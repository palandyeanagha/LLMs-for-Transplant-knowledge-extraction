Oligonucleotides are nucleic acid polymers with the 
potential to treat or manage a wide range of diseases. 
Although the majority of oligonucleotide therapeutics 
have focused on gene silencing, other strategies are being 
pursued, including splice modulation and gene activa￾tion, expanding the range of possible targets beyond 
what is generally accessible to conventional pharma￾ceutical modalities. The majority of oligonucleotide 
modalities interact with their cognate target molecules 
via complementary Watson–Crick base pairing, and 
so interrogation of the putative target sequence is rela￾tively straightforward. Highly specific lead compounds 
can often be rationally designed based on knowledge of 
the primary sequence of a target gene alone and lead 
candidates identified by rapid screening. By contrast, 
conventional small-molecule pharmaceuticals require 
much larger, and often iterative, screening efforts fol￾lowed by extensive medicinal chemistry optimiza￾tion. In addition, the use of oligonucleotides allows for 
precision and/or personalized medicine approaches 
as they can theoretically be designed to selectively 
target any gene with minimal, or at least predictable, 
off-target effects. Furthermore, it is possible to target 
patient-specific sequences that are causative of rare 
disease1
, specific alleles (for example, SNPs or expanded 
repeat-containing mutant transcripts can be preferen￾tially targeted without silencing the wild-type mRNA2–5
), 
distinct transcript isoforms6
, pathogenic fusion tran￾scripts (for example, Bcr–Abl7
), traditionally ‘undrug￾gable’ targets (for example, proteins that may lack 
hydrophobic pockets that may accommodate a small 
molecule that also inhibits protein activity)8,9
 and viral 
sequences that evolve resistance to an oligonucleotide 
therapy (whereby the oligonucleotide design is modified 
to compensate for acquired escape mutations)10.
In addition to their ability to recognize specific tar￾get sequences via complementary base pairing, nucleic 
acids can also interact with proteins through the for￾mation of three-dimensional secondary structures — a 
property that is also being exploited therapeutically. For 
example, nucleic acid aptamers are structured nucleic 
acid ligands that can act as antagonists or agonists for 
specific proteins11 (Box 1). Similarly, guide RNA mole￾cules contain hairpin structures that bind to exogenously 
introduced Cas9 protein and direct it to specific genomic 
DNA loci for targeted gene editing12 (Box 2). An in-depth 
discussion of these modalities is beyond the scope of this 
Review.
As of January 2020, ten oligonucleotide drugs have 
received regulatory approval from the FDA (Fig. 1; 
Table 1). However, a major obstacle preventing wide￾spread usage of oligonucleotide therapeutics is the dif￾ficultly in achieving efficient delivery to target organs 
and tissues other than the liver. In addition, off-target 
interactions13–17, sequence and chemistry-dependent 
toxicity and saturation of endogenous RNA process￾ing pathways18 must also be carefully considered. The 
most commonly used strategies employed to improve 
nucleic acid drug delivery include chemical modifica￾tion to improve ‘drug-likeness’, covalent conjugation to 
cell-targeting or cell-penetrating moieties and nanopar￾ticle formulation. More recently developed approaches 
such as endogenous vesicle (that is, exosome) loading, 
spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), nanotechnology appli￾cations (for example, DNA cages) and ‘smart’ materials 
are also being pursued.
This Review will provide an overview of 
oligonucleotide-based drug platforms and focus on 
recent advances in improving oligonucleotide drug 
delivery.
Advances in oligonucleotide drug 
delivery

Abstract | Oligonucleotides can be used to modulate gene expression via a range of processes 
including RNAi, target degradation by RNase H-mediated cleavage, splicing modulation, 
non-coding RNA inhibition, gene activation and programmed gene editing. As such, these 
molecules have potential therapeutic applications for myriad indications, with several 
oligonucleotide drugs recently gaining approval. However, despite recent technological 
advances, achieving efficient oligonucleotide delivery, particularly to extrahepatic tissues, 
remains a major translational limitation. Here, we provide an overview of oligonucleotide-based 
drug platforms, focusing on key approaches — including chemical modification, bioconjugation 
and the use of nanocarriers — which aim to address the delivery challenge.

Oligonucleotide-based platforms
Antisense oligonucleotides. Antisense oligonucleotides 
(ASOs) are small (~18–30 nucleotides), synthetic, 
single-stranded nucleic acid polymers of diverse chem￾istries, which can be employed to modulate gene expres￾sion via various mechanisms. ASOs can be subdivided 
into two major categories: RNase H competent and steric 
block. The endogenous RNase H enzyme RNASEH1 
recognizes RNA–DNA heteroduplex substrates that are 
formed when DNA-based oligonucleotides bind to their 
cognate mRNA transcripts and catalyses the degradation 
of RNA19. Cleavage at the site of ASO binding results in 
destruction of the target RNA, thereby silencing target 
gene expression (Fig. 2a). This approach has been widely 
used as a means of downregulating disease-causing 
or disease-modifying genes20. To date, three RNase 
H-competent ASOs have received regulatory approval; 
fomivirsen, mipomersen and inotersen (Fig.  1a–c;
Table 1).
Current-generation RNase H-competent ASOs gen￾erally follow the ‘gapmer’ pattern, whereby a central 
DNA-based ‘gap’ is surrounded by RNA-based (but 
chemically modified) flanking regions that promote 
target binding21 (Fig. 1b,c). Notably, RNASEH1 is active 
in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus22,23, thereby ena￾bling the targeting of nuclear transcripts (for example, 
immature pre-mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) that 
may be less accessible to other technologies (for example, 
small interfering RNA (siRNA); see below).
Steric block oligonucleotides are ASOs that are 
designed to bind to target transcripts with high affin￾ity but do not induce target transcript degradation as 
they lack RNase H competence. Such oligonucleotides 
therefore comprise either nucleotides that do not form 
RNase H substrates when paired with RNA or a mixture 
of nucleotide chemistries (that is, ‘mixmers’) such that 
runs of consecutive DNA-like bases are avoided.
Steric block oligonucleotides can mask specific 
sequences within a target transcript and thereby inter￾fere with transcript RNA–RNA and/or RNA–protein 
interactions. The most widely used application of steric 
block ASOs is in the modulation of alternative splicing 
in order to selectively exclude or retain a specific exon(s) 
(that is, exon skipping and exon inclusion, respectively). 
In these cases, the oligonucleotide ‘masks’ a splicing 
signal such that it becomes invisible to the spliceosome, 
leading to alterations in splicing decisions24,25. Typically, 
such splice correction approaches have been used to 
restore the translational reading frame in order to res￾cue production of a therapeutic protein26,27. However, 
the same technology can also be used for splice cor￾ruption, whereby an exon is skipped in order to disrupt 
the translation of the target gene28 (Fig. 2b). Given that 
alternative splicing is responsible for much proteomic 
diversity, it is possible that steric block oligonucleotides 
may also be utilized to promote isoform switching, 
thereby diminishing the expression of harmful protein 
isoforms and/or promoting the expression of beneficial 
ones. To date, three splice-switching ASOs have been 
FDA-approved; eteplirsen, golodirsen and nusinersen 
(Fig. 1d–f).
Notably, steric block ASOs have also been demon￾strated to inhibit translation inhibition29,30 (Fig. 2c), 
interfere with upstream open reading frames that neg￾atively regulate translation31 in order to activate protein 
expression32 (Fig. 2d), inhibit nonsense-mediated decay in 
a gene-specific manner by preventing assembly of exon 
junction complexes33 and influence polyadenylation 
signals to increase transcript stability34 (Fig. 2e).
RNAi — precision duplex silencers. siRNA molecules are 
the effector molecules of RNAi and classically consist of 
a characteristic 19 + 2mer structure (that is, a duplex 
of two 21-nucleotide RNA molecules with 19 comple￾mentary bases and terminal 2-nucleotide 3ʹ overhangs)35. 
One of the strands of the siRNA (the guide or antisense 
strand) is complementary to a target transcript, whereas 
the other strand is designated the passenger or sense 
strand. siRNAs act to guide the Argonaute 2 protein 
(AGO2), as part of the RNA-induced silencing complex 
(RISC), to complementary target transcripts. Complete 
complementarity between the siRNA and the target 
transcript results in cleavage (that is, slicer activity) of 
the target opposite position 10–11 of the guide strand, 
catalysed by AGO2 (refs36–38), leading to gene silencing 
(Fig. 2f). As of May 2020, two siRNAs have received FDA 
approval: patisiran and givosiran (Fig. 1g,h; Table 1).
Numerous variations of the archetypal siRNA design 
have provided benefits in terms of reduced passenger 
strand activity and/or improved potency. These include 
Dicer substrate siRNAs39, small internally segmented 
siRNAs40, self-delivering siRNAs (asymmetric and 
hydrophobic)41, single-stranded siRNAs42,43 and divalent 
siRNAs44.
Box 1 | Aptamers — evolved nucleic acid ligands
Aptamers are structured, single-stranded nucleic acid molecules (typically ~20–100 
nucleotides) that fold into defined secondary structures and act as ligands that interact 
with target proteins by way of their three-dimensional structure and adaptive fit11. 
In contrast with other kinds of nucleic acid therapeutics, aptamers are not rationally 
designed. Instead, they are generated by an in vitro evolution methodology called 
SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment)286–288. Pegaptanib 
(originally developed by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals and Eyetech Pharmaceuticals) 
(Fig. 1i; Table 1), an RNA-based aptamer that targets the VEGF-165 vascular endothelial 
growth factor isoform as an anti-angiogenic therapy for neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration, is currently the only aptamer approved for clinical use.
Aptamers have primarily been used to target extracellular targets (for example, 
receptors), which somewhat simplifies the delivery problem for this class of 
oligonucleotide. However, as with other RNA species, RNA aptamers are rapidly 
degraded in most extracellular environments, meaning that chemical modification 
of aptamers is essential for in vivo activity. SELEX can be performed with libraries of 
chemically modified RNAs to a limited extent, as some nucleotide analogues, such as 
2ʹ-fluoro and 2ʹ-O-methyl, are tolerated in both reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA 
polymerase enzymatic steps289,290. The introduction of post-SELEX chemical 
modifications is an alternative approach to further enhance aptamer drug-like 
properties.
The inherent chirality of amino acids in nature, in turn, enforces chirality in 
enzymatically produced nucleic acids (that is, l-amino acids and d-nucleotides). 
However, SELEX can be performed using enantiomeric protein analogues of target 
proteins synthesized with unnatural d-amino acids. The resulting aptamers are 
necessarily composed of d-RNA as a consequence of the restrictions of the enzymatic 
SELEX steps. However, the l-RNA versions of these identified aptamers can now be 
generated by chemical synthesis, which will thereby recognize the natural l-protein. 
These highly stable ‘mirror image’ aptamers are called spiegelmers (or l-RNA aptamers) 
and are not substrates for natural nucleases291.

microRNA inhibition. microRNAs (miRNAs) are endo￾genous RNAi triggers that have been implicated in a 
multitude of physiological and pathophysiological pro￾cesses, including cancer45,46, cell cycle progression47, infec￾tious disease48,49, immunity50, diabetes51, metabolism52, 
myogenesis53,54 and muscular dystrophy55,56. miRNAs 
therefore constitute a rich class of putative drug tar￾gets. miRNA hairpins embedded within long primary 
miRNA transcripts are sequentially processed by 
two RNase III family enzymes, DICER1 (Dicer) and 
DROSHA, which liberate the hairpin and then cleave the 
loop sequence, respectively37,57,58. The resulting duplex 
RNA (analogous to an siRNA) is loaded into an argo￾naute protein (for example, AGO2) and one strand dis￾carded to generate the mature, single-stranded miRNA 
species. As with siRNAs, miRNAs guide RISC to target 
sequences where they initiate gene silencing. In contrast 
with siRNAs, miRNAs typically bind with partial com￾plementarity and induce silencing via slicer-independent 
mechanisms59,60.
Steric block ASOs have been extensively utilized to 
competitively inhibit miRNAs via direct binding to the 
small RNA species within the RISC complex61 (Fig. 2g). 
Such ASOs are known as anti-miRNA oligonucleotides, 
anti-miRs or antagomirs62. The first anti-miRNA drug 
to enter clinical trials was miravirsen63 (later called 
SPC3649, Santaris Pharma A/S/Roche; Table 2), which 
is an ASO designed to treat chronic hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection via targeting of the liver-specific 
miRNA miR-122. This miRNA binds to two sites in the 
5ʹ untranslated region of the HCV viral RNA and thereby 
stabilizes it48,64–68. Miravirsen sequesters miR-122, leav￾ing the viral RNA exposed to exonucleolytic degrada￾tion with a concomitant failure of the virus to replicate 
and a reduction in viral load. Despite miravirsen show￾ing promising results in terms of viral suppression, 
a rebound in HCV load was eventually observed in 
patient serum67, and an escape mutation that renders 
the HCV genome refractory to miravirsen has also been 
reported69. A rival anti-miR-122 drug, RG-101 (Regulus 
Therapeutics), for the treatment of HCV infection was 
similarly developed, but both miravirsen/SPC3649 and 
RG-101 are no longer in clinical development. Notably, 
Regulus is also developing anti-miRNA oligonucleo￾tide drugs targeting miR-21 for Alport nephropathy70
and miR-17 for polycystic kidney disease71 (Table 2). 
Similarly, miRagen Therapeutics is developing 
cobomarsen, an oligonucleotide inhibitor of miR-155 
for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma72, and 
remlarsen, a double-stranded mimic of miR-29 for the 
treatment of keloids73 (Table 2).
An alternative approach to miRNA inhibition is the 
use of steric block ASOs to inhibit a specific miRNA reg￾ulatory interaction via masking of the target sequence 
on an mRNA transcript74,75 (Fig. 1g). However, the poten￾tial of steric block ASOs to disrupt these and other 
trans-acting regulators of RNA expression has yet to be 
fully realized.
Transcriptional gene activation. Many gene loci 
express long non-coding RNA species (for example, 
promoter-associated RNA and natural antisense tran￾scripts, NATs) that are often involved in the transcrip￾tional repression of the proximal protein-coding gene 
(or genes)76. Targeting these long non-coding RNAs 
with ASOs or siRNAs (referred to as antagoNATs77 or 
small activating RNAs78) can reverse the effects of this 
negative regulation leading to transcriptional activation 
(or ‘unsilencing’; Fig. 2h), as has been shown in the case 
of numerous disease-relevant genes including BACE1
(Alzheimer disease)79, BDNF (Parkinson disease)80, 
UBE3A (Angelman syndrome)81 and SCN1A (Dravet 
syndrome)82, among others. Alternatively, small activat￾ing RNAs can recruit epigenetic remodelling complexes 
to activate transcription via a distinct mechanism83,84
(Fig. 2i). Similarly, there is a growing appreciation of 
the importance of endogenous small RNAs in the 
nucleus that function as natural mediators of such 
transcriptional gene activation or silencing events, and 
may themselves constitute targets for oligonucleotide 
therapeutics85,86.
MiNA Therapeutics is currently developing MTL￾CEBPA, a small activating RNA targeting CEBPA87,88
(CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α, a key transcrip￾tion factor involved in hepatocyte differentiation and 
tumour suppression) delivered as a lipid nanoparticle 
formulation, as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(Table 2). This drug is the first gene-activating oligo￾nucleotide to be tested in a phase I clinical trial in patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis89.
An alternative approach for specific gene activation 
is the TANGO (Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear 
Gene Output) method currently under development by 
Stoke Therapeutics (Table 2). This strategy takes advan￾tage of naturally occurring non-productive alternative 
splicing events, which result in premature termination 
Box 2 | Nucleic acid-programmable nucleases
The discovery that the CRISPR–Cas9 system could be repurposed for use in mammalian 
cells has led to a renaissance in the field of gene editing12. This system, which evolved as 
a form of bacterial immune defence against invading bacteriophages292–294, consists of a 
protein component (that is, the Cas9 enzyme that introduces double-stranded DNA 
breaks) and one or more guide RNA components (for example, the single guide RNA 
that directs Cas9 to a specific target site in genomic DNA). The modularity of the 
system allows for testing of many potential single guide RNAs, whereas the protein 
component is invariant. By contrast, previous gene editing approaches (for example, 
meganuclease, zinc finger nucleases and TALENs (transcription activator-like effector 
nucleases)) required costly and time-consuming protein engineering in order to confer 
target specificity. The CRISPR–Cas9 system induces double-strand breaks at specific 
genomic DNA loci, which are subsequently repaired by one of several DNA repair 
mechanisms. Such editing can be used to knockout a gene by disrupting the 
translational reading frame, excise a specific region from the genome, repair a point 
mutation or knock-in a desired DNA sequence. Furthermore, nuclease-deficient Cas9 
variants (dCas9) have been developed that interact with target DNA sequences but do 
not induce double-strand breaks. dCas9 fusions with transcriptional activation (VPR; 
VP64-p65-Rta)295 or silencing proteins (KRAB)
296 can therefore be used to target these 
fusion proteins to specific promoter sequences, and thereby modulate gene expression 
without inducing permanent changes in the DNA sequence. The majority of CRISPR–
Cas9 gene editing therapies are dependent on the use of viral vectors for delivery of the 
effector components. The development of a compact Cas9 enzyme derived from 
Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) has enabled the delivery of the CRISPR system using 
adeno-associated viral vectors297. However, non-viral approaches using Cas9 
ribonucleoprotein complexes loaded with synthetic oligonucleotide guide RNAs are also 
being developed298. These include gold nanoparticles (CRISPR–gold)299, liposomes300,301
and cell-penetrating peptide-modified Cas9 (ref.
302).

codon generation and transcript degradation via 
nonsense-mediated decay. Splice-correcting ASOs are 
targeted to the sites of non-productive alternative splic￾ing products to promote the generation of the produc￾tive transcript isoform, thereby upregulating target gene 
expression (Stoke Therapeutics’ science).
Delivery challenges
Achieving effective delivery of oligonucleotide ther￾apeutics to many tissues remains a major transla￾tional challenge. Oligonucleotides are typically large, 
hydrophilic polyanions (single-stranded ASOs are 
~4–10 kDa, double-stranded siRNAs are ~14 kDa), 
properties that mean they do not readily pass through 
the plasma membrane. For activity, systemically injected 
nucleic acid drugs must resist nuclease degradation in 
the extracellular space90, bypass renal clearance91,92, 
evade non-productive sequestration by certain plasma 
proteins93, avoid removal by the reticuloendothelial 
system (that is, mononuclear phagocytes, liver sinusoi￾dal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells)94, cross the cap￾illary endothelium at the desired target cell(s) within 
an organ/tissue by paracellular or transcellular routes, 
traverse the plasma membrane, escape the endolyso￾somal system before lysosomal degradation or re-export 
via exocytosis95 and arrive at the correct intracellular 
site of action. Systemic delivery to the central nerv￾ous system (CNS) presents an additional obstacle, as 
oligonucleotide-based therapeutics are generally not able 
to traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB).
To date, the majority of oligonucleotide therapeutics 
(and almost all of the approved nucleic acid drugs) have 
focused on either local delivery (for example, to the eye 
or spinal cord) or delivery to the liver. The eye is con￾sidered an immune-privileged organ, meaning that this 
has been an anatomical target of choice for gene and

oligonucleotide therapies (for example, pegaptanib and 
fomivirsen). Conversely, direct injection of oligonucleo￾tides into the cerebrospinal fluid via lumbar puncture 
has been demonstrated to result in a favourable distri￾bution of therapeutic molecules throughout the CNS 
(for example, nusinersen)96. The liver is a highly per￾fused tissue, with a discontinuous sinusoidal endothe￾lium, meaning that uptake of free oligonucleotides and 
larger nanoparticles can occur rapidly before renal 
clearance. The liver also contains very high concentra￾tions of receptors that can facilitate uptake and/or are 
rapidly recycled (for example, scavenger receptors and 
the asialoglycoprotein receptor). Although other highly 
vascularized tissues with discontinuous or fenestrated 
endothelia, such as the kidneys and spleen, are also 
sites for oligonucleotide accumulation, the develop￾ment of effective technologies for extrahepatic systemic 
delivery remains a major goal for the oligonucleotide 
therapeutics field.
Strategies to enhance delivery
Chemical modification. Chemical modification repre￾sents one of the most effective approaches to enhance 
oligonucleotide drug delivery. Modification of the 
nucleic acid backbone, the ribose sugar moiety and 
the nucleobase itself has been extensively employed 
in order to improve the drug-like properties of oligo￾nucleotide drugs and thereby enhance delivery92,97
(Fig. 3). Specifically, modification is utilized to improve 
oligonucleotide pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
and biodistribution. Specific patterns of modification 
are also required for the functionality of certain thera￾peutic modalities (for example, gapmers). The impor￾tance of chemistry is exemplified by the observation that 
extensive chemical modification of second-generation 
gapmer ASOs is sufficient to enable delivery to a wide 
variety of tissues, without the need for an additional 
delivery agent98. Furthermore, of the ten approved 
oligonucleotide therapies approved to date (Table 1), 
eight are ‘naked’ (that is, lacking an additional delivery 
vehicle) and so are dependent on chemical modifica￾tion alone to facilitate their tissue delivery. This is also 
true of gapmer ASOs currently in development by Ionis 
Pharmaceuticals, including drugs for the treatment of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, cen￾tronuclear myopathy and, most notably, Huntington 
disease99 (Table 2).
Backbone modification. The incorporation of phos￾phorothioate (PS) linkages (Fig. 3), in which one of the 
non-bridging oxygen atoms of the inter-nucleotide 
phosphate group is replaced with sulfur, is widely used 
in therapeutic oligonucleotides100. There are many 
other kinds of backbone modification (for exam￾ple, boranophosphate101), although these have been 
less commonly used. PS backbone modifications are 
readily tolerated in ASO designs and do not disrupt 
RNase H activity. By contrast, siRNAs that contain PS 
modifications at every linkage are less active than the 
equivalent phosphodiester (PO) siRNA102, and, as such, 
PS-containing siRNAs are typically modified at the 
termini only, if at all. Sulfated molecules, such as oligo￾nucleotides containing PS linkages or thiol tails, are also 
taken up by scavenger receptors (such as the stabilins 
STAB1 and STAB2), which mediate their internalization 
into tissues such as the liver103–105. The incorporation of 
PS linkages has the dual effect of conferring nuclease 
resistance and promoting binding to proteins in both 
plasma and within cells. Oligonucleotide interactions 
with plasma proteins such as albumin106 have the effect 
of improving drug pharmacokinetics by increasing the 
circulation time (and therefore reducing renal clear￾ance). However, binding of a PS-containing gapmer ASO 
to plasma α2-macroglobulin (A2M) was found to be 
non-productive93. PS modification of oligonucleotides 
also increases interactions with intracellular proteins 
(for example, nucleolin107–111) that are believed to pro￾mote their accumulation in the nucleus, the target site of 
action for splice-switching oligonucleotides.
Notably, resistance to cellular nucleases results in pro￾longed tissue retention and long-lasting drug effects. In 
cases where this is undesirable, in the case of toxicity due 
to prolonged gene silencing for example, the incorpora￾tion of one or more PO linkages can be used to ‘tune’ the 
durability of the oligonucleotide by reducing its nuclease 
stability112.
A disadvantage of PS backbone modifications is that 
they have the effect of reducing the binding affinity of 
an oligonucleotide for its target, a limitation that can be 
compensated for by incorporating additional types of 
modification (discussed below).
Fig. 2 | Oligonucleotide-mediated gene regulatory mechanisms. a | Gapmer 
antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), consisting of a DNA-based internal ‘gap’ and 
RNA-like flanking regions (often consisting of 2ʹ-O-methyl (2ʹ-OMe) or locked nucleic 
acid (LNA) modified bases) bind to target transcripts with high affinity. The resulting 
RNA–DNA duplex acts as a substrate for RNASEH1, leading to the degradation of the 
target transcript. b | Steric block oligonucleotides targeted to pre-mRNA splicing signals 
modulate alternative splicing to either promote exon skipping or exon inclusion 
(depending on the type of splicing signal targeted). The resulting mature mRNA species 
can be spliced in a productive manner (for example, to restore the reading frame or to 
switch to an alternative isoform) or in a non-productive manner (for example, to remove 
an exon that is required for protein function and/or to disrupt the translation reading 
frame). c | Steric block antisense oligonucleotides can disrupt translation initiation by 
targeting the AUG start codon. d | Some transcripts contain upstream open reading 
frames (uORFs) that modulate the translational activity of the primary open reading frame 
(pORF). Targeting the uORF with steric block ASOs disrupts this regulation, leading to 
activation of pORF translation. e | Transcript stability can be modulated by shifting the 
usage of cleavage and polyadenylation signals. For example, a steric block ASO targeted 
to a distal polyadenylation signal results in the preferential usage of a weaker proximal 
polyadenylation signal. The resulting shorter transcript is more stable as it lacks RNA 
destabilization signals. f| Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) enter the RNA-induced 
silencing complex (RISC), which consists of Argonaute 2 protein (AGO2), DICER1 
and TARBP2, and the passenger strand is discarded. The guide strand directs the 
RISC to complementary target genes that are cleaved by the slicer activity of AGO2. 
g | Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) are loaded into miRISC. miRNA activity can be 
inhibited by steric block ASOs that either complex with the mature miRNA loaded 
in the RISC complex or by masking a target site through interactions with the targeted 
transcript. h | Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) recruit epigenetic silencing complexes, 
such as PRC2, to a sense gene locus. Interference of the epigenetic modifier protein 
association with the NAT using steric block ASOs or degradation of the NAT via siRNA or 
gapmer ASO results in ‘unsilencing’ of the sense gene. i | Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) 
can recruit the RNA-induced transcriptional activation (RITA) complex (consisting of 
AGO2, CTR9 and DDX5 (ref.
285)) to low-copy promoter-associated RNA, leading to 
transcriptional activation of the proximal gene. EZH2, Enhancer of zeste homolog 2;

and pathogens from crossing

Stereochemistry. The introduction of an additional sul￾fur atom in a PS linkage results in the generation of a 
chiral centre at each modified phosphorous atom, with 
the two possible stereoisomeric forms (designated Sp
and Rp, respectively) (Fig. 3). As such, a fully PS back￾bone 20mer oligonucleotide is in fact a racemic mixture 
of the 219 possible permutations (that is, more than half 
a million different molecules). The physicochemical 
properties of each stereocentre are distinct in terms of 
hydrophobicity/ionic character, nuclease resistance, 
target affinity and RNase H activity113. In particular, a 
3ʹ-SpSpRp-5ʹ ‘stereochemical code’ contained within the 
‘gap’ region of gapmer ASOs was found to be particularly 
active113. Wave Life Sciences has developed a scalable 
method of synthesizing oligonucleotides with defined 
stereochemistry at each PS linkage113, and is advanc￾ing oligonucleotide drugs with defined stereochem￾istry for various indications. However, they recently 
discontinued development of suvodirsen, a stereopure 
ASO designed to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
(DMD) via skipping of dystrophin exon 51, owing to lack 
of efficacy in a phase I clinical trial114. Parallel clinical 
programmes with stereopure oligonucleotides targeting 
Huntington disease and C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia are ongoing (Table 2).
It is intriguing to speculate that the racemic mixtures 
of oligonucleotide drugs currently approved or in devel￾opment contain many stereoisomers that exhibit low 
activity, thereby reducing the overall potency of the bulk 
mixture, and a small number of hyperfunctional mol￾ecules. Identification of the most active stereoisomers 
would provide a major step forwards in oligonucleo￾tide drug development, allowing for lower doses with 
more efficacious compounds. Notably, it has been sug￾gested that a stereorandom mixture of Sp and Rp centres 
is required to balance stability and silencing activity115. 
Nucleotide stereochemistry has also been exploited for 
aptamer development (Box 1).

Nucleobase modification. Strategies to modify nucleo￾base chemistry are also being investigated. For exam￾ple, pyrimidine methylation (5-methylcytidine and 
5-methyluridine/ribothymidine) (Fig. 3) has the effect of 
increasing the oligonucleotide melting temperature by 
~0.5 °C per substitution97, and has been commonly incor￾porated into ASOs (such as those under development 
by Ionis Pharmaceuticals).
In addition, abasic nucleotides (that is, nucleotides 
lacking a nucleobase) (Fig. 2) have been used to abrogate 
miRNA-like silencing while maintaining on-target slicer 
activity116 and for allele-specific silencing of mutant HTT
and ATXN3 transcripts117.
Terminal modification. Phosphorylation of the 5ʹ ter￾minus of the siRNA guide strand is essential for activity, 
as this group makes an important contact in the MID 
domain of AGO2 (refs118,119). Removal of this terminal 
phosphate group by cellular phosphatases therefore has 
the effect of reducing siRNA potency. The addition of 
a 5ʹ-(E)-vinylphosphonate modification acts as a phos￾phate mimic that is not a phosphatase substrate. This 
modification also protects against exonuclease degra￾dation and enhanced silencing in vivo120. Similarly, ter￾minal inverted abasic ribonucleotides have been used 
to block exonuclease activity121. The conjugation of 
delivery-promoting moieties to oligonucleotide termini 
is discussed below.
Ribose sugar modification. Oligonucleotides are fre￾quently modified at the 2ʹ position of the ribose sugar. 
Combinations of DNA (2ʹ-deoxy) and RNA bases are 
critical to the activity of gapmer ASOs (that is, for gen￾erating RNase H substrate heteroduplexes), and are uti￾lized on the 3ʹ termini of some siRNA designs in order 
to confer nuclease resistance35.
Similarly, 2ʹ-O-methyl (2ʹ-OMe), 2ʹ-O-methoxyethyl 
(2ʹ-MOE) and 2ʹ-Fluoro (2ʹ-F) (Fig. 3) are among the 
most commonly used 2ʹ substituents. These modifica￾tions increase oligonucleotide nuclease resistance by 
replacing the nucleophilic 2ʹ-hydroxyl group of unmod￾ified RNA, leading to improved stability in plasma, 
increased tissue half-lives and, consequently, prolonged 
drug effects. Furthermore, these modifications also 
enhance the binding affinity of the oligonucleotide for 
complementary RNA by promoting a 3ʹ-endo pucker 
conformation (RNA-like) of the ribose122,123. These 
2ʹ-ribose modifications are not compatible with RNase 
H activity, meaning they are typically used for steric 
block oligonucleotides, or for the flanking sequences in 
gapmer ASOs. Although 2ʹ substitutions that enhance 
binding affinity are not improvements in delivery per se, 
they can compensate for limited drug bioavailability as 
the fraction of the injected dose that reaches its intended 
target is more active.
For steric block and gapmer ASOs, the oligonucleo￾tide simply needs to bind to its cognate target (and 
support RNase H cleavage with a DNA gap in the case 
of the latter). For siRNAs, the situation is more com￾plex as the oligonucleotides must maintain the capacity 
for loading into an AGO2 protein and support slicer 
cleavage. However, extensive chemical modification 
has been reported using 2ʹ-OMe and 2ʹ-F chemistries124, 
and active siRNAs have been generated in which every 
single 2ʹ-hydroxyl is modified, suggesting that the 
RNAi machinery is remarkably tolerant of chemical 
modification125,126. Furthermore, full chemical modifi￾cation has been shown to be highly important for the 
activity of siRNA bioconjugates127 (discussed below). 
Conversely, the introduction of 2ʹ-ribose modifications 
at certain specific positions can ablate RISC loading and 
silencing activity. This phenomenon has been exploited 
in order to inactivate the passenger strand of the siRNA 
duplex, and thereby minimize its potential to mediate 
off-target silencing effects128.
2ʹ-MOE modifications are not typically incorpo￾rated into siRNA designs (the one exception being 
single-stranded siRNAs42). Alnylam Pharmaceuticals 
has developed two patterns of siRNA chemical modi￾fication that form the basis for many of the products in 
their development pipeline129. The first is standard tem￾plate chemistry, which consist of an alternating pattern 
of 2ʹ-F and 2ʹ-OMe modifications at all ribose positions. 
This design was shown to increase siRNA potency by 
more than 500-fold relative to the unmodified PO siRNA 
in some cases126. The now-discontinued drug revusiran 
(Table 2), targeting TTR for transthyretin amyloidosis, 
is an example of a standard template chemistry siRNA 
design130. The second approach is termed enhanced 
stability chemistry, in which siRNAs contain a greater 
proportion of 2ʹ-OMe than standard template chemistry 
siRNAs and also incorporate PS linkages at the two inter￾nucleotide bridges at the 3ʹ terminus of the guide strand 
and the 5ʹ termini of both strands129,131. The approved 
Alnylam drug givosiran (Fig. 1h) is an example of an 
enhanced stability chemistry siRNA design.
2ʹ-OMe modifications can also abrogate the immune 
responses that can be induced by ASOs, siRNAs and 
CRISPR guide RNAs (Box 2). These oligonucleotide drugs 
have the potential to stimulate immune reactions in both 
sequence and chemistry-dependent ways via cellular 
pattern recognition receptors located in the cytoplasm 
or endosome121,132,133. Specifically, the Toll-like receptors 
can induce the interferon response: TLR3 recognizes 
double-stranded RNA motifs; TLR7 and TLR8 recognize 
single-stranded RNA; and TLR9 recognizes unmethyl￾ated CpG dinucleotides134,135. Similarly, the RIG-I and 
PKR systems also recognize double-stranded RNA in 
the cytoplasm136. Some of these immunogenic effects of 
siRNAs can be ablated by the inclusion of 2ʹ-OMe mod￾ifications at key positions137,138. Conversely, incorpora￾tion of 5ʹ-triphosphate-modified oligonucleotides139, 
or conjugation with CpG motif-containing TLR9 
agonists140,141, and other chemical modifications142 have 
been used to generate therapeutic immunostimulatory 
oligonucleotides.
Bridged nucleic acids. Bridged nucleic acids (BNAs) are 
types of nucleotide in which the pucker of the ribose sugar 
is constrained in the 3ʹ-endo conformation via a bridge 
between the 2′ and 4′ carbon atoms. The most commonly 
used variations are locked nucleic acid (LNA)143,144, 
2′,4′-constrained 2′-O-ethyl (constrained ethyl) BNA 
(cEt) and, to a lesser extent, 2′‐O,4′‐C‐ethylene‐bridged 
www.nature.com/nrd
Reviews
682 | October 2020 | volume 19

nucleic acid (ENA)145,146 (Fig. 3). BNAs enhance both 
nuclease stability and the affinity of the oligonucleotide 
for target RNA (typically by an increase of 3–8 °C in melt￾ing temperature per modified nucleotide in the case of 
LNA147). BNA modifications have therefore been incor￾porated into the flanking regions of gapmers to improve 
target binding. As such, cEt-flanking 3–10–3 gapmers 
are more efficacious than the MOE 5–10–5 equivalents98. 
Conversely, BNA nucleotides are not compatible with 
RNase H-mediated cleavage and so are excluded from 
the DNA gap region. LNA modifications have also been 
utilized in steric block ASOs, such as miRNA inhibitors. 
For example, miravirsen and cobomarsen (discussed 
above) are both full PS ASO mixmers containing DNA 
and LNA modifications distributed throughout their 
sequences. Conversely, tiny LNAs are short (8mer) fully 
LNA-modified oligonucleotides designed to simulta￾neously inhibit multiple members of an miRNA family 
(as these may execute redundant physiological functions) 
through complementarity to the miRNA seed sequence 
that is common between family members148.
Alternative chemistries. Whereas the majority of oligo￾nucleotides are derived from RNA or DNA, other chem￾istries have been developed that differ substantially from 
these natural archetypes. PMO (phosphorodiamidate 
morpholino oligonucleotide) is a charge-neutral nucleic 
acid chemistry in which the five-membered ribose 
heterocycle is replaced by a six-membered morpho￾line ring149,150 (Fig. 3). Sarepta Therapeutics is develop￾ing PMO-based steric block ASOs for exon skipping 
in the context of DMD (Table 2). To date, two PMO 
drugs have been approved by the FDA, eteplirsen and 
golodirsen (Fig. 1d,e; Table 1), which target exons 51 
and 53 of the dystrophin mRNA, respectively. Sarepta 
is also developing further ASO products based on the 
same chemistry targeting dystrophin exons 43, 44, 45 
(casimersen), 50, 52 and 55 (Sarepta Therapeutics’ pipe￾line) (Table 2). Additionally, Nippon Shinyaku Pharma 
recently published encouraging data on a rival exon 
53-targeting PMO (viltolarsen, NS-065/NCNP-01)151 and 
received marketing authorization in Japan in March 2020 
(see Related links) (Table 2).
Notably, PMO backbone linkages contain chiral cen￾tres, meaning that PMO drugs are necessarily racemic 
mixtures. In contrast with PS modifications described 
above, the effects of defined PMO stereochemistry have 
not been explored to date.
Another strategy that has been explored is the use 
of peptide nucleic acid (PNA), a nucleic acid mimic 
in which a pseudo peptide polymer backbone substi￾tutes for the PO backbone of DNA/RNA152,153 (Fig. 3). 
As both PMOs and PNAs are uncharged nucleic acid 
molecules, they can be covalently conjugated to charged 
delivery-promoting moieties such as cell-penetrating 
peptides (CPPs) (discussed below). Conversely, a dis￾advantage of these chemistries is that both PMO and 
PNA interact minimally with plasma proteins, meaning 
that they are rapidly cleared via urinary excretion.
The use of a constrained DNA analogue that increases 
the stability of RNA target–oligonucleotide duplexes 
by 2.4 °C per modification, known as tricyclo-DNA 
(tcDNA) (Fig. 3), is also being investigated154. Interestingly, 
systemically administered tcDNA ASOs were shown to 
exhibit activity in the brain, suggesting that these mole￾cules have the capacity to deliver oligonucleotides across 
the BBB155. Given the non-natural structures of PMO, 
PNA and tcDNA, these chemistries are less suitable to 
RNase H and RNAi applications but have instead been 
used in steric block oligonucleotides, and for splice cor￾rection in particular155–157. However, tcDNA has recently 
been incorporated into the flanking sequences of a 
gapmer designed to silence mutant HTT transcripts158.
A final example is the development of a novel short 
interfering ribonucleic neutral (siRNN) chemistry159. 
These siRNN molecules contain a modified phospho￾triester structure that neutralizes the charge of the equiv￾alent unmodified PO/PS linkages, and thereby promotes 
their uptake in recipient cells. siRNNs act as prodrugs, 
which are converted to classical siRNAs by thioesterases 
in the cytoplasm159.
Bioconjugation. The delivery potential of ASOs and 
siRNAs can be enhanced through direct covalent con￾jugation of various moieties that promote intracellular 
uptake, target the drug to specific cells/tissues or reduce 
clearance from the circulation. These include lipids 
(for example, cholesterol that facilitates interactions 
with lipoprotein particles in the circulation)160–162, pep￾tides (for cell targeting and/or cell penetration)5,163–167, 
aptamers168, antibodies9,169 and sugars (for example, 
N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc))170,171. Bioconjugates 
constitute distinct, homogeneous, single-component 
molecular entities with precise stoichiometry, mean￾ing that high-scale synthesis is relatively simple and 
their pharmacokinetic properties are well defined. 
Furthermore, bionconjugates are typically of small size 
(relative to nanoparticle approaches, discussed below), 
meaning that they generally exhibit favourable bio￾distribution profiles (on account of being able to reach 
tissues beyond those with discontinuous or fenestrated 
endothelia).
For siRNAs there are four termini to which conju￾gates could potentially be attached. However, conjuga￾tion to the 5ʹ terminus of the guide strand is avoided 
as this terminal phosphate makes specific contacts with 
side-chain residues within the MID domain of AGO2 
that are required for RNAi activity118,119. Conjugation to 
the passenger strand is generally preferred so as not 
to encumber the on-target silencing activity of the guide 
strand and, conversely, to diminish the off-target gene 
silencing potential of the passenger strand. Conjugates 
can be designed such that they are disassembled fol￾lowing cellular entry. This can be achieved by using 
acid-labile linkers that are cleaved in the endosome, 
disulfide linkers that are reduced in the cytoplasm or 
Dicer substrate-type siRNA designs172.
A common theme in oligonucleotide bioconjugation 
approaches is the promotion of interactions between 
the conjugate and its corresponding cell surface recep￾tor protein, leading to subsequent internalization by 
receptor-mediated endocytosis. The interaction of bio￾conjugates with cell type-associated receptors thereby 
enables targeted delivery to specific tissues, or cell types 
Endocytosis
The process of internalization 
of material (for example, 
nanoparticles) into the cell. 
There are multiple distinct 
mechanisms of endocytosis, 
including clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis, caveolae￾mediated endocytosis and 
micropinocytosis.

within a tissue. To date, the physiological effects of satu￾rating such receptor pathways have not been extensively 
studied173.
Lipid conjugates. Covalent conjugation to lipid mole￾cules has been used to enhance the delivery of siRNAs 
and antagomir ASOs. Cholesterol siRNAs (conjugated 
to the 3ʹ terminus of the passenger strand) (Fig. 4a) have 
been utilized for hepatic gene silencing (for exam￾ple, Apolipoprotein B, Apob)161 and, more recently, to 
silence myostatin (Mstn) in murine skeletal muscle 
(a target organ in which it has historically been par￾ticularly challenging to achieve effective RNAi) after 
systemic delivery174. Other lipid derivatives have also 
been exploited to enhance siRNA delivery. For exam￾ple, siRNAs conjugated to α-tocopherol (vitamin E) 
were reported to induce potent silencing of Apob in the 
mouse liver175. In this case, the lipid moiety was con￾jugated to the 5ʹ terminus of the passenger strand of a 
Dicer substrate siRNA 27/29mer duplex. Upon cellular 
entry, the siRNA is cleaved by Dicer so as to generate 
the mature 19+2mer active RNAi trigger and to simul￾taneously cleave off the α-tocopherol175. Similarly, siRNAs 
conjugated to long-chain (>C18) fatty acids via a 
trans-4-hydroxyprolinol linker attached to the 3ʹ end of 
the passenger strand were capable of inducing compa￾rable levels of Apob silencing to cholesterol-conjugated 
siRNAs160. The in vivo activity of lipid-conjugated siRNAs 
was demonstrated to be dependent on their capacity to 
bind to lipoprotein particles (for example, HDL and LDL) 
in the circulation160 and, thereby, hijack the endogenous 
system for lipid transport and uptake. Pre-assembly of 
cholesterol siRNAs with purified HDL particles resulted 
in enhanced gene silencing in the liver and jejunum 
relative to cholesterol siRNAs alone160. Furthermore, 
lipoprotein particle pre-assembly was also shown to 
affect siRNA biodistribution, with LDL siRNA parti￾cles taken up almost exclusively in the liver, and HDL 
siRNA particles primarily taken up by the liver, and also 
the adrenal glands, ovary, kidney and small intestine160. 
Accordingly, endocytosis of cholesterol siRNAs was 
shown to be mediated by scavenger receptor-type 
B1 (SCARB1, SR-B1) or LDL receptor (LDLR) for HDL 
and LDL particles, respectively160. In vivo association of 
siRNAs with the different classes of lipoprotein is gov￾erned by their overall hydrophobicity, with the more 
hydrophobic conjugates preferentially binding to LDL 
and the less lipophilic conjugates preferentially binding 
to HDL176.
GalNAc conjugates. GalNAc is a carbohydrate moiety 
that binds to the highly liver-expressed asialoglyco￾protein receptor 1 (ASGR1, ASPGR) with high affinity 
(Kd=2.5nM)177 and facilitates the uptake of PO ASOs178,179
and siRNAs into hepatocytes by endocytosis129,170,171,180. 
ASGR1 is very highly expressed in the liver, and is rap￾idly recycled to the cell membrane, making it an ideal 
receptor for effective liver-targeted delivery. The interac￾tion between GalNAc and ASGR1 is pH-sensitive, such 
that dissociation of the receptor and oligonucleotide 
conjugate occurs during acidification of the endosome129. 
The GalNAc moiety is subsequently subject to enzy￾matic degradation that liberates the oligonucleotide179. 
GalNAc-conjugated ASOs are preferentially delivered 
to hepatocytes in vivo, whereas unconjugated ASOs are 
primarily detected in non-parenchymal liver cells179.
Typically, a triantennary GalNAc structure (Fig. 4b)
is used as the conjugated moiety, although there are 
other structural variants129,181. GalNAc conjugation 
enhanced ASO potency by ~7-fold in mouse, specific 
to the liver179, and by ~30-fold in human patients182. 
As such, GalNAc conjugation is now one of the leading 
strategies for delivering experimental oligonucleotide 
drugs currently in development, given its high liver 
silencing potential, small size relative to nanoparticle 
complexes, defined chemical composition and low 
cost of synthesis. In particular, GalNAc conjugation 
features heavily in the drug development pipelines of 
several pharma companies, most notably Alnylam, who 
are developing drugs for the treatment of diseases such 
as haemophilia A and B and primary hyperoxaluria 
type 1 (Table 2). Furthermore, a GalNAc-conjugated 
siRNA, givosiran (developed by Alnylam), received 
FDA approval in November 2019 (Table 1). Givosiran is 
a GalNAc-conjugated, blunt-ended, enhanced stability 
chemistry siRNA duplex targeting 5ʹ-aminolevulinate 
synthase 1 (ALAS1) for the treatment of acute hepatic 
porphyria183. Similarly, inclisiran, a second GalNAc￾conjugated siRNA containing 2ʹ-F, 2ʹ-OMe and PS 
modifications (developed by Alnylam/The Medicines 
Company and acquired by Novartis184), is in late-stage 
clinical trials for the treatment of familial hypercho￾lesterolaemia (Table 2). Inclisiran targets PCSK9 (pro￾protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), which is a 
circulating factor that negatively regulates expression 
of LDLR and is primarily expressed in the liver. Hepatic 
PCSK9 knockdown therefore increases the availa￾bility of LDLR to remove LDL cholesterol from the 
circulation185,186. Subcutaneous injection of inclisiran 
resulted in long-term downregulation of circulating 
PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol (~6 months) suggesting

that an infrequent treatment regimen may be a sufficient 
lipid-lowering strategy180,187.
Numerous additional pharmaceutical companies — 
namely Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Silence Therapeutics, 
Arbutus Biopharma and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals — 
are also developing GalNAc-conjugated oligonucleotide 
products (Table 2).
Antibody and aptamer conjugates. Although there is a 
plethora of technologies capable of delivering nucleic 
acids to hepatic cells, there is still a need for strategies 
that can target cell surface receptors specific to other tis￾sues. Antibodies have been used as delivery vehicles for 
other kinds of drugs188, although their utility for oligo￾nucleotide delivery is still in the early stages of develop￾ment. Specific interactions between an antibody and a 
cell surface receptor have the potential to enable delivery 
to tissues and/or cell subpopulations that are not acces￾sible using other technologies. Various receptors have 
been successfully targeted for siRNA delivery (Fig. 4d), 
including the HIV gp160 protein169, HER2 (ref.
189), 
CD7 (T cell marker)190, CD71 (transferrin receptor, 
highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle)191 and 
TMEFF2 (ref.
192). Similarly, ASOs have also been conju￾gated with antibodies against CD44 (a neural stem cell 
marker), EPHA2 and EGFR193. In these cases, the ASO 
was delivered as a duplex with a DNA carrier strand to 
which the antibody was attached via click chemistry194. 
Such a design allows the DNA passenger to be degraded 
after cellular entry, thereby releasing the ASO from the 
complex194. Antibody–siRNA and antibody–ASO con￾jugates targeting tissues such as skeletal muscle are cur￾rently being developed by Avidity Biosciences (Table 2)
and Dyne Therapeutics, respectively.
Similarly, the conjugation of therapeutic oligo￾nucleotides to nucleic acid aptamers (Box 1) has also been 
explored for enhancing delivery of siRNAs and ASOs 
to specific target cells168,195,196. Aptamers can be consid￾ered ‘chemical antibodies’ that bind to their respective 
target proteins with high affinity, but present numerous 
advantages over antibodies as they are simple and inex￾pensive to manufacture (that is, by chemical synthesis), 
are smaller in size and exhibit lower immunogenicity197.
Peptide conjugates. Peptides are an attractive source 
of ligands that may confer tissue/cell-targeting, 
cell-penetrating (that is, CPPs) or endosomolytic prop￾erties onto therapeutic oligonucleotide conjugates. 
CPPs (also known as protein transduction domains) are 
short (typically <30 amino acids) amphipathic or cati￾onic peptide fragments that are typically derived from 
naturally occurring protein translocation motifs (as in 
the case of HIV-TAT (transactivator of transcription 
protein), Penetratin 1 (homeodomain of the Drosophila
Antennapedia protein) and Transportan (a chimeric pep￾tide consisting of part of the galanin neuropeptide fused 
to the wasp venom, mastoparan)) or are based on poly￾mers of basic amino acids (that is, arginine and lysine)198. 
One of the most promising applications of CPPs is their 
direct chemical conjugation to charge-neutral ASO 
chemistries, such as PMO and PNA. Several groups have 
pioneered the use of peptide–PMO (PPMO) conjugates 
(Fig. 4e) for the treatment of various diseases, most nota￾bly for dystrophin splice switching in the context of 
DMD. Early PPMO dystrophin exon skipping studies 
demonstrated efficacy using (RXR)4-PMO199,200 and the 
‘B’ peptide (with sequence (RXRRBR)2XB)199,201, where 
X and B are 6-aminohexanoic acid and β-alanine spacer 
residues, respectively. The spacer residues are impor￾tant for the optimal positioning of the charged arginine 
side chains202,203. This approach was further modified by 
generating a chimeric peptide consisting of B peptide 
fused with a muscle-targeting peptide (MSP)204. The 
resulting B–MSP–PMO conjugates demonstrated fur￾ther dystrophin restoration efficacy in the mdx mouse 
model of DMD (although the relative arrangement of 
the peptide constituents was found to be important, 
with MSP–B–PMO exhibiting low activity)204,205. Exon 
skipping activity has also been reported when PMOs 
were conjugated to a different muscle-targeting peptide 
(M12) identified by phage display, although activity in 
the heart was minimal206. Subsequently, several series 
of peptides known as ‘Pip’s (PMO/PNA internalization 
peptide) consisting of R, B and X amino acids with an 
internal core containing hydrophobic residues have 
been developed164,207–209. Current-generation Pip–PMO 
conjugates (Fig. 4e) are much more potent than naked 
PMO in dystrophic animal models and, importantly, 
reach cardiac muscle (a tissue critical to the lethality 
of DMD) after systemic delivery164,209–211. The PPMO 
hydrophobic core is required for cardiac delivery, but 
can itself be scrambled, inverted, or individual residues 
substituted with only minimal changes to efficacy164,209. 
A major challenge for PPMO technology is toxicity, with 
evidence of renal damage in both rat (at very high doses) 
and cynomolgus monkey studies using arginine-rich 
CPP–PMOs212,213. Notably, the arginine content of the 
CPP is correlated with both exon skipping activity and 
nephrotoxicity209, and so current research efforts are 
directed towards the optimization of peptide chemistry 
to mitigate renal toxicity without compromising splice 
correction efficacy. Sarepta Therapeutics is developing 
SRP-5051, a PPMO designed to skip dystrophin exon 51 
(Table 2). Additionally, PepGen Ltd is commercializing 
PPMO technology (Table 2).
PPMO uptake is energy dependent and appears to 
involve distinct endocytic pathways in skeletal and car￾diac muscle cells214. It has been reported that treatment 
of chloroquine can enhance PPMO activity, suggest￾ing that many conjugate molecules may not escape the 
endolyosomal compartment215. PPMOs have also been 
shown to spontaneously form micelles of defined sizes 
and surface charge, meaning that they are more readily 
taken up by endocytosis, in part mediated by scavenger 
receptors104.
PPMO technology has also been demonstrated to be 
effective for targeting CUG repeat-expanded transcripts 
in the context of myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) 
(whereas naked PMO was completely ineffective)5
, 
for splice correction to restore BTK expression for the 
treatment of X-linked agammaglobulinaemia216 and for 
delivery to the CNS in animal models of spinal muscular 
atrophy211. Similarly, brain delivery (to the cerebellum 
and Purkinje cells in particular) of an arginine-rich 
www.nature.com/nrd

686 | October 2020 | volume 19

CPP–PMO conjugate after systemic delivery has also 
been demonstrated217.
PPMOs are also promising antibacterial (as they 
are capable of traversing the bacterial cell wall) and 
antiviral agents. Intranasal administration of (RXR)4
peptide–PMO conjugates targeting an essential bacte￾rial gene acpP in murine infection models was shown 
to be bactericidal and increased survival218. Further, 
arginine-rich peptide–PMO conjugates were shown to 
exert protective effects in murine viral infection models 
of SARS-CoV219,220 and Ebola221.
Conjugation of peptides to charged-backbone oligo￾nucleotides has been explored to a much lesser extent, 
as charge–charge interactions between the constituents 
complicate synthesis and purification, and conjugates 
may have the potential to self-aggregate. Nevertheless, 
there are a few examples of such conjugates. It was 
recently demonstrated that conjugation of an ASO gap￾mer to a ligand for the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor 
(GLP1R) conferred targeted gene silencing in pancreatic 
β-cells166, the pancreas being a particularly challenging 
organ to deliver to. In this case, the targeting moiety 
was a 40-amino acid peptide consisting of a modified 
GLP1 sequence covalently conjugated to the ASO via 
the carboxy terminus. Peptide conjugation has also been 
explored for siRNA delivery. For example, the cyclic 
RGD peptide (recognized by αvβ3 integrin receptors) has 
successfully been used to deliver anti-VEGFR2 siRNA 
conjugates to mouse tumours167. Similarly, the CPPs 
TAT(48–60) and penetratin have been utilized as siRNA 
conjugates for delivery to the lung via the intratracheal 
route222. Although modest silencing of the target gene was 
observed, administration of the unconjugated peptides 
alone also exhibited a repressive effect. Furthermore, 
treatment with the penetratin–siRNA conjugates was 
associated with the release of pro-inflammatory markers 
TNF, IL-12 p40 and IFNα222. These observations high￾light that potential peptide-mediated non-specific effects 
on gene expression and innate immune activation must 
be carefully considered.
Nanocarriers. Advances in nanotechnology and mat￾erial science offer advantages and potential solutions to 
the challenge of oligonucleotide drug delivery, in par￾ticular the requirements for crossing biological barriers 
and transmembrane intracellular delivery. The major 
advantages of nanoparticle delivery systems include 
bespoke optimization of nanoparticle biophysical (for 
example, size, shape and chemical/material compo￾sition) and biological (for example, ligand function￾alization for targeting) properties, allowing for highly 
tailored delivery platforms. A wide range of nanocarri￾ers for nucleic acid drug delivery are at various stages of 
development, including non-covalent complexation with 
cationic polymers (for example, polyethylenimine)223, 
dendrimers224,225, CPPs (for example, MPG-8 (ref.
226), 
PepFect6 (ref.
227), RVG-9R228, and Xentry-KALA229) and 
inorganic methods (for example, calcium phosphate 
nanoparticles)230. Below, we focus on lipid-based formu￾lations for oligonucleotide delivery and emerging novel 
approaches including endogenously derived exosomes, 
SNAs and self-assembling DNA nanostructures.
Lipoplexes and liposomes. Formulation with lipids is 
one of the most common approaches to enhancing 
nucleic acid delivery. Mixing polyanionic nucleic acid 
drugs with lipids leads to the condensing of nucleic 
acids into nanoparticles that have a more favourable 
surface charge, and are sufficiently large (~100 nm in 
diameter) to trigger uptake by endocytosis. Lipoplexes 
are the result of direct electrostatic interaction between 
polyanionic nucleic acid and the cationic lipid, and 
are typically a heterogeneous population of relatively 
unstable complexes. Lipoplex formulations need to be 
prepared shortly before use, and have been success￾fully used for local delivery applications228. By contrast, 
liposomes comprise a lipid bilayer, with the nucleic 
acid drug residing in the encapsulated aqueous space. 
Liposomes are more complex (typically consisting of 
cationic or fusogenic lipids (to promote endosomal 
escape231) and cholesterol PEGylated lipid) and exhibit 
more consistent physical properties with greater stabil￾ity than lipoplexes232. For example, some lipid nano￾particles (LNPs), also known as stable nucleic acid lipid 
particles (Fig. 4f), are liposomes that contain ionizable 
lipid, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG–lipid 
conjugates233,234 in defined ratios and have been suc￾cessfully utilized in multiple instances. Landmark 
examples are the silencing of hepatitis B virus and 
APOB by siRNAs in preclinical animal studies137,235 and, 
more recently, the approval of patisiran, an siRNA that 
is delivered as an LNP formulation236. Encapsulation 
of nucleic acid cargos provides a means of protection 
from nuclease digestion in the circulation and in the 
endosome. Additionally, ionizable LNPs also associate 
with APOE, which further facilitates liver uptake via 
LDLR-mediated endocytosis237. Similarly, LNPs con￾taining lipidoid or lipid-like materials have demon￾strated robust siRNA-mediated silencing in rodents238,239
and non-human primates240.
A disadvantage of LNPs is that their delivery is pri￾marily limited to the liver and reticuloendothelial system 
as the sinusoidal capillary epithelium in this tissue pro￾vides spaces large enough to allow the entry of these rela￾tively large nanoparticles137,241,242. However, local delivery 
of LNPs has been used to successfully deliver siRNAs 
to the CNS after intracerebroventricular injection243. 
Conversely, the large size of nanoparticles is advanta￾geous as it essentially precludes renal filtration244 and 
permits delivery of a higher payload.
LNPs can be further functionalized with peptides245, 
PEG246 or other ligands that confer cell-specific target￾ing (for example, GalNAc (hepatocytes)234,237, anisamide 
(lung tumours)247, strophanthidin (various tumours)248
and vitamin A (hepatic stellate cells)249). Notably, an 
increase in the complexity of LNPs complicates manu￾facture and may increase their toxicity, which is a major 
concern that may limit their clinical utility. For exam￾ple, LNP siRNA particles (such as patisiran) require pre￾medication with steroids and antihistamines to abrogate 
unwanted immune reactions250.
Exosomes. An area of nanotechnology that is gaining 
interest is based on the application of natural bio￾logical nanoparticles known as exosomes (a class of 
NAture RevIewS | DRug DISCOveRy
Reviews
 volume 19 | October 2020 | 687

extracellular vesicle). Exosomes are heterogeneous, lipid 
bilayer-encapsulated vesicles approximately 100nm in 
diameter that are generated as a result of the inward 
budding of the multivesicular bodies251,252. Exosomes are 
thought to be released into the extracellular space by 
all cells, where they facilitate intercellular communica￾tion via the transfer of their complex macromolecular 
cargoes (that is, nucleic acids, proteins and lipids)253,254. 
Exosomes present numerous favourable properties in 
terms of oligonucleotide drug delivery: exosomes are 
capable of traversing biological membranes, such as 
the BBB255; the presence of the marker protein CD47 
protects exosomes from phagocytosis, thereby increas￾ing their circulation time relative to liposomes256; 
exosomes are considered non-toxic and have been 
safely administered to patients with graft-versus-host 
disease257; exosomes have the potential to be produced 
in an autologous manner; exosomes from some sources 
have been shown to have inherent pro-regeneration and 
anti-inflammatory properties that may augment the 
effects of therapeutic oligonucleotide delivery258,259; and 
engineered exosomes can serve as a modular platform 
whereby combinations of therapies and/or targeting 
moieties can be deployed.
A major challenge for exosome therapeutics is the 
efficient loading of therapeutic oligonucleotide cargo. 
Vesicles can be loaded either endogenously (for example, 
by overexpression of the cargo in the producer cell line260) 
or exogenously (for example, by electroporation255,256,261, 
sonication262, co-incubation with cholesterol-conjugated 
siRNAs263,264 and so forth). The loading of exosomes with 
splice-switching PMOs has been achieved via conjuga￾tion with the CP05 peptide, which binds to CD63 (a 
marker commonly found on exosomes) so as to decorate 
the exosomes with PMO cargo265.
The pattern of exosome biodistribution can be 
favourably altered through the display of surface ligands, 
such as peptides like rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) to 
enhance brain penetration and facilitate delivery to cells 
within the nervous system255,266,267 (Fig. 4g) or GE11 that 
promotes binding to tumour cells by interacting with 
EGFR268. Similarly, exosomes decorated with an RNA 
aptamer targeting PSMA (prostate-specific membrane 
antigen) were capable of delivering siRNAs to xenograft 
tumours and inducing tumour regression269.
Methods for the manufacture of therapeutic 
exosomes at high scale, including clinical grade, have 
been reported261. The use of mesenchymal stem cell lines 
(with the potential for immortalization) and culture in 
bioreactors enables large volumes of exosome-containing 
conditioned media to be generated. Subsequently, meth￾ods such as tangential flow filtration and size-exclusion 
liquid chromatography provide a scalable means of iso￾lating therapeutic exosomes from these supernatants270. 
Therapeutic applications of engineered exosome tech￾nology are presently at an advanced preclinical stage 
for two companies: Codiak Biosciences and Evox 
Therapeutics.
Spherical nucleic acids. An alternative nanoparticle￾based delivery strategy is the SNA approach. SNA 
particles consist of a hydrophobic core nanoparticle 
(comprising gold, silica or various other materials) 
that is decorated with hydrophilic oligonucleotides (for 
example, ASOs, siRNAs and immunostimulatory oligo￾nucleotides) that are densely packed onto the surface 
via thiol linkages (Fig. 4h). In contrast to other nano￾particle designs, SNA-attached oligonucleotides radiate 
outwards from the core structure. While exposed, the 
oligonucleotides are protected from nucleolytic degrada￾tion to some extent as a consequence of steric hindrance, 
high local salt concentration, and through interactions 
with corona proteins271.
SNA particles carrying an siRNA targeting the 
anti-apoptotic factor Bcl2l12 were able to promote 
tumour apoptosis, reduce the tumour burden and extend 
survival in glioblastoma xenograft-bearing mice272. 
Importantly, this study demonstrated that SNAs have 
the potential to cross the BBB in both tumour-bearing 
mice (with impaired BBB integrity) and also in wild￾type mice272, although the majority of SNA particles 
were deposited in the liver and kidneys. SNA parti￾cles have also been applied for topical delivery to skin 
keratinocytes in the context of diabetic wound healing 
(that is, GM3S-targeting siRNA)273 and psoriasis (that 
is, TNF-targeting ASO)274. SNA particles are currently 
being commercialized for oligonucleotide delivery 
applications by Exicure, Inc.
DNA nanostructures. DNA nanostructures, of which 
there are many varieties, have also been utilized for 
oligonucleotide delivery. These structures include DNA 
origami, whereby long DNA molecules are held in 
defined structures using short DNA ‘staples’ that enable 
a wide variety of complex shapes to be formed, includ￾ing polygonal nanostructures such as DNA cages. DNA 
nanostructures typically self-assemble owing to base 
pairing complementarity of their constituent parts, and 
can be designed with precise geometries such that their 
physical properties (for example, size, flexibility and 
shape) can be fine-tuned in order to maximize their 
delivery potential. DNA nanostructures used for nucleic 
acid delivery applications will typically be modular 
structures that incorporate nucleic acid drugs (and tar￾geting ligands such as aptamers) within the design of the 
structure itself. For example, DNA nanostructures have 
been designed that incorporate ASOs (Fig. 4i), siRNAs275
and immunostimulatory oligonucleotides276 displayed 
on the structure surface. A highly interesting property 
of DNA nanostructures is that they have been reported 
to not accumulate in the liver, and can be engineered to 
be small (~20 nm), meaning extrahepatic delivery is 
possible. However, further reducing the size of DNA 
nanostructures without additional functionalization 
will likely result in enhanced renal filtration, and overall 
lower bioavailability275,277.
Stimuli-responsive nanotechnology. Stimuli-sensitive, 
activatable drug delivery nanotechnologies are emerg￾ing as oligonucleotide delivery solutions. Activatable 
CPP conjugates consist of an oligonucleotide cova￾lently attached to a peptide that is folded into a hair￾pin structure. One half of the hairpin is arginine rich 
and positively charged, whereas the second half of the 
Multivesicular bodies
Membrane-bound 
compartments within cells that 
contain intraluminal vesicles 
that form as a consequence 
of inward budding of the 
multivesicular body membrane. 
When multivesicular bodies fuse 
with the plasma membrane, 
their intraluminal vesicles are 
released into the extracellular 
space and are now considered

peptide is negatively charged and acts as a neutralizing 
inhibitory domain. The loop of the hairpin contains 
an enzymatic cleavage motif, allowing for activation of 
the conjugate when it reaches the desired site of action. 
Activation by matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) 
has been utilized to enable targeted delivery of siRNA 
to hepatoma cells in vitro278 and in xenograft tumours 
in vivo279. Similarly, dynamic polyconjugates consist of 
oligonucleotides conjugated to a scaffold that is linked 
to multiple delivery-assisting moieties. For example, an 
siRNA-dynamic polyconjugate consisting of a PBAVE 
scaffold polymer linked to PEG and NAG (N-acetyl 
glucosamine, for liver targeting) moieties by acid-labile 
linkers induced potent gene silencing in mouse hepato￾cytes after intravenous administration280. The acidic 
environment of the endosome induces cleavage of 
the PEG and NAG groups, leading to exposure of the 
PBAVE tertiary amines, buffering of luminal pH and 
consequent endosomal escape280.
Even more complex ‘smart’ delivery vehicles are pos￾sible with DNA nanotechnology. For example, DNA 
origami has been used to generate a box that is opened 
and incorporates two structure-shifting aptamer ‘locks’. 
When both aptamers interact with their target proteins, 
the lock opens and the DNA box changes conformation 
to release its contents281. This technology was utilized to 
deliver gold nanoparticles and antibody fragments but 
could potentially be modified for nucleic acid delivery. 
Such logic-gated delivery vehicles present numerous 
advantages as therapeutic payloads could be concen￾trated at the desired sites of action, leading to higher 
efficacy and reduced off-target effects. Technologies that 
can confer stimuli-responsiveness (for example, to pH, 
temperature, redox state, enzymatic activity, magnetic 
fields and light) in nanoparticle drug delivery systems 
have been reviewed elsewhere282.
Challenges and considerations
The establishment of therapeutic platforms capable of 
delivering oligonucleotide drugs to specific organs or 
tissues will likely involve defined patterns of chemical 
modification, combined with conjugation/complexa￾tion strategies that confer predictable pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic properties, and well-understood 
mechanisms of action. In this manner, oligonucleotide 
therapeutics have the potential to extend the range of 
possible pharmaceutical targets and provide a means 
by which new drugs can be rapidly developed to meet 
unmet and emerging clinical needs, without the need 
to ‘start from scratch’. Such a situation is exemplified 
by the case of milasen, an ASO drug designed as a 
personalized drug for a single patient suffering from 
Batten disease. Milasen was designed using the same 
full PS–2ʹ-MOE design as nusinersen (Fig. 1f; Table 1), 
an FDA-approved chemistry that distributes favourably 
throughout the CNS after intrathecal administration, 
resulting in a period of less than 1 year between iden￾tification of the patient’s mutation and the first admin￾istration of the ASO drug1
. Whether such a model of 
drug development is scalable to more patients remains 
to be seen, although the n-Lorem Foundation aims to 
use bespoke ASO drugs to treat patients with ultra-rare 
diseases, where conventional clinical trials are impossi￾ble. However, a key issue will be how the safety of differ￾ent drug sequences using the same chemistry/delivery 
platform will be viewed by regulatory authorities.
Although LNPs and GalNAc conjugates offer excel￾lent hepatic delivery in both preclinical and clinical 
studies, systemic delivery beyond the liver will require 
further investigation, innovation and development. In 
many cases, approved oligonucleotide drugs will likely 
be extremely, and possibly prohibitively, expensive. For 
example, nusinersen currently costs $750,000 for the 
first year and $375,000 in subsequent years. Similarly, 
the cost of eteplirsen is $300,000 per annum. The cost–
benefit ratio for highly effective, life-changing med￾ications such as nusinersen is likely to be favourable. 
By contrast, reimbursing the cost of eteplirsen, which 
has demonstrated very limited efficacy, will be much 
more difficult to justify. Importantly, drug costs should 
also be weighed against the cost of care for patients left 
untreated283. As oligonucleotide therapeutics are further 
combined with novel delivery modalities, such advances 
may compound the cost of materials. However, the 
improved efficacy and/or better targeted delivery 
afforded by such delivery technologies may mean that 
lower doses of drug can be administered, which may 
conversely reduce costs. Another key consideration 
is safety. While the immune-stimulating properties 
of standard nucleic acid modification chemistries are 
relatively well understood, the potential immunogenic￾ity of delivery agent components or ligand conjugates 
may present additional challenges to safe and effective 
oligonucleotide drug delivery.
Given the large number of nucleic acid chemistries, 
delivery technologies and therapeutic modalities, direct 
head-to-head comparisons are unlikely to be possible 
in many cases. This issue is further compounded when 
considering the diversity of possible stereoisomers if 
chiral backbone modifications are used. The applica￾tion of artificial intelligence and computer modelling 
may be one way to address these issues. Nevertheless, 
the approval of two oligonucleotide drugs with different 
mechanisms of action for the same indication (that is, 
inotersen and patisiran, a gapmer ASO and an siRNA, 
respectively; Fig. 1; Table 1) does at least allow for direct 
comparison of these approaches.
Outlook
Numerous recent, high-profile regulatory approvals 
have demonstrated that oligonucleotide drug delivery 
has now matured to the position of clinical utility for 
multiple diverse indications. The utility of highly opti￾mized combinations of nucleic acid chemical modifi￾cations, conjugation to cell/tissue-targeting ligands and 
nanoparticle carrier systems has enhanced the efficiency 
of oligonucleotide drug delivery and/or is enabling 
therapeutic molecules to reach previously inaccessible 
target tissues. These developments provide hope that 
therapy for many rare or currently untreatable dis￾eases will soon be possible through the use of precision 
genetic medicine.
