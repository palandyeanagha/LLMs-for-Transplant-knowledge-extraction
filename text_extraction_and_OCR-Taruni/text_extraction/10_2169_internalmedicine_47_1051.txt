Abstract
Disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular
complications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The term “renal osteodystrophy” has recently
been replaced with “CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)”, which includes vascular calcification as
well as bone abnormalities. Following this paradigm shift, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy released
guidelines for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic dialysis patients, which priori￾tized improvement in survival, but not in bone abnormalities. According to these guidelines, parathyroid in￾tervention, such as parathyroidectomy and percutaneous ethanol injection therapy, should be indicated if min￾eral disorders cannot be managed by pharmacological means. Recently, several novel therapeutic tools, in￾cluding sevelamer hydrochloride, calcitriol analogs, and cinacalcet hydrochloride have been introduced in the
clinical setting in Japan. Harmonizing these therapeutic modalities, we should expect more effective manage￾ment of CKD-MBD, leading to the improvement of morbidity and mortality in this patient population.

Introduction
The kidney plays a leading role in maintaining calcium
and phosphorus homeostasis in collaboration with other or￾gans, i.e., the parathyroid gland, intestines, and bones. It is
not only the target organ for various hormones, such as
parathyroid hormone (PTH), but also the principal site for
the production of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).
Thus, along with the progression of chronic kidney disease
(CKD), various abnormalities of mineral and bone metabo￾lism develop, which can result in significant consequences
(1). Traditionally, such disorders have been considered with
regard to the bone lesion itself, but it has become increas￾ingly evident that mineral and bone disorders have a critical
role in the pathogenesis of extraskeletal calcification includ￾ing the vasculature, thereby resulting in cardiovascular com￾plications and mortality. Thus, in place of the term ‘renal
osteodystrophy (ROD)’, a new term, ‘CKD-mineral and
bone disorders (CKD-MBD)’ has recently been proposed to
describe this broad clinical syndrome that develops as a sys￾temic disorder (Fig. 1) (2). Following this paradigm shift,
the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT) released
the Guidelines for the Management of Secondary Hyper￾parathyroidism in Chronic Dialysis Patients, which priori￾tized on improvement in survival, but not in bone abnor￾malities (3, 4). Here, we review the current strategies for the
treatment of CKD-MBD.
Target Levels for Serum Phosphorus,
Calcium, and PTH
Current clinical guidelines, such as the Kidney Disease
Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines, recom￾mend that serum levels of calcium and phosphorus should
be maintained within the target range to avoid the develop￾ment of vascular calcification (5). The focus of these guide￾lines was to regard mineral and bone disorders as systemic

diseases, and to improve survival. Most Japanese nephrolo￾gists accepted the policy of the K/DOQI guidelines and the
JSDT guidelines reflecting on the paradigm shift that is
gaining popularity worldwide. At that time, however, few
studies examined the association between mineral metabo￾lism and mortality in Japan. Therefore, the JSDT database
was analyzed to reveal such associations and establish origi￾nal target levels for serum phosphorus, calcium, and para￾thyroid hormone (PTH), in consideration of the different
medical and social backgrounds in Japan. As a result, the
mortality risk revealed a U-shaped pattern along the phos￾phorus and calcium levels (6) and the target value was de￾termined to be 3.5―6.0 mg/dL and 8.4―10.0 mg/dL, respec￾tively (3, 4).
The target intact PTH proposed by the K/DOQI is 150-
300 pg/mL, which aims at the mild change in the type of
bone tissue, because the action of PTH on bone is decreased
in dialysis patients (5, 7). By contrast, the JSDT established
the target intact PTH based on its direct relationship with
mortality, but not its relative relationship with the bone le￾sions. The analysis of the JSDT database showed a gentle J
curve of PTH with 60 pg/mL at the bottom (6), and the tar￾get value was determined to be 60―180 pg/mL (3, 4). As for
the priority of control of each parameter of bone mineral
metabolism, several cohort studies have demonstrated that
the PTH-mortality relation was weaker than the phosphorus￾mortality or calcium-mortality relations (8, 9). Accordingly,
the JSDT guidelines prioritized the control of serum phos￾phorus and calcium over suppression of PTH secretion (3,
4).
Control of Hyperphosphatemia
Among the risk factors related to vascular calcification,
hyperphosphatemia is evidently the major contributing fac￾tor. It is well known that vascular calcification is not a sim￾ple process of passive mineralization, but also includes sev￾eral mechanisms similar to bone formation that are exempli￾fied by upregulation of osteochondrogenic differentiation
markers (10-12). Phosphate retention also stimulates PTH
secretion and induces parathyroid hyperplasia either directly
or indirectly (13, 14). In addition, higher serum phosphorus
and calcium-phosphorus product levels are associated with
the progression of CKD (15). Thus, there is every reason to
control the serum phosphorus levels in patients with CKD.
Dietary phosphorus restriction and conventional dialysis
alone are usually ineffective in controlling hyperphos￾phatemia, hence, most dialysis patients require phosphorus
binders. Aluminum-based binders were once used exten￾sively, but were abandoned when aluminum was found to
contribute to anemia, myopathies, dementia, and low￾turnover bone disease (16). Since then, calcium-based bind￾ers have predominantly been in use, but they have been
linked to arterial calcification observed in hemodialysis pa￾tients (17). Recently, non-calcium and non-aluminum-based
binders such as sevelamer hydrochloride have been intro￾duced in clinical practice in Japan. Several studies have sug￾gested that excessive calcium intake may worsen vascular
calcification (17), and that the progression of coronary vas￾cular calcification was slower in patients on sevelamer, than
in those on calcium-based phosphorus binders (18, 19);
therefore, the K/DOQI guidelines restricted the total dose of
calcium carbonate to 3,750 mg/day, and recommended the
use of sevelamer, especially for patients with hypercalcemia
(5). In the JSDT guidelines, the total dose of calcium car￾bonate was restricted to 3,000 mg/day, in consideration of
the body size of Japanese patients (3, 4).
Despite the possible beneficial effects of sevelamer on the
progression of vascular calcification, it is unknown whether
the choice of a phosphorus binder is likely to improve the
survival outcome of dialysis patients. It has recently been
shown that the use of calcium-based binders in an incident
dialysis population was associated with a significantly
higher mortality rate when compared to sevelamer (20). By
contrast, the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited study
failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality in
patients treated with sevelamer compared to those receiving
calcium-based phosphorus binders, except for individuals
over 65 years of age (21). Therefore, the use of sevelamer
should be considered on a case-by-case basis, until further
well-designed studies clearly show its superiority over the
calcium-based phosphorus binder. Given that many Japanese
patients suffer from adverse events such as severe constipa￾tion, combination treatment with sevelamer and calcium car￾bonate may be effective and tolerable (22).
A new salt form of sevelamer carbonate has recently been
developed and is in the experimental stage (23). This new
agent seems to be especially useful in patients with CKD
who are not yet receiving hemodialysis, because it does not
induce hyperchloremic acidosis. It is also promising for cur￾rent hemodialysis patients, as it eliminates the need for

monitoring of metabolic acidosis.
Lanthanum carbonate is an alternative effective phospho￾rus binder that can facilitate phosphorus control while limit￾ing calcium intake (24). Despite the possibility of metal ac￾cumulation in tissues over time like aluminum-based bind￾ers, there is no evidence from preclinical studies that lantha￾num can cross blood-tissue barriers including the blood￾brain barrier. A two-year comparative study of lanthanum
carbonate versus standard therapy, demonstrated that lantha￾num carbonate is effective and does not adversely affect
cognitive function compared to the standard therapy (25).
Lanthanum carbonate was also highly effective in Japanese
dialysis patients (26). However, it should be noted here that
the increase in lanthanum carbonate concentration in the
liver, lung, and kidney has been reported in an animal
model of renal failure (27), although this finding has been
challenged as a contamination artifact (28). Further clinical
studies are required to establish the long-term safety of lan￾thanum regarding tissue deposition, and its efficacy on vas￾cular calcification and mortality.
Management of Secondary
Hyperparathyroidism
Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism is the cor￾nerstone in the management of CKD-MBD. It is well estab￾lished that phosphorus retention and calcitriol deficiency
play critical roles in the pathogenesis of secondary hyper￾parathyroidism (29). Recent clinical studies revealed that fi￾broblast growth factor 23, a newly identified phosphaturic
factor, is progressively elevated to prevent hyperphos￾phatemia in CKD, at the expense of low calcitriol and hy￾perparathyroidism (30, 31). Thus, rigorous control of serum
phosphorus levels and administration of calcitriol or its ana￾logs are the mainstream treatment for secondary hyperpara￾thyroidism (5).
Before initiating treatment for secondary hyperparathy￾roidism, clinicians should recall the JSDT guidelines, which
state that normalization of serum phosphorus and calcium
concentrations is a prerequisite for PTH control (3, 4). Cal￾citriol has been shown to suppress PTH secretion effectively
and inhibit cell proliferation in parathyroid hyperplasia (32,
33), but this treatment may increase the risk for hypercalce￾mia and hyperphosphatemia, resulting in withdrawal or a re￾duction in the dose of calcitriol. To overcome these prob￾lems, new calcitriol analogs with less calcemic action than
calcitriol, such as paricalcitol (34), doxercalciferol (35),
maxacalcitol (36), and falecalcitriol (37) have been devel￾oped. Among these, maxacalcitol and falecalcitriol are now
commercially available in Japan. However, even maxacalci￾tol treatment readily induces hypercalcemia in patients with
advanced hyperparathyroidism, and parathyroid interventions
such as parathyroidectomy are often required (38). Thus,
identifying a patient with refractory hyperparathyroidism is
a major problem.
Recently, pathophysiological aspects of parathyroid hyper￾plasia have been extensively elucidated (39, 40). In the in￾itial stage of CKD, several mitogenic stimuli, such as phos￾phorus load and reduced production of calcitriol, induce hy￾pertrophy and proliferation of parathyroid cells (diffuse hy￾perplasia). Some cells in the parathyroid with diffuse hyper￾plasia, especially those exhibiting reduction of vitamin D re￾ceptor (VDR) and calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), prolif￾erate vigorously and become encapsulated (nodular hyper￾plasia). It has been well recognized that cells in nodular hy￾perplasia have reduced numbers of VDR and CaSR, thus
usually refractory to medical therapies (41, 42). Develop￾ment of nodular hyperplasia has been most efficiently diag￾nosed by ultrasonography, and 0.5 cm3 or 1 cm in diameter
has been considered to be the critical size (43). Hence, di￾alysis patients with severe hyperparathyroidism and such
large parathyroid gland(s) should undergo parathyroid inter￾vention if they do not respond to a short course of medical
intervention (Fig. 2) (44).
Parathyroid intervention
Parathyroid intervention, i.e., surgical parathyroidectomy
and direct injection therapy, should be indicated for refrac￾tory hyperparathyroidism associated with nodular hyperpla￾sia. There are three surgical approaches: total parathyroidec￾tomy with or without autotransplantation, subtotal parathy￾roidectomy, and minimally invasive surgery (45, 46). In gen￾eral, total parathyroidectomy with forearm autograft is pre￾ferred for secondary hyperparathyroidism, especially in pa￾tients who require long-term hemodialysis, because a recur￾rent, enlarged autograft can easily be removed from the
forearm (45). Minimally invasive surgery may be effective
and less invasive in patients with one solitary radioactive
nodule (46). Direct injection therapies, such as percutaneous
ethanol injection therapy (PEIT), percutaneous calcitriol in￾jection therapy (PCIT), and percutaneous maxacalcitol injec￾tion therapy (PMIT) are also effective treatments for refrac￾tory hyperparathyroidism (47-50). The main difference be￾tween parathyroidectomy and direct injection therapy is the
selection of the target glands. In total parathyroidectomy
with autograft, all glands are surgically removed and frag￾ments from the smallest gland are transplanted in the fore￾arm. In direct injection therapy, an enlarged gland with
nodular hyperplasia is selectively infiltrated by ethanol or
calcitriol (analogs), and other glands with diffuse hyperpla￾sia are treated with medical therapy. The appropriate dose of
calcitriol or its analogs must be used soon after direct injec￾tion therapy (51). In a recent clinical study, patients with
one hyperplastic gland responded well to PEIT with respect
to efficacy rate, remission period, and risk of relapse (52).
As recommended by the JSDT guidelines, a patient with
one enlarged gland is the best indication for PEIT (3, 4).
The selection of the optimal method for parathyroid inter￾vention should be determined by the number and location of
enlarged glands, as well as the presence of ectopic glands.

Calcimimetic agents
Calcimimetic agents, such as cinacalcet hydrochloride,
have been developed for the control of hyperparathyroidism
in patients with CKD. These agents enhance the sensitivity
of the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors, thereby reduc￾ing levels of PTH, serum calcium and phosphorus, and
calcium-phosphorus product (53). Cinacalcet therapy is also
favorable to meet the practice guidelines. The combined data
from three large randomized, placebo-controlled studies
showed that treatment with cinacalcet in combination with
conventional therapy, led to better achievement of the K/
DOQI recommended target ranges (54). In Japan, a recent
clinical study showed the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet
therapy, even in patients with a longer average dialysis vin￾tage (55). A post hoc analysis of the combined data from
four similarly designed clinical trials showed that cinacalcet
treatment significantly decreased the risks of parathyroidec￾tomy, fracture, and cardiovascular hospitalization (56). It re￾mains, however, to be elucidated whether or not calcimimet￾ics can effectively control hyperparathyroidism in patients
with nodular hyperplasia (57). Moreover, the economic im￾pact of these expensive agents should be considered, espe￾cially in comparison with parathyroidectomy (58). Further
investigation is required to elucidate these issues and estab￾lish the clinical significance of cinacalcet therapy in patients
with CKD.
Possible Beneficial Effect of Vitamin D
Therapy on Survival
Several clinical data uncovered CKD as a risk factor for
vitamin D deficiency and current recommendations from K/
DOQI emphasize the need to correct this deficiency by ad￾ministration of a vitamin D preparation such as ergocalcif￾erol. As 1-hydroxylase activity is impaired in CKD, acti￾vated vitamin D offers theoretical advantages and has been
prescribed to dialysis patients. Recently, a retrospective
analysis of hemodialysis patients reported that the mortality
was lower among those treated with paricalcitol, a selective
activator of VDR, compared to calcitriol (59). Since then,
several investigators have speculated that calcitriol or its
analogs may reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
in patients with CKD, especially dialysis patients. The
mechanism of such an effect is not known, but one hypothe￾sis suggests that calcitriol may have non-classical direct ef￾fects on the cardiovascular system (60). However, the effect
of correction of calcitriol deficiency on cardiovascular mor￾tality is not evident due to the retrospective nature of previ￾ous studies and the potential for confounding by unknown
factors. Indeed, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis
revealed that the evidence does not support the widespread
use of calcitriol (analogs) in treatment of CKD (61). By
contrast, a recent prospective analysis of case-control data
indicated that incident dialysis patients who received parical￾citol had a significant survival benefit during the first 90
days of dialysis, compared with those who did not receive
calcitriol or its analogs (62). Further detailed studies are re￾quired to validate the beneficial effect of selective VDR acti￾vators in CKD patients.
Conclusions
Disturbance in mineral and bone metabolism is one of the
most important causes of increased cardiovascular mortality
in CKD. According to recent clinical guidelines, including
those released by the JSDT, the control of parathyroid func￾tion in CKD patients should be achieved without the risk of

vascular calcification. If mineral and bone abnormalities
cannot be controlled with medical treatment, parathyroid in￾tervention should be indicated to avoid prolonged and even
potentially harmful medical therapy. Novel therapeutic tools,
such as sevelamer hydrochloride, calcitriol analogs, and ci￾nacalcet hydrochloride, have been introduced in the clinical
setting in Japan. These new agents are promising, but fur￾ther clinical research is required to harmonize these thera￾peutic modalities and to amend the current clinical guide￾lines.
