Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide with 5.8 million deaths occurring yearly. 
Almost 40% of trauma deaths are due to bleeding and occur in the first few hours 
after injury. Of the remaining severely injured patients up to 25% develop a dysregulated 
immune response leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Despite 
improvements in trauma care, the morbidity and mortality of this condition remains very 
high. Massive traumatic injury can overwhelm endogenous homeostatic mechanisms 
even with prompt treatment. The underlying mechanisms driving MODS are also not 
fully elucidated. As a result, successful therapies for trauma-related MODS are lacking. 
Trauma causes tissue damage that releases a large number of endogenous damage￾associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Mitochondrial DAMPs released in trauma, such 
as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), could help to explain part of the immune response in 
trauma given the structural similarities between mitochondria and bacteria. MtDNA, like 
bacterial DNA, contains an abundance of highly stimulatory unmethylated CpG DNA 
motifs that signal through toll-like receptor-9 to produce inflammation. MtDNA has been 
shown to be highly damaging when injected into healthy animals causing acute organ 
injury to develop. Elevated circulating levels of mtDNA have been reported in trauma 
patients but an association with clinically meaningful outcomes has not been established 
in a large cohort. We aimed to determine whether mtDNA released after clinical trauma 
hemorrhage is sufficient for the development of MODS. Secondly, we aimed to determine 
the extent of mtDNA release with varying degrees of tissue injury and hemorrhagic shock 
in a clinically relevant rodent model. Our final aim was to determine whether neutralizing 
mtDNA with the nucleic acid scavenging polymer, hexadimethrine bromide (HDMBr), at a 
clinically relevant time point in vivo would reduce the severity of organ injury in this model. 
Conclusions: We have shown that the release of mtDNA is sufficient for the development 
of multiple organ injury. MtDNA concentrations likely peak at different points in the early

postinjury phase dependent on the degree of isolated trauma vs combined trauma and 
hemorrhagic shock. HDMBr scavenging of circulating mtDNA (and nuclear DNA, nDNA) 
is associated with rescue from severe multiple organ injury in the animal model. This 
suggests that HDMBr could have utility in rescue from human trauma-induced MODS.

INTRODUCTION
According to the latest data from the World Health Organization 
(1), trauma accounts for 10% of deaths and 16% of disabilities 
worldwide. Critically injured patients who survive their initial 
resuscitative phase are at a high risk of developing multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (2). Isolated overwhelming 
tissue injury can lead to MODS but more commonly there is a 
combination of tissue injury and hemorrhagic shock. Half of 
MODS cases occur within 3 days post injury (3). The develop￾ment of MODS is associated with complications such as sepsis, 
poor outcomes including death and high-resource utilization and 
health-care costs (4).
Traumatic injury can lead to a range of cellular injury including 
physical destruction, cell stress and frank necrosis, all of which 
can lead to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs) into the extracellular and vascular compartments 
(5–7). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has recently been identi￾fied as a DAMP and a potential important activator of the innate 
immune response to trauma (8). A number of diverse nucleic 
acid scavenging polymers (NASPs) have recently been evaluated 
in vitro and in vivo (9). Hexadimethrine bromide (HDMBr) is a 
NASP that has been shown to prevent the activation of endosomal 
toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a CpG DNA dependent toxic shock 
murine model and improve survival (10). If mtDNA is critical to 
the development of MODS, then the administration of a nucleic 
acid scavenging agent such as HDMBr may be a therapeutic 
opportunity in critically injured trauma patients.
The overall objective of this study was to understand the 
association of mtDNA release in trauma with the development 
of MODS and its potential for therapeutic modulation. We first 
aimed to determine whether mtDNA released after clinical 
trauma hemorrhage is sufficient for the development of MODS. 
We then aimed to determine the extent of mtDNA release with 
varying degrees of tissue injury and hemorrhagic shock in a 
clinically relevant rodent model. Our final aim was to determine 
whether neutralizing mtDNA with the NASP, HDMBr, at a 
clinically relevant time point in vivo would reduce the severity of 
organ injury in this model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Study
The Royal London Hospital (RLH) is a busy, urban Major 
Trauma Centre and home to The London Air Ambulance. 
Trauma research is conducted at the RLH by The Barts Centre 
for Trauma Sciences (C4TS), Queen Mary University, London, 
who have been recruiting to a prospective, observational cohort 
study called the Activation of Coagulation and Inflammation in 
Trauma 2 (ACIT2) since 2008, to investigate the host response to 
traumatic injury.
Trauma patients are recruited on admission to the emergency 
department if they present within 2  h of injury. Blood samples 
are drawn on admission, 24 (±1 h) and 72 h and participants are 
seen daily until death or discharge. Written consent is obtained 
from all subjects although, if incapacitated, temporary consent 
can initially be obtained from a legally appointed representative 
(LAR). The study has approval from the National Health Service 
Research Ethics committee (REC): 07/Q0603/29. At the time of 
this clinical study, 367 patients had been enrolled in to ACIT2. 
From this biobank, 140 patients were selected for mtDNA meas￾urement. The injury profile of the cohort was characterized using 
categories of Injury Severity Score (ISS) 0–4, 5–15, 16–25, and >25 
and base deficit (BD) on admission −2 to 2, 2–6, and >6. Patients 
were randomly selected from each category, to achieve a balanced 
population for study. Control patients were defined as ISS 0–4 and 
no shock (BD −2 to 2 mEq/l). Therefore, our controls were part of 
the overall cohort and represent very minimally injured patients as 
opposed to healthy uninjured controls. MODS was defined using 
the Sequential Organ Failure Score (SOFA) as a score of ≥5 on at 
least 2 consecutive days, 48 h, or more following admission. One 
set of blank readings was subsequently excluded from analysis.
Animal Study
Ethics Statement
All experiments were carried out using male Wistar rats (Charles 
River, UK) weighing between 280 and 350 g. Animals received a 
standard diet and free access to water during a 7-day adaptation 
period after transport into the laboratory from the supplier. This 
was performed in accordance with Home Office Guidance in the 
Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and 
the Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals published 
by the American Physiological Society.
Anesthesia
All animals were anesthetized using intraperitoneal (i.p.) injec￾tions of sodium thiopentone, a barbiturate anesthetic agent, at 
a dose of 120 mg/kg (Merial Animal Health, UK). Small supp￾lementary injections of thiopentone were administered intrave￾nously during the course of the experiment as required.
Temperature Control
Animals were then placed supine onto a thermostatically con￾trolled heating mat (Harvard Apparatus, UK). Body temperature 
was maintained at 38 ± 1°C with a temperature feedback via a 
rectal temperature probe connected to the homeothermic blanket.

Desk lamps provided extra heat as required during particularly 
hypothermic phases such as controlled hemorrhage.
Airway and Ventilation
Airway patency and spontaneous respiration were facilitated by a 
tracheotomy and insertion of 2-cm length of polyethylene tubing 
(ID 1.67 mm, Portex, UK), approximately 5 mm into the trachea 
where it was secured with nylon sutures.
Arterial Catheterization
The left carotid artery was cannulated under direct vision with 
PE50 tubing (ID 0.58 mm, Portex, UK) and attached to a pres￾sure transducer (AD Instruments, UK) and connected to a data 
acquisition system (Powerlab 8/35, AD Instruments, UK) for the 
measurement of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart 
rate (HR). The arterial catheter was primed with heparinized 
saline at a concentration of 50 IU/ml to prevent clot formation.
Venous Catheterization
The right jugular vein was cannulated under direct vision with 
PE25 tubing (ID 0.40 mm, Portex, UK) for the administration of 
fluid, blood or therapeutic agent. After baseline, instrumentation 
was completed, and animals were allowed to stabilize for 15 min 
before the next phase commenced.
Induced Traumatic Injury
1. Closed lower limb midshaft fractures. One or both tibias and 
fibulas were fractured manually, taking care not to break the 
overlying skin and tissue.
2. A 4-cm midline laparotomy. After hair removal and skin 
sterilization with 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes (Molnlycke 
Healthcare, UK), a midline incision was made without bowel 
manipulation. The wound was closed within 5  min in one 
layer with interrupted surgical 4/0 sutures (Prolene, Ethicon, 
UK). Highly standardized elements of both the trauma and 
hemorrhage phases were required to minimize variation 
and to allow the smallest number of animals to be used. 
Intentional or accidental bowel manipulation during laparot￾omy, for example, has been suggested as a driver for increased 
inflammation, remote organ injury and increased model 
severity (11, 12).
3. Bilateral lower limb muscle crush. Hemostatic forceps were 
applied to the upper musculature of each lower limb and 
clamped down maximally for 10 s.
4. Limb fracture hematoma, i.p. hematoma and laparotomy 
wound hematoma were excluded at necropsy.
Hemorrhagic Shock Protocol
During right-sided jugular vein catheterization, PE 25 tubing 
was advanced gently into the right heart such that blood could be 
freely aspirated. Jugular catheter tip positioning was confirmed 
at necropsy. Hemorrhagic shock was induced via bleeding from 
the jugular catheter to achieve an MAP of 35 ± 5 mmHg within 
10  min, at a rate no faster than 1  ml/min. Hemorrhage was 
continued for 20–35 min until 20–30% of the estimated blood 
volume had been removed. No resuscitation was delivered to the 
animal subsequently. The carotid arterial catheter was primed 
with a reduced concentration of heparinized saline (25 IU/ml) 
to maintain patency. If the MAP signal indicated a problem with 
catheter patency, every attempt was made to bleed back the cath￾eter to remove any potential heparinized saline before flushing 
with plain saline of 20 µl (the dead space of a 150-mm length of 
PE25 tubing), then reconnecting to the heparinized saline system 
and finally, re-priming with 20-µl heparinized saline. Thus, sys￾temic administration of heparin was minimized.
Therapeutic Agent Administration
At 15 min after the hemorrhage phase was completed, animals 
received either an intravenous bolus of saline 250 µl (0.9% NaCl, 
Baxter Healthcare, UK) or the NASP study drug (HDMBr, Sigma, 
UK) at a concentration of 1–4 mg/kg, dissolved in saline of 250 µl, 
both administered for 10 min.
Point of Care Tests
Lactate Measurement
A 20-µl blood sample was withdrawn and used for lactate meas￾urement (Accutrend, Roche, UK).
Blood Gas Analysis
A 100-µl blood sample was aspirated into a heparin-coated (hepa￾rin fully expelled) syringe for blood gas analysis (Radiometer, UK).
Plasma Preparation
Terminal blood was collected into EDTA containing tubes 
(3  ×  1.3  ml, Sarstedt, UK), gently inverted three times and 
immediately centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min at room temperature 
to remove the platelet-rich fraction. The plasma layer was then 
aspirated taking care not to disturb the cellular fraction and again 
centrifuged at 3,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and then again at 3,000 g
for 15 min at 4°C.
Biochemical Organ Function Analysis
Plasma samples were sent to a contract laboratory (Vetlab Services, 
Sussex, UK) for analysis within 24 h for urea, creatinine, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
and creatine kinase (CK). Renal dysfunction was quantified by 
the rise in urea (a marker of pre-renal renal impairment and/
or increased catabolism) and creatinine (a marker of impaired 
glomerular filtration rate) (13). Liver injury was quantified by a 
rise in ALT (a specific marker of parenchymal damage) and also 
in AST (a nonspecific marker of liver injury, which is also raised 
in myocardial, renal and muscle necrosis) (14). Muscle injury was 
quantified by a rise in CK, which is also elevated in cardiac muscle 
injury and brain injury (15).
Lung Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Activity
Myeloperoxidase activity, used as an indicator of leukocyte accu￾mulation into the lung, was determined as previously described 
(16). Briefly, samples were homogenized and centrifuged for 
30 min at 13,000 g at 4°C. An aliquot of the supernatant was then 
allowed to react with a solution of 1.6 mM tetramethylbenzidine 
and 0.1 mM H2O2. The rate of change in absorbance was measured 
spectrophotometrically at 460 nm. MPO activity was defined as 
the quantity of enzyme degrading 1 µmol of peroxide per min at

37°C and was expressed in milliunits per gram of wet tissue. All 
compounds were from Sigma, MO, USA.
Plasma and Lung Cytokine Analysis
Commercial colorimetric rat ELISA kits for the measurement of 
plasma IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were used (R&D Systems, UK). 
Rat HMGB1 (MyBioSource, USA) and TFAM (Cusabio, Japan) 
ELISA kits were also used. Plasma dilutions were none (neat) for 
all ELISA kits except IL-6 (1:2 dilution). Lung homogenates were 
tested for IL-6 concentration using a rat ELISA kit (Sigma, UK).
Extraction of Free Circulating DNA in Cell-Free 
Plasma
DNA was extracted from cell-free EDTA plasma with the QIAamp 
Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, UK). Frozen plasma was thawed over ice, 
vortexed for 5 s and then centrifuged at 1,600 g for 5 s. Qiagen 
Protease or proteinase K was used. DNA was eluted into 60-µl 
sterile water. DNA purity and yield was examined with the spec￾trophotometer (Nanodrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK).
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to 
Measure Plasma Circulating mtDNA and nDNA
Primers for three rat mtDNA genes and one nDNA gene 
were used (Invitrogen, UK): Cytochrome B (Cyt B) TCCACTTC 
ATCCTCCCATTC (Forward) CTGCGTCGGAGTTTAATCCT 
(Reverse); Cytochrome C oxidase subunit III (Cyto C III) 
ACATACCAAGGCCACCAAC (Forward) CAGAAAAATCCG 
GCAAAGAA (Reverse); NADH dehydrogenase CAATACCC 
CACCCCCTTATC (Forward) GAGGCTCATCCCGATCATAG 
(Reverse); Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 
GAAATCCCCTGGAGCTCTGT (Forward) CTGGCACCAGAT 
GAAATGTG (Reverse). GAPDH is a nuclear gene that is exp￾ressed at high levels in most tissues and cells, and is considered a 
housekeeping gene. GAPDH is commonly used as a loading con￾trol for western blot and as a control for RT-PCR (17). However, 
this study was also concerned with nDNA concentrations per se. 
All primer sequences were specific for their targets and had no 
similarity with bacterial sequences on BLAST analysis. PCR 
reaction volume was 20 µl (containing 6-µl DNA) using SYBR 
Green Mastermix (Life Technologies, UK) and primers in a final 
concentration of 1.0 µM. The Rotorgene 6000 RT-PCR machine 
was used (ex-Corbett Life Science, currently Qiagen, UK) to per￾form 40 cycle PCR comprising 10 s hold at 95°C, 30 s annealing at 
55°C, and 30-s extension at 72°C. Data analysis was performed on 
Corbett Life Science proprietary software. Absolute quantification 
of mtDNA was performed using serial dilutions of pure mtDNA 
extracted from rat liver to generate standard curves. NDNA was 
quantified using 1/Ct values relative to the change in sham levels.
Preparation of Pure mtDNA From Rat Liver
Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver either with the use of 
the Mitochondrial Isolation Kit (Sigma, UK). Liver was prepared 
in a sterile manner at 4°C. Liver was homogenized at 4°C with a 
3-ml volume electric homogenizer for 30 s. DNA was extracted 
using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, UK) using proteinase 
K. Yield and purity were assessed spectrophotometrically.
Bacterial 16S rRNA PCR Screening of Plasma 
and Pure mtDNA Fractions
Bacterial screening of animal cell-free plasma and pure mtDNA 
fractions was performed using RT-PCR against bacterial 16S 
rRNA. NADK primers specific for 16S were used (Invitrogen, UK) 
and NADK probe modified with FAM-BHQ (black hole quencher) 
and shrimp nuclease (Affymetrix, UK) to remove contaminating 
bacteria present in reagents. PCR reaction volume was 10 µl com￾prising 2.9-µl molecular grade water (Ambion, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, UK), 5-µl SSOFAST probe supermix (Bio-Rad, UK), 
0.8-µl primers (F + R), 10-µM concentration, 0.2-µl probe, and 
0.1-µl shrimp nuclease. CFX 96 RT-PCR machine with C1000 
thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, UK) used. 40 cycles: 2 min at 95°C, 10 s 
at 61.4°C, 5 s at 95°C. Enterococcus faecalis standards were serially 
diluted 1:10 from 200 ng/µl to 20 fg/μl.
NASP Toxicity Experiments
Healthy controls were anesthetized and instrumented as 
described previously. NASP 2 or 4 mg/kg in 250-µl saline of 0.9% 
total volume was intravenously injected into animals for 10 min. 
Plasma and organs were sampled at 6 h.
Pure mtDNA Challenge in Healthy Animals
Healthy controls were anesthetized and instrumented as described 
previously. Pretreatment with NASP 2  mg/kg was followed by 
intravenous injection of pure mtDNA from 5% liver by weight 
(Sigma, UK). Pure mtDNA from either 3 or 5% liver was also 
intravenously injected alone into healthy instrumented animals. 
Plasma and organs were sampled at 6 h.
Lung Tissue Western Blot Analysis
The analysis was performed in association with Prof. Massimo 
Collino, Department of Drug Science and Technology, Turin 
University, Italy. Western blots were carried out as previously 
described (18). Proteins were separated by 8% sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to poly￾vinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then incubated with 
primary antibodies [rabbit anti-NF-κB p65, rabbit anti-STAT-3, and 
rabbit anti-phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcrip￾tion (STAT)-3]. Blots were then incubated with a secondary antibody 
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (dilution 1:10,000) 
and developed using the ECL detection system. The immunoreac￾tive bands were visualized by autoradiography and the density of 
the bands was evaluated densitometrically using Gel Pro®Analyzer 
4.5, 2000 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). 
The membranes were stripped and incubated with β-actin 
monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:5,000) and subsequently with 
an anti-mouse antibody (dilution 1:10,000) to assess gel-loading 
homogeneity. Unless otherwise stated, all compounds were pur￾chased from the Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA. The BCA Protein Assay 
kit and SuperBlock blocking buffer were from Pierce Biotechnology 
(IL, USA). Antibodies were from New England Biolabs, UK. 
Luminol ECL was from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK).
Lung Histological Analysis
The rat lung was fixed in 10% formalin (Sigma) for 24 h, followed 
by embedment and 6-µm sectioning for hematoxylin & eosin

(H&E) staining. Samples were dehydrated using graded ethanol, 
embedded in paraffin wax, and cut into sections using a Leica 
rotary microtome (thickness, 6 µm). Sections were deparaffinized 
with xylene, stained with Gills hematoxylin, and washed. Sections 
were then subsequently counterstained with 1% eosin, dehydrated 
with ethanol, and cleared with Neo-Clear (Darmstadt, Germany) 
before mounting using HistoMount (Atlanta, GA, USA). Sections 
were analyzed using a Leica DM2000 upright microscope (Wetzlar, 
Germany). The entire H&E-stained section was evaluated at low 
magnification (5× objective) for inflammatory cell infiltration. A 
4-point scoring scale of cell infiltration was used to determine the 
grade of lung inflammation: 0 = normal; 1 = mild; 2 = intermediate; 
3 = severe (19). Features examined were inflammatory cell infiltra￾tion, pulmonary congestion, and thickening of the alveolar septa. 
A total of 10 fields were evaluated randomly for each sample. The 
score for each group was the average score for all samples in the 
group. Quantitative analysis was performed in a blinded way.
Lung Immunohistochemistry Analysis
Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized with histo-clear/
ethanol and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was made in sodium 
citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) at a sub-boiling temperature for 
10 min, followed by 30-min cooling on bench top. After incuba￾tion with 3% hydrogen peroxide to remove endogenous peroxi￾dase activity, the slides were washed with PBS and blocked with 
5% normal serum for 1 h. The sections were immunostained with 
anti-rat cleaved caspase-3 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, 
Danvers, MA, USA) and anti-rat nitrotyrosine (1:1,000, EMD 
Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) at 4°C overnight. After wash￾ing with PBST, the slides were incubated with a biotinylated 
secondary antibody (Vector labs, Burlingame, CA, USA), fol￾lowed by streptavidin-HRP (Vector labs). The bound antibodies 
were developed by ImmPACT™ DAB peroxidase substrate kit 
(Vector labs). The cleaved caspase-3+ cell number was quantified 
by counting positively stained cells in 20 randomly selected fields 
under 60× objective.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 
version 6. Parametric data were analyzed using Student’s t-test; 
multiple groups using ANOVA with Dunnett’s/Tukey’s compari￾sons as appropriate. Non-parametric data were analyzed using 
chi-squared tests. Mean values with SEM were quoted throughout 
unless otherwise stated.
RESULTS
Human Study
This human study examined mtDNA levels in 139 trauma 
patients, and demonstrated that patients who developed MODS 
had significantly higher concentrations of mtDNA in their circu￾lation at only 2 h following injury.
The human cohort comprised Controls (n = 16), No MODS 
(n = 85) and MODS (n = 27), and 11 patients who died within 
48 h. The demographics are reported in Table S1 in Supplementary 
Material. MODS patients had significantly higher ISS and BD, 
reflecting a higher injury burden and a higher associated morta￾lity (no MODS 0% vs MODS 22%, p < 0.05). Acute lung injury 
was the dominant organ dysfunction component (93% of all 
cases of MODS at 48  h). Secondary adverse outcomes such as 
the development of infection, the length of stay, and mortality 
were also higher in the MODS group. Patients who developed 
MODS had significantly higher concentrations of mtDNA in 
their blood compared to patients who did not develop MODS 
(Figure  1A). Control patients had very low concentrations of 
circulating mtDNA. Isolated tissue injury, without shock, led to 
a dose-dependent increase in mtDNA release (Figure 1B). The 
combination of severe shock and severe trauma resulted in a 
substantial rise in circulating mtDNA. These data suggest that 
mtDNA release into the circulation occurs as a result of mechani￾cal tissue injury and cellular injury, related to hypoperfusion. The 
presence of MODS was also associated with a rise in plasma IL-6 
concentration (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). The influ￾ence of bacterial components as a MODS stimulus was excluded 
using PCR analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA in patient plasma, 
which demonstrated negligible concentrations (data not shown).
Animal Study
Rodents were subjected to increasing degrees of traumatic injury 
and shock. As can be seen in Figure  2, the development of 
shock resulted in varying degrees of organ injury. The addition 
of traumatic injury to hemorrhagic shock resulted in a more 
severe organ injury. Traumatic injury by itself did not result in 
the development of severe organ injury in these models and was 
associated with 100% experimental survival. Lung MPO was 
the most sensitive marker of increasing traumatic injury and/or 
shock, followed by urea/creatinine and then derangement of liver 
function tests (Spearman correlation analysis, data not shown). 
This correlates with the progression of organ dysfunction found 
in clinical postinjury MODS described in the literature (20) as 
well as in our clinical series of 139 patients.
Plasma DNA Levels vs Degree of Trauma and Shock
As can be seen in Figure 3, both mtDNA and nDNA concentra￾tions broadly rose with increasing severity of injury. However, 
important differences were evident. mtDNA levels exhibited 
a dose-dependent increase with increasing isolated traumatic 
injury, whereas nDNA did not. Plasma nDNA concentrations were 
increased significantly with 30% hemorrhagic shock, whereas 
mtDNA concentrations were not. With severe combined trauma 
and shock both concentrations were significantly raised with 
respect to sham levels: 10- and 50-fold for mtDNA and nDNA, 
respectively. Interestingly, the 0- to 10-ng/ml range for mtDNA 
concentration found in this study correlates well with other stud￾ies of clinical trauma (21–23). Similar magnitude increases in 
nDNA levels have also been reported by others (24).
A further large correlation analysis including all measured 
parameters of inflammation, organ dysfunction and DNA 
concentrations was then carried out (Table S2 in Supplementary 
Material). MtDNA and nDNA were only moderately correlated 
to each other (p < 0.01), which lead to some divergent findings in 
this analysis. Interestingly, of all the variables measured (except 

Figure 1 | (A) (left) Plasma mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) concentration at 2 h from injury is associated with the development of multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome (MODS) in injured trauma patients. Injured patients who developed MODS (n = 27) had higher concentrations of mtDNA (as measured by cytochrome B

lung IL-6), mtDNA was the most highly correlated to lung MPO 
levels (p <  0.001). NDNA, by contrast, was weakly correlated 
with lung MPO (p = 0.051). MtDNA was highly correlated with 
urea concentrations (p < 0.0001) and moderately correlated with 
plasma IL-6 and the other organ function scores (p <0.05 to 
<0.01). NDNA, on the other hand, was highly correlated with 
plasma IL-6 and the non-lung organ injury markers (p < 0.0001). 
Although this does not confirm causation, it supports a large 
body of work suggesting that lung injury is particularly driven 
by mtDNA concentrations rather than nDNA (8, 23, 25–30). By 
contrast, these studies have shown nDNA to be immunologically 
inert. The high expression of CpG repeats present in mtDNA and 
relative CpG suppression in nDNA also adds weight to this view. 
There is some doubt, however, as to the biological plausibility 
of injections of pure mtDNA or nDNA as a relevant traumatic 
insult. Although tempting to conclude that circulating nDNA in 
trauma is inert, this view downplays a significant body of work 
that suggests nDNA is inflammogenic in certain circumstances, 
most evident in studies of chronic autoimmune diseases (31–33). 
This is particularly evident when the nDNA is fragmented (as 
would be the case as a product of cellular necrosis), when it is 
present in a double-stranded form and when it is associated with 
histones in the form of nucleosomes (34). MtDNA probably has 
a greater inflammatory potential with less purity (35), when 
derived as a synthetic PCR product (25, 27) when co-present with 
other mitochondrial molecules such as TFAM or formyl peptides 
(36, 37), such as when derived from whole mitochondria (8) or 
when administered in high concentrations (38). These factors are 
not readily simulated in experimental conditions. In summary, 
these results suggest that the mechanisms of release of nDNA and 
mtDNA are different in trauma hemorrhage. Clinically, elevated 
nDNA levels may simply be reflective of general illness severity, 
hypoperfusion status or be a marker of the release of other DAMPs 
(24), whereas mtDNA release appears to be more closely related to 
cell disruption and necrosis, at least in the early postinjury phase.
Time Course of Plasma DNA Levels in Trauma 
Hemorrhage
The time course of plasma DNA levels appears to depend on the 
degree of trauma and/or shock sustained. Isolated trauma gener￾ates a disproportionate rise in mtDNA within 2  h post injury 
[unpublished data from our group, also reported by Ref. (21, 39)].
The peak of mtDNA post-combined trauma hemorrhage 
clinically has been found to occur within the first 24 h of injury

and levels remained elevated for a week in several studies (24, 
39–41). This concurs with an animal study which showed that 
resuscitated trauma hemorrhage resulted in a peak of mtDNA at 
around 24 h as well (42). Delayed rises in mtDNA at 3–5 days post 
injury have also been noted and attributed to NETosis (43, 44).
Circulating Nucleic Acid Concentration Is Decreased 
With NASP Treatment in T-HS
As can be seen in Figure 4, circulating plasma mtDNA at 6 h 
increased 10-fold in untreated trauma hemorrhage compared 
to sham controls. The use of NASP 1 mg/kg post injury resulted 
in a non-significant reduction in mtDNA (p =  0.06); NASP 
2  mg/kg caused a significant reduction in mtDNA by about 
50% (p =  0.015). Interestingly, NASP 4  mg/kg showed an 
approximately unchanged mtDNA concentration compared 
to controls. Figure  5 illustrates the corresponding changes 
in nDNA. Untreated severe trauma hemorrhage resulted in a 
50-fold rise in nDNA. NASP 1 mg/kg resulted in attenuation in 
nDNA levels to approximately 5-fold sham levels, followed by 
a 17- and 22-fold rise for NASP 2 and NASP 4 mg/kg groups, 

Figure 4 | A 6-h plasma mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), lung inflammation scores and systemic IL-6. Cell-free mtDNA was measured with real time polymerase chain 
reaction using cytochrome B as the target gene: Severe T-HS 25% resulted in an approximately eightfold increase in mtDNA compared to sham, 0.57 (±0.1) to 4.1 
(±0.6) ng/ml, p < 0.0001, t-test. The addition of nucleic acid scavenging polymer (NASP) (hexadimethrine bromide) 1 mg/kg post injury resulted in a non-significant 
trend toward reduced mtDNA, mean 2.46 (±0.46) ng/ml, p = 0.06. NASP 2 mg/kg reduced circulating plasma mtDNA by half to 2.2 (±0.36) ng/ml, * denotes 
p < 0.05. NASP 4 mg/kg resulted in an increased mean mtDNA 5.09 (±0.9) ng/ml relative to untreated T-HS 25%, p > 0.05. Lung MPO: untreated T-HS 25% 
showed a marked increase in lung MPO compared to shams, 140 (±0.5) vs 25.8 (±0.8) uU MPO/g, p < 0.0001. There was significant attenuation of lung MPO in 
the NASP 1 and 2 mg/kg groups, 49.4 (±0.4) and 61.9 (±0.9) uU MPO/g respectively, § denotes p < 0.0001, but not in the NASP 4 mg/kg group. Lung IL-6 
concentration was measured by ELISA: untreated T-HS 25% resulted in a significant increase in Lung IL-6 from sham levels, 74.9 (±6.5) vs 23.7 (±1.1) pg/mg 
protein, p < 0.0001. There was significant attenuation in lung IL-6 with all three doses used, 24.7 (±0.76), 34.2 (±5.5), and 41.3 (±2.3) pg/mg protein, respectively, § 
denotes p < 0.0001 vs untreated T-HS 25%. Systemic IL-6 concentration was measured by ELISA: There was a marked increase in plasma IL-6 in untreated T-HS 
compared to controls, 2,999 (±782) pg/ml vs 186 (±2) pg/ml, p < 0.0001. There was significant attenuation of IL-6 release with all three doses used: 373 (±51), 
1,299 (±298), and 738 (±69) pg/ml, respectively, † denotes p < 0.01 and § denotes p < 0.0001 vs untreated T-HS 25%, t-tests throughout. Mean values with SEM 
bars shown.

respectively. Lung MPO appears to be a very sensitive marker 
of lung injury that is responsive to higher doses of NASP per se, 
probably reflecting toxicity and cell necrosis at 4 mg/kg dosing 
(Figure 10). mtDNA release could be a result of this toxicity itself 
reflecting cellular oxidative stress and damage. Similar toxicity 
has been noted with other cationic agents (29, 45, 46). Bacterial 
contamination was excluded in all studies with the use of PCR 
targeting bacterial 16S rRNA (Figure S3 in Supplementary 
Material).
NASP Treatment Produces Broad 
Anti-Inflammatory Action at the Transcriptional 
Level in T-HS
IL-6 was the most consistently elevated cytokine measured in this 
study. Of note, other cytokines and DAMPs were measured at 6 h in 
this experiment including IL-1β, TNF-α, HMGB1, and TFAM but 
extremely low or undetectable levels were found in all groups (data 
not shown). IL-6 exerts its action via the signal transducer gp130 
leading to the activation of the STAT and MAPK cascades (47).

concentration relative to sham, p < 0.0001. Nucleic acid scavenging polymer (NASP) (hexadimethrine bromide) 1 mg/kg resulted in significant attenuation of this rise

TLR-9 is known to signal via Myd88 which then activates NF-κB 
signaling to produce a broad inflammatory phenotype (29). NF-κB 
is also a strong inducer of IL-6 (48). Western blot analysis of lung 
homogenates for phosphorylation of NF-κB and STAT-3 was 
performed (Figure 6). There was a marked attenuation of the phos￾phorylation of NF-κB to sham levels with both NASP 2 mg/kg and

NASP 4 mg/kg. With regard to STAT-3, NASP 2 mg/kg produced an 
attenuation of the phosphorylation to sham levels; NASP 4 mg/kg 
produced less but still significant attenuation. No loss of anti￾inflammatory action was noted at the higher dose of NASP used.
NASP Treatment Improves Lung Histological 
Appearance in T-HS
Trauma hemorrhagic shock leads to cellular stress, failure of 
mitophagy, and autophagy, increasing degrees of oxidative stress, 
translocation of mtDNA to the cytosol, and activation of apoptotic 
cell death pathways (49, 50). When the ischemia is prolonged 
and/or reperfusion injury supervenes, cellular necrosis occurs 
with resultant movement of mtDNA into the extracellular space. 
Apoptosis is known to be associated with the release of oxidized 
mtDNA into the cytosol, where it binds to the NLRP3 inflamma￾some causing local and systemic inflammation (51).
Immune cell infiltration, apoptotic cell death, and oxidative 
injury in lung tissue were assessed by the use of H&E, cleaved

caspase-3, and 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT) staining, respectively 
(Figures 7–9). There was a broad protective effect evident with 
all three stains with NASP use and evidence of a dose-dependent 
protective effect. Again, no loss of protection was noted at the 
highest dose of NASP used.
NASP Toxicity Study
De novo toxicity was evaluated by the injection of NASP 2 and 
NASP 4  mg/kg into healthy animals (Figure  10). Significant 
increases in lung MPO were noted with increasing doses of NASP 
compared to naïve animals. This is in keeping with the known and

predicted side effects of this agent given its charge chemistry and 
likely affinity for binding to pulmonary vascular endothelium. 
There was no evidence of significantly increased renal, liver or 
muscle injury with the higher NASP 4  mg/kg dose (p >  0.10, 
data not shown). The kidney has been noted to be particularly 
resistant to the inflammatory potential of mtDNA challenge in

both plasma and lung IL-6 concentrations, p < 0.01. Pretreatment of sham animals with NASP 2 mg/kg followed by injection of pure mtDNA extracted from 5% liver

injections. Mean values with SEM shown.

a previous study in mice and rats (27). There was a trend toward 
increased mtDNA concentrations with NASP 4 mg/kg (p = 0.06) 
and no significant increase in nDNA concentrations (Figure S2 
in Supplementary Material). Overall, this suggests possible cyto￾toxicity with this dose of NASP, which could potentially lead to a 
feedforward cycle of mtDNA-propagated inflammation.
mtDNA Challenge in Healthy Animals
Pure mtDNA extracted from rodent liver was injected into healthy 
animals and plasma and organs were sampled at 6 h (Figure 10). Two 
doses of mtDNA were chosen, 3 and 5% of liver by weight, because 
they had been used extensively by Hauser’s group and produced 
clinical range plasma mtDNA concentrations with subsequent 
organ injury (8, 42). The pure mtDNA extracts were proven to be 
infection-free with the use of PCR for bacterial 16S rRNA (data not 
shown). A dose-dependent increase in lung MPO was detected with 
an increasing dosage of mtDNA compared to shams. However, post 
treatment with NASP 2 mg/kg 30 min after mtDNA challenge failed 
to attenuate this rise in MPO. Similarly, pretreatment with NASP 
2 mg/kg 15 min before mtDNA challenge failed to attenuate the lung 
injury as measured by MPO. The reasons for the inability to rescue 
MPO induced lung injury are not clear but include extreme sensitivity

of the lung MPO test to measure inflammation, crude modeling 
of the clinical injury with a single bolus of mtDNA, and sus￾ceptibility of the animal lung to the toxicity of the treatment itself.
A small but significant rise in plasma IL-6 and lung IL-6 was 
evident with the 5% liver mtDNA dose (Figure 10). Other plasma 
organ injury markers were not elevated. However, pretreatment 
with NASP 2 mg/kg attenuated the rise in lung and plasma IL-6 
to sham levels.
Further histological examination of lungs from this experi￾ment using H&E, cleaved caspase-3 and 3-NT stains further 
confirmed that the injection of pure mtDNA into healthy ani￾mals caused moderately severe acute lung injury on histological 
appearances. NASP pretreatment was able to attenuate inflamma￾tory cellular infiltration, apoptotic cell death and oxidative cellular 
injury in lung tissue in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 11).
Other Plasma Organ Injury Markers
The results of this array of tests were more mixed (Figure 12). All 
three doses produced a similarly statistically reduced 6-h lactate 
compared to untreated T-HS animals. As the bleeding phase, 
injury phase and post mortem examinations (to exclude large limb 
hematomas or i.p. bleeding, for example) were similar in all groups, 
this improvement in lactate supports a broad cellular protective 
mechanism with NASP treatment. However, multiple organ pro￾tection was most consistently shown with NASP 2 mg/kg.
DISCUSSION
We have shown that the release of mtDNA is sufficient for the 
development of severe organ injury. HDMBr scavenging of 
circulating mtDNA (and nDNA) in an in vivo model of trauma

hemorrhage is associated with protection from severe organ 
injury. This suggests that HDMBr could also rescue patients from 
trauma-induced MODS.
Hexadimethrine bromide has previously been safely and 
extensively used as an antiheparin agent in cardiopulmonary 
bypass surgery in doses up to 5 mg/kg (52–61). Therefore, a safety 
profile exists clinically for HDMBr which could allow a feasible 
translation of its use as a NASP in trauma hemorrhage.
Overall, the results pertaining to acute lung injury and the 
use of NASP in T-HS suggest that HDMBr has definite lung 
protective properties, most convincingly at 1 and 2 mg/kg doses. 
Higher doses appear to elicit toxicity as evidenced by increased 
lung MPO concentrations and possibly higher plasma mtDNA 
levels. Polycationic compounds in general have been shown 
to accumulate in lung tissue in particular (29). However, this 
toxicity is neither demonstrated in the cytokine profile nor on 
histological examination of lungs from rats subjected to trauma 
hemorrhage and treated with HDMBr. The expected toxicity of 
cationic agents such as HDMBr would include plasma mem￾brane destabilization and apoptotic cell death signaling. These

features have not been demonstrated in this study in the con￾text of rescue from severe trauma hemorrhage induced injury. 
Clearly, there is a risk–benefit profile and therapeutic index 
to be established in further studies. The mechanistic mtDNA 
challenge experiments in HDMBr-pretreated rodents confirm 
that mtDNA is an important mediator in the pathogenesis 
of trauma hemorrhage induced lung injury and that mtDNA 
can be targeted by a NASP such as that used here. However, 
circulating nDNA is also reduced in these experiments, so an 
effect from nDNA cannot be fully excluded.
The ability of HDMBr to bind free plasma mtDNA could be 
a large part of its protective mechanism. This is also supported 
by recent studies in which NASPs were immobilized on micro￾spheres or incorporated into a nanofiber mesh and co-incubated 
with cells and CpG DNA to produce cellular protection (62, 63).
The exact nature of HDMBr–DNA interactions and their sub￾sequent cellular trafficking remains poorly elucidated. HDMBr 
is a nanoscale compound which has a well-recognized ability to 
condense DNA into nanocomplexes for delivery into cells (10). 
Its ability to disrupt plasma membranes and increase membrane 
permeability to itself and other molecules probably also plays a 
part in its cellular uptake (64). Despite being positively charged 
and still retaining most of this charge with the addition of cargo 
such as DNA, these nanomolecules are small enough to penetrate 
within cells. HDMBr has one of the smallest molecular weights 
in this class which probably aids its cellular entry, although no 
direct evidence exists for the internalization of HDMBr itself. 
These effects have been indirectly measured in the case of 
HDMBr–CpG interactions; CpG, in the presence of HDMBr 
treated cells, was seen to localize in the cytoplasm and the 
nucleus rather than co-localize at the endosomal compartment 
where TLR-9 is located (10). Other than entry via the (disrupted) 
plasma membrane, polycation–DNA complexes have been 
shown to be internalized via endocytic and phagocytic routes 
into vesicles where they then destabilize endosomal membranes 
or act as proton sponges, which then release the complexes into 
the cytoplasm. Lysosome perforation with lysosomal enzyme 
leakage, and mitochondrial permeabilization and mitochondri￾ally mediated apoptosis with resultant cytochrome c leakage 
have also been demonstrated (46, 65). Recent work has docu￾mented a direct polycationic toxicity due to its direct binding 
with Na+/K+-ATPase and its resultant impairment. This resulted 
in cell necrosis with the leakage of mtDNA and canonical TLR-9/
MyD88 dependent inflammation (29). A trend toward increased 
mtDNA concentrations was found in our NASP 4 mg/kg 
T-HS and toxicity experiments. Necroptosis, NETosis, and 
pyroptosis can also liberate mtDNA and may account for this 
rise (33).
Important limitations of this study should be noted. It was 
underpowered to detect differences in survival. The study, although 
randomized for the intervention, was not blinded; however, every 
effort was made to standardize the trauma and hemorrhage 
phases for each animal (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). 
Inspection of laparotomy wounds showed them all to be dry at 
the termination of the experiments, and post mortem examina￾tions of all animals excluded i.p. bleeding and limb hematomas 
related to fracture sites. However, an analysis of coagulation was 
not carried out; this would be useful given the unknown effects of 
HDMBr on the coagulation system when used in severe trauma 
hemorrhage. Finally, the experimental model was a short-term 
unresuscitated trauma hemorrhage rodent model which does 
not mirror the clinical course exactly. It does have a greater rel￾evance for the military or extreme pre-hospital scenario, where 
extraction times are prolonged. We identified heparin as a potent 
inhibitor of PCR in a previous model using shed heparinized 
blood resuscitation [unpublished data and also reported by oth￾ers (66)]. We initially felt that this would best represent modern 
damage-control resuscitation strategies, which includes the use 
of permissive hypotension, avoidance of large volumes of crystal￾loid or colloid, and the use of balanced ratios of blood products 
during massive blood transfusion. Further investigation of this 
compound using larger more relevant models, potentially with 
citrated blood resuscitation, would appear to be sensible next 
steps. Despite these limitations, mtDNA concentrations at 2  h 
post clinical injury and 6 h post injury in the animal appear to 
show a degree of similar predictive value for the development of 
MODS or severe organ dysfunction, respectively. Interestingly, 
Simmons et al. (40) reported on clinical trauma and found that 
baseline mtDNA concentrations (taken within 8  h of injury) 
were broadly comparable to subsequent levels taken over the first 
7 days as well and were highly associated with the development 
of MODS and mortality.
Further exploration of HDMBr and other members of this class 
of therapeutic agent is required to build on the proof of concept as 
explored in this paper. If successful, this could potentially provide 
a much-needed treatment in critically injured trauma patients.
ETHICS STATEMENT
Animal study: all experiments were carried out using male 
Wistar rats (Charles River, UK) weighing between 280 and 350 g. 
Animals received a standard diet and free access to water during 
a 7-day adaptation period after transport into the laboratory 
from the supplier. This was performed in accordance with Home 
Office Guidance in the Operation of the Animals (Scientific 
Procedures) Act 1986 and the Guiding Principles in the Care and 
Use of Animals published by the American Physiological Society 
and under the approval of Queen Mary University London. 
Human study: The Royal London Hospital (RLH) is a busy, urban 
Major Trauma Center and home to The London Air Ambulance. 
Trauma research is conducted at the RLH by The Barts Centre 
for Trauma Sciences (C4TS), Queen Mary University, London, 
who have been recruiting to a prospective, observational cohort 
study called the Activation of Coagulation and Inflammation in 
Trauma 2 (ACIT2) since 2008, to investigate the host response 
to traumatic injury. Trauma patients are recruited on admission 
to the emergency department if they present within 2 h of injury. 
Blood samples are drawn on admission, 24 (±1 h) and 72 h, and 
participants are seen daily until death or discharge. Written 
consent is obtained from all subjects although, if incapacitated, 
temporary consent can initially be obtained from a legally 
appointed representative (LAR). The study has approval from 
the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (REC): 
07/Q0603/29.
