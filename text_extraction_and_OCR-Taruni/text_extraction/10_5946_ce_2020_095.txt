INTRODUCTION
Despite continuing advances in surgical techniques, several 
complications in the biliary duct may occur after biliary sur￾gery. Benign biliary strictures (BBSs) develop in 15%–20% of 
patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) 
and in 19%–40% of those undergoing living-donor liver trans￾plantation (LDLT).1
 They also occur in 0.4%–0.6% of patients 
undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.2
 The cause of BBSs 
after liver transplantation may include hypertrophic chang￾es and ischemia due to intraoperative damage to the blood 
vessels supplying the bile duct. These strictures are difficult 
to manage because of the acutely angulated and tortuous bile 
duct at the anastomotic site.3-6 Although BBSs are the most 
common complication after biliary surgery, no standardized 
treatment has been established for their management.7-10
In the initial years of biliary operation, most bile duct com￾plications were treated surgically. However, surgical treatment 
has high rates of morbidity and mortality, and cannot be rec￾ommended for patients with inflammation in the bile duct.11
With the development of percutaneous transhepatic biliary 
drainage (PTBD) as an interventional radiologic procedure, 
recanalization of BBSs using an interventional technique has 
become possible. Insertion of multiple plastic stents (MPSs) or 
metal stents with or without balloon dilation through endo￾scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has also 
shown good results in the treatment of BBSs.5
 Recanalization 
of BBSs is possible with a high resolution rate owing to ad￾vances in nonsurgical methods such as endoscopic and percu￾taneous techniques. Therefore, nonsurgical treatment of BBSs 
after biliary surgery is safer and more effective than surgical 
treatment.9,12
However, endoscopic or percutaneous treatment cannot be 
successful when it is impossible to place a guidewire percuta￾neously or endoscopically through the BBS owing to complete 
obstruction and severe stricture in the bile duct. In these cases, 
patients should have an external PTBD catheter to drain bile, 
which places a major burden on the patient by lowering the

A number of different conditions can lead to a bile duct stricture. These strictures are particularly common after biliary operations, 
including living-donor liver transplantation. Endoscopic and percutaneous methods have high success rates in treating benign biliary 
strictures. However, these conventional methods are difficult to manage when a guidewire cannot be passed through areas of severe 
stenosis or complete obstruction. Magnetic compression anastomosis has emerged as an alternative nonsurgical treatment method 
to avoid the mortality and morbidity risks of reoperation. The feasibility and safety of magnetic compression anastomosis have been 
reported in several experimental and clinical studies in patients with biliobiliary and bilioenteric strictures. Magnetic compression 
anastomosis is a minimally traumatic and highly effective procedure, and represents a new paradigm for benign biliary strictures that 
are difficult to treat with conventional methods. Clin Endosc 2020;53:266-275

quality of life and conferring a high risk of infection.
Magnetic compression anastomosis (MCA) has been ap￾plied as a nonsurgical technique for reconstructing a refracto￾ry or completely obstructing BBS that cannot be resolved with 
conventional methods.13-24 MCA is a method of recanalizing 
the obstructed bile duct by inserting magnets at both ends of 
the stenosis, inducing necrosis of the stenotic lesion through 
the pulling force of magnets. In this review, the principle and 
clinical results of MCA will be discussed with respect to two 
types of strictures: biliobiliary strictures and bilioenteric stric￾tures. 
INDICATIONS FOR MCA
The development of endoscopic and percutaneous treat￾ments has enabled the resolution of BBSs.25-29 However, non￾surgical treatments cannot resolve severely narrowed or com￾pletely occluded bile ducts in which passage of a guidewire 
or dye is impossible. Accordingly, the indications for MCA 
are severe stenosis or complete obstruction of the bile duct 
that cannot be treated with usual endoscopic or percutaneous 
methods (Fig. 1).11,18,21-23,30-32
PRE-ASSESSMENT FOR SUCCESSFUL 
MCA
Pre-MCA assessment is needed to plan the approximation 
of magnets and to predict outcomes. Factors affecting the 
success of MCA include the length of the stricture, shape of 
the bile duct, power of the magnets, and axis of the bile duct. 
MCA may fail when the stricture is long and the bile duct is 
tapered or twisted in shape.22,23 The longer the stricture, the 
weaker the magnetic power between the two magnets. If the 
magnetic force is too weak, tissue necrosis due to magnetic 
compression cannot occur and a new fistula does not form. 
Therefore, exact evaluation of the length of the stricture is 
essential for a successful approximation of magnets before 
MCA. However, radiologic studies (computed tomography, 
ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancrea￾tography) cannot exactly assess the length of a stricture. Chol￾angiographic assessment of biliary ducts using ERCP or PTBD 
may be feasible; however, they are invasive procedures.
Evaluating the axis and shape of the bile duct is also sub￾stantial for the success of MCA. Even if the stricture is relative￾ly short, the magnet cannot fully reach the stricture if the bile 
duct is tapered and rotated. In tapered and rotated bile ducts, 
MCA can fail because the true distance between the two mag￾nets will be longer than the measured stricture.22 Moreover,

the axis of the bile ducts is important because it determines the 
direction of alignment of the two magnets. If the magnets are 
aligned parallel, MCA fails owing to weak magnetic power.22,23
Noninvasive radiologic tools have a limitation in identifying 
suitable MCA candidates because they cannot accurately eval￾uate the stricture length and shape, as well as the axis of the 
bile duct, for a successful MCA. Therefore, preassessments for 
MCA has limitations and the success of MCA could only be 
actually predicted while performing the procedure until now.
MCA PROCEDURE
The process of MCA is divided into four steps (Fig. 2): 
formation of the tract for magnet delivery, approximation of 
magnets, removal of the approximated magnets, and mainte￾nance and removal of the internal catheter.22,24 The common 
routes of magnet delivery are percutaneous and peroral. The 
percutaneous tract for the delivery of magnets is formed using 
the PTBD tract. The PTBD tract is sequentially dilated to 16 
Fr, and the PTBD catheter is changed to an 18 Fr sheath in the 
process of MCA approximation. This process allows the inser￾tion of magnets without difficulties and duct injury through 
the sheath during the movement of the magnets. The peroral 
route for magnet approximation is performed using ERCP. A 
retrieval fully covered self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) 
is inserted into the common bile duct (CBD) to deliver the 
magnet via the oral route after an endoscopic sphincterotomy.
A silk thread attached to one magnet is fixed to a polyp￾ectomy snare, and the magnet is moved to the stricture site 
through the PTBD tract. Another polypectomy snare is passed 
through the channel of an ERCP scope, and the other magnet 
is fixed in front of the scope. The magnet is moved to the anas￾tomosis site through the FCSEMS. This process is performed 

269

under controlled aseptic conditions with the same level of 
infection control as for the operating room, and no MCA pro￾cedure-related infection has been reported.
After one magnet is moved to the stricture via the 18-Fr 
sheath, the other magnet is applied to the stricture site through 
an FCSEMS in the CBD. After the placement of the two mag￾nets, the magnets are approximated through their attraction 
to each other. The distance between the two magnets is made 
shorter by pushing them using a balloon catheter through the 
PTBD and ERCP tracts. Radiologic cholangiography is per￾formed to confirm the approximation of the two magnets. Af￾ter confirming the approximation, the 18-Fr sheath is replaced 
with an indwelling 16-Fr PTBD catheter and the FCSEMS 
placed in the CBD is removed.
After the approximation, the two magnets compress the 
stricture tissue, leading to ischemic necrosis of the stricture tis￾sue. As the magnets gradually become closer to each other, the 
ischemic necrosis process accelerates and a new fistula is final￾ly formed. The magnets after full approximation can sponta￾neously migrate into the CBD or enteric tract through the new 
fistula. A plain abdominal radiograph is obtained at 2-week 
intervals for 6–8 weeks after the successful approximation of 
magnets to confirm the migration of the magnets through the 
fistula tract. If the magnets remain in the stricture site with 
close approximation after 10 weeks, they can be removed us￾ing percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS). The 
mean duration for a successful magnet removal after magnet 
approximation was reported to be 53.3 days (range, 9–181 
days) for biliobiliary strictures and 7–40 days for bilioenteric 
strictures.33,34 The factors for successful magnet removal in￾clude the distance between the two magnets, the magnetic 
power of the two magnets, and the histologic characteristics of 
the stricture site.
Recanalized fistula is confirmed endoscopically under fluo￾roscopy after magnet removal. The mean indwelling duration 
of the PTCS catheter or an FCSEMS to maintain the new fistu￾la tract is 4–6 months. The PTCS catheter and FCSEMS have 
exhibited similar safety and efficacy for fistula maintenance.35
However, the FCSEMS is more convenient for patients be￾cause the PTCS catheter has a longer indwelling duration and 
requires more number of replacements.
RESULTS OF MCA IN BILIOBILIARY 
STRICTURES
Post-living-donor liver transplantation strictures
BBSs are a relatively common complication of liver trans￾plantation. Extensive stripping of the blood vessels during the 
operation can cause ischemic injury4
 and hypertrophic change3
promotes biliobiliary anastomotic strictures.5
 Although the 
optimal strategy for BBSs has not been determined, nonsur￾gical approaches are more popular. The insertion of MPSs 
with or without balloon dilatation is currently the treatment of 
choice.36 The success rate of MPSs is approximately 70%–91% 
in patients with BBSs after deceased-donor liver transplan￾tation and 60%–100% in those with BBSs after LDLT.36-39
FCSEMS has a similar stricture resolution rate to MPS, but 
the number of ERCP sessions is fewer.1,40 However, MPS and 
FCSEMS insertion cannot be applied when a guidewire can￾not pass though the stricture.
The overall clinical success rate of MCA for biliobiliary 
strictures was reported to be 87.5%, and the recurrence rate 
was 7.1% (Table 1). The clinical success rates of MCA differ 
according to the etiology of the stricture and the treatment 
method in biliobiliary strictures.41-45 Although surgery-related 
strictures and strictures due to stones have high resolution 
rates with endoscopic treatment, idiopathic and chronic pan￾creatitis-related strictures respond poorly to endoscopic man￾agement.46 The clinical success rate of endoscopic treatment 
for biliobiliary strictures is 90% in postoperative strictures but 
only 65% in strictures due to chronic pancreatitis.46 Moreover, 
the resolution rates of percutaneous treatment of biliobiliary 
strictures were reported to be from 61.4% to 90.9%.47-50 Al￾though advances in conventional techniques have increased 
the clinical success rates, these methods are unsuccessful for 
severe stenotic strictures through which passage of a guide￾wire is impossible. Therefore, these methods cannot be used to 
resolve all biliobiliary strictures. Moreover, with conventional 
methods, the clinical resolution rates are lower than the tech￾nical success rates, because of stricture recurrence. Repeated 
pneumatic dilation can cause traumatic tissue injury and 
promote a fibrotic reaction resulting in the recurrence of stric￾tures.51
The early complication rates after MCA are not reported in 
most studies (Table 1). The main adverse event is mild chol￾angitis, which can be resolved with conservative treatment.22,23
The only reported adverse event occurring from magnet 
approximation to the removal of the indwelling catheter is a 
slight fever.34 Doppler ultrasound is performed to evaluate the 
vessel because the risk of vessel rupture is a concern during the 
early stages of MCA.17,19 However, no blood vessel rupture has 
been reported to date. As the magnets gradually get closer to 
each other during a long period after magnet approximation, 
the intervening vessels are not compressed or ruptured. The 
mean duration of full magnet approximation is 53.3 days in 
biliobiliary strictures and 7–40 days in bilioenteric strictures.23
No late adverse events and MCA procedure-related mortal￾ity have been reported during the follow-up. Adverse events 
related to magnets have not been reported because the mag-

270
nets are aseptic devices that do not induce an inflammatory or 
immune reaction in the bile duct. Moreover, no adverse events 
directly related to other equipment used in MCA have been 
reported because the MCA procedure is performed using con￾ventional ERCP techniques and a PTBD tract. Therefore, the 
MCA procedure seems to be safe in patients undergoing liver 
transplantation or with an immunocompromised status.
The length of the stricture is an important consideration for 
a successful MCA. The strictures are usually longer and the 
shape is more tortuous in LDLT recipients than in OLT recip￾ients. Moreover, the distance between the approximated mag￾nets is shorter for bilioenteric anastomoses (2–7 mm) than 
for biliobiliary anastomoses (2–15 mm). The technical factors 
influencing the effectiveness of MCA are stricture length, 
duration from LDLT to stricture occurrence, shape of the bile 
duct, and magnetic power of the magnets. The maximal stric￾ture length for a successful MCA has not been confirmed and 
needs to be evaluated.
MCA creates a new fistula tract through tissue necrosis 
instead of simple dilation of fibrotic tissue in BBSs; thus, the 
recurrence rate seems to be lower than that with other con￾ventional treatments. The possibility of elastic recoiling in 
the fistula formed by MCA may be lower. Moreover, a PTBD 
catheter is not needed and the risk of infection is low after 
recanalization with MCA. However, the long-term efficacy of 
MCA should be clarified by further large-scale and long-term 
follow-up studies.
As MCA is applied in biliary strictures that could not be

resolved using conventional methods, it is difficult to compare 
its advantages and disadvantages with those of convention￾al methods, and it cannot replace conventional methods. 
Currently, MCA is not widely used because the magnets and 
equipment used in MCA are not commercially available, and 
cases that are indicated for MCA are relatively rare.
Post-orthotopic liver transplantation strictures
BBSs are more frequent after LDLT than after OLT.52-56
Overall, the incidence of BBSs is 25%–32% after LDLT57-61 and 
5%–15% after OLT.39,60,62 The higher incidence of post-LDLT 
strictures is due to technical aspects of the operation because 
ductal anastomosis between the donor and the recipient 
during LDLT is complicated. Moreover, the duct of the donor 
liver has many variants, including multiple bile ducts, a poor 
blood supplement, and a relatively short stump for the anasto￾mosis.9,60,61,63
The MCA process in post-OLT strictures is the same as in 
post-LDLT strictures (Fig. 3). The level of post-OLT strictures 
is more distal in the CBD than that of post-LDLT strictures. 
Post-OLT strictures are mid-level BBSs but post-LDLT stric￾tures are high-level BBSs. In addition, intrahepatic ducts 
(IHDs) are more dilated but less angulated and tortuous in 
post-OLT strictures than in post-LDLT strictures. Therefore, 
MCA is more feasible and the success rate is high in post-OLT 
strictures (Fig. 3). 
Post-cholecystectomy strictures
Bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy has 
occurred with an incidence of 0.3%–0.6%.64 The type of biliary 
injuries can be categorized according to the Bismuth,65 Stras￾berg,66 and Stewart-Way classifications.67 The Stewart-Way 
classification categorizes biliary injuries into four types ac￾cording to the mechanism and anatomy.67 Stewart-Way class 
I injuries are immediately resolved during the operation. 
Stewart-Way class II injuries with stricture are managed with

insertion of MPSs and FCSEMS. Stewart-Way class III and 
IV injuries can be treated using multidisciplinary methods.68
A combined endoscopic-radiologic rendezvous technique 
is needed for complete transection of the main bile duct 
(Stewart-Way class III) and transection of a sectoral bile duct 
(Stewart-Way class IV). This technique can avoid surgical re￾intervention, and can reduce surgical morbidity and mortality. 
These endoscopic-radiologic rendezvous techniques for treat￾ing bile duct stenosis or complete obstruction are feasible only 
if the guidewire can pass through the stricture. MCA can be 
an alternative method for patients with Stewart-Way class III 
and IV ductal injuries that cannot be resolved using rendez￾vous techniques (Fig. 4). The procedure for MCA is similar to 
the procedures applied in patients with post-LDLT strictures.
Other biliary strictures after surgery
Bile duct injury and stricture may also occur after other 
hepatobiliary operations including hepatectomy. Complex dis￾section, poorly defined anatomy, or management of intraop￾erative bleeding by clipping can cause early-phase stricture.69
Late-phase stricture may result from ischemic injury in the bile 
ducts, and a stricture may not develop clinically until several 
years after the initial injury. Endoscopic treatment with MPS 
or FCSEMS insertion is a more preferred method for strictures 
after biliary surgery than percutaneous treatment, but multi￾disciplinary approaches involving endoscopists, radiologists, 
and surgeons are usually required to resolve these complicated 
BBSs. Usually, an endoscopic or percutaneous approach can 
be useful if the guidewire can pass through the BBS. However, 
MCA can be applied when these conventional methods can￾not resolve the BBS. The technique for MCA in this situation 
is also similar to that used for post-LDLT strictures.

MCA FOR BILIOENTERIC STRICTURES
Hepaticojejunostomy site strictures
BBSs are caused by postoperative complications, especially 
after a Roux-en-Y reconstruction, which is the most common 
method of anastomosis in biliary surgery (Table 2). The mean 
distance between the approximated magnets was reported 
to be 4 mm (range, 2–7 mm), and the duration from magnet 
approximation to magnet removal was 7–40 days. Complete 
resolution of the obstruction was accomplished in 41 of 42 
patients (97.6%), and no severe complications were observed. 
The recurrence rate was low (follow-up period: mean, 40 
months; range, 2–53 months). One patient had restenosis at 
6 days after the removal of the indwelling catheter, which was 
treated successfully and without difficulty with balloon dila￾tion.34
The difference in the MCA method between bilioenteric 
anastomosis strictures and biliobilary strictures is the route 
for magnet delivery.24,34,70 The delivery route for magnets in 
biliobiliary strictures is mainly the percutaneous-peroral tract. 
However, the delivery routes for magnets in bilioenteric stric￾tures are various and include the percutaneous-peroral tract, 
surgically formed percutaneous-enteric tract, or percutane￾ous-percutaneous tract. The method of magnet delivery to 
the percutaneous tract is similar to that described previously. 
With the peroral approach, a forward-viewing endoscope is 
used instead of an ERCP scope.23 A peroral approach with 
the forward-viewing endoscope is sometimes difficult in pa￾tients with long and redundant afferent loops. Single-balloon 
enteroscopy is feasible in these situations.71 If the endoscope 
cannot approach the stricture site, magnets can be delivered 
through a surgically formed percutaneous-enteric fistula.23
When the left and right IHDs are anastomosed separately to 
the jejunum and the stricture occurs in the right IHD, two 
PTCS scopes can be applied for MCA.72 One magnet is moved 
through the right IHD using one PTCS scope, and the other 
through the left IHD to approximate via the left IHD tract 
using another PTCS scope. The cases described above provide 
the possible methods of magnet delivery that can be applied in 
various situations.

CONCLUSIONS
MCA is a nonsurgical alternative for treating severe or 
completely obstructing BBSs that cannot be resolved using 
conventional endoscopic or percutaneous methods. MCA is 
safe and feasible in the management of biliobiliary and bilio￾enteric strictures occurring after various operations. Although 
an effective and reliable pre-MCA assessment method has not 
yet been established, modification of magnets and develop￾ment of effective magnet delivery systems have increased the 
success rate of MCA. The understanding of the mechanisms 
and principles of MCA by endoscopists can expand the clin￾ical indications of MCA and enable further applications and 
developments of this method.
