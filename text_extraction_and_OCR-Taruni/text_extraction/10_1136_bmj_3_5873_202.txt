carcinoma of the oesophagus, breast, bladder, kidney, and
thyroid (table IV). These results were not negligible because
some of the tumours, such as cancers of the bladder, the kidney
(fig. 3), and the thyroid (fig. 4), were insensitive to the available
chemotherapeutic agents. Bladder carcinoma had been previous￾ly shown by us to be sensitive to VM 26 (E.O.R.T.C., 1972).
Three of the tumours which regressed were in the pleura. That
again suggests that VP 16213 as well as VM 26 may have a
special affinity for mesothelia. There were 15 deaths
among the patients with solid tumours. Only one of the deaths
was due to chemotherapy.
Discussion
Epipodophyllotoxin VP 16213 represents an advance in the
treatment of acute monocytoid leukaemia, which has been in￾sensitive to any drug up till now (Mathe and Kenis, 1973).
This is also true for acute myelomonocytoid leukaemia, in
which it was often impossible to obtain a complete remission in
some patients because of the persistence of monocytoid cells
in the blood despite the sensitivity of the myeloid cells to cyto￾sine arabinoside (fig. 3) (Mathe et al., 1973). VP 16213 also
seems to be effective in bladder, kidney, and thyroid carcinomas,
against which the available drugs were currently doing very
badly (except VM 26 for bladder cancer). The Urology Co￾operative Group of E.O.R.T.C. is to conduct further phase II
or phase III trials of VP 16213 in the treatmnent of bladder
cancers, with more patients under different conditions.
VP 16213 exercises some effect on cases of reticulosarcoma,
Hodgkin's disease, melanoma, and carcinoma of breast and
ovary, for which there are other active drugs. Thus operational
trials will be conducted by the different Co-operative Groups
of E.O.R.T.C. in these areas.
VP 16213 was supplied by Sandoz Laboratory.

Abdominal Bruit after Renal Transplantation
S. J. JACHUCK, R. WILKINSON
British Medical.Journal, 1972, 3, 202-203
Summary
Forty-seven recipients of renal ailografts have been
studied at varying intervals of up to five years after
transplantation. Renal artery bruit occurred in eight of
16 patients observed over the first two post-transplant
months and disappeared spontaneously in four of these.
The disappearance of the bruit was associated with poor
renal function. Renal bruits were audible in 10 patients
examined more than two months after transplantation;
nine of these were hypertensive and of six in whom
arteriography was performed five were shown to have
stenosis of the allograft artery. By contrast only eight of
37 patients without abdominal bruit were hypertensive,
and arteriography in 10 normotensive patients without
bruit showed no stenosis. It is concluded that while a
renal artery bruit during the first two months after
transplantation may be a marker of good renal blood
flow at the time, its presence suggests a poor long-term
prognosis since persistence of the murmur indicates
that significant stenosis of the allograft artery is likely,
while its disappearance is associated with poor renal
function.

Introduction
Abdominal bruit is a useful clinical sign in the diagnosis of
renovascular hypertension (Simon et al., 1972). In renal trans￾plant recipients bruits over the allograft renal artery have been
regarded on the one hand as a sign of narrowing of the artery
(Kincaid-Smith et al., 1969), and on the other as a sign of good
renal perfusion (Braun, 1972; Anderson et al., 1973). This
conflicting evidence on the significance of arterial bruits
prompted us to review our surviving renal transplant recipients
in order to determine the relation of bruit to hypertension and
to graft function.
Patients and Methods
Forty-seven recipients of renal allografts were studied from
two to 60 months after transplantation. Sixteen of these patients
were also studied during the first eight postoperative weeks. In
26 patients the donor was a relative, in the remaining 21 cadaver
kidneys were used.
Blood pressure was recorded in the supine position and
hypertension defined as a persistently raised diastolic blood
pressure above 100 mm Hg. Abdominal auscultation was
carried out in the mid-line above and below the umbilicus,
over the medial border of the transplanted kidney, and over
the femoral arteries.
Selective arteriography of the allograft artery was performed
in seven patients because of hypertension and in 10 without
hypertension or rejection as part of a separate study.
In those 16 patients observed over the first eight weeks after
transplantation daily blood counts and renal function tests
were performed as well as clinical assessment for evidence of

rejection until stable renal function was established. Thereafter,
assessment was twice weekly up to eight weeks and then at
increasing intervals in all patients depending on the stability
of function.
Results
SITE OF BRUIT
The abdominal bruits were systolic in time and not transmitted
from the heart. The sites at which bruits were heard are shown
in table I. The medial aspect of the transplanted kidney was the
commonest situation.

HYPERTENSION AND BRUIT
The relation between hypertension and the presence of
abdominal bruit showed that while nine of the 10 patients with
a bruit were hypertensive, only eight of 37 without bruit had
raised blood pressure.
ANGIOGRAPHY
The results of allograft angiography in the seven patients with
severe hypertension and persistent abdominal bruit subjected
to this procedure are shown in table II. In this group the inci￾dence of arterial stenosis is high. However, patients with bruit
and lesser degrees of hypertension have not been subjected to
arteriography, so we cannot be certain of the significance of
bruit in all cases. In 10 normotensive patients without abdominal
bruit arteriography showed no vascular stenosis.

EARLY BRUIT
Of the 16 patients studied in the early post-transplant period
eight developed abdominal bruit. This appeared within the first
48 hours and in four patients it disappeared during the ensuing
eight weeks. Arteriography was performed in two of the four
patients in whom bruit persisted beyond eight weeks and in
both cases showed stenosis of the allograft artery.
At the time of appearance of the bruit all 16 patients were
anaemic. The mean haemoglobin on the day after transplantation
in those with bruit was 9i2 g/100 ml (S.D. 1-12) and in those
without bruit 9-0 g/100 ml (S.D. 1-58)-the difference was not
significant (P > 035). At two months after transplant the mean
haemoglobin had risen in both the original bruit and non-bruit
groups to 103 (S.D. 1-79) and 10 0 (S.D. 2 5) g/100 ml res￾pectively; again the difference was not significant (P > 035).
The mean haemoglobin in the four patients in whom bruit
persisted was 11-35 g while in the four in whom bruit
disappeared it was 9-3 g/100 ml.
The mean level of serum creatinine in patients in whom a
bruit had been heard at some stage was 3-35 mg/100 ml (S.D.
3 0) and in those without bruit 3-27 mg/100 ml (S.D. 2 89)-the
difference was not significant (P > 0475). However, in those
four patients in whom a murmur was initially heard but later
disappeared the mean serum creatinine was 5-2 mg/100 ml
compared with 1-5 mg/100 ml in those in whom the bruit
persisted.
Discussion
Arterial bruits are produced by turbulent flow, which may be
induced by irregularity or stenosis of the vessel or by increased
flow within the vessel especially when this is accompanied by
decreased blood viscosity (Wales and Martin, 1963).
EARLY BRUIT
An arterial bruit was audible over the transplanted kidney in
half of our patients in the early postoperative period. This
could not be explained by the presence of anaemia since those
with bruit were not more anaemic than those without. Further￾more the bruit disappeared in three of the patients despite a
slight reduction in haemoglobin level. It is possible that initial
irregularity at the anastomotic site becoming smooth as epi￾thelialization proceeds accounts for the early murmurs which
do not persist. Though the number of patients is too small for
valid statistical analysis, however, it appears that disappearance
of the bruit may be associated with increasing serum creatinine,
suggesting that the murmur may be an indicator of good renal
blood flow and its disappearance may reflect reduction in renal
blood flow. Though absence of a bruit is by no means in￾compatible with good renal function the disappearance of an
established murmur may herald worsening renal function.
These results are broadly in agreement with those of Anderson
et al. (1973), who found patients with persistent bruit to have the
best renal function and those in whom an early bruit
disappeared to have the worst. Braun (1972) also found that
the presence of a bruit indicated good renal function.
LATE BRUIT
Though the finding of a bruit in the early post-transplant period
was often associated with good renal function, we found that a
bruit persisting more than two months after transplantation
was usually accompanied by hypertension.
In those patients with bruit subjected to arteriography
stenosis of the allograft artery was usually found. These findings
are in accord with those of Morris and his colleagues (1971). We
cannot comment on the likely incidence of allograft arterial
stenosis in those patients with hypertension without renal bruit
since we did not routinely perform arteriography in the absence
of bruit. However, we did find renal artery stenosis in one
patient with hypertension without bruit. No normotensive
patients were found to have stenosis of the renal artery. This
association of bruit with hypertension and allograft artery
stenosis was not reported by Anderson et al. (1973) in their
series of patients, but examination of their data shows that
eight of their nine hypertensive patients had persisting renal
bruit.
We therefore conclude that though the presence of a bruit
over the transplanted kidney in the early postoperative period
may be an indicator of good renal blood flow, the finding
suggests a poor long-term prognosis. The disappearance of the
bruit is usually accompanied by worsening renal function, and a
persistent murmur is almost invariably a sign of stenosis of the
graft artery sufficient to cause hypertension.

J. Swinney, Mr. R. M. R. Taylor, and Mr. R. W. G. Johnson who
