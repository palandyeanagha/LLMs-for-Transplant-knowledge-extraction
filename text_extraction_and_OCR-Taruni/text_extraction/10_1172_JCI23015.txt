cells, are the major source for regeneration 
in postischemic kidney

Ischemic injury to the kidney produces acute tubular necrosis and apoptosis followed by tubular regeneration
and recovery of renal function. Although mitotic cells are present in the tubules of postischemic kidneys, the
origins ofthe proliferating cells are not known. Bone marrow cells (BMCs) can differentiate across lineages to
repair injured organs, including the kidney. However, the relative contribution of intrarenal cells and extra￾renal cells to kidney regeneration is not clear. We produced transgenic mice that expressed enhanced GFP
(EGFP) specifically and permanently in mature renal tubular epithelial cells. Following ischemia/reperfusion
injury (IRI), EGFP-positive cells showed incorporation of BrdU and expression of vimentin, which provides
direct evidence that the cells composing regenerating tubules are derived from renal tubular epithelial cells.
In BMC-transplanted mice, 89% of proliferating epithelial cells originated from host cells, and 11% originated
from donor BMCs. Twenty-eight days after IRI, the kidneys contained 8% donor-derived cells, of which 8.4%
were epithelial cells, 10.6% were glomerular cells, and 81% were interstitial cells. No renalfunctional improve￾ment was observed in mice that were transplanted with exogenous BMCs. These results show that intrarenal
cells are the main source of renal repair, and a single injection of BMCs does not make a significant contribu￾tion to renal functional or structural recovery.
Introduction
Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) of the kidney causes necrosis and 
apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (1, 2). Dead cells detach 
from the tubular basement membrane, leaving denuded basement 
membrane. Over time, the injured tubules regenerate through cell 
proliferation, as reflected by the expression of proliferating cell 
nuclear antigen (PCNA) (3). Tubular regeneration restores normal 
tubular architecture and renal function. However the source of the 
proliferating cells that repopulate the injured nephron is not clear. 
Tissue regeneration may result from proliferation and differentia￾tion of resident stem/progenitor cells, proliferation of surviving 
dedifferentiated cells, or “transdifferentiation” of cells that origi￾nate from outside the injured organ (1, 4–11). In this study we test￾ed whether kidney regeneration fits into this general paradigm.
Recently, Oliver et al. discovered that the renal papilla is a niche 
for adult kidney stem cells. These slow-cycling cells can prolifer￾ate and may participate in renal regeneration after ischemic injury 
(12). In addition to increased proliferative activity, regenerating 
tubules show decreased cellular differentiation following IRI. Sev￾eral genes that are expressed during embryonic development and 
are downregulated in the mature kidney are reexpressed during 
recovery from renal injury (13). One example is the transcription 
factor paired box gene 2 (Pax2), which is transiently expressed 
in developing nephrons during early nephrogenesis and is reex￾pressed in regenerating proximal tubules (14). The intermediate 
filament vimentin is expressed in the metanephric mesenchymal 
cells that are the progenitors of the epithelial cells of the nephron. 
Vimentin is normally not significantly expressed in well-differen￾tiated renal tubular epithelial cells but is reexpressed in injured 
tubular cells (3). Based on these observations, it has been postu￾lated that the cells that regenerate injured tubules are derived from 
surviving tubular epithelial cells that dedifferentiate and reenter 
the cell cycle (3, 15). However, no studies have directly proven that 
this is the case.
Another potential source of regenerating tubular cells is cross￾lineage differentiation of cells that are of extrarenal origin. There 
is increasing evidence that circulating stem cells can enter the 
kidney and differentiate into renal cells after various injuries. We 
and others have shown that bone marrow cells (BMCs) can differ￾entiate into tubular epithelial cells, glomerular endothelial cells, 
podocytes, mesangial cells, and renal interstitial cells (16–22). 
After transplanting hematopoietic stem cells isolated from male 
Rosa26 mice, we detected cells expressing β-gal in the renal tubules 
in female wild-type mice that had renal IRI. The male-specific sex 
determining region of chromosome Y (Sry) gene and cells carrying 
a Y chromosome were also detected in the kidney (16). In male 
patients who received kidney transplants from female donors, Y 
chromosome–containing cells that expressed renal tubular cell 
markers were observed in kidneys that had sustained injury due 
to a variety of causes (18, 19). Morigi et al. showed that bone mar￾row mesenchymal stem cells could differentiate into renal tubular 
epithelial cells and improve renal function (23). However, the rela￾tive contribution of extrarenal cells and intrarenal cells to kidney 
regeneration has not been evaluated. In addition, the formation 
of different types of renal cells from BMCs has not been examined

systematically in a single study. We sought to address the relative 
importance of intrinsic renal cells and BMCs in kidney regenera￾tion, as well as the plasticity of BMCs in forming kidney cells.
Results
Lineage marking of renal tubular epithelial cells with enhanced GFP. To 
measure the contribution of intrinsic renal cells to tubular regen￾eration, we performed lineage analysis using cre/loxP recombina￾tion. The Z/EG double reporter mouse strain carries a ubiquitous 
promoter linked to a lacZ gene that is flanked by 2 loxP sites and 
an enhanced GFP (EGFP) reporter gene that resides further down￾stream (24). In the absence of cre recombinase, lacZ is expressed 
in most tissues, including kidney cells. In the presence of cre 
recombinase, recombination between the loxP sites deletes the lacZ
sequence and activates the EGFP reporter gene. Since the activa￾tion of the reporter gene is irreversible and heritable, EGFP will be 
expressed in all progeny cells irrespective of the continued pres￾ence of cre recombinase. Therefore, the fate of the cre-expressing 
cells can be easily traced.
To label renal tubular epithelial cells, we crossed Z/EG mice 
with creksp transgenic mice that express cre recombinase under 
the control of the kidney-specific Ksp-cadherin promoter 
(ksp). Previous studies have shown that creksp mice express cre 
exclusively in tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (25). Cre is 
expressed in all segments of the nephron, including proximal 
tubules, loops of Henle, distal tubules, and collecting ducts. 
There is no expression in blood vessels, glomerular cells, or 
interstitial cells. During embryonic development, cre is only 
expressed in maturing renal tubules and collecting ducts. 
There is no expression in early nephric structures, includ￾ing mesenchymal condensates, renal vesicles, or comma- and 
S-shaped bodies. Therefore, crosses between creksp mice and 
Z/EG mice should generate creksp;Z/EG offspring in which 
mature renal tubular epithelial cells and their progeny are 
permanently labeled with EGFP. Continuous expression of 
EGFP is independent of the ksp promoter. Tracking EGFP￾expressing cells in regenerating kidneys thus permits studies 
of tubular epithelial cell fate during renal repair.
Figure 1 shows the kidneys of creksp;Z/EG mice analyzed at 
6 weeks of age. Native EGFP fluorescence was detected in 
tubules in the renal cortex and medulla (Figure 1A), where￾as under identical exposure conditions, green fluorescence 
was absent in kidneys of wild-type littermates (Figure 1A, 
inset). To identify the nephron segments in which EGFP was 
expressed, we stained paraffin sections of the kidneys with 
an anti-EGFP antibody and then with renal tubular mark￾ers. EGFP was expressed in proximal tubules that were labeled 
with Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (LTA), thick ascending limbs 
that expressed Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), distal tubules that 
expressed the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC), and 
collecting ducts that were labeled with Dolichos biflorus aggluti￾nin (DBA) (Figure 1, B–E). Especially in the proximal and distal 
tubules, EGFP was expressed in some cells but not in others, which 
indicated that the expression was mosaic. The mosaic expression 
pattern of EGFP in creksp;Z/EG mice was due to inefficient cre/loxP

recombination and heterocellular activity of the Z/EG promoter. 
Antibody staining showed that 45% of the renal tubules in creksp
mice expressed cre protein. In Z/EG mice, 53% of tubular cells 
were X-gal positive. In the bitransgenic offspring of creksp and Z/EG
mice, we detected EGFP in 34% of tubular cells. Glomerular and 
interstitial cells showed no expression of EGFP (Figure 1F), which 
is consistent with the tubular epithelial cell–specific activity of the 
Ksp-cadherin promoter (25, 26).
Tubular regeneration from intrarenal cells. Female creksp;Z/EG mice 
(6–8 weeks old) were subjected to 45 minutes of unilateral IRI 
of the left kidney, as described previously (13). To simultane￾ously measure the incorporation of exogenous bone marrow 
stem cells, the mice were injected with BMCs isolated from male 
C57BL/6 mice. Age-matched, sham-operated mice were given 
BMC injection as a control. The left kidneys showed exten￾sive tubular necrosis and apoptosis, with loss of brush border 
membrane, cell detachment from the basement membrane, and 
nuclear condensation in some cells (Figure 2A). Cell death was 
followed by cell proliferation, as evidenced by PCNA expression 
in the outer stripe of the outer medulla at 2 days after IRI (Figure 
2B). This region of the kidney contains the S3 segments of proxi￾mal tubules that are particularly susceptible to ischemic injury. 
PCNA expression in postischemic kidney was time dependent. At 
1 day after IRI, 9.4% ± 2.0% of the tubular cells expressed PCNA, 
and the expression was higher at 2 days (34% ± 5.1%; n = 4). In 
contrast, PCNA expression in age-matched control kidneys was 
0.68% ± 0.07% at 2 days following sham operation (n = 4). At 7 
days after IRI, PCNA expression declined to 16% ± 2.5%, and at 
28 days, only 0.2% ± 0.04% of the cells expressed PCNA, which 
was not significantly different from the level of 0.07% observed 
in age-matched control kidneys.
We measured BrdU incorporation to evaluate cell regeneration 
(10). Mice were injected with BrdU for 14 days following ischemic 
injury, and then the kidneys were removed, sectioned, and stained 
with an anti-BrdU antibody. Figure 2C is a low-power image of the 
postischemic kidney showing BrdU incorporation in tubular cells, 
some of which expressed EGFP. At 28 days, 7.6% ± 0.3% of tubu￾lar cells incorporated BrdU when an average of 1,100 nuclei were 
counted on 2 adjacent kidney sections (n = 3). In contrast, only 
0.4% ± 0.13% tubular cells incorporated BrdU in sham-operated 
mouse kidneys (n = 4). Most of the BrdU-positive cells were locat￾ed in the outer stripe of the outer medulla and stained positive 
with LTA, which indicates that they represented S3 segments of 
proximal tubules. BrdU-positive cells were also detected in THP￾expressing thick ascending limbs and aquaporin-2–expressing 
collecting ducts (data not shown). These results indicated robust 
tubular regeneration after injury. Costaining of the ischemic kid￾ney with antibodies to BrdU and EGFP showed that BrdU was 
incorporated into the DNA of EGFP-positive cells (Figure 2D). 
These results provide direct evidence for tubular regeneration 
from EGFP-expressing tubular cells.
BrdU incorporation was also observed in the contralateral 
nonischemic kidney (data not shown). However, we did not detect 
BrdU in EGFP-positive cells in the uninjured kidney. To evaluate 
the degree of cell regeneration from EGFP-expressing cells, we 
measured the number of EGFP-expressing cells in the proximal 
tubules, the sites where more injury and regeneration occurs. As 
indicated by the mosaic pattern of EGFP expression in creksp;Z/EG
mice, not all the proximal tubular cells expressed EGFP. Because 
the baseline level of EGFP expression in the proximal tubules was 
low, changes were quantifiable, whereas in the distal nephron, the 
baseline expression was too high to allow detection of a change in 
the percentage of labeled cells. In the injured kidney, 54% ± 4.9% of 
proximal tubular cells were EGFP positive, whereas 34% ± 7.8% of 
proximal tubular cells in the uninjured kidney were EGFP positive. 
The difference in the percentage of EGFP-expressing cells between 
injured and uninjured cells was statistically significant (n = 4; 
P < 0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that epithelial cells 
are the main precursors for tubular repair, which accounts for the 
increased number of EGFP-positive cells in the proximal tubule in 
the kidneys that had recovered from injury.
Dedifferentiation of mature epithelial cells as the mechanism of renal 
repair. The expression of 2 dedifferentiation markers, Pax2 and 
vimentin, was examined in the regenerating kidneys (3, 14). At 3 
days after injury, cells in some areas of the proximal tubules lacked 
a brush border, as indicated by the absence of LTA staining. The 
cells in these regions expressed Pax2 (Figure 3A). In the proximal 
tubules where Pax2 was reexpressed, 37% ± 0.2% of the cells incor￾porated BrdU (n = 3). No proximal tubular expression of Pax2 was 
observed in sham-operated kidneys or the contralateral nonisch￾emic kidney. The expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibi￾tor p21 was downregulated in the tubules that expressed Pax2 (Fig￾ure 3B). Vimentin, a marker for dedifferentiated tubular cells, was 
detected in the proximal tubules (Figure 3C). Importantly, vimentin 
was expressed in EGFP-positive cells (Figure 3D), which indicated

that the dedifferentiated cells originated from preexisting mature 
tubular epithelial cells. In the contralateral kidney, no expression 
of vimentin was detected in any tubules. At 28 days after IRI, no 
expression of vimentin was detected in any tubules, and Pax2 was 
no longer detected in the proximal tubules. These results indicate 
that regenerated tubules had become mature epithelial cells.
EGFP-expressing cells that incorporated BrdU reestablished cell 
polarity, as indicated by the presence of AQP3 on the basal cell 
membrane (Figure 3E). The formation of apical tight junctions 
around BrdU-positive cells was indicated by the localization of 
zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) (Figure 3F). The presence of proliferat￾ing AQP3-expressing cells indicates that collecting duct cells were 
injured and regenerated in this model of IRI.
Intrinsic renal cells are the major source of renal regeneration. The rela￾tive contribution of tubule-derived cells and BMC-derived cells to 
renal regeneration was analyzed in 6- to 8-week-old wild-type con￾genic female mice that received BMCs from 6- to 
8-week-old wild-type male donors. To distin￾guish male cells from female cells, we performed 
Y chromosome FISH and identified proliferat￾ing cells by anti-BrdU staining. Kidneys were 
harvested at 28 days after injury, a time point 
at which kidney regeneration is completed, and 
4-µm-thick sections were hybridized with a Y 
chromosome painting probe. We measured the 
sensitivity and specificity of Y chromosome FISH 
by analyzing kidneys from male and female mice 
that did not receive BMC transplants. Abundant 
Y chromosome signals were detected at the 
periphery of the nuclei in the cells of kidneys of 
male mice (Figure 4A). The sensitivity of FISH 
was calculated as 64% (n = 5). In contrast, in the 
female kidney, there was a complete absence of 
Y chromosome signals (Figure 4B; n = 5), which 
corresponded to a specificity of 100%. BrdU￾positive cells, Y chromosome–positive cells, and 
total tubular cells were counted in 10 randomly 
selected fields in the outer stripe of outer medul￾la (n = 4). The results are summarized in Table 1. 
The percentage of Y chromosome–positive cells 
was corrected for the 64% sensitivity of Y chro￾mosome FISH analysis. Among all BrdU-posi￾tive cells in the tubules, 89% did not contain a 
Y chromosome, which indicated that they origi￾nated from host cells. The remaining 11% of the 
tubular cells contained a Y chromosome, which 
indicated that they originated from injected 
BMCs. Therefore, intrinsic renal cells are the 
major source for renal tubular regeneration.
BMCs can become renal tubular epithelial cells. We 
have previously shown that transplantation of 
sorted hematopoietic stem cells isolated from 
male Rosa26 mice into nontransgenic female 
recipients after renal IRI resulted in the appear￾ance of β-gal–positive cells in the proximal 
tubules (16). In addition, PCR of the male-spe￾cific Sry gene and Y chromosome FISH showed 
the presence of male-derived cells in the female 
kidney. To more clearly define the donor-derived 
cells in the kidneys, we performed Y chromo￾some FISH followed by immunohistochemistry (27). Twenty-eight 
days after injury, incorporation of BrdU was detected in Y chromo￾some–positive cells in the renal tubules, which indicated prolifera￾tion of BMC-derived cells (Figure 4C). No CD45-positive cells were 
detected in the tubules, which indicated the absence of infiltrating 
hematopoietic cells (tubulitis). To confirm the formation of renal 
tubular epithelial cells from BMCs, we performed Y chromosome 
FISH analysis followed by immunostaining with the epithelial cell 
marker cytokeratin. Y chromosome was detected in cells express￾ing cytokeratin (Figure 4D). Renal proximal tubules sustain the 
most injury and are most active in regeneration in mouse models 
of IRI (3, 28). Staining with the proximal tubule–specific lectin 
LTA showed the presence of Y chromosome in proximal tubular 
cells (Figure 4E). BMC-derived cells were also observed in the col￾lecting duct, a segment that is thought to be relatively resistant to 
IRI (3). The Y chromosome–positive collecting duct cells expressed

without BMC injection. n = 5–13 at each time point; total 84 mice.

AQP3, which indicated that they were principal cells (Figure 4F). In 
addition, the labeling of the basolateral membrane by AQP3 clearly 
defines the intratubular localization of BMC-derived cells. Taken 
together, these results indicate that BMCs can differentiate into 
tubular epithelial cells that express tubular structural proteins and 
water channels. When BMCs isolated from male creksp;Z/EG mice 
were transplanted into wild-type female mice with renal IRI, no 
native EGFP fluorescence or EGFP expression by immunostaining 
was detected, although Y chromosome–positive cells were present 
in renal tubules (Figure 4, G and H). This result indicates that 
the EGFP-positive cells that were observed in the kidney were not 
derived from BMCs.
BMCs make a minor contribution to renal repair. Renal IRI causes 
decreased glomerular filtration rate and elevated blood urea nitro￾gen (BUN) levels. Following IRI, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
returns to near baseline within 1 week (29). We measured BUN 
levels in sham-operated mice without BMC injection and in mice 
with left renal IRI with or without BMC injection. BMCs were 
harvested from male B6-Ly5.2/Cr mice that carry CD45.1 and 
were injected into recipient female C57BL/6NCr mice that carry 
CD45.2. The right kidney was removed to eliminate its contribu￾tion to GFR. BUN levels were 20 ± 2 mg/dl in sham-operated mice 
1 day after surgery. In contrast, mice that underwent renal IRI 
without BMC injection had elevated BUN levels of 87 ± 8 mg/dl. 
BMC injection did not reduce BUN levels (91 ± 12 mg/dl) in mice 
with renal IRI (Figure 4I). There was no statistically significant 
difference in BUN levels in mice with or without BMC injection 
between 1 and 7 days after injury (n = 5–13 at each time point; 
total 84 mice). The absence of improved renal function was not 
due to the failure of BMC transplantation. Flow cytometry analy￾sis at 28 days showed that 38% of the peripheral nucleated cells 
carried the CD45.1 donor cell marker, which indicated successful 
engraftment of BMCs.
The absence of a renal protective effect suggested that transplant￾ed BMCs made only a limited contribution to kidney regeneration 
in the first week after injury. We found that Y chromosome–posi￾tive cells began to appear in the interstitium and glomeruli as early 
as 2 days after injury. However, the earliest time point at which Y 
chromosome–positive cells could be detected in the tubules was 5 
days. At 7 days, only 1 or 2 tubular cells/section were Y chromo￾some positive, and no more than 8 total Y chromosome–positive 
cells/kidney section could be detected.
BMCs can form multiple types of glomerular cells. In addition to form￾ing epithelial cells, transplanted BMCs also differentiated into glo￾merular and interstitial cells. In the kidney, the number of Y chro￾mosome–positive cells increased with time after injury. We counted 
the total number of Y chromosome–positive cells in the kidney as 
well as Y chromosome–positive cells in the tubules, glomeruli, and 
interstitium at 28 days after IRI (n = 4). Ten fields of the cortex and 
medulla were randomly selected for counting. The results are sum￾marized in Table 2. An average of 52 Y chromosome–positive cells 
per 1,011 kidney cells were detected. This implies that 8% of the 
total number of kidney cells were donor-derived, after correction 
was made for the 64% sensitivity of Y chromosome FISH. Among 
these cells, 8.4% were tubular epithelial cells, 10.6% were glomerular 
cells, and 81% were interstitial cells (Figure 5).
The formation of glomerular cells from BMCs was examined 
in greater detail. Of 436 glomeruli counted, 180 (41%) contained 
1–4 Y chromosome–positive cells/glomerulus (Figure 6A). Of 
316 glomeruli counted, only 1 CD45-positive cell was detected 
(data not shown). Since common leukocyte antigen CD45 is only 
expressed on the cell surface of hematopoietic cells, the rarity of 
CD45-positive cells indicated that the majority of hematopoi￾etic cells in the glomeruli had differentiated into non-hemato￾poietic cells. Alternatively, mesenchymal stem cells in the BMCs 
could have contributed to glomerular cell formation. To identify 
endothelial cells, we stained the kidney sections with Lycopersi￾con esculentum lectin (LEL) (30). Donor-derived cells were CD45-
negative and LEL-positive, which suggested endothelial forma￾tion from transplanted BMCs (Figure 6B). Some donor-derived 
cells in the glomeruli expressed vimentin and did not express 
Wt1, which suggested that they were mesangial cells (Figure 6C). 
Donor-derived podocytes expressing Wt1 (31) were also detected 
(Figure 6D). Among all donor-derived cells in the glomeruli, 35% 
were endothelial cells, 31% were mesangial cells, 27% were podo￾cytes, and 7% were parietal epithelial cells (n = 4). Since a total 
of 10.6% of bone marrow–derived cells in the kidney formed glo￾merular cells, these values indicate that 3.8% of the BMCs formed 
endothelial cells, 3.4% formed mesangial cells, 3.0% formed podo￾cytes, and 0.7% formed parietal epithelial cells (Figure 5).
Most bone marrow–derived cells in the kidney do not continue 
hematopoiesis and may contribute to interstitial fibrosis. Because long￾term hematopoietic stem cells can adopt a traditional hemato￾poietic cell fate when injected into the ischemic myocardium (32), 
we studied the developmental potential of BMCs in the kidney. 
Examination of 4 serial sections of 5 different kidneys showed 
that none of the BrdU-positive cells in the tubules expressed 
CD45, and no Y chromosome and CD45 double-positive cells 
were detected in the tubules, which indicated that a switch to a 
non-hematopoietic lineage had occurred in the renal tubules. 
However, in the interstitium, an average of 11% of the cells were 
Y chromosome and CD45 double-positive at 28 days. Figure 7A

shows the presence of multiple Y chromosome–positive cells in 
the interstitium, and the inset depicts a Y chromosome and CD45 
double-positive cell in the interstitium. A total of 2% and 7% CD45 
positive cells incorporated BrdU at 14 and 28 days, respectively. 
These results suggest that most of the BMCs in the kidney do not 
undergo continuous hematopoiesis.
The increase in donor-derived cells in the kidney was mostly 
observed in the interstitium. At 28 days, 29% of all interstitial cells 
were Y chromosome positive. Donor cells expressing α-SMA, a 
marker for myofibroblasts, were detected (Figure 7B). Trichrome 
staining showed collagenous interstitial lesions and fibrosis (Fig￾ure 7C). In contrast, the kidney that had recovered from IRI but 
did not receive BMC injection showed minimal collagen accumu￾lation in the interstitium (Figure 7D). These results suggest that 
transplanted BMCs may be involved in renal interstitial fibrosis.
Discussion
We generated creksp;Z/EG mice that expressed EGFP specifically and 
permanently in renal tubular epithelial cells and subjected them to 
unilateral renal ischemic injury. The incorporation of BrdU and 
expression of vimentin in EGFP-expressing cells in the ischemic 
kidney, but not in the contralateral nonischemic kidney, provide 
direct evidence that intrarenal cells can regenerate to repair injured 
tubules. Because vimentin is not normally expressed in mature 
tubular epithelial cells and EGFP is only expressed in the mature 
epithelial cells and their progeny, coexpression of vimentin and 
EGFP indicates dedifferentiation of surviving tubular epithe￾lial cells. Consistent with these findings, expression of Pax2 was 
upregulated in regenerating proximal tubular cells, and expres￾sion of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was downregu￾lated. Tubular regeneration via this mechanism was observed in 
the proximal tubule, a segment of the nephron that is particularly 
susceptible to ischemic injury, as well as in renal collecting ducts, 
which were not previously known to be a major site of ischemic 
injury and regeneration.
We estimated the quantitative contribution of intrarenal cells and 
extrarenal cells to tubular regeneration by infusion of BMCs to the 
mice with renal IRI. Previous studies have shown that bone marrow 
contains hematopoietic stem cells that can be incorporated into 
renal tubules after ischemic injury, but the magnitude of tubular 
regeneration from this source was not known. Following transplan￾tation of BMCs from male donors into female recipients with IRI, 
11% of the BrdU-positive tubular cells were donor-derived, whereas 
the majority of the proliferating cells, 89%, were derived from the 
host. These results confirm that extrarenal bone marrow–derived 
cells can be incorporated into renal tubules after ischemic injury, 
but intrarenal cells are the major source of tubular regeneration.
In adult ischemic kidney, intrarenal cells consist of surviving 
tubular epithelial cells and renal stem cells. It has been hypoth￾esized that the kidney contains residual metanephric stem cells 
that can differentiate into epithelial cells following tubular injury 
(33). Moreover, renal stem cells have been identified in the papilla 
of postnatal kidneys by BrdU labeling of slow-cycling cells (12). 
These stem cells would not express EGFP, which is only expressed 
in mature renal epithelial cells. However, once the progeny of renal 
stem cells differentiate into tubular epithelial cells, EGFP may be 
expressed. The unavailability of renal stem cell markers limits the 
tracing and quantification of stem cell progeny in postischemic 
kidney. In the present study, the EGFP-positive cells in the tubules 
were not derived from BMCs of creksp;Z/EG mice. This conclusion 
is supported by the observation that when we transplanted BMCs 
from male creksp;Z/EG mice into female wild-type mice with renal 
IRI, no EGFP-expressing cells were detected in the renal tubules. 
Although the mosaic expression of EGFP precluded a precise deter￾mination of the relative contribution of tubular cells and renal 
stem cells to renal regeneration, the observation that the regenerat￾ing kidney contained more EGFP-positive proximal tubular cells 
than the contralateral control kidney is consistent with the hypoth￾esis that the majority of regenerating tubular cells originated from 
mature tubular cells and argues against a major contribution of 
BMCs to tubular repair.
The mechanism of tubular epithelial cell dedifferentiation is not 
understood. It is believed that tubular regeneration recapitulates 
tubulogenesis during fetal kidney development. The permanent

kidney, the metanephros, develops from reciprocal interactions 
between the ureteric bud, which gives rise to the renal collecting sys￾tem, and the metanephric mesenchyme, which forms the nephrons. 
Upon induction by the ureteric bud, metanephric mesenchymal 
cells undergo a mesenchymal-epithelial transition and differentiate 
into tubular epithelial cells. Expression of Pax2 begins in condensed 
metanephric mesenchyme and continues in comma- and S-shaped 
bodies, which are the anlagen of the nephron, including proximal 
tubules (34, 35). As tubulogenesis proceeds, Pax2 is downregulated, 
and mature proximal tubules do not express Pax2. The reexpression 
of Pax2 in proximal tubular cells following injury suggests a rever￾sion to an immature precursor cell phenotype. In cells that express 
Pax2, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is downregulated, 
which suggests cell cycle reentry in regenerating cells. At the same 
time, the intermediate filament, vimentin, is expressed in the epi￾thelial cells. Vimentin is a marker for mesenchymal cells and is not 
normally expressed in tubular epithelial cells (36). Reexpression 
of vimentin in EGFP-expressing tubular epithelial cells suggests 
reversion of epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell–like phenotype. 
Twenty-eight days after injury, as regeneration is completed, the 
tubular cells regain mature epithelial cell polarity and intercellular 
junctions, and vimentin is no longer expressed.
Unlike in organisms such as urodele amphibians that have the 
ability to regenerate a wide variety of tissues via dedifferentia￾tion mechanisms, regeneration in mammals is limited. However, 
regeneration from differentiated cells has been described in mice. 
Recently, Dor et al. showed that preexisting pancreatic β cells 
formed new β cells during adult life and after pancreatectomy 
(10). Terminally differentiated mouse myotubes can dedifferenti￾ate and reenter the cell cycle when treated with an extract from 
regenerating newt limb tissue (37). Moreover, myotube-derived 
mononucleated cells can be induced to redifferentiate into cells 
expressing chondrogenic, adipogenic, myogenic, and osteogenic 
markers when the homeobox-containing transcriptional repres￾sor msx1 is expressed ectopically in mouse myotubes (38). These 
findings suggest that terminally differentiated mammalian cells 
have the ability to become progenitors with appropriate stimuli. 
In Drosophila, germline stem cells can be generated by spermatogo￾nial dedifferentiation (39). Our results show that dedifferentiated 
epithelial cells reenter the cell cycle to proliferate and regenerate 
renal tubules. At present, the full developmental potential of these 
cells is not clear; nor is it clear whether they contribute to renal 
turnover under normal conditions. However, the absence of BrdU 
incorporation in EGFP-expressing cells in the uninjured kidney 
suggests that mature epithelial cells may not participate signifi￾cantly in normal renal turnover.
Renal function usually recovers in 1–2 weeks after IRI. Few bone 
marrow–derived cells were detected in kidney tubules at 7 days 
after injury, which suggests that recovery largely depends on tubu￾lar regeneration from endogenous kidney cells. Consistent with 
this hypothesis, administration of BMCs did not improve renal 
function in mice with ischemic injury. These results are in contrast 
to those from a study by Kale et al., who reported improvement 
of renal function with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 
mice with renal IRI (17). Kale et al. used sorted hematopoietic stem 
cells and performed bilateral IRI, whereas whole BMCs were used 
and unilateral IRI with contralateral nephrectomy was performed 
in the present study. It is possible that in the study performed 
by Kale et al., more hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny 
entered the kidneys to augment functional recovery.
Previously we showed that sorted Lin–Sca-1+ckit+ hematopoietic 
stem cells contributed to renal tubular cell formation following 
IRI. Mesenchymal stem cells that reside in the bone marrow also 
have plasticity in forming multiple types of cells of mesenchymal 
and non-mesenchymal lineages (40, 41). Formation of renal tubu￾lar cells from mouse bone marrow–derived mesenchymal cells has 
been reported (23). The current study aimed to comprehensively 
analyze the types and percentages of renal cells that originated 
from unfractionated BMCs in postischemic kidneys. No CD45-
positive cells were detected in the renal tubules. Since CD45 is only 
present in the hematopoietic cells and not in the mesenchymal 
cell, the absence of CD45-positive cells in the renal tubules could 
suggest conversion of hematopoietic cells to renal cells and/or for￾mation of renal tubular cells from mesenchymal stem cells.
Formation of glomerular cells and endothelial cells from BMCs 
has been reported in several studies. Poulsom et al. observed donor 
BMC-derived podocytes in mouse kidney that was subjected to 
total body irradiation but no other injury (19), which suggested 
that BMCs have a role in normal glomerular turnover. In rats with 
chimeric bone marrow, donor BMC-derived mesangial cells and 
endothelial cells were detected (20). When glomerular injury was 
induced with anti–Thy-1.1 antibody, the number of donor BMC￾derived endothelial cells increased 4-fold at 7 days and the num￾ber of mesangial cells increased 7-fold at 28 days after injury. We 
confirmed these findings by showing the presence of BMC-derived 
podocytes, endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and parietal epithelial 
cells in glomeruli in the kidney that had recovered from ischemic 
injury. In addition, the contribution of BMCs to different cell 
types was quantified. Most BMCs differentiated into renal inter￾stitial cells, while a small percentage of them differentiated into 
glomerular cells, endothelial cells, and tubular epithelial cells.
The large number of BMC-derived interstitial cells, especially 
myofibroblasts, suggests the involvement of BMCs in fibrosis.

This is in agreement with the report by Iwano et al. that BMCs 
can differentiate into renal interstitial fibroblast (22). Renal IRI is 
accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, and the inflamma￾tion subsides after 10 days (42). Hematopoietic stem cell mobiliza￾tion–associated granulocytosis can worsen acute renal failure in 
mice (43). The long-term consequence of allograft bone marrow 
transplantation in mice with IRI is not clear and may warrant fur￾ther investigation. Our study calls for caution in premature clini￾cal use of BMCs in the treatment of renal failure.
Methods
Renal IRI, bone marrow transplantation, and BUN level measurement. Six- to 
8-week-old female C57BL/6NCr or creksp;Z/EG mice were irradiated with 
9.0 Gy of γ-irradiation in 2 divided doses, 2 hours apart, on the day of sur￾gery. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the left renal pedicles 
were clamped with vascular clamps for 45 minutes, which was followed by 
clamp release to allow reperfusion. Right nephrectomy was performed in 
some mice. Sham-operated mice underwent the same procedures except 
for clamping of the renal vessels. BMCs were isolated from the femur and 
tibia of male C57BL/6 or B6-Ly5.2/Cr mice by flushing with Iscove’s mini￾mal essential medium (IMEM). Mice were injected with 0.2 ml IMEM with 
or without 1 × 106 BMCs via tail veins at 2 hours after surgery. Mice were 
kept in a specific pathogen–free facility and were given drinking water con￾taining enrofoxacin (0.15 mg/ml) and amoxicillin (1 mg/ml) for 2 weeks 
to prevent infection. Some mice were given 50 µg/g BrdU or saline at 0.1 
ml i.p. for 14 days. After whole-body perfusion via the left ventricle with 30 
ml PBS to remove the blood, the kidneys were harvested and processed for 
cryosections or paraffin sections as described previously (16). Blood was 
obtained via retro-orbital puncture, and BUN levels were measured using 
a Reflotron analyzer (Roche Diagnostic Corp.). All experiments were per￾formed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Research 
Advisory Committee, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at 
Dallas, Dallas, Texas, USA.
Y chromosome FISH analysis. The mouse Y chromosome painting probe 
was generated by degenerate oligonucleotide–primed PCR using a DNA 
template kindly provided by Diane Krause (Yale University, New Haven, 
Connecticut, USA) and labeled with digoxigenin by nick translation, as 
described previously (44). Y chromosome FISH analysis was performed on 
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded kidney sections (4 µm in thickness) 
using methods described previously (27). Cy-3–conjugated mouse anti￾digoxigenin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used to visualize 
Y chromosome signals. Kidneys from normal male and female mice that 
did not receive male BMC injection were used to test the sensitivity and 
specificity of Y chromosome FISH analysis, respectively. The sensitivity was 
determined by calculating the number of Y chromosome–positive nuclei 
divided by total nuclei [(Y+ nuclei ÷ total nuclei) × 100%].
Immunohistochemistry. Immunostaining was performed on paraffin sec￾tions (4 µm in thickness) as described previously (16). Briefly, the kidney 
sections were incubated at 4°C overnight with antibodies to GFP (1:00; 
Invitrogen Corp.), BrdU (1:2.5; BD), Pax2 (1:50; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), 
vimentin (1:100; Chemicon International), p21 (1:200; Upstate), PCNA 
(1:00; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), pan-cytokeratin (1:500; Dako￾Cytomation), AQP3 (1:400; Chemicon International), CD45 (1:50; CALTAG 
Laboratories), Wt1 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), α-SMA (1:400; 
Sigma-Aldrich), ZO-1 (1:100, Upstate), THP (1:100; John Hoyer, Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) (45), TSC (1:00; 
Mark Knepper, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.) (46). After washing, the 
kidney sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at 
room temperature. Secondary antibodies included Alexa Fluor 488–conju￾gated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated 
goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 350–conjugatedgoat anti-mouse IgG 
(1:400; Invitrogen Corp.). Some kidney sections were incubated with bio￾tinylated anti-rat or anti-goat IgG followed by avidin-fluorescein (1:400; 
Vector Laboratories). Lectin staining was performed by incubation at room 
temperature for 2 hours with FITC-labeled LTA (1:50), DBA(1:40), or TEL 
(1:50) obtained from Vector Laboratories. The nuclei were counterstained 
with DAPI prior to visualization and photography under epifluorescence 
illumination using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Images were merged and 
analyzed using OpenLab software version 3.1.7. 
Flow cytometry analysis of CD45.1 cells. Peripheral blood was collected via 
puncture of the retro-orbital vein. Red blood cells were lysed with 0.84% 
NH4Cl. The nucleated blood cells were incubated with FITC-coupled anti￾CD45.1 antibody (1:1,000; BD Biosciences — Pharmingen) and analyzed 
with flow cytometry (FACScan; BD).
Quantification and statistics. For quantification of immunostaining and Y 
chromosome FISH analysis, 10 fields (×630) from cortex and 10 fields (×630) 
from medulla were randomly selected for counting. Each immunostaining 
and Y chromosome FISH analysis was duplicated, and the values for quan￾tification were averaged. The number of animals used is indicated for 
each individual experiment. Data are represented as mean ± SE. Student’s 
t test was performed using 2-tailed distribution. P < 0.05 was considered to 
be statistically significant.
