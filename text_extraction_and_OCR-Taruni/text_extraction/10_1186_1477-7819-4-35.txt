Abstract
Background: Neuroendocrine tumours frequently metastasize to the liver. Although generally
slowly progressing, hepatic metastases are the major cause of carcinoid syndrome and ultimately
lead to liver dysfunction, cardiac insufficiency and finally death.
Methods: A literature review was performed to define the optimal treatment strategy and work￾up in patients with neuroendocrine hepatic metastases. Based on this, an algorithm for the
management of these patients was established.
Results: Platelet serotonin and chromogranin A are useful biomarkers for detection and follow￾up of neuroendocrine tumour. Helical computed tomography and somatostatin receptor
scintigraphy are the most sensitive diagnostic modalities. Surgical debulking is an accepted approach
for reducing hormonal symptoms and to establish better conditions for medical treatment, but is
frequently impossible due to the extent of disease. A novel approach is the local ablation of tumour
by thermal coagulation using therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or laser induced
thermotherapy (LITT). These techniques preserve normal liver tissue. There is a tendency to
destroy metastases early in the course of disease, thereby postponing or eliminating the surgically
untreatable stage. This can be combined with postoperative radioactive octreotide to eliminate
small multiple metastases. In patients with extensive metastases who are not suitable for local
destruction, systemic therapy by octreotide, 131I-MIBG treatment or targeted chemo- and
radiotherapy should be attempted. A final option for selective patients is orthotopic liver
transplantation.
Conclusion: Treatment for patients with neuroendocrine hepatic metastases must be tailored for
each individual patient. When local ablative therapies are used early in the course of the disease,
the occurrence of carcinoid syndrome with end stage hepatic disease can be postponed or
prevented.

Background
Carcinoids are neuroendocrine tumours that arise from
neoplastic proliferation of enterochromaffin or Kulchit￾sky cells [1]. In 1963, carcinoids were classified according
to their embryologic site of origin as foregut carcinoids
(respiratory tract, stomach, duodenum, biliary system and
pancreas), midgut carcinoids (small intestine, appendix,
cecum, and proximal colon), and hindgut carcinoids (dis￾tal colon and rectum) [2]. According to the WHO classifi￾cation in 2000, distinction was made between well￾differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (benign behav￾iour or uncertain malignant potential, <2% Ki67 positive
cells), well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas
(low grade malignancy, presence of metastasis and/or
invasiveness), and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine
carcinomas of high-grade malignancy (usually small cell,
>15% Ki67 positive cells) [3]. Ki67 is an immunohisto￾chemical biomarker for cell proliferation.
Neuroendocrine hepatic metastases represent about 10%
of all hepatic metastatic neoplasm's [4]. These metastases
occur in about 25–90% of patients with neuroendocrine
tumours. Although these tumours run a rather indolent
course, the 5-year survival of patients with neuroendo￾crine tumours and liver metastases is 40% compared with
75–99% in those free of liver metastases [5-7]. Neuroen￾docrine liver metastases often progress slowly but may
cause significant symptoms due to their size and/or hor￾mone production. Ultimately the hepatic tissue is
replaced by tumour, causing mechanical pressure to sur￾rounding tissues, liver dysfunction, cardiac failure and
finally death. Manifestations of the carcinoid syndrome
usually occur in patients with liver metastases due to pro￾duction and release of serotonin directly in the blood
stream. Classically, the carcinoid syndrome is character￾ised by episodic flushing, tachycardia, diarrhoea and
bronchospasm [8]. Treatment of neuroendocrine hepatic
metastases is aiming at symptomatic improvement and
reduction of hormonal hypersecretion by elimination of
the tumour. However, the most effective management
and timing of treatment remains unclear [9,10]. Here, we
have reviewed the literature and used our own experience
to provide a balanced guideline for imaging and manage￾ment of patients with neuroendocrine hepatic metastases.
Biochemical diagnosis
Neuroendocrine tumours of the small intestine produce
large quantities of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine),
reflected in raised levels of platelet serotonin and a high
urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
[11,12]. The platelet serotonin concentration is more sen￾sitive in the detection of carcinoid tumours than urinary
5-HIAA, particularly in tumours with relatively low serot￾onin production [13,14]. Circulating free serotonin is
removed very rapidly and effectively by the liver. In con￾trast to urinary 5-HIAA, platelet serotonin is not effected
by serotonin-containing diet [15]. Hence platelet serot￾onin is the most discriminating marker for detection of
most neuroendocrine tumours. However, in hindgut car￾cinoids, hydroxylase and decarboxylase are absent and no
serotonin is produced.
Plasma chromogranin A (CgA) has been claimed the most
sensitive and specific marker of tumour volume [16]. CgA
is a precursor for several peptides and is stored in secretory
granules of neuroendocrine tissue [17]. Circulating CgA
allows early detection of persistent or recurrent neuroen￾docrine tumours [18]. The highest CgA levels were noted
in metastatic midgut lesions [19].
Both tumour markers, platelet serotonin and CgA, can be
reliably used for diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumour and
for monitoring the outcome of treatment in individual
patients.
Work-up of patients with neuroendocrine 
hepatic metastases
Several imaging modalities are available to detect hepatic
metastases and their primary neuroendocrine tumours.
Conventional ultrasonography (US), computed tomogra￾phy (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and soma￾tostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) are the cornerstones
for the localisation of neuroendocrine tumours with sen￾sitivities of respectively 46%, 42%, 43% and 90% [20-23].
The use of helical computed tomography (hCT) has
increased the diagnostic sensitivity in the localisation of
both primary (94%) and metastatic tumour (lymph node
69%, liver 94%) [24]. As somatostatin receptor subtype 2
is present in almost 80% of neuroendocrine tumours,
binding 111Indium-labelled octreotide can be used for
both disease staging and to indicate whether or not soma￾tostatin analogues can be used in the treatment of these
tumours [25]. SRS is very helpful in detecting bone and
lung metastases and thereby aids in confirming or refuting
the presence of extrahepatic disease. Based on these con￾siderations, both hCT and SRS should be performed in all
patients prior to treatment.
Treatment modalities
Surgical resection
Surgical resection is to be considered when no extrahe￾patic disease is present. Hemihepatectomy or segmental
resection is feasible when metastases are solitary and
resection can be radical with enough functional liver tis￾sue remaining. Symptomatic response rates have been
reported to be 90% for a mean duration of 19.3 months
after surgical resection [26]. Unfortunately, neuroendo￾crine metastases are usually multiple and diffuse and
therefore resection is often impossible. Furthermore, in
most patients treated by surgical resection with curative

(page number not for citation purposes)
intent, additional metastases develop that presumably
were occult at the time of surgery [26]. Therefore even in
resectable cases, liver tissue sparing therapies should be
considered, allowing future repeated treatment.
Local ablative therapy
Local therapy using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or
laser induced thermotherapy (LITT) is a well-established
treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas and
liver metastases from colorectal carcinomas [27,28]. A few
small series and case reports have also shown good
response in neuroendocrine hepatic metastases [29-33].
Up until now, a disadvantage of these therapies has been
the relatively small volume of tissue that can be coagu￾lated. Clinical trials with RFA have shown that complete
tumour eradication is more likely to occur with small
tumours, i.e. diameter ≤ 4 cm, than with large tumours
[34]. With the use of simultaneous multiple fiber LITT or
next generation bipolar RFA, we have been able to ablate
tumours as large as 7 cm in diameter [35] (Figure 1). Fur￾thermore, up to 7 lesions at one time may be ablated
using specialized techniques to increase lesion size [36]. It
has been reported that cytoreduction of ≥ 90% is adequate
for durable symptomatic relief [9]. In our most recent
strategy, we aim at complete destruction of the intrahe￾patic tumour to prevent the occurrence of surgically
untreatable disease. The largest reported study of 34
patients with neuroendocrine hepatic metastases treated
with RFA showed symptom relief in 95% of these patients
with significant or complete symptom control in 80%, for
a mean of 10 months [29]. Even in patients with extrahe￾patic disease and liver metastases ablation may also pro￾vide symptom relief [29]. The complication rate is 5–10%
and the mortality rate is about 0.5% [37-39]. Therefore
these techniques are especially suitable for repeated treat￾ment in patients in which local recurrence or new metas￾tases developing during follow up.
All invasive procedures during surgery such as liver resec￾tion and ablation and even anaesthesia can induce hor￾mone release and even provoke a life-threatening
carcinoid crisis [40]. In the severe crisis of carcinoid syn￾drome the flush is usually accompanied by hypotension
and occasionally shock. Injection of octreotide, the long￾acting analog of somatostatin, usually prevents or aborts
this vasomotor reaction [41]. Studies have shown that the
use of octreotide intraoperatively for patients with meta￾static carcinoid tumours undergoing surgery with manip￾ulation of tumour is associated with a decreased
frequency of intraoperative complications [42,43].
Arterial embolisation
Hepatic arterial embolisation with or without chemother￾apy is a palliative option for those unresectable lesions in
which the predominant mass of tumour is localised in
one of the liver lobes. In the past, more radical blunt tech￾niques to occlude the main hepatic artery were used.
However, recently, superselective techniques have
become available with the advantage of leaving the main
segmental arteries open. Contraindications of hepatic
arterial embolisation include complete portal vein occlu￾sion, hepatic failure and previous biliary anastomoses

[44]. Symptomatic improvement after hepatic arterial
embolisation is reported to occur in 64–90% [45,46].
Reports on chemoembolisation show a slight better bio￾chemical response and tumour response than hepatic
artery embolisation [47]. Embolisation techniques are
associated with mortality rates of about 5% and almost all
patients develop the 'postembolic syndrome' (elevated
liver function tests and fever) although mostly transient
and in different grades of severity [48-50]. In addition,
serious complications have occurred in about 10% of
patients treated with hepatic embolisation for neuroendo￾crine tumours [51]. Complications can be reduced by pro￾phylactic octreotide infusion during the procedure and
the use of forced diuresis during and after the embolisa￾tion. In case of partial or no response, supplementary
embolisation or additional RFA or LITT could be an
option. In selected cases with good response to embolisa￾tion a partial hepatic resection may be considered.
Pharmacological therapy
Pharmacological therapy consists of long-lasting octre￾otide injections, Iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
(131I-MIBG), interferon-α (IFN-α) or targeted chemo- and
radiotherapy. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue and
appears to be an efficacious treatment for carcinoid syn￾drome, reducing symptoms in more than 70% of patients
[52,53]. Some patients with partial response after local
ablation have relief of symptoms by additional treatment
with octreotide [37]. Prolonged symptomatic relief can be
provided by 131I-MIBG therapy. In individual cases,
improved quality of life may be obtained [54]. Even
improved survival was seen by symptomatic response to
131I-MIBG treatment [55]. The clinical benefit of IFN-α
treatment has been limited by their modest anti-tumour
effect as well as serious side-effects [56,57]. In addition,
combination treatment with octreotide and IFN-α
showed little advantage. Biochemical responses were
observed in 72–77%, however no objective tumour
regression was observed [57,58]. A promising approach is
the concept of somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-mediated
chemo-or radiotherapy of SSTR-expressing metastatic car￾cinoid. Currently, clinical trials with cytotoxic com￾pounds, such as methotrexate and doxorubicin, linked to
an analog of somotostatin are under way [59,60]. Also
promising is targeted SSRT-mediated radiotherapy using
radionuclides such as 90Y and 177Lu. Experimental studies
in patients who have somatostatin-positive tumours show
complete remission by the use of tetra-azacyclododecane
tetra-acetic acid Tyr3-octreotide [61]. After surgical reduc￾tion of tumour load, repeated intermediate-dosage 90Y,
Tyr-octreotide, 177Lu or 131I-MIBG treatment appears to be
a reliable and well-tolerated radionuclide therapy and
might be a useful adjunct in patients with malignant neu￾roendocrine carcinoma, providing long-lasting palliation
and prolonged survival [62].
Liver transplantation
Young patients with surgically unresectable tumours,
hepatomegaly and uncontrollable symptoms, in whom
all other therapies have been unsuccessful, may benefit
from liver transplantation [63]. However, liver transplan￾tation for metastatic disease is controversial and in most
cases even contraindicated, as the results have been poor
due to complex operative procedures [64-66]. Well differ￾entiated tumours and a low proliferation rate
(Ki67<10%) are important selection criteria [67]. Overall,
post-operative mortality of 19% is reported in a group of
31 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation
for metastatic neuroendocrine tumours [65]. In the same
study, 50% of the carcinoid patients suffered from one or
more major complications i.e. peritoneal bleeding, acute/
chronic rejection and acute pancreatitis [65].
Conclusion
Hepatic metastases are frequently encountered in patients
with digestive endocrine tumours and their presence plays
an important role in quality of life and overall prognosis.
Tailored multimodality treatment is the key to increase
survival and achieve good palliation in patients with

hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumours. A flow
sheet such as presented in figure 2 can be helpful in the
decision of choice of treatment. Determination of platelet
serotonin and plasma CgA is useful for detection of neu￾roendocrine tumour and to evaluate therapy efficiency.
Visualisation of neuroendocrine hepatic metastases
should be performed by hCT/MRI and SRS. Determina￾tion of platelet serotonin and plasma CgA is useful for
detection of neuroendocrine tumour and to evaluate ther￾apy efficiency. The proliferation marker Ki67 is a very
important tool in guiding the type of treatment. Surgery is
the treatment of choice for hepatic metastases however
cure is frequently impossible due to the extent of disease.
Treatment aimed at cytoreduction of hepatic metastasis
and diminished secretion of bioactive amines may
achieve good palliation. Tumour destruction by RFA or
LITT provides a novel liver preserving option. These tech￾niques will now be used more often as liver preserving
option to treat patients early in the course of their disease
postponing drug intervention and preventing the end
stage carcinoid syndrome and thereby improving life
expectancy.
