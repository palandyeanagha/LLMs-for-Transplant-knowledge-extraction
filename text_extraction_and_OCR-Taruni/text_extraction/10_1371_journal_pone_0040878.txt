Abstract
The ratio between apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I (apoB/apoA-I) has been suggested to be a powerful and more
accurate predictor of future cardiovascular disease risk than total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Since diet and lifestyle
can directly influence dyslipidemia, it is of interest to identify modifiable factors that are associated with high levels of the
apolipoprotein ratio and if they can have a different association with a more traditional indicator of cardiovascular risk such
as total cholesterol/HDL. The relationship between obesity and dyslipidemia is established and it is of interest to determine
which factors can modify this association. This study investigated the cross-sectional association of obesity, diet and lifestyle
factors with apoB/apoA-I and total cholesterol/HDL respectively, in a Swedish population of 2,907 subjects (1,537 women)
as part of the INTERGENE study. The apolipoprotein and lipoprotein ratios were highly correlated, particularly in women,
and obesity was strongly associated with both. Additionally, age, cigarette smoking and alcohol intake were important
determinants of these ratios. Alcohol was the only dietary factor that appreciably attenuated the association between
obesity and each of the ratios, with a stronger attenuation in women. Other dietary intake and lifestyle-related factors such
as smoking status and physical activity had a lower effect on this association. Because the apolipoprotein and lipoprotein
ratios share similar diet and lifestyle determinants as well as being highly correlated, we conclude that either of these ratios
may be a sufficient indicator of dyslipidemia.

Introduction
Dyslipidemia, in terms of elevated LDL and triglycerides as
well as decreased HDL concentrations, is independently linked
to the progression of CVD [1]. However, it has recently been
suggested that apolipoproteins (apo) may be more informative
risk markers than lipoproteins (e.g. LDL and HDL) [2],
particularly, the ratio between apolipoprotein B and apolipo￾protein A-I (apoB/apoA-I) [3–5] [6]. The measurement error of
apolipoproteins is ,5% [7,8] and they are stable in acute stroke
[9] while not more expensive to measure than traditional
lipoproteins. However the apolipoprotein superiority was not
confirmed in all studies [10] and was questioned by some recent
important studies such as the Women’s Health Initiative [11],
the EPIC-Norfolk [12,13] and the PREVEND cohort [14].
Obesity (defined as BMI $30) is a well-established factor
associated with higher levels of apolipoprotein ratio [15], while
alcohol intake and regular physical exercise are inversely related
to the apolipoprotein ratio [16].
On these premises, the aim of the present study was to identify
lifestyle-related correlates of this ratio and potential differences in
relation to the more conventional total cholesterol/HDL ratio.
Among the investigated lifestyle factors, we focused on obesity,
which in contrast to many other cardiovascular risk factors
increased sharply in Sweden at the end of the 20th century [17]. In
particular, we examined whether any dietary factor could explain
the known associations between obesity and either of these ratios
and we tested any effect modification by triglycerides on the
association between obesity and both ratios. The study population
was composed of Swedish adults sampled within the INTER￾GENE cohort study.
Methods
Subjects and Dietary Assessment
INTERGENE is a population based research program that
aimed to assess the INTERplay between GENEtic susceptibility
and environmental factors for the risk of chronic diseases in

western Sweden. The survey started in April 2001 and continued
until December 2004. The study population consisted of randomly
selected women and men aged 25–74 years living in the Va¨ stra
Go¨taland Region at the time of sampling. Of 8,820 individuals
invited to participate in the study, 194 were found to be deceased,
had moved to another part of Sweden, to another country or had
an unknown address. Of the remaining 8,626 eligible individuals,
3,614 (1,915 women) participated yielding a participation rate of
42%. Participants were more likely to be women, of higher age
and with a higher education level than non-participants [18]. Due
to exclusions described below, the final sample used in this analysis
included 2,907 subjects (1,537 women).
Body height and weight were measured to the nearest 1 cm and
0.1 kg, respectively, while the subjects were wearing light clothing
and no shoes. Waist circumference was measured at a level
midway between the lower rib margin and iliac crest, and hip
circumference was measured as the maximum perimeter over the
buttocks. 117 subjects had missing values for waist circumference
and were thus excluded from the analyses.
Usual dietary intake was assessed with a validated self-adminis￾tered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) [19,20] adapted to the
INTERGENE cohort [21] and including 92 frequency questions, 72
of which (including alcoholic drinks) had a choice of 8 intake
frequencies ranging from no consumptiontothree or more occasions
per day. For the remaining 20 foods (such as milk and yoghurt with
differentfat content, beverages otherthan alcoholic beverages, sugar,
cheeseand bread of differenttypes), open questionsaboutthe number
of servings (e.g. glasses of milk or juice, cups of tea/coffee, slices of
cheese or bread, spoons of sugar) per day or week were included.
Missing values for foodfrequencies were considered equivalenttothe
indication of no consumptionforthat specificfood itemandwerethus
set to a 0 intake level. Intakes of foods in grams were calculated by
multiplying the frequency of consumption of each food item by
gender- and age-specific portion sizes [19]. In turn, nutrient and
energy intake were estimated by multiplying these values with
nutrient content from the Swedish Food Administration Database
(1997). Due to implausible energy intake, 155 subjects were excluded
from the present analysis. Moreover, 71 subjects were also excluded
because they did not fill in the Food Frequency Questionnaire or
becausethe number ofmissingvaluesforfoodfrequencieswasgreater
than eight.
The Recommended Food Score (RFS) was calculated as
described in another Swedish cohort [22] that used the same
validated questionnaire later adapted to the INTERGENE cohort
(see above [19–21]). The RFS is derived from the separation of
‘‘healthier’’ from ‘‘less healthy’’ foods based on their nutrient
content, indications from dietary guidelines [23] and results from
large epidemiological studies. It includes plant-based food items
(fruit, vegetables, nuts), low-fat milk and yoghurt, whole grain
bread, crispbreads (high fibre content, no fat) and fish (excluding
shellfish). When each recommended food item was consumed 1–2
times per week or more, 1 point was assigned. The final score
added up to a maximum of 40 and, in the present analyses, was
included on a scale of 10 points.
The questionnaire also included information about health,
socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors. Based on these, 7 subjects were
excluded because of pregnancy and189 subjects because they were
taking statins at enrolment. Physical activity was assessed by means of
a validated questionnaire [24] that has been in use in Gothenburg
since the 1960s [25]. Each subject was asked to report their physical
activity during leisure time, choosing between: 1. Mostly sedentary
activitiesi.e. reading andwatchingTV, 2. Moderateactivities such as
walking and cycling ($4 h/week), 3. Moderate activities ($5 h/
week) or 4. hard training and competitive sports. The subjects were
also asked to report their activity level during working time, choosing
between: 1.Mostly sedentary, 2. Passive sitting half of time, 3.Mostly
standing, 4. Mostly walking/lifting (minor carrying), 5. Mostly
walking/lifting (major carrying), 6. Heavy manual labour. PAL
values were assessed based on assumed intensity levels of different
activities (ratio of work metabolic rate to resting metabolic rate) [26].
Sex-specific PAL quintiles were finally calculated and included in the
statistical models.
Laboratory Analyses
Blood tests were taken at different times of the day on subjects
fasting for at least four hours and the blood samples were collected
into tubes containing 0.1% EDTA for immediate serum lipid
analyses. Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations
were determined using enzymatic assays. HDL cholesterol
concentration was measured after dextran sulfate-magnesium
precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Quantitative de￾termination of apoB and apoA-I was done by immunoprecipita￾tion enhanced by polyethylene glycol at 340 nm (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Vantaa, Finland). The analyses were performed on
a Konelab 20 auto-analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Inter-assay
coefficient of variation was below 5% for Konelab analyses. 166
subjects were excluded from the analyses because of missing
apoB/apoA-I ratio and 2 because of outlier values for this ratio.
Statistical Analyses
The association between apolipoprotein and lipoprotein ratios
was assessed by linear regression analysis separately for men and
women as well as in the whole data set including an interaction
term with sex. The correlation and 95% Confidence Intervals
(95% CIs) between BMI or central adiposity indicators (waist
circumference and WHR) [27] and each ratio were assessed in the
whole population sample, adjusting for sex. Logistic regression
models adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, physical activity,
marital status and menopausal status plus estrogen use in women
were used to test the statistical interaction between both ratios and
triglycerides levels, including obesity as the outcome variable.
Higher and lower triglyceride levels were also defined according to
sex-specific medians and stratified estimates were produced, of the
association between obesity and the ratio(s) whose effect was
modified by triglycerides.
Multiple linear regression was used to investigate the association
between each of the two ratios and age (linearly included on a scale of
10 years), smoking status (current smokers vs non smokers), physical
activity (expressed as sex-specific quintiles of the PAL index), marital
status (married or living with partner vs all other categories),
education (lower education levels vs higher levels) and menopausal
status plus estrogen use in women (post-menopausal women not
taking estrogens compared with both post-menopausal women
taking estrogens and premenopausalwomentaking estrogens or not),
and diet. The latter was investigated both at the food and at the
macronutrient level.Atthefood levelwetestedthe association of both
ratios with the Recommended Food Score (included in the model as
a continuous variable, on a scale of 10 points).The association offood
groups and food items relevant in relation to dyslipidemia was also
tested, considering daily intake in grams and adjusting or not for
energy intake. At the nutrient level we investigated the association of
protein, fat, carbohydrate as well as of different macronutrient
subtypes and of ethanol intake, considering daily intake in grams. All
variables were included in the models on a continuous scale, divided
by 10 in order to get an estimation of the association with an intake
increase of 10 g/day. [28]. Ethanol intake was investigated either as
a continuous variable (total or beverage-specific intake on a 10 g/day
basis) or as a categorical variable based on population-specific tertiles

(0.32–4.57 g/day; 4.58–9.78 g/day; .9.78 g/day) including ab￾stainers as the fourth category. Analyses were performed both on the
whole dataset (adjusting for sex) and separately for men and women.
Natural logarithms of the ratios were used in these models in order to
meet the normality assumption of linear regression and reduce
skewness.
The parameter estimates from linear regression of log-ratio on
predicting variables (b) were presented as percent difference in the
outcome for an increase of each covariate by 1 unit (dietary
macronutrients were scaled to 10 g/day):
% difference in apoB ð Þ =apoA{I or tot ð Þ : cholesterol=HDL
~½  expð Þ b 1 .100
To show the influence of individual covariates (see above) on the
association between obesity and each of the two ratios, we
calculated how much the regression parameter for obesity adjusted
for the covariate (bobesity|confounder) differed from the regression
parameter for obesity in the unadjusted model (bobesity):
Attenuation Factor AF ð Þ
~100. bobesitybobesityDconfounder  = bobesity    
The AF was computed separately for each covariate, and
including all confounding variables together in the same model.
Positive AF values indicate that the covariate added to the model
explains part of the association between obesity and outcome,
while negative values indicate that it enhances the association of
obesity on outcome, e.g. if the confounder had opposite
associations with obesity and outcome.
Finally, sensitivity analyses included adjusting for energy intake
(estimated based on macronutrient multiplied by Atwater factors)
and the exclusion of subjects reporting previous cardiovascular
events or diabetes and subjects abstaining from alcohol consump￾tion where applicable.

quintile: 1.30–1.50 in men, 1–35–1.50 in women; range of the
highest quintile: 1.90–2.40 in men, 1.90–2.35 in women). Mean
ethanol intake among consumers was 9.168.2 g/day, with men
reporting twice as much ethanol as women (12.169.7 g/day vs
6.164.9 g/day), while the proportion of abstainers among women
was twice that of men. The Recommended Food Score was 2
points lower in men than in women. The latter had higher values
of HDL-cholesterol than men and a lower ratio of total cholesterol
over HDL-cholesterol (3.261.0 in women vs 4.061.2 in men).
Similarly, the apolipoprotein ratio was higher in men (0.8160.23)
than in women (0.6660.21).
The two ratios were highly correlated (coefficient of de￾termination: R2= 0.87 in men, 0.91 in women, Figure 1) and
this correlation was higher in women than in men (p-value for
interaction ,0.0001), both when excluding or including an outlier
in the male cohort characterized by a high lipoprotein ratio
coupled to a low apolipoprotein ratio.
Association of apoB/apoA-I and Total Cholesterol/HDL
Ratios with Diet, Lifestyle and Reproductive Factors
The Recommended Food Score was inversely associated with
both outcomes, but significantly in women only. Analyses at food
level for one food item at a time, adjusted for age, smoking status,
physical activity, marital status and menopausal status plus
estrogen use in women, showed that two food groups were
consistently associated with both ratios in men and women:
sweetened products and alcoholic drinks. The former were
positively associated with the difference in apolipoprotein ratio
(0.4%, 95% CI: 0.1; 0.8 in men and 0.8%, 95% CI: 0.3; 1.4 in
women) as well as with the difference in lipoprotein ratio (0.4%,
95% CI: 0.0; 0.8 in men and 0.8%, 95% CI: 0.3; 1.3 in women).
On the other hand, alcoholic beverages were inversely associated
with the difference in apolipoprotein ratio (21.1%, 95% CI: 21.7;
20.6 in men and 23.0%, 95% CI: 24.3; 21.7 in women) and in
lipoprotein ratio (21.1%, 95% CI: 21.7; 20.5 in men and
21.9%, 95% CI: 23.1; 20.5 in women). The analyses at
macronutrient level summarized the above mentioned results,
since sucrose and ethanol intake were associated with both ratios
in men and women. Saturated fats showed a slight but significant
inverse association with only the apolipoprotein ratio in women.
Although it is not possible to compare all factors on a common
scale, Table 2 summarizes the results of a model including
different dietary, lifestyle and, in women, reproductive factors, in
association with both ratios. For diet we included those variables
that in the above mentioned analyses were significantly associated
with either ratio, i.e. sucrose and ethanol intake as well as the
Recommended Food Score. Saturated fats were also included,
considering their a priori known relevance as a dietary cardiovas￾cular risk factor. The multivariate results, when RFS, sucrose,
saturated fats and alcohol were included in the model at the same
time, confirmed what was observed in the above mentioned
analyses where each of these factors was singularly tested.
Other significant positive associations were found for cigarette
smoking, for the highest (vs. the lowest) sex-specific quintile of
physical activity in men and for living with a partner (vs not) in
women. In women, lower ratio levels were observed in pre￾menopausal women taking estrogens compared to post-meno￾pausal women who did not take estrogens (the reference category).
Notably, BMI showed a very strong positive association with both
ratios.
Role of Different Factors in Explaining the Association
between Obesity and Both Ratios
Table 3 shows how different factors related to cardiovascular
risk could individually attenuate the association observed between
obesity and both ratios. In men, the highest attenuation factors
were observed for age and ethanol intake (both ratios) as well for
diet (lipoprotein ratio only), while in women the highest

attenuation factors were observed for age, reproductive variables
and ethanol intake, for both ratios. The overall attenuation
exercised by all factors together was equal to 13.2% (apolipopro￾tein ratio) and 11.2% (lipoprotein ratio) in men and 28.5%
(apolipoprotein ratio) and 21.5% (lipoprotein ratio) in women.
In logistic regression models testing the association between
both ratios and obesity, a statistically significant interaction
between triglycerides and the lipoprotein ratio was found in men
and women combined, showing a stronger association of the
lipoprotein ratio and obesity at lower triglyceride levels defined
according the sex-specific median (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.26; 2.21
at lower triglyceride levels; OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.29; 1.63 at
higher levels).
Association with Ethanol and Alcoholic Beverages
Total ethanol intake was inversely related with both outcomes
in all analyses, with a stronger association in women (p-value for
interaction ,0.001 for both ratios) (Table 4). The inverse
association between both ratios and ethanol intake was mainly
explained by consumption of wine in women and of beer and wine
in men (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4). In spite of lower prevalence and lower
absolute consumption, ethanol from spirits was found to reduce
the apolipoprotein ratio in women but not in men. A decreasing
trend of the mean values of (log)apolipoprotein ratio with
increasing ethanol intake categories (adjusted for age and BMI)
was more pronounced in women than in men (p-value for
interaction = 0.04) (Figure 2). No gender difference in the effect of
BMI on apolipoprotein ratio were found when ethanol was taken
into account.
Moreover, total ethanol intake was positively associated with
apoA-I in both men and women and inversely associated with
apoB in women. In contrast, no association was found for total
cholesterol while HDL was positively associated with ethanol
intake (see Table S1).
No interaction between ethanol intake and smoking status was
found and the adjusted means of both ratios were consistent
between ever and never smokers across different ethanol intake
levels (Table S2).
Sensitivity Analyses
The main analyses were repeated and the results confirmed
after excluding subjects reporting previous cardiovascular events
or diabetes (N = 70). Results on ethanol and alcoholic drinks were
unaffected after excluding abstainers (N = 269) or after adjusting
for energy intake (kcal/day).
Discussion
In this analysis we sought to identify possible differences in
dietary and lifestyle factors associated with the apoB/apoA-I ratio
in comparison to the total cholesterol/HDL ratio. The apolipo￾protein and lipoprotein ratios were highly correlated (R2= 0.9)
and indeed, they showed similar correlates. In other studies, the
correlation with the lipoprotein ratio was not as high as in this

study [2] or the apolipoprotein ratio was compared with that of
non-HDL cholesterol/HDL and not with the more appropriate
total cholesterol/HDL ratio [4].
BMI was a strong modifiable risk factor for high values of both
ratios but notably, with the exception of alcohol, dietary intake
played no, or only a minor influence on the association between
obesity and both ratios and was in itself only marginally related to
them. Additionally, none of the potential confounders we studied
could explain the association between obesity and the two ratios,
in line with the well-known fact that obesity is an independent risk
factor for atherosclerosis [29]. The only difference we found was
an effect modification by triglycerides on the association between
obesity and the lipoprotein but not the apolipoprotein ratio, with
a stronger association at lower triglyceride values. Our data
suggest that in obese subjects, most dietary and lifestyle features
reported in questionnaires are uninformative determinants as such
of increased levels of either the apolipoprotein or the lipoprotein
ratio. Alternatively, the correlation between obesity and dietary
habits could have made it impossible to capture any influence of
diet on either the studied outcomes. However, the difference in
diet quality between obese and non-obese was very low (,1 on
a scale of 40 in the RFS), indicating that the above mentioned
result was not explained by the difference in diet quality captured
by the RFS. The same can be stated for physical activity, since no
significant difference in activity levels emerged comparing the
obese with the rest of the population. On the other hand, we
acknowledge that it is equally possible that other measuring tools
which are more accurate and more resistant to reporting bias in
obese compared to food frequency questionnaires are needed.
Ethanol was found to be an important exception, being inversely
and strongly associated with both ratios, as well as being able to
reduce the intensity of the association between obesity and both
ratios, although it was not assessed with more detail than other
single diet components assessed by the FFQ. Alcoholic drinks are
expected to be more frequently underreported than overreported
as the intakes get higher and this would be more likely to produce
a weaker association, while in our study the association between
ethanol and both ratios was strong and significant. On the other
hand, obesity can also be considered a potential confounding
factor related to both exposure (ethanol) as well as to dyslipidemia.
Obese subjects had lower alcohol intake compared to non-obese
subjects and due to the increased adiposity, they are expected to
have a lower water-to-fat ratio than leaner subjects and thus need
to drink less to achieve a given ethanol concentration sufficient to
influence blood lipid levels. In our study sample alcohol intake was
related to both the outcome (apo) and the exposure (BMI .30).
The association of ethanol with both ratios was not influenced by
total energy intake and, relevantly, the association was more
pronounced in women than in men. For apolipoprotein, this result
could be due to the observation that in women ethanol intake

influenced both apolipoproteins included in the ratio, while in men
the intake was associated with apolipoprotein B only. Women are
known to metabolize ethanol less efficiently than men and are thus
generally considered at increased risk of alcohol related damage
than men [30]. Moreover, different beverages seemed here to have
differential associations, although the influence of alcoholic
beverages on dyslipidemia and CVD risk have generally been
found to be independent of beverage type [31,32]. Therefore, this

remains an open question [33], also considering that differential
effects related to the beverage type have been observed for other
medical conditions [34]. In particular, the intake of alcohol was
found to be inversely associated with apoB/apoA-I in a study sub￾sample of post-menopausal 64-years old women, two thirds of
whom were diabetic or had impaired glucose tolerance [16].
The present study has both strengths and limitations. Among
the former we list the fact that it is a population-based cohort
including both men and women where weight status, cardiovas￾cular risk factors and dietary intakes have been assessed as
previously documented in detail [35–38]. Other strengths include
the availability of data concerning various potential confounders,
the possibility to capture different aspects of diet and particularly
to discriminate ethanol intake from different beverages, the
availability of both apolipoprotein and lipoprotein measures from
samples collected on the same occasion and finally a sufficient
study population size to allow analyses on men and women
separately. Among the limitations we acknowledge the cross￾sectional design that does not allow inference on possible causative
relationships but only on associations. This could be associated to
a reverse causation bias, particularly in the relationships between
obesity, ethanol intake and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, the diet
data was based on food frequency questionnaires which were semi￾quantitative with regard to quantities consumed and thus likely to
contain obesity-related underreporting. Information bias in
questionnaires on diet and lifestyle is inevitable and can have
partially influenced the calculation of attenuation of diet and
lifestyle variables in modulating the association between obesity
and dyslipidemia. In particular, an underestimation of the effect of
diet and lifestyle on dyslipidemia due to socio-demographic
differences between participants and non-participants is also
possible [18]. Finally, both smoking status and obesity were both
strongly associated with dyslipidemia so we cannot exclude some
residual confounding by these factors.
In conclusion, our study showed that apolipoproteins and
lipoproteins shared common determinants. A positive association
of alcoholic beverages on the lipid profile has also been confirmed
for both ratios and was stronger in women than in men. With the
exception of ethanol, diet played no, or only a minor part, in
explaining the association of obesity with either ratio. A follow up
study on INTERGENE is planned and will give the opportunity to
study more in detail the differences between these two ratios and
their interaction with triglyceride levels on CVD risk.
