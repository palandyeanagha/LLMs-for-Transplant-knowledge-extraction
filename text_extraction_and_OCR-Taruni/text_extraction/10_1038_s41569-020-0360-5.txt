In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused 
by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei prov￾ince, and has spread rapidly throughout China, with an 
ongoing risk of a pandemic1
. After virus identification 
and isolation, the pathogen for this pneumonia was 
originally called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)2
but has subsequently been officially named severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by 
the WHO. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the 
outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern. Compared with the SARS-CoV 
that caused an outbreak of SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 
has a stronger transmission capacity. The rapid increase 
in confirmed cases makes the prevention and control 
of COVID-19 extremely serious. Although the clinical 
manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respira￾tory symptoms, some patients have severe cardiovascular 
damage3
. In addition, some patients with underlying car￾diovascular diseases (CVDs) might have an increased 
risk of death3
. Therefore, understanding the damage 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 to the cardiovascular system 
and the underlying mechanisms is of the greatest impor￾tance, so that treatment of these patients can be timely 
and effective and mortality reduced.
SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane￾bound aminopeptidase that has a vital role in the cardio￾vascular and immune systems4
. ACE2 is involved in 
heart function and the development of hypertension 
and diabetes mellitus. In addition, ACE2 has been 
identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses4
, 
including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 
infection is triggered by binding of the spike protein 
of the virus to ACE2, which is highly expressed in the 
heart and lungs4
. SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades alveo￾lar epithelial cells, resulting in respiratory symptoms. 
These symptoms are more severe in patients with 
CVD, which might be associated with increased secre￾tion of ACE2 in these patients compared with healthy 
individuals. ACE2 levels can be increased by the use of 
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors. Given 
that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the 
safety and potential effects of antihypertension therapy 
with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers in 
patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. 
Whether patients with COVID-19 and hypertension who 
are taking an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor 
blocker should switch to another antihypertensive drug 
remains controversial, and further evidence is required.
Acute cardiac injury
Reports suggest that the Middle East respiratory 
syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause 
acute myocarditis and heart failure5
. SARS-CoV-2 and 
MERS-CoV have similar pathogenicity, and the myo￾cardial damage caused by infection with these viruses 
undoubtedly increases the difficulty and complexity of 
patient treatment. Myocardial injury associated with 
the SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 5 of the first 41 patients 
diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, which mainly 
manifested as an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels (>28 pg/ml)3
. In this study, 
four of five patients with myocardial injury were admit￾ted to the intensive-care unit (ICU), which indicates 
the serious nature of the myocardial injury in patients 
with COVID-19. Blood-pressure levels were signifi￾cantly higher in patients treated in the ICU than in those 
not treated in the ICU (mean systolic blood pressure 
145 mmHg versus 122 mmHg; P < 0.001)3
. In another 
report of 138 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 
36 patients with severe symptoms were treated in the 
ICU1
. The levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury were 
significantly higher in patients treated in the ICU than 
in those not treated in the ICU (median creatine kinase 
(CK)-MB level 18 U/l versus 14 U/l, P<0.001; hs-cTnI 
level 11.0pg/ml versus 5.1pg/ml, P=0.004), suggesting 
that patients with severe symptoms often have compli￾cations involving acute myocardial injury1
. In addition, 
among the confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
reported by the National Health Commission of China 
(NHC), some of the patients first went to see a doctor 
COVID-19 and the cardiovascular 
system

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects host cells through ACE2 
receptors, leading to coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related pneumonia, while also causing 
acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Therefore, particular 
attention should be given to cardiovascular protection during treatment for COVID-19.

because of cardiovascular symptoms. The patients pre￾sented with heart palpitations and chest tightness rather 
than with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough, 
but were later diagnosed with COVID-19. Among the 
people who died from COVID-19 reported by the NHC, 
11.8% of patients without underlying CVD had substan￾tial heart damage, with elevated levels of cTnI or cardiac 
arrest during hospitalization. Therefore, in patients with 
COVID-19, the incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is 
high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and 
immune system disorders during disease progression.
The mechanism of acute myocardial injury caused 
by SARS-CoV-2 infection might be related to ACE2. 
ACE2 is widely expressed not only in the lungs but also 
in the cardiovascular system and, therefore, ACE2-
related signalling pathways might also have a role in 
heart injury. Other proposed mechanisms of myocardial 
injury include a cytokine storm triggered by an imbal￾anced response by type 1 and type 2 T helper cells3,6
, 
and respiratory dysfunction and hypoxaemia caused by 
COVID-19, resulting in damage to myocardial cells.
Chronic cardiovascular damage
A 12-year follow-up survey of 25 patients who recovered 
from SARS-CoV infection found that 68% had hyper￾lipidaemia, 44% had cardiovascular system abnor￾malities and 60% had glucose metabolism disorders7
. 
Metabolomics analysis revealed that lipid metabolism 
was dysregulated in patients with a history of SARS-CoV 
infection. In these patients, the serum concentrations 
of free fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophos￾phatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were 
significantly increased compared with individuals 
without a history of SARS-CoV infection7
. However, the 
mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection leads to dis￾orders of lipid and glucose metabolism are still uncer￾tain. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure to 
SARS-CoV, this novel virus might also cause chronic 
damage to the cardiovascular system, and attention 
should be given to cardiovascular protection during 
treatment for COVID-19.
Patients with pre-existing CVD
A meta-analysis showed that MERS-CoV infection 
was more likely to occur in patients with underlying 
CVD8
. In patients with MERS-CoV infection and severe 
symptoms, 50% had hypertension and diabetes and 
up to 30% had heart disease. Similarly, according to the 
Pneumonitis Diagnosis and Treatment Program for New 
Coronavirus Infection (Trial Version 4), elderly people 
with comorbidities are more likely to be infected with 
SARS-CoV-2, especially those with hypertension, coro￾nary heart disease or diabetes. Furthermore, patients 
with CVD are more likely to develop severe symptoms 
if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, patients with 
CVD account for a large proportion of deaths from 
COVID-19. In one study, among the patients with severe 
symptoms of COVID-19, 58% had hypertension, 25% 
had heart disease and 44% had arrhythmia1
. Accord￾ing to mortality data released by the NHC, 35% of 
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a history 
of hypertension and 17% had a history of coronary 
heart disease. Furthermore, data show that patients aged 
>60 years who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 had 
more systemic symptoms and more severe pneumonia 
than patients aged ≤60 years9
. Therefore, in patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, underlying CVD can aggravate 
the pneumonia and increase the severity of symptoms.
Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are 
infected with SARS-CoV-2 often have a poor prognosis. 
In patients with ACS, cardiac functional reserve can be 
reduced owing to myocardial ischaemia or necrosis. 
When infected with SARS-CoV-2, cardiac insufficiency is 
more likely to occur, leading to a sudden deterioration in 
the condition of these patients. Some of the patients with 
COVID-19in Wuhan had previous ACS, which was asso￾ciated with severe illness and high mortality. For patients 
with cardiac insufficiency who have underlying heart dis￾ease, SARS-CoV-2 infection might act as a precipitating 
factor to worsen the condition and lead to death.
Drug-related heart damage during COVID-19 treat￾ment is a concern. In particular, the use of antiviral 
drugs should be monitored. In a study of 138 patients 
with COVID-19, 89.9% were given antiviral drugs1
. 
However, many antiviral drugs can cause cardiac insuf￾ficiency, arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disorders. 
Therefore, during treatment of COVID-19, especially 
with the use of antivirals, the risk of cardiac toxicity must 
be closely monitored10.
Conclusions
SARS-CoV-2 is thought to infect host cells through ACE2 
to cause COVID-19, while also causing damage to the 
myocardium, although the specific mechanisms are uncer￾tain. Patients with underlying CVD and SARS-CoV-2 
infection have an adverse prognosis. Therefore, particu￾lar attention should be given to cardiovascular protection 
during treatment for COVID-19.
