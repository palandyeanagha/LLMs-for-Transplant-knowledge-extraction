Abstract
Background: Pulmonary is an uncommon site of extramedullary involvement in multiple myeloma (MM). Diffuse
parenchymal amyloidosis as pulmonary manifestation of MM is even rarer. We report a rare case of diffuse parenchymal
pulmonary amyloidosis associated with MM diagnosed by video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy (VATLB).
Case presentation: A 58-year-old woman complained of cough and shortness of breath. HRCT disclosed diffuse
ground-glass opacifications with interlobular septal thickening in bilateral lungs. A lung-biopsy sample obtained
by VATLB revealed Congo Red-positive amorphous eosinophilic deposits in the alveolar septa. Surgical biopsy of
abdominal wall skin and subcutaneous fat was also performed, which showed the apple-green birefringence with
polarized light on Congo red stain was demonstrated in dermis. The serum immunoelectrophoresis showed monoclonal
lambda light chains. A bone marrow biopsy specimen comprised 11.5% plasma cells. She was therefore diagnosed with
diffuse parenchymal pulmonary amyloidosis accompanied by MM. The patient was referred to the hematology
department for further chemotherapy.
Conclusions: It is important to recognize diffuse parenchymal pulmonary amyloidosis to avoid misdiagnosis.

Background
Amyloidosis is a rare disease characterized by the depos￾ition of insoluble misfolded proteins in various tissues
and organs. Approximately 6–10 cases occur annually
per 100,000 in western Europe and the United States
[1–3]. But the exact incidence is unknown.
The respiratory system is involved in 50% of patients
with amyloidosis, although radiographic demonstration
is much less common [4, 5]. The respiratory amyloidosis
may be localized or part of systemic amyloidosis. The
three main types of respiratory involvement are tracheo￾bronchial, nodular parenchymal, and diffuse parenchymal
pulmonary amyloidosis [4].
Diffuse parenchymal pulmonary amyloidosis, also
known as diffuse alveolar-septal amyloidosis, is the least
common type of pulmonary amyloidosis. This type is
sometimes seen in patients with multiple myeloma (MM)
and is associated with a poor prognosis [6]. In this article,
we will describe the clinical characteristics of a patient
with diffuse parenchymal pulmonary amyloidosis associ￾ated with MM diagnosed by video-assisted thoracoscopic
lung biopsy (VATLB) in our hospital to improve our un￾derstanding of this disease.
Case presentation
A 58-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of a
non-productive cough and progressive shortness of breath.
She had a history of renal insufficiency and persistent
proteinuria, without any extra-renal involvement. She was
diagnosed with IgA nephropathy for 15 years and had
received immunosuppressive therapy for 6 years.

Her vital signs were stable at initial examination; the
patient was afebrile and oxygen saturation was 95% in
ambient air. On physical examination, auscultation of the
lungs detected slight coarse crackles at the bilateral bases.
The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.
Her hemoglobin was 95 g/L but renal function and
calcium level were normal. The patient was negative for
antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in
immunofluorescence assays. Repeated exams of sputum
smear did not yield any pathogenic micro-organisms.
Serum free light chain analysis showed measuring
lambda light chain of 2.59 g/L. Serum protein electro￾phoresis revealed low IgG, IgA, and IgM levels, with
reported immunoelectrophoresis (IEP) showing mono￾clonal lambda light chain peak with the monoclonal
protein. A 24-h urine contained 5521 mg of protein.
High-resolution chest CT revealed disclosed ground-glass
opacities (GGOs) with interlobular septal thickening in bi￾lateral lungs (Fig. 1a and b). Chest and abdominal CT
shows soft tissue infiltration of the subcutaneous fat layer
with asymmetric bulging of the chest and abdominal wall
(Fig. 1c and d). Pulmonary function tests revealed a mod￾erately restrictive ventilation disorder, with a forced vital
capacity (FVC) of 1.76 L (69.0% of predicted) and severe
reduction of diffusion capacity (DLCO SB 20.8% of pre￾dicted). Cardiac biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides,
particularly B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac
troponin-T were normal. Echocardiogram showed normal
left ventricular ejection fraction of 61% and there were no
features of cardiac amyloidosis. A VATLB was performed,
which showed marked thickening of the alveolar wall
deposition of amorphous eosinophilic amyloid at the
bronchial mucosa, pulmonary vessel wall and interstitium.
Congo red staining display apple-green birefringence in
polarised light (Fig. 2a and b). The immunohistochemical
stain for protein A was negative for secondary amyloid.
Following the VATLB results, bone marrow examination
was performed. Bone marrow examination showed 11.5%
plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction. Bone
marrow cells by flow cytometry exhibited a typical pheno￾type for plasma cells, expressing monoclonal cytoplasmatic
CD138, CD38, and cLambda instead of CD19, CD56 and
cKappa, which are characteristic of the typical immunophe￾notype of MM. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
was carried out to check on the bone marrow aspirate. The
most frequent abnormality in the patients was 1q21 ampli￾fication (25%), followed by 14q32 (IGH) translocations
(29.5%), without 13q14 (RB1) deletion, 13q14.3 (D13S319)
deletion and p53 deletion. No lytic bone lesions were
detected with positron emission tomography/computed
tomography (PET/CT). This confirmed the diagnosis of
MM, λ light chain type, stage I. Surgical biopsy of ab￾dominal wall skin and subcutaneous fat was also per￾formed, which showed the apple-green birefringence
with polarized light on Congo red stain was demon￾strated in dermis (Fig. 3a and b).
She was therefore diagnosed with diffuse parenchymal
pulmonary amyloidosis accompanied by MM. The pa￾tient was referred to the hematology department, where
the patient started chemotherapy with bortezomib and

dexamethasone, and her symptoms relieved 2 months
after the initial presentation. No adverse effects were ob￾served and the laboratory results were stable.
Discussion and conclusion
MM accounts for 1% of all cancers and 10% of all
hematologic malignancies [7]. Amyloidosis is a rare compli￾cation associated with MM. The most commonly affected
organs are the kidneys, heart, spleen, lymph nodes and the
liver [8]. Pulmonary is an uncommon site of extramedullary
involvement in MM. Diffuse parenchymal amyloidosis as
pulmonary manifestation of MM is even rarer; only a few
cases have been reported [8–14].
Diffuse parenchymal amyloidosis is characterized by the
presence of amyloid deposits in the alveolar septa and ves￾sel walls. Pathologic examination of diffuse parenchymal
pulmonary amyloidosis shows deposition of amorphous
eosinophilic amyloid in the alveolar septa, especially around
the capillary vessels [15]. Therefore, HRCT findings in such
patients mainly comprise GGOs, interlobular septal thick￾ening, intralobular reticular opacity, and nodules [1, 16].
Diffuse amyloidosis is sometimes accompanied by medias￾tinal lymphadenopathy. Pleural effusion may be present
and occasionally dominate the clinical course. Multiple
cysts and calcification probably resulting from fragile
alveolar walls as a consequence of amyloid deposition
both on alveolar walls and around capillaries have been de￾scribed [17]. Differential considerations of diffuse parenchy￾mal pulmonary amyloidosis are quite broad and include
pneumonia, pneumoconiosis, interstitial lung disease and
lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Diffuse parenchymal pulmonary amyloidosis has a re￾markably different, more clinical presentation. Such pa￾tients may develop symptoms of coughing and shortness
of breath secondary to the amyloid deposits. It is charac￾terized by widespread amyloid deposition involving small
vessels and the interstitium [18]. This is reflected by
lung function tests showing a restrictive pattern with re￾duced diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide and hypox￾aemia upon exertion [8]. Affected individuals are more
likely to progress to pulmonary hypertension and re￾spiratory failure [1].
Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis
and typing of amyloidosis. Diagnosis of amyloidosis is
confirmed by the presence of apple-green birefringence
under polarized light of a tissue biopsy stained with

Congo Red [5]. The diagnosis of pulmonary amyloidosis
is extremely important and requires histological analysis
to differentiate it from other interstitial lung diseases.
The diagnosis of pulmonary amyloid can be made by
fiberoptic bronchoscopy, VATLB, and open thoracotomy.
Although transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) is useful in
some amyloidosis cases, it may be of less efficacy in
establishing diagnosis due to the limit of the amount
biopsy sampling. The lung VATLB is highly specific and
sensitive. The biopsy of a clinically suspected organ is an
invasive procedure and may be associated with compli￾cations including hemorrhage. Because amyloidosis is a
systemic disease, routine biopsies from nonsymptomatic
sites including the rectal mucosa, abdominal fat pad and
labial salivary glands are more commonly used [19]. But,
clinical and radiological manifestations of subcutaneous
amyloidosis are very rare. In our case, diffuse soft tissue
infiltration of the subcutaneous fat layer with asymmetric
bulging of the chest and abdominal wall were demon￾strated on CT. Surgical skin biopsy including the subcuta￾neous fat pad can be performed safely and is useful for
diagnosing amyloidosis [20, 21].
Once the diagnosis is clear, diffuse parenchymal pulmon￾ary amyloidosis requires intervention. The therapeutic goal
for patients with concurrent pulmonary amyloidosis and
MM is suppression of the production of amyloid protein
comprising immunoglobulin light chain [7, 22]. Monoclo￾nal antibodies such as daratumumab (Dara, human IgG1
anti-CD38) have shown promising efficacy for the treat￾ment of relapsed and refractory MM and heavily pretreated
amyloidosis [23, 24]. Therapy was well tolerated. Prospect￾ive studies of daratumumab alone or in combination with
chemotherapy are warranted. Treatment of systemic amyl￾oidosis aims at reducing the clonal cell populations produ￾cing amyloidogenic immunoglobulins, using high-dose
chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant￾ation in carefully selected patients. Its efficiency in treating
diffuse pulmonary amyloidosis has not been established.
Lung transplantation for isolated pulmonary amyloidosis
has been reported [25]. The AL amyloid then contributed
to pulmonary hypertension (PH) with severe symptoms
necessitating lung transplantation. Ellender et al. described
a case with PH from amyloidosis secondary to systemic
lupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome, the patient
received bilateral lung transplantation and remained stable
after 7 years post lung transplantation [26]. Lung trans￾plantation for isolated pulmonary amyloidosis or combined
with PH may be performed in highly selected patients with
good long-term outcome.
Diffuse parenchymal amyloidosis is usually a systemic
phenomenon with a poor prognosis. A median survival
for untreated patients is 13 months, and with the devel￾opment of heart failure the survival duration decrease to
less than 4 months [18]. When compared with nodular
pulmonary amyloidosis, patients with diffuse parenchymal
pulmonary amyloidosis has a far worse prognosis [10].
Gradual worsening of pulmonary function and symptoms
is typical.
In conclusion, diffuse parenchymal pulmonary amyloid￾osis is a fatal disorder that is rare and often undiagnosed.
Radiologists and physicians should consider amyloid in
clinically perplexing chronically ill patients, particularly
those with plasma cell dyscrasias or chronic inflammatory
states. Tissue biopsy is the gold standard. With the use of
subcutaneous fat pad and lung biopsy, an early diagnosis
can be made.
