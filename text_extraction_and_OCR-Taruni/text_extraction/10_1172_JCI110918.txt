A B S T R A C T The role of prostaglandins (PG), renin￾angiotensin system (RAS) and calcium (Ca) in the con￾trol of renal hemodynamics and glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) in chronic hypercalcemia (serum Ca 12.8
mg%) was studied. Renal blood flow (RBF, 6.39 ml/
min per gram kidney weight [gkw]) and GFR (0.52
ml/min per gkw) were significantly decreased in hy￾percalcemic rats when compared with normocalcemic
rats (7.15, P < 0.001 and 0.74, P < 0.05, respectively).
These changes in RBF and GFR occurred independent
of any significant alterations in systemic hemodynam￾ics, blood and plasma volume. Inhibition of the renal
PG with indomethacin resulted in marked decrements
in both RBF (6.39-4.12 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01)
and GFR (0.52-0.19 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01) in
hypercalcemic rats, whereas there was no significant
alterations in normocalcemic rats. Inhibition of the
RAS with captopril resulted in marked increments in
both RBF (6.39-7.35 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.05) and
GFR (0.52-0.74 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.05) in hy￾percalcemic rats. In fact, there was no significant dif￾ference from the RBF and GFR of similarly treated
normocalcemic rats. Similar results were also obtained
with the competitive angiotensin II (AII) antagonist
(sarcosyll-isoleucyl5-glycyl8) AII. Since both the renal
PG and the RAS are involved in the control of RBF
and GFR in hypercalcemia, the role of each is best
revealed in the absence of the other. Hence, compar￾ison of the RBF and GFR in the PG-inhibited hyper￾calcemic rats in the presence of AII (4.12 and 0.19 ml/
min per gkw, respectively) and absence of AII (5.99
and 0.53 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01 for both) reveals
the vasoconstrictive role for All in hypercalcemia. On

the other hand, comparison of the RBF and GFR in
the AII-inhibited hypercalcemic rats in the presence
of PG (7.35 and 0.74 ml/min per gkw, respectively)
and absence of PG (5.99 and 0.53 ml/min per gkw,
P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) reveals the va￾sodilatory role for PG in hypercalcemia. Finally, com￾parison of the RBF and GFR in both PG- and All￾inhibited hypercalcemic rats (5.99 and 0.53 ml/min
per gkw, respectively) with similarly treated normo￾calcemic rats (7.30 and 0.94 ml/min per gkw, P
< 0.001 and P < 0.005, respectively) reveals the va￾soconstrictive role for Ca in chronic hypercalcemia.
Our study therefore demonstrates that in chronic hy￾percalcemia the RBF and GFR are controlled by an
active interplay of the vasoconstrictive effect of AII,
the vasodilatory effect of renal PG, and the direct va￾soconstrictive effect of Ca, independent of either AII
or PG. The sum total of these forces produces a modest
but significant decrease in RBF and GFR.
INTRODUCTION
The association of acute and chronic hypercalcemia
with decrements in renal blood flow (RBF)' and glo￾merular filtration rate (GFR) has been widely recog￾nized in both man and experimental animals (1-15).
While the mechanisms responsible for the decrement
in RBF and GFR have been studied in anesthetized,
acutely hypercalcemic animals, there have been no
such studies in the setting of chronic hypercalcemia.
Since recent in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed

an important role for calcium ion in the vasoconstric￾tive response of the vasculature to angiotensin II (AII)
(16-18), it is possible that the decrement in RBF and
GFR in chronic hypercalcemia is at least, in part,
mediated by this potent vasoconstrictive hormone.
Alternatively, calcium ion could directly, independent
of AII, mediate the decrement in RBF and GFR in
chronic hypercalcemia (19). On the other hand, the
vasodilatory renal prostaglandins (PG), whose synthe￾sis in vitro has been shown to be stimulated by calcium
ion (20-22), could have an attenuating effect on the
vasoconstrictor activity of AII and calcium ion. The
present experiments were therefore performed to (a)
assess the systemic and renal hemodynamic effect of
chronic hypercalcemia in the conscious rat, and (b)
determine the role of PG, AII, and calcium per se in
the control of RBF and GFR in such a setting.
METHODS
All studies were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles
River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) weighing between 225
and 325 g. Animals were fed either a commercially obtained
normal diet (ICN Nutritional Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH)
or an identical diet to which dihydrotachysterol (Philips
Roxan, Columbus, OH), 4.25 mg/kg of diet was added.
Water intake was allowed ad lib.
Since animals on vitamin D-supplemented diet eat less
food than do animals on normal diet (23), in all the studies,
the daily food intake of the animals on normal diet was
limited to that of pair-fed animals on vitamin D-supple￾mented diet. Such supplementation with vitamin D in￾creased serum calcium by the 3rd d. This level remained
stable for the ensuing 5 d of the study (23). Serum sodium,
potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate were not
altered by the diet. The following studies were undertaken.
Effect of chronic hypercalcemia
on systemic and renal hemodynamics,
GFR and blood volume (group 1)
Following 8 d on either control (n = 9) or vitamin D￾supplemented diet (n = 9), rats were anesthetized with ether.
Polyethylene catheters (PE50) were inserted into the jugular
vein and femoral artery for infusion and blood sampling
respectively, and the bladder was catheterized with a cath￾eter (PE60) with care to eliminate dead space. Cannulation
of the right carotid artery into the left ventricle was accom￾plished with tapered PE350 tubing. Ventricular cannulation
was confirmed by pressure wave tracing. During surgery,
isotonic saline equivalent to 0.5% of the body weight was
infused to replace estimated fluid losses. Animals were then
allowed to recover fully from anesthesia, while they were
placed in individual restraining cages. Mean arterial pressure
(MAP) was continuously monitored (Electronics for Medi￾cine, White Plains, NY) and inulin in 0.45% saline was in￾fused at a rate of 0.6 ml/100 g body wt per h, which pro￾duced constant plasma inulin levels of -20 mg/dl. After a
60-min equilibration period, the animals' urine flow was
stable and two 30-min urine collections were obtained. Blood
(200 jsl) samples were drawn in the middle of each collection
period and the volume was replaced with equal volumes of
0.9% saline. The blood and urine were analyzed for inulin
concentration and inulin clearance was calculated in the
standard manner. Following the two 30-min urine collec￾tions, cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR),
RBF, and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were determined
by a radioactive microsphere technique described by Hsu
et al. (24) and adapted for use in our laboratory (25). The
microspheres used were 8.8±0.9 gm in diam and were la￾beled with 85Sr.
Calculations were performed as follows:

Blood volume was determined in six hypercalcemic and six
pair-fed normocalcemic rats utilizing the 'WI-albumin method
of Thiel et al. (26) and Flamenbaum et al. (27) as described
by our laboratory (28).
PG in chronic hypercalcemia
Effect of hypercalcemia on urinary PG excretion. To
assess the effect of hypercalcemia on urinary PG excretion,
24-h urinary samples were collected during day 7 of the
study, in normocalcemic (n = 8) and hypercalcemic
(n = 8) rats. For these studies, rats were placed in metabolic
cages that allow for separation of urine and feces (Hoeltege
Co., Cincinnati, OH). Urine was collected in glass tubes to
which sodium azide was added to achieve a final concen￾tration of 4 mg/ml of urine. After measuring the volume,
the urine was stored at -20°C and subsequently was assayed
for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by radioimmunoassay using a
modification for urine of the procedure of Dray et al. (29).
Effect of PG inhibition on GFR and renal hemodynamics
in hypercalcemic rats (group 2). To determine the role of
PG in the control of hemodynamics and GFR in hypercal￾cemia, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, was ad￾ministered to normocalcemic control and hypercalcemic
rats. Following 7 d of on either control (n = 8) or vitamin
D-supplemented diet (n = 8), animals were given indo￾methacin (3.33 mg/kg i.p., every 8 h for 24 h). To confirm
the degree of cyclooxygenase blockade, urinary PGE2 ex￾cretion was measured during the 24-h period. Measurements
of renal hemodynamics and GFR were made on day 8 of the
study as described above in group 1 animals.
The renin-angiotensin system
(RAS) in chronic hypercalcemia
Effect of hypercalcemia on plasma renin activity. To
assess the effect of hypercalcemia on circulating levels of
Renal Hemodynamics, Calcium, Prostaglandins, and Angiotensin 1625

renin activity, plasma renin activity was measured in nor￾mocalcemic control (n = 8) and hypercalcemic (n = 8) rats
on day 8 of the study. In these studies, blood was obtained
as free-flowing blood issuing from the trunk of guillotined
animals. Blood was collected in prechilled tubes containing
sodium EDTA and was centrifuged within 15 min at 0°C.
The plasma was stored at -20°C and subsequently assayed
for renin activity by radioimmunoassay (30).
Furthermore, to determine the effect of high urinary PGE2
excretion (see below) on circulating levels of renin activity,
plasma renin activity was also measured in normocalcemic
control (n = 8) and hypercalcemic rats following PG syn￾thesis inhibition with indomethacin (n = 8).
Effect of AII inhibition on GFR and renal hemodynamics
in chronic hypercalcemia (group 3). To determine the sig￾nificance of All in the control of RBF and GFR in hyper￾calcemia, inhibitors of the synthesis or action of All were
administered to normocalcemic control and hypercalcemic
rats. In the first group of studies (group 3 A), following 4
d of on either control (n = 5) or vitamin D-supplemented
diet (n = 8), animals were given the converting enzyme
inhibitor, captopril (SQ 14,225, E. R. Squibb & Sous, Inc.,
Princeton, NJ) (13.33 mg/kg, orally, every 8 h for 4 d). This
dose of captopril completely prevented the pressor response
to 50 ng of exogenous AI in every animal studied. Measure￾ments of hemodynamics and GFR were made on day 8 of
the study.
Since the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, may
have additional effects than AII formation inhibition, such
as increased levels of kinins, a second group of studies (group
3 B) were undertaken with the competitive AII antagonist
(sarcosyll-isoleucyl5-glycyl8, Sar'-Ile5-Gly8) All (Bachem,
Torrance, CA). The AII antagonist was administered on day
8 of the study (2.5 jg/kg per min, i.v., for 90 min) to nor￾mocalcemic (n = 4) and hypercalcemic (n = 7) rats. This
dose completely prevented the pressor response to 25 ng of
exogenous AII in every animal studied. Measurement of he￾modynamics was made following the 90-min infusion period.
GFR was not measured in this subgroup of rats.
Effect of AII inhibition in
PG-inhibited hypercalcemic rats (group 4)
The role of All in the control of renal hemodynamics and
GFR in hypercalcemia independent of PG was studied by
administering inhibitors of the synthesis or action of AII to
normocalcemic control and hypercalcemic rats with PG in￾hibition. In the first group of studies (group 4 A), following
4 d of on either control (n = 4) or vitamin D-supplemented
(n = 9) diet, animals were given the converting enzyme
inhibitor captopril. On day 7 of the study these animals were
given indomethacin. Measurements of renal hemodynamics
and GFR were made on day 8 of the study.
A second group of studies (group 4 B) used a competitive
All antagonist (Sar'-Ile5-Gly8) All. The AII antagonist and
indomethacin were begun on day 7 of the study and given
for 24 h to control (n = 5) and hypercalcemic (n = 6) rats.
Measurement of renal hemodynamics was made on day 8
of the study.
Statistical analysis
A two-tailed unpaired Student's t test was used to compare
results of each experimental group with its corresponding
control group and a one-way analysis of variance (with Stu￾dent-Newman-Keuls modification) (31) was used to compare
results within the experimental or control groups. A P value
<0.05 was considered significant. All data are expressed as
mean±SE.
RESULTS
Effect of chronic hypercalcemia on systemic and
renal hemodynamics, GFR and blood volume (group
1). Table I shows the hemodynamic consequences of
8 d of hypercalcemia in the conscious rat. There were
no significant alterations in systemic hemodynamics
as MAP, CI, and SVR were similar in normocalcemic
control and hypercalcemic rats. Likewise, both blood
and plasma volume were similar in the two groups of
rats. However, there were significant changes in renal
hemodynamics and GFR in the hypercalcemic
rats. RBF decreased (7.15-6.39 ml/min per gkw,
P < 0.001), RVR increased (15.76-17.86 mmHg/ml
per min per gkw, P < 0.005), and GFR decreased

Likewise, in normocalcemic rats there were slight but
insignificant increases in RBF, RVR, and GFR. In con￾trast, in hypercalcemic rats (bottom panel of Table II)
PG inhibition resulted in a significant increase in MAP.
This was due to a small increment in both peripheral
vascular resistance and CI, neither of which were
themselves statistically significant. Despite the in￾crease in systemic pressure, there was a marked dec￾rement in renal hemodynamics. Thus, RVR doubled
causing a marked decrement in RBF from 6.39 to 4.12
ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01. Likewise, there was a pro￾found and even more severe decrement in GFR from
0.52 to 0.19 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01.
Effect of AII inhibition on GFR and renal hemo￾dynamics in chronic hypercalcemia (group 3). Plasma
renin activity was not different in hypercalcemic rats,
7.13±0.094 vs. 5.78±0.51 ng AI/ml per h in normo￾calcemic controls. Despite comparable plasma renin
activity, since enhanced end-organ response to All in
the hypercalcemic state could not be excluded, the role
of All in the control of renal hemodynamics and GFR
in chronic hypercalcemia was evaluated.
In normocalcemic rats (top of Table II) following
the administration of captopril, there was a mild but
significant decrease in MAP. This decrease was due to
small, statistically not significant decrements in CI and
SVR. Captopril administration also caused an increase
in RBF as RVR decreased, but GFR remained unal￾tered. In the hypercalcemic rats (bottom of Table II),
there were no significant changes in systemic pressure,
but marked increment in renal hemodynamics and
GFR. Specifically, as RVR decreased RBF increased
(6.39-7.35 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.05) when compared
to AII intact hypercalcemic rats. Likewise, GFR in￾creased (0.52-0.74 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.05). Fol￾lowing the administration of captopril, the resultant
renal hemodynamics and GFR in the hypercalcemic
rats were not significantly different than in the nor￾mocalcemic control rats. In fact, a comparison of the
captopril-treated hypercalcemic rats with normocal￾cemic rats also receiving captopril reveals no differ￾ence in GFR, RBF, or RVR. Since the converting en￾zyme inhibitor, captopril, is known to have effects
other than inhibition of AII synthesis, to better define
the role of AII, renal hemodynamics were also eval￾uated by the administration of a competitive AII an￾tagonist (Sarl-Ile5-Gly8) All (group 3 B). As shown in
the top panel of Table III, this agent caused no sig￾nificant alterations in either blood pressure or renal
hemodynamics in the control rat. In contrast in the
chronic hypercalcemic rat (bottom panel), RBF in￾creased (6.39-7.58 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01) as RVR
decreased without associated changes in systemic pres￾sure. In fact, following the administration of (Sarl-Ile5-
Gly8) AII, the resultant renal hemodynamics were not
significantly different from that of normocalcemic
(Sar'-Ile5-Gly8) All rats. Our data therefore show that
the inhibition of the synthesis or the antagonism of the
action of All normalize renal hemodynamics and GFR
in chronic hypercalcemia.
Effect of AII inhibition or antagonism in hyper￾calcemia during PG inhibition (Group 4). Plasma
renin activity following PG inhibition was not signif￾icantly different in hypercalcemic rats, 3.66±0.38 ng
AI/ml per h when compared with normocalcemic con￾trols, 4.55±0.13 ng AI/ml per h. However, since en￾hanced end-organ response to AII was noted in the
hypercalcemic rats, an effect that could be further
enhanced by PG inhibition (32, 33), the role of AII in
the control of renal hemodynamics and GFR in chronic
hypercalcemia during PG inhibition was evaluated
(Tables II and III).
As shown in the top panel of Table II, normocal￾cemic control rats who received captopril and indo￾methacin (group 4 A) had significant decreases in MAP
when compared with normocalcemic control rats who
were treated with indomethacin alone. This was due
to a significant decrease in SVR. Likewise, RVR de￾creased but neither GFR nor RBF were altered.
In hypercalcemic rats receiving both indomethacin
and captopril (bottom panel of Table II) there was also
a significant decrease in MAP when compared with
animals treated with indomethacin alone. This de￾crease was due to small, statistically not significant
decrements in CI and SVR. Despite this decrease in
MAP, inhibition of All synthesis during PG inhibition
in the hypercalcemic rats resulted in marked incre￾ments in renal hemodynamics and GFR. RBF in￾creased (4.12-5.99 ml/min per gkw, P < 0.01), RVR
decreased (34.58-19.11 mmHg/ml per min per gkw,
P < 0.01) and GFR increased (0.19-0.53 ml/min per
gkw, P < 0.01).
The role of AII in the control of renal hemodynamics
in hypercalcemia during PG inhibition was also eval￾uated by the administration of (Sarl-Ile5-Gly8) to in￾domethacin-treated rats (group 4 B). As shown in Ta￾ble III, when compared with AII intact PG-inhibited
rats (group 2), this agent did not alter MAP in either
normocalcemic or hypercalcemic rats. Although it did
not affect renal hemodynamics in normocalcemic rats,
its effects in the hypercalcemic rats were profound.
Thus RBF increased (4.12-5.86 ml/m per gkw,
P < 0.01) and RVR decreased markedly (34.6-23.4
mmHg/ml per min per gkw, P < 0.01). Therefore in
chronic hypercalcemia the inhibition of the synthesis
or the antagonism of the action of AII during PG syn￾thesis inhibition is associated with marked and signif￾icant increment in renal hemodynamics and GFR.

DISCUSSION
The fact that acute and chronic hypercalcemia cause
a decreased RBF and GFR in both man and experi￾mental animals has been repeatedly reported (1-15).
Studies performed by Humes et al. in the rat (13) and
Okahara et al. in the dog (15) analyzed the factors
responsible for the control of RBF and GFR in acute
hypercalcemia in the anesthetized state, and clearly
pointed to the functional nature of these changes as
they were sensitive to hormonal and pharmacological
manipulations. In contrast, there are no studies that
analyze the mechanisms responsible for the changes
in GFR and RBF in chronic hypercalcemia. Some of
the renal perturbations that occur in chronic hyper￾calcemia, such as the renal concentrating defect, are
not readily reversible and therefore probably related
to the anatomic interstitial and tubular changes that
supervene (5). Whether these anatomic changes con￾tribute to the impairments in RBF and GFR or
whether, as in acute hypercalcemia, these changes are
purely functional is not known.
Our initial studies demonstrated that chronic hy￾percalcemia in the conscious rat causes a reduction in
RBF and GFR independent of the alterations in sys￾temic hemodynamics frequently seen in acute hyper￾Renal Hemodynamics, Calcium, Prostaglandins, and Angiotensin 1629

calcemia (34). The present study does not address the
distribution of the decrement in RBF. However, since
in a recent study (23) we did not find a decrease in
inner medullary plasma flow, which is derived from
the juxtamedullary circulation, it is possible that the
outer cortical circulation is the one primarily affected.
Our subsequent studies were directed to the systematic
elucidation of the roles of PG, All, as well as calcium
per se in these perturbations.
The marked elevation of urinary PG excretion in
chronic hypercalcemia made it attractive to postulate
that these substances may play an important role in
the maintenance of renal hemodynamics in this state.
The administration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor
indomethacin brought about a marked decrement in
PG excretion. This caused a profound decrease in GFR
as RVR doubled and RBF fell markedly. Similar del￾eterious effects of PG inhibition on RBF and GFR have
also been reported in other states associated with high
urinary PG production (35-38).
The plasma renin activity of the chronic hypercal￾cemic rats was not significantly different from nor￾mocalcemic controls. Despite this fact, our experi￾ments reveal that the RAS plays a significant role in
the impairment of RBF and GFR as the inhibition of
either the synthesis of (captopril) or the action of (Sar'-
Ile5-Gly8 All) lead to marked improvement of and in
fact normalization of RBF and GFR. While calcium
ion has been postulated to mediate the action of ex￾ogenous angiotensin on the vascular smooth muscle
and glomerulus (17), such a consequence of endoge￾nous All inhibition on renal vascular tone or the glo￾merulus in hypercalcemia has not been previously de￾scribed.
Although these studies reveal the deleterious effects
of PG inhibition and the beneficial effects of All in￾hibition on RBF and GFR in chronic hypercalcemia,
they do not unveil the role of PG and AII in the control
of RBF and GFR independent of each other. Thus, in
the experiments using indometacin, AII was intact and
in the experiments performed during AII inhibition
the renal PG were intact. This led us to perform ex￾periments in animals treated with both PG and AII
inhibitors.
The role of AII in the control of RBF and GFR in
chronic hypercalcemia is best revealed by comparing
the RBF and GFR of PG-depleted hypercalcemic rats
without (group 2) and with (group 4) inhibition of the
RAS. As shown in the bottom of Tables II and III, AII
inhibition in the PG-inhibited hypercalcemic rats re￾sulted in a marked improvement in both RBF and
GFR. It becomes apparent that a large component of
the decrement in RBF and GFR observed in hyper￾calcemia during PG inhibition is due to the enhanced
vasoconstrictive effect of AII. These comparisons, thus,
unveil the very important vasoconstrictor effect of All
in hypercalcemia independent of PG. This vasocon￾striction is observed despite the fact that plasma renin
activity is not increased, reflecting the enhanced renal
sensitivity to AII in the hypercalcemic state.
The role of PG is apparent in the comparison of
RBF and GFR of AII-inhibited hypercalcemic rats in
the presence (group 3) and absence (group 4) of PG
(bottom of Tables II and III). The RBF and GFR of
hypercalcemic AII-inhibited rats who have intact PG￾synthetizing ability is significantly greater than that
of AII-inhibited hypercalcemic rats who have no PG￾synthetizing ability. In fact, the former group has renal
hemodynamics and GFR that are indistinguishable
from normocalcemic controls. These comparisons un￾veil the important vasodilating effect of PG in hyper￾calcemia independent of AII.
Finally, the comparison of the RBF and GFR of
hypercalcemic rats with that of normocalcemic control
rats in the absence of both PG and AII reveals the role
of calcium per se, in the control of RBF and GFR. As
shown by groups 4 A and 4 B in Tables II and III,
hypercalcemic rats with AII and PG inhibition have
significantly lower RBF and GFR than the normocal￾cemic rats with AII and PG inhibition, thus revealing
the vasoconstrictor role of calcium in chronic hyper￾calcemia, independent of both AII and PG.
It is of note that in the development of hypercal￾cemia and particularly following the administration
of indomethacin there was a marked decrease in fil￾tration fraction reflecting a greater decrement in GFR
than in RBF. It is attractive to postulate that this dis￾sociation points to an effect on the ultrafiltration coef￾ficient as was shown in the acute setting (13). It is thus
possible that in hypercalcemia AII-mediated contrac￾tion of glomerular mesangial cells is accentuated (39),
an effect that is even more marked when glomerular
PG synthesis (40, 41) is inhibited.
The present study, therefore, clearly dissects the
contributions of calcium, All, and PG on RBF and
GFR in the conscious rat with chronic hypercalcemia.
The possibility that a decrease in extracellular fluid
volume in hypercalcemic rats could account for the
observed changes was considered. However, both
plasma and blood volume were similar in hypercal￾cemic and control rats. The sensitivity of the method
used could miss a difference in the 10% range, but as
shown in a recent study from our laboratory (28), a
larger change is readily demonstrable. In our mea￾surements, in fact, the hypercalcemic rats had even
slightly higher plasma volumes. Finally, the failure of
captopril and Sar'-Ile5-Gly8 AII to significantly lower
MAP in hypercalcemic rats (Tables II and III) also
1630 M. Levi, M. A. Ellis, and T. Berl

provides evidence against significant volume deple￾tion. The plasma volume measurements are in concert
with the very similar rate of sodium excretion mea￾sured in the course of an 8-d balance study of rats
becoming hypercalcemic on vitamin D and their pair￾fed controls (23) (2.34±0.06 ,eq/d in rats developing
hypercalcemia and 2.46±0.05 ,ueq/d in control rats).
Our results are therefore not likely to be due to changes
in extracellular fluid volume. Although we did not
examine the role of other hormonal systems that affect
renal hemodynamics, such as catecholamines and va￾sopressin, the fact that both GFR and RBF are com￾pletely normalized by inhibition of AII, provided PG
synthesis is unperturbed, suggests that other hormonal
systems probably do not play a central role in this state.
However, in the absence of PG, a role for catechol￾amines and vasopressin cannot be totally excluded.
Our observations demonstrate that hypercalcemia of
8-d duration causes hemodynamic changes of the kid￾ney that are functional in nature, findings that contrast
to the abnormality in renal concentrating ability,
which is associated with structural renal changes. We
conclude, therefore, that in the conscious rat with
chronic hypercalcemia, RBF and GFR are controlled
by an active interplay of the enhanced vasoconstrictive
effect of All, the enhanced synthesis and action of the
vasodilatory renal PG and the direct vasoconstrictor
effect of calcium, independent of either AII or PG.
The sum total of these forces produces a modest but
significant decrease in renal hemodynamics and GFR.
