Abstract
Because the osteoporosis occurring in chronic cholestatic
liver disease (CCLD) is associated with decreased bone for￾mation and is reversible by liver transplantation, substances
retained in plasma during cholestasis may impair osteoblast
function. This hypothesis was tested using a new bioassay
that measures plasma mitogenic activity (PMA) for normal
human osteoblast-like (hOB) cells. In 29 jaundiced patients,
mean PMA was 56.4% (P < 0.001) of that in 29 age- and
sex-matched normal subjects, and the decrease in PMA was
similar in the 14 with CCLD and the 15 with other causes
of jaundice. Bile acids and bilirubin are the two major
groups of products retained during cholestasis. The common
conjugated bile acids and bilirubin were added to normal
human plasma in concentrations simulating those found in
patients with CCLD. Various bile salts had no effect on
PMA whereas unconjugated bilirubin decreased PMA in a
dose-dependent fashion (r = -0.98, P < 0.0001) without
affecting cell viability. Relatively selective removal of biliru￾bin from the plasma by photobleaching normalized the de￾creased PMA in five jaundiced patients but produced no
apparent change in five normal subjects. These data support
the hypothesis that hyperbilirubinemia or possibly other
photolabile substances impair osteoblast proliferative ca￾pacity and thus may play a major role in the pathogenesis
of the osteoporosis associated with CCLD. (J. Clin. Invest.

Introduction
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)' and primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis (PSC) are forms of chronic cholestatic liver disease
(CCLD) that mainly affect young and middle-aged adults (1).

these diseases include low bone density and fractures of the
vertebrae and peripheral skeleton (2-6).
The causes of bone disease in CCLD are not well under￾stood. In Great Britain, a mixture of osteoporosis and osteoma￾lacia commonly occurs due to associated vitamin D deficiency
aggravated by steatorrhea. In contrast, in the United States,
because of fortification of food with vitamin D, osteoporo￾sis, not osteomalacia, is the major form of the bone disease
(3, 6-9).
In American and Australian patients with severe liver dis￾ease, bone formation is decreased. Hodgson et al. (10) found
that serum osteocalcin, a biochemical marker for bone forma￾tion, was significantly decreased whereas urinary hydroxypro￾line excretion, a biochemical marker for bone resorption, was
normal. Decreased bone formation in patients with CCLD has
been found by histomorphometric studies of iliac biopsy sam￾ples (10-13). Also, it has been demonstrated that successful
liver transplantation is associated with substantial increases in
bone density in these patients (5).
These observations led us to hypothesize that substances
retained in plasma during cholestasis impair osteoblast function.
To test this hypothesis, we developed a new bioassay for plasma
mitogenic activity (PMA), based on proliferation of bone cells
in vitro, and we used this assay to study the antiproliferative
effects of bile acids and bile pigments.
Methods
Subjects
Plasma was obtained from 29 fasting, jaundiced patients and from 29
fasting, normal control subjects who were pair-matched by age and sex.
Of the patients, 14 had CCLD (PBC in 3 and PSC in 11), 5 had obstruc￾tive jaundice secondary to cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic carcinoma,
and 10 had primary hepatic dysfunction (alcoholic liver disease in 6,
chronic autoimmune hepatitis in 3, and metastatic carcinoid in 1). Only
the three patients with chronic autoimmune hepatitis were under treat￾ment with glucocorticoids. No patient was receiving cholestyramine or
supplementation with calcium or vitamin D and all had normal serum
calcium concentrations. There were 16 men and 13 women in each
group. The mean (±SEM) total serum bilirubin concentration measured
by standard colorimetric assay after reaction with sulfonilic acid to form
isomers of azobilirubin in the jaundiced patients was 0.228±0.146 mM;
range, 0.255-0.592 (13.4±8.6 mg/dl [range, 1.5-34.8 mg/dl]).2 The
median ages of the jaundiced patients and the control subjects were 51
yr (range, 34-68 yr). The protocol was reviewed and approved by
the Mayo Institutional Review Board, and all subjects gave informed
consent.
Bioassay of PMA
Bone cell culture. We used normal human osteoblast-like (hOB) cells
as surrogates for normal osteoblasts. These hOB cells were obtained

from trabecular bone discarded as waste material during orthopedic
surgery and were cultured as described (14, 15). After removal of fibrous
tissue, the bone samples were washed, diced into small (2-4 mm in
diameter) fragments, and digested with crude bacterial collagenase (1
mg/ml in DME) for 2 h at 370C in a shaking water bath. The bone
fragments were then cultured in a growth medium consisting of low￾calcium (0.2 mM) DME/Ham's F-12 medium containing penicillin and
streptomycin (100 U/ml; 100 ,g/ml) and 10% (vol/vol) normal human
plasma. Cells grown from explants were passaged once and grown to
confluence. At this time, the cells are nearly homogeneous because
> 95% of them contain osteocalcin, a protein that is specific for cells
of the osteoblast lineage (16). Extensive characterization (15) has shown
that the cells display the complete phenotype of mature osteoblasts (17).
The confluent cells were trypsinized, subcultured on 24-well plates in
medium supplemented with 10% normal human plasma at a seeding
density of 10,000/cm2, and were used for assay of test plasmas. To
minimize variability, each well was seeded with a mixture of hOB cells
from six donors.
Assay of test plasma or putative inhibitors
Citrated plasma samples were obtained and stored at -70'C until assay.
Plasma samples were mixed with an equal volume of basal medium, a
1:1 (vol/vol) mixture of DME and Ham's F-12 medium, to create the
proliferative 50% test plasma. After 48 h of subculture in medium
supplemented with 10% normal human plasma to establish cell attach￾ment, the medium was replaced with fresh medium that contained 0.5%
normal human plasma for 48 h to induce proliferative quiescence. The
hOB cells were then exposed to the proliferative test plasma mixture
for a final 48 h of incubation. [3H]Thymidine (2 1LCi/ml) was added for
the final 24 h to measure DNA synthesis (18). [3H]Thymidine incorpora￾tion was assessed by liquid scintillation counting of the trichloroacetic
acid-precipitable material. All assay results represent the mean of mea￾surements from triplicate wells. Because of wide variability among
strains of hOB cells, all experiments were made using six cell strains.
For each experiment the same cell strains were used, and the results are
reported as mean±SEM of these strains. In some experiments, prolifera￾tion of hOB cells was also assessed by direct cell counting in a Coulter
counter (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Cell viability of hOB cells was
assessed by their ability to exclude trypan blue after its addition to the
culture medium.
To avoid photodegradation, all bilirubin-containing plasma samples
were prepared in red light (19), and all cell culture plates were enclosed
in aluminum foil to avoid exposure to white light. Each assay included
samples of plasma from paired jaundiced and control subjects and a
standard reference plasma (pooled plasma from six normal subjects).
Based on the results of 12 normal subjects assessed in 2 different cell
preparations, the coefficient of variation for PMA was 22%.
Trypan blue exclusion was used as an index of cell viability. To
assess the effect of graded doses of bilirubin in 50% plasma and 50%
nutrient (vol/vol) media at the end of 48 h of treatment, media were
removed, and the cells were rinsed and then stained with trypan blue.
The proportion of dead cells (blue staining) was assessed by grid inter￾section in two representative fields per well in each of the six replicate
wells. No less than 120 cells were counted. Results were expressed as
a percentage of total cells counted.
To investigate putative inhibitors of osteoblast proliferation, bile
acids or unconjugated bilirubin was added to the standard reference
plasma, and the effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured.
Unconjugated bilirubin (Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT) was mixed
with bioassay buffer containing albumin, and the mixture was brought
to pH 10 with 2 N NaOH to dissolve the bilirubin. The solution was
then adjusted to pH 7.4 and mixed with normal human plasma to create
a 50% (vol/vol) normal human plasma stock solution containing albumin
at 20 mg/ml and having a bilirubin concentration of 250 kLM. This stock
solution was diluted with 50% normal human plasma medium to obtain
concentrations of bilirubin ranging from those found in plasma of normal
subjects (10 IpM) to those of severely jaundiced subjects (250 NM). The

bilirubin dose-response curve was determined at albumin concentra￾tions of 20 and 40 mg/ml.
The bile acids taurocholic acid, glycocholic acid, taurochenodeoxy￾cholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO) were combined in equimolar concentrations and in individ￾ual concentrations to simulate plasma concentrations observed in pa￾tients with cholestasis (20-22). An initial stock solution that contained a
bile acid concentration approximating the maximal plasma concentration
(400 kAM) seen during cholestasis was serially diluted to a minimal total
concentration (2 MM). Each individual bile acid was serially diluted in
a similar manner simulating its plasma concentration during cholestasis
(0.5-200 1.M). The PMAs of these proliferative test media were then
measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation.
Statistical analysis
All statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's t
test.
Results
Establishment of assay. Because it has been believed that addi￾tion of fetal calf serum to an incubation medium is required to
induce proliferation of human bone cells, we first compared the
effects of different concentrations of human plasma and fetal
calf serum on induction of hOB cell proliferation. Normal hu￾man plasma promoted greater (P < 0.05) proliferation of hOB
cells (Table I) than did equivalent concentrations of fetal calf
serum; stimulation was maximal at 50% plasma. Thus, full
proliferative capacity of the hOB cells was maintained in vitro,
which permitted different plasma samples to be assayed for
mitogenic activity.
Bioassay of plasma. Stimulation of hOB cell proliferation
by plasma samples from the 29 jaundiced patients was
56.4%±4.0% that of plasma samples from the age- and sex￾matched controls (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1). The degree of suppres￾sion of hOB cell proliferation of plasma from the 14 patients
with CCLD was similar to that of plasma from the 15 patients
with other causes of jaundice (mean±SEM, 57.2%±6.9% vs
55.6%±5.4%, respectively, NS). Among plasma samples from
individual subjects, there was no correlation between PMA and
plasma bilirubin concentration or plasma albumin concentra￾tion.
Addition of putative inhibitors. To identify the factor or
factors in plasma from patients with cholestasis that inhibited
hOB cell proliferation, we added varying amounts of bile acids
and unconjugated bilirubin-substances that are retained during
cholestasis-to the normal standard reference pool to produce
plasma concentrations simulating those found in patients with

vidual bile acids were added at concentrations of 0.5-200 kIM
(data not shown). In contrast, in nine separate experiments,
addition of unconjugated bilirubin over the range of 10-250 1tM
inhibited proliferation in each experiment in a dose-dependent
fashion (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3). Varying the albumin concentration
from 20 to 40 mg/ml did not alter this response (data not shown).
Bilirubin's effect on cell proliferation was also assessed in three
experiments by direct cell counting. The correlation between
values obtained with [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell
counting was high (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). Over the same range
of bilirubin concentrations, cell viability was not affected as
assessed by their ability to exclude trypan blue (Table II).
Effect of photobleaching. The plasma bilirubin in patients
with CCLD is a complex mixture containing bilirubin, bilirubin
monoglucuronides, bilirubin diglucuronide, and many isomers
of the glucuronides, as well as covalent bilirubin-albumin com￾plexes. In an attempt to study the combined effect of these
bilirubin species on osteoblast mitogenic activity, plasma sam￾ples from patients with CCLD and from normal controls were
tested before and after exposure to visible light at wavelengths
that selectively destroy bile pigments. Plasma samples from five

Figure 4. High-performance liquid chromatography (32) of plasma from
a patient with PBC before photobleaching (top) and after photobleach￾ing (bottom). Bleaching destroyed conjugated and unconjugated biliru￾bin. The bilirubin conjugates appear as broad groups of peaks because
they include not only bilirubin diglucuronide, which elutes near 6 mi,
and the two bilirubin monoglucuronides, which elute at 11-12 min, but
also numerous acyl-migration isomers of these.
jaundiced patients (total serum bilirubin concentration
[mean±SD] of 14.1±1.3 mg/dl) and five age- and sex-matched
normal controls were photobleached with narrow-spectrum blue
light (450 nm) with peak emission close to the absorption maxi￾mum for bilirubin (19, 23). The plasma was irradiated at 0C
under 1 atm of oxygen through a filter that removed radiation
below 400 nm (i.e., no exposure to ultraviolet light). After 16
h, the light was replaced with a broad-spectrum white light
source and bleaching was continued for another 9 h. The plasma
was centrifuged briefly to remove a slight turbidity and then
was immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -800C until
used in cell culture. Absorbance spectra and high-performance
liquid chromatograms of plasma samples before and after
bleaching demonstrated that this procedure effectively de￾stroyed all measurable bilirubin species. This is shown in Fig.
4 for a single patient. Plasma samples were then assayed, as
described previously, before and after bleaching.
Results of the photobleaching experiment are given in Fig.
5. Before photobleaching, PMA in the five jaundiced patients
was 52% lower than values in five age- and sex-matched normal
controls. After photobleaching, PMA in the jaundiced patients
increased to values that were virtually identical with those of
the normal controls. Because of the small number of subjects,
this increase was not significant by the paired t test but was
significant (P = 0.02) by the sign test. In the normal controls,
photobleaching had no apparent effect on PMA.
Discussion
Although normal hOB cells grow well in 10% fetal calf serum
(14, 15), their ability to proliferate in normal human plasma
has not been reported previously. We found that hOB cell prolif￾eration in normal human plasma was greater than in fetal calf
serum at an equal concentration. This observation formed the
basis of a new bioassay for PMA that we used in this study.
Using this bioassay, we explored plasma factor(s) retained
during cholestasis that might impair osteoblast proliferation.
First, we found that PMA in patients with CCLD was approxi￾mately half that of age- and sex-matched normal controls. This
finding was significant despite a wide distribution of PMA

apparent effect on that of normal subjects.
among normal subjects. This high variability may be related to
the variability of circulating endogenous growth factors among
subjects. Also, it may be related in part to release of growth
factors that are mitogenic for osteoblasts from platelets, such
as platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth fac￾tor-,8. Some degree of platelet degranulation is inevitable in
collection of plasma using citrate. However, despite the wide
variation of PMA in nonnal subjects, PMA fell below the mean
for the normal controls in all except one of the CCLD patients,
and 21 of the 29 of the CCLD patients had values for PMA
that were lower than all but one of the normal controls. The
reduced PMA for osteoblasts in vitro is consistent with the
reduced bone formation in CCLD patients as documented by
decreased levels of serum osteocalcin (10, 13) and by bone
histomorphometry (8, 11-13).
We next assessed the effect on PMA of the addition of
graded concentrations of major products retained during chole￾stasis-bile acids and bilirubin-to pooled normal plasma.
Adding bile acids, alone or in combination, in concentrations
spanning the range observed in the serum of patients with
CCLD, had no effect on plasma mitogenic activity. However,
when unconjugated bilirubin was added, we found a highly
significant, reproducible, and dose-dependent reduction in os￾teoblast proliferation in vitro. Because of lack of an available
preparation, we were unable to determine if conjugated bilirubin
also decreased osteoblast proliferation and thus also could con￾tribute to the decreased bone formation in patients with CCLD.
However, there was no correlation between PMA and the total
bilirubin concentration for the individual normal and CCLD
plasma samples. We believe that the relationship between PMA
and serum bilirubin concentration could be observed in the
dose-response experiment because known amounts of a single
bilirubin species were being added to a constant concentration
of growth factors in the same plasma pool whereas for individ￾ual plasma samples it was not observed because of the wide
variation in endogenous or platelet-released growth factor con￾centration among them in the presence of multiple bilirubin
species in addition to unconjugated bilirubin.
2584 Janes et al.

Finally, in a small subset of normal subjects and jaundiced
patients, we assessed the effect of relatively selective removal
of bilirubin and its metabolites by photobleaching of plasma
with narrow spectrum blue light -a process that totally removes
bilirubin but is unlikely to affect plasma proteins. Although the
sample was too small for adequate statistical analysis, photo￾bleaching appeared to restore the depressed plasma mitogenic
activity in the jaundiced patients but had no apparent effect on
plasma mitogenic activity in the normal subjects. Although the
photobleaching also could have affected other plasma compo￾nents that may regulate osteoblast activity, such as vitamin D
sterols and retinoids, the lack of change in PMA after photo￾bleaching in the five normal controls argues against this. How￾ever, we cannot exclude the possibility that photolabile sub￾stances accumulated with cholestasis other than bilirubin also
affect osteoblast proliferation.
Our finding that unconjugated bilirubin inhibits the prolifer￾ation of normal hOB cells is consistent with results in other
types of cells in which inhibition or toxic effects have been
observed (24-30). However, in the dose-response experiment,
we found no evidence of increased cell death as assessed by
failure to exclude trypan blue at higher concentrations of biliru￾bin. Although the mechanism of bilirubin inhibition of osteo￾blastic proliferation is not clear, the saturable dose-response is
consistent with binding to cell surface receptors.
Decreased bone mineral density in the lumbar spine has
been reported to correlate with severity index for liver disease
(as assessed by a score based on multiple risk factors) in 210
PBC (5) and 37 PSC patients (4). Diamond et al. (13) reported
in 80 patients with various liver disorders including 20 with
CCLD that serum albumin correlated weakly with histologically
assessed bone formation rate whereas serum bilirubin did not.
However, serum bilirubin did correlate inversely with serum
osteocalcin, a biochemical marker of bone formation. Because
serum albumin concentration is one of the major contributing
factors to the severity index (31), the correlation indicates that
the decrease in bone formation rate is associated with advanced
stages of liver disease and that factors associated with advanced
liver disease in addition to bilirubin may also contribute to the
development of the osteopenia associated with CCLD. Potential
contributing factors include malabsorption of calcium and vita￾min D and retention of other toxic factors.
The association of osteoporosis and decreased bone forma￾tion with chronic liver disease has been reported chiefly in
patients with CCLD. However, we found that plasma from pa￾tients with jaundice due to other causes also had a decrease in
PMA to a similar degree for a comparable plasma concentration
of bilirubin. This suggests that depressed osteoblast function
may be related to the jaundice itself and is not a specific hall￾mark of CCLD. Possibly, severe jaundice develops at such a
late stage in patients with hepatocellular disease that they do
not survive long enough for osteoporosis to develop, whereas,
in patients with CCLD, hepatic synthesis is well preserved,
despite severe jaundice, until late in the course of the liver
disease.
Of interest, osteoporosis has not been reported in patients
with constitutional hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert, Crigler-NaJar,
Dubin-Johnson, and Rotor syndromes). However, patients with
these syndromes have not been studied by sensitive techniques
such as bone densitometry to assess bone loss. Also, patients
with Gilbert's syndrome generally have lower serum bilirubin
concentrations, and our studies indicate that the toxic effect of
bilirubin on osteoblastic function is dose related.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the utility of a new
bioassay for PMA and shows that PMA is depressed in patients
with chronic liver disease. The results show that unconjugated
bilirubin has a marked inhibitory effect on the PMA activity of
plasma in vitro and provide strong experimental support for the
hypothesis that hyperbilirubinemia, or accumulated photolabile
substances, impairs osteoblast proliferative capacity and, thus,
may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the osteoporo￾sis associated with chronic jaundice.
