Abstract
Hypertension is highly prevalent among renal transplant recipients (RTR) and a risk factor for graft failure and cardiovascular events. Pro￾tein intake has been claimed to affect blood pressure (BP) in the general population and may affect renal function. We examined the
association of dietary protein with BP and renal function in RTR. We included 625 RTR (age 53 (SD 13) years; 57 % male). Protein
intake was assessed with a FFQ, differentiating between animal and plant protein. BP was measured according to a strict protocol. Crea￾tinine clearance and albuminuria were measured as renal parameters. Protein intake was 83 (SD 12) g/d, of which 63 % derived from animal
sources. BP was 136 (SD 17) mmHg systolic (SBP) and 83 (SD 11) mmHg diastolic (DBP). Creatinine clearance was 66 (SD 26) ml/min; albu￾minuria 41 (10–178) mg/24 h. An inverse, though statistically insignificant, association was found between the total protein intake and both
SBP (b ¼ 22·22 mmHg per SD, P¼0·07) and DBP (b ¼ 20·48 mmHg per SD, P¼0.5). Protein intake was not associated with creatinine
clearance. Although albuminuria was slightly higher in the highest tertile of animal protein intake compared with the lowest tertile
(66 v. 33 mg/d, respectively, P¼0·03), linear regression analyses did not reveal significant associations between dietary protein and albu￾minuria. Protein intake exceeded the current recommendations. Nevertheless, within the range of protein intake in our RTR population, we
found no evidence for an association of dietary protein with BP and renal function. Intervention studies focusing on different protein types
are warranted to clarify their effect on BP and renal function in RTR.
Key words: Protein intake: Renal transplantation: Blood pressure
High blood pressure (BP) is a serious health problem after
renal transplantation(1–3). It is an important risk factor for
graft failure, cardiovascular events and mortality in renal
transplant recipients (RTR)(3,4), and usually requires multiple
antihypertensives to ensure adequate BP control. Remarkably,
the mechanisms and treatment of high BP in RTR are poorly
defined and management is largely derived from data in
non-transplant populations. Better elucidation of the mecha￾nisms underlying high BP in RTR is urgently needed, as
emphasised recently(5). Data in non-transplant populations
consistently demonstrate an important role of diet and lifestyle
in BP. Well-established dietary factors that favourably affect BP
in the general population are weight reduction, reduced salt
intake, moderation of alcohol intake and increased K
intake(6), and in non-transplant renal patients dietary salt
restriction(7,8). In a first study on BP and dietary factors in
RTR, we have recently reported a positive association between
Na intake and BP(9), suggesting that modification of dietary
factors can beneficially influence BP in addition to pharmaco￾logical BP regimens. Currently, interest is growing in the influ￾ence of dietary patterns and macronutrient intake, including
protein, on BP. Dietary protein has also been claimed to
affect BP, but the large body of literature on dietary protein
and BP in the general population(10–16) is not consistent. In
renal patients, dietary protein can affect renal haemodynamics
as well as renal protein loss, hence modifying the course of

long-term renal damage(7–10). By these mechanisms, dietary
protein might also affect BP. Concern exists that high protein
intake induces high intraglomerular pressure and concurrent
hyperfiltration, eventually leading to kidney damage and sub￾sequent hypertension(17,18). Although data from intervention
studies applying protein restriction in chronic kidney disease
were not entirely conclusive(19,20), dietary recommendations
for patients with chronic kidney disease advocate a protein
intake of 0·6–0·8 g/kg per d, to decrease renal workload and
help delay the progression of kidney failure(21).
Considering the vast body of studies on dietary protein in
chronic kidney disease, surprisingly little data are available
on the impact of dietary protein in RTR. Data on dietary
habits, and on associations of dietary protein with BP and
renal function in RTR are virtually lacking, and consequently,
the empirical basis for the few available dietary guidelines
regarding protein intake for RTR is virtually absent(22,23).
Consequently, it remains unclear, for medical practitioners
as well as for RTR, what the optimal level and favourable
source of dietary protein are in this population(24).
In the present study, therefore, we aimed to clarify the
relationship of protein with BP and renal function in stable
RTR. For this purpose, we examined dietary habits, and ana￾lysed whether the intakes of total protein and types of protein
(plant and animal) were associated with BP and renal func￾tion, in a cross-sectional analysis in a Dutch patient-based
cohort of 625 RTR with a functioning graft for at least 1 year.
Methods
Design and study population
We conducted an observational study to perform cross￾sectional analyses in a large, single-centre RTR cohort. We
invited all RTR ($18 years) with a functioning graft for at
least 1 year who visited our outpatient clinic between
November 2008 and March 2011. RTR were all transplanted
in our centre, had sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language
and had no history of drug or alcohol addiction, as reported in
their patient files. RTR were on standard antihypertensive and
immunosuppressive therapy. Of 817 initially invited RTR, 707
(87 %) signed written informed consent to participate in the
present study. We excluded all patients with missing dietary
data, leaving 625 RTR eligible for analysis. The study was con￾ducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declara￾tion of Helsinki and all procedures involving human
subjects/patients were approved by the Institutional Review
Board (METc 2008/186). The routine regimen included no
specific dietary counselling, except for discouraging excess
Na intake and encouraging losing weight in overweight indi￾viduals. Patients with diabetes were counselled as appropriate
to adapt their dietary habits to achieve normoglycaemia.
Assessment of protein intake
Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative FFQ that
inquired about the intake of 177 food items during the last
month. For each item, the frequency was recorded in times
per d, week or month. The number of servings per frequency
was expressed in natural units (for example, slice of bread or
apple) or household measures (for example, cup or spoon).
The questionnaire was self-administered and filled out at
home. At the day of the visit to the outpatient clinic, all FFQ
were checked for completeness by a trained researcher and
inconsistent answers were verified with the patients. Total
energy and nutrient intake per d was calculated using a com￾puterised Dutch food composition table taking seasonal vari￾ation into account(25). Because RTR have only sparsely been
subject to nutritional studies thus far, we checked consistency
of our data on protein intake in our population by comparing
the estimated protein intake with 24 h urinary urea excretion.
Therefore, all participants were carefully instructed to collect a
24 h urine sample according to a strict protocol. Urinary urea
excretion was considered as a marker reflecting dietary total
protein intake and was used to calculate protein intake
according to the method of Maroni and colleagues taking
also proteinuria into account (protein intake (g/d) ¼ (0·18 £
urinary urea excretion in mmol per 24 h) þ 15 þ urinary pro￾tein excretion in g per 24 h)(26,27). In addition, excretion of
several urinary components was measured to infer dietary
intake of additional dietary nutrients such as Na and K.
Outcome measurements
All measurements were performed during a morning visit to
the outpatient clinic. Fasting BP (mmHg) was measured
according to a strict protocol. Participants were left alone in
a room in half-sitting position while systolic BP (SBP), diastolic
BP (DBP) and mean arterial pressure were measured with a
semi-automatic device (Dinamapw 1846; Critikon). Measure￾ments were performed every minute for 15 min and values
of the last three measurements were averaged.
Blood was drawn after an 8–12 h overnight fasting period in
the morning after completion of 24 h urine collection. Renal
function was assessed by 24 h urinary creatinine clearance
(ml/min), calculated as time-factored urinary creatinine con￾centration (mg/min) divided by plasma creatinine concen￾tration (mg/ml). Serum creatinine levels were determined
using a modified version of the Jaffe´ method (MEGA AU
510; Merck Diagnostica). Plasma and urinary concentrations
of electrolytes and urea were measured using routine clinical
laboratory methods, as were serum cholesterol and HbA1c.
Urinary albumin concentration was determined by nephelo￾metry (Dade Behring Diagnostic). Total urinary protein con￾centration was analysed using the Biuret reaction (MEGA AU
510; Merck Diagnostica). Proteinuria was defined as urinary
protein excretion $0·5 g/24 h.
Collection of risk factor data
Information on patients’ health status, medical history and
medication use was obtained from patient records. Question￾naires were used to obtain information on smoking behaviour
and alcohol intake. Participants were classified as current
smokers, former smokers or never smokers. Alcohol intake
was assessed based on a self-reported number of beverages

consumed weekly, converted into g ethanol/d and divided
into quartiles (no alcohol, 0–10 g/d, 10–30 g/d and .30 g/d).
Body weight and height were measured with participants
wearing indoor clothing without shoes. BMI was calculated
as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2
).
Statistical analyses
Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 18.0 software
(SPSS, Inc.). Normality was tested with the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test and skewed data were normalised by logarithmic
transformation (i.e. albuminuria and proteinuria). Protein
intake (total, plant and animal) was adjusted for total energy
intake according to the residual method which is based on
an isoenergetic principle(28). Characteristics of the study popu￾lation and data on dietary intake were calculated in tertiles of
energy-adjusted total protein intake. Data are presented as
means and standard deviations, unless stated otherwise.
We used multivariable linear regression models to obtain
the regression coefficients for BP and renal parameters per
SD of energy-adjusted protein intake (total, plant and animal)
in RTR. Our basic model (model 1) included age (continuous)
and sex. In the second model, we further adjusted for BMI
(continuous), SBP (continuous; only applied in analyses for
the association between protein intake and renal function),
smoking behaviour (never/ever/current), alcohol consump￾tion (no alcohol, 0–10 g/d, 10–30 g/d and .30 g/d), use of
antihypertensive medication (number of drugs; continuous)
and time since transplantation (years; continuous). In the
final model, we additionally adjusted for total energy intake
(continuous; kJ/d), urinary Na, K (all continuous; mmol/
24 h), intake of Ca, Mg (continuous; mg/d), carbohydrates,
SFA and PUFA (all continuous; g/d).
To allow for non-linear associations, general linear model
analyses were used to investigate the associations of tertiles
of energy-adjusted protein intake (total, plant and animal)
with BP and renal function in RTR. Per tertile of energy￾adjusted protein intake, the estimated mean values of BP, crea￾tinine clearance and albuminuria were calculated as well as
the P-trend across tertiles. Multivariable analyses were
repeated with aforementioned adjustments. Within all statisti￾cal analyses, a two-sided P value less than 0·05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
Population characteristics
The mean age of the present study population was 53 (SD 13)
years and 57 % were male. Mean BMI was 26·7 (SD 4·8) kg/m2
,
with 59 % of the patients being overweight. Mean SBP was 136
(SD 17) mmHg, mean DBP was 83 (SD 11) mmHg and 91 % of
the cohort had hypertension (i.e. BP $140/90 mmHg or use of
antihypertensive medication). Of the 625 RTR, seventy-two
(11 %) were not using any antihypertensive drugs, while 198
(30 %) used one antihypertensive drug, 231 (35 %) used two
and 159 (24 %) used three or more different antihypertensive
drugs. Calcineurin inhibitors were used in 57 % of RTR,
2 % of RTR used mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors
and 83 % of RTR were on proliferation inhibiting therapy.
The median prednisolone dose was 10 (7·5–10·0) mg/d.
The diet contained 83 (SD 12) g/d of energy-adjusted protein
(corresponding to 15·5 % of an individual’s total energy
intake (en%) or 1·1 (SD 0·3) g/kg per d), of which 52 (SD 13) g/d
(9·9 en%) derived from animal origin and 31 (SD 6) g/d (5·7 en%)
from plant origin (mean animal:plant ratio approximately 2:1).
The distribution of plant protein intake and animal protein
intake per group of total protein intake (g/d) is shown in
Fig. 1. The percentage of protein intake declined from
57 % in the lowest group to 28 % in the highest group. The
animal:plant ratio in the lowest group of total protein intake
was 0·75 v. 2·5 in the highest group of total protein intake.
Based on the Maroni formula, total protein intake was
85 (SD 21) g/d (approximately 1·1 (SD 0·3) g/kg per d), which
did not significantly differ from the protein estimate derived
from the FFQ (P¼0·3). The mean intake of energy, Ca, Mg
and P were 9100 (SD 2665) kJ/d 2175 (SD 637) kcal/d, 1049
(SD 378) mg/d, 331 (SD 90) mg/d and 1521 (SD 331) mg/d
respectively. The mean urinary excretion of Na and K was
157 (SD 62) and 73 (SD 24) mmol/24 h, respectively. Of the
energy intake, 36 en% derived from fat (saturated fat 13 en%;
monounsaturated fat 12 en%; polyunsaturated fat 8 en%) and
46 en% came from carbohydrates. The mean intake of fibre
was 22 (SD 7) g/d.
The patient characteristics by tertiles of total energy￾adjusted protein intake are shown in Table 1. RTR in the high￾est tertile of energy-adjusted protein intake were likely to be
older, to have a higher BMI and higher urinary urea excretion
levels, whereas the prevalence of males and smokers was
lower with higher energy-adjusted protein intake. With
higher protein intake, RTR tended to increase the intake
of animal protein rather than that of plant protein, both in
absolute (g/d) and relative (en%) amounts.

Protein intake and blood pressure
Intake of energy-adjusted protein (total, animal and plant)
tended to be inversely associated with BP, although the level
of significance was not reached (Table 2). After adjustment
for potential confounders, the regression coefficients for SBP
were 22·22 (P¼0·07), 21·07 (P¼0·37) and 21·41 (P¼0·19)
per SD increase of total, animal and plant protein, respectively.
On secondary regression analyses with tertiles of energy￾adjusted protein intake (total, animal and plant) instead of
with continuous values of protein intake, in that way forcing
more contrast in protein intake, the findings remained essen￾tially similar. The median total protein intake in the lowest ter￾tile was 73·0 g/d compared with 94·0 g/d in the highest tertile.
Although SBP was 3·9 mmHg lower in the highest tertile of
protein intake (133·8 v. 137·7 mmHg in the lowest tertile),
this difference did not reach statistical significance (P¼0·2).
Similar trends were found for the associations of animal and
plant protein with BP (data not shown).
Protein intake and renal function
Table 3 shows the regression coefficients for the association
between energy-adjusted protein intake (total, animal and
plant) and renal function, reflected by creatinine clearance, albu￾minuria and proteinuria. The total protein intake was signifi￾cantly associated with creatinine clearance, independent of age
and sex (b ¼ 2·17 per SD increase of protein intake; P¼0·05).
However, the fully adjusted models for the association between
protein intake and creatinine clearance yielded insignificant
regression coefficients of 0·19ml/min (P¼0·9), 0·17ml/min
(P¼0·9) and 0·03ml/min (P¼0·9) per SD increase of total,
animal and plant protein, respectively. Also, protein intake was
not associated with albuminuria or proteinuria in this RTR
cohort, regardless of both protein type and the adjustments
that were made (Table 3). In order to consider the effect
of calcineurin inhibitors, we also performed an adjustment for
calcineurin inhibitors use in linear regression analyses, which
did not essentially change the findings in the complete cohort.

Impact of dietary protein in renal patients 1467

With tertiles of energy-adjusted protein intake (total, animal
and plant) rather than continuous variables, the results were
essentially similar; creatinine clearance was 62·4 ml/min in
the lowest tertile of energy-adjusted protein intake (median
intake 73·0 g/d) v. 66·3 ml/min in the highest tertile of
energy-adjusted protein intake (median intake 94·0 g/d;
P-trend¼0·2). Also, differentiation between animal and plant
protein did not alter previous findings (data not shown).
With albuminuria, we did not observe significant differences
across increasing tertiles of total protein intake (P¼0·15).
However, with respect to the intake of energy-adjusted
animal protein, a significant trend was found. The highest ter￾tile, with a median protein intake of 63 g/d, had 66 mg/24 h
albuminuria, compared with 33 mg/24 h albuminuria in the
lowest tertile with a median animal protein intake of 41 g/d
(P-trend¼0·03). This was independent of age, sex, BMI, SBP,
smoking behaviour, alcohol intake, antihypertensive drugs,
time since transplantation and dietary factors. These differ￾ences in albuminuria were not seen across tertiles of plant
protein intake.
Discussion
To date, no evidence is available regarding the optimal level
of protein intake and its favourable source (i.e. animal or
plant protein) in stable RTR. Therefore, we examined dietary
habits in RTR, with the main purpose to study whether dietary
protein was associated with BP and renal function parameters
in a large, single-centre RTR cohort. In the present analyses
among 625 RTR with a functioning graft for at least 1 year,
the average protein intake was 83 (SD 12) g/d (approximately
1·1 (SD 0·3) g/kg per d), thus exceeding the recommended
values for RTR. The intake of other relevant dietary factors,
i.e. Na, P, fibre and intake and composition of fat, was not
in compliance with dietary recommendations either. Dietary
protein (total, plant and animal) was not associated with BP
or creatinine clearance. Although an adverse renal effect of
animal protein intake was suggested by a higher albuminuria
in the highest tertile of animal protein intake compared with
the lowest tertile, no continuous relationship was found in
linear regression analysis.
This is the first study providing detailed information on
dietary habits in RTR. Several methodological aspects of the
nutritional assessment deserve to be addressed. First, esti￾mation of animal and plant protein intake was assessed by
FFQ, based on self-report, which may have led to misclassifi￾cation due to inadequacies in dietary recall. However, esti￾mations of total protein intake based on FFQ were similar to
estimations based on urinary urea excretion. We therefore
do not expect much bias from misclassification regarding
animal and plant protein either. Additionally, during the
study, a dietary diary was kept for three consecutive days in
a subgroup of sixty RTR and dietary data of both FFQ and dia￾ries were compared. Pearson’s correlations between FFQ and
diaries were 0·72 for energy intake, 0·64 for protein intake,
0·50 for fat intake and 0·69 for carbohydrate intake. These cor￾relation coefficients were comparable with those observed in
previous studies analysing the validity of FFQ in population￾based cohort studies(29). Second, the present analyses are
based on cross-sectional data with protein intake and BP
being measured at the same moment. This makes it difficult
to assess the temporal relationships in a potential association.
For instance, patients with renal function decline might restrict
their protein intake, which might have manipulated potential
associations. This is, however, unlikely, because no active
intervention on protein intake is advocated in RTR when
renal function decreases, until dialysis is restarted, to prevent
induction of protein malnutrition in the face of continued
immunosuppression. Third, it might be hypothesised that, as
a result of heterogeneity of the RTR population (e.g. pharma￾cological regimens, diversity in allograft vintage), significant
associations of dietary protein with BP might go unnoticed.
However, despite possible blurring of potential associations
due to these factors, classical factors associated with BP in
the general population such as age, sex, BMI and Na intake
were significantly positively associated with BP in our RTR

population(9), thus supporting the power of the present study
to identify determinants of BP in the current clinical context.
The strengths of the present study include the fact that, to
our knowledge, this is the first study examining the
association of dietary protein with BP and renal function in
a large, stable RTR population, with the obvious limitation,
however, of its single-centre nature that limits its generalisabil￾ity. Extensive data collection made it possible to adjust for
many potential confounders, including Na intake reflected
by urinary Na excretion. Previous studies, in line with the pre￾sent study, have shown a firm and inextricable association
between protein intake and Na intake cross-sectionally(8,30),
which therefore makes it difficult to distinguish between the
effects of the separate dietary components on BP and renal
function.
Our dietary inventory allows a detailed assessment of the
dietary habits of the RTR population, albeit in a single-centre
set-up. The dietary habits of our RTR generally are not quite
optimal, as shown from their intake of macronutrients as
well as Na and P, which deviate from the available recommen￾dations. Accordingly, dietary habits can be considered logical
targets for intervention in RTR, but this renders it all the more
important to reinforce the empirical basis in this population.
Protein intake and blood pressure
No significant associations of dietary protein with BP in RTR
were seen, which suggests that dietary protein, within the
range of intake in our population, is well tolerated in stable
RTR. However, it might be hypothesised that the absence of
a significant association is explained by the relatively small
range of protein intake in our population. The SD of unad￾justed mean total protein intake in RTR was 20 g/d, which is
smaller than the SD of 27 g/d in a big sample of the Dutch gen￾eral population(31). RTR usually have a history of long-term
exposure to strict dietary restrictions, especially during the
dialysis period, and this may have modulated the eating
habits of this specific population to a fairly homogeneous pat￾tern, which could mask a potential association of protein
intake with BP. Nevertheless, repeating our multivariate ana￾lyses in tertiles instead of per SD, forcing more contrast in
exposure, did not reveal significant associations either.
Future studies could include RTR from different populations
and countries to acquire a larger variation in protein intake
or intervene on protein intake, by isoenergetic exchange for
other macronutrients.
Protein and renal function
The potentially deleterious effect of dietary protein on renal
function, suggested by several previous studies(17,18,32–34), is
ascribed to the induction of high intraglomerular pressure
and concurrent hyperfiltration. This adverse phenomenon of
dietary protein was not so pronounced in the present study
in stable RTR, as appears from the non-significant regression
coefficients resulting from the present statistical analyses. We
did not see higher creatinine clearance or higher albuminuria
or proteinuria in RTR with a higher total protein intake.
However, a slightly, but significantly, higher albuminuria
was seen in the highest tertile of animal protein, independent
of age, sex, BMI, BP and dietary factors such as energy and Na
intake. This significant association was not seen in tertiles of
plant protein, suggesting that it is not protein per se that
could influence albuminuria, but that differences exist
between types of protein. One other study addressing the
association between protein intake and renal function in
RTR was performed by Bernardi et al. They studied the role
of long-term dietary protein restriction on renal graft function
in forty-two post-transplant patients with signs of chronic
rejection(33). Patients with moderate protein intake (0·73
(SD 0·11) g/kg) maintained unchanged renal graft function,
whereas patients with a high-protein diet (1·4 (SD 0·23) g/kg)
ended up with a significantly lower graft function. However,
during enrolment, all patients received similar dietary rec￾ommendations and compliance with protein restriction was
not pre-specified but based on urinary urea excretion. At the
end of the study, patients were compared in two groups stra￾tified by compliance status. Moreover, the low-protein diet
was provided in combination with a low-Na and low-lipid
diet which makes it complicated to isolate the effects of mod￾erate protein intake on renal function.
In conclusion, we found no clear-cut association of dietary
protein with BP or creatinine clearance within the ranges of
protein intake in our population consisting of 625 stable
RTR. Although RTR in the highest tertile of animal protein
intake had a higher urinary albumin excretion compared
with RTR in the lowest tertile, no continuous association
was found between animal protein intake and albuminuria.
In general, dietary habits in our RTR deviated from the avail￾able guidelines, with intake of protein, saturated fat, Na and
P being higher, and intake of polyunsaturated fat, carbo￾hydrates and fibre being lower than recommended. These
data prompt for further studies addressing the role of dietary
factors in the cardiovascular and renal risk in RTR, including
the effects of intervention studies.
