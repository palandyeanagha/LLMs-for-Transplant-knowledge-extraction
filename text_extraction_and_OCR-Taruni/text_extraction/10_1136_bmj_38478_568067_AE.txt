Evidence for optimal perioperative care in colorectal
surgery is abundant. By avoiding fasting, intravenous
fluid overload, and activation of the neuroendocrine
stress response, postoperative catabolism is reduced
and recovery enhanced. The specific measures that can
be used routinely include no bowel preparation,
epidural anaesthesia/analgesia continued for one to
two days postoperatively, no nasogastric decompres￾sion tube postoperatively, intravenous fluid/saline
restriction, and free oral intake from postoperative day
one.1–5 This survey aimed to characterise perioperative
practice in colorectal cancer surgery in five northern
European countries: Scotland, the Netherlands, Den￾mark, Sweden, and Norway.
Participants, methods, and results
We mailed a questionnaire to the head surgeons of all
digestive surgical centres in the five countries of the
departments belonging to the Enhanced Recovery
After Surgery (ERAS) Group in late spring 2003. We
presented a hypothetical case of elective laparotomy
with colonic resection for cancer in an otherwise
healthy 70 year old man. We asked the respondents to
answer according to the practice most widely used in
their department at that time.
The table shows the results (fuller version on
bmj.com). Response rate was 76% (200 centres). Oral
bowel preparation was still the rule in all countries. The
nasogastric decompression tube was widely used post￾operatively only in the Netherlands. “Nil by mouth” was
hardly used in Scandinavia but was common in the
Netherlands and Scotland. By postoperative day one,
patients ate at will in 85% of Danish units and in almost
half of units in Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden.
In Scotland, only a quarter of units allowed free eating
on day one. The use of epidural analgesia in general

Comment
Perioperative routines in colorectal cancer treatment in
northern Europe differ substantially from evidence
based practice. Patients are uniformly subjected to the
unpleasant, unnecessary, and harmful practice of
preoperative bowel preparation,1 precluding oral
nutrition and increasing dependency on intravenous
fluids. For too many patients, the situation is
aggravated as nasogastric tubes are left in place for too
long, patients are kept nil by mouth too long,
intravenous fluids are administered unrestrictedly, and
adequate blocking of pain and afferent stress stimuli is
not provided.
The Dutch have implemented postoperative
epidural anaesthesia/analgesia in general wards, and
their patients should thus be optimally prepared to
tolerate a normal diet soon after surgery.2 5 Neverthe￾less, in almost half the Dutch centres nasogastric tubes
were left in place for two days or more. Of centres
where nasogastric tubes were removed early, a third
still prescribed nil by mouth for at least a day. Approxi￾mately 25% of Dutch centres did not allow patients to
eat solid food at will until bowel movements occurred,
and many did not even allow fluids. One could argue
that the Dutch have introduced a novel modality but
failed to exploit its major potential. In Scotland, a con￾servative view by anaesthetists prevented patients with
epidural anaesthesia/analgesia being nursed outside
of high dependency units. This may also have caused
the Scottish centres to practise nil by mouth more
widely than the others and to withhold both fluids and
solids accordingly, although it contrasts with available
evidence.5
A restricted fluid regimen aiming at unchanged
body weight may reduce complications after elective
colorectal surgery.4 Scotland had the only substantial
group claiming such practice. However, the volume of
fluids allowed (table) indicates an inadequate reduction
as it is twice as high as in the unrestricted (standard)
group in the study by Brandstrup et al (median
1500 ml/24 hours).4
In spite of a large evidence base for perioperative
care aiming to alleviate postoperative catabolism and
organ dysfunction, surgical patients remain exposed to
unnecessary starvation, suboptimal stress reduction,
and fluid overload.

What is already known on this topic
For colonic surgery, current evidence advocates no
bowel preparation, epidural anaesthesia/analgesia
for 1-2 days postoperatively, no nasogastric
decompression tube postoperatively, avoidance of
sodium/water overload, and free oral intake from
postoperative day one
What this study adds
Perioperative routines in colonic cancer surgery
differ widely in northern Europe and deviate
considerably from the best available evidence
Taking histories—theft by clinicians
Medical education now stresses the importance of partnership
between health professionals and patients. The hierarchical
model of the doctor-patient relationship is old fashioned and
inappropriate.
So why do we still tell students to “take a history” from patients?
Does this phrase undermine our efforts to teach about
collaboration? Shouldn’t we instead “listen to people’s stories”?
This would emphasise the importance of meeting the patient in
his or her world and context and ensure that the start of the
medical consultation does not perpetuate an outmoded and
ineffective world view.
