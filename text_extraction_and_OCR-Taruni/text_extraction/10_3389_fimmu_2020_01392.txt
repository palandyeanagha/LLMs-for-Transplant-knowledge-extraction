Since December 2019, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
has significantly affected solid organ transplantation (SOT) worldwide and has become a
threat to the lives of SOT recipients. Here, we have reviewed, condensed, and organized
the available information on COVID-19 to provide recommendations to transplant
healthcare workers. Our review of reported cases shows that the symptoms of SOT
patients with COVID-19 are similar to those of the normal population, but their severity
and outcomes are worse. Thus far, there is no evidence that severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly causes permanent damage to kidney,
liver, or heart allografts.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were reported (1).
The pathogen was promptly isolated on January 7, 2020 and its whole genome was shared later on
January 12, which identified it as a novel member of the β coronavirus family (2, 3). On February 11,
2020 this virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (4); on the same day the disease caused
by SARS-CoV-2 was named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by the WHO (5). On March 11,
2020, the WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic (6), and
as of April 17, 2020, nearly 2,074,529 cases and 139,378 deaths have been confirmed worldwide (7).
Droplet and contact transmission are the main routes of viral transmission; airborne
transmission is only possible in specific circumstances such as endotracheal intubation,
bronchoscopy, and open suctioning (8, 9). Although SARS-CoV-2 has been cultured from the stool
(10), fecal–oral transmission has not been reported. The general population lacks immunity and
is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 due to the novelty of the virus. The average incubation period for
COVID-19 is 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1–7.0) with the 95th percentile at 12.5 days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) value has been estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4–3.9) (11).
It should be noted that asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 account for 1.2% of the infected
cases according to a retrospective study of 72,314 confirmed cases in China (12). Other studies
have concluded that the percentage of asymptomatic patients range from 8.6 to 15.7% (13). Further,
evidence indicates that asymptomatic patients can also transmit the disease (14, 15).
The spread of COVID-19 has significantly restricted the transplantation program in epidemic
areas due to the high risk of infection in immunosuppressed patients, risk of transmission in health
workers, impact of travel bans on organ procurement organizations’ (OPO) activities, and lack
of medical resources in certain circumstances. In this paper, we explore ways to safely continue
transplantation under the threat of COVID-19 and review the current reported cases of organ
transplant in COVID-19 patients.

Zhang et al. Organ Transplant During COVID-19
ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDS
WITH EXTRA PRECAUTIONS IN LOW-RISK
AREAS
Transplant Activity Report During the
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, organ transplant centers in Wuhan completely
halted all transplant surgeries. A suspension on living donor
transplants, pancreas transplants, and renal transplants was first
considered in other less affected regions; however, lifesaving
urgent transplant surgery still proceeded in most centers (16,
17). Statistics showed a drastic 90.6% and 51.1% reduction in
deceased donor transplant in France and USA, respectively,
which is mostly driven by kidney transplant (18). Total amount
of all organ transplants reduced from 100∼150 to 40 transplants
per month in Netherlands (19). Kumar et al. have suggested
a phase down approach to new transplant activity during
this unprecedented crisis. The percentage of transplant activity
reduction should be based on risk tolerance, the degree of
local COVID-19 activity, and medical resource capacity (20).
Generally, according to the transmission patterns defined by
the World Health Organization (21), when sporadic cases and
clusters of cases with clear traceable transmission chains are
present, transplantation can be performed with precautions.
However, in regions where community transmission (large
number of untraceable cases) is on the rise, a temporary
tiered suspension on transplantation is recommended due to
increased amount of infection risk among patients and healthcare
workers (22).
Donor and Recipient Screening
No donor-derived COVID-19 case has been reported thus far.
Although 10.4–15% of COVID-19 patients have been detected
with serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia), no infectious
live virus has been found in the blood (23, 24). Angiotensin￾converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been identified as a
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (25), is abundant in virtually all organs
including the lung, kidney, liver, heart, and intestine (26); this
implies that SARS-CoV-2 viremia could possibly infect any
transplant organ and conceal itself until the immunosuppressed
status exists. Postmortem autopsy has shown that SARS-CoV￾2 mainly exists in the lungs (27, 28), although involvement
of the kidney, liver, and heart has also been reported (29,
30). Considering the real risk of donor-derived infection under
immunosuppression and the risk of viral transmission to
health workers during coordination, procurement, surgery, and
nursing, both donor and recipient screening should be mandated
in the affected areas.
Due to the existence of asymptomatic patients, clinical
screening methods such as inquiry into potential exposure and
suspected symptoms, laboratory blood examination, or a chest
computed tomography (CT) (31) are not sufficient to completely
rule out the possibility of infection. A nucleic acid test (NAT)
remains the cornerstone of COVID-19 screening. The positive
rate using nasopharyngeal swabs (63%) is lower than that
using the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93%) and the sputum
(72%), but is significantly higher than using oropharyngeal
swabs (32%); nasopharyngeal swabs have the highest viral load
among all types of clinical specimens (32). Because of its
accessibility and sensitivity, NAT nasopharyngeal swabs are
preferred for screening purposes (33). Universal NAT testing
should be recommended in community transmission areas (20,
22). However, due to high false negative rate of one-time NAT
testing, if feasible, two consecutive NAT tests conducted ≥24 h
apart should be considered (34, 35).
However, when life-saving urgent transplantation is required
and NAT kits are limited, testing should be done in the
following order of priority: suspected donor/recipient, donor,
and recipient, because the donors have a higher exposure
risk (ICU experience for instance) compared with low￾risk recipients who follow social distancing rules. Suspected
donor/recipient cases (different from the suspected cases for
epidemiological surveillance purposes) are determined based on
the following (36–38):
• Possible exposure to COVID-19 confirmed or
suspected patients.
• Suspected symptoms such as fever (reported symptom
prevalence: 83–99%), cough (59–82%), fatigue (44–70%),
anorexia (40–84%), shortness of breath (31–40%), sputum
production (28–33%), and myalgias (11–35%).
• Conditions such as lymphocytopenia (83.2%),
thrombocytopenia (36.2%), and leukopenia (33.7%).
• Abnormal CT results (86.2%) with ground-glass opacity
(56.4%), and bilateral patchy shadows (51.8%).
Any suspected donor/recipient (who fulfills any of the
above conditions) should be screened by NAT for SARS
COV-2. Any COVID-19 confirmed donor/recipient,
suspected donor/recipient unable to rule out COVID-19,
and donor/recipient with fever of unknown cause should be
contraindicated for organ transplant.
Safety of OPO Coordinators
In regions where organ transplant programs are still ongoing,
OPO coordinators generally have to travel more compared with
transplant doctors and nurses and social contact is unavoidable. It
is thus essential to impart training on epidemiology, prevention,
risk assessment of COVID-19, and psychological tutoring on
stress coping (39). Coordinators should perform risk assessment
depending on the epidemic situation of the area where the donor
originates from, the hospital/ICU where the donor currently
stays, wear personal protective equipment, and practice hand
hygiene during the whole donation coordination. Further, they
should reduce unnecessary in-person contact by utilizing online
communication tools.
COVID-19 IN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS
According to a survey conducted on 88 major transplant centers
in the United States between March 24 and March 31, 2020,
31 (35.2%) respondents reported 148 COVID-19 SOT patients
altogether. Of these patients, 80 (54.1%) were mildly ill (no
pneumonia), 31 (20.9%) were moderately ill (pneumonia), and
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1392

Zhang et al. Organ Transplant During COVID-19
37 (25.0%) were critically ill (17). Although the classification
is subjective, the results indicate a greater disease severity
compared with normal COVID-19 patients. Herein, we reviewed
all reported COVID-19 SOT cases prior to April 17, 2020 to show
the manifestation, treatment, and prognosis.
COVID-19 in Kidney Transplantation
Recipients
Kidney transplantation (KT) recipients account for the largest
proportion of SOT recipients (40), which explains why they
form the majority of COVID-19 SOT patients (103/148, 69.6%)
(17). As of April 17, 2020, 27 COVID-19 KT patients have been
reported on PubMed. The mean age was 53.4 ± 16 years, and
the median post-transplantation (post-TX) interval was 4 years
[interquartile range (IQR): 1.9–9.6]. No pattern was observed
between the KT recipients’ susceptibility and post-TX interval.
It has been suggested that the atypical symptoms and absence
of fever seen in COVID-19 SOT patients might be due to
immunosuppression (41–43). Our review (Table 1) shows that
COVID-19 KT patients presented with fever (25/27, 92.6%),
cough (20/27, 74.0%), dyspnea (12/27, 44.4%), myalgia (8/27,
29.6%), fatigue (7/27, 25.9%), and sputum production (4/27,
14.8%), which is similar to COVID-19 symptoms in the general
population (37). The gastrointestinal symptoms seen in general
COVID-19 patients (58) such as anorexia (2/27, 7%), nausea
(2/27, 7%), and vomiting (2/27, 7%) are also present in COVID￾19 KT patients. It should be noted that (as shown in case No.
2) the initial symptoms are fever and vomiting, which leads to a
presumption of viral gastroenteritis. In this case, cough did not
develop until 5 days later (43).
Of the 27 COVID-19 KT patients, 7 (25.9%) required
mechanical ventilation (Table 1). Based on the severity, this
indicates that at least 25.9% of the COVID-19 KT patients were
critical (defined as COVID-19 positive along with mechanical
ventilation or evidence of multi-organ failure or shock) (59). In
comparison, the condition of about 5% of COVID-19 patients
in the general population are critical (60), which implies a worse
prognosis among infected SOT recipients. The mortality rate was
30.8% (4/13) for all known outcomes (Table 1). This is consistent
with a recent single-center study with a mortality rate of 28%
(10/36) (61).
Antiviral treatment remains controversial since sufficient
evidence is not available to prove its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2
(62, 63). The current proposed antiviral drugs with small
volume randomized controlled trials include antimalarial drugs
(chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), HIV protease inhibitors
(lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, darunavir/ritonavir),
and remdesivir (64). On May 1, 2020, US FDA (Food and
Drug Administration) issued an emergency use authorization
for remdesivir for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients
(65, 66). Of the 27 COVID-19 KT patients, 12 (44.4%)
were given hydroxychloroquine, while 10 were prescribed
lopinavir/ritonavir (Table 2). Patient No. 12 recovered with
unaltered immunosuppressive therapy and no antiviral drug.
Antiviral drugs must be handled with caution due to potential
drug–drug interactions and adverse effects. The elimination
of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and rapamycin inhibitors
(mTORi) is mainly controlled by cytochrome P450 3A4
(CYP3A4), CYP3A5, and the efflux pump P-glycoprotein
(67). However, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine
are P-glycoprotein inhibitors and lopinavir/ritonavir are
potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (68). In patient No. 15, tacrolimus
trough level reached 90.5 ng/mL with a combination of
lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and tacrolimus. The
high tacrolimus level induced renal failure in patient No.
27. Transitional discontinuation and dose reduction of CNI
are necessary before the initiation of the aforementioned
antiviral drugs.
In vitro study shows that cyclosporin A inhibits diverse
coronavirus replication including severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (69, 70). However, further
in vivo and clinical studies are needed to support the conversion
from tacrolimus to cyclosporine in COVID-19 SOT patients.
Since mTOR inhibitors can cause interstitial pneumonitis and
lead to ground glass opacity abnormality in chest CT scan
(71), switching mTOR inhibitor to CNI should be considered
among COVID-19 SOT patients with typical ground opacity
chest CT scan.
The lack of an effective treatment strategy against COVID￾19 implies that the recovery depends primarily on our immune
system itself. Regular immunosuppression in SOT patients
leads to a longer viral shedding time as observed from past
experience with RNA respiratory viral infections (42). Although
further evidence is needed, reduction of immunosuppression
might contribute to a better prognosis and a shorter course
of the disease. Of the 27 COVID-19 KT patients, 21 (77.8%)
reduced or stopped their immunosuppressive agents (Table 2).
CNI was reduced in 9/24 (37.5%) and stopped in 8/24
(33.3%) patients. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or enteric￾coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) was stopped in 14/20
(70%) patients and reduced in 1/20 (5%) patients. However,
it is riskier to reduce immunosuppression in COVID-19 SOT
cases than in SOT patients with opportunistic infections because
immunocompetent people are generally susceptible to COVID￾19 and it does not imply deficient immune status. It should
be noted that 6 of the 7 (85.7%) COVID-19 KT patients
with proteinuria were treated with reduced immunosuppression.
Certainly, proteinuria could be caused directly by COVID-19
(72, 73), but it could also be an early sign of renal rejection
(74). Further, the disappearance of proteinuria after COVID￾19 recovery in patient Nos. 1, 5, and 7 might be related to the
resumption of immunosuppression or remission from potential
COVID-19 kidney impairment.
KT recipients are deeply concerned with changes in renal
function. However, a recent postmortem renal histopathology
study in COVID-19 patients showed the direct renal impairment
caused by SARS-CoV-2, such as diffuse brush border damage
of proximal tubule, vacuolar degeneration, and necrosis (75).
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurrence in COVID-19 patients
varies drastically from 0 to 28% [0/116, 0% (76); 55/287, 19.2%
(77); 523/2,634, 19.9% (78); 55/193, 28% (72)]. This variability
may be related to the differences in therapy and treatment

availability. Proteinuria is found in 28.57–59% of COVID-19
patients and hematuria is seen in 41.17–44% of COVID-19
patients (72, 73). This impairment of the kidney may be caused
by hypoxemia, hemodynamic changes, and most importantly by
circulating inflammatory mediators (79). During our review, we
paid particular attention to kidney allograft function alteration.
Only 1 of the 27 (3.7%) COVID-19 KT patients were mentioned
with AKI. Besides proteinuria (7/9, 77.8%), no abnormal serum
creatinine change was observed between creatinine level at
admission and at discharge (or last follow-up).
Eight of the 27 (29.6%) COVID-19 KT patients were treated
with methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Altogether, 81.5%
(22/27) of the patients were prescribed with steroids including
oral steroids. Theoretically, corticosteroid administration in
COVID-19 KT patients could be beneficial in two ways:
(1) immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection and (2)
alleviation of immune-related injury to the lung (80) or
kidney (79). However, a retrospective cohort study showed
that high-dose corticosteroids had a limited beneficial effect
on SARS because it increased the risks of virus dissemination,
opportunistic infection, and osteopathy (81). In patient No. 6,
methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1,000 mg) was administrated
to treat acute rejection just 1 day before the confirmation of
COVID-19. A large dose of steroids could be an important cause
of constant fever and dyspnea during hospitalization (28 days
since the confirmation of COVID-19). Corticosteroid therapy
has been a long-lasting controversy in viral pneumonias caused
by coronaviruses. Its use in the critically ill subgroup may
help improve the outcome (80); however, further studies are
essential to establish guidelines for steroid therapy in COVID-19
SOT patients.
In short, compared with general population current reports on
COVID-19 KT patients showed similar symptoms and implied
worse outcomes. Further solid evidences are needed to prove

the efficacy of immunosuppression reduction strategy, current
antiviral treatment, and methylprednisolone pulse therapy.
Despite of involvement of kidney in COVID-19 KT patients, no
permanent renal function impairment was observed.
COVID-19 in Liver Transplant Patients
Regarding COVID-19 infection in liver transplantation, a 37-
year-old man developed fever with abdominal discomfort at day
9 (D9) after liver transplant and was subsequently confirmed
as COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR and CT examination.
The patients’ immunosuppression was discontinued and he
was administered low-dose methylprednisolone for 2 weeks.
His temperature recovered normally at D18 post-transplant;
however, he developed rejection at D27 post-transplant, which
was eventually controlled using tacrolimus and an infusion
of methylprednisolone for 3 days. His RT-PCR test for
COVID-19 was negative at D45 post-transplant and he was
discharged after achieving clinical cure standards at D51 post￾transplant (55). Another 37-year-old man presented with fever
(with a temperature of up to 39◦C) 4 days prior to liver
transplant, which persisted for 30 days even after antimicrobial
agents and caspofungin were prescribed. Thoracic CT and
RT-PCT test confirmed COVID-19 infection at D15 post￾transplant that was eventually cleared at D49 post-transplant.
However, acute cellular rejection was suspected due to low￾dose immunosuppression at D36 post-transplant and the patient
did not recover during hospitalization (82). Unfortunately, this
patient did not undergo COVID-19 associated examinations
before liver transplant; therefore, it is not known whether
COVID-19 infection occurred before or after the transplant.
A 50-year-old man who had a cadaveric liver transplant
in July 2017 contracted COVID-19 and presented with a
representative clinical course of the disease, including persistent
fever, significant lymphocytopenia, and mixed diffuse ground￾glass opacities on CT. This patient had no rejection phase and
successfully recovered after 1 month of comprehensive treatment
including immunosuppression adjustment, oxygen therapy,
antivirus, systemic low-dose methylprednisolone, intravenous
immunoglobulin, prophylactic antibiotic, alpha interferon, and
nutritional support (83).
Unfortunately, several cases with fatal outcomes have also
been reported. A 59-year old patient who had undergone a liver
transplant 3 years earlier was infected by his wife on February
1, 2020. His symptoms progressed rapidly from mild to critical
illness with several nosocomial infections, and although several
standard rescue efforts were attempted, he eventually died 45
days after the diagnosis. The authors believe that an earlier
withdrawal of immunosuppression along with a more aggressive
approach that includes antiviral and antibacterial therapy might
have averted the fatal outcome (84). A transplant center from
Italy reported that three long-term (more than 10 years) liver
transplant survivors died between 3 and 12 days after the onset
of COVID-19 pneumonia. All three patients were men and older
than 65 years with diabetes. The authors declare that long￾term liver transplant patients with metabolic comorbidities are
associated with a poor prognosis (85).
Similar with the difficulty we face in COVID-19 KT patients,
aforementioned COVID-19 liver transplant cases show that
it is tricky to regulate immune system and balance between
infection and rejection. The liver tissue damage might be due
to an immune-mediated inflammatory response to the virus or a
direct virus-induced cytopathogenic effect that has been reviewed
elsewhere (86).
COVID-19 in Heart and Lung Transplant
Patients
Compared with the COVID-19 infection in kidney and liver
transplant patients, there are fewer reported cases for heart
transplant patients. The first two cases of COVID-19 infected
heart transplant recipients from China were cured after
treatments that were similar to those in non-transplant recipients
(87). Two of the three heart transplant recipients reported from
Spain were discharged after 20 days of treatment, which included
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy and discontinuation of
immunosuppression; however, the third one died at day 10 after
confirmed COVID-19 infection although lopinavir/ritonavir,
HCQ, and interferon–β (IFN-β) were administered (57).
Lung transplantation is the only effective treatment modality
for end-stage pulmonary chronic diseases (88). A 59-year￾old woman 13 months post-bilateral lung transplant was
reported with confirmed COVID-19. Only mild exercise dyspnea
and dry cough were present without any fever or diarrhea.
Without any administration of antiviral drugs or change of
immunosuppression therapy or mechanical ventilation, the viral
load decreased overtime and turned negative after 21 days
hospitalization (89). Currently, no guidelines are available to treat
lung transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Lung transplant as a treatment of acute infectious pneumonia
was relatively rare (90). During this COVID-19 pandemic, three
chronic pulmonary disease patients infected with COVID-19
(for more than a month) received lung transplants after full
ethical approval. Two of them survived during the short-term
follow-up; however, the third patient died post-transplant (91).
Soon afterwards, the first description of lung transplantation for
COVID-19 confirmed elderly patients with end-stage pulmonary
disease was reported by Han et al. (90). It is recommended
that the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 should be negative at least
twice (24-h interval) for transplant candidates; else, the virus
may damage the transplanted lung and medical staff will be at
a high risk of transmission. These five reported cases suggest
that lung transplant is a potential option for patients when
internal medicine treatments including mechanical ventilation
and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannot
enhance lung function.
CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 pandemic will continue to threaten global
public health and transplantation programs until effective
antiviral drugs and vaccines are developed. In order to ensure
transplantation safety, donor and recipient screening is necessary
in COVID-19 spreading areas. The SOT recipients are an

immunologically vulnerable group and it is crucial to prevent
viral infection in such patients. Both online education to
spread awareness about COVID-19 and online follow-up could
minimize the risk of infection in SOT patients. Compared
with the general population, our review of current COVID￾19 KT cases show a similar clinical manifestation and inferior
outcomes. The long-lasting controversy over immunoregulation
to balance infection and rejection continues during this battle
with COVID-19. Antiviral drugs and methylprednisolone pulse
therapy should be administered with great caution. Current
antiviral therapy needs more evidence to prove that its efficacy
can outweigh its potential adverse effects and drug-drug
interactions. Lung transplant could be a possible way out for
end stage COVID-19 patients, but great caution should be
taken before COVID-19 lung injury is proven irreversible.
Generally, much more studies and specific clinical guidelines
are needed to protect transplantation from the adverse effect
of COVID-19.
