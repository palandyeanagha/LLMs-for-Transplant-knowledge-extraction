ABSTRACT
Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal disorder characterized by
fibroproliferation and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung.
Methods and Findings
Using oligonucleotide arrays, we identified osteopontin as one of the genes that significantly
distinguishes IPF from normal lungs. Osteopontin was localized to alveolar epithelial cells in IPF
lungs and was also significantly elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage from IPF patients. To study
the fibrosis-relevant effects of osteopontin we stimulated primary human lung fibroblasts and
alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with recombinant osteopontin. Osteopontin induced a
significant increase of migration and proliferation in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells.
Epithelial growth was inhibited by the pentapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) and
antibody to CD44, while fibroproliferation was inhibited by GRGDS and antibody to avb3
integrin. Fibroblast and epithelial cell migration were inhibited by GRGDS, anti-CD44, and anti￾avb3. In fibroblasts, osteopontin up-regulated tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 and type I
collagen, and down-regulated matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) expression, while in A549 cells
it caused up-regulation of MMP-7. In human IPF lungs, osteopontin colocalized with MMP-7 in
alveolar epithelial cells, and application of weakest link statistical models to microarray data
suggested a significant interaction between osteopontin and MMP-7.
Conclusions
Our results provide a potential mechanism by which osteopontin secreted from the alveolar
epithelium may exert a profibrotic effect in IPF lungs and highlight osteopontin as a potential
target for therapeutic intervention in this incurable disease.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrosing
interstitial pneumonia of unknown etiology characterized by
alveolar epithelial cell injury/activation, fibroblast prolifer￾ation, and exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix
in the lung parenchyma [1,2]. The disease is usually
progressive and largely unresponsive to corticosteroid and
immunosuppressive therapy [2,3].
A distinctive morphological feature of IPF is the develop￾ment of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic foci, represented by
widely scattered, small aggregates of subepithelial mesenchy￾mal cells immersed within a myxoid-appearing extracellular
matrix [4]. These fibroblastic/myofibroblastic foci represent
areas of active fibrogenesis and play a crucial role in the
progressive fibrotic response [1,5]. These sites are charac￾terized by inappropriate re-epithelialization and impaired
extracellular matrix remodeling. Although significant advan￾ces have been made in the characterization of the clinical and
morphological features of this disease, the molecular mech￾anisms that underlie IPF pathogenesis in humans are still
largely unknown [1,4–7].
Osteopontin (also termed secreted phosphoprotein 1) is a
phosphorylated acidic glycoprotein that contains an Arg-Gly￾Asp motif that binds to the integrin family of adhesion
molecules [8]. It functions as a cell adhesion and migration
molecule that can bind to several ligands, including avb3
integrin, some CD44 isoforms, and fibronectin [9,10].
Osteopontin has been implicated in a number of physio￾logical and pathological processes including bone resorption,
malignant transformation, and metastasis [11,12]. It is also
considered a key cytokine regulating inflammation, cellular
immune response, and tissue repair, with a unique effect on T
cell function [11,12].
Using oligonucleotide microarrays we previously demon￾strated that osteopontin is highly up-regulated in bleomycin￾induced lung fibrosis in mice, and we reported similar results in
a preliminary report involving five IPF lungs and four control
samples [13,14]. Interestingly, osteopontin seems to have a
profibrotic effect in the development of bleomycin-induced
pulmonary fibrosis [15]. After bleomycin instillation, osteopon￾tin-null mice developed reduced lung fibrosis characterized by
dilated distal air spaces with decreased active transforming
growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1) and reduced type I collagen
expression compared with wild-type controls [16]. The
mechanisms by which osteopontin, a cytokine with primarily
TH1 effects (i.e., antifibrotic) on T lymphocytes [11,17,18], may
cause profibrotic effects are not fully understood.
In this study, we applied microarrays to analyze gene
expression patterns in a larger cohort of IPF lungs (13 IPF
samples and 11 controls), and we analyzed the direct effects of
osteopontin on human lung fibroblasts, alveolar epithelial
cell migration and proliferation, and matrix metalloprotease
(MMP) gene expression in vitro.
Methods
Study Population
Patients from the National Institute of Respiratory
Diseases, Mexico City, Me´ xico (Protocol S1), and the
University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United
States (Protocol S2), were included in this study. The protocol
was approved by both Institutions, and written informed
consent was obtained where required. Samples for oligonu￾cleotide microarray were obtained from the tissue bank of
the Department of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh.
The use of archived tissue has been approved by the local
Institutional review board. Diagnosis of IPF was supported by
history, physical examination, pulmonary function studies,
chest HRCT, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings, and
was corroborated by open lung biopsy. The morphologic
diagnosis of IPF was based on typical microscopic findings
consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia [4]. The patients
fulfilled the criteria of the American Thoracic Society and
European Respiratory Society [7]. BAL samples were obtained
at first consult as part of the initial diagnostic work-up. None
of the patients had been treated with corticosteroids or
immunosuppressive drugs at the time of BAL. Demographic
data, pulmonary function data, and BAL differential cell
counts are provide in Table 1.
Levels of osteopontin in BAL fluids were evaluated in ten
healthy individuals (two current smokers, two former
smokers, and six that had never smoked). All had normal
chest X-rays and spirometries. Likewise, histologically normal
lung tissues obtained at necropsy from six nonsmoking adult
individuals who had died of causes unrelated to lung diseases
were utilized for immunohistochemistry. For oligonucleotide
microarrays, control samples included normal histology lung
samples resected from patients with lung cancer obtained
from the Pittsburgh Tissue Bank (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
United States).
Oligonucleotide Microarrays
Surgical remnants of biopsies or lungs explanted from
patients with IPF that underwent pulmonary transplant were
the sources of 13 IPF samples. Lung samples resected from
patients with lung cancer, obtained from the tissue bank of
the Department of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh,
were the sources of 11 normal samples. None of these samples
had been included in our previous study. Total RNA was
extracted and used as a template to generate double-stranded
cDNA and biotin-labeled cRNA, as recommended by the
manufacturer of the arrays and previously described [11].
Fragmented cRNA was hybridized to Codelink Uniset I slides.

Osteopontin in IPF

After hybridization, arrays were washed and stained with
streptavidin-AlexaFluor 647. The arrays were scanned using a
Genepix 4000B microarray scanner. Images were analyzed
using Codelink expression II analysis suite. They were visually
inspected for defects and quality control parameters as
recommended by the manufacturer. Data files were imported
into a microarray database and linked with updated gene
annotations using SOURCE (http://genome-www5.stanford.e￾du/cgi-bin/SMD/source/sourceSearch) and then median scaled.
Based on our previous experience, all expression levels below
0.01 were brought to 0.01. Statistical analysis was performed
using Scoregene gene expression package (http://www.cs.hu￾ji.ac.il/labs/compbio/scoregenes), and data visualization was
performed using Genexpress (http://genexpress.stanford.edu)
and Spotfire Decision Site 8.0 (Spotfire, Go¨teborg, Sweden).
The complete set of gene array data has been deposited in the
Gene Expression Omnibus database with GEO serial accession
number GSE2052 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) according
to MIAME guidelines. The general approach to analysis was
previously described by us [19]. Weakest link models [20,21]
were fitted using the Weaklink package for the R statistical
software system (http://www.r-project.org). The p-value was
obtained from fitting a logistic regression model with a single
independent variable that is the minimum of the percentiles
for the expression levels for the two genes. A Bonferroni
correction was applied for multiple testing.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage
BAL was performed through flexible fiberoptic broncho￾scopy under local anesthesia. Briefly, 300 ml of normal saline
was instilled in 50-ml aliquots, with an average recovery of
60%–70%. The recovered BAL fluid was centrifuged at 250 g
for 10 min at 4 8C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of
PBS and an aliquot was used to evaluate the total number of
cells. Other aliquots were fixed in carbowax, stained with
hematoxylin and eosin, and used for differential cell count.
Supernatants were kept at 70 8C until use.
ELISA
Quantification of osteopontin was performed in BAL fluid
samples from 18 IPF patients and 10 healthy individual
controls, by using a commercial sensitive and specific ELISA
following the instructions of the manufacturer (Calbiochem,
La Jolla, California, United States).
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then
blocked with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, then antigen
was retrieved with citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) for 5 min in
a microwave. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human osteo￾pontin (2 ng/ml; Calbiochem) was applied and samples were
incubated at 4 8C overnight. A secondary biotinylated anti￾immunoglobulin followed by horseradish peroxidase-conju￾gated streptavidin (BioGenex, San Ramon, California, United
States) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions.
AEC (BioGenex) in acetate buffer containing 0.05% H2O2 was
used as substrate [15,19]. The sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin. The primary antibody was replaced by
non-immune serum for negative control slides.
Two-Color Immunofluorescence Analysis
A standard two-stage double-immunofluorescence labeling
technique was used. Briefly, frozen sections were washed in
PBS (0.01 M [pH 7.4]) for 5 min and then fixed in cold acetone
for 10 min, twice. Tissues were incubated in blocking buffer
(1% BSA, 5% normal serum, 0.05% NP-40, in PBS) for 30
min. The slides were then incubated with a rabbit antibody to
osteopontin (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
United States) for 1 h at room temperature and washed in
PBST (0.05% Tween-20 in 0.01 M PBS [pH 7.4]) for 10 min,
three times. A mouse anti-MMP-7 monoclonal antibody
(1:1,000; Chemicon International, Temecula, California,
United States) was added and the slides were incubated for
an additional 1 h at room temperature. After three 10-min
washes in PBST, slides were incubated with secondary
antibodies (sheep anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3, 1:1,000; and goat
anti-mouse IgG-FITC, 1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
Missouri, United States) for 30 min. Slides were then washed
in the same buffer and mounted with antifade medium
(containing DAPI to stain cell nuclei).
Cell Culture
Primary human normal lung fibroblasts were obtained as
previously described [22], and the A549 cell line was obtained
from ATCC (Rockville, Maryland, United States).
Growth Rate Assay
Lung fibroblasts or A549 cells were seeded in 96-well
culture plates at a cell density of 7.5 3 103 and 5 3 103 cells/
well respectively, and incubated in Ham’s F-12 and DMEM
media, respectively (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, New York,
United States), supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 8C in 5%
CO2 and 95% air. After 12 h, the medium was replaced by
medium with 0.1% FBS alone or 0.1% FBS plus increasing
concentrations of osteopontin (0.4, 1, and 2 lg/ml) and the
cells were maintained in culture for another 48 h. Cell growth
was determined using the cell proliferation reagent WST-1
(Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) as previously
described [19]. All assays were performed in triplicate. In
parallel experiments, fibroblasts and A549 cells were pre￾treated for 25 min with antibody to human avb3 integrin (10
lg/ml; Chemicon), the pentapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser
(GRGDS; Calbiochem), or antibody to human CD44 (Neo￾Markers, Fremont, California, United States), and then
osteopontin was added (2 lg/ml). Additionally, A549 cells
were pretreated with antibody to human epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR; 10 lg/ml; Chemicon).
Cell Migration Assay
Migration of fibroblasts and A549 cells was assayed using
commercially available 24-well collagen-coated Boyden cham￾bers (Chemicon) with an 8-lm pore size. Briefly, a semi
confluent (;80%) monolayer of lung fibroblasts or A549 cells
was harvested with trypsin-EDTA, centrifuged, and resus￾pended in Ham’s F-12 medium containing 5% BSA. The cell
suspensions (3 3 105 cells/well) were added to the upper
chamber. The lower chamber contained 0.3 ml of medium
with 5% BSA alone or with 10 lg/ml of recombinant human
osteopontin (Calbiochem). PDGF (8 ng/ml) and epidermal
growth factor (EGF; 50 ng/ml) were used as positive controls
for fibroblasts and for A549 cells, respectively. Additional
BSA-coated chambers were used as blanks for each sample.
After incubation for 8 h at 37 8C in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2 and 95% air, the nonmigrating cells on the top
of Boyden chamber were scraped and washed. The migrating

cells were quantitated according to manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Briefly, the cells were stained and the color eluted with
300 ll of extraction buffer, and 150-ll aliquots were
measured in an ELISA plate reader at 545 nm. All assays
were performed in duplicate. In parallel experiments, A549
cells and fibroblasts were pretreated as described above for
growth rate.
RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis
Total RNA was extracted from lung fibroblasts and A549
epithelial cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH,
Germany). Cells were lysed and homogenized in the presence
of a highly denaturing guanidine isothiocyanate-containing
buffer. The samples were then applied to an RNeasy
minicolumn, and RNA was eluted in 30 ll of water. Total
RNA (20 lg/lane) was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel
containing 0.66 M formaldehyde [21]. Ribosomal RNA was
visualized with ethidium bromide, and the fractionated RNA
was transferred onto a Nytran transfer membrane (NEN Life
Science Products, Boston, Massachusetts, United States) by
capillary blotting overnight. RNA was immobilized by baking
at 80 8C for 2 h, and then prehybridized at 42 8C for 18 h in 53
SSC, 50% formamide, 53 Denhardt’s solution, and 0.5% SDS,
containing 100 lg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA.
Hybridization was carried out at 42 8C for 18 h in hybrid￾ization buffer composed of formamide, 0.5% SDS, and heat￾denatured 32P-labeled cDNA probes. After washing, mem￾branes were dried and exposed to Kodak BIOMAX MS film at
70 8C with an intensifying screen. The cDNA clones for
human MMP-1, TIMP-1, a1 type I collagen, and RNA
ribosomal 18S were obtained from ATCC. Human MMP-7
cDNA was a kind gift of Lynn Matrisian, Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States. The cDNA
probes were radiolabeled with 32P-dCTP to a specific activity
of 200 3 106 dpm/lg using a Random Primer Labeling Kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States). All experi￾ments were repeated twice.
Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR
1 lg of RNA was treated with 1 unit of DNAase (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, New York, United States). First￾strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with
random primers and Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase according to manufacturer’s protocol (Advant￾age RT-for-PCR Kit; Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United
States).
Real-time PCR amplification was performed using i-Cycler
iQ Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, California, United
States), using TAQMAN probes (PE Applied Biosystems,
Wellesley, California, United States) labeled with FAM and
TET. PCR was performed with the cDNA working mixture in
a 25-ll reaction volume containing 3 ll of cDNA, 20 mM Tris￾HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 200 lM dNTPs, 0.2 lM
specific 59 and 39 primers for 18S rRNA, 0.6 lM specific 59
and 39 primers for gene target, 0.2 lM of each probe
TAQMAN (18S rRNA and gene target), and 1.25 units of
AmpliTaq GOLD DNA polymerase (PE Applied Biosystems).
A dynamical range was built with each product of PCR on
copy number serial dilutions from 1 3 108 to 1 3 101
; all PCRs
were performed in triplicate. Standard curves were calculated
referring the threshold cycle (Ct) to the log of each cDNA
dilution step. Results were expressed as the number of copies
of the target gene normalized to 18S rRNA. Some primers
used in PCR reactions were designed using Beacon Designer
software 2.1 (BioRad) and checked for homology in BLAST.
The cycling conditions for PCR amplification were per￾formed using the following protocol: Initial activation of
AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase at 95 8C for 7 min; and 40
cycles of denaturation at 95 8C for 30s, annealing at 60 8C for
30 s, and extension at 72 8C for 30 s. The sequences of the
PCR primer pairs and probes for each gene are shown in
Table 2. All PCR experiments were done in duplicate.
PAGE Zymography
For MMP-7 analysis, conditioned media was electropho￾resed in 12.5% SDS gels containing as substrate bovine CM￾transferrin (0.3 mg/ml) and heparin [22]. After electropho￾resis, gels were washed in a solution of 2.5% Triton X-100,
and incubated overnight at 37 8C in 100 mM glycine (pH 7.6),
plus 10 mM CaCl2 and 50 nM ZnCl2. Identical gels were
incubated but in the presence of 20 mM EDTA. Gels were
stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and destained in a
solution of 7.5% acetic acid and 5% methanol. Recombinant
human MMP-7 (Chemicon) was used as positive control.
Western Blot Analysis
Serum-free conditioned media was centrifuged at 300 g at 4
8C for 30 min to remove cell debris, then concentrated by
lyophilization. Samples were solubilized in water, and
aliquots containing 5 lg of protein were mixed with Laemmli
sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% or 12.5% SDS￾polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitro￾cellulose filters at 15 V for 20 min using semi-dry transfer
cell (BioRad). Nonspecific sites were blocked overnight with
4% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS, and membranes were
incubated with rabbit antibody to human interstitial collage￾nase IgG (1:250 in PBS with 1% BSA; Santa Cruz Biotechnol￾ogy, California, United States), antibody to human TIMP-1
(Chemicon), antibody to human MMP-7 (Oncogene, San
Diego, California, United States), or monoclonal antibody to

conjugated to peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature.
Finally, the filters were developed with the Enhanced
Chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States) using radio￾graph film (Hyperfilm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) ac￾cording to the instructions of the manufacturer. Western
blots were repeated twice.
Results
Osteopontin Gene Expression Is Highly Up-Regulated in
IPF Lungs
The complete microarray dataset is available at the Gene
Expression Omnibus database with GEO serial accession
number GSE2052 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). Gene
expression patterns clearly distinguished IPF lungs from
normal lungs. Osteopontin was the most up-regulated gene
among the genes that distinguished IPF lungs (Figure 1A).
Osteopontin levels were increased more than 20-fold (mean
expression 0.62 in control lungs, 16.8 in IPF lungs; Figure 1B).
This increase was statistically significant whether we applied
threshold number of misclassifications (TNoM) score (p ¼
0.000221), or Student’s t-test (p ¼ 0.0000035). We corrected
for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate at
the 5% level [23]. Osteopontin expression levels were higher
in most IPF lungs than in any control lung (Figure 1B).
Osteopontin Is Increased in BAL Fluid from IPF Patients
Osteopontin protein was quantified in BAL fluids from 18
IPF patients and 10 healthy controls. As shown in Figure 2,
ELISA measurement revealed a significant increase in the
immunoreactive protein in the fluids derived from IPF lungs
(148.8 6 83 ng/ml in IPF lungs versus 3.8 6 2.0 ng/ml in
healthy controls, p , 0.01).
Immunoreactive Osteopontin Is Localized Primarily in
Epithelial Cells
To examine the cellular source of osteopontin we analyzed
IPF and control lungs by immunohistochemistry. As illus￾trated in Figure 3A–3C, osteopontin was localized primarily
in alveolar epithelial cells that exhibited an intense cytoplas￾mic staining in IPF lungs. Occasionally, clusters of alveolar
macrophages were also positive (Figure 3C). Immunohisto￾chemical staining for osteopontin was negative in normal
lungs as well as in lung tissue samples incubated with
nonimmune sera (Figure 3D).
Osteopontin Induces Fibroblast and Epithelial Cell Growth
Rate
To determine the effect of osteopontin on the growth rates
of fibroblasts and epithelial cells, cells were stimulated with
increasing concentrations of osteopontin, and the cell
number was determined after 48 h using the cell proliferation
reagent WST-1. Significant dose-dependent increases in cell

proliferation were observed with 1 lg/ml and 2 lg/ml. Two
different fibroblast lines reached 220% and 380% over
controls (p , 0.01), while in two different experiments A549
cell lines exhibited 60% and 80% increases of growth rate
over control (p , 0.01).
Osteopontin-induced fibroblast proliferation (2 lg/ml) was
significantly suppressed by GRGDS-pentapeptide, which
interrupts binding of RGD-containing proteins to cell surface
integrins (p , 0.01) and by antibody to avb3 integrin (p ,
0.05), suggesting that the effect of osteopontin on growth rate
was mediated by the interaction of the GRGDS domain of
osteopontin with avb3 integrin (Figure 4A). In contrast,
epithelial cell growth was partially inhibited by antibody to
CD44 (p , 0.05) (Figure 4B). Epithelial cell growth was also
significantly suppressed by GRGDS but not by antibodies to
avb3 (Figure 4B).

To examine the effect of osteopontin on cell migration, we
used collagen-coated Boyden chambers, a well-established in
vitro assay system. The number of cells that migrated in
absence of osteopontin was used as control (0% migration). As
revealed in Figure 5A, fibroblasts significantly moved toward
osteopontin compared with cells exposed to medium plus 5%
BSA alone in the lower chamber. Osteopontin (10 lg)

Osteopontin in IPF

enhanced fibroblast migration by 120% 6 11% (p , 0.01), an
enhancement similar to that obtained with the potent
fibroblast mitogen platelet-derived growth factor, used as a
positive control (157% 6 12%, unpublished data). To analyze
possible mechanisms by which osteopontin stimulates migra￾tion, different blockers were used. Fibroblast migration was
significantly reduced by GRGDS and antibody to avb3 integrin
(p , 0.01), and by antibody to CD44 (p , 0.05). The inhibition
of cell migration was specific, since incubation with IgG had
no effect (unpublished data).
A549 lung cells also showed a significant increase in cell
migration in response to osteopontin (Figure 5B). After 8 h of
incubation, A549 cells passing through the membrane
increased by 114% 6 25% compared to control cells (p ,
0.01). Epidermal growth factor, used as a positive control,
induced a 168% 6 14% increase in cell migration (unpub￾lished data). Osteopontin-induced migration was abolished
when the epithelial cells were pretreated individually with
GRGDS, anti-avb3 integrin, or anti-CD44 (p , 0.01; Figure 5B).
Osteopontin Induces an Environment That Favors
Extracellular Matrix Deposition in Fibroblasts
MMP-1 expression by fibroblasts. Under basal conditions,
some primary human lung fibroblast cell lines may express
MMP-1, while others express the enzyme only when stimu￾lated, for example, by aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA).
In this context, the effect of osteopontin on MMP-1
expression was examined by Northern blot analysis in a cell
line producing MMP-1 under basal conditions, and in a cell
line that did not produce MMP-1 but was stimulated by
APMA (Figure 6A and 6B). Osteopontin down-regulated both
the basal and the APMA-induced MMP-1 transcript level.
When the signal of MMP-1 mRNA was normalized to the level
of 18S RNA and quantified by densitometry, a reduction of
;50% was noticed. This result was confirmed by real-time
PCR that showed ;40% inhibition (p , 0.05; Figure 6C).
Inhibition of MMP-1 expression was partially blocked by
antibody to CD44, while it was not affected by antibody to
avb3 integrin. The inhibitory effect of osteopontin on MMP-1
was also observed at the protein level by Western blot
analysis. As shown in Figure 6D, the level of immunoreactive
MMP-1 present in the conditioned medium was decreased in
the fibroblasts stimulated with osteopontin as compared with
control cells.
Osteopontin increases TIMP-1 expression by fibroblasts.
The effect of osteopontin on TIMP-1 gene expression in
fibroblasts is illustrated in Figure 7. Northern blot analysis
(Figure 7A) revealed an increase in TIMP-1 gene expression at
0.4 lg/ml and 1 lg/ml osteopontin when compared to control.
This result was confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 7B).
Osteopontin increased the TIMP-1/18S ribosomal RNA from
55.7 6 14.2 copies to 121.2 6 13.1 copies (p , 0.01). Both
anti-CD44 and anti-avb3 integrin abolished this increase.
Osteopontin also increased TIMP-1 protein expression in
conditioned medium as illustrated in Figure 7C.
Osteopontin induces collagen gene expression in fibro￾blasts. The effect of osteopontin on collagen gene expression
is depicted in Figure 8. Northern blot analysis (Figure 8A)
revealed a 2-fold increase in a1 type I collagen gene expression.

Osteopontin in IPF

Expression of a-smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts was
induced by TGF-b1 but not by osteopontin (Figure 8B).
Osteopontin Increases MMP-7 Expression by Epithelial
Cells
Stimulation of A549 cells with osteopontin (0.4 lg/ml and
2.0 lg/ml) induced an up-regulation of MMP-7 gene expres￾sion as illustrated by Northern blot in Figure 9A. Real-time
PCR revealed a 6-fold increase at 6 h after osteopontin
stimulation, which was abolished by treatment with anti-avb3,
anti-CD44, anti-EGFR, or GRGDS as shown in Figure 9B. Pro￾MMP-7 overexpression was confirmed at the protein level by
Western blot analysis of the epithelial cells conditioned
medium (Figure 9C). As recombinant MMP-7 used as control
showed a lower molecular weight band to that of conditioned
medium, this one was treated with APMA to activate pro￾MMP-7. Activated proenzyme showed a similar molecular
weight band to the recombinant protein. Zymography using
CM-transferrin as substrate showed that treatment of A549
epithelial cells with 0.4 lg/ml and 1 lg/ml osteopontin
induced an increase of both the pro-MMP-7 and MMP-7
activity bands (Figure 9D).
Osteopontin Colocalizes with MMP-7 in Alveolar Epithelial
Cells from IPF Lungs
Since we have previously demonstrated that IPF lungs
strongly express MMP-7 in alveolar epithelial cells [14], we
evaluated whether the staining pattern of this enzyme is
associated with that of osteopontin. Figure 10 illustrates
confocal microscopy images showing that MMP-7 (Figure
10A) is partially overlapped with that of osteopontin (Figure
10B), giving substantial double labeling (Figure 10C and 10D).
Normal lungs did not exhibit any significant staining for
MMP-7 or osteopontin (unpublished data).
Weakest Link Models Identify a Statistically Significant
Interaction between Osteopontin and MMP-7
To determine whether MMP-7 and osteopontin expression
levels jointly distinguish IPF and control samples, we applied
weakest link statistical models [20]. Weakest link models
assume that two genes jointly impact the probability that a
randomly selected sample belongs to a certain phenotype
(IPF in this case) only if expression levels of the two genes lie
on a low-dimensional curve whose form is specified by the
model and estimated using the observed quantiles of the data.

Osteopontin in IPF

Our analysis detected a statistically significant joint effect of
MMP-7 and osteopontin on the IPF phenotype (p , 0.001).
This joint relationship is illustrated in Figure 11 for both the
gene expression values (Figure 11A) and the sample percen￾tiles (Figure 11B). To assess the relevance of this association,
we chose both substantively meaningful genes and a more
general set of genes to evaluate the contribution of the
weakest link model relating osteopontin and MMP-7 (Figure
11). Among 14 matrix metalloproteases and their inhibitors
represented on the Human Uniset I chip, osteopontin and
MMP-7 exhibited the most significant biological interaction.
Osteopontin also had significant interactions (weakest link
models with p , 0.05) with MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-11 but
none was as statistically significant as MMP-7. We also ran
weakest link models combining osteopontin with each of 400
genes that passed the false discovery rate of less than 0.05 for
differential expression between IPF and control samples. The
interaction of osteopontin with MMP-7 in a weakest link model
was more significant than 371 of these 400 genes.
Discussion
In the present study we focused on the profibrotic effects
of osteopontin, a multifunctional cytokine that mediates
diverse biological functions, including cell adhesion, chemo￾taxis, and signaling, as well as tissue reparative processes
[8,11,12]. We demonstrated that osteopontin was the most up￾regulated gene in lungs of IPF patients, and that it was mainly
expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. To better understand
the potential local profibrotic effects of osteopontin, we
studied its effects on lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells.
Functionally, osteopontin induced fibroblast and epithelial
cell proliferation and migration. The effect on fibroblast
migration and proliferation was dependent mainly on
integrins, while in epithelial cells proliferation was mainly
dependent on CD44 and migration was dependent on CD44
and integrin signaling. Osteopontin exhibited profibrotic
effects on molecules involved in extracellular matrix remod￾eling. Thus, in fibroblasts, osteopontin increased TIMP-1 and
type I collagen and inhibited MMP-1 expression, while in
alveolar epithelial cells it induced MMP-7. The effects on
TIMP-1 and MMP-1 expression appeared to be mostly
dependent on CD44, while the effect on MMP-7 expression
was dependent on CD44 and integrin signaling. Interestingly,
osteopontin was colocalized with MMP-7 in alveolar epithelial
cells of IPF lungs, and application of the weakest link models
to microarray data suggested that the genes of both
interacted to affect the IPF phenotype. Our results provide
a potential mechanism by which osteopontin secreted from
epithelial cells exerts its profibrotic effects through direct
signaling on fibroblasts and epithelial cells.
Several studies in experimental tissue fibrosis have sug￾gested a possible profibrotic role of osteopontin. In kidney
fibrosis, osteopontin enhances macrophage recruitment and
stimulates the development of renal scarring after an acute
ischemic insult [24]. Also, osteopontin expression is increased
in the myocardium after myocardial infarction, and the lack
of this mediator is associated with decreased collagen
accumulation [25]. Similarly, osteopontin appears to be an
important mediator of the cardiac profibrotic effects of

Osteopontin in IPF

angiotensin II by promoting collagen synthesis and remodel￾ing in the interstitial myocardium [26]. In experimental lung
fibrosis it has been suggested that osteopontin produced by
alveolar macrophages functions as a fibrogenic cytokine
[15,16]. In granulomatous lung diseases, osteopontin is also
up-regulated and its main sources are macrophages and T
lymphocytes [27,28]. We observed that in human IPF lungs,
hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells seemed to be a source of
osteopontin, which is consistent with the findings of Berman
et al. [15,16]. These observations support the key role of
alveolar epithelial cells as regulators of the lung profibrotic
microenvironment in IPF, thus emphasizing the critical
difference between the mechanisms of fibrosis in IPF
compared with animal models or with lung fibrosis associated
with inflammatory disorders.
Positive feedback mechanisms have been previously pro￾posed for osteopontin and MMP-2 [29], where osteopontin
induces MMP-2 expression [30] and is cleaved and activated
by MMP-2 [29]. The same mechanism has been proposed for
osteopontin and MMP-3, where osteopontin binds and
activates MMP-3, which in turn can cleave and activate it
[31]. Similarly, osteopontin is cleaved and activated by MMP-7

Osteopontin in IPF

[31], and we observe that MMP-7 is induced by osteopontin in
epithelial cells, suggesting that this positive feedback mech￾anism is also applicable to osteopontin and MMP-7. This is
also supported by the colocalization of MMP-7 and osteo￾pontin in IPF epithelial cells, and by the computational
relationship of the expression levels of osteopontin and
MMP-7. Interestingly, MMP-7 and osteopontin are b-catenin
target genes [32,33]. Recently, Chilosi et al. reported
impressive activation of WNT/b-catenin in IPF lungs [34].
They have mainly observed b-catenin nuclear localization in
proliferative bronchiolar lesions, where it colocalized with
MMP-7 [34]. Collectively, these results could indicate a
mechanism by which osteopontin and MMP-7 are induced
by aberrant activation of the WNT/b-catenin pathway, and
each affects the function and expression of the other gene,
thus representing a local positive feedback mechanism that
facilitates a chronic, relentless lung disease.
Although intriguing, this proposed positive, self-perpetu￾ating loop in itself cannot explain increased collagen
deposition, the critical hallmark of fibrosis. In this context,
our results suggest that osteopontin affects the critical
balance between MMPs and their inhibitors through its cell￾specific effects. In agreement with the inhibition of inter￾leukin 1b-stimulated increases in MMP-2 and MMP-9 ob￾served by Xie et al. [35], we observed that in human lung
fibroblasts, osteopontin caused a significant reduction of
baseline as well as APMA-stimulated MMP-1, an MMP
responsible for fibrillar collagen degradation. Additionally,
we observed a concomitant increase in TIMP-1, the main
inhibitor of MMP-1 (as well as MMP-2 and 9), and in type I
collagen gene expression, suggesting that osteopontin may
facilitate a profibrotic environment not only by its effect on
epithelial cells but also by inducing a nondegradative
microenvironment similar to the one observed in IPF and
experimental lung fibrosis [36,37]. Interestingly, osteopontin
did not induce a-smooth muscle actin in lung fibroblasts in
vitro, suggesting that although it had a role in facilitating the
profibrotic environment in IPF, it had weaker role in the
formation of myofibroblast foci. However, further experi￾ments will be needed to determine this point.
Migration and proliferation of fibroblasts are essential for
the expansion of their populations and the formation of the
fibroblastic foci that seem to represent the ‘‘leading edge’’ of
the progressive fibrotic process [5]. The observation that
osteopontin induced both migration and proliferation of
primary human lung fibroblasts suggests that osteopontin
may be involved in this process and is supported by previous
observations in murine and human fibroblast cell lines [15].
Osteopontin promotes fibroblast collagen gel contraction
and rat cardiac fibroblast proliferation, and it has been
suggested that it is an important mediator of angiotensin II
regulation of fibroblast behavior in the cardiac remodeling
process [38]. It also induced proliferation of vessel smooth
muscle cells, suggesting that it is involved in vascular
remodeling during the development of atherosclerosis
[39,40]. These results highlight the sufficiency of a cytokine
secreted from alveolar epithelial cell to induce many of the
phenotypic changes associated with lung fibrosis.
The mechanisms by which osteopontin influences epithe￾lial and fibroblast cells are not fully understood. In general it
has been proposed that osteopontin affects cells by binding to
CD44 isoforms, certain integrins, and EGFR [41,42]. It is
unknown whether the expression of these receptors is
changed in IPF; CD44 is expressed on lung fibroblasts and
epithelial cells [43], is induced in radiation- and bleomycin￾induced pulmonary fibrosis [44] and in acute alveolar fibrosis
[45], and is critical for resolution of noninfectious lung
inflammation [46]. The integrin receptors for osteopontin are
widely expressed in lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts [47],
but a change in their repertoire has not been reported yet
with IPF. In this paper we did not seek to fully dissect these
mechanisms; however, we explored some of the possible
receptors that may be important to osteopontin effect on
fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Our results support some of
the previous observations regarding the importance of
integrin-mediated signaling in fibroblast migration. Interest￾ingly, we observed a differential effect in epithelial and
fibroblasts cells. Inhibition of CD44 significantly reduced the
effects of osteopontin on cell proliferation in epithelial cells,
while avb3 inhibition seemed to affect mostly fibroblasts. This
integrin is a receptor for a wide variety of extracellular
matrix ligands with an exposed RGD sequence, including
vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, thrombospondin, pro￾teolyzed collagen, von Willebrand factor, as well as osteo￾pontin, and appears to play a critical role in cell migration
[48]. The hyaluronic acid receptor CD44 is also a receptor for
osteopontin, and it has been implicated in chemotaxis
mediated by this mediator [10,49,50]. In our experiments,
the pan-integrin antagonist GRGDS-pentapeptide added to
the culture medium abolished the effects in fibroblasts and
epithelial cells, suggesting that different integrins may be
involved in both cell types, and that for some effects, both
integrins and CD44 are required. Detailed studies of the
effects of variant osteopontin isoforms as well as cells that
express different receptors will be needed to elucidate these
mechanisms.
Our study focused on human tissues and human cell lines
because of the unique features of IPF that are not readily
mimicked by any animal models. We insisted on using
primary human lung fibroblasts in our experiments; there￾fore, we are confident that these results represent a
mechanism that may actually occur in the human lung.
Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to work with primary
alveolar epithelial cells, and we had to resort to the epithelial
cell line A549. However, we present evidence obtained from
human lungs that suggest that the mechanisms that we
proposed in vitro do exist in the human IPF lung.
In summary, in this study we highlight the role of
osteopontin in human IPF. Although previous studies have
suggested that osteopontin has a potential profibrotic effect
in animal models of lung fibrosis, its role in human IPF was
unclear. We demonstrated that osteopontin is highly ex￾pressed in IPF lungs, and that it is primarily expressed by
hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells. We demonstrated that
osteopontin affected fibroblast and epithelial cell prolifer￾ation and migration, and that it had fibrosis-relevant effects
on MMP and TIMP expressions. Our results suggest a
mechanism explaining most of the profibrotic effects of
osteopontin by its direct effects on fibroblasts and epithelial
cells in the lungs. Furthermore, our results suggest that in IPF
the interaction between MMP-7 and osteopontin may be
involved in the relentlessly progressive nature of the disease,
and highlight osteopontin as a potential target for therapeu￾tic intervention in this incurable disease.

Patient summary
Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic progressive
disease of the lung that leads to increasing amounts of scar tissue with
subsequent destruction of the lung. There is no specific cure at present.
Patients may be treated with corticosteroids or drugs to suppress their
immune system, although these drugs are usually not effective. Some
patients receive lung transplants.
Why Was This Study Done? Previous work has suggested that a protein
called osteopontin is increased in mice that have lung fibrosis and that
mice that do not have the gene for osteopontin are protected from lung
fibrosis. The researchers wanted to investigate if osteopontin was also
involved in the human disease.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find? They looked at samples taken
from the lungs of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other
diseases and measured many genes that are expressed there. They found
that osteopontin was increased in the lungs of people with idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. They then looked at cultures of lung cells and found
that osteopontin caused an increase in the number and movement of
cells that are involved in lung fibrosis. Its presence also affected other
proteins that seem to be involved in fibrosis.
What Do These Findings Mean? Osteopontin may have a key role in
the pathway that causes fibrosis to occur in the lungs of people with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further work will need to be done to
confirm these results, but in the future drugs directed against
osteopontin or one of the related proteins might be a possible
treatment for the disease. Currently there are no such drugs. Additionally
osteopontin may be useful in the diagnosis and early detection of the
disease, but further studies are required.
