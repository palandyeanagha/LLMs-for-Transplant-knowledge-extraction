BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lack of cerebral circulation is an important confirmatory test for brain
death (BD). Conventional angiography remains the standard imaging method, but CT angiography
(CTA) is emerging as an alternative. France accepts BD diagnoses relying on a score based on lack of
opacification of 7 intracerebral vessels in CTA images. The purpose of this study was to validate the
efficiency of this score and to evaluate the sensitivity of a novel 4-point CTA score in confirming BD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective multicentric study was conducted during 12 months with
105 patients referred for CTA to confirm a clinical diagnosis of BD. Clinical data were recorded. CTA
images were interpreted first by local radiologists at the referent center, resulting in a 7-point score
based on lack of opacification of the pericallosal and cortical segments of the middle cerebral arteries
(MCAs), internal cerebral veins (ICVs), and 1 great cerebral vein per patient and, second, by a
consensus panel of 3 expert radiologists, blinded to the initial scores, resulting in novel 4-point scores
based on the lack of opacification of the cortical segments of the MCAs and ICVs.
RESULTS: Injection of contrast medium did not alter renal function. With the initial 7-point score,
sensitivity was 62.8%. With the simplified 4-point score, sensitivity was 85.7% and specificity was
100%. Opacification of ICVs was absent in 98.1% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Lack of opacification in the cortical segments of the MCAs and internal veins in CTA
is efficient and reliable for confirming BD.
The clinical criteria of brain death (BD), deep coma and
absence of brain stem reflexes, may be difficult to evaluate
in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the presence of
central nervous system (CNS) depressants.1 Many countries
require a clinical diagnosis of BD to be confirmed by a dem￾onstration of lack of brain cerebral function or circulation.
The methods accepted for such demonstrations include elec￾troencephalography (EEG), transcranial Doppler (TCD), and
conventional angiography. Legal requirements vary by coun￾try. For example, France requires 2 rounds of EEG with an
interval of 4 hours or conventional angiography.2-4 Although
conventional angiography remains the reference standard
method for demonstrating lack of cerebral circulation, CT an￾giography (CTA) is emerging as a viable alternative. CTA con￾fers a number of advantages: lower invasiveness, wider avail￾ability, lower operator dependence, greater rapidity, and
ability to evaluate patients in the presence of CNS depres￾sants. The efficiency of CTA for BD diagnosis was first dem￾onstrated in a study by Dupas et al,5 in which BD diagnosis
relied on a score based on lack of opacification of 7 intracere￾bral vessels: the pericallosal arteries, cortical segments of the
(MCA) arteries, internal cerebral veins (ICVs), and 1 great
cerebral vein (GCV) per patient. On the basis of that study,
France accepted the 7-point CTA score for BD diagnosis in
1998. Other studies have since demonstrated the persistence of
visualization of intracerebral vessels in BD. Dupas et al studied
a population of 14 BD patients and 11 healthy controls, but
larger studies are needed to validate their findings further.
This study aimed to validate the sensitivity of a simplified 4-point
CTA score based on lack of opacification of the cortical segments
of the MCAs and the ICVs in confirming the clinical diagnosis
of BD.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
We prospectively evaluated 105 patients diagnosed with clinical BD at
6 centers from January to December 2005. All patients in the ICU with
clinical BD were considered eligible. For 12 months, the ICU referred
105 BD patients for confirmatory CTA (47 women, 58 men; mean
age, 49.2 years; age range, 16 –76 years). Initial causes of coma were
head trauma (n  36); cerebral hemorrhage (n  45), with 48%
from aneurysm rupture; cerebral stroke (n  4); anoxia (n  11); and
cerebral hypertension (n  9).
All clinical criteria for BD were present in all 105 patients before
CTA, including a positive apnea test (duration, 10 –15 minutes; 15-
minute preoxygenation with 100% oxygen; oxygenation catheter at
the trachea level at a rate of 6 L/min; a partial pressure of carbon
dioxide value of 60 mm Hg or higher confirmed apnea).
Data Collection
Demographic data, initial causes, and the following were recorded for
all patients: the time between initial coma and clinical BD diagnosis;
the use of vasoactive agents and resuscitation fluids, arterial pressure,
renal function before and after CTA, and organ harvest.
CTA
Multidetector CT scans were acquired following the protocol out￾lined by Dupas et al.5After a lateral topography, 3 similar acquisitions
were planned starting at the C1-C2 level to the convexity. The first
phase was without injection of contrast. A nonionic contrast medium

(120 mL; concentration 300 mg/mL) was injected through an ante￾cubital vein at a rate of 3 mL/s by using a power injector and an
18-gauge catheter. The second and third scans were then acquired,
starting 20 and 60 seconds after the contrast medium injection
commenced. The same geometric parameters were used to allow fur￾ther subtractions. Images were acquired with a section thickness of
1 mm (pitch, 0.5–1); scanning parameters were 120 kV, 300 mAs,
200-mm FOV, and 512  512 matrix. Contiguous axial images
(5 mm) were then reconstructed. Subtractions of the precontrast and
postcontrast series and sagittal reformations were performed as
needed.
Vessel Opacification and CTA Scores
CTA images were first interpreted by local radiologists at the 6 referent
centers, to confirm clinical BD; then all examinations were reviewed by 3
expert radiologists blinded to the results of the first interpretation to
assess lack of opacification and resolve discrepant initial interpretations.
Opacification of superficial temporal arteries was assessed on the second
phase at 20 seconds to confirm the correct injection of contrast medium.
The third phase, at 60 seconds, was used to evaluate opacification of the
following vessels: pericallosal arteries, cortical segments of the MCAs,
right and left ICVs, and GCV (Fig 1). Following Dupas et al,5 a point was
given for each vessel without opacification, resulting in “lack of opacifi￾cation” scores of between 0 and 7. Opacification of the basilar artery (BA)
was also recorded for all patients. The same dataset was then used to
construct a novel 4-point CTA score based on the lack of opacification of
cortical segments of the MCAs and the 2 ICVs.
Confirming CTA Score BD Diagnosis
The 7-point CTA scores were used for diagnosing BD, scores of 7 indi￾cating BD (Fig 2). Patients with scores 7 were given a complementary
examination to assess BD: delayed CTA (n  10 patients), conventional
angiography (n  10), or 2 EEGs (n  12). Data were missing for 7
patients.

Results
Clinical Data
The mean interval between the initial coma and absence of
brain stem reflexes and apnea test was 67 hours and 87 hours,
respectively. During their ICU stay, 96.2% of patients were
administered vasopressive agents (adrenalin for 93.3%). At
the time of CTA, the mean minimal systolic arterial pressure
was 114  29.19 mm Hg, 92.4% of patients had been treated
with catecholamine, and 42.8% had undergone fluid resusci￾tation. The respective mean creatinemia before and after CTA
was 101.1 and 89 mol/L; and the respective mean uremia was
6.6 and 5.79 mol/L, indicating that the injection of contrast
medium did not alter renal function. Confirmed BD led to
organ harvesting in 75 patients.
Vessel Opacification and CTA Scores
Residual vessel opacification was determined by visual an￾alysis, by using a comparison between unenhanced and en￾hanced CT scans. The superficial temporal arteries were
opacified at 20 seconds in all patients, confirming proper in￾jection of the contrast medium; and they were still visualized
at 60 seconds.
Seven-Point CTA Scores. Sixty-six patients had CTA
scores of 7 (sensitivity 62.8%) with a lack of opacification of
pericallosal arteries, cortical segments of the MCAs, ICVs, and
GCV; 16.2% (n  17) of patients had scores of 6 mainly due to
persistent pericallosal artery visualization. Lower scores of 5
(n  7), 4 (n  8), 3 (n  5), 2 (n  1), and 1 (n  1) were also
recorded, mainly due to, first, the pericallosal arteries and,
second, the cortical segments of the MCAs. ICV opacification
was absent in 103 (98.1%) patients. For the 2 patients with 1
residual opacified ICV, the score was 2. For 1 patient, the
only opacified vessels were the GCV and the BA (Table 1).
Four-Point CTA Scores. Eighty-five and seven tenths per￾cent of patients had a score of four; 7.6% had scores of three;
4.8% had scores of 2, and 1.9% had a score of 1 (Table 2).
CTA Score Confirming BD Diagnosis
The complementary examinations to confirm BD diagnoses
based on the 7-point CTA score were as follows: The mean
interval for the second CTA was 99  68 hours; the second
CTA score was 7 for 8 of the 10 patients and 6 and 4 for the
other 2. In all cases, conventional angiography and EEGs con￾firmed brain death. Data were missing for 7 patients.
Discussion
The novel 4-point CTA score based on the lack of opacifica￾tion of 4, instead of 7, cerebral vessels appears more sensitive
in confirming BD than the accepted 7-point CTA score. A
demonstration of lack of cerebral circulation may be required
for BD confirmation. Ideally, the technique for such a demon￾stration would be noninvasive, easily accessible, operator-in￾dependent, highly specific, and highly sensitive. Conventional
angiography is highly sensitive, but it is invasive and time￾consuming and requires an experienced neuroradiologist,
leading to delayed examinations.6 CTA is emerging as a viable
alternative and was accepted by the French Agency of Biomed￾icine for BD confirmation in 1998 after its utility was demon￾strated by Dupas et al7 in a study of 25 subjects (14 BD patients
and 11 controls). Dupas et al developed a 7-point CTA score
based on lack of opacification of 7 cerebral vessels, with scores
of 7 indicating BD. However, larger prospective studies were
needed to validate CTA for BD diagnoses, and only a few re￾ports are available in the literature.7-9
Since this first study, follow-up studies by others investigated
the efficacy of the 7-point CTA score and demonstrated residual
arterial opacification on CTA in clinically BD patients, particu￾larly for the pericallosal and horizontal portions of the MCAs.
This phenomenon is called “stasis filling” and necessitates repet￾itive CTAs, increasing the waiting period between clinical brain
death and radiologic confirmation to 71 hours.10
A study of 43 patients byCombes et al11 found that the 7-point
score had a sensitivity of 69.7% compared with conventional an￾giography; 76.9% of divergent cases were due to opacification of
the anterior cerebral arteries (in 38.5% of the patients, they were
the only opacified vessels). There was no opacification of BAs.
With the novel 4-point CTA score, which does not include those
vessels, the sensitivity would have been 81.4%.
In the present study, 37.1% of patients had opacified resid￾ual vessels. A single persistent pericallosal artery opacification
was present in 16 of the 17 patients with a CTA score of 6; both
arteries were opacified in all 7 patients with a score of 5. With
the new 4-point CTA score, sensitivity was 85.7%, obviating
new examinations. Nine of 11 patients who had a second CTA
(mean interval, 99 hours) had a score of 7. Pericallosal arteries
were still opacified for 2 patients. One had an opacified cortical
artery, but no venous return was noted. Leclerc et al12 found
similar results; and on the basis of their data, the sensitivity of
the 4-point CTA score would have been 93.3%. Together with
the present findings, this suggests that the absence of ICVs and
bilateral cortical branches of the MCAs constitutes the best
criterion of BD diagnosis by using CTA. The absence of the

ICV also appears to be the most sensitive and earliest sign.
Both internal veins were absent in 98.1% of the patients.
Quesnel et al13 found similar results; 85.7% of their patients
lacked deep venous return.
In the present study, 2 patients had 1 residual opacified
ICV, but the score was low (2). One patient had opacifica￾tion of only the GCV, leading to a score of 6, but the BA was
opacified at 20 and 60 seconds. This was previously described
by Braun et al14 in intravenous angiography with residual flow
in the vertebrobasilar system, despite clinical BD. These find￾ings suggest that it was judicial to exclude the GCV for the
4-point score.
The novel 4-point CTA score appears more sensitive
(85.7%) and requires analysis of only 4 vessels. Whereas the
cortical segments of the MCAs were assessable in all previous
studies,11,12 the excluded cerebral veins were deemed difficult
to assess because of cerebral hemorrhage or edema. Strict
comparison of unenhanced and enhanced images, additional
sagittal and axial subtractions, is helpful for confirming lack of
opacification. CTA remains a 100% specific method as shown
by the 10 conventional angiographies and 12 EEGs performed
when the CTA score was 7.
An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), leading to cere￾bral circulation arrest, is a major consideration. CTA, given its
high sensitivity for vessel visualization, does not appear to be
efficient for patients with craniotomy, as previously reported,
with intravenous angiography leading to false-negative re￾sults.14 To avoid repetitive examinations, we recommend an
interval of 6 hours before CTA, particularly in cases of an￾oxia, because of progressive increase of ICP. In the present
study, data on the interval between clinical BD diagnosis and
the first CTA were missing due to logistic problems, so we
could not evaluate the potential statistical difference between
the score and interval.
Many countries require clinical diagnoses of BD to be con￾firmed by a demonstration of lack of brain cerebral function or
circulation. The methods accepted for such demonstration in￾clude EEG, TCD, and radionuclide brain perfusion, but con￾ventional angiography remains the reference standard. EEG
cannot be performed or may be difficult to interpret in pa￾tients with hypothermia, severe metabolic disorders, drug in￾toxication, or hemodynamic instability; conventional angiog￾raphy is needed.15 TCD, a noninvasive bedside method to test
cerebral circulation arrest, is not influenced by sedative agents.
A meta-analysis by Monteiro et al16 found a TCD sensitivity of
95% and specificity of 99%; and Poularas et al17 found 100%
concurrence between TCD and angiography. Persistent intra￾cranial diastolic flow may be present in patients with a BD
diagnosis based on the clinical or EEG or conventional angiog￾raphy criteria.18
Its high sensitivity notwithstanding, TCD is operator-de￾pendent, and 5%–10% of patients cannot be examined be￾cause of the absence of bone window or initial flow19,20; more￾over, posterior circulation can be difficult to analyze. TCD
could be useful to determine the most appropriate interval for
CTA, to avoid repetitive examinations. Other efficient meth￾ods, such as radionuclide brain perfusion, can shorten time to
BD confirmation and improve organ harvest rates. However,
they remain costly, and sensitivity was 62% in a study of 58
patients by Newberg et al.21
Ancillary confirmatory testing practices vary worldwide. In
the United States, for example, EEG is performed in 84% of
main neurologic hospitals; conventional angiography, in 74%;
and CTA, in only 6%.22 The main advantages of CTA are that
it is a highly sensitive imaging examination with an operator￾independent standard protocol, has a simplified score, and has
greater accessibility. Moreover, CT is not limited to brain: The
whole body can be examined simultaneously. Indeed, chest,
abdominal, and pelvic examinations are now routinely inte￾grated in our CT protocol for assessing BD. This additional
information provides further insights into organ vasculature
and abnormalities before harvesting.
Conclusions
The novel 4-point CTA score based on nonopacification of the
cortical segments of the MCAs and the ICVs appears highly
sensitive for confirming brain death, maintaining a specificity
of 100%. Absence of opacification of ICVs is the most sensitive
sign. Compared with other ancillary tests for BD, CTA is reli￾able, standardized, and widely accessible and can examine the
whole body, making it particularly useful in cases in which
there is a potential for organ harvesting.
