Background: Interferon a (IFN-a) activated cellular signalling is negatively regulated by inhibitory factors,
including the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) family. The effects of host factors such as obesity on
hepatic expression of these inhibitory factors in subjects with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) are unknown.
Objectives: To assess the independent effects of obesity, insulin resistance, and steatosis on response to
IFN-a therapy and to determine hepatic expression of factors inhibiting IFN-a signalling in obese and non￾obese subjects with chronic HCV.
Methods: A total of 145 subjects were analysed to determine host factors associated with non-response to
antiviral therapy. Treatment comprised IFN-a or peginterferon alpha, either alone or in combination with
ribavirin. In a separate cohort of 73 patients, real time-polymerase chain reaction was performed to
analyse hepatic mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry for SOCS-3 was performed on liver biopsy
samples from 38 patients with viral genotype 1 who had received antiviral treatment.
Results: Non-response (NR) to treatment occurred in 55% of patients with HCV genotypes 1 or 4 and 22%
with genotypes 2 or 3. Factors independently associated with NR were viral genotype 1/4 (p,0.001),
cirrhosis on pretreatment biopsy (p = 0.025), and body mass index > 30 kg/m2 (p = 0.010). Obese
subjects with viral genotype 1 had increased hepatic mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy
kinase (p = 0.01) and SOCS-3 (p = 0.047), in comparison with lean subjects. Following multivariate
analysis, SOCS-3 mRNA expression remained independently associated with obesity (p = 0.023). SOCS-3
immunoreactivity was significantly increased in obesity (p = 0.013) and in non-responders compared with
responders (p = 0.014).
Conclusions: In patients with chronic HCV viral genotype 1, increased expression of factors that inhibit
interferon signalling may be one mechanism by which obesity reduces the biological response to IFN-a.
Despite an improvement in the efficacy of antiviral
treatment in recent years, approximately 50% of
patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype
1 and 20% of those with HCV genotype 3 fail to achieve
sustained viral clearance.1 Along with viral genotype and
load,2 various host genetic and biological factors have a role
in the resistance to interferon alpha (IFN-a) therapy. These
host factors include sex, age, ethnicity, and genetic variation
in human leucocyte antigens and cytokine production
(reviewed by Gao and colleagues3
). In addition, patients
with advanced fibrosis have a decreased response to antiviral
treatment.4
In order to increase the number of patients achieving a
sustained virological response (SVR), there is a need to
identify modifiable risk factors that impact on treat￾ment efficacy. As a result, there is increasing interest in the
role of obesity and hepatic steatosis in this setting.
Steatosis may adversely affect the response to antiviral
therapy.5 6 In patients with non-genotype 3 infection, the
presence of steatosis was a predictor of failed treatment7 8
and those with less steatosis were more likely to achieve
SVR.6 However, it is unlikely that steatosis intrinsically
impairs antiviral efficacy as steatosis associated with viral
genotype 3 does not appear to adversely affect the response to
treatment.6 Other investigators found that an elevated body
mass index (BMI) in the obese range of .30 kg/m2
, rather
than steatosis per se, was associated with therapeutic non￾response.9
Obesity and steatosis are clearly interrelated and it remains
unclear whether their reported effects are truly indepen￾dent.10 A number of studies have found that patients with a
higher body weight have reduced response rates following
antiviral therapy.11–14 In the absence of weight based dosing,
treatment failure in obese patients may be due to inadequate
drug doses leading to lower serum levels of IFN-a.
15 Other
mechanisms by which obesity may impair antiviral response
such as by reducing the biological response to IFN-a are not
well understood. Interaction of IFN-a with a cell surface
receptor leads to a series of intracellular reactions that result
in transcriptional induction of several antiviral and immu￾noregulatory genes.3 This IFN-a-activated signalling is
negatively regulated by a number of inhibitory factors,
including the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)

family.3 16–18 Several studies have found that patients with
high tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a) levels have a poor
response to IFN-a therapy19–21 and this may occur via
induction of SOCS proteins22 that interfere with the interac￾tion between the IFN-a receptor and signalling proteins.16
Obesity and steatosis are known to be associated with
elevated levels of TNF-a23 24 and more recent studies have
shown increased hepatic expression of SOCS proteins in
insulin resistant states.25 26
The aims of this study were to evaluate the independent
effects of obesity, hepatic steatosis, and obesity related
metabolic factors on the response to antiviral therapy in
patients with chronic HCV infection. In addition, we
examined hepatic expression of the IFN-a receptor 1 (IFN￾R1) and factors that may inhibit IFN-a signalling (TNF-a,
SOCS-3), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK)
as a marker of hepatic insulin sensitivity in obese and non￾obese subjects with chronic HCV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study populations
This study was a retrospective review of patients with chronic
HCV seen at a single centre between 1995 and 2004. Subjects
were included in the current study if they fulfilled the
following criteria: (a) chronic HCV with circulating HCV RNA
(detected by Amplicor HCV Monitor assay; Roche, New
Jersey, USA) and abnormal serum aminotransferase levels
for at least six months; (b) liver biopsy consistent with
chronic hepatitis; (c) compensated liver disease; and (d)
written informed consent for inclusion in the study. Patients
with other forms of chronic liver disease or antibodies to
human immunodeficiency virus were not considered for the
analysis. The study protocol was approved by both the
Princess Alexandra Hospital Research Ethics Committee and
the University of Queensland Research Ethics Committee.
A total of 145 subjects received antiviral therapy.
Treatment comprised IFN-a or peginterferon alpha (PEG￾IFN-a) either alone or in combination with ribavirin. As the
purpose of the study was to determine the effect of host
factors on treatment outcome, only subjects who completed
80% of the intended doses of antiviral therapy were
evaluated. In an additional group of 73 untreated patients
with chronic HCV, liver tissue (2–3 mm) was immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of biopsy and stored at
280˚C until extraction of RNA was performed.
Details on weight, height, and average alcohol intake (g/
day) were obtained from all patients at the time of treatment
and/or liver biopsy. Information regarding average alcohol
intake (g/day) prior to the last six months was also obtained.
Subjects receiving antiviral therapy were required to consume
,70 g ethanol per week for > 6 months prior to treatment
and were abstinent during treatment.
Sex, ethnicity, and age at treatment were also recorded. On
the basis of BMI and ethnicity, subjects were classified as
lean (Caucasian ,25 kg/m2
, Asian ,22.5 kg/m2
), overweight
(Caucasian 25–29.9 kg/m2
, Asian 23–24.9 kg/m2
), or obese
(Caucasian >30 kg/m2
, Asian >25 kg/m2
).
Histopathological examination
Liver biopsy sections were analysed by an experienced
hepatopathologist (AC) who was blinded to the laboratory
parameters and clinical data. The degree of inflammation was
graded according to the method of Ishak27 and fibrosis was
staged according to the method of Scheuer.28 Steatosis was
graded as follows: 0 (,5% hepatocytes affected); 1 (mild, 5–29%
of hepatocytes affected); 2 (moderate, 30–70% of hepatocytes
affected); or 3 (severe, .70% of hepatocytes affected).
Laboratory data
Viral genotyping was performed using the Inno-Lipa HCV II
assay (Innogenetics, Zwijnaarde, Belgium). Circulating HCV
RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using
the Amplicor HCV assay (Roche, New Jersey, USA). SVR was
defined as undetectable HCV RNA at the end of 24 weeks of
follow up after completion of treatment. Patients were
responders (RES) if they had undetectable HCV RNA on
completion of antiviral therapy. Patients who had detectable
HCV RNA on treatment completion were defined as non￾responders (NR). Serum was collected at the time of liver
biopsy following an overnight fast for eight hours. Standard
biochemical tests were performed using a Hitachi 747-100
Analyser (Roche, Australia). Circulating insulin and C peptide
levels were determined using the Tosoh AIA600 analyser, two
site immunoenzymometric assays (Tosoh Medics, San
Francisco, California, USA). Insulin resistance was determined
using the homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA).29
Real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
methods
Steady state mRNA levels of PEPCK, TNF-a, SOCS-3, and
IFN-R1 were assessed by semi quantitative RT-PCR assays,
using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
as a housekeeping gene. Total RNA was extracted from liver
biopsy tissue (n = 73) according to the Trizol method
(Invitrogen, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). cDNA was
prepared by reverse transcription, as previously described.30
The probe and primer sequences for GAPDH and TNF-a
were as described previously.30 Primer sequences for IFN-R1,
SOCS-3, and PEPCK were designed using online software
Primer 3 (http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/pri￾mer3www.cgi) (table 1) and were purchased from Proligo
Australia Pty Ltd (Lismore, New South Wales, Australia).
PEPCK and TNF-a mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR
using a TAMRA-FAM probe, as previously described.30 mRNA
expression of SOCS-3 and IFN-R1 was determined using
SYBR green chemistry. Diluted (1/20) cDNA (5 ml) was added
to a PCR mix containing 6.70 ml sterile water, 12.5 ml 26
SYBR mix (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia), and
0.4 ml each of forward and reverse primers to make up a final
volume of 25 ml. Cycling conditions for amplification were
95˚C for 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 94˚C for
15 seconds, 60˚C for 30 seconds, and 72˚for 30 seconds in a
Rotorgene 3000 (Corbett Robotics, Brisbane, Australia). Each
assay was performed in duplicate and analysis was performed
using Rotorgene Analysis Software (Corbett Robotics).

Relative concentrations of mRNAs present were deter￾mined as previously described.30 For each gene, the average of
the duplicate assays was obtained and normalised to the
average amount of GAPDH for each sample to determine
relative changes in mRNA expression.
Immunohistochemistry for SOCS-3
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded liver biopsy samples from
38 of the subjects infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4 who
subsequently received antiviral therapy were used for
immunohistochemical analysis of SOCS-3 expression, as
previously described.30 The primary antibody used in the
study was anti-SOCS-3 (Fusion Antibodies, Belfast, Northern
Ireland; dilution 1/100). Tissue sections were photographed
using a PixeLink Colour Digital Camera (Total Turnkey
Solutions, Mona Vale, New South Wales, Australia) mounted
on an Olympus BX-40 microscope (Olympus Australia Pty
Ltd, Mt Waverley, Victoria, Australia).
Image analysis was used to quantify the immunoreactivity
of SOCS-3. A minimum of 30 non-overlapping fields at a
magnification of 6400 were photographed. Image analysis
software (Image Pro Plus 4.5; SciTech Pty Ltd, Preston,
Victoria) was used to assess the mean immunoreactive area
per biopsy. Per cent positive area was defined as the ratio of
pixels set above the segmentation threshold to the total
number of pixels within a defined area of interest. For each
section, per cent positive area for replicate fields was averaged.
Statistical analysis
Continuous normally distributed variables were represented
graphically as mean (SEM). Grade of steatosis, stage of fibrosis,
and alcohol consumption were summarised using the median.
The x2 or Fisher’s exact tests were used to determine differences
in patient distribution between RES and NR and between SVR
and NR for variables such as sex, cirrhosis on pretreatment
biopsy, presence of steatosis, and BMI categories. To compare
the means of normally distributed variables, analysis of variance
(ANOVA) or Student’s t tests were performed. To determine
differences between groups for non-normally distributed
variables, medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney
U test. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to measure the
degree of association between continuous normally distributed
variables. The degree of association between non-normally
distributed or ordinal variables was assessed using Spearman’s
non-parametric correlation. Binary logistic regression was used
to determine discrete factors associated with NR, adjusting for
age at treatment, sex, previous alcohol consumption, presence
of steatosis, cirrhosis, type of treatment received, viral genotype,
and BMI. ANCOVA was performed to identify predictors of
normally distributed variables such as SOCS-3, adjusting for
factors such as age, sex, BMI, HOMA, cirrhosis on pretreatment
biopsy, previous alcohol consumption, and presence of steatosis.
A backward elimination approach was used to remove non￾significant variables and determine the most parsimonious
model. All analysis was carried out using SPSS software version
11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Statistical significance
was taken at the 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics and antiviral regimes
Of a total of 218 patients, 145 (95% Caucasian, 5% Asian)
received antiviral therapy and 73 (100% Caucasian) com￾prised the RT-PCR cohort. Overall, mean age of the patients
was 41.2 (0.6) years and 156 (72%) were male. Viral
genotype was 1 in 99 (45.4%), 2 in five (2.3%), 3 in 112
(51.3%), and 4 in two (1%). BMI was classified as lean in 101
patients (46.3%), overweight in 84 (38.5%), and obese in 33
(15.1%). Median prior alcohol intake was 20 (3–60) g/day.
Thirty three patients (15.1%) had cirrhosis on liver biopsy.
One hundred (45.9%) patients had no steatosis, 71 (32.6%)
had mild steatosis, and 47 (21.5%) had moderate or severe
steatosis. Mean fasting insulin level (available for 146
patients) was 9.1 (0.64) mU/l, mean HOMA score was 2.02
(0.19), and mean C peptide level was 0.73 (0.03) nmol/l.
Within each viral genotype, there were no significant
differences between patients who received antiviral therapy
and those in the RT-PCR group, except that those who
received therapy were slightly older (42.3 (0.7) v 39.0
(1.0) years, respectively; p = 0.018).

A total of 145 subjects fulfilled the criteria for the
treatment arm of the study; 128 patients received combina￾tion therapy with ribavirin and either standard IFN-a
(n = 108) or PEG-IFN-a (n = 20), and 17 patients received
IFN-a (n = 14) or PEG-IFN-a (n = 3) monotherapy.
Effect of host factors on treatment outcome
NR was seen in 36 patients (55%) with HCV genotypes 1 or 4
and in 17 (22%) with viral genotypes 2 or 3 (table 2). Among
patients with viral genotype 1 or 4, subjects with NR were
more likely to have cirrhosis on pretreatment biopsy
(p = 0.003) and to be obese (p = 0.004) but there was no
difference in the prevalence or severity of steatosis or mean
levels of circulating insulin, C peptide, or HOMA scores
between patients with NR and RES. In patients with viral
genotypes 2 or 3, there was no significant difference in host
characteristics between subjects with NR or those with RES
(table 2). Median alcohol intake did not differ between
subjects with NR or RES (data not shown).
Following multivariate analysis, variables independently
associated with NR were viral genotype 1/4 (p,0.001),
presence of cirrhosis on pretreatment biopsy (p = 0.025), and
obesity (p = 0.010) (table 3). When comparing patients with
NR with those with SVR, these factors remained independently
associated with treatment non-response (data not shown).
In comparison with non-obese patients, obese subjects with
viral genotype 1/4 were more likely to have steatosis (p,0.001)
and had higher fasting serum insulin (p = 0.041) and C peptide
(p = 0.041) levels and higher HOMA scores (0.026). In patients
with viral genotype 2/3, obesity was also associated with higher
grades of steatosis (p = 0.035). However, there was no
significant difference in fasting serum insulin and C peptide
levels or HOMA scores between obese patients and non-obese
subjects (table 4) for patients with genotype 2/3.
Eleven of the 12 obese subjects with genotype 1/4 and 9 of
11 obese subjects with genotype 2/3 had steatosis, illustrating
the close interrelationship between these factors. Twenty
three of 54 non-obese subjects (43%) with genotype 1 and 42
of 68 non-obese subjects (63%) with genotype 2/3 also had
steatosis. In these non-obese subjects, the presence of
steatosis did not impair the ability to achieve RES (viral
genotype 1/4, p = 0.50; viral genotype 2/3, p = 0.21).
Relationship between obesity, hepatic insulin
sensitivity, and SOCS-3
To determine the effect of obesity on factors that may impair
the IFN-a signalling cascade, PEPCK, TNF-a, SOCS-3, and
IFN-R1 mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR in 73
patients with chronic HCV.
In patients infected with viral genotype 1 (n = 35), obese
subjects had increased hepatic expression of SOCS-3 mRNA
compared with lean subjects (p = 0.047) (fig 1). By univariate
analysis, SOCS-3 mRNA was associated with BMI (p = 0.047)
but with no other demographic or histological feature.
Following multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex,
presence of cirrhosis, steatosis, and HOMA score, the
relationship between SOCS-3 mRNA expression and obesity
remained significant (p = 0.023).
Similarly, obese subjects had increased hepatic expression
of PEPCK mRNA compared with lean subjects (p,0.01) and
this relationship remained significant after multivariate
analysis adjusting for age, sex, presence of cirrhosis, steatosis,
and HOMA score (p,0.001). In lean subjects, there was a
significant inverse relationship between HOMA score and
hepatic PEPCK mRNA levels (r = 20.45, p = 0.01), consistent
with the role of insulin in regulation of PEPCK gene
expression. In contrast, in overweight and obese subjects,
there was no association between HOMA score and PEPCK
mRNA levels (r = 0.004, p = 0.98). These results provide

circumstantial evidence that in comparison with lean
patients, our obese subjects had impaired hepatic insulin
sensitivity. Although we did not find a relationship between
SOCS-3 expression and markers of systemic insulin resistance
such as HOMA, insulin, and C peptide, there was a significant
association between SOCS-3 mRNA levels and PEPCK mRNA
levels (r = 0.5, p = 0.0092). This may reflect a relationship
between SOCS-3 expression and hepatic insulin resistance.
The increase in expression of TNF-a in obese subjects
compared with lean subjects approached significance
(p = 0.071) (fig 1). In patients with viral genotype 1, there
was a significant correlation between TNF-a and PEPCK
mRNA levels (r = 0.34, p,0.001) and between TNF-a and
SOCS-3 mRNA levels (r = 0.72, p,0.001).
In patients infected with viral genotype 3, there was no
significant difference in SOCS-3, PEPCK, or TNF-a mRNA
expression between obese and lean subjects (p = 0.46,
p = 0.67, p = 0.59, respectively). No relationship was seen
between IFN-R1 mRNA levels and BMI or other markers of
insulin resistance for all genotypes (data not shown).
Increased hepatic SOCS-3 expression in patients with
treatment non-response
To address the association between SOCS-3 expression and
response to antiviral therapy, immunohistochemistry for
SOCS-3 was performed in liver sections from subjects
infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4 who subsequently received
antiviral therapy. Immunoreactive product was seen in liver
biopsies from all patients who were treatment non-respon￾ders, and all patients, except one, who were responders.
Staining was present predominantly in hepatocytes and was
localised to the cytoplasm. Hepatocytes were positive in
periportal and other areas of the lobules. Immunoreactive
staining was also present in bile ducts but only infrequently
in Kupffer cells and portal macrophages. (fig 2)
Compared with responders, patients who were non￾responders had significantly higher mean levels of SOCS-3
immunoreactivity (p = 0.014) (fig 3). After correcting for age,
sex, presence of cirrhosis on pretreatment biopsy, HOMA
score, previous ethanol consumption, steatosis, and BMI,
increased SOCS-3 protein expression was independently
associated with treatment NR in patients with viral genotype
1 (p,0.0001).
SOCS-3 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in non￾lean subjects compared with lean subjects (p,0.013). By
univariate analysis, SOCS-3 immunoreactivity was not
associated with any other demographic, metabolic, or
histological feature. Following multivariate analysis adjust￾ing for age, sex, presence of cirrhosis, steatosis, and HOMA
score, the relationship between SOCS-3 immunoreactivity
and obesity remained significant (p = 0.012).
DISCUSSION
In this single centre study, obesity was independently
associated with non-response to antiviral therapy in subjects
infected with HCV genotype 1. Virtually all obese subjects
(87%) had steatosis, underlining the interrelationship between
these variables. However, steatosis was also present in 55% of
non-obese subjects. In these latter patients, the presence or
severity of hepatic steatosis did not influence the ability to
achieve a response to treatment. In support of these findings, a
recent study by Bressler and colleagues also demonstrated that
obesity but not hepatic steatosis was an independent negative
predictor of response to HCV treatment.9
Many previous studies of both standard and pegylated
interferon have identified body weight as a factor impacting
on treatment response rates.11–14 31 It remains unclear whether
weight based dosing would improve the response rate or
whether obesity is associated with a greater degree of
resistance to antiviral therapy.1 In this study, we demon￾strated that obese subjects infected with HCV genotype 1 had
increased hepatic expression of SOCS-3, a factor that has
been shown to inhibit IFN-a signalling. This relationship
between obesity and increased SOCS-3 expression remained
significant after correction for other factors associated with
non-response to treatment.
Importantly, patients with HCV genotype 1 who were NR
had significantly higher levels of SOCS-3 protein expression
compared with RES. Engagement of IFN-a with its receptor
activates receptor associated tyrosine kinases that phosphor￾ylate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
factors 1 and 2.32 33 Phosphorylated STAT proteins migrate to
the nucleus and induce transcription of several antiviral
target genes. This IFN-a signalling pathway is downregulated
by members of the SOCS family of proteins.18 34 SOCS 1 and 3
have been shown to inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation and
nuclear translocation of STAT 1 in response to IFN-a
stimulation and this inhibition occurs at very low levels of
SOCS protein expression.35
Several factors, including the HCV core protein,17 liver
toxins,22 and various cytokines36 37 have been shown to induce
hepatic SOCS-3 expression. In chronic HCV, TNF-a may have
a key role in this inhibitory pathway. TNF-a levels are
increased in the serum,38 liver, and peripheral blood

mononuclear cells20 of subjects with chronic HCV compared
with control subjects. Higher pretreatment intrahepatic19 and
peripheral blood mononuclear cell20 TNF-a mRNA levels were
observed in patients who subsequently failed to respond to
IFN-a therapy compared with those subjects who had an
SVR. More recently, Hong et al have shown in a mouse model
that injection of TNF-a markedly induced expression of
SOCS-3, resulting in inhibition of IFN-a signalling in hepatic
cells.22 In our cohort of patients with chronic HCV, there was
a striking correlation between TNF-a and SOCS-3 mRNA
levels, consistent with a role for this cytokine in induction of
SOCS-3 expression in vivo.
Importantly, expression of SOCS-3 in the liver is induced
by cytokines and hormones that are associated with obesity
dependent insulin resistance.39 Upregulation of hepatic
SOCS-1 and -3 mRNA and proteins has been observed in
various insulin resistant animal models.26 A marked decrease
in SOCS-3 expression was found in obese mice lacking TNF-a
signalling, supporting the premise that elevated levels of
SOCS-3 in obesity may be related to increased TNF-a
expression.40 In our study, obese subjects with viral genotype
1 had increased hepatic expression of PEPCK compared with
non-obese subjects, consistent with impaired hepatocyte
insulin sensitivity. PEPCK catalyses a key step in gluconeo￾genesis and insulin decreases the transcription of its gene.41
Insulin resistance is associated with failure of insulin to
suppress the activity of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis
leading to increased hepatic glucose production.42 In our
cohort of subjects with chronic HCV, highly significant
correlations were seen between hepatic PEPCK and both
TNF-a and SOCS-3 mRNA levels. Similar to their inhibitory
role in IFN-a signalling, TNF-a and SOCS-3 may act as
negative regulators in insulin signalling.25
In our patients infected with viral genotype 3, there was no
statistically significant difference in markers of insulin
resistance or hepatic gene expression of PEPCK, SOCS-3, or
TNF-a between obese and non-obese patients. It remains
unclear why the effect of obesity on hepatic insulin resistance
and expression of SOCS-3 was seen in subjects with viral
genotype 1 but not genotype 3. The prevalence of cirrhosis was
higher in the cohort of subjects infected with viral genotypes 1
or 4, and this may have contributed to an overall increase in
insulin resistance in this population. However, the relation￾ships between obesity and expression of PEPCK, SOCS-3, or
TNF-a were found to be independent of the presence of
cirrhosis. Interestingly, a previous study has also shown that
subjects with genotype 3 have lower levels of insulin resistance
compared with other viral genotypes.43 In addition, the
increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes in chronic
HCV appears to be largely among non-genotype 3 infected
subjects.43–45 In contrast with the effect of obesity on hepatic
gene expression, no differences in mRNA levels studied were
seen between subjects with or without hepatic steatosis.
A number of earlier studies demonstrated that a sustained
response to antiviral therapy is dependent on high levels of
expression of the IFN-a receptor.46 47 Information regarding
the regulation of expression of the interferon receptor in
chronic HCV remains limited. In our study, we found no
difference in expression of the IFN-R1 between obese and

non-obese subjects. Although a previous study demonstrated
downregulation of IFN-R1 mRNA in fibrotic livers,48 we did
not observe this finding in our subjects with chronic HCV.
In summary, in our cohort of patients with chronic HCV,
BMI > 30 kg/m2 was independently associated with non￾response to antiviral therapy. In subjects with viral genotype 1,
obesity was associated with increased PEPCK mRNA levels,
consistent with impaired hepatocyte insulin sensitivity, and
with increased expression of TNF-a and SOCS-3, factors that
may reduce interferon signalling. Induction of hepatic SOCS-3
expression may be one mechanism by which obesity reduces
the biological response to IFN-a in patients infected with viral
genotype 1.
