Arterioportal fistulae (APFs) are classified into intrahe￾patic (>75% of all reported APFs) and extrahepatic (<25% of
all reported APFs).1 Anecdotally, physicians are more likely to
report more sensational cases (extrahepatic APFs), so the
actual prevalence of intrahepatic APFs is probably much
higher (>90%). Reportedly, all APFs in liver transplant recip￾ients have been intrahepatic APFs.1–3 APFs are further classi￾fied into hemodynamically significant and hemodynamically
insignificant. The determinant of hemodynamic significance
is Doppler ultrasound findings suggestive of involvement of
the main, right, or left portal vein.1–4
This article discusses APFs that are specific to liver trans￾plant recipients. Their incidence, etiology, pathogenesis, nat￾ural history, clinical presentation, imaging evaluation, and
endovascular management are discussed in detail.
Incidence and Etiology
Incidence
Hemodynamically significant APFs in liver transplant recip￾ients are rare, occurring in 0.2% of cases.2 There appears to be
no difference in occurrence between living related (split rafts)
and deceased donor (split or whole grafts).2 However, APFs
(hemodynamically significant or not) are not uncommonly
seen in hepatic angiograms of liver transplant recipients,
reported in up to 5.4% of hepatic arteriograms in this patient
population.1,5–7 Interestingly, hemodynamically significant

Abstract Arterioportal fistulas (APFs) are classified into intrahepatic (>75% of all reported) and
extrahepatic (<25% of all reported ). Anecdotally, investigators are more likely to report
more sensational cases (typically extrahepatic APFs), so the actual prevalence of
intrahepatic APFs is probably much higher (likely >90% of APFs). All reported APFs in
liver transplant recipients have been intrahepatic. Hemodynamically significant APFs in
liver transplant recipients are rare, occurring in 0.2%; however, APFs (hemodynamically
significant or not) are not uncommonly seen in hepatic angiograms of liver transplant
recipients (up to 5.4% of hepatic arteriograms in transplants). Interestingly, hemody￾namically significant APFs warranting endovascular treatment are reported more
commonly in the literature in native compared with transplanted livers (n >280–300
versus n ¼ 13, respectively). This article discusses APFs that are specific to liver
transplant recipients; their incidence, etiology, pathogenesis, natural history, clinical
presentation, and endovascular management are discussed in detail.

APFs warranting endovascular treatment have been reported
more frequently in the literature in native (nontransplanted)
compared with transplanted livers (n >280–300 versus
n ¼ 13, respectively).1,8,9 This is despite the fact that liver
transplant recipients undergo numerous percutaneous pro￾cedures (liver biopsies and percutaneous transhepatic chol￾angiograms) and are under constant imaging surveillance.1–3
This may shed light as to the pathogenesis of hemodynami￾cally significant APFs.1–3,10
Etiology and Pathogenesis
APFs are considered arterial injuries leading to a connection
between the high-pressure hepatic artery and an adjacent
lower-pressure portal vein branch.1–3,8,11–15 APFs are be￾lieved to be a product of percutaneous transhepatic proce￾dures such as percutaneous liver biopsies and percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiograms (PTCs) with or without percu￾taneous biliary drain placement, hence the presumed etiolo￾gy of iatrogenic vascular injury.1–3,13–15 Of the 13 APFs in liver
transplants evaluated by Saad and coworkers, 11 (85%) had
clearly described prior biopsies (with or without PTCs),
averaging 103 days (range: 1–450 days) prior to the diagnosis
of biopsy-associated APFs.2,8,10,16–21 Eight of the 11 cases of
APFs (73%) had biopsies within 90 days from the APF diagno￾sis.2,8,10,16–21 Arterial injuries caused by percutaneous trans￾hepatic procedures have been classified into four types:
parenchymal contusions, active arterial bleeding, intrahe￾patic pseudoaneurysms, and arteriovenous fistulas.3,9,12–15
Over time, non-APF “acute” injuries (pseudoaneurysms, con￾tusions, active bleeding) either heal or lead to death. Thus
because of its enduring and insidious nature, the most
prevalent arterial injury is the APF. As a result, APFs represent
37%, 86%, and 100% of all arterial injuries immediately after,
1 week after, and 4 weeks after percutaneous biopsies,
respectively.12–14
Certain APFs close spontaneously, whereas others may
progress to large hemodynamically significant APFs.2,5–7,16,17
The pathogenesis of this is poorly understood and highly
speculative. However, the discrepancy between the incidence
of APFs in native versus transplanted livers has been a point of
discussion and speculation regarding the pathogenesis of
large hemodynamically significant APFs.1–3,10 It has been
surmised that the relatively compromised arterial flow and
the relative poor compliance of transplanted livers (stiff graft)
are a hindrance to the progression of APFs from small
hemodynamically insignificant APFs to those that are hemo￾dynamically significant.1–3
Clinical Presentation
Most APFs, hemodynamically significant or not, are asymp￾tomatic.1–3,8,12,13 In those that are symptomatic, APFs have
been the cause of portal hypertension (especially extrahepat￾ic and chronic central intrahepatic APFs), pain, sepsis, hemo￾bilia, biliary obstruction, and, rarely, pulmonary
hypertension.1–3,8,10,16–23 Unlike large arteriovenous fistulas
in the systemic circulation, hemodynamically significant APFs
have not been described as causing congestive heart failure.2,8
This is probably because the outflow in APFs is not systemic
and the “short-circuit” between the systemic arterial to the
systemic venous components is not present.2
In an analysis by Saad and coworkers,2 of 11 APFs clearly
described in detail in the literature, the most common
presentation for APFs (73% of cases) was a dysfunctional liver
transplant that had abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) only.
Another common presentation was gastrointestinal bleeding
(45%), with hemobilia as the most common type (27%). Pain
was also a common complaint that occurred in 36% of liver
transplant recipients with APFs.2 Hepatic graft dysfunction
and pain are a product of hemodynamically significant APFs;
however, bleeding can be caused by both large and small
APFs.2
Imaging Diagnosis
The gold standard imaging modality is to diagnose APF with
catheter-directed digital subtraction angiography (DSA).1–3
However, noninvasive imaging such as contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CT) or contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and Doppler ultrasound are impor￾tant preprocedural diagnostic modalities and posttreatment
follow-up modalities. Doppler ultrasound is particularly useful
because it is specific to hemodynamically significant APFs.1–3
Doppler Ultrasound
Doppler ultrasound may be the most important noninvasive
imaging modality for diagnosing and following APFs in liver
transplant recipients. In a study by Saad and coworkers,
Doppler was able to detect only 50% of APFs; however, it
detected all hemodynamically significant APFs.1 The advan￾tages of Doppler ultrasound are that it is noninvasive, the
main screening tool for all vascular complications in liver
transplants, and most importantly is the only noninvasive
imaging modality that can hemodynamically assess the he￾patic artery, portal vein, and APF.1–4 In fact, the definition of
hemodynamic significance is based on either Doppler ultra￾sound criteria or conventional angiography.1–3
Doppler ultrasound findings of APFs include visualizing a
focus of turbidity and aliasing at the site of the APFs
(►Fig. 1A), reduced arterial resistive indices (RIs) of the
feeding hepatic artery, and reversal of flow with or without
arterialization of venous flow in the receiving portal venous
branch (►Fig. 1B).1,3 A reduced arterial resistive index is
defined as either nominally low (<0.50) or an arterial RI that
is decreased from a prior Doppler baseline examination.1,3
Hemodynamic significance is defined by identifying the
portal venous findings in the main portal vein of the hepatic
graft or its first-order branch.1–3 If the graft is a whole hepatic
graft, the main portal vein is the main portal vein proper and
its first-order branch is the right or left portal vein. If the graft
is a split graft, the main portal vein of the graft is the right
portal vein with its first-order branches the right posterior or
anterior branch. Similarly, in a left lobe split graft, the main
portal branch is the left portal vein with its first-order
branches the segmental branches to Couinaud segments I,
II, or IV (if IV exists, and it usually does).1

Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography or
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Contrast-enhanced CT and/or contrast-enhanced MRI, with
or without angiography, probably are the most sensitive
noninvasive modalities in identifying all sizes of APFs. CT
and MRI, however, are usually not specific to borderline
hemodynamically significant APFs. Typically, on the arterial
phase of a CT or MR, the involved hepatic segment(s) (the
segment supplied by the “fistulized” portal vein branch)
demonstrates portovenous parenchymal enhancement that
is “ahead” and mistimed with the remainder of the liver
enhancement, which is still in the arterial phase of the
contrast enhancement (►Fig. 1C, 1D).1 A large abnormally
enhancing hepatic vascular territory usually indicates central
Figure 1 (A) Doppler ultrasound of the left hepatic lobe in a liver transplant recipient who is status post liver biopsy months earlier. There is a
focus of turbidity with aliasing (open arrow) with reversal of flow in the involved left portal vein branch (white arrow). (B) Doppler ultrasound with
spectral waveform analysis of the involved left portal vein branch, demonstrating reversal and arterialization of flow in the left portal vein (open
arrow). (C, D) Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial magnetic resonance (MR) images of the same patient as (B) and (C) in the arterial phase of the
enhancement. The images demonstrate the involved left hepatic lobe in a portal venous phase parenchymal of enhancement, which precedes the
remainder of the liver that is normal in its enhancement. The dashed arrows show the demarcation between the abnormally enhancing left lobe
and the normally enhancing right hepatic lobe. Also noted is a dilated left hepatic artery (solid white arrow) when compared with the right hepatic
artery (open white arrow) (D). (E, F) Two images in sequence of the initial diagnostic digitally subtracted angiogram demonstrating a portal vein
branch (solid arrow coursing adjacent to the feeding artery [open arrow] seen in the early arterial phase of the hepatic angiogram). By definition,
this is an arterioportal fistula (APF). The asterisk identifies the vicinity of the APF. (G) Two contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial MR images in the
arterial phase of the enhancement before (G-i) and after (G-ii) APF embolization. The images demonstrate that the abnormal left lobe
enhancement is out of phase (G-i) with the rest of the liver but becomes in phase with the rest of the liver after embolization (G-ii). The
demarcation seen in (G-i) (white arrows) is no longer visualized on the postembolization image. (H) Digitally subtracted angiogram through a
microcatheter (open black arrow) that has been placed into the feeding artery. Again seen is the early portal vein drainage (open white arrow). The
asterisk signifies the vicinity of the APF. (I) Digitally subtracted angiogram through a microcatheter after coil embolization of the main artery
(dashed arrows) supplying the APF (open arrow). Embolizing the main arterial supply and negating its sump effect has unmasked a smaller second
arterial branch (solid black arrows) that has fistulized with the same portal vein branch (asterisk). (J, K) Two digitally subtracted angiogram images
in two separate oblique projections better visualizing the smaller artery (solid black arrows) that fistulizes (asterisk) with the portal vein branch
(solid white arrows). Coils are seen in the embolized main arterial supply (open arrow). The operator at this point used polyvinyl alcohol to
embolize this small branch. (L) Two digitally subtracted angiograms of the same frame rate, same time after injection and same injection rate
before (L-i) and after embolization (open arrow, L-ii). The APF (asterisk, L-i) has been completely occluded (L-ii); the early portal vein branch (white
arrows) is no longer visualized. Notice that there is better filling of the hepatic artery due to the loss of the sump effect (steal effect) of the APF.

APFs but not necessarily large hemodynamically significant
APFs; having said that, central APFs have a higher likelihood of
developing into a hemodynamically significant APF. Occa￾sionally, a dilated feeding hepatic artery and/or a dilated
receiving/draining portal vein radical is visualized, signifying
a hemodynamically significant APF (►Fig. 1D).
Digital Subtraction Angiography
DSA is the gold standard examination for diagnosing APFs of
all sizes, as well as identifying hemodynamically significant
APFs.1–3 It is a very sensitive and specific modality for both.
Even the smallest APFs are defined as visualizing a portal vein
branch adjacent to a hepatic arterial branch in the early
arterial phase of the DSA.1–3 The fistulous tract does not
have to be seen, and in fact is rarely seen, to make the
diagnosis.1–3 Hemodynamically significant APFs are defined
as visualization/contrast filling of the main portal vein of the
graft or its first-order-branch.1–3
Postembolization Imaging Follow-up
Post-successful embolization imaging follow-up is performed
to evaluate for the reversal of signs of hemodynamic signifi￾cance. It should be primarily performed by Doppler ultra￾sound, which is the best noninvasive imaging modality to
assess and evaluate for the hemodynamic significance of
APFs.1–3 On follow-up imaging, one should notice reversal
of the portal venous Doppler ultrasound findings that signify
hemodynamic significance.1–3 By contrast-enhanced CT or
MR, the out-of-phase enhancement pattern of the involved
hepatic segment, described earlier, should return to a normal
enhancement pattern (►Fig. 1G).1
Management
Traditionally, only symptomatic APFs (e.g., causing ascites,
graft failure, bleeding) warrant treatment.1–3 However, with
the advent of minimally invasive endovascular therapy, with
its relative safety and effectiveness, asymptomatic but hemo￾dynamically significant APFs with hepatic graft dysfunction
(abnormal LFTs) have been treated. In addition, APFs that
show progressive enlargement have also been treated.1–3
Anecdotally, it is unfortunately not always easy to determine
definitively whether an APF is the cause of abnormal LFTs.
Abnormal LFTs/dysfunctional grafts are nonspecific, and em￾bolizing APFs may be a “diagnostic-therapeutic” approach to a
problem (i.e., “Fix it and see if that alleviates the dysfunc￾tion”). This approach, however, is still controversial, and APF
cases in transplants should be managed on a case-by-case
basis.
Surgical Management
The management of APFs historically is surgical, by ligation of
the involved hepatic artery segment, hepatic graft segmen￾tectomy, lobectomy, or even retransplantation.1,3,13,16,24,25
Being surgically minimalistic by performing intrahepatic
surgical ligation is actually not the simplest of surgeries; it
requires tedious methods of tissue dissection and vascular
reconstruction, and it may involve massive blood loss.23

Endovascular Management
There has been a paradigm shift in the last decade toward the
endovascular management of APFs in liver transplant recip￾ients.8,10,16–22 This was attributed by Saad and coworkers to
the inadequate and invasive surgical techniques due to the
(usually) deeply located APFs within the hepatic parenchyma
that cause major blood loss or result in a significant size
segmentectomy.2 However, endovascular management (al￾most always with embolization) is also difficult and not
without risk.2
Endovascular management of APFs in transplant recipients
is riskier than endovascular management of APFs in native
(nontransplanted) livers. This is because the hepatic graft is a
far less forgiving organ than a native liver in terms of hepatic
arterial supply, and it is particularly susceptible to ische￾mia.1–3,26 Any hepatic artery thrombosis as a compli￾cation of embolization may have devastating
consequences.1–3 Furthermore, the fistulous tract is very
short and often not precisely visualized, and thus the embo￾lization is actually of the more proximal feeding artery; this
results in a much larger potential zone of ischemia. The larger
the APF and the larger and more central the feeding artery, the
higher the risk that a successful embolization of the feeding
artery will also devascularize a large territory of hepatic graft
parenchyma from the arterial flow.1 This is the reason why
some authors advocate treating rapidly growing asymptom￾atic APFs before they grow to an extent where larger arterial
branches are required to be embolized.1 It is not uncommon
(15% of APF cases) to find progression of the hemodynamic
significance of APFs over 2 to 9 months.2,20 Regarding growth
and centrality of APFs, endovascular embolization procedures
have been classified as either low ischemic risk procedures
(small peripheral feeding vessels that can be sacrificed with
minimal collateral devascularization) and high ischemic risk
procedures (larger more central feeding vessels that when
sacrificed will have significant collateral devascularization
due to a large vascular territory that has been embolized).2
Embolization of APFs are now typically performed with
microcatheters and microcoil techniques in an attempt to be
as superselective as possible. As mentioned earlier, the fistu￾lous tract is usually not definitively visualized, and the aim is
usually to embolize the feeding artery as close to the APF as
possible (►Fig. 1H, 1I). The angiographic end point is neither
pristine angiographic images nor complete obliteration of the
APF. The successful end point is a reduction of the APF from
hemodynamically significant to hemodynamically insignifi￾cant.1–3 As a result, not uncommonly (20 to 25% of APFs) may
require more than one session for adequate embolization/
obliteration of the APF.2 In fact, some authors are content
with partial embolization as long as the portal venous find￾ings of hemodynamic significance are alleviated by follow-up
Doppler ultrasound.1
Particulate embolization with polyvinyl alcohol and even
Gelfoam (Upjohn, Inc., Kalamazoo, MI) may be helpful in
reaching the desired end point (►Fig. 1I–K). An interesting
angiographic finding is the phenomenon of having multiple
feeding arteries, seen in up to 20 to 25% of APF cases in liver
transplants, which has led some authors to dub these cases
“complex APFs.”
1,3 Unfortunately, not all APF fistulas present
themselves on the initial DSA. Similar to embolizing an
arteriovenous malformation, embolizing the main feeding
artery may unmask and expose the secondary feeding vessels
(►Fig. 1I–K). For this reason, it is important that operators
perform a less selective hepatic angiogram after initial em￾bolization to identify additional secondary feeders/APFs
(►Fig. 1L).
Endovascular management of APF overall is safe and
effective.2 Approximately 20 to 25% of cases require more
than one session to reach the desired effect/hemodynamic
end point.2 The overall technical success rate is 63 to 77%,
with an anticipated complication rate of 12 to 15%. However,
the intent-to-treat graft survival at 6 months has been
reported to be up to 36%.2
Conclusion
APFs in liver transplants are not uncommon; however, most
are incidentally noted and of questionable significance;
hemodynamically significant APFs are rare, occurring in
0.2% of transplants. Doppler ultrasound and digital subtrac￾tion angiography are the two modalities that can define
hemodynamic significance. It remains controversial whether
to treat asymptomatic APFs, although treatment is performed
for patients with abnormal LFTs in the presence of a hemo￾dynamically significant APF. Endovascular therapy is safe and
effective, and now considered the treatment of choice.
