arsenic had been selected in that they were all early and
frankly active cases with an E.S.R. of over 40 mm. in one
hour. The remaining groups included patients over 50 years
of age and with advanced disease.
Table II shows the results adjusted by the removal of such
patients from each group. The figures in this small series
indicate that the results of a single course of treatment with
gold salts are no better than those obtained by the other
methods described.

A series of 220 patients have been treated by a variety
of measures, 38 of them receiving gold. No appreciable
difference in the results has been found, either immedi￾ately or after one year.

Miss Patricia Hornsby-Smith, M.P., Parliamentary Secre￾tary to the Ministry of Health, was the guest speaker at the
annual general meeting of the Central Council for the Care
of Cripples, which took place on April 10. She said she
sympathized very much with the point of view of the council
on the edict of the General Nursing Council preventing
nurses from starting their training until they are 18, and
thus eliminating the year of orthopaedic pre-nursing which
many girls of 17 had been doing, but she hoped that some
compromise might yet be reached in this matter. The Minis￾try of Health readily acknowledged and appreciated the
voluntary work which the council was doing, and was glad
to support the project being launched for the sale of goods
made by cripples. A committee was being set up by the
Ministry to inquire into the rehabilitation and training of
all those physically handicapped. Miss Hornsby-Smith said
that, following a circular to 129 local authorities asking
them to submit schemes for the care of their physically dis￾abled, 65 had already submitted schemes to the Minister.
She thought local authorities had a difficult task in deciding
which service to expand and which to create without￾increasinrg the rates.
DISSEMINATED ASPERGIHLOSIS
AND MONILIASIS ASSOCIATED WITH
AGRANULOCYTOSIS AND
ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY
BY
N. E. RANKIN, M.B., B.S.
(From the Department of Pathology, the Royal Infirmary,
Gloucester)
Pulmonary aspergillosis and local infections with
monilia are not rare, but the disseminated forms are
much less common. The use of antibiotics in the
presence of these fungous infections is dangerous. The
following case is of interest because both fungi were
present in the lesions.
Case Report
A window cleaner aged 45 was seen on April 3, 1951,
with an abscess of the thigh. He was treated with sulphon￾amides, and was admitted on April 18 for evacuation of the
pus (culture, Staphylococcus aureus). He later developed
consolidation of the right lung. This was treated with
penicillin, 14 million units, and resolved slowly. Albumin￾uria developed on May 28 and persisted. The white-cell
counts on April 26 and July 26 were 4,600 and 4,300 per
c.mm., respectively. He was discharged on August 31, and
shortly afterwards developed ulceration of the throat, which
responded to chloramphenicol. He was readmitted on
October 5 and agranulocytosis was found (white cells 1,800,
polymorphonuclears 108 per c.mm.), and this persisted.
Chloramphenicol was continued (total dose, 30 g.), with oral
and intramuscular penicillin. Pyridoxine, 250 mg., " livadex "
20 ml., and three blood transfusions of 1 pint (570 ml.) were
given. Consolidation of both lungs developed on November
1 (sputum culture, Ps. pyocyanea) and he died on Novem￾ber 7.
At necropsy on November 8 fibrinous pleurisy was pre￾sent on both sides. A large infarct was found in the right
upper lobe and a smaller infarct in the middle lobe; the
pulmonary arteries to these areas showed thrombosis. In
the left upper lobe was a pale area of consolidation 6 cm.
in diameter, but no cavitation. A typical red infarct was
present in the left kidney, and both kidneys showed several
smaller dark-red areas in the cortex. The liver was en￾larged (3,500 g.),. pale, and firm, with numerous firm white
nodules up to 1.5 cm. in diameter with some hyperaemia at
the edges. There were a few similar areas in the spleen.
The oesophagus was covered throughout with a ragged soft
membranous exudate covering shallow ulcers. There was
one small acute ulcer in the stomach. In the duodenum and
jejunum there were numerous ulcers up to 1 cm. in diameter
with a yellowish base and raised haemorrhagic border. A
few ulcers were found in the ileum and one in the caecum.
Red marrow was present in the sternum and vertebral bodies.
Exploration of the left thigh showed fibrosis at the site of the
abscess, but no pus or involvement of the femur.
Sections of the lesion in the left lung showed a central
area of necrosis, in which only the outlines of the blood
vessels could be distinguished. Surrounding this was a zone
of inflammatory infiltration in which plasma cells and
macrophages predominated. No polymorphonuclears or
eosinophils could be seen. Branching mycelium was pre￾sent throughout the necrotic zone, invading the inflamma￾tory zone and large and small vessels at the edge. The left
lung showed a typical infarct with mycelium in the thrombi.
The kidney contained an infarct with mycelium in the lumen
of the artery. Sections of liver and spleen revealed areas
of necrosis similar to that in the rung, but with a very dense
network of mycelium, which extended on to the peritoneal
surface of the liver. The ulcers in the alimentary tract
showed necrotic centres surrounded by the inflammatory
reaction, and invasion of the muscularis and blood vessels
by mycelium.

APRIL 25, 1953 DISSEMINATED ASPERGILLOSIS AND MONILIASIS BRTs 919 MiDiCAL JOURNAL
Dr. J. T. Duncan kindly examined the sections and made
the following comments on the morphology of the fungi.
" The tissue sections showed infection by two different
fungi, neither of which can be identified specifically without
a culture. One of the fungi shows a coarse septate mycelium
bearing tufts of stunted terminal branches, indistinguishable
from the vegetative mycelium of Aspergillus fumigatus in
parasitic life, yet not sufficiently distinctive to be identified
with this species in the absence of conidial apparatus. This
was the only fungus seen in the lung and kidney sections,
but it was present also in other tissues, often within the
blood vessels. In fact, like A. fumigatus, it seemed to have
a marked predilection for the blood vessels, and this
accounts for the renal infarct. I would judge that this
mould infection originated in the lung and was carried to
other organs by the blood stream. The other fungus, which
was seen in all of the tissues except the lung and kidney,
showed general morphology of Candida, which is particu￾larly well shown in the sections of liver and spleen. In
many of the tissues both fungi are present, and in some areas
they are intimately mixed. However, the Candida infection
is chiefly associated with the mucosa of the alimentary
tract."
Discussion
Disseminated aspergillosis is often associated with in￾farcts, especially in the kidney (Wahl and Erickson, 1928;
Abbott et al., 1952; Dr. H. G. Close, personal communica￾tion). Very widespread dissemination has been described
(Cawley, 1947; Grekin et al., 1950), as have two cases of
endocarditis (Zimmerman, 1950). Infection of the mouth
and alimentary tract with monilia is a common complication
of agranulocytosis. Several cases of disseminated infection
have been described. The portal of entry may be the ali￾mentary tract, as in the present case and in those of Lederer
and Todd (1949). Duhig and Mead (1951) discussed the
possibility of introduction into the blood stream during in￾travenous therapy. This probably occurred in the cases
described by Joachim and Polayes (1940) and Wikler et al.
(1942) in drug addicts, and by Geiger et al. (1945). The bac￾terial flora of the alimentary tract is known to change dur￾ing antibiotic therapy, and fungi often appear (Tomaszewski,
1951) owing to suppression of the normal flora and other
factors. It is probable that in the present case dissemination
of the fungi was promoted by chloramphenicol therapy.
The association of agranulocytosis with chloramphenicol
was not well known at the time this patient was treated.
Summary
A case of fatal generalized aspergillosis and monili￾asis is described. The patient's illness started with a
staphylococcal abscess in the thigh, followed by pyaemia
with lung lesions. He later developed agranulocytosis
and was treated with chloramphenicol. Recent reports
indicate the danger of this drug in agranulocytosis.
Aspergillosis and moniliasis were found at necropsy.
Reference is made to other cases of generalized fungous
infections in the literature.
I wish to thank Mr. P. M. Birks and Dr. R. F. Jarrett for
permission to publish this case; Dr. E. N. Davey for his advice
in preparing this paper; and Dr. H. G. Close, of Dartford, for
allowing me to examine material from his case. Dr. J. T.
Duncan's help and advice on the mycology have been invaluable.
I am grateful to Miss B. Summers for the histological
preparations.

Medical Memoranda
Monilia Peritonitis
Powerful wide-spectrum antibiotics will suppress the growth
of susceptible bacteria, and these may be replaced by monilia
or other yeast-like organisms which can in certain situations
become pathogenic. Oral and intestinal lesions are well
recognized (Woods et al., 1951), and cases of monilia pneu￾monia (Ormerod and Friedmann, 1951; Wolff, 1952) and
moniliasis of the urinary tract (Taylor and Rundle, 1952)
have been reported in patients treated with aureomycin or
chloramphenicol. So far as we know monilia peritonitis
has not hitherto been reported.
CASE REPORT
A man aged 49 was admitted to hospital with foot-drop,
fever, and abdominal pain. While in hospital the fever
continued, wrist-drop developed, and signs of active carditis
appeared. The usual investigations of a pyrexia of un￾known origin were negative, and in spite of parenteral
penicillin the patient deteriorated and developed broncho￾pneumonia. He was thought to be suffering from poly￾arteritis nodosa, and, although he was known to have a
duodenal ulcer, it was decided that he should be treated
with 100 mg. of A.C.T.H. and 2 g. of aureomycin daily.
After three days on this regimen he complained of severe
abdominal pain and his abdomen became distended with
fluid. He was judged unfit for surgical intervention and
60 oz. (1.7 litres) of brownish viscid fluid was aspirated from
the peritoneal cavity. The A.C.T.H. was stopped, the
stomach aspirated, and an intravenous drip of glucose￾saline begun together with intravenous terramycin. Three
days later a further paracentesis was necessary and 100 oz.
(2.8 litres) of very viscous fluid was withdrawn.
Large numbers of monilia were found on direct exami￾nation of the fluid, with pus cells but no other organisms,
and a pure growth of Candida albicans was obtained on
culture. Gentian violet, 1 g., was given daily by intra￾peritoneal injection, but fluid continued to reaccumulate and
the patient went downhill and died after a further four days.
At necropsy 3 litres of fluid was found in the peritoneal
cavity, the viscera were coated with fibrino-purulent material,
and there was a large perforated ulcer in the first part of the
duodenum.
COMMENT
The aureomycin must have altered the patient's intestinal
flora until C. albicans was the dominant organism, and when
the ulcer perforated as a complication of treatment with
A.C.T.H. it was this organism which obtained access to
the peritoneal cavity and set up infection. Powerful new
remedies of necessity bring with them new complications,
and it is important that these should be recorded, as, with
the increasing use of these agents, similar cases are to be
expected in the future.

findings and to Professor L. J. Witts for permission to publish this
report.
