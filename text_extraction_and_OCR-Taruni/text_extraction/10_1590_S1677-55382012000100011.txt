INTRODUCTION
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is 
a disease of the proximal ureter resulting from both 
congenital and acquired causes. Open pyeloplasty 
remains the comparative gold standard for 
treatment (1-3). As an attempt to decrease associated 
morbidity of an open procedure, less invasive 
endoscopic techniques such as endopyelotomy 
were developed, but long-term outcomes were not 
as good as expected (4-6). Success of laparoscopic 
pyeloplasty is equivalent (7,8); however, due to its 
technical complexity, many urologists still perform 
a significant number of open and endoscopic 
Introduction: Robotic Pyeloplasty (RAP) is a technique for management of uretero￾pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO).
Purpose: To report outcomes of RAP for primary and secondary (after failed pri￾mary treatment) UPJO.
Materials and Methods: Single institution data of adult RAP performed from 2007 
to 2009 was collected retrospectively following approval by our IRB. Database 
analysis included patient age, race, pre and post-operative imaging studies and 
perioperative variables including operative time, blood loss, pain and complica￾tions.
Results: Fifty-five adult patients underwent RAP (26 left/29 right) for UPJO includ￾ing 9 secondary procedures from 2007 to 2009. Average follow-up was 16 months 
(1-36). Mean age was 41 years (18-71) with an average BMI of 27 (17-42); 32 were 
female. Most patients were diagnosed with preoperative diuretic renal scintigraphy 
and the obstructed side demonstrated mean function of 41% and t1/2 of 70 min￾utes. Mean operative time was 194 minutes with average blood loss less than 100 
mL. Mean hospital stay was 1.7 days with an average narcotic equivalent dose of 
15 mg. RAP for secondary UPJO took longer with more blood loss and had a lower 
success rate. Failure was defined as the need of another procedure due to persis￾tent pain and/or obstruction after diuretic renal imaging. One patient (2%) with 
primary UPJO failed and 2 patients (22%) with secondary UPJO failed. One major 
complication occurred.
Conclusion: RAP is a good option for the treatment of patients with UPJO. Reported 
series have established that endopyelotomy has inferior success rate for the treat￾ment of primary UPJO which compromises the success of subsequent treatment as 
demonstrated in our higher failure rate with secondary UPJO repair.

procedures (9). This trend is rapidly changing as 
more surgeons become familiar with laparoscopic 
techniques and the rapid advancement of the 
robotic platform has eased the transition of the open 
surgeon into the era of minimally invasive surgery. 
We report our institutional outcomes of robotic￾assisted pyeloplasty (RAP) for primary and secondary 
UPJO with the goal of contributing further evidence 
supporting RAP for primary UPJO repair.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Medical records were retrospectively re￾viewed on all patients treated with RAP for UPJO 
at our institution from 2007 to 2009. Patient age, 
race, UPJO characteristics including pre-operative 
imaging, operative statistics (time, blood loss, 
complication), and post-operative follow-up in￾formation were recorded. Differentiation between 
primary and secondary repairs was made and in￾cluded in final analysis. All patients were identi￾fied as having UPJO based on presenting symp￾toms and renal imaging, most often with nuclear 
diuretic renal scan (40 patients, 72%). UPJO was 
defined as clinically significant when obstruc￾tive hydronephrosis with diuretic renal scan was 
demonstrated t1/2 > 20 minutes. Renal anatomy, 
size of hydronephrosis and presence of crossing 
vessels was evaluated with contrasted CT imag￾ing. Pre-operative ureteral stenting or nephros￾tomy tube placement was not routinely performed 
unless for specific clinical reasons such as pain 
control.
All procedures were performed by 2 ex￾perienced laparoscopic (RSF, SBB) surgeons using 
Intuitive Surgical DaVinci S/Si system®. A stan￾dard 3-arm technique was used with an addition￾al assistant port. All procedures were performed 
transperitoneally. Dismembered pyeloplasty was 
performed in all cases with transposition of cross￾ing vessels when present. Ureteral stent, typically 
positioned antegrade via the assistant port, was 
placed and confirmed in correct location with 
post-operative plain abdominal radiograph. Con￾tinuous bladder drainage via Foley catheter was 
maintained for 24-48 hours. Post-operative pain 
was managed with a combination of intravenous 
Ketorolac, narcotics and transitioned to oral med￾ications once diet was advanced. Surgical drains, 
when placed, were removed prior to discharge 
unless high outputs were observed and/or fluid 
creatitine levels were greater than serum. Ureteral 
stents were removed after 3 weeks. Follow-up di￾uretic renal imaging was typically performed at 8 
weeks.
RESULTS
55 adult patients underwent RAP (26 left/29 
right) for UPJO including 9 secondary procedures 
from 2007 to 2009. Table-1 displays the cohort 
demographics. Average follow up was 16 months 
(1-36). Mean age was 41 years (18-71) with an 
average BMI of 27 (17-42); 32 were female. Most 
cases were diagnosed with preoperative diuretic 
renal scan (40 patients, 72%) with obstructed side 
demonstrating mean function of 41% and t1/2 of 
70 minutes (Table-2). Mean operative time was 
194 minutes with average blood loss less than 
100 mL. Mean hospital stay was 1.7 days with 
an average narcotic equivalent dose of 15 mg. 
On average, RAP for secondary UPJO took longer 
with more blood loss and had a lower success 
rate (Table-3). Failure was defined as the need of 
another procedure due to persistent pain and/or 
obstruction on follow-up diuretic renal imaging. 
One patient (2%) with primary UPJO failed and 2 
patients (22%) with secondary UPJO failed. One 
operative complication occurred secondary to 
trocar injury of the liver, requiring conversion to

DISCUSSION
Treatment of UPJO remains an evolving 
process with the advancement of surgical technol￾ogy. The comparative gold standard for successful 
treatment is open pyeloplasty, first performed in 
1891 by Kuster (10). The demands of minimizing 
morbidity, faster convalescence, and shorter hos￾pital stay have led to adoption and development 
of other procedures. In the 1980’s, antegrade and 
then retrograde endopyelotomy was introduced 
along with the development of flexible ureteros￾copy. Because these treatment options were less 
invasive and less morbid compared to open py￾eloplasty, endoscopic procedures soon became the 
primary treatment of UPJO with open pyeloplasty 
being reserved for failed primary management.

early 1990’s, surgical correction of UPJO again 
changed when the first laparoscopic pyeloplasty 
was reported in 1993 (7). Further advancement 
was made with the incorporation of the robotic 
platform in 2000 (11).
RAP has outcomes similar to laparoscopic 
or open pyeloplasty for primary UPJO (12-15, Ta￾ble-4). The long term results of Anderson-Hynes 
open pyeloplasty are greater that 95% over about 
10 years follow-up (2,12) which is comparable to 
the long term results for laparoscopic pyeloplasty. 
In the largest laparoscopic pyeloplasty series of 
147 patients published, the success rate was 95% 
with average 24-month follow-up (13). While no 
side-by-side comparison between robotic pyelo￾plasty to open pyeloplasty has been made, mul￾tiple studies evaluating robotic and laparoscopic 
pyeloplasty are available (Table-4). A meta-anal￾ysis of 8 studies that compared laparoscopic to 
robotic pyeloplasty revealed a significantly short￾er hospital stay in RAP by ½ day, with no signifi￾cant difference in operative time, rates of com￾plications, re-admission rates, or success rates 
(14). In a single surgeon study from India that 
compared 30 RAP cases to 30 laparoscopic pyelo￾plasty cases, differences in operative time, blood 
loss and hospital stay were observed in favor of 
RAP. The success rates however were comparable 
(100% laparoscopic pyeloplasty, 96.7% in RAP) 
(15). Overall, robotic pyeloplasty shows a similar 
success rate compared to open and laparoscopic 
pyeloplasty while it may provide advantage in 
length of hospitalization and ease of surgery.
Table-5 lists the largest endopyelotomy 
series reported in the literature. A retrospective

review by Yanke et al. (16) evaluating RAP, retro￾grade endopyelotomy and laparoscopic pyeloplas￾ty with a mean follow-up of 20 months showed a 
success rate of 60.2% of the retrograde endopy￾elotomy group, 88.2% for laparoscopic pyeloplas￾ty, and 100% for RAP. Recurrence free survival 
for endopyelotomy was 50% at 7 years compared 
with 76% for laparoscopic pyeloplasty. Follow-up 
for RAP is currently in the beginning, however, it 
is assumed that RAP will likely mimic or may be 
better than the success rate of laparoscopic py￾eloplasty over long-term. A retrospective review 
from Mayo Clinic (17) comparing antegrade en￾dopyelotomy and pyeloplasty also showed similar 
findings. Endopyelotomy was found to be signifi￾cantly inferior to pyeloplasty after 3, 5, and 10 
years. The presence of extrinsic obstruction such 
as a crossing vessel or high grade hydronephrosis 
does not affect the outcome of operative pyelo￾plasty performed laparoscopic or with robot assis￾tance (18). However, endopyelotomy success rates 
decreases significantly in the presence of these 
variables (18,19). Therefore, while pyeloplasty 
may be universally applied, endopyelotomy can 
only be safely and efficaciously used in very lim￾ited scenarios and even then the overall success 
rates are not durable.
The primary purpose of this study is to 
report outcomes of RAP and endorse its role for 
treatment of primary UPJO. Operative time, blood 
loss and complication rates are similar to larger se￾ries in the literature (20). As for patient outcomes,

while our overall success rate for primary UPJO 
are representative of what is reported in literature, 
our success rate for secondary UPJO is not. The 
overall success rate for our cohort is 95%; 98% 
for primary and 78% for secondary UPJO. Most 
of the RAP series indicate an overall success rate 
between 89-100% (20). Muffarrij et al. reported 
an overall success rate of 95.7% (96.6% in pri￾mary, and 91.3% in the secondary) (21). Similar 
results were observed in the series by Schwenter 
(22). Although many studies do indicate the high 
overall success rates, not many studies report the 
success rate for RAP in secondary UPJO, and none 
analyze these systematically. However, those that 
report them do indicate a trend towards a decrease 
in success rates in the secondary UPJO. Our low 
success rate in secondary UPJO could also be due 
to low sample size.
Endopyelotomy is an inferior treatment 
for the vast majority of primary UPJO due to lower 
success rates and consequently will compromise 
the success of subsequent treatments. Endoscopic 
management can be useful as a secondary proce￾dure following pyeloplasty as multiple retrospec￾tive studies have demonstrated some success. Hoe￾nig et al. demonstrated that endopyelotomy after 
failed open pyeloplasty was successful in 71% of 
cases. However, following primary endopyeloto￾my, endoscopic salvage is unlikely to relieve ob￾struction with success rate of 37.5% (23). Open 
repair for secondary obstruction demonstrates 
greater success with rates reported as high as 95% 
(24). As for laparoscopic pyeloplasty for second￾ary UPJ obstruction after failed endopyelotomy, 
Sundaram reported an overall success rate of 83% 
with higher complication rate and longer opera￾tive time (25). This is similar to our outcomes for 
secondary repairs. Overall, laparoscopic pyelo￾plasty/RAP for secondary UPJO after failed en￾dopyelotomy shows a poor overall success rate, 
increased complication rate, and increased operat￾ing time.
RAP is minimally invasive with a de￾creased length of hospitalization and faster con￾valescence as compared to open pyeloplasty. 
While laparoscopic pyeloplasty is an excellent al￾ternative to open surgery, the drawback is a steep 
learning curve, and the difficultly with intracor￾poreal suturing (26). This limitation precludes its 
widespread use. In a contemporary survey study 
looking at current practice patterns of primary 
UPJO, 78% of urologists in community practice 
stated they prefer an open approach while 67% 
of academic urologists stated that they prefer a 
laparoscopic approach (27). RAP has a potentially 
shorter learning curve (28) and may enable lapa￾roscopic-naive urologist to perform the procedure 
easily, bridging the gap between academic and 
community urologists. Therefore, we endorse RAP 
as the procedure of choice for primary UJPO re￾serving endopyelotomy for secondary procedures.
CONCLUSIONS
RAP is a good option for the treatment of 
patients with primary UPJO. Reported series have 
established that endopyelotomy has an inferior suc￾cess rate for the treatment of primary UPJO which 
compromises the success of subsequent treatment 
as demonstrated by our higher failure rate with 
secondary UPJO repair.
