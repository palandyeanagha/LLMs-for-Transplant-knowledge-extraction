In humans, the biological limitations to cardiac regenerative growth create both a clinical imperative — to offset cell 
death in acute ischemic injury and chronic heart failure — and a clinical opportunity; that is, for using cells, genes, 
and proteins to rescue cardiac muscle cell number or in other ways promote more efficacious cardiac repair. Recent 
experimental studies and early-phase clinical trials lend credence to the visionary goal of enhancing cardiac repair 
as an achievable therapeutic target.
Heart failure — a severe deficiency in ventricular pump function 
— arises through a finite number of terminal effector mecha￾nisms, regardless of the cause. These include: defects intrinsic 
to cardiac muscle cells’ contractility due to altered expression 
or operation of calcium-cycling proteins, components of the 
sarcomere, and enzymes for cardiac energy production; defects 
extrinsic to cardiac muscle cells, such as interstitial fibrosis, 
affecting organ-level compliance; and myocyte loss, unmatched 
by myocyte replacement. Cardiac regeneration is robust for cer￾tain organisms such as the newt and zebrafish, in which total 
replacement can transpire even for an amputated limb, fin, or 
tail, via production of an undifferentiated cell mass called the 
blastema (1). Such a degree of restorative growth might also be 
dependent on the retention of proliferative potential in a sub￾set of adult cardiomyocytes (2) and is impossible in mammals 
under normal, unassisted biological circumstances. Several 
complementary strategies can be foreseen as potentially aiding 
this process: overriding cell-cycle checkpoints that constrain the 
reactive proliferation of ventricular myocytes (3); supplementing 
the cytoprotective mechanisms that occur naturally, or inhibit￾ing pro-death pathways (4, 5); supplementing the angiogenic 
mechanisms that occur naturally using defined growth factors 
or vessel-forming cells (6, 7); or providing exogenous cells as a 
surrogate or precursor for cardiac muscle itself (8–10).
Among these conceptual possibilities, cell implantation in vari￾ous forms has been the first strategy to be translated from bench 
to bedside. The possibility of tissue repair by autologous adult 
progenitor cells — suggested by the auspicious findings in experi￾mental studies of various cell sources — immediately captured the 
attention of clinicians confronted with the disabling, life-threaten￾ing circumstance of patients who suffer from heart failure in acute 
or chronic ischemic heart disease. The promise of cellular cardio￾myogenesis and neovascularization, individually or in tandem, 
offered altogether novel opportunities for treatment, tailored to 
the underlying pathobiology.
Within just the past 3 years, more than a half-dozen early clini￾cal studies have been published, ranging from case reports to for￾mal trials, deploying a range of differing cell-based therapies with 
the shared objective of improving cardiac repair (11–16). Clinical 
follow-up for as long as a year is now available for some patients 
(17, 18). Despite their different strategies and cells, and lack of 
double-blinded controls, these small initial human trials in gen￾eral point to a functional improvement; yet key questions remain 
open. Understanding better just why and how grafting works will 
be essential, alongside needed empirical trials, to engineer the 
soundest future for regenerative therapy in human heart disease.
The inauguration of human cardiac repair
Ventricular dysfunction is the sine qua non of heart failure. 
Conventional palliative medical management does not correct, 
or attempt to correct, underlying defects in cardiac muscle cell 
number. Moreover, while indispensable to current treatment of 
end-stage heart failure, more aggressive interventions such as car￾diac transplantation and the use of mechanical LV assist devices 
(either as a bridge to transplantation or as “destination” therapy) 
are thwarted by comorbidity or finite effectiveness, inciting the 
search for more advanced methods (19, 20). This need for caus￾ally directed treatment — to complement mere support of the 
remaining healthy myocardium — has prompted the translation 
of a decade’s experimental studies into clinical pilot trials studying 
cell-based myocardial regeneration and repair.
Cell types
Currently, a variety of adult progenitor cells are undergoing clini￾cal evaluation — all autologous, so that tissue rejection is obviated 
(Figure 1). The first clinically relevant cells to be proposed as a sur￾rogate for cardiomyocytes were skeletal muscle myoblasts — undif￾ferentiated proliferation-competent cells that serve as precursors 
to skeletal muscle (21–23). For clinical use, autologous human 
myoblasts are isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies, propagated 
and expanded ex vivo for a few days or weeks, then injected directly 
into the ventricular wall (11, 24, 25).
Bone marrow is, at present, the most frequent source of cells 
used for clinical cardiac repair (12–14, 16). Bone marrow contains 
a complex assortment of progenitor cells, including HSCs; so￾called side population (SP) cells, defined by their ability to expel 
a Hoechst dye, which account for most if not all long-term self￾renewal (26, 27) and reconstitute the full panoply of hematopoietic

lineages after single-cell grafting (28); 
mesenchymal stem cells or stromal cells 
(29); and multipotential adult progenitor 
cells (MAPCs), a subset of mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) (30). Bone marrow is aspi￾rated under local or general anesthesia, the 
entire mononuclear cell fraction is obtained 
(a heterogeneous mix of the above-men￾tioned cells), or specific subpopulations 
are purified, and isolated cells are injected 
into the heart without need of further ex 
vivo expansion. Expansion in cell culture 
could be desirable or essential, though, if 
defined but minute subpopulations prove 
to be advantageous (30).
Last, peripheral blood–derived progenitor 
cells are used both for clinical cardiac repair 
(13) and for neovascularization in periph￾eral arterial occlusive disease (7). These cir￾culating cells (endothelial progenitor cells 
[EPCs]) are bone marrow derived (31), and, 
historically, therapeutic angiogenesis is the 
objective of virtually all clinical studies using 
bone marrow or its circulating derivatives 
for ischemic myocardium. For clinical use, 
EPCs are isolated from mononuclear blood 
cells and selected ex vivo by culturing in 
“endothelium-specific” medium for 3 days, 
prior to reinjection into the heart. The added 
hypothesis that such cells also might trans￾differentiate to create new cardiomyocytes 
(32) is unrelated to the clinical studies’ origin 
and dispensable to their rationale. Critiques 
of the clinical studies — where based on the 
absence or paucity of myocyte formation in 
mice (33–35) — raise useful questions as to 
the mechanisms for success (as measured to 
date by improvements in ventricular pump 
function), but overlook this most salient 
point, namely, the actual rationale.

multipotent cells from other sources, and novel 
progenitor or stem cells discovered in the adult 
myocardium; see text for details. (B) Existing 
trials use intracoronary delivery routes (over￾the-wire balloon catheters), intramuscular 
delivery via catheters (e.g., the NOGA system 
for electromechanical mapping), or direct injec￾tion during cardiac surgery. Not represented 
here are the theoretical potential for systemic 
delivery, suggested by the homing of some cell 
types to infarcted myocardium (39), and strate￾gies to mobilize endogenous cells from other 
tissue sites to the heart.

On the horizon of being tested for potential clinical application 
are other progenitor/stem cell populations: fat tissue–derived 
multipotent stem cells (36); multipotential cells from bone mar￾row or skeletal muscle (minuscule subpopulations, distinct from 
the unfractionated bone marrow and the myoblasts used in cur￾rent trials) (30, 37); somatic stem cells from placental cord blood 
(38); and cardiac-resident progenitor cells that have a heightened 
predisposition to adopt the cardiac muscle fate (39–43). In each 
of these newer cases, techniques to isolate and purify the numeri￾cally minor population of potent cells will need to be optimized 
for clinical use, and enabling data from mammals larger than the 
mouse will surely be warranted. 
Routes of application
Thus far, progenitor cells for cardiac repair have been delivered in 
3 ways: via an intracoronary arterial route or by injection of the 
ventricular wall via a percutaneous endocardial or surgical epicar￾dial approach (Figure 1). The advantage of intracoronary infusion 
— using standard balloon catheters — is that cells can travel directly 
into myocardial regions in which nutrient blood flow and oxygen 
supply are preserved, which hence ensures a favorable environment 
for cells’ survival, a prerequisite for stable engraftment. Conversely, 
homing of intra-arterially applied progenitor cells requires migra￾tion out of the vessel into the surrounding tissue, so that unper￾fused regions of the myocardium are targeted far less efficiently, if 
at all. Moreover, whereas bone marrow–derived and blood-derived 
progenitor cells are known to extravasate and migrate to ischemic 
areas (44), skeletal myoblasts do not and furthermore may even 
obstruct the microcirculation after intra-arterial administration, 
leading to embolic myocardial damage.
By contrast, direct delivery of progenitor cells into scar tissue or 
areas of hibernating myocardium by catheter-based needle injec￾tion, direct injection during open-heart surgery, and minimally 
invasive thoracoscopic procedures are not limited by cell uptake 
from the circulation or by embolic risk. An offsetting consider￾ation is the risk of ventricular perforation, which may limit the 
use of direct needle injection into freshly infarcted hearts. In addi￾tion, it is hard to envisage that progenitor cells injected into uni￾formly necrotic tissue — lacking the syncytium of live muscle cells 
that may furnish instructive signals and lacking blood flow for 
the delivery of oxygen and nutrients — would receive the necessary 
cues and environment to engraft and differentiate. Most cells, if 
injected directly, simply die (45). For this reason, electromechani￾cal mapping of viable but “hibernating” myocardium may be use￾ful to pinpoint the preferred regions for injection (14). Finally, 
in diffuse diseases such as dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, 
focal deposits of directly injected cells might be poorly matched to 
the underlying anatomy and physiology.
Thus, it already appears likely that patients’ individual patho￾biology — the specific underpinnings of their heart failure — will 
ultimately influence, if not dictate, the source and route chosen 
among potential progenitor cell therapies. Given such variations in 
the underlying clinical context, it is not yet possible on the basis of 
existing pilot clinical trials, whose design and findings are detailed 
below, to assert an “optimal” cell type or “best” mode of delivery.
Initial clinical results, 2000–2004
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the results of all clinical trials studying 
cell-based myocardial repair published to date. It is vital to dis￾tinguish between those investigations performed on patients with 
acute myocardial infarction (Table 1) and those on patients with 
chronic heart failure due to prior myocardial infarction (Table 2), 
not only because of the different cell types and modes of delivery 
used, but also because fundamentally different pathophysiological 
processes are targeted. For example, in patients with acute myo￾cardial infarction, progenitor cell transplantation is predicted 
to significantly modify postinfarction LV remodeling through 
enhanced neovascularization and reduced cardiomyocyte apopto￾sis, irrespective of long-term engraftment and transdifferentiation. 
Conversely, the former 2 mechanisms acting alone may have little 
or no benefit in patients with long-established scars, apart from 
the functional rescue of hibernating myocytes.
Given that myocardial ischemia acutely and potently upregulates 
the chemoattractants for neoangiogenesis (46), it was logical to test 
clinically an intracoronary infusion of bone marrow– or blood￾derived progenitor cells in patients with acute myocardial infarc￾Table 1

tion (Table 1 and Figure 2). All the published trials reported nearly 
identical results — a 7–9% improvement in global LV ejection frac￾tion, significantly reduced end-systolic LV volumes, and improved 
perfusion in the infarcted area — 4–6 months after cell transplan￾tation. Notably, in the only prospectively randomized trial so far 
(BOOST), global LV function was significantly improved in the 
cell-treated group compared with nontreated control subjects (16). 
Moreover, recent data from the TOPCARE-AMI trial, in which 
magnetic resonance was used as the optimal measure of LV func￾tion and mass, demonstrate that the improvement of LV function 
and absence of reactive hypertrophy are preserved even after 1 year, 
which suggests a sustained benefit on LV remodeling (17).
What technical variables might influence outcome? Surprisingly, 
none of the studies showed an association between cell numbers 
infused and extent of functional improvement over the ranges 
tested. Moreover, although the volumes of bone marrow harvested, 
the cell isolation procedures, and the number of cells infused varied 
considerably among trials, the reported improvements were nearly 
identical. Thus, it not yet possible to extract any critical elements 
of design that would maximize future studies’ chance of success. 
Importantly, however, in all 4 trials — comprising a total of more 
than 100 patients who received intracoronary progenitor cell trans￾plants — the observed complications did not exceed those expected 
in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Specifically, no arrhyth￾mic complications resulted from delivery of bone marrow–derived 
progenitor cells, whether at surgery or by percutaneous approaches.
By comparison, in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease 
and old myocardial infarction, the initial attempts at cell-based 
myocardial repair were more heterogeneous in outcome, likely 
owing in part to the more heterogeneous populations treated 
(Table 2). The first such trial used skeletal muscle–derived pro￾genitor cells, directly injected into the scarred region of the LV 
during open heart surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting 
(11). Global and regional LV function were significantly and 
persistently improved, although concomitant revascularization 
complicates the assessment of benefit. Indeed, in patients not 
undergoing simultaneous revascularization, transcatheter injec￾tion of myoblasts into the scar that had resulted from myocar￾dial infarction 5–6 years earlier reduced the symptoms of heart 
failure, but without objective evidence of improved global LV 
function (15). Unfortunately, even though previous extensive 
animal experiments provided no hint of an arrhythmogenic 
risk (21, 23), the enthusiasm for injecting myoblasts into scar 
tissue for cardiac repair has been dampened by the fact that 
patients receiving this treatment have experienced life-threat￾ening arrhythmias (47). Mechanistically, this phenomenon 
may relate to the lack of electrical coupling of skeletal muscle 
to neighboring cardiomyocytes (48) or, alternatively, be con￾tingent on coupling by the few hybrid cells formed by fusion 
with adjacent cardiomyocytes, which generate spatially hetero￾geneous calcium transients (49). Therefore, currently, implanta￾tion of skeletal myoblasts requires the placement as well of an 
Figure 2
Mechanisms of action. Progenitor cells may improve functional recovery of infarcted or failing myocardium by various potential mechanisms, 
including direct or indirect improvement of neovascularization. Paracrine factors released by progenitor cells may inhibit cardiac apoptosis, 
affect remodeling, or enhance endogenous repair (e.g., by tissue-resident progenitor cells). Differentiation into cardiomyocytes may contrib￾ute to cardiac regeneration. The extent to which these different mechanisms are active may critically depend on the cell type and setting, 
such as acute or chronic injury.

implantable cardioverter/defibrillator, as a mandatory adjunct 
to therapy (47). Importantly, in the 1 small, nonrandomized trial 
using bone marrow–derived progenitor cells for chronic ischemic 
heart failure, injection sites were chosen by electromechanical 
mapping of the LV endocardial surface to find areas of myocardial 
hibernation: significant increases in global LV ejection fraction 
resulted, with decreased end-systolic volumes and improved exer￾cise capacity (14). While this functional improvement might be 
secondary to an improved blood supply to hibernating cardiomyo￾cytes, it is also conceivable that an area of hibernating myocardium 
may provide a more favorable microenvironment for injected cells’ 
survival and engraftment than a cell-depleted scar.
Lessons from clinical pilot trials: 
more questions than answers
Thus, patients in 3 disparate clinical scenarios — days, months, or 
years following infarction — have been subjected to cell transplan￾tation for cardiac repair. In the case of acute myocardial infarction, 
the established safety and suggestive efficacy of intracoronary pro￾genitor cell transplantation provide a cogent rationale for larger, 
randomized, double-blind trials and for expanding such studies 
from Europe to the United States. In the case of chronic ischemic 
heart failure, an additional question is whether identifying hiber￾nating myocardium to direct cell therapy is essential to an effec￾tive outcome. It must also be shown whether delivery of skeletal 
myoblasts to established scar tissue late in the disease improves 
clinical outcome, once patients are protected against potential 
arrhythmias by an implantable defibrillator. Trials of each kind 
are currently ongoing and their results anticipated eagerly. Ulti￾mately, it must be proven that cellular therapy aimed at cardiac 
repair not only improves pump function but also reduces mortal￾ity, morbidity, or both.
Beyond safety, beyond efficacy, what else do we need to know 
clinically? For ischemic disease, the technical armament is in hand 
for treating patients’ hearts with progenitor cells but still at a 
very early stage — rudimentary experimental knowledge is being 
applied in the clinical arena, yet a variety of pivotal but straight￾forward utilitarian questions still remain unanswered (optimal 
patient selection, usefulness of repeated treatments). Nonischemic 
heart disease has yet to be addressed at all.
More complex and challenging is a series of pathobiological con￾cerns, which have sent the scientific community from bedside to 
bench and back again. Certain patients’ cells may be unsatisfactory, 
in their naive and unmanipulated state, which is now prompting 
systematic dissection of each step in progenitor cell function, from 
recruitment to plasticity. This task, in turn, is complicated by the 
fact that we do not yet understand the mechanisms underlying cell￾based cardiac repair. For instance, the efficacy of skeletal muscle 
myoblasts (23) provided the impetus for human trials of skeletal 
muscle cells, but in the rabbit, diastolic functions are improved 
even by injected fibroblasts (50) and systolic performance improved 
to the same degree with bone marrow–derived cells as with skel￾etal muscle ones (51). Along with the issue of skeletal muscle cells’ 
electrical isolation from host myocardium, this prompts the ques￾tion of how mechanical improvements arise even in this ostensibly 
straightforward instance. Another reason to consider potential 
indirect mechanisms is that studies have called into question the 
extent to which bone marrow–derived cells implanted in the heart 
form cardiomyocytes (33–35). The majority of this review is, there￾fore, devoted to the biological horizons — namely mobilization, 
homing, neoangiogenesis, and cardiac differentiation (Figures 3 
and 4) — and to evolving new insights that may enable cell therapy 
for cardiac repair to surpass the present state of the art.
Cell mobilization
The first hints that cytokine-induced mobilization may be a way 
to enhance cardiac repair came as an extrapolation of findings of 
results from efforts to increase EPC levels for neovascularization 
in another context — hind limb ischemia. Indeed, VEGF (52) and 
GM-CSF (53) were found to augment EPC levels and improve neo￾vascularization, and subsequent studies documented EPC mobili￾zation by numerous other proangiogenic growth factors — stromal 
cell–derived factor–1 (SDF-1), angiopoietin-1, placental growth 
factor, and erythropoietin (54–56). A wide array of interventions 
even more accessible clinically than growth factor administration 
enhance the number of circulating EPCs in adults, including treat￾ment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and estrogens 
as well as exercise (57–59). Most studies confirmed an improve￾ment in endothelial regeneration or neovascularization by mobi￾lizing agents. However, such functional improvements may not rely 
entirely on EPC mobilization but may also — at least in part — be 
explained by direct proangiogenic or antiapoptotic effects. Hence, 
as discussed as a recurring theme in this review, the existence of 
known (and potential unknown) pleiotropic modes of action com￾plicates the interpretation of regenerative therapies, even in cases 
where the beneficial effect is clear-cut and assured (Figure 3).

A shift in emphasis from the heart’s vessels to the heart itself 
was prompted by the report that bone marrow–derived cells can 
differentiate into cardiomyocytes when injected into injured myo￾cardium and regenerate the heart effectively (32). Based on this 
discovery, hematopoietic stem cell–mobilizing factors — G-CSF 
and SCF (Kit ligand) — were used to improve cardiac regeneration 
experimentally (60), which quickly led to the initiation of clinical 
trials studying the ability of G-CSF to mobilize stem/progenitor 
cells in patients with coronary artery disease. This cytokine is used 
routinely in the treatment of humans, e.g., to help in harvesting 
cells for bone marrow transplantation. Although results from 
these first small trials do not permit any conclusion of efficacy, the 
safety of G-CSF in acute myocardial infarction has already come 
into question (61). The observed increase in restenosis may be par￾tially explained by the study design (which precluded the standard 
clinical practice of promptly stenting the obstructed vessel), but 
the rise in leukocyte number to leukemic levels may be directly 
responsible, via plaque growth or destabilization. Adverse vascular 
events have also been attributed to G-CSF in patients with intrac￾table angina who were not candidates for revascularization and 
even in patients without cardiac disease (62). In the future, it may 
be preferable to use strategies that augment circulating progenitor 
cells without causing massive inflammation.
A second open question regarding systemic mobilization is wheth￾er enough progenitor cells will home where needed, to the sites of 
cardiac injury (63). Systemically administered human progeni￾tor cells were predominantly trapped by the 
spleen when given to athymic nude rats (44), 
and cardiac regeneration elicited by treatment 
with G-CSF plus SCF was documented only 
for animals lacking a spleen (60). The use of 
leukocyte-mobilizing cytokines might be most 
worthwhile combined with selective enhance￾ments of progenitor cell homing or as a pre￾lude to isolating cells for local delivery (63).
Cell homing
Defining the events in progenitor cell homing 
may enable better targeting of cells, most obvi￾ously when cells are mobilized from the bone 
marrow into the bloodstream. Later steps 
in homing, though, are instrumental to the 
impact even of progenitor cells infused locally 
into coronary arteries. Homing is a multistep 
cascade including the initial adhesion to acti￾vated endothelium or exposed matrix, trans￾migration through the endothelium, and, 
finally, migration and invasion of the target 
tissue (Figure 3). The capacity to migrate and invade may be pivotal 
to functional integration even when cells are injected intramuscular￾ly. Particularly in patients who lack the endogenous stimuli incited 
by acute ischemic injury, the enhancement of local homing signals 
or cells’ ability to respond may be of critical importance.
While homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to bone marrow 
has been studied extensively (64), the mechanisms for progenitor 
cells’ homing to sites of tissue injury are only understood rudi￾mentarily. SDF-1 appears to be one key factor that regulates traf￾ficking of stem and progenitor cells to ischemic tissue (65), and 
local delivery of SDF-1 can enhance EPC recruitment and neovas￾cularization (63, 66). Cell necrosis causes the release of a chroma￾tin-binding protein, high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), 
whose release acts as an extracellular “danger signal” and may 
stimulate progenitor cells’ homing (67). Extracellular HMGB1 
attracts mesoangioblasts in vitro and in vivo and likely plays a role 
in muscle regeneration (68). HMGB1 interacts with the receptor 
for advanced glycation end products, as well as Toll-like receptors 
2 and 4 (69). The exact mechanisms that mediate cell attraction 
by HMGB1 are not yet clear and may involve additional receptors 
that are as yet unidentified.
Adhesion and transmigration of stem and progenitor cells are 
mediated by integrins. Indeed, integrin-dependent adhesion of 
EPCs is one effect of SDF-1 (70). Particularly, β2 integrins were 
found to be essential for homing and improvement of neovascular￾ization mediated by EPCs after hind limb ischemia (71). In a study

delivery or mobilization from bone marrow, pro￾genitor cells are targeted to the sites of injury 
by multiple signals. Homing is mediated by a 
multistep process including the initial adhesion, 
transmigration, and invasion. Molecular mecha￾nisms contributing to these individual steps are 
indicated but likely vary depending on the cell 
type and model. EPO, erythropoietin; MCP-1,

of tumor angiogenesis focused on in vivo homing by embryonic 
EPCs from cord blood, the circulating cells arrested within tumor 
microvessels, extravasated into the interstitium, and incorporated 
into neovessels (72). The cells’ initial physical arrest was suggested 
to be mediated by E- and P-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein 
ligand–1 (72). However, this study was performed with embryonic 
endothelial progenitor cells in a tumor model of neovasculariza￾tion — distinct from therapeutic angiogenesis in both respects. 
Many of the chemokines and adhesion molecules induced by car￾diac ischemic injury are familiar players in other disorders (73), 
but different cell types may use different mechanisms for homing, 
and ischemia may differ from other attractants. Thus, a molecu￾lar dissection is essential to define the multiple steps of progeni￾tor cell homing to and invasion of the myocardium, especially for 
those cells in current use for clinical cardiac repair and for other, 
novel, auspicious cells now in preclinical studies (39).
Neoangiogenesis
To date, there is no direct clinical evidence that cellular cardiomyo￾genesis in fact occurs in the human heart after transplantation of 
progenitor cells. Angiogenesis, improvements in scar tissue, and 
cytoprotection must be considered, along with transdifferentia￾tion, as among the most important possible consequences of cell￾based therapies for cardiac repair (Figure 3). Of these, most obvi￾ously, progenitor cells may improve neovascularization, which in 
turn would augment oxygen supply. Progenitor cells are expected 
to be of most benefit to cardiac regeneration or performance when 
used to treat jeopardized or hibernating cardiomyocytes. Neovas￾cularization, in turn, can be mediated by the physical incorporation 
of progenitor cells into new capillaries (74, 75) or, in some settings, 
perivascular cells (76). Incorporated progenitor cells of most if not 
all types may release growth factors that promote angiogenesis by 
acting on mature endothelial cells (77). The extent to which pro￾genitor cells contribute to vasculogenesis by becoming physical 
elements of newly formed vessels versus acting through secreted 
factors may plausibly depend on the circumstances of cell type and 
cardiac injury. However, human bone marrow–derived angioblasts 
exert both types of effect (78).
Cells engineered to overexpress angiogenic factors might 
enhance both their own survival and that of the recipient myocar￾dium. As exemplified by the finding that myoblast-based delivery 
of VEGF led to an improved treatment outcome compared with 
direct viral gene transfer (79), cell therapy can be envisioned as 
a platform for secreted proteins’ local production in the injured 
myocardium. More simply, hypoxic “preconditioning” enhances 
the ability of EPCs to rescue hind limb ischemia (80), conceivably 
through activation of the angiogenic gene program: in differen￾tiating embryonic stem cells, formation of hemangioblasts (the 
common precursor of endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor 
cells) is activated by oxygen deprivation, requires hypoxia-induc￾ible factor, and is regulated by VEGF plus other local signals (81).
Cardiac myogenesis by noncardiac cells
The possibility of cardiomyocyte formation by multipotent pro￾genitor/stem cells first was raised by pioneering studies in which 
embryonic stem cells were grafted into mouse myocardium (82), 
the one cell type, along with germ cells, for which totipotency is 
assured. The formation of functional cardiomyocytes by mouse 
and human embryonic stem cells is proven according to many cri￾teria (83, 84). Although religious, ethical, and political objections 
to using human embryonic stem cells have received justifiable 
attention (85), human embryonic stem cells, being allogeneic, also 
pose the clinical challenge of immunological barriers (86), which 
are obviated in all forms of autologous cell therapy.
At times equalling the intensity, if not the religious character, 
of the dispute over human embryonic stem cells is the debate 
regarding the extent — and even the existence — of the plasticity 
of progenitor cells (87–90). Challenging but appropriate concerns 
have been raised regarding the nature of proof. Is the appearance 
of multiple lineages due merely to a mixed assortment of starting 
cells? For which cell types, settings, and means of administration 
does fusion of donor and host cells create the appearance of trans￾differentiation or multiple potentials? Is plasticity in propagated 
cells merely acquired in culture and not a reflection of native biol￾ogy? The latter question is especially thorny, since cloning cells 
to homogeneity is a useful response to the concern that the start￾ing population is mixed. Finally, developmental potential during 
normal maturation and in healthy adults may differ from plas￾ticity after injury, and it is necessary therefore to test the latter 
explicitly. It simply makes the most sense to study cells’ potential 
contributions to cardiac regeneration in settings, like infarction, 
where regeneration is most needed, rather than study plasticity 
just in normal hearts. The raging of this generic controversy about 
the plasticity of adult stem cells provides a partial explanation for 
the hostile climate in which claims of cardiac myogenesis by adult 
progenitor and stem cells have been received.
As proof of the concept that components of the heart can arise 
from a bone marrow source, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion 
injury was induced in mice following bone marrow reconstitution 
by treatment with ROSA26 SP cells (CD34–/lowKit+Sca-1+) that 
were genetically labeled to express β-gal ubiquitously (75). Donor￾derived myocytes were detected in the peri-infarct region, albeit 
at a prevalence of only 0.02%; endothelial cells derived from bone 
marrow were seen far more frequently (3.3%), as expected from the 
known origin of circulating EPCs. Recruitment of circulating bone 
marrow–derived cells to form cardiomyocytes also was shown in 
dystrophic mdx mice (91). In a particularly interesting study (32), 
female mice were subjected to permanent coronary artery occlu￾sion, and viable myocardium bordering the infarction was injected 
with Lin–Kit+ cells from the bone marrow of male transgenic mice 
widely expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP). These donor cells lack 
the surface markers of mature hematopoietic lineages but express 
the SCF receptor indicative of HSCs and some other primitive cell 
types. Extensive restorative growth was reported and donor origin 
shown by costaining for cardiac myosin plus the Y chromosome 
or green fluorescent protein. In addition, some EPFP+ cells stained 
for an endothelial or smooth muscle marker and were, morpho￾logically, organized into donor-derived vessels. Encouragingly, 
ventricular pump function was improved.
Subsequently, these results were challenged by researchers using 
seemingly identical conditions as well as complementary ones 
(33–35). In one example (34), the peri-infarct zone was injected 
with Lin–Kit+ cells from bone marrow of transgenic mice bearing an 
α–myosin heavy chain driven (αMHC-driven; cardiomyocyte-spe￾cific) transgene encoding nuclear-localized β-gal. No nuclei stained 
blue, nor was regeneration seen by alternative criteria, e.g., ectopic 
staining for sarcomeric MHC in the area of necrosis. Other bone 
marrow–derived populations (Lin–Kit–Sca+ cells from the αMHC￾nLacZ mice; Lin-Kit+ cells from αMHC- or βAct-EGFP mice) likewise 
failed to differentiate as donor cells (33–35). βAct-EGFP is expressed

in the donor cells even when undifferentiated, and its use as a con￾stitutive marker confirms that donor cells were successfully inject￾ed and retained in those studies where little or no cardiogenic dif￾ferentiation was seen.
Supporting the hypothesis of progenitor cell plasticity, though, 
wild-type bone marrow cells from βAct-EGFP donors give rise, rare￾ly, to cardiac muscle fibers and, more often, to small, presumptively 
developing myocytes, when transplanted into the bone marrow of 
Sod1 mutant mice (92). Independent studies have shown that bone 
marrow–derived progenitor cells can be reprogrammed to express 
cardiac marker genes in vitro, including bone marrow stromal cells 
(93), EPCs grown together with cardiomyocytes (94), and bone 
marrow cells grown in the presence of ostensibly angiogenic fac￾tors (95). Hence, there is little room to doubt that bone marrow 
cells and their derivatives can acquire a cardiomyogenic pheno￾type, but the extent to which such differentiation occurs in vivo 
for the cell types in clinical use still needs to be better defined.
Apart from technical disparities in the end points, differences in 
the starting cells must be considered, too, as numerically minor 
components could be the responsible ones — e.g., MAPCs and SP 
cells. Determining the number of donor MSCs might be of par￾ticular value: these are relatively abundant in bone marrow, can 
express c-Kit, and have clearer potential than hematopoietic cells do 
to form cardiomyocytes upon injection into the heart (96–98). In a 
side-by-side comparison to define the subpopulations from which 
cardiomyocytes were formed (99), mice received bone marrow trans￾plantation through the use of whole bone marrow, single long-term 
repopulating HSCs (“Tip”-SP Lin–CD34–c-Kit+Sca-1+ cells; ref. 28), 
or a clonal MSC line, all expressing EGFP. Recipient mice were sub￾jected to coronary artery ligation, with or without G-CSF to help 
mobilize engrafted cells. Whole bone marrow generated dozens of 
EGFP+ α-actinin+ cells per heart, or thousands if G-CSF had been 
used. Although single HSCs effectively reconstituted the bone mar￾row and the peripheral blood nucleated cells, purified HSCs pro￾vided little or no contribution to bone marrow MSCs, mesenchymal 
lineages in culture, or cardiomyocytes after infarction. Conversely, 
bone marrow transplantation with MSCs yielded hundreds of 
EGFP+ α-actinin+ cells. A plausible interpretation is that the MSCs 
in bone marrow — not HSCs — chiefly contribute to the creation 
of new cardiomyocytes following infarction. To date, human trials 
studying cardiac repair all have employed unfractionated bone mar￾row cells (presumably including bone marrow MSCs).
Cardiac myogenesis by adult cardiac progenitor cells
The quest for novel heart-forming cells in adult myocardium can 
be traced to several instigating rationales: the inability of skeletal 
myocytes to transdifferentiate; challenges to claims of bone mar￾row–derived cells’ far-ranging plasticity; and an emerging counter￾model of tissue-resident progenitor cells, sharing some signatures 
of “stemness” (100) yet predisposed to differentiate into lineages 
of the organ in which they reside.
In adults, the unique self-renewal potential of progenitor/stem 
cells — along with tumor cells and germ cells — is associated with 
telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), an RNA-dependent DNA 
polymerase that maintains the lariat-like loop (telomere) that caps 
chromosome ends (101). Telomerase expression and activity are 
markedly downregulated in the mouse heart soon after birth. A 
small number of cardiac cells express the surface marker stem cell 
antigen–1 (Sca-1), and this population, unlike Sca-1– cells, contains 
telomerase at levels akin to those in newborn hearts (39). Cardiac￾resident Sca-1+ cells lack the HSC markers CD45 and CD34 (also a 
marker of EPCs), lack hematopoietic transcription factors (Lmo2, 
Gata2, Tal), and thus are readily distinguished from bone marrow 
HSCs. Cardiac Sca-1+ cells also lack transcripts for cardiac struc￾tural genes but, intriguingly, express the majority of known car￾diogenic transcription factors (Mef2c, Gata4, Srf, and Tead1/TEF-1, 
excepting a handful of others), congruent with the postulated prop￾erties of cardiac progenitor cells as undifferentiated yet predisposed 
to become cardiomyocytes.
In culture, cardiac Sca-1+ cells express Nkx2.5, after which cardiac 
structural genes are activated, if treated with 5′-azacytidine to relax 
condensed chromatin (ref. 39; and see ref. 93). As evidence that 
differentiation was specific, and not a nondescript response to the 
DNA methylation inhibitor, inducing αMHC required the signal 
transduction pathway for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), 
as differentiation was blocked by ex vivo deletion of the type IA 
BMP receptor (39). Adult cardiac Sca-1+ cells form beating cardio￾myocytes with spontaneous calcium transients and may possess 
multipotency (41). However, multipotency needs to be proven in 
the progeny of single cells.
When given intravenously to mice just after ischemia-reperfusion 
injury, cardiac Sca-1+ cells home selectively to injured myocardium, 
interdigitate with surrounding host myocytes, and demonstrate 
robust differentiation in situ, constituting approximately 15% of 
the myocytes in the infarct “border zone” 2 weeks after grafting 
(39). Roughly 5% of donor-derived myocytes were still proliferat￾ing, as indicated by serine 10 phosphorylation of histone H3, a 
marker of Cdc2 activity. Given the possible existence of cell fusion 
as a confounding factor (102), a pair of genetic tags was utilized: 
αMHC-Cre, the cardiomyocyte–specific expression of the DNA 
recombinase used widely for tissue-restricted knockout muta￾tions, plus R26R, a ubiquitously transcribed but latent gene for 
β-gal (behind a Cre-deletable “stop” signal). αMHC-Cre is inactive 
in cardiac Sca-1+ cells in their initial undifferentiated state. Hence, 
the induction of Cre protein fulfills 2 roles — as a marker of donor 
cell identity and of differentiation in situ. Cre+LacZ– cells are de 
novo differentiation products, whereas Cre+LacZ+ ones denote dif￾ferentiation associated with fusion (though not indicating which 
came first). The two modes of differentiation were equally preva￾lent. The extent of cell fusion in other models of cardiac repair 
must be determined empirically.
An intriguing subgroup within the Sca-1+ fraction consists of SP 
cells, discussed earlier in connection with bone marrow. SP cells 
have been found in other tissues, through use of the same flow 
cytometry test for dye efflux as is used for the SP cells in bone 
marrow itself. While many related transport proteins may provide 
a molecular marker for SP cells of the heart, Abcg2 seems to best 
serve this function in development and disease (42). Genes whose 
expression is enriched in cardiac SP cells include Ly6a (encoding 
Sca-1), genes for the cardiogenic transcription factors MEF2A and 
MEF2C, and genes suggesting that SP cells share an origin or devel￾opmental pathway with endothelial and hematopoietic cells.
Although cardiac Sca-1+ cells were typically negative for c-Kit (39, 
41), this second marker also holds importance in heart. Prompted 
by the successful use of Kit+ bone marrow cells in cardiac repair 
(32), cardiac-resident Kit+ cells were sought (40): Lin– c-Kit+ cells 
were found in adult rat myocardium with a prevalence of approxi￾mately 1 per 104 mature myocytes, frequently in clusters, with 
varying expression of cardiogenic transcription factors and rarer 
expression of cardiac-restricted sarcomeric proteins. As with car-

diac Sca-1+ cells (39), cardiac c-Kit+ cells lack CD45 and CD34 (40). 
Cardiac c-Kit+ cells were self-renewing (propagated for months), 
clonogenic (expanded in culture after plating 1 cell per well), and 
multipotential (generating cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, 
and endothelial cells) (40). When injected into the border of new 
infarcts, cardiac c-Kit+ cells led to bands of regenerating myocardi￾um in the region of necrosis, contributed to endothelium and vas￾cular smooth muscle, and improved pump function and chamber 
geometry (40), much as the authors had reported using bone mar￾row c-Kit+ cells (32). Results with clonally derived cardiac c-Kit+
cells were equivalent to those with the initial cardiac c-Kit+ popu￾lation, which suggests that an expandable source from within the 
heart might be applied to cardiac repair.
Where and how do cardiac progenitor or stem cells arise in the 
heart? Various models can be considered, ranging from persis￾tence as undifferentiated remnants of heart-forming tissue in the 
early embryo, to a hematogenous origin (from bone marrow or 
even sites of earlier hematopoiesis, losing HSC markers in the 
process), to mechanisms involving ingrowth of the developing 
coronary vasculature. As an example of the first mechanism, 
postnatal cardioblasts numbering just a few hundred per heart 
have been identified on the basis of persistent expression of a 
LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, Isl1, especially in the 
atria, right ventricle, and outflow tract — regions where Isl1 is 
most prevalently expressed during cardiac organogenesis (43). 
By contrast, for cardiac Sca-1+ cells, the third potential mecha￾nism may be favored, given the cells’ striking similarities to the 
mesoangioblast, which include surface labeling, microarray find￾ings, and earliest sites of marker expression (39, 103). How many 
cardiomyocytes, if any, are generated in the normal heart after 
birth by these new routes to heart muscle cell formation? What is 
the contribution of these pathways, unassisted, to cardiomyocyte 
formation in disease, as a reserve for the replacement of dead and 
dying cells? To answer these questions, the genetic strategy of 
fate mapping is likely relevant — indelibly tagging cells with an 
irreversible marker of their status — using, for example, a Sca-1–
driven gene for Cre recombinase plus a Cre-dependent reporter 
to permanently label the progeny of Sca-1+ cells, even once Sca-1 
is no longer expressed.
Cell augmentation for cardiac repair
The findings of unexpected persistence of cardiopoietic cells in 
adult hearts and effective cardiac repair by the noncardiac cells in 
current trials raise a number of fascinating questions. Although 
cell-based therapy has only taken its first steps into the clinic, lim￾iting factors have already arisen as targets for future improvement. 
Ultimately, engineered cells may supercede naive cells.
First, how can one make delivered cells more durable, consider￾ing the adverse environment? Most stem cells share the property 
of stress resistance (100), but even stem cells die in the absence of 
blood flow. This concern is especially apt when progenitor cells are 
directly delivered into unperfused necrotic myocardium. Targeting 
injections to the margin of injury where oxygen supply persists is 
immediately workable (14), and biological means to augment the 
cells’ survival are on the horizon, including the use of angiogenic 
factors, as discussed (79), or modification of MSCs with the anti￾apoptotic gene Akt (96).
Second, how can one restore progenitor cells to normal, where 
they are deficient in number or function? The functional capac￾ity of bone marrow–derived cells is defective in patients with 
heart failure (104), and risk factors for atherosclerosis correlate 
inversely with the numbers and function of circulating EPCs (105, 
106). Stem cell defects also occur as a consequence of aging (107, 
108). Potential remedies include statins, which not only reduce 
risk factor load by lipid-lowering but also delay the onset of cel￾lular senescence, telomere “uncapping,” and DNA damage signals 
in human EPCs (109, 110). A Myb-like telomere-capping protein, 
telomere repeat-binding factor–2, is downregulated by cell stress 
cascades (4) and mediates the beneficial effect of statins on EPC 
function (110). Direct interference with telomere-based aging and 
death signals might also be achieved through the forcible expres￾sion of TERT (4, 111, 112). Antioxidants or growth factors also 
might be used to promote telomerase activity (108, 113). TERT 
and other cell cycle activators may be useful in prolonging donor 
cell cycling either ex vivo or, especially if tightly controlled, fol￾lowing engraftment. Interestingly, the nuclear export of cyclin D1 
and cyclin D3 limits these proteins’ impact on cardiac regenera￾tion when overexpressed in their wild-type form, whereas cyclin 
D2 is not excluded from the nucleus and led to marked infarct 
Figure 4
Current challenges for cell-based therapy in cardiac repair include identifying the origins of the novel cardiac progenitor and stem cells found 
within the heart, pinpointing the biologically active cells from bone marrow and other mixed populations, optimizing cell mobilization and homing, 
augmenting grafted cells’ survival, defining the cues for cardiac differentiation, promoting donor cell proliferation ex vivo (or, if safe, in vivo), and 
exploiting cell therapy as a platform for secretory signals.

regression (3). In this regard, it should prove instructive to under￾stand better the molecular mechanisms that lock the cell cycle in 
terminally differentiated mammalian cardiomyocytes, including 
tumor suppressor proteins of the retinoblastoma family (114), 
and those that maintain a competence for cardiac proliferation 
in model organisms with enhanced capacity for cardiac repair (1, 
2). The utility of zebrafish arises not only from the accessibility of 
its development outside the mother, but also (unlike chicks and 
frogs) from the fact that genome-wide mutagenesis is workable, 
while daunting, and several genes needed to drive heart repair 
have already been identified. These include Mps1, encoding a 
mitotic checkpoint kinase that is induced in the highly prolifera￾tive cells of the regeneration blastema (1). Blastemal regeneration, 
including that of the zebrafish heart, is also thought to entail the 
transient induction of Notch pathway components and Msx tran￾scription factors (115, 116).
Third, what drives the cardiac fate in adult heart-forming cells? 
While some mechanisms for cardiac specification in injured adult 
hearts might differ from those in early embryos, better knowledge 
of the “wiring diagram” for commitment to the cardiac fate is 
expected to yield useful clues to enhance the differentiation pro￾cess in susceptible cell types and even extend the range of donor 
cells that form heart muscle well (8, 117). Evidence for the impor￾tance of oxytocin in both early heart and adult cardiac Sca-1+ cells 
is a recent example (41, 118). Multiple autocrine or paracrine 
factors, from host myocardium or donor cells, provide essential 
instructions to enter the cardiac muscle lineage. Blocking TGF-β
or its relative, BMPs, prevents embryonic stem cells from becom￾ing cardiomyocytes during coculture with ventricular muscle cells 
and following injection of the heart (119). Conversely, PDGF-AB 
enhances the induction of cardiac genes and beating cell aggre￾gates in cultured bone marrow cells and increases the number of 
intra-scar cardiomyocyte islands when coinjected with bone mar￾row cells (95). As-yet-undefined local factors mediate the induc￾tive effect of cardiomyocytes on cocultured EPCs (94) and isl1+
cardiac cells (43). Notably, azacytidine was key to activating the 
cardiomyocyte program in immortalized bone marrow stromal 
cells (93) and in cardiac Sca-1+ cells (39), and other epigenetic 
modifiers can be foreseen. High-throughput chemical and genetic 
screens will likely identify novel activators of cardiac myogenesis.
In summary, the existence of cardiac and noncardiac progenitor 
cells that are efficacious in cardiac repair next should stimulate 
vigorous inquiry into means to activate their migration, survival, 
growth, and differentiation (Figure 4). These are questions of great 
importance, whether one is envisioning the manipulation of cells 
ex vivo for subsequent administration or contemplating, instead, 
the activation of latent cells within the injured heart.
Finally, another approach to cardiac repair might be deemed 
“cell-free therapy. It remains formally unproven whether cardiac 
myogenesis is instrumental to improved cardiac function in the 
cell-based therapies discussed here, and other modes of action 
can be considered, beyond just angiogenesis, rescue of hibernat￾ing myocytes, and prevention of ventricular thinning. Potential 
paracrine actions of cell therapies might include immunomodula￾tory effects, as has been shown for mesenchymal stem cells (120), 
and other signals to modulate scar healing and remodeling. Addi￾tionally, paracrine mechanisms might suppress host cell death 
directly, both in acute infarction and in chronic heart failure, 
regardless of cause. A remarkable illustration of this principle is the 
discovery that thymosin β4 — a secreted protein associated with the 
early heart on the one hand and with wound healing on the other 
— promotes cardiac cell migration, survival, and repair, working 
through the Akt survival pathway (121). Perhaps a primary role of 
cell therapy — at least for some modalities — is paracrine or che￾moattractive. To what extent defined signals can bypass the need 
for cells in cardiac repair is unknown. At least for the moment, our 
cells likely know more than we do.
