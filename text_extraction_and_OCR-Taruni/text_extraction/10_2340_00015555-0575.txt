Sir,
Scopulariopsis is a genus of non-dermatophytic filamen￾tous fungi. These common saprophytic fungi are found in 
soil, on vegetables and other organic waste, and have a 
wide geographic distribution. Scopulariopsis brevicaulis
is not generally considered to be a skin pathogen, al￾though it is the cause of nearly 2% of reported cases of 
onychomycoses. Several case reports have described S. 
brevicaulis infections of deep tissue or skin in immuno￾compromised hosts and there have been sporadic cases of 
ocular infection. We describe here an otherwise healthy 
person presenting a slowly progressive granulomatous 
skin infection caused by S. brevicaulis.
CASE REPORT
A 19-year-old man presented with an intensely itchy irregular granu￾lomatous induration on the right submental area of his face (Fig. 1A), 
which had been present for 2 months. Initially he developed eczema￾like lesions at the infra-orbital area, which he scratched often, and 
subsequent lesions had developed on the right side of his chin (Fig. 
1B). He had been treated previously by doctors at local clinics with 
topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamine without benefit. He 
was otherwise in good health. He had not had a previous significant 
illness and was not receiving any drug therapy when the skin lesions 
appeared. The patient’s medical history included atopic diathesis and 
asthma with allergic rhinitis. A thorough dermatological examination 
revealed no dermatological signs of atopic dermatitis.
The patient was suspected clinically of having acne excoriée 
complicated with impetigo. A specimen taken from the right sub￾mental area showed focal ulceration of epidermis with splitting at 
the dermal-epidermal junction and mixed inflammatory infiltrates 
in the necrotizing dermis (Figs 2A, B). Small intra-epidermal 
neutrophilic pustules were also seen. Several fungal hyphae in 
necrotic dermis and stratum corneum were stained with Periodic 
acid-Schiff (PAS) (Fig. 2C) and Grocott’s Methenamine Silver 
(GMS) (Fig. 2D). No micro-organisms were found in the bacterial 
cultures of the skin specimens. Fungal cultures grew S. brevicaulis.
The colonies were powdery white, slightly buff in colour. Under 
the microscope, the fungi appear as hyalined and septated hyphae 
with conidiophores terminating in groups of 2–4 annellophores in 
a broom-like structure. The annelloconidia were globose to ovoid 
and had a distinctly truncated base (Fig. 2E). The fungal samples 
were sent to Taiwan’s National Medical Mycology Laboratory for 
direct DNA sequencing and were confirmed to be S. brevicaulis 
by Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool (BLAST). 
In our laboratory studies, complete blood count was normal 
except for high eosinophil count (16.2% × 9860). Eosinophil ca￾tionic protein (ECP) was 32.2 μg/l (< 18 μg/l) and immunoglo￾bulin E (IgE) was 3302 IU/ml (66.4–109.0 IU/ml). Total T-cell 
and B-cell counts were within normal limits, whereas active 
T-cell counts were low (5.89 %; normal range 9.69–22.03%). 
HIV test was negative. HLA-DR positive lymphocytes were 
low (26.70%; normal range 28.36–46.10%). 
Initially, the patient was prescribed doxycycline (200 mg) for acne. 
Three weeks later, after the S. brevicaulis infection was confirmed, he 
was prescribed a daily dose of itraconazole 200 mg and doxycycline 
200 mg. After 3 months on the regimen, because there were impro￾vements in his condition but also signs hepatoxicity (liver enzymes 
elevation), itraconazole was stopped and replaced with indomethacin. 
Improvement in the lesions was maintained with doxycycline 200 mg 
+ indomethacin 75 mg for the following 8 months, as granulomatous 
indurations at the submental area had notably regressed, leaving only 
hypertrophic scars (Fig. 1C). In the ninth month of follow-up, there 
was no recurrence of the lesions. Upon examination, we found fewer 
erythematous indurations. These scars were found to be keloidal scars 
instead of those caused by cutaneous granulomas.

DISCUSSION
The spectrum of severe human mycoses includes the 
formation of fungus balls in preformed pulmonary 
cavities (1), keratitis (2), post-traumatic endophthal￾mitis (3), disseminated skin lesions in patients with 
AIDS (4), granulomatous subcutaneousinfections (5). 
invasive hyalohyphomycosis (6), pneumonia in leukae￾mic patients (7), endocarditis related to valvuloplasty
or prosthetic valves (8), and even fatal disseminated 
infection following bone marrow transplantation (9). 
Only a meticulous investigation, including the growth 
of colonies in culture, microscopic identification of mor￾phology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing, 
will make the accurate diagnosis of S. brevicaulis pos￾sible. Initially, the surface of the colony is usually white 
and glabrous, but it may become powdery light brown 
with a light tan periphery. Scopulariopsis spp. resemble 
Penicillium spp., but have shorter and sometimes simpler 
conidiophores; the conidium-bearing cells are annellides 
rather than phialides and may be more cylindrical. The 
conidia are larger, rough, and uniquely shaped and can be 
identified by as they are cut off at one end (10). 
Several authors have reported that S. brevicaulis
is resistant to amphotericin B, flucytosine, and azole 
compounds (11, 12). Similarly, a recent 5-year retro￾spective multicentre study of nail infections has reported 
Scopulariopsis to be treatment-resistant, with only 18% 
of cases documented to benefit from treatment (12). De￾bridement or excision of necrotic tissue and antifungal 
chemotherapy is often the treatment of choice (7). The 
prognosis depends mainly on the patient’s immune sta￾tus and the feasibility of surgical debridement (9). 
The patient’s atopic diathesis complicated his infec￾tion. The reason for this may be that atopy, in which 
overactive Th2 cells induce immediate hypersensitivity 
responses to antigen, inhibits or overpowers the ability 
of the Th1 cells to maintain a delayed type hypersen￾sitivity response. The predominance of Th1 over Th2 
type cytokines correlates with protection against various 
mycoses (13). Thus, the reduction in Th1 cells makes 
the patient more susceptible to fungal infection.
