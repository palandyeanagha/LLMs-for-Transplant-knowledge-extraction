Abstract
Background: The genomic alterations of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in the Chinese population have not 
been fully revealed. Molecular profiling may provide a reference for clinical management, especially targeted therapy.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 122 ICC patients. All patients’ samples underwent next-generation 
sequencing (NGS), which analyzed 417 genes. The genetic characteristics, clinical management and therapeutic 
responses were analyzed.
Results: The most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (34%), KRAS (25%) and ARID1A (17%). Targeted agents were 
used referring to molecular profiling, in combination with chemotherapy. Twenty-two patients with wild-type KRAS/
NRAS/BRAF were treated with cetuximab. The disease control and response rates were 78% and 47%, respectively, 
which were higher than those achieved with chemotherapy alone (72% and 11%, P=0.16). Fifty-four patients under￾went anti-VEGF treatment with bevacizumab. The disease control and response rates were 85% and 60%, respectively. 
Better therapeutic efficiency (P=0.001) and longer progression-free survival (PFS) were observed in the bevacizumab￾treated group compared to chemotherapy alone group (15.4 and 6.7 months, respectively; P=0.04). The PFS of ten 
patients who underwent hepatectomy after combined treatment with chemotherapy and bevacizumab was longer 
than that of 139 patients who underwent surgical treatment (28.9 vs 18.0 months, P=0.03). Two patients (1.6%) had 
signatures of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), and both benefited from immunotherapy.
Conclusions: This study provides an overview of genetic alterations in Chinese ICC patients and indicates the poten￾tial clinical implications for NGS-based personalized therapies.

Background
The incidence of liver cancer ranks 4th among the Chi￾nese population according to data published by the 
National Central Cancer Registry of China (NCCR) 
[1]. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the sec￾ond most common type and accounts for 10–20% of all

primary liver cancers [2, 3]. The increasing incidence rate 
and aggressive clinical course of ICC contribute to its 
high mortality [4]. Surgical resection remains the main￾stay of potentially curative treatment for patients with 
early-stage disease, but few treatment options are avail￾able for the majority of patients with advanced-stage or 
unresectable disease. The combination of gemcitabine 
and cisplatin is still the standard of care for patients with 
advanced and metastatic disease, and no standard tar￾geted therapy has been proven in clinical trials [5–7]. 
Pembrolizumab and pemigatinib have been currently 
approved to treat 10% of patients with specific genetic 
characteristics, while precise treatments are urgently 
needed to improve the survival of the remaining 90% of 
patients with advanced disease.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an ideal tool to 
categorize patients with ICC based on molecular profiles 
[8], and few large-scale sequencing studies have focused 
on the genomic characteristics of ICC in the Chinese 
population. The molecular phenotypes of ICC have not 
yet been revealed and represent a rational personalized 
therapeutic approach.
In this study, NGS was performed on 122 Chinese ICC 
patient samples to elucidate the molecular profiles, and 
target or immune agents were administered based on the 
genetic characteristics.
Methods
Patients
Patients were identified over a 4-year period starting in 
April 2015 and were deemed eligible for the study if they 
had a confirmed histological diagnosis of ICC. Written 
informed consent for tumor profiling was obtained from 
each patient upon their first admission to Fudan Univer￾sity Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC). The study proto￾col was approved by the FUSCC ethics committee (No. 
218-1611 and No. 050432-4-1911D).
The clinical data and NGS results for 122 patients with 
ICC were available at the time of analysis. Overall sur￾vival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 
collected.
Survival data of 139 patients accepted curative surgery 
for ICC in the same center was used.
Sample collection and preparation
Previously collected fresh tissue and blood samples were 
used in this study. The tissues were obtained through 
laparoscopic surgery or core needle biopsy. The fresh 
tissue was soaked in 5 times the volume of 4% formal￾dehyde solution within 30  min. A wax block was made 
within 24 h after soaking the tissue, and it was sent to the 
pathologist for diagnosis and review. The specimens were 
sent to the laboratory for NGS detection within 48 h at 
4–8 °C. Twenty milliliters of peripheral blood was drawn 
and sent to the laboratory within 48 h at 15–35 °C.
Tissue samples with an estimated tumor purity<10% 
based on histopathological assessment were deemed 
insufficient for sequencing. The standard amount of DNA 
input was 250 ng, and the minimum input was 50 ng in 
cases for which the DNA quality was limited. Matched 
germline DNA from prospectively collected blood sam￾ples was analyzed for all patients.
Tissue and plasma DNA isolation and purification
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from formalin￾fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples using the 
GeneRead DNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen, USA), and gDNA was 
extracted from the white blood cell samples using the 
DNA Blood Midi/Mini kit (Qiagen, USA). The quality 
of purified DNA was assayed by gel electrophoresis and 
quantified by the Qubit® 4.0 fluorometer (Life Technolo￾gies, USA).
Library construction and bioinformatics analysis
Purified gDNA was first fragmented into DNA pieces 
approximately 200–300  bp in size using an enzymatic 
method (5X WGS Fragmentation Mix, Qiagen, USA). 
After end repair, tailing and T-adaptor ligation by poly￾merase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate a 
prelibrary, and the products were then subjected to exon 
capture. Captured fragments were subsequently puri￾fied and hybridized by a 417-gene panel (Additional 
file  1: Table  S1). FASTP [9] was used to trim adapt￾ers and remove low-quality sequences to obtain clean 
reads, which were aligned to the Ensemble GRCh37/
hg19 reference genome by BWA [10]. PCR duplicates 
were processed by GenCore [11], and consensus reads 
were generated. SAMtools [12] was utilized for the detec￾tion of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions 
and deletions, and Human Genome Variation Society 
(HGVS) variant descriptions were annotated by ANNO￾VAR [13] software. After annotation, SNVs with a Pop￾FreqMax>0.05 were excluded, and nonsynonymous 
SNVs with a variant allele frequency (VAF)>0.5% or a 
VAF>0.1% in cancer hotspots collected from the patient 
database were retained for further analysis.
The microsatellite instability (MSI) statuses of all tis￾sue samples were determined, and this score was used 
to classify the samples into three groups, MSI-high,≥2 
unstable microsatellite loci; MSI-low, only 1 instable 
locus; and microsatellite stable (MSS), no locus instabil￾ity. The MSI-high results were further confirmed by PCR 
validation.
The tumor mutational burden (TMB) was estimated by 
somatic nonsynonymous mutations per megabase of the 
panel sequences examined.

(https://www.kegg.jp).
Immunohistochemical analysis of PD‑L1
The tissue was placed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution 
for 12h. Then, the tissues were dehydrated with 75% and 
95% absolute ethanol each for 1.5h at 60–70  °C. Next, 
the tissues were soaked in 40 °C dichloromethane for 4h 
and then rehydrated with absolute ethanol, 95% ethanol, 
75% ethanol and distilled water for 1 h, 0.5 h, 1 h and 1 h, 
respectively, at 60–70 °C. The samples were then embed￾ded in paraffin wax, and ultrathin Sects. (5 µm) were cut 
using an ultramicrotome (Lecia RM2126RT, Germany), 
mounted on glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin for analyzing tissue structures using an upright 
fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE2000-S, Nikon, 
Japan).
We performed immunohistochemical studies to evalu￾ate programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on 
tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells (ICs) using the Ven￾tana SP263 assay with the Ventana BenchMark GX sys￾tem (Roche/Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA) 
according to the recommended protocol. A rabbit mono￾clonal anti-human PD-L1 antibody (clone SP263, Roche/
Ventana) was used. The slides were immersed in acetone 
(3 min) and xylene (10 min) to remove the coverslip; the 
sections were then rehydrated with alcohol in decreasing 
concentrations and immersed in distilled water. Anti￾gen retrieval was performed with Cell Conditioner 1 for 
64 min against SP263. The sections were then incubated 
with the specific primary antibody for 16  min against 
SP263. Subsequently, the sections were treated with the 
OptiView HQ Linker for 8  min and the OptiView HRP 
Multimer for 8  min. Finally, counterstaining was per￾formed with Mayer’s hematoxylin and Scott’s tap water 
bluing reagent. The evaluation of the stained tissue sec￾tions was performed by two investigators who had no 
knowledge of the patients’ clinical status. Cases with 
discrepancies were jointly re-evaluated until a consen￾sus was reached. PD-L1 expression was calculated as the 
percentage of membrane staining on TCs or ICs in the 
overall area of the tumor, regardless of intensity.
Clinical management
Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy was used as the first￾line chemotherapeutic treatment in this study, and com￾binatory strategies included cisplatin, oxaliplatin and 
capecitabine. Some patients accepted additional target/
immune therapies (detailed in Additional file 2: Table S2). 
Patients refused the suggested target/immune therapies 
would accept chemotherapy alone. The Common Termi￾nology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 criteria 
were used to evaluate adverse events.
Follow-up was conducted every 8  weeks at the low￾est frequency. Enhanced abdominal CT/MR scans and 
serum CA19-9 levels were examined, and Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria 
were used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy.
Statistics analysis
To evaluate the association of clinical characteristics or 
genes, Fisher’s exact test was performed. Odds ratios and 
false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P values were also 
calculated. PFS was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier 
method, and the Chi square test was used to compare 
therapeutic efficiencies between patients treated with dif￾ferent strategies and between those with different genetic 
alterations. The PFS rate was calculated as the time from 
the treatment start date to the date of progression or 
death. For patients who underwent surgical procedures, 
recurrence after curative resection or progression after 
palliative surgery was considered progression. Patients 
alive and without progression were censored to the date 
of the last follow-up.
Results
Samples from 122 individual patients with ICC were ana￾lyzed. Clinical characters are summarized in Table 1.
A total of 692 genetic alterations were identified among 
121 of the 122 samples, while no somatic genetic alter￾ations were identified in the remaining sample. The 
median number of mutations per sample was 5, and 
the most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (34%), 
KRAS (25%), and ARID1A (17%). Among multiple genes, 
potentially oncogenic focal copy number variations were 
noted, including ADAM29 (5%) and CDKN2A (5%) dele￾tions and ERBB2 (8%), CDK12 (4%), FAM135B (4%), 
FRS2 (4%), and MDM2 (4%) amplifications. Rearrange￾ments were mostly noted in BCL2L11 (7%, Fig.  1 and 
Table 2). Potentially actionable alterations were enriched 
in FoxO signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, 
platinum drug resistance, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
resistance, ErbB signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling 
pathway (Fig. 2).
Two patient samples (1.6%) had MSI-H signatures, and 
the immunohistochemical results for PD-L1 were nega￾tive in patient sample A and positive (1%) in patient sam￾ple B (Fig.  3). The total immunohistologically-positive 
PD-L1 rate in tumor tissues was 16%, and the median 
expression rate in a single tumor was 5% (range 1–25%). 
The TMBs for patients A and B were 42 and 48 muta￾tions/Mb, respectively. Patient A was a 57-year-old male 
with a history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and 
he was diagnosed with local advanced left lobe cholan￾giocarcinoma with intrahepatic metastasis, vessel inva￾sion and lymph node metastasis. The patient was treated 

Wang et al. J Transl Med (2020) 18:273 Page 4 of 11
with pembrolizumab for 8  months, and he accepted 
stereotactic body radiation therapy after the 8th treat￾ment cycle. During radiation therapy, the patient was 
diagnosed with transient hyponatremia and accepted 
supportive treatment. The patient exhibited a partial 
response (Additional file 3: Figure S1) and was alive as of 
the analysis date. Patient B was a 46-year-old male with 
a history of HBV infection, and he was diagnosed with 
local advanced left lobe massive cholangiocarcinoma and 
lymph node metastasis. After 4 cycles of pembrolizumab 
treatment, the tumor was deemed stable and shrank by 
7%. A left hemihepatectomy without lymphadenectomy 
was performed at 4 weeks after the 4th treatment cycle, 
and the 5th treatment cycle began at 4  weeks after the 
surgery. The patient was alive without tumor metastasis 
as of the analysis date.
ERBB2 alterations were found in 13 (11%) patients, and 
10 of the 13 patients exhibited ERBB2 gene amplifica￾tion. Eight patients with ERBB2 amplification received 
anti-HER2 therapy combined with basic chemotherapy, 
and the application of trastuzumab achieved a disease 
control rate of 7/8. Specifically, the stable disease rate was 
1/8, the partial response rate was 6/8, and the complete 
response rate was 0/8. One patient exhibited grade 3 neu￾tropenia, and two patients with partial responses under￾went exploratory laparotomy after systemic treatment. 
The tumor from one patient remained unresectable 
after surgical exploration, and the other patient accepted 
radical hemihepatectomy treatment. The patient had 
not experienced recurrence as of the analysis date. The 
median PFS time for trastuzumab-treated patients was 
7.3 (1–27) months.
BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in 16 (13%) patients, 
and most of these mutations were somatic (14 patients, 
11%). One patient with a BRCA2 germline mutation 
had previously underwent mastectomy for breast can￾cer before the diagnosis of ICC. Four patients accepted 
poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (olaparib) 
treatment combined with chemotherapy. Two patients 
achieved stable disease, and two patients responded 
partially. Herein, no cases of complete response or dis￾ease progression and no grade 3–4 toxic effects were 
observed.
KRAS/NRAS/BRAF alterations occurred in 36 (30%) 
patients. Among the 86 patients with no mutations, 22 
accepted cetuximab treatment combined with chemo￾therapy. The disease control and response rates were 
78% and 47%, respectively, which were higher than those 
achieved with chemotherapy alone (72% and 11%); the 
differences were not statistically significant (P=0.16), 
and no complete response was observed. Patients in the 
cetuximab group had a longer PFS time than those in the 
chemotherapy group (9.0 vs 6.7 months), but the differ￾ence was not statistically significant (P=0.51, Additional 
file  4: Figure S2). Grade 3 toxic effects included rashes 
(n=5) and neutropenia (n=2), and no grade 4 toxic 
effects were observed.
One patient acquired an NRAS mutation in the 5th 
month of cetuximab treatment, which was diagnosed via 
imaging and further confirmed by NGS (Additional file 5: 
Figure S3).
Fifty-four patients received anti-VEGF treatment 
(bevacizumab) combined with chemotherapy, and the 
disease control and response rates were 85% and 60%, 
respectively. KRAS/NRAS/BRAF were wild-type in 
33/54 patients and mutated in 21/54 patients. Two (4%) 
patients had complete responses, and 30 (56%) patients 
had partial responses. At 6  weeks after treatment, one 
patient had a stroke, which was diagnosed as a grade 3 
adverse event; VEGFA amplification was detected in 
this patient’s specimen. After 4 weeks of treatment, one 
patient exhibited acute kidney failure, which was diag￾nosed as a grade 5 adverse event. The clinical features of

the patient indicated tumor lysis syndrome (Additional 
file  6: Figure S4). Other grade 3 toxic effects included 
neutropenia (n=2) and hypertension (n=1). Patients in 
the bevacizumab group had a better therapeutic effect 
(P=0.001) and a longer PFS time (15.4 vs 6.7  months, 
P=0.04) than those in the chemotherapy group (Fig. 4). 
After systemic treatment, nine (17%) patients with par￾tial responses and one (2%) patient with a complete 
response underwent exploratory laparotomy followed 
by hepatectomy. Pathological diagnosis revealed tumor 
activity in the patient with a clinically complete response. 
We compared the PFS time of the 10 patients with 139 
patients accepted radical hepatectomy treatment in our 
center. Patients accepted pre-operation systemic treat￾ment acquired a longer PFS time compare to patients 
accepted surgery treatments along (28.9 vs 18.0 months, 
P=0.03; Fig. 5). The therapeutic regimens used based on 
genetic alterations were summarized in Table 3.
Furthermore, overall patients accepted target or 
immune therapy agencies (n=90) had a longer PFS 
than those in the chemotherapy group (n=18; 19.3 vs 
6.7 months). There was an obvious tendency, but the dif￾ference was not statistically significant (P=0.053, Fig. 6).
Discussion
HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and chronic cholangitis 
contribute to the majority of the 70,000 ICC cases emerg￾ing in China [1], revealing the heterogeneity of Chinese 
cases with those of Westerners and South East Asians. 
Multiple studies have investigated the molecular profiles 
of cholangiocarcinoma in Western countries, but genetic 
information for Chinese patients with ICC is lacking. In 
this study, 417 cancer-associated genes from 122 ICC 
patient samples were subjected to NGS, and a genetic 
profile was obtained. TP53, KRAS and ARID1A were

identified as commonly occurring genetic alterations, 
similar to the results of the present study (Table 4).
Genomic alterations, mostly rearrangements, in FGFR2 
are commonly reported in cholangiocarcinoma patients 
in Western countries [14, 15], and these alterations 
result in constitutive activation of the FGFR2 receptor. 
In this study, a much lower FGFR2 alteration rate (2%) 
was detected in the Chinese population compared with 
that in other populations. Patients with FGFR fusion 
could benefit from BGJ398 and derazantinib treatment, 
and prospective clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy 
of multiple anti-FGFR treatments on cholangiocarci￾noma (NCT04093362/NCT02924376/NCT03773302/
NCT04238715/NCT02150967/NCT03230318/
NCT03656536/NCT04088188).
ERBB2 amplifications are relatively rare in ICC com￾pared with other types of biliary tract cancer (BTC) [16]. 
Due to low mortality and the number of patients with 
specific ERBB2 amplifications, a previous clinical trial 
(NCT00478140) was halted. The frequency of ERBB2 
amplification in this study was 8%, which is higher than 
that previously reported by other studies16. Notably, the 
disease control rate among eight patients who received 
anti-ERBB2 treatment with trastuzumab reached 7/8, 
and one patient achieved a clinically resectable sta￾tus. The therapeutic efficacy of anti-ERBB2 agents on 
ERBB2-amplified ICCs has not been previously reported, 
but phase II trials in China and South Korea are set to 
evaluate the combination of gemcitabine-based chemo￾therapy with trastuzumab in cases of ERBB2-amplified 
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder can￾cer (NCT02836847) and BTC (NCT03613168). Basket 
and multicenter trials may evaluate this treatment more 
adequately.
Cholangiocarcinoma patients with BRCA1/2 muta￾tions treated with PARP inhibitors exhibited a favorable 
response [17]. The predictive features of germline and 
somatic mutations remain to be elucidated, and the ger￾mline versus somatic mutation ratio in this study was 
2:12. In this study, only four patients accepted olapa￾rib treatment, mostly due to economic factors. A recent 
study demonstrated that the accumulation of 2-hydroxy￾glutarate in association with isocitrate dehydrogenase 
(IDH) mutations can suppress homologous recombina￾tion and thereby induce sensitivity to PARP inhibitors 
[18]. These findings provided the foundation for a trial 
exploring the antitumoral activity of olaparib in solid 
tumors that harbor IDH1/2 mutations (NCT03212274). 
Fig. 4 PFS was 15.4 months in the bevacizumab group and 6.7 months in the chemotherapy group (P=0.04)

Wang et al. J Transl Med (2020) 18:273 Page 8 of 11
IDH1/2 alterations are frequently reported in ICC, and 13 
(11%) patients with IDH1 mutations and 6 (5%) patients 
with IDH2 mutations were included in this study. Ongo￾ing studies are evaluating the IDH1 inhibitors ivosidenib 
(NCT02989857) and BAY 1436032 (NCT02746081) 
in BTC. However, because these IDH inhibiters are not 
available at our center, our patients did not have the 
opportunity to receive anti-IDH treatments.
In this study, compared with those in the chemother￾apy alone group, the partial response and stable disease 
rates were higher and the PFS time was longer in cetuxi￾mab treated patients; however, the differences were not 
statistically significant. These results were obtained from 
patients with wild-type KRAS/NRAS/BRAF genes. Both 
NRAS and BRAF were altered in 3 (2%) patients, and 
this rate was much lower than that of KRAS alterations 
(31 patients, 25%). Previous clinical trials indicated that 
EGFR inhibitors, including cetuximab and erlotinib, do 
not improve the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine￾based chemotherapy, although they are well tolerated 
[19, 20]. One study indicated that the KRAS status was 
not associated with PFS in cholangiocarcinoma patients 
treated with both gemcitabine and cetuximab, but the 
patient sample number was limited [21]. A phase II study 
reported that panitumumab combined with gemcitabine 
and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) had a good therapeutic effi￾cacy in KRAS wild-type patients, who exhibited a good 
survival time [22]. Our results support further investiga￾tions of the administration of EGFR inhibiters to KRAS 
wild-type patients.
The disease control rate (85%) and response rate (60%) 
achieved with bevacizumab treatment combined with 
chemotherapy in this study as well as the prolonged 
PFS time (15.4  months) are encouraging. The survival 
data of patients treated with this combination were

significantly better than those of patients in the chemo￾therapy group. Moreover, two of the patients exhibited 
complete responses, and 10 patients underwent hepa￾tectomy after systemic therapy. However, the evidence 
for adding bevacizumab to gemcitabine-based first-line 
chemotherapy is still insufficient and comparatively 
weak. Zhu et al. assessed the efficacy of bevacizumab in 
combination with GEMOX in 35 patients with advanced 
BTCs, and the reported PFS rate at 6  months was 63%, 
which was satisfactory but below the targeted rate of 70% 
[23]. Iyer et al. explored the efficacy of bevacizumab com￾bined with gemcitabine-capecitabine in 50 patients with 
advanced BTCs, reporting a PFS time of 8.1 months, an 
OS time of 10.2 months and a clinical benefit rate of 72% 
[24]. However, concluding that the addition of bevaci￾zumab improved outcomes was not possible based on 
the results. A controlled clinical trial reported longer 
PFS times in the bevacizumab combination group 
(6.48 months) than in the GEMOX group (3.72 months) 
[25]. There are cases of ICCs being successfully treated 
with bevacizumab combined with oxaliplatin-based 
chemotherapies as a consequence of misdiagnosed colo￾rectal carcinoma liver metastasis [26, 27]. Evidence sup￾porting neoadjuvant or conversional treatment in ICC is 
lacking, but our results showed that late staged patients 
accepted combination of chemotherapy and bevacizumab 
treatment and consecutive operation had a longer PFS 
time than those underwent radical surgery. Patients may 
benefit from pre-operation systemic treatment. Thus, 
bevacizumab is an underutilized target agent for ICCs, 
and its efficacy and safety should be further evaluated.
The reported frequency of MSI-H in cholangiocar￾cinoma patients ranges widely from 1% to 10% [28, 
Fig. 6 Overall, patients who received targeted or immunotherapy agents had a longer PFS than those who received chemotherapy (19.3 vs 
6.7 months, P=0.053)

29], and a prospective study reported an MSI-H rate of 
0.5% in unselected cholangiocarcinoma patients [14]. 
In this study, the MSI-H rate was 2% in ICC patients; 
both patients accepted immunotherapy with pembroli￾zumab, and the therapeutic efficacy was satisfactory. 
The FDA approved pembrolizumab for the treatment 
of MSI-H/mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors, 
which showed a predictive response to immunotherapy 
with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors [30]. The KEYNOTE16 
phase II study reported a 100% disease control rate for 4 
MSI-H cholangiocarcinoma patients who received pem￾brolizumab [6], and ongoing clinical trials are access￾ing immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy 
(NCT03111732) or radiotherapy (NCT03898895) for 
the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. Additionally, a 
trial has been designed that combines a PD-1 antibody, 
a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI, lenvatinib) and GEMOX 
for the treatment of ICCs (NCT0395197). All studies 
accessing the therapeutic efficacies of TKIs (including 
the multitarget TKIs cabozantinib [31], vandetanib [32], 
sorafenib [33]; the panErbB family receptor TKI afatinib 
[34]; the VEGF family receptor TKI cediranib [35]; and 
the combination of pazopanib and trametinib [36]) failed 
to show survival improvements. The use of checkpoint 
inhibitor and TKIs in combination may bring hope to 
patients with ICC.
This study was retrospective, which limits its evidence 
grade. However, we herein integrated the genetic profiles 
of ICC patients in the Chinese population. To our knowl￾edge, this is the largest study on the use of NGS results as 
a reference for selecting target/immune therapies.
Conclusions
The therapeutic efficacies of personalized treatments are 
encouraging. Notably, anti-VEGF therapy showed prom￾ising improvements in regards to tumor response and 
patient survival rates. In summary, patients can benefit 
from NGS customized therapy, and further investigations 
are crucial for future strategies.
