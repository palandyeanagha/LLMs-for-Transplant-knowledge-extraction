The Oxidant Stress of Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia Editorial
Over 25 years ago, McCully reported that elevated plasma ho￾mocyst(e)ine concentrations can cause atherosclerotic vascular
disease (1). His postmortem analysis of several patients with
elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine due to rare inborn errors of
metabolism showed severe atherosclerosis. Abundant epide￾miologic evidence has since confirmed McCully’s original hy￾pothesis, with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine concentrations
conferring an independent, increased risk for coronary, cere￾brovascular, and peripheral vascular atherosclerotic disease
(2, 3).
Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid formed
during the metabolism of methionine. Once synthesized, ho￾mocysteine may undergo remethylation to methionine in a re￾action catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate homocysteine
methyltransferase (methionine synthetase), which uses methyl￾tetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor and cobalamin as an essen￾tial cofactor (4). Alternatively, homocysteine can enter the
transsulfuration pathway when cysteine synthesis is required
or in the presence of excess methionine. In this pathway, ho￾mocysteine first condenses with serine to form cystathionine in
a rate-limiting reaction catalyzed by cystathionine-b-synthase
and requiring pyridoxal 59-phosphate; cystathionine-g-lyase
then catalyzes the hydrolysis of cystathionine to yield a-keto￾butyrate and cysteine in another reaction requiring pyridoxal
59-phosphate.
Several genetic disorders have been associated with hy￾perhomocyst(e)inemia, including a deficiency of cystathio￾nine-b-synthase, a mutation that confers thermolability to 5,
10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and a deficiency of
methylenetetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase.
Cystathionine-b-synthase deficiency, an autosomal recessive
trait, is the most common identifiable cause of hyperho￾mocyst(e)inemia. Individuals homozygous for a deficiency of
this enzyme are rare (1;200,000 births) and develop athero￾thrombotic vascular disease in childhood and adolescence that
is frequently fatal (5).
In the general population, hyperhomocyst(e)inemia has
proven to be much more common than originally believed,
with an estimated prevalence of 1;70. This high prevalence
was appreciated only recently owing to the development of a
methionine challenge test (6). Among patients with cere￾brovascular, coronary, or peripheral atherosclerosis, hyperho￾mocyst(e)inemia is found in up to 40% of individuals (7).
More recent data also suggest that deficiencies of vitamin
cofactors required for homocysteine metabolism, namely
folate, pyridoxine, and cobalamin, can promote hyperho￾mocyst(e)inemic atherothrombosis. Selhub and colleagues
have argued that most individuals with increased plasma ho￾mocyst(e)ine concentrations have inadequate concentrations
of one or more of these vitamins (8), an observation supported
by the recent study of Robinson and colleagues with respect to
pyridoxal 59-phosphate (9). Vitamin supplementation has been
shown to reduce or normalize elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine
levels (10, 11), although the benefits of vitamin therapy with
respect to clinical end points have not yet been prospectively
evaluated.
In this context, the report by Ubbink and colleagues (12) in
this edition of The Journal extends the initial observations on
the role of pyridoxine in homocysteine metabolism in an inter￾esting and cleverly designed clinical study. These investigators
examined the effects of a selective deficiency of pyridoxal
59-phosphate on plasma homocyst(e)ine levels after an oral
methionine challenge. This deficiency occurred in asthmatic
individuals chronically treated with theophylline, a competi￾tive inhibitor of pyridoxal kinase (13). They observed in these
individuals with normal folate and vitamin B-12 concentra￾tions that theophylline treatment led to significantly higher
plasma homocyst(e)ine and serum cystathionine concentra￾tions after methionine challenge compared with controls. 6 wk
of pyridoxine supplementation improved these abnormal re￾sponses to methionine challenge, presumably by effectively re￾storing plasma concentrations of pyridoxal sufficient to com￾pete effectively with plasma theophylline concentrations. This
observation provides the first compelling evidence that sub￾normal concentrations of pyridoxal 59-phosphate alone can in￾duce methionine intolerance, an independent risk factor for
homocyst(e)ine-induced atherothrombotic disease. In view of
the recent report that smokers have significantly lower plasma
pyridoxal 59-phosphate concentrations than nonsmokers (14),
results of this study have potential implications for a large seg￾ment of the population of patients at risk for atherosclerosis,
and, perhaps, even more so for those smokers with reactive
airways disease treated with methylxanthines.
In another related report in this edition of The Journal,
Lentz and co-workers (15) examined the effects of hyperho￾mocyst(e)inemia on vascular function in a primate model.
Both clinical observations (5) and animal studies (16) clearly
indicate the adverse consequences of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia
on vascular structure; however, the effects of elevated levels of
plasma homocyst(e)ine on endothelial function and vascular
responses have not heretofore been investigated in an in vivo
model without underlying vascular disease. These investiga￾tors demonstrated that diet-induced hyperhomocyst(e)inemia
led to blunted responses of resistance vessels to endothelium￾dependent vasodilators, and that this effect was accompanied
by depressed thrombomodulin activity and moderately re￾duced vascular smooth muscle responses to nitrovasodilators
when vessels were studied ex vivo. These data support the im￾plications of the study by Celermajer and colleagues (17), who
demonstrated impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilator
function in homozygous hyperhomocyst(e)inemics, and the
study by Van den Berg and co-workers (18), who demon￾strated abnormal endothelial antithrombotic function in
young, mildly hyperhomocyst(e)inemic individuals with pe￾ripheral arterial occlusive disease. In both of these studies,
however, the investigators could not distinguish between ho￾mocysteine and frank atherosclerosis as the basis for endothe￾lial dysfunction. The data by Lentz and colleagues, by contrast,
provide the first compelling evidence for the pathophysiologic

6 J. Loscalzo
effects of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia in vivo in the absence of
structural vascular disease.
It is instructive to consider in more detail the potential mo￾lecular and cellular mechanisms by which hyperhomocyst(e)in￾emia evokes abnormal vascular responses, both from an his￾toric perspective and in light of more recent experimental
data. Homocysteine can be viewed as the first risk factor for
atherosclerosis believed to exert its effects through a mecha￾nism involving oxidative damage (19, 20). Homocysteine is
readily oxidized when added to plasma, principally as a conse￾quence of auto-oxidation leading to the formation of homocys￾tine, homocysteine-mixed disulfides, and homocysteine thi￾olactone. During oxidation of the sulfhydryl group, superoxide
anion radical (O ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are gener￾ated, and these oxygen-derived molecules are believed to ac￾count for the endothelial cytotoxicity of homocyst(e)ine. That
oxidant stress is induced in vivo by hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is
indicated by the decrease in plasma cysteine with an accompa￾nying increase in plasma cystine concentrations (21). O and
hydroxyl radical (OH.
) generated during oxidation of ho￾mocysteine initiate lipid peroxidation, an effect that occurs
both at the endothelial cell surface as well as within lipoprotein
particles in plasma (22). Heinecke and colleagues have sug￾gested that cystine is necessary for the production of O by
vascular cells and their ability to oxidize low-density lipopro￾tein (23).
Upon exposure to homocyst(e)ine, endothelial dysfunction
occurs at several levels. The normal antithrombotic endothe￾lium is converted to a more prothrombotic phenotype with in￾creased Factor V and Factor XII activity, decreased protein C
activation with accompanying inhibition of thrombomodulin
expression, induction of tissue factor expression, and suppres￾sion of heparan sulfate expression. Homocyst(e)ine also re￾duces the binding of tissue-type plasminogen activator to its
endothelial cell receptor, annexin II. All of these changes have
as their final common action facilitation of the generation of
thrombin.
The vasodilator properties of the normal endothelial cell
are also altered by homocyst(e)ine, specifically with respect to
endothelial nitric oxide (NO·
) production. We have shown
previously that normal endothelial cells detoxify homocysteine
by releasing nitric oxide or a related S-nitrosothiol which, in
turn, leads to the formation of S-nitroso-homocysteine (24).
With exposure to homocysteine, endothelial cells first respond
by increasing their production of S-nitrosothiols, including
S-nitroso-homocysteine. In addition, this increase in S-nitroso￾homocysteine appears to be accompanied by an increase in
steady state Nos3 mRNA levels in the endothelial cell. S-Nitro￾sation of homocysteine attenuates its pathogenicity by inhibit￾ing sulfhydryl-dependent generation of H2O2
; in addition, as
with other S-nitrosothiols, S-nitroso-homocysteine is a potent
vasodilator and platelet inhibitor. This protective action of
NO·
, however, is eventually overcome by chronic exposure of
the endothelial cell to hyperhomocyst(e)inemia. Increasingly
compromised production of NO·
 ultimately leads to unop￾posed homocyst(e)ine-mediated oxidative injury to the endo￾thelium.
Sulfhydryl compounds, such as homocysteine, are believed
to attenuate endothelial production of bioactive nitric oxide
through the reaction of O generated during their auto-oxida￾tion (25) with NO·
, resulting in the formation of the adduct
peroxynitrite (OONO2). Thus, despite the increased produc￾H2
H2
H2
H2
tion of NO·
 after homocysteine exposure, less bioactive NO·
 is
available owing to its inactivation by O produced during ho￾mocysteine’s oxidation. This mechanism likely accounts for
the results of Lentz and colleagues reported here in which en￾dothelium-dependent vasodilator responses were attenuated
following homocyst(e)ine exposure in a primate model (15).
In addition to the protection, albeit weak, afforded the en￾dothelium by enhanced NO·
 production in response to ho￾mocyst(e)ine exposure, other protective mechanisms exist in
the vasculature to attenuate the oxidative injury evoked by this
amino acid. Although thiol auto-oxidation generates O ,
H2O2
, and OH.
, it is primarily H2O2
 (and derived OH·
) that has
been implicated in the vascular toxicity of hyperhomocyst(e)in￾emia. Once formed, H2O2
 freely crosses cell membranes and is
efficiently reduced to water by catalase or by glutathione per￾oxidases. While the former is quite catalytically efficient, its
Km for H2O2
 is two to three orders of magnitude weaker than
that for the glutathione peroxidases. In addition and of impor￾tance, catalase cannot reduce lipid peroxides but the glu￾tathione peroxidases can.
The antioxidant enzyme family, the glutathione peroxi￾dases, catalyzes the reduction of both hydrogen and lipid per￾oxides to their corresponding alcohols in a reaction mecha￾nism that involves the oxidation of glutathione. Three isoforms
of the enzyme have been identified thus far, an erythrocytic
isoform, as well as intracellular and extracellular isoforms,
both of which are selenocysteine-containing proteins. We have
shown recently that by reducing these peroxides to alcohols,
glutathione peroxidase prevents inactivation of NO·
 (26). We
have also shown recently that homocyst(e)ine both inhibits
glutathione peroxidase activity in vitro and leads to a dramatic
reduction in steady state mRNA levels for the intracellular iso￾form in endothelial cells; importantly, these effects occur at
concentrations of homocysteine that are pathophysiologically
relevant and are not produced by cysteine (27). That the inhi￾bition of glutathione peroxidase is unique to homocysteine
compared with other biologic thiols may provide an explana￾tion for the unique vascular toxicity of homocysteine and the
lack of toxicity of cysteine, an amino acid present in plasma at
a concentration at least three- to fourfold greater than that of
homocysteine and equally capable of generating O during
auto-oxidation. In conjunction with this reduction in intracel￾lular glutathione peroxidase message and enzyme activity, ho￾mocysteine also significantly decreases the thiol redox state of
vascular cells, as measured by the ratio [GSH]/[GSSG],
through oxidation of GSH (28); in so doing, a relative defi￾ciency of cosubstrate for glutathione peroxidase develops, fur￾ther impairing endothelial oxidative defense mechanisms and
potentiating peroxyl radical–mediated NO·
 inactivation with
resulting endothelial dysfunction. Recently we identified a
family with a deficiency of extracellular glutathione peroxi￾dase, which was accompanied by a dramatic impairment of
NO·
-mediated platelet inhibition and a thrombotic disorder (26).
As one final measure of the effects of homocyst(e)ine￾induced endothelial dysfunction, it is useful to consider the ef￾fects of endothelial-derived NO·
 on vascular smooth muscle
proliferation. Normal endothelial NO·
 impairs underlying vas￾cular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation; however,
homocyst(e)ine itself also leads to vascular smooth muscle cell
proliferation in vitro, in part by a mechanism involving in￾creased cyclin D1
 and cyclin A mRNA expression (29). This ef￾fect may, in part, account for the abnormal response to exoge￾H2

The Oxidant Stress of Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia 7
nous nitrovasodilators in the study by Lentz and colleagues
(15); alternatively, one can argue that the oxidative stress im￾parted by hyperhomocyst(e)inemia can inactivate exogenous
nitrovasodilators equally well as it inactivates endothelial NO·
.
Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia has evolved from a unique, rela￾tively rare mechanism for atherothrombosis to a remarkably
common disorder in the general atherosclerotic population. Its
association with oxidative stress in the vasculature, with vita￾min deficiency states, and with endothelial dysfunction all
serve to cast this interesting disorder in terms consonant with a
contemporary understanding of the complex pathogenesis of
atherothrombotic vascular disease.
