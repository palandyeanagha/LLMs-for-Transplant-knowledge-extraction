BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sixty-four-section CT scanners have recently been introduced for vas￾cular imaging. Before such scanners reach widespread use, scanning protocol should be optimized and
image quality assessed. The goals of this study were to systematically measure image quality and
determine the prevalence of various types of artifacts produced by a 64-section scanner.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed CT angiography (CTA) scans obtained on a
64-section CT scanner in 100 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department during a
2-month period with a suspected acute cerebrovascular event. We evaluated scan quality by using 2
different methods: First, we quantitatively assessed arterial opacification by measuring attenuation
values in 9 arterial segments from the aortic arch to the distal cervical internal carotid artery, by using
a threshold of 150 HU as an indicator of good opacification. Second, we assessed image contrast
between arteries and veins by measuring attenuation within venous segments and recording the
number of artery-vein-segment pairs in which the attenuation difference was 50 HU. In addition, we
recorded the prevalence of the following artifacts: metallic hardware streak, contrast material streak
from slow-flowing contrast material in adjacent large veins, streak artifacts from shoulders, contrast
material reflux into veins of the neck, motion artifacts, and artifacts causing misrepresentation of flow
dynamics simulating arterial dissection or occlusion. These results were compared with those of a
historical control group of 113 patients from our institution who were imaged with the same technical
parameters on a 16-section CT scanner.
RESULTS: The quantitative assessment of arterial opacification showed that 854 of 885 analyzed
arterial segments (96.5%) had good opacification (ie, attenuation values 150 HU). Image contrast
between artery and vein segments was also good, with 714 of 763 analyzable segment pairs (85.6%)
having 50 HU difference. Artifacts obscuring arterial evaluation included streak from contrast material
in the subclavian/brachiocephalic vein (32% of patients), attenuation of the x-ray beam between the
shoulders (28%), beam-hardening from metallic hardware (26%), and contrast material reflux into neck
veins (16%). The most clinically relevant artifacts were flow artifacts, mimicking dissection or vascular
occlusion; they were seen in 14% of patients and likely are related to the rapid data acquisition for CTA
on 64-section scanners (compared with the circulation of contrast material in the cervical arteries).
None of the patients in our historical control group who underwent 16-section CT had flow artifacts on
their CTA studies; the incidence of the other types of artifacts in this group was similar to that in
patients imaged with 64-section CT.
CONCLUSIONS: The 64-section CTA imaging protocol for carotid arteries yields high-quality studies in
95% of cases.
I
n the acute emergency department setting, there is increas￾ing reliance on CT angiography (CTA) for triage and evalu￾ation of patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. In
patients with symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack,
CTA can swiftly and accurately assess the patency of the intra￾cranial circulation, evaluate for carotid atherosclerosis as a
potential embolic source, and provide information about ves￾sel occlusion that is essential before treatment with thrombol￾ysis or even embolectomy is considered.1-3 The wide availabil￾ity, relative safety in acute urgent settings, and speed of CTA,
which is accessible anytime day or night, make it preferable to
MR imaging/MR angiography as a first-line diagnostic tool for
patients in the emergency department suspected of having
acute cerebrovascular events.
Furthermore, CTA image quality has benefited during the
past decade from the steady stream of improvements of multi￾detector CT scanners introduced by commercial vendors,
from single-detector-row to 4-, 8- and 16-section scanners.
Sixty-four-section scanners were first introduced in 2004 and
have become increasingly popular in clinical use, reflecting
current state-of-the-art stroke CTA imaging. Sixty-four￾section CTA from the aortic arch through the intracranial ves￾sels can be performed in 3–4 seconds at submillimeter isotro￾pic resolution with superb-quality multiplanar reformats, but
image quality benefits from a dedicated acquisition protocol
to address the new challenges of fast CT scanning.
In particular, correct timing of the contrast material bolus
to ensure good arterial opacification and high CTA image
quality becomes even more important with 64-section CT
scanners, in which the rapid CT acquisition can outpace the
flow of contrast-opacified blood. Given the increased adop￾Received April 21, 2009; accepted after revision June 4.

tion of 64-section CTA, the purpose of this article is to describe
our recommended carotid CTA imaging protocol for 64-
section scanners, evaluate our initial results, and discuss po￾tential pitfalls and artifacts, some of which may be unique to
64-section CTA.
Materials and Methods
Overview of Stroke Protocol
The 64-section stroke CT protocol used at our institution as the stan￾dard of care for each patient suspected of having stroke (64-section
LightSpeed Volume CT; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) con￾sists of 4 series obtained in the following order: 1) unenhanced head
CT, 2) perfusion CT performed at 2 levels in the brain, 3) CTA from
the base of the heart through the cerebral vertex, and 4) contrast￾enhanced head CT.
Following the unenhanced head CT, perfusion CT is performed at
2 levels, that of the third ventricle and again more cephalad at a point
above the lateral ventricles. At each level, 40-mL iodinated contrast
material (iohexol, Omnipaque 350 mg I/mL; GE Healthcare) fol￾lowed by 25-mL saline is administered, and a series of dynamic low￾dose scans (80 kV, 100 mA) is obtained during injection. Contrast
material is injected at 5 mL/s, the same rate used for CTA.
Dynamic scanning during contrast material injection not only
generates data for perfusion CT analysis but also serves as a timing
bolus to calculate scanning delay between intravenous injection and
contrast arrival in the neck and brain for CTA. At the first perfusion
CT level, arterial enhancement is plotted against time by using a re￾gion of interest placed in a branch of the anterior cerebral artery by the
technologist. The time-to-peak enhancement of the arterial time￾enhancement curve is determined for each patient (usually around 8
seconds) and added to the standard delay between time from contrast
material injection to initiation of perfusion CT scanning (7 seconds),
yielding a total scanning delay of 15 seconds following initiation of
contrast injection in this example. One second is then empirically
deducted from the scanning delay (14 seconds in this example) be￾cause opacification will occur slightly earlier in the cervical carotid
arteries compared with the region of interest placed over a branch of
the intracranial circulation evaluated by the timing-bolus technique.
Patients with impaired cardiac function, atrial fibrillation, or signifi￾cant vascular stenoses will usually have longer time-to-peak arterial
enhancement and thus longer scanning delays than otherwise
healthy patients.
Once the appropriate scanning delay has been determined, CTA
is performed with 70-mL iodinated contrast material (iohexol,
Omnipaque 350 mg I/mL) followed by a 25-mL saline bolus chaser at
5-mL/s injection rate. Scanning parameters for CTA are as follows:
number of detectors, 64; gantry rotation time, 0.4 seconds; caudo￾cranial acquisition; collimation, 0.625 mm; pitch, 0.984:1; 120 kV;
200 – 400 mA; dose modulation with noise index of 12. Sections are
reconstructed at 1.25-mm thickness with a 1-mm reconstruction in￾terval for evaluation of the vasculature, while the 0.625-mm raw data
images are used to create maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) im￾ages. Sections are also reconstructed at 2.5-mm thickness with a
2-mm reconstruction interval for evaluation of soft tissues. Finally,
contrast-enhanced head CT is performed approximately 1 minute
after CTA (without the need for additional contrast material injection
because contrast material has already been administered for perfusion
CT and CTA). This provides additional information regarding inci￾dental lesions, subacute infarctions, contrast extravasation in cases of
intracranial hematoma or aneurysm rupture, and a delayed view of
vessels that appear occluded on initial CTA. The total amount of
contrast material is 150 mL (2  40 mL for CT perfusion and 70 mL
for CTA). The total duration of the examination from start to finish is
approximately 8 minutes.
For contrast material infusion, an 18-gauge intravenous catheter
is typically used. The right arm is preferentially selected whenever
possible to avoid streak artifacts in the mediastinum from contrast
material retained in the left subclavian vein with a left-arm injection.
These artifacts are frequently encountered in elderly patients when
the brachiocephalic vein is compressed between the sternum and an
ectatic aorta arch. The antecubital fossa is preferred for intravenous
access over arm-vein access, which in turn is preferable to hand-vein
access.
Postprocessing is performed by the technologist at the scanner or
in the 3D laboratory. MIP images are obtained of the level of the circle
of Willis in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes; of the carotid bifurca￾tions bilaterally in sagittal oblique planes; and of the origins of the
great vessels and extracranial carotid arteries in the coronal plane.
Additional computer-aided analysis of the degree of carotid artery
stenosis is undertaken by using the North American Symptomatic
Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria, in accordance with Medicare
reimbursement.4
Patient Population
This was a retrospective study performed under the auspices of the
institutional review board at our hospital. Patients were included in
the study under a waiver of informed consent. We reviewed stroke CT
studies of 100 consecutive patients who presented to the emergency
department and underwent the 64-section CT stroke protocol de￾scribed above between August 11, 2007, and October 4, 2007 (48 men,
52 women; mean age, 65.5 years; age range, 23–98 years). Indications
for stroke protocol included suspected stroke in 82 patients, sus￾pected transient ischemic attack in 11, and suspected carotid artery
dissection in 7. All CTA studies and contrast-enhanced CT scans were
reviewed; unenhanced and perfusion CT scans were not evaluated for
this study.
Measurement of Opacification of Artery and
Vein Segments
For each CTA study, the side of contrast material injection (right or
left) was recorded. Most CTA examinations (n  63) were performed
with contrast material injected into the right arm. The quality of ar￾terial opacification was assessed by 1 radiologist (J.J.K.) with 6 years of
experience in evaluating stroke CTA, who measured attenuation in
Hounsfield units at 9 locations: ascending aorta (at the level of the
main pulmonary artery bifurcation), right and left proximal common
carotid arteries (CCAs, at the level of the inferior aspect of the cricoid
cartilage), right and left distal CCAs (at the level of the hyoid bone),
right and left proximal internal carotid arteries (ICAs, just beyond the
carotid bifurcation), and right and left distal cervical ICAs (at the level
of the anterior arch of C1).
Attenuation values of the veins at 9 corresponding locations were
also noted; measurements were made in the superior vena cava and
internal jugular vein (IJV) on each side adjacent to the arterial mea￾surement. To obtain the attenuation value, a circular region of inter￾est (of the greatest diameter that would fit in the vessel lumen) was
drawn on axial images in the center of the lumen. The typical size for
such regions of interest was 20 mm2
. The mean, SD, and maximum
and minimum attenuation values were recorded for each arterial and

venous location. Based on a review of the literature, we deemed arte￾rial attenuation values 150 HU be optimal for CTA5,6 and counted
the number of arterial segments with attenuation values 150 HU.
To evaluate the degree of image contrast between arteries and veins,
we calculated the difference in attenuation between artery and vein
for each considered level. On the basis of a similar analysis by Rubin et
al6 of attenuation differences between arteries and veins and the re￾quirements of intensity-based software for 3D rendering purposes, we
considered that a threshold difference of 50 HU between arterial
and venous attenuation was optimal, and the number of segments
with 50 HU attenuation difference between arteries and corre￾sponding veins was recorded.
Recording of Artifacts
A single observer (J.J.K.) recorded artifacts that caused partial or sig￾nificant obscuration of adjacent arteries and assigned them to 1 of the
following categories: 1) metallic hardware streak (eg, in the upper
chest from cardiac pacer leads or in the neck from dental hardware);
2) streak artifacts of venous origin (ie, slow-flowing contrast material
in the subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein, and/or superior vena
cava obscuring the origins of great vessels); 3) streak artifacts between
the shoulders from photon starvation; 4) contrast material reflux into
small neck veins (ie, contrast in the vertebral venous plexus obscuring
the adjacent vertebral artery), 5) motion, and 6) flow artifacts or mis￾representation of flow dynamics (eg, pseudodissection or pseudo￾occlusion). Also, the degree of contrast material reflux into the IJV
was determined by measuring the caudocranial length of reflux into
the IJV from the confluence of the IJV and the brachiocephalic vein as
depicted on a coronal MIP image. The side of contrast material injec￾tion was compared with the extent of contrast material reflux into the
IJV by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for nonparametric data.
Historical Control Group
We compared the quality of arterial opacification and the incidence of
artifacts on 64-section CTA examinations with those on 16-section
studies by using a historic control group of patients from our institu￾tion who had been previously studied and published.7 This control
group consisted of 113 consecutive patients over a 2-year period who
were suspected of having acute hemispheric stroke and underwent
stroke protocol imaging on a 16-section scanner, consisting of unen￾hanced CT, perfusion CT, CTA, and delayed contrast-enhanced CT.
Scanning parameters, including contrast dose and determination of
scanning delay by test bolus technique (by using perfusion CT), were
the same in this group as for the 64-section CTA. The quality of
arterial opacification and incidence of artifacts between these patient
groups were compared by using the Fisher exact test.
Results
Quantitative Assessment of Arterial Opacification on
Carotid CTA
Of 900 possible arterial segments (ie, 9 locations in 100 pa￾tients), 885 segments (98.3%) were included in the analysis; 15
segments were excluded because of arterial occlusion as deter￾mined by qualitative assessment of the CTA. In general, the
intensity of arterial opacification on CTA was high through￾out, with mean arterial attenuation averaged across all seg￾ments equal to 309.9  92.6 HU. Figure 1 charts the mean
attenuation  SD for each arterial location. The maximum
arterial attenuation was 600 HU, and the minimum attenua￾tion was 83 HU; 854 of 885 segments (96.5%) had attenuation
150 HU. The 31 measurements with attenuation 150 HU
were obtained in the ascending aorta (n  3), proximal CCA
(n  14), distal CCA (n  2), proximal ICA (n  5), and distal
ICA (n  7).
The quality of arterial opacification achieved on 64-section
CTA was not significantly different from that achieved in our
16-section CTA historical control group. In this control group
of 113 patients and 1012 total arterial segments (9 segments
per patient as in the current study with exclusion of 5 occluded
segments), 967 of 1012 segments (95.5%) had attenuation
150 HU (P  .348 for Fisher exact test).
The side of contrast material injection had no influence on
mean arterial attenuation (P  .838 for the 2-tailed t test).
Quantitative Assessment of Image Contrast between
Arteries and Veins
Of 900 possible venous segments, 778 segments (86.4%) were
considered for analysis. Venous segments containing noncir￾culated undiluted contrast material (all 100 measurements in
the superior vena cava and 22 measurements in the IJV with
contrast material reflux) were excluded. Mean venous opaci￾fication averaged across all segments was 133.8  60.6 HU,
and the mean attenuation difference between artery and vein,
averaged across all locations, was 180.8  88.2 HU. By loca￾tion, attenuation difference was 183.6  82.2 HU in the prox￾imal CCA, 203.1  87.9 HU in the distal CCA, 183.6  85.9
HU in the proximal ICA, and 153.3  89.7 HU in the distal
ICA. The number of artery- and vein-segment pairs with
50-HU attenuation difference was 714 of 763 segments
(85.6%). (Note that the 15 arterial segments with occlusion
were not included in this analysis.) Twenty-three of 49 seg￾ments showing 50 HU attenuation difference were in the
distal neck (distal ICA/IJV at C1), which generally showed the
highest levels of venous opacification.
Artifacts
The prevalence of different types of artifacts encountered on
64-section CTA compared with 16-section CTA is listed in the
Table and illustrated in Fig 2. Most of the artifacts we encoun￾tered caused obscuration of vessels.

of 50 patients (30 of 63 patients with right-sided injections and
20 of 37 patients with left-sided injections). The median length
of reflux measured 1.1 cm (0.80 –2.80 cm for the 25th-75th
percentile, respectively). However, there was no significant
difference between right- and left-sided injections in terms of
median length of reflux in the IJV (P  .745, Wilcoxon rank
sum).
There was no significant difference between 64- and 16-
section CTA in the incidence of artifacts except for those re￾lated to flow dynamics. These artifacts were seen in 14% of
64-section CTA studies but were not present in any of the
16-section CTA studies in our historical control group. Unlike
the artifacts that produced obscuration of vessels, artifacts re￾lated to flow dynamics caused difficulties with assessing the
type of flow within vessels. Two types of artifacts were pro￾duced by flow in the current study (ie, a pseudodissection
appearance and a pseudo-occlusion appearance). These will
be discussed in turn.
One type of artifact produced by flow dynamics simulated
the appearance of arterial dissection. A linear hypoattenuated
stripe was noted within the arterial lumen in 5 cases, which
could have been mistaken for a dissection flap if not evaluated
carefully. All cases involved the carotid artery, 3 of which oc￾curred in the ICA immediately distal to the carotid bifurcation
(Fig 3). These were presumed to be artifacts on the basis of the
faintness of the low-attenuation flap and the typical location
for flow reversal or separation as depicted on Doppler sono￾grams and conventional angiograms (further discussion be￾low). None of these 3 patients had follow-up imaging. How￾ever, 2 patients had similar apparent dissection flaps in other
locations (1 in the proximal CCA [Fig 4] and the other in the
distal CCA extending into both internal and external carotid
arteries). In these cases, the appearance was sufficiently dis￾turbing that subsequent imaging was recommended; neither
patient was found to have dissection.
The second type of flow-related artifacts was one of arterial
pseudo-occlusion. In 6 patients, a portion of vessel was not
opacified and thus was apparently occluded on CTA. How￾ever, these segments were subsequently presumed to be patent
on the basis of opacification on delayed contrast-enhanced
CT. These findings suggest that flow was present but sluggish;
thus, it is likely that the very rapid CTA acquisition outpaced
the relatively slow flow of contrast-opacified blood in these
individuals. While all 6 patients were found to have segments

demonstrate faint linear flap extending vertically from the left carotid bifurcation and the appearance of 2 vascular compartments with different degrees of opacification.

of the proximal right CCA (arrow), disconcerting for dissection. C, Axial T1-weighted image using a fat saturation technique through the cervical carotid artery (arrow), obtained immediately
after the CT study, shows no evidence of dissection. The finding on CTA is considered to represent pulsation artifacts.

of vessel that were occluded, CTA overestimated the extent of
occlusion compared with contrast-enhanced CT (Fig 5). Five
patients had CTA images showing occlusion of variable
lengths in the ICA and middle cerebral artery (MCA); on de￾layed contrast-enhanced CT, however, some portions of the
intracranial and distal cervical ICA that appeared occluded on
CTA showed contrast material filling, with the occlusion
being limited to the ICA terminus or the M1 segment of the
MCA. The sixth patient had a vertebral artery occlusion, the
extent of which was overestimated by CTA compared with
contrast-enhanced CT. Follow-up imaging (1 MR angiogram
and 2 conventional angiograms) was available in 3 patients
to confirm vessel patency; the other 3 patients in whom
follow-up imaging was not available were presumed to have
pseudo-occlusion.
To determine the reason for slow arterial flow causing con￾firmed or presumed pseudo-occlusion on CTA, we reviewed
the entire course of affected arteries to determine if proximal
stenoses caused impedance to flow. Such proximal stenoses
were, in fact, identified in 3 of the 6 patients. Hemodynami￾cally significant proximal stenoses were seen due to athero￾sclerotic narrowing in 2 patients and a type A aortic dissection,
in 1. However, in the remaining 3 patients, no hemodynami￾cally significant proximal stenosis was appreciated but distal
occlusions were noted (MCA occlusion in 1 patient and ca￾rotid terminus occlusions in 2 patients).
Besides causing artifactual occlusion on CTA, distal
thrombosis may also create the appearance of differential at￾tenuation between the right and left carotid arteries through
altered flow dynamics. One patient in our study had a right
MCA territory stroke due to thromboembolism in the M1
segment of the MCA. Rather than nonopacification and
pseudo-occlusion on CTA as in the cases above, the right intra￾cranial ICA showed diffusely decreased attenuation compared
with the left side on CTA (Fig 6). No proximal stenosis was
identified to account for the slower flow and lower attenuation
of the right ICA.
Finally, venous flow artifacts were noted in 3 patients. Sim￾ilar to the cases of arterial pseudo-occlusion and overestima￾tion of occlusion by CTA compared with contrast-enhanced
CT, 1 patient with a right-sided central line showed apparent
thrombosis of the entire ipsilateral IJV on CTA. The visualized
IJV at the skull base on contrast-enhanced CT, however, had
delayed opacification consistent with at least partial patency
and slow blood flow (Fig 7). The other 2 patients had pseudo￾thrombosis of the IJV at the insertion of a smaller vein as it
emptied a column of nonopacified blood into the IJV (Fig 8).
Discussion
The major findings in this study are as follows: First, we
showed that, with the CTA protocol used in this study, very
good arterial opacification and substantial differences in de￾Fig 5. A 79-year-old woman with left hemiparesis. AC, CTA shows nonopacification and apparent occlusion of the entire right ICA, from its origin to the carotid terminus. Compare the
normally opacified left ICA (black arrows) with the nonopacified right side (white arrows in C denote the expected course of the right ICA). D and E, Axial contrast-enhanced images, however,
show opacification and confirm patency of the right ICA at comparable levels. F, Conventional angiogram obtained 4 hours later (anteroposterior [AP] view right carotid injection) confirms
patency of the entire intracranial ICA but reveals an abrupt cutoff of the proximal M1 segment (arrow), consistent with occlusion. Nonopacification on CTA is attributed to the sluggish
flow resulting from the M1 occlusion on the right side.

gree of opacification between arteries and adjacent veins could
be obtained. Second, we identified important artifacts that
may be specific to very fast scanning techniques such as the
64-section multidetector scanner used in this study. In partic￾ular, important artifacts related to flow dynamics produced an
appearance that simulated arterial occlusion and dissection.

with the normal left side (small arrow). B, Axial reformatted MIP image again demonstrates overall decreased attenuation of the right supraclinoid ICA (large black arrow) compared with
the normal left ICA and middle cerebral artery (MCA, small black arrows). A large filling defect is noted in the right MCA (white arrow). C, Angiogram, AP-view right carotid injection,
shows an abrupt cutoff (black arrow) in the right MCA consistent with occlusion. No hemodynamically significant stenoses were observed at the origin or along the course of the right
carotid artery to account for impaired blood flow and decreased arterial attenuation, which was instead attributed to the presence of a distal thrombus.

right internal jugular vein (IJV, arrows) compared with the opacified left IJV (arrowheads). B, Axial source CTA image again shows no contrast in the right IJV (arrow). C, Contrast-enhanced
CT at the same level as B shows delayed contrast filling of the IJV (black arrow), suggesting sluggish flow but patency of the superior IJV at the skull base. More inferior portions of
the IJV in the neck could not be assessed on contrast-enhanced CT, which images only the head, so it is unclear whether the remainder of the IJV was thrombosed or patent but with
slow flow. No follow-up imaging was available in this patient, who had a right central venous catheter (not shown), which may have provided a nidus for thrombosis or impeded venous
drainage causing slow flow.
Fig 8. A 69-year-old woman with venous pseudothrombosis. A, Axial source CTA image shows an apparent eccentric filling defect in the right IJV (arrow). B, Nonopacified blood in a small
vein (black arrow) draining into the IJV is responsible for causing these flow artifacts.

These flow phenomena, while recognizable as artifacts to the
radiologist experienced in interpreting 64-section CTA, could
be a source of potential confusion for those not familiar with
very fast scanning techniques because these artifacts have not
been systematically reviewed or reported in the literature, to
our knowledge. None of these artifacts were seen in our his￾torical control group scanned on 16-section CT. Identification
of these flow artifacts may be important for developing strat￾egies to prevent these artifacts on 64-section scanners and for
developing scanning protocols and interpreting images from
the next generation of scanners using even higher numbers of
CT detectors.
Proper timing of contrast material administration is a key
determinant of optimal arterial opacification and CTA image
quality. With multidetector scanners of up to 16 sections, a
fixed delay (eg, 25 seconds) between contrast material injec￾tion and the start of scanning has been successfully used by
some authors.8 However, given the physiologic variability of
blood flow among patients (especially those with cardiac dys￾function or vascular stenoses) and the very fast imaging times
of 64-section CT, accurately timing the delay between contrast
material administration and scanning initiation with either a
bolus-tracking technique or a preprocedure timing bolus be￾comes important.9-11
In bolus tracking, the main contrast material bolus is in￾jected and then a designated vessel of interest is monitored in
real-time with low-dose dynamic scanning. When a certain
enhancement threshold is reached in the monitored vessel, the
table moves to the start position and scanning begins. The
main drawback of this technique is the inherent delay be￾tween when the threshold value is reached and when scanning
begins (approximately 4 seconds), as well as the delay in com￾puter reconstruction of bolus-tracking images (2 seconds).
The combined 6-second lag often requires that an increased
amount of contrast material be injected.
The timing-bolus approach circumvents this delay intrin￾sic to bolus tracking. In our stroke protocol, the dynamic low
milliampere/kilovolt perfusion CT doubles as the timing￾bolus scan. Because there is no intrinsic delay with the
timing-bolus approach, the volume of contrast material given
for the CTA can be kept as low as possible (70 mL for CTA in
our protocol). With appropriate modifications to optimally
time scanning delay, timing-bolus and bolus-tracking tech￾niques both yield high-quality CTA studies.
In a study that used a phantom model of carotid stenosis
and nonionic contrast material, other authors have shown that
contrast densities between 150 and 200 HU yield the most
accurate assessments of stenoses on CTA.5 With our carotid
CTA protocol, high arterial opacification was achieved in this
study, with a mean arterial attenuation of approximately
310 HU and attenuation values 150 HU in approximately
97% of arterial segments. Because ours was a segmental anal￾ysis of contrast opacification, if studies containing pseudo￾occlusions or pseudodissections had segments with arterial
attenuation 150 HU, these segments were included in the
calculation. Of the 31 arterial segments with attenuation
150 HU, nearly half were found in the proximal CCA, which
is particularly prone to attenuation artifacts between the
shoulders and artifactual lowering of contrast densities. In￾deed, the proximal CCA had the lowest mean attenuation of
all locations. The distal CCA and proximal ICA had the highest
mean attenuation values, which are the sites of greatest clinical
relevance. de Monye´ et al12 had similar carotid artery attenu￾ation values in a study of contrast material volumes and bolus
chaser on 16-section CTA.
Our CTA protocol also minimized contrast opacification
of cervical veins and provided high-attenuation differences
between arteries and veins, with a mean attenuation difference
of approximately 181 HU. Of the segments with poor image
contrast between arterial and venous segments (attenuation
difference 50 HU), nearly half (23 of 49) of the segments
were in the high cervical region, presumably because of greater
time for contrast material circulation given our caudocranial
imaging technique.
We generally attempted to administer intravenous contrast
material from a right-sided injection for 2 reasons. First, the
left brachiocephalic vein takes a more transverse course into
the superior vena cava, which produces a higher likelihood of
undiluted contrast material obscuring the origins of the great
vessels. Second, compression of the brachiocephalic vein by an
ectatic aorta, which is especially common in elderly patients,
who compose a large percentage of patients undergoing CTA
of the carotid arteries, can lead to contrast material pooling
and subsequent reflux into neck veins. Nonetheless, compar￾ison of right- and left-sided injections in our study did not
reveal a significant difference in the extent of streak artifacts
obscuring great vessel origins or median length of reflux in the
IJV. de Monye´ et al13 similarly did not find a significant differ￾ence in streak artifacts or length of IJV reflux between right￾and left-sided injections in patients who underwent caudo￾cranial CTA scanning.
An important finding in our study is that of flow-related
artifacts that mimic arterial dissection or arterial occlusion,
which were observed only on 64-section CTA and not in our
16-section CTA control group. A presumed pseudodissection
flap extending vertically from the dorsal wall of the carotid
bifurcation and toward the proximal ICA was observed in 3
patients. While the precise mechanism underlying this ap￾pearance is not known, we will consider several possible ex￾planations. Several authors describe flow reversal in the
carotid bifurcation at the site where pseudodissection was
most commonly observed in our study. Flow reversal occurs
when laminar flow in the CCA is disrupted as flowing blood
enters a region of increased vessel caliber. Slower flowing
blood at the periphery of the vessel lumen encounters a
larger pressure gradient at the carotid bifurcation, which re￾verses the direction of flow. Flow reversal can appear as a
linear stripe at the periphery of the bifurcation, opposite the
origin of the external carotid artery, and can extend into the
proximal ICA as depicted on color Doppler sonography and
even angiography.14,15
A second type of flow phenomenon mimicking dissection
on MR angiography is described by Saloner et al.16 The au￾thors noted that slower flowing blood at the periphery of the
lumen proximal to a 90° bend becomes rotated into the center
of the lumen by secondary flow and appears as a hypointense
intraluminal stripe on MR angiography. Because faster imag￾ing times are achieved with 64-section CTA, we may discern
complex flow phenomena previously not captured on 4- or
16-section scanners. Alternatively, if we presume that the col￾98 Kim  AJNR 31  Jan 2010  www.ajnr.org

umn of flowing blood within the vessel is uniformly opacified,
perhaps other explanations such as beam-hardening artifacts
at the carotid bulb (related to calcified atherosclerotic plaque)
may account for the linear low-attenuation flap that is seen.
The most common flow artifacts on CTA, pseudo￾occlusion and poor sensitivity to slow flow, were also the
likely result of very fast scanning times because they were not
seen on 16-section CTA. With 64-section CTA, areas of de￾layed blood flow and altered fluid dynamics (secondary to
proximal stenosis, distal thrombosis, or even a central venous
catheter) were rapidly imaged before adequate contrast opaci￾fication could occur. The scanning had “outrun” the contrast
material bolus in areas of slow flow, which were able to opacify
by the time delayed contrast-enhanced CT was performed.
The emphasis of our protocol on obtaining optimal arterial
enhancement on CTA images and minimizing the volume of
contrast material used likely contributed to these flow arti￾facts. As stated earlier, we generally prefer the timing-bolus
approach to bolus tracking because CTA can be performed in
a pure arterial phase, with optimal enhancement of the carotid
and vertebral arteries and minimal enhancement in the cervi￾cal veins. In addition, reducing the overall amount of contrast
material that is administered is particularly important for pa￾tients with impaired or borderline renal function.
There were no cases of patient motion artifacts in our se￾ries, likely as a result of the very fast scanning time (3–4 sec￾onds) afforded by 64-section CTA. While not statistically sig￾nificant, 3 of the 113 studies in the 16-section CTA control
group were affected by motion artifacts. The literature reports
even higher rates of motion artifacts on CTA studies acquired
on slower earlier generation CT scanners, including 5 of 22
cases (22.7%) in 1 study of single-section CTA with a scanning
time of 60 seconds.17
A limitation of our study is the lack of consistent follow-up
imaging in patients with flow-related artifacts. Among the 6
cases of overestimation of arterial occlusion by CTA, only 3
patients had follow-up imaging to verify the assessment made
on contrast-enhanced CT. Future studies might benefit from
greater correlation with other noninvasive imaging techniques
or with subsequent imaging in selected patients.
One consideration that merits some discussion is the radi￾ation dose incurred by patients from our 64-section stroke
protocol, which consists of pre- and postcontrast head CT,
CTA, and perfusion CT. The perfusion CT is performed at a
low radiation dose (80 kV, 100 mA) and doubles as our timing
bolus for CTA. The utility of perfusion CT in the acute stroke
setting for predicting the extent of infarct and clinical outcome
has been demonstrated in multiple studies.18-21 Finally, we
also attempted to minimize the radiation dose to the patient by
performing x-y-z-axis dose modulation on 64-section CT, in
which the tube current applied within each CT section varies
depending on the patient’s attenuation and girth at each level,
while still preserving image quality.22,23 With dose modula￾tion, the radiation dose to the patient from 64-section CTA is
comparable with the dose from unmodulated 16-section
CTA.23 This is important given the concern for increased ra￾diation from obtaining a higher number of very thin sections
on 64-section CT scanners as compared with earlier genera￾tion scanners.
Conclusions
We have validated a CTA protocol suitable for imaging with a
64-section multidetector CT scanner and have identified 2
types of flow-related artifacts that are pronounced by using a
64-section scanner. These artifacts may be particular to very
rapid CT scanning, such as that afforded by a 64-section scan￾ner. Recognition and understanding of these artifacts to avoid
misdiagnosis should be valuable for radiologists who are per￾forming CTA on a 64-section scanner.
