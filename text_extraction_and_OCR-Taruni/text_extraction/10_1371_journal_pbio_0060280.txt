The human intestinal microbiota is essential to the health of the host and plays a role in nutrition, development,
metabolism, pathogen resistance, and regulation of immune responses. Antibiotics may disrupt these coevolved
interactions, leading to acute or chronic disease in some individuals. Our understanding of antibiotic-associated
disturbance of the microbiota has been limited by the poor sensitivity, inadequate resolution, and significant cost of
current research methods. The use of pyrosequencing technology to generate large numbers of 16S rDNA sequence
tags circumvents these limitations and has been shown to reveal previously unexplored aspects of the ‘‘rare
biosphere.’’ We investigated the distal gut bacterial communities of three healthy humans before and after treatment
with ciprofloxacin, obtaining more than 7,000 full-length rRNA sequences and over 900,000 pyrosequencing reads
from two hypervariable regions of the rRNA gene. A companion paper in PLoS Genetics (see Huse et al., doi: 10.1371/
journal.pgen.1000255) shows that the taxonomic information obtained with these methods is concordant.
Pyrosequencing of the V6 and V3 variable regions identified 3,300–5,700 taxa that collectively accounted for over
99% of the variable region sequence tags that could be obtained from these samples. Ciprofloxacin treatment
influenced the abundance of about a third of the bacterial taxa in the gut, decreasing the taxonomic richness, diversity,
and evenness of the community. However, the magnitude of this effect varied among individuals, and some taxa
showed interindividual variation in the response to ciprofloxacin. While differences of community composition
between individuals were the largest source of variability between samples, we found that two unrelated individuals
shared a surprising degree of community similarity. In all three individuals, the taxonomic composition of the
community closely resembled its pretreatment state by 4 weeks after the end of treatment, but several taxa failed to
recover within 6 months. These pervasive effects of ciprofloxacin on community composition contrast with the reports
by participants of normal intestinal function and with prior assumptions of only modest effects of ciprofloxacin on the
intestinal microbiota. These observations support the hypothesis of functional redundancy in the human gut
microbiota. The rapid return to the pretreatment community composition is indicative of factors promoting community
resilience, the nature of which deserves future investigation.

Introduction
Specialized microbial communities inhabit the skin, mu￾cosal surfaces, and gastrointestinal tract of humans (and
other vertebrates) from birth until death, with by far the
largest populations in the colon [1,2]. Humans rely on their
native microbiota for nutrition and resistance to colonization
by pathogens [3–6]; furthermore, recent discoveries have
shown that symbiotic microbes make essential contributions
to the development, metabolism, and immune response of the
host [7–10]. Co-evolved, beneficial, human–microbe interac￾tions can be altered by many aspects of a modern lifestyle,
including urbanization, global travel, and dietary changes [1],
but in particular by antibiotics [11]. The acute effects of
antibiotic treatment on the native gut microbiota range from
self-limiting ‘‘functional’’ diarrhea to life-threatening pseu￾domembranous colitis [12,13]. The long-term consequences
of such perturbations for the human–microbial symbiosis are
more difficult to discern, but chronic conditions such as
asthma and atopic disease have been associated with child￾hood antibiotic use and an altered intestinal microbiota [14–
16]. Because many chemical transformations in the gut are
mediated by specific microbial populations [17], with impli￾cations for cancer [18,19] and obesity [20,21], among other
conditions [22], changes in the composition of the gut
microbiota could have important but undiscovered health
effects. An approximate return to pretreatment conditions
often (but not always) occurs within days or weeks after
cessation of antibiotic treatment, as assessed by subjective
judgments of bowel function and characterizations of overall

community composition using techniques with low phyloge￾netic resolution [23–25]. However, the effects of a single
course of antibiotics on specific microbial populations in vivo
can persist for years [26–28]. Overall, the duration and extent
of antibiotic-induced disturbance throughout the intestinal
microbiota remains poorly characterized, particularly at the
species and strain level where the diversity of the community
is greatest [2,29], and we lack the information to compare
these disturbances to normal temporal variation in commun￾ity composition.
The diversity and abundance of the human microbiota, and
of the gut community in particular, poses a challenge for
researchers investigating changes in community composition
over time. The laborious cultivation-based techniques that
were the mainstay of microbiology for a century have
revealed only a minority of the species that inhabit the
human colon [30,31]. Over the past decade, cultivation￾independent molecular techniques, particularly those based
on the small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene, have
given us a broader and less biased view of the gut microbiota
[32,33]. Full-length 16S rRNA sequences offer the highest
possible degree of taxonomic resolution using this gene, but
the cost of dideoxy Sanger sequencing limits our ability to
survey the less-abundant members of this diverse community.
Studies comparing changes in the gut microbiota over time
or between treatments have often used alternative molecular
techniques that are more rapid and less expensive than
sequencing, but that offer lower taxonomic resolution and
reveal only the more abundant members of the community
[23–25,34–37]. These approaches can be focused more
narrowly on particular taxonomic groups, which facilitates
the investigation of less-abundant taxa, but at the expense of
a broader view of community composition that might reveal
important microbial interactions.
Pyrosequencing ameliorates some of these constraints by
generating a much larger amount of genetic sequence data at
a lower cost [38]. Both with this approach and with the
established approach of clone library sequencing, DNA is
extracted from a sample, and PCR primers complementary to
conserved regions of the 16S rRNA are used to amplify the
intervening variable sequence. The diversity and relative
abundance of 16S rRNA sequence variants in the pool of
amplicons is analyzed as a proxy for the diversity and relative
abundance of the microbial populations in the sample.
Because the gene sequence-based recognition of uncultivated
microbial populations is not equivalent to traditional
taxonomic classification, terms such as ‘‘species’’ or ‘‘strain’’
are not appropriate. Instead, the populations inferred to exist
on the basis of sequence data are referred to as operational
taxonomic units (OTUs), which can be defined in various ways
and at different levels of resolution.
Both the clone library and pyrosequencing approaches can
be affected by biased PCR amplification of microbial
populations in the sample, although the problem is reduced
for the shorter pyrosequencing amplicons [39]. The pyrose￾quencing approach also avoids the cloning bias of the earlier
technique by attaching amplicons individually to beads and
physically separating the beads into picoliter-scale wells on a
specialized plate. Less phylogenetic information is available
from a single pyrosequencing read (at most, ;230 informa￾tive bases with recent technology) than from near full-length
16S rRNA gene sequence (;1,400 bases with commonly used
primers), but reads that span particular variable regions of
the gene are highly informative [40,41]. On the other hand,
well over 200,000 short 16S rRNA sequence reads, which we
refer to as tags, can be obtained in a single run of the Genome
Sequencer FLX System. In comparison, two runs of a state-of￾the-art capillary Sanger sequencer are required to obtain at
most 384 full-length 16S rRNA sequences.
Sogin and his co-workers have demonstrated the power of
pyrosequencing by amplifying the V6 variable region of 16S
rRNA from marine deep water and hydrothermal vent
samples, analyzing over 900,000 bacterial and archaeal tags
from the vent system and revealing greater taxonomic
richness (over 20,000 OTUs observed at 3% sequence
divergence) than has previously been reported for any
microbial habitat [39,42,43]. Roesch et al. followed a similar
strategy using the V9 region to analyze North American soil
samples [40,44], and a group led by Knight have focused on a
longer tag that includes the V2 region in macaque gut
samples and in a mixture of five diverse microbial habitats
[45,46]. Computer simulations by Liu et al. [43], Wang et al.
[41], and Sundquist et al. [47] have indicated that pyrose￾quencing tags from different regions of the gene will vary in
their utility for the distinct tasks of revealing microbial
diversity and performing taxonomic classification, both of
which contribute to making informative comparisons be￾tween complex microbial communities. As with the estab￾lished approach of generating data from clone libraries, the
actual performance of tag pyrosequencing for the goals of a
particular study will depend on the region of the 16S rRNA
gene analyzed, the PCR primers used, and the composition of
the microbial communities in the samples.
In the present study, we used pyrosequencing tags spanning
the V6 and V3 regions as well as full-length 16S rRNA
sequences to analyze the bacterial community composition in
a time series of stool samples obtained from three healthy
adults before, during, and after a short course of the
antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cp). A companion paper [48]
reports a high degree of similarity in the community
composition inferred from the two variable regions and from

Effects of an Antibiotic on Human Gut Microbiota
Author Summary
The intestinal microbiota is essential to human health, with effects
on nutrition, metabolism, pathogen resistance, and other processes.
Antibiotics may disrupt these interactions and cause acute disease,
as well as contribute to chronic health problems, although technical
challenges have hampered research on this front. Several recent
studies have characterized uncultured and complex microbial
communities by applying a new, massively parallel technology to
obtain hundreds of thousands of sequences of a specific variable
region within the small subunit rRNA gene. These shorter sequences
provide an indication of diversity. We used this technique to track
changes in the intestinal microbiota of three healthy humans before
and after treatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, with high
sensitivity and resolution, and without sacrificing breadth of
coverage. Consistent with previous results, we found that the
microbiota of these individuals was similar at the genus level, but
interindividual differences were evident at finer scales. Ciprofloxacin
reduced the diversity of the intestinal microbiota, with significant
effects on about one-third of the bacterial taxa. Despite this
pervasive disturbance, the membership of the communities had
largely returned to the pretreatment state within 4 weeks.

full-length sequences. Here we describe the diversity of
human intestinal bacteria more completely and with more
precision than has previously been possible. Cp has an
extensive and individualized effect on the composition of
these communities, but most members of the community
returned to their pretreatment abundance within weeks.
Methods
Participants, Treatment, and Sampling
Healthy adults who had not taken any antibiotics within the
previous year were recruited to donate stool samples before,
during, and after a short course of ciprofloxacin (Cp) (500 mg
twice a day for 5 d), typical of the treatment prescribed, e.g.,
for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Samples of
approximately 5 g were collected in sterile plastic containers
by the participants themselves and immediately stored in
home freezers until brought to the laboratory (within several
days) for storage at 80 8C. From a larger number of samples
collected, we chose five time points spanning an 8-mo interval
from each of three participants for analyses using full-length
16S rRNA clone libraries and pyrosequencing of the V6
variable region of 16S rRNA. An additional three samples
from one of the participants were analyzed along with the
original 15 samples using V3 tag pyrosequencing. Participant
characteristics and the sampling and analysis regime are
shown in Table 1. For each participant, samples 1 and 2 (1, 2a,
2b, and 2c for individual A) were collected prior to Cp
treatment, sample 3 (3a and 3b for individual A) was the Cp￾associated sample taken during or immediately after treat￾ment, and samples 4 and 5 were more distant post-treatment
samples. Informed consent was obtained from participants,
and the study protocol was approved by the Administrative
Panel for Medical Research on Human Subjects (Institutional
Review Board) of Stanford University.
DNA Extraction
A subsample of approximately 200 mg of frozen stool was
added to a 2.0-ml screwcap vial containing glass beads of 1
mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.1 mm diameter (BioSpec Products), and
kept on ice until the addition of 1.4-ml ASL buffer from the
QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). Samples were
immediately subjected to beadbeating (45 s, setting 4) using
a FastPrep machine (Bio 101) prior to the initial incubation
for heat and chemical lysis at 95 8C for 7 min. Subsequent
steps of the DNA extraction followed the QIAamp kit
protocol. DNA from two separate extractions of each sample
were pooled for molecular analysis. Extraction controls
lacking fecal material but otherwise treated identically were
carried through the entire procedure including PCR ampli￾fication (no bands visible) and attempted cloning of PCR
amplicons, which was unsuccessful.
Full-Length 16S rRNA Sequencing
To amplify near full-length 16S rRNA sequences, 2 ml of
extracted DNA served as the template in 20-ll reactions
containing 1 unit AmpliTaq polymerase (Applied Biosys￾tems), 1x Buffer II, 1.5mM MgCl2, 20mM tetramethylammo￾nium chloride, 5% DMSO, 0.02% Triton X-100, 100 nM of
each dNTP, and 20 nM each of forward and reverse primers
(Integrated DNA Technologies). The forward primer was a
mixture of 90% bacterial primer 8F (59-AGAGTTT￾GATCMTGGCTCAG-39) and 10% 8F-Bif targeting Bifidobac￾teria (59-AGGGTTCGATTCTGGCTCAG-39); it was paired
with the three domain reverse primer 1391R (59-
GACGGGCGGTGTGTRCA-39). Thermocycling involved a 5-
min denaturation at 95 8C followed by 15–22 cycles of 94 8C
(30 s), 55 8C (30 s), and 72 8C (90 s), with a final extension at 72
8C for 8 min. The fewest possible cycles were used to produce
a faint band of the expected size under UV illumination after
electrophoresis of 5-ll reaction product in a 1% agarose
minigel containing 1 mM ethidium bromide. Two 4-cycle, 50-
ll reconditioning PCR reactions were performed per sample
to eliminate heteroduplexes [49], with 5-ll aliquots of the
initial PCR product mixture as the template and other PCR
conditions unchanged. Products of the two reconditioning
PCR reactions per sample were combined, purified using
QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen), and sent to the
J. Craig Venter Institute (Rockville, MD) for cloning and
automated bidirectional dideoxy sequencing.
Forward and reverse sequencing reads were assembled
using the Phred/Phrap/Consed suite of programs with default
parameters [50–52]; assembled sequences were aligned via the
NAST algorithm [53] at the Greengenes Website (http://
greengenes.lbl.gov/) [54]. Aligned sequences were checked for
chimeras using version 2 of the Greengenes implementation
of Bellerophon, with 99% similarity to a trusted sequence
over 1,250 nucleotides as the threshold to bypass checking,
and rejecting both putative and subthreshold chimeras
regardless of the divergence ratio. Of 10,062 assembled
sequences, 203 did not result in a NAST alignment that
included both the V3 and V6 regions, and 2,651 were
excluded as possible chimeras, leaving 7,208 full-length
sequences for analysis. Using the less-stringent default
settings in Bellerophon to identify chimeras (divergence ratio
. 1.1) would have excluded 766 fewer sequences from the

analysis, but the exclusion of these sequences did not
significantly affect the inferred taxonomic composition of
the community (Text S1). The taxonomic affiliation of full￾length sequences was determined using the Classifier tool of
the RDP, with an 80% bootstrap threshold [41].
The NAST-aligned full-length sequences were imported
into ARB [55] and a genetic distance matrix calculated with
the Olsen distance correction using the Hugenholtz version
of the Lane mask (included with Greengenes ARB database)
to exclude regions of questionable alignment; 1,241 columns
were retained. The distance matrix was used with a 0.01
genetic distance, furthest-neighbor threshold in DOTUR
version 1.53 [56] to designate 1,295 operational taxonomic
units (OTU0.01). The full-length sequences have been depos￾ited in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/; ac￾cession numbers: EU761594–EU768801).
16S rRNA Tag Pyrosequencing
Amplicon libraries for 16S rRNA V6 region pyrosequenc￾ing were generated as recommended by 454 Life Sciences,
using the same DNA extracts as for full-length sequencing,
with 50 ng of template DNA (determined by a NanoDrop
1000 spectrophotometer, NanoDrop Technologies) in 50-ll,
30-cycle reactions. The PCR reagents and thermocycling
parameters were those suggested in the protocol, except that
the annealing temperature was reduced from 57 8C to 55 8C.
Each PAGE-purified fusion primer (Integrated DNA Tech￾nologies) consisted of the 454 platform A or B linker/primer
sequence, a trinucleotide key (or barcode) that was unique for
each sample, and sequence complementary to a conserved
region flanking the V6 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene.
The forward primer was an equimolar mixture of two
nondegenerate oligonucleotides 5’-BxxxCAACGCGAA￾GAACCTTACC-39 and 5’-BxxxATACGCGAGGAACCT￾TACC-39, where B represents the B linker (59-
GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG-39), xxx represents the sample
identification key, and the remaining nucleotides correspond
to positions 967–985 of the 16S rRNA gene (Escherichia coli
numbering). The degenerate reverse primer was 5’-AxxxCGA￾CARCCATGCASCACCT-39, including the A linker (59-
GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAG-39), sample key, and nucleoti￾des corresponding to E. coli positions 1,064–1,046. Two or
three separate amplification reactions for each sample were
pooled and purified as recommended using Ampure beads
(Agencourt).
The amplicon length and concentration in the libraries was
estimated using the BioAnalyzer microfluidics device (Agi￾lent), and an equimolar mix of all 15 V6 amplicon libraries
was used to prepare both A-linked and B-linked pyrosequenc￾ing beads (i.e., for bidirectional reads of the amplicons) via
emulsion PCR using the recommended kit and protocol (454
Life Sciences). An equal mixture of A-linked and B-linked
beads was loaded onto both regions of a Picotiter plate
(estimated 825,000 beads/region). Pyrosequencing on the
Genome Sequencer FLX System (Roche) at the Stanford
Genome Technology Center resulted in 490,881 reads which
passed the length and quality criteria of the machine
software.
Preparation of amplicon libraries for the V3 region used
the same DNA extracts as for the full-length and V6
sequences, except that new DNA extracts were prepared for
samples 2c and 3b from individual A, and additional samples
2a, 2b, and 3a from individual A were included, as described
above and in Table 1. V3 amplicon libraries were prepared as
for the V6 region, using a single 50-ll PCR reaction per
sample and with the following PAGE-purified primers
(Integrated DNA Technologies): 5’-BxxxxxACTCCTACGG￾GAGGCAGCAG-39 (B linker, pentamer sample identification
key, forward primer at E. coli positions 338–357) and 5’-
AxxxxxTTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-39 (A linker, pentamer
key, reverse primer at E. coli positions 533–515). Preparation
of A-linked and B-linked beads and pyrosequencing were
carried out as described above, with an estimated 900,000
beads loaded in each region of the Picotiter plate, which
resulted in 593,088 pyrosequencing reads passing machine
quality filters.
Pyrosequencing reads of both the V6 and V3 regions were
passed through additional quality filters to reduce the overall
error rate [43]. Any reads containing one or more ambiguous
nucleotides and reads shorter than 50 nucleotides were
discarded. The expected sample keys and primer sequences
were trimmed from the proximal and distal ends of the reads,
and those lacking an expected sample key and primer
sequence at either end were examined further. In many of
these cases, a rare variant of the expected sequence was
identified and trimmed from the read. The origin of at least
some of these rare primer variants as oligonucleotide
synthesis errors was suggested by the frequent appearance
of several copies of a particular rare variant in a single
sample, while no examples of that variant appeared in any
other sample. Because unique primers (differing in the
sample key and synthesized separately) were used to generate
the amplicon libraries from each sample, a synthesis error
would be likely to affect only a single sample. Reads lacking a
recognizable primer sequence (including rare variants) at
either end, reads covering only a portion of the variable
region, and reads that could not be unambiguously assigned
to a sample were discarded; in addition, 18 reads from the V3
region with identity or near identity to eukaryotic rRNA
sequences were discarded. The resulting datasets contained
441,894 V6 tags and 490,699 V3 tags, which were the basis of
all subsequent analyses.
Reference Databases and OTU Definition for Tag
Pyrosequencing
The V6 and V3 reference databases (V6 RefDB, V3 RefDB)
are composed of publically available, high quality, full-length
16S rRNA sequences from Silva release 92 (http://www.
arb-silva.de/)[57] with taxonomic classifications obtained
from the RDP Classifier [41] (minimum 80% bootstrap score)
as described in [48]. The V6 region is defined as E. coli
positions 986-1045 corresponding to the sequence between
primers 967F and 1046R. The V3 region is defined as E. coli
positions 358–514, corresponding to the sequence between
primers 338F and 515R.
Pyrosequencing tags were assigned the taxonomic classi￾fication of the most similar reference sequence or sequences
in the V6RefDB or V3RefDB, based on a multiple sequence
alignment. In cases where a tag was equidistant to multiple
reference sequences, the tag was classified to the level of the
most resolved taxon shared by at least two-thirds of the
reference sequences nearest that tag. For example, a tag with
exact matches to multiple reference sequences would be
resolved to the genus level only if at least two-thirds of the
PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org November 2008 | Volume 6 | Issue 11 | e280 2386
Effects of an Antibiotic on Human Gut Microbiota

sequences containing that tag were classified in the same
genus with an 80% bootstrap score by the RDP.
A reference sequence-based operational taxonomic unit
(refOTU) was defined as containing all query tags sharing the
same RefDB sequence (or group of sequences) as their nearest
neighbor. The vast majority of human gut pyrosequencing
tags obtained in the current study (unlike marine tags [39])
have an exact or near match in the corresponding RefDB
(Figure 1), which simplifies the classification of tags and the
definition of refOTUs for this habitat. In this study, we will
refer to a specific refOTU as V3_Taxon refOTU_X, where
Taxon is the most-resolved taxon name assigned to the
refOTU, and X is the rank order of the refOTU within Taxon
based on the total normalized abundance data from this
study.
Statistical Calculations
The comparison of nearest database distance to tag
abundance, the rank abundance plots, the rarefaction curves,
and the diversity summary statistics were calculated using
actual tag counts without normalizing the number of tags
Figure 1. Genetic Distances between Tags and Reference Sequences
The genetic distances between each unique V6 tag (A) and V3 tag (B) and its best hit (or hits) in the appropriate reference database is shown on the
vertical axis (see Methods for details); the abundance of the tag is shown on a logarithmic scale on the horizontal axis. Horizontal arrows indicate
cumulative totals of tags from most to least abundant. Discrete horizontal rows of symbols near the x-axis correspond to an integer number of
nucleotide changes relative to a reference sequence; vertical arrows indicate cumulative tag totals for up to 0, 1, or 2 changes. Abundant tags are likely
to be identical to sequences in the reference databases; rare tags display a range of distances.

obtained per sample. Rarefaction curves for full-length
sequence OTU0.01s were calculated on a per-tag basis using
DOTUR version 1.53 [58]; rarefaction curves for variable
region refOTUs were calculated per sample using EstimateS
version 7.5 [59]. The Shannon diversity index H ¼ –R pi ln(pi)
and Shannon equitability index EH ¼ H/ln(S) (where pi is the
proportion of the ith OTU and S is the total number of
OTUs) were calculated using spreadsheet software. The
diversity summary statistics for Cp-associated samples were
compared to the lower tail of values for other samples,
assuming that summary statistics would be distributed
normally when calculated for samples drawn repeatedly from
an unchanging community.
Comparisons of V3 refOTU abundance between samples
were made after correcting for the unequal number of tags
obtained from each sample. All tag abundance values within a
sample were multiplied by the required factor so that total
normalized tag abundance for all samples was 43,405, which was
the number of V3 tags obtained from sample C5, the maximum
for any sample. Normalization factors for the other samples
ranged from 1.072 to 2.087. Principal component analysis of
normalized refOTU abundance used the prcomp function of the
stats package of the R statistical language, version 2.2.1 (http://
www.r-project.org/). Statistical assessment of variation in the
abundance of individual refOTUs between participants or with
respect to Cp was conducted with Edge software, version
1.1.291 [59], applying both a 95% confidence level for
individual taxa to declare significance, and a 10% false
discovery rate (FDR) criterion for all taxa declared significant
in a given comparison (additional details in Text S1).
Results
Number of Tags and Sequences
From 15 stool samples (five each from individuals A, B, and
C), we obtained 7,208 near full-length 16S rRNA sequences by
traditional PCR amplification, cloning, and capillary dideoxy
sequencing. From the same set of 15 samples, we obtained
441,894 V6 pyrosequencing tags (average length 59), and from
the same samples plus three additional samples from
individual A (18 samples total), we obtained 490,699 V3
pyrosequencing tags (average length 145) (Table 2). The
number of unique tags or sequences revealed by each method
followed the same rank order as the total number of tags or
sequences (V3 . V6 . full-length). However, the numerical
disparity between pyrosequencing and capillary sequencing
was smaller for unique tags or sequences than for all tags or
sequences, reflecting the competing trends of higher
throughput for tag pyrosequencing but greater resolution
for full-length sequences. The V6 and V3 tags were grouped
into 3,316 and 5,671 refOTUs, respectively, via comparison to
reference databases (see Methods); 1,295 OTUs were identi￾fied among full-length sequences using a 1% genetic distance
threshold after masking sequence positions of uncertain
alignment (designated as OTU0.01). The number of unique
genera or other most-resolved taxa above the genus level (see
Methods) identified among sequences or tags was much lower,
ranging from 56–130, confirming conclusions based on
earlier molecular studies that the diversity of human colonic
bacteria is concentrated at the species and strain level [2,29].
The abundant pyrosequencing tags derived from these
three participants were much more likely than were the rare
tags to have been seen before, i.e., to correspond perfectly to
one or more of the full-length 16S rRNA sequences already
available in the public databases. Even though only 9% of the
unique V6 tags and 7% of the unique V3 tags had exact
matches in the reference databases, these represented 90% of
all V6 tags and 85% of all V3 tags, because nearly all the
abundant tags had exact matches. Of the 100 most abundant
V6 and V3 tags (representing 75% and 80% of all tags,
respectively), 97 V6 tags and 94 V3 tags had perfect matches
in the reference databases. The abundant gut bacteria from
these participants were less well represented by cultivated
strains; only about half of the 100 most abundant tags (51 V6
tags and 55 V3 tags) had perfect matches to 16S rRNA
sequences derived from bacterial strains in culture (Dataset
S1).
Pyrosequencing Errors and Rare, Genuine Tags

than 99.75% for pyrosequencing of the V6 region [43] (after
applying additional filters to eliminate error-prone reads) is

Effects of an Antibiotic on Human Gut Microbiota

lower than that of capillary dideoxy sequencing, although
considerably better than the 96% accuracy initially reported
[38]. Undoubtedly, some fraction of the unique tags in our
data arose from pyrosequencing errors, but individual error
products were rare relative to the frequency of the correctly
sequenced tag from which they were derived. The most
abundant V6 and V3 tags in our data (exactly matching
Bacteroides dorei sequences) were observed 31,788 and 41,153
times, respectively, across all three participants. Assuming a
uniform error rate per base of 0.25% over 59 or 145
nucleotides, most tags are expected to be error-free, and
most error-containing tags are expected to have only a single
error. There were 177 unique V6 tags in our dataset that
differed from the B. dorei V6 tag at a single nucleotide
position and that lacked an exact match to any sequence in
the reference database. The most abundant of these potential
error products occurred only 60 times, 0.19% the frequency
of the error-free B. dorei V6 tag. Similarly, of 270 unique V3
tags differing from the B. dorei V3 tag at only one position and
lacking a perfect database match, the most abundant
occurred 367 times. However, we consider this to be a rare,
genuine tag, because the distribution of this tag among
samples differed significantly from that of the B. dorei tag, in
contrast to the pattern expected for a pyrosequencing error
product (following paragraph; also Text S1 and Dataset S2).
The most abundant potential V3 error product derived from
the B. dorei sequence occurred 226 times, 0.55% the frequency
of the error-free tag.
Sogin et al. suggested that using a reference database of
public full-length 16S rRNA sequences to define taxa (i.e.,
refOTUs) for pyrosequencing tags would result in a con￾servative estimate of taxonomic richness [39]. This procedure
will also minimize the influence of pyrosequencing errors on
comparisons of community composition, since such errors
could never result in the definition of a novel (but artificial)
taxon. Instead, most pyrosequencing error products will be
counted appropriately as a member of the refOTU contain￾ing the nearly identical error-free tag from which it was
derived. However, this OTU definition inherently limits the
detectable taxonomic diversity to the sequences already
present in the public databases, and it obscures genuine
biodiversity whenever tags derived from distinct organisms
are grouped into a single refOTU. We investigated this
diversity-masking effect for the most abundant V6 and V3
taxa by calculating, for each sample separately, the abun￾dance ratios of individual rare tags to the most common tag
belonging to the same refOTU (Text S1 and Dataset S2). For a
given rare tag, significant variation in this ratio across
samples is not expected if the rare tag is a pyrosequencing
error product, because the likelihood of a particular error is
independent of the origin of the tag. On this basis, four of the
42 rare V6 tags and 33 of the 87 rare V3 tags that we
investigated were not likely to be pyrosequencing error
products derived from the most common tag in the same
refOTU (G test, p , 0.05). Even though this approach cannot
differentiate all error-free, rare tags from pyrosequencing
error products, it is clear that analyzing pyrosequencing tags
on the basis of refOTUs will obscure some genuine
biodiversity. Nonetheless, we chose to accept this cost in
order to ensure that pyrosequencing errors did not inflate
the reported taxonomic richness, nor influence comparisons
between communities. Because the vast majority of abundant
tags had exact matches in the reference databases, the loss of
taxonomic resolution in the current study would have
affected mostly a subset of the rare taxa.
Exploring the Rare Biosphere in the Distal Human Gut
The rank abundance curves for OTUs derived from V6 and
V3 tags and full-length sequences (Figure 2) show the extent
to which tag pyrosequencing facilitated our exploration of
the rare biosphere of the human gut. There was substantial
agreement between the methods in the estimated relative
abundance of specific taxa ranging from the phylum to genus
level [48]. At a finer scale of resolution, the rank abundance
curves had similar shapes for the V6 and V3 refOTUs and
full-length OTU0.01s, with a small number of dominant taxa
and a long tail of less abundant taxa (Figure 2A). Tag
pyrosequencing identified many more OTUs than were
identified by a large, traditional 16S rRNA survey, but of
perhaps greater importance, there are many OTUs for which
pyrosequencing provided a more precise estimate of relative
abundance, and an improved confidence of detection. For
example, 869 of the 1,295 OTU0.01s detected among the
cloned full-length sequences were singletons, represented by
only a single sequence. The best estimate for the relative
abundance of each singleton OTU0.01 in the pooled com￾munity is 1/7,208 or 1.4 3 104
, but the 95% confidence
interval for this estimate (assuming a Poisson distribution of
detection events) ranges over almost 2 orders of magnitude,
7.3 3 106
–6.6 3 104
. There is only a 63% chance for a
specific taxon at 1.4 3 104 relative abundance to be detected
in a single sample of 7,208 clones, so the presence (or
absence) of these singleton OTUs does not provide a robust
basis for comparisons between samples. A refOTU that
appeared 65 times among the V6 or V3 tags would have
had the same estimated relative abundance as a singleton
OTU0.01 in the clone libraries, but with a much narrower 95%
confidence interval of 1.0 3 104
–1.7 3 104
. There were 1,122
refOTUs in the pooled V6 libraries which occurred often
enough (5 times) to estimate that their probability of
detection was at least 99%; the estimated relative abundance
for these taxa ranged from 7.4 3 102 to 1.1 3 105
. The
pooled V3 libraries had 1,759 refOTUs with at least 99%
probability of detection, with relative abundance ranging
over almost 4 orders of magnitude, from 9.3 3 102 to 1.0 3
105 Because the depth of pyrosequencing permits a high
confidence of detection for many moderately rare and rare
taxa, their presence or absence is informative for compar￾isons between samples. In contrast, in the pooled clone
libraries, there were only 199 OTU0.01s (relative abundance
ranging from 4.8 3 102 to 6.8 3 104
), with at least a 99%
estimated probability of detection.
Rank abundance curves for the V6 and V3 taxa within each
individual are shown in Figure 2B and 2C. A range of 1,673–
1,745 V6 refOTUs and 2,592–3,319 V3 refOTUs were found
per individual, providing minimal estimates of the number of
bacterial strains present in one person over an 8 month
interval. Considering all the sampling times together,
between 539–552 V6 refOTUs and 680–810 V3 refOTUs were
found in each individual at 99% confidence of detection or
above, compared to 66–98 full-length OTU0.01 per individual.
Rarefaction curves can be used to assess the degree of
completion of a taxonomic survey, i.e., how closely the
observed taxonomic richness approaches the endpoint of all

a tag or sequence library according to the Poisson distribution. A comparison of V6, V3, and full-length libraries is shown in (A); the abundance per
subject for V6 and V3 refOTUs are shown in (B and C). The maximum V3 refOTU abundance and number of V3 refOTUs are higher for individual A than
other participants (C) because three additional samples were analyzed for this subject.

Effects of an Antibiotic on Human Gut Microbiota

the taxa detectable with a particular method for that set of
samples [60]. Figure 3 shows that the OTU0.01 rarefaction
curve rises more steeply than the curves for V6 or V3
refOTUs, which reflects the greater taxonomic resolution of
this typical OTU definition applied to full-length sequences,
compared to the refOTU definitions for pyrosequencing tags.
On the other hand, although this set of 7,208 sequences is
among the largest datasets of full-length 16S rRNA sequences
from the human microbiota (or any environment), the
rarefaction curves for V6 and V3 tag pyrosequencing
eventually rise higher and display more curvature toward
the horizontal than the OTU0.01 curve. These features show
that a single run of the FLX sequencer targeting V6 or V3 tags
from the human gut microbiota can reveal more taxa, and
capture a larger proportion of the detectable taxa, than a
more extensive effort directed toward full-length 16S rRNA
clone sequencing.
However, the tag-based surveys are by no means complete,
as shown by the large number of singleton refOTUs in both
the V6 and V3 data (1,361/3,316 and 2,306/5,671, respectively).
Nonparametric estimators of total refOTU richness [61–63]
were 60–70% higher than the observed richness, in the range
of 5,300–5,700 refOTUs for the V6 tags and 8,875–9,650
refOTUs for the V3 tags. These large discrepancies between
observed and estimated richness, and the 20–35% increase in
estimated richness over the last half of sampling (Figure S1)
indicate undersampling, a situation in which nonparametric
estimators underestimate true richness [60,63]. The biological
significance of the many rare, unobserved taxa implied by
these estimates is unknown.
While rarefaction and richness estimators consider survey
completion from the perspective of identified and unidenti￾fied taxa, coverage considers completion from the perspec￾tive of individual tags or sequences. Good’s coverage [64], the
estimated likelihood that a tag or sequence chosen from the
sample at random will belong to an OTU that has already
been identified in the dataset, was 99.2% and 99.5% for V6
and V3 data, respectively, in contrast to 88% for the full￾length sequences. In other words, we expect that more than
100 additional tags would need to be sequenced in order to
detect a new refOTU for either variable region, while on
average less than ten new full-length sequences would suffice
to detect a new OTU0.01.
A Familiar Community with Fine-Scale Variation and
Uncharacterized Taxa
The heatmap in Figure 4A shows the relative abundance
across 18 samples of 1,450 V3 refOTUs with normalized total
abundance of at least ten. (Because normalization factors are
as high as two for some samples, this corresponds to at least
five observed tags, the threshold for 99% probability of
detection.) All the statistical comparisons between samples
that follow (e.g., PCA analysis and the identification of taxa
that vary in response to Cp treatment) use the normalized
abundance of these 1,450 taxa. Normalized V3 refOTU
abundance within the three most abundant genera, Bacter￾oides, Faecalibacter, and Roseburia, are shown in greater detail in
Figure 4B–4D, and the complete refOTU by sample abun￾dance matrix is provided as Dataset S3. The most striking
features of Figure 4 are consistent with our current under￾standing of the human distal gut microbiota [1,2,29,30]: (1)
Most members of the community belong to a small number of
genera within the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, with
members of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria occurring
much less frequently. (2) The diversity of genera and
subgeneric taxa is greater in the Firmicutes than Bacter￾oidetes. (3) The same genera tend to be abundant or rare
across all participants and all time points during unperturbed
states, but at a finer taxonomic scale, the gut microbiota is
individualized—some refOTUs are abundant in only one or
two individuals.
Additional observations can be made from Figure 4 and
Dataset S3 that are also consistent with previous data,
although perhaps not as widely appreciated: (4) Temporal
variability that is not associated with Cp treatment existed
within each individual, (especially individual A) although it
was not as evident as interindividual variation. (5) A total of
ten phyla were found in the gut microbiota of these
participants (six–nine per individual), some of which were
discovered only recently. The fifth most abundant phylum
was Verrucomicrobia (described in 1997) [65], within which
almost all tags were associated with the genus Akkermansia
(described in 2004) [66]. Akkermansia was of comparable
abundance to the entire family Enterobacteriaceae including
E. coli, the first described species of colonic bacteria. (6) In
2008, abundant, uncharacterized bacterial taxa are still found
in the human gut. The sixth most abundant refOTU was
V3_Clostridiales_refOTU_2, accounting for 3.5% of all V3
tags. The dominant tag in this refOTU exactly matched 203
cloned sequences in the V3 RefDB, but no sequences from
cultivated organisms. Of these 203 sequences, 29 are shorter
than 1,200 nucleotides or possibly chimeric; the remaining
174 sequences form a clade to the exclusion of any cultivated
Figure 3. Rarefaction Curves
The vertical axis shows the number of OTUs that would be expected to
be found after sampling the number of tags or sequences shown on the
horizontal axis. Curvature toward the horizontal indicates the increased
sequencing effort required to observe novel OTUs when only rare OTUs
remain to be discovered. Text boxes indicate the final observed OTU
richness (O), range of estimated OTU richness by the ACE, ICE, Chao 1
and Chao 2 nonparametric estimators (E) [61–63], and Good’s coverage
(C) [64] for each method. The nonparametric estimators indicate that
total OTU richness is much higher than currently observed, but are
known to underestimate the true richness when the number of
observations (i.e., tags or sequences) is small relative to the size of the
community [60,63]. Good’s coverage, the proportion of tags or
sequences found in OTUs containing at least one other member, is an
estimate of the probability that a tag or sequence drawn at random from
the pool of amplicons will belong to an OTU that has already been
detected.

organisms. Pairwise genetic distances within this clade
averaged 0.9%, while distances from sequences within the
clade to the most similar sequences from cultivated strains
averaged 10%, suggesting the presence of a novel species
divergent from cultivated bacteria at roughly the family level
(Dataset S4 and Figure S2).
Community-Wide Consequences of Host Individuality and
Cp Treatment
A dramatic effect of Cp on many taxa can also be seen in
Figure 4, although the effect is apparently stronger in
individuals A and B than individual C. Ecological diversity
statistics confirmed this impression, as shown in Figure 5. Cp
treatment significantly decreased taxonomic richness in the
Cp-associated samples in individuals A and B (p , 104 and p
, 0.005, respectively) but not C (p ¼ 0.24). Cp treatment
decreased the Shannon diversity index H (p , 105 in all
cases) and Shannon equitability index EH (p , 105 for A and
B, p , 0.05 for C) in all three individuals, although the
magnitude of the effect was smaller for C. The magnitude of
the Cp effect on diversity is best conveyed by transforming
the Shannon index to an effective number of species [67,68],
which is reduced 82%, 63%, and 36% in the Cp-associated
samples of A, B, and C, respectively (Figure S3). None of the
indices showed a detectable effect of Cp by 4 wk after
treatment.
Principal component analysis (PCA) of the log-transformed
relative abundance of V3 refOTUs (Figure 6) confirmed that
the primary sources of variability between samples were
inter-individual differences and Cp treatment. Differences
between individual B and the others were captured largely by
the first PCA axis, which accounted for 35.8% of all variability
between samples. The Cp-associated samples separated from
non-Cp samples of the same individual primarily along PCA
axis 2, which accounted for 18.6% of inter-sample variability.
The observation that Cp-associated samples of A and B are
closer to each other along axis 1 than the non-Cp samples
indicated that some of the abundant taxa that differed
between these individuals at other times became less
abundant following Cp treatment. The third PCA axis

Effects of an Antibiotic on Human Gut Microbiota

(9.7% of variability) appeared to be driven primarily by Cp￾independent temporal variability in individual A, with the
three samples collected in the one-week interval prior to Cp
treatment clustering at one extreme.
In the now-familiar context of interindividual variability in
the human microbiota [30,69–71], the similarity of the gut
communities in individuals A and C was unexpected. None of
the study participants are related, nor do they live or work
together, and individuals B and C would appear to be the
most similar to each other based on host traits such as gender,
ethnicity, and geographic origin (Table 1). Hence, other
factors (e.g., diet) that were not investigated in this study may
have an important influence on the similarity of the intestinal
communities from individuals A and C.
Log transformation of taxon relative abundance prior to
PCA reduces the influence of abundant taxa relative to that
of moderately abundant taxa; it has an impact intermediate
between performing no transformation, which allows abun￾dant taxa to dominate inter-sample variability, and scaling
the data so that the variability of each taxon among samples is
weighted equally. Not surprisingly, the first axes of PCA on
the untransformed refOTU data explained a higher propor￾tion of the total variability (because a few taxa accounted for
most of the variation); in this case, the distinction between
the Cp-associated and non-Cp samples of individual C was
obscured within the temporal variability of non-Cp samples
of individual A (Figure S4A). On the other hand, with scaled
PCA, the proportion of explained variability on the initial
axes was lower, but the Cp-associated samples of both A and
C were clearly separated in the same direction along axis 2
from a cluster containing all the non-Cp-associated samples
from both individuals (Figure S4B). As with the diversity
statistics, PCA (regardless of the abundance transformation)
did not reveal any Cp effect at 4 wk post-treatment that could
be distinguished from other sources of temporal variability. A
caveat to interpreting PCA with any weighting scheme is that
each refOTU is treated as equally dissimilar to all others.
Preliminary results from ordination techniques that consid￾ered a range of refOTU relatedness showed a smaller
magnitude of Cp-associated variability relative to the
magnitude of interindividual differences of community
composition (unpublished data).
Specific Taxa Involved in Community Variation
Over a third of the V3 refOTUs with normalized total
abundance of ten or more (528/1,450) differed significantly in
abundance between participants (p , 0.05, 2.9% FDR). The
taxa that varied between subjects included 64 of the 100 most
abundant refOTUs, i.e., those representing 0.2% or more of
all tags. An examination of these abundant taxa demonstra￾ted the importance of maintaining high phylogenetic
resolution during the analysis of tag pyrosequencing data
(Dataset S5). The 64 abundant refOTUs that varied between
subjects represent 23 different genera or other most-resolved
taxa above the genus level. However, when these genera and
more inclusive taxa were compared, only 11 of the 23 taxa
were found to differ between individuals (p , 0.05). For
example, 19 of the 100 most abundant V3 refOTUs belonged
to the genus Bacteroides, and 18 of them differed significantly
between individuals (Figure 7). However, the abundance of
the Bacteroides genus as a whole did not differ significantly
between individuals.
We tested taxa for a significant response to Cp by looking
for two patterns: either a difference between the relative
abundance in Cp-associated samples versus all other samples
(pattern 1), or a difference between the relative abundance in
pre-Cp samples versus samples collected during and after
treatment (pattern 2). A detectable Cp response in a
particular taxon could be a direct effect of Cp activity, or it
could be mediated by ecological interactions with other taxa.
Because these data represent relative abundance, a taxon that
maintains constant abundance in absolute terms as the total
community abundance declines will represent an increasing
proportion of the community. For comparisons across all
individuals we expressed the refOTU abundance in a sample
as the deviance of log abundance from the mean log
abundance of the refOTU in that individual; this procedure
compared changes in relative, not absolute abundance across
individuals. Cp effects were found in 30% of refOTUs (442/
1,450) when tested over all individuals, more according to
pattern 1 (428 taxa, p , 0.05, 7.7% FDR) and fewer according
to pattern 2 (46 taxa, p , 0.005, 10% FDR; 32 taxa are
significant according to both patterns) (Dataset S6). The
predominance of pattern 1 was expected based on the PCA
results shown in Figure 6; Cp-associated samples differed
from others within each subject, but no separation of pre￾and post-Cp samples was evident on the primary PCA axes.
A number of the abundant taxa found to vary significantly
in response to Cp appeared to have different responses
among the participants (Figure 8), which suggested that
testing for a Cp response within each individual might reveal
additional taxa that respond to Cp only in some subjects.
Testing only within A, for example, revealed that 25% (314/
1,260) of refOTUs varied in response to Cp (pattern 1: 314
taxa significant, p , 0.05, 6.9% FDR; pattern 2: 1 taxon
significant, p , 104
, 1.5% FDR, this taxon was significant by

pattern 1 as well) (Dataset S7). Slightly less than half of these
taxa (158/321) were found to be Cp responsive when testing
across all individuals; the taxa found to be significant both
within A and across all individuals were concentrated among
the more abundant taxa. With data from only a single Cp￾associated sample, we cannot yet conduct a similar compar￾ison within individuals B and C, but the Cp response of the
intestinal microbiota appears to be individualized, partic￾ularly for less abundant members of the community.
Discussion
We applied the 16S rRNA tag pyrosequencing strategy of
Sogin et al. [39] to characterize bacterial populations in the
distal human gut, which constitute the predominant com￾munity of the human microbiota and one of the most densely
populated microbial habitats on Earth. This approach
revealed both the pervasive effects of an antibiotic that is
considered to be relatively benign for the gut microbiota, and
the resilience of the human gut microbiota following
perturbation. As shown with marine, soil, and macaque gut
samples [39,42,45], massively parallel pyrosequencing permits
the exploration of microbial diversity in complex commun￾ities to an unprecedented depth. In comparison to clone
libraries and traditional dideoxy sequencing, tag pyrose￾quencing detects more taxa, and provides more-accurate
estimates of the relative abundance of a large number of
moderate- and low-abundance taxa. Such data will facilitate
better ecological studies of the human microbiota, with
immediate clinical application. For example, the composition
of the microbiota at the start of antibiotic treatment may
determine the likelihood of pathogen overgrowth and life￾threatening antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) [72,73];
investigation of this hypothesis will depend on comprehen￾sive characterizations of the community over time, including
both rare and abundant taxa. Of the four bacterial pathogens
associated with severe AAD, tags matching Klebsiella oxytoca
and Clostridium perfringens were detected rarely in the current

of intersample variation) separates Cp-associated samples from others. The separation of the Cp-associated samples from others is greatest for
individual A, intermediate for B, and least for C, consistent with the heatmaps (Figure 4) and diversity statistics (Figure 5).

Effects of an Antibiotic on Human Gut Microbiota

matching Clostridium difficile or Staphylococcus aureus were not
found. The rarity of these pathogens and the absence of
severe AAD in the current study is not surprising, since only a
small number of healthy young adults were involved. It would
be of tremendous interest and practical value to conduct a
similar study of stool samples collected over time from elderly
patients in hospitals or long-term care facilities, which have
higher frequencies of both antibiotics use and serious
complications from such use.
Cp is reported to have a lower rate of common gastro￾intestinal side effects than some other broad-spectrum
antibiotics, and effects on gut microbial diversity (as detected
by a low resolution ‘‘fingerprinting’’ technique) were less
pronounced for Cp than for clindamycin or amoxicillin￾clavulanic acid [25]. Nonetheless, the relative abundance
levels of about 30% of the taxa in the gut were affected by Cp
treatment when the comparison was made across all
individuals, and additional taxa were found to respond to
Cp within a single participant. Some of these changes may be
direct effects of varying sensitivity to the antibiotic among
the taxa comprising the gut microbiota. The refOTUs that
increased in relative abundance following Cp treatment may
represent taxa with intrinsic resistance to the antibiotic,
strains that are typically Cp-sensitive but that had already
acquired resistance prior to this study, or strains that
developed Cp-resistance due to the current exposure.
However, many of the changes in the community are likely
to be explained by indirect effects, mediated by ecological
interactions among taxa such as resource competition, cross￾feeding, or the cooperative lysis of polymeric substrates
[74,75].
Despite a pervasive disturbance of the gut microbiota, gut
function remained normal as assessed subjectively by the
participants, and the community composition in samples
taken 4 wk after treatment were within the range of temporal
variability of pretreatment samples. While the current study
did not include samples showing the temporal features of the
return of the community to its prior state, a pyrosequencing￾based investigation of this rapid transition in a complex
community is clearly of interest, and is continuing in our
laboratory. The apparent continuity of gut function supports
the hypothesis that the diversity of the microbial community
provides functional redundancy [2]. At the same time,
continuity in the predominant metabolic activity of the
community, i.e., hydrolysis and fermentation of polysacchar￾ides, does not necessarily imply the continuity of more
specialized activities [7,76] such as bile transformation [77],
immune modulation [9,78], or pathogen resistance due to
specific inhibition [79,80]. Yet, the rapid return of the gut
community to its pretreatment state in each individual
suggests that not all communities supporting similar func￾tions are equivalent. A quantitative examination of the
metabolic transformations and host interactions of the gut
microbiota during perturbation will be necessary to assess
functional stability. In addition, it will be important to
examine the microbiota at different sites within the intestinal
tract in order to appreciate possible local antibiotic effects
that are not revealed in fecal specimens. Epidemiological
studies associating antibiotic-induced changes in the gut
microbiota with chronic diseases [15,81] suggest that some
consequences of community change may not be evident
immediately.
An investigation into the factors responsible for commun￾ity resilience is warranted. A mixture of selective forces
intrinsic to the community (e.g., a competitive hierarchy
based on relative growth rates and substrate affinity or
interference mechanisms) and imposed by the environment
(e.g., composition of the diet and of host-derived substrates) is
likely to be involved, but nonselective forces such as re￾colonization of the gut lumen from protected environments
(perhaps the mucosa) must also be considered.
The current study can be compared to that of Young and
Schmidt, who investigated changing bacterial populations in
stool samples from a single patient with self-resolving AAD
subsequent to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment [82].
These investigators noted the complete absence of sequences
from Clostridium cluster XIVa on the fourth day of antibiotic
treatment (down from 20% on day 0) and a reduction from
33% to 15% of sequences affiliated with the genus Faecali￾bacterium; these two groups include the majority of butyrate￾producing bacteria in the human gut [83]. (Butyrate is the
preferred energy source of colonocytes.) In contrast, none of
the participants in the current study experienced AAD. While
Faecalibacterium refOTUs declined in all participants in
response to Cp, each individual had other refOTUs with
Figure 7. Abundant Taxa in the genus Bacteroides
The relative abundance per subject of Bacteroides V3 refOTUs, expressed
as the percentage of all V3 tags from that subject. The 19 most abundant
Bacteroides refOTUs range from the first to the 91st most abundant taxa
overall. Eighteen of these 19 Bacteroides refOTUs differ significantly in
abundance between subjects (p , 0.05, FDR ¼ 1.9%, NS marks the
exception), but the abundance of the Bacteroides genus as a whole does
not (p ¼ 0.075, FDR 15%). Numbers in the legend indicate the rank order
normalized abundance of refOTUs within Bacteroides, and correspond to
the designation of the OTU according to the convention of this report
(i.e., ‘‘1’’ represents V3_Bacteroides_refOTU_1.) The dominant tag in 15 of
the 19 most abundant Bacteroides refOTUs has a perfect match to
reference sequences from the cultivated species named in the legend.

Effects of an Antibiotic on Human Gut Microbiota

dominant tags exactly matching known butyrate-producing
organisms that maintained or increased their abundance
during Cp treatment (e.g., V3_Roseburia_refOTU_1 in
individual B matches Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Roseburia
intestinalis [84], V3_Anaerostipes_refOTU_1, in individuals A
and C, matches the unnamed butyrate-producing strains SS2/
1 and SSC/2 [85]).
Although the community as a whole showed a substantial
return to the pre-Cp composition within 4 wk of the end of
Cp treatment, there were examples of taxa that were affected
by Cp and did not recover. V3_Clostridiales_refOTU_23
was the 41st and 52nd most abundant taxon before Cp
treatment in individuals A and C, respectively, and present in
all pre-Cp samples (means of 206 and 158 tags per sample); it
was completely absent from all samples after the start of Cp
treatment. This refOTU includes perfect matches to clones
obtained from the human gut and from swine manure
lagoons, but none to a cultivated bacterium. The most similar
cultivated species are Clostridium piliforme and C. colinum, both
zoonotic pathogens. V3_Bilophila_refOTU_1 was the 82nd
and 79th most abundant pre-Cp refOTU in individuals A and
C (means of 60 and 91 tags/sample); it was reduced to an
average of less than two tags per sample after Cp treatment
began. V3_Bilophila_refOTU_1 responded differently in
individual B, in whom it was absent from the Cp-associated
sample but subsequently rebounded to pre-Cp levels. The
dominant tag of this refOTU exactly matches Bilophila
wadsworthia, a common gut microbe that is frequently isolated

Effects of an Antibiotic on Human Gut Microbiota

in cases of appendicitis and from intestinal and extraintes￾tinal abscesses [86]. The clinical significance of these
persistent Cp-induced changes is unknown, but some gut
bacteria are known to have important health effects despite
being present at moderate or low abundance. For example,
Oxalobacter formigenes is the most important known oxalate
degrader in the human gut, an activity associated with a
reduced risk for the development of calcium oxalate kidney
stones [22]. O. formigenes is found at low abundance in most
children, but is absent from many adults, which is generally
attributed to its susceptibility to many antibiotics [22]. Tags
matching O. formigenes were not detected in the current study.
Certain abundant taxa responded differently to Cp in
different individuals, as shown in Figure 8. This result is not
surprising when we consider that antibiotic resistance, even
high-level Cp resistance resulting from chromosomal muta￾tions [87], can be acquired far more rapidly than the rate of
evolutionary change in the 16S rRNA gene. Although the
participants had not taken any antibiotics in the year prior to
the study, their earlier exposure to Cp or other antibiotics is
unknown. Once established, antibiotic resistant strains can
persist in the human gut for years in the absence of further
antibiotic use [28]. Another potential explanation for
divergent Cp responses of the same refOTU between
individuals is the existence of indirect effects; the response
may be mediated by ecological linkages that differ between
individuals.
As shown in the companion paper of Huse et al. [48], the
inferred bacterial community composition in these samples
at taxonomic levels from phylum to genus was very similar,
whether based on tags from the V6 or V3 variable regions or
on full-length 16S rRNA sequences. All three techniques
involve PCR amplification, and hence could fail to detect
certain phylogenetic groups or lead to skewed levels of tag or
sequence relative abundance with respect to the starting
material [88,89]. However, the similarity of the results
obtained from three distinct sets of primers suggests that
the PCR bias of these primers (and the cloning bias for full￾length sequences) for the bacterial taxa present in this habitat
is minimal. The interpretation of these results as a measure of
the relative abundance of cells in the gut habitat must still be
made with caveats regarding differential cell lysis and the
unequal numbers of rRNA genes per genome, as for any 16S
rRNA-based technique [88,89].
Clearly, full-length sequences will provide the highest
possible phylogenetic resolution for any genetic locus.
However, pyrosequencing tags from either of two carefully
chosen, short variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene have
sufficient resolution to reveal taxonomic richness that
exceeds any previously observed for samples of host￾associated microbial communities, even though most diver￾sity in these habitats is concentrated at the species and strain
level [2,29]. This success occurred despite our use of
reference databases to define OTUs, which necessarily con￾strained the resolution of tag pyrosequencing to the diversity
already represented in public 16S rRNA sequence databases.
A more accurate assessment of microbial diversity that
accounts for the novel 16S rRNA variants discovered by
pyrosequencing will depend on defining OTUs with reference
to the tags themselves (e.g., using tag sequence divergence),
with appropriate treatment of potential pyrosequencing
errors. A high proportion of tags in the current study have
an exact match in the database, due to the substantial
sequencing effort that has already been directed to the
human gut microbiota [7,30,90]. Hence, the constraint of
defining OTUs with respect to a database is not as severe for
this habitat as it may be for others [39,42]. However, the
limitations of full-length 16S rRNA sequence surveys for
discovering rare members of the gut biosphere are demon￾strated by the contrast between the abundant tags in this
study, almost all of which have an exact match in the
database, and rare tags, which occur at a range of distances
from their nearest database match (Figure 1).
This study has confirmed the existence of more than 5,600
bacterial taxa in the human gut, exceeding earlier predictions
made on the basis of nonparametric richness estimators and
full-length 16S rRNA sequencing studies [29,30], but the
presence of singleton OTUs in our data leads to a still larger
predicted richness for this habitat. As has long been
appreciated, the highly uneven abundance distribution
among taxa in this community (Figure 1, Dataset S3) hampers
the identification of rare taxa via traditional sequencing
approaches. However, coverage values exceeding 99% for our
V6 and V3 data correspond to estimates that fewer than 1%
of all detectable 16S rRNA tags in these samples belong to
taxa that have not yet been detected. Individually, any of the
rare, unobserved taxa in these samples are unlikely to exceed
0.001% of all 16S rRNA genes, the relative abundance at
which we have roughly 99% confidence of detection. Because
so many distinct reference tags are matched exactly by the
tags obtained in this study, we conclude that a large number
of bacterial taxa previously identified as gut inhabitants in a
range of previous 16S rRNA sequencing studies can be
present simultaneously or sequentially in a single individual,
albeit at widely varying abundance. As suggested in a recent
revision to the maxim of Baas Becking, ‘‘Everything may be
everywhere, but not in equal amounts’’ [91]. This result
challenges microbial ecologists to account for persistent
differences in the composition of the microbiota between
individuals, either by ongoing selective forces that vary
among individuals such as diet and host genotype, or by
factors such as founder effects and specific mutualistic
interactions that stabilize community composition. However,
any explanation will also have to account for the temporal
variability shown by some taxa, and the resilience of the
community to perturbations involving a significant fraction
of its constituent populations.

Figure S3. Cp Effects Assessed via Effective Number of Taxa
Cp decreases the effective number of refOTUs [67] in the gut
bacterial community as assessed by diversity of order zero (0
D) (A),
order one (1
D) (B), and order two (2
D) (C). Diversities of different
orders vary in the relative importance of rare and abundant taxa in
calculating a diversity index. The use of an effective number of taxa
as the unit of diversity overcomes difficulties with traditional
measures such as the Shannon-Weiner index (Figure 5B) and the
Gini-Simpson index, which are measured in units that are not
commensurate with each other, and that have no natural interpre￾tation. An effective number of taxa is interpreted as the number of
equally abundant taxa that would result in the same calculated
diversity as the community under investigation. 0
D disregards
abundance to consider rare and abundant taxa equally important,
thus it is equivalent to taxon richness as shown in Figure 5A. 1
D
considers that taxa contribute to diversity in proportion to their
relative abundance (like the Shannon-Weiner index, compare Figures
5B and S3B), and 2
D weighs taxa in proportion to the square of
relative abundance (like the Gini-Simpson index). Cp-associated
samples are significantly lower in 1
D and 2
D than other samples for all
individuals.

Figure S4. Untransformed and Scaled PCA
The transformation applied to taxon abundance data influences the
similarity of samples as assessed by PCA. PCA on untransformed V3
refOTU abundance data emphasizes the small number of highly
abundant taxa (A). In this case, the first PCA axis captures both
community differences between individual B and the others, and
differences between the communities of Cp-affected samples and
other samples of individual A. The second PCA axis reflects
differences in the Cp-associated samples of both individuals A and
B. Changes of community composition in the Cp-associated sample
of individual C were less distinct than in the other individuals
(Figures 4–6), and with untransformed abundance data the Cp￾associated sample of individual C falls within the cluster of non-Cp
samples of individuals A and C. The influence of abundance can be
removed entirely by scaling the data so that the inter-sample
variance of each taxon is weighted equally (B). In this case the Cp￾associated samples of both individuals A and C are displaced in the
same direction along PCA axis 2 from the cluster of non-Cp samples
of these individuals. However, the Cp-associated sample is less
distant from the non-Cp samples within individual B. Considered
together, these results suggest that the effects of Cp in individual C
involve changes in the identity of less abundant taxa, while in
individual B the effects also involve large changes in the abundance
of taxa. Cp-associated changes in individual A involve many of the
same taxa as in individual C, but changes in the abundant taxa are
more pronounced.
