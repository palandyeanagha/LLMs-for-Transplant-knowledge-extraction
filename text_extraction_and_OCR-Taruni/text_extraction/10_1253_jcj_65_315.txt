rimary cardiac tumors are rare, with an incidence of
approximately 0.02% in unselected patients at
autopsy. Three-quarters of the tumors are benign.
Nearly half of the benign heart tumors are myxomas, and
most of the rest are lipomas, papillary fibroelastomas, and
rhabdomyomas.1 In adults, approximately 25% of primary
cardiac tumors are malignant, and one-third of these tumors
are angiosarcomas.1 Although cardiac myxomas have been
well investigated regarding both clinical features and treat￾ment,2 non-myxoma primary cardiac tumors are less under￾stood. Especially in malignant primary cardiac tumors,
there are many uncertainties because of their aggressive
biological characteristics and the limited experience of any
one center in their management. This report reviews the
clinical experience and late results of surgical treatment of
both benign and malignant cardiac tumors at Kanazawa
University Hospital over the past 28 years as well as the
English literature. We discuss the management of patients
with this rare disease.
Patients and Methods
From 1973 to 2000, 34 patients underwent surgical
resection of primary cardiac tumors at Kanazawa University
Hospital. The medical reports and diagnostic data were
reviewed. The total follow up for the series was 248
patient-years, averaging 7.5 years (range, 5 months to 28
Japanese Circulation Journal Vol.65, April 2001
years). The patients were divided into 3 categories: (i)
myxomas; (ii) benign non-myxoma tumors; and (iii) malig￾nant tumors.
Myxomas
Myxomas represented 69% of the cardiac tumors oper￾ated at the hospital (23 patients; ie, 12 males and 11
females). The average age was 54.5 years (range, 16–75
years). Twenty-three resected myxomas included 22 left
atrial myxomas and 1 right atrial myxoma.
The preoperative symptoms were embolism (45%),
palpitations (37%), systemic illness (36%), angina (32%),
and congestive heart failure (27%). Three patients had no
symptoms (Table 1). Hemodynamic consequences includ￾ing palpitations, angina, and congestive heart failure were
found in 14 patients (64%). Seven of these patients were in
the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV.
Embolic episodes in the central nervous system occurred in
7 patients, although 2 of those represented transient

To examine the clinical features of primary cardiac tumors, 34 patients who underwent surgical treatment from
1973 to 2000 at the Kanazawa University Hospital were analyzed and the literature was reviewed. The 34
patients were divided into 3 categories: (i) myxomas; (ii) benign non-myxomas; and (iii) malignant tumors.
Twenty-three patients (70%) were diagnosed with myxomas, including 22 left atrial myxomas and 1 right atrial
myxoma. Seven patients (18%) were diagnosed with benign non-myxoma tumors, including 3 hemangiomas, 1
fibroma, 1 rhabdomyoma, 1 pheochromocytoma, and 1 lipoma. Four patients (12%) were diagnosed with malig￾nant tumors, including 2 angiosarcomas, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, and 1 malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Among
the myxoma patients, in-hospital mortality was 9% (2/23), late mortality was 10% (2/21), and no recurrent
myxomas have been identified. Among benign non-myxoma patients there were no perioperative deaths;
however, 1 patient died 11 years after surgery, with no linked cause. No recurrent tumors have been identified.
Among malignant tumor patients, 1 patient died the day following surgery and the rest died within 14 months.
Early and late results of surgery were acceptable for those patients with benign tumors, while the prognosis for
patients with malignant tumors was very poor. (Jpn Circ J 2001; 65: 315–319)

ischemic attacks and had no persistent symptoms. Episodes
in the peripheral artery occurred in 3 patients. Two of these
suffered from embolisms in the lower extremities and the
other suffered from an embolism in the left arm. Symptoms
of systemic illness included fever, general malaise, arthral￾gia, and weight loss.
The presence of a tumor was strongly suggested or
established by echocardiography in 22 patients. Only one
of these patients, with a left atrial myxoma, was not given
an echocardiogram in 1973 before it was widely used.
All patients underwent surgical removal of cardiac
myxomas using moderately hypothermic cardiopulmonary
bypass with cardiac arrest via median sternotomy. The surgi￾cal approach included biatriotomy in 10 patients (43%),
right atriotomy in 11 patients (48%), and left atriotomy in 2
patients (9%; Table2). Among 22 left atrial myxomas, 18
(81%) arose from the interatrial septum and 4 (19%) from
the posterior left atrial wall. The one right atrial myxoma,
which was the only one we found, arose from the posterior
right atrial wall. The tumor size varied from approximately
2×1×1cm to 7×5×4cm, averaging 5.4cm in the long axis.
The surface of the tumors was of the lobulated type in 17
patients (73%) and was of the smooth spherical type in 6
patients (27%). The pedicle of the tumor, along with an
adjacent cuff of the endocardium, was included in the
tissue removed. The resected site was reconstructed by
direct closure in 9 patients and Dacron patch closure in 14
patients. In the past 19 years, resected sites were recon￾structed using Dacron patches in all patients. Concomitant
mitral valve replacement was done in 1 patient with a left
atrial myxoma and mitral regurgitation. Five patients under￾went emergency operations because of severe congestive
heart failure due to mitral valve obstruction.
The association between patient symptoms and myxoma
characteristics, including the surface, the size in the long
axis, and the weight, were analyzed. For analysis in the
present study, cardiac myxoma symptoms were divided into
the following 3 groups:3 (i) hemodynamic consequences;
(ii) embolisms; and (iii) constitutional manifestations.
Benign Non-Myxoma Tumors
Benign non-myxoma tumors represented 18% of the
cardiac tumors resected at the hospital (7 patients; ie, 5
male and 2 female; Table 3). The average age was 33.5
years (range, 1–55 years). Two of these patients (cases 3
and 7; 1 left ventricle rhabdomyoma and 1 lipoma) had no
symptoms, and were checked for heart murmurs or abnor￾malities on electrocardiograms during a health screening.
Case 1 suffered from severe congestive heart failure due to
complex heart anomalies including a single ventricle,
complete transposition of the great arteries, a complete
endocardial cushion defect, and a right atrial hemangioma.
Case 2 suffered from sustained ventricular tachycardia. A
left ventricular fibroma was found during surgery for this
arrhythmia and pericardial mapping revealed that this
tumor was the cause of the ventricular tachycardia.4 In case
4, a right atrial pheochromocytoma was discovered during
a screening echocardiogram for prolonged hypertension.5
Case 5 was a left atrial hemangioma in a patient who
suffered from palpitations. A right atrial hemangioma was
found using echocardiography while investigating the
source of cerebral infarction in case 6.
The techniques for cardiopulmonary bypass and myocar￾dial protection were the same as those used for patients with
myxomas. All benign non-myxoma tumors were removed
successfully. In case 1, a Glenn operation and attendant
resection of the tumor were done.
Malignant Tumors
Malignant tumors represented 12% of the cardiac tumors
resected at the hospital (4 patients; ie, 3 males and 1
female; Table4). The average age was 55.5 years (range,
43–64 years). All patients suffered from hemodynamic
consequences and constitutional manifestations more
severely than in those patients with benign tumors. The
diagnosis of tumors was made directly by echocardiography
in all cases, and computed tomography was also done for
all cases. Case 1 suffered from severe congestive heart
failure with cardiac tamponade and preoperative drainage
was done. Malignant cells were found in the drained effu￾sion. The patient’s tumor was an angiosarcoma, which was
located at the posterior wall of the right atrium. Case 2 also
suffered from congestive heart failure with cardiac tampon￾ade. This patient needed concomitant right upper and middle
lobectomy due to direct invasion of a rhabdomyosarcoma
located at the left atrium. An emergency operation was
done for case 3, who had a malignant fibrous histiocytoma
located at the left atrium resulting in progressive heart
failure. Case 4 had an angiosarcoma located at the right
atrium, which caused chest oppression. All operations were
performed with the aid of a cardiopulmonary bypass, using
the same method as that for cardiac myxomas, and all these
tumors were resected completely.
The diagnosis for all tumors was confirmed histologically
in all cases. Variables in the study were analyzed using the
chi-squared test to detect any significant (p<0.05) differ￾ences between them.
Results
Myxomas
Early mortality occurred in 2 patients (9%). One died of
a stroke, which was probably caused by fragmentation of
the tumor resulting from surgical manipulation. The other
underwent an emergency operation for severe congestive
heart failure due to mitral obstruction. Although extirpation
of the tumor was successful, the patient died after 5 days
because of low output syndrome. Early morbidity included
atrial arrhythmias in 2 patients and moderately pericardial
effusion in another.
Late follow up was completed for the 21 patients from
the hospital. Late mortality was 10% (2/21) with no linked
cause. Late morbidity included cases of atrioventriclar

blocks and chronic renal failure. No recurrent myxomas
were identified clinically or by echocardiography.
An analysis of the association between patient symptoms
and myxoma characteristics revealed a significant associa￾tion with embolisms and lobulated-type tumors. Embolisms
frequently occurred in patients with lobulated-type cardiac
myxomas (p<0.05). Other symptoms had no relationship
with myxoma characteristics.
Non-Myxomas
All patients with benign non-myxomas were discharged
from hospital without complications. Case 1 died suddenly
during exercise 12 years after surgery. Sustained ventricu￾lar tachycardia was stopped in case 2 by resection of a left
ventricular fibroma.4 The other 5 patients survived without
symptoms or recurrence of tumors (Table3).
Malignant Tumors
Case 1 died the day following surgery because of severe
pump failure. Intravenous chemotherapy was given to the
surviving patients. The 30-day regimen for this chemother￾apy was as follows: vincristine sulfate 1.5 mg, 3 times a
week; actinomycin D 0.35 mg/day for first 5 days; and
cyclophosphamide 60 mg daily. Despite chemotherapy, 3
survivors died after 6, 7, and 14 months because of local
recurrence of the tumor. A redo operation was not done for
any of these cases (Table4).
Discussion
In recent years, especially with the widespread use of
echocardiography, primary cardiac tumors have been
detected by chance and because patients report symptoms
promptly; hence, the number of patients undergoing the
surgical removal of tumors has increased. To clarify the
current clinical characteristics of primary cardiac tumors,
other series on surgery for primary cardiac tumors were
researched in the English literature.3,6–16 For this purpose,

we researched studies on cardiac myxomas only; other
specific tumors, pericardial tumors or metastatic cardiac
tumors were excluded.
Results showed that approximately 90% of primary
cardiac tumors were benign and 10% malignant (Table 5).
Approximately 85% of benign tumors were myxomas and
90% of malignant tumors were sarcomas, predominantly
angiosarcomas and fibrosarcomas. When considering only
infants, rhabdomyoma was the most dominant cardiac tumor
(Tables6,7), which is similar to our observed experience.
This latter result deviates from generally reported figures
that are based on autopsy series data collected more than
25 years ago.1 This is because there used to be a certain
number of inoperable malignant cardiac tumor cases, which
have decreased recently, and these were probably excluded
from this study.
There are 3 main patterns of clinical presentation for
patients with cardiac myxomas; that is, hemodynamic
consequences, embolisms, and constitutional manifesta￾tions, depending on tumor characteristics. In the present
study, the surface, size, and weight of myxomas were
analyzed and the surface was the only factor associated
with patients’ symptoms. This may be due to a number of
reasons. First, in hemodynamic consequences, myxoma
size is not the only important factor. The mobility of the
tumor is also important, and this depends on its flexibility,
the extent of attachment, and the length of the stalk.
Second, in the present study, embolisms occurred more
frequently in patients with lobulated-type myxomas. This
may be because these are fragile and because thrombi can
attach more easily to their surface than to the surface of the
smooth spherical type. Finally, in the present study, consti￾tutional manifestations were not associated with myxoma
characteristics. Although recent investigations have revealed
that it is caused by interleukin-6 in plasma depending on
the size of myxomas,17,18 unknown factors may affect this
phenomenon.
There are no regular symptoms in patients with non￾myxoma tumors. Tumors that arise from a ventricle can
cause ventricular tachycardia. Engle and coworkers reported
2 cases with ventricular tachycardia caused by left ventric￾ular tumors, which included myofibroma and rhabdomyofi￾broma.19 In the present series, a case of ventricular tachy￾cardia was caused by a left ventricular fibroma, which was
confirmed by intraoperative epicardial mapping.
In cases of malignant cardiac tumors, patients often suffer
from congestive heart failure due to cardiac tamponade,
and cytology of this effusion is useful for preoperative
diagnosis regardless of whether it is malignant or not.
The first successful resection of a cardiac tumor was a
case with a left atrial myxoma reported by Crafoord in
1954.20 Nowadays the operation carries a very small risk.
Cardiac myxomas arise mainly from the left atrial septum2
and 3 surgical approaches can be applied. These are: (i) a
biatriotomy; (ii) a right atriotomy; or (iii) a left atriotomy.
Although the first 2 approaches have been performed in
many hospitals, the most appropriate approach is still
controversial. Some investigators prefer a right atriotomy
and have observed patients without any recurrence.3,21 Others
have stressed the need to examine all 4 cardiac chambers
via the biatrial approach to prevent recurrence.13,22 In the
present series, a right atriotomy was initially performed. If
the tumor was too big or its stalk was too sessile for
complete resection, an additional left atriotomy was done.
Left atriotomy was performed in cases with left atrial
myxoma arising from the left atrial posterior wall. Any
attachment to the tumor was resected widely. Satisfactory
results without recurrence were obtained by this surgical
method at Kanazawa University Hospital. Non-myxoma
cardiac tumors arise at various locations and it is difficult to
establish a regular surgical strategy.3,6–16 Various cardiotomy
procedures are possible and complete excision of all visual
tumors with a cuff of normal tissue is required. However,
in cases of malignant cardiac tumors, this is often difficult
because of invasion or tumor extension.
Generally, recurrences of myxomas, including second
recurrences, have been observed.2 McCarthy and colleagues
identified 3 clinical types of myxoma and estimated the risk
of recurrence in each group.23 The common type is called
‘sporadic’ myxoma. The mean age of patients with sporadic
myxomas is more than 50 years, the tumor is almost always
single, and the estimated risk of recurrence is less than 1%.
‘Complex’ cardiac myxoma is characterized by associated
skin lesions (ephelides, nevi, or lentigines), skin myxomas,
myxoid mammary fibroadenomas, Cushing’s syndrome,
pituitary adenoma, or unusual testicular tumors. The risk of
recurrence is approximately 20%. ‘Familial’ cardiac myx￾oma has similar features to the complex type with familial
history. The patients are young and the risk of recurrence is

approximately 10%. In the present study, a patient aged
16 years with a left atrial myxoma had a familial history.
His father had undergone extirpation of the left atrial
myxoma and mitral valve replacement for mitral regurgita￾tion at 30 years of age. At first, the teenager, who was 190
cm tall, was diagnosed with acromegaly gigantism with
pituitary adenoma. Cutaneous hyperpigmentation occurred
on his face and trunk as well as on his lips. Recent studies
have advocated a new concept, ‘Carney Complex’, which
includes complex and familial cardiac myxomas as an
autosomal dominant syndrome.24 The teenager and his
father fulfilled the criteria for Carney Complex, having left
atrial myxomas and cutaneous lesions. Although Carney
Complex has a high risk of recurrence, neither father nor son
has had any recurrence of myxoma over observation periods
of 15 years and 2 years, respectively. The prognosis for
benign non-myxomas is generally favorable with a low
recurrence,3,6–16 and no recurrent tumors were observed in
the present series. Moreover, the prognosis of patients was
quite good even if they underwent incomplete resection.13
In contrast, the prognosis of patients with primary malignant
cardiac tumors is very poor.3,6–16 In the present series, all
patients with malignant tumors died within 14 months.
Similar results were observed in other series and, of 135
patients with malignant cardiac tumors, only 3 patients
were still alive 3 years after surgery.3,8,12 In comparison
with malignant tumors from other organs, the prognosis of
malignant cardiac tumors is very poor.25 Therapy for malig￾nant cardiac tumors usually consists of surgical resection,
advanced chemotherapy and irradiation. However, these
treatments were not effective in most cases. Early cardiac
transplantation is a promising therapy for malignant cardiac
tumors. Goldstein and coworkers reported that for 6 patients
in whom cardiectomy resulted in surgical margins free of
the tumor, orthotopic heart transplantation enabled long￾term survival without tumor recurrence, despite therapeutic
immunosuppression.26 Nevertheless, heart transplantation
for malignant cardiac tumors is not performed in Japan
because the therapy is controversial due to ethical and
social problems.
In conclusion, early and late results of surgery were more
specifically predicted in the present series by histological
tumor type. Surgical resection of benign cardiac tumors
offers excellent long-term survival for most patients, espe￾cially in cases undergoing complete resection. Conversely,
in cases with malignant tumors, the prognosis is still very
poor. Heart transplantation is a hopeful therapy for these
patients.
