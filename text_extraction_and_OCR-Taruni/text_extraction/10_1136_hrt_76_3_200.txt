Research Article
The need for artificial hearts.

Oxford Heart Centre, Oxford Radcliffe Hospital.
Abstract
Chronic immunosuppression, allograft coronary disease, and
restricted availability of donor organs continue to limit the scope of
cardiac transplantation. Meanwhile increasingly favourable
experience with implantable blood pumps used as a bridge to
transplant has reintroduced the concept of permanent mechanical
cardiac support. Existing models (for example, the Thermo
Cardiosystems Heartmate device) are now used for such support in


patients who are not candidates for transplantation. Miniaturised
axial flow pumps such as the Jarvik 2000 fit within the failed left
ventricle and provide an exciting prospect for the treatment of heart
failure in the future. Preliminary experience suggests that the
"offloaded" left ventricle may recover. Mechanical blood pumps can
be used before the onset of multisystem failure and removed if the
myocardium recovers. This "bridge to recovery" concept should be
tested in patients with recoverable cardiomyopathy and those with
coronary disease and poor left ventricular function where an
implantable pump can be used in conjunction with myocardial
revascularisation.
