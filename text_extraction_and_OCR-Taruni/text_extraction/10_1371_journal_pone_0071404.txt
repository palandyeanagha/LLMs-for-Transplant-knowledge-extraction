Abstract
Background: Uremic pruritus is a common and intractable symptom in patients on chronic hemodialysis, but factors
associated with the severity of pruritus remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the associations of metabolic factors
and dialysis adequacy with the aggravation of pruritus.
Methods: We conducted a 5-year prospective cohort study on patients with maintenance hemodialysis. A visual analogue
scale (VAS) was used to assess the intensity of pruritus. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory
parameters, dialysis adequacy (assessed by Kt/V), and pruritus intensity were recorded at baseline and follow-up. Change
score analysis of the difference score of VAS between baseline and follow-up was performed using multiple linear regression
models. The optimal threshold of Kt/V, which is associated with the aggravation of uremic pruritus, was determined by
generalized additive models and receiver operating characteristic analysis.
Results: A total of 111 patients completed the study. Linear regression analysis showed that lower Kt/V and use of low-flux
dialyzer were significantly associated with the aggravation of pruritus after adjusting for the baseline pruritus intensity and a
variety of confounding factors. The optimal threshold value of Kt/V for pruritus was 1.5 suggested by both generalized
additive models and receiver operating characteristic analysis.
Conclusions: Hemodialysis with the target of Kt/V $1.5 and use of high-flux dialyzer may reduce the intensity of pruritus in
patients on chronic hemodialysis. Further clinical trials are required to determine the optimal dialysis dose and regimen for
uremic pruritus.

Introduction
Uremic pruritus is a common and intractable symptom in
patients on chronic hemodialysis [1,2]. It causes serious discomfort
and skin damage, negatively affects the quality of life, and may be
associated with sleep disturbance, inflammation, and higher
mortality [3,4]. The pathophysiology of uremic pruritus is
complex. Previous studies have shown that xerosis, divalent ions,
calcium-phosphate product, C-reactive protein, hepatitis, hyper￾parathyroidism, immune derangement, and opioid system alter￾nation may be associated with uremic pruritus [5–13]. However,
there has not been a consensus reached among those studies, and
uremic pruritus remains poorly characterized. Because of insuffi￾cient understanding for uremic pruritus, current therapeutic
options for uremic pruritus are limited and unsatisfactory [14,15].
Many patients have a prolonged course of uremic pruritus. In
particular, 30–60% of patients on maintenance hemodialysis suffer
from this problem for longer than one year [1,16]. And while
Mathur described the key features of uremic pruritus and its effect
on health-related quality of life in a longitudinal follow-up study
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71404

[1], the relationships between the intensity of uremic pruritus and
biochemical parameters were not investigated. In fact, the intensity
of uremic pruritus may vary significantly throughout the course of
chronic kidney disease, but factors associated with the severity of
pruritus remain unclear due to the lack of relevant longitudinal
follow-up studies.
To address this issue, we conducted a prospective 5-year cohort
study on hemodialysis patients to identify predictors for the
aggravation of pruritus intensity. The relationship of pruritus
intensity with metabolic profiles as well as dialysis adequacy was
assessed by using change score analysis to consider the individual
change in covariates during a longitudinal follow-up.
Materials and Methods
Study Participants
A prospective cohort study of patients with maintenance
hemodialysis in the hemodialysis center of the Far Eastern
Memorial Hospital had been conducted from February 2007 to
July 2011. At the start of this period, a total of 374 patients were
receiving maintenance hemodialysis, but excluded from this study
were patients with (i) active infection, (ii) recent hospitalization
within three months, (iii) psychotic illness or other communication
problems, (iv) primary skin disorders, (v) cholestatic liver disease or
acute hepatitis, or (vi) active malignancy. Finally, 321 patients (age:
60612 years; 162 females and 159 males) were thus recruited in
February 2007 [9,13]. By the end of follow-up, there were 210
dropouts, including 96 withdrawals, 66 deaths, 3 renal transplan￾tations, and 45 patients transferred to other hemodialysis centers.
A total of 111 patients remained until the follow-up in July 2011
and completed the study. The study participants received 3.5–5.0
hours of hemodialysis three times a week using bicarbonate
dialysate and reverse osmosis purified water, with the target dose
of Kt/V (amount of dialysis delivered: K = clearance of urea,
t = time on dialysis, V = estimated total body water) $1.4 to ensure
the adequacy of solute clearance [17]. In 73% of participants, a
high-flux polysulfone membrane was used as the dialyzer, while
the remaining 27% used a low-flux synthetic membrane dialyzer.
Ethics
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Far Eastern Memorial Hospital in advance and a written informed
consent was obtained from each participant.

Uremic Pruritus in Hemodialysis Patients
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71404

Pruritus Assessment
The severity of pruritus measured by the visual analogue scale
(VAS) from 0 to 10 (0 = no pruritus, 10 = intolerable pruritus) was
reported from each participant at baseline and follow-up. The
evaluation of the baseline VAS score for each participant was
completed in February 2007. In July 2011, the participants were
re-evaluated using the VAS score to assess the severity of pruritus.
Patient Characteristics and Laboratory Parameters
Patient demographic and clinical characteristics, including
gender, age, presence of hypertension or diabetes, underlying
renal disease, concurrent medications, as well as the regimens and
vintage of hemodialysis, were recorded. Venous blood was
sampled in the morning, after an overnight fast exceeding 8 hours
before the patient’s mid-week dialysis. All laboratory tests were
performed by the hospital’s central laboratory. Biochemistry data
were determined using a Hitachi 747 auto-analyzer. The Kt/V
and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) were calculated
using a single-compartment model [17,18].The high sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were assayed by an image
autoanalyzer using the nephelometric method (Beckman Coulter,
Inc., CA, U.S.A.). The clinical and laboratory parameters were
recorded for each participant at baseline in February 2007 and at
follow-up in July 2011.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the R 2.14.1 software (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A two￾sided P value #0.05 was considered statistically significant. The
distributional properties of continuous data were expressed as
mean 6 standard deviation or median with interquartile range, as
appropriate. The categorical data were presented by frequency
and percentage. As a descriptive analysis, univariate analyses were
performed using a Student’s t test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
Mann-Whitney U test, McNemar’s test, or Pearson Chi-square
test, as appropriate.
Each participant’s clinical characteristics, laboratory parame￾ters, and VAS score of pruritus intensity were recorded at baseline
and follow-up. The intra-individual differences (called the change
score) of these variables between baseline and follow-up were
calculated, i.e., the change score of X= X at follow-up 2 X at
baseline [19]. Causal analysis of individual change using the
change score was performed [19], which allows causal interpre￾tation of relationships between individual characteristics and
patterns of uremic pruritus intensity [20]. In the multivariate
analysis, a change-score analysis was conducted using the linear
regression model to identify the predictors associated with the
change score of VAS [20]. Given the available covariates
including age, gender, comorbid diseases, and blood laboratory
parameters, the regression analysis of change score of VAS
proceeded in two steps: (1) only the baseline covariates, not the
change scores of covariates, were considered in regression analysis;
(2) next, both the baseline and change scores of covariates were
considered in regression analysis.
Generalized additive models (GAMs) are able to detect
nonlinear effects of continuous covariates during the stepwise
variable selection procedure of regression analysis [21]. We used
GAMs to discover the functional form of the potential dose￾response relationship between baseline Kt/V and change score
of VAS after adjusting for the effects of confounding factors.
Computationally, we used the vgam function (with its default
values of smoothing parameters) of the VGAM package [22,23]
and the gam function (with its default values of smoothing
parameters) of the gam package to fit GAMs of VAS change
score [24,25].Then, the appropriate cut-off point for identifying
the threshold effect was chosen by locating the value at which
the smoothed curve crossed the horizontal line of Y axis = 0 in
the GAM plot. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve and the Youden index was used to verify the
appropriateness of the chosen cut-off point of baseline Kt/V
for predicting the aggravation of pruritus [26]. Additional linear
regression analysis was also conducted to incorporate this
threshold effect.
To ensure the quality of analysis results, basic model-fitting
techniques for (1) variable selection, (2) goodness-of-fit (GOF)
assessment, and (3) regression diagnostics were used in our
regression analyses. Specifically, the stepwise variable selection
procedure (with iterations between the forward and backward
steps) was applied to obtain the candidate final regression
model. All the relevant covariates, such as the covariates
measured at baseline and the change scores of covariates, were
put on the variable list to be selected, and the significance levels
for entry (SLE) and for stay (SLS) were set to 0.15 or larger to

be conservative. Then, the best final regression model was
identified manually by reducing the significance levels to 0.05.
The coefficient of determination, R2
, was computed to assess the
GOF of the fitted multiple linear regression model. Technically,
the R2 statistic (0#R2
#1) indicates how much of the response
variability is explained by the covariates included in the fitted
multiple linear regression model, and it equals the square of the
Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted
response values. Finally, the statistical tools for regression
diagnostics such as residual analysis, detection of influential
cases, and check for multicollinearity were used to discover
model or data problems.
Results
Patient Characteristics
A total of 111 patients completed this study, and their
demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The mean age of the study participants was 60.6611.7
years, with 53% being female and 29% diabetic. The distribution
of VAS scores at baseline and follow-up is shown in Figure 1.
Table 2 shows the laboratory and clinical data of the study
participants collected at baseline and at the end of the follow-up.
Compared with the laboratory parameters measured at baseline,
the blood levels of hematocrit, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase
were higher, while the blood levels of leukocyte count and albumin
were lower at follow-up (Table 2). Compared with the pruritus
intensity at baseline, 17 patients (15.3%) reported aggravated
pruritus, 37 patients (33.3%) reported unchanged pruritus, and 57
patients (51.4%) reported improved pruritus at follow-up. The
distribution of VAS change score between baseline and follow-up
is shown in Figure 2. The baseline VAS scores were not
significantly different (P = 0.31) between the participants who
completed the study (2.763.0) and those who dropped out
(3.163.1).
Table 3 shows the laboratory and clinical data of the study
participants with improved and unimproved pruritus severity
during the follow-up period. The baseline VAS score was higher in
patients with improved pruritus (4.962.6) than those with
unimproved pruritus (0.561.2). Patients with improved pruritus
had lower blood levels of phosphorus, ferritin, as well as product of
calcium and phosphorus, than those with unimproved pruritus at
follow-up.

Uremic Pruritus in Hemodialysis Patients
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71404

Factors Associated with Aggravation of Pruritus Intensity
Over Time
As listed in Tables 4, the regression analysis proceeded in two
steps to identify the predictors associated with the aggravation of
pruritus intensity over time. Regression model 1 considered only
the covariates measured at baseline, including gender, age, VAS
score of pruritus intensity, laboratory parameters, Kt/V, as well as
regimens and vintage of hemodialysis (Table 4). We found that
female gender, use of low-flux dialyzer, lower Kt/V at baseline,
lower blood levels of uric acid at baseline, lower baseline VAS
score, and higher blood levels of creatinine and preprandial
glucose at baseline were significantly associated with the aggrava￾tion of pruritus intensity. There was also a borderline positive
association between higher blood level of total bilirubin at baseline
and worsened pruritus (Table 4, model 1). This linear regression
model had a good fit to the data (R2= 0.736).
Regression model 2 considered both the covariates measured at
baseline and the change scores of covariates (Table 4). In addition
to higher blood level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at
baseline, lower Kt/V at baseline, and higher value in the product
of calcium and phosphate at baseline, we found that higher change
scores of uric acid and AST and a lower change score of fasting
glucose were significantly associated with the aggravation of
pruritus (Table 4, model 2). Compared to model 1, this linear
regression model had a better fit to the data (R2= 0.752).
The Threshold of Kt/V
The GAM plots adjusted for baseline covariates with and
without the change scores of covariates both revealed that baseline
Kt/V was negatively and approximately linearly associated with
the change score of VAS (Figure 3). In the absence of evidence to
determine a threshold value in the continuum of Kt/V for uremic
pruritus, we sought an appropriate cut-off value of the baseline
Kt/V associated with the aggravation of pruritus. In both GAM
plots, the functional dose of Kt/V (in red) intersected the zero
VAS score changes (in green) at a value of around 1.5. These
intersections indicate that a baseline Kt/V ,1.5 is associated with
the aggravation of pruritus intensity.
To further verify the appropriate threshold of Kt/V, we have
examined various cut-points of Kt/V on the dichotomous
outcomes of whether pruritus improved or not. The receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed an area under the
curve of 0.587 (95% confidence interval 0.480–0.695). By using
the Youden index, we have identified 1.515 to be the optimal cut￾point of Kt/V, with a sensitivity of 73.7% and specificity of 50%.
This cut-point is nearly the same as we have identified from the
Table 4. Linear regression analysis of predictors associated with the change score of pruritus intensity.

GAM plots. Therefore 1.5 should be an appropriate threshold
value of Kt/V for the aggravation of pruritus intensity.
Categorizing Participants by Kt/V at the Threshold of 1.5
According to the threshold determined by the GAM plots and
ROC curve, we further classified the participants into two
categories: those with baseline Kt/V ,1.5 and those with baseline
Kt/V $1.5. We then re-evaluated the predictors associated with
the aggravation of pruritus intensity in the regression model
considered only the covariates measured at baseline (Table 5,
model 3), and the model considered both the covariates measured
at baseline and the change scores of covariates (Table 5, model 4).
Models 3 and 4 (Table 5) identified the same set of significant
covariates associated with worsened pruritus as those of models 1
and 2 (Table 4), respectively. Moreover, they had compatible
GOF as indicated by R2
.
Discussion
This is the first prospective cohort study to investigate clinical
parameters and metabolic profiles for uremic pruritus in
hemodialysis patients using repeatedly measured data. In the
study, we have demonstrated that the aggravation of pruritus was
associated with lower Kt/V after adjusting for a variety of
confounding factors. We’ve also shown that the patients with
baseline Kt/V below 1.5 suffered from aggravation of pruritus
intensity.
The relationship between uremic pruritus and the doses of
hemodialysis remains controversial. Kt/V, the most commonly
used indicator for dialysis adequacy, assesses the clearance of small
molecules in uremic patients. Dyachenko and Hiroshige reported
that achieving a higher Kt/V might reduce the degree of pruritus
in hemodialysis patients [4,27], while studies reported by Zucker
or Duque did not support this beneficial effect [3,28]. However,
the conclusions by Zucker or Duque were limited due to no
adjustment of other confounding factors.
According to current guidelines, the target dose of Kt/V for
hemodialysis given three times weekly should be l.4 or above
[17]. These guidelines are based on randomized clinical trials or
large-scale observational studies mainly investigating the out￾comes of all-cause mortality, but not quality of life or intensity
of uremic pruritus [29–33]. Currently, there are no established
guidelines or consensuses regarding the optimal levels of Kt/V
to ameliorate pruritus in hemodialysis patients. The cut-off
value of 1.5 for Kt/V suggested by our study for pruritus is
slightly above the target levels of reducing mortality recom￾mended in clinical practice guidelines, which not only implies
that a Kt/V higher than the current standard may not further
improve survival but may improve the quality of life, but also
indicates that the clearance of pruritogenic substances could
influence the intensity of pruritus [4,34,35]. In addition, we
have found that the use of a high-flux dialyzer was associated
with alleviation of pruritus intensity. Compared with low-flux
dialyzers, a high-flux dialyzer more efficiently removes middle
molecules ranging in size from 1000 to 15,000 D and has been
shown to be associated with the improvement of plasma
lipolytic activities [36], as well as lower rates of amyloidosis
and mortality [37,38]. Our study results are consistent with
previous studies in demonstrating that uremic patients with
pruritus have higher blood levels of urea nitrogen and b2-
microglobulin than do patients without pruritus [4,8]. Nonethe￾less, further studies are warranted to identify pruritogenic
substances and potentially novel targets in order to help relieve
uremic pruritus.
This study has several limitations. First, we only analyzed the
participants who completed the follow-up of 5 years in the
cohort study, which was limited by the number of our study
participants and possibly influenced by informative censoring.
Second, data-dependent model building and GAM plot
construction intrinsically introduce several biases, including
selection bias. The cut-off value of baseline Kt/V from our
study has only been tested in the data set from which it was
derived. External validation in other cohorts, as well as
randomized clinical trials, are necessary to definitively determine
whether increasing dialysis dose relieves uremic pruritus and to
accurately identify the optimal dialysis dose and regimen. Third,
most of our study participants presented milder pruritus, with
the characteristics of pruritus intensity similar to other studies in
Figure 3. Identifying the appropriate threshold of baseline Kt/
V by the generalized additive models (GAM) plot. (A) The GAM
plot adjusted for the important covariates at baseline only (gender, Kt/
V, use of high-flux dialyzer, pruritus intensity, hematocrit, creatinine,
uric acid, fasting glucose, total bilirubin, and Ca6P).(B) The GAM plot
adjusted for the important covariates at baseline (Kt/V, pruritus
intensity, AST, and Ca6P) and the change scores of the covariates (uric
acid, fasting glucose, and AST). The solid red lines show nonlinearity of
multivariable-adjusted relation between baseline Kt/V and change score
of pruritus (with 95% confidence intervals shown in black dotted lines).
Pruritus intensity was assessed by visual analog scale scores. The little
vertical bars (i.e., rugs) on the horizontal axis of the GAM plots display
the distribution of individual observations. Both GAM plots identified
the value around 1.5 to be the appropriate threshold of baseline Kt/V
for uremic pruritus, which indicated start of the aggravation of pruritus
intensity began at Kt/V ,1.5.

recent years [16,28,39]. Further studies may be necessary to
explore the factors specifically associated with more severe form
of uremic pruritus. Fourth, this study was limited to the patients
receiving chronic hemodialysis. Whether the findings are also
applicable to the patients with chronic kidney disease or chronic
peritoneal dialysis requires the verification of additional studies.
Despite these limitations, the present study has several
strengths. This is the first prospective cohort study designed to
explore the aggravating and relieving factors associated with
uremic pruritus. The longitudinal study design and repeatedly
measured covariates offer several advantages in terms of
providing information about the temporal aspect of each
participant, increased statistical power, and estimates of a
greater range of conditional probabilities. As pruritus is a
subjective feeling and generally considered difficult to evaluate,
it is valuable to perform a longitudinal study to exclude time￾invariant unobserved individual differences. Furthermore, infor￾mation of a wide variety of potential confounding variables was
collected repeatedly during follow-up, which allowed for more
sufficient control of known potential confounders in our
analysis.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that dialysis adequacy
assessed by Kt/V is an independent predictor of pruritus intensity
in patients with maintenance hemodialysis. Furthermore, hemo￾dialysis with the target of Kt/V $1.5, as well as the use of high￾flux dialyzer, may play a role in reducing the severity of uremic
pruritus.
