Bone marrow plasticity revisited: protection 
or differentiation in the kidney tubule?
Diane Krause1 and Lloyd G. Cantley2

Epithelial organs such as the intestine and skin have a relatively high rate of
cell loss and thus require a reservoir of stem cells capable of both replacing
the lost epithelia and maintaining the reservoir.Whether the kidney has such
a stem cell niche has been a subject of greatinterest;the majority of data sug￾gestthat replacement of renal epithelial cells occurs via dedifferentiation and
proliferation of existing tubular cells, while some studies demonstrate the
presence of potential tubular stem cells in the renal interstitium. However,
recent reports have suggested that the bone marrow may also be a source of
stem cells for tubule turnover and/or repair.In this issue ofthe JCI, 2 groups
explore the role of endogenous cells versus bone marrow–derived cells in
mediating tubule repair.Duffield and colleagues demonstrate that bone mar￾row does contain cells capable of protecting the kidney from ischemic injury,
butfound thatthese cells do not act by directincorporation into the repaired
tubular segments (see the related article beginning on page 1743).In contrast,
Lin and coworkers found that some bone marrow–derived cells do appear to
incorporate into the injured tubule as epithelial cells (see the related article
beginning on page 1756).Importantly, both groups conclude thatthe major￾ity of tubule repair occurs via proliferation of endogenous renal cells rather
than incorporation of bone marrow–derived cells.
Cells derived from bone marrow 
may functionally participate 
in renal repair
In both humans and mice, data has been
obtained in support of the ability of cells
emanating from the bone marrow to
become renal epithelial cells. Several groups
have reported the presence of Y chromo￾some–positive renal tubular cells in kid￾neys of male patients who received a renal
transplant from a female recipient, which
suggests that cells from outside the kidney
can populate the renal tubule (1, 2). The
percentage of Y chromosome–positive renal
tubule cells ranged from 0.6–6.8% in one
study (1) and was about 1% in the other (2).
In female mice that had undergone bone
marrow transplantation from male donors,
Y chromosome–positive tubule cells that
expressed epithelial markers were reported
in one study to be present at low levels in
7.9% of the renal tubules (1) and in a dif￾ferent study to comprise up to 8% of renal
tubule cells (3). Following transplantation
ofwhole bone marrowfrom β-galtransgenic
Rosa mice intowild-type recipients, 2 studies
(including one by our group) reported that
3–6%ofrenaltubulesin the cortex and up to
20% in the medulla contained at least 1 cell
thatstained positive with X-gal 1 week after
ischemic renal injury (3, 4). As β-gal–positive
cells were not seen in kidneys that had been
subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in
the absence of bone marrow transplanta￾tion,the authors of both studiesinterpreted
thisresult assuggestive of a majorrole ofthe
bone marrowin tubular epithelial cellrepair.
Ourresultsfurther demonstrated thatinfu￾sion of lineage-negative bone marrow cells
could partially reverse the exaggerated rise
in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) seen in mice
that had been subjected to lethal irradia￾tion followed by I/R (4),which suggeststhat
these cells can play a functional role in the
recovery process.
The lineage-negative fraction of bone mar￾row contains multiple cell types, including
rare subpopulations of HSCs and marrow
stromal cells(MSCs, alternatively referred to
as mesenchymalstem cells). Particular atten￾tion has been focused in recent years on the
potential of bone marrow–derived stem cells
(BMSCs) to differentiate into and/or fuse
withother celltypes and thereby functionally
incorporate into nonhematopoietic organs
such as liver and lung (refs. 5, 6; reviewed in
ref. 7). Morigi and coworkersfound that the
MSC population of lineage-negative bone
marrowcells hasthe primary capacity to par￾ticipate in renal tubule repair, whereas the
HSC population mediates a lesser protective
effect (8). They demonstrated that infusion
of large numbers of male MSCs markedly
diminished the initial rise in BUN in the
setting of cisplatin-induced tubular injury
in female recipients and found Y chromo￾some–positive tubular cells in the kidneys
of these animals, although the percentage
of MSC-derived tubule cells was not stated.
Similar findings were reported by Herrera
and colleagues following transplantation of
GFP-expressing MSCs into mice that were
subjected to glycerol-induced tubular injury
(9). In their study, 22% of tubular cells were
found to be GFP-positive afterinjury.
Is the most important role of the 
bone marrow–derived cell protective 
rather than reparative in the kidney?
The study by Duffield et al. reported in this
issue of the JCI (10) demonstrates the ability
of purified MSCs to improve renal function
in an I/R model of acute tubular injury in
the mouse, but the authors noted an impor￾tant difference from the prior studies. They
found that the effects of transplanted MSCs
were independent of any direct contribution
to the renal parenchyma, either tubular or
endothelial in nature. Furthermore, using
3 separate approaches for tracking donor￾derivedcells(GFP,Ychromosome, andβ-gal),
they found that animals undergoing whole
bone marrow transplantation followed by
acute renal injury also failed to exhibit any
tubular cells derived from donor bone mar￾row, although they did find small numbers
of cells expressing endothelial markers that
were of bone marroworigin in the kidneys of
these animals(Figure 1).The absence of bone
marrow–derived endothelial cells in kidneys
from mice transplanted with purified MSCs
suggeststhatthe endothelial cells come from
a non-MSC fraction ofthe bone marrow.

The idea that MSCs may protect the
renal tubule without directly participat￾ing in tubule repair is supported by recent
work by Togel and coworkers (11). Using
fluorescently labeled MSCs, they found
that these cells protected the kidney from
ischemic injury but were detectable in the
renal microvasculature for only 1–2 days
after infusion and were not observed to
differentiate into tubular or endothelial
cells during the first 3 days. In contrast, the
present study by Lin and coworkers (12)
showsthat infusion of whole bone marrow
(that would be expected to contain very
few MSCs) failed to prevent ischemic renal
injury and raisesthe argument that protec￾tion may require the infusion (or mobiliza￾tion) of large numbers of MSCs.
Duffield and colleagues(10)suggest that
the β-gal–positive tubular cells reported in
prior studies may have been detected as a
result of increased intrinsic β-gal activity in
the injured tubule rather than the presence
of β-gal–positive bone marrow cells. They
also suggest that the Y chromosome–posi￾tive tubular cells detected in previousstud￾ies of female mice following transplanta￾Figure 1
Potential roles of bone marrow–derived cells in renal protection/repair. After ischemic injury, the brush border of proximal tubular cells is rapidly 
lost, followed by either dedifferentiation and proliferation of these cells or cell detachment and death due to necrosis or apoptosis. The observation 
that the initial decline in renal function following ischemic injury is markedly diminished in animals receiving large numbers of MSCs suggests that 
these cells act to prevent the acute phase of the injury either by directly inhibiting cell death and/or by preventing inflammatory cell influx (I). Once 
injury has occurred, repair of the tubule requires the dedifferentiation, migration, and proliferation of the surviving tubular cells. In addition, it has 
been proposed that resident renal stem cells participate in the reparative phase by migrating into the tubule and differentiating into epithelial cells 
(14). MSCs may direct this phase of tubule repair by secreting a factor (or factors) that promotes tubular cell dedifferentiation and proliferation or 
by stimulating the influx of resident stem cells (II). A second bone marrow cell type, possibly HSCs, appears to serve as a reservoir of endothelial 
progenitor cells, which potentially promotes endothelial repair and increases renal medullary blood flow (III). Finally, the possibility remains that 
bone marrow–derived cells can, very rarely, undergo differentiation into or fuse with existing tubular cells to directly participate in tubule repair. The 
infrequent occurrence of these last 2 processes suggests that they are not critical for functional recovery from acute ischemic renal injury.

tion of bone marrow from male donor mice
are likely artifacts of imaging caused by the
staining technique or the superimposition
of a tubular cell and an infiltrating bone
marrow–derived cell.
How can we use bone marrow–
derived cells to improve 
renal function?
The work by these 2 groups raises several
interesting and important questions. First,
why is the degree to which bone mar￾row–derived cells differentiate into renal
epithelial cells so different in the different
studies? Are the previous reports incorrect,
as suggested by the Duffield et al. study
(10), or is differentiation of bone marrow–
derived cells and/or their fusion with resi￾dent tubular cells an uncommon but real
occurrence that is dependent upon distinct
experimental conditions, as supported by
the present study by Lin et al. (12)?
Based on our recent studies using trans￾plantation of male bone marrow into
female recipients, we agree with Duffield
and colleagues (10) that the prior β-gal
studies markedly over-represented the con￾tribution of bone marrow–derived cells to
the repopulation of ischemically injured
tubules during the repair process, although
our reasoning behind this conclusion is
somewhat different from that of Duffield
et al. In our work, significant numbers of
β-gal–positive tubular cells were only seen
in the kidneys of animals that had received
a bone marrow transplant from a Rosa
donor mouse and only when those kidneys
had been subjected to I/R (4). However,
careful review of those kidney sections
revealed no β-gal–positive interstitial cells,
even though these cells should be clearly
detectable. Thus, we presently believe that
the β-gal–positive bone marrow cells that
have infiltrated the interstitium in response
to injury may leak the enzyme and/or prod￾uct,which is apparently then sequestered in
the nearby injured tubular cells. It remains
unclear whether this transfer of the β-gal
enzyme or the dye occurs due to a physio￾logically relevant communication between
the 2 cell types or is an artifact of fixation
or staining. The alternative possibility that
β-gal present in the circulation of these chi￾meric animals is filtered and taken up by
the proximal tubule cells appearslesslikely,
due to the large molecular weight of β-gal
(a homotetramer with predicted molecular
weight of 540 kDa) and the fact that we
failed to see these intensely stained tubular
cells in the contralateral kidney in experi￾ments in which only 1 kidney had been
ischemically injured (4).
Ultimately, regardless of the exact mecha￾nism forthe increased detection of β-gal pre￾viously reportedbyus(4) aswell asbyLinand
coworkers (3), the current studies by Duff￾ield et al. (10) and Lin et al. (12)suggest that
the β-gal model is unreliable for use in these
studies and has led to a significant overesti￾mation of the role of bone marrow–derived
cells in directly repairing injured tubules.
This conclusion, however, does not resolve
the question of whether bone marrow cells
ever contribute directly to tubule regenera￾tion. The results of the current study by Lin
and colleagues (12) are at odds with those
of Duffield et al. (10) in that they continue
to support this possibility by demonstrat￾ing the presence of Y chromosome–positive,
CD45-negative cells in the renal tubules of
female mice subjected to I/Rinjury and male
whole bone marrow transplantation. These
cells were located primarily in the proximal
tubule and expressed the proximal tubule
marker Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (LTA),
which supportsthe possibility that they had
differentiated into or fused with renal tubu￾lar cells. However,when Lin et al.transplant￾ed bone marrow from a transgenic mouse
that expresses enhanced GFP uniquely in
renal epithelium, no GFP-positive tubule
cells were found in the recipient mice after
ischemic injury.While a negative result using
this approach could be due to silencing of
the transgene in the bone marrow–derived
cells, it adds to the concerns that positive
results reported in other transplant models
might bedue tomisinterpretationor artifact.
Importantly, in agreement with the study by
Duffield et al., Lin and colleagues demon￾strate that the majority of the cellsthat were
dividing to repair the injured tubules came
from an endogenous cell population, rather
than from bone marrow–derived cells.
Thus, despite reports by multiple inves￾tigators of renal tubular cells that are bone
marrow–derived (1–4, 8, 9),the presentstud￾ies by Duffield et al. (10) and Lin et al. (12)
demonstrate that in vivo differentiation
of BMSCs into renal tubular cells may not
occur at all, or is at most a minor compo￾nent of the repair process after ischemic
injury. It remains to be seen whether recent
studies demonstrating significant numbers
of renal tubular cells derived from MSCs
following toxic tubular injury (8, 9) will be
confirmedwhen subjected to 3-dimensional
imagingwithdeconvolution.Inour opinion,
conclusive proof that bone marrow–derived
cells can differentiate into renaltubular cells
in vivowill be provided onlywhen these cells
are isolated and characterized at the pheno￾typic, genetic, and functional levels.
This leads to the second, and more clini￾cally important, question. If bone mar￾row–derived cells do not participate in renal
tubule repair by directly differentiating into
large numbers of tubular cells, what is the
mechanism by which they protect the kid￾ney from ischemic and/or toxic injury? The
observation in the Duffield et al. study that
bone marrow–derived cells can differenti￾ate into or fuse with endothelial cells (10)
suggests that augmentation of endothelial
repair in the vasa recta could be responsible
for the improved renal function following
MSC infusion in mice subjected to I/R. In
support of this possibility, Duffield et al.
demonstrate that culture ofthe MSCs under
conditionsthat promote in vitro differentia￾tion into endothelial cells was required for
their protective effect in vivo. However, even
underthese conditions,they failed to detect
donor MSCs in the kidney following I/R,
either in the tubules or the endothelium.
This result suggests that even though some
fraction of bone marrow–derived cells may
be capable of becoming vascular endothelial
cells in the ischemically injured kidney, this
process is unlikely to be important for the
protective effect provided by the MSCs.
Our ability to determine the exact mech￾anism by which MSCs protect the kidney
is presently hampered by our poor under￾standing of their identity. MSCs are typi￾cally characterized as nonhematopoietic
bone marrow–derived cells that adhere to
and proliferate on tissue culture dishes and
thus may or may not represent identical
cell populations when derived in different
laboratories(13). Defining a surface pheno￾type that allows purification of these cells
and determining which subpopulation of
MSCs actually possesses the ability to pro￾tect the kidney from injury will be impor￾tant for understanding the mechanism(s)
by which they protect ischemic tissues.
However, because the surface membrane
protein expression is dynamic on primary
cells in culture, defining a functional phe￾notype would be optimal.
The present results by Duffield et al. (10)
are most consistentwith the idea thatMSCs,
when cultured under the proper conditions
and given in sufficient numbers, secrete a
factor (or factors) that protects the existing
tubular cellsfrom apoptosis, promotestheir
proliferation, suppresses the inflammatory
response after reperfusion, or augmentsthe
influx and differentiation of endogenous

renal stem cells (Figure 1). The failure of
whole bone marrow to have this protective
effect(12) may be due to the extremely small
numbers of MSCs present in the bone mar￾row or the large numbers of inflammatory
cells infused in this preparation. It remains
unclear whether the protective effect of
MSCs requires them to leave the bone mar￾row and transit through the renal circula￾tion or whether these cells can exert protec￾tive effects from distant sites. Identifying
the protective factor(s) and the signals that
prompt MSCs to secrete it should now be a
priority in our attemptsto develop newther￾apeutic approaches for improving patient
outcomesfollowing acute renal failure.

Harlequin ichthyosis unmasked: 
a defect of lipid transport
Alain Hovnanian
Department of Medical Genetics and INSERM U563, Purpan Hospital, Toulouse, France.
Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) — the most severe form of keratinizing disorders,
often lethal in the neonatal period — is characterized by a profound thicken￾ing ofthe keratin skin layer, a dense “armor”-like scale that covers the body,
and contraction abnormalities of the eyes, ears, and mouth. In this issue of
the JCI, Akiyama et al. report that mutations in ABCA12 caused defective
lipid transport that significantly impacted normal development of the skin
barrier (see the related article beginning on page 1777). Lipid secretion was
recovered after corrective ABCA12 gene transfer into patient keratinocytes.
These results should allow for early prenatal diagnosis of HI and lend hope
to the possibility of a specific treatment for this devastating disorder.
Waring pointed to what is believed to be
the first harlequin fetus described in the
US in the diary of Reverend Oliver Hart
in 1750 (1). Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is
believed to be inherited in an autosomal￾recessive manner, and affected newborn
infants are encased in “armor”-like thick,
yellow plates of scales with deep red fis￾suring. The skin is pulled tight such that
the face loses its normal appearance and
appears frog-like, with eversion of the
eyelids (ectropion) and lips (eclabion)
and flattening of the ears and nose. The
extremities are swollen due to constric￾tion by massive thickening of the skin.
Liveborn infants usually die within the
first days of life from respiratory, infec￾tious, and/or dehydration-related com￾plications. Some patients treated with
retinoids, synthetic derivatives of vita￾min A, have survived and subsequently
develop severe ichthyosis. The cause of
HI, however, has remained elusive, and
late prenatal diagnosis has until now
relied on electron microscopic examina￾tion of tissue sampled by invasive fetal
skin biopsy.
Lipid transport: a likely suspect
Members of the ABCA subclass of the
large ABC transporter protein fam￾ily bind ATP for the active transport of
lipids across cell membranes against
a concentration gradient. ABCA1 has
been shown to be the causative gene in
Tangier disease, a disorder of cholesterol
transport between liver and other tis￾sues (2–5), while mutations in ABCA4
(expressed exclusively in photoreceptors
of the eye for the transport of retinol)
cause Stargardt disease, recessive retini￾tis pigmentosa, or cone-rod dystrophy,
in which the abnormal accumulation of
retinoids results in the development of
macular dystrophy and loss of central
vision (6–8).
Lipid processing in the skin is essential
for the protective function of the stra￾tum corneum, the most external layer of
the epidermis (9). Corneocytes, attached
to each other by corneodesmosomes and
embedded in intercellular lipid lamellae,
form a cornified layer that acts as a barrier
between the internal and external environ￾ment for bodily defense. The lipid lamel￾lae are derived from lamellar granules, the
