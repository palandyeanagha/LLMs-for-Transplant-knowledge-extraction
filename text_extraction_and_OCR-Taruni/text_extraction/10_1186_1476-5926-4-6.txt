Abstract
Background: In patients with chronic hepatitis C virus, liver biopsy is the gold standard for
assessing liver disease stage; nevertheless, it is prone to complications, some of them serious. Non￾invasive methods have been proposed as surrogate markers for liver fibrosis. It was shown that
serum hyaluronic acid (HA) level increases with the development for liver fibrosis. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of HA as well as to determine the HA level cut-off for
predicting the presence or absence of fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis.
Results: 405 patients with chronic hepatitis C were prospectively included with biomarker
measurement and liver biopsy done the same day: 151 in the training set (only biopsy lengths of 25
mm or more) and 254 in the validation set. For the discrimination of significant fibrosis, severe
fibrosis, and cirrhosis in the training set, the areas under curve (AUCs) were 0.75 ± 0.03, 0.82 ±
0.02, and 0.89 ± 0.03, respectively. Absence of significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis can
be predicted by HA levels of 16, 25, and 50 µg/l, respectively (with negative predictive values of
82%, 89%, and 100%, in the same order). Presence of significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and
cirrhosis can be predicted by HA levels of 121, 160, and 237 µg/l, respectively (with positive
predictive values of 94%, 100%, and 57%, in the same order).
Conclusion: In the validation set, HA was accurate in predicting significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis,
and cirrhosis with AUCs of 0.73, 0.77, and 0.97, respectively. Moreover, accurate HA level cut-offs
were defined for predicting significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Thus, the study
supports that HA level may be clinically useful as a non-invasive marker for liver fibrosis and/or
cirrhosis.

Background
Liver biopsy is currently recommended as the gold stand￾ard method of staging fibrosis in patients with chronic
hepatitis C [1,2]. The risk of developing cirrhosis depends
on the stage (degree of fibrosis) and the grade (degree of
inflammation and necrosis) observed in the initial liver
biopsy [3,4]. This procedure, however, is invasive and has
potential complications [5,6]. Non-invasive approaches
developed to assess histological samples include clinical
symptoms, routine laboratory tests, and radiolographic
imaging [7-10]. Several clinical studies have attempted to
identify serum markers that correlate with the degree of
fibrosis and thus could be used, with feasibility, in con￾junction with or in place of a liver biopsy [2-4,6,8,9]. The
serum markers of fibrogenesis include platelet count [11],
prothrombin time [12], the ratio of alanine aminotrans￾ferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels [8], gamma￾glutamyl transferase level [13], and serum albumin level
[14]. Fibrotest (FT) is a simple non-invasive panel of bio￾chemical markers for fibrosis and activity [15].
Another non-invasive approach relies on the measure￾ment of substances that regulate fibrosis or participate in
the generation of the liver extracellular matrix. The most
applicable include hyaluronic acid (HA) [16], type IV col￾lagen [17], N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen
[18], metalloproteinases [19], inhibitors of metalloprotei￾nases [19], and growth-transforming factor beta [20]. HA
is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan, which is
an essential component of extracellular matrix in virtually
every tissue in the body [21]. In the liver, HA is mostly
synthesized by the hepatic stellate cells and degraded by
the sinusoidal endothelial cells [6]. HA levels are
increased in chronic liver diseases [6]. In patients with
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), HA levels increase with
the development of liver fibrosis. Moreover, in patients
with cirrhosis, HA levels correlate with clinical severity
[7,10,11].
The first aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic
value of HA for significant fibrosis (F2-F4), severe fibrosis,
(F3F4) and cirrhosis (F4), in patients with HCV infection.
The second aim was to determine the serum HA level cut￾off to predict both presence and absence of F2-F4, F3F4,
and F4.
Results
Patients
The cohort included 405 patients. Table 1 shows the
patient characteristics at the time of liver biopsy. The
training and validation sets did not significantly differ in
any of the assessed variables. Of the patients, 47% (190/
405) had significant fibrosis (F2-F4), 24% (99/405) had
severe fibrosis (F3F4), and 6% (25/405) had cirrhosis.
Hyaluronic acid and fibrosis in the training set
Figure 1 shows HA levels and stages of fibrosis are well
correlated (Spearman r = 0.55 – p < .0001). Although
there is an overlap between HA levels and fibrosis deter￾mined by liver biopsy, there is a significant increase in HA
levels when considering F0 to F4 scores (Kruskal-Wallis –
p < 0.0001).
Fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis diagnosis
Figure 2 and 3 shows receiver operating characteristic
curves of discriminatory values of HA according to the
severity of liver fibrosis in the training and validation sets.
For the discrimination of fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cir￾rhosis in the training set, areas under curve (AUCs) were
(Mean ± SE) 0.75 ± 0.03, 0.82 ± 0.02, and 0.89 ± 0.03,
respectively. In the validation set, AUCs were 0.73 ± 0.03,
0.77 ± 0.04, and 0.97 ± 0.04, respectively.

Fibrosis
Two cut-off values were chosen for identifying absence
(less than 16 µg/l) and presence (greater than 121 µg/l) of
significant fibrosis (F2-F4). Applying the lower cut-off, the
presence of significant fibrosis could be excluded with a
high certainty as only 3 (17%) of the 18 patients with an
HA level below 16 µg/l had significant fibrosis, with a neg￾ative predictive value (NPV) of 83%. In the validation set,
11 (18%) of 60 patients with a score below 16 µg/l had
significant fibrosis (NPV of 82%). Applying the high cut￾off to the training group (HA greater than 121 µg/l), only
2 (13%) of the 15 patients with HA greater than 121 µg/l
had no fibrosis, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of
87%. In the validation set, 16 of the 17 patients with HA
greater than 121 µg/l had significant fibrosis (PPV of
94%) (Table 2).
Severe fibrosis
As for significant fibrosis diagnosis, 2 cut-off values were
chosen for identifying absence (less than 25 µg/l) and
presence (greater than 160 µg/l) of severe fibrosis (F3F4).
Applying the lower cut-off, only 3 (5%) of the 64 patients
with HA lower than 25 µg/l had severe fibrosis (NPV of
95%). In the validation set, only 13 (11%) of the 123
patients with HA lower than 25 µg/l had severe fibrosis
(NPV of 89%). Applying the higher cut-off (HA greater

than 160 µg/l) to the training set, 10 (NPV of 91%) out of
11 patients with HA greater than 160 µg/l had severe
fibrosis, and none of the 13 patients with HA greater than
160 µg/l from the validation set had severe fibrosis (PPV
of 100%) (Table 2).
Cirrhosis
Two cut-off values were chosen for identifying absence
(less than 50 µg/l) and presence (greater than 237 µg/l) of
cirrhosis (F4). Applying the lower cut-off, 100 (NPV of
99%) of the 101 patients with HA lower than 264 µg/l had
no cirrhosis. In the validation set, none of the patients
with HA lower than 50 µg/l had cirrhosis (NPV of 100%).
When applying the higher cut-off (237 µg/l) to the train￾ing set, a fair PPV of 71% was obtained for predicting the
presence of cirrhosis. The PPV was lower when applying
the cut-off to the validation set (PPV of 57%) (Table 2).
Discussion
Combining HA level with other serum markers for assess￾ing liver fibrosis has been considered in some other stud￾ies [22,23]. One of the interests of our study was to focus
on the diagnostic accuracy of HA alone in predicting
fibrosis and cirrhosis in HCV-infected patients.
In the present study, HA level was accurate in predicting
significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis, with
AUCs of 0.75, 0.82, and 0.89, respectively, in the training
set; and of 0.73, 0.77, and 0.97, respectively, in the valida￾tion set. Using values below the lower cut-off level or
above the higher cut-off level, one could predict absence
or presence of significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cir￾rhosis in 31%, 51%, and 78%, respectively, in the valida￾tion set patients. Therefore, it is likely that the association
of HA level with the degree of hepatic fibrosis represents
an indirect one, expressing the functional correlation
between fibrosis and both the concomitant capillarization
and hepatic hemodynamic changes.
Significant fibrosis can be predicted by a HA level of <16
µg/l for its absence (NPV of 82%) and of >121 µg/l for its
presence (PPV of 94%) in the validation set. Severe fibro￾sis can be predicted by a HA level of ≤ 25 µg/l for its
absence (NPV of 89%) and of >160 µg/l for its presence
(PPV of 100%). Cirrhosis can be predicted by an HA level
of ≤ 50 µg/l for its absence (NPV of 100%) and of > 237
µg/l for its presence (PPV of 57%). Considering a serum
HA cut-off of 60 µg/l for absence of cirrhosis diagnosis,
our data are in the same range as those of other studies
[3,24].
A cut-off value of 110 µg/l was suggested for separating
patients with and without cirrhosis [18]. Taking in consid￾eration this cut-off in our cohort of patients, a misclassifi￾cation of cirrhotic patients was observed in 23% (3/13)
(sensitivity of 77%) of patients with proven cirrhosis. This
difference may be due to the use of a different HA assay.
Our study included a sufficient proportion of patients
with significant fibrosis: 47% in the training set and 46%
in the validation set; however, the proportion of patients
with cirrhosis was low in the two sets: 7% and 5%, respec￾tively. The second limitation of this study is the number
of unclassified patients (between 22% and 69%).
Conclusion
This study showed that significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis,
and cirrhosis can be predicted by serum HA levels in
patients with HCV infection. The notion of routinely
measuring a marker that reflects the function of the sinu￾soidal endothelial cells, rather than the hepatocytes them￾selves, is an exciting concept. Serum HA would be
clinically useful as a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis
or cirrhosis in HCV-infected patients. It suffers from the
need to limit, as much as possible, potential confounding
variables such as the effects of exercise and eating.
Further studies conducted in a large cohort of cirrhosis
patients are needed to corroborate this study, namely
because few of our patients had cirrhosis and the cut-off
levels must be considered in an independent study. More￾over, a comparison of HA levels with other non-invasive

Methods
Study participants
The cohort included 405 patients (mean age 49 ± 13 years,
53% men) with HCV infection between November 2002
and December 2003, in five centers in southern France
[Conception Hospital and Saint-Joseph Hospital (Mar￾seille), Archet Hospital (Nice), Hyères Hospital (Hyères),
and Arnault Tzanck Institute (St Laurent du Var)]. HA
assessment was evaluated with data from 151 patients
(training group) and was validated in the remaining 254
patients (validation group). Only biopsy lengths of 25
mm or more were included in the training group, in
accordance with a recent study [25]; the remaining
patients were included in the validation set. None of the
patients had joint injuries, based on clinical examinations
and inflammatory markers estimated at the time of inclu￾sion in the study. None of the patients had renal impair￾ment, based on normal creatinine clearance (Cockroft
calculation).
Liver biopsies
Liver biopsy examination was performed in each center by
evaluating the stage of fibrosis and grade of activity
according to the METAVIR scoring system [26,27]. Liver
biopsies were histologically assessed in the local centers
and a second assessment of each biopsy was done in a ref￾erence laboratory. The second assessments were done by
the same pathologist. In this study, all liver biopsies were
re-staged by the central reference laboratory (n = 405). No
liver biopsies were found with more than one-stage differ￾ence between the local pathologist and the reference
pathologist. One-stage discordance is considered pathol￾ogy-dependent and thus not considered significant. Fibro￾sis was staged on a scale of 0 to 4: F0 = no fibrosis, F1 =
portal fibrosis without septa, F2 = portal fibrosis and few
septa, F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis, F4 =
cirrhosis.
Hyaluronic acid
HA levels were measured by Alphabio Laboratories, Mar￾seille, with the Corgenix Hyaluronic Acid Test Kit, Corge￾nix Inc., CO, following the manufacturer's instructions
(patients in fasting conditions, no physical effort). Each
HA level was measured in duplicate (range 1 to 871 µg/l)
and a pool control set was used. All serum samples were
obtained on the day of liver biopsy.
Statistical analysis
The association between HA levels and liver biopsy stag￾ing was measured with the Kruskal-Wallis multiple com￾parison test and with the Spearman rank correlation
coefficient. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Respec￾tive diagnostic values were reported by the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) (± standard
error mean), NPV, PPV, sensitivity, and specificity.
