Abstract
Immune functions were evaluated in vitro for PBMC isolated
from healthy donors and cultured with the antiviral agents, 3'-
azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), ribavirin, ganciclovir, 2'3'-
dideoxyinosine (ddl), or acyclovir. To identify methods for as￾sessing the effects of antiviral drugs on immune cells, the
PBMC response to mitogens, Con A, or phytohemagglutinin
was evaluated from measurements of [Hjthymidine and 11[C￾leucine incorporation, cell growth, cellular RNA, DNA, and
protein levels, and the PBMC proliferative cycle (i.e., progres￾sion from GO -- G1 -- S - G2 + M).
At clinically relevant concentrations, AZT, ribavirin, or
ganciclovir diminished PBMC responsiveness to mitogen. The
numbers of proliferating cells in G1, S., and G2 + M phases of
the cell cycle, DNA content, and VHjthymidine uptake were
decreased in cultures treated with AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclo￾vir. AZT or ribavirin but not ganciclovir reduced RNA and
protein in the cultures and inhibited cell growth. Whereas
AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir were antiproliferative, ddI or
acyclovir had little, if any, effect on PBMC mitogenesis. The
inhibitory effects of antivirals on immune cells may contribute
to the immune deterioration observed in patients following pro￾longed use of the drugs. (J. Clin. Invest. 1991. 87:1916-1924.)

Introduction
At present there are few safe and effective drugs for treatment
of viral diseases. Although antiviral activity has been demon￾strated in vitro for the nucleoside analogues 3'-azido-3'-deox￾ythymidine (Zidovudine; Vetrovir) (AZT),' ribavirin (1-beta￾D-ribofuranosyl- 1,2,4-trizole-3-carboxamide; Virazole), gan￾ciclovir (9-[1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl] guanine; DHPG;
BIOLF-62; 2NDG), and 2'3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), neither
their full therapeutic potential nor range of toxicity has been
evaluated ( 1-6). By virtue of their resemblance to thymidine,
adenosine, and guanosine, such nucleoside analogues are likely
to have adverse effects on mammalian DNA, RNA, and/or

protein synthesis, in addition to their effects on viral replica￾tion (2). Previous studies have shown many synthetic nucleo￾sides to be toxic on in vivo use (2); however, acyclovir (9-[2-
hydroxyethoxymethyl]guanine) which has low in vivo and in
vitro toxicity, is a notable exception (1). Acyclovir is now
widely used in renal and bone marrow transplant recipients for
prophylaxis and treatment of herpes simplex virus and vari￾cella zoster virus infections (1).
To date, AZT is the only approved drug for treatment of
HIV disease. Recent studies with ddI, however, have docu￾mented clinical improvements in HIV infected patients and
even low dose therapy with ddl has resulted in statistically sig￾nificant increases in CD4 cells and decreases in HIV p24 anti￾genemia (7-9). Ribavirin has been used in treatment ofrespira￾tory syncytial virus infection (10), influenza (1 1), and Lassa
fever (12), and ribavirin, like AZT and ddl, is currently under
evaluation for its effectiveness in treatment of HIV disease (13,
14). Ganciclovir, which has activity against many herpes group
viruses, is the first effective drug for treatment ofcytomegalovi￾rus retinitis in patients with AIDS (15).
The effects of nucleoside antiviral drugs on immune func￾tion have not been well defined. Although established cell lines
have been cultured with the antivirals (16), the findings from
such studies may not always reflect the activity ofthe drugs on
freshly isolated immune response cells. Some investigators
have analyzed PBMC responses in cultures treated with the
nucleoside antivirals, but these studies have relied on uptake of
labelled DNA/RNA precursors to assess the effects exerted by
the drugs (4, 16-18). Since these antivirals probably alter intra￾cellular nucleotide pools (2), the levels of incorporation for
DNA/RNA precursors may not parallel the degree of DNA/
RNA synthesis in the cells, and consequently, may not be valid
indicators ofcellular functions. For these reasons we have used
a series of assays to evaluate, in vitro, the effects of AZT, riba￾virin, ganciclovir, acyclovir, and ddl on the immune response
of PBMC obtained from normal, healthy donors. PBMC re￾sponsiveness to T cell mitogens, Con A, or PHA, was measured
and the effects of the antiviral drugs were assessed on the
PBMC uptake of [3H]thymidine and ['4C]leucine, blastogene￾sis, the RNA, DNA, and protein content of activated cultures
and stages of the proliferative cycle for lectin-stimulated lym￾phocytes. Our studies show that AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir
were inhibitory for cultured PBMC, diminishing their respon￾siveness to mitogens.
Methods
Isolation of PBMC. PBMC were separated from whole, heparinized
blood obtained by venipuncture from healthy volunteer donors. 30-ml
portions of blood were layered over 15 ml of lymphocyte separation
medium (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) and after centrifuga￾tion, cells at the interface were collected, and then washed twice in

HL- I culture medium (Ventrex Laboratories, Inc., Portland, ME) sup￾plemented with 2 mM glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomy￾cin (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island NY).
Antiviral drugs. Sources for the antivirals used in these studies were:
AZT (Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC); riba￾virin (Viratek, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA); ganciclovir (Syntex Laboratories
Inc., Palo Alto, CA); acyclovir (Burroughs Wellcome Co.); and ddI
(Calbiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA). These agents were prepared
in HL-I medium as stock solutions at 2-4 x Il0' M and serially diluted
before assay.
[3H]thymidine uptake. PBMC (10) were dispensed in 100-,gl por￾tions of culture medium to 96-well flat-bottom microdilution plates
(Falcon Labware, Becton, Dickinson, & Co., Oxnard, CA) and then
activated by the addition of 50 ,1 of an 8-gg/ml preparation of Con A
(Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO) or PHA (Difco Laboratories Inc.,
Detroit, MI). The antiviral drugs were added in 50-id vols and the
cultures then incubated for 3 d at 370C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Subsequently, [3H]thymidine (50 ul; 1 MCi) (New England Nuclear,
Boston, MA) was added, and the incubations continued for an addi￾tional 12 h. In studies designed to measure the kinetics for [3H]thymi￾dine incorporation the cells were incubated for periods of 2-6 d; [3HJ￾thymidine was present for the final 4 h of the culture period. Incuba￾tions were terminated by aspiration ofculture medium and transfer of
the PBMC to filters by use of a cell harvester. Subsequently, the filters
were dried and then counted in a liquid scintillation counter.
Two-color analysis ofthe cell cycle. Cultures were initiated by the
transfer of 106 PBMC suspended in 1 ml of HL-I medium to 24-well
plates (Costar, Data Packaging Corp., Cambridge, MA). PBMC were
activated by the addition of2 ,g/ml (final) ofCon A, the antiviral drugs
were added, and then the cultures were incubated at 370C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere for 3 d. Subsequently, PBMC were labelled for DNA and
RNA by use of the double-staining method previously described by
Shapiro (19). Cells (106/ml) were suspended in a 5-MM solution of the
DNA-specific dye Hoechst 33342 (HO) (Sigma Chemical Co.), dis￾solved in HL-l medium, and then incubated for 45 min at 370C in a
5% CO2 atmosphere. The RNA-specific fluorochrome pyronin Y (PY)
(Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) was then added (5 MM, final
concentration) and the incubations continued for an additional 45
min. Following two washes with cold PBS supplemented with 5 juM
PY, cells were fixed with 2% formalin and stored in the dark at 4VC
until analyzed.
DNA and RNA content ofthe PBMC was analyzed by dual fluores￾cence flow cytometry as previously described (19, 20). HO blue fluores￾cence (Fl) and PY red Fl were simultaneously recorded from individual
cells using a 455 BP and 610 filter, respectively. Data were collected
and stored in list mode using a dual laser Epics 750 Series flow cytom￾eter (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL). Subsequently, the data
were transferred to an HP 9000 computer for analysis and display using
LYSYS software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems,
Mountain View, CA) with cell cycle positions determined according to
methods described by Darzynkiewicz and Traganos (20, 21).
Blast cells formed in response to lectin. PBMC were activated with
Con A and cultured with or without the antiviral drugs for 3 d as
described above (see: Two-color analysis ofthe cell cycle). Large lym￾phocytes were distinguished from small resting ones by the analysis of
forward and 900 light scatter parameters (22) acquired on an Epics 750
series flow cytometer using MDADS based software (Coulter Electron￾ics, Inc.).
Protein assays. Protein content for the PBMC was measured by the
technique of Crissman and Steinkamp (23). PBMC (106/ml) were sus￾pended in a solution of S Mg/ml (final) rhodamine 640 perchlorate
(R640) (Exciton, Inc., Dayton, Ohio) dissolved in culture medium and
then incubated for 90 min at 370C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Subse￾quently, the cells were fixed with 2% formalin and stored in the dark at
4VC until analyzed. Protein content for the R640 stained cells was
determined by flow cytometric analysis. R640 emission was recorded
using a 570 long pass filter on an Epics 750 series flow cytometer and
analyzed using MDADS based software (Coulter Electronics, Inc.).
Protein synthesis was measured from incorporation of [4C]leucine
(New England Nuclear) into the cellular components precipitated by
5% cold TCA. PBMC (106) were harvested from cultures after a 3-d
incubation with Con A (2 Ag/ml) or the lectin + antiviral and trans￾ferred in I -ml portions ofthe culture supernatant to 5-ml test tubes. 20
Ml (1 MCi) of ['4C]leucine was added to each tube and the tubes were
incubated for 5 h at 370C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were then
pelleted by centrifugation, culture medium removed by aspiration, and
the cell pellets washed three times in 2 ml of cold 5% TCA. Subse￾quently, the precipitate was dissolved in 1 ml of a solution containing
10-3 M EDTA, l0-3 M NaHCO3, and 2% SDS, transferred to 10 ml of
Biofluor liquid scintillant (New England Nuclear), and then counted in
a scintillation counter.
Results
AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir, but not acyclovir or ddL, were
potent inhibitors of[3fHthymidine uptake in cultures oflectin￾activated PBMC. The addition of AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclo￾vir to cultures ofCon A-activated PBMC resulted in a marked
decrease in uptake of[3H]thymidine (Fig. 1, A-C). At low doses
(i.e., < 4 MM) AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir diminished [3H]-
thymidine incorporation and high doses (40-400 AM) abro￾gated the uptake of this labelled DNA precursor (Fig. 1, A-C).
Whereas low doses of AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir reduced
labelling, acyclovir caused only a modest decrease (i.e., on
average a 50% reduction) in [3H]thymidine uptake at the 400-
MM dose (Fig. 1, A-D). Interestingly, ddl, unlike the other anti￾virals, had little, if any, effect on the [3H]thymidine incorpo￾rated in PBMC cultures (Fig. 1, A-E).
[3H]thymidine incorporation for PBMC stimulated with
PHA, like that for Con A, was markedly reduced for cultures
incubated with AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir (data shown for
AZT and ddI; see Fig. 1 F). Acyclovir caused a modest impair￾ment in labelling at the 400-MM dose and ddI had no effect on
[3H]thymidine uptake in PHA or Con A-activated cultures
(Fig. 1 E and F).
The kinetics for [3H]thymidine uptake by the PBMC were
unchanged in cultures incubated with the antivirals. The data
of Fig. 1 F show the effects of AZT and ddl on the time course
for [3H]thymidine uptake in PBMC cultures established from a
single donor and activated with PHA (1 Mg/ml); labelling
peaked on day 4 and waned by day 6 in cultures incubated with
or without drugs and, therefore, the effects of the antivirals on
[3H]thymidine uptake were not merely the result of a shift in
the kinetics of the lectin response.
AZT, ribavirin, organciclovir, but not acyclovir or ddI, were
potent inhibitors ofthe PBMCproliferative response to lectin.
Upon stimulation with mitogen lymphocytes enter the prolifer￾ative cycle; quiescent cells (GO) undergo change to an activated
state (GI), then progress through subsequent stages (S, G2) to
mitosis (M), and in turn, the resulting daughter cells enter the
cycle (24). To measure lymphocyte proliferation and to assess
the effects exerted by antiviral drugs on this immune function
we determined the numbers of resting GO or cycling cells in the
GI, S, G2, or M phases of the proliferative cycle in cultures of
Con A-stimulated PBMC. Cell position (GO, GI, S G2 + M)
in the cycle was ascertained from measurements of DNA and
RNA. A double labelling technique was used to differentially
stain DNA with one fluorochrome and RNA with another, and
then, the DNA and RNA content for individual cells was mea￾sured by dual fluorescence flow cytometry. DNA was labelled
with the DNA-specific HO dye that stains viable cells and

Figure 1. AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir, but not acyclovir or ddl, were potent inhibitors of [3Hlthymidine uptake in lectin-stimulated cultures of
PBMC. PBMC (1O0) were activated by the addition of 2 ,g/ml of Con A (A-E) or PHA (F) and cultured with the antiviral drugs at the concen￾trations indicated for 3 d (A-E) or (as shown for panel F) periods of 2, 4, or 6 d. [3H]thymidine (1 gCi) was present in the cultures for the final 12
h (A-E) or 4 h (F) ofthe culture period. All data points were determined from the arithmetic means of results obtained for four replicate cultures.
(Standard deviations for the mean values were < 5%.)
under the conditions employed for these studies (described in
Methods) is a stoichiometric stain for DNA (19). PY was em￾ployed for staining cytoplasmic RNA. Activated PBMC that
were synthesizing DNA (S) or that had completed a round of
synthesis, but as yet not separated into daughter cells (G2 + M),
were distinguished by virtue oftheir greater DNA content from
nonactivated, quiescent cells (GO). Cells in G1, defined as those
synthesizing RNA but not DNA, were readily distinguished
from those in GO (resting), S, or G2 + M since DNA and RNA
were simultaneously measured for individual cells. This double
staining technique and dual fluorescence flow cytometry en￾abled us to enumerate the cells in GO, G1, S, or G2 + M com￾partments of the cycle and thereby to measure proliferation in
the cultures. By then comparing the proliferative response (i.e.,
number of cells in the compartments of the cycle) for drug￾treated and nontreated cultures, we determined the antivirals'
effects on PBMC proliferation.
Cultures established from five donors are shown as two pa￾rameter histograms in Fig. 2, which depicts the position ofcells
in the proliferative cycle as defined by their relative DNA and
RNA content. Data of Fig. 2 are presented for control cultures
in which the PBMC were maintained in medium alone, for
Con A-stimulated cultures incubated without drugs, and for
Con A-stimulated cells that were treated with AZT, ribavirin,
ganciclovir, acyclovir, or ddI. Data for the Con A cultures incu￾bated with or without drugs are also included in the line grafts
of Fig. 3. As expected, nonstimulated PBMC incubated in me￾dium alone (see histograms labelled Medium, nonstimulated;
Fig. 2) were almost exclusively positioned in GO (Fig. 2). Since
Con A-stimulated cultures (see histograms labelled Con A￾drug, Fig. 2) had entered the proliferative cycle, cells were ob￾served in the G1, S, G2 + M, as well as GO compartment, a
distribution pattern characteristic for proliferating lympho￾cytes (24).
Addition ofAZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir to the Con A-ac￾tivated cultures resulted in aberrations in the proliferative cycle
(Figs. 2 and 3). As can be clearly seen in the histograms depict￾ing the effects of AZT (Fig. 2) at doses as low as 0.4 ,gM AZT
interrupted the progression of cells through the proliferative
cycle (i.e., from GO to G1, S to G2 + M and G2 + M to GO). At

Figure 2. AZT, ribavirin, or gan￾ciclovir, but not acyclovir or ddI,
caused marked abnormalities in
the proliferative cycle of Con A￾activated PBMC. PBMC (106)
were cultured in medium alone,
Con A (2 ,g/ml), or lectin + an￾tiviral drug for 3 d. Cells were
then double labelled with fluoro￾chromes specific for DNA (HO)
and RNA (PY). HO blue F1 and
PY red F1 were measured by dual
fluorescence flow cytometry.
Data are presented as two pa￾rameter histograms representing
the distribution of PBMC in re￾lation to their relative DNA (HO
Fl) and RNA (PYFI) content.
Histograms depict distributions
for 25,000 cells.
0.4AM AZT the boundary between GO and GI phases was
obliterated and, in addition, the S and G2 + M compartments
were enlarged with an excessive number of cells. At increased
doses (2 4 AM) AZT diminished the DNA content of the cul￾tures and caused deficiencies in the S and G2 + M compart￾ments of the proliferative cycle (Figs. 2 and 3).
Inspection of the histograms presented in Fig. 2 shows that
ribavirin, like AZT, induced anomalies in the PBMC prolifera￾tive cycle. Ribavirin at 0.4AM caused an enlargement in the
G2 + M compartment suggesting a defect in either the transi￾tion from G2 to M or in cell division (M) itself (Figs. 2 and 3).
When the ribavirin concentration was increased 10-fold to 4
MM there were anomalies in GI and S, and when further in￾creased 100-fold to 40 MM, the total numbers of cycling cells
measured for Gl, S, and G2 + Mwere markedly reduced (Figs.
2 and 3).
Ganciclovir at doses of 4 AM caused a detectable, albeit
modest, decrease in the S and G2 + M compartments of the
proliferative cycle (Fig. 2). When the ganciclovir concentration
in the cultures was increased by 10-fold to 40 AM the numbers
of cells in the S and G2 + M phases of the cycle were further
reduced. At 400MM ganciclovir the numbers ofcycling cells in
GI, S, and G2 + M compartments diminished (Figs. 2 and 3).
Whereas low doses (0.4 to 4 MM) of AZT, ribavirin, or gan￾ciclovir caused abnormalities in the proliferative cycle (Figs. 2
and 3), equivalent concentrations ofacyclovir or ddl had little,
ifany, effect on the proliferative response ofPBMC (Figs. 2 and
3). In fact, acyclovir or ddl were only inhibitory at high doses
(. 40 MM) (Figs. 2 and 3).
Our studies in which the proliferative cycle was analyzed by
two-color staining for DNA and RNA clearly showed that in￾cubation of lectin-stimulated PBMC with AZT, ribavirin, or
ganciclovir resulted in abnormalities in the cell cycle and di￾minished proliferation. These findings are in agreement with
our data in which PBMC proliferation was measured indirectly
by [3Hlthymidine incorporation (Fig. 1) and therefore they
serve to substantiate our results obtained with the labelled
DNA precursor.
AZTor ribavirin, but not ganciclovir, acyclovir, or ddl, were
potent inhibitors ofPBMC transformation to ConA blasts. Lec￾tin-stimulated transformation oflymphocytes from small (rest￾ing) to large blast cells was markedly diminished in PBMC

Figure 3. PBMC progression through the cell cycle was markedly impaired by AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir, but not acyclovir or ddM. DNA and
RNA content for PBMC incubated with Con A or Con A + antiviral drug was measured by double staining and dual fluorescence flow cytometry
as described for Fig. 2. Cell cycle position (Gl, S, and G2 + M) was then determined for the PBMC from measurements of their DNA and
RNA as described for Fig. 2; 25,000 cells were analyzed for each culture. Data are shown as number of cells in the sample in GI (upper panels),
S (middle panels), and G2 + M (lower panels) compartments of the proliferative cycle vs. drug concentration. The broken lines connect values
measured for PBMC incubated with a 0.4-MM dose of drug to the matched controls cultured without drug (i.e., 0 concentration); these lines point
out the effects of 0.4-MuM doses of the antivirals on the PBMC obtained from individual donors.
cultures incubated with AZT or ribavirin, but not ganciclovir,
acyclovir, or ddI (Fig. 4). AZT, at doses as low as 4 AM, de￾creased the number of Con A blasts in PBMC cultures, and as
the concentration of AZT was increased, blast formation was
further diminished (Fig. 4 A). Ribavirin, like AZT, inhibited
blastogenesis; inhibition was detected in cultures incubated
with 12 uM ribavirin, and the response was abolished in cul￾tures incubated with 400 MM ribavirin (Fig. 4 B).
It is noteworthy that we employed cytofluorometry (i.e.,
measured forward and right angle light scatter) to measure the
number ofblast cells in the cultures, and therefore, these mea￾surements were obtained without aid of DNA precursors (e.g.,
[3Hlthymidine) or other labelling agents (e.g., HO stain for
DNA). These studies eliminate the possibility that the effects
measured for AZT or ribavirin on PBMC responsiveness to
lectin resulted solely from artifacts caused by way ofdrug com￾petition with nucleoside precursors or other interference with
labelling procedures.
Whereas AZT and ribavirin were inhibitory, ganciclovir,
acyclovir, or ddI (data shown for ganciclovir or ddI; Fig. 4, C
and D) had only a modest, if any, effect on blastogenesis. Only
at high doses (400 MM) did ganciclovir, acyclovir, or ddI cause
any diminution in the number of blast cells in the Con A￾stimulated cultures (Fig. 4, C and D).
Ribavirin or AZT, but not ganciclovir, acyclovir, or ddI,
reduced the protein content of Con A-activated PBMC. Al￾though ribavirin was the more potent inhibitor, the incubation
of Con A-activated PBMC with ribavirin or AZT diminished
the protein content of the cultures (Fig. 5, A and B). The drug
concentration that resulted in a 50% reduction in protein (Ie)
was 100 MM for ribavirin and 400 ,uM for AZT; the inhibitory
effect titered to 4-MM doses of ribavirin or AZT (Fig. 5, A and
B). Neither acyclovir nor ddI, on the other hand, reduced the
level of protein in the lectin-activated cultures at doses < 400
MM (Fig. 5, A and B).
The decreased levels of protein in the ribavirin-treated cul￾tures resulted from a decline in protein synthesis since incorpo￾ration of ['4Cjleucine into the protein fraction precipitated by
TCA was reduced in cultures incubated with ribavirin (Fig. 6).
[14C]leucine uptake was diminished at doses of 4 MM ribavirin

Figure 4. Con A-stimulated blastogenesis was inhibited in PBMC
cultures incubated with AZT or ribavirin, but not ganciclovir, acy￾clovir, or ddM. Con A cultures were initiated and then incubated for 3
d as described for Fig. 2. Con A blasts were distinguished from small
resting cells in the cultures by flow cytometry and analysis of forward
and 90° degree light scatter. Samples of 25,000 cells from each culture
were analyzed; data are shown as numbers ofblast cells in the samples.
and was abrogated when the ribavirin dose was increased to
400 ,uM (Fig. 6). Unlike ribavirin, neither ganciclovir nor acy￾clovir diminished protein synthesis since neither agent reduced
the level of ['4C]leucine in TCA precipitates (Fig. 6).
Discussion
Recovery from viral disease is closely linked to immune func￾tion, especially T lymphocyte activity (25-27), and since syn￾thetic nucleoside antivirals have potential toxicity, particularly
on rapidly dividing cells, we have studied the effects of AZT,
ribavirin, ganciclovir, ddl, and acyclovir on mitogen-stimu￾lated immune cells. The responsiveness ofPBMC isolated from
normal, healthy donors was measured for cultures incubated
with or without these agents.
As expected, our findings showed that acyclovir, an anti￾viral drug that has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo
(1, 17), had little effect on PBMC responsiveness to mitogen
(Figs. 1-3, 5). Toxicity was observed only with high acyclovir
doses; intravenous administration of acyclovir doses of 5-15
mg/kg body wt result in plasma levels of 40-92 AM (28) and
our studies showed that at these concentrations the PBMC pro￾liferative response was reduced only 10-20% (Figs. 1-3, 5).
Interestingly, ddI had minimal toxicity even in cultures treated
with high (supratherapeutic) doses of drug (Figs. 1-5).
Whereas the PBMC response to Con A was largely unaf￾fected by acyclovir or ddl, AZT, ribavirin, or ganciclovir di￾minished the lectin response (Figs. 1-6). The addition ofAZT,

Figure 5. Protein content for Con A-activated PBMC was diminished
by AZT or ribavirin, but not ganciclovir, acyclovir, or ddl. PBMC
were activated with Con A and cultured with or without the drugs as
described for Fig. 2. Cell protein was labelled by incubation of the
PBMC with the fluorogenic dye R640. Red F1 emitted from cell asso￾ciated R640 was measured by flow cytofluorometry and the number
of Con A-activated cells that had undergone protein synthesis was
determined from comparisons of the R640 Fl emitted from stimu￾lated and nonstimulated (PBMC maintained in culture medium
alone) cultures. The effects of the antivirals on the protein content of
activated cultures was measured by comparisons between PBMC in￾cubated with or without drugs. Samples of 25,000 cells from each
culture were analyzed. Data are shown as per cent control for R640
Fl [(number of cells with increased R640 F1 in Con A + drug cul￾tures)/(number of cells with increased red F1 in Con A - drug cul￾tures) X 100%].
ribavirin, or ganciclovir to the PBMC cultures resulted in the
decreased uptake of [3H]thymidine (Fig. 1) and quantitative
defects in the proliferative cycle (Figs. 2 and 3). It is noteworthy
that exposure to low doses (0.4-4 ,M) of AZT, ribavirin, or
ganciclovir impaired lymphocyte functions since in vitro cul￾tured cells are exposed to a fixed drug concentration; however,
in vivo the circulating level ofdrug may be rapidly diminished.
AZT or ribavirin, but not ganciclovir caused marked de￾creases in the growth of Con A blasts (Fig. 4), and the RNA
(Figs. 2 and 3) and protein content (Fig. 5) of activated cells.
Bowden et al. (18) reported previously that addition of ganci￾clovir to PBMC cultures reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation
but not elaboration of lymphokines, an immune function that
is dependent upon RNA and protein synthesis. Sommadossi
and Carlisle (29) reported that the in vitro addition ofganciclo￾vir to human hematopoietic progenitor cells, including granu￾Inhibition ofImmune Functions by Antiviral Drugs 1921

locytes, macrophages, and erythrocytes decreased their growth.
Taken together these studies indicate that ganciclovir may be
toxic for rapidly dividing populations of blood cells and their
precursors. Our findings show that the effects ofganciclovir are
targeted primarily on the S and subsequent G2 + M (but not
GI) phases of the proliferative cycle (Figs. 2 and 3), and there￾fore, the ganciclovir toxicity probably results from its effect(s)
on DNA synthesis.
Our studies show that AZT is a potent inhibitor of the
PBMC response to mitogens; this drug decreased cell uptake of
[3Hjthymidine, caused defects in the cell cycle, reduced growth
of Con A blasts, and diminished the protein content in the
cultures (Figs. 1-6). Mitsuya et al. (16) studied the effects of
AZT on the growth of an established T helper cell line (ATH8)
and they reported little difference between the viability for drug
treated or nontreated cultures. It is possible that the established
T cell line used for their studies was resistant to AZT toxicity
since such resistance has been reported for other established
cell lines (22, 30). Mitsuya et al. (16) also presented data on
[3H]uridine uptake into RNA for mitogen-stimulated PBMC
established from one healthy donor. Inspection of these data
showed that at 10MM AZT caused a detectable reduction in the
level of [3H]uridine incorporated in PHA or Con A-activated
cultures. Our studies, in which the RNA content ofPBMC was
determined by fluorescent staining and flow cytometry,
showed that AZT diminished RNA; this effect was dose depen￾dent and the inhibition titered to AZT doses of 4 MM (see
Fig. 3).
At present AZT is the only drug demonstrated to be effec￾tive in treatment of HIV infection; however, long term or high
dose therapy with AZT has resulted in severe toxicity, particu￾larly anemia and neutropenia (31). Peak plasma levels attained
for high dose AZT range between 6 and 10 MAM (32). We find
that AZT caused abnormalities in the proliferative cycle oflec￾tin-stimulated PBMC at concentrations as low as 0.4 AM (Figs.
2 and 3), and our studies, as well as those of Mitsuya et al. (16),
have indicated that therapeutic levels ofAZT inhibit RNA syn￾thesis in PBMC cultures. Taken together, these findings suggest
that AZT may adversely affect immune functions dependent
on proliferation or RNA and protein synthesis (e.g., elabora￾tion of lymphokines). In AIDS, where viral replication occurs
in immune response cells, it is possible that the toxicity result￾ing from such an antiviral may be enhanced. Since patients
with HIV disease have cellular immune deficiencies at the out￾set of treatment, any agent that further depresses the immune
response may, particularly over the long term, provide little
value to the patient.
Recent studies (33, 34) have shown that in patients with
AIDS or the AIDS related complex (ARC) low doses (300 mg)
of AZT cause less toxicity than higher doses (600-1,500 mg)
but provide the same clinical and virologic effects as the higher
doses. Fischl et al. (33) reported that in the AIDS patients
treated with AZT the numbers of CD4 cells are transiently
increased but subsequently diminished after 8 wk of therapy.
The studies of Collier et al. (34) have shown that in patients
with ARC the greatest improvement in mean CD4 lymphocyte
counts was in patients treated with low doses of AZT. It is
noteworthy that our studies point out the dose-dependent ef￾fects ofAZT on lymphocytes, and therefore our findings would
have predicted less toxicity with the low dose of AZT as has
been recently demonstrated in clinical trials (33, 34). The
methods used-in our studies may be applicable to the study of
other new antiviral compounds, and "prescreening" tests such
as those we have used here could be performed before the clini￾cal use of systemic antiviral agents.
We find that ribavirin, like AZT, diminished PBMC respon￾siveness to lectin. Our studies, as well as those of others (35),
have shown that ribavirin inhibits [3H]thymidine incorpora￾tion by cultured cells. Drach et al. (35) reported previously that
in ribavirin-treated cultures [3H]thymidine was not a reliable
measure for DNA synthesis. These investigators found that in
cultures of the KB cell line ribavirin inhibited [3H]thymidine
uptake by blocking the conversion of [3H]-labelled deoxythy￾midine diphosphate to the [3H]-labelled triphosphate and that
this drug at concentrations < 50MM had little effect on cellular
uptake of [32P]phosphate. Although no data were presented,
Drach et al. (35) reported that results obtained for Con A￾stimulated lymphocytes were identical to those obtained for
KB cells. Our studies show that ribavirin decreased protein
synthesis (Fig. 6), diminished the capacity of lectin-stimulated
PBMC to progress through the cell cycle (Figs. 2 and 3), and
reduced blastogenesis (Fig. 4). Defects in the cell cycle resulted
when PBMC were incubated with ribavirin doses of0.4 ,M; at
this low dose (0.4 MM) ribavirin caused activated PBMC to
accumulate in the G2 + M compartment indicating a block at
these stages of the proliferative cycle. At the higher 4-MuM dose
ribavirin reduced the number of cells in S, and as ribavirin was
further increased to 40MgM, the numbers in Gl and G2 + M, as
well as those in S, were diminished (Figs. 2 and 3) indicating
that ribavirin was a potent inhibitor of the proliferative re￾sponse. In addition to measuring (3H]thymidine uptake, we
1922 W. Heagy, C. Crumpacker, P. A. Lopez, and R. W. Finberg

have quantitated the DNA, RNA, and protein content ofcells,
analyzed stages of the cell cycle, counted blasts, and measured
protein synthesis in the cultures and ribavirin, by all methods
employed, was inhibitory (Figs. 1-6). We have employed
highly sensitive methods to assess the effects ofribavirin on the
PBMC response to lectin and differences between the method￾ologies used by Drach et al. (35) and us most likely account for
the disparities between these studies.
In clinical trials where patients with AIDS or ARC have
been treated with oral ribavirin doses of 600-800 mg/d and in
which steady-state serum levels were maintained between 8
and 10 uM the p24 antigen was decreased and the CD4 cell
number and lymphocyte proliferative response to lectin were
enhanced (13, 36). With higher dose regimens of 1,200 to 1,600
mg/d of ribavirin the steady-state serum levels were greater
than 13 ,gM and the CD4 cell number, lymphoproliferation, or
p24 antigen status showed no improvement (36). In fact, Rob￾erts et al. (37) have reported that the lymphocyte counts de￾creased in the patient group treated with 1,200 to 1,600 mg/d
of ribavirin suggesting possible lymphocyte toxicity. Interest￾ingly, our studies show that ribavirin inhibition of the PBMC
response to lectin was dose dependent and that responsiveness
declined precipitously in cultures incubated with ribavirin con￾centrations > 12 MM. It is possible that the treatment failure
observed with higher ribavirin doses is linked to the toxicity of
this agent on immune functions and that lower doses of the
drug may avoid this toxicity.
It is noteworthy that our studies show AZT but not ddI to
be a potent inhibitor of PBMC mitogenesis. Similar findings
have been reported for bone marrow cell cultures (38); whereas
low concentrations of AZT (i.e., 1.0 MM) have inhibited my￾elopoiesis or erythropoiesis, ddI has been shown to have little
effect on the growth of bone marrow progenitor cells (38-40).
Mitsuya and Broder (4) reported that similar concentrations of
ddI had no effect on the viability ofan established T helper cell
line. The major adverse effects noted in patients treated with
ddI have been dose-dependent peripheral neuropathy, and in
some patients, pancreatitis (9, 41). Early results from clinical
studies show that p24 antigenemia has decreased and numbers
of CD4 lymphocytes have increased in patients receiving ddI
(9, 41). Possibly, ddI may prove safe and beneficial as an anti￾retroviral drug by avoiding lymphocyte toxicity. Further clini￾cal study will determine the efficacy for ddI in HIV disease.
Further in vitro studies of antiviral agents before their clinical
use should allow us to make predictions about the conse￾quences of these agents upon the host immune system.
