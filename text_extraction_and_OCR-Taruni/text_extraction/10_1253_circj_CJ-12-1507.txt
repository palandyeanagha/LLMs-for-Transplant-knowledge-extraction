associated with an increased risk of hematoma and other bleed￾ing complications.12
Previous studies have confirmed these problems associated 
with bridging therapy. Michaud et al reported that patients re￾ceiving heparin after cardiac device implantation had a 5- or 
10-fold greater risk of hematoma formation compared with 
those treated with warfarin alone or no anticoagulation, re￾spectively.13 Recently, Tompkins et al and Ahmed et al showed 
that periprocedural heparin significantly increased the risk of 
bleeding complications at the time of pacemaker or ICD im￾plantation.14,15 These analyses, however, were performed in 
patients from Western countries including the USA, clearly 
different from Japanese patients. Therefore, the influence of 
antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy on the risk of bleeding 
complications remains to be assessed in unselected Japanese 
patients.
The aim of the present study was to clarify the incidence of 
bleeding and thromboembolic complications and to assess the 
influence of heparin bridging on these complications at the 
revention of sudden cardiac death in patients at risk of 
lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias by implantable car￾dioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been established.1–3
In contrast, there are serious problems with ICD including peri￾operative complications, inappropriate discharge, infection and 
lead failure.4–8
Bleeding complications are a major concern in patients 
undergoing surgical interventions who are receiving anti￾thrombotic agents. According to the guidelines of the Japanese 
Circulation Society (2009) and the American College of Chest 
Physicians (2008), substitution of warfarin, an oral anticoagu￾lant agent, with heparin (ie, heparin bridging) has been recom￾mended in such patients at high risk of thromboembolic 
events.9,10 Heparin, however, in combination with anti-throm￾bin III, is known to exert not only anticoagulant but also anti￾platelet actions via anti-thrombin effect.11 The antiplatelet ac￾tion of heparin may attenuate primary hemostasis due to platelet 
aggregation, which is essential for secondary hemostasis, there￾by facilitating rebleeding. Therefore, heparin bridging may be

Background: According to the current guidelines, substitution of warfarin with heparin is recommended as periop￾erative management in patients with high risk of thromboembolism. Optimal management of oral anticoagulation in 
patients undergoing implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation, however, remains controversial.
Methods and Results: Bleeding complications among 273 consecutive patients undergoing initial ICD implantation 
were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were grouped according to medication at the time of device implantation: 
neither antiplatelet nor anticoagulation (N group, n=121); antiplatelet only (AP group, n=59); warfarin (W group, 
n=59); and heparin bridging (H group, n=34). The rate of the major bleeding complications, defined as hematoma 
requiring reoperation, cardiac tamponade, and pericardial effusion requiring additional hospital stay, was 1.7% in 
the N group, 0% in the AP group, 5.1% in the W group, and 17.6% in the H group (P<0.001, N group vs. H group). 
After multivariate adjustment, heparin bridging was a significant predictor of major bleeding complications (odds ratio, 
7.44; 95% confidence interval: 2.06–26.89; P=0.0022). The international normalized ratio of 3 patients in the W group 
with major bleeding complications was 1.98±0.10, and was significantly higher than in patients without them 
(1.31±0.05, n=26, P<0.001).
Conclusions: Heparin bridging increased the risk of bleeding complications at the time of ICD implantation.

(ie, 0–4 days), and it was determined at the discretion of the 
implanting physician. The study was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of Hokkaido University Hospital.
Outcome
The status of all patients was available at least 1 month after 
ICD implantation. No patients died during the hospital stay for 
the ICD operation. The primary outcome for this study was 
major bleeding or thromboembolic events that occurred dur￾ing or within 1 month of the implantation. Major bleeding in￾cluded hematoma requiring reoperation, cardiac tamponade, 
pericardial effusion requiring additional hospital stay, or criti￾cal symptomatic bleeding such as intracranial hemorrhage. 
The major thromboembolic events were stroke and systemic 
embolism including acute vascular occlusion of an extremity 
or organs.
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as mean±SE. Simple between-group 
analysis were conducted using Student’s t-test. Intergroup com￾parisons for continuous variables were performed with the ad￾justed t-test within ANOVA (Bonferroni method). Categorical 
variables were compared using chi-square test. Logistic re￾gression analysis were performed to estimate the predictors of 
major bleeding complications. Differences with P<0.05 were 
considered significant. Statview version 5.0 for Windows (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analysis.
Results
Patient Characteristics
The present study included 273 patients with a mean age of 
58±1 years, and 78% were men (Table 1). The etiology of 
structural heart disease was ischemic in 28% and non-ischemic 
in 54%. No structural heart disease were identified in 18% of 
patients, including primary electrical disease or coronary spas￾time of ICD implantation in Japanese patients.
Methods
Subjects
We performed a retrospective review of bleeding and throm￾boembolic complications in 273 consecutive patients who un￾derwent initial ICD implantation at Hokkaido University Hos￾pital from March 1990 to September 2010. For each patient, 
baseline data included (1) demography; (2) underlying heart 
disease; (3) clinical status; (4) indication for ICD; (5) type of 
ICD; (6) bleeding and thromboembolic complications during 
the perioperative period; (7) echocardiographic findings; and 
(8) anti-thrombotic treatment.
In order to clarify the effect of anti-thrombotic agents on the 
incidence of bleeding and thromboembolic complications, 
patients were classified into 4 groups according to medication 
at the time of device implantation: no antiplatelet or antico￾agulation (N group); antiplatelet only (AP group); warfarin (W 
group); and heparin bridging (H group; Table 1).
In patients with heparin bridging (H group), warfarin was 
discontinued 3–5 days prior to implantation, and i.v. heparin 
(500–1,000unit/h) was started 12h after withholding warfarin. 
The dose of heparin was adjusted for activated partial throm￾boplastin time to reach around 60s. I.v. heparin was withheld 
4–6h prior to the procedure, and was restarted usually 12h after 
implantation. Patients in W group discontinued warfarin typi￾cally 1–2 days prior to the procedure, and restarted the day of 
or the next day after the implantation. When warfarin treat￾ment or heparin bridging was performed, the patient was cat￾egorized as W group or H group even if antiplatelet drugs were 
ongoing. Based on the prolonged efficacy of antiplatelet drugs, 
their use within 5 days of the operation was considered as on￾drug antiplatelet treatment.14,16 Therefore, in the AP group, the 
discontinuation period of aspirin and thienopyridine (either 
clopidogrel or ticlopidine) before the procedure was variable

Heparin Bridging and ICD Implantation 2005
The proportion of these indications did not differ between pa￾tients with or without major bleeding complications (Table 2).
Some patients had been treated with both anticoagulation and 
antiplatelet drugs. Among 273 patients, perioperative treatment 
with heparin bridging, warfarin, aspirin, and thienopyridine 
(either clopidogrel or ticlopidine) was performed in 34 (12%), 
59 (22%), 96 (35%) and 22 (8%), respectively (Table 3). 
Significant association with major bleeding complications was 
observed only in patients having heparin bridging treatment 
(Table 3).
Among 59 patients receiving warfarin (without heparin bridg￾ing) (W group), major bleeding occurred in 3 patients (5.1%): 
1 hematoma, 1 cardiac tamponade, and 1 pericardial effusion. 
The international normalized ratio (INR) on the day of or 1 
day after ICD implantation was available in 29 patients (49% 
of W group) including all 3 patients with major bleeding com￾plications. The INR of these 3 patients was 2.11, 2.05, and 
tic angina. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
was 44±1%. Indication for ICD was primary prevention in 
23% and secondary prevention in 77%.
Patients with any anti-thrombotic treatment (AP, W, and H 
groups) were significantly older and had lower LVEF. They 
had higher prevalence of structural heart disease, more severe 
heart failure symptoms (ie, high New York Heart Association 
[NYHA] class), and were more likely to have biventricular 
ICD than those without any anti-thrombotic treatment (N group; 
Table 1).
Outcome
The rate of major bleeding complications was 4.0% (Figure 1). 
These consisted of hematoma requiring surgical evacuation in 
6 patients (2.2%), cardiac tamponade in 3 patients (1.1%), and 
pericardial effusion in 2 patients (0.7%). The rate of bleeding 
complications was significantly higher in the H group than in 
the N group. In the H group, the bleeding complications in￾cluded 5 cases of hematoma and one of cardiac tamponade 
(17.6%).
There were 2 thromboembolic complications (0.7%): 1 stroke 
in the N group, and 1 acute arterial occlusion of a lower ex￾tremity in the H group. These event rates did not differ be￾tween groups (Figure 1).
Ninety-three (34.1%) of 273 patients had been treated with 
oral anticoagulation (ie, warfarin), and they were classified into 
either the W group (n=59) or H group (n=34). The indications 
of oral anticoagulation included atrial fibrillation (AF)17,18 in 
67 patients, left ventricular thrombus or dysfunction in 17 pa￾tients, and mechanical prosthetic valve in 6 patients (Table 2).

The optimal INR ranged from 2.0 to 3.0, and INR <2.0 
steeply increased the risk of stroke in patients with AF.19 In 
contrast, low-intensity warfarin (INR 1.5–2.1) was safe and 
effective for secondary prevention of stroke in Japanese pa￾tients with non-valvular AF, especially in older patients.20,21 In 
combination with the present data, low-intensity warfarin 
during the perioperative period would be sufficient to reduce 
the likelihood of major hemorrhagic or ischemic events in 
Japanese patients.
Heparin bridging was originally recommended as peripro￾cedural treatment especially in patients with acute or recurrent 
venous thromboembolism.22 The annual recurrence rate of these 
events is very high, reaching 15–40%, without adequate anti￾coagulation.22 In addition, surgery can induce hemostatic chang￾es that may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism.23
Therefore, i.v. heparin therapy was proposed as perioperative 
anticoagulation in patients with high risk of venous thrombo￾embolism, even though 2 days of such management was esti￾mated to increase the absolute rate of major postoperative 
bleeding by approximately 3%.22
In contrast, there is no clear evidence that surgery increases 
the risk of arterial embolism in patients with AF or mechanical 
heart valves. Moreover, the incidence of pulmonary thrombo￾embolism and deep vein thrombosis (ie, major venous embo￾lisms) in Japan was estimated to be one-eighth and one-fourth, 
respectively, that in the USA and Europe.24,25 A different peri￾procedural strategy might be necessary, because the indication 
for anticoagulation in most of the patients undergoing ICD 
implantation in the present study was the presence of AF and 
left ventricular thrombus or dysfunction (Table 2).
1.79, which was significantly higher than in those without com￾plications (P<0.0001; Figure 2).
Predictors of Major Bleeding Complications
In order to estimate the predictors of major bleeding complica￾tions, logistic regression analysis was performed. Heparin bridg￾ing or symptomatic heart failure (NYHA class ≥II) was sig￾nificantly associated with major bleeding complications on 
univariate analysis (Table 4). The use of warfarin or antiplate￾let drugs and the indication and type of ICD were not related 
to these adverse events. In addition, multivariate analysis dem￾onstrated that heparin bridging was the single independent pre￾dictor of bleeding complications (Table 5).
Discussion
The present study has shown that heparin bridging was associ￾ated with a 7-fold increase in perioperative major bleeding 
complications in Japanese patients undergoing ICD implanta￾tion. In contrast, low-intensity anticoagulation by warfarin in￾creased the risk of neither major bleeding nor thromboembolic 
events. Use of warfarin with INR around 1.3–1.7 might be safe 
as an alternative method of heparin bridging at ICD implanta￾tion, given that the INR of 3 patients with bleeding complica￾tions was 2.11, 2.05 and 1.79 (1.98±0.10), which was higher 
than in those without complications (1.31±0.05).

have been included in the AP group. A recent study reported 
that clopidogrel significantly increased the risk of pocket he￾matoma at the time of pacemaker or ICD implantation, and 
that its discontinuation >4 days before device implantation 
prevented development of hematoma.16 The present study, how￾ever, highlights the perioperative management of anticoagula￾tion, which seems to have more impact on major bleeding 
complications compared to antiplatelet therapy in patients un￾dergoing ICD implantation (Table 3).
Conclusion
Heparin bridging increased the risk of bleeding complications 
in patients undergoing initial ICD implantation.

Short-term (≤5 days) interruption of warfarin therapy with￾out heparin bridging was associated with a low risk (0.7%) of 
post-procedure thromboembolism within 30 days.26 In addi￾tion, the ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines state that, in patients with 
AF but no mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is reasonable 
to interrupt anticoagulation for up to 1 week without substitut￾ing heparin, for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a 
risk of bleeding.27 Therefore, we propose the simple protocol 
of 1 or 2 days interruption of warfarin before device implanta￾tion and its resumption on the day of operation in patients with 
INR in the effective therapeutic range (2.0–3.0), thereby pre￾sumably reaching INR of around 1.3–1.7 during the periop￾erative period.
Several studies have reported that perioperative use of hep￾arin at implantation of pacemaker or ICD was associated with 
pocket hematoma formation in 5.7–23% of patients.13–16,28–32
In contrast to the high rate of pocket hematoma in heparin 
bridging, continuation of warfarin (without heparin bridging) 
with therapeutic INR appeared to be safe and cost-effective as 
perioperative management in patients receiving oral antico￾agulation therapy in some retrospective analyses.14–16,32–35 The 
present study, which is the first report in Japanese patients, is 
in agreement with those studies,14–16,32–35 and emphasizes the 
increased risk of bleeding complications with heparin bridging 
after ICD implantation.
Two prospective randomized trials assessed the manage￾ment strategy of oral anticoagulation in patients undergoing 
pacemaker or ICD implantation.31,36 In contrast to the retro￾spective studies,14–16,32–35 a prospective study showed that de￾velopment of pocket hematoma after implanting/replacing a 
pacemaker or ICD was observed in 7.8% of patients treated 
with heparin bridging, and in 8.0% of those with oral antico￾agulation who maintained an INR of 2±0.3.31 In another pro￾spective study, there was a trend toward reduced complica￾tions in patients with warfarin continuation,36 but the results 
were not statistically significant, possibly due to the small 
number of patients (n=7) randomized to heparin bridging. A 
large randomized controlled trial to compare the 2 strategies 
(heparin bridging vs. continuation of oral anticoagulation), in 
patients undergoing pacemaker or ICD implantation is now 
under way in North America.37
In the present study, discontinuation of warfarin was made 
typically 1–2 days prior to operation, thereby maintaining some 
anticoagulant effects (INR 1.4±0.3, n=29; which was lower 
than that in the prospective randomized trial by Tolosana et 
al:31 INR, 2.0±0.3, n=50). In the Tolosana et al study, the rate 
of bleeding complication was not different between the 2 peri￾operative strategies, maintenance of oral anticoagulation and 
heparin bridging. The lower incidence of bleeding complica￾tions without increase of thromboembolic events in the pres￾ent W group compared to the H group (Figure 1) may have 
resulted from short-term interruption of warfarin.
There are several limitations to be considered in this study. 
First, hematomas without surgical evacuation were not includ￾ed as bleeding complications. We thus could not evaluate the 
precise number of all pocket hematomas that might be consid￾ered as bleeding complications. Second, perioperative man￾agement of anticoagulation was dependent on the decision by 
each doctor. Moreover, as was evident in Figure 2, INR on or 
1 day after ICD implantation in the W group was variable and 
less than optimal (ie, 2.0–3.0) in most patients. This is because 
there were no predetermined protocols of continuation of war￾farin (without heparin bridging). Third, due to the definition 
of ongoing antiplatelet treatment (within 5 days of operation), 
heterogeneous patients in terms of antiplatelet potency may
