Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is known to affect the innate immune response, for
example, by regulating the differentiation and function of immune cells. However, whether
IRF8 can influence cardiac hypertrophy is unknown. Here we show that IRF8 levels are
decreased in human dilated/hypertrophic cardiomyopathic hearts and in murine hypertrophic
hearts. Mice overexpressing Irf8 specifically in the heart are resistant to aortic banding (AB)-
induced cardiac hypertrophy, whereas mice lacking IRF8 either globally or specifically in
cardiomyocytes develop an aggravated phenotype induced by pressure overload. Mechan￾istically, we show that IRF8 directly interacts with NFATc1 to prevent NFATc1 translocation and
thus inhibits the hypertrophic response. Inhibition of NFATc1 ameliorates the cardiac
abnormalities in IRF8  /  mice after AB. In contrast, constitutive activation of NFATc1 nul￾lifies the protective effects of IRF8 on cardiac hypertrophy in IRF8-overexpressing mice. Our
results indicate that IRF8 is a potential therapeutic target in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

Heart failure is among the most prevalent causes of
mortality globally. A major risk factor for heart failure
development is cardiac hypertrophy, which has various
causes, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, valvular
heart disease and endocrine disorders1,2. Despite extensive
studies, the mechanisms controlling the progression from
adaptive hypertrophy to heart failure remain poorly
understood. Cardiac hypertrophy results from a complex
signalling cascade involving the MAPK, PI3K/Akt, PKC, NFkB,
cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and
calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)
pathways3–6. Multiple signalling cascades converge upon certain
transcription factors, activating nuclear cardiac fetal gene
programs and ultimately leading to pathological cardiac
hypertrophy4,7. Therefore, molecules that selectively affect the
activity of specific transcription factors could be of great
therapeutic interest for treating cardiac hypertrophy.
Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), also known as interferon
consensus sequence-binding protein, is a member of the IRF
family of transcription factors that are induced by interferon in a
variety of cell types8
. IRF8 itself is induced by interferon in
macrophages and T cells, with its induction mediated by a gamma
activation sequence element in the IRF8 promoter9–11. IRF8 exerts
its activity through the formation of different DNA-binding
heterocomplexes with multiple partners, including members of
the IRF family (IRF1, IRF2 and IRF4) and non-IRF transcription
factors (PU.1, TEL, E47 and MIZ1)12,13. Once expressed, IRF8
either activates or represses the transcription of downstream target
genes, which are dependent upon their interacting partners14,15.
A large number of studies have demonstrated that IRF8 functions
as a transcription factor in the regulation of the innate
immune response and plays critical roles in the differentiation of
myeloid cells15,16, while IRF8 also could function as a regulator
factor to regulate innate and adaptive immune responses and other
biological processes17–19. In addition, IRF8 has been implicated as a
tumour suppressor gene in certain hematopoietic cancers and solid
tumour20,21. Interestingly, an increasing number of studies have
supported the involvement of tumour suppressors in negatively
modulating cardiac hypertrophy22,23, raising the possibility that
IRF8 might regulate cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of IRF8
in cardiac hypertrophy has not yet been studied and remains
uncharacterized. Therefore, the aims of the current study were
as follows: first, to determine whether IRF8 is altered in human
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) hearts, in human hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) hearts and in an animal model of cardiac
hypertrophy induced by pressure overload; second, to determine
whether IRF8 might affect cardiac hypertrophy; finally, if so, to
determine the responsible mechanisms involved.
Here we show that IRF8 is downregulated in both mouse hearts
and cardiomyocytes after hypertrophic stress treatment. Moreover,
IRF8-deficient mice reveal an aggravated pressure overload-induced
hypertrophic response, whereas the opposite effects occur in IRF8-
overexpressing mice. We also report that the IAD1 domain of IRF8
(N/200–377aa) could interact with the TAD-A domain (N/1-205aa)
of NFATc1 to inhibit the nuclear translocation of NFATc1.
Furthermore, inhibition of NFATc1 with a cell-permeable NFAT
inhibitory peptide (VIVIT) counter acts the effects of IRF8
deficiency, whereas constitutively active NFATc1 (CaNFATc1)
negates the anti-hypertrophic effects of IRF8. Taken together, our
results indicate that IRF8 is a novel negative regulator of pathological
cardiac hypertrophy, largely via its interaction with NFATc1.
Results
IRF8 expression is decreased in hypertrophic hearts. To explore
the potential role of IRF8 in the development of cardiac
hypertrophy and heart failure, we first examined whether the
IRF8 expression levels were altered in pathological hearts.
Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
revealed that the IRF8 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein
expression levels were significantly decreased in DCM human
hearts, compared with donor hearts (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary
Fig. 1a). IRF8 reduction was accompanied by an upregulation in
the expression of cardiac hypertrophic markers, that is, atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP), b-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC)
(Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Fig. 1b), which was consistent with
the results of HCM hearts (Fig. 1c,d). In an experimental mouse
model of aortic banding (AB)-induced cardiac hypertrophy (as
evidenced by elevated levels of b-MHC and ANP, Fig. 1e,f), IRF8
levels were progressively downregulated by B38% in mouse
hearts at week 2 after AB, by B46% at week 4 after AB and by
B57% at week 8 after AB, compared with sham-operated hearts
(Fig 1e,f, n ¼ 3 independent experiments, Po0.05 versus Sham;
statistical analysis by Student’s two-tailed t-test). The immuno￾fluorescence results showed that IRF8 was expressed in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus of cardiomyocytes and that its expression
was downregulated in hypertrophic hearts (Supplementary
Fig. 1c). Furthermore, using in vitro cultured neonatal rat
cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) treated with either angiotensin II (Ang
II, 1 mM) or phenylephrine (PE, 100 mM) for 48 h to induce
hypertrophy, we found that IRF8 expression was also reduced by
B55% (Ang II) and B68% (PE) in these hypertrophic cardio￾myocytes (Fig. 1g,h, n ¼ 3 independent experiments, Po0.01
versus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); statistical analysis by
Student’s two-tailed t-test).Thus, IRF8 is significantly decreased in
DCM/HCM human hearts and in pressure overload-induced
hypertrophic murine hearts as well as in in vitro Ang II/PE￾treated cardiomyocytes.
IRF8 suppresses Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
Decreased IRF8 expression in response to hypertrophic stimuli
implies a potential role for IRF8 in the regulation of pathological
cardiac hypertrophy. To test this hypothesis, we performed gain￾and loss-of-function studies in NRCMs. NRCMs were infected
with either AdshIRF8 to knockdown IRF8 or AdIRF8 to over￾express IRF8 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The cells were then
stimulated with Ang II (1 mM) or PBS control for 48 h and were
immunostained with a-actinin for cellular size measurement. The
IRF8 deficiency mediated by AdshIRF8 infection remarkably
increased Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, whereas
IRF8 overexpression by AdIRF8 significantly inhibited cell
hypertrophy (as evidenced by cardiomyocyte cell surface area,
Fig. 2a,b). The levels of hypertrophic markers (ANP and b-MHC)
were increased during IRF8 knockdown, and decreased during
IRF8 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data implicate IRF8 as a
negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy.
IRF8 deletion aggravates AB-induced hypertrophy. To evaluate
the anti-hypertrophic effects of IRF8 in vivo, we first utilized a
mouse model with a global knockout of IRF8 (IRF8  /  ), in
which IRF8 cardiac expression was absent (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). Notably, at baseline, IRF8  /  mice manifested no
pathological alterations in cardiac structure or function
(Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, to clarify the effects of
aging on the cardiac function of IRF8  / mice, we also assessed
the phenotypes of cardiac function and structure in 47-week-old
IRF8  /  and wild-type (IRF8 þ / þ ) mice. The results showed no
significant differences in heart weight (HW)/body weight (BW),
HW/tibia length (TL) and lung weight (LW)/BW, cross sectional
area, collagen volume or echocardiography (LV end-diastolic
dimension (LVEDD), LV end-systolic dimension (LVESD),

fraction shortening (FS%)) between IRF8  /  and IRF8 þ / þ
mice (Supplementary Fig. 3b–f). However, 2 weeks after AB,
IRF8  /  mice exhibited a remarkable deterioration in cardiac
hypertrophy compared with IRF8 þ / þ mice, as indicated by
increased ratios of HW/BW, LW/BW and HW/TL (Fig. 3a–c).
Histological examination revealed increased cross sectional area
of cardiomyocytes in IRF8  /  mice compared with IRF8 þ / þ
mice after a 2-week course of AB (Fig. 3d,e). Accordingly, the
mRNA levels of several hypertrophic markers, including ANP,
BNP and b-MHC, were much higher in IRF8  /  mice than in
IRF8 þ / þ mice 2 weeks after AB (Supplementary Fig. 3h).
Additionally, echocardiographic and hemodynamic measure￾ments demonstrated that IRF8 deficiency significantly exacer￾bated AB-induced cardiac dilation and dysfunction compared
with control IRF8 þ / þ mice (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 2).
Accordingly, the cumulative survival rate was decreased in IRF8
knockout mice 2 weeks after AB surgery compared with controls
(Supplementary Fig. 3g).
We next assessed AB-induced cardiac fibrosis, a classical
feature of the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
Paraffin-embedded slides were stained with picrosirius red
(PSR) to determine the extent of fibrosis. Both interstitial and
perivascular fibrosis were markedly increased in AB-treated
IRF8 þ / þ hearts but to a more prominent extent in IRF8  / 
hearts 2 weeks after AB (Fig. 3g). Cardiac fibrosis was further
quantified by measuring the left ventricular (LV) collagen volume
and the expression of the fibrotic markers Collagen I, Collagen III
and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and revealed that the
AB-induced fibrotic response was significantly activated in
IRF8  /  mice compared with IRF8 þ / þ mice (Fig. 3h and
Supplementary Fig. 3i). Collectively, these loss-of-function data
indicate that IRF8 deficiency aggravates the pathological cardiac
remodelling induced by chronic AB.
To define specifically the effects of IRF8 on the heart, we
generated a mouse model with a cardiac-specific deletion of
IRF8 by crossing IRF8-Flox mice (B6(Cg)-Irf8tm1.1Hm/J, Jackson
Laboratory, 014175) with mice carrying the a-myosin
heavy chain (a-MHC)–MerCreMer transgene (MEM-Cre-Tg
(Myh6-cre/Esr1), Jackson Laboratory, 005650), as shown in
Supplementary Fig. 4a–c. Cardiac-specific IRF8 knockout resulted

in deteriorated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in response to
pressure overload, as evidenced by higher ratios of HW/BW,
HW/TL and LW/BW; larger cross sectional areas of cardiomyo￾cytes; and higher expression levels of fetal genes and fibrotic
markers than those of the controls (Supplementary Fig. 4d–k).
Echocardiographic results also showed remarkable cardiac
dilation and dysfunction in IRF8-KO mice compared with
control mice (Supplementary Fig. 4l). These data provide further
evidence that the cardiac-specific deletion of IRF8 promotes
cardiac hypertrophy upon pressure overload.
IRF8 transgenic mice exhibit attenuated cardiac hypertrophy.
Next, we sought to evaluate whether elevated IRF8 levels in the
heart would attenuate cardiac hypertrophy. To address this
hypothesis, transgenic (TG) mice with cardiac-specific over￾expression of IRF8 were generated using the a-MHC promoter
(Supplementary Fig. 5a). Four germ lines of IRF8-TG mice were
verified by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Under
basal conditions, all the IRF8-TG mice were healthy and showed
no apparent cardiac morphological or pathological abnormalities
(Supplementary Table 1). We then selected transgenic line 10,
which expressed the highest levels of IRF8, for further experi￾ments. IRF8-TG mice and their WT littermates (referred to as
‘NTG’) were subjected to AB surgery or a sham operation and
examined after 8 weeks. As expected, AB-induced cardiac
hypertrophy was significantly attenuated in IRF8-TG mice, as
evidenced by lower ratios of HW/BW, HW/TL and LW/BW than
those in the NTG mice (Fig. 4a–c). Similarly, the cross sectional
area of cardiomyocytes was reduced by B28% in AB-operated
TG mice compared with NTGs (Fig. 4d,e, Po0.05; statistical
analysis was carried out by two-way analysis of variance with
general linear model procedures using a univariate approach;
n ¼ 8 mice per experimental group). IRF8 overexpression sig￾nificantly inhibited AB-triggered cardiac dilation and dysfunction
as determined by echocardiographic and hemodynamic mea￾surements (Fig. 4f–h and Supplementary Table 3). IRF8-TG
mouse tissue consistently exhibited decreased PSR staining
positivity in the interstitial and perivascular spaces, as well as
decreased collagen volumes following chronic AB compared with
NTGs (Fig. 4i,j). To clarify whether different IRF8 protein
expression levels had the similar effects on cardiac hypertrophy,
the transgenic line 5, which expressed medium IRF8 protein
levels, was subjected to AB surgery. The results showed that
transgenic line 5 and transgenic line 10 had similar phenotypes,
as evidenced by comparable HW/BW, LW/BW and HW/TL
ratios; cross sectional areas, LV collagen volumes; and cardiac

Together, these gain-of-function data indicate that IRF8 over￾expression attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in
response to chronic pressure overload.
IRF8 directly interacts with and inhibits NFATc1. Increasing
evidence has suggested that numerous transcription factors
or regulator factors are involved in the development of
cardiac hypertrophy4,7. Therefore, we next sought to determine
whether IRF8 would interfere with these hypertrophy-related
transcription factors in hearts in response to pressure overload.
To this end, we performed dual-luciferase reporter analysis
using a Cignal 45-Pathway Reporter Array (SABiosciences, Cat
number: CCA-901L), which provides comprehensive screening
for measuring the activities of diverse transcription factors.

Our initial results showed that NFATc1 transcriptional activity
was dramatically inhibited by IRF8 in cardiomyocytes
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). To validate this result further, NRCMs
were co-infected with AdNFATc1-Luc and either AdIRF8 or
AdshIRF8. These experiments clearly showed that NFATc1
activity was significantly limited by the overexpression of IRF8
but was increased significantly after IRF8 knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. 6b). We also performed the luciferase
reporter analysis in the hearts of IRF8-TG or -KO mice
containing the NFAT-luciferase reporter gene and obtained
similar results (Fig. 5a,b).
It is well recognized that the dephosphorylation and sub￾sequent nuclear translocation of NFATc1 are important for
NFAT-mediated transcriptional activation24. We therefore
determined whether IRF8 affects the dephosphorylation and
translocation of NFATc1. Nuclear NFATc1 levels in IRF8-TG
and IRF8 knockout animals subjected to AB were determined
by western blot (Fig. 5c,d). Compared with their respective
controls, AB-induced nuclear translocation of NFATc1 was
significantly blocked by IRF8 overexpression but was
markedly increased by IRF8 deficiency (Fig. 5c,d). In support
of these results, the AB-triggered reduction of phosphorylated
and total NFATc1 in the cytoplasm was significantly lower in
NTG hearts compared with IRF8-TG hearts (Fig. 5c). In contrast,
the levels of phosphorylated and total NFATc1 in the cytoplasm
were more reduced in AB-treated IRF8  /  hearts than in
control samples (IRF8 þ / þ ) (Fig. 5d). Similar findings were
also observed in AdIRF8- and AdshIRF8-infected NRCMs upon
treatment with 1 mM of Ang II (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d).
Furthermore, we confirmed these results by immunofluorescence
analysis of H9C2 cells transfected with IRF8 or shIRF8 and
of NRCMs infected with AdIRF8 or AdshIRF8 (Fig. 5e,f and
Supplementary Fig. 6e). However, the nuclear NFATc2
and NFATc3 levels were increased in the IRF8 þ / þ mice after
the AB operation but there was no significant difference between
the IRF8 knockout and IRF8 þ / þ mice after AB surgery
(Supplementary Fig. 6f). Based on these results, IRF8 negatively
regulates the AB-induced dephosphorylation and subsequent
nuclear translocation of NFATc1.
The regulation of NFATc1 activity by IRF8 prompted us to
ask whether IRF8 could directly interact with NFATc1. To
answer this question, we transfected Flag-tagged NFATc1 and
HA-tagged IRF8 into HEK293T cells and then performed co￾immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments. The results showed that
IRF8 precipitated with NFATc1 and vice versa (Fig. 5g). To
confirm this interaction further, we performed a glutathione S￾transferase (GST)-pull-down assay with GST-tagged IRF8. As
expected, NFATc1 was eluted along with IRF8 (Fig. 5h). Then,
we performed co-IP for endogenous protein interactions after
extracting the proteins of NRCMs. Similar results were observed
in NRCMs under basal conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6g).
To exclude the possibility that IRF8/NFATc1 binding was
artificially created during the process of IP and pull-down,
we sought to identify their sub-cellular localization in H9C2 cells
by immunofluorescent staining and observed that IRF8 and
NFATc1 co-localized within cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 6h).
Together, these results indicate that IRF8 physically interacts
with NFATc1.
Next, we sought to determine the region within IRF8
responsible for its binding to NFATc1 utilizing various deletion
mutants of IRF8. Deletions of the amino-terminal 200 amino
acids (N/1-200) and carboxy-terminal 47 amino acids (AID/377-
424) did not affect the interaction of IRF8 with NFATc1. In
contrast, this interaction was abolished by the deletion of amino
acid 200 to 377 (N/1-200 and DIAD1/D200-377) (left panels of
Fig. 5i,j), indicating that the IRF-associated domain (IAD1:200-
377aa) is a bona fide region of IRF8 that binds to NFATc1.
Similarly, we generated a series of NFATc1 deletion mutants and
mapped their ability to interact with IRF8. We found that two
regions from amino acid 205 to the carboxyl terminus (C1/206-
931 and C2/579-931) were not required for this interaction,
whereas the TAD-A containing amino-terminal (N1/1-205,
N2/1-426 and N3/1-690) was capable of binding to IRF8 (right
panels of Fig. 5i,j). Collectively, these results demonstrate an
authentic interaction between IRF8 and NFATc1 that might
underpin the negative regulation of NFATc1 by IRF8.
To determine further whether such an interaction affected
NFATc1 activity, we examined the effects of IRF8 on the
luciferase activity of the established NFATc1-dependent
genes including BNP, MCIP1.4 and EDN-1 (all of which are
involved in cardiac hypertrophy) in AdshRNA/AdshIRF8 and
AdGFP/AdIRF8-infected primary cultured cardiomyocytes.
We found that IRF8 markedly inhibited BNP, MCIP1.4 and
EDN-1 promoter activities, indicating that IRF8 recruited
NFATc1 and then negatively regulated NFATc1-dependent
transcriptional activity and blocked cardiac hypertrophy
(Supplementary Fig. 6i,j). Furthermore, we generated a plasmid
pcDNA3-IRF8DIAD1, in which the binding region (200–377 aa)
was deleted, and encompassed by replication-defective adenoviral
vectors. Then, NRCMs were co-infected with AdIRF8DIAD1 and
the NFATc1-luciferase reporter. IRF8-mediated inhibition of
NFATc1 was abolished by the deletion of IAD1 (200–377 aa)
(Supplementary Fig. 6k). We also overexpressed IRF8DIAD1 in
NRCMs, followed by the addition of Ang II to induce cell
hypertrophy and we observed that Ang II-induced cell hyper￾trophy was dramatically suppressed by the overexpression of full￾length IRF8 (Supplementary Fig. 6l). However, such inhibitory
effects were completely lost in AdIRF8DIAD1-infected myocytes
(Supplementary Fig. 6l). Together, these data suggest that the
IAD1 region is essential for the IRF8-elicited inhibition of
NFATc1 and, consequently, cell hypertrophy.
IRF8-mediated pathological hypertrophy requires NFATc1. To
determine whether NFATc1 signalling plays a causative role in
the IRF8-mediated inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy, VIVIT (an
inhibitor of NFAT) was infused into IRF8 þ / þ and IRF8  / 
mice for 2 weeks via an Alzet 1002 osmotic minipump. Infused
saline of a similar volume served as the control. These mice
subsequently underwent treatment with AB for 2 weeks.
Pre-treatment with VIVIT dramatically attenuated AB-induced
cardiac remodelling in IRF8 þ / þ mice (Fig. 6a–f and
Supplementary Table 4), consistent with previous reports25.
Significantly, VIVIT treatment limited the aggravated effects of a
IRF8-null mutation on cardiac remodelling in response to 2
weeks of AB, as evidenced by the following: lower ratios of HW/
BW, LW/BW and HW/TL (Fig. 6d–f); smaller cross sectional
areas of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 6a,b); and smaller collagen volumes
(Fig. 6a,c) than those of saline-treated IRF8  /  mice. Pre￾treatment with VIVIT significantly abolished AB-induced
increases in mRNA levels of hypertrophic and fibrotic markers,
including ANP, BNP, b-MHC, CTGF, Collagen I and Collagen
III, in IRF8  /  mice compared with saline-treated animals
(Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). These findings suggest that pre￾inhibition of NFAT signalling protects against pressure overload￾induced cardiac abnormalities in IRF8  /  mice.
The above findings suggested that cardiac NFATc1 signalling
activation neutralizes the protective effects of IRF8 on cardiac
hypertrophy. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice with a
floxed CaNFATc1 were mated with transgenic aMHC-MerCre￾Mer (MEM) mice to generate conditional CaNFATc1 transgenic
mice (CaNFATc1-TG) (Supplementary Fig. 8a). These inducible

CaNFATc1-TG mice were crossed with IRF8-TG mice to yield
IRF8/CaNFATc1 double transgenic (DTG) mice (Supplementary
Fig. 8b). Transgenic founders were identified by western blot
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Mice (CaNFATc1-TGs and
DTGs) at 6 weeks of age were subjected to tamoxifen (80
mg kg  1 per day, intraperitoneal injection) for 5 consecutive
days to induce Cre-dependent recombination. We found that
constitutive activation of NFATc1 promoted more AB-induced
cardiac remodelling compared with MEM-Cre controls (Fig. 7a–f
and Supplementary Table 5). Remarkably, IRF8-mediated
inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy was blocked by NFATc1
re-activation, which was evidenced by higher ratios of HW/BW,
HW/TL and LW/BW in AB-treated DTG mice relative to AB￾operated IRF8-TG mice (Fig. 7d–f). In addition, 4 weeks after AB,
DTG hearts displayed larger cross sectional areas of cardiomyo￾cytes and volumes of cardiac fibrosis than did IRF8-TG hearts
(Fig. 7a–c). Markers of cardiac hypertrophy (ANP, BNP and
b-MHC) and fibrosis (CTGF, Collagen I and Collagen III) were
dramatically upregulated in DTG mice compared with IRF8-TG
mice after 4 weeks after AB surgery (Supplementary Fig. 8d,e).
Collectively, these results indicate that targeted NFATc1 activa￾tion negates the protective effects of IRF8 on cardiac hypertrophy
in response to pressure overload. Thus, our findings suggest that
IRF8 negatively modulates pathological cardiac remodelling, at
least in part by inhibiting NFATc1 signalling.
Discussion
IRF8 plays an important role in various organs, including the
heart. However, its functional role in the development of cardiac
hypertrophy and failure has remained unclear. In the present
study, we utilized both gain-of-function and loss-of-function
approaches to decipher thoroughly the role of IRF8 in chronic
pressure overload-induced cardiac remodelling. Our findings
demonstrate that an elevation in IRF8 is instrumental for hearts
to resist pressure overload-induced hypertrophy and dysfunction
and that conversely, the loss of IRF8 leads to exaggerated cardiac
remodelling in response to hypertrophic stimuli. To our knowl￾edge, this report is the first to identify IRF8 as a negative regulator
of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
In past decades, genetically modified animal models have
identified numerous pro-hypertrophic signalling pathways4,26.
These pathways activate various transcriptional factors, driving
expression of fetal cardiac and stress response genes and resulting
in pathological cardiac hypertrophy4. Thus far, the best known of
these transcriptional factors associated with cardiac hypertrophy
are members of the NFAT family, including NFATc1, NFATc2,
NFATc3 and NFAT5 (ref. 27). Generally, NFAT transcription
factors are hyperphosphorylated and sequestered in the
cytoplasm. Once dephosphorylated by activated calcineurin
(CaN), NFATs rapidly translocate to the nucleus, where they
work in coordination with other transcription factors to activate HW/BW (mg g–1) HW/TL (mg mm–1)

downstream targets24. Various genetic approaches have been
applied to demonstrate the importance of the NFAT signalling
pathway in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy28. For example,
cardiac-specific activation of NFAT by the constitutively active
calcineurin catalytic subunit was shown to induce massive cardiac
hypertrophy that quickly transitioned to heart failure and death
in mice29. Conversely, the genetic inhibition of NFAT by different
transgenic approaches (that is, overexpression of the calcineurin
inhibitors Cabin1/Cain, AKAP79, MCIP1 and dnCaN) was
shown to attenuate the hypertrophic response to a wide variety
of acute stimuli in vivo30–32. Thus, molecules that selectively
inhibit NFAT activation can be of great therapeutic interest in the
treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.
The identification of NFATc1 as an IRF8-interacting protein in
the present study provides mechanistic insight into the relation￾ship between IRF8 deficiency/overexpression and NFATc1
activation pertaining to cardiac hypertrophic states. Whereas
cardiac IRF8 overexpression hampered NFATc1 nuclear translo￾cation, IRF8 deficiency facilitated NFATc1 activation, providing
evidence of the inhibitory effect of IRF8 on NFATc1. Such
findings are consistent with a previous study that showed that
IRF8 acts as a modifier of NFAT in osteoclast precursors14.
Furthermore, activation of NFATc1 by the overexpression of its
constitutively active form negated the protective effects of IRF8
on cardiac hypertrophy in mice; whereas the suppression of
NFATc1 by VIVIT, a selective peptide inhibitor, prevented
abnormalities in IRF8-null mice in response to pressure overload.
However, upon AB surgery, IRF8/CaNFATc1 DTG mice still
exhibited a reduced hypertrophic response compared with
CaNFATc1-TG mice (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus,
the inhibitory effects of IRF8 on cardiac hypertrophy might not
be dependent only on the blocking of NFATc1 signalling. Based
on our finding that IRF8 expression was significantly
downregulated in DCM and HCM human hearts and
hypertrophic murine hearts, we speculate that elevating the
IRF8 level might represent a new strategy for treating
hypertrophic heart disease that is worthy of additional
validation and investigation. We further provide evidence that
IRF8 physically interacts with NFATc1, which might render it
inaccessible to activation by upstream phosphatases (that is, CaN)
or kinases (that is, GSK). Intriguingly, we found that the
IRF-associated domain (IAD1:200–377 aa) was required for
IRF8 to inhibit NFATc1 activity. Our findings presented here
suggest that the 200–377 aa of IRF8 involved in binding to
NFATc1 might constitute a novel peptide inhibitor of NFATc1.
However, future studies will be necessary to specify the active
domain of IAD1 involved in blocking NFATc1 activity, and to
determine its therapeutic potential for limiting pathological
cardiac remodelling.
Notably, parameters of cardiac function are similar among
IRF8 þ / þ , IRF8  /  , NTG and IRF8-TG mice (Supplementary
Table 1). Thus, the IRF8 gene expression pattern appears to not HW/BW (mg g–1) LW/BW (mg g–1) HW/TL (mg mm–1)

affect myocardial contractile function under basal conditions.
However, upon AB, wild-type mice (NTG and IRF8 þ / þ )
developed cardiac hypertrophy and eventually heart failure,
whereas IRF8-TG mice exhibited an attenuation of cardiac
hypertrophy and thereby avoided cardiac dysfunction. Therefore,
our results indicate that IRF8 might regulate cardiac function
under pathological conditions.
Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) constitute a family of
regulator factors comprising nine members (IRF1-9) in mamma￾lian cells9. Previous studies have revealed the versatile and critical
functions performed by this family in many biological
processes9,16. Once activated, the IRFs shape the appropriate
response by stimulating an overlapping but distinct set of target
genes33. The cooperation or competition of different transcription
factors of the IRF family at the DNA-binding level has been
demonstrated in in vitro studies34–36. It is therefore possible that
interplay exists among these different IRFs in the development of
cardiac hypertrophy. Our recent findings showed that IRF3 and
IRF9 protected against pressure overload-induced hypertrophic
response by inactivating ERK1/2 or myocardin, respectively37,38,
whereas IRF4 aggravated pressure overload-induced cardiac
hypertrophy by activating the transcription of CREB in the
heart5. In the present study, we demonstrated that IRF8 inhibited
pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by interacting
with NFATc1 to prevent NFATc1 nuclear translocation.
Importantly, recent studies have also shown that there is
cross-talk, including cross-inhibition or cross-activation among
NFAT, myocardin, CREB and ERK signalling during cardiac
hypertrophy39–43. These exciting cross-talk changes that occur
during cardiac hypertrophy are of great significance because
proper regulation of different pathways in the context of elaborate
and highly complex signalling networks within the cell is strongly
dependent on communication with other signalling molecules,
resulting in either synergistic or antagonistic relationships that
produce a spectrum of biological outcomes. Understanding the
nature of cross-talk between these signalling pathways is indeed a
major hurdle to understanding the molecular basis of the roles of
the IRF family in cardiac remodelling.
In conclusion, our present work provides both in vitro and
in vivo evidence that IRF8 functions as a novel negative regulator
factor of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. The mechanisms
underlying IRF8-elicited cardioprotective effects are associated
with direct inhibition of NFATc1 signalling, which suppresses the
hypertrophic response caused by chronic pressure overload.
These observations also provide new insights into the mechan￾isms of cardiac hypertrophy and could have significant implica￾tions for the development of novel strategies for the treatment of
pathological cardiac hypertrophy by targeting IRF8.

the entire coding region of mouse IRF8 into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the
pEGFP-myc-C1 plasmid. HA-IRF8 was PCR amplified from the cDNA of
HEK293T cells using the IRF8-50 and IRF8-30 primers. The IRF8 truncates,
consisting of residues 200 to 424aa, 1 to 200aa and 200 to 377aa, were PCR
amplified from HA-IRF8, using the IRF8-C-50 and IRF8-30
, IRF8-50 and IRF8-N-30
,
IRF8-C-50 and IRF8-IAD1-30 primers, respectively. IRF8 deletion mutant lacking
residues 200–377aa was generated by a one-step PCR-based mutagenesis procedure
using EGFP-myc-IRF8 as the template. EGFP-myc-IRF8 was amplified with IRF8-
dIAD1-50 and IRF8-dIAD1-50
. The PCR products were phosphorylated with T4
PNK and then ligated to generate EGFP-myc-IRF8D200–377. The Flag-NFATc1
and EGFP-myc-NFATc1 constructs were generated by amplifying the NFATc1
gene-coding region with primers NFATc1-50 and NFATc1-30 from HA-NFATc1,
and then they were subcloned into the plasmids psi-Flag-C1 and psi-EGFP-myc￾C1. The NFATc1 fragments, consisting of residues 1 to 205aa, 206 to 931aa, 1 to
426aa, 1 to 690aa and 579 to 931aa, were PCR amplified using the NFATc1-50 and
NFATc1-N1-30
, NFATc1-C1-50 and NFATc1-30
, NFATc1-50 and NFATc1-N2-30
,
NFATc1-50 and NFATc1-N3-30 and NFATc1-C2-50 and NFATc1-30 primers from
Flag-NFATc1, respectively. The products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and
ligated into psi-Flag-C1 to create an in-frame fusion with Flag. pmCherry-IRF8 and
GST-IRF8 constructs were generated by amplifying the IRF8 gene-coding region
with primers IRF8-50 and IRF8-30 from HA-IRF8, followed by subcloning into
pmCherry-C2 and pGEX-4T-1. The primers for these constructs are showed in
Supplementary Table 6. All plasmids were verified by sequencing.
Animals used for study. All the experiments involving animals were approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.
The following animals were used in this study.
IRF8  /  and cardiac-specific IRF8 transgenic mice. Full-length mouse IRF8
cDNA (Origene, MC200891) was cloned downstream of the cardiac a-myosin
heavy chain (a-MHC) promoter. The linearized a-MHC-IRF8 plasmid was
microinjected into fertilized mice embryos to produce cardiac-specific IRF8-TG
mice identified by PCR analysis of tail genomic DNA. The PCR primers were as
follows: forward: 50
-ATCTCCCCCATAAGAGTTTGAGTC-30
, and reverse:
50
-CCCACCAGTCAGGGAGGAT-30
. Four independent TG lines were established
and studied. IRF8 knockout mice (IRF8  /  , B6.129P2-Irf8tm1Hor/Kctt) were
purchased from the European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA, EM: 02414). The
IRF8  /  mice were crossed with C57BL/6J mice to produce the F1 generation
(IRF8 heterozygous), which was backcrossed with the C57BL/6J strain to obtain the
F2 generation (IRF8 heterozygous) and then further backcrossed to the C57BL/6J
background until the F9 generation (IRF8 heterozygous). F9 generation male and
female mice were crossed with each other to produce IRF8  /  mice (pure C57BL/
6J background). IRF8-Flox mice (B6(Cg)-Irf8tm1.1Hm/J) were purchased from
Jackson Laboratory (Stock No.: 014175). The male IRF8  /  , IRF8 transgene and
their wild-type littermates, aged 8–10 weeks old (with BWs of 24–27 g), were used
in the described experiments.
Cardiac-specific CaNFATc1-TG and CaNFATc1/IRF8DTG Mice. To obtain
the CaNFATc1 flox mice, we subcloned an N-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged,
C-terminal Flag-tagged CaNFATc1 containing serine to alanine substitutions in the
conserved serine-rich domain and all three serine-proline repeats (NFATc-mSRD￾mSPx3) into the CAG-CAT-LacZ construct, which contains a CMV enhancer and
a chicken b-actin gene promoter, linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
(CAT) gene and flanked by loxp sites. In this construct, CaNFATc1 expression is
blocked by the presence of the CAT gene; when the CAT sequence is excised by
Cre recombinase, CaNFATc1 is expressed. The CaNFATc1 flox mice were crossed
with mice carrying the a-MHC–MerCreMer transgene (MEM-Cre-Tg (Myh6-cre/
Esr1, Jackson Laboratory, 005650)) to yield CaNFATc1-Cre-TG mice. For cardiac￾specific overexpression of CaNFATc1, tamoxifen (80 mg kg  1 per day, Sigma,
T-5648) was injected for 5 consecutive days into MEM-Cre-TG ( þ ) mice
containing the CaNFATc1 gene at 6 weeks of age. The CaNFATc1-TG mice were
identified by PCR analysis of tail genomic DNA using the following primers:
forward: 50
-ATCTCCCCCATAAGAGTTTGAGTC-30
, and reverse:
50
-CAGGGTTGCTGTAGACG-30
. IRF8-TG mice were crossed with CaNFATc1-
Cre-TG mice to breed CaNFATc1-Cre/IRF8 double transgenic (DTG) mice. MEM￾Cre-TG mice served as the controls. All the experiments were performed in male
mice aged 8–10 weeks old (BW 24–27 g).
Cardiac-specific NFAT-luc TG mice. To determine the effect of IRF8 on the
transcriptional activity of NFAT in vivo, NFAT-luc TG mice (B6; FVB-TG (Myh6/
NFAT-luc)1 Jmol J  1) were ordered from Jackson Laboratory (013781) and were
backcrossed as described above. Then, we crossed mice containing the cardiac￾specific IRF8 transgene or IRF8  /  mice with mice containing the NFAT￾luciferase reporter transgene to produce cardiac-specific IRF8-TG or IRF8  / 
mice containing the NFAT-luciferase reporter gene.
Mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (50 mg kg-, intraperitoneal,
Sigma), and the adequacy of the anaesthesia was confirmed by the absence of a toe
pinch reflex. All surgeries and subsequent analyses were performed in a blinded
fashion.
Aortic banding. Cardiac hypertrophy mouse models were induced by AB3,5,6,37.
Briefly, the left chest of each mouse was opened to identify the thoracic aorta by
blunt dissection at the second intercostal space after anesthetization with
pentobarbital sodium and the absence of any toe pinch reflex. We then performed
AB using 7–0 silk sutures to band the thoracic aorta against a 27-gauge (BWs of
24–25 g) or 26-gauge (BWs of 26–27 g) needle. The needle was removed before

closing the thoracic cavity. In addition, adequate constriction of the aorta was
determined by Doppler analysis. A similar procedure, without constricting the
aorta, was performed in the sham-operated group.
Treatment of mice with VIVIT. VIVIT, an NFAT inhibitor, was purchased from
Millipore (480401). The VIVIT powder was dissolved in purified water and then
filtered with a 0.22 mm membrane. VIVIT (10 mg kg  1 per day) was continuously
infused over a 2-week period using an Alzet 1002 osmotic minipump implanted
subcutaneously over the dorsal thorax.
Echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements. Echocardiography and
hemodynamic measurements were performed at the indicated times after the mice
were anesthetized using 1.5–2% isoflurane3,5,6,22,37,44,45. For echocardiography,
M-mode images derived from the short axis of the LV were recorded using a
Mylab30CV (ESAOTE) machine with a 15-MHz probe. To measure the LVEDD,
LVESD and LVFS (LVFS (%) ¼ (LVEDD-LVESD)/LVEDD  100%), M-mode
measurements of the LV internal diameter were obtained from at least three beats
and then averaged. Cardiac catheterization studies were performed using a 1.4-
French Millar catheter-tip micromanometer catheter (SPR-839; Millar
Instruments), which was inserted through the right carotid artery into the left
ventricle. The pressure and dp/dt were recorded continuously with an Aria
pressure-volume conductance system coupled to a Powerlab/4SP A/D converter
and were stored and displayed on a personal computer.
Histological analysis. Hearts were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in
paraffin using standard histological procedures. Subsequently, these hearts were
sectioned transversely at 5 mm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for
histopathology or with PSR to evaluate collagen deposition. The myocyte cross
sectional area was measured using a quantitative digital image analysis system
(Image-Pro Plus, version 6.0) from images captured from FITC-conjugated wheat
germ agglutinin (WGA, Invitrogen) stained sections. More than 100 myocytes in
the sections were outlined in each group.
Cultured NRCMs and recombinant adenoviral vectors. Primary cultures of
NRCMs were prepared according to the following protocol3,5,6. Briefly, PBS
containing 0.03% trypsin and 0.04% collagenase type II was used to isolate
cardiomyocytes from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague–Dawley rats. After removing
fibroblasts by a differential attachment technique, NRCMs were seeded at a density
of 2  105 cells per well onto six-well culture plates coated with gelatin in plating
medium consisting of DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf
serum, BrdU (0.1 mM, to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts) and penicillin/
streptomycin. After 48 h, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free
DMEM/F12 for 12 h prior to stimulation with angiotensin II (Ang II, 1 mM) or
phenylephrine (PE, 100 mM). To overexpress IRF8, the entire coding region of the
rat IRF8 gene, under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was encompassed
by replication-defective adenoviral vectors. A similar adenoviral vector encoding
the green fluorescent protein gene was used as a control. To knockdown IRF8
expression, three rat shIRF8 constructs were obtained from SABiosciences
(KR59496G). The construct that decreased IRF8 levels to the greatest extent was
selected for all further experiments. AdshRNA was the non-targeting control.
NCRMs were infected with adenovirus in diluted media at a multiplicity of
infection of 100 for 24 h.
Immunofluorescence analysis. The NRCMs was stained with a-actinin antibody
to assess the cell surface area, and NFATc1 localization in H9C2 cells and NRCMs
was determined by immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, cardiomyocytes were
stimulated with 1 mM of Ang II for 48 h after infection with different adenoviruses
for 24 h. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at
room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 40 min and
stained with a-actinin (1:100 dilution) using standard immunofluorescence
staining techniques. The H9C2 cells were transfected with IRF8 or shIRF8 for 24 h
and were subsequently stimulated with 1 mM of Ang II for 2 h. The procedure was
the same as that used for cardiomyocytes staining with NFATc1 (1:50 dilution).
Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Total mRNA was extracted
from ventricles and primary cells using TRIZol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA
was synthesized using oligo (dT) primers with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Roche). Selected gene differences were confirmed by quantitative
real-time PCR using SYBR green (Roche) and the results were normalized against
GAPDH gene expression. The primers for real-time PCR are shown in
Supplementary Table 7. Total protein and nuclear protein were extracted from
ventricles and primary cells, respectively37. The protein concentration was
determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Fifty micrograms of
protein was used for SDS–PAGE (Invitrogen), and the proteins were transferred to
a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore), which were incubated with
various primary antibodies overnight at 4 C. After incubation with a secondary
IRDye 800CW-conjugated antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, at 1:10,000 dilution),
signals were visualized with an Odyssey Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences). The
specific protein expression levels were normalized to GAPDH for the total lysates
or to Lamin B for the nuclear proteins on the same nitrocellulose membrane. Full
gel scans are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.
Luciferase reporter assays. The luciferase reporter assay in vivo was performed
according to the following protocol28,46,47. Briefly, mice expressing NFAT-Luc
were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital solution (200 mg kg  1
intraperitoneal). The heart was isolated and lysed using tissue lysis buffer from
Promega according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, the lysates were
centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 r.c.f., and the supernatant was used to determine
both luciferase activity and protein content. Luciferase activity was measured using
a Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega), and a Single-Mode SpectraMax
Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). Protein content was determined using the
BCA protein assay kit, and this content was used to normalize luciferase activity
per sample.
Three copies of the NFATc1 binding site from the human IL-2 distal promoter
linked to the luciferase gene were cloned into the pGL3-basic plasmid to obtain the
NFATc1-luciferase reporter vector (p3  NFATc1-luc). NRCMs were seeded onto
24-well plates at a density of 1  105 per well the day before infection. Either
AdIRF8 or AdshIRF8 with AdNFATc1-Luc/BNP-Luc/MCIP1.4-Luc /EDN-1-Luc
was co-infected into cardiomyocytes. After 24 h of stimulation with Ang II, the cells
were harvested, washed three times with PBS and lysed in 100 ml passive lysis buffer
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell debris was removed
by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for the luciferase assay with a
Single-Mode SpectraMax Microplate Reader.
A Cignal 45-Pathway Reporter Array (SABiosciences, CCA-901L) was used
to rapidly identify relevant pathways for further analysis in H9C2 cells according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, we added 200 ng of green fluorescent protein
or IRF8 plasmid diluted in 50 ml Opti-MEM to each well of the Cignal Finder
Array plate, and then we resuspended the reporter assay constructs by gently
tapping the side of the plate. After setting the tubes at room temperature for 5 min,
0.6 ml of Attractene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) in 50 ml of Opti-MEM was
added to each well containing 50 ml of the diluted nucleic acids. After the 20-
minute incubation for complex formation was completed, 50 ml of a prepared cell
suspension (8  104 cells in Opti-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, FBS)
was added to each well containing the construct-Attractene complexes. After 16 h
of transfection, the medium was changed to complete growth medium (DMEM
with 10% FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U ml  1 penicillin and
100 mg ml  1 streptomycin). Finally, 48 h after co-transfection, luciferase activity
was determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Immunoprecipitation. Cultured HEK293T cells co-transfected with the appro￾priate plasmids were collected and sonicated in an IP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After incubating for 20 minutes at 4 C, fol￾lowed by centrifuging 13,000 g for 15 min, the cell lysates were precleared with
normal mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin G and protein A/G-agarose beads
(11719394001, 11719386001, Roche) for 3 h at 4 C. The precleared lysates (500 ml)
were then incubated with 1 mg of antibody and 10 ml of protein A/G-agarose beads
on a rocking platform at 4 C overnight. The immunocomplex was collected,
washed five to six times with cold IP buffer and blotted using the indicated primary
antibodies. Co-IP for endogenous proteins was performed in the cytoplasmic
protein of NRCMs isolated using an NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction
kit (Pierce, Cat number: 78835).
GST pull-down assay. The GST-IRF8 fusion protein was expressed in Rosetta
(DE3) Escherichia coli and was purified and immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose
4B beads (GE healthcare Biosciences AB), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In brief, the GST-IRF8 beads were incubated with Flag-NFATc1-
transfected HEK293T cell lysates in IP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% NP-40 supplemented with protease inhibitor cock￾tail) for 4 h at 4 C. The beads were then washed four times with IP lysis buffer in
the absence of cocktail. Eluted bound proteins were resolved by SDS–PAGE and
were analysed by western blot using anti-Flag antibodies.
Confocal microscopy. H9C2 cells were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates.
After co-transfection with pmCherry-IRF8 and pEGFP-NFATc1 for 48 h, the cells
were fixed using 4% fresh paraformaldehyde for 15 min, followed by three washes
with PBS and 5 min of permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed
by incubation in an Image-IT FX signal enhancer (I36933, Invitrogen) for 30 min.
Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with TBST and were stained with
DAPI (1 g ml  1, 15 min). The slides were mounted with mounting solution
(D2522, Sigma), and images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning
microscope (Fluoview 1000; Olympus).
Human heart samples. Samples of failing human hearts were collected from the
left ventricles of DCM patients and HCM patients (Patient 1: male, 23 years old,

Patient 2: male, 30 years old, IVS ¼ 20 mm, EF ¼ 66%; Patient 3: female, 40 years
old, IVS ¼ 25 mm, EF ¼ 58%; Patient 4: male, 50 years old, IVS ¼ 31 mm,
EF ¼ 74%) undergoing heart transplants6. Control samples were obtained from the
left ventricles of normal heart donors who died in accidents but whose hearts were
not suitable for transplantation for noncardiac reasons. Written informed consent
was obtained from the families of prospective heart donors. All the procedures
involving human samples conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration
of Helsinki and were approved by the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University
Review Board in Wuhan, China.
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as the mean±s.d. Student’s two-tailed
t-test was used to compare the means of two groups of samples, and two-way
analysis of variance with general linear model procedures using a univariate
approach was applied for more than two groups. All statistical analyses were
performed with SPSS software, version 13.0. Statistical significance was set at
Po0.05.
