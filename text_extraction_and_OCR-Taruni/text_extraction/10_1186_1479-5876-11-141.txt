Abstract
Background: The α2-adrenoreceptor agonist dexmedetomidine is known to provide renoprotection against
ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. However the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose
of this study was to investigate whether the Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/
STAT) signaling pathway plays a role in dexmedetomidine’s renoprotection.
Methods: I/R model was induced by bilateral renal pedicle clamping for 45 min followed by 48 h of reperfusion in
male Wistar rat. Sham laparotomy served as controls. Animals received dexmedetomidine (50 μg/kg, i.p.) in the
absence or presence of atipamezole (250 μg/kg, i.p.), or vehicle (DMSO) in the absence or presence of selective
JAK2 inhibitor tyrphostin AG490 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) before ischemia. Renal function, histology, apoptosis, expression of
cleaved caspase 3 protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)
and phosphorylations of JAK2, STAT1 and STAT3 were assessed.
Results: The animals treated with either dexmedetomidine or AG490 exhibited an improved renal functional
recovery, attenuated histological lesions and reduced number of apoptotic tubular epithelial cells. Either
dexmedetomidine or AG490 inhibited the phosphorylations of JAK2 and its downstream molecule STAT1 and
STAT3, accompanied by down-regulation the expression of cleaved caspase 3, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 proteins, and
significantly ameliorated renal I/R injury.
Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine protects kidney against I/R injury, at least in part, through its inhibitory effects on
injury-induced activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. If our data can be extrapolated to clinical setting, then
dexmedetomidine may therefore serve as a clinical strategy to treat/prevent perioperative renal I/R injury.

Background
Perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by renal
ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) is a common clinical
event caused by reduced blood supply to the kidneys be￾ing compromised during major cardiovascular surgery
[1]. Despite advances in preventive strategies and sup￾portive measures, AKI is still associated with prolonged
hospitalization as well as high morbidity and mortality
rates which have not decreased significantly over the
past 50 years [2,3]. Vasoconstriction, oxygen-derived free
radicals, loss of proximal tubular cell polarity and infil￾tration of adhesion molecules, which lead to impairment
of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion structures, have
been shown to be implicated in the pathogenesis of renal
I/R injury (IRI) [4]. Acute inflammatory responses initi￾ated during ischemia and reperfusion, characterized by
the induction of an inflammatory cytokine cascade, ex￾pression of adhesion molecules and cellular infiltration,
lead to necrosis and apoptosis of renal cells [5].
Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is among a number of
prophylactic and therapeutic measures that have been
used to reduce perioperative AKI [6,7]. It is a highly

selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist with sedative, anal￾gesic, sympatholytic and hemodynamic stabilizing prop￾erties [8]. Recent studies suggest that dexmedetomidine
has organoprotective effects, reducing cerebral, cardiac,
intestinal and renal injury which can be abolished by
atipamezole (Atip), an α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist
[9-14]. The α2-adrenoreceptors are widely distributed in
the renal proximal and distal tubules, peritubular vascula￾ture as well as in systemic tissues [15]. Dexmedetomidine
treatment has been found to inhibit vasopressin secretion,
enhance renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, and in￾crease urine output [16-18]. Dexmedetomidine also has a
cytoprotective effect against renal I/R injury. The combin￾ation of these aforementioned properties may contribute to
improving renal function under ischemic conditions
[14,17]. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of
dexmedetomidine’s renoprotection remain unknown.
It is possible that activation of Janus kinase/signal
transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT)
pathway is involved in the development of renal I/R in￾jury, during which many pro-inflammatory cytokines are
up-regulated [19]. The JAK/STAT pathway is composed
of a family of receptor-associated cytosolic tyrosine ki￾nases (JAKs) that phosphorylate a tyrosine residue on
bound transcription factors (STATs). JAK-mediated
tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT family members en￾ables translocation of these transcription factors to the
nucleus and lead to an augmentation of gene transcrip￾tion [20,21]. The putative JAK2 inhibitor AG490, which
induces inactivation of downstream STATs, protects
against ischemia-induced acute renal injury [19].
STAT3 knockout animals have revealed the pleiotropic
role of STAT3 in many organs and cell types including
the heart, skin, T lymphocytes, monocytes/neutrophils,
mammary epithelium, liver and neurons following is￾chemia [22]. It has been proven recently that STATs,
present in the mitochondria, modulate mitochondrial
respiration, regulate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
and inhibit the opening of mitochondrial permeability
transition pores (MPTP) [23,24]. Of all the JAK/STAT
pathways, JAK2 signaling through STAT1 and STAT3
are the best studied in diseases affecting the kidney.
An in vitro study has shown that dexmedetomidine
may exert a significant neuroprotective effect by in￾volving the activation of extracellular regulated protein
kinases (ERK) [25]. Interference with ERK and STAT
signaling pathways may also play a role in myocardial
I/R injury [20].
To the best of our knowledge, the internal mechanism
linking the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the
cytoprotective effect of dexmedetomidine on renal
issue following ischemia has not been identified. The
aim of the current in vivo study was to identify the
main JAK/STAT signaling pathway involved in the
dexmedetomidine-induced renoprotection against I/R
injury in rats.
Subjects and methods
Animals
Male Wistar rats weighing 250–320 g were obtained from
Animal Experiment Centre, Nanjing Medical University,
Nanjing, China. Animals were housed in temperature and
humidity-controlled cages and allowed free access to
standard rodent chow and sterile acidified water in a spe￾cific pathogen-free facility at Nanjing Medical University.
This study had prior approval from the Institute Animal
Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University and all
procedures described here were performed strictly under
our institutional guideline.
Treatment protocol
A total of forty-eight animals were prepared surgically
for renal I/R as previously described [26]. Rats were
anesthetized using with pentobarbital sodium (65 mg/kg,
intraperitoneally) and a rectal probe was inserted to
monitor body temperature, which was maintained at 38 ±
1°C by a heating blanket. A midline laparotomy was
performed and the abdominal cavity was fully exposed.
Bilateral renal pedicles were carefully isolated without
damaging the ureter and clamped by non-traumatic
microvascular clamps to effect complete cessation of renal
arterial blood flow. After 45 minutes, the clamps were
removed to allow return of blood flow to the kidneys.
Successful ischemia or reperfusion was judged by observ￾ing the change in tissue color from red to dark blue or
from dark blue to bright red respectively. Renal blood flow
was measured by Doppler to detect sufficient ischemia
had been obtained. Middle abdominal incisions were
closed in two layers and covered with antibiotic ointment
when the operation finished. The animals were allowed to
recover from anesthesia, remaining 48 hours in a
controlled-environment room with food and water freely
available. Rats in the sham group underwent laparotomy
without performing renal ischemia as controls.
Animals (n = 8/group) received dexmedetomidine (50 μg/
kg, i.p.) in the absence or presence of atipamezole (250 μg/
kg, i.p., 30 min prior to dexmedetomidine treatment), or
vehicle (containing 45% DMSO and 55% normal saline)
in the absence or presence of selective JAK2 inhibitor
tyrphostin AG490 (10 mg/kg, i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA) 30 min before ischemia. All animals were
euthanised by an overdose of pentobarbital sodium at the
end of the experiment.
Blood samples were obtained from the abdominal
aorta at the time point of 48 h after renal ischemia and
allowed to clot and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min.
Serum was separated and stored at −20°C for further
biomedical determination. 48 h after renal ischemia, the

right kidney was snap frozen at −80°C and the left one
was immediately post-fixed with 10% neutral buffered￾formalin solution for 2 h at 20-25°C, dehydrated with
ethanol and embedded in paraffin for further analysis.
Histological examination
Formalin-fixed renal tissue was dehydrated, embedded
in paraffin and sliced into 4 μm thick sections which
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological
lesion (acute tubular necrosis) was graded on a scale of
0 to 4 as follows and described by Jablonski et al. [27]:
0 = normal kidney; 1 = minimal damage (<5% involve￾ment of the cortex or outer medulla); 2 = mild damage
(5–25% involvement of the cortex or outer medulla); 3
= moderate damage (25–75% involvement of the cortex
or outer medulla); 4 = severe damage (>75% involvement
of the cortex or outer medulla).
Apoptosis assay
For detection of apoptotic tubular epithelial cells,
TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT)-
mediated digoxigenin-labelled UTP nick end labelling)
assay was performed by ApoTag peroxidase in situ cell
death detection kit (Roche, Basal, Switzerland). Briefly,
4 μm thick paraffin sections were deparaffinized, then
treated with proteinase K and subsequently incubated
with a mixture of nucleotides and TdT enzyme at
room temperature for 1 h in a humidified atmosphere.
The sections were further incubated with anti-digoxygenin
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at room temperature
for 30 min. The nuclei fragments were stained using 3,3-
diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a substrate for the peroxidase.
As a negative control, sections were incubated by omitting
the TdT enzyme. Apoptosis was also evaluated using pre￾viously defined morphological criteria [28]. These criteria
include eosinophilic cytoplasm, cytoplasmic shrinkage,
nuclear fragmentation, nuclear chromatin condensation,
membrane-bound cellular blebbing and formation of
apoptotic bodies.
Biochemical determinations
Serum creatinine and plasma urea concentrations were
measured by standard picric acid--based colorimetric
kinetic assay using an automatic biochemical analyzer
(Olympus AU2700, Mishima, Japan). Plasma levels of
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and mono￾cyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured
by ELISA according to the commercial kits Mouse
sICAM-1 Quantikine and Mouse sMCP-1 Quantikine,
respectively (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining of renal issue was
performed on formalin-fixed paraffin sections using a
microwave-based technique. 4 μm thick sections of the
fixed kidneys were dewaxed with xylene, hydrated in
graded concentrations of ethanol, and treated with
0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min to quench en￾dogenous peroxidase. The sections were heated in a
microwave oven in citrate buffer (0.01 mol/L, PH 6.0)
at maximum power (700 W) for 15 min, and then
cooled at room temperature for 20 min. The sections
were then incubated in 5% blocking serum for 30 min
and then in primary antibodies (p-JAK2 and p-STAT3
from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA;
p-STAT1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) at 4°C overnight. They were subsequently
incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies for
30 min and finally counter-stained with hematoxylin.
Sections incubated in the absence of primary anti￾bodies were used as negative controls.
Western blotting analysis
Frozen renal tissue from each animal was crushed and
lysed, subsequently homogenized, then centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 20 min. The extracted protein was
separated in a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE,
and then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellu￾lose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences, Little
Chalfont, UK). Membranes were blocked with 5% non￾fat milk powder in TBS for 1 h at room temperature.
Blots were further incubated overnight at 4°C with spe￾cific antibodies against JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3
(1:1000 dilution), STAT1 and p-STAT1 (1:2000 dilution)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and
cleaved caspase 3 (1:1000 dilution; Cell signaling, Bev￾erly, MA). All blots were then washed and incubated
with respective horseradish peroxidase coupled second￾ary antibodies (1:5000 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch
Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) at room temperature
for 1 h. The protein bands were detected by an enhanced
chemiluminescent detective system (Amersham Biosciences
UK Ltd., Little Chalfont, UK) and were quantified using the
Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
UK). β-actin was presented as internal control to calculate
the ratio of optical density, and values were compared with
those of sham controls.
Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as the mean ± the standard error
of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was carried out
using the SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., USA). Statistical
significance was determined by performing a one-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s correction for multi￾plicity where appropriate. A value of P < 0.05 was con￾sidered to be statistically significant.

Results
Dexmedetomidine treatment improved renal function
All rats survived the experimental period. The rat’s body
weight and body temperature during the operation did
not differ among groups. In contrast to the sham￾operated rats, animals subjected to I/R had dramatic
increase in serum creatinine and plasma urea level,
indicating renal dysfunction in the IRI and DMSO
groups (P < 0.01 vs. the sham group). Pre-treatment with
dexmedetomidine or AG490 was associated with a
smaller increase in serum creatinine and plasma urea
level (P < 0.05 vs. the sham group and P < 0.05 vs. the
IRI and DMSO groups) (Figure 1A and B). Atipamezole
treatment abolished the protective effects induced by
dexmedetomidine (P < 0.05 vs. the DEX group).
Dexmedetomidine treatment attenuated histological lesion
Representative kidney proximal tubule morphologic
changes are presented in Figure 2A-F. As expected, nor￾mal morphology of tubular architecture and tubular cells
were observed in the sham rats (Figure 2A). In contrast,
renal ischemia and reperfusion resulted in severe tubular
damage in the IRI group; the destruction included
widespread degeneration of tubular architecture, tubular
dilation, tubular cell swelling, cellular vacuolization,
pyknotic nuclei, severe tubular necrosis and luminal
congestion (Figure 2B). In the DMSO and atipamezole
groups, tubular damage was comparable to that seen in
the IRI group (Figure 2C and D). However, compared
with the IRI and DMSO groups, only mild damage in
renal histological architecture was seen in the DEX and
AG490 groups (Figure 2E and F). The histopathological
scores of renal tubular injury are presented in Figure 2G.
The scores in the IRI and DMSO groups were signifi￾cantly higher than that in the sham group (P < 0.01)
and also in the dexmedetomidine or AG490 groups (p <
0.05). However, this injury was significantly attenuated
either by dexmedetomidine or AG490 when compared
to the IRI and DMSO groups (P < 0.05). Renal protective
action was abolished when dexmedetomidine treatment
was preceded by atipamezole (P < 0.05 vs. the DEX
group).
The effect of dexmedetomidine on apoptosis of tubular
epithelial cells
To evaluate the apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells induced
by renal ischemia, a TUNEL assay was used. A large num￾ber of apoptotic tubular epithelial cells were visible in
the kidneys that were subjected to I/R in the IRI and
DMSO groups (P < 0.01 vs. the sham group). Either
dexmedetomidine or AG490 treatment was associated with
the occurrence of apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells (P <
0.05 vs. the sham group) which was less than that seen with
the IRI and DMSO groups (P < 0.05). In the Atip group,
atipamezole treatment cancelled the anti-apoptotic effect
induced by dexmedetomidine and the number of apoptotic
tubular epithelial cells was comparable to those observed in
the IRI and DMSO groups (P < 0.05 vs. the DEX group)
(Figure 3A-G).
The effects of dexmedetomidine on the expression of
caspase 3 in I/R kidneys
In contrast to the sham-operated rats, the I/R procedure
significantly increased the expression of caspase 3 in the
IRI and DMSO groups (P < 0.01). Pre-treatment with ei￾ther dexmedetomidine or AG490 was associated with a
rise in the expression of caspase 3 (P < 0.05 vs. the sham
group) which was lower than that seen in the IRI and
DMSO groups (P < 0.05). In the Atip group, atipamezole
pre-treatment suppressed the effect on caspase 3 protein
induced by dexmedetomidine (P < 0.05 vs. the DEX
group) (Figure 3H and I).
The effects of dexmedetomidine treatment on plasma
ICAM-1 and MCP-1 concentrations
Rats subjected to I/R had significantly increase in plasma
adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and chemokine MCP-1
levels in the IRI and DMSO groups in contrast to the
Figure 1 The Effects of dexmedetomidine on alterations of renal function following renal I/R-induced injury. Serum creatinine (A) and
plasma urea (B) were measured to assess the renoprotective effect of dexmedetomidine against renal I/R injury in the sham, IRI, DMSO, Atip, DEX
and AG490 groups. Data were represented as mean ± SEM (n = 8). *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 vs. the sham group. #

sham-operated rats (P < 0.01 vs. the sham group). Pre￾treatment with dexmedetomidine or AG490 significantly
reduced plasma ICAM-1 and MCP-1 levels (P < 0.05 vs. the
sham group and P < 0.05 vs. the IRI and DMSO groups).
Atipamezole abolished the effects on the level of plasma
ICAM-1 and MCP-1 induced by dexmedetomidine in the
Atip group (P < 0.05 vs. the DEX group) (Figure 4A and B).
Dexmedetomidine inhibited renal p-JAK2, p-STAT1 and
STAT3 protein expressions
P-JAK2, p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 proteins were mainly
expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells and stromal
vascular endothelial cells. Normal rat kidneys had weak
expressions of P-JAK2, p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 proteins
(Figure 5, 6 and 7A, respectively). Immunohistochemical
staining showed augmented expressions of P-JAK2,
p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 proteins in the kidneys of the
IRI and DMSO groups (Figure 5, 6 and 7B and C, re￾spectively). The expressions of these three proteins
significantly decreased in the kidneys of the DEX and
AG490 groups (Figure 5, 6 and 7E and F, respectively).
Atipamezole treatment abolished the effects on the in￾hibition of P-JAK2, p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 proteins
induced by dexmedetomidine (Figure 5, 6 and 7D,
respectively).
Blockage of JAK/STAT signaling by dexmedetomidine
To verify that dexmedetomidine exerted its renoprotective
effects via inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling, we performed
western blot to analyse the phosphorylations of JAK2,
STAT1 and STAT3. In the kidney of sham-operated rats,
there is a low grade of phosphorylation for JAK2. The ex￾pression of p-JAK2 protein significantly increased in con￾trast to total JAK2 in the kidney subjected to renal I/R in
the IRI and DMSO groups (P < 0.01 vs. the sham group),
but the expression of total JAK2 retain the level of the
sham-operated rats. Treatment with dexmedetomidine or
AG490 in vivo resulted in reducing the phosphorylation of
JAK2 (P < 0.05 vs. the sham group and P < 0.05 vs. the IRI
and DMSO groups). The dexmedetomidine-induced inhib￾ition of the expression of p-JAK2 was abolished by
atipamezole in the Atip group (P < 0.05 vs. the DEX group)
(Figure 8A and B). In the mean time, p-STAT1 and
p-STAT3, downstream molecules of JAK2 cascade, were
also significantly increased in the IRI and DMSO groups (P
<0.01 vs. the sham group). The phosphorylation of STAT1
and STAT3 was inhibited by either dexmedetomidine or
AG490 treatment (P < 0.05 vs. the sham group and P <0.05
vs. the IRI and DMSO groups) The expressions of p￾STAT1 and p-STAT3 in the Atip group were comparable
to those seen in the IRI and DMSO groups and higher than

Discussion
Dexmedetomidine has been described as a useful, safe
adjunct in many clinical applications. It has been found
that dexmedetomidine may increase urine output by
considerably redistributing of cardiac output, inhibiting
vasopressin secretion and maintaining renal blood
flow and glomerular filtration [16-18]. Hsing et al. sug￾gested that dexmedetomidine reduced sepsis-induced
AKI by in vitro and in vivo experimentation [29].
Dexmedetomidine is also benefit for the kidney suffering
from renal ischemia and reperfusion injury which may
develop AKI [14]. Therefore, dexmedetomidine pre￾treatment may be of benefit to patients with low pre￾operative eGFR (<60 ml/min or <40 ml/min) undergoing
vascular surgery (AAA, EVAR); cardiology interventions
(TAVI, complex angioplasty) or cardiac surgery [30,31].
These patients are known to have a high risk of develop￾ing postoperative renal failure, but we are unaware of
any clinical studies to assess this. In the present study,
the renoprotective effect of dexmedetomidine, a highly
selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist, was shown by an

improved post-ischemic renal functional recovery, atten￾uated histological lesions, reduced number of apoptotic
tubular epithelial cells and down-regulation of the adhe￾sion molecule ICAM-1 and chemokine MCP-1. The
major new findings of this study, in which we systemat￾ically examined the spatial activation of JAK/STAT
signaling pathway in the kidney following renal ischemia,
was that dexmedetomidine treatment inhibited the
phosphorylation of JAK2, accompanied by down￾regulation in the phosphorylation of downstream protein
STAT1 and STAT3. These results indicate that the
renoprotective effect of dexmedetomidine is at least

partially dependent on inhibiting the activation of the
JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
In line with previous studies, our data also showed
that dexmedetomidine’s renoprotective properties have
largely been attributed to its agonist actions at α2-
adrenoreceptors. Its protective effects against renal I/R
injury, which are abolished by α2-adrenoreceptor antago￾nists, have been reported in different animal models.
When administrated before ischemia, dexmedetomidine
improves renal function recovery, reduces the number of
apoptotic tubular epithelial cells and attenuates renal tis￾sue necrosis and histological lesions in a rat acute I/R in￾jury model [14,17,32]. It has been recently found that
dexmedetomidine reduces systemic levels of interleukin￾6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and high
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) following lipopolysac￾charide infusion or sepsis in animals, indicating its anti￾inflammatory effects against renal I/R injury [14]. We
did not explore the well described anti-inflammatory
properties in this study. However, we further demon￾strated that dexmedetomidine pre-treatment mediates
significant attenuation in the expression of the adhesion
molecule ICAM-1 and the chemokine MCP-1 in an
in vivo renal I/R model. We, for the first time, investi￾gated the relationship between dexmedetomidine’s
renoprotective action and the activation of JAK/STAT
signaling pathway, which is associated with signaling
cascades induced by renal I/R injury. The phosphoryl￾ation of JAK2, STAT1 and STAT3, reflecting activation,
were significantly potentiated after an ischemia and
reperfusion procedure [33]. Previous studies showed
conflicting results about the critical role of JAK/STAT
signaling pathway and the therapeutic effect of its inhibi￾tor (AG490) in regulating I/R injury. Sharples et al.
suggested that the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490
blocked the reduction in cell death observed with
erythropoietin (EPO) in a dose-dependent manner in an
in vitro study [34]. AG490 or its analogs could abolish
the renoprotective effect of ischemic or pharmacological
preconditioning [35] and promote apoptosis through
down-regulating phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3
[36]. In contrast, Ruetten H and Thiemermann C found
that AG490 prevented the multiple organ dysfunction
induced by endotoxic shock [37]. Pre-treatment or im￾mediate post-ischemia treatment of AG490 significantly
ameliorated renal injury via the inactivation of JAK/
STAT signaling pathway in a recent study [19]. We
found that AG490 down-regulated its downstream
molecules, STAT1 and STAT3, but this was associated
with improved renal function and attenuated histo￾logical lesions against renal I/R injury. In addition,
dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the expression
of phosphorylated forms of JAK2, STAT1 and STAT3,
and provided the same renoprotective effect as AG490
in our study. Our results indicated that dexmedetomidine’s
renoprotective effect was at least partially dependent on
inhibiting the activation of JAK/STAT signaling path￾way induced by renal I/R, which may contribute to
ameliorating renal injury. The present study suggested
that dexmedetomidie and tyrphostin AG490 acted on
the same cascade.
To further elucidate whether down-regulation of JAK/
STAT signaling pathway is involved in the renoprotective
properties induced by dexmedetomidine in an in vivo I/
R injury model, we performed additional experiments
after taking into consideration the following aspects.
First, consistent with previous studies [38-40], renal I/R
injury was accompanied with a dramatic increase in
plasma level of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. Second,
AG490 significantly decreased systemic level of ICAM-1,
while also inhibiting the phosphorylation of JAK2,
STAT1 and STAT3 in a renal I/R injury rat. Thirdly,
pre-treatment with dexmedetomidine conferred the
same effect as AG490 on ICAM-1 according to our
findings. The adhesion molecule ICAM-1 is respon￾sible for renal I/R-induced recruitment of granulocyte
and macrophage infiltration. Recent evidences suggest
that treatment with anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal anti￾body, ICAM-1 antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides
and ablation of the ICAM-1 gene result in less patho￾logical and functional damage in the rat subjected to
renal I/R [19,38-40]. ICAM-1 expression is transcrip￾tionally regulated by several pro-inflammatory cyto￾kines including IFN-γ via the JAK/STAT signaling
pathway in a STAT-dependent fashion [41]. It is likely
that the down-regulation of ICAM-1 expression medi￾ated by the inactivation of JAK/STAT pathway is liable
for dexmedetomidine’ renoprotective property against
renal I/R injury according to our results. Our findings
further suggest that either dexmedetomidine or AG490
pre-treatment is responsible for the inhibition of
granulocyte and macrophage infiltration, subsequently
ameliorating renal injury following I/R in vivo.
A growing body of evidence indicates that the inflam￾matory response, associated with pro-inflammatory cyto￾kines IL-1β, TNF-α and chemotactic cytokine MCP-1,
plays a major role in renal dysfunction following ische￾mia and reperfusion [42]. It has been found that α2-
adrenoreceptor agonist might attenuate the increase in
plasma level of IL-1β, TNF-α and improve survival
successfully after caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-in￾duced sepsis [43], and reduce the incidence of sepsis￾induced AKI by decreasing TNF-α and MCP-1 [29].
MCP-1 is an inflammatory molecule whose synthesis is
regulated by several signaling pathways. It has been
demonstrated that MCP-1 gene induction is blocked by
protein kinase A (PKA), p38 mitogen activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and JAK-STAT inhibitors [42,44,45].

Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated MCP-1 expression
decreased via blockade of the JAK/STAT signaling path￾way [46]. The up-regulation of MCP-1, which is respon￾sible for the inflammatory cascade response, is mediated
by the activation of IL-6-induced JAK/STAT pathway
[45]. However, the role of MCP-1 in dexmedetomidine’s
renoprotection and its molecule mechanism are not
unknown. In the present study, dexmedetomidine sig￾nificantly attenuated the I/R-induced up-regulation of
MCP-1, consistent with its inhibitory effects on JAK2,
STAT1 and STAT3 activation. Its inhibitory effects on
MCP-1 and JAK/STAT pathway were similar to the se￾lective JAK2 inhibitor AG490. Our results indicate that
down-regulation of MCP-1 expression is associated with
in vivo inactivation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway
following dexmedetomidine pretreatment in a renal I/R
model.
Apoptosis plays as a major role of cell death in the de￾struction of renal proximal tubule following renal I/R
[47]. To confirm the hypothesis that JAK/STAT signaling
pathway inhibition by AG490 is involved in regulating
apoptotic process in the tubular epithelial cells following
I/R insult, the TUNEL staining method was performed
and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression was detected.
The dexmedetomidine-induced inactivation of JAK/
STAT was observed with a reduced number of apoptotic
tubular epithelial cells and a decrease in pro-apoptotic
factor cleaved caspase 3, the same effects as AG490 in
the present study. According to previous studies, JAK/
STAT signaling pathway mediates cell apoptotic signals
through the induction of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and the in￾hibition of caspase 3 protein expression [19,36,48]. Indeed,
some studies have documented that dexmedetomidine sig￾nificantly attenuates apoptosis in the brain, intestine,
heart, testis, neutrophils and kidney during in vivo or
in vitro experiments [9-14,49,50]. Our results showed that
AG490 significantly suppressed apoptosis and reduced the
expression of cleaved caspase 3 protein following renal I/R,
which strongly indicate a possible interaction of the JAK/
STAT and the anti-apoptotic pathways. Additionally,
dexmedetomidine-induced anti-apoptosis is regulated by
the JAK/STAT pathway, contributing to its renoprotective
effects on renal injury.
In summary, renal I/R injury leads to the deterioration
of renal function and histological lesions, enhanced
apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells and the expression of
protein caspase 3, accompanied by up-regulation of the
adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and chemokine MCP-1. We
demonstrate that dexmedetomidine treatment results in
a partial, but significant, attenuation of renal damage
induced by I/R injury through the inactivation of
JAK/STAT signaling pathway in an in vivo model.
Atipamezole abolished the renoprotective effect that was
conferred by dexmedetomidine administrated before
ischemia. Furthermore, inhibiting the JAK/STAT path￾way with selective JAK2 inhibitor AG490 ameliorates the
pathogenesis of renal I/R injury. Similar to the effects of
AG490, dexmedetomidine produces its renoprotective
effect by regulating the activation of the JAK/STAT sig￾naling pathway, indicating intervention targeted at this
signal transduction pathway may have therapeutic po￾tential for treatment of perioperative AKI.
Conclusions
Our studies showed that dexmedetomidine protects kid￾ney against I/R injury, at least in part, through its inhibi￾tory effects on injury-induced activation of JAK/STAT
signaling pathway. If our data can be extrapolated to
clinical setting, then dexmedetomidine may therefore
serve as a clinical strategy to treat/prevent perioperative
renal I/R injury.
