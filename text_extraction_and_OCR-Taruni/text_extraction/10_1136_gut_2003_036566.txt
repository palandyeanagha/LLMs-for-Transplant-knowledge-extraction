Background: Hepatic steatosis is associated with obesity and type II diabetes. Proton magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (1
H MRS) is a non-invasive method for measurement of tissue fat content, including
intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCL) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL).
Patients and methods: We used 1
H MRS and whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the
relationship between IHCL accumulation, total body adipose tissue (AT) content/distribution, and IMCL
content in 11 subjects with biopsy proven hepatic steatosis and 23 normal volunteers.
Results: IHCL signals were detectable in all subjects but were significantly greater in hepatic steatosis
(geometric mean (GM) 11.5 (interquartile range (IQR) 7.0–39.0)) than in normal volunteers (GM 2.7 (IQR
0.7–9.3); p = 0.02). In the study group as a whole, IHCL levels were significantly greater in overweight
compared with lean subjects (body mass index (BMI) .25 kg/m2 (n = 23): GM 7.7 (IQR 4.0–28.6) v BMI
,25 kg/m2 (n = 11): GM 1.3 (IQR 0.3–3.6; p = 0.004)). There was a significant association between IHCL
content and indices of overall obesity (expressed as a percentage of body weight) for total body fat
(p = 0.001), total subcutaneous AT (p = 0.007), and central obesity (subcutaneous abdominal AT
(p = 0.001) and intra-abdominal AT (p = 0.001)), after allowing for sex and age. No correlation between
IHCL content and IMCL was observed. A significant correlation was observed between serum alanine
aminotransferase and liver fat content (r = 0.57, p = 0.006).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that hepatic steatosis appears to be closely related to body adiposity,
especially central obesity. MRS may be a useful method for monitoring IHCL in future interventional
studies.
F
at accumulation in the liver is commonly associated with
obesity, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes, although
the mechanism underlying this relationship is not fully
understood.1–7
Until recently, the sole method available for quantification
of intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) content was through the
use of liver biopsy techniques.8 However, this procedure has
many drawbacks, even when performed under ultrasound
guidance, including discomfort due to its invasive nature, risk
of infection, haematoma formation or more significant
internal bleeding, and potentially biliary leakage. These
factors make the use of percutaneous biopsy ethically
difficult in a research context and impractical for longitudinal
studies. Furthermore, biopsies are subject to sampling error,
providing quantitative information on a rather small volume
(,0.01–0.05 ml) of liver, which may be of limited use in the
presence of heterogeneous IHCL distribution. Ultrasound,
computerised tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) can be used to detect fatty liver but are not
routinely used to provide quantitative information of fat
content, although methods have been developed for using CT
to assess hepatic fat in a quantitative manner.9 10 However,
repeated CT scanning has significant associated radiation
exposure and thus is inappropriate in interventional studies
where serial measurements may be required. More recently,
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1
H MRS) has been
shown to be a fast, safe, non-invasive method for the relative
quantification of IHCL content.11–20 This imaging modality
should enable the true significance of IHCL accumulation in
the pathogenesis of conditions such as insulin resistance and
type II diabetes to be understood.1 2
Although the use of 1
H MRS to quantify IHCL deposition is
becoming more widely used, a number of important issues
still remain unresolved, including the relationship between
IHCL and other body fat depots and the impact of
environmental and genetic factors. Furthermore, studies in
cadavers21 suggest that the distribution of lipid in the human
liver is non-homogeneous.22
In the present study, we have utilised localised hepatic and
calf muscle 1
H MRS, in conjunction with whole body MRI, to
determine the relationship between IHCL accumulation and
whole body adipose tissue content and distribution in a
cohort of subjects with biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver
and also in subjects from the general population without a
history of liver or metabolic disease. The results suggest that
IHCL accumulation is widespread and appears to be closely
related to abdominal fat adiposity.

Helsinki. A cohort of 34 fasted volunteers was studied
(table 1). Eleven (four females, seven males) had previously
been diagnosed as having hepatic steatosis following liver
biopsy; the remaining 23 (six females and 17 males) were
healthy volunteers from the general population without a
prior history of liver or metabolic disease. These healthy
volunteers were recruited from the hospital staff or were
friends or relatives of the hospital staff. None had abnormal
liver biochemistry. No patient or volunteer drank alcohol in
excess of 20 g/day and none had a history of alcohol misuse.
Of the 11 patients who had undergone liver biopsy within
the previous six months for formal assessment of non￾alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), all had persistently abnor￾mal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated serum levels of
alanine aminotransferase (ALT: geometric mean 49.0 (inter￾quartile range (IQR) 28–93) IU/l) and/or serum c glutamyl
transferase (cGT: geometric mean 55.1 (IQR 29–77) IU/l).
Alkaline phosphatase levels were also measured (ALP:
geometric mean 66.4 (IQR 59–75) U/l). One patient had type
II diabetes, six had dyslipidaemia, and four were simply
overweight. All liver biopsies were examined by an experi￾enced histopathologist (RG) using the Brunt’s scoring
system, which includes grading (hepatic steatosis, hepatic
ballooning, portal and intra-acinar inflammation) and sta￾ging the degree of fibrosis.23 All had evidence of hepatic
steatosis on histological examination (grade 1 (mild steato￾sis) to grade 3 (severe steatosis)), four had evidence of mild
inflammation (grade 1–2 intra-acinar and/or portal inflam￾mation), and three had fibrosis (stage 1–3), but not cirrhosis.
The clinical details of the patient and volunteer populations
are detailed in table 1.
MRI of the liver
Imaging data were acquired with a 1.5 T Eclipse multinuclear
system (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, Ohio) using a
45 cm diameter elliptical body coil, a 14 cm diameter surface
coil, and a T1 weighted spin echo sequence with a repetition
time (TR) of 800 ms, echo time (TE) of 16 ms, and four
signal averages. Between 25 and 35 (depending on liver size
from pilot images) 6 mm thick transverse images were
acquired per subject. Images were analysed using an image
segmentation software program in which liver contours were
manually drawn for each slice.24 Liver volumes were
calculated from this by multiplying the liver tissue volume
of each slice by slice thickness (6 mm).
MRS of the liver
1
H MR spectra were acquired at 1.5 T from the right lobe of
the liver using a PRESS sequence (TR 1500 ms/ TE 135 ms)
without water saturation and with 128 signal averages.
Transverse images of the liver were used to ensure accurate
positioning of the (20620620 mm) voxel in the liver,
avoiding blood vessels, the gall bladder, and fatty tissue.
Spectra were analysed in the time domain using the
AMARES algorithm included in the MRUI software pack￾age.25 26 Peak areas for all resonances were obtained and lipid
resonances were quantified with reference to water reso￾nance, after correcting for T1 and T2. These T1 and T2 values
for IHCL were obtained by an experienced physicist (GH).
The following values were obtained: T1 of the CH2 resonance
of IHCL = 480 ms; T1 of the water resonance = 1230 ms; T2 of
the CH2 resonance of IHCL = 50 ms; T2 of the water
resonance = 36 ms.

Results are expressed as percentage ratio of the CH2 lipid
peak area relative to the water peak area.
To assess the reproducibility of the 1
H MRS results,
analyses were repeated in triplicate and the coefficient of
variation measured. Intra-examination reproducibility was
measured by acquiring three voxels in the same position in a
single examination while inter-examination reproducibility
was assessed by acquiring a voxel from the same position in
the liver, in each given subject, on three different occasions.
To determine potential regional lipid variation within the
liver, 1
H MR spectra were obtained in 12 volunteers by
positioning a same sized voxel in two different positions
within the right lobe of the liver (fig 1).
MRS of muscle
Proton MR spectra were acquired from 20620620 mm voxels
localised to the soleus and tibialis muscles of the left calf
using a PRESS sequence (TR 1500 ms / TE 135 ms) with 256
signal averages, as previously described.27 As in the liver,
analysis was carried out using the AMARES algorithm in the
MRUI software package.25 26 Peak areas for all resonances
were obtained and lipid resonances were quantified with
reference to total creatine after correcting for T1 and T2.
Total body adipose tissue (AT) content
Rapid T1 weighted MR images (TR 36 ms, TE 14 ms) were
acquired on a Philips 1.0 T HPQ system, as previously
described.28 All images were collected at isocentre to avoid
image distortion with the patient, in a prone position, being
moved through the magnet to acquire full body coverage. A
validated semiautomatic ‘‘in-house’’ program was then used
to segment and analyse the AT.28 Total body AT, subcuta￾neous, total internal, subcutaneous abdominal, and intra￾abdominal AT volumes were measured.
Biochemistry
Blood was drawn on the same day as the initial MR scan for
serum ALT, ALP, and cGT measurements, as recommended
by the European Committee for Clinical Laboratory
Standards.
Statistical analysis
Normally distributed results are expressed as mean (SD).
Loge transformation was used for IHCL, liver volume, and
triglyceride levels in the liver and soleus muscle as their
distribution was positively skewed. Results for log trans￾formed variables are presented as geometric mean (GM) and
interquartile range (IQR). A two sample t test was used for
comparisons of two independent mean values. The relation￾ship between IHCL, liver volume, and individual AT depots
was examined using multiple regression analysis to assess
the independent effects of regional adiposity. Multiple
regression analysis was performed to predict liver fat from
the percentage fat in each compartment after adjusting for
age and sex. The level of significance was set at 5%. Data were
analysed by CD using Stata (StataCorp 2001 Stata Statistical
Software, Release 7.0; Stata Corporation, College Station,
Texas, USA).
RESULTS
Results of the liver MRS, muscle MRS, whole body AT
content measurement, and blood biochemistry in the NASH
and control groups are summarised in table 1.
1H MRS of the liver
Typical 1
H MR spectra from the liver of subjects with
different degrees of fatty infiltration are shown in fig 2.
IHCL was detectable by MRS in all of these subjects. Hepatic
water was used as an internal standard, giving a geometric
mean IHCL CH2/water content for this cohort of subjects of
11.5 (IQR 7.0–39.0, range 1.3–74.9).
To assess the presence of IHCL accumulation in otherwise
normal individuals without a history of abnormal liver
function tests, 1
H MR spectra were obtained from 23 healthy
volunteers with no known history of metabolic or liver
disease. IHCL was detectable in all 23 subjects, with no
significant differences between male and female volunteers
(male GM 4.7 (IQR 1.8–10.8) v female GM 3.7 (IQR 0.3–
28.6); p = 0.72). However, the geometric mean content for
these subjects, separately or together, was significantly lower
(2.7 (IQR 0.7–9.3, range 0.2–77.4); p = 0.02) than for those
with biopsy proven fatty liver infiltration (table 1). This
difference was not related to potential differences in MR
relaxation characteristics (T1 and T2) in these subjects, as
increasing the repetition time (TR = 20 s) or decreasing echo
time (TE = 40 ms) had little effect on the observed inter￾individual differences (results not shown).
Reproducibility
Mean inter-examination coefficient of variation (CoV) for
IHCL CH2/water examination, assessed by taking the subject
in and out of the scanner several times, then repeating
imaging and repositioning the voxel each time, was found to
be 7.0% (range 4.0–11.7%). As expected, the mean intra￾examination CoV was significantly lower (6.0%).
Heterogeneity of liver fat
In a randomly selected subcohort of 12 subjects, 1
H MR
spectra were obtained from two different locations within the
right lobe of the liver. Overall, there appeared to be no
significant regional differences in relative levels of IHCL
although there was substantial interindividual variation,
with some volunteers having a difference in fat content of
up to 50% between regions whereas in others it was less than
1% (fig 3). This variation in fat content did not appear to be
related to anatomy or the relative amount of fat present in
the liver.
Liver volumes
Liver volumes were obtained from the MRI images acquired
during the examination and ranged in size from 1.36 to 3.0 l.
To evaluate the reproducibility of liver volumes, each volume

was measured three times in a subset of 12 subjects; the
mean CoV for measurement of liver volume was 1.16%.
As expected, the volume of a subject’s liver was related to
IHCL content (r = 0.62, p,0.01). There were also significant
correlations between liver volume and body weight (r = 0.72,
p,0.01), BMI (r = 0.55, p,0.01), intra-abdominal AT
(r = 0.61, p,0.01), non-abdominal internal AT (r = 0.44,
p = 0.03), and intra-abdominal AT as a percentage of body
weight (r = 0.40, p = 0.05).
IHCL and whole body AT content
A wide range of IHCL content was observed in our cohort of
subjects. Examining the total group with respect to BMI,
independent of whether they were in the NASH or control
group, overweight and obese subjects generally showed
significantly higher levels compared with lean subjects
(BMI .25 kg/m2 (n = 23): GM 7.7 (IQR 4.0–28.6) v BMI
,25 kg/m2 (n = 11): GM 1.3 (IQR 0.3–3.6); p = 0.004).
Multiple regression analysis revealed, after allowing for sex
and age, a significant relationship between IHCL content of
the liver and
(a) total body fat expressed as a percentage of body weight
(IHCL increased by 22% for each 1% increase in AT (95%
confidence interval (CI) 10–36%); p = 0.001),
(b) regional adiposity (IHCL increased by 21% for each 1%
increase in total subcutaneous AT (95% CI 6–38%;
p = 0.007), and
(c) central obesity (IHCL increased by 72% for each 1%
increase in subcutaneous abdominal AT (95% CI 27–
133%), p = 0.001, and IHCL increased by 104% for each
1% increase in intra-abdominal AT (95% CI 37–205%),
p = 0.001).
Including an additional term for the NASH population did
not significantly improve the fit of any of the multiple
regression models.
IHCL and IMCL content
Multiple regression analysis showed no significant correla￾tion between IHCL and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) in the
tibialis and soleus although there was a significant relation￾ship between these fat depots (tibialis muscle, p = 0.004;
soleus muscle, p = 0.04) and percentage body fat, after
accounting for sex and age.
IHCL and LFTs
The relationship between IHCL and the results of LFTs was
also investigated. Multiple regression analyses revealed a
significant relationship between ALT and liver fat content
(r = 0.57, p = 0.006) (fig 4) but not between IHCL and either
ALP or cGT.
DISCUSSION
This in vivo study aimed to evaluate the relationship between
IHCL levels and body adiposity. The results show that
measurable IHCL is present in healthy individuals with no
history of liver function test abnormalities and no known
history of metabolic or liver disease. We have found that
IHCL is positively correlated to regional AT content. However,
we found no correlation between IHCL content and IMCL
content.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of the
relationship between IHCL level and body adiposity. In a
previously published in vitro study of 107 unselected cadaver
livers, Donhoffer detected IHCL in all subjects, with a
triglyceride content ranging from 1.7% to 25.6%.29 They
suggested that normal livers may contain as much as 5.5%
triglyceride (wet weight) and that a triglyceride content
greater than 8% may be a reliable sign of pathological fatty
liver.29 In our in vivo study, we also found a wide range of
hepatic fat content in the study population as a whole (GM
4.4 (IQR 1.3–12.4)), with resonances from hepatic triglycer￾ides observable in all volunteers examined, even though they
had no history of liver disease. Lower levels of IHCL (,5%)
were generally found in younger and healthier volunteers,
while older less active subjects showed higher IHCL content.
Similar findings have been reported in a number of in vivo
studies. Seppala-Lindroos and colleagues18 have reported a
wide range of IHCL deposition in the general population
using 1
H MRS. They subdivided their cohort of subjects into
low IHCL content (1.7¡0.2%) and high IHCL content
(10.5¡2.0%) although no clear physiological/biochemical
rationale for this ‘‘cut off’’ was presented. The former group
was associated with ‘‘healthier subjects’’, including signifi￾cantly lower LFT and plasma lipids levels although there were
no significant differences in BMI, percentage body fat, or
VO2max. Tarasow and colleagues30 have also reported wide
ranges of IHCL deposition by 1
H MRS in healthy volunteers,
attributing this to a possible tendency to obesity, while
Hwang and colleagues16 studied 15 non-diabetic subjects and
found IHCL content of 10.9¡7.2%. In subjects with familial
hypobetalipoproteinaemia, Schonfeld and colleagues31 found
increased IHCL content compared with controls although the
latter still showed considerable levels of hepatic triglycerides.
Liver fat percentages were 16.7¡11.5 and 3.3¡2.9.
The geometric mean for IHCL content observed in the
present study was similar (GM 4.4 (IQR 1.3–12.4)) to those
quoted in the literature, supporting previous in vitro and in
vivo findings that hepatic fat infiltration is widespread in the

general population.16 18 29–31 Indeed, the IHCL levels measured
in some of our volunteers were similar or higher than those
in patients with biopsy proven NASH, suggesting that those
individuals with biopsy proven hepatic steatosis/NASH
represent ‘‘the tip of the iceberg’’ in epidemiological terms.
Further work is however required to ascertain the ‘‘normal’’
level of IHCL in the general population and establish the
levels at which triglyceride deposition becomes pathological.
Interestingly, our preliminary results showed a significant
correlation between IHCL and ALT, but not cGT or ALP, in
the study population as a whole. This is surprising as an
elevated cGT is generally thought to be a serum marker of
hepatic steatosis with elevated transaminases considered by
many to clinically represent hepatic inflammation in NASH.
Previous studies have produced conflicting results with
regard to distribution of triglycerides in the liver. Kremer and
colleagues,21 in a study of 29 human cadavers, found
significant variation in the fat content across the liver. The
authors showed that the degree of variation was greatest in
subjects with the highest liver fat content.21 However, Gaal
and Husveth,22 in a study of nine dairy cows, showed that the
lipid content of a liver biopsy (0.08–0.15 g) was almost
identical to that from a large (150–200 g) liver sample taken
from the same animal. In vivo, Tarasow and associates30 have
reported a variation of 6.5–87.4% in IHCL from two different
positions in the liver in five subjects. Schonfeld and
colleagues31 have also reported considerable regional IHCL
variation, as well as diurnal alteration in liver fat content,
which emphasises the need for an accurate and reproducible
protocol in serial studies. In our study we have shown that,
although as a cohort no significant regional differences in
IHCL levels could be observed, a small number of individuals
showed large regional variations. This variation in IHCL
content did not appear to be related to total body adiposity,
liver size, or to depend on the amount of triglycerides present.
At present, it is unclear what factors may determine and
modulate IHCL accumulation in human subjects, both in
health and disease, but may include genetic susceptibility.
Further understanding of the possible heterogeneity of liver
triglyceride distribution is important as it may have major
implications for interventional studies.
The relationship between IHCL accumulation and whole
body AT deposition and activity is unclear. In the present
study, we have shown that there is a significant correlation
between IHCL content and regional adiposity, after account￾ing for sex and age. The relationship between liver
triglyceride content and adiposity suggests that IHCL
accumulation may be influenced by AT deposition and/or
activity, especially abdominal AT. Previous in vivo MRS and
biopsy studies examining the relationship between liver fat
and intra-abdominal AT in male and female subjects have
produced conflicting results. Seppala-Lindroos and collea￾gues,18 using in vivo MRS, reported no correlation between
intra-abdominal AT and hepatic fat in 30 healthy male
subjects. Similar findings were reported by Tiikkainen and
colleagues,32 who showed that during weight loss, decreases
in IHCL were independent of changes in intra-abdominal and
subcutaneous fat and that IHCL appears to be related to
dietary fat content rather than the size of endogenous fat
depots. Kral and colleagues33 also examined the relationship
between adiposity and hepatic fat. However, using multiple
regression analysis, they found that the waist to hip ratio
accounted for the degree of steatosis, evaluated by biopsy,
with weight, BMI, and body fat content having little
influence, suggesting that abdominal AT content is the
important factor in the development of fatty liver.
Combining all of these data, a picture emerges where IHCL
levels may not only reflect general adiposity but may be
related to the level of metabolic activity of the various AT
depots.34 Subcutaneous fat depots have been shown to have
significantly lower blood flow and hormone sensitive lipase
rate of action than abdominal AT. These functional differ￾ences may in part help to explain the large variability in IHCL
content in subjects with a similar BMI and percentage body
fat, as observed in our study.
Although the physiological mechanisms that mediate the
relationship between adiposity and IHCL accumulation are
yet to be identified, it is possible that levels of IHCL may
reflect AT depot activity rather than simply reflecting the size
of endogenous AT stores. Thus the high lipolytic activity of
abdominal fat depots, rather than its size, may be responsible
for IHCL accumulation in different individuals.35 Intra￾abdominal and abdominal subcutaneous AT may for example
lead to increased portal flux of free fatty acids to the liver and
increased circulating plasma triglycerides, respectively, both
of which could lead to reduced lipolysis and increased IHCL
stores. As free fatty acid flux from abdominal fat depots have
also been shown to correlate with insulin resistance,2 this
may represent a link between obesity, liver fat, and insulin
resistance.
In summary, this study has shown that liver triglyceride
deposition is closely related to abdominal AT content in
subjects with biopsy proven NASH and in healthy subjects.
The large individual variation may possibly reflect indepen￾dent genetic/environmental factors. Our results also con￾firmed the ability of MRS to study the process of triglyceride
deposition in the liver non-invasively. A combination of this
technique and 31P MRS, which gives a handle on cell
membrane turnover and fibrosis, may help in the future to
elucidate the underlying relationships associated with the
progression from fat infiltration of the liver to NASH and
cirrhosis.36–39 MRS also holds the promise of being an
invaluable in vivo tool in further human interventional and
genetic studies.40 41

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Robin Spiller, Editor
Oesophageal ulceration: more than meets the naked eye?
Clinical presentation
A 56 year old male presented with an eight week history of
dyspepsia, dysphagia, and epigastric tenderness. Symptoms
were controlled on a trial of proton pump inhibitor
(lansoprazole) but recurred when this was discontinued. He
also had a history of asthma, with numerous admissions to
hospital due to bronchospasm. His medications at presenta￾tion included fluticasone, ipratropium, and salbutamol
inhalers along with monteleukast and theopylline. He was
a non-smoker, was not diabetic, and had no other docu￾mented illnesses. Endoscopy revealed a focal area of
ulceration in the lower third of the oesophagus, in addition
to more extensive confluent ulceration in the middle third.
There was also duodenitis and ulceration of the first part of
the duodenum. The Clo test was negative. Oesophageal
biopsies (fig 1) confirmed ulceration of the oesophagus and
revealed acute on chronic inflamed granulation tissue.
Question
What is the cause of this man’s oesophageal ulceration?
