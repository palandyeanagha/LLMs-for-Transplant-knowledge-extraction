Recombinant human growth hormone treatment
in infants with chronic renal failure
H Maxwell, L Rees
Abstract
Poor growth is a particular problem for
children with congenital renal disease. A
one year trial of the use of recombinant
human growth hormone (rhGH) in eight.
infants and young children with chronic
renal failure is reported here. At entry
bone age was less than 2 years, mean
(range) chronological age 1-9 (1.3-2-7)
years, and glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) was 17 (9-42) ml/min/1*73 M2.
Height standard deviation score (SDS)
was -3'3 (-4.6 to -2.0) and height veloc￾ity SDS was -1-3 (-3.1 to 0.7). One child
was withdrawn when he received a renal
transplant after 9-5 months. Two children
required dialysis, but remained in the
trial. Treatment with rhGH resulted in an
increase in height SDS to -2*2 (-4.2 to
-0.9), p=0*0002, and height velocity SDS
to 1-1 (-0.7 to 2.6), p=0006. There was no
change in GFR and no serious adverse
events. There was no effect on plasma
lipids, calcium, phosphate, intact para￾thyroid hormone, or glucose. Alkaline
phosphatase rose significantly. Thus
rhGH improved growth in eight infants
with chronic renal failure, with four
children entering the normal range.

Recombinant human growth hormone
(rhGH) improves growth in older children
with chronic renal failure. "1 12 We present here
the results of a one year study of the use of
rhGH in infants and young children with
chronic renal failure, who were not growing
despite good conservative management.
Methods
Criteria for entry to the study were: (1) chronic
renal failure with a glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) of less than 50 ml/min/1-73 m2; (2) a
bone age of less than 2 years; (3) height less
than -2 SD or a declining height standard
deviation score (SDS) and no improvement in
growth despite correction of fluid and elec￾trolyte and acid-base balance, bone disease,
and diet (including a trial of tube feeding when
necessary); (4) absence of uncontrolled renal
bone disease; (5) age less than 1 year at
presentation of disease; (6) two previous height
measurements in the last 6 months.
Children were excluded if there were other
severe congenital abnormalities or if there had
been a previous malignancy.
Growth hormone (Genotropin) (Pharmacia,
Stockholm) was given as a daily subcutaneous
injection (0-14 IU (0 05 mg)/kg/d, equivalent
to 1 IU/kg/week) in the evening for one year.
Written parental consent was obtained.

Poor growth is a particular problem for
children with congenital renal disease.'
Growth in the first two years of life is greater
than at any other time; by the age of 2 years
children have attained half of their final adult
height.2 Ill health at this time results in a loss of
height potential. While subsequent growth in
the preschool and early school years is often
normal in these children, catch up is rarely
seen.3
Optimum conservative management, in￾cluding provision of adequate energy, cor￾rection of electrolyte disturbance and
acid-base abnormalities, and prevention of
renal osteodystrophy goes some way towards
improving growth, but many children remain
below the normal range.' 3-7 Nasogastric or
gastrostomy feeding to ensure adequate nutri￾tion improves growth in some,3 8 but not all
children.3 9
Growth in the first two years of life is
strongly influenced by nutrition. It is now
appreciated that the influence of growth hor￾mone is also important at this age; infants who
are later diagnosed as having growth hormone
PATIENTS
Eight children (three girls, five boys) were
enrolled. Mean (range) chronological age was
1-9 (1-3-2-7) years. Six children had congenital
structural problems, one had congenital nephro￾sis, and another had bilateral neonatal renal vein
thrombosis. Calculated GFR13 at the start of
treatment was 17 (9-42) ml/min/I *73 m2.
Birth weight was 3-19 (2-24-4.50) kg at a
mean gestational age of 36-7 (34-41) weeks.
Five of the eight infants had a birth weight
within the normal range; one child was small
for dates and one of the two premature infants
had a weight above that expected for gesta￾tional age. Growth data for the six months pre￾ceding the trial were recorded. At the time of
entry to the trial, height SDS was -3-3 (-4-6
to -2-0). Height velocity SDS in the previous
six months was -1-3 (-3-1 to 0-7).
MEASUREMENTS
The growth standards of Tanner et al were
used to calculate the height and height velocity
SDS.2

Pre rhGH On rhGH
Figure 1 Height standard deviation score six months
before, on day 1, and after one year of rhGH.
Children were seen three monthly, at which
time blood was drawn for estimation of urea,
creatinine and electrolytes, calcium, phos￾phate, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH),
fasting glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and
triglyceride. Height, weight, blood pressure,
and adverse events were recorded.
Results are given as the mean (range).
Statistical analysis was performed using a
paired t test. Analysis of variance for repeated
measures was used to compare multiple mea￾surements in the same individuals.
Results
Seven of the eight children completed one year
of treatment: one child was withdrawn when
he received a renal transplant after 9-5 months
of rhGH. Data from this child have been
included in the analysis. Two children reached
end stage renal failure and were begun on peri￾toneal dialysis, one after four months the other
after 10 months. These children completed the
study and their 1 year growth data have been
included.
Height SDS increased from -3-3 (-4-6 to
-2 0) to -2-2 (-4.2 to -0 9) (p=0Q0002),
fig 1; height velocity SDS increased from -1-3
(-2-7 to 0.7) to 1H1 (-0 7 to 2 6) (p=0 006),
fig 2. Height SDS calculated six months before
the study was -3 2 (-4.7 to -2-1), giving a
mean increase in height SDS during treatment
of 1H1 (0-4 to 1-7) compared to 008 (-0-6 to
0.6) in the preceding six months (p=00016).
Response to rhGH in this group of patients
was unrelated to GFR. The greatest increment
in height SDS was seen in the youngest
children (r=-0 794, p=0019) (fig 3).
There was no change in blood pressure
(table 1). Weight increased from 9 5
(7-5-13-8) kg to 10-6 (8-3-12-9) at six months
and 11-7 (8-9-13-8) after one year (p=0-008
v dayl). Weight, expressed as per cent of the
ideal weight for height, was 98% (79-18) at the

start of the study, and 96% (79-127) after one
year.
Calculated GFR (ml/min/1i73 m2) in the
children remaining on conservative manage￾ment was unchanged by rhGH treatment, at
17 (9-42) on day 1 and 17 (6-34) after treat￾ment. Results for creatinine, urea, and blood
pressure are shown in table 1. There were no
significant changes in any of these variables.
There were no consistent changes in plasma
calcium, phosphate, intact PTH, triglyceride,
or cholesterol (table 2). Alkaline phosphatase
was raised after six months (p=005) and
remained raised at one year (table 2). Plasma
glucose remained constant, but there was a
trend for an increase in fasting insulin (table
2). This was not statistically significant, pre￾sumably because the sample number was
small.
No serious adverse events occurred during
the trial.
Discussion
In renal disease poor growth in the first two
years of life can result in a significant loss of
height potential.' 9 Growth thereafter in the
preschool and early school years is often

but well below the third centile.3 4 Catch up
growth at this time is rare.3
At entry to the trial, mean height SDS was
-3X3 despite a mean age of just under 2 years.
A prospective study of growth in infancy in
chronic renal failure reported that the major
loss in height and weight SDS occurred within
the first six months9; this loss can be as great as
06 SD per month.5 Delay in diagnosis can
therefore result in a significant loss of growth
potential. Optimum conservative manage￾ment, with correction of electrolytes, acid-base
status, and calcium metabolism and provision
of adequate nutrition improves growth in
some3 8 but not all children with chronic renal
failure.9 12 Improvement is more common in
children who present to a paediatric nephrolo￾gist below the age of 2 years than those who
present at an older age.3
Traditionally, it has been thought that
growth in infancy is influenced primarily by
nutrition, but recently growth hormone has
been recognised as a contributing factor at this
age.'0 The use of energy supplements in
infants with chronic renal failure, by naso￾gastric or gastrostomy feeding if necessary,
does not consistently improve growth.389 In a
placebo controlled trial, rhGH has been shown
to improve growth in older prepubertal
children with chronic renal failure,'4 and to
maintain an improved growth velocity for up to
3 to 5 years, but there is little published data of
its use in infants and young children.'5 The
results of rhGH treatment in two boys aged
less than 2 years with chronic renal failure was
reported in abstract form (Linne et al, Pediatr
Nephrol 1992; 6: C118). Both showed a good
response to treatment.
Height SDS did not change in the six
months before the trial, while it increased
from -3-3 to -2-2 during rhGH treatment.
Each child showed an improvement, with four
children entering the normal range. The incre￾ment in height SDS represents good catch up
growth, and interestingly the greatest
improvement was seen in the youngest
children (fig 3).
The dramatic changes in height velocity in
the first two years of life make interpretation of
growth data difficult within this age group.
Height velocity SDS has been used to allow
comparison between height velocities at differ￾ent ages. Ideally comparison should be with a
placebo control group, but ethically this is dif￾ficult. With the small number of children
involved in this study, it was decided to treat all
children. Height SDS was used as the criterion
for entry to the trial. Annualisation to compare
height velocity at this age can be misleading
because of the changing velocity, yet observing
growth for one year to obtain an accurate
velocity measurement will only lead to a delay
in treatment.
Despite the low height SDS before treatment,
mean height velocity SDS was within the
normal range. This suggests that reduction in
height SDS had indeed started early.
Furthermore remarkable catch up growth on
rhGH was seen despite relatively normal height
velocity SDS values during rhGH treatment
(most values were within the normal range,
albeit in the upper half rather than the lower).
Although this is partly an auxiological phenom￾enon resulting from the high rates of growth
seen in infancy, it appears to be easier to achieve
catch up growth at this time compared with
later childhood,"I 12 15 a situation which is also
reported following renal transplantation.'6 17
Growth after infancy, in the late preschool
and early school years, is often normal in
chronic renal failure3 6; it remains to be deter￾mined whether or not children treated in
infancy with rhGH can maintain their position
within the normal range without further rhGH
treatment. Perhaps a short course of treatment
in infancy can achieve as much benefit as a
longer course later in childhood. The benefits
have to be weighed against the potential trauma
of daily injections in this age group. However
these children may need to remain on rhGH to
maintain a height within the normal range.
There was no change in calculated GFR in
the children who remained on conservative
management. Patients with acromegaly have
large kidneys that hyperfilter,'8 and rhGH
increases GFR and effective renal plasma flow
(ERPF) when given to subjects with normal
kidneys.'9 We have previously shown that one
year of rhGH treatment has no effect on GFR,
although there is an increase in ERPF after one
week, which is no longer evident at one year.20
The long term implications of these findings
are unclear. Two of the children were started
on dialysis; it is not known whether rhGH
treatment was implicated. The group included
several children with severely reduced renal
function; one child was withdrawn from the
study when he received a renal transplant.

Recombinant human growth hormone in chronic renalfailure 43
It has been much debated whether growth is
related to GFR per se. It has been reported by
one group' that growth declines when the GFR
falls below 25 mV min/1i73 m2, and by others
that good growth can be achieved in some
children even at a very low GFR values.5 6 We
were unable to find a relation between growth
rate and GFR either before or after rhGH
treatment, although it is noted that our group
of patients is small. The two children who were
started on peritoneal dialysis had the smallest
increase in height SDS.
No adverse events were reported during the
trial. There was no significant change in serum
calcium, phosphate, or PTH, but there was an
increase in alkaline phosphatase during rhGH
treatmnent, as had been reported previously
during accelerated growth in older children on
rhGH.II Baseline values of cholesterol and
triglycerides were variable, with no consistent
changes during treatment. There was a trend
towards an increase in fasting insulin during
rhGH, but no change in fasting glucose. The
same findings have been reported previously
with the use of rhGH in chronic renal failure;
fasting insulin returned to baseline during the
second year of treatment.'4
In summary, one year of rhGH resulted in a
marked improvement in height SDS in a group
of infants and young children with chronic
renal failure. Two children reached end stage
disease and required dialysis. GFR in the
remaining children was unaffected by rhGH
treatment. There were no serious adverse
events. Further study is necessary to determine
the role and optimum timing of rhGH treat￾ment in renal disease.
