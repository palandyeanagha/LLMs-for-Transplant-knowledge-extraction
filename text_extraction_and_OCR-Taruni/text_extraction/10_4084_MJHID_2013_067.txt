Abstract. Fournier’s gangrene (FG) is a rare but severe necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia 
that may complicate the clinical course of hematologic malignancies and sometimes may be the first 
sign of the disease. The clinical course of FG is very aggressive and the mortality is still high despite 
the improvement in its management. Early recognition of FG and prompt appropriate treatment 
with surgical debridement and administration of antibiotics are the cornerstone of the management 
of this very severe disease. A review of the scientific literature focusing on the topic of FG 
complicating hematologic disorders is reported
Introduction. Fournier’s gangrene (FG) is a particular 
type of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) involving the external 
genitalia and perianal or perineal regions with an acute 
rapidly progressive and potentially fatal course.1
Despite the first description of this disease was 
probably made by Ippocrates,2 this disorder is 
associated to the name of Alfred Fournier, a Parisian 
dermatologist and venereologist who firstly reported on 
5 cases of otherwise healthy young men with a rapidly 
progressive gangrene of the penis and scrotum without 
apparent cause.3
The term necrotizing soft tissue infection has more 
recently been proposed because of including all forms 
of the disease.4 In fact, necrotizing infection may 
involve all type of soft tissue while diagnostic and 
therapeutic approaches are similar, regardless the 
anatomic or depth of infection.5
FG is quite rare while mortality, despite advances in
management, is still very high, ranging from 20 to 
30%, depending on the comorbidities and the early 
surgical debridement and use of antibiotics.6 Indeed, a 
study analyzing English literature collected 1,726 cases 
of FG diagnosed from 1950 and 1999 worldwide and 
found that mortality was 16%.7 Surprisingly, a higher 
mortality rate is reported in the last years. In fact, an 
unpublished study cited by Mallikarjuna et al, 
Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2013; 5; Open Journal System 

collecting 3,297 cases from 1950 to 2007, reported a 
mortality rate of 21.1%.6 Moreover, the mortality of 
FG seems to be higher in developed countries, such as 
America and Europe, than in underdeveloped 
countries.7 Taken together, this data may reflect the 
impact on the pathogenesis of FG of antibiotic 
resistance due to the use/abuse of antibiotics in the last 
years.
FG may affects subjects from infancy to old age, 
either men and women (though less frequently). In the 
large series of FG patients reported by Eke the 
male:female ratio was 10:1.7
This is probably due to the 
fact that in women perineal region may better drain 
through vaginal secretions.
In Table 1 are listed some of the most frequently 
conditions associated to FG. Diabetes has been 
reported with a prevalence ranging from 32 to 66% of 
patients with FG, while alcholism showed a prevalence 
ranging from 25 to 66%.8-11 Small vessel disease, 
defective phagocytosis, diabetic neuropathy, 
immunosuppression and poor hygiene have been 
considered to explain the relatively high incidence of 
FG in these patients.1
Table 1. Most common comorbidities as risk factors for FG
 Diabetes
 Alchoholism
 Obesity
 Low socioeconomic status
 Acquired immune deficiecny syndrome (AIDA)
 Malignancies
 Malnutrition
 Prolonged hospitalization for debilitating illness
 Liver disease as cirrhosis
 Chemotherapy
 Intravenous drug use
 Iatrogenic immunosuppression (i.e., chronic 
corticosteroid use)
 Systemic lupus erythematosus
 Crohn disease
Pathogenesis and Clinical Presentation. Less than 
one fourth of cases of FG is now considered 
idiopathic.1,8 Colorectal sources (30-50% of cases), 
urogenital sources (20-40% of cases), cutaneous 
infections and local trauma (20% of cases) are 
frequently identified as the cause of FG. The infectious 
process is due, in the majority of cases, to 
multiorganism infection (spreptococcall and 
staphilococcal species, enterobacteriaceae, anaerobic 
organism, and fungi). FG involves firstly superficial 
and deep fascial planes of genitalia; subsequently it 
spreads along the anatomical facial planes and to 
overlying skin, while muscles are often spared. 
However, the early event of FG is a localized infection 
near to the portal entry followed by an obliterative 
endoarteritis with cutaneous and subcutaneous vascular 
necrosis, leading to local ischemia and further bacterial 
proliferation. Via Buck and Dartos fascia, the infection 
of superficial perineal fascia may then spread to penis 
and scrotum, and, via Scarpa fascia, to the anterior 
abdominal wall. Not surprisingly, testicular 
involvement is very rare because of testicular arteries 
originates directly from the aorta, with a blood supply 
independent from the affected region. 
The clinical presentation of FG is quite variable and 
a sudden or insidious onset may be both seen, the latter 
being more rare. Usually the infection starts as a 
cellulitis adjacent to the portal of entry, commonly in 
the perineum or perineal region. A strong fetid odour 
always occurs. Scrotal swelling, erythema, purulence 
or wound discharge, crepitation of inflammed tissue 
(due to the presence of gas forming organisms), fever, 
and pain are also frequently seen. The patients can 
rapidly progress to sepsis and multiorgan failure, the 
most common cause of death.
Laor et al proposed a scoring system, the so-called 
FG severity index (FGSI), to predict the prognosis.12
Table 2 summarizes the clinical and laboratory
parameters used. A score >9 is associated with 75% 
probability of death. On the contrary, a score <9 
increases the probability of survival to 78% More 
recently, Yilmasilar et al updated the FGSI by adding 
Table 2. Fournier’s Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI)

Serum bicarbonate (mmol/L) >52 41-51.9 - 32-40.9 22-31.9
Extent of the disease (dissemination score): FG confined to the urogenital and/or anorectal region, add 1: FG confined to the pelvic region, 
add 2; FG extended beyond the pelvic region, add 6. Age score: age ≥60 years add 1, while age < 60 years, add 0. This score, proposed in 
1995 by Laor et al [12], is based on deviation from reference ranges of the above parameters. Age and extent of disease have been added in 
Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2013; 5: Open Journal System

2010 by Yilmazlar et al [13] to improve the prognostic ability of FGSI. Each parameter is scored between 0 and 4, where the higher value 
indicates the greater deviation from normal. Score >9 correlates with increased mortality.

Diagnosis and Management. The diagnosis of FG is 
usually made clinically. However, imaging may be 
particularly helpful to identify the rapidly progressing 
necrotizing process and the severity of the prognosis,
that relies on the rapidity of diagnosis and the intense 
emergency management.
Computed tomography (CT) has a relevant 
importance in the diagnosis of FG because of its 
greater ability to identify and to evaluate the extent of 
the disease. CT scan can demonstrate asymmetric 
fascial thickening, coexisting fluid collection or 
abscess, fat stranding around the involved structures, 
and subcutaneous emphysema secondary to gas￾forming bacteria (Figure 1).14
Plain radiography may shows air within the tissue, 
while ultrasonography is able to differentiate 
intrascrotal abnormalities, may shows thickhened and 
swolled scrotal wall, containing gas inside.15
Essentials of successfull management of patients 
with FG include early recognition of the disease, 
complete surgical debridement and early institution of 
appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and 
supportive care for hemodynamic stabilization. 
Exploration and debridement must be undertaken as 
soon as possible.16,17 All necrotic tissue has to be 
removed (Figure 2). Because of testis are not involved, 
orchiectomy is performed rarely. Plastic reconstruction 
to provide skin cover may be useful to avoid infections 
and to accelerate the recovery. 
Broad spectum antibiotic therapy, empiric initially and

excision of the necrotic tissue. The testicles are preserved.
then adjusted when culture results are available, need 
to be instituted as soon as possibile. The combination 
of third generation cefalosporins or aminoglycosides, 
plus penicillin and metronidazole is the therapy of 
choice.6 The combinations of antibiotics should be 
effective against staphylococcal and streptococcal 
bacteria, gram-negative, coliforms, pseudomonas, 
bacteroides, and clostridium.6 Clindamycin, linezolide, 
daptomycin, tigecycline, and carbopenem may be also 
used.
Finally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may also be 
used in some selected cases, despite this therapeutic 
approach is still matter of debate.18
FG complicating hematologic disorders
We performed a review of the scientific literature
focusing on the topic of Fournier’s gangrene 
complicating hematologic malignancies. We searched 
the MEDLINE database using combinations of the 
following keywords: Fournier’s gangrene, hematologic 
malignancies, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute 
myeloide leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 
chronic myeloid leukemia. 
To the best of our knowledge, only 35 cases of FG 
associated to hematologic malignancies have been 
described to date (Table 3).19-40 The mean age was 35 
years (range 6-83 years). Thirty (86%) patients were 
male, while only 3 patients (14%) were female. The 
large majority of them (88% of cases) were 
complications of previously diagnosed hematologic 
tumors, while only in 3 cases of acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and in 1 case of NHL FG was the first 
sign of the diseases.24,29,35 Twenty-two patients (63% of 
all cases) had AML; among these, 13 had acute 
promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a unique subtype of 
AML classified as AML-M3 in the French-American￾Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2013; 5: Open Journal System

Bristish classification system, that has distinctive 
morphological, biological and clinical features. In 12 of 
these cases FG was seen as a possible complication of

activation of RARα and by inducing degradation of 
promyelocytic leukemia (PML)/RARα.
42 ATRA 
treatment is generally well tolerated. However, ATRA 
may cause leukocytosis and pulmonary complications, 
especially when used alone, with the possible 
development of the so-called “ATRA syndrome”.43,44
In addition, some other major side-effects can occur, 
such as dryness of skin, liver dysfunction, 
hyperlipidemia, bone pain, headache, fever, 
pseudotumor cerebri and Sweet’s syndrome. Scrotal 
ulcerations and necrotizing vasculitis may also be 
seen.25,45 It is reasonable to hypothesize that such 
lesions may progress to FG because of sovrainfections. 
Moreover, neutropenia may play a pathogenetic 
predisposing role. For those reasons, physicians must 
be aware that APL patients undergoing treatment with 
ATRA presenting with skin lesions may had 
necrotizing vasculitis needing carefully evaluation and 
prompt therapeutic approach.
Lymphoid malignancies, such as acute lymphoid 
leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), may be also complicated 
by FG that rarely, however, as reported above, may be 
the first sign of the disease.35
Moreover, FG has been observed in 2 patients with 
AML who underwent allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation (allo-BMT), 2 patients with AML who 
underwent autologous (auto)-BMT, and one boy with 
refractory AML who underwent unrelated cord blood 
stem cell transplantation (CBT).23,31 All patients 
developed FG during the severe leukopenic phase of 
transplant (ranging from day +6 to day +25, this latter 
in unrelated CBT). Of interest, the two patients who 
underwent auto-BMT were young women aged 25 and 
26-years old, respectively. Moreover, in all but one 
case Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from blood 
and tissue cultures, despite FG is generally due to a 
mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora. It has been 
speculated that severe and prolonged granulocytopenia 
may contribute to the development of FG associated to 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.31
Finally, only two cases of FG complicating a non 
malignant hematologic disorder, such as immune 
thrombocytopenia (IT), have been published so far. In 
the first case, a 68-year-old man with diabetes mellitus 
who was diagnosed with IT and treated with steroids 
and high-dose Ig without response. On day +36 he 
developed FG of perineal abscess.47 Klebsiella 
pneumonia was cultured from the patient’s blood and 
necrotizing tissue. The second one was an otherwise 
healthy 66-year-old man, in which steroids and high￾dose immunoglobulins were given with complete 
recovery of thrombocytopenia.46 However, on day +34, 
while on tapering steroids, FG developed as a 
consequence of perineal abscess. After debridement, 
antibiotics and reconstructive surgery FG completely 
resolved and pletelet raised to normal levels that still is 
maintained after 5 months of follow-up.
Overall, therapy for FG complicating hematologic 
disorders does not differ from that used in the case of 
FG associated to other diseases.
Conclusions. FG is a rare necrotizing fasciitis of the 
perineum with a usually aggressive clinical course that 
may complicate hematologic malignancies and, 
sometimes, may presents as the first sign of the disease. 
Despite the progress in diagnosing and managing the 
Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2013; 5: Open Journal System

disease, the mortality is still high, especially in 
hematologic patients with severe granulocytopenia. For 
that reason, early recognition of FG and prompt 
appropriate treatment have to be started as soon as 
possible. Finally, patients with APL receiving ATRA 
have to be monitored for signs and symptoms of FG 
because of the possibility of onset of onset of the 
appearance of genital ulcers and the onset of this severe 
complication.48
