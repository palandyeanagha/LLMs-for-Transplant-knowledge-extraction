diopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) in chil￾dren is rare and its prognosis is poor.1–3 RCM is not a
single disease and its etiology is unknown in most
cases.4 Because of its rarity, there is little information about
RCM in children in the literature, and not much is known
about its clinical course and outcome in this age group. We
therefore reviewed the clinical features, clinical course and
outcome of the cases treated at the National Cardiovascular
Center.
Methods
From 1977 to 2005 13 patients with RCM were referred
(8 males, 5 females). Their age at diagnosis ranged from 
4 months to 12 years (median 4 years) (Table 1). The 13th
patient, who had Noonan syndrome, was lost to follow-up
after 4 years, and was excluded from the study. The 3rd pa￾tient’s mother had RCM. The 7th patient had a history of
Rendu-Osler-Weber disease in her father and grandfather.
RCM was diagnosed by cardiac catheterization. The char￾acteristic hemodynamic feature of RCM is an elevated
filling pressure in the left ventricle (LV) associated with
normal or nearly normal systolic function.4 The restrictive
physiology is attributed to reduced diastolic ventricular
compliance. In this study RCM with hypertrophied LV wall
(LVH) was termed “restrictive hypertrophied cardiomyo￾pathy”, not hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, because of the
remarkable restrictive physiology.
All 12 patients underwent chest X-ray, 12-lead electro￾cardiogram (ECG), 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE)
and radioisotope perfusion myocardial imaging at rest.
Two patients underwent dipyridamole-loaded myocardial
perfusion imaging and 1 had exercise myocardial perfusion
imaging. Seven patients performed A Masters-double step
test and treadmill test, and 24-h Holter ECG data were
obtained for 8 patients. All 12 patients underwent cardiac
catheterization, including coronary angiography (CAG),
and 3 had repeat cardiac catheterization. Intracardiac pres￾sures were measured and the cardiac index and pulmonary
resistance were calculated. Right and left ventricular end￾diastolic volumes (RVEDV and LVEDV) were measured
by ventriculography, and were expressed as % of normal
by body surface area. The right and left ventricular ejection
fractions (RVEF and LVEF) were also measured. Endo￾myocardial biopsies were taken from the right ventricle
(RV) of 10 patients. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was
measured in 8 patients. The probability of survival time
was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method (survival time is
the interval from diagnosis to death).
Results
Age and Presentation at Diagnosis
The presenting features of RCM were as follows: abnor￾malities of ECG, 7; cardiac murmur, 2; and cardiomegaly, 3.
The age of the patients presenting because of an abnormality
on ECG ranged from 4 to 12 years (Table 1). Although the
presence of an abnormality on ECG was identified before
the age of 6 years in the 11th and 12th patients, cardiomy￾opathy was not diagnosed at that time. The 2 patients who
were referred because a cardiac murmur was detected were

Background Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is not a single disease and is rare.
Methods and Results The clinical features and clinical course of 12 pediatric patients with RCM seen
between 1978 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. The age at diagnosis ranged from 4 months to 12 years
(median 4 years). The age of 7 patients diagnosed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) ranged from
4 to 12 years. Three infants less than 2 years old presented with cardiomegaly. Obliquely elevated ST-T segments
and the late peak T waves on 12-lead ECG were present in 8 patients (67%). Three patients with ST depression
during exercise had no perfusion defects on radioisotope myocardial perfusion imaging. Two patients underwent
orthotopic heart transplantation. Of the remaining 10 patients, 7 have died: 4 died suddenly and 3 died of right
heart failure. Three patients with a hypertrophic left ventricular wall had a prolonged survival. The probability of
survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 78%, 52% and 26%, respectively.
Conclusions Obliquely elevated ST-T segments and the late peak T wave on ECG are characteristic, and reflect
the restrictive physiology, which may indicate abnormalities of repolarization of ventricular muscle. The mode of
death was either heart failure from pulmonary hypertension or sudden death from presumed ventricular arrhyth￾mia. (Circ J 2007; 71: 1534 – 1539)

each 4 years old. Three infants less than 2 years of age
presented with cardiomegaly and symptomatic heart fail￾ure. Gallop rhythm was detected by auscultation and 2 of
the 3 had hepatomegaly. One of the 3 had had been diag￾nosed as having asthma, because of the cough caused by
pulmonary congestion.
Chest X-Ray
A double shadow because of enlargement of both the left
atrium and the pulmonary artery trunk was observed in all
12 patients. The cardiothoracic ratio varied: <50%, 1 pa￾tient; ≥50% and <60%, 8 patients; ≥60%, 3 patients.
Resting ECG
All 12 patients had abnormal resting ECGs. Prominent,
tall P waves were present in 11, as were biphasic P waves in
the precordial chest leads (Fig1). The criteria for biventricu￾lar hypertrophy based on QRS voltage were achieved in 7
patients. All patients had narrow QRS complexes; 10 had
ST-T segment abnormalities (Table2). Obliquely elevated
ST-T segments and notched or biphasic T waves in the pre￾cordial leads were found in 8 patients (67%), and the peak

of the T waves was late (Figs1A–C). The corrected QT in￾terval was prolonged in 8 patients.
Three patients followed for more than 3 years had persis￾tent ST-T segment changes. The 11th patient with moderate
LVH had no ST-T segment abnormalities at diagnosis
(Fig 2A), but developed ST-T segment depression 4 years
later. Although the abnormalities of the ST-T segments
resemble the “strain pattern” of hypertrophic cardiomyopa￾thy, the QRS duration was normal. The ST-T segment
depression in the 9th patient progressed with progression of
the right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. In the
5th patient, a short run of paroxysmal atrial contractions
occurred 1 year after onset of RCM and 14 years later she
developed atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation.
24-h Holter ECG, Masters Double-Step Test and Treadmill
Test
Eight patients underwent 24-h Holter ECG monitoring
and 3 had paroxysmal atrial contractions; 1 patient (case no.
5) developed atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation and dysfunction
of the sinus node 14 years after the onset. Although 7 pa￾tients had ST-T depression during exercise, they had no
symptoms of ischemia (Fig 2B).
2DE
2DE revealed bi-atrial enlargement in all 12 patients
(Table 3). Left ventricular dimensions ranged from 72% to
135% of normal. The LVEF ranged from 48% to 79%.
Moderate LVH was found in the 5th, 11th and 12th patients at
diagnosis. The value of the E/A of mitral flow ranged from
1.3 to 3.6. At the time of diagnosis, mitral and tricuspid re￾gurgitation was slight or none in all patients. A large peri￾cardial effusion developed in 2 patients with heart failure
during their late course (patients 5, 9), 3 and 15 years after
the onset, respectively. The 5th patient had had a massive
pericardial effusion for the past 5 years. The first patient
with heart failure had progression of tricuspid regurgitation
and ascites in the late follow-up period.
Cardiac Catheterization
The pressure measurements obtained during cardiac cathe￾terization are shown in Table 4. The mean pulmonary artery
pressure ranged from 17 to 49 mmHg (median 25 mmHg) at
diagnosis. The LV ventricular end-diastolic pressure ranged

from 16 to 32 mmHg (median 24 mmHg), and that of the
RV from 4 to 27 mmHg (median 11 mmHg). The cardiac
index varied from 1.8 to 4.3 L·min–1·m–2 (median 2.8 L·
min–1·m–2), and pulmonary artery resistance from 1.4 to
12 U/m2 (median 3.7 U/m2). The RVEDV ranged from 72%
to 113% of normal (median 85% of normal), and the RVEF
was 39–70% (median 57%). The LVEDV ranged from 51%
to 103% of normal (median 86% of normal), and the LVEF
was 42–73% (median 61%). CAG was normal in all 12 pa￾tients. LV ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased
in all of the 3 patients who underwenta repeat cardiac cathe￾terization.
Endomyocardial Histology
Fibrosis of the interstitial tissue was present in all 10
biopsy samples and hypertrophy of the myocytes was seen
in 8. Structural disarray of varying degrees was found in 5
of the 8 patients with hypertrophy of the endomyocardial
myocardium (patients 1, 6, 10, 11, 12). Thickening of the
endocardium was present in the 4th and 12th patients (Fig 3).
Radioisotope Myocardial Perfusion Imaging
Of the 12 patients 11 did not have perfusion defects on
myocardial perfusion imaging at rest. The 12th patient had a
perfusion defect at the apex. Of the 3 patients with ST-T de￾pression during exercise, 2 underwent dipyridamole loaded
myocardial perfusion imaging and 1 had exercise myocar￾dial perfusion imaging and none had a perfusion defect.
BNP
BNP was measured in 8 patients at the time of diagnosis,
and was >200 pg/ml in all. BNP increased in 7 patients with
progression of cardiomegaly or pulmonary hypertension
during follow-up.
Medications
Diuretics were administered to 11 patients, and aspirin to
1 and warfarin to 2 patients as thrombolytic therapy. Other
drugs used included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi￾tors for 7; angiotensin II receptor blocker and -blocker for
1 patient each; digoxin for 2, and calcium-channel blocker
for 3 patients.
Prognosis
Two patients, aged 4 and 16 years, underwent orthotopic
heart transplantation outside Japan. One, patient no. 11, is
alive, but the other (patient no. 4) died of acute rejection.
Among the remaining 10 patients, 7 have died (Table 1). Of
the 7 deaths, 6 occurred within 4 years of onset; notably, 2
infants died within 2 years of diagnosis. The probability of
survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 78%, 52% and 26%, re￾spectively. The survival time in patients 5, 11 and 12 with
moderate LVH was 19 years, 5 years and 4 years, respec￾tively, and was prolonged compared with the remaining
patients without LVH (Table 1).
Four of the 7 deaths were sudden: patient no. 3 experi￾enced premonitory symptoms, including pallor and abdomi￾nal pain, and died 4 days later; patient no. 6 had had several
episodes of chest pain and complained of general malaise
and chest pain the day before his death – he died suddenly
while walking at school; patient no. 8 had had syncope at
school 3 years after onset of RCM symptoms and was
taken to school by car, but 8 months later, he died suddenly
during sleep; his parents had been worried about his pallor
for the few days before his death.
Three patients died of right heart failure: 1 had massive
ascites because of right heart failure with severe tricuspid
regurgitation; patient no. 5 had had a massive pericardial
effusion with ascites and edema of the lower extremities
with a history of cerebral infarction because of atrial fibril￾lation at the age of 11 years; patient no. 9 has worsening of
right heart failure had worsened with rapid progression of
pulmonary hypertension.
Discussion
One of the characteristic ECG abnormalities of RCM is
tall, biphasic P waves, indicating bilateral atrial enlarge￾ment.5 In the present series, another common feature was
narrow QRS complexes with ST-T segment abnormalities
that differed from the “strain pattern” seen in patients with
LVH and enlargement. Although the voltage of the QRS
waves in RCM is often high, they are narrow. The T wave is
often notched or biphasic,6 which was also true in our series.
Furthermore, most of the ST segments are obliquely ele￾vated and the peak of the T wave is late. These abnormali￾Fig 3. Fibrosis of the interstitial tissue in a representative endomyo￾cardium biopsy. (A) Thickening of the endocardium (×40; Masson

ties of the ST-T segments on 12-lead ECG are characteristic
for RCM, and these typical ST-T segments are especially
suspicious for RCM without LVH. Importantly, these
abnormalities may result in a prolonged QT interval. The
characteristic ST-T segments in idiopathic RCM reflect the
restrictive diastolic function and repolarization abnormali￾ties of the ventricular muscle.
In the present patients with RCM, death was either
sudden or caused by right heart failure; 2 died suddenly
during daily activities. A previous report has described ven￾tricular fibrillation inducing torsades de pointes in patients
with idiopathic RCM,7 and, based on the presence of ST-T
depression, those authors suggested a relationship between
sudden death and acute myocardial infarction in this con￾dition. However, we suspect that sudden death does not
necessarily relate to ischemia. In our series, 3 patients had
significant ST depression in all leads, except lead I, induced
by a Masters-double step test. CAG revealed normal coro￾nary arteries and no perfusion defects were present on either
exercise-loaded or dipyridamole-loaded myocardial per￾fusion imaging. The ST depression in these patients with
abnormal ST-T segments at rest is not necessarily related to
myocardial ischemia. It is also an ECG characteristic of pa￾tients with RCM. We speculate that sudden death in RCM
patients is caused by ventricular arrhythmias induced by
repolarization abnormalities of the ventricular muscle.
In the endomyocardial biopsy specimens from the right
ventricle, there was interstitial fibrosis in all 10 patients and
it was the only common finding in RCM. The degree of
hypertrophy of the myocardium varied, as in previously
reported.8,9 Disarray of the myocardial tissue was found 
in half of those with hypertrophy of the myocardium. The
histological features reflect the fact that there is no single
etiology of RCM and the pathologic process is not specific.
In our series, 3 patients had hypertrophy of the LV wall and
some patients with a hypertrophic ventricular wall and
RCM have been previously reported.1,8–10 In the recent
American Heart Association classification, RCM indicates
restrictive nonhypertrophied cardiomyopathy,11 but we be￾lieve that there is a second type of RCM in children, name￾ly, restrictive hypertrophied cardiomyopathy. Our 3 patients
with restrictive hypertrophied cardiomyopathy had a pro￾longed survival compared with the patients without LVH
(Table 1).
Our patients showed 3 presentations. First, cardiomegaly
with symptomatic heart failure in infancy; second, cardiac
murmur in young children; and third, abnormalities of the
ECG detected in school-aged children. RCM is a progressive
disease over several years and, especially in infants with
cardiomegaly, the clinical course is often rapid.2 In pediatric
RCM, the younger the patient is at the time of disease onset,
the shorter the survival time.
In the absence of effective treatment to improve the prog￾nosis of children with RCM, orthotopic heart transplanta￾tion is currently recommended.12–14 Determining its timing
is difficult, because idiopathic RCM is not a single disease
and the clinical course varies. Sudden death can occur in
stable patients without severe heart failure. BNP is elevated
in the stable condition, and worsens with right heart failure,
because of progression of pulmonary hypertension. The pro￾gression of the clinical course must be observed carefully,
especially progression of pulmonary hypertension.12,15 In
contrast with adults with RCM, frequent atrial arrhythmias
were not detected, except in patient no. 5 who had a long
survival. The potential problem of fatal arrhythmia in RCM
requires further investigation.
Conclusion
High-voltage narrow QRS complexes with obliquely
elevated ST-T segments and late peak T waves on 12-lead
ECG typify suspected RCM. These abnormalities of the ST￾T segments and T waves are important findings that indicate
abnormal ventricular muscle and may relate to sudden death
in these patients.
