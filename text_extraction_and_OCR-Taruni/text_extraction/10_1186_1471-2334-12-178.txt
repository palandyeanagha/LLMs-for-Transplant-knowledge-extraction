Abstract
Background: A national survey for chronic hepatitis C has not been performed in Denmark and the prevalence is
unknown. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C from public registers and the proportion
of these patients who received specialized healthcare.
Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C were identified from four national registers: a laboratory
register, the Hospital Discharge Register, a clinical database of chronic viral hepatitis and the Register of
Communicable Diseases. The total population diagnosed with hepatitis C was estimated by capture-recapture
analysis. The population with undiagnosed hepatitis C was derived from the national register of drug users by
comparing diagnosed and tested persons.
Results: A total of 6,935 patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C were identified in the four registers and the
estimated population diagnosed with the disease was 9,166 persons (95% C.I. interval 8,973 – 9,877), corresponding
to 0.21% (95% CI 0.21%-0.23%) of the Danish population over 15years of age. The prevalence was highest among
persons 40–49years old (0.39%) and males (0.28%). It was estimated that 40% of the diagnosed patients lived in the
capital region, and 33.5% had attended specialised healthcare. It was estimated that 46% of hepatitis C patients
had not been diagnosed and the total population with chronic hepatitis C in Denmark was 16,888 (95% C.I.
16,474-18,287), corresponding to 0.38% (95% CI 0.37-0.42) of the population over 15years of age.
Conclusions: The estimated prevalence of chronic hepatitis C in Denmark was 0.38%. Less than half of the patients
with chronic hepatitis C in Denmark have been identified and among these patients, one in three has attended
specialised care.
Background
Hepatitis C is not a common disease in Northern Eur￾ope, where most prevalence estimates in the general
population are below one percent [1-3]. Hepatitis C is a
blood borne viral infection, and in the Scandinavian
countries the large majority of patients have been
infected through drug injection. In Denmark 83% of
reported transmissions in 2007 were due to injecting
drug use and in Sweden 88% of 31,000 reported HCV
transmissions between 1990 and 2006 were due to
injecting drug use [4,5]. The reported prevalence of anti￾bodies against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) among Da￾nish injecting drug users was between 62% and 97% and
half of them became infected within a year after the first
injection [6-8].
Seroprevalence surveys of the general population are
the gold standard for assessing the number of HCV
infected within a country. This is time consuming and
costly to perform and have never been done in Den￾mark. As the country has a long tradition of public reg￾isters and all residents have a unique civil registration
number, the overlap between registers may be used to
estimate the unregistered “hidden” population by
capture-recapture analysis [9]. This type of analysis is
often hampered by dependence between registers, but by
using combinations of multiple sources interactions be￾tween registers may be identified and accounted for.
The primary aim of this study was to estimate the
population with diagnosed and undiagnosed hepatitis C
in Denmark by the use of national registers. Secondary

aims were to estimate the proportion of patients who
attended specialised clinical care and the coverage of the
national registers for diagnosed cases of hepatitis C.
Methods
Settings
As of 1 January 2008, Denmark had a population of 5.5
million inhabitants [10]. Testing for hepatitis C was
introduced in 1991 and medical care including treatment
for hepatitis C has always been tax-paid and provided
free-of-charge.
Data sources
We used the unique 10-digit civil registration number
assigned to all persons with permanent residence in
Denmark to link the data sources described below. Per￾sons without a valid civil registration number were
excluded from the analysis.
The estimate was based on four national source
registers:
Laboratory database (DANVIR): This research
database included all patients tested for hepatitis C in
14 of the 18 Danish laboratories performing HCV tests
(excluding blood donors). The laboratories contributing
to the database served an estimated 85% of the Danish
population and included data on 177,453 persons tested
for hepatitis C. Data were included from the initiation
of electronically stored test results used by all
laboratories from 2000 onwards. From this register we
included all subjects who had a positive HCV-RNA test
not followed by a negative HCV-RNA. Thus patients
who tested positive for anti-HCV, but had no HCV￾RNA reported, were not included in the analysis.
Hospital Register: This was established in January 1977
(inpatients) and recorded all discharge diagnoses
according to ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes, and since 1995
all hospital outpatient visits for patients treated in
Danish hospitals. The International Classification of
Diseases 8th revision was used until the end of 1993
and here after the 10th revision - ICD-9 was never
used in Denmark.
From this register we extracted all individuals
registered with chronic hepatitis C (ICD10 diagnosis
B18.2).
Hepatitis database (DANHEP): This national clinical
database contained all patients above 15 years of age
with chronic viral hepatitis who attended specialist care
in Denmark since 2002 regardless of the year of first
contact. In 2009 it contained 6,489 persons. The
database was updated once yearly and was complete as
of 31.12.2007, the time of extraction. From this
database we identified all patients with chronic
hepatitis C (HCV-RNA positive at inclusion).
Communicable Diseases Register: This is a national
public register of notifiable diseases and it contains
mandatory report forms from the diagnosing physician
of acute viral hepatitis C from 1991 and chronic
hepatitis C from May 2000. The register is estimated to
cover 35-40% of individuals diagnosed with chronic
hepatitis C and contained a total of 8,202 persons with
acute or chronic hepatitis B and C [11,12]. From this
register we included all patients reported with chronic
hepatitis C.
Except for the laboratory register it was not possible to
exclude patients who cleared the infection from the
source registers. However spontaneous clearance of
chronic HCV is less than 1%/year and in Denmark less
than 2% of those infected have been cured by
treatment [13,14].
In addition to the four source registers we extracted
data from:
Drug Treatment Register: This national register
included all persons treated for drug abuse in Denmark
since 1996 with detailed information of drug use, but
no information of viral hepatitis. This register was used
to estimate the population of drug users infected with
hepatitis C that had not been diagnosed.
The Civil Register: This register was established in
1968 and stored information on vital status, residency
as well as immigration and emigration on all Danish
residents. From this register we extracted vital status
and residency.
Study population
In the study we included all individuals, who could be
identified with chronic hepatitis C in one or more of the
above four source registers. In order to assure equal
chance of entrance into registers and to allow stratified
geographical analysis we excluded all persons who were
below 16years of age, had no assigned address or were
reported dead, missing or emigrated in the civil register
at 31.12.2007 Data were extracted from the above regis￾ters as of 31.12.2007.
We estimated the Danish population with chronic
hepatitis C in a two step procedure.
1) The population with diagnosed chronic hepatitis C
was calculated by capture-recapture analyses of the
overlap between the four source registers stratified
by gender, three age groups, five geographical
regions and two time periods. This was based on
log-linear modelling using the statistical program
GLIM 4 [9,15]. The final table contained 60 cells,
and in total 113 different models including all
possible two-way and three-way interactions were
fitted to the overlap data. We primarily used the
Akaike information criterion to select the ‘best’
Christensen et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12:178 Page 2 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/12/178

fitting model, however when this model produced
an estimate that differed markedly from the
weighted estimate (averaged across all fitted model
using the Schwartz criterion as a weight) then the
Schwartz criteria was used to obtain the best fitting
model. If there was discrepancy, or the choice
between the Akaike and Schwartz criteria was not
clear, then the model that produced an estimate
closest to the ratio of known to estimated found in
other strata was selected. Confidence intervals for
the total estimate were derived from boot-strap
analysis of 1000 samples [16,17].
2) The proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis C
that had not been diagnosed (never tested) was
calculated from the drug treatment register. The
number of diagnosed cases in the treatment register
was extracted from the four source registers and
increased by the estimated fraction of diagnosed
cases not present in these registers (the “hidden”
population) (Figure 1). We estimated the true
proportion of HCV infected drug users in the drug
treatment register as the proportion of HCVRNA
positives divided by all drug users who had been
tested for HCV. From this proportion we calculated
the total number of HCV infected in the register,
assuming the prevalence of hepatitis C was the same
among tested and non-tested drug users. The
diagnosed fraction in the drug treatment register
was hereafter calculated as the estimated number of
diagnosed patients divided by the estimated total
number of hepatitis C patients in the register.
Assuming the same proportion of diagnosed
hepatitis C infection outside the treatment register
we calculated the total prevalence of hepatitis C in
Denmark from the capture-recapture estimate of
diagnosed hepatitis C and the estimated coverage
rate (Figure 1). A further boot-strap analysis, which
also included a binomial distribution to account for
the coverage rate, was used to obtain a 95%
confidence interval of the total prevalence.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v. 18.0.
The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection
Agency (J. 2008-41-2402).
Results
Estimate of population diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C
The initial extraction from the four source registers
identified 9,315 individuals diagnosed with hepatitis C.
We excluded 2,380 persons (25.5%) of whom 88% had
died, 11% had unknown vital status (emigrants and miss￾ing persons), 1% were below 16years of age and 0.3%
had unknown address. The remaining 6,935 cases were
included in the capture recapture analysis (Table 1).
Of the included cases 65% were men, but the propor￾tion of men was lower in the clinical registers (hospital
register and hepatitis database). These two registers also
had a higher proportion of older people and a lower per￾centage of persons who had received treatment for drug
use. In all registers most cases were included after the

year 2000, and the geographical distribution was fairly
constant between registers (Table 1).
The total estimate of persons alive with a diagnosis
of hepatitis C was 9,166 cases (95% confidence interval
8,973 – 9,877) with a hidden population of 2,231
(24%) – these were individuals diagnosed with chronic
hepatitis C but not identified in any of the source reg￾isters (Table 2). The estimate corresponded to 0.21%
(95% C.I. 0.206%-0.226%) of the Danish population
above 15years. The prevalence was highest amongst
40–49 year olds (0.39%), and was twice as high among
men as among women (0.28% versus 0.14%). The
regional prevalence ranged from 0.15% in the North
region to 0.28% in Copenhagen, and the capital region
represented 40% of all diagnosed cases. In all regions
the age distribution changed over calendar time so
that patients at inclusion were younger after 2000.
The proportion of diagnosed cases present in each
register varied from 31% in the communicable disease
register to 49% in the hospital register, and 33.5% (3065/
9166) had attended specialised clinical care (present in
the hepatitis database DANHEP) (Table 1).
The stratified analyses covered 60 strata and the best
models fitted to the stratified overlap patterns contained

an average of two significant interactions between the
four source registers. The most frequent interaction was
between the hospital register and the communicable dis￾eases register, and the hospital register and the clinical
register; these were both found in more than half of the
strata, whereas an interaction between the communic￾able disease and clinical registers was not found to be
significant in any strata. By the inclusion of interaction
terms the total estimate of patients with the hepatitis C
diagnose increased from 7,012 to 9,166 patients.
Estimate of the undiagnosed population with chronic
hepatitis C
Among individuals alive and registered in the national
drug treatment register, 33.1% (7,821/23,657) had a
recorded test for anti-HCV and/or HCV-RNA in the la￾boratory register; 29.3% (2,293/7,821) had chronic hepa￾titis C (HCV-RNA positive), 15.3% (1,196) had past
hepatitis C (anti-HCV positive and HCV-RNA negative),
38.1% (2,983) were unexposed (anti-HCV negative) and
17.3% (1,349) were anti-HCV positive, but had no
recorded test result for HCV-RNA. In the laboratory
register among all Danish patients with a positive anti￾HCV and a test result for HCV-RNA, 62.2% (3,999/
6,431; 95% CI 61.0-63.4%) were positive - indicating that
2/3 of Danish patients exposed to hepatitis C had devel￾oped chronic infection. Assuming that 62.2% (839/1,349)
of anti-HCV positives in the drug treatment register not
tested for HCV-RNA to be positive, the total prevalence
of chronic hepatitis C among all tested drug users in the
treatment register was 40.0% (3,132/7,821) (Figure 1). If
40% of the non-tested drug users in the register were
also HCV-RNA positives, the total HCV-RNA positive
population in the drug treatment register corresponded
to 9,463 persons. The tested population was older (me￾dian age 40years/32years, p<0.001) and had a higher
proportion of women (52% versus 40% p<0.001) than
the not tested population. Drug users with hepatitis C
were significantly older (43year/38years, p<0.001)
whereas no gender difference was observed compared to
drug users who did not have chronic hepatitis C.
In the drug treatment register 3,886 (16.4% of
23,657) had a diagnosis of hepatitis C in one or more
of the four source registers (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Adding the 24% unregistered cases (the hidden popula￾tion derived from the national capture-recapture calcu￾lation) the total number of diagnosed cases increased
to 5,136 (or 21.7% of 23,657) in the drug treatment
register. Compared to the total of 9,463 patients with
chronic hepatitis C estimated to be present in the drug
treatment register, these 5,136 diagnosed cases repre￾sented 54.3% (95% CI 53.2%-55.3%).
We assumed the same diagnostic coverage (54.3%)
among hepatitis C patients outside the drug treatment
register. Including the 45.7% undiagnosed infections in
the national estimate of hepatitis C, this rose from 9,166
to 16,888 (95% C.I. 16,474- 18,287), corresponding to a
prevalence of chronic hepatitis C in Denmark of 0.38%
(95% CI 0.37-0.42) of the population >15years of age.
Fifteen per cent of reported HCV transmissions in
Denmark were not drug related, mostly nosocomial
transmissions, and among these the diagnostic coverage
may be different. Therefore we compared our estimates
with a cohort of hepatitis C patients infected by blood
transfusion and identified in the Danish hepatitis C
look-back study [18]. Among 124 patients with diag￾nosed hepatitis C transmitted by transfusion 17% were
not present in our source registers (compared to 24% in
our estimate) and among a total of 187 recipients pos￾sibly infected (including 63 not tested) the four source
registers identified 55% in agreement with the 54% esti￾mate from the drug treatment register) (S Just, personal
communication).
Excluded populations
We excluded 749 patients from the laboratory register
as they were initially HCV-RNA positive but later be￾came negative. However, 564 of these were registered
with chronic hepatitis C in one or more of the other
registers – most likely representing resolved or cured
infections, but reinfection was also possible and there￾fore they were kept in the analysis. Excluding these 564
individuals did not influence the estimate significantly
(data not shown). We additionally excluded 4,928 per￾sons who were positive for anti-HCV but never tested
for HCV-RNA in the laboratory register. Including these
persons from the laboratory register, as well as patients
reported with acute hepatitis C (corresponding to all
persons ever exposed to HCV) gave an estimate of
13,184 diagnosed cases. Assuming that only 62% of the
added cases were chronic infections (HCV-RNA posi￾tives) the diagnosed population was 11,657, and cor￾rected for undiagnosed patients, this corresponded to a
total of 21,468 patients living with chronic hepatitis C in
Denmark (0.49% of the adult population).
Discussion
In this large register based capture-recapture analysis we
estimated the population living with a diagnosis of
chronic hepatitis C in Denmark to be 0.21% of the popu￾lation. Including undiagnosed patients the total estimate
of patients with chronic hepatitis C corresponded to
0.38% of the adult population. The higher prevalence
among men, persons 40–49years of age and residents in
the capital region was in agreement with previous popu￾lation surveys and the geographic distribution of hepa￾titis C infected Danish blood donors [3,18,19]. The
South region had the highest proportion of young men.
Christensen et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12:178 Page 5 of 8

Here systematic screening for hepatitis C had been per￾formed amongst drug users since 1996. The clinical reg￾isters (hospital discharge register and the hepatitis
database) had a lower prevalence of persons <40years of
age, males and drug users in the treatment register. This
could indicate that these groups had less clinical illness
due to hepatitis C, or that young males were less likely
to seek clinical care for hepatitis C. The latter explan￾ation is in agreement with a recent Danish survey
reporting that drug users diagnosed with clinically sig￾nificant chronic hepatitis C were unlikely to enter hos￾pital based clinical care [20]. It was surprising to us that
only about a third of patients diagnosed with chronic
hepatitis C attended specialised clinical care. With the
improved therapies becoming available for hepatitis C
these years, we suggest that new strategies must be
developed in order to assure all patients with hepatitis C
have proper care, once the disease has been diagnosed
[21]. It was also unexpected that half of all patients were
not present in the laboratory register as the hepatitis C
diagnosis cannot be made without a positive HCVRNA
test. There may be several explanations for this: HCV
tests became available in 1991–2, but most laboratories
did not import old test results when testing was compu￾terised in the late nineties and we had only access to
electronic test result. In addition, the participating la￾boratories only covered 85% of the Danish population.
Our study had several limitations: Capture-recapture
analysis requires a closed study population and the same
case definition in all registers. To fulfil this we excluded
patients who died, and extracted data from all registers
at the same day (31.12.2007), but we could not identify
patients who cleared chronic hepatitis C, either spontan￾eously or by treatment except in the laboratory register.
Spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C after development
of chronic infection is rare and it is estimated that only
2% of hepatitis C patients in Denmark have been treated
[13,14]. This bias could lead to overestimation of the
hidden population. As for the case definition this may
have changed over time. In the early nineties the clinical
diagnosis had in some cases been based on positive anti￾HCV (and elevated liver enzymes) in the communicable
disease and hospital register. In contrast all cases in the
laboratory and the hepatitis database (DANVIR and
DANHEP) were based on positive HCV-RNA. Further￾more 9% of patients in the hepatitis database had cleared
hepatitis C as a result of treatment [22]. With different
case definitions between registers, the hidden population
will be over estimated. On the other side, we excluded
4,928 anti-HCV positive persons from the laboratory
register as these had no available HCV-RNA test, but it
is likely that 62.2% (3064 patients 95%CI 3006–3124) of
this group had chronic HCV infection. Our register esti￾mate is lower than the general population estimates
from Scandinavia, so most likely the bias mentioned let
to an underestimation of the HCV infected population
[2].
Another limitation was that the capture-recapture
method only estimated the number of patients diag￾nosed with hepatitis C and not the population that had
never been tested for HCV. A direct estimate would re￾quire a general population survey which had not been
performed in Denmark. Instead, we estimated the test
coverage within the population of hepatitis C infected in
the drug treatment register and applied this (46% un￾diagnosed) to calculate the total population with chronic
hepatitis C in Denmark. If the prevalence of hepatitis C
was lower among the drug users who had not been
tested, this could overestimate the hepatitis C popula￾tion. As the drug users that had not been tested for
hepatitis C were younger such a bias would be expected
but an independent population survey, performed in
2007 among drug users in treatment in the county of
Funen, found a 40% hepatitis C prevalence, very similar
to what we estimated from the national drug treatment
register [7]. Furthermore the hepatitis C prevalence
among tested ever and never injectors in the treatment
register were identical to the survey results (53% and
5%) giving further credibility to our estimate. An explan￾ation of why an age difference did not correspond to a
difference in hepatitis C prevalence could be that drug
users becomes infected very rapidly after start of injec￾tion (50% within the first year) but on average do not
enter treatment until after 4years of drug use and there￾fore the age difference is of less importance [7].
Another independent source was a national survey
from 2004–2008, among 1009 drug related deaths, who
were tested post mortem for hepatitis C. Their age and
gender distribution was comparable to the drug treat￾ment register (median age 38 years and 22% were fe￾male) and the estimated prevalence of chronic hepatitis
C was 35% - slightly lower than our 40% treatment
register estimate [23,24]. If the true hepatitis C preva￾lence was 35% in the treatment register, 62% would have
been identified and the corresponding national estimate
of hepatitis C infected would decline to 14,783 (0.34% of
the adult population).
The estimates of test coverage for hepatitis C (54%
and 62%) among drug users in Denmark used two differ￾ent methods but both were higher than a 42% test cover￾age reported among drug users in Scotland, suggesting
that our national hepatitis C prevalence estimates could
be too low [25].
Another limitation in the above calculations was that
we assumed the same test coverage among hepatitis C
patients outside the drug treatment register (former and
never injectors). We found practically the same diagnos￾tic coverage for a cohort of never injectors (patients

infected by blood transfusion), but a cohort of former
drug injectors could not be identified.
A comparable hepatitis C estimate from England and
Wales (using multiple surveys, register data and math￾ematical modelling) found that former injectors consti￾tuted 47%, current injectors 38% and never-injectors
15% of the total British hepatitis C estimate (0.60% of
the adult population) [26,27]. Corresponding Danish
estimates were 15-17% never users and 41% current
injectors, deducing that former injectors may constitute
43% of the hepatitis C population [4,28,29]. A large pro￾portion of former injectors with unknown but presum￾ably low test coverage would make our estimate more
uncertain and most likely too low. Our estimate was also
lower than reported from two general population sur￾veys from Sweden and Norway, both reporting an anti￾HCV prevalence of 0.7% (corresponding to 0.45% and
0.5% with chronic hepatitis C infection) in the general
population [2,30]. If the true Danish prevalence of hepa￾titis C infection was 0.45% (corresponding to 19,645
patients), and our estimate was too low due to lower test
coverage among infected former drug users, these would
constitute 51% of the estimate (10,050) and the diag￾nosed proportion with hepatitis C amongst former injec￾tors would be 39% (3948).
Conclusions
In conclusion we estimated the prevalence of chronic
hepatitis C in the adult Danish population to be 0.38%,
but due to bias and random variation the true preva￾lence could be within 0,34% - 0,49%. Of all patients with
hepatitis C only half have been diagnosed and one third
of the diagnosed attended specialised clinical care. This
suggests that screening for hepatitis C should be
improved and that new strategies are needed in order to
deliver appropriate clinical care to the hepatitis C
infected population. This will be of increasing import￾ance as the treatment for hepatitis C continues to
improve.
