Introduction
The autonomic nervous system plays a critical role in the genesis and maintenance of ventricular tachyar￾rhythmias (VT) (1, 2). In particular, sympathetic activation and parasympathetic dysfunction are known to 
accompany myocardial infarction (MI) and increase the risk of sudden cardiac death (1, 2). Parasympathet￾ic dysfunction has been indirectly studied and manifests as abnormal baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate 
variability in cardiomyopathy patients (3–6). Mechanisms behind these abnormalities — and importantly, 
the level at which they occur (cardiac vs. extracardiac) — are poorly characterized. Multiple studies have 
shown that vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces inflammation and ischemia-driven ventricular arrhyth￾mias if initiated at the time of or before onset of coronary artery occlusion (7–10). However, introducing 
VNS before or even at the onset of ischemia is not clinically feasible. Furthermore, many gaps exist in our 
knowledge regarding vagal control of cardiac excitability, parasympathetic neural control and remodeling, 
and alterations in cardiac parasympathetic neurotransmitters with MI. Therefore, it is unknown if VNS 
can reduce recurrent VT in the setting of a chronic MI when pathological myocardial remodeling with scar 
formation and neural remodeling has occurred. It is also unknown if VNS can be used acutely for treat￾ment of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) storm in patients with cardiomyopathy. 
Myocardial infarction causes sympathetic activation and parasympathetic dysfunction, 
which increase risk of sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Mechanisms underlying 
parasympathetic dysfunction are unclear. The aim of this study was to delineate consequences of 
myocardial infarction on parasympathetic myocardial neurotransmitter levels and the function of 
parasympathetic cardiac ganglia neurons, and to assess electrophysiological effects of vagal nerve 
stimulation on ventricular arrhythmias in a chronic porcine infarct model. While norepinephrine 
levels decreased, cardiac acetylcholine levels remained preserved in border zones and viable 
myocardium of infarcted hearts. In vivo neuronal recordings demonstrated abnormalities in firing 
frequency of parasympathetic neurons of infarcted animals. Neurons that were activated by 
parasympathetic stimulation had low basal firing frequency, while neurons that were suppressed 
by left vagal nerve stimulation had abnormally high basal activity. Myocardial infarction 
increased sympathetic inputs to parasympathetic convergent neurons. However, the underlying 
parasympathetic cardiac neuronal network remained intact. Augmenting parasympathetic 
drive with vagal nerve stimulation reduced ventricular arrhythmia inducibility by decreasing 
ventricular excitability and heterogeneity of repolarization of infarct border zones, an area with 
known proarrhythmic potential. Preserved acetylcholine levels and intact parasympathetic 
neuronal pathways can explain the electrical stabilization of infarct border zones with vagal nerve 
stimulation, providing insight into its antiarrhythmic benefit.

Implications of this therapy are critical for the many patients with heart failure who experience recurrent 
internal, cardiac defibrillator shocks due to VT, despite catheter ablation and medical therapies (11–13).
In this study, we hypothesized that MI causes a decrease in parasympathetic drive from the CNS. As 
evidence for this, we hypothesized that the primary parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) 
would remain intact in the setting of MI, but that parasympathetic neurons in the intrinsic cardiac ganglia 
(on the surface heart) would demonstrate abnormal activity due to a decrease in central drive. Furthermore, 
we hypothesized that increasing this drive with VNS could acutely restore electrical stability by modu￾lating cardiac excitability and repolarization, a mechanism that, unlike previously described cellular and 
anti-inflammatory effects of VNS, could work rapidly to reduce arrhythmia burden. We investigated these 
questions in a porcine infarct model, utilizing neurotransmitter measurements, direct neuronal recordings, 
and electrophysiological mapping.
Results
Neurotransmitter analysis. Six to 8 weeks after percutaneous MI (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental 
material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.86715DS1), myocardial 
ACh and norepinephrine (NE) content from scar, border zone, and viable regions of infarcted hearts was 
analyzed, guided by electronatomic bipolar voltage mapping prior to sampling of each of these regions 
(Figure 1A). In addition, in normal animals, ACh and NE levels across the left ventricular (LV) apex, 
anterior, and lateral walls were also analyzed and compared with infarcted hearts. There was no signifi￾cant difference in ACh levels across the LV epicardium, including LV apex, anterior, and lateral walls of 
normal hearts (Figure 1B). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between ACh content of the 
epicardium and endocardium of normal animals (Figure 1C). In infarcted hearts, regional ACh analysis 
demonstrated that scar regions (with voltage < 0.5 mV) had the lowest ACh levels as compared with bor￾der zone and viable myocardium (Figure 1D, P ≤ 0.01). Although ACh content of scar areas was, to some 
extent, reduced compared with normal hearts, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.1). 
Therefore, cardiac ACh levels in infarcted animals, particularly in border zone and viable myocardium, 
were unchanged compared with normal animals.
Similar to ACh, NE levels were similar across the LV epicardium (LV apex, LV anterior wall, and LV 
lateral wall), as well as on the epicardium, compared with the endocardium of normal hearts (Figure 1, E 
and F). However, unlike ACh, NE content in scar regions was significantly reduced compared with normal 
hearts (Figure 1G). In infarcted hearts, NE levels of viable myocardium remained relatively normal and 
greater than border zone regions. Scar demonstrated the lowest NE content (Figure 1G).
MI alters basal activity of parasympathetic neurons. Given that ACh levels in infarcted hearts were main￾tained, basal activity of parasympathetic neurons of the cardiac ganglia was then evaluated to discern dif￾ferences in the firing frequency of these neurons between normal and infarcted animals. The ventral inter￾ventricular (VIV) fat pad, located below the left atrial appendage in the porcine heart (Supplemental Figure 
1), contains multiple ganglia that innervate the ventricular myocardium. In vivo recordings from these 
neurons were obtained using a multielectrode array. An increase (Figure 2) or decrease (Figure 3) in firing 
frequency of a recorded neuron in response to right or left VNS was used to classify it as a parasympathetic 
efferent neuron (14). Basal activity of neurons that increased their firing frequency in response to left VNS 
was reduced in infarcted compared with normal animals (0.14 ± 0.04 Hz vs. 0.29 ± 0.07 Hz, respectively, P
< 0.05; Figure 2C). Furthermore, the basal activity of neurons that decrease their firing in response to left 
VNS was increased in infarcted compared with animals with normal hearts (0.56 ± 0.14 Hz vs. 0.31 ± 0.05 
Hz, respectively, P < 0.05; Figure 3C). No significant difference in basal activity of neurons that increase 
or decrease their firing frequency to right VNS was found (Figure 2D and Figure 3D). Therefore, neurons 
receiving inputs from the left vagal trunk demonstrated abnormal activity at baseline in infarcted compared 
with normal hearts, suggesting a decrease in central drive through the left vagus.
Cardiac parasympathetic neuronal function. We then further classified parasympathetic neurons in the car￾diac ganglia as purely efferent or convergent in order to assess if MI caused remodeling of the type of 
inputs these neurons received. A parasympathetic neuron (classified by its response to right or left VNS) 
that also responded to an afferent stimulus, including epicardial mechanosensory stimuli and/or changes 
in preload and afterload, was further classified as a convergent parasympathetic neuron. Convergent neu￾rons are thought to be responsible for the majority of local cardiac neural processing (14, 15). A neuron 
that did not respond to afferent stimuli was classified as an efferent neuron. In this study, the proportion of

to identify viable, border zone, and scar regions. Examples of bipolar electrical recordings from viable, border zone, and scar regions are shown. Examples 
of uinpolar electrograms obtained from similar regions are also shown. This map and bipolar voltage measurements were used to obtain samples for neu￾rotransmitter analysis from appropriate locations. The scale bar shows the voltage from 0–10 mV. (B) In normal hearts (n = 12 normal animals, 3 samples 
per animal), acetylcholine (ACh) levels were not significantly different on the LV apex, anterior, lateral walls (linear mixed effects model). (C) ACh levels 
from paired LV epicardium and endocardium samples were also not significantly different (n = 9 normal animals, 2–3 samples per animal). (D) In infarcted 
hearts (n = 14), scar regions have the lowest ACh content compared with viable and border zone regions (P < 0.01, linear mixed effects model, 1–3 samples 
per region per animal). However, ACh content between viable and border zone regions of infarcted animals (n = 14) compared with similar regions of 
normal hearts (n = 15 animals) was not statistically significant (P = 0.4, linear mixed effects model). There is a suggestion that scar ACh may be somewhat 
reduced compared with normal hearts; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. (E) Similar to ACh levels, there was no difference in 
norepinephrine (NE) content across the LV apex, anterior, or lateral wall (linear mixed effects model, n = 12 normal animals, 3 samples per animal). (F) Also, 
similar to ACh, NE levels in the endocardium were similar to epicardium (linear mixed effects model, n = 9 animals, 2–3 samples per animal). (G) Unlike 
ACh, the NE content in scar and border zone regions was significantly reduced compared with viable myocardium in infarcted hearts (P < 0.05 for border 
zone vs. viable, and P < 0.01 for scar vs. viable, linear mixed effects model, n = 5 animals, 1–3 samples per region per animal) and was significantly less 
than similar regions in normal hearts (P < 0.01, linear mixed effects model). There was no difference in NE content of viable regions of infarcted hearts 
compared with normal hearts. MI, myocardial infarction; EGM, myocardial electrogram; LV, left ventricle; Epi, epicardium; Endo, endocardium.

convergent neurons was unchanged in infarcted 
compared with normal hearts (81% of total neu￾rons responding to left VNS were convergent in 
normal vs. 79% in infarcted hearts, P = 0.8; 82% 
of total neurons responding to right VNS were 
convergent in normal vs. 82% in infarcted hearts, 
P = 0.9). We then evaluated if the amount of 
sympathetic input received by these convergent 
neurons was altered due to MI. Therefore, the 
activity of parasympathetic convergent neurons 
in response to right or left stellate stimulation 
was assessed. The proportion of convergent 
parasympathetic neurons that also received 
sympathetic input from the right or left stellate 
ganglion (e.g., responded to right or left stellate 
ganglion stimulation) was significantly increased 
in infarcted compared with normal hearts (25% of left vagal convergent neurons received sympathetic input 
in normal vs. 51% in infarcted hearts, P < 0.01; and 25% of right vagal convergent neurons received sympa￾thetic input in normal vs. 56% in infarcted hearts, P < 0.01; Figure 4, A and B). There was no difference in 
the proportion of purely efferent parasympathetic neurons that also received sympathetic input in infarcted 
vs. normal hearts (Figure 4).
Conditional probability analysis demonstrated that the functional connectivity or the primary relation￾ships of parasympathetic neurons in the cardiac ganglia remained intact in infarcted hearts (Figure 4, C and 
E). However, there was increasing sympathetic input to convergent parasympathetic neurons, particularly 
those that received right ventricle (RV) sensory afferent input and transduced a decrease in preload (Figure 
4, C and E). Despite increased sympathetic neurotransmission and changes in the basal activity of neu￾rons receiving left vagal input, the underlying parasympathetic network at the level of the cardiac ganglia 
remained intact in infarcted hearts, suggesting that increasing central drive with VNS could still take advan￾tage of these remaining pathways in infarcted hearts to promote electrical stability (Figure 4, D and F).

injury. Given that central parasympathetic drive to the cardiac ganglia appeared to be reduced in infarcted 
hearts, while the underlying parasympathetic pathways and overall percentage of convergent and efferent 
neurons were intact, we hypothesized that restoring central drive with VNS could improve electrical sta￾bility, particularly in the absence of significant alterations in ACh levels. There was no difference in the

from 86 ± 3.8 bpm to 71 ± 2.5 bpm, systolic blood pressure from 123 ± 6.5 mmHg to 113 ± 7.1 mmHg, 
and diastolic blood pressure from 92 ± 5 mmHg to 79 ± 6 mmHg in normal animals (P < 0.001 for all 
parameters). Global epicardial ARI obtained from unipolar electrograms (Figure 5A) increased from 336 
± 13 ms to 354 ± 15 ms (Figure 5B, 5.4% ± 1%, P = 0.035) in normal hearts.
In infarcted animals, VNS decreased heart rate from 84 ± 3 bpm to 70 ± 3 bpm, systolic blood pressure 
from 112 ± 6 mmHg to 99 ± 6 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure from 99 ± 6 mmHg to 65 ± 4 mmHg 
(P < 0.001 for all parameters compared with baseline). Global epicardial ARI increased from 361 ± 13 ms 
to 405 ± 12 ms (13% ± 2%, P < 0.001; Figure 5C). The percentage change in global ARI in infarcted hearts 
was greater than in normal hearts (P = 0.035), despite similar stimulation currents.
In infarcted hearts, the scar regions had the greatest ARI at baseline (397 ± 14 ms) as compared with 
border zone (380 ± 14 ms) or viable myocardium (363 ± 14 ms; P < 0.01, Figure 5D). VNS significantly 
increased ARI in all regions (scar by 9.7 ± 11%, border zones by 14 ± 3.5%, and viable myocardium by 
12 ± 3%, P < 0.001 compared with baseline); however, border zone and viable regions showed a greater 
increase in ARI than scar regions (P < 0.05, Figure 5D). Given that scar regions had a higher ARI at base￾line, VNS led to an overall reduction in global epicardial heterogeneity in ARIs.
VT inducibility was assessed in 21 infarcted animals by ventricular extrastimulus pacing at baseline 
and during VNS (Figure 6A). Twelve (57%) of 21 infarcted animals were inducible for VT that required 
defibrillation at baseline (Figure 6B). Activation maps demonstrated significant areas of slowed con￾duction along border zones during VT (Figure 6C). During intermittent VNS, only 5 of 21 (23%) of 
infarcted animals were inducible (Figure 6B). There was one animal, however, that was not inducible 
at baseline and was inducible with triple extrastimuli during VNS. Overall, VNS significantly decreased 
inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias by 60% (P < 0.05).
Given reduction in VT inducibility, the dispersion in ARI or heterogeneity in repolarization in var￾ious regions of the infarcted myocardium was analyzed. At baseline, border zone regions showed the 
greatest dispersion in ARI 387 ± 12 ms2
 compared with scar (73 ± 23 ms2
) and viable (160 ± 25 ms2
) 
myocardium (Figure 6D), and they were often sites of VT exit and slowed conduction (Figure 6C). 
During VNS, ARI dispersion of border zone regions decreased to 185 ± 63 ms2
 (P < 0.05; Figure 6E). 
Scar regions did not show a significant change in dispersion during VNS (from 73 ± 23 ms2
 to 69 ± 26 
ms2
), while there was suggestion of a mild increase in dispersion in viable regions from 160 ± 25 ms2
 to 
253 ± 188 ms2
 (P = 0.1; Figure 6E).
Delineation of scar: electroanatomic mapping, cardiac MRI, and histology. In all infarcted hearts, epicar￾dial scar location on cardiac MRI was similar to low-voltage regions delineated by electroanatomic 
mapping (Figure 7). High-resolution cardiac MRI demonstrated areas of normal myocardium within 
regions of delayed enhancement that had recorded a voltage less than 0.5 mV (Figure 7), indicating 
that scar regions contained islands of viable myocardium, a finding that has been confirmed in patients 
Figure 4. Classification and relationships of parasympathetic neurons in normal and infarcted hearts. (A) Functional classification of parasympathet￾ic neurons that receive inputs from the left or right vagus is shown in normal hearts. Overall, percentage of convergent parasympathetic neurons that 
responded to left VNS and at least 1 afferent stimulus (therefore classified as convergent) was 81% (109 of 135 left VNS responsive neurons from 15 normal 
animals), and the percentage of convergent neurons that responded to right VNS was 82% (109 of 133 right VNS responsive neurons from 15 normal 
animals). Of these convergent neurons, approximately 30% also received sympathetic input in normal hearts. (B) Type of parasympathetic neurons that 
receive input from the left or right vagus is shown in hearts with myocardial infarction (MI). Percentage of convergent neurons that responded to left VNS 
was 79% (42 of 53 left VNS responsive neurons from 10 infarcted animals), and percentage of convergent neurons that responded to right VNS was 82% 
(41 of 50 total neurons from 10 infarcted animals). These values were not different than normal hearts (P = 0.8, χ2
 test). However, percentage of conver￾gent neurons also receiving sympathetic input was significantly increased in infarcted (n = 15 animals) compared with normal hearts (n = 10 animals), 
representing 65% (27 of 47 convergent neurons) and 68% (28 of 50 convergent neurons) for left and right VNS in infarcted animals, respectively, compared 
with 31% (34 of 109 convergent neurons) and 30% (33 of 109 convergent neurons) for left and right VNS in normal hearts, respectively (P < 0.05, χ2
 test).

with ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous characterization of this porcine model (16–19). In addi￾tion, in the 5 infarcted hearts from which samples of scar, border zone, and normal myocardium were 
obtained, islands of viable myocardium were evident within fibrotic areas designated as scar, likely 
giving rise to the electrical recordings observed in these regions (Figure 7).

all regions, even scar, demonstrate a significant increase in mean ARI from baseline (*P < 0.01, linear mixed effects model, n = 18 infarcted animals). 
Furthermore, when the percentage increase in ARI with VNS is compared across various regions of infarcted hearts, consistent with the ACh findings, scar 
shows the least response compared with viable and border zone regions (§

Discussion
MI causes diminished central parasympathetic drive, as evidenced by direct neuronal recordings in vivo and 
neurotransmitter measurements in infarcted and normal hearts. We show for the first time to our knowl￾edge that augmenting this drive with VNS reduces VT inducibility, even acutely, in chronic infarcted hearts. 
Furthermore, a mechanism for the antiarrhythmic benefit of VNS is electrical stabilization of infarct border 
zones, with reduced regional excitability and decreased heterogeneity in action potential duration. Acute 
electrical stabilization by VNS likely takes advantage of preserved cardiac ACh levels and an intact parasym￾pathetic cardiac neuronal network.
In this study, ACh levels in infarcted hearts were preserved 6–8 weeks after MI, while the input 
— particularly from the left vagal trunk — to the parasympathetic neurons in the VIV ganglia was 
reduced. Although the total proportion of convergent and efferent parasympathetic neurons — as 
well as the primary relationships of these neurons — remained intact, there was increasing sympa￾thetic input to convergent parasympathetic neurons, providing evidence for increased sympathetic 
drive coupled with lack of parasympathetic drive. Importantly, restoring central drive via VNS acutely 
reduced VT inducibility in the setting of chronic infarction, a finding that has important implications 
for patients with cardiomyopathy and recurrent VT and electrical storm. Finally, a mechanism for

An example of VT/VF induction using 
extrastimulus pacing from the RV 
endocardium is shown. Prior to VNS, this 
infarcted animal was inducible for VT, 
which degenerated into VF and required 
defibrillation. During intermittent VNS, 
VT/VF was no longer inducible with triple 
extrastimuli, and effective refractory 
period was reached. (B) Intermittent VNS 
significantly reduced the proportion of 
animals that were inducible for VT (n = 
21 infarcted, P = 0.04, McNemar’s test). 
(C) Epicardial activation map during VT 
in an infarcted animal that was inducible 
at baseline shows significant area of 
slowed conduction (multiple contours,

meeting “late activation” along the 
anterolateral border zone, likely contrib￾uting to reentry. (D) The dispersion in 
ARI at baseline and during VNS is shown 
across scar, border zone, and viable 
regions in infarcted hearts. Regional 
analysis showed that the dispersion in 
ARI in border zone regions was greater 
than scar regions (P < 0.05, linear mixed

at baseline. (E) Intermittent VNS signifi￾cantly reduced the dispersion in ARI of

the acute benefit of VNS is suggested by the decrease in dispersion of repolarization of border zone 
regions, reducing risk of reentry.
Mechanisms of parasympathetic dysfunction. The mechanisms behind parasympathetic dysfunction and 
increased risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with cardiomyopathy are not clear. In patients with 
heart failure, abnormal heart rate variability and baroreceptor sensitivity exist and increase risk of sudden 
death (3–6), but it is unknown which factors (cardiac neurotransmitters, thoracic and cardiac ganglia neural 
remodeling, or the CNS) are the primary drivers of parasympathetic dysfunction. The vago-sympathetic 
trunk, the primary highway of the parasympathetic nervous system, carries preganglionic cardiomotor

the surface of the heart. The cardiac ganglia are an important processing center for the heart, responding 
to beat-by-beat changes in mechanoelectrical function (14, 20, 21). Parasympathetic neurons within these 
ganglia send postganglionic projections to atrial and ventricular myocardium, which release ACh. Unlike 
NE levels — which were clearly reduced in scar and border zone regions, confirming previous studies 
demonstrating lack of sympathetic response in certain scar areas and abnormal remodeling of sympathet￾ic nerves along border zones regions (22–24) — ACh levels in infarcted hearts remained predominantly 
intact. In particular, there was no reduction in ACh levels along border zone regions. This data suggested 
that ACh is available for release, if central parasympathetic drive is restored.
Cardiac ganglia neurons of infarcted hearts respond abnormally to cardiac interventions, such as a 
decrease in preload (15). In this study, basal activity of parasympathetic neurons in the VIV ganglia was 
altered by MI. In particular, alterations in activity of neurons receiving left vagal input were observed. This 
laterality may be due to the ganglia used for recordings or location of the infarct (which primarily involved 
the LV). Multiple ganglia innervate the ventricular myocardium, and it is possible that if neural activity had 
been recorded from the dorsal ventricular fat pad, abnormal responses to right VNS may have been noted. 
Given the infarct location, it’s also possible that afferent signaling to the brainstem — especially the left 
nucleus tractus solitarius, which provides input to the left nucleus ambiguus and left dorsal motor nucleus 
of the vagus — is altered and leads to a reduction of parasympathetic drive through the left vagal trunk 
(25–27). However, both vagal trunks are needed to maintain normal parasympathetic tone, and transection 
of one trunk can have significant electrophysiological consequences in porcine and canine hearts (28, 29). 
Therefore, decreased parasympathetic outflow through the left vagus can have profound effects on the ven￾tricular myocardium, particularly in the infarcted region.
An evaluation of the type of parasympathetic neurons within the cardiac ganglia revealed that the 
total number of convergent parasympathetic neurons was unchanged between normal and infarcted 
hearts, and the primary underlying relationships of these neurons remained intact. However, the propor￾tion of convergent neurons that would normally receive only parasympathetic input decreased, and the 
proportion receiving sympathetic input increased. These findings provide important insight into the neu￾ral remodeling that occurs with MI, with evidence for sympathetic activation and central parasympathetic 
withdrawal at the level of the cardiac ganglia. Furthermore, these observations begin to explain the ben￾eficial effects of VNS in the setting of chronic MI, as increasing central parasympathetic drive can utilize 
the intact, but perhaps underused, pathways to provide the necessary clutch on sympathetic activation at 
the level of the cardiac ganglia.
Given that ACh levels in infarcted hearts remained unchanged, we hypothesized that VNS may be 
able to suppress electrophysiological instability or heterogeneity in ventricular repolarization that leads 
to ventricular arrhythmias, reducing inducibility of VT. Low to moderate levels of VNS can reduce 
ventricular arrhythmias due to myocardial ischemia and can, therefore, decrease mortality acutely (8, 
10, 30–32), and termination of VT has been observed in case reports of patients with recurrent arrhyth￾mia after administration of phenylephrine to increase vagal tone (33). However, institution of VNS just 
prior to occurrence of ischemia is not feasible in patients. In this study, mild to moderate levels of VNS 
reduced inducibility of VT weeks after MI. The mechanism for this reduction could not have been due to 
the previously described effects of chronic VNS, such as connexin-43 expression or reduction of inflam￾mation, as these would take time to develop. In this study, acute release of ACh likely led to cardiac 
electrical stability in infarcted hearts.
Many ventricular arrhythmias in infarcted hearts are due to changes in conduction velocity and dif￾ferences in regional action potential duration, setting up the substrate for reentry (34–38). Scars contain 
islands of live myocardium, but border zone regions demonstrated the greatest heterogeneity in ARI, as 
these regions often contain a complex intertwining of variable amounts of viable myocardium and fibrotic 
tissue (16, 19, 39, 40). Intermittent VNS significantly reduced ARI dispersion in these regions. This acute 
electrical stabilization of infarct border zones provides an insight into the antiarrhythmic mechanisms of 
VNS and has important implications for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who suffer from refractory 
VT and defibrillator shock weeks to years after the initial insult. Approximately 30% of patients with car￾diomyopathy and defibrillator shocks continue to experience recurrent arrhythmias despite medical therapy 
and catheter ablation procedures, presenting a dilemma for clinical electrophysiologists (11–13, 41). VNS 
represents a potential therapeutic option that can be used far after occurrence of MI and can acutely reduce 
burden of these arrhythmias.

RESEARCH ARTICLE
Surprisingly, the increase in global ARI of infarcted hearts was greater than in normal hearts. Given 
the decrease in central drive, this increase in response may be due to upreguation of muscarinic receptors in 
the heart. Although an increase in receptor density has not been evaluated in ischemic cardiomyopathy, in 
a guinea pig model of pacing-induced heart failure, M2 receptors have been shown to be upregulated, and 
VNS is able to normalize these receptor levels (42).
Myocardial neurotransmitter levels. Decreased electrical response to VNS in scar regions compared 
with border zone and viable myocardium is not surprising, given that MI is known to damage nerve 
fibers within the scar regions. The reduction in nerve fibers and myocytes would explain both the 
decrease in ACh levels and the decreased electrophysiological response to VNS in scar compared with 
border zone and viable regions of infarcted hearts. However, it was surprising that, even in the scar 
regions, ACh levels and response to VNS, although reduced, were not statistically different from similar 
regions in normal hearts. It’s important to note that areas of low voltage typically classified as “scar” 
represent a complex intermingling of fibrosis and islands of viable myocardium, also observed in this 
study (19, 39). Therefore, the response to VNS seen in scar regions is likely due to viable islands of myo￾cardium and neurites within scars. These axons have intact cell bodies in the cardiac ganglia located in 
the basal regions of the heart that can repair injured fibers. The fact that NE levels in scar regions were 
reduced compared with normal hearts while ACh levels remained predominantly intact suggests that 
sympathetic reinnervation is affected by a different processes than cholinergic innervation. Post-gangli￾onic sympathetic fibers originate from neurons in the sympathetic chain, which is located farther from 
the heart, and their reinnervation may be hindered by different molecules (43) than cholinergic fibers, 
whose cell bodies are anatomically closer. Also, cholinergic transdifferentiation likely plays an import￾ant role in the preserved ACh levels observed (44).
Limitations. We classified scars as low-voltage areas with voltage less than 0.5 mV that still demonstrat￾ed a distinct bipolar recording, as this definition has been validated in clinical electrophysiological studies 
and these sites are used as targets for ablation. Therefore, it is possible that extremely dense scars with no 
clear voltage recording may not contain significant ACh levels or respond to VNS. However, these types 
of sites were rarely encountered in our infarct model and, when observed, often demonstrated unclear T 
waves and were excluded. Epicardial unipolar electrograms were recorded in this study. Therefore, intra￾mural and endocardial effects were not assessed. ARIs were not corrected for heart rate, which was modest, 
as any changes in dispersion seen with VNS that may be due to bradycardia are still physiologically and 
clinically relevant. Fixed pacing during VNS was not performed, as pacing is known to alter autonomic 
tone and cause sympathetic activation (45, 46). Furthermore, we have previously shown that ARIs during 
VNS correlate most strongly with inotropy (or dP/dt), even more than heart rate (47).
Methods
Creation of myocardial infarcts. Yorkshire pigs (S&S Farms) were sedated (tiletamine-zolazepam, 4–8 m/
kg), intubated, and placed under anesthesia (isoflurane, 1%–5%). A guide sheath (Boston Scientific) was 
introduced from the right femoral artery and used to cannulate the left coronary artery under fluoroscopic 
guidance. Microspheres (5–7 ml, Polysciences) were injected through a luminal angioplasty balloon (Fox￾Cross, Abbot) that was advanced into the mid-left anterior descending artery and inflated (Supplemental 
Figure 1; ref. 17). T wave inversions and ST segment elevations/depressions were noted on the surface 
ECG. External cardioversion was performed if the animal developed sustained ventricular arrhythmias.
Surgical preparation. Six to 8 weeks after MI, Yorkshire pigs were sedated (tilteamine-zolazepam, 4–8 
mg/kg), intubated, and placed under general anesthesia (isoflurane, 1%–5%). A 12-lead ECG was obtained 
via CardioLab System (GE Healthcare). Systemic arterial blood pressure was continuously monitored via 
a femoral arterial sheath. Arterial blood gas levels were measured hourly. After completion of surgical 
exposure, anesthetics were switched from isoflurane to α-chloralose (Sigma-Aldrich; 50 mg/kg initial bolus, 
then 20–35 mg/kg/hr) (14, 28, 48) for in vivo neuronal recordings, followed by stabilization period of 1 
hour. Animals were euthanized by an overdose of i.v. sodium pentobarbital (Med-Pharmex Inc.; 100 mg/
kg) followed by saturated KCL (Sigma-Aldrich; 1–2 mg/kg).
Neurotransmitter measurements. Bipolar epicardial voltage mapping (NAVX, St. Jude Medical) was per￾formed in all infarcted hearts 6–8 weeks after MI using multielectrode catheters (2-2-2 duodecapolar cathe￾ters, St. Jude Medical). Based on the voltage map, areas of scar (voltage 0.05–0.5 mV), border zone (voltage 
0.5–1.5 mV), and viable (voltage > 1.5 mV), along with any late or fractionated electrograms, were marked.

RESEARCH ARTICLE
These values have been previously validated in the clinical setting to delineate scar, border zone, and viable 
regions during catheter ablation procedures (49, 50). Border zone and scar regions are characterized by 
low-voltage electrograms that often have prolonged duration or fractionation (Figure 2A) and represent 
targets of catheter ablation in patients (51). Samples (3-mm punch-biopsies) from the LV anterior wall were 
obtained from 15 normal animals and from scar, border zone, and viable regions in 14 infarcted animals. 
All animals were measured 6–8 weeks after MI. Neurotransmitter content was also measured across the LV 
apex, anterior, and lateral walls on the epicardium in 12 normal hearts (to evaluate regional changes that 
may be present and given that, in infarcted hearts, these were the predominant regions affected by scar). 
Finally, ACh and NE content from paired epicardial vs. endocardial samples was also assessed in 9 normal 
hearts. Epicardial to endocardial comparisons were made by obtaining samples directly across from each 
other in the heart. For multiple samples from similar regions of a heart, the weighted average of the neu￾rotransmitter content for that animal was calculated and used for analysis.
Immediately after biopsy in vivo, tissue was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. For neu￾rotransmitter analysis, tissue was pulverized and aliquots homogenized in 300 μl of 0.1 M perchloric 
acid containing deuterated ACh (acetylcholine-1,1,2,2 d4
chloride; 0.5 μM, CDN Isotopes). A standard 
curve for ACh (Sigma-Aldrich) was made up in the above homogenization buffer with final concen￾trations in the range of 0–500 nM. Homogenates were centrifuged and filtered (0.22-μm filters) before 
analysis by HPLC-MS. Samples were chromatographically separated (Scherzo SS-C18 column, 3 μm, 
Imtakt) using 0%–60% ammonium formate gradient and acetonitrile (100 mM ammonium formate/
acetonitrile; 65/35) in 0.5% formic acid. ACh was quantified by a linear ion trap mass spectrometer 
(Applied Biosystems MDS SCIEX 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer) as previously described (52).
For NE analysis, aliquots (100 μl) were centrifuged, and catecholamines were purified by alumina 
extraction. NE standards in the above homogenization buffer were analyzed by HPLC, with electrochemi￾cal detection in parallel with the tissue samples. Catecholamines were chromatographically separated (Mic￾rosorb C18 column, Agilent Technologies) using a mobile phase consisting of 360 mg/l sodium octane 
sulfonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 6% (v/v) acetonitrile in 75 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 3.0). NE was 
detected and quantified by coulometric detector (Coulochem III, ESA) (53).
In vivo neuronal recordings. VIV ganglia were accessed at the fat pad at the atrioventricular junction, 
beneath the left atrial appendage (Supplemental Figure 1). In 10 infarcted and 15 normal animals, a linear 
microelectrode array (16 platinum/iridium electrodes, 500 μm spacing, impedance 0.3–0.5 MΩ at 1 kHz, 
MicroProbes) was placed in the VIV fat pad. Electrode wires, as well as ground and reference electrodes, 
were connected to a 16-channel microelectrode amplifier with a head-stage preamplifier (A-M Systems 
Inc., model 3600). Neuronal waveforms (filter 300 Hz to 3 KHz) were recorded continuously via a data 
acquisition system (Cambridge Electronic Design). Data analysis and signal processing was performed 
offline using the software Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design) (14).
Characterization of parasympathetic neurons. To determine which neurons receive parasympathetic input, 
bipolar spiral cuff electrodes (Cyberonics) were placed around the bilateral cervical vagi after lateral neck 
cutdown (Supplemental Figure 1B). Right and left VNS were performed in a random fashion. Any increase 
or decrease in firing activity of recorded neurons during stimulation compared with prestimulation (base￾line) was quantified and used to identify parasympathetic neurons. VNS threshold was defined as the cur￾rent that led to a 10% decrease in heart rate (1 ms, 20 Hz). Right and left VNS were each performed in 
random order for 1 minute at 1Hz at this current to avoid hemodynamic changes that may reflexively alter 
neuronal activity, and to measure neural activity independent of cardiac function. Basal activity of neurons 
that responded to right and/or left VNS was analyzed for the minute prior to stimulation. Firing frequency 
(basal activity) of these neurons in the minute prior to VNS was compared in infarcted and normal animals.
Once a neuron was classified as receiving parasympathetic input, it was then further classified as 
either purely efferent or convergent based on its response to afferent stimuli (14). Activity of neurons were 
assessed in the minute before afferent stimulation (baseline) and compared during stimulation in 13 of 
15 normal and 9 of 10 infarcted animals. Neurons responding to right and/or left VNS and at least one 
afferent stimulus were defined as convergent, and those that only responded to right and/or left VNS were 
defined as purely efferent (14). Afferent stimuli consisted of mechanical stimuli (gentle touch) applied for 
10 seconds at the RV outflow tract, RV apex, LV mid-anterior wall, and LV apex and occlusion of the IVC 
and aorta for 30 seconds using a snare occluder. At least 5 minutes was allowed in between interventions to 
allow for neural activity to return to baseline/stabilize.

RESEARCH ARTICLE
To evaluate whether these parasympathetic convergent or efferent neurons also received sympathetic input, 
each neuron’s response to right and left stellate stimulation was assessed. The right and left stellate ganglia 
were isolated behind the parietal pleura. Bipolar needle electrodes attached to a photoelectric isolation unit and 
Grass stimulator (Grass Technologies, S88 and PSIU6) were used for stimulation (54). The current required for 
a 10% increase in heart rate or systolic blood pressure at 4 Hz and 4 ms was defined as threshold. Then — to 
avoid hemodynamic effects of stimulation, which could activate neural reflexes — stimulation was performed 
for 1 minute at 1 Hz, consistent with other published data for assessment of neural response (14, 15).
Electrophysiological study. In 21 infarcted and 12 normal animals, unipolar epicardial electrograms were 
continuously obtained using a 56-electrode sock placed over the ventricles, in vivo (Prucka Cardio Lab Sys￾tem, GE Healthcare). The location of each electrode was recorded and color coded (Supplemental Figure 
1C). In addition, in infarcted hearts, bipolar voltage electroanatomic mapping was performed as described 
above, and location of each electrode overlying scar, border zone, or viable myocardium meticulously was 
noted. ARI was analyzed from unipolar electrograms of each electrode using iScaldyn (University of Utah, 
Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) (47, 54, 55). Briefly, activation time was defined from the origin to the mini￾mum dV/dt of the activation wavefront of the unipolar electrogram, and recovery time was defined as the 
start of activation to the maximum dV/dt of repolarization wavefront. ARI was calculated by subtracting 
activation time from repolarization time. ARI has been previously validated and shown to correlate well 
with local action potential duration (56–59). In addition, it serves as a method of recording action potential 
duration without causing myocardial injury. In this manuscript, anterior refers to the ventral aspect and 
posterior refers to the dorsal aspect of the animal. Regional ARIs (scar, viable, border zone) were quantified 
in 18 of 21 hearts.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with delayed enhancement was obtained in 16 infarcted hearts ex 
vivo after completion of ARI recordings and VT inducibility testing. Gadolinium was infused 20 minutes 
prior to euthanasia, and the heart was explanted immediately after euthanasia. MR images were used to 
confirm the location and extent of the scar (Supplemental Figure 1D). In addition, to confirm the presence 
of scar in low-voltage areas, samples from scar, border zone, and viable regions from 5 infarcted hearts were 
obtained prior to MRI and fixed in formalin overnight. Sections (5 μm) of each region were stained with 
Masson’s Trichrome to evaluate for fibrosis.
In normal animals, regional ARIs from LV apex, anterior, lateral, and right ventricular anterior wall 
were used for comparison to similar regions in infarcted hearts. In the 12 normal animals, the median 
number of electrodes used to compare mean ARIs in each region of normal hearts was 4 (range of 3–6). 
For the 18 infarcted animals, the median number of electrodes used for analysis of dispersion was 6 (range 
4–7) in the scar region, 6 (range 4–10) in the border zone region, and 6 in the viable region around the scar 
(range 4–8). To qualitatively evaluate regional ARIs, polar maps were created from the sock electrode using 
an electrode template (Supplemental Figure 1).
Intermittent bilateral VNS (10 Hz, 1 ms, 15 seconds “on”, 15 seconds “off ”) was performed via bipolar 
electrodes around the cervical vagi. The current required to cause a 10% decrease in heart rate was defined 
as threshold, and stimulation was performed at 1.2× this current. ARIs and hemodynamic variables were 
analyzed before and during VNS. After 1 minute of intermittent VNS, during which ARI and hemodynam￾ic data was obtained in sinus rhythm, VT inducibility was evaluated. The duration of intermittent VNS 
ranged between 3 and 5 minutes, depending on VT inducibility and the number of extrastimuli required to 
induce VT.
VT inducibility was assessed before and during VNS using programmed ventricular stimulation (Micro￾pace, EPS320) at two different cycle lengths, up to three extrastimuli (down to 200 ms or effective refractory 
period), from two different sites (right ventricular endocardium and LV anterior epicardium). If VT was 
induced from one specific site at baseline, this same site was used to induce VT during VNS. If sustained 
VT was inducible at baseline, a minimum wait period of 30 minutes was allowed after cardioversion before 
VNS and repeat inducibility testing.
Conditional probability analysis. Conditional probability analysis (14, 15) was used to evaluate the like￾lihood that a neuron classified as parasympathetic based on its response to right or left VNS responded 
to another stimulus such as inferior vena cava (IVC) occlusion. The potential for a connection between 
stimulus X and Y within neurons characterized as VNS responsive was measured in each animal as the 
conditional probability that a parasympathetic neuron that responded to stimulus Y also responded to stim￾ulus X. Conditional probability was estimated as the number of neurons that responded to both stimulus X 

insight.jci.org   https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.86715 1 5
RESEARCH ARTICLE
and Y, divided by the number of neurons that responded only to X, and was quantified in a matrix format. 
Conditional probabilities that were greater than or equal to 0.6 were illustrated in a graphical network to 
assess overall connectivity of parasympathetic neurons in the cardiac ganglia (14, 15).
Statistics. Data are reported as mean ± SEM. For comparison of mean and regional ACh, NE, and 
ARI, as well as ARI dispersion, linear mixed effects models were used and corrected for multiple compar￾isons for statistical significance using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the FDR at 5%. Dis￾persion in ARI was defined as the variance in mean ARIs. For electrical response to VNS, percent changes 
from baseline were calculated first, prior to comparing various regions. Paired two-tailed Student’s t test 
was used to compare changes from baseline for a specific region to VNS and for hemodynamic response to 
VNS. Unpaired one-tailed Student’s t test was used to assess differences in stimulation threshold and basal 
neural activity in infarcted and normal animals. For evaluation of response to afferent and sympathetic 
stimuli, first, neuronal activity was compared at baseline vs. during stimuli and then, a statistical test, devel￾oped for cortical neurons based on the Skellam distribution, was used (60). This test has also been previ￾ously validated for intrinsic cardiac neurons (14). A χ2
 test was used to compare the proportion of the type 
of neurons (e.g., convergent and receiving sympathetic input) in infarcted to normal hearts. Comparison 
of VT inducibility before and during VNS was performed using McNemar’s test. P < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
Study approval. Approval for all animal procedures was obtained from the UCLA Chancellor’s Animal 
Research Committee. All animal procedures were performed according to the IACUC guidelines and the 
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academies Press, 2011).
