Abstract
Background: SOX9 as a member of the SOX (SRY [sex determining region Y] box) gene superfamily has been
previously demonstrated to be a proto-oncogene in a variety of malignancies. However, the clinical significance of
SOX9 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the
expression of SOX9 in HCC and determine its correlation with tumor progression and prognosis.
Methods: One-hundred and thirty HCC patients who had undergone curative liver resection were selected and
immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) were
performed to analyze SOX9 expression in the respective tumors.
Results: Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and Q-PCR consistently confirmed SOX9 overexpression in HCC
tissues compared with their adjacent nonneoplastic tissues (P < 0.01). Additionally, immunostaining showed more
SOX9 positive cells in the higher tumor stage (T3 ~ 4) and tumor grade (G3) than in the lower tumor stage (T1 ~ 2,
P = 0.03) and tumor grade (G1 ~ 2, P = 0.01), respectively. Moreover, HCC patients with high SOX9 expression were
significantly associated with lower 5-year overall survival (P < 0.01) and lower 5-year disease-free survival (P < 0.01),
respectively. The Cox proportional hazards model further showed that SOX9 over-expression was an independent
poor prognostic factor for both 5-year disease-free survival (hazards ratio [HR] = 2.621, 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 1.548-5.829, P = 0.01) and 5-year overall survival (HR = 3.825, CI = 1.638-7.612, P = 0.003) in HCC.
Conclusion: Our data suggest for the first time that the overexpression of SOX9 protein in HCC tissues is of
predictive value on tumor progression and poor prognosis.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
frequent malignancies worldwide. Especially in China, it
has become a major cause of cancer-related death [1]. As
a highly aggressive solid tumor, HCC is characterized
by fast infiltrating growth, early metastasis, high-grade
malignancy, and poor prognosis. It is often secondary to
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infections, both of which increase the risk of HCC 20-fold
[2]. Curative therapies of surgical treatment, including
hepatic resection and liver transplantation, improve the 2
short-term survival of HCC patients greatly. However,
the prognosis for most patients remains poor because of
multicentric recurrence and intrahepatic metastasis.
The progression of HCC is a complicate process that
associated with cumulative genomic alterations [3,4]. The
aberrant gene expression, including oncogene upregula￾tion and tumor suppressor downregulation, is responsible
for the development of HCC. However, the molecular
pathogenesis of HCC still remains unclear.

SOX9 (sex determining region Y [SRY] related high￾mobility group box 9) is a member of the SRY (sex
determining region Y) box gene superfamily [5]. As a
transcriptional regulator, its expression has been observed
in multiple tissues during embryogenesis, including
cartilage, neural crest, notochord, kidney, pancreas, and
endocardial cushions of the heart [6,7]. SOX9 takes an
important part in chondrogenesis, male sex gonad or
respiratory epithelium development, melanocyte differen￾tiation, and the differentiation of Paneth cells in the
gut [8,9]. Recently, SOX9 has also been demonstrated to
be a proto-oncogene in a variety of malignancies [10-13].
For example, Wang et al. [14] detected the expression
of SOX9 in prostate cancer cells contributes to tumor
growth and invasion; In primary bladder tumours,
Aleman et al. [15] found that SOX9 hypermethylation
was present more than half of the cases and SOX9 hyper￾methylation was significantly associated with tumour
grade and overall survival; Malki et al. [16] shown that
the embryonic male prostaglandin D synthase/SOX9
pathway was expressed at both the RNA and protein
levels in different types of human ovarian tumors, point￾ing to SOX9 as a possible diagnostic marker for ovarian
carcinomas. However, the clinical significance of SOX9
expression in HCC remains unclear. The aim of this
study was to investigate the expression of SOX9 in HCC
and determine its correlation with tumor progression and
prognosis.
Materials and methods
Patients and tissue samples
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Commit￾tee of 302nd Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China. Informed
consent was obtained from all of the patients. All speci￾mens were handled and made anonymous according to
the ethical and legal standards.
A total of 130 patients with primary HCC who under￾went a curative liver resection at the 302nd Hospital of
PLA, Beijing, China, were included in this retrospective
study. Tissues used in the study were retrieved from the
tissue bank of the Department of Pathology in the 302nd
Hospital of PLA. These patients were diagnosed as HCC
between 2001 and 2006. None of the patients recruited
in this study had chemotherapy or radiotherapy before
the surgery. HCC diagnosis was based on World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria. Tumor differentiation was
defined according to the Edmondson grading system.
Liver function was assessed using the Child-Pugh scoring
system. Tumor staging was determined according to
the sixth edition of the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM)
classification of the International Union against Cancer.
The clinicopathological features of 130 patients are
summarized in Table I. In addition, 30 self-pairs of HCC
specimens (5 TNM stage I, 8 TNM stage II, 12 TNM stage
III, and 5 TNM stage IV) and adjacent nonneoplastic liver
tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
−80°C following surgery for real-time quantitative RT-PCR
assay and western blot analysis.
The median follow-up period was 8.6 years. Postoperative
surveillance included routine clinical and laboratory
examinations every third month, computed tomography
scans of the abdomen, and radiographs of the chest every
third month. After 5 years, the examination interval was
extended to 12 months.
Immunohistochemistry analysis
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out follow￾ing the protocol of our previous study [17-19]. The
primary antibody against SOX9: rabbit polyclonal anti￾body (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. USA), dilution
1:50. The specificity of the primary antibody has been
validated by the previous studies of Müller et al. [20]
and Lü et al. [21]. Secondary antibody for the detec￾tion of primary antibody: anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA). The negative controls were pro￾cessed in a similar manner with PBS instead of
primary antibody. Further, positive SOX9 expression
confirmed by western blotting was used as positive
controls for immunostaining.
Following a hematoxylin counterstaining, immunos￾taining was scored by two independent experienced
pathologists, who were blinded to the clinicopathological
parameters and clinical outcomes of the patients. The
scores of the two pathologists were compared and any
discrepant scores were trained through re-examining the
stainings by both pathologists to achieve a consensus
score. The number of positive-staining cells showing
immunoreactivity in the nucleus for SOX9 in ten repre￾sentative microscopic fields was counted and the per￾centage of positive cells was calculated. The percentage
scoring of immunoreactive tumor cells was as follows: 0
(0%), 1 (1-10%), 2 (11-50%) and 3 (>50%). The staining
intensity was visually scored and stratified as follows: 0
(negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong). A final
score was obtained for each case by multiplying the per￾centage and the intensity score. Therefore, tumors with a
multiplied score exceeding 5 (median of total scores for
SOX9) were deemed to be low expressions of SOX9; all
other scores were considered to be high expressions of
SOX9.
Western blot
The Western blot protocol and semiquantitative analysis
were carried out following the protocol of Xu et al [22].
SOX9 antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody, dilution 1:50,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. USA) was used, and
GAPDH antibody (CW0266, dilution 1:1,000, CoWin
Biotech) was used as internal control.

Quantitative RT-PCR
To measure the mRNA expression levels of SOX9, total
RNA was extracted from frozen liver tissues using TriZol
reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruc￾tions. Two micrograms of total RNA was subjected to
reverse transcription to synthesize cDNA using the Proto￾Script M-MuLV Taq RT-PCR Kit (New England Biolabs),
according to the manufacture's instruction, followed by
real-time PCR using the TransStart Green qPCR SuperMix
(TransGen Biotech). The primer sequences of SOX9 were
forward primer, 5'-CGA ACG CAC ATC AAG ACG A-3',
reverse primer, 5'-AGG TGA AGG TGG AGT AGA
GGC-3'. The transcription of GAPDH was used as an
internal control for normalization. SOX9 expression levels
were calculated relative to GAPDH using the delta-delta
computed tomography method [23].

P values were given (Mann–Whitney test).

Statistical analysis
The software of SPSS version13.0 for Windows (SPSS
Inc, IL, USA) and SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was
used for statistical analysis. Fisher's exact test and the X2
test were performed to assess associations between
SOX9 expression and clinicopathological parameters.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis,
and differences in survival were estimated using the log￾rank test. A multivariate survival analysis was performed
for all parameters that were significant in the univariate
analyses using the Cox regression model. Differences
were considered statistically significant when P was less
than 0.05.
Results
Expression of SOX9 protein and mRNA in HCC
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SOX9
staining was mainly localized in the nucleus of HCC cells
(Figure 1a). SOX9 expression was absent or sporadic in ad￾jacent nonneoplastic liver tissues (Figure 1b). In addition,
we found 98 (75.38%) of 130 HCC tissues with high SOX9
expression and 32 (24.62%) of 130 HCC tissues with low
SOX9 expression, while 6 (4.62%) of 130 adjacent nonneo￾plastic liver tissues with high SOX9 expression and 124
(95.38%) of 130 adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissues with
low SOX9 expression. Thus, the SOX9 immunostainings
in HCC tissues were significantly higher than those in the
adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissues (P< 0.01).
To confirm SOX9 protein expression by an independ￾ent method, Western blot analysis was performed using
30 self-pairs of HCC and adjacent nonneoplastic liver
tissues. The distinct overexpression of SOX9 protein in
HCC tissues compared with adjacent nonneoplastic liver
tissues was also detected (P< 0.01, Figure 2a and b), as
well as significantly increased mRNA level by quantitative
RT-PCR (P< 0.01, Figure 2c). The expression levels of
SOX9 protein and mRNA in HCC tissues with high stage
(III-IV) were both significantly stronger than those with
low stage (I-II; for protein and mRNA: both P = 0.02;
Figure 2b and c).
Association of SOX9 expression with the
clinicopathological features of HCC
To evaluate whether SOX9 protein expression was asso￾ciated with clinicopathological features of patients with
HCC, we correlated immunohistochemical SOX9 staining
results with T stage, tumor grade, presence of cirrhosis,
underlying liver disease including alcohol abuse, viral
hepatitis B and C, sex, and age (Table 1). As the results,
we found that more SOX9 positive cells in the higher
tumor stage (T3 ~ 4) and tumor grade (G3) than in the
lower tumor stage (T1 ~ 2, P = 0.03) and tumor grade
(G1 ~ 2, P = 0.01), respectively.
Prognostic values of SOX9 expression in HCC
Five-year disease-free survival was observed in 30
(23.08%) patients, whereas in 100 (76.92%) patients,
disease recurred, and 88 (67.69%) even died during a
5-year follow-up period. We observed a trend that 5-year
disease-free survival in the group with high SOX9
expression was significantly poorer than that in the
group with low SOX9 expression (P < 0.01, log-rank test;
Figure 3a). Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier plot of 5-year
overall survival curves stratified by SOX9 expression was
shown in Figure 3b. A significant relationship was found
between SOX9 expression and 5-year overall survival
(P < 0.01, log-rank test, Figure 3b). Futhermore, in a
multivariate Cox model, including tumor size, tumor
stage, tumor grading, presence of cirrhosis, gender, age,
and SOX9 staining, we found that SOX9 expression was
an independent poor prognostic factor for both 5-year

Discussion
In the present study, we provide the first analysis of
SOX9 protein and mRNA expression in human HCC tis￾sue and its association with patient clinical outcome.
SOX9 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in a
substantial proportion of HCC cases compared with
their adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissue. The overexpres￾sion of SOX9 was observed in tumor tissues with higher
tumor stage and higher tumor grade. Additionally, our
investigation reveals that high SOX9 expression is asso￾ciated with a significant trend toward both poorer dis￾ease-free survival and poorer overall survival. Our study
further confirms that high SOX9 expression independ￾ently predicts a higher risk of disease relapse or death
after multivariate adjustment for other prognostic
factors.
Members of SOX gene family share homology with the
high-mobility group box of the sex-determining region Y
(SRY), which encodes transcription factors that bind to
high-mobility group domains of DNA [24]. SOX9
belongs to the subgroup of SOX E genes, which play vital
roles in the regulation of the differentiation of astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells [25]. SOX9 is
involved in the development of multiple tissues and in
maintaining the stem cell compartments in adult tissues
[26]. Mutations in the SOX9 gene may result in auto￾somal XY sex reversal and in campomelic dysplasia, a
syndrome with severely malformed skeleton [27]. Recent
studies have demonstrated the direct roles for SOX9 in
tumorigenesis. In digestive system tumors, Jiang et al.
[28] found that SOX9-transfected cells injected into se￾vere combined immunodeficient mice show markedly
stronger tumorigenicity, whereas SOX9-knockdown cells
injected into severe combined immunodeficient mice
show significantly attenuated tumorigenicity in mice.
Sashikawa et al. [29] then detected the expression of
SOX9 in human intestinal metaplasia and gastric
Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier survival curves for SOX9 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The HCC patients with high SOX9
expression showed significantly shorter disease-free survival (P < 0.01, a) and overall survival (P < 0.01, b) rates than those with low SOX9
expression.

carcinoma. Liu et al. [30] further demonstrated that
SOX9 expression significantly increased from nonneo￾plastic lesions to gastric neoplastic lesions, which might
promote the tumor progression of gastric carcinoma. On
the other hand, Jay et al. [31] found that the overexpres￾sion of SOX9, a novel intestinal crypt transcription factor,
may inhibit carcinoembryonic antigen expression and may
induce apoptosis in a human colon carcinoma cell line.
In human colorectal cancer tissues, Lü et al. [21] also
detected the overexpression of SOX9, and further demon￾strated that the detection of SOX9 expression might
contribute to predicting clinical outcomes for patients with
this tumor. However, the role of SOX9 in HCC remains to
be elucidated. In this study, our data may offer new insight
into SOX9 that is potentially important in the progression
of HCC, as well as new prognostic factor for HCC. As the
130 cases of the present study were all Chinese population,
the results reported here should be further confirmed in
other populations.
In conclusion, our study suggests that SOX9 is overex￾pressed in HCC tissues compared with their benign
counterparts. To the best our knowledge, this is the first
study evaluating the expression levels of SOX9 mRNA
and protein in HCC tissues and its association with clini￾copathologic parameters. Especially, the most important
finding of this study is that SOX9 also is a novel and
potential factor for predicting the poorer prognosis of
HCC patients after surgery. Further studies are needed to
investigate the precise function of SOX9 in the progression
of HCC.
