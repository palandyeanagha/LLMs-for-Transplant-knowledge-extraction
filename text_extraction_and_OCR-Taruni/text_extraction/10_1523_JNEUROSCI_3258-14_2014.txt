Information exchange executed by extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, is a newly described form of intercellular communication
important in the development and physiology of neural systems. These vesicles can be released from cells, are packed with information
including signaling proteins and both coding and regulatory RNAs, and can be taken up by target cells, thereby facilitating the transfer of
multilevel information. Recent studies demonstrate their critical role in physiological processes, including nerve regeneration, synaptic
function, and behavior. These vesicles also have a sinister role in the propagation of toxic amyloid proteins in neurodegenerative
conditions, including prion diseases and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, in inducing neuroinflammation by exchange of informa￾tion between the neurons and glia, as well as in aiding tumor progression in the brain by subversion of normal cells. This article provides
a summary of topics covered in a symposium and is not meant to be a comprehensive review of the subject.
Introduction
This mini-symposium focuses on the role of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) in four contexts that are important in understanding inter￾cellular communication in neural systems: sensory behavior, syn￾aptic communication, nerve regeneration, neurodegeneration,
and brain tumors. The focus is on mechanisms of information
transfer through EVs, how this process is unique compared with
other forms of intercellular communication, and how this infor￾mation can alter cellular phenotypes. This article summarizes
topics covered in a mini-symposium. For comprehensive review
of the subject, the reader is referred to several other reviews on
this topic (Aguzzi and Rajendran, 2009; van der Vos et al., 2011;
Lai and Breakefield, 2012; Lopez-Verrilli and Court, 2013a).
EVs are released by essentially all cells in the nervous system
during normal development, physiologic homeostasis, and re￾sponse to pathogenic conditions. Their composition varies with
respect to cell of origin and physiologic conditions, and they have
a pivotal role in phenotypic responses and fate of cells, including
neurons and glia. This is a new area of research in which neuro￾scientists need to acquire more basic information and explore
whether this form of intercellular communication is critical in
neural functions and whether it can be exploited for diagnosis
and therapy of neural disorders. Interestingly, EVs also have po￾tential use as biomarkers of physiologic and disease states (Rak,
2013; Hochberg et al., 2014; Redzic et al., 2014a, b), as well as
being harnessed as therapeutic delivery vehicles (El Andaloussi et
al., 2013; Gyo¨rgy et al., 2014).
Ciliary EVs mediate communication between animals
Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that protrude into the
extracellular space from most mammalian cells and play impor￾tant roles in human development and health, with defects in cilia
resulting in human syndromes called ciliopathies (Yuan and Sun,
2013). Cilia act as cellular antennae. In Chlamydomonas, Caeno￾rhabditis elegans, and mammals, EVs are closely associated with
cilia, suggesting that cilia may be essential in EV-mediated com￾Received Aug. 6, 2014; revised Oct. 8, 2014; accepted Oct. 8, 2014.

Hogan et al., 2009; Masyuk et al., 2010; Bakeberg et al., 2011;
Pampliega et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014).
C. elegans-ciliated sensory neurons shed and release tran￾sient receptor potential polycystin-containing EVs that regu￾late animal-to-animal communication (Fig. 1) (Wang et al.,
2014). EVs isolated from wild-type C. elegans do not act as long￾range chemoattractants but do promote changes in C. elegans
male locomotory behaviors and male-specific tail chasing behav￾ior. EVs lacking transient receptor potential polycystin-2 fail to
trigger tail chasing. These results show that environmentally re￾leased EVs and EV-cargo composition modulate animal behav￾iors, which is a novel function for EVs. Wang et al. (2014)
propose that EVs play broad and important, as yet unexplored
roles, in communication and behavior in the animal kingdom.
In humans, the polycystin-encoding genes PKD1 and PKD2
are needed for kidney function; loss of polycystin function leads
to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (frequency:
1 in 400 to 1 in 1000), one of the most common monogenic
diseases (Harris and Torres, 2014). In C. elegans and mammals,
polycystin-1 (an 11 transmembrane spanning receptor) and
polycystin-2 (a transient receptor potential channel) act in the
same genetic pathway, serve in a sensory capacity, localize to cilia,
and are contained in secreted EVs released from cilia (Hogan et
al., 2009; O’Hagan et al., 2014; Semmo et al., 2014; Wang et al.,
2014), indicating ancient conserved functions. The M.M.B.
group propose that defects in ciliary EV biogenesis, release, or
signaling may contribute to pathogenesis of ciliary diseases, such
as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and are using
the worm as a model to study the fundamental biology of EVs.
In summary, C. elegans is a transparent, multicellular animal
that releases GFP-tagged EVs from ciliated sensory neurons (Fig.
1), features that enable subcellular imaging in living animals. EV
detection is a challenge and obstacle because of their small size.
The M.M.B. laboratory has developed a system to visualize and
monitor EV dynamics and functions in a living animal and in real
time. To define the properties of an EV-releasing neuron and to
decipher the biology of ciliary-released, polycystin-containing
EVs, they have applied a state-of-the-art technique (Kaletsky et
al., unpublished observations) to isolate and profile adult EV￾Figure 1. IL2 andmale-specific B-type ciliated neuronsrelease GFP-labeled EVs. Top panel,Diagram ofsix IL2 and 21 B-typesensory neurons in adultC. elegansmale(inthe head,four CEM neurons, and in

releasing neurons and identified 295 signature genes (Wang et al.,
unpublished observations). This signature gene dataset and for￾ward genetic screens have the potential to identify pathways im￾portant for EV biogenesis, release, and/or signaling.
Delivery on call: neurotransmitter-triggered transfer of
exosomes from oligodendrocytes to neurons
The role of neuronal EVs is not just limited to release of function￾ally relevant molecules but also to their ability to collaborate with
other cells in the brain (i.e., microglia). The relevance of neu￾ron– glia communication for the developing as well as the
adult nervous system is becoming more and more apparent.
CNS astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and peripheral ner￾vous system Schwann cells (SCs) execute versatile functions that
influence neuronal performance and brain output. Oligodendro￾cytes not only myelinate axons but also provide support to main￾tain long-term axonal integrity (Nave, 2010). Recent work
demonstrated that EVs with the characteristics of exosomes par￾ticipate in reciprocal oligodendrocyte–neuron communication
and deliver cargo from oligodendrocytes to neurons (Fru¨hbeis et
al., 2013a, b). Indeed, multivesicular bodies (MVBs) localize to
the adaxonal cytoplasmic compartment (nearest the myelin
sheath) of myelinating oligodendrocytes in situ, suggesting exo￾some release into the periaxonal space. Oligodendroglial exo￾some secretion depends on neuronal electrical activity and is
triggered by the neurotransmitter glutamate through activation
of glial ionotropic glutamate receptors, in particular NMDA re￾ceptors. Liberated exosomes are then internalized by neurons,
and the exosomal cargo becomes available to the neuronal me￾tabolism, as evidenced by delivery of an ectopic reporter enzyme
activity from oligodendrocytes to neurons. Hence, neurons de￾mand exosomes from glial cells by neurotransmitter signaling
and take advantage of glia-derived cargo.
But do the receiving neurons actually benefit from exosome
transfer? The cargo delivered by exosomes includes a number of
enzymes with metabolic functions, including catalase and super￾oxide dismutase-1, which can help neurons to resist oxidative
stress. Consistently, neurons exposed to oxidative stress or other
harmful conditions survived better if they had received oligoden￾droglial exosomes, suggesting that exosomes are protective and
increase the neuronal stress tolerance (Fru¨hbeis et al., 2013b;
Fro¨hlich et al., 2014). Oligodendroglial exosomes elicit a number
of physiological responses in target neurons. Electrophysiological
analysis of cultured neurons using multielectrode arrays indi￾cated that the action potential firing rate is increased in response
to these exosomes. Furthermore, a number of signaling path￾ways, including the AKT and ERK pathways, appear activated,

is derived fromthe proteolytic processing ofthe APP in early endosomes and isthen retrogradelytransportedto MVBs. Once released in association with exosomes fromthe donor neurons,these
proteins can be taken up in the recipient cells either via endocytosis or by direct penetration. Astrocytes and microglia might aid in the transmissibility. Adapted from Aguzzi and

and the gene expression pattern is modified in neurons that re￾ceived exosomes (Fro¨hlich et al., 2014).
Axon death is a major problem in most demyelinating dis￾eases; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well under￾stood. An evident question is whether glia-to-neuron exosome
transfer might play a specific role in glial support and long-term
maintenance of axons. The role of oligodendrocytes in glial sup￾port was discovered in mice lacking glial genes, such as Plp1 or
Cnp, which suffer from secondary axonal degeneration. Oligo￾dendroglial exosomes carry the products of both of these genes
(mRNA as well as protein), indicating a possible functional link
between abnormal exosome function and axonal degeneration in
these mice. A differential analysis of exosomes derived from wild￾type and knock-out oligodendrocytes as well as their specific im￾pact on target neurons will further illuminate this exciting topic.
In conclusion, oligodendroglial exosomes function as vehicles
for the transfer of biomolecules from oligodendrocytes to neu￾rons and play a potential role in neuroprotection mediated by
glial support. Target neurons appear to control exosome avail￾ability by means of their own activity, implementing a mode of
“delivery on call.”
Vesicular transfer from glia to neurons during regeneration
Nervous system function relies on the coordinated action of neu￾rons and glial cells. In recent years, the importance of glial cells for
several aspects of nervous system function has been underscored.
Phenomena, such as synaptic activity, conduction of action po￾tentials, neuronal growth, and regeneration, to name a few, are
fine-tuned by glial cells. We have proposed a model in which the
axon has certain autonomy from the neuronal cell body, and its
associated glial cell is a major regulator of local axonal programs,
including a regenerative program of axonal extension (Court and
Alvarez, 2005), a destruction program activated by various stim￾uli (Barrientos et al., 2011; Villegas et al., 2014), and local protein
synthesis in the axon (Court et al., 2008). Several intercellular
mechanisms have been shown to operate on a local basis in the
neuron– glia unit, including contact￾mediated signaling and extracellular free
ligands. Recently, another regulatory mech￾anism has emerged in which a cell releases
vesicles containing RNAs and proteins
that are taken up and incorporated into
the target recipient cell (Simons and
Raposo, 2009). Vesicular-mediated trans￾fer of molecular cargoes between glial cells
and neurons has been described in the
nervous system (Lopez-Verrilli and
Court, 2012, 2013a). We have demon￾strated vesicular-mediated transfer of ri￾bosomes from SCs, the peripheral glial cell
type, to axons in vivo after axonal damage
as well as during axonal regeneration
(Court et al., 2008, 2011). Recently, we
found that exosomes secreted by SCs and
selectively internalized by axons increase
neurite growth substantially and greatly
enhance axonal regeneration in vitro and
in vivo (Lopez-Verrilli et al., 2013b). The
F.A.C. laboratory is now using a combina￾tion of next-generation sequencing, pro￾teomics, and bioinformatic analysis to
identify RNAs and proteins present in SC
exosomes, and searching for candidates
mediating the functional effect of SC exosomes on axonal regen￾eration. Preliminary analysis demonstrates that mRNA and
miRNA are selectively loaded into SC exosomes, and some of the
mRNA present in these exosomes encode neuronal-specific pro￾teins. In addition, SC exosomes trigger a broad change in the
transcriptional profile of recipient neurons, revealing novel
growth-associated pathways triggered by these vesicles. This
mode of interaction provides a new dimension to the under￾standing of the intercellular regulation at large, with the pre￾diction that a number of phenomena of the nervous system,
which are still poorly understood, will be revealed under this
new light.
Role of exosomes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
In addition to having crucial roles in physiological processes,
such as neuronal development, repair, and synaptic function,
EVs/exosomes also contribute to the development of disease
states. Neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Parkinson’s
disease, and prion diseases, are characterized by protein aggrega￾tion and deposition in specific brain regions (Bellingham et al.,
2012b). Although the exact pathological significance of these ag￾gregates remains to be conclusively resolved, the biology behind
their formation is fascinating but remains largely elusive. Recent
findings, on the release and spread of several amyloid-forming
proteins, suggest a model where these proteins are released from
affected cells in the form of amyloid seeds and then enter other
cells and aid in the spread of the disease. This poses several ques￾tions. How are these aggregates released from the cells? Once
released, how do they form plaques and propagate in the aqueous
extracellular space to gain access to host counterparts? We pro￾pose that exosomes, defined as endocytically derived nano￾vesicles, are a major vehicle that shuttles amyloids out of the cell
and participates in plaque formation. The L.R. group provides
evidence that amyloids involved in AD, such as amyloid  (A),
are released via exosomes and that exosome-associated amyloids
can act as seeds for plaque formation. A is generated by proteo￾Figure 3. Schematic representation of PMEL-derived amyloidogenesis. Within pigment cells, such as melanocytes, PMEL
reachesMVEsfromthe plasmamembrane(1).Atthe limitingmembrane ofthe compartment,the PMEL luminal domain isreleased
by BACE2 from its C-terminal fragment that is further cleaved by -secretase (2). The luminal domain of PMEL issorted to ILVs by
an unconventional sorting mechanism regulated by CD63 (3). At the surface of ILVs, PMEL domains aggregate into amyloid fibrils
that accumulate in melanosomes (4). The fraction of ILVs that is secreted as exosomes in the extracellular medium is currently
under investigation to better understand the formation of amyloid fibrils at their surface (5).

lytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) substrate
by - and -secretases. APP, BACE1 (-secretase), and the
-secretase complex components are all transmembrane pro￾teins, and endocytosis is involved in A production (Koo and
Squazzo, 1994; Ehehalt et al., 2003; Grbovic et al., 2003; Rajen￾dran et al., 2006, 2008). APP processing by BACE1 and
-secretase to generate A occurs in early endosomes. Further￾more, the L.R. laboratory showed that preclustering of APP in a
cholesterol- and flotillin-dependent manner is essential for its
internalization via a specialized clathrin-dependent endocytic
pathway (Schneider et al., 2008). Then how is the endosomally
generated A released out of the cell? Proteins that are destined
for lysosomal degradation are sorted from the early endosomes to
intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of late endosomes (The´ry et al., 2009;
Bobrie et al., 2011) or to MVBs. MVBs have the ability to fuse
with the plasma membrane to release the ILVs as exosomes
(Stoorvogel et al., 2002). Because A is generated in early endo￾somes in the endocytic route and found in MVBs, fusion of these
MVBs with the plasma membrane may serve as a means of release
of A complexed with exosomes. To test this hypothesis, the L.R.
laboratory found that a small fraction of extracellular A was
indeed associated with exosomes. Immunoelectron microscopy
of exosomes showed that A peptides not only cofractionated
with exosomes but were also physically associated with them. To
investigate whether these findings have any bearing on Alzheimer
pathology, immunohistochemistry analysis was performed with
antibodies against exosomal proteins on brain sections from AD
patients and age-matched control subjects. Enrichment of Alix, a
marker for exosomes, was seen around small neuritic plaques and
a moderate signal in large diffuse plaques in brain sections from
all AD patients tested. Alix staining was largely absent in brain
sections of control subjects. Similar to A, both Tau and
-synuclein are also found in EVs; together, this represents a
novel mode of amyloid transmissibility (Fig. 2) (Aguzzi and Ra￾jendran, 2009).
Study of exosomes sheds new light on physiological
amyloidogenesis
Exosomes correspond to the ILVs of multivesicular endosomes
(MVEs or MVBs). In this context, their study can be very
informative as for their role in MVEs. Among the several cel￾lular processes involved in pathological amyloid formation,
amyloidogenesis, there is an increasing amount of evidence for
the involvement of the endosomal system and, in particular, of
MVEs in its initiation (Takahashi et al., 2002). Within MVEs,
ILVs are thought to serve as processing platforms favoring amy￾Figure 4. The GBM tumor microenvironment. Glioblastoma cells grow interspersed within the normal brain parenchyma. The tumor cells interact with multiple different cell types, including
astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Release of tumor-derived EVs alters the phenotype and transcriptome of recipient cells and enables the creation of a tumor-promoting
environment. Normal cells also release vesicles, and their content may change in the context of the tumor. This figure was produced using Servier Medical Art (http://www.servier.com).

loidogenic conversion of APP (Rajendran et al., 2006; Vella et al.,
2008). In the extracellular medium, exosomes would likely be
responsible for the transmissible character of amyloidogenic fac￾tors through the brain (Aguzzi and Rajendran, 2009). Amyloido￾genesis usually refers to the pathological formation of insoluble
fibrous aggregates from proteins, such as the APP during AD
(Haass and Selkoe, 2007; Greenwald and Riek, 2010). Our work
proposes an innovative approach to investigate the interplay be￾tween amyloidogenesis and MVEs by using a nonpathological
amyloidogenesis process occurring in pigment cells. These cells
have tuned MVEs to produce amyloid fibrils in a physiological
and safe manner (Watt et al., 2013). Interestingly, this model
presents pertinent analogies with amyloidogenesis associated
with AD (Hammer et al., 2008), as amyloid fibrils produced dur￾ing AD and in melanocytes have similar biophysical and bio￾chemical properties (Fowler et al., 2006). These functional
amyloids are derived from the premelanosome protein (PMEL)
that shares several analogies with APP in terms of intracellular
trafficking and processing (Kummer et al., 2009; van Niel et al.,
2011; Rajendran and Annaert, 2012; Rochin et al., 2013).
PMEL-derived amyloids are produced by melanocytes and
retinal pigmented epithelium that are able to produce the mela￾nin pigment in the skin, the hair, and the eyes (Theos et al., 2005).
Melanogenesis is initiated in MVEs that mature into lysosome￾related organelles called melanosomes (Raposo and Marks,
2007). Within MVEs, the luminal fragment of PMEL aggregates
into amyloid fibrils (Hurbain et al., 2008), which further serves as
a structural scaffold for melanin deposit (Raposo and Marks,
2007). The G.R. laboratory and others have evidence that the
formation of PMEL-derived fibrils results from a complex and
tightly regulated cooperation between cleavage and sorting
processes of PMEL. The cleavage of PMEL by BACE-2 (Rochin
et al., 2013) releases its luminal amyloidogenic fragment from
a C-terminal fragment that is further cleaved by -secretase com￾plex (Kummer et al., 2009; van Niel et al., 2011). Concomitantly
to its processing, PMEL-derived amyloid fibril formation re￾quires the sorting of PMEL luminal domain on ILVs by uncon￾ventional sorting mechanisms involving the tetraspanin CD63
(Theos et al., 2006; van Niel et al., 2011) (Fig. 3). Three￾dimensional reconstruction of melanosomes by electron tomog￾raphy (Hurbain et al., 2008) supports the hypothesis that ILVs
can serve as nucleating platforms for amyloids within MVEs. To
investigate the formation of amyloids at the surface of ILVs, our
group has exploited cryo-electron microscopy to image at nano￾metric resolution ILVs secreted as exosomes in close to their
native state. Their data provide further insight into the role of
MVEs and exosomes in functional amyloidogenesis and open new
avenues for the understanding of pathological amyloidogenesis.
EVs as tactics in brain tumor invasion
Glioblastoma cells are known to release a “barrage” of heteroge￾neous EVs varying in size: from 50 nm “exosomes” to 1 m
“oncosomes” containing a distinct set of proteins, lipids, and
nucleic acids with respect to the contents of the cell (Skog et al.,
2008; Garnier et al., 2013; Redzic et al., 2014b). These vesicles
influence surrounding normal cells, including endothelial cells,
microglia/macrophages, and immune cells in the brain tumor
environment, such that their phenotype changes in support of
tumor growth (Fig. 4). Release of tumor vesicles and uptake by
normal cells are associated with progression, angiogenesis, tumor
cell invasion, and suppression of immune responses to the tumor
(Iero et al., 2008; D’Asti et al., 2012; Vader et al., 2014). At the
same time, these normal cells also release EVs taken up by the
tumor cells, with their function still under study.
Our group has focused on the nucleic content of these tumor
vesicles to understand their potential role in this “transforma￾tion” of the brain tumor environment. RNA within vesicles is
quite stable and allows for transport of this labile nucleic acid
across the extracellular milieu and uptake into surrounding cells.
Initial studies showed that both the mRNA and miRNA content
of EVs isolated from primary human glioblastoma cells in culture
was unique, with some RNAs enriched hundreds of fold over that
in the tumor cells (Skog et al., 2008). Most of the extracellular
RNA in these vesicles is of low molecular weight (200 bp), but
sequences up to several kilobases can be detected (Balaj et al., 2011).
Sequencing of EVRNA by othersfindsmRNAs,microRNAs (miRs),
ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, lncRNA, piwi-interacting RNA,
small nuclear RNA, and small nucleolar RNA (Bellingham et
al., 2012a; Nolte-’t Hoen et al., 2012). Interestingly, EVs from
some brain tumor cells also contain a high content of retrotrans￾poson sequences and oncogene DNA (Balaj et al., 2011).
A key question is to what extent is the RNA transferred via EVs
functional in recipient cells. Not only does the phenotype of cells
exposed to glioma EVs change (Skog et al., 2008; Al-Nedawi et al.,
2009), but also the transcriptome of these recipient cells is per￾turbed (Li et al., 2013). Although a reporter mRNA encoding a
luciferase transferred from glioma EVs can be translated in recip￾ient cells (Skog et al., 2008; Lai et al., submitted), this mRNA was
1.0 kb and other studies indicate that many mRNA transcript in
EVs may be fragmented (Batagov and Kurochkin, 2013). Glio￾blastoma multiforme (GBM) EV transfer of miR-1 has been
associated with multiple changes in the cells in the microenviron￾ment that promote tumor growth (Bronisz et al., 2014), but it is
difficult to “tease out” the effect of a single miR in the context of
the hundreds of other RNAs and proteins also present in those
vesicles. The X.O.B. laboratory has found high levels of miR-451
and miR-21 in GBM EVs, which can raise levels in recipient mi￾croglia by up to 40-fold, and this elevation occurs in parallel with
increased proliferation, changes in cytokine profiles and skewing
toward a tumor-associated phenotype (van der Vos et al., manu￾script submitted). Additionally, microglia stimulated with GBM￾derived EVs show downregulation of a common mRNA target
for miR451 and miR21, c-Myc, which occurs both in cell culture
and in vivo.
In conclusion, as evidenced by these studies, the role of EVs is
emerging and expanding in several areas of neural communica￾tion and disease. For example, these vesicles can act as vehicles for
intercellular communication involving signals for behavioral
phenotypes in nematodes. Their ability to mediate communica￾tion between neuron and glia ensures proper signaling at the
synapse and in neuronal repair and growth. However, their abil￾ity to mediate intercellular transfer also confers on EVs a baleful
role in neurodegenerative diseases and progression of brain tu￾mors. In neurodegenerative diseases, they aid in the formation of
seeds for toxic amyloid proteins and also may have a role in the
dissemination of amyloid proteins within the brain. Because
these vesicles can be taken up by cells and release their luminal
contents, they can also be engineered to deliver therapeutic
agents. Because their composition reflects their cell of origin, they
also have the potential to be biomarkers in diagnosis of neural
diseases. More research on the biology and physical properties of
these vesicles is needed to understand their roles in communica￾tion within the nervous system and to deliberate their use in
diagnosis and therapy. Exciting times lie ahead for EV research in

neuroscience, and this symposium reflects this growing interest
and sets the stage for further insights.
