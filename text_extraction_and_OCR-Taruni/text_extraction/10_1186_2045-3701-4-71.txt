Abstract
Background: Ceramides are a class of sphingolipids that form the structural component of the cell membrane and
also act as second messengers in cell signaling pathways. Emerging results suggest that ceramide induces growth
arrest and apoptosis in various human cancer cells. However, the mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity are
yet to be identified. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), a cellular adaptive response, is believed to initially
compensate for damage but can eventually trigger cell death if the stimulus is severe or prolonged. In this study,
we investigated whether ceramide induces cell death in human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACCs) through
activation of the apoptotic ER stress.
Results: RT-PCR, real-time PCR and western blot demonstrated that exogenous ceramide treatment up-regulated
GRP78 and p-eIF2α expression and XBP1 splicing. Moreover, the ceramide synthase inhibitor FB1 abolished
ceramide-induced ER stress. Up-regulation of the ER stress-associated apoptosis promoting transcription factor
CHOP and p-JNK suggested that the antitumor activity of ceramide is owing to activation of apoptotic ER stress.
Mechanistically, [Ca2+]ER depletion and SERCA inhibition by ceramide treatment suggested that it induces ER stress
by disrupting [Ca2+]ER homeostasis. The chemical chaperone TUDCA inhibited ceramide-induced ER stress and cell
death. In addition, the downstream metabolite of ceramide, S1P, cannot activate ER stress.
Conclusions: These results demonstrated that exogenous ceramide induces cancer cell death through a
mechanism involving severe ER stress triggered by the disruption of ER Ca2+ homeostasis.

Introduction
Rapid proliferation of cancerous cells during cancer pro￾gression places a high demand on protein synthesis. The
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical organelle in the
synthesis, proper folding and assembly of secretory and
membrane proteins [1]. It is also the site of lipid synthe￾sis and a major intracellular Ca2+ reservoir. Cellular
stimuli that perturb ER homeostasis, including hypoxia,
failure of protein synthesis, folding, transport or degrad￾ation, ER Ca2+ depletion and oxidative stress, may lead
to ER stress. ER stress triggers the surveillance mechan￾ism known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The
UPR involves the activation of inositol-requiring protein
1α (IRE1α), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating
transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Activation of the UPR
minimizes ER stress by improving the protein folding
capacity of the ER, halting the rate of secretory protein
synthesis and increasing the chaperone capacity in cells.
However, persistent or severe ER stress activates a
UPR that results in apoptosis. Activated PERK, IRE1α
and ATF6 under chronic ER stress regulate downstream
targets, mainly the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein
(C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) and JNK, which
play important roles in the commitment phase of ER
stress-mediated apoptosis. CHOP inhibits expression of

the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and induces the ex￾pression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member
Bim [2-4]. Activation of either IRE1α-TRAF2-ASK1 or
CHOP-CAMK II pathways under ER stress induces
JNK phosphorylation, which activates ER stress￾mediated apoptosis through at least two mechanisms:
induction of Fas and induction of Nox2 and subse￾quent oxidative stress [5-7]. Overwhelming ER stress
eventually activates apoptosis through cleavage of
caspase-12 in murine cells or caspase-4 in human cells,
which subsequently activates executioner caspases such as
caspase-3 [8-10].
The interconvertable sphingolipid metabolites, cer￾amide and sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P), constitute
the sphingolipid rheostat. The dynamic balance of these
two constituents has long been proposed to control the
fate of the cell; with S1P promoting cell growth and
survival, whereas ceramide drives apoptosis, autophagic
responses and cell cycle arrest [11,12]. Ceramide is
produced by ceramide synthase through de novo biosyn￾thesis in the ER. Recent studies suggested that alteration
of ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) activates the ATF6-
CHOP arm of the UPR pathway and induces apoptosis
[13,14]. It was also reported that the combined treat￾ment of sorafenib and vorinostat induces ER stress and
apoptosis through elevation of ceramide level and CD95
activation [15]. However, the mechanisms by which
exogenous ceramide regulates ER stress and subsequent
apoptosis remain unknown.
In this study, we have identified that exogenous
ceramide triggers an apoptotic ER stress response by
treating salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells (ACCs)
with cell-permeable short chain C2-ceramide. We defined
a novel mechanism that activates ER stress via SERCA
inhibition and [Ca2+]ER depletion in response to
ceramide treatment. Furthermore, we observed that
ceramide induces apoptosis via activation of pro￾apoptotic factors downstream of ER stress in ACCs.
Results
Ceramide induces sustained activation of XBP1 mRNA
splicing in ACCs
To test the hypothesis that ceramide acts as an ER stress
activator in ACCs, exogenous cell permeable short chain
C2-ceramide was used to treat ACC-M and ACC-2 cells.
Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) showed a signifi￾cant increase in the expression of the spliced isoform of
XBP1 (XBP1S) after treatment with 100 μM ceramide
for 6 h, and prolonged incubation with ceramide for
12 h further increased this effect (Figure 1A). Changes
in XBP1 mRNA splicing were detected by RT-PCR amp￾lification, followed by PstI digestion. There is a PstI site
in the 26-nucleotide intron of XBP1U but not in XBP1S
mRNA. Digestion of the RT-PCR products with a PstI
restriction enzyme enables XBP1S (not digested) and
XBP1U (digested into two smaller bands) to be distin￾guished [16]. We also observed a slowly migrating spe￾cies (XBP1H), which represents a hybrid structure of
unspliced and spliced single stranded DNAs [17,18].
Real-time PCR confirmed that ceramide induced XBP1
mRNA splicing in a time- and dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1B). Tunicamycin (Tm) and Thapsigargin (TG)
are classic inducers of ER stress, and were used as
positive controls in our study. Tunicamycin inhibits
protein glycosylation in the ER, leading to protein
misfolding and subsequent ER stress. Thapsigargin select￾ively inhibits sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-
ATPase (SERCA), resulting in Ca2+ depletion from the ER
lumen and activation of ER stress. RT-PCR showed that
treatment with 1–10 μM TG or 3 μg/ml Tm for 6 h sig￾nificantly induced XBP1 mRNA splicing (Figure 1C).
Ceramide activates eIF2α phosphorylation and increases
GRP78 expression
ER resident protein chaperons such as GRP78 and
GRP94 assist in the proper folding, maturation and
stabilization of nascent proteins in ER [19]. Elevated
GRP78 expression is an indicator of ER stress. We used
Real-time PCR to analyze the change in GRP78 expres￾sion after ceramide treatment in ACC-M and ACC-2
cells. Incubation with 100 μM ceramide for 6 h signifi￾cantly increased GRP78 expression. Similar to the
expression pattern of XBP1S, the prolonged incubation
time of 12 h induced higher levels of GRP78 expression
(Figure 2A). Upon ER stress, activated PERK phosphor￾ylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which
attenuates the overall mRNA translation rate while
inducing the translation of selective mRNAs with in￾hibitory uORFs in their 5′ UTR [20]. Western blot ana￾lysis showed increased eIF2α phosphorylation after
treatment with 100 μM ceramide for 3 h (Figure 2B).
These results suggest that ceramide activates ER stress
in a time- and dose-dependent manner in ACCs.
Inhibition of ceramide synthase by FB1 impairs
ceramide-induced ER stress
Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a natural competitive inhibitor of
ceramide synthase. Treatment with FB1 inhibits the
synthesis of ceramide and its downstream metabolites.
We therefore examined the effect of FB1 on ceramide￾induced ER stress. RT-PCR showed that 3 h pretreat￾ment with 20 μM FB1 abolished ceramide-induced
XBP1 mRNA splicing (Figure 3A). Western blot analysis
demonstrated the inhibitory effect of FB1 on ceramide￾induced eIF2α phosphorylation (Figure 3B). These
results suggest that the ceramide synthase inhibitor FB1
abolishes ceramide-induced ER stress.

Ceramide induces [Ca2+]ER depletion and SERCA inhibition
leading to ER stress
The ER is not only responsible for synthesizing and
packaging proteins, it also acts as a dynamic Ca2+ store.
It is well established that disrupting [Ca2+]ER homeosta￾sis activates ER stress [21,22]. To investigate the mech￾anism of ceramide-induced ER stress, the Ca2+-sensitive
fluorescent probe Fluo 4-AM was applied to ACCs and
visualized using a confocal microscope. Significant eleva￾tion of fluorescent intensity was detected after ceramide
addition (Figure 4A), indicating the ability of ceramide
to induce Ca2+ release from the ER to the cytoplasm.
To determine the mechanism of [Ca2+]ER depletion,
we evaluated changes in SERCA, which pumps cytoplas￾mic Ca2+ to ER lumen. Real-time PCR showed treatment
with 100 μM ceramide for 12 h significantly inhibited
SERCA2α, SERCA2β and SERCA3 mRNA expression in
ACC-2 and ACC-M cells (Figure 4B). These results indi￾cate that ceramide induces [Ca2+]ER depletion and dis￾rupts Ca2+ homeostasis by inhibiting SERCA expression,
thus further increasing ER stress.
The chemical chaperone TUDCA alleviates ceramide￾induced ER stress
It has been reported that chemical or pharmaceutical
chaperones, including 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) and
endogenous bile acid derivatives, such as taurourso￾deoxycholic acid (TUDCA), alleviate ER stress. To fur￾ther investigate the mechanism of ceramide-induced ER
stress, 5 mM 4-PBA or 1 mg/ml TUDCA was added to
ACC cultures 3 h before ceramide treatment. RT-PCR
showed that ceramide-induced XBP1 mRNA splicing was
significantly inhibited by TUDCA pretreatment, while
only slightly inhibited by 4-PBA pretreatment (Figure 5A).
Figure 1 Ceramide activates XBP1 mRNA splicing in ACCs. (A) ACC-M or ACC-2 cells were subjected to the indicated concentration (10–100 μM)
of C2-ceramide, and the total RNA was isolated 6 and 12 h after ceramide treatment. Reverse transcription to cDNA and RT-PCR was performed to detect
spliced (XBP1S) and unspliced (XBP1U) forms of XBP-1. GAPDH was used as a loading control. RT-PCR products were digested by PstI restriction enzyme in
37°C for 1 h, and then separated on 2% agarose gel and visualized in an UV image system. (B) Cells were treated as in A, and the total RNA was subjected
to Real-time PCR. Relative mRNA expression levels for XBP1S and XBP1U were calculated by normalizing to the signal for GAPDH mRNA in each sample
and comparison with cells cultured in a control medium. The figure presents mean fold over control change in experimental groups ± S.D.
*P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA). (C) Cell were treated with 1–10 μM Thapsigargin or 0.03-3 μg/ml Tunicamycin (positive control for XBP1S expression),
RT-PCR for XBP1 mRNA splicing detection was performed as in A.

Western blot also demonstrated that TUDCA inhibited
ceramide-induced eIF2α phosphorylation, while 4-PBA
only had a marginal inhibitory effect on ceramide-induced
ER stress (Figure 5B). Additionally, we also observed by
RT-PCR and western blot that 4-PBA or TUDCA treat￾ment alone inhibited ER stress marker XBP1S and p-eIF2α
expression (Figure 5A and B). Overall, these results
suggest that the chemical chaperone TUDCA alleviates
ceramide-induced ER stress, while 4-PBA does not have a
significant inhibitory effect.
Ceramide induces cell death through ER stress-mediated
apoptosis pathway
It is well documented that strong or prolonged ER stress
leads to cell death. We next investigated the possible
link between ceramide-induced ER stress and cell death.
CHOP is the central transcription factor upregulated
during ER stress and is considered a major trigger of ER
stress-mediated apoptosis. Real-time PCR showed in￾creased CHOP mRNA expression after treatment with
100 μM ceramide for 6 h, with prolonged treatment for
12 h further upregulating CHOP expression in ACC-M
and ACC-2 cells (Figure 6A). Activation of IRE1α by ER
stress induces JNK phosphorylation [23]. Using western
blotting, we also observed that treatment with 100 μM cer￾amide for 12 h significantly induced JNK phosphorylation
and increased cleaved caspase-3 expression (Figure 6B).
Colony formation assay demonstrated that ceramide
induced significant cell death (Figure 6C). Pretreatment
of ACC-M and ACC-2 cells with TUDCA, but not
4-PBA, inhibited ceramide-induced cell death (Figure 6D).
These results suggest that ceramide triggers cell death by
an ER stress-mediated mechanism. Inhibition of ER
stress-mediated apoptotic pathway by the ER stress allevi￾ator TUDCA suppresses the cytotoxicity of ceramide.
ER stress is induced by ceramide independent of its
downstream metabolite S1P
Ceramide is catalyzed by ceramidase and sphingosine
kinase to produce the downstream metabolite S1P, and
treating HL-60 cells with exogenous C2-ceramide increases
S1P production [24]. Intracellular and extracellular S1P
are both reported to trigger ER stress [25]. We further
investigated whether increased levels of the downstream

indicated concentration (10–100 μM) of ceramide for 6 and 12 h, total RNA was subjected to Real-time PCR. Relative mRNA expression levels for
Grp78 were calculated by normalizing to GAPDH. *P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA) versus control cells. (B) Cells were seeded into 60 mm culture
dishes and the next day cells were treated with ceramide. After 3 h incubation, whole cell lysates were collected and subjected to western blot.
The level of phosphorylated eIF2α was analyzed with anti-phosphorylated eIF2α antibody. Unphosphorylated eIF2α were measured and actin
were used as loading controls. The experiment was repeated several times and the representative result is shown.

metabolite S1P are responsible for ceramide-induced ER
stress. Western blot showed that treatment of ACC-M
and ACC-2 cells with 5–10 μM exogenous S1P induced
ERK1/2 phosphorylation. However, treatment of the cells
with 5–10 μM S1P had no significant effect on eIF2α
phosphorylation (Figure 7A). These results indicate that
ceramide-induced ER stress is independent of its down￾stream metabolite S1P.
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that ceramide induces apop￾tosis in ACC-M and ACC-2 cells through a novel mechan￾ism involving [Ca2+]ER depletion and SERCA inhibition,
leading to ER stress and expression of downstream pro￾apoptotic factors CHOP and p-JNK. The ceramide syn￾thase inhibitor FB1 and chemical chaperone TUDCA
inhibit ceramide-induced ER stress and subsequent cell
death. In contrast to ER stress mediated by S1P elevation
after SPP1 depletion, ER stress induced by exogenous
ceramide is independent of its downstream metabolite S1P.
These findings are summarized in Figure 7B. Delineating
the ceramide-induced pro-apoptotic signaling cascades will
provide potential therapeutic targets for cancer therapy.
Multiple stimuli under physiological or pathological
conditions induce the accumulation of unfolded protein
in the ER, which activates an evolutionarily conserved
adaptive response termed the UPR which leads to cell
death if the stimulus is severe or prolonged. The ER
chaperone GRP78 acts as a major regulator of the UPR
through direct interaction with UPR sensors PERK,
IRE1α and ATF6. GRP78 maintains the three sensors in
inactive forms under homeostatic conditions, and releas￾ing them for activation upon ER stress. Increased GRP78
expression was observed in ACC-M and ACC-2 cells
upon exogenous C2-ceramide treatment, indicating
initiation of the ER stress and activation of the UPR
cascades. Moreover, ceramide induced the ER stress
response in a time- and dose-dependent manner, in sup￾port of the statement that the ER stress is increased as
the stimulus is intensified and prolonged [1,15,19,21].
In contrast to the selective activation of the ATF6/
CHOP pathway of ER stress in response to CerS6/C16-
ceramide down-regulation [13,14], we found in this
study that exogenous C2-ceramide treatment induced
phosphorylation of eIF2α, suggesting the activation of
the PERK/eIF2α arm of the ER stress response. IRE1α is a
transmembrane protein that has both a Ser/Thr kinase
domain and an endoribonuclease domain. Activated
IRE1α uses its endoribonuclease activity to cleave a 26
base intron from XBP1 mRNA, resulting in a translational

RNA was isolated for detection of XBP1 mRNA splicing using RT-PCR. The experiment was repeated three times and the representative result is
shown. (B) Cells were treated as in A. After 20 μM FB1 treatment for 3 h, 100 μM ceramide was added for further 3 h incubation. Whole cell lysates

frameshift and translation of a spliced form of XBP1
(XBP1S), which is a more stable and potent transcription
factor for target genes involved in protein folding and
ER-associated degradation [1,16]. Increased XBP1S expres￾sion was observed in ACC-M and ACC-2 cells upon
C2-ceramide treatment, suggesting that ceramide also
activates the IRE1α/XBP1S arm. The ceramide synthase
inhibitor FB1 is reported to inhibit de novo biosynthesis of
ceramide [26]. In this study, FB1 treatment abolished
ceramide-induced ER stress in ACC-M and ACC-2 cells,
whereas interestingly, FB1 alone had no inhibitory effect
on the splicing of XBP1 or phosphorylation of eIF2α. Con￾sistently, other researchers reported that FB1 treatment
alone does not impair the splicing of XBP1 in LPS-treated
B cells or XBP1-deficient B cells [27]. It might be due to
the relatively low level of endogenous ceramide expression
in ACC-M and ACC-2 cells, mitigating the inhibitory
effect of FB1 on ceramide-induced ER stress response.
The ER is the major intracellular Ca2+ store, and per￾turbation of [Ca2+]ER homeostasis has been reported to
induce ER stress. Ca2+ is pumped from the cytosol to
the ER by SERCA and released through either the
inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor/Ca2+ channels or
ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ channels [28-30]. Although
alteration of endogenous C16-ceramide levels by CerS6
knockdown has been reported previously to trigger ER
stress by modulating SERCA expression and subse￾quently changing the [Ca2+]ER/[Ca2+]IN ratio [14], data
presented here are novel because the role of exogenous
ceramide in the induction of [Ca2+]ER depletion by
SERCA2/3 inhibition have not been described previ￾ously. Our data showed that exogenous ceramide treat￾ment disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis by inducing [Ca2+]ER
depletion, which is in agreement with previous reports
that release of [Ca2+]ER and the subsequent increase of
Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol and mitochondrial

Ca2+-sensitive probe Fluo 4-AM. Changes in fluo-4 fluorescence were determined using confocal video microscopy. As shown in the representative
images, perfusion with 100 μM ceramide induced increases in [Ca2+]ER depletion in ACCs. (B) Cells were treated with 100 μM ceramide for 12 h, Relative

matrix play an important role in exogenous ceramide￾induced apoptosis [31,32].
Both 4-PBA and TUDCA have been reported to allevi￾ate ER stress, but by distinct mechanisms. Recent studies
suggest that 4-PBA represses ER stress by stabilizing
protein conformation in the ER [33-37], while TUDCA
reduces [Ca2+]IN concentration after Thapsigargin treat￾ment, thus inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis [38].
TUDCA was reported to be more effective in inhibiting
ER stress and protecting ER stress-mediated apoptosis
than 4-PBA in steatotic and non-steatotic livers during
partial hepatectomy under ischemia-reperfusion [35]. In
the present study, we observed that 4-PBA or TUDCA
treatment alone reduced XBP1S and p-eIF2α expression,
whereas TUDCA had more profound effects on impairing
ceramide-induced ER stress than did 4-PBA, and only
TUDCA is effective in inhibiting ceramide-induced cell
death. These results suggest that exogenous ceramide trig￾gers ER stress and apoptosis through mechanisms that can
be largely inhibited by TUDCA. Recent studies suggest
that both Ca2+ overload and [Ca2+]ER depletion result in
changes in protein folding and ER stress [22,39,40]. Based
on our findings and the mechanism by which TUDCA
alleviate the ER stress, we speculated that ceramide￾induced [Ca2+]ER depletion might play a major role in pro￾apoptotic mechanisms in ACC-M and ACC-2 cells.
Activation of CHOP is a common point of conver￾gence for all three arms of the UPR. Up-regulated ATF6,
ATF4 or XBP1S expression induces apoptosis by interact￾ing with binding sites within the promoter of the CHOP
gene. In addition to mediating the down-regulation of
Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bim, CHOP also induces ex￾pression of the pro-apoptotic proteins ERO1α and Puma
[1-3,19,21]. Pro-apoptotic ER stress eventually leads to
mitochondria dysfunction, cytochrome c release and
caspase-3 cleavage [10,41]. It has been demonstrated that
reduction of C16-ceramide by CerS6 knockdown activates
CHOP expression [13]. Our study shows for the first time
that exogenous short chain ceramide activated CHOP
expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner via
induction of ER stress. We also identified activation of
JNK and elevated expression of cleaved caspase-3 in
ceramide-treated ACCs. These findings suggest that
exogenous ceramide definitely activates the ER stress￾mediated pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, and pro￾motes the commitment phase of apoptosis.
Ceramide and its downstream metabolite S1P have
long been reported to play opposing roles in the regula￾tion of autophagy, angiogenesis and senescence. A
recent report demonstrates that elevated intracellular
S1P owing to S1P phosphohydrolase 1 depletion signifi￾cantly activates ER stress and survival signaling via the

medium. Total RNA was isolated for detection of XBP1 mRNA splicing using RT-PCR. The experiment was repeated three times and the

Akt pathway [25]. Our data showed that exogenous S1P
treatment had no significant effect on ER stress, which
suggests ER stress triggered by ceramide is independent
of S1P. It might be interesting to further determine how
the metabolic interconversion of ceramide and S1P regu￾lates ER stress.

2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mM sodium glycero￾phosphate, 50 mM NaF, complete EDTA-free protease
inhibitor cocktail and the phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
PhosStop (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Equivalent
amounts of protein (40–100 μg) were subjected to SDS￾PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After blocking
with 10% non-fat dry milk or BSA for 1 h, membranes
were incubated with specific antibodies overnight at 4°C,
followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h
at room temperature. Proteins were detected using horse￾radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Millipore). The
intensity of each band was quantified using Quantity One
software (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) after normalization
to corresponding loading controls.
Intracellular Ca2+ measurement
Cells were seeded on a confocal dish with a glass bot￾tom. The cells were loaded with dye by incubating with
5 μM Ca2+-sensitive probe Fluo 4-AM in the presence of

Figure 7 Ceramide triggers ER stress is independent of its downstream metabolite S1P. (A) ACC-M and ACC-2 cells were seeded into 60 mm
culture dishes and the next day cells were treated with 5–10 μM S1P. The level of phosphorylated eIF2α and ERK was analyzed. Unphosphorylated
eIF2α and ERK were measured and actin were used as loading control. The experiment was repeated several times and the representative result is
shown. (B) Proposed mechanism of ceramide-mediated activation of ER stress response in ACCs. Ceramide induces SERCA inhibition and ER calcium
depletion. This leads to increase GRP78 and activate PERK/eIF2α and IRE1α/XBP1 arm of ER stress. FB1 inhibits ceramide-induced ER stress. Prolonged
ER stress eventually induces apoptosis through activates pro-apoptotic proteins CHOP and JNK.

0.05% Pluronic F-127 in HBSS for 30 min at 37°C, and
then washed three times with HBSS to remove the extra￾cellular Fluo 4-AM and incubated in HBSS containing
1% FBS for 20 min at 37°C. Cells were treated initially
with HEPES buffer and then with buffer containing
100 μM C2-ceramide. Changes in fluorescent intensity
were monitored using an Olympus FluoView FV1000
confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). Image was analyzed by Olympus FV10-ASW 3.1
Viewer software, using Time-series mode.
Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded into 60 mm culture dishes at 200 cells
per dish. After 24 h, cultures were replaced with fresh
medium containing 10% FBS with or without 10–100 μM
ceramide. For ER stress inhibition, cells were pretreated for
3 h with 5 mM 4-PBA or 1 mg/ml TUDCA prior to
ceramide addition. After 24 h incubation, culture dishes
were rinsed three times with PBS. Cells were further grown
in fresh medium containing 10% FBS for 3 weeks. Colonies
were stained for 15 min with a solution containing 0.5%
crystal violet and 25% methanol, followed by three rinses
with tap water to remove excess dye. Colonies were
counted only if a single clone contained more than 50 cells.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 (Chicago,
IL, USA). Statistical analyses were performed using the
Student’s t-test or ANOVA for two-way analysis of vari￾ance. P-values of P <0.05 were defined as statistically
significant.
