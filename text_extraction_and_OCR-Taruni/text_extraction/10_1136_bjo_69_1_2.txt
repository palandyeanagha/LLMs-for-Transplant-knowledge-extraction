SUMMARY The epidemiological and clinical features of primary herpes simplex virus ocular
infection in 108 patients were studied. Of these, 69 (64%) were aged 15 or over and only eight (7%)
were under the age of 5. Associated upper respiratory tract infection was found in 38 (35%)
patients and systemic disorders such as mild malaise, fever, and aching in 34 (31%) patients.
Common symptoms were redness, watering, discharge, itching, irritation, and lid swelling, whereas
pain, photophobia, lid vesicles and ulcers, and blurred vision were less frequent. The major signs
consisted of vesicles and ulcers on the lids, papillary responses which were more severe in the upper
lid conjunctiva, follicles which were more common in the lower lid conjunctiva, fine and coarse
epithelial punctate keratitis, and subepithelial punctate keratitis. Dendritic ulcers and disciform
keratitis were found in 16 (15%) and two (2%) patients respectively. The clinical forms of primary
herpes simplex virus ocular infection varied. Moderate or severe disease was observed in 41 (38%)
and 16 (15%) patients respectively. In eight (7%) patients the disease presented as an acute
follicular conjunctivitis without characteristic lid or corneal lesions. A chronic blepharoconjunc￾tivitis which lasted for months developed in 16 (15%) patients. The epidemiological and clinical
features in our patients were compared with features of the disease reported previously.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) ocular infection is the
major cause of corneal blindness in developed
countries. In developingcountries it is becoming more
prevalent, causing more blindness.
HSV ocular infection may present in various
clinical forms. Acute blepharoconjunctivitis with or
without keratitis, recurrent corneal ulcers, and
recurrent stromal keratitis are common forms of the
disease. ' Primary ocular infection may present as an
acute follicular conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis
with or without characteristic lid or corneal lesions.2
In recent years we have observed changes in the
epidemiological and clinical features of primary HSV
ocular infection in patients attending the External
Eye Diseases Clinic at Moorfields Eye Hospital. In
this report we present the major features of primary
HSV ocular infection observed in 108 patients and
compare these with the features of the disease
reported previously.

Patients and methods
One hundred and eight patients attending the
External Eye Diseases Clinic, Moorfields Eye
Hospital, during the period 1973-80 were studied.
These patients, who had no previous history of HSV
ocular infection, presented with acute conjunctivitis
associated with either characteristic HSV lid lesions
(vesicles and/or ulcers), or typical corneal lesions
(ulcers or stromal keratitis) or were HSV isolation
positive.
The patients were examined with a Haag-Streit
slit-lamp. Symptoms and signs were graded on a Olo 3
scale (absent, mild, moderate, severe).3 Swabbings
for HSV isolation were taken from the upper and
lower lid conjunctivae, placed in a plastic container
containing 2SP transport medium4 with 3% calf
serum, and transported in a liquid nitrogen container
(- 180°C) to the laboratory where they were stored at
-70°C. Each specimen was inoculated into two tubes
containing HEP-2 cells, incubated at 35°C, and
examined regularly for the presence of cytopathic

effect.5 Isolates were identified using an immuno￾fluorescent staining technique.
Two blood samples were collected by venepuncture
at an interval of two to three weeks. Sera were
separated and tested with a complement fixation test
for HSV group antibodies.6
Results
Age and sex. The patients' ages ranged from 9 months
to 66 years with a mean age of 25 years. Of these, 69
(64%) were aged 15 or more, and eight (7%) were
under the age of 5 (Fig. 1). The male to female ratio
was 1-1 to one.
Seasonal variation. The prevalence of disease was
higher in the months of January to June than in July
to December (Fig. 2).
Source of infection. The source of infection was
identified in 26 (24%) cases. Of these, nine (8%) had
been in contact with patients with an active skin HSV
infection, and 17 (16%) had HSV lesions on their
own lips, nose, or face.
Associated systemic manifestations. In 38 (35%)
patients a mild rhinitis and pharyngitis were present
at the time of first examination, and 34 of these also
complained of mild malaise, fever, and general
aching. A mild to moderate ipsilateral preauricular
adenitis was found in 65 (60%) cases. This adenitis
was more severe in the first week of infection and
subsided gradually in five to 10 days. Cervical and
submandibular adenitis developed in 18 (17%) and
12 (11%) patients respectively.
Clinical forms. Moderate or severe disease was
observed in 41 (38%) and 16 (15%) patients respec￾tively. Blepharoconjunctivitis (conjunctivitis with lid
vesicles and/or ulcers) occurred in 100 (93%) patients.
Sixteen of these developed dendritic ulcers and two
developed disciform keratitis. In eight (7%) cases the
disease presented as a follicular conjunctivitis without
any typical lid or corneal lesions.

Ocular infection was unilateral in 88(81%) patients
and bilateral in 20 (19%) patients. The disease was
bilateral at onset in 12 patients and became bilateral
within one week of onset in eight patients.
Course of infection. Mild to moderate infections
generally lasted for two to three weeks. In severe
disease the acute phase of the infection lasted three to
five weeks. In 16 (15%) patients a chronic blepharo￾conjunctivitis developed which lasted for months.
Symptoms. The common symptoms were redness,
watering, discharge, itching, irritation, and lid swell￾ing, whereas pain, photophobia, lid vesicles and/or

ulcers and blurred vision were less frequent (Table
1). Symptoms were most prevalent in the first two
weeks but subsided during the next two to three
weeks (Fig. 3). However, in 16 (15%) patients mild
redness, irritation, discomfort, watering, discharge,
and photophobia continued for several months.
Signs. The major signs observed were associated
with the lids, conjunctiva, or cornea (Table 2).
On the lids vesicles and/or ulcers occurred in 100
(93%) patients (Fig. 4). These were moderate or
severe in 41 patients (Table 2). Vesicles were common
in the first week of infection, whereas ulcers occurred
more commonly in the second week and usually lasted
for two to three weeks. However, in seven cases
ulcers persisted for four to five weeks. In 16 (15%)
patients a chronic blepharitis consisting of mild
to moderate lid margin erythema, scales, and
meibomitis developed. This chronic blepharitis lasted
for months.
The bulbar conjunctiva showed mild to moderate
hyperaemia in 83 (77%) and severe hyperaemia in

observed in 32 (30%) patients. Ecchymosis was
observed in 15 (14%) patients (Table 2). In the
palpebral conjunctiva moderate to severe hyperaemia
and oedema were observed in 56 (52%) and 51 (47%)
patients respectively. Papillae were found in all except
two patients (Table 2). The papillary response was
moderate or severe in 91 (84%) patients. It was more
severe in the upper lid conjunctiva than in the lower
and usually lasted for four to eight weeks. In 35
(32%) patients a mild to moderate papillary response
persisted for six months or more (Fig. 5). Follicular
hypertrophy was found in 101 (94%) patients and was
moderate to severe in 60 (56%) patients (Table 2).
The follicles were small, discrete, and found mainly
in the lower lid conjunctiva. In most cases they
persisted for four to eight weeks (Fig. 6). However,
in 26 (24%) patients small follicles were still present
four to six months after the onset of infection (Table
2). In four (4%) patients a mild to moderate pseudo￾membrane was present.

found in 36 (33%) patients. A mild to moderate fine
epithelial punctate keratitis (EPK)7 appeared during
the first week of the infection. In most cases this
disappeared within three weeks (Fig. 7). In 21 (19%)
patients EPK was followed by subepithelial punctate
keratitis (SEPK)7 (Table 2). SEPK appeared in the
first three weeks of infection and was more prominent
during the third and fourth weeks (Fig. 8). In six cases
SEPK lasted for several months. Small corneal
erosions, which stained with fluorescein, were
detected in seven (6%) patients. Dendritic ulcers
were detected in 16 (15%) patients. These ulcers
developed between days 5 and 10 and lasted for one
to two weeks. Diffuse stromal keratitis, presenting as
disciform keratitis, developed in two (2%) patients
(Table 2).
Virus isolation. Conjunctival specimens were col￾lected from 69 patients, and HSV was isolated from
42 (61%) patients. Fifty-three specimens were col￾lected during the first week of infection of which 34
(64%) were positive. Eight out of 16 specimens (50%)
collected during the second week were positive.
Antibodies. Forty paired sera were tested for the
presence of group-specific HSV antibodies. Four￾fold or higher rises in titre were detected in nine out
of 40 (23%) of these.
Discussion
Primary HSV ocular infection can constitute up to
23% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis presenting at
ophthalmic outpatient clinics.8"9 The true prevalence
may be much higher, because patients with mild forms
of conjunctivitis with a few lid lesions, and those with
acute conjunctivitis without characteristic lid or
corneal lesions, generally attend their family doctor.
Hence, these conditions may remain largely un￾recognised, and treated unnecessarily with anti￾0

treatment.8
In this series of patients the epidemiological and
clinical features of primary HSV ocular infection
differed from previous reports. It has been reported
that primary ocular HSV infection presents pre￾dominantly in two age groups with equal prevalence.8
The first consists of children who have been kissed by
their infected parents, and the second consists of
young adults who have been kissed by their infected
partners. In London the age distribution of ocular
HSV infection appears to have changed. In a previous
study"' five out of 17 patients (29%) were under the
age of 5, whereas in the present series only eight out
of 108 patients (7%) were under 5. In contrast the
proportion of cases in adolescents and young adults
has increased from 41% (seven out of 17)"' to 64%
(69 out of 108) in the present series. It has been
reported that the prevalence of antibodies against
HSV type 1 in young adults is declining," indicating
that infections in childhood are less common. The
decrease which we have observed in the proportion
of children with primary HSV ocular infection may
be a reflection of this decline. The increased pro￾8 20

portion of cases of primary HSV ocular infection in
young adults may be the result of very low rates of
infection in childhood.
We observed moderate and severe conjunctivitis
and blepharitis in 84% and 38% of patients respec￾tively. In previous studies of primary HSV ocular
infection in London' "' and elsewhere' 12 there were
no records of the severity of disease to compare with
our findings. However, considering the general state￾ments in these reports and our observations in the
External Eye Diseases Clinic at Moorfields Eye
Hospital during the past two decades (unpublished
data) we believe that primary HSV ocular infection is
presenting in more severe forms. This increase in the
severity of disease in our patients may be also due to a
decrease in the prevalence of HSV infection during
childhood. Studies have shown that HSV ocular in￾fection is generaly milder in those who have been
previously exposed to HSV in the eye or elsewhere.8
In 7% of our patients the disease presented as an
acute follicular conjunctivitis without typical lid or
corneal lesions. Sporadic cases of HSV follicular con￾junctivitis have been reported previously.2 10 12 " The
largest number of such cases has been found in
London, and most of these patients were between 20
and 35 years old.2 The clinical features, comprising
moderate to severe papillary and follicular responses
with or without EPK or SEPK, are similar to those of
adenovirus and the early stages of chlamydial ocular
infections. It has been reported that HSV may be
responsible for up to 21% of cases of acute con￾junctivitis in London.9 However, in the absence of
routine laboratory investigations for HSV in cases of
acute conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis such cases
cannot be correctly diagnosed and treated.
In this study dendritic ulcers and disciform keratitis
were found in 16 (15%) and two (2%) patients
respectively. Patterson and Jones "' reported the
development of dendritic ulcers and disciform
keratitis in one out of 17 patients with primary HSV
ocular infection. Our study confirms the observation
that dendritic ulcers and disciform keratitis occur in
primary as well as recurrent HSV ocular infection.
In the present series 16 (15%) patients developed a
chronic blepharoconjunctivitis with mild symptoms
and mild to moderate signs consisting of lid margin
erythema, scales, meibomitis, papillary, and follicular
responses. This lasted for several months. In these
patients laboratory investigations showed no evi￾dence of bacterial or allergic aetiology. These findings
suggest that HSV may be a cause ofchronic blepharitis
and blepharoconjunctivitis.
The authors are grateful to colleagues at Moorfields Eye Hospital
for referring the patients and to Miss U Thaker for assistance in
laboratory work. The study was supported by a grant from the
Department of Health and Social Security through Moorficlds Eye
Hospital.
