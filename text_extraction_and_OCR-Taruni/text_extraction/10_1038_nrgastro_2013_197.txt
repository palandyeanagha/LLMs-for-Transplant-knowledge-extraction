T
he future is fatty. Dramatic changes in the lifestyle 
and diet of the global population are fuelling a 
worldwide epidemic of obesity and the increas￾ing prevalence of NAFLD. Experts now predict that the 
next epidemic in chronic liver disease will be a direct 
result of this increased incidence of obesity and NAFLD. 
Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology there￾fore commissioned a special focus issue on NAFLD to 
provide a comprehensive overview that covers the 
breadth of basic, translational and clinical research on 
this important condition.
Fatty deposits in the liver result in a disease spec￾trum—from simple steatosis with no symptoms, through 
to NASH, fibrosis and cirrhosis, which can result in liver 
cancer, liver failure and death. Importantly, NAFLD 
is set to replace viral hepatitis as the primary cause of 
end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation over the 
next decade or so, with the disease affecting both adults 
and children. The question now facing hepatologists 
worldwide is, what can be done to help reverse this trend?
Before clinicians can successfully manage NAFLD 
and help reverse its destructive effects on the liver, 
the underlying disease mechanisms need to be prop￾erly understood. Importantly, this knowledge could 
help in the development of novel therapies as well as 
accurately pinpointing individuals who are not only 
at risk of NAFLD in general, but also those who are at 
greatest risk of progression to the most serious forms 
of the disease. As such, Ariel Feldstein and co-workers
provide new insights into the pathogenesis of NAFLD 
and NASH, in particular noting the mechanisms respon￾sible for liver injury and fibrosis. The development of 
NAFLD is a result of the interplay between host genetics, 
the environment (diet in particular) and, as discussed 
further by Wajahat Mehal, the gut microbiota.
From this improved understanding in pathogenesis, it 
is clear that NAFLD is a complex disease, with consider￾able variation in severity amongst individuals. In their 
Review, Quentin Anstee and Christopher Day discuss 
the underlying genetics of NAFLD and argue that genetic 
variation might account for the heterogeneity in disease 
phenotype and progression. Tackling the issue of pro￾gression, Anna Mae Diehl et al. provide explanations as 
to how NAFLD-related cirrhosis can ultimately progress 
to hepatocellular carcinoma, discussing the evidence 
available from preclinical models and clinical studies 
in patients.
Accurate diagnosis and staging of NAFLD is of utmost 
importance, with histological examination the gold stand￾ard in diagnosis. However, novel noninvasive methods to 
diagnose liver disease are rapidly evolving and Laurent 
Castera provides practical insights into how these 
methods can be used in the context of NAFLD. Upon 
diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH, appropriate management 
must be started. Importantly, NAFLD can be managed 
successfully with diet and lifestyle changes, but pharma￾cological intervention is warranted when these methods 
fail. Vlad Ratziu explores the latest evidence from clinical 
trials on the pharmacological agents currently available 
to treat NASH and the new therapies that are emerging.
Many challenges lie ahead in the NAFLD field. In 
the final article of the Focus issue, Rohit Loomba and 
Arun Sanyal discuss how NAFLD is a global problem, 
with emphasis on the need for improved awareness of 
NAFLD at the society level and more consideration 
of NAFLD in health policies worldwide to secure a better 
future for coming generations.
The unpalatable truth is that NAFLD could almost be 
considered the human equivalent of foie gras (loosely 
translated from French as ‘fat liver’). As we overeat and 
‘force-feed’ ourselves foods that can result in serious 
health implications, however, having such a buttery 
texture in human livers is not a delicacy to be enjoyed by 
hepatologists in clinical practice! 
By highlighting key issues in NAFLD, we at Nature 
Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology hope that the 
lessons learned from the articles in this special issue 
will help set the future research agenda for NAFLD and 
provide ‘food for thought’ on how best to prevent 
and manage this condition. Before the dire predic￾tions about NAFLD become reality, surely the time for 
intervention is now?
