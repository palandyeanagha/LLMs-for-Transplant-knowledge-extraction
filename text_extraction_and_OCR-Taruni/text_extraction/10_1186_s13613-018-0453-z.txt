Artificial liver support systems: what 
is new over the last decade?
Juan José García Martínez1,2* and Karim Bendjelid1,2,3
Abstract
The liver is a complex organ that performs vital functions of synthesis, heat production, detoxification and regulation; 
its failure carries a highly critical risk. At the end of the last century, some artificial liver devices began to develop with 
the aim of being used as supportive therapy until liver transplantation (bridge-to-transplant) or liver regeneration 
(bridge-to-recovery). The well-recognized devices are the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System™ (MARS™), the 
Single-Pass Albumin Dialysis system and the Fractionated Plasma Separation and Adsorption system (Prometheus™). 
In the following years, experimental works and early clinical applications were reported, and to date, many thousands 
of patients have already been treated with these devices. The ability of artificial liver support systems to replace the 
liver detoxification function, at least partially, has been proven, and the correction of various biochemical parameters 
has been demonstrated. However, the complex tasks of regulation and synthesis must be addressed through the use 
of bioartificial systems, which still face several developmental problems and very high production costs. Moreover, 
clinical data on improved survival are conflicting. This paper reviews the progress achieved and new data published 
on artificial liver support systems over the past decade and the prospects for these devices.

Background
In 2016, liver diseases were responsible for more than 
one million deaths worldwide, and the trend has been 
clearly increasing in the last 10 years [1]. Some of these 
deaths occur in the context of liver failure, in the form 
of either acute liver failure (ALF) or acute on chronic 
liver failure (AoCLF). In ALF, the adult mortality is 
approximately 50%, despite the increase in the number 
of patients receiving liver transplants. Regarding AoCLF, 
some recent studies show that one-third of patients hos￾pitalized for cirrhosis with an acute complication develop 
AoCLF, and their mortality thus increases dramatically 
[2]. In this context and given the shortage of organs for 
transplantation, efforts already have been developed to 
find therapeutic alternatives for patients who are wait￾ing for a new organ (bridge-to-transplant) or who are not 
candidates for transplantation but for whom recovery is 
considered possible (bridge-to-recovery).
From the 1990s and onwards, several systems based on 
the concept of albumin dialysis have been developed, the 
best-known being the following: the Molecular Adsor￾bent Recirculating System™ (MARS™), the Single-Pass 
Albumin Dialysis system (SPAD) and the Fractionated 
Plasma Separation and Adsorption system–FPSA (Pro￾metheus™). These systems are based on the concept of 
albumin dialysis and therefore on the capacity to remove 
the albumin-bound toxins that accumulate in liver fail￾ure. These toxins are thought to be responsible for brain 
failure resulting from hepatic encephalopathy (HE), 
renal failure due to hepatorenal syndrome, cardiovas￾cular failure and/or an immunodepression state. These 
devices can also remove water-soluble substances, such 
as ammonia, creatinine or urea and smaller proteins such 
as some cytokines, by standard dialysis.
Some of the substances removed by the different artifi￾cial hepatic support systems include conjugate or uncon￾jugated bilirubin or protoporphyrin, bile acids, glycoside

derivatives, phenols, short- and medium-chain fatty 
acids, such as octanoate, or heterocyclic organic com￾pounds. Removal of cytokines and other recognized 
inducers of HE, such as ammonia or amino acids (e.g. 
tryptophan or glutamine), may be a valuable tool for this 
major complication of liver failure [3]. Some preclini￾cal and clinical investigations also report the removal of 
plasmatic nitric oxide (NO) and some pro-inflammatory 
and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necro￾sis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 or interleukin-10 
[4, 5], even though the final balance in the setting of ALF 
or AoCLF and its contribution to multiorgan failure are 
still unknown.
In the early years following the development of the dif￾ferent liver devices, some clinical trials demonstrated 
haemodynamic and neurological benefits in their use in 
patients with ALF and in those with AoCLF, but many of 
these studies were uncontrolled and included very few 
patients. Some randomized controlled trials showed an 
improvement in survival, but the small sample size, high 
heterogeneity of the included patients and high variabil￾ity in disease severity prevented definitive conclusions 
from being reached [6, 7]. However, artificial liver devices 
have continued to be used in many hospitals, and new 
experimental and clinical studies on them have been 
published over the past decade. In the present review, the 
authors emphasize new data published in this field and 
discuss the future of these devices.
Methods and materials
We conducted research for relevant articles through Pub￾Med (National Institutes of Health) and Web of Science 
published after 1 January 2008. The filter settings used 
were “English language” and “French language” and the 
“humans” filter. The bibliographies of the recovered arti￾cles were reviewed to identify any other relevant papers. 
We included randomized controlled studies preferen￾tially, but we also discussed uncontrolled studies when 
the statistical comparison versus baseline was provided. 
We also comment on other relevant literatures.
Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS)
The Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) 
was originally developed by Stange et  al. [8]. The tech￾nique has been available for broad clinical use since 
1998. The system is composed of a blood circuit, an 
albumin circuit and a classic “renal” circuit. Blood is 
dialyzed through an albumin-impregnated high-flux 
dialysis membrane in such a way that hydrophobic albu￾min-bound toxins are released through the membrane 
and subsequently collected by albumin in the dialyzate. 
The method is based on two basic thermodynamic prin￾ciples: protein-binding affinity and solute movement 
along a concentration gradient [9]. The elimination of 
toxins thus takes place through the diffusion process 
and depends on the free toxin concentration (which is 
mainly affected by the molar ratio of toxin to albumin). 
Toxins are cleared when passing the adsorber columns 
that contain activated charcoal and anion-exchange resin, 
and albumin is regenerated and able to accept new tox￾ins when it passes the membrane again. Additionally, the 
albumin circuit itself is dialyzed in the CRRT (continuous 
renal replacement therapy) method, diminishing the load 
of water-soluble toxins.
MARS is the most widely published artificial liver sup￾port system. In the first few years following its intro￾duction to the market, several animal and in  vitro 
experiments and clinical studies demonstrated its capac￾ity to remove various albumin-bound and water-soluble 
metabolites that accumulate in liver failure and are impli￾cated in some of its major complications, such as HE [3, 
10].
Another point of interest has been the ability of MARS 
to eliminate cytokines and modulate the inflammatory 
response involved in liver failure. Cytokines have been 
implicated in the development of HE, vasodilation, sys￾temic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and mul￾tiple organ failure (MOF). These proteins are believed to 
mediate hepatic inflammation, cholestasis and liver cell 
necrosis and apoptosis [11, 12]. From a theoretical stand￾point, the removal of some pro-inflammatory cytokines 
may counteract some clinical complications of liver fail￾ure related to the inflammatory and hyperdynamic state. 
However, anti-inflammatory cytokines would also be 
removed, and the final imbalance and its contribution to 
multiorgan failure in the setting of ALF or AoCLF are still 
unknown. Old and new works show a significant elimina￾tion of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, 
interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 β, and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines, such as interleukin-10, by the MARS device [4, 
5, 13]. However, other studies failed to demonstrate an 
effective change in the plasma cytokine concentration in 
patients with liver failure, perhaps due to the high rate of 
production in this setting [14, 15]. In 2013, Donati et al. 
[16] published the results of 269 MARS treatments that 
showed no effect on cytokine plasma levels but a signifi￾cant increase in hepatic growth factor levels (a humoral 
hepatotrophic factor that enhances liver regeneration). 
Interestingly, Dominik et  al. [17] demonstrated, in an 
in vitro study, that the removal of some cytokines could 
be drastically improved by using MARS with larger pore 
membranes, which could contribute to optimizing the 
cytokine plasma profile of patients. We must also con￾sider the removal of plasmatic NO, which plays a cen￾tral role in the multifactorial phenomenon of splanchnic 
and systemic vasodilatation and the hyperdynamic state

associated with liver failure. In conclusion, the precise 
roles of different cytokines in the pathophysiology of liver 
failure and the influence of MARS on cytokine plasmatic 
profiles have not yet been fully elucidated over the last 
years. This represents undoubtedly a very interesting line 
of research for the future.
In recent years, some authors have been interested 
in other active biological substances that can also be 
removed by MARS. Gay et al. [18] explored the proteins 
dialyzed and then absorbed in the anion-exchange resin 
cartridge of MARS in patients with cholestasis and pruri￾tus and found some biological relevant proteins, such as 
secreted Ly6/uPAR-related protein-1 (SLURP1) or defen￾sin human neutrophil peptide–1 (HNP-1), which are 
involved in the inflammatory and defensive processes. In 
contrast, MARS does not appear to influence the plasma 
levels of other molecules with known immunomodula￾tory effects, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
lipocalin  (NGAL) or the chemokines monocyte chem￾oattractant protein-1 (MCP-2) and macrophage inflam￾matory protein-3 alpha (MIP-3α), according to some 
published studies [19, 20].
In vitro and in vivo studies have explored the elimina￾tion of some antibiotics by MARS, showing, for example, 
a significant removal of the low protein-bound antibiotics 
moxifloxacin and meropenem [21]. Similar results have 
been found with piperacillin/tazobactam. Surprisingly, 
one case report showed minimal removal of the highly 
protein-bound immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus [22]. 
Special attention should be paid to the dose adjustment 
and monitoring of some critical drugs during MARS 
sessions, and additional pharmacokinetic studies are 
required.
The optimal anticoagulation regimen during MARS has 
also been discussed. This is an important issue consider￾ing the difficult haemostasis balance in patients suffering 
from hepatic failure, who are at high risk of haemor￾rhagic and thrombotic phenomena. The best-known and 
most used method is unfractionated heparin, but there 
are some concerns regarding haemorrhagic risk and 
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Some studies have 
explored the use of continuous extracorporeal systems 
without anticoagulation and have found a comparable 
circuit lifespan [23]. In this sense, the anticoagulant-free 
approach may be a valid option in patients at high risk 
of bleeding. Local anticoagulation with citrate may also 
become a good option if close metabolic monitoring is 
exercised, and some studies have shown that it is safe 
and that it guarantees a longer treatment time, prevent￾ing filter loss [24, 25]. However, its widespread use can￾not be recommended at this stage. In most clinical trials, 
unfractionated heparin was the anticoagulant of choice, 
but some studies have used local citrate anticoagulation, 
especially trials with FPSA [26, 27], with no reported 
adverse effects. The use of prostacyclin can be found 
anecdotally in the literature.
From a technical point of view, several questions have 
been raised about the stability of the binding properties 
of albumin after passing the adsorber columns or about 
the influence and clinical relevance of some stabilizers 
(such as octanoate) used in commercial albumin prepara￾tions [28, 29]. Nevertheless, there are no definitive con￾clusions, and these issues should be the subject of further 
study in the future.
With respect to clinical outcomes, several studies were 
published in the first years following MARS commercial 
availability, mostly of a retrospective and an uncontrolled 
nature. Most of them demonstrated benefits in terms of 
encephalopathy, and some showed improvement in the 
haemodynamic parameters. The few randomized con￾trolled trials (RCT) assessing survival presented conflict￾ing results [30–32]. These trials included few patients 
suffering from AoCLF, which was defined in a variable 
way according to each study. No well-conducted RCTs 
were published during this period in the field of ALF.
In the last decade, new studies have been performed to 
help understand the potential clinical benefits of using 
MARS. Nevertheless, patient series remain limited, 
definitions and inclusion criteria are strongly variable, 
and randomized controlled trials are scarce. We have 
divided recent studies found in the literature according 
to whether target patients suffer exclusively from ALF or 
AoCLF or whether both group of patients are included 
together (mostly in meta-analysis studies). We also report 
some clinical studies that point to other medical indica￾tions for MARS (miscellaneous).
MARS for acute liver failure
Several studies on the use of MARS in the field of ALF 
have been published in the last decade. These studies are 
summarized in Table 1.
Unfortunately, only one trial, which was presented 
by Saliba et  al. [33], was controlled and randomized. 
This trial included 102 patients with ALF and without 
an absolute contraindication for liver transplantation. 
Patients were recruited from 16 liver transplantation cen￾tres across France (mostly from three centres). The trial 
could be rated as fair, as it scored 3 on the Oxford qual￾ity scoring system [34]. We cannot consider it to be good 
(scores 4–5) because the trial was not blinded. Patients 
received conventional treatment alone or conventional 
treatment combined with MARS and were stratified 
according to whether or not the ALF was paracetamol 
induced. The study failed to prove a significant difference 
in the overall 6-month survival and in the 6-month trans￾plant-free survival and 1-year survival. Additionally, there

was no significant improvement in encephalopathy with 
the MARS therapy, unlike most other published works. 
It is noted that the 6-month transplant-free survival was 
greater among the patients with paracetamol-induced 
ALF than that of the others (38% vs. 13%, respectively, 
p<0.01). These disappointing results must be interpreted 
carefully, as the high transplantation rate and the short 
delay from randomization to liver transplantation in 
the study preclude definitive conclusions. Indeed, 14 of 
the 53 patients in the MARS group initially eligible for 
analysis were ultimately excluded because they did not 
receive MARS or they only received a short session of it 
because an organ was readily available. Sixty-six patients 
(64.7%) underwent transplantation, of whom 75% did so 
within the first 24 h following a wait-list registration. As 
patients with contraindication to liver transplantation 
were excluded from the trial, we cannot indicate whether 
the use of MARS might be helpful in this population and 
whether these patients could especially benefit from this 
technique (last-line treatment).
Some non-randomized controlled studies were also 
published, the largest being the work of Kantola et  al. 
[35], which included 113 prospectively collected patients 
who received MARS and a retrospectively collected 
historic control group of 46 patients with whom they 
were compared. There was no significant difference in 
the 28-day and 6-month survival rates between the two 
groups. The native liver recovery rate of the MARS group 
was higher than that of the control group (49% vs. 17%, 
respectively, p<0.01), and the transplant-free survival 
was also higher (66% vs. 40%, p<0.05). However, the trial 
design and the predominantly toxic aetiology of ALF in 
the MARS group greatly hampered the interpretation 
of these results. In the most homogenous subgroup of 
patients with ALF of an unknown aetiology, there was a 
trend towards a better survival, but this was without sta￾tistical significance. The MARS patients in the other sub￾groups had a significantly lower model for end-stage liver 
disease (MELD) score compared to that of the control 
group, which also precludes definitive conclusions.
Two other controlled trials recently published failed to 
prove a survival improvement with MARS. As these are 
non-randomized studies, inclusion in the intervention 
group depended, to a large extent, on the treating phy￾sician, which is a major bias. In the work of Lexmond 
et  al. [36], MARS treatment was reserved for the most 
severe patients, and these patients had a significantly 
higher HE grade (3.4 vs. 2, respectively, p<0.01) and 
PELD (Paediatric End-Stage Liver Disease)/MELD score 
(47 vs. 38, p<0.05) than those in the other group. In the 
study published by Gerth et  al. [37], the whole cohort 
was composed of mildly ill patients (HE grade≤1 and 
no vasopressor drugs). Some uncontrolled studies show 
haemodynamic and neurological improvements but 
include few patients and are of limited quality.
MARS for acute on chronic liver failure
Trials published in the setting of AoCLF are summarized 
in Table  2. Only one correctly randomized controlled 
trial assessing survival and other clinical outcomes in this 
setting has been published in recent years: the RELIEF 
trial by Bañares et al. [38]. This relatively large multicen￾tric trial, which scored 3 on the Oxford quality scoring 
system [34], failed to demonstrate a survival benefit with 
MARS use in both the general population included and 
in all of the predefined subgroups. The study showed a 
trend of improvement in HE in the MARS group com￾pared to that of the control group, but this was without 
statistical significance. It should be pointed out that some 
of the exclusion criteria (platelets<50.000/mm3, interna￾tional normalized ratio>2.3 or haemodynamic instabil￾ity) could have ruled out the more severe patients. The 
authors also discuss the appropriateness of the schedule 
or dosage of the MARS sessions chosen.
In a different way, a work presented by Hessel et  al. 
[39], which was primarily designed to explore the cost￾effectiveness of MARS in patients with AoCLF, showed 
that the cumulative survival probability at 3  years was 
higher in the MARS group (logrank p<0.05). However, 
the randomization in the study was rather unclear, and 
the follow-up was too long to interpret the true influence 
of the technique on mortality.
Recently, Gerth et  al. [40] published a retrospec￾tive, controlled, non-randomized study that included 
101 patients with AoCLF graded according to the new 
Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) crite￾ria [41]. The study showed a significant reduction in 
early mortality in the MARS group compared to that 
of the standard medical therapy (SMT) group on day 
7 (0% vs. 18.5%, respectively, p<0.01) and day 14 (6.4% 
vs. 27.8%, p<0.05). This effect disappeared at day 21, 
which could be explained by the interruption of therapy 
(in the MARS group, extracorporeal therapy was per￾formed almost daily, with a median of three sessions per 
patient). The 14-day mortality was especially reduced 
among patients with two or more organ failures (9.5% in 
MARS group vs. 50% in SMT group, p<0.01). Further￾more, in Kaplan–Meier estimates of the 28-day survival 
rate in this subgroup of patients, MARS was associ￾ated with improvement (logrank p<0.05). Similarly, the 
authors performed a secondary analysis of the RELIEF 
trial data (36) using the CLIF-C criteria and showed a 
benefit from MARS in regard to the 14-day mortality in 
the subgroup of patients with two or more organ failures, 
but this was without statistical significance. Despite its 
limitations, this study suggests the necessity for further 

García Martínez and Bendjelid Ann. Intensive Care (2018) 8:109 Page 6 of 14
trials targeting those more severe patients suffering from 
AoCLF, who may especially benefit from the technique.
In addition, a meta-analysis published by Shen et  al. 
[42] in 2016, which enrolled studies that included 
patients with AoCLF, showed a significative reduction in 
mortality with the use of artificial liver support systems. 
However, this meta-analysis included several non-ran￾domized trials, and some of the studies used restrictive 
inclusion criteria and techniques other than MARS in 
the intervention group. The largest RCT used plasma 
exchange as liver support and included only patients with 
HBV-associated AoCLF [43]. These encouraging results 
must therefore be interpreted with caution.
Trials in the setting of AoCLF are conditioned by the 
absence of a worldwide recognized definition of AoCLF, 
which makes the selection of patients for these studies 
quite variable [44]. In this regard, the acceptance and use 
of an international definition can be a key step in opti￾mizing future research.
MARS for acute liver failure and acute on chronic liver 
failure combined
The few published trials that included ALF and AoCLF 
patients together are uncontrolled and retrospective. 
Notwithstanding, several systematic reviews and meta￾analyses including RCTs published over the last 20 years 
have been presented recently. These studies included 
patients with ALF and AoCLF, and they are summarized 
in Table 3.
The meta-analysis published by Vaid et al. [52] in 2012 
and the one published by Tsipotis et  al. [53] in 2015 
included quite similar trials. However, the work of Tsi￾potis included only RCT trials and was published 3 years 
later, allowing the authors to include the larger study 
by Saliba et  al. [33] and complete data from the study 
by Bañares et  al. [38], which had already been included 
in the meta-analysis by Vaid but which was reported as 
only a scientific abstract at the time. Both meta-analyses 
showed an improvement in hepatic encephalopathy with 
MARS (OR=3.0, p<0.01 in the Vaid study; RR=1.5, 
p<0.01 in the Tsipotis study). Disappointingly, neither 
meta-analysis showed a significant effect of MARS on 
mortality. Tsipotis also included some trials using Pro￾metheus in its meta-analysis, such as the RCT published 
by Kribben et  al. [26], which were meta-analyzed sepa￾rately and combined with MARS trials with the same 
result.
Two systematic reviews, one published by Stutchfield 
et  al. [54] in 2011 and the other by Guo-Lin He et  al. 
[55] in 2015, conducted a separate meta-analysis for tri￾als involving patients with ALF or AoCLF. In both stud￾ies, extracorporeal liver support significantly reduced

mortality in patients with ALF compared to SMT, and no 
beneficial effect on survival in AoCLF was found. How￾ever, the study of Stutchfield et  al. included trials using 
bioartificial devices, precluding any specific conclusion 
for MARS.
In the systematic review by Guo-Lin He et al., only tri￾als using MARS in the intervention group were included. 
In the meta-analysis of the four RCTs that involved 
patients with ALF, the authors compared the survival 
in the non-transplanted patients and found that MARS 
therapy significantly reduced mortality compared to 
SMT (RR=0.61, p<0.05). This result can be confound￾ing because very few patients were included. Further￾more, the inclusion criteria are quite different over the 
studies with two trials exclusively involving patients with 
liver failure secondary to cardiogenic shock. With the 
exception of the Saliba study [33], the other RCTs did not 
report on follow-up or allocation data, and scored low 
on the CONSORT score analysis [56]. One study did not 
have survival as a primary outcome. Nevertheless, the 
results are consistent across studies (p=0.52; I
2=0%) 
and suggest that MARS may be a valuable tool in the sub￾group of patients with ALF who are critically ill.
Another meta-analysis published by Zheng et al. [57] in 
2013 found a mortality benefit of artificial liver support 
systems over SMT in patients with liver failure. However, 
the study did not focus on albumin dialysis and included 
earlier studies using transfusion, haemoperfusion, hae￾mofiltration and other outdated devices, such as the Bio￾Logic-DT system.

In this regard, and in order to identify the patients who 
could most benefit from MARS therapy, Kantola et  al. 
[58] analyzed 188 patients treated with MARS, most of 
whom suffered from ALF or AoCLF (some patients with 
graft failure and other liver injuries were also included). 
In this prospective observational study, the authors iden￾tified the aetiology of liver disease as the main factor in 
the survival and recovery without transplantation, with 
the non-transplanted patients with AoCLF having the 
highest mortality and probably benefitting minimally 
from the MARS treatment. The 1-year survival rates of all 
of the transplanted patients in the study were very high 
(91% for the ALF patients), which the authors attributed 
to the clinical and biochemical improvements achieved 
with MARS. The grade of encephalopathy prior to MARS 
treatment and coagulation factors levels were identified 
as prognostic factors in ALF.
At this time, larger RCTs with well-defined inclusion 
criteria are still required to confirm the benefits of MARS 
and to be able to widely recommend its use. In the case of 
ALF, which is often a life-threatening condition, the use 
of MARS as a bridge-to-transplant to gain time or, even￾tually, as a bridge-to-recovery, is warranted.
Miscellaneous
Table  4 summarizes recently published trials in which 
MARS was used in clinical indications other than for 
ALF or AoCLF. At least one ongoing RCT was identi￾fied on the US-based clinical trials registration website 
(Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS®) in 
Hypoxic Hepatitis, clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01690845). The 
current status of this trial is unknown.
Single‑Pass Albumin Dialysis (SPAD)
Single-Pass Albumin Dialysis was described as an alter￾native to more sophisticated devices, such as MARS, in 
the late 1990s [65]. It is the simplest artificial liver device 
and can be applied in any intensive care unit employing a 
standard CRRT. No additional adsorbent columns or cir￾cuits are required. The patient’s blood is dialyzed through 
a high-flux hollow-fibre haemodiafilter using an albu￾min-containing dialyzate. After passing through the dia￾lyzer, the dialyzate is discarded (in contrast to the MARS 
system, in which the albumin dialyzate is regenerated), 
and the toxins are thus removed from the system. High 
amounts of albumin are consumed with SPAD, making 
this treatment substantially expensive.
In 2004, Sauer et  al. [66] published one of the first 
papers comparing the in vitro detoxification capacities of 
SPAD and MARS for water-soluble and protein-bound 
compounds (bilirubin and bile acids) and demonstrated 
that the performances of the two were similar and that 
both were superior to standard continuous venovenous 
haemodiafiltration (CVVHD). The authors used a 4.4% 
albumin dialyzate solution.
These results were partially confirmed in vivo by Kort￾gen et  al. [67], who compared the detoxification capac￾ity of the two techniques in patients with liver failure.

They showed a significant decrease in the serum bilirubin 
level with both treatments. However, only with MARS 
did the creatinine and urea levels significantly decrease. 
There were no significant differences in the other bio￾chemical, haemodynamic or clinical values. The study 
was retrospective and non-randomized, and there were 
far fewer patients in the SPAD arm than there were in 
the MARS arm. The authors performed SPAD with a 5% 
albumin dialyzate solution and a low dialyzate flow rate 
(700 mL/h), which probably influenced the results.
The determination of the optimal albumin concentra￾tion in the dialyzate solution or that of the most efficient 
dialyzate flow rate when carrying out SPAD was already 
addressed by Churchwell et  al. [68] in 2009. They com￾pared the effect of various blood flow rates, dialyzate flow 
rates, dialyzate albumin concentrations (0%, 2.5% and 
5%) and dialyzers on the clearance of some highly pro￾tein-bound drugs (valproic acid and carbamazepine). The 
authors demonstrated that the highest extraction ratios 
were achieved using the combination of 5% albumin 
dialyzate and a larger polysulfone dialyzer (surface area 
1.5 m2
). Two years later, Benyoub et al. [69] showed sig￾nificant reductions in the bilirubin and bile acid levels in 
patients suffering from ALF or AoCLF from using SPAD 
with a 3.2% albumin dialyzate and a 1000  mL/h dialyz￾ate flow rate. More recently, Schmuck et al. [70] found, in 
an in vitro model, an optimal detoxification efficiency for 
albumin-bound substances (bilirubin and bile acids) with 
a 3% albumin concentration and a dialyzate flow rate of 
1000 mL/h. They used SPAD with conventional CVVHD 
and a high-flux polysulfone haemodiafilter.
With respect to clinical data on SPAD, only a few case 
reports were published in the early years, and there are 
currently no published studies that focus on demonstrat￾ing the clinical benefits of SPAD versus standard medi￾cal therapy (SMT) in ALF or AoCLF. Two retrospective 
uncontrolled studies reviewing data from patients with 
liver failure treated with SPAD as rescue therapy were 
identified. One included paediatric patients with ALF of 
different aetiologies [71], and the other included adults 
patients with severe liver dysfunction in a context of alco￾holic liver disease who were treated with SPAD or Pro￾metheus [72]. Neither of these studies allow us to draw 
conclusions about the clinical usefulness of SPAD, and 
they only show us its relative ease of use and the absence 
of unexpected complications from its use.
The only randomized study using SPAD was recently 
published by Sponholz et al. [73]. This is a randomized, 
controlled crossover study comparing the detoxification 
capacity and influence on clinical and paraclinical param￾eters of SPAD (4% albumin dialyzate solution; 700 mL/h 
dialysis flow rate) and MARS (20% albumin flow rate 
equal to the blood flow rate, 2000  mL/h dialysis flow 
rate). The authors found similar reductions in the total 
plasma bilirubin levels, without significant differences 
between the two devices. The reductions in the total bile 
acids and γ-glutamyl transferase levels in the SPAD arm 
were non-significant. The creatinine and urea levels were 
not significantly reduced with SPAD compared to those 
of MARS. In contrast to other studies, neither MARS nor 
SPAD induced a reduction in the systemic cytokine lev￾els. Moreover, the patients treated with SPAD presented 
some metabolic derangements such as increasing lactate 
levels or decreasing calcium levels, which are probably 
explained by the preferential use of citrate anti-coagu￾lation with a low dialysis flow rate. The effects of MARS 
and SPAD on the clinical parameters (HE and haemody￾namic status) were small and equivalent.
Currently, SPAD may be an easy-to-use alternative to 
MARS, but the optimal albumin dialyzate concentration, 
dialyzate flow rate and treatment regimen are not yet 
fully established. A new randomized crossover trial com￾paring MARS and SPAD (with the change in the plasma 
levels of total bilirubin as the primary endpoint, and with 
tolerance, change in bile acid levels, change in conju￾gate bilirubin levels, pulsatility index of the middle cer￾ebral artery and HE score as the secondary endpoints) is 
underway. The recruitment phase of the study has actu￾ally completed (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02310542).
Fractionated Plasma Separation and Adsorption–
FPSA (Prometheus)
The FPSA method was first described by Falkenhagen 
et al. [74]. While MARS uses an exogenous albumin solu￾tion, the available Prometheus machine allows for the 
patient’s own albumin to enter the first circuit using the 
AlbuFlow® filter (molecular cut-off of 250 kDa). Albumin 
is reactivated and returned to circulation using a neutral 
resin adsorber (Prometh® 01) and an anion-exchange 
column (Prometh® 02). The blood then enters a second 
circuit where it is treated by conventional high-flux hae￾modialysis before being returned to the patient.
In the first 10  years after its appearance on the mar￾ket, some studies demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo 
efficacy of Prometheus in clearing ammonia, bilirubin 
or bile acids, showing that it performs even better than 
MARS does [75].
These results have been confirmed in recent years. In 
2009, Grodzicki el al. [76] showed significant decreases 
in serum ammonia, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, 
alanine aminotransferase, urea and creatinine with the 
use of FPSA in patients suffering from ALF. Rifai et  al. 
[77] demonstrated a decrease in almost all twenty-six of 
the amino acids measured in nine patients with liver fail￾ure (eight of them with an HE grade of 2 or more) with 
a single FPSA session. Some of the amino acids cleared 

García Martínez and Bendjelid Ann. Intensive Care (2018) 8:109 Page 10 of 14
(such as glutamine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and trypto￾phan) have been directly implicated in the development 
of HE, suggesting that FPSA may improve this serious 
condition associated with liver failure. In another study 
involving patients with ALF monitored by cerebral 
microdialysis, the authors found the same trend in the 
removal of aromatic amino acids (especially phenylala￾nine) from the arterial blood after a single FPSA session, 
but it was surprisingly without a significant change in the 
concentrations measured in the microdialyzate [78]. It 
should be noted, in this regard, that one of the inclusion 
criteria was a high risk of intracranial hypertension, but 
the patients did not need to have clinical encephalopathy. 
On the same topic, we found an interesting paper pub￾lished by Ryska et  al. [79] that described the influence 
of Prometheus therapy on the evolution of intracranial 
pressure (ICP) in a well-conducted experimental model 
of ALF in pigs. The authors showed a significant reduc￾tion in the ICP in the group treated with FPSA compared 
to that of the control group (24 mmHg vs. 29.8 mmHg, 
respectively, 12  h after liver devascularization, p<0.05) 
again indicating the probable usefulness of Prometheus 
in HE.
On the removal of cytokines and other molecules 
involved in the development and evolution of liver fail￾ure, Rocen et  al. [80] measured the concentrations of 
cytokines, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and 
procalcitonin) and liver regeneration markers, such as 
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and α1 fetoprotein, dur￾ing FPSA sessions in eleven patients with ALF of different 
aetiologies (nine of whom were finally transplanted). The 
authors showed a significant decrease in most cytokines 
and inflammatory marker concentrations with Pro￾metheus, which contrasts the results of previous research 
[81]. Nevertheless, no clinical improvement, except for 
improvement of encephalopathy, was demonstrated. Sur￾prisingly, the HGF concentration increased significantly, 
which could favour hepatic regeneration. As with MARS, 
the ability of Prometheus to influence the cytokine pro￾file and the final clinical outcome of this action are still 
unclear and require further research.
Few clinical studies evaluating the survival or other 
clinical outcomes with Prometheus were published in 
the 2000s. A randomized controlled trial published dur￾ing this period by Laleman et  al. [81] compared SMT 
with MARS and Prometheus in patients presenting 
AoCLF, and only MARS showed benefits in some of the 
included haemodynamic variables, such as mean arterial 
pressure, stroke volume or systemic resistances. Survival 
was not assessed in this study. Dethloff et al. [82] showed 
the same tendency to improve mean arterial pressure 
only with MARS treatment in a randomized controlled 
study comparing MARS, Prometheus and conventional 
haemodialysis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. 
These different actions on haemodynamics of MARS and 
Prometheus have no obvious explanation. As described 
above, MARS and Prometheus may influence cytokine 
and inflammatory molecules concentrations, thus induc￾ing haemodynamic changes, but the final balance for 
both is unknown. Several studies have demonstrated a 
reduction in NO levels with MARS [4, 81], which is prob￾ably removed in its main circulating complexed form, 
S-nitroso-serum albumin [83], but the use of Prometheus 
probably also influences NO levels [84]. In addition, most 
of the clinical trials published so far using MARS or Pro￾metheus in AoCLF did not use haemodynamic outcomes 
and description of haemodynamic changes with treat￾ment was often not included. It should also be noted that 
haemodynamically unstable patients were systematically 
excluded in these studies.
Over the last few years, only a limited number of stud￾ies have used clinical endpoints (Table  5). The most 
important was the HELIOS study, which was published 
in 2012 by Kribben et al. [26]. This is a multicentric ran￾domized controlled trial comparing Prometheus with 
SMT in 145 patients with AoCLF, and the primary end￾point was the probabilities of survival at 28  days and 
90 days (irrespective of liver transplantation). This RCT 
scored 3 on the Oxford quality scoring system. This trial 
failed to prove a survival benefit with Prometheus in the 
overall patient population, and the patient recruitment 
was interrupted after the interim analysis (90 patients) 
due to futility (204 patients were initially planned for 
inclusion in the study). It is important to note that in the 
overall population the probability of survival was slightly 
higher in the Prometheus group compared to the SMT 
group (90-day survival probability: 47% vs. 38%) but 
without statistical significance.
Among the predefined subgroups analyzed, the sur￾vival probability of patients with more severe liver disease 
(MELD>30) treated with Prometheus was significantly 
higher than that of the patients treated with SMT alone 
(90-day survival probability: 48% vs. 9%, respectively, 
logrank p<0.05). In the subgroups of patients with less 
sever disease (MELD<20 and MELD 20–30), differences 
in survival are not statistically significant. This may indi￾cate the usefulness of Prometheus when applied to more 
severe patients, but this conclusion is strongly limited by 
the small size of the subgroups.
Some other studies, although quite heterogeneous, 
have been published in recent years. Sentürk el al. [27] 
compared the biochemical and clinical parameters dur￾ing FPSA in patients with ALF and AoCLF, demon￾strating a significant improvement in the biochemical 
parameters and in HE. Survival was not assessed in this 
study. Komardina et  al. [85] described haemodynamic 

García Martínez and Bendjelid Ann. Intensive Care (2018) 8:109 Page 11 of 14
and biochemical improvements with Prometheus in 
patients with ischaemic ALF (complication after cardiac 
surgery), but no change in the survival was shown. Sur￾prisingly, the overall mortality was very high in the study 
(only 9 of the 39 patients included were alive at day 28).
Other devices
Some new artificial devices, or modifications to currently 
used systems, have been developed in the past few years.
Marangoni et  al. [87] presented the so-called high￾efficiency MARS by inserting a double adsorption unit 
(double columns containing charcoal and another pair 
with ion-exchange resin, mounted in parallel) into the 
albumin circuit. The authors compared the detoxification 
capacity of their system with that of the “classical” MARS 
in four patients with liver failure and showed that the 
“improved” MARS was notably more effective in remov￾ing bilirubin and bile acids.
An hybrid extracorporeal protocol was presented 
by Akcan Arikan et  al. [88], which combined high￾flux CRRT for hyperammonaemia, therapeutic plasma 
exchange for coagulopathy and MARS for hepatic 
encephalopathy. They presented this protocol in a retro￾spective observational study that included fifteen paedi￾atric patients with ALF or AoCLF, who were supported 
with this therapy and showed improvement in HE.
In 2017, one experimental study by Al-Chalabi et  al. 
[89] using an animal model of ALF in pigs and one uncon￾trolled clinical trial by Huber et  al. [90] including 14 
patients with liver failure were published, both of which 
used a new device called ADVOS (ADVanced Organ 
Support). The laboratory prototype of ADVOS was first 
presented in 2013 [91] and included an extracorpor￾eal blood circuit, a dialyzate circuit containing standard 
dialyzate with a 2–4% albumin concentration and a third 
circuit where the albumin dialyzate was divided into two 
parts. Before reaching the cation and anion filters, each 
part undergoes a change in the pH value by the addition 
of acid or base and is subjected to a temperature change, 
resulting in a release of albumin-bound toxins. The 
resulting dialyzates containing toxin-free albumin join 
with each other in order to reach the desired pH before 
entering the haemodialyzer again. In the animal study 
mentioned above, all of the animals treated by ADVOS 
survived (5 out of 10), whereas the pigs treated with SMT 
died in the 10-h observation period (p<0.01). Significant 
haemodynamic and biochemical improvements were 
demonstrated with ADVOS. A significant decrease in the 
bilirubin level was also demonstrated in the clinical trial 
published by Huber et al. [90]. No further clinical studies 
on this promising technique have been published so far.
Some modifications of the techniques described above, 
such as plasma diafiltration and some protocols already 
used several years ago to treat liver failure, such as 
plasma exchange or therapeutic apheresis using a biliru￾bin adsorbent column, are also found anecdotally in the 
literature [43, 92, 93].
Conclusion
Severe liver failure is associated with high mortality, as 
many patients die despite undergoing optimal medical 
treatment. Even if liver transplantation has emerged 
as an essential therapy, many patients with this dis￾ease will unfortunately die while waiting for a hepatic 
transplant. Consequently, there is a clear need for 
a liver support system to provide a “bridge” to a final 
treatment. Over the last two decades, several artificial 
liver support systems with promised advances were

introduced. However, whether such improvements 
could be translated into survival benefit is still uncer￾tain, given the scarcity of available results of RCTs. The 
present reality is probably related to several factors, 
including the involvement of several interconnected 
organs and the fact that liver failure patients constitute 
a heterogeneous population with severe multimorbid￾ity [94]. Moreover, there is no precise recommendation 
on the effective timing of the initiation of artificial liver 
support systems. In this regard, the future prospects of 
artificial liver support systems should rely on the com￾pletion of adequately powered RCTs addressing these 
crucial clinical issues and endpoints. New indications 
for this organ support, such as post-hepatectomy liver 
failure, should also be explored. In the meantime, and 
in the absence of alternative options to support this 
vital organ, it is difficult to criticize the cautious use of 
these secured artificial liver devices as “salvage” therapy 
in patients suffering from ALF or severe AoCLF.
