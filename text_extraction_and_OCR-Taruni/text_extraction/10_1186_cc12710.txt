Introduction
Extra-vascular lung water (EVLW) is all the fl uid within 
the lungs that is present outside the vascular compart￾ment. Its clinical correlate is pulmonary oedema and it is 
a function of hydrostatic pressure and pulmonary capil￾lary permeability. In critically ill patients, high levels have 
been shown to be an independent predictor of outcome 
[1] and manipulation of the EVLW has also been shown 
to have a positive eff ect on outcome [2]. For many years 
the chest radiograph was used to diagnose changes in 
EVLW, but this has been shown to have a poor diagnostic 
accuracy [3]. Other indirect radiological esti mates of 
EVLW, such as CT scanning and MRI, are impractical in 
critically ill patients, leading to the develop ment of 
thermal dye techniques to allow more estima tion of 
EVLW at the bedside [4]. Due to the com plexity of the 
dye technique it has largely been super seded by the single 
thermo-dilution technique, which now constitutes the 
clinical gold standard of lung water estimation [5]. Th is 
technique, however, is invasive and requires regular 
calibrations, limiting its utility [6].
Traditionally the lung was not felt to be amenable to 
ultrasound due to its high air content and acoustic 
impedance; however, the description of common arte￾facts by Lichtenstein and colleagues [7] and their patho￾logical correlates on CT scanning has led to an expansion 
in the use of bedside thoracic ultrasound, culminating in 
evidence-based consensus guidelines [8]. Th ere is now an 
accumulating body of evidence that lung ultrasound 
allows a semi-quantitative estimate of lung water and, 
given its ready availability and ease of use, is a useful 
point of care tool for this estimation. Th is paper seeks to 
lay out the evidence for the use of lung ultrasound in the 
estimation of EVLW.
EVLW measurement in critically ill patients
EVLW or EVLW indexed to body weight is an impo rtant 
measure of the state of the lungs in critically ill patients 
as a high level is independently associated with a worse 
clinical outcome, including duration of mechanical venti￾lation, ICU stay and mortality, whether associated with 
acute lung injury or not [1,6,9]. It also appears that 
manipulation of the EVLW may improve outcome in 
Abstract
The estimation of extra-vascular lung water (EVLW) is 
an essential component in the assessment of critically 
ill patients. EVLW is independently associated with 
mortality and its manipulation has been shown to 
improve outcome. Accurate assessment of lung water 
is possible with CT and MR imaging but these are 
impractical for real-time measurement in sick patients 
and have been superseded by single thermal dilution 
techniques. While useful, single thermo-dilution 
requires repeated calibration and is prone to error, 
suggesting a need for other monitoring methods. 
Traditionally the lung was not thought amenable to 
ultrasound examination owing to the high acoustic 
impedance of air; however, the identifi cation of 
artefacts in diseased lung has led to increased use of 
ultrasound as a point of care investigation for both 
diagnosis and to monitor response to interventions. 
Following the initial description of B-lines in association 
with increased lung water, accumulating evidence 
has shown that they are a useful and responsive 
measure of the presence and dynamic changes in 
EVLW. Animal models have confi rmed a correlation 
with lung gravimetry and the utility of B-lines has 
been demonstrated in many clinical situations and 
correlated against other established measures of EVLW. 
With increasing availability and expertise the role of 
ultrasound in estimating EVLW should be embedded 
in clinical practice and incorporated into clinical 
algorithms to aid decision making. This review looks at 
the evidence for ultrasound as a valid, easy to use, non￾invasive point of care investigation to assess EVLW.

patients with lung injury [2]. Fluid management aimed at 
a conservative as opposed to liberal fl uid strategy was 
associated with improved oxygenation index, lung injury 
score, reduced plateau pressure and increased ventilator￾free days in a pivotal study by the ARDSnet group, 
further highlighting the importance of limiting EVLW in 
the critically ill patient population [10]. Th is was late in 
the progression of the critical illness and contrary to data 
on early goal-directed therapy, suggesting that it is not 
just the amount of fl uid but also the timing of fl uid that is 
essential in the management of critically ill patients [11].
Exploring the range of methods available to predict fl uid 
responsiveness in critically ill patients is beyond the remit 
of this article but the options for monitoring changes in 
stroke volume and cardiac output are numer ous [12-16]. 
In contrast, the devices available to monitor EVLW in 
response to changes in fl uid status are limited. With a 
reduction in use of pulmonary artery catheters and given 
the complexity of dye indicator techniques, the single 
thermal dilution technique has become the pre dominant 
technique for determination of EVLW, derived from the 
mean transit time of the thermal signal through the lungs.
While this may represent the best compromise between 
practicability (versus CT/MRI scanning) and portability, 
it requires central venous and proximal arterial catheters 
and frequent recalibration for accurate EVLW measure￾ment. Th ere may also be specifi c methodological issues 
in critically ill patients where assumptions about chamber 
ratios and the possibility of shunting and thermal sinks 
may reduce the accuracy of the results [17,18].
Given these problems and the importance of EVLW in 
this patient population, a search for more continuous, 
less invasive measurement is justifi ed. While other 
modali ties such as impedance tomography may be 
developing a role, only ultrasound gives a direct window 
on the lung.
Improvements in ultrasound technology in recent years 
have led to smaller machines and better image quality. As 
a result of this, ultrasound has moved out of the radiology 
department to become a point of care test facilitating 
both rapid diagnosis and dynamic response to inter ven￾tions. Th e role of ultrasound is now well established in 
acute settings like focused assessment with sonography 
for trauma (FAST) scanning in accident and emergency 
[19,20], echocardiogram in acute pulmonary embolism 
[21], thoracic ultrasound for pleural interventions [22] 
and for vascular access [23]. Th e evolving evidence base 
has resulted in the publication of point of care lung 
ultrasound guidelines [8]
Ultrasound lung comets, lung rockets and the 
B-line pattern
Th e discovery of ultrasound as a rapid, non-invasive and 
reproducible bedside investigative tool to assess the 
EVLW in critically ill patients is worth pursuing as in 
other similar scenarios, such as vascular access and FAST 
scanning, it has been shown to be a rapidly acquired skill. 
Th e ease of using thoracic ultrasound to measure EVLW 
was further reinforced by the 99% feasibility rate achieved 
in one of the earliest studies conducted by Lichtenstein 
and colleagues in establishing B-lines as markers of 
elevated EVLW [7].
Th e use of ultrasound has expanded further since the 
signifi cance of the ‘comet tail’ or B-line artefact was 
characterised. Lung in its healthy state is poorly pene￾trated by ultrasound due to the high acoustic impedance 
of air. In the diseased lung the acoustic impedance may 
change, allowing better penetration and resolution from 
ultrasound. In addition, artefacts may develop that can 
imply disease in the underlying lung. Aerated lung and 
lung with alveolar/interstitial oedema produce two 
distinct types of ultrasound artefacts. A repetitive hori￾zontal feature seen in aerated lung called the A-line 
(Figure 1) is replaced by a vertical narrow based artefact 
in lungs with alveolar/interstitial oedema called the B￾line or comet tail (Figure  2) [7]. Th e B-line was fi rst 
demon strated by Ziskin and colleagues in a patient with 
abdominal shotgun wound [24]. Areas of diff ering 
impedance (for example, the sub-pleural end of a 
thickened septum), while not visible in ultrasound, 
results in the beam refl ecting indefi nitely, leading to a 
ring down B-line artefact composed of all the micro￾refl ections. Lichtenstein and colleagues have shown that 
B-lines have a high sensitivity and specifi city in patients 
with diff use alveolar/interstitial oedema [7]. Since then, 
various studies have correlated the ultrasound evidence 
of elevated EVLW, that is, B-lines with radiographic and 
invasive methods of lung water estimation and hydro￾static pressure measure ments [25,26].
Nomenclature is important and in this area there are a 
wide range of terms used - B-lines, lung rockets, ultra￾sound comet tails. In recognition of this and the potential 
for confusion, a consensus document has suggested that 
the term B-line pattern be used [8].
Animal models using ultrasound to estimate EVLW
Th e ultimate gold standard for EVLW is gravimetric 
assess ment of the lungs post mortem [27]. Indeed, 
indicator dye and thermal dilution techniques have been 
validated in animal models against gravimetric methods 
showing a bias that could be off set for clinical use [17]. 
For ultrasound to be accepted as a reasonable alternative 
to other measures of EVLW it should undergo the same 
validation in animal models.
Th is validation was undertaken by Jambrik and 
colleagues in an oleic acid-induced model of acute lung 
injury (ALI) in pigs [28]. In this porcine model, oleic acid 
was administered intravenously in 12 animals to induce 
Shyamsundar et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:237

ALI while 5 animals where used as controls. Th oracic 
ultra sound was performed to detect B-lines using a 
3.5  Hz probe at the third and fi fth intercostal spaces in 
the anterior axillary line in each hemithorax. Th ere was a 
signifi cant increase in B-lines with time after oleic acid 
administration. Th ere was also a signifi cant co-relation 
between the number of B-lines at the time of animal 
sacrifi ce and wet/dry ratio by gravimetric method.
While the study by Jambrik and colleagues validated B￾lines to measure EVLW, the more clinically relevant 
question was if it could detect elevated EVLW before 
functional impairment becomes apparent. Gargani and 
colleagues in an oleic acid-induced ALI model in pigs 
studied the evolution of B-lines in relation to lung 
compliance and PaO2
/FiO2
 (partial pressure of oxygen/
fractional inspired oxygen concentration) ratios [29]. 
B-lines, compliance and PaO2
/FiO2
 ratios were measured 
every 15  minutes for a total of 90  minutes after the 
administration of oleic acid in 10 pigs while 5 pigs acted 
as control. B-lines were measured in six sites in each 
hemithorax in the third and fi fth intercostal spaces using 
a 7.5  Hz vascular probe. Mild to moderate ALI was 
demon strated in histology with a signifi cant increase in 
the wet/dry ratio in the lungs of the oleic acid adminis￾tered pigs when compared to the controls. A signifi cant 
increase in B-lines was demonstrated in this study at 
15 minutes post oleic acid administration with associated 
reduction in compliance. Th e increase in B-lines consis￾tently preceded the development of functional impair￾ment signifi ed by a fall in PaO2
/FiO2
.
Th ese data suggest that a worsening B-line pattern 
correlates well with increases in lung water but also that 
B-lines develop before overt impairment in oxygenation, 
suggesting that this may be a useful sign to detect 
increases in EVLW very early and therefore a potential 
guide to fl uid management.
Validation of B-lines outside critical care
Th ere is a wealth of data on the validity of B-line pattern 
correlating with high EVLW outside of critical care. 
Emer gency presentations with shortness of breath, 
patients with known cardiac disease, fl uid overload in the 
context of chronic haemodialysis and in situations of 
extreme physiology have all been studied with lung 
ultrasound. While critically ill patients may have some 
diff erences in the underlying pathophysiology, the princi￾ples of increased lung water are similar and are a function 
of both hydrostatic pressures and pulmonary capillary 
permeability. It is therefore pertinent to examine the data 
from these settings.
Extreme physiology
In a study of climbers in Nepal who had a clinical diag￾nosis of high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) there 
was a clear diff erence in the number of B-lines seen when 
compared to control subjects without HAPE. Indeed, 
there was a near linear correlation between the number 
of B-lines and the oxygen saturations as deter mined by 
pulse oximetry [30] and a temporal correlation with 
improvement in symptoms. Similarly, in another group of 
18 climbers in Nepal, the B-line count increased from sea 
level with increasing altitude and again showed a strong 
negative correlation with oxygen saturation, making the 
authors conclude that clinically silent HAPE occurs [31]. 
Increases in the B-line count have also been demon￾strated in elite apnoea divers who are known to suff er 
with respiratory diffi culty after dives due to centralisation

of blood fl ow from the peripheries to the pulmonary 
circulation. Th e B-line count increased signifi cantly 
following dives and normalised within 24  hours in a 
subset [32]. In 31 ‘Iron man’ competitors at sea level there 
was an increase to what was felt to be a signifi cant level in 
the B-line count in 23 of them immediately following the 
race but then decreasing 12  hours after. Th ere were 
strong correlations between the B-line count and 
measures of cardiac function, including N-terminal pro￾brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) [33].
Emergency department and acute cardiology patients
Th ere are numerous studies examining the role of B-line 
estimation in this setting (Table  1). Th e fi rst demon￾stration of the use of lung ultrasound to distinguish 
between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
and pulmonary oedema in acutely dyspnoeic patients 
was demonstrated by Lichtenstein and Meziere in 1998 
[34]. Sixty-six consecutive patients with acute dyspnoea, 
40 of whom had pulmonary oedema and 26 of whom had 
exacerbations of COPD, were studied and compared to 
80 controls. A B-line pattern was demonstrated in all the 
patients with pulmonary oedema, only two of the 
patients with COPD and one control patient, giving a 
sensitivity of 100% and specifi city of 92% [34]. Jambrik 
and colleagues [26] studied 121 patients admitted to a 
combined cardiology/pulmonology unit, performed lung 
ultrasound on admission and then compared the B-line 
count to a blinded assessment of pulmonary oedema 
from the admission chest X-ray. Th ey found a strong 
correlation between the B-line count and a validated 
radiological assessment of pulmonary oedema [26,35]. In 
a compara tive study of 72  patients, 53 with known left 
ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and 19 with normal 
LV func tion, patients underwent lung ultrasound and 
echo cardio graphy before and after exercise. Th ere were 
strong positive correlations between the B-line count and 
several measures of cardiac dysfunction, most notably 
the Echo-derived measure of pulmonary capillary wedge 
pressure [36,37]. Another analysis was performed on the 
data from a cohort of 340 patients admitted to a 
cardiology clinic in Italy [38]. Patients admitted with 
clinical features consistent with acute pulmonary oedema 
had a much higher B-line count (50 versus 20) and there 
was also a correlation between the count and New York 
Heart Association classifi cation, with higher counts being 
associated with a higher class [38]. Th e same group 
examined data on 290 patients admitted with acute 
dyspnoea or chest pain who were followed up to 
16 months and found that B-line count was the strongest 
predictor of subsequent death or cardiovascular events, 
even above the ejection fraction [39]. Comparison to 
other well validated markers of acute LV impairment, 
such as NT pro-BNP, has also been performed. In 129 
patients admitted with acute dyspnoea, a B-line count of 
greater than 4 was found to have a sensitivity of 81% and 
specifi city of 85% and a cutoff of 9 was associated with a 
sensitivity of 73% and specifi city of 100% [40]. Th e area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) was 0.893 for lung ultrasound compared to 
0.978 for NT pro-BNP [40].
Lichtenstein and Meziere [41] validated a protocol for 
assessment of acute dyspnoea patients that included a 
cohort of 64 patients with pulmonary oedema. Th ey used 
a more simplistic approach of examining the pattern of 
the anterior lung and defi ning it as either A-line pre￾ponderant or B-line preponderant. When validated against 
American Heart Association recommendations for the 
diagnosis of pulmonary oedema together with echo 
measurements, they found that anterior bilateral B-lines 
had a sensitivity of 97% and specifi city of 95% for diag￾nosing pulmonary oedema [41]. In a similar cohort of 
300 consecutive patients admitted to an emergency 
medical unit, patients underwent lung ultrasound in 
eight zones (four on either side) and the presence of 
B-lines in more than two zones was found to have a high 
sensitivity (85.7%) and specifi city (97.7%) for diagnosing 
alveolar-interstitial syndrome [42]. In a group of 81 
patients thought clinically likely to have decompensated 
heart failure, a modifi ed lung ultrasound protocol was 
performed using 11 intercostal spaces [43]. Th ere were 
positive correlations between the ultrasound B-line count 
and the radiological score, clinical score and NT pro￾BNP level. Th e B-lines resolved following treatment on 
follow-up scans [43]. More recently, the combination of 
B-lines and NT pro-BNP diff erentiated acute decom pen￾sated heart failure from both asthma and COPD in a 
group of 218 emergency department patients [44]. Using 
the combi nation gave sensitivity of 100% and specifi city 
of 100% [44].
Th ese data support the role of ultrasound in helping to 
detect increases in EVLW manifested as acute pulmonary 
oedema.
Haemodialysis patients
Patients with end stage renal failure on dialysis represent 
a stable cohort who will have signifi cant fl uid shifts 
around the time of their renal replacement therapy and 
constitute a useful cohort to study real time changes in 
fl uid status and lung water.
Noble and colleagues found that in 34 of 40 patients 
with end-stage renal failure examined pre-dialysis, at the 
mid-point and post-dialysis, there was a signifi cant 
reduction in B-lines from both pre-dialysis to mid-point 
and post-dialysis [45]. Th is has been complemented more 
recently [46] in 41 patients scanned before and after 
haemodialysis; there was a strong correlation between 
the B-line count and the accumulated weight before

treatment and that lost after dialysis. All ultrasound 
examinations in this study occurred within a 10 minute 
period, demonstrating practical, real-time changes.
Mallamaci and colleagues performed chest ultrasound 
in 75 patients before and after haemodialysis [47]. Th ey 
grouped patients into three ultrasonographic categories 
of increasingly severe pulmonary congestion (described 
as mild, <14 B-lines; moderate, 14 to 30 B-lines; severe, 
>30 B-lines) and found that B-line count signifi cantly 
reduced after dialysis. Th ey also found signifi cant corre￾lations of pre-dialysis B-lines with early left ventricular 
fi lling velocity, early fi lling to early diastolic mitral annular 
velocity ratio, pulmonary pressure, and left ventri cular 
end diastolic volume.
Th ese studies give the most convincing data on the co￾temporaneous relationship between EVLW, ultrasono￾graphic B-line measurement and hydrostatic pressures, 
supporting the role of ultrasound as a useful dynamic 
means of estimating the eff ects of changes in fl uid status 
on the lung.
Validation of B-lines in critical care
In a seminal study, Lichtenstein and colleagues [7] en￾rolled 282 consecutive patients (without pneumo thorax) 
admitted to intensive care and assessed 250 of them for 
alveolar-interstitial syndrome using conventional chest 
X-ray against ultrasound examination of the antero￾lateral chest wall. Alveolar-interstitial syndrome describes 
a heterogenous group of pathologies associated with 
increases in lung water (acute respiratory distress syn￾drome, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema). In 92  patients 
diagnosed as positive for the syndrome on chest radio￾graph, they found a pattern consistent with the syndrome 
in 86  patients using ultrasound (sensitivity of 93.4%). 
Absence of positive fi ndings on ultrasound (or confi ned 
to the last lateral intercostal space) was noted in 120 of 
129  patients with a normal chest X-ray (specifi city of 
93.0%). Whilst 29 patients were excluded owing to incon￾clu sive radiography, only 3  patients were excluded 
because of a non-diagnostic ultrasound exam. Th e 
authors concluded that this was the fi rst example in the 
literature of a relationship between the B-line pattern and 
alveolar-interstitial syndrome.
Whilst the role of the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) 
in the management of critically ill patients has been 
debated in recent years [48], the measurement of pulmo￾nary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) remains a reason￾able estimate of left heart fi lling pressures. EVLW is a 
function of this increase in pressure. A comparison 
between ultrasound fi ndings and PAOP from PAC has 
been made in 102 mechanically ventilated patients [49]. 
Ultrasound provided good correlation, distinguishing 
between dry interlobular septa (with a predominance of 
anterior A-lines on ultrasound and a low PAOP value) 
and alveolar-interstitial syndrome (with a predominance 
of anterior B-lines on ultrasound and a higher PAOP 
value). Further to this, they found B-predominance to be 
present in a wide range of PAOP values. Th us, bedside 
lung ultrasound could be used to help guide fl uid therapy. 
Ultrasound could provide a useful non-invasive surrogate 
of PAOP without the potential harm from a PAC.
Similar strong correlation has been shown with the 
PiCCO device (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, 
Germany) [50]. Agricola and colleagues [50] followed 
20  patients undergoing cardiac surgery and studied the 
assessment of interstitial pulmonary oedema, comparing 
chest ultrasound against chest radiography, PAC readings 
and the PiCCO single thermodilution method. Th ey 
reported a signifi cant positive linear correlation between 
presence of B-lines, EVLW using the PiCCO single 
thermodilution method and wedge pressure as measured 
using the pulmonary artery catheter. Th ere was also high 
sensitivity (90%) and specifi city (89%) of the negative test 
result for detection of EVLW <500  ml. Th e study did 
exclude patients with signifi cant lung pathology, reducing 
the possibility of false-positive results.
Limitations, pitfalls and future directions
Lung ultrasound is a new technique and has its limita￾tions. It is a user-dependent technique. While previous 
studies have shown good inter-observer variability, it is 
important that this is replicated in a broader clinical 
setting and that training processes and competencies are 
validated to ensure high quality assurance. It is also 
important to note that B-lines can be detected in other 
diseases such as pulmonary fi brosis, although diff erent 
spacing and artefact patterns may help to diff erentiate 
these [51]. B-line artefacts may also be aff ected by other 
dynamic changes, such as the application of positive end￾expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the respiratory cycle. 
Above all, it is vital that future research addresses the 
inconsistency of approaches to quantifying B-lines and 
attempts to examine the levels of agreement between 
these measured values against other gold standard 
techniques such as thermodilution.
Conclusion
Lung ultrasound is a readily available bedside tool and 
the correlation of B-lines with EVLW has been demon￾strated in animals, extreme environments and a range of 
clinical settings showing good sensitivity and specifi city. 
Th e presence or absence of B-lines is a useful tool for 
ruling in or ruling out pulmonary oedema and alveolar 
interstitial syndrome in the acute setting and there is 
evidence of real time matching of B-line quantity with 
changes in EVLW and total body water. Correlation 
between PAOP and B-lines in critically ill patients would 
suggest it is a useful surrogate of left sided fi lling

pressures and has a role in guiding fl uid fi lling and 
resuscitation.
Th e use of ultrasound in detecting EVLW should be 
embedded in clinical practice by the development of a 
protocol to enable its incorporation into a clinical 
practice algorithm. Th e protocol should follow the recent 
guidelines [8] to allow development and implementation 
of a standardised technique of lung ultrasound.
