Abstract
Background: Purpose of this study was to analyse the surgical management and long-term clinical outcome of
patients diagnosed with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) over a period of 10 years using data from a German
tumour registry.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of 5772 patients diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma between 2002 and
2007. Follow-up was continued until 2012.
Results: 1426 patients (24.7%) had CLM; 1019 patients (71%) had synchronous, 407 patients (29%) developed
metachronous CLM. Hepatic resection was performed in 374 of the 1426 CLM patients (26%). A significant increase
in liver resection rate from 16.6% for the 2002 cohort to 32% in later cohorts was observed. In centers specialized in
liver surgery, CLM resection rates reached 46.6%. However, up to 52% of patients diagnosed with three or less CLM
did not undergo liver surgery, although, if resected, patients with 1 CLM show a similar long-time survival as CRC
patients who do not develop any CLM. Univariate and multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, year of resection,
time of CLM diagnosis and number of CLM revealed a significant survival benefit for CLM resection (HR =0.355;
CI 0.305-0.414). Furthermore, significant impact on OS was seen for age at diagnosis, perioperative chemotherapy
and number of CLM.
Conclusions: We here present the first long-term, population-based analysis of the surgical management of CLM in
Germany. Significant increase in hepatic resection rates, translating to a significant benefit in OS, was seen over
years. However, we still see a striking potential for further improvements in interdisciplinary CLM management.

Background
Medical and surgical treatment of advanced metastatic
colorectal cancer (CRC) has undergone enormous im￾provement during the last years and is still evolving.
Accounting for 12.2% of all cancer-related deaths in
Europe, the majority of patients diagnosed with metastatic
CRC present with unresectable metastatic disease [1]. In
contrast, surgery remains the only curative approach to
colorectal liver metastases (CLM) and liver resection is
indicated in all “resectable” patients [2]. Definition of
resectabiliy however – including “manageable” margin￾negative resection, “adequate” residual perfusion and
biliary drainage as well as a minimum of 20% residual
healthy liver, remains vague and necessitates interdiscip￾linary evaluation by expert oncologists, surgeons and radi￾ologists [1,3]. Furthermore, perioperative chemotherapy
has been shown to facilitate surgery in extended meta￾static disease, to increase resectability of initially unresect￾able CLM by 7-40%, and to increase progression-free
survival in resectable CLM [1]. Single centre publications
have shown CLM resection rates of 20-45% and 5-year
survival rates after CLM resection of up to 64% [1-6].

However, single, high-volume academic centres represent
highly selected patients and the results do not always re￾flect the clinical reality. In a first population-based study
of CLM patients in Southern Germany, we had analysed
884 patients diagnosed with CRC in 2002. An overall
CLM resection rate of 19.1% was described; a higher
resection rate (28.3%) was observed in a subgroup of
patients treated in centres specialized in liver surgery.
However, a relevant undertreatment of CLM patients
was seen [7]. We therefore decided to analyse the evolu￾tion of CLM management over a period of ten years. The
present study is the first long-term analysis of 5772 pa￾tients diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma between
2002 and 2007 in Germany. Observation was continued
until 2012, resulting in a minimum follow-up of 5 years
(maximum 10 years).
Methods
Patient population and data acquisition
For the present analysis, we included all patients that were
diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma between 2002
and 2007 registered in the Tumorzentrum Regensburg
(tumor center Regensburg). This center collects epidemio￾logical and clinical information on all cancer patients in
the Southern German Regions of Upper Palatinate and
Lower Bavaria. These regions have a total population of
approximately two million inhabitants. Data was collected
from standardised cancer report sheets submitted from
care centres and oncologists as well as from archived hos￾pital discharge letters for each patient. All diagnoses were
confirmed by histology. Life-status of the patients was
ascertained using death-certificates and information from
the registration offices of the patients’ respective resident
districts. The observation time was the interval between
diagnosis of primary tumour until last follow up or death
of the patient. Cut-off date was December 2012. Patients
suffering from more than one tumour entity, i.e. another
malignancy in addition to colorectal cancer, were ex￾cluded. Data pertaining to demographics, TNM staging,
grading, histology, completeness of resection, adjuvant
treatment, localisation, time and characteristics of me￾tastases, surgical interventions, outcomes and type of
treatment institution (centre specialized in liver surgery
or regional hospital) were reviewed for each patient and
entered into a database. The study population includes
a total of 5772 patients with complete clinical records,
representing a completeness of 85%. Synchronous metas￾tasis was defined as a lesion documented simultaneously
or within 3 months of the primary diagnosis – under the
consideration that a real hepatic tumour “recurrence” that
early after primary treatment is very unlikely. A diagnosis
of metastases later than 3 months after the primary
was defined as metachronous metastasis. All collection
and retrospective analysis of patient information was
anonymized, in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki, and approved by the Bavarian Law of Cancer
Registration. Permission for data analysis was obtained
from the legal and ethical guarantors of the Regensburg
tumor center.
Statistical analysis
Overall survival (OS) time was censored at the time of
death or last follow-up with a cut-off date in December
2012 in order to have a minimum follow-up of 5 years
for each patient. Maximum follow-up, i.e. patients diag￾nosed with CRC in the year 2002, was 10 years. Median
follow-up was 7.1 years after diagnosis of the primary
(6.7 years after CLM diagnosis). Survival curves were
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard Ratios for
OS were estimated by Cox-Proportional-Hazard-Regres￾sion. Results were considered significant at p <0.05. All
statistical and descriptive analyses were performed using
SPSS software, version 19.0.
Results
Study population and occurrence of hepatic metastases
A total of 5772 patients, diagnosed with colorectal can￾cer (CRC) between January 2002 and December 2007,
were included into the present analysis (see Figure 1).
One thousand four-hundred and twenty-six patients
(=24.7%) developed hepatic metastases. Synchronous
metastases were diagnosed in 1019 patients (71.4% of
CLM patients and 17.65% of all patients), 407 patients
(28.5% of CLM patients and 7.05% of all patients) devel￾oped metachronous metastases. These relations and the
absolute numbers of patients diagnosed with CRC and
CLM per year is shown in Figure 2A. While 799 and 856
CRC patients were documented in the years 2002 and
2003, more than 1000 patients each year were documented
in 2004–2007. Rates of synchronous and metachronous
metastases remained constant in the above mentioned
range. Of all CLM, 85.3% were diagnosed within 12 months,
94.0% within 24 months and 97.5% within 36 months after
diagnosis of the primary CRC (see Figure 2B). In all cases,
CLM diagnosis was based on ultrasound plus computed
tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of all 5772 pa￾tients, comparing demographic data and primary tumour
staging of patients diagnosed with CLM and patients with￾out CLM. Among the CLM patients, 61.4% were male
and 38.6% female. Mean age at primary tumour diagnosis
was 67 years (median 68 years). The majority of primary
tumours were located in the colon (62.8%), 5.3% at the
colorectal junction and 31.9% in the rectum. All these
parameters were not significantly different in CRC pa￾tients with or without CLM. Initial UICC staging was
significantly higher in CLM patients. However, 9.1% of
CRC patients not diagnosed with hepatic metastases

initially had an UICC stage IV at primary diagnosis.
Location of non-hepatic distant metastases in these pa￾tients is shown in Additional file 1: Table S1.
The characteristics of CLM patients, comparing those
who underwent hepatic resection with patients who did
not undergo liver surgery, are presented in Additional
file 2: Table S2. Among resected CLM patients, 63.6%
were male and 36.4% female. Mean age at primary
diagnosis was 64 years (median 65 years). The majority
of primary tumours (57.2%) was located in the colon,
7.2% at the colorectal junction and 35.6% in the rectum.
Synchronous metastasis had been present in 67.6% of liver
resected patients. All of these parameters were not signifi￾cantly different to CLM patients not undergoing liver re￾section, except for age at diagnosis, which was 5 years
higher in patients without resection. UICC class IV was
significantly higher in CLM patients not undergoing liver
surgery, indicating a higher rate of non-hepatic metastasis.
Surgical approach to colorectal liver metastases
Of 1426 patients diagnosed with CLM, 383 (26.8%) pa￾tients were documented to have 3 or less hepatic me￾tastases and 729 (51.1%) patients showed more than 3
metastases. The number of hepatic lesions was not
documented in 314 patients (22%, see Additional file 3:
Table S3). These proportions remained comparable
throughout all cohorts (see Additional file 4: Table S4).
The surgical approach chosen is shown in Additional
file 3: Table S3, with the majority of patients undergo￾ing atypical liver resections. In total, 374 of the 1426
CLM patients underwent hepatic resection in curative
intent, representing an overall resection rate of 26.2%.
Hepatic resection rates increased over time from 16.6%
in 2002 to >21% in the years 2003–2005 (2003: 27.2%;
2004: 21.5%; 2005: 23.9%) to >30% after 2005 (2006:
32.4%; 2007 and later: 31.9%, see Figure 3A). A subgroup
analysis, only taking into account CLM patients with three
or less hepatic metastases, showed an overall average re￾section rate of 52.2%, increasing from 46.6% in 2002–2003
to >61% after 2005 (see Figure 3B). Hepatic resections
were performed in a total of 30 hospitals; including 2 cen￾tres specialized in liver surgery. In 197 of 374 patients
(=52.7%) undergoing liver resection, hepatic surgery was
performed in one of these two centres and an overall re￾section rate of 46.6% was documented, compared to an
overall resection rate of 22.0% in CLM patients treated in
regional hospitals (see Figure 3C).
Long-term clinical outcome
Kaplan Meier curves analysing the 10-year OS are shown
in Figures 4 and 5, results for 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-year sur￾vival are shown in Table 2. CRC patients diagnosed with
CLM showed a significantly lower 10-year OS compared
to CRC patients without liver metastases (4.6% versus
29.8%, respectively, median survival 1.7 versus 6.3 years,
p <0.001, Figure 4A and Table 2). Survival analyses in
relation to the number of hepatic metastases are shown
in Figure 4B and Table 2. Patients with three or less CLM
had a significantly longer median survival than patients
with more than three or unknown number of liver metas￾tases (median survival 2.3 years versus 1.0 years, p =0.02).
10-year OS was 15.1% in patients with 1 CLM versus 2.6%
in patients with more than three CLM, irrespective of
hepatic resection. CLM patients who underwent hep￾atic resection showed a median survival of 4.3 years
versus 1.9 years in CLM not undergoing liver resection
(p <0.001), translating into a 5-year and 10-year OS of
32.2% and 17.6% versus 4.0% and 1.1%, respectively
(see Figure 4C, Table 2). This significant benefit of hepatic
resection was especially pronounced in patients with 3 or
less metastases (5-year OS 40.6% versus 1.4%, p <0.001),
but remained significant also for patients diagnosed with
multiple or unknown number of hepatic metastases (see
Figure 5, Table 2). Notably, only 52% of patients diagnosed
with a single liver metastasis underwent hepatic resection
(see Additional file 5: Table S5, Figure 3B). This finding is
of particular importance, as patients with a single CLM
who undergo hepatic resection show a similar long-time
survival as CRC patients who do not develop any CLM
(10-year OS in resected 1 CLM patients 28.3%, in CRC pa￾tients with no CLM 29.8%, n.s.; Table 2).

In a subgroup, we analysed whether patients diagnosed
with CLM in 2005 and later years showed a difference in
long-term-survival compared to patients diagnosed with
CLM before 2005. A trend toward an improved survival
was seen (Additional file 6: Figure S1, not significant).
Perioperative chemotherapy had been given in 180
patients (48%) undergoing liver surgery for CLM. Che￾motherapeutic regimens were manifold, ranging from
5-FU monotherapy to triple chemotherapy plus targeted
therapy. In the present analysis, no significant influence
of specific chemotherapy regimen on resection rate or
clinical outcome was seen in univariate analysis (data
not shown). However, multivariate analysis adjusted for
age, sex, year of liver resection, time of CLM after diag￾nosis of the primary tumour and number of hepatic le￾sions, showed a significant benefit on overall survival
for perioperative chemotherapy for CLM (hazard ratio
0.606, 95%-CI 0.540-0.681, see Table 3).
In multivariate analysis, the parameter “hepatic resec￾tion” translated into a significant benefit on OS (hazard
ratio 0.355, 95%-CI 0.305-0.414). Significant impact on OS
was also seen for age at diagnosis and number of CLM.
No significant influence on OS was seen for the parame￾ters sex, year of resection, and time of CLM diagnosis
after primary tumour (metachronous vs synchronous, see
Table 3).
Discussion
Surgical resection represents the only potentially cura￾tive approach to colorectal liver metastases [1,2]. During
the past years, enormous improvements in both, surgical
technique and perioperative chemotherapeutic treatment

options, have increased CLM resection rates to 20 - 45%
and five-year survival after hepatic resection to up to
64% in selected, single-centre analyses [2]. However,
these results are obtained from highly selected and ideally
monitored patients and do not reflect clinical reality.
Therefore, we decided to analyse the surgical management
and long-term clinical outcome of CLM patients using
data from a German tumour registry over a period of ten
years.
In the present study, a total of 5772 patients diagnosed
with CRC were analysed. In 2002 and 2003, respectively
799 and 856 patients with complete records were ana￾lysed, representing a completeness of 80%. Increased
and constant numbers of patients analysed in later years
do represent a completeness rate of >90%. CLM were
diagnosed in 24.7% of CRC patients. This rate is at
the lower range as compared to previously published
population-based analyses as well as single-centre publica￾tions [3,5,6,8-13]. Furthermore, our rate of synchronous
metastases is at the higher range as compared to other
population-based studies using the same definition
[5,8-13]. We therefore assume a slight deficit in complete￾ness of documented metachronous CLM in our tumour
registry. 94% of CLM are diagnosed within 24 months of
primary diagnosis, explaining the constant CLM rates
until 2009, i.e. 24 months after study entry of the last
patients.
Although definition of resectability does no longer
include number of hepatic metastases, we assume that the
majority of patients diagnosed with 3 or less CLM would
be considered to be resectable. Surprisingly, only 52.2% of
these patients underwent liver resection, indicating a high
potential for further improvement in surgical therapy in
this subgroup. However, a significant increase in resection
rate in this subgroup from 46.6% in 2002/2003 to 61.8%
in 2006 and later years was observed. Overall resection
rate of CLM was 26.2%, which compares favourably to
other population-based as well as single-centre analyses
[5,8-13]. Over time, a significant increase in resection
rates from 16.6% in the 2002 cohort to >21% in the
2003–2005 cohorts to >30% in cohorts after 2005 was
observed. In 2006, certification of comprehensive colo￾rectal cancer centres was initialized by the German
Cancer Society. During the study period, 8 of all 30 hos￾pitals being part of the present analysis have been certi￾fied as colorectal cancer centres. The increase in CLM
resection rates may in part reflect the implication of
standard operating procedures during interdisciplinary
management of CRC patients treated in certified cen￾tres. These standards include mandatory discussion of

the surgical options of each individual patient by com￾prehensive tumour-board meetings.
A subgroup of 423 CLM patients (29.7%) in the
present study were treated in one of two academic cen￾tres specialized in liver surgery, which is a lower rate
than in comparable population-based analyses [5,7-13].
Of those 423 patients treated in academic centres, 197
(46.6%) underwent liver resection, compared to a resec￾tion rate of 22% in regional hospitals. The higher resection
rate of patients treated in centres specialized for liver sur￾gery is consistent with data published from large academic
single-institution studies and may reflect selection and
referral bias, but may also indicate that more resectable
patients really underwent surgery in these two centres
[1,3]. Nevertheless, a resection rate of 46.6% is at the
higher range as compared to selected, single-centre ana￾lyses [1,2]. Together with the increase in hepatic resection
rates over time in the present study as well as the number
of still unresected CLM patients, especially in those
patients diagnosed with three or less CLM, we here show
for the first time a pronounced improvement in surgical
management of CLM over time in Germany, but also a
still striking potential for further increases in hepatic re￾section rates.
Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated – as expected -
that patients without CLM had a significantly better
5-year and 10-year OS than CLM patients. In CLM
patients, the number of metastases, irrespective of hep￾atic resection, was a significant factor for long-term OS.
Long-term OS in CLM patients was significantly increased
by liver resection, which was most pronounced in patients
diagnosed with a singular hepatic lesion, but remained
significant also for patients diagnosed with multiple
CLM. Survival curves plateaued at 8–9 years after
CLM diagnosis, thus being in line with the definition
of “cure” from CLM published by Tomlinson and col￾leagues [14]. Cure rates from CLM of 17 to 25% have
been published and ongoing trials evaluating peri￾operative triple-chemotherapy combined with targeted
therapy for CLM patients report of 5-year survival
rates of up to 64% [2]. Thus, our survival data are in
line with previously published population-based and
single-centre analyses.
Intraoperative ablative therapies in combination with
curative resection have been applied in 24 patients of
the present series (10 thermal ablations, 12 radiofrequency
ablations, 2 cryotherapies). Previous studies have sug￾gested that ablation of liver metastasis leads to more
frequent and quicker liver recurrence [15]. Since the
number of patients treated with a combined resection/
ablation approach was very small, no subgroup analyses
of recurrence-free or overall survival could be performed
in the present series.
The timing of the resection of synchronous liver metas￾tasis is a focus of international discussion. Some experts
recommend simultaneously resecting the primary colorec￾tal cancer and the CLM, others recommend staged resec￾tion with the primary tumor resected first and finally
others recommend a “liver-first” approach with resection
of the CLM first, followed by resecting the primary tumor
in a following surgery [16]. In our series, 253 of 374
hepatic resections were performed in patients diagnosed
with synchronous liver metastases. Of these 253 patients,
134 received resection of hepatic metastases and primary
tumor during a simultaneous approach. In these cases,
metastatic tumor burden could be controlled by atypical
or segmental hepatic resection. Only 5 patients diagnosed
with synchronous hepatic metastases underwent a “liver￾first” approach, the remaining 114 patients received the
“classic approach”, starting with the resection of the pri￾mary tumor. The rationale for this approach, e.g. bowel
obstruction or bleeding caused by the primary tumor,
remained unknown. Comparing the long-term clinical
outcome of patients treated with the liver-first approach
versus “classic approach” would be of high interest. Recent
publications have discussed the liver-first approach as pre￾ferred treatment, since the long-term prognosis is more
determined by controlling metastatic disease and hepatic
resectability may be jeopardized by prior colorectal surgery
[16]. Furthermore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to
liver-first hepatic resection may select patients benefiting
most from curative surgery [16]. Due to the very limited
number of liver-first resected patients, we cannot provide a
statistically relevant result in this regard.

Univariate and multivariate analysis, adjusted for age, sex, year of resection,
time after primary tumour and number of metastasis, revealed significant OS
benefit for CLM resection (HR =0.355).
In multivariate analysis, significant impact on OS was seen for age at
diagnosis, number of CLM, and chemotherapeutic treatment. No significant
influence on OS was seen for the parameters sex, year of resection, time of
CLM diagnosis after primary tumour (metachronousvs synchronous). p = Level
of significance, HR = Hazard ratio, CI =95% confidence interval.

In the present study, perioperative chemotherapy was
given in 180 CLM patients (48%) undergoing hepatic
resection. However, chemotherapeutic regimens were
manifold, ranging from 5-FU monotherapy to triple
chemotherapy plus targeted therapy. Furthermore,
timing of perioperative chemotherapy as neoadjuvant,
adjuvant, or combined neo-/ and adjuvant regimens in
relation to liver resection as well as total duration of
chemotherapy was diverse and no significant influence
of chemotherapy on resection rate or survival was seen
in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis however
showed a significant benefit of perioperative chemother￾apy for CLM. Perioperative chemotherapy for CLM is a
highly relevant research focus and has been shown to in￾crease resectability of initially unresectable CLM by 7-40%
[1]. An international expert panel recommends chemo￾therapy for all patients diagnosed with unresectable CLM,
followed by surgery as soon as resectability may occur [3].
The most efficient chemotherapy is presently studied in
multiple randomized clinical trials. The CRYSTAL and
OPUS trials showed significantly increased resection rates
of CLM after treatment with Folfiri, respectively Folfox,
combined with the targeted agent Cetuximab [17]. The
CELIM trial, cross-comparing Folfox plus cetuximab
versus Folfiri plus cetuximab, showed resection rates of
CLM of 40-43% with no significant difference comparing
both regimens [18]. Ongoing clinical trials evaluate the
triple chemotherapeutic approach Folfoxiri combined with
single or dual targeted agents [18-20]. Expert consensus
recommends neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable
CLM with more than one of the poor prognostic factors
multiple metastases, size of CLM >5 cm, synchronous
CLM, lymph-node positive primary CRC or high tumor
markers [3].
We interpret our trend of an improved survival of
CLM patients diagnosed after 2005 compared to CLM
patients diagnosed 2002–2005 to be partly caused by the
above mentioned CRC centre certification, partly caused
by improved hepatic surgery and last but not least by
advances in perioperative chemotherapy.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the present study is the first large and
long-term analysis of the incidence, the management
and outcome of CLM patients in Germany. We show a
pronounced increase in CLM resection over time. How￾ever, we also reveal a relevant surgical under-treatment of
CLM. Certification of colorectal cancer centres after 2006,
implicating region-wide standard operating procedures
with interdisciplinary management of CRC patients, may
in part explain the significant increase in CLM resection
rates. However, there is still a striking potential for further
improvements of interdisciplinary treatment of patients
diagnosed with metastatic CRC.
