Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly prevalent in patients with chronic systolic heart failure. Therefore,
evidence-based therapies are more and more being used in patients with some degree of renal dysfunction.
However, most pivotal randomized clinical trials specifically excluded patients with (severe) renal dysfunction. The
benefit of these evidence-based therapies in this high-risk patient group is largely unknown. This paper reviews data
from randomized clinical trials in systolic heart failure and the interactions between baseline renal dysfunction and
the effect of randomized treatment. It highlights that most evidence-based therapies show consistent outcome
benefit in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (stage 3 CKD), whereas there are very scarce data on patients
with severe (stage 4 to 5 CKD) renal insufficiency. If any, the outcome benefit might be even greater in stage 3 CKD
compared with those with relatively preserved renal function. However, prescription of therapies should be
individualized with consideration of possible harm and benefit, especially in those with stage 4 to 5 CKD where
limited data are available. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;63:853–71) ª 2014 by the American College of Cardiology

Most randomized controlled trials in chronic heart failure
(HF) systematically excluded patients with severe renal
dysfunction, often because of concern that the investiga￾tional treatment might cause further deterioration in kidney
function. Yet these patients are at particularly high risk of
adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and might have much
to gain from evidence-based therapies, if tolerated. Inter￾national guidelines also express caution about the use of
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in patients
with renal impairment, advising restriction of the use of
ACEi and MRAs to those with estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) >30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (1,2). Heart
failure patients with renal dysfunction are undertreated with
respect to disease-modifying therapies, probably as a result
of their exclusion from trials and the caution expressed in
guidelines (3). There have been a few small clinical trials in
patients with end-stage renal disease with and without HF,
but most did not investigate major fatal or nonfatal clinical
events (4). In this review, we analyze whether there is evi￾dence (or not) that the key disease-modifying therapies used
in HF are of benefit in patients with renal dysfunction.
Classification of Chronic Kidney Disease and
Prevalence of Renal Dysfunction and
Albuminuria in HF
The distribution of eGFR and prevalence of the different
stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general
population and in patients with heart failure with reduced
(HFREF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is pre￾sented in Table 1 (5,6). In both HFREF and HFPEF,
renal dysfunction determined by reduced GFR is more
prevalent compared with the general population. Patients

with mild CKD (Kidney Dis￾ease Outcomes Quality Initiative
[KDOQI] stage 1 and 2) have,
generally, not been excluded from
clinical trials and represent ap￾proximately one-third of patients
included in randomized con￾trolled trials. Similarly, approxi￾mately 30% to 35% of patients
enrolled in recent clinical trials in
HF had moderately severe (stage 3)
CKD, although patients with
severe renal dysfunction (stage 4
CKD) were usually excluded,
except in studies in truly elderly
patients where a greater propor￾tion of patients (40% to 57%)
had stage 3 to 4 CKD, in keep￾ing with cohort studies and regis￾tries (7–12). Importantly, the
KDOQI stages are not only
dependent on eGFR but also
require evidence of kidney dam￾age (proteinuria or albuminuria)
in stages 1 and 2 where eGFR is
relatively preserved. Although
just over 10% of the general
population have albuminuria,
approximately one-third of pa￾tients with both HFREF and
HFPEF have increased urinary
albumin excretion (Table 1), and
this has been linked to adverse clinical outcome. These data
come from CHARM (Candesartan in Heart Failure:
Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity) and
GISSI-HF (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvi￾venza dell’Insufficienza cardiac Heart Failure) trials (see the
Online Appendix for a list of all trial acronyms), where none
of the randomized treatments (candesartan, rosuvastatin or
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) showed a reduction in the
level of urinary albumin excretion (13,14). On the basis of
KDOQI recommendations, classification of CKD should
take into account both eGFR and extent of albuminuria.
The pathophysiology of concomitant cardiorenal failure has
been reviewed extensively (15). Figure 1 gives a simplified
overview of possible cardiorenal interactions and where each
of the therapies that will be discussed could influence these
associations.
Single Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System
Blockade: ACE Inhibitors
Moderate renal dysfunctiondstage 3 CKD: eGFR 30 to
59 ml/min/1.73 m2
. In the first major ACEi trial in pa￾tients with severe HF, the CONSENSUS (Cooperative
North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study) trial
(enalapril; target dose 20 mg b.i.d., achieved 18.4 mg daily),
most patients probably had a reduced GFR, because the
mean serum creatinine (sCr) was 1.45  0.05 mg/dl (128 
4 mmol/l), corresponding to an eGFR of approximately 47
ml/min/1.73 m2 (on the basis of mean characteristics)
(Table 2). In a subgroup analysis with patients stratified
above and below the median sCr value 1.39 mg/dl (123
mmol/l, eGFR 49 ml/min/1.73 m2
), enalapril significantly
improved outcome in patients with worse renal function but
not in those with better renal function, although no formal
interaction analysis was performed (16). By contrast, another
substudy showed that although there was a significant
relative risk reduction of 45% in patients with sCr 140
mmol/l (1.58 mg/dl) (p ¼ 0.01), this effect was smaller
(39%) and not significant in patients with sCr >140 mmol/l,
although again no interaction analysis was performed (17).
In the SOLVD Treatment (Studies of Left Ventricular
Dysfunction Treatment) trial, enalapril (target dose 10 mg
b.i.d., achieved 16.6 mg daily) significantly reduced the
occurrence of CV death and HF hospital stays in the sub￾group of patients with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2
. There
was no interaction between the beneficial effect of enalapril
on mortality and morbidity and baseline eGFR (dichoto￾mized at 60 ml/min/1.73 m2
) (18). In the ATLAS
(Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival)
trial, which showed better outcomes with high- compared
with low-dose lisinopril, there was no significant interaction
between baseline sCr stratified at 1.5 mg/dl and the effect of
treatment (19). In the SAVE (Survival and Ventricular
Enlargement) study, which included patients with left ven￾tricular (LV) dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI),
baseline eGFR dichotomized at 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 did not
modify the beneficial effect of captopril on mortality and CV
mortality/morbidity (20).
Severe renal dysfunctiondstage 4 and 5 CKD: eGFR
<30 ml/min/1.73 m2
. In the CONSENSUS trial, few
patients (estimated 12%) with severe renal dysfunction (i.e.,
creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) were included (16,21). As
mentioned in the preceding text, the subgroups of patients
with sCr >140 mmol/l (eGFR <43 ml/min/1.73 m2
) did
show a reduction in events, but this was not statistically
significant, which was probably due to the low number
(n ¼ 76) of patients. In the absence of an interaction anal￾ysis, it is likely that the overall effect of enalapril in the
CONSENSUS trial also applied to this patient group
(16,17). In the SOLVD Treatment study, the beneficial
effect of enalapril was not affected by adjusting for baseline
eGFR (18). In patients with an eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2
(11% of patients), enalapril reduced both the risk of CV and
HF hospital stays to the same extent as in other patients.
However, an analysis of the effect of treatment in patients
with an eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 was not reported.
There is reasonable and consistent evidence of im￾provement in outcome with ACEi in patients with HF (or
LV systolic dysfunction after MI) and stage 3 CKD (Table 3).
It is possible that ACEi are also of benefit in patients with

should be taken to monitor renal function and electrolytes in
these patients to achieve optimal benefit-risk ratio.

Stage 3 CKD. In the recent HEAAL (Heart failure

(50 mg daily) doses of losartan were evaluated, eGFR
dichotomized at 75 ml/min/1.73 m2 did not modify the
beneficial effects of higher-dose losartan (22). In the

treatment in this population was similar across CKD
subgroups (unpublished data). Studies on ARB versus
ACEi therapy in patients with HF or LV dysfunction
after MI have not reported renal subgroup analyses
(23–26).
Stage 4 and 5 CKD. There are no data available on ARBs
as single renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)-
blockade in stage 4 and 5 CKD.
There is limited evidence for the use of single ARB
therapy in patients with stage 3 CKD, whereas there is an
absence of data on the effect of ARB in severe renal
dysfunction.

Stage 3 CKD. In Val-HeFT (Valsartan Heart Failure
Trial), valsartan (target dose 160 mg b.i.d., achieved dose
254 mg daily) reduced the composite mortality-morbidity
endpoint but not the co-primary all-cause mortality
endpoint. This benefit of treatment was consistent when
baseline eGFR was dichotomized at 60 ml/min/1.73 m2
(Table 4) (27). Similarly, in the CHARM-Added trial, the

significant interaction between baseline eGFR and this
beneficial effect of candesartan (unpublished data). In
contrast, in patients post-MI or at high CV risk, addition of
an ARB to an ACEi does not improve outcome and might
cause deterioration of renal function (29).
Stage 4 and 5 CKD. One study in hemodialysis patients
with HF assessed the effect of addition of an ARB to
standard therapy (100% ACEi, 60% beta-blocker, 50%
digoxin) on outcome (30). In that small trial (332 patients),
telmisartan (target dose 80 mg daily, achieved dose 75 mg
daily) significantly improved the primary endpoint of all￾cause mortality as well as the secondary endpoints of HF
hospital stay or CV mortality.
Add-on ARB therapy should be considered in patients
with chronic HF who do not tolerate an MRA, even if they
have stage 3 CKD. Data in stage 4 to 5 CKD are limited to 1
study in hemodialysis patients but, in that study, did
demonstrate benefit. Care should be taken to monitor renal
function and electrolytes in a similar fashion as ACEi therapy.
Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists
Stage 3 CKD. In RALES (Randomized Aldactone Eval￾uation Study) (target dose 50 mg daily, achieved 26 mg daily),
a total of 48% of patients had eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2
(Table 5) (31). In an interaction analysis, spironolactone
improved outcome irrespective of renal function (32). The
EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-Acute Hospitalization and
Survival Study in Heart Failure) trial enrolled patients with a
reduced ejection fraction and evidence of HF (or diabetes
mellitus) after recent MI (33). There was an interaction
between baseline sCr and the effect of treatment on all-cause
mortality, whereby eplerenone was not associated with
improved outcome in patients with sCr above 1.10 mg/dl.
However, there was no such interaction for the co-primary
endpoint of CV death or hospital stay. The most
convincing and latest evidence comes from the recent
EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitali￾zation and Survival Study in Heart Failure) trial, where 33%
of patients had eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (7). The effect
of eplerenone (target dose 50 mg daily, achieved 39 mg daily)
on the primary composite endpoint of HF hospital stay or
CV death was consistent in patients dichotomized at an
eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2
.
Stage 4 and 5 CKD. There are no data available on MRA
therapy in patients with HF and stage 4 and 5 CKD, and
eplerenone is contraindicated in patients with stage 4 and
5 CKD.
There is convincing evidence for a significant treatment
benefit with the use of MRA in the setting of HF with
moderate renal dysfunction (stage 3 CKD), but no data are
available in stage 4 and 5 CKD.
Beta-Blockers
Stage 3 CKD. Despite the absence of robust evidence
that beta-blockers worsen renal function, trials in HF have

excluded patients with severe kidney dysfunction, possibly
because of concerns about reduced renal excretion of cer￾tain drugs (Table 6). In theMERIT-HF (Metoprolol CR/XL
Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure)
study, the beneficial effect of metoprolol (target dose 200 mg
daily, achieved 159 mg daily) on clinical outcome was con￾sistent across the eGFR categories examined (eGFR <45,
45 to 60, and >60 ml/min/1.73 m2
) (34). Significant in￾teractions were found between metoprolol therapy and base￾line eGFR: the effect of metoprolol was more pronounced in
patients with eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2
. The CIBIS-II
(Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II) trial showed that
the beneficial effect of bisoprolol (target dose 10 mg daily,
achieved 8.6 mg daily) was present across all categories of
eGFR. Numerically, all-cause mortality did not improve in
patients with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2
, but there was
no significant treatment interaction (35). In the SENIORS
(Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes
and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure) trial the
effect of nebivolol (target dose 10 mg daily, achieved dose
7.7 mg daily) in patients with reduced eGFR was not different
from the effect in patients with eGFR above 60 ml/min/
1.73 m2 (36). Finally, a meta-analysis of the effect of carvedilol
in the COPERNICUS (Carvedilol Prospective Randomized
Cumulative Survival) and CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post
Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction) trials showed that
this beta-blocker significantly improved outcome in patients
with eGFR between 45 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m2
. There was
no interaction between the effect of carvedilol treatment and
eGFR categories (<45 vs. 45 to 60 ml/min/1.73 m2
) (37).
Stage 4 and 5 CKD. Data from both the MERIT-HF and
CIBIS-II trials suggest that beta-blockers are clearly effec￾tive in patients with eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 (34,35).
Especially in the MERIT-HF study, the metoprolol/pla￾cebo hazard ratio was 0.41 (95% confidence interval: 0.25 to
0.68) in the 493 patients with eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2
(12% of the whole study population). This subgroup had a
mean eGFR of 36.6  6.8 ml/min/1.73 m2
, which included
patients with eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2
. In the SE￾NIORS study, only 3.1% of patients had stage 4 CKD, but
no subgroup analysis has been performed on these patients.
As described earlier, in a meta-analysis of the CAPRI￾CORN and COPERNICUS studies, there was no signifi￾cant interaction between baseline eGFR and the effect of
carvedilol, suggesting that carvedilol might improve out￾come irrespective of renal function (37). However, only 8%
of all patients in these studies had stage 4 CKD. In 1 small
trial in hemodialysis patients with HF, carvedilol signifi￾cantly improved the secondary combined endpoint of all￾cause mortality and CV death (38).
Large subgroup analyses from landmark trials have shown
clear mortality and morbidity benefit for beta-blocker
therapy in the general HF population with stage 3 CKD,
and it seems likely that beta-blockers improve outcome
in HF patients with severe renal dysfunction (stage 4 and
5 CKD).
Digoxin
Stage 3 CKD. Only 1 landmark placebo-controlled ran￾domized trial, the DIG (Digitalis Investigation Group)
study, examined the effects of adding digoxin (target dose
individually determined, median achieved dose 0.25 mg
daily, with 1% taking 0.5 mg daily) to treatment with a
diuretic and ACEi in patients with HFREF (Table 7) (39).
Shlipak et al. (40) examined whether baseline renal function
modified the effect of digoxin and showed that the effect of
this treatment was consistent across 3 eGFR categories
studied (i.e., <30, 30 to 60, and >60 ml/min/1.73 m2
).
Stage 4 and 5 CKD. There was no interaction between
baseline renal function and the effect of digoxin in 218 pa￾tients with stage 4 CKD in the DIG study. Moreover,
in another analysis of the DIG study, digoxin reduced mor￾tality in 289 patients with sCr >2.0 mg/dl, with a significant
interaction between the effect of digoxin and baseline sCr,
with a stronger effect of digoxin in patients with higher
baseline sCr (40). Given the renal excretion of digoxin and the
risk of digoxin intoxication especially in renal insufficiency,
careful monitoring or renal function and especially potassium,
in addition to digoxin concentration monitoring, is indicated
with the use of digoxin. This is supported by findings in the
DIG study, where patients with eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2
were treated with the lowest doses of digoxin but still had the
highest serum digoxin levels.
Digoxin might be considered in patients with stage 3 to 5
CKD, with careful monitoring of digoxin concentrations
and electrolytes.
Ivabradine
The effect of ivabradine on mortality and morbidity in
patients with LV systolic dysfunction was studied in 2
studies (SHIFT [Systolic Heart failure treatment with
the IF inhibitor ivabradine Trial] and BEAUTIFUL
[Morbidity-mortality Evaluation of the If inhibitor ivab￾radine in patients with coronary disease and left-ventricular
dysfunction] trials), but a renal subgroup analysis has not
been published in either (Table 7) (41,42). Considering
the pharmacological effect of ivabradine, it is unlikely to
cause deterioration in renal function, and because renal
clearance accounts for 20% of ivabradine clearance, there
is no need for dose adjustment in patients with renal
impairment, although there are no data in patients with
creatinine clearance <15 ml/min.
Hydralazine and Isosorbide-Dinitrate
No renal subgroup analyses are available from the V-HeFT
(Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial) studies (43,44). A-HeFT
(African-American Heart Failure Trial), in African￾American HF patients, did not show significant interac￾tion between a history of “renal insufficiency” and the effect
of hydralazine and isosorbide-dinitrate (H-ISDN) therapy

(target dose 225 mg hydralazine/120 ISDN, achieved dose
in 68%) (44).
Diuretics
Diuretics are indicated in patients with symptoms and/or
signs of congestion (1,2). Current guidelines advocate using
the minimum dose necessary to achieve “dry weight” and to
reduce the dose, if possible, so as to prevent dehydration
and deterioration in renal function. Paradoxically, it has
recently been recognized that diuretics might improve renal
function if there is renal venous congestion, emphasizing
that diuretic needs might change according to the clinical
status of patients and that dose should be fine-tuned on an
individual basis (45). No specific data are available that show
improvement in outcome in patients with HF and
renal impairment, and only 1 small meta-analysis showed a
possible prognostic benefit of loop diuretics in the general
HF population. There is also a call for a shift toward novel
loop diuretics such as torsemide, because small randomized
trials might suggest improvement in clinical outcome, but
to date the pooling of studies does not suggest improved
outcome in the entire HF population (46–48). Therefore,
start and titration of diuretic therapy is dependent on
individual patient characteristics, including vital signs,
symptoms, and signs of congestion and baseline renal
function.
Implantable-Cardioverter Defibrillator Therapy
Approximately 8 trials examined the role of implantable￾cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy for primary (49–52)
and secondary (53–56) prevention of fatal ventricular
arrhythmia in ischemic and nonischemic populations
(Table 8). Although renal dysfunction was not an exclusion
criterion in these trials, baseline renal function was reported
only in the MADIT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator
Implantation Trial), MADIT II (Multicenter Automatic
Defibrillator Implantation Trial II), and SCD-HeFT
(Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial) (Table 8)
(49,50,52). Only 1 subgroup analysis has been published
looking at patients with stage 3 CKD. This subgroup
analysis from the MADIT II study showed beneficial
effects of ICD therapy in all patients, including those with
eGFR between 35 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m2
, without evi￾dence of significant interaction between ICD therapy and
renal function (57). Numerically, the beneficial effect of
ICD therapy was not observed in 80 patients with eGFR
<35 ml/min/1.73 m2
. However, the interaction between
baseline eGFR and the effect of ICD therapy was not sta￾tistically different, suggesting that the overall effect of the
study also applied to this specific patient cohort (57).
Patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD were not excluded from
ICD trials, and the treatment effect seems independent of
renal function. Therefore these patients should be consid￾ered for ICD therapy.
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy
Stage 3 CKD. The landmark CARE-HF (Cardiac
Resynchronization Heart Failure) trial provides the best
data on the effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy
(CRT) in patients with stage 3 CKD (Table 9) (58). Over￾all, CRT led to a 37% relative risk reduction in all-cause
mortality in the CARE-HF trial. There was no interaction
between baseline GFR and the effect of treatment (i.e.,
CRT led to a relative risk reduction in mortality of 33% in
patients with CKD). In patients with milder symptoms and
stage 3 CKD in the MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic
Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchroniza￾tion) trial, the benefit of CRT-D, compared with an ICD,
was similar to that in the entire population, with no inter￾action between renal function and effect of treatment
(59,60). In the RAFT (Resynchronization Defibrillation for
Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial), CRT improved outcome
in patients with and without CKD, without a significant
interaction between baseline renal function and the effect of
treatment (61). Importantly, almost 50% of patients had
eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the RAFT and MADIT￾CRT studies, suggesting that the overall findings are
generalizable. From a pathophysiological perspective, CRT
improves cardiac output and thereby probably improves
renal perfusion and function (62). This was confirmed in a
systematic review of CRT in CKD, where CRT not only
improved eGFR but also clinical outcome (63).
Stage 4 and 5 CKD. Although patients with a sCr
>3.0 mg/dl were excluded from the MADIT-CRT and
MIRACLE (Multicenter InSync Randomized Clinical
Evaluation) trials, a large proportion had CKD, defined as
an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (as did many in the CARE￾HF (Cardiac Resynchronization Heart Failure) and RAFT
studies), meaning that some patients with stage 4 and 5
CKD were included in these trials (59,64). However, the
effect of therapy in these patients has not been reported
(58,59,61,64).
There is convincing evidence for the use of CRT therapy
in patients with mild to severe HF and stage 3 CKD,
whereas there are no specific data on the effect of CRT in
stage 4 to 5 CKD.
Absolute and Relative Risk Reduction in Patients
With Stage 3 to 5 CKD
Because patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD have much higher
rates of death and hospital stay than patients with little or
no renal dysfunction, the absolute risk reduction with the
treatments discussed earlier is potentially much greater in the
former patients. For instance, in the MERIT-HF study, the
absolute risk reductions with metoprolol in patients with
an eGFR >60, 45 to 60, and <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 for all￾cause mortality were 2.5%, 3.95%, and 12.6%, respectively.
This resulted in a number needed to treat for 18 months of
40, 26, and 8 to prevent 1 death for each eGFR category.

Safety of Evidence-Based Therapies in HF Patients
With Renal Dysfunction
RAAS-inhibitors: worsening renal function. Physicians
are often concerned that initiation of an ACEi, ARB, or
MRA will lead to deterioration in renal function, and indeed
an increase in sCr often occurs, although it is usually small
(32,65–68). This concern might be amplified by the per￾ception that worsening renal function (WRF) is associated
with increased mortality in patients with HF, although this
is not entirely correct, as explained in the following (69).
During initiation of an ACEi or ARB, between 10% and
35% of patients experience some increase in sCr (Table 10).
In the CONSENSUS trial, the incidence of a substantial
increase in sCr (30% to 100%) was 24%, whereas 11% even
had more than doubling of sCr (70). Early WRF occurred
in as much as 10% of patients in the SOLVD studies (66).
In the CHARM program, the incidence of doubling of
sCr was higher in the candesartan (5.5% to 7%) than in
the placebo groups (1.6% to 6%) (71,72). In head-to-head
comparisons, the risk of WRF is similar with ARBs as
with ACEi, and the frequency of WRF is higher on higher￾dosage regimens of ARB or ACEi (19,24,26,73). The effect
of MRAs on change in eGFR in clinical trials showed
similarities with that observed in trials with ACEi and
ARBs. After an initial fall in eGFR, the gradual decline in
renal function over time with an MRA runs parallel to
that in the placebo group (67). In clinical trials at least, the
incidence of clinically important renal dysfunction seems to
have been similar in the placebo and MRA group (e.g.,
approximately 2% in the EMPHASIS-HF trial) (7).
Recently, it has become clear that deterioration in renal
function induced by inhibition of the RAAS does not have
the same adverse prognostic implications as other types of
WRF in HF. For example, WRF after initiation of enalapril
in the SOLVD trial did not confer increased risk of death,
compared with an increase in creatinine in the placebo group
(66). Even in the CONSENSUS trial, where most patients
experienced an increase in creatinine with enalapril, ACE
inhibition led to a striking improvement in survival (68).
Similarly, in the RALES trial, spironolactone caused more
WRF than placebo, but WRF was not associated with worse
outcome in the spironolactone group, in contrast to WRF
occurring in the placebo group (32).
Clearly, however, an extreme deterioration in renal
function is not acceptable and is dangerous. However, the
exact degree of WRF that should mandate dose-reduction or
discontinuation of RAAS blockade is uncertain. From the
large clinical trials, a decrease in eGFR of even 20% to 30%
with ACEi, ARB, or MRA therapy with these treatments
does not seem to attenuate the reduction in CV event rates.
Therefore it seems that, although WRF (in these magni￾tudes) is unwanted, it should not be a reason to withhold or
discontinue therapy. The latest guidelines suggest that an
increase in creatinine of up to 50% above baseline or to an
absolute 266 mmol/l (3 mg/dl)/eGFR <25 ml/min/1.73 m2
,
whichever is the smaller, is acceptable (1,2). If sCr increases
with a RAAS blocker, nephrotoxic drugs should be stopped
if possible and/or the dose of the diuretic reduced. If these
interventions are not relevant, not possible, or have no effect
and renal function deteriorates to the extent described in
the preceding text, the dose of the RAAS-inhibitor should
be halved and sCr checked within 2 weeks. If the sCr
increases by >100% or to >310 mmol/l (3.5 mg/dl)/eGFR
<20 ml/min/1.73 m2
, RAAS blockade should be stopped.
Other therapies. Beta-blockers have little if any effect on
renal function in patients with HF. An analysis from the
SOLVD trial indicated that beta-blocker treatment at base￾line was associated with a reduced risk of deterioration in renal
function during follow-up, although this was an observational
analysis, and patients had not been randomized to a beta￾blocker or placebo (74). As discussed earlier, diuretics can
cause hypotension, dehydration, and renal dysfunction (75).
Therefore, diuretic dose should be altered on the basis of in￾dividual symptoms, signs, and electrolytes, including renal
function. Other therapies, including ivabradine, digoxin,
and H-ISDN, are not known to cause renal dysfunction.
RAAS-Inhibitors: Hyperkalemia
Patients with CKD are at increased risk for the development
of hyperkalemia, and this risk is further increased by the
introduction of RAAS inhibitors. Table 10 reviews the inci￾dence of hyperkalemia in different clinical trials. Hyper￾kalemia is most frequently observed with the initiation of
MRA therapy, but 6.4% of patients in the SOLVD Treat￾ment trial were reported to have developed hyperkalemia with
enalapril therapy. In the large MRA studies, the incidence of
hyperkalemia ranged from 2% to 11.8%, depending on the
definition (7,31,33). Importantly, no deaths attributable to
hyperkalemia were reported in any of the MRA studies.
Hyperkalemia occurred mostly in patients with low baseline
eGFR, in those with WRF during therapy, and most
importantly in those receiving spironolactone or eplerenone in
the RALES and EMPHASIS-HF trials, respectively
(32,76). A stringent monitoring of potassium levels in pa￾tients started on an MRA regimen seems warranted. For
instance, in the EMPHASIS-HF trial, eplerenone was star￾ted only if the serum potassium level was no more than 5.0
mmol/l. Thereafter, the dose of eplerenone was decreased if
the serum potassium level was 5.5 to 5.9 mmol/l during
follow-up and withheld if the serum potassium rose above 6.0
mmol/l. Reassessment of potassium was done 72 h after dose
reduction, and patients were re-challenged with eplerenone,
only if potassium levels were below 5.0 mmol/l. This regimen
was found to be highly effective, because the incidence of
hyperkalemia leading to study drug withdrawal was not
different from placebo (7). The new American College of
Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guide￾lines support these recommendations (2). These findings
highlight the importance of both hyperkalemia and rigorous

monitoring, especially during up-titration and in patients
with impaired renal function.
Renal Excretion of Pharmacological Therapies
Finally, the dose of several evidence-based treatments should
be adjusted according to GFR, because their clearance from
the circulation depends on renal function (Table 11). The
dose of ACEi should be halved in patients in stage 4 and 5
CKD or given every other day in patients on dialysis. The
same advice applies to MRAs, although eplerenone is not
indicated in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2
.
Although most beta-blockers are cleared from the circula￾tion to some extent by the kidneys, dose reduction is only
required in patients with a severely reduced eGFR to achieve
similar heart rate reductions compared with patients with
normal renal function.
Conclusions: Recommendations for
Clinical Practice
In general, the recommendations for medical therapy in
HF patients with concomitant renal dysfunction are not
qualitatively different from those in patients with preserved

renal function (Fig. 2) (1,2). Although there is less robust
evidence of benefit in HF patients with a reduced GFR,
subgroup analyses of the trials testing the major classes of
drugs (ACEi, beta-blockers, MRAs, and ARBs) and de￾vices (ICD/CRT) suggest that the relative risk reductions
are similar (and absolute risk reductions greater), although
these therapies might cause unwanted effects. Especially in
patients with stage 4 and 5 CKD, care should be taken to
assess whether possible beneficial effects might outweigh
the potential risks associated with the initiation of this
therapy. In all patients, frequent assessment of renal func￾tion and electrolytes (potassium) is essential to guide dose
adjustment and (dis)continuation of therapy. Treatment
discontinuation might be temporary and should follow the
algorithms successfully implemented in clinical trials (e.g.,
the CHARM/EMPHASIS-HF trials), and this close
monitoring is often best facilitated within disease manage￾ment programs. Importantly, attempts should be made to
reinstate the evidence-based therapy, once either renal
function has improved or stabilized. For any HF patient
with renal dysfunction (i.e., a patient with a greatly
increased risk of death or HF hospital stay in the immediate
future), the focus should be not only on survival but also on
quality of life and time spent out of hospital. Considering
that most evidence-based therapies are even more effective
in reducing hospital stay than they are at decreasing mor￾tality, each should at least be considered in patients with
stage 3 to 5 CKD but their use must also be individualized.
