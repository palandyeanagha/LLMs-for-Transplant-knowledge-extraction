Chronic hepatitis C in long term survivors of
haematological malignancy treated in a single
centre

Abstract
Aims-To investigate the impact of hep￾atitis C virus (HCV) infection in long term
survivors of haematological malignancy
treated before the introduction of blood
donor screening in September 1991.
Method-Patients were tested for evidence
of HCV infection by third generation en￾zyme linked immunosorbent assays, a re￾combinant immunoblot assay and reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Serum aspartate aminotransferase ac￾tivities were measured. The number and
type ofblood component units received by
each patient were recorded.
Results-Forty two patients were studied
who had received a total of 7143 blood
component units. Two patients (4.8%)
were found to have HCV infection, both
had histological evidence of chronic active
hepatitis, and one is now receiving treat￾ment with a-interferon. Both of these
patients had been missed by the ongoing
look-back programme which aims to de￾tect recipients of all known HCV infected
blood components.
Conclusion-Although HCV infection
affects a minority of long term survivors
of haematological malignancy, infected
patients may benefit from i-interferon
treatment. The screening of all patients
treated for haematological malignancy be￾fore September 1991 is advocated.

Patients who receive multiple transfusions of
blood components from a donor population
unscreened for hepatitis C antibodies (anti￾HCV) are at risk of developing post-transfusion
hepatitis following infection with hepatitis C
virus (HCV). Chronic hepatitis occurs in 50%
of those infected with hepatitis C' and 20% of
these develop cirrhosis within 10 years.' In the
UK screening of blood donors for hepatitis C
began in September 1991. Because of the large
number of exposures to blood components,
patients treated for acute leukaemia or un￾dergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT)
before this date are at high risk of developing
transfusion acquired hepatitis C infection.
Hepatitis C infection is particularly relevant to
this group of patients as some are now long
term survivors who are likely to be cured of
their original disease.
The aim of this study was to establish the
impact of hepatitis C infection on surviving
patients, who were either treated for acute
leukaemia or were BMT recipients before Sep￾tember 1991.
Methods
The study was conducted at Birmingham
Heartlands Hospital, one of two adult BMT
units serving the West Midlands. Each year
about 15 new cases of acute leukaemia are seen
and 25 BMTs (autologous and allogeneic) are
carried out. We reviewed the records of all such
patients who were treated prior to September
1991 and who are currently disease-free. The
number of exposures to donor blood com￾ponents was recorded. A donor exposure was
defined as a single transfused unit of red cells,
platelets, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate,
or a platelet aphaeresis pack. Patients were
recalled, and informed consent obtained before
blood was taken to assess hepatitis C status
and assay serum aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) activities.
Anti-HCV screening was performed using a
third generation enzyme linked immuno￾sorbent assay (EIA, Ortho Diagnostics, Neck￾argemund, Germany). Reactive samples were
further tested using a second EIA (Murex
Diagnostics, Dartford, UK) and a recombinant
immunoblot assay (RIBA-3, Ortho Diag￾nostics). All samples were also assessed by
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) for HCV RNA using the method of
Garson et al.' Anti-HCV positive patients were
referred to the regional liver unit for further
management.
Data on the prevalence of anti-HCV anti￾body among blood donors on commencement
of testing in 1991 was obtained from the West
Midlands Blood Transfusion Service.
Results
A total of 42 patients were assessed (table). A
further eight patients may have been eligible
(in remission when last seen), but have been
lost to follow up. The total number of donor
exposures in the 42 patients was 7143, with a
mean number of exposures of 170-1 units
(range 21-685). The mean time from end of
treatment was 6-4 years (range 2*9-14X1).
Twenty eight (67%) patients were more than
five years from the end of treatment, and there￾fore likely to have been cured of their original
disease.

shown in bold.
Patients 3 and 12 (4-8%) were anti-HCV
positive on screening and this was confirmed
by the second EIA and RIBA. Both patients
were also positive for hepatitis C RNA by RT￾PCR. No other patients were positive by RT￾PCR. The two HCV positive patients had re￾ceived extensive blood component support
(342 and 353 donor exposures) and were at
7-3 and 8-9 years from completing treatment.
At the time of recall, both patients had raised
AST activities of 88 and 67 U/I (normal <35
U/1). Histological assessment of liver biopsy
specimens showed modified Knodell scores of
5 and 9 (maximum score = 13). Patient 12 is
now receiving therapy with ot-interferon.
A further eight patients (table) had raised
AST activities at the time of recall with a mean
of 50 U/I (range 38-94 U/1). Patient 9 was a
known hepatitis B carrier; the rest were
screened for hepatitis B and found to be neg￾ative. Patient 28 has chronic hepatic graft ver￾sus host disease, and patient 7 had a liver biopsy
carried out which showed siderosis. The liver
function of all the above patients is being mon￾itored.
PREVALENCE OF ANTI-HCV IN BLOOD DONORS
In the West Midlands 56 blood donors among
a population of about 200 000 (that is, 0-028%)
were found to be anti-HCV positive (using a
first generation EIA followed by RIBA) at the
introduction of screening in September 1991
(personal communication). Donors who
showed indeterminate results have been ex￾cluded from our calculations as there is ac￾cumulating evidence that such individuals are
non-infectious.45 Using this data and the num￾ber of donor exposures we predicted that one
or two (1 8) patients within our group would
be HCV positive. It was assumed that 80% of
patients receiving a unit of blood from a RIBA
positive donor will become infected.4
Discussion
The prevalence of hepatitis C infection
amongst multitransfused patients with haem￾atological malignancy is low in this study. This
is in contrast to both a recent Italian study
where 29% (44/102) of children treated for
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were found to
be hepatitis C positive6 and a Finnish study
where 17% (12/71) of multitransfused adult
patients with leukaemia were positive.7 The
differences between countries seems to reflect
the differing prevalence of hepatitis C in the
local donor population. The quoted prevalence
in Italy being 1-3%8 and in Finland 0-106%.6
These are both significantly higher than the
prevalence of 0-028% found in the West Mid￾lands. However, it is likely that the prevalence
of hepatitis C carriage in blood donors was
higher before 1985 when measures were in￾troduced to prevent transmission of HIV via
transfusion.9 The frequency of anti-HCV anti￾231

body in our study (4 8%) correlates with that
found by Murphy et al (4-4%) in
a group of
183 patients with leukaemia.'0 This is despite
their use of
a first generation assay, without
confirmatory tests. Also, patients in that study
were not long term survivors; seven of the
eight hepatitis
C positive patients had died of
recurrent leukaemia.
Unlike previous studies61' we found no
patients who were RT-PCR positive and anti￾HCV negative. It is likely that immuno￾compromised patients with HCV will be anti￾HCV antibody negative if tested while still
immunosuppressed. However, they would be
RNA positive by RT-PCR. It would be ex￾pected that, with time, teir immune systems
would recover and anti-HCV be produced. As
all of the patients in this study are long term
survivors in remission we feel our results are
consistent with this theory. A look-back programme to identify patients
who received blood components from known
anti-HCV positive donors is underway in the
UK.'2 Clearly, this programme will not detect
patients who received blood from HCVpositive
donors who retired prior to the introduction
of screening. Significantly, both HCV infected
patients identified in this study were missed by
the look-back programme.
Cirrhosis is likely to develop in around one
fifth of patients with chronic hepatitis.2 Early
identification of such patients is important as
treatment with o-interferon can delay pro￾gression to cirrhosis; unfortunately, once cir￾rhosis is established interferon is of little
benefit.'3 It is not possible to rely on raised
serum aminotransferase activities alone to
select patients for hepatitis
C testing, as bot
chronic infection and significant liver disease
may be present in the absence of raised ac￾tivities.'4 Most patients previously treated for
acute leukaemia and BMT recipients are fol￾lowed up indefinitely and are therefore readily
accessible for testing. We therefore advocate
screening of all such long term survivors for
anti-HCV. These patients are at risk of de￾veloping life threatening complications of
chronic hepatitis
C infection many years after
being cured of their original disease and, in the
UK, the HCV look-back programme will not
necessarily detect them.
