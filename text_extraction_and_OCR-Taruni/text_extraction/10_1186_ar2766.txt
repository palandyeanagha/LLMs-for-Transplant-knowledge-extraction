Abstract
Introduction Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a frequent
manifestation of systemic sclerosis (SSc), and cytokines can
contribute to the disease pathology. The aim of the current study
was to identify specific changes in cytokine levels that may serve
as disease markers and possible targets for therapy.
Methods Cytokines were measured with bioplex analysis in 38
bronchoalveolar fluids (BALFs) from 32 SSc patients (27 with
alveolitis and 11 without alveolitis) and 26 control patients. In
the case of SSc patients, cytokines were correlated with the
respective bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell differentiation,
lung function, and thoracic HR-CT score. For 35 BALF samples
derived from 29 SSc patients, follow-up investigations of clinical
data, lung-function parameter, or thoracic HR-CT scans were
available to evaluate the predictive capacity of BALF cytokines
and chemokines.
Results High IL-7 levels were characteristic of SSc-associated
interstitial lung disease (ILD) and, in addition, when compared
with ILD-negative SSc patients, ILD-positive SSc patients
revealed higher IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2 (MCP-1) BALF levels.
High CCL2 and IL-8 BALF concentrations were associated with
neutrophilic and mixed alveolitis. Cytokine levels of IL-4, IL-8,
and CCL2 correlated negatively with lung-function parameters;
CCL2 concentrations also correlated with HR-CT scores. High
concentrations of several cytokines were associated with the
progress of ILD and end-stage ILD. Univariate analyses revealed
high IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels as the
best predictors for progressive disease, together with lung￾function parameters, young age, and neutrophilic alveolitis.
Multivariate analyses partially confirmed these results but did not
sufficiently converge because of the limited number of patients.
Conclusions The association of BALF cytokines with lung
fibrosis and its progress suggests that cytokines contribute to
the pathogenesis of ILD and hence could be regarded as
potential therapeutic targets.

Introduction
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease character￾ized by fibrosis of the skin and various internal organs. Intersti￾tial lung disease (ILD) and its complications represent the
most prominent causes of death in SSc. Alveolitis develops in
up to 80% of SSc patients, and progression to end-stage
fibrosis occurs in about 15% [1]. Unfortunately, factors that
predict progression and poor prognosis are missing. Cellular
differentiation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells is often
used to define alveolitis. In addition, neutrophilic alveolitis has
been suggested to predict the progression of fibrosing alveo￾litis [2]. In a recent multicentric study including 141 patients,
BAL neutrophilia was associated with early and overall mortal￾ity, but the effect on overall mortality was lost when disease
severity was taken into account [3]. The authors concluded
that BAL findings add only limited prognostic information in
SSc-related interstitial lung disease in addition to HR-CT
scans and lung-function parameters (LFP) [3,4]. Nevertheless,
the authors argued that other markers might reflect disease
progress and the pathogenic mechanisms present in SSc-ILD.
The role of chemokines and cytokines as markers reflecting
disease severity and predicting outcome in SSc-related lung
disease has not been studied extensively. Chemokines are
important regulators of cell migration and the recruitment of
leukocytes to specific tissue sites [5]. Among them, monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2) and macrophage
inflammatory protein-1β (MIP1β or CCL4) may play a role in
SSc, as the overexpression of these chemokines has been
detected in SSc-related lung disease [6,7]. In addition to
chemokines, cytokines such as IL-6 or TGF-β also can mediate
different pathogenic processes in systemic sclerosis. Poly￾morphisms of several cytokines found to be associated with
SSc and involved in the regulation of fibrosis support their role
in SSc pathogenesis [8,9]. Therefore, both chemokines and
cytokines could play a role in the pathogenesis of SSc-ILD and
as targets of future therapies [10].
In the present investigation, we have determined levels of
cytokines and chemokines in BAL fluids (BALF) in an early
SSc cohort. Furthermore, we analyzed controls with ILD due
to other diseases to identify key cytokines specifically involved
in the pathogenesis of SSc-related lung disease. Furthermore,
in a cross-sectional study, the correlation of cytokine and
chemokine levels with signs of lung fibrosis was studied.
Finally, by follow-up investigations of the clinical data, lung
function, and HR-CT scores, the predictive value of cytokines
and chemokines was evaluated. We have identified key
cytokines that appear to be associated with lung fibrosis and
that may predict worsening of ILD in SSc patients.
Materials and methods
Patients
The 38 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were
obtained from 32 SSc patients and 26 patients with other dis￾eases between 2004 and 2006. SSc patients (20 with diffuse
and 12 with limited SSc) fulfilled the preliminary criteria for the
disease classification of SSc [11]. Epidemiologic data of
patients at the time of BAL are presented in Table 1. Mean
prednisone doses in SSc patients and in control patients were
5 mg/d and 5.6 mg/d, respectively. In the control group, 20
patients had alveolitis, and among them, 12 had sarcoidosis,
and six patients had idiopathic interstitial lung disease. One
patient had broncheolitis obliterans and another, alveolar pro￾teinosis. Six patients with normal BAL cell differentiation and
no lung pathology were defined as healthy persons. BAL was
carried out when indicated (to diagnose or exclude ILD, infec￾tions, or malignant diseases), with the written informed con￾sent of patients for diagnostic or clinical purposes. Patients
with present pulmonary infections were excluded from the
study. The study was approved by the local ethics committee

(EA1/013/705). Written consent was obtained from each
patient.
Assessment of the patients
For cross-sectional analyses, patients were assessed for signs
of lung fibrosis with lung-function tests (LFTs) or with high-res￾olution computed tomography (HR-CT) scans, including HR￾CT scores (Aquilion 16/Aquilion 64, Toshiba Medical Sys￾tems, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands). Furthermore, for the eval￾uation of fibrotic skin changes, the modified Rodnan Skin
Score (mRSS) was used [12]. Pulmonary fibrosis was defined
by evidence of fibrosis such as bibasilar fibrosis on chest radi￾ograms or HR-CT scans or both. Spirometry and body plethys￾mography (Siregnost FD 40/FD 91, Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany) were performed to determine forced vital capacity
(FVC) and total lung capacity (TLC). The pulmonary diffusing
capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was determined with
the single-breath method (DLCO-SB; Transferscreen II, Fa.
Jäger, Würzburg, Germany). Values for TLC, FVC, and DLCO
were expressed as percentages of predictive normal values
adjusted for age, sex, and height. For the longitudinal study,
follow-up of LFTs and HR-CT scores was performed at a mean
period of 49 weeks and 58 weeks, respectively. Clinical data
also were obtained for SSc patients. Deterioration of lung￾function parameters (predicted FVC and DLCO-SB) was
defined by changes of 10% or more. Progressive lung disease
was defined by worsening of at least one lung function param￾eter by 10% or more or by an increase in HR-CT scores of 3
or more, or both. If the HR-CT scan was not available for scor￾ing, progressive disease was defined by the consent of two
experienced radiologists. In addition, end-stage ILD was
defined either by death or by the need for continuous oxygen
supplementation.
CT scan and visual analysis
CT scans were performed by using a CT scanner (Aquilion 16/
Aquilion 64) 3 or fewer months before BAL. Acquisition was
done by using the 0.75-mm detectors; images were recon￾structed in 0.5-mm slice widths. Thin-section CT scans of the
lungs were independently evaluated by two radiologists inde￾pendently on a GE Workstation at fixed window width of
1,500 Hounsfield units (HU) and level (-500 HU). Visual eval￾uation included a score of severity and a score of extent
(range, 0 to 30) and was performed as described [13]. To
assess intraoperator reproducibility, one radiologist (S.M.)
repeated the visual assessment in all patients 3 times, sepa￾rated by at least 24 hours.
BAL procedure and recovery of BALF
BAL was performed as recommended by the American Tho￾racic Society according to the task-force guidelines and as
described previously by using an Olympus BF 1T20 fiberoptic
bronchoscope (Olympus Europe, Hamburg, Germany)
[14,15]. In brief, the bronchoscope was wedged into a seg￾ment bronchus of the right middle lobe, and 150 ml of 0.9%
sodium chloride solution (37°C) was instilled and gently aspi￾rated. BAL differential cell counts were performed on cytospin
preparations stained with the May-Grünwald-Giemsa method.
According to normal values obtained by the same BAL proce￾dure [16], the following BAL differential cell counts were clas￾sified as pathologic in nonsmokers: more than 15%
lymphocytes, more than 3% neutrophils, more than 0.5% eosi￾nophils, or a combination of these; in smokers, more than 7%
lymphocytes, more than 3% neutrophils, more than 0.5% eosi￾nophils, or a combination of these. Alveolitis/ILD was defined
as an increase in the proportions or absolute numbers (or
both) of inflammatory cells present in BAL fluid [17]. Patho￾logic BAL cell counts were differentiated into lymphocytic,
neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and mixed forms (combination of
lymphocytosis and granulocytosis).
Bioplex analysis
Cytokine concentrations adjusted according to the recovery
rate of BALFs were determined by using the Bio-Plex Protein
Array System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Cytokine-spe￾cific antibody-coated beads (Bio-Rad) were used for these
experiments. The assay was performed according to the man￾ufacturer's instructions. Cytokine concentrations were auto￾matically calculated with Bio-Plex Manager software by using
a standard curve derived from a recombinant cytokine stand￾ard. According to previous experiments analyzing 17 cytokines
(IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17,
CCL2, CCL4, TNF-α, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and INF-γ) derived
from BALF samples of 11 SSc patients as well as from 15
controls, the following cytokines were selected for further anal￾yses of all BALF samples: IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, CCL2,
CCL4, G-CSF, and TNF-α.
Detection of TGF-β1 in BALF and sera
For the detection of TGF-β1 concentrations, a commercially
available ELISA was used and performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Quantikine Human TGF-β1, R&D
Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). The recommended dilution
of sera (1:40) and of BALF (1:20) revealed values below the
detection level. Therefore, sera and BALF were diluted 1:20
and 1:5, respectively. Values were corrected according to the
dilution and BALF recovery.
Statistics
GraphPad Prism Version 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA, USA) for Microsoft®, Windows, was used for sta￾tistical analysis. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was
performed to compare cytokine levels in different groups. P
values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically signifi￾cant. Linear correlation was estimated by the Pearson correla￾tion coefficient. Logistic regression analysis was performed by
using the SPSS V 15.0 statistical package. BALF cytokine
concentrations were examined with univariate analysis, as well
as age, gender, DLCO-SB, FVC, HR-CT score, mRSS, neu￾trophilic and eosinophilic alveolitis, and BALF cytokines. Multi-

variate analysis was performed with those parameters
selected by univariate analyses with P values less than 0.1.
In a second multivariate analysis, only BALF cytokines were
studied. Multiple samples from one patient were accordingly
weighed for analysis. Based on the pilot character of the study
in patients with a rare disease, P values were not adjusted for
multiple testing.
Results
Patients with systemic sclerosis have specific cytokine 
changes
As shown in Table 2, SSc-associated alveolitis is character￾ized by specific BALF cytokine changes. In SSc patients with
ILD, IL-7 concentrations were higher compared with those
found in patients with ILD due to other diseases. When ILD in
SSc patients was compared with the ILD due to sarcoidosis,
higher IL-8 levels in addition to higher IL-7 levels were
detected. BALF analyses of idiopathic ILD patients were char￾acterized by lower IL-7 and IL-10 concentrations compared
with those of SSc-ILD patients (Table 2).
When comparing ILD-positive SSc patients with ILD-negative
SSc patients, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and CCL2 levels were sig￾nificantly increased in the ILD-positive SSc patients. Com￾pared with ILD-negative healthy controls, ILD-positive SSc
patients showed higher IL-7, IL-8, and CCL2 levels (Table 1).
In addition, ILD-positive SSc patients revealed higher TNF-α
and CCL4 levels. BALF TGF-β1 and IL-13 levels were below
the detection level in SSc patients (data not shown). ILD-pos￾itive patients with other diseases revealed a different cytokine/
chemokine pattern. In patients with idiopathic ILD, only
increased CCL4 (median, 126.9 pg/ml) and CCL2 (132.2 pg/
ml) concentrations were found compared with those in ILD￾negative healthy controls (P = 0.0043 and P = 0.026; data not
shown). ILD due to sarcoidosis was characterized by
increased cytokine levels of TNF-α compared with healthy

donors (1.2 versus 0 pg/ml). The other BALF cytokine levels
did not show any significant differences.
Cytokine levels of IL-8, CCL2, and IL-6 are highest in 
patients with neutrophilic alveolitis and are not 
secondary phenomena due to the BAL cellular 
constituents
Concentrations of only few cytokines were associated with the
dominant BAL cellular constituent determining the type of
alveolitis. IL-8 levels from SSc patients were high in patients
with neutrophilic and mixed alveolitis (median, 250.3 and
105.5 pg/ml, respectively) compared with SSc patients with
normal BAL cell values (47.0 pg/ml, Figure 1a). Patients with
lymphocytic alveolitis did not show increased IL-8 levels. Sim￾ilar results were found for the CCL2 levels (Figure 1b). Only
patents with neutrophilic alveolitis revealed higher IL-6 con￾centrations compared with SSc controls (27.3 pg/ml versus
1.9 pg/ml; P = 0.002; data not shown). Mixed lymphocytic/
neutrophilic alveolitis was characterized by increased IL-2 lev￾els compared with ILD-negative SSc patients (P = 0.02, data
not shown). To evaluate whether BALF cytokine concentra￾tions are secondary phenomena due to the different cellular
constituents, we correlated both the percentage and the abso￾lute number of the different cell types with BALF cytokine con￾centrations in SSc patients and controls (Table 3). In SSc
patients, other cytokine and chemokine concentrations corre￾lated with the absolute number or percentages of cells com￾pared with controls. Thus, IL-6 and CCL2 levels correlated
with the percentage of eosinophils in controls, but not in
patients with SSc. In general, more correlations between the
percentages or absolute numbers of the cellular compounds
were found in controls compared with the SSc patients (Table
3).
Cytokine and chemokine levels correlated with LFTs and 
HR-CT scores for lung fibrosis in SSc
As shown in Table 2, several cytokines were increased in SSc￾ILD patients when compared with ILD-negative SSc patients.
The highest upregulated cytokine was CCL2; that was three￾to fourfold increased when compared with healthy donors or
ILD-negative SSc patients. Other cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6,
IL-7, and IL-8 were two- to threefold upregulated in ILD-posi￾tive SSc patients compared with ILD-negative SSc patients.
In SSc patients, negative correlations were found between the
predicted DLCO levels and the BALF concentrations of IL-2,
IL-4, IL-8, and CCL2 (Table 4). Predicted FVC values also cor￾related negatively with the BALF IL-4 cytokine levels, IL-8, and
CCL2 levels. We also found weak but significant correlations
between the predicted TLC values and the BALF IL-4, IL-8,
and CCL2 concentrations. No correlations were noted
between IL-6/IL-7 concentrations and lung-function parame￾ters.
We had 36 HR-CT scores derived from 30 SSc patients at the
time of BAL. When comparing the HR-CT scores with the
cytokine levels, a weak correlation was seen between CCL2
levels and the HR-CT scores (Table 4). Patients with an HR￾CT score of 20 or greater had higher CCL2 levels when com￾pared with patients with fewer fibrotic changes (P = 0.04, data
not shown). No other cytokine concentrations were found to
be related to HR-CT scores.

BALF cytokine levels predict deterioration of lung 
fibrosis
For 29 SSc patients providing 35 BAL samples (all multiple
samples were from patients with end-stage ILD), follow-up
investigations of ILD were available (29 HR-CT scans at a
mean period of 58 weeks after BAL and 27 comparable lung
function follow-up investigations at a mean period of 49 weeks
after BAL). Furthermore, patients were evaluated for end￾stage ILD for a mean period of 38 months after BAL. Of the 10
patients with progressive disease, 6 patients developed end￾stage ILD. As shown in Table 5, high BALF cytokine concen￾trations of several cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF￾α, were associated with progressive or end-stage ILD. IL-7 lev￾els showed a trend to be predictive for progressive and end￾stage diseases compared with constant controls (P = 0.07
and P = 0.09, respectively). Additionally, neutrophilic alveolitis,
reduced DLCO and FVC values, as well as young age were
found to be more frequent in patients with progressive dis￾ease. In contrast, higher HR-CT scores and mRSS levels at
the time of BAL were not associated with progressive lung dis￾ease (Table 5). By univariate analysis, predictors for progres￾sive ILD were young age, low predicted DCLO levels, high IL￾2 and TNF-α levels (P < 0.05), and a high percentage of neu￾trophils (Figure 2a). The latter was the best predictor for pro￾gressive ILD (p = 0.023). Predictors for end-stage ILD were
again low predicted DLCO and FVC levels, high IL-2 levels,
and a high percentage of neutrophils (Figure 2b, P < 0.05). All
potential predictors identified by univariate analysis (P < 0.1)
were subsequently tested with multivariate analysis. The step￾wise forward- and backward-selection methods revealed dif￾ferent combined indexes, presumably caused by the many
parameters tested in a relative small group of patients. For pro￾gressive disease, young age and neutrophilic alveolitis were
selected in both modes, either combined with FVC or with IL￾2, TNF-α, and IL-7. For the small group of end-stage ILD
patients, neutrophilic alveolitis together with IL-1 and FVC
revealed a predictive value. When only BALF cytokines were
studied, high levels of IL-2 and TNF-α predicted progressive/
end-stage ILD.
Discussion
In the present work, we studied cytokine and chemokine levels
in BALF to identify key players in the disease process and
potential therapeutic targets of SSc-related lung disease. Sys￾temic sclerosis is a rare disease, and most studies analyzing
BALF cytokines have included only few patients with SSc. Our
analysis is one of the largest studies addressing soluble medi￾ators in BALF associated with SScs. Furthermore, in contrast
to other investigations that have used ultrafiltration or other
methods to concentrate BALF cytokines and chemokines for
ELISA testing [18-21], we used a highly sensitive Bioplex
assay, allowing the detection of cytokines without any BALF
manipulation that could influence the stability of cytokines. By
using this technique, we observed abnormalities in a broad
range of cytokines and chemokines, probably reflecting the

complexity of the underlying disease processes present in
SSc. Cytokines/chemokines produced by lymphocytes (for
example, IL-4, IL-2) and monocytes/macrophages (CCL2,
CCL4, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6), as well as other cell types, were
shown to be increased, indicating activation of different cell
types in SSc. In controls with ILD due to other diseases, fewer
abnormalities were observed; however; some cytokines/
chemokines, such as CCL2 and CCL3, were increased in idi￾opathic ILD as well as in SSc-associated ILD, indicating an
important, but nonspecific contribution of these chemokines in
lung fibrosis. As tested here for SSc patients, CCL2 concen￾trations were found to be correlated with lung-function param￾eters and HR-CT score. The importance of CCL2 as a key
mediator for lung fibrosis also is supported by data from animal
models showing a reduction and prevention of bleomycin￾induced lung fibrosis by anti-CCL2 monoclonal antibodies or
by pharmacologic blockade, respectively [22,23]. CCL2 also
mediates profibrotic effects in SSc through the release of IL-4
from T cells, and IL-4 also was found to correlate with lung￾function parameters in our study [24]. Taken together, our data
support the role of CCL2/3 as targets for future therapies.
Additional cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-8, also could
be important, as IL-8 gene polymorphisms are associated with
an increased risk of SSc [25]. IL-8 also is expressed by scle￾roderma fibroblasts and by alveolar macrophages [26-28],

and increased IL-8 levels in BALF and serum of SSc patients
have been described by others [18,29]. By reducing multivar￾iate logistic regression analysis on BALF cytokines, high IL-8
levels also were predictive of a poor prognosis. IL-8 is a potent
chemoattractant for neutrophils, and the correlation of IL-8 lev￾els with LFTs suggests a possible role of this cytokine in ILD
pathogenesis, as suggested by others [29]. Therefore, IL-8
could also serve as a potential therapeutic target.
In comparison with alveolitis due to other diseases, SSc￾related alveolitis was characterized by higher levels of IL-7,
suggesting disease-specific pathogenic processes. IL-7 was
originally described as a potent proliferative stimulus of pro-B
and pre-B cells from bone marrow [30] and as a promoter of
the growth and expansion of mature effector T cells [31]. It is
expressed by stromal medullar cells, epithelial cells, and mac￾rophages [32] and exhibits both fibrotic and antifibrotic
effects, probably underlined here by the missing correlations
between IL-7 levels and LFTs or HR-CT scores detectable for

other cytokines. IL-7 transgenic mice showed increased levels
of the profibrotic cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 [33]. Here, higher IL￾4 levels also were detected in SSc-associated alveolitis. The
antifibrotic effect of IL-7 is reflected by an improvement of ble￾omycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis through IL-7 [34]. This
effect could explain the better prognosis of SSc-associated
alveolitis compared with that of idiopathic ILD [35].
However, as suggested by our study, the activation of T cells
by IL-7 could be important for SSc-ILD. In line with this, and in
addition to the clinical associations of IL-4, IL-2 concentrations
correlate with predicted DLCO levels. Furthermore, high IL-2
levels together with high TNF-α levels were the best predictors
for progressive/end-stage ILD. Increased levels of the IL-2
receptor are proposed as a marker of disease activity in SSc
[36] and SSc-associated ILD [37]. In line with this, blockade
of the IL-2 receptor activation ameliorated bleomycin lung
fibrosis [38].
In another study, anti-CD3 therapy also diminished bleomycin￾induced fibrosis [39]. Therefore, T-cell therapy could provide
a useful target for further therapies.
Because most of the fibroblast characteristics obtained from
SSc patients are reproduced in normal fibroblasts after stimu￾lation with TGF-β1, TGF-β1 was stated as a key cytokine in
SSc-associated fibrosis (reviewed in [40]). Here, BALF TGF￾β1 levels were below the detection level. In contrast, serum
TGF-β1 levels were detectable by using the same assay but
did not provide any correlations with LFTs or HR-CT scores
and revealed no predictive capacity (Figure 2). The low levels
of potential profibrotic cytokines found in our study do not
exclude autocrine or paracrine effects, as suggested by others
to play a role in SSc [41]. However; several cytokines analyzed
here and showing increased concentrations exhibit inhibitory
effects on TGF-β1 expression (for example, IL-7 and TNF-α),
indicating a contribution of TGF-β1-independent mechanisms
in SSc-ILD proposed by others, such as autoantibodies, Th2
cytokines, growth factors, and several other cytokines/chem￾okines [42,43]. As detected with our first analysis including 17
different cytokines, profibrotic cytokines such as IL-13 or IL-17
also revealed very low or undetectable BALF concentrations
and no differences from controls or a relation to ILD. Levels of
IL-17 correlated with BAL lymphocytosis but not with clinical
parameters in SSc (data not shown). Because BAL lymphocy￾tosis is associated with stable lung function over time [44], IL￾17 does not seem to play a major role in SSc-ILD. Despite the
possible important role of lymphocyte activation and cytokine
release in SSc-ILD, accumulation of lymphocytes in BAL was
not predictive of disease progression.
Instead, and supporting studies from several groups, we found
neutrophilic alveolitis as one of the strongest predictors for
progressive disease. The role of neutrophilic alveolitis and
BAL analysis as predictors of progressive disease was
recently discussed [45]. Several observational studies, includ￾ing a total of 190 SSc patients, indicated that the presence of
BAL alveolitis, and especially of neutrophilic alveolitis, was
associated with deterioration of lung-function tests in patients
that did not receive immunosuppressive treatments (summa￾rized in [45]).
In contrast, a recent analysis of 66 placebo-treated patients
from the Scleroderma Lung Study did not show any relation
between the presence of baseline BAL granulocytosis and
changes in lung function [4]. As recently outlined, a previous
study was not sufficiently powered to allow subgroup stratifi￾cation [45]. Furthermore, undetected infections, technical
issues such as the instilled volume of saline, the site from
which BAL was performed, different cut-offs used to define
alveolitis, or comorbidity such as reflux can influence BAL cel￾lularity (summarized in [45]). This could lead to different
results, as reported in other studies [3,4]. Here, in this single￾center study, we used a standardized procedure, and we have
adjusted the cytokine concentrations for BAL recovery. By this
procedure, TNF-α, a cytokine with the capacity to increase the
migration of neutrophils, was found to be one of the best pre￾dictors for poor prognosis. This cytokine was found to corre￾late with the absolute number and frequency of BAL
neutrophils (Table 3). In line with this, our study supports the
predictive value of neutrophilic alveolitis, which could be differ￾ent from granulocytic alveolitis, because eosinophils did not
reveal any predictive capacity in SSc. However, our study is
not powered to provide conclusive information about the value
of BAL to predict disease progress. Nevertheless, cytokines
found to be predictive, even in our small patient sample, have
promise of a high prognostic potential. Their role in a multivar￾iate setting in addition, to known prognostic factors, must be
assured with higher case numbers. Further studies are needed
to address this question.
Major limitations of the study are the fact that the majority of
patients received immunosuppressive therapies at the time of
BAL. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that immunosuppres￾sants could influence BALF cytokines and, subsequently, cyto￾logic and clinical correlations. However, in the few patients
investigated twice or thrice, no significant BAL changes were
observed despite immunosuppressive therapies. Another limi￾tation of the study is the low number of patients and the heter￾ogeneity of the control group.
In conclusion, we identified several abnormalities in the
cytokine and chemokine patterns in BALF of SSc patients,
suggesting an important role of these mediators in the patho￾genesis of ILD. According to our results, CCL2, IL-7, and
probably IL-8 and IL-4 appear to be the most-promising candi￾dates for a targeted therapy in SSc-associated ILD. Further￾more, T-cell targeted therapy could be a promising therapeutic
intervention. The data also suggest the usefulness of BALF

analyses as an early predictor of progression of SSc-related
ILD.
Conclusions
High BALF cytokine and chemokine levels are associated with
severe ILD in SSc and are associated with deterioration of ILD.
Cytokines and chemokines could have a role in the disease
pathogenesis of ILD. Analyses of BALF chemokine and
cytokine levels can probably provide therapeutic targets in
SSc-associated ILD.
