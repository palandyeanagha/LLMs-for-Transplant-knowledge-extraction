Abstract
Background: During the last decade there has been a need to respond and recover from various types of
emergencies including mass casualty events (MCEs), mass toxicological/chemical events (MTEs), and biological
events (pandemics and bio-terror agents). Effective emergency preparedness is more likely to be achieved if an
all-hazards response plan is adopted.
Objectives: To investigate if there is a relationship among hospitals' preparedness for various emergency scenarios,
and whether components of one emergency scenario correlate with preparedness for other emergency scenarios.
Methods: Emergency preparedness levels of all acute-care hospitals for MCEs, MTEs, and biological events were
evaluated, utilizing a structured evaluation tool based on measurable parameters. Evaluations were made by
professional experts in two phases: evaluation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) followed by a site visit.
Relationships among total preparedness and different components' scores for various types of emergencies were
analyzed.
Results: Significant relationships were found among preparedness for different emergencies. Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) for biological events correlated with preparedness for all investigated emergency scenarios.
Strong correlations were found between training and drills with preparedness for all investigated emergency
scenarios.
Conclusions: Fundamental critical building blocks such as SOPs, training, and drill programs improve preparedness
for different emergencies including MCEs, MTEs, and biological events, more than other building blocks, such as
equipment or knowledge of personnel. SOPs are especially important in unfamiliar emergency scenarios. The
findings support the adoption of an all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness.

Background
During the last decade the need to respond to various
emergencies such as natural disasters and technological
and complex mass casualty events (MCEs) has increased
[1]. While the nature of the events may differ significantly,
preparedness for them appears to have much in common
in terms of the knowledge and skills required [2, 3]. Nu￾merous mitigation programs have proven to be highly
cost-effective in preparing for different types of crises [4].
Effective preparedness of hospitals for different hazards
is more likely to be achieved if healthcare professionals
adopt an all-hazards response plan that applies generic
basic principles for managing different scenarios [5–8].
The all-hazards approach contends that emergency pre￾paredness requires attention not just to specific types of
hazards but also to actions that increase preparedness for
all risks [7, 8].
In view of these common components, the World
Health Association (WHO) as well as other leaders in
crisis management advocate the all-hazards approach as
the recommended mechanism for emergency prepared￾ness [9]. Nevertheless, the all-hazards policy has as yet
not been fully adopted. Some experts support other
programs such as utilization of risk assessment and

reduction as a starting point for provision of goods and
services based on needs assessment [10]. It has often
been presented that capacity building programs focus
on preparedness for a specific disaster; therefore, the le￾gislation, administrative arrangements, and institutional
structures are frequently created to respond to that sce￾nario rather than to the common components that
characterize different types of emergencies [11]. It has
even been stated that despite lessons learned from dis￾asters, increase in knowledge, and technological devel￾opment, no shift in policy has been made with regard
to crisis management [12].
Limited information is available with regard to what
constitutes effective emergency preparedness; however,
there is consensus that availability of a comprehensive
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), exercises and
drills are important components in the preparedness
process [13–15]. Implementation of realistic and well￾run drills is a complex task requiring significant
resources in terms of cost, manpower, and time commit￾ment; thus the number and extent of drills are limited
[16–18]. It would seem that there is much to be gained
from identifying principles and knowledge that are com￾mon to all preparedness programs; ignoring these simi￾larities and differences may hinder effective inter-agency
collaboration [19].
The importance of preparing the medical system to deal
with different emergencies while attempting to contain
costs, suggests that it would be advisable to determine if
common components can be identified. To date the rela￾tionship among preparedness for different types of emer￾gency events has not been well investigated [8, 20].
Implementing an all-hazards approach in Israel
The Israeli healthcare system adopted and maintains an
all-hazards approach to emergency management, basing
its policy on preparedness for mass casualty events [2].
All hospitals are instructed to utilize similar principles
in preparing for MCEs, mass toxicological events
(MTEs), and biological events, and modify only compo￾nents that are hazard-specific such as utilizing isolation
facilities in biological events or decontamination of cas￾ualties in a toxicological event. The main components
that are implemented as the result of this policy include
designation of similar admitting sites in different sce￾narios; assigning staff members (as much as possible)
to the same site regardless of the type of emergency;
applying similar principles for storing and allocating
life-saving and supplementary equipment; preparing the
infrastructure to be utilized in different crises; and inte￾grating generic modules in the training programs for
the different hazards.
As Israel has had to deal with numerous types of
emergencies in the past ten years, including MCEs,
man-made conflicts, and pandemics, its experience may
shed light on the effectiveness of the all-hazards ap￾proach and contribute to other decision makers in set￾ting the policy regarding emergency management.
The aim of this study was to investigate implementa￾tion of the all-hazards approach in order to identify: 1)
if preparedness of hospitals to a specific emergency
scenario relates to preparedness for other types of
emergencies; and 2) relationships between specific
components to the overall preparedness for various
emergencies.
Methods
Utilization of an evaluation tool to measure level of
emergency preparedness
An evaluation tool consisting of 490 measurable and ob￾jective parameters was developed through a comprehen￾sive literature review and recommendations of content
experts. Of the 490 parameters, 239 were common for all
emergency scenarios; the additional 251 were scenario￾specific to mass casualty events, mass toxicological
events, or biological events (67, 78, and 106 parameters,
respectively). The content validity of the evaluation tool
and the rate of importance of each parameter were deter￾mined through a modified Delphi process that included
229 content experts. Only parameters that were agreed
upon by over 60% of the experts were included in the
evaluation tool. The tool was tested in a pilot study con￾ducted in two hospitals and, following its modification,
evaluations were carried out by surveyors from the Min￾istry of Health and the Home Front Command. The
evaluation process involved a review of the Standard Op￾erating Procedures followed by a site visit during which
all other components of the emergency preparedness
were observed and measured. The overall score of readi￾ness for emergencies was calculated utilizing a computer
program that was specifically developed for this purpose,
taking into account the level of importance of each par￾ameter. The evaluation tool and its development were
previously described [21] and were utilized to evaluate
the level of emergency preparedness of all acute-care
hospitals in Israel.
The 490 parameters, encompassing the various com￾ponents of emergency preparedness, were classified into
the following four categories:
1) Standard operating procedures (SOP) – based on
national guidelines that were developed by the
Ministry of Health (MOH), each hospital is required
to develop its own SOP for the various hazards;
2) Training and drills – according to the policy set by
the MOH, each hospital is required to conduct
specific training programs and participate in both
table-top exercises and full scale annual drills;
Adini et al. Israel Journal of Health Policy Research 2012, 1:40 Page 2 of 7
http://www.ijhpr.org/content/1/1/40

3) Knowledge of staff – the level of required knowledge
of staff regarding the different components of
emergency response to the various hazards is
determined by the MOH;
4) Infrastructure and equipment – designated
equipment essential for managing different hazards,
such as ventilation machines, personal protective
gear, vaccinations, and anti-viral drugs, must be
procured to assure an effective emergency response.
Similarly, vital infrastructure, such as
decontamination sites or helipads, must be installed.
An example of parameters in each of the categories is
presented in Table 1.
In addition to the evaluation tool, a random sample of
approximately 30 physicians and nurses in each of the hos￾pitals was given 56 standardized oral questions to evaluate
their knowledge of the emergency preparedness process.
Rating impact of each parameter on level of emergency
preparedness
The parameters were rated by the experts according to
three levels of importance. Level A indicated parameters
with a high impact on emergency preparedness (repre￾senting 60% of the total preparedness score). Level B
indicated parameters with a medium impact (represent￾ing 30% of the total score). Level C indicated para￾meters with the lowest impact (representing 10% of the
total score). Mean rating scores for each parameter were
calculated. The parameters were then classified accord￾ing to four categories of emergency preparedness: SOPs,
training and drills, infrastructure and equipment, and
knowledge of staff.
Evaluating levels of emergency preparedness in hospitals
The level of emergency preparedness was evaluated in
24 general hospitals in Israel, utilizing the evaluation
tool by a team of 16 professional experts in emergency
management from the MOH and the Home Front Com￾mand (HFC). Each component was evaluated by at least
two raters, independently, and at the end of the evalu￾ation process, the inter-rater reliability was calculated by
comparing the findings of the two raters.
The evaluation process involved two phases: 1) an
evaluation of the SOPs of the hospitals for MCE,
MTE, and biological events prior to a site visit; and 2)
a site visit by an evaluation team, at which time the
remaining components for emergency preparedness were
evaluated.
Comparing levels of emergency preparedness to the
various scenarios
The results of the hospital evaluations for the different
scenarios were analyzed using an in-house computer pro￾gram that was developed specifically to calculate a score
for the level of preparedness. This score was calculated by
Table 1 Examples of parameters in each of the four categories
Number Category Type of emergency Parameter
1 Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs)
Mass casualty event The SOP for mass casualty events is updated for the last year
Mass toxicological event The hospital identified a decontamination team that will be
deployed to the immediate site
Biological event The biological SOP includes a section regarding treatment
of medical bio-hazard waste
2 Training & drills Mass casualty event 80% of the surgical staff reinforcing the Emergency
Department are graduates of an ATLS (advanced trauma
life support) course
Mass toxicological event 70% of the emergency department staff participated in a
designated mass toxicological event training program
Biological event The hospital defined the medical staff that are required to
participate in the biological training program
3 Knowledge of staff Mass casualty event The "nurse in charge" is proficient in using the public
address system
Mass toxicological event More than 85% of the emergency department's nursing
staff passed a toxicological test with scores >90
Biological event The emergency department physicians are proficient in
the mechanism of sending samples to the microbiology
laboratory
4 Infrastructure &
equipment
Mass casualty event The "immediate site" for treating severe casualties is
equipped with a cart designated for treating children
Mass toxicological event At least 15 personal protection masks are immediately
available in the emergency department
Biological event Designated sites for isolating patients suffering from
infectious diseases have been defined

multiplying the level of performance identified for each
parameter (satisfactory performance allotted the maximal
points; needing minor revisions allotted 70%; needing
major revisions allotted 30%; while unsatisfactory per￾formance allotted 0 points) by the relative value of the
parameter (each Level A parameter was worth 0.57% of
the overall score; each Level B parameter was worth
0.17%; and each Level C was worth 0.05% of the overall
score). The points achieved for each parameter were
summed in order to calculate the overall score of the hos￾pital. The score for the level of emergency preparedness
for each scenario was also analyzed in relation to each
category: SOPs, training and drills, infrastructure and
equipment, and knowledge of personnel.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS 15 (SPSS Inc., 2006). The
preparedness scores of the hospitals were analyzed using
the Spearman rho correlation coefficient, as follows: 1)
Correlation of preparedness score for the different emer￾gency scenarios (MCE, MTE, and biological events); 2)
Correlation of scores in each category to the total pre￾paredness score for the different emergency scenarios.
Correlation coefficients were defined as follows: rho =
0.25–0.44 – weak correlation; rho = 0.45–0.60 – moder￾ate correlation; rho 0.61–0.80 – strong correlation, and
0.81–1.00 very strong correlation. Each level of correl￾ation is regarded as statistically meaningful if p < 0.05.
Results
Relationship between overall hospital preparedness score
for different emergency scenarios
The overall preparedness scores of the hospitals for
MCE, MTE, and biological events ranged from 32 to
100. The average preparedness scores and standard
deviations for the different types of emergency scenarios
are presented in Figure 1. Inter-rater reliability was high,
ranging from 95.3% to 99.2%.
Medium relationships were found between the pre￾paredness scores of the hospitals for the different emer￾gency scenarios, as follows: 1) between MCE and MTE
(.548, p = 0.006); 2) between MCE and a biological event
(.541, p = .009); and between MTE and a biological event
(.458, p = .032).
Relationships between categories to total hospital
preparedness score for the various emergency scenarios
Table 2 presents the correlations between preparedness
of specific categories for each scenario with both overall
preparedness for that scenario and overall preparedness
for other emergency scenarios.
SOPs
Surprisingly, preparedness of SOPs for MCE was not
found to be related to overall preparedness for that same
scenario – MCE. Equally surprisingly, SOPs for MCE
were found to be moderately related to preparedness for
a different scenario – MTE. Preparedness of SOPs for
MTE strongly correlated with preparedness for MTE,
but did not correlate with preparedness for other emer￾gency scenarios. Preparedness of SOPs for biological
events strongly correlated with preparedness for a bio￾logical event, moderately correlated with preparedness
for MTE, and weakly correlated with MCEs.
Training and drills
A strong to very strong relationship was found between
training and drills and the total preparedness score
Figure 1 Average overall preparedness scores of all general hospitals for different emergency scenarios.

for the emergency scenarios. Regardless of the type
of training and drills that were conducted, their
scores correlated not only with preparedness for the
same specific type of emergency scenario, but also with
preparedness for other types of emergency scenarios.
The levels of correlations among training and drills
to the various types of emergencies are presented in
Table 2.
Knowledge of staff
Knowledge of healthcare personnel regarding MCE cor￾related with preparedness for all emergency scenarios:
MCE, MTE, and a biological event. Knowledge of
personnel regarding a biological event correlated only
with preparedness for an MCE.
Infrastructure and equipment
No significant relationships were found between infra￾structure and equipment for MCE and preparedness for
different emergency scenarios. Infrastructure and equip￾ment for MTE was strongly related with preparedness
for MTE. A moderate relationship was found between
infrastructure and equipment for a biological event and
preparedness for both MCE and biological events.
Discussion
Based on theory alone and research prior to this study,
one would not be able to conclude that preparedness for
one scenario would enhance preparedness for other
types of scenarios. At the same time, theory would sug￾gest that there might be common components in the
preparedness process for different emergency scenarios
[8, 20]. Given the fact that the process of preparing
healthcare professionals to manage emergencies is both
complicated and costly, it is important to optimize the
emergency preparedness program by investing resources
in the common components that may improve pre￾paredness for different emergency scenarios [20, 22].
The all-hazards approach provides a standardized ap￾proach for emergency preparedness, while still tending
to hazard-specific components [23].
Relationship between preparedness for different
emergency scenarios
This study has shown that preparedness to a specific
emergency is related to preparedness for other types of
emergencies, thus strengthening the adoption of an all￾hazards policy [2, 9]. It appears that when steps are car￾ried out to prepare for one emergency scenario, this also
influences the ability of the hospital to prepare for other
types of scenarios. Nevertheless, there is a need to ex￾plore to what degree preparedness to one emergency
enhances preparedness to other scenarios.
Relationships among specific categories with the total
preparedness score for different emergency scenarios
It is a well-accepted assumption that a standard operating
procedure is an essential requirement for emergency pre￾paredness [2]. The findings of this study suggest that pre￾paring an SOP might be especially important for scenarios
for which hospital personnel are less well prepared or
experienced [24]. A well-trained and experienced hospital
staff may need to rely less on an SOP when dealing with a
familiar emergency scenario, while in uncommon emer￾gency scenarios, when the roles and expectations are less
well known (as in mass toxicological events), a well￾developed SOP is vital.
The relationship between knowledge related to MCE
and preparedness for different types of scenarios would
seem to suggest that there is a common hub of

knowledge relevant to various emergency scenarios. The
principles for managing an MCE seem to serve as the
basis for other types of emergency preparedness pro￾grams [2], although scenario-specific knowledge must
also be provided.
Training personnel and conducting drills are import￾ant factors of the emergency preparedness process in all
scenarios [16]. Without the preparation of an SOP,
provision of knowledge and capabilities to healthcare
personnel, effective training, and drills, it is not possible
for a hospital to achieve emergency preparedness [14,
17]. This assumption was strongly supported by the
findings of this study.
Infrastructure and equipment were found to relate to
the total preparedness score for an MTE and a biological
event. This most probably is derived from the unique
requirements that are specific to these scenarios, such as
personal protective gear. Given that hospital staff is
likely to be unfamiliar with this equipment and infra￾structure, it is necessary for training programs to include
opportunities for staff to become adept in their use. In
contrast, infrastructure and equipment required for
MCEs are similar to what is routinely utilized in the
emergency department, and thus staff is well acquainted
with them. This might explain the lack of correlation be￾tween infrastructure and equipment with preparedness
for an MCE.
Limitations
Preparedness for radiological events in Israel is based on
the doctrine of admitting and treating toxicological cas￾ualties. A unique designated doctrine is relevant only to
seven referral hospitals. Therefore, the evaluation of pre￾paredness of this specific hazard was not included in the
study.
This study does not provide an answer to the ex￾tremely important question of how often exercises and
drills need to be held in order to assure retention of
knowledge and competencies. This should be further
investigated, as there tends to be an attrition of know￾ledge and skills fairly rapidly amongst staff who are not
routinely actively involved in emergency management.
While the findings of this study present the relationship
between hospitals' preparedness for different types of
emergencies, the study does not address the degree that
preparedness for one type of emergency actually
enhances preparedness for other emergency scenarios.
Rather than reflecting causal relationships in prepared￾ness across different types of emergencies, it might be
that these associations reflect a common causal factor,
such as strong leadership and/or strong commitment of
the hospital's management towards assuring effective
emergency preparedness and response.
Conclusions
The findings of this study present the relationship
between preparedness for different emergency scenar￾ios. There are fundamental critical building blocks
such as SOPs, training, and drills programs that im￾prove preparedness for different types of emergencies
more than other building blocks, such as equipment
or knowledge of personnel. Investing efforts in pro￾moting those components of the preparedness for one
scenario may contribute to improved preparedness for
other scenarios.
SOPs appear to be an important element in achieving
emergency preparedness, especially for emerging sce￾narios, while knowledge is the basis for managing famil￾iar emergencies. Policy makers should identify the
knowledge and skills that are relevant for different types
of scenarios, and emphasize them in the training
programs.
The findings of this study provide evidence-based sup￾port for the all-hazards approach to emergency pre￾paredness, particularly with regard to standard operating
procedures, training, and drills. Policy makers in the
field of emergency management should discourage the
healthcare systems from developing unique designated
plans for each type of emergency scenario, but rather
focus on identification of similar characteristics of vari￾ous crisis situations and invest efforts and resources on
preparing those components.
