Extract
Since the publication of “A Compendium of Strategies to Prevent
Healthcare-Associated Infections in Acute Care Hospitals” in 2008,
prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) has become a
national priority. Despite improvements, preventable HAIs continue
to occur. The 2014 updates to the Compendium were created to
provide acute care hospitals with up-to-date, practical, expert
guidance to assist in prioritizing and implementing their HAI
prevention efforts. They are the product of a highly collaborative
effort led by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America
(SHEA), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the
American Hospital Association (AHA), the Association for
Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and
The Joint Commission, with major contributions from
representatives of a number of organizations and societies with


content expertise, including the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI),
the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS), the Society for
Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), the Society for Hospital Medicine
(SHM), and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS).
