Abstract
Background: Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are rare mesenchymal tumors occurring in various
anatomic regions. Although diagnostic criteria and treatment management are not established, current treatment
options consist of surgery and chemotherapy including mTOR inhibitors.
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a non-invasive ablative treatment which has shown excellent control
rates for more common types of unresectable liver tumors and metastases. In this report we present a rare case of
PEComa of the liver that was treated by stereotactic radiotherapy followed by resection. Staging and evaluation of
treatment response was done by FDG-PET/CT. This case highlights the potential of SBRT as a neoadjuvant
treatment even for rare liver malignancies. It is the first case of liver PEComa treated by SBRT and resection.
Case presentation: A 52-year-old woman presented at an external hospital with abdominal pressure and pain in
the right upper abdominal quadrant. A CT scan showed a 700 cm3 liver lesion in segment IV. In repeated biopsy
in July 2015 histopathological workup showed a pleomorphic epitheloid tumor with small to medium sized cells
expressing vimentin and melan-A while being negative for cytokeratin establishing the diagnosis of PEComa of
the liver.
To achieve high, ablative doses a stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) technique was chosen consisting of
60Gy (biologically effective dose 105Gy) in 8 fractions of 7.5Gy. Radiotherapy planning was based on MRI
resulting in a planning target volume (PTV) of 1944 cm3
. Treatment toxicity was limited to a slight elevation
of transaminases (grade 1 and 3). A complete resection was performed 21 weeks after radiotherapy confirmed
by negative surgical margins.
At last follow-up 21 months after therapy, MRI showed neither local nor distant tumor recurrence. The patient
was in stable condition (ECOG 1) and without late radiation toxicity.
Conclusions: This is the first documented case of liver PEComa treated by SBRT and resection. A favorable
post-treatment course demonstrates that SBRT is a potential neoadjuvant treatment that is capable of
reducing an inoperable rare liver tumor to a resectable lesion.

Background
Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are rare
mesenchymal tumors for which diagnostic criteria and
treatment management are not yet established [1]. The term
PEComa was first introduced in 1996 by Zamboni and
Bonetti who suggested the name PEComa for neoplasms
composed of a pure proliferation of perivascular epithelioid
cells (PEC) [2]. Histological hallmarks are the presence of a
distinct cell type, known as “perivascular epitheloid cell”,
and the coexpression of smooth-muscle (actin and/or
desmin) and melanocytic markers (HMB-45 and/or melan
A) [3]. The etiology of PEComas remains uncertain. They
predominantly affect women and occur in nearly every
organ [4]. The incidence of benign and malignant PEComa
of the liver is much lower than for other locations [5].
In the WHO classification of soft tissue and bone
sarcomas (2002), PEComas are categorized in the
subgroup of “malignant tumors with uncertain differen￾tiation” [1]. To date, PEComa classification encompasses
angiomyolipomas (AML), lymphangioma, lymphangio￾leiomyomatosis (LAM), clear cell sugar tumors (CCST)
and not otherwise specified PEComas (NOS) [3].
PEComas manifest different biological behavior with
approximately one-third presenting with locally aggres￾sive behavior (malignant PEComa) [6].
Another characteristic of PEComas is their relation to
the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Similar gene mu￾tations in TSC1 and TSC2 genes have been demon￾strated in a number of PEComas. TSC genes seem to
have an important role in the regulation of the mTOR
pathway. Selectively inhibiting mTOR pathways has
shown efficacy in malignant PEComa [7].
Folpe et al. developed a risk stratification based on
pathological findings and risk factors to classify PEComa
into “benign”, “of uncertain malignant potential” and
“malignant” (Fig. 1) [2].
Neither diagnostic criteria nor treatment management
are established. The definitive diagnosis is obtained by
biopsy. Imaging is used to determine the local extent
and for staging purposes [8]. Although pathognomonic
imaging-based features of PEComas have not been
defined, most commonly used imaging methods include
computer tomography (CT) and ultrasound. PET/CT
has no role in the diagnosis of PEComa. The mainstay of
therapy is resection. Some PEComas are adequately
treated by complete resection; however, the therapy
management of tumors of unknown malignant potential
or inoperable tumors remains unclear. Adjuvant treat￾ment in addition to surgery has been reported for only a
few patients. An extensive review of treatment strategies
of 234 cases reported that nearly all patients were
treated with surgery; only 2 patients presented with
unresectable disease [4]. Very few (6 cases) received neo￾adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy alone 2 patients,
chemotherapy alone 3 patients and radiochemotherapy 1
patient) and only 18% of patients received adjuvant ther￾apy after resection (8 patients radiotherapy, 2 patients
radiochemotherapy). The review highlighted the
diversity of treatment protocols, histologic heterogeneity
and diverse follow up intervals, as well as the natural
history of the disease. Based on this review no final con￾clusions or treatment recommendations can be given.
Inoperability of the tumor was generally associated with
a poor outcome. Four out of five cases of unresectable

PEComa due to tumor size or metastatic disease
proceeded fatal, one case of malignant epitheloid
angiomyolipoma showed a good response to systemic
therapy with an mTOR-inhibitor for 7 months of follow￾up [9–13].
The role of mTOR-inhibitors in the treatment of
malignant PEComa is not clear. mTOR-inhibitors are
recommended for treatment of TSC associated renal
angiomyolipoma based on three clinical trials reporting
a prolonged response rate in approximately 58% of
patients with renal and associated hepatic AML [14–16].
We report on a case of inoperable hepatic PEComa
that was treated by neoadjuvant radiotherapy followed
by resection. FDG-PET/CT was used for staging and
evaluation of treatment response.
Case presentation
A 52-year-old woman presented at an external hospital
with a chief complaint of abdominal pressure and pain in
the right upper abdominal quadrant. A CT scan revealed a
700 cm3 liver lesion in segment IV. Hepatocellular carcin￾oma, metastasis or cholangiocellular carcinoma were ex￾cluded by biopsy but no definite diagnosis could be
established. Subsequently, she was referred to our cancer
center for further evaluation and management.
In July 2015 the histopathological workup of a
repeated biopsy showed a pleomorphic epitheloid tumor
with small to medium sized cells. On immunohisto￾chemistry, the tumor cells expressed vimentin and
melan-A, but were negative for cytokeratin. Proliferative
activity was very high measured by MIB-1/KI-67 (Fig. 2).
A diagnosis of PEComa of the liver was clearly estab￾lished. The lesion was classified as a malignant PEComa
according to the Folpe classification because of its size
(> 5 cm) and more than 1 risk factor (high proliferative
activity, nuclear pleomorphism, multinuclear giant cells).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen
showed progression of the tumor to 1280 cm3 within
26 days after initial CT (Fig. 3). FDG-PET/CT showed no
evidence of distant metastasis. Due to tumor size and inva￾sion of the inferior vena cava, the tumor was deemed unre￾sectable and the multidisciplinary tumor board
recommended neoadjuvant radiotherapy. To achieve high,
ablative doses a stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
technique was chosen consisting of 8 fractions of 7.5Gy
prescribed to the 80% isodose to a total dose of 60Gy

(biologically effective dose 105Gy; BED = total dose*(1+
dose per fraction/α/β) for α/β = 10 Gy) given every other
day. The patient was immobilized in a vacuum bag using
abdominal compression. Radiotherapy planning was based
on a 4D planning CT and MRI resulting in a target volume
(PTV) of 1944 cm3
. A treatment margin of 4 mm was used
around the GTV to create the PTV. Dose constraints for
organs at risk were used as published elsewhere [17]. The
whole liver had a volume of 3709 cm3 and 3330 cm3
received
a dose below 15 Gy. Treatment toxicity was limited to a
slight elevation of transaminases (grade 1 and 3).
To evaluate efficacy of treatment, FDG-PET/CT was
repeated (week 8, 17) showing no change in tumor size,
but a reduction of SUVmax at 8 weeks and substantial re￾duction in tumor volume (49%) at 17 weeks post SBRT.
At the multidisciplinary tumor board, the patient was
deemed operable because of the significant downsizing
effect. A complete resection was performed 21 weeks
after radiotherapy consisting of an extended
hemihepatectomy [segments 1, 4-8), tangential resection
of the retrohepatic cava, and biliodigestive anastomosis
via end to side technique (Roux-Y). There were no
intraoperative complications. The postoperative course
was complicated by sepsis, wound healing problems
and weight loss. Histological and immunochemistry
findings were consistent with the diagnosis of PEComa
showing more than 80% necrosis corresponding to a
pathological response after SBRT. Surgical margins
were negative.
At last follow-up 21 months after therapy, MRI
showed neither local nor distant tumor recurrence. The
patient was in stable condition (ECOG 1) with no symp￾toms of late radiation toxicity.
Discussion
The term “PEComa” unifies a multitude of rare, histo￾logically diverse tumor types, which can occur in almost
every organ with a predominance of pelvic organs.

In the presented case a PEComa of the liver was diag￾nosed by CT scan and subsequent biopsy. Following the
criteria outlined by Folpe et al. the lesion was classified
as a malignant hepatic PEComa demonstrating a rapid
progression almost doubling its size within one month.
Additional imaging with MRI revealed an inhomogen￾eous, intrahepatic mass with marked restriction of diffu￾sion, compression of the biliary tract and intrahepatic
cholestasis. A PET/CT that was ordered for staging
purposes and for radiotherapy planning showed a huge
liver lesion with moderate to marked, inhomogeneous
PET tracer enhancement. After pathologic workup
resulted in the diagnosis of PEComa the patient was
treated with neoadjuvant SBRT followed by resection.
Few, small case series describe morphologic imaging
characteristics of hepatic PEComa on CT, MRI or ultra￾sound. Radiologic characteristics that can differentiate
between a benign liver lesion (e.g. angiomyolipoma) and
PEComa with malignant potential have not been identi￾fied so far. In summary hepatic PEComa frequently
present as a solitary, well-circumscribed heterogeneous
mass in patients with no underlying liver disease.
Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI showed the lesions
were significantly and heterogeneously enhanced on
arterial phase, less enhanced on portal venous phase,
and slightly hypodense on delayed phase [18–20]. These
features can make it difficult to distinguish PEComa and
hepatocellular carcinoma by enhancement pattern and
final diagnosis always needs to be obtained by histology.
The few published reports on the role of FDG-PET/CT
are discordant regarding its role in diagnosis and staging.
It is supposed that benign PEComas are not showing a
significant tracer uptake. A report of 12 patients by Young
et al. showed that benign LAM lesions were not detectable
by FDG PET/CT [21]. Other reports demonstrated FDG￾PET avidity in hepatic, adrenal und retroperitoneal AML
[22–25]. Unfortunately, since the tumors were not classi￾fied according to the FOLPE-criteria, it is unclear which
subtypes of PEComas were FDG-avid. Several studies
report that both primary and metastatic malignant PECo￾mas (NOS) of the uterus, retroperitoneum and bone were
detectable by FDG-PET/CT [13–18, 26–28]. Sun et al.
described FDG-uptake of metastases of a malignant
uterine PEComa in multiple sites including lung and liver
with maximum standardized uptake values (SUV max)
between 6.5 and 12.1.
Precise therapeutic guidelines do not exist. Resection
with clear margins is the treatment option of choice for

resectable tumors, because even benign lesions can show
aggressive growth tendency. Additional or further treat￾ment options such as chemotherapy, therapy with
mTOR-Inhibitors or radiation therapy have to be
explored more intensively.
Hepatic manifestation of PEComa is rare. Table 1
shows 21 cases reported in the literature. All except one
case were resectable and the primary treatment was
operation. Of 18 cases with available follow up informa￾tion, 14 were recurrence free, although follow up was
short and one patient died shortly after the operation.
Another study reported on 94 cases which were treated
by surgery [29]. No recurrence was observed during the
follow up period. The authors recommend surgery to
avoid spontaneous rupture and compression if the
tumor is larger than 5 cm.
There is limited data for the use of radiotherapy in the
treatment of PEComa. Only four cases are reported in
the literature and no data on the radiosensibility of PEC
is available. In one case of a PEComa of the upper
extremity, RT of 50 Gy was given preoperatively [30].
The other cases are in the postoperative setting using
doses of 45-60 Gy. One patient experienced recurrent
disease after 6 months, the others had no evidence of
disease (NED) after 17 and 15 months [31–33].
We present the first case of neoadjuvant SBRT with an
ablative dose in a malignant liver PEComa and achieved
conversion to resectability with this strategy. Although
surgeons were concerned about possible intraoperative
complications caused by radiotherapy effects on the liver
parenchyma, no intraoperative complications, such as
extensive bleeding, occurred. PET/CT was used for
staging purposes and for evaluation of treatment
response of the FDG avid tumor. This seems to be a
good strategy for PEComas showing PET tracer positiv￾ity at initial imaging.
Conclusion
PEComa is a rare tumor that can display both benign as
well as malignant characteristics. Resection is the treat￾ment option of choice for resectable cases. We safely
applied SBRT as a neoadjuvant therapeutic strategy to
turn an inoperable primary hepatic PEComa into a
resectable lesion. Preoperative radiotherapy is a potential
treatment paradigm for inoperable PEComas of the liver
as well as in other anatomic regions.
