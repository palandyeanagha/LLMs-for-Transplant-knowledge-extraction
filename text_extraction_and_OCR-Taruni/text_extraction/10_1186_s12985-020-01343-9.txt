Hepatitis E virus infection during
pregnancy
Chunchen Wu, Xiaoxue Wu and Jianbo Xia*
Abstract
Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) generally causes self-limiting viral hepatitis. However, in pregnant women, HEV
infection can be severe and has been associated with up to 30% mortality in the third trimester. Additionally, HEV
infection in pregnancy is also associated with high rates of preterm labor and vertical transmission.
Main body: HEV is now recognized as a global health problem in both developing and industrialized countries.
HEV can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, zoonotic route, and blood transfusion route. An altered immune
status, hormonal levels, and viral factors may be related to the severity of the disease. Currently, no established
treatment is available for HEV in pregnant women. A Chinese vaccine has been demonstrated to be protective
against HEV in the general population and seems to be safe in pregnancy; however, its safety and efficacy in a
large population of pregnant women remain to be determined.
Conclusion: This review summarizes the current knowledge about HEV infection during pregnancy and focuses on
the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, mechanisms underlying severe liver injury, and management and
prevention of HEV infection during pregnancy. Considering that HEV infection during pregnancy may result in poor
outcomes, screening for and monitoring HEV infection early in pregnancy should be taken into account. In
addition, a better understanding of the pathogenesis will help to develop potential treatment strategies targeting
HEV infection in pregnancy.

Background
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a hepatotropic infectious agent
that generally causes self-limiting acute hepatitis in healthy
adults and chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised indi￾viduals [1]. Annually, there are an estimated 20 million
HEV infections, 3.3 million symptomatic hepatitis E cases,
and 60,000 deaths worldwide [1, 2]. In addition to hepatic
manifestations, extrahepatic manifestations, including pan￾creatitis, neurological symptoms, hematological disorders,
glomerulonephritis, and mixed cryoglobulinemia have been
associated with HEV infection [1, 3]. HEV is classified into
8 major genotypes, with genotypes 1–4 being the
predominant strains involved in human infections. Geno￾types 1 (HEV-1) and 2 (HEV-2) infect only humans and are
transmitted via the fecal-oral route [1, 4], whereas geno￾types 3 (HEV-3) and 4 (HEV-4) are zoonotic and are
contracted through the consumption of undercooked pork
and wild boar meat [5]. Although swine are the most com￾monly implicated source of HEV-3 and HEV-4, other ani￾mals including shellfish, deer, and rabbits can serve as a
source of infection [4, 6–9]. Therefore, HEV-1 and HEV-2
are often associated with epidemics in developing countries
due to poor hygiene and sanitation. In contrast, HEV-3 and
HEV-4 are prevalent in industrialized countries and are as￾sociated with sporadic and clustered cases of hepatitis E in
these regions [1, 4]. In recent years, the transmission of
HEV-3 and HEV-4 through blood transfusions has been in￾creasingly reported in Europe [1, 4, 10], prompting many

countries to consider the screening of blood products for
HEV [11]. For these reasons, HEV is now recognized as a
global health problem in both developing and industrialized
countries [1, 12]. Current therapeutics used to treat HEV
infection include the nucleoside analog ribavirin and
interferon-α (IFN-α). Ribavirin therapy can be fairly effi￾cient in most cases of chronic hepatitis E [1, 2, 13, 14]. In
some specific situations, interferon has also been used suc￾cessfully [2]. However, until now, there have been no spe￾cific direct-acting antiviral agents against HEV, particularly
for pregnant women [1, 15]. A recombinant hepatitis E vac￾cine, HEV 239, has been demonstrated to be well tolerated
and effective in the prevention of hepatitis E in China; how￾ever, it is currently only approved for use in China and is
not yet available elsewhere [2, 16, 17].
HEV infection can cause fulminant hepatitis failure
(FHF), especially in pregnant women, with a mortality
rate of up to 30% [1, 18–20]. In addition, HEV can be
vertically transmitted from infected mothers to their in￾fants, with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality
[20–22]. Ribavirin and IFN-α are contraindicated in
pregnancy because of the risk of teratogenicity [23–25].
Therefore, only supportive care is provided for pregnant
women with HEV infection. In this review, we provide a
summary of the current knowledge regarding HEV and
highlight HEV infection during pregnancy, which has
been poorly understood until now and deserves the ut￾most attention.
Main text
Molecular virology of HEV
HEV belongs to the family of Hepeviridae and is the sole
member of the genus Orthohepevirus. HEV is icosahe￾dral in shape and can exist in both nonenveloped and
enveloped (eHEV) forms, with diameters of approxi￾mately 30 nm and 40 nm, respectively [1, 12]. These two
forms of HEV particles may be transmitted via different
routes and possess distinct characteristics in the viral life
cycle [1, 12]. The HEV genome is a single-stranded,
positive-sense, linear RNA that is approximately 7.2 kb
in length [26]. The RNA genome consists of a 5′ un￾translated region (UTR), three open reading frames
(ORFs) and a 3′ UTR. ORF1 comprises approximately
70% of the genome (5109 bp) and encodes nonstructural
polyproteins, such as methyltransferase (Met), Y-domain
(Y), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) [27], hypervari￾able region (HVR) [28], macrodomain (X), RNA helicase
(Hel) [29, 30] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) [31, 32], those are necessary for replication [1,
17, 33]. ORF2 and ORF3 partially overlap and are trans￾lated from a single subgenomic RNA [34]. ORF2 en￾codes both glycosylated ORF2 antigen and viral capsid
protein [35, 36]. ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional
phosphoprotein that is required for virus egress from
cells and proposed to perturb numerous cellular path￾ways [12, 17] (Fig. 1).
The study of HEV replication has been limited to effi￾cient cell culture systems, and replication within the host
is not yet fully understood. The HEV capsid protein is
believed to be essential for binding to an unknown cellu￾lar receptor to initiate viral entry [37]. The eHEV may
have a distinct mechanism of viral entry, considering
that it is enveloped and capsid protein is not exposed on
the surface [38]. After entering the target cell, the virus
is uncoated, and the viral RNA genome is released into
the cytoplasm. Following this, viral nonstructural pro￾teins are translated from ORF1 [39]. A negative-sense
intermediate RNA is synthesized based on the positive￾sense viral RNA genome with the help of RdRp; this
product, in turn, serves as a template to produce 7.2-kb
positive-sense progeny viral RNA as well as 2.2-kb sub￾genomic RNA [31, 40]. Subsequently, the subgenomic
RNA acts as a template to translate capsid proteins and
phosphoproteins [37]. The genomic RNA is contained
within the capsid proteins, and new virions are gener￾ated and finally released by mechanisms still unclear [17,
41].
Epidemiology of HEV infection in pregnancy
HEV infection is associated with high incidence and
mortality (principally due to fulminant hepatitis) in preg￾nant women according to the majority of clinical studies
and case reports from developing countries [1, 4, 10, 42].
A prospective field study carried out by Khuroo et al.
showed that hepatitis E developed in 36 (17.3%) of 208
pregnant women, as compared to 71 (2.1%) of 3350 non￾pregnant women and 107 (2.8%) of 3822 men. FHF de￾veloped in 8 (22.2%) of the 36 pregnant women with
hepatitis E. In contrast, none of the nonpregnant women
showed the occurrence of fulminant hepatic failure [43].
For the first time, this study revealed that the incidence
of hepatitis E and fulminant rates were higher in preg￾nant women than nonpregnant women and men. In an￾other study, HEV infection was observed in 57.5 and
46% of pregnant and nonpregnant women, respectively.
Moreover, 58% of the HEV-infected pregnant women
developed FHF. The mortality rate was highest (56%)
among HEV-infected FHF cases during the third trimes￾ter of pregnancy [44]. This study indicated that pregnant
women, especially those in the second and third trimes￾ters, are more commonly affected during epidemics than
the general population [42]. Various studies from differ￾ent regions of the Indian subcontinent reported that the
prevalence rate of HEV in acute viral hepatitis during
pregnancy ranged from 58 to 86% [44–46]. HEV infec￾tion can result in up to 30% mortality among pregnant
women in their third trimester [1, 18–20]. HEV-1 and
HEV-2 are likely responsible for most of the HEV

outbreaks because they are the most prevalent genotypes
in developing countries [10, 42]. Additionally, HEV in￾fection in pregnancy is also associated with high rates of
preterm labor and vertical transmission [10, 47, 48]. The
frequent occurrence of other complications, such as dis￾seminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), is also associ￾ated with HEV infection in pregnant women [4]. For
industrialized countries, there are few reported cases in
pregnant women [49–51]; HEV-3 and HEV-4 are associ￾ated with these cases [50, 51]. Unlike HEV-1 and HEV￾2, HEV-3 and HEV-4 do not appear to cause fatal infec￾tions with fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women [10,
49]. However, considering that the limitation of these
studies was the small number of cases, other studies are
needed to clarify this result.
China is an epidemic area for HEV, and HEV-4 is cur￾rently the dominant cause of hepatitis E [52, 53]. HEV
infection has considerable potential for transmission in
pregnant women in China. It was estimated that the
positivity rates of anti-HEV IgM and anti-HEV IgG were
2.6 and 16.2%, respectively, in pregnant women from
Shandong Province and 0.6 and 11.1%, respectively, in
pregnant women from Jiangsu Province, China [54, 55].
In contrast, the positivity rate of anti-HEV IgM was
2.56% in pregnant women in Yunnan Province [56].
These results may reflect the varied seroprevalence of
HEV infection in different areas of China. In addition,
anti-HEV IgM seropositivity occurs first and persists for
3–5 months after the initial disease onset [57, 58].
Shortly after the appearance of IgM, IgG antibodies
develop seropositivity and persist throughout the acute
and convalescent phases, maintaining high levels for a
year [59]. Therefore, seroprevalence to HEV in pregnant
women does not necessarily reflect current HEV￾positivity and may result from infection and clearance
prior to becoming pregnant. Furthermore, besides the
factors related to sex, age structure, and sampling errors,
the differences in the specificity and sensitivity of HEV
detection attributable to different laboratory diagnostic
techniques should also be considered [55, 60]. A recent
study among pregnant women in Qinhuangdao, China,
showed that the positivity rates of anti-HEV IgM and/or
anti-HEV IgG were significantly higher in the third tri￾mester than in the first and second trimesters [61], con￾sistent with previous reports. Among these pregnant
women, the HEV strain exclusively identified in those
with a history of HEV infection was HEV-4 [61], which
seemingly coincides with the fact that HEV-4 is now the
most prevalent strain in China. However, considering
that HEV-1 and HEV-3 have also been reported in
China [62, 63], more studies are needed to clarify the
HEV genotypes prevalent among pregnant women in
China and the correlation between HEV genotypes and
maternal and fetal outcomes.
The combination of other virus infections with HEV
infection may enhance the mortality rate. It is estimated
that in patients suffering from chronic liver disease (e.g.,
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection), these infections often
progress to liver failure, with a mortality rate of 27% [64,
65]. Our unpublished data suggested that there were

3′ UTR. ORF1 comprises approximately 70% of the genome (5109 bp) and encodes nonstructural polyproteins, such as methyltransferase (Met), Y￾domain (Y), PCP, hypervariable region (HVR), macrodomain (X), RNA helicase (Hel) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which are
necessary for replication. ORF2 and ORF3 partially overlap and are translated from a single subgenomic RNA that is approximately 2.2 kb in
length. ORF2 encodes a viral capsid protein that is required for viral entry, assembly and immunogenicity. ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional

increased rates of other virus infections in both anti￾HEV IgM- and anti-HEV IgG-positive pregnant women.
In pregnant women with chronic hepatitis C virus
(HCV) coinfection, a marked increase in anti-HEV IgG
seropositivity and a significant worsening of the bio￾chemical liver indices have been observed [66]. There￾fore, more efforts are needed to investigate the
epidemiology of other virus infections combined with
HEV infection in pregnancy.
Clinical manifestations
Acute hepatitis E
According to previous data, the clinical manifestations
of HEV infection are different, varying from asymptom￾atic to fulminant hepatic failure. HEV usually causes an
acute self-limiting hepatitis. The prodromal phase lasts
up to 1 week, and the symptoms may be nonspecific,
such as malaise, fever, joint pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Subsequently, a series of typical symptoms related to
acute icteric hepatitis, including jaundice, darkened
urine, and pale stools may occur, similar to those seen in
HAV infection [67]. However, compared with HAV, pa￾tients with HEV are known to have prolonged cholesta￾sis [68]. Mansuy et al. [69] studied 62 confirmed cases of
acute hepatitis E over a 5 year period in south-west
France and found that about 60% of patients became
jaundiced. In fact, the jaundice rate of acute HEV infec￾tion is likely much lower given that most cases are not
recognized or diagnosed. Serum alanine aminotransfer￾ase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels
are markedly elevated, and bilirubin levels can also rise
[10, 70]. In immunocompetent individuals, the infection
and symptoms typically resolve spontaneously within 4–
6 weeks [71]. Compared to nonpregnant women, clinical
features do not differ in pregnant women at first [72].
However, acute liver failure can develop rapidly in pa￾tients with HEV infection during pregnancy. Several
complications of fulminant hepatic failure, including
cerebral edema, DIC, and encephalopathy, appear to
occur at a higher rate [18]. Hepatic encephalopathy is
the most common cause of death among these patients
[72, 73]. Besides maternal mortality, fetal mortality can
occur, especially during the third trimester. Preterm de￾livery, low birth weight, and stillbirth of the fetus or
newborn have also been observed in these patients [72].
Chronic hepatitis E
Chronic HEV infection is defined as an HEV viremia for
more than 3 months [74]. In immunocompromised indi￾viduals who receive immunosuppressive therapy following
solid organ transplantation or stem cell transplantation
[75–77] and those with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection [78, 79] or with hematological malignancy
[80–82], chronic HEV infection may develop. This disease
course of chronic infection has mainly been reported
for HEV-3 and 4, leading to life-threatening liver fi￾brosis and cirrhosis [75, 80, 83–85]. It has been re￾ported that HEV-3 can cause acute hepatitis E in
pregnant women, followed by rapid clearance without
any signs of severe courses [50, 51].
Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis E
Acute or chronic or previous HEV infection can cause ex￾trahepatic manifestations [86, 87], which include a range
of neurological symptoms and impaired kidney function
associated with cryoglobulinemia [84, 88]. Other extrahe￾patic manifestations documented in the literature include
acute thyroiditis [89], thrombocytopenia [90], and acute
pancreatitis [91]. However, it remains uncertain whether
extrahepatic manifestations of HEV are attributed to dir￾ect infection of extrahepatic tissues or cross-reactive im￾mune responses. As of now, the molecular mechanism of
extrahepatic tissue injury caused by HEV infection is un￾clear, and the roles of pathogenic genotypes and immune
function remain to be identified.
Mechanisms underlying severe liver injury due to HEV
infection during pregnancy
The mechanisms of severe liver injury due to HEV infec￾tion in pregnant women are unknown. According to
previous studies, the unique characteristics of pregnant
women, such as altered immunity, hormone levels, and
viral factors, such as HEV genome heterogeneity and
variants, may be related to the severity of the disease
[19, 42] (Fig. 2).
Immunity
During pregnancy, the maternal immune system must
balance the need to maintain robust immune reactivity
to protect both the mother and fetus from invading
pathogens and tolerate highly immunogenic paternal al￾loantigens to sustain fetal integrity [92]. Therefore, the
immune alterations that occur during pregnancy are
considerably complex. A longitudinal study showed that
compared to the postpartum period, the number and ac￾tivity of natural killer (NK) and T cells decrease during
pregnancy, while monocytes, granulocytes, and dendritic
cells (DCs) increase in peripheral blood during preg￾nancy [93], suggesting that adaptive immune responses
are weakened, while innate immune responses are
strengthened during pregnancy [93–95]. Additionally, a
shift from a Th1-dominated immune response to a Th2-
dominated response, known as a “Th2 bias”, during
pregnancy has been proposed [96]. Th2 cells stimulate B
lymphocytes and increase antibody production but in￾hibit the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, leading to
impaired cell-mediated immunity [96]. In view of these
points, the pregnant mother and the fetus may be
Wu et al. Virology Journal (2020) 17:73 Page 4 of 11

protected from susceptibility to initial infection. How￾ever, once infected, pathogen clearance may be impaired,
resulting in increased severity of the disease, especially
for infections such as influenza, cytomegalovirus (CMV),
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), varicella- zos￾ter, malaria, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection,
in which cell-mediated immunity is important [93, 97].
Regarding the regulation of cellular immunity during
pregnancy, the Th1 / Th2 paradigm has been expanded
into the Th1 / Th2 / Th17 and Treg cell paradigm to
better explain the mechanism by which the fetus is not
rejected by maternal immune cells [98]. The function of
effector T cells, such as Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, is reg￾ulated by CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells [99, 100]. Therefore,
although the Th1/Th2 paradigm is useful, a host of im￾portant immune elements operates during pregnancy to
regulate systemic Th1 responses, including higher fre￾quencies of T regulatory cells.
The immunological mechanisms underlying severe
liver injury due to HEV infection in pregnancy are not
yet well understood. It has been reported that liver in￾jury resulting from HEV in the general population is due
to immune-activated CD8, NK and NKT cells in the
liver as well as in peripheral circulation [86, 101–103].
In HEV-positive pregnant patients with FHF, CD4 + T
cell counts were lower, CD8 + T cell counts were higher
and CD4+/CD8+ ratios were significantly lower than
those in HEV-negative pregnant women or in controls
with FHF [104]. However, the role of NK and NKT cells
in the pathogenesis of FHF in pregnant women remains
unknown. Moreover, although Th2 bias was confirmed
to exist in pregnant women with HEV infection, its ef￾fect on the severity of HEV infection is unknown [86].
Impaired monocyte-macrophage functions and defect￾ive Toll-like receptor signaling have been found in HEV￾infected pregnant women with ALF, suggesting that in￾adequate triggers for innate immune responses may con￾tribute to the development and severity of liver injury
due to HEV infection in pregnancy [86, 105]. In preg￾nant patients with FHF due to HEV, the DNA-binding
activity of NF-κB was much higher than those in non￾pregnant women and women with acute viral hepatitis
(AVH) without FHF. An analysis of the NF-κB complex
showed that the expression of p65 was completely ab￾sent or dramatically decreased in these patients [106].
High concentrations of cytokines, including TNF-α, IL￾6, IFN-γ, and TGF-β1, may also be related to adverse
pregnancy outcomes [107]. Therefore, the abnormal
Fig. 2 Mechanisms underlying severe liver injury due to HEV infection in pregnancy. The altered status of immunity, hormone levels and viral
factors may be related to the severity of the disease. Viral factors include HEV genome heterogeneity and variants, as well as viral proteins, such
as MFP, encoded by HEV ORF3, may be associated with the severity of the disease. Host immune factors, such as CD8+ T cells, NK and NKT cells,
may be involved in the pathogenicity of HEV during pregnancy. In addition, some cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TGF-β1, may also be
involved in this process. The dramatically elevated levels of hormonal factors, including progesterone, estrogen and HCG, in pregnancy may also
contribute to liver injury. Other host factors, such as nutritional status, may also influence the severity of HEV infection in pregnant women
Wu et al. Virology Journal (2020) 17:73 Page 5 of 11

expression or functioning of immunological factors
may cause deregulated immunity and severe liver
damage in the context of HEV infection. Other host
factors, such as nutritional status, including micronu￾trient deficiencies and the lack of folic acid, may also
influence the immune response to HEV infection in
pregnant women [108–111].
Hormonal factors
As pregnancy progresses, the levels of hormonal factors,
such as progesterone, estrogen and human chorionic go￾nadotropin (HCG), change dramatically and are consid￾erably higher than at any other time [96, 112, 113],
potentially also contributing to poor outcomes. The
levels of the three hormonal factors were found to be
higher in HEV-positive pregnant FHF patients than in
HEV-negative patients or controls [104]. Increased estra￾diol in the serum of HEV-infected pregnant women pro￾moted viral replication [114, 115], which may be
associated with poor outcomes [86]. In addition, a high
level of estrogen was found to be related to preterm de￾livery, low birth weight infants and fetal mortality
through placental dysfunction in pregnant women with
HEV infection [116].
Many studies have shown that hormonal factors play
an important role in the modulation of the immune sys￾tem. For example, high levels of progesterone and estro￾gen can alter the balance between Th1 and Th2
responses [96]. Estrogen also directly reduces CD8 T cell
cytotoxicity [94]. Moreover, estrogen can alter B cell sur￾vival and activation as well as suppress B cell lymphopoiesis
during pregnancy [94]. Progesterone receptor (PR) gene
mutations (PROGINS) were reported to be associated with
the incidence of FHF in pregnancy. Progesterone-induced
blocking factor (PIBF), which exerts antiabortive activity by
inhibiting NK cells and influencing both humoral and cellu￾lar immune responses, along with PR was found to be de￾creased in women with FHF [86, 117].
Viral factors
Genome heterogeneity and HEV variants According
to the epidemiology of HEV infection, there were varia￾tions in the rates of maternal morbidity and mortality
among the different HEV genotypes. According to
current data, HEV-1 and HEV-2 are the most common
genotypes associated with morbidity and mortality in
pregnancy. In contrast, the association of increased inci￾dence and severity of hepatitis E in pregnant women in￾fected with HEV-1 or HEV-2 is not observed for HEV-3
and HEV-4 [10, 49–51, 118, 119]. A recent study in an
ex vivo model using organ culture from the maternal de￾cidua and fetal placenta demonstrated that HEV-1 repli￾cated more efficiently at the maternal-fetal interface,
produced more infectious progeny virions, and caused
more severe tissue alterations than HEV-3 [120]. These
results indicate that the HEV genotype may play an im￾portant role in the pathogenicity of HEV, especially dur￾ing pregnancy. However, due to the lack of appropriate
in vivo and in vitro experimental models and the diffi￾culty of propagating the virus in vitro, no studies have
systematically compared the susceptibility, infectivity,
replication ability, and virulence of the different HEV
genotypes.
In addition, genetic HEV variants have shown to affect
viral morphogenesis, pathogenesis, clinical outcomes,
and antiviral resistance [121–123]. However, it remains
unknown whether these variants have been linked to
morbidity/mortality in pregnancy, and needs further
study.
Viral proteins The detailed functions of the viral pro￾teins in HEV infection and pathogenesis remain unclear.
The D29N and V27A mutations in ORF1-encoded Met
were significantly associated with poor outcomes in
acute liver failure patients [124]. V239A mutation in
ORF1-encoded Hel identified in severe hepatitis cases
might be associated with increased virulence of the
genotype 3 virus [125]. ORF1-encoded macrodomain
can inhibit the phosphorylation/activation of interferon
regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), thus possibly combating the
host antiviral response [126]. In addition, the macrodo￾main can interact with the light chain subunit of human
ferritin and inhibit its secretion, suggesting its possible
role in suppressing the innate immune response [127].
These reports suggest the possible involvement of
ORF1-encoded proteins in determining the outcome of
HEV infections. Besides ORF1, the ORF2-encoded cap￾sid protein can also antagonize IFN induction by block￾ing the phosphorylation of IRF-3 via interaction with the
multiprotein complex consisting of mitochondrial
antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), TANK-binding kin￾ase 1 (TBK1), and IRF3 [128]. Recently published data
showed that another ORF2-encoded protein, which is
glycosylated and can be secreted into the patient serum
or supernatants of HEV-infected cell culture in the form
of a dimer, inhibits antibody-mediated neutralization
and thus may lead to immune escape [35]. These studies
revealed that ORF2-encoded proteins might be involved
in the interference and/or evasion of the hosts’ innate
immunity. In addition, some studies have shown that
capsid protein may play a role in facilitating HEV sur￾vival or replication in infected hepatocytes. For example,
capsid protein inhibits cellular NF-κB activity by block￾ing ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of IκBα
in human hepatoma cells, presumably enhancing sur￾vival of HEV-infected hepatocytes [129]. Moreover, the
capsid protein activates the pro-apoptotic gene CHOP
Wu et al. Virology Journal (2020) 17:73 Page 6 of 11

and anti-apoptotic heat shock proteins [130]. HEV
ORF3 is proposed to be responsible for HEV-associated
coagulopathy. ORF3-encoded proteins may interact with
several clotting-related pathways, leading to an imbal￾ance in coagulation and fibrinolysis [131].
Management of HEV infection during pregnancy
Ribavirin was classified in Pregnancy Category X by the
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) be￾cause of its embryocidal and teratogenic effects in ani￾mals [25, 132, 133] Thus, ribavirin is not recommended
for use in pregnant women. IFN-α was classified in Preg￾nancy Category C by the FDA, taking into account its
abortifacient effect in animals and adverse effects [133].
Therefore, IFN-α was not recommended to be adminis￾tered to pregnant women [23, 24]. Recently, sofosbuvir
showed antiviral activity against HEV both in vitro and
in vivo and thus may be a promising antiviral drug
against HEV in pregnancy as a pregnancy category B
drug [134, 135]. As far as other antiviral candidates are
concerned, interferon λ1–3 was shown to inhibit HEV
replication [136, 137]. The antisense peptide-conjugated
morpholino oligomers (PPMO) HP1, targeting a highly
conserved sequence in the start site region of ORF1, can
lead to a significant reduction in the levels of HEV RNA
and capsid protein, suggesting its potential as a promis￾ing antiviral candidate [138]. A recent study showed that
nucleoside analogs NITD008, 2′-C-methylguanosine
(2CMG), and the non-nucleoside inhibitor GPC-N114
can inhibit HEV in cell culture [139, 140]. However,
more controlled studies are needed before sofosbuvir
can be recommended for HEV infection in pregnancy.
For the other antiviral candidates mentioned above,
there is a long way to go. Therefore, the management of
HEV infection in pregnancy is currently supported by
diligent monitoring and intensive care [42].
Considering that there is no established treatment
available for HEV infection in pregnant women, prevent￾ing HEV infection in pregnancy may be the most im￾portant management strategy [141]. The Chinese
vaccine for HEV, HEV 239, has been demonstrated to be
protective against both HEV-1 and HEV-4 [122, 142]. In
healthy adults, three doses of HEV 239 (30 μg of purified
recombinant hepatitis E antigen absorbed to 0.8 mg of
aluminium hydroxide suspended in 0.5 mL of buffered
saline) were administered intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6
months and 100.0% vaccine efficacy was achieved [16].
HEV 239 also seems to be safe in pregnant women
[143]. In addition, in a rabbit model, two doses of 10 μg
or 5 μg HEV 239 vaccine administered intramuscularly
on weeks 0 and 4 not only serve to protect pregnant rab￾bits from HEV infection but also prevent HEV-related
adverse outcomes [144]. Although the safety and efficacy
of this vaccine in a large population of pregnant women
remain to be determined, this vaccine is promising for
HEV infection prevention in pregnancy and may thus
decrease HEV-associated morbidity and mortality. Be￾sides advocating for studies of HEV 239 vaccination dur￾ing pregnancy, it would also seem prudent to advocate
for vaccination of at-risk women of childbearing age in
endemic regions before they become pregnant. Recently,
a phase IV trial has been initiated to assess the effective￾ness, safety, and immunogenicity of the HEV 239 vac￾cine in women of childbearing age in rural Bangladesh,
where HEV infection is endemic [145].
Conclusions
HEV infection is not limited to certain developing coun￾tries; it is also endemic in many high-income countries
and is largely zoonotic in nature. Despite increasing
knowledge, many questions regarding HEV, especially
HEV infection during pregnancy, remain unanswered. In
addition to immune and hormonal factors, genome het￾erogeneity and HEV variants may be related to the se￾verity of HEV infection in pregnancy. Therefore, it may
be important to investigate the prevalent HEV genotypes
and their virulence as well as morbidity in pregnancy;
this information could be used to develop guidelines for
the intervention and management of HEV infection in
pregnancy. HEV can be transmitted via blood transfu￾sion. Increasing prevalence rates of HEV in voluntary
blood donors (VBDs) and transfusion-associated HEV
infections have been reported [1, 4, 10, 146]. Therefore,
screening donors for HEV RNA may need to be
considered.
Considering that HEV infection in pregnant women
may progress to fulminant hepatitis, especially in the
third trimester, with a high mortality rate, screening for
and monitoring HEV infection early in pregnancy should
become a focus. In addition, it is also necessary to in￾form pregnant women of the potential effects of HEV on
the fetus; they should be advised to avoid eating and
drinking contaminated food and water to prevent pos￾sible HEV exposure. An HEV vaccine may hold great
promise for reducing HEV-associated mortality in preg￾nant women. Finally, there is also a substantial need for
novel therapies to treat HEV in pregnancy.
