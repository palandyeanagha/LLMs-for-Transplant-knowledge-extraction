MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs that are 18–23 nucleotides long. Recently, plasma 
miRNAs were reported to be sensitive and specific biomarkers of various pathological conditions. In the pres￾ent study, we focused on miR-210, which is known to be induced by hypoxia and might therefore be an excel￾lent biomarker for congestive heart failure. Plasma miR-210 levels and expression levels in mononuclear cells 
and skeletal muscles were elevated in Dahl salt-sensitive rats with heart failure. We also assessed miR-210 
expression in patients with heart failure. The miR-210 expression levels in the mononuclear cells of patients 
with NYHA III and IV heart failure according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional clas￾sification system were significantly higher than those with NYHA II heart failure and controls. Although no 
significant correlation was observed between plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and plasma miR-210 
levels in patients with NYHA II heart failure, patients with an improved BNP profile at the subsequent hos￾pital visit were classified in a subgroup of patients with low plasma miR-210 levels. Plasma miR-210 levels 
may reflect a mismatch between the pump function of the heart and oxygen demand in the peripheral tissues, 
and be a new biomarker for chronic heart failure in addition to plasma BNP concentrations.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs, com￾prising approximately 18–23 nucleotides, which bind to the 
3′-untranslated region of mRNAs of protein-coding genes to 
downregulate their expression.1,2) miRNAs play an important 
role in various physiological and pathological processes.3,4)
So far, more than 1500 human miRNAs have been identified 
(http://www.mirbase.org). They are expressed in a tissue- or 
cell-specific manner.5) Most human protein-coding genes are 
thought to be targeted by miRNAs6,7) that appear to function 
as rheostats to fine tune protein output.8,9)
Recently, miRNAs were reported to be present in vari￾ous body fluids.3,10,11) More than 90 types of miRNAs have 
been detected in human sera using next-generation sequenc￾ing.10) Plasma miRNAs are embedded not only RNA-induced 
silencing complex (RISC) but also others, exosomes and/or 
microparticles.12–14) We recently reported that the plasma con￾centrations of myocardium-specific miRNAs are excellent bio￾markers of myocardial infarction.12,14) Other groups also report 
that plasma miRNAs are sensitive and specific biomarkers of 
various tissue injuries and pathological conditions.15–18)
The present study examined whether circulating miRNAs 
can be used as biomarkers in patients with heart failure. 
Recently, Tijsen et al. reported that circulating plasma 
miR-423-5p is most closely related to a clinical diagnosis of 
heart failure.17) Moreover, we reported that the plasma concen￾tration of miR-126 is negatively correlated with the severity of 
heart failure.19)
In the present study, we determined whether miR-210 is a 
biomarker for congestive heart failure. Chronic heart failure 
is characterized by insufficient oxygen supply to the periph￾eral tissues; miR-210 is highly induced by hypoxia. MiR-210 
has already attracted a great deal of attention as a biomarker 
for various diseases including breast cancer,20) acute cerebral 
ischemia,21) atherosclerosis obliterans,22) and acute kidney 
injury.23) Aberrantly accelerated proliferation and metabolism 
are typical characteristics of cancer cells, which lead to an 
imbalance between oxygen supply and consumption, causing 
hypoxia. Moreover, the obliteration of arteries or tissue injury 
exposes peripheral tissues to hypoxic conditions. In diseases 
with hypoxia, miR-210 might be a useful auxiliary biomarker 
(i.e., not for primary diagnosis). It has been established that 
miR-210 is specifically induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α
(HIF-1α) during hypoxia. In addition, miR-210 might repress 
iron–sulfur cluster assembly protein (ISCU), leading to the 
repression of mitochondrial respiration, reducing oxidative 
stress, which may protect cells from apoptosis.24)
In the present study, miRNA array analysis revealed 
miR-210 is elevated in the plasma of rats with heart failure. 
We confirmed that miR-210 is upregulated by hypoxia in rat 
myocardial cells (H9c2) and tested the hypothesis that the 
expression level of miR-210 increases in the peripheral tissues 
of rats with heart failure. Finally, we examined the possibility 
of miR-210 as a biomarker for heart failure in human patients.
Materials and Methods
Rat Heart Failure Model ​Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a 
high-salt diet for 8 weeks showed a systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) exceeding 220mmHg, markedly elevated plasma brain 
natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, marked cardiac hypertro￾phy, and massive proteinuria and were, therefore, considered 
to have chronic heart failure condition in accordance with 
previous reports.25–27) Male Dahl salt-sensitive rats (4 weeks 
old) were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The 
rats were housed in a temperature-controlled room on a 12-h 
light/12-h dark cycle and fed low (control group: 0.03%) or

high (heart failure group: 8%) salt rat diet (Oriental Yeast, 
Tokyo, Japan) and tap water ad libitum. Body weight and SBP 
were measured weekly. SBP was measured using the tail-cuff 
method (BP-98A: Softron, Tokyo, Japan). After 8 weeks of 
treatment, blood was collected from the inferior vena cava 
under pentobarbital anesthesia with ethylenediaminetetra￾acetic acid (EDTA) for RNA measurement and sodium citrate 
for BNP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as 
an anticoagulant. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 
1600×g for 15min at 4°C. Mononuclear cells were isolated by 
Histopaque-1083 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, U.S.A.) density gradi￾ent centrifugation. The cells were washed 3 times in phos￾phate-buffered saline (PBS). The heart, kidneys, and skeletal 
muscles (i.e., the quadriceps femoris) were resected and im￾mediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for transcriptome analysis 
or Western blot analysis.
The present study was conducted in accordance with the 
guidelines of the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Cen￾ter for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and the 
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals. Adequate measures were taken to mini￾mize the animals’ pain and discomfort.
Confirmation of miR-210 as One of the miRNAs Most 
Markedly Upregulated by Hypoxia ​H9c2 cells were ob￾tained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 
MD, U.S.A.) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s 
medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum 
(Gibco BRL, MD, U.S.A.). Cells were exposed to either nor￾moxic conditions (normoxia group: 20% O2, 5% CO2, with 
N2 balance at 37°C) or hypoxic conditions (hypoxia group: 
0–0.1% O2, 5% CO2, with N2 balance at 37°C) for 24h. The 
hypoxic culture condition was introduced by using a Cul￾turePal kit provided by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company 
(Tokyo, Japan). The treated H9c2 cells were washed with PBS 
and collected for transcriptome analysis or Western blot analy￾sis.
Rat Heart Failure Model and Cell Cultures. Transcrip￾tome Analyses ​Plasma RNA was isolated using the mirVana 
PARIS kit (Ambion, TX, U.S.A.) as described previously.14,19)
As an internal reference, a known amount of a synthetic ar￾tificial miRNA was included in plasma samples as described 
previously.12,14) Total RNA was extracted from H9c2 and 
mononuclear cells or tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 
CA, U.S.A.) as described previously.28)
The expression profiling of 375 miRNAs was performed 
using the ABI TaqMan Rodent MicroRNA Array kit (Card 
A: Applied Biosystems, CA, U.S.A.) according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions. U6 small nuclear RNA included in the 
TaqMan Rodent MicroRNA Array was used as an endogenous 
control. No cut-off point was used. The ABI Prism 7900 HT 
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) was used 
for amplification and detection. The CT value was obtained 
from the amplification plot using SDS software (Applied Bio￾systems).
The expressions of miR-210 and BNP mRNA were mea￾sured using the TaqMan microRNA real-time reverse tran￾scription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit29) (Applied 
Biosystems) and the TaqMan gene expression assay kit (Ap￾plied Biosystems) as described previously.14,19) The 7500 Fast 
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) was used for 
amplification and detection. The CT values were obtained from 
the amplification plot using SDS software.
ISCU Western Blot Analysis ​A rabbit polyclonal anti￾body against rat ISCU was obtained from Santa Cruz Bio￾technology (CA, U.S.A.). H9c2 cells or tissues of Dahl salt￾sensitive rats were homogenized in Triton-based lysis buffer, 
and the protein concentration was determined using the 
bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, IL, U.S.A.). Equal amounts 
of protein (5µg) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (12%) and 
transferred to a nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, Bucking￾hamshire, U.K.). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albu￾min (BSA), the membranes were incubated with the primary 
antibody (1: 1000 dilution) overnight at 4°C. Membrane-bound 
antibodies were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-con￾jugated secondary antibodies (1 :10000 dilution for 1h). The 
expression levels were quantified by densitometry (Lumines￾cent Image Analyzer LAS-1000: FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan).
Plasma BNP ELISA ​Plasma BNP concentrations were 
assayed using the AssayMax Rat BNP-45 ELISA Kit (As￾sayPro, MO, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Wallac 1420 
ARVO MX/Light system (PerkinElmer, MA, U.S.A.). Stan￾dard points and samples were determined in duplicate.
Assessment in Heart Failure Patients. Assessment of 
miR-210 Levels in Mononuclear Cells ​Mononuclear cells 
were isolated from 13 patients hospitalized for congestive 
heart failure (8 and 5 patients classified as New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) II, and NYHA III and IV, respectively, 
according to the NYHA functional classification system) and 
6 healthy control subjects. Plasma miR-210 concentrations 
were not determined because these samples were derived from 
samples of a previous study.19) Mononuclear cells were isolated 
by Ficoll-Paque Plus (Pharmacia, NJ, U.S.A.) density gradient 
centrifugation. The collected cells were washed 3 times with 
PBS. The total RNAs of mononuclear cells were extracted 
with TRIzol reagent and analyzed using real-time RT-PCR.
Assessment of Plasma miR-210 Levels ​Thirty-nine 
patients with heart failure were recruited from our outpa￾tient clinic. Blood samples were collected in tubes contain￾ing EDTA as an anticoagulant, plasma was obtained, and 
total RNA was purified as described above. Plasma BNP

concentrations were obtained from chart data. All patients 
were classified as having NYHA II heart failure caused by a 
previous myocardial infarction. In 24 out of 39 patients, plas￾ma BNP concentration was reassessed during the subsequent 
hospital visit approximately 3 months later. The patients were 
divided into “improved” and “unimproved” subgroups on the 
basis of the changes (i.e., decrease and increase, respectively) 
of their plasma BNP levels at the subsequent visit. Then, we 
evaluated whether plasma miR-210 levels at first visit could be 
used to predict the change in BNP.
Written informed consent was obtained from all partici￾pants. The present study was approved by the Ethics commit￾tee of the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center and 
performed in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World 
Medical Association.
Statistical Analysis ​Data are presented as mean±S.D. 
Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance 
(ANOVA), regression analysis, and contingency table analy￾sis using the JMP statistical analysis package (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC, U.S.A.).
Results
miRNA Array Analysis in Dahl Salt-Sensitive Rats with 
and without Heart Failure ​A high-salt diet for 8 weeks in￾duced markedly high blood pressure and heart failure in Dahl 
salt-sensitive rats as reported previously.14) SBP, the relative 
heart ratio, and BNP mRNA expression levels also increased 
with feeding of the high-salt diet (Table 1). These data demon￾strate that the high-salt diet induced heart failure.
The plasma RNAs of the control and heart failure groups 
were then subjected to miRNA array analysis (Table 2). Elev￾en miRNAs including miR-210 increased significantly in the 
heart failure group.
Confirmation of Hypoxia-Induced miRNAs in H9c2 
Cells ​Because heart failure is characterized by a deficiency 
in oxygen supply relative to peripheral oxygen demand, we 
hypothesized that miRNAs involved in hypoxia might be 
upregulated in heart failure. Therefore, H9c2 cells exposed 
to normoxic or hypoxic conditions were subjected to miRNA 
array analysis. The results showed that miR-210 expression 
levels increased markedly in cells under the hypoxic culture 
condition, which was validated by real-time RT-PCR (Figs. 
1A,B). ISCU is an important target of miR-210 and the 
induction of miR-210 downregulates its expression.24) Howev￾er, ISCU levels in H9c2 cells did not differ between normoxic 
and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1C).

array analysis in rats with heart failure and confirmation of 
miR-210 upregulation in cells cultured under hypoxic condi￾tions, we investigated whether miR-210 is a biomarker for 
heart failure. Thus, we examined miR-210 expression levels 
in rats fed the low- (Control: n=9) and high-salt diets (Heart 
failure: n=13). Expression levels of miR-210 increased up to 
15.0 fold in plasma (Fig. 2A). The miR-210 expression levels 
of mononuclear cells, the heart, the kidneys, and skeletal 
muscle were examined in order to clarify the tissues in which 
miR-210 levels increased. Although miR-210 expression levels 
were unchanged in the heart and kidneys (Figs. 2C, D), they 
increased up to 4.5 and 2.1 fold in mononuclear cells and skel￾etal muscle, respectively (Figs. 2B,E). However, ISCU expres￾sion was not downregulated in Dahl salt-sensitive rats with 
heart failure (Fig. 2F).
Then, rats with and without heart failure were prepared 
Fig. 2. Expression of miR-210, BNP and ISCU in Rats with Heart Failure
The expression levels of miR-210 in the rats fed the low- and high-salt diets were examined by real-time RT-PCR (n=9 and n=13, respectively). The columns with bars 
represent the mean±S.D. Control: control group, Heart failure: heart failure group. N.S., not significant. The expression levels of miR-210 were quantified in (A) plasma, 
(B) mononuclear cells, (C) the heart, (D) the kidneys, and (E) skeletal muscle. The expression levels of miR-210 increased 15.0 fold in plasma (p<0.05). The expression 
levels of miR-210 did not change in the heart and kidneys. In contrast, the expression levels of miR-210 increased 4.5 and 2.1 fold in mononuclear cells (p<0.03) and skel￾etal muscle (p<0.01), respectively. (F) ISCU was measured in skeletal muscle by Western blotting. ISCU levels did not change in the heart failure group. (G) Plasma BNP 
concentrations of rats with heart failure (n=5, 228.1±147.8pg/mL) were significantly higher than those of without heart failure (n=5, 18.8±5.3 pg/mL, p<0.03). Moreover 
plasma miR-210 levels were strongly correlated with plasma BNP concentration.

(n=5 and n=5, respectively) in order to assess the correla￾tion between plasma BNP and miR-210 levels. The plasma 
BNP concentrations of rats with heart failure (228.1±147.8pg/
mL) were significantly higher than those without heart failure 
(18.8±5.3 pg/mL, p<0.03). Moreover, plasma miR-210 levels 
were strongly correlated (r
2
=0.7531) with plasma BNP, a con￾ventional marker of heart failure (Fig. 2G).
Assessment of Plasma miR-210 Levels in Patients with 
Heart Failure ​We hypothesized that miR-210 is upregu￾lated in patients with severe heart failure. Indeed, the miR-210 
expression levels in mononuclear cells were significantly 
higher in patients with NYHA III and IV heart failure than 
those with NYHA II or healthy controls (Fig. 3A, p<0.05). 
However, the miR-210 expression levels in mononuclear cells 
were not significantly different between healthy controls and 
patients with NYHA II heart failure.
Accordingly, 39 patients with NYHA II heart failure were 
recruited from our outpatient clinic. Their characteristics are 
summarized in Table 3. The correlation between plasma BNP 
and miR-210 levels was examined; no significant correlation 
was observed in these patients (Fig. 3B). However, plasma 
BNP concentrations were reassessed at the subsequent hospi￾tal visit approximately 3 months later; consequently, plasma 
miR-210 levels of all the improved patients were in the lower 
range (0.42±0.10, n=6) than those of not improved patients 
(0.65±0.25, n=18, p<0.05). As a result, no patients with high￾er plasma miR-210 level had a tendency to improve (Fig. 3C).
Discussion
Based on the result of increased miR-210 by hypoxia in the 
in vitro experiment, we showed that plasma miR-210 may be 
available to know the condition of heart failure. Additionally, 
we found that the information obtained from the measurement 
of plasma miR-210 levels is different from plasma BNP con￾centration.
miRNA array analysis of the plasma of Dahl salt-sensitive 
rats with heart failure revealed various candidate biomarker 
miRNAs, including miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-20a, miR-103, 
miR-130a, miR-130b, miR-195, miR-210, miR-301b, miR-451, 
and miR-494 (Table 2). The miR-15 family (i.e., miR-15a, miR￾15b, and miR-195) has been reported to regulate the postnatal 
mitotic arrest of cardiomyocytes.30) Meanwhile, the miR-130 
family (i.e., miR-130a and miR-130b) has been reported to 
enhance HIF-1α translation,31) while miR-494 has been re￾ported to activate the Akt pathway, which confers protective 
effects against ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac injury.32)
MiR-20a has been reported to modulate the translation of E2F 
transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation and apo￾ptosis.33) However, the physiological functions of miR-103 and 
miR-301b are still incompletely understood. Therefore, these 
may be worth investigating in further detail in future studies.
The miRNA array data of the rats were compared with 
those of the human sample obtained from a previous study.19)
The results show that rats and humans with severe heart fail￾ure exhibited upregulated plasma miR-210 and miR-451 levels. 
MiR-451 is highly expressed in erythroid cells34); hemolysis, 
which is frequently observed in congestive heart failure, ap￾pears to be the reason for the upregulation of plasma miR-451 
in heart failure. Therefore, we focused on miR-210 as a pos￾sible biomarker for congestive heart failure.

miR-210 is well known to be upregulated by hypoxia.35,36)
It is also reported that miR-210 is regulated via both HIF￾dependent37,38) and HIF-independent mechanisms,39) and that 
miR-210 is associated with angiogenesis.40) Indeed, the present 
results confirm the induction of miR-210 by hypoxia. Chronic 
heart failure is characterized by a deficiency in oxygen supply 
relative to the demand of the peripheral tissues. Thus, from 
this perspective, miR-210 might be the promising candidate 
biomarker for heart failure.
The plasma miR-210 levels were increased in Dahl salt-sen￾sitive rats with heart failure induced by 8 weeks of high-salt 
diet feeding. miR-210 expression levels of mononuclear cells, 
the heart, the kidneys, and skeletal muscle were examined in 
order to elucidate the tissues in which miR-210 was elevated. 
The expression levels of miR-210 did not change in the heart 
or kidneys. This is probably because the heart and kidneys 
were not exposed to hypoxic conditions, because the blood 
flow to these organs might be preferentially preserved.
In contrast, miR-210 expression levels in mononuclear 
cells and skeletal muscles increased significantly. The skel￾etal muscles may be the first target of reduced blood supply 
in congestive heart failure.41) The increased plasma miR-210 
levels might be attributable to increased miR-210 levels in the 
skeletal muscle.
Moreover, we assessed the correlation between plasma BNP 
and miR-210 levels. The results show that plasma miR-210 lev￾els were strongly correlated with plasma BNP, a conventional 
marker of heart failure. Therefore, the results suggest that 
plasma miR-210 levels are a prognostic biomarker for chronic 
heart failure.
Next, we assessed miR-210 expression in human patients 
with heart failure. The expression levels of miR-210 in the 
mononuclear cells of patients with NYHA III and IV heart 
failure were significantly higher than those with NYHA II 
heart failure and healthy controls. However, miR-210 expres￾sion levels in mononuclear cells did not differ between healthy 
controls and patients with NYHA II heart failure. Further￾more, no significant correlation was observed between BNP 
and miR-210 plasma levels in patients with NYHA II heart 
failure. Thus, it is conceivable that the results of the present 
animal experiment are close to those observed in severe heart 
failure (NYHA III and IV) patients before medical treatment. 
Furthermore, the results suggest that the lower correlation 
in human samples could be attributed to medical treatments. 
However, none of the patients with higher plasma miR-210 
levels showed a tendency toward improved BNP levels. There￾fore, plasma miR-210 level is an auxiliary prognostic biomark￾er for chronic heart failure.
In the aging population, deaths and medical costs attribut￾able to heart failure are increasing rapidly. Managing patients 
with heart failure is one of the greatest challenges our aging 
society faces. Therefore, the development of accurate prognos￾tic biomarkers of heart failure is important. Plasma BNP level 
is an excellent biomarker for assessing patients with heart 
failure. Plasma BNP levels mainly reflect the degree of ven￾tricular overload,42) and are, therefore, an excellent prognostic 
biomarker for heart failure.43) Because miR-210 is significantly 
induced by hypoxia, miR-210 levels may reflect a mismatch 
between the pump function of the heart and oxygen demand 
in the peripheral tissues. In this sense, plasma miR-210 is a 
potential prognostic biomarker for heart failure in addition 
to plasma BNP level. However, since the number of samples 
in the present study was insufficient to determine a suitable 
plasma miR-210 cut-off point and the assessment of severe 
patients was not carried out, a larger clinical study is required 
to confirm this hypothesis. In addition, although mononuclear 
cells might be suitable for diagnosis, this would be impractical 
because isolating these cells is inconvenient.
The biological significance of miR-210 induction by hypoxia 
remains unclear. It has been reported that ISCU is one of the 
direct targets of miR-210 and is downregulated by hypoxia￾induced miR-210 in cancer cell lines.38) However, miR-210 
induction did not suppress ISCU protein levels under hypoxic 
conditions in our experiments using rat myocardial cells. 
Moreover, miR-210–knockout mice are reported to exhibit no 
gross phenotype.44) Therefore, further studies are required to 
fully clarify the biological functions of miR-210.
