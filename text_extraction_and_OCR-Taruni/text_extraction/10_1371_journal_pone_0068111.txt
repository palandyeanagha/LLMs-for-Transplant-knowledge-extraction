Abstract
Background and Aim: The genotype-phenotype interaction in drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a subject of growing
interest. Previous studies have linked amoxicillin-clavulanate (AC) hepatotoxicity susceptibility to specific HLA alleles. In this
study we aimed to examine potential associations between HLA class I and II alleles and AC DILI with regards to phenotypic
characteristics, severity and time to onset in Spanish AC hepatotoxicity cases.
Methods: High resolution genotyping of HLA loci A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 was performed in 75 AC DILI cases and 885
controls.
Results: The distributions of class I alleles A*3002 (P/Pc = 2.6E-6/5E-5, OR 6.7) and B*1801 (P/Pc = 0.008/0.22, OR 2.9) were
more frequently found in hepatocellular injury cases compared to controls. In addition, the presence of the class II allele
combination DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 (P/Pc = 5.1E-4/0.014, OR 3.0) was significantly increased in cholestatic/mixed cases. The
A*3002 and/or B*1801 carriers were found to be younger (54 vs 65 years, P = 0.019) and were more frequently hospitalized
than the DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 carriers. No additional alleles outside those associated with liver injury patterns were found
to affect potential severity as measured by Hy’s Law criteria. The phenotype frequencies of B*1801 (P/Pc = 0.015/0.42, OR
5.2) and DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 (P/Pc = 0.0026/0.07, OR 15) were increased in AC DILI cases with delayed onset compared to
those corresponding to patients without delayed onset, while the opposite applied to DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 (P/Pc = 0.005/
0.13, OR 0.07).
Conclusions: HLA class I and II alleles influence the AC DILI signature with regards to phenotypic expression, latency
presentation and severity in Spanish patients.

Introduction
Amoxicillin-clavulanate (AC) was marketed over 30 years ago
and is today one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in
Spain and Europe [1,2]. Its widespread use stems from the
effective combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, which
extends the antimicrobial spectrum by providing activity against
beta-lactamase producing bacteria. Despite being a relatively safe
medication, AC has been associated with idiosyncratic drug￾induced liver injury (DILI). It is currently the main causative drug
in two large DILI registries as well as being associated with the
highest hospitalization rate among DILI cases in the Spanish DILI
registry [3,4].
In spite of increasing attention on the impact and pathology of
DILI during the last decade, the underlying mechanism of AC
hepatotoxicity remains undefined. The clavulanic acid constituent
is, however, believed to increase the DILI risk as considerably less
hepatotoxicity cases due to amoxicillin alone have been reported
[5]. The involvement of immune related components in AC DILI
was first suggested in two independent studies conducted in the
UK and Belgium. Both studies demonstrated enhanced frequency
of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles DRB1*1501
and DQB1*0602 in AC DILI cases [6,7]. The result was later
confirmed in a recent collaborative genome-wide association
(GWA) study involving 201 AC DILI cases from the UK, US and
Spain [8]. This study also demonstrated variations in HLA allele

associations between the Spanish and the British/American cases,
suggesting the presence of ethnically different risk alleles in AC￾DILI. Such differential allele associations may lead to clinical
phenotype discrepancies. For example, AC hepatotoxicity gener￾ally manifests as cholestatic or mixed damage, though a
comparison of clinical profiles in AC DILI cases of different
ethnic origin has demonstrated differences in phenotypic expres￾sion, with Spanish cases exhibiting a higher prevalence of
developing hepatocellular type of injury [9].
The time frame between starting an AC treatment and the onset
of hepatotoxicity can also vary. It is not uncommon to find
symptoms of AC DILI commencing after the treatment is
completed. In fact, delayed (after treatment cessation) onset is
often considered a characteristic feature of AC DILI [9]. The
determinant behind a drug’s hepatotoxicity ‘signature’, (consistent
clinical and pathological features, latency presentation and
severity) is currently unknown, but could to some extent be
genetically controlled.
This study was undertaken to further explore differential HLA
associations in AC DILI cases recently encountered in a
multinational study. Here we have focused on an extended
Spanish AC DILI cohort in an attempt to define associations
between HLA class I and II alleles and the AC DILI signature with
regards to phenotypic characteristics, onset and severity.
Patients and Methods
Subjects and Study Protocol
Cases of AC-induced liver injury were selected from those
submitted to the Spanish DILI Registry, a collaborative network
established in 1994 to prospectively identify DILI cases in a
standardized manner. Forty-nine of the cases were included in a
recent international study [8] while the remaining 26 cases have
not previously been analysed for HLA associations. The criteria
for DILI were: an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) $3
times the upper limit of normal (xULN) or $2 xULN of alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) or total bilirubin (TB) $2 xULN if associated
with elevations of ALT or ALP. The pattern of liver injury was
classified based on R value calculations ((ALT value/ULN)/(ALP
value/ULN)) as described earlier [10]. An R value of $5, 2,R.5
and #2 indicates hepatocellular, mixed and cholestatic liver
injury, respectively. Liver tests used for the classification of liver
damage were the first blood test available after liver injury
detection. As a marker of severe DILI, cases were assessed for
fulfilling Hy’s Law. Criteria used to define Hy’s Law cases were:
hepatocellular injury (R $5) with total bilirubin .2 xULN in the
absence of other explanations for the combined increase in
bilirubin and transaminase values [11]. All submitted cases were
evaluated for causality assessment initially by a group of three
experts and later through the application of the Council for
International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) scale
[12]. A detailed description of the operational structure of the
registry, data recording and case ascertainment has been reported
elsewhere [13].
As a control group for the HLA allele analyses, we selected 885
unrelated bone marrow donors of Caucasian descent, with no
previously known history of DILI, from the Immunology Unit at
the Hospital Virgen de las Nieves in Granada, Spain. Due to the
frequent use of AC in the general population in Spain it was
assumed that a large proportion of the controls would have taken
AC during some stage of their lives [1].
Ethics Statement
The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee
of the coordinating center at the Hospital Universitario Virgen de
la Victoria in Ma´laga, Spain. All subjects who took part in the
study gave written informed consent, which conformed to the
current Helsinki Declaration.
DNA Extraction and Determination of HLA Class I and II
Genotypes
Venous blood was obtained from each subject and DNA was
extracted using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Genotyping of the HLA class I (A, B and C) and II (DRB1 and
DQB1) loci was performed using the LABTypeH SSO typing test
(One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, USA). Target DNA was
amplified by PCR using sequence-specific primers, followed by
hybridization with allele-specific oligodeoxynucleotides coupled
with fluorescent phycoerythrin-labeled microspheres. The fluores￾cence intensity was determined with a Bio-Plex 200 system
(Luminex xMAP, Austin, TX, USA). HLA alleles were assigned
using the HLA-Tools software (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA,
USA).
Statistical Analysis
HLA allele distributions were compared between DILI patients
and controls using a comparison of proportions test, a derivative of
the Chi-square test. Means were compared by Student t test for
independent samples. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for
comparison of groups. Where variables did not follow a normal
distribution, a nonparametric analysis with the Kruskal-Wallis test
was performed. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated to assess the relative disease risk conferred by
a specific allele. Analyses were performed using the SPSS 19.0
statistical software package program (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA)
and P,0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
To account for the problem of significant associations arising by
chance after multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction for
multiple tests was applied by multiplying the probability value (P)
by the total number of alleles compared for each locus (n = 19, 27,
19, 27 and 14 for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and –DQB1,
respectively) to give a corrected P value (Pc). To correct for
HLA class II allele combinations the P value was multiplied by the
number of DRB1 alleles encountered in this study (n = 27). HLA
class I allele combinations were corrected for by multiplying with
the total number of alleles in the most diverse locus, ie HLA-B
(n = 27).
Amino Acid Analysis
Evaluation of the HLA alleles (loci A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1)
at the amino acid level, in particular amino acids situated in the
antigen binding pockets, and their associations and interactions
were conducted using the SKDM software program [14].
Results
Description of DILI Patients
Seventy five AC-induced liver injury patients, 46 male/29
female (mean age, 58 years) were analysed. The type of liver
damage was classified as hepatocellular (n = 28), cholestatic
(n = 22) or mixed (n = 25) with jaundice detected in 88% of the
patients. Nineteen patients (25%) fulfilled Hy’s Law criteria. There
was a favourable clinical outcome in 73 patients, while two
patients developed fulminant hepatic failure.

HLA Class I and II Genotyping
High resolution genotyping of the HLA class I (A, B and C) and
II (DRB1 and DQB1) loci was performed in 75 DILI cases,
classified by the type of liver damage (hepatocellular or
cholestatic/mixed), and 885 controls. The class I alleles A*3002
(OR = 6.7; CI = 2.8–15.9, P/Pc = 2.6E-6/5E-5) and B*1801
(OR = 2.9; CI = 1.3–6.2, P/Pc = 0.0082/0.22) were significantly
more common in hepatocellular cases than in the controls, though
the latter did not reach significance after Bonferroni’s correction.
The association with hepatocellular injury was also extended to the
A*3002-B*1801 allele combination (OR = 5.3; CI = 1.9–14.7, P/
Pc = 9.5E-4/0.026). In contrast, the class II allele combination
DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 (OR = 3.0; CI = 1.6–5.5; P/Pc = 5.1E￾4/0.014) was significantly more common in DILI cases with
cholestatic/mixed type of damage compared to the controls
(Table 1).
HLA Allele Associations with AC DILI Phenotypes
Clinical data was compared between cases containing the alleles
A*3002 and/or B*1801 (referred to as group 1) and those without
these two alleles but containing the DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602
allele combination (group 2). The patients in group 1 were
significantly younger (54 vs 65 years (P = 0.019), 46% vs 83%
being $60 years of age (P = 0.013)). The distribution of males and
females also varied between the two groups with a preponderance
of males in group 1 (71% vs 29%) and females in group 2 (61% vs
39%) (P = 0.038). In terms of liver damage, group 1 had a
predominance of hepatocellular type of injury, while cholestatic/
mixed type of injury was significantly more common among the
patients in group 2. The predominance of hepatocellular injury in
group 1 was also reflected in the significantly higher ALT mean
value for the same group (P = 0.007). The two fulminant liver
failure cases fell into group 1, which also had a higher proportion
of hospitalizations (71% vs 44%) (Table 2).
HLA Allele Associations with Hy’s Law Cases
In search for HLA alleles associated with severe hepatotoxicity,
all cases complying with Hy’s Law criteria (hepatocellular cases (R
$5) with total bilirubin values .2 xULN) were selected and
analysed. To determine the best definition of Hy’s Law criteria we
examined the proportion of hepatocellular and cholestatic/mixed
cases that were included when considering ‘hepatocellular injury’
to indicate .3, $5 and $10 xULN of ALT or R $5, in
conjunction with a total bilirubin value of .2 xULN. With an
ALT value .3 xULN, 47 cases qualified of which 60% were
cholestatic or mixed cases. The corresponding numbers for ALT
$5 and $10 xULN were 37 cases (49% chol/mix) and 19 cases
(26% chol/mix), respectively. When considering an R value $5
and total bilirubin .2 xULN 19 hepatocellular cases qualified, of
which only three had 2,ALP,4 xULN. Hence, these 19 cases
were selected as Hy’s Law cases.
The HLA-A*3002 allele was found to be significantly more
frequent in the Hy’s Law cases compared to the controls
(OR = 6.0; CI = 2.1–17.2, P/Pc = 4.9E-4/0.0093). A similar trend
was noted for the B*1801 allele, though it did not reach
significance (OR = 2.6; CI = 1.0–6.7, P/Pc = 0.059/1). When
comparing hepatocellular cases with total bilirubin .2 xULN
with those having ,2 xULN, the principal difference noted was
the allele combination DRB1*1502-DQB1*0602 being substan￾tially less common in the former group (OR = 0.07; CI = 0.006–
0.8, P/Pc = 0.024/0.64) (Table 3).
HLA Allele Associations with AC Hepatotoxicity Onset
To examine if specific HLA alleles potentially affect the time for
liver injury onset to occur the cohort was classified into those
developing DILI while on the treatment, 32 cases, and those that
developed DILI after the treatment was withdrawn (delayed
onset), 43 cases. The B*1801 allele was more frequently found in
cases with delayed onset compared to those without (OR = 5.2;
CI = 1.4–19.9, P/Pc = 0.015/0.42). In addition, the presence of
A*3002 (OR = 3.8; CI = 1.7–8.7, P/Pc = 0.0011/0.021) in cases
with delayed onset was significantly higher compared to those of
the 885 controls. The class II allele combinations DRB1*0301-
DQB1*0201 (OR = 15.0; CI = 1.8–121.1, P/Pc = 0.0026/0.07)
and DRB1*1302-DQB*0604 (OR = 0.07; CI = 0.008–0.6,
P = 0.005/0.13) were found more frequently in cases with and
without delayed onset, respectively. The occurrence of
DRB1*1302-DQB*0604 in cases with no delayed onset was also
significantly higher when compared to controls (OR = 4.7;
CI = 2.0–10.8, P/Pc = 1.8E-4/0.0049) (Table 4a). No statistically
significant differences in type of liver injury distribution were seen
between cases with (Hep: 40%, Chol: 37%, Mix: 23%) and
without (Hep: 34%, Chol: 19%, Mix: 47%) delayed onset.
Nevertheless, 61%, 73% and 40% of all hepatocellular, cholestatic
and mixed cases, respectively, were seen to have delayed onset.
No significant differences in allele distribution were detected
when comparing cases with 15 days or more with those having less
than 15 days delayed onset. However, there was a tendency for a
longer delayed onset in the presence of DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602
(Table 4b). No significant differences in the type of damage were
seen between cases with more than 15 days delayed onset and
those with shorter delayed onset.
Amino Acid Analysis of HLA Alleles
The HLA alleles identified in DILI patients and controls were
also analysed at amino acid level, with specific focus on the amino
acids situated in the antigen binding pockets. An aspartic acid and
a glycine situated at amino acids 166 and 167, respectively, in the
HLA-A locus were found to reduce the risk of hepatocellular type
of DILI (OR = 0.19; P/Pc = 7.01E-4/0.034), but did not have any
effect on the risk of developing cholestatic/mixed type of DILI.
The only amino acid found to produce a significantly enhanced

risk of DILI was an arginine at residue 152 in the HLA-A locus
(OR = 5.87; P/Pc = 4.75E-4/0.023) and the risk was limited to
hepatocellular type of injury. No specific amino acids in the HLA
loci B, C, DRB1 or DQB1 were found to provide any significant
DILI risk or protection.
Discussion
Variations in HLA allele associations in AC DILI cases have
recently been demonstrated between ethnically different cohorts
[8]. We hypothesised that such differences may influence
phenotype presentations. In this study we found that the HLA
class I alleles A*3002 and B*1801 were associated with hepato￾cellular injury, while the class II allele combination DRB1*1501-
DQB1*0602 (known to be in strong linkage disequilibrium and
subsequently form a common HLA class II haplotype) was
associated with cholestatic/mixed type of liver damage. Although
DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 has previously been implicated in AC
DILI, phenotype specific associations may have been overlooked
in earlier studies due to smaller cohorts with a predominance of
cholestatic cases [6,7]. In contrast, 37% of the cases in our cohort
presented hepatocellular damage and subsequently enabled a
stratified phenotype analysis. An association between B*1801 and
Spanish AC DILI patients was recently demonstrated with a clear
tendency towards hepatocellular injury [8]. In addition, statistical
significance was demonstrated between the presence of B*1801
and highly elevated ALT values, being suggestive of hepatocellular
injury, in the same population. Similar results were seen in this
study with B*1801 being significantly associated with increased
ALT values but not reaching significance after Bonferroni’s

correction in terms of hepatocellular type of injury despite the
increase in cohort size. Hence, B*1801 is not likely to be the only
risk factor for hepatocellular injury, but more likely one of several
genetic factors distinguishing type of liver injury in AC hepato￾toxicity. The fact that the type of liver injury is preserved in
patients with multiple DILI episodes induced by different drugs
and subsequently under different environmental conditions
supports the idea of genetic determinants in the host controlling
the injury type [15]. The ethnic restriction for the HLA-B*1801
effect as demonstrated to date highlights the importance of using
ethnically correct control populations in DILI pharmacogenetic
studies.
The A*3002 allele is relatively infrequent in Caucasians
(phenotype distribution in our control group = 5.6%). Intriguingly,
14.7% of the DILI cases contained this allele and 72.7% of these
patients manifested hepatocellular damage. In fact, the presence of
A*3002 was associated with a higher risk of developing
hepatocellular injury (OR = 6.7) than that of B*1801 (OR = 2.9).
The risk of hepatocellular DILI remained for the A*3002-B*1801
allele combination. Both of these alleles are present in the
conserved extended haplotype (CEH) HLA-A*3002-B*1801-
Cw*0501-DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201, which is more frequent in
southern parts of Europe. In fact, it has been shown to be the third
most common CEH in Spain [16]. The elevated occurrence of
A*3002 and B*1801 in Spain was evident when comparing allele
frequencies in control populations from various geographic
locations and may be a reason for the ethnically restricted
phenotypic effects of these genes to date in AC DILI (Table S1).
Associations between DRB1*15, DQB1*06 and cholestatic/
mixed type of injury was also detected in our earlier HLA
genotyping study of 140 DILI patients with various causal agents
(of which 17% were due to AC) [17]. One might speculate that
DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 is therefore associated with cholestatic/
mixed type of damage in general and not limited to AC DILI
specifically. This is supported by the reported link between
DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 and primary sclerosing cholangitis [18].
Nevertheless, liver enzyme elevations caused by lumiracoxib has
recently been associated with the presence of the extended
haplotype HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602-DRB5*0101-
DQA1*0102 in a cohort of predominantly hepatocellular injury
cases [19], which speaks in favour of DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602
having a different effect on the clinical expression in lumiracoxib
DILI.
Patients over 60 years of age have previously been shown to
have a higher tendency to develop cholestatic type of injury, while
those younger than 60 years are more prone to suffer hepatocel￾lular damage [3]. With this in mind the demographical findings
when comparing the A*3002 and/or B*1801 carriers with those
carrying the DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 alleles also provide indirect
indications of different liver injury type associations, as the cases in
the class I allele group were significantly younger than those
carrying the specified class II alleles. This was seen in both the
mean age as well as in the proportion of patients over 60 years of
age. Men were seen to predominate among the A*3002/B*1801
carriers of younger age, despite earlier findings of younger women
being more prone to develop hepatocellular type of DILI [3]. A
trend towards younger men being more prone to develop
hepatocellular AC DILI has however been detected earlier,
suggesting a more prominent role for age compared to sex. In
fact, age has been shown to be the most important non-genetic
determinant in the biochemical expression of AC DILI [9].
Carriers of A*3002 or B*1801 alleles were also seen to require
hospitalizations more frequently than those carrying the
DRB1*1501-DQB1-0602 alleles, suggesting that the presence of
the two class I alleles potentially lead to a more serious nature of
injury. In fact, the only two cases of the cohort that developed
fulminant hepatic failure were both B*1801 carriers, with one of
the patients also containing A*3002 allele.
Hyman Zimmerman observed that DILI cases with hepatocel￾lular injury in conjunction with jaundice have at least a 10%
mortality rate, now termed Hy’s Law [11]. However, the best
definition of Hy’s Law cases remains a matter of debate. We found
that using an R value $5 avoided the inclusion of cases with an
important cholestatic component, which applied when using
increased ALT values as inclusion criteria. The 19 cases with R
$5 and total bilirubin .2 xULN were enriched in A*3002 and
B*1801 compared to the controls. Nevertheless, the phenotypic
distribution of these alleles did not differ between hepatocellular
cases classified by accompanying total bilirubin value. Therefore,
A*3002 and B*1801 per se do not seem to notably increase the risk
of mortality. However, these alleles are associated with hepato￾cellular injury, which is the type of injury that most frequently lead

to acute liver failure [13,20]. Interestingly, the Hy’s Law cases
contained a reduced proportion of DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602
carriers. This is in accordance with these alleles being associated
with cholestatic/mixed type of injury, which generally has a lower
mortality risk. However, the relatively small size of the cohort
precluded us from establishing whether these phenotype-genotype
associations could be used as predictive biomarkers for severity.
The use of cases fulfilling the Hy’s Law criteria to represent
severity is not ideal as only approximately 10% of these cases are
expected to have a grave outcome [13,21]. The use of more
clinically relevant end points, such as development of liver failure
or death would provide more accurate data. However, our cohort
only contained two patients in this category, which in fact
corresponds to 10.5% of the Hy’s Law cases. It is clearly a
limitation to our study that such a low number of ‘truly severe
cases’ does not enable any reliable statistical analysis. Hence,
further analyses using bigger cohorts of severe AC DILI cases are
required to confirm these results.
A time lapse between drug cessation and DILI presentation is a
common feature in AC DILI [9]. Fifty-seven percent of our cohort
was seen to have delayed onset. This subgroup of patients was
enriched in the HLA class I alleles A*3002 and B*1801 as well as
the DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 alleles. Surprisingly though, the
proportion of hepatocellular cases was not significantly increased
in this subgroup, but very similar to that of cholestatic cases.
Nevertheless, the majority (61%) of all hepatocellular cases had
delayed onset, which may explain the high frequency of A*3002
and B*1801. The high frequency of DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201
possibly stems from its inclusion in the same CEH as A*3002 and
B*1801. Genetic variations associated with this CEH or parts
thereof could play a role in determining time to onset. Transfer of
non-HLA disease traits on CEH has been reported, such as
susceptibility for immunoglobulin D deficiency on the aforemen￾tioned CEH, presumably located between the HLA class II and III
regions [22].
Patients without delay onset were more likely to contain the
DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 allele combination. The distribution of
DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 carriers is noticeable with 89% showing
no delayed onset. We are currently unable to explain the
significance of this finding. One might speculate that
DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 is associated with a particularly strong
immune response and subsequently mounts a faster T cell
response. This has been demonstrated for HLA-DRB1*13 in
other situations [23,24]. Nonetheless, the possibility of non-HLA
genes, linked to individual HLA alleles or haplotypes, being the
true determinant of temporal disease initiation should not be
overlooked.
The amino acids constituting the HLA molecules, especially
those forming antigen binding pockets, could influence immuno￾logic responses. We found that the presence of an arginine in
position 152 of the HLA-A locus was significantly more common
in the hepatocellular cases than the controls. Amino acid 152 in
the HLA loci A, B and C are part of antigen binding pocket E. It is
also involved in T cell receptor binding, though this function
seems to be limited to the HLA-A locus. An arginine at residue
152 is present in A*3002. Though it is not specific for A*3002, its
presence is mostly limited to A*30 and A*80 alleles. Arginine is
also the only positively charged amino acid found at position 152
in the HLA-A alleles identified to date [25]. Hence, a positively
charged residue at this position at the HLA-A locus is therefore not
a requirement for AC DILI, but may enhance the risk. It is
possible that an evaluation of individual amino acids focusing
merely on presence or absence, while not considering information
that places the residues into structural and functional context, may
fail to notice essential associations and therefore does not provide a
full answer.
It is interesting to note that the presence of an arginine at
residue 62 in the HLA-B*1502 allele has recently demonstrated a
role in carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity producing Ste￾vens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. The arginine
side chain is believed to form a hydrogen bond with the ketone
group of 5-carboxamide of carbamazepine in the HLA-B*1502 B
pocket, while an asparagine at residue 63 contributes to the
specificity in molecular recognition [26]. The protective effect of
aspartic acid and glycine at residues 166 and 167, respectively, in
the HLA-A locus corresponds with the low number of hepatocel￾lular DILI cases in our cohort seen to contain alleles with these
specific residues: A*0101, A*2301, A*2402 and A*8001.
Though no mechanistic explanations for the detected pheno￾type-genotype associations can currently be offered, one can
speculate that the underlying mechanism of AC DILI toxicity
could involve protein-drug/metabolite complex presentation by
HLA class I and II molecules and subsequent T-cell mediated
cytotoxicity and cytokine production. The expression of HLA class
I molecules on hepatocytes could contribute to hepatocellular
injury, while HLA class II antigens have been found to be
expressed on biliary epithelium, which may potentially evoke
cholestatic type of injury. The role of natural killer cells, abundant
in the liver and whose level of cytotoxic responsiveness is greatly
influenced by HLA class I binding, in DILI warrants further
studies [27].
In conclusion, our data are consistent with a role for
immunological factors affecting the AC DILI signature in Spanish
patients, with the HLA-A*3002 and B*1801 alleles being
associated with hepatocellular pattern of injury, while HLA￾DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 increases the risk of cholestatic/mixed
type of liver damage. The former correlation was reinforced in
Hy’s Law cases and the two HLA class I alleles were also more
prominent in cases with delayed onset. In contrast, DRB1*1302-
DQB1*0604 carriers were scarcely seen to have delayed onset.
The findings highlight a role for genetics, not only in AC DILI
susceptibility, but also in phenotype expression.
