Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
is often associated with substantial weight loss and
reduced skeletal mass and function [1-3]. The
prevalence becoming underweight is 35-60% of pa￾tients with moderate-to-severe COPD whereas mus￾cle wasting occurs in 20% of stable COPD [1, 4-5]. 
Weight loss and muscle wasting contribute to a
reduction in physical performance and can lead to
disability [6]. In advanced COPD, the loss of body
weight and the deterioration of muscle mass/func￾tion represent independent predictors of morbidity
and mortality [7-9]. Furthermore, cachexia, the ex￾treme form of ‘underweight’ (usually defined by a
lean body mass index (LBMI) <16 Kg/m2 in males
and <15 Kg/m2 in females) [10], reduces the sur￾vival rate by half after adjustments for spirometric
severity of COPD [10].
Consequently, therapeutic strategies aimed at
reversing this particular outcome are of great in￾terest in terms of both patient’s prognosis and
quality of life. To date, this topic has been adopted
by nutritional interventions; pharmacotherapies,
and physical training, even though all these op￾tions are still proving to have significant limits.
Studies carried out on adding nutritional sup￾plementation to an eight-week integrated pul￾monary rehabilitation showed a significant im￾provement of body weight (BW) associated with a
longer survival [11]; an increased fat free mass
(FFM); maximal inspiratory pressure; handgrip
strength, exercise capacity [12] in a proportion of
patients investigated. Conversely, a larger popula￾tion of patients do not show any benefit from an
intensive, integrated, long-term rehabilitation.

ABSTRACT: Comprehensive effects of supplemented
essential amino acids in patients with severe COPD and
sarcopenia. R.W. Dal Negro, R. Aquilani, S. Bertacco, 
F. Boschi, C. Micheletto, S. Tognella.
Aim. Aim of the study was to investigate whether or
not oral supplementation of essential amino acids (EAAs)
may improve body composition, muscle metabolism, phys￾ical activity, cognitive function, and health status in a pop￾ulation of subjects with severe chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease (COPD) and sarcopenia. 
Methods. Thirty-two patients (25 males) (FEV1/FVC
<40% predicted), age 75±7 years, were randomised (n=16
in both groups) to receive 4 gr/bid EAAs or placebo ac￾cording to a double-blind design. When entered the study
(T0), after four (T4), and after twelve (T12) weeks of treat￾ments, body weight, fat free-mass (FFM), plasma lactate
concentration (µmol/l), arterial PaCO2 and PaO2, physical
activity (n° steps/day), cognitive function (Mini Mental
State Examination; MMSE), health status (St.George’s
Respiratory Questionnaire; SGRQ) were measured. 
Results. EAAs supplemented, but not patients assuming
placebo, progressively improved all baseline variables over￾time. In particular, at T12 of EAAs supplementation, body
weight (BW) increased by 6 Kg (p=0.002), FFM by 3.6 Kg
(p=0.05), plasma lactate decreased from 1.6 µmol/l to 1.3 µmol/l
(p=0.023), PaO2 increased by 4.6 mmHg (p=0.01), physical ac￾tivity increased by 80% (p=0.01). Moreover, the score for cog￾nitive dysfunction improved from 19.1 scores to 20.8 (p=0.011),
while the SRGQ score also improved from 72.3 to 69.6 even
though this trend did not reach the statistical significance. 
Conclusions. A three-month EAAs supplementation
may have comprehensive effects on nutritional status; mus￾cle energy metabolism; blood oxygen tension, physical au￾tonomy; cognitive function, and perception of health status
in patients with severe COPD and secondary sarcopenia.

flammatory drugs [13]; growth hormone [14]; an￾abolic steroids [15-17]) showed no or negligible
benefits on lean body mass, and no significant im￾provement in lung function.
Whole body physical training, a further sup￾port to COPD treatment, was found to induce an
anabolic response and an increase of BW by in￾creasing FFM [18]; nevertheless, weight-losing
patients are unable to perform an intensive physi￾cal having aimed at improving FFM. In addition,
low FFM is not the only factor involved in reduced
aerobic capacity [19] as reduced peripheral blood
flow; impaired energy metabolism with increased
rate of anaerobic metabolism, and lactate produc￾tion may play a further relevant role [20].
In the present study we hypothesised that those
limitations could be overcome by a supplementa￾tion of simple nutritional substrates, such as essen￾tial amino acids (EAAs). By our suggestion, the
effects of EAAs on patient with COPD could par￾tially surrogate (or contribute to) the effects of a
long-term, intensive, integrated rehabilitation [12].
Actually, EAAs could improve body weight and
FFM; peripheral muscle energy metabolism, and
exercise capacity. The rationale of using EAAs de￾rives from studies documenting the role of amino
acids in regulating protein synthesis [21]; enhanc￾ing aerobic metabolism [22], and biological activ￾ities of anabolic hormones such as insulin and in￾sulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [23, 24]. We al￾so formulated a second hypothesis, that EAAs
could improve per se the deterioration of both cog￾nitive dysfunction and health status perception
[25], which are highly prevalent in COPD [26].
This hypothesis is mainly based on the biological
property of several amino acids to act as precursor
of brain neurotransmitters [27] involved in cogni￾tion, motor function, mood.
Methods
Thirty-two consecutive out-patients (twenty￾seven males) suffering from stable severe COPD
(GOLD class 3-4) complicated with sarcopenia
and to be tested for cognitive dysfunction were re￾cruited and randomly assigned to EEAs (Aminotrofic,
Professional Dietetics, Milan, Italy) 4 g b.i.d. or in￾distinguishable placebo for twelve weeks accord￾ing to a double-blind design. 
Inclusion criteria were: age >40 years; baseline
post-brochodilator FEV1 ≤50% predicted; FEV1/
FVC ≤70%; BMI score ≤ 23.
Exclusion criteria were: age ≤40 years; base￾line post-bronchodilator FEV1 >50% predicted;
FEV1/FVC >70%; FEV1 reversibility >12% from
baseline after salbutamol 400 mcg; BMI score
≥23; bronchial asthma; diffuse interstitial pul￾monary diseases; the presence of any neoplasm; a
life expectancy <1 year; any mental deterioration
severely affecting the adherence to protocol proce￾dures and treatment assumption; lack of minimal
autonomy. Patients suffering from acute exacerba￾tion of COPD in the last four weeks were also ex￾cluded. All subjects gave their written informed
consent to the study.
Patients were checked in baseline (T0); after
four (T4), and after twelve (T12) weeks of treat￾ment. Variables collected at all the experimental
times were: 
• FEV1 and FVC (measured in liters and % pre￾dicted), and FEV1/FVC (%) (Masterscreen
Body Jaeger/Carefusion, Hoechberg, Ger￾many); 
• PaO2 and PaCO2 (mmHg); HbO2, and lactate
(mmol/l) in arterial blood samples drawn
anaerobically from the left radial artery (ABL
735 Analyzer, Radiometer, Copenhagen, DK); 
• BMI and the fat free mass (FFM, Kg) via im￾pedentiometric body composition analysis
(Tanita BC-420 MA; Tanita Corp., Tokyo,
Japan); 
• total protein and albumin concentration (g/l) in
blood; 
• the dyspnoea score (MRC scale);
• the Mini Mental Questionnaire score; 
• Quality of Life assessed in baseline and at the
end of both the twelve-week treatments by the
St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ);
• total number steps were measured daily at
home during patients’ free-living by the
SenseWear Armband PRO3 (BodyMedia;
Pittsburgh, PA, USA), continuously worn by
the patients for one week in baseline, and dur￾ing each fourth week of both treatments. 
In baseline, lung function was also preliminary
assessed before and thirty minutes after salbutamol
400mcg in order to check the patients’ short-term
reversibility (% change FEV1 from baseline).
Statistics
Descriptive statistics (mean ± standard devi￾ation) were reported for all the analysed vari￾ables. Baseline characteristics of the EAAs sup￾plemented group vs. placebo were compared by
means of a Student’s t test for unpaired data. A
repeated measures analysis of variance model
with one factor (Group) was applied to evaluate
trends over time for all the collected variables.
Statistical significance was expressed as the val￾ue of the time*Group interaction, testing the dif￾ferent trends between patients belonging to the
placebo or treated group. The Bonferroni post￾hoc test was also used to check any difference
among different time points within and between
curves. As significance level of p<0.05 has been
accepted.
Results
Patients’ characteristics in baseline
After randomisation, the two groups of sar￾copenic COPD patients were well matched in
terms of baseline lung function; body weight and
body composition; skeletal muscle metabolism;
physical activity; cognitive dysfunction, and al￾tered perception of their health status (table 1).
Both groups of patients were also comparable
in terms of increased plasma lactic acid levels,

with an average value 5-fold the upper limit for
our laboratory, thus indicating the prevalence of a
glucose anaerobic metabolism within their muscle
tissue, and suggesting the existence of a cell ener￾gy storage. Their similarity in body weight and fat
free mass was expected since patients were select￾ed for being sarcopenic. To note that all patients
were characterised by a substantial reduction of
their physical activity, being the total number of
steps just about 600 daily.
Patients also showed a reduction in liver pro￾tein synthesis of comparable extent as indicated by
a serum albumin concentration lower than 35g/l.
Furthermore, their cognitive status proved equally
mildly deteriorated as suggested by the Mini Men￾tal State Examination Test (MMSE), with a basal
score of 19 in the placebo and 20 in the EAAs
group, respectively. Finally, all patients perceived
their health status and quality life as very poor.
Of the correlations carried out among all vari￾ables (such as: lung function; nutritional status;
muscle metabolism; physical activity; cognitive
dysfunction, and health status perception), only
lactate and physical activity were significantly cor￾related (r= -0.35, p<0.05). In other words, sar￾copenic COPD patients with cognitive dysfunction
enrolled in the study were characterised by a
pathological blood gas tensions; muscle metabo￾lism, physical activity, and protein synthesis in
basal conditions.

Patients’ characteristics after intervention
The time courses of variables obtained after
placebo or EAAs supplementation showed that pa￾tients assuming EAAs, but not those assuming
placebo, progressively improved their nutritional
status; muscle metabolism; oxemia, daily physical
activity; cognitive capacity, and perception of
health status (table 2, figure 1).
At the end of the study (T12), a substantial
EAAs-associated increase in both body weight (+6
Kg, +11%) and FFM (+3.6 Kg; +8.9%); a drop in
lactate plasma levels (from 1.6±0.7 µmol/l to
1.3±0.6 µmol/l) was also observed, even if the cor￾responding absolute values still remained higher
than the reference normal values (-0.5/+0.5
µmol/l).
An unexpected increase in baseline blood oxy￾gen tension (PaO2 +4.6 mmHg; +75%) was found
at T12; interestingly, the improvement in PaO2 was
not associated with a concomitant improvement in
PaCO2.
Furthermore, EAAs supplementation was as￾sociated with an increased physical autonomy at
T12, resulting the baseline patients’ daily physical
activity improving by 80%. However, even if sig￾nificantly ameliorated, their physical activity still
remained severely limited.
Moreover, at the end of the study, EAAs sup￾plementation induced a significant increase in pro￾tein synthesis which changed from the basal value
of 32.7g/l to 37g/l (+4.3g/l).
Finally, both the cognitive dysfunction and
particularly the negative perception of their health
state were significantly ameliorated only in EAAs
supplemented patients; as concerning the latter as￾pect, the SGRQ score proved sistematically im￾proved from baseline (average drop of -2.7 points)
even if it did not reach the four-point variation
which is needed for claiming a substantial and ef￾fective benefit in patients’ quality of life. 
Discussion
Baseline patient characteristics
The present investigation proved that sarcope￾nia may be associated with exalted muscle anaero￾bic metabolism and reduced visceral protein syn￾thesis in stable, severe COPD patients at rest. This
biochemical condition is confirmed by the high
plasma lactate levels and the low serum albumin
concentration measured. Moreover, the presence
of hyperlactatemia indirectly indicates that the
muscle metabolism efficiency in producing energy
was basally reduced. 
These results are in line with those from previ￾ous studies that found a reduced muscle concen￾trations of energy substrates and cofactors [28] in
COPD patients. Actually, several factors (such as,
systemic inflammation; hypoxia, and muscle dis￾use) can cause an increased rate of muscle anaero￾bic metabolism in COPD [29].
In particular, it has been proved that inflam￾mation is able to induce cytokine production
[30, 31] which can affect muscle glucose metab￾olism by reducing pyruvate oxidation [32]. Fur￾thermore, hypoxia not only can affect glucose
transport in axial skeletal muscles [33], but can
also lead cell metabolism shifting from aerobic
metabolism to the anaerobic one [34], while a
low physical activity further impairs muscle aer￾obic metabolism [35]. The presence of this con￾dition may be suggested in most disabled pa￾tients, such as those with severe limitations in
washing, dressing, or walking less that 600 steps
per daily.
In general terms, the consequences of an in￾creased muscle anaerobic metabolism are deleteri￾ous for both the nutritional state and the exercise
capacity. Firstly, lactate-induced cell acidosis leads
to an exalted somatic and myofibrillar proteolysis
[36]. Moreover, a cellular energy shortage can re￾duce both the muscle protein synthesis [37] and
the physical activity as suggested by the negative
correlation between plasma lactate and the number
of steps performed by the patients in baseline con￾ditions. Consequently, skeletal muscles of sar￾copenic COPD patients are exposed to increased
muscle catabolism continuously.
The reduction in serum albumin concentra￾tions, which reflects a reduced liver synthesis rate
of non-reactant proteins, may be regarded as sec￾ondary to a chronic inadequacy in protein caloric
intake and/or the effect of systemic inflammation
with a shift of liver protein synthesis from non-re￾actant proteins to the inflammatory ones [38]. It is
possible that hypoxia contributed to reduce both
FFM and albumin synthesis as it stimulates tumour
necrosis factor alpha production [30, 31].
Patients of this study led a very sedentary
lifestyle. Alterations in their body composition;
ventilatory limitation [19]; muscle energy short￾age; and muscle cell acidosis can likely represent
factors which contributed to their impaired physi￾cal anatomy.
The present investigation also highlights the
presence of a substantial basal cognitive dysfunc￾tion in the study population. This is in agreement
with data from other important studies which
demonstrated the presence of an higher rate of
cognitive impairment [26] and a lower cognitive
performance in standardised measurement over￾time [25] among adults with COPD. It has also
been suggested that this cognitive deterioration
tends to reflect the severity of the COPD-induced
pulmonary dysfunction [25]. Other studies linked
the severity of the cognitive deterioration to the
extent of lung function impairment in terms of
FEV1 [39], and to brain perfusion abnormalities
secondary to hypoxemia [40]. However, although
we did not find any significant correlation between
oxemia, lactate and cognitive test, the impaired
blood gas pressures could have influenced the per￾formance in cognitive test [41].
The clinical consequences of altered cognition
can be relevant for COPD patients because cogni￾tive dysfunction may further reduce patient adher￾ence to therapeutic programs; enhance patients’
disability, and decrease their quality of life [42].

Effects of EAAs on patient variables
EAAS AND BODY COMPOSITION
The 3.6 Kg improvement in FFM following
EAA supplementation is impressive when consid￾ering the 1.1 Kg gain of FFM obtained after a 8-
week period of pulmonary rehabilitation [12].
It is interesting to note that the 10% increase in
FFM observed in the present study after EAAs
supplementation is close to the 11.8% increase in
skeletal mass obtained in patients suffering from
COPD after a two-month supplementation with the
same formula used in the current investigation
[43]. 
Nevertheless, the increase obtained in body
weight (+6 Kg) in the present study is higher than
that obtained in previous investigations showing a
weight stability after a nutritional supplementation
(+570 Kcal from carbohydrates; via 800 mg/day of

megestrol acetate for eight weeks) combined with
pulmonary rehabilitation [44]. This difference can
likely be related to the characteristics of the sub￾strate used because megestrol is known to mainly
increase fat mass (FM) and not muscle tissue, be￾ing mechanisms underlining the effects of EAAs
both direct and indirect. 
In fact, EAAs directly stimulate protein syn￾thesis [45] and inhibit proteolysis [46] in several
tissue including skeletal muscle and the liver. The
peculiar activity of EAAs in these districts may ex￾plain the amelioration of both FFM and albumin
synthesis. To note that EAA-promoted protein syn￾thesis is independent of insulin [21]: this feature
represents a relevant aspect particularly for those
COPD patients with insulin-resistance and follow￾ing a long-term corticosteroid therapy, and/or dur￾ing acute exacerbations. In addition, the stimula￾tion of protein anabolism by EAAs could benefit
sarcopenic patients with diminished circulating
levels of anabolic hormones including testos￾terone, growth hormone and insulin-like growth
factor (IGF-1) [47]. 
EAAs may indirectly exert their activity on
muscle and liver protein synthesis by augmented
the biological activity of IGF-1 [24].
EAAS AND MUSCLE METABOLISM
The study proved that EAAs supplementation,
but not placebo, is associated with a significant re￾duction in plasma lactate (figure 1).
The improvement in lactate formation could be
due to the effects of EAAs on muscle metabolism
as EAAs can stimulate the aerobic energy-produc￾ing pathway [37] both directly by entering the aer￾obic cycle as alternative substrate [37], and indi￾rectly by shifting lactate pyruvate reaction to the
right [37]. In this way EAAs could overcome the
block of glucose aerobic oxidation caused by pro￾inflammatory cytokines via the aerobic metabo￾lism re-activation [32].
EAAS AND DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Data from the present study also proved the
progressive improvement in daily physical activity
in EAAs-supplemented patients, even though their
physical autonomy remained greatly limited, being
the total steps daily performed by supplemented
EAAs about 1085 after a three-month supplemen￾tation.
The improvement in patients’ walking capaci￾ty may be related to several factors including the
improvement in their nutritional state, aerobic me￾tabolism, body anabolism (albumin). All these fac￾tors can also ameliorate patients’ motivation to
physical activity. The different mechanisms con￾tributing to improve physical capacity may likely
account for the absence of any significant relation￾ship between lactatemia and physical activity that
we found at the patients’ randomisation time. An
important factor that could improve the physical
activity might be the increase in muscle strength,
not measured in the study. It is reasonable to pre￾sume the amelioration of muscle strength as pa￾tients ameliorated both their FFM and aerobic me￾tabolism. 
EAAS AND BLOOD OXYGEN TENSION
The gradual improvement in PaO2 following
EAAs was unexpected. A speculative explanation
is that the improvement in PaO2 could be due to
EAA influence on cardiac function [48] which can
ameliorate pulmonary blood flux/distribution. A
better oxemia may be crucial for COPD evolution
as it should reduce the stimulus to cytokine pro￾duction and decrease the release of both inter￾leukin 1 and tumour necrosis factor alpha in hu￾man alveolar macrophages [49]. Reduction of
chronic hypoxemia may also contribute to increase
FFM and body weight in the patients of the study.
EAAS AND COGNITION AND HEALTH STATUS
The increase in blood oxygen tension may en￾hance brain perfusion that on the contrary is re￾duced by chronic hypoxia [41]; brain hypoperfu￾sion is also hypothesised to affect cognitive per￾formance in these patients [40].
Moreover, we tend to emphasize that the
EAAs-associated improvement in cognition
should be related to both the oxemia amelioration
and the increased availability of neurotransmitters’
amino acids precursors in the brain. In fact, amino
acids used in the present study contain several pre￾cursors of brain neurotransmitters that play an im￾portant role in cognition, motor function and mood
[50], such as: brain norepinephrine, dopamine, ep￾inephrine transmitters derived from tyrosine; sero￾tonine from tryptophan; acetylcholine from me￾thionine; histamine from histidine. It is important
to note that the brain of hypoxic COPD subjects
need an increased amount of neurotransmitter pre￾cursors as hypoxia facilitates per se the circulating
levels of catecholamines through mechanisms in￾volving the increased synthesis and/or release [51,
52] of acetylcholine [53].
The improvement in the patient perception of
health status may be a consequence of the in￾creased body weight and FFM; body anabolic ori￾entation (total protein and albumin synthesis);
higher oxemia, and reduction in cognitive impair￾ment.
The amelioration of cognition and health status
could have relevant clinical consequences which
include improvements in patient adherence to
treatment and maintenance of their independence
over time [25].
Clinical perspectives
Results of the present study accord with data
from two recent studies carried out on cachectic
COPD [54] and on muscle-depleted patients with
chronic heart failure [55] which were both supple￾mented with the same aminoacid formula (at the
same dose) as that used in the present investiga￾tion.

R.W. DAL NEGRO ET AL.
The study suggests that EAAs might results
particularly useful in those COPD patients who
cannot undergo to rehabilitation for any reason, or
cannot perform any intensive physical training due
to the presence of severe comorbidities, or to the
subject subject’s frailty being too severe.
It is also presumable that EAAs may act syn￾ergistically with rehabilitation and optimise corre￾sponding outcomes in terms of the recover of nu￾tritional status, cognitive dysfunction and quality
of life in severe COPD patients with sarcopenia. 
Limitations of the study
We are aware that the present study has some
limitations. First, the small number of the patients’
sample precluded any conclusion on possible gen￾der-related difference in the results.
Second, patients were not investigated in terms
of their daily nutritional intake, and this particular
aspect might be relevant when evaluating the pos￾sible role of EAA supplementation in affecting
protein caloric intake effectively. 
Finally, patients were not followed after EAA
discontinuation and then we can not draw any con￾clusion on maintenance of changes overtime. Con￾versely, the study was planned only with the aim of
investigating whether or not EAAs could have any
impact on sarcopenic condition of severe COPD
patients.
In conclusion, even if further larger investiga￾tions are needed in the future to face specifically
all these aspects and validate present data, the ac￾tual results from the present study emphasisethat a
three-month EAAs supplementation in sarcopenic
patients with severe COPD can lead to a substan￾tial improvements in the patient’s body weight and
body composition; peripheral muscle anaerobic
metabolism; oxemia; daily physical activity; cog￾nitive function, and perception of their own health
status.
