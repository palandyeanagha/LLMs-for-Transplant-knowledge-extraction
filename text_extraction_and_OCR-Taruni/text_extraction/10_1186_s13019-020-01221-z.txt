Heart-lung transplantation for idiopathic
pulmonary arterial hypertension and giant
pulmonary artery aneurysm – case report
T. Eadington1* , K. Santhanakrishnan1 and R. Venkateswaran1,2
Abstract
Backgound: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a rare condition that requires lung transplantation
in patients’ refractory to medical therapy. Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is a documented complication of IPAH
however, optimal management and timing of intervention for this rare entity is not well understood.
Case report: We report a case of a 51-year-old female who underwent heart-lung transplantation for IPAH and
giant PAA. The extreme size of the PAA and underlying pathology encountered in this case precluded both lung
transplantation and conventional aneurysm repair.
Conclusion: This case demonstrates that heart-lung transplantation is a good surgical option for IPAH complicated
by giant sized PAA and right heart failure.

transplantation
Background
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic lung
disorder characterised by a progressive and pathological
remodelling of the resistance pulmonary arteries. The
resulting pulmonary vasoconstriction causes an abnor￾mal increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, impairing
pulmonary circulation and increasing the workload on
the heart due to a chronically increased right ventricular
afterload [1, 2]. There are several different causes of
PAH as described under group 1 of the WHO classifica￾tion of pulmonary hypertension [3], with the idiopathic
subtype seen in this case accounting for approximately
39% of these [4]. Whilst the incidence of the condition is
not fully understood, it is rare, with an estimate between
2.5–7.1 cases/million with a female:male predominance
of between 1.8–3.6: 1 [5, 6]. Historic studies in the US
reported the mean age of onset of IPAH as 36 +/− 15
years [7], however results from more recent registries
have reported a much higher mean age of onset (53 +/−
14 years) [8]. PAH has previously been defined by a
mean pulmonary arterial pressure at rest of ≥25 mmHg
at rest with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤ 15
mmHg [9]. However, this arbitrary definition remains a
point of debate [10].
Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) has been described
as a dilatation of the pulmonary artery beyond the nor￾mal upper limit of diameter of 29 mm. Some have pro￾posed a definition of dilatation above 4 cm however an
exact definition remains unclear [11, 12]. They are a very
rare finding with an approximate incidence of 1:14000
[13] and as a result there is currently no agreement on
how or when to treat these entities for optimum out￾comes. PAA have a wide range of causes both congenital
and acquired; however, they do have a strong association
with PAH. Aneurysm formation and progression is

associated with vessel wall stress and rupture carries an
extremely high mortality rate (50–100%) [14].
Further classification of ‘giant’ PAA has been
attempted. Some have suggested a cut off-of 6 cm to de￾fine the label of ‘giant’ and others 8cm [15, 16]. Optimal
management of these very large PAAs is even more diffi￾cult to determine. In some cases correction of pulmon￾ary valve distortion has been sufficient to preserve right
ventricular function [15] whilst others advocate surgical
repair of the PAA when size exceeds 8cm [16]. Surgical
repair of large PAA has been described in the presence
of pulmonary hypertension [17] however, this is the first
report of a patient with IPAH and a PAA of such ex￾treme size with concurrent right heart failure.
Case presentation
This is the case of a 51-year-old female with a past med￾ical history of IPAH. This had been diagnosed by right
heart catheterization 16 years previously when the pa￾tient collapsed at home shortly after childbirth. The pa￾tient’s condition was stable for many years, being
medically managed with intravenous iloprost at 1300 μg
once daily. This allowed the patient an acceptable quality
of life maintaining a WHO functional class II.
A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram in
2013 diagnosed a 5.5 cm PAA, worst affecting the main
and left pulmonary arteries. Right heart catheter per￾formed at this time demonstrated pulmonary artery
pressure of 90/39 mmHg (mean 31 mmHg), right ven￾tricular pressure of 93/10, end diastolic diastolic pres￾sure of 20 mmHg and a mean right atrial pressure of 13
mmHg. Due to the progression of the underlying path￾ology additional pulmonary antihypertensives were
added to the treatment plan (sildenafil and ambrisentan).
The patient was considered for bilateral orthotopic lung
transplantation but after assessment was deemed too
clinically well to list for transplant at that time and the
patient continued to be monitored by their local
hospital.
Clinical deterioration prompted review at our centre
in 2019, which identified worsening symptoms of short￾ness of breath, causing severe limitation of daily function
(WHO functional class III-IV), and left shoulder pain.
Echocardiography revealed marked progression of the
PAA causing dilatation of the pulmonary valve annulus
and subsequent severe pulmonary regurgitation. There
was also severe right ventricular impairment, moderate
tricuspid regurgitation and a 4 cm pericardial effusion
lateral to the left ventricular wall. Pulmonary artery pres￾sure was estimated at > 65 mmHg.
Computed tomography pulmonary angiography con￾firmed a 12 cm aneurysm of the pulmonary artery
mainly affecting the main and left pulmonary arteries.
There was also a 6 cm aneurysm of the right pulmonary
artery (Fig. 1). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging con￾firmed a right ventricular ejection fraction of 23% (this
had been 40% at the previous assessment). A chest x-ray
demonstrated marked cardiomegaly, tracheal deviation,
and an extremely widened mediastinum extending into
the left hemi-thorax (Fig. 2).
Due to the presence of a giant PAA, severe pulmonary
regurgitation and a 4 cm pericardial effusion, it was de￾cided to list the patient for heart-lung transplantation.
Episodes of right heart failure were managed with ino￾tropes and the patient was maintained on pulmonary an￾tihypertensive medications and diuretics whilst awaiting
transplantation.
Approach via median sternotomy revealed the large
aneurysm sac which was translucent to blood. The space
occupying effect caused lateral deviation of the aorta, as
well as inferior displacement of the heart into the
diaphragm (Fig. 3). It also extended well into the left
hemi-thorax, severely compromising the left lung. Car￾diopulmonary bypass was established via aortic and bi￾caval cannulation and the patient cooled to 34 °C.
Dissection of the pulmonary artery allowed identification
of the ligamentum arteriosus and safe dissection of the
left recurrent laryngeal nerve (Fig. 4). Following dissec￾tion and preservation of the phrenic nerves the recipient
heart and lungs were explanted. The donor heart-lung
block was prepared and implanted and after haemostasis
was confirmed, primary chest closure was performed.
The patient was started on an induction immunosup￾pressive regime and transferred to the cardiac intensive
care unit in a stable condition. A post-operative chest x￾ray was performed which was normal (Fig. 5). The only
significant post-operative complication was a below￾knee deep vein thrombosis which was easily managed
with enoxaparin. The patient was discharged 34d post￾operatively and follow-up for 13 months since discharge
has confirmed good progress.
Discussion and conclusion
This case highlights the difficulties in managing patients
with IPAH that are complicated by PAA. Timing of inter￾vention for PAA is difficult as there is no evidence based
guidelines on when this is best undertaken. For patients
with IPAH complicated by PAA there is even less evi￾dence to help guide decision making, and this case was
complicated further by the extreme size of the aneurysm
and the degree of right ventricular failure. Early double
lung transplantation had been considered several years be￾fore the eventual heart-lung transplant, however the pa￾tient was clinically stable with medical management and
did not qualify for listing at that time.
Bilateral lung transplant can be done in most pulmonary
hypertension patients, even those with severe right ven￾tricular dysfunction. Whilst bilateral lung transplantation
Eadington et al. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020) 15:169 Page 2 of 6

has been utilised in the presence of PAA [18], the reason
for considering heart and lung transplant in this scenario
was due to the giant PAA size, severe pulmonary regurgi￾tation due to annular dilatation and 4 cm pericardial effu￾sion. The limitation of this approach is the increasing
demand and short supply of suitable donor organs. The
giant size of the aneurysm later in the disease progression
meant lung transplantation would not have been possible
in this case, and this would also not address the concur￾rent pulmonary valve dilatation and subsequent right ven￾tricular failure. Another theoretical option would have
been a graft repair of the aneurysm and pulmonary valve

repair/replacement. However, this would have been ex￾tremely high risk, even more so in the presence of IPAH,
and not feasible due to the extreme size of the aneurysm.
Also, this would not address the patient’s progressive lung
disease and would have potentially left the patient later
requiring lung transplantation, a second major surgical
intervention. Other examples of graft repair have been de￾scribed for giant PAA [17] however, the aneurysm de￾scribed in this patient is significantly larger than others
reported, and none report such severe pulmonary valve

disease and right heart failure. This case also highlights
the importance of regular imaging to monitor the progres￾sion of IPAH complicated by PAA.
In conclusion, this case demonstrates that heart-lung
transplantation is a good surgical option for difficult cases
of IPAH complicated by giant PAA and right ventricular
failure. However, this remains a procedure that is very
rarely performed. The constant demand for organs and
short supply of suitable donors means that there is a risk
that these patients may not find a suitable donor before
deterioration makes them unsuitable for transplantation.
The use of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation has
been successful as a bridge to transplant in cases of severe
deterioration of IPAH [19]. Despite this, timing of inter￾vention to optimise survival will continue to be a chal￾lenge in this complex group of patients.
