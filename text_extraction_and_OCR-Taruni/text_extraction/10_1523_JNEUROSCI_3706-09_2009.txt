In recent years, theoretical perspectives on posterior parietal function have evolved beyond the traditional visuospatial processing
models to include more diverse cognitive operations, such as long-term and working memory. However, definitive neuropsychological
evidence supporting the superior parietal lobule’s purported role in working memory has been lacking. Here, we studied human brain lesion
patients to determine whether the superior parietal lobule is indeed necessary for working memory. We assessed a wide range of memory
functions in three participant groups: superior parietal lesions (n  19), lesions not involving superior parietal cortex (n  146), and no brain
lesions (n  55). Superior parietal damage was reliably associated with deficits on tests involving the manipulation and rearrangement of
information in working memory, but not on working memory tests requiring only rehearsal and retrieval processes, nor on tests of long-term
memory. These results indicate that superior parietal cortex is critically important for the manipulation of information in working memory.
Introduction
For decades, research on the function of superior aspects of the
posterior parietal cortex (PPC) largely focused on visuospatial
and attentional processing (Critchley, 1953; Colby and Goldberg,
1999; Nachev and Husain, 2006; Sack, 2009; Vandenberghe and
Gillebert, 2009). More recently, this classic conception has been
supplemented by a host of functional neuroimaging studies that
reliably associate posterior parietal cortex activity with tasks in￾volving long-term and working memory (Wager and Smith,
2003; Wagner et al., 2005; Cabeza et al., 2008). Despite the consis￾tently observed correlation between activity in the superior parietal
lobule (SPL) of the PPC and working memory task performance
(Wager and Smith, 2003), there is sparse neuropsychological evi￾dence to corroborate the importance of SPL in working memory. Of
the neurological patient studies that have addressed the role of PPC
in working memory (Warrington et al., 1971; Saffran and Marin,
1975; Husain et al., 2001; Pisella et al., 2004; Malhotra et al., 2005;
Ravizza et al., 2005; Baldo and Dronkers, 2006; van Asselen et al.,
2006; Berryhill and Olson, 2008a,b), all share one or more of the
following features: small number of cases with PPC damage, lesions
primarily involving inferior (rather than superior) PPC, and exclu￾sive use of visual-spatial or auditory-verbal working memory tests.
In other words, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of
working memoryfunction in a relatively large group of patients with
damage specifically involving superior parietal cortex, and across a
broad range of tasks and stimulus material. The absence of such data
represents a substantial gap in the understanding of both parietal
lobe function and the neural substrates of working memory. Here,
we characterize working memory function in a group of patients
with focal brain lesions involving superior parietal cortex.
Materials and Methods
Participant data
We drew participants from the Phase 3 Vietnam Head Injury Study
(VHIS) registry, which includes American veterans who suffered brain
damage from penetrating head injuries in the Vietnam War (n  199), as
well as neurologically healthy Vietnam veterans (n  55). To preclude
the possibility that defective performance on working memory tests
could be secondary to deficits in the production and/or comprehension
of language, rather than due to a primary deficit in working memory per
se, we excluded any participant who had significant impairment (defined
as performance at least two SDs below the mean of the neurologically
healthy group) on tests of language production and language compre￾hension (supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as sup￾plemental material). From the remaining brain-injured veterans we
selected those with significant damage to SPL in either hemisphere (Sup￾Par Lesion group; n  19) (Fig. 1; supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material), as well as a comparison group of
brain-injured veterans whose damage did not include SPL in either
hemisphere (NonSupPar Lesion group; n  146). The neurologically
healthy veterans (No Lesion group; n  55) served as an additional
comparison group. Demographic and background cognitive function
data for the three groups are presented in Table 1.

of penetrating metal fragments in the patient sample. We acquired Axial
CT scans without contrast at Bethesda Naval Hospital on a GE Medical
Systems Light Speed Plus CT scanner in helical mode. We reconstructed
the images with an in-plane voxel size of 0.4  0.4 mm, overlapping
slice thickness of 2.5 mm and a 1 mm slice interval. We determined
lesion location and volume from CT images using the Analysis of
Brain Lesion (ABLe) software (Makale et al., 2002;
Solomon et al., 2007) contained in MEDx v3.44 (Medical Numerics)
with enhancements to support the Automated Anatomical Labeling
(AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). As part of this process, we
spatially normalized the CT image of each subject’s brain to a CT
Template brain image in MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute)
space (Collins et al., 1994). We calculated lesion volume by manual
tracing of the lesion in all relevant slices of the CT image then sum￾ming the traced areas and multiplying by slice thickness. A trained
neuropsychiatrist performed the manual tracing, which was then re￾viewed by J.G., who was blind to the results of the neuropsychological
testing. The superior parietal region of interest was defined as the area
of parietal lobe (including gray and white matter) superior and me￾dial to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS).
Neuropsychological tests
Language production and comprehension. In the Boston Naming Test
(Goodglass and Kaplan, 2000), the subject views a series of 60 ink draw￾ings of objects and attempts to name aloud each item. In the Token Test
(Boller and Vignolo, 1966), the subject attempts to follow a series of 62
oral commands (e.g., “Touch the green square and the blue circle”). The
Verbal Comprehension Index is a composite of scores from the Informa￾tion, Similarities, and Vocabulary tests from the Wechsler Adult Intelli￾gence Scale-III (Wechsler, 1997a).
Working memory. In Digit Span Forward (Wechsler, 1997a), the sub￾ject hears a sequence of digits and attempts to repeat the sequence in
order. Sequence length is increased until the subject can no longer cor￾rectly repeat the sequence. Digit Span Backward (Wechsler, 1997a) is the
same as Digit Span Forward, except the subject attempts to repeat the
sequence in reverse order. In Spatial Span Forward (Wechsler, 1997a),
the subject watches the examiner tap a sequence of locations on a board
and attempts to repeat the tapping sequence in order. Sequence length is
increased until the subject can no longer correctly repeat the sequence.
Spatial Span Backward (Wechsler, 1997a) is the same as Spatial Span
Forward, except the subject attempts to repeat the sequence in reverse
order. In Letter-Number Sequencing (Wechsler, 1997a), the subject
hears a sequence of alternating digits and letters and attempts to repeat
the digits and letters from the sequence, beginning with the digits in
numerical order, followed by the letters in alphabetical order. In Arith￾metic (Wechsler, 1997a), the subject hears numerical problems in story
format, performs mental arithmetic (i.e., without paper and pencil), and
makes a verbal response. In the N-Back test, the subject hears a series of
digits, and for each new digit, reports whether the new digit is the same as
the digit “n” steps back.
Long-term memory. In Logical Memory (Wechsler, 1997b), the subject
hears two brief stories, and after each story immediately attempts to recall
the story (immediate recall). After 30 min, the subject attempts a second
recall for each story (delayed recall). In Faces (Wechsler, 1997b), the
subject views a series of 24 pictures of faces and then immediately there￾after a series of 48 face pictures including the 24 previously seen targets
interspersed among 24 foils, and indicates whether or not each face was
previously seen (immediate recognition). After 30 min a second recog￾nition test is performed with 24 new foils (delayed recognition). In
Verbal-Paired Associates (Wechsler, 1997b), the subject hears eight
word-pairs. In the test portion the first word of the pair is presented, and
the subject attempts to recall the second word of the pair. The test is
administered immediately after the word-pair presentations (immediate
recall) and 30 min later (delayed recall). In Family Pictures (Wechsler,
1997b), the subject views a picture of six family members, and then views
individual pictures that contain four of the family members interacting
in various situations. Subjects attempt to report on the identity, location,
and action of each character in each picture, once immediately after the
picture is removed (immediate recall) and once after 30 min (delayed
recall).
Visuo-spatial rearrangement. In the Tower Test (Delis et al., 2001),
subjects attempt to rearrange discs on a set of pegs to match a model.
In Block Design (Wechsler, 1997a), subjects attempt to rearrange
multicolored blocks to match a model design. In Object Assembly
(Wechsler, 1997a), subjects attempt to rearrange puzzle pieces to
form familiar objects.

Results
Working memory function
To determine the effect of SPL lesions on working memory
performance, we analyzed data from several canonical tests of
working memory: Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward,
Spatial Span Forward, Spatial Span Backward, Letter-Number
Sequencing, Arithmetic, and N-Back (Table 2, supplemental
Figs. 2–7, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material).
To summarize the results reported in Table 2 and supplemen￾tal Figure 2–7 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material), there were no significant group differences for the tests
that required sustained attention but minimal working memory
demands (0-Back and 1-Back), or tests that required the simple
retention and recall of information from working memory (Digit
Span Forward and Spatial Span Forward), regardless of whether
the stimuli were auditory-verbal (Digit Span Forward) or visual￾spatial (Spatial Span Forward). However, there were significant
group differences for those tests that required the additional ma￾nipulation or rearrangement of information within working
memory (Digit Span Backward, Spatial Span Backward, Letter￾Number Sequencing, and Arithmetic), as well as for the more
demanding working memory conditions of the N-Back test
(2-Back and 3-Back). For all working memory tests that re￾vealed a significant difference among groups, the SupPar Le￾sion group’s performance was significantly worse than one or
both comparison groups. The NonSupPar Lesion group’s per￾formance was not significantly different than the No Lesion
group on any of the tests. These data suggest that SPL damage
specifically impairs the manipulation and rearrangement of
information in working memory. However, to substantiate
this conclusion, it is necessary to examine several factors that
are relevant to the interpretation of the observed results: (1)
lesion size, (2) damage to areas adjacent to SPL (in particular,
inferior parietal lobule), (3) lesion laterality, and (4) specific￾ity of the cognitive deficit.
Lesion size
As can be seen in Table 1, the mean lesion size of the SupPar
Lesion group is significantly greater than the NonSupPar Lesion
group. Thus, the SupPar Lesion group’s relatively poor perfor￾mance on six of the working memory tests (Digit Span Backward,
Spatial Span Backward, Letter-Number Sequencing, Arithmetic,
2-back, and 3-back) could conceivably be due to a difference in
lesion size, rather than a difference in lesion location. We ad￾dressed this possibility with two analyses. In the first analysis, we
determined the correlations between lesion size and performance
on the six key tests. For the NonSupPar Lesion group, the abso￾lute values of all Pearson’s r values were 0.07 or less, and the
corresponding p values were 0.45 or greater (supplemental Table
2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). For
the SupPar Lesion group, the absolute values of all Pearson’s r
values were 0.26 or less, and the corresponding p values were 0.29
or greater (supplemental Table 3, available at www.jneurosci.org
as supplemental material). Thus, in both brain-injured patient
groups, lesion size had no significant correlation with perfor￾mance on any of the six tests. In the second analysis, we selected
the subset of patients from the NonSupPar Lesion group with the
largest lesions (n  54), such that the mean lesion size in this
NonSupPar Lesion “large lesion” subset (62.7 cm3
) was nearly
identical to the mean lesion size in the SupPar Lesion group (62.6
cm3
). We then compared these two groups’ performance on each
of the six key tests (supplemental Table 4, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Mirroring the main
analysis (Table 2), the SupPar Lesion group was significantly
worse than the NonSupPar Lesion large lesion subset on Digit
Span Backward ( p  0.004), Letter-Number Sequencing ( p 
0.02), and Arithmetic ( p  0.001), and nearly so on Spatial Span
Backward ( p  0.05) and 2-back errors ( p  0.08). Together,
these two analyses converge to indicate that lesion size, in and of
itself, does not account for the observed pattern of results.
Involvement of inferior parietal cortex
As can be seen in Figure 1, some of the lesions in the SupPar
Lesion group extend beyond the boundaries of SPL. In most areas
of the brain outside SPL, the number of overlapping lesions is
small (0, 1, or 2). However, right inferior parietal cortex is an
exception; approximately half the patients in SupPar Lesion
group have damage involving this area. Thus, the impaired per￾formance of the SupPar Lesion group could conceivably be due to
the damage to right inferior parietal cortex, rather than to SPL.
To address this possibility, we selected two groups for a follow-up
analysis (Fig. 2). From the NonSupPar Lesion group we selected
those patients with damage that primarily involved right inferior
parietal cortex (with minimal superior parietal involvement; n 
6), and from the SupPar Lesion group we selected those patients
with damage that primarily involved SPL (with minimal inferior
parietal involvement; n  6). Mean lesion size was similar be￾tween these two groups (35.1 cm3 for the right inferior group,
40.1 cm3 for the superior group; t  0.3; p  0.79). We then

compared the performance of these two groups, along with the
No Lesion group, to determine whether focal lesions to either
right inferior parietal cortex or SPL would result in working
memory impairment (Table 3). The group of patients with focal
right inferior parietal lesions exhibited no significant differences
from the No Lesion group on any of the working memory mea￾sures. The group of patients with focal superior parietal lesions,
on the other hand, exhibited significantly worse performance
than the No Lesion group on Digit Span Backward ( p  0.007),
Letter-Number Sequencing ( p  0.006), Arithmetic ( p  0.005)
and 2-back ( p  0.03), as well as significantly worse performance
than the patients with focal right inferior parietal lesions on Digit
Span Backward ( p  0.007), Letter-Number Sequencing ( p 
0.006), Arithmetic ( p  0.005), and 2-back ( p  0.02). In addi￾tion, we examined the performance of those individuals with
lesions involving both superior and inferior parietal areas (n 
11; supplemental Table 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material). As expected, this group of inferior
superior parietal lesions performed significantly worse than the
right inferior parietal lesion group on all working memory ma￾nipulation tests (Digit Span Backward p  0.006; Spatial Span
Backward p  0.005; Letter-Number Sequencing p  0.03; Arith￾metic p  0.005; 2-back p  0.009; 3-back p  0.03), but similarly
to the group of focal superior lesions (all p values 0.30). These
data indicate that superior parietal damage, but not right inferior
parietal damage, is sufficient to yield impairments in the manip￾ulation and rearrangement of information in working memory.
Lesion laterality
Because the majority of patients in the original SupPar Lesion
group had unilateral lesions, we were able to examine the effect of
lesion laterality on working memory performance by dividing the
SupPar Lesion group into those patients with exclusively right
hemisphere lesions (n  9) and those with exclusively left hemi￾sphere lesions (n  4; supplemental Table 6, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The remaining six
individuals had lesions that involved both cerebral hemispheres,
although not necessarily involving the superior parietal cortex in
both hemispheres. The only significant difference between the
right and left hemisphere lesion groups was on Spatial Span Back￾ward, where patients with right superior parietal lesions per￾formed significantly worse than patients with left superior
parietal lesions ( p  0.03). These results suggest that lesion lat￾erality within SPL may be a critical factor for working memory
involving visuospatial manipulation, but not in working memory
test performance more generally. However, due to the exclusion
of subjects with significant language impairment, most of whom
had left hemisphere lesions, the relatively small number of left

unilateral SPL lesions included in this study (n  4) precludes any
definitive conclusions about SPL lesion laterality.
Specificity of cognitive deficit
The working memory results, coupled with previous studies sug￾gesting a role for parietal cortex in long-term memory processing
(Wagner et al., 2005; Cabeza et al., 2008), raise the question of
whether superior parietal lesions specifically impair working
memory processes, or whether they impair more general encod￾ing or retrieval processes that would also affect long-term mem￾ory. To answer this question, we compared the performance of
the SupPar Lesion, NonSupPar Lesion, and No Lesion groups on
four tests of long-term memory from the Wechsler Memory
Scale-III (Wechsler, 1997b): Logical Memory, Faces, Verbal￾Paired Associates, and Family Pictures. The difference in scores
between the “immediate” and “delayed” tests (“immediate 
delayed” score) is an index of long-term memory retention. Table
4 shows the group means for immediate, delayed, and immedi￾ate  delayed scores for each of the four tests. The SupPar Lesion
group was not significantly different from either comparison
group on the immediate  delayed scores for any of the four tests,
nor was the SupPar Lesion group significantly different from
either comparison group on the immediate and delayed condi￾tions of Logical Memory and Verbal-Paired Associates, both of
which have auditory-verbal stimuli. The SupPar Lesion group
did score significantly lower than the No Lesion group on certain
components of the tests with visual stimuli (specifically, the im￾mediate and delayed recall for Family Pictures, as well as the
delayed recognition for Faces), but the NonSupPar Lesion group
also scored significantly lower than the No Lesion group on tests
with visual stimuli (specifically, the immediate and delayed rec￾ognition for Faces). Unlike the working memory tests, where the
SupPar Lesion group (and only the SupPar Lesion group) exhib￾ited deficits in both auditory-verbal and visual-spatial domains,
these long-term memory tests reveal no pervasive memory defi￾cits specific to superior parietal damage.
Another possibility is that superior parietal damage may not
only impair the manipulation and rearrangement of information
in working memory, but rather, may impair rearrangement or
reordering processes more broadly. To address this possibility,
we compared the performance of the SupPar Lesion, NonSupPar
Lesion, and No Lesion groups on three cognitive tests that require
reordering or rearrangement processes, but not the retention of
information in working memory: Tower Test, Block Design, and
Object Assembly. Although the scores of the SupPar Lesion group
were, on average, lower than the comparison groups’ scores for
each of these three tests, none of the differences reached statistical
significance (Table 5). These data suggest that the effect of supe￾rior parietal lesions on mental rearrangement and manipulation
may indeed be specific to working memory. However, we regard
this conclusion as provisional due to the fact that the nonworking
memory rearrangement tests are not necessarily equivalent to the
working memory tests in terms of task difficulty or variance in
performance. It is possible that the superior parietal lesion pa￾tients have broad manipulation/rearrangement deficits that are
particularly revealed by tasks with an additional cognitive load,
such as the mnemonic component of the working memory tests.
Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether SPL plays a critical role in
human working memory. Using a relatively large sample of pa￾tients with superior parietal damage (n  19) and a wide-ranging
assessment of cognitive function, we report several main find￾ings: (1) SPL lesions are associated with deficits in the manipulation
and rearrangement of informationwithinworkingmemory, but not
the simple retention and retrieval of information in working mem￾ory; (2) SPL lesions are associated with deficits in the manipulation
and rearrangement of information within working memory for
both auditory-verbal and visual-spatial stimuli; and (3) SPL le￾sions are not associated with pervasive deficits in tests of long￾term memory or spatial rearrangement not involving working
memory. Together, these results suggest that SPL is critically im￾portant for the manipulation and rearrangement of information
in working memory.
One issue that is not directly addressed by our data is whether
the observed cognitive deficits subsequent to SPL lesions are due
to damage to the SPL gray matter, or whether the cognitive defi￾cits instead arise from damage to the subjacent white matter

pathways that link SPL with areas such as IPS or lateral frontal
cortex. Indeed, most neurobiological models of working mem￾ory and executive function implicate a frontoparietal network
(Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000; Corbetta and Shulman,
2002), and clearly the SPL lesions in this study involve both gray
and white matter damage (Fig. 1; supplemental Fig. 1, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). One can assume
that in addition to the clearly delineated tissue loss in and beneath
SPL, there would also likely be some degree of secondary degen￾eration of the affected white matter pathways that is undetectable
with CT. Although the secondary white matter damage in our
sample is likely comparable to that of ischemic stroke, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, or surgicalresection, we must certainly acknowledge
that degenerative white matter damage may exacerbate the cog￾nitive deficits in our patients. However, there are two lines of
evidence that suggest widespread white matter damage, and more
specifically frontoparietal tract damage, is not primarily respon￾sible for the observed results. First is the comparable performance
of SPL patients to the neurologically healthy vets on many of the
cognitive tests (e.g., Digit Span Forward, 0-Back, 1-Back, Tower
Test, language tests, and verbal long-term memory tests). This
pattern of cognitive performance starkly contrasts that of patients
with brain injuries involving diffuse white matter damage (such
as traumatic brain injury), who typically exhibit deficits in atten￾tion, executive function, and long-term memory (Lezak et al.,
2004). Second is the observation that individuals from the
VHIS sample with dorsolateral PFC lesions (n  21) exhibit
no significant impairment (relative to the neurologically
healthy comparison vets) on any tests of working memory
retention or manipulation (Digit Span, Spatial Span, N-Back,
Letter-Number Sequencing, or Arithmetic). (These data have
been submitted as a separate manuscript.) Since these dorso￾lateral PFC lesions also intersect frontoparietal white matter
pathways and most certainly disrupt frontal lobe function to a
greater extent than the SPL lesions, we conclude that SPL
lesions impair working memory manipulation through their
effects within superior parietal cortex, rather than through
downstream effects on frontal lobe.
Our findings are germane to several areas of research. One
related area is functional neuroimaging research on the neural
correlates of working memory. The neurological patient data
reported here are consistent with a meta-analysis of dozens of
functional imaging studies (Wager and Smith, 2003), which con￾cludes that the superior parietal cortex is the region most com￾monly activated by tasks involving the ordering, updating, and
manipulation of items in working memory. Accordingly, among
the superior parietal lesion patients we reliably found deficits on
tests requiring exactly those cognitive operations.
A second related area of research is the use of repetitive trans￾cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to modulate working mem￾ory performance. Several studies have reported that rTMS to
PPC/SPL can affect the simple short-term retention as well as
manipulation of information in working memory (Koch et al.,
2005; Postle et al., 2006; Luber et al., 2007; Hamidi et al., 2008;
Hamidi et al., 2009). These rTMS findings differ somewhat from
our lesion findings in that tests of simple retention and recall were
affected by rTMS to SPL, but not by focal damage involving SPL.
One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the
effects of rTMS are “acute,” whereas the patients in our study
acquired their lesions several decades before behavioral testing.
Thus, it may be that although many aspects of working memory
function are supported by the SPL in the healthy brain, these
functions are differentially amenable to long-term compensatory
reorganization that can follow traumatic injury. It is also the case,
however, that caution is warranted in drawing structure–func￾tion inferences from rTMS studies, because some of the behav￾ioral effects of rTMS may result from physiological effects on
cortical regions that are distal to the region directly under the
stimulating coil. For example, in one study that recorded the EEG
while rTMS was delivered to SPL, the rTMS-related effects on the
EEG that correlated with rTMS-related changes in spatial
delayed-recognition performance were not source localized to
the SPL, but rather to cortical regions in posterior frontal cortex
and in parieto-occipital cortex (Hamidi et al., 2009). In this re￾gard it is noteworthy that whereas damage in our SPL lesion
group was largely restricted to the PPC, one might expect to find
deficits in the simple retention of information in patients with
more widespread cortical damage. The patients excluded due to
significant language impairment inform this question to some
degree. This group was characterized by widespread left hemi￾sphere damage (involving multiple cortical lobes) as well as con￾spicuously low Digit Span Forward scores (mean 4.7, SD 1.1).
This result lends qualified support to accounts of verbal working
memory positing strong links between short-term phonological
storage and receptive and/or productive components of language
(Acheson and MacDonald, 2009).
A third related area of research is the role of PPC in visuospa￾tial processing. Although we did not observe pervasive visuospa￾tial processing impairments in the SPL lesion patients, one
intriguing possibility is that the monitoring and manipulation of
information in working memory is dependent on the neural sub￾strates involved in the monitoring and manipulation of objects in
visual space. In other words, the neural systems representing
physical spatial arrangement have been adaptively co-opted to
represent the mental arrangement of information in working
memory. Consistent with this proposition are the results of at
least two functional imaging studies (LaBar et al., 1999; Knops et
al., 2009), which report that the same area of PPC can be activated
during tasks of visuospatial attention as well as during ostensibly
nonspatial tests involving working memory. Another possibility
is that superior parietal cortex plays a more general, modality￾independent role in the allocation of attention. Functional imag￾ing studies demonstrate that SPL is activated not only when
subjects are cued to shift their visual attention from one location
to another (Yantis et al., 2002; Molenberghs et al., 2007), but also
when subjects are cued to shift their auditory attention from one
location to another (Shomstein and Yantis, 2006), or their audi￾tory attention from one voice to another (Shomstein and Yantis,
2006), or their attention between visual and auditory stimuli
(Shomstein and Yantis, 2004). Perhaps the superior parietal cor￾tex is critical for certain working memory operations by virtue of
its underlying role in the flexible allocation of attention; the ma￾nipulation of information within working memory seemingly
requires rapid shifts of attention between the original stimuli and
the iteratively updated reconfigurations.
In conclusion, the present lesion study provides a causal
link between brain and behavior, demonstrating that the su￾perior parietal cortex is indeed necessary for the executive
rearrangement of information in working memory. Although
for decades the prefrontal cortex has been recognized as the de
facto “seat” of executive function, the neurological patient
results reported here indicate a prominent role for the poste￾rior parietal cortex in the mental manipulation of information
in working memory.
