Splenic steal syndrome is a controversial diagnosis of
hepatic artery hypoperfusion and may represent an under￾recognized cause of graft ischemia in the United States.1–3
Splenic steal syndrome presents nonspecifically as graft dys￾function and, if overlooked, may lead to graft failure.4,5 Its
incidence in the literature ranges widely from 0.6 to 10.1% in
liver transplant recipients2,4,6–13 with some institutions per￾forming prophylactic and/or posttransplant treatment proce￾dures in up to 22 to 26% of their transplant recipients12,13
(►Table 1). This wide disparity in the incidence of the diagno￾sis is probably because there are no objective diagnostic
imaging criteria.3 It has been proposed that the condition is
probably underrecognized in certain institutions (particularly
in the United States and Japan), and it is probably overdiag￾nosed in others (particularly in Germany and Austria).3 The
subject is being discussed in this issue of Seminars of Interven￾tional Radiology because it has a cause-and-effect relationship

Abstract There are numerous causes of reduced arterial inline flow to the liver transplant despite
a patent hepatic artery. These include causes of increased peripheral resistance in the
hepatic arterial bed, siphoning of the hepatic arterial flow by a dominant splenic artery
(splenic steal syndrome), functional reduction of hepatic arterial flow in response to
hyperdynamic portal inline flow, and small hepatic graft relative to normal portal inline
flow (relative increase of portal flow). These causes are incompletely understood, and
perhaps the most controversial of all is the splenic steal syndrome, which is possibly an
underrecognized cause of graft ischemia in the United States. Splenic steal syndrome
presents nonspecifically as graft dysfunction; if overlooked, it may lead to graft failure.
Its incidence is reported to be 0.6 to 10.1% in liver transplant recipients, with some
institutions performing prophylactic and/or posttransplant treatment procedures in up
to a quarter of their transplant recipients. This wide disparity in the incidence of the
diagnosis is probably because there are no objective diagnostic imaging criteria. This
article presents a review of the literature that addresses the differential diagnostic
considerations of hepatic artery hypoperfusion (splenic steal syndrome included) in the
absence of an anatomical defect (hepatic artery stenosis, thrombosis, and/or kinks).

on the portal hemodynamics of liver transplant recipients. This
is a review of the entire literature that addresses the differen￾tial diagnosis of hepatic artery hypoperfusion in the absence of
an anatomical defect (hepatic artery stenosis, thrombosis, and/
or kinks).
Clinical Presentation
Hepatic artery hypoperfusion, including splenic steal syn￾drome and gastroduodenal steal syndrome, in the absence of
occlusive disease of the hepatic artery usually presents in the
early posttransplant period with >80% diagnosed within
60 days of liver transplantation.3,4,6,8,11,14,15 Hepatic artery
hypoperfusion presents with nonspecific graft dysfunction as
evidenced by abnormal liver function tests.1–4,6–13,16–20 In
the later posttransplant period (after 2 months from the liver
transplant), patients may present with ascites (again, a
nonspecific finding) as an overt form of hepatic dysfunction.3
Subjective Imaging Diagnosis
Angiography is the gold standard diagnostic modality in the
evaluation of splenic steal syndrome.1,2,4,6–12 The diagnosis is
defined by sluggish flow in the hepatic artery (subjective slow
flow in the hepatic artery relative to the flow in the splenic
artery) in the absence of significant (>50% arterial diameter
reduction) arterial anatomical defects such as hepatic arterial
stenosis, thrombosis, and/or kinks1,2,4,6–12 (►Fig. 1A). How￾ever, arterial flow in the hepatic artery is usually less impres￾sive than in the splenic artery because the spleen is normally
more vascular than the liver from an arterial/arteriography
standpoint. This is because 20 to 25% of the blood flow to the
liver is arterial, and 100% of the blood flow to the spleen is
arterial. Furthermore, liver transplant recipients are com￾monly cirrhotic patients with years of underlying portal
hypertension, and, as a result, these patients have a high
likelihood of having splenomegaly at baseline.
The most objective angiographic definition was provided
by Uflacker and coworkers who only diagnosed splenic steal
syndrome when there was visualization of the hepatic artery
during the portal-venous phase of the angiogram.7 In other
words, the contrast has gone through the splenic vasculature
into the intrahepatic portal vein, “catching up” with the
contrast that is still seen in the hepatic artery. This finding
represents very slow hepatic arterial flow. This definition,
however, may set the threshold too high, to the extent that
the sensitivity of this angiographic finding is so low that
operators would be missing a potentially significant number
of splenic steal cases. By this definition, however, there may
be such a severe form of splenic steal syndrome to the extent
that there is a state of increased/hyperdynamic portal flow.
Other authors diagnosing splenic steal syndrome have not
used this threshold as a definition of splenic steal
syndrome.1,2,4,6,8–12
Other investigators have attempted to evaluate the inci￾dence of splenomegaly, and they have reported that a splenic
volume >830 cm3 has a 75% accuracy in diagnosing splenic
steal syndrome.9,12 Nominal splenic artery diameters >4 mm
and/or a splenic artery to hepatic artery diameter ratio >1.5
are also considered significant indicators of splenic steal
syndrome.9,12 However, as mentioned earlier, most trans￾plant patients have had chronic cirrhosis prior to their
transplantation, and therefore splenomegaly and splenomeg￾aly-related findings are not uncommon.3 These, in my opin￾ion, are probably secondary/supporting findings and do not
make the diagnosis.
Doppler ultrasound findings are not specific and are not
commonly or consistently described in reported splenic steal
syndrome cases.5,11,14,21 In fact, of 12 studies reporting 113
arterial steal cases in liver transplant recipients, only 34 (30%)
of cases had descriptions of Doppler findings.3–9,11,13,14,22
The most commonly described Doppler finding is an abnor￾mally high arterial resistive index (RI: >0.80).5,7,11,13,14,21,22
Actual arterial velocities are rarely reported.3,22,23

Commonly, when Doppler parameters are mentioned, the
arterial RI of the hepatic artery is 1.00 due to reversed end
diastolic volume.13,21,22 However, transiently high RI in the
early postoperative period, when most splenic steal cases are
diagnosed, is not uncommon, although its pathogenesis is not
understood. One explanation for the transiently high arterial
RIs in the early postoperative period is increased resistance in
the peripheral hepatic arterial vasculature.11,21,24
In cases of splenic steal syndrome, portal vein velocities are
sporadically reported. When reported, portal vein velocities
have been valued at >50 cm/second and may be up to
150 cm/second.5,13,14 However, portal vein velocities have
also been reported as low as 13 to 37 cm/second in the setting
of splenic steal syndrome.12,23,25 An interesting and invari￾able Doppler ultrasound phenomenon, when mentioned, is
the response of the Doppler parameters to splenic emboliza￾tion. In this setting, the hepatic arterial RI decreases from that
seen pre-embolization, as well as an increase in the hepatic
arterial velocities and a decrease in the portal venous
velocites.3,5,13,14
Pathogenesis and Hemodynamics of Hepatic
Artery Hypoperfusion in Liver Transplant
Recipients
One cannot attempt to discuss the diagnosis splenic steal
syndrome without discussing the hemodynamics of the
splanchnic vasculature and the various hypotheses behind
the cause of splenic steal syndrome.3 Unfortunately, splanch￾nic hemodynamics are not fully understood, adding to the
difficulty in making this diagnosis and provoking a contro￾versy regarding the exact cause of the hepatic artery hypo￾perfusion in splenic steal syndrome. Initially when it was first
described (1990), splenic steal syndrome was considered a
true arterial flow problem with flow preferentially going to
the splenic artery and being diverted away from the hepatic
artery (a true steal phenomenon), hence the name of the
syndrome.16–18,26 However, in 2008 it was proposed that the
hepatic arterial hypoperfusion is in response to portal venous
hyperperfusion, mediated by the hepatic arterial buffer re￾sponse (HABR).13,27 Quintini and coworkers made a very
important observation, which is that these patients have
high portal venous flow represented by a increased portal
vein velocity (the presumption is that portal vein diameter
remains the same).13 These investigators were rather dog￾matic about the sole causal relationship between portal
hyperperfusion and hepatic artery hypoperfusion leading
to splenic steal syndrome.13 However, the hypothesis of
portal hyperperfusion as the sole etiology of “splenic steal
syndrome” was challenged by Saad.3 From a scientific stand￾point, making a finding that correlates well with a disease
process does not confirm causality, especially in such a
complex and poorly understood hemodynamic setting.3
The finding of high portal venous velocity/flow could be a
secondary effect or contributing factor and not necessarily the
cause. I do agree with Quintini and coworkers, however, that
adequate response by occluding the splenic artery does not
necessarily support the steal theory over the portal hyper￾perfusion theory because embolizing the splenic artery does
also reduce the portal venous flow.3,11,13
In the previous report, I explained there are two subsets of
this broader hypoperfusion “steal” phenomenon that were
overlooked and do not fit with the theory suggested by
Quintini and coworkers3,13 (►Figs. 2 and 3). First is the
gastroduodenal artery (GDA) steal cases. GDA steal is a
recognized steal phenomenon similar to splenic steal, which
represents up to 18% of steal cases in liver transplant recip￾ients.4,8,11,16,19 I doubt that embolizing the GDA has a signifi￾cant effect on the portal venous flow.3 This challenges the
explanation that splenic steal syndrome is just a portal
venous hyperperfusion phenomenon.3 Moreover, Nishida
and coworkers described a GDA steal case with pre- and
Figure 1 Middle-age woman status post–liver transplantation
3 months previously, presenting with abnormal liver function tests
(dysfunctional graft). Liver biopsy was suggestive of ischemia.

recipient demonstrating delayed arterial flow (open arrow) in the
hepatic artery with no peripheral filling of the hepatic arterial distri￾bution at this stage of the angiogram. In contrast, the splenic artery is
filling peripherally into the spleen (Sp). (B) Selective image from a
celiac angiogram of the same liver transplant recipient after balloon￾test occlusion (asterisk) of the proximal splenic artery. This is the same
catheter positioning, injection rate and volume, and frame within the
angiogram as (A). The distal splenic artery (open arrows) is filling
distally via reconstitution via the left gastroepiploic (LGA-PA) and left
gastric arteries (LGAs) and continues to supply the spleen (Sp). In
contrast with (A), obtained before the temporary splenic artery
occlusion, the peripheral hepatic arterial branches are now filling in
normal fashion.

post-GDA ligation in which they described arterial Doppler
ultrasound measurements (unfortunately, the portal vein
velocity was not disclosed).22 From pre- to post-GDA ligation,
the peak hepatic arterial systolic velocity increased from 13 to
79 cm/second, the end diastolic velocity increased from zero
to 23 cm/second, the mean arterial velocity increased from 4
to 49 cm/second, and the arterial RI decreased from 1.0 to
0.71.22 These findings mirror those of studies describing
Doppler findings post–splenic artery embolization for splenic
steal syndrome.5,13,14
The second aspect that does not fit the Quintini hyper￾perfusion theory is that arterial steal phenomena (GDA and/
or splenic) do not occur in liver transplant recipients with
direct aorto-hepatic conduits.1,11 In fact, aorto-hepatic con￾duits are a treatment of posttransplant arterial steal.6,7,17,21 If
the arterial hypoperfusion is in response to the portal hyper￾perfusion, then the arterial flow in the conduit should also
respond in like fashion (unless one speculates that a conduit
makes the hepatic artery less denervated and/or makes the
hepatic artery “extra-splanchnic”).3 Conversely, the HABR is
accepted to be an intrinsic intrahepatic mediator due to
intrahepatic adenosine washout by the hyperdynamic portal
circulation.28–32 Adenosine is a known vasodilator that natu￾rally accumulates in the liver and helps regulate hepatic
arterial flow. When portal flow increases, the influx of portal
venous flow washes the adenosine out of the hepatic
vascular bed ridding the hepatic arterial flow of this vasodi￾lator, thereby causing a relative hepatic artery
vasoconstriction.28–32
Saad added that Quintini and coworkers are not necessari￾ly wrong (they may very well be partly correct), but merely
that they have no proof of causality and that their important
finding does not fit all “arterial steal scenarios.” There may be
several causes/types of scenarios with multiple predisposing
factors and/or precipitators.3 Unfortunately, there are so
many variables affecting the splanchnic circulation that it is
impossible at this time to make any assertion as to the cause
(s) of splenic steal syndrome/subjective hepatic artery
hypoperfusion.3
The complexity of the governing hemodynamics of the
splanchnic circulation can be simplified if explained in a fluid￾mechanics manner. ►Figs. 2 and 3 help demonstrate the
numerous variables that can affect hepatic arterial inflow.
Simply, it is a partly reciprocal relationship between two
arterial components in balance, and two venous components
that are relative to one another. The arterial and venous
components are intertwined/mediated by the partly recipro￾cal HABR. Unfortunately, the details of what is known and
what is hypothesized about the HABR is beyond the scope of
this article.28–32 The partly reciprocal relationship between
the hepatic arterial inflow and the hepatic portal venous
inflow is simplified in ►Fig. 4.
28–32
From the arterial standpoint, there is a hypothetical bal￾ance between the resistance of the splenic arterial bed and
the resistance of the hepatic arterial bed. A low resistant
splenic bed relative to a higher resistant hepatic bed would
favor flow toward the spleen (splenic steal). This has been
partly proposed by prior authors, where they proposed that
causes of increased hepatic arterial resistance may aggravate
the splenic steal condition.1,2,4,7,8,21,22 These posttransplant
conditions include preservation injury, stiff graft (poorly
compliant graft), postoperative edema, large subcapsular
hematoma, graft rejection, and abdominal compartment
syndrome.1,2,4,7,8,21,22 Rarely have prior authors included
significant hepatic arterial stenosis (>50% diameter reduc￾tion) as a superadded condition causing increased hepatic

full circle between the celiac axis (CAx), the spleen, the splenic vein,
the portal vein, and the liver. To complete the circle is the mediation
of the portal venous inflow with the hepatic arterial inflow of the liver
by the hepatic artery buffer response (HABR).

hemodynamic balances between the splenic peripheral vascular re￾sistance (splenic vasc. bed) and the hepatic peripheral vascular resis￾tance (hepatic vasc. bed) on the arterial side of the splanchnic
circulation. On the portovenous side of the splanchnic circulation,
there is a balance between the graft size (and graft quality) and the
portal venous flow itself. Mediation between the arterial (top half of
schematic) and the venous (bottom half of schematic) circulation is by
the hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR), which is a partly reciprocal
relationship between the hepatic arterial and hepatic portovenous
inflow (Fig. 4).

arterial resistance and thus accentuating splenic steal syn￾drome.4 As do most authors, I consider splenic steal syn￾drome and hemodynamically significant hepatic arterial
stenosis as mutually exclusive.1,21,22 In other words, one
cannot diagnose splenic steal syndrome in the presence of
a significant hepatic arterial stenosis, kink, or hepatic artery
thrombosis.1,3,21,22
From the portal venous standpoint, there is a hypothetical
balance of relativity between the portal venous inflow to the
hepatic graft and the size of the graft itself.3 The problem can
be an undersized graft (and/or poor graft quality), portal
venous hyperperfusion, or both.3 The relative portal venous
hyperperfusion, irrespective of the cause, would induce a
reduction in the hepatic arterial inflow mediated by the HABR
(washout of adenosine and its vasodilator effect). Again, this
has been partly proposed by prior authors.11,13,33–36 Mogl
and coworkers proposed that a known problem in split grafts
that are undersized (small-for-size-syndrome), where there
is relative portal venous hyperperfusion, may induce arterial
hypoperfusion mediated by the HABR.11 Mogl and coworkers
speculated that this phenomenon may exist in whole grafts
where the portal inflow is relatively higher than the whole
graft size.11
As can be concluded from the previous discussion and
delineated by the illustration in ►Fig. 3, all these variables are
relative to one another, and the clinical descriptions and
associations in the literature are fragmented.3 No one study
has delineated causality.3 However, this problem, with all its
Figure 4 Simplified schematic of the hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR), which is a partly reciprocal relationship between the hepatic arterial
and hepatic portovenous inflow. This relationship is incompletely understood in both native livers and after liver transplantation. The HABR is
speculated to be altered in the relatively denervated transplant hepatic graft, but in what way and to what extent, if any, is unknown. At baseline
(normal, top row), 30% of the hepatic arterial inline flow shunts to the portal circulation. The middle rows shows the largely agreed-upon arterial
and portal responses. The response specific to nonocclusive hepatic artery hypoperfusion syndrome or splenic steal syndrome is an increase in
inline portal venous flow (hyperdynamic portal circulation), causing a hepatic arterial response with a concomitant reduction of inline arterial flow
and a reduction of the hepatic artery-to-portal shunting (more than the normally expected 30% of hepatic arterial flow). The HABR may be
mediated by adenosine washout. Adenosine, a known vasodilator, accumulates in the liver. When inline portal venous flow increases, it washes out
the adenosine and its vasodilator effect, leading to vasoconstriction, an increase in peripheral arterial resistance, and diminished hepatic arterial
flow.

relative variables, was discussed globally by Saad regarding
arterial complications after liver transplantation.3 He specu￾lated that splenic steal syndrome may have several causes
and, if certain causes predominate, there may be several
types.3 Furthermore, in his speculation, there may be predis￾posing factors such as splenomegaly relative to hepatic graft
size with a dual hypoperfusion effect (due to the splenomeg￾aly) on the hepatic artery. This work led to a true arterial steal
and HABR-mediated response precipitated or accentuated by
increased peripheral arterial resistance and/or GDA steal.3
Moreover, there may be degrees of severity of this or these
hypoperfusion phenomena.3 Saad did agree, however, with
Quintini and coworkers that “splenic artery steal syndrome”
may be a misleading name because we are not sure whether it
is actually a steal (siphon) phenomenon in all cases or in none
at all.3 Saad proposed a new name based on what is known:
posttransplant “non-occlusive hepatic artery hypoperfusion
syndrome” (NOHAH syndrome), allowing all the potential
and relative hypothetical causes to be included without a
commitment to a particular concomitant finding, cause,
predisposing/precipitating factors, and/or type.3
Splenic artery occlusion by embolization, banding, or
surgical ligation has been proven to resolve the hypoperfu￾sion syndrome.4,7,11,19,21 However, this is not proof that the
hypoperfusion syndrome (NOHAH syndrome) is a true steal
phenomenon.3 As can be seen in ►Figs. 2 and 3, the governing
relationships create a full circle linked by the HABR. Breaking
this circle (by occluding the splenic artery) reverses the
hepatic artery hypoperfusion.3
Management
Management of nonocclusive hepatic artery hypoperfusion
syndrome is to attempt to identify the problem(s) and treat
them.3 Careful evaluation of the celiac angiogram to look for
underlying anatomical defects (hepatic artery stenosis,
thrombosis, and/or kinks) is the first step.1,3 Tomogram
rotational angiography may aid in identifying anatomical
defects, particularly in tortuous projection-overlapping arte￾rial anatomy.3 Allograft rejection should be diagnosed by
biopsy, immune-suppressant serum values, clinical suspicion,
and should be managed medically.3 Large subcapsular hema￾tomas should be evacuated or percutaneously decompressed.
Abdominal compartment syndrome should be relieved by
celiotomy. Unfortunately, other causes of increased hepatic
arterial peripheral resistance are not easy to diagnose and
manage.1,3 In cases of gastroduodenal (GDA) steal syndrome,
a lateral aortogram evaluating for a significant superior
mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis is required, with resolution
of the SMA stenosis with angioplasty/stent placement or
arcuate ligament release with or without GDA embolization.1
If there is preferential flow to the splenic artery, and if
surgically feasible, an aortohepatic conduit can be created,
taking the spleen out of the equation by ridding the common
origin of the hepatic and splenic arteries.6,7,17,21 A more
common alternative, if there is preferential flow to the splenic
artery, are methods to restrict flow to the spleen1,2,4,6–13
(►Fig. 1). These include splenic artery banding, ligation,
hourglass stents, and embolization.1,2,4,6–13 Splenic artery
ligation or banding are usually resorted to as prophylactic
measures, although they can be utilized if the diagnosis is
made posttransplant.12,13 Splenic artery embolization is the
predominant method for reducing the preferential flow to the
splenic artery and thus redirecting flow to the posttransplant
hepatic artery as well as decreasing the hyperdynamic portal
flow.1,2,4,6–13,16–20 The technical results are excellent
(►Fig. 1), and the risk of splenic infarction is minimized
by embolizing the splenic artery proximally
(►Fig. 1B).1,2,4,6–13,16–20 There are currently no clearly de￾scribed objective definitions to define clinical
success.1,2,4,6–13,16–20
If hepatic artery hypoperfusion is suspected along with
hypersplenism (large spleen in the presence of pancytopenia,
especially thrombocytopenia), graduated particulate distal
splenic artery embolization can be performed to reduce the
size of the spleen; this would also help with the NOHAH
syndrome.3 This particulate embolization would utilize stan￾dard microcatheter techniques and embolic materials that
may include polyvinyl alcohol, Gelfoam (Upjohn, Inc., Kala￾mazoo, MI), or other commercially available bland particulate
embolic products. Usually two to three sessions are required
to help sufficiently reduce the splenic volume with a de￾creased risk of splenic infarction and abscess formation.
Approximately 30 to 40% of the spleen is devascularized
each session.1,3 However, this technique may take time
(months) to reach the desired effect from a splenic steal
standpoint. It is effective, however, for hypersplenism (which
is a matter of less urgency).3 Details of partial spleen emboli￾zation and outcomes are discussed elsewhere in this issue.
Conclusion
Hepatic artery hypoperfusion in the absence of significant
hepatic artery stenosis, thrombosis, or kinks may have multiple
well-described causes that are interrelated and may coexist.
The complexity of splanchnic hemodynamics, the numerous
variables associated with liver transplantation, and the lack of
objective diagnostic imaging criteria make it difficult to identify
the cause(s) and further fuel the controversy regarding the
diagnosis of splenic steal syndrome. Saad has proposed that the
global hepatic artery hypoperfusion be renamed NOHAH and
not after a particular cause or partial cause that is defined in
splenic steal syndrome.3 Regardless of the causes, splenic
embolization breaks the splenic-to-portal circulation and has
been shown to improve hepatic arterial flow.
