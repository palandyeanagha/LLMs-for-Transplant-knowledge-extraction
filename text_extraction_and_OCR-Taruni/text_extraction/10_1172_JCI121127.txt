BACKGROUND. Adoptive transfer of donor-derived EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs) can eradicate EBV￾associated lymphomas (EBV-PTLD) after transplantation of hematopoietic cell (HCT) or solid organ (SOT) but is unavailable 
for most patients.
METHODS. We developed a third-party, allogeneic, off-the-shelf bank of 330 GMP-grade EBV-CTL lines from specifically 
consented healthy HCT donors. We treated 46 recipients of HCT (n = 33) or SOT (n = 13) with established EBV-PTLD, who 
had failed rituximab therapy, with third-party EBV-CTLs. Treatment cycles consisted of 3 weekly infusions of EBV-CTLs and 
3 weeks of observation.
RESULTS. EBV-CTLs did not induce significant toxicities. One patient developed grade I skin graft-versus-host disease. 
Complete remission (CR) or sustained partial remission (PR) was achieved in 68% of HCT recipients and 54% of SOT 
recipients. For patients who achieved CR/PR or stable disease after cycle 1, one year overall survival was 88.9% and 
81.8%, respectively. In addition, 3 of 5 recipients with POD after a first cycle who received EBV-CTLs from a different 
donor achieved CR or durable PR (60%) and survived longer than 1 year. Maximal responses were achieved after a 
median of 2 cycles.
CONCLUSION. Third-party EBV-CTLs of defined HLA restriction provide safe, immediately accessible treatment for EBV-PTLD. 
Secondary treatment with EBV-CTLs restricted by a different HLA allele (switch therapy) can also induce remissions if initial 
EBV-CTLs are ineffective. These results suggest a promising potential therapy for patients with rituximab-refractory EBV￾associated lymphoma after transplantation.
TRIAL REGISTRATION. Phase II protocols (NCT01498484 and NCT00002663) were approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the FDA, and the National Marrow Donor Program.

Here, we report a single-center cohort of 46 patients with rit￾uximab-refractory lymphomas developing after HCT or SOT who 
were treated with banked third-party EBV-CTL lines between Octo￾ber 2005 and May 2015, and describe attributes of the disease, its 
prior treatment, and the T cells used for adoptive therapy that are 
associated with clearance or continued progression of disease.
Results
Patient characteristics
Characteristics of the 46 patients and their clinical and radiologic 
manifestations of EBV disease prior to treatment with EBV￾CTLs are described in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 (supplemental 
material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/
JCI121127DS1) and summarized in Table 2. These patients had 
either progressed during rituximab treatment, failed to fully 
respond to it, or had a recurrence after a prior response. Prior 
therapy for 8 of 33 HCT patients and 12 of 13 SOT patients also 
included chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. One of the HCT 
patients had failed to respond to EBV-CTLs from his HLA-dispa￾rate transplant donor. At time of referral, 27 of 33 HCT and 12 of 
13 SOT recipients had high-risk disease based on location (≥3 of 7 
anatomical sites of involvement and/or extranodal disease) (10).
Pathologic characteristics of EBV malignancies
Histopathologic and genetic features of the EBV-associated lym￾phomas are described in Supplemental Table 3. The lymphomas 
were all of B cell type, and were monomorphic diffuse large B cell 
lymphomas in 24 of 30 HCT recipients (80%) and 8 of 13 SOT 
recipients (62%).
In HCT recipients the malignancy was monoclonal in 16 of 21 
patients adequately tested and of transplant donor origin in 12 of 
14 patients, including 1 with lymphoma cells from both cord blood 
units following double cord blood transplantation (CBT). In SOT 
recipients, 7 of 7 lymphomas tested were of host origin.
Characterization of EBV-CTLs infused
As shown in Figure 1, the EBV-CTLs contained more than 95% 
CD3+
 T cells and fewer than 1% NK cells. Most EBV-CTL lines 
contained more than 90% CD8+
 T cells. However, 7 CTL lines con￾tained more than 50% CD4+
 T cells. All T cell lines demonstrated 
EBV-specific cytotoxic activity. In limiting dilution assays, the 
EBV-CTLs contained a median of 6323.5 EBV-specific cytotoxic 
T cell precursors (EBV-CTLps) (range, 2.5–76,982 EBV-CTLps 
per 106 cells), and, in response to irradiated fully allogeneic 
PBMCs, generated low or undetectable alloreactive CTLps (medi￾an 1.2, range 0–27.4 allo-CTLps per 106 cells). EBV-CTLs admin￾istered to HCT patients did not differ significantly from those 
administered to SOT patients, either in types of T cells adminis￾tered or in their frequencies of EBV-CTLps (data not shown).
HLA restrictions were identified for each of the 55 EBV-CTL 
lines used; 19 (34%) were restricted by a single HLA-A (n = 15), 
HLA-B (n = 3), or HLA-DR (n = 1) allele, 26 lines (47%) by 2 (n = 13) 
or 3 (n = 13) alleles, and 10 (18%) by 4 or more alleles.
As might be expected, the EBV-CTL lines selected were 
most commonly restricted by class I HLA alleles prevalent in 
the ethnically diverse population of the New York area, such 
Introduction
EBV-induced lymphomas are a significant cause of morbidi￾ty and mortality for recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplants (HCTs) and solid organ transplants (SOTs) (1–5). 
While decreasing immunosuppression can induce remissions of 
EBV-associated post-transplantation lymphoproliferative dis￾order (EBV-PTLD) in recipients of SOT with benign polyclonal 
lymphoid hyperplasias (5), it is not effective in HCT recipients or 
in SOT recipients who present with monoclonal/monomorphic 
lymphoma (5). Although combination chemotherapy can induce 
remissions in 40%–50% of SOT patients with monoclonal dis￾ease, relapses are common (6, 7). Furthermore, treatment-related 
mortality after R-CHOP ranges from 6% to 30%. In HCT patients, 
combination chemotherapy is associated with increased morbid￾ity and mortality (8). Rituximab, administered preemptively, can 
induce sustained reversal of EBV viremia in up to 83% of HCT 
recipients (9); but only 50%–60% of patients with clinically and 
radiologically established disease achieve remissions (10–12).
In 1994, our group reported 5 HCT patients with monoclonal 
EBV-associated lymphomas who achieved complete remission 
(CR) after infusion of lymphocytes (donor lymphocyte infusion 
[DLI]) from their EBV-seropositive transplant donors and cor￾related response with emergence of donor-derived EBV-CTLs 
in the blood after transfer (13, 14). In 1995, Rooney et al. (15) 
first used HCT donor–derived EBV-specific cytotoxic T lym￾phocytes (EBV-CTLs) generated in vitro to treat or prevent EBV 
lymphomas following HCT without graft-versus-host disease 
(GvHD) (16). Subsequently, small case series have confirmed 
that HCT donor–derived EBV-CTLs can induce clearance of 
viremia and durable CRs of EBV+ lymphomas in 50%–70% of 
cases (17–21). In SOT patients, autologous EBV-CTLs can also 
induce CR or transient partial remissions (PRs) of EBV lympho￾mas (22–25). However, EBV viremia is rarely cleared (23, 25–27). 
Furthermore, autologous EBV-CTLs are difficult to generate if 
the SOT recipient (a) is seronegative or (b) has received ritux￾imab. For both HCT and SOT recipients, logistics and culture 
times required to generate EBV-CTLs in time to treat these rap￾idly progressive lymphomas have been prohibitive.
To provide rapid access, we and others have explored partially 
HLA-matched EBV-CTLs derived from healthy donors other than 
the transplant donor (i.e., third-party donors). In 2002, Haque 
et al. (28) first reported the use of such cells in the treatment of 
8 SOT recipients with EBV-PTLD, including one with lymphoma 
who achieved a PR. They then (29) treated 31 SOT and 2 HCT 
recipients with EBV-PTLD, of whom 14 (including 2 HCT patients) 
achieved CR and 3 PR. Subsequently, we reported 5 patients 
with EBV+
 lymphomas complicating allogeneic cord blood or T 
cell–depleted HCT grafts whom we treated with partially HLA￾matched third-party EBV-CTLs selected for restriction by an HLA 
allele shared by the allogenic HCT donor and/or the patient’s 
disease. Of these, 4 achieved durable CR (17, 30). Subsequently, 
limited case series have used third-party EBV-specific or multi￾virus-specific T cells to treat EBV-associated lymphoproliferative 
disorder (EBV-LPD) or EBV viremia complicating cord blood or 
marrow HCTs, SOTs, or genetic immune deficiencies (29–39) 
(summarized in Table 1). However, the number of patients treated 
for EBV+
 lymphoma is small.

achieved durable PRs (CR + PR = 54%). In all, 29 of the 45 evalu￾able patients (64%) achieved a CR or sustained PR. The overall sur￾vival at 2 years was 57% for HCT and 54% for SOT recipients (Fig￾ure 2C). Both the complete and, strikingly, the partial remissions in 
the HCT and SOT groups have been durable (6–115 months).
Outcomes based on EBV-CTLs administered are summa￾rized in Figure 3. Twenty-one patients received a single cycle 
of EBV-CTLs, of whom 8 (7 HCT, 1 SOT) achieved a CR and 1 
a durable PR (>2.5 years). However, 11 of 21 patients had POD 
as HLA-A*0201, -B*0702, -A*0301, and -B*0801. On the basis 
of the HLA restrictions of the EBV-CTL lines in our bank, and 
the HLA alleles inherited by over 400 patients referred for 
transplantation, we estimate that a bank including EBV-CTLs 
restricted by 40 HLA alleles would be able to provide suitably 
restricted EBV-CTLs for over 95% of this population.
Treatment with third-party–derived EBV-CTLs is well tolerated
No immediate adverse reactions were observed due to infusion of 
EBV-CTLs. One patient developed de novo grade I acute GvHD 
of the skin, which resolved with topical therapy; none of the 19 
patients with prior GvHD required additional therapy for GvHD 
after EBV-CTL therapy. No patient experienced CTL-related de 
novo suppression of neutrophil, red cell, or platelet counts or, in 
SOT patients, evidence of organ rejection.
Clinical responses of EBV-associated lymphomas to third-party EBV￾CTL infusions
Responses to treatment with EBV-CTLs were classified as CR, 
partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), or progression of dis￾ease (POD) using the International Workshop Criteria for assess￾ing response to treatment in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (40). Only 
8 of 33 HCT and 1 of 13 SOT patients achieved a CR after the first 
cycle of EBV-CTLs (Table 3 and Figure 2). An additional 9 patients 
(7 HCT, 2 SOT) achieved a PR. Thus, the response (CR + PR) after 
cycle 1 was 39% (18/46). However, as shown in Table 3 and Figure 
2, response rates (CR + PR) increased with additional cycles, with 
maximal response achieved after a median of 2 cycles (range, 1–5). 
Of 33 HCT patients, 19 ultimately achieved a CR and 3 a stable 
PR (CR + PR = 68%). Of 13 SOT patients, 2 achieved a CR and 5

occurred within 8.8 months following initiation of T cell therapy in 
HCT and 5.8 months in SOT recipients.
For the 18 patients who achieved a CR or PR following the 
first cycle, survival at 2 years was 83%, and equivalent wheth￾er they did or did not receive a second cycle. As shown in Fig￾ure 4C, of those with SD after cycle 1 who received subsequent 
cycles, 72% were surviving at 2 years. In patients with POD 
following cycle 1 who received subsequent cycles of EBV-CTLs 
from a different donor, 3 of 5 (60%) responded and survived 
free of EBV+ lymphoma 2 years later.
In patients who achieved CR or PR, clinical improvements, 
including defervescence, shrinkage of palpable nodes, reduction 
of organomegaly, and resolution of pain or intestinal bleeding, 
were first detected 8–15 days after infusion of the effective T cells. 
Improvements in radiologic/endoscopic findings were document￾ed by 28–35 days after the start of therapy. In patients with SD, 
symptoms including pain and fever plateaued or improved, but 
radiographic abnormalities did not improve. In contrast, patients 
who failed to respond showed persistence of fever and other clin￾ical symptoms with continued clinical deterioration and/or wors￾ening of radiologic findings.
In responding patients who had detectable EBV DNA levels in 
the blood before T cell infusion, 2 log10 reductions of EBV DNA levels 
were a useful initial indicator of response. However, because of prior 
through the first cycle, of whom 9 died early of EBV+
 lymphoma. 
Median survival was 32 days (10–62 days) from initiation of EBV￾CTLs. One additional patient with POD died of sepsis during the 
evaluation period; one patient received an alternate therapy and 
responded but died 12.1 months later of GvHD that predated EBV 
cell therapy. One other patient relapsed with his primary leukemia 
1 day after his third dose of EBV-CTLs. This patient could be eval￾uated for toxicity and overall survival, but not for EBV lymphoma 
response because of chemotherapy introduced to treat the leuke￾mia. This patient achieved remission of both EBV lymphoma and 
leukemia. However, leukemia relapsed 1 year after treatment; this 
patient died of leukemia 3 months later.
Of the 25 patients who received more than 1 cycle of EBV-CTLs, 
16 (1 CR, 6 PR, 8 SD, 1 nonevaluable) received EBV-CTLs from the 
same EBV-CTL line, with 9 ultimately achieving a CR and 5 a PR.
Three patients (1 PR, 1 SD, 1 POD) received subsequent cycles of 
EBV-CTLs from a different donor, but restricted by the same shared 
HLA allele as the primary cycle of cells; all achieved a CR. The 
patient with POD (UPN 4234) received a second HLA-B*07:02–
restricted EBV-CTL line recognizing epitopes from both EBNA3C 
and EBNA3A rather than EBNA3A alone (data not shown).
Six patients (1 PR, 1 SD, 4 POD) received switch therapy with 
secondary cycles of EBV-CTLs restricted by a different HLA allele. 
Based on prior analyses of EBV+
 lymphoma cells isolated from 
nonresponding patients (17, 41), we reasoned that switching to 
EBV-CTLs specific for an epitope presented by a different shared 
HLA allele might better treat an EBV lymphoma that was initial￾ly resistant. Of these 6, 1 with POD achieved a CR, 1 with POD 
achieved a PR, 1 in PR continued in PR until starting alternative 
therapy 4.9 months later, and 1 remained with SD. The other 2 
patients continued with POD. However, progression was slowed, 
with survival extended to 215 and 266 days, respectively.
As shown in Figure 4A, most patients with continued pro￾gression of lymphoma died within a month of completing the first 
cycle, reflecting the rapid course of disease if not checked early 
in progression. Cumulative risk of death due to EBV lymphoma 
was 26% (Figure 4B). All deaths attributable to EBV lymphoma

3 sites of disease (80%) (P = 0.06). Patients with extranodal sites of 
lymphoma also had a lower response rate (P = 0.008). Patients treat￾ed with rituximab and chemotherapy before EBV-CTLs also fared 
worse than those previously treated with rituximab alone (45% vs. 
80%, P = 0.03). In this series, no significant differences in response 
were seen when EBV-CTLs were administered to patients receiving 
concomitant steroid therapy. However, no patient was receiving a 
dose of ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisone or its equivalent. Of those receiving
≥0.2 mg/kg/d prednisone or its equivalent, 4 of 7 (57%) responded, 
compared with 7 of 12 (58%) patients receiving less than 0.2 mg/kg 
and 18 of 26 (69%) receiving no steroids.

Clinical and immunologic variables affecting outcome
Clinical characteristics of patients associated with response. The patient 
characteristics examined for an association with response are sum￾marized in Table 4. All sites of involvement, including the CNS, 
responded to EBV-CTL therapy. Of 11 patients with evidence of 
CNS involvement, 5 achieved CR and 4 durable PR. The proportion 
of patients with multiple sites of disease who achieved a CR or PR 
(52%) was significantly lower than that of patients with fewer than

With subsequent cycles of EBV-CTLs the response rate increased to 22 of 33 HCT (68%) and 7 of 13 SOT (54%) recipients. (C) Kaplan-Meier probabilities of

As shown in Table 5, the overall response rates (CR + PR) 
among recipients of unmodified and T cell–depleted HCT were 
similar (70% and 75%, respectively) and only slightly higher than 
that observed in cord blood graft recipients (60%). Complete 
response rates were similar (60%, 58%, and 60% for unmodified, 
T cell–depleted, and cord blood grafts). Notably, levels of CD3+
and CD3+
CD4+
 T cells and responses to phytohemagglutinin 
(PHA) were also similar in the 3 HCT groups.
Although the overall rate of durable responses (CR + PR) did 
not differ significantly between HCT and SOT recipients, the CR 
rate was higher in HCT patients than in SOT recipients (58% vs. 
15%, P = 0.007). Since we would expect EBV-CTLs to be more sus￾ceptible to rejection in patients with residual T cell function, we 
examined whether differences in endogenous T cell populations 
in HCT and SOT recipients might be correlated with differences in 
CR rates observed. As shown in Table 5, the numbers of CD4+
 and 
CD8+
 T cells or T cell responses to PHA prior to adoptive therapy

were significantly lower than those of the SOT recipients, reflect￾ing their greater degree of T cell deficiency prior to treatment.
Characteristics of EBV-CTLs and in vivo EBV-CTL proliferation 
after transfer associated with response. As also shown in Table 4, 
lines used to treat patients who did or did not achieve a CR or PR 
did not differ significantly in the dose of EBV-specific CTLps per 
kilogram administered (P = 0.94). The distribution of CD4+
 and 
CD8+
 T cells among the EBV-CTLs administered was also simi￾lar, with a median of 11% CD4+
 T cells among EBV-CTLs admin￾istered to patients achieving a CR or PR, compared with 9% in 
patients who failed to respond (P = 0.58).
The degree of HLA matching between EBV-CTLs adminis￾tered and the HCT donor and patient or the SOT patient was not 
correlated with response (Table 4). Overall, the EBV-CTLs were 
matched with the patient and, for HCT, the transplant donor at 
a median of 4 of 10 alleles. A CR or PR was achieved in 12 of 19 
(63%) patients matched for 1–3 HLA alleles and 17 of 26 (65%) 
matched for 4–8 alleles (P = 0.99). Results were similar for patient 
groups analyzed by transplant type. We also used the Cochran￾Armitage test to identify any trends in compatibility associated 
with response. Again, no significant relationship was observed 
(P = 0.52). EBV lymphomas emerging in HCT recipients were of 
transplant donor type in 12 of 14 cases. However, we also found no 
significant trend in response between the number of HLA alleles 
shared by the EBV-CTLs and the HCT donor (P = 0.98).
We also examined correlations between responses and the 
number of HLA restrictions shared by the patient (for SOT and HCT 
recipients) and/or the transplant donor (for HCT recipients). As 
shown in Table 6, in response to the EBV-CTLs initially transferred, 
11 of 31 evaluable patients (35%) who received EBV-CTLs restricted 
by a single shared HLA allele achieved a CR or PR, and 6 patients 
achieved SD. In comparison, 7 of 13 patients (54%) treated with 
EBV-CTLs restricted by at least 2 shared alleles achieved a CR or 
PR, and 1 had SD. Ultimately, however, 21 of 31 patients treated with 
EBV-CTLs restricted by a single shared HLA allele (68%) achieved 
a CR or durable PR, compared with 8 of 14 patients (57%) treated 
with EBV-CTLs restricted by at least 2 shared alleles (P = 0.5).
We also examined the potential influence of HLA restrictions 
on the results observed in different patients receiving the same 
EBV-CTL line. In this series, EBV-CTL lines from 7 donors were 
used to treat more than 1 patient: 4 lines were used in 3 patients 
apiece, 2 in 2 patients, and 1 in 7 patients. The response rate among 
recipients of these lines did not differ significantly from the over￾all response rates in 10 of 14 HCT recipients (71%) and 5 of 8 SOT 
recipients (62%). Of the 7 donor lines, 5 had more than 1 restrict￾ing HLA allele. Among 12 recipients of these 5 lines, 3 shared 
only 1 of the EBV-CTLs’ restricting HLA alleles, of whom only 1 
responded. In contrast, 8 of 9 recipients inheriting more than 1 of 
the EBV-CTLs’ restricting alleles responded.
Taken together, these data suggest that while restriction of the 
EBV-CTLs by a single shared HLA allele is sufficient, there may be 
an advantage to selection of EBV-CTLs restricted by more than 1 
HLA allele shared by the patient’s disease. In this limited series, we 
did not detect an association between administration of EBV-CT￾Ls restricted by any specific HLA allele and clinical response.
Although the characteristics of the EBV-CTLs analyzed 
did not predict response, EBV-CTLs that induced a CR or PR 
were regularly associated with a marked increase in blood lev￾Table 5. Baseline immune phenotype, function, and transplant type in responders and nonresponders

restricted by 1 HLA allele but subsequently responded to EBV-CTLs 
restricted by a different shared HLA allele. This is exemplified by 
patient UPN 5597 (Figure 6), who presented with a host-derived 
EBV+
 lymphoma and had POD after treatment with 3 separate EBV￾CTL lines restricted by HLA-A*11:01, including 2 lines that had pre￾viously induced a CR or PR in other patients (lines A and B). During 
these cycles, increases in CTLp frequencies were not observed 
(Figure 6B). He was then switched to an EBV-CTL line restricted by 
another shared allele, HLA-B*44:03 (line D). This line induced a CR, 
associated with a marked increment in CTLp frequencies.
Subsequently, as shown in Table 7, we found that the HLA￾A*11:01–restricted EBV-CTL lines failed to lyse the HLA-A*11:01+
EBV+
 lymphoma cells grown from the patient’s lymphomatous 
tonsil. In contrast, the HLA-B*44:03–restricted EBV-CTL line was 
cytotoxic in vitro against both the patient’s HLA-B*44:03+
 EBV+
lymphoma and HLA-B*44:03+
 EBV B95.8–transformed B lympho￾blastoid cell lines (EBV-BLCLs). These findings provide indirect 
but corroborating evidence supporting the hypothesis that the 
HLA-B*44:03–restricted EBV-CTLs recognized and were able to 
lyse the EBV+
 lymphoma in vivo, while the HLA-A*11:01–restricted 
EBV-CTLs were not.
To better understand the basis for the failure of the HLA￾A*1101–restricted EBV-CTLs, we sequenced the latent proteins 
LMP1, LMP2, EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C 
from the EBV virus in the lymphoma cells grown from the patient 
and compared these sequences with those of EBV strain B95.8, 
focusing on sequences encoding all epitopes known to be pre￾sented by HLA-A*1101. Concurrently, we identified the pep￾tide epitopes targeted by the HLA-A*1101–restricted EBV-CTL 
lines. Line A was specific for 2 EBNA3B peptides, 416IVTDFSVIK 
els of EBV-CTLps during the treatment cycle (Figure 5). Among 
responders, EBV-CTLp frequencies increased by a mean of 294-
fold over preinfusion levels compared with a 3.4-fold increase in 
nonresponders (Table 4; P = 0.001). Increases in EBV-CTLp fre￾quencies observed in patients responding to their first cycle were 
usually detected by 10–21 days after the initial infusion and coin￾cided with clinical improvement. Increases in EBV-CTLps were 
also detected in 6 of 7 patients with SD after the first cycle who 
ultimately achieved a CR or PR.
The contrast between expansion of EBV-CTLps in responding 
patients and the lack thereof in patients with POD was also observed 
in the same patient among those who failed to respond to EBV-CTLs

We also evaluated the lymphoma cells for the presence of 
EBNA3B protein. By FACS analysis, EBNA3B was detected at fluo￾rescence intensity levels comparable to those in EBV-BLCLs trans￾formed by EBV strain 95.8. The lymphoma cells also expressed 
HLA-A*1101 protein, as assessed by FACS analysis of the cells 
using an HLA-A*1101–specific antibody (MyBioSource Inc.).
and 551DEPASTEPVHDQLL, known to be presented by HLA￾A*1101. The DNA sequences for both of these EBNA3B peptides 
in the patient’s lymphoma cells and the B95.8 strains of EBV 
were identical. Line B was also specific for 551DEPASTEPVHD￾QLL. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient cells from line C 
to establish this specificity.

Discussion
This study details the effects of partially HLA-matched, appropri￾ately restricted, “off-the-shelf ” third-party EBV-CTLs in the treat￾ment of 46 recipients of allogeneic HCT or SOT with EBV+
 lympho￾mas who had failed treatment with rituximab. The EBV-CTLs were 
derived from a bank of 330 cryopreserved EBV-CTL lines, generated 
under good manufacturing practice (GMP) and precharacterized 
as to HLA type, immune phenotype, lack of alloreactivity, EBV￾specific cytotoxicity, and HLA restriction. This precharacteriza￾tion permitted selection and treatment with appropriately HLA￾restricted EBV-CTLs, within as few as 1–2 days of patient referral.
In vivo, the EBV-CTLs were well tolerated. No HCT or SOT 
recipient exhibited evidence of graft rejection or required treat￾ment for a flare of GvHD; de novo GvHD requiring treatment was 
observed in only 1 patient who experienced a grade 1, transient 
skin rash. Furthermore, clinical responses were not associated 
with the cytokine release syndrome observed in patients respond￾ing to T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (42). Thus, 
adoptive transfer of these EBV-CTLs has been safe.
The EBV+ lymphomas targeted by the third-party EBV￾CTLs in this study uniformly presented as rapidly developing B 
cell malignancies that were monomorphic diffuse large B cell 
lymphomas in 80% of the cases. All 46 patients had rituximab￾refractory disease, 20 had also failed to respond to chemother￾apy and/or radiation therapy, 26 of 46 (56%) had disease in at 
least 3 anatomic sites, and 13 of the other 20 patients (65%) had 
extranodal disease, including 7 with disease in the CNS. These 
disease characteristics have been associated with a uniformly 
poor prognosis (10). Nevertheless, 68% of the HCT recipients 
and 54% of the SOT recipients treated with third-party EBV￾CTLs achieved a CR or durable PR.
These results are similar to those we previously reported for 
HCT recipients with rituximab-refractory EBV lymphomas treated 
with HCT donor–derived EBV-CTLs (17). However, those patients 
usually responded by 3 weeks after a single cycle of EBV-CTLs. 
HLA-disparate third-party EBV-CTLs may persist for extended 
periods in organ allograft recipients maintained on nonsteroidal 
immunosuppressive drugs 
Because of limitations in the number of lymphocytes left after 
sequential testing of EBV-CTLps, we were only able to assess the 
persistence of the third-party EBV-CTLs in 3 HCT and 2 SOT recip￾ients. In 2 HCT patients tested before the second and third doses 
in a 3-week cycle, IFN-γ+
 EBV-CTLs detected were exclusively from 
the third-party donor, as shown for patient UPN 5603 in Figure 7A. 
However, in the second patient, who had only achieved SD, these T 
cells could not be detected 5 days after the third dose in the cycle. In 
the third patient, UPN 5597 (depicted in Figure 6), who had failed 
treatment with HLA-A*1101–restricted EBV-CTLs but achieved a 
PR after an initial cycle of treatment with EBV-CTLs restricted by 
HLA-B*4403 (donor D), IFN-γ+
 T cells bearing short tandem repeats 
(STRs) unique to donor D were detectable at least through 18 days 
after the last infusion of that first cycle of donor D EBV-CTLs. At 
the same time, EBV-CTLs from the prior donors were not detected 
(Figure 6D). Unfortunately, later samples were not available.
Of 2 SOT patients who were treated while on tacrolimus or 
sirolimus, one who failed to respond did not have IFN-γ+
 EBV￾CTLs bearing STRs unique to the third-party donor 24 days after 
completion of her second treatment cycle. In contrast, the other 
patient, a renal allograft recipient who achieved a durable PR after 
treatment with third-party EBV-CTLs matched for 6 of 10 HLA 
alleles, had T cells bearing STRs unique to the third-party donor 
7 days after his first dose and again at 22 days after his first cycle. 
Strikingly, these third-party T cells still represented 16% of the 
IFN-γ+
 T cells responding to the EBV peptide pool 23.7 months 
after his last dose of these cells (Figure 7B). In contrast, in a third 
patient, a heart allograft recipient, who achieved a PR of a host￾origin EBV lymphoma after repeated courses of EBV-CTLs from 2 
donors, including her HLA haplotype–mismatched mother, IFN-γ+
EBV-specific CTLs that were exclusively of host type were detect￾ed from 6 months to a year after completion of adoptive therapy.

We could not predict responders on 
the basis of doses of EBV-CTLps or the 
immunophenotype of the T cells admin￾istered. While Haque et al. (29) reported 
higher response rates in patients treat￾ed with more closely HLA-matched 
EBV-CTLs, we found no significant cor￾relation between degree of HLA match 
and subsequent response. However, we 
selected EBV-CTLs primarily on the basis 
of restriction by an HLA allele that would 
be shared by the patient’s EBV-associated 
lymphoma. HLA restriction was priori￾tized because the EBV-CTLs in each line 
were usually restricted by only 1–3 HLA 
alleles and our prior studies, both in mice 
bearing multiple EBV-BLCL xenografts 
(43) and in patients receiving transplant 
donor–derived EBV-CTLs (18), had 
shown that such T cells selectively accu￾mulate in and only induce remissions 
of tumors coexpressing EBV and the 
HLA allele by which the EBV-CTLs are 
restricted. Since third-party EBV-CTLs 
are rarely fully HLA-matched, they may 
be restricted by HLA alleles not shared by 
the patient’s disease. Thus, selection on 
the basis of HLA restriction may super￾sede the impact of matching for more 
HLA alleles.
Selection of EBV-CTL lines based on 
predetermined HLA restriction also pro￾vides particular advantages for treatment 
of EBV lymphomas of undefined origin 
in recipients of an HLA-disparate HCT, 
SOT, or cord blood graft, since an EBV￾CTL restricted by an HLA allele shared 
by both the transplant donor and recipi￾ent addresses both possibilities.
Although we did not identify third￾party EBV-CTL attributes that predicted responses, in this study, as 
in trials of transplant donor–derived EBV-CTLs (17, 30, 44), increas￾es in the frequency of EBV-specific CTLps were regularly detected 
in patients who achieved CR or PR. They were also observed in 
patients with SD who subsequently attained a CR or PR, but not in 
patients with POD.
In contrast, responses to third-party EBV-CTLs were cumulative, 
requiring a median of 2 cycles to achieve CR or durable PR. This 
finding likely reflects the more limited potential of third-party T 
cells to persist after transfer, as may the initial SDs achieved by 
first cycles in ultimately responsive lymphomas and the lower rate 
of CRs in less immunocompromised SOT recipients.

donor EBV-CTLs were still detectable 23.7 
months after the last infusion.

A striking, but yet poorly understood, finding has been the 
durability of both CRs and PRs observed following adoptive trans￾fer of third-party EBV-CTLs. Because these T cells are allogeneic 
to both HCT and SOT recipients, we expected these T cells to be 
rejected. Indeed, the rationale for giving repeated 3-week cycles 
of cells was the hypothesis that such repeated doses would provide 
a more sustained exposure to the adoptively transferred EBV-CT￾Ls. The cumulative nature of the responses observed following 
cycles of third-party EBV-CTLs also provides indirect evidence 
consistent with this hypothesis, as does the predominance of PRs 
observed in SOT patients, which contrasts with the preponderance 
of CRs achieved in the more T cell–deficient HCT recipients. That 
the increments in CTLp frequencies after each dose usually lasted 
for only 2–4 weeks also suggests their engraftment is brief. Thus, 
although the initial responses were closely related to increases in 
EBV-CTLps, with IFN-γ+
 EBV-specific T cells of third-party donor 
origin by STR detected 10–21 days after infusion, the durability of 
responses observed more likely reflects activation of endogenous 
T cell responses. This is potentially stimulated by cross-presenta￾tion of antigens from EBV-associated lymphomas targeted by the 
third-party EBV-CTLs and potentially by recruitment of endoge￾nous T cells responding to the allogeneic third-party effector cells. 
However, based on our findings and data from prior reports (29, 
32), the possibility that persisting small populations of third-party 
EBV-CTLs also contribute to this durability must be considered. 
Previously, Leen et al. (32) and Haque et al. (29) have reported 
detection of third-party EBV-CTLs up to 94 days after infusion, in 
HCT and SOT recipients, respectively. While we found EBV-spe￾cific T cells of third-party origin (by STR) in 2 HCT recipients 
tested at 5 and 18 days following infusion, we did not have later 
samples to ascertain persistence. However, the finding of EBV￾reactive third-party T cells in 1 SOT recipient at 23.7 months after 
infusion indicates that in some patients, these functional but 
HLA-disparate third-party EBV-CTLs can persist for extended 
periods. This persistence may be due to the ongoing immuno￾suppressive effects of tacrolimus. The possibility that the EBV￾CTLs also contribute to their own survival through a veto func￾tion (50) also warrants evaluation. Ultimately, ongoing studies 
of the distribution and fate of genetically distinguishable third￾party EBV-CTLs should clarify the relative contribution of the 
adoptively transferred EBV-CTLs and any endogenously gener￾ated T cells to the enduring responses observed.
In summary, third-party EBV-CTLs that are partially HLA￾matched and appropriately HLA restricted can induce durable 
CRs or PRs in a high proportion of HCT and SOT patients with 
high-risk, rituximab-refractory EBV lymphomas without sig￾nificant toxicity, graft injury, or GvHD. Maximal responses are 
cumulative, requiring, on average, two 3-week cycles of EBV-CTL 
infusions. Patients responding to a particular EBV-CTL line dis￾tinctively exhibit increases in the frequency of EBV-specific T cells 
in the blood within 10–21 days of the first infusion. Furthermore, 
patients with POD after 1 cycle can respond to treatment with an 
alternate EBV-CTL line specific for a different epitope presented 
by an alternate HLA allele shared by the lymphoma. Thus, off￾the-shelf EBV-CTLs can provide multiple immediately accessible 
options for potentially curative treatment of high-risk EBV lym￾phomas complicating HCT or SOT.
Multiple factors may contribute to POD despite treatment 
with appropriately HLA-restricted EBV-CTLs. Disease status 
affects outcome, since patients with extensively pretreated lym￾phomas or extranodal disease at time of referral had a poorer 
prognosis. Host factors (e.g., allospecific antibodies or residual 
alloresponsive T cells) could also induce rejection of EBV-CTLs 
early after infusion. Furthermore, EBV has developed multiple 
mechanisms to evade EBV-CTLs, ranging from epitope variation 
between different EBV strains (45, 46) to viral-encoded evasins 
that can usurp antigen processing and presentation, downregu￾late specific HLA alleles (47, 48), or directly inhibit T cell function 
(49). In our study, the consistent correlation observed between 
POD and failure of adoptively transferred EBV-CTLs to expand 
in vivo usually reflects the inability of EBV-CTLs to recognize 
the patient’s EBV lymphoma. Previously (17), we reported 3 
patients who failed to respond to HCT donor–derived EBV-CT￾Ls, even though the EBV lymphoma in each patient was of HCT 
donor origin. In each case, the EBV-CTLs lysed autologous 
B95.8 virus–transformed B cells used to sensitize the T cells but 
not autologous EBV+
 cells grown from the patient’s lymphoma. 
However, T cells sensitized with the autologous lymphoma cells 
killed both donor-derived tumor and B95.8-transformed BLCLs, 
suggesting a lack of an antigen on the lymphoma recognized by 
B95.8-sensitized T cells rather than a functional impairment of 
the presentation of EBV antigens by the EBV lymphoma cells. 
In a similar case, Gottschalk et al. (41) demonstrated that spon￾taneously transformed EBV+
 B cells isolated from a patient who 
failed to respond to EBV B95.8–sensitized T cells had a mutation 
resulting in deletion of the 2 epitopes of EBNA3B presented by 
HLA-A*11:01 targeted by those T cells.
In our patient UPN 5597, sequencing of EBV DNA encoding 
latent EBV proteins from the lymphomatous tonsil did not reveal 
mutations or deletions that would alter EBNA3B epitopes tar￾geted by the HLA-A1101–restricted T cells. Furthermore, both 
EBNA3B and HLA-A1101 were normally expressed. These find￾ings suggest that the presentation of targeted epitopes of EBNA3B 
by HLA-A1101 is otherwise impaired, potentially reflecting EBV￾derived evasins capable of selectively interfering with antigen 
processing or transporter associated with antigen processing￾mediated peptide transfer to HLA-A1101 for presentation (48, 49). 
These mechanisms are under study.
Based on our initial findings, we hypothesized that for patients 
with POD, selection of an alternate CTL line, particularly one spe￾cific for an epitope presented by another HLA allele shared by the 
patient’s disease, might prove effective. Our analyses of UPN 5597 
(Figure 6) support this hypothesis. Furthermore, this “switch” 
therapy has induced durable complete or partial remissions in 3 
of 5 patients who had POD after their first cycle. These respons￾es were also closely correlated with expansions of EBV-CTLps in 
the blood. Thus, in patients with POD, switching to EBV-CTLs 
restricted by a different shared HLA allele can provide effector 
cells able to recognize the tumor, and induce remissions of dis￾ease. Furthermore, since 9 of 11 patients with POD who received 
only 1 cycle of EBV-CTLs died of lymphoma at a median of 28 
days after initiation of EBV-CTL therapy, a trial of switch therapy 
in patients who continue to progress through the first 21 days of a 
cycle is warranted.

Bank V01555.2) and covered coding regions of 7 EBV latent genes 
(LMP1, LMP2, EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C). Cap￾ture pools were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 System in a 100 bp/100 
bp or 125 bp/125 bp paired-end run, using the HiSeq 3000/4000 SBS 
Kit (Illumina). An average of 2.7 million paired reads were generated 
per sample. Guided assembly of sequence reads was performed using 
Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (SourceForge) against reference B95.8 
genome (GenBank V01555.2).
Generation and characterization of EBV-CTL lines. EBV-CTLs 
were generated from a leukapheresis or unit of blood provided by 
healthy EBV-seropositive HCT donors who consented to these dona￾tions for the expressed purpose of generating EBV-CTLs for adop￾tive therapy in the recipient of their HCT or other patients with EBV￾associated malignancies. The bank of 330 EBV-CTL lines was gen￾erated under FDA-compliant, good manufacturing practice (GMP) 
conditions as previously described (17). Briefly, T cells, enriched 
from PBMCs by depletion of monocytes by plastic adherence and 
of NK cells by adsorption to anti-CD56 immunomagnetic beads 
(Miltenyi Biotec), were sensitized in vitro at a 20:1 responder/stimu￾lator (R/S) ratio with irradiated autologous EBV-transformed B cells 
(EBV-BLCLs) generated previously by transformation with the B95.8 
strain of EBV (provided by C. Rooney, Baylor College of Medicine, 
Houston, Texas, USA). T cells were then cultured in Yssel’s medi￾um (Gemini Bioproducts) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated 
pooled normal human serum and restimulated with the same EBV￾BLCLs weekly at a 4:1 R/S ratio.
Beginning day 16, IL-2 (Novartis) was added at 10–50 IU/mL 3 
times per week. After 28–35 days of culture, T cells were character￾ized by flow cytometry and evaluated for EBV-specific cytotoxic￾ity, lack of alloreactivity, and HLA restrictions (17). T cells meeting 
release criteria for adoptive therapy were aliquoted into labeled vials 
and cryopreserved.
The frequency of EBV-specific and alloreactive CTL precursors 
(CTLps) in EBV-CTL lines was measured by limiting dilution analy￾sis (LDA) (14). When possible, the ability of EBV-CTLs to recognize 
endogenous EBV derived from a patient was assessed by measure￾ment of cytotoxic activity against spontaneously transformed EBV+
 B 
cells cultured from either a tumor biopsy or the PBMCs of the patient.
The epitope specificities of certain HLA-restricted third-party 
EBV-CTLs used for treatment were identified by assessment of their 
cytotoxicity against autologous PHA blasts loaded with different epi￾topes of each latent EBV protein known to be presented by an HLA 
allele of the T cell donor, as previously described (17).
Patient evaluations. Patients were monitored for response by 
sequential clinical assessments, and imaging by CT, PET/CT, and/
or MRI prior to and at the end of each cycle or as clinically indicated. 
EBV DNA copy numbers in the blood were monitored from 1995 to 
2003 with a semiquantitative PCR-amplified assay and since 2003 
with a quantitative real-time PCR assay. Patients were also monitored 
closely for serious adverse events using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Toxicity Grading Criteria and for acute GvHD as 
graded by the NCI consensus criteria (https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/
CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03/Archive/CTCAE_4.0_2009-05-29_Quick￾Reference_8.5x11.pdf).
EBV-CTLp frequencies in the blood were quantitated by LDA (14) 
before EBV-CTL infusions and thereafter on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28, 
monthly for 4 months, and at 6- to 12-month intervals thereafter.
Methods
Patients. A total of 46 patients received third-party EBV-CTLs between 
October 2005 and May 2015 as treatment for EBV-associated B cell lym￾phomas that developed after an allogenic HCT (n = 33) or SOT (n = 13) 
and were refractory to or relapsed after therapy with rituximab.
Study approval. All patients gave written consent and were treated 
on 1 of 2 consecutive single-arm phase II protocols (NCT01498484 
and NCT00002663, www.ClinicalTrials.gov) approved by the IRB 
at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, by the FDA, and by 
the National Marrow Donor Program IRB. For completeness, we have 
included 4 patients previously reported (17, 30) who were the first to 
receive third-party EBV-CTLs following approval of the amendment 
of IRB 95-024 (NCT00002663) permitting their use. These patients 
are UPN 3520, UPN 5603, UPN 5628, and UPN 5629, identified by 
superscript “F” in Supplemental Table 1.
Trial treatment consisted of EBV-CTLs matched with the patient 
for at least 2 of 10 HLA alleles by high-resolution typing (HLA-A, -B, 
-C, -DR, or -DQ) and restricted by an HLA allele shared by the EBV 
lymphoma (when origin was known) and the HCT donor and patient 
for HCT recipients or the patient for SOT recipients. A treatment 
cycle consisted of 3 weekly i.v. infusions of 1 × 106 (protocol 1) or 2 × 
106 (protocol 2) EBV-CTLs/kg, followed by a 3-week period of obser￾vation. Patients failing to achieve CR who had no therapy-related 
toxicity could receive additional cycles or be referred for alternate 
therapy. Primary study endpoints were (a) incidence of complete or 
partial responses as determined by clinical and radiographic criteria, 
and (b) incidence of infusion-related toxicities, alterations of HCT 
or SOT function, or GvHD. Secondary endpoints included (a) alter￾ations in EBV DNA levels and (b) alterations in EBV-CTL precursor 
frequency measured in sequential blood specimens obtained before 
and after each infusion.
Diagnosis and characterization of EBV-LPD. The EBV-associated 
lymphomas were classified according to the WHO criteria (51). Biop￾sy specimens were tested for EBV by in situ hybridization for EBV￾encoded small RNAs and in some cases by immunohistology for LMP1. 
They were also tested for B and T cell markers. Whenever possible, 
we examined the EBV+
 tumor cells for clonality of the B cells and their 
origin (host or donor). The genetic origin of the lymphoma was identi￾fied as donor or host, using FISH for XX versus XY in sex-mismatched 
transplants and using donor- or host-unique PCR-amplified STR poly￾morphisms (52, 53). Clonality of the tumors was identified by analysis 
of immunoglobulin rearrangements (54). Clonality of the EBV virus 
was determined by the method of Gulley and Raab-Traub (55).
In the case of UPN 5597, we were able to grow the clonal EBV 
lymphoma cells from the diseased tonsil and evaluate their sensitivity 
to lysis by the HLA-A1101– and HLA-B4403–restricted EBV-specific 
T cells sequentially infused for treatment. We also used next-genera￾tion sequencing to sequence the DNA of the EBV latent proteins from 
those lymphoma cells and compared the sequences of the latent EBV 
proteins and, particularly, the epitopes targeted by the EBV-specific T 
cells with those of the B95.8 strain of EBV.
For DNA sequencing, BLCL genomic libraries were constructed 
from 100 ng DNA using KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KK8504, Kapa Biosys￾tems) with 8 cycles of PCR. After sample barcoding, 130 ng–1.2 μg of 
each library was pooled and captured twice by hybridization with 112 
EBV-specific biotinylated baits (Integrated DNA Technologies). Baits 
were designed based on complete sequence of B95.8 genome (Gen-

To test for the presence of third-party EBV-CTLs in the circula￾tion after adoptive transfer, EBV-reactive T cells were examined for 
third-party donor–specific STRs as previously described to monitor 
marrow chimerism (52, 53). Briefly, Ficoll-Hypaque–separated PBMCs 
were sensitized for 12 hours with either a pool of EBV peptides (JPT 
Peptide Technologies), irradiated EBV-BLCLs from the HCT donor, or 
spontaneously EBV-transformed cells grown from the patient’s tumor. 
EBV-reactive T cell fractions were isolated by FACS sorting of CD3+
 T 
cells coexpressing IFN-γ, or by immunoadsorption of activated CD3+
 T 
cells coexpressing CD137. DNA from the CD137-enriched fractions as 
well as DNA from blood samples from the patient before transplanta￾tion, the HCT donor, and the third-party EBV-CTL donor was extract￾ed using Qiagen EZ1 DNA blood kits. Samples were tested using prim￾ers from 2 autosomal STR kits (GenePrint Fluorescent STR multiplex 
systems: CTTv and GammaSTR kits) following the manufacturer’s 
protocol (Promega Corp.). Up to 8 loci were examined to identify the 
most informative alleles for quantitative assessment of host and donor 
proportions. Fluorescently labeled PCR products were detected using 
an ABI 3730 Genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ana￾lyzed with GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems). The presence 
of third-party donor cells was determined by identification of unique 
donor peaks not present in the host, or the transplant donor.
Statistics. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate probability 
of survival over time. Comparisons of response rates between groups were 
assessed with Fisher’s exact test. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to 
determine whether there was a trend between the degree of HLA match￾ing with the transplant donor or recipient and the patient’s response. The 
Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate whether CD4+
 T cell or 
EBV-CTLp frequencies in the EBV-CTLs correlated with response.
Study approval. The studies presented were approved by the Insti￾tutional Review Board at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 
(New York, New York, USA), the FDA, and the National Marrow Donor 
Program. All subjects or their legal proxy provided informed consent 
prior to their participation in the studies.
