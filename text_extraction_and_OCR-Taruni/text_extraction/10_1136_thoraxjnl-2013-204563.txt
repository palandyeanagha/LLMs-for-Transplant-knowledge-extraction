Abstract
Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are commonly used in the
management of malignant pleural effusion (MPE). There is little
data on their use in non-malignant conditions. All IPC insertions for
non-malignant cases from five large UK centres were found using
prospectively maintained databases. Data were collected on 57 IPC
insertions. The commonest indications were hepatic hydrothorax
(33%) and inflammatory pleuritis (26%). The mean weekly fluid
output was 2.8 L (SD 2.52). 48/57 (84%) patients had no
complications. Suspected pleural infection was documented in 2
(3.5%) cases. 33% (19/57) of patients underwent ‘spontaneous’
pleurodesis at a median time of 71 days. Patients with hepatic


disease achieved pleurodesis significantly less often than those with
non-hepatic disease (p=0.03). These data support the use of IPCs in
select cases of non-malignant disease when maximal medical
therapy has failed.
