We report reference values for osteocalcin and bone and liver 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoforms in serum from 114 healthy 
children and adolescents, age 7-16 y. The bone and liver ALP 
isoforms were measured by high performance liquid chromatog￾raphy (HPLC). Six ALP isoforms were separated and quantified 
in all samples: one bonelintestinal (BA), two bone (Bl and B2), 
and three liver ALP isoforms (Ll, L2, and L3). It is especially 
important to make distinctions between ages and gender during 
puberty in the interpretation of biochemical markers of bone. We 
observed that girls reached adult levels for osteocalcin, total 
ALP, and bone ALP isoforms, BA, B 1, and B2, earlier than boys. 
Girls in the oldest age group (15-16 y) and in the pubertal stage 
groups IV-V, reached higher levels than boys for the calculated 
ratio B lB2 due to a more rapid decline of B2 compared with B 1. 
ALP is one of the most thoroughly investigated enzymes in 
the routine clinical chemistry laboratory and the most fre￾quently used biochemical marker for osteoblastic bone forma￾tion. At least four human gene loci are encoding for the ALP 
isoenzymes; "tissue nonspecific," placental, germ cell, and 
small intestinal locus (1). ALP from the tissue nonspecific 
locus is expressed in tissues such as bone, liver, and kidney. 
Different carbohydrate side chains or maybe remaining frag￾ments of the in situ cell membrane glycosyl-phosphatidylino￾sit01 anchor, or both, yields "tissue-specific" structures in the 
ALP isoforms from this gene locus (2). In concordance with 
strict isoenzyme definition (3), bone and liver ALP should be 
referred to as isoforms of the same isoenzyme. 
Osteocalcin (bone-Gla protein) is a bone matrix protein of 
49 amino acid residues (molecular mass 5800 D) containing 
three calcium binding y-carboxyglutamic acids which is 
mainly synthesized in bone by osteoblasts. Only a small 
amount is synthesized in dentine by odontoblasts. The synthe￾Received December 19, 1994; accepted June 27, 1995.

This observation might indicate that B2, to a higher extent than 
the B 1 isoform, represent a more mature expression of osteoblast 
differentiation during matrix mineralization in growing bone. 
Serial measurements of these new bone ALP isoforms could 
provide new insights into bone and mineral metabolism. (Pediatr

of bone formation and reflects an altered bone metabolism in 
patients with metabolic bone disorders characterized by in￾creased or decreased bone turnover (4). Osteocalcin and the 
bone ALP isoforms appears to reflect different stages in the 
differentiation of osteoblastic cells leading to formation of 
calcified extracellular matrix in shape of hydroxyapatite, 
Ca10(0H)2(P04)6 (5). 
Reference values in healthy children and adolescents for 
total ALP have frequently been reported (6, 7). However, 
reference values in children and adolescents for bone and liver 
ALP (8-12), and osteocalcin (13-16) are more sparse. Age, 
sex, race, pubertal, and skeletal maturation are some factors 
that reflect reference value differences for osteocalcin and the 
bone ALP isoforms. 
We have recently described a new HPLC method which can 
detect six different ALP isoforms; one bonelintestinal (BIT), 
two bone (B1 and B2), and three liver ALP isoforms (Ll, L2 
and L3) (17, 18). This study describes reference values in

METHODS 
MAGNUSS 10N ET AL. 
RESULTS 
Subjects. We studied 114 healthy children and adolescents 
from age 7 to 16 y, 57 boys 10.8 + 2.4 y (mean + SD), and 
57 girls 11.6 5 2.5 y. They were recruited from a local school 
population in Linkoping, Sweden, and all were reported to be 
healthy and engaged in normal activities for their age. No one 
was receiving any drug therapy at the time for blood sampling. 
Puberty was staged in both boys and girls from I (prepubertal) 
to V (adult), according to the Tanner scale (19). Blood samples 
were taken between 1000 and 1400 h, and serum was stored at 
-70°C until analyzed. 
Laboratory methods. We determined serum bone and liver 
ALP isoforms with a previously described HPLC method (17, 
18). A weak anion-exchange column, SynChropak AP300 (250 
X 4.6 mm inside diameter) (SynChrom Inc., Lafayette, IN), 
was used instead of the referred SynChropak AX300. Syn￾Chropak AP300 is a modified SynChropak AX300 which has 
been optimized for ALP isoform analysis. With SynChropak 
AP300 the resolution between the bone and liver ALP isoforms 
is increased. The only difference in the laboratory procedure is 
that a lower mobile phase pH has to be used, pH 7.6 instead of 
pH 7.8. Reaction pH in the postcolumn reactor is not altered by 
the decreased mobile phase pH because of the low buffer 
strength, 20 mM Tris acetate, compared with the high buffer 
strength in the substrate, 0.25 M diethanolamine. A lower 
mobile phase pH and two precolumns filled with SynChrosorb 
AX (SynChrom Inc., Lafayette, IN) were installed to increase 
the column life and protect the silica-based weak anion ex￾changer. The precolumns were temperature-controlled at 30°C 
and installed on-line before the solvent mixing module to 
maintain the same dwell volume as before, 5.4 mL. Details on 
peak characterization, precision, analytical recovery, linearity 
data, and detection limit have been published elsewhere (17). 
Serum total ALP activity (37°C) was measured on a Hitachi 
717 analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Ger￾many) (20). Osteocalcin was determined by a commercially 
available RIA kit (INCSTAR, Stillwater, MN) with a double 
antibody technique (21). The intra- and interassay coefficients 
of variation at our laboratory for the osteocalcin assay were 
3.4% at 7.4 pg/L and 10.2% at 5.0 pgL, respectively. 
Statistics. All calculations were performed on an Apple 
Computer, Macintosh, with the Statview@ 4.01 program 
(Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA, 1993). Nonparametric 
statistics were used because the distributions were not Gauss￾ian and consent to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Transform￾ing the data to form a Gaussian distribution, e.g. by logarithms, 
would imply different transforming functions for different ana￾lytes. Differences between the age, sex, and pubertal stage 
groups were studied by the Mann-Whitney test. The Kruskal￾Wallis test was used if more than two groups were compared. 
A p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant. 
Ethics. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee 
of Linkoping University Hospital. Informed consent was ob￾tained from the children and their parents before participation 
in the study. 
We were able to separate and quantify six ALP isoforms in 
all serum samples from the children and adolescents: one 
bonelintestinal, two bone and three liver ALP isoforms. A 
typical chromatographic ALP isoform pattern is presented for 
a healthy girl, 11 y of age, pubertal stage 11, with osteocalcin 
11.3 pg/L and B1lB2 0.31 (Fig. 1). 
The healthy children and adolescents were grouped into five 
age groups: 7-8 y of age (n = 15), 9-10 y (n = 33), 11-12 y 
(n = 26), 13-14 y (n = 25), and 15-16 y (n = 15). The 
Kruskal-Wallis test showed highly significant variations be￾tween the five age groups for: osteocalcin (p < 0.002), total 
ALP (p < 0.0001), B/I (p < 0.0012), B1 (p < 0.0001), B2 (p 
< 0.0004), and BID32 (p < 0.0025). Age- and sex-related 
percentiles (25, 50, and 75), minimum and maximum values, 
are presented for osteocalcin and total ALP (Table 1); BII, B1, 
B2 and BID32 (Table 2). The divergence between females and 
males during the years of childhood and adolescence is also 
presented for total ALP (Fig. 2), B1 (Fig. 3), and B2 (Fig. 4). 
Our study subjects were also classified according to the 
Tanner scale and grouped into three categories of pubertal 
stages: pubertal stage I (n = 60), pubertal stage 11-111 (n = 27), 
and pubertal stage IV-V (n = 27). The Kruskal-Wallis test 
showed significant variations between the three puberty stage 
categories for total ALP (p < 0.0015), BII (p < 0.03), B1 (p 
< 0.0015), and B2 (p < 0.0045). For osteocalcin (p < 0.06) 
and BIB2 (p < 0.15), variations were considered not signif￾icant. Pubertal stage- and sex-related percentiles (25, 50, and 
75), minimum and maximum values are presented for osteo￾calcin and total ALP (Table 3); B/I, Bl, B2, and BIB2 (Table 
4).

For girls, no significant differences were found with the 
Mann-Whitney test between the pubertal stage categories I and 
11-111. For boys, significant differences were found for total 
ALP (p < 0.05) and B2 (p < 0.04). However, the Mann￾Whitney test showed highly significant differences between 
girls in pubertal stage category IV-V compared with the other 
two categories, I and 11-111. IV-V compared with I: osteocalcin, 
total ALP, BII, B1, and B2 (p < 0.0001), and BIB2 (p < 
0.02). IV-V compared with 11-111: osteocalcin (p < 0.002), 
total ALP (p < 0.0001), BII (p < 0.0005), B1 (p < 0.0001), 
B2 (p < 0.0002), and BIB2 (p < 0.05). For boys, no 
significant differences were found between the same pubertal 
stage categories, i.e. IV-V compared with I and IV-V com￾pared with 11-111. 
The liver ALP isoforms, L1, L2, and L3, are presented 
together as one group because no significant differences were 
found between the age, sex, and pubertal stage groups. Refer￾ence intervals by 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for children and 
adolescents (n = 114), age 7-16 y, were L1,0.28-1.16 pkat/L;

DISCUSSION 
Many analytes vary with age and especially those which 
reflects changes during puberty, e.g. biochemical markers of 
bone and mineral metabolism. Infancy through puberty is 
marked by relatively rapid physiologic changes which often

cause differing concentrations in biochemical analytes with 
increasing age. Actually, these differences are de facto ex￾pected, and they simply mean that patients' values have to be 
compared with proper age- and sex-matched reference values. 
For the production of accurate reference values it is recom￾mended by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry, 
IFCC, to have at least 120 subjects per subgroup (22). How￾ever, this is seldom possible because of ethical and practical 
reasons, and it should be kept in mind that for clinical purposes 
a small number of values may still serve as a useful guide. In 
this study we report reference values at percentiles 25, 50, and 
75, in addition to the range, and we preferred not to stress 
statistical theories presenting reference intervals by 2.5 and 
97.5 percentiles because of our small age and pubertal stage 
groups. The only exceptions are the liver ALP isoforms, n = 
114, which are presented as one group. 
When comparing different osteocalcin studies, the measured 
osteocalcin value can differ 10-fold depending on the applied 
method. Masters et al. (23) compared eight commercially 
available assay kits for osteocalcin, and they concluded that 
results cannot be compared between assays even when normal￾ized against healthy subjects. The differences between assays 
are mostly due to different polyclonal, and monoclonal, anti￾bodies recognizing different epitopes of circulating immunore￾active forms of osteocalcin. To our knowledge, there is only 
one previous report on reference values for children and ado￾lescents with the same osteocalcin method as ours. Low and 
Lau (16) investigated 200 healthy Chinese school children and 
adolescents between the ages of 2 and 20 y, however, without 
classification of pubertal stages. We found a rise in osteocalcin 
with age, in both sexes, and a decline 2 y earlier for girls than 
for boys. At the age of 15-16 y for girls, osteocalcin concen￾trations reached adult levels, in the range 2.8-6.9 pgL. The 
reported reference values for adults with this osteocalcin 
method are 1.8-6.6 pg/L (21). Within the pubertal stage group 
IV-V a highly significant difference was observed between 
gender, p < 0.0003. 
For adults, the upper reference limit for total ALP is 4.6 
pkat/L in our laboratory. The highest total ALP activity (21.0 
pkat/L) was observed for a boy, 12 y of age, which is 4-5-fold 
more than for healthy adults. Our reference values for total 
ALP are consistent with several other reports (6-12). For girls 
we noted the highest values between 9 and 12 y of age, and for 
boys 2 y later, 11-14 y of age. The activities for the bone ALP 
isoforms BI and B2, are up to 10-fold higher for children and 
adolescents than for adults. This indicates that the measure￾ment of these bone ALP isoforms are more sensitive markers 
of bone and mineral metabolism than total ALP. 
We found the greatest significant differences between the 
five age groups for total ALP and the bone ALP isoforms,

which emphasize the necessity of age-matched reference val￾ues. We also observed significant differences between gender 
within the two oldest age groups, 13-14 and 15-16, for total 
ALP and the bone ALP isoforms. At the age of 14 y some girls 
already reached adult ALP activities. Within the pubertal stage 
groups we noted significant differences between gender only in 
the pubertal stage group IV-V, for the analytes osteocalcin, 
total ALP, B/I, B1, B2, and B1/B2. The significant differences 
between the sexes were even more pronounced in the pubertal 
stage group IV-V than within the oldest age group (15-16 y). 
Van Hoof et al. (11) separated ALP isoforms by agarose 
electrophoresis and were able to separate two bone ALP 
isoforms in children and adolescents, however, their "bone 
variant" ALP isoform was not detectable after age 17 y in 
female subjects and after age 20 y in male subjects. Their 
"bone variant" ALP isoform probably corresponds to our 
detected B1 isoform. With this sensitive HPLC method we 
have not encountered any problems in detecting the bone and 
liver ALP isoforms, even in serum from adults with hypophos￾phatasia, at a total ALP 0.5 pkat/L (17). 
The significance of the calculated ratio B1432 is not clear. 
However, we have found values of BIB2 below and above the 
reported reference values during analysis of serum from pa￾tients with metabolic bone diseases, in spite of activities within 
the reference values for the B1 and B2 isoforms. For B1B2, 
similar observations were found as for osteocalcin, total ALP, 
B/I, B1, and B2, i.e. significant differences between gender 
within the oldest age group (15-16 y), and within the pubertal 
stage group IV-V. These differences occurred because girls 
reached higher levels of B 1432, hence of a more rapid decline 
for B2 than for the B1 isoform. This observation might indicate 
that B2, to a higher extent than the B1 isoform, represent a 
more mature expression of osteoblast differentiation during 
matrix mineralization in growing bone. 
The bone ALP isoforms are involved in matrix mineraliza￾tion and functions as ecto-enzymes attached to cell membranes 
by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. High activities of 
ALP have also been reported to be located in matrix vesicles at 
sites of mineralization (24). As biochemical markers for bone 
metabolism, bone ALP isoforms may reflect different stages in 
differentiation of cartilage cells or osteoblast precursors origi￾nating from stromal stem cells present in bone marrow. These 
isoforms could also arise from the fact that human bone is a 
heterogeneous tissue consisting of trabecular and cortical bone 
with a wide morphologic variety. Remaining fragments of the 
cell membrane anchor or different carbohydrate side chains, or 
both, are other possible reasons why different bone ALP 
isoforms such as B/I, B1, and B2 are present. 
Our reported peak levels for osteocalcin, total ALP and the 
three bone ALP isoforms, B/I, B 1, and B2, follows previously 
reported peak levels for adolescent growth hormone secretion 
(25,26). The adolescent growth spurt is very divergent in boys 
and girls, with girls beginning 2 y earlier and boys having a 
greater spurt. Monitoring growth in children and adolescents 
with different growth hormone disorders is an important issue 
to investigate because both insufficient and excessive amounts 
of growth hormone have unfavorable metabolic effects. In our 
point of view, and others (25, 27), previously reported bio￾chemical markers of bone are not sensitive enough for reliable 
predicting individual response to growth hormone treatment. 
The combined use of several biochemical markers of bone (e.g. 
osteocalcin, bone ALP isoforms, tartrate-resistant acid phos￾phatase, cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I 
collagen, pyridinoline, and deoxypyridinoline cross-links), in￾dicating different aspects of osteoblast and osteoclast prolifer￾ation, differentiation, and function, could provide new insights 
into bone metabolism that have not been possible previously in 
the individual patient. 
The sum of our measured liver ALP isoforms, L1 + L2 + 
L3, is in agreement with the results of Crofton (12) who used 
a wheat germ lectin affinity electrophoresis method. However, 
Crofton could not detect more than one liver ALP isoform in 
healthy children, and before 6 mo of age, no liver ALP 
isoforms were detectable. With the described HPLC method it 
is possible determine the same bone and liver ALP isoforms in 
serum from infants as from children, adolescents and adults. 
We conclude that age- and sex-related reference values are 
essential for the interpretation of biochemical markers of bone 
and mineral metabolism, osteocalcin, total ALP, and bone ALP 
isoforms, B/I, B1, B2, and Bl/B2. It is especially important to 
make distinctions between ages and gender during pubertal 
stage IV-V, hence girls reach adult levels for osteocalcin, total 
ALP, and bone ALP isoforms, B/I, B1, and B2, earlier than
