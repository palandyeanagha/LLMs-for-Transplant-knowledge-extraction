The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 has critical roles in
immune signalling, but how mutations in SHP-1 cause inflam￾matory disease in humans remains poorly defined1
. Mice homo￾zygous for the Tyr208Asn amino acid substitution in the carboxy
terminus of SHP-1 (referred to as Ptpn6spin mice) spontaneously
develop a severe inflammatory syndrome that resembles neutro￾philic dermatosis in humans and is characterized by persistent
footpad swelling and suppurative inflammation2,3. Here we report
that receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)-regulated interleukin
(IL)-1a production by haematopoietic cells critically mediates
chronic inflammatory disease in Ptpn6spin mice, whereas inflamma￾some signalling and IL-1b-mediated events are dispensable. IL-1a
was also crucial for exacerbated inflammatory responses and unre￾mitting tissue damage upon footpad microabrasion of Ptpn6spin
mice. Notably, pharmacological and genetic blockade of the kinase
RIP1 protected against wound-induced inflammation and tissue
damage in Ptpn6spin mice, whereas RIP3 deletion failed to do so.
Moreover, RIP1-mediated inflammatory cytokine production was
attenuated by NF-kB and ERK inhibition. Together, our results
indicate that wound-induced tissue damage and chronic inflam￾mation in Ptpn6spin mice are critically dependent on RIP1-mediated
IL-1a production, whereas inflammasome signalling and RIP3-
mediated necroptosis are dispensable. Thus, we have unravelled a
novel inflammatory circuit in which RIP1-mediated IL-1a secretion
in response to deregulated SHP-1 activity triggers an inflammatory
destructive disease that proceeds independently of inflammasomes
and programmed necrosis.
Mutations in the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase Src
homology region 2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP￾1) are associated with a spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases in humans4,5. Similarly, motheaten null and hypomorphic
alleles of Ptpn6, the gene encoding SHP-1, cause a myeloproliferative
disease in mice that is characterized by chronic inflammation6–9.
Despite being one of the first in vivo genetic models of inflammatory
disease, the prevailing mechanism responsible for SHP-1-driven
inflammation remains to be formally elucidated. Complete character￾ization of the molecular mechanism responsible for SHP-1-mediated
disease has been hindered by the fact that motheaten mice are immu￾nodeficient, develop devastating pneumonitis and glomerulonephritis,
and die by 2–9 weeks of age10. Recently, a new SHP-1 mutant mouse
line (referred to as Ptpn6spin mice) that harbours an Tyr208Asn amino
acid substitution in the C-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-1 was
described3
. Mice homozygous for the hypomorphic spin allele develop
a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease at 8–16 weeks of age
that presents as persistent swelling and suppurative inflammation of
the cutaneous footpad tissue (Fig. 1a)3
. The popliteal lymph nodes that
drain the inflamed feet display massive lymphomegaly and are com￾posed of enhanced numbers of both lymphocytes and myeloid cells
(Fig. 1b). In contrast, lymph nodes that drain non-inflamed areas in
Ptpn6spin mice do not display lymphomegaly (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Diseased Ptpn6spin mice show elevated levels of circulating cytokines
and chemokines that are associated with granulopoiesis and neutro￾phil recruitment (Fig. 1c). Consistent with augmented production of
granulopoietic factors, the inflammatory lesions in the footpads of
mutant mice are dominated by neutrophils (Fig. 1d), and neutrophilia
ensues in the periphery (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover,
spontaneous disease progression in Ptpn6spin mice is characterized by

enhanced frequencies of inflammatory T cells that produce high levels
of IL-17 and IFN-c (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 3) and the accu￾mulation of T cells that exhibit an effector/memory phenotype
(CD44hiCD62Llo) (Supplementary Fig. 4). Analysis of mice before
the onset of overt disease (4–8 weeks of age) reveals that Ptpn6spin mice
possess normal numbers of lymphoid and myeloid cells (Supplemen￾tary Fig. 5), and do not display perturbations in T-cell development,
regulatory T-cell numbers, or T-cell activation status before disease pro￾gression (Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, the Ptpn6spin mutation
does not affect inflammatory cytokine production by peripheral T cells
and other immune cells in young mutant mice (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Previous work established that IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signalling is
required for Ptpn6spin-mediated inflammatory disease3
. However, the
molecular mechanisms operating upstream of IL-1R engagement that
are responsible for spontaneous induction of inflammatory disease are
not known. Inflammasome-driven activation of caspase 1 is increas￾ingly recognized as a central instigator of inflammation and disease
pathology through its critical role in the production of bioactive
IL-1b11. In this context, the NLRP3 inflammasome responds to a mul￾titude of damage-associated danger signals that are associated with
autoinflammation12. To test whether aberrant inflammasome activa￾tion is responsible for inducing inflammatory disease in response to
defective SHP-1 signalling, Ptpn6spin mice were bred to animals that
are deficient in the key inflammasome proteins NLRP3 and caspase 1.
However, homozygous disruption of neither NLRP3 nor caspase 1
rescued Ptpn6spin mice from footpad inflammation (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Fig. 8) and neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 2b). In full
agreement, homozygous deletion of the gene encoding IL-1b also
failed to prevent footpad inflammation and granulocyte recruitment
in Ptpn6spin mice (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 8), nor was
excessive inflammatory cytokine production and cutaneous inflam￾matory disease rescued by genetic deletion of Tlr4 (Supplementary
Fig. 9). In marked contrast, genetic ablation ofIl1a provided significant
protection from the development of footpad inflammatory disease in
Ptpn6 mutant mice (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 8), which was
associated with a return to normal neutrophil numbers (Fig. 2b–d),
and reduced generation of IL-17 producing CD41 helper T (TH17)
cells (Fig. 2e). These findings demonstrate that IL-1a has a central role
in SHP-1-mediated disease progression, which proceeds indepen￾dently of inflammasome activation and IL-1b secretion.
Given that IL-1a acts as an alarmin that orchestrates wound-healing
responses13–15, we next tested whether defective wound healing might
contribute to disease pathogenesis in Ptpn6spin mice. To this end, mice
were subjected to microabrasion injury on the plantar surfaces of the
hind feet, and monitored for incidence of inflammatory responses.
Microabrasion-provoked tissue damage induced similar erythema
and oedema in wild-type and Ptpn6spin mice during the first 48 h.
However, inflammation at the wound site was fully resolved in wild￾type mice by day 14, whereas Ptpn6spin mice developed exacerbated
inflammation that was characterized by intense redness and swelling
of the affected area (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 10). At day 21,
the inability of Ptpn6spin mice to curtail wound inflammation ulti￾mately resulted in the development of a persistent and aggravated state
of footpad inflammation characterized by severe pustular dermatosis
and oedema (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably, genetic
ablation of IL-1a production in Ptpn6spin mice provided full protection
from microabrasion-induced footpad inflammation (Fig. 3a, b and
Supplementary Fig. 10). The microabrasion procedure triggered a
rapid (4–5 h after wound induction) and potent production of inflam￾matory cytokines and chemokines in wild-type mice that was further

exacerbated in Ptpn6spin mice (Fig. 3c). Notably, the enhanced secre￾tion of neutrophilic factors in Ptpn6spin mice was fully rescued in
Ptpn6spin mice lacking IL-1a (Fig. 3c). Augmented wound-healing
responses in Ptpn6spin mice were not the result of global aberra￾tions in inflammation because young Ptpn6spin mice did not display
abnormalities in immune cell composition or inflammatory cytokine
production (Supplementary Figs 5–7). Furthermore, the Ptpn6spin
mutation did not affect the generation of MOG-specific T cells or
neuroinflammation during experimental autoimmune encephalomye￾litis (EAE) in young mice (Fig. 3d, e and Supplementary Fig. 11).
Commensal bacteria are increasingly recognized for their role in the
pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases16, and defects in innate immune
signalling were recently shown to alter the intestinal microbiome17.
Because inflammatory disease was suppressed when Ptpn6spin mice
were derived under germ-free conditions3
, we explored the possibility
of footpad-associated dysbiosis in Ptpn6spin mice. However, total
bacterial counts and composition of the footpad-associated micro￾biome in microabrasion-induced inflammatory skin lesions were com￾parable in separately housed wild-type and Ptpn6spin mice, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 12). Furthermore, we failed to observe enhanced
microabrasion-induced granulopoietic cytokine production in wild￾type mice that were co-housed with Ptpn6spin mice (Supplementary
Fig. 13), indicating that the Ptpn6spin mutation alters immune res￾ponses to normal commensal bacteria rather than modifying the bac￾terial ecology of inflammatory skin lesions. Notably, Ptpn6spin mice
also were hypersensitive in the acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver
injury model that is considered a model for sterile autoinflammation
and wound-healing responses18. IL-1a deletion provided significant
protection from APAP-induced liver injury as evidenced by markedly
reduced serum alanine aminotransferase levels in APAP-challenged
Ptpn6spin3Il1a2/2 mice (Fig. 3f). Together, these results indicate a
critical role for IL-1a in both sterile and commensal-associated inflam￾matory and wound-healing responses of Ptpn6spin mice.
To determine whether SHP-1 regulates inflammatory responses in
haematopoietic or radioresistant cells, bone marrow chimaera mice
were generated. Expression of the hypomorphic Ptpn6spin allele in the
haematopoietic compartment alone promoted spontaneous footpad
inflammation (Fig. 4a) concomitant with augmented cytokine produc￾tion (Fig. 4b) and neutrophilia (Supplementary Fig. 14). In contrast,
chimaeric mice bearing the Ptpn6spin mutation only in radioresistant
cells failed to develop footpad inflammation (data not shown), suggest￾ing that SHP-1 expression in bone-marrow-derived immune cells
rather than in non-haematopoietic cells (such as keratinocytes) is criti￾cal for induction of the autoinflammatory syndrome. Collectively,
these findings suggest that unwarranted IL-1a release in response to
dysregulated SHP-1 activity in haematopoietic cells has a pivotal role in
the induction of inflammatory disease. To identify the bone-marrow￾derived cell populations that are responsible for Ptpn6spin-induced
inflammation, we investigated inflammatory responses in isolated
macrophages and neutrophils as these cell types have been shown to
centrally regulate inflammatory and wound-healing responses19. The
Ptpn6spin mutation did not influence inflammatory cytokine produc￾tion in macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 15). Although Ptpn6spin
neutrophils produced slightly higher levels of the proinflammatory
cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and tumour￾necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
stimulation, production of other pro-inflammatory mediators (KC,
IL-6 and IL-1b) was normal in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 16).
We therefore concluded that modest differences in neutrophil￾associated cytokine production may contribute to, but are unlikely to
accountfully for, the marked inflammatory phenotype observed in vivo.
The kinase RIP1 is emerging as a key regulator of inflammatory
cytokine production and cellular stress20,21. To address the in vivo role
of RIP1 in exacerbated inflammatory cytokine production, Ptpn6spin
mice were pre-treated with either vehicle control (PBS), the RIP1
kinase inhibitor necrostatin 1 (Nec1) or the structurally related inactive
Nec1 analogue (iNec)22 before being subjected to microabrasion injury.
Unlike iNec, Nec1-mediated in vivo inhibition of RIP1 kinase activity
markedly attenuated secretion of inflammatory mediators in Ptpn6spin
mice to levels comparable to those of wild-type mice (Fig. 4c), suggest￾ing a critical role for RIP1 signalling in Ptpn6spin-induced inflam￾matory disease. RIP1-deficient mice suffer from perinatal lethality21,
hampering genetic analysis of the role of RIP1 in Ptpn6spin-induced
autoinflammation. However, the observation that Ptpn6spin-mediated
autoinflammation stems from the haematopoietic compartment
(Fig. 4a, b) provided a rationale to explore the role of RIP1 by means
of fetal liver transplantation experiments. To this end, fetal liver cells

from Ptpn6WTRip11/1, Ptpn6spinRip11/1 and Ptpn6spinRip12/2
embryos collected at embryonic (E) day E14.5 were transferred into
irradiated CD45.1 congenic mice. Reconstitution of recipient mice with
control Ptpn6spinRip11/1 fetal liver cells resulted in unremitting foot￾pad swelling, whereas genetic deletion of Rip1 in the haematopoietic
compartment provided protection against Ptpn6spin-associated inflam￾matory disease progression (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 17) and
neutrophilia (Fig. 4e), a hallmark of this inflammatory syndrome. We
proposed that targeted MAP kinase and NF-kB signalling drives
Ptpn6spin-associated inflammation. In agreement, we found that in vivo
RIP1 inhibition markedly dampened local activation of ERK and NF￾kB signalling (Fig. 4f). Moreover, pharmacological blockade of NF-kB
activation with the IKK-b inhibitor SC-514 and inhibition of ERK
signalling with U0126 treatment both abrogated hyperinflammatory
cytokine production in Ptpn6spin mice (Supplementary Fig. 18).
Importantly, the RIP1 kinase inhibitor Nec1 also inhibited the synthesis
of Il1a transcripts (Fig. 4g), further highlighting the role of RIP1 as a
critical regulator of NF-kB-induced and IL-1a-driven autoinflamma￾tion in Ptpn6spin mice. Notably, IL-1a deletion also attenuated exacer￾bated ERK and NF-kB signalling in the footpads of Ptpn6spin mice
(Fig. 4f), suggesting that RIP1-mediated IL-1a production triggers an
inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to disease progression. In
addition to driving MAP kinase and NF-kB activation, RIP1 controls
induction of necroptosis in conjunction with RIP3 (ref. 20). To verify a
potential role for unwarranted necroptosis induction in Ptpn6spin￾associated inflammatory disease, Rip3-deficient mice were bred to
Ptpn6spin mice. However, unlike deletion of Rip1 and Il1a, genetic abla￾tion of Rip3 expression failed to protect Ptpn6spin mice from exacer￾bated inflammation in response to microabrasion-induced tissue injury
(Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 19). These results indicate that RIP3-
mediated necroptosis is dispensable, and suggest a critical rolefor RIP1-
mediated regulation ofMAP kinase and NF-kB signalling in driving the
inflammatory phenotype of Ptpn6spin mice.
Defective neutrophil homeostasis is associated with numerous devas￾tating human diseases23. For instance, neutropenia can cause severe
susceptibility to infection, whereas neutrophilia is linked to autoinflam￾matory disorders. Our results in thePtpn6spinmouseinflammationmodel
highlight a critical role for RIP1-mediated ERK and NF-kB signalling in
haematopoietic cells in driving an inflammatory circuit that triggers
excessive inflammatory responses and persistent tissue damage. Indeed,
biochemical and genetic blockade of RIP1 signalling prevented inflam￾matory cytokine production and protected Ptpn6spin mice from autoin￾flammation. IL-1a was critical for RIP1-mediated inflammatory disease
progression, which proceeded independently of inflammasome/caspase￾1-produced IL-1b and RIP3-mediated necroptosis. Consequently, thera￾peutic inhibition of RIP1 activity and/or neutralization of IL-1a may
provide novel approaches to break the self-reinforcing inflammatory
circuits that drive chronic autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
METHODS SUMMARY
Ptpn6spin mice homozygous for the Tyr208Asn amino acid substitution in the
C-terminal Src homology 2 domain of SHP-1 have been described previously3
.
Ptpn6spin mice spontaneously develop a persistent footpad disease that is charac￾terized by paw swelling and cutaneous inflammation at 8–16 weeks of age. Blood
was collected by submandibular venipuncture to measure the levels of circulating
neutrophils and inflammatory cytokines. To assess T-cell-mediated cytokine pro￾duction, splenocytes and popliteal lymph node cells were re-stimulated with PMA/
ionomycin followed by intracellular flow cytometry staining. Formalin-preserved
footpad samples were embedded in paraffin. Footpad infiltration by inflammatory
cells and neutrophils was assessed in a blinded manner by a pathologist using
haematoxylin and eosin staining and neutrophil immunohistochemistry. The
accumulation of immune cells in lymphoid organs was evaluated with the use
of flow cytometry staining. To provoke microabrasion injury, mice were anaes￾thetized and the plantar surfaces of their hind paws were irritated by gently
rubbing with sterile sandpaper. Clinical scores were assigned based on oedema,
erythema and weepy wound formation. The development of persistent footpad
swelling was used to evaluate disease incidence over time. EAE was induced using
MOG peptide, CFA, heat-inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Bordetella
pertussistoxin. Neutrophils were purified from the bone marrow and stimulated with
LPS. Fetal liver cells collected at embryonic day E14.5 were transplanted into lethally
irradiated wild-type mice to generate Ptpn6spin3Rip12/2.wild-type chimaeric mice.

METHODS
Mice. Ptpn6spin (ref. 3), Nlrp32/2 (ref. 24), Casp12/2 (ref. 24), Il1b2/2 (ref. 25),
Il1a2/2 (ref. 26), Rip32/2 (ref. 27) and Rip12/2 (ref. 21) mice were previously
described. All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions within
the Animal Resource Center at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Animal
studies were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of St Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
Histopathology. Formalin-preserved feet were processed and embedded in par￾affin according to standard procedures. Sections (5 mm) were stained with haema￾toxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined by a pathologist blinded to the experimental
groups. For immunohistochemistry, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues
were cut into 4 mm sections and slides were stained with anti-Gr-1 to stain neu￾trophils in the footpads.
Microabrasion injury model. A novel microabrasion wound model was
developed to evaluate the inflammatory response in a synchronized and controlled
fashion. In this model, wild-type and disease-free Ptpn6spin mice (4–8 weeks old)
were anaesthetized and the plantar surfaces of the hind paws were irritated by
gently rubbing with sterile sandpaper to induce physical trauma and microinjuries.
Clinical scores were assigned daily based on the following scale: 0, no disease; 1,
erythema; 2, erythema and mild swelling; 3, erythema, swelling and crusty wound
formation; 4, weepy wound formation and severe swelling. The development of
persistent footpad swelling was used to evaluate disease incidence over time. The
levels of proinflammatory mediators that are produced in response to microabra￾sion injury were measured in the serum 4–5 h after wound induction. For the in
vivo necrostatin 1 experiments, mice were given either 50 mg necrostatin 1 (Nec1)
(Sigma-Aldrich) or 50 mg of an inactive control analogue (iNec, Calbiochem) by
the intraperitoneal route 1 h before microabrasion irritation of the footpads.
Circulating cytokine levels were measured in the serum 4–5 h later.
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Age- (5–8 weeks) and
sex-matched mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 mg MOG35–55 pep￾tide (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) emulsified in CFA (Difco Laboratories)
with 500 mg Mycobacterium tuberculosis on day 0. Mice also received 200 ng
pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories) by intraperitoneal injection on days
0 and 2. Disease severity was assessed daily by assigning clinical scores according to
the following scale: 0, no disease; 1, tail paralysis; 2, weakness of hindlimbs; 3,
paralysis of hindlimbs; 4, paralysis of hindlimbs and severe hunched posture; 5,
moribund or death. To collect CNS leukocytes, mice were perfused through the left
ventricle with PBS. The spinal cord was isolated, cut into small pieces, and then
passed through a 70 mm cell strainer. Leukocytes were then purified by gradient
centrifugation using a 38% Percoll solution. Cells were washed once in PBS and
then re-suspended in media.
In vivo serum cytokines. Blood was collected by submandibular venipuncture
and allowed to clot for 30–60 min at room temperature. Serum was collected after
centrifugation and cytokines were measured by ELISA.
ELISA. Cytokine ELISA was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Millipore).
Flow cytometry and antibodies. The following monoclonal antibodies were used
for flow cytometric cell marker analysis: CD4 (L3T4), IFN-c (XMG1.2), IL-17A
(eBio17B7), MHCII (M5/114.15.2), CD11b (M1/70), CD19 (6D5), CD44 (IM7),
Ly-6G (1A8), CD25 (3C7), B220 (RA3-6B2) and Gr-1 (RB6-8C5) from
eBioscience and TCR-b (H57-597), CD8 (53-6.7), Foxp3 (FJK-16s), CD62L
(MEL-14), TNF-a (MP6-XT22), CD11c (N418), CD45.1 (A20) and CD45.2
(104) from Biolegend. Intracellular cytokine staining was done using the
eBioscience IC fixation/permeabilization kit according to the manufacturer’s pro￾tocol. Intracellular staining for the Foxp3 transcription factor was performed using
the eBioscience Foxp3 staining set according to the manufacturer’s recommenda￾tions. Flow cytometry data were acquired on an upgraded five-colour FACScan or
multi-colour LSRII (BD) and were analysed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Ex vivo lymphocyte re-stimulation. Splenocytes and lymph node (popliteal
and mesenteric) cells were collected and re-stimulated with 20 ng ml21 phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 500 ng ml21 ionomycin in the presence of
monensin for 3–4 h. Cells were stained according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions (eBioscience). For the EAE experiment, splenocytes were harvested and re￾stimulated with 30 mg ml21 MOG peptide. Supernatants were collected after 48 h
to measure cytokine levels by ELISA.
Bone marrow chimaeras. Bone marrow was flushed from the femurs and filtered
through a 40 mm filter. 3–5 3 106 cells in 200 ml PBS were transferred by tail vein
injection into lethally irradiated (1,000 rad) mice. Congenic CD45 markers were
used to verify chimaerism.
In vitro macrophage stimulation. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) were generated by culturing bone marrow cells in L-cell-conditioned
IMDM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acid, and
1% penicillin-streptomycin for 5 days. BMDMs were seeded in 12-well cell culture
plates and cultured overnight. To evaluate cytokine production, BMDMs were
primed with 2 mg ml21 ultrapure Escherichia coli-derived LPS (Invivogen) for 3 h
followed by 5 mM ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) for an additional 30 min. BMDMs were
also separately stimulated with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (5
MOI) for 4 h and supernatants were collected to evaluate cytokine secretion by
ELISA.
Neutrophil culture and in vitro stimulation. Bone marrow cells were isolated
from the femurs of mice and neutrophils (CD11b1 Gr-11) were purified by flow
cytometry sorting. Neutrophils (1 3 106 cells ml21
) were stimulated with 100 ng
ml21 ultrapure Escherichia coli-derived LPS (Invivogen). Supernatants were col￾lected after 48 h of stimulation and cytokine levels were measured by ELISA.
Western blotting. Footpad protein lysates were collected in RIPA lysis buffer
supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and PhosSTOP
(Roche) using a tissue homogenizer. Samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes via electroblotting.
Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk and incubated overnight at 4 uC
with primary antibodies. The membranes were then probed with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-tagged secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h.
Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL method (Pierce).
Real-time RT–PCR. Total RNA was isolated from the hind paws with Trizol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 mg of RNA was
reverse-transcribed to cDNA with random RNA-specific primers using the
high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Transcript
levels of Il1a and Gapdh were analysed using SYBR-Green (Applied Biosystems)
on an ABI7500 real-time PCR machine according to the manufacturers’ recom￾mendations. Relative expression was calculated using the DDCt standardization
method.
Footpad pathology scoring. Footpad haematoxylin and eosin sections were
scored based on the extent and severity of inflammation, ulceration and hyper￾plasia of the mucosa in a blinded fashion by a veterinary pathologist. Severity
scores for inflammation were as follows: 0, normal (within normal limits); 1,
minimal (small, focal, or widely separated); 2, mild; 3, moderate (moderate multi￾focal inflammation with dermatitis, suppurative, coalescing with intraepithelial
and follicular abscesses); 4, marked (marked inflammation, with intraepidermal
pustules, epidermal hyperplasia, acantholysis, dermatitis, perifolliculitis); 5, severe
(severe inflammation, with intraepidermal pustules, epidermal hyperplasia,
acantholysis, dermatitis, perifolliculitis, lesions covering .50% of the section).
APAP-induced hepatotoxicity model.Acetaminophen (Sigma-Aldrich) was dis￾solved in sterile PBS by heating the solution to 55 uC. Mice that fasted overnight for
16–18 h received 250 mg kg21 of acetaminophen (APAP) by intraperitoneal injec￾tion. Mice were harvested 18–20 h after injection and the levels of serum alanine
aminotransferase (sALT) were measured in the blood by ELISA.
Statistical analysis. All results are presented as means 6 standard errors. We
performed statistical analysis using the two-tailed Student’s t-test. Differences
were considered statistically significant when P , 0.05. P values are denoted by
*P , 0.05, **P , 0.01, ***P , 0.001.
