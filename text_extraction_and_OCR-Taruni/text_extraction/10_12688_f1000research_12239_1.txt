Abstract
Introduction: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common primary
malignant liver neoplasm in children. Its increasing survival rate is
related to the progress in modern imaging, surgical techniques, and
new chemotherapy regimens.
Clinical approach: One of the past achievements was the
development of the pretreatment extension of disease (PRETEXT)
system. Gradually, the HB therapeutic approach has become more
individualized with better stratification of patients.
Controversies: These include the need for preoperative
chemotherapy and its optimal duration; intensity of preoperative
chemotherapy required for locally advanced cases (PRETEXT 4);
optimal surgical treatment for locally advanced tumors: aggressive
hepatic resections versus liver transplantation; the role of
postoperative chemotherapy in the post-transplant setting; the timing
and role of metastasectomy in patients with disseminated disease
who undergo partial liver resection; and the prognostic significance of
several HB pathology variants.
Hepatoblastoma biology: Beta-catenin mutations and the beta￾catenin/Wnt pathway play an important role in HB development.
There have been at least two molecular signatures in HB published.
Unluckily, all of these findings are based on relatively small clinical
series and require confirmation.
Conclusion: The treatment of HB started from one and the same
therapy for all patients and aimed at increased treatment
individualization, but the future seems to lie in biology-driven patient￾tailored therapies.

Introduction
Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common primary malignant 
liver neoplasm in children1
. In the vast majority of cases, it 
is associated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is 
helpful in diagnosis and monitoring response to treatment as well 
as the follow-up. In the modern era, HB is associated with very 
good survival, in the range of 70–80%, although before the 
introduction of chemotherapy (CHT) it was below 30%2
. This 
is related to the progress in modern imaging, surgical tech￾niques including liver transplantation (LTX), and efficient CHT 
regimens3,4
.
Clinical approach
It seems that CHT progress was associated with its intensifi￾cation and the introduction of the more time-frequent use of 
cisplatin, which supposedly is the key drug in HB5
. However, 
not all patients do equally well. Metastatic cases, especially HBs 
associated with low AFP levels (<100 ng/mL), are associated 
with decreased survival. Particularly the latter subgroup has 
a truly dismal outcome6
. Furthermore, doxorubicin is a very 
important drug in HB treatment, especially in advanced-stage 
patients. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) found that a 
platinum-alone regimen for stage III and IV patients was 
associated with significantly increased failure rate and there￾fore was substituted with a regimen including doxorubicin which 
brought very good outcomes, especially in stage III patients. 
However, it is possible that this observation resulted from the 
fact that in the quoted regimen cisplatin was de facto deintensi￾fied because of its partial substitution with carboplatin, which 
seems to be less active. Nevertheless, the International Childhood 
Liver Tumours Study Group (SIOPEL group) also includes 
doxorubicin as an integral part of treatment for patients at very 
high risk7
.
Several issues, especially of prognostic significance, have 
recently been clarified by the efforts of the Children’s Hepatic 
tumors International Cooperation (CHIC) group1
. The CHIC 
group has developed an international clinical database collect￾ing 1,605 HB cases treated in prospective multicenter trials 
under the auspices of the American COG, the Japanese Pediatric 
Liver Tumours study group (JPLT), and the European SIOPEL 
group. Several key factors, which were considered doubtful (that 
is, tumor rupture at diagnosis, vascular invasion, and multifocal￾ity), have been proven to affect patient survival. Although the 
highest incidence of HB occurs in children younger than 5 years 
old, HB cases in older children have been published. The influ￾ence of older age at diagnosis on treatment outcome and tumor 
histology in HB has not been well studied. However, it seems 
from the CHIC effort that older HB patients do much worse, but 
the reason for this is not entirely clear. It is possible that this is 
associated with different histology/biology of the tumor as well 
as its different response to standard therapy8,9
.
Another achievement of the SIOPEL group was the development 
of the PRETEXT system, which served to assess pretreatment 
extension of disease within the liver. Subsequently, it became an 
accepted worldwide standard10,11.
Gradually, the HB therapeutic approach has become more 
individualized with better patient stratification based upon initial 
clinical features. Although initially all HBs were treated in the 
same way, later at least two new patient categories emerged:
1. Standard-risk HB, which is entirely limited to the liver but 
leaving at least one of its four sections free (that is, involving no 
more than three out of four of its sections, thus being potentially 
resectable) and associated with elevated AFP levels (>100 ng/mL).
2. High-risk HB, which is metastatic or involving the whole 
liver (PRETEXT 4 tumors) or has extrahepatic/vascular extension 
or is associated with low AFP or a combination of these factors.
Controversies
Nevertheless, several areas of controversy persist. This applies 
mainly to the following:
1. The need for preoperative CHT and its optimal duration. Owing 
to differences between the European approach, which tends to 
rely on preoperative CHT in every case, and the American one, 
which favors primary tumor resection, it is unclear what the best 
indications for preoperative CHT are and what the optimal number 
of courses is. Both approaches resulted in similar outcome. The 
recently proven improvement in survival of metastatic cases 
based upon SIOPEL 4 intensified cisplatin approach5
. However, 
it seems that, in most cases, standard cisplatin monotherapy is 
sufficient, and this was convincingly proven by the SIOPEL 3 
study12. This controversy may be resolved by a new Pediatric 
Hepatic Malignancy International Therapeutic Trial (PHITT), 
which is organized jointly by COG, JPLT, and SIOPEL, combin￾ing experiences and past approaches. In this study, two versus 
four courses of preoperative CHT will be compared in standard￾risk HB.
2. Intensity of preoperative CHT required for locally advanced 
cases (PRETEXT 4). It is unclear whether, in PRETEXT 4 
tumors, more intense preoperative CHT makes sense since many 
of them will require LTX anyhow and hence toxic effects of 
aggressive CHT might be better avoided. On the other hand, it 
is known from the previous studies that about 30–50% of such 
tumors can be downstaged because of CHT and eventually undergo 
partial hepatectomy instead of LTX11.
3. Optimal surgical treatment for locally advanced tumors: 
aggressive hepatic resections versus LTX. It is clear from the 
basic study by Otte et al. that salvage LTX in HB (for example,
performed for local relapse or incomplete previous tumor 
resection) is associated with significantly inferior survival when 
compared with primary LTX (70% versus less than 30%)12. This 
observation became a cornerstone to favor LTX over aggressive
liver resections. However, one must remember that despite 
good short- and medium-term results, LTX is not free from its 
own co-morbidities such as secondary neoplasms and the 
lifelong (at least in the majority of cases) need for immunosup￾pression with all its potential negative side effects and conse￾quences. Additionally, recently published SIOPEL observations
Page 3 of 7
F1000Research 2018, 7(F1000 Faculty Rev):53 Last updated: 14 NOV 2024

have shown that microscopic residuum in HB is not associated 
with decreased patient survival13. Again, the PHITT may help to 
answer this question in the future, although it may be difficult 
because of the partially subjective and surgeon-dependent nature 
of the tumor’s resectability assessment.
4. The role of postoperative CHT in the post-transplant setting. 
At the moment, there is no clear policy and evidence base 
regarding this aspect. Several studies documented equally good 
results regardless of whether subsequent CHT was used after 
transplant14–16. There is certainly a fear that CHT may contribute 
to an increased risk of LTX complications. Nevertheless, it seems 
that nowadays most transplant centers tend to favor the use of 
postoperative CHT.
5. The timing and role of metastasectomy in patients with 
disseminated disease who undergo partial liver resection. Modern
CHT is very successful in the eradication of lung metastases 
in HB patients; a 90% response rate was observed in the recent 
SIOPEL 4 study. Traditionally, in the LTX setting, pulmo￾nary metastases, which persisted after induction CHT, had to be 
resected before LTX4
. However, in patients who underwent 
partial liver resection, a different policy was used: pulmonary 
metastasectomy followed hepatectomy and usually was preceded 
by one or two CHT courses. This approach resulted from two 
facts: a fear that hepatic growth factors are excreted in the 
regeneration process after hepatectomy which may contribute 
to the development/growth of lung metastases and a chance for 
complete regression of metastases in the course of postoperative 
CHT17. This issue has never been properly studied and remains 
unresolved.
6. There are also some remaining controversies over whether 
CHT alone is sufficient for the clearance of pulmonary metas￾tases in patients undergoing LTX. Some surgeons still require 
surgical exploration of those patients to prove that they have no 
viable HB deposits in their lungs before undergoing a transplant.
7. Treatment for the refractory or relapsed patients is also far 
from being standardized, and several regimens, including irinote￾can alone, vincristine/irinotecan, gemcitabine/oxaliplatin, and 
docetaxel monotherapy, have been tested. This is somewhat 
dependent on the first line of therapy. If a patient was treated with 
cisplatin alone, then carboplatin/doxorubicin as the second line 
may be a very successful and reasonable option.
8. Prognostic significance of several HB pathology variants. In the 
past, several HB variants have been postulated to be associated 
with inferior survival of patients (that is, microtrabecular or 
anaplastic variant)18,19. On the contrary, pure fetal well￾differentiated HB (PF-HB) was associated with very good sur￾vival which was proven in subsequent COG studies. In the North 
American trials, there have been no recurrences observed in 
PF-HB patients treated with surgery alone20,21. Some researchers
postulated prognostic significance of percentage of tumor 
necrosis in the resected tumor, which can be predictive for the 
outcome; however, these findings have never been confirmed in 
larger series. According to Venkatramani et al., patients who had 
at least 30% necrosis in the resected tumor had a better event￾free survival compared with the group having less than 30% 
necrosis22. Owing to previous differences in pathology HB clas￾sifications between various international study groups, the issue 
of prognostic pathology subtype significance was very diffi￾cult to study, even using the CHIC approach. However, after the 
development and publication of a new international classifica￾tion of pediatric liver tumors, that effort is underway23. Currently, 
all CHIC database patients for whom pathology material was 
available and could be scanned and digitalized are being 
re-reviewed by the international CHIC pathology committee. 
This analysis should be finished by the end of the year.
Hepatoblastoma biology
Owing to huge progress in basic and translation research, our 
understanding of HB biology has improved greatly. There has 
been a continual search for possible molecular prognostic factors 
that may help in the diagnosis and treatment of this neoplasm. 
However, correlation between biology and pathology remains 
unclear. Two main histological types of HB occur: epithe￾lial and mixed epithelial/mesenchymal. The epithelial type is 
further divided into subtypes, such as fetal, embryonal, com￾bined fetal and embryonal or macrotrabecular and small 
cell type. The mixed type is characterized by the presence 
of some extra-mesenchymal elements, such as cartilage or 
osteoid24,25. Histological differences between various subgroups 
of HB, as well as the fact that 40% of tumor samples contain 
both epithelial and mesenchymal elements, may be explained by 
the cellular basis of this neoplasm. HB arises not only from pri￾mary hepatoblasts but also from less differentiated cells. Hepatic 
stem cells and human fetal liver multipotent progenitor cells 
(hFLMPCs), which are poorly differentiated, are able to convert 
into a variety of tissues, such as hepatocytes, bone, fat, or bile 
ducts. Thus, a suspected origin of HB from hFLMPCs may explain 
its variety26.
It is widely known that beta-catenin plays a crucial role in the 
development of various human organs. According to the newest
research, it seems that beta-catenin mutations and the beta￾catenin/Wnt pathway play an important role in HB development. 
According to research by Tan et al. in a murine model, where 
the CTNNB1 was knocked out, partial hepatectomy leads to 
hepatocyte proliferation and hepatic cell growth27. Activation of 
beta-catenin, in a physiological context, is mainly regulated by 
the Wnt pathway28. Its abnormalities collectively account for most 
of the genetic defects in HB. In addition, the accumulation of 
beta-catenin is observed in almost all HB cases. The new 
cooperative role of beta-catenin signaling and Yap signaling in 
HB pathogenesis should be included in future studies as well. 
Tao et al., in their research in mice, showed that overexpression 
of activated forms of the above proteins leads to rapid tumor

development. Moreover, it seems that the results of their study 
may identify new potential therapeutic targets29.
There have also been at least two molecular signatures in HB 
published30,31. Unluckily, all of these findings are based on 
relatively small clinical series and require confirmation, which 
again may come through the biological part of the PHITT.
Conclusions
The story of the treatment of HB has been a fascinating 
journey starting from one and the same therapy for all patients 
and aiming at increased treatment individualization, but the 
future seems to lie in biology-driven patient-tailored therapies.
