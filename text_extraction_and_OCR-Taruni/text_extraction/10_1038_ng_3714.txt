1 Abstract 
2
3 Insulin resistance is a key mediator of obesity-related cardiometabolic disease, yet the 
4 mechanisms underlying this link remain obscure. Using an integrative genomic approach, we 
5 identify 53 genomic regions associated with insulin resistance phenotypes (higher fasting 
6 insulin adjusted for BMI, lower HDL cholesterol and higher triglycerides) and provide 
7 evidence that their link with higher cardiometabolic risk is underpinned by an association with 
8 lower adipose mass in peripheral compartments. Using these 53 loci, we show a polygenic 
9 contribution to familial partial lipodystrophy-type 1, a severe form of insulin resistance, and 
10 highlight shared molecular mechanisms between common/mild and rare/severe insulin 
11 resistance. Population-level genetic analyses combined with experiments in cellular models 
12 implicate CCDC92, DNAH10 and L3MBTL3 as previously unrecognised molecules 
13 influencing adipocyte differentiation. Our findings support the notion that limited storage 
14 capacity of peripheral adipose tissue is an important aetiological component in insulin-resistant 
15 cardiometabolic disease and highlight genes and mechanisms underpinning this link.

1 Introduction 
2
3 Insulin resistance, usually defined as an impaired ability of insulin to maintain normal 
4 glucose metabolism and initially manifested by higher levels of circulating insulin, is positively 
5 associated with adiposity and is a key mediator of the link between obesity and its adverse 
impact on metabolic and cardiovascular disease.1-8 6 Given the current global epidemic of 
7 metabolic disease, there is an urgent need for improved understanding of the mechanisms that 
link over-nutrition to insulin resistance in the general population.7-10 8 
9 Among individuals stratified on the basis of overall adiposity, there is considerable 
variation in the extent of adverse metabolic sequelae,11 10 demonstrating the importance of other 
11 factors in the aetiology of insulin resistance and its complications. Indeed, while insulin 
12 resistance often coexists with obesity, severe forms of insulin resistance develop without 
13 obesity or in association with generalized or regional lack of adipose tissue, i.e. 
lipodystrophy.12 In lipodystrophies,13 14 it has been proposed that the impaired capacity of 
15 peripheral adipose tissue to expand under the challenge of a positive energy balance leads to 
16 lipid accumulation at ectopic sites (e.g. liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas) and eventually to overt 
diabetes.12,14 The notion of “adipose overflow” or “limited adipose tissue expandability”15-19 17 is 
18 supported (i) by the metabolic disturbances seen in rare, monogenic lipodystrophies and their 
dramatic amelioration in response to dietary calorie restriction20 or leptin replacement,21,22 19 and 
20 (ii) by a series of elegant rodent studies including those in which adipose tissue capacity was 
expanded by fat transplantation in lipodystrophic mice23 or by over-expressing adiponectin,24 21
22 or where partially lipodystrophic mice were energetically challenged by rendering them leptin 
deficient.25,26 23 However, the relevance of this model to the general population remains uncertain. 
24 Some initial human genetic insights into more prevalent forms of insulin resistance are 
25 available. Genome-wide studies of gold-standard measures of insulin resistance have been 
limited by sample size,27 26 but multiple genomic loci have been associated with fasting insulin 

4
levels, a widely-measured marker of insulin resistance.28,29 1 A subset of these loci were 
associated with higher triglycerides and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,28 2
which are hallmarks of insulin resistance.13,30 3 These loci were later validated for their 
association with insulin resistance,31 4 suggesting that the combined association with this triad 
5 of phenotypes could help identify specific genetic determinants of insulin resistance. 
6 Given the availability of large-scale genome-wide association data on lipid traits and 
fasting insulin,28,29,32 7 we undertook an integrative genomic approach to characterise genetic and 
8 molecular mechanisms underpinning insulin resistance at a given level of adiposity and its role 
9 in cardiometabolic disease in the general population.

1 Results 
2 Associations with insulin resistance phenotypes at 53 independent genomic regions 
3 We combined genome-wide association results for fasting insulin adjusted for body mass 
index,22,23 HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels32 4 from up to 188,577 individuals to identify 
5 loci associated with a phenotypic pattern indicative of insulin resistance (Online Methods, 
6 Supplementary Figures 1-2 and Supplementary Table 1). After aligning the association 
7 results of ~2.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the insulin-raising allele, 
8 630 SNPs from 53 1Mb-genomic regions were associated with higher fasting insulin, higher 
9 triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol (p<0.005 for each phenotype, expected probability of 
association under null hypothesis p=3.1 x 10-08 10 ; Online Methods, Supplementary Figures 3-
4). These 53 genomic regions included 10 loci previously implicated in insulin resistance,31 11
12 and an additional 43 loci (Supplementary Table 2). A subset of 25 of the 53 loci had 
13 previously been associated with HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels at genome-wide 
significance,32 14 while 28 had not (Supplementary Table 2). We first investigated the 
15 associations of these loci in a completely independent sample of 6,101 individuals and found 
16 that genetic risk scores comprising the 53 lead SNPs were strongly associated with higher 
17 fasting insulin, higher triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol (Supplementary Figure 5). 
18 We next asked whether these variants were associated with “gold-standard” measures of insulin 
19 sensitivity. Having a greater number of risk-alleles from the 53-SNP, 43-SNP or 28-SNP 
20 (excluding loci previously implicated in insulin resistance and lipid traits, respectively) genetic 
21 scores was strongly associated with (a) lower insulin sensitivity measured by euglycemic clamp 
or insulin suppression test in 2,764 individuals27 (p-value for 53-SNP genetic score = 4.3 x 10- 22
06 23 ; Table 1) and (b) lower insulin sensitivity index in 4,769 individuals with a frequently￾sampled oral glucose tolerance test33 (p-value for 53-SNP genetic score = 7.3 x 10-10 24 ; Table 
25 1).

1 Genetic predisposition to insulin resistance via the 53 loci confers higher risk of 
2 cardiometabolic disease but lower levels of peripheral adiposity 
3 We next investigated associations of the 53 genomic regions with a range of continuous 
4 metabolic traits and disease outcomes. In 45,836 cases and 230,358 controls, the 53-SNP 
5 genetic score was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] per standard 
6 deviation [SD] of the genetic score [i.e. ~4.5 alleles], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-
1.14; p=9.2 x 10-61 7 ; Table 1). In studies with available individual-level data, we saw no 
8 difference in associations across sex or body mass index (BMI) strata (Supplementary Table 
9 3). Genetically-predicted insulin resistance was also associated with a higher risk of coronary 
heart disease (Table 1). The associations with type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.10; p=9.0 x 10-32 10 ) and 
coronary heart disease (OR, 1.04; p=9.7 x 10-07 11 ) remained after removing 13 loci that were 
12 previously shown to be associated with either of the two diseases at genome-wide 
significance.34,35 13 Association estimates were also consistent after removing the 25 loci 
14 previously associated with HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels at genome-wide significance 
15 (Table 1). We also observed an association with coronary heart disease in 5,369 cases of 
16 coronary heart disease and 106,969 controls from the UK Biobank study not previously 
included in genome-wide discovery analyses of insulin or lipid traits (OR, 1.09; p=5.3 x 10-09 17 ). 
18 Individually, 30 of the 53 lead SNPs were associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk (p<0.05; 
19 Supplementary Table 4), including a novel association at genome-wide significance for 
rs718314 near ITPR2 (OR per allele, 1.06; p=6.8 x 10-09 20 ). We found an enrichment of loci 
21 associated with higher risk of both type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, including those 
22 encompassing the proximal insulin signalling INSR, IRS1 and PIK3R1 genes (11/53 loci 
23 associated with both diseases at p<0.05; two-tailed binomial probability of observing this 
proportion of loci by chance p=8.5 x 10-22 24 ; Supplementary Table 5). 

7
1 While insulin resistance is often considered secondary to higher adiposity, at the 53 loci 
2 we observed associations with lower body fat percentage, BMI and hip circumference (Figure 
3 1A, Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). The larger magnitude of association with measures of 
4 body fat rather than with glycaemic phenotypes is consistent with a primary effect of many 
5 variants on adipose tissue mass (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). 
6 By follow-up studies using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measures in 
7 12,848 individuals, we found that the most marked association of the genetic score was with 
8 lower levels of gynoid and leg fat mass (Figure 1B). Individuals in the highest quintile of the 
9 53-SNP genetic score had an average of 712 grams less leg fat mass compared to individuals 
10 in the bottom quintile (Figure 1C), which accounted for the majority of the overall body fat 
11 association (Supplementary Figure 8). The association with lower levels of leg fat was 
12 accompanied by a higher hazard of incident type 2 diabetes (Figure 1C). In 9,150 participants 
13 from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort who gained weight during a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 
14 carrying a greater number of the 53 risk alleles was inversely associated with change in hip 
15 circumference, adjusted for the amount of weight gained (i.e. individuals carrying more alleles 
16 were less likely to deposit extra mass in their gluteal region for a given increase in body mass; 
17 β in cm of hip circumference per SD of genetic score, -0.07; p=0.027; Supplementary Note). 
18 Overall, these association analyses suggest that individuals genetically predisposed to insulin 
19 resistance via the 53 loci have a relative inability to expand their peripheral fat compartment 
20 when challenged by a positive energy balance and that this incapacity results in higher 
21 cardiometabolic disease risk. We also found that the 53-SNP genetic score was associated with 
22 higher levels of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase (Supplementary 
23 Table 6), which suggests that the failure to store lipid in gluteofemoral adipose tissue may be 
24 accompanied by hepatic lipid deposition. 

8
1 The 53-SNP genetic score was associated with greater waist circumference (Figure 1A), 
2 but not with trunk adipose tissue (Figure 1B), indicating that the association with body fat 
3 distribution and cardiometabolic disease was largely driven by the association with lower levels 
4 of peripheral adipose tissue (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures 6-8). Among the 53 lead 
SNPs, 17 were within 500kb of a waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) associated SNP36 5 (Supplementary 
6 Figure 6). Consistent with DEXA analyses, the associations with WHR at this subset of 
7 overlapping loci were largely driven by an association with lower hip circumference, rather 
8 than higher waist circumference (Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 4). 
9 Our large-scale meta-analyses allowed the investigation of individual-SNP associations 
10 with both adiposity and metabolic risk. At eight of the 53 loci, the lead SNP was associated 
11 with lower total body fat percentage or hip circumference at genome-wide significance (p<5 x 
10-08 12 ), including a novel association of the insulin-raising G allele of rs4976033 near PIK3R1
with lower body fat percentage (p=3.0 x 10-09 13 ; see Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 9). 
14 Seven of the eight adiposity-lowering alleles at these loci were associated with a higher risk of 
15 type 2 diabetes (p<0.05; Figure 1D). 
16
17 Role of common variants in the genetic basis of a severe form of lipodystrophy 
18 Given the strong association with insulin resistance but lower levels of peripheral 
19 adiposity, we hypothesized that the polygenic predisposition to insulin resistance imparted by 
20 the 53 loci might contribute to the pathogenesis of familial partial lipodystrophy-type 1 
21 (FPLD1). When compared to women from the population-based Fenland study, women 
22 diagnosed with FPLD1 displayed markedly lower levels of leg fat mass for a given fat mass in 
23 the rest of the body (Figure 2A). Whilst the name of the condition implies Mendelian 
24 inheritance, using exome sequencing in 9 FPLD1 cases we did not identify likely candidate 
25 causal genes (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 7). When compared with 5,296 

9
1 unrelated women from the UKHLS study in a case-control analysis, 37 patients with FPLD1 
2 had a higher burden of the 53 risk alleles (OR per SD of genetic score in logistic regression 
3 analyses adjusted for age and the first 10 genetic principal components, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-
4 2.39; p=0.0021, Figure 2B; ppermutation=0.0020, see Online Methods). Also, the phenotypes 
5 observed in FPLD1 patients in comparison to obese women from the Fenland study mirrored 
6 the association pattern of the 53-SNP genetic score (Supplementary Table 8). FPLD1 women 
7 had a more severe leg fat phenotype compared to that expected from the relationship between 
8 the 53 SNP score and leg fat mass in the Fenland study (Figure 2C), suggesting that additional 
9 genetic and environmental factors contribute to determining this extreme phenotype. 
10
11 Prioritisation of putative effector genes, cell-types and tissues 
12 We prioritised putative effector genes at the 53 loci by integrating data about physical 
13 proximity, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, functional annotation and 
14 previous knowledge about genes causing monogenic forms of insulin resistance (summarised 
15 in Supplementary Table 2; see also Supplementary Tables 9-11 for details). Putative 
16 effector genes included five with well-established roles in proximal insulin signalling 
17 (Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 3A). Other candidates included LPL, encoding the key 
18 lipolysis regulator lipoprotein lipase (Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 3B). The insulin￾lowering, minor allele of rs1011685 (near LPL) is on the same haplotype (r2 19 =1) as a gain-of￾function,37 20 protein-truncating allele in LPL (p.Ser447*; rs328; minor-allele frequency [MAF], 
21 9.9%). The p.Ser447* gain-of-function variant was recently reported to be associated with 
lower risk of coronary heart disease,38 22 while an independent loss-of-function missense variant 
of LPL39 (p.Asp36Asn; rs1801177; MAF, 1.9%) was associated with higher risk.38 23 Here, we 
24 found that the p.Ser447* gain-of-function variant is associated with greater insulin sensitivity, 
25 lower fasting glucose, lower levels of liver markers and protection from type 2 diabetes (OR 

10
per allele, 0.93; p=1.6 x 10-05 1 ; Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 10). Conversely, the 
2 p.Asp36Asn loss-of-function variant in LPL is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes 
3 (OR per allele, 1.11; p=0.0086; Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 10). Thus, recent 
4 findings of an allelic series of LPL variants implicating lipoprotein lipase as a putative 
therapeutic target in heart disease38 5 are now complemented by a directionally consistent 
6 observation for type 2 diabetes, compatible with a role for impaired lipoprotein lipase-mediated 
7 lipolysis in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. 
8 Among the 53 loci, three contained genes at which rare mutations have been previously 
9 implicated in severe monogenic forms of insulin resistance (i.e. PPARG, PIK3R1, INSR; 
10 Figure 3C), which is more than what expected by chance given the prevalence of monogenic 
11 insulin resistance genes in the genome (observed percentage 0.54% [3 out of a total of 553 
12 genes in the 53 loci], expected percentage 0.064%, two-tailed binomial p=0.0056). The PIK3R1
13 gene encodes regulatory subunits of a critical kinase involved in proximal insulin signalling 
14 and rare, loss-of-function mutations in this gene are associated with SHORT syndrome, a 
15 dysmorphic condition characterised by short stature, partial lipodystrophy and insulin 
resistance.40-43 16 To date, such mutations have been identified in few families worldwide and 
17 data from Exome Aggregation Consortium show this gene to have decreased tolerance of 
18 missense variation (Z=2.42) and to be particularly intolerant of loss-of-function mutations 
19 (pLI=1; Exome Aggregation Consortium, Cambridge, MA, URL: 
http://exac.broadinstitute.org accessed 22 20 nd March 2016). Here, we provide evidence that a 
21 common variant near PIK3R1, which accounts for almost half of all alleles in the general 
22 population (MAF=49%), is associated with subtle effects on insulin resistance, lower body fat 
23 percentage, higher risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (Supplementary Figure 
24 9). This association pattern partially overlaps with that reported for PIK3R1 mutations and 
25 SHORT syndrome (Supplementary Table 12). We also found that the common rs8101064 

11
1 allele T in INSR, encoding the insulin receptor, was associated with insulin resistance and 
2 higher risk of type 2 diabetes (OR per allele, 1.08; p=0.020), but not with body fat percentage 
3 (p=0.16), consistent with the fact that patients with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in 
the INSR are frequently insulin resistant but are not commonly lipodystrophic.13 4
 We assessed the overlap of lead SNPs and their proxies (r2 5 >0.8) with functional 
6 regulatory annotations across 98 cell types from the NIH Epigenome Roadmap (Online 
7 Methods) and, consistent with phenotypic associations, identified substantial overlap with 
8 adipose tissue active enhancer elements (31 of 53 loci overlapped adipose tissue active 
9 enhancer elements; observed percentage=58.4% of loci, expected=30.1%, binomial p=2.1 x 
10-05 10 ; Online Methods and Figure 3D). Furthermore, combined pathway analyses with 
integration of large-scale gene expression data44 11 implicated adipocytes as likely effector cell￾12 type underlying observed associations (Figure 3E). In subcutaneous adipocyte eQTL data from 
13 1,064 individuals of the EUROBATS and GTex projects (Online Methods and 
14 Supplementary Table 10), we observed evidence of eQTL associations with nearby genes 
(p<10-06 15 ) at 21 loci including 14 with supportive evidence of co-localisation of lead phenotypic 
16 and eQTL associations (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 10). 
17
18 Experimental validation of putative effector genes in cellular adipogenesis models 
19 We sought to experimentally validate the role of five putative effector genes (IRS1, 
20 CCDC92, DNAH10, L3MBTL3 and FAM13A) across four loci which showed associations with 
21 (a) expression of nearby transcripts in subcutaneous adipocytes, (b) lower peripheral adiposity 
22 and (c) higher metabolic disease risk (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Figure 11, 
23 Supplementary Tables 10 and 13). We used short interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce mRNA 
24 levels for these five genes in OP9-K cells, an adipocyte model which shows rapid 
differentiation in response to adipogenic stimuli.45 25 Knockdown of the IRS1, CCDC92,

12
1 DNAH10 and L3MBTL3 genes significantly reduced both mRNA of the target gene (Figure 
2 4A top graph) and lipid accumulation (Figure 4A bottom graph and Figure 4B). These results 
3 were directionally consistent with the association of the insulin-raising alleles at these loci with 
4 lower expression of these genes in subcutaneous adipocytes and with lower levels of peripheral 
5 fat (Figure 4C). Knockdown of FAM13A reduced mRNA (Figure 4A top graph), but did not 
6 significantly affect pre-adipocyte lipid accumulation (Figure 4A bottom graph and Figure 4B). 
7 In contrast to the other four genes, the risk allele at FAM13A was associated with higher mRNA 
8 expression of this gene in subcutaneous adipocytes (Figure 4C). 

13
1 Discussion 
2 Our data implicate the impaired capacity to adequately expand the peripheral adipose 
3 tissue compartments in human insulin resistance and related disease at the population level. 
These results substantially augment existing evidence31,36,46-49 4 by clarifying the extent and 
5 relevance of adipose tissue dysfunction to cardiometabolic disease and by providing novel 
6 mechanistic insights into its underpinning biology. 
7 Our results are consistent with the existence of dozens of genomic regions at which 
8 common genetic variation affects cardiometabolic disease risk via subtle “lipodystrophy-like” 
9 mechanisms. While these common genetic mechanisms have individually small effects, their 
10 cumulative effect is large and relevant to a large fraction of the population. For instance, we 
11 observed ~700 grams difference in leg fat mass between the top and bottom 20% of the 
12 population distribution of risk alleles. We also show a polygenic contribution to an extreme 
13 phenotype, referred to as FPLD1 or Köbberling-type lipodystrophy, illustrating the 
14 contribution of common alleles to severe forms of insulin resistance. At given loci (e.g. 
15 PIK3R1), we found that genetic variants at the two extremes of the allele frequency spectrum 
16 result in corresponding consequences at the extremes of the phenotypic severity spectrum. 
17 These findings strongly concur with the notion that molecular and pathophysiologic 
18 mechanisms first described in severe forms of lipodystrophic insulin resistance are relevant to 
19 the general population. While a centripetal distribution of body fat is a well-recognised risk 
factor for metabolic and cardiovascular disease,50-54 20 there is considerable confusion about the 
21 underlying mechanisms and relative importance of lower peripheral fat versus higher central 
22 adiposity. Whilst supportive of a role for central fat accumulation, different lines of evidence 
23 from this study suggest a role for impaired peripheral fat deposition in insulin-resistant 
24 cardiometabolic disease in the general population. These include strong associations with 
25 gluteo-femoral adiposity, overlap with regulatory regions in adipose tissue and with genomic 

14
1 loci known to cause lipodystrophies, as well as functional characterisation in adipocytes. These 
2 findings provide evidence from large-scale human genetics studies which add to a body of 
3 research about the links between subcutaneous and lower-body adipocyte phenotypes and a 
favourable metabolic profile.19,55-57 4 
5 By combining population-scale association studies with eQTL data from adipose tissue 
6 and experimental evidence from murine cellular models, we provide evidence that specific risk 
7 loci influence adipose gene expression resulting in impaired adipogenesis, reduced peripheral 
8 fat depots and ultimately increased cardiometabolic disease risk. For the L3MBTL3, DNAH10
9 or CCDC92 genes, evidence presented in this study provides the first link with impaired 
10 adipocyte differentiation capacity. L3MBTL3 recognises methylated lysine residues on histone 
tails58 11 and previous genome-wide anthropometric studies have implicated this locus in adult 
height and length at birth.59-61 12 At the chromosome 12q24 locus, our analyses are consistent 
13 with the implication of both CCDC92 and DNAH10 in impaired adipogenesis. CCDC92 is a 
coiled coil domain protein which interacts with proteins in the centriole/ciliary interface.62 14
15 DNAH10 encodes one of the heavy chains of the dynein arms of the motile cilia and it is, 
16 therefore, surprising that its product appears to have cell autonomous effects on adipocyte 
17 biology. However, an essential splice site mutation in DNAH10 has previously been reported 
to co-segregate with abnormal circulating HDL-cholesterol levels in a family,63 18 while the locus 
19 containing both CCDC92 and DNAH10 has been associated with circulating levels of large 
HDL particles,64 20 further supporting an unexpected role for these proteins in metabolism. 
21 Our results have preventive and therapeutic implications for cardiovascular and metabolic 
22 disease. First, they suggest that attempts to develop pharmacological agents acting on the 
23 molecular mechanisms of obesity are likely to reduce cardiometabolic risk if they reduce 
24 calorie intake (e.g. by acting on appetite) or reduce ectopic fat deposition in tissues such as the 
25 liver, muscle and pancreas, but not if they impair adipogenesis or peripheral fat deposition. 

15
1 Agents that promote adipocyte differentiation and increase peripheral adipose mass via action 
2 on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma have powerful antidiabetic 
actions,65,66 and in some cases have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes,67,68 3
4 although some of these agents have been reported to have an adverse cardiovascular safety 
profile.69 5 An early but vital challenge in the translation of genetic findings towards therapeutic 
6 insight is the ability to identify likely effector transcripts underlying genetic associations. In 
7 the current study, we identify putative effectors of genetic associations and the tissues in which 
8 they operate. We also demonstrate that these genetic variants often affect the risk of type 2 
9 diabetes and coronary disease in a consistent direction, which suggests that targeting these 
10 pathways may satisfy current regulatory requirements that anti-diabetic agents should not be 
associated with unacceptable cardiovascular risk.70 11 This is particularly true of findings from 
12 both gain- and loss-of-function variants in the LPL gene and risk of type 2 diabetes, which are 
13 directionally consistent with those previously reported for the same mutations and risk of heart 
disease.38 14 Notably, the directional concordance for risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes is 
15 in contrast to genetic evidence for other lipid-lowering agents (e.g. cholesterol-lowering 
variants near the molecular target of statins).71 16 In the context of a growing body of evidence 
linking lipolysis and heart disease risk,38,72-75 17 these data suggest that enhancing lipoprotein 
18 lipase activity may also become a viable preventive or therapeutic strategy in type 2 diabetes. 
19 In interpreting the results of this study, it is important to note that combining multiple 
20 genetic-association analyses to gain insights about a latent unmeasured phenotype (i.e. insulin 
21 resistance) is not immediately comparable with a univariate genome-wide association study of 
22 a trait (e.g. fasting insulin). However, we validated these genetic variants as being strongly 
23 associated with “gold-standard” measures of insulin sensitivity, with multiple insulin￾24 resistance related diseases, including a severe form of insulin-resistant partial lipodystrophy, 
25 and showed overlap with monogenic insulin resistance genes. Thus, approaches to leverage 

16
1 additional sources of evidence to prioritise genomic variation (such as multiple phenotypes or 
putative functional class76 2 ) represent a powerful use of extant genetic association results to 
3 advance understanding of biology previously intractable to conventional strategies. 
 Our results were based on genome-wide analyses of fasting insulin adjusted for BMI,28,29 4
5 and we did not identify loci with a primary effect on higher adiposity and secondary association 
6 with insulin resistance (e.g. FTO). Our approach was more likely to identify loci influencing 
7 insulin resistance at a given level of adiposity. Prompted by the strong association pattern of 
8 the genetic scores and variants, we focused on evaluation of mechanisms linking lower levels 
9 of peripheral adiposity with insulin resistance. The importance of adipose function as a 
10 prominent driver of common insulin resistance is highlighted by the observation that half of all 
11 variants associated with fasting insulin at genome-wide significance (without adjustment for 
BMI) in a previous study28 12 were included in our genetic score. However, our results do not 
13 preclude the presence nor diminish the importance of other mechanisms underlying insulin 
resistance.5,77 14 Indeed, the associations we observe of the genetic score with central fat, visceral 
15 fat and liver enzymes would be further strengthened after adjustment for overall adiposity. 
16 While we conclude that our findings implicate a primary effect on impaired adipose function 
17 and a secondary effect on insulin resistance, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of the 
18 reverse, nor that there are pleiotropic contributions to the associations.

1 Conclusions 
2
3 Collectively, our findings support the notion that limited capacity of peripheral adipose 
4 tissue to store surplus energy is implicated in human insulin resistance and related 
5 cardiometabolic disease in the general population. Furthermore, we highlight putative effector 
6 genes, tissues and mechanisms underpinning this link.

5 of genetic association studies. Body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist and hip circumference 
6 data are from the GIANT consortium and the UK Biobank study. Body fat percentage data are from the UK 
7 Biobank, EPIC-Norfolk and Fenland studies. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2 hour glucose and HbA1c data are 
8 from the MAGIC consortium. Squares with error bars represent the per-allele beta coefficients in standard 
9 deviation units and their 95% confidence intervals. Panel B: association of genetic scores with compartmental 
10 body masses. Data are from 12,848 participants of the Fenland and EPIC-Norfolk studies who underwent a DEXA 
11 scan. Squares with error bars represent the per-allele beta coefficients in standard deviation units and their 95% 
12 confidence intervals. Panel C: association with lower levels of leg fat mass and higher hazard of incident type 2 
13 diabetes by quintiles of the 53-SNP genetic risk scores. Associations are reported for individuals in the exposed 
14 category compared with the bottom quintile (reference category). Associations with leg fat mass are from 9,747 
15 participants of the Fenland study and are reported on the left. Associations with incident type 2 diabetes are from 
16 7,420 incident cases and 9,267 controls of the InterAct study and are reported on the right. Squares represent the 
17 beta coefficients in grams of leg fat mass (left plot) or the hazard ratio (HR) for incident type 2 diabetes (right

1 Online Methods 
2 Study design 
3 We integrated the results of genome-wide analyses on insulin and lipid phenotypes with 
4 the aim of identifying genetic variants associated with an insulin resistance phenotypic pattern 
5 (Supplementary Figures 1-4). We then investigated the mechanistic links of genetic variation 
6 at 53 identified genomic regions with cardiometabolic diseases by integrating analyses of: (a) 
7 cardiometabolic traits and outcomes from up to 451,193 individuals; (b) detailed continuous 
8 metabolic traits from 12,848 deeply-phenotyped individuals; (c) genetic and clinical features 
9 from 37 individuals diagnosed with familial partial lipodystrophy type 1; (d) gene expression 
10 from over 100 separate eQTL datasets and (e) siRNA mediated knockdown of putative effector 
11 genes in experimental adipogenesis models (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary 
12 Figures 1-2).

14 Participating studies 
15 Lists of phenotypes, participating studies and sample sizes for each analysis are in 
16 Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figures 1-2. Details about participants and 
17 cohorts with individual-level genotype data are in Supplementary Table 14. Ethical approvals 
18 were obtained at each study site and informed consent was obtained from all participants. 
19 The Fenland study is a population-based cohort study of 12,435 participants without 
20 diabetes born between 1950 and 1975. Participants were recruited from general practice 
21 surgeries in Cambridge, Ely and Wisbech (United Kingdom) and underwent detailed metabolic 
22 phenotyping and genome-wide genotyping. 
23 EPIC-Norfolk is a prospective cohort study of 25,639 individuals aged between 40 and 79 
and living in the Norfolk county in the United Kingdom78 24 at recruitment. EPIC-Norfolk is a 
constituent cohort of the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC).79 25 A total of 

29
1 3,101 participants with available dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were included in 
2 analyses of detailed anthropometry, while 9,150 participants were included in analyses of 
3 change in hip or waist circumference in individuals who gained weight during follow-up. 
4 EPIC-InterAct is a case-cohort study nested within the EPIC study, a cohort study of 
519,978 European participants.80 5 During an average of 8 years of follow-up, 12,403 individuals 
who were free of diabetes at baseline were identified incident type 2 diabetes cases.80 6 InterAct 
7 has also defined a randomly-selected subcohort of 16,154 individuals free of diabetes at 
baseline.80 8 Data on 15,357 individuals with available genotyping and not overlapping with 
DIAGRAM34 9 were included. 
10 UK Biobank is a population-based cohort study of ~500,000 people aged between 40-69 
years who were recruited in 2006-2010 from several centres across the United Kingdom.81 11
12 Associations with prevalent type 2 diabetes were estimated in 111,016 individuals (4,586 cases 
13 and 106,430 controls) of the initial UK Biobank dataset. We also used the UK Biobank data 
14 for anthropometry analyses and for a sensitivity analysis of prevalent coronary heart disease 
15 (i.e. self-reported myocardial infarction or angina) in 5,369 cases and 106,969 controls. 
16 The United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS; also known as 
17 Understanding Society) is a longitudinal panel survey of 40,000 households representative of 
18 the population of the United Kingdom. Participants were surveyed annually since 2009 and 
19 contributed information relating to their socioeconomic circumstances, attitudes, and 
20 behaviours via a computer assisted interview. For a subset of individuals who took part in a 
21 nurse health assessment, blood samples were taken and genomic DNA analysed. 
22 In addition to individual-level genotyping data, we used genome-wide meta-analyses 
23 results on a variety of cardiometabolic traits and disease endpoints (Supplementary Table 1 
24 and Supplementary Figures 1-2).

1 Detailed anthropometric analyses 
2 In the Fenland and EPIC-Norfolk studies, body composition was determined by dual￾3 energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using a Lunar Prodigy advanced fan beam scanner (GE 
4 Healthcare, Bedford, UK) using the encore software version 14.10.022 (GE Healthcare, 
5 Bedford UK). Participants were scanned by trained operators using standard imaging and 
6 positioning protocols. The coefficient of variation for scanning precision, calculated from 30 
7 consecutive scans, was 2% for total fat mass. The enCORE software was used to demarcate 
8 regional boundaries. All the images were manually processed by one trained researcher, who 
9 corrected demarcations according to a standardized procedure. Boundaries of body regions are 
10 described in details in the Supplementary Note. In the UK Biobank study, body fat percentage 
11 was estimated by bio-impedance using the Tanita BC418MA body composition analyser.

13 Association of genetic variants with insulin resistance phenotypes 
14 A dyslipidaemic pattern with higher triglyceride levels and lower HDL cholesterol is 
considered characteristic of the clinical presentation of insulin resistance 13 15 and has been used 
to specifically identify individuals with insulin resistance.30 16 In a previous large-scale genome￾17 wide discovery of genetic determinants of fasting insulin levels, among 19 fasting insulin￾18 associated loci we identified ten that were strongly associated with higher triglycerides and 
lower HDL cholesterol.28 19 This pattern of association was used to refine loci which were then 
validated as being associated with “gold-standard” measures of insulin resistance.31 20 Loci 
associated with insulinaemia but not with lipid traits included TCF7L2,
28 21 which is primarily 
implicated in insulin secretion, rather than resistance.82 22 These findings suggested that the 
23 combined association with this triad of phenotypes could help identify specific genetic 
24 determinants of insulin resistance. 

31
1 With this background, we systematically triangulated the results of the association of 
2 ~2.4M single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with fasting insulin adjusted for body mass 
index (FIadjBMI; from up to 108,557 participants of the MAGIC consortium),28,29 3 HDL￾4 cholesterol, and triglycerides (from up to 188,577 participants of the Global Lipids Genetics 
Consortium)32 5 using publicly available genome-wide results (Supplementary Figures 1-4). 
For FIadjBMI analyses, we used metabochip association results28 6 when available. We aligned 
7 alleles across the three phenotypes such that the effect allele was the insulin-raising allele. We 
8 took forward for further analysis all SNPs associated with higher FIadjBMI, higher 
9 triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol at p<0.005 for each of the three traits. The prior 
10 probability for association of a given SNP with the three traits and in the pre-specified 
11 directional concordance under the null hypothesis corresponds to 0.005*0.0025*0.0025 = 3.1 
x 10-08 12 . In each 1 Mb locus, we retained the lead SNP for association with fasting insulin for 
13 further analysis (Supplementary Figure 4). 
14 Fasting insulin analyses adjusted for BMI were chosen because we were interested in 
15 identifying genetic determinants of insulin resistance for a given level of adiposity. It has been 
16 proposed that adjusting genetic association analyses for covariates such as BMI might result in 
a bias known as “collider bias”.83,84 17 Therefore, we assessed the association of the 53 lead SNPs 
18 for a bias in the identification of variants primarily associated with BMI and artificially 
19 associated with fasting insulin, but found no evidence on such bias (Supplementary Figure 
20 12). 
21
22 Statistical methods 
23 We studied the association of individual SNPs and of genetic scores with continuous 
24 metabolic traits and endpoints. Where individual level genotype data was available, the 
25 associations of genetic variants or scores (i.e. the sum of effect alleles) with outcomes were 

32
1 estimated using multivariable linear, logistic or Cox regression models. For result-level 
2 association data, we used the inverse-variance weighted method developed by Burgess et al., 
3 assigning a weight of 1 to each SNP, to approximate the association of an unweighted genetic 
risk score.85 4 Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA v14.1 (StataCorp, College 
5 Station, Texas 77845 USA), R v3.2.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and 
METAL.29 6 All p-values presented in the study are two-tailed p-values.

8 Analyses in a severe form of partial lipodystrophy and insulin resistance 
9 We studied the clinical and genetic characteristics of 37 women with familial partial 
10 lipodystrophy type 1 (FPLD1; also called Köbberling-type familial partial lipodystrophy). 
11 All cases were referred to the insulin resistance/lipodystrophy specialist centre led by Drs 
12 Semple, Savage and O’Rahilly in Cambridge. FPLD1 is currently a clinical diagnosis used to 
13 describe predominantly women with selective paucity of limb adipose tissue, central obesity, 
severe insulin resistance, and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.86,87 14 As some women with 
15 lipodystrophy due to loss-of-function mutations in PPARG manifest a similar phenotype (i.e. 
16 FPLD3), mutations in this gene were excluded in all FPLD1 cases included in this study. The 
17 biochemical and anthropometric phenotype of the 37 FPLD1 patients was compared with that 
18 of female participants of the Fenland study. In these analyses we compared the phenotypes of 
19 the 37 FPLD1 patients with those of all Fenland study women (Figure 2) and with those of 
20 obese Fenland study women (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 8), who have a similar BMI 
21 to that of FPLD1 women. 
22 To understand the genetic basis of FPLD1, we carried out exome sequencing analyses in 
23 18 individuals from 9 pedigrees with FPLD1 without identifying any clear candidate mutations 
24 or genes. Sequencing, variant calling and annotation were performed as described previously 
(Family 2;88 Families 1 and 3–9 as part of the UK10K project).89 25 Calls were annotated with 

33
1 1000 Genomes allele frequencies and the NCBI dbSNP database build 132 
2 (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/). Variants were defined as potentially 
3 functional if they were non-synonymous, resulted in loss or gain of a stop codon or a frameshift, 
4 or occurred within essential splice sites. Those unlikely to have a functional impact were 
5 removed, as were all variants found with a MAF >1% in individuals of European descent from 
6 the 1000 Genomes Phase 1v3 (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521/) or 
7 the NHLBI ESP Exomes (URL: http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; January 2012). Further 
8 filtering was then implemented to retain only variants in genes seen in multiple patients. 
9 We compared the burden of the 53-SNP genetic score in the 37 FPLD1 patients with 
10 that of 5,296 unrelated control women from UKHLS. Genome-wide genotyping of UKHLS 
11 women was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanCoreExome-12 v1.0 BeadChip. 
12 Genotype calling was performed using the Illumina GenCall software. Genome-wide 
13 genotyping of FPLD1 patients was performed using the Illumina® Infinium CoreExome￾14 24v1.0 chip. Prior to imputation, the following quality control criteria were applied for 
exclusion of SNPs in PLINK90 15 (version 1.07): (1) minor allele frequency <0.01; (2) Hardy￾Weinberg equilibrium p<1 x 10-06 16 ; (3) call rate <99%; (4) differential missingness between 
cases and controls p<1 x 10-06 17 ; (5) SNPs showing differential genotyping between the 
18 CoreExome-24v1.0 and CoreExome-12v1.0 chips. Samples were excluded prior to imputation 
19 in PLINK based on the following criteria: (1) call rate <95%; (2) autosomal heterozygosity >3 
20 standard deviations from the mean; (3) pairwise identity by descent was calculated and one 
21 individual was removed for every pair of individuals with a pi-hat >0.05, with preference given 
22 to retaining female samples; (4) identity assessed by the concordance between the genome￾23 wide and Fluidigm® genotypes at 24 sites (excluding individuals with concordance <90%); (5) 
24 ethnic outliers based on a principal components analysis. Imputation was performed using the 
1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference panel using SHAPEIT291 (version 2.r644) and IMPUTE292 25

34
1 (version 2.3.1). FPLD1 cases and UKHLS controls were imputed together. In an analysis of 
2 the genetic principal components derived from genome-wide genotyping (defined based on the 
3 combined sample), the 37 FPLD1 patients clustered with UKHLS control women 
4 (Supplementary Figure 13). Association analyses were performed in R by logistic regression 
5 adjusting for age and the first 10 genetic principal components. We also derived a permutation￾6 based null comparator by performing 100,000 permutations of randomly selecting 53 SNPs 
7 (>1Mb apart) from genome-wide analyses of FPLD1 status adjusted for age and principal 
components and performing summary statistic Mendelian randomisation.85 8 Of 100,000 
iterations, 201 had a p-value less than our observed association (ppermutation= 2.01 x 10-03 9 ). 
10
11 Prioritisation of putative effector genes 
12
13 We sought to determine the putative effector genes at the 53 loci. We combined 
14 information on (a) physical proximity, (b) eQTL data from over 100 repositories, (c) functional 
15 and regulatory annotations and (d) previous knowledge about causal genes for monogenic 
16 forms of insulin resistance. 
17 For physical proximity analysis, we reviewed genes within a 1 Mb-window of each lead 
SNP and generated regional association plots using LocusZoom.93 18 For eQTL analysis, we 
19 analysed both publicly available and unpublished datasets (see below). For functional 
20 annotation, we used the gene and the tissue/cell type prioritisation functions of the integrative 
software DEPICT,44 21 in order to gain insights about putative effector genes, tissues and cell 
22 types. We also looked for nonsynonymous variants in linkage disequilibrium with the lead SNP 
(r2
>0.8) in European ancestry populations using Haploreg v3.94 23 
24 We assessed the overlap of identified loci with chromatin state definitions of active 
25 enhancers and active promoters for 98 cell types from the NIH Epigenome Roadmap project, 
26 including a total of 196 genomic annotations. For each of the 53 lead SNPs, we identified the 

35
set of proxy variants in high linkage disequilibrium (CEU r2
>0.8) using SNAP95 1 and defined a 
2 ‘locus’ as a lead SNP plus its proxies. We then calculated the number of loci where at least one 
3 variant at the locus overlapped a given annotation. We determined enrichment in the overlap 
4 at the 53 loci compared to an expected distribution built from randomly selected matched loci. 
First, we identified all variants with genome-wide significant association (p<5 x 10-08 5 ) to any 
trait in Europeans from the GWAS catalog.96 6 We then pruned this set of variants (using a CEU 
r
2 7 threshold of 0.1), resulting in a list of independent trait-associated variants. For each of these 
8 variants, we constructed a background ‘locus’ as the set of proxy variants in high linkage 
disequilibrium (CEU r2 9 <0.8). For each of the 53 loci, we then selected a locus from the 
10 background set matched on total number of proxy variants, total genomic distance covered, 
11 and distance of the midpoint to the closest gene transcription start site. We then re-calculated 
12 the overlap of each annotation in the set of matched background loci. We obtained the expected 
13 overlap for each annotation by averaging over 1 million permuted background locus sets. We 
14 then tested for enrichment of each annotation with a binomial test using the observed number 
15 of overlapping loci, total number of loci and expected percentage of overlapping loci. 
16 We compiled a list of 13 genes (PPARG, INSR, PIK3R1, TBC1D4, LMNA, PLIN1, AKT2, 
17 CIDEC, AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, PTRF, PCYT1A) known to cause monogenic forms of 
insulin resistance from the literature13 18 and used that to look for overlap with genes in identified 
19 regions. Two experts in the clinical care of patients with monogenic insulin resistance (Drs 
20 Semple and Savage) reviewed the curated list. 
21
22 Analysis of eQTLs in multiple tissues 
23 Using a curated collection of over 100 separate eQTL datasets, we queried whether the 53 
lead SNPs or their proxies (r2 24 >0.8) were associated with transcript expression in a wide range 
25 of tissues. Proxy SNPs in linkage disequilibrium in European ancestry populations were 

36
identified using SNAP.95 1 For this study, we considered all associations below a p-value cut-off 
of 1 x 10-06. A general overview of a subgroup of >50 eQTL datasets has been published,97 2
3 with specific citations for the >100 datasets included in the current query provided in the 
4 Supplementary Note. 
5
6 Specific analysis of eQTLs in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
7 We analysed in depth the association of lead SNPs with gene expression in subcutaneous 
8 adipose tissue using two subcutaneous adipose tissue cis-eQTL datasets. The first dataset was 
9 generated by the EUROBATS consortium and consists of samples from well-phenotyped 
healthy female twins (n=766) with eQTLs derived as described previously.98 10 We also used the 
subcutaneous adipose tissue data (n=298) generated by the GTEx consortium (version 6),99 11
12 which were obtained from www.gtexportal.org on 20/11/15. GTEx results were limited to 
13 GENCODE “protein_coding” and “lincRNA” biotype transcripts, and only variants with a 
14 minor allele frequency >0.01 were used. Linkage disequilibrium statistics between the index 
15 SNP (lead SNP for fasting insulin at the locus) and the most significant expression SNP for the 
16 gene were calculated in PLINK 1.9 using 1000 Genomes phase 1 version 3 European ancestry 
samples.90 17 We also assessed the regulatory trait concordance (RTC) value for SNPs associated 
18 with gene expression in adipose tissue, in order to assess the likelihood of co-localisation of 
signal with the lead eQTL signal at that region.100 19 In brief, if the index variant and the eQTL 
20 do tag the same causal variant, it is expected that removing the genetic effect of the index 
21 variant will have a significant consequence on the eQTL association. To this end, the RTC 
22 method assesses the likelihood of a shared functional effect between a GWAS variant and an 
23 eQTL by quantifying the change in the statistical significance of the eQTL after correcting for 
24 the genetic effect of the index variant and comparing its correction impact to that of all other 
25 SNPs in the interval. We considered an RTC of ≥ 0.8 or high linkage disequilibrium between 

37
the lead eQTL SNP and trait-associated SNP (r2 1 >0.8) to be supporting evidence of co￾2 localisation.

4 Functional studies in mouse OP9-K cells
5 We sought to experimentally validate candidate causal genes at loci associated with lower 
6 levels of peripheral adiposity, higher risk of type 2 diabetes and with gene expression in 
7 subcutaneous adipose tissue (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Figure 11). We 
8 studied the effects of gene knockdown using siRNA on adipogenic differentiation in murine 
9 OP9-K cell lines. The mouse OP9-K cell line used in this study is a model suitable for mid￾10 throughput screening of genes influencing adipogenesis. OP9-K cells are clonal cells derived 
11 from mouse stromal OP9 cells obtained from the bone marrow, that accumulate large lipid￾droplets after 72 hours of adipogenic stimulation.45 12 OP9-K cells were grown and differentiated 
using oleic acid-containing differentiation media as described previously.45 13 For siRNA 
transfections, 2.5 x 104 14 cells per well were cultured in the 24-well dish. After 24hrs, cells were 
15 transfected with smartpool siRNA (from Dharmacon) against each gene using Optifect reagent 
16 as per the manufacturer protocol. On the following day, differentiation of OP9-K cells into 
17 adipocytes was initiated by replacing the media with 500 µL of differentiation media. After 
18 48hrs of differentiation induction, differentiated cells were stained with adipored to assess lipid 
19 accumulation using fluorescent spectroscopy. For quantitative-PCR, total RNA was isolated 
20 from differentiated OP9-K cells and cDNA was synthesized using TaqMan® Fast Cells-to￾21 CT™ Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real￾22 time PCR analysis was performed on a TaqMan ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detector System 
23 (Applied Biosystems). Expression results were analysed relative to GAPDH mRNA content in 
24 the same sample.

Associations at the 53 loci with changes in hip circumference in weight gainers 
The association with lower levels of peripheral fat mass but higher cardiometabolic risk 
of the 53-SNP genetic score suggested that individuals with a greater number of alleles are 
unable to expand their peripheral fat compartment. To corroborate this finding, we used 
weight gain as a surrogate measure for a positive energy balance and change in hip 
circumference in weight-gainers as a surrogate measure for the changes in peripheral fat 
compartments. We tested the associations of the 53-SNP genetic score in longitudinal data 
from 9,150 participants of the EPIC-Norfolk cohort study who gained weight during a 
median follow-up of 3.7 years. In these individuals, the 53-SNP genetic score was not 
associated with the amount of weight gained during follow-up (beta coefficient [standard 
error] in kg of weight change per SD of genetic score, -0.026 [0.029]; p=0.37). However, in 
analyses adjusted for age, sex, hip circumference at baseline and weight at baseline and the 
amount of weight gained during follow-up, the 53-SNP genetic score was negatively 
associated with change in hip circumference (beta coefficient [standard error] in cm of hip 
circumference change per SD of genetic score, -0.069 [0.031]; p=0.027). In the same 
participants, in analyses adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference at baseline and weight at 
baseline and the amount of weight gained during follow-up, the 53-SNP genetic score was 
not associated with the change in waist circumference during follow-up (beta coefficient 
[standard error] in cm of waist circumference change per SD of genetic score, 0.055 [0.042]; 
p=0.20). These results support the notion that individuals with greater burden of the 53 alleles 
have a relative incapacity of expanding their peripheral fat compartment when challenged by 
a positive energy balance.

Selection of putative effector genes for experimental validation
In light of (a) the enrichment for loci overlapping adipose tissue active enhancer 
elements and affecting adipocyte gene expression and (b) the association of risk alleles with 
lower peripheral adiposity, but higher cardiometabolic risk, we hypothesised that some of the 
risk alleles may act via impaired adipogenesis. We further hypothesised that the effects on 
adipogenesis could be caused by the altered expression of an effector gene in peripheral 
adipose tissue (Supplementary Figure 11A). Therefore, to test this hypothesis, we selected 
five genes at four loci associated with (a) expression of a putative effector gene in 
subcutaneous adipocytes (p<5 x 10-08), (b) lower levels of peripheral fat (p<5 x 10-05 for hip 
circumference) and (c) higher risk of metabolic disease (p<0.05 for type 2 diabetes; see 
Supplementary Tables 10 and 13 and Supplementary Figure 11 for details). For the IRS1
(RTC=0.86) and L3MBTL3 genes (r2
between lead and best expression SNPs=0.83) there was 
evidence supporting co-localisation of phenotypic and expression signals. For the CCDC92, 
DNAH10 and FAM13A genes, the lead expression SNPs (eSNPs) at the locus (rs825452 for 
CCDC92, rs78985577 for DNAH10 and rs13149209 for FAM13A) were not captured by the 
HapMap-imputed FIadjBMI association data,21, 22 meaning they could not be captured by our 
triangulation of fasting insulin and lipid data. However, the best HapMap proxy for each of 
those eSNPs was also associated with FIadjBMI in MAGIC,1,2 further supporting our 
prioritisation of those genes (see below). 
For CCDC92, the lead eSNP (rs825452, pexpression=8.3 x 10-31) was in very low linkage 
disequilibrium (r2
=0.001) with our lead SNP for association with FIadjBMI (rs7973683). 
However, rs7973683 was also strongly associated with CCDC92 expression in adipocytes 
(pexpression=2.1 x 10-29), indicative of two distinct signals of association with CCDC92
expression levels. Furthermore, while the lead eSNP was not available in FIadjBMI results, a 
strong proxy (rs825453; r2
=1) for the lead eSNP was also associated with FIadjBMI 

(p=0.0053). In the same locus, we found that our lead SNP for association with FIadjBMI 
levels (rs7973683) was also associated with expression of DNAH10 (pexpression=1.9 x 10-08
). 
This was in modest linkage disequilibrium (r2
=0.27) with the lead eSNP for DNAH10
expression (rs78985577, pexpression=4.8 x 10-12). While the lead eSNP was not available in 
FIadjBMI data, a strong proxy (rs1316952; r2
=0.83) was also associated with FIadjBMI 
levels (p=0.000086). At FAM13A, our lead SNP for association with FIadjBMI levels 
(rs3822072) was also associated with expression of FAM13A in subcutaneous adipocytes 
(pexpression=7.6 x 10-12). Our lead SNP was in low linkage disequilibrium (r2
=0.038) with the 
lead eSNP (rs13149209, pexpression=4.5 x 10-21), a modest proxy for which (rs2085600; 
r
2
=0.72) was also associated with FIadjBMI levels (p=3.5 x 10-06
). These results suggest that 
multiple independent eQTLs of those genes in adipose tissue are also associated with insulin 
levels and therefore further support our prioritisation of these genes. Genes at all the loci 
showing the pre-specified pattern of association were studied experimentally, with the 
exception of KLF14. We did not seek to experimentally validate the KLF14 gene, because it 
has been studied previously and previous studies suggest complex aetiologic mechanisms at 
this locus, including a potential parent-of-origin effect.3
In dedicated figures and tables, we 
report association criteria (Supplementary Figure 11B), selection flow-chart 
(Supplementary Figure 11C), association estimates at loci with an eQTL signal in 
subcutaneous adipocytes (Supplementary Table 10) and at the prioritised loci
(Supplementary Table 13). Loci that did not meet the criteria were not prioritised for 
experimental validation of putative effector genes (Supplementary Figure 11 and 
Supplementary Table 10). Finally, on the basis of our hypothesis, we expected that the 
siRNA knockdown of the candidate causal gene would have effects on adipogenesis in the 
direction predicted by the adipose tissue eQTL.

Whole and regional body composition analysis 
Before scanning, the DEXA system was calibrated according to the manufacturer’s 
guidelines using a spine phantom made of calcium hydroxyapatite, embedded in a lucite 
block. The enCORE software automatically demarcates the regional boundaries. A protocol 
was established to manually refine these demarcations and all the images were processed by 
one trained researcher, who corrected the demarcations according to a standardized 
procedure. The arm region was derived by positioning a line from the crease of the axilla and 
through the glenohumeral. The trunk region includes the neck, chest, abdominal and pelvic 
areas. The leg region includes all of the area below the lines that form the lower borders of 
the trunk. The android region was defined as the area between the ribs and the pelvis, and is 
enclosed by the trunk region. This region is outlined by iliac crest and with a superior height 
equivalent to 20% of the distance from the top of the iliac crest to the base of the skull. The 
gynoid region includes the hips and upper thighs, and overlaps both the leg and trunk regions. 
The upper demarcation is below the top of the iliac crest at a distance of 1.5 times the android 
height. The total height of the gynoid region is two times the height of the android region. 
Estimates of overall and regional body fat, lean and bone masses were derived using the 
DEXA software. The software also uses an inbuilt algorithm to determine visceral adipose 
tissue (in grams) within the android region. The subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (in 
grams) was calculated as android fat mass minus visceral abdominal adipose tissue.

Combined directional Manhattan plots of the association with insulin resistance related phenotypes. 
The figure represents Manhattan plots of the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with fasting insulin adjusted for body mass 
index (FIadjBMI; Panel A), triglycerides (Panel B) and HDL cholesterol (Panel C). We plotted only variants with FIadjBMI, triglycerides 
and HDL cholesterol (p<0.005 for each phenotype). All associations are represented for the FIadjBMI-raising allele. The 630 alleles 
associated with higher FIadjBMI, higher triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol are plotted in dark red. The graph also plots 21 variants 
that meet the p-value threshold for the three phenotypes but were not associated in the required direction (grey). For graphic display 
purposes, p-values below 10-20 were represented as 10-20.

Colour scale: red indicates positive associations for the insulin-raising allele at each locus, while blue indicates negative associations.
Asterisks indicate known loci for the traits, i.e. those for which our lead SNP is within 500 kb either side of a lead SNP from the largest 
GWAS of that trait. 

Supplementary Figure 7 
Associations of the genetic scores comprising the 53 or 43 SNPs with glycaemic and anthropometric traits in large-scale meta-analyses

Panel A shows the association of the genetic scores with anthropometric and glycaemic traits in meta-analyses of genetic association 
studies. Body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, waist and hip circumference data are from the GIANT consortium and the UK Biobank
study. Body fat percentage data are from the UK Biobank, EPIC-Norfolk and Fenland studies. Fasting plasma glucose, 2 hour glucose
and HbA1c data are from the MAGIC consortium. Leg fat mass data are from the EPIC-Norfolk and Fenland studies. Squares with error

bars represent the per-allele beta coefficients in standard deviation units and their 95% confidence intervals. Panel B shows the
association with the same traits in participants of the Fenland study not included in discovery efforts which contributed to the 
identification of the 53 loci. Since HbA1c has been measured only in a subset of Fenland, the HbA1c analysis includes also individuals 
from the InterAct study subcohort who did not take part in discovery efforts which contributed to the identification of the 53 loci. Squares
with error bars represent the per-allele beta coefficients in standard deviation units and their 95% confidence intervals. Red and blue
squares represent results of the 53-SNP and 43-SNP genetic scores, respectively. None of the results presented in the figure is
adjusted for body mass index. Abbreviations: N, number of participants; SD, standard deviation; BMI, body mass index; WHR, waist-to￾hip ratio; FPG, fasting plasma glucose.

Associations of the 53-SNP genetic score with detailed anthropometric variables from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. 
The figure represents the association of quintiles of the 53-SNP genetic score with the absolute values of compartmental and total fat
mass. Data are from 9,747 participants of the Fenland study. The Fenland population was divided into quintiles of the distribution of the 
genetic score and each quintile was compared with the bottom (reference category). Squares with error bars represent the beta
coefficients in grams for individuals in the exposure category compared with the reference category and their 95% confidence intervals.

Associations of the rs4976033-G allele near PIK3R1 with continuous metabolic traits and cardiometabolic disease endpoints. 
Panel A represents associations with continuous traits, while Panel B those with disease endpoints. Squares with error bars represent 
the beta coefficients (Panel A) or odds ratios (Panel B) and their 95% confidence intervals. Abbreviations: HDL, high density lipoprotein;
LDL, low density lipoprotein; BMI, body mass index; WHR, waist-to-hip ratio; FIadjBMI, fasting insulin adjusted for BMI; FPG, fasting 
plasma glucose; 2hr glucose, glucose at two hours during an oral glucose challenge; SD, standard deviation; OR, odds ratio.

Associations of functional variants in LPL with cardiometabolic traits and disease endpoints. 
Panel A represents the association of the gain-of-function p.Ser447* (rs328; left) and of the loss-of-function p.Asp36Asn (rs1801177;
right) in LPL with lipid levels, anthropometric traits, liver markers and glycemic traits. Panel B represents the association of the two 
variants with the risk of coronary heart disease (from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics and CARDIoGRAM Exome Consortia
Investigators; PubMed ID: 26934567)5 and that of type 2 diabetes. Squares with error bars represent the beta coefficients (Panel A) or
odds ratios (Panel B) and their 95% confidence intervals. Abbreviations: HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; 
BMI, body mass index; WHR, waist-to-hip ratio; VAT, visceral adipose tissue; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; GGT, gamma-glutamyl
transferase; FIadjBMI, fasting insulin adjusted for BMI; FPG, fasting plasma glucose; 2hr, glucose at two hours during an oral glucose 
challenge; SD, standard deviation; OR, odds ratio.

Mechanistic hypothesis for the implication of putative effector genes in the observed associations and selection of genes for
experimental validation in cellular models of adipogenesis. 
In Panel C, numbers refers to loci meeting certain selection criteria. *We did not take forward the KLF14 gene to experimental 
validation because previous studies about the role of the gene in metabolic disease suggest complex aetiologic mechanisms at this 
locus including a possible parent-of-origin effect.3

Supplementary Figure 12 
Associations with fasting insulin adjusted for body mass index (FIadjBMI), body mass index (BMI), or fastin insulin (FI) of the 53
polymorphisms identified in this study. 
Panel A shows the association of the 53 lead polymorphisms from our study with FIadjBMI as a function of the association with BMI. 
There was no clear bias in the association with FIadjBMI (linear regression between beta coefficients of 53 polymorphisms, p=0.26). 
Panel B depicts the association with FI (unadjusted for BMI) of the lead 53 polymorphisms as a function of the association with
FIadjBMI. The line of fit was aligned with the line of equality consistent with no bias. In Panel A, the dark red line and surrounding areas 
represent the lines of fit with 95% confidence areas. The dashed grey line in Panel B represents the line of equality. Data about fasting 
insulin associations is from the MAGIC consortium; data about BMI associations is from the GIANT consortium.
