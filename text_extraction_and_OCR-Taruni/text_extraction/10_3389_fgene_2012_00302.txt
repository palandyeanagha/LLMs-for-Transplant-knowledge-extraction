Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is associated with biallelic mutations
in ENPP1 in the majority of cases, whereas mutations in ABCC6 (ATP-binding cassette
subfamily C number 6) are known to cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). However,
ABCC6 mutations account for a significant subset of GACI cases, and ENPP1 mutations
can also be associated with PXE lesions. Based on the considerable overlap of GACI and
PXE, both entities appear to reflect two ends of a clinical spectrum of ectopic calcification
rather than two distinct disorders. ABCC6 and ENPP1 mutations might lead to alterations
of the same physiological pathways.

GACI AND ENPP1 MUTATIONS
Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI; OMIM208000)
is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is characterized by
severe calcification of the internal elastic lamina in large- and
medium-sized arteries associated with intimal proliferation lead￾ing to arterial stenoses and heart failure within the first months of
life. Although survival to adulthood has been reported, GACI is
often lethal in the first 6 months of life. In the past,few patients sur￾vived the neonatal period (Moran, 1975; Morton, 1978), whereas
more recently, patients treated with bisphosphonates have experi￾enced a more favorable outcome (Rutsch et al., 2008; Ramjan et al.,
2009). Some patients may also develop hypophosphatemic rickets
with hyperphosphaturia, a finding associated with improved sur￾vival beyond infancy in patients with GACI (Rutsch et al., 2008;
Levy-Litan et al., 2010; Lorenz-Depiereux et al., 2010). The dis￾ease has been found to be caused by inactivating mutations in
ENPP1 (MIM 173335; Rutsch et al., 2003). Mutations in ENPP1
have been identified as the underlying defect in about 75% of the
cases of GACI (Rutsch et al., 2008, 2011). ENPP1 encodes the ecto￾nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (NPP1), a cell
surface protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and
extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi; Rutsch et al., 2001;
Goding et al., 2003). PPi potently inhibits hydroxyapatite crystal
deposition and growth and regulates chondrogenesis, collagen I
expression and synthesis, and other cell differentiation processes
(Bollen et al., 2000; Goding et al., 2003).
PXE AND ABCC6 MUTATIONS
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE; OMIM 264800) is a heredi￾tary, autosomal recessive, multisystemic disease characterized by
ectopic mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers of soft
connective tissues such as the skin, the retina, and the arterial
blood vessels. The clinical manifestations of classic PXE center on
the skin, the eyes, and the cardiovascular system. The primary
cutaneous lesions are small, yellowish papules on the neck and
in large flexural areas, and these lesions progressively coalesce to
form larger plaques, and skin folding occasionally develops. The
eyes are frequently involved by calcification of Bruch’s membrane
leading to angioid streaks, and bleeding from the choroidal ves￾sels can result in loss of visual acuity and, occasionally, in central
blindness. The cardiovascular manifestations derive from min￾eralization of arterial blood vessels, and include gastrointestinal
bleeding, intermittent claudication, hypertension, and sometimes
early myocardial infarcts. Additionally, PXE can manifest with
gastrointestinal hemorrhage and abnormal tissue mineralization
in different organs, including the liver, kidneys, spleen, breast,
and testes (Li et al., 2009; Plomp et al., 2010). Although dermato￾logical signs are common, the main burden of PXE results from
the complications in the visual and cardiovascular systems (Hu
et al., 2003). Cutaneous and eye involvement usually occurs in
adolescence, but may appear earlier in childhood. Cardiovascu￾lar complications usually develop later, in mid-adulthood (Naouri
et al., 2009). The prevalence of PXE is estimated to 1/25,000 to
1/75,000 in the general population (Chassaing et al., 2005; Li et al.,
2009). Mutations in the ABCC6 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily
C number 6) gene are demonstrated in about 66–97% of patients
who are genotyped (Bergen et al., 2000; Le Saux et al., 2000, 2001;
Miksch et al., 2005; Chassaing et al., 2007; Vanakker et al., 2008).
The ABCC6-transported substrate or substrates, which modu￾late arterial calcification and other phenotypic changes of PXE,
are not known, and hepatic abnormalities that have effects on
calcification-regulating plasma proteins such as fetuin have been
suggested to at least partially mediate the pathogenesis of PXE
(Hendig et al., 2006).
Generalized arterial calcification of infancy and PXE have been
considered to be two distinct entities in the past and have been

Nitschke and Rutsch GACI and PXE: two faces of the same coin
primarily linked to mutations in ENPP1 and ABCC6, respectively.
But recent findings indicate that GACI and PXE might be more
closely related than previously thought.
THE FIRST CASE OF GACI AND PXE IN ONE FAMILY
Recently, we reported on a family with two brothers born to
unrelated parents. The elder developed uncomplicated PXE in
adolescence. Interestingly, the younger brother died after his
second myocardial infarction at 15 months of age. Autopsy
demonstrated calcifications of the endocardium, with extensive
calcifications of the coronary arteries and of medium-sized arter￾ies and the aorta, leading to the diagnosis of GACI. We performed
molecular genetic analyses in the family. Unfortunately, no DNA
of the deceased younger brother with GACI was available. The
elder brother had two heterozygous missense mutations of ABCC6.
Each mutation was inherited from one of his heterozygous asymp￾tomatic parents. However, no ENPP1 mutations were found in the
three living family members (Le Boulanger et al., 2010).
This case was the first one suggesting a correlation between PXE
and GACI. We hypothesized that GACI could be independent of
ENPP1, but related to ABCC6 mutations and that on the other
hand PXE could be related to ENPP1 mutations.
PATIENTS WITH GACI CARRY MUTATIONS IN ABCC6
Based on this case of GACI and PXE in one family with ABCC6
mutations, we sequenced the ABCC6 gene in 30 patients with
a typical GACI phenotype but without disease-causing ENPP1
mutations. In 14 of these patients, we detected pathogenic muta￾tions in ABCC6 (biallelic mutations in eight patients, monoallelic
mutations in six patients). This study showed that biallelic muta￾tions in the ABCC6 gene account for a substantial number of
typical GACI cases (Nitschke et al., 2012). The fact that even
monoallelic mutations in ABCC6 were associated with the severe
phenotype of GACI cannot fully be explained on the basis of
autosomal recessive inheritance. However, mutations of other
disease-associated genes have not been ruled out so far.
PATIENTS WITH GACI AND PXE CARRY MUTATIONS IN
ENPP1
Three of our GACI patients, who showed extensive calcifications of
the large- and medium-sized arteries, arterial stenoses, and periar￾ticular calcifications in infancy, carried biallelic ENPP1 mutations.
These patients developed clinical features of PXE in childhood
between 5 and 8 years of age. The patients showed angioid
streaks and typical pseudoxanthomatous skin lesions (Nitschke
et al., 2012). Most recently, one additional 2-year-old patient with
a relatively mild form of GACI developed PXE with pseudoxan￾thomatous lesions of the neck, inguinal folds, and lower abdomen.
The patient was also found to harbor a homozygous missense
mutation in ENPP1 (Li et al., 2012).
GENOCOPY AND PHENOCOPY IN GACI AND PXE
GACI and PXE have been considered to be two distinct enti￾ties in the past and have been primarily linked to ENPP1
and ABCC6, respectively. But based on the overlap of geno￾type and phenotype of GACI and PXE, both entities appear to
reflect two ends of a clinical spectrum of ectopic calcification
and other organ pathologies, rather than two distinct disorders
(Figure 1). It was shown, that biallelic mutations in ABCC6
account for a significant number of typical GACI cases, which
involve widespread arterial calcifications, arterial stenoses, peri￾articular calcifications, and hypophosphatemic rickets. ABCC6
mutations can be associated with a much more severe pheno￾type, including death in infancy from myocardial infarction,
than was previously known. We conclude that the phenotypic
spectrum of diseases associated with ABCC6 mutations is much
broader than was previously assumed. In fact, the infantile
phenotype of patients carrying ABCC6 mutations can be indistin￾guishable from the phenotype associated with ENPP1 mutations.
The fact that the same ABCC6 mutations can cause the severe
GACI phenotype associated with death in early infancy and the
FIGURE 1 | Overlap of clinical manifestations associated with
mutations in ENPP1 and ABCC6. NPP1 and ABCC6 serve as a minor
component in the function of a network of factors that exert balanced
effects to promote and suppress arterial calcification. The transmembrane
ectoenzyme NPP1 generates AMP and PPi from ATP. PPi is hydrolyzed by
the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) to generate Pi, which
is a component of hydroxyapatite crystal deposition and plays a role in the
regulation of osteoblast differentiation. PPi suppresses hydroxyapatite
deposition and inhibits ectopic chondrogenesis (and modulates artery
calcification by other effects). The role of ABCC6 has to be defined.
Mutations of either ABCC6 or ENPP1 can cause the severe phenotype of
GACI, which frequently leads to death within the first year of life. While
mutations in ENPP1 can also cause typical pseudoxanthomatous skin
lesions and angioid streaks of the retina in children with GACI, who
survived the critical period of infancy, the later onset of “classic PXE”
phenotype without GACI was only observed in patients with mutations in
ABCC6. *Hypophosphatemic rickets has been observed frequently in
patients with ENPP1 mutations, but was observed only in one proband
carrying a mutation in ABCC6 on one allele.

Nitschke and Rutsch GACI and PXE: two faces of the same coin
relatively mild phenotype of PXE warrants further explanation.
Because of the difficulty with charting a clear pattern of inheritance
to phenotype, it is likely that mutations in other disease-associated
genes may play a role here.
Up to date, four patients who presented with GACI and carried
biallelic ENPP1 mutations developed the clinical manifestation of
PXE in childhood. Symptoms included angioid streaks and histo￾logically proven calcifications of elastic skin fibers. Thus, given the
poor prognosis of severe GACI, affected patients might die of the
cardiovascular complications of the disease before they develop
typical signs of PXE. This might be the reason that no previous
case of GACI has been described in the PXE literature. Also, many
PXE characteristics, including angioid streaks of the retina and
peau d’orange skin lesions might frequently be overlooked in the
clinical examinations of GACI patients. Hence, the true number
of patients carrying ENPP1 mutations and showing PXE lesions
might be higher. In summary, these findings show that mutations
in the different genes ENPP1 andABCC6 can lead to similar patho￾physiological consequences and that GACI and PXE do not simply
represent two distinct disorders. They rather represent a spectrum
of different peculiarities of ectopic calcification. It can therefore
be hypothesized that the pathophysiology of ENPP1 and ABCC6
related disorders is based on common downstream mechanisms.
