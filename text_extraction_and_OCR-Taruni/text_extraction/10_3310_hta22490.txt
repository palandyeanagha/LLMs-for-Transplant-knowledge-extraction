Criteria for inclusion in the Health Technology Assessment journal
Reports are published in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA programme, and (2) they
are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the reviewers and editors.
Reviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed ‘systematic’ when the account of the search appraisal and synthesis methods
(to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication of the review by others.
HTA programme
The HTA programme, part of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), was set up in 1993. It produces high-quality research
information on the effectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care in the NHS.
‘Health technologies’ are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation
and long-term care.
The journal is indexed in NHS Evidence via its abstracts included in MEDLINE and its Technology Assessment Reports inform National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. HTA research is also an important source of evidence for National Screening Committee (NSC)
policy decisions.

Abstract

Background: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a group of heterogeneous cancers that develop in cells
in the diffuse neuroendocrine system.
Objectives: To estimate the clinical effectiveness of three interventions [everolimus (Afinitor®; Novartis
International AG, Basel, Switzerland), lutetium-177 DOTATATE (177Lu-DOTATATE) (Lutathera®; Imaging
Equipment Ltd, Radstock, UK) and sunitinib (Sutent®; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA)] for treating
unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression and establish the cost-effectiveness of
these interventions.
Data sources: The following databases were searched from inception to May 2016: MEDLINE, MEDLINE
In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, Epub Ahead of Print, EMBASE, Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science.
Review methods: We systematically reviewed the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness literature on
everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib for treating advanced, unresectable or metastatic progressive
NETs. The following NET locations were considered separately: pancreas, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and
lung, and GI tract (midgut only). We wrote a survival partition cohort-based economic evaluation in
Microsoft Excel® 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) from the UK NHS and Personal Social
Services perspective. This comprised three health states: (1) progression-free survival (PFS), (2) progressed
disease and (3) death.
Results: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), RADIANT-3 [RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine
Tumors, Third Trial; pancreatic NETs (pNETs): everolimus vs. best supportive care (BSC)], A6181111 (pNETs:
sunitinib vs. BSC) and RADIANT-4 (RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Fourth Trial; GI and lung
NETs: everolimus vs. BSC), met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness systematic review. The risk
of bias was low. Although the NETTER-1 (Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy) RCT, of 177Lu-DOTATATE plus
30 mg of octreotide (Sandostatin®, Novartis) compared with 60 mg of octreotide, was excluded from the
review, we nonetheless present the results of this trial, as it informs our estimate of the cost-effectiveness
of 177Lu-DOTATATE. The pNETs trials consistently found that the interventions improved PFS and overall

survival (OS) compared with BSC. Our indirect comparison found no significant difference in PFS between
everolimus and sunitinib. Estimates of OS gain were confounded because of high rates of treatment
switching. After adjustment, our indirect comparison suggested a lower, but non-significant, hazard of death
for sunitinib compared with everolimus. In GI and lung NETs, everolimus significantly improved PFS compared
with BSC and showed a non-significant trend towards improved OS compared with BSC. Adverse events
were more commonly reported following treatment with targeted interventions than after treatment with
BSC. In the base case for pNETs, assuming list prices, we estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs) for everolimus compared with BSC of £45,493 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and for sunitinib
compared with BSC of £20,717 per QALY. These ICERs increased substantially without the adjustment for
treatment switching. For GI and lung NETs, we estimated an ICER for everolimus compared with BSC of
£44,557 per QALY. For GI (midgut) NETs, the ICERs were £199,233 per QALY for everolimus compared
with BSC and £62,158 per QALY for a scenario analysis comparing 177Lu-DOTATATE with BSC. We judge
that no treatment meets the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’s (NICE) end-of-life criteria,
although we cannot rule out that sunitinib in the A6181111 trial does.
Limitations: A RCT with included comparators was not identified for 177Lu-DOTATATE. The indirect
treatment comparison that our economic analysis was based on was of a simple Bucher type, unadjusted
for any differences in the baseline characteristics across the two trials.
Conclusions: Given NICE’s current stated range of £20,000–30,000 per QALY for the cost-effectiveness
threshold, based on list prices, only sunitinib might be considered good value for money in England
and Wales.
Future work: Further analysis of individual patient data from RADIANT-3 would allow assessment of the
robustness of our findings. The data were not made available to us by the company sponsoring the trial.
Study registration: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42016041303.
Funding: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.

Plain English summary
Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) usually occur in the intestine, but they are also found in the pancreas,
the lung and the rest of the body. Here we consider patients with advanced NETs who have previously
been treated and who are not suitable for surgery. We review the evidence for the clinical effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of three drugs used for treating NETs.
We systematically reviewed the effectiveness literature and wrote a mathematical model to estimate the
cost-effectiveness of the following treatments for use in the NHS in England and Wales: sunitinib and
everolimus for pancreatic NETs (pNETs), everolimus for gastrointestinal and lung NETs and everolimus and
lutetium-177 DOTATATE (177Lu-DOTATATE) for midgut NETs.
We critically reviewed three relevant clinical trials. All suggested that the new treatments slow disease
progression and reduce the risk of death. However, they also increase the chance of side effects. It was
difficult to compare the effectiveness of sunitinib and everolimus for pNETs because, in both relevant trials,
many patients assigned the control treatment subsequently received sunitinib or everolimus after their
disease relapsed. After adjustments were made to correct for this, we found no evidence for a difference
in effectiveness between sunitinib and everolimus for treating pNETs.
Two pharmaceutical companies also wrote mathematical models to estimate the cost-effectiveness of their
drugs: Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd (Frimley, UK) for everolimus and Advanced Accelerator Applications
Ltd (Saint-Genis-Pouilly, France) for 177Lu-DOTATATE.
Given currently accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness, our analysis suggests that, based on publicly
available drug prices, only sunitinib for pNETs might be considered good value for money in England
and Wales.

Scientific summary
Background
Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are heterogeneous cancers that develop in the cells of the diffuse
neuroendocrine system. The aetiology is poorly understood; however, NETs typically develop slowly
and may remain undetected over a number of years.
The characteristics of a NET (e.g. location, grade and differentiation, stage of tumour and secretory profile)
will determine the methods of treatment and affect prognosis. Prognosis is generally better with an early
diagnosis; however, NETs are commonly diagnosed at a later stage when they have already metastasised.
Between 2013 and 2014, 8726 neoplasms were diagnosed in England. Diagnosing NETs can be difficult as
they are often small tumours (< 1 cm in size) and they can occur almost anywhere in the body and present
with a vast array of symptoms (typically non-specific symptoms such as pain, nausea or vomiting) or no
symptoms at all.
The aim of treatment should always be curative. However, in the majority of cases it is most likely to be
palliative. As metastatic disease is common, improving quality of life is often the primary aim of treatment.
Individuals with NETs can maintain a good quality of life for a long period of time.
There are many treatment options for NETs. Initial treatment starts with surgery and symptom management,
after which treatment may include liver transplant, interferon alpha (Roferon-A, Roche Products Ltd),
chemotherapy, ablation therapies, targeted radionuclide therapy [including lutetium-177 DOTATATE
(177Lu-DOTATATE) Lutathera®; Imaging Equipment Ltd, Radstock, UK)], transhepatic artery embolisation/
chemoembolisation, external-beam radiotherapy and emerging therapies [including everolimus (Afinitor®;
Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) and sunitinib (Sutent®; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA)].
Objectives
The objectives of this study were to, first, estimate the clinical effectiveness of three interventions
(everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib) for treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease
progression and, second, establish the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.
Changes in project scope
During the course of this project, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) consulted
on amendments to the original project scope. The revised scope was agreed on 18 August 2016 and
the intervention lanreotide (Somatuline Autogel®; Ipsen, Paris, France) and the comparator octreotide
(Sandostatin®; Novartis) were removed.
Methods
The assessment comprises a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies,
a review and critique of the company submissions and a de novo economic analysis.

Clinical effectiveness systematic review
A systematic review, following methodological guidance from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination,
was used to assess the clinical effectiveness evidence on everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib for
treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression.
Identification of studies
Literature searching of seven bibliographic databases (including MEDLINE and EMBASE), four trial registries
(including Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov) and two websites [the European Neuroendocrine
Tumor Society [see www.enets.org/ (accessed 19 May 2016)] and the UK and Ireland Neuroendocrine
Tumour Society [see www.ukinets.org/ (accessed 19 May 2016)], and additional supplementary search
methods, were used for the identification of clinical effectiveness studies.
Study selection
l Population: people with progressed unresectable or metastatic NETs in locations covered by existing
and anticipated marketing authorisations for the interventions.
l Interventions: everolimus [pancreatic, gastrointestinal (GI) or lung NETs], 177Lu-DOTATATE
(pancreatic or GI NETs) and sunitinib [pancreatic NETs (pNETs)].
l Comparator: another intervention or interferon alpha, chemotherapy regimens and/or best supportive
care (BSC).
l Outcomes: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), response rates (RRs), symptom control,
adverse events (AEs) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Titles and abstracts were independently double-screened by two reviewers for inclusion and disagreements
were resolved by discussion. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria at the title and abstract stage were
double-screened at the full-text stage.
Data analysis/synthesis
The methodological quality of each included study was assessed and data were extracted, tabulated and
narratively synthesised. When the data allowed, indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) were performed
using the Bucher method.
Cost-effectiveness systematic review
Cost-effectiveness studies were reviewed in accordance with the methods used in the systematic review of
clinical effectiveness, extended to include electronic searches of bibliographic databases of health economic
studies. In addition to economic evaluation studies, costing studies in UK settings were included. Only full texts
were included, but relevant UK studies reported in conference posters were considered as supplementary
information.
Results
Clinical effectiveness systematic review
Number and quality of effectiveness studies
Of 6209 titles/abstracts screened, three trials, RADIANT-3 (RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors,
Third Trial), A6181111 and RADIANT-4 (RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Fourth Trial), met
the inclusion criteria for the review.
A fourth trial, NETTER-1 (Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy), was identified under the original scope but
excluded under the revised scope as it no longer met the inclusion criteria. This randomised controlled trial
(RCT) compared 177Lu-DOTATATE with 60 mg of octreotide. The Assessment Group appreciate that this
trial might be of interest to the committee and, following a request from NICE, the results and comparative
analysis are presented within the report.
SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY

xxviii

The risk of bias in all three included studies was low.
Summary of benefits and risks
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
Evidence consistently suggested a treatment effect for pNETs in favour of both everolimus (RADIANT-3;
n = 410) and sunitinib (A6181111; n = 171) compared with placebo for the outcomes of interest.
Treatment switching from the placebo arm to the treatment arm occurred in 73% of participants in
RADIANT-3 and 69% in A6181111. The treatment switching significantly compromised the OS results.
Overall, AEs were more commonly reported following treatment with everolimus and sunitinib than
following treatment with placebo.
Indirect treatment comparison for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
The ITC for PFS from central radiology review suggests that there is no difference between the treatments
[hazard ratio (HR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.97], whereas the ITC for PFS from local
review suggests that everolimus is associated with a 17% decrease in disease progression or death
compared with sunitinib (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.42). However, the 95% CI is consistent with there
being no difference in PFS effectiveness between everolimus and sunitinib.
For OS, the ITC suggests that there is a 2.56 times greater hazard of dying in the everolimus treatment
group than in the sunitinib treatment group, which is statistically significant. However, these analyses
were not adjusted for treatment switching after disease progression and should not be relied on.
For RRs, the ITC suggests that there is an 82% increase in the odds of a partial response in individuals
treated with sunitinib compared with those treated with everolimus. However, sunitinib was associated
with a 52% increase in the odds of progressive disease compared with everolimus. Everolimus was
associated with a 2.3 times greater odds of disease stability than sunitinib. However, all of these ITCs were
associated with wide 95% CIs, suggesting that there is little evidence of a difference in RRs between
everolimus and sunitinib.
Gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
Evidence consistently suggested a treatment effect for GI and lung NETs in favour of the use of everolimus
(RADIANT-4; n = 302) compared with placebo for the outcomes of interest. A limitation was the
immaturity of the OS data and bias from treatment switching in the control arm.
Cost-effectiveness systematic review
Four studies were identified, all of which were carried out with patients with advanced pNETs. Two studies
were model-based cost–utility analyses of sunitinib plus BSC compared with BSC based on the A6181111
trial data. Another study was a model-based cost–utility analysis of everolimus compared with sunitinib,
which used effectiveness data from a matched adjusted indirect comparison of the RADIANT-3 and
A6181111 trials. The fourth study was a model-based cost–utility analysis of sunitinib plus BSC compared
with BSC. All of these studies used the same semi-Markov model structure of three health states (stable
disease, progressive disease and death) and used parameter values derived from partitioning of parametric
OS curves between those states using parametric PFS curves. All of these studies were sponsored by the
manufacturers of the respective treatments under evaluation.
The study of everolimus compared with sunitinib found that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
for everolimus compared with sunitinib was equivalent to £30,524 at 2010 US prices, whereas the studies
that compared sunitinib plus BSC with BSC found that sunitinib plus BSC had a discounted cost per
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained relative to BSC of £22,587. This result allowed for an adjustment
for crossover to active treatment in the placebo plus BSC arm of A6181111.

The studies had severe limitations primarily as they were based only on Phase III trials with no active
treatment comparators. The generalisability of these findings to the NHS remains in question, particularly
as a conference abstract was the only identified report of a study in a UK setting.
Peninsula Technology Assessment Group de novo economic model and evaluation
We undertook a de novo cost-effectiveness analysis of the following decision problems:
l pNETs:
¢ everolimus plus BSC
¢ sunitinib plus BSC
¢ BSC alone
l GI and lung NETs:
¢ everolimus plus BSC
¢ BSC alone
l GI (midgut) NETs:
¢ everolimus plus BSC
¢ 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide (included as an intervention in scenario analyses)
¢ BSC alone.
The choice of these tumour locations was determined by the available effectiveness data identified in the
published literature. We did not perform subgroup analyses specified in our protocol because of the lack
of data reported in suitable form from effectiveness sources. We did not have access to individual patient
data (apart from A6181111) but extracted them from Kaplan–Meier curves.
We assumed that patients started treatment aged 60 years and assumed a 40-year time horizon. Costs
and QALYs were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Analyses were undertaken using the same three-health￾state model structure used in the economic evaluation literature and we assumed partitioned survival
using summary data on PFS, OS and time on treatment outcomes in RADIANT-3 and A6181111 (pNETs),
RADIANT-4 [GI and lung NETs and GI (midgut) NETs] and NETTER-1 [scenario analysis of GI (midgut) NETs
including 177Lu-DOTATATE]. We used OS data that were adjusted by the rank-preserving failure time
model whenever available.
We extrapolated observed PFS and OS in the RCTs by estimating parametric distributions of recreated
individual patient time to event PFS and OS data from those trials. For the indirect comparison in pNETs,
we adjusted the PFS and OS for sunitinib by the relative difference in the restricted mean time to event for
the respective outcome between the placebo arm in RADIANT-3 and the placebo arm in A6181111.
We measured the costs of drug administration and acquisition, AEs, health-care resource use and
post-progression therapy. In the base-case analysis, list prices were used for initial targeted treatments
and discounted prices available to English hospitals were applied to symptomatic and subsequent (after
progression) treatment with octreotide. We also excluded subsequent treatment costs from the base-case
analysis of GI and lung and GI (midgut) NETs and explored their likely importance in sensitivity analyses.
In the base-case analysis of pNETs, sunitinib produced the most life-years per patient at 6.39, followed by
everolimus at 4.69 and BSC at 3.46. The expected discounted QALYs were 3.24, 2.51 and 1.91, respectively,
and the respective discounted costs were £43,192, £42,646 and £15,761 respectively. Sunitinib (extendedly)
dominated everolimus, that is, although both targeted treatments produced additional QALYs compared with
BSC, sunitinib did so at a lower cost per QALY gained than everolimus and with a greater total number of

QALYs produced. At list prices, the ICER for everolimus compared with BSC was £45,493 per QALY and the
ICER for sunitinib compared with BSC was £20,717 per QALY.
In the base-case analysis of GI and lung NETs, treatment with everolimus resulted in 6.21 life-years and
3.74 discounted QALYs per patient, whereas BSC yielded 4.82 life-years and 3.05 discounted QALYs per
patient. The total per-patient discounted costs to the NHS for these two treatment options were £47,334
and £16,526 respectively. At list prices, the ICER was £44,557 per QALY gained for everolimus compared
with BSC.
In the GI (midgut) population, in the base-case analysis, treatment with everolimus resulted in 7.50 life-years
and 4.37 discounted QALYs per patient, whereas treatment with BSC resulted in 7.05 life-years and 4.19
discounted QALYs per patient. The total costs of these two treatment options were £55,842 and £21,119
respectively. Therefore, at list prices, the ICER was £199,233 per QALY for everolimus compared with BSC.
This figure was highly uncertain because of the lack of midgut subgroup-specific OS data from RADIANT-4.
A range of scenario analyses were conducted. In pNETs, adjustment for the effect of crossover on OS had
a large effect on cost-effectiveness. When relative effectiveness estimates from intention-to-treat OS data
were used, treatment with everolimus resulted in higher costs and fewer QALYs than sunitinib and the
ICER relative to BSC was £136,455 per QALY (compared with £45,493 in the base case), whereas the
ICER for sunitinib compared with BSC was £37,217 per QALY (compared with £20,717 in the base case),
at current list prices.
In the GI (midgut), applying background mortality produced ICERs for everolimus that were > £40,000
per QALY (compared with £199,000 in the base case). Another scenario involved the indirect comparison
of everolimus and BSC with 177Lu-DOTATATE for GI (midgut) NETs. In analyses restricted to costs and
benefits accrued up to disease progression, 177Lu-DOTATATE (extendedly) dominated everolimus (which
had an ICER of £90,181 relative to BSC at list prices) and had an ICER of £30,115 relative to BSC.
End-of-life criteria
Based on the data from the three included trials (RADIANT-3, A6181111 and RADIANT-4), only sunitinib
plus BSC in the pNETs population of A6181111 may meet the end-of-life criteria.
Conclusions
There is a high degree of uncertainty around the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of everolimus,
177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib in the treatment of advanced, progressive pNETs and GI and lung NETs.
This uncertainty has its origins in the lack of data that naturally accompanies a rare condition. The evidence
suggests that targeted initial treatments do provide benefits for PFS but the effects on OS are uncertain
because of the immaturity of some of the OS data and because of substantial treatment switching by
patients on disease progression in some trials.
Another area of uncertainty is the relative effects of targeted treatments on HRQoL. Although some of the
trials underpinning this technology assessment review have measured this outcome, they tend to cover
only the phase while patients are on treatment and it is therefore not known how HRQoL evolves over
time or towards the end of life. Even while patients are on active targeted treatment, the available HRQoL
data are inadequate to differentiate between treatments.
Seeking to address uncertainties in the evidence, we requested data from sponsors of the main trials;
however, we obtained data that were outdated and that related to only one trial. Further valuable research
would use individual patient data from RADIANT-4 to explore (1) the effect of adjustment for crossover
from placebo to active treatment on OS and cost-effectiveness and (2) the robustness of the results of
indirect comparisons with the NETTER-1 trial using methods ranging from simple Bucher-type methods to

more elaborate matching methods, such as those reviewed and investigated in this assessment. Similar
analyses for pNETs using updated OS data are also warranted.
Nevertheless, in pancreatic NETs, at current list prices, the ICERs relative to BSC are likely to be about
£20,000 per QALY for sunitinib and about £45,000 per QALY for everolimus. Everolimus is expected to
have a similar ICER for GI and lung NETS, but is unlikely to be cost-effective for GI (midgut) NETs. The
effectiveness evidence on 177Lu-DOTATATE is still too immature to make conclusive statements about
cost-effectiveness, but our exploratory analyses suggest that it produces significantly better PFS outcomes
than everolimus or BSC and, purely based on these outcomes, its ICER compared with BSC is approximately
£35,000 per QALY.

Chapter 1 Background
Description of the health problem
‘Neuroendocrine tumours’ (NETs) is the overarching term for the group of heterogeneous cancers that
develop in cells in the diffuse neuroendocrine system. The diffuse neuroendocrine system is made up of
neuroendocrine cells found in the respiratory and digestive tracts. As these cancers share common clinical
features, they are considered under the same group of neoplasms.1 Most commonly, NETs are found in the
lungs, pancreas or gastrointestinal (GI) system. NETs also encompass carcinoids and may be referred to as
neuroendocrine carcinoids, which leads to substantial confusion over their name.2
Aetiology, pathology and prognosis
The aetiology of NETs is poorly understood.1 Predominantly, NETs are sporadic in nature (i.e. they arise from
de novo changes); however, there is a small genetic risk associated with familial endocrine cancer syndromes.
Neuroendocrine cells are present throughout the gut and are the largest group of hormone-producing
cells in the body.2 NETs develop slowly and may remain undetected over a number of years. Therefore, it is
common for NETs to be diagnosed when they have already metastasised (i.e. spread to other organs or
tissues in the body).
Characteristics of neuroendocrine tumours
The characteristics of a NET will determine the methods of treatment and the impact on prognosis.
Important characteristics include the tumour location, tumour grade and differentiation, tumour stage
and secretory profile of the tumour. There are, however, inconsistencies in the reproducibility of diagnoses
between pathologists and institutions, which has been suggested to be caused by the use of a variety
of different classification systems and a lack of adherence to them.2
Location
Most NETs have been generally classified as foregut (including those in the lungs), midgut or hindgut, as
it was thought that they were derived from embryonic neural crest cells. However, this theory is not now
accepted and classification should be based on the site of origin of the tumour, that is, pancreas, lung,
stomach, small bowel or large bowel (colon). The term ‘carcinoid’ is outdated but colloquially refers to
NETs of the small bowel that secrete 5-hydroxytryptamine; the term ‘carcinoid’ is also still in common usage
for NETs of the lung. ‘NET’ is the preferred term for all of these tumours. NET tumours may be grouped
together as gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs. Typically, the locations of these tumours are as follows:1
l foregut tumours: develop in the bronchi, stomach, gallbladder, duodenum and pancreas
l midgut tumours: develop in the jejunum, ileum, appendix and right colon
l hindgut tumours: develop in the left colon and rectum.
Prognosis can be dependent on where a tumour is located. An analysis of 13,715 carcinoid tumours over
a 5-decade period in the USA found that the best 5-year survival rates were found in patients with rectal
(88.3%), bronchopulmonary (73.5%) and appendicle (71.0%) NETs.3 The lowest 5-year survival rates were
found in patients with pancreatic NETs (pNETs) (37.5%).3
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours Neuroendocrine tumours from the pancreas may also be called
endocrine tumours of the pancreas and include insulinomas (which produce the hormone insulin),
gastrinomas (which produce the hormone gastrin), glucagonomas (which produce the hormone glucagon),
VIPomas (which produce the hormone vasoactive intestinal peptide) and somatostatinomas (which produce
the hormone somatostatin). However, the majority of pNETs are non-functioning and do not produce
measurable levels of hormones that give symptoms.

Other neuroendocrine tumours Other, rarer locations for NETs include the thyroid gland (medullary
thyroid tumours), skin (Merkel cell cancer), pituitary gland, parathyroid gland and adrenal gland.
This assessment report focuses on the tumours of the pancreas, GI tract and lung as these are locations for
which the interventions of interest are licensed.
Tumour grade/degree of differentiation
A NET can be defined as grade 1, 2 or 3. The grade relates to an estimation of how fast the cells are
dividing to form new cells and is based on the histological assessment and the mitotic count of the
tumour. The grade of a tumour is also related to its differentiation. Differentiation relates to how well/little
the tumour looks like the normal tissue/tissue of origin. Well-differentiated and low-grade cancer cells
look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than poorly differentiated cells.
High-grade tumours have cells that look very abnormal and are likely to grow and spread rapidly.
In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a new system for grading cancer tumours.4
This grading system is also endorsed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) grading
schemes.5,6 The grading scheme is as follows:
l NET grade 1 (low grade)
¢ well-differentiated tumour with a low number of cells actively dividing
¢ Ki-67 index of ≤ 2%
¢ mitotic count of < 2 per 10 high-power field (HPF)
l NET grade 2 (intermediate grade)
¢ well-differentiated tumour, but with a higher number of cells actively dividing
¢ Ki-67 index of 3–20%
¢ mitotic count of 2–20 per 10 HPF
l neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) grade 3 (high grade)
¢ poorly differentiated, malignant carcinoma (most aggressive form of NET)
¢ Ki-67 index of > 20%
¢ mitotic count of > 20 per 10 HPF.
Stage of tumour (see Appendix 20)
Determination of the size of a tumour and whether or not it has spread beyond its original site is known
as staging of the tumour. Tumour staging is performed according to a system of site-specific criteria.
There are two main systems for staging NETs: the Union for International Cancer Control’s (UICC’s) TNM
Classification of Malignant Tumours, Seventh Edition7 (see Appendix 19, Table 133) and the ENETS staging
system5,6 (see Appendix 20, Table 134). The Royal College of Pathologists8 recommended both the WHO
and the ENETS systems for assessing the grade/stage of a NET. In current practice, both systems are used
together with the UICC grading system above. The difference between the UICC grading system and the
ENETS grading systems is not great and would not affect outcomes relating to this report.
Secretory profile
A tumour that is releasing above-typical levels of hormones is known as a functioning tumour. The
increase in hormone release will often cause symptoms that may themselves need treating in addition to
treating the cancer. For example, hormones released by a pNET include insulin, glucagon and pancreatic
polypeptide, whereas hormones released by an appendix NET include serotonin and somatostatin.
Tumours that are not releasing hormones, and, therefore, that have no hormone-related clinical features,
are known as non-functioning tumours.

Epidemiology
Incidence and prevalence
In October 2016, Public Health England (PHE)9 published the first data briefing on the incidence and
survival in NETs and NECs in England. In 2013 and 2014, 8726 neoplasms were diagnosed, equating to
4000 per year or an approximate rate of 8 per 100,000 people per year (not age standardised). Although
the annual incidence of NETs is low, because of the long survival of individuals with NETs, the prevalence is
much greater and has been calculated as 35 per 100,000 people.10
Incidence trends for NETs were compared between a Norwegian registry and an American registry.11
From the time period 1993–7 to 2000–4, there was an incidence rate increase of 72% for NETs in Norway
(from 2.35 to 4.06 per 100,000 people). Over the same time period in America, the increase was 37%
(from 4.22 to 5.79 per 100,000 people) for the white population and 40% (from 5.48 to 7.67 per
100,000 people) for the black population. In a Canadian population, between 1994 and 2009, the
incidence rates for NETs at all locations increased by 138% (from 2.46 to 5.86 per 100,000 people).12
More specifically, for the subgroup of GI NETs, Ellis et al.13 reviewed incidence rates in the UK between
1971 and 2006. In this time period, 10,324 cases of GI NETs were identified from the national population￾based cancer registry. They report an overall increase per 100,000 people from 0.27 in men and 0.35 in
women (1971–8) to 1.32 in men and 1.33 in women (2000–6). This is equivalent to an increase in
incidence rates for GI NETs from 1971 to 2006 of 392% for men and 282% for women.13
However, these incidence rates for the diagnosis of NETs do not account for the overall prevalence of
NETs. As the delay in diagnosis is typically 5–7 years after the appearance of the first symptoms, many
cases of NETs are undiagnosed.1
Public Health England9 produced a diagram depicting the morphology (form of the neuroendocrine
neoplasms) and topography (location of the neuroendocrine neoplasms) of 8726 individuals diagnosed
with NETs and NECs in 2013 and 2014. Low-grade (grade 1) NETs and not-otherwise-specified NECs make
up the predominant morphology of neuroendocrine neoplasms in England. PHE went on to describe some
characteristics of the cohort:
l almost an exact 50 : 50 male-to-female ratio
l no obvious variation with geographical region
l no obvious variation by ethnicity
l distribution of age similar to that of other malignant cancers combined
l higher incidence of patients from the most affluent population quintile (20.2%) than from the most
deprived population quintile (18.6%; p = 0.011).
Risk factors
As NETs are sporadic in nature; there are very few factors known to determine susceptibility to developing
a NET.
In the USA, African American males have a higher overall incidence rate of NETs than other demographic
groups.3 Following an epidemiological review of NETs in Japan, the authors compared the distribution of
the origin of NETs between European and US populations and Asian populations.14 In the former countries,
a midgut origin represented 30–60% of new NETs, whereas in Asian populations the midgut was the
origin of < 10% of new NETs. In a parallel way, the hindgut was the origin of a higher proportion of new
NETs in Asian populations.14 A case–control study of risk factors for NETs of the small intestine, stomach,
lung, pancreas and rectum in 740 individuals with NETs and 924 healthy control subjects in the USA
indicated an increased risk for women with a family history of cancer and diabetes mellitus.15 In contrast,
in the UK, PHE9 found no association of ethnicity and sex with NET prevalence.

There are some suggestions that individuals suffering from rare family syndromes may have a higher risk
of developing NETs. These family syndromes include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1),
neurofibromatosis type 1 and von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome.
Survival
Although prognosis is generally better with an early diagnosis, the majority of NETs are diagnosed at a
later stage when the tumour has already metastasised.
In data collected between 1986 and 1999 for 4104 cases of malignant digestive endocrine tumours
in England and Wales, overall 5-year and 10-year survival was reported to be 45.9% and 38.4%
respectively.16 Well-differentiated tumours had a higher 5-year survival rate (56.8%), whereas small-cell
tumours had the lowest 5-year survival rate (5.2%). Survival rates were higher for women and young
people (15–54 years vs. 55–74 years and 75–99 years) and the overall prognosis was dependent on the
features (e.g. tumour differentiation, anatomical site, histological type) of the NET.16
Although it is impossible to compare accurately different countries with the data available, median 5-year
survival varied from 38% to 61% across Europe,17 Taiwan18 and Canada.12 Whether or not survival has
improved over time remains debated. Korse et al.19 reported in the Netherlands an ongoing improvement
in survival for well-differentiated NETs and suggested that the introduction of somatostatin analogues
(SSAs) and their long-acting forms may explain this change in survival over time. However, other research
groups in the USA and France have not confirmed this trend.20,21
Impact of the health problem
Significance for patients in terms of ill health (burden of disease)
Although prognosis is better with an early diagnosis, NETs are generally diagnosed at a late stage when
the tumour has already metastasised. In such cases, treatment is rarely curative, although individuals can
live and maintain a good quality of life for a number of years (e.g. 68–77% of people diagnosed with a
carcinoid tumour will survive for ≥ 5 years22). The primary management strategy for NETs is managing
symptoms originating from the tumour. The onset of symptoms, however, may take between 3 and
5 years from the development of the tumour. Symptoms can vary widely and some patients may have
no symptoms or non-specific and vague symptoms (often leading to a delay in diagnosis).
Most individuals with NETs will experience non-specific symptoms such as pain, nausea and vomiting and,
in some cases, anaemia, because of intestinal blood loss. Most GEP NETs are non-functioning and present
predominantly with mass effects of the primary tumour or metastases (usually liver).1 Symptoms are more
common with functioning pNETs, in which hormones are significantly elevated.
In total, 20% of well-differentiated endocrine tumours of the jejunum or ileum (midgut NETs) will have
carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome consists of (usually) dry flushing (without sweating; 70% of cases)
with or without palpitations, diarrhoea (50% of cases) and intermittent abdominal pain (40% of cases).1
The metastases in the liver release vasoactive compounds, including biogenic amines (e.g. serotonin and
tachykinins), into the systemic circulation, which cause the carcinoid syndrome. Direct retroperitoneal
involvement with venous drainage bypassing the liver may also cause carcinoid syndrome (i.e. it is not
dependent on liver metastases).1
Carcinoid crisis may also occur in individuals with NETs. Symptoms include profound flushing,
bronchospasm, tachycardia and widely and rapidly fluctuating blood pressure. It is usually linked to an
anaesthetic induction for an operation or other invasive therapeutic procedure and is thought to be linked
to the release of mediators leading to high levels of serotonin and other vasoactive peptides.1

Measurement of disease
A number of outcomes can be measured in clinical trials or as part of the management of disease:
l Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause.
l Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomisation until disease progression or death.
l Objective response rate (ORR), defined as either a partial response or a complete response:
¢ Complete response – all detectable tumour has disappeared.
¢ Partial response – roughly corresponds to a ≥ 50% decrease in the total tumour volume but with
evidence of some residual disease still remaining.
¢ Stable disease – includes either a small amount of growth (typically < 20% or < 25%) or a small
amount of shrinkage.
¢ Progressive disease – means that the tumour has grown significantly or that new tumours have
appeared. The appearance of new tumours is always defined as progressive disease regardless of
the response of other tumours. Progressive disease normally means that the treatment has failed.
l Health-related quality of life (HRQoL): how a person’s well-being is affected by treatment. HRQoL is a
key measure for the treatment of NETs as this captures changes in symptom control. It is the control of
the symptoms that has the most impact on a patient’s day-to-day life.
Current service provision
Management of disease
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of NETs can be difficult as they are often small tumours (some may be < 1 cm in size), they can
occur almost anywhere in the body and they can result in a vast array of symptoms or no symptoms at all.
NETs are slow-growing tumours and may be present for many years without recognisable symptoms.
Therefore, diagnosis often occurs at quite a late stage in the disease.
Typical symptoms in the early stages include vague abdominal pain and potential changes in bowel habits,
which primarily are diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.23 More progressive symptoms include shortness
of breath, loss of appetite and weight loss.24 Diagnosis primarily occurs following detailed histology. Other
tests may include urine tests, blood tests, ultrasound scans, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans, radioactive scans and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans.
Diagnosis is also dependent on the clinical manifestations, peptide and amine secretions and specialised
radiological and nuclear imaging of the NETs.1 Being able to determine the secretory products of a NET is
helpful for diagnosis, to assess the efficacy of subsequent treatment and to assess changes in prognosis.1
Similarly, imaging is used not only for detecting the primary tumour, but also for screening at-risk
populations, assessing the extent of the disease and assessing the response to treatment at follow-up.1
Treatment
The aim of treatment, when realistically possible, should always be curative. However, in the majority of
cases it is most likely to be palliative (i.e. aimed at symptom control). As metastatic disease is common for
individuals with NETs, often improving quality of life is the primary aim of treatment (as opposed to curing
the disease).1 Individuals with NETs can maintain a good quality of life for a long period of time.1 Quality of
life is therefore assessed regularly throughout treatment.
There is a vast array of treatment options for treating NETs. The initial treatment often starts with surgery
and symptom management. Surgery is the only curative treatment for NETs. Symptom treatment,
particularly with hormonal hypersecretion in functional NETs, can have a significant impact on an

individual’s quality of life as the symptoms themselves, as opposed to the cancer, may be life-threatening
(e.g. severe diarrhoea and hypokalaemia).1 Symptom control is often manged with a SSA, for example
octreotide (Sandostatin®; Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) or lanreotide (Somatuline Autogel®;
Ipsen, Paris, France). Available treatments that follow surgery and initial symptom control include:
l liver transplant
l interferon alpha (Roferon-A, Roche Products Ltd)
l chemotherapy
l ablation therapies
l targeted radionuclide therapy, including one of the interventions of interest in this assessment report:
lutetium-177 DOTATATE [(177Lu-DOTATATE) Lutathera®; Imaging Equipment Ltd, Radstock, UK]
l transhepatic artery embolisation/chemoembolisation
l external-beam radiotherapy
l emerging therapies, including two of the interventions of interest in this assessment report: everolimus
(Afinitor®; Novartis) and sunitinib (Sutent®; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA).
Describing an overarching treatment pathway for NETs is challenging as there are many different options
depending on the characteristics of the NET (e.g. location, grade, differentiation, secretory profile).
Current service cost
The economic burden to the NHS of health-care provision for people with NETs is not well documented.
This may be partly because of the rarity and heterogeneity of the disease, but also because significant new
therapeutic options have only recently been introduced.
Public Health England9 has reported that approximately 4000 new cases of neuroendocrine neoplasms are
diagnosed each year. From a budgetary perspective this is a small subgroup of the 300,000 new cancer
diagnoses registered annually in England,25 but with the arrival of new high-cost targeted therapeutic
treatments, the cost-effectiveness of disease management is now a relevant area for scrutiny through
secondary research.
The main costs involved in current service provision for people with inoperable progressive NETs can be
divided into the cost of diagnosis and monitoring of disease (e.g. measurement of blood markers and CT,
MRI and PET), the cost of acquiring and administering active and supportive treatments (in particular
long-acting repeat SSA therapy but also chemotherapy), the cost of managing symptoms (if the tumour
is functioning), the cost of managing adverse events (AEs) and the cost of human resources for patient
consultation, multidisciplinary team meetings and hospitalised care.
Relevant national guidelines, including National Service Frameworks
Guidelines for the management of GEP NETs (including carcinoid tumours) were published in 2012 by a
group of authors who are members of the UK and Ireland Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (UKINETS).1
There is a related guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) from 2010
that focuses on tumours of unknown origin26 that fall under the NETs umbrella. This guideline is distinct
from the work in this report, which focuses on pancreatic, lung and GI NETs.
Description of the technology under assessment
Summary of interventions
The scope of this review is to ascertain the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three
interventions for unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression. These interventions
are everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib.

Everolimus27
Everolimus is an orally active agent that is able to slow down the growth and spread of a tumour. It acts by
binding to FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP-12) to form a complex, which is able to block the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein. Division of tumour cells and growth of blood vessels require mTOR
and it is through the blocking of mTOR that everolimus is able to slow down the growth and spread of
the tumour.
Everolimus has a marketing authorisation for tumours of pancreatic origin:
Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well- or moderately-differentiated
neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin in adults with progressive disease.
European Medicines Agency.27 © EMA [1995–2018]
It also has a marketing authorisation for NETs of GI or lung origin:
Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated (Grade 1 or
Grade 2) non-functional neuroendocrine tumours.
European Medicines Agency.27 © EMA [1995–2018]
Everolimus is an oral drug that is typically given at a dose of 10 mg a day. It is recommended that
treatment is continued for as long as benefits are observed or an unacceptable level of side effects occur.
The dose of everolimus may be reduced or stopped in an effort to minimise side effects. Tablets should be
taken every day at the same time of day.
The most common side effects of everolimus (affecting > 1 in 10 people) are rash, pruritus (itching),
nausea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia (taste disturbances), headache, decreased weight, peripheral
oedema (swelling, especially of the ankles and feet), cough, anaemia (low red blood cell count), fatigue
(tiredness), diarrhoea, asthenia (weakness), infections, stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth),
hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose level), hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol level),
pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs) and epistaxis (nosebleeds). Everolimus is not suitable for people
who are hypersensitive to rapamycin derivatives.
Everolimus was removed from the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) on 12 March 2015; it was previously available
for the treatment of progressive unresectable or metastatic well-differentiated NETs of the pancreas.
177Lu-DOTATATE28
Lutetium-177 DOTATATE is a radiolabelled SSA. It is made up of a radionuclide (177Lu) and the
peptide–chelator complex [DOTA0, Tyr3-]-octreotate (DOTATATE). The (Tyr3)-octreotate binds to malignant
cells that overexpress somatostatin receptors [specifically the somatostain receptor type 2 (SSTR2)]. Once
bound, the 177Lu-DOTATATE accumulates within the tumour cells, delivering cytotoxic radiation that
kills them.
As of December 2016, 177Lu-DOTATATE does not have marketing authorisation in the UK for any indication.
Administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE is through an intravenous infusion and involves 3 days of hospital
appointments, including an overnight stay. Typically, four cycles are administered over a total of 8 to
10 months.
There are two main types of side effects from 177Lu-DOTATATE: those relating to the therapy and those
relating to the radiation dose given. Side effects related to the therapy include nausea, pain, flushing,
sweating, palpitations, wheezing, diarrhoea, hair loss and fatigue. Side effects relating to the radiation
dose include the effects on bone marrow production and kidney function, which in turn may increase the
number of infections experienced by patients.

Lutetium-177 DOTATATE was removed from the CDF on 4 November 2015. It was previously available
for the treatment of advanced NETs after sunitinib/chemotherapy, pNETs and midgut carcinoid tumours
(after octreotide/somatostatin therapies).
Sunitinib29
Sunitinib is a protein kinase inhibitor that is able to reduce the growth and spread of cancer and cut off
the blood supply that enables cancer cell growth. Sunitinib works by blocking enzymes known as protein
kinases that are found in some receptors at the surface of cancer cells. The development of new blood
vessels and the growth and spread of cancer cells requires protein kinases and it is through the blocking of
these enzymes that sunitinib is able to slow the growth and spread of the tumours.
Sunitinib has a marketing authorisation for tumours of pancreatic origin:
SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated pNETs with
disease progression in adults.
European Medicines Agency.27 © EMA [1995–2018]
Sunitinib is an oral drug and is typically given at a dose of 37.5 mg a day. Treatment is recommended to
be continued for as long as benefits are observed or an unacceptable level of side effects occurs. The dose
of sunitinib may be reduced or stopped in an effort to minimise side effects.
The most common side effects of sunitinib are fatigue (tiredness), GI disorders (such as diarrhoea, feeling
sick, inflammation of the lining of the mouth, indigestion and vomiting), respiratory disorders (such as
shortness of breath and cough), skin disorders (such as skin discoloration, dryness of the skin and rash),
hair colour changes, dysgeusia (taste disturbances), epistaxis (nosebleeds), loss of appetite, hypertension
(high blood pressure), palmar–plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (rash and numbness on the palms
and soles), hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland), insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep),
dizziness, headache, arthralgia (joint pain), neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood
cell), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), anaemia (low red blood cell count) and leukopenia
(low white blood cell count).
Sunitinib is available on the CDF for the treatment of pNETs when all of the following criteria are met:
l application made, and first cycle of systemic anticancer therapy to be prescribed, by a consultant
specialist specifically trained and accredited in the use of systemic anticancer therapy
l biopsy-proven well-differentiated pNET
l first-line indication or second-line indication or third-line indication
l no previous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.
Identification of important subgroups
From the NICE scope,30 the following subgroups were identified as being important in the treatment
of NETs:
l location of tumour
l grade/degree of differentiation
l stage of tumour
l secretory profile
l number of previous treatments.
Further information on these subgroups can be found in Characteristics of neuroendocrine tumours.

Current usage in the NHS
It was difficult to ascertain the current usage of everolimus, sunitinib and 177Lu-DOTATATE in the NHS.
In its submission, Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) Ltd31 (Saint-Genis-Pouilly, France) reported that,
although unlicensed, 177Lu-DOTATATE has been used to treat patients in England through the CDF
(confidential information has been removed). Likewise, Pfizer32 report that sunitinib is also available
through the CDF and is used in the NHS in England for the treatment of patients with pNET (52 requests
were made in the 12 months ending March 2015). Novartis33 did not report in its submission the estimated
use of everolimus within the NHS in England; however, our clinicians suggest that the rate of use of
everolimus is higher than that of sunitinib.
Anticipated costs associated with the interventions
The cost of treating a patient with everolimus or sunitinib varies from one patient to the next because the
duration of treatment with these oral preparations is continuous and largely dependent on effectiveness for
the individual. The mean duration of treatment with everolimus in the RADIANT-3 (RAD001 in Advanced
Neuroendocrine Tumors, Third Trial)34 and RADIANT-4 (RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Fourth
Trial)35 trials of NET patients is about 9 months, with a range of 1 week to 2 years.34 In practice, it is disease
stability and drug tolerability that trigger the decision to purchase the next month of therapy. Everolimus and
sunitinib are normally self-administered and so the cost of drug delivery is limited to the time needed by
hospital pharmacy staff to dispense the drugs. In contrast, the drug acquisition cost of 177Lu-DOTATATE is
less variable between patients because its delivery is fixed to a maximum of four treatment cycles. In addition,
in comparison to the oral preparations of everolimus and sunitinib, the delivery of 177Lu-DOTATATE is more
resource intensive. 177Lu-DOTATATE is a radiolabelled intravenous preparation and so administration
involves careful handling, specialist staff and post-administration observation, which for most patients means
an overnight hospital stay. Beyond acquisition and administration, the remaining treatment-related costs arise
from disease monitoring and the medical management of AEs, which will of course differ across treatments
but which are less substantial components of the overall cost.
We expect that all of these cost components will vary between individuals and hence they were subject to
modelling, but the acquisition costs of treatments are presented in Table 23 for simple comparative purposes.36

Chapter 3 Definition of the decision problem
Decision problem
Population
The population specified in the final scope issued by NICE30 is people with progressed unresectable or
metastatic NETs. In addition, the population must be in accordance with the specific locations covered
by the existing and anticipated marketing authorisations of the interventions.
Subgroups of interest based on the NICE scope include:
l location of the tumour
l grade/degree of differentiation of the tumour
l stage of the tumour
l secretory profile of the tumour
l number of previous treatments.
Interventions
l Everolimus – for NETs of GI, pancreatic or lung origin.
l Lutetium-177 DOTATATE – for NETs of GI or pancreatic origin.
l Sunitinib – for NETs of pancreatic origin.
Comparators
Interventions should be compared with each other and with:
l interferon alpha
l chemotherapy regimes (including but not restricted to combinations of streptozocin, fluorouracil (5-FU),
doxorubicin, temozolomide and capecitabine)
l best supportive care (BSC).
The Assessment Group (AG) noted, following consultation with our clinicians, that interferon alpha was
not commonly used within UK clinical practice.
Outcomes
The outcomes of interest based on the NICE scope include:
l OS
l PFS
l response rates (RRs: including complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease,
tumour shrinkage and ORR)
l symptom control
l AEs
l HRQoL.
Key issues
The primary factors that may influence the clinical effectiveness of treatment for individuals with NETs are
predominantly covered within the population subgroups listed in Population.

In addition to the number of previous treatments, covered as a population subgroup, the use of concomitant
treatment (primarily SSA use) while taking part in clinical trials may also be a key issue. This is because the
administration of SSAs as a concomitant treatment is not uniform in the treatment of NETs.
Treatment switching from placebo to the active treatment is also another key issue for consideration in
terms of how the switching may confound the outcomes reported for the placebo arm.
Overall aims and objectives of the assessment
The aim of this report was to review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of everolimus,
177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib for treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression in
a multiple technology appraisal (MTA). We carried out a systematic review of clinical effectiveness studies
to assess the medical benefit and risks associated with these treatments, and compared the treatments
against available alternative standard treatments. We also assessed whether or not these drugs are likely to
be considered good value for money for the NHS using a model-based economic evaluation.

Chapter 4 Assessment of clinical effectiveness
Methods for reviewing effectiveness
Evidence for the clinical effectiveness of everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib within their marketing
authorisations for treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression was obtained by
conducting a systematic review of published and unpublished research evidence. This review was undertaken
following the methodological guidance published by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD).38
Changes to the protocol
As discussed in Chapter 2, NICE issued a revised scope for this project on 18 August 2016.30 The revised
scope necessitated a change to our published protocol39 as lanreotide was removed as an intervention and
octreotide was removed as a comparator. A revised protocol was drafted (PROSPERO CRD42016041303);
there were no other changes to the published protocol.
Identification of studies
The literature search aimed to systematically identify studies relating to the clinical effectiveness of
everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic NETs with
disease progression. The search strategy was developed in MEDLINE (Ovid) and then adapted for use
in the other resources searched.
The bibliographic literature search was undertaken in May 2016 and the search was further updated in
September 2016.
Searching of bibliographic databases and databases of ongoing trials
The following bibliographic databases were searched: MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE In-Process & Other
Non-Indexed Citations (Ovid), MEDLINE Daily (Ovid), MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid),
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Wiley Interface) and Web
of Science (including Conference Proceedings Citation Index) (Thomson Reuters).
The search syntax took the following form: (search terms for neuroendocrine tumours) AND (search terms
for the interventions under review). The searches were not limited by study design, language or date.
The following trial registries were handsearched: Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) website and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website40 [including
European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs)].
The full search strategies are provided in Appendix 1.
Website searching
The following websites were searched:
l ENETS [www.enets.org/ (accessed 19 May 2016)]
l UKINETS [www.ukinets.org/ (accessed 19 May 2016)].
Deduplication
All references were exported into EndNote X7 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA), where
automatic and manual deduplication was performed.

Screening
Title and abstracts were independently double-screened by two reviewers. Studies meeting the inclusion
criteria at the title and abstract stage were ordered as full texts, which were independently double-screened
by three reviewers.
Citation searching, appraisal of company submissions and identification of systematic
reviews of randomised controlled trials
All studies meeting the full-text inclusion criteria were citation chased. Forwards citation searching was
conducted in Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and backwards citation searching was conducted
manually through the appraisal of the bibliographies of included studies. Citation searching is reported
in Appendix 1.
Included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from identified systematic reviews were checked against the
table of included studies for this review. Studies included in the clinical effectiveness sections of company
submissions were also checked against the table of studies included in this review.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of clinical effectiveness studies were defined exactly as per
the decision problem (see Chapter 3). Studies identified prior to the publication of the revised scope30 were
rechecked for inclusion against this revised scope.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the original and revised scope are summarised in Table 1. Studies
were also required to be in the English language.
The systematic review of clinical effectiveness focused only on RCTs. When no RCTs were identified
for an intervention of interest, a non-systematic review of non-randomised evidence was conducted
(see Appendix 2). Non-randomised evidence included prospective observational cohort studies
(both comparative and single-arm studies). Case reports were not included.
In addition to identifying RCTs, systematic reviews of RCTs, although not formally included in the
systematic review, were used as potential sources of additional references providing efficacy evidence.
Studies published as abstracts or conference presentations were included if they linked to included full-text
papers, in which appraisal of the methodology and an assessment of the results could be undertaken.
Data extraction and management
Studies included at the full-text stage were shared between three reviewers for the purposes of data
extraction. A standardised data specification form was used and extracted data were double-checked by a
second reviewer. When multiple publications of the same study were identified, data were extracted and
reported as if a single study.
Information sourced for extraction and tabulation included the study design and methodology, the
baseline characteristics of participants and the following outcomes; PFS, OS, RRs, AEs and HRQoL.
Definitions of the outcomes are provided in Chapter 1 (see Measurement of disease).
When information on key data was incomplete, we attempted to contact the study author(s). In addition,
the companies were approached through NICE and asked to provide missing data and supplementary
individual patient data.
Assessment of risk of bias
The methodological quality of each included study was assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second
reviewer, using criteria based on those proposed by the CRD for RCTs.38 An additional question (question 10;
see Table 4) was added to assess the applicability of the study to the NHS in England.

Methods of data analysis/synthesis
Data were tabulated and narratively synthesised. If sufficient evidence was available and study designs
were homogeneous, meta-analysis would be performed. In addition, when the data allowed, an indirect
treatment comparison (ITC) would be performed.
The study design and baseline characteristics for all included studies are presented, followed by the
outcome results. Outcomes from the studies are reported by tumour location, first for pNETs and then for
GI and lung NETs combined, as this was how the included studies were published. Additional data were
subsequently made available so that GI NETs and lung NETs could be assessed as isolated tumour locations.
Indirect treatment comparisons
When data were available, the Bucher et al.41 method was used for an ITC for the outcomes of PFS, OS,
RR and AEs. This method was best suited for this assessment given that the available data were only in
summary form and were limited to a handful of studies. More sophisticated methods were explored in the
economic analysis described in Chapter 6 using individual patient data, which highlight the limitations of
the Bucher et al.41 method, but resource limitations prevented this evidence being incorporated in the
clinical effectiveness review. Further details can be found in Indirect treatment comparison: pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumours.
Results
The results of study identification in accordance with the updated NICE scope are discussed first in this
section, followed by a description of the quality of the evidence and overview tables of the included trials.
When available, outcomes (PFS, OS, RRs, HRQoL and AEs) are then reported by tumour location and by
subgroup. The subgroups considered were based on the NICE scope (see ‘Other considerations’ in
Table 1).
When non-randomised evidence was sought, details are presented after the RCT evidence. These data are
tabulated and narratively discussed in brief.
Quantity and quality of research available (randomised controlled trial evidence)
Studies identified
Titles and abstracts were screened for 6209 unique references identified by the searches, after which
273 full-text papers were retrieved for detailed consideration. A total of 217 full texts were excluded
(a table of these excluded references, along with the reasons for exclusion can be found in Appendix 3).
The Cohen’s kappa for full-text screening was 0.579 [standard error 0.045, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.491 to 0.667].
Update searches were conducted in September 2016. A total of 645 references were identified and
25 were selected for full-text retrieval. Of these, six citations were formally included in the review.
Six systematic reviews42–47 were retained for scrutiny and three trials were included in the review: RADIANT-3
(four full texts34,48–50 and 22 abstracts51–72), RADIANT-4 (one full text35 and eight abstracts73–80) and A6181111
(one full text,81 19 abstracts82–100 and erratum to the full text81). Following scrutiny of the included studies
from the six systematic reviews, no further evidence was identified. A table of all of the included citations is
provided in Appendix 4.
Of note, two citations related to a study by Yao et al.101 This study met our inclusion criteria; however,
it was excluded as the paper was retracted because ‘the authors discovered statistical errors which need
further validation’. The study compared everolimus (n = 44) with placebo (n = 35) in Chinese patients
with pNETs.

No randomised studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review for clinical
evidence for the following interventions and comparators:
l 177Lu-DOTATATE compared with any of the included comparators
l everolimus compared with interferon alpha or chemotherapy
l sunitinib compared with interferon alpha or chemotherapy.
The AG ran an additional search (see Appendix 5 for the search strategy) with the aim of identifying
any RCTs that compared chemotherapy with BSC or placebo in the NETs population. Identified studies
would help inform discussions around the clinical effectiveness of the interventions in comparison to
chemotherapy through an ITC. Following the screening of 850 citations, no studies were identified. The
AG, on the advice from our clinicians, did not search for RCTs comparing interferon alpha with BSC or
placebo, as interferon alpha is not commonly used in UK clinical practice.
Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy trial
The NETTER-1 (Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy) trial102 was identified as an includable trial through four
published abstracts103–106 identified in the systematic review in accordance with the original NICE scope.
However, it was not included in this systematic review as it did not meet the revised inclusion criteria of
the updated scope issued by NICE on 18 August 2016.30
The NETTER-1 trial is a RCT that compares 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide long-acting release
(LAR) with 60 mg of octreotide LAR. Whether or not octreotide LAR could be deemed a concomitant
treatment, as the doses were different in each treatment arm, was explored.
The AG sought consultation from our clinicians, who were unable to confirm whether or not the different
dosing of octreotide LAR would result in different clinical effectiveness results. Therefore, the AG searched
for RCT dosing studies (see Appendix 5 for the search strategy) to ascertain whether or not 30 mg of
octreotide LAR had the same clinical effectiveness as 60 mg of octreotide LAR in the NETs population.
Following screening of 180 citations, no studies were identified.
As the AG could not verify with any certainty that 30 mg of octreotide LAR had the same clinical
effectiveness as 60 mg of octreotide LAR, and octreotide LAR was not a comparator within the scope,
this study was excluded from the review.
Taken from the company submission,31 AAA reports that the rationale for treating the comparator arm
with a high dose of octreotide (60 mg) was as follows:
A higher dose was required by the regulatory authorities at the time of the parallel scientific advice
meeting with the FDA and EMA considering that the patients enrolled in the trial had have progressive
disease following 20 or 30 mg octreotide LAR, and it was not ethical to maintain them on the same
dose regimen. Consequently, 60 mg octreotide LAR at 4-week intervals dose was agreed for the
control arm in the absence of an alternative efficacious treatment approved for this type of tumour.
p. 4431
The AG appreciate that, as the only RCT of 177Lu-DOTATATE identified, this trial may be of interest to the
committee and so the main outcomes are presented in Appendix 6 along with the results of an ITC with
everolimus from RADIANT-4.35

Ongoing trials
The following trials registries were handsearched for ongoing trials: Current Controlled Trials,
ClinicalTrials.gov; the FDA website and the EMA website (including EPARs) (see Appendix 1 for the search
strategy). All searches were carried out in May 2016. Three trials were considered relevant to this review:
1. NCT02687958: Study of Everolimus as Maintenance Therapy for Metastatic NEC with Pulmonary or
Gastroenteropancreatic Origin. N = 30, currently recruiting, sponsored by the Gruppo Oncologico
Italiano di Ricerca Clinica.
2. NCT02358356: Capecitabine ON Temozolomide Radionuclide Therapy Octreotate Lutetium-177
NeuroEndocrine Tumours Study (CONTROL NETs). N = 165, currently not open for recruitment,
sponsored by the Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group.
3. NCT02230176: Antitumor Efficacy of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy With 177Lutetium
-Octreotate Randomized vs Sunitinib in Unresectable Progressive Well-differentiated Neuroendocrine
Pancreatic Carcinoma: First Randomized Phase II (OCCLURANDOM). N = 80, currently recruiting,
sponsored by Gustave Roussy, Cancer Campus, Grand Paris.
As two of the trials were investigating 177Lu-DOTATATE, the intervention that we were unable to provide
relevant RCT evidence for, we contacted the study organisers and received replies from both. The CONTROL
NETs trial is in progress and data are not expected until 2018/19. The OCCLURANDOM study has recruited
a total of 13 individuals and data are not expected to be ready before submission of this assessment report.

Study design and participant characteristics: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
This review includes the two trials that evaluated treatments in pNETs (RADIANT-334 – everolimus;
A618111181 – sunitinib). The characteristics of the study designs are summarised in Table 2. In both trials,
participants were randomised 1 : 1 to the intervention or placebo and BSC was given in both the intervention
arm and the placebo arm. Both trials measured the following outcomes: PFS, OS, RR (to include complete
response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease and ORR) and AEs. A618111181 also
reported HRQoL.
The primary end point was the same (PFS) for both trials. Median treatment duration was 4.6 months
in the treatment arm in A618111181 and (confidential information has been removed) in RADIANT-334 for
the treatment arm and (confidential information has been removed) for the placebo/BSC arm. Median
follow-up was reported to be 17 months for RADIANT-334 and 34.1 months for A6181111.81
A summary of information relating to drug administration is also provided in Table 2. The mean relative dose
intensity (RDI) of the active treatment was slightly lower in the everolimus studies (0.86 in RADIANT-334) than
in the sunitinib study (0.91 in A618111181). The use of SSAs was permitted in both treatment arms in both
trials. Treatment switching after disease progression (from placebo to active treatment) was allowed in
both trials.
The A6181111 trial was discontinued early following a recommendation from the safety monitoring
committee:
because of the greater number of deaths and serious adverse events in placebo group and the
difference in progression-free survival favouring sunitinib.
Raymond et al.81
The statistical power of the study was reduced because of the early termination of the trial. Only 171
individuals were randomised rather than the target of 340.
To achieve sufficient statistical power in RADIANT-3,34 it was estimated that 392 individuals would need
to be randomised to detect a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS. This target was reached as 410
patients were recruited and randomised to the study.
Population characteristics: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics for RADIANT-334 and A618111181 are reported in
Table 3.
RADIANT-334 and A618111181 recruited participants of a similar age (median age ranged from 56 to
58 years). There was a slightly higher proportion of men recruited to RADIANT-334 (53% to the everolimus
arm and 58% to the placebo arm) than to A618111181 (49% to the sunitinib arm and 47% to the
placebo arm). Both studies recruited individuals with pNETs only.
The functionality of the tumour was not reported in RADIANT-3,34 whereas A618111181 recruited a
mixture of functioning (> 30%) and non-functioning (≈50%) individuals (the functionality of the remaining
≈20% was not clarified).
A618111181 recruited individuals with well-defined or moderately defined tumours, whereas RADIANT-334
recruited around 80% of individuals with well-defined tumours, with the remainder having moderately
defined tumours.
RADIANT-334 measured performance status (PS) using the WHO PS score system, whereas A618111181
measured PS using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS system. Our clinicians suggested
that there is little difference between PS measured by either system. The majority of individuals had a PS

score of 0 in RADIANT-334 (66–67%), with the majority of the remaining individuals having a PS score of
1 (30–32%) and the remainder having a PS score of 2 (3%). A618111181 had a lower proportion of
individuals with a PS score of 0 (62% in the sunitinib arm and 48% in the placebo arm) and a higher
proportion of individuals with a PS score of 1 (38% in the sunitinib arm and 51% in the placebo arm) than
RADIANT-3.34 One individual was recruited with a PS score of 2 in the placebo arm; this was a protocol
deviation for A6181111.81
The proportions of individuals who had received previous treatments were variable between RADIANT-334
and A618111181 (see Table 3). Of particular note, SSA use prior to treatment was around 50% in
RADIANT-334 and between 35% and 38% in A6181111.81
Study design and participant characteristics: gastrointestinal and lung
neuroendocrine tumours
This review includes RADIANT-4,35 which evaluated everolimus in individuals with GI and lung NETs.
The characteristics of the study design are summarised in Table 2. Participants were randomised 2 : 1 to
everolimus or placebo. BSC was given in both the intervention (everolimus) arm and the placebo arm.
RADIANT-435 measured the following outcomes: PFS, OS, RR (to include complete response, partial
response, stable disease, progressive disease and ORR) and AEs. The primary end point was PFS. Median
treatment duration was 9.3 months in the everolimus arm and 4.5 months in the placebo arm. Median
follow-up was 21 months.
A summary of information relating to drug administration is provided in Table 2. The use of SSAs was
permitted in both treatment arms. Treatment switching (from placebo to active treatment) was not
allowed in RADIANT-4.35
For RADIANT-435 it was estimated that 285 individuals would need to be randomised at a ratio of 2 : 1.
This requirement was met as 302 individuals were randomised.
Population characteristics: gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics for RADIANT-435 are reported in Table 3.
The median age of participants ranged from 60 to 65 years in RADIANT-4.35 There was a slightly lower
proportion of men recruited to the everolimus arm (43%) than to the placebo arm (55%). Only individuals
with non-functioning, well-defined tumours were recruited to RADIANT-4.35 PS was measured using the
WHO PS scoring system. The majority of individuals had a PS score of 0 (73–75%), with the remaining
having a PS score of 1 (27–25%). The proportions of individuals who had received previous treatments
were variable between the arms (see Table 3).
Quality appraisal
The three identified RCTs were appraised for quality (Table 4). When necessary for clarification purposes,
published protocols available as online supplementary material for each of the main citations for the
three studies were referred to. For each trial, data from all publications for that trial contributed to the
quality appraisal.
Treatment allocation
Overall, the risk of bias was found to be the same in the three trials with regard to selection, performance,
detection, attrition and reporting bias. It was assessed that these trials demonstrated a low risk of bias.
RADIANT-3,34 A618111181 and RADIANT-435 all used a centralised internet or telephone registration system
for determining treatment allocation. RADIANT-334 and RADIANT-435 based their stratification on prognostic
factors (tumour location,35 WHO PS,34,35 previous chemotherapy use34 and previous SSA use35). A618111181
stratified by country/region only.

Similarity of groups
Baseline characteristics were predominantly similar between the two arms for all of the trials. However,
there were some differences between arms in the trials:
l RADIANT-334 – participants in the everolimus arm tended to have a shorter time from initial diagnosis
at baseline than participants in the placebo arm (6 months to < 2 years: 31% vs. 21% respectively;
2 years to ≤ 5 years: 26% vs. 40% respectively). The proportion of individuals with two disease sites
was higher in the everolimus arm than in the placebo arm (41% vs. 32%).
l A618111181 – there was a higher proportion of participants with an ECOG PS of 0 in the sunitinib arm
than in the placebo arm (62% vs. 48%), whereas the proportion of participants with a PS of 1 was
lower in the sunitinib arm than in the placebo arm (38% vs. 51%).
l RADIANT-435 – there was a higher proportion of women in the everolimus arm than in the placebo arm
(57% vs. 45%). In addition, fewer individuals had been treated with surgery prior to entering the study
in the everolimus arm than in the placebo arm (59% vs. 72%).
The difference in ECOG PS between arms in A618111181 is the difference most likely to affect the clinical
effectiveness results, with those receiving sunitinib having a proportionally better PS than those receiving
placebo. Otherwise, it was considered by the clinicians that these baseline differences between the
treatment arms were unlikely to affect significantly the clinical effectiveness outcomes reported in the trials.

Implementation of masking
RADIANT-3,34 A618111181 and RADIANT-435 were all double-blind trials and, as such, the participants,
investigators, site personnel and trial teams were blinded to the allocated treatment. In addition, central
reviews of tumour progression were carried out in both RADIANT-334 and RADIANT-4;35 these outcome
assessors were also blinded to treatment allocation. Information obtained from the protocols indicated
that both everolimus and placebo had an identical appearance, identical packaging and labelling and
an identical scheduling of administration in both RADIANT-334 and RADIANT-4.35 Information on the
appearance of the placebo medication was not provided for A6181111.81
It was assessed that there was a low risk of bias with regard to the blinding of outcome assessors,
participants and care providers.
Completeness of trial data
All a priori outcomes reported in the protocols were reported in the trial publications.34,35,81 Intention-to-treat
(ITT) analysis was carried out in each of the trials. Discrepancies in participant numbers in reports of AEs
were poorly explained in all three trials. Both RADIANT-334 and A618111181 included fewer participants in
their AE outcomes than the number of participants recruited, whereas RADIANT-435 included an additional
participant in the placebo arm who was not accounted for (n = 97 randomised and n = 98 reported for AEs).
It was assessed that there was a low risk of bias for the completeness of trial data from all three trials.
Generalisability
The populations evaluated by RADIANT-3,34 A618111181 and RADIANT-435 were all in line with the
licensed indication for each treatment and with the final scope issued by NICE.30 All of the studies were
multicentre studies including centres in both the UK and Europe. In total, 38% of the population in
RADIANT-334 were European, whereas 67% of the population in A618111181 were European. It was not
reported in RADIANT-435 what proportion of the population was European.
To assess the generalisability of the trials to the UK setting, the AG sought data on the prevalence of
NETs in the UK. There is limited information available on the current prevalence of NETs in the UK. In
October 2016, PHE9 published the first documentation of the incidences of and survival in NETs, based on
a cohort of 8726 neoplasms diagnosed in England in 2013–14.9
In the UK, NETs were described by PHE as having a 50 : 50 male-to-female ratio, with no obvious variation
by geographical region or ethnicity.9 In the three trials included here there was an average split for
male-to-female ratio, with the percentage of males recruited ranging from 43%35 to 58%.34
Public Health England9 deemed the age at which NETs are most prevalent to be similar to that for all other
malignant cancers. The age range of participants in the three trials appears to be younger (median age
ranging between 56 and 65 years) than the age range of the typical population with NETs in the UK.
Based on the very limited data available on what the UK demographic for people with NET constitutes,
it was assessed that all three trials had an unclear risk for the applicability of their results to the UK.

Outcomes from randomised controlled trial evidence for pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumours
Progression-free survival
In RADIANT-334 and A618111181 the primary outcome was PFS. Disease progression was defined by both
trials as the time from randomisation to the first evidence of progression or death from any cause.34,81
Both trials used the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.0107 to define disease
progression. In RADIANT-3,34 PFS was obtained from central radiology review and also local investigator
review, whereas in A618111181 PFS was obtained only from local investigator review in the published
paper.81 PFS from the assessment of an independent review was available from the company submission.33
In RADIANT-3,34 median PFS as assessed by central review was 11.4 months (95% CI 10.8 to 14.8 months)
in the everolimus plus BSC arm and 5.4 months (95% CI 4.3 to 5.6 months) in the placebo plus BSC arm.
Everolimus was associated with a 66% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for people
with pNETs compared with placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.44; Table 5].
In the submission from Pfizer,32 PFS from the assessment of an independent review was 12.6 months
(95% CI 11.1 to 20.6 months) for sunitinib plus BSC and 5.8 months (95% CI 3.8 to 7.2 months) for
placebo plus BSC. Sunitinib was associated with a 68% reduction in the risk of disease progression or
death for people with pNETs compared with placebo (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.55; see Table 5).
Locally assessed PFS in RADIANT-334 was 11.0 months (95% CI 8.4 to 13.9 months) in the everolimus plus
BSC arm compared with 4.6 months (95% CI 3.1 to 5.4 months) in the placebo plus BSC arm. Everolimus
was associated with a reduction (65%) in the risk of disease progression or death for people with pNETs
compared with placebo (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.45; see Table 5). The A618111181 trial reported
locally assessed PFS to be 11.4 months (95% CI 7.4 to 19.8 months) in the sunitinib plus BSC arm and
5.5 months (95% CI 3.6 to 7.4 months) in the placebo plus BSC arm. Sunitinib was associated with a
58% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for people with pNETs compared with placebo
(HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66; see Table 5). Both trials reported a shorter time for PFS in both arms for
locally assessed PFS than for central/independent review.
Kaplan–Meier curves for progression free survival Kaplan–Meier curves are presented for
RADIANT-334 (local and central review) and A618111181 (local review) in Figures 2 and 3 respectively.
Overall survival
Both of the pNET studies (RADIANT-334 and A618111181) reported some data relating to OS.
It was reported for RADIANT-334 that the OS data were immature: ‘median overall survival was not reached
at the time of this analysis . . . final analysis of overall survival will be performed once approximately
250 deaths have occurred’.
34 In addition, of the 203 people initially assigned to receive placebo in
RADIANT-3,34 172 (85%) received open-label everolimus and 148 (73%) crossed over from placebo to
everolimus following disease progression. By individuals crossing over from placebo to everolimus, the
detection of a treatment-related survival benefit is confounded in ITT analysis. In RADIANT-334 the HR for
OS was 1.05 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.55; see Table 5).
As it had not been reached, median OS was not reported for A6181111;81 instead, survival probability
at month 6 was reported. Survival was predicted to be higher in the sunitinib arm (92.6%, 95% CI
86.3% to 98.9%) than in the placebo arm (85.2%, 95% CI 77.1% to 93.3%). Survival was improved by
59% following sunitinib treatment compared with placebo (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.89; see Table 5).
Both companies [Novartis33 for everolimus (RADIANT-334) and Pfizer32 for sunitinib (A618111181)] presented
updated OS data in their submission.

For everolimus, the initial data presented in Yao et al.34 were analysed on 28 February 2010. In its submission,
Novartis33 presented interim OS analysis from 23 February 2011 and final OS analysis from 5 March 5. The
final OS data are also available in the published paper by Yao et al.48 At the interim time point, median
OS was still not reached in the everolimus plus BSC arm, but it was 36.63 months for the placebo plus
BSC arm (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.23). At the final OS time point, the median OS for everolimus plus
BSC was 44.0 months (95% CI 35.6 to 51.8 months) and for placebo plus BSC was 37.68 months (95% CI
29.1 to 45.8 months), indicating an overall improvement in median OS of 6.3 months (HR 0.94, 95% CI
0.73 to 1.20; p = 0.30; see Table 5). In its submission, Novartis33 commented that ‘the results may be
confounded due to the high level of treatment switching from placebo to everolimus and the receipt of
subsequent anti-neoplastic therapies’ (p. 43). Novartis accounted for the treatment switching from placebo
to everolimus using the rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) model. The RPSFT results are shown
in Appendix 7 (see Table 49) and suggest a 40% reduction in OS with everolimus compared with placebo
(HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.95).

Additional OS data were also available in the submission from Pfizer32 (pp. 45–9). Pfizer performed final OS
analysis in A618111181 after 5 years of follow-up post study closure. From the ITT population, median OS
was 38.6 months (range 25.6–56.4 months; n = 55 deaths) in the sunitinib plus BSC arm and 29.1 months
(range 16.4–36.8 months; n = 58 deaths) in the placebo plus BSC arm, an improvement of 9.5 months
(HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.06; p = 0.094; see Table 5). After accounting for treatment switching using
the RPSFT method, median OS in the placebo group (if the 69% of patients who crossed over to sunitinib
had remained on placebo) was estimated as 13.2 months (range 11.3–16.5 months) (HR 0.34, 95% CI
0.14 to 1.28; p = 0.094) (it should be noted that the 95% CI was also reported as 0.15 to 1.28 in the
company submission).
Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival Kaplan–Meier curves for OS and RPSFT-adjusted OS were
presented for both RADIANT-334 (see Appendix 7, Figure 29, and Figure 4 respectively) and A618111181
(see Appendix 7, Figure 30, and Figure 5 respectively).
Response rate
Both studies used RECIST version 1.0107 to assess tumour response. Response rate was assessed by local
investigators in RADIANT-3.34 It was unclear whether response rate was assessed locally or centrally in
A6181111;81 however, as PFS was assessed only locally,81 it might be assumed that the response rate was
also assessed locally. In A618111,81 clinical assessments were performed at screening, during weeks 5 and
9 and every 8 weeks thereafter, whenever progression was suspected and at the end of treatment or
withdrawal from the study, whereas in RADIANT-334 assessments were performed at baseline and every
12 weeks thereafter.
Complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease were reported by both studies
(see Table 5). In RADIANT-334 tumour shrinkage was also reported, whereas in A618111181 the proportion
of individuals who could not be evaluated and ORR were also reported (see Table 5). Complete response
was achieved by only two individuals in A618111181 following treatment with sunitinib and BSC. Complete
response was not achieved by any participants receiving placebo (both trials), nor following treatment with
everolimus (RADIANT-334). The numbers of individuals achieving a partial response or stable disease were
higher in the treatment arms (everolimus and sunitinib) than in the placebo arms in both trials. Likewise,
there were higher proportions of individuals with progressive disease in the placebo arms than in the
treatment arms.

Novartis33 reported in its submission that (confidential information has been removed). Novartis33 also
reported central investigator RRs and adjudicated central investigator RRs from RADIANT-3.34
Although relevant outcome data were reported, this information was designated as commercial-in-confidence.
Adverse events
In both RADIANT-334 and A618111181 AEs were assessed in accordance with the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.108
Treatment-related AEs (all grades and grades 3 and 4 combined) are reported for both trials in Table 6.
In RADIANT-3,34 AEs were reported that occurred in at least 10% of the safety population, whereas,
in A6181111,81 AEs were reported that occurred in > 15% of the safety population. AEs were more
commonly reported following treatment with everolimus and sunitinib than following treatment with
placebo. The five most common all-grade AEs following treatment with everolimus (RADIANT-334) were
stomatitis (64%), rashes (49%), diarrhoea (34%), fatigue (31%) and infections (23%). Following treatment
with sunitinib (A618111181), the five most common all-grade AEs were diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%),
vomiting (34%), asthenia (34%) and fatigue (32%).
Treatment-related AEs occurring in ≥ 20% of patients in RADIANT-334 at the latest cut-off (5 March) were
presented in the company submission from Novartis33 (see Appendix 7, Table 50). These AE rates are different
(predominantly higher) from the rates published by Yao et al.34 The AEs published in the paper by Yao et al.34
were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 16.1.109
Health-related quality of life
IN A618111181 the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
(EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0 was used to measure HRQoL. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was available for 73 out
of 86 (85%) individuals treated with sunitinib and 71 out of 85 (84%) individuals treated with placebo. The
EORTC QLQ-C30 includes one global health scale, five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive
and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain) and six single-item scales (dyspnoea,
insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties). High scores are better for the global
and functioning scales, whereas low scores are better for the symptom items/scales. The questionnaire was
administered at baseline, at every cycle (4 weeks) and at the end of treatment. There were no overall
differences observed between study groups for any of these measures except for diarrhoea (21.4-point
difference; p < 0.001) and insomnia (7.8-point difference; p = 0.04), which were higher in the sunitinib arm
than in the placebo arm.

More detailed results were available for HRQoL from Pfizer’s submission.32 The mean baseline global HRQoL
score was 67.0 (95% CI 62.0 to 72.0) in the sunitinib plus BSC arm compared with 64.0 (95% CI 58.4 to
69.6) in the placebo plus BSC arm. Post-baseline scores were 62.44 for sunitinib and 61.28 for placebo.
Overall differences in the EORTC QLQ-C30 for each item on the scale between the two arms are shown
in Table 53 (see Appendix 7). Changes in global HRQoL scores over time in the two arms are shown in
Figure 31 (see Appendix 7).
Subgroup analysis
Progression-free survival A618111181 reported Cox proportional hazards analysis of PFS for the subgroups
tumour functioning, number of previous systemic regimes and previous use of SSAs (see Appendix 7,
Table 54), whereas RADIANT-334 reported PFS for subgroups based on tumour grade, previous chemotherapy
use and previous long-acting SSA use (see Appendix 7, Table 55).
Overall survival Novartis (A618111181) also reported covariate analysis of OS using a Cox’s proportional
hazards model for previous use of SSAs and previous use of chemotherapy (see Appendix 7, Table 56).
Indirect treatment comparison: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
Two RCTs were used to compare everolimus with sunitinib: RADIANT-334 (everolimus plus BSC vs. placebo
plus BSC) and A618111181 (sunitinib plus BSC vs. placebo plus BSC; Figure 6).
The Bucher method41 was used to indirectly compare everolimus with sunitinib in individuals with pNETs
for the following outcomes: PFS, OS, RR (not including complete response as there were zero responses in
both treatment arms of RADIANT-334 and a zero response in the placebo arm of A618111181) and various
AEs. Because there were only two relevant trials for this synthesis we could not undertake any analyses for
heterogeneity between the trials or inconsistency in the network. As we used only aggregate summary
data, other more complex methods of indirect comparison were not considered [e.g. matched adjusted
indirect comparisons (MAICs) using individual patient data]. After we had conducted these analyses, the
AG requested individual patient data from the companies, and obtained data on the A618111181 trial,
for the purposes informing de novo economic analysis. However, limited resources prevented us from
updating the indirect comparison reported in this section using matched adjusted Bucher methods.
Results for PFS and OS are reported in terms of HRs and 95% CIs, whereas results for RR and AEs are
reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. For some AEs, when there were zero events in one of the
arms, a continuity correction of 0.5 was added to each of the 2 × 2 cells to allow calculation of the ORs.
An assessment of the characteristics of the two trials (RADIANT-334 and A618111181) suggested that they
were comparable to allow an ITC. Both trials compared the active treatment with placebo plus BSC and
included only participants with advanced or metastatic disease. A slightly higher proportion of participants
used SSAs in RADIANT-334 (≈40%) than in A618111181 (≈28%); however, it was not thought that this
would affect the relative effectiveness of the treatments.

Treatment switching from the active arm to the placebo arm was permitted in both trials after disease
progression. For OS, ITCs were conducted using ITT analyses and analyses adjusted for treatment switching
(using the RPSFT method). Methods other than the RPSFT were considered by one of the companies
A6181111,81 including the inverse probability of censoring weights. The RPSFT method relies on the
common treatment effect assumption, that is, that the effectiveness of targeted treatment is the same in
patients in the targeted intervention arm and patients in the control arm who switch over to the targeted
treatment on disease progression. This assumption was considered to pose less practical problems than the
inverse probability of censoring weights method, which requires censoring of the data at the time of
crossover and adjusting the remaining data using all relevant confounders affecting both the decision to
switch and the outcome (PFS, OS).
Progression-free survival
Table 7 shows the evidence used from RADIANT-334 and A618111181 to inform the indirect comparison
between everolimus and sunitinib for PFS assessed by local review. The analysis suggests that everolimus
is associated with a 17% decrease in disease progression or death compared with sunitinib (HR 0.83,
95% CI 0.49 to 1.42). The 95% CI is wide and includes the null hypothesis that there is no difference in
PFS effectiveness between everolimus and sunitinib.
Further data available from the company submissions32,33 enabled an indirect comparison for PFS assessed
by central radiology review to be carried out. The ITC between everolimus and sunitinib for PFS based on
central radiology review suggests no difference between the treatments (see Table 7).
Overall survival
Table 7 shows the evidence used to inform the indirect comparison between everolimus and sunitinib for OS.
The analysis suggests that there is a 2.56 times greater hazard of dying associated with treatment with
everolimus than treatment with sunitinib, which is statistically significant. However, as these analyses are

based on published HRs from RADIANT-334 and A6181111,81 which were not adjusted for treatment
switching after disease progression, these results should not be relied on.
Final follow-up data for OS available from the company submissions32,33 enabled an indirect comparison
between everolimus and sunitinib for this outcome to be carried out, which suggests a lower hazard of
death associated with sunitinib than with everolimus. However, the 95% CI includes the null effect,
suggesting that this is not a statistically significant effect (see Table 7). This analysis does not account for
the fact that approximately 70% of participants in the placebo plus BSC arms of these two trials switched
to receive the active treatment after disease progression and so it should be interpreted with caution.
Overall survival accounting for treatment switching using the rank-preserving structural failure
time method The indirect comparison of everolimus with sunitinib for OS in which the companies have
used the RPSFT method to adjust for treatment switching suggests a lower hazard of death associated
with sunitinib than with everolimus (as in the ITT analyses above); however, the 95% CI is very wide and
includes the null effect (see Table 7).
Response rate
All ORs reported in Table 7 for the intervention compared with placebo were calculated by the AG, based
on the numbers of individuals reported to have experienced the different outcomes in RADIANT-334 and
A6181111.81 The ITCs for everolimus and sunitinib were based on the AG-calculated ORs from RADIANT-334
and A6181111.81 The indirect analysis suggests that there is an 82% increase in the odds of a partial
response in individuals treated with sunitinib compared with everolimus. However, sunitinib was associated
with a 52% increase in the odds of progressive disease compared with everolimus. Everolimus was
associated with a 2.3 times greater odds for disease stability than sunitinib. However, all of these ITCs
were associated with wide 95% CIs, suggesting that there is little evidence of a difference in RRs between
everolimus and sunitinib.
Adverse events
An ITC was completed only for those AEs for which data were available from both trials. All ORs reported
in Appendix 7 (see Table 57 for all grades of AE and Table 58 for grade 3/4 AEs) were calculated by the AG
based on the numbers of participants experiencing these AEs reported in A618111181 and RADIANT-3.34 For
all grades of AE, the ITC suggests that there is a 19% increase in the odds of experiencing stomatitis and
a 42% increase in the odds of experiencing nausea associated with sunitinib compared with everolimus.
For the other AEs (all grades), the evidence suggests an increase in the odds of experiencing the AE with
everolimus compared with sunitinib. However, except for decreased appetite, all of these ITCs were
associated with wide 95% CIs that included the null hypothesis of no difference, suggesting that there is
little evidence of a difference in AEs between everolimus and sunitinib. For all grades of decreased appetite,
there was a statistically significant increase in the odds of experiencing the event with everolimus compared
with sunitinib.
For the grade 3/4 AEs, the ITC could consider only seven AEs based on the data available from the two
trials. The evidence suggests an increased odds of experiencing grade 3/4 stomatitis, fatigue, diarrhoea,
nausea and thrombocytopenia with everolimus compared with sunitinib and an increased odds of
experiencing decreased appetite and asthenia with sunitinib compared with everolimus. However, all of
the ITCs for grade 3/4 AEs were associated with wide 95% CIs that included the null hypothesis of no
difference, suggesting that there is little evidence of a difference in AEs between everolimus and sunitinib.
Subgroup analysis
Subgroup analysis based on whether or not participants had previously received SSAs suggests very little
difference in time to disease progression or death for everolimus compared with sunitinib (see Appendix 7,
Table 59).

Outcomes from randomised controlled trial evidence for gastrointestinal and lung
neuroendocrine tumours
Progression-free survival
In RADIANT-4,35 PFS was the primary outcome, with disease progression defined as ‘the time from
randomisation to death or progression as per modified RECIST version 1.0 criteria’.
35 In RADIANT-4,35
PFS was reported according to both central radiology review and local investigator review.
Median PFS in RADIANT-4,35 assessed by central review, was 11.0 months (95% CI 9.2 to 13.3 months)
in the everolimus plus BSC arm and 3.9 months (95% CI 3.6 to 7.4 months) in the placebo plus BSC arm.
Everolimus was associated with a 52% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for people
with lung and GI NETs compared with placebo (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67; Table 8).
In RADIANT-4,35 locally assessed PFS was longer in duration in both arms than PFS assessed by central
review, at 14.0 months (95% CI 11.2 to 17.7 months) in the everolimus plus BSC arm compared with
5.5 months (95% CI 3.7 to 7.4 months) in the placebo plus BSC arm. Everolimus was associated with a
reduction (61%) in the risk of disease progression or death for people with lung and GI NETs compared
with placebo (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.54; see Table 8).
The company submission from Novartis33 made available secondary analysis of PFS (1 year and 2 days after
the PFS analysis presented in the published paper35). Median PFS from central review was 14.39 months
(95% CI 11.24 to 17.97 months) for the everolimus plus BSC arm and 5.45 months (95% CI 3.71 to
7.39 months) for the placebo plus BSC arm. Everolimus was associated with a 59% reduction in the risk of
disease progression or death for people with lung and GI NETs compared with placebo (HR 0.41, 95% CI
0.30 to 0.56).
Kaplan–Meier curves were produced for PFS in RADIANT-435 from both central review and local review
(Figure 7) with data from the primary cut-off point.
Overall survival
Interim OS analysis was carried out for RADIANT-435 once 70 deaths had been reached. Data were not
sufficiently mature to provide an estimation of median OS. In individuals with lung and GI NETs,
Kaplan–Meier estimates for OS at the 25th percentile – 25% of individuals having died – were 23.7 months
(95% CI 17.6 to 27.3 months) for everolimus and 16.5 months (95% CI 9.0 to 21.0 months) for placebo.
Everolimus was associated with a 36% improvement in OS for individuals with lung and GI NETs compared
with placebo (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.05; see Table 8).
In its company submission, Novartis33 presented secondary analysis of OS from RADIANT-4,35 which was
performed 1 year and 2 days after the published analysis presented by Yao et al.35 This analysis was based
on 101 deaths, corresponding to a 52.9% information fraction, and the median duration of follow-up was
33.4 months. Everolimus was associated with a 27% improvement in OS for individuals with lung and GI
NETs compared with placebo (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.11).
A Kaplan–Meier plot was produced for OS in RADIANT-435 at both the primary data cut-off point
(see Appendix 7, Figure 32) and the secondary data cut-off point (Figure 8).
Response rate
In RADIANT-4,35 a modified version of RECIST version 1.0107 was used to assess tumour response by central
radiology review. Efficacy was assessed every 8 weeks following randomisation for the first 12 months and
then every 12 weeks thereafter.
Complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, ORR, disease control rate and
tumour shrinkage, following central radiology review, were reported (see Table 8). For all RR outcomes,

treatment with everolimus for lung and GI NETs resulted in a favourable response compared with
treatment with placebo, except for complete response, which was not achieved in either arm.
Adverse events
In RADIANT-435 AEs were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.111 Treatment-related AEs (all grades and grades 3 and 4
combined), reported in ≥ 10% of the safety population, are presented in Table 9. AEs were more
commonly reported following treatment with everolimus than following treatment with placebo. The five
most common all-grade AEs following treatment with everolimus were stomatitis (63%), diarrhoea (31%),
fatigue (31%), infections (29%) and rash (27%).
In its submission, Novartis33 also reported AEs in patients regardless of the study drug relationship of the
safety population. This table can be found in Appendix 7 (see Table 51).

Health-related quality of life
In its submission, Novartis33 presented data on HRQoL from RADIANT-435 using the Functional Assessment
of Cancer Therapy – General (FACT-G) questionnaire.112 The FACT-G is based on 27 items in four domains:
physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being and functional well-being. Participant
completion rates for the FACT-G questionnaire in RADIANT-4 are provided in Table 60 (see Appendix 7).
Mean total score over time for the FACT-G questionnaire is presented in Figure 34 (see Appendix 7). The
HR for definitive deterioration of the total FACT-G score was (confidential information has been removed)
Figure 34 (see Appendix 7).
In its submission, Novartis33 reported that the ‘scores were well-balanced between the two arms and never
exceeded the threshold of 7 points, defined as the minimal clinically important difference between
treatment arms’ (p. 77).
Subgroup analysis
Progression-free survival (based on central review) in RADIANT-435 was reported for everolimus compared
with placebo based on treatment naivety, previous chemotherapy use and previous long-acting SSA use
(see Appendix 7, Table 61). There is little evidence of a difference in PFS within subgroups.
Outcomes from randomised controlled trial evidence for gastrointestinal
neuroendocrine tumours
Following a data request to Novartis, some of the outcomes from RADIANT-435 were provided for
individuals with GI NETs alone and for individuals with lung NETs alone. The following sections report the
baseline characteristics and outcomes provided by Novartis for individuals with GI NETs from RADIANT-4.35
Tumour locations included under the GI umbrella were stomach, colon, rectum, appendix, caecum, ileum,
duodenum, jejunum and small intestine.
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics for individuals with GI NETs only are presented in Table 62 (see Appendix 7).
Progression-free survival
Novartis provided data for PFS from the RADIANT-435 trial for patients with GI NETs. Median PFS assessed
by central review was 13.1 months (95% CI 9.2 to 17.3 months) for the everolimus plus BSC arm and
5.4 months (95% CI 3.6 to 9.3 months) for the placebo plus BSC arm. Everolimus was associated with a
44% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for people with GI NETs compared with placebo
(HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84; see Table 8).
Overall survival
Novartis provided data for OS and Kaplan–Meier estimates of OS at the 25th percentile from the
RADIANT-435 trial for patients with GI NETs (see Table 8).
Response rate
Novartis provided data for RRs from RADIANT-435 for patients with GI NETs (see Table 8).
For all RR outcomes, treatment with everolimus plus BSC for GI NETs resulted in a favourable response
compared with treatment with placebo plus BSC.
Adverse events
Novartis provided data for AEs from RADAINT-4 for individuals with GI NETs. AEs were more commonly
reported following treatment with everolimus than following treatment with placebo (Table 10). The five
most common all-grade AEs following treatment with everolimus were stomatitis (71.8%), infections
(59%), diarrhoea (44.4%), peripheral oedema (40.2%) and fatigue (36.8%).

Following a data request to Novartis, some of the outcomes from RADIANT-435 were provided for
individuals with lung NETs alone. The following sections report the baseline characteristics and outcomes
provided by Novartis for the individuals with lung NETs only from RADIANT-4.35
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics for individuals with lung NETs only are reported in Table 63 (see Appendix 7).
Progression-free survival
Novartis provided data for PFS from the RADIANT-435 trial for patients with lung NETs. There were
42 progression events for 63 individuals assigned to everolimus plus BSC compared with 18 events for
27 individuals in the placebo plus BSC arm. Everolimus was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of
disease progression or death for people with lung NETs compared with placebo (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to
0.88; see Table 8).

Overall survival
Novartis provided data for OS from the RADIANT-435 trial for patients with lung NETs (see Table 8).
HRs were obtained from the unstratified Cox model.
Response rate
Novartis provided data for RRs from RADIANT-435 for patients with lung NETs (see Table 8).
For all RR outcomes, treatment with everolimus plus BSC for lung NETs resulted in a favourable response
compared with treatment with placebo plus BSC.
Adverse events
Novartis provided data for AEs from RADIANT-4 for individuals with lung NETs. AEs were more commonly
reported following treatment with everolimus than following treatment with placebo (see Appendix 7,

Summary
Summary of the clinical effectiveness systematic review
l Of 6209 titles/abstracts screened, three trials met the inclusion criteria for the clinical effectiveness
systematic review.
l The three trials were reported in 56 citations (six full texts, one errata and 49 conference abstracts).
l The risk of bias within the trials was low and was found to be the same within the three studies with
regard to selection, performance, detection, attrition and reporting bias.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
l Two trials provided evidence on the effectiveness of everolimus (RADIANT-332) and sunitinib
(A618111145) in the treatment of pNETs. Both interventions were compared with placebo. BSC was
also given in both the intervention arm and the placebo arm in both trials.
l Median PFS, assessed by central review, was 11.4 months for everolimus34 and 12.6 months for
sunitinib81 compared with 5.4 months and 5.8 months, respectively, in the placebo arms of the trials.
Locally assessed PFS was also reported.
l In the first publication for each trial, median OS was not reached or data were immature. Longer
follow-up data were available from company submissions.32,33 Median OS was 44.0 months for everolimus34
and 38.6 months for sunitinib81 compared with 37.7 months and 29.1 months, respectively, in the placebo
arms. Treatment switching from the placebo arm to the treatment arm (73% in RADIANT-334 and 69% in
A618111181) significantly compromises the OS results.
l Tumour response rates were assessed locally for RADIANT-334 and were assumed to be locally assessed
in A6181111.81 Complete response was achieved by only two individuals receiving sunitinib;81 complete
response was not achieved in any of the other arms. Both trials reported higher rates for partial
response and stable disease and lower rates for progressive disease in the treatment arms (everolimus
and sunitinib) than in the placebo arms.
l Overall, AEs were more commonly reported following treatment with everolimus and sunitinib than
following with placebo. The five most common all-grade AEs following treatment with everolimus34
were stomatitis (64%), rashes (49%), diarrhoea (34%), fatigue (31%) and infections (23%). Following
treatment with sunitinib,81 the five most common all-grade AEs were diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%),
vomiting (34%), asthenia (34%) and fatigue (32%).
l Health-related quality of life was assessed in A618111181 (sunitinib) using the EORTC QLQ-C30. There
were no overall differences between study groups, except for diarrhoea (21.4-point difference) and
insomnia (7.8-point difference), which occurred with a higher frequency in the sunitinib arm than in
the placebo arm. HRQoL data were not collected in RADIANT-3.34

Indirect treatment comparison: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
l RADIANT-334 and A618111181 were used to compare everolimus with sunitinib in an ITC using the
Bucher method.
l The ITC for PFS from central radiology review suggests no difference between the treatments (HR 1.06,
95% CI 0.57 to 1.97).
l The ITC for PFS from local review suggests that everolimus is associated with a 17% decrease in
disease progression or death compared with sunitinib (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.42). The 95% CI
is wide and includes the null hypothesis that there is no difference in PFS effectiveness between
everolimus and sunitinib.
l For OS, the ITC suggests that there is a 2.56 times greater hazard of dying associated with treatment
with everolimus than with sunitinib, which is statistically significant. However, as these analyses are
based on published HRs from RADIANT-334 and A6181111,81 which were not adjusted for treatment
switching after disease progression, these results should not be relied on.
l The ITC for OS, in which the companies have used the RPSFT method to adjust for treatment
switching, suggests a lower hazard of death associated with sunitinib than with everolimus (HR 1.76,
95% CI 0.20 to 15.78). However, the 95% CI is very wide and includes the null effect.
l For RRs, the ITC suggests that there is an 82% increase in the odds of a partial response in individuals
treated with sunitinib compared with individuals treated with everolimus. However, sunitinib was
associated with a 52% increase in the odds of progressive disease compared with everolimus.
Everolimus was associated with a 2.3 times greater odds of disease stability than sunitinib. However,
all of these ITCs were associated with wide 95% CIs, suggesting that there is little evidence of a
difference in RRs between everolimus and sunitinib.
l An ITC was completed only for those AEs for which data and events were available from both trials.
For all grades of AE, the ITC suggests a 19% increase in the odds of experiencing stomatitis and a
42% increase in the odds of experiencing nausea with sunitinib compared with everolimus. For rash,
fatigue, diarrhoea, dysguesia, epistaxis, loss of weight, thrombocytopenia, decrease in appetite,
headache, vomiting and asthenia (all grades), the evidence suggests an increase in the odds of
experiencing the AE with everolimus compared with sunitinib. However, except for decreased appetite,
all of these ITCs were associated with wide 95% CIs that included the null hypothesis of no difference,
suggesting that there is little evidence of a difference in AEs between everolimus and sunitinib. For all
grades of decreased appetite, there was a statistically significant increase in the odds of experiencing
the event with everolimus compared with sunitinib. For the grade 3/4 AEs, the ITC could consider only
seven AEs based on the data that were available from the two trials. The evidence suggests an
increased odds of experiencing grade 3/4 stomatitis, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea and thrombocytopenia
with everolimus compared with sunitinib and an increased odds of experiencing decreased appetite
and asthenia with sunitinib compared with everolimus. However, all of the ITCs for grade 3/4 AEs were
associated with wide 95% CIs that included the null hypothesis of no difference, suggesting that there
is little evidence of a difference in AEs between everolimus and sunitinib.
Gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
l One trial, RADIANT-4,35 provided evidence for the effectiveness of everolimus for treating GI and lung
NETs. The intervention was compared with placebo and both arms received BSC.
l Median PFS for RADIANT-435, assessed by central review, was 11.0 months for treatment with
everolimus and 3.9 months for treatment with placebo. Locally assessed PFS was also reported.
l Median OS was not reached. However, Kaplan–Meier estimates for OS at the 25th percentile were
23.7 months (95% CI 17.6 to 27.3 months) in the everolimus arm and 16.5 months (95% CI 9.0 to

Chapter 5 Critical appraisal of the
company submissions
Two companies submitted economic models to NICE: AAA and Novartis. Novartis submitted an
economic evaluation in patients with pNETs and, separately, in patients with GI and lung NETs. AAA
presented an economic evaluation in pNETs and another in midgut carcinoid tumours. The background
safety and efficacy evidence supporting the companies’ model submissions detailed model characteristics,
and results are presented in Appendix 8. Pfizer did not submit a cost-effectiveness model; it stated that:
Previous technology appraisals (SMC [Scottish Medicines Consortium] and AWMSG [All Wales Medicines
Strategy Group]) have challenged the data limitations relating to uncertainty associated with modelling
the clinical OS benefits of sunitinib in PNET due to the extensive treatment switching of patients in study
A6181111. Because A6181111 is the only clinical trial for sunitinib in this indication, the limitations in
the data for certain key model attributes remain. For these reasons, any cost-effectiveness evidence
submitted would continue to be associated with considerable uncertainty.
Pfizer submission, p. 8432
Novartis submission33
Economic evaluation of everolimus in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
Overview
In pNETs, the company evaluated everolimus plus BSC compared with sunitinib plus BSC. The company
based this analysis on an ITC of the results of RADIANT-3,34 a Phase III pivotal trial of 10 mg of everolimus
once daily plus BSC compared with placebo plus BSC, and A6181111,81 a Phase III RCT of sunitinib
(confidential information has been removed) plus BSC compared with placebo plus BSC. These RCTs were
the only available relevant evidence identified from a systematic review of RCTs and non-RCTs of everolimus,
sunitinib and 177Lu-DOTATATE for treating patients with advanced, metastatic or inoperable pNETs, and
177Lu-DOTATATE for treating advanced, metastatic or unresectable GEP NETs. The company did not provide
the reasons for omitting BSC from the analysis, for which head-to-head trial data were available compared
with each of the targeted treatments from RADIANT-334 and A6181111.81
The ITC of everolimus and sunitinib found no statistically significant differences in PFS and OS outcomes,
with estimated differences having wide CIs. The company found that everolimus was associated with a
lower frequency of grade 3/4 AEs and a different tolerability profile (see Chapter 4, Results).
Everolimus was found to dominate sunitinib. It generated lower discounted costs and more discounted
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), which were calculated on the assumption that the two treatments
produced the same mean PFS and OS. As the model assumed only two disease states, stable disease and
disease progression, and utilities in the latter state were assumed to be the same across treatments, the
QALY differences rested on the health state utility in stable disease under the two treatments, which in
turn reflected their differences in toxicity and AEs. Critically, these utility values were based on clinical
experts’ valuations of HRQoL descriptors (vignettes) of stable disease in general and the impact of
treatment-specific AEs, as opposed to HRQoL outcomes in actual patients.
Economic evaluation by the company
Novartis evaluated the costs and health benefits of everolimus plus BSC relative to sunitinib plus BSC in
advanced, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated pNETs patients with progressive disease from a
NHS or Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective. A semi-Markov model of monthly health state cycles
experienced by a patient cohort was used to synthesise the evidence on effectiveness, resource use, costs

and health state utilities, over a period of 20 years following the start of treatment. The main source of
evidence was an ITC of PFS, OS, concomitant SSA use, treatment duration and grade 3/4 AEs in the
A618111181 trial of sunitinib and the RADIANT-334 trial of everolimus (see Chapter 4, Indirect treatment
comparison: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, and Appendix 8, Novartis). The model consisted of three
health states, representing stable disease, disease progression and death, each associated with different
costs and utilities, as illustrated in Figure 9.
To allocate the distribution of patients across the health states for each treatment at a given point in the
modelled time, the rate of survival in the patient cohort as obtained from a parametric OS curve fitted
to the trial data was partitioned between the two alive health states using a parametric PFS curve also
estimated from the trial data for each treatment arm. Thus, in each treatment cycle the residual between
the OS and the PFS rates was used as the estimator for the proportion of patients in the progressive
disease phase.
The resource utilisation data were obtained from a survey of 32 clinical experts in the UK.113 Health state
utility values elicited for a set of vignettes describing health states in pNETs from a sample of members of
the general public were used for health states with and without AEs, as no HRQoL or utility data were
recorded in RADIANT-3.34 Sensitivity analyses adopted alternative values for the sunitinib arm derived from
HRQoL outcomes measured in the A618111181 trial of sunitinib compared with placebo.
The model accounts for the costs of subsequent treatments after disease progression by including a fixed
cost of radiotherapy, chemoembolisation and chemotherapy in the first cycle of the progressive disease
state of the model. Similarly, a fixed cost of end-of-life care is included on transition to the death state.
Results
In the advanced pNETs patients with progressive disease, the base-case analysis found a life expectancy of
4.17 years over a 20-year time horizon after the start of treatment with everolimus or sunitinib in patients
with a median age of 58 years (as in the everolimus arm of RADIANT-334). Everolimus produced more
QALYs than sunitinib (2.73 vs. 2.71, a difference of 0.02 QALYs discounted at 3.5%) (Table 11). As this
analysis assumed equal PFS and OS outcomes between the two treatments, the QALY difference was
purely the result of the impact on HRQoL of treatment differences in AEs.
Everolimus was associated with discounted health-care costs of £36,933 per patient, that is, an overall
saving of £1636 relative to sunitinib, which had discounted health-care costs of £38,569 per patient. With
a (confidential information has been removed) Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discount applied to the list

everolimus was reduced to (confidential information has been removed) and of using sunitinib was reduced
to £36,247, that is, a saving of (confidential information has been removed) per patient for everolimus. As
PFS, OS and costs in the progressive disease state were the same across the two arms, the cost differences
were the result of differences in the drug acquisition costs of the targeted therapies in the stable disease
period. As a result, everolimus was found to be dominant over sunitinib.
Novartis [table 6.18 ( p. 112) of the Novartis submission33] reports that the total cumulative time spent per
patient in the stable disease health state is 0.899 years under everolimus and 0.878 years under sunitinib.
This must be an error as the base-case model assumes equal PFS outcomes for both treatments and there
is no accounting in the model for differences in grade 5 AEs (deaths).
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) of drug acquisition prices unadjusted for the PAS produced a mean
cost saving estimate for everolimus of £2055 per patient and a QALY gain of 0.002. With the PAS, the
mean cost saving with everolimus was increased to (confidential information has been removed). This
result suggests that the main determining factor is costs, as the mean QALY difference of 0.002 is not
considered to be clinically significant.115 However, these PSAs by Novartis were not adequately performed
as the PFS and OS and SSA use (set at zero) parameter values were assumed to be the same rather than
differ between the treatments according to their mean estimates in the trial data and their associated
sampling uncertainty. Therefore, the claim by the company that ‘at the £30,000/QALY threshold, there is
(confidential information has been removed) probability of everolimus being cost-effective when compared
to sunitinib at their respective PAS prices’ (Novartis submission, p. 11433) should be considered with these
reservations in mind.
Consequently, deterministic sensitivity analysis performed by Novartis showed that the most influential
parameters are the relative treatment effects on PFS and OS, and the treatment duration, RDI and costs of AEs.
However, the company states that the incremental difference in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio (ICER) is ‘so marginal, it does not materially affect the model results’ (Novartis submission, p. 11633).
Similarly, positive rates of SSA use, use of PFS data assessed by local experts compared with centrally assessed
data and choice of PFS distribution had a marginal impact. In scenario analyses, exploring the effects of
changing clinical effectiveness, utility and cost parameter values, as well as structural assumptions about OS
and PFS outcomes, everolimus was still dominant, except for the case in which the relative treatment effect
on PFS was set to favour sunitinib according to estimates derived from the Bucher indirect comparison
(HR: PFS 0.93, OS 0.72). In this instance, everolimus had lower costs and produced fewer QALYs than
sunitinib and the ICER was found to be (confidential information has been removed). The interpretation of
the ICER in this case reverses, that is, the higher the value the more cost-effective everolimus is; it may be
reasonable to consider (confidential information has been removed) in this patient population. It must be
noted that this is the result of everolimus saving £5963 (confidential information has been removed) at the
expense of having 0.685 fewer QALYs per patient [table 6.23 (p. 117) of the Novartis submission33].
The scenarios explored by Novartis do not cover some major areas of uncertainty, such as variation in the
relative probability of AEs, nor structural uncertainty associated with different functional forms for the
different treatment arms in each of the progressive disease and stable disease phases. Nevertheless, given
the possibly clinically insignificant utility differences discussed earlier, or that Novartis may produce fewer

QALYs than sunitinib in exchange for a small reduction in NHS costs, the dominance of everolimus over
sunitinib in the Novartis base-case analysis is not robust to the sources of uncertainty investigated
by Novartis.
Strengths and weaknesses of Novartis’s evaluation of pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumours
The model by Novartis follows the NICE reference case37 (see Appendix 9) except for one major aspect,
which was the lack of inclusion of BSC as a comparator. This omission is at odds with the fact that the
two RCTs from which the effectiveness data were obtained for the model compared targeted therapy
(everolimus or sunitinib) plus BSC with placebo plus BSC. There was no justification given by Novartis for
omitting the BSC-only treatment option in its cost-effectiveness analysis. However, in the opinion of our
clinical experts, BSC is a relevant initial treatment option for patients with advanced, progressive pNETs and
small or asymptomatic tumours, in whom active treatment may be considered on disease progression.
This was a complex area to analyse because of limited data on advanced pNETs patients with progressive
disease, which is a natural result of the small incidence of this disease. Evidence on resource use was
particularly limited, especially for the progressive disease phase of the model, for which the quantities used
in the model were based on expert opinion. Another major uncertainty in the evidence base is the lack of
HRQoL data for everolimus in the patient population of interest here. This ultimately led Novartis to base
the comparison of HRQoL and, given the base-case assumptions of equal OS and PFS outcomes between
the treatments, QALY outcomes between the two treatments on their relative impact on AE incidence and
severity. Thus, the difference in QALYs was based on values derived from actual patient AE outcomes
complemented by clinical experts’ views of quality of life in stable disease under different AEs.
A critical feature of the OS data used in the Novartis economic model was the adjustment for crossover
from placebo to active treatment in the RCT data. In particular, the method used for such adjustment,
the RPSFT model, relied on the assumption that the benefit derived by patients from receiving targeted
treatment was the same whether they were given it as initial treatment or subsequently on disease
progression. This assumption may be questionable and it is therefore natural to expect that, in the present
case, sensitivity analyses allowing for a reduction in the benefit conferred by targeted treatment received
after disease progression should have been performed. Although other methods are available to adjust for
treatment crossover, such as inverse probability of censoring weight116 and censoring at crossover,117 they
are clearly inferior as the majority of cases of crossover in RADIANT-334 and A618111181 occurred following
study termination, making the key assumption underlying these methods, either that crossover is random or
that patients who did not cross over may be representative of those who did, unlikely to hold true.
The Bucher indirect comparison from which Novartis derived estimates of relative effectiveness and side
effects for populating its economic model was based on data that appear to be outdated on three fronts.
First, Novartis estimated relative OS effectiveness using an indirect comparison (Bucher method) of
placebo-adjusted HRs that corrected for crossover from the placebo to the active treatment arms in the two
RCTs used in the indirect comparison. The crossover-adjusted OS HR estimate used for sunitinib compared
with placebo in the indirect comparison by Novartis is lower than that in the final published results for OS
for A6181111.81 With these new data, we obtained a crossover-adjusted OS HR for everolimus compared
with sunitinib of 0.51, instead of the OS HR of 0.72 derived by Novartis. Second, our updated searches of
the literature conducted in September 2016 identified a forthcoming publication48 providing grade 3/4 AE
counts that differ in some instances from those used for the everolimus and placebo arms in the Bucher
indirect comparison submitted as evidence to NICE by Novartis. Third, some of the grade 3/4 AE data used
in the Novartis Bucher indirect comparison for the sunitinib and placebo arms were different from the
corresponding data submitted by Pfizer32 to NICE. When the Pfizer data are used instead, the pooled AE OR
estimated by Novartis as 4.47 changes to 1.37, thus reducing the differences in costs and disutilities of AEs
between sunitinib and everolimus.

The way that Novartis synthesised the effectiveness and safety evidence in its cost-effectiveness model
inadequately reflected the available information. The company’s base-case assumption was that the PFS
and OS outcomes of sunitinib and everolimus were the same, on the basis of wide CIs around the point
estimates of relative effectiveness. This practice is clearly inadequate because it misrepresents the level of
uncertainty in the data as evidence of lack of effect. This issue is made more serious in view of the
direction and extent of possible bias resulting from the use of inadequate data, discussed in the
previous paragraph.
In terms of model implementation, the limitations of the Novartis model analysis include the assumption
of the same treatment duration for everolimus and sunitinib. As pointed out earlier, the mean number
of treatment cycles of sunitinib is likely to be lower than that of everolimus, based on the Pfizer data32
submitted to NICE and comparison of median treatment durations in the main publications of A618111181
and RADIANT-3.34 On the other hand, Novartis did not account for the fact that the mean PFS (area under
the Kaplan–Meier curve) in the placebo arm of the A618111181 trial of sunitinib was lower than the mean
PFS of the placebo arm of the RADIANT-334 trial of everolimus. If treatment duration is proportional to PFS,
a fair indirect comparison with everolimus would require an increase in sunitinib treatment duration in
proportion to the magnitudes of PFS in the placebo arm of RADIANT-334 and PFS of the placebo arm
of A6181111.81
Another limitation was the implementation of subsequent treatment costs. In the partitioned survival
model used by Novartis the number of people who transitioned into progressive disease and who were
eligible to receive subsequent treatment was not obtainable from the model output and had to be
approximated using summary information reported in the trial about the number of people who were
censored, died before progression and experienced a PFS event. This approximation involved the strong
assumption of a constant relative frequency of these events throughout the PFS horizon.
Despite its limitations, the evidence presented by Novartis suggests that, with the currently available
information, the choice between sunitinib and everolimus hinges on their relative effects on PFS and OS
and drug acquisition costs and is subject to high levels of uncertainty related to clinical effectiveness. The
disutility of AEs is unlikely to be a significant factor in that choice and determining its importance is
hampered by the lack of data of sufficient quality for meaningful assessment.
Economic evaluation of everolimus in gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
Overview
The economic evaluation by Novartis of everolimus plus BSC compared with BSC alone in advanced,
progressive, well-differentiated, non-functioning GI and lung NETs was based on the effectiveness, safety
and quality of life evidence reported from a Phase III RCT, RADIANT-4.35 As in its economic evaluation in
pNETs, discussed in the previous section, Novartis relied on data from a resource use survey,113 which was
validated for the UK.
Economic evaluation by the company
Novartis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 10 mg of everolimus daily plus BSC relative to BSC alone in
patients with advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional GI and lung NETs. This evaluation
assessed costs, life-years and QALYs over a 30-year time horizon. For this purpose a three-health-state,
semi-Markov model of monthly cycles was used, populated with data from a partitioned survival analysis
of data from the RADIANT-435 Phase III trial of everolimus plus BSC compared with placebo plus BSC.
The model represented the disease course experience of a cohort of patients from the start of treatment,
starting from a stable disease phase, moving to a progressive disease phase at the time of disease
progression and, at any time in the disease course, facing the risk of death from any cause. The structure
was the same as that described in the Novartis pNETs model and that used by Ayyagari et al.118 in GI
locations (see Figure 9).

Results
Novartis reports that the life expectancy over a 30-year period for patients with advanced, progressive,
well-differentiated, non-functional GI and lung NETs is 5.79 life-years for 10 mg of everolimus daily plus
BSC compared with 4.77 life-years for BSC alone (Table 12). The respective total discounted costs are
expected to be £59,720 and £25,817 and the total QALYs produced are 4.28 and 3.51. This results in
an ICER of £43,642 per QALY gained for everolimus plus BSC compared with BSC alone. Under the
(confidential information has been removed) PAS discount on the everolimus price, the cost per QALY
gained with everolimus would be reduced to (confidential information has been removed). In total, 71%
of the QALY gain for everolimus plus BSC compared with BSC takes place in the stable disease state and
the share of the cost falling during the stable disease state is 98% at list prices. The costs of active initial
treatment with everolimus and BSC costs represent 79% and 8%, respectively, of the total incremental
costs of treatment with everolimus plus BSC. The mean PSA ICER for everolimus plus BSC compared with
BSC was £45,385 without the PAS and (confidential information has been removed) with the PAS.
Univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses found that the ICER was most sensitive to the choice of
distribution for extrapolating OS. The ICER varied from £39,571 to £59,832 with different OS distributions
and (confidential information has been removed) with the PAS. When treatment-specific utility values were
applied, the ICER increased to £56,385 and (confidential information has been removed) under the PAS.
The results were also sensitive to the RDI. Novartis also reports how extending the lifetime horizon and
extrapolating outcomes beyond the trial period improved the cost-effectiveness of everolimus.
From the results reported by Novartis it is evident that, in the analysis of the PAS, the (confidential
information has been removed) PAS discount was applied only to everolimus given as initial treatment, not
as subsequent treatment. In principle, the discount should have been applied to subsequent treatment too.
The company concluded that the ICER (confidential information has been removed). The company states
that the results should be considered within the context of unmet medical need for effective treatment
options in this heterogeneous and small patient population, with there being approximately 936 patients
in England across the two indications (pNETs and GI/lung) [table 3.1 (p. 27) of the Novartis submission33].
Strengths and weaknesses of Novartis’s evaluation of gastrointestinal and lung
neuroendocrine tumours
The economic evaluation by Novartis of everolimus in GI and lung NET patients relies on the quality of
RADIANT-4,35 which was the source of the effectiveness, AE and treatment duration and intensity data for
the model and rates of subsequent treatment use. A major limitation is the omission of relevant active
comparators, such as 177Lu-DOTATATE, in the analysis. Another limitation of the study design is the lack
of a separate analysis of lung and GI patients.
In terms of data, the main limitation is the lack of resource use data measured in a sample of patients. It is
not clear how robust the estimated costs of subsequent treatment use are likely to be, with issues such as
administrative censoring (i.e. from termination of the study), and, indeed, whether or not the differences
captured may have been an artefact of the length of follow-up.

In terms of evidence synthesis, the decision analysis relied on applying the same parametric survival
distributions for extrapolation to both arms, which may have unnecessarily restricted the modelling
capabilities in this study. Another issue was that, although crossover from everolimus to placebo was not
permitted in the trial, 10% (10/97) of patients in the placebo arm did cross over (four before and six after
unmasking). In spite of this, the analysis of OS data in RADIANT-435 did not adjust for such treatment
crossover. This limitation may slightly bias the results if the analysis is intended to inform the evaluation
of two alternative states of the world, one in which everolimus is provided as initial treatment and another
in which it is not provided at all. If instead the NICE decision is between choosing everolimus as initial
treatment or everolimus at the discretion of the physician as a potential subsequent treatment, the lack of
adjustment for crossover by Novartis may not need to be a source of bias per se.
Another minor limitation is the inaccuracy in estimating the costs of subsequent treatments in the Novartis
GI and lung model. This issue is the same as that discussed in the previous section for the Novartis model
in pNETs and is not repeated here.

Advanced Accelerator Applications submission31
Overview
In anticipation of European market authorisation, the company’s submission considers the use of the
radiolabelled SSA 177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq, equivalent to 200 mCi) for people with inoperable
progressive somatostatin receptor-positive GEP NETS. The company separates the GEP NETs population
into two subpopulations in the model:
1. (confidential information has been removed)
2. (confidential information has been removed).
Separation into these subpopulations was seen by AAA as appropriate as pNETs and GI NETs have
different clinical profiles and undergo different management. It is also important to note that with the
selection of this trial102 the population considered in the economic evaluations was further restricted
to the subpopulation of somatostatin receptor-positive (SSTR+) patients.
The comparators in the pNETs evaluation were everolimus (10 mg per day) and sunitinib (37.5 mg per day).
The comparator in the GI NETs evaluation was everolimus (10 mg per day) only. BSC was not offered as a
comparative strategy.
In the base-case analysis of pNETs the reported ICERs favoured 177Lu-DOTATATE over both included
comparators. The estimated cost per QALY gained for 177Lu-DOTATATE compared with everolimus was
(confidential information has been removed). In the comparison with sunitinib, 177Lu-DOTATATE was
estimated to be less costly and produce more QALYs and therefore dominated sunitinib.
In the base-case analysis of GI NETs, the reported ICER also favoured 177Lu-DOTATATE. The cost per
QALY gained compared with everolimus was estimated to be (confidential information has been removed).
Supportive arguments for these findings are not discussed except that it was stated that the result is driven
by superior survival with 177Lu-DOTATATE. The company did not draw comparisons with existing
published economic evidence as this is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of 177Lu-DOTATATE.

Economic evaluation by the company
The decision-analytic model is structured using a partitioned survival (‘area under the curve’) approach
based on a parametric extrapolation of Kaplan–Meier curves for baseline PFS and OS and HRs applied
proportionally through a 20-year time horizon. The evaluation utilises a three-health state cohort transition
model to simulate survival and progression (Figure 10). The selected cycle length is 1 month. Costs and
benefits were discounted at 3.5% in future years and are reported from the NHS/PSS and patient’s
perspective respectively.
Advanced Accelerator Applications conducted two mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) for the outcomes
of PFS and OS: one for pNETs comparing 177Lu-DOTATATE with everolimus and sunitinib, and one for GI
NETs comparing 177Lu-DOTATATE with everolimus (see Appendix 8, Advanced Accelerator Applications).
The sources of evidence of health effects in the pNETs evaluation were the NETTER-1 study102 for
octreotide LAR (baseline reference) and 177Lu-DOTATATE;102 RADIANT-334 for everolimus; and
A618111181 for sunitinib. The sources of evidence of health effects in the GI NETs evaluation were the
ERASMUS study for 177Lu-DOTATATE (Dutch pNETs subgroup) and RADIANT-435 for everolimus.
Result
Over a time horizon of 20 years, for people with inoperable progressive SSTR+ pNETs the use of
177Lu-DOTATATE was found to be cost-effective compared with both everolimus and sunitinib at a
threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained (Table 13).
Over a time horizon of 20 years, for people with inoperable progressive SSTR+ functional and non￾functional carcinoid midgut NETs (GI NETs) the use of 177Lu-DOTATATE was found to be cost-effective
compared with everolimus at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained (Table 14).
In a one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis in which individual parameter point estimates were varied to
their upper and lower 95% CI or interquartile range boundaries (or, when not available, ±20% of the mean):
l the 177Lu-DOTATATE acquisition cost and RDI adjustment were identified as highly sensitive model
input parameters
l PFS and post-progression survival (PPS) utility scores were identified as moderately sensitive
input parameters.
Uncertainty around the point estimates of input parameters in the deterministic analysis was explored in a
PSA. In 5000 iterations selected parameters were varied using conventional distributions. Parameters not
included in the PSA were relative treatment effect (PFS, OS), drug acquisition costs and drug administration
costs. The results revealed that PSA ICERs were consistently lower than deterministic ICERs (Table 15).
AAA offered no explanation for this discrepancy, which in theory may be due to an error in the PSA build
or the inclusion of one or more non-linear parameters in the model.

Summary results of scenario analyses
l Shortening the time horizon to 5 or 10 years reduced the ICERs, except for the 5-year comparison with
everolimus in GI NETs, in which the ICER increased to £23,334.
l Discounting of costs and benefits to 6% and 1%, respectively, decreased all ICERs.
l Increasing the 177Lu-DOTATATE dose intensity to 100% increased all ICERs (pNETs: vs. everolimus
£14,206 per QALY gained; pNETs: vs. sunitinib £29,686 per QALY gained; GI NETs: vs. everolimus
£26,386 per QALY gained).
l Using alternative sources of utility for pre-progression in GI NETs:
¢ using the NETTER-1 utility value (mean all patients: 0.750) rather than the utility value from Guy’s
and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (0.793) resulted in an ICER of £21,295 for 177Lu-DOTATATE
compared with everolimus
¢ using the ERASMUS utility value (GI NETs subgroup: 0.773) rather than the utility value from Guy’s
and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (0.793) resulted in an ICER of £20,931 for 177Lu-DOTATATE
compared with everolimus (not £20,136 as reported by AAA).
l Including palliative care costs and an end-of-life utility decrement in the last 4 weeks of life has a
negligible effect on ICERs in both the pNET and the GI NET evaluations.
l The inclusion of background mortality has a negligible effect on findings.

Strengths
l The analysis separated the evaluation of pNETs from the evaluation of GI NETs.
l The structural methodology followed recommended approaches and was implemented correctly.
The model was well presented, transparent and generally straightforward to understand.
l Serious AEs were incorporated, albeit poorly.
l The model was found to contain only minor errors in wiring, which could effectively be overlooked.

Weaknesses
l No comparison was made with a strategy of BSC.
l The MTCs used to inform the relative treatment effect in each of the evaluations were premised on
crucial yet unjustified assumptions:
¢ that 60 mg of octreotide can be assumed to be equivalent to placebo and placebo plus 30 mg of
octreotide in the GI NETs network
¢ that 60 mg of octreotide is equivalent to placebo and placebo plus BSC in the pNETs network
¢ that data from the NETTER-1 trial102 can be used to inform the network for pNETs even though no
participants in the NETTER-1 trial had pNETs.
l The MTCs used to inform the relative treatment effect in each of the evaluations were premised on
weak methodology:
¢ RADIANT-2119 should be not have been included in the GI NETs MTC as the population in this trial
all had functioning tumours, which is outside the marketing licence for everolimus for GI NETs
¢ NETTER-1 should not have been included in the pNETs MTC as this trial did not include any
patients with pNETs, meaning that AAA’s pNETs evaluation is tenuous
¢ there was no consideration of the extent of treatment switching in RADIANT-2 (58% switched
to active treatment), RADIANT-334 (73% switched to active treatment) and A618111181
(69% switched to active treatment), which limits the interpretation of the results for OS.
l Treatment after progression was oversimplified to octreotide across all strategies, which was continued
until death.
l Treatment with everolimus and sunitinib was assumed to continue until disease progression. This is an
overestimate of usage and therefore cost as the average duration of treatment in trials was a fraction
of this period.
l The pNETs evaluation relied on non-randomised evidence for baseline estimates of PFS and OS.
l The resource requirement for the administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE was underestimated given that
current practice as described by the AG clinical experts is for an overnight stay rather than day case
administration and that there is a greater time requirement from clinical specialists. No alternative
estimates of drug administration costs were tested. Exploratory univariate variations in the cost of
177Lu-DOTATATE administration carried out by the AG revealed that this may be an important area
for scrutiny.
l The costing of serious adverse events (SAEs) was implemented poorly. On the one hand, costs were
underestimated because of an overly low unit costing of SAEs, most of which require attention in the
hospital setting, and, on the other hand, they were overestimated by their application well beyond the
expected mean duration of treatment.

Chapter 6 Independent economic assessment
Methods
Model structure
Structure of relevant published models
In Table 16 we present the key aspects of published models from the studies included in our systematic
review of the cost-effectiveness of drugs for treating NETs (see Appendix 10 for details). For comparison,
we include characteristics of the Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG) model.
Structure of the Peninsula Technology Assessment Group model
The majority of the studies, selected during the systematic review of cost-effectiveness (see Chapter 5,
Novartis submission), reported models with three health states. The study by Casciano et al.120 reported a
four-state model, distinguishing patients with and without symptoms in the stable disease state. However,
in this publication there is inconsistency between the graphical representation of the model and the model
description. We believe that the reported model had only three states: stable disease, disease progression
and death.
In our analysis, we adopted the three-state model structure shown in Figure 11.
The model health states are defined as follows:
l pre progression
l post progression
l death.
The PenTAG cost-effectiveness model, implemented in Microsoft Excel® 2013 (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA, USA), simulates a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients with progressed unresectable or
metastatic NETs. At the beginning of the simulation, all patients start in the pre-progression state; they
then transition to the post-progression and death states according to PFS and OS estimates. At the end of
each cycle, they can either remain in their current health state (which is denoted by bent arrows) or move
to other states (which is depicted by straight arrows). Death is the absorbing state in this model. Health
state membership is defined using the partitioned survival approach, which estimates the mean time
spent in each health state from the area under the relevant survival curve. Therefore, the transitions in
Figure 11 are not modelled explicitly. Costs and utilities are estimated for each health state and model
cycle and aggregated over the modelled time horizon to estimate the total per-patient costs and QALYs
for each treatment. The economic outcome in the model is the ICER. A model half-cycle correction has
been applied.
The structure of the PenTAG model, informed by a cost-effectiveness systematic review and the opinions
of our clinical experts, is very similar to the structures of the models submitted by the companies (see
Table 19 for a detailed description of the submitted models).
In the model we assumed that:
l patients receive active treatment until disease progression or earlier treatment discontinuation because
of the onset of serious AEs or other reasons as observed in the RCT sources of effectiveness data
l on progression of disease, patients are treated with BSC.

See Interventions and comparators for further details of the treatments and comparators considered in
our analysis.
Population
In line with the NICE scope, we considered people with progressed unresectable or metastatic NETs from
three different patient populations according to tumour location:
1. patients with NETs of pancreatic origin
2. patients with GI and lung NETs
3. patients with GI (midgut) NETs.
The choice of these particular patient populations was determined by the available clinical effectiveness
RCT data. Specifically, GI (midgut) NETs were assessed as the population recruited to the single RCT for
177Lu-DOTATATE (NETTER-1)102 included only patients with midgut NETs. We did not consider any other
subgroups in our analysis as no relevant clinical evidence was identified during the clinical effectiveness
systematic review (see Chapter 4, Outcomes for randomised controlled trial evidence for pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumours, Subgroup analysis, and Outcomes for randomised controlled trial evidence for
gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours, Subgroup analysis, for further details).
Interventions and comparators
Clinical data identified during the systematic literature review allowed the analyses shown in Table 17 to
be carried out. The treatments included in the model were:
l everolimus
l sunitinib
l 177Lu-DOTATATE (in scenario analyses only)
l BSC.
All included treatments are in the NICE scope.

All treatments included in the model are used in NHS clinical practice in England and Wales. Chemotherapy
and interferon alpha were both considered as comparators in the NICE scope. However, no evidence on the
clinical effectiveness of chemotherapies listed in the scope was identified during the clinical effectiveness
systematic literature review (see Chapter 4, Results). Therefore, chemotherapy was not included in our
analysis. Following the advice from our clinical experts, the AG did not consider interferon alpha in the
economic analysis as it is not commonly used in UK clinical practice.
Perspective, time horizon and discounting
The model perspective was that of the NHS and PSS, in accordance with the NICE reference case.37 In the
base-case analysis, the model time horizon was 40 years, which reflects the lifetime horizon of patients
with advanced NETs. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. The model used a 4-weekly
cycle length to facilitate the implementation of the costs of drug acquisition and administration for
177Lu-DOTATATE as these costs were incurred every 4 weeks.
A number of scenario analyses were performed to estimate the effect on outcomes of different survival
model structures and data and assumptions around the discount rate and model time horizon (see
Appendix 11, Scenario analyses, for further details).
Model parameters
Population characteristics
Mean age
We assumed that all patients were aged 60 years at the start of treatment. The estimate of the mean age
of patients in the model population was based on the patient characteristics from the clinical trials used
in our analysis. In the model, this affects only age-related utilities and background mortality. Mean age
estimates from the companies’ models varied from 61.7 to 63.7 years.
Sex composition
All analyses were performed assuming that the proportion of male patients is 53% (as in RADIANT-334),
which affects only background mortality (see Appendix 11, Table 98). The models in the company
submissions used proportions of 50–51%.
Background mortality
In the base case, we did not incorporate background mortality in all analyses; we accounted for this in
scenario analyses related to 177Lu-DOTATATE. This was because the PFS and OS curves on which the
partitioned survival in the model was based were expected to account for background mortality. However,
background mortality rises as the modelled cohort ages and, as in some analyses OS data were immature,
in those cases the effect of background mortality was taken into account using data for the years 2012–14
from the Office for National Statistics.125
Models submitted by AAA for GEP NETs allow estimation of the ICER with and without general mortality.
When general mortality was taken into account, it was modelled in the subpopulation of patients with
stable disease; in the subpopulation of patients whose disease has progressed, background mortality was
not modelled. Therefore, death events are double-counted during the stable disease stage and may be
underestimated in the progressive disease subpopulation.
In contrast, none of the model-based analyses submitted by Novartis, which considered pancreatic and
GI/lung locations, separately modelled background mortality.

Treatment effectiveness and extrapolation
Baseline randomised controlled trials
RADIANT-334 was chosen as the baseline trial for the pNETs population, whereas RADIANT-435 was chosen
as the baseline trial for the GI (midgut) NETs and GI/lung NETs analyses. The size of the study populations
in these trials was larger and the data were more mature than in A618111181 and NETTER-1.102 In
addition, the control arm in NETTER-1102 received 60 mg of octreotide daily plus BSC, which is outside the
NICE scope for this review.
Modelled progression-free survival and overall survival
A partitioned survival approach was used to populate the parameters of the semi-Markov model. PFS
Kaplan–Meier curves for the trial arms of the main RCTs informing the company submissions on pNETs
(including A6181111 and RADIANT-3), GI/lung NETs (RADIANT-4) and GI (midgut) NETs (RADIANT-4
midgut subgroup and NETTER-1) were extracted from graphs in the latest available source for each trial
[peer-reviewed publications for A6181111,81 RADIANT-334 and RADIANT-4;35 a published conference
abstract for the RADIANT-4 midgut subgroup;74 and an industry submission (NETTER-1)] using digitising
software (DigitizeIt version 2.2.2; Braunschweig, Germany). The extracted data were used to recreate
the associated original individual patient data using the Guyot algorithm126 implemented in R
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
A range of parametric curves from the proportional hazards (Weibull, exponential and Gompertz),
piecewise proportional hazards (restricted cubic splines with five pieces or knots) and accelerated failure
time (AFT) (log-normal, log-logistic and generalised gamma) families were fit to the recreated individual
patient data for each arm separately and evaluated for use in the base-case analysis according to goodness
of fit criteria [Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC)], visual fit to the
empirical data (i.e. the instantaneous probability of event occurrence and Kaplan–Meier curve), plausibility
of long-term extrapolation and consistency between PFS and OS (i.e. no crossing of PFS and OS curves of
the same trial arm). We also consulted our clinical experts for their opinion about the plausibility of the
long-term extrapolations associated with candidate functions. Finally, for our base-case analysis, we adopted
the recommended practice that the same parametric function be used to extrapolate trial data for all arms
in a comparison, to avoid introducing subjective assumptions in the long-term effectiveness estimates.127
We relaxed this restriction in scenario analyses. The following is a summary of the main results of the two
time-to-event outcomes in each of the three locations analysed.
In the RCT sources of effectiveness data for the pNETs model, treatment switching from the placebo arm
to the active treatment arm was observed after disease progression (89% in RADIANT-334 and 65% in
A618111181). Therefore, the following analyses for pNETs are based on Kaplan–Meier OS curves adjusted
for crossover, using the RPSFT method (Robins and Tsiatis128). This approach affects only the placebo arm
of each trial and produces a counterfactual placebo Kaplan–Meier curve, that is, the curve that would have
occurred had no patient switched to the active arm.
In contrast, the analysis of GI or lung NETs is based on RADIANT-4,35 in which 6% of placebo patients
switched to the active arm after disease progression. As no RADIANT-4 OS data were identified in which
treatment switching in the placebo arm was adjusted for, the following analyses are based on the most recent
ITT OS curves reported for RADIANT-435 (cut-off date 20 November 2015). As for the PFS Kaplan–Meier curves
used in our analysis, switching to new active antineoplastic therapy before disease progression occurred in
(confidential information has been removed) of patients in the everolimus arm and (confidential information
has been removed) in the placebo arm (central radiological review), and these cases were censored from the
analysis at the time of switch [RADIANT-435 final clinical study report (CSR), p. 71].
The statistical analysis used to select parametric survival functions for modelling PFS and OS outcomes and
to extrapolate beyond the trial follow-up periods is presented next.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
In general, accelerated failure time models had a better fit than other models to the observed PFS data
from the RADIANT-334 treatment arms, but their advantage was not significant (i.e. BIC difference of < 5
points between the Weibull and the log-logistic functions) in the everolimus arm (Table 18). The fact that
the best model for the placebo arm of RADIANT-334 was the restricted cubic spline function (with six
segments) suggests that the other models may not be valid representations of the trial data for that arm.
The exponential function was the model with the best (i.e. lowest) goodness of fit statistic for sunitinib in
A618111181 (see Table 18), although no significant differences were found between models. On the basis
of this and the available evidence discussed in the following section, and for consistency across arms, in
the base-case analysis the model adopted the Weibull function for the everolimus plus BSC and BSC-only
arms and the exponential function (i.e. Weibull with the shape parameter set to the value of 1) for the
sunitinib plus BSC arm.
In contrast, proportional hazard models had a better fit to the OS data, with the exception of OS in the
placebo arm of RADIANT-3,34 which was best represented by the log-normal function according to the BIC
statistic (see Table 18). The model adopted the Weibull function for the everolimus plus BSC arm and
exponential functions for the sunitinib plus BSC and BSC-only arms in the base-case analysis.

Progression-free survival
Our base-case analysis adopted the Weibull function for PFS outcomes for the everolimus plus BSC and
BSC-only arms and the exponential function for the sunitinib plus BSC arm. In scenario analyses we
adopted the log-logistic, exponential and log-normal functions for the everolimus plus BSC, sunitinib plus
BSC and BSC-only arms respectively.
Everolimus plus best supportive care
The log-logistic model has the most favourable goodness-of-fit results (i.e. lowest value of information
criteria) for the data from the everolimus arm of RADIANT-3,34 although its advantage over the log-normal
and Weibull models is not statistically significant (see Appendix 12, Figure 38). The log-logistic model also
follows the shape of the instantaneous risk (hazard) of progression or death (see Appendix 12, Figure 38).
The log-logistic and log-normal models perform similarly to each other in fitting the Kaplan–Meier PFS
curve, with the Weibull model fitting the data almost as well as the log-logistic and log-normal models.
However, by the end of the observed follow-up period, the risk of progression or death with the Weibull
model is increasing, whereas the risk of progression or death with the log-normal and log-logistic models
is declining (see Appendix 12, Figure 38).
By the end of the observation period, almost 2 years after randomisation, 20% of patients in the everolimus
arm are alive and their disease has not progressed (Figure 12). Thus, adopting the log-logistic or log-normal
model has noticeable implications for the long-term modelling of life free of disease progression. By the
end of a 10-year follow-up, 3.5% of patients would be alive and progression free with the log-logistic or
log-normal (not shown) model, whereas according to the Weibull model all patients would have progressed
or died by 6 years after randomisation (Figure 13).
Best supportive care alone
The BSC-only arm was modelled from data from the placebo arm in RADIANT-3.34 The information criteria
favour the log-normal, log-logistic and generalised gamma models over the rest (see Table 21). The AIC
and BIC statistics, however, do not discriminate between the favoured models (their magnitudes differ by
< 5 points).
The hazard function is non-constant and non-monotonic, which suggests that the Weibull and exponential
models are inappropriate models for these data (see Appendix 12, Figure 39). The information criteria
statistics are consistent with this observation and suggest that the log-normal or gamma model fit the
data best.

Consistent with the model diagnostics of Table 21, the generalised gamma model is a closer match to the
hazard function (see Appendix 12, Figure 39). The log-normal model approximates the smoothed hazard in
Figure 39 (see Appendix 12), except for the drop between week 20 and week 40.
As illustrated in Figure 14, the Weibull model underestimates PFS early on, overestimates it in the medium
term and underestimates it in the final part of the analytical horizon. The log-normal and generalised
gamma models differ only in the final part; the log-normal model appears to fit better the final part of the
Kaplan–Meier curve. Nevertheless, the choice of curve has little impact on mean PFS in this case.
Sunitinib plus best supportive care
As presented in Figure 15, for the PFS data from the sunitinib arm of A6181111,81 the generalised gamma
function provides the best diagnostic results, although the differences between the generalised gamma
model and the exponential and log-normal models are not significant.
As depicted in Figure 40 (see Appendix 12), the generalised gamma model consistently underestimates the
risk of progression, whereas the exponential model, with its constant risk, fits the pattern of risk up to
approximately week 30 and underestimates it thereafter. The log-logistic model seems to follow the shape
of the hazard function for longer periods than the other models.

The implications of adopting one of these curves to extrapolate outcomes for cost-effectiveness analysis is
illustrated in Figure 16. The generalised gamma model’s parametric flexibility appears to produce an overly
optimistic forecast of approximately 35% of patients still alive and not experiencing disease progression
after 10 years. The exponential model, in contrast, predicts that by 5 years 95% of people have
experienced progression or died. The predictions of the log-logistic model fall in between the predictions
of the generalised gamma model and the exponential model, but much closer to the exponential forecast
than the generalised gamma forecast.
The apparent contradiction between the diagnostic results, which suggest that the generalised gamma
function fits the data best, and the hazard and survival function fits, which suggest that the log-logistic
form is superior, appears to be determined by the ability of the gamma form to fit the data better in the
early follow-up period, when more observations are available (e.g. number at risk: 85 at baseline vs. 39 at
22 weeks). Its poor ability to match the risk (hazard) profile and the latter part of the survival curve suggests,
however, that it overfitted the data. The exponential curve was thus selected for the base-case analysis.
Adjustment for indirect comparisons
To derive estimates of PFS time for the sunitinib arm that were comparable to the PFS estimates in

the non-parametric Kaplan–Meier curve of the placebo arm in A618111181 to the area under the
non-parametric Kaplan–Meier curve of the placebo arm in RADIANT-334 at the shortest of the maximum
follow-up times across the two placebo arms. This method was preferred to the common alternative
approach of using the extrapolated means, which by definition are affected by the choice of parametric
function as opposed to being determined solely by the observed data, as in our ‘restricted means’
approach. Thus, in the base case, in which the sunitinib PFS parametric distribution was the exponential,
the sunitinib PFS parametric distribution function was adjusted according to the equation:

wherebλs is the adjusted hazard function of the exponential time-to-disease progression or death distribution,

and the AUC tminfT Ap,T Rp  
Ap and AUC tminfT Ap,T Rp  
Rp functions are the area under the Kaplan–Meier curve of the
placebo arms of A618111181 and RADIANT-3,34 respectively, evaluated at the shortest of the maximum
observation times in the placebo arms of the two trials (i.e. 65 weeks). This is illustrated in Figure 17, where
the vertical discontinuous line denotes the 65th-week time point. At this point, the mean PFS in the placebo
arm is 25.69 weeks in A618111181 and 28.85 weeks in RADIANT-3.34 Thus, the PFS distribution of the
sunitinib arm in the base case is (t) = exp(−^λt) = exp(−0:01197 * t). The same approach was used for OS.
Individual patient data provided by Pfizer to the AG for this assessment allowed us to investigate the
robustness of indirect comparisons of PFS outcomes between the sunitinib arm in A618111181 and the
everolimus and placebo arms in RADIANT-3.34 We conducted a MAIC following the methods described in
a previous study by Signorovitch et al.129 We obtained similar results (which are academic-in-confidence) to
those reported here.
Overall survival
Using similar criteria to those described for the analysis of PFS, the diagnostics information in Table 18 and
visual fit in Figures 41–43 (see Appendix 12), and extrapolated survival rates in Figures 18–20, resulted in
the exponential model being chosen for the everolimus arm, the exponential for the sunitinib and the
exponential for the BSC-only arm of RADIANT-3.34 The resulting equation for sunitinib was then matched
to the RADIANT-334 arms using the same scaling method as described for the PFS time-to-event analysis.
For scenario analyses, the OS function for the BSC-only arm was changed to the log-normal function while
keeping the exponential function for the active treatment arms. Proportion alive without disease progression

Everolimus plus best supportive care
As illustrated in Figure 18, according to the exponential function, by 15 years (180 months) 4% of patients
initially treated with everolimus remain alive, whereas according to the log-normal survival curve, 10% of
patients would be alive at that time point. In its submission, Novartis33 cites an estimated 15-year survival
rate of 6% for patients with advanced pNETs from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program (SEER) database, and considers as plausible extrapolating only those curves predicting survival
rates above that level. However, there is the caveat that:
the RADIANT-3 trial only included patients with well- or moderately-differentiated tumours with radiologic
progression within the 12 months prior to entry in the study. (Confidential information has been removed.)
In contrast, patients in the SEER registry are followed from diagnosis, and are therefore likely to be
treatment-naïve. Also SEER includes all advanced patients regardless of tumour grade and SEER data were
derived over a relatively long period beginning in 1973 whereas follow-up in RADIANT-3 began in 2009.
Novartis submission, p. 9333
[In English life tables, the 15-year survival rate in the general population aged 60 years increased from
56% in males and 74% in females in 1980–2, to 75% and 83%, respectively, in 2006–8 (Office
for National Statistics130)]. The company states that the net impact of these differences in patient
characteristics is unknown. It concludes that ‘it is reasonable to assume that survival in the everolimus
arm of the RADIANT-334 trial would not be substantially less than that for patients with advanced pNETs in
the SEER registry’ (Novartis submission, p. 9333).
Best supportive care alone
The log-normal function had the best fit to the data of the placebo plus BSC arm in RADIANT-3.34 The
generalised gamma function had a good visual fit to the risk of death observed in the trial period (see
Appendix 12, Figure 42) but an overly optimistic 20-year OS rate of 20% (Figure 19). The exponential
function underestimated the hazard risk throughout the trial period (see Appendix 12, Figure 42), but had
a 20-year PFS in the middle of those depicted in Figure 19.
Sunitinib plus best supportive care
The log-normal and exponential functions had the best fit to the OS data for the sunitinib arm in
A618111188 (Table 21), although the log-normal function tracked the risk of death (hazard) observed in the
trial better than the exponential function (see Appendix 12, Figure 43). The projected 15-year survival rate
with the log-normal function is > 10%, whereas with the exponential function it is 4.7% (see Figure 20).
However, the 15-year OS rate used in the model was higher than that seen with the exponential function
as, after adjusting the exponential function for the difference in the placebo arms of the A618111181 and
RADIANT-334 trials (see the following section), the OS rate was 9.7%. Proportion alive

Adjustment for indirect comparison
As before, to derive comparable OS estimates for the treatments in RADIANT-3,34 the OS exponential curve
for sunitinib was adjusted to reflect the difference in RPSFT-adjusted OS between the placebo arm of
A618111181 and the placebo arm of RADIANT-3.34 Figure 21 illustrates the difference, and the vertical
discontinuous line marks the point at which the area under the curve calculation was restricted for both
arms (24 months).
Gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
In gastrointestinal and lung NETs, the model diagnostics suggested that the log-normal model had the best
fit to the PFS data in the everolimus arm of RADIANT-4,35 whereas the two-parameter models were inferior
to the three-parameter gamma or six-parameter spline model were the best fit to the PFS data in the
placebo arm of RADIANT-435 (Table 19). In contrast, the exponential, Gompertz and Weibull models fitted
the OS data as well as or better than other models.
Progression-free survival
In the base-case analysis, the Weibull function was chosen for the everolimus plus BSC arm and the
BSC-only arm based on data from RADIANT-4.35 In scenario analyses, the generalised gamma function was
used instead for both model arms. See Appendix 13 for details.

Overall survival
The base-case analysis adopted exponential distributions separately fitted to OS data in the everolimus arm
and the placebo arm of RADIANT-4.35 The Gompertz and Weibull distributions had the best goodness of fit
statistics and seemed to provide the best fit to the everolimus hazard rates (see Appendix 12, Figure 46)
and Kaplan–Meier curves (Figure 22), whereas the exponential function seemed to be the best fit to the
placebo data (see Figures 23 and 47). However, only the extrapolations of the exponential and log-logistic
distributions seemed plausible, as discussed in the following two sections. In scenario analyses, log-logistic
distributions separately estimated for the two trial arms were adopted.
Everolimus plus best supportive care
To reflect the uncertainty resulting from immature data, Figure 22 presents the OS extrapolations for
all available parametric curves. The exponential function appears to overestimate the risk of death
(see Appendix 12, Figure 46) and underestimate the Kaplan–Meier OS curve (see Figure 22) in the early
part of the trial observation period35 (data cut-off 30 November 2015), although the discrepancy is within
the sampling error (95% CI, not presented). The exponential curve crosses the log-logistic curve twice,
once during the interpolation (within-trial) period and once in the late extrapolation (beyond-trial) period.
In its submission to NICE, Novartis33 turns to external data to inform its choice of survival curves. In
particular, it states that:
Analysis of distant NET cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2012 in the SEER database (a large
population-based registry in the USA) suggests that survival for patients with distant disease at
diagnosis at 15 years is approximately 10% (Data unpublished). Although it is difficult to make
comparisons between the RADIANT-4 trial population and the available SEER data (see Appendix 9 of
Novartis submission for further details), it is reasonable to assume that survival in the placebo plus BSC
arm of the RADIANT-4 trial is likely to be no less than that of patients with distant disease in the SEER
database given improvements in survival over time in patients with NET.
Novartis submission (p. 137)33
In appendix 9 of the Novartis submission, Novartis33 reports the data and methods used to obtain its 10%
survival benchmark at 15 years; Kaplan–Meier survival curves by location from SEER were weighted
according to the distribution of patients by location in RADIANT-4.35 Novartis also acknowledges the
limitations of these SEER data, as discussed earlier for pNETs. Proportion alive

High degrees of uncertainty are similarly present in the later parts of the follow-up period for patients in
the placebo arm of RADIANT-4,35 as evidenced by the large steps observed after approximately 2 years of
follow-up (Figure 20).
Gastrointestinal (midgut) neuroendocrine tumours
The base-case analysis of the GI (midgut) location was populated with data from the head-to-head
comparison of everolimus plus BSC and placebo plus BSC in RADIANT-435 for the GI (midgut) population
subgroup73 (Table 20).
Progression-free survival
In the base-case analysis the exponential distribution was adopted to model PFS outcomes in the
everolimus arm and the placebo arm of RADIANT-4.73 PFS in the 177Lu-DOTATATE arm of NETTER-1102
was also modelled with an exponential distribution (see Appendix 11 for scenario analyses).
Everolimus plus best supportive care
The exponential function, which was the function with the best statistical fit (Figure 24), appeared to
have a poor fit to the hazard rates for everolimus in RADIANT-473 (see Appendix 12, Figure 48). However,
this is caused by the small sample available in the latter part of the RADIANT-473 follow-up period. Of the
candidate functions, the log-normal function has the longest PFS duration, followed by the exponential
and the Weibull functions (see Figure 24).
Best supportive care alone
The diagnostic statistics (see Table 20) did not discriminate between the [accelerated failure time (AFT)
or proportional hazards] models available to represent the PFS data in the placebo arm of RADIANT-4,73
although the generalised gamma and log-normal functions displayed PFS hazard rates that were similar to
those observed during the trial (see Appendix 12, Figure 49). When turning to the extrapolation of PFS,
the generalised gamma function seems to result in overly optimistic disease PFS rates (see Figure 25).
In scenario analyses, the log-normal distribution was used instead of the exponential to model the PFS
experience of patients in the placebo arm.
Overall survival
In the absence of data, the base-case analysis currently assumes that the OS curve for everolimus in the GI
(midgut)-only location is the exponential OS curve estimated in the GI or lung patient population in the
everolimus arm of RADIANT-4,35 discussed earlier, adjusted by the proportional difference in mean PFS in
the everolimus arm of RADIANT-435 between the overall GI/lung patient population and the subgroup of
GI (midgut) patients. Likewise, the OS curve for the BSC-only arm of RADIANT-435 in the GI (midgut)-only Proportion alive

population is derived from adjusting the exponential function fitted to the OS data from the everolimus
arm of RADIANT-435 in the GI/lung population considered above by the proportional difference in mean
PFS between the overall GI/lung and the GI (midgut) patient groups. These derivations follow the same
steps as in Equation 1. We requested OS data for the GI (midgut)-only location from Novartis, but the
company did not provide them to us.
Adverse events
The probabilities of AEs were used to estimate costs in the stable disease state. For the economic evaluation
of treatments for pNETs, probabilities of AEs were derived from rates estimated from our indirect comparison
of treatment-related grade 3/4 AEs of ≥ 2% incidence in any active treatment arm (see Chapter 4, Indirect
treatment comparison: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours; Appendix 21, Table 136 and Appendix 9). We
updated these analyses with data provided in the Pfizer submission to NICE.32 For the GI/lung analysis, the AG
model adopted the probabilities in the Novartis model submitted to NICE,33 as these were calculated with
individual patient data not available to the AG. For everolimus plus BSC and BSC only in the GI (midgut)
evaluation, we adopted the grade 3/4 AE rates for the everolimus and placebo arms reported in a recent
conference poster by RADIANT-4 investigators;73 for 177Lu-DOTATATE we used the grade 3/4 AE rates
reported in the AAA submission to NICE.31
The AE probabilities for the pNETs model were obtained by assuming that patients had no multiple
instances of the same AE type and that AEs lasted for only one cycle. This seems a reasonable assumption
in the light of the evidence in the CSR for A6181111,81 which reports the actual duration of the grade 3/4
AEs recorded in the trial (tables 5, 24, 26 and 29 in the full CSR of A61811181). For GI/lung and GI
(midgut) NETs the same assumption was adopted.
Based on calculations by the AG the measured differences in grade 3/4 AEs between everolimus and
sunitinib in patients with pNETs considered by Novartis in its submission,33 and for which disutility values are
available (see Utility values for the Peninsula Technology Assessment Group model for details), are associated
with negligible differences in utility, equal to a 0.002 quality-adjusted months, and were therefore not used
in calculating utility values for stable disease in the pNETs model. For GI/lung and GI (midgut) analyses, the
available utility values, which were derived from patient-reported outcomes in RADIANT-435 and evidence
from the ERASMUS study31 submitted to NICE by AAA, were assumed to capture the impact of AEs.
Modelling post progression
Based on data from RADIANT-334 for pNETs and RADIANT-435 for GI and lung NETs, which we assumed
applied to GI (midgut) NETs, in the base-case analysis we assumed that all patients have BSC after
progression on initial treatment. This consists of palliative care and 30 mg of octreotide for symptomatic
treatment, with no active drug treatment. Proportion alive and progression free

Subsequent treatments were allowed in the post-progression phase and were applied as a fixed cost in the
first cycle after disease progression. The frequency of subsequent treatment use was assumed to be zero in
the base-case analysis; scenario analyses considered applying the same costs of subsequent treatments as
in the pNETs and GI and lung models from Novartis.33 This choice of base case reflected the fact that (1) the
A618111181 trial of sunitinib did not collect information on subsequent treatments, which led Novartis to
apply the same costs of subsequent treatments to both arms, and (2) the way that Novartis implemented
subsequent treatment costs in its models is unreliable (see Chapter 5, Critical appraisal of the company
submissions). In the GI and lung and GI (midgut)-only analyses, we adopted the same costs and
implementation of subsequent treatments as in the GI and lung model of Novartis, which used detailed
information on differences between trial arms in the frequency of treatment use post progression in
RADIANT-4.35 As we had no information for 177Lu-DOTATATE, we assumed that it had the same
subsequent treatment costs as applied to everolimus.
The costs of disease monitoring in our model were obtained from the pNETs and GI and lung models from
Novartis.33 Based on the opinion of our clinical experts, we adopted a smaller number of visits for the GI
and lung evaluation than were used by Novartis in its model of the same location (see Costs of medical
management and disease monitoring).
Systematic review of utilities
The methods used to identify utility parameter values for the model are reported in Appendix 15.
Utility values for the Peninsula Technology Assessment Group model
Of the eight independent sources of data identified through the systematic search of utility studies, only a
limited proportion of evidence was suitable to populate the PenTAG cost-effectiveness model. This was
mainly because of the differences in the treatments being evaluated and the discrepancies between the
definitions of HRQoL outcome measures in the studies and the model’s health states.
The utility values used in the PenTAG cost-effectiveness model and their sources are presented by tumour
location, in accordance with the NICE scope. No utility values for HRQoL outcomes measured in pNET patients
under treatment with everolimus were found (Table 21). The only available estimates for everolimus in pNETs
were those reported by the preference elicitation study of Swinburn et al.,
131 who asked approximately 100
members of the general public to assess descriptors (vignettes) of pre-progression and post-progression health
states of patients with GI NETs and pNETs, using the time trade-off method. This study also elicited utility
decrements resulting from the occurrence of some of the most common AEs associated with treatment
therapies (see Appendix 10, Pancreatic studies, for details; AEs considered include neutropenia, hypertension,
palmar–plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, leukopenia, diarrhoea, stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, anaemia,
hyperglycaemia, fatigue, infections, pneumonitis and nausea). In the base-case analysis submitted to NICE,
Novartis33 used the utility value reported by this source for the pre-progression health state, adjusted for the
disutility associated with the incidence of the common types of grade 3 or 4 AEs in RADIANT-3.34 As these
values do not meet the NICE reference case37 we considered them only in scenario analyses.
In the absence of HRQoL outcomes measured in pNET patients treated with everolimus, the base-case value
was assumed to be the same as for sunitinib (see Table 21 and its description). This assumption was adopted
after calculating the net difference in disutility from grade 3/4 AEs between everolimus and sunitinib
according to the disutility values reported by Swinburn et al.,
131 which was equal to 0.002 quality-adjusted
months. Giving the uncertainty associated with other parameters in the model, including the limited quality
of AE data available for economic evaluation purposes, we considered such a difference insignificant.
Estimates of the utility of pNET patients undergoing treatment with sunitinib in both the pre-progression
and the post-progression health states (see Table 21) were obtained by mapping individual patient data
onto responses to the EORTC QLQ-C30 from A618111181 provided by the manufacturer (Pfizer, data
request through NICE) using the algorithm of McKenzie and van der Pol.132 Using these data the utility
values that the company used in the model-based cost-effectiveness evidence submitted to NICE were

validated. Although the methods used by the company were not properly described in the submission
itself,32 the values used and the methods had been reported in the study by Mucino Ortega et al.121
The validation exercise therefore sought to replicate the utility values submitted to NICE by following the
methods described by Mucino Ortega et al.121 This consisted of fitting a linear mixed-model equation to
the EORTC QLQ-C30 data mapped to the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) using the algorithm developed
by McKenzie and van der Pol132 to estimate the effect of random group allocation (sunitinib vs. placebo)
on EQ-5D utilities, adjusting for baseline EQ-5D score and treatment cycle (information available from the
authors). Confidential information has been removed. Nonetheless, the estimate obtained employing the
model is an approximation, as the estimate of utility in progressive disease was based only on data for
the end-of-treatment follow-up time point relating to the placebo arm. This approximation relies on the
fact that > 90% of patients in the placebo arm had progressed by the end of the study.
Confidential information has been removed. This difference is the result of the incorrect use of the data in
the analysis conducted by the manufacturer of sunitinib (Pfizer) in its submission to the Scottish Medicines
Consortium (SMC)133 and used by Novartis in its sensitivity analysis of the economic evaluation submitted
to NICE.33 The company incorrectly used baseline utility as the utility for the pre-progression health state,
thus omitting the effects of treatment on patients’ utility during stable disease. In contrast, our replication
of the utility values in Mucino Ortega et al.’s121 study led us to the following estimated linear mixed-model
equation for stable disease:
EQ5Dmit = 0:089−0:019 sunitinib armi + 0:822 * EQ5Dm baselinei −0:0048 * cycleit −0:0016
* cycle * sunitinib armit. (2)

where EQ-5Dm is the mapped utility score from the EORTC QOLQ-C30 in A6181111,81 using the
algorithm from McKenzie and van der Pol.132 To estimate utilities for the two trial arms in the stable
disease state, this model was fitted to data excluding the last follow-up, that is, the end-of-treatment
follow-up observations, when some patients may have experienced disease progression, resulting in their
withdrawal from treatment.
For GI and lung NETs patients under treatment with everolimus (Table 22), we used unpublished
treatment-specific utility values, which were presented by Novartis as part of the evidence submitted
to NICE and used by the company in sensitivity analyses of its economic evaluation. These data were
preferred to published estimates from pooled analysis74 (i.e. utilities by health state regardless of treatment
arm) used by the company in its base-case economic model submission, as they incorporate the impact of
treatment-specific AEs and comorbidities on HRQoL. The treatment-specific utilities in the company’s
submission were based on unpublished individual patient data from RADIANT-435 that were not available
to us for review. To validate such estimates, we mapped mean FACT-G scores in RADIANT-4,35 reported by
Singh et al.74 in a poster also reporting pooled utilities by health state, using a linearised version of the
algorithm from Longworth et al.134 (see Appendix 15). The values that we obtained were approximately
equal to those produced by the company from individual patient data in the pooled analysis with the
original, non-linear mapping algorithm (see Appendix 22).
In the absence of data specific to lung or to GI-only patients for everolimus plus BSC and BSC only,
we assumed the same utility values for these subgroups as for the overall RADIANT-435 population.
No data on HRQoL for patients treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE were identified through the systematic
review. For this reason, we had to rely on unpublished data submitted by AAA.31 The utility values in
the PenTAG base-case model are based on a Dutch single-arm, uncontrolled study that has not been
published at the time of writing. Utility values for pre-progression GI NET patients (see Table 22) were
measured in the ERASMUS study, a single-centre, non-controlled, Phase I/II open-label study, conducted
in 810 Dutch patients with different somatostatin receptor-positive tumour types. These data were used
to estimate the utility of GI NET patients in the pre- and post-progression health states in the base-case
cost-effectiveness model. Empirical data on HRQoL associated with 177Lu-DOTATATE in GI NET patients
obtained from the Guy’s and St Thomas’ (UK) hospital registry were used by the company to estimate
the utility of pre-progression patients. As no justification for this inconsistency in the choice of sources
between the two health states was provided, the evidence from the ERASMUS study was preferred.

The utilities adopted for the de novo model by the AG, presented in Tables 21 and 22, were further adjusted
for the effect of ageing in the model using the following linear equation, which was estimated by the AG
from EQ-5D data in the Health Surgery for England 2012135 following the approach of Ara and Brazier:136
health state (HS) utility in cycle # = HS utility in cycle 0 × (1−0:0018 × cycle # –2×0:00001
× square of cycle #). (3)
This adjustment was applied to all utilities irrespective of health state or treatment arm.
Summary
There is a lack of published evidence on HRQoL, especially for progressive disease in pNETs. In addition, for
one of the comparators evaluated in this location, everolimus, there is no evidence available on the HRQoL
outcomes in actual patients. In contrast, the present review benefited from access to individual patient
data on HRQoL outcomes in patients from one of the main trials in the assessment, A6181111,81 provided
by Pfizer through a NICE request.
The AG was able to validate the utilities derived by Novartis for the progressive disease and stable disease
states in the GI location from RADIANT-435 data, without having access to the individual patient data
but only aggregate HRQoL domain scores, by a linear approximation to the best-fitting algorithm from
Longworth et al.,
134 used by Novartis to map individual FACT-G scores onto the EQ-5D. Linearising the
best-fitting non-linear algorithm using first-order approximations enabled the successful validation of
published mapped utilities.
In the absence of data specific to lung or to GI-only patients for everolimus plus BSC and BSC only, we
assumed the same utility values for these subgroups as for the overall RADIANT-435 population.
The analyses of individual patient data highlighted the importance of requesting such data from the trial
sponsors. This allowed the identification of fundamental errors in the interpretation of the data contained
in the submissions to the three bodies responsible for making resource allocation decisions for England,
Wales and Scotland.
Resources and costs
Cost parameters and assumptions
The unit costs of treatments and resources were sourced according to the NICE Guide to the Methods of
Technology Appraisal 2013.
37 Only costs that relate to the included interventions for the treatment of
NETs, and to resources under the control of the NHS and PSS, were included. Value-added tax was
excluded. Costs that were common and equal in all treatment strategies over the time horizon of the
analysis were excluded. The cost-effectiveness results reflect the present value of costs and benefits
accruing over the time horizon of the analysis.
We modelled the following costs, which were inflated to the cost year 2016, and used an annual discount
rate of 3.5%:
l drug acquisition
l drug administration
l medical management and disease monitoring
l SAE management
l end-of-life care.

Costs of drug acquisition
Comparator treatments Table 23 presents the unit costs of comparator treatments. The unit costs of
everolimus and sunitinib were sourced from the British National Formulary (BNF) in September 2016.36
The cost per unit of 177Lu-DOTATATE was provided by AAA as commercial-in-confidence information.
The base-case analyses used list prices. The results were also run using PAS prices, which can be found in
the confidential appendix. This appendix is not included here as it contained commercial information
provided by a company in confidence, as part of the NICE assessment process.
The recommended dosing for everolimus and sunitinib was sourced from their Summary of Product
Characteristics (10 mg daily and 37.5 mg daily, respectively). The dose and administration schedule for
177Lu-DOTATATE (four administrations at intervals of 8 ± 1 week) was provided by AAA.
The base case used recommended dosing, adjusted for treatment interruptions and dose modifications as
observed during the clinical trials. These RDIs were 85.9%34 and 91.3%81 for everolimus and sunitinib,
respectively, in pNETs and 79.4%35 for everolimus in GI and lung NETs. 177Lu-DOTATATE in GI (midgut)
NETs had a RDI of 86.4%.
Table 24 presents the median unadjusted durations of treatment observed in the trials. We used median
values to create exponential distributions for sunitinib to estimate the proportion of patients with stable
disease remaining on treatment and thereby estimate the average cost of a course of treatment. As a
conservative approach, for everolimus we adopted the mean values used by Novartis33 in its pNETs and
GI/lung economic evaluations. Had we used exponential extrapolations fitted to the median treatment
durations, the mean values for everolimus would have been 12.68 and 13.40 months for pNETs and
GI/lung NETs, respectively, instead of the base case values of 9.41 and 11.54 months respectively. Time
on treatment in the AG model was then assumed to follow an exponential distribution using the mean
values in Table 124.
Table 25 presents the acquisition costs of the comparator treatments per 28-day Markov cycle. These are
calculated by multiplying the unit cost for 28 days of treatment by the RDI.
The unit cost of SSAs, drugs administered as an adjunct to 177Lu-DOTATATE, chemotherapies and
supportive treatments are also presented in the table.

Use of somatostatin analogues in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours The proportions of patients
using SSAs for tumour suppression in stable disease were based on the proportions reported in clinical
trials, adjusted in an ITC conducted by Novartis (section 4.7.2 of the Novartis submission33). The adjusted
rates are presented in Table 26. We assumed that the SSA usage was equally split between octreotide and
lanreotide and that SSA usage following sunitinib would be the same as that for everolimus.
The proportions of patients using SSAs for tumour suppression post progression were based on targeted
treatment utilisation (proportions) following progression in the RADIANT-334 trial (data provided on request
by Novartis). The proportion using targeted treatments following progression after everolimus was 23%;
in the absence of a better source, this was assumed to be a fair estimate of the proportion of patients
using targeted treatments following progression after sunitinib. In the BSC arm of RADIANT-3,34 19.2%
of patients were treated with targeted treatments following progression. In both the active and the BSC
strategies, target treatments were assumed to be 20 mg of 50% octreotide and 90 mg of 50% lanreotide.
Somatostatin analogues were not used in stable disease for symptom control; however, we did include this
resource in progressive disease. The proportion of patients using SSAs for symptom control was the same
across the active treatment and BSC strategies; these were sourced from the unpublished UK utilisation
survey presented in the Novartis submission.33 The average number of SSA administrations at 500 µg was
1.9 per patient per cycle.
Use of somatostatin analogues in gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours and
gastrointestinal (midgut) neuroendocrine tumours The proportions of patients using SSAs for tumour
suppression were based on octreotide utilisation in RADIANT-4.35 The estimates used are unpublished
but are reported in the CSR.138 The estimates used in the model are presented in Table 27. We made the
assumption that SSA utilisation concurrent and following sunitinib treatment would be the same as
observed for everolimus.
Use of drugs as an adjunct to 177Lu-DOTATATE Advice from expert clinicians is that use of antiemetics
and parenteral amino acids should be standard practice in support of treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE.
Similar to the approach adopted by AAA, we assumed that every treatment cycle of 177Lu-DOTATATE
(adjusted for RDI) was accompanied by a 5-day course of an antiemetic {2 mg of granisetron [Granisetron
hydrochloride, Alliance Healthcare (Distribution) Ltd]; unit cost £50.38) and an amino acid supplement

unit cost £26.70].
Chemotherapy utilisation post progression For the pNETs evaluation we adopted unpublished
chemotherapy utilisation rates from RADIANT-3,34 provided by Novartis33 and presented in Appendix 15,
Table 111. Slightly different data were also provided in table 3.7 of appendix 3 of the Novartis evidence
submission to NICE on the rate of subsequent treatments in RADIANT-333,34 for patients who progress
following active treatment (29.4%) and BSC (29.1%)]. In the absence of post-progression treatment
information for patients in A618111,81 we assumed the same chemotherapy utilisation rates for people
who progressed following sunitinib as was observed for everolimus.
For the GI and lung NETs evaluation and the GI (midgut) evaluation, we adopted unpublished
chemotherapy utilisation rates from RADIANT-435 (supplied in the Novartis evidence submission33),
presented in Appendix 16, Table 113.
Other supportive drug therapies Other therapies are used to support patients with NETs in addition to
the use of SSAs, including analgesics, antiemetics, and antidiarrhoeals. We included the cost of these
therapies in the GI and lung NETs evaluation and the GI (midgut) NETs evaluation using the unpublished
utilisation rates supplied in the Novartis submission,33 which are based on data from RADIANT-4.35 These
are presented in Table 114 (see Appendix 16). No equivalent utilisation estimates were identified for other
supportive therapies for patients with pNETs and so no costs of this type were included.
Costs of drug administration
There is significant variation across the comparator treatments in the resource requirements for their
administration. Everolimus and sunitinib are ingested orally as a tablet and capsule, respectively, and are
usually self-administered, whereas 177Lu-DOTATATE is administered in the secondary care setting by
intravenous infusion over 20–30 minutes.139,140 The cost of hospital pharmacy dispensing, applied at each
outpatient clinic visit, was included in our costing for the oral preparations. This required 12 minutes of
hospital pharmacist time, equating to £14.40.

In contrast, the administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE is resource intensive. As a radiolabelled and
intravenously delivered drug, it requires specialist oversight and a hospital setting. AAA31 concurs in its data
submission (section 2, p. 25) by stating that its expectation of routine treatment is delivery ‘in a nuclear
medicine department within a secondary care hospital as an outpatient appointment’. However, we are
guided by expert clinical opinion (consultants in nuclear medicine) that current standard practice is to
admit patients overnight. We understand that selected patients at a single specialist centre in England are
managed as day cases and this approach may be expanded in the future.
Table 28 presents the cost of drug administration for 177Lu-DOTATATE. The estimated quantity of
resource required is the average elicited from two NHS consultants in nuclear medicine. Unit costs were
obtained from standard sources.141,142
The costs associated with administering supportive treatments are presented in Table 29. Unit costs were

In the absence of published disease-specific detailed estimates of NHS resourcing, we relied on a source of
unpublished evidence supplied by Novartis to tell us which resources are used and what the expected rates
of utilisation are. In an industry-sponsored survey, nine physicians from seven UK centres were asked in
2016 to confirm the nature of NETs resourcing (type and rate) from a previous resource use survey of
32 clinicians in England in 2011. The validation process was framed in the context of personal practice in
the previous year, across various disease stages and primary tumour locations.
The physicians were asked to list the various types of resource that a patient with NETs requires during the
course of the disease and estimate the number of times that a patient would see each physician each
month. The resource use for the given NETs patient population was then calculated as a weighted average
of the annual number treated by each clinician relative to the total number treated annually across all
clinicians. These estimates were then weighted according to the respective proportions of patients with
pNETs in RADIANT-334 and GI NETs and lung NETs in RADIANT-4,35 to determine resource use for the
overall trial populations.
For the BSC strategy in the pNETs evaluation, which was not modelled by Novartis, the resource utilisation
of patients with stable disease was assumed to be the same as that presented for patients on active
treatment. For patients with pNETs who progressed on BSC, resource utilisation was assumed to be equal
to that for those who progressed on active treatment.
In some instances we modified the raw survey findings for our modelling:
l The frequency of resource use for people who progressed following active treatment was adjusted
downwards according to the proportion of people who resided ‘in observation’ in clinical trials
(32.7% following progression on active treatment, 33.3% following BSC), which was effectively BSC.
l The frequencies of consultations and procedures and tests for people with stable pNETs receiving BSC
were reduced to below the estimates for active treatment. The reductions were proportionate to the
differences observed between active treatment and BSC in GI and lung and GI (midgut) NETs
(approximately 4 : 1 for consultations and 2 : 1 for tests/procedures).
l The frequencies of consultation between people with GI and lung NETs/GI (midgut) NETs and the
medical oncologist were adjusted downwards to the average of estimates from our expert clinicians.
Utilisation survey estimates gathered by Novartis appeared high in absolute terms but also compared
with frequencies in people with pNETs.
We used standard sources for the unit costing of disease management and monitoring.141 These unit costs
are presented in Table 30.
Rates of hospital resource use are presented in Table 31 for the pNETs evaluation and Table 32 for the GI
and lung NETs and GI (midgut) NETs evaluations.
Other supportive procedures following progression Additional supportive procedures were included
in the pNETs evaluation based on patient-level data from RADIANT-334 supplied by Novartis in its
evidence submission.33
Similarly, supportive treatments were included in the costing for the GI and lung NETs and GI (midgut)
NETs evaluations. These rates of utilisation were based on patient-level data from RADIANT-435 supplied by
Novartis in its evidence submission.33
Costs of adverse event management
Adverse events experienced by patients on treatment attract additional health-care resources. To approximate
the cost of managing those treatment-related AEs that could influence the cost-effectiveness of included
treatments, we included only grade 3 and 4 AEs (SAEs) occurring in ≥ 2% of patients in either arm of the
trials (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03111).

In pNETs, an ITC was conducted to match the trial populations of A618111181 and NETTER-1102 to the trial
populations of the respective RADIANT trials (see Table 135). For each active treatment in the three
evaluations, an OR was applied to the weighted average rate to give a relative rate by strategy for each

event type (see Table 115). In GI and lung NETs (see Table 116), and GI (midgut) NETs (see Table 117),
the unadjusted proportions of patients experiencing a SAE as reported in RADIANT-435 and NETTER-1102
were used.
Based on the assumption that no patient would report more than one SAE of any specific type during their
time on treatment, we applied the costs of SAE management only to the initial Markov cycle in the
progression-free health state.
Cost of end-of-life care
On the basis that the average cost of health resource use in the final weeks of the life of a cancer patient
is a reasonable surrogate for patients with a NET, we used an estimate from the literature for cancer
patients in England and Wales (£4346.19). This includes elective and non-elective inpatient admissions,
outpatient appointments, accident and emergency visits and district nurse and general practitioner (GP)
visits from the point at which a strong opioid is first used.143
Checking the model for wiring errors
The economic model was checked in three ways. First, all calculations in the model were performed by one
person and checked by another person. Second, the results of the model were checked by construction of
an independent simplified model. Third, the reasonableness of outputs given extreme input values was
checked. For example, total mean life-years are expected to be equal to total mean QALYs when all
utilities are set to 1.

Cost-effectiveness results
Base-case results
In this section, we report the outputs of our base-case analysis on a per-tumour location basis assuming list
prices for everolimus and sunitinib.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
According to the model predictions, the highest mean survival time is expected in patients with pNETs
treated with sunitinib (6.39 years); an intermediate mean survival time (4.69 years) is predicted in patients
treated with everolimus and the lowest mean survival time is expected in patients treated with BSC
(3.46 years). Similarly, the highest mean QALYs are produced in patients treated with sunitinib followed by
patients treated with everolimus and BSC only. The highest costs are predicted in patients in the sunitinib
arm, followed by patients in the everolimus and BSC-only arms, with the costs of drug acquisition being
the major driver of the total costs.
The resulting mean ICER for everolimus compared with BSC is £45,493 per QALY. As this figure is
higher than the ICER for sunitinib compared with everolimus, sunitinib and BSC extendedly dominate
everolimus, so that, ultimately, the relevant comparison is sunitinib compared with BSC, for which the
ICER is £20,717.
The breakdown of life-year, QALY and cost outcomes is presented in Table 33. It may be noted that,
although sunitinib incurs higher incremental per-patient drug acquisition costs compared with BSC than
everolimus does (£27,431 vs. £26,885), sunitinib more than compensates for the excess in costs through
the larger corresponding incremental gain in QALYs compared with BSC (1.32 years vs. 0.59 years). The
majority of the difference in QALY outcomes originates from survival time in the post-progression health
state (1.89 years vs. 0.52 years), which has the same associated HRQoL under both treatment options.
Gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
The comparison between treatment with everolimus and treatment with BSC for the GI and lung NETs
patient subpopulation yielded an ICER of £44,557 per QALY, exceeding the upper bound of NICE’s
threshold range. Treatment of these patients with everolimus results in better survival (6.21 years vs.
4.82 years for BSC). Likewise, the treatment costs in the everolimus arm are higher, driven by the drug
acquisition costs in the pre- and post-progression health states (Table 34).
Gastrointestinal (midgut) neuroendocrine tumours
In our analysis, treatment of patients from the GI (midgut) NETs subpopulation with everolimus and BSC
results in survival times of 7.5 years and 7.05 years respectively. Predicted QALYs are slightly higher in
patients treated with everolimus than in patients treated with BSC (4.37 vs. 4.12).
A mean cost of £55,842 per patient was incurred in the everolimus arm, whereas the mean cost in the
BSC arm was £21,119 per patient. Drug acquisition was the major cost component in this analysis
(Table 35). The resulting ICER for everolimus compared with BSC was £199,233 per QALY.
In Table 36 we present the results for the treatment of GI (midgut) NETs with 177Lu-DOTATATE. This
analysis incorporates background mortality as explained in Background mortality.
Sensitivity analyses are presented in Appendix 18. Subgroup analyses and scenario analyses are presented
in Appendix 11.
Discussion
In patients with NETs of pancreatic origin, sunitinib plus BSC was estimated to incur a cost per QALY
gained compared with BSC alone of £17,890. Everolimus was found to be an inefficient treatment option

as it achieves QALY gains compared with BSC at a higher average cost than sunitinib (i.e. it is ‘extendedly
dominated’) in this patient population. Therefore, sunitinib is cost-effective in the NHS at the upper NICE
threshold range of £30,000 per QALY.
As discussed in Chapter 7, sunitinib also meets the end-of-life criteria from NICE in the patient population
of A6181111,81 as it extends mean OS in patients with pNETs by > 3 months relative to placebo plus BSC,
for which life expectancy is not significantly different from 24 months at conventional levels of statistical
significance (i.e. p < 0.05).

These results are based on an indirect comparison of two RCTs in different patient populations.
Assessment of the extent of heterogeneity across the trials and relative effectiveness between treatments is
complicated by the fact that there was substantial treatment crossover from the placebo arms to the active
arms in these trials. The companies sponsoring the two treatments have conducted statistical analyses that
seek to adjust for such crossover. The AG asked the companies to provide the codes and data to be able
to replicate their crossover-adjusted analyses of OS and understand whether the methods are likely to be
comparable. The sponsor of everolimus provided such information too close to the end of the reviewing
period to allow the AG to review and incorporate the evidence in this report. The sponsor of sunitinib
provided the trial data but not the code to replicate the results of its crossover-adjusted analysis of OS.
This leaves a crucial source of uncertainty unaddressed, as the available crossover-adjusted OS curves from
published reports, which we used to inform our base-case analysis, suggest that life expectancy in the
placebo arm of the everolimus trial (RADIANT-334) is 30% higher than life expectancy in the placebo arm
of the sunitinib trial (A6181111;81 18 vs. 14 months).

Our analyses extend the evaluation of pNETs submitted by the companies to include the BSC-only arm,
in line with the NICE scope for this assessment. There is no clear justification for excluding this treatment
option from the analysis, especially as the RCTs in this patient population have themselves included this
treatment option as the control arm. More importantly, advice from our clinical experts suggests that, in
advanced, unresectable or metastatic patients with progressive disease who are asymptomatic, giving no
active initial treatment is a treatment option in practice.
In the GI or lung NETs patient population, the available head-to-head trial evidence from the Phase III
RADIANT-435 trial suggests that everolimus is not cost-effective at the upper NICE threshold of £30,000 per
QALY, even after adjusting for the negotiated PAS discount. Contrary to the analysis submitted to NICE by
the company sponsoring everolimus, we adopted different utility values in stable disease to acknowledge
the effect of treatment on patient HRQoL. Whereas the company found that everolimus is (confidential
information has been removed) after applying the PAS discount, we found that the ICER was £39,323
per QALY. Our analysis reveals that the company’s results were not robust to limited variations in the

We have also extended the economic evaluation of everolimus to the GI (midgut) population based
on subgroup analyses of PFS published by the company and found everolimus to have an ICER of
£135,000 per QALY gained compared with BSC. This analysis is subject to high levels of uncertainty
because of the lack of OS data specific to this patient subgroup, which was addressed by assuming that
the OS treatment effect of everolimus was proportional to its PFS treatment effect in this population.
Moreover, in RADIANT-4,35 the source of the effectiveness data for this analysis, randomisation was not
stratified according to the midgut location and thus the resulting PFS evidence in the midgut subgroup is
subject to a lower level of internal validity.
We conducted scenario analyses for the GI (midgut) location in which evidence from the NETTER-1102 trial
for the 177Lu-DOTATATE arm was matched to the midgut population of RADIANT-435 by assuming that
the control arm in NETTER-1102 represents the same treatment as that given in the placebo plus BSC arm in
RADIANT-4.35 As this assumption has been questioned by our clinical experts, we consider this analysis
with reservation. Subject to these caveats, 177Lu-DOTATATE is associated with higher QALY benefits
compared with BSC than everolimus compared with BSC, and achieves those benefits at a lower cost per
QALY than everolimus (i.e. it extendedly dominates it), but its ICER of £74,000 relative to BSC is well
above the NICE threshold.

Chapter 7 End of life
For each of the NET locations considered in our analyses, we estimated life expectancy as the area under
the OS Kaplan–Meier curve of the placebo plus BSC arm, which was used as the source of data in the
AG model. For pNETs the curve used in these analyses was the placebo Kaplan–Meier curve adjusted using
the RPSFT method,48,69,122 whereas for GI/lung only, for which only unadjusted Kaplan–Meier data were
available (crossover in the placebo arm was 6%35,88), the ITT placebo Kaplan–Meier curve was used. The
results are presented in Table 37.
Mean survival estimates from head-to-head trials show that the null hypothesis that the pNETs population
in A618111181 meets the life expectancy end-of-life criterion is not rejected by the data as the 95% CI
of the extrapolated (to a maximum age of 100 years) mean survival in the placebo arm (95% CI 16 to
27 months) crosses the 24-month threshold. In other words, the data support the view that life expectancy
with BSC only in A618111181 may be ≤ 2 years. In contrast, the pNETs population in RADIANT-334 has
an extrapolated mean survival estimate in the placebo arm that is statistically significantly higher than
24 months (95% CI 34 to 54 months). The same result is obtained for GI/lung NETs, for which the data
reject the null hypothesis that the life expectancy of the population is < 24 months (95% CI 44 to
86 months) at the 5% significance level.
Sunitinib is estimated to have a mean treatment effect of 5.9 months, using observed data from
A618111181, or 38.5 months, using a parametric (exponential) survival curve fitted to the OS data of the
two trials arms and extrapolated to 100 years of age. The treatment effect of everolimus in RADIANT-334
is 1.6 months using observed data and 14.7 months according to the extrapolated survival curve. The
respective estimates for everolimus in GI or lung NETs are 2.6 and 16.6 months.
In conclusion, the end-of-life criteria may be met only by sunitinib in the pNETs population of A6181111.81
In GI or lung NETs, life expectancy does not meet the end-of-life criteria set by NICE.37

Chapter 8 Discussion
Aim
The key objectives of this technology assessment report, in keeping with the final NICE scope, were
twofold: first, to estimate the clinical effectiveness of three interventions (everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE
and sunitinib) for treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression and, second, to
establish the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. The comparator treatments were chemotherapy,
interferon alpha and BSC.
During the course of this review, NICE consulted on amendments to the original final NICE scope.
Originally, lanreotide was included as an intervention and octreotide as a comparator. In the revised final
scope, agreed on 18 August 2016,30 lanreotide and octreotide were dropped.
Clinical effectiveness evidence
The interventions of interest were everolimus (NETs of pancreatic, GI or lung origin), 177Lu-DOTATATE
(NETs of pancreatic or GI origin) and sunitinib (pNETs).
Three trials, RADIANT-3,34 A618111181 and RADIANT-4,35 met the inclusion criteria for the clinical
effectiveness systematic review.
The risk of bias within the trials was low and remained comparable between the three studies regarding
selection, performance, detection, attrition and reporting bias.
Clinical effectiveness results: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
Key results only are given here. A fuller summary of the results is provided in Chapter 4, Summary.
Two trials provided evidence on the effectiveness of everolimus (RADIANT-334) and sunitinib (A618111181)
for the treatment of pNETs. Both interventions were compared with placebo. In both trials, BSC was also
given in both the intervention arm and the placebo arm.
Evidence consistently suggested a treatment effect in favour of both everolimus plus BSC and sunitinib plus
BSC compared with placebo plus BSC for the outcomes of interest.
Treatment with everolimus was associated with a 66% reduction in the risk of progression or death
(HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.44, by central review). Similarly, treatment with sunitinib was associated with
a 68% reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.55).
Treatment switching from the placebo arm to the treatment arm occurred in 73% of participants in
RADIANT-334 and 69% of participants in A6181111.81 The treatment switching significantly compromised
the OS results. The HR for unadjusted OS was reported to be 0.94 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.20; p = 0.30) in
RADIANT-334 and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.06; p = 0.094) in A6181111.81 Using the RPSFT model, the HR
for OS was reported to be 0.60 (95% CI 0.09 to 3.95) in RADIANT-334 and 0.34 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.28;
p = 0.094) in A6181111.81
Overall, AEs were more commonly reported following treatment with everolimus and sunitinib than
following treatment with placebo.

We compared everolimus with sunitinib in a simple ITC using the Bucher method.
Clinical effectiveness results: gastrointestinal/lung neuroendocrine tumours
One trial (RADIANT-435) provided evidence for the effectiveness of everolimus plus BSC in GI and
lung NETs.
Evidence consistently suggested a treatment effect in favour of the use of everolimus plus BSC compared
with placebo plus BSC for the outcomes of interest. Treatment with everolimus was associated with a 52%
reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.54). For OS, treatment
with everolimus plus BSC was associated initially with a 36% improvement for individuals with lung and
GI NETs compared with placebo (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.05). However, in follow-up data from the
company submission,33 a 27% improvement in OS following treatment with everolimus was reported
(HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.11); however, this was unadjusted for crossover.
Overall, AEs were more commonly reported following treatment with everolimus than following treatment
with placebo.
Clinical effectiveness results: gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours
Following a data request from us to Novartis, results from RADIANT-435 were provided for people recruited
with only GI NETs.
Median PFS for those with GI NETs from RADIANT-435 was 13.1 months for treatment with everolimus and
5.4 months for placebo (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84). OS estimated from a Kaplan–Meier curve at the
25th percentile was (confidential information has been removed) in the everolimus arm compared with
(confidential information has been removed) in the placebo arm.
Overall, AEs were more commonly reported following treatment with everolimus than following treatment
with placebo for people with GI NETs.
Clinical effectiveness results: lung neuroendocrine tumours
Following a data request from us to Novartis, results from RADIANT-435 were provided for people recruited
with only lung NETs.
Everolimus was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of disease progression compared with placebo.
Survival was improved by 44% following everolimus treatment compared with treatment with placebo.
Overall, AEs were more commonly reported following treatment with everolimus than following treatment
with placebo.
Strengths and limitations of the clinical effectiveness review
Strengths of the clinical effectiveness review
A strength of this study is that a systematic review of RCTs of everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib
in people with unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression was conducted to evaluate
relative efficacy. In the absence of head-to-head RCTs, an ITC was conducted to assess the relative efficacy
of everolimus and sunitinib for pNETs and everolimus and 177Lu-DOTATATE for GI NETs for the outcomes
of PFS, OS, RRs and AEs. The strength of our review was the systematic nature of our search and review of
published and unpublished data from the few available RCTs in this field, especially information held by
sponsoring companies, which were willing to provide commercial-in-confidence information through the
NICE process.
DISCUSSION
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk
102

Limitations of the clinical effectiveness review
l We were unable to compare 177Lu-DOTATATE with everolimus and sunitinib in individuals with pNETs,
as the NETTER-1 RCT102 did not include patients with pNETs.
l We were unable to compare any intervention with chemotherapy or interferon alpha, as there was no
randomised evidence.
l In several instances we were forced to rely on clinical results from the companies, rather than extracting
the data from peer-reviewed publications.
l We had to make many strong assumptions in the ITC comparing everolimus and 177Lu-DOTATATE in
GI NETs, primarily that 30 mg of octreotide is equivalent to placebo plus BSC; therefore, these analyses
should be treated with caution.
Cost-effectiveness
Systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies
We reviewed the cost-effectiveness literature according to the criteria set by the effectiveness review
complemented with criteria for the inclusion of costing studies relevant to the UK, economic evaluations
of interventions and modelling studies in this clinical area.
We identified three full economic evaluation studies, all relating to targeted treatments for advanced pNETs
in patients with progressive disease in countries other than the UK (the USA,120 Mexico121 and Poland123,144).
Two of these studies compared sunitinib plus BSC with BSC alone and one study compared everolimus with
sunitinib. All of these studies were supported by the companies sponsoring the treatments in question.
One study conducted in the USA and sponsored by Novartis found that everolimus was cost-effective
compared with sunitinib, based on an ICER for everolimus equivalent to £30,524 per QALY gained relative
to sunitinib at 2015 UK prices. This study was based on an ITC of relative outcomes compared with
placebo for RADIANT-334 and A6181111.81 A strength of the study was its use of matching methods that
acknowledge the heterogeneity in patient populations across trials.129 A weakness was its omission of BSC
alone as a comparator in its own right, especially as both RADIANT-334 and A618111181 included this
treatment option as a control arm.
A second study, conducted in Mexico and sponsored by Pfizer, found that sunitinib was cost-effective
based on an ICER equivalent to £32,842 per QALY gained compared with BSC alone at 2015 UK prices.
The study was based on trial data from A6181111.81 A strength of the study was its assessment of quality
of life using patient-reported outcomes in the trial. A weakness of the study was its omission of an active
treatment comparator in the economic evaluation. Another limitation is the fact that the study did not
adjust for the effect on OS of treatment crossover from placebo to sunitinib in the open-label phase of
A6181111,81 which results in an underestimation of health benefits and likely overestimation of the ICER
of initial treatment with sunitinib.
A third study, conducted in Poland and also sponsored by Pfizer, found that sunitinib was cost-effective
based on an ICER equivalent to £33,866 per QALY gained relative to BSC alone at 2015 UK prices. The
study was based on trial data from A6181111.81 A strength of the study was its adjustment for the effect
of crossover from placebo to sunitinib in the open-label phase of A6181111.81 One limitation was the lack
of an active treatment comparator in the evaluation. Another limitation was its use of outdated data from
the trial and limited reporting of methods used to measure utility values. This was the only identified full
report of a study conducted in this clinical area in Europe.
A fourth study, the only one identified that was conducted in the UK,122 which was also sponsored by
Pfizer, was reported as a conference poster. This summarised the evidence submitted to the SMC on
sunitinib compared with placebo in Scotland, according to which sunitinib was cost-effective based on an

ICER of £24,244 per QALY gained relative to placebo at 2015 UK prices. The strength of the study was its
adjustment for the effect of treatment crossover from placebo to sunitinib on OS. The main limitation was
the lack of adequate methodological detail available from the report.
Critique of the company model submissions
Of the three companies that submitted evidence to NICE, two included economic evaluations in their
submission. Novartis33 evaluated treatments in pNETs and GI and lung NETs. AAA31 evaluated treatments in
pNETs and GI NETs. Pfizer did not submit an economic evaluation.
The economic evaluation by Novartis used a partitioned survival model of sunitinib compared with
everolimus in pNETs, based on an ITC of placebo-controlled outcomes in A618111181 and RADIANT-3.34
The company found that sunitinib dominated everolimus as it had lower costs and produced more QALYs.
This result was derived by assuming equal PFS and OS outcomes between treatments, which in turn was
based on the CIs found in the ITC, that is, a PFS HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.99) and a RPFST-adjusted
OS HR of 1.39 (95% CI 0.17 to 11.72). As a result, the only health benefit on which treatments were
compared was HRQoL (state utility values) before disease progression (utility values after progression were
assumed to be the same between treatments). However, in the absence of utility data for everolimus from
RADIANT-3,34 the company imputed treatment differences according to the incidence of AEs and values of
their associated disutilities from a preference elicitation survey of the general public based on vignettes
designed by clinical experts. The assumption of equal outcomes of PFS and OS and the poor quality of the
utility data, which do not meet the NICE requirement that HRQoL data be derived from actual patient
outcomes, hamper the value of this evidence for NICE decision-making. Furthermore, the data used in this
evaluation by Novartis33 from A618111181 appear to be outdated.
A second evaluation by Novartis assessed everolimus plus BSC relative to BSC alone in the non-functional
GI and lung NETs population using data from RADIANT-4.35 Novartis found that everolimus had an ICER of
£43,642 per QALY gained relative to BSC alone or an ICER of (confidential information has been removed)
when a PAS discount of (confidential information has been removed) was applied to the list price. The
main strength of this assessment was its use of data from RADIANT-435 to populate the model parameters.
The main limitations were the immaturity of the OS data in the trial, the lack of adjustment for treatment
crossover to targeted treatments and the lack of adjustment for treatment switching before disease
progression (13% and 14% in the everolimus and placebo arms respectively), which was dealt with by
censoring data for switching cases at the time of the switch. Finally, the study adopted a high frequency
of oncologist visits.33
Advanced Accelerator Applications submitted an evaluation in pNETs of 177Lu-DOTATATE compared with
everolimus and sunitinib but the value of the resulting evidence is questionable as it was based on trial data
from NETTER-1,102 which included only midgut NETs patients. Furthermore, the AAA evaluation lacked BSC as
a relevant comparator. The company also submitted an assessment of 177-Lu-DOTATATE compared with
everolimus in the GI NETs subpopulation of SSTR+ patients, which produced a base-case ICER of (confidential
information has been removed). This evidence is also of limited quality as it involved an ITC of NETTER-1
outcome data with data from RADIANT-4,35 which included non-midgut GI and lung NETs. This analysis by
AAA in the GI NET population also omitted BSC alone, a relevant comparator. There is also a limitation in that
costs did not include resource use for disease monitoring, for example oncologist visits and the costs of
177Lu-DOTATATE administration were underestimated.31
Strengths and limitations of the evidence from company model submissions
The company submissions benefit from having individual patients from the few trials available to
inform their assessments. The main limitation with the submitted evidence is the lack of adequate
comparators for the case of pNETs and the lack of adequate comparisons with 177Lu-DOTATATE in the
NETTER-1 population of GI (midgut) NETs. In GI and lung NETs the main issue is the selective use of utility
data from RADIANT-4,35 in particular the use of the same utility values in stable disease for the two
treatment strategies, everolimus plus BSC and BSC alone, when treatment-specific values are available.
DISCUSSION

104

The available evidence from the submitted models provides cost information that is not found in the publicly
available sources. In particular, details on the frequency of patients using medications or non-medical
treatments in stable disease and disease progression in GI and lung NETs from RADIANT-435 are uniquely
available from this source. On the other hand, the evidence on treatment regimens used and the frequency
of contacts with health professionals was based on a validation of a previous expert survey, which provided
limited data on resource use for these patients in progressive disease. Cost data on pNETs are limited,
particularly for A6181111,81 with, for example, information on treatments used after disease progression not
collected for this trial.
Given the limitations of the evidence from industry submissions and the literature, the AG requested
from Novartis individual patient data from RADIANT-3 to replicate some of the ITCs (MAICs) and
adjustment for treatment crossover in pNETs. The company declined to provide the MAIC analysis data,
noting that the analyses in question did not inform its economic evaluation. However, the company did
agree to provide data on its adjustment of OS outcomes for crossover in RADIANT-348,69 which the AG
could use to replicate the company’s findings submitted to NICE. Pfizer also agreed to provide its individual
patient data and code for its own crossover-adjusted OS results, but only individual data from an outdated
data cut-off were provided, and in the absence of the code and updated OS data the AG could not
replicate the company’s findings. We did manage, however, to conduct exploratory analyses for the
matched ITC, matching the A618111181 sample of individual patient data to the RADIANT-435 baseline
characteristics. This highlighted the limitations associated with simple standard Bucher-type comparisons
underpinning the Novartis submission,33 originating from the small sample size of A618111181 and the
consequent imbalance in key baseline characteristics between trial arms, that is, PS, time since diagnosis
and number of disease sites.
In the light of the above limitations of the evidence base, development of an independent de novo
economic model was undertaken by the AG.
Independent economic assessment
The AG built a three-health-state partitioned survival model in two NET patient populations. One was
in patients with advanced pNETs and evaluated sunitinib plus BSC, everolimus plus BSC and BSC alone
over a lifetime horizon. These analyses were based on Bucher-type indirect comparisons of outcomes from
RADIANT-334 and A6181111.81 The second evaluation compared everolimus plus BSC with BSC alone in
patients with non-functional GI and lung NETs, based on RADIANT-435 data. In addition, we conducted a
subgroup analysis of everolimus plus BSC, BSC alone and 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide in
the GI (midgut) population using PFS data for this subgroup from RADIANT-435 and indirectly comparative
data on 177-Lu-DOTATATE from NETTER-1.
The models were populated with parameter estimates from time-to-event analyses of recreated individual
patient OS and PFS survival data digitised from the latest OS and PFS Kaplan–Meier curves from published
sources and industry submissions. Resource use model parameters were populated with data from the Novartis
submission,33 with modifications to reflect our clinical experts’ opinions of resource use intensity associated
with disease monitoring. Prices and other details adhered to the NICE reference case recommendations.
In the pNETs population, we found that sunitinib had an ICER of £20,717 per QALY gained relative to
BSC alone, at the current list price. The corresponding figure for everolimus was £45,493 per QALY
gained. These figures imply that sunitinib is superior to everolimus as it may achieve the same amount of
benefit at a lower cost to the NHS. In the GI and lung population, everolimus had an ICER of £44,557 per
QALY gained relative to BSC alone. In the GI (midgut) subgroup, the ICER for everolimus relative to BSC
alone was £199,233 per QALY gained. It must be noted that the results in the GI (midgut) subgroup are
affected by a high level of uncertainty because of PFS-based imputation of OS outcomes in the model,
as we did not have available actual OS data on this subgroup of RADIANT-435 patients.

In our additional indirect comparison in the GI (midgut) population (adjusting for background mortality),
for everolimus we found an ICER of £78,330 per QALY gained relative to BSC alone, at the current list
price; the respective figure for 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide was £62,158 per QALY gained.
Both these results and the results from a scenario analysis based on outcomes up to disease progression
produced lower ICERs relative to BSC alone for 177Lu-DOTATATE than for everolimus.
Our scenario analyses in the pNETs patient population show that the cost-effectiveness of targeted treatment
relies critically on adjusting for the effects of crossover from placebo to sunitinib on OS. At current list prices,
the ICERs for initial treatment with sunitinib and everolimus relative to BSC were £37,217 and £136,455 per
QALY gained, respectively, without adjustment for crossover, that is, 1.5 and 3 times the base-case values.
Our sensitivity analyses suggest that there is a high degree of uncertainty arising from the immaturity of OS
data in GI and lung NETs and from NETTER-1 data.102 In particular, there is evidence that the cost-effectiveness
of everolimus in GI and lung NETs depends on benefits that arise in the later years of life, and it is thus
sensitive to the discount rate.
The above figures appear to suggest that the data for sunitinib are more robust than those for everolimus
in both pNETs and GI and lung NETs, which are more sensitive to adjustment for treatment crossover and
the effects of the time horizon and discounting. In addition, 177Lu-DOTATATE was found to produce the
largest health benefits of all treatment strategies investigated for GI (midgut) NETs, that is, 1.76 and 0.91
more years of life than the BSC alone and everolimus strategies, respectively. These figures are remarkable,
especially because the fact that 60 mg of octreotide was given in the control arm would suggest that the
health benefits of 177Lu-DOTATATE relative to other treatments are underestimated in our analysis.
On request from the NICE appraisal committee, we performed further analyses for lung NETs (see addendum
in Appendix 17) and, separately, the overall GI location (see addendum in Appendix 19) using RADIANT-4
data on these populations extracted from survival curves provided in analyses performed by Novartis in
response to our assessment herein. We found that in these two locations and at current list prices,
everolimus has ICERs of > £20,000 per QALY relative to BSC (base case: overall GI location £26,383;
lung £31,016).
Strengths and limitations of the independent economic assessment
Our analysis of pNETs was based on the most up-to-date effectiveness data from the RCT informing the ITC
of the targeted treatments sunitinib and everolimus. (For the comparison of our results with the company
results see Appendix 23.) However, the ITC underlying our economic analysis was of a simple Bucher type,
unadjusted for any differences in the baseline characteristics across the two trials. Our cost-effectiveness
results may thus be biased if indeed the patients in the two trials come from populations with different
prognoses. Our comparison of the PFS curves of the BSC arms across trials suggests that the diseases of the
two patient groups have different propensities to progress and, given the theoretical and empirical evidence
linking PFS and OS outcomes, different associated death risks. In such a case the results would remain valid if
the proportional effect of targeted treatments over BSC alone is constant across levels of baseline disease
and death risks. Confidential information has been removed.
Nevertheless, caveats are due with respect to the small size of the A618111181 trial, which resulted in
an imbalance in key baseline characteristics. A Bucher-type analysis does not adequately deal with bias
arising from such an imbalance in baseline characteristics across arms within the same trial. Confidential
information has been removed. Our findings on 177LU-DOTATATE are based on a limited quantity and
quality of data available for the ITC with everolimus. The immaturity of the available effectiveness data
from NETTER-1, and the fact that the control arm received 60 mg of octreotide and therefore was of a
different nature to BSC in the RADIANT-435 GI (midgut) subgroup, suggests that these results need to
be considered with caution. It is not clear, in particular, whether or not the GI (midgut) subgroup of
RADIANT-435 represents a patient population with a similar prognosis to that in NETTER-1. Nevertheless,
our scenario and sensitivity analyses, adjusting for the extent of optimism in our long-term survival

projections, suggest that, based on the early evidence from NETTER-1, 177Lu-DOTATATE may produce at
least as much value for money as everolimus does in the GI (midgut) NETs patient population.
Further research is required to investigate the robustness of the findings presented here. In particular,
the availability of individual patient data from RADIANT-334 would allow the robustness of the findings
to be tested and would be better suited for that task than the individual patient data from A618111181
made available to us by Pfizer. This is because RADIANT-334 was a larger trial and therefore is less subject
to instability than A618111181 as a result of small effective sample sizes remaining after matching,
Similar analyses will be required to assess the robustness of indirect comparisons with 177Lu-DOTATATE
outcomes in the NETTER-1 trial102 using Bucher-type compared with more elaborate methods of indirect
comparison, while adjusting for treatment crossover. Information on the quality-of-life outcomes measured
in NETs patients receiving targeted treatments is also required, as such information is available only for
patients in stable disease who are subject to high rates of missing data.
The analyses presented as addenda to this report, for the lung (see Appendix 17) and separately for the
overall GI population (see Appendix 19) in RADIANT-4,35 are subject to the limitations already discussed for
RADIANT-435 data. In addition, we could not verify the quality of the OS data for the overall GI group as
the only information available was a single Kaplan–Meier curve provided by the company in response to
our assessment. Further research is needed to confirm our findings in the overall GI location.
The current study seeks to provide evidence to inform the optimal choice of initial treatment in advanced,
progressive pNETs and GI and lung NETs. The nature of the available evidence limited our analysis and
the type of questions that we could address. Our assessment therefore provides very limited information on
questions such as choice of treatment sequences. Another important question on which the present analysis
may shed some light is whether targeted treatments may be given initially or after disease progression in
patients who have progressive disease. The further availability of data on subsequent treatments after
disease progression may allow more precise answers than those allowed by this assessment.

Patient data
This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support. Using
patient data is vital to improve health and care for everyone. There is huge potential to make better use of
information from people’s patient records, to understand more about disease, develop new treatments,
monitor safety, and plan NHS services. Patient data should be kept safe and secure, to protect everyone’s
privacy, and it’s important that there are safeguards to make sure that it is stored and used responsibly.
Everyone should be able to find out about how patient data are used. #datasaveslives You can find out

Appendix 2 Review of effectiveness for
non-randomised controlled trial evidence for
177Lu-DOTATATE
Methods
This section details the methods used in the identification and synthesis of studies reporting non￾randomised 177Lu-DOTATATE data, as no relevant RCT data were available for 177Lu-DOTATATE.
Identification of studies
Study identification was undertaken in May 2016, with update searches carried out in September 2016.
Our literature searches were not limited by study design and so the same searches were used to identify
randomised and non-randomised studies.
The searches are reported in Chapter 4 and Appendix 1.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Non-randomised studies of individuals with pNETs or GI NETs receiving 177Lu-DOTATATE and reporting
outcomes of interest were included in the review. Non-randomised evidence included prospective observational
cohort studies, both comparative and single-arm studies. Case studies were excluded.
Screening
Titles and abstracts were independently double-screened by two reviewers. Full texts of studies meeting
the inclusion criteria at title and abstract stage were double-screened by three reviewers.
Data extraction and management
A standardised data specification form was used and the data extracted were independently checked. When
multiple publications of the same study were identified, data were extracted and reported as if a single study.
Extracted and tabulated information included country of study, number of participants, location of tumour,
dose of 177Lu-DOTATATE, any additional drugs given, baseline characteristics of participants (age,
percentage of male participants, tumour functionality, tumour differentiation and ECOG or WHO PS) and
whether or not any previous treatments had been given. Outcomes extracted included follow-up duration,
PFS, OS, RR, AEs and HRQoL.
Critical appraisal strategy
Included studies were not critically appraised.
Methods of data synthesis
Data are presented in summary tables. The following outcomes have been narratively synthesised in the
following section: PFS, OS, RR, AEs and HRQoL.
Results for non-randomised controlled trial evidence
Quantity and quality of research available
A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram is presented in
Figure 26. Studies were coded separately in the first round of screening so that they could be reintroduced
if (and in this case) necessary.

Overview of results
All 32 included studies103,104,145–174 were case series with no internal controls. There was a wide variation
in the number of study participants (n = 5–310), with only four103,104,163,164 out of the 32 studies having
> 100 study participants. Studies were conducted in participants with a wide range of baseline characteristics.
For outcome measures, following treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE, PFS ranged from 10 to 40 months
and OS ranged from 34.2 to 105 months. In terms of RRs, complete response ranged from 2% to 27%
and partial response ranged from 12% to 100% [with a standard deviation (SD) range from 12%
to 100%].
This wide variation in outcome measures is likely to be because of factors inherent in study design and
compounded by wide variations in participant characteristics, for example tumour sites, with outcomes often
reported for mixed tumour locations, for example data gut, pancreas and lung NETs grouped together.

Twenty-three143,145–152,155,158–168,170,171 of the 32 studies reported on AEs, whereas seven143,146,148,152,154,159,161 of
the 32 studies reported on HRQoL outcomes.
The extreme sensitivity of outcomes to apparently small variations in study features, particularly case mix,
illustrates the great importance of having studies with parallel control groups, ideally with participants
being randomly allocated, to assess the effectiveness of treatments. Without controlled studies it is very
difficult to determine whether differences in outcomes between case series for a new treatment (in this
case 177Lu-DOTATATE) and case series for existing treatments are attributable to differences in treatments
or differences in prognostic factors.
Non-randomised controlled trials of 177Lu-DOTATATE
No non-RCT comparative trials were identified; all 32 studies identified were single-arm trials. The baseline
characteristics of these 32 trials are provided in Table 38 and the outcomes in the trials are provided in
Table 39.

Appendix 6 Additional evidence from the
NETTER-1 trial
The NETTER-1 trial was identified through four published abstracts103–106 in accordance with the original
NICE scope. The NETTER-1 trial was not included in the systematic review in this assessment report as it
did not meet the revised inclusion criteria in the updated scope issued by NICE on 18 August 2016.30 As
the NETTER-1 trial is the only RCT to have assessed the effectiveness of 177Lu-DOTATATE, the AG has
presented the findings from the trial here.
There are currently four published abstracts103–106 relating to the NETTER-1 trial in the public domain. Data
provided on the NETTER-1 trial in this appendix are from the company submission (AAA)31 or are data
given to the AG following a request to AAA. The data presented in the company submission are from
taken from the CSR for the NETTER-1 trial.175
Study design
The NETTER-1 trial compared treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE plus BSC (30 mg of octreotide LAR) with
treatment with high-dose octreotide LAR (60 mg). All participants had metastatic midgut NETs and were
previously receiving octreotide LAR (20 or 30 mg) prior to randomisation to the trial.31
Participants were recruited from 41 centres and were stratified by highest radiotracer uptake observed
on planar somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and by the length of time on a constant dose of octreotide
(≤ 6 and > 6 months).
177Lu-DOTATATE was administered in a dose of 7.4 GBq (200 mCi), over 8 ± 1-week intervals. For kidney
protection, amino acid infusions (Vamin 18 in European centres and Aminosyn II 10% in the US centres)
were given concomitantly with 177Lu-DOTATATE; for symptom control, 30 mg of octreotide LAR was
given. For the comparator arm, 60 mg of octreotide LAR was given every 4 weeks. Additional octreotide
subcutaneous rescue injections were allowed in either arm if clinical symptoms associated with the
carcinoid tumour were experienced. Average dose intensity was 25.6 GBq overall and 7.2 GBq per cycle.
A sample size of 230 was calculated as being required for statistical significance for PFS and OS. A total of
229 patients were recruited to the trial.31

exposed to (confidential information has been removed) of 177Lu-DOTATATE. The study is still ongoing.
Rationale for the choice of comparator
In the company submission, AAA reported that:
The use of octreotide LAR in the control arm was appropriate in terms of both study design and ethical
considerations as to provide patients of the control arm with the best standard of care. A higher dose
was required by the regulatory authorities at the time of the parallel scientific advice meeting with the
FDA and EMA considering that the patients enrolled in the trial had have progressive disease following
20 or 30 mg octreotide LAR, and it was not ethical to maintain them on the same dose regimen.
Consequently, 60 mg octreotide LAR at 4-week intervals dose was agreed for the control arm in the
absence of an alternative efficacious treatment approved for this type of tumour.

Subgroup analysis
No subgroup analysis was carried out by AAA for the NETTER-1 trial.31
Indirect treatment comparison
Methods: intended indirect treatment comparison
Data on the effectiveness of everolimus and 177Lu-DOTATATE in participants with GI NETs were identified
from RADIANT-435 (everolimus + BSC vs. placebo + BSC) and NETTER-131 (177Lu-DOTATATE + 30 mg
of octreotide vs. 60 mg of octreotide). The AG intended to indirectly compare everolimus with
177Lu-DOTATATE for GI NETs as shown in Figure 27.
To enable an indirect comparison, a trial connecting placebo and BSC to 60 mg of octreotide was required.
The AG found no such trial in the primary searches and so two supplementary bibliographic database
searches were undertaken to find evidence to link these studies.
Search 1: randomised controlled trials of octreotide
The first search attempted to identify studies reporting RCTs of octreotide. The search syntax took the
following form: ((search terms for neuroendocrine tumours) AND (search terms for octreotide (any dose)
AND (a study design literature search filter for RCTs)).
This search was run in the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE In-Process & Other
Non-Indexed Citations (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid) and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Wiley Interface).
Search 2: searches for dosing studies
The second search attempted to identify dosing or dose-ranging studies. The search syntax took the following
form: ((search terms for Octreotide (any dose) AND (free text to capture reference to dosing studies)).
This search was run in the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE In-Process & Other
Non-Indexed Citations (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid).
The searches were not limited by language or date and both searches are fully reported in Appendix 5.
Results of searches
Search 1 (RCTs of octreotide) identified 83 citations for screening. Screening criteria were defined as RCTs,
NETs population and octreotide given in doses of ≥ 30 mg. One study was eligible for inclusion in the
review (PROMID),176 in which 30 mg of octreotide LAR was compared with placebo (n = 42 vs. n = 43

respectively). Individuals recruited to the PROMID study were treatment naive. Following consultation
with our clinicians, it was considered by the AG that the population of treatment-naive patients was not
comparable to the populations in RADIANT-435 and NETTER-1,31 with a minimum of 59% of the population
in RADIANT-435 and 100% of the population in NETTER-131 having had at least one previous treatment.
Search 2 (dosing studies) identified 180 citations for screening. Screening criteria were defined as RCTs,
NETs population and octreotide given in doses to include at least 30 mg or 60 mg in one arm. No studies
were eligible for inclusion in the review.
Methods: actual indirect treatment comparison
As additional trials comparing placebo plus BSC with 60 mg of octreotide could not be found, the
intended ITC in Figure 27 could not be performed. In consultation with clinical experts, and in the absence
of evidence to suggest otherwise, the AG did not think that it was appropriate to link the RADIANT-435
and NETTER-131 trials by assuming that placebo plus BSC (as used in RADIANT-435) was equivalent to
60 mg of octreotide (as used in NETTER-1;31 Figure 28).
However, in a sensitivity analysis, the AG has made the strong assumption that placebo and BSC can
be considered equivalent to 60 mg of octreotide, although this ITC should be interpreted with caution.
Moreover, the data used for this network were obtained through a request for data by the AG to the
companies as the NETTER-1 trial31 is currently unpublished and RADIANT-435 does not report outcomes for
the subgroup of participants with GI NETs only (instead, RADIANT-435 reports outcomes for the combined
group of GI + lung NETs).
In addition, a further caveat to this ITC is the different tumour locations included under the overarching
term of GI in the two RCTs and hence included in the ITC. NETTER-131 recruited only individuals with
midgut NETs, whereas RADIANT-435 recruited those with fore-, mid- and hind-gut NETs. Table 43 reports
the tumour locations of the individuals recruited to NETTER-131 and RADIANT-4.35
The results reported for GI NETs only from RADIANT-435 in the clinical effectiveness section in Chapter 4
(see Outcomes for RCT evidence for GI NETs) include all of the tumour locations in Table 43 except for
‘unknown’ and one less participant in the everolimus group for ‘other’. This resulted in a total of n = 118
for everolimus plus BSC (down from n = 142) and n = 57 for placebo plus BSC (down from n = 70). The
definition of GI NETs omitting the ‘unknown’ location was used by Singh et al.73 in their published poster.
The definition of GI used by Singh et al.73 is the definition of GI that the AG used in its ITC for NETTER-1.31
Despite the concerns raised above, the Bucher method41 was used to indirectly compare everolimus with
177Lu-DOTATATE in individuals with GI NETs for the following outcomes: central review of PFS, OS, RR
and various AEs. Because there were only two relevant trials for this synthesis we could not undertake any
analyses for heterogeneity between the trials or inconsistency in the network.

For AEs, instead of providing data on all grades of AE and grade 3 and 4 AEs as requested by the AG,
AAA provided data on all grades of AEs and grade 3–5 AEs from NETTER-1;31 Novartis provided the
requested data for all grades of AEs and for grade 3 and 4 AEs from RADIANT-4.35 As grade 5 AEs
are defined as death associated with an AE, the AG attempted to identify whether or not any deaths
associated with AEs had occurred in RADIANT-4.35 Confidential information has been removed. It was
therefore assumed that data on the grade 3–5 AEs provided by AAA could be compared with data
on the grade 3 and 4 AEs provided by Novartis.
Results
Two RCTs were used to compare everolimus with 177Lu-DOTATATE: RADIANT-435 (everolimus + BSC vs.
placebo + BSC) and NETTER-131 (177Lu-DOTATATE + 30 mg of octreotide vs. 60 mg of octreotide)
(see Figure 28).
For PFS, the ITC (Table 44) suggested that 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide is associated with a
statistically significant reduction of 63% in disease progression or death compared with everolimus plus BSC.
The results of the ITC for OS (Table 45) suggest that a (confidential information has been removed) in the
hazard for death with 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide compared with everolimus plus BSC;
however, this result is associated with a wide 95% CI (confidential information has been removed).
From the available data on response rates (Table 46), the ITC results suggest that objective response and
stable disease (confidential information has been removed) with everolimus plus BSC than 177Lu-DOTATATE
plus 30 mg of octreotide: objective response (confidential information has been removed); stable disease

Appendix 8 Evidence informing the companies’
economic models
Novartis
The characteristics of the models submitted by Novartis are summarised in Table 65. See Table 76 for
the results.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
Efficacy, effectiveness and safety evidence
The systematic review by Novartis involved searching major electronic libraries (see sections 4 and 5 of
the company submission33) on 21 July 2016, as well as hand searches of conference proceedings on
8 August 2016. The two identified trials have been described earlier in this report (see Chapter 4, Results).
Here, only the major results and design features for the purposes of economic analysis are summarised.
RADIANT-3,34 a Phase III double-blind RCT, assessed 10 mg of everolimus given orally plus BSC relative to
matched placebo plus BSC in 410 adult, mTOR inhibitor-naive patients with progressive and advanced
pNETs. Participants were randomised on a 1 : 1 ratio to the two treatments in a stratified fashion according
to their baseline status in terms of prior chemotherapy (receipt vs. no receipt) and WHO PS (0 vs. 1/2).
According to the effectiveness section of the Novartis submission,33 the median follow-up period in
RADIANT-334 was 17 months, with median treatment durations of (confidential information has been
removed) for everolimus compared with 3.74 months for placebo. However, in the economic analysis
section, the median treatment duration for everolimus is reported as 8.61 (Novartis submission, p. 10133).
At the time that the primary publication was written (cut-off date of 28 February 2010), 32% of participants in
the everolimus group and 13% of participants in the placebo group were still receiving the allocated treatment;
44% in the everolimus group had stopped because of disease progression and 80% in the placebo group had
stopped for the same reason.34 Participants in the placebo group whose disease subsequently progressed were
eligible to cross over to open-label everolimus. Of those patients initially randomised to placebo, 85% received
open-label everolimus. In addition, both groups received BSC, which involved SSA use in 37.7% and 39.9% of
participants in the everolimus and placebo groups, respectively.
The primary analysis (based on assessment by a local investigator) found that median PFS was 11.0 months
(95% CI 8.4 to 13.9 months) for everolimus compared with 4.6 months (95% CI 3.1 to 5.4 months) for
placebo, with a HR for disease progression or death for everolimus of 0.35 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.45). The
assessment by central review found a HR of 0.34 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.44). The final OS analysis, which was
unadjusted for crossover to everolimus, performed with data available on 5 March 2014, produced a median
OS of 44.0 months for the everolimus group and 37.7 months for the placebo group and a HR for everolimus
of 0.94 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.20). In the Novartis submission33 it was acknowledged that these results ‘may be
confounded due to the high level of cross-over from placebo to everolimus and the receipt of subsequent
anti-neoplastic therapies’. In particular, (confidential information has been removed) of everolimus group
received antineoplastic therapies after discontinuation of the study drug compared with (confidential
information has been removed) of the placebo group. In total, 23% of patients in the everolimus group and
19.2% in the placebo group received a targeted therapy, whereas 29% of participants in each arm
received chemotherapy.
The company conducted an OS analysis in which it adjusted for the effect of crossover from the placebo to
the everolimus group, whether as a result of disease progression or after completing the core phase and
entering the open-label phase of the study. The method used for this purpose was the RPSFT model,

which assumes that the effect of treatment on OS is the same whenever the patient receives the treatment,
for example at the start of the trial, after disease progression or after completing the core phase of the
study. Although the duration of follow-up in RADIANT-334 was 72–78 months, the RPSFT analysis effectively
required limiting the follow-up to 24 months after the start of treatment and produced a HR of 0.60 (95% CI
0.09 to 3.95).62
The other RCT identified by the company’s systematic review was A6181111,81 which compared 37.5 mg
of sunitinib daily plus BSC against placebo plus BSC.81 As with RADIANT-3,34 A618111181 was conducted
in patients with progressive, advanced and well- or moderately differentiated pNETs and measured the
same primary outcome, PFS. Similarly, participants randomised to placebo were allowed to cross over to
open-label active treatment, sunitinib, following disease progression. In total, 51% of participants in the
sunitinib arm (n = 44/86) and 69% of participants in the placebo arm (n = 59/85) entered the open-label
extension study.81 The median treatment duration was 4.6 months for sunitinib and 3.7 months for
placebo. The most common reasons for study discontinuation were disease progression (occurring in 22%
of sunitinib and 55% of placebo cases), termination of the trial (48% and 19%) and AEs (17% and 8%).81
In a separate report referred to by Pfizer in its submission, it is stated that 38, that is, two-thirds, of the
placebo group who crossed over did so following disease progression, whereas 21 in the placebo group
started sunitinib after the study closure88 (see Chapter 4, Results, for further details of A618111181).
In the absence of head-to-head RCT evidence, Novartis resorted to an indirect comparison of everolimus
with sunitinib based on their respective relative outcomes compared with placebo in RADIANT-334 and
A618111181 using the method of Bucher et al.41 The relative effect of the treatments on OS was estimated
using ITT analysis and, alternatively, RPSFT model-adjusted HRs. For the comparison based on the RPSFT
model OS estimates, Novartis cites a HR for sunitinib of 0.43 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.20) without clear reference
as to the source. In contrast, in its submission, Pfizer cites a HR for sunitinib relative to placebo of 0.34
(95% CI 0.14 to 1.28).88
Novartis reported a PFS HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.99; blinded independent review committee) and an ITT
OS HR of 1.32 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.16) and a RPFST model-adjusted OS HR of 1.39 (95% CI 0.17 to 11.72).
The company also found that the HR for SSA use as part of BSC was 1.04 (95% CI 0.48 to 2.26) for
everolimus relative to sunitinib. The company concluded that there was no significant difference between
the treatments in terms of these outcomes.
In terms of AEs, the company’s Bucher indirect comparison analysis resulted in an overall OR of 4.47
(95% CI 0.5 to 39.4) for an overall rate of grade 3–4 AEs of 0.35 for everolimus compared with an indirectly
estimated overall rate of 0.71 for sunitinib. These data were used by Novartis to estimate the relative
incidence of AEs and associated costs and utilities in the economic model, by assuming that the AEs in
question occurred only once for each individual. As the types of grade 3–4 AEs for which sunitinib had an
excess risk compared with everolimus occurred less frequently (i.e. neutropenia, hypertension, leukopenia
and palmar–plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome occurred in < 1% of participants) than those for which
everolimus had worse outcomes (i.e. diarrhoea, stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, hyperglycaemia,
fatigue, infections, pneumonitis and nausea occurred in 3–7% of participants), the excess risks estimated by
the Bucher method across individual AE categories added up to a larger total with everolimus than sunitinib.
Thus, although sunitinib had a higher incidence of any of the 13 grade 3/4 AEs considered, the IC of
individual categories produced absolute AE rates that implied the opposite, that is, that everolimus was
associated with more of any of these events. As described in the critique of their submission (see Chapter 5),
the company addressed this contradiction in an ad hoc manner in the economic evaluation.
In its submission, Novartis also included the results of a published indirect comparative study between
everolimus and sunitinib that analysed placebo-controlled outcome data from RADIANT-334 and A618111181
using the MAIC method.124 A detailed discussion of this evidence is presented in Chapter 4 (see Results).
The MAIC PFS HR for everolimus compared with sunitinib was estimated to be 0.84 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.53).

This estimate was smaller although statistically indistinguishable from the PFS HR estimate of 0.90 (0.53 to
1.53) before matching and the PFS HR of 1.08 from the Bucher analysis by Novartis, described above.
Matching to the A618111181 sample reduced the relative effectiveness of everolimus compared with
sunitinib from the unadjusted OS HR of 0.69 (0.46 to 1.05) to the MAIC OS HR of 0.81 (0.49 to 1.31).
The MAIC pooled OR for the subset of eight AEs (neutropenia, hypertension, palmar–plantar
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, diarrhoea, stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and fatigue) was 1.16,
which is smaller than the corresponding Bucher indirect comparison estimate of 1.37 (calculated by
PenTAG from data in the Novartis submission; see Appendix 21). More importantly, unlike the Bucher IC
estimates used by Novartis to populate the economic model, the MAIC AE rate estimates added up to
similar totals for sunitinib and everolimus for the subset of common categories (0.38 vs. 0.37, respectively)
(in contrast, the Bucher rates were 0.15 and 0.29, respectively; PenTAG calculations of Novartis data
submitted to NICE33). In contrast, a MAIC pooled placebo-adjusted OR for sunitinib compared with
everolimus of 1.37 (calculated by the AG) for the 14 grade 3/4 AEs had been reported previously by
Signorovitch et al.124 using older RADIANT-334 data.
The company concluded that there was no evidence of any difference between everolimus and sunitinib in
terms of PFS, OS and SSA use. It also concluded that sunitinib led to a higher risk of grade 3/4 AEs, with a
different tolerability profile between the two treatments. This led the company to adopt a base case in
which both treatments had equal PFS and OS effectiveness. In addition, it cautioned about the potential
bias as a result of heterogeneity between the populations in the trials (RADIANT-334 and A618111181) used
in the Bucher indirect comparison, which was used as the source of the economic model parameters.
The AE estimates were obtained using the primary analysis cut-off date of 28 February 2010. In addition,
Novartis presented updated results on AEs that occurred in the double-blind and extension phases of
RADIANT-3,34 with a cut-off date of 5 March 2014. These are not discussed here as they were not used in
the Novartis economic evaluation.
The company also presented commercial-in-confidence data from a non-randomised, unpublished study,
the OBLIQUE trial, in advanced pNETs patients treated with 10 mg of everolimus in routine practice. The
study involved 46 patients who were followed up for 6 months from treatment initiation, with HRQoL
measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ GINET21 (European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer 21-item Quality of Life Questionnaire for gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours)
and the EQ-5D. This study found that HRQoL was maintained over the observation period. In particular, the
mean EQ-5D score was 0.72 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.77) at baseline, 0.67 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.73) at 3 months
and 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.78) at 6 months. This study is important as it is the only source identified by the
AG containing utility values for patients on everolimus in the advanced pNETs population (see Chapter 6,
Systematic review of utilities, for the AG’s review of utilities). However, Novartis did not discuss how the
population from which these utility values were measured differs from the trial populations of RADIANT-334
and A6181111.81
Novartis review of economic models and their results
Novartis conducted a systematic literature review of economic evaluation studies, including studies on
resource utilisation, costs and utilities. It identified two studies as being relevant to the NICE scope for this
assessment, namely the economic evaluations of sunitinib plus BSC relative to BSC and of everolimus
relative to sunitinib or BSC in progressive, advanced pNETs, as reported in the previous company
submission to the SMC133,178 and All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG).179,180
One of the identified studies was the poster publication by Johns et al.,
122 reviewed in Appendix 10, which
reported an ICER of £22,587 per QALY gained for sunitinib compared with placebo. The other study was
the SMC178 and AWMSG180 submission on everolimus, which in the SMC analysis178 was found to have an
ICER of £14,562 per QALY gained compared with sunitinib and £24,998 per QALY gained compared with
BSC; in the analysis for the AWMSG,180 the respective values were £12,894 and £24,999.

The above evidence is likely to be outdated because of recently updated data and analyses, particularly in
relation to evidence adjusted for treatment crossover, and therefore an updated review and analyses
are warranted.
Data and methods
Efficacy and effectiveness data used in the model
The model used parametric curves fitted to the PFS individual patient data from the everolimus arm of
RADIANT-334 to estimate the proportion of patients in stable disease during the observed period in the trial
(up to 25 months) and to extrapolate beyond it up to 20 years. The sunitinib arm PFS was estimated by
applying estimates of the PFS HR from the ITC analyses described earlier in this appendix (see also Chapter 4,
Indirect treatment comparison: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours). OS for both treatments was derived
using the same approach as for PFS. The estimated PFS and OS curves were used to partition the total
proportion of patients alive at any given time into the proportion in the progression-free state and the
proportion in the progressive state. The former proportion was obtained directly from PFS and the latter
indirectly, by subtracting the proportion of PFS from the corresponding OS proportion for the duration of
the 74-month trial observation period and up to 20 years.
Novartis explored different parametric failure time distributions to model PFS and OS in the everolimus arm
of RADIANT-3,34 including exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, log-normal and log-logistic models. To select
the base case, three criteria were used: the BIC, as a measure of goodness of fit that penalises model
complexity (i.e. the number of model parameters); the visual fit to the non-parametric Kaplan–Meier
curves; and the visual fit to the empirical hazard rates (i.e. the instantaneous probability of failure). In
addition, for the OS distributions, Novartis used external registry data from the SEER database to validate
the candidate models; in particular, the 15-year survival rate of 6% after diagnosis in the SEER database
was used to judge whether or not a model extrapolation beyond the end of the trial follow-up period
was plausible. Finally, Novartis discarded PFS distributions that crossed the preferred OS parametric
curve, which turned out to be the Weibull distribution. This led to the choice of the Weibull parametric
distribution for PFS with everolimus in preference to the log-logistic and log-normal distributions, as these
crossed the OS curve in the early part of the trial follow-up period. Other parametric functions not chosen
for the base case were used in sensitivity analyses.
The adopted approach to derive the OS and PFS curves for sunitinib implied the assumptions of constant
proportional hazards and, as the company acknowledged, that there were no confounders affecting the
relative treatment effects between everolimus and sunitinib. In support of the second assumption, the
submission states that the available subgroup analyses from both RADIANT-334 and A618111181 do not
suggest that treatment effects relative to placebo are modified by measured characteristics. In support of
the proportional hazards assumption, plots of the log cumulative hazard against the log of trial follow-up
time (log-log plots) were presented, suggesting a parallel pattern between the active arm and the placebo
arm in each trial.
The company warns that, because of crossover to the active treatment in the placebo arms of the two
trials, the OS HR derived from the Bucher indirect comparison may be biased because of differences in the
method used to adjust for treatment crossover in RADIANT-334 and A6181111,81 which was conducted
by Pfizer and available only to Novartis from aggregate results submitted to the SMC181 and AWMSG.124
In particular, Novartis argues that, as illustrated by the comparative log-log plots of the two analyses
(see figure 6.2 in the Novartis NICE submission33), the extent of recensoring needed for valid adjustment of
the placebo arm of RADIANT-334 using the RPSFT method produced a placebo OS curve (left-hand graph)
that was much shorter than the corresponding curve for placebo (right-hand graph) in the Pfizer RPSFT
analysis of A618111181 data. This led Novartis to propose that Pfizer may not have applied recensoring in
its analyses, which is needed for a valid estimation of treatment effect.128 The AG sought to verify this by
requesting from Pfizer the individual patient data and statistical analysis code needed to replicate the
company’s RPSFT analyses. In response, Pfizer provided the individual patient data without the analysis

212

code, which prevented the AG from replicating the Pfizer RPFST analysis and determining whether or not
the RPFST analyses by the two companies were comparable.
On the basis of the Bucher indirect comparison results showing that the HR for OS (RPSFT adjusted: 1.39,
95% CI 0.166 to 11.723) and PFS (local review: 0.833, 95% CI 0.490 to 1.417; central blinded investigator
review: 1.079, 95% CI 0.586 to 1.990) for everolimus compared with sunitinib had wide CIs around 1,
Novartis adopted a fixed HR value of 1 in the base case, that is, the assumption of no difference in effect
between the two treatments in terms of both PFS and OS outcomes.
As discussed earlier, these OS figures and the log-log plots from A618111181 are the same as the latest OS
results for that trial,88 which were presented in the Pfizer submission32 to NICE. Using the latest RPSFT-adjusted
OS HR of 0.34 for sunitinib compared with placebo and the corresponding estimate for everolimus used by
Novartis to derive the base-case (Bucher) HR of 0.60 for everolimus compared with sunitinib results in a
(Bucher) HR of 1.76 for everolimus compared with sunitinib [Pfizer conducted a MAIC analysis of everolimus
compared with sunitinib and found a MAIC OS HR of (confidential information has been removed), although
this was derived by matching to the A618111181 population and therefore is not comparable to the figures
in this section, which are matched to the RADIANT-334 population; Pfizer submission, p. 6832 and see earlier in
this appendix].
Adverse events The model measured only the costs and effect on HRQoL (disutility) of treatment-related
grade 3/4 AEs as the ‘grade 1 and 2 events [observed in RADIANT-334] would not be associated with any
meaningful management costs or impact on HRQoL’ (Novartis submission, p. 9733). Overall AE rates of 7%
for the everolimus arm of the model and 26% for the sunitinib arm from cycle 0 to cycle 25, set to 0%
thereafter, were applied (columns P and Q in ‘Survival’ sheet of Novartis’s pNETs Microsoft Excel model).
The everolimus rate was obtained from RADIANT-334 data, whereas the sunitinib rate was obtained by
scaling up this rate on the basis of the OR of 4.479 for sunitinib compared with everolimus for any grade
3/4 AEs from the Bucher indirect comparison conducted by Novartis (see Appendix 14, Novartis). However,
new grade 3/4 data provided by Pfizer32 as part of its submission to NICE suggest that the rate for sunitinib
is too high. Updating the Bucher analyses submitted by Novartis with the new Pfizer data results in a
pooled grade 3/4 HR of 1.37 for everolimus. In any case, as Novartis acknowledges, the validity of this
approach to estimate the economic impact of AEs hinges on the unverifiable and unlikely assumption that
patients did not experience multiple instances of the same grade 3/4 AE.
Although the model does not explicitly account for the effect of AEs on treatment use, it included a measure
of RDI for the targeted therapies recorded during the study period in RADIANT-334 and A6181111.81
Similarly, the costs of AEs in the model were assumed to apply only to the first 25 cycles. The role of AEs
in terms of treatment discontinuation was not explicitly modelled but accounted for independently by
adjustments to the dose intensity and treatment duration.
Novartis presented additional published estimates of the relative incidence of AEs between sunitinib and
everolimus from MAIC analysis of AE data from an earlier cut-off point124 than the data cut-off point in
the Bucher indirect comparison analysis (see table 4.5 in the Novartis submission33) that informed its
economic model. Although the two sources may refer to different populations, that is, the MAIC was
adjusted to the A618111181 population and the Bucher indirect comparison analysis was adjusted to the
RADIANT-334 population, comparison of the two sets of estimates suggests that the Bucher indirect
comparison leads to misleading AE rate estimates for the cost-effectiveness analyses. However, the
company decided not to use the MAIC estimates in the economic analysis because, in the previous
submission to the SMC, the appraisal committee’s opinion was that the method was ‘non-standard with
uncertainty as to the robustness of this type of analysis’ (Novartis submission, p. 4933). However, the overall
balance of grade 3/4 AE risk implied by the individual AE rates obtained from the Bucher indirect
comparison analysis was inconsistent with the pooled OR using the same method. Novartis used the
Bucher AE rates adjusted for this inconsistency.

Since Novartis assumed that everolimus and sunitinib had equal PFS and OS outcomes, the resulting cost
differences were driven, and the QALY differences completely determined, by the difference in the profile
of AEs experienced under the two treatments. As discussed earlier in this appendix, the rates of individual
types of AEs were determined by indirect comparison using the Bucher method. This led to differences
in grade 3/4 AE rates between the two treatments that were inconsistent with the ranking of the two
treatments in terms of pooled AEs: although the pooled OR indicated that sunitinib was associated with
a higher incidence of AEs, the individual rates for the 13 AEs considered in the Novartis model combined
implied the opposite. To address this contradiction, the company calculated costs and disutilities of AEs
as weighted averages of the costs and disutilities associated with managing and experiencing individual
AE types, using the Bucher-derived individual AE rates as weights. These weighted averages were then
multiplied by the overall incidence of any grade 3/4 AE in RADIANT-334 for everolimus and by the Bucher
pooled OR for sunitinib in its pNETs economic model. The same approach was used to estimate the costs
of AEs.
Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%, as indicated in the NICE reference case37 (see Appendix 9).
Utility values
The utility values in the model were obtained using a time trade-off preference elicitation exercise
conducted with 100 members of the general public. Individuals were asked to evaluate descriptors of health
states previously designed by clinical experts as representative of those experienced by pNETs patients in
routine practice. The analysis was generic in the sense that the vignettes assessed by participants in the
exercise did not include details about any particular treatment but instead presented states that described
stable disease (with and without AEs, including diarrhoea, palmar–plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome,
hyperglycaemia, nausea/vomiting, pneumonitis, rash, stomatitis and thrombocytopenia) or progressive
disease.131 This study was sponsored by Novartis. A discussion of this study is presented in the review of
utility values in Appendix 15 and Chapter 6, Systematic review of utilities.
The company used the disutilities estimated from the preference elicitation exercise to impute treatment￾specific utility values for stable disease for the two treatments, after applying the weighted average
method based on AE rates discussed in Chapter 6, Systematic review of utilities. The same progressive
disease utility value was applied to both treatment arms. The average severity of events experienced with
everolimus was marginally larger than that experienced with sunitinib (i.e. 0.647 vs. 0.656).
Some of the utility values for stable disease with AEs were based on assumption. These values are
presented in Table 66. The assumption adopted by the company that hypertension, which was not
measured in the preference elicitation study, had an average disutility equal to the average utility for all
AEs in stable disease (0.128, = 0.771 – 0.643) is particularly implausible as national EQ-5D data in large
samples suggest that the disutility of hypertension in patients with cancer in the last 5 years is negligible.182
The disutility of anaemia, which was imputed in the same way as for hypertension, is higher than the
0.085 identified in previous reviews of chemotherapy-induced anaemia.183 Likewise, the imputation of the
0.128 disutility value for all AEs for grade 3/4 fatigue by Novartis is questionable in view of lower time
trade-off estimates found in previous studies.183,184
No disutility for end-of-life care costs was included in the analysis nor was any adjustment for the effect
of age on background utility considered. The overall mean utility values after including treatment-specific
AE profiles and the utility value for progressive disease used in the company’s analysis are presented in
Table 67.
Costs Novartis included the costs of drug acquisition and administration (for first and subsequent
treatments and treatments defined as BSC), disease monitoring, management of treatment-related
grade 3/4 AEs and death.

The acquisition cost of everolimus of £2673.00 for 30 tablets of 10 mg adopted in the model was based
on 2016 BNF prices.36 The company presented analyses with and without a (confidential information has
been removed) PAS discount, which reduced the drug acquisition cost to (confidential information has
been removed). The cost of everolimus in each (monthly) cycle was calculated as the product of the
monthly cost of everolimus acquisition and administration, that is, a dispensing fee, and the proportion of
patients on treatment at each cycle in the everolimus arm of RADIANT-3,34 in which everolimus treatment
was given for a median duration of 8.61 months and a mean duration of (confidential information has
been removed). The cost of everolimus was adjusted by the RDI of 85.9% recorded in RADIANT-3,34 which
accounted for everolimus treatment interruptions and dose reductions.
The acquisition cost of sunitinib was £2522.40 for 30 tablets of 37.5 mg, based on 2016 BNF prices.36 The
company assumed a PAS discount whereby sunitinib is given free of charge to the NHS for the first cycle,
as is the case in Scotland, and adjusted costs by a RDI of 91.3%, as reported for sunitinib in A6181111.81

In its base-case analysis, Novartis assumed that the cost of sunitinib acquisition and dispending was
incurred for the same number of mean treatment cycles as for everolimus, on the basis that its ITC found
no difference in PFS duration between the two treatments. This assumption seems untenable in the light
of the available data on treatment duration from A618111181 and RADIANT-3.34 The company performed
a sensitivity analysis using an alternative figure of 9.66 months for sunitinib treatment duration, which the
company attributed to the literature without providing a reference. It also cites a submission by Pfizer to
the AWMSG in which Pfizer is reported to have assumed that ‘patients receive an average of 293 days of
treatment per year’.
179 However, in its submission to NICE, Pfizer reported an average duration of sunitinib
treatment of 8.3 months in clinical practice (253 days; Pfizer submission, p. 1732). In addition, the median
treatment duration for sunitinib in A618111181 was 4.64 months as opposed to the (confidential
information has been removed) of everolimus use in RADIANT-3.34
The cost of drug administration involved a dispensing fee to cover a hospital pharmacist’s time required to
dispense an oral medication, obtained from the Personal Social Services Research Unit,142 and the cost of
delivering chemotherapies for intravenously administered drugs, obtained from NHS reference costs.141
The same administration cost was thus applied to everolimus and sunitinib.
As for the costs of monitoring treatment and disease, data on 13 advanced pNETs (six well differentiated
and seven moderately differentiated) patients, as provided by a survey of 34 UK clinicians, as part of a
survey of 197 clinicians in six countries with experience of treating advanced NETs, were used in the
company model. The main publication113 reporting the methods and findings of the survey is included in
the systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies (see Appendix 10, Results). The survey asked clinicians
about the treatment received by and health-care resources used for the two most recent patients they
had treated, for each of three disease stages: a baseline period, a first progression period and a second
progression period. The baseline period was described in the survey as the period following diagnosis with
advanced pNETs, up to the first time that tumour progression was recorded. The first progression period
followed the baseline period and ended when the patient was diagnosed with further measurable disease
progression of advanced pNETs.
For the purposes of deriving data for its economic analysis, Novartis considered the first progression phase
as the stable disease phase of the model and the second progression phase as the progressive disease
phase of the model. The survey produced actual resource utilisation data for eight (60%) pNETs patients
in the stable disease phase and no patients in the progressive disease phase. Because of limited data
available on NETs in general in the progressive disease phase, the survey asked clinicians to provide
hypothetical data on the 13 pNET patients. The majority of patients (n = 7; 54%) were in the 51–65 years
age range and had an ECOG PS of 0–1 (n = 6; 46% – n = 4 had no recorded status).
Data were collected on resource use, including clinician visits, procedures and tests (e.g. CT scans,
biomarker tests, including chromogranin A, and other tests) and hospitalisations. In addition, data on
symptomatic (SSA and other) drug use in stable disease and symptomatic treatment and chemotherapy in
progressive disease were collected. The clinicians were asked to estimate the duration spent in stable
disease for patients, whereas for progressive disease they were asked to assume that patients would spend
12 months in that state. By dividing the reported amount of resource use for the whole stable disease and
progressive disease periods by their respective duration, the average cost of a monthly cycle was derived
for use in the model. As more clinician visits were obtained for the first cycle of the progressive disease
phase, the Novartis model allowed for different health-care costs in the first and subsequent cycles after
progression. Unit costs were obtained from NHS reference costs.141
The resulting values used for populating the model are presented in Table 68, which is reproduced from
the Novartis submission.33 In total, 84% of the total health-care costs in stable disease (£87; physician visits
plus tests plus hospitalisations) are associated with physician visits (£55 per month) and CT scans (£18
per month). The progressive disease state for the first month after disease progression generates total
health-care costs of £376 (first cycle), with a cost of £170 per month subsequently; the difference is due to

0.4 additional visits to the primary physician and one additional visit to other physicians in the first month
after progression. In subsequent months of the progressive disease state, 95% of the costs are incurred
from physician visits (£106 per month), CT scans (£22 per month) and hospitalisations (£34 per month).
The costs of managing AEs covered treatment-related grade 3/4 AEs that occurred in the stable disease
phase of the model. Only AEs that were recorded in > 2% of patients in any of the active treatment arms
of A618111181 and RADIANT-334 were accounted for. Details of the AE types, the methods used for
deriving the AE probability estimates for the sunitinib arm, involving the Bucher indirect comparison
analysis in Chapter 4 (see Indirect treatment comparison: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours), and the
duration for which AEs were measured in the model are described in Appendix 14 and Chapter 6 (see
Utility values for the Peninsula Technology Assessment Group model). As described in Chapter 6, the AE
probabilities were based on the assumption that the rates of individual types of AEs were constituted by
single events per patient in each trial arm; this was a consequence of Novartis not having access to
individual patient data from the A618111181 trial sponsored by Pfizer.
Moreover, as described earlier in the utility section, the Bucher indirect comparison produced sunitinib AE
rates whose aggregate magnitude was smaller than the respective magnitude in the everolimus arm in
RADIANT-3,34 whereas the opposite occurred when the count of different AEs was combined to derive an
overall AE rate for sunitinib using the same Bucher method. This led Novartis to calculate the disutility and
cost of a typical AE as a weighted average of the costs of the different AEs multiplied by the relative
contribution to the overall sum of AE rates for each treatment arm in the model. The inputs into this
weighted average are presented in Table 69. In line with the weighted average disutility of AEs used in
the Novartis model, the cost of a typical AE in the everolimus arm is more expensive, by 15%, than the
average cost of an AE under sunitinib treatment. Novartis estimated an overall AE OR of 4.47 for sunitinib
compared with everolimus, but the data on AEs with sunitinib in the A618111181 trial that the company

used were obtained from previous publications and, for certain AE types, differed from those reported by
Pfizer in its submission to NICE; with the updated figures, the AG obtained a OR estimate of 1.37 instead.
Based on the monthly (confidential information has been removed) probability of AEs with everolimus
estimated by Novartis from RADIANT-334 individual patient data, which the company applied for the first 25
cycles of the stable disease model under everolimus (with a probability of 0 applied for subsequent cycles),
the Bucher OR estimated by Novartis produced a monthly probability of AEs with sunitinib of 26% in those
cycles; with the OR calculated by the AG, the monthly probability of AEs with sunitinib changes to 10%.
This means that the costs of the additional risks of an AE with sunitinib are partly offset by the lower
severity of these AEs relative to everolimus. Moreover, updating Novartis’s data on AEs with sunitinib with
data submitted by Pfizer32 to NICE reduces the additional costs of AEs with sunitinib. These additional costs
decline over time as fewer people in both arms remain in the stable disease state. Furthermore, in the base
case they decline at the same rate in both arms, as Novartis assumed that PFS is the same across the two
arms, until cycle 25 (at 2 years after treatment starts), after which no AE costs are incurred.
The use of symptomatic treatment, defined as SSA, in the stable disease phase was estimated from the
proportion, 37.7%, of people who received the treatment before progression in the everolimus arm of
RADIANT-334 and the Bucher indirect comparison OR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.478 to 2.262) estimated for
everolimus compared with sunitinib (Novartis submission, section 4.7.2.3;33 see earlier in this appendix).
This resulted in a SSA treatment rate with sunitinib of 36.8%, which was multiplied by the monthly cost of
treatment with SSAs, as detailed in Table 70. The costs used by Novartis were based on BNF drug acquisition
prices.36 In contrast, average drug acquisition prices paid by hospitals, as recorded in the electronic market
information tool (eMIT) database,137 are 8–26% lower for the symptomatic treatments considered by
Novartis (final column of Table 70). As for symptomatic treatment in progressive disease, a rate of SSA use
of 25% was assumed based on the results of the health-care resource use survey of UK experts113 described
earlier, 1.9 administrations of octreotide per cycle, at a mean daily dose of 30 µg for the first 15 days and
450 µg thereafter, and 90% RDI.
The costs of subsequent treatments following disease progression were included for chemotherapy, radiotherapy
and chemoembolisation. Information on subsequent therapy used in the sunitinib arm of A618111181 was
not recorded in the trial (Pfizer, response to AG data request, August 2016). Novartis stated that the rates of
subsequent treatments used in its model were obtained from those recorded in the RADIANT-334 trial of
everolimus compared with placebo; these were applied to both the sunitinib and the everolimus arms of the
model. However, the rates used in the model (reproduced in Table 71) and those observed in RADIANT-334
and reported in the appendix of the Novartis submission33 do not seem to correspond.

End-of-life care costs were included as a single fixed amount of £4346 occurring at the time that patients
died in the model. This figure was obtained from a published study estimating the per-patient health-care
costs observed in the terminal phase of life of cancer patients in England and Wales,143 measured from
the time when strong opioids are used, and included the costs of elective and non-elective inpatient
hospitalisations, outpatient visits, AE attendances and visits to district nurses and GPs.
Costs were expressed in 2015 prices.
Gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
Efficacy, effectiveness and safety evidence
In RADIANT-4,35 205 patients were randomised to 10 mg daily of everolimus plus BSC and 97 were
randomised to placebo plus BSC. Randomisation was carried out with stratification by previous SSA use
(continuous SSA for ≥ 12 weeks), tumour origin [better-prognosis stratum: appendix, caecum, jejunum,
ileum, duodenum or NET of unknown primary origin; worse-prognosis stratum: lung, stomach, colon
(other than caecum) or rectum] and WHO PS (0 vs. 1). The median follow-up period in the study was
21 months and the median duration of treatment with everolimus was 40.4 weeks. Median PFS was
11.0 months (95% CI 9.2 to 13.3 months) in the everolimus arm and 3.9 months (95% CI 3.6 to
7.4 months) in the placebo arm. A 52% reduction in the estimated risk of progression or death was
observed in the everolimus arm (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67).
Participants in RADIANT-435 were not allowed to undergo treatment crossover after disease progression.
Interim OS analysis found a reduction in the risk of death with everolimus of 36% (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.40
to 1.05), but the data were not mature enough to estimate median OS in any arm. Grade 3/4 drug-related
AEs observed in the trial included stomatitis, diarrhoea, infections, anaemia, fatigue and hyperglycaemia
(see Chapter 4, Results for details).
Review of the economic models and their results in the submission
A systematic literature review was conducted by Novartis with the aim of identifying economic evaluations
related to the use of everolimus in the GI and lung NETs patient population and resource utilisation or
costing and utilities associated with health states or treatments in the GI/NETs patient population. No
studies were found.

and including PFS (cut-off date 28 November 2014) and OS (cut-off date 30 November 2015) data from
RADIANT-4.35 For this purpose and to extrapolate the OS and PFS outcome distributions beyond the end
of the follow-up period in RADIANT-4,35 a parametric survival curve was chosen from six parametric
distributions of time to event: exponential, Weibull, gamma, Gompertz, log-normal and log-logistic. Two
variants of each of these survival distributions were estimated: an unrestricted variant, in which one
distribution was estimated using data from both trial arms but different estimates for each parameter in
the distribution were obtained for the two arms, and a variant in which the data from both arms were
analysed with the same distribution but all but one of the parameters (i.e. the scale) were restricted to be
the same for the everolimus and placebo arms.
More broadly, Novartis assessed the empirical adequacy of three classes of treatment effect models for PFS
and OS data. One was the shifted failure time model, which assumes that treatment effects take place
by displacing the survival curve to the right by a constant amount at each percentile of the cumulative
survival distribution. The second model class is the proportional hazards model, which assumes that the
treatment proportionally alters the (instantaneous) risk of the event occurring; this model class includes the
exponential, Weibull and Gompertz models. The third model class considered was the AFT model, which
assumes that treatment affects the survival time proportionally; this model class includes the log-logistic,
log-normal and gamma models. By applying the counterfactual criteria of Bagust and Beale185 to model
section, Novartis was able to discriminate the AFT model class as providing valid PFS model candidates,
whereas the proportional hazards and AFT model classes were valid for modelling OS. The counterfactual
criteria consist of obtaining for each candidate model the (predicted) survival curve of the placebo arm that
would have occurred had the placebo patients been randomly allocated to the active treatment and
comparing it with the actual survival curve of the active treatment arm; valid models are those for which the
counterfactual placebo survival curve matches the survival curve of the active treatment arm.
Additional criteria were used to select survival distributions within model classes, including having a low
BIC statistic (goodness of fit), and plausibility of long-term extrapolation. The latter had two requirements.
One was having curves that were above the 15-year 5% survival rate, a criterion adopted by Novartis on
the survival rate evidence from the SEER database, despite the caveats acknowledged by the company and
discussed earlier with regard to the Novartis pNETs model. The other requirement was that curves did not
cross, which, in the analysis of OS, was justified on the basis that ‘there is no reason to believe that the
OS for everolimus plus BSC would be less than that for placebo plus BSC at any point in time’ (Novartis
submission, p. 13733).
The PFS model selected for the base case was the (restricted) log-normal model, whereas the (restricted)
gamma, (restricted) log-logistic and (unrestricted) log-normal models were used for sensitivity analyses.
The (restricted) log-logistic distribution was chosen to model OS in the base-case analysis, with the
(restricted and unrestricted) log-normal model used in sensitivity analysis. Novartis considered unrestricted
variants as more flexible options than the restricted forms of each survival distribution but in practice their
added flexibility ended up ruling them out as candidate models for PFS and OS data because of curve
crossing between the everolimus arm and the placebo arm. Therefore, it is questionable whether or not
the modelling approach adopted by Novartis may have imposed too straight a jacket by fitting a common
survival distribution function to PFS and OS data from both arms of RADIANT-4,35 given that the more
flexible (although potentially less efficient) modelling approach of separately modelling the data from each
trial arm was not considered.
Although patients in RADIANT-435 were not allowed to cross over from placebo to open-label everolimus
after disease progression, data on subsequent treatments submitted to NICE by Novartis as part of the
economic model (table 7.13, p. 15433) show that 9% of patients in RADIANT-4 received everolimus as
subsequent treatment after disease progression. It may be argued that, from the point of view of the NICE
decision problem, the approach adopted by Novartis of modelling and extrapolating OS outcomes without
adjustment for placebo crossover to everolimus (in spite of including, in the BSC arm of the model, the costs
of subsequent everolimus treatment used by placebo arm participants) in RADIANT-435 may be invalid.

Adverse events
The model included the costs of grade 3/4 AEs reported in RADIANT-435 that had an incidence of ≥ 2%.
This resulted in the inclusion of stomatitis, diarrhoea, fatigue, infections, peripheral oedema, anaemia,
pyrexia and hyperglycaemia. The proportions of participants experiencing these events were used to
calculate a weighted average cost of AEs for each of the two model arms, which was then multiplied by
the probability of any such AEs in each cycle. Using individual patient data from the trial, the average
AE rate per cycle was calculated to be 0.0625 from the first to the 26th cycle in the stable disease phase
for everolimus and 0.0147 from the first to the 30th cycle in the SD phase for BSC. Other cycles were
assigned AE probabilities of zero. Given that HRQoL outcomes that allowed derivation of health state
utilities were measured in RADIANT-4,35 these AE probabilities were not used to calculate base-case
utility values but they were used to calculate alternative utility values in sensitivity analysis following the
approach described earlier for pNETs (see Chapter 5, Economic evaluation of everolimus in pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumours).
Model implementation
In order to incorporate the costs of subsequent treatment, different costs were used in the model in the
first and in subsequent cycles after disease progression. The costs of drug administration were applied to
both initial and subsequent treatments. AE costs were applied only in the stable disease state. The costs of
terminal care were also included as a single cost as participants die in the model. Costs and QALYs were
discounted at a 3.5% annual rate.
Utility values
Health state utility values for stable disease and progressive disease were obtained from FACT-G outcome
data collected in RADIANT-4.35 This involved using the ordinary least squares mapping algorithm estimated
by Longworth et al.134 and Young et al.186 This served to meet the requirements of the NICE reference
case of using patient-reported HRQoL outcomes and valuing such outcomes using preferences from the
general public.37 The AG has been able to reproduce the utility estimates used in the base-case analysis
from publicly available summary data on FACT-G domain scores reported by RADIANT investigators74 and
a linearised version of the best-fitting non-linear algorithm, based on domain responses134 (see Chapter 6,
Systematic review of utilities). The base-case analysis used the value of 0.779 for stable disease and 0.725
for progressive disease in both treatment arms, although the company also estimated treatment-specific
stable disease utility values of 0.767 for everolimus plus BSC and 0.807 for placebo plus BSC and progressive
disease values of 0.714 and 0.747, respectively, and used these values in scenario analyses. The stated
reason for the choice of base-case values was that the differences in utilities between everolimus plus BSC
and placebo plus BSC in RADIANT-435 ‘were not statistically significant or clinically meaningful’ (Novartis
submission, p. 15933). As acknowledged by the company, the utility values for progressive disease are
unlikely to be valid measures of the post-progression period as they are based on HRQoL outcomes of a
subgroup of people who had progressed by the time that the study had ended and which covered only the
early phase of the progressive disease state. This led the company to explore lower values in sensitivity
analyses.
No adjustment was applied to utilities for end-of-life care or the effect of ageing on HRQoL.
Costs
The costs of drug acquisition, dispensation and administration associated with everolimus and BSC were
included in the analysis. Analyses of costs using list prices and alternative potential PAS discounts
were presented.
The cost of drug acquisition of 10 mg daily of everolimus, as given in RADIANT-4,35 was calculated using
the 2016 BNF price of £2673 for 30 tables of 10 mg each.36 Alternatively, the PAS discount of (confidential
information has been removed) was applied to the list price of everolimus. This, plus the cost of oral drug
administration, was multiplied by the proportion of patients remaining on everolimus at each cycle in the
stable disease health state, which was derived from a time-on-treatment curve calculated from individual

patient data from RADIANT-4.35 The Kaplan–Meier median treatment duration was (confidential
information has been removed) months and by month 38 (confidential information has been removed)
remained on treatment. A RDI obtained from RADIANT-435 data of 79.4% was applied to the everolimus
treatment costs.
The costs of orally administered treatment were based on hospital pharmacy staff time, with unit costs
obtained from the Personal Social Services Research Unit.142 The costs of intravenously administered
therapies as part of BSC were applied using unit costs obtained from NHS reference costs.141
Included in BSC were analgesics, antiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, external beam radiation therapy and SSAs,
based on the views of key opinion leaders consulted by Novartis to validate an earlier resource survey
of UK clinicians. The rates used in the model for each of these categories of BSC were derived from
RADIANT-435 data. Novartis selected the most commonly observed specific treatment as a representative
for each category for the purposes of calculating the costs of BSC in the model. The usage rates of
therapies constituting BSC used in the model are presented in Table 72.
Health-care resource use was estimated from a survey conducted in 2016 to validate the results of an
earlier 2011 survey of 32 UK clinicians in England, relative to current practice. The original survey findings
have been published for the combined GI and lung NETs location.120 The methods used in the survey are
described earlier for Novartis’s pNETs model. The validation exercise considered current management
practice in non-functional GI and lung NETs separately and involved five clinicians from four centres, two
of which were ENETS European centres of excellence. The results of the survey, by averaging the
responses of the five clinicians according to the annual number of GI and lung patients they treated
annually, are presented in Table 73, weighted in proportion to the mix of GI and lung participants in
RADIANT-4.35
The validation survey elicited the opinion from clinical experts that ‘patients on active treatment are more
likely to receive follow-up care to monitor disease progression and toxicity’ than patients receiving BSC

alone (Novartis submission, p. 15933). In addition, patients in the progressive disease state accrue costs
depending on whether they are receiving active post-progression treatment or are under observation
(32.7% of patients initially treated with everolimus and 33.3% of patients who started the model under
BSC alone were under observation; see details in Table 74).
Novartis stated that ‘Although the Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) did not indicate that there would be a
significant difference in how patients who had previously received everolimus plus BSC alone would be
treated after disease progression, the relative use of these post-progression therapies was calculated using
the RADIANT-435 trial data’ (Novartis submission,33 section 7.5.5.1). Costs for post-progression treatments in
the model were applied according to the number of treatment cycles that they were observed to be given for

in RADIANT-4,35 assuming standard dosages rounded to the nearest dose that was consistent with no
wastage (Table 77).
Octreotide LAR was applied a unit cost of £998.41 per month based on 2016 BNF prices.35 This price is
20% higher than the £806.42 average price available to hospitals according to the eMIT database137
(accessed October 2016). Another aspect to note is the rate of use of everolimus in the placebo arm of
9.3% compared with a rate of 4.3% in the everolimus arm, both of which were given for a treatment
duration of 6.18 cycles in the model (see Table 74). Clinical expert advice received by the AG suggests
that there is currently no access to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in England, although there was
previously, and that chemotherapy would be used instead in most patients.
A fixed cost of £4346 was applied when patients died in the model to account for the costs of terminal
care. This figure was derived from the literature.143
To estimate the costs of AEs, the probability of any AE, derived from the pooled incidence of grade 3/4
AEs with an incidence of ≥ 2% in either arm of RADIANT-435 (see Chapter 4, Outcomes from randomised
controlled trial evidence for gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours, Adverse events), was
multiplied by the weighted average cost of those specific AEs, according to the relative magnitude of each
AE type in the sum of all rates. The unit costs of specific AEs were obtained from NHS reference costs.141

Efficacy and effectiveness evidence
Advanced Accelerator Applications conducted a systematic review of studies providing evidence on the clinical
efficacy and safety of 177Lu-DOTATATE in patients with GEP NETs. Randomised and non-randomised studies
were included. Only one RCT145 was included in the review, NETTER-1, which compared 177Lu-DOTATATE plus
30 mg of octreotide with 60 mg of octreotide in individuals with GI NETs.
Advanced Accelerator Applications conducted two MTCs for the outcomes of PFS and OS: one for
pNETs comparing 177Lu-DOTATATE with everolimus and sunitinib and one for GI NETs to compare
177Lu-DOTATATE with everolimus. AAA considered the study and participant characteristics in all studies
in the two networks to be comparable, including RADIANT-2,190 which was excluded from our systematic
review (see Chapter 4) because all participants have functioning tumours, which is outside the licence for
everolimus. These MTCs are illustrated in Figures 35 and 36.

Advanced Accelerator Applications made three major assumptions in performing its MTC. These were that:
1. 60 mg of octreotide can be assumed to be equivalent to placebo and placebo plus 30 mg of octreotide
(in order to connect NETTER-1 to the other trials) in the GI NETs network
2. 60 mg of octreotide is equivalent to placebo and placebo plus BSC (in order to connect NETTER-1 to
the other trials) in the pNETs network
3. data from the NETTER-1 trial can be used to inform the network for pNETs even though no participants
within the NETTER-1 trial had pNETs.
Advanced Accelerator Applications undertook a Bayesian analysis with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulation in R. It ran fixed- and random-effects models with HRs as response variables, using the poisson/
log model and the binomial/cloglog model. AAA reported assessing convergence using trace plots,
autocorrelations and ‘other standard convergence diagnostics’ (AAA submission, p. 21031), but did not
state explicitly whether or not convergence was achieved in the models.
The results of the MTCs are shown in Tables 78 and 79.

We have a number of reservations regarding the MTCs conducted by AAA:
l RADIANT-2190 should be excluded from the MTC for GI NETs as the population in this trial all have
functioning tumours, which is outside the marketing licence for everolimus in GI NETs.
l NETTER-1 should be excluded from the pNETs network as this trial did not include any patients with pNETs
l For the evaluation of GI NETs, the populations included for OS differ across the three studies (midgut
NETs in NETTER-1, all NETs in RADIANT-2 and GI and lung-NETs in RADIANT-435).
l There is no justification for the assumption that 60 mg of octreotide LAR is equivalent to placebo,
placebo plus 30 mg of octreotide and placebo plus BSC.
l There is no consideration of the extent of treatment switching within RADIANT-2190 (58% switched to
active treatment), RADIANT-334 (73% switched to active treatment) and A618111181 (69% switched to
active treatment), which limits the interpretation of the results for OS.
l The 95% credibility intervals (CrIs) are very wide, indicating a great deal of uncertainty.
l Results from the random-effects Poisson model and the fixed- and random-effects binomial model are
not reported in the submission and so no comparison of any differences in point estimates or 95% CrIs
between these models can be made.
For the non-randomised evidence, AAA identified four single-arm non-RCTs,145,162–165,170 yet focused on the
Dutch subset of the ERASMUS study.162–164 This is a single-centre Phase I/II open-label study of Dutch
participants with GI NETs and pNETs (n = 810) administered 177Lu-DOTATATE. The primary outcomes of
ORR, median PFS and OS by location are shown in Table 80.

The electronic database search was supplemented by hand searching the Cost-effectiveness Analysis (CEA)
Registry, NICE HTA, PBAC (Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee) and CADTH (Canadian Agency
for Drugs and Technologies in Health) submissions and conference proceedings.
In total, 597 records were retrieved, and after deduplication 533 individual titles and abstracts were
screened; 16 records were retrieved for full review and 11 of these met the criteria for final inclusion.
Three were from the UK; 10 were cost-effectiveness analysis studies and one was a budget impact study.
All 11122,126,127,144,191–194 were assessed as being of good quality.

Seven cost-effectiveness analysis studies compared sunitinib and BSC with BSC; two compared octreotide and
BSC with BSC; one compared everolimus with chemotherapy; and one compared everolimus with sunitinib.
Nine papers evaluated people with pNETs, one evaluated those with carcinoid syndrome and VIPoma and
one evaluated GI (midgut) NETs.
The methodology used in the company’s systematic review of the economic literature was sound and
comprehensive. However, the company did not include a description of the results or discuss the strengths
or limitations of their review, nor were the findings of the included studies discussed alongside the findings
of the company’s original economic evaluations.
Data and methods
Efficacy and effectiveness data used in the model
Baseline rates of progression and OS were estimated using Weibull parametric extrapolations of
Kaplan–Meier curves from individual patient data, fitted using ordinary least squares regression methods.
The Weibull function was selected based on goodness of fit using the AIC and BIC, combined with clinical
plausibility on visual inspection.
A partitioned survival model was implemented in Microsoft Excel with Weibull coefficients for PFS and OS
generated in Stata® (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) for each comparator.
The pNETs evaluation used the progressive pNETs subgroup of the Dutch population of patients treated
with 177Lu-DOTATATE in the ERASMUS study for baseline risk (number at risk: PFS, n = 80; OS, n = 87;
median PFS 35.6 months; median OS 80.7 months).
The GI NETs evaluation used patients treated with octreotide LAR in the NETTER-1 study for baseline risk
(number at risk: PFS, n = 106; OS, n = 113; median PFS 8.4 months; median OS not reached).
Under an assumption of proportional hazards, HRs generated from the MTC were applied to the baseline
survival curves (Table 81). Background mortality was not included in the base-case analysis but was
included in scenario analysis.
Adverse events
Serious adverse events (grades 3 and 4) were incorporated into the model using incidence data from
clinical trials (Table 82). For each treatment an AE profile was developed whereby each event, when
appropriate, carried a cost of management and an associated utility decrement.
Treatment-specific adjustments to baseline PFS utility were calculated using decrements weighted
according to event incidence in the trials (Table 83).

Decrements for AEs were applied to every cycle for which patients remained progression free, including
post treatment for those patients administered 177Lu-DOTATATE.
The utility decrement weightings for SAEs followed the trend advised by the AG expert clinicians: BSC
> 177Lu-DOTATATE > everolimus > sunitinib. 177Lu-DOTATATE dose adjustment as a result of AEs or
missed treatments in NETTER-1 was incorporated into the costing of 177Lu-DOTATATE in the base case by
applying a RDI reduction in mean drug acquisition cost. No such adjustment was made for everolimus or
sunitinib. AE utility decrements were applied to all treatment strategies while patients were progression
free. As these decrements should be applied to the treatment period only, this approach overestimates the
period of disutility from AEs. Although the disutility penalty is greatest for everolimus and sunitinib, the
mean duration of treatment of 177Lu-DOTATAE is less than that of everolimus and sunitinib in practice.
In any case, the ICERs are insensitive to this limitation.

Utility values
A systematic literature search was conducted for relevant published HRQoL papers. Pragmatic searches
were conducted for HRQoL mapping algorithms and utility decrements for SAEs. HRQoL scores were
collected for stable and progressive disease in the base case from pNETs/GI NETs patients administered
177Lu-DOTATATE in the ERASMUS study (Table 84). However, the exception is the base-case estimate of
stable disease in GI NETs, for which the estimate was sourced from a UK registry. The company did not
explain why this approach was adopted.
Patients in the ERAMUS trial were Dutch and the number of participants and their characteristics were not
stated. Responses were collected every 12 weeks from first treatment to 72 weeks. HRQoL scores from the
EROTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire used in the ERASMUS trial were mapped to EQ-5D scores.134 HRQoL scores
from registry patients at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (UK) were attained directly using the
EQ-5D questionnaire (58 patients; 57% male; 94% white; mean age 60 years). Overall, the synthesis of
health state utility estimates is potentially weak because of the use of multiple sources, multiple quality-of￾life assessment tools and cohorts from single-arm studies/registries rather than RCTs.
Adverse events were not modelled using an additional health state; instead, disutilities were applied to
the baseline PFS estimates according to the incidence of AEs in the trial of each treatment (see Adverse
events). Utility decrements were estimated for 19 event types, although 12 of these were assumptions
based on the remaining seven for which sources were found. In nine cases the decrement was assumed to
be equal to the worst value, which was incorrectly selected as 0.11 (thrombocytopenia) rather than 0.2
(fatigue). No adjustment were applied to utility accrual in the base case for end-of-life well-being; this was
included in a univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis.
Costs
The included cost categories were drug acquisition, drug administration, disease monitoring and AE
management. No provision was made for any hospitalisation of patients owing to deterioration of their
condition. Patients with stable disease received continual drug treatment until the point of progression,
except for the 177Lu-DOTATATE strategy, whereby therapy was limited to four treatment cycles. All
patients received and incurred the cost of octreotide (30 mg) following progression and until death.
Drug acquisition prices and posology were sourced from the BNF36 (everolimus, sunitinib and octreotide),
except for 177Lu-DOTATATE, for which information was supplied by AAA (Table 85).
Drug prices were incorporated into the base case at the NHS list price; no discount or PAS prices were
explored in sensitivity analyses. A RDI adjustment to reflect downwards dose modifications or skipped
doses observed in the NETTER-1 trial (0.864) was applied to the acquisition cost of 177Lu-DOTATATE.
No equivalent adjustments were made for everolimus or sunitinib. This reduced the cost of the
177Lu-DOTATATE strategy, which decreased the ICERs compared with everolimus/sunitinib.
The cost of 177Lu-DOTATATE administration was based on 15 minutes of pharmacist time, 1 hour of day
ward nursing time and a 4-hour (one-third) day case attendance. This is inconsistent with the company’s
statement in chapter 2 of its submission in which the involvement of nuclear medicine department

resources are anticipated. It is also inconsistent with expert clinical opinion that we received, which
indicated that specialist involvement and admission with an overnight stay is routine.
Everolimus and sunitinib are self-administered orally and therefore attracted a zero administration cost.
The resource utilisation for monitoring of disease was assumed to be the same for all treatment strategies.
The unit costs are shown in Table 86.
Monitoring costs at baseline (screening) were not included because these costs are not influenced by
choice of treatment and apply to all patients.
The unit costs of treatment were included for 18 separate SAE types. Seven were dedicated estimates
taken from standard literature sources; eight were arbitrarily assigned a cost of £1, based on the
presumption that the event would have little impact on NHS resources; and three were assumed to be
equal to the cost of the highest cost event (stomatitis, £385.17). The cost of managing AEs was included
for every cycle in stable disease, rather than while on treatment. Note the earlier assumption that
everolimus and sunitinib treatment are continued until progression in all cases.
Additional costs relating to end-of-life care or palliative care were not included in the base-case analysis
but were included in univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis.
The price year used in the analysis was not stated but it may reasonably be assumed to be 2015.

Appendix 10 Review of cost-effectiveness
evidence
The purpose of this appendix is to review existing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of sunitinib,
everolimus and lutetium relative to chemotherapy or BSC in patients with unresectable or metastatic,
progressive NETs.
Methods
Searches
Bibliographic literature searching was conducted on 19 May 2016 and forward citation searching was
completed on 17 August 2016. The searches took the following form: (terms for neuroendocrine or
pancreatic or GI or lung) AND (metastatic or unresectable or advanced) AND (terms for the interventions
under review) AND (a costs or economic literature search filter). The searches were not date limited, were
not limited by language and were not limited to human-only studies.
The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), NHS EED (Wiley Online Library),
Web of Science (ISI – including conference proceedings) and EconLit (EBSCOhost). The search strategies
are recorded in Appendix 1.
Screening
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as for the clinical effectiveness systematic review
(see Chapter 4, Inclusion and exclusion criteria), with the following exceptions (as specified in the
appraisal protocol):
l non-randomised studies were included (e.g. decision model-based analyses or analyses of patient-level
cost and effectiveness data alongside observational studies)
l full cost-effectiveness analyses, cost–utility analyses and cost–benefit analyses were included (economic
evaluations that report only average cost-effectiveness ratios were included only if the incremental
ratios could be easily calculated from the published data)
l studies that measure only costs but not health benefits were excluded, except for stand-alone cost
analyses from the perspective of the UK NHS.
Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance by two reviewers (RMM and IT), with disagreements
resolved by discussion. Full texts were retrieved for references judged to be relevant and were screened for
eligibility by the same reviewers, with disagreements resolved by discussion.
The bibliographies of included studies and review articles, which were not judged to be eligible for
inclusion, were examined by one reviewer (RMM) to identify other potentially relevant references. These
references were retrieved and checked for eligibility in the same way as for full texts identified from the
database searches.
Quality assessment
Studies meeting the criteria for inclusion were assessed by one reviewer (RMM) using the checklist
developed by Evers et al.195 This checklist is intended as a criteria list for the quality assessment of
economic evaluations in systematic reviews, thereby making these reviews transparent, informative and
comparable. Studies based on decision models were further quality assessed using the checklist developed
by Philips et al.196

Synthesis
Economic studies were summarised and synthesised using tabulated data and narrative synthesis.
The narrative synthesis described the major contributions of reviewed studies to the economic evidence
on targeted treatments in patients with advanced, progressive NET and the methodological strengths and
weaknesses. The findings were summarised with reference to the elements of the NICE reference case.37
Results
Identified studies
The electronic database search for cost-effectiveness evidence identified 1143 records; six additional
records were identified by other means. After deduplication, 896 records remained, all of which were
screened by title and abstract. Of these, 30 full texts were assessed for eligibility. Eight of these were
deemed to meet the eligibility criteria for the review. The study selection process is detailed in Figure 37.
Four of the eight full texts were journal articles and the remaining four were posters presented at
conferences. Three120,121,123 of the four articles were full economic evaluations and were included in the
review. The remaining article197 was an analysis of the costs of administration of lanreotide and octreotide;
because of the limited scope of this study, and as the revision of the NICE scope removed these two
treatment options from the present technology assessment review, this study was excluded from the review.

Of the four identified conference poster presentations, one described the only study conducted in the UK122
and provided detailed methods and results and was therefore included in the review; another reported
limited methodological information and results and was conducted in the Portuguese health-care setting198
and was therefore excluded. The remaining two posters were evaluations of lanreotide and octreotide118,199
and were therefore excluded. Given the limited evidence found, and as no recent conference abstracts were
found that reported economic evaluations, update searches were not conducted.
The three included studies reported in peer-reviewed journal article form were evaluations of treatments
for pNETs. One study was an evaluation of sunitinib compared with everolimus in the US health-care
setting,120 one was an evaluation of sunitinib compared with BSC in the Mexican health-care system121 and
one was an evaluation of sunitinib compared with BSC in the Polish health-care system. The included study
presented as a conference poster was an evaluation of sunitinib compared with BSC for pNETs patients in
Scotland and Wales.122 One of the excluded posters was the only report found, in poster or journal article
form, that related to an economic evaluation of treatments for GI NETs.118
Table 88 describes the characteristics of the included studies. All studies were sponsored by the industry or
co-authored by an individual affiliated with a company manufacturing or commercialising one of the
evaluated treatments.
Pancreatic studies
Summary characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 89. The main results of these
studies are presented in Table 90. The critique of each of these studies is guided by the quality assessment
reported in Table 91.
Casciano et al.120
The only study comparing targeted therapies evaluated everolimus and sunitinib in patients with advanced
(unresectable or metastatic) progressive pNETs from a US health insurer perspective. In the absence of a
head-to-head study of the two treatments, this study was based on the results of a previous indirect
comparison of AE, PFS and OS outcomes with everolimus and sunitinib across their respective pivotal Phase III
trials.124 Data on outcomes with everolimus relative to placebo were those reported in RADIANT-3,34 whereas
the sunitinib outcomes were obtained from A6181111.81
The analysis modelled the experience of a cohort of patients who receive either everolimus plus BSC or
sunitinib plus BSC, from the start of treatment until 20 years post treatment. Patients were assumed to be
in an initial stable disease health state where they could remain until death or they experienced disease
progression and moved to a deteriorated health state, progressive disease, with higher costs and lower
utility values. In turn, those who experienced disease progression would, according to the model, remain
there until death. This model was implemented as a semi-Markov model in which patients could move
between the three health states (stable disease, progressive disease and death) at discrete time points
every month. In each of these monthly cycles patients would accumulate costs and utilities specific to the
health state; different costs and utilities were accumulated for stable disease between the two initial
treatments (sunitinib and everolimus), whereas costs and utilities for progressive disease and death were
the same under the two treatments (death incurred costs and utilities of zero). The study reported that
four health states were used; however, two of these were stable disease states that were differentiated
only by the presence or absence of AEs, which did not affect the transition probabilities to the other health
states (progressive disease and death) but only the costs and utilities associated with the cycle. As the rate
of AEs varied with each cycle, in effect this was a Markov model with three health states, with variable
costs and utility pay-offs for the stable disease state.
The transition probabilities across states with each successive cycle were derived by partitioning survival
into OS time and survival time free from disease progression. To estimate the PFS and OS curves for each
treatment, the MAIC method was used.124 In this application, this consisted of weighting individual patient
data from one placebo-controlled trial (i.e. RADIANT-334 trial of everolimus) to match the distribution of

summary baseline characteristics in the other trial (A618111181 trial of sunitinib, for which no individual
patient data were available to the analysts). The resulting weighted placebo-controlled HRs for PFS and OS
were applied to Weibull parametric curves of PFS and OS data from the everolimus arm of RADIANT-3.34
For AEs, cycle-specific event rates were derived from the observed grade 3/4 AE rates for each successive
cycle in the everolimus arm of RADIANT-3,34 scaled by the overall ratio of pre- to post-weighted rates of
grade 3/4 AEs with everolimus and the ratio of sunitinib event rates to MAIC-weighted everolimus rates.
Data on resource utilisation were obtained from a survey of physicians with experience in the treatment of
NETs in the USA, who were asked about the experiences of a total of 40 patients recently treated by
them.120 The survey differentiated between a baseline stable disease phase, the period following a first
disease progression and the period after a second progression. Data collected covered actual patient

management in the baseline and first post-progression periods, which were taken to reflect the stable
disease health state in the model (as the patient population was defined as having advanced, progressive
NETs), whereas the second progression period, which was assumed to correspond to the progressive
disease heath state of the model, was mostly based on hypothetical treatment scenarios.120
Drug acquisition costs for 10 mg/day of everolimus and 37.5 mg/day of sunitinib, which were given in
RADIANT-334 and A618111181 until disease progression or dose reduction or discontinuation because of
intolerance, were adjusted for dose intensities of 85.9% and 91.3% respectively. Other costs were related
to BSC, which included SSA, physician visits, imaging and laboratory tests, hospitalised treatment for grade
3/4 AEs, post-progression therapy and end-of-life care.
Health state utility values were obtained from a time trade-off preference elicitation study in heathy
individuals of health state descriptors (vignettes) constructed by physicians for the purpose of this
economic model evaluation. Values for stable disease and progressive disease were elicited as well as
disutilities of a selected number of AEs.131 This was used to calculate a stable disease utility value
constituted by an AE-free utility value common to both treatments from which a weighted average of
disutilities according to their AE profiles in RADIANT-334 and A618111181 was subtracted, as well as a
progressive disease utility value common to both treatment arms of the model.
Treatment with everolimus and sunitinib resulted in a mean PFS duration of 1.19 and 1.04 years, respectively
(0.15-year difference), and 3.30 and 2.85 life-years, respectively (0.45-year difference). Everolimus increased
the number of annually discounted (at 3%) QALYs relative to sunitinib by 0.304 and increased the discounted
(at 3%) health-care costs by US$12,673 (in 2014 prices, purchasing power-adjusted price £9276) per patient,
corresponding to a cost per QALY gained of US$41,702 (£30,524).
The results were most sensitive to the PFS HR, treatment dose intensity, costs of progressive disease and
AE costs. PSA revealed a 69% probability that the ICER for everolimus was < US$100,000 and that the
95% CI ellipsoid covered all four possible combinations of outcomes (i.e. everolimus: increased costs
and increased QALYs, decreased costs and increased QALYs, increased costs and decreased QALYs and
decreased costs and decreased QALYs). Therefore, the study was inconclusive, although the authors argue
that these results suggest that everolimus is cost-effective.
Critique
This study provided evidence on the costs and health benefits of choosing one of two targeted therapies
available to treat advanced, progressive pNETs. It provides a comprehensive account of uncertainty in
the available evidence, which emerges primarily from the fact that no direct head-to-head comparative
studies of the two treatments exist and that, given the rare nature of the disease and treatment practice
heterogeneity, standard methods of indirect comparison (e.g. Bucher et al.41) are likely to lead to biased
results. The results of this study thus suggest that any comparison between the two treatments is unlikely
to lead to conclusive results and that measurement of cost and utility differences is crucial for informing
treatment choice in this patient population.
The main limitation of this study is the omission of a BSC arm from the analysis. Another key limitation is
the source of utility data, which were derived from time trade-off valuations of health state vignettes
formulated by clinical experts as opposed to being derived from HRQoL measurements of patient-reported
outcomes. Although the authors may have felt justified in their chose of values by the fact that their
source of effectiveness data for everolimus, RADIANT-3,34 did not collect such HRQoL patient-reported
outcomes, they could have employed the HRQoL outcomes reported in the A618111181 trial of sunitinib,
with mapping algorithms used to derive EQ-5D values. Finally, the authors acknowledged the lack of
adequate resource utilisation data for progressive disease.

Muciño Ortega et al.121
A study in Mexico compared sunitinib plus BSC with BSC alone, using the data from A6181111.81 The
study used the same three-state Markov model structure as in the study by Casciano et al.120 but used a
2-week instead of a 4-week cycle length to model the costs and QALYs of each treatment over a 10-year
period. The study adopted the perspective of the Mexican public health insurance system covering people
with a current or past history of formal employment. At least one of the co-authors was affiliated to Pfizer,
the sponsor of sunitinib.
The effectiveness data to populate the model parameters were obtained from a time-to-event analysis
using Weibull parametric models of PFS and OS data in A6181111.81 The relative treatment effects of
sunitinib were estimated relative to these models as proportional hazards. AE rates in the model were
obtained from the same trial.
The analysis included the costs of drug acquisition and medical management, including specialist
consultations, laboratory and imaging tests, pain management and palliative care. The resource utilisation
data were obtained from a survey of 15 clinical oncologists from institutions located in four large cities in
the country. The unit costs were obtained from government procurement tariffs and public health insurer
institution costs of services at the tertiary level.
Health state utility values were obtained from analysis of data collected in A6181111,81 using the
EORTC QLQ-C30. Such data were mapped onto EQ-5D scores using the linear algorithm of McKenzie and
van der Pol.132 The mapped EQ-5D scores were then analysed in a linear mixed model with covariates for
treatment allocation, cycle number and baseline mapped EQ-5D value.
The study found that sunitinib plus BSC resulted in an extra 1.18 (discounted) life-years over BSC alone
and 0.70 extra (discounted) QALYs. Sunitinib plus BSC was also more expensive than BSC alone by
US$20,854 (£12,925) in 2011 prices (£13,410 reflated to 2015 prices; adjusted for purchasing power
parity £22,977). The corresponding incremental cost per QALY gained was US$29,808 (£18,475; £19,168
in 2015 prices; adjusted for purchasing power parity £32,842). The parameters that had the most
influence on these results, in order of importance, were routine medical management costs before
progression, the HR for PFS, the HR for OS, sunitinib acquisition costs, the utility of the post-progression
health state and routine medical management costs after disease progression.
Critique
This study’s main strengths are its clarity of reporting, in defining the population, intervention and
comparators and the institutional and medical practice context within which the treatments are given. The
study clearly presents the derivation of resource use and cost parameters associated with AEs reported in
A618111181 and heath state utility values from patients’ responses to a disease-specific (EORTC QLQ-C30)
tool mapped onto the EQ-5D.
The main limitation of the study is its analysis of OS, in which crossover to sunitinib in patients in the
placebo arm was not adjusted for. Crossover occurred in 69% of patients under placebo;122 as the relevant
comparison in this analysis is between a situation in which sunitinib is available and an alternative situation in
which it is not, the analysis is likely to underestimate life-year and QALY gains by sunitinib over BSC (provided
that sunitinib extends life and disease progression-free life). The study did not account for subsequent
treatments; this information was not collected in the trial [Pfizer (through NICE), October 2016, personal
communication].
Another limitation of this study is its reliance on the opinions of a panel of oncologists to obtain resource
use data on medical management, which turned out to be one of the most important sources of
uncertainty in the study. The study did not analyse the extent of structural uncertainty in the results; there
is no report of any testing of the proportional hazards assumptions on which the results rely heavily and no
sensitivity analysis was performed using different parametric functions to extrapolate OS and PFS.

It is an open question, therefore, whether or not the estimated extension of life free of disease and overall
life extension found by this study of 0.49 and 1.18 years, respectively, are robust to different parametric
assumptions about the distribution of time to such events.
In summary, this study provides evidence on the potential cost-effectiveness of sunitinib relative to BSC in
pNETs. However, the results on costs and, consequently, cost-effectiveness may be not generalisable to the
UK setting because of marked differences in the cost of medical staff inputs relative to drug acquisition
costs between Mexico and the UK. Nevertheless, the study provides valuable evidence on health state
utility values in pancreatic patients.
Johns et al.122
The only published cost-effectiveness analysis in the UK is a conference poster by Johns et al.122 presenting
the evidence submitted by Pfizer to the SMC in January 2011 and to the AWMSG in March 2011, which
resulted in a positive recommendation for the drug as treatment for advanced pNETs in Scotland and
Wales. This analysis used the most recent data at the time from the Phase III A618111181 trial of sunitinib
compared with placebo to model incremental costs and QALY gains using the same methods of Muciño
Ortega,121 but with the addition of an adjustment to OS outcomes in the placebo arm for the effect of
crossover to sunitinib in the blinded and extension phases of the study.
It was reported that adjustment of OS data for crossover using the RPSFT model resulted in a HR at the
latest cut-off date of 0.499 (95% CI 0.351 to 0.947), citing a conference abstract source.94 However, it
was reported that the cost-effectiveness analysis was based on an estimate of the RPSFT model HR of 0.24
(95% CI 0.08 to 1.07) based on an ‘intermediate data cut’ dated December 2009 and citing ‘Pfizer data
on file’.
122 This analysis used a proportional hazards model for both PFS and OS time-to-event analyses, in
which PFS was analysed using a Weibull parametric regression form with a binary covariate indicating the
randomly allocated treatment group and in which OS in the sunitinib arm was modelled using a Weibull
form and the placebo OS outcomes were obtained from applying the HR from the RPSFT to the Weibull
placebo distribution. However, the Weibull parameter values used to extrapolate PFS and OS rates in the
model were not reported.
It was reported that the probabilities of AEs and treatment discontinuation were obtained from
A6181111.81 Resource utilisation data for BSC and AE management, with only grade 3/4 events
considered, were obtained from UK clinical expert opinion, without citing any sources. Utilities were
obtained from mapping the EORTC QLQ-C30 patient data from A618111181 onto the EQ-5D using the
algorithm of McKenzie and van der Pol.132 It was reported that ‘the mean baseline utility value was 0.73
for the sunitinib plus BSC and placebo plus BSC arms’ and that the value of 0.60 used for the progressive
disease phase in both arms was the mean utility value measured during the last study cycle for patients
who experienced disease progression. The quoted statement is unclear about the role that the baseline
utility value played in the analysis, especially as it is utility values post baseline and before progression that
are relevant for estimating utility in the stable disease phase.
The study reported that treatment with sunitinib resulted in an increase in discounted PFS years,
discounted life-years and discounted QALYs by 0.53, 2.33 and 1.39, respectively, whereas it resulted in
incremental costs of £31,416 (in 2010 prices), almost two-thirds of which was the cost of acquisition of
sunitinib. The resulting ICER was £22,587 (£24,244 at 2015 prices). Besides the use of ITT values for the
OS HR as opposed to crossover-adjusted values, which was most influential, the parameters to which the
results were most sensitive included the post-progression utility, sunitinib acquisition cost and the PFS HR.
The authors stated that the results were robust to variations in assumptions about concomitant SSA use
and parametric forms used to extrapolate OS and PFS.
Critique
The limited information available on this study prevents an assessment of its quality. Indeed, it is not possible
to replicate the results with the information presented in the poster, because, for example, the Weibull

parameter values used to extrapolate the PFS and OS curves in the model were not reported. It is noteworthy
that this study adjusted placebo OS outcomes for crossover to sunitinib, although the reported choice of
data cut-off date appears to be different from the latest cut-off date. This study suggests that adjustment
for crossover from placebo to the targeted treatment in RCTs in this area may determine whether or not a
treatment is cost-effective.
On the other hand, the study suffers from the omission of everolimus as a competing treatment option.
The methods used to estimate utilities were not clearly presented, although results presented in the
tornado sensitivity analysis appear to imply that the authors followed the methods detailed in the study by
Muciño Ortega et al.121 In common with other studies, this analysis suffers from a lack of actual resource
use data, as it was based entirely on expert opinions. According to these results, the cost per QALY gained
for sunitinib may be between £20,000 and £30,000.
Walczak et al.123
The same study question was investigated from a Polish health payer’s perspective in a separate study by
Pfizer.123 Walczak et al.123 provided a detailed account of the use of systematic methods to search for
effectiveness evidence on sunitinib compared with BSC, following principles in the Cochrane Collaboration and
the Polish Agency for Health Technology Assessment. The search was conducted in March 2012. Only one
study, A6181111,81 met the inclusion criteria, which specified the reporting of effectiveness, safety and HRQoL
outcomes in a head-to-head parallel-group RCT of the two treatment options for advanced, progressive pNETs.
The Polish study adopted the same Markov and partitioned survival analysis method of modelling the
costs and health outcomes as in the analysis submitted to the SMC and the AWMSG in 2011 by Pfizer
and reported by Johns et al.122 In addition, as in the study by Johns et al.,
122 the Polish analysis adopted
the estimates of OS effectiveness based on an interim data cut-off date of 15 April 2009,81,84 with a HR
of 0.18 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.68), as opposed to the latest estimates available at the time, with a cut-off
date of June 2010,94 which resulted in a HR of 0.49 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.94) based on the RPSFT model.
The (inverse) HR was applied to extrapolated OS rates obtained from a parametric Weibull function fitted
to the sunitinib arm, to derive the placebo curves that would have occurred in the absence of crossover
(counterfactual placebo OS rates). The authors reported that a Weibull function with a binary treatment
indicator was fitted to the PFS data from A618111181 to extrapolate PFS rates in the two trial arms, and
ultimately partition OS time into stable disease and progressive disease, which equals the difference
between extrapolated OS and extrapolated PFS rates (i.e. mean time in progressive disease for sunitinib:
2.98 – 1.89 = 1.09 years, and for BSC: 0.54 – 0.49 = 0.05 years; see Table 9.). However, the authors reported
the parameter values in Table 92, which suggests that Weibull functions were fitted to each arm separately.
The costs of drug acquisition, drug administration, diagnosis and monitoring (including a CT scan every
2 months for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter until disease progression), SSA use, BSC,
grade 3/4 AE management and palliative care were measured. Sunitinib and SSA treatment costs were
measured using the median treatment duration, with treatment stopped because of AEs, disease
progression or death. Alternatively, treatment duration until disease progression was used in a scenario
analysis. A compliance rate of 91.3%, obtained from the main trial report,81 was used, with compliance
defined as the number of doses administered relative to the number of planned doses at 37.5 mg daily.
End-of-life care was also measured using the costs of hospice-at-home care for the last week of life.
The study found that treatment with sunitinib plus BSC produced an extra 0.98 QALYs and had an ICER
of €20,441 (£33,866 at purchasing power parity in 2005 prices) per QALY gained relative to BSC only.
The parameter to which the results were most sensitive was the duration of sunitinib use.
Critique
Walczak et al.123 documented a systematic search of the RCT literature comparing sunitinib with BSC,
which identified only one study, the Phase III A618111181 trial. The authors reported a detailed assessment
of the quality of this study and an account of the main findings.
APPENDIX 10

A strength of this study is its application of a method to adjust OS outcomes for crossover of patients in
the placebo arm to the targeted therapy arm in A6181111.81 However, the authors reported the use of an
estimate of OS effectiveness based on trial data from a cut-off date of 2009 when an updated 2010
estimate, which was less favourable to the targeted treatment, was available.
In common with other economic studies funded by Pfizer and reviewed here, this study omitted a relevant
comparator, everolimus. RADIANT-334 may have been identified by the systematic search had it been
designed to include such targeted therapy.
As with other studies in NETs, this evaluation suffered from its reliance on a Weibull function to
extrapolate PFS and OS outcomes beyond the end of the trial. For the OS analysis this methodological
choice may have been determined by the need to use a parametric extrapolating function that was
consistent with the proportional hazards assumption so that the available estimate of effectiveness, which
was in HR form, could be adopted in the analysis. For PFS however, no such justification existed, as there
was no crossover adjustment to deal with, and the authors should have provided at least a sensitivity
analysis of the parametric extrapolation functions used for each arm.
There was also inadequate reporting of model inputs for the duration of sunitinib treatment and of model
outputs in terms of life-years and mean PFS time.
Overall, this is the only complete report of an economic evaluation in Europe. However, given the different
country setting and relative prices, and the limitations of the report itself, the evidence provided by this
study is of limited value to guide decisions in a UK NHS context.
Gastrointestinal studies
The only study identified in the GI location evaluated lanreotide relative to octreotide,118 both of which are
outside the NICE scope for the current assessment. For the present purposes, it is relevant that this study
adopted the same three-state semi-Markov structure as the analyses in pNETs reviewed in the previous
sections, using a 3-year and lifetime time horizons. This study was presented in a conference poster format
and, given the limited information thus provided, was not subject to any formal critique.

Appendix 11 Subgroup and scenario analyses
Subgroup analyses
The AG did not consider any other subgroups from the NICE scope apart from patients with pancreatic,
GI and lung and GI (midgut) NETs.
Scenario analyses
A range of scenario analyses were conducted, including:
l For pNETs and GI and lung NETs, using PFS data based on local investigator assessment for everolimus
instead of the PFS data from central independent review used in the base case.
l For pNETs, using OS data from ITT analysis instead of the RPSFT-adjusted OS data used in the
base case.
l Using an alternative set of utility values presented in Chapter 6, Tables 21 and 22.
l Using an alternative set of OS and PFS curves, allowing for the parametric form of the best-fitting
survival functions to differ across arms in a given comparison: for pNETs, the parametric PFS curve
under everolimus and BSC alone was changed to the log-normal and log-logistic functions,
respectively, whereas OS under everolimus was altered to the log-normal function; for GI and lung
NETs, PFS under everolimus and BSC alone was changed to the log-normal function, whereas OS under
the two strategies was changed to the log-logistic function. All other model specifications remained as
in the base case.
l Limiting the analysis to PFS, in recognition of the uncertainty associated with OS outcomes in this
clinical area that arise from the immaturity of the OS data and crossover and active subsequent
treatment use.
l A scenario analysis including first-cycle drug acquisition costs, which were omitted in the base case.
l A scenario analysis for GI (midgut) and GI and lung NETs with different costs of disease monitoring
corresponding to the numbers of physician visits adopted in the Novartis model. These were larger
than our base-case values, which reflected the opinion of our clinical experts. We altered values to be
between 2 and 2.6 times the base-case value in stable disease and 1.5 times the base-case value in
progressive disease.
l Applying a 0% discount to costs and benefits.
Local assessment
When we changed the PFS data for everolimus from central review data to local investigator assessment
data reported in the main study publications, we found that in pNETs the ICER for everolimus increased by
£18 from the base-case value of £45,493 and that the ICER for sunitinib, which was affected indirectly
through the Bucher-type adjustment to its PFS, decreased from the base-case value of £20,717 to
£19,586. In GI and lung NETs the ICER changed from £44,557 to £44,252 (Table 93).

Intention-to-treat analysis for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
Using the ITT data from the A618111181 and RADIANT-334 trials of pNETs produced ICERs that were three
times as high for everolimus (reaching an ICER of £136,000) and twice as high for sunitinib (£37,000) as
their respective base-case values (Table 94). These changes reflect the influence of adjusting for the effects
on OS of crossover to the targeted treatment in the placebo arms of both trials, which occurred in 69% of
placebo arm participants in the sunitinib trial and 85% of participants in the everolimus trial.
Alternative set of utility values
Increasing the utility values for stable disease in pNETs by 0.09 and keeping the values in progressive
disease practically unchanged, to correspond to the values in Swinburn et al.,
200 reduced the ICER for
everolimus by 10% to £41,246, as expected given the larger quantity of life lived in stable disease under
the everolimus strategy than under the BSC-only strategy. Similarly, the ICER for sunitinib was reduced by
6% to £19,411 (Table 95).
Utility values for everolimus in GI and lung and GI (midgut) were increased by 0.01 in stable disease and
reduced by 0.01 in progressive disease, while simultaneously reducing the utilities in stable disease with
BSC alone by 0.03 and increasing utility in progressive disease under the BSC alone strategy by 0.02; for GI
(midgut) these changes were applied at the same time as utilities under lutetium were increased by 0.02 in
both disease states. These changes increased the ICERs of everolimus by 12% in GI and lung, and 7% in
GI (midgut), and decreased the ICER of lutetium by 7%.
Alternative set of overall survival and progression-free survival curves
When the parametric survival models for everolimus and BSC alone were changed from proportional hazards
to AFT forms, the ICER for sunitinib in pNETs remained more or less the same, whereas that for everolimus in
pNETs decreased by 33% to £28,098 (Table 96). In contrast, everolimus in GI and lung NETs became less
effective than BSC alone in terms of discounted QALYs, despite its larger life expectancy, that is, 7.11
compared with 6.84 years; this result is explained by the different periods of time over which quality of life
benefits take place, so that, when the discount rate is switched to 0%, everolimus becomes the strategy with
the highest number of QALYs (data not shown). Thus, the relative advantage of everolimus in terms of
health outcomes tends to occur after an earlier disadvantage. At the 3.5% annual discount rate, such an
advantage occurs too late in time and everolimus becomes inferior to BSC in GI and lung NETs.

Analysis limited to progression-free survival
Because of the inherent uncertainty in the OS data caused by treatment crossover from placebo to
targeted treatments and its immaturity in the GI and lung and GI (midgut) locations, alternative analyses
that limit the measurement of costs and benefits until disease progression provide a good robustness test
of our results. In this scenario, the ICER for sunitinib in pNETs increased by 75% to £35,448, whereas the
ICER for everolimus in pNETs increased by 26% to £57,493 (Table 97). In GI and lung NETs, the ICER for
everolimus increased from its base-case value of £44,557 to £73,086. Everolimus has an ICER in patients
with midgut NETs that is 21% larger than that in GI and lung NETs, suggesting less value for money in
this patient subgroup and higher cost-effectiveness in the non-midgut GI and lung NETs population.
Furthermore, the ICER for 177Lu-DOTATATE is less than half that for everolimus at £30,115, which
suggests that peptide receptor radionuclide therapy treatment may have better longer-term outcomes
than everolimus.
Background mortality adjustments to the overall survival and progression-free
survival curves
Adjusting for background mortality has a limited effect on the results in pNETs and GI and lung NETs.
In GI (midgut) NETs, the ICER for everolimus declines from about £200,000 in the base case to £78,330
with background mortality adjustment (Table 98). This reflects the high degree of uncertainty in the
extrapolation of survival outcomes in the GI (midgut) location, for which we did have access to OS but had

to impute it from the available PFS data for this subgroup. In addition, in GI (midgut) NETs, the base-case
analysis that includes 177-Lu-DOTATATE adopts a background mortality adjustment because of the
immaturity of the OS data in NETTER-1, from which the effectiveness data for 177Lu-DOTATATE is derived.
Thus, in Table 98 we present the ICER for this treatment without adjusting for background mortality,
which reduces its ICER from £62,158 to £43,348.
First-cycle costs and disease monitoring
Accounting for first-cycle costs of subsequent treatments and disease monitoring intensity in GI and lung
and GI (midgut) NETs has a minor effect on the results, as evidenced by results in Tables 99 and 100.
Scenario analysis with a 0% discount rate
As evidenced previously by the results of the scenario analysis in which the parametric survival curves were
altered to more optimistic forms, the discount rate has an influential effect on the results as treatments
tend to yield significant benefits in the long term. This may be seen for both pNETs and GI and lung NETs
in Table 101.

Appendix 13 Progression-free survival and
overall survival: extrapolation of 177Lu-DOTATATE
outcomes in the NETTER-1 trial
177Lu-DOTATATE in the NETTER-1 trial (Advanced Accelerator
Applications submission to the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence)
Progression-free survival
Although the models did not differ in their goodness of fit to the PFS outcomes of 177Lu-DOTATE in
NETTER-1 (Figure 52), the Weibull model exhibited the closest fit to its associated risk of death or disease
progression (see Figure 50). The exponential fell in the middle of the range of PFS rates of the
candidate distributions.
The parameter of the PFS distribution was adjusted for the difference in expected PFS between the 60 mg of
octreotide arm of NETTER-1 and the placebo arm of RADIANT-435 (midgut population), following the method
described earlier for the analysis of pNETs (see Chapter 6, Model parameters). This indirect comparative analysis
implicitly assumes that these two arms would be expected to produce the same PFS and OS outcomes and are
thus subject to the reservations discussed in Chapter 6. Restricting the mean area under the Kaplan–Meier
curve of the placebo arm in RADIANT-435 to the maximum length of follow-up of OS in the 60 mg of octreotide
arm in NETTER-1 (which had a shorter follow-up than RADIANT-435), that is, 25.18 months, led to a restricted
mean PFS of 9.97 months in the placebo arm of RADIANT-435 and 13.23 months in the 60 mg of octreotide
arm in NETTER-1. In terms of Equation 1, the adjusted hazard and exponential survival functions with

The OS curve of the 177Lu-DOTATE arm of NETTER-1 adopted for the base case on the basis of the
diagnostic results was the exponential (see Table 23). The parametric OS curve of 177Lu-DOTATE was
adjusted for the 9.1%-shorter expected OS in the 60 mg of octreotide arm of NETTER-1 than in the
placebo arm of RADIANT-435 (midgut population), using the methods described above for pNETs (see
Chapter 6, Model parameters).
Overall survival
The 15-year OS rate with 177Lu-DOTATATE with the exponential distribution is 22%. After adjusting for
the differences in the control arms of NETTER-1 and RADIANT-435 (midgut only), this rate becomes 25%.
In contrast, the respective unadjusted rate for the Weibull function (Figure 53) is 3%. In any case, the
available OS data from NETTER-1 is extremely immature, making the comparison of 177Lu-DOTATATE with
everolimus very uncertain.

All three of the manufacturers – AAA, Novartis and Pfizer – submitted clinical evidence for consideration
for this MTA.
Advanced Accelerator Applications
Advanced Accelerator Applications conducted a systematic literature review to ‘identify all studies that
provide information on the clinical efficacy and safety of 177Lu-DOTATATE and relevant comparators
in the treatment of patients with inoperable GEP-NETs’ (AAA submission to NICE,31 p.18). The literature
searching carried out for this submission was sufficient, as were the inclusion/exclusion criteria used for
screening. It is unclear whether or not title and abstract screening was completed in duplicate. Full-text
screening was completed by two reviewers. As part of the inclusion criteria [table 16 of the AAA submission
(p. 58)], AAA included SSAs (octreotide and lanreotide). SSAs were removed from the NICE scope on 18
August 2016. In its submission, AAA stated that conference abstracts were excluded (company submission,
table 16, p. 58). It is unclear, therefore, why AAA included the NETTER-1 trial as, at the time, not only was it
published only in abstract form (and so it would not be identified by AAA’s systematic review) but also its
comparator was outside the NICE scope. AAA included non-RCT evidence in addition to RCT evidence for all
interventions and comparators (everolimus, sunitinib, octreotide, chemotherapy, lanreotide, interferon and
177Lu-DOTATATE). The AG did not find any RCT evidence for 177Lu-DOTATATE (as NETTER-1 was
excluded; see Chapter 4, Studies identified). The AG conducted a non-systematic review for non-RCT
evidence for 177Lu-DOTATATE and identified 32 studies (see Appendix 2, Results for non-randomised
controlled trial evidence). AAA identified four non-RCTs of 177Lu-DOTATE.145,162–165,170 All four non-RCTs
were included. It is unclear why AAA did not include the additional 28 studies that the AG had identified.
Network meta-analysis
Advanced Accelerator Applications did not undertake a meta-analysis as it found only one trial of
177Lu-DOTATATE. Instead, it performed an ITC for GI NETs, comparing everolimus with 177Lu-DOTATATE,
and a MTC for pNETs, comparing everolimus, sunitinib and 177Lu-DOTATATE, for the outcomes of PFS
and OS.
Five trials identified in the systematic review were excluded from the analyses by AAA for the following
reasons: 96% of participants at baseline had stable disease (CLARINET),176 no data were provided on the
number of participants with stable/progressive disease (PROMID)201 or the trials could not be connected to
either the GI NETs or the pNETs network.202–204
The three trials used in the ITC for GI NETs were RADIANT-2,190 RADIANT-435 and NETTER-131 (Figure 54).
The three trials used in the MTC for pNETs were RADIANT-3,34 A618111181 and NETTER-131 (Figure 55).

Study and participant characteristics were compared across studies by AAA for GI NETs and pNETs. For
somatostatin receptor status, AAA stated that in NETTER-1 all participants were SSTR+, but reported that it
was unable to obtain this information for RADIANT-2, RADIANT-3,34 RADIANT-435 and A6181111.81 It was
therefore assumed by AAA that the relative effectiveness between treatments does not alter according to
somatostatin receptor status. As we do not know the somatostatin receptor status of participants in the
other trials, we cannot be sure whether or not this assumption is correct.
For GI NETs, AAA highlighted that the tumour functioning status differs between participants in the
RADIANT-2, RADIANT-435 and NETTER-1 trials. It stated that tumour function is not reported in RADIANT-2,
that all participants in RADIANT-4 had non-functioning tumours and that, in NETTER-1, participants with
functioning and non-functioning tumours were eligible. Based on a lack of evidence to suggest a difference
in the relative effectiveness of everolimus and 177Lu-DOTATATE for participants with functioning and
non-functioning tumours, AAA assumed that there is no difference. AAA stated that the participant
populations from RADIANT-2, RADIANT-435 and NETTER-1 are aligned with each other and with the NICE
scope in terms of disease progression. AAA noted that, although all patients in RADIANT-4 and NETTER-1
had received prior therapy, it was unclear whether or not this was the case in RADIANT-2. From expert
clinical opinion, the AG notes that the prognosis for a patient differs depending on his or her tumour
functioning status. As we do not know the different proportions or participants with functioning and
non-functioning tumours in the different trials, we cannot be sure whether or not AAA’s assumption is
correct regarding the relative effectiveness of everolimus and 177Lu-DOTATATE for participants with
functioning and non-functioning tumours.

Advanced Accelerator Applications detailed the data used in the networks from each trial by NET location.
For GI NETs, the company considered the populations to be in close alignment for PFS but commented
that there are differences in the populations for OS (Table 102).
For pNETs, AAA reported that, although NETTER-1 and A618111181 included participants with functioning
and non-functioning tumours, RADIANT-334 did not report the tumour functioning status of their
participants. As for GI NETs, AAA therefore assumed that the relative effectiveness of everolimus compared
with 177Lu-DOTATATE does not differ by tumour functioning status. AAA stated that the participant
populations in NETTER-1, RADIANT-334 and A618111181 had progressive disease, which was assumed to
be aligned with the NICE scope. AAA noted that, although all patients in NETTER-1 had received prior
therapy, it was unclear whether this was the case in RADIANT-334 and A6181111.81
Advanced Accelerator Applications considered tumour location for RADIANT-334 and A618111181 to be
aligned for PFS and OS, but that the population from NETTER-1 (GI NETs) was not aligned. Nevertheless,
AAA included the GI NETs population from NETTER-1 in its MTC for pNETs (Table 103).
For both tumour locations, AAA noted that there was ‘considerable variation’ in the baseline characteristics
across trials, yet considered the trials to be similar enough to synthesise the data.
Advanced Accelerator Applications made three major assumptions in performing their MTC: (1) that 60 mg
of octreotide can be assumed to be equivalent to placebo and placebo plus 30 mg of octreotide (to
connect the NETTER-1 trial to the other trials in the GI NETs network), (2) that 60 mg of octreotide is
equivalent to placebo and placebo plus BSC (to connect the NETTER-1 trial to the other trials in the pNETs
network) and (3) that data from the NETTER-1 trial can be used to inform the network for pNETs even
though no participants in the NETTER-1 trial had pNETs. The third assumption is clearly untenable based
on the difference in typical expected survival outcomes in pNETs and GI (midgut) NETs.
Advanced Accelerator Applications undertook a Bayesian analysis with MCMC simulation in R for both
analyses using methods set out in Dias et al.205 They ran fixed- and random-effects models using the Poisson/
log model and the binomial/cloglog model. Prior distributions intended to be vague were used. A difference
of > 5 for the deviance information criterion (DIC) was used to identify the most appropriate model of the
four types run: fixed-effects Poisson/log model, random-effects Poisson/log model, fixed-effects binomial/
cloglog model and random-effects binomial/cloglog model. For each analysis, AAA report simulating four
MCMC chains, with a burn-in of 10,000 iterations. Results were based on 50,000 iterations and a thin rate of
4. AAA report assessing convergence using trace plots, autocorrelations and ‘other standard convergence

diagnostics’ (AAA submission, p. 21031), but do not state explicitly whether or not convergence was achieved
in the models. Consistency of the networks could not be assessed as there were no closed loops, meaning
that direct evidence for treatments compared within a RCT could not be compared with indirect evidence for
that treatment comparison.
Advanced Accelerator Applications reported very little difference between the DICs from the four models
for each network [table 27 (p. 83) of the AAA submission31); therefore, the results from the random-effects
Poisson model are presented for both tumour locations and outcomes. Point estimates and 95% CrIs are
reported for all treatment comparisons in tables 23–26 (pp. 81–82) of the submission.31 The main results
are summarised in Tables 104 and 105.
Limitations of Advanced Accelerator Applications’s mixed treatment comparison
We acknowledge the following important limitations of the MTC conducted by AAA, which limit the
extent to which the findings can be relied on: (1) RADIANT-2 should be excluded from this MTA as the
population in this trial all have functioning tumours, which is outside the marketing licence for everolimus
for GI NETs, (2) NETTER-1 should be excluded from the pNETs network as it does not include any patients
with pNETs, (3) for the evaluation of GI NETs, the populations differ across the three studies for OS
(midgut NETs in NETTER-1, all NETs in RADIANT-2, GI and lung NETs in RADIANT-4), (4) there is no
justification for the assumption that 60 mg of octreotide LAR is equivalent to placebo, placebo plus 30 mg
of octreotide and placebo plus BSC, (5) there is no consideration of the extent of treatment switching
within RADIANT-2 (58% switched to active treatment), RADIANT-3 (73% switched to active treatment)
and A6181111 (69% switched to active treatment), which limits the interpretation of the results for OS,
(6) the 95% CrIs are very wide, indicating a great deal of uncertainty, more so than the results from the

RCTs suggest and (7) the results from the random-effects Poisson model and the fixed- and random-effects
binomial model are not reported in the submission and so no comparison of any differences in point
estimates or 95% CrIs between these models can be made.
Comparison with the Assessment Group’s indirect treatment comparison
For GI NETs, RADIANT-2 was excluded from the AG’s analysis as everolimus is not licensed for functioning
tumours in GI and lung NETs and all participants in RADIANT-2 have functioning tumours. The AG did
not identify any trials comparing placebo plus BSC with 60 mg of octreotide to allow RADIANT-435 and
NETTER-1 to be linked in a network. In consultation with clinical experts, and in the absence of evidence to
suggest otherwise, the AG did not think that it was appropriate to link the RADIANT-435 and NETTER-1 trials
by assuming that placebo plus BSC (as used in RADIANT-435) is equivalent to 60 mg of octreotide (as used in
NETTER-1). However, in a sensitivity analysis, the AG made the strong assumption that placebo plus BSC can
be considered equivalent to 60 mg of octreotide, but this ITC should be interpreted with caution.
From data requests sent by the AG to AAA, the AG was able to obtain GI-only NETs data from RADIANT-435
(rather than GI plus lung NETS data, as used in AAA’s ITC), but only for PFS and some AEs. Therefore,
the results of the ITC undertaken by the AG are different from those of the ITC undertaken by AAA, as
RADIANT-2 was excluded from the AG analysis, only GI NETs data were included from RADIANT-435 and an
ITC for OS was not conducted by the AG as these data were not received from the company.
For PFS, the HR for 177Lu-DOTATATE compared with everolimus was estimated as 0.37 (95% CI 0.19 to
0.69) by the AG and 0.43 (95% CrI 0.05 to 4.24) by AAA. The 95% CrI in AAA’s analysis is wide because
a random-effects model was used. These findings are similar in magnitude; however, to accept these
results it must be assumed that placebo plus BSC is equivalent to 60 mg of octreotide. The AG also
conducted an indirect comparison of AEs, OS and RR.
For the pNETs network, the AG did not include data from NETTER-1 as none of the participants in this
trial had pNETs. Therefore, only data from RADIANT-334 and A618111181 were included in the AG’s ITC
between everolimus and sunitinib. As well as PFS and OS, the AG also reported ITC results for RR and
AEs. AAA considered only PFS and OS. For the comparison of everolimus with sunitinib for pNETs, point
estimates calculated from AAA’s MTC for PFS and OS are the same as those from the AG’s indirect
comparison; however, the 95% CrIs from AAA’s analysis are much wider than the 95% CIs from the
AG’s analysis. For example, the PFS HR for everolimus compared with sunitinib from AAA’s analysis is
(confidential information has been removed), whereas the HR from the AG’s analysis is 0.83 (95% CI 0.49
to 1.42). It is likely that these differences in the widths of the 95% CrI and 95% CI occur because AAA
reported the results from a random-effects model, whereas the analysis conducted by the AG assumed a
fixed-effects model. As AAA did not report the results from a fixed-effects model it is not possible to check
whether or not this is the reason for the uncertainty.
Novartis
Novartis conducted a systematic review aiming to identify ‘all relevant RCT and non-RCTs investigating
everolimus, sunitinib or 177Lu-DOTATATE for the treatment of patients with advanced, metastatic or
inoperable pNETs, and 177Lu-DOTATATE for advanced, metastatic or unresectable GEP-NETs’ (Novartis
submission, p. 3333). The literature searching carried out for this submission was sufficient, although there
were minor errors in one of the searches of The Cochrane Library. It is unlikely that any studies were
excluded from the review because of this error. The review followed the CRD’s Guidance for Undertaking
Reviews in Health Care.
38 The methods used by Novartis are described in brief and are adequate for the
purpose of the submission. To minimise the risk of bias, it would have been preferable for two reviewers
to have reviewed all titles and abstracts, rather than one reviewer screening them all and the second
reviewer screening 10% and all included citations.

In relation to pNETs, Novartis identified five RCTs and 41 non-RCTs. Of the five RCTs, four evaluated
everolimus (RADIANT-3,34 COOPERATE-2 (COmbination Of Pasireotide and evERolimus in Advanced Tumors
of neuroEndocrine origin, second trial),206 Yao et al.,
107 NCT01628913207) and one evaluated sunitinib
(A618111181). Of the four RCTs that evaluated everolimus, only RADIANT-334 was included in the submission
as COOPERATE-2 and NCT01628913 compared everolimus with comparators outside the scope. The results
from the fourth identified RCT, that by Yao et al.,
107 were retracted by the authors 6 months after their
publication.208 The inclusion of RADIANT-334 matches the RCT included by the AG for the assessment of
everolimus in pNETs. RADIANT-334 is reported in detail in the main text of the company submission, with
additional information presented in appendix 3 of the submission.33 Novartis also refers to OBLIQUE, a
currently unpublished Phase IV observational study, which assesses quality of life in individuals with pNETs
receiving everolimus. Novartis also reports on non-RCTs of everolimus, which represent 16 or 17 [16 studies
referred to in the main company submission document, whereas 17 studies are presented in the results
table (see appendix 2 of the company submission33)] of the 41 identified non-RCTs. The non-RCT data were
tabulated (see appendix 2 of the company submission33) and summarised in the main report (see chapter 4.8
of the company submission33). The AG did not assess any non-randomised evidence for everolimus. Novartis
conducted two further systematic literature reviews aiming to identify ‘relevant clinical evidence on the
efficacy and safety of everolimus for the treatment of GI NETs (SLR1) and lung NETs (SLR2) respectively’
(Novartis submission, p. 5933). The literature searching carried out was sufficient and the methods of the
review were the same as those mentioned earlier. In terms of the GI NETs systematic review, eight RCTs and
five non-RCTs were identified by Novartis, of which three RCTs and two non-RCTs also met the eligibility
criteria for inclusion in the lung NETs systematic review. Of the eight RCTs and five non-RCTs, only one RCT
and one non-RCT were deemed relevant by Novartis in its submission (RADIANT-435 and Bajetta et al.209
respectively). Irrelevant RCTs were excluded based on the interventions not meeting the inclusion criteria in
the scope (Yao et al.;
210 CLARINET;211 Faiss et al.;
201 Jacobsen et al.212 PROMID;176,213 Wolin et al.214) or the
population recruited not being within the marketing authorisation for everolimus (RADIANT-2119,215–217).
Irrelevant non-RCTs were all excluded based on the interventions not being within the scope (Ferolla et al.,
218
Campana et al.,
219 Grozinsky-Glasberg et al.220 and Panzuto et al.221). The AG did not include non-RCTs for
everolimus. Consequently, from the two included studies from Novartis, the AG also identified RADIANT-435
(the RCT) but did not include Bajetta et al.209 (the non-RCT). RADIANT-435 is reported in detail in the main text
of the company submission, with additional information presented in Appendix 7 of the submission.
Network meta-analysis
Novartis did not conduct a meta-analysis, MTC or ITC for GI and/or lung NETs as it identified only the
RADIANT-435 trial.
For pNETs, Novartis identified three trials in its systematic review that included everolimus (RADIANT-3,34
COOPERATE-2206 and NCT01628913207), stating that, because of the different comparators in these three
trials, a meta-analysis was not undertaken. Instead, an indirect comparison between everolimus and
sunitinib was carried out using RADIANT-334 and A6181111.81 The network for Novartis’s pNETs MTC is
shown in Figure 56.
The network was used to compare PFS, OS, concomitant SSA use and 13 grade 3/4 AEs (for which there
was an incidence of ≥ 2% in either trial) between everolimus and sunitinib. For PFS, Novartis conducted

two indirect comparisons, one using PFS defined by local review and a second using PFS defined by a
central blinded investigator review (referred to as BIRC in its submission). For OS, Novartis conducted an
indirect comparison of OS based on ITT analysis and an indirect comparison of OS based on the RPSFT
method, to account for treatment switching at disease progression that occurred in both trials.
A comparison of the study and participant characteristics between RADIANT-334 and A618111181 was
conducted by Novartis, who deemed the trials to be similar enough to be combined. The outcomes from
both trials contributing to the ITCs are presented in table 4.8 of Novartis’s submission.33
Novartis also reported the results of a published MAIC,124 which used individual participant data from
RADIANT-334 and aggregate data from A6181111.81 This method was used to allow for matching of the
characteristics of participants in RADIANT-334 with those in A618111181 and to help address the issue of
approximately 70% of participants switching from the control arm to the active treatment arm in both
trials after disease progression. However, Novartis argued (p. 49 of the submission33) that the limitations of
the MAIC method, which include the inability to match on characteristics not accounted for in both trials,
the unknown impact of unobserved differences in study and/or patient characteristics and the fact that the
SMC, for which the MAIC had been included in a health technology assessment that it appraised on this
clinical question, referred to the MAIC as ‘non-standard’, have led it to consider the more straightforward
approach of Bucher et al.41 for carrying out an indirect comparison between everolimus and sunitinib.
Using the MAIC method partially corrects for some of the bias associated with comparing two different
populations from the two trials, whereas there are no corrections for patient population differences in the
Bucher et al.41 method. In any case, the MAIC analysis serves as a robustness check of the Bucher results.
The results of these analyses are summarised in Tables 106 and 107 (see tables 4.11–4.15 in Novartis’s
submission33 for all data used and the MTC results).
Novartis concluded that there are no significant differences in (locally and centrally defined) PFS, (ITT or
RPSFT) OS and concomitant SSA use between everolimus and sunitinib. It reported that the indirect
comparison for AEs suggests a higher odds of grade 3/4 neutropenia, hypertension, palmar–plantar
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome and leukopenia events with sunitinib than with everolimus, whereas for the
remaining AEs a higher odds is associated with everolimus than with sunitinib. However, none of the ORs
is statistically significant and all have very wide 95% CIs.
Limitations of Novartis’s indirect treatment comparison
The AG notes the following limitations with the indirect comparison carried out by Novartis: (1) it is unclear
where Novartis obtained the HR for blinded independent review-defined PFS for A618111181 as the AG
was unable to identify this from the published literature and (2) the justification for using the Bucher
et al.41 method of indirect comparison is not clear when a MAIC analysis would have been possible.

The AG notes that the conclusions of the published MAIC124 are similar to those reported by Novartis using
the Bucher et al.41 method, even though the methods used differ and the OS data used by Novartis are
more mature than those used in the published MAIC analysis.
Comparison with the Assessment Group’s indirect treatment comparison
The AG identified the same two RCTs for pNETs and used the same method for the ITC41 as Novartis.
The ITC results were exactly the same for local investigator-defined PFS between Novartis and the AG and
were very slightly different for blinded independent review-defined PFS, even though the HRs and 95% CIs
for RADIANT-334 and A618111181 were the same. The AG believes that this very slight difference is possibly
related to Novartis using more precise data than the AG had access to. For OS, the AG used data for
A618111181 from Pfizer’s submission32 rather than data from Raymond et al.,
81 which is what Novartis used.
Therefore, there are some differences in the HRs and 95% CIs used between the AG and Novartis. However,
both sets of results (the AG and Novartis) for PFS and OS indicate no statistically significant difference between
everolimus and sunitinib. Similarly, the ITCs for grade 3/4 AEs from the AG and Novartis all show very wide
95% CIs, suggesting that there is no statistically significant difference between everolimus and sunitinib.
Pfizer
Pfizer did not conduct a systematic review to identify relevant trials for this decision problem as it was
confident that the only trial conducted with sunitinib in its licensed indication for pNETs was the
A618111181 trial. This matches the identification of A6181111 by the AG as the only relevant trial for the
analysis of sunitinib. Pfizer reported data primarily from the principal study publication.81 In addition, other
data sources for the A618111181 trial included the CSR110 (dated 2009) and updated survival analysis from

Critique of the matched adjusted indirect comparison analyses by Pfizer
Pfizer presented a MAIC of everolimus and sunitinib using placebo-controlled treatment effects on PFS and
OS from the A6181111 trial81 of sunitinib compared with placebo and the RADIANT-3 trial34 of everolimus
compared with placebo. These analyses follow previously published work by Signorovitch et al.,
124 who first
applied the MAIC method to this question. Pfizer used updated OS data and matched the sunitinib and
placebo arms of A618111181 to the baseline characteristics in RADIANT-3.34 The direction of matching,
that is, of the A618111181 population to the RADIANT-334 population, was determined by the availability
of individual patient data from the former trial and only summary data from the latter trial. In contrast, the
study by Signorovitch et al.124 was sponsored by Novartis and had available individual patient data from
RADIANT-334 but only aggregate data from A6181111,81 which determined that matching was performed
in the opposite direction, that is, from RADIANT-334 to the A618111181 population.
Briefly, a MAIC involves estimating sampling weights by regression analysis and applying these weights to
data from individual patients to adjust their relative contribution to the analysis of outcome data from the
‘index’ trial, that is, A6181111;81 the weights reflect the likelihood that an individual with a mix of baseline
characteristics is found in the population of a ‘target’ trial, that is, RADIANT-3.34 In practice, logistic
regression is used to obtain the weights, following the methodology of propensity score matching for
observational data.222 As a result, the weighted summary characteristics at baseline match the baseline
characteristics of the target population in RADIANT-3.34 In the present case, in which no individual patient
data but only summary baseline characteristics are available for the target population, a modified approach
using the method of moments was used by Pfizer to obtain the matching weights.124
Pfizer’s justification for its use of MAIC, as opposed to simpler methods such as that by Bucher et al.,
to indirectly compare sunitinib with everolimus is that simpler indirect methods based on a common
comparator or anchor may fail to account for confounding when the populations of the trials in the
network differ markedly or trial designs or implementation vary. The company acknowledges, however,
that its MAIC analysis could not adjust for differences in study design across trials. The main justification
offered by the company for its MAIC, however, is in relation to the effect on crossover in OS. As 69% and
85% of placebo patients in A618111181 and RADIANT–3,34 respectively, crossed over to the active
treatment in open-label extension-phase studies, the OS outcomes in the placebo arm are ‘contaminated’
by the active treatments and would not serve as a common comparator or anchor. In contrast, by
matching the sunitinib arm of A618111181 to the everolimus arm of RADIANT-3,34 the MAIC is feasible.
Although the two RCTs investigated patient populations with progressive, advanced, well- or moderately
differentiated pNETs, important differences were noted between them. These included the early termination of
A618111 because of improved PFS with sunitinib, the smaller size of this trial relative to RADIANT-334 and the
more frequent imaging schedule in A618111181 (8 weeks vs. 12 weeks in RADIANT-334), which may result in
earlier detection of disease progression. Unlike A6181111,81 RADIANT-334 included patients with a PS of 2, but
as they constituted only 3% of the trial sample this had a limited effect on the results produced by Pfizer.
Although randomisation produced a balanced distribution of baseline characteristics in RADIANT-3,34 it
(confidential information has been removed).
Two approaches were taken by Pfizer to the MAIC, one for PFS and another for OS. For PFS, for which a
common BSC plus placebo comparator was available in both trials, the ‘comparator-based’ approach was
followed, involving the following steps:
1. The sunitinib and BSC plus placebo arms of A618111181 were separately matched to the everolimus arm.
2. The HR for sunitinib compared with BSC plus placebo was estimated from the matched A618111181
individual patient data.
3. A Bucher indirect comparison of everolimus with sunitinib was estimated using the HR from the
matched sunitinib compared with BSC plus placebo data from A618111181 and the reported HR for
everolimus compared with BSC plus placebo in RADIANT-3.34

The 95% CI for the resulting MAIC HR for PFS was calculated from the standard errors of the log HR of
sunitinib compared with BSC plus placebo, adjusted for the effective sample size, and of the HR of
everolimus compared with BSC plus placebo in RADIANT-3,34 as approximated from its reported point
estimate and 95% CI (confidential information has been removed).
Because of contamination as a result of crossover, the MAIC for OS was conducted by directly matching
the sunitinib arm to the everolimus arm. In this analysis, the following steps were followed:
1. The sunitinib arm of A61811114581 was matched to the everolimus arm.
2. The individual patient OS data for everolimus were recreated from digitised Kaplan–Meier curves using
the algorithm of Hoyle and Henley.223
3. The HR for sunitinib compared with everolimus was estimated from the matched individual patient data
from the sunitinib arm and the recreated individual patient data in RADIANT-3.34
The weights applied to the sunitinib arm for MAIC with everolimus were normalised (i.e. divided) by the
effective sample size (defined as the ratio of the square of the sum of weights to the sum of the square of
individual weights). The purpose of this adjustment was that the 95% CI associated with the hazard ratio
in step 3 accounted for the reduced amount of information available from a sample of a given size
after matching.

Confidential information has been removed. In particular, Pfizer compared the matching-adjusted
Kaplan–Meier curve of the placebo arm in A618111181 with the respective curve from recreated individual
patient data from the placebo arm of RADIANT-334 and (confidential information has been removed).
However, given the differences in the timing of scheduled imaging assessments to determine disease
status between the two trials, discussed in Critique of the matched adjusted indirect comparison analyses
by Pfizer, adjusting for the placebo PFS outcomes in the common comparator approach seems warranted
nonetheless.
In relation to its OS results, Pfizer acknowledged the limitation of the data available. In particular, the
available sample for the sunitinib arm was small, especially after matching, which effectively halved its size.
Confidential information has been removed.
Pfizer provided a clear justification for the MAIC evidence submitted to NICE. This was based on updating
the previous analysis124 with new OS data and on methodological improvements on the previous work
by adding more variables on which to match the two indirectly compared trials. The first argument is
unquestionable given that final OS analyses have been published since the previous MAIC study. The
second argument is, however, less firm, as discussed below.
The analysis by Pfizer provides a clear description and adequate details of the methods used in and results
obtained from the MAIC. The discussion also acknowledges the main strengths and limitations of this
analysis and provides an adequate explanation of the reasons for the (confidential information has been
removed). This discussion provided the valuable insight that much of the (confidential information has
been removed). This highlights the limitations associated with the small sample size in this trial.
The AG notes that MAICs in small samples have a difficult balance to strike between internally valid
comparisons and generalisability to the relevant patient populations. We have discussed this issue before.224
The estimates of relative effectiveness for sunitinib derived from this indirect comparative assessment by
Pfizer may be relevant to a small group of patients, those who are represented in both A618111181 and
RADIANT-3,34 but may not be generalisable to the subgroup of patients not represented in RADIANT-334 but
present in A6181111.81 Thus, although Pfizer presents its findings as improved evidence with regard to the
previous study by Novartis on the basis of its use of additional variables for matching the samples from the
two trials, any additional variable used for matching reduces the generalisability of the MIAC findings to the
original A618111181 population. This is in addition to the limitations from increased sampling uncertainty,
which, as Pfizer notes, increases as the effective sample size declines with increased variables on which
to match.
As Pfizer acknowledges, the MAIC of OS between sunitinib and everolimus is affected by high levels of
uncertainty because of the lack of a within-trial placebo control for indirect comparison and the problems of
sample size. A further MAIC analysis is needed with a within-trial placebo control that is itself adjusted for
crossover to active treatment. Because of the small sample size in A6181111,81 the most fruitful approach
would be to match the sample of RADIANT-334 to the population of A6181111,81 as Signorovitch et al.124
have done, rather than the other way around, which Pfizer has done. This would produce estimates of
relative effectiveness with lower levels of uncertainty and risk of bias as a result of few observations.
Pfizer provided individual patient data on A618111181 to NICE, which the AG used to conduct some
sensitivity analyses of its MAIC. Confidential information has been removed.

Appendix 15 Methods for systematic reviewing
of utilities (health-related quality-of-life data)
Asystematic review was conducted to identify, appraise and synthesise all available data on HRQoL
of NETs patients, with the objective of estimating utility values for populating the ‘de novo’ PenTAG
cost-effectiveness model.
Identification of studies
The systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), School of Health and Related
Research Health Utilities Database (ScHARRHUD) [see www.scharrhud.org (accessed 15 May 2018)], the
Health Economics Research Centre (HERC) database, the EQ-5D website [URL: https://euroqol.org (accessed
16 July 2018)], the ‘patient-reported outcome and quality of life instruments’ database225 and the Health
Technology Assessment database and NHS EED. These searches were not limited by study design and
language. A complete list of search strategies can be found in Appendix 1.
All references were exported into EndNote X7 where automatic and manual deduplication was performed.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Studies identified by the searches were screened for inclusion according to the criteria listed below. Abstracts
were included conditional on their good reporting of the methods used and the outcomes obtained.
The population of interest consisted of patients with progressive, unresectable or metastatic NETs,
irrespective of the tumour location. The following outcome was considered: HRQoL of health states
relating to patients with progressive, unresectable and/or metastatic NETs. No exclusion criteria relating
to the intervention, comparator or study design were used.
Screening
First, one researcher screened for inclusion on the titles and abstracts returned by the search strategy. All
included records were then independently screened by a second researcher. Disagreements were resolved
by discussion. Full texts of identified studies were obtained and screened in the same way.
Data extraction
Data extraction from included studies consisted of details of the study’s design and methodology,
characteristics of the study population, the measure used to capture HRQoL outcomes, details on the
outcomes measured, the time horizon of the study and the type of statistical analysis undertaken by the
authors. Data were extracted by one reviewer (SL) and checked independently by a second reviewer
(RMM). Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Critical appraisal strategy
The quality of all studies included in the review was assessed by one reviewer. Owing to the lack of a
standardised checklist for the quality appraisal of HRQoL studies, a set of criteria was formulated to
critically appraise the studies included in the systematic review. The checklist used (Table 109) relies heavily
on the 14-item checklist designed by Mols et al.226 for the appraisal of quality-of-life studies in the area of
breast cancer and later used by Cornish et al.227 in the area of cutaneous melanoma. Compared with the
original version outlined in Mols et al.,
226 three items were added and one was deleted in order to adapt
the checklist to this specific disease area and types of studies. This version better captures the quality of
HRQoL studies included in this review. Some changes in the formulation of a number of items were also
made to clarify ambiguous language. Finally, the quality of reporting of two published economic
evaluations included in this review was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation
Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist.228
Mapping
Mapping was performed to obtain utility values from the EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-G data identified in
the literature review.
Mapping the EORTC QLQ-C30 to the EuroQol-5 Dimensions
Doble and Lorgelly229 conducted a comprehensive external validation study on the algorithms developed to
map EORTC QLQ-C30 scores to the EuroQol-5 Dimensions three-level version (EQ-5D-3L). The data set that
they used consisted of EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D values from a sample of 988 patients enrolled in the
Cancer 2015 longitudinal study.230 The patients involved were treatment naive and had been diagnosed
with a variety of cancers. Different stages of disease were accounted for by dividing the patient sample
into three groups according to disease severity and time to first follow-up.
Most mapping algorithms, particularly those relying on the ordinary least squares model and dummy
variables, were found to perform inadequately.229 Specifically, when tested using different tumour-specific
samples, predictive accuracy was found to be higher, on average, in healthier patient samples and lower in
patient samples with poorer health, corresponding to lower EQ-5D utility values. In general, the analysis
concluded that most algorithms seemed to be insensitive to tumour location but very sensitive to disease
severity. The algorithm by Versteegh et al.231 and that by Longworth et al.134 proved to perform particularly
well on a range of different validation criteria, including the ability to predict extreme EORTC QLQ-C30
health states and make predictions consistent with the country-specific EQ-5D tariff range. Moreover, such
algorithms showed a relatively small mean squared error when predicting EQ-5D values and corresponding
QALYs.229 Although the algorithm in Versteegh et al.231 cannot be generalised easily as it can only provide
utilities drawn from the Dutch value set, the algorithm developed by Longworth et al.132 (see Appendix 22),
although being computationally intensive, had the advantage of providing utility values for any country￾specific tariff, making it more generalisable.
The algorithm developed by McKenzie and van der Pol,132 although not found to provide the highest
accuracy in the review of algorithms by Doble and Lorgelly,229 has been widely used and cited in studies of
cancer. The validation process showed that the McKenzie and van der Pol132 algorithm performs well in
terms of predictive power, as all of the actual EQ-5D values were found to be in the 95% CIs of the
mapped values. Even more importantly, the difference in QALYs between treatment arms calculated using
mapped utilities was almost identical to the difference in QALYs calculated with the original EQ-5D utilities
(–0.019 vs. –0.017 QALYs). Nonetheless, questions relating to the generalisability of such results remain
unanswered, particularly in relation to the application of this algorithm to patient groups with widely
different age ranges and health status from those in the oesophageal cancer patient group used to
validate the algorithm.

As the impact of using different algorithms in cost–utility analysis could not be measured by Doble and
Lorgelly,229 and a number of limitations in their analysis prevented the identification of a preferred
algorithm beyond doubt, the authors recommend conducting sensitivity and scenario analysis to illustrate
the impact of choosing different algorithms and corresponding sets of mapped utilities.
Mapping the FACT-G to the EuroQol-5 Dimensions
The mapping of FACT-G scores to EQ-5D utilities was performed based on the work by Longworth
et al.,
134 who considered a wide range of models and tested their ability to predict EQ-5D utilities based
on FACT-G values. In particular, models that employed item-level data were found to perform better than
those using significant domain and total score models. The methods used to evaluate the algorithms
presented in Longworth et al.134 show that the best-fitting algorithm (see Appendix 22) used in this
analysis achieves a high degree of accuracy in predicting EQ-5D values. Nevertheless, Young et al.186 raise
concerns regarding the generalisability of such results on the grounds that the patient sample used to test
the algorithms in Longworth et al.134 included a surprisingly low number of patients in poor health.
In this analysis, the best-fitting algorithm by Longworth et al.134 (see Appendix 22) was linearised and used
to map published FACT-G summary domain scores into EQ-5D values for the stable disease and disease
progression health states for patients in RADIANT-4.35 These utility values were the only empirical data
available on EQ-5D health state utilities in patients treated with everolimus and, as we did not have access
to the original individual patient data from the RADIANT-435 trial to replicate the analyses by Novartis, we
validated their analyses by mapping published mean scores for FACT-G domains with linear Taylor series
approximations to Longworth et al.’s134 best-fitting algorithm. FACT-G scores mapped using the linearised
algorithm were then compared with published EQ-5D utilities obtained from the corresponding FACT-G
individual patient data mapped with Longworth et al.’s134 non-linear, best-fitting algorithm (see Appendix 22).
Results
A total of 6792 records were identified. After deduplication, 5192 records were manually screened by two
reviewers. After the screening process, eight studies were ultimately included in this review.32,73,121,123,131,232–234
A modified PRISMA flow chart is provided in Figure 57.
The main characteristics of the studies identified through the systematic search for data on HRQoL are
summarised in Tables 109 and 110.
Evidence identified through the systematic search for studies on health-related
quality of life
Of the included studies, data extraction on an initial set of six studies was undertaken (Table 110).
Of the six studies, one was a conference abstract on a longitudinal study;232 one was a Phase III expanded￾access study;233 one was a prospective cohort study;234 one was a preference elicitation study;131 and two
were economic evaluations.121,123
Evidence obtained by contacting the authors or the sponsors of the studies
A second set of studies was identified in the systematic search for studies on HRQoL as abstracts only, with
the study outcomes not available to the public. To obtain such data, the authors or the sponsors of the
studies had to be contacted directly. Table 111 summarises the main characteristics of the studies included:
a conference poster reporting HRQoL outcomes and some details on the methods used in a major clinical
trial78 and a CSR provided by the sponsor of the study as part of the NICE appraisal process.32

Appendix 16 Use of chemotherapy
The analysis by Novartis in patients with pNETs adopted the values for the use of chemotherapy after
disease progression presented in Table 112. The corresponding values for the company’s evaluation of
targeted therapy in GI or lung NETs are presented in Table 113. These values were used by the AG in the
respective the novo model analyses. The frequency of use of other supportive drug therapies in the AG
model-based analysis of GI and lung were obtained from RADIANT-4 data reported in the NICE submission
by Novartis, as presented in Table 114. The frequencies of AEs in the AG analysis of pNETs, GI and lung
and GI midgut patients, respectively, are presented in Tables 115–117.

Appendix 17 Addendum 1
Lung neuroendocrine tumours
The comparison between treatment with everolimus and treatment with BSC for lung NETs patients
yielded an ICER of £31,016 (Table 118). Treatment of these patients with everolimus results in better
survival (5.12 years vs. 2.96 for BSC). Likewise, the treatment costs in the everolimus arm are higher, driven
by the drug acquisition costs in the pre-progression health state (Table 119).
It must be noted that these analyses were derived using:
l mean treatment durations from exponential extrapolations of median treatment durations reported for
the lung subgroup in the CSR appendices provided by Novartis138
l exponential curves fitted to individual patient data derived from OS Kaplan–Meier curves and number
of patients at risk data provided by Novartis for the lung subgroup of RADIANT-435
l exponential curves fitted to individual patient data derived from lung PFS Kaplan–Meier curves
presented in the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) poster by Singh et al.73 [from PFS curves
for all, non-prior treatment with SSA and prior treatment with SSA subgroups in RADIANT-435 and
validated by comparing the resulting HR of 0.48 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.85) with the lung HR of 0.50
(95% CI 0.28 to 0.88) reported in the RADIANT-435 CSR]
l all other parameters were assumed to be the same as for the GI/lung patient population in
RADIANT-4.35
Alternative set of utility values
When an alternative set of utility values was applied the ICER for sunitinib was £19,411 and for everolimus
plus BSC was £41,246. In other locations the ICERs were > £30,000 (Table 120).
Analysis limited to progression-free survival
When the analysis was limited to accounting for costs and benefits up to disease progression, in patients
with GI (midgut) tumours 177Lu-DOTATATE had an ICER of £30,115 and everolimus had an ICER of
£88,801. In other tumour locations targeted treatments had ICERs of ≥ £35,448 (Table 121).
Background mortality adjustments to the overall survival and progression-free
survival curves
Background mortality adjustment resulted in an ICER for sunitinib of £21,594. In all other locations
targeted treatments resulted in ICERs of ≥£33,908 (Table 122) (the results for 177Lu-DOTATATE are
presented in Table 122 without adjustment for background mortality as the respective base-case values
included an adjustment for background mortality).

First-cycle costs and disease monitoring
When the costs of treatment after disease progression were included (accounted for by adjusting the
first-cycle costs of the progressive disease phase), the ICER for sunitinib plus BSC was £20,624 and for
everolimus was £45,288. For targeted treatments in other locations, the ICERs were ≥ £32,744 (Table 123).
The scenario using alternative costs for disease monitoring, as adopted by Novartis in its analysis submitted
to NICE, resulted in ICERs of ≥ £32,221 across GI/lung tumour locations (Table 124).
Scenario analysis using a 0% discount rate
With no discounting for costs and QALYs, sunitinib plus BSC in pNETs is the only targeted treatment in the
studied locations with an ICER of < £20,000. The only other treatment with an ICER of < £30,000 was
everolimus pus BSC in patients with lung NETs (Table 125).

Probabilistic sensitivity analyses
The sampling variation in model parameter data is consistent with everolimus having an ICER that is
> £30,000 in lung pNETs (Figure 58).
For lung NETs, the probabilistic mean ICER is £31,987. The probability that everolimus is the most
cost-effective treatment for lung NETs at the willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20,000 per QALY and
£30,000 per QALY gained is 12.6% and 46.3%, respectively (Figure 59).

Appendix 18 Sensitivity analyses
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
The probabilistic analysis suggests that the ICER for sunitinic compared with everolimus is statistically
significantly below the £20,000 incremental cost per QALY gained threshold (Figure 60).
In contrast, the ICER for everolimus plus BSC compared with BSC alone was > £20,000 and the data may
be consistent with it being > £30,000 (Figure 61).
The sampling uncertainty in the data are consistent with sunitinib having an ICER that ranges from slightly
> £30,000 to < £20,000 (Figure 62).
In line with the results illustrated in the previous figures, the probability that everolimus treatment for
pNETs is the most cost-effective treatment at the willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20,000 per QALY and
£30,000 per QALY gained is 0% and 0.6% respectively (Figure 63).

The probability of sunitinib being the most cost-effective treatment for pNETs at a willingness-to-pay
threshold of £20,000 per QALY is 21.2%; at £30,000 per QALY, sunitinib is the most cost-effective
treatment, with a probability of 44.8% (see Figure 63).
Gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
The model parameter data are consistent with everolimus having an ICER of > £30,000 per QALY gained
(Figure 64).
The probability that everolimus for GI and lung NETs is the most cost-effective treatment at the willingness￾to-pay thresholds of £20,000 per QALY and £30,000 per QALY gained is 0.9% and 10.5% respectively
(Figure 65).
Gastrointestinal (midgut) neuroendocrine tumours

Deterministic sensitivity analyses
We varied parameters to either side of their point estimates by 20%, except for utility differences between
stable disease and progressive disease, which were varied by 40%.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
In pNETs the OS HR is the most influential parameter in the model, particularly in relation to the ICER for
everolimus, which varies from £25,000 to £105,000 with the treatment effect parameter variation of 20%
around the mean point estimate (Figure 68). Other influential parameters include RDI and treatment
duration. The utility of progressive disease and stable disease are much less influential and are ranked
fourth on the list of most influential parameters in the model, with a larger influence on the ICER for
sunitinib (Figure 69).
Gastrointestinal and lung neuroendocrine tumours
Similar results to those for pNETs were found for GI and lung NETs, with variations around the point
estimate of the OS HR of ±20% yielding an increase of 300% or a decrease of about 50% in the ICER for
everolimus; RDI and mean treatment duration had smaller but significant effects (Figure 70).
Gastrointestinal (midgut) neuroendocrine tumours
The OS HR is still the most influential parameter; varying it by 20% above and below the base case
produces an ICER that varies from £43,000 to a dominated value (shown in Figure 71 as a missing bar to
the right-hand side of the point estimate). Unlike for treatments in other locations, the ICER for everolimus
in GI (midgut) NETs was sensitive to the variation in the PFS HR. This, however, is partly an artefact of how
OS was populated in the model; whereas for other locations OS data were available, for GI (midgut) NETs
we did not have OS data available and thus had to rely on imputation based on PFS differences compared
with the placebo plus BSC arm in RADIANT-4.35 As a consequence, part of the effect of PFS depicted in
Figure 71 is an indirect effect through OS.
The cost-effectiveness of 177Lu-DOTATATE is almost equally sensitive to the OS and PFS HRs, with utilities
the third most influential parameter (Figure 72).

Appendix 19 Addendum 2
Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours
The comparison between treatment with everolimus and treatment with BSC for the whole GI NETs
patient subpopulation in RADIANT-435 yielded an ICER of £26,383 (Table 126). Treatment of these patients
with everolimus results in better survival (8.25 years vs. 5.19 for BSC). Likewise, the treatment costs in the
everolimus arm are higher; this is driven by the drug acquisition costs in the preprogression health state
(Table 127).
It must be noted that these analyses were derived using:
l mean treatment durations from exponential extrapolations of the median everolimus treatment
duration (40 weeks) reported for the GI subgroup provided by Novartis on 11 November 2016 in
response to a data request by the AG
l exponential curves fitted to individual patient data derived from OS Kaplan–Meier curves and number
of patients at risk data provided by Novartis for the GI subgroup of RADIANT-435 in response to the
assessment report produced by the AG [data cut-off 30 November 2015, resulting in a HR of 0.65
(95% CI 0.37 to 1.13); the GI HR of 0.57 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.16) was provided by Novartis on
11 November 2016 in response to a data request by the AG]
l exponential curves fitted to individual patient data derived from PFS Kaplan–Meier curves for the GI
subgroup reported in the ASCO poster by Singh et al.73 (data cut-off date 28 November 2014; from
PFS curves for midgut and non-midgut subgroups in RADIANT-4,35 resulting in a HR of 0.54 (95% CI
0.36 to 0.82); the GI HR of 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.84) was provided by Novartis on 11 November
2016, in response to a data request by the AG)
l all other parameters were assumed to be the same as for the GI/lung patient population in
RADIANT-4.35
Alternative set of utility values
With alternative utility values, sunitinib has an ICER of £19,411 in patients with pNETs and everolimus has
an ICER of £28,063 in the overall GI NETs population. All other evaluated treatments have ICER values of
> £30,000 (Table 128).
Analysis limited to progression-free survival
Limiting the analytical horizon to the time of disease progression results in 177Lu-DOTATATE having the
lowest ICER (£30,115) of all of the evaluated treatments and tumour locations (Table 129).

Everolimus had an ICER of £27,669 in the overall GI NETs population when the cost of disease monitoring
that Novartis used in its model submitted to NICE was adopted (Table 132).
Scenario analysis using a 0% discount rate
When no discounting is applied to costs and benefits the ICER for everolimus in the overall GI NETs
population is £20,184 (Table 133).
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses
The model parameter data are consistent with everolimus having an ICER that is > £30,000 in the overall
GI NETs population (Figure 73).

Appendix 22 Mapping FACT-G to the
EuroQol-5 Dimensions
Linearised version of the best-fitting mapping algorithm of Longworth
et al.134
The best-fitting mapping algorithm for the FACT-G estimated by Longworth et al.134 (Table 137) maps the
domain scores of that tool into each dimension of the EQ-5D-3L by fitting a multinomial logit model to
response data for each dimension separately.
The EQ-5D index score equation (Dolan235) is:
EQ-5D index = 1− 0:081 × D1− 0:069 × Mobm − 0:314 × Mobs − 0:104 × Selfcarem − 0:214
× Selfcares − 0:036 × Usualactm − 0:094 × Usualacts − 0:123 × Painm − 0:386
× Pains − 0:071 × Anxm − 0:236 × Anxs − 0:269 × D2,
(6)
where D1 = 1 if the person had any problems in any dimension and zero otherwise, and D2 = 1 if he had any
severe problems in any dimension and zero otherwise; Mob is a binary indicator of reporting problems in the
mobility dimension; Selfcare is a binary indicator of problems in self-care; Usualact is a binary indicator of
problems with usual activities; Pain a binary indicator of problems in pain/discomfort; and Anx is an indicator
of problems in anxiety/depression. Separate indicators are used for moderate and severe problems, denoted
by the subscripts m and s respectively.
The mapping algorithm substitutes the binary indicators with the corresponding predicted probabilities of
reporting the problem in question. As in the EQ-5D-3L, there are two levels of a problem that a person can
choose as the response, the polytomous regression model is required to calculate the predicted probabilities
of reporting a given level of problem (moderate or severe) for a given dimension. As for the predicted
probabilities of reporting any problems across all dimensions (corresponding to D1) and of reporting any
severe problems across all dimensions, these could be obtained by running separate regression analyses
for dichotomous variables or by assuming that the probability of reporting problems in a dimension is
independent of doing so in any other dimension. In the latter case, the predicted probability of reporting
any severe problems (D2 = 1) is simply equal to:
D
c2 = 1− (1 − Mob ds)*(1− Selfcare d s)*(1− Usualact d s)*(1− Pain ds)*(1− Anxiety d s), (7)
where the hat symbols denote predicted probabilities of reporting the problem described by the respective
variable. The value of D
c1 is similarly obtained, except that the expressions within brackets in Equation 7
now include the predicted probability of reporting moderate problems:
D
c1 = 1− (1− Mob ds−Mob dm)*(1− Selfcare d s − Selfcare d m)*(1− Usualact d s − Usualact d m)
*(1− Pain ds − Painm)*(1− Anxiety d s − Anxiety d m).
(8)
The Longworth et al.134 response mapping algorithm (p. 220) is then used to estimate the predicted
probabilities of D1 and D2 and the 10 probabilities of reporting problem levels for the EQ-5D dimensions
on the right-hand side of Equations 7 and 8. In the case of Mob dm this is obtained by:
Mobdm j = Pm2j(PWj, EWj, FWj)≡
P(Dm j = 2jPWj, EWj, FWjÞ
= exp(α2 + βm2PWj + γm2EWj + δm2FWj)
1 + exp(α2 + βm2PWj + γm2EWj + δm2FWj) + exp(α3 + βm3PWj + γm3EWj + δm3FWj)

where Pm2j is the probability of a person j reporting ‘moderate problems’ for the EQ-5D dimension m
(mobility) and the Greek symbols represent coefficients estimated by Longworth et al.134 from a multinomial
regression of a dependent variable D, taking the value of 1 for ‘no problems’, 2 for ‘moderate’ problems
and 3 for ‘severe’ problems, against the three FACT-G domains of physical (PW), emotional (EW) and
functional (FW) well-being. The predicted probability of choosing level 3 for the dimension m is given by
the same formula but with the subscripts 2 and 3 reversed. In the same way, predicted probabilities for
the other eight domain predictions in Equations 7 and 8 are obtained, based on the coefficients of the
multinomial regression for the respective dimension.
With individual patient data on FACT-G available, the predicted probabilities for Equations 7 and 8, which
are then used to derive EQ-5D utilities using Equation 6, are obtained by first substituting the FACT-G scores
for each person in Equation 9 and then taking the mean of those predictions across the whole sample.
Repeating this process using the corresponding equation of P for ‘severe’ mobility and all other eight
possible responses provides the required probabilities to map FACT-G data into EQ-5D utilities using
Equation 6.
When, as is common in multiple technology assessment reviews or economic modelling studies, only
aggregate data are available in the form of mean FACT-G scores for a sample of patients, one cannot
directly use those values in Equation 9 and the other nine multinomial equations for obtaining the required
predicted response probabilities because their non-linear form means that the resulting predictions will
have systematic errors. To solve this issue it is proposed that each of Equation 9 and the other nine
multinomial probability equations be approximated using a first-order Taylor series expansion around the
midpoint of the FCAT-G mean covariate scores that we had available for the two health states (before
progression and after progression) in RADIANT-4,35 Thus, the linearised predictor of the probability of
response in Equation 9 is:
Mobdm J ≈ Pm2(PWo, EWo, FWo) +
∂Pm2(PWo, EWo, FWo)
∂PW *(PW−PWo)
+
∂Pm2(PWo, EWo, FWo)
∂PW *(EW−EWo) +
∂Pm2(PWo, EWo, FWo)
∂PW *(FW−FWo),
(10)
where Pm2(PWo,EWo,FWo) represents Equation 9 evaluated at the midpoint value between the mean scores
of the FACT-G domains PW, EW and FW for observations in the stable disease and disease progression
states. (Here, the issue of missing data or information lost to follow-up is ignored but is a pertinent issue
to address in further research). The derivatives of the Pm2 function are also evaluated at the midpoint and
have the following expressions:
∂Pm2(PWo, EWo, FWo)
∂PW = βm2 *Pm2 1 − Pm2 Pm2 + βm3
βm2
*Pm3
    (11)
Similar expressions are used for the other derivatives in Equation 10 and in the corresponding equations
for other EQ-5D dimensions and levels. Note that Equation 10 and the corresponding equations for other
dimensions and levels are linear in the FACT-G domain scores, which is convenient as they may be used to
approximate mean EQ-5D scores in a group of patients when only aggregate FACT-G data are available
by substituting the mean FACT-G domain scores PW, EW and FW.
Finally, substituting expressions such as Equation 10 (after substituting Equation 11 into Equation 10) for
all arguments in Equation 6 leads to the linearised mapped EQ-5D score. This linearised mapped FACT-G
function was used to approximate utilities for stable disease and disease progression using only data points
for PW, EW and FW. for the two phases, reported in Singh et al.,
73 to reproduce their reported mapped
utilities, which used the original best-fitting response mapping non-linear Longworth et al.134 algorithm
with unpublished individual patient data. Table 138 presents the two sets of these estimates.

Appendix 23 Comparison of the Assessment
Group results with the company results
Our model results can be compared with those of the companies in three areas:
1. everolimus, sunitinib and BSC in pNETs
2. everolimus and BSC in GI and lung NETs
3. everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and BSC in GI (midgut) NETs.
In all analyses, drug list prices, not PAS prices, were assumed. Life-years were not discounted.
Everolimus, sunitinib and best supportive care in pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumours
A compilatation of the main results for pNETs is presented in Table 139.
l Life-years. The estimation of expected life-years in our model and the models of Novartis33 and AAA31
differed substantially for sunitinib but were consistent for everolimus. Novartis assumed no difference
in PFS or OS between everolimus and sunitinib (mean of 4.62 life-years for both treatments), whereas
we estimated a superior PFS and OS for people treated with sunitinib (OS of 6.39 years vs. 4.62 years).
AAA’s OS estimate was significantly larger for sunitinib (8.19 years for sunitinib and 4.62 years for
everolimus). The differences arise because of the adoption of three different methodological approaches,
including differences in the parametric distribution selected for PFS/OS extrapolation. AAA did not adjust
for treatment crossover in its MTC; Novartis used an assumption of no difference in OS from the outset;
and we used publicly available survival curves with statistical adjustment for treatment crossover for each
trial in our MTC.
l QALYs. After adjusting for quality of life, our own and Novartis’s QALY estimates for everolimus
remained similar [(confidential information has been removed) and 2.73], but AAA’s estimate of time
with stable disease was higher, resulting in a higher estimate of total QALYs (3.25). Our estimate of
QALYs with sunitinib was higher than that for everolimus, because of longer PFS and OS. Novartis
estimated fewer QALYs with sunitinib than everolimus in spite of equal PFS and OS, because of
differences in disutility from SAEs. From a MTC of the most up-to-date evidence submitted to NICE
(see Appendix 21), we found the difference in the incidence of AEs between the two treatments to be
unlikely to result in meaningful utility differences.
l Costs. Treatment strategy estimates of total cost were consistent across models, including the
within-model similarity between everolimus and sunitinib. Novartis found the cost of treatments to be
less, but this is accounted for by its inclusion of other drug treatments under disease monitoring and
management. The same methodological difference is behind the differences in component costing post
progression. AAA’s estimate of everolimus and sunitinib strategy costs were significantly higher (227% and
289% respectively). In each case, this is accounted for by the overcosting of the acquisition of the active
drug, because of the company’s assumption that treatment would continue until disease progression.
l Incremental analysis compared with BSC. Given that neither Novartis nor AAA included a BSC strategy,
it is not possible to compare our ICERs for everolimus compared with BSC and sunitinib compared with
BSC with company estimates.

Everolimus and best supportive care in gastrointestinal and lung
neuroendocrine tumours
Overall, there was consistency between the cost-effectiveness results produced by us and those produced
by Novartis. A compilation of the main results is presented in Tables 139 and 140.
l Life-years. For people receiving BSC our own model and Novartis’s model33 found the number of
expected life-years to be similar, at 4.82 and 4.77, respectively, with 0.83 and 0.87 years, respectively,
of stable disease before progression. For people receiving everolimus we estimated life expectancy as
6.21 years, whereas Novartis estimated a value of 5.79 and we estimated a lower proportion with
stable disease (23% vs. 27%). This was caused by our higher estimate of OS and lower estimate of PFS
from our parametric extrapolation.
l QALYs. For people receiving BSC we estimated a lower quality of life pre and post progression than
Novartis, so, despite similar PFS and OS, slightly more QALYs for BSC were estimated by Novartis than
by us (3.51 vs. 3.05). Similarly, for people receiving everolimus we found that our higher estimates of
PFS and OS were more heavily adjusted for loss of quality of life than those of Novartis, so that our
estimate of total QALYs for everolimus was lower than Novartis’s (3.74 vs. 4.28). This is because,
although Novartis used the same utility values for stable disease and disease progression across arms,
we adopted treatment arm-specific utility estimates for stable disease, with the utility estimate likely to
be lower for everolimus than for BSC.

l Costs. Our estimate of the cost of BSC was significantly less than that of Novartis (£16,526 vs. £25,817
per person) because the estimate of the cost of disease monitoring and management in the Novartis
model was twice as high our estimate and also partly because we modelled fewer physician
consultations. Our estimate of the cost of everolimus was also lower (£47,334 vs. £59,720). This was
again because of our lower rate of resource utilisation for disease monitoring and management.
l Incremental analysis. We estimated that the ICER for everolimus compared with BSC was £44,557
per QALY gained. Novartis found an ICER of £43,642 per QALY gained. We estimated that BSC was
£30,809 less costly and provided 0.69 fewer QALYs. Novartis found that BSC was £33,903 less costly
and provided 0.78 fewer QALYs.

Our estimates of survival and costs for people who were treated with everolimus were significantly
different from those reported by AAA. In contrast, there was some consistency in the cost results for the
177Lu-DOTATATE strategy produced by the AG and AAA.
l Life-years. AAA’s31 estimates of OS for everolimus and 177-Lu-DOTATATE were substantially lower than
our own. For 177Lu-DOTATATE the difference in life expectancy (4.79 life-years in AAA’s analysis vs.
6.66 life-years in the AG analysis) arose because of the different methods used for OS extrapolation:
AAA used a proportional hazards treatment effect on a baseline Weibull distribution function, which
showed an increasing trend in death risk, whereas we used an exponential distribution, which is
characterised by a constant risk of death, supplemented by background mortality risk. AAA did not
provide any statistical evidence in support of its proportional hazards model for 177Lu-DOTATATE in
NETTER-1. We fitted separate parametric curves to 177Lu-DOTATATE in NETTER-1 and found that the
exponential model was the model with the best goodness-of-fit statistics. The differences in survival
time were most pronounced in the case of life-years post progression following everolimus, with AAA
including lung and other non-midgut NETs patients from RADIANT-435 in its calculation, and a baseline
risk of progression and death for both everolimus and 177Lu-DOATATE equal to that for people
treated with 60 mg of octreotide; instead, we used the GI (midgut) subgroup of RADIANT-435 as the
reference patient population, to which patients treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE were matched by a
Bucher-type indirect comparison adjustment method.
l QALYs. Our estimates of QALYs for everolimus and 177Lu-DOTATATE were also higher than AAA’s
estimates (3.57 vs. 1.87 for everolimus; 4.19 vs. 3.29 for 177Lu-DOTATATE), although they were
reduced by our lower estimate of utility for both pre and post progression. Therefore, the difference in
total QALYs between the models was driven by the difference in life-year estimates. We found that
BSC produced fewer QALYs (3.11) than the active treatments.
l Costs. Similar to AAA, we found that totals costs for 177Lu-DOTATATE were higher than those for
everolimus. However, our estimates were lower than those of AAA and there were significant differences
in component costs. Comparing everolimus across models, the singular significant difference in costs was
for drug acquisition; this is because AAA costed everolimus treatment until progression and did not adjust
for RDI. In RADIANT-435 the median time to progression was 11 months, compared with a median time on
treatment of 9.3 months, and the RDI was 79.4%. Comparing 177Lu-DOTATATE across models there was
agreement on the total cost but notable differences in the costs of disease monitoring and management
in stable disease, drug acquisition in progressive disease and end-of-life care. This is because AAA did not
include the cost of hospital consultations, assumed that every patient was treated with octreotide from
progression until death and opted not to include end-of-life/palliative care costs. In summation, these
under- and overestimates were counterbalancing.
l Incremental analysis. As AAA did not include a BSC strategy, there were no company figures with
which to compare our estimated additional cost, QALY gains and ICER for 177Lu-DOTATATE
versus BSC.
