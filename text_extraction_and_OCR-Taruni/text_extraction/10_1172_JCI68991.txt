Reduced trophoblast invasion and vascular conversion in decidua are thought to be the primary defect of 
common pregnancy disorders including preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Genetic studies suggest 
these conditions are linked to combinations of polymorphic killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) genes expressed 
by maternal decidual NK cells (dNK) and HLA-C genes expressed by fetal trophoblast. Inhibitory KIR2DL1 
and activating KIR2DS1 both bind HLA-C2, but confer increased risk or protection from pregnancy disorders, 
respectively. The mechanisms underlying these genetic associations with opposing outcomes are unknown. 
We show that KIR2DS1 is highly expressed in dNK, stimulating strong activation of KIR2DS1+ dNK. We used 
microarrays to identify additional responses triggered by binding of KIR2DS1 or KIR2DL1 to HLA-C2 and 
found different responses in dNK coexpressing KIR2DS1 with KIR2DL1 compared with dNK only express￾ing KIR2DL1. Activation of KIR2DS1+ dNK by HLA-C2 stimulated production of soluble products including 
GM-CSF, detected by intracellular FACS and ELISA. We demonstrated that GM-CSF enhanced migration of 
primary trophoblast and JEG-3 trophoblast cells in vitro. These findings provide a molecular mechanism 
explaining how recognition of HLA class I molecules on fetal trophoblast by an activating KIR on maternal 
dNK may be beneficial for placentation.
Introduction
During early pregnancy in humans, fetal extravillous trophoblast 
cells (EVT) invade deeply into the mucosal lining of the uterus, 
the decidua, to remodel the uterine spiral arteries into high-con￾ductance vessels (1). Reduced trophoblast invasion and vascular 
conversion results in poor placental perfusion, thought to be the 
underlying primary defect of common disorders of pregnancy, 
such as recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia and fetal growth 
restriction, although the timing and exact clinical presentation is 
affected by other genetic and environmental factors (1–3). Con￾versely, overinvasion can result in life-threatening conditions 
such as placenta percreta, where trophoblast cells can rupture the 
uterus (4). Understanding how trophoblast invasion and arterial 
remodeling are regulated is therefore crucial if we are to predict 
which pregnancies are at risk and improve management of these 
disorders.
As they invade, fetal EVT encounter maternal leukocytes, 
approximately 70% of which are decidual NK cells (dNK) (5, 6). 
These are functionally and phenotypically distinct from peripheral 
blood NK cells (pbNK), and a growing body of evidence suggests 
that they play a role in regulating trophoblast invasion (7–9). EVT 
express a unique array of HLA class I molecules; HLA-C and non￾classical HLA-E and HLA-G, but not HLA-A or HLA-B (10–12). 
dNK express cognate receptors for these, such as NKG2A, LILRB1 
and members of the killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) family (13). 
Because both KIR and their HLA-C ligands are highly polymor￾phic genes and trophoblast expresses both paternal and maternal 
HLA-C allotypes, each pregnancy will be characterized by differ￾ent combinations of maternal KIR and fetal HLA-C genes (14–16). 
Inhibitory KIR that bind to HLA-C are expressed at higher fre￾quencies in dNK than in pbNK during early pregnancy, and dNK 
show increased binding to HLA-C tetramers (17–19). Conversely, 
KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1 Fc-fusion proteins bind directly to pri￾mary trophoblast cells, demonstrating the possibility of allogeneic 
recognition of fetal trophoblast by KIR on maternal dNK (14, 18).
KIR are now recognized as major regulators of NK cell function, 
and all individuals have HLA-C allotypes that will bind to particu￾lar KIR. Inhibitory KIR2DL1 and activating KIR2DS1 bind to allo￾types of the HLA-C2 group (C2) with lysine at position 80 while 
inhibitory KIR2DL2/3 bind to HLA-C1 allotypes with asparagine 
at 80 (20, 21). There are 2 basic KIR haplotypes, A and B: A have 
mainly inhibitory receptors, while B have a variable number of 
additional activating receptors. We have shown that women with 
2 KIR A haplotypes (KIR AA genotype) in association with a HLA-C2
group in the fetus are at increased risk of disorders of placenta￾tion (14–16, 22). This risk is greatest if the fetal HLA-C2 is inherited 
from the father and the mother lacks HLA-C2 herself. The telomeric 
region of KIR B haplotypes (where activating KIR2DS1 is located) 
provides protection from pregnancy disorders. This suggests that 
in KIR AA women, binding of inhibitory KIR2DL1 to HLA-C2 on 
trophoblast results in impaired trophoblast invasion. In women 
with a KIR B haplotype, activating KIR2DS1 that also binds HLA￾C2, may enhance placentation by increasing invasion (14, 15).
The extracellular domain of KIR2DS1 closely resembles that of 
KIR2DL1 (23) but reagents are now available that allow discrimi￾nation of these inhibitory and activating receptors for HLA-C2 
(24–26). When KIR2DS1+ pbNK bind HLA-C2+ targets, cytolysis, 
cytokine production, and cell proliferation are induced (24–28). 
Since activating KIR2DS1 may be autoreactive in HLA-C2+ indi￾viduals, functional responses of KIR2DS1+ pbNK are tuned down 
or educated in C2/C2 donors compared with those who are C1/C1
(25, 28–30). There have been no studies of expression and function 
of KIR2DS1 in dNK, and we therefore compared KIR2DS1 and

KIR2DL1 in dNK with pbNK from the same woman. We show that, 
like KIR2DL1, KIR2DS1 is expressed more frequently on dNK than 
their pbNK counterparts. KIR2DS1 is functional and triggers dNK 
activation. Using expression microarrays, we identified responses 
generated by dNK when KIR2DS1 binds HLA-C2, including secre￾tion of cytokines such as GM-CSF, which we show enhances migra￾tion of primary trophoblast cells in vitro. These results link our 
genetic findings to functional responses of dNK and suggest how 
NK allorecognition may determine successful placentation.
Results
Expression of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1 by dNK. The HLA-C–specific 
KIR are expressed at higher frequency in dNK compared with pbNK 
(17–19). None of these reports distinguished between inhibitory 
KIR2DL1 or activating KIR2DS1, which both bind HLA-C2. Using 
2 mAbs, we analyzed the frequency of KIR2DS1+ and KIR2DL1+ cells 
in matched samples of freshly isolated dNK and pbNK (Figure 1). 
NK cells were classified into 4 subsets: KIR2DS1+KIR2DL1–, 
KIR2DS1–KIR2DL1+, KIR2DS1+KIR2DL1+, and KIR2DS1–
KIR2DL1–. For simplicity, these were named KIR2DS1 single 
positive (KIR2DS1sp), KIR2DL1sp, double positive (dp), and 
double negative (dn) respectively (Figure 1A).The overall fre￾quency of KIR2DL1 expression in dNK is increased (mean 36%, 
range 3–55) compared with that in pbNK (mean 15%, range 1–23). 
KIR2DS1 is also increased in dNK (mean 36%, range 11–59) 
compared with blood (mean 14%, range 4–35) (Figure 1B). There 
is a small rise in frequency of the KIR2DS1sp subset in dNK com￾pared with their blood counterparts, but the dp subset is signifi￾cantly increased (Figure 1C). The frequencies of KIR2DL1+ or 
KIR2DS1+ dNK are unaffected by the maternal HLA-C genotype 
and are similar in women with C1 or C2 alleles (Supplemental 
Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI68991DS1). All 4 dNK subsets shown in Figure 1A 
showed significantly higher staining for Ki-67 in dNK compared 
with their blood counterparts. This was highest in the dp subset, 
correlating with the increased frequency of the dp subset in dNK 
(Supplemental Figure 2).
KIR2DS1 on dNK is functional. To study the function of KIR2DS1, 
we used crosslinking with the mAb 11PB6 or a control IgG1 anti￾body and assessed degranulation by CD107a staining of dNK sub￾sets expressing KIR2DL1 or KIR2DS1, gated as shown in Figure 1A. 
These dNK subsets will coexpress other NK receptors (NKRs). 
Upon crosslinking, good degranulation responses are seen in 
KIR2DS1sp but not in KIR2DL1sp, dp, and dn subsets, indicating 
KIR2DS1 is functional in dNK (Figure 1D). All subsets degranu￾late to the same extent using a mAb to NKp46 (Supplemental 
Figure 3). We then examined the function of KIR2DS1 and KIR2DL1 
dNK in response to their physiological ligand HLA-C2. How￾ever, we found that other NKRs that can bind HLA-C2 directly or 
affect NK education (LILRB1, KIR2DL2/L3/S2, KIR3DL1, and

Frequency of KIR2DS1+ and KIR2DL1+ dNK is increased compared with pbNK from the same donors and KIR2DS1 is functional in dNK.

expression using mAbs EB6 and 143211. dNK are shown and were also gated on CD9+ cells to avoid contamination with pbNK. (B) Overall

as a percentage of total NK cells was determined in paired samples of fresh NK cells from blood or decidua (data for dn subset not shown, 
n = 13). Horizontal bars show mean for each group. (D) The responsiveness of the KIR2DS1sp, KIR2DL1sp, and dp dNK subsets was measured 
by stimulating either with control IgG (IgG con) or with mAb 11PB6, which crosslinks both KIR2DS1 and KIR2DL1. Degranulation was assessed 
by staining for surface CD107a or control IgG (n = 5). KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1 subsets were gated after FACS staining, as shown in A and will 
thus express a variety of other NK receptors. Basal responses were seen in the dn subset (data not shown). *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, Wilcoxon

KIR2DS4) are not expressed equally on the KIR2DS1sp and dp 
dNK subpopulations (Figure 2, B–D, and Supplemental Figure 4). 
Therefore, to examine the functional responses of the KIR2DL1/S1 
subsets to HLA-C2 in the absence of such confounding effects, 
dNK expressing these other NKRs were gated out from the analy￾sis, except where specifically stated. Significant degranulation of 
KIR2DS1sp cells was seen in response to 721.221 cells transfected 
with HLA-Cw*0602 (221-C2) that was abolished by coincubation 
with the anti–HLA class I–blocking mAb 6A4 (Figure 3, A and B). 
As with activation by crosslinking, no significant degranulation 
was seen in KIR2DL1sp or dp subsets, indicating that inhibition by 
KIR2DL1 overrides activation of KIR2DS1 by HLA-C2 when they are 
coexpressed. Coexpression of other NKRs that recognize HLA class 
I resulted in decreased responses of KIR2DS1sp dNK to 221-C2, but 
these responses were still significantly higher than in the dp subset 
(Figure 3C). KIR2DS1sp dNK that are also NKR+ make up approxi￾mately 11% of the total dNK population (Supplemental Figure 5A). 
Individual NKRs differ in their effect on the degranulation response 
of KIR2DS1sp dNK with 221-C2 target cells, with coexpression of 
LILRB1 having the least effect and KIR2DL1 the most (Supplemen￾tal Figure 5B). Activation of KIR2DS1sp dNK in response to 221-C2 
targets is higher in dNK from C1/C1 homozygous individuals com￾pared with those with at least 1 copy of HLA-C2 (C2/X) (Figure 3D).
Because NK cells are sensitive to levels of HLA class I expression, 
we compared how KIR2DS1sp pbNK and dNK from the same 
donor responded to 221-C2 targets with increasing levels of sur￾face expression of the same HLA-C2 allele (Cw*0602). KIR2DS1sp 
dNK showed lower maximal responses than their pbNK counter￾parts, but in both, the level of response was dependent on the tar￾get HLA-C expression level (Figure 3, E and F, and Supplemental 
Figure 6). dNK achieved maximal activation at lower HLA-C2 lev￾els on 221-C2 target cells, suggesting they are more sensitive than 
pbNK to low levels of KIR2DS1 ligand.
Transcriptional responses of KIR2DS1+ or KIR2DL1+ dNK triggered 
by HLA-C2 ligand. Ligation of activating receptors on NK cells 
triggers a variety of responses, including cytokine secretion and 
expression of molecules involved in cell-cell adhesion (31). We 
used gene expression microarrays to investigate the changes in 
RNA transcript levels in the 4 KIR2DS1 or KIR2DL1 dNK subsets 
from a single donor that were triggered in response to coculture 
with either 721.221-parent (221-parent) or 221-C2 cells. Cluster 
analysis showed that each subset has a distinctive mRNA expres￾sion profile (Figure 4A). Only 45 transcripts differ by 2.5-fold in 
the KIR2DL1sp subset, while in the KIR2DS1sp subset, 378 tran￾scripts differ by at least 2.5-fold in expression level and 289 tran￾scripts differ in the dp subset (Supplemental Table 1). Remark￾ably, only 24 transcripts were altered in common between the 
KIR2DS1sp and the dp subset even though they both expressed 
KIR2DS1. The small degree of overlap suggests that each sub￾set has its own unique response to HLA-C2. We were particu￾larly interested in factors that might be directly responsible for 
paracrine modulation of EVT migration and focused on altered 
transcripts encoding cytokines or cell surface receptors/adhesion 
molecules (Figure 4C). Transcripts for 4 secreted proteins were 
upregulated in KIR2DS1sp dNK more than 2.5-fold: IFN-γ, CSF2 
(GM-CSF), and chemokines XCL2 and CCL3L3. IFN-γ was not 
specifically upregulated by KIR2DS1, since it was also increased in 
the other subsets (Supplemental Table 1).
We focused on GM-CSF to demonstrate how activation of 
KIR2DS1 might enhance placentation. Intracellular staining for 
GM-CSF confirmed that KIR2DS1sp dNK (without expression 
of other NKR) specifically upregulate GM-CSF production after 
coculture with 221-C2 cells compared with the KIR2DL1sp and 
dp subsets (Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure 7A). KIR2DS1+ 
dNK (with expression of other NKRs but not KIR2DL1) also 
showed increased intracellular staining for GM-CSF, although this 
response was lower than for KIR2DS1sp NKR– cells. This suggests 
that KIR2DS1 triggering by HLA-C2 upregulates GM-CSF even in 
cells that coexpress inhibitory NKRs that can bind HLA-C2. These 
results were confirmed using crosslinking with mAb EB6, which 
binds both KIR2DS1 and KIR2DL1 in samples of bulk dNK. GM￾CSF secretion was detected by ELISA in culture supernatants and 
was significantly increased in KIR2DS1+ but not KIR2DS1– donors 
after cross-linking (Figure 5B). Despite the fact that KIR2DS1+

each subset and then compared between the KIR2DS1sp 
and dp subsets. Horizontal bars show mean for each group.

cells that do not coexpress KIR2DL1 represent approximately 13% 
of total dNK (Supplemental Figure 5A), activation of KIR2DS1 
does result in significant GM-CSF secretion.
GM-CSF produced by dNK after activation of KIR2DS1 stimulates 
trophoblast migration in vitro. We then investigated the function of 
GM-CSF in enabling normal placentation because our genetic 
data suggests that binding of KIR2DS1 on dNK to trophoblast 
HLA-C2 is beneficial when there is a HLA-C2 group in the fetus. 
First, we localized expression of GM-CSF receptor α (GM-CSFRα) 
in vivo by immunohistochemistry. There was intense expression 
of GM-CSFRα by interstitial EVT in decidua at sites densely infil￾trated by maternal dNK, where dNK can be seen closely associated 
with EVT (Figure 6, A–E). GM-CSFRα expression was confirmed 
by flow cytometry using primary trophoblast cells (Figure 6F) and 
the choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 (data not shown). Superna￾tants of dNK in which KIR2DS1 had been activated by crosslink￾ing contained increased levels of GM-CSF as shown in Figure 5B. 
These supernatants stimulated JEG-3 migration through fibronec￾tin-coated Transwells and the effect was significantly reduced by 
addition of neutralizing GM-CSF antibody, compared with super￾natant with isotype control mAb added (Figure 6G). Recombinant 
GM-CSF also increased the migration of primary trophoblast cells 
through Transwells and enhanced the motility of JEG-3 cells in 
a scratch assay (Figure 6H and Supplemental Figure 8). Thus, 
KIR2DS1+ dNK produced GM-CSF following activation, and this 
enhanced the migration of primary trophoblast and choriocarci￾noma cells in vitro.
Discussion
The response of maternal uterine NK cells to allogeneic fetal tro￾phoblast at the site of placentation is analogous to the situation 
during HSC transplantation (HSCT) when donor cells confront 
allogeneic recipient cells (32–34). Women with KIR AA genotypes 
who lack HLA-C2 but have a HLA-C2+ fetus are most at risk of preg￾nancy disorders such as preeclampsia. KIR2DS1 is located in the 
telomeric region of KIR B haplotypes and is associated with protec￾tion from pregnancy disorders when the fetus is HLA-C2+ (14, 15, 22)
Similarly, patients with myeloid leukemia who receive grafts 
from donors with KIR B haplotypes that contain KIR2DS1 show 
improved survival (35). This effect depends on the HLA-C1 or HLA￾C2 status of the donor and is stronger if the donor lacks HLA-C2
but it is present in the recipient. We therefore set out to determine

how our genetic findings in pregnancy translate into some dNK 
function beneficial for placentation during early pregnancy.
Initially, we studied the expression of KIR2DS1 in dNK. Over￾all frequencies of both KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1 are dramatically 
increased in dNK compared with pbNK from the same donor. 
The number of dNK that coexpress both receptors was somewhat 
larger than predicted by the product rule (36). How the selective 
increase of KIRs in dNK specific for HLA-C occurs in the decidual 
microenvironment is unknown, but it is a response to pregnancy, 
since it is not seen in nonpregnant endometrium (13). The dp cells 
do proliferate more than the KIR2DS1sp and KIRDL1sp subsets, 
which may partially explain their prominence in the decidua. IL-15 
is transpresented by stromal cells during decidualization and can 
induce dNK proliferation, maturation, and acquisition of KIR, but 
not this skewing toward KIR2D specific for HLA-C (13, 37–40). 
TGF-β can affect the phenotype of dNK and is abundant in 
decidua (39–41). Changes in MHC class I molecules expressed by 
stromal cells can also modulate the receptor repertoire of NK cells 
in vitro or after HSCT (42–44). Although expression of HLA-C on 
uterine stromal cells increases during decidualization, with the 
modest numbers studied here, we found no association between 
maternal HLA-C1 or HLA-C2 and KIR2DL1 or KIR2DS1 frequen￾cies in dNK, as previously shown by others in pbNK (25, 45). 
Sample numbers did not permit us to determine whether fetal 
HLA-C1 or HLA-C2 affects KIR2DL1/S1 frequencies indepen￾dently of maternal HLA-C. Decidual stroma and dNK are in inti￾mate contact but the exact factors responsible for expansion of 
this dp remain unclear. Nonetheless, the outcome is that when￾ever a paternal HLA-C2 is expressed by trophoblast, there will be 
large numbers of dNK potentially able to respond to this nonself 
HLA-C. The finding that allogeneic mouse matings differing only 
in paternal MHC produce heavier fetuses than syngeneic matings 
strongly supports the idea that recognition of paternal MHC by 
maternal immune cells is a generalized mechanism to regulate pla￾cental development (46).
Triggering of dNK with mAb to KIR2DL1/S1 or with HLA￾C2+ targets results in selective degranulation and cytokine secre￾tion by the KIR2DS1sp cells, but all subsets respond to the same 
extent when triggered by mAb to NKp46. In addition, a mAb (6A4) 
known to block binding of KIR2DS1 to HLA-C2+ targets inhib￾Figure 4

its KIR2DS1sp activation (47). The HLA-C1 or HLA-C2 status of 
the mother is also important as KIR2DS1sp dNK from C1/C1
donors respond better to HLA-C2+ targets than those from C2/C1
heterozygotes. This contrasts with pbNK, where tuning down 
of KIR2DS1 responses to HLA-C2 was observed only in HLA-C2
homozygotes (25, 26, 29, 30). The rheostat model of NK education 
proposes that NK cell function is “tuned” by interactions between 
inhibitory and activating receptors on the cell and their ligands 
during NK development, and quantity of MHC also affects NK 
cell responsiveness (48, 49). Indeed, we show that dNK appear to 
be more sensitive to lower levels of HLA-C, and this may explain 
why we found evidence of dNK tuning via KIR2DS1 even in C2/C1 
heterozygotes. Since these mature dNK proliferate in situ, tuning 
presumably takes place or is maintained within the decidua. These 
functional findings correlate well with our genetic studies of preg￾nancy disorders in which the presence/absence of HLA-C2 in the 
mother as well as the baby influences the outcome (14).
CD107a is a convenient measure of NK cell activation in 
response to HLA-C2, but cytokine production is more physiologi￾cally relevant to pregnancy (7). To avoid nonphysiological respons￾es due to culture with high levels of IL-2 or IL-15, we used primary 
dNK exposed overnight to a low dose of IL-15, which maintains 
good viability with minimal activation (50, 51). Under these con￾ditions, IFN-γ is not a useful readout, as the levels produced and 
number of dNK responding is low (31, 52). Therefore, we used 
microarrays to identify the mRNA responses of KIR2DL1/S1 
subsets following coculture with either 221-C2 or 221-parent cells. 
In KIR2DS1sp cells, which degranulate in response to HLA-C2, 
nearly 400 transcripts change, but in KIR2DL1sp cells, which 
do not degranulate, the transcriptional responses are subdued. 
In dp cells, KIR2DL1 overrides any degranulation stimulated by 
KIR2DS1, as it does in pbNK, but other aspects of the response 
are robust. This suggests divergence of the pathways regulating 
degranulation and the transcriptional responses mediated by 
KIR2DS1 in dp cells. Surprisingly, there was very little overlap in 
the transcriptional responses of the KIR2DS1sp and the dp sub￾sets. Although we excluded confounding factors such as expres￾sion of other NKRs that might be responsible for different levels of

dNK education in the initial dNK preparation for the microarrays, 
we found that each KIR2DL1/S1 subset had a complex and unique 
response to HLA-C2. The molecular basis for this is not clear, but 
the responses generated by KIR2DS1 were thus context depen￾dent, and this receptor may trigger completely different transcrip￾tional responses in KIR2DS1sp and dp subsets. This aspect of the 
responses of different dNK subsets to HLA-C2 may well apply to 
other activating and inhibitory receptor combinations when they 
are coexpressed in other NK subsets. The microarray analysis was 
performed on the 4 KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1 subsets from a single 
donor and must therefore be treated with caution. However, the 
fact that the GM-CSF response of KIR2DS1sp cells identified in 
this way was validated at the protein level in multiple other donors 
increases confidence in this approach.
dNK do not normally kill trophoblast cells unless activated by 
IL-2, but this cytokine is not found in the decidua. Instead, their 
function is probably to produce cytokines, enzymes, and other 
products that may regulate trophoblast invasion (7, 31, 53–55). 
Given the protective effect of KIR2DS1 in our genetic studies of 
preeclampsia, we therefore sought proteins induced after stimula￾tion of KIR2DS1+ dNK by HLA-C2+ targets. Of those we identified, 
GM-CSF was studied in detail to demonstrate that dNK products 
induced by ligation of maternal KIR by fetal HLA-C can regulate 
placentation. Secretion of GM-CSF is specifically upregulated in 
KIR2DS1sp but not dp dNK after coculture with HLA-C2+ tar￾get cells. Although the KIR2DS1sp subset accounts for a minor￾ity of the total dNK compartment, activation of KIR2DS1 results 
in increased GM-CSF secretion into supernatants of bulk dNK 
preparations. The GM-CSFRα is strongly expressed by the EVT 
in decidua that are in close contact with dNK. In vitro, GM-CSF 
enhances invasion by primary trophoblast as well as JEG-3 chorio￾carcinoma cells. Studies in GM-CSF–deficient mice support the 
idea that placental development and fetal growth are impaired in 
the absence of maternal GM-CSF, but the mechanism of this effect 
is unknown (56). The mechanisms regulating trophoblast migra￾tion and transformation of the spiral arteries are complex, and 
other dNK products induced by activation of KIR2DS1, includ￾ing chemokines and cytokines, will also be important. Indeed, 
we only saw partial reduction of trophoblast migration with a 
GM-CSF–blocking antibody. Our hypothesis was that activation 
of KIR2DS1 by a HLA-C2+ fetus enhances trophoblast invasion 
and vascular transformation of spiral arteries. This process is 
frequently defective in pregnancies affected by disorders such as 
preeclampsia and FGR, as shown by uterine artery Dopplers and 
anatomical studies of the placental bed (3). We propose that, in a 
KIR2DS1+ woman with a HLA-C2+ fetus, the dNK activation that 
ensues allows trophoblast to invade even more deeply into the 
decidua. In contrast, women with only KIR2DL1 and a HLA-C2 
fetus are at risk of pregnancy disorders where EVT may not effec￾tively transform the more distal myometrial segments of the spiral 
arteries. Exactly how the process is regulated in vivo in the deeper 
portions of the decidua and myometrium is not known, but one 
possibility is that, as well as encouraging migration, KIR2DS1 acti￾vation also prevents EVT differentiation to static giant cells. Until 
more reliable human trophoblast cell lines become widely avail￾able, it will be difficult to investigate this further.
In conclusion, our observations suggest how women with 
KIR2DS1 and a HLA-C2+ fetus may have better trophoblast inva￾sion and spiral artery remodeling than women with KIR AA geno￾types who are at higher risk of preeclampsia (57). Activation of 
KIR2DS1 on dNK by HLA-C triggers responses that enhance tro￾phoblast migration and also change the responses of dNK that 
coexpress the “risky” inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1. Our study thus 
provides what we believe is the first important link between dNK 
function and our genetic studies showing that particular combi￾nations of maternal KIR and fetal HLA-C genotypes are associated 
with different pregnancy outcomes.
Methods
Primary tissue. Decidua were obtained from donors undergoing elective 
termination between 7 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. Primary trophoblast 
cells and decidual leukocytes (DL) were isolated by enzymatic digestion 
of placental or decidual tissue as described previously (58). Trophoblast 
cells were cultured overnight in Ham’s F12, antibiotics, and 20% FCS on 
fibronectin before analysis by FACS with HLA-G–specific antibody (clone 
MEM-G/9; AbD Serotec). Decidual samples were analyzed by FACS after 
staining with anti-CD56, anti-CD3, and anti-CD9 to evaluate peripheral 
blood contamination (8, 13). DL preparations were typically composed of 
more than 50% dNK. For functional assays, DL preparations were cultured 
overnight in RPMI 1640 medium, antibiotics, 10% FCS. and 2.5 ng/ml 
IL-15. This low dose of IL-15 maintains dNK viability without significant 
activation (50). PBMCs were isolated from the same donor at the same 
week of gestation using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield) and stained or cultured 
in same conditions as for DL.
Genotyping of KIR and HLA-C. KIR and HLA-C were typed from genomic 
DNA by PCR for their presence or absence as described previously (14, 15). 
KIR genes typed were 3DL1, 3DS1, 2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3, 2DL5, 2DS1, 2DS2, 
2DS3, 2DS4, 2DS5, and 2DP1. Typing for HLA-C was performed using a 
similar approach, which allowed all known HLA-C group HLA-C1 alleles to 
be distinguished from HLA-C2 alleles.
Phenotyping NK cells and trophoblast by flow cytometry. 106 fresh cells from 
blood or decidua were washed with PBS, resuspended in 100 μl FACS 
buffer (PBS + 1% FCS + 0.1% sodium azide), and incubated with 5 μg/ml 
human γ-globulins (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes to block nonspecific 
binding. To determine the frequency of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1, cells were 
stained with 10 μl KIR2DL1-FITC mAb (clone 143211; R&D Systems) for 
15 minutes at room temperature. Then 5 μl KIR2DL1/S1-APC mAb (clone 
EB6; Beckman Coulter) was added together with antibodies against other 
surface markers for 20 minutes at 4°C. Other antibodies used were as 
follows: KIR2DL2/L3/S2-PE (clone GL183), LILRB1-PE (clone HP-F1), 
NKG2A-PE (clone Z199), and KIR2DS4 (clone FES172) (Beckman Coulter); 
KIR3DL1-PE (clone DX9; BD Biosciences), CD56–brilliant violet 
(clone HCD56; Biolegend), CD3-APC-Cy7 (clone UCHT1; BioLegend), 
and CD9-PerCP Cy5.5 (M-L13, BD Biosciences — Pharmingen). Fur￾ther details of antibodies used in multicolor flow cytometry are given 
in Supplemental Table 2. Dead cells were excluded with near IR fixable 
live/dead cell dye (Invitrogen). Cells were washed with FACS buffer twice 
and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Samples were run on LSR Fortessa 
FACS analyzer (BD Biosciences) and data analyzed using FlowJo 8.0. 
Freshly isolated primary trophoblast cells and the JEG-3 choriocarci￾noma cell line were analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described 
(12). Briefly, cells were stained with directly conjugated mAb to iden￾tify leukocyte or trophoblast cell populations using MEM-G/9-FITC 
to HLA-G (AbD Serotec) and CD14-PE (clone HCD14; BioLegend).
Functional assays. DL preparations (>50% dNK) with less than 5% pbNK 
contamination (CD56+CD9–) were used in functional assays. For KIR cross￾linking followed by flow cytometry, 96-well plates (Costar EIA) were coated 
with crosslinking antibody against KIR2DL1/S1 (clone 11PB6; Miltenyi 
Biotec) or NKP46 (clone 195314; R&D Systems) in 50 mM HEPES buffer for 
4 hours at concentrations between 0 and 10 μg/ml. Optimal antibody con-

8. Koopman LA, et al. Human decidual natural killer 
cells are a unique NK cell subset with immunomodu￾centration (2.5 μg/ml) was determined by titration. Matched isotype mAbs 
were used as controls. 2 × 105 dNK per well were incubated for 5 hours. 
6 μg/ml Golgi-Stop (BD Biosciences) and Brefeldin (Sigma-Aldrich) were 
added for the last 4 hours of the incubation. The degranulation response 
was assessed by staining with anti-CD107a–PerCP Cy5.5 (clone H4A3; 
BioLegend) after first staining dNK subsets as described above. EB6 was 
used for KIR2DL1/S1 crosslinking to assess GM-CSF secretion by ELISA 
with no Golgi-Stop or Brefeldin added. GM-CSF secretion was quantified 
using the Duoset ELISA (R&D Systems).
NK cells were also stimulated by incubation with 721.221 HLA-null par￾ent cells (221-parent), or with 721.221 cells transfected either with the group 
2 HLA-C allele Cw*0602 (221-C2) or 721.221 cells expressing Cw*0102 
(221-C1). Medium alone or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) 
(20 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml) together were used as negative and 
positive controls. The effector/target (E/T) ratio was 5:1. To obtain 221-C2 
clones with different HLA-C2 surface expression intensity, bulk 221-C2 
cells were diluted in 96-well plates at 1 cell per well. Individual clones 
were stained with mAb W6/32 to identify those with different HLA-C 
expression. Readouts of NK activation were as follows: CD107a or the 
cytokines IFN-γ (clone 4S.B3 Biolegend) or GM-CSF (clone BVD2-21C11; 
BD Bioscience). Cells were first stained for surface markers to identify 
KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1 NK subsets, then fixed, permeabilized, and stained 
for intracellular cytokines with PerCP Cy5.5 mAbs using intracellular 
staining buffers (BioLegend).
Expression profiling by microarray. Total dNK were purified by negative selec￾tion using MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec) after overnight culture in RPMI 
with 10% FCS and 2.5 ng/ml IL-15. The purified dNK were then cocultured 
in a 1:1 ratio with either 221-parent or 221-C2 cells for 12 hours in the same 
medium. KIR2DL1/S1 subsets of dNK (CD56+CD9+CD3–) were sorted using 
a DakoCytomation MoFlo cytometer and Summit software after gating out 
cells expressing KIR3DL1, KIR2DL3/L2/S2, LILRB1, and KIR2DS4. Total 
RNA was isolated from each subset using RNEasy (QIAGEN). cDNA was 
synthesized using 50 ng of total RNA and biotinylated using the Pico WTA 
system and Encore module (Nugen). Biotinylated cDNA was hybridized to 
Human HT-12 V4 BeadArrays (Illumina). Background corrected and sum￾marized expression scores for each microarray probe set were converted to 
log2 expression units and normalized by Quantile normalization implement￾ed in the lumi package for Bioconductor (59). Microarray data are available 
from the ArrayExpress microarray data repository (E-MTAB-1784).
Chemotaxis and cell motility assays. Migration assays using the choriocarci￾noma line JEG-3, were performed in 24-well plates using Transwell inserts 
with 12-μm pores (PIXPO1250; Millipore) coated with 1 μg/ml fibronectin 
(BD Biosciences). JEG-3 cells were grown in RPMI, 10% FCS. and seeded at 
2 × 104 cells per insert, with or without GM-CSF added to the medium in 
the lower part of the chamber. After 48 hours. the number of JEG-3 cells 
that had migrated into the lower chamber was quantified by the addition 
of calcein AM (4 μg/ml) to the lower chamber for 1 hour as described by the 
manufacturer (Biotium) and total fluorescence measured using a Synergy 
HT plate reader (Biotek). When using primary trophoblast cells, the cells 
were allowed to migrate for 48 hours and the cells on the upper side of 
the membrane were removed with a cotton bud so that only the migrated 
cells on the underside were quantified by staining with anti–cytokeratin-7 
antibody (clone MNF116; Dako) as described previously (60). This meth￾od ensures only migrating trophoblast cells were counted, since primary 
cultures are not completely pure. The number of trophoblast cells that 
had migrated was quantified by counting cytokeratin+ cells at 800 ran￾dom points on the membrane using Visiopharm software. The effect of 
GM-CSF on trophoblast motility was assessed using a “scratch”’ wound￾healing assay. 3.5 × 104 JEG-3 were seeded in a culture-insert dish over￾night (product 81176; Ibidi) and the insert removed to create a defined 
“wound” of 500 μm in width at the start of the experiment. The medium 
was changed (with or without 10 ng/ml GM-CSF added) and cells photo￾graphed at indicated time points to monitor cell motility.
Immunohistology. 5 μm cryostat sections of the first-trimester human 
implantation site were fixed in cold acetone, rehydrated with PBS, and 
blocked with PBS/1% BSA/2% goat serum before staining for 1 hour with 
mAb for GM-CSFRα (clone 4H1; BioLegend) diluted 1/50. Slides were 
washed in PBS, then bound antibody visualized with goat-anti-mouse 
IgG1–Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen). Free anti-mouse sites were blocked 
with mouse IgG (1 μg/ml) before staining with anti–HLA-G-FITC for 
1 hour (clone MEM-G/9; AbD Serotec). Slides were rinsed in PBS and 
mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and 
photographed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope.
Statistics. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare 2 groups 
of paired data, and the Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of 
groups of nonpaired data. Student’s t test (2 tailed) was employed for ana￾lyzing normally distributed data obtained from cell lines in vitro. A non￾parametric Friedman test with Dunn multiple comparison post test was 
used to test for differences in between multiple KIR2DS1sp subsets with 
different NKRs. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Study approval. The Cambridge Research Ethics Committee approved 
this study (04/Q0108/23 and 08/H0305/40). Informed written consent 
was obtained from all donors.
