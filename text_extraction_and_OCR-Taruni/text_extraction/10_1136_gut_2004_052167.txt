Background: Diabetes has been associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in
studies of referred patients. This is the first population based case control study in the USA to examine this
association while adjusting for other major risk factors related to HCC.
Methods: We used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End-Results Program (SEER)-Medicare linked
database to identify patients aged 65 years and older diagnosed with HCC and randomly selected non￾cancer controls between 1994 and 1999. Only cases and controls with continuous Medicare enrolment for
three years prior to the index date were examined. Inpatient and outpatient claims files were searched for
diagnostic codes indicative of diabetes, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), alcoholic liver
disease, and haemochromatosis. HCC patients without these conditions were categorised as idiopathic.
Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated in logistic regression analyses.
Results: We identified 2061 HCC patients and 6183 non-cancer controls. Compared with non-cancer
controls, patients with HCC were male (66% v 36%) and non-White (34% v 18%). The proportion of HCC
patients with diabetes (43%) was significantly greater than non-cancer controls (19%). In multiple logistic
regression analyses that adjusted for demographics features and other HCC risk factors (HCV, HBV,
alcoholic liver disease, and haemochromatosis), diabetes was associated with a threefold increase in the
risk of HCC. In a subset of patients without these major risk factors, the adjusted odds ratio for diabetes
declined but remained significant (adjusted odds ratio 2.87 (95% confidence interval 2.49–3.30)). A
significant positive interaction between HCV and diabetes was detected (p,0.0001). Similar findings
persisted in analyses restricted to diabetes recorded between two and three years prior to HCC diagnosis.
Conclusions: Diabetes is associated with a 2–3-fold increase in the risk of HCC, regardless of the presence
of other major HCC risk factors. Findings from this population based study suggest that diabetes is an
independent risk factor for HCC.
T
he incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has
increased significantly over the past two decades in the
USA.1 2 The age adjusted incidence of HCC increased
from 1.3 per 100 000 for the period 1981–1983 to 3.0 per
100 000 for the period 1996–1998.2 The cause of this increase
in HCC is incompletely understood. Approximately half of
this increase is attributed to hepatitis C virus (HCV), while a
minimal or no increase has been related to hepatitis B virus
(HBV) or alcoholic liver disease.3 4 In general, approximately
15–50% of HCC cases remain idiopathic, suggesting that
other risk factors are responsible for this increase in HCC.
Diabetes has been suggested as a potential risk factor for
HCC. However, the causal association between diabetes and
HCC is difficult to study. On the one hand, diabetes is a risk
factor for non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD), including its
most severe form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),5–10
which can lead to cirrhosis and subsequently HCC. On the
other hand, end stage liver disease itself can cause glucose
intolerance and overt diabetes.11 Moreover, some causes of
liver disease (for example, HCV and haemochromatosis) have
been associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Several
studies have examined the association between HCC and
diabetes.12–18 Earlier studies reported no association between
diabetes and HCC while more recent studies have identified
diabetes as a risk factor for HCC.12 13 15 17 18 For example, a
cohort study conducted in patients identified at hospitals of
Veterans Affairs found a greater than twofold increase in the
relative risk of HCC among male veterans with diabetes in the
absence of HCV, HBV, and alcoholic cirrhosis.12 However, the
generalisability of these results to the overall US population
may be limited; all except for one small study17 were based on
referral samples. Moreover, selection bias may have occurred
in which patients with diabetes were more likely to be tested
and diagnosed with HCC, and therefore more likely to be
enrolled in these studies.
We conducted a population based case control study using
the linked records of patients with HCC identified from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) regis￾tries to Medicare claims.19 The purpose of this study was to
determine whether an association exists between HCC and
diabetes in Medicare enrolled patients age 65 years and older.
Furthermore, we examined the effect of diabetes in relation
to the presence of other risk factors, including HCV, HBV,
alcoholic liver disease, and haemochromatosis.
METHODS
Data source
The SEER-Medicare database is the linkage of SEER registry
information with Medicare claims data. The SEER pro￾gramme is an ongoing contract supported programme of the
National Cancer Institute to collect population based cancer
incidence and survival data. Since 1992, the SEER pro￾gramme has collected data on incident cancer cases from 11
cancer registries in five states (Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa,
New Mexico, and Utah) and six metropolitan areas (Los
Angeles, San Francisco/Oakland, San Jose, Detroit, Seattle,

and Atlanta) that account for approximately 14% of the
population in the USA.19 For each case identified, the SEER
programme collects demographic features, date of cancer
diagnosis, cancer site, and method of diagnosis (histology,
cytology, microscopic confirmation (method not specified),
laboratory test/marker study, direct visualisation or positive
radiology tests). The International Classification of Diseases
for Oncology (ICD-O-2) is employed by SEER to classify
primary site and histological type for cancer.20
Medicare is the primary health insurer for approximately
97% of individuals aged 65 years and older in the USA.
Medicare claims data are collected for both Medicare part
A and part B benefits. Approximately 95% of Medicare
beneficiaries are covered by both part A and part B benefits.
Persons less than 65 years of age are eligible for Medicare
benefits due to disability or end stage renal disease; these
patients were excluded from the study as they are signifi￾cantly different from patients aged 65 years and older in their
clinical characteristics and demographic features.19 Claims
information from inpatient hospitalisations covered by
Medicare part A benefits are included in the Medicare
Provider Analysis and Review files. This file contains up to 10
diagnosis and 10 procedure codes using ICD-9-CM codes.
Medicare claims data for all part B covered benefits include
physician/supplier services, and contain ICD-9-CM diagnosis
codes and Current Procedural Terminology 4 codes for all
billed claims.
The linked SEER-Medicare data is a collaborative effort by
the National Cancer Institute, the SEER registries, and
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This database
contains Medicare part A and part B claims data beginning in
1991 for all Medicare enrolled patients identified by SEER
registries. The linkage captures approximately 93% of
patients in the SEER database aged 65 years and older.
Additional details regarding this linkage were described
elsewhere.19
The SEER-Medicare database also contains Medicare files
for beneficiaries without cancer residing in the SEER areas. A
5% random sample of beneficiaries is provided to serve as a
comparison ‘‘control’’ population for Medicare patients
identified by the SEER registries. The contents of Medicare
files for the ‘‘control’’ sample are identical to those available
for patients with cancer.19
Study population
To include both cases and controls with equal exposure to
risk factor information, we selected only those with
continuous enrolment in Medicare parts A and B for at least
the three years prior to cancer diagnosis or the randomly
selected index date for non-cancer controls. We excluded
both cases and controls enrolled in a health maintenance
organisation (HMO) during this time period as Medicare
HMO plans have not been required to submit individual
claims to CMS for specific services received by patients
enrolled in Medicare.19
HCC cases
All patients aged 65 years and older diagnosed with HCC in
SEER registries who were also enrolled in Medicare between
1994 and 1999 were eligible for inclusion. Only patients
with diagnostic confirmation of HCC (ICD-O histology
code = 8170) were included. Diagnostic confirmation was
defined as having positive histology, cytology, laboratory test/
marker study, direct visualisation, or positive radiology tests.
Patients with a clinical diagnosis only or unknown method of
confirmation were excluded. Patients whose HCC diagnoses
were reported exclusively by death certificates or at autopsy
were also excluded. For these patients, no other information
regarding their HCC diagnosis was available from the medical
record.20 In addition, we excluded patients diagnosed with
stomach, colon, lung, pancreatic, breast, or rectal cancers
within the five years prior to the date of HCC diagnosis to
further ensure the inclusion of only HCC, rather than
metastatic liver cancers.
Population based non-cancer controls
Population based non-cancer controls age 65 years and older
were selected from the 5% random sample of Medicare
enrolled beneficiaries. Non-cancer controls were frequency
matched on time of diagnosis in a 3:1 ratio to patients with
HCC. Random selection without replacement was used to
ensure that no non-cancer control was assigned to more than
one patient with HCC.
Risk factor information
Definitions of risk factors
We identified diabetes (ICD-9 code: 250), HBV (ICD-9 codes:
070.22, 070.23, 070.32, 070.33, V02.61), haemochromatosis
(ICD-9 code: 275.0), HCV, and alcoholic liver disease.21 HCV
was defined by the presence of ICD-9 codes for HCV (ICD-9
codes: 070.41, 070.44, 070.51, 070.54, V02.62) or unspecified
hepatitis (ICD-9 codes: 070.9, 571.4, 571.8, 571.9). Prior to
1992, a HCV specific ICD-9 code was not available; all
patients with HCV were classified as having unspecified
hepatitis. Alcoholic liver disease was defined by the presence
of ICD-9 codes for alcoholic fatty liver disease (ICD-9 code:
571.0), alcoholic hepatitis (ICD-9 code: 571.1), alcoholic
cirrhosis of the liver (ICD-9 code: 571.2), alcoholic liver
damage (ICD-9 code: 571.3), and cirrhosis (ICD-9 codes:
571.5, 571.6) in the presence of alcoholism (ICD-9 code: 291,
303, 305.0). Patients with HCC with none of these risk factors
(HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, haemochromatosis) were
denoted as idiopathic. We also examined other potential risk
factors including obesity (ICD-9 codes: 278.0, 259.9),
dyslipidaemia (ICD-9 codes: 272.0, 272.1, 272.2, 272.3,
272.4), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (ICD-9 codes:
042–044, V08), and non-specific cirrhosis. Non-specific
cirrhosis was defined as the presence of cirrhosis (ICD-9
codes: 571.5, 571.6) without the presence of HCV, HBV,
alcoholic liver disease, or haemochromatosis.
Risk factors were identified based on Medicare part A or B
claims for the three years preceding and two years succeeding
the date of HCC diagnosis or until death, with the exception
of diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidaemia. HCC cases and non￾cancer controls provided information for an equal number of
years for all risk factors. This time span was selected based on
a sensitivity analysis that demonstrated only a small increase
in the ability to identify more recorded risk factors among
HCC cases and non-cancer controls beyond this time period.
However, diabetes can potentially be caused by end stage
liver disease and therefore we did not consider a diagnosis of
diabetes that occurred after the index date of HCC diagnosis.
A diagnosis of obesity and dyslipidaemia that occurred after
their index date of diagnosis were also excluded because of
their association with diabetes. We assumed that all other
risk factors (HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, haemochro￾matosis, non-specific cirrhosis, and HIV) that were recorded
after the cancer diagnosis were acquired prior to the cancer
diagnosis. These risk factors were unlikely to be acquired late
in life or to be caused by HCC.
Demographic information
We collected information on age (,75, >75) sex (men,
women), race (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, other race),
geographical region (Utah, Atlanta, Connecticut, Detroit,
Hawaii, Iowa, Los Angeles, New Mexico, San Francisco, San
Jose, and Seattle) and Medicare/Medicaid dual enrolment.

third party payer, usually Medicaid, was paying for a
beneficiary’s Medicare part B premiums, and served as a
proxy for lower socioeconomic status. These individuals were
considered Medicare/Medicaid dually enrolled.
Statistical analysis
We compared the demographic features and prevalence of
major risk factors between patients with HCC and non-cancer
controls. Among patients with HCC, the proportions of
patients diagnosed by testing modality obtained from SEER
were calculated. We also examined the risk of HCC associated
with several other features of metabolic syndrome, including
hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary atherosclero￾sis, ischaemic heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease.
In addition, we compared demographic features and pre￾valence of risk factors associated with diabetes between HCC
patients with a major known risk factor (HCV, HBV, alcoholic
liver disease, haemochromatosis) with those with no risk
factors (idiopathic). x2 tests were conducted for categorical
variables and t tests for continuous variables.22 Unadjusted
odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), as well as
p values, were calculated for each variable. A sensitivity
analysis was performed in which diabetes was defined based
on diagnoses made between two and three years prior to the
date of HCC diagnosis.
Five separate multiple logistic regression models were
constructed to examine risk of HCC (v non-cancer controls)
with diabetes, HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, and
haemochromatosis.23 We tested for interactions between
diabetes and each of these risk factors. In addition, a model
restricted to patients without HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver
disease, and haemochromatosis was examined. All models
were adjusted for age, sex, race, SEER registry, and Medicare/
Medicaid dual enrolment. Wald x2 tests were used to
determine the significance of each variable. Adjusted
ORs and 95% CIs were calculated for each parameter
estimate.
RESULTS
We identified 3001 patients aged 65 years and older in the
SEER-Medicare database with HCC between 1994 and 1999.
Of these cases, 2061 patients with HCC satisfied our criteria
for inclusion in the study cohort. Patients were excluded for
enrolment in a Medicare HMO plan during the three years
prior to or following the date of HCC diagnosis (n = 742;
24.7%), enrolment in Medicare part A and part B for less than
three years prior to the index date (n = 114; 3.8%), diagnosis
of stomach, colon, lung, pancreatic, breast, or rectal cancer
within the five year period before the date of HCC diagnosis
(n = 58; 1.9%), and HCC reported only from autopsy or death
certificate (n = 26; 0.9%).
We identified 127 466 non-cancer controls aged 65 years
and older who were enrolled in Medicare between 1994 and
1999. The 36 632 non-cancer controls were excluded for the
following reasons: enrolment in a Medicare HMO plan
during the three years prior to randomly assigned index date
(n = 32 346; 25.4%) and enrolment in Medicare part A and
part B for less than three years prior to the randomly assigned
index date (n = 4286; 3.4%). Among the remaining eligible
non-cancer control group (n = 92 120), a total of 6183

non-cancer controls were frequency matched on the time of
diagnosis in a 3:1 ratio to patients with HCC.
Demographic features
Mean age in patients with HCC (76.1 (SD 5.9) years) and
non-cancer controls (76.4 (SD 6.9) years) was not signifi￾cantly different. However, patients with HCC were signifi￾cantly less likely to be female and of White race than non￾cancer controls. Several significant differences by SEER
registry were also observed between cases and controls
(table 1).
Among all testing modalities (histology, cytology, micro￾scopic confirmation (method not specified), laboratory test/
marker study, direct visualisation, or positive radiology tests),
the majority of patients with HCC were diagnosed by
histology (n = 1279; 62.1%), followed by cytology (n = 401;
19.4%), radiology (n = 314; 15.2%), laboratory test/marker
study (n = 55; 2.7%), microscopic confirmation (method not
specified) (n = 10; 0.5%), and direct visualisation (n = 2;
0.1%). These categories are constructed by SEER in a
hierarchical mutually exclusive fashion in the order shown
above. For example, the presence of positive histological
examination supersedes all other modalities, while positive
radiology diagnosis is considered only in the absence of all
diagnostic modalities.
Diabetes as a risk factor for HCC
We found that 43.3% of HCC patients and 19.4% of non￾cancer controls had diabetes, as defined by diagnoses
recorded during the three years preceding the date of HCC

diagnosis. When the definition of diabetes excluded diag￾noses made only within one year or two years preceding the
date of HCC diagnosis, the proportions of diabetes were
37.9% and 31.6% for HCC patients and 16.0% and 12.1% for
non-cancer controls. This analysis indicated that the sig￾nificant increase in the prevalence of diabetes among patients
with HCC and non-cancer controls is less likely to be a result
of HCC.
In the unadjusted analysis, diabetes was associated with a
threefold increase in the odds of HCC (table 1). Among HCC
patients with diabetes, 56.5% did not have any specific major
risk factors while 22.3% had HCV, 8.2% HBV, 24.2% alcoholic
liver disease, and 4.7% haemochromatosis (patients could
have multiple risk factors).
In the multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, sex, race,
geographic region, and Medicare/Medicaid dual enrolment,
the odds of HCC patients being diagnosed with diabetes
increased by almost threefold (tables 2, 3). The effect of
diabetes was tested after excluding patients with each risk
factor, as well as all patients with any of these risk factors.
The increase in the odds for HCC patients with diabetes
remained when the analysis was restricted to patients
without HCV (OR 2.99 (95% CI 2.64–3.40)), HBV (OR 3.11
(95% CI 2.76–3.50)), alcoholic liver disease (OR 2.94 (95% CI
2.59–3.34)), haemochromatosis (OR 3.08 (95% CI 2.73–
3.47)), or any of these risk factors (OR 2.87 (95% CI 2.49–
3.30)). A significant positive statistical interaction was found
between HCV and diabetes (p,0.0001). The combined
presence of HCV and diabetes was associated with a 37-fold
increase in HCC. There were no other significant interactions
among diabetes and other risk factors.
In these models, an increase in the odds of having HCC
was also associated with younger age, male sex, non-White
race, and having Medicare/Medicaid dual enrolment (table 3).
Significant positive interactions were found between diabetes
and age, sex, and race (p,0.0001) where the combined
presence of diabetes with each of older age, male sex, and
non-Caucasian race further increased the risk of HCC.
Other potential HCC risk factors
As expected, the proportions of HCC patients with HCV, HBV,
alcoholic liver disease, and haemochromatosis were signifi￾cantly greater compared with non-cancer controls (table 1).
Among patients with HCC, 43.3% had diabetes, 17.6% HCV,
8.8% HBV, 22.0% alcoholic liver disease, 3.3% haemochro￾matosis, and 0.3% HIV. Among non-cancer controls, 19.4%
had diabetes, 1.3% HCV, 0.2% HBV, 0.4% alcoholic liver
disease, 0.3% haemochromatosis, and 0.1% HIV.
In separate multiple logistic regression models examining
the association between risk of HCC and each of these risk
factors while adjusting for age, sex, race, geographical region,
and Medicare/Medicaid dual enrolment, patients with HCC
continued to be associated at a 24, 24, 70, and 9-fold
increased odds of HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, and
haemochromatosis, respectively, compared with non-cancer
controls (table 2).
Other features of metabolic syndrome as risk factors
for HCC
The proportions of HCC patients with hypertension, con￾gestive heart failure, coronary atherosclerosis, ischaemic
heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease were signifi￾cantly greater compared with non-cancer controls. Among
patients with HCC, 67.7% had hypertension, 38.9% conges￾tive heart failure, 25.6% coronary atherosclerosis, 20.3%
ischaemic heart disease, and 15.4% peripheral vascular

vascular disease. In univariate analyses examining the
association between risk of HCC and each of these features
of metabolic syndromes, congestive heart failure was
associated with the greatest risk of HCC (OR 2.80 (95% CI
2.56–3.07)) followed by hypertension (OR 2.16 (95% CI 2.16–
1.97)), ischaemic heart disease (OR 1.96 (95% CI 1.77–2.20)),
coronary atherosclerosis (OR 1.79 (95% CI 1.62–1.98)), and
peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.67 (95% CI 1.48–1.89)).
Comparison of patients with a known risk factor with
those with idiopathic HCC
Patients with idiopathic HCC were older and more likely to be
of White race but no significant gender differences were
observed (table 4). Idiopathic HCC constituted the majority
of patients in Utah (74.1%), Iowa (68.7%), Seattle (67.4%),
Detroit (63.5%), and New Mexico (62.0%). A lower propor￾tion of HCC patients with idiopathic disease were dually
enrolled in Medicare/Medicaid programmes compared with
patients with a known risk factor (24.5% v 31.0%). The
proportion of idiopathic HCC patients with non-specific
cirrhosis was significantly greater compared with HCC
patients with a known risk factor but the proportion of
idiopathic patients with diabetes was significant lower
compared with HCC patients with a known risk factor
(table 4). No significant differences were observed between
these groups for obesity or dyslipidaemia.
DISCUSSION
This is the first population based study to examine the
association between diabetes and HCC in the USA. We found
diabetes to be an independent risk factor for HCC, regardless
of the presence of HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, or non￾specific cirrhosis. In this study, diabetes was associated with
a 2–3-fold increase in the risk of HCC. Approximately 60% of
patients with HCC in this study did not have a recorded
diagnosis of HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, or haemo￾chromatosis; among these patients, 47% had diabetes, which
was even higher than those with other risk factors (41%).
This finding suggests that diabetes may account for a
significant proportion of patients with idiopathic HCC.
These results corroborate and extend findings from several
non-population based as well as non-US population based
studies that have identified diabetes as a risk factor for HCC.
One population based study using data obtained from the
Denmark cancer registry detected an increased risk of HCC
among patients with diabetes alone, as well as in the
presence of hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcohol related conditions,
and other liver disorders.13 Similarly, a study using the
Swedish inpatient registry also found a threefold risk of liver
cancer among patients hospitalised with diabetes, and a
fourfold risk in the presence of hepatitis, cirrhosis, and
alcoholism.15
We also found that diabetes in the presence of HCV, HBV,
alcoholic liver disease, and haemochromatosis increased the
risk of developing HCC beyond the risk associated with
diabetes in the absence of these risk factors. Although a
positive interaction between diabetes and these risk factors
could exist where the combination of risk factors act
synergistically to increase the risk of HCC, this finding
represents an increased risk of diabetes with these factors
either directly (for example, HCV) or through underlying
liver disease. In this study, the statistical evidence of
significant interaction was found only between diabetes
and HCV. Two previous non population based studies found
that diabetes increased the risk of liver cancer only in the
presence of hepatitis or cirrhosis.12 16
In this study, HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, and
haemochromatosis accounted for only approximately 40%
of HCC. This finding may indicate a limitation of the data
source but is similar to findings from previous studies
reporting that 20–50% of HCC patients in the USA have
idiopathic disease.3 4 24 Recent studies have suggested that
diabetes and/or NAFLD could account for at least a portion of
these ‘‘idiopathic’’ cases.12 15 Findings from this study support
this hypothesis; the presence of diabetes alone accounted for
approximately 32% of patients with idiopathic HCC.
Diabetes, as part of the insulin resistance syndrome, has
been implicated as a risk factor for NAFLD, including its most
severe form NASH. NASH has been identified as a cause of
both cryptogenic cirrhosis and HCC.5 6 One would expect that
patients at risk of developing NASH related HCC are more
likely to be older, female, of White race, and to have other
features of insulin resistance, such as obesity and dyslipi￾daemia. We observed a greater proportion of older as well as
White patients with idiopathic HCC. We also observed a
significantly greater proportion of idiopathic HCC cases in
geographical areas with predominately White populations
(for example, Utah (74% v 26%) and Iowa (69% v 31%))
compared with the remaining SEER regions. Lastly, we also
observed fewer idiopathic HCC patients with lower socio￾economic levels who are at higher risk of viral hepatitis and
alcoholic liver disease. On the other hand, we found no
significant association between idiopathic HCC and sex,
obesity, or dyslipidaemia.
Limitations of this study are related to the completeness
and accuracy of the information on risk factors in the SEER￾Medicare linked database. To maximise the possibility of
capturing risk factor information from claims data, we
searched for risk factor information for up to a five year
period (three years before and up to two years after HCC
diagnosis) for HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, and
haemochromatosis, and up to a three year time period prior
to HCC diagnosis for diabetes. The choice of this five year
time span was selected based on our sensitivity analysis that
demonstrated only a small increase in the ability to identify
more recorded risk factors among HCC cases and non-cancer
controls beyond this time period. For our analysis sample of
patients 65 years or older with continuous Medicare part A
and part B enrolment and no enrolment in an HMO plan,
Medicare files have been reported to capture 100% of their
Medicare claims for tests, procedures, outpatient visits, and
hospitalisation.19
Given the case control design and relatively limited time
frame for risk factor information, we could not investigate
the duration-response relationship between diabetes and
HCC. One study found that patients with a longer duration
since the onset of diabetes had a greater risk of developing
HCC compared with patients more recently diagnosed with
diabetes.12 We also cannot be completely certain that diabetes
in HCC patients did not develop as a consequence of
underlying liver disease.25 However, we took several steps to
limit and adjust for this possibility by considering only
diabetes related risk factor information prior to the date of
cancer diagnosis. In addition, we examined the prevalence of
diabetes excluding the one and two years prior to HCC
diagnosis and found no significant differences in the
prevalence of diabetes among patients with HCC.
Strengths of this study are related to its data source.
Firstly, the SEER registries are selected to represent the entire
US population, and therefore our overall findings should be
generalisable to the entire US population aged 65 years and
older.19 Secondly, we had complete ascertainment of patients
with HCC, which also facilitates the generalisability of our
results. The SEER programme maintains at least a 98%
completeness rate for case ascertainment. Thirdly, all cases of

HCC included in this analysis were confirmed by pathology,
radiology, and/or laboratory testing. Fourthly, we selected our
cohort to obtain complete Medicare claims data for all
patients with HCC and non-cancer controls thus minimising
the possibility of losing any recorded encounters with the
health care system. Lastly, there was no potential for recall
bias between cases and controls as all risk factor information
was based on diagnostic codes contained in the Medicare
claims files.
In conclusion, our results indicate that diabetes is
associated with an increased risk of HCC among persons
65 years and older, regardless of the presence of HCV, HBV,
alcoholic liver disease, haemochromatosis, or other under￾lying liver disease. Our findings also suggest that HCV could
potentially interact with diabetes to further increase the risk
of developing HCC. Further studies are needed to clarify the
role of diabetes on the progression of pre-existing major risk
factors, and how the presence of multiple risk factors with
diabetes affect the development of HCC.
