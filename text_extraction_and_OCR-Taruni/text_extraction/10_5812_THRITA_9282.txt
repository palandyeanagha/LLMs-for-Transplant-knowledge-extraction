Background: Diabetes type 1 has a variety of destructive effects on different parts of the body including kidney tissue. Diabetic nephropathy 
is among the serious complications of diabetes. Oxidative stress plays a central role in the development of diabetic nephropathy with 
glomeruli dilation.
Objectives: Due to the known anti-oxidant and anti-diabetic effects of Origanum majorana (OM), this study was conducted to survey its 
effects on oxidative stress and histopathology of renal tissue among diabetic rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental investigation, 32 male rats, weighing 200 - 250 g, were divided into four groups: 1: control, 
2: control receiving treatment with OM, 3: diabetic, and 4: diabetic receiving treatment with OM. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal 
injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Groups under treatment received food containing 6.25% of OM. Tissue levels of malondialdehyde 
(MDA) were measured to evaluate the oxidative stress. In addition, renal histopathology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H & 
E) staining. Data were analyzed using ANOVA.
Results: A significant increase in the renal tissue level of MDA was observed in diabetic and OM-treated diabetic groups versus control 
group (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively). OM treatment non-significantly reduced the tissue level of MDA (P = 0.11). Also, diabetes caused 
a significant increase in glomerular size compared to the control group (P = 0.03), and treatment of diabetic rats with OM caused a non￾significant decrease in glomerular size compared to the diabetic group (P = 0.17).
Conclusions: Taken together, long term treatment of diabetic rats with OM can partially protect the renal tissue via attenuation of 
oxidative stress and glomerular expansion.

1. Background
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder with chronic 
hyperglycemia and defects in carbohydrates, lipids and 
proteins metabolism (1). Chronic diabetes can lead to 
retinopathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular disorders. 
According to some reports, diabetes prevalence is in￾creasing worldwide (2-4). Presumably, one third to half of 
diabetic patients will finally develop diabetic nephropa￾thy which is the most important cause of morbidity and 
mortality among diabetics. Mortality rate among pa￾tients with diabetic nephropathy is 30 times more than 
diabetic patients without nephropathy (5). Diabetes mel￾litus also has a close relation with oxidative stress due to 
the increased formation of oxygen free radicals. Different 
studies have shown that hyperglycemia is related to in￾creased oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress has a 
pivotal role in the renal damage of patients with diabetes 
(6-8). Increased tissue level of malondialdehyde (MDA) is 
one of the important markers of oxidative stress (8, 9). 
Moreover, one of the complications of diabetic nephrop￾athy is distention and destruction of glomeruli in the re￾nal tissue (10).
Because of the low accessibility and high expenses of 
most of the new therapies, finding new agents with less 
side effects such as herbal derivatives is further high￾lighted (11). One of these herbal plants is Organium vulgar￾ea ssp.viridie (Origanum majorana). Investigations have 
shown that Origanum majorana (OM) can decrease blood 
glucose level in diabetic rats (12). Also its long term pre￾scription hampered streptozotocin-induced diabetes tis￾DOI: 10.5812/thrita.9282

sue injuries (13). OM supplement is a modulator of tissue 
lipid peroxidation and is considered as an anti-oxidant in 
colon cancer with probable anti-cancer effects (14). With 
an increase in predisposing factors like obesity, seden￾tary life style, low body movements and inappropriate 
diets, a precise programming seems essential to manage 
the disease (15, 16).
2. Objectives
Due to the known anti-oxidant and anti-diabetic prop￾erties of this herb, we conducted this study to investigate 
the effects of Origanum majorana on renal histopathology 
and oxidative stress in diabetic rats.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Animals
This experimental investigation was performed on 
32 three-month-old male albino Wistar rats weighing 
200 to 250 g (Razi Institute). Animals were kept at a 
standard temperature of 21 - 23°C on a 12/12 light dark 
cycle with an appropriate air conditioning. All 32 rats 
were in 4 groups including: 1, control; 2, control given 
food containing OM powder; 3, diabetic; 4, diabetic giv￾en food containing OM powder. Four rats were kept in 
each cage. At the first stage, rats were fed for one week 
for accommodation with the lab environment. Animals 
were provided with food and water without any limita￾tion. This study was performed according to the Ameri￾can National Health Institute (NIH) guidelines and also 
available local manuals for keeping and working with 
animals. Rats with serum glucose levels below 130 mg/
dL were selected. Blood sampling was performed using 
a capillary tube from the retro-orbital plexus after over￾night fasting in normal conditions. Sample volume was 
about 1 ml. For induction of diabetes, streptozotocin 
(STZ) (Sigma, Germany) dissolved in cold physiologic 
saline was injected intraperitoneally (60 mg/kg). After 
one week post-injection, diabetes verification was done 
using dipstick (Glucoyab co., Tehran). Only animals with 
urine glucose levels of more than 50 which equals to the 
glucose level of 250 in plasma were qualified for the next 
step. Moreover, some symptoms like polyphagia, poly￾dipsia, diuresis and gradual weight loss were indicators 
of diabetes induction in rats. After three weeks, all rats 
were weighed and blood sampling was performed. Six 
weeks after initiation of the investigation, final weigh￾ing and blood sampling were performed. Serum glucose 
level was measured with glucose oxidase enzyme meth￾od (Zistchemi, Tehran) using spectrophotometer with 
the following formula:
Standard absorption × 100/test absorption = glucose 
(mg/dL)
3.2. Preparation of OM Powder
The plant leaves were prepared and the identification 
was approved by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical 
Sciences Biology Department. Leaves were grinded. Then 
the powder was mixed with the standard rats’ food with 
a proportion of 6.25%. Adequate water was added to the 
mixture and the pasta was formed in a shape available 
for consumption. Then it was dried for 24 hours with 
sunlight, and was provided in cages with water without 
any limitation.
3.3. Determination of Renal Malondialdehyde 
(MDA) Concentration
Rats were anesthetized with diethyl ether (100 mg/kg) 
(Merck, Germany), decapitated, kidneys were removed, 
blotted dry, weighed, then made into 5% tissue homog￾enate in ice-cold 0.9% saline solution, centrifuged (1000 
× g, 4ºC, 10 min), and obtained supernatant was liquated 
and stored at -80°C until assayed. In order to measure 
the MDA concentration (thiobarbituric acid reactive sub￾stances, TBARS) in the supernatant, trichloroacetic acid 
and TBARS reagent were added to the supernatant, then 
mixed and incubated at 100ºC for 80 min. After cooling 
on ice, samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min 
and the absorbance of the supernatant was read at 532 
nm. TBARS results were expressed as MDA equivalents us￾ing tetraethoxypropane as standard (17).
3.4. Protein Assay
The protein content of the supernatant was measured 
with Bradford method using bovine serum albumin (Sig￾ma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) as the standard (Bradford, 
1976) (17).
3.5. Histological Assessment
Kidneys were resected and put into 10% formalin (10, 
18). After 24 hours, the fixator solution was changed. Af￾ter processing, 5 µm sections were prepared using rotary 
microtome and sections were transferred into gelatin 
slides. For evaluation of sections, hematoxylin and eo￾sin (H & E) staining was done (Ziess, Germany). In each 
group, at least 100 glomeruli (20 glomeruli from each 
rat) were observed and evaluated (10) by a pathologist 
who was blinded to the treatments.
3.6. Statistical Analysis
Results were reported as averages and standard devia￾tions. After determining data distribution, one way ANO￾VA was used for analysis of the histological data. Other pa￾rameters were assessed using repeated measure ANOVA 
and Tukey’s post-test. P value less than 0.05 was consid￾ered significant for all analyses.

4. Results
4.1. Weight of Rats
Thirty two male Wistar rats were used for the study. Ani￾mal weights were measured one week before the evalu￾ation as well as three and six weeks after evaluation. Re￾sults showed that weight does not show any significant 
difference one week before evaluations in all groups, 
while there was a significant difference among groups 
after three and six weeks. After six weeks, diabetic group 
showed a significant reduction in weight compared to 
the control group. Although this decrease was also ob￾served after three weeks, it was not significant. Moreover, 
difference was not significant after three and six weeks 
between the two groups of diabetic and diabetic under 
treatment with OM. Although body weight was higher 
in diabetic group receiving treatment compared to dia￾betic group without treatment after three and six weeks, 
the observed difference was not significant. In addition, 
treatment of control group with OM resulted in a signifi￾cant difference compared to control group without treat￾ment and weight was less than control group (Figure 1).

4.2. Serum Glucose Level
Assessing the serum level of glucose, no significant dif￾ferences were found among the groups at the beginning 
of the study. Moreover, the serum level of glucose of the 
diabetic and OM-treated diabetic group were consider￾ably higher compared to the primary measures at the 
beginning of the study. Also, the control group with OM 
did not show a significant difference in comparison with 
the control group. In addition, an insignificant drop of 
serum level of glucose was documented in the diabetic 
rats receiving treatment compared to the diabetic group 
(Figure 2).

Regarding renal lipid peroxidation marker, treatment 
with OM in control group did not produce any significant 
change versus untreated control group. In contrast, STZ￾induced diabetes resulted in significant elevation of MDA 
content compared to the control group (P = 0.009), and 
treatment with OM in diabetic group caused a significant 
reduction of MDA level (P = 0.03) versus untreated dia￾betics. Meanwhile, OM-treated diabetics did not show a 
significant elevation of MDA content in comparison with 
control group (Figure 3).

4.4. Kidney Histopathology
Staining of the renal tissue showed that the glomeruli 
of the control group were morphologically normal and 
that the treatment of the control group with OM did 
not have a clear effect on the structure of the glomeruli. 
Meanwhile, the glomeruli from the diabetic rats had ex￾pansion and dispersion after six weeks, even though such 
alterations were yet statistically non-significant. Also, the 
treatment of the diabetic group with OM non-significant￾ly reduced glomerular size with a more regular pattern 
(Figure 4) (Table 1).

5. Discussion
The results of this experiment showed that treatment of 
the diabetic group with OM does not increase the weight 
of the diabetic rats, nor does it reduce the serum level of 
glucose in any significant way. Diabetic rats showed a sig￾nificant rise in the levels of malondialdehyde in the renal 
tissue which was significantly reduced after treatment 
with OM. Furthermore, undergoing treatment with OM 
for the diabetic rats showed a non-significant reduction 
of the glomeruli size and their irregularity in shape and 
pathological expansion.
Reports of the previous experimentations show that in 
both diabetes insipidus and mellitus (respectively type 1 
and 2), the occurrence of oxidative stress rises due to in￾creased levels of oxygen free radicals and that the body’s 
anti-oxidative capabilities are somewhat diminished 
which is the main cause of tissue damage in diabetic pa￾tients (7, 8). The activities of anti-oxidative agents in the 
body play a major role in the upkeep of cells against in￾ternal and external toxic free radicals (8, 19). The STZ-in￾duced diabetes can result in lowered levels of activities of 
endogenous anti-oxidative enzymes and subsequent tis￾sue degradations (8). In time, the occurrence of oxidative 
stress and lipid peroxidation is imminent in the diabetic 
patient, for which the best marker would be the tissue lev￾els of MDA (20). Moreover, chronic hyperglycemia affects 
the renal tissue, either by direct effect or indirect induc￾tion of the damage through hemodynamic alterations, 
while in such situations, hyperfilteration and microalbu￾minuria play the most important roles. Such alterations 
will affect the adjacent resident cells into an abnormal 
production of cytokines and growth factors which will 
subsequently facilitate the synthesis of extracellular ma￾trix proteins and the depositions in the glomerular level. 
Such events will eventually lead to mesangial expansion 
and glomerular basement thickening (10).
 It has been previously reported that OM can act in 
many ways to stack up the free radicals of oxygen (i.e. 
superoxide), protect the cell against harmful chemi￾cal substances (i.e. environmental toxins), reduce lipid 
peroxidation and protect the liver against a variety of 
chemically-induced stresses, which can be attributed to 
its high values of anti-oxidants like flavonoids (21, 22). To 
this, consumption of this herb can lead to protection of 
the body’s tissues against the aforementioned harms (22) 
in the healthy person and the diabetic patient who expe￾rience the occurrence of oxidative stress more (20) and 
show the consequent biochemical changes in the serum. 
In addition, flavonoids of this herb may balance the enzy￾matic activities of the liver such ways as to help balance 
the levels of hormones in the metabolism pathway of 
carbohydrates like reduction of hepatic phosphorylase 
and increasing glucokinase and glycogen synthetase, 
which will in turn, lower the serum level of glucose and 
maintain a healthy body weight (23). Trials regarding OM 
have shown that administering the extract of this herb 
in healthy and diabetic rats will cause a drop in serum 
glucose levels within six hours of administration, and 
repeated daily administration will result in a normal 
serum glucose level (12); though such allegations are in￾consistent with our findings in this trial. This contrast 
might be partially explained by the fact that diabetes has 
been chemically induced with a cytotoxic substance in 
our rats, which will cause a more severe set of biochemi￾cal effects. Accordingly, the serum level of insulin and 
the number of insulin-producing cells would reduce to 

Ghosian.Moghaddam M et al.

an absolute minimum. Furthermore, in another study, 
the anti-diabetic properties of OM had been confirmed. 
The results of this study showed that long-term admin￾istration of OM will withhold the organ and tissue dam￾age and this treatment does not affect the serum levels of 
glucose among animals (13); again, such allegations are 
inconsistent with our findings.
In our study, the increase in renal tissue levels of MDA 
was documented and oral administration of OM resulted 
in decreasing the levels of oxidative stress markers in the 
renal tissue. Correspondingly, some positive attributes of 
OM in this study may be the ability to lower the oxidative 
stress. On this matter, it was shown that some flavonoids 
can boost the activity of some free-radical-fighting mech￾anisms of anti-oxidants and enzymes (24). Accordingly, 
flavonoids can lower the occurrence of lipid peroxida￾tion as well (25), which can lead to lower levels of MDA in 
the renal tissue.
Some inconsistencies with other studies can be attrib￾uted to the varying dosages of administration of OM, con￾sidering that our dosages have been closer to the mini￾mum effective dosage in the diet of the subjects. Also, 
another cause may be the route of OM administration 
which was oral in this study. Lower consumed amounts 
mean lower levels of entry in the blood. We recommend 
re-assessing the ability of OM in lowering the serum glu￾cose levels and its antioxidant properties with different 
administration routes or higher dosages. One of our 
limitations was that we did not measure the Glomerular 
Filtration Rate (GFR), and we recommend similar stud￾ies with GFR measurement to assess the effects of OM on 
physiological functions of the glomeruli.
