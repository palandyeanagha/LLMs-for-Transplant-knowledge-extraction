Neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (Ngal), also known as siderocalin, forms a complex with iron￾binding siderophores (Ngal:siderophore:Fe). This complex converts renal progenitors into epithelial tubules. 
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Ngal:siderophore:Fe protects adult kidney epithelial cells or 
accelerates their recovery from damage. Using a mouse model of severe renal failure, ischemia-reperfusion 
injury, we show that a single dose of Ngal (10 μg), introduced during the initial phase of the disease, dramatically 
protects the kidney and mitigates azotemia. Ngal activity depends on delivery of the protein and its siderophore 
to the proximal tubule. Iron must also be delivered, since blockade of the siderophore with gallium inhibits 
the rescue from ischemia. The Ngal:siderophore:Fe complex upregulates heme oxygenase-1, a protective 
enzyme, preserves proximal tubule N-cadherin, and inhibits cell death. Because mouse urine contains an Ngal￾dependent siderophore-like activity, endogenous Ngal might also play a protective role. Indeed, Ngal is highly 
accumulated in the human kidney cortical tubules and in the blood and urine after nephrotoxic and ischemic 
injury. We reveal what we believe to be a novel pathway of iron traffic that is activated in human and mouse 
renal diseases, and it provides a unique method for their treatment.
Introduction
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a syndrome characterized by loss 
of function and death of the proximal tubule of the kidney (1–3). 
The syndrome is induced by the accumulation of low–molecular 
weight molecules such as pharmaceuticals, by proteins filtered 
from the glomerulus, or by hypoxia followed by reperfusion.
A mechanism that may underlie each of these inciting factors is 
mislocalized iron. Unbound iron can catalyze the conversion of 
H2O2 to OH and OH– (the Haber-Weiss reaction) or form reactive 
ferryl or perferryl species (4). These ions mutagenize many types of 
molecules, including lipids, nucleotides, and the DNA backbone 
(5, 6). Catalytic iron in urine or blood and peroxidized lipids have 
been documented in acute renal failure mediated by hemoglobin 
and myoglobin (7), chemotherapy (cisplatin, ref. 8; doxorubicin, 
ref. 9), ischemia-reperfusion (10, 11), transplant ischemia (12), 
and proteinuria induced tubular damage (13). Preloading animals 
with iron (14) worsens the disease, and, conversely, chelating iron 
with deferoxamine (DFO) (8, 15–19) or bacterial siderophores (20) 
blunts the damage. Iron-catalyzed damage is thought to be one of 
the earliest events in kidney dysfunction and is likely to be impor￾tant in other organs, including the heart (20) and the liver (21).
Cells acquire iron from carrier proteins (transferrin) or from 
cell surface iron transporters (divalent metal transporter) (1, 22). 
Intracellular iron is controlled by the actions of the iron-respon￾sive proteins (IRPs 1 and 2) (23–26), the ferritin complex (27–30), 
and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (31). Because IRPs are modulated by 
hypoxia (32), oxidative stress (33, 34), and phosphorylation (35), 
changes in their activity may play an important role in ischemic 
disease, particularly by regulating the expression of ferritin (36–38). 
However, few other aspects of iron trafficking, storage, or metabo￾lism are known in ischemic cells or in other types of tissue damage, 
despite the primacy of catalytic iron in their pathogenesis.
We recently identified a protein that induced the conversion 
of rat kidney progenitors into epithelia, tubules, and complete 
nephrons. The protein is called neutrophil gelatinase–associated 
lipocalin (Ngal) or lipocalin 2 (39), a member of the lipocalin 
superfamily. These proteins are composed of 8 β-strands that form 
a β-barrel enclosing a calyx (40). The calyx binds and transports 
low–molecular weight chemicals. The best evidence for Ngal’s 
ligand comes from crystallographic studies that demonstrated a 
bacterial siderophore (enterochelin) in the calyx (41). Ngal binds 
the siderophore with high affinity (0.4 nM), and the siderophore 
traps iron with high affinity (10–49 M) (42). The stoichiometry of 
protein:siderophore:Fe is 1:1:1, as demonstrated by binding stud￾ies and x-ray crystallography (41). When the siderophore was load￾ed with iron, the Ngal complex could donate iron to cell lines and 
to embryonic mesenchyme in vitro, and when the siderophore was 
iron free, the Ngal complex could chelate iron (39, 43). In many 
types of cells, Ngal trafficked to a late endosomal compartment

that differed from the transferrin compartment (39). Because Ngal 
is the first mammalian protein found to bind and transport a bac￾terial siderophore, it has been renamed siderocalin (41).
The current work was prompted by our recent finding that 
Ngal is one of the most highly expressed messages and proteins 
in the mouse kidney after ischemia-reperfusion injury (ATN) (44, 
45). Here we find that Ngal protein accumulates in the proximal 
tubule of human kidneys after ischemic and toxic ATN, just as in 
the mouse. To determine whether Ngal is protective, we injected 
mice with microgram quantities of the protein and found dramat￾ic preservation of kidney histology, as well as normalized serum 
creatinine. The mechanism of protection required the delivery of 
siderophore:Fe to the proximal tubule.
Results
Expression of Ngal in ATN of the human. Acute renal failure in humans 
was marked by log-order elevations in the concentration of serum 
and urinary Ngal protein. Compared with the Ngal concentration in 
normal serum (21 ng/ml geometric mean; n = 5) and normal urine 
(22 ng/ml; n = 10), serum Ngal was elevated 7.3-fold (146 ng/ml; 
P < 0.05; Figure 1) and urinary Ngal was elevated 25-fold (557 ng/ml; 
P < 0.001) in our patients with ATN, the most typical form of acute 
renal failure. Patients with ATN associated with bacterial infection 
tended to have the highest levels of serum Ngal (331 ng/ml) and uri￾nary Ngal (2,786 ng/ml), but this was not statistically different from 
ATN without infection. To determine whether Ngal expression cor￾related with the extent of acute renal impairment, we used simple 
regression analysis after log transformation of Ngal levels. We found 
that both serum Ngal (r = 0.64, n = 32) and urinary Ngal (r = 0.68,
n = 38), as well as urinary Ngal normalized for urinary creatinine
(r = 0.67, n = 36), were highly correlated with serum creatinine levels 
(P < 0.0001 each). In comparison, patients with chronic renal failure
had less prominent elevations in serum Ngal (49 ng/ml; n = 10) 
and urinary Ngal (119 ng/ml; n = 9), and these values were not pro￾portional to serum creatinine. These data correlate Ngal expression 
with acute kidney damage, implicating the kidney as the major 
source of serum and urinary Ngal. Indeed, in several cases of severe 
renal failure, the fractional excretion of Ngal (the clearance of Ngal,

recognized recombinant (21-kDa) and native (25-kDa) human and mouse Ngal. Occasionally, higher–molecular weight species (approximately 
35 kDa and 66 kDa) were present in recombinant and native preparations; these might represent dimers and trimers of Ngal. A standard curve 
was constructed with 25, 5, 1, and 0.2 ng recombinant proteins on nonreducing gels. Human urine samples (0.1–20 μl) from patients with ATN 
showed high levels of Ngal, whereas samples from patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), patients with liver cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, or 
pancreatic carcinoma but lacking a renal diagnosis (Others), or normal subjects (Normal) had low levels of Ngal. (B) Similar data were obtained 
from human serum. (C and D) Geometric means (bar ± SD) of urinary (C) and serum (D) Ngal were compared in normal, CRF, and ATN groups.

by immunoblot (5 μl/lane).

normalized for the clearance of creatinine) was greater than 100%, 
demonstrating that urinary Ngal derived from local synthesis, rath￾er than only from filtration from the blood.
To visualize Ngal protein, we immunostained human samples 
with affinity-purified anti-Ngal polyclonal antibody (Figure 2). The 
normal kidney demonstrated weak staining in the distal tubular 
epithelia (mean 10% of cortical area) and in the medullary collect￾ing ducts, implicating these tubules as the site of synthesis in the 
normal kidney. Only rare staining of glomerular parietal epithelial 
cells, but not other glomerular cells, was also identified. Proximal 
tubules were entirely negative in normal kidneys. In contrast, near￾ly 50% of cortical tubules, including proximal tubules, were Ngal+
in ischemic or nephrotoxin-damaged kidneys (Figure 2). Prolifera￾tive glomerulopathies also generated Ngal+ cortical tubules, but 
the intensity of staining and the percentage of the cortical paren￾chyma that were affected were much less than in ischemic disease 
(Ngal+ cortical parenchyma: 20% in minimal-change disease, 40% 
in diabetic nephropathy, 50% in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic anti￾body–associated glomerulonephritis, and 65% in anti–glomerular 
basement membrane disease); in these cases Ngal perhaps reflects 
a mild degree of tubular damage by proteinuria or hemodynamic 
change. Those tubular cells displaying the most obvious features of 
cell injury, including simplification and enlarged reparative nuclei 
with prominent nucleoli, had the most intense staining. Tubular 
cells with less derangement had much less staining. These data 
demonstrate de novo and widespread Ngal reactivity in cortical 
tubules of different renal diseases, suggesting that Ngal is a com￾mon and sensitive response to tubular injury.
Exogenous Ngal rescues the mouse proximal tubule from ATN. To exam￾ine the functional significance of Ngal expression in renal isch￾emia, we first reproduced a common model of renal damage (44, 
46) but used mice. The renal pedicle was clamped for 30 minutes, 
and the contralateral kidney was removed. Twenty-four hours after 
reperfusion, the plasma creatinine rose from 0.41 ± 0.10 mg/dl 
(n = 4) to 3.16 ± 0.17 mg/dl (n = 8, P < 0.001), and Ngal message and 
protein were intensely expressed. Ngal message rose approximately 
1,000-fold, reducing the threshold for detection by real-time RT￾PCR from 17.7 ± 0.9 cycles in sham-operated kidneys to 7.5 ± 0.4 
cycles in ischemic kidneys (normalized to β-actin, ΔCT; n = 4 each, 
P < 0.0001). Ngal protein rose 1,000-fold in the urine (40 μg/ml in 
ATN compared with 40 ng/ml in the sham-operated and normal 
mouse; Figure 1E) and 300-fold in the blood (30 μg/ml in ATN 
compared with 100 ng/ml in the sham-operated mouse) and was 
elevated close to 100-fold in kidney extracts (73 ± 7 μg/g compared 
with <1 μg/g kidney wet weight in sham-operated kidneys; n = 3 
each, P < 0.05). Renal Ngal protein correlated well with the duration 
of cross-clamping.
Prior work showed that Ngal appeared in the urine a number of 
hours after ischemia-reperfusion injury (44). To determine whether 
Ngal protein was protective, we introduced Ngal systemically (1–300 
μg by s.c. or i.p. injection) in the early stages of ATN. Introduction of 
100 μg Ngal 15 minutes before clamping blocked the rise in plasma 
creatinine measured 24 hours after reperfusion (1.18 ± 0.18 mg/dl 
in Ngal-treated mice, n = 7, compared with 3.16 ± 0.17 mg/dl in 
untreated animals, n = 8; P < 0.001). Similar data were obtained for 
dosages ranging from 10 to 300 μg of Ngal, but 1 μg Ngal was not 
protective (creatinine 3.09 ± 0.11 mg/dl; n = 3). Introduction of Ngal 
1 hour after reperfusion also blocked the azotemia (creatinine 
1.60 ± 0.28 mg/dl; n = 3, P < 0.001), but to a lesser degree than pre￾treatment with Ngal. In contrast to these studies, treatment with 
Ngal 2 hours after ischemia had no protective effect (creatinine 
3.12 ± 0.35 mg/dl; n = 3). The data were confirmed by measure￾ment of the blood urea nitrogen (data not shown).
The protective activity of Ngal was equally measurable by histol￾ogy (Figure 3): rather than necrotic tubules and luminal debris, 
normal epithelial morphology was preserved in the S1 and S2 seg￾ments of the proximal tubule. The S3 segment in the outer stripe 
of the outer medulla, however, was less protected by injection of 
Ngal, but tubular casts were also less evident at this site (Figure 
3B). These observations were supported by scoring of the sections 
on the Jablonski scale (47) (Figure 3C).
Correlates of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Because the trafficking and 
metabolism of the cadherins are rapidly affected by ischemia (48), 
and because Ngal acts as an inducer of E-cadherin in rat embryonic 
metanephric mesenchyme (39), we hypothesized that Ngal rescues

tubules. Staining was heterogeneous and most intense in epithelial 
cells that displayed histologic features of cell injury, including simplifi￾cation and enlarged reparative nuclei and prominent nucleoli. (J and

cadherin expression in the ischemic kidney. To test this hypothesis, 
we first confirmed that, whereas E-cadherin could be detected at 
a low level in the mouse proximal tubule by immunofluorescence, 
N-cadherin was specific to the proximal tubule and appeared to be 
its major cadherin (46) (Figure 4). N-cadherin is known to be pro￾cessed by caspases, by γ-secretase, and by MMPs, which generate 
30- to 40-kDa cytoplasmic fragments that are potentially impor￾tant signaling molecules that modulate CREB signaling (49). We 
found that, after ischemia-reperfusion, N-cadherin was degraded 
to fragments (Figure 4, A and B). In some animals degradation of 
the protein could be detected within 6 hours of reperfusion, and 
by 24 hours, both N-cadherin immunofluorescence and expression 
of the full-length protein were nearly abolished. In contrast, pre￾treatment with Ngal preserved N-cadherin immunofluorescence, 
enhanced the expression of full-length N-cadherin, and reduced 
the appearance of its fragment at 6 hours (in some animals) or 24 
hours of reperfusion. E-cadherin, on the other hand, was highly 
expressed in the distal tubule and collecting duct and was much 
less affected by ischemia and by Ngal treatment. Similarly, metal￾induced nephrotoxic ATN triggered the degradation of N-cadherin 
but not E-cadherin (50, 51). Perhaps Ngal directly modulates 
N-cadherin processing, but an indirect effect subsequent to the 
preservation of tubular morphology by Ngal is more likely.
Because the expression of Ngal correlates with ischemic damage 
(44), we examined the expression of endogenous Ngal mRNA after 
treatment with exogenous Ngal protein. We found that treatment 
of ischemic animals with Ngal (100 μg) reduced the increase in 
endogenous Ngal RNA by 72% ± 16% (n = 5, P < 0.01) at 24 hours 
of reperfusion as measured by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, the 
injection of Ngal reduced the appearance of Ngal protein in the 
kidney by 60% ± 10% (ischemia 73 ± 7 μg/g, Ngal-treated ischemia 
29 ± 7 μg/g; n = 3 each, P < 0.01) as measured by immunoblot.
Because disruption of the proximal cell results in apoptotic cell 
death, we next examined the effect of Ngal on cell viability (Figure 
4, C and D). Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, we counted the 
percentage of tubules with at least 1 TUNEL+ tubular cell. Isch￾emic kidneys showed that 11.5% ± 0.6% (n = 4) of cortical tubules 
contained TUNEL+ cells, but after treatment with Ngal, the per￾centage of positive tubules fell to 2.9% ± 0.9% (n = 7, P < 0.001). 
For comparison, 0.5% ± 0.3% of cortical tubules had TUNEL+ cells 
in sham-operated kidneys. Similarly, we evaluated the uptake of 
BrdU, a cell proliferation marker. We counted the percentage of 
cortical tubules with at least 1 BrdU+ tubular cell. Twenty-four 
hours after the insult, ischemic cortical tubules contained rare 
BrdU+ cells (1.9% ± 0.3% of tubules; n = 3), while ischemic kidneys 
pretreated with Ngal had a small but significant increase in posi￾tive cells (3.9% ± 0.5% of tubules; n = 4, P < 0.05). For comparison, 
3.7% ± 0.7% of cortical tubules had BrdU+ cells in sham-operated 
kidneys. Hence, rescue by Ngal reduced apoptosis of cortical cells 
and either stimulated compensatory tubular cell proliferation or 
else preserved tubular cells with proliferation potential.
Mechanism of rescue from ATN: Ngal targets the proximal tubule. To 
determine the mechanism by which Ngal protects the proximal 
tubule from ischemic damage, we first studied the distribution of 
exogenous Ngal after an i.p. or s.c. injection. Ngal was found in 
the urine within 10 minutes of injection (10 or 100 μg), suggest￾ing that the protein was rapidly cleared by the kidney (Figure 5). 
However, only 0.1–0.2% of the injected Ngal was recovered in the 
urine in the first hour. To better follow trafficking, we used fluo￾rescent conjugates of Ngal. Both fluorescein-labeled and Alexa￾labeled Ngal localized to large vesicles in the subapical domain of 
the cortical proximal tubule (S1 and S2 segments of the nephron) 
by 1 hour (Figure 6), but not to other segments of the tubule. To 
determine whether these organelles were lysosomes, we labeled 
proximal tubular lysosomes with fluorescein-dextran (43 kDa) the 
day before administration of Alexa 568–Ngal (52). One hour after 
injection of Ngal, 33% of the Ngal vesicles also contained dextran 
(Figure 6B). In addition, many of these vesicles costained with the 
lysosomal marker LAMP1 (data not shown). We obtained similar 
data by injecting 125I-Ngal (Figure 6C), which showed that the full￾Figure 3

length protein was rapidly cleared from the blood and located in 
the kidney by the 1-hour time point (for example, the kidney had 
13-fold more 125I-Ngal than the liver, per milligram protein). Near￾ly identical data were previously reported with human Ngal, which 
rapidly cleared the circulation (t1/2 = 10 minutes) and located in 
the kidney (the kidney had 12-fold more human 125I-Ngal than 
the liver, per milligram protein) (53). The kidney-localized protein 
was trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitable (70%) and was com￾posed of both full-length Ngal and a specific 14-kDa degradation 
product. These species persisted and were only slowly lost from 
the kidney. In contrast, the plasma and, particularly, the urine con￾tained mostly low–molecular weight, TCA-soluble 125I fragments 
(35% and 20% TCA precipitable, respectively; Figure 6).
These data show that full-length Ngal is rapidly cleared by the 
proximal tubule, where it traffics to lysosomes and degrades to a 
14-kDa fragment. It is likely that the endogenous protein (low levels 
of serum Ngal) traffics in a similar manner, because there is very 
little urinary Ngal in normal mouse or human urine, despite the fact 
that it is freely filtered from the circulation (human: filtered load = 
21 ng/ml × GFR, whereas urinary Ngal = 22 ng/ml; mouse: filtered 
load = 100 ng/ml × GFR, whereas urinary Ngal = 40 ng/ml).
Rescue of the proximal tubule from ATN requires siderophore:Fe. 
X-ray crystallography and atomic absorption as well as biochemi￾cal studies have demonstrated that Ngal cloned in XL1-Blue bac￾teria contains a siderophore called enterochelin, and that the 
siderophore carries iron in a 1:1 stoichiometry (41, 42). To deter￾mine whether Ngal can deliver iron to the proximal tubule, we 
prepared 55Fe-loaded Ngal by incubating iron-free Ngal:entero￾chelin with 55Fe at a 1:1 stoichiometry (Ngal:enterochelin:55Fe). 
One hour after injecting this labeled protein (10 μg i.p.), we 
recovered the majority of 55Fe in the kidney (55%), but only trace 
amounts in the plasma (4.3%), urine (0.6%), liver (2.4%,), and 
spleen (0.2%). To determine the location of the 55Fe in the kidney, 
we performed radioautography and found 55Fe in the proximal 
tubule, particularly along the apical surface, beneath the brush 
border (Figure 6E; Table 1). In contrast, 55Fe was not found in the 
medulla (Figure 6D). These data show that both the Ngal protein 
and its ligand, iron, can be captured by the proximal tubule when 
the complex is given exogenously. It should be noted that the 
distribution of Ngal:enterochelin:55Fe was quite different from 
the distribution of non–protein-bound 55Fe citrate (where kidney 
recovery was only 2.8%; ref. 54).
To determine the role of iron delivery in renal protection, we 
compared iron-loaded and iron-free Ngal. Ngal cloned in XL1-
Blue contains enterochelin and is iron loaded, and this form of 
Ngal protected the kidney (holo-Ngal; Figure 7A). In contrast, 
Ngal cloned in BL21 bacteria does not contain enterochelin 
and is not iron loaded (apo-Ngal) (41), and it only partially pro￾tected the kidney; this suggests that the siderophore:Fe was the 
critical factor (Figure 7A). To test this hypothesis further, we

reconstituted apo-Ngal (from BL21) with iron-saturated entero￾chelin (red protein, Figure 7B). In contrast to apo-Ngal, Ngal:
enterochelin:Fe enhanced the protection of the kidney and blunt￾ed the rise in serum creatinine. These data suggest that Ngal pro￾vides protection against ischemia by delivering siderophore:Fe 
to proximal tubules.
Because the iron-loaded form of Ngal contains 2 ligands (iron 
and enterochelin), we wished to identify the effective molecule 
by designing an experiment whereby Ngal:enterochelin could be 
delivered to the kidney without iron. However, we realized that 
iron-free Ngal:enterochelin is not likely to arrive in the proximal 
tubule without iron, because of the great avidity of the siderophore 
(10–49 M) (41), which allows it to strip iron from transferrin (55). 
Furthermore, when we loaded a mouse with 55FeCl and then intro￾duced iron-free Ngal:enterochelin (100 μg/0.05 ml PBS) 5 and 35 
minutes after the dose of iron, we found that the recovery of 55Fe at 
65 minutes increased 3-fold (percentage initial dose) from the kid￾ney and urine and decreased threefold from the liver and spleen, 
compared with that in mice receiving PBS. These data indicate 
that Ngal:enterochelin and Ngal:enterochelin:Fe are equivalent 
after introduction in vivo, supporting the view that Ngal:sidero￾phore acts as an iron delivery protein. Indeed, we found that the 
iron-free form of Ngal:enterochelin (white protein, Figure 7B) was 
as effective in vivo as the iron-loaded form (Figure 7A).
To test the role of Ngal ligands further, we prepared gallium￾complexed Ngal. Because gallium is a metal+3 that occupies iron￾binding sites with high affinity, including enterochelin, but can￾not undergo redox reactions typical of iron, gallium acts as an 
iron antagonist. In contrast to the iron complex, mice treated 15 
minutes before ischemia with Ngal:enterochelin:gallium were not 
protected (creatinine 3.17 ± 0.1 mg/dl; n = 4; Figure 7A). These data 
suggest that not only does Ngal transport iron, but iron transport 
is necessary for its activity.
It should be noted that protein delivery to the proximal tubule 
itself is not likely to be the mechanism of protection, because a 
second lipocalin, retinol-loaded retinol-binding protein (RBP), 
which is also captured by the proximal tubule and degraded in 
lysosomes, was ineffective (Figure 7A). Furthermore, free entero￾chelin and the iron chelator DFO were also ineffective compared 
with Ngal:enterochelin, even at higher molar doses.

Ngal upregulates HO-1 in ATN. A number of studies have identi￾fied HO-1 as a critical regulator of the proximal tubule viability 
in renal ischemia. HO is necessary for recovery from ATN (56–58), 
and its level of expression is directly correlated with the rescue of 
tissue damage. We found that ischemia-reperfusion enhanced the 
expression of HO-1, but when mice were treated with Ngal (10–100 
μg), the enzyme was further upregulated 5- to 10-fold by 24 hours 
after reperfusion (Figure 4E). To determine whether holo-Ngal 
itself, or holo-Ngal in the setting of renal ischemia, induced HO-1, 
we injected normal mice with increasing doses of Ngal and found 
upregulation of the protein. However, the expression of HO-1 after 
Ngal injection was much less than in Ngal-treated ischemic kidneys, 
which indicates that Ngal synergizes with other activators of HO-1.
To determine whether HO-1 activity was required for Ngal activ￾ity, we used the well-known inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (see 
Methods). We found that, while Ngal:enterochelin:Fe (40 μg) pro￾tected the kidney from ischemia-reperfusion damage (creatinine = 
0.91 ± 0.16 mg/dl; n = 3), injection of the HO inhibitor blocked the 
effect (creatinine = 2.74 ± 0.45 mg/dl; n = 5, P < 0.05). Hence, HO 
activity is required for Ngal-mediated protection.
A urine siderophore? The actions of endogenous Ngal in vivo 
might differ from its pharmacological effects, because the criti￾cal siderophore is a bacterial product. Low–molecular weight 
factors that transport iron, however, have been suggested by a 
variety of studies (59–61). These molecules may include citrate 
and related compounds, but also iron-transporting activities that 
have a molecular weight in the range of 1,000 Da. To determine 
whether a cofactor for Ngal is present in the urine, we mixed apo￾Ngal with urine samples from normal mice. While neither apo￾Ngal diluted in Tris buffer (Figure 8A) nor the low–molecular 
weight components of the urine (<3,000 Da) trapped 55Fe above a 
10,000-Da cutoff filter (Figure 8B), incubation of Ngal with urine 
(<3,000 Da) permitted the retention of 55Fe. The capture of iron 
by Ngal was inhibited by 1,000-fold unlabeled iron citrate, and 
more powerfully by a 50-fold concentration of the iron-saturated 
enterochelin (Figure 8B, Sid:Fe). The capture of iron was satu￾Figure 7

before ischemia or within 1 hour after ischemia (+ 1 h). However, Ngal was ineffective when administered later (+ 2 h). The second panel 
shows that apo-Ngal from BL21 bacteria (siderophore free) was minimally active, but that, when loaded with a siderophore (enterochelin), the 
protein was protective: both iron-free (apo-Ngal:Sid) and iron-loaded siderophores (apo-Ngal:Sid:Fe) had a protective effect. In comparison, 
the gallium-loaded complex (apo-Ngal:Sid:gallium) was ineffective, as was a single dose of the iron chelator DFO or the free siderophore 
(Sid). Retinol-binding protein (RBP), a lipocalin that is also filtered and reabsorbed by the proximal tubule, was ineffective. *P < 0.001 vs. ATN. #P < 0.01 vs. apo-Ngal:Sid (10 μg). The numbers in parentheses show the number of animals analyzed. (B) Preparations of Ngal. Ngal:Sid

small aliquots were measured for retention of radioactivity (Washes 
1–3). After 48 hours at 4°C the samples were washed again (Wash 
4 + 48 h). Note the retention of 55Fe by apo-Ngal plus siderophore 
but not by apo-Ngal alone or apo-Ngal ligated by the iron-saturated 
siderophore, which demonstrates that an unsaturated siderophore is 
required for retention of 55Fe by Ngal. 55Fe binding to apo-Ngal plus 
siderophore was stable for 48 hours. (B) Urine (<3,000 Da) was mixed 
with 55Fe and with apo-Ngal, as indicated, and then washed 3 times on 
a 10-kDa filter. While urine (<3,000 Da) or apo-Ngal in buffer did not 
retain 55Fe on a 10-kDa filter, apo-Ngal plus urine retained 55Fe. 55Fe 
retention was blocked by the addition of excess iron citrate (Fe) or of 
iron-saturated enterochelin (Sid:Fe).

rable by increasing doses of urine. These findings suggest that 
mouse urine contains a low–molecular weight cofactor that per￾mits Ngal-iron interactions. Because the endogenous factor is 
competitive with the bacterial siderophore, which binds the Ngal 
calyx with high affinity (0.4 nM) (41), it appears that both bacte￾rial and mammalian factors occupy the same binding pocket of 
the lipocalin. However, the chemical structure of the mammalian 
factor likely differs from that of enterochelin, since, whereas the 
bacterial siderophore was extractable in ethyl acetate, the mam￾malian factor was more polar and remained in the aqueous phase. 
Unlike simple salts, the factor was also soluble in methanol and 
could be eluted from silica resin with methanol.
Discussion
We showed that Ngal is a renal lipocalin that is highly accumu￾lated in the human and mouse proximal tubule during ATN. The 
synthesis of Ngal protein is markedly upregulated within hours 
of ischemia-reperfusion injury (44). However, if Ngal is present￾ed before, or in the early stages of, cell damage, there is rescue of 
N-cadherin (a pathway not previously described in renal disease), 
enhanced expression of HO-1 (a protective enzyme), and the sup￾pression of endogenous Ngal (a marker of epithelial damage) and 
blunting of cell death. The preservation of renal function was due 
not to Ngal itself, but to a siderophore bound in the Ngal calyx. 
While this cofactor is a bacterial product obtained from cloning 
of the protein in bacteria, surely a serendipitous finding, we sug￾gest that mouse urine contains an equivalent factor. Hence Ngal 
is a siderophore delivery protein for the proximal tubule, and this 
study is one of the first to use a bacterial siderophore in vivo (62).
It is currently unknown how the proximal tubule captures Ngal. 
Indeed, an unambiguous identification of receptors for most lipo￾calins is still lacking. Perhaps megalin, which is necessary for rec￾lamation of RBP, is also the Ngal receptor (63). In fact, knockout 
of megalin leads to the appearance of Ngal in the urine (E.I. Chris￾tensen and T. Willnow, personal communication; as shown in Sup￾plemental Figure; supplemental material available online with this 
article; doi:10.1172/JCI200523056DS1), but these animals were 
also, unexpectedly, found to have much higher levels of Ngal mes￾sage in the kidney (64), which suggests that urinary Ngal might 
have derived from local synthesis rather than a failure to capture 
the filtered load. Despite this ambiguity, we believe that Ngal is 
similar to other lipocalins, such as RBP and the α-2u-globulin 
lipocalin (65), that enter the cell by a megalin pathway and traffic 
to lysosomes (dextran+, LAMP1+) for degradation. These data con￾trast with the trafficking of Ngal in cell lines that do not express 
megalin (such as embryonic metanephric mesenchymal cells) and 
where the protein escapes degradation (39). Similarly, transferrin 
is degraded by a megalin-cubilin–based pathway in the proximal 
tubule (66), whereas the protein recycles after endocytosis in cell 
lines. Hence it is reasonable to propose that after filtration, Ngal 
is captured by megalin, is degraded by the proximal tubule, and is 
not recycled. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that 
full-length Ngal does not reappear in the blood at delayed time 
points after injection.
Members of the lipocalin superfamily are transport proteins 
for low–molecular weight hydrophobic chemicals. Well-known 
ligands include pheromones (67) and fatty acids, which bind 
α-2u-globulins and the major urinary proteins, and retinoids, 
which bind RBP (68). Less-known ligands include iron and its 
cofactors, but nitrophorins provide a precedent. Insect nitropho￾rins, for example, contain iron-loaded heme groups that trans￾port NO to the site of a bite (69). α1-Microglobulin (70) binds 
heme and produces the yellow-brown pigment in the urine. A 
wide range of siderophores were recently demonstrated to bind 
tear lipocalin (71). Ngal’s ligand is a bacterial siderophore (entero￾chelin) that can transfer iron to cells or chelate iron from cells. We 
showed this in vitro by monitoring changes in the level of expres￾sion of genes carrying iron-responsive elements (IREs), such as 
ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (39), and more sensitively by 
monitoring changes in the level of expression of reporter con￾structs that contain IREs coupled to fluorescent proteins (43). 
In contrast to these responses, we were unable to show activa￾tion or suppression of a variety of signaling pathways measured 
with 18 phospho-antibodies (including those for Raf, MEK, ERK, 
p38, JNK, and PKC isoforms) in developing kidneys treated with 
Ngal for 20 minutes or for 1 hour. Hence Ngal is a siderophore:Fe 
transport and delivery protein, and we suggest that this is its pro￾tective mechanism. Indeed, most of the Ngal protein (125I-Ngal 
and fluorescent) and its bound 55Fe were delivered to lysosomes 
in the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule, but neither 
free iron (54) nor free siderophore (which binds serum albumin; 
ref. 72) could be delivered. It seems likely that siderophore:Fe is 
transferred to the cytoplasm from the complex, since the protein 
is degraded in the proximal tubule.
We previously showed that induction of epithelia from mesen￾chyme was enhanced by loading of Ngal with enterochelin and 
with iron (43). In the current work we again show that the Ngal:
siderophore complex, rather than apo-Ngal, is the active factor, 
implicating the ligands of Ngal, rather than the carrier protein 
itself. We argue here that siderophore:Fe delivery rather than iron 
chelation is the mechanism of action of Ngal. First, iron-free Ngal:
siderophore probably obtains iron during transit from the peri￾toneum to the proximal tubule, because enterochelin is so avid 
for iron (Kd = 10–49 M) (42). Indeed, iron-free enterochelin can 
strip iron from transferrin (55), and iron-free Ngal:siderophore 
redirects 55Fe from the spleen and the liver (54) and produces a 
threefold increase in kidney and urinary 55Fe contents after injec￾tion of iron-free Ngal:siderophore and 55Fe in vivo. Because Ngal 
is cleared by glomerular filtration, the shift in 55Fe to the kidney 
and to the urine indicates that iron-free Ngal became iron loaded 
during transit. Hence iron-loaded and iron-unloaded Ngal:sidero￾phore delivers iron to the proximal tubule.
We also argue that iron chelation is not like the mechanism of 
protection by Ngal:siderophore:Fe, because in order to act as an 
iron chelator, iron would first have to dissociate from enterochelin, 
which, at least in solution, occurs too slowly to be relevant (Figure 
8) and, in any case, would not produce a net loss of iron. More￾over, if enterochelin were liberated from Ngal after endocytosis, it 
would degrade both spontaneously and by the action of esterases 
(73), and the decay products probably cannot cause a net loss of 
iron (74). Third, while Ngal:siderophore:Fe was protective, the gal￾lium homologue was inactive, despite the fact that enterochelin:
gallium derivatives (75) and Ngal:enterochelin:gallium traffic to 
the kidney and despite the fact that gallium might even exchange 
for iron in the siderophore complex (76). Gallium DFO can even 
be an effective scavenger of catalytic iron (77) and reduce reactive 
oxygen species. Hence Ngal:enterochelin:gallium is ineffective not 
because it can never chelate iron, but because it does not deliver 
the siderophore:Fe complex. Fourth, the pharmacology of the iron 
chelators differs from the actions of Ngal:siderophore. For exam-

ple, in most studies, desferri-DFO (16) is continuously infused and 
single doses, unlike Ngal, are not protective. In fact, while DFO 
is mostly excreted in the urine, Ngal is recovered by the proximal 
tubule, which indicates that the Ngal:siderophore is more likely to 
transfer iron to proximal tubule cells rather than remove iron from 
these cells. Similarly, iron chelation by apo-transferrin reduced 
azotemia in vivo, but unlike Ngal, it did not mitigate apoptosis 
(18). Desferri-exochelin (20), another type of apo-siderophore, pro￾tected the heart from ischemic damage in an in vitro model of cor￾onary artery ligation (20), but this has not been shown by systemic 
infusion, where the siderophore would be exposed to many sourc￾es of iron. Hence while many studies unequivocally demonstrate 
that iron chelation ameliorates ischemia-reperfusion damage, and 
that the lipophilicity of siderophores allows tissue penetration, 
and perhaps access to membrane-associated iron that generates 
hydroxyl radicals (6, 20), siderophore:Fe donation by Ngal, rather 
than iron chelation, explains the data.
The delivery of iron could be protective and enhance cell repair 
for a number of reasons. Low doses of iron or heme, or other iron 
donors (78, 79), induce HO-1 (56, 80). This enzyme is both nec￾essary and sufficient in a dose-dependent fashion to protect epi￾thelia (refs. 56, 81, 82; reviewed in 83) from ischemia (57, 58) and 
nephrotoxicity (84). In fact, the enzyme is specifically induced in 
the proximal tubule (85) by a large number of insults (56), and it 
prevents iron overload in both mouse (86) and human (85) proxi￾mal tubules. HO-1 is thought to protect cells by limiting uptake 
and enhancing the release of iron and thus to reduce the cell con￾tent of non–ferritin-bound iron (31). In addition, it synthesizes 
antioxidant biliverdin and CO and can induce p21 (reviewed in 
refs. 79, 87, 88). Treatment with Ngal:siderophore resulted in 
low levels of expression of HO-1 in normal proximal tubules, but 
markedly enhanced expression of HO-1 in the ischemic tissues. 
We speculate that this induction is the critical pathway by which 
Ngal protects the proximal tubule, an idea supported by loss of 
Ngal activity after introduction of the HO inhibitor. However, in 
addition to HO-1 there are many other iron regulatory pathways 
(ferritin) and non-iron pathways (cell replication) that Ngal may 
stimulate by delivering iron. For example, iron is necessary for the 
R2 subunit of ribonuclease reductase, the enzyme that synthesizes 
DNA (89); it enhances the expression of many cyclin genes (90) 
and stress-related proteins (91); and it inhibits apoptosis medi￾ated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation (92) and NIP3 (93). Last, it is 
even possible that enterochelin:Fe or its degradation products may 
scavenge free radicals.
A model of the postischemic kidney might focus on the idea of 
“cell shift,” rather than on the pathologic consequences of cata￾lytic iron alone. Transport of iron into viable proximal tubule cells 
could supply iron for cell proliferation as well as activate the dis￾posal of excess iron by HO-1 (31), whereas loss of iron from the cell 
is proapoptotic. Chelation of extracellular iron, on the other hand, 
would reduce free radical formation and hence provide protection 
from ischemic damage by a different mechanism at a later point in 
the disease process. To test these hypotheses it will be necessary to 
detect the effect of the Ngal complex on iron levels in the proximal 
tubular cells in vivo (available cell lines have little uptake of Ngal) 
and to distinguish between damaged and viable cells. Perhaps 
expression of our IRE–yellow fluorescent protein construct (43) 
in the proximal tubules of animals could provide real-time moni￾toring of iron in the first hours after Ngal is captured by these cells 
and over the course of ischemic disease.
Bacterial siderophore–mediated rescue of the proximal tubule 
raises the fundamental question of whether mammalian-expressed 
Ngal has the same type of ligand as the recombinant protein. Early 
studies from the laboratories of J.A. Fernandez-Pol (59) and A. 
Cerami (60) suggested that low–molecular weight iron carriers 
were expressed by mammalian cells, but their identification was 
not established, nor were carrier proteins like Ngal implicated in 
their traffic. However, we found a factor in the mouse urine that 
was competitive with the bacterial siderophore. Hence if such a fac￾tor was available in the ischemic kidney, it would suggest that Ngal 
mediates autocrine or paracrine iron trafficking. These hypotheses 
might be validated, first, by protection of the kidney with Ngal 
loaded with the mammalian factor, rather than the bacterial sid￾erophore, and, second, by demonstration that ischemic damage is 
prolonged in mice or humans with defective expression of Ngal or 
its putative cofactor. Creation of Ngal knockout mice, and knock￾outs specific to kidney Ngal, would be a first step.
Lastly, because Ngal has been suggested to regulate leukocytes 
by inducing apoptosis after receptor-mediated signaling (94), it 
remains possible that Ngal is a bifunctional molecule and has 
actions other than siderophore transport. Perhaps endogenously 
expressed Ngal, which peaks hours after ischemia-reperfusion 
injury, might reduce the population of invading leukocytes and, 
conversely, Ngal-deleted animals have a greater burden of these 
cells. However, rather than a proapoptotic action, we could only 
document that Ngal reduced, rather than increased, TUNEL stain￾ing in the ischemic kidney. Most importantly, it is improbable that 
exogenous Ngal regulates populations of leukocytes, because it 
was effective before or in the first hours of ischemia-reperfusion, 
and its actions depend on its siderophore:Fe ligand.
In sum, ischemia-reperfusion has been shown to change the 
activity of a few components of iron metabolism. We demonstrate 
that a siderophore-binding protein is highly overexpressed in 
these diseases and that a single systemic administration of holo￾protein, the iron-transporting form of Ngal, mitigates injury. 
While liver cells may also accumulate iron in the initial phases 
of ischemia reoxygenation by upregulating the transferrin recep￾tor, the proximal tubule may have special mechanisms to acquire 
iron, because these cells do not express transferrin receptors (66). 
In addition to the previously described apical megalin-transferrin 
(66), the current data demonstrate an apical Ngal-iron pathway. 
Our data are applicable to the human, where we found Ngal to be 
highly expressed in renal diseases.
Methods
Patients. We analyzed healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with either 
acute or chronic renal failure. Acute renal failure was diagnosed by a doubling 
of the serum creatinine in less than 5 days. The definition of chronic renal fail￾ure was a serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dl, but unchanged during the 
prior 2 months. The presumed etiology of acute renal failure included sepsis, 
which was defined by the presence of the following criteria: (a) positive blood 
cultures or evidence of local infection in the lung, skin, or urinary tract, and 
(b) fever or an elevated white blood cell count. Some of these patients required 
blood pressure support. Other etiologies of ATN included hypotension due 
to bleeding or heart failure, nephrotoxins, and post-transplantation isch￾emia. The presumed etiologies of chronic renal failure included obstructive 
uropathy, chronic interstitial nephritis, and diabetes. Samples of blood and 
urine were collected from patients evaluated at Columbia University Medical 
Center and at Kyoto University Hospital with approval of both Institutional 
Review Boards and then analyzed in a blinded fashion.

Measurement of Ngal. An anti–mouse Ngal polyclonal antibody was
raised in rabbits, purified on a column of Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads 
(Amersham Biosciences) coupled to recombinant mouse Ngal (see below), 
and then eluted at pH 2.5. Monoclonal anti–human Ngal (AntibodyShop 
A/S; 1:1,000) was also used to detect Ngal. Human Ngal was better recog￾nized by the mAb, while mouse Ngal was recognized only by the affinity￾purified polyclonal antibody.
Human blood samples were initially collected in citrate, EDTA, or heparin, 
but all of these preparations showed similar Ngal immunoreactivity, and 
we chose to study human serum and mouse plasma. The samples were 
centrifuged through a 100-kDa cutoff filter (Amicon YM-100; Millipore 
Corp.), and the flow-through was used for immunoblot. In patients
undergoing hemodialysis,samples were taken immediately before dialysis.
Fresh urine samples were centrifuged at low speed to remove debris and 
then used without further concentration.
Pathologic specimens. Pathologic specimens included ischemic ATN (10 
cases), toxic ATN (11 cases: 5 caused by antibiotics, 2 by zoledronate [ref. 
95], 1 by carboplatinum, 2 by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and 
1 by hemoglobinuria), and glomerulopathies (10 cases, including dia￾betic nephropathy, anti–glomerular basement membrane disease, pauci￾immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, minimal-change 
disease, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), and also normal kidneys 
(3 cases). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (5 μm) 
and subjected to antigen retrieval using microwave in a citrate buffer (pH 
6.0) for 30 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 5% H2O2 for 
30 minutes, followed by blocking in 10% goat serum/1% BSA. Affinity-puri￾fied anti–mouse Ngal (0.4 μg/ml) was applied overnight at 4°C, followed 
by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Vector Laboratories Inc.) and 
avidin-HRP, each for 30 minutes. Slides were developed with DAB/0.3% 
H2O2 for 2.5 minutes and counterstained with hematoxylin. Nonimmune 
rabbit IgG (0.4 μg/ml; Vector Laboratories Inc.) was used as a control.
Recombinant Ngal. Recombinant human and mouse glutathione-S￾transferase–Ngal was expressed in BL21 or XL1-Blue strains of E. coli (Strat￾agene) (39, 41, 96) with additional ferric sulfate (50 μM; Sigma-Aldrich). 
Ngal was isolated using Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham 
Biosciences), eluted by thrombin cleavage (Sigma-Aldrich), and then fur￾ther purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75, SMART system; Amersham 
Biosciences) and examined by Coomassie gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). 
BL21-derived Ngal was loaded with iron-free or iron-saturated enteroche￾lin (0.7 kDa; EMC Microcollections GmbH) using a 5-fold molar excess. 
Unbound siderophore was removed by washing in a Microcon YM-10 
centrifugal filter (Millipore Corp.) with PBS. To produce 55Fe- or gallium￾loaded Ngal, we incubated the iron-free Ngal:enterochelin complex with 
equimolar 55Fe or gallium in 150 mM NaCl/20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 
the complex was washed 3 times on a 10-kDa filter. Iodobeads (Pierce) were 
used to label Ngal with 125I, and unincorporated 125I was removed by gel 
filtration (PD-10 column, Amersham Biosciences) followed by extensive 
dialysis (7-kDa cutoff membrane; Pierce) against PBS. Alexa 568 and FITC 
(Molecular Probes) were coupled to Ngal, according to the manufactur￾er’s instructions, and then extensively dialyzed. Protein was measured by 
Coomassie gels in comparison with BSA standard.
Ngal trafficking. To detect Ngal delivery to the kidney, recombinant Ngal 
(10 or 100 μg), Alexa 568–Ngal (100 μg), 125I-Ngal (10 μg, 2 × 106 cpm), or 
Ngal:enterochelin:55Fe (10 μg, 1 × 106 cpm) was injected into the peritone￾um, and the blood, urine, kidney, liver, and spleen were obtained. Ngal was 
detected by immunoblot. Alexa 568–Ngal was detected by confocal micros￾copy (LSM META detector, Carl Zeiss), and Ngal-mediated iron trafficking 
was detected by scintillation counter and by light microscopic radioautog￾raphy of Epon-embedded kidneys. Slides were exposed to emulsion (Poly￾sciences Inc.) for 1 week and then developed with MICRODOL (Eastman 
Kodak Co.) and counterstained with toluidine blue. To detect lysosomes in 
the proximal tubule, mice were injected with fluorescein-dextran (43 kDa, 
0.5 mg; Sigma-Aldrich) 24 hours before Alexa 568–Ngal (100 μg) was intro￾duced. LAMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was detected in cryostat 
sections of kidneys fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
Mouse ATN. Use of mice was approved by the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee of Columbia University. Male C57BL/6 mice (20–25 g; 
Charles River Laboratories Inc.) were anesthetized with i.p. pentobarbital 
(50 mg/kg) and placed on a heating pad under a warming light to maintain 
37°C core body temperature. Kidneys were exposed through an abdominal 
section, and the right kidney was removed or its vascular pedicle and ureter 
ligated. The vascular pedicle of the left kidney was clamped by a micro￾aneurysm clip (Kent Scientific Corp.) for 30 minutes after right nephrec￾tomy. This period of ischemia generated reproducible renal injury, but it 
minimized mortality (97). In our series, we had 11% mortality in untreated 
animals, but Ngal:siderophore or Ngal:siderophore:Fe treatment reduced 
mortality to 2%. During surgery, PBS (0.5 ml) was used to dampen the 
peritoneum, and the animal was then closed with 5-0 nylon. Ngal, reti￾nol-loaded RBP (a kind gift of W.S. Blaner, Columbia University) (98), 
enterochelin, or DFO mesylate (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the peri￾toneum or s.c. 15 minutes before ischemia or 1–2 hours after reperfusion.
These substances were diluted in 0.05 ml of PBS, whereas control animals 
received 0.05 ml of PBS alone. The HO inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX 
(Sigma-Aldrich) (99) and vehicle (both 10 μmol/kg dissolved in 2 mM 
NaOH, neutralized with equimolar HCl, and then diluted to 0.05 ml with 
PBS) were introduced into the peritoneum 20 minutes before ischemia, 
and also 4 hours after reperfusion.
After 6 or 24 hours of reperfusion, heparinized plasma, urine, and 
kidney were obtained to measure Ngal (polyclonal, 1:500), HO-1 (Stress￾Gen Biotechnologies Corp.; 1:2,000), E-cadherin (BD Transduction 
Laboratories; BD Biosciences — Pharmingen; 1:2,000), N-cadherin (BD 
Transduction Laboratories; BD Biosciences — Pharmingen; 1:3,000), and 
GAPDH (Chemicon International Inc.; 1:3,000) using immunoblots. 
Plasma was also used for creatinine and blood urea nitrogen colorimetric
assays (Sigma-Aldrich) (100). Sagittal sections of the kidneys were fixed in 
4% formalin or were snap-frozen for mRNA and protein analysis. Paraf￾fin-embedded sections (5 μm) were stained with H&E or by an in situ kit
(fluorescein-TUNEL; Roche Applied Science) for apoptotic nuclei or total
nuclei (TO-PRO-l; Molecular Probes). For cell proliferation, BrdU (50 mg/
kg) was injected into the peritoneum 1 hour before sacrifice, and cryostat 
sections were stained with anti-BrdU (Roche Applied Science) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from mouse kidneys using 
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc.) with on-column DNase digestion accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA template was synthesized 
using Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase and oligo-dT primer (QIAGEN 
Inc.). The PCR reaction was carried out using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and 
MyiQ single-color real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories 
Inc.) with incubation times of 2 minutes at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 
30 seconds at 95°C and 30 seconds at 60°C. Specificity of the amplification 
was checked by melting curve analysis and by agarose gel electrophoresis. 
Primer sequences for mouse Ngal mRNA (GenBank NM_008491) were 
CTCAGAACTTGATCCCTGCC (forward primer, positions 93–112) and 
TCCTTGAGGCCCAGAGACTT (reverse, 576–557). Sequences for mouse 
β-actin mRNA (GenBank X03672) were CTAAGGCCAACCGTGAAAAG 
(forward, 415–434) and TCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAAG (reverse, 696–677). 
Each plate included a dilution series of standard samples, which were used 
to quantify Ngal mRNA. Values were normalized for β-actin mRNA.
Iron-binding cofactor. Cofactor-dependent iron binding to Ngal was
measured in 150 mM NaCl/20 mM Tris (pH 7.4) buffer (100 μl) with apo-

Ngal (10 μM), 55Fe (1 μM), and a low–molecular weight fraction (<3,000 
Da) of mouse urine (0–30 μl). The urine fraction was obtained by passing
of fresh urine sequentially through 10-kDa and 3-kDa membranes (Ami￾con YM-10 and YM-3; Millipore Corp.). After 60 minutes at room tem￾perature, the mixture was then washed 3 times on a 10-kDa membrane
(Amicon YM-10; Millipore Corp.). Ngal loaded with iron-free enterochelin 
(rather than apo-Ngal) served as a positive control for iron capture. Ferric
citrate (1 mM) or iron-loaded enterochelin (siderophore:Fe, 50 μM) was 
used as a competitor of 55Fe binding.
Statistics. The data were expressed as means ± SEM and analyzed by
1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test for comparison across 
groups. Ngal levels in humans were log-transformed for statistical analysis. 
The Jablonski score of kidney damage was analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis
test with Dunn’s post hoc test.
