Climate change has increased the incidence of coral bleaching events, resulting in the loss of ecosystem 
function and biodiversity on reefs around the world. As reef degradation accelerates, the need for 
innovative restoration tools has become acute. Despite past successes with ultra-low temperature 
storage of coral sperm to conserve genetic diversity, cryopreservation of larvae has remained elusive 
due to their large volume, membrane complexity, and sensitivity to chilling injury. Here we show for 
the first time that coral larvae can survive cryopreservation and resume swimming after warming. 
Vitrification in a 3.5M cryoprotectant solution (10% v/v propylene glycol, 5% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide, 
and 1M trehalose in phosphate buffered saline) followed by warming at a rate of approximately 
4,500,000°C/min with an infrared laser resulted in up to 43% survival of Fungia scutaria larvae on day 
2 post-fertilization. Surviving larvae swam and continued to develop for at least 12hours after laser￾warming. This technology will enable biobanking of coral larvae to secure biodiversity, and, if managed 
in a high-throughput manner where millions of larvae in a species are frozen at one time, could become 
an invaluable research and conservation tool to help restore and diversify wild reef habitats.
Coral reefs are imperiled globally by ocean warming and acidification resulting from the overuse of fossil fuels1
. 
Since the early 1980s, three global bleaching events and scores of regional bleaching events have caused extensive 
coral stress and mortality2–4
. On the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, above-average sea surface temperatures 
during 2016 and 2017 caused back-to-back mass bleaching events for the first time, resulting in the loss of an 
estimated 29% of shallow water coral cover in 2016 alone5
. Even when coral survive bleaching, reproduction and 
fecundity are often profoundly affected for multiple breeding seasons6
, and the stress caused by warming can 
result in reduced reproductive output even in corals that do not visibly bleach7
. Over three-quarters of the world’s 
coral reefs are predicted to experience annual bleaching by the end of this century8
, so the need for innovative 
restoration tools to conserve and secure reef biodiversity is critical.
One of the most effective methods to secure biodiversity is low-temperature storage of reproductive mate￾rial in biorepositories. Ultra-cold storage of living coral samples from healthy reefs can help mitigate the loss of 
genetic and species diversity caused by natural disasters and major bleaching events while avoiding problems like 
genetic drift that occur in multi-generational ex situ populations9
. Storage of genetic material would also sup￾port and complement existing reef restoration programs, which encompass a range of strategies. These include 
research aimed at improving the ability of coral to adapt to changing environmental conditions (such as assisted 
gene flow, selective breeding, and hybridization)10 and improving restoration methods by diversifying depauper￾ate populations with frozen sperm. To be effective, these restoration efforts will require a broad base of species 
and genetic diversity. Therefore, it is vital to begin globally-linked programs that can secure reef biodiversity over

a broad swathe of populations while diverse reef populations still exist. The present study provides an important 
component for future reef restoration: successfully cryopreserved coral larvae.
Coral sperm have been been successfully cryopreserved for the past 6 years11 and these frozen assets have 
been transported thousands of kilometers to be used in ex situ fertilization experiments that produced new coral 
settlers12. However, the use of frozen sperm for reproduction requires access to fresh oocytes, which are only 
available for a few days each year. Cryopreservation of coral embryos or larvae would circumvent some of these 
challenges.
Cryopreservation of mammalian embryos has been possible for over thirty years, and today vitrification is 
used to cryopreserve embryos from a range of species including humans, mice, and cattle13–15. Despite this long 
history of success in some mammalian species, embryo cryopreservation is still not possible for the majority of 
non-mammalian species such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes. The many challenges of non-mammalian 
embryos include their large size (>0.5mm diameter), a large and fatty yolk, chill sensitivity, and barriers to per￾meability that impede the movement of water and cryoprotectants across cell and compartment membranes16,17. 
Recently, Khosla et al.
18 reported the first successful cryopreservation of a non-mammalian embryo, the zebrafish 
(Danio rerio), using microinjected gold nanoparticles with vitrification and ultra-rapid laser warming19,20. Coral 
larvae share several physiological parameters with zebrafish embryos and present many of the same challenges 
to cryopreservation. Specifically, they are relatively large (around 200–600 µm diameter), lipid-rich, and chill 
sensitive21. With this in mind, we hypothesized that vitrification and laser warming would be a suitable approach 
to cryopreservation of coral larvae.
To examine vitrification and laser warming of coral larvae, we first determined the rates of water and cryo￾protectant movement across coral larval cell membranes in Fungia scutaria. From this information, we designed 
two vitrification solution toxicity tests for F. scutaria larvae at different developmental stages. The selected cry￾oprotectant solution and developmental stages were used for vitrification and laser warming, resulting in the 
production of live, swimming coral larvae. This proof-of-concept experiment forms the framework for future 
experiments that will examine the applicability of vitrification and laser warming to larger coral larvae, such as 
the reef-building acroporids, and determine whether larvae that have been cryopreserved and warmed can find 
their symbionts and settle.
Results
Larval development of Fungia scutaria. Larval age was considered a potential issue for vitrification and 
laser warming because the increasing structural complexity would likely impede the movement of water and cry￾oprotectants and in doing so increase the chances of ice crystal formation. Towards that end, we used AlexaFluor 
488-conjugated phalloidin to label actin to visualize the increase in structural complexity of the developing larvae. 
AlexaFluor 488-conjugated phalloidin labelling showed the growth and development of the mouth, actinophar￾ynx, and gastrovascular cavity in larvae from Day 1 to Day 5 post-fertilization. On Day 1 the gastrovascular cavity 
was narrow and elongated, and over subsequent days the mouth and actinopharynx widened and the complexity 
of the larvae increased as tissue layers developed and mesenteries formed within the gastrovascular cavity (Fig. 1). 
By Day 4, larvae had a very complex gastrovascular cavity and by Day 5 the larvae were capable of infection with 
Symbiodinium (Fig. 1). Developmental changes to larval structure from Day 1 to Day 4 post-fertilization are 
described in greater histological detail in the Supplemental Information.
Movement of water and cryoprotectants across larval membranes. Although previous work has 
addressed some aspects of cell membrane permeability of F. scutaria larvae to cryoprotectants21,22, we wanted 
to review these parameters during larval development with a more rigorous view toward the requirements of 
vitrification and laser warming. To this end, we examined larval volume changes in response to cryoprotectant 
exposure. As with previous studies13,21, we interpreted a reduction in larval volume in response to cryoprotectants 
as an indication of cell dehydration, and a subsequent increase in larval volume to indicate re-swelling of cells due 
to cryoprotectant permeation.
Two- to five-day-old larvae exposed to 0.75M trehalose in 50% filtered seawater (FSW) showed rapid dehy￾dration, reducing in volume by 35–45% after one-minute exposure and remaining at this size for the remainder 
of the three-minute observation period (Fig. 2). Larvae exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and propylene 
glycol (PG) in FSW showed a similar rapid reduction in volume, but this was followed by gradual re-swelling as 
cryoprotectants entered the cells to replace water lost during dehydration (Fig. 2). We observed an increase in 
the amount of dehydration in response to DMSO and PG exposure as the larvae developed from two to five days 
of age, but there was a concomitant reduction in cryoprotectant permeation over this same period. For example, 
in Day 2 larvae there was an initial reduction in volume of ~20% and almost all of this volume was replaced by 
cryoprotectant after three minutes’ exposure, whereas Day 5 larvae showed a 30–35% reduction in volume with 
minimal re-swelling (Fig. 2).
In addition to the volume changes, image sequences of larvae at ×100 magnification on a compound micro￾scope showed changes to the appearance and structure of the larvae in response to cryoprotectant exposure that 
indicated that damage was occurring. Damage usually began with localized destablization of the body wall of the 
larvae after around 1.5minutes’ exposure to cryoprotectants and eventually resulted in disintegration of larval tis￾sues. In late Day 4 and Day 5 larvae this was often accompanied by expulsion of material from the actinopharynx.
Larval rehydration and recovery following exposure to cryoprotectant solutions. We designed 
two vitrification solutions based on the cryoprotectants assessed in the first experiment. Solution 1 consisted 
of 7.5% v/v DMSO, 7.5% v/v PG, and 1M trehalose in PBS, and solution 2 consisted of 5% v/v DMSO, 10% v/v 
PG, and 1 M trehalose in PBS. Both solutions contained approximately 3.5 M of solutes. The toxicity of these

1, the GVC was elongated and flat. There was a clear delineation between the endoderm and ectoderm but it 
appeared to be incomplete in the apical region. The plasmalemmas of cells lining the developing gastrovascular

to develop in the GVC. Additionally, there was more complete development of the endoderm and mesoglea. (C) 
Day 3 showed a well-developed actinopharynx and mouth and more complex GVC. (D) Day 4, the mesoglea 
began to thicken and complexity of the GVC continued to increase. (E) Day 5 presented a continued widening 
of muscular actinopharynx and development of mesenteries.

cryoprotectant trehalose (0.75M in 50% FSW, green), compared to control larval volume in filtered seawater 
(blue), over a three-minute period. A reduction in larval volume was observed within 1minute of exposure 
to permeating and non-permeating cryoprotectants on all four days. Increasing larval complexity affected 
the permeability of DMSO and PG from Day 2 to Day 5. Permeation of DMSO and PG caused larval volume 
to return to the control volume within the 3-minute analysis period on Days 2 and 3, but larval volume only 
returned to 85–90% of control volume on Day 4 and 75–80% on Day 5. Volumes are expressed as a proportion 
of the mean larval volume in FSW for a given day, and each data point is a mean of n≥10 measurements.

cryoprotectant solutions to F. scutaria larvae was determined by assessing the survival of larvae following a 
1-minute exposure to cryoprotectant solution followed by rehydration.
Recovery of larvae exposed to cryoprotectant solutions was observed on all four days, and the proportion 
of larvae that resumed swimming by two hours after rehydration varied with larval age. Day 2 larvae had the 
highest cryoprotectant tolerance, while recovery of larvae on Days 3, 4, and 5 varied. By two hours after rehy￾dration, 100% of the Day 2 larvae exposed to either cryoprotectant solution had resumed swimming (Fig. 3) and 
the appearance of the larvae was not noticeably different from untreated control larvae. Larval tolerance to both 
cryoprotectant solutions decreased on Day 3, with only 70% of larvae exposed to solution 1 and 88% of larvae 
exposed to solution 2 resuming swimming. Recovery was improved somewhat in both solutions on Day 4, with 
84% and 100% recovery of larvae exposed to solutions 1 and 2 respectively (Fig. 3). In contrast to Days 3 and 4 
where larval recovery was higher following exposure to solution 2 compared to solution 1, on Day 5 100% of lar￾vae exposed to solution 1 resumed swimming whereas 85% recovered after exposure to solution 2. Despite these 
apparent differences, there were no significant differences in recovery among any of the days or cryoprotectant 
solutions tested (P>0.05).
Vitrification and laser warming of Fungia scutaria larvae. It was decided to focus on Days 2 and 
Day 3 larvae for vitrification and laser warming experiments since the first experiment showed that larvae from 
these stages had less structural complexity and a greater level of dehydration than larvae from Days 4 and 5. 
Cryoprotectant solution 2 was chosen for vitrification and laser warming trials because of the higher rates of recov￾ery of larvae from Days 2 and 3 following exposure and rehydration compared to solution 1, and because obser￾vations from the first experiment indicated that larval membranes were more sensitive to DMSO than to PG. A 
total of 523 larvae (283 on Day 2 and 240 on Day 3) were vitrified and laser-warmed. Larvae were vitrified in 1µL 
droplets of cryoprotectant solution 2 containing gold nanorod particles on a modified cryotop, and warmed at a 
rate of approximately 4,500,000°C/min with 10.9J of infrared laser energy. Rehydrated larvae were transferred into 
FSW in a 24-well plate (one cryotop per well) and larval survival was assessed the following day (approximately 
12–18hours post-rehydration) by counting the number of larvae that were swimming in each well.
There was a difference in the amount of dehydration that occurred in response to the complex cryoprotect￾ant solution on Day 2 compared to Day 3. On Day 2, larval volume was reduced by ~34% after 60 s exposure 
to cryoprotectant solution 2, while on Day 3 larval volume was only reduced by ~22% at the same time point. 
Larval volume did not change for the remainder of the three-minute exposure time on either day, indicating that 
minimal cryoprotectant permeation was occurring (Fig. 4A). Confocal imaging confirmed that gold nanorod 
particles suspended in cryoprotectant solution were evenly distributed around the larvae (Fig. 4B), which resulted 
in consistent melting of 1-µL vitrified sample droplets.
The number of larvae per sample droplet ranged from 8 to 20 (mean=12.5±0.5 larvae) and there was no 
observed effect of larval number on vitrification and laser warming within this range. There was no significant 
loss of larvae during warming and rehydration on either day (P>0.05), with 80% (226 of 283 larvae) of Day 2 
and 76% (182 of 240 larvae) of Day 3 larvae that were laser-warmed making it through the rehydration process 
(Fig. 4C). Likewise, the proportion of larvae that resumed swimming after vitrification and laser warming was 
higher for Day 2 larvae (43%—122 larvae) than for Day 3 larvae (37%—88 larvae) (Fig. 4C). In addition, the 
proportion of larvae that showed abnormal movement post-warming was higher on Day 3 (12.5%—30 larvae) 
Figure 3. Toxicity experiments measure the proportion of larvae exposed to two different cryoprotectant 
solutions (cryoprotectant solution 1: 7.5% (v/v) DMSO, 7.5% (v/v) PG, and 1M trehalose in PBS, dark 
columns; cryoprotectant solution 2: 5% (v/v) DMSO, 10% (v/v) PG, and 1M trehalose in PBS, light columns) 
that resumed swimming at two hours post-rehydration. Solution 2 demonstrated a better than 80% survival 
on all developmental days, whereas Solution 1 was slightly more damaging to larvae, especially on Day 3. No 
significant differences were found among any of the cryoprotectant solutions or days (P>0.05; Kruskal-Wallis 
test with Dunn’s multiple-comparisons test). Data are mean±SEM of n=3 technical replicates. Each replicate 
contained 20–40 larvae from a pooled sample of larvae from 10 females.

than on Day 2 (2.5%—7 larvae). Although significantly fewer larvae resumed swimming than were rehydrated on 
both days (P<0.05), there was no significant difference in recovery between larvae from Day 2 and larvae from 
Day 3 (P>0.05).
Discussion
We have shown for the first time that coral larvae can survive low-temperature cryopreservation and resume 
swimming after warming. This achievement represents a crucial first step toward biobanking of larvae as a means 
of preserving the genetic diversity of coral, and provides important biological and physical information that will 
enable the development of high-throughput processing to support research and restoration efforts.
The results of the present study indicated that larval age affected the permeability of water and cryoprotectants 
across larval cell membranes, along with the ability of the larvae to withstand cryoprotectant solution toxicity 
and the stresses of vitrification and warming. These differences coincided with increasing larval complexity from 
Day 2 to Day 3 as mesenteries developed within the gastrovascular cavity and internal structures developed and 
became more defined (Fig. 1; Supplemental Information). As with previous studies21,22, the movement of water 
across larval membranes in response to cryoprotectant exposure was extremely rapid at all larval stages assessed, 
Figure 4. Dehydration of larvae in response to complex cryoprotectant solutions reduced internal ice crystal 
formation during vitrification and even distribution of the gold nanorod particles permitted reproducible 
melting of 1-µL vitrified droplets, resulting in live F. scutaria larvae post-warming. (A) Changes in larval volume 
in response to cryopreservation solution 2 (5% v/v DMSO, 10% v/v PG, and 1M trehalose in PBS) in larvae 
from Day 2 and Day 3 post-fertilization. Dehydration was more effective on Day 2 than on Day 3, which may 
account for the higher rate of larval recovery on that day. Volumes are expressed as a proportion of the mean 
larval volume in FSW for a given day, and each data point is a mean of n≥10 measurements. (B) Confocal 
images of a Day 3 larva showing fluorescence from GFP (left) and distribution of DyLight-coated gold nanorod 
particles surrounding the larva in cryoprotectant (right). Gold nanorod particles were evenly distributed in 
the cryoprotectant solution and formed a dense field that completely surrounded the larvae. (C) Total number 
of Day 2 and Day 3 larvae that were vitrified and laser warmed (black), compared to the number remaining 
after rehydration (white), and the number that resumed swimming (grey). The number of larvae that survived 
rehydration and resumed swimming was reduced on Day 3 compared to Day 2 but this was not significant. Data 
are mean±SEM. Columns with the same letter are not significantly different (P>0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test with 
Dunn’s multiple-comparisons test).

but the permeability of the cryoprotectants DMSO and PG was reduced with increasing larval age (Fig. 2). The 
difference in volume response of larvae to the complex cryoprotectant solution, which was greater on Day 2 
(34%) than on Day 3 (22%) (Fig. 4A), may reflect differences in the amount of dehydration that was occurring 
at each larval stage. Reduced dehydration would increase the likelihood of internal ice crystal formation during 
cooling and warming, and could explain why larval post-warming recovery was higher on Day 2 (43%) compared 
to Day 3 (37%). Based on the rates of water and cryoprotectant movement observed in response to individual 
cryoprotectants (Fig. 2) we have assumed that the movement of water out of cells was essentially complete before 
significant cryoprotectant permeation occurred. However, the precise rates of water (LP) and cryoprotectant (PS) 
permeability at each larval stage are yet to be determined, so it is possible that there was some degree of concur￾rent water and solute exchange.
Minimal re-swelling was observed in larvae from Day 2 and Day 3 that were exposed to complex cryopro￾tectant solution (Fig. 4A), which suggests that there was very little cryoprotectant permeation into larval tissues 
prior to vitrification. Permeation of cryoprotectants across cell membranes can occur via passive diffusion or via 
trans-membrane channels such as aquaporins (AQP). While some aquaporins are specific to water (e.g. AQP1 
and AQP2), others (e.g. AQP3 and AQP7) allow the passage of small molecules such as glycerol and urea23,24. In 
mammalian embryos, PG moves across cell membranes primarily via passive diffusion, while DMSO is thought 
to use a combination of passive diffusion and facilitated transport via non-aquaporin channels25, and has also 
been shown to permeate via AQP3 expressed in Xenopus embryos26. Increasing solute concentration, in particular 
DMSO, is known to reduce the movement of water and solutes across the plasma membrane via a mechanism 
referred to as ‘osmotic clamp’27. The higher solute concentration in the complex cryoprotectant solution compared 
to the individual cryoprotectant solutions may have caused a similar membrane response in the coral larvae, which 
could account for the observed lack of cryoprotectant permeation in the complex solution. The high rate of water 
movement observed in all larval stages tested suggests the possibility of facilitated transport across the membranes, 
though the presence of aquaporins or other trans-membrane channels has not been confirmed in coral.
The main requirement of successful low-temperature cryopreservation is to prevent the formation of intracel￾lular ice crystals that can damage and kill cells28. Vitrification avoids ice crystal formation by using high cryopro￾tectant concentrations and rapid cooling rates to transition directly from a solution to a clear, non-crystalline, solid 
state resembling glass29. As in the present study, cryoprotectant concentration can be reduced to minimize toxicity 
to cells and still achieve vitrification, but this increases the formation of ice nuclei during cooling and necessitates 
rapid warming rates to prevent the growth of ice crystals30. Infrared laser warming can warm samples at up to 
10,000,000 °C/min20, depending on the energy applied to the sample and the amount of laser absorbing particles 
present. The concentration of gold nanoparticles and laser settings used in the present study were selected to pro￾duce the minimal amount of warming required to consistently melt the 1-µL sample droplet to avoid overheating 
and causing damage to the larvae. While these settings were sufficient to prevent devitrification during warming 
in Day 2 larvae, they may not have been sufficient to completely prevent the recrystallization of ice nuclei resulting 
from the reduced level of dehydration in Day 3 larvae. It is possible that further optimization of vitrification solution 
composition and laser parameters may improve the survival of larvae, particularly in later developmental stages.
The fact that larvae were able to resume swimming indicates that they survived vitrification and laser warm￾ing, but the best indicators of long-term competence are the ability of the larvae to take on their algal symbionts 
(family Symbiodiniaceae) and to settle. Unfortunately it was not possible to assess these parameters in a mean￾ingful way during the present study due to the relatively small number of laser-warmed larvae generated. Larval 
settlement and metamorphosis to form a polyp are critical stages of development in reef-building corals, but 
only a small proportion of the larvae produced during spawning will go on to become ‘recruits’ on the reef. The 
application of larval cryopreservation to support research and reef restoration will therefore require the ability to 
freeze and warm hundreds of thousands of larvae at a time to account for this expected attrition. Toward this end, 
we have begun work on methods for high-throughput processing that will enable cryopreservation of large num￾bers of larvae from the same developmental stage. Additional challenges that will need to be addressed for future 
biobanking efforts include the presence of Symbiodiniaceae in larvae from species that have vertical transmission 
of algal symbionts (which may affect cryopreservation) and the variation in larval sizes among coral species. The 
F. scutaria larvae used in the present study were relatively small in diameter (~100–200 µm) compared to acro￾porid species (~400–600 µm), which are the predominant reef building coral on many reefs worldwide and are 
therefore an important target for biobanking. Cryopreservation of these larvae may require the development of 
new cryoprotectant solutions and warming parameters, and preliminary work on this has begun.
The ultimate survival of coral species and the ecosystems that they support will depend on long-term inter￾national efforts to minimize the effects of climate change. In the meantime, steps must be taken to preserve the 
biodiversity of coral reef ecosystems while broad genetic diversity still exists, so that future efforts to recover and 
restore damaged reefs will have access to as much diversity as possible. There are challenges that will need to be 
met before cryopreservation of coral larvae can be applied at the scale required for reef restoration, but with con￾tinued development, this exciting technique could become an invaluable research and conservation tool to help 
restore and diversify wild reef habitats.
Materials and Methods
Animal husbandry. To maximize genetic diversity, adult mushroom coral, Fungia scutaria, were collected 
from six different shallow patch reefs in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and then maintained in an open seawater system 
at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology on Coconut Island (21° 26′ N, 157° 47′ W). A two- to three-night 
spawning period commenced two nights after the full moon in the months of June to September at approxi￾mately 17:00h. On nights of anticipated spawning, individual corals were isolated in 2-L glass bowls containing 
0.5-µm-filtered seawater. Although animal care and use protocols are not required for invertebrates, all efforts 
were made to ensure the ongoing health and viability of the animals.

Fertilization. On release, sperm were aspirated from the polyp mouth with a transfer pipette and collected 
into a 50-mL tube, while eggs were allowed to settle at the bottom of the bowl and were collected after spawning 
was complete. Within 30min, sperm motility from individual males was assessed at ×200 magnification with an 
Olympus BX41 compound microscope (Center Valley, PA, USA) by estimating the average of the proportion of 
moving sperm in at least 3 to 5 fields. Samples with sperm motility ≥50% were pooled (4–6 males per spawning 
day). Thousands of eggs from each individual female (5–7 females per spawning day) were gently transferred to 
3-L plastic bowls containing 0.5-µm-filtered seawater and fertilized by adding pooled sperm at a final concentra￾tion of approximately 5×105
 to 1×106
 cells/mL. After 1 h the mixture was rinsed by removing approximately 
75% of the seawater and sperm from the bowl and replacing it with clean 0.5-µm-filtered seawater. Bowls con￾taining thousands of fertilized eggs each remained on a shaded bench-top at ambient temperature (24–26 °C) 
with no water flow or aeration. Water changes were performed daily by collecting larvae into a 10-cm diameter, 
40-µm mesh filter basket, rinsing them with FSW, and transferring them into a clean bowl with fresh FSW. Larvae 
produced from a total of 16 males and 24 females that spawned during July and August 2017 were used for shrink/
swell, cryoprotectant toxicity, and laser warming experiments.
Media preparation. Dimethyl sulfoxide, propylene glycol, and phosphate buffered saline were obtained 
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and trehalose was from Pfanstiehl Inc. (Waukegan, IL, USA). Gold 
nanorod particles were obtained from nanoComposix (San Diego, CA, USA). Seawater used in spawning bowls 
and for larval rearing was filtered with a canister filter system containing 20-µm and 0.5-µm filter cartridges. 
Seawater for larval experiments was filtered with a 0.22-µm nitrocellulose filter (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, 
USA) and used on the day of preparation.
Actin staining. Actin in the developing larvae was labelled using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin 
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) to define the development of the gastrovascular cavity, as described by 
Marlow et al.
31, and imaged using an Olympus BX51 microscope fitted with an Olympus MagnaFire SP camera 
and imaging software.
Larval volume response to individual cryoprotectants. We measured volume changes over time in 
two- to five-day-old F. scutaria larvae exposed to individual permeating (DMSO and PG) and non-permeating 
(trehalose) cryoprotectants. Each cryoprotectant solution was prepared at double the treatment concentrations 
(20% v/v DMSO in FSW, 20% v/v PG in FSW, and 1.5M trehalose in deionized water). For treatment, larvae 
(n=5–10) from a pool of 4–5 females were transferred in 5 µL FSW onto a well slide. An equal volume of cryo￾protectant solution was added to the well and mixed by gentle pipetting to create final treatment concentrations 
of 10% v/v DMSO in FSW, 10% v/v PG in FSW, and 0.75M trehalose in 50% FSW. The moment that the mixing 
began was recorded as t=0. A cover slip was placed over the well once mixing was complete and images were 
captured in dark field at ×100 magnification on a compound microscope using a Lumenera Infinity 3s camera 
(Ottawa, ON, Canada) connected to Infinity Analyze capture software. Images were taken at 5-second intervals 
for a total of 180 seconds. The time taken to place a coverslip and allow the sample to stabilise meant that the 
first useable image was collected at 10 seconds after cryoprotectant addition. Larvae that overlapped or touched 
the edge of the microscope field during treatment were excluded from analysis, so it was usually only possible 
to measure volume changes in 1–5 larvae per well. Exposures were repeated for each larval stage until a total of 
10–15 larvae were imaged for each cryoprotectant solution. For the control, a total of 10–15 larvae were exposed 
to FSW alone and a single image was recorded since volume was not expected to change over time.
Image sequences of larvae in each cryoprotectant solution and in FSW were analyzed in ImageJ software 
(National Institutes of Health, USA). Each image was reduced to 8-bit grayscale and individual larvae within each 
image were identified by x/y coordinates and tracked over time. The semi-minor (a) and semi-major (c) axes, in 
linear pixels, of the closest-fit ellipse to the cross-section of each larva were returned by ImageJ. Linear pixels were 
converted to µm based on a calibration image of a slide micrometer, and larval volumes at each time point were 
calculated based on modeling each larva as a prolate spheroid (V=(4π/3)a2
c). Analysis of most treatments began 
at t=10 s as the time required to mix the sample, apply the coverslip, and bring the cells into focus usually pre￾cluded capture of earlier data. As it was not practical to take images of the same larvae before and after treatment, 
the t=0 volume for treated larvae was assumed to be the mean volume of the FSW control. The response of larvae 
to the cryoprotectants was tracked over time by plotting changes in larval volume. This information, along with 
observations of physical changes to larval membranes, was used to determine exposure times to cryopreservation 
solutions in subsequent toxicity and vitrification experiments.
Cryoprotectant toxicity. Based on the response of larvae to individual cryoprotectant solutions, two com￾plex cryoprotectant solutions capable of vitrification were designed. Solution 1 consisted of 7.5% v/v DMSO, 7.5% 
v/v PG, and 1M trehalose in PBS, and solution 2 consisted of 5% v/v DMSO, 10% v/v PG, and 1M trehalose in 
PBS. Both solutions contained a total of approximately 3.5M solutes. The ability of these solutions to vitrify was 
confirmed by placing a 1-µL droplet of cryoprotectant solution onto the blade of a cryotop (see description below) 
and plunging it directly into liquid nitrogen. The solution was considered to be vitrified if the droplet remained 
clear with no signs of haziness or cracking after immersion in liquid nitrogen with visual inspection.
Cryoprotectant toxicity experiments were conducted when larvae were around 36 hours post-fertilization 
(considered ‘Day 2’ larvae) and repeated at approximately 24-hour intervals for days 3, 4, and 5. Larvae (20–40 
per replicate, 3 technical replicates per larval stage) pooled from 10 females were transferred into a 40-µm cell 
strainer in FSW. The cell strainer was blotted to remove excess FSW then transferred into cryoprotectant solution 
1 or 2 in the first well of a 6-well plate for 60 seconds. Larvae were rehydrated by transferring the filter basket 
through a series of wells containing 75, 50, and 25% cryoprotectant solution diluted in FSW for one minute each,

ensuring that the filter basket was blotted between wells. After the final rehydration solution, the cell strainer with 
larvae was blotted again, rinsed briefly by dipping in FSW to remove any remaining cryoprotectant solution, and 
transferred to a clean 6-well plate with FSW. The 6-well plate was kept in an incubator at 26 °C to allow larvae to 
recover. Larvae were observed with an Olympus SZX12 dissecting microscope at ×50 magnification and survival 
was assessed by counting the numbers of moving and non-moving larvae at 1hour and 2hours post-treatment.
Vitrification and laser warming. Vitrification and laser warming were performed essentially as described 
by Khosla et al.
18, with some modifications. Vitrified samples were warmed using a bench-top iWeld 980 Series, 60 
joule, Nd:YAG infrared laser (LaserStar Technologies Corporation, Orlando, FL, USA). The laser is equipped with 
a stereomicroscope with an eyepiece crosshair reticule to allow visualization and alignment of samples within the 
laser chamber. A custom-made cryo laser apparatus (Design Solutions, Inc., Chanhassen, MN, USA) was used 
to lower the sample into liquid nitrogen for vitrification, raise the sample into the laser beam focal region, and 
trigger the laser for warming. The apparatus was inspired by the Cryojig© described by Kleinhans and Mazur32, 
and consisted of a digital servo (HS-5625MG, Hitec RCD USA Ltd., Poway, CA, USA) fitted with a 3D-printed 
plastic arm designed to hold a cryotop. The servo motor was attached to an x/y stage with a 3D-printed plastic 
base and the whole apparatus was positioned above a 10 (w)×15 (l)×5 (h) cm polystyrene bath containing liq￾uid nitrogen. A control box with custom software (Design Solutions, Inc., Chanhassen, MN, USA) was used to 
control the position of the arm holding the cryotop and to fire the laser. For warming of vitrified larvae the control 
box was used in ‘AUTO’ mode so that a single laser pulse was fired automatically when the sample was raised into 
the laser beam focal region.
Gold nanorods, as characterized by Khosla et al.
18, were used as a laser absorber for warming of vitrified 
samples. The nanorods were diluted with cryoprotectant solution at a ratio of 1:29, for a final concentration of 
approximately 1.75×1011/mL (0.0625mg/mL). This cryoprotectant solution containing gold nanorods was then 
used for vitrification and laser warming of F. scutaria larvae. A laser calibration table was generated using a laser 
power meter (Nova II, Ophir, Jerusalem, Israel) to determine the amount of energy in joules produced by the 
iWeld 980 Series laser at a given voltage and pulse time. The laser energy range required to melt a 1-µL vitrified 
droplet of cryoprotectant solution was calculated based on the absorption properties of the gold nanorods and 
the laser energy output. Final settings (360V, 2.5ms pulse time, and 2mm laser spot diameter) were determined 
empirically by vitrifying 1 µL droplets of cryoprotectant solution on cryotops and observing the outcome when 
the droplet was warmed by the laser. The cryotops used for vitrification were a modified version of the Kitazato 
Vitrification Cryotop® (Kitazato, Tokyo, Japan) that have been used previously for successful vitrification and 
laser warming of oocytes and embryos18,19,32, and consisted of a 1.5×10mm acetate blade mounted in a wooden 
press-fit holder. This system was developed after it was discovered that the laser pulse caused pitting and melting 
of the cryotop blade requiring regular replacement of the cryotop to avoid variation in sample warming. The 
modified version allowed easy replacement of the cryotop blade after each laser pulse to ensure consistent and 
reproducible sample warming. Distribution of the gold nanorod particles around the larvae was assessed using 
gold nanorods coated with DyLight 650 (nanoComposix, San Diego, CA, USA) diluted with cryoprotectant solu￾tion at a ratio of 1:29. A 1-µL droplet of cryoprotectant containing the DyLight-coated gold nanorod particles 
and several F. scutaria larvae was imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Green fluorescent protein 
in the larvae was excited with a 405 nm laser and detected with a 410–626 nm emission filter setting, and the 
DyLight-coated gold nanorods were excited with a 633nm laser and detected in the 641–729nm range.
A random selection of pooled Day 2 or Day 3 larvae was concentrated in a 40-µm cell strainer in a 35-mm 
dish with FSW. Handling of larvae for vitrification and rehydration was performed under a dissecting microscope 
at ×40 magnification. A pipette was used to collect up to 20 larvae in 1µL of FSW and transferred to the lid of a 
35-mm dish. The volume of FSW was carefully reduced to approximately 0.5 µL using a pipette and a 5-µL droplet 
of cryoprotectant solution containing gold nanorods was added to the larvae and gently swirled with the pipette 
tip to ensure mixing. The larvae were collected into 1 µL of cryoprotectant solution and placed on the flat blade 
of a modified cryotop, which was loaded into the cryo laser apparatus. The droplet was checked quickly through 
the iWeld stereomicroscope to confirm the number of larvae (mean±S.E.M.=12.5±0.5 larvae, range 8–20 per 
droplet) and to ensure that the sample was positioned in the laser crosshairs, then lowered into the liquid nitrogen 
and vitrified. After 1 minute in liquid nitrogen, the sample was raised and warmed with a single infrared laser 
pulse of 10.9 J of energy, corresponding to a warming rate of approximately 4,500,000 °C/min. The sample was 
viewed through the iWeld stereomicroscope during warming and samples that melted completely with no signs of 
devitrification or refreezing were removed from the laser chamber for rehydration of the larvae. For rehydration, 
larvae were transferred through a series of 100-µL droplets, consisting of 75, 50, and 25% (v/v) cryoprotectant 
solution diluted with FSW, for one minute each. In each droplet the larvae were swirled gently then collected in 
1 µL and moved to the next solution. After the 25% cryoprotectant solution, larvae were collected in 1 µL and 
transferred to 2mL of FSW in a well of a 24-well plate. Larvae were allowed to recover overnight in an incubator 
at 26 °C, and survival was assessed at 12–18hours after warming as described.
Statistics. Prior to statistical analyses, percentage data from the cryoprotectant solution toxicity experi￾ment were transformed to arcsine values, and count data from the vitrification and laser warming experiment 
were transformed to square-root values. Gaussian distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk normality 
test. Both data sets were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple-comparisons test using 
GraphPad Prism version 7 for Mac OS X. Differences were considered significant at P<0.05, and all data are 
presented as mean±SEM.
