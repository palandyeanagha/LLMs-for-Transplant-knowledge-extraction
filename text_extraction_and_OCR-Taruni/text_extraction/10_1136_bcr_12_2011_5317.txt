 BACKGROUND 
Clinical manifestations of mitochondrial depletion syn￾drome in childhood include severe multi-systemic disease, 
affecting mainly liver, muscle, brain and kidneys. 
Tissue mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion leads to 
inadequate supply of mtDNA gene products 1 2 with sub￾sequent functional defi ciency of mitochondrial respiratory 
chain. 
Nuclear DNA mutations affecting mtDNA maintenance 
may cause a severe decrease in mtDNA copy number 
(depletion). 3 So far, mutations in eight nuclear genes caus￾ing mtDNA depletion (TP, TK2, SUCLA1, 2, POLG1, 2, 
DGUOK, MPV17, RRM2B) have been identifi ed. 4
Mutations in DGUOK gene, although rare (39 mutations 
have been identifi ed so far), have been suggested to be the 
most common cause of mitochondrial hepatoencephalop￾athy. 3 4 Liver involvement with cholestasis, hyperlactaci￾daemia, hypoglycaemia and increased ferritin levels, may 
lead to fatal hepatic failure, usually in neonatal period. 5
Clinical features may also include nystagmus, hypotonia 
and encephalopathy. 4 
5
Diagnosis of deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) defi ciency is 
achieved by identifi cation of tissue specifi c mtDNA deple￾tion and DGUOK gene mutation. 4
Currently, no satisfactory therapy is available for hepa￾toencephalopathy due to dGK defi ciency. Liver transplan￾tation may be indicated in patients with isolated liver 
involvement, since abnormal neurological features have 
been associated to poor survival. 3
We report three cases, from unrelated families, with 
chronic severe liver failure due to depletion and DGUOK 
gene mutations, diagnosed in our hospital between 2008 
and 2010. 
 CASE PRESENTATION 
Patient 1 (P1): male, fi rst child of young Caucasian con￾sanguineous parents (fi rst degree cousins), born at term in 
Spain (May 2008) with low birth weight (2065 g). Family 
history was relevant: a fi rst-degree cousin had been sub￾mitted to liver transplantation at 3 years old due to hepa￾titis A. 
He was hospitalised in neonatal intensive care unit since 
fi rst day of life, with persistent hypoglycaemia. Glucose 
infusion (≤13 mg/kg/min) and hydrocortisone (day 34 
to 66) were required. During hospitalisation, failure to 
thrive (resistant to caloric supplementation), postnatal

 Summary 
 Deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) defi ciency, a rare severe cause of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, has two forms of presentation: 
hepatocerebral syndrome and isolated hepatic disease. The authors report three cases with neonatal liver failure due to dGK defi ciency. 
Consanguinity was present in all patients. One patient had a brother who died with a probable diagnosis of neonatal haemochromatosis. All 
patients had progressive cholestatic liver failure, hypoglycaemia, hyperlactacidaemia, elevated ferritin levels and nystagmus, since fi rst day 
of life. Liver tissue study revealed: cholestasis, iron deposits, microvesicular steatosis and fi brosis/cirrhosis. Only one patient was submitted 
to liver transplantation. The other two died, at 2 and 5 months of age. mtDNA quantifi cation and DGUOK gene study should be considered 
in infants/neonates with acute liver failure and systematically performed in patients with hepatocerebral presentation. Differential diagnosis 
with neonatal haemochromatosis is needed. Liver transplantation might be a therapeutic option. Early diagnosis is important for genetic 
counselling.

cytomegalovirus infection (confi rmed by serology and pro￾tein chain reaction), hepatomegaly, progressive cholesta￾sis, liver failure (4 weeks of age), neurological rotatory 
nystagmus (7 weeks of age), choreiform movements and 
arms and legs hypertonia (3 months of age) were noticed 
( table 1 ). Immunoglobulin, creatine kinase, amylase, 
α1-AT, ceruloplasmin and uric acid levels as well as hor￾monal study and karyotype were normal. Lactate level 
was high (4.5 mmol/l), with elevated lactate/pyruvate 
ratio (30). Plasma tyrosine and methionine levels were 
reported to be ‘increased’ (exact values are not available), 
with absence of succinylacetone in urine. Abdominal ech￾ography, liver scintigraphy, cerebral ultrasound scan, EEG 
(sleep and wakefulness), auditory evoked potentials and 
brain MRI were normal. No abnormalities were found in 
heart and eye examination. He was discharged at three and 
half months of age, by parents’ request. Two weeks later, 
he was admitted at our hospital due to hypoglycaemia, 
cholestasis and coagulopathy refractory to intravenous 
vitamin K. From investigation we highlight normal hor￾monal study during hypoglycaemia, normal plasma tyro￾sine and methionine levels, high alanine plasma level (485 
μM), high blood lactate and high lactate/pyruvate ratio and 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with glutamine 
and lactate peaks ( tables 2 and 3 ). End stage liver disease 
developed, with encephalopathy of level three. He died at 
5 months of age, due to multi-organ failure. Liver biopsy 
disclosed intrahepatic cholestasis, with necrosis and septal 
steatosis ( table 3 ). Enzymatic MRC function study showed 
multiple defi ciencies in liver and complex V decreased activ￾ity in muscle. Genetic analysis revealed mtDNA depletion 
in liver and muscle and a sequence variation (c.677A>G, 
p.H226R, exon 5) in DGUOK gene ( table 3 ). 
Patient 2 (P2): female, second child of consanguineous 
parents (fi rst degree cousins), born in September 2009, 
after a normal pregnancy. Feeding diffi culties, groaning, 
hypoglycaemia, hypotonia and jaundice were noticed since 
fi rst week of life ( table 1 ) and Escherichia coli sepsis was 
diagnosed. At 3 weeks of age, cholestatic liver dysfunction 
with hypoglycaemia and hyperlactacidaemia were dis￾closed. Ferritin level of 765 mg/dl (normal range 9–120 mg/
dl), tyrosine plasma concentration of 538 μmol/l (normal 
range 28–96 μmol/l) and trace amounts of succinylacetone 
in urine were found. She was treated with desferroxamine 
and immunoglobulin, considering neonatal haemochroma￾tosis. Her clinical condition deteriorated at 5 weeks of age, 
when she was referred to our centre for liver transplanta￾tion. She was then submitted to exchange transfusion (fer￾ritin plasma levels ≤1931 mg/dl). Liver MRI showed iron 
overload (60 μmol/g; normal <36 μmol/g). Cholestatic liver

failure progressed and neurologic dysfunction with rotary 
nystagmus emerged. Brain MRS revealed glutamine and 
lactate peaks ( fi gure 1 ). No iron deposits were found in lip 
and salivary gland biopsies. She died at 2 months of age. 
Liver morphology showed microvesicular steatosis and 
cholestasis ( table 3 ) and biochemical study revealed mul￾tiple MRC defi ciencies. Genetic analysis revealed mtDNA 
depletion and a sequence variation (c.677A>G, p.H226R, 
exon 5) in DGUOK gene ( table 3 ). 
Patient 3 (P3): male, third child of consanguineous par￾ents (fi rst degree cousins), born at term, in June 2010, with 
low birth weight (2272 g). A brother died during neonatal 
period with the diagnosis of haemochromatosis. 
Since fi rst day of life, he presented with generalised 
hypotonia, feeding diffi culties with poor suction refl exes 
and hypoglycaemia ( table 1 ). Wide anterior fontanel, 
hypotelorism and macroglossia were noticed. At third day 
of life, acute liver failure emerged. Neonatal haemochro￾matosis was considered and he was transferred to our hos￾pital for liver transplantation. He had hyperlactacidaemia, 
high lactate/pyruvate ratio (28), high ferritin level (1500 
ng/ml), elevated α-fetoprotein level (302300 U/ml) and 
elevated tyrosine plasma concentration (543 μmol/l) with 
absence of succinylacetone in urine ( table 2 ). 
After a period of stabilisation, cholestatic liver dysfunc￾tion with frequent hypoglycaemia episodes and neuro￾logic dysfunction with rotary nystagmus came out at 
3 months of age. mtDNA depletion was found in blood 
and a sequence variation (c.749T>C, exon 6, p.L250S) in 
DGUOK gene was identifi ed ( table 3 ). He was submitted 
to liver transplantation at 5 months of age. Liver morphol￾ogy showed cholestasis and cirrhosis ( fi gure 2 ). One year 
later, graft function is normal (with minimal immunossup￾pression – tacrolimus and prednisolone). Nystagmus per￾sisted and he has visual impairment, severe psychomotor 
retardation and failure to thrive (weight <5th percentile). 
 DISCUSSION 
The association between liver failure and MRC defi ciency 
in infants was fi rst described in 1995. 6 Later on, mtDNA 
depletion was considered the most relevant cause of energy 
impairment in liver. DGUOK gene mutations are the most 
frequent cause of liver mtDNA depletion in childhood, 3
responsible for an important subset of acute liver failure/
hepatoencephalopathy in neonatal period and infancy. 
The three patients under study had disease onset in the 
fi rst week of life, which is in accordance to literature. 5
Patients with dGK defi ciency typically present feed￾ing diffi culties, failure to thrive, and cholestatic neonatal 
liver failure, with or without neurological symptoms. 7
This clinical presentation, with liver disease as the main 
clinical feature, occurred in the cases reported: all had 
early cholestasis, signifi cant cytolysis, progressive acute to 
chronic liver failure and iron overload. 
Differential diagnosis between dGK defi ciency and neo￾natal haemochromatosis must be considered, since ferritin 
levels are frequently very high, with increased iron deposits 
in liver in both disorders. 4 
8 In our series, P2 had markedly 
elevated ferritin levels which leaded to liver MRI, mouth 
mucosal biopsies and iron chelation treatment (based on 
possible haemochromatosis diagnosis). In P3, haemochro￾matosis was also a strong hypothesis due to liver failure 
associated with high ferritin levels and history of probable 
neonatal haemochromatosis in a sibling. 
Levels of AFP were markedly increased in all patients 
under study, as previously described in dGK defi ciency. 1
This is a non-specifi c fi nding, also observed in familiar int￾rahepatic cholestasis and other metabolic diseases, such as 
tyrosinemia type 1. 
Increased tyrosine plasma levels were observed in all 
cases (P1–P3). High tyrosinemia level was detected in 
blood card in one of the two newborns (P2) submitted to 
extended neonatal screening. It has been suggested that 
dGK defi ciency should be considered if elevated tyro￾sine levels are found in extended newborn screening. 4
Tyrosinemia type 1 should also be ruled out by the analysis 
of succinilacetone in urine, as it was done in the reported 
cases. In P2 trace amounts were detected, probably as a 
secondary event. 
Neurologic symptoms (hypotonia and/or nystagmus) 
were present in all patients. In dGK defi cient patients 
these symptoms are usually associated to a poor prog￾nosis. 4 Neurologic symptoms in the context of multi￾system disease may occur due to neuronal energy failure. 
The underlying mechanism is not always clear, since 
hypoglycaemia and encephalopathy are usually observed

secondary to liver failure in patients with acute liver 
insuffi ciency. 9 
The majority of dGK defi cient patients die in the fi rst year 
of life, 4 as occurred in our series. Patients 1 and 2 passed 
away before 6 months of age. Patient 3 is alive, 1 year after 
liver transplantation. This treatment option is known to 
be curative if the disease is restricted to the liver, 9 which 
rarely happens. The presence of signifi cant central nervous 
system involvement, including hypotonia, nystagmus or 
psychomotor retardation should preclude liver transplanta￾tion. 3–4 
10 It does not appear to prevent the progression of 
neurological disease or other extrahepatic manifestations, 
which may cause patients’ death. 3 
9 
10 In fact, despite suc￾cessful liver transplantation (until now), P3 shows severe 
neurological and ophthalmological deterioration. 
In patients with dGK defi ciency, clinical involvement is 
typically limited to liver and brain. 7 However, other organs 
such as kidney may also be affected, as occurred in P2, who 
presented proximal tubulopathy. According to our knowl￾edge, the occurrence of renal disease does not predict long￾term survival and should not preclude liver transplantation 
as a therapeutical option. 3
Morphological analysis of the liver, which may be dif￾fi cult or impossible in the presence of clotting abnormali￾ties secondary to hepatic failure, may be important for 
differential diagnosis. In the reported cases, liver histologi￾cal analysis was done after death or liver transplantation. 
There are no specifi c morphological hepatic features of 
dGK defi ciency, but irregular microvesicular and macrove￾sicular steatosis and cytoplasmic swelling appear to be 
characteristic. 7 Hepatocyte swelling and cholestasis was 
disclosed in all patients described above, iron deposits, cir￾rhosis/fi brosis and microvesicular steatosis were noticed in 
two patients (P1 and P2) ( table 3 ). 
It is predictable that the sibling of P3, who died with 
a tentative diagnosis of neonatal haemochromatosis, had 
the same DGUOK gene mutation identifi ed on his brother. 
The positive family history of severe liver disease in child￾hood (P2 and P3) and the high consanguinity rate in our 
series (P1, P2 and P3) point towards autosomal recessive 
inheritance, according to the more frequent inheritance 
mode of dGK defi ciency described. 2
Learning points 
 ▶ mtDNA depletion and subsequent DGUOK gene 
investigation should be considered in infants/
neonates with acute liver failure (even in the absence 
of neuromuscular involvement) and systematically 
performed in patients with hepatocerebral 
presentation. 
 ▶ Differential diagnosis with neonatal haemochromatosis 
is required, since ferritin levels are frequently 
extremely elevated. 
 ▶ Liver transplantation might be a therapeutic option for 
these patients. 
 ▶ Early diagnosis, which requires the study of the entire 
gene, is of utmost importance for genetic counselling.
