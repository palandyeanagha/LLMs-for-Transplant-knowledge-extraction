The effects of testosterone on bone health
in males with testosterone deficiency: a
systematic review and meta-analysis
Zhichao Zhang1
, Deying Kang2 and Hongjun Li3*
Abstract
Background: Testosterone deficiency (TD) may induce a series of clinical symptoms.
Studies have shown that testosterone supplementation may prevent these unfavourable symptoms and improve
patients’ quality of life. Given the conflicting findings across studies, this systematic review aims to evaluate the
effects and risks associated with testosterone supplementation in middle-aged or aging males with TD.
Methods: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane.
Library were searched to December 2019. The risk of bias of individual included studies and the quality of the
aggregate evidence were assessed using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcome was bone mineral density
(BMD). Meta-analyses were performed. This systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA statement.
Results: A total of 52 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. When compared with placebo,
testosterone supplementation did not increase total BMD (short-term: 1081 participants, MD − 0.01 g/cm2
, 95% CI −
0.02 g/cm2 to 0.01 g/cm2
; long-term: 156 participants, MD 0.04 g/cm2
, 95% CI − 0.07 g/cm2 to 0.14 g/cm2
), lumbar
spine, hip, or femur neck BMD. Furthermore, testosterone supplementation did not decrease the risk of falling or
fracture. Lastly, it was found that testosterone supplementation did not increase the risk of cardiovascular events
(1374 participants, RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.64), all-cause mortality (729 participants, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.04), or
prostatic events. However, testosterone supplementation may improve sexual function and quality of life (1328
participants, MD -1.32, 95% CI − 2.11 to − 0.52).
Conclusions: The effect of testosterone supplementation on BMD and the risk of falls or fracture remains
inconclusive. However, supplementation may benefit patients in the areas of sexual function and quality of life
without increasing the risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, or prostatic events. RCTs with a longer
follow-up period are still required.
Trial registration: We registered our protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42018109738).
Keywords: Testosterone, Aging, Males, Testosterone deficiency, Systematic review
Background
Aging is associated with a 1% decline in testosterone
levels in males, though the causes remain unclear [1].
Testosterone deficiency (TD) refers to a low level of serum
testosterone and may induce a series of clinical symptoms
[2]. Androgen deficiency may lead to dysfunctions of the
skeletal, reproductive, and cardiovascular systems. Patients
with TD also seem to be at higher risk of sustaining frac￾tures3. An epidemiological study [3] of 50,613 patients
with prostate cancer who survived for at least five years re￾ported a higher incidence of fractures in patients who re￾ceived androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) than in
patients who did not (19.4% versus 12.6%, p < 0.001).
Given the association between TD and fracture re￾vealed by the observational studies mentioned above, it
is believed that androgen supplementation therapy can
prevent osteoporosis and increase bone mass. However,

several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) failed to
demonstrate that testosterone supplementation increases
bone density in patients with TD [4–6]. Furthermore,
clinicians have also expressed concern about other asso￾ciated risks of prescribing testosterone to middle–aged
or aging patients with TD, especially the risk of cardio￾vascular and prostatic events [7–11]. Whether testoster￾one supplementation increases the risk of cardiovascular
events remains a focus of debate. Two large cohort stud￾ies [9, 10] reported that testosterone therapy increases
the risk of myocardial infarction. One RCT that enrolled
209 patients [11] also reported that the application of
testosterone gel was associated with an increased risk of
cardiovascular events. However, in another RCT [8], the
authors found that the use of testosterone did not in￾crease the risk of carotid artery intima-media thickness
or coronary artery calcium in 308 men 60 years or older
with low or low-normal testosterone levels.
There is also uncertainty among clinicians about
whether testosterone supplementation in aging males is
protective against other risks, such as all-cause mortality
and prostate cancer. Although several systematic reviews
[7, 12–15] on this topic have been published, they did not
fully address the above questions [7, 12, 13]. While one re￾view [13] investigated the effect of testosterone replace￾ment on patients’ quality of life, it did not investigate the
effect of testosterone replacement on bone mineral density
(BMD), cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality.
Three reviews [14–16] evaluated the efficacy of testoster￾one therapy in males with late-onset hypogonadism
(LOH) and found that testosterone increased BMD. How￾ever, these reviews were either out of date or they omitted
relevant studies; several RCTs reported no effect of testos￾terone on BMD after these reviews [17, 18] were pub￾lished. Given these conflicting results, an update of the
evidence regarding the impact of testosterone supplemen￾tation on BMD is required. Two systematic reviews inves￾tigated the risk of cardiovascular events after testosterone
therapy, but the findings were inconsistent. One review
[8] found that testosterone therapy increases the risk of
cardiovascular events in aging males, while the other re￾view [16] simply made reference to the controversy sur￾rounding this issue. Given that the evidence to date is
both conflicting and insufficient, this systematic review
aims to evaluate the effect of testosterone supplementa￾tion on BMD and its potential risks (fracture, falling, all￾cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and prostate
events) in middle-aged or aging males with TD.
Methods
Materials and methods
We registered our protocol in PROPERO (CRD420181
09738). The systematic review and meta-analysis (study
level) were conducted in alignment with the Cochrane
Handbook of Interventional Reviews and reported in ac￾cordance with the PRISMA standard.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Aging male adults (aged ≥40 years old) with a diagnosis
of TD were included in this review. Because of the lack
of a uniform definition of TD, we accepted any criteria
used in the included studies to define TD. We only in￾cluded studies involving patients with TD who were not
interested in fertility and who were determined to have
well-controlled obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome
(OSAS). Any RCT in which testosterone therapy was
used alone or in combination with other therapies (such
as calcium or vitamin D) were included without restric￾tions regarding treatment dosage, frequency, and dur￾ation. Testosterone therapy might have included oral
capsules, gels, patches, injections, pellets, sublingual tes￾tosterone. The comparator was placebo. The exclusion
criteria were i) studies including patients with prostatic
cancer who had received castration therapy (including
endocrine therapy or testectomy) or androgen therapy;
ii) studies including patients with testicular cancer; iii)
studies including patients with primary hypogonadism
induced by pituitary disease or pituitary surgery; iv)
studies including patients with secondary hypogonadism
(e.g., Paltauf’s dwarfism, pituitary tumour, acromegalia,
or Cushing’s syndrome); and v) studies including pa￾tients who received other medications that influence an￾drogen levels (e.g., finasteride, sildenafil).
Our primary outcome was total BMD. Secondary out￾comes included lumbar spine BMD, total hip BMD, or
other BMDs, the incidence rates of hip fracture, falling,
total fracture, vertebral or non-vertebral fracture, all-cause
mortality, and cardiovascular events (defined as myocar￾dial infarction, angina, coronary artery disease, hyperten￾sion, stroke, or other definitions used in the original
studies), as well as quality of life, total cost, sexual func￾tion, adverse events, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level,
and prostate events, such as prostate cancer or prostatitis.
Searching and study screening
We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, Cochrane
Library, EMBASE and PubMed on 9 December 2019. The
search strategy was developed by an information specialist
and is presented in Additional file 1. There was no limitation
on language, document type, and publication status. We also
hand searched the references of relevant systematic reviews
to identify additional RCTs for inclusion. Two reviewers
screened the search results. Disagreements were resolved by
discussion with assistance from a third party if necessary.
Data extraction and synthesis
Data from each study were extracted independently by two
separate reviewers using a standardized data extraction
Zhang et al. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020) 20:33 Page 2 of 12

form. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with
the assistance from a third party if necessary.
We synthesized data using a fixed-effect method for
all analyses. An I2 estimate greater than or equal to 50%
accompanied by a statistically significant χ2 statistic was
interpreted as evidence of a substantial level of hetero￾geneity. Where substantial heterogeneity was found, we
explored potential sources that may have caused this
heterogeneity. If we could not definitively locate the
sources of heterogeneity, we synthesized the data using a
random-effects model. We summarised all dichotomous
outcome data using risk ratios (RRs) and all continuous
outcome data using mean differences (MDs) and calcu￾lated their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Risk of bias assessment
We made the risk of bias judgments based on the methods
endorsed by The Cochrane Collaboration, which included
the following domains: patient allocation, blinding, selective
reporting, attrition of study participants, and any other de￾tected sources of bias [19].
Additional analysis
We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the
primary and secondary outcomes based on the GRADE
approach [20]. To test the robustness of the results of
the synthesis, we conducted a trial sequential analysis
(TSA) [21] for the primary outcomes. The required in￾formation size (RIS) was calculated based on the empir￾ical mean difference and variance with a two-sided alpha
of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 [21].
Results
Study screening and characteristics of included studies
In total, 2637 references were screened, and 69 articles
derived from 52 studies [4–6, 11, 17, 18, 22–67] were in￾cluded after inspecting the full texts. The study screen￾ing process and the reasons for the exclusion of full
texts are presented in Fig. 1. Fifty-two studies with 5067
participants met our study selection criteria. The study
sample size ranged from 10 to 362. The average age of
the participants ranged from 52 to 77.1 years, with BMIs
ranging from 22.9 to 37.4. As reported in the included
Fig. 1 Study screening flow diagram, Notes: * 52 studies with 69 companion full-text articles
Zhang et al. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020) 20:33 Page 3 of 12

studies, there were 276 (5.45%) participants with CAD at
baseline, 212 (4.18%) participants with dyslipidaemia or
hyperlipidaemia, 261 (4.26%) participants with metabolic
syndrome, 761 (15.02%) participants with diabetes melli￾tus, 419 (8.27%) participants with hypertension, 12
(0.24%) participants with prostatic disease, 186 (3.67%)
participants with osteoporosis, 31 (0.61%) participants
with osteoarthritis, and 57 (1.12%) participants with a
history of fracture. Patient characteristics are summa￾rized in Additional file 2.
Risk of bias
Figure 2 shows the overall results of the risk of bias of
the included studies. The process of randomization was
rated as low risk of bias in half of the included studies.
With regard to blinding, 71% of the included studies
stated that the participants and personnel were blinded
to the treatment protocol. Twenty-nine studies were
rated as low risk of bias in the domain of ‘incomplete
outcome data’ because of the low attrition rate. Sixteen
studies were rated as high risk of attrition bias, as the at￾trition rate was higher than 20% of the total sample size.
Most studies (63%) were rated as low risk of bias in the
‘selective reporting domain’ because all measured out￾comes were reported.
Estimate of effect
Due to insufficient data, only a subgroup analysis of the
treatment duration was conducted. We grouped all the
included studies into short-term treatment duration (< 2
years) and long-term treatment duration (≥2 years).
BMD
Ten RCTs [5, 6, 17, 18, 23, 36, 42, 48, 54, 68] reported
this outcome. The results showed, when compared with
placebo, testosterone supplementation did not increase
total BMD in both the short-term (less than 2 years of
treatment) (8 RCTs, 1081 participants, MD − 0.01 g/cm2
,
95% CI − 0.02 g/cm2 to 0.01 g/cm2
, low quality of
evidence) and the long-term (more than 2 years of treat￾ment) (2 RCTs, 156 participants, MD 0.04 g/cm2
, 95%
CI − 0.07 g/cm2 to 0.14 g/cm2
, very low quality of evi￾dence) (Fig. 3, Table 1). This outcome showed signifi￾cant heterogeneity, but we were unable to identify the
cause of heterogeneity. The optimal sample size for total
BMD for the short- and long-term groups were 9310
and 1776, respectively (Additional file 3).
This nonsignificant effect was also observed for lum￾bar spine BMD (short-term: 7 RCTs [6, 17, 18, 36, 42,
48, 68], 719 participants, MD 0.00 g/cm2
, 95% CI − 0.02
g/cm2 to 0.02 g/cm2
; long-term: 2 RCTs [23, 54], 156
participants, MD 0.04 g/cm2
, 95% CI − 0.07 g/cm2 to
0.14 g/cm2
, Fig. 4), hip BMD (short-term: 5 RCTs [17,
18, 36, 42, 48], 651 participants, MD 0.00 g/cm2
, 95% CI
− 0.02 g/cm2 to 0.03 g/cm2
; long-term: 2 RCTs [23, 54],
156 participants, MD 0.03 g/cm2
, 95% CI − 0.01 g/cm2 to
0.07 g/cm2
, Fig. 5) and femur neck BMD (short-term: 3
RCT s [6, 18, 68], 274 participants, MD 0.00 g/cm2
, 95%
CI − 0.02 g/cm2 to 0.02 g/cm2
, Fig. 6).
Incidence rate of fracture
One RCT [18] reported the incidence rate of fracture.
No significant difference was found between the groups
(short-term, 211 participants, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.31 to
2.76; low quality of evidence, Table 1). No study re￾ported the incidence rate of fracture in specific bone
sites, such as the hip or vertebrae.
Incidence rate of falling
One RCT [56] reported the incidence rate of falling. The
results showed no significant difference between the
groups (short-term, 262 participants, RR 0.70, 95% CI
0.34 to 1.45; low quality of evidence, Table 1).
All-cause mortality
Five RCTs [41–43, 59, 67] reported this outcome. The
results showed that when compared with placebo, tes￾tosterone supplementation decreased the risk of all￾Fig. 2 Risk of bias assessment
Zhang et al. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020) 20:33 Page 4 of 12

cause mortality, however, the difference was not statisti￾cally significant (5 RCTs [41–43, 59, 67], 729 partici￾pants, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.04; Fig. 7), either in the
short-term (low quality of evidence, Table 1) and the
long-term (Fig. 7; very low quality of evidence, Table 1).
Incidence of cardiovascular event
Ten RCTs with 12 references [11, 17, 36, 40, 41, 49, 54,
59, 66, 67, 69, 70] reported this outcome. The results
showed no significant difference in the risk of cardiovas￾cular events between the placebo and testosterone sup￾plementation groups (1374 participants, RR 1.28, 95% CI
0.62 to 2.64). This outcome showed significant hetero￾geneity (I2 = 72%), which was induced by one study [40].
However, after comparing variables, such as patient
characteristics, different types of testosterone, and treat￾ment duration between this and the other studies, we
failed to identify the specific source of heterogeneity.
There was no significant difference between groups both
in the short- and long-term subgroup analysis (Fig. 8;
low quality of evidence, Table 1).
Quality of life
Eight RCTs [5, 39, 41, 43, 50, 56, 59, 63] measured this
outcome using the Aging Males’ Symptoms (AMS) scale.
The results demonstrated that testosterone supplemen￾tation improved patients’ quality of life in the short-term
(1328 participants, MD -1.32, 95% CI − 2.11 to − 0.52,
Additional file 4; moderate quality of evidence, Table 1).
Sexual function
Four RCTs [39, 41, 59, 65] measured this outcome by
using the International Index of Erectile Function-5
(IIEF-5) scale. The results demonstrated that testoster￾one supplementation improved sexual function in the
short-term (503 participants, MD 1.48, 95% CI 0.05 to
2.91, Additional file 5). This outcome had a significant
level of heterogeneity. After exploring the sources, we
found that Tan 2013 [54] was an outlier, but we could
not identify the specific causes for the heterogeneity.
The quality of evidence was low (Table 1).
Adverse events
Eight RCTs with nine references [5, 32, 36, 43, 55, 56,
59, 66, 69] reported the total number of adverse events
between the testosterone supplementation and placebo
groups. No significant difference between the groups
was found in each study, except for Tan 2013 who re￾ported a lower incidence of adverse events in the testos￾terone group. Due to the heterogeneity found in the
total adverse events across studies, we did not pool the
data in the meta-analysis (Additional file 6).
PSA level
Fifteen RCTs [4, 5, 23, 31, 33, 36, 42, 46, 50, 52, 54, 56,
59, 60, 71] showed a slightly higher serum PSA level in
the testosterone supplementation group (1514 partici￾pants, MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.27, Additional file 7).
This difference was observed in the short- but not the
long-term (Additional file 7). Six RCTs also reported the
risk of PSA among the groups, but no significant

difference was found between the groups (1090 partici￾pants, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.81, Additional file 8).
Prostate events
One study [54] reported the incidence rate of prostate
events in the placebo and testosterone supplementation
groups. The prostate events included prostatitis, prostate
nodule, prostate cancer, and PSA increase. No signifi￾cant difference was found between the groups (1 RCT,
108 participants, RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.84).
Discussion
This review included 5067 participants with TD. Evidence
showed that compared with placebo, testosterone supple￾mentation did not i) increase total BMD, vertebral, hip
and femoral BMD; ii) decrease the risk of falling or frac￾ture; or iii) increase the risk of cardiovascular events, all￾cause mortality or prostatic events, such as PSA increase
or prostatitis; however, testosterone supplementation was
associated with improved quality of life and sexual func￾tion. Nonetheless, the above findings may be influenced
by the presence of attrition bias and selective reporting in
individual RCTs. Furthermore, the small total sample size
and the unexplained heterogeneity between studies also
impacted the quality of the body of evidence, especially for
long-term outcomes and the risk of cardiovascular events.
In terms of sexual function and quality of life, the indirect
approach used to interpret the results of the screening
tools somewhat reduces our level of confidence in these
findings. All the included studies used surrogate outcome

measurements, namely the mean difference in the scores
of each scale, to reflect improvement in these two out￾comes. However, clinicians must also consider whether
the differences in the scores between the two compared
groups are clinically significant.
Testosterone receptors are widely distributed in bone
tissues. When combined with these receptors, testoster￾one facilitates skeletal growth and development, for in￾stance by stimulating the proliferation of preosteoblasts
and the differentiation of osteoblasts (non-dependent
oestrogen conversion) and by promoting the maturation
and ossification of cartilage cells and deposits of calcium
on bone [72]. Theoretically, testosterone supplementa￾tion can improve bone health in patients with TD. How￾ever, the current meta-analysis failed to demonstrate this
effect, a finding that is consistent with previous system￾atic reviews [15, 73–75]. Contrary to our findings, a
guideline published in 2010 [76] stated that although
testosterone had no effect on vertebral, hip and femoral
BMD, it was associated with an increase in lumbar
BMD. A possible reason for this inconsistent finding is
that this guideline focused on patients with osteoporosis,
while we included only a very small proportion of partic￾ipants with osteoporosis. Nonetheless, even with our
negative finding, there are several reasons why caution
must be exercised in concluding that testosterone does
not affect BMD. First, the finding that testosterone sup￾plementation did not improve BMD in the short-term
(< 2 years) may due to inadequate duration of treatment.
It is well known that the effect of testosterone on BMD
is only evident after more than 2 years of use. However,
only 156 participants from two studies used testosterone
for > 2 years, and the sample size is too small to detect a
significant difference between the groups. Second, al￾though all participants were androgen deficient, most
did not have any abnormality in bone mass density or
any evidence of osteoporosis at baseline; therefore, the
change in BMD before and after testosterone supple￾mentation may be nonsignificant. We also did not find
any difference in the risk of fall or fracture between the
testosterone supplementation and the placebo groups,
though this may also be due to inadequate treatment
duration and the small sample size.
Several studies [7, 9, 11] indicated that testosterone in￾creases the risk of cardiovascular events. However, we
did not find this effect in our meta-analysis, possibly be￾cause only a small proportion (5.45%) of participants in
our review had a history of CAD at baseline, while
Fig. 6 Testosterone versus placebo: Meta-analysis of femur neck BMD
Fig. 7 Testosterone versus placebo: Meta-analysis of all-cause mortality
Zhang et al. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020) 20:33 Page 8 of 12

several studies [9–11] included a larger number of pa￾tients with a history of CAD. Furthermore, the age range
of participants also differs between our review and the
above studies, with the latter including participants older
than 60 years compared with our inclusion of partici￾pants over 40 years of age. One cohort study [10] indi￾cated that a history of CAD and an age greater than 65
years were risk factors for cardiovascular events in pa￾tients treated with testosterone.
With regard to all-cause mortality, our review found
that testosterone did not decrease the risk of all-cause
mortality in patients with TD. We concluded that this
negative result was due to inadequate sample size, as
there was an obvious trend towards a reduction in the
rate of all-cause mortality in the testosterone supple￾mentation group; however, the 95% confidence interval
was too wide to detect a significant difference. While
this result is consistent with another review [72] in
which testosterone supplementation was found not to
increase the incidence of severe adverse events, includ￾ing mortality, it is contrary to the finding reported in a
cohort study of a positive association between testoster￾one supplementation and all-cause mortality [10]. These
inconsistent findings may in part be explained by the
variations in the baseline characteristics of the partici￾pants, especially the differences in ages and associated
comorbidities. More RCTs are clearly needed to better
identify the effect of testosterone supplementation on
mortality.
Three studies [12, 13, 77] found that testosterone ther￾apy increases sexual function in patients with a low tes￾tosterone level, which is consistent with our finding. We
also found improved quality of life in the testosterone
therapy group. However, one study did not find this
favourable effect [76]. In that study [76], the included
participants had complex comorbidities, which may ex￾plain this difference. In our meta-analysis fewer partici￾pants had comorbidities, and thus, a significant
improvement in quality of life may have been more
evident.
Persistent concerns revolve around whether testos￾terone supplementation increases the risk of prostate
cancer or BPH. Consistent with other observational
studies [78–80], this review did not find an associ￾ation between testosterone supplementation and pros￾tate cancer. Interestingly, subnormal testosterone
levels have been reported to be associated with high￾grade prostate cancer [81].
This systematic review has some strengths. First, the
search strategy was developed by a professional informa￾tion specialist. In addition, we searched both electronic
databases and hand searched the references of relevant
systematic reviews. This approach allowed us to collect
as many relevant RCTs as possible. Second, the study
screening and data extraction process were conducted
by two researchers independently to minimize bias.
The systematic review also has some limitations. For
instance, the long-term data for primary or secondary

outcomes were insufficient to detect a clear difference
between the groups. Furthermore, significant heterogen￾eity between populations was identified, such as the def￾inition of TD or LOH and differences in the presence of
comorbidities at baseline. Despite the presence of signifi￾cant heterogeneity, we were unable to determine
whether the variations in the effect of testosterone sup￾plementation across subgroup populations were due to
insufficient data.
Conclusion
Implications for practice
The effect of testosterone supplementation on BMD and
on the risk of falling or fracture in patients with TD re￾mains inconclusive. However, testosterone supplementa￾tion may improve sexual function and quality of life
without increasing the risk of CAD, all-cause mortality,
and prostate diseases.
Implications for research
Further research is needed with RCTs that adequately
report methods used for generating random allocation
sequences. Larger RCTs with long-term data on the ef￾fect of testosterone supplementation on BMD, risk of
fracture or falling, CAD, and all-cause mortality are re￾quired. Lastly, RCTs are also needed that focus on our
predefined subgroup population of TD patients, such as
those between 40 and 65 years of age as well as patients
with osteoporosis or a history of CAD.
