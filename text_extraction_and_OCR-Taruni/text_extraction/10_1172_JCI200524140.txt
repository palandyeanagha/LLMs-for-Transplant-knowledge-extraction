In diabetic LDLR–/– mice, an ectopic BMP2-Msx2 gene regulatory program is upregulated in association with 
vascular calcification. We verified the procalcific actions of aortic Msx2 expression in vivo. CMV-Msx2 trans￾genic (CMV-Msx2Tg+) mice expressed 3-fold higher levels of aortic Msx2 than nontransgenic littermates. On 
high-fat diets, CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice exhibited marked cardiovascular calcification involving aortic and coro￾nary tunica media. This corresponded to regions of Msx2 immunoreactivity in adjacent adventitial myofi￾broblasts, suggesting a potential paracrine osteogenic signal. To better understand Msx2-regulated calcifi￾cation, we studied actions in 10T1/2 cells. We found that conditioned media from Msx2-transduced 10T1/2 
cells (Msx2-CM) is both pro-osteogenic and adipostatic; these features are characteristic of Wnt signaling. 
Msx2-CM stimulated Wnt-dependent TCF/LEF transcription, and Msx2-transduced cells exhibited increased 
nuclear β-catenin localization with concomitant alkaline phosphatase induction. Msx2 upregulated Wnt3a
and Wnt7a but downregulated expression of the canonical inhibitor Dkk1. Dkk1 treatment reversed osteogenic 
and adipostatic actions of Msx2. Teriparatide, a PTH1R agonist that inhibits murine vascular calcification, 
suppressed vascular BMP2-Msx2-Wnt signaling. Analyses of CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice confirmed that Msx2 sup￾presses aortic Dkk1 and upregulates vascular Wnts; moreover, TOPGAL+ (Wnt reporter); CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice 
exhibited augmented aortic LacZ expression. Thus, Msx2-expressing cells elaborated an osteogenic milieu that 
promotes vascular calcification in part via paracrine Wnt signals.
Introduction
Vascular calcification is a common feature of aging, diabetes, dys￾lipidemia, abnormal valve biomechanics, and end-stage renal dis￾ease (ESRD) (1–3). Four histoanatomic variants — medial artery 
calcification, atherosclerotic intimal calcification, valvular calci￾fication, and soft tissue calciphylaxis — can be readily identified 
(1–3). While calciphylaxis results from passive tissue mineraliza￾tion arising from thermodynamic excess of the calcium phos￾phate product, the first 3 variants proceed in part via the matrix 
vesicle–mediated calcification characteristic of intramembranous 
and endochondral bone formation (1–3). Once macrovascular cal￾cification was considered benign, but its deleterious consequences 
have now become clear (1–3). Medial artery calcification presages 
a 4-fold increased risk for lower extremity amputation and 2-fold 
enhanced cardiovascular mortality in patients with type II dia￾betes (4). Medial artery calcification and atherosclerotic intimal 
calcification independently portend mortality in patients with 
ESRD (5). Aortic arch calcification correlates with stroke risk, and 
aortic valve calcification is a strong predictor of disease progres￾sion in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (reviewed in 
refs. 1, 2). In medial, intimal, and valvular calcification, immune 
responses initiated by oxidized LDL (6) contribute to low-grade 
vascular inflammation with upregulation of TNF-α (7) and bone 
morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) (8). BMP2 expression is activat￾ed by TNF-α (9), oxidized lipids (9), and hyperglycemia (7, 10) in 
vascular myofibroblasts and endothelium. BMP2 is necessary for 
osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells (11); via Smad￾dependent signals, BMP2 upregulates osteogenic (e.g., Msx2, Dlx5, 
Osterix [Osx]) and chondro-osteogenic (Runx2/Cbfa1, Sox9) tran￾scription factors in mineralizing mesenchymal progenitors (12). 
Demer first demonstrated BMP2 expression as a feature of athero￾sclerotic calcification (8). Following these seminal observations, 
others detailed the temporospatial expression of BMP2-regulated 
intramembranous and endochondral gene expression programs 
in calcific vasculopathy (13, 14). Thus, in addition to being key 
inhibitors of tissue mineralization (15–18), osteogenic programs 
actively contribute to vascular calcification.
We previously described high-fat diets as promoting vascular 
calcification and upregulating aortic BMP2 and Msx2 expression 
in LDL receptor–null (LDLR–/–) mice (10, 14, 19). In response to 
high-fat diets, male LDLR–/– mice develop diabetes and dyslipid￾emia (14). In this model of disease initiation, in situ hybridization 
studies demonstrated that the pattern of Msx2 expression in car￾diac valves and adventitial myofibroblasts overlaps the expression 
pattern of Acta2 (i.e., VSMC α-actin) (14). Msx2 is a BMP2-induc￾ible transcription factor that controls craniofacial mineralization 
(20). While promoting early osteoblast development, Msx2 inhib￾its osteoblast terminal differentiation; Msx2 is downregulated by 
inhibitory protein-protein interactions with Dlx family members 
that trigger full elaboration of the osteoblast phenotype (21). We 
recently demonstrated that Msx2 programs osteogenic differenti￾ation of vascular myofibroblasts (10). This occurs in part via cell￾autonomous actions that diminish PPARγ expression (10). We

now extend these observations by showing that cells that express 
Msx2 also elaborate paracrine signals that promote osteogenic 
differentiation and suppress adipogenesis. Msx2 upregulates 
expression of multiple Wnt ligands (22), downregulates the LDL 
receptor–related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) antagonist dickkopf 
homologue 1 (Dkk1) (23), and enhances aortic canonical Wnt 
signaling (23). Therefore, Msx2 activates nuclear localization of 
β-catenin, a transcriptional coadapter of T cell factor/lymphoid 
enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) indispensable for osteoblast differen￾tiation and osteogenic calcification (24).
Results
CMV-Msx2 transgenic mice exhibit cardiovascular calcification in areas 
overlapping and adjacent to Msx2 expression. High-fat diets upregu￾late the vascular expression of BMP2 and Msx2 (10, 14, 19), sig￾naling molecules that participate in osteoblast differentiation 
and intramembranous ossification (12, 20). Since high-fat diets 
promote vascular calcification in male LDLR–/– mice (14, 25) and 
BMP2-Msx2 signaling promotes osteogenic mineralization of 
cultured myofibroblasts (10), we proposed that Msx2 exerts pro￾calcific actions during macrovascular calcification in vivo. To test 
this notion, we generated CMV-Msx2Tg+ (cytomegalovirus imme￾diate early promoter–Msx2 transgenic) mice, a model previously 
demonstrated to recapitulate features of Msx2 action during cra￾niosynostosis (26). We examined effects in LDLR+ C57Bl/6 mice, a 
background of intermediate susceptibility to diet-induced vascular 
disease as compared with LDLR–/– mice (27). Sixteen weeks of high￾fat diet had little effect on vascular calcification in nontransgenic 
mice (Figure 1B). In contrast, in 5 of 6 male CMV-Msx2Tg+ sib￾lings, pronounced cardiovascular calcification, revealed by aliza￾rin red calcium staining, was observed (Figure 1A). Dense calcium 
deposition was observed in the aortic media, coronary arteries, pul￾monary outflow tract, and adjacent right-ventricular myocardium 
(Figure 1A). In transgenic mice, the CMV promoter drives cell-type 
selective expression, directing expression in tissues subject to high 
levels of CMV pathology (28). In the vasculature, endothelial cells 
and vascular smooth muscle cells support transgenic CMV pro￾moter activity (28); RT-PCR demonstrates that aortic expression of 
Msx2 is enhanced 3-fold in CMV-Msx2Tg+ animals, thus confirm￾ing cardiovascular expression of the Msx2 transgene (see below).
To further characterize cardiovascular expression of Msx2, we 
performed immunohistochemistry for Msx2 protein. Msx2 expres￾sion is most intense in a subpopulation of adventitial cells (Figure 
2A) and at sites of cardiovascular valve leaflet insertion (Figure 
2B). Moreover, patchy foci of right ventricular interstitial cardiac 
myofibroblasts also expressed Msx2 (not shown). Intriguingly, the 
majority of aortic medial cells — VSMCs — lacked significant Msx2 
expression even though medial calcium deposition was widely dis￾tributed (Figures 1 and 2). We next examined expression of alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), a key osteogenic enzyme upregulated by Msx2 in 
cell culture (10) and required for osteogenic mineralization (18). As 
shown in Figure 2C, ALP expression also localized to cells occupying 
the medial compartment in aorta and coronary arteries — the sites 
of vascular calcification. To confirm induction of an osteogenic-like 
gene regulatory process, we studied expression of sclerostin (SOST), 
an osteocyte protein (29), by Western blot. SOST is increased in the 
aortas of CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice compared with nontransgenic sib￾lings (Figure 2D); no differences were observed in the abundance of 
β-actin. Of note, no differences in serum calcium (8.27 ± 0.43 mg/
dl vs. 8.25 ± 0.53 mg/dl, P = 0.94), delipidated serum phosphorus 
(2.17 ± 0.37 mg/dl vs. 2.44 ± 0.17 mg/dl) (P = 0.52), or aqueous cal￾cium phosphate product (18.1 ± 3.4 mg2/dl2 vs. 20.1 ± 1.5 mg2/dl2, 
P = 0.60) were observed between wild-type and transgenic siblings, 
respectively. Thus, augmented aortic Msx2 expression provides sig￾nals that enhance cardiovascular calcification.
Conditioned media from Msx2-transduced cells enhanced ALP induction 
and inhibited lipid accumulation in 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells. Because 
areas of medial calcification are adjacent to regions of greatest 
adventitial Msx2 expression, we hypothesized that Msx2-express￾ing myofibroblasts might elaborate pro-osteogenic signals that 
function in a paracrine fashion. We previously demonstrated that 
the C3H10T1/2 cell system represents a highly useful cell culture 
model for studying effects of Msx2 on osteogenic, adipogenic, and 
smooth muscle differentiation (10). This mesenchymal progenitor 
shares features of vascular myofibroblasts and can readily adopt 
the mural VSMC fate when transplanted in vivo (30). Therefore, 
we assessed whether the conditioned media (CM) from Msx2-
transduced 10T1/2 cells could alter osteogenic and/or adipogenic 
differentiation. As compared with CM from SFG-bacterial β-galac￾tosidase (SFG-LacZ) controls, CM collected from 10T1/2 cells 
transduced with SFG-Msx2 (Msx2) significantly augmented ALP 
activity in heterologous 10T1/2 cells (Figure 3A). An even greater 
effect was observed in adipogenesis assays; CM from SFG-Msx2 
cells markedly inhibited oil red O lipid accumulation in 10T1/2

cells cultured under adipogenic conditions (Figure 3B). To con￾firm that Msx2-expressing cells elaborate paracrine signals, we 
transiently expressed either enhanced green fluorescent protein 
(EGFP) or EGFP-Msx2 fusion protein in 10T1/2 cells, then imaged 
GFP and ALP activity (Vector Red) by dual immunofluorescence in 
cultured regions of low transfection efficiency. As compared with 
EGFP controls, 10T1/2 cells adjacent to cells expressing EGFP￾Msx2 stain more intensely for ALP (Figure 3C). Thus, cells express￾ing Msx2 upregulate paracrine signals that control mesenchymal 
cell differentiation.
CM from Msx2-transduced cells enhances TOPFLASH activity, and Msx2 
enhances nuclear β-catenin accumulation. Several polypeptides, includ￾ing Wnt family members (11, 31), have been shown to promote 
osteogenesis and inhibit adipogenesis. Since Wnts are key modula￾tors of osteogenic mesenchymal cell fate (22, 32), we examined the 
effects of Msx2 CM on canonical Wnt signaling using activation 
of the Wnt-responsive TCF/LEF transcriptional reporter–LUC 
reporter, TOPFLASH (33). As compared with CM from SFG-LacZ 
controls (10), CM collected from 10T1/2 cells transduced with 
SFG-Msx2 (10) significantly augmented TOPFLASH activity (Fig￾ure 4A). Rous sarcoma virus minimal promoter LUC (RSVLUC), a 
minimal promoter–LUC reporter lacking TCF/LEF cognates, was 
not regulated by Msx2-CM or Wnt3a-CM (not shown). We cocul￾tured TOPFLASH-transfected 10T1/2 reporter cells onto trans￾duced SFG-LacZ and onto SFG-Msx2 cell monolayers and then 
compared the results. Reporter cell TOPFLASH activity was great￾er on SFG-Msx2 layers as compared with SFG-LacZ control cell 
feeder layers, indicating enhanced paracrine Wnt signaling (Figure 
4B). A key component of Wnt-regulated TCF/LEF-dependent tran￾scription is nuclear localization of the transcriptional coadapter, 
β-catenin (33). Thus, we studied the effect of Msx2 expression on 
β-catenin localization. As shown in Figure 4C, in cells expressing 
control SFG-LacZ virus, β-catenin is localized primarily in the cyto￾plasm. By contrast, SFG-Msx2 markedly enhances (by 15-fold) the 
nuclear localization of β-catenin (Figure 4, C and D). Thus, Msx2 
enhances canonical Wnt signaling in cultures of 10T1/2 cells.
Msx2 regulation of 10T1/2 osteogenic versus adipogenic differentiation 
is inhibited by Dkk1. Canonical Wnt signaling is negatively regu￾lated by Dkk1, an inhibitory ligand for the cell surface receptors 
LRP5 and LRP6 (11, 23). To further test the role for paracrine 
Wnt signaling in Msx2 actions, we studied the effects of recom￾binant purified Dkk1 protein (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 
5B, Dkk1 inhibits Wnt3a induction of TOPFLASH activity in 
10T1/2 cells, consistent with its inhibitory actions on canoni￾Figure 2

immunohistochemistry in cardiovascular tissues from male CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice. Background signal arising from nonspecific binding of second￾ary antibody was assessed in the absence of primary antibody. Note expression of Msx2 transgene in adventitial cells (A) and cells at the aortic

media. (D) Western blot analysis of aortic proteins extracted from Msx2Tg+ compared with those from nontransgenic siblings. The expression 
of the osteocyte marker SOST was greater in aortas of CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) as compared to SOST expression observed in 
aortas of nontransgenic siblings (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) . All animals were fed high-fat diets as outlined in Methods. Arrows in A–C indicate nuclear 
staining. No 1° Ab, no primary antibody added.

cal Wnt signaling. In contrast, an irrelevant recombinant protein 
— Tubedown-100 (34) — has no effect. Dkk1 has no effect on 
basal TOPFLASH (Figure 5B) reporter activity. RSVLUC, a mini￾mal promoter — LUC reporter lacking TCF/LEF cognates, was 
not regulated by Wnt3a or Dkk1 (not shown). We next examined 
the effects of Dkk1 on ALP induction and adipogenesis. Dkk1 (1 
μg/ml) inhibited Msx2-induced ALP activity in 10T1/2 cells by 
50% (Figure 5C). An even greater effect was observed on Msx2-
regulated adipogenesis. Msx2 expression suppressed oil red O 
accumulation by more than 80% (Figure 5D); however, Dkk1 
partially reversed Msx2 inhibition, increasing oil red O accu￾mulation 3- to 4-fold compared with vehicle-treated cells. Thus, 
both Msx2 enhancement of osteogenesis and Msx2 inhibition of 
adipogenesis are antagonized by Dkk1, indicating that Wnt-like 
paracrine signals contribute to Msx2 actions in 10T1/2 cells.
Msx2 suppresses Dkk1 expression and enhances Wnt3a and Wnt7a 
expression in primary aortic myofibroblasts and 10T1/2 cells. Dur￾ing development, vascular myofibroblasts and mesodermal cells 
express high levels of Wnt ligands, including Wnt2, Wnt3, Wnt5, 
and Wnt7 (22). Moreover, Dkk1, LRP5, and LRP6 have been shown 
to be expressed in VSMCs (22). Therefore, we examined whether 
transduction of 10T1/2 cells with SFG-Msx2 altered expression 
profiles of Wnt ligands, the prototypic antagonist Dkk1, or its 
receptor targets LRP5 and LRP6. In triplicate, primary aortic myo￾fibroblasts or 10T1/2 cells were trans￾duced either with SFG-LacZ control 
or SFG-Msx2 virus; RNA was then 
isolated and gene expression quan￾tified by fluorescence RT-PCR (see 
Methods). Transduction of 10T1/2 
or aortic cell cultures with SFG￾Msx2 enhances Msx2 mRNA accu￾mulation approximately 5,000-fold 
as compared with that in SFG-LacZ 
control cells (not shown). In both 
cell backgrounds, Msx2 suppressed
Dkk1 expression by more than 80%, 
while Wnt3a, Wnt5b, and Wnt7a were 
upregulated 3- to 9-fold (Figure 6). 
The Wnt7a response in primary aor￾tic myofibroblasts was much greater, 
induced 192 ± 6.3 fold (P < 0.001) 
by Msx2 expression (not shown). In 
primary cells, no significant changes 
were observed in the expression of 
the multifunctional ligand Dkk2, 
Wnt2, or the Wnt coreceptor LRP6. As 
shown in Figure 6, LRP5 and Wnt5a
were either unaffected or variably 
upregulated 2- to 3-fold, depending 
upon cell background. Thus, expres￾sion of the transcription factor Msx2 
in myofibroblasts alters the gene 
expression profiles of Wnt-signal￾ing regulators, upregulating key Wnt 
family members and suppressing the 
canonical antagonist Dkk1.
CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice exhibit reduced 
aortic Dkk1 and enhanced aortic Wnt 
expression compared with nontransgenic 
littermates. Our studies of 10T1/2 and primary aortic myofibro￾blast cell cultures indicate that Msx2 can upregulate expression 
of Wnt ligands, suppress Dkk1, and thus promote canonical Wnt 
signaling. To evaluate whether Msx2 regulated Wnt signaling in 
vivo, total aortic RNA was isolated from the aortas of either CMV￾Msx2Tg+ (n = 5) or wild-type (n = 5) male siblings. Gene expression 
was quantified in independent duplicates for each aortic specimen 
as detailed (19). Msx2 mRNA accumulation was increased 3-fold in 
CMV-Msx2Tg+ as compared with nontransgenic littermates (Figure 
7). Consistent with our in vitro observation, levels of aortic Dkk1 
expression in CMV-Msx2Tg+ were reduced by approximately 80% 
as compared with those in nontransgenic littermates. Similarly, 
the levels of the canonical Wnt agonist Wnt3a were upregulated 
3-fold. Thus, augmented aortic Msx2 expression reduces expression 
of Dkk1 while upregulating expression of specific Wnt ligands.
Human parathyroid hormone (PTH1–34), a parathyroid hormone type 1 
receptor (PTH1R) agonist that suppresses vascular calcification in vitro, 
downregulates vascular mesenchymal Msx2-Wnt signaling. In addition, 
PTH1R agonists have been shown to inhibit VSMC calcification 
in vitro (35), and we recently demonstrated that 1 such agonist, 
teriparatide, also known as PTH1–34, suppresses cardiovascular 
calcification in vivo (19). PTH1–34 was shown to suppress aortic 
Msx2 mRNA accumulation in vivo and Msx2 expression in vitro 
in cultured aortic adventitial myofibroblasts (19). Therefore, to

further establish the relationships between aortic Msx2-Wnt 
signaling and vascular calcification, we examined the effects of 
PTH1–34 on the dynamics of vascular Msx2-Wnt signaling. As 
shown in Figure 8, PTH1–34 treatment concomitantly suppressed 
Msx2, Wnt3a, and Wnt7a expression in aortic tissues (Figure 
8A). PTH1–34 had little if any effect on aortic BMP2 mRNA accu￾mulation. PTH1–34 actions occurred in part via direct actions on 
the myofibroblast PTH1R; in cultured aortic myofibroblasts, 
teriparatide inhibited BMP2-augmented expression of Msx2, 
Wnt3a, and Wnt7a (Figure 8B). Consistent with 
this, PTH1–34 suppressed BMP2 activation of Smad￾dependent transcription from a multimerized 
Smad cognate (Figure 8C). Furthermore, PTH1–34
inhibited Wnt3a activation of the multifunctional 
Msx2 enhancer (36) (Figure 8D) but had little effect 
on basal transcription from these reporters (Figure 
8 and data not shown). Thus, PTH1–34, a PTH1R 
agonist that suppresses vascular calcification (19), 
concomitantly suppresses Msx2 induction and expression of vas￾cular canonical Wnts that are targets of Msx2.
TCF/LEF1 optimal promoter–galactosidase reporter mice transgenic 
for CMV-Msx2 (TOPGAL+;CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice) exhibit higher levels 
of vascular LacZ reporter expression as compared with nontransgenic 
littermates. We wished to evaluate whether augmented aortic Msx2 
expression enhances canonical Wnt signaling in vivo. Thus, we 
studied effects of the Msx2 transgene on Wnt-dependent TCF/
LEF1 transcription using TOPGAL mice (37). In TOPGAL mice, 
expression of LacZ from a LEF-driven transgene is entrained to 
TCF/LEF1-dependent transcription. CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice were 
crossed with TOPGAL mice and aortic LacZ expression com￾pared between CMV-Msx2Tg+;TOPGAL and nontransgenic 
TOPGAL siblings. TOPGAL+Msx2+ mice express higher levels 
(P = 0.04, n = 5–7 animals per group) of LacZ mRNA in the aorta 
as compared with TOPGAL+ mice (Figure 9). No augmentation of 
GAPDH mRNA accumulation was observed. Histochemistry for 
aortic LacZ confirmed that TCF/LEF signaling was activated in

Thus, the LacZ reporter is augmented in TOPGAL+Msx2+ com￾pared with TOPGAL+ control siblings, indicating enhanced aortic 
Wnt signaling in response to Msx2 expression.
Discussion
Demer and colleagues first identified the expression of the bone 
morphogen BMP2 by pericytic myofibroblasts in segments of 
human calcifying artery (8). These VSMC α-actin+ myofibro￾blasts form alizarin red–staining calcified nodules, which contain 
mineralized calcium phosphate at the stoichiometric signature 
of hydroxyapatite (8). We determined that both BMP2 and Msx2 
are upregulated in aortic adventitial and valve myofibroblasts in 
LDLR–/– mice fed high fat diets (10, 14). Our in vitro studies dem￾onstrated that Msx2 promotes the osteogenic differentiation and 
mineralization of primary aortic mesenchymal progenitors and 
10T1/2 cells. Msx2 upregulates ALP activity while suppressing 
competitive regulatory programs necessary for adipogenesis (10) 
— an observation confirmed by others (38). We now extend our 
analyses to demonstrate pro-osteogenic actions of aortic Msx2 
expression in vivo. On the C57Bl/6 background (LDLR+), non￾transgenic mice are resistant to vascular calcification, even when 
placed on high-fat diets for 16 weeks. In contrast, CMV-Msx2Tg+
siblings exhibit vascular calcification in aortic tunica media, 
coronary artery tunica media, and ventricular myocardium of 
adjacent right ventricular outflow. The CMV promoter has been 
demonstrated to direct expression of genes in subsets of vascular 
myofibroblasts and endothelial cells in transgenic mice (28). In 
our transgenic model, we noted that the calcifying vascular cells 
(CVCs) of the coronary and aortic tunica media were adjacent to 
populations of adventitial cells expressing Msx2. This suggests 
that Msx2 expression in adventitia may alter the mineralizing 
potential of neighboring mural CVCs. Consistent with this, we 
showed that the CM from Msx2-expressing 10T1/2 mesenchymal 
cells is biologically active. We determined that Msx2 augments 
expression of canonical (22, 23) Wnt agonists, suppresses the 
antagonist Dkk1, and promotes nuclear localization of β-catenin 
and activation of TCF/LEF1 transcription. Since recombinant 
Dkk1 partially reverses Msx2-dependent ALP induction and the 
suppression of adipogenesis, this provides independent evidence 
for canonical Wnt signaling in Msx2 actions. Although canonical 
Wnt signaling has been shown to upregulate Msx2 expression (36, 
39), to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that canoni￾cal Wnt signaling is activated by Msx2.
The observation that mesenchymal cells that express Msx2 
elaborate paracrine Wnt signals has important implications for 
the pathobiology of vascular calcification. The tunica adventitia 
provides microvascularization, nutrient supply, and mesenchymal 
progenitors to the outer half of the tunica media in large ves￾sels (40, 41). Based upon our results, we propose that induction 
of Msx2 signaling — first noted in adventitial myofibroblasts 
(14) — results in regionally augmented canonical Wnt signaling. 
Since the vector of microvascular flow is from tunica adventitia 
to tunica media (42), signals elaborated by adventitial myofibro￾blasts exert influences on medial cells via paracrine Wnt signals.

The CMV-Msx2 transgene suppresses aortic Dkk1 and enhances 
aortic Wnt3a expression. Total RNA was isolated from individual 
aortas of male CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice and nontransgenic male siblings, 
and relative accumulation of Msx2 and LRP5/6 ligands was quanti￾fied by fluorescence RT-PCR. Data are expressed as the relative 
aortic mRNA accumulation in CMV-Msx2Tg+ compared with that in 
non-Tg control siblings (18S normalized). As observed in vitro, Msx2 
expression decreases Dkk1 expression but enhances Wnt3a mRNA 
accumulation. *P < 0.05.

Msx2 suppresses Dkk1 but induces Wnt3a and Wnt7a mRNA. RNA 
was extracted from aortic myofibroblasts (A) or 10T1/2 cells (B) 
transduced with virus expressing either LacZ (control) or Msx2 and 
mRNA for LRP5/6 ligands quantified by fluorescence RT-PCR. Data 
are expressed as the relative mRNA accumulation in cells expressing 
Msx2 compared with that in cells expressing LacZ (18S normalized). 
Basal levels of mRNA accumulation were similar in naive and SFG￾LacZ control cells (not shown). Dkk1 is suppressed by Msx2, while 
Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and Wnt7a are induced. In primary cells, Wnt7a
was induced 192 ± 6.3 fold (P < 0.001; not shown). Note that Msx2 had 
no effect on LRP5 or LRP6 mRNA in primary myofibroblasts but that it 
weakly induced LRP5 mRNA in 10T1/2 cells. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.001.

of the tunica media in response to mural injury has been identified 
(40); such stem cells may become programmed in the adventitia 
and contribute to the CVC pool in the microenvironment of the 
tunica media. Indeed, surgical resection of the adventitia mark￾edly reduces segmental medial artery calcification in a rat model 
of calcific vasculopathy (43). Such functional spatial relationships 
would help explain the circumferential pattern of medial artery 
calcification prevalent in diabetes. Adventitial genomic responses 
to diabetes and dyslipidemia, recently characterized as arising in 
response to low-grade oxidative stress and inflammation (7), have 
been known for decades (44). In our models, high-fat diets are 
required to robustly elicit calcification in genetically susceptible 
animals — even those with the Msx2 transgene (data not shown); 
future studies will assess whether it is the adventitial inflamma￾tion and oxidative stressors of diabetes that augment adventitial 
and medial Wnt-signaling cascades.
The observation that Msx2-Wnt signaling is suppressed by 
teriparatide not only confirms the functional relationship between 
Msx2 and Wnt (Figure 11) but also provides insights into the 
endocrine pharmacology of vascular calcification. Intermittent 
teriparatide suppresses cardiovascular calcification and aortic 
myofibroblast Msx2 expression (19). Consistent with our data 
showing that Wnt3a and Wnt7a are vascular targets of Msx2 pro￾osteogenic actions, teriparatide suppresses aortic expression of 
these genes; BMP2, the bone morphogen upstream of Msx2 in this 
osteogenic signaling cascade (10, 45), is not affected by teripara￾tide. This suggests that PTH1–34 inhibits aspects of BMP2 signal￾ing in vascular myofibroblasts. Indeed, PTH1–34 inhibits BMP2-
induced expression of Msx2, Wnt3a, and Wnt7a. Moreover, PTH1–34
inhibits transcriptional activation by both BMP2 and Wnt3a. Like 
PTH1–34, parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP) also sig￾nals primarily through the PTH1R receptor in vascular smooth 
muscle cells, but via paracrine actions (35). PTHrP suppresses ALP 
expression and calcium deposition in VSMCs (35) and controls 
neointima formation (46). Conversely, the PTH1R antagonist 
PTHrP7–34 enhances ALP expression and calcium deposition in 
vitro (35). ESRD is associated with profound changes in PTH1R 
signaling, with skeletal resistance to PTH1R activation and sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism contributing to major abnormali￾ties in systemic calcium metabolism (47). Antagonistic fragments 
of PTH such as PTH7–84 accumulate in ESRD; these fragments 
bind and downregulate cell-surface PTH1R without signaling 
(48), thus inducing tissue resistance to both endocrine (PTH) and 
paracrine (PTHrP) signaling via this receptor or other C-terminal 
domain receptors (49). Thus, if our working model holds (Figure 
11), the pathobiology of medial artery calcification in ESRD may 
be accelerated by hyperparathyroidism-induced tachyphylaxis to 
vascular PTH1R signaling — an endocrinopathy that subsequently

unleashes pro-osteogenic vascular injury responses. Future studies 
will directly test this notion.
Our study has several important limitations. First, we used the 
CMV promoter to enhance aortic Msx2 expression in vivo. CMV￾Msx2Tg+ mice have been previously validated for the study of gain￾of-function features of Msx2 relevant to ectopic calvarial suture 
mineralization (26) and represented a logical choice for our initial 
studies. Unlike the relatively nonselective transcriptional activity 
exhibited following transient transfection, the CMV immediate 
early promoter exhibits cell-type specificity in transgenic mice 
(28). Using the LacZ reporter, Baskar et al. (28) demonstrated that, 
although the CMV promoter drives expression in multiple organs, 
expression is restricted to specific cell types in each organ, includ￾ing endothelial cells and certain VSMCs (28). We detected Msx2 
immunoreactivity primarily in aortic adventitial cells and cardiac 
myofibroblasts (10, 14). Using transduced aortic adventitial myo￾fibroblasts (VSMC α-actin+), we’ve demonstrated that these cells 
can and do contribute to Msx2-dependent actions (10). However, 
the broader specificity of the CMV promoter precludes us from 
unambiguously identifying a single cell type as the source of all 
Msx2-dependent signaling. In addition to pericytic myofibro￾blasts, microvascular endothelial cells may contribute to respons￾es. Second, the origins of vascular osteogenic progenitors have yet 
to be precisely mapped. Detailed analysis is currently limited in 
part because validated stage-specific markers of the myofibroblast 
lineage are lacking. Our ex vivo data coupled with our previous in 
situ hybridization studies indicate that adventitial myofibroblasts 
contribute to calcification responses (10, 14, 19). Since adventitial 
myofibroblasts are migratory (40), cells mobilized via prolifera￾tive expansion of the tunica adventitia may robustly calcify in the 
environment of the tunica media. However, Demer and colleagues 
have identified a subpopulation of resident cells in the tunica 
media — the CVC — that express pericytic myofibroblast markers, 
elaborate ALP, and deposit minerals in response to oxidized ste￾rols and monocyte inflammatory signals (2, 6, 50, 51). Since CVCs 
represent 10–30% of the medial cell population (50), the relative 
contribution of media versus adventitial osteogenic progenitors to 
mural calcification has yet to be established. The adventitial Sca1+
cell may represent the postnatal progenitor to all mural myofibro￾blast cell types (52). The patchy ventricular myofibroblast expres￾sion of the CMV-Msx2 transgene may recruit similar calcifying 
progenitors. In our models, high-fat diets are necessary to induce 
robust vascular calcification (ref. 14 and data not shown); thus, 
some diet-regulated metabolic parameter, potentially a phos￾pholipid or oxidized sterol (6, 8, 51), synergizes with Msx2-Wnt 
signaling to drive medial calcification. Of note, surgical resection 
of the adventitia reduces segmental medial artery calcification 
(43); whether this arises from loss of adventitial pro-osteogenic 
paracrine signals, reductions in the vascular osteoprogenitor 
pool, or a combination of both is unknown. Cell surface mark￾ers that stratify vascular myofibroblast stages of development are 
currently lacking, but will be necessary to identify precisely how 
Msx2-Wnt signaling controls the fate of vascular mesenchymal 
cells. Finally, the specific Wnt milieu regulating vascular calci￾fication is unknown; 19 murine Wnt genes exist. We noted that 
both canonical agonists (Wnt3a, Wnt7) and noncanonical ligands 
(Wnt5) that inhibit canonical Wnt actions were upregulated by 
Msx2. The induction of ALP enzyme activity, a target of canonical 
Wnt signaling (11), is a key event, since ALP hydrolyzes organic

these were histochemically stained for LacZ (37). Two animals of each genotype 
were studied. Note the greater number of medial cells elaborating the LacZ reporter

not observed in the tunica adventitia (A and D) but was very intense in the valvular

Figure 11
Working model of Msx2 actions during vascular calcification. High-fat 
diets upregulate aortic BMP2 expression (10). In addition to providing 
progenitors for medial disease processes (40, 41, 43), Msx2-express￾ing adventitial myofibroblasts produce an osteogenic milieu via induc￾tion of Wnt agonists and inhibition of the LRP5/6 antagonist, Dkk1. This 
causes nuclear localization and activation of β-catenin — an indispens￾able coregulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization (24); 
as reflected by TCF/LEF-dependent transcription, activation occurs in 
a subset of medial CVCs. CVCs of Demer (50), perhaps derived from 
migratory adventitial progenitors (10, 40, 41, 43), respond by upregu￾lating ALP expression via key osteogenic transcription factors (11). 
Vascular PTH1R signaling dampens Msx2-Wnt signaling. In ESRD, 
PTH1R downregulation (desensitization) arising from hyperparathy￾roidism may accelerate vascular disease. Although Osx is upregulated 
by Msx2 (10), the relationship between β-catenin:TCF/LEF signaling 
(24) and Osx (60) in mineralization has yet to be clarified. The pyro￾phosphate-generating (PPi-generating) enzyme ENPP1 inhibits arte￾rial calcification, stabilizing the VSMC phenotype (55).

phosphates to generate inorganic phosphate for mineral depo￾sition; this includes pyrophosphate, a mineralization inhibitor 
(18, 53). The relative contribution of canonical and noncanonical 
Wnts to vascular disease processes has yet to be explored. Since the 
adventitia only very weakly stains for calcium with alizarin red, 
signals must exist that inhibit ALP induction and mineralization 
in this compartment; Wnt5 family members (54) and ectonucleo￾tide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) (18, 55, 56) 
represent attractive candidates. Future studies will relate spatial 
and temporal patterns of vascular ENPP expression to ALP as 
regulated by Msx2 and Wnt signaling.
Methods
Materials. TOPFLASH (contains tandem TCF/LEF1 responsive elements 
upstream of the LUC reporter) was provided by Fanxin Long (Washing￾ton University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). SMAD-LUC (contains tandem 
Smad responsive elements upstream of the LUC reporter) was provided 
by Xu Cao (University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, USA). Wnt3a 
containing CM (Wnt3a-CM) was prepared from L cells that express Wnt3a 
(ATCC; CRL-2647); CM from wild-type L cells was used as a negative con￾trol. Rabbit anti–β-catenin was from Cell Signaling Technology. Goat 
anti-human Dkk1 (no. AF1096) and goat anti-SOST (no. AF1589) were 
obtained from R&D Systems. Goat anti-Msx2 (sc-17729), goat anti-ALP 
(tissue nonspecific ALP; sc-23430), and mouse anti–β-actin (sc-8432) were 
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Other reagents were from 
Fisher Scientific and Sigma-Aldrich.
Transduction, transfection, and assays of lineage allocation and canonical Wnt 
signaling in 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells. Transduction of 10T1/2 cells by SFG￾Msx2 retrovirus was performed as described (10). Cells transduced with 
SFG-LacZ were routinely used as negative controls. CM from SFG-LacZ– 
or SFG-Msx2–transduced 10T1/2 cells was harvested every 3 days for 10 
days from confluent cultures and stored at –80°C until use. For osteo￾genesis assays, confluent 10T1/2 cells were treated every 2 to 3 days with 
CM diluted with culture medium (10% FBS in Eagle’s basal medium) to 
50% or 80% strength (vol/vol). ALP activity was measured 9 days later as 
described (10). For adipogenesis, confluent cells were treated with the 
indicated CM containing 0.1 μM dexamethasone, 50 μM indomethacin, 
and 5 μg/ml insulin for 13 days. Adipocyte number was counted after oil 
red O staining (10). As indicated, 1 μg/ml recombinant purified Dkk1 
protein (see below) was added to culture conditions. To detect activity of 
canonical Wnts in CM, 10T1/2 cells were transfected with TOPFLASH; 
6 hours later, cells were treated with 70% (vol/vol) LacZ-CM or Msx2-
CM for 48 hours and LUC reporter activity measured as described (10). 
The eukaryotic expression vector for EGFP-Msx2 fusion protein was con￾structed in pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences).
Real-time fluorescence RT-PCR. To measure relative mRNA lev￾els of Wnt/Dkk1-signaling molecules, fluorescence RT-PCR was 
performed as detailed (19). Validated amplimers were: Msx2, 5′-
ACCACGTCCCAGCTTCTAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTGCGATGGAGA￾GGTACTG-3′; Wnt3a, 5′-CATGCACCTCAAGTGCAAATG-3′ and 
5′-TGAGGAAATCCCCGATGGT-3′; Wnt5b, 5′-TGTGGAGACAACGT￾GGAGTACG-3′ and 5′-TGTAGGTTCATGAGAGCTCGGC-3′; Wnt7a, 
5′-TGGATGCCCGGGAGATC-3′ and 5′- CCGACCCGCCTCGTTATT￾3′; Dkk1, 5′-GCTGCATGACGCACGCTAT-3′ and 5′-AGAGGGCATG￾CATATTCCATTT-3′; Dkk2, 5′-CACACTCCAAGATGCCTCATATAAA-3′
and 5′-AAAACCCATCAATGCAGTCTGA-3′; LRP5, 5′-GAGCGAGGAG￾GCCATCAA-3′ and 5′-GCCCGAGATGACAATGTTCTG-3′; LRP6, 5′-
TGTGGGCCTGACCGTGTT-3′ and 5′-TTCGAGCCTGGACCTTGGT-3′; 
LacZ, 5′-TGGCGTTACCCAACTTAATCG-3′ and 5′-GCGGGCCTCTTC￾GCTATTAC-3′. Relative mRNA abundance was calculated as percentage 
of GAPDH or 18S RNA in each sample. Amplimers for 18S and GAPDH 
have been described (19).
Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Cell pellets and aortic tis￾sues were rinsed with PBS, then extracted at 4°C with a hand-held Tis￾sue-Tearor rotary homogenizer (BioSpec Products Inc.) in 5 volumes of 20 
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 
mM DTT, 1 nM okadaic acid, and 0.1 μM sodium vanadate, supplemented 
with a comprehensive protease inhibitor cocktail. After centrifugation, 30 
μg of whole cell or tissue protein extract was resolved by SDS-PAGE then 
electotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.); proteins 
were immunovisualized by Western blot (57). In subconfluent cultures, 
indirect immunofluorescence was used to localize β-catenin in 10T1/2 
cells transduced with SFG-LacZ or SFG-Msx2 as previously detailed (57). 
ALP was visualized by Vector Red ALP substrate kit VC-SK-5100 as recom￾mended by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories).
Generation of recombinant purified Dkk1. Dkk1 coding sequence was obtained 
from human aorta cDNA (BD Biosciences — Clontech) using PCR to intro￾duce 5′-NdeI and 3′-BamI sites, then cloned into pET16b (EMD Biosciences). 
Dkk1 protein was purified following the Prockop protocol (58). SDS-PAGE, 
Western blot analysis, and inhibition of Wnt3a-induced TOPFLASH activa￾tion in transfected 10T1/2 cells were used to characterize Dkk1 preparations 
prior to implementation in osteogenesis and adipogenesis assays.
CMV-Msx2 and TOPGAL+;CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice (C57Bl/6 background) 
were generated essentially as described (26). A single line yielding Msx2 
transgene expression was analyzed. The pcDNA3-Msx2 expression 
construct DT21.14 (21) was digested with BglII and NruI to release the 
3.2-kb fragment encoding the CMV immediate early promoter, mouse 
Msx2 cDNA (N-terminal Met-FLAG), bovine growth hormone 3′-UTR, and 
the polyadenylation signal (from pcDNA3; Invitrogen Corp.). This frag￾ment was gel-purified with QIEX II (QIAGEN) silica resin, acetate-ethanol 
precipitated, resolubilized in transgene buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.1 mM 
EDTA; 20 μl per 2000 ng of DNA), and transgenic mice generated via male 
C57Bl/6 pronuclear injection (Washington University Mouse Genetics 
Core). PCR genotyping for the CMV-Msx2-bGHpolyA transgene was direct￾ed toward juxtaposed Msx2 cDNA (5′-TGTGCTCCCCATCCCGCCTGTT￾GGACTCTA-3′) and vector 3′-UTR sequences (5′-AAGGACAGTGGGAGT￾GGCACCTTCCAGGGT-3′) following the protocol of Stratman (59). 
TOPGAL mice (37) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (genotyping 
amplimers: 5′-GAGTGACGGCAGTTATCTGGAAGATCAGGA-3′ and 
5′-GGAAACCGACATCGCAGGCTTCTGCTTCAATCA-3′). TOPGAL mice 
were bred with CMV-Msx2Tg+ mice to generate CMV-Msx2Tg+;TOPGAL+
animals on a mixed C57Bl/6-CD1 background. Comparisons of LacZ 
mRNA and activity were made between CMV-Msx2Tg+;TOPGAL+ and
TOPGAL+ littermate controls.
Cardiovascular histochemistry, immunohistchemistry, and serum biochemistry. 
Animals were fed Picolab Rodent Diet 20 (no. 5053) until challenged, 
beginning at 6 weeks, with high-fat diet for 16 weeks (Harlan Teklad, 
TD88137) (14). Male mice were exsanguinated under anesthesia (19). Ani￾mal care and experimental use was approved by the Animal Studies Com￾mittee and Review Board of Washington University School of Medicine, 
St. Louis, Missouri, USA. The heart and ascending aorta were harvested 
and paraffin sections analyzed for calcium deposition by alizarin red histo￾chemistry (19). Msx2 (1:50) and ALP (1:200) were immunolocalized using 
cognate goat anti-sera, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti￾goat antibodies (1:200), and diaminobenzidine histochemistry (56). After 
chloroform-methanol extraction of serum phospholipids, aqueous serum 
phosphorus and calcium concentrations were determined using commer￾cially available assays purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Statistics. Analyses were performed using Student’s unpaired t test, with 
data presented as the mean ± SEM (10, 19).
