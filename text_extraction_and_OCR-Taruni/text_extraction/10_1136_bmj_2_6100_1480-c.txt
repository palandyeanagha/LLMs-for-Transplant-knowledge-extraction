continuing and expanding research on the
treatment of this condition, which is at present
responsible for considerable personal distress
and social disruption. In view of the large
numbers of women between the menarche and
the menopause who suffer from PMS any
significant reduction in its overall incidence
will be welcome and we hope that family
doctors will be encouraged to treat PMS by
these new approaches. Further help and
support from specialised clinics in teaching
hospitals and other centres will be required for
some time yet, but we hope soon to publish
further observations on the clinical presenta￾tion of PMS which will minimise this need.

Anaphylaxis after dichloralphenazone
treatment
SIR,-The case of anaphylactic response to the
ingestion of dichloralphenazone (Welldorm)
tablets (reported by Dr Steven Perl, 5 Novem￾ber, p 1187) is by no means unique.
Two Welldorm tablets were administered
as night sedation to a 55-year-old man awaiting
a minor surgical operation. Within minutes
he developed severe bronchospasm and a
widespread bullous skin eruption. The
bronchospasm responded readily to injection
of hydrocortisone and aminophylline. By the
following morning there was no evidence of
any lesion.

Silk sutures in the common bile duct
SIR,-Having twice had a similar experience
to that described by Mr B I Rees and Mr G
Jacob (12 November,p 1265)-although on both
occasions the recurrent common bile duct
stone contained a thread rather than a silk
suture-I was interested last year to remove
three stones from the common duct of a
woman who had had a cholecystectomy eight
years before. Each stone contained a thread
suture, and reference to the excellent original
operation note produced the explanation:
the cystic duct and two cystic arteries had
been tied with thread.
I agree that it is important that no un￾absorbable suture should be used in the vicinity
of the common duct. It is not uncommon to
find that surgeons in training recognise this
risk so far as the cystic duct ligature is con￾cerned, but many are unaware that the cystic
artery tie also may discharge itself into the
common duct. The chances of this happening
are presumably greater if an exploration of the
common duct has been performed, but a small
abscess around the foreign body on the artery
can undoubtedly discharge into the lumen of
the nearby common duct even when its wall is
surgically intact.

Anaphylactoid reactions to dextran 70
SIR,-I read with interest the report by Dr
L H Fanous and others of two cases of ana￾phylactic reaction to dextran 70 (5 November,
p 1189).
The cases which we reported last year'
had no history of asthma and did not develop
urticarial rashes. Investigation of the immuno￾logical aspects of these cases did not reveal the
cause. It is peculiar that in our hospital there
have been no cases of this type reported in
the general surgical or medical wards and that
the syndrome appears to be associated with
maternity cases.
The question of particles in the dextran
solutions and bacteriological contamination
of these solutions were investigated with
negative results at the time. As an anaesthetist
I have meanwhile continued to give dextran
as a prophylaxis against deep venous throm￾bosis in orthopaedic cases, but more recently
there has been apprehension about dextran
as a precipitating factor in postoperative acute
renal failure, as a result of a paper by Feest,2
and the practice here now is to not give
dextran to those orthopaedic patients who
have a blood urea concentration higher than
normal for their age.

Lichen-planus-like eruption: a marker
for chronic graft-versus-host reaction
SIR,-In regard to your leading article (23
July, p 211) on skin changes after bone marrow
transplantation we would like to make the
following comments. Since our initial report' 2
of four patients with lichen-planus-like
eruption (LPLE) after bone marrow trans￾plantation we have seen seven additional
cases.' We have found that the clinical spec￾trum of LPLE may be compared to the various
clinical aspects of idiopathic lichen planus
(ILP). The occurrence of LPLE after bone
marrow graft not only would throw light on
the pathogenesis of ILP2 3 but also has a
practical interest in the management of
patients after grafting.
Indeed, we have found that: (1) a graft￾versus-host reaction always precedes develop￾ment of the LPLE; (2) LPLE never occurs
if the graft is rejected; and (3) LPLE always
occurs in a context of "persistent graft￾versus-host reaction." These data strongly
support the concept of LPLE actually
representing a skin manifestation of graft￾versus-host disease.3 In every case the first
symptoms of LPLE were found in the mouth.
This oral involvement was very similar to
ILP; it can be easily recognised by a der￾matologist and is quite different from drug￾induced erosive leucokeratosis and from can￾didiasis. The oral LPLE represents, therefore,
a useful early marker of chronic graft-versus￾host disease and a tool for clinical evaluation
and therapeutic guidance in patients under￾going bone marrow transplantation.

Adverse reactions to intravenous
thiopentone
SIR,-We were interested to read the article
by Drs J M Evans and J A M Keogh (17
September, p 735) in which they reported
three histaminoid-type reactions to the
intravenous use of thiopentone. In view of the
relative rarity of adverse reactions to this
agent' we would like to report a further case.
A 33-year-old White man underwent a routine
repair of a right inguinal hernia. Routine pre￾medication with atropine plus Omnopon was given
and intravenous thiopentone and suxamethonium
used for induction of anaesthesia. The operation
was uneventful. Postoperatively the patient de￾veloped severe bronchospasm, generalised
erythema, pruritus, and gross facial oedema. His
white cell count remained normal but showed a
6 eosinophilia. Treatment was instituted with
high-dose steroids and the antihistamine chlor￾pheniramine. The bronchospasm settled rapidly,
but the erythema and oedema gradually resolved
over the following 72 h.
This patient had a known hypersensitivity to
penicillin and tetanus toxoid and eight years
previously had undergone an operation for treat￾ment of a compound fracture of his right lower
leg. In view of the common use of thiopentone for
induction, it is likely that previous use had sensi￾tised the patient to this agent, resulting in a type 1
hypersensitivity reaction on re-exposure.
As noted by Drs Evans and Keogh,
histaminoid-type reactions are probably en￾countered more frequently than reported and
it would seem justified to advocate the
prophylactic use of an antihistamine in patients
known to be hypersensitive to exogenous
agents.

Bell's palsy and herpes simplex
SIR,-Dr B E Juel-Jensen (22 October,
p 1086) has taken exception to the evidence
that I presented (24 September, p 829) which
appeared to support the hypothesis that Bell's
palsy may be associated with herpes simplex
virus (HSV) infection. While his own studies,
to which we are given no reference, resulted
in a conclusion contrary to three of the
references I cited, he is correct to confirm that
there is no definite proof of the association.
However, in his determination to demonstrate
that the patient in my report did not have
