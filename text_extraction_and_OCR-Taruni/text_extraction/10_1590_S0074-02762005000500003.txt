A hemodialysis population from a dialysis unit in the city of Recife, Northeastern Brazil, was screened to assess
the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and to investigate the associated risk factors. Hemodialysis
patients (n = 250) were interviewed and serum samples tested for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All samples were also tested for HCV RNA by reverse transcriptase nested poly￾merase chain reaction (RT-nested-PCR). Out of 250 patients, 21 (8.4%) were found to be seropositive by ELISA, and
19 (7.6%) patients were HCV RNA positive. HCV viraemia was present in 90.5% of the anti-HCV positive patients.
The predominant genotype was HCV 1a (8/19), followed by 3a (7/19), and 1b (4/19). None of the anti-HCV negative
patients were shown to be viraemic by the PCR. Univariate analysis of risk factors showed that time spent on
hemodialysis, the number of blood transfusions and a blood transfusion before November 1993 were associated with
HCV positivity. However, multivariate analysis revealed that blood transfusions before November 1993 were signifi￾cantly associated with HCV infection in this population. Low prevalence levels were encountered in this center,
however prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings.
Key words: prevalence - risk factors - hemodialysis - genotypes - hepatitis C virus - polymerase chain reaction - Recife - Brazil
Hemodialysis patients are at high risk of hepatitis C
infection. Some factors are especially related with these
high prevalence rates, such as blood transfusions and
length of dialysis time (Cardoso et al. 1994, Salama et al.
2000, Carneiro et al. 2001, Santana et al. 2001, Hinrichsen
et al. 2002).
In 2000, the Brazilian Ministry of Health published
guidelines for dialysis units, setting rigorous rules to im￾prove this treatment procedure and thus lower mortality
and morbidity rates (Ministério da Saúde 2004). These
rules determine that hepatitis C serology had to be ana￾lyzed semestrally to avoid viral spreading throughout
these units.
The guidelines had to be implemented correctly in or￾der to reduce potential virus cross-contamination among
patients and staff.
The aims of this study were: (1) to determine the preva￾lence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in hemodialysis
patients from a center in the city of Recife (Brazil); (2) to
detect HCV infection by serology and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) among these patients; (3) to investigate
associated risk factors, such as the number of blood trans￾fusions and time spent on hemodialysis; and (4) to iden￾tify the HCV genotypes in this population by molecular
method.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects - The study was carried out at a dialysis unit
in the city of Recife, Northeastern Brazil, between March
and June 2002; 257 chronic hemodialysis patients were
interviewed at the unit to establish any risk factors for
HCV infection. The studied population ranged in age from
17 to 92 years (average 46 years); 147 of the patients were
males (58.8%) and 103 were females (41.2%).
A standardized form was used to collect data regard￾ing age, sex, length of time spent on hemodialysis, the
number of blood transfusions, any blood transfusion be￾fore November 1993, any tattooing, and intravenous drug
use. The study protocol was submitted and approved by
the Ethical Committee of the Adolfo Lutz Institute and of
the Health Science Center of the Federal University of
Pernambuco. Consent was obtained from all patients.
Dialysis center - The HCV positive patients of the
center studied realized the hemodialysis treatment in the
reserved machines and separate rooms to reprocess dia￾lyzers from anti-HCV positive and anti-HCV negative pa￾tients were observed.
Serum samples - Blood samples were collected from
250 patients. These samples were separated into three
aliquots, one for serological tests, another for PCR and
the third reserved for any necessary result confirmation.
The sera were stored at –20ºC and –70ºC.
Anti-HCV serological tests - To study the prevalence
of HCV infection in this population, all serum samples
were analyzed by a third-generation enzyme immunoas￾say (Murex anti-HCV version 4.0) following
manufacturer’s instructions. Samples with results rang￾ing from 0.667 to 0.815 (signal/cutoff ratio) were consid-

ered indeterminate ELISA results. Samples with indeter￾minate results were tested by a third-generation recombi￾nant Immunoblot (IB, CHIRON RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA). These
tests included recombinants antigens (c33C e NS5) and
synthetic peptide (5-1-1, c100, c22). Samples with a nega￾tive PCR result and reactive in the ELISA were also sub￾mitted to IB testing.
PCR technique - HCV-RNA detection by PCR was
carried out on all serum samples. A reverse transcriptase￾nested PCR was used to amplify a fragment of the 5'
untranslated region (5'UTR) of the HCV genome. Serum
RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies) with
primers PTC1 (5'CGTTAGTATGAGTGTCGTGC3') and
NCR2 (5'ATACTCGAGGTGCACGGTCTACGAGACCT3')
in the first amplification round. For the second amplifi￾cation round, primers PTC3 (5'AGTGTCGTGCA
GCCTCCAGG3') and NCR4 (5'CACTCTCGAGCACCC
TATCAGGCAGT3') were used (Garson et al. 1990a,b). In
each reaction set, water samples were used as negative
controls to exclude possible cross contaminations due to
amplicon carry-over.
HCV genotyping - PCR products were submitted to
cycle sequencing reactions, using the second round prim￾ers described above and the ABI prism BigDye Termi￾nator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with
AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, FS (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, US). Nucleotide sequences from both
strands were determined using an automated DNA se￾quencer model ABI 377 (Applied Biosystems). For
genotyping, sequences were compared with those previ￾ously published using the Lasergene package (DNAstar,
Madison, WI, US).
Prevalence - The following criterion was used to con￾sider a patient as HCV infected: any sample with a posi￾tive result in at least two of three tests (PCR, ELISA, IB).
Prevalence was determined by the serological result ob￾tained.
Statistical analysis - The degree of agreement between
the techniques employed was measured by Kappa statis￾tics (Gordis 1996), which takes into account the agree￾ment that might be expected to occur by chance. Preva￾lence and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calcu￾lated. Chi-square tests were performed to evaluate risk
factors associated with HCV infection. Statistical signifi￾cance was assessed at the 0.05 probability level in all
analysis. Risk factors detected by univariate analysis were
analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Statistical evalu￾ations were performed using the Epi-Info 6.0 program and
SPSS PC program version 8.0.
RESULTS
Hundred forty seven male and 103 female patients aged
between 17-92 years were enrolled on the study. Of the
250 patients only one patient revealed an indeterminate
result by the ELISA and IB and negative result by the RT￾PCR in two samples collected during the following seven
month period. The result of the 250 patients tested for
HCV antibodies by third generation ELISA and for HCV￾RNA by RT/PCR with a detection limit of 100-genomes/ml
are shown in Table I. The seropositivity of the two pa￾tients only anti-HCV-positive by ELISA was confirmed
by the IB.
Of the 21 HCV positive patients, 14 of whom were men
(9.6%) and 14 had 40 years old and more (8.3%) p > 0.05.
The positivity rates did not differ between patients who
received blood transfusions (64.6%) and patients who did
not receive blood transfusions (35.3%). However,
univariate analysis showned that the length of time spent
on hemodialysis, the number of blood transfusions, and
blood transfusion before November 1993 were associated
with HCV positivity (Table II). Multivariate analysis re￾vealed that only blood transfusions before screening for
anti-HCV were significantly associated with HCV infec￾tion in this population (Table III).
HCV genotypes were identified in 19 HCV RNA posi￾tive samples. These results are shown in Table IV.

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to report on the prevalence and
genotyping of HCV in hemodialysis patients in the state
of Pernambuco, Brazil. The prevalence of 8.4% found in
the present study can be considered low when compared
with the prevalence of São Paulo, 14.6% (Moreira et al.
2003), of Curitiba, PR, 39.2% (Carvalho et al. 1999), of
Goiânia, GO, 46.7% (Carneiro et al. 2001), and of Belo
Horizonte, MG, 20% (Busek et al. 2002). However, in com￾parison with the prevalence index of hepatitis C through￾out the general population, the index observed in this
study was seven times higher (Ministério da Saúde 2003).
In the present study, PCR was used to screen for the
presence of HCV RNA in all 250 serum samples. The IB
test was used to confirm the presence of antibodies anti￾HCV in two patients with an absence of viraemia. More
recently, a transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)
assay has been developed with a lower limit of detection
on the order of 5 to 10 IU/ml. A follow-up qualitative HCV
RNA should be performed in the sample studied to con￾firm the absence of active HCV replication. The HCV RNA
was not detected in seronegative samples. The presence
of HCV viraemia in anti-HCV-negative hemodialysis pa￾tients has been frequently reported by other authors
(Cardoso et al. 1994, Fernández et al. 1996, Salama et al.
2000, Carneiro et al. 2001, Hinrichsen et al. 2002, Busek et
al. 2002, Moreira et al. 2003). However, some researchers

Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Vol. 100(5), August 2005 469
have not observed anti-HCV-negative hemodialysis pa￾tients with HCV RNA in the serum (Dalekos et al. 1998).
Multivariate analysis revealed that blood transfusions
before screening for anti-HCV, were significantly associ￾ated to HCV infection in this population. In addition, re￾vealed that patients who did receive blood transfusion
before November 1993 had a 2,73 fold (95% CI: 1,17-6,33)
greater risk of HCV positivity compared to subjects who
had received blood transfusion after November 1993.
The extensive use of recombinant erythropoietin to
correct renal anaemia in hemodialysis patients resulted in
a significant reduction in blood transfusions. The preva￾lence in the studied center was low, although a prospec￾tive study is necessary to confirm these findings.
A very important role must be attributed to the scru￾pulous and strict application of universal precautions (Gilli
et al. 1995) to reduce of environmental diffusions of C
hepatitis in dialysis units. A genuine transmission could
be caused by the leakage of blood or blood components
through the dialysis filter.
Alterations of pore size and micro-fractures of the
membrane are possible events in the course of manufac￾turing, during the dialysis session or with dialyzer re-use.
A second type of contamination is caused by occasional
or systematic contaminations of machine and instruments
(Sampietro et al. 1996).
In this study, an excellent use of universal precau￾tions was observed as well as the fact that reprocessed
dialyzers for anti-HCV positive and anti-HCV negative
patients were placed in separate rooms. Dialysis units that
placed reprocessed dialyzers in separate rooms had the
lowest incidence of C hepatitis (Pereira et al. 1999). The
anti-HCV positive hemodialysis patients of the studied
center received the treatment on reserved machines and
the staff members of this study paid careful attention to
hygiene and the strict sterilization of dialysis machines.
Molecular studies are useful to detect nosocomial
transmission of viral infections. The HCV strains were
characterized by genotyping the samples with positive
PCR by sequencing the 5'UTR. This is not the best region
to be sequenced since it represents the most conserved
region among HCV genotypes, but by choosing primers
from this region, it is possible to obtain a high sensitivity
test in a population in which multiple genotypes are rep￾resented (Zein et al. 2000).

In this study, genotypes 1a and 3a were detected in
the majority of samples. Genotype 1 is the most prevalent
genotype in the general population in Brazil. Differences
between viral genotypes may have major implications for
the current use of HCV diagnostic tests, especially in geo￾graphic areas with a high prevalence of HCV genotypes
that are phylogenetically distant from genotype 1a (Zein
et al. 2000).
This study does not demonstrate the occurrence of
false serological results (negative and positive), however
the effectiveness of PCR for early recognition of HCV
infection in patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment
is very important, and the spread of viral strains with the
same genotypes, could confirm eventually the possibility
of the HCV dissemination in the hemodialysis setting. The
homogeneity of the genotypes reflects a transmission
nosocomial. However, it is necessary to carry out retro￾spective and prospective studies at this center in order to
evaluate the time during which the patients acquire this
infection.
