Abstract
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a common inflammatory factor, which involves in various non-specific 
pathological processes of inflammation. It has been found that increased endothelial permeability
accompanied with high expression of IL-8 at site of injured endothelium and atherosclerotic plaque
at early stages, suggesting that IL-8 participated in regulating endothelial permeability in the de￾veloping processes of vascular disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate the regulation 
effects of IL-8 on the vascular endothelial permeability, and the mRNA and protein expression of 
tight junction components (i.e., ZO-1, Claudin-5 and Occludin). Endothelial cells were stimulated 
by IL-8 with the dose of 50, 100 and 200 ng/mL, and duration of 2, 4, 6, 8h, respectively. The mRNA 
and protein expression level of tight junction components with IL-8 under different concentration 
and duration was examined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Meanwhile, the integrins 
induced focal adhesions event with IL-8 stimulation was also investigated. The results showed that 
IL-8 regulated the permeability of endothelium by down-regulation of tight junction in a dose- and 
time-dependence manner, but was not by integrins induced focal adhesions. This finding reveals
the molecular mechanism in the increase of endothelial cell permeability induced by IL-8, which is 
expected to provide a new idea as a therapeutic target in vascular diseases.
Key words: Endothelial permeability; IL-8; Tight junction; Occludin; Claudin-5; ZO-1.
Introduction
Vascular endothelium is a semipermeable 
membrane, which could separate the inner and outer 
of vessel and regulate the exchange of dissolved gas￾es, ions and solutes between the inner and outer of 
vascular endothelium as an important barrier func￾tion [1]. The maintenance by the endothelium of a 
semi-permeable barrier is particularly essential for 
establishing the transendothelial protein gradient and 
maintaining the normal physiological functions of 
organs. The elevated permeability of endothelium 
means that it in part lost semipermeable characteris￾tics, which is a crucial pathological phenomenon in￾volved in the development of diseases, including
heart and lung edema [2], tumor angiogenesis [3] and 
shock [4-5]. Moreover, the loss of endothelial barrier 
function is the hallmark of inflammatory diseases 
such as atherosclerosis [6].
The dynamic equilibrium between cell adhesion 
and cytoskeleton contraction plays an important role 
in maintaining the normal function of endothelial 
permeability. It is known that intercellular junction, as 
an important structural basis of endothelial cell per￾meability, is mediated by adhesion structures, which 
can be divided into tight junction, gap junction and

adherent junction [7]. The function of gap junction 
involved in transmitting biochemical information 
among adjacent endothelial cells, while tight junction 
and adherent junction contributed to macromolecules 
transport.
Tight junction is located in the top side of the gap 
of adjacent cells, which is formed with a variety of 
proteins, and plays a critical role in the maintenance 
of stable internal environment and the normal func￾tions of body [7]. Changes in vascular permeability 
may result from alterations of the tight junction 
components. Tight junction is composed of a combi￾nation of more than 40 proteins including the trans￾membrane proteins Occludin, the Claudin family, the 
junction adhesion molecule (JAM) family, and pe￾ripheral membrane-associated Zonula occludens (ZO)
family [8]. Evidences have been provided for the 
presence of Occludin, Claudin-5, ZO-1, and JAM-A in 
vascular endothelium [9-11]. Therefore, changes in 
Occludin, Claudin-5, and ZO-1 likely contribute to 
alterations in vascular endothelial permeability in
response to stimulation of inflammatory cytokines.
On the other hand, the barrier function of tight junc￾tions regulates the passage of ions, water, and various 
macromolecules, even if cancer cells, through para￾cellular spaces to maintain tissue homeostasis. The 
vascular endothelium is a monolayer comprising of
not only endothelial cells but also extracellular matrix 
(ECM) proteins, indicating that under normal condi￾tions the permeability of the endothelium depends on
the combined properties of the cell layer and the ECM 
barriers in series [12]. ECM proteins, including fi￾bronectin (FN), laminin (LN), vitronectin (VN) and 
collagens (Col), bind to extracellular domains of in￾tegrin α subunits receptors on cell membrane, and 
transduce signals from extracellular stimuli to intra￾cellular events. Around activated integrin clusters on 
the cell membrane, cytoskeletal proteins (Talin, Paxil￾lin, Vinculin and so on) as the ligands of integrin β
cytoplasmic tails, assemble together to form focal ad￾hesion (FA) plaques and provide enough supports for 
cell adhesion on the substrate. Vinculin frequently 
links adhesion receptors (e.g. integrins) to the con￾tractile actin-myosin cytoskeleton by binding either 
talin through its amino-terminal globular head do￾main, or Paxillin through its rod-like tail domain [13]. 
Therefore, both cell-cell junction and cell-ECM adhe￾sion likely contribute to endothelial barrier function
[1].
The endothelial permeability is regulated by a 
variety of chemical and biological factors. Of these 
factors, the adhesion molecules, MCP-1, IL-8 and 
other chemotactic cytokines play key roles. IL-8 is a 
chemokine that increases endothelial permeability 
during early stages of angiogenesis, which involved 
in various non-specific inflammation pathological 
processes [14]. Some reports have proved that IL-8 has 
extensive functions in defensive reaction, immune 
reactions as well as inflammation [15]. Preliminary 
studies showed that IL-8 could activate the vascular 
endothelial cells and induce migration behaviors 
[16-17], and there was a high expression of IL-8 at 
endothelial cell injury and the atherosclerotic plaque
[18]. It has been reported that IL-8 induced endotheli￾al permeability required the activation of vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) [19]. 
Therefore, the question raised to us is how tight junc￾tion proteins would be changed involved in IL-8 in￾duced permeability. 
In this study, endothelial cells were stimulated 
by IL-8 with the doses of 50, 100 and 200 ng/mL for 2, 
4, 6 and 8 h, respectively. The changes of tight junc￾tion proteins (Occludin, Claudin-5 and ZO-1) in IL-8 
stimulated endothelial cells were examined. In addi￾tion, the proteins expression of integrins (α2, α5, β1 
and β3 subunits) and focal adhesion complexes (Talin, 
Vinculin and Paxillin) were examined to determine if 
integrins and their downstream signals participate in
permeability changes mediated by IL-8.

Human vascular endothelial cell lines, EA.hy926 
cells (provided by Hematology Research Institute of 
Jiangsu Province, China) were used in this study,

fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hangzhou Sijiqing Biological 
Engineering Materials Co., Ltd., China), 20 mmol/L

Santa CurzTM Biotechnology, Inc (CA, USA). The pe￾roxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat 
anti-rabbit IgG (secondary antibodies) were pur￾chased from Dingguo Biotechnology Co., LTD (Bei￾jing, China).
Permeability assay by Transwell
The endothelial permeability assay was per￾formed according to previous report [20]. Briefly, cells 
were cultured on Matrigel-coated transwell of 0.4 μm
pore size and then placed in 24-well culture plates for
grow 4-5 days at 100% confluent. Cells were washed 
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 times. To 
examine the effects of different concentrations and 
durations of IL-8 on endothelial permeability, the 
groups were designed as follows: 50, 100 and 200 
ng/ml IL-8 treated endothelial cells for 4 h and 100 
ng/ml IL-8 treated cells for 2, 4 and 8 h, respectively. 
Then FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin (Sigma, 
USA) was added into the top (luminal) chamber at a 
concentration of 1 mg/ml, and continued to culture 
for 1h. The transwell chambers were removed and 70 
μl culture medium was taken out from each bottom 
chambers, and fluorescence intensity was quantified 
using a fluorimeter (TBS-380 mini-FLuorometer sys￾tems, Turner BioSystemsTM, USA), with excitation at 
485 nm and emission at 535 nm, to provide an indi￾cator of relative endothelial permeability. Sample 
readings were converted with the use of a standard 
curve to albumin concentration. These concentrations 
were then used in the following equation to determine 
the permeability coefficient of albumin (Pa), 
where [Ca] was the abluminal concentration; t was 
time (s); S was the area of membrane(cm2); V was the 
volume of luminal chamber, and [Cl] was the luminal 
concentration [20].
Morphologic observation of IL-8 induced en￾dothelial permeability
EA.hy926 cells with almost 100% confluence 
were treated by IL-8 with different concentrations (0
ng/mL as controls, 50, 100 and 200 ng/mL) and du￾rations (100 ng/ml IL-8 treated for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h), 
respectively. At each time point, the cells were 
washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraform￾aldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were 
incubated in the BODIPY FL Phallotoxins solution 
(with 1:100 dilution, InvitrogenTM, USA) for 90 min, 
the DAPI (4’, 6’- diamidino-2-phenylindole) with 
1:800 dilution was added for nuclei staining for 30 
min. Each step was followed by washing with PBS for 
5 min for less three times. Using a laser scanning 
confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5, Germany), the 
morphologies and gaps among all groups indicated 
endothelial permeability were examined. For trans￾mission electron microscope (TEM) observation, 
samples were treated by IL-8 and gently collected by a 
plastic cell scrapper (Corning, USA) to maintain
origin cell-cell junction. The samples were centrifuged 
at 1,500 rpm for 10 min, fixed with 0.5% glutaralde￾hyde, and stored at 4°C for 10 min. Then, the samples 
were centrifuged again at 12,000 rpm for 10 min; the
supernatant was discarded and 3% glutaraldehyde 
was added slowly. All samples were fixed by 1% 
OsO4, dehydrated by different concentration of ace￾tone, embedded by epoxy resin (Epon812), cut into 
slices and doubled dyed by uranyl acetate and lead 
citrate. The micro-structure of cell-cell junctions were 
observed by TEM (H-600IV, Japan).
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reac￾tion (RT-PCR) 
The mRNA expressions of occludin, claudin-5 
and ZO-1 were semi- quantitatively determined by
RT-PCR assays. Total RNA was extracted from the 
cells by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Com￾pany, USA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by 
using the Revert Aid™ Frist Strand cDNA Synthesis 
System (Fermentas). RT-PCR was carried out by using 
the TaKaRa One Step RNA PCR Kit (AMV) (TaKaRa, 
Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s in￾structions. To obtain the relative quantitative values 
for gene expression, β-actin was used as the endoge￾nous control. Sequences of the primers used for 
RT-PCR listed in Table 1 were designed by Invitrogen 
Company (USA). The reaction conditions were as 
follows: incubation at 95°C for 3min, denaturation at 
95°C for 30 s, annealing at 53°C (occludin), 56°C 
(claudin-5), 52°C (ZO-1) or 55°C (β-actin) for 30s, and 
polymerization at 72°C for 60s for 22 cycles, followed 
by a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR 
products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% 
agarose gel in 1×Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer after 
staining with 0.5 μg·ml-1 ethidium bromide. All elec￾trophoresis images were quantitatively analyzed by 
using Gel-Pro Analyzer 4.5 software and normalized 
to their respective β-actin values.

Western blotting assay
EA.hy926 cells were washed twice with PBS on 
the ice, then treated with 200 μl RIPA buffer, con￾taining 1% Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) 
and CompleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche 
Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis). 30 min later, 
the lysed cells were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5
min, and the supernatant was collected. Total protein 
content of the lysates was determined using a BCA
(bicinchoninic acid) Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime In￾stitute of Biotechnology, China). Proteins in the ly￾sates were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis 
and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes 
were blocked in 1% BSA at room temperature for less 
2 h, and then incubated with the diluted primary an￾tibody in TBST buffer at 4°C for overnight. After in￾cubation, membranes were washed three times for 5
min at room temperature with TBST buffer and in￾cubated with the appropriate peroxidase￾conjugated secondary antibody (in TBST, 1:8000) for 1
h. Membranes were then rinsed three times for 5 min 
with TBST buffer. Target proteins were detected using 
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Images of bands 
were determined using Molecular Image® Chemi￾DocTM XRS+ with Image LabTM Software (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Inc., USA.)
Immunofluorescence staining
EA.hy 926 cells were plated on small circular 
slides respectively with 50% confluent and serum 
starved overnight, and then treated with IL-8 for 
various concentrations (50, 100 and 200 ng/ml) and 
durations (2, 4, 6 and 8h), respectively. Then cells 
were washed twice each with PBS for 5 min, fixed 
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 8 min, washed 
three times each with PBS for 5 min. Cells were 
pre-incubated with 1% BSA in PBS for 15 min to de￾crease non-specific antibody binding and washed for 
30s to 1 min with PBS. Primary antibodies incubation 
(Occludin and ZO-1, E-cadherin and N-cadherin) was 
performed at 4°C overnight and slides were washed 
for 5 min with PBS for 3 times, and further incubated 
for 90 min in FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse anti￾body and PE-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, 
and then incubated with DAPI (4’
6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole) that stained nuclei for 
30 min at 37°C. Samples were sealed by 10% glycerol, 
kept from light and observed by laser scanning con￾focal microscope (Leica TCS SP5, Germany).
Statistical analysis
All experiments repeated 3 times at least (n=3).
Means, together with standard deviations, were cal￾culated for the experimental and control groups. 
One-Way ANOVA with Duncan’s new multiple range 
method was performed by using data analysis soft￾ware of SPSS12.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). The 
results were expressed as means ± S.D. The P values 
were calculated to test the level of statistical signifi￾cance. The differences were considered significant at 
P < 0.05.
Results
IL-8 induced changes of endothelial permea￾bility in dose- and time-dependent manners
The tightness degree of the tight junctions was 
evaluated by Transwell assay. Endothelial monolayer 
were cultured in Matrigel-coated transwells and 
treated with IL-8. FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin
was penetrated due to increased endothelial permea￾bility induced by IL-8. The fluorescence intensity was 
quantified and permeability coefficient (Pa) was cal￾culated according to the formula in previous section, 
and the results were showed in Fig.1. It could be seen 
that the permeability coefficient, Pa, was gradually 
increased with the concentration (from 0 to 200 
ng/ml, Fig.1A) and duration (from 0 to 8h, Fig.1B) of
IL-8. Under the concentration of 100 ng/ml and 200 
ng/ml IL-8 stimulated for 4h, the Pa was higher than 
that under 0 (as controls) and 50 ng/ml (P< 0.05). As 
to different treated duration, the Pa under 100 ng/ml 
IL-8 stimulated for 4, 6, 8 h was higher than that under

stimulated for 0 h (controls) and 2 h (P<0.05), respec￾tively. These results confirmed the change of endo￾thelium permeability stimulated by IL-8 exhibited
dose and time-dependent manners. 
The morphological cell-cell junction changes of 
endothelium stimulated by IL-8
The morphologic changes of endothelial per￾meability with different concentrations of IL-8 were 
observed by laser confocal microscopy. After the IL-8
concentration increased from 50 to 200 ng/ml, gaps 
were observed between adjacent endothelial cells, 
correlating increased endothelial permeability with 
gap formation (white arrows indicated in Fig.2). We 
further checked the gap at cell-cell junctions by TEM 
observation, and the elevated distance could be 
clearly found with increase of concentration and 
treated duration of IL-8 among single cells (black ar￾rows indicated in Fig.3). Based on the physical and 
morphological results, both dose and time-dependent 
manners were concluded in IL-8 induced endothelial 
permeability.
IL-8-induced permeability is dependent upon 
down-regulation of mRNA and proteins of 
tight junction
We supposed that IL-8-induced permeability 
was dependent upon regulation of tight junction
proteins. Three classes of proteins are known to lo￾calize to tight junctions, including claudins, occludin 
and junction adhesion molecules. The claudin ex￾pression is highly restricted to specific regions of dif￾ferent tissues and may have an important role in 
transcellular transport through tight junctions. Oc￾cludin is an integral membrane protein closely asso￾ciated with the tight junctions of endothelial cells. 
Therefore, the mRNA and proteins expression of oc￾cludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 were investigated.
To determine the effect of IL-8 with different 
concentrations and treated durations on mRNA and 
proteins expression of specific tight junction compo￾nents, cells were exposed to 50, 100, 200 ng/ml IL-8 
for 2h, and 100 ng/ml IL-8 for 2, 4, 6 8h, respectively. 
The mRNA and proteins expression level of occludin, 
claudin-5 and ZO-1 were further examined by 
RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis, respectively. 
Fig.4A showed the effect of IL-8 with various treated 
durations (from 2h to 8h) and concentrations (from 50 
to 200 ng/ml) on mRNA expression of occludin, 
claudin-5 and ZO-1. According to the PCR bands in 
Fig.4A, it could be found the endothelial cells treated 
with increased concentration of IL-8 down-regulated 
the mRNA expression of occludin, claudin-5 and 
ZO-1, and the increased treated duration of IL-8 also 
showed significant decrease mRNA expression of 
these proteins (Fig.4B, C and D).
Fig.1 The changes of endothelial permeability induced by IL-8 exhibited dose- and time-dependent manners. Permeability assay was perform as 
depicted in 2.1, and coefficient (Pa) in groups was calculated by formula Pa = [Ca]/t ×1/S ×V/[Cl]. (A) The transwell cultured with endothelium were treated with 50, 
100 and 200 ng/ml IL-8, respectively. (B) The transwell cultured with endothelium were treated with 200 ng/ml IL-8 for 2, 4, 6 and 8h, respectively. Values rep￾resented the mean±S.E (n=3). *, P<0.05 denoted statistically significant difference compares to control.
Fig.2 Cultured cells treated with 0 (as controls), 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml IL-8 for 4h were stained with F-actin, and examined by laser confocal microscopy. The white 
arrows in figures showed visible cell-cell gaps formation. Scale bar in all images = 25 μm.

level of β-actin in each group was used as intrinsic controls, and relative expression mRNA of occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 were calculated, respectively. Values

The expression levels of Occludin, Claudin-5 and 
ZO-1 proteins were further determined by Western 
blotting, and the results were showed in Fig.5. Similar 
to the results of mRNA expression, the expression 
level of Occludin, Claudin-5 and ZO-1 proteins de￾creased with higher concentration and longer dura￾tion of IL-8, and showed a dose- and time-dependence
(Fig.5A). With increased treated concentration to 
100-200 ng/ml, the expression level of Occludin, 
Claudin-5 and ZO-1 proteins are weaker than that of 
control (Fig.5 B, C&D). As to treated duration, 100 
ng/ml IL-8 significantly decreased Occludin after 4h 
(P<0.05, Fig. 5E), and IL-8 reduced Claudin-5 expres￾sion at 4, 6, 8h showed a significant difference com￾pare to control (0h) and 2h (P<0.05, Fig. 5F); only ZO-1 
expression level showed a significant difference 
compare to control from initial 2h (Fig.5G). Further￾more, the distribution of Occludin and ZO-1 in dif￾ferent concentration of IL-8 treatment was examined 
by double immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5H). 
The expression levels of Occludin and ZO-1 were 
consistent with the results of Western blot. It could be 
found that the Occludin (green) and ZO-1 (red) local￾ized at the cell border in control group, and IL-8 sig￾nificantly decreases tight junction contents. Under 
IL-8 treatment, a loss of Occludin and ZO-1 was 
found, showing that the effect of IL-8 on Occludin was 
more pronounced. The ZO-1 showed the decreased 
level but still distributed at the edge of cells (200 
ng/ml group in Fig. 5H), while a diffuse cytoplasmic 
distribution of Occludin was gradually observed in 
cells with increased concentration of IL-8. These re￾sults confirmed that IL-8 induced permeability is de￾pendent upon down-regulation of mRNA and pro￾teins of tight junctions.

IL-8 down-regulated E-Cadherin but not 
N-Cadherin
The cadherin, major members of 
Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules that form ad￾herent junctions and function to mediate cell-cell 
binding critical to the maintenance of tissue structure.
E-cadherin (E-Cad) and N-cadherin (N-Cad) share 
many structural and functional features, which estab￾lish Ca2+-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion 
with their extracellular domains and connect with 
catenin at their intracellular domains [21]. In this 
study, the effect of increased IL-8 concentration on 
expression and distribution of E-Cad and N-Cad was 
examined by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig.6, 
increased dose of IL-8 could markedly reduce the ex￾pression of E-Cad, but did not affect N-Cad expres￾sion. There are no obvious changes of localization 
could be found. The result suggested that potential 
effect of IL-8 mediating endothelial permeability by 
down-regulation of adherent junction.
IL-8-induced permeability was not dependent 
upon integrins-FAs pathway
Integrin, which is a family of extracellular matrix 
receptors, transduces signaling from the outside ECM 
to the inside cell and regulate many aspects of cell 
behavior. Integrins are bound to ECM at specific cel￾lular sites, named “focal contacts” or “focal adhe￾sions” that are responsible for the adhesive interac￾tions of the endothelial cell monolayer with ECM. The 
integrin α2β1, α5β1 and αvβ3, the primary receptors 
of VN, FN, LN and Col, are widespread in many cells. 
The integrins mediate dynamic interactions between 
the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton. In 
this study, the effect of IL-8 on the expression of in￾tegrins subunits α2, α5, β1 and β3 were respectively 
examined, and the results were showed in Fig.7. It 
could be seen from Fig.7, there was no significant 
difference of integrin subunits (α2, α5, β1 and β3) ex￾pression level among all samples under increased 
concentration (P>0.05, Fig.7 B, C, D & E) and treated 
duration (P>0.05, Fig.7 F, G, H & I) of IL-8.
We further investigated the actin cytoskeleton by 
integrin cytoplasmic tail β binding proteins (Talin, 
Vinculin and Paxillin), which formed focal adhesions 
(FAs) cytoplasmic plaque implicated in regulation of 
the actin cytoskeleton (Fig.8). The phosphorylation of 
Paxillin upon integrin engagement or growth factor 
stimulation can create binding sites for the adapter 
protein and localize to focal adhesion. It could be 
found that the expression level of FA components 
exhibited less difference (P>0.05) with incremental 
concentration (Fig.8 B, C&D) and treated duration 
(Fig.8 E, F, &G) of IL-8. The ratio of phosphorylated 
Paxillin (pPax) in total Paxillin also showed less dif￾ference with various concentrations and durations of

IL-8 treatment (Fig.8 H&I). These results suggested 
that the increased endothelial permeability induced 
by IL-8, was not dependent upon integrins-FAs 
pathway, and that IL-8 could not regulate the ECM 
and its interactions with the endothelium.

Discussion
The vascular endothelial cell monolayer is local￾ized at the critical interface between the blood and 
vessel wall, which has the vital functions of regulating 
balance and supplying the essential nutrients needed 
for the survival of the organism. The endothelium, 
which is composed of vascular endothelial cells, plays 
a central role in maintaining the vascular homeostasis 
by releasing endothelium-derived relaxing factor in￾cluding prostacyclin (PGI2), nitric oxide (NO), and 
endothelium-derived contracting factor including 
platelet-activating factor (PAF) and endothelin-1 
(ET-1) [22]. The semi-permeable barrier of cell-cell

junction could maintain exchange of macromolecules 
between the blood and tissue through interstitial 
space, which could be regulated by a lot of mediators 
such as thrombin, TNF-α, LPS, and chemokines [23].
IL-8 is one of chemokines produced by macrophages 
and some epithelial cells. The primary biological ef￾fects of IL-8 are to recruit neutrophils to phagocytose 
the antigen, which triggers the antigen pattern 
toll-like receptors. Elevated levels of IL-8 have been 
found at site of injured endothelium and atheroscle￾rotic plaque [24]. In our previous studies, it was found 
that IL-8 could induce the expression changes of Rac1 
and RhoA in a time-dependent way, mediate cyto￾skeletal rearrangement and regulate the ECs migra￾tion through the activation of phosphoinositide 
3-kinase (PI3K)-Rac1/RhoA pathway [25], and that 
laminar shear stress could increase the mRNA level of 
IL-8 in a CXC chemokine receptors 
(CXCR1/CXCR2)-dependent way [26]. Jovanovic et al 
[16] proved that IL-8 could regulate trophoblast cell 
(HTR-8/SVneo) migration in a dose-dependent way 
(from 0.5 to 5 ng/ml, but decreased with 10 ng/ml 
IL-8 addition) and increase expression levels of Integ￾rins α5 and β1 subunits. Lee et al [27] found that 
knockdown of IL-8 could inhibit the migratory ability 
and decrease integrins αV and β3 expression in hu￾man chondrosarcoma cells lines (JJ012 and SW1353). 
In addition, it has been reported that Integrins (e.g. 
αV, α3, α4, β1, β5) participated in change of vascular 
permeability and endothelial barrier function by some 
drugs and growth factors such as cilengitide [28], 
pseudomonas aeruginosa [29], and VEGF [30-31]. 
However, in this study, our results showed that the 
expression levels of Integrins α2, α5, β1 and β3 were 
not changed with the concentration and duration of 
IL-8 addition, suggesting that the endothelial perme￾ability regulated by IL-8 did not depend on integ￾rins-induced signals. The possible reason is that dif￾ferent cell types result in inconsistent conclusions. In 
addition, recent studies showed that IL-8 signals 
played an essential role of acquisition and/or 
maintenance of the mesenchymal and invasive fea￾tures in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
of human carcinoma cells [32], and down-regulation 
of tight junction is associated with EMT in cancer cells 
[33].
Emerging findings indicate that IL-8 promotes 
endothelial permeability by initiating the activation of 
CXCR2 [34], which could stimulate VEGFR phos￾phorylation in a transactivation manner [19]. CXCR2 
or VEGFR enhanced endothelial permeability via 
PI3K/Akt, Rho/Rock activation, actin polymerization 
and phosphorylations of VE-cadherin and Occludin, 
resulting in opening of adherent junctions and tight 
junctions [35]. The activation of the PI3K/Akt path￾way that inhibits GSK-3β blocking β-catenin and snail 
involved in EMT, and represses the expression of 
E-cadherin and tight junction [36]. IL-8 stimulates 
PI3K through its G protein-linked receptor, CXCR2, 
providing a specific molecular targeted intervention 
in vascular permeability [37]. The growth factor, 
VEGF has also been found that it induced Occludin 
degradation and regulated its phosphorylation and 
ubiquitination, but showed no effect on expression of 
claudin-5 [10]. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is also an interleu￾kin that acts as both a pro-inflammatory and an￾ti-inflammatory cytokine. Suzuki et al demonstrated 
IL-6 could increase Claudin-2 expression and regulate 
tight junction permeability in intestinal epithelium 
[11]. Tai et al found that amyloid-β could 
down-regulate Occludin and increase permeability in 
human brain endothelial cells via MAPK signaling 
pathway, which is associated in vascular dysfunction 
of blood–brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease [38]. 
Nag S. et al also demonstrated that blood-brain barri￾er breakdown showed a marked increase of caveo￾lin-1, loss of Occludin and reduced localization of 
Claudin-5, and increased expression of caveolin-1 
preceded the decreased expression of Occludin and 
Claudin-5 in tight junction [39]. In addition, both 
IL-1β and TNF-α increased permeability in bovine 
retinal endothelial cells (BREC), and TNF-α signals 
significantly decreased the protein and mRNA of the 
tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Claudin-5, and al￾tered the cellular localization of these tight junction 
proteins through PKCξ/NF-κB pathway [9], while 
IL-1β could increase intestinal epithelial tight junction 
permeability by an NF-κB-dependent increase in 
myosin L chain kinase (MLCK) gene transcription 
[40], which is mediated by MEK kinase (MEKK-1) in a 
canonical NF-κB pathway and NFκB inducing kinase 
(NIK) in an activation of the noncanonical NF-κB 
pathway [41]. 
The permeability of the vascular barrier can be 
modified in response to specific stimuli acting on en￾dothelial cells. As significant structural foundation of 
endothelial permeability, cell junctions consist of 
multi-protein complexes that provide contact between 
neighboring cells or between a cell and the extracel￾lular matrix. There are three major types of cell junc￾tions: adherent junctions, desmosomes and hemi￾desmosomes (anchoring junctions), gap junctions 
(communicating junction) and tight junctions (oc￾cludin junctions) [7]. Tight junctions are the closely 
associated areas of two cells whose membranes join 
together forming a virtually impermeable barrier to 
fluid, which consist of some different peripheral 
membrane proteins located on the intracellular side of 
plasma membrane and regulate the passage of ions 
and molecules through the paracellular pathway in

epithelial and endothelial cells. The major types are 
Claudins and Occludins, which could anchor the 
strands to the actin component of the cytoskeleton, 
was used in this study to investigate enhancement of 
paracellular permeability and damage of tight junc￾tion with IL-8 introduction. In present study, the un￾derlying mechanisms the effects of IL-8 on endothelial 
permeability were studied, and the results demon￾strated that IL-8 down-regulated tight junction pro￾teins expression, which was associated with an in￾crease in endothelial permeability. Occludin, Clau￾din-5 and ZO-1 are widely studied, which contribute 
to alterations in endothelial permeability in response 
to inflammatory cytokines. However, the expression 
level and cellular location of Occludin, Claudin-5 and 
ZO-1 coupled with increase of endothelial permeabil￾ity are different in various cell lines. Nag S. et al 
demonstrated that blood-brain barrier breakdown 
showed a marked loss of Occludin and reduce of lo￾calization of Claudin-5 [39]. Aveleira et al indicated 
that TNF-α increased permeability with a decrease of 
the protein and mRNA of ZO-1 and Claudin-5, but 
increased level of Occludin [9]. While Noth et al 
observed a down-regulation of Occludin without any 
changes in ZO-1 with an increased paracellular 
permeability in a murine model of acute graft versus 
host disease of the small intestine [42]. Tai et al found 
that amyloid-β could down-regulate Occludin with 
increased permeability in human brain endothelial 
cells [38]. However, we found in this study that IL-8 
could down-regulate the levels of Occludin, Claudin-5 
and ZO-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, 
which contributed to increase of endothelial permea￾bility. The reason for difference of Occludin, Clau￾din-5 and ZO-1 expression may be related to 
differences in cell types and conditions of cell culture.
Integrin cytoplasmic tail β binding FAs provides 
an important structural basis for anchoring the endo￾thelial lining to its surrounding matrices in the vas￾cular wall. The assembly of FAs serves as important 
signaling events in modulating endothelial permea￾bility under stimulatory conditions including angio￾genic factors, inflammatory mediators, or physical 
forces [43]. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a 
non-receptor tyrosine kinase functions as the en￾gagement of integrins and assembly of FAs through 
the catalyzing of several downstream signals and 
mediates cell behaviors [44]. Integrin- and growth 
factor-stimulated cues are significant events for 
activating FAK [45]. It has been found that the endo￾thelial permeability could be regulated by various 
factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)
[46] and VEGF [47] invovled associated FAK signals. 
The G protein subunits downstream of protease acti￾vated receptor 1 (PAR1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate 
receptor 1 (S1P1) could initiate phosphorylation of 
FAK and regulate endothelial barrier function [48]. 
Activated FAK stimulated by S1P, participates in re￾arrangement of actin cytoskeletal at the cell periphery, 
strengthens cell-matrix (FA) and cell-cell (adherens 
junction) junctional complex, and decreases vascular 
permeability [49]. In addition, previous reports also 
demonstrated that IL-8 could induce phosphorylation 
of FAK via IL-8 receptors CXCR1/CXCR2, and medi￾ate cell migration [50]. Therefore, FAs components 
including Talin, Paxillin and Vinculin as FAK-binding 
partners were investigated in this study, and our re￾sults indicated that there were no significant differ￾ences among their expression level under IL-8 stimu￾lation with different concentration and duration, 
suggesting that IL-8 regulating endothelial permea￾bility was not dependent upon alteration of 
cell–matrix adhesions.
Conclusion
In this study, the endothelial permeability in￾duced by IL-8 and the mRNA and protein expression 
level of tight junction components (ZO-1, Claudin-5 
and Occludin) were examined. We found that IL-8 
regulated the permeability of endothelium by 
down-regulation of tight junction in a dose- and 
time-dependence manner. However, the expression 
levels of Integrins and focal adhesion components 
showed no significant difference with increased con￾centration and duration of IL-8 treatment, suggesting 
that IL-8 induced endothelial permeability may not be 
dependent upon adhesion behavior of cell-substrate. 
This finding reveals the molecular mechanism in the 
increase of endothelial cell permeability induced by
IL-8, and it may lead to the development of new 
therapies that can be applied in pathological condi￾tions involving increase in endothelial permeability.
