INTRODUCTION 
As liver fibrosis is closely related to the prognosis of patients 
with chronic liver diseases (CLD), assessment of the extent and 
progression of liver fibrosis is important in deciding treatment 
strategies for patients with CLD.1,2 Although liver biopsy (LB) has 
been considered as the golden standard for evaluation of liver 
fibrosis to date, several issues such as sampling errors, intra- and 
inter-observer variability, and potential life-threatening complica￾tions have prevented wide use of LB in clinical practice.3,4 More￾over, serial LB examinations to monitor the dynamic changes in 
liver fibrosis or disease progression is impossible because of the 
inherent invasiveness. Therefore, the need for a non-invasive 
method of liver fibrosis assessment has increased and various 
surrogate models using blood or clinical parameters have been 
proposed.5
Recently, liver stiffness measurement using transient elastogra￾phy (TE; FibroScan®
, EchoSens, Paris, France), which is an ultra￾sound-based modality for quantitative assessment of liver fibrosis, 
has been introduced and had gained increasing attention globally. 
First reported in 2003, its clinical usefulness has been investigated 
in a large number of studies.6-13 Most studies have demonstrated 
diagnostic accuracy of TE for assessing liver fibrosis in various eti￾ology of CLDs cross-sectionally.14-16 Recently, an additional role of

Chronic liver disease represents a major public health problem, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. As prognosis and management depend mainly on the amount and progression of liver fibrosis, accurate 
quantification of liver fibrosis is essential for therapeutic decision-making and follow-up of chronic liver diseases. Even 
though liver biopsy is the gold standard for evaluation of liver fibrosis, non-invasive methods that could substitute for 
invasive procedures have been investigated during past decades. Transient elastography (TE, FibroScan®) is a novel 
non-invasive method for assessment of liver fibrosis with chronic liver disease. TE can be performed in the outpatient 
clinic with immediate results and excellent reproducibility. Its diagnostic accuracy for assessment of liver fibrosis has 
been demonstrated in patients with chronic viral hepatitis; as a result, unnecessary liver biopsy could be avoided in 
some patients. Moreover, due to its excellent patient acceptance, TE could be used for monitoring disease progression 
or predicting development of liver-related complications. This review aims at discussing the usefulness of TE in clinical 
practice. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2012;18:163-173)

TE, monitoring disease progression has begun to attract attention, 
which indicates that the role of TE is not merely limited in lessen￾ing unnecessary LB, but TE can enable establishment of tailored 
management strategies by providing more detailed prognostic 
information.17
Here, we review currently available data regarding the role of 
TE in liver fibrosis assessment and prognosis prediction.
TRANSIENT ELASTOGRAPHY
The basic principle of TE is that the propagation velocity of a 
wave through a homogenous tissue is proportional to its elastic￾ity, which is correlated with the amount of fibrosis in the liver.18
Briefly, TE consists of an ultrasound transducer mounted on the 
axis of the vibrator, which produces vibration of a mild amplitude 
and low frequency (50 Hz), consequently inducing an elastic shear 
wave that propagates through the liver. Pulse-echo ultrasound 
follows the propagation of the shear wave and measures its veloc￾ity, which is related to liver tissue stiffness. It is reported that the 
velocity of elastic waves is faster in fibrotic liver than normal livers 
in previous study.6
Performance of TE takes only a few minutes, and it is well toler￾ated by most patients. TE is performed on the right lobe of the 
liver, through intercostal spaces, with the patient lying in dorsal 
decubitus with the right arm in maximal abduction. The opera￾tor, assisted by time motion ultrasound images, locates the probe 
in a liver portion at least 6 cm thick and free of large vascular 
structures and gallbladders and presses the probe button to com￾mence the measurement. Usually, 10 valid measurements should 
be performed to examine a patient with TE. The median value of 
the ten valid measurements is considered representative of liver 
elasticity. The success rate is calculated as the number of valid 
measurements divided by the total number of measurements. 
Examinations with a success rate higher than 60% are considered 
reliable. The results are immediately obtained after performance 
of TE and expressed in kilopascals (kPa), corresponding to the me￾dian value of 10 validated measurements (range 2.5-75 kPa). The 
interquartile range (IQR), which represents the intrinsic variability 
of TE, <30% of the median indicates a high-quality result. 
However, in a recent study, the IQR/median value (IQR/M) was 
recently proposed as a factor that determines the accuracy of TE 
irrespective of the success rate, in patients with chronic hepatitis 
C (CHC).19 In contrast, regarding patients with chronic hepatitis B 
(CHB), advanced liver fibrosis stage on LB (F3-4) was significantly 
associated with non-discordance with LB data, regardless of IQR/
M and success rate.20 Thus, further studies are necessary to re￾solve this controversial issue.
NORMAL TE VALUES
Besides assessment of liver fibrosis, it is also important to 
confirm whether TE can reliably identify patients with CLD in the 
normal population. Nevertheless, only few studies have been 
available. Roulot et al examined a large cohort of 429 apparently 
healthy French subjects to establish normal TE values (5.81±1.54 
[range, 3.8-8.0] kPa in men vs. 5.23±1.59 [range, 3.3-7.8] kPa in 
women, P<0.01).21 Normal TE values for Asian subjects have been 
also reported. Fung et al reported a mean TE value in 28 healthy 
living-related liver donors of 4.6 (range, 2.0-7.1) kPa, and all sub￾jects had TE values of <7.2 kPa, which indicated that they had no 
significant fibrosis.22 Our group has also reported that the normal 
range of TE values is 3.9-5.3 kPa, which was calculated from 69 
strictly selected living liver and kidney donors.23 All these data 
demonstrated that TE can reliably identify high-risk subpopula￾tions without overlap between the normal and abnormal ranges 
of TE values and indicated that the use of TE can be extended as a 
screening tool.24
However, it is also noticeable that the mean LS values in Asian 
studies seem to be slightly lower than those in European studies; 
furthermore, the influence of gender and metabolic syndrome on 
TE value remains controversial.25 Thus, further large-scale confir￾mative studies are still required.
DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF ASSESSING 
LIVER FIBROSIS
Most studies on TE have focused on its ability to identify sig￾nificant fibrosis and cirrhosis, because the presence of significant 
fibrosis is an indication for antiviral treatment and the presence of 
cirrhosis is cornerstone for initiating surveillance program for the 
early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. 
As the current gold standard for liver fibrosis assessment, LB is 
the reference for calculation of the diagnostic accuracy of TE. The 
accuracy of TE has been estimated by calculating areas under the 
receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for prediction 
of each fibrosis stage based on LB and comparing these with the 
AUROC values of other non-invasive models.

Hepatitis C
A considerable number of studies from Western nations have 
demonstrated that TE values are significantly correlated with his￾tological fibrosis stage and have high diagnostic accuracy superior 
or similar to other non-invasive methods such as FibroTest in pa￾tients with CHC (Table 1).7,8,26-29 In these studies, the AUROC of TE 
ranged from 0.77 to 0.90, with a cutoff value of 6.2-8.7 kPa for 
assessment of significant fibrosis (F≥2), and an AUROC of 0.90-
0.97 and cutoff value of 9.6-14.8 kPa for assessment of cirrhosis 
(Table 1). In South Korea, one multi-center cohort study reported 
the diagnostic performance of TE in populations with CHC (Table 
1).29 In this study, the optimal cutoff value for significant fibrosis 
was 6.2 kPa and that for cirrhosis was 11.0 kPa, which were more 
accurate than other non-invasive parameters such as aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI).29
Hepatitis B
Marcellin et al first reported the diagnostic accuracy of TE in 
populations with CHB.14 In this study, the AUROC was 0.81 for sig￾nificant fibrosis and 0.93 for cirrhosis. Several other studies have 
also reported the diagnostic accuracy of TE in patients with CHB 
(Table 1).14-16,30-33 The performance and corresponding cutoff TE 
values for predicting significant fibrosis (AUROC, 0.81-0.95; cutoff 
value, 6.3-7.9 kPa)31-33 and cirrhosis (AUROC, 0.80 to 0.98; cutoff 
value, 9-13.8 kPa) are shown in Table 1.14-16,30-33 Currently, TE is 
considered to have an acceptable diagnostic accuracy in patients 
with CHB,34 although the overall AUROCs seem slightly lower than 
those reported from populations with CHC (Table 1).
In general, the cutoff values for cirrhosis in patients with CHB 
tend to be lower than those for CHC. This phenomenon can be 
explained by the fact that the amount of liver fibrosis is lower be￾cause hepatitis B virus tends to generate macronodular cirrhosis. 
In addition, the physician should also keep in mind the overesti￾mating influence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flare, which is 
frequent in CHB.35 Thus, TE values in populations with CHB should 
be interpreted cautiously due to the simultaneous possibility of 
false negatives (low fibrotic extent) and false positives (high ALT). 
To overcome the confounding effect of high ALT, several studies 
have suggested varying cutoff values according to ALT levels in 
patients with CHB.32,16
Other etiologies
Other studies have reported the accuracy of TE in patients 
with CLD related to etiologies other than CHB and CHC.36-46 First, 
the role of TE was investigated in patients with hepatitis C and 
HIV co-infection.36,40-42 In these studies, the AUROC of TE for 
significant fibrosis ranged from 0.72 to 0.87, with cutoff values 
of 4.5-9.3 kPa, and the AUROC for cirrhosis from 0.87 to 0.99, 
with cutoff values of 11.8-14.0 kPa, which are similar to those in

patients with CHC only. Additionally, recent studies have investi￾gated the usefulness of TE in patients with non-viral liver disease 
such as primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or 
Wilson’s disease.37,38,43,44. Although the diagnostic accuracy was 
considerable (AUROC, range 0.81-0.95 for significant fibrosis and 
0.91-0.96 for cirrhosis), its usefulness requires further validation. 
Interestingly, recent studies have suggested the ability of TE to as￾sess fibrosis stage in patients taking methotrexate with potential 
hepatotoxicity due to rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel 
disease, or psoriasis.39,45,46
Meta-analysis
Four meta-analyses have assessed the diagnostic performance 
of TE.47-50 In the most large-scaled study including 50 studies, the 
mean AUROCs for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrho￾sis were 0.84 and 0.94, respectively, with optimal cutoff values 
of 7.6 and 13.01 kPa, respectively.48 Although previous meta￾analyses suggested that TE is a reliable method for assessment of 
liver fibrosis stage irrespective of etiology, it should be noted that 
most studies included in the meta-analysis was based on Western 
populations with CHC. Consequently, it would be unwise to apply 
these cutoff values from previous meta-analysis to patients with 
diverse CLD etiologies. 
Combination with other fibrosis prediction 
models
To increase the accuracy of liver fibrosis assessment, new ap￾proaches using a combination of TE and other fibrosis prediction 
models have been proposed in several studies.51-56 A recent study 
by Castera et al suggested that the number of LB for assessment 
of significant fibrosis could be significantly reduced through the 
use of combinations of TE and FibroTest in populations with CHC.51
Similarly, our group also demonstrated that the performance of TE 
can be enhanced when combined with other fibrosis prediction 
models such as FibroTest in patients with CHB.54-56 However, the 
cost-effectiveness of combining other non-invasive models with TE 
needs to be clarified in the future.
CHANGES IN TE VALUES DURING ANTIVIRAL 
TREATMENT 
Due to the ease, safety, and rapidity of performing, it can 
be assumed that TE can be used for monitoring of the dynamic 
changes of liver fibrosis during anti-viral or anti-fibrotic treatment. 
Indeed, several studies have reported the clinical usefulness of TE 
for monitoring of the potential fibrosis regression during antiviral 
treatment in patients with CHC and CHB.33,57,58
Hepatitis C
The clinical implications of changes in TE values during antiviral 
treatment for patients with CHC have been investigated in several 
studies. Two prospective studies by Vergniol et al57 and Ogawa 
et al58 demonstrated that patients with CHC showing sustained 
virological responses to pegylated interferon-ribavirin combination 
therapy had significantly reduced TE values at the end of follow￾up. Moreover, Ogawa et al reported that patients with non￾sustained virological responses but with a biochemical response 
showed a greater reduction in TE values than did those with a 
non-biochemical response.58 Subsequent studies reported simi￾lar results, suggesting that changes in TE values during antiviral 
treatment in patients with CHC may represent alterations in liver 
fibrosis severity.59,60 However, it was not clearly indicated in these 
studies whether the reduction in TE values was closely correlated 
with regression of liver fibrosis based on paired biopsy and with 
favorable long-term clinical outcomes.
Hepatitis B
Dynamic changes in TE values during antiviral treatment in 
patients with CHB have been mostly reported in Asian coun￾tries.30,61-63 In a large prospective cohort study of 426 patients, 
Fung et al reported that a significant decline in TE value occurred 
in patients with CHB after 3 years of antiviral treatment using oral 
agents.61 However, the significant reduction in TE values at follow￾up compared with baseline (6.1 kPa vs. 7.8 kPa respectively) was 
limited in patients who had elevated ALT levels at baseline and 
subsequent normalization after 3 years. As liver histology was not 
available in this study, it was not certain that decline in TE values 
reflected liver fibrosis regression or ALT stabilization of by antiviral 
treatment. To exclude the confounding effect of high ALT, our 
group investigated changes in TE values during antiviral treatment 
in 41 patients with CHB showing low ALT levels (≤2× upper limit 
of normal).30 After 1-2 years of antiviral treatment, TE values sig￾nificantly decreased compared with baseline, whereas ALT levels 
were unchanged (Fig. 1). Interestingly, 3 patients with reduced TE 
values experienced concomitant fibrosis regression on follow-up

biopsy, suggesting the potential fibrosis regression by long-term 
antiviral treatment can be monitored using TE.
However, whether changes in TE values indicate fibrosis regres￾sion remains controversial, because a recent study by Lim et al, 
which compared serial TE values and paired LB in 15 patients with 
CHB undergoing antiviral treatment, reported that the reduction in 
TE values was correlated with improved necroinflammatory scores, 
not with fibrosis regression.62
PREDICTION OF HEPATIC DECOMPENSATION
Foucher et al64 reported that the cutoff value of 27.5, 37.5, 
49.1, 53.7, and 62.7 kPa had >90% negative predictive values for 
the presence of large esophageal varices (stage 2/3), Child-Pugh 
score B or C, past history of ascites, HCC, and esophageal bleed￾ing, respectively. Subsequently, correlations between TE values 
and hepatic decompensation due to increased portal hypertension 
have been investigated in several studies.
A significant correlation between TE values and portal hyper￾tension, expressed as the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), 
was demonstrated by Vizzutti et al,65 suggesting that TE may re￾flect a progressive rise in portal pressure mainly due to increased 
hepatic vascular resistance caused by fibrillar extracellular matrix 
accumulation. As variceal bleeding is the most important compli￾cation of portal hypertension, the relationship between TE values 
and the presence of esophageal varices has been also investigated 
Figure 2. Cumulative incidence rates of EV bleeding based on LSPS values. The incidence of variceal bleeding increased significantly in 
association with higher LSPS value (long-rank test, P<0.001; A) Among patients with high-risk EV, the incidence rate of variceal bleeding was 
significantly higher in patient with LSPS ≥6.5 (subgroup 2; B) than those with LSPS <6.5 (subgroup 1; B). EV, esophageal varice; LSPS, liver stiffness￾spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (adapted from reference 70).

in several studies.66-68 All of these studies demonstrated that there 
is a significant correlations between TE values and the presence of 
esophageal varices and that TE values could predict the presence 
of large varices (more than grade 2).66,67 Although TE can predict 
the presence of esophageal varices and consequently assist in 
selection of candidates for endoscopic screening or prophylactic 
treatment, several issues still remain unresolved. First, the cutoff 
values (range, 13.9-21.5 kPa) and performance of TE were varied 
among the studies (AUROC range, 0.76-0.85).66-68 Second, TE 
alone seems insufficient to predict the presence of esophageal 
varices.
To achieve more high accuracy, Kim et al recently proposed a 
novel prediction model (liver stiffness-spleen diameter to platelet 
ratio score [LSPS]) using TE values and other parameters that re￾flect portal hypertension as constituent variables in patients with 
CHB.69 Overall, this model had excellent diagnostic accuracy for 
prediction of high risk esophageal varices (HEV, AUROC=0.953; 
negative predictive value 94.7%, positive predictive value 93.3%). 
Beyond this cross-sectional analysis, a subsequent study by same 
group recently reported that LSPS can be a reliable predictor of 
the development of variceal bleeding.70 In this prospective, longi￾tudinal study of 577 patients with CHB, those with LSPS ≥5.5 had 
higher cumulative incidence rates of esophageal variceal bleeding 
during the follow-up period and LSPS score ≥6.5 was an inde￾pendent risk factor of variceal bleeding from HEV, indicating that 
prophylactic treatment should be considered in these high risk 
patients (Fig. 2). 
PREDICTION OF HCC DEVELOPMENT
Given that advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are the most 
important risk factors of HCC development, several Asian studies 
have investigated the clinical role of TE for predicting HCC de￾velopment.71-73 The first large prospective study of 866 Japanese 
patients with CHC was conducted to investigate whether TE could 
predict the risk of HCC development.71 In this study, TE value was 
selected as one of independent risk factors for HCC development, 
and patients with higher TE values had a significantly higher risk 
of HCC development, with a hazard ratio of 16.7 with 10.1-15 
kPa, 20.9 with 15.1-20 kPa, 25.6 with 20.1-25 kPa, 45.5 with over 
25 kPa, as compared to under 10 kPa (Fig. 3A). Similarly, in popu￾lations with CHB, the similar role of TE was confirmed in large 
cohort study of 1,130 Korean patients with CHB.72 In this study, 
stratified TE value was also identified as an independent risk fac￾tor for HCC development, with relative risks of 3.07, 4.68, 5.55, 
and 6.60 for respective TE values of 8-13 kPa, 13-18 kPa, 18-23 
kPa, and >23 kPa compared TE value to under 8 kPa (Fig. 3B). In￾terestingly, when patients with available follow-up TE values were 
analyzed, the risk of HCC development can be changed according 
to the pattern of the changes in TE values, which proposed the 
potential role for TE as a dynamic monitoring tool for risk estima￾tion of HCC development. In addition, another prospective study 
by Fung et al also demonstrated the usefulness of TE for prediction 
of HCC development in patients with 528 HBeAg-negative CHB.73
Although the performance of TE and a TE based model (LSPS)

for prediction of HCC was superior to other non-invasive fibrosis 
prediction models, such as APRI, age-spleen-platelet ratio index 
(ASPRI), P2/MS, and FIB-4,74 the role of TE in this setting need to 
be validated in other ethnicities.71-73
Lastly, a recent study by Kim et al reported that the TE could 
predict the development of liver-related event (LREs) including 
hepatic decompensation and HCC development in patients with 
CHB with histologically advanced liver fibrosis (≥F3).75 TE values 
was selected as independent predictor of LRE development and 
patients with a TE value>19 kPa were at significantly greater risk 
than those with a TE value ≤19 kPa.
USEFULNESS OF TE IN SURGICAL SETTING
Because, TE values show significant correlations with portal 
hypertension and HCC development, prediction of postoperative 
short term outcomes such as hepatic insufficiency and long-term 
outcomes such as recurrence or liver-related death using TE has 
been tested in several pilot studies.76-78 If further studies validate 
these results, TE will facilitate stratification of patients according 
to different prognosis assessed using TE values.
Postoperative hepatic insufficiency
Recently, our group has investigated whether preoperative TE 
values could predict the development of postoperative hepatic 
insufficiency after curative resection of HCC.76 In this study, multi￾variate analysis revealed that TE values >25.6 kPa was identified 
as the only predictor of postoperative insufficiency. The AUROC 
of 25.6 kPa was higher than that of ICG R15 (0.824 vs. 0.620, 
respectively). Similar results were obtained in a subsequent inves￾tigation by our group.77 In this study, the performance of TE was 
superior to that of diffusion-weighted MRI, which has also been 
known as a noninvasive fibrosis prediction tool, for assessment 
of liver fibrosis and prediction of postoperative hepatic insuffi￾ciency.77
HCC recurrence after curative resection
Our group also investigated whether preoperative TE could 
predict recurrence after curative resection of HCC, based on the 
assumption that the severity of liver fibrosis assessed using TE is 
correlated with de novo recurrence of HCC.78 In an analysis of 133 
patients who underwent preoperative TE and curative resection 
(HCC recurred in 62 patients), TE was selected as an independent 
predictor of recurrence, whereas the histological fibrosis status 
was not. In the study, patient with preoperative TE values >13.4 
kPa were at greater risk for recurrence with a hazard ratio of 1.925 
(P=0.010, Fig. 4). More specifically, when recurrence was strati￾fied into early (<2 year) and late (≥2 year) recurrence, TE values 
were significantly related to late recurrence. These results suggest
that preoperative TE could reveal the potential influence of liver 
fibrosis on recurrence and explain multicentric carcinogenesis from 
a fibrotic liver. However, more data are needed to clarify this is￾sue.78
Recurrence of hepatitis C after transplantation
Several studies have suggested that TE could predict fibro￾sis progression in patients with recurrent hepatitis C after liver 
transplantation.79,80 Initial study by Carrión et al reported that an 
AUROC was 0.90 for significant fibrosis and 0.98 for cirrhosis in 
124 liver transplant recipients with recurrent hepatitis C infection. 
Using a cutoff value of 8.5 kPa, the sensitivity, specificity, nega￾tive predictive value, and positive predictive value for diagnosis 
of significant liver fibrosis were 90%, 81%, 79%, and 92%, re￾spectively.80 Similar results were reported in several subsequent 
studies.81,82 In addition, Rigamonti et al showed that TE values 
changed in parallel with fibrosis staging in patients with paired LB 
during the post-liver transplantation follow-up period.79
Figure 4. Cumulative incidence rates of HCC recurrence based on 
stratified TE values (Kaplan-Meier plot). The cumulative incidence rates 
increased significantly in patients with TE >13.4 kPa than in those with 
TE ≤13.4 kPa (log-rank test, P=0.009). HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;

LIMITATIONS AND FAILURE
Although TE has revealed excellent diagnostic accuracy with 
excellent inter-observer and intra-observer agreement, there are 
some confounding factors which influence the results of TE. At 
first, the extent of necroinflammatory activity has been known 
to influence TE results in patients with viral hepatitis, resulting in 
an overestimation of TE values that increases in parallel with the 
degree of histological activity.16,83-85 Therefore, in patients with 
acute flare, TE examinations should be delayed until ALT levels are 
stabilized. Regarding this issue, several studies have tried to inves￾tigate the optimal period (3 to 6 months) to restore of reliability of 
TE values in patients with acute flare.16,86,87
In addition, the performance of TE can be limited in patients 
with a high body mass index (BMI), or narrow intercostal space, 
and it is impossible in patients with ascites.5
 In a previous study, 
BMI>28 kg/m2
 and waist circumference were significantly associ￾ated with TE failure.88 To achieve technological improvement in 
these patients, new TE probe (XL Probe) was recently introduced 
to lessen TE failure rate in obese patients, however its efficacy 
should be further validated.89 
CONCLUSION
Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in 
regarding non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with 
CLD. Of the methods now available, TE appears to be an excellent 
tool for assessment of liver fibrosis, particularly for diagnosis cir￾rhosis, and also has prognostic value in longitudinal perspectives. 
Although TE cannot completely abolish the need for LB, it can be 
used as an important noninvasive tool which enables us set up a 
more efficient and tailored management strategies for patients 
with CLD.
