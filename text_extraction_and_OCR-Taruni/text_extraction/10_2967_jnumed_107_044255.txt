Small-animal models are crucial to gain insights in the complex
recovery mechanisms of liver function during liver regeneration.
99mTc-Mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) has been in￾troduced for noninvasive assessment of liver function in the clin￾ical setting as well as in experimental research. However, HBS is
restricted to planar modalities in small animals because hepatic
kinetics are generally too fast for SPECT acquisition. 99mTc￾DTPA-galactosyl serum albumin (where DTPA is diethylenetria￾minepentaacetic acid) (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy is an alternative,
receptor-mediated, noninvasive liver function test. After hepatic
uptake, 99mTc-GSA remains trapped in the liver, which readily en￾ables additional SPECT for the assessment of both liver function
and liver functional volume within one test. In this study we eval￾uated the use of 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy combined with SPECT
for the assessment of liver function and liver functional volume in
normal and regenerating rat livers. Methods: The reproducibility
of 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy and SPECT was investigated by re￾peated measurements within the same rat. For the assessment
in a regenerating liver, 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy with SPECT was
performed on 1, 3, 5, and 7 d (n 5 6 rats per time point) after
70% partial hepatectomy (PH). Results: The correlation between
repeated 99mTc-GSA measurements was strong (r 5 0.75, P 5
0.019). In normal rat livers, there was a strong, significant correla￾tion between liver functional volume and conventional liver vol￾ume (r 5 0.93; , 0.0001). The correlation between 99mTc-GSA
uptake and liver volume was moderate (r 5 0.62, P 5 0.043). Dur￾ing the regeneration process, 99mTc-GSA uptake was significantly
lower compared with both liver volume (P , 0.001) and liver func￾tional volume (P , 0.001), when expressed as a percentage of
baseline levels. There was a strong correlation between liver func￾tional volume and conventional liver volume in the regenerating
liver (r 5 0.92, P , 0.0001). Conclusion: 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy
combined with SPECT is a feasible, noninvasive method to as￾sess hepatic functional volume in normal rat liver as well as in
the regenerating rat liver. However, the hepatic 99mTc-GSA uptake
as a liver function test seems to underestimate hepatic regenera￾tion in comparison to liver volume.

Partial liver resection is the most effective treatment for
primary and secondary liver malignancies (1). To ensure
safe postoperative recovery, sufficient remnant liver volume
and function are crucial as posthepatectomy liver failure
still has high mortality. When sufficient remnant liver is
present, the liver has the unique ability to regenerate to its
original size. Several conditions are known to influence liver
regeneration, including the extent of resection, the presence
of underlying parenchymal liver disease (2), diabetes, and
the age of the patient (3). Impaired liver regeneration can
cause serious clinical problems, such as delayed recovery of
postoperative liver function and increased risk of postoper￾ative liver failure.
Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying
the complex recovery of hepatocellular volume and func￾tion that occur during liver regeneration are not completely
understood. As liver regeneration is difficult to study in
humans, a standardized rat model of 70% partial hepatec￾tomy (PH) is commonly used. In this model, liver regen￾eration is generally assessed by measuring the increase of
liver volume and the mitotic index (2,4). However, as dem￾onstrated in clinical studies, liver volume does not always
represent liver function, indicating the importance of addi￾tional functional assessment of the liver during liver
regeneration (5–7). Development of new therapeutic strat￾egies to enhance liver regeneration has further increased the
importance of additional functional assessment in the rat
model. To facilitate and reduce the number of animals
needed for research in the field of liver surgery, noninvasive

assessment of liver function has been introduced using
99mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) in both
acute and chronic experimental animal models (8–11). How￾ever, scintigraphic imaging acquisition is restricted to planar
modalities because hepatic kinetics of 99mTc-mebrofenin in
small animals are too fast for (pinhole) SPECT acquisition.
An alternative radiopharmaceutical for liver function scin￾tigraphy is 99mTc-DTPA-galactosyl serum albumin (where
DTPA is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) (99mTc-GSA)
(12). Although it is not registered for clinical use outside
Japan, 99mTc-GSA is available for preclinical investigation
elsewhere. 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy is based on the hepatic
pharmacokinetics of asialoglycoproteins (ASGP). ASGP is a
serum galactose-terminated glycoprotein, which binds to the
ASGP receptor and is subsequently internalized via receptor
mediated endocytosis. The ASGP receptor is expressed in
large quantities on the hepatocyte sinusoidal surface (13)
and its expression reflects the severity of chronic liver
disease, such as cirrhosis (14–16). 99mTc-GSA was devel￾oped as a synthetic asialoglyoprotein to visualize and
quantify its hepatic binding to the ASGP receptor. After
intravenous injection and hepatic uptake, 99mTc-GSA remains
trapped in the liver for at least 30 min (17). This would
potentially enable pinhole SPECT acquisition in small labo￾ratory animals for the assessment of both liver function and
liver functional volume.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of 99mTc￾GSA scintigraphy as a liver function imaging technique in
combination with 99mTc-GSA SPECT for additional as￾sessment of liver functional volume in a normal and regen￾erating rat liver.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Reagents
Male Wistar rats (Harlan) were acclimatized for 1 wk under
standardized laboratory conditions in a temperature-controlled
room with a 12 h-light/12-h dark cycle on standard rat chow and
water ad libitum. 99mTc-GSA was kindly provided by Nihon
Mediphysics. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics and
Welfare Committee of the Academic Medical Center, University
of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
Camera Design
For imaging of 99mTc-GSA uptake in the rat liver, a g-camera
(ARC 3000; Philips) available in a dedicated animal care facility
was equipped with a pinhole collimator fitted with a 3-mm tung￾sten insert. The pinhole collimator was facing up. On the detector,
a mechanical support was mounted in which the animal is fixed in
an acrylic cylinder positioned exactly above the pinhole collima￾tor. The mechanical support was designed to place the midline of
the cylinder exactly in the middle of the pinhole. The position of
the animal is adjustable in the axial dimension. Furthermore, the
distance from the cylinder to the pinhole aperture is adjustable.
Therefore, this gantry permits optimal pinhole scintigraphy of
anterior projections of rats, standardizing magnification and ori￾entation (18). The g-camera is interfaced to a Hermes acquisition
station (Nuclear Diagnostics).
Scintigraphy and Interpretation
The animals were sedated with a mixture of O2/N2O (1:1 v/v, 2
L/min) and isoflurane (2%–3% Florene; Abbott Laboratories
Ltd.). Once anesthetized, a bolus of 40 MBq 99mTc-GSA in 0.3
mL saline was injected in the tail vein. The animals were scanned
on injection of the radiopharmaceutical in anterior position with
the liver and the mediastinum in the field of view (FOV). For
dynamic 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy, images were obtained for 30
min (10 min at 5 s per frame and 20 min at 60 s per frame) at the
140-keV 99mTc peak with a 20% window in a 128 · 128 matrix.
Data were processed on a Hermes workstation (Nuclear Diagnos￾tics). In clinical studies, liver function, measured by 99mTc-GSA
scintigraphy, is expressed by many different, sometimes complex,
parameters. The most commonly used parameters in planar,
dynamic 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy are the hepatic uptake ratio of 99mTc-GSA (LHL15) and the blood clearance ratio (HH15)
(12,19) We used the 99mTc-GSA liver uptake based on a technique
described by Ekman et al. (20). The algorithm was adapted for rat
scintigraphy based on the faster hepatic uptake of 99mTc-GSA in
rats (21). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the liver,
heart, and large vessels within the mediastinum (serving as blood
pool) and around the total FOV (indicative of total activity). The
liver ROI was drawn automatically on a threshold-based algorithm
using 20% of the maximum liver value on a summed image of the
first 2.5 min of the acquisition as cutoff. Three different time–
activity curves were generated based on the liver, blood pool, and
total FOV. Liver uptake was calculated in %/min, based on these 3
parameters. Calculations of hepatic 99mTc-GSA uptake were
performed using scanned radioactivity values acquired between
60 and 180 s after injection to make sure that calculations were
made during a phase of homogeneous distribution of the agent in
the blood pool.
SPECT acquisition was performed 30 min after intravenous
injection of 99mTc-GSA. Fifty projections (128 · 128 matrix) were
made in a 360 orbit. The acquisition time per projection was 25 s.
SPECT reconstruction was performed with a Hermes application
program adapted to pinhole SPECT, using filtered backprojection
(Fig. 1) (18). A Butterworth postreconstruction filter (order 5; 0.8
cycle/cm) was applied. After completion of the reconstruction, the
outline extraction method with a threshold of 40% of the maximal
voxel count value was applied for determination of the liver
functional volume (22).

Reproducibility
Nine rats were anesthetized by inhalation with a mixture of O2/
N2O (1:1 v/v, 2 L/min) and isoflurane 2%–3% and scanned on 2
separate days with a 2 d time interval, to assess the reproducibility
of scintigraphic liver function testing and intrasubject variation.
Subsequently, a SPECT acquisition of 25 min was made. After the
final scintigraphy, livers were removed and the liver volume and
weight were determined. Conventional liver volume was calcu￾lated as previously described (23).
Surgical Procedure
Rats (250–300 g) were anesthetized by a mixture of O2/N2O
(1:1 v/v, 2 L/min) and isoflurane 2%–3% and adequate analgesia
was achieved by administration of buprenorphine (Temgesic
[Schering-Plough], subcutaneous; 0.33 mg/kg). After midline
laparotomy, the liver was mobilized. Partial (70%) hepatectomy
was performed by resecting median and left lateral lobes. The
abdomen was closed in 2 layers using a 4/0 Vicryl suture
(Ethicon), and the animals were allowed to wake up.
Experimental Groups
Two groups of rats in different weight categories, group A;
250–300 g (n 5 6) and group B; 300–350 g (n 5 6), were used to
compare liver volume and liver functional volume measured by
99mTc-GSA SPECT. For the assessment of liver regeneration, 30
rats were randomized into 5 experimental groups. In a control
group (n 5 6), 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy with SPECT was
performed to calculate normal (baseline) 99mTc-GSA uptake and
liver functional volume. Subsequently, rats were sacrificed to
determine baseline liver weight and liver volume. For the assess￾ment of liver regeneration, rats were anaesthetized 1 (n 5 6), 3
(n 5 6), 5 (n 5 6) and 7 (n 5 6) days after 70% PH and 99mTc￾GSA scintigraphy with SPECT was performed to calculate 99mTc￾GSA uptake and liver functional volume. After sacrifice, liver
weight and conventional liver volume were determined.
Statistical Analysis
Commercial computer packages were used for the analysis of
the data (GraphPad Prism 4; SPSS 12.01 for Windows). Contin￾uous data was compared by independent sample t test and ex￾pressed as mean 6 SE of the mean (SEM). A correlation between
variables was tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient r.
The scintigraphy calculations were further analyzed to the method
of Bland–Altman, which is a supplementary method to compare 2
different methods when the true value is unknown. The data was
plotted as scatter plot of the mean values versus the difference of
both calculations. Differences between postoperative 99mTc-GSA
uptake, liver functional volume and conventional volume mea￾surements were evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank test and
a nonparametric repeated measurement ANOVA test. All statisti￾cal tests were 2-tailed and differences were considered significant
at a P value , 0.05.
RESULTS
Reproducibility of 99mTc-GSA Calculations
The hepatic uptake of 99mTc-GSA was homogenous in all
liver lobes (Fig. 2). The uptake rate remained constant after
10 min of imaging. The 99mTc-GSA uptake was measured
twice within the same animal, with a time interval of 2 d.
No remaining radioactivity was detected in the second
measurement before reinjection. There was a strong corre￾lation between the 2 measurements (Fig. 3A; Pearson r 5
0.75, P 5 0.019). Bland–Altman analysis (Fig. 3B)
revealed only a small bias between the 2 observers (mean
bias of 21.49%/min [4.5%]) with the 95% limit of agree￾ment between 210.22%/min and 7.24%/min.
Comparison Between Functional Volume, 99mTc-GSA
Uptake, and Liver Volume in Normal Livers
Comparison between conventional liver volume and liver
functional volume measured by 99mTc-GSA SPECT was
performed in 2 groups (n 5 6) of rats in different weight
categories (group A; 250–300 g; and group B, 300–350 g).
One rat was excluded because of subcutaneous injection of
99mTc-GSA. Conventional liver volume and liver functional
volume in group A was 12.38 6 0.32 mL and 12.33 6 0.25
mL, respectively, and in group B was 18.23 6 0.45 mL and
17.33 6 0.68 mL, respectively. Conventional liver volume
and liver functional volume were significantly different
between the 2 groups (P 5 0.0043, P 5 0.002; Mann–
Whitney test). 99mTc-GSA uptake in group A was 25.40%
6 0.87%/min and in group B was 33.10% 6 2.07%/min.
99mTc-GSA uptake was not significantly different between
the groups (P 5 0.052). There was no significant difference
between liver volume and functional volume within both
groups (P 5 0.079 and P 5 0.18). The correlation between
conventional liver volume and liver functional volume was
strong and significant (Pearson r 5 0.971, P , 0.0001; Fig.
4A). The correlation between GSA uptake and conventional
liver volume was moderate (Pearson r 5 0.62, P 5 0.043;
Fig. 4B).
Liver Volume During Liver Regeneration
Mean conventional liver volume was decreased 1 d after
70% PH (6.77 6 0.12 mL) compared with baseline (12.38
6 0.32 mL), after which it increased from 9.08 6 0.77 mL
at day 3 to normal liver volume at day 5 (12.15 6 0.45 mL)
and day 7 (11.76 6 0.50 mL, Fig. 5A).
99mTc-GSA SPECT was used to calculate functional liver
volume. The mean baseline functional volume was 12.14 6
0.20 mL. One day after PH, functional volume was reduced
to 8.07 6 0.27 mL. Similar to conventional liver volume,
the functional volume increased by day 3 (9.68 6 0.92 mL)
to normal liver functional volume on day 5 (11.82 6 0.39
mL) and day 7 (11.80 6 0.37 mL) (Fig. 5A).
There was a significant difference at day 1 between
conventional liver volume and liver functional volume
assessed by 99mTc-GSA SPECT (6.77 6 0.12 mL and
8.07 6 0.27 mL, respectively; P 5 0.048, Wilcoxon signed
rank test). There were no significant differences between
the volumes assessed by both methods at baseline, 3, 5, and
7 d after 70% PH, (P 5 0.14, P 5 0.71, P 5 0.69 and P 5
0.92, respectively). The correlation between the 2 volumes
in the regenerating liver was strong and significant (Pearson
r 5 0.924, P , 0.0001; Fig. 5B).

99mTc-GSA Uptake During Liver Regeneration
The mean baseline level of 99mTc-GSA uptake in a
normal liver was 27.08% 6 1.82%/min. One day after 70%
PH, the 99mTc-GSA uptake (8.01% 6 0.62%/min) signif￾icantly decreased compared with baseline. At 3, 5, and 7 d
after resection, 99mTc-GSA uptake increased again to
10.34% 6 0.46%/min, 13.53% 6 1.20%/min, and
21.71% 6 1.94%/min, respectively (Fig. 6).
To investigate if the decrease in uptake of 99mTc-GSA
was mainly due to the decrease in liver weight after 70%
PH, the 99mTc-GSA uptake was divided by total liver (wet)
weight. The mean baseline level of 99mTc-GSA uptake in a
normal liver was 2.44% 6 0.07%/min per gram liver. One
day after 70% PH, the 99mTc-GSA uptake per gram liver
decreased significantly to 1.51% 6 0.08%/min/g (vs.
baseline, P , 0.008; Mann–Whitney test) (Table 1). At 3

and 5 d after 70% PH, it decreased to 1.46% 6 0.13%/min/
g and 1.32% 6 0.10%/min/g, respectively (vs. baseline,
P 5 0.008 and P 5 0.004, respectively; Mann–Whitney
test). At day 7, the 99mTc-GSA uptake per liver weight had
returned to baseline level—that is, 2.18% 6 0.13%/min/g
(vs. baseline, P 5 0.08; Mann–Whitney test).
Comparison Between 99mTc-GSA Uptake, Liver
Functional Volume, and Liver Volume During Liver
Regeneration
To compare 99mTc-GSA uptake, liver functional volume,
and conventional liver volume during liver regeneration,
data were expressed as a percentage of baseline measure￾ments (Fig. 7). During the regeneration process, there were
no significant differences between conventional liver vol￾ume and liver functional volume assessed by 99mTc-GSA
SPECT (P 5 0.144, nonparametric repeated measurement
ANOVA). There were, however, significant differences
between 99mTc-GSA uptake and liver volume (P ,
0.001) and liver functional volume (P , 0.001). When
the separate time points were analyzed, significant differ￾ences between 99mTc-GSA uptake and liver volume were
found at day 1 (P , 0.001), day 3 (P 5 0.09), and day 5
(P , 0.001) after 70% PH. At day 7, there were no
significant differences (P 5 0.14).
DISCUSSION
The liver has the unique ability to regenerate after a
partial liver resection. In the clinical setting, liver regener￾ation is traditionally evaluated using CT volumetry. How￾ever, during liver regeneration, hepatic volume does not
always represent hepatocellular function (5–7). Conse￾quently, additional functional assessment of the regenerat￾ing liver should be considered.
As liver regeneration is difficult to study in humans, a
standardized rat model of 70% PH is commonly used.
Similar to the clinical situation, liver regeneration is gen￾erally assessed by increase of liver volume. Only a few
studies have investigated the recovery of liver function after
PH. In this study we evaluated the utility of 99mTc-GSA
scintigraphy combined with SPECT for the assessment of
liver function and liver functional volume in normal and
regenerating rat liver.
99mTc-GSA liver scintigraphy was developed in Japan as
a noninvasive liver function test. The liver is the only
uptake site for 99mTc-GSA and, therefore, it is an ideal
agent for functional liver scintigraphy. It is assumed that the
ligand–receptor binding is a second-order process, in which
a significant fraction of receptor is occupied during the
course of the imaging study. 99mTc-GSA remains trapped in
the liver for at least 30 min (17). This enables SPECT
acquisitions in small laboratory animals for the assessment
of both liver function and liver functional volume.
Clinical studies report a correlation with conventional
liver function tests, including antithrombin III, total and
direct bilirubin, prothrombin time, indocyanine green clear￾ance, Child–Pugh classification, and histology (hepatic ac￾tivity index score) (19,24). However, the broader use of
99mTc-GSA liver scintigraphy has been hampered by the
fact that it has not been approved for clinical use in Europe

and the United States. 99mTc-GSA is available for preclin￾ical investigation outside of Japan. In the clinical situation,
liver function measured by 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy, is
expressed by many different, sometimes complex, param￾eters (12,19,25–28). In our study, we applied a method that
calculates the hepatic binding rate on the basis of liver
99mTc-GSA uptake and the count ratio of liver to blood
pool. 99mTc-GSA SPECT was used for the calculation of
liver functional volume, using the outline extraction
method (29).
In the normal rat, as well as during the regeneration process
of the liver, we demonstrated a strong correlation between
conventional liver volume and liver functional volume
Therefore, 99mTc-GSA SPECT is an accurate, non invasive
method to assess liver functional volume in normal rat liver.
After 70% PH, a discrepancy between volumetric
(99mTc-GSA SPECT, conventional analysis) and functional
(99mTc-GSA uptake) recovery was observed during the
regeneration process. 99mTc-GSA uptake underestimated
hepatic regeneration in comparison with liver volume. In
both clinical and experimental studies, a discrepancy has
been described between volumetric regeneration and func￾tional regeneration after PH. Tanaka et al. reported that
functional regeneration was impaired in large resections in
comparison with volumetric regeneration (28).This can be
explained by the theory that, during liver regeneration,
hepatocyte proliferation is promoted at the expense of liver
function (30). Others, however, concluded that the func￾tional regeneration was more rapid than the morphologic
regeneration (6,7). These results support the theory that
hepatocyte function is upregulated after major hepatic
resection to compensate for the reduced liver mass
(22,31,32). Therefore, it remains difficult to draw conclu￾sions with regard to the difference between functional and
volumetric regeneration.
In our study, 99mTc-GSA uptake was decreased in the
first days after partial liver resection, which was not only
due to the decrease in liver weight after resection. The
99mTc-GSA uptake per gram liver was significantly de￾creased during the first days after resection, which returned
to baseline at day 7. Although the uptake of 99mTc-GSA is
influenced by blood flow, liver perfusion is increased after
partial liver resection due to the fact that the complete
portal flow is directed through the small remnant liver (33).
When the remnant liver increases, portal perfusion returns
to baseline levels. It has been suggested that increased liver
perfusion after resection is one of the main triggers for
regeneration (33). Therefore, it is unlikely that the decrease
in 99mTc-GSA uptake, as found in this study, results from a
change in liver perfusion because this is increased during
the first days after liver resection.
The decrease in uptake per gram liver can be explained
by a decrease in ASGP receptors per hepatocyte, a decrease
in affinity of the ASGP receptor, or a decrease in the
amount of hepatocytes per gram liver. In vitro studies have
described a decrease in surface ASGP receptors during liver
FIGURE 6. 99mTc-GSA uptake decreased the first day after
70% PH, after which it slowly recovered to baseline uptake at
day 7 after resection.

regeneration (34,35). Mechanisms of decreased cell-surface
ASGP receptors include the secretion of the ASPG receptor
into the extracellular space and reduced recycling of the
receptor after endocytosis (34). Our results may support the
theory that the amount of ASGP receptors is decreased, and
it is uncertain whether dynamic 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy
still accurately represents liver function during the early
phase of regeneration. Therefore, further validation and
investigation of possible mechanisms of the decrease of
ASGP receptor is advised before it can be used for the
assessment of liver function in a regenerating rat liver.
CONCLUSION
99mTc-GSA scintigraphy combined with SPECT is a
feasible, noninvasive method to assess hepatic volume in
normal rat liver as well as in the regenerating rat liver.
However, the hepatic 99mTc-GSA uptake seems to under￾estimate hepatic regeneration, possibly due to a decrease of
ASGP receptors in the early phase after PH.
