Abstract. In order to determine the diagnostic efficacy of 
microRNA (miR)‑122‑5p and to identify the potential molec￾ular signaling pathways underlying the function of miR‑122‑5p 
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the expression profiles of 
data collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and literature databases were 
analyzed, along with any associations between clinicopatho￾logical characteristics and the diagnostic value of miR‑122‑5p 
in HCC. The intersection of 12 online prediction databases 
and differentially expressed genes from TCGA and GEO 
were utilized in order to select the prospective target genes of 
miR‑122‑5p in HCC. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein‑protein interac￾tion network (PPI) analyses were subsequently performed 
based on the selected target genes. The average expression 
level of miR‑122‑5p was decreased in HCC patients compared 
with controls from TCGA database (P<0.001), and the down￾regulation of miR‑122‑5p was significantly associated with 
HCC tissues (P<0.001), tumor vascular invasion (P<0.001), 
metastasis (P=0.001), sex (P=0.006), virus infection status 
(P=0.001) and tissue (compared with serum; P<0.001) in cases 
from the GEO database. The pooled sensitivity and specificity 
for miR‑122‑5p to diagnose HCC were 0.60 [95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.48‑0.71] and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70‑0.89), respec￾tively. The area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.76 (95% 
CI, 0.72‑0.80), while in Meta‑DiSc 1.4, the AUC was 0.76 
(Q*
=0.70). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.60 
(95% CI, 0.57‑0.62) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76‑0.81), respectively. 
A total of 198 overlapping genes were selected as the potential 
target genes of miR‑122‑5p, and 7 genes were defined as the 
hub genes from the PPI network. Cell division cycle 6 (CDC6), 
minichromosome maintenance complex component 4 
(MCM4) and MCM8, which serve pivotal functions in the 
occurrence and development of HCC, were the most signifi￾cant hub genes. The regulation of cell proliferation for cellular 
adhesion and the biosynthesis of amino acids was highlighted 
in the GO and KEGG pathway analyses. The downregulation 
of miR‑122‑5p in HCC demonstrated diagnostic value, worthy 
of further attention. Therefore, miR‑122‑5p may function as a 
tumor suppressor by modulating genome replication.
Introduction
Ranking fifth most common malignancies, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) is diagnosed in >500,000 individuals 
worldwide (2011) (1). With an increasing incidence, HCC has 
become the third most common cause of cancer‑associated 
mortality worldwide (2010) (2). The majority of patients with 
HCC exhibit aggressive symptoms upon diagnosis and the 
median 1‑year survival rate is <30% (3,4). Traditionally, HCC 
is detected using biomarkers, including α‑fetoprotein (5,6), 
with 39‑65% sensitivity and 76‑94% specificity (7). Several 
biomarkers, such as miR‑101‑1, miR‑221, miR‑638 can be 
used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of HCC (8‑10). 
However, there are still a number of biomarkers that may be 
biologically relevant for the development of HCC. Therefore, 
a more efficient biomarker with improved accuracy is urgently 
required.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non‑coding RNA mole￾cules with an approximate length of 23 nucleotides. miRNAs 
serve as post‑transcriptional regulators of gene expression 
by binding to the 3'‑untranslated region of mRNA (11,12).

WEN et al: CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND FUNCTION OF miR-122-5p IN HCC 6919
Previous studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation 
of specific miRNAs contributes to the progression of hepa￾tocarcinogenesis (13,14). Therefore, these molecules may 
represent promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of HCC. 
A previous study demonstrated that miRNA (miR)‑122‑5p 
was downregulated in patients with HCC (15); however, its 
molecular mechanism and diagnostic significance remain to 
be elucidated.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; https://cancergenome.
nih.gov/) is a program, which contains RNA sequencing 
(RNA‑Seq) data on 32 types of tumor without limitations or 
restrictions by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the 
National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/) is an online public resource provided by the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in 2000. The 
GEO covers ample gene chip expression data, as well as data 
from non‑chip technologies, such as serial analysis of gene 
and mass spectrometry. GEO provides large quantities of 
high‑throughput data and is one of the most comprehensive 
public gene expression data resources available currently.
Therefore, the present study examined the accuracy of 
miR‑122‑5p in distinguishing HCC patients from healthy 
controls based on data collected from TCGA and GEO. The 
association between distinct clinicopathological features 
and the expression of miR‑122‑5p was also investigated. To 
further clarify the regulatory mechanism of miR‑122‑5p in 
HCC, subsequent bioinformatic analyses were conducted. 
The present study aims to perform a quantitative evaluation of 
the association between miR‑122‑5p in HCC and pathophysi￾ological processes, specifically investigating the type of genes 
and signaling pathways that are associated with downregulated 
miR‑122‑5p levels in HCC specimens.
Materials and methods
Collection of TCGA and GEO data. TCGA provided miRNA 
raw sequencing data from 370 HCC cases and 50 adjacent liver 
tissue samples. The publicly available RNA‑Seq data were 
downloaded directly from the TCGA launch data portal via 
bulk download of the liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), 
RNASeqV2 (data type) and level 3 (data level) cancer tissues 
collected on January 1, 2017 (16). Additionally, the GEO data￾base was searched and GEO datasets (GSE6857, GSE12717, 
GSE10694, GSE21279, GSE22058, GSE21362, GSE20971, 
GSE39678, GSE31383, GSE40744, GSE50013, GSE36915, 
GSE54751, GSE57555, GSE67882, GSE74618, GSE65708 
and GSE64989) (17) containing an expression profile or 
fold‑change value of miR‑122‑5p in HCC and control samples 
were included. There was no restriction on the specific type of 
non‑cancerous control. Cell line assays or assays without the 
expression value were excluded. The following information 
obtained from Genomic Spatial Event (GSE) (https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (18) chips was recorded: Main contributor 
(the name that ranked first), publishing year, country, sample 
type, experiment type, the platform of the GSE chips, and the 
number of patients with HCC and controls. All expression 
values for miR‑122‑5p in GEO were log2 scaled. The number, 
mean and standard deviation for the control and experimental 
groups were calculated based on each single gene chip.
Literature search. Pertinent studies were retrieved in PubMed 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), Wiley online library 
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/), Sciencedirect (http://www.
sciencedirect.com/), Web of science (http://login.webofknowl￾edge.com/), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials

cancer OR tumor OR tumor OR neoplasm* OR carcinoma) 
AND (hepatocellular OR liver OR hepatic OR HCC) AND

‘miRNA 122’ OR ‘microRNA 122’ OR miR‑122‑5p OR 
miRNA‑122‑5p OR microRNA‑122‑5p). Studies that did not 
provide true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative 
(TN) and false negative (FN) results were excluded. The 
author, publishing year, sample type, number of HCC patients 
and controls, and the number of TP, FP, TN and FN results 
were recorded as basic information.
Selection of prospective target genes of miR‑122‑5p. The 
potential target mRNAs of miR‑122‑5p were predicted 
based on 12 online prediction databases, including 
miRWalk, TargetScan and miRMap (19). Genes recorded in 
>5 of the 12 prediction databases were selected (20). The 
selected predicted target genes were further intersected 
with TCGA and GEO differentially expressed genes. The 
overlapping genes were considered as potential target genes 
of miR‑122‑5p.
Bioinformatic analyses using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and anno‑
tation and the protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network. 
Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and 
Integrated Discovery (DAVID; david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov), 
GO annotation was subsequently conducted based on the 
prospective target mRNAs. A total of three GO terms, 
including biological process, cellular component and molec￾ular function, were used to identify the enrichment of target 
genes. KEGG pathway analysis (www.genome.jp/kegg) was 
applied to identify noteworthy pathways associated with 
the selected target genes. The Bingo plug‑in component 
from Cytoscape 3.4.0 (www.cytoscape.org) and GraphPad 
Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, 
CA, USA) were employed to visualize the network of GO 
terms and KEGG pathways, respectively (21). GO, KEGG 
and Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships 
(PANTHER) pathway analyses were implemented in 
DAVID to summarize the essential functions of potential 
target genes of miR‑122‑5p (22). To explicitly determine the 
interactions and connections between hub genes, the PPI 
network was applied using Search Tool for the Retrieval of 
Interacting Genes/Proteins (www.string‑db.org) (23). The 
nodes and edges presented the genes and reciprocal actions 
between genes, whose number would reveal the dominant 
hub genes of miR‑122‑5p in HCC. P<0.05 was considered to 
indicate a statistically significant difference.

Statistical analysis. Student's t‑test for independent samples 
and one way analysis of variance (with Bonferroni's post‑hoc 
test) was performed using SPSS 19 software (IBM Corp., 
Armonk, NY, USA) to determine the association between the 
miR‑122‑5p expression profile and various clinicopathological 
parameters. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically 
significant difference.
SPSS 19 software was applied to generate a receiver 
operator characteristic (ROC) curve to assess diagnostic 
efficacy. The relative expression level of miR‑122‑5p from 
the microarray included in the GEO was processed sepa￾rately. All samples were pooled with HCC and controls to 
conduct another diagnostic trial. Meta‑DiSc 1.4 (http://www.
hrc.es/investigacion/metadisc_en.htm) was used to generate 
combined effect and forest plots using a random effects model. 
The sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood 
ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic score 
(DS) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were recorded. The 
area under the curve (AUC) and point where sensitivity and 
specificity are equal (index Q*
) were calculated. Threshold 
and meta‑regression analyses were conducted to determine 
heterogeneity in the present study, and P<0.1 or I2
>50% were 
considered to represent marked heterogeneity.
The analysis was repeated as aforementioned, and the 
threshold and meta‑regression analyses were performed in Stata14 
(StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Deek's funnel plot 
and Fagan plot analyses were performed to examine publication 
bias and to detect the diagnostic value of miR‑122‑5p in HCC.
Results
miR‑122‑5p expression levels and associated clinicopatho‑
logical features in TCGA and GEO datasets. The average 
expression level of miR‑122‑5p in the TCGA cohort was 
decreased in the patients with HCC compared with the 
controls (P<0.001; Fig. 1A). There were 375 patients with 
HCC and 50 controls in the TCGA cohort, and 955 patients 
with HCC and 685 controls in the GEO cohort. From the 
expression data in 20 GSE chips, all the clinicopathological 
features mentioned in chips were gathered and associations 
with miR‑122‑5p expression levels were investigated. The 
downregulation of miR‑122‑5p was associated with HCC 
tissues (P<0.001; Fig. 1B), tumor vascular invasion (P<0.001), 
metastasis (P=0.001), tissue (compared with serum) (P<0.001), 
virus infection state (P=0.001) and sex (P=0.006) in the GEO 
cohort (Table I).

Diagnostic value based on data from TCGA and GEO. The 
relative expression level of miR‑122‑5p data collected from 
TCGA demonstrated 81.07% sensitivity and 84.00% speci￾ficity. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.865 [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 0.829‑0.896; Fig. 1C]. In the GEO 
cohort, the overall SEN and the SPE were 66.77 and 79.70%, 
respectively, with an AUC of 0.749 (95% CI, 0.726‑0.771; 
Fig. 1D). The diagnostic value of every individual chip was 
also calculated (Table II) (15,24‑40).
Meta‑analysis based on the previous literature. In total, 6,854 
studies were collected from the literature. Following exclusion 
of repeated and irrelevant articles, 53 full texts were read. 
Finally, 4 studies were included (Table III; Fig. 2) (41‑44). In 
the meta‑analysis, the pooled SEN, SPE, PLR, NLR, DOR 
and AUC values were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.56‑0.86), 0.79 (95% CI, 
0.69‑0.86), 3.43 (95% CI, 2.38‑4.95), 0.34 (95% CI, 0.20‑0.59), 
10.11 (95% CI, 4.70‑21.77) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79‑0.86), 
respectively, when Stata14 was applied (Fig. 3). No significant

publication bias was observed in the meta‑analysis using 
Deek's funnel plot (P=0.10; Fig. 4). The pre‑test probability 
value of miR‑122‑5p in patients with HCC was 20%, and the 
post‑test probability values, considering PLR and NLR results, 
were 46 and 8%, respectively, based on Fagan's nomogram 
(Fig. 5). The results were also calculated using Meta‑DiSc 1.4 
(data not shown).
Overall assessment of diagnostic value. The data from GEO, 
TCGA and eligible studies were combined in order to perform 
a pooled diagnostics test. In Stata14, the pooled SEN, SPE, 
PLR, NLR and DOR values were 0.60 (95% CI, 0.48‑0.71), 
0.81 (95% CI, 0.70‑0.89), 3.20 (95% CI, 1.93‑5.30), 0.49 (95% 
CI, 0.37‑0.65) and 6.49 (95% CI, 3.23‑13.08). The AUC value 
was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72‑0.80; Fig. 6). No significant publica￾tion bias was observed in the meta‑analysis using Deek's 
funnel plot (P=0.96; Fig. 7). The pre‑test probability value for 
miR‑122‑5p expression in patients with HCC was 63%, and the 
post‑test probability values, considering PLR and NLR results, 
were 84 and 45%, respectively, based on Fagan's nomogram 
(Fig. 8). In Meta‑DiSc1.4, the pooled SEN, SPE, PLR, NLR 
and DOR values were also calculated by Meta‑DiSc 1.4 (data 
not shown).
Identification of potential target mRNAs of miR‑122‑5p. A total 
of 61,399 target genes were predicted by 12 online software 
programs, and 5,657 genes that were detected ≥5 times were 
regarded as potential target genes of miR‑122‑5p. Additionally, 
differentially expressed genes assembled from the TCGA and 
GEO databases were integrated to generate the intersection of 
the two databases. The 5,657 potential target genes intersected 
198 genes, with 3,278 differentially expressed genes from 
the TCGA database and 5,122 differentially expressed genes 
from the GEO database. These overlapping genes were used in 
subsequent bioinformatic analyses.
Bioinformatic analyses of the potential target genes of 
miR‑122‑5p. Further investigations were conducted to 
determine the functional mechanism of miR‑122‑5p in the 
progression of HCC. For the results of GO pathway analysis 
in DAVID, the potential targets of miR‑122‑5p were notably 
associated with the regulation of cell proliferation for cell 
adhesion (P=1.22x10‑4), proteinaceous extracellular matrix 
(P=1.20x10‑4) and extracellular matrix structural constituent 
(P=5.57x10‑3; Table IV; Fig. 9). Furthermore, KEGG pathway 
analysis identified biosynthesis of amino acids, carbon 
metabolism, biosynthesis of antibiotics, arginine and proline 
metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, Chagas disease (American 
trypanosomiasis), amoebiasis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, 
the pentose phosphate pathway and toxoplasmosis as signifi￾cant (P<0.05). In addition, the most enriched term in the 
PANTHER analysis was salvage pathways of pyrimidine 
deoxyribonucleotides (Table V; Fig. 10). In the PPI analysis, 
the network demonstrated 198 nodes and 57 edges (Fig. 11A). 
Genes with a combined score >0.900, based on available 
experimental data and importing known protein complexes 
from curated databases (23), including minichromosome 
maintenance complex component (MCM)4, MCM8, MCM10, 
chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1, cell divi￾sion cycle (CDC) 6, CDC25A and checkpoint kinase 1, were

defined as hub genes. CDC6, MCM4 and MCM8, with 24, 
24 and 22 interactions with other hub genes in the network, 
respectively, were recognized as hub genes of the highest 
significance (Fig. 11B).
Discussion
A number of studies have confirmed that the downregulation 
of miR‑122‑5p in HCC was associated with metastasis and a 
poor prognosis (45,46). Therefore, the present study further 
investigated these conclusions. The expression of miR‑122‑5p 
was decreased in patients with HCC compared with that in 
controls in the TCGA and GEO databases. Additionally, 
decreased miR‑122‑5p expression was significantly associated 
with metastasis and vascular invasion in the GEO dataset, 
suggesting that the downregulation of miR‑122‑5p may 
lead to a poor prognosis, and that miR‑122‑5p may act as a 
tumor suppressor in HCC. Furthermore, miR‑122‑5p expres￾sion varied in different virus infection states, indicating that 
miR‑122‑5p may be associated with virus‑associated HCC. In 
tissues, miR‑122‑5p expression was decreased compared with 
that in serum. However, reflecting the limited number of serum 
samples, further studies are required to confirm distinctions in 
the diagnostic accuracy between tissues and serum.

WEN et al: CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND FUNCTION OF miR-122-5p IN HCC 6927
With regards to diagnostic value, the pooled AUC was 0.76 
(95% CI, 0.72‑0.80), suggesting that miR‑122‑5p possessed a 
moderate degree of accuracy in diagnostic tests and that it 
may be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of patients 
with HCC. A discrepancy in sample type and patients may 
reflect the observed differences in the AUC among TCGA, 
GEO and meta‑analysis studies. Li et al (47), He et al (48) and 
Huang et al (49) conducted integrated research to examine 
the diagnostic value of miR‑122‑5p, and the AUC values were 
0.81, 0.78 and 0.77, respectively, consistent with the results of 
the present study. In search strategy, Wu et al (46) applied 2 
public databases: PubMed and Embase, Qi et al (44) applied 
Medline and CancerLit Embase prior to July 31, 2015. 
Huang et al (49) analyzed the diagnostic value of miRNAs in 
patients with HCC utilizing the Medline, Embase and CNKI 
databases. The present study aimed to explore the potential 
clinical value of miR‑122‑5p in HCC. In addition to pertinent 
literature regarding miR‑122‑5p, data from TCGA and GEO 
public databases were also extracted. The SEN, SPE, PLR, 
NLR, DS and DOR values were determined in Meta‑DiSc 1.4. 
The aforementioned study was repeated, excluding threshold 
analysis and meta‑regression in Stata14. Deek's funnel plot 
and Fagan plot were displayed to test the publication bias and 
to detect the diagnostic value of miR‑122‑5p in HCC. The 
heterogeneity in the meta‑analysis of these studies did not 
reflect a threshold effect or clinical features. Subgroup and 
meta‑regression analyses were not performed, reflecting the 
limited number of studies collected. The source of hetero￾geneity in the pooled meta‑analysis was not determined by 
meta‑regression.
In the PPI network, CDC6, MCM4 and MCM8 were 
highlighted as the most significant hub genes with multiple 
interactions in the network. Further examination of these 
notable genes would reveal the function for miR‑122‑5p in 
HCC. CDC6 is a necessary regulator of DNA replication 
and is inextricably associated with tumorigenesis (50). High 
CDC6 expression has been associated with various types of 
cancer. In ovarian cancer, Deng et al (51) discovered that the 
elevated expression of CDC6 may accelerate cell proliferation 
and worsen prognosis. In addition, CDC6 may participate in 
chemotherapy resistance in bladder cancer (52). Previous 
studies have also demonstrated oncogenetic functions for 
CDC6 in HCC (53,54). Xiong et al (55) demonstrated that 
CDC6 overexpression may increase susceptibility to HCC, 
and the Cdc6‑515A>G polymorphism may attenuate CDC6 
expression to decrease the risk of carcinogenesis. Therefore, 
studies focused on approaches to downregulate CDC6 have 
been reported. HKH40A was utilized to disrupt the cell cycle 
and to promote apoptosis, during which CDC6 was downreg￾ulated (56). MCM4 is also an essential replication modulator. 
In cervical cancer (57), non‑small cell lung cancer (58) and 
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (59), the upregulation 
of MCM4 was also observed. Studach et al (60) observed 
upregulation of MCM4 in HCC in X/c‑myc bitransgenics, 
indicating the identical expression profile of MCM4 in HCC. 
However, the MCM4 polymorphism may generate contradic￾tory results. For example, Nan et al (61) reported that MCM4 
may decrease the risk of HCC. Another notable hub gene of 
miR‑122‑5p, MCM8, which is also a gene replication regu￾lator, may modulate DNA replication through interactions 
with other MCM proteins, including the aforementioned 
MCM4 (62). MCM8 was overexpressed in chronic myelog￾enous leukemia (63) and the overexpression of MCM8 was 
associated with the poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer (64). 
However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no avail￾able studies regarding the function of MCM8 in HCC. As 
the hub genes of miR‑122‑5p with the most interactions with 
other hub genes, CDC6, MCM4 and MCM8 all exerted the 
function of genome replication. Consistently, regulation of 
cell proliferation for cell adhesion was also highlighted in the 
GO analysis. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR‑122‑5p 
may be involved in the biological process of gene replica￾tion. Considering that miR‑122‑5p exhibited significantly 
decreased expression in HCC, whereas CDC6 and MCM4 
were upregulated, miR‑122‑5p may represent a therapeutic 
target and biomarker for HCC.

In conclusion, the downregulation of miR‑122‑5p in HCC 
demonstrated diagnostic value worthy of further attention. 
Furthermore, this molecule may function as a tumor suppressor 
by modulating genome replication. Additional experiments 
and studies are required to verify this discovery.
