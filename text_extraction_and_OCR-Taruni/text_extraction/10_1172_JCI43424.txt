Early tumor dissemination, but late metastasis: 
insights into tumor dormancy
Martin Röcken
Department of Dermatology, Eberhard Karls University, Tübingen, Germany.
The classical model of metastasis is that tumor cell dissemination occurs
late in tumor development, after the primary tumor has grown, and that
only then will tumor cells invade the local tissue, enter the blood or lym￾phatic vessels, and colonize new sites to cause metastases. However, evidence
increasingly indicates that single tumor cells spread to distant sites much
earlier than previously believed.In this issue ofthe JCI, Eyles and colleagues
provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying early tumor cell dis￾semination,formation of metastases, and tumor immunosurveillance using
transgenic mice that spontaneously develop melanomas of the uvea. The
authors provide striking evidence that tumor cells start to disseminate dur￾ing the initial steps of tumor development, that late appearing metastases
arise from these early disseminated tumor cells, and thatCD8+ T cells inhibit
the growth of disseminated tumor cells, surprisingly, not by cytotoxic effects,
but through cytostatic effects.
Basic aspects of tumor 
immunosurveillance
The original concept of tumor immuno￾surveillance, as stated several decades ago
by F.M. Burnet and T.R. Prehn (1, 2), pos￾tulated that most malignant tumors that
arise are eliminated via lymphocyte-medi￾ated responses before they become clinical￾ly detectable. Having been abandoned for
decades, the concept of tumor immuno￾surveillance has been rekindled by various
observations, but its importance remains
highly debated. One important contribu￾tion to the debate was the description of
specific tumor-associated antigens (3),
because they are a prerequisite to the argu￾ment in favor of tumor-specific immuno￾surveillance. Subsequently, many data have
revealed that slowly developing, endog￾enoustumors evade the immune system by
various mechanisms. For example, malig￾nant cell clones can compromise multiple
immune functions, including immune
cell recognition of the tumor and immune
cell–mediated killing of tumor cells (4–7).
However, in early phases, tumors rarely
cause harm and are often either ignored
by the immune system or induce specific
tolerance (6, 7). To date, the question of
whether the immune system can specifi￾cally recognize and control endogenously
developing tumorsremains widely debated
(4, 7–9). In this issue of the JCI, Eyles and
colleagues provide evidence in a mouse
model of melanoma that tumor immuno￾surveillance not only controls the growth
of primary malignant tumors, but also
keeps metastatic outgrowth in check (10).
Metastasis: a classical multistep 
process, or early dissemination 
of tumor cells?
The risk of metastases increases with the
thickness of a primary tumor. Therefore,
current tumor biology concepts mainly
postulate that tumor cell dissemination
occurs late in tumor development and fol￾lows a classic multistep process (Figure
1A). First, the primary tumor grows; sec￾ond, tumor cellsinvade the local tissue and
enter the blood or lymphatic vessels; third,
tumor cells colonize new sites to cause
metastases. Yet increasing amounts of clin￾ical data have revealed that single tumor
cells spread to distant sites much earlier
than previously believed. For example, sin￾gle disseminated tumor cells can be found
in the lymph nodes or bone marrow of
healthy women with a history of early-stage
breast cancer that have no clinical evidence
of metastasis or tumor recurrence (11, 12).
Women with such dormant cancer cellslive
with an increased risk of sudden metasta￾ses, which may occur more than a decade
after primary tumor surgery. Similarly,
single melanoma cells can be found in the
lymph nodes of patients with thin melano￾mas;these single dormanttumor cellsseem
to be of prognostic relevance, as patients
can develop metastases after more than 10
years (13). Nonetheless, more than 90% of
these patients remain without metastasis
for at least 10 years after surgery.
The stealth of tumor cell dissemina￾tion and the extent to which disseminated
tumor cells can remain dormant is high￾lighted by the inadvertent transmission of
melanoma from a patient who served as an
organ donor following sudden brain death
to the organ recipients(14). At 2 years after
the donor’s kidneys had been transplanted
into 2 recipients, both recipients died from
metastases of malignant melanoma. The
donor had been treated for malignant mel￾anoma 16 years prior to his death, but was
free of secondary disease and detectable
metastases at the time he died. Thus, even
though free of clinical disease, the organ
donor had transferred melanoma cells with
the graft to the recipients, who rapidly died
from metastasizing melanoma under the
conditions of transplantation and trans￾plant-associated immunosuppression.
Insights into the early spread 
of single tumor cells from 
the leading edge of melanoma
Transplanted tumor models in rodents are
often used to study metastasis; however,
these models often fail to recapitulate the
latency between tumor cell dissemination
and metastatic outgrowth in humans. Eyles
et al. sought to overcome this issue — in
order to determine more precisely the role
of disseminated tumor cellsin the growth of
metastases and the mechanisms underlying
dormancy — using the RET.AAD spontane￾ousmousemodel ofmelanoma,inwhichthe
human RET oncogene is expressed by mela￾nocytes, leading to their oncogenic transfor￾mation (10). They found thatthe firstsingle
tumor cells tended to spread very early dur￾ing oncogenesis, less than 3 weeks after the
clinical onset of the primary tumor. At this
time,the tumorsshowed no histological evi￾Conflict of interest: The author has declared that no

dence for invasion of small vessels. Detect￾able metastases became apparent much
later in life, up to 1.5 years, which suggests
that disseminated tumor cells remained
dormant for long periods during the life
of the mice (10). To determine whether the
metastaseswere really derived from the early
spreading tumor cells, or whether they fol￾lowed a classical multistep progression, the
authors compared the genomes of primary
tumors with those of late metastases. Asthe
late metastases bore a genetic profile similar
to that of the primary tumor, and profiles
were specific for each individual mouse, it
seems that the metastases arose from the
early disseminated tumor cells (10). Thus,
both the early spread of single tumor cells
and the latency between tumor cell dissemi￾nation and metastatic outgrowth observed
in humans were modeled in RET.AAD mice
(Figure 1B).
Early tumor cell dissemination reminis￾cent of the events in human metastasis
has also been analyzed by Husemann et al.
(15) in 2 distinct transgenic mouse strains
that model breast cancer. Although these
authors did not study the latency between
tumor cell dissemination and metastatic
outgrowth, they did show that, upon adop￾tive transfer, disseminated tumor cells are
capable of homing to the bone marrow
and causing metastases. It is interesting to
note that in these breast cancer models, the
tumor cells tended to spread to the bone
marrow and the lung, whereas in the spon￾taneous melanoma model used by Eyles et
al., cells spread more diffusely (10). Impor￾tantly, in both studies, apparent meta￾static cells bore the genetic signature of
early tumor development (10, 15), further
underlining that tumor cell dissemination
is an early event. The data discussed here
indicate that tumor cells disseminate to

Models of metastasis. (A) Classical multi￾step model of metastasis. Here, tumor cells 
normally arise from late, vessel-infiltrating 
cancers. It is believed that spreading tumor 
cells either fail to enter target organs or are 
controlled by cytotoxic effects (lysis or apop￾tosis). (B) Model of metastasis as suggested 
by Eyles et al. (10). Single tumor cells start 
to spread much earlier than expected and 
form single-cell metastases. Such single-cell 
metastases remain dormant for long periods 
of time, also through cytostatic signals that 
reduce tumor cell proliferation. In the absence 
of such cytostatic signals, metastases start to 
grow rapidly.

distant sites early during primary tumor
development, but do not cause metastasis
(Figure 1B). Understanding why these dis￾seminated tumor cells fail to cause early
metastasis and what events are responsible
for tumor dormancy are key to determin￾ing whether new therapeutic interventions
can be developed for the human situation.
Evidence for immune-mediated 
tumor dormancy in the absence 
of tumor cell killing
To uncover potential mechanisms oftumor
dormancy, Eyles et al. depleted CD8+ T cells
in RET.AAD mice (10). This T cell depletion
markedly increased the risk of overt metas￾tases, directly showing a critical role for
T cell–dependent tumor immunosurveil￾lance in the early metastatic stage of this
melanoma model. The current view of T
cell–mediated tumor immunosurveillance
is that CD8+ T cells control tumor cells
through classic death-inducing mecha￾nisms (5, 9, 10). Although CD8+ T cell
depletion was the method used by Eyles et
al. to uncover a role for T cell–dependent
tumor immunosurveillance in keeping
disseminated tumor cells from forming
metastases, the authors present an addi￾tional, surprising piece of data contradict￾ing this classic hypothesis: In the presence
of CD8+ T cells, the number of Ki67+ tumor
cells is low, whereas the number of Ki67+
tumor cells is high in the absence of CD8+
T cells. As expression of Ki67 is associated
with cell proliferation and cell cycle pro￾gression, these data strongly argue that,
besides the known cytotoxic effects, a
cytostatic mode of tumor silencing may be
keeping the disseminated tumor cellsfrom
forming metastases (Figure 1B).
Müller-Hermelink et al. recently showed
that immune-mediated arrest of endog￾enous tumor development is associated
with a substantial reduction in tumor cell
proliferation (16). Using BrdU incorpora￾tion, apoptosis assays, and CD8+ T cell
depletion, they found that CD4+ Th1 cells
could induce a state of tumor dormancy by
reducing tumor cell proliferation and cell
cycle progression through strictly IFN-γ–
and TNF-dependent signals. Arresting
tumor growth required neither detectable
signs of tumor cell killing nor apoptosis.
Thisisinlinewithotherrecentreportsshow￾ing that T cell immunity can induce tumor
dormancy with little or no signs of either
tumor cell killing or apoptosis (17–19).
In all of these reports, tumor dormancy
required IFN-γ– or TNF-mediated signal￾ing. Interestingly, thisisin accordance with
an increasing number ofstudiesin humans
showing that immunotherapy with type I
IFNs or vaccine strategiesthatinduce type II
IFN–producing Th1 immune responses
are needed to inhibit tumor progression
and prolong overall survival (7, 9, 20, 21).
The importance of both type I and type II
IFNs has been extensively studied in experi￾mental mice (9) and is underlined by sur￾prising data from humans as well as from
experimental animals: in the absence of
IFNs or Th1 cells, tumor immunity not
only fails to protect against tumors, but
can even promote tumor progression (16,
19, 20). That said, it will be important to
uncoverthe mechanisms underlying tumor
dormancy elicited by type I or type II IFNs;
it has been proposed that antiangiogenic
effects might contribute, as some tumor
cells may not express appropriate IFN
receptors. Yet, in a number of clinical trials,
antiangiogenic therapies were less efficient
than hoped, and some tumors may even
develop a more aggressive phenotype in the
presence of antiangiogenic drugs (22). It is
therefore unlikely that the tumor-protec￾tive effects of IFNs can be reduced to their
antiangiogenic effects.
Can inhibition of cell cycle 
progression cause tumor dormancy?
Today it is known that disseminated single
tumor cells rarely cause metastases, and if
they do, it is frequently many years after
they reached their distant site. However,
the mechanisms underlying tumor dor￾mancy remain a major mystery. Müller￾Hermelink et al. (16) and Eyles et al. (10)
independently found that tumorimmuno￾surveillance correlated with a substantial
reduction in either BrdU+ or Ki67+ tumor
cells, key findings characteristic of inhibi￾tion of cell proliferation and cell cycle pro￾gression, and that tumor-specific T cells
prevented tumor growth in the absence
of histological evidence for major tumor
cell killing or apoptosis. It is therefore dif￾ficult to imagine that the immune system
controls disseminated tumor cells only
by mechanisms of direct killing; rather,
it is likely that immunosurveillance also
induces tumor dormancy through other
mechanisms that are still poorly inves￾tigated. IFNs and TNF both are not only
involved in killing and apoptosis; they
have pleiotropic effects on the metabolism
of somatic cells through the control of
signaling cascades that regulate cell prolif￾eration and cell cycle progression and the
control of signaling molecules that influ￾ence cell differentiation and the process
of transformation (9, 10, 16). Therefore,
immunosurveillance may indeed induce
dormancy in single, disseminated tumor
cells by arresting their cell cycle through
cytokine-mediated signals. This would
also explain why late metastases mightstill
bear the genetic signature of early dissemi￾nated tumor cells (10, 15).
Perspectives
These insights, arising from a number of
observations in mice and humans, reveal
that the classical immunological con￾cept of tumor eradication by tumor cell
killing should be abandoned. They raise
important questions that should affect
the design of future immune therapies.
If single tumor cells emigrate early, why
do overt metastases appear only at later
tumor stages? Is this a question of quan￾tity, or are there specific signals? How does
the immune system controlsingle, dissem￾inated tumor cells and micrometastasis
and establish tumor dormancy, and what
awakens disseminated tumor cells and
makes them grow into metastases?

Gazing into a crystal ball 
to predict kidney transplant outcome
Bernd Schröppel1 and Peter S. Heeger2

Kidney transplantation is the optimal therapy for end-stage kidney disease
but requires lifelong immunosuppression. Despite improvements in immu￾nosuppression regimens that have reduced rates of acute transplant rejec￾tion, long-term allograft survival remains suboptimal. More than 50% of
transplanted kidneys from deceased donors fail within 10 years. In order to
improve long-term outcomes, physicians need to better understand mecha￾nisms underlying transplant rejection and tolerance in humans. They also
need biomarkers that differentiate patients likely to maintain excellent and
stable allograft function from recipients at risk of losing their transplants.
By studying kidney transplant recipients at high risk for graft loss and rare,
spontaneously tolerant kidney transplant recipients, researchers reporting
in 3 papers in this issue of the JCI shed new light on these topics.
Late graft failure after kidney 
transplantation
Kidney transplantation is the most com￾mon solid organ transplant procedure car￾ried out in the US; more than 16,000 such
transplants were performed in 2009 (1).
Advances in immunosuppression over the
past 2 decades have drastically reduced the
incidence of acute T cell–mediated rejec￾tion episodes, but have not significantly
improved long-term allograft survival
(2). The actual half-life for a transplanted
kidney from a deceased donor (the most
common source of kidneys for transplan￾tation) is only 8 years (2), and as few as
one-third of kidney allografts obtained
from older donors remain function￾ing 10 years later (3). Allograft dysfunc￾tion can result in the need for a further
transplant and is a strong independent
predictor of recipient cardiovascular
mortality (4). Late graft loss is commonly
caused by chronic allograft nephropa￾thy, characterized by tissue fibrosis and
tubular atrophy (5). Among the factors
known to contribute to its pathogenesis
are uncontrolled alloimmune reactivity
(T cell– and/or antibody-mediated injury),
recurrent primary renal disease, hyper￾tension, diabetes, and drug toxicity. With
regard to the latter, kidney toxicity as a
result of long-term treatment with the
immunosuppressive agents tacrolimus or
cyclosporine is detectable in virtually all
transplanted kidneys (6).
Although research progress hasimproved
our knowledge of the prevalence, clinical
significance, and pathogenesis of chron￾ic kidney allograft injury, research has
not yet influenced therapeutic decision
making to improve outcomes. Currently,
posttransplant care, including immuno￾suppression, is protocol driven. Altera￾tions in drug dosing are made based on
center-derived protocols and physician
experience. Because chronic injury is mul￾tifactorial, a one-size-fits-all approach
is not ideal. To develop individual thera￾peutic approaches tailored to individual
patients, transplant physicians need risk
assessment tools that can discriminate
specific pathogenic mechanisms, prospec￾tively identify those transplant recipients
destined to have excellent graft function,
recognize those recipients at high risk for
graft loss, and ultimately guide specific
changes in therapy. In this issue of the JCI,
3 papers provide new data that move us
closer to these goals (7–9).
An intragraft molecular signature 
can predict graft loss
To assess the risk of future graft loss,
Einecke and colleagues (7) evaluated gene
expression profiles in tissue from 105 kid￾ney graft biopsies that were performed to
determine the cause of allograft dysfunc￾tion and/or proteinuria using microarray
