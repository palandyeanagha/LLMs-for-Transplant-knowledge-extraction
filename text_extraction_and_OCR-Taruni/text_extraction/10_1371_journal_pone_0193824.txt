Abstract
To assess the potential of individual bile acids (IBA) and their profiles as mechanistic bio￾markers of liver injury for humans in real world situations, we interrogated samples col￾lected under minimum controlled conditions (ie subjects were not fasted). Total bile
acids (TBA) have been considered to be biomarkers of liver injury for decades, and more
recently, monitoring of IBA has been proposed for differentiation of variety of etiologies of
liver injury. We established a LC-MS/MS methodology to analyze nine IBA, generated ref￾erence ranges, and examined effects of age, gender, and ethnicity for each IBA. Further￾more, we evaluated the ability of IBA and their profiles to detect hepatic injury in subjects
with a broad range of liver impairments. To date, our study utilized the largest total cohort
of samples (N = 645) that were divided into 2 groups, healthy or liver impaired, to evaluate
IBA as biomarkers. The TBA serum levels in the Asian ethnic group trended higher when
compared to other ethnic groups, and the serum concentrations of IBA, such as glyco￾cholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), chenodeoxycholic acid
(CDCA), and taurochenoxycholic acid (TCDCA) were significantly increased. To our
knowledge, this report is the first to describe ethnic differences in serum concentrations of
IBAs. In patients with hepatic impairments, with the exception of deoxycholic acid (DCA),
the concentrations of IBAs were significantly elevated when compared with healthy sub￾jects. The conjugated bile acids displayed greater differences between healthy subjects
and subjects with hepatic impairments than non-conjugated bile acids. Furthermore, the
subjects with hepatic impairments exhibited distinct profiles (signatures) of IBAs that clus￾tered subjects according the nature of their liver impairments. Although additional studies
are needed, our data suggested that the analysis of IBA has the potential to become useful
for differentiation of various forms of liver injury.

Introduction
Better biomarkers of liver injury are needed to aid in the early detection of liver diseases, as well
as facilitate the development of safer drugs. Over thirty million Americans (one in ten) have
liver disease, which includes over 100 different forms of the disease (www.liverfoundation.org).
This includes thirty thousand individuals diagnosed with primary liver cancer, one of the few
cancers with increasing incidence, as well as the millions diagnosed with hepatitis B and C.
Furthermore, drug induced liver injury is the most frequent cause of market withdrawal for
drugs [1]. The development of new biomarkers is a challenging and lengthy process requiring
extensive data sets that demonstrate their diagnostic utility. It requires validated analytical
assays and thorough evaluation of biomarker performance according to its context of use in
large populations.
The measurement of total bile acids (TBA) is considered a biomarker of liver function and
an indicator of hepatobiliary impairment or disease. TBA measurement corresponds to the
sum of more than 20 individual bile acids (IBA) that are synthetized by the liver, modified by
gut bacteria, and involved in complex enterohepatic circulation. Primary bile acids, cholic acid
(CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), in addition to downstream secondary bile acids
generated by intestinal microflora, make up the majority of the bile acid pool in humans [2].
The bile acid conjugation process results in less toxic and more water-soluble bile acid species
that are capable of protecting against damage from toxic hydrophobic bile acids, which can
cause increased oxidative stress and cell death signaling [3, 4]. Altered serum bile acid profiles
have been reported in rodents with bile duct hyperplasia and ligation [5, 6], also for many
chronic liver diseases including cholestasis, primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty
liver diseases [7–9]. Furthermore, changes in bile acid composition can potentiate hepatotoxic￾ity through pro-inflammatory mechanisms, membrane damage, or cytotoxicity [6, 10, 11].
Therefore, there is considerable interest in IBA as potential biomarkers of liver damage and
disease [12–14]. The fact that individual bile acids have been identified in multiple studies
indicates that they are potentially valuable as biomarkers.
In our study we evaluated the potential of IBA as mechanistic biomarkers of liver injury in
humans, as applicable in real world situations. Serum samples were collected under minimum
controlled conditions (ie subjects were not fasted) and analyzed with a validated LC-MS/MS
method for nine bile acids. Reference ranges were established for each IBA, and the effects of
age, gender and ethnicity on IBA concentrations were evaluated. In addition, we assessed the
potential of IBA profiles (signatures) to differentiate individual liver impairments. Our study
comprised the largest number of samples to date (N = 645) and complemented recent publica￾tions on bile acids in healthy humans. To our knowledge, this study was the first to evaluate
the effect of ethnicity on IBA concentrations.

taurochenodeoxycholic-2,2,3,4,4-d5 acid (TCDCA-d5) were purchased from Toronto Research
Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). HPLC grade methanol, acetonitrile, water and formic acid
were purchased from Honeywell Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Charcoal stripped
serum was purchased from Bioreclamation (Westbury, NY).
Sample collection from human subjects
The study was conducted in the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved
by the local independent ethics committee. Samples were collected from the Pfizer Clinical
Research Unit (CRU), Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development in Groton, and the Univer￾sity of Michigan health care system (UM) under an approved IRB (2000–005). This study was
specifically approved and performed in accordance to the UMHS/Medical School Institutional
Review Board (IRBMED) guidelines and regulations. All subjects (or guardians if minors)
gave written informed consent for their serum to be used in research.
Healthy volunteers/subjects. Samples were defined as healthy based upon normal chem￾istry ranges (ALT, AST, ALP, TBILI, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and crea￾tine kinase) and no significant clinical diagnosis (S3 Table). Subjects whose values for one or
more of the above tests exceeded 2-fold increase of the normal reference range were not classi￾fied as healthy. In addition, any healthy subject who had an ongoing health problem or immu￾nological flare was omitted from the cohort. Most samples were collected from subjects who
were attending routine health examinations and the fasting status for the majority of these was
not documented.
Hepatic injury subjects. Samples were collected from subjects with Clinically Significant
Diseases at the time of admission to the UM Hospital which indicated impaired liver function,
and whom had at one point, elevated AST and ALT values greater than two times normal lev￾els (ALT>70 U/L; AST>60 U/L). Hepatic injury subjects were grouped by their primary diag￾nosis type, including, Liver Transplant, Hepatic Carcinoma, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD),
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), Cirrhosis and Liver Injury (hepatitis B or C, ethanol cirrhosis,
drug abuse, or transaminitis/hepatic congestion), Pulmonary Diseases and Acetaminophen
(APAP) Toxicity (S4 Table).
Serum samples were recovered from serum-separator tubes following centrifugation of
whole blood at 3000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The routine clinical chemistry panel,
including ALT, AST, and total bile acids, was measured on the Siemens ADVIA 2400 platform
using commercially available kits. The Cerner HNA Millennium Laboratory Information Sys￾tem was used to acquire data. Aliquots of serum samples were frozen at -80˚C and stored until
analysis.
Sample preparation for LC-MS/MS analysis
Fifty microliter (50 μL) of each serum sample was placed into an individual well of an Ostra
protein precipitation plate (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) on the top of a 96-well collec￾tion plate. 400 μL of 1% (v/v) of formic acid in acetonitrile was added to each well for protein
precipitation. Deuterated standards of CA, GCA, TCA, CDCA, GCDCA, TCDCA, and DCA
were used as internal standards. 10 μL of a 1 μg/mL working solution of internal standard
mixture was added to each well of the plate, followed by vortex-mixing. After 10 min of centri￾fugation, the Ostra plate was removed and supernatant evaporated to dryness under a steady
stream of N2 at 40˚C. Samples were reconstituted in 100 μL of 50% (v/v) methanol in water
and 1 μL injected onto the LC/MS system.

Calibration and quality control standard preparation
Bile acid standard or internal standard (IS) solutions at concentrations of 1 mg/mL were pre￾pared by dissolving each standard in methanol. These individual standard solutions were com￾bined and diluted to achieve the concentration of 20 μg/mL for a working standard solution or
1 μg/mL for a working IS solution. A ten point calibration standard curve (5 ng/mL to 10,000
ng/mL) was prepared by serially diluting the working standard solution into charcoal stripped
serum. Quality control (QC) standards were prepared in the same manner (20, 200, and 2000
ng/mL) in charcoal stripped serum. Calibration and QC standards then went through the sam￾ple preparation process described above.
Individual bile acid analysis
IBA analysis was performed by LC/MS/MS. The mass spectrometer was a Sciex (Framing￾ham, MA) 5500 QTrap equipped with Turbo Spray ion source, operating in negative ion
mode. This nine bile acid assay was optimized from the previous 3 bile acid method [5] by
using a longer column (100 x 2.1mm) at a lower flow rate of 300 μL/min. Mobile phase A
was 0.05% (v/v) formic acid in water and mobile phase B was 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in metha￾nol. The gradient program started at 60% B, increased to 90% B in 9 min, decreased to 60% B
in 0.1 min, and then held at 60% B for 0.9 min. The mass spectrometer was operated with the
source and desolvation temperatures set at 120 and 350˚C, respectively. The curtain gas was
40 psi; the ion spray voltage was 4500 V; probe temperature was 600˚C; and ion source gas 1
and ion source gas 2 were 40 psi and 30 psi, respectively. Peak integration and quantification
was performed using Analyst 1.6.2 software. Individual standard curves for each bile acid
were constructed by plotting the ratio of the bile acid peak area to its deuterated standard
peak area versus concentration. Slope and y-intercept were calculated using a linear curve fit
with 1/x2 weighting. The concentrations of bile acids in study samples were calculated rela￾tive to the regression line.
Freshly prepared standard curves and QC samples were included in each analysis run. A
run was deemed acceptable if the QC samples were ±30% of the nominal concentrations and
the coefficient of variance (CV) did not exceed 20%.
Method assessment
The method performance was assessed using QC samples at three concentration levels (20,
200, and 2000 ng/mL) from the calibration curve. Four replicates of each QC sample were ana￾lyzed each day to determine the intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision. This process was
repeated three times over three days in order to determine the inter-day accuracy and preci￾sion using freshly prepared calibration curves. Accuracy and precision were calculated from
the % Relative Error (RE) [% (measured-theoretical)/theoretical concentration] and relative
standard deviation [%RSD = % standard deviation/mean], respectively. The assay recovery
was evaluated by comparing the mean detector response of extracted QC samples at low,
medium, and high concentrations (20, 200, and 1000 ng/mL) in four replicates to those of
post-extracted serum blanks spiked at equal concentrations. The matrix effect was estimated
by comparing the extracted serum residue and the neat solution.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as individuals or group mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statisti￾cal analyses were conducted by two-tailed Student t-test to compare the two groups, such as,
between healthy groups and patients with liver impairments. Values significantly different are

indicated as p<0.01, and p<0.05. To examine the predictability of liver injury by the bile
acid concentrations, the receiver operating characteristic [6] curve analysis was conducted.
The area under ROC curve was used as an overall assessment of a marker’s predictive ability.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the bile acid concentrations to find a
linear combination of the bile acids to account for the maximum variance contained in the
original dataset. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) on the bile acid concentrations was
conducted to study the correlation between diagnosis groups and the hierarchical clusters.
Both PCA and HCA used the transformed data on the logarithmic scale. The analyses were
conducted in statistical software packages SAS and JMP.
Results
Performance of LC-MS/MS analysis of IBA in human serum
The LC-MS/MS assay developed was able to quantitate a set of 9 IBA: CA, GCA, TCA, CDCA,
GCDCA, TCDCA, DCA, GDCA, and TDCA. All IBA had a linear response over a range of 5
to 10,000 ng/mL, with a coefficient of determination (R2
) above 0.99. The lower quantitation
limit for these bile acids was 5 ng/mL. Mean intra-day accuracy was 95–110% for the 9 IBAs,
with a mean CV of 1–8%; Mean inter-day accuracy was 91–112%, with a mean CV of 3–13%
(S1 Table). The mean recovery for the extraction procedures was 98%-131%. The assay perfor￾mance was deemed acceptable, and the method was determined to be suitably accurate and
precise for these analytes.
Characterization of bile acids in healthy human subjects
To establish reference ranges for 9 IBA using LC/MS in healthy subjects, serum samples were
collected from a total 314 subjects, of which 27 were from healthy subjects participating in clin￾ical trials, 34 healthy volunteers from Pfizer Groton campus, and 253 were from healthy sub￾jects at UM (Table 1). The liver health status of subjects from clinical trials was determined
based on physical examination and the status of subjects from UM was determined by medical
adjudication based on evaluation of clinical chemistry and medical records.
In these healthy subjects, non-conjugated forms of IBA and glycine-conjugated BAs were
highly abundant in human serum, with GCDCA found to be the most abundant bile acid
(Table 1). The mean concentrations of serum IBA in healthy subjects did not show statistically
significant differences among the three age groups (less than 40 years of age, 40–60 years of
age and over 60 years of age). The absolute concentrations of the 9 IBA and total bile acids
appeared slightly higher in females than in males (S2 Table). The only statistically significant
difference observed between genders was the mean DCA concentration in females (p <0.03)
as compared to males and more prominently in the 60 and above (p<0.01) group. Upon exam￾ination of the overall IBA profiles, which was performed by determining the percentage for
each IBA concentration of the sum of all measured IBA, healthy males and females were
similar.
When comparing IBA concentrations of healthy subjects across ethnic groups, subjects of
Asian origin demonstrated significant differences in four IBA (Fig 1). Although the mean TBA
concentration in Asians (6.6±1.9 μmol/L) trended higher than Caucasians (4.2±0.3 μmol/L),
the difference was not statistically significant and the mean value was under the generally
accepted upper level of normal for healthy subjects (10 μmol/L). However, upon evaluation of
IBA, serum concentrations of GCA, GCDCA, CDCA and TCDCA were found to be statisti￾cally significantly higher (p<0.01) in Asians as compared to Caucasians.

IBA in subjects with hepatic impairments
To evaluate the effect of liver injury on serum bile acids we examined 331 samples from
patients with a broad range of liver impairments. Overall, as expected, serum TBA concentra￾tions were significantly higher in patients with liver impairments than healthy subjects
(p<0.01) (Table 2). When comparing IBA concentrations in healthy subjects and subjects with
liver impairments, as expected, the concentrations of IBA were also significantly higher, with
the exception of DCA. Furthermore, difference in IBA concentrations between healthy sub￾jects and subjects with liver impairments was larger for conjugated bile acids than for unconju￾gated bile acids. For instance, CA was 3.1-fold higher in subjects with liver impairments,
whereas its taurine conjugated form, TCA showed a 97.2-fold elevation. When comparing
serum IBA concentrations across age groups, genders and ethnicity for the liver impaired sub￾jects, no significant difference was observed among the different age groups, as well as for the
healthy cohort. However, all 9 IBA were slightly higher in females (n = 145), when compared
with males (n = 186) (S1 Fig). Means of IBA in Asians were higher than those in other ethnici￾ties, with slightly larger variability, which may due to the relatively smaller sample size (n = 5).
No statistical significance was observed among other ethnicities (S2 Fig).

To assess the potential of IBA to differentiate subjects with liver impairments from healthy
subjects, we performed a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. This analysis
evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of each IBA to detect liver injury (Fig 2). To define liver
injury we used a clinical chemistry based criterion developed by an international working
group for DILI [15]. This criterion consists of Hy’s Law (3x ALT and 2x TBil), which is
used to identify severe cases of liver injury; the hepatocellular damage is detected by increases
of alanine aminotransferase (5x ALT) and hepatobiliary damage by increases of alkaline
phosphatase (2xALP). TCA had the highest diagnostic power with an area under the curve
of 0.919, followed by GCA (AUC 0.882), total BAs (AUC 0.880), and TCDCA (AUC 0.874).
CA exhibited the least diagnostic power with an AUC of 0.534.
To assess whether IBA analysis might provide additional advantage in detection of liver
injury in humans, the profiles of measured IBA in serum of healthy subjects and subjects with
liver impairments were compared (Fig 3). As outlined previously, profiles were determined
using the percentage for each IBA concentration of the sum of all IBA measured. In compari￾son to healthy subjects, subjects with hepatic impairments exhibited distinct bile acid profiles
(Fig 3). TCA accounted for 3% of the 9 bile acids measured in healthy volunteers, yet in
patients with liver impairments TCA accounted for 16% of the measured bile acid species. On
the other hand, DCA accounted for 12% of the 9 measured bile acids in the healthy population,
while only 0.3% in the patients with liver impairments. Interestingly, the relative proportions
of GCDCA, the most abundant bile acid species in human serum, were indistinguishable
between the healthy and hepatic impairment populations (34% versus 32%). Overall, a greater
percentage of CA and its conjugates (TCA and GCA) was observed in healthy subjects (43%)
than subjects with liver impairments (20%). In contrast, a lower percentage of secondary bile
acids (DCA, GDCA, and TDCA) was found in healthy subjects (33%) than in subjects with
liver impairments (5%). Four of the conjugated bile acids (GCA, GCDCA, TCA, and TCDCA)
accounted for 93% of the 9 bile acids in subjects with liver impairments, while in healthy sub￾jects they accounted only for 55%. Since the cohort of subjects with liver impairments con￾sisted of mainly subjects with liver diseases, we examined whether the IBA profile was similar
for cases of acute drug induced liver injury. When comparing APAP overdosed patients with
all other hepatic injury subjects, only slight differences were observed in the IBA profiles of

slightly smaller proportion of tauro-conjugates (Fig 3).
Bile acid patterns associated with different liver impairments
To examine whether IBA analysis could differentiate subjects based on the etiology of liver
impairments and/or provide mechanistic insights, we evaluated the patterns of serum bile
acids in healthy subjects vs subjects of different impairments using cluster analysis (Fig 4).
Subjects with liver impairments were assigned to groups based on primary diagnosis (a) liver
transplant within the last 3 years, (b) hepatic carcinoma (diagnosed by biopsy or resection), (c)
coronary artery disease (CAD)- coronary heart disease (CHD), cirrhosis and liver injury (Hep￾atitis B or C, hepatic graft vs. host disease, ethanol cirrhosis, etc), pulmonary (Influenza A,
H1N1 Influenza, acute respiratory distress syndrome), and acetaminophen toxicity (APAP￾induced liver failure).
As shown in Fig 4, Tables 3 and 4, Clusters 1 and 2 contained 310 subjects and featured rel￾atively low concentrations of TCA, GCA, TCDCA, and GCDCA. Clusters 1 and 2 included
predominantly healthy subjects (87%). In contrast, clusters 6 and 7, comprising of 114 subjects,

featured relatively high concentrations of TCA, GCA, TCDCA, and GCDCA and included the
majority of subjects with cirrhosis (67.1%), APAP overdose (61.6%), and a substantial portion
of subjects with liver transplant (48.1%). The high values of DCA and its conjugates (TDCA
and GDCA) in cluster 4 were associated with subjects diagnosed with cardiac and heart dis￾eases along with liver impairments.
Discussion
In this study, we utilized a LC-MS/MS assay to measure nine bile acids in a large cohort of
healthy human subjects and subjects with liver impairments to evaluate their potential as bio￾markers. Since BA synthesis, metabolism and excretion are affected by liver diseases, IBAs and
their profiles have been studied as both diagnostic and prognostic markers [16]. Even through
there are many bile acid species in humans, CA, CDCA, DCA and their glycine and taurine
conjugates represent 95%-99% of the bile acid pool in systemic circulation upon liver injury,
and are the only bile acids that accumulate to micro molar concentrations in serum [8, 17, 18].
Therefore, the focus of this investigation was on these nine bile acids. Our objective was to
evaluate the performance of IBA as biomarkers of liver injury in a real world setting, thus the
pre-analytical (sample collection) requirements for sampling was minimal, so, for example,
fasting was not necessary. Compared with previous publications that utilized more strict

IBA as biomarkers for hepatic injury

controls, such as limited food and alcohol intake, the data reported in this study represents a
real-world approach, utilizing subjects with significant life events (impaired liver function),
thus providing insight into the robustness of IBAs as potential biomarkers for liver injury and
diseases. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends using at least
120 samples for establishing reference ranges in healthy individuals (ref document C28 A3).
The samples analyzed consisted of 314 total samples from healthy human subjects, the largest
population reported to date. In general, the mean concentrations of each IBA in this study
were higher than those reported from fasted, healthy subjects [19–23]. For example, the mean
value of the most abundant bile acid in humans, serum GCDCA, was reported as 745 ± 54.2
nM from 150 fasted healthy volunteers [23], whereas in our study was determined it to be
1,297 ± 144 nM including both fasted and non-fasted individuals. This difference observed is
most likely due to the fact that bile acids are typically elevated in non-fasted individuals [21].
However, Scherer et al [24] reported serum GCDCA levels of 1,710 nM from 29 fasted healthy
subjects, suggesting that the differences observed could be a reflection of biological variance or
assay platform variability. Bathena et al. reported that factors, such as food and drink, had sig￾nificant impact on the absolute bile acid concentrations, yet the relative proportions of bile
acid species were only slightly affected [19]. The Mayo Clinic reported reference values for sev￾eral bile acids with their LC/MS-MS method [25]. In the Mayo study, total cholic acid concen￾trations (CA+TCA+GCA) and total chenodeoxycholic acids concentrations (CDCA +TCDCA
+GCDCA) were 5μM and 6μM, respectively. Those findings were in line with our data,
which were 0.7μM and 1.8μM, respectively. Considering differences in analytical methodolo￾gies and pre-analytical conditions, the IBAs concentrations observed in our study were in line
overall with other IBA analyses in healthy human subjects.
To further characterize IBA in healthy human subjects, we evaluated the impact of gender,
age, and ethnicity on the serum IBA concentrations. We did not find significant differences in
IBA concentrations among age groups, which was consistent with previous studies for both
individual and total bile acids [26–29]. Furthermore, in work by Bathena et al, no significant
effect of age was seen on either serum or the urinary BA profiles by using BA indices that
described composition, sulfation and amidation of total and individual BAs, instead of abso￾lute BA concentrations [30]. The data assessment for any gender effect on IBA concentrations
was consistent with previous studies by Kawasaki 1986 and Praneeth 2014, suggesting that no
significant sex-related differences exist for serum bile acids in all age groups for humans [19,
31]. However, our study demonstrated significant differences in IBA concentration among
ethnic groups, with subjects of Asian descent displaying significantly higher concentrations of
CDCA, TCDCA, GCDCA and GCA than subjects of other ethnic backgrounds. To our best
knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating ethnic differences in serum IBAs. Costarelli
et al. reported fecal concentrations of TBA were significantly higher in Asian vegetarians than
Caucasian vegetarians [32]. These different bile acid concentrations may be due to genetic dif￾ferences in bile acid synthesis/metabolism or possibly different dietary patterns. This differ￾ence may also be related to the fact that Asians are more susceptible to certain liver diseases.
Further research is needed to understand these differences and their significance.
Increases observed for both total and some individual bile acid concentrations in subjects
with liver impairments as compared with healthy subjects were consistent with other reports
[17, 33, 34]. Trottier reported an increased ratio of tauro to glyco-conjugates in patients with
primary biliary cirrhosis [8]. Our results also demonstrated that the ratio of tauro-conjugates
to glyco-conjugates was increased in the hepatic injury patients (from 0.16 to 0.59, Table 2)
suggesting that tauro-conjugates could be relatively more sensitive markers in liver injury.
This is supported by the ROC analysis indicating that TCA had the strongest diagnostic power
of all the bile acids analyzed here in Fig 2 [35].

In this work, significantly lower concentrations of DCA were observed in subjects with
liver impairments when compared with healthy subjects. Recently, DCA was reported as sig￾nificantly reduced in patients with biliary tract disease [16]. Similar results reported in other
studies, where a marked increase in the proportions of primary BAs and a decrease in the pro￾portions of secondary BA, such as DCA, were observed in patients with cholestatic liver dis￾eases [8, 23, 34, 36]. This may imply that there is a significant impairment of dehydroxylation
of secondary BAs in patients with primary liver diseases, since secondary BAs are formed
through an enzymatic dihydroxylation of primary BAs catalyzed by bacterial enzymes in the
intestine. Lake et al. also reported that there were elevated taurine-conjugated BAs and
decreased concentrations of CA and GDCA in the livers from patients with non-alcoholic stea￾tohepatitis, and revealed that a potential shift toward the alternative pathway of BA synthesis
based on a transcriptomic analysis of 70 BAs [37]. The unconjugated BA, CA, CDCA, and
DCA, are more hydrophobic, and thus more cytotoxic, with DCA being one of the most toxic/
cytotoxic species. Accumulation of these hydrophobic BAs could result in mitochondrial dam￾age, disruption of cell membranes and production of ROS in hepatocytes, ultimately leading to
apoptosis and necrosis [38–41]. Changes in BA composition are known to lead to altered
hydrophobicity of total BAs, which subsequently yield a decrease in the hydrophobicity index
in liver injury patients. A reduction of hydrophobicity suggests that these patients may present
a less toxic BA pool, when compared to healthy subjects. While the predominant hypothesis in
the field of cholestatic liver injury is that the accumulation of bile acids in serum and liver
directly causes cell death, recent work has cast some doubt on this hypothesis [42]. Our obser￾vations were in line with previous reports in that the unconjugated BA pool did not become
elevated [23, 34, 43, 44]. These data support the premise that changes in IBAs are an indicator
of liver injury and dysfunction, but not a direct cause of cell death.
In our study, subjects with accidental overdoses of APAP provided the only cases of drug
induced liver injury known in the sample pool. Interestingly, these subjects had higher mean
serum concentrations of the unconjugated bile acids CA and CDCA as compared with healthy
subjects and the entire population of subjects with liver impairment (Table 2). This observa￾tion was consistent with our findings in a rodent model that demonstrated a significant
increase in serum levels of CA in conjunction with APAP-induced hepatocyte damage [5],
indicating the potential for translatability from animal species to humans. Significant increases
were also observed for GCA and TCA in rats administered APAP when compared to controls;
the mean values for these BA were also observed to be higher in APAP overdose subjects as
compared with healthy subjects, further demonstrating the potential for translation. GDCA
concentration in DILI group was also much higher than other liver diseases. Woolbright et al.
recently reported that GDCA was significantly increased in APAP induced, non-surviving
acute liver failure and suggested that GDCA may serve as a prognostic biomarker [18]. This
point is supported by our data, even with a small population size (n = 13).
Most researchers have looked at individual bile acids from the perspective of individual
concentrations or patterns. We have illustrated that even though significant differences can be
observed in Asians when compared to Caucasians, the overall composition profile in healthy
Asians matches that of healthy Caucasians. The composition profiles may be the key to teasing
out the questions regarding individual bile acids as biomarkers. The composition profile of the
liver impaired group did look different from healthy individuals, demonstrating that signifi￾cant compositional changes were related to liver impairment and not ethnicity. This method
of data illustration may provide a more powerful analysis going forward for investigations of
bile acids as biomarkers.
One of the main goals of this study was to investigate the relationship between the etiologies
of liver diseases and BA patterns. In our study, the concentrations of BAs conjugated with

taurine and glycine were elevated in patients with different types of liver diseases compared to
healthy volunteers. Thus, elevation of the concentrations of taurine- and glycine conjugates
may not be specific to a single type of liver injury. However, cluster analysis revealed that the
high values of conjugated primary BAs, including TCA, GCA, TCDCA, and GCDCA, were
associated with primary liver diseases, such as APAP overdose, liver transplant and chronic
liver injury. The sustained increase in these conjugated BAs suggested that specific BAs may
serve as novel biomarkers for liver injury or liver dysfunction that could differentiate a variety
of liver injury etiologies. On the other hand, the high concentrations of secondary bile acid
DCA and its conjugates were associated with the clusters of subjects with liver impairment
that also had been diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases. BA are known to play a role in
modulating cardiovascular function [45] and these patterns may provide insight in these roles.
Therefore, these data provide evidence that different BA patterns are linked to various diseases
and have the potential to serve as biomarkers. Further work is needed to understand this com￾plicated relationship.
Conclusions
This study provided normal serum reference ranges for 9 individual bile acids in a large popu￾lation of human subjects with no consideration to diet, alcohol, smoking, or other factors.
Significant differences for bile acid concentrations were demonstrated for subjects of Asian
ethnicity and differences were observed for subjects with liver impairment. We showed that
defining normal serum concentration ranges alone for individual bile acids may not be as use￾ful as defining normal profiles to remove confounding factors, such as ethnicity. This data
demonstrated the ability to separate out disease populations based on their bile acid patterns.
The utility of combining the bile acid profiles with the analysis of bile acid patterns has the
potential for differential diagnosis of liver diseases and provide a better path forward for the
evaluation of individual bile acids as biomarkers.
