Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are acid-fast bacteria that are ubiquitous in the envi￾ronment and can colonize soil, dust particles, water sources, and food supplies. They are
divided into rapidly growing mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobac￾terium chelonae, and Mycobacterium abscessus as well as slowly growing species such
as Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium marinum. About
160 different species, which can cause community acquired and health care-associated
infections, have been identified. NTM are becoming increasingly recognized in recipients
of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with incidence rates ranging between
0.4 and 10%. These infections are 50–600 times commoner in transplant recipients than
in the general population and the time of onset ranges from day 31 to day 1055 post￾transplant. They have been reported following various forms of HSCT. Several risk factors
predispose to NTM infections in recipients of stem cell transplantation and these are
related to the underlying medical condition and its treatment, the pre-transplant condi￾tioning therapies as well as the transplant procedure and its complications. Clinically, NTM
may present with: unexplained fever, lymphadenopathy, osteomyelitis, soft tissue and skin
infections, central venous catheter infections, bacteremia, lung, and gastrointestinal tract
involvement. However, disseminated infections are commonly encountered in severely
immunocompromised individuals and bloodstream infections are almost always associ￾ated with catheter-related infections. It is usually difficult to differentiate colonization from
true infection, thus, the threshold for starting therapy remains undetermined. Respiratory
specimens such as sputum, pleural fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage in addition to cultures
of blood, bone, skin, and soft tissues are essential diagnostically. Susceptibility testing of
mycobacterial isolates is a basic component of optimal care. Currently, there are no guide￾lines for the treatment of NTM infections in recipients of stem cell transplantation, but such
infections have been successfully treated with surgical debridement, removal of infected
or colonized indwelling intravascular devices, and administration of various combinations
of antimicrobials. Monotherapy can be associated with development of drug resistance
due to new genetic mutation.The accepted duration of treatment is 9 months in allogeneic
stem cell transplantation and 6 months in autologous setting. Unfortunately, eradication of
NTM infections may be impossible and their treatment is often complicated by adverse
effects and interactions with other transplant-related medication.

INTRODUCTION
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environ￾mental organisms that have generally been considered as an
uncommon cause of human disease. Before the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, most cases presented as
indolent, cavitating pulmonary infections in individuals with
underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive airway dis￾ease (COPD) or previous tuberculosis (1). During the 1980s,
pulmonary and disseminated infections due to the more common
NTM such as Mycobacterium avium (M. avium), M. intracellu￾lare, M. scrofulaceum emerged as complications of AIDS and were
termed as M. avium complex (MAC) infections (1).
The frequent isolation of NTM other than MAC from solid
organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplan￾tation (HSCT) recipients limits the extrapolation of therapeutic
data from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected indi￾viduals to the population of transplant recipients (1). The spec￾trum of mycobacterial infections associated with SOT and HSCT

Al-Anazi et al. NTM infections in HSCT recipients
differs from that associated with AIDS. Mycobacterial infections
in transplant recipients tend to be more tissue-invasive (1).
MICROBIOLOGY
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are aerobic, non-motile organ￾isms that appear positive with acid-fast alcohol stains. The thick
lipid-rich hydrophobic cell wall renders them impermeable to
hydrophilic nutrients and resistant to heavy metals, disinfectants,
and antibiotics (2). They form biofilms that contribute further to
resistance to disinfectants and antibiotic therapy (2). Host factors
organism characteristics and interferon-γ trafficking influence
susceptibility and manifestations of NTM infection (2, 3). Path￾ogenic NTM are usually less virulent than M. tuberculosis. NTM
may be isolated without having evidence of disease, but species
of NTM that are usually considered contaminants may produce
disease in immunocompromised individuals (3).
PATHOGENESIS
The mode of transmission of NTM to humans is not well defined
(2, 3). Aerosolization of small droplets is the likely route of acquisi￾tion of pulmonary disease. Contamination of hospital water sup￾plies, medical equipment such as bronchoscopes and endoscopes
and contamination of dialysis solutions has led to both NTM col￾onization and health care-associated outbreaks of infection (2).
Environmental exposure plays a major role in transmission of
NTM in immunocompromised hosts (3).
ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES OF NTM
Environmental sources of NTM include tap water, shower heads,
soil and dust, food products in addition to domestic and wild
animals. NTM are a miscellaneous collection of acid-fast bacilli
(AFB) that are widely spread in the environment (2, 4–6). More
than 160 NTM species have been identified, but not all of them
cause human disease (2, 6, 7).
CLASSIFICATION OF NTM SPECIES
Historically, different classification systems have been proposed
including (1) atypical mycobacteria, (2) mycobacteria other than
tuberculosis, and (3) NTM. The last classification (NTM) is the
currently used one and NTM species are usually classified into
slowly growing or rapidly growing NTM (2, 3).
Rapidly growing NTM include M. fortuitum, M. chelonae,
M. abscessus, M. neoaurum, M. flavescens, M. mucogenicum, and
other species (2, 6–9). They grow within 7 days and they have
been associated with infections in SOT recipients more than
in HSCT patients (6, 10). They may be susceptible to the
following antimicrobials: (1) macrolides such as azithromycin
and clarithromycin, (2) aminoglycosides such as amikacin and
tobramycin, (3) tetracyclines such as doxycycline and monocy￾cline, (4) fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin,
(5) linezolid, (6) tigecycline, (7) imipenem, (8) cefoxitin, and (9)
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMZ) (3, 8, 9).
Slowly growing NTM require several weeks to grow and they
include MAC, M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. ulcerans, M. xenopi,
M. simiae, M. szulgi, M. genavense, M. gordonae, M. haemophilum,
and M. malmoense in addition to many other species (2, 6,
7). MAC complex includes M avium, M. intracellulare, M. sil￾vaticum, M. hominissius, M. paratuberculosis, and many others
(2). MAC is a common cause of pulmonary and disseminated
NTM infections (2, 10). M. kansasii is the second most com￾mon cause of pulmonary infections caused by NTM in United
States of America (USA) and England, the commonest being
MAC (2). Slowly growing NTM may be susceptible to the fol￾lowing antimicrobials: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin and rifabutin,
ethambutol, aminoglycosides such as amikacin and streptomycin,
macrolides such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, quinolones, and
sulfamethoxazole (3).
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANCE OF ISOLATION OF NTM
Over the past three decades, the global prevalence of pulmonary
NTM disease has increased dramatically (11). In North America,
the rates of pulmonary NTM disease and infection range from 1
to 15 per 100,000 and 0.1 to 2 per 100,000 population, respec￾tively. In Europe, the incidence rates are generally similar to those
in North America, with the exception of high rates in mining com￾munities in the Czech Republic (12). Epidemiological evaluation
of NTM infection is more challenging than that of tuberculosis due
to the following reasons: (1) lack of systemic reporting of NTM
infections in most countries, (2) NTM disease rates vary consid￾erably depending on the population and the geographic location,
(3) as NTM are soil and water organisms, infection is thought to
be acquired from environment rather than transmitted from per￾son to person, and (4) colonization of respiratory tract can occur
without causing pulmonary tuberculosis (11, 12). Only 6–25% of
NTM isolates obtained from various clinical specimens have been
considered clinically significant according to three major studies
performed in the USA, Switzerland, and South Korea (13–15). In
the absence of mandatory reporting of infections, the true inci￾dence of NTM disease in transplant recipients and in the general
population can be only estimated (1). The epidemiology of NTM
infections in patients without AIDS remains somewhat difficult
to be determined as clinically significant colonization can be dif￾ficult to be distinguished from true infection (16). Although the
isolation of NTM from clinical specimens has recently increased,
laboratory-based surveillance can produce reasonable estimates of
the real incidence of NTM disease (16). Therefore, large multicen￾ter regional studies and mandatory reporting will be required to
better understand the changing epidemiology of NTM infections
in patients without AIDS (16).
RISK FACTORS FOR NTM INFECTIONS
Risk factors for NTM infections in the general population are very
variable and they are listed in Table 1 (5–9, 17–32).
HIGH-RISK GROUPS FOR NTM INFECTIONS
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections are increasingly
reported in SOT and HSCT recipients. Causes of increased inci￾dence of NTM infections in transplant recipients include increase
in the number of transplants done worldwide, intensification of
immunosuppressive therapies, prolonged survival of transplant
patients, and improvements in diagnostic techniques (1). Treat￾ment of NTM infections in transplant recipients comprises reduc￾tion in immunosuppressive therapy, antimicrobials, and surgical
debridement, if needed (33–37).
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections have been reported
in patients with hematological malignancy and in those with solid

population.
(1) Advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection
(2) Presence of comorbid medical conditions such as
**Cystic fibrosis
**Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
**Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis
**Rheumatoid arthritis
**Previous pulmonary tuberculosis infection
(3) Congenital disorders including specific deficiencies and genetic
mutations such as
**Interferon-γ receptor 1 and 2 deficiencies
**Interleukin-12 deficiency
**Signal transduction and activator of transcription-1 deficiency
**Interferon regulator factor 8 deficiency
**GATA-2 (mono-MAC syndrome) deficiency
**Nuclear factor kappa-β essential modulator deficiency
(4) Old age
(5) Male sex
(6) Warm climate
(7) Solid tumors and hematologic malignancy
(8) Cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy administered to control
malignancy
(9) Immunosuppressive therapies including alemtuzumab, rituximab, and
infliximab
(10) Solid organ and stem cell transplantation
(11) Intravascular indwelling catheters, particularly in immunocompromised
individuals
(12) Neutropenia
tumors. The risk factors for NTM infections in cancer patients
include (1) the primary disorder, (2) cytotoxic chemotherapy, (3)
the recent use of monoclonal antibodies and targeted therapies
such as rituximab and alemtuzumab, and (4) HSCT in patients
with hematological malignancy (17–19, 21, 28). In such patients,
antimicrobial treatment can be administered without necessarily
compromising cancer therapy (17). Surgical treatment may be in
the form of surgical resection of a lung segment having a cavity
or debridement of an infected CVC tunnel or a deep seated soft
tissue infection (17–19, 21).
CLINICAL ASPECTS OF NTM INFECTIONS
Infections caused by NTM may present with (1) lymphadenopa￾thy, (2) skin and soft tissue infections, (3) pulmonary disease,
particularly in patients with underlying lung disease, or (4) dis￾seminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised individ￾uals (2, 5–7). Clinical manifestations and complications of NTM
infections vary according to the species isolated and the site of
involvement and they include fever, weight loss, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dyspnea, productive cough, chest pain, lymphadenopa￾thy, hepatosplenomegaly, and infections involving CVCs, skin and
soft tissues, genital tract, and central nervous system (6, 18, 37,
38). At times, NTM infections may be entirely asymptomatic (18,
37, 38).
DISSEMINATED NTM INFECTIONS
Disseminated NTM infections occur almost exclusively in
immunocompromised hosts (6, 7, 18, 19). MAC is the most com￾mon NTM species associated with disseminated infections (6, 18,
19). Disseminated NTM infections involve bone marrow, lym￾phoreticular system, gastrointestinal (GTI) tract, lungs, and skin
(6, 18, 19). Clinical manifestations of disseminated NTM infec￾tions include fever, weight loss, sweating, diarrhea, generalized
lymphadenopathy, disseminated skin lesions, diffuse abdominal
tenderness, and hepatosplenomegaly (6).
Laboratory finding in disseminated NTM infections include
(1) normocytic anemia, (2) bacteremia that may be intermittent
or low-grade, and (3) elevated serum levels of lactic dehydro￾genase and alkaline phosphatase (6). The differential diagnosis
of disseminated NTM infections includes (1) disseminated M.
tuberculosis infection, (2) disseminated fungal infections such as
candidiasis or invasive aspergillosis, (3) metastatic malignancy,
(4) actinomycosis, and (5) nocardiosis (6). Disseminated NTM
disease should be suspected in immunocompromised hosts pre￾senting with non-specific clinical manifestations such as fever,
weight loss, and abdominal pain or skin lesions without other
possible explanations (6).
Treatment of disseminated NTM infections is usually under￾taken in consultation with an expert in infectious diseases (6). If
NTM bacteremia is associated with infection of CVC, removal of
the catheter is strongly recommended. Recovery of the immune
system improves survival in patients with disseminated NTM dis￾ease (6). Medical therapy of disseminated NTM infections and
NTM bacteremia includes initial and continuation phases (6). In
the initial phase, antimicrobials are usually given for 1–2 months
or till clinical or radiological improvement is achieved. At least
three drugs to which the NTM species isolated is susceptible
should be administered. Typical regimens include (a) macrolides
such as clarithromycin or azithromycin, (b) ethambutol, and (c)
rifampicin or rifabutin (6). Randomized observational studies in
HIV patients with MAC infections have shown that multidrug
regimens that include macrolides are associated with clinical and
microbiological improvements (6). The addition of rifampicin to
multidrug regimens has been associated with shorter duration of
bacteremia and decreased level of macrolide resistance (6). The
continuation phase starts once the patient has demonstrated clini￾cal improvement. The antimicrobial regimen is usually composed
of two drugs and the total duration of therapy for dissemi￾nated NTM infection or NTM bacteremia is usually 6–12 months
(6). Antimicrobial prophylaxis may prevent disseminated dis￾ease in immunocompromised individuals, but despite treatment,
disseminated NTM infections carry substantial morbidity and
mortality (6).
DIAGNOSIS OF NTM INFECTIONS
Diagnosis of NTM disease in recipients of SOT and HSCT is
usually difficult. To ensure prompt diagnosis and early initiation
www.frontiersin.org November 2014 | Volume 4 | Article 311 | 3

Al-Anazi et al. NTM infections in HSCT recipients
of therapy, a high index of suspicion for NTM disease should
be maintained (1). Definitive diagnosis of NTM disease requires
recovery of NTM species from: blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes,
liver, lung, and other body tissues or fluids such as pleural fluid
(6). However, culture is essential to differentiate NTM from M.
tuberculosis, determine the species of NTM causing infection, and
perform drug susceptibility testing (6).
Diagnostic tests for CVC-related NTM infections include blood
cultures, cultures of swabs taken from exit sites of CVCs, cul￾tures of swabs taken from discharge obtained from infected tun￾nels, and cultures taken from tips of intravascular catheters after
removal (1).
Biopsy material taken from skin, pleural, and lung lesions
should be subjected to histopathological examination, special
stains, and microbiological cultures (1). The American Thoracic
Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America
(IDSA) diagnostic criteria for NTM pulmonary disease include (1)
clinical: presence of clinical manifestations of pulmonary involve￾ment, presence of underlying medical condition such as cancer
or tuberculosis and appropriate exclusion of other diagnoses, (2)
radiological: presence of pulmonary infiltration, nodular lung
lesions, cavity formation or multifocal bronchiectasis on chest
X-ray or high-resolution CAT scan, and (3) bacteriological: ≥2
positive cultures from expectorated sputum or ≥1 positive BAL
or bronchial wash cultures or transbronchial or open lung biopsy
showing histological evidence of granulomatous inflammation or
AFB and positive NTM cultures or biopsy showing mycobacter￾ial histological features and positive cultures for NTM from ≥1
sputum or bronchial washings (3, 39). It is essential to perform
(1) cultures for other bacteria, M. tuberculosis, fungi, and Nocardia
species as similar infections can be caused by these microorgan￾isms in immunocompromised individuals, and (2) susceptibility
testing of the mycobacterial isolates in order to have optimal care
(1). Recommended susceptibility tests for rapidly growing and
slowly growing NTM species are shown in Tables 2 and 3 (2, 3,
39–47).
The use of 16S rRNA sequencing has been introduced for the
identification of mycobacterial species including NTM (48). It
has a number of advantages including marked shortening of the
turnaround time, and identification of mycobacterial strains with
ambiguous biochemical and fatty acid profiles. The recent increase
in the utilization of 16S rRNA sequencing in the identification of
NTM isolates may render its use cost effective (48).
Multiple blood cultures are needed because NTM bacteremia
may be intermittent or low grade (6). Additionally, mycobacter￾ial blood cultures are usually collected in special media, different
from the media used in standard bacterial blood cultures and must
be specifically requested. However, blood cultures may be negative
even in disseminated NTM disease (6).
In the presence of negative blood cultures, tissue biopsies
become essential diagnostically. Such biopsies that are usually
obtained from bone marrow, liver, skin, lungs, and lymph nodes
are needed for histopathology, acid-fast stains and cultures (6).
Histopathological changes in various forms of NTM disease are
shown in Table 4 (49–51). Tissue biopsies demonstrating AFB or
granuloma formation strongly support the diagnosis of dissemi￾nated NTM infection in the presence of negative blood cultures
(6). Tissue biopsies taken from immunocompromised adults with
disseminated NTM infection show 50% of patients have biopsy
findings consistent with mycobacterial granulomas and 20% have
positive AFB smears (6).
The rapid increase in identified NTM species in recent years
reflects not only improved culturing techniques but also more
precise differentiation of species (2). Species differentiation has
improved dramatically with the development of molecular tech￾niques that allow detection of differences in 16S rRNA gene, which
is highly conserved amongst species though slight differences char￾acterize different species (2). More rapid diagnosis of NTM and
faster differentiation from M. tuberculosis can be attributed to the
introduction of BACTEC fluid culture systems and the develop￾ment of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and DNA probe
techniques (5). Also, identification of new NTM species has been
facilitated by (1) high-performance liquid chromatography, (2)
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and (3) restriction fragment
length polymorphism analysis (2).
TREATMENT OF NTM INFECTIONS
Therapeutic regimens are difficult to adhere to because of long
duration of treatment, adverse events and drug interactions with
other drugs that patients require. New therapeutic regimens that
include newer macrolides are more effective than old regimens,
but failure rates are still very high and relapses may occur even
after apparently successful therapy (5). Recommended therapeutic
regimens and antimicrobial agents that are active against rapidly
growing as well as slowly growing NTM species are shown in
Tables 2 and 3 (2, 3, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 52–57). The evolution of
resistance to antimicrobials used in the therapy of NTM infection
is a real concern as drug resistance increases the chances of treat￾ment failure. Mechanisms of drug resistance in NTM are shown
in Table 5 (40, 47).
OTHER ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR NTM
Refractory and disseminated infections caused by slowly growing
and rapidly growing NTM have been reported to be successfully
treated with interferon-γ, interferon α 2b, and rituximab (58–61).
PROGNOSIS OF NTM INFECTIONS
A population-based comparative study performed in USA between
1999 and 2010 showed that the number of deaths from NTM
disease was rising particularly in individuals ≥55 years, women,
white ethnicity and those living in certain locations such as
Louisiana and Hawaii and that the risk factors for mortality
included COPD, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, HIV, and
tobacco use (62). The outcome of NTM infections is gener￾ally good for localized infection and is often poor for dissemi￾nated disease (33–37). Eradication of NTM infection is usually
difficult and recurrent infection with new strains of NTM or
even relapse of infection caused by the original organism is not
uncommon (2).

a wide spectrum of clinical disorders, but its use is lim￾ited by development of opportunistic infections, which carry

significant morbidity and mortality (63). Recipients of HSCT
have severely impaired cell mediated immunity as a consequence
of underlying disease, pre-transplant chemotherapy, and radio￾therapy in addition to graft versus host disease (GVHD) and its
treatment (64).
Distinguishing infection from colonization by NTM such as
MAC can be difficult as infection by microorganisms other than
NTM and as non-infectious conditions, such as GVHD of lungs,
may mimic NTM infections following HSCT (4, 65, 66). Patients
with probable or possible NTM infection usually have differ￾ent epidemiology, risk factors, sites of infection, species of NTM
involved and prognosis from patients having definite infections
(4, 66).
CDC DEFINITIONS OF NTM DISEASE IN ALLOGENEIC HSCT
Recently, centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) has
provided criteria to define NTM infections in recipients of HSCT
as follows:
LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT
Criteria for definite NTM disease include (A) + (B) + (C), i.e.,
having (A) symptomatic patient with radiological evidence of
disease (pneumonic infiltration, nodules, cavity formation, and
bronchiectasis), (B) at least one positive culture of NTM from
lower respiratory tract (BAL or deep tracheal sputum), and (C)
one concomitant blood culture for NTM or histological evidence
of tissue invasion by NTM (4, 66). Criteria for probable NTM

CATHETER-RELATED INFECTIONS
Definite NTM infection is defined as having typical symptoms
such as exit site or tunnel erythema, purulence or fever and a pos￾itive blood culture for NTM. However, probable NTM infection is
defined as having typical symptoms and isolation of NTM from
the catheter site, tunnel, or tip (4, 66).
NTM INFECTION INVOLVING OTHER SITES
Criteria for definite NTM infection include (A) + (B) + (C), i.e.,
having (A) compatible symptoms, (B) a positive culture of NTM
from a usually sterile site, and (C) histological evidence of atyp￾ical mycobacterial tissue invasion or a positive blood culture.
Criteria for probable NTM infection include (A) + (B), i.e., (A)
presence of compatible symptoms, and (B) a positive culture of
NTM from a normally sterile site, but no histological evidence of
atypical mycobacterial tissue invasion or positive blood cultures
(4, 66).
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF NTM INFECTIONS IN HSCT
The incidence of NTM infections in adult recipients of HSCT
ranges between 0.4 and 4.9% (1, 10, 65, 66). However, in allo￾geneic HSCT, this incidence may reach 9.7% (4, 5, 8, 63). NTM
infections are increasingly reported in recipients of HSCT (63).
The incidence of NTM infections in HSCT patients is 50–600 times
greater than in general population (1). In pediatric recipients of
HSCT, the incidence of NTM infections is less frequent than in
adults receiving HSCT. The incidence of NTM infections in chil￾dren receiving HSCT is about 3.8%, but has recently reached 6.4%
in allogeneic setting (63). The recent increase in the incidence of
NTM disease in pediatric recipients of allogeneic HSCT appears
to be associated with the increased use of anti-T-cell antibodies
such as ATG and alemtuzumab (63).
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections in HSCT recipients
occur at a median of 115–1055 days post-HSCT (63, 66, 67).
However, NTM infections have been reported as early as day 7
post-HSCT and have also been reported prior to HSCT (66–68).
The incidence of NTM infections in recipients of HSCT varies
from one transplant center to another (4). In T-cell depleted allo￾grafts, the incidence of NTM infections ranges between 0.37 and
9.7% (4, 66, 68). A combination of host, environmental, nosoco￾mial and historical factors may contribute to the epidemiology of
NTM disease in recipients of HSCT (4).
RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NTM INFECTIONS IN
HSCT
The risk factors for development of NTM infections in recipi￾ents of HSCT are very variable and they are included in Table 6
(4, 26, 64–70). NTM infections have been reported more fre￾quently in recipients of: allografts than in autografts, myeloablative
transplants than in non-myeloablative transplants, and matched
unrelated donor as well as mismatched allografts than in sib￾ling allogeneic transplants (4, 65–71). NTM infections have been
reported in patients receiving conditioning therapies comprising:
total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide, busulphan, ATG, and
alemtuzumab (4, 26, 64–70). NTM infections have been reported
in almost all type of HSCT including: autologous HSCT, sib￾ling allogeneic HSCT, unrelated allografts, umbilical cord blood
transplants, T-cell depleted grafts, and myeloablative as well as
non-myeloablative allogeneic transplants (4, 65–71). With better
M. tuberculosis prophylaxis, intensive immunosuppressive therapy
and better awareness, NTM infections have become an emergent
marker of severe immunosuppression and poor prognosis. When
there is doubt over species identity or extent of infection, broad
spectrum antimicrobial cover may become prudent (65).

NTM SPECIES REPORTED IN HSCT
In recipients of HSCT, the following rapidly growing NTM species
have been reported to cause infections: M. fortuitum, M. abscessus,
M. chelonae, and M. mucogenium (4, 64–68). The following slowly
growing NTM species have also been reported to cause infections
in recipients of various types of HSCT: M. avium and M. intra￾cellulare, M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. gordonae, M. haemophilum,
and M. scrofulaceum (4, 26, 63, 65–72). However, the most fre￾quently isolated NTM species in recipients of HSCT are MAC,
M. haemophilum, M. gordonae, M. fortuitum, M. abscessus, and M.
chelonae (10, 66). NTM species may coexist with other organisms
as causes of infections in recipients of HSCT such as: Aspergillus
fumigatus, Candida albicans, cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial
virus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus (64, 65,
67, 68).
SPECIFIC INFECTIONS CAUSED BY NTM IN RECIPIENTS OF
HSCT
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria species have been reported to
cause a variety of infectious complications in recipients of HSCT.
These infectious complications include CVC-related infections,
pleuropulmonary infections, skin and soft tissue infections, blood￾stream infections, disseminated infections, GIT infections, bone
marrow involvement, bone and joint infections in addition to
involvement of liver and sinuses (4, 63, 65, 68–72).
CVC-RELATED INFECTIONS CAUSED BY NTM IN HSCT
In recipients of HSCT, catheter-related infections are the most
commonly encountered NTM infectious complications followed
by pulmonary and cutaneous infections (1, 5, 8, 10). CVC-related
infections account for 36% of all NTM infections in recipients of
HSCT. These infections are often caused by rapidly growing NTM
species (5). Slowly growing NTM species such as M. gordonae are
a rare cause of CVC-related infections in recipients of HSCT (65).
The median time to diagnosis of CVC-related NTM infec￾tion from HSCT is approximately 61 days (66). The following
NTM species have been reported to cause CVC-related infection
in patients with HSCT: M. fortuitum, M. chelonae, M. absces￾sus, M. mucogenicum, and M. neoaurum (8, 9, 65, 66, 68). The
clinical manifestations and complications of CVC-related NTM
infections include exit site infection, tunnel infection, NTM bac￾teremia, and bloodstream infections in addition to disseminated
disease (8, 9, 65, 66, 68). NTM bloodstream infections in recipients
of HSCT are almost always associated with infections affecting
indwelling intravascular catheters. However, disseminated NTM
infections have been reported up to one year following initial
CVC-related infection (8). Treatment of uncomplicated CVC￾related NTM infections in transplant recipients includes removal
of CVC, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement of soft
tissues surrounding the tunnel of the affected CVC. The fol￾lowing antimicrobials can be used: ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin,
doxycycline, amikacin, meropenem, and linezolid. Antimicrobial
therapy should be guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing
results (8, 9, 66). A combination of two to three antimicrobials
is usually required. Exit site infections can be treated for 3 weeks,
while tunnel infections and NTM bloodstream infections require
antimicrobial therapy for 6 weeks (8, 9, 66).
Complicated CVC-related infections caused by NTM and man￾ifested by disseminated disease or bloodstream infection usually
require (1) combination of antimicrobials depending on the iden￾tified NTM species and susceptibility testing results, (2) initially,
broad and empirical antibiotic therapy can be administered in
severely ill or immunocompromised individuals till identification
and susceptibility results are obtained, then antimicrobial ther￾apy may be narrowed accordingly, and (3) prolonged duration
of therapy is usually required for recipients of HSCT: 6 months
for autologous HSCT and 9 months for allogeneic HSCT (8).
CVC-related NTM infections in HSCT patients usually have good
prognosis, provided CVCs are removed early and appropriate
antimicrobials are given. However, CVC-related infections may
be complicated by disseminated infections despite antimicrobial
treatment in severely immunocompromised hosts (8, 9, 66).
PULMONARY INFECTIONS CAUSED BY NTM IN HSCT
RECIPIENTS
Pleuropulmonary infections in HSCT recipients are usually caused
by slowly growing NTM species with MAC being the most fre￾quently encountered species (5, 66, 69). Pulmonary infections
account for about 30% of all infections caused by NTM in recipi￾ents of HSCT (5, 66). Pulmonary infections can be a complication
of CVC-related NTM infections (8). They can present with lung
nodules or necrotizing pneumonia (8, 69). Chest X-rays and CAT
scans of lungs are essential diagnostically (4, 8, 65–67). Radio￾logical manifestations are variable and they include consolidation
or patchy infiltration, pulmonary nodules that may be multiple,
lung cavitations, multifocal bronchiectasis and pleural effusions
Frontiers in Oncology | Hematology Oncology November 2014 | Volume 4 | Article 311 | 8

Al-Anazi et al. NTM infections in HSCT recipients
(4, 8, 65–67). Cultures of sputum, BAL, pleural biopsy, and lung
biopsy can be used to increase diagnostic yield. In addition,
histopathology of lung biopsies may show granuloma formation
in pulmonary infections caused by NTM in HSCT recipients (65,
66).
The following antibiotics can be given: azithromycin, clar￾ithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin. Additionally, first line
anti-tuberculosis drugs such as INH, ethambutol, rifampicin, and
pyrazinamide can be given (8, 65, 66, 68). Duration of treatment
is as follows: (1) a single agent can be given for 9 months, (2)
a combination of 2 drugs can be given for 4–6 months, and (3)
for complicated NTM infections, particularly in immunocompro￾mised individuals, antimicrobial therapy can be continued for 12
to18 months (8, 65, 66, 68).
SKIN INFECTIONS CAUSED BY NTM IN HSCT RECIPIENTS
Skin infections due to NTM have been reported in recipients of
HSCT. In the absence of appropriate therapy, localized infec￾tions may become disseminated and may even cause regional
and painful lymphadenopathy in immunocompromised HSCT
patients. However, even in the presence of targeted therapy, skin
infections may disseminate (70, 71).
OTHER INFECTIONS CAUSED BY NTM IN HSCT RECIPIENTS
Gastrointestinal involvement has been reported in HSCT patients.
Other infections such as: bone, bone marrow, vertebrae, liver, max￾illary sinus involvement and even lymphadenopathy with necro￾tizing granulomas have been reported in HSCT patients (4, 66,
68, 72). Disseminated NTM infections have also been reported in
recipients of HSCT (66, 70–72).
HSCT IN PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY INFECTED WITH NTM
Having NTM infection prior to transplant is not a contraindi￾cation to successful HSCT, as HSCT has been successfully per￾formed in patients with history of treated NTM infections (24,
73). However, such patients may need to have anti-mycobacterial
prophylaxis against NTM till day 100 post-HSCT (73).
DIAGNOSIS OF NTM INFECTIONS IN HSCT RECIPIENTS
Swabs taken from skin, subcutaneous tissue and nasal wash can be
cultured for NTM. Also, NTM cultures can be taken from blood,
skin lesions, pleural fluid, and BAL fluid. Susceptibility testing
should be performed on positive cultures and biopsies can be
taken from involved sites or organs. Skin biopsies may reveal gran￾ulomas on histology and may show evidence of AFBs (4, 64–66,
68–70). However, DNA hybridization methods may be needed for
identification of NTM species. Biopsy material taken from lung,
liver, bone marrow, and even vertebrae may show histopatholog￾ical appearances consistent with NTM disease. Radiology is also
helpful in diagnosis of NTM infections. Chest X-rays, CAT scans of
chest, abdomen and pelvis may show the extent of NTM infection.
Rates of positive NTM cultures vary from one transplant center or
from one institution to another (4, 64–66, 68–70).
TREATMENT OF NTM INFECTIONS IN RECIPIENTS OF HSCT
Treatment of NTM infections in HSCT patients comprises med￾ical therapy, surgical treatment and additional forms of ther￾apy. Medical therapy is based on antimicrobials that are usually
given in two to four drug combinations (63–66, 68–70). The
following drugs are usually utilized in the treatment of NTM
infections in HSCT recipients: aminoglycosides such as amikacin
and tobramycin, macrolides such as minocycline, TMP–SMZ,
ciprofloxacin, imipenem, linezolid, and tigecycline. Antimicrobial
therapy should be based on results of antimicrobial susceptibility
testing. Duration of therapy is usually variable and depends on
the site and extent of infection as well as the clinical condition of
the patient (63–66, 68–70). Antimicrobial therapy is usually given
for 3 months or even much longer duration particularly in dis￾seminated infections. At times, medical therapy may be prolonged
and repeated cycles of antimicrobial therapy may be required in
recurrent or partially treated infections (63–66, 68–70).
Surgical treatment in the form of debridement may be needed
in severe localized infections such as tunnel infections as well
as serious skin and soft tissue infections (64). However, addi￾tional therapies such as growth factors and non-steroidal anti￾inflammatory drugs may be given to augment immunity of
patients having NTM infections. Nevertheless, such additional
therapies may not be effective (69).
Cessation or tapering of immunosuppressive therapies given to
recipients of allogeneic HSCT, particularly those having GVHD,
may facilitate treatment of NTM infections. However, such
maneuver may also be ineffective (69).
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HSCT THERAPIES AND
ANTIMICROBIALS
Treatment of NTM disease in transplant recipients may be compli￾cated by the possibility of drug interactions between antimicrobial
agents and immunosuppressive therapies and the possibility of
allograft rejection or worsening of GVHD as a result of reduction
in immunosuppression during NTM treatment (1). Drug interac￾tions between immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine-A
and tacrolimus and various antimicrobials given to control NTM
infections are real concerns as they have significant impact not
only on control of the underlying infectious process but also on
the outcome of HSCT (69, 74–76).
Cyclosporine-A is an immunosuppressive agent that is fre￾quently used in allogeneic HSCT to prevent GVHD. It is metab￾olized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) in hepatic system.
Antimicrobials that induce or inhibit CYP enzymes and that are
concurrently administered with cyclosporine-A are likely to alter
blood levels of cyclosporine-A (74). Thus, drugs that increase
blood levels of cyclosporine-A are likely to potentiate its side effects
particularly nephrotoxicity, while antimicrobials that decrease
blood levels of cyclosporine-A are likely to cause graft rejec￾tion (75). Examples of antimicrobials that alter blood levels of
cyclosporine-A include (1) macrolides such as ciprofloxacin, (2)
cephalosporins such as cefepime, (3) azoles such as fluconazole,
and (4) TMP–SMZ (74, 75).
Tacrolimus is being increasingly used as an immunosuppres￾sant agent in recipients of SOT and HSCT. It is metabolized
by CYP 3A4 system, thus, antimicrobials that inhibit or induce
these enzymes can alter blood levels of tacrolimus (76). Antimi￾crobials that increase blood levels of tacrolimus will further
aggravate its nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, while antimicro￾bials, which decrease blood levels of tacrolimus, are likely to

Al-Anazi et al. NTM infections in HSCT recipients
increase the risk of organ or graft rejection (76). The following
antimicrobials that are used in the treatment of NTM infections
have been reported to interact with tacrolimus (1) macrolides such
as clarithromycin and azithromycin, (2) aminoglycosides such as
tobramycin, amikacin, and streptomycin, (3) quinolones such as
ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, (4) anti-mycobacterial agents such as
rifampin, rifabutin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, and (5) other
antimicrobials such as aztreonam, meropenem, sulfonamides, and
tetracyclines (76). Therefore, it is essential to (1) modify doses of
antimicrobials as well as immunosuppressive therapies as needed
and (2) have rigorous monitoring of not only adverse effects but
also drug levels of medications used in HSCT recipients (75).
COURSE AND PROGNOSIS OF NTM INFECTIONS IN HSCT
The course of NTM disease in recipients of HSCT may be pro￾longed, persistent, and may take the form of remissions and exac￾erbations. Significant morbidity and mortality has been reported
particularly in patients having other comorbid medical condi￾tions (26, 64, 69–71). Good outcome is associated with: appro￾priate antimicrobial therapy, CVC-related infections and local￾ized disease while poor prognosis is associated with: inappropri￾ate antimicrobial therapy, delayed initiation of antibiotic treat￾ment, disseminated disease, bloodstream infections, and severe
immunosuppression in the host (63–67, 69–72).
CONCLUSION
Infections caused by NTM are increasingly recognized in immuno￾compromised individuals including patients with cancer and
recipients of SOT as well as HCST. Both slowly growing and
rapidly growing NTM species cause variable infectious compli￾cations in recipients of almost all forms of HSCT. These infections
carry significant morbidity and mortality. Prompt diagnosis and
early initiation of appropriate antimicrobials therapy improve the
outcome of NTM infections in HSCT recipients.
