Despite the established role of alveolar type II epithelial cells for the maintenance of
pulmonary function, little is known about the deregulation of lipid composition in the
pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. The elongation of long-chain fatty acids family member 6
(Elovl6) is a rate-limiting enzyme catalysing the elongation of saturated and mono￾unsaturated fatty acids. Here we show that Elovl6 expression is significantly downregulated
after an intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BLM) and in human lung with idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. Elovl6-deficient (Elovl6  /  ) mice treated with BLM exhibit severe
fibroproliferative response and derangement of fatty acid profile compared with wild-type
mice. Furthermore, Elovl6 knockdown induces a change in fatty acid composition similar to
that in Elovl6  /  mice, resulting in induction of apoptosis, TGF-b1 expression and reactive
oxygen species generation. Our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated role
for Elovl6 in the regulation of lung homeostasis, and in pathogenesis and exacerbation of
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

I
diopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic interstitial
lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and
excessive extracellular matrix deposition, resulting in severe
respiratory insufficiency1,2. Increasing numbers of studies for the
pathogenetic mechanism of IPF demonstrate notable roles of
alveolar epithelial cell injury, which is triggered by various stimuli
including oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and
implies that accumulation of exceeding wound repair leads to a
development of fibrosis3. The role of alveolar epithelial cell
apoptosis during fibrosis has been extensively studied. For
example, Plataki et al.4 showed that the apoptosis promoting
factors, p53, p21, Bax and caspase 3 were upregulated in
bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in lung specimens taken
by biopsy in IPF patients, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotide
transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick
end-labelling) was positive in alveolar epithelial cells of all IPF
patients. Likewise, Kuwano et al.5 demonstrated that caspase
inhibitor protected progression of fibrosis in the rodent
model. Moreover, alveolar epithelial cells produce transforming
growth factor (TGF)-b1, which has a crucial role in lung
fibrinogenesis6–9. Furthermore, the role of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells has been well
appreciated as an initiation step of pulmonary fibrosis. However,
the upstream mechanisms of ROS production and apoptosis in
pulmonary fibrosis are still unclear. Therefore, the research to
determine the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis and
TGF-b production in alveolar epithelial cells may provide novel
potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of IPF.
The integrity of alveolar type II epithelial cells is indispensable
for the maintenance of pulmonary function, partly because these
cells synthesize pulmonary surfactant that is critical for lung
compliance by facilitating the reduction of alveolar surface
tension. Approximately 90% of surfactant consists of saturated
phospholipids, of which phosphatidylcholine is by far the most
abundant component with some triacylglycerols and cholesterol,
and 10% of lung-specific surfactant proteins (SPs), SP-A, SP-B,
SP-C and SP-D10. Surfactant deficiency or disruption of
production of SPs results in alveolar damage11,12. A variety of
mutations in the SP-C gene have been identified in patients with
pulmonary fibrosis13,14. However, there is no evidence to date
indicating that dysregulation of lipids components in alveolar
type II epithelial cells predisposes the lung to injury and
subsequent fibrotic response.
Central to the lipid biosynthesis are the elongation and
desaturation of fatty acids (FAs), which regulate the length and
degree of unsaturation of FAs and thereby determine their
function and metabolic fates. The elongation of long-chain FAs
family member 6 (Elovl6) is a rate-limiting enzyme catalysing the
elongation reaction of palmitate (C16:0) to stearate (C18:0), and
stearate is converted to oleic acid (OA; C18:1n-9) by stearoyl CoA
desaturase (SCD). Palmitate is converted to palmitoleic acid
(C16:1n-7) by SCD, and palmitoleic acid is elongated to vaccenic
acid (C18:1n-7) by Elovl6 or Elovl5 (refs 15–17). Matsuzaka
et al.15 demonstrated that Elovl6-deficient (Elovl6  /  ) mice are
resistant to diet-induced insulin resistance, despite their hepato￾steatosis and obesity being similar to that of the wild-type (WT)
mice. Such a favourable metabolic response to high-fat diet in
Elovl6  /  mice may be largely due to increased ratio of
palmitoleic acid to palmitic acid (PA) in the liver. More recent
study has shown that atherogenic high-fat-diet-induced hepatic
inflammation, oxidative damage and fibrosis in the liver were
attenuated in Elovl6  /  mice, despite comparable hepato￾steatosis in Elovl6  /  and WT mice18. These data suggest that
alteration of FA components in Elovl6  /  mice contribute to
insulin sensitivity independently of obesity, cellular energy
balance and stress. However, the effects of the change in FA
composition in alveolar type II epithelial cells on their own
homeostasis have not been investigated.
In this study, we examine the effects of Elovl6 deficiency on
the fibrotic response after bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury
in vivo, and on apoptosis, TGF-b production and ROS
production in alveolar type II epithelial cells in vitro. Our data
using Elovl6  /  mice provide a new role for Elovl6 by showing
that Elovl6 deficiency promotes BLM-induced lung injury
and makes alveolar type II epithelial cells more susceptible to
oxidative stress.
Results
BLM treatment decreases Elovl6 expression in the lung. To
determine the expression of Elovl6 in the lung, we first carried out
immunohistochemistry on lung tissue from untreated C57BL/6
(WT) control mice using anti-Elovl6 antibody and anti-SP-C
antibody as an alveolar type II epithelial cell marker. As expected,
control tissue show that SP-C is exclusively present in alveolar
type II epithelial cells. Elovl6 staining appears to be similar to SP￾C staining, suggesting that Elovl6 is expressed in alveolar type II
epithelial cells (Fig. 1a). Next, we examined whether Elovl6
expression was affected during fibrotic change induced by intra￾tracheal BLM instillation (1 mg kg  1). Histologic analysis at
21 days after BLM instillation demonstrated increased fibrosis,
especially in peribronchial locations (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, Elovl6
staining was markedly reduced in epithelial cells, while SP-C
staining was moderately reduced. We also measured the Elovl6
and SP-C mRNA expression in the lung from BLM-treated WT
mice by quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR (qRT–PCR).
Elovl6 and SP-C mRNA levels were decreased by 42% and 20%,
respectively, in the lung from BLM-treated mice compared with
saline-treated control mice (Fig. 1b,c). Consistent with the results
of qRT–PCR, elongase activity was decreased in lung of BLM￾treated mice compared with that in WT lung (Fig. 1d). These data
suggest that Elovl6 expression was preferentially downregulated in
the alveolar type II epithelial cells in response to BLM.
Elovl6 expression is downregulated in the lung of patients with
IPF. To address the Elovl6 expression in the lung of IPF patients,
we examined Elovl6 expression using immunohistochemistry on
lung tissues from IPF patients and lung cancer patient. Immuno￾reactivity for Elovl6 localized to alveolar type II epithelial cell
indicated by SP-C immunoreactivity in normal lung area of
cancer patient. In the lung affected by IPF, Elovl6 expression was
markedly decreased compared with SP-C expression (Fig. 1e).
Elovl6  /  knockout exacerbates pulmonary fibrosis by BLM.
To investigate the role of Elovl6 in fibrotic response in the lung,
we compared the histopathology between Elovl6  /  and WT
mice with or without intratracheal instillation of BLM
(1 mg kg  1) for 21 days. Haematoxylin and eosin and Masson’s
trichrome staining revealed a modest but significant increase in
fibrosis area in Elovl6  /  mice compared with WT mice. As
expected, intratracheal instillation of BLM induced prominent
accumulation of collagen and extracellular matrix, thickened
interalveolar septa and obstruction of alveolar space in WT
mice at 21 days, and notably, such a response was markedly
exaggerated in Elovl6  /  mice (Fig. 2a,b). In addition, semi￾quantitative assessment using Ashcroft score demonstrated that
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis was more extensive in the
Elovl6  /  lung than in WT lung (Fig. 2c). These histopatho￾logical changes were associated with increased mortality at
21 days after BLM instillation in Elovl6  /  mice (6 of 28 mice in
Elovl6  /  mice versus 1 of 24 in WT mice). Elovl6  /  mice
weigh less than WT mice both before and 21 days after BLM

administration (WT mice: before BLM, 25.2±1.0 and after BLM
26.3±1.4; Elovl6  /  mice: before BLM, 22.0±1.5 and after
BLM, 21.4±1.8; means±s.d.). Evaluation of collagen synthesis
by sircol assay revealed that soluble collagen synthesis was sig￾nificantly increased in Elovl6  /  mice than in WT mice in
response to BLM instillation (Fig. 2d). Consistent with these
results, the procollagen type I and type III mRNA levels were
robustly increased after BLM instillation in both WT and
Elovl6  /  lungs, and difference between these mice lungs did
not reach statistical significance. Of note, smooth muscle a-actin
gene expression was modestly but significantly elevated in
Elovl6  /  lung compared with WT lung at baseline and after
BLM instillation, implying that lack of the Elovl6 gene per se
promotes lung fibrosis (Fig. 2e). Taken together, these results
suggest that deletion of the Elovl6 gene by itself induces a fibrotic
change in the absence of BLM, and causes the life-threatening
pulmonary fibrosis in response to BLM challenge in mice.
Elovl6 deficiency alters FA composition in vivo. To explore the
mechanisms by which Elovl6 deficiency aggravates pulmonary
fibrosis with and without BLM instillation, we aimed to deter￾mine whether Elovl6 deficiency leads to alteration of FA com￾position in the lung. To this end, we extracted total lipids from
the lung of WT or Elovl6  /  mice and measured FA composi￾tion. As shown in Fig. 2f, relative amounts of C16-saturated FA,
PA (C16:0), was increased, whereas C18 monounsaturated FA
OA (C18:1n–9) was decreased. These results were consistent with
the changes in hepatic FA composition in the chow-fed Elovl6 / 
mice as reported by Matsuzaka et al.15 Interestingly, FA
composition in the lung from untreated Elovl6  /  mice
exhibited similar profiles to that observed in WT mice treated
with BLM, with an increase in PA and a decrease in OA and
linoleic acid (LA) compared with untreated WT. An elevation of
PA and reduction of OA amount was exaggerated in Elovl6  / 
mice lung with BLM administration compared with WT mice,
suggesting the role of Elovl6 as a key regulator of FA composition.
Such a role of Elovl6 is most convincingly demonstrated in
Elovl6  /  mice treated with BLM.
Several elongases and desaturases other than Elovl6 regulate
FA composition. Thus, we measured mRNA expressions of
Elovl5, SCD1, SCD2, SCD3 and SCD4 in WT and Elovl6  / 
lungs, and found that BLM instillation significantly reduced
Elovl5 gene expression in both WT and Elovl6  /  lungs,
whereas its expression was comparable between WT and
Elovl6  /  lungs at baseline (Fig. 2g). The alteration of the
SCD gene expression in response to Elovl6 deletion or BLM
instillation varied depending on SCD isoforms. The mRNA levels
of SCD2 and SCD4, but not SCD1 and SCD3, were decreased in
Elovl6  /  lung at baseline, and BLM instillation significantly
reduced the expression of the SCD2, SCD3 and SCD4. As shown
in Fig. 2f, analyses of the lipid composition of the lung
homogenate revealed that either Elovl6 deletion or BLM
instillation decreased the proportion of C18:1n-9 (OA) as
compared with that in WT lung homogenates. Although the
relative contribution of SCD isoforms to desaturation process in

mice lung remains to be explored, downregulation of Elovl5, as
well as of SCD2 and SCD4, may at least partly explain the
decrease in C18:1n-9 in Elovl6  /  lung and BLM-instilled lung.
Our data showed that LA content was significantly lower in
Elovl6  /  mice than in WT mice, although LA is not a major
substrate for Elovl6. To address the mechanisms of a decrease of
LA content in Elovl6  /  lung, we measured mRNA levels of FA
desaturase (FADS) 1 and 2, which catalyse the desaturation
reaction of n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), including LA19.
Results showed that expression of the FADS1 and FADS2 genes

was significantly reduced both in Elovl6  /  and BLM-treated
mice (Fig. 2g). Next, we examined mRNA expressions of FA
transport proteins (FATP) 1, 3 and 4, which have a role in the
uptake of long-chain FAs20,21. As shown in Fig. 2g, the
expressions of the FATP1, 3 and 4 genes were significantly
reduced in mice treated with BLM, and FATP1 and 3 expressions
were also significantly lower in Elovl6  /  mice. Therefore, the
decrease of LA content in Elovl6  /  mice may be attributed to
the impairment of the uptake of long-chain FAs through the
downregulation of the FATP expressions.
BLM induces apoptosis and TGF-b1 expression in the lung. An
important question is why Elovl6  /  mice manifest pulmonary
fibrosis at baseline and are highly susceptible to BLM compared
with WT mice. One possible explanation is that Elovl6 deletion
per se causes apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells and/or induces
TGF-b1 production in these cells, given that apoptosis and
TGF-b1 production in alveolar epithelial cells largely contributes
to the development of fibrosis4–9. Hence, we compared
fluorescent TUNEL staining and caspase 3 activity between WT
or Elovl6  /  lungs before and after BLM instillation. As shown
in Fig. 3a, representative immunofluorescence images showed
that TUNEL-positive cells were detected in Elovl6  /  mice but
scarcely detected in WT mice before BLM instillation. Double
immunofluorescent staining for TUNEL and SP-C together with
DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining of lung tissues
from WT and Elovl6  /  mice showed the colocalization of
TUNEL-positive and SP-C-positive cells, indicating that TUNEL￾positive cells are indeed alveolar type II epithelial cells (Fig. 3b).
In addition, our data showed clearly that the number of TUNEL￾positive cells was significantly increased in Elovl6  /  mice
compared with WT mice as early as 7 days and after BLM
exposure (Fig. 3c). Moreover, western blot analysis of the lung
homogenates revealed that cleaved-caspase 3 production levels
were more increased in Elovl6  /  mice compared with that in
WT mice, and this effect was pronounced by the administration
of BLM as early as 7 days (Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Fig. S1a)
and 21 days after BLM instillation (Fig. 3f,g).
We next performed qRT–PCR analysis of RNA from the lung
and found that TGF-b1 mRNA levels were increased in Elovl6 /
mice compared with WT mice at baseline, and was strongly
augmented in BLM-treated Elovl6  /  mice at day 7 and day 21
(Fig. 3h). In addition, the protein amount of TGF-b1 as assessed
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Fig. 3i) was
significantly increased in Elovl6  /  lung before and after
treatment with BLM compared with WT lung. These results
were compatible with the results of TGF-b1 mRNA expression.
Together, these results suggest that an induction of both
apoptosis and TGF-b1 production in alveolar type II epithelial
cells is an important mechanism for the exacerbation of BLM￾induced pulmonary fibrosis in Elovl6  /  mice.
Elovl6 depletion alters FA composition in vitro. To examine the
effects of Elovl6 knockdown on FA composition in alveolar type II
epithelial cells, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-medi￾ated approach to reduce Elovl6 gene expression in LA-4 cells, a
cell line derived from murine alveolar type II epithelial cells.
Elovl6 mRNA levels and elongase activity were significantly
decreased in siElovl6-introduced LA-4 cells (Fig. 4a,b). Of note,
Elovl6 depletion in LA-4 cells increased relative amounts of PA
(C16:0) and decreased OA (C18:1n-9; Fig. 4c). These changes
were analogous to those observed in Elovl6  /  mice. In addi￾tion, Elovl6 depletion in LA-4 cells significantly increased pal￾mitoleic acid (C16:1n-7) and decreased stearic acid (C18:0),
whereas LA (C18:2n-6) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) were
unchanged. Given that 18:2n-6 or 20:4n-6, long-chain FAs of the
n-6 series, can only be synthesized from precursors from dietary
precursors in vivo, the observation in Elovl6-depleted LA-4 cells
may not be relevant to the metabolism of 18:2n-6 or 20:4n-6 in
Elovl6  /  mice. However, these results indicate that Elovl6
depletion significantly changes FA composition in alveolar type II
epithelial cells in a manner similar to that observed in Elovl6  / 
lung.
Elovl6 depletion induces apoptosis and TGF-b1 expression. We
next tested whether Elovl6 deficiency by itself is causative for
apoptosis and TGF-b1 expression in LA-4 cells. Results showed
that Elovl6 knockdown induced caspase 3 activity (Fig. 4d,e) and
TGF-b1 gene expression (Fig. 4f). These results indicate that
Elovl6 deficiency is responsible for apoptosis and TGF-b1
production in LA-4 cells.
PA induces apoptosis and TGF-b1 expression. We examined the
effects of PA on apoptosis and TGF-b1 production in LA-4 cells.
PA induced caspase 3 activity (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary
Fig. S1b) and TGF-b1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5c) in a dose￾dependent manner. Next, we performed costimulation with PA
and OA, or LA in LA-4 cells. We found that OA and LA
attenuated PA-induced apoptosis and TGF-b1 mRNA expression
(Fig. 5c–e). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
alteration of FA composition, an increase in PA and a decrease in
OA drives the induction of apoptosis and TGF-b1 in alveolar type
II epithelial cells.
Elovl6 depletion and PA increase ROS generation. To test
whether an induction apoptosis and TGF-b1 expression by Elovl6
deficiency is mediated by ROS generation, we performed
immunohistochemical staining for nitrotyrosine, a marker of
oxidative stress22. Nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity was observed
in alveolar epithelial cells in Elovl6  /  mice but barely detected
in WT mice before BLM instillation (Fig. 6a). Furthermore,
nitrotyrosine-positive cells were increased in WT and Elovl6  / 
mice after BLM instillation (Fig. 6a). These findings suggest that
lack of Elovl6 per se might result in increased ROS production in
pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we
isolated primary alveolar type II epithelial cells from WT and
Elovl6  /  mice. Purity of alveolar type II epithelial cells was
confirmed by immunofluorescence staining with anti-SP-C anti￾body (Fig. 6b) and Nile red staining (Fig. 6c). Next, we examined
ROS production using CM-H2DCFDA (5-(6)-chloromethyl-20
,70
-
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester) probe in these
cells, and found that ROS production was detectable in alveolar
type II epithelial cells from Elovl6  /  mice but not from WT
mice (Fig. 6d). In accordance with these results, Elovl6 knock￾down induced ROS generation more prominently compared with
LA-4 cells treated with green fluorescent protein controls
(Fig. 6e). In addition, PA induced ROS generation and OA or LA
inhibited PA-induced ROS production in LA-4 cells (Fig. 6f).
Oxidative stress downregulates Elovl6 expression. BLM pro￾duces ROS in human lung23. Accordingly, we stimulated LA-4
cells with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2: 10 mM). H2O2 treatment
resulted in B75% decrease in Elovl6 mRNA levels as assessed by
qRT–PCR (relative mRNA expression of Elovl6/GAPDH; control
1.0±0.06 versus H2O2 0.25±0.06, means±s.d., N ¼ 6 per group,

expression is sensitive to ROS.

Discussion
Despite the considerable evidence that alveolar type II epithelial
cells have a central role in phospholipid containing surfactant
production, little attention has been paid for the regulation of
lipid metabolism in these cells. In the present study, we provide
several lines of evidence, indicating that the lack of Elovl6 has a
causative role in lung fibrosis. First, apoptosis and ROS
production were increased in Elovl6  /  lung. Second, alveolar
type II epithelial cells isolated from Elovl6  /  mice and LA-4
cells produced increased levels of ROS. Third, Elovl6 deficiency
increased PA and decreased OA and PUFA LA content in
alveolar type II epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Lastly,
expressions of the genes for FADS1, FADS2, FATPs and FAT/
CD36 were significantly reduced in Elovl6  /  mice, suggesting
that cellular uptake of long-chain FAs, including PUFA, was
impaired in Elovl6  /  mice. To our knowledge, this series of
evidence allows us to propose that an alteration of lipid
composition in alveolar type II epithelial cells in general and
Elovl6 deficiency in particular impinge on the survival and
function of alveolar type II epithelial cells, which have a crucial
role in the maintenance of lung homeostasis. In addition, we
show that Elovl6-mediated FA metabolism in the alveolar type II
epithelial cells is perturbed in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis
model, which could have important consequences in pulmonary
pathology.
We identified distinct expression of Elovl6 in alveolar type II
epithelial cells in the normal adult mice lung, where it has the
potential to regulate lipogenesis. Indeed, we found that Elovl6 / 
mice lung exhibited an increase in C16 PA and a decrease in
C18 OA content. Furthermore, LA-4 cells treated with siElovl6
showed an increase in both C16 PA and palmitoleic acid, and a
decrease in both C18 stearic acid and OA. These findings were

consistent with previous reports describing the effects of Elovl6
deficiency on hepatocytes and pancreatic b-cells15,16,24. Of
particular interest, we note that C18:2n-6 (LA), an essential
PUFA that can only be synthesized from dietary precursors, was
decreased in Elovl6  /  lung compared with those in WT lung.
To understand the mechanisms underlying this observation, we
examined the expression of the Elovl5, FADS1 and FADS2 genes
that promote the conversion of C18:2n-6 (LA) to C20:4n-6
(arachidonic acid). Results showed that FADS1 and FADS2
mRNA levels were significantly reduced in Elovl6  /  lung and
in BLM-treated mice lung. These results were contrary to our
expectation, because a decrease in FADS1 and FADS2 expression
is likely to cause an increase in C18:2n-6 (LA). Next, we examined
the expression of the genes for FATPs and FAT/CD36, all of
which have a major role in the cellular uptake of long-chain FAs.
As shown in Fig. 2g, the expression of the genes for FATP1, 3 and
4, and FAT/CD36, was significantly, or tended to be, decreased in
Elovl6  /  mice and in BLM-treated mice lung. Although the
molecular mechanisms underlying the decrease in the FATP1,
3 and 4, and FAT/CD36, gene expression in Elovl6  /  or BLM￾treated mice lungs remain to be determined, these data suggest
that a decrease in C18:2n-6 (LA) in Elovl6  /  lung is largely due
to a decrease in the uptake of long-chain FAs rather than the
alteration of elongation and desaturation processes. From these
in vivo and in vitro studies, an increase in C16 PA and/or a
decrease in C18 OA in alveolar type II epithelial cells contribute
to the pulmonary fibrosis in Elovl6  /  mice.
We demonstrated that Elovl6 deficiency resulted in exacerba￾tion of pulmonary fibrosis in mice when they are exposed to
BLM. A number of evidence established that BLM induced
apoptosis in the alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells25–27,
which has a key role in the initiation and progression of
pulmonary fibrosis28. Indeed, we found the induction of
apoptosis and caspase 3 activation in the lung from Elovl6  / 
mice, and confirmed them in Elovl6-kockdown LA-4 cells.
Therefore, it is likely to be that Elovl6 exerts its anti-apoptotic
effect in alveolar type II epithelial cells.
Our findings that PA induced caspase 3 activity in LA-4 cells,
and either OA or LA attenuated PA-induced caspase 3 activity,
are consistent with the previous reports described in a variety of
cell types29–35. Therefore, we hypothesize that the increased
apoptosis of alveolar type II epithelial cells in Elovl6  /  mice is
attributable to an increase in C16 PA and/or a decrease in C18
OA and C18 LA within the cells.
A working hypothesis illustrated in Fig. 7 emphasizes the role
of Elovl6 as a key regulator of the BLM-induced pulmonary
fibrosis based on the findings of the present study and pertinent
evidence from the previous studies. We found that Elovl6 deletion
and BLM instillation induced prominent changes in gene
expression involved in the synthesis and uptake of monounsa￾turated FA and PUFA. We showed that the expressions of the
FATP1, 3 and 4, and FAT/CD36, genes were significantly reduced
in mice treated with BLM, and FATP1 and 3 expressions were
decreased in Elovl6  /  mice. Given that FATP1, 3 and 4, and
FAT/CD36, have an important role in the uptake of long-chain
FAs from circulation, a decrease in the expression of these genes
are likely to account for the decrease in the content of LA, a
potent anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory lipid species, in
Elovl6  /  lung and BLM-treated lung.
In addition, in concert with the abundant evidence indicating
that ROS is central to BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis25,36–38,
our study demonstrate that alveolar type II epithelial cells in
Elovl6  /  mice produce more ROS than those in WT mice as
assessed by staining with antibody against nitrotyrosine. These
results help explain why Elovl6  /  mice are more susceptible to
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
As excessive amount of extracellular matrix was synthesized
and deposited in the lung of Elovl6  /  mice treated with BLM,
and as TGF-b1 has an indispensable role in the activation of
alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts, the key effector cells
in fibrinogenesis39,40, we sought evidence for whether Elovl6
deficiency may induce TGF-b1 expression in alveolar cells. As
expected, we found that TGF-b1 mRNA levels were increased in
the lung of Elovl6  /  mice in comparison with WT mice, and
TGF-b1 gene expression was upregulated by siRNA for Elovl6 in
LA-4 cell. Figure 7 illustrates these results.
The potential mechanisms underlying the upregulation of
TGF-b1 expression in Elovl6-deficient cells also warrant con￾sideration. We found that exposure of LA-4 cells to PA induced
TGF-b1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, and this
response was blunted in the presence of OA and LA in the culture
medium. These observations were consistent with the previous
reports using pancreatic b-cell line41. Toll-like receptor
4-dependent and -independent signalling pathways have been
documented to mediate the response to extracellular FAs. In
addition, there has been much evidence indicating that
intracellular FAs regulate the gene expression, at least partly
through the generation of ROS and ligands for peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor or liver X receptor family
receptors, as do the exogenously supplied FAs exert their effects
after they are taken up in the cells42–44. Thus, it seems reasonable
to speculate that an increase in PA relative to OA and LA levels
within the alveolar type II epithelial cells is responsible for the
induction of TGF-b1. Further studies are required to determine
to what extent signalling pathways leading to TGF-b1 gene
induction overlap between the stimuli with exogenous and
endogenous FAs.
Our findings that dysregulation of lipid metabolism in alveolar
type II epithelial cells due to Elovl6 deficiency contributes to
pulmonary fibrosis has an important clinical relevance. Diabetes

Figure 7 | Schematic diagram of pulmonary fibrosis caused by Elovl6
deficiency. BLM induces ROS generation in the lung, and oxidative stress
downregulates Elovl6 expression in alveolar epithelial cells. Subsequently,
the loss of Elovl6 function induces the change of FA composition in which
cytotoxic PA is increased and cytoprotective OA and LA are decreased in
alveolar type II epithelial cells, resulting in increment of ROS generation,
followed by induction of apoptosis and TGF-b1 expression. These Elovl6
deficiency induced inductions of ROS, apoptosis and TGF-b1 can progress
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

has been described as a risk factors associated with pulmonary
fibrosis. Usuki et al.45 revealed that hyperglycaemia influenced
the severity of pulmonary fibrosis in diabetic mice treated with
BLM. In addition, Miyake et al.46 demonstrated that intake of
saturated FA and meat was associated with a 6.3- and 7.2-fold
increased risk of IPF, respectively. Given that Elovl6 gene
expression is downregulated upon exposure to hydrogen
peroxide, we assume that predisposition to pulmonary fibrosis
of the patients with diabetes or overnutrition may be attributed to
the susceptibility of Elovl6 expression to oxidative stress. Indeed,
immunohistochemistry of human lung tissue revealed that Elovl6
expression was barely detectable in IPF patients.
In conclusion, this study allow us to propose novel mechan￾isms of pulmonary fibrosis by which derangement of Elovl6-
mediating FA balance initiates ROS production and apoptosis in
alveolar type II epithelial cells, and have an important role in
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. These findings reveal a
previously unappreciated role of lipid composition in alveolar
type II epithelial cells in the pulmonary pathophysiology. Future
research will need to establish whether Elovl6 may be a potential
target for the treatment of IPF.
Methods
Reagents. Kaighn’s F-12K Nutrient Mixture was purchased from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA). Fetal bovine serum was from Biowest (Nuaille, France). Elovl6
antibody was purchased from ABGENT (San Diego, CA), SP-C antibody was from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); cleaved-caspase 3, caspase 3, nitro￾tyrosine and b-actin were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). FA-free
BSA, PA and BSA-conjugated OA and LA solution were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrogen peroxide (50 mM) was from Wako (Osaka, Japan).
Mice. Elovl6  /  mice were a kind gift from Dr H. Shimano (Tsukuba University).
These mice were intercrossed with Elovl6  /  or Elovl6  / þ mice. Littermates
were genotyped by PCR. Eight-week-old male WT and Elovl6  /  mice were
anaesthetized and instilled with BLM (1 mg kg  1) intratracheally using a micro￾sprayer (Penn-Century, Philadelphia, PA) as described previously47. Control mice
received saline. Mice were killed at 7, 14 and 21 days after BLM administration.
Tissue preparation. Following the incubation of deep anaesthesia, mice were
killed and the left lungs were ligated and excised immediately. Tissue was frozen
rapidly and stored at  70 C until qRT–PCR and western blot analysis. The right
lungs were inflated by instilling with 10% formalin at a constant pressure of 25-cm
formalin for 10 min and fixed for 24 h before paraffin embedding. Human lung
tissues were obtained from patients at autopsy and tissue samples were fixed in
formalin and embedded in paraffin. Each serial section (4 mm) was prepared for
histological analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated
before antigen retrieval by boiling in citrate buffer. Elovl6, SP-C and nitrotyrosine
stainings were performed using the Vectastatin Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacture’s instruction, with 3,30
-diamino￾benzidine as the chromogenic substrate. Sections were stained with haematoxylin
and eosin or Masson’s trichrome using standard procedures. Masson’s trichrome
staining was used to detect fibrosis in lung sections, and the percentage of fibrosis
areas were calculated as previously described48 using ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health). Briefly, the histological sections were captured using an
Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The images
coloured by Masson’s trichrome blue were extracted and quantified in percentage
in the area of each samples. The grade of pulmonary fibrosis in the lung sections
was scored on a scale of 0–8 using Ashcroft scoring method49. The severity of
fibrotic changes in each histological section of the lung was assessed as the mean
score of severity from observed microscopic fields. After the examination of 30
randomly chosen regions in each sample at a magnification of  100, the mean
score of all the fields was taken as the fibrosis score. Grading was done in a blinded
manner by three observers.
RNA isolation and qRT–PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the mouse lung
tissue and LA-4 cell using ISOGEN regent (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. One microgram of RNA was used for reverse trans￾cription with the RNA LA PCR Kit (Takara Bio) and qRT–PCR analysis was
performed using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan)
according to the manufacturers’ protocol. qRT–PCR analysis was carried out using
a MX3000P quantitative system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All primer sequences are
shown in Supplementary Table S1. Three samples were used, respectively, for each
of the three experiments performed.
Elongase activity. Microsomal FA elongation activity was assayed by the mea￾surement of [2-14C]-malonyl-CoA incorporation into exogenous acyl-CoAs as
described previously15, with some modification. Briefly, the assay mixtures
contained 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 mM palmitoyl-CoA, 500 mM NADPH and
freshly obtained microsomal protein, all in a final volume of 0.25 ml. After 2 min of
preincubation at 37 C, the reaction was started by the addition of 60 mM malonyl￾CoA (containing 0.037 mCi of [2-14C] malonyl-CoA). After 10 min incubation at
37 C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of 10% KOH in methanol and
saponified at 65 C for 1 h. After acidification with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 5 N HCl, the
free FAs were extracted from the mixture three times with 1 ml of hexane (total
volume, 3 ml). The pooled hexane fractions were dried, and after addition of 3 ml of
scintillation mixture the radioactivity incorporated was counted in a scintillator
counter (Aloca LSC3000). Blanks were measured in parallel reactions incubated
without microsomal fractions.
Collagen assay. The Sircol assay (Biocolor Ltd, Belfast, UK) was carried out
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the lung tissue was homogenized
and total collagen was solubilized in 0.5 M acetic acid. Next, sirius red reagent was
added to each lung homogenate and mixed for 30 min. The collagen–dye complex
was precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 r.p.m. for 10 min and dissolved in
0.5 M NaOH. Finally, the sample’s absorbance was determined at 540 nm and
compared with a calibration curve generated using the collagen standard provided
by the manufacturer.
FA composition. Lipids from mouse whole lung and LA-4 cell were extracted by
Bligh and Dyer method50. Briefly, lung tissues and cells were extracted with
chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) solution. One molar NaCl solution and chloroform
were added to break the monophase and incubated on ice for 10 min. After
centrifugation at 2,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, aqueous solution was discarded and
chloroform phase was transferred to test tube. Chloroform phase was evaporated
using nitrogen gas and the obtained lipids were requested for FA composition
analysis to an external laboratory (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
TUNEL staining. For labelling nuclei of apoptotic cells, sections were stained with
TUNEL method using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Western blot analysis. Tissue samples and cells were homogenized on ice in
RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium
deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS, and containing complete mini and phosSTOP solu￾tion (Roche). The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 r.p.m. for 30 min and super￾natant was subjected to SDS–PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by
the Bradford method using a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Western
blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures using the following
primary antibodies: rabbit monoclonal cleaved-caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Tech￾nology, catalogue number 9664, 1:250), caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology,
catalogue number 9665, 1:250) and b-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, catalogue
number 4970, 1:500). Antigens were revealed by Immobilon Western HRP Sub￾strate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase￾conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The band’s density was quantified using ImageJ
software.
ELISA assay for TGF-b1. The protein level of TGF-b1 in the mouse lung tissue
was measured using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The protocol
followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Total TGF-b1 levels were determined by
acid activation (1 M hydrochloric acid, 10 min, room temperature) of the latent
TGF-b1 in the homogenate.
Preparation of FA solution. PA was conjugated to FA-free BSA at a 3.5:1 molar
ratio by dissolving them in ethanol and mixing with an aqueous BSA solution (BSA
in PBS) at 37 C until homogeneous, after which they were passed through a
0.2-mM filter.
Culture of LA-4 cells. Mouse lung type II epithelial cells (LA-4) were obtained
from ATCC. LA-4 cells were cultured using Kaighn’s F-12 K Nutrient Mixture
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a
5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 C. Serum-starved LA-4 cells with 0.1% BSA (24 h) were
incubated in the presence or absence of BSA-conjugated PA, OA and LA
(100–250 mM each). To examine the regulation of Elovl6 mRNA expression,
hydrogen peroxide (50 mM) was also stimulated. After 24 h incubation at 37 C,
mRNA or protein was collected from the cells.

Isolation of alveolar type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type II epithelial cells were
isolated from Elovl6  /  and WT C57BL/6 mice, as described51, with minor
modifications52. Briefly, the lungs were perfused with PBS injected through the
right ventricle until the lungs were cleared of blood. Two millilitres of dispase
(50 U ml  1; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were instilled into the lungs and the
syringe was left in place to prevent leakage of dispase. The lungs were then
removed and transferred in 1 ml dispase for 45 min at room temperature. Lung
tissue was separated from large bronchi by mechanical means with forceps and
transferred to 5 ml of DMEM with 0.01% DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm
culture plate, and chopped into fine pieces, followed by 10-min incubation at 37 C.
This crude preparation was filtered through 100-, 40- and 20-mm cell strainers
(Millipore), and centrifuged at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4 C. The cell pellet was
resuspended in 10 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS and placed on anti-CD45- (BD
Bioscience) and anti-CD32- (BD Bioscience) coated petri dishes at 37 C for 1 h to
remove adherent macrophages. The unbound cells were collected and inoculated
into non-coated culture plates at 37 C for 1 h to remove adherent fibroblast. The
remaining cells were collected and centrifuged (1,000 r.p.m. for 10 min). The pellet
was resuspended in tissue culture medium consisting of DMEM/F-12 (Life
Technologies), 1 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes, 0.25% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), 5%
mouse serum (Equitech-Bio, Kerrville, TX), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids
(Life Technologies), 0.05% insulin–transferrin–sodium selenite (BD Bioscience)
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies). The cells were then seeded on
type I collagen-coated eight-well slide glass and maintained at 37 C with 10% CO2.
After 24 h, cells were washed and medium was replaced with serum-free medium.
The isolated alveolar type II epithelial cells were confirmed by immunofluor￾escence staining using anti-SP-C antibody purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech￾nology. Secondary staining was performed with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG.
Alveolar type II epithelial cells were also identified by staining with modified Nile
red (Wako), a lipophilic fluorescent dye that can label cellular lipid droplet in
alveolar type II epithelial cells isolated from WT and Elovl6  /  mice. Nile red,
dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide, was added to unfixed cells in PBS (5 mg ml  1)
and incubated for 10 min at room temperature to label the cells. The cells were
washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and examined using
fluorescence microscope. For each experiment, alveolar type II epithelial cells were
95% pure as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for SP-C and the presence
of Nile red-positive vacuoles.
Construction of siRNA oligonucleotide and transfection. siRNA oligonucleo￾tides (mouse siElovl6: 50
-CGU CAU GUA CUC UUA CUA CGC-30
, siGFP:
50
-GUU CAG CGU GUC CGG CGA GTT-30
) were purchased from BONAC
Corporation (Fukuoka, Japan) and transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
Regent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Estimation of ROS generation. Intracellular ROS levels were detected with the
oxidant-sensitive fluorogenic probes CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen Life Technolo￾gies). Isolated alveolar type II epithelial cells from Elovl6  /  and WT mice were
incubated with 1 mM CM-H2DCFDA in serum-free medium for 5 min at 37 C.
siRNA-transfected LA-4 cells were incubated with 10 mM CM-H2DCFDA in
serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 C. Next, the cells were incubated in the
presence or absence of PA, OA and LA for 15 min. After incubation at 37 C,
fluorescence was detected.
Statistical analysis. All data are shown as mean±s.d. Two-group comparison
was analysed by Mann–Whitney U-test or unpaired Student’s t-test, and
multiple-group comparison was performed by one-way analysis of variance with
Steel–Dwass or Tukey–Kramer’s multiple comparison tests. A P-value o0.05 was
considered significant.
Ethical approval. Animal experiments using these mice were approved by and
performed according to the guidelines of the Committee of Experimental Animal
Research of Gunma University (permit number: 10-019). Human lung tissues were
obtained from patients at autopsy with written informed consent of their family at
the Gunma University Hospital. This protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the Gunma University Hospital.
