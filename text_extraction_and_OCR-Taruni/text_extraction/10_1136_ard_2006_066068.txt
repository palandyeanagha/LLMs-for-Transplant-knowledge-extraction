Abstract
Background: Survival of scleroderma has changed since the renal
crisis treatment has become possible.
Aims: To document the changes in survival and organ system
causes of mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc) over the past 25 years
in patients from a single medical centre.
Methods: Consecutive patients evaluated at the University of
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA between 1 January 1972
and 31 December 1996 were studied. Survival was determined in
five 5-year time periods between 1972 and 1997. Causes of death
included scleroderma-related (scleroderma renal crisis, pulmonary
arterial hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis (PF), gastrointestinal (GI),
heart and multiorgan failure) and non-scleroderma-related (cancer,
atherosclerotic cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, infection,


sudden death, other and unknown) causes.
Results: The 10-year survival improved steadily from 54% to 66%
during each of the time intervals. There was a significant
improvement in survival for patients during 1982–91 compared
with those during 1972–81 (p<0.001), even when patients with
renal crisis were excluded (p<0.005). The frequency of deaths due
to renal crisis significantly decreased over the 30-year time period,
from 42% to 6% of scleroderma-related deaths (p<0.001), whereas
the proportion of patients with scleroderma who died of PF
increased from 6% to 33% (p<0.001). The frequency of pulmonary
hypertension, independent of PF, also significantly increased during
this time period (p<0.05). There were no changes in scleroderma
GI- and heart-related deaths, nor in any of the non-scleroderma-
related causes, although patients with scleroderma were less likely
to die from scleroderma-related problems in the past 15 years.
Conclusion: The change in the pattern of scleroderma-related
deaths over the past 30 years demonstrates that the lung (both
pulmonary hypertension and PF) is the primary cause of
scleroderma-related deaths today. It is important that aggressive
searches continue to develop better therapies for these severe
pulmonary complications of SSc.
