Abstract
We have generated human hepatocyte spheroids with uniform size and shape by co-culturing 1:1 mixtures of primary
human hepatocytes (hHeps) from partial hepatectomy specimens and human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) in
concave microwells. The hADSCs in spheroids could compensate for the low viability and improve the functional
maintenance of hHeps. Co-cultured spheroids aggregated and formed compact spheroidal shapes more rapidly, and with a
significantly higher viability than mono-cultured spheroids. The liver-specific functions of co-cultured spheroids were
greater, although they contained half the number of hepatocytes as mono-cultured spheroids. Albumin secretion by co￾cultured spheroids was 10% higher on day 7, whereas urea secretion was similar, compared with mono-cultured spheroids.
A quantitative cytochrome P450 assay showed that the enzymatic activity of co-cultured spheroids cultured for 9 days was
28% higher than that of mono-cultured spheroids. These effects may be due to the transdifferentiation potential and
paracrine healing effects of hADSCs on hHeps. These co-cultured spheroids may be useful for creating artificial three￾dimensional hepatic tissue constructs and for cell therapy with limited numbers of human hepatocytes.

Introduction
The number of patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis is
increasing continuously, accounting for 9.9 deaths per 100,000
population in the U.S. in 2009 [1]. Liver transplantation is the
only long-term option for patients with end-stage liver disease, but
is limited by the shortage of donors, its high cost, the high rate of
rejection, and potential risks for living donors. Human liver-cell￾based therapies, such as the bio-artificial liver and hepatocyte
transplantation, may be an alternative to liver transplantation,
decreasing the mortality rate of patients on the waiting list.
Although several types of bio-artificial liver have been described,
most are extracorporeal systems for short term use and their
clinical success has been limited [2]. Hepatocyte-based therapies
are less invasive than whole-organ or partial liver transplantation,
with the possibility of repetition, and do not require chronic
immunosuppression [3]. Hepatocyte transplantation, however,
requires a continuous supply of human primary hepatocytes and
their in vitro culture with functional maintenance for a period of
time. To date, most primary human hepatocytes have been
isolated from the livers of multi-organ donors (MODs) who were
rejected from a transplantation program due to histological
impairment or from liver specimens obtained during partial
hepatectomy [4]. Although primary human hepatocytes from
partial hepatectomy specimens are more reliable and useful
sources, their viability is poor (40–80%), resulting in the more
frequent use of hepatocytes from MODs [5,6]. However,
obtaining MODs are as cumbersome as entire transplantable
livers. Therefore, increasing the number and viability of primary
hepatocytes from partial hepatectomy specimens, and improving
their functional maintenance, are of great importance for
successful hepatocyte transplantation.
We describe here a novel method for using primary human cells
from partial hepatectomy specimens to overcome these obstacles,
including cell shortage and low viability. The key feature of this
method is the generation of spheroids by co-culturing primary
human hepatocytes (hHeps) and human adipose-derived stem cells
(hADSCs) in concave microwell arrays. Culturing of hepatocytes
as spheroids, which enhances the vitality and maintenance of
hepatic performance, has been shown to improve their viability
and function [7,8]. Human adipose tissue has been shown to
contain mesenchymal stem cell populations and hADSCs [9,10].
The culture of hADSCs in media supplemented with growth
factors and cytokines has been found to yield cells with hepatocyte￾PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e50723

specific functions, including albumin production and urea
synthesis [11,12]. Based on these findings, we co-cultured both
cells in 3D spheroid expecting a positively compensating effect.
Such 3D co-culturing dramatically enhanced the viability of
hHeps from partial hepatectomy specimens, spheroid formation
with uniform shape and hepatic function, and enabled hADSCs to
be transdifferentiated into hepatocyte-like cells without additional
processes. These uniform-sized co-cultured spheroids may be
useful sources for human liver transplantation and human
hepatocyte cell therapy. Furthermore, they might be used to
create 3D human liver models and to facilitate studies of human
liver physiology and pathophysiology, as well as contributing to the
recovery of failed human liver function and the development of
bioartificial liver systems, overcoming cell shortage problems.
Materials and Methods
Isolation and culture of primary hHeps and hADSCs
Human hepatocytes were isolated under sterile conditions from
the healthy resection margins of liver samples obtained during
partial hepatectomy, using a two-step collagenase perfusion
technique [13]. Briefly, liver tissue was perfused at 37uC with
ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether)-N,N-tetraacetic acid
(EGTA), followed by 0.1% collagenase at a flow speed that
depended on the size of the liver specimen. The digested liver
tissue was placed in cold Leffert’s buffer, the liver capsules were
cut, and cells were dissociated. Hepatocytes were mobilized by
gentle shaking, and the suspension was filtered through a nylon
mesh of pore size 70 mm. The cell suspension was centrifuged 3
times at 506g for 5 minutes each at 4uC to separate the
hepatocytes from the nonparenchymal cells. Hepatocyte viability
and concentration were determined using the Trypan blue
exclusion technique; the average viability of isolated hepatocytes
was 62% (Table 1). Primary human hepatocytes were cultured in
high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 20 mM HEPES (Sigma Aldrich), 25 mM
NaHCO3, 30 mg/L-proline, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
25 U/ml penicillin, 25 mg/ml streptomycin, 10 mg/ml gentami￾cin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 50 ng/ml insulin,
1024 M dexamethasone, 10 mM nicotinamide, and 100 mM L￾ascorbic acid. hADSCs were isolated from leftover human
subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients undergoing plastic surgery
or liposuction, as described [14]. Isolated hADSCs were cultured
and expanded at 37uC in low-glucose DMEM containing 10%
FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin, in an
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All procedures adhered to the
guidelines of the IRB of Korea University. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients, and the protocol of this
study was approved by the hospital ethics committee.
Formation of mono- and co-cultured spheroids
Spheroids were generated using poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS)-based concave micromolds developed using thin PDMS
membranes [15–17]. Concave micromolds of 500 mm diameter
were fabricated using soft lithography techniques. The concave
microwells were coated with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin
(BSA) overnight to prevent cell attachment. Human hepatocytes
were seeded onto these wells and cultured for a few days to form
mono-cultured spheroids. To form co-cultured spheroids, the wells
were seeded with a 1:1 mixture of human hepatocytes and
hADSCs and the cells were cultured for a few days (Fig. 1). Cell
aggregation and spheroid formation were observed daily under a
microscope.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
Spheroids formed in concave microwells were fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in deionized water for 1 h and gently washed 3–5
times with deionized water. For secondary fixation, spheroids were
immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide in deionized water for 1–2 h.
The fixed spheroids were subsequently dehydrated with a graded
ethanol series (25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, and 100%), immersed in
tert-butyl alcohol three times for 30 min each at room temper￾ature and frozen at 270uC. The spheroids were freeze-dried until
the tert-butyl alcohol had evaporated, mounted onto a specimen
stub with graphite paste, coated with palladium alloy, and
observed under a scanning electron microscope (JEOL Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Spheroids formed from hHeps and hADSCs in concave PDMS
microwells for 7 days were fixed in a solution containing
glutaraldehyde. The samples were sliced and observed under a
transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated
at 80 kV.
Immunofluorescence staining
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at
4uC and incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. After rinsing with
0.1% BSA in PBS, the cells were incubated with Block Ace
(Dainippon Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) at 4uC for 30 min and
subsequently incubated overnight at 4uC with rabbit antibodies to
serum albumin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, USA) and
cytochrome P450 reductase (Abcam, UK). The cells were rinsed
with 0.1% BSA in PBS and incubated at 4uC for 90 min with
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti￾rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies, as appropriate. The
cells were then incubated with DAPI (40,6-diamidino-2-pheny￾Table 1. Isolation of primary human hepatocytes from partial

lindole) for 5 min at room temperature, and confocal microscopic
images were obtained (Olympus, Japan).
Cell viability
Cell viability was assessed by incubating spheroids with 50 mM
Calcein-AM and 25 mg/ml ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1;
Molecular Probes, USA) in culture medium for 40 min at 37uC,
followed by imaging under a light microscope.
Functional assessment
Albumin and urea secretion were analyzed by measuring the
concentrations of albumin and urea in medium conditioned by
cultured spheroids. Spheroids were cultured in concave PDMS
microwells for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days; at each time point, 300 ml of
medium was removed and replaced with 300 ml of fresh medium.
Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymatic activity was deter￾mined using the luminescent P450-Glo CYP3A4 Cell-based Assay
(Luciferin-PFBE) (Promega), as described by the manufacturer.
Briefly, mono- or co-cultured spheroids were incubated with
luminogenic substrate (Luciferin-PFBE) in hepatocyte culture
medium for 3–4 h at 37uC. The medium was subsequently
transferred to a 96-well opaque white plate, and an equal volume
of Luciferin Detection Reagent was added to initiate a luminescent
reaction. The plate was incubated at room temperature for
20 min, and luminescence was read using a Multimode Plate
Reader (PerkinElmer).
Gene analysis
Co-cultured spheroids in concave microwells were gently
retrieved after 3 and 7 days. Total RNA was isolated from these
cell preparations, as well as from freshly isolated hepatocytes, using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA), chloroform extraction and
precipitation with isopropyl alcohol. cDNA was synthesized from
the purified RNA using reverse transcriptase (TAKARA, Japan) as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Results
As shown in Fig. 1A, hHeps were isolated from human liver
specimens after partial hepatectomy, and details for specimen are
summarized in Table 1. hADSCs were from leftover human
subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients undergoing plastic surgery
or liposuction. We seeded prepared cells in concave microarray
wells, which has been an excellent cell spheroid production
platform for rodent hepatocytes, b-cells and stem cells [15–17], to
generate uniformly-sized and shaped spheroids (mono-culture of
hHeps and 1:1 co-culture of hHeps and hADSCs) (Fig. 1B). The
characteristics of mono-cultured and co-cultured spheroids,
including their size, shape, and viability, were assessed quantita￾tively over time. Contrary to rodent hepatocyte cells, [17] the
mono-culture of hHeps did not generate well-organized ultra￾structures. Although sufficient hHeps were seeded on concave
microwells, they were hardly aggregated and did not form
uniform-shaped spheroids until they were cultured for 7 days
because of the poor condition of hHeps from partial hepatectomy
specimens. In contrast, the 1:1 co-culture of hHeps and hADSCs
created stable and uniformly-sized spheroids one day after the
seeding (Fig. 2). Cell viability in mono-cultured and co-cultured
spheroids after 3 and 7 days was 47% vs 99% and 64% vs 99%,
respectively (Fig. 2A–D). Magnified fluorescent images of single
mono-cultured and co-cultured spheroids on day 9 show that long￾term culture and the retrieval process did not affect cell viability
(Fig. S1).
To compare the size of mono-cultured and co-cultured
spheroids quantitatively, we measured their diameters over time
(Fig. 2E). Following culture for 1 day in 500 mm microwells, their
average sizes were reduced to 250 mm and 200 mm, respectively,
and decreased to 225 mm and 170 mm, respectively, on day 3. The
size of co-cultured spheroids remained almost constant through
days 5–9, in contrast to the size of mono-cultured spheroids, which
decreased. These results show that co-cultured spheroids aggre￾gated more rapidly and formed a tighter spheroidal shape than
mono-cultured spheroids.
SEM images clearly showed that co-cultured spheroids aggre￾gated more tightly and rapidly than mono-cultured spheroids and
had smoother surfaces (Fig. 3A–D). Mono-cultured spheroids on

day 3 lost their original shape during SEM preparation due to
loose cell-cell interaction. In contrast, the aggregates of co-cultured
spheroids became denser and had smoother surfaces over time.
Immunostained images of the actin in spheroids clearly demon￾strate the tight cell-cell interaction on the surface (Fig. 3E and F).
Mono-cultured spheroids had cell-like round surfaces, whereas co￾cultured spheroids had smooth surfaces demonstrating tight cell￾cell interaction. SEM images of cryosectioned spheroids co￾cultured for 3 and 9 days showed tight porous structures and no
necrosis was observed (Fig. 3G and H).
We analyzed the liver specific functions of these spheroids by
measuring albumin and urea secretion. Quantitative analysis
showed that the co-cultured spheroids secreted about 10% more
albumin than mono-cultured spheroids, although the former
contained only about half the number of hHeps (Fig. 4A); urea
secretion by co-cultured and mono-cultured spheroids was similar

(Fig. 4B). The immunostained image also showed that the human
albumin was expressed strongly on co-cultured spheroids, despite
half the cells being hADSCs (Fig. S2).
We analyzed the metabolic activity of hepatocytes, by staining
with cytochrome P450 reductase and by monitoring CYP3A4
activity over 9 days. The results showed that the expression of
cytochrome P450 reductase (red) was greater in the exterior cells of
co-cultured than that of mono-cultured spheroids (Fig. 4C and D).
In addition, a luminescence assay showed higher and more stable
CYP3A4 enzymatic activity in co-cultured than in mono-cultured
spheroids (Fig. 4E).
Seven days after seeding, we examined the ultrastructure of co￾cultured spheroids formed within concave microwells by TEM
(Fig. 5). These spheroids displayed multi-cell layer morphology
with elongated cell features and tight junctions (Tj) between
adjacent cells, emphasizing close cell-cell interactions. The cells in
spheroids exhibited distinct nuclei (N), abundant mitochondria
(M), rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), and glycogens (Gl)
(Fig. 5A–C). Furthermore, these cells displayed polarity, as shown
by the presence of bile canaliculi (B) possessing microvilli,
bordered by tight junctions (Fig. 5E) [18]. Similar features have
been observed in spheroids formed by primary rat hepatocytes
[19] and human hepatocyte cell lines [20]. Abundant peroxisomal
(P) vesicles are often present, as is the accumulation of extracellular
matrix, such as collagen, over a broad area (Fig. 5C). Compared
with TEM images of hADSCs cultured for 7 days alone (Fig. S3),
hADSCs in co-cultured spheroids exhibited different features and
looked more similar to hHeps than hADSCs. These results suggest
that hADSCs might be transdifferentiated to hepatocyte-like cells.
To determine whether hADSCs within the co-cultured spher￾oids express hepatocyte-like features, we assayed the mRNA
expression levels of CYP3A7, a marker of immature hepatocytes,
and ALB, CYP3A4, glutamine synthetase, CYP1B1 and CK18,
which are markers of mature hepatocytes, in co-cultured spheroids
on days 3 and 7, and in hADSC spheroids on day 3 (Fig. 6). The
mRNA expression levels of all markers became higher in co￾cultured spheroids than in hADSC spheroids as time passed,
which indicates that hADSCs in co-cultured spheroids exhibited
hepatocyte-like features.
Discussion
We have shown here that uniformly-sized and shaped hHeps
and hHeps-hADSCs spheroids could be successfully generated in
concave microwell arrays. Because producing uniform 3D
hepatocyte spheroids are very important, several approaches have
been previously reported to date, including non-adherent surface,
matrix array, and rocked culture. However, the development of

well-controlled 3D culture systems that can produce large amounts
of size-controlled uniform spheroids has remained a challenge. In
the concave microarray wells that were used in this paper, we
could overcome all these obstacles and achieved the production of
large amounts of size-controllable uniform spheroids very easily
and rapidly. Moreover, these spheroids were detached easily from
the wells, without the need for treatment with trypsin or
collagenase due to the concave-morphology effect [17], and this
retrieval process did not affect cell viability at all. This kind of
polymer based microwells also could be applied as useful tools in
embryoid body (EB) formation instead of conventional methods
like hanging-drop and suspension culture [16,21]. The 3D co￾culture of hHeps and hADSCs improves the spheroid formation
and functional maintenance of hHeps so it can compensate for the
lack of hHeps. To date, there have been a few reports describing
the use of hADSCs in a 2D culture environment for the functional
improvement of human hepatocytes [22], however, a 3D co￾culture model is very rare. Moreover, the quantitative evaluation
of 3D co-culture effects between hHeps and hADSCs may be the
first to our knowledge. Our 3D co-culture model showed the
positive effects of hADSCs on hepatocyte function and spheroid
formation, which might be the first of its kind. We found that the
mono-cultured hHeps spheroids did not show cellular aggregation
until day 9, demonstrated by individual cells at the spheroid
surface (Fig. 3A and B white arrows). In contrast, the mixture of
hHeps and hADSCs was aggregated rapidly, forming compact
spheroids in concave microwells by day 3, which indicates that
hADSCs could play a key role in spheroid formation of hHeps
similar to hepatic-stellate cells [17]. SEM images of mono- and co￾cultured spheroids clearly demonstrated the effects of hADSCs on
compact spheroid formation. The size of co-cultured spheroids
decreased drastically after cell seeding, which might be due to tight
cell-cell interactions. Though initial viability of hHeps was diverse
between liver specimen samples, the viability of co-cultured
spheroids was much higher than that of mono-cultured spheroids
regardless of sample diversity. Gimble et al. reported that hADSCs
transferred into a site of tissue injury or disease may secrete
cytokines and growth factors that stimulate recovery in a paracrine
manner by stimulating the activity of antioxidant chemicals, free
radical scavengers, and chaperone/heat shock proteins [10]. Such
wound healing effects of hADSCs may be related to the
improvements in poor viability and spheroid formation of human
hepatocytes. The interior structures of co-cultured spheroids were
imaged by the cryosectioned spheroids cultured for 3 and 9 days,
revealing that the interiors of both spheroids were porous.
Nutrients and gases could easily diffuse through these pores,
potentially accounting for the absence of central necrosis, even in
spheroids over 170 mm in diameter.
The hepatic functions of spheroids were evaluated by assaying
their secretion of albumin and urea over 7 days. Both types of
spheroids secreted albumin and urea continuously, yet, co￾cultured spheroids secreted a little greater quantity of albumin,
despite having only half the number of hHeps as the mono￾cultured system. Immunodetection of cytochrome P450 reductase
and analyses of the enzymatic activity of CYP3A4 showed that the
levels and activity of this enzyme, one of the most important for
the metabolism of xenobiotics, were comparatively higher in co￾cultured than in mono-cultured spheroids. Although the absolute
functional activities of human hepatocytes vary among liver
samples, we found that co-cultured spheroids generally functioned
better than mono-cultured spheroids. These results indicate that
hepatic function and phenotype were better maintained in our 3D
model.
TEM images showed well-developed hepatic ultrastructural
characteristics. The spheroids maintained their viability and
function for 1 week in culture, and demonstrated the extensive
appearance of metabolism-related organelles, including mitochon￾dria, rER, peroxisomes, and endocytosis or exocytosis (Fig. 5D
black arrow), which indicates that metabolic functions were well
preserved in 3D spheroidal culture. They were also making a
number of new tight junctions (Fig. 5E skeletal arrows), indicating
that hepatocytic interaction was conducted continuously. Al￾though the SEM image of the co-cultured spheroid showed tight
junctions, the cell membranes were not closely attached to each
other, with many non-cellular spaces occupied by ECM-like
materials (Fig. 5A and C, Col). These non-cellular spaces may play
a role in exchanging nutrients and gases. Although these spheroids
were co-cultured with hADSCs, they exhibited hepatocytic
ultrastructural features, rather than hADSCs’. From these
experimental results, we expected that the reason for the high
performance of co-cultured spheroids, despite having half the
number of hepatocytes, may be from the differentiation of
hADSCs into mostly hepatocyte-like cells in co-cultured spheroids,
which can improve hepatocytic functions and features. To date,
several researchers have reported that hepatocyte-like cells can be
generated from hADSCs by the sequential addition of growth
factors in vitro for the transdifferentiation of hADSCs into
hepatocyte-like cells [11,23,24]. Only at high density could fetal
hepatic cells and MSCs be induced to form cells with a hepatocyte
phenotype [25]. Furthermore, adult hepatocyte progenitor cells
were found to express high levels of mature hepatocyte markers
when cultured in spheroids [22,26]. Based on these studies, we can
conclude that our spheroidal model could provide the adequate
environment for hADSCs to transdiffrentiate into hepatocyte-like
cells via high cell density and the tight cell-cell interaction feature
of spheroids. For the proof of this hypothesis, gene-based studies
were performed. The co-cultured spheroids expressed high levels
of immature and mature hepatocyte markers, including CYP3A7,
ALB, CYP3A4, glutamine synthetase, CYP1B1 and CK18 though
they consisted of 50% hADSCs. Human MSCs in cell pellets have
been shown to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells that express a
subset of hepatic genes and in which CYP3A4 mRNA is inducible.
However, mono-cultured hADSCs spheroids exhibited lower
levels of hepatocytic gene expression compared to the co-cultured
model, indicating that hepatocytic gene expression of hADSCs
may be enhanced by not only a spheroidal shape, but also co￾culture with hHeps and direct cell-cell interaction.
In summary, we discovered that hADSCs in co-cultured 3D
spheroids assist in the formation of compact hepatic spheroids in
concave microwell arrays, enhance the viability of hepatocytes
even from partial hepatectomy, and behave like hepatocytes. The
shortage of donor hHeps is a serious obstacle for successful cell￾based liver regeneration, whereas hADSCs, which can be
repeatedly obtained in large quantities under local anesthesia,
may be a promising cell source for clinical use [27]. Co-cultured
spheroids may provide a new therapeutic modality as a cell
transplantation paradigm for end-stage or acute liver failure
patients. In addition, these co-cultured spheroids could be used in
extracorporeal bioartificial livers. Furthermore, a 3D co-cultured
spheroid model might be used for the in vitro liver model for the
study of interaction between hepatocyte and non-parenchymal
cells. As hADSCs can be differentiated toward osteogenic,
adipogenic, neurogenic, myogenic and chondrogenic lineages,
co-culture with these cells may be a useful model in characterizing
their differentiation property into cells of a specific lineage.
Furthermore, this 3D spheroid model, combined with microfluidic

technology, may be used for drug-screening or high throughput
hepatotoxicity tests.
Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed that the hADSCs in 3D spheroid co￾cultured with hHeps assist the compact formation of hepatic
spheroids in concave microwell arrays and behave like hepato￾cytes. The co-cultured spheroids might facillitate a more efficient,
easier, and safer method than whole organ transplantation to cure
patients suffering from end-stage liver disease, overcoming the
shortage of donor hHeps. In addition, they could be used in the
extracorporeal bioartificial liver maintaining stable cell viability
and functions. However, further in vitro and in vivo studies are
needed to achieve a better understanding of the potential benefits
and risks of cell-based therapeutic usage in clinical settings.
