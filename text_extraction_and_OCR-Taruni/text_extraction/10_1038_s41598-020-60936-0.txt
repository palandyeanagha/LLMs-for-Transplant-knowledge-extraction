Infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality early after liver transplantation. The 
aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to evaluate clinical utility of c-reactive protein (CRP), 
procalcitonin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in surveillance of infections early after liver 
transplantation in intensive care setting. A total of 60 liver transplant recipients were included. CRP, 
procalcitonin, and NLR assessed at 12-hour intervals were primary variables of interest. Infections and 
severe complications during postoperative intensive care unit stay were the primary and secondary 
end-points, respectively. Infections and severe complications were diagnosed in 9 and 17 patients, 
respectively. Only peak CRP beyond first 48hours was associated with infections (p=0.038) with AUC, 
positive and negative predictive value of 0.728, 42.9% and 92.2%, respectively (cut-off: 142.7mg/L). 
Peak procalcitonin over first 60hours was the earliest predictor (p=0.050) of severe complications 
with AUC, positive and negative predictive value of 0.640, 53.3% and 80.0%, respectively (cut-off: 
42.8ng/mL). In conclusion, while CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR cannot be used for accurate diagnosis of 
infections immediately after liver transplantation, peak CRP beyond 48hours and peak procalcitonin 
over first 60hours may be used for initial exclusion of infections and prediction of severe complications, 
respectively.
Despite remarkable improvement of outcomes of patients after liver transplantation over past decades, infections 
remain one of the most important threats and most common causes of death in a population of liver transplant 
recipients1–3
. In the early post-transplant period, they are the most common cause of morbidity4
. Even 70% of liver 
transplant recipients develop bacterial infections, with vast majority occurring during the first post-transplant 
month5,6
. These complications remain an important cause of death in the early post-transplant period with 
overall infection-related mortality rates varying between 0–30% depending on etiology, timing, and site7–10. 
Particularly high mortality rates, in the range of approximately 35–70%, are reported for patients developing 
infections with multiple drug resistant microorganisms, such as extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing 
or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae11–13. Improvements in prevention, early diagnosis and management 
of infections in the early period after liver transplantation are thus undoubtedly necessary to further improve 
patient outcomes. Several preventive measures, such as perioperative use of probiotics or implementation of 
bundled strategies, were recently proven effective in major reduction of post-transplant burden of infections14–16. 
However, early diagnosis of infectious complications after liver transplantation, a prerequisite for timely initiation 
of antimicrobial therapy, remains a major clinical challenge, particularly in the immediate postoperative period17.
Serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) are well-established markers of systemic inflammation utilized for diagnosing postoperative infectious 
episodes in a non-transplant setting, particularly after colorectal operations18–25. The results of these common

laboratory tests in the early period after liver transplantation may be subject to the overlapping effects of patient 
pre-transplant status, operative injury, allograft function, post-transplant immunosuppression and occurrence of 
non-infectious complications. Although several reports focused on clinical utility of these inflammatory markers 
in liver transplant setting, data on their diagnostic accuracy, optimal cut-offs and factors influencing their changes 
in the first days after liver transplantation in an intensive care unit are scarce26,27. As these information are crucial 
for appropriate interpretation of their results, the aim of this study was (i) to evaluate the clinical applicability of 
procalcitonin, CRP, and NLR in diagnosis of postoperative infections in the first days after liver transplantation in 
the intensive care unit and (ii) to assess factors influencing their changes.
Methods
This was a prospective longitudinal study including 60 consecutive patients after first deceased donor liver trans￾plantation in the Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery at the Medical University of Warsaw 
between November 2015 and April 2016. Inclusion criteria comprised age over 18 years and provision of 
informed consent. Patients with a history of previous liver transplantation were excluded. All participants pro￾vided informed consent prior to enrollment to the study. The study protocol was approved by the institutional 
review board of the Medical University of Warsaw (KB/193/2015). All methods were performed in accordance 
with the relevant guidelines and regulations. No organs were procured from prisoners. All organs were procured 
by the transplant team of the Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery of the Medical University of 
Warsaw.
Bacterial and fungal infections occurring during patient postoperative stay in intensive surgical care unit were 
the primary end-point. They were defined and classified according to Centers for Disease Control guidelines 
for diagnosing healthcare-associated infections in the acute care setting28. Causative microorganisms, clinical 
management and outcome were recorded. Severe postoperative complications, defined as grade ≥3 according 
to Clavien-Dindo classification, were set as a secondary end-point29. Early allograft dysfunction was diagnosed 
using criteria proposed by Olthoff et al.
30. Follow-up for the occurrence of clinical end-points was limited to 
patient stay in the intensive care unit.
Procalcitonin, CRP, and NLR assessed at 12-hour intervals during patient postoperative stay in the intensive 
surgical care unit were recorded as primary factors of interest. Postoperative changes of these parameters over the 
first 5 postoperative days were compared between patients with and without infectious complications, with and 
without severe postoperative complications, and with and without early allograft dysfunction. Regarding these 
comparisons, only infections and severe complications occurring during first 5 postoperative days were consid￾ered. Irrespective of the presence of significant differences between particular subgroups, a series of additional 
variables representing CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR changes were created in an exploratory fashion basing on 
evaluation of their five-day kinetics and assessed as predictors of infections and severe morbidity. Pre-transplant, 
intraoperative, donor, and postoperative factors were subsequently evaluated for significant influence on post￾operative changes of the three inflammation markers. Postoperative laboratory results other than CRP, procal￾citonin, and NLR were included in these analyses basing on correlations with these inflammation markers and 
following transformation to single variables.
The protocol of standard antimicrobial prophylaxis included intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam for three 
days and fluconazole for seven days. In patients colonized with gram-negative extended-spectrum beta-lactamase 
producing pathogens, perioperative prophylaxis was based on imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin. Immediately 
after the operation patients were transferred to intensive surgical care unit. Immunosuppression protocol was 
based on combinations of steroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Basiliximab was applied for induction 
immunosuppression in selected patients basing on clinical indications. The choice over use of induction immu￾nosuppression was made at the discretion of the consulting hepatologist, yet generally, at the time of study basilix￾imab was not preferred in patients with alcoholic liver disease or autoimmune-related liver disease. Peripheral 
and central catheter blood cultures were routinely performed 24 and 48 hours post transplantation. All grafts 
were procured from donors after brain death. Transplantations were performed either with piggyback technique 
and side-to-side caval anastomosis or with conventional technique and two end-to-end caval anastomoses. 
Temporary extracorporeal veno-venous circulation was used during conventional procedures. Other details on 
perioperative care and surgical technique were provided elsewhere31,32.
Data were presented as medians with interquartile ranges or frequencies with percentages for quantitative 
and qualitative variables, respectively. General linear models for repeated measurements were used to evaluate 
postoperative changes of inflammatory markers. Multivariable analyses included only factors with significant 
intergroup effects on univariable analyses with final model created using backward elimination method (p > 0.05 
applied for exclusion of variables). Missing variables were imputed with median values. Logistic regression mod￾els were used to evaluate associations between single factors representing CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR changes 
and occurrence of infections and severe postoperative complications. Receiver operating characteristics analyses 
were applied for establishment of optimal cut-offs based on Youden index. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predic￾tive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Correlations between laboratory values in 
the postoperative period were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficient. Bonferroni correction was applied 
to manage multiple comparisons in these analyses. Changes of inflammation markers in the postoperative period 
were presented as least squares means with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Odds ratios (ORs) and areas 
under the curves (AUCs) were presented with 95% CIs. The level of significance was set to two-sided p < 0.05. All 
analyses were computed using STATISTICA 13 (Dell Inc., OK, USA) software.

Results
Basic characteristics of the study cohort are presented in Table 1. Overall, nine patients (15.0%) developed infec￾tions during early post-operative intensive care unit stay, including: pneumonia in seven patients (11.7%, two 
with concomitant secondary bloodstream infection) and other lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract 
infection, and surgical site infection, each in one patient. Eight of those nine patients developed infections within 
the first five postoperative days. Severe postoperative complications occurred in 17 patients (28.3%) and early 
allograft dysfunction occurred also in 17 patients (28.3%). All severe complications occurred over the first 5 
postoperative days and included renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (n=5; 8.0%), respiratory 
failure requiring mechanical ventilation (n=5; 8.0%), pharyngeal bleeding managed with tamponade (n=4; 
6.6%), intraabdominal bleeding managed surgically (n=3; 5.0%), circulatory failure (n=3; 5.0%), hepatic artery 
thrombosis managed with retransplantation (n=2; 3.3%), pneumothorax managed with thoracic drainage (n=1;

1.6%), hydrothorax managed with pleurocentesis (n=1; 1.6%), primary graft non-function (n=1; 1.6%), and 
outflow obstruction syndrome requiring rentransplantation (n=1; 1.6%).
There was a sharp rise of CRP in the first 24hours post-transplantation with subsequent decline and plateau 
phase after 48hours (p < 0.001; Fig. 1A). Procalcitonin changes were characterized by a sharp rise over the first 
36 hours and subsequent decline (p < 0.001; Fig. 1B). NLR increased immediately following transplantation, 
remained stable for 36–48hours and then gradually declined (p < 0.001; Fig. 1C). There were no significant dif￾ferences in CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR over 5 post-transplant days depending on the occurrence of infections 
(Fig. 2A–C). Patients with severe postoperative complications exhibited second increase of CRP beyond 48 hours 
(interaction effect: p=0.043; Fig. 2D), higher procalcitonin with more dynamic changes in the entire analyzed 
period (group effect: p=0.028; interaction effect: p=0.012; Fig. 2E), and a lack of NLR decline (interaction effect: 
p=0.018; Fig. 2F). No significant differences in these inflammation markers were observed depending on the 
occurrence of EAD (Fig. 3).
A series of additional variables representing CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR values was created. Of those rep￾resenting CRP changes, only peak CRP concentration beyond first 48 postoperative hours was significantly

CI 0.538–0.918), sensitivity of 42.9%, specificity of 92.2%, PPV of 42.9% and NPV of 92.2% (Fig. 4). None of 
procalcitonin- or NLR-based variables was significantly associated with the occurrence of infections.
Occurrence of severe postoperative complications was significantly associated with peak CRP beyond first 
48 hours (p=0.016), difference between peak CRP beyond and within first 48hours (p=0.007), and peak pro￾calcitonin over first 60hours (p=0.050; Table 3). As peak procalcitonin in general was identical to peak procalci￾tonin within first 60hours, it was disregarded in further analyses. The optimal cut-off for peak CRP beyond first 
48 hours was 71.6 mg/L with an AUC of 0.677 (95% CI 0.507–0.847), sensitivity of 62.5%, specificity of 76.2%, 
PPV of 50.0% and NPV of 84.2% (Fig. 5A). The optimal cut-off for difference between peak CRP beyond and

The only factor associated with CRP changes was the presence of alcoholic liver disease (p=0.038; Table 4). 
Factors independently associated with procalcitonin changes comprised recipient body mass index (p=0.049), 
intraoperative packed red blood cells transfusions (p=0.002), peak creatinine concentration on post-transplant 
days 2–5 (p=0.034), intraoperative dialysis (p=0.011), and donor infection (p < 0.001). Factors independently 
associated with NLR changes comprised duration of anhepatic phase (p < 0.001), peak alanine transaminase 
activity on day two (p < 0.001), and presence of autoimmune disease as indication for transplantation (p=0.011).
Discussion
Early diagnosis of infections after liver transplantation is a necessary prerequisite for timely initiation of anti￾microbial therapy, which increases the odds for favorable outcomes. Both CRP and procalcitonin are used for 
surveillance of postoperative infections after non-transplant operations. NLR, a well-established marker of sys￾temic inflammatory response, currently being investigated for that purpose. The present study indicates that CRP, 
procalcitonin, and NLR are not reliable markers for diagnosis of infectious complications in the immediate period 
after liver transplantation in an intensive care setting, yet CRP may be used for initially excluding the diagnosis 
of infectious complications.
Of the analyzed inflammatory markers, only peak CRP beyond first 48 postoperative hours was found to be 
significantly associated with infections. However, sensitivity and PPV rates below 50% indicate that it cannot 
be used for accurate diagnosis and its role is rather limited to identification of high risk patients. This seems to 
be its universal shortcoming, given that low PPVs are commonly reported for CRP in surveillance of infections 
also following non-transplant operations18,21,23. Due to relatively high NPV, it seems that CRP beyond first 
48 hours may be applied for initial exclusion of the diagnosis of infection. This findings partly correspond to 
the results of studies on patients undergoing non-transplant abdominal operations, in which CRP on post￾operative days three, four, and five were all associated with the development of infectious complications. In 
meta-analysis by Adamina et al. involving nearly two thousand patients undergoing various abdominal pro￾cedures, the highest AUC for CRP on days 3–5 was 0.76 with the highest specificity, sensitivity, PPV and NPV 
rates of 76%, 83%, 53% and 86%, respectively21. More recent meta-analysis focused on colorectal procedures 
revealed even higher AUCs for CRP on these days, ranging from 0.79 to 0.87 with the highest specificity, sen￾sitivity, PPV and NPV rates of 81%, 75%, 24%, and 98%, respectively18. Present study indicates that the use of 
CRP for surveillance of infections in the very early period after liver transplantation is characterized by similar 
AUC, similar specificity and NPV, similar or slightly higher PPV, but remarkably lower sensitivity. Therefore, 
an increased number of infectious complications may be missed using peak CRP beyond first 48 hours for 
excluding infections after liver transplantation than after non-transplant abdominal operations. This points 
towards a rather adjunct role of CRP in excluding the diagnosis of infectious complications early after liver

Interestingly, procalcitonin was not found useful for surveillance of infections immediately after liver trans￾plantation in an intensive care unit. Further, procalcitonin was remarkably, yet non-significantly lower in patients 
experiencing infectious episodes than in those without infections, particularly in the first two post-transplant 
days. This is contrary to the findings of studies performed in patients undergoing non-transplant operations, in 
whom peak procalcitonin in the early postoperative period was significantly associated with the development of 
infectious complications18–20,23. One of the potential reasons for a lack of clinical utility of procalcitonin for infec￾tion surveillance early after liver transplantation includes the multifactorial genesis of its post-transplant course. 
Factors influencing postoperative procalcitonin changes comprised those related to the preoperative recipient 
status (body mass index), intraoperative course (transfusions, the need for intraoperative dialysis), post-operative 
course (creatinine), and donor microbiological status. Procalcitonin may, however, be used to predict devel￾opment of severe postoperative complications considering remarkable differences observed as early as on the 
first postoperative measurement, performed within first 12 postoperative hours. This confirms previous findings 
from non-transplant setting for the field of liver transplantation33–35. Nevertheless, these differences also seem 
to derive from perioperative factors influencing its postoperative changes, such as the need for intraoperative 
dialysis or transfusion requirement, as they indicate altered course of the transplantation or more severely ill 
recipient. While both peak CRP beyond first 48hours and difference between peak CRP beyond and within first 
48hours were also significantly associated with severe morbidity with higher specificity and PPV of the latter, ear￾lier timing of peak concentration seems to be the most clinically important advantage of procalcitonin. Notably, 
the postoperative course of inflammation markers was not dependent on liver function.
The present study provides no evidence for clinical utility of NLR for surveillance of post-transplant infec￾tions. Although analysis of postoperative changes of NLR in patients with and without severe complications 
revealed a lack of decreasing slope in the former, the results of further analyses did not prove its clinical applica￾bility and thus, this observation seems only of scientific importance. As the factors independently associated with 
NLR changes comprised both duration of anhepatic phase and transaminase activity, it seems to be largely driven 
by ischemia-reperfusion injury. This novel finding is partly consistent with recent reports on the correspond￾ing association between increased NLR and small-for-size syndrome in living donor liver transplantations36,37. 
Significant influence of the presence of autoimmune disease on NLR was reported previously38.
Few studies on the relevance of inflammation markers in the early postoperative period were performed in 
a population of liver transplant recipients. In a study by Perrakis et al., fist peak of procalcitonin was not predic￾tive of complicated postoperative course and occurrence of second peak was significantly associated both with 
infectious and non-infectious complications39. Conversely, van den Broek et al. revealed significant association 
between first peak procalcitonin and development of clinically significant infections in an intensive care unit in 
a timeframe similar to that utilized in the present study, yet it was not an independent predictor of infections, 
in contrast to peak CRP26. According to a report by Eyraud et al., post-transplant procalcitonin was remarkably 
influenced by presence of infection in the donor and was not predictive of infections in the recipients, similar to 
the present study40. No differences in procalcitonin were also reported in the first week following pediatric liver 
transplantations depending on development of infections41. Occurrence of bacteriemia was found by Kaido et al. 
to be associated with differences in procalcitonin after liver transplantation, yet only beyond fifth postoperative 
day27. CRP cut-off of 52mg/L at 72 hours post-transplantation was proposed for initiation of antibiotic therapy 
and supported by a PPV of more than 70% with respect to infections42. However, despite nearly three-fold higher 
threshold for peak CRP established in the present study, PPV was only slightly above 40% thus indicating its far 
lower predictive ability than that reported previously.
The present study has several limitations. First, it is limited by the number of patients which increases the 
odds for type II error. However, multiple clinically and statistically significant associations of infections, severe 
morbidity and other variables with the course of inflammation markers were identified. Notably, the observation

period was limited to the earliest time after liver transplantation, which is reflected by predominant occurrence 
of respiratory tract infections and relatively low overall infection rate. Therefore, the results of this study may be 
interpreted only with respect to the period of first days after transplantation, which is consistent with the aims. 
Further, the follow-up period was also limited to patient stay in the intensive care unit, which is dependent on 
departments practice pattern. In this study, patients were discharged from the intensive care unit only in case of 
uneventful clinical course and consistent improvement of organ function. As the analyses were limited to imme￾diate postoperative period and performed on a limited number of patients, we were unable to provide informa￾tion on the association between the type of immunosuppression and the course of inflammatory markers in the 
postoperative period. However, such analyses would be subject to bias related to potential changes in immuno￾suppression in patients with suspected occurrence of infectious complications. Finally, peak procalcitonin and 
peak CRP concentrations beyond 48 hours did not always precede actual occurrence of severe complications 
and infections. However, this does not seem to preclude their use as additional markers in the decision-making 
process in doubtful cases.
In conclusion, CRP beyond first 48 postoperative hours may be used for initial exclusion of the presence of 
infectious complications after deceased donor liver transplantation. Both procalcitonin and NLR do not seem 
clinically useful for infection surveillance immediately after the procedure. Peak procalcitonin may be used for 
prediction of severe morbidity. CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR are not related to allograft function.
