Abstract
The adverse effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors in various organs may be attributed to immune-mediated processes
triggered by disrupted self-tolerance; however, it remains unclear whether they are similar or dissimilar to classic organ￾specific autoimmune diseases. The present study aimed to compare clinicopathologic features between checkpoint inhibitor￾induced liver injury and acutely presenting autoimmune hepatitis or idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury. Seven patients
treated with nivolumab (n = 5) or ipilimumab (n = 2) presented with liver dysfunction a median of 41 days (range 21–120)
after the initiation of immunotherapy. All patients had elevated liver enzymes, whereas hyper-bilirubinemia was less
common. None of the patients had antinuclear antibodies or IgG elevations. Stopping the immunotherapy and additional
immunosuppression with corticosteroids normalized or decreased liver enzymes in all patients treated. Histologically, all
biopsies showed predominantly lobular hepatitis with milder portal inflammation. Centrilobular confluent necrosis and
plasmacytosis were observed in a single case, and were markedly less common and milder than those in autoimmune
hepatitis (p = 0.017 and p < 0.001, respectively). Bile duct injury, micro-abscesses, and extramedullary hematopoiesis were
also found in one case each. Immunostaining revealed the presence of large numbers of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes,
whereas CD20+ B cells and CD4+ T cells were fewer in checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury than in autoimmune
hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury. In conclusion, liver injury caused by cancer immunotherapy shares some features with
injury of autoimmune hepatitis; however, there are obvious differences between the two conditions. Checkpoint inhibitor￾induced liver injury may represent an immune-mediated, less zone-selective hepatocyte necrosis not requiring the strong
activation of helper T cells and immunoglobulin production.
Introduction
Immunomodulation using immune checkpoint inhibitors has
become a promising approach for the treatment of various
malignant neoplasms [1, 2]. This emerging immunotherapy
was originally used for advanced malignant melanoma, but
has since been approved or is currently being tested in
clinical trials for many other malignancies including non￾small-cell lung cancers and renal cell carcinomas [3–8].
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are now the two most com￾monly used checkpoint inhibitors [2, 9, 10]. Nivolumab
recognizes programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), mainly
expressed by T lymphocytes, and blocks the interaction PD￾1 and its ligand, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expressed on cancer cells [1, 11]. The blockage of this
ligand–receptor interaction inhibits the inactivation of T
lymphocytes and enhances anticancer cytotoxic effects.
Ipilimumab targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated anti￾gen 4 (CTLA4) on the surface of T lymphocytes [11]. Since
the CTLA4 signal also inactivates lymphocytes, blocking
CTLA4 by ipilimumab enables T lymphocytes to exert their
cytotoxic effects on tumor cells [12]. Although PD-1 and
CTLA4 are mainly expressed by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells,
other lymphocytes including regulatory T cells and CD4+
T cells are also suggested to have these receptors [13–15].
Checkpoint inhibitors sometimes induce various adverse
effects including skin rashes, colitis, pancreatitis, nephritis,

and hepatitis [16, 17]. Based on the assumption that T-cell
inactivation by the PD-1 and CTLA4 pathways is also
involved in immune tolerance to self-antigens, adverse
effects may be triggered by autoimmune reactions. There￾fore, the side effects of checkpoint inhibitors are often
referred to as “immune-mediated adverse events” in order to
distinguish them from usual idiosyncratic drug-induced
organ damage [16]. Although liver injuries caused by nivo￾lumab and ipilimumab were originally suspected to resemble
classic autoimmune hepatitis [18], recent pathology papers
raised the possibility that clinicopathologic features of
immunotherapy-related hepatitis may not be identical to
those of autoimmune hepatitis [19, 20]. However, these two
conditions have not yet been systematically compared.
In the present study, the biopsy findings of liver injuries
caused by nivolumab or ipilimumab were compared with
classic autoimmune hepatitis and idiosyncratic drug￾induced liver injury in order to elucidate how checkpoint
inhibitor-induced liver injuries are similar or dissimilar to
the two other conditions.
Materials and methods
Patients
This study received ethical approval from Kobe University
Graduate School of Medicine. A search of the pathology
database at our institutes and consultation files of the
authors identified seven cases of liver injuries caused by
nivolumab (n = 5) and ipilimumab (n = 2). Five were
Japanese cases, while the remaining two were selected from
the database in Seattle. Electronically stored clinical records
and histology slides were retrospectively reviewed.
Ten cases each of autoimmune hepatitis and drug-induced
liver injury were also selected for comparison (Table 1).
Consecutive cases of autoimmune hepatitis that clinically
showed an acute presentation were chosen because liver
injuries due to checkpoint inhibitors were sudden-onset
hepatitis. All selected patients with autoimmune hepatitis
had >1:40 titers of antinuclear antibodies and IgG elevations
with clinicopathologic features meeting the criteria of defi￾nite autoimmune hepatitis based on the simplified scoring
system [21]. As for drug-induced liver injury, consecutive
cases of predominantly hepatitic injury were selected. All
cases of drug-induced liver injury were clinically determined
to be idiosyncratic and not due to drug overdose. Causative
drugs were antibiotics (n = 3), anti-inflammatory agents (n
= 3), anti-convulsants (n = 2), and herbal medicine (n = 2).
All patients with autoimmune hepatitis or drug-induced liver
injury were negative for viral markers, with cases of drug￾induced liver injury also lacking antinuclear antibodies.
Evaluation of liver biopsies
Liver biopsies were reviewed in terms of the following
findings: portal inflammation, lobular injury, confluent
necrosis, eosinophilic infiltration, and plasmacytosis. The
degrees of portal inflammation, lobular injury, and con￾fluent necrosis were examined according to Ishak’s scoring
system for chronic hepatitis [22]. Although interface hepa￾titis and fibrosis were also a part of Ishak’s scoring scheme,
they are rare in acute-onset liver diseases; therefore, these
findings were not examined in the present study. Although
Ishak’s scoring system is designed for chronic hepatitis, it
was selected in this study because this scheme allows to
evaluate multiple hepatitic findings in a semiquantitative
manner and also because of the lack of reliable scoring
systems for acute hepatitis. The presence or absence of >5
eosinophils per high power field and >10 plasma cells per
high power field was evaluated. Other features such as bile
duct injury were also recorded if present.
Immunohistochemistry
All biopsy specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin
and embedded in paraffin. Unstained slides for immuno￾histochemistry were available in five nivolumab-treated

cases and all cases of autoimmune hepatitis or drug￾induced liver injury. Immunostaining was performed on a
Ventana Benchmark XT (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.,
Tucson, AZ) or Bond Max autostainer (Leica Micro￾systems, Wetzlar, Germany) according to the manu￾facturers’ protocols. Deparaffinized sections were heat￾treated and incubated with primary antibodies. Immuno￾histochemical staining for multiple lymphocyte markers
was performed using the following antibodies: CD3
(clone F7.2.38, 1:50, Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Den￾mark), CD4 (clone 1F6, prediluted, Leica Microsystems),
CD8 (clone SP57, Roche, Ltd., Basel, Switzerland), and
CD20 (clone L26, prediluted, Dako Cytomation). The
numbers of lymphocytes positive for each marker were
counted at three hot spots and calculated as the average
per high power
field. Ratios of CD20

+ and CD4
+/CD8
+ cells were also calculated in each case.

Results
Clinical features
Clinical features are summarized in Table
2. The study
cohort consisted of
five men and two women with a median
age of 61 years (range 24
–76). Five and two patients
received nivolumab and ipilimumab monotherapy, respec￾tively, for the management of advanced malignant mela￾nomas (n = 6) or squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (n = 1). Patient 2 had a history of primary biliary cholangitis,
which had been treated with ursodeoxycholic acid for 13
years. Patient 5 was diagnosed as having rheumatoid
arthritis 3 years before, and was treated with methotrexate.
He was symptom-free without medication when immu￾notherapy for lingual cancer started.
Liver dysfunction was observed after the administration
of 1 to 6 doses of checkpoint inhibitors. Durations between
the initiation of immunotherapy and onset of liver dys￾function ranged between 21 and 120 days (median 41). All
patients presented with elevated liver enzymes. The seve￾rities and patterns of serological abnormalities varied
widely. Hyper-bilirubinemia was less common than ele￾vated liver enzymes (Table 2). All patients were negative
for antinuclear antibodies, and elevated IgG was also not
observed in any of the six cases tested. None had mani￾festations of checkpoint inhibitor-related injury in other

organs. Liver injuries required stopping the immunotherapy
and the initiation of corticosteroid therapy in all, but patient
4, for whom serological abnormalities improved by only
stopping the administration of nivolumab. Four patients
received steroid pulse (methylprednisolone 1,000 mg/day,
3 days), while patients 1 and 5 had prednisolone (30 and 50
mg/day) for 26 and 13 days, respectively (Table 2).
Although patient 7 continued to have mild serological liver
dysfunction after steroid pulse therapy, all other treated
patients showed good responses to the initial steroid ther￾apy. After serological improvement of liver dysfunction
was confirmed, corticosteroids were gradually tapered off in
the following 2 weeks to 7 months.
Liver biopsy findings
The microscopic findings of liver biopsies are summarized
in Table 3. All cases predominantly exhibited lobular
hepatitis with milder portal inflammation. Except for patient
5, lobular injury consisted of randomly scattered foci of
focal necrosis and acidophilic bodies with no confluent
necrosis (Fig. 1a, b). Patient 5 also had centrilobular zonal
necrosis (Fig. 1c). Focal aggregates of eosinophils (>5 cells/
high power field) were observed in two cases. Plasmacytic
infiltration was not conspicuous in any cases. Patient 5 had
>10 plasma cells per high power field, whereas the degree
of plasmacytosis was less than that expected in classic
autoimmune hepatitis. Both cases of ipilimumab-associated
liver injury had foci of macrophage aggregation; however,
this finding was not observed in nivolumab-treated cases.
No discrete granuloma was found in any cases.
Patient 1 also exhibited changes suggestive of large-duct
biliary injury, such as a ductular reaction, biliary-type
interface activity, and cholangiolitis (Fig. 1d). He did not
have any imaging features suggestive of metastatic mela￾noma involving the biliary tree. In patient 3, many micro￾abscesses were present in the parenchyma, but immunos￾taining for cytomegalovirus was negative (Fig. 1e). The
liver biopsy sample of patient 4 showed extramedullary
hematopoiesis, suggesting bone marrow injury (Fig. 1f).
Further clinical evaluations with a bone marrow biopsy
eventually identified bone marrow involvement in malig￾nant melanoma. Patient 2 with known primary biliary
cholangitis showed the features of chronic cholangiopathy
such as bile duct injury, early ductopenia, and copper￾associated protein deposition, the overall portal tract chan￾ges consistent with primary biliary cholangitis stage 3.

associated with confluent necrosis of variable degrees.
Although the remaining case of autoimmune hepatitis
clinically presented with acute illness, the histology of the
liver biopsy sample was active lobular hepatitis with dense
portal inflammation and interface hepatitis, suggesting the
acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis. All cases of drug￾induced liver injury also showed predominantly lobular
inflammation with or without confluent necrosis.
The histologic features of immune checkpoint inhibitor￾associated liver injury were compared with those of auto￾immune hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury (Fig. 2). The
degrees of portal inflammation and lobular injury did not
significantly differ among the three disorders. Confluent
necrosis in checkpoint inhibitor-associated liver injury was
less common and milder than that in autoimmune hepatitis (p
= 0.017) and drug-induced liver injury (p = 0.070). Eosino￾philic infiltration was also less common in immunotherapy￾triggered hepatitis than in drug-induced liver injury (p =
0.034). Plasmacytosis was always observed in autoimmune
hepatitis, but in only 2/7 (29%) cases of checkpoint inhibitor￾associated liver injury (p < 0.001). Bile plugs were slightly
more common in drug-induced liver injury than in checkpoint
inhibitor-induced liver injury (p = 0.056). Hepatocellular
rosettes and emperipolesis were observed in 4/10 (40%) and
8/10 (80%) cases of autoimmune hepatitis, but none of
immunotherapy-related liver injury (p = 0.056 and 0.001,
respectively). Multinucleated hepatocytes were present in 8/
10 (80%) cases of autoimmune hepatitis and 3/7 (43%) cases
of checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (p = 0.115).
Small discrete granulomas were found in a case of drug￾induced liver injury but none of immunotherapy-related liver
disease (p = 0.853).
Characterization of infiltrating lymphocytes
The results of immunohistochemistry are summarized in
Fig. 3. Checkpoint inhibitor-associated liver injury was
characterized by the infiltration of predominantly CD3+
and CD8+ lymphocytes, while fewer CD20+ or CD4+
lymphocytes were detected (Fig. 4).

A comparison between checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver
injury and autoimmune hepatitis revealed that the number of
CD20+, CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+ lymphocytes was smaller
in checkpoint inhibitor-associated hepatitis than in auto￾immune hepatitis. This trend was particularly obvious for
CD20+ or CD4+ lymphocytes (both p = 0.003). Therefore,
CD20+/CD3+ and CD4+/CD8+ cell ratios in checkpoint
inhibitor-induced liver injury were also markedly lower than
those in autoimmune hepatitis (p = 0.008 and p = 0.003,
respectively). In autoimmune hepatitis, CD20+ or CD4+
were predominantly present in enlarged portal tracts and
periportal parenchyma (Fig. 5). Although all cases of auto￾immune hepatitis showed an acute clinical presentation,
small lymphoid aggregates containing CD20+ lymphocytes
were observed in some portal tracts.
The difference between checkpoint inhibitor-associated
liver injury and drug-induced liver injury was less con￾spicuous. However, the number of CD20+ and CD4+
lymphocytes in checkpoint inhibitor-related liver disease
was even smaller than that in drug-induced liver injury (p =
0.017 and p = 0.003, respectively).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical and
pathologic study systematically comparing checkpoint
inhibitor-induced liver injury with autoimmune hepatitis
and drug-induced liver injury. In addition, although a few
case reports described liver biopsy findings of nivolmab￾related liver damage [23], this is the first case series with in￾depth histopathological analyses. In contrast, three previous
studies examined the histopathologic features of
ipilimumab-related hepatitis [18–20]. Among the 18
reported cases of ipilimumab-related hepatitis with detailed
histopathologic features available, 16 showed lobular
hepatitis, with six also being associated with confluent
necrosis [18–20]. The overall pattern of liver injuries
appeared to be similar between ipilimumab- and nivolumab￾induced hepatitis, whereas confluent necrosis may be less
common in the latter. Seven reported cases of ipilimumab￾induced hepatitis also had conspicuous histiocytes in sinu￾soids, with some forming granuloma-like aggregates [19,
20]. That finding was also observed in both ipilimumab￾treated cases in our cohort, suggesting that histiocytes are
activated more in ipilimumab-induced liver injury.
The present study identified similarities and dissim￾ilarities between checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury
and classic autoimmune hepatitis. Similar to most cases of
acutely presenting autoimmune hepatitis, liver injury caused
by checkpoint inhibitors exhibited lobular hepatitis with
milder portal inflammation. Both conditions had many
infiltrating T-lymphocytes positive for CD3 or CD8.
Although low-grade liver dysfunction remained after steroid

pulse therapy in one case, immunosuppression with corti￾costeroids appeared to be effective. These results support
checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury being an immune￾mediated process.
However, differences between the two conditions were
more obvious. Unlike cases of autoimmune hepatitis, all
patients with checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury
lacked antinuclear antibodies and IgG elevations. Histologic
findings also differed in several aspects, with plasmacytosis
and centrilobular confluent necrosis being uncommon in
checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver damage. On immunos￾taining, liver injury caused by immunotherapy was

associated with markedly smaller numbers of CD20+ or
CD4+ lymphocytes than autoimmune hepatitis. Differences
in lymphocyte subsets may be expected because PD-1 and
CTLA4 are mainly expressed by CD8+ cytotoxic T￾lymphocytes. Therefore, the interaction between CD4+
helper T cells and B cells may be activated less in
immunotherapy-associated liver injury than in autoimmune
hepatitis, which may be a reason why serum IgG levels
were not elevated in this condition. This may also explain
why, in contrast to autoimmune hepatitis, immunosuppres￾sion can be discontinued by tapering over 1 or 2 months in
most patients with the hepatotoxicity of checkpoint inhibi￾tors [24].
An interesting result was that confluent necrosis was rare
in checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury, particularly
nivolumab-treated cases. Zonal cell loss is common in
autoimmune hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury, and
typically occurs in perivenular areas. The mechanisms
underlying centrilobular hepatocyte dropout have not yet
been clarified; however, heterogeneity in expressed proteins
and enzymatic activities among zones may explain this
microscopic change. Cytochrome P450 isoforms involved
in phase I drug metabolism are strongly expressed or pre￾ferentially induced in the perivenular region, while glu￾tathione peroxidase, a phase II enzyme, displays an
opposite, periportally dominated pattern [25, 26]. Therefore,
proteins, enzymes, and metabolites that are more abun￾dantly present in zone 3 hepatocytes may behave as a
hepatotoxin or autoantigen triggering immune reactions in
autoimmune hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury. The
uncommon development of confluent necrosis in check￾point inhibitor-induced liver injury suggests that the liver
damage may represent a less zone-selective hepatocyte
necrosis not requiring the strong activation of CD4+ T￾lymphocytes and immunoglobulin production. Since peri￾venular areas are the most peripheral from a blood flow
perspective, ischemia is another factor potentially con￾tributing to zonal necrosis, and it may be a major
mechanism of zonal necrosis observed, although rarely, in
checkpoint inhibitor-associated liver injury.
The present study also elucidated minor histologic findings
in checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury. Patient 1 showed
features suggestive of large-duct injury including a ductular
reaction and biliary-type interface activity. That case may
have had additional cholangitis in the large-duct because a
few recent studies suggested that nivolumab induces cho￾langiopathy [27, 28]. In patient 3, ~ 20 foci of micro￾abscesses were observed in the core of liver tissue. Micro￾abscesses in liver biopsy samples generally indicate the pos￾sibility of infection. However, this may not have been the case
in our patient because she responded well to steroid pulse
therapy. Therefore, the cause of micro-abscesses remains
unclear. A recent study reported fibrin ring granulomas in two
patients treated with a combination of ipilimumab and nivo￾lumab for malignant melanoma [29]. Although this was not
detected in our cases, the unusual form of granuloma is
another minor microscopic finding potentially observed in
checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury.
In conclusion, checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury
was predominantly characterized by lobular hepatitis with

the infiltration of many CD3+ or CD8+ T-lymphocytes,
consistent with an immune-mediated process. However,
unlike classic autoimmune hepatitis, serological auto￾immune abnormalities (e.g., antinuclear antibodies and IgG
elevations), centrilobular zonal necrosis, and plasmacytosis
were uncommon. Based on the small numbers of CD4+
T cells and CD20+ B cells, checkpoint inhibitor-induced
liver injury may represent less zone-selective hepatocyte
necrosis not requiring the strong activation of helper T cells
and immunoglobulin production.
