Abstract
Background: Injecting drug use is a key risk factor, for several infections of public health
importance, especially hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV). In England and Wales, where less
than 1% of the population are likely to be injecting drug users (IDUs), approximately 38% of
laboratory reports of HBV, and 95% of HCV reports are attributed to injecting drug use.
Methods: Voluntary unlinked anonymous surveys have been performed on IDUs in contact with
specialist agencies throughout England and Wales. Since 1990 more than 20,000 saliva samples from
current IDUs have been tested for markers of infection for HBV, HCV testing has been included
since 1998. The analysis here considers those IDUs tested for HBV and HCV (n = 5,682) from
1998–2003. This study derives maximum likelihood estimates of the force of infection (the rate at
which susceptible IDUs acquire infection) for HBV and HCV in the IDU population and their trends
over time and injecting career length. The presence of individual heterogeneity of risk behaviour
and background HBV prevalence due to routes of transmission other than injecting are also
considered.
Results: For both HBV and HCV, IDUs are at greatest risk from infection in their first year of
injecting (Forces of infection in new initiates 1999–2003: HBV = 0.1076 95% C.I: 0.0840–0.1327
HCV = 0.1608 95% C.I: 0.1314–0.1942) compared to experienced IDUs (Force of infection in
experienced IDUs 1999–2003: HBV = 0.0353 95% C.I: 0.0198–0.0596, HCV = 0.0526 95% C.I:
0.0310–0.0863) although independently of this there is evidence of heterogeneity of risk behaviour
with a small number of IDUs at increased risk of infection. No trends in the FOI over time were
detected. There was only limited evidence of background HBV infection due to factors other than
injecting.
Conclusion: The models highlight the need to increase interventions that target new initiates to
injecting to reduce the transmission of blood-borne viruses. Although from the evidence here,
identification of those individuals that engage in heightened at-risk behaviour may also help in
planning effective interventions. The data and methods described here may provide a baseline for
monitoring the success of public health interventions.

Background
Injecting drug use is a key risk factor, and injecting drug
users (IDUs) are a core group for several infections of pub￾lic health importance, especially hepatitis B (HBV) and
hepatitis C (HCV). In England and Wales, where less than
1% of the population are likely to be IDUs [1], approxi￾mately 38% of laboratory reports of HBV [2], and 95% of
HCV reports[2] are attributed to injecting drug use.
A key measure of transmission within a given population
is the force of infection (FOI). This is defined as the
instantaneous per capita rate at which susceptibles acquire
infection and reflects the degree of contact with potential
for transmission between susceptibles and infecteds[3].
The aim of this study is to estimate FOI for HBV and HCV
in the IDU population in England and Wales and how this
may have evolved, both over time and as IDUs' injecting
careers progress.
Analysis that includes only a single infection can estimate
the mean FOI but not the variance. A model is proposed
here that considers HBV and HCV simultaneously and fits
to observed data on the prevalence of these infections
from a survey of IDUs with markers of single and multiple
infections. The effects of individual heterogeneity within
the IDU population are investigated, while the proposed
model also considers the transmission of HBV infection in
IDUs from non-IDUs.
Methods
Data
Since 1990, voluntary unlinked anonymous (UA) oral
fluid samples have been collected from injecting drug
users in contact with specialist agencies throughout Eng￾land and Wales [4,5]. These agencies provide services
including needle exchange, methadone maintenance and
outreach work. Behavioral information is collected
through a brief anonymous questionnaire unlinked from
client identifying information. The fields used in this
analysis were: Year Surveyed, age at first injection, age
when surveyed, injected in the last 4 weeks, ever vacci￾nated against HBV, and the number of doses of HBV vac￾cine received.
Oral fluid samples were tested for antibody to HBV (anti￾HBc) and from 1998; HCV. The sensitivity and specificity
of the test for anti-HBc was 75% and 100% respectively,
and 83% and 100% respectively for anti-HCV [6].
IDUs were included in this analysis if they reported hav￾ing injected in the four weeks prior to being surveyed.
Samples from 1990 to 1997 were not tested for HCV and
so were excluded leaving six complete consecutive surveys
1998–2003 containing 12,826 records of current IDUs.
Only IDUs with an unequivocal result for both tests were
included in this analysis (leaving 12,814 records). The
data were further constrained by limiting the current age
range at the time of the survey to between 16–49 years,
and the age of first injection to be from 13–45 years
(12,031 records). As the FOI considers the rate that sus￾ceptibles acquire infection only those persons that were
unvaccinated against HBV were considered in this analy￾sis. (Unvaccinated IDUs were defined as those that answer
no to the question of having been vaccinated against HBV
and report having received no doses of HBV vaccine)
(6,269 records). The percentage of the population with
anti-HBc, anti-HCV, and dual infection with variation in
injecting career length and over time is shown in Figure 1.
An injecting career length of each IDU was calculated
from this data by considering the difference between the
current age and the age of first injecting. Due to paucity of
data, those IDUs with an injecting career length of 20

years or more were omitted from this analysis, leaving
5,682 reports from IDUs to be considered here. The
impact of changing this cut-off was considered during sen￾sitivity analysis.
Model
The status of each IDU is considered with respect to both
infections. To introduce individual heterogeneity of at￾risk behaviour into the model we introduce a frailty Z
which represents an individual's relative rate of infection.
An individual of frailty Z and career length τ at time t has
the risk of previous HBV infection and
 of previous HCV infection. The frailty distri￾bution is assumed gamma with shape θ and scale param￾eter = 1.
For infection acquired through injecting drug use only, let
π00(τ, t), πB0(τ, t), π0C(τ, t) and πBC(τ, t) denote the propor￾tion of IDUs in year t with an injecting career length of τ
that are; uninfected, infected by HBV not HCV, infected by
HCV not HBV, and both HBV and HCV respectively. Then
πBC(τ, t) = 1 - π00(τ, t) - πB0(τ, t) - π0C(τ, t)
where:
ΛB(τ, t) and ΛC(τ, t) are the cumulative force of infection
for HBV and HCV respectively in year t for injecting career
length τ.
These equations represent a reparameterisation of Far￾rington's [7] formulation so that the total prevalence of
each infection is independent of θ (see Appendix 2).
HBV background prevalence and test sensitivity
Background HBV prevalence is included in the model and
reflects the possibility of transmission of HBV from out￾side the IDU population. As 95% of reports with exposure
data to HCV indicate injecting drug use [2], it has been
assumed here that there was no non-injecting related
transmission of HCV. To incorporate HBV background
prevalence and the sensitivity of the HBV and HCV tests
into this model the equations describing the prevalence of
the two viruses πxy(τ, t)have been modified to both reflect
the possibility that HBV infection can occur for reasons
other than injecting and that the tests for HBV and HCV
have a sensitivity and specificity that is less than 100%. It
is assumed in this model that the risk of background HBV
infection is constant through time and injecting career
length, and that there is no possibility of background
infection from HCV.
P0y = π0y(1 - b)
PBy = πBy + π0yb
and
V00 = P00 + (1 - sB)PB0 + (1 - sC)P0C+ (1 - sB) (1 - sC)PBC
VB0 = PB0sB + sB(1 - sC)PBC
V0C = P0CsC + sC(1 - sB)PBC
VBC = sBsC PBC
where
b = background prevalence of infection of HBV.
sB = sensitivity of the HBV test
sC = sensitivity of the HCV test
Pxy = proportion of IDUs in year t with an injecting career
length of τ with status xy allowing for the background
prevalence of infection of HBV.
Vxy = proportion of IDUs in year t with an injecting career
length of τ who have test status xy (allowing for the sensi￾tivity of the HBV and HCV tests)
Parameterisation
The cumulative FOI in 1998 (the first year of data consid￾ered here for each virus) by injecting career length,
Λ(1998, τ) is described by the function f(τ). This is
described by a four parameter logistic function.
The cumulative FOI in 1998 describes all infection in pre￾vious years and is estimated with the FOI for the more
recent years (1999–2003). No attempt has been made to
reduce the parameters describing this function with the
priority being to ensure sufficient flexibility and a good fit
to the data.
The force of infection from 1999 onwards is modelled as
the product of a function describing its trend over time

g(t) and a function describing its trend with injecting
career length h(τ) [8]:
λ (t, τ) = g(t)h(τ)
To standardize results for each virus, h(0) is fixed equal to
1. Both g(t) and h(τ) are parameterized on piecewise con￾stant functions
The initial model used at the start of the analysis is defined
as describing function f(τ) for each virus with a four
parameter logistic function (8 parameters), and functions
g(t) and h(τ) for each virus are described by an individual
value for each year 1999–2003 (10 parameters) and
injecting career length 1–19 years respectively (38 param￾eters). Along with the parameters; frailty θ and HBV back￾ground prevalence b, this leads to the initial model being
described by 58 parameters.
It is assumed that IDUs who report an injecting career
length of 0 years have been injecting for an average of 6
months (see Appendix). IDUs who appear in the UA sur￾veys such as those considered here, are recruited from
those in contact with services. The probability of being in
contact with services increases with injecting career
length[9] and therefore the average career length of sur￾veyed new initiates may be higher than the 6 months
assumed. Because the estimated FOI in new initiates will
be correlated with the duration of exposure (injecting
career length) we investigate the sensitivity of our esti￾mates to the career length assumed. As an extreme case, it
is assumed that IDUs with a reported injecting career
length of 0 years have been injecting for 12 months, while
applying the injecting career length of the remaining IDUs
at reported levels.
Model fitting
If nxy(τ, t) denotes the number of individuals in year t with
injecting career length τ with test results coded xy as
above, the log-likelihood (L) is the product multinomial.
Beginning with an initial model and then maintaining the
four parameter logistic function for f(τ), backwards-step￾wise elimination was used to reduce the number of
parameters describing g(t) and h(τ). Models were com￾pared using the analysis of deviance with the Chi-squared
test, the criteria for dropping parameters being that p >
0.05. When the parsimonious model (the best fitting
model with the fewest parameters) had been identified,
confidence intervals were calculated using profile likeli￾hood. For both functions g(t) and h(τ) a range of alterna￾tive reduced models were considered including alternative
values for the fixed category of h(0) e.g. 0 years 0–1 years,
0–2 years etc. A Selection of the reduced models examined
during the backwards-stepwise elimination process is
described in the following (only changes from the initial
model are noted):
1. Initial model
2 h(τ) for each virus is grouped into 4 injecting career
length groups (1–2 yrs, 3–4 yrs, 5–9 yrs, 10+yrs, 0 yrs is
fixed)
3 As model 2 above, except h(τ) is the same for each virus.
4 As model 3 above, except h(τ) is described by 1 injecting
career length group (1+ years, 0 yrs is fixed)
5 As model 4 above, except g(t) for each virus is a single
parameter (1999–2003).
6 As model 5 above, except function h(τ) = 1.
Results
The calculated model parameters for the parsimonious
model are shown in Table 1 with 95% confidence inter￾vals. The results from the model suggest that HBV back￾ground prevalence is low (= 0.00, 95% C.I: 0–0.0161).
Table 2 shows a summary of the results of the fitting pro￾cedure. The initial model gave a good fit to the data and
successive reducing in the number of parameters in mod￾els 2–5 did not significantly worsen the fit. Model 6 con￾sidered the impact of removing the function h(τ),
however this provided a significantly less good fit than
Model 5 (p < 0.001). Model 5, therefore, was taken to be
the parsimonious model.
Figure 2 shows the estimated FOI by injecting career
length for HBV and HCV. The parameter values for the
parsimonious model are shown in Table 2, while the
model fit to data for each survey is shown in Figure 3.
Across similar injecting career lengths the FOI was found
to be higher for HCV than HBV. For both HBV and HCV
the FOI is higher for new initiates to injecting (injecting
career length <1 year) (Figure 2) compared to experienced
IDUs.
The model fit to data for HCV and HBV in 1998 is shown
in Figure 4. The close fit of the model to the data provides
additional confidence in the selection of the four parame￾ter logistic function to describe function f(τ).
The estimated frailty distribution for the IDU population
is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that there is strong evi￾dence of individual heterogeneity, with the majority of

IDUs (64%) having a FOI less than the average (relative
risk<1), and a small proportion (15%) having a FOI much
higher than average (relative risk >2).
To investigate the impact of excluding those IDUs with an
injecting career length of 20 years or greater, a further
reduction was made with IDUs with an injecting career
length of greater than 10 years being excluded from the
analysis. However model results were found to be similar
(not shown) thereby suggesting no good reason to further
reduce the number of IDUs included in this analysis.
The importance of considering the test sensitivity for HBV
and HCV in the model was shown when these are
excluded from the model. The resultant force of infection
estimates for both HBV and HCV were found to be lower
than when test sensitivity is included in the model (results
not shown). It has been assumed that all new initiates to
injecting (injecting career length = 0 yrs) have been inject￾ing for an average six months. However if instead it is
assumed that all IDUs in the surveys have been injecting
for at least 1 year, then this lessens (but does not remove)
some of the injecting career length effect on the FOI
(h(1+) = 0.5704, 95% C.I: 0.4471–0.7801) although as
before the strong evidence of individual heterogeneity
remains (θ = 0.6547, 95% C.I: 0.5301–0.8208).
Discussion
Unlinked Anonymous data collected from IDUs in Eng￾land and Wales was analysed to estimate the trend in the
force of infection (FOI) for HBV and HCV in IDUs over
time and career length. By considering both viruses
together we assessed the heterogeneity of risk within the
IDU population and the effect of background HBV trans￾mission due to transmission between IDUs and non￾IDUs.
The IDUs recruited into the survey are self-selected and in
contact with specialist agencies and may not be represent￾ative of the whole IDU population. It has been shown that
HCV prevalence tends to be higher among IDU recruited
from treatment sites, though generally after adjustment
for age and injecting career any difference is substantially
reduced[10]. It has been established that the time between
onset and presentation to treatment varies, and that some
IDU will never enter treatment[11]. Thus, an important
potential bias arises if injectors in treatment and sampled
by the survey are different with respect to occurrence of
HCV and HBV[12] when compared to the overall IDU

population. For example if there is a greater difference in
HCV prevalence among new initiates contacting and not
contacting services than among experienced IDUs, then
this will influence the estimated difference in FOI
between new and experienced IDUs compared to the
actual FOI in the overall IDU population. It has been
assumed that the risk behaviour in the surveyed IDU pop￾ulation considered here is the same as the IDU population
in England and Wales and additionally there is the same
likelihood of a positive or negative IDU being surveyed as
there would be in the IDU population in England and
Wales.
The model suggest that the FOI of HBV and HCV is up to
four times higher among new initiates (injecting career
length <1 year) than for IDUs with longer injecting
careers, a finding which is supported by previous stud￾ies[13,14]. In all cases it was found that there is increased
risk of infection in new initiates compared to experienced
IDUs. The scale of these findings must be approached
with caution as they are sensitive and dependent on infor￾mation about and from a small sub-group of IDUs (those
with injecting career lengths of less than 1 year). It has
been assumed that IDUs reporting an injecting career
length of 0 years (i.e. start age = current age), have an even
chance of their exact injecting career length being any￾thing from 0 days to 1 year. However this does not allow
for the delay from the initiation of injecting until coming
into contact with services. If it is assumed instead that all
current IDUs (including new initiates) in the surveys have
been injecting for at least one year, the injecting career
length effects are lessened with new initiates only having
FOI estimates for HBV and HCV up to twice as high as
experienced IDUs.
The model indicates considerable heterogeneity in the
FOI among the sample suggesting some IDUs are at signif￾icantly greater risk from infection from blood-borne
viruses within the larger IDU population. Analysis that
considers only a single infection cannot address the issue
of individual heterogeneity, or its effect on other esti￾mates. In such analysis the presence of high risk individu￾als within the IDU population would cause an apparently
higher FOI in IDUs with short injecting career lengths. We
find such a career length effect after allowing for individ￾ual heterogeneity. These results demonstrate the added
value of this combined analysis. From this data alone it is
impossible to draw any conclusions about the reasons for
this individual heterogeneity, although it could be due to
certain groups within the overall IDU population strati￾fied by ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sex, or other
demographic variables.
It is acknowledged that the prevalence of each virus within
the IDU population may be due to infection from outside
the IDU population particularly for HBV. However the
low prevalence of background HBV infection suggests that
the infection in the IDU population is primarily due to
contact between IDUs (needle sharing or sexual contact).
During this analysis we excluded those IDUs that reported
being vaccinated against HBV. This was done as their
inclusion would result in an underestimation in the FOI
estimates obtained for HBV. When individuals are diag￾nosed with HCV infection, due to complications associ￾ated with dual infection they should be vaccinated against
HBV [15]. A consequence of this is that some individuals
that are HCV positive and vaccinated against HBV were
excluded from this analysis. As the prevalence of HCV is
higher in those IDUs that are excluded from this analysis
(vaccinated against HBV) compared to those included (RR
= 1.15, 95% C.I: 1.09–1.21 adjusting for injecting career
length), the results here may underestimate the FOI in
IDUs for HCV. To overcome this and to allow a greater
number of IDUs to be included in the analysis, future
models should incorporate an HBV vaccination rate that
varies based on an IDU's HCV status, this will lead to a
greater number of IDUs being included in this analysis
(vaccinated and unvaccinated) and may help to remove
any bias in the FOI estimates obtained here. An additional
advantage of this is that an increase in the number of HCV
positive individuals included in this analysis may also
increase power to detect any changes in the FOI over time.
Future work could consider whether the results about
individual heterogeneity in terms of frailty could be com￾pared to data describing the heterogeneity of risk behav￾iour within the IDU population through injecting or
sharing behaviour. This would help to corroborate the
findings obtained here.

Conclusion
The estimation of the FOI from serial prevalence data pro￾vides added epidemiological value. Previous authors have
studied the incidence of infection in a cohort of IDUs [16]
although to the authors' knowledge no previous studies
have used this method of modelling to estimate the FOI
for HBV and HCV in the IDU population. The models
highlight the need to increase interventions that target
new initiates to injecting to reduce the transmission of
blood-borne viruses. Although from the evidence here,
identification of those individuals that engage in height￾ened at-risk behaviour should be undertaken. The data
and methods described here provide a baseline for moni￾toring the success of public health interventions.

Appendix
Force of infection
The FOI (λ(τ,t)), the rate at which susceptible IDUs
acquire infection [17], may vary with time (t) and inject￾ing career length (τ). The prevalence P(τ, t) quantifies the
expected proportion of individuals with injecting career
length τ who were antibody positive at time t [18].
Prevalence in year t for those who have injected for τ years
is:
P(τ, t) = 1 - e-Λ(τ, t)

Where τ0= max(0, τ - (t - T)) is the career length at time T.
The cumulative FOI for each reported injecting career
length is calculated by averaging over the range of possible
career lengths. As previously discussed the reported inject￾ing career length is calculated by considering the differ￾ence between an IDU's age at first injection and current
age when surveyed.
Therefore an IDU with a reported injecting career length =

day to A+1 years - 1 day the average cumulative
 where λ2is the FOI from A to A-1
years. Therefore the average cumulative FOI experienced
by IDUs reporting an injecting career length of A is
Appendix 2
Beginning with the following equations proposed by Far￾rington et al (2001) [7].
πBC(τ, t) = 1 - πB0(τ, t) - π0C(τ, t) - π00(τ, t)
The variables YB and YC should not be interpreted as the
cumulative FOI for HBV and HCV respectively because the
total prevalence of each infection depends on θ. We re￾parameterize these equations so that the total prevalence
of each infection is independent of θ as shown below.
We define
and
These are then substituted into Farrington's equations
above giving:
πBC(τ, t) = 1 - π00(τ, t) - πB0(τ, t) - π0C(τ, t)
where:
Total prevalence of HBV = πB0 + πBC= 
Total prevalence of HCV = πC0 + πBC= 
And therefore:
ΛB(τ, t) and ΛC(τ, t) are the cumulative force of infection
for HBV and HCV respectively in year t for injecting career
length τ.
