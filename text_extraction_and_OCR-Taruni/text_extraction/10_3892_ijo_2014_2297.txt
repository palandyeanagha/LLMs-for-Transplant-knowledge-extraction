Abstract. During the screening of natural chemicals that 
can reverse multidrug resistance in human A549 lung cancer 
cells resistant to etoposide (A549RT-eto), we discovered that 
Feroniellin A (FERO), a novel furanocoumarin, shows toxicity 
toward A549RT-eto cells in a dose- and time‑dependent 
manner. FERO reduced the expression of NF-κB, leading to 
downregulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by MDR1, 
which eventually sensitized A549RT-eto cells to apoptosis. 
FERO specifically diminished transcription and promoter 
activity of MDR1 but did not inhibit the expression of other 
multidrug resistance genes MRP2 and BCRP. Moreover, 
co-administration of FERO with Bay11-7802, an inhibitor of 
NF-κB, accelerated apoptosis of A549RT-eto cells through 
decreased expression of P-gp, indicating that NF-κB is 
involved in multidrug resistance. Conversely, addition of 
Z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, blocked FERO-induced 
apoptosis in A549RT-eto cells but did not block downregu￾lation of P-gp, indicating that a decrease in P-gp expression 
is necessary but not sufficient for FERO-induced apoptosis. 
Interestingly, we found that FERO also induces autophagy, 
which is characterized by the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II, 
induction of GFP-LC3 puncta, enhanced expression of 
Beclin-1 and ATG5, and inactivation of mTOR. Furthermore, 
suppression of Beclin-1 by siRNA reduced FERO-induced 
apoptosis in A549RT-eto cells and activation of autophagy by 
rapamycin accelerated FERO-induced apoptosis, suggesting 
that autophagy plays an active role in FERO-induced apoptosis. 
Herein, we report that FERO reverses multidrug resistance in 
A549RT-eto cells and exerts its cytotoxic effect by induction 
of both autophagy and apoptosis, which suggests that FERO 
can be a useful anticancer drug for multidrug-resistant lung 
cancer.
Introduction
Medicinal plants have proven to be a rich source of bioac￾tive compounds for therapeutic agents, and currently 75% of 
prescribed drugs worldwide are derived from plant sources (1). 
Feroniellin A (FERO), a novel furanocoumarin is isolated 
from the roots of Feroniella lucida. The chemical structure 
of furanocoumarins consists of a furan ring fused with 
coumarin, which is present in many plants. Coumarins possess 
anticoagulant, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-allergic and anticancer properties (2). Some furanocou￾marin derivatives isolated from plants show anticancer activity 
by functioning as topoisomerase I inhibitors (3), efflux trans￾port inhibitors or drug metabolism inhibitors (4,5). However, 
the specific molecular mechanisms by which FERO shows 
anticancer activity have not been revealed.
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major problem in cancer 
therapy and is often the result of overexpression of the drug 
efflux protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp is a 170-kDa 
protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily 
of membrane transporter proteins (6,7). P-gp is an energy￾dependent drug efflux pump that maintains intracellular drug 
concentrations below cytotoxic levels, thereby decreasing the 
cytotoxic effects of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents (6-9). 
P-gp also plays a role in inhibition of drug accumulation and 
caspase activation in MDR tumors (10,11). Of special note, 
Feroniellin A-induced autophagy causes apoptosis in 
multidrug-resistant human A549 lung cancer cells

recent lines of evidence have shown that NF-κB- or SIRT1-
mediated regulation of P-gp plays a critical role in anticancer 
drug resistance (12,13).
Autophagy, an ancient system necessary to maintain 
homeostasis in eukaryotic cells, degrades long-lived cyto￾plasmic proteins and organelles and provides nutrients during 
starvation or stress conditions (14) through programmed 
processing involving the sequential activity of autophagy￾related gene (ATG) products. As autophagy is necessary for 
cellular homeostasis, it is involved in biological processes 
including development, aging and degeneration (15). However, 
aberrant regulation of autophagy is related to many diseases, 
including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (16). As 
a specific example, the first report connecting autophagy to 
cancer showed that allelic loss of the essential autophagy gene 
Beclin-1 (BECN1) is prevalent in human breast, ovarian, and 
prostate cancers (17), and that Becn1+/- mice develop mammary 
gland hyperplasia and lymphomas as well as lung and liver 
tumors (18). Subsequent studies demonstrated that ATG5-/-
and ATG7-/-
 livers give rise to adenomas (19). These lines of 
evidence suggest that autophagy acts as a tumor suppressor in 
cancer development. Contrary to this, many other reports have 
shown that autophagy exerts a pro-survival function in tumor 
cells (20-22). Additional studies have demonstrated that the 
inhibition of autophagy by pharmaceutical drugs sensitized 
cells to apoptotic cell death, and that combination therapies 
using autophagy inhibitors plus chemotherapy led to faster 
tumor cell death than did chemotherapy alone (23). These 
findings indicate that pro-survival autophagy may represent a 
major hindrance to successful cancer therapy.
The present study was initiated to screen small molecules 
derived from plants grown in Thailand in order to reverse 
MDR in A549RT-eto cells. We have identified that FERO 
induces autophagy, which is necessary for FERO-induced 
apoptosis in A549RT-eto cells. Therefore, we propose that 
FERO represents a powerful candidate for the treatment of 
multidrug-resistant lung cancer.
Materials and methods
Cell cultures. A549RT-eto cells were developed and kindly 
provided by the Laboratory of Biochemistry, Chulabhorn 
Research Institute, Thailand and have been described else￾where (24). A549RT-eto cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 
medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 
10% FBS and 1% penicillin, and streptomycin (Gibco) at 37˚C 
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
Antibodies and reagents. For immunoblotting, antibodies 
against ATG5, LC3B (D11), mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser2448) 
and cleaved PARP (Asp214) were acquired from Cell Signaling 
Biotechnology (Beverly, MA, USA). Anti-P-gp (Calbiochem; 
San Diego, CA, USA) and β-actin (C4), BECN1 (H300), BID 
(FL-195), caspase-9 p35 (H-170), NF-κB p65 (F-6), P53 (DO-1), 
SIRT1 (H-300) and Sp1 (1C6) antibodies were purchased from 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Rapamycin, 
Z-VAD and BAY11-7082 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Feroniellin A was isolated from the roots 
of Feroniella lucida and was kindly provided by the Natural 
Products Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of 
Science, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand and have been 
described elsewhere (25).
Immunoblotting. Cells were harvested and lysed with lysis 
buffer [150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)]
containing 0.1 mM Na2VO3, 1 mM NaF and protease inhibi￾tors (Sigma). For immunoblotting, proteins from whole cell 
lysates were resolved by 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (PAGE) and then transferred to nitrocel￾lulose membranes. Primary antibodies were used at 1:1,000 
or 1:2,000 dilutions, and secondary antibodies conjugated 
with horseradish peroxidase were used at 1:2,000 dilutions in 
5% non-fat dry milk. After the final washing, nitrocellulose 
membranes were exposed using enhanced chemilumines￾cence assay and visualized on a LAS 4000 mini (Fuji, Tokyo, 
Japan).
Nuclear NF-κB pull-down assay. A549RT-eto cells (1x106
cells/ml) were incubated with FERO or DMSO as a control for 
12 h and nuclear extracts were prepared. Cells were pelleted 
and resuspended in 0.4 ml hypotonic lysis buffer [20 mM 
HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 
and 1 mM Na2VO3 plus protease inhibitors] and kept on ice 
for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14 000 g for 5 min at 
4˚C, the nuclear pellet was extracted with 0.1 ml hypertonic 
lysis buffer on ice for a further 20 min. After centrifugation 
at 14 ,000 g for 5 min at 4˚C, the supernatants were diluted 
to 100 mM NaCl and incubated with 25 µl of agarose beads 
conjugated to a consensus NF-κB binding oligonucleotide 
(Santa Cruz Biotech) for 1 h at 4˚C. After 3 washes, sample 
buffer was added and boiled for 5 min. The binding NF-κB 
(p65) protein to the oligonucleotide conjugated with agarose 
was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-p65 NF-κB Ab 
(Santa Cruz Biotech).
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. Cells were tryp￾sinized and incubated overnight to achieve 60-70% confluency 
before siRNA transfection. Beclin-1 human siRNA (pre‑made 
at Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea; 100 nM; sense: 5'-UGG AAU

Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cells were incubated with the trans￾fection mixture for 24 h and then rinsed with RPMI-1640 
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were 
incubated for 48 h before harvest.
Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy mini 
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions. Three micrograms of total RNA 
was converted to cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcrip￾tase (Invitrogen), and PCR was performed using the specific

and antisense: 5'-CAG TCC CAG TAC GAC TGT GAC A-3' 
were used. The cDNAs from each sample were diluted, and 
PCR was run at an optimized cycle number. β-actin mRNA 
was measured as an internal standard. After amplification, the 
products were subjected to electrophoresis on 2.0% agarose 
gels and detected by ethidium bromide staining.
Luciferase reporter assay. A549RT-eto cells were transfected 
with hMDR1-luciferase or control pGL3 empty luciferase 
vector. To normalize transfection efficiency, a pGK-β-gal 
vector that expresses galactosidase from a phosphoglucoki￾nase promoter was included in the transfection mixture. FERO 
was added to the transfected cells at 12 h before harvest. At 
48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and 
lysed in lysis solution [25 mM Tris (pH 7.8), 2 mM EDTA, 
2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100]. Luciferase 
activity was measured with a luminometer using a luciferase 
kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Cell viability assay. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-di￾phenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to 
measure cell survival as described previously (26). Dye solu￾tion containing tetrazolium was added to cells in a 96-well 
plate format and incubated for 2 h. The absorbance of the 
formazan produced by living cells was measured at 570 nm. 
The relative percentage of cell survival was calculated by 
the mean absorbance of the treated cells (ODT) and the mean 
absorbance of control cells (ODC) following the formula: 
% Cell survival = (ODT / ODC).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as a mean ± standard 
deviation (SD). Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis, 
with significance defined as a p-value <0.05.
Results
Feroniellin A induces apoptosis in human A549 lung cells 
resistant to etoposide. Previous observations have revealed 
that human etoposide resistant A549 lung cancer cells 
(A549RT-eto) exhibit upregulation of Stat1 and HDAC4, 
leading to elevated levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded 
by multidrug resistance (MDR) 1 (unpublished data). Thus, 
we performed a screen for small molecules derived from 
medicinal plants in Thailand that reverse MDR. We found that 
a small compound known as Feroniellin A (FERO; molecular 
weight = 388) (molecular structure shown in Fig. 1A) that 
efficiently induced death in A549RT-eto cells in a dose- and 
time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). We found that parental 
A549 cells showed more cytotoxicity toward FERO as well 
(data not shown). Since it has been reported that NF-κB and 
SIRT1 are involved in the regulation of MDR through P-gp 
protein levels (27), we sought to examine protein levels of

molecular weight of Feroniellin A (FERO). (B) A549RT-eto cells were treated with FERO (0, 0.05, 0.5 and 1 mM) for 12 h and were treated with FERO (1 mM)

treated with FERO (0, 0.05 and 0.5 mM) for 12 h. Cell lysates from A549RT-eto cells treated with FERO were prepared and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. 
The expression of pro-Bid and pro-caspase-9 proteins was detected by immunoblotting to confirm apoptosis. Protein levels of NF-κB, SIRT1, P53, and P-gp 
were examined by immunoblotting using the corresponding antibodies. RETRACTED

NF-κB, SIRT1 and P-gp in A549RT-eto cells treated with 0.05 
and 0.5 mM FERO 12 h post-treatment. Our findings show 
that FERO treatment reduces expression levels of NF-κB, 
SIRT1 and P-gp and enhances expression levels of P53, a 
representative tumor suppressor protein (Fig. 1C). In addition, 
we detected reduced pre-caspase-9 and pre-Bid levels in the 
same lysates of A549RT-eto cells, indicating induction of 
intrinsic apoptosis (Fig. 1C).
Feroniellin A reduces MDR1 transcript levels and promoter 
activity in A549RT-eto cells. In addition to the MDR1 gene, 
other genes such as multidrug resistance-associated protein 
(MRP) 2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are 
known to be involved in drug resistance (28,29). Therefore, 
we examined transcript levels of MDR1, MRP2 and BCRP in 
A549RT-eto cells during FERO treatment. RNA was isolated 
and cDNA generated from A549RT-eto cells treated with 0.05 
and 0.5 mM FERO for 12 h and genes were amplified using 
an optimized number of cycles. We found a significant reduc￾tion in MDR1 transcript levels with slight reductions in MRP2
levels following FERO treatment in a dose-dependent manner 
(Fig. 2A). However, transcript levels of BCRP were not reduced 
by FERO treatment (Fig. 2B). In addition to transcript levels, 
we also examined MDR1 promoter activity in A549RT-eto 
cells during FERO treatment using an MDR1-promoter lucif￾erase reporter vector (12). FERO treatment induced a dramatic 
decrease of MDR1-mediated luciferase activity in A549RT-eto 
cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that FERO reduces MDR1 promoter 
activity. Since it has been reported that the transcription factor 
NF-κB is involved in the regulation of P-gp (30,31), we next 
examined the nuclear localization of NF-κB and its DNA 
binding activity during FERO treatment. We found that FERO 
treatment inhibits translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm 
to the nucleus, which results in lowered levels of NF-κB at 
its binding site (Fig. 2C). On the basis of these results, we 
suggest that FERO inhibits MDR1 transcription, resulting in a 
decrease in P-gp protein levels, which leads to sensitization to 
apoptosis in A549RT-eto cells.
Inhibition of NF-κB accelerates FERO-induced apoptosis of 
A549RT-eto cells through downregulation of P-gp. Because 
we observed enhanced NF-κB protein levels and activity in 
A549RT-eto cells, we next explored whether NF-κB is involved 
in resistance to etoposide in A549 cells through upregula￾Figure 2. FERO suppresses MDR1 transcription and promoter activity and NF-κB transcriptional activity. (A) Total RNAs of A549RT-eto cells following 
FERO treatment (0, 0.05 and 0.5 mM) for 12 h were isolated and subjected to RT-PCR. Transcripts of MDR1, MRP2 and BCRP were examined after optimiza￾tion of PCR conditions. Relative mRNA ratios of each MDR-related gene are described relative to levels of β-actin following measurements of band intensities 
using Multi Gauge Version 2.1 (Fuji). (B) A549RT-eto cells were transfected with a MDR1-luciferase vector (1.6 µg) or pGL3 vector (1.6 µg) as a control and 
were harvested at 24 h post-transfection. When luciferase activity was measured, transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase reporter vector 
pGK-β-gal (1.6 µg). Results shown are the average of triplicate experiments. Bar indicates standard deviation. Black bars indicate MDR1-luciferase vector and

tion of P-gp. A549RT-eto cells were treated with 10 µM 
BAY11‑7082 (BAY), an inhibitor of NF-κB, and examined for 
cellular viability using the MTT assay. BAY treatment alone 
did not influence inhibition of cell growth in A549RT-eto 
cells, while 0.05 mM FERO treatment inhibited cell growth 
by ~30% at 24 h post-treatment compared to DMSO controls 
(Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we found that a combined treatment 
of FERO and BAY accelerated FERO-mediated apoptosis in 
A549RT-eto cells (Fig. 3A), which was confirmed by obser￾vations of cleaved PARP and pre-Bid (Fig. 3B). Moreover, 
when we examined protein levels of NF-κB, SIRT1 and P-gp 
after treatment with BAY alone, FERO alone, or BAY plus 
FERO, we found that BAY treatment alone decreased not only 
expression levels of NF-κB but also P-gp, but did not influence 
protein levels of SIRT1 in the cells (Fig. 3B). FERO treatment 
alone was shown to drastically diminish protein levels of 
NF-κB, SIRT1 and P-gp in A549RT-eto cells (Fig. 1C). We 
also observed that the combined treatment resulted in more 
significantly reduced protein levels of NF-κB, SIRT1 and P-gp 
(Fig. 3B). These results suggest that NF-κB is involved in 
MDR in A549 cells by upregulation of P-gp, resulting in resis￾tance to etoposide. To examine whether activation of caspase 
caused by FERO treatment is involved in apoptotic cell death 
in A549RT-eto cells, a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD, was 
used. FERO treatment alone at 0.5 mM resulted in a signifi￾cant induction of apoptotic cell death at 24 h post-treatment, 
while the combined treatment with FERO and Z-VAD blocked 
FERO-induced apoptotic cell death (Fig. 4A), which was 
confirmed by a lack of cleavage of PARP and pre-Bid proteins 
(Fig. 4B). These results indicate that activation of caspases is 
involved in FERO-induced apoptotic cell death in A549RT-eto 
cells. However, Z-VAD treatment did not block downregula￾tion of P-gp expression induced by FERO, indicating that a 
decrease of P-gp expression is necessary but not sufficient for 
apoptotic cell death.
FERO also induces autophagy in A549RT-eto cells. Auto￾phagy has a dual role in cancer, as a tumor suppressor and 
a pro-tumor cell survival mechanism (32,33). Therefore, we 
investigated whether FERO could induce autophagy, which is 
characterized by the formation of vacuoles, GFP-LC3 puncta, 
and LC3 I to LC3 II conversion. The presence of vacuoles 
was apparent in A549RT-eto cells treated with 0.5 mM FERO 
(Fig. 5A). There was also a clearly observable accumulation of 
GFP-LC3 II puncta in A549RT-eto cells treated with FERO, 
while no GFP-LC3 puncta were present in A549RT-eto cells 
treated with DMSO (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we observed LC3 I 
to LC3 II conversion in FERO-treated A549RT-eto cells in a 
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Lastly, we found induction 
of Beclin-1, required for the formation of autophagic vesicles 
(34), and reduction of phospho-mTOR levels, an inhibitor of 
autophagy, indicating that FERO treatment clearly induced 
autophagy in A549RT-eto cells (Fig. 5C).
Modulation of autophagy regulates FERO-induced apoptosis 
in A549RT-eto cells. Expression of Beclin-1 is known to be 
essential for double-membrane autophagosome formation 
required during the initial steps of autophagy (34). Therefore, 
we tested whether autophagy impairment via the suppression 
of Beclin-1 hinders or accelerates FERO-induced apoptosis.

We first determined the optimal siRNA concentration for 
suppression of Beclin-1 expression, which was found to be 
100 nM (data not shown). FERO treatment with control siRNA 
induced apoptosis by activation of caspase-3 or -7 due to 
cleavage of PARP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). 
Concomitantly, FERO induced autophagy coincided with 
an upregulation of Beclin-1 and ATG5, increased LC3 I 
to LC3 II conversion, and a reduction of phospho-mTOR 
levels in A549RT-eto cells. However, suppression of Beclin-1
with siRNA inhibited FERO-induced apoptosis, indicating 
that autophagy is necessary for FERO-induced apoptosis. 
Interestingly, we found that suppression of Beclin-1 by siRNA 
inhibited the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II but did not inhibit 
upregulation of ATG5 expression induced by FERO. These 
results indicate that conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II occurs later 
and ATG5 mediated processes take place earlier than Beclin-1 
mediated autophagy following FERO treatment (Fig. 6B). In 
addition, similar to the observation that Z-VAD suppresses 
FERO-induced apoptosis but does not block downregulation 
of P-gp, we also found that suppression of Beclin-1 does not 
block FERO-mediated decrease of P-gp expression despite the 
inhibition of FERO-induced apoptosis. This result indicates 
that downregulation of P-gp expression is necessary but not 
sufficient for the progression of apoptosis.
To verify that autophagy is necessary for FERO-induced 
apoptosis, we administered rapamycin (RAPA), an inhibitor of 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in order to accelerate 
A549RT-eto cell autophagy in the presence of FERO (35,36). 
FERO induced apoptosis in A549RT-eto cells as well as dual 
administration of FERO and RAPA was observed to enhance 
apoptosis (Fig. 7A). Co-treatment of FERO and RAPA induced 
autophagy by upregulating Beclin-1 and ATG5 expression, 
and converting LC3 I to LC3 II (Fig. 7B). These results suggest 
that FERO-induced autophagy promotes apoptotic cell death 
in A549RT-eto cells.
Discussion
Presently, identification of effective chemotherapeutic agents in 
phytochemicals of great interest to cancer biologists, because 
of MDR in cancer cells, which are developed following 
prolonged treatment with anticancer drug. Feroniellin A 
(FERO) was reported to possess in vitro cytotoxicity in human 
KB carcinoma and HeLa carcinoma cells (25). However, the 
molecular mechanism by which this compound exerts cyto￾toxicity in these cancer cell lines is unknown. For the first 
time, we have provided a line of evidence showing that FERO 
reverses MDR1 activity by downregulation of NF-κB, which 
leads to enhanced apoptotic susceptibility in A549RT-eto 
cells. Consistent with our results, other studies have shown 
that metformin, mollugin, and puerarin, which are derived 
from plants also reverse MDR1 activity effectively through 
downregulation of NF-κB in human breast cancer cells resis￾tant to adriamycin (30,37,38). Moreover, our study shows that 
inhibition of apoptosis with Z-VAD does not decrease P-gp 
expression, indicating that downregulation of P-gp is neces￾Figure 6. Inhibition of autophagy by Beclin-1 siRNA transfection reduces FERO-induced apoptosis in A549RT-eto cells. (A) A549RT-eto cells were treated 
with FERO (0, 0.5 and 1 mM) for 24 h following transfection with control or Beclin-1 siRNAs (100 nM). Cell viability was observed under a light microscope 
and measured using the MTT assay. Data were calculated as percent of relative cell viability and expressed as the mean of three experiments (*
p<0.05 control 
siRNA vs. Beclin-1 siRNA at FERO 0.5 mM; **p<0.05; control siRNA vs. Beclin-1 siRNA at FERO 1 mM). (B) Cell lysates from the treated A549RT-eto cells 
were prepared and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Cleavage of PARP protein was detected for apoptosis by immunoblotting. Protein levels of Beclin-1, ATG5, 
mTOR, P-mTOR and P-gp, and cleavage of LC3 I were examined by immunoblotting using the corresponding antibodies. RETRACTED

sary but not sufficient for apoptosis. As SIRT1, β-catenin and 
HIF-1α have also been associated with MDR in many cancer 
models (39-41), we are currently investigating whether FERO 
affects the expression levels and activity of these proteins, 
rendering A549RT-eto cells susceptible to apoptosis.
Detailed reviews of autophagic progress can be found 
as described elsewhere (33,42). Briefly, autophagy is initi￾ated by activation of the ATG1 complex, which includes 
ATG1/ATG13/ATG17, among other components. Next, 
autophagosome nucleation occurs, which requires class III 
phsophatidylinositol-3-kinase plus Beclin-1/ATG6 in addi￾tion to several other factors to recruit proteins and lipids 
involved in autophagosome formation. Vesicle elongation 
and completion are mediated by two-ubiquitin-like systems: 
ATG7 (E1-like) and ATG3 (E2-like), which are necessary 
for the lipid modification of LC3 (phosphatidylethanolamine; 
PE), which requires initial cleavage of LC3. Subsequently, 
the ATG12/ATG5/ATG16 complex mediates LC3-PE binding 
to the autophagosome membrane. Finally, the completed 
autophagosome fuses with lysosomes, where the autophago￾some contents are degraded. We observed that suppression of 
Beclin-1 in the presence of FERO results in the inhibition of 
LC3 I to LC3 II conversion but does not inhibit ATG5 expres￾sion. Considering the sequential progress of autophagy, we 
assume that LC3 I to LC3 II conversion is very closely linked 
to Beclin-1 activity but that suppression of Beclin-1 itself does 
not affect FERO-induced ATG5 expression. Although we 
have observed that autophagy impairment such as Beclin-1
suppression with siRNA generated reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) (data not shown) as reported elsewhere (43,44), we also 
found that autophagy impairment with Beclin-1 suppression 
in fact protects cells from FERO-induced apoptosis. Based on 
this finding, we speculate that the amount of ROS generated 
by autophagy impairment does not influence aggravation of 
A49RT-eto cell survival. In addition, apoptosis inhibition with 
Z-VAD did not block FERO-induced autophagic progress such 
as upregulation of Beclin1 and ATG5, and converting LC3 I 
to LC3 II (Fig.4B), indicating that autophagic progress is the 
upstream event of apoptosis.
Recently, autophagy inhibitors such as chloroquine (CQ) 
or hydroxychloroquine have been used in clinical trials 
because autophagy is believed to affect tumor survival (45-47). 
Therefore, it is possible that conventional chemotherapy with 
autophagy inhibitors may increase tumor cytotoxicity. In a 
mouse prostate cancer model, co-treatment with an Src family 
kinase inhibitor and CQ increased tumor cell numbers in vitro
but reduced tumor cell growth in vivo (48). Conversely, since it 
has been suggested that autophagy also plays a role as a tumor 
suppressor, introduction of autophagy stimulants such as mTOR 
inhibitors with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs leads to 
accelerated tumor cell death compared to treatment with anti￾cancer drugs alone (49,50). Since there are conflicting reports as 
to the positive and negative effects of autophagy on tumor cell 
death (32,33), the field needs to be cautious when attempting 
to manipulate autophagy to improve clinical outcomes. In 
conclusion, our study has demonstrated that FERO-induced 
autophagy is required for apoptotic progression and suggests 
that autophagy plays a role as a tumor suppressor in our model.

(0.25 mM) alone, rapamycin (RAPA; 10 nM) alone and FERO plus RAPA for 24 h. Cellular morphology was observed under light a microscope and cell 
growth was measured by MTT assay. Data were calculated as percent of relative cell viability and expressed as the mean of three experiments (*

vs. FERO; **p<0.05; FERO vs. FERO+RAPA). (B) Cell lysates from the treated A549RT-eto cells were prepared and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Expression 
levels of Beclin-1, ATG5, phospho-mTOR, mTOR and P-gp were examined by immunoblotting using the corresponding antibodies. Cleavage of PARP and 
LC3 I was detected by immunoblotting using the corresponding antibodies. RETRACTED
