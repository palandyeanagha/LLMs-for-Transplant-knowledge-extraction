Abstract
This study is the largest Italian survey on liver retransplantations (RET). Data report on 167 adult patients who received 2
grafts, 16 who received 3 grafts, and one who received 4 grafts over a 11 yr period. There was no statistically significant
difference in graft survival after the first or the second RET (52, 40, and 29% vs 44, 36, and 18% at 1,5,and 10 yr, respectively:
Log-Rank test, p = 0.30). Survivals at 1, 5, and 10 years of patients who underwent 2 (n = 151) or 3 (n = 15) RETs, were 65,
48,and 39% vs 59, 44, and 30%, respectively (p = 0.59). Multivariate analysis of survival showed that only the type of graft
(whole vs reduced) was associated with a statistically significant difference (HR = 3.77, Wald test p = 0. 05); the donor age
appeared to be a relevant factor as well, although the difference was not statistically significant (HR = 1.91, Wald test
p = 0.08). Though late RETs have better results on long term survival relative to early RETs, no statistically significant
difference can be found in early results, till three years after RET. Considering late first RETs (interval.30 days from previous
transplantation) with whole grafts the difference in graft survival in RETs due to HCV recurrence (n = 17) was not significantly
different from RETs due to other causes (n = 53) (65–58 and 31% vs 66–57 and 28% respectively at 1–5 and 10 years,
p = 0.66).

Introduction
Liver transplantation (LT) can be described as the most
revolutionary and challenging surgical technique of the twentieth
century. At present, approximately 6000 LT are performed each
year both in Europe [1] and in the U.S [2]. LT is now a procedure
applied all around the world [3,4]. However, this surgical option
has become a victim of its own success as liver transplantation
cannot be performed in all patients who need it. Because of the
persistently small number of cadaveric organ donors, and the
consequent impossibility to satisfy all needs, the number of patients
on the waiting lists continues to rise. Many patients die while
waiting for the transplant.
The discrepancy between organ availability and organ necessity
is also exacerbated by the circumstance that certain patients need
a second liver transplant. Therefore, in a situation of relative organ
shortage, our aim was to identify the risk factors related to survival
after retransplantation (RET) in a 11–year multicenter Italian
study.
Aims of the study were to:
1) calculate graft and patient survival rates after RET
2) compare graft survival rates after the first and the second
RET
3) identify the risk factors for the loss of grafts after the first
RET.
Patients and Methods
The study was notified to the Ethics Committee of the
Institutions where the data were collected, specifically to the
Comitato Etico della Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda – Ospedale
Maggiore Policlinico. According to the Italian laws (Gazzetta
Ufficiale, serie generale, n.76, p. 67–74). No specific request and
patient approval are needed for retrospective studies.
Informed consent was obtained as usual for medical, surgical,
radiological treatments, not specifically for this retrospective study.
Patients gave written consent for every procedure performed in the
hospitals including treatment of data for medical purposes.

We collected data on liver RETs performed over 11 a yr period
(from 1998 to 2008 included) in transplant centers referring to the
Nord Italia Transplant (NIT), the north-Italian organ allocation
agency. Eight Transplant Centres were included in the study:
Ancona, Genova, Milano Niguarda, Milano Policlinico, Milano
Istituto dei Tumori, Padova, Udine S. Maria, and Udine
Policlinico. The data collection ended in may 2009. 184 liver
RETs in adult patients were studied, including 167 second
transplants, 16 third transplants, and 1 fourth liver transplant.
The mean follow-up time of the graft after RET was 2.362.9
years (median 0.7, range of 0–10.8). The mean follow-up time of
patients since the first liver transplant was 4.164.5 years (median
2.8, range of 0–22.5).
Continuous and categorical data, referring to the recipient, the
donor and the transplant, were collected.
The donor variables included age (years), gender, plasma AST
(Aspartate aminotransferase) (UI/L), ALT (Alanine aminotrans￾ferase) (UI/L), GGT (gamma -Glutamyltransferase) (UI/L), and
sodium (mEq/L); the recipient variables were age (years), gender,
serum creatinine (mg/dL), bilirubin (mg/dL), INR (International
Normalized Ratio), AST (UI/L), ALT (UI/L), Albumine (g/dL),
platelets (n6106
/L), MELD (Mayo End-Stage Liver Disease)score,
MELD in categories (,15/15–24/25.), UNOS (United Network
for Organ Sharing) Status (1, 2a, 2b,3).
The transplant variables included the interval of ischaemia
(minutes), the type of transplanted graft (whole graft/partial),
extracorporeal circulation (yes/no), the indications for LT, the
causes of RET (HAT – Hepatic artery Thrombosis-/PNF –
Primary Non Function-/REJ (Rejection)/REC (Recurrence)/
Other), the interval (days) from the previous LT (0–8/8–30/30–
180/180–365/. 365), the pre-existing graft (whole graft/partial).
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival of
patients and grafts after RET in relation to the number of
transplantations. The Log-Rank test was performed to evaluate
the difference between the graft survival after the 1st RET and the
graft survival after the 2nd RET; it was also used to compare early
and late RETs and the survival after the 1st late RET (performed
at least 30 days after LT) with a whole graft, carried out for
recurrent HCV (Hepatitis C Virus)cirrhosis vs other indications.
Then we performed an univariate analysis of various param￾eters in relation to graft survival after first RET, using the Kaplan￾Meier estimator and the Log-Rank test for categorical variables
and PH Cox model and Wald test for continuous variables. We
considered variables of interest those with p-value,0.1.
Finally, the data statistically significant at the univariate
analysis, were evaluated in a multivariate analysis with a PH
Cox regression model. In this analysis p#0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Patients and RETs characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Overall survivals of patients who underwent RET were 65, 48,
and 38% at 1, 5, and 10 years respectively. The 1, 5 and 10 yr
survivals of patients who underwent 2 (n = 151) and 3 (n = 15)
transplantations were 65, 48 and 39% and 59, 44 and 30%
respectively (p = 0.59). The 75% of deaths occurred within 6
months from RET.
The overall graft survival respectively at 1, 5 and 10 years after
RET (n = 184) was 51, 40 and 29%, respectively. Graft survival
after the first RET (n = 167) at 1, 5, and 10 years was not
significantly different (p = 0.30) from survival after the second
RET (n = 16): 52, 40, and 29% vs 44, 36, and 18% respectively.
The univariate analysis of factors correlated with 1, 5 and 10 yr
survivals is shown in Table 2 for categorical values and Table 3 for
continuous values. Several factors reached statistical significance
including donor age, serum GOT/AST, time interval , or .30
days, type of graft, ischemia time, recipient age, UNOS state,
MELD Score, serum creatinine, platelets count.
Result of a multivariate analysis on 10 variables selected after
univariate analysis, including 94 observations are shown in
Table 4. Only the donor’s age (.61years) and the type of graft
(partial grafts) showed a statistical significance.
The analysis of 1-year graft survival, divided on the basis of
interval after the previous transplant - (0–8, 9–30, 31–180, 181–
365 days and over 1 year), showed a trend to worse outcomes for
early RETs relative to late RETs (Fig. 1) but the difference was not
statistically significant (p = .28).
The 1, 3 and 5 years graft survival in 82 primary early RET
(,30 days from previous LT) relative to 85 late ones (.30 days)
was 45.1,35.3 and 29.4% vs 58.8, 52.3 and 50.4%, respectively,
with a statistically significant difference (p = .02);
The 60-day graft survival according to the Kaplan Meier
method in the two groups based on time interval from previous
LT, was 56,1% and 67.1 for grafts with short and prolonged
interval respectively, with no statistically significant difference
(p = .14).
One year graft survival was 45.1 vs 58.8%, respectively,
(p = .08); At two years survival was 41.1 vs 53.7 (p = .10), at three
35.3 vs 52.3(p = .04), at five 29.4 vs 50.4(p = .02), at seven 21.5 vs
45 (p = .01).
Therefore, with regard to post-RET survival, the time interval
from previous LT has no statistical relevance during the
perioperative time, or within the 1st year after LT but the
difference appears to gain significance 3 years after primary RET.
The univariate analysis of usual continuous and categorical
variables related to 3 years graft survival identified as important
factors banded (0–15, 16–25, over 25) MELD score (p = 0.009),
UNOS status (p = 0.01), donor AST (p = .01), recipient serum
creatinine (p = .02), time interval from previous LT (p = .02) but
not donor age (banded as age,40, 41–70, over 70 years).
The multivariate analysis performed with factors that had a
statistical significance on univariate analysis showed only MELD
score ,15 as an important variable for 3 years survival (p = .03).
Finally, 1–5–10 years graft survival of late RETs (interval.30
days) for HCV recurrence with a whole graft (n = 17) compared to
RETs performed for other causes (n = 53) did not show any
statistically significant difference (65–58–31% vs 66–57–28%
respectively: p = 0.66).
Discussion
In recent years, LT outcome is progressively improving. As for
the December 2010 ELTR (European Liver Transplant Registry)
data (downloaded on July 2012), the 1-year survival post LT for
adult patients in Europe was 84% from 2000 to 2004 and 85%
from 2004 to 2010, while in the U.S was 87% [2].
Despite the progressive improvement in survival, a proportion
of liver transplants fail. Consequently, in these cases RET is the
‘‘only alternative to death’’ [5].
In the U.S. the number of RET is approximately 500 per year
that is about 8% of transplants [6]. This rate is decreasing.
The causes of RET are highlighted in the 1988–2010 data of
the ELTR concerning 6,233 RETs [1]. Whereas within the first
weeks after LT, PNF and technical factors have the greater
impact, at later intervals, graft rejection and non-cancer recur￾rences (e.g. hepatitis) are predominant. According to the study of
Liver Retransplantations in Italy
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46643

Kashyap [7] published in 2001, concerning transplanted patients
from 1986 to 1998 at the University of Pittsburgh, the causes of
graft failure that required a second transplant were PNF (32.2%),
followed by HAT (27.6%), chronic rejection (14.5%), and primary
disease recurrences (5.5%).
A study [5] carried out on 157 RETs performed from 1989 to
2003 showed a sharp decrease in RET due to rejection. In the
same study, the rate of RET due to early graft failure (INF - Initial
non-function) and HAT were, conversely, increasing.
According to a recent multicenter study by Stange [8] the
overall incidence of HAT is less than 5% but the overall mortality
rate after a diagnosis of thrombosis is 55% with an 80% rate of
RET. This probably depends on two factors: 1) the use of older
donors with arteries in a worse condition and 2) on the increased
use of reduced livers such as ‘‘split right’’ grafts with hazardous
vessels. The increasing rate of RET due to early graft failure (PNF
- primary non-function or INF - Initial Not Function -) can also be
explained by the larger use of the so-called ‘‘marginal donors’’
[9,10]. In our study, PNF was the primary indication for RET
(32.2%) followed by HAT (27.6%); HCV recurrence was
responsible for 12.5% of our RETs.
The overall survival of our patients who underwent RET was
64.6% at 1 year and 47.8% at 5 years. They were mainly patients
who underwent two transplants (n = 151) whereas only a small
number underwent three transplants (n = 15). In our series, the
survival of patients undergoing two transplants was 65, 48 and
39% at 1, 5 and 10 years while for ELTR was 71, 60 and 47%.

Liver Retransplantations in Italy
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46643

The Italian data, obtained over the last 10 years, appears worse
than those from ELTR data considering RETs from 1988 to 2010.
Consistent with the European data [1], mortality after RET in
our series confirms that the most critical period lies within the first
6 months: indeed, 75% of deaths occurred within 6 months from
RET.
As reported by ELTR [1], graft survivals after the first RET at
1, 5 and 10 years were 58, 46 and 37%, respectively, whereas our
corresponding rates are 52, 40 and 29%. Even in this case, graft
survival rates after the first RET in Italy appear lower than those
reported in the European study. The cause of this discrepancy
might probably emerge only through comparison of data that
unfortunately are not available: MELD score, UNOS status, type
of grafts, donor and recipient ages. These are all factors that
should be considered but that it is not possible to extrapolate from
ELTR data.
The European data show a statistically significant difference in
graft survival after the first relative to the second RET, with a
worse survival after the second transplant. In our series, we
observed a similar trend but the difference did not reach statistical
significance probably because of the limited number of patients
who underwent the second RET.
RET is often a surgically demanding, very expensive procedure
[11]. In order to assess the risk associated with a RET, in our

Liver Retransplantations in Italy
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46643

univariate and multivariate analyses we studied several parameters
including interval after the previous transplant, the UNOS status,
the MELD Score and the indication to RET.
The importance of the interval from the previous transplant has
been addressed by several authors [12,13,14,15] pointing out that
early RETs (range ,30 days) have worse outcomes than later
ones. Onaca [16], in a small study (44 cases) investigating RETs,
carried out at about 2 years after the first transplant, showed a
better 2-year survival for ‘‘early’’ (81%) than for late (50%) RETs.
In our series this result is ambiguous: indeed, despite there are
better long term survivals (Log-Rank test, p = . 02) for late relative
to early RETs, this difference becomes evident only after three
years from RET. Consequently, we believe that early and late
RET are both justified by survival results.
Moreover, because of reported conflicting data concerning
RET for HCV recurrence or for other causes, we explored this
issue only considering late whole grafts and no difference in
survival was found.
The UNOS Status (a classification in four classes of patients
according to their clinical conditions before surgery) and the state
of emergency related to RET, have been correlated to RET
outcome by several authors [11,14]: the worse results were
associated with greater emergency. This observation was con￾firmed by our study, where the UNOS status was statistically
significant at univariate analysis of data on the first RETs (Log￾Rank test, p = .003).
Recent observations suggests that the MELD score represents a
good prognostic predictor of survival after RET. Ravaioli et al.
[17] in 2004 separated their series of RET (n = 87) according to
the MELD score at the time of RET. Patients were devided into
two groups based on a MELD score .25 and ,24. Graft and
patient survivals were significantly lower in the first relative to the
second group, validating the MELD score as an indicator of
survival after RET. Yao e Onaca [16] obtained similar results. In
our study, separation of patients in three groups on the basis of

MELD scores (,16, 16–24, .25) showed a statistically significant
difference in global survivals (Log-Rank test, p = . 02) of patients
with different MELD scores. Patients in the higher score groups
had the worse survival.
Some authors have also found a correlation between RET
indications and subsequent survival. Recent studies [5] point out
that PNF and HAT are associated with worse survival. Recurrence
of primary disease has intermediate effects. RET for chronic
rejection and ischemic biliary lesions have the best survival. In our
study, we found no statistically significant association between
RET graft survival and indications to RET.
In the attempt to develop prognostic scores, other factors related
to prognosis of RET have been studied by several authors. The
best known studies are those from Facciuto (48 cases) [19], Meneu
(122 cases) [20], Azoulay (139 cases) [17], Rosen (281 cases) [21],
Bilbao (74 cases) [22], Yao (40 cases) [18], Linhares (139 cases)
[14], and from our group (35 cases) [23]: the most frequently
considered factors in the univariate analysis are age, high values of
serum creatinine and bilirubin in the recipient, the urgency, the
cold ischemia time.
All these variables, in addition to those reported above (UNOS
status, MELD score, interval from the previous transplant), were
likewise significant in our study: donor age over 60 years, a total
ischaemia time longer than 12 hours, recipient age over 56 years,
recipient creatinine greater than 2.6 mg/dL, a platelet count less
than 50,000, the type of graft used with increased risk for partial
grafts, reached statistical significance at univariate analysis.
Although most of the data refer to the recipient, the multivariate
analysis emphasizes the importance of two donor factors: 1) type of
RET graft (p = .05) - partial grafts in our series did not reach one
year of survival and 2) the donor age (p = .08). Although donor age
was not statistically significant at multivariate analysis, it clearly
deserves consideration.
Our data, therefore, show that survival after the first liver RET
mainly depends on the clinical conditions of the recipient but
donor factors may likewise have great influence.
In our study we focused our attention on graft survival rather
than on patient survival. We believe that, in an era of shortage of
organs, though the importance of a single human life, it is an
ethical duty to self-limit the use of multiple grafts for a single
patient. Despite the good patient survival results reported by some
authors [24] after repeated RET, graft survival data must be
always considered and a rare resource should not be wasted.
Conclusions
This is the largest Italian study concerning liver RET.
In our series, graft survival at 1 year after RET is 51%. RET
may be considered a waste of a precious resource that could be
used for first transplants. However, in our series, the 1-year
survival of patients undergoing two transplants is 65%; based on
this observation a RET appears to be an acceptable option.
A different approach to early and late RETs does not seem to be
justified. Infact though late RETs have better results on long term
survival, no statistical difference is found in early results, till three
years after RET. So denial of a RET to a patient in the first 30
days post LT is not ethical. As legitimacy of late RETs is
established, candidates for RET cannot be selected on the basis of
ethiology: graft survivals after late RETs showed no statistically
significant difference between patients with HCV recurrence and
patients with other indications.
Univariate analysis of factors associated with survival after RET
highlights the importance of known factors: they concern both the

recipient (UNOS status, MELD score, serum creatinine, platelet
number, age), and the donor/transplant (donor age, SGOT, type
of graft, ischemia time). At multivariate analysis the recipient’s
variables lose their significance while the type of graft (whole or
reduced) remains significant and the donor age (above or below 60
years) lies close to statistical significance.
According to our study the decision to perform a RET, should
be primarily based on the clinical characteristics of the recipient,
but the type of graft and the donor age should be considered as
factors of substantial importance.
