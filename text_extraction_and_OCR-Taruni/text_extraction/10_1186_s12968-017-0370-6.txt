Abstract
Background: A comprehensive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in reperfused ST-segment myocardial
infarction (STEMI) patients can be challenging to perform and can be time-consuming. We aimed to investigate
whether native T1-mapping can accurately delineate the edema-based area-at-risk (AAR) and post-contrast T1-mapping
and synthetic late gadolinium (LGE) images can quantify MI size at 1.5 T. Conventional LGE imaging and T2-mapping
could then be omitted, thereby shortening the scan duration.
Methods: Twenty-eight STEMI patients underwent a CMR scan at 1.5 T, 3 ± 1 days following primary percutaneous
coronary intervention. The AAR was quantified using both native T1 and T2-mapping. MI size was quantified using
conventional LGE, post-contrast T1-mapping and synthetic magnitude-reconstructed inversion recovery (MagIR) LGE
and synthetic phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) LGE, derived from the post-contrast T1 maps.
Results: Native T1-mapping performed as well as T2-mapping in delineating the AAR (41.6 ± 11.9% of the left ventricle
[% LV] versus 41.7 ± 12.2% LV, P = 0.72; R2 0.97; ICC 0.986 (0.969–0.993); bias −0.1 ± 4.2% LV). There were excellent
correlation and inter-method agreement with no bias, between MI size by conventional LGE, synthetic MagIR LGE (bias 0.
2 ± 2.2%LV, P = 0.35), synthetic PSIR LGE (bias 0.4 ± 2.2% LV, P = 0.060) and post-contrast T1-mapping (bias 0.3 ± 1.8% LV,
P = 0.10). The mean scan duration was 58 ± 4 min. Not performing T2 mapping (6 ± 1 min) and conventional LGE
(10 ± 1 min) would shorten the CMR study by 15–20 min.
Conclusions: T1-mapping can accurately quantify both the edema-based AAR (using native T1 maps) and acute MI size
(using post-contrast T1 maps) in STEMI patients without major cardiovascular risk factors. This approach would shorten the
duration of a comprehensive CMR study without significantly compromising on data acquisition and would obviate the
need to perform T2 maps and LGE imaging.

Background
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is considered
the gold standard imaging modality for quantifying
myocardial infarct (MI) size [1]. It can also provide in￾formation on the edema-based area-at-risk (AAR) [2, 3],
which can be used to calculate myocardial salvage (by
subtracting MI size from the AAR) - a more sensitive
measure for assessing the efficacy of novel cardioprotec￾tion therapies for reducing MI size in reperfused
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
patients [4].
T2-weighted imaging in the first week following
primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI)
has been used to delineate the AAR in STEMI
patients [5], but has recently attracted controversy [6, 7].
T2-mapping [8] has emerged as a more robust technique
but has not yet been established as the gold standard for
the AAR (therefore referred to as the edema-based AAR
throughout the article) and is a topic of ongoing research.
Native T1-mapping has been shown to perform well
against T2-mapping in a canine model of MI [3], and in
clinical patients at 3.0 T [2]. So far, no study has directly
compared the performance of T1-mapping against
T2-mapping at 1.5 T in these patients.
Conventionally, MI can be identified by late gado￾linium enhancement (LGE) with inversion recovery
(IR) T1-weighted sequences and manual adjustment
of the inversion times (TI) to null the remote normal
myocardium. Post-contrast T1-mapping has also
shown promise to detect acute MI in a small cohort
of predominantly non-reperfused acute MI patients
and chronic MI [9, 10]. Refinements of the T1
Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MOLLI)
prototype using IR images at different TIs initially
designed to improve motion correction [11], can also
create “synthetic” IR LGE images, namely magnitude￾reconstructed IR (MagIR), phase-sensitive IR (PSIR)
outputs. These synthetic read-outs have recently been
shown to accurately detect chronic MI size in a small
cohort of 17 patients [12]. To date, no studies have
assessed the performance of post-contrast T1 map￾ping and synthetic LGE in quantifying MI size with
full left ventricular (LV) coverage in a cohort of re￾perfused STEMI patients.
A comprehensive CMR study in STEMI can be
time-consuming. Therefore, the aims of this study
were to investigate, firstly, whether native T1-mapping
can accurately delineate the edema-based AAR at
1.5 T (using T2-mapping as the reference); and
secondly, whether post-contrast T1-mapping and
synthetic IR LGE images can quantify MI size (using
conventional LGE as the reference). This may allow
one to omit conventional LGE imaging and T2-
mapping to quantify MI size and the edema-based
AAR, respectively, thereby shortening the duration of
the scan.
Methods
Study population
Twenty-eight acute STEMI patients reperfused by PPCI
were chosen from a cohort reported in previous studies
[13–17] based on the availability of full LV coverage of
post-contrast T1 mapping and the availability of the
synthetic IR output dataset (recruitment period for the
whole cohort was August 2013 to July 2014, the option
to generate synthetic LGE images from the T1 maps
were available from January 2014). The management of
STEMI was as per current guidelines. Study exclusion
criteria were known previous MI and standard
recognized contraindications to CMR. The UK National
Research Ethics Service approved this study and all
patients provided informed consent. All 28 patients
underwent CMR at 3 ± 1 days post-PPCI.
Imaging acquisition
All CMR scans were performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner
(Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany) using a 32-channel phased-array cardiac coil.
The protocol included cine CMR images, T2 maps, na￾tive T1 maps, T2* maps, early gadolinium enhancement
(EGE), conventional LGE and post-contrast T1 maps
(All short axis T1/T2 maps, EGE and LGE images were
aligned with the short axis cine MR images). Full LV
short axis coverage was acquired for all sequences ex￾cept for T2* maps (basal, mid and apical short axis). The
T2* maps and EGE were not analyzed for this specific
study but the time taken for each imaging sequence was
recorded to the nearest minute to obtain representative
duration of a comprehensive CMR study in these
patients.
T2-mapping (work in progress #448B, Siemens healthcare)
T2 maps were acquired using 3 single-shot images at
different T2 preparation times (0 ms, 24 ms, and 55 ms)
as previously described [8]. The imaging parameters
were: pixel bandwidth 930 Hz/pixel; echo time = 1.1 ms;
repetition time = 3xR-R interval; flip angle = 70°; acqui￾sition matrix = 116 × 192; slice thickness = 6 mm; slice
gap = 4 mm; voxel size = 2.0 × 2.0 × 6.0 mm; temporal
resolution = 190 ms; acceleration factor = 2). Fitting was
performed inline to estimate T2 relaxation times and a
colored T2 map consisting of pixel-wise T2 values was
generated inline following motion correction.
Native T1-mapping (work in progress #448B, Siemens
healthcare)
T1 maps were acquired using a steady state free
precession-based MOLLI prototype. A 5 s(3 s)3 s
Bulluck et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2017) 19:57 Page 2 of 11

modified MOLLI sampling protocol was used as previ￾ously described [11]. The acquisition parameters were:
pixel bandwidth 977 Hz/pixel; echo time = 1.1 ms; flip
angle = 35°; matrix = 256 × 144; slice thickness = 6 mm;
slice gap = 4 mm; voxel size = 1.5 × 1.5 × 6.0 mm;
temporal resolution = 227 ms; acceleration factor = 2).
Motion correction and a non-linear least-square curve
fitting were performed with the set of images acquired at
different inversion times to generate a pixel-wise colored
T1 map inline.
Late gadolinium enhancement
Conventional Mag-IR LGE imaging was acquired using pre￾dominantly a respiratory motion-corrected, free-breathing
single shot steady state free precession averaged inversion
recovery (MOCO-FB) LGE sequence in 22/28 patients
(typical imaging parameters were: bandwidth = 977 Hz/
pixel; echo time = 1.48 ms; repetition time = 700-900 ms;
flip angle = 50°; acquisition matrix = 144 × 256; slice
thickness = 8 mm; slice gap: 2 mm; voxel
size = 1.6 × 1.6 × 8.0 mm; temporal resolution = 202 ms;
acceleration factor 2) or a standard segmented ‘fast low￾angle shot’ (FLASH) two-dimensional IR gradient echo se￾quence in 6/28 patients (imaging parameters were: band￾width = 140 Hz/pixel; echo time = 3.17 ms; repetition
time = 700-900 ms; flip angle = 21°; acquisition
matrix = 125 × 256; slice thickness = 8 mm; slice gap:
2 mm; voxel size = 2.1 × 2.1 × 8.0 mm; temporal
resolution = 140 ms; acceleration factor: 2) at 10 min after
the injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gadoterate meglumine
(Gd-DOTA marketed as Dotarem, Guerbet S.A., Paris,
France). For both LGE sequences, the inversion times were
progressively optimized to null the normal remote myocar￾dium (typical values 360 to 440 ms).
Post-contrast T1-mapping (work in progress #448B, Siemens
healthcare)
Post-contrast MOLLI T1 maps were obtained in-line
using the 4 s(1 s)3 s(1 s)2 s sampling protocol (to im￾prove the accuracy of T1 s in the 200-600 ms range as
previously described [11]) 15 min after contrast injection
(0.1 mmol/kg of Dotarem) using similar acquisition
parameters as for native T1 maps.
Both the native and post-contrast MOLLI T1-
mapping automatically generated 2 sets of IR images
(MagIR and PSIR) in-line by the scanner for the TI
range between 200 to 975 ms (25 ms increments) as
illustrated in Fig. 1.
Imaging analysis
All imaging analysis was performed using CVI42 software
(Version 5.1.2, Calgary, Canada).
Quantification of MI size
The endocardial and epicardial borders were manually
delineated on all the conventional LGE short-axis LV
images and were copied to all corresponding images for
analysis with minimal manual adjustments. All sequences
were subsequently analyzed independent of each other. A
reference region of interest (ROI) was drawn in the remote
normal myocardium using the automated option available
on CVI42 (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, Calgary, Canada)
to minimize variability (with minimal manual adjustment
when needed) and this was done for each imaging tech￾nique independently. MI size was quantified using a signal
intensity threshold of 5 standard deviations (SD) above the
normal remote myocardium [12, 18] and expressed as the
percentage of the whole LV (%LV). Transmural extent of
infarct (TEI) was also quantified and expressed in groups
of “no LGE”, “1–25%TEI”, “26–50%TEI”, “51–75% TEI”
and “76–100%TEI” as per the 16-segment American Heart
Association model.
For the synthetic MagIR LGE, the image with the opti￾mal TI (remote normal myocardium nulled as black)
was manually selected and the corresponding matching
PSIR image was selected as the representative synthetic
PSIR LGE image (Fig. 1). A threshold of 5SD was also
used to quantify synthetic MI size.
For the post-contrast T1 maps, we used 2 semi￾automated techniques, namely a threshold of 2-SD
below the mean remote myocardial post-contrast T1
and the Otsu technique (which identifies the intensity
threshold from the signal intensity histogram using the
value with minimal intra-class variance between low and
high intensities) [19]. These 2 techniques were applied
on a slice-by-slice basis. MI size was expressed as: by
conventional LGE (reference standard) as MIConv; MagIR
synthetic LGE as MISynthMagIR; PSIR synthetic LGE as
MISynthPSIR; post-contrast T1 MI size by 2-SD as
MIT1Post2SD; and by Otsu as MIT1PostOtsu.
Quantification of the edema-based AAR
The endocardial and epicardial borders were manually
traced on the T2 maps and copied to the T1 maps with
minimal manual adjustments. In the absence of estab￾lished quantification techniques, we used manual
contouring as reference (%LV) and compared against a
threshold of 2-SD above the remote myocardium and
the Otsu technique (expressed as AART2Man, AART22SD,
AART2Otsu and AART1Man, AART12SD, AART1Otsu re￾spectively). The Otsu technique was not applied on
maps that were visually normal based on the colored
look-up table and with normal wall motion on cine MR
images were manually selected as normal.
Areas of hypo-intense core of microvascular obstruc￾tion (MVO) were included as part of the MI zone and
edema-based AAR. Manual ROIs were drawn in MI

zone and the remote myocardium to obtain representa￾tive native and post-contrast T1 and T2 values.
Statistical analysis
SPSS version 22 (International Business Machines Corpor￾ation, Chicago, Illinois, US) was used for all statistical ana￾lysis. Shapiro-Wilk Test was used to assess for normality
and our data was normal distributed. Continuous data
were expressed as mean ± SD. Categorical data were re￾ported as frequencies and percentages. Paired student t
test was used for edema-based AAR and MI size compari￾son by different thresholding techniques and by different
sequences. T1 and T2 values in the MI zone and remote
myocardium were compared with unpaired student t-test.
Inter-method correlation was performed using the squared
Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R2
) and inter-method
agreement was assessed using intra-class correlation coeffi￾cient (ICC) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and
Bland-Altman analysis (expressed as bias ±2SD for limits
of agreement). All statistical tests were two-tailed, and
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The CMR was performed at 3 ± 1 days post-PPCI. Base￾line characteristics are listed in Table 1. The mean age of
the STEMI patients was 57 ± 13 years old and 22/28
(79%) were male. The mean MI size (MIConv) in the
STEMI patients was 25.1 ± 14.3%LV and the mean
edema-based AAR by T2 (AART2Man) was 41.5 ± 12.0%LV.
The myocardial salvage index in this cohort was
0.41 ± 0.28. Out of 448 AHA segments the TEI were as fol￾lows: no LGE: 262 (59%); 1–25%TEI: 32 (7%); 26–50%TEI:
60 (13%); 51–75% TEI: 45 (10%); and 76–100%TEI:
49 (11%). 5 patients had TIMI flow grade 3 and 3 pa￾tients had TMI flow grade 2 pre-PPCI. The MI size

in these 8 patients was significantly smaller than those
with TIMI flow 0/1 pre-PPCI (14.0(2.3–25.7)%LV versus
25.0(22.3–34.8)%LV, P = 0.04). All patients had areas of
hyperenhancement on the LGE areas of high signal on the
T1 and T2 maps.
Figure 2 illustrates examples from 3 patients for the
edema-based AAR by T2-mapping and native T1-
mapping and the detection of the acute MI size by
conventional LGE, synthetic MagIR LGE and syn￾thetic PSIR LGE, and post-contrast T1 maps.
T2 and T1 values in MI zone and remote myocardium
T2 in the MI zone was significantly higher than in the
remote myocardium (67 ± 7 ms versus 50 ± 3 ms,
P < 0.0001). Native T1 in the MI zone was also signifi￾cantly higher than in the remote myocardium
(1258 ± 57 ms versus 1041 ± 57 ms, P < 0.001). Post￾contrast T1 was significantly lower in the MI zone com￾pared to the remote myocardium (441 ± 48 ms versus
625 ± 22 ms, P < 0.001).
Edema-based AAR quantification
The Otsu technique failed in 8% of the maps with
extensive MVO and transmural LGE and the edema￾based AAR was manually delineated based on the
transmural extension of the MI for these slices. There
was an excellent correlation (R2 0.99) and agreement
(ICC 0.983 and 0.996 respectively) between AART2Man
and the 2 semi-automated techniques. AART2Otsu was
similar to AART2Man (41.7 ± 12.2%LV versus
41.5 ± 12.1%LV, P = 0.38) with no bias (0.2 ± 2.1%).
However, AART22SD was significantly larger than
AART2Man (42.2 ± 12.1%LV versus 41.5 ± 12.1%LV
P = 0.011) with a bias of 1.0 ± 2.6%. (Further details
in Table 2).
The same pattern was observed for T1-mapping. The
AART1Otsu was similar to AART1Manual (41.6 ± 11.9%LV
versus 41.0 ± 12.0%LV, P = 0.17) with no bias
(−0.6 ± 4.2%), and AART12SD was significantly higher
than AART1Manual (42.1 ± 12.2%LV versus
41.0 ± 12.0%LV, P = 0.005) with a small bias of
1.0 ± 3.9%. (Further details in Table 2).
Native T1-mapping performed as well as T2-mapping
in delineating the edema-based AAR (AART1Otsu
41.6 ± 11.9%LV versus AART2Otsu 41.7 ± 12.2%LV,
P = 0.72; R2 0.97; ICC 0.986(0.969–0.993); bias
−0.1 ± 4.2%LV). Table 2 and Fig. 3 provide further
details of the comparison between T2 and native T1-
mapping for the quantification of the edema-based
AAR using the different techniques. Figure 4 illus￾trates the comparison between AART2Otsu and
AART1Otsu.

by PPCI. The black arrows indicate the territory of the edema-based AAR on the T2 and native T1 maps and the red arrows indicate the territory of the
subendocardial MI (of different transmural extents) on the conventional and synthetic LGE images and post-contrast T1 maps. All these patients had
significant myocardial salvage but the areas of abnormality on the T2 and native T1 maps extended beyond the corresponding MI territory, indicating
edema in the salvaged myocardium

Acute MI size quantification
There was an excellent correlation (R2 0.96 to 0.99) and
inter-method agreement (ICC 0.964 to 0.996) between
conventional LGE and the other techniques. There was
minimal bias between MIConv and MISynthMagIR (bias:
0.2 ± 2.2%LV, P = 0.35), MIConv and MISynthPSIR (bias:
0.4 ± 2.2%LV, P = 0.060) and MIConv and MIT1Post2SD
(bias: 0.3 ± 1.8%LV, P = 0.10), with the latter having the
narrowest limits of agreement. However, MIT1PostOtsu
underestimated MI size when compared to MIConv (bias
−2.2 ± 6.0%LV, P = 0.001). Figure 3 shows the compari￾son of the various techniques used for MI size. Figure 5

CMR scan duration
The average time for the complete STEMI CMR
scan was 58 ± 4 min (including natural breaks be￾tween sequences). The average scanning time for the
T2 and T1 maps were 6 ± 1 min each and for LGE
it was 10 ± 1 min. Figure 6 illustrates the hypothet￾ical 15–20 min reduction in scanning time obtained
from potentially omitting T2-mapping and LGE
images to determine the edema-based AAR and MI
size, respectively.
Discussion
The main findings from our study are as follows: firstly,
the edema-based AAR can be accurately quantified using
native T1-mapping when compared to T2-mapping at
1.5 T; secondly, the acute MI size can be accurately
quantified from the post-contrast T1 maps (2-SD) and
the synthetic LGE images when compared to conven￾tional LGE imaging; and finally, using T1-mapping to
quantify the edema-based AAR and MI size may allow
one to omit T2 mapping and LGE image, thereby short￾ening the scanning time by 15–20 min.
We have previously shown that native T1-mapping can
accurately quantify the edema-based AAR at 3 T (analyzed
by the Otsu technique) when compared to T2-mapping [2].
Other groups [20, 21] have shown that the Otsu technique
also performed well on T2-weighted STIR images to detect
the edema-based AAR. However, when using the Otsu
technique, manual input is required when no edema is
present (using visual assessment of the colored maps and
cine MR images as reference), and when extensive MVO is
present on the maps. Langhans et al. [22] also demon￾strated that native T1-mapping and T2-mapping quantified
the AAR when compared to SPECT at 1.5 T, although a
direct comparison of T1 against T2 was not performed in
that study. We have now shown that native T1-mapping

can also accurately delineate the edema-based AAR when
compared to T2-mapping at 1.5 T in the clinical setting
and that the Otsu technique performed best against manual
contouring. The limits of agreement between T2 and
T1-mapping were ±4.2%LV, but narrower than our
previous study at 3 T (±5.1%LV). T2 mapping is sensitive
to the water content and therefore performs well in the
context of edema during acute MI. Inversion recovery￾based T1 mapping is influenced by T2 due to the use of a
steady-state free precession readout leading to a T2
dependent error in the estimation of T1 [11]. Furthermore,
a T2-dependent error also occurs due to the imperfect
inversion efficiency of the adiabatic radiofrequency prepar￾ation. These factors result in the T1 maps being
T2-weighting and sensitive to edema. Both T1 and T2 map￾ping are also equally affected by MVO and IMH [17].
Therefore, it is not surprising that they performed equally
well to quantify the AAR. The edema-based AAR by T2
mapping has been shown to be dynamic within the
first week of a STEMI [7, 23]. Whether the AAR by
T1-mapping will follow the same pattern or would be more
stable within the first week of a STEMI is not known and
warrants further investigations.
Messroghli et al. [9] have previously shown that post￾contrast T1 mapping could detect both acute and chronic
MI in a cohort of 24 patients but not all patients
underwent coronary angiography prior to CMR and only
21% showed evidence of reperfusion. Bauner et al. [10]
have subsequently shown that post-contrast T1 could ac￾curately detect chronic MI in 26 patients. Synthetic LGE
has also been shown to accurately quantify chronic MI
size in a small cohort of patients [12], but in this study,
only one short-axis LV image was analyzed. In our study,
we performed full LV coverage and we have shown that
post-contrast T1 maps can accurately quantify acute MI
size (using the semi-automated 2-SD threshold) when
compared to the reference standard in a cohort of
reperfused STEMI patients. Using the SD technique for
quantification can be variable depending on where the
ROI is drawn. To minimize the error associated with this,
we have used the automated ROI delineation option with
minimal manual adjustment when required. Furthermore,
we have also shown that the additional sets of IR images
that can be easily obtained from the post-contrast MOLLI
T1 maps can be used to obtain synthetic LGE images
(both MagIR and PSIR) and can accurately quantify acute
MI size. PSIR LGE is T1 weighted with retrospective nul￾ling of the remote myocardium thus being insensitive to
the inversion time used for acquisition [24]. With the
PSIR technique, the tissue with the longest TI nulls first,
irrespective of the TI used (post gadolinium, the remote
myocardium has the longest TI) and this sequence has

Fig. 6 a-d Duration of the CMR scan. a and b illustrate the duration for a comprehensive STEMI CMR acquisition protocol providing data on edema-based
AAR, intramyocardial hemorrhage, microvascular obstruction, MI size and ECV and on average takes around one hour to acquire. Based on the results from
this study, T1-mapping may allow T2-mapping and LGE to be omitted thereby shortening the scanning time by 15–20 min. c and d illustrates the options
of either doing T2-mapping and post-contrast T1-mapping or native T1 mapping and post-contrast T1 mapping depending on the research question

previously been shown to improve MI detection more ac￾curately by LGE compared to conventional MagIR LGE
images [25]. Therefore, the synthetic PSIR output could
complement post-contrast T1 maps for MI size quantifi￾cation without the need for conventional LGE images,
which requires the user to manually adjust the TI. Post￾contrast T1 maps have previously been used as the truth
standard for LGE imaging in the setting of cardiac amyl￾oidosis, where nulling of the myocardium is challenging
[26]. Therefore, post-contrast T1 mapping with the syn￾thetic LGE output may be useful to identify the pattern of
scarring in other pathologies with focal fibrosis such as
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sarcoidosis and myocarditis
and warrants further investigation.
A comprehensive CMR study in a reperfused acute
STEMI patient requiring data on the edema-based AAR,
intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH), MVO, MI size and
ECV, would take on average, an hour to perform. Based
on the results from this study, T2-mapping and conven￾tional LGE could be omitted - this would substantially
shorten the scanning time by 15–20 min (see Fig. 6a and
b) without compromising data acquisition. This approach
would significantly improve patient workflow, make the
CMR scan more tolerable to acute STEMI patients, and
may help minimize patient dropout in future clinical stud￾ies. In our center this could be achieved by omitting T1 or
T2 mapping and conventional LGE and performing the
short axis cine MR images post-contrast instead (that
could also provide another method for the AAR) [27] as
illustrated in Fig. 6. Native T1-mapping (for AAR) and
post-contrast T1 mapping (for LGE) approach has added
value in that the ECV can be derived (Fig. 6d), and this
may also be accelerated if the ECV maps are generated
inline [28]. Alternatively, If only data on edema-based
AAR and MI are required, the T1-mapping could be re￾placed by T2-mapping (Fig. 6c). The abbreviated protocol
could be further shortened in patients who cannot tolerate
long scans by omitting the T2* maps (for IMH) and EGE
images (for early MVO) and could bring down the scan
time to around 30 min. We recently showed that the pres￾ence of a hypo-intense core on the T1 maps or T2 maps
can detect IMH well and with good sensitivity (85–
88%) and specificity (85%) and therefore could be used
to detect IMH in situations when T2* mapping cannot
be performed or is not available [17].
The appearance of the synthetic MagIR and PSIR is
noisy in regions such as air or lungs where the signal
to noise ratio is low and the T1 estimates are noisy.
This appearance of increased noise in these non￾tissue regions is similar to the appearance of PSIR
LGE images that results due to correction of surface
coil intensities. Surface coil correction is also known
as normalization and is generally accompanied by
noise amplification in non-tissue regions. Various
schemes are often employed to improve the appear￾ance by softening the normalization in these regions.
However, these methods may result in some degree of
error in tissue regions. This issue, albeit mostly
cosmetic, was not addressed in this article and re￾presents a potential impediment to acceptance by
clinicians.
Limitations of study
The conventional LGE scan (acquired 10–15 min
post contrast) and post-contrast-T1 maps (acquired
15–20 min post contrast) were acquired 5 min apart.
But despite this, there was no difference in MI size.
The TI range for the IR images generated in-line
from the T1 maps was quite wide (200 ms to
975 ms and at 25 ms increments). But off-line post￾processing was not necessary and synthetic MagIR
LGE images (Fig. 2) were interpretable and
performed as well as conventional LGE for MI size
quantification. Our sample size was small but still
larger than previously published studies on the
edema-based AAR by T1 and T2 mapping [2] and
synthetic LGE [12]. We used the edema as a surro￾gate marker for the AAR, although controversy
exists over whether it exists at all [6] or there is a
bimodal or unimodal pattern of edema in the first
week of an MI [7, 23]. We used 2 different LGE
read-outs (FLASH LGE in 22 patients and MOCO￾FB LGE in 6 patients) for MI size quantification but
both these sequences have been shown to perform
equally well for MI size quantification [29]. For some
centers not performing such a comprehensive study
for STEMI, their scanning time may not be short￾ened significantly as they would still need to wait
15 min to perform the post-contrast T1 maps.
However, they would have the benefit of having 3
outputs to quantify MI size by simply performing
post-contrast T1 mapping instead of conventional
LGE without having to manually null the remote
myocardium. There was a period of 3 months over￾lap between recruitment of patients in this study
and our previous study on T1/T2 at 3 T [2] (part of
a positron emission tomography (PET)/MR study)
and there may have been an element of selection
bias with those >45 years of age and without a
history of diabetes being more likely recruited to the
latter studies [2, 30]. We have previously shown that
the T1 values in the remote myocardium is higher
that normal in the acute phase of a STEMI when
compared to controls and this might have affected
the n-SD technique where an ROI in the remote
myocardium is used as reference. There is a regional
variation in T1 [31] and T2 [32] values from base to
apex, partly contributed by thinner walls and more
Bulluck et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2017) 19:57 Page 9 of 11

partial volume effects towards the apex. However, we
did not use one cut-off value as threshold for the
whole LV but analysis was done on a per-slice basis
(ROIs for the 2SD technique were drawn on each
slice and the Otsu technique was applied on each
slice) to obtain the extent of hyperenhancement.
Only around a third of our cohort had the conven￾tional cardiovascular risk factors and therefore these
findings apply to this select cohort of STEMI
patients only and further studies are required to
assess whether synthetic LGE derived from post￾contrast T1 maps could be useful in a wider range
of patients with STEMI and other pathologies.
Conclusions
T1-mapping can accurately quantify both the edema￾based AAR (using native T1 maps) and acute MI
size (using post-contrast T1 maps) in this select
group of low-risk STEMI patients, obviating the
need to perform T2 maps and LGE imaging, thereby
shortening the duration of a comprehensive CMR
study without significantly compromising on data
acquisition. This approach would make the CMR
scan more tolerable to acute STEMI patients.
