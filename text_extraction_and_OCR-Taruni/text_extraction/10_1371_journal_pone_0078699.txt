Abstract
Background/Aims: The Japanese National Hospital Organization evidence-based medicine (EBM) Study group for Adverse
effects of Corticosteroid therapy (J-NHOSAC) is a Japanese hospital-based cohort study investigating the safety of the initial
use of glucocorticoids (GCs) in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Using the J-NHOSAC registry, the
purpose of this observational study is to analyse the rates, characteristics and associated risk factors of intracellular
infections in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases who were initially treated with GCs.
Methodology/Principal Findings: A total 604 patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases treated with GCs were
enrolled in this registry between April 2007 and March 2009. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to determine
independent risk factors for serious intracellular infections with covariates including sex, age, co-morbidity, laboratory data,
use of immunosuppressants and dose of GCs. Survival was analysed according to the Kaplan-Meier method and was
assessed by the log-rank test. There were 127 serious infections, including 43 intracellular infections, during 1105.8 patient￾years of follow-up. The 43 serious intracellular infections resulted in 8 deaths. After adjustment for covariates, diabetes
(Odds ratio [OR]: 2.5, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.1–5.9), lymphocytopenia (!1000/ml, OR: 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.2) and
use of high-dose (§30 mg/day) GCs (OR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.1–5.3) increased the risk of intracellular infections. Survival curves
showed lower intracellular infection-free survival rate in patients with diabetes, lymphocytopaenia and high-dose GCs
treatments.
Conclusions/Significance: Patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases were at high risk of developing intracellular
infection during initial treatment with GCs. Our findings provide background data on the risk of intracellular infections of
patients with autoimmune diseases. Clinicians showed remain vigilant for intracellular infections in patients with
autoimmune diseases who are treated with GCs.

Introduction
Despite the considerable benefits of glucocorticoids (GCs) in
controlling serious inflammation and improving the functional
status of a plethora of disorders [1], serious adverse effects dampen
the enthusiasm for their use, particularly long-term [2]. Bacterial
and fungal infections are the most common serious infections
occurring in patients receiving GCs [3], although intracellular
infections are also a concern [4]. Moderate- to high-dose GC
therapy leads to an increased risk of opportunistic infections,
including intracellular infections [5,6]. However, there is little
information regarding the rate of intracellular infection in a large
series of patients receiving GCs in clinical practice. Most studies of
GCs toxicity are retrospective and risk factors for intracellular
infections have not been completely elucidated in prospective
studies. Because immunosuppression induced by GCs is broad, a
wide variety of pathogens can infect hosts treated with GCs [7].
Thus, the clinician must anticipate both usual and unusual
infections, including intracellular infections. There is a paucity of
well-controlled studies detailing the infectious risks, particularly
concerning intracellular infections, and much of the information is
in the form of case reports and literature reviews [8,9]. In addition,
many of these reports offer little detail regarding the dose or
duration of GC administration.

therapy (J-NHOSAC) is a Japanese non-interventional prospective
study, based on a nationwide registry of severe adverse events
(AEs) in newly diagnosed autoimmune disease patients treated
with moderate doses of GCs in a clinical setting [10]. This original
strategy can be used to determine the exact incidence of serious
infections and their risk factors and using the J-NHOSAC registry
we previously reported that infections were the most common AEs
occurring in newly diagnosed autoimmune disease patients, who
were initially treated with GCs [10]. The aim of this study was to
describe cases of intracellular infections, and to identify risk factors
for their occurrence.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Study design
Patients were eligible for the study if they were initially treated
with GCs for a recently diagnosed (within 4 weeks prior to study
entry) autoimmune disease using established criteria. The cohort
start date was defined as the time of initiation of the first GC
prescription. The autoimmune diseases registered in this study
were as follows. Rheumatic diseases: SLE (systemic lupus
erythematosus), MCTD (mixed connective tissue disease), poly￾myositis, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, Behc¸et disease, systemic
scleroderma, AOSD (adult onset Still disease), Sjo¨gren syndrome,
rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune bullous diseases, and anaphy￾lactoid purpura. Neurological diseases: multiple sclerosis, myas￾thenia gravis, and CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyradiculoneuropathy). Gastro-hepatobiliary diseases: ulcerative
colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, and PBC
(primary biliary cirrhosis). Interstitial lung diseases: idiopathic
interstitial pneumonia and collagen vascular disease preceded by
interstitial pneumonia. Primary glomerular diseases: rapidly
progressive glomerulonephritis, chronic glomerulonephritis, and
nephrotic syndrome.
A total of 604 patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune
disease were enrolled between April 1, 2006 and March 31, 2008,
and regularly followed concerning the occurrence of GC-related
adverse effects. The observation period ended on March 31 2009.
Before implementation of this study, institutional review board and
ethics committee approvals of the protocol and the consent to
participate in the study and consent to publish were obtained from
each of the participating patients. The study was approved by the
ethical committees of the National Hospital Organization (NHO)
central internal review board (No. 0512014, 2006). Written
informed consent was obtained from each individual.
Data collection
Data from all participating physicians were entered into the J￾NHOSAC database at the data centre of the International
Medical Center of Japan in Tokyo, Japan via the HOSPnet
internet system. Serious infections were defined as those that led to
hospitalization or death or required intravenous antibiotic
treatment. If a serious infection was identified from the patient’s
medical records provided by participating doctors. If not already
provided, additional information regarding all serious infections
was requested, including causative organism.
Data on study entry
The past comorbid condition of each patient was reviewed by
each of the principle physicians. These conditions included renal,
neurological, endocrine, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as
well as cancer and stroke. In addition, the incidences of specific
conditions, including pre-existing pulmonary tuberculosis, hepati￾tis viral infection (HBV, HCV), diabetes, hyperlipidaemia,
arrhythmia and performance status (Karnofsky score) were
assessed. The physicians also provided information on smoking
or drinking habits and history of tuberculosis (TB). At entry,
patients underwent chest X-ray and were screened for surface
hepatitis B virus antigen (HBs Ag) and anti-HCV antibodies.
Outcome variables
At the start of the study, standardized lists were used to
document AEs, which were classified using the System Organ
Class (SOC) of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA; version 11.1). All physicians documented episodes of
infection requiring medical care and death certificates and the
causes of deaths that occurred during the follow-up periods.
Serious infections occurring during the observation periods were
counted. Serious infections ($ grade 3, by common terminology of
Adverse Events v3.0 [CTCAE]), were defined as life-threatening,
requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotic therapy, or
leading to significant disability/incapacity1 [11]. Infections were
coded by anatomic site and by causal organism. Cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection was defined as CMV end-organ disease, in which
the signs and symptoms of affected organs (pneumonia, gastroin￾testinal disease, or hepatitis) plus CMV antigenaemia were
present. The diagnosis of CMV antigenaemia was defined by a
positive CMV PP65 antigenaemia assay [12]. A diagnosis of
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was made according to the
established criteria for PCP [13]. The diagnosis of PCP was
considered presumptive if a patient fulfilled the clinical and
radiographic conditions in the absence of evidence of other
infectious diseases and in the presence of either a positive PCR test
for Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA (qualitative PCR analysis by SRL,
Tokyo, Japan) or increased serum b-D-glucan levels above the
upper limit of normal (ULN) (Fungitec G test MK; Seikagaku,
Tokyo, Japan) and responded to standard treatments for PCP with
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) or pentamidine
isethionate. Both the PCR test for P. jirovecii DNA and the serum
BDG test are commercially available, validated, and officially
approved as clinical laboratory tests by the Ministry of Health,
Labour, and Welfare in Japan.
Follow-up data
Patients were followed up every 3 months by the chief physician
for each of the NHO hospitals, who collected clinical findings
(disease activity, severity, performance status, blood pressure, body
weight) and laboratory data (complete blood cell count, biochem￾istry, and urinalysis). The telephone interview concerning the
health assessment and the presence of GCs-related AEs was
conducted against few patients who were moved or transferred to
another hospital at the end of cohort. However, overall outcome
was not available from 14 patients (2.3%) at the end of study. In
statistical analysis, we excluded these participants without final
outcome data.
Medications
Details of GCs, immunosuppressants, and biologics were
recorded at each visit, including the route of administration and
dose. We categorized GC exposure according to the mean daily
dose throughout the follow-up period for each patient. We
calculated ‘‘dose equivalents’’ of prednisolone as follows: 1 mg of
prednisolone = 5 mg of cortisone = 4 mg of hydrocortisone
= 1 mg of prednisone = 0.8 mg of triamcinolone = 0.8 mg of
methylprednisolone = 0.15 mg of dexamethasone = 0.15 mg of
betamethasone [14].

Statistical analysis
We identified the risk factors of intracellular infections by
univariate and multivariate Cox-proportional hazard models
analysis The variables included in the analysis were: age, sex,
types of primary autoimmune diseases, comorbidities (diabetes,
renal diseases, cardiovascular diseases and interstitial lung
diseases), medications (average dose of GC, the use of immuno￾suppressive agents) and performance status (Karnofsky score) or
laboratory data on entry (serum albumin, serum IgG, lymphocyte
counts). Factors included in the Cox-proportional multivariate
hazard model were those associated with the status (case or
control) of univariate analysis with a significance level of p,0.05.
The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to
identify the best threshold value for continuous variables that were
predictors of the occurrence intracellular infections. Both univar￾iate and multivariate analyses were performed, using the
occurrence of at least one serious infection during the follow-up
period as the outcome. Results are expressed as odds ratios (ORs)
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Qualitative variables
were compared using the chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test
when appropriate), and quantitative variables were compared
using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Two-sided p values less than 0.05
were considered statistically significant. The analysis was conduct￾ed using SAS (version 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

adalimumab (n = 3) 87.7 mg 62.2 mg/month (288.1653.6 days).
Thirty four patients had experienced previous tuberculosis
infection. Prophylaxis was performed in 69 patients using isoniazid
(INH) and in 138 patients using TMP/SMX.
Incidence of intracellular infections
During the overall follow up periods, 127 serious infections that
required hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotics and/or
resulted in death, occurred in 71 patients. The incidence rate of
serious infections was 114.8 events/1,000 person-years. These
serious infections (n = 127) included 43 intracellular infections.
Pathogens identified in 33 patients with intracellular infections are
listed in Table 2 and included CMV (n = 14), herpes zoster (n = 7),
Epstein–Barr virus (n = 1), P. jirovecii infection (n = 7), Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (n = 2) non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM, n = 1)
and Listeria monocytogenes (n = 1). The site of these intracellular
infections is listed in Table 2. A multi-intracellular infection was
reported in eight patients. The intracellular infections occurred
earlier and faster than normal infections and 50% of intracellular
infections occurred within 4 months of starting GCs. In contrast,
non-intracellular serious infections occurred gradually compared
with serious intracellular infections (Figure 1).
Risk factors for intracellular infections
The case-control study involved 33 patients with serious
intracellular infections and 559 patients without serious intracel￾lular infection. To identify differences in risk factors that
contributed to the development of intracellular or non-intracellu￾lar infections, we compared baseline data between patients with
serious intracellular infections and those with non-intracellular
serious infections. The positive predictive value (PPV) of mean
steroid dose to identify intracellular infections was shown in the
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (Figure 2). Cut-off
value of steroid dose was made at 30 mg/day based on this ROC
curve analysis and this value was entered into the Cox hazard
model. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed a significant
increased risk of serious intracellular infections with male gender,
the presence of diabetes, use of high-dose (§30 mg/day) of GCs,
lower Karnofsky score and lymphocytopenia (#1000/ml). No
significant association was found for the use of immunosuppres￾sants or biologics as risk factors. In the multivariate Cox regression
analysis, high-dose (§30 mg/day) of GCs (OR = 2.4 [95% CI,
1.1–5.3], the presence of diabetes (OR = 2.5 [95% CI, 1.1–5.9])
and lymphocytopenia (,1000/ml, OR = 2.5 [95% CI, 1.2–5.2])
were significantly associated with an increased risk for serious
intracellular infections (Table 3).
Survival curves
Patients with serious intracellular infections were found to have
significant associations to diabetes or low lymphocyte counts
compared with those with non-intracellular serious infections.
Therefore, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for the
occurrence of the first serious intracellular or non-intracellular -
infections stratified by the presence of high dose GCs (§30 mg/
day), (Figure 3A), diabetes (Figure 3B) and lymphocytopenia
(,1000/ml, Figure 3C). Reduced survival time to the occurrence
of first intracellular infections was significant in patients receiving
high dose GCs, diabetes or lymphocytopenia. In contrast, reduced
survival time to the occurrence of first non-intracellular serious
infections was significant only in patients receiving high dose GCs,
but not in patients with diabetes or lymphocytopenia.
Discussion
GCs are still widely used in the treatment of autoimmune
diseases and are thought to be associated with increased risk of
infection as well as other well-established adverse effects [15].
However, the extent to which GC contributes to the increased risk
of intracellular infections is not completely understood. Despite the
fact that intracellular infections rank high amongst common causes
of death in immunological diseases [16], they have not been
studied specifically in autoimmune diseases. In the current study,
we showed that the overall rate of intracellular infections is high in
patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases treated with
GCs.

Our study showed that intracellular infections occurred more
frequently and quickly (most within 4 months from the start of
GCs) among patients with autoimmune diseases and some
intracellular infections contributed to morbidity and mortality. A
high frequency of opportunistic infections complicating autoim￾mune diseases has been reported previously [17]. The augmented
risk is due in part to the underlying immune dysfunction associated
with these disorders [18], but also due to immunosuppressive
therapies used to treat these disorders. It is often difficult to
separate intracellular infections because of underlying diseases
(which may be immunosuppressive) and infections related to GC￾induced immunosuppression. However, the type of primary
autoimmune disease was not identified as a risk factor for
intracellular infection. In contrast, we demonstrated that the
presence of diabetes, lymphocytopaenia and the initial use of high￾dose GCs (§30 mg/day), elderly age and male gender were
independent predictors for serious intracellular infections in
patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases.
To date, there have been few studies evaluating the exposure of
GCs in newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases and reporting the
rate of intracellular infection. A number of published papers have
evaluated the risk of infections in connective tissue diseases
[5,19,20], where the exposure of GC, outcomes and risk
measurements were not consistent across the studies. Methodo￾logical differences between previous studies and ours are that
previous investigators used retrospective analysis or hospitalization
record techniques to ascertain infection occurrence. In our study,
we reviewed each patient’s complete medical records and obtained
objective confirmatory evidence of infection including microbio￾logic cultures and radiographic imaging prospectively. Use of these
detailed medical records enabled us to obtain information
regarding a broad range of pathogens and infection sites.
The striking incidence of intracellular infections seen in our
study suggests the presence of cell-mediated immune deficiency in
patients with autoimmune diseases receiving moderate-doses of
GCs [21]. From epidemiologic studies, treatment with a daily dose
of less than 5 mg of prednisolone or equivalent slightly increased
risk of infection [22], whereas daily doses between 20 to 40 mg
caused a marked increased risk [23]. However, the true incidence
of intracellular infections or their risk factors have not been
adequately demonstrated in a prospective study. One of the
objectives of this study was to identify possible baseline risk factors
for the development of serious intracellular infections in autoimmune
disease patients treated with moderate-doses of GCs (.30 mg/day,

mean of first month). Previous studies identified high-doses of GCs,
lymphocytopaenia, use of immunosuppressants, low IgG levels and
diabetes as independent variables associated with increased risk of
intracellular infection [6,16,24–27]. Although the differences
between these studies and our results are significant (design, disease
evaluated, doses of GCs and variables analysed), it is noteworthy
that both studies identified lymphocytopaenia, high doses of GCs
and diabetes as independent variables associated with increased risk
of intracellular infections [6,26–28]. However, we found no
association between concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents
or biologics and an increased risk of intracellular infections. How
GCs alter the host immune system and influence the development of
infection is incompletely understood. Human host immunity against
intracellular pathogens is dependent on effective cell-mediated
immune responses [29]. GCs can impair phagocyte functions and
suppress cell-mediated immunity, possibly increasing the risk of
intracellular infections [1].
In general, diabetes is associated with an increased susceptibility
to infection [30]. However, no adequate data exists for the effects
of diabetes on risk of intracellular infection. Our study clearly
demonstrated that the presence of diabetes is a risk factor for
intracellular infection in patients treated with GCs. This may be
due to abnormalities of the host immune response, particularity
defects of neutrophils, macrophages, chemotaxis, adhesion and
intracellular killing that are attributed to hyperglycaemia and may
explain reduced phagocytosis [31]. Disorders of cell-mediated
immunity are often associated with CMV and PCP. CMV is the
most common opportunistic pathogen detected in organ trans￾plant recipients and can cause a variety of clinical symptoms in
patients with disordered cell-mediated immunity including pneu￾monitis colitis, hepatitis and retinitis [9]. An increased risk of PCP
in association with lymphocytopaenia has been similarly reported
in patients with connective tissue diseases [32,33]. Clinicians
should maintain a high degree of suspicion for the development of
unusual intracellular infections in patients receiving moderate
doses of GCs. Initiation of GC therapy requires careful pre￾treatment evaluation. Screening for latent tuberculosis, diabetes,
cellular-immune dysfunction (lymphocytopaenia) and consider￾ation of prophylaxis should be considered [21,34]. Evaluation and
management of suspected intracellular infections in patients
receiving newly administered GC treatment must include aggres￾sive diagnostic approaches and empiric treatment.
Our study has a number of limitations that should be
considered. We analysed only variables related to cellular or
humoral immune monitoring, without considering other aspects
that have demonstrated influence on the incidence of intracellular
infections. The determination of laboratory or clinical findings was
performed exclusively at baseline, which may hinder analysis of
steroid therapy modulation of patient immune status. Further￾more, we did not perform a comparison with patients not treated
with GCs. Therefore, we could not compare patients treated with
GCs or other immunosuppressive agents alone. The nature of the
study design did not allow us to exclude completely the role of
potential confounders, such as disease severity, whereby patients
with more-severe disease (and thus at high risk of infection) are
more likely to receive steroids, and thus is a major concern.
However, this potential bias was unavoidable in our observational
study. Future well-designed prospective studies are required to
confirm our findings.
In conclusion, substantial numbers of intracellular infections
occurred in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases,
who were treated with GCs. We showed that patient baseline

demographics, such as concomitant diabetes, lymphocytopaenia,
and initial high-dose GCs (.30 mg/day) might predict an
increased incidence of intracellular infections. Our findings suggest
strategies for efficient pre-treatment risk screening, intensive
surveillance, prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy for intracellular
infections in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases,
which may eventually lead to the improvement of prognosis and
survival.
