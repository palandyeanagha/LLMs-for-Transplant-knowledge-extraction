Cardiac progenitor cells are a potential source of cell therapy for heart failure. Although recent studies have
shown that transplantation of cardiac stem/progenitor cells improves function of infarcted hearts, the pre￾cise mechanisms of the improvement in function remain poorly understood. The present study demonstrates
that transplantation of sheets of clonally expanded stem cell antigen 1–positive (Sca-1–positive) cells (CPCs)
ameliorates cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction in mice.CPCefficiently differentiated into cardio￾myocytes and secreted various cytokines, including soluble VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1). Secreted sVCAM-1 induced
migration of endothelial cells and CPCs and prevented cardiomyocyte death from oxidative stress through
activation of Akt, ERK, and p38 MAPK. Treatment with antibodies specific for very late antigen-4 (VLA-4),
a receptor of sVCAM-1, abolished the effects of CPC-derived conditioned medium on cardiomyocytes and
CPCs in vitro and inhibited angiogenesis, CPC migration, and survival in vivo, which led to attenuation of
improved cardiac function following transplantation of CPC sheets. These results suggest that CPC trans￾plantation improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction through cardiomyocyte differentiation and
paracrine mechanisms mediated via the sVCAM-1/VLA-4 signaling pathway.
Introduction
Accumulating evidence has suggested that myocardial regen￾eration is a promising therapy for various heart diseases (1). 
Recently, several groups, including our own, have reported that 
adult hearts contain cardiac stem/progenitor cells that can dif￾ferentiate into functional cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo 
(2–6). Transplantation of cardiac stem/progenitor cells has been 
shown to improve cardiac function via newly formed cardiomyo￾cytes and blood vessels (2, 7). On the other hand, it has been 
reported that when noncardiac stem cells are transplanted, para￾crine factors play a major role in the improvement of cardiac 
function (8, 9). Several preclinical reports and clinical trials have 
demonstrated that intracoronary or intramyocardial injection 
of bone marrow–derived cells attenuates cardiac dysfunction 
following acute and chronic myocardial infarction (MI) (10–12). 
However, it is not known whether cardiac stem/progenitor cells 
are superior to other noncardiac stem/progenitor cells. Fur￾thermore, it remains unclear to what extent paracrine effects or 
transdifferentiation of cardiac stem/progenitor cells contributes 
to beneficial effects on cardiac function.
Transplanted cells are the source of paracrine factors or newly 
formed cardiomyocytes, and the survival of grafted cells is a critical 
issue. The majority of the grafted cells have been reported to dis￾appear within 1 week after transplantation when directly injected 
into ischemic hearts (9, 13), suggesting that alternative strategies 
to facilitate survival of grafted cells are required. We developed 
temperature-responsive culture dishes that were covalently grafted 
with the temperature-responsive polymer poly(N-isopropylacryl￾amide) (PIPAAm) (14). Lowering the temperature induces a rapid 
surface transition from hydrophobic (cell adhesive) to hydrophil￾ic (non–cell adhesive), which results in the release of contiguous 
viable cell sheets with full preservation of cell-to-cell connections 
and adhesion proteins without using any enzymatic digestion 
(15). To date, cell sheet transplantations of skeletal myoblasts 
(16), mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (17), 
and menstrual blood (18) have been reported to improve cardiac 
function in animal MI models. However, the precise mechanisms 
of the improvement, which include mutual interactions between 
host tissue and transplanted cells, remain poorly understood.
The present study demonstrates that transplanted cell sheets 
of clonally expanded stem cell antigen 1–positive (Sca-1–positive) 
cells (CPCs) differentiated into cardiomyocytes and vascular cells 
and prevented cardiac remodeling after MI. CPCs secreted soluble 
VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1), which facilitated engraftment and migration 
of CPCs from cell sheets into host myocardium and improved car￾diac function after MI via angiogenic and cardioprotective effects 
mediated by paracrine mechanisms.

sisted of several cell populations, including cardiac stem/progeni￾tor cells, hematopoietic cells, and endothelial cells (ref. 4 and our 
unpublished observations), clonal cells were initially established 
from cardiac Sca-1–positive cells. A total of 104 primary isolated 
Sca-1–positive cells derived from adult murine hearts were plat￾ed onto 10-cm culture dishes. After repeated limited dilutions, 
clonal cell lines were established. The efficiency of cloning was 
approximately 0.1%. The clonal cells were expanded for more than 
500 population doublings (Figure 1A). Flow cytometric analysis 
revealed that almost 100% of cells expressed Sca-1, CD29, and 
CD44, approximately 20% of cells expressed CD34, and no cells 
expressed CD31, CD45, and c-kit throughout the culture pas￾sages (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material 
available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI37456DS1), sug￾gesting that the clonal cells were not homogenous. Under culture 
conditions of 80% confluency, the clonal cells expressed cardiac 
transcription factors, such as Nkx2.5 and GATA4 (Figure 1B), but 
not cardiac contractile proteins. These cell phenotypes remained 
unchanged throughout the culture passages. Gene profiles and 
cell-surface marker analyses revealed that CPCs were similar to pri￾mary isolated Sca-1–positive cells in analyses previously reported 
(4). Therefore, CPCs possessed features almost identical to those 
of intrinsic cardiac stem/progenitor cells. When CPCs were cul￾tured under confluent conditions for 4 weeks, expression levels 
of Nkx2.5 and GATA4 were upregulated and expressions of myo￾cyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), 
β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and sarcomeric α-actinin were 
detected at mRNA and protein levels (Figure 1, B and C). These 
results suggested that CPCs differentiated into immature cardio￾myocytes in vitro. However, the cells did not exhibit spontaneous 
beating. To examine the cardiac differentiation potency of CPCs 
in vivo, 2.0 × 106 CPCs labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) 
were injected directly into the infarcted myocardium within 5 min￾utes after left coronary artery ligation. At 4 weeks after transplan￾tation, several GATA4-expressing RFP+ cells were recognized in the 
border areas and some RFP+ cells expressed sarcomeric α-actinin 
in a fine striated pattern, which suggested that CPCs differenti￾ated into mature cardiomyocytes in vivo (Figure 1, D and E). How￾ever, transplanted CPC-derived RFP expression in the infarcted 
heart was very weak 1 week after transplantation compared with 
immediately after transplantation (Supplemental Figure 2). These 
results suggest that direct intramyocardial injection is not an ideal 
method for efficient engraftment.
Cell sheet transplantation. To elucidate the functional benefits of 
CPC transplantation in the infarcted heart compared with effects 
of noncardiac stem/progenitor cells, cell sheet transplantation 
methods were utilized. RFP+ CPCs or adipose tissue–derived 
mesenchymal cells (ATMCs) isolated from GFP mice were cultured 
on temperature-responsive culture dishes at 37°C. The monolay￾ered cell sheet was collected by decreasing the temperature at which 
it was cultured to 20°C. Final cell counts and areas of monolayered 
cell sheets prior to transplantation were 2.0 ± 0.2 × 106 cells and 
80.1 ± 3.3 mm2 in CPCs and 1.9 ± 0.1 × 106 cells and 79.3 ± 2.0 mm2
in ATMCs, respectively (n = 5). The mice were randomly assigned 
into 3 groups: mice transplanted with monolayered CPCs (CPC 
group), mice transplanted with monolayered ATMCs (ATMC 
group), and mice that were not transplanted (MI group). Within 
5 minutes after left coronary artery ligation, monolayered CPC or 
ATMC sheets were transplanted over the infarcted area and cardiac 
function was examined by echocardiography every week. Echocar￾diographic analysis revealed that LV diastolic dimension (LVDd) 
and LV systolic dimension (LVDs) were significantly decreased at 
4 weeks and fractional shortening (FS) was markedly improved 3 
weeks after transplantation in the CPC group compared with the 
MI and ATMC groups. These results suggested that transplanta￾tion of CPC sheets inhibited cardiac remodeling and improved 
cardiac function following MI (Figure 2A). Furthermore, LV end￾diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and +dp/dt, as determined by cath￾eter, were markedly improved in the CPC group compared with 
the remaining 2 groups at 4 weeks (Figure 2B). In contrast, in the 
ATMC group, LVDs was significantly smaller and FS was bet￾ter 1 week after transplantation compared with the MI and CPC 
groups. However, these favorable effects were not observed 2 weeks 
after transplantation, and cardiac remodeling and dysfunction 
progressed in a manner similar to that in the MI group (Figure 
2A). The fibrotic area, which was evaluated by Masson trichrome 
staining 4 weeks after transplantation, was significantly smaller 
in the CPC group compared with the other 2 groups (Figure 3A). 
At 1 week after transplantation, more vWF-positive blood vessels 
were observed in the border area of the ATMC group than in the 
MI and CPC groups (Figure 3B). At 4 weeks, a greater number of 
vessels were detected in the CPC group than in the MI and ATMC 
groups (Figure 3C). Furthermore, when lectin perfusion assay 
was performed at 4 weeks, more lectin-positive blood vessels were 
detected in the border area of the CPC group compared with the 
remaining 2 groups (Supplemental Figure 4). In contrast, there 
were few inflammatory cells in the border area of each group at 4 
weeks (Supplemental Figure 5).
Cell survival and differentiation. Immunohistochemical analysis 
showed that many transplanted CPCs were present in the middle 
of the LV wall, including the normal and injured areas (normal 
area, 28.3 ± 9.7 cells/mm2; injured area, 235.9 ± 75.1 cells/mm2), 
after 4 weeks (Figure 4, A–C). This suggested that CPCs migrated 
from the epicardial cell sheet into the ventricular myocardium 
following transplantation. Conversely, GFP+ ATMCs were not 
observed in the myocardium (data not shown). Western blot 
analysis, using Abs against fluorescent proteins, revealed that 
approximately 20% of transplanted CPCs remained 4 weeks 
after transplantation, whereas only approximately 0.8% of trans￾planted ATMCs remained (Supplemental Figure 3). Furthermore, 
approximately 30% of RFP+ cells expressed sarcomeric α-actinin 
in a fine striated pattern, and some RFP+ cells also formed blood 
vessel structures (Figure 4, D–F). Because cardiomyocytes have 
the ability to fuse with surrounding noncardiomyocytes (19), the 
possibility that CPCs acquired cardiomyogenic features following 
fusion with existing cardiomyocytes was examined. When RFP+
CPC sheets were transplanted into hearts of GFP mice immedi￾ately following MI, approximately half of the α-actinin–expressing 
cells expressed GFP in injured areas 4 weeks after transplantation 
(Supplemental Figure 6, A, B, and E). In the normal areas, all of the 
α-actinin–expressing RFP+ cells expressed GFP (Supplemental Fig￾ure 6, C–E). To further ensure the occurrence of cell fusion, sheets 
of nonlabeled CPCs derived from male mice were transplanted 
into the infarcted hearts of female mice. At 4 weeks after trans￾plantation, cells exhibiting a fine striated pattern possessed 3 X 
chromosomes and a Y chromosome in the nucleus (Supplemen￾tal Figure 7). These findings suggested that CPCs differentiated 
into cardiomyocytes via cell fusion–dependent and –independent 
mechanisms. Because approximately 20% of transplanted CPCs 
remained at 4 weeks (Supplemental Figure 3), approximately

4.0 × 105 out of approximately 2.0 × 106 transplanted CPCs were 
thought to survive and undergo engraftment. As approximately 
30% of survived CPCs expressed cardiac contractile proteins (Fig￾ure 4, C and E), approximately 1.2 × 105 CPCs were estimated to 
differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Since approximately half of the 
cardiac protein–expressing cells resulted from cell fusion with

existing cardiomyocytes (Supplemental Figure 6E), CPC sheet 
transplantation was estimated to create approximately 0.6 × 105
new cardiomyocytes in the entire heart. The number of cardiomyo￾cytes in an adult murine heart has been estimated to be 3 × 106
(20). Therefore, approximately 5% of cardiomyocytes were regener￾ated and might have contributed to improved cardiac function by 
CPC sheet transplantation.
Secretion of growth factors. Recent reports have suggested that cell 
transplantation improves cardiac function after MI through the 
release of humoral factors (8, 9). Analyses of conditioned medium 
(CM) from CPCs and ATMCs using a cytokine Ab array revealed 
that sVCAM-1 was more abundant in CPCs, while VEGF was dom￾inantly expressed in ATMCs (Table 2). Western blot analysis of 
whole-cell lysates and ELISA of CM confirmed altered expressions 
of VCAM-1/sVCAM-1 and VEGF between CPCs 
and ATMCs (Figure 5A). VCAM-1 expression was 
almost identical among the 3 groups at 1 week. 
However, at 4 weeks after transplantation, expres￾sion levels remained high in the CPC group com￾pared with the other 2 groups (Figure 5B). Time 
course of VCAM-1 expression was consistent with 
improved cardiac function (Figure 2A). Conversely, 
VEGF expression was significantly upregulated at 1 
week in the ATMC group compared with the other 
groups. However, at 4 weeks, expression levels were 
similar among the 3 groups (Figure 5B). This was 
consistent with observations that transplanted 
ATMC sheets improved cardiac function at 1 week but not at 4 
weeks (Figure 2A). The concentrations of sVCAM-1 and VEGF in 
peripheral blood remained unchanged in all groups 1 and 4 weeks 
after transplantation (Supplemental Figure 8).
CPC-derived sVCAM-1–mediated angiogenesis and cardioprotective 
effects. CPC-derived CM and sVCAM-1 induced greater endothelial 
cell migration and tube formation compared with control medi￾um (Figure 5, C and D). sVCAM-1–depleted CM, which was 
obtained from CPCs transfected with VCAM-1–specific microRNA 
(miRNA) plasmid vector (Supplemental Figure 9, A and B), 
induced significantly less endothelial cell migration (Figure 5C) 
and tube formation (Figure 5D) compared with CPC-derived CM. 
This suggested that angiogenic activity of CPC-derived CM was 
mediated at least in part by sVCAM-1. Subsequently, the protective

effects of CPC-derived CM and sVCAM-1 on cardiomyocytes were 
analyzed. When cardiomyocytes were pretreated with CPC-derived 
CM or sVCAM-1, H2O2-induced damage of cardiomyocytes was 
significantly reduced (Figure 6A). The cardioprotective effects of 
CPC-derived CM were abolished by pretreatment of cardiomyo￾cytes with Abs against very late antigen-4 (VLA-4, also known as 
α4β1 integrin), a principal coreceptor of sVCAM-1 (Figure 6A), or 
sVCAM-1–depleted CM (Figure 6B). These results suggested a cru￾cial role for sVCAM-1/VLA-4 in cardiomyocyte survival.
Integrin-mediated signals influence cardioprotective effects of sVCAM-1. 
Integrin-mediated signaling induces cell migration and sur￾vival by activating various kinases, such as focal adhesion kinase 
(FAK), Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK (21, 22). CPC-derived CM 
and sVCAM-1 induced phosphorylation and activation of FAK, 
Akt, ERK, and p38 MAPK in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (Figure 
6, C and E). When cardiomyocytes were pretreated with inhibi￾tors of Akt, PI3K (wortmannin), p38 MAPK (SB203580), or ERK 
(PD98059), the cardioprotective effects of CPC-derived CM and 
sVCAM-1 were significantly inhibited (Figure 6, D and F). When 
cardiomyocytes were pretreated with anti–VLA-4 Abs prior to cul￾turing in CPC-derived CM, phosphorylation of FAK, Akt, and ERK 
but not p38 MAPK was inhibited (Figure 6E). This suggests that 
the protective effects of CPC-derived CM on cardiomyocytes were 
achieved through sVCAM-1/VLA-4–mediated activation of Akt 
and ERK as well as VLA-4–independent activation of p38 MAPK.
sVCAM-1–induced migration of CPCs. Because a large number of 
transplanted CPCs migrated from the epicardial cell sheet to the 
ventricular myocardium following transplantation (Figure 4A), the 
effects of CPC-derived CM and sVCAM-1 on CPC migration were 
analyzed. When treated with CPC-derived CM or sVCAM-1, CPC 
migration was promoted, and anti–VLA-4 Abs or sVCAM-1 deple￾tion markedly inhibited CM-induced migration of CPCs (Figure 
6G). When CPCs were treated with sVCAM-1, phospho–p38 MAPK 
expression was significantly increased. However, expression of 
phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK remained unchanged. Phosphor￾ylation of p38 MAPK was significantly inhibited by anti–VLA-4 
Ab treatment (Figure 6H), which suggested that CPCs activated 
p38 MAPK through VLA-4. SB203580 inhibited CPC-derived 
CM- and sVCAM-1–induced CPC migration compared with the 
control (Figure 6I). These findings suggest that CPCs secreted 
sVCAM-1 and induced CPC migration via the VLA-4/p38 MAPK 
signaling pathway. Moreover, when VCAM-1 expression was down￾regulated, CPC viability was significantly decreased and apoptosis 
increased (Supplemental Figure 10), suggesting that VCAM-1 
might be important for CPC survival.
VLA-4 signaling plays a crucial role in the beneficial effects of CPC sheet 
transplantation. The present findings suggest that CPC-secreted 
sVCAM-1 induced angiogenesis as well as CPC migration and sur￾vival and protected cardiomyocytes via VLA-4 in vitro. Subsequent￾ly, VLA-4 signaling was analyzed to determine its role in improved

cardiac function following transplantation of CPC sheets. Because 
echocardiographic analysis revealed improved cardiac function 3 
weeks after transplantation (Figure 2A), i.p. injection of anti–VLA-4 
Abs was performed daily from 2 to 3 weeks after CPC sheet trans￾plantation. At 4 weeks after transplantation, injection of anti–VLA-4 
Abs significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of CPC sheet 
transplantation on cardiac function, fibrosis, and angiogenesis 
(Figure 7, A–D). The number of RFP+ CPCs in the infarcted area 
was also markedly decreased following treatment with anti–VLA-4 
Abs (Figure 7E). In contrast, anti–VLA-4 Ab treatment did not 
affect cardiac function, fibrotic area, or blood vessel number in 
nontransplanted MI mice (Supplemental Figure 11). These find￾ings suggest that CPC sheet transplantation improved cardiac 
function of infarcted hearts through VLA-4–mediated angiogen￾esis as well as survival and migration of transplanted CPCs.
Discussion
The present study reports that CPC sheet transplantation inhib￾ited cardiac remodeling and restored cardiac function after MI 
by increasing the number of blood vessels and cardiomyocytes in 
the injured area. sVCAM-1 was identified as one of the dominant 
paracrine factors in CPCs and was shown to induce angiogenesis, 
cardioprotection, and CPC migration and survival through the 
VLA-4 signaling pathway. Therefore, sVCAM-1 plays a critical role 
in improved cardiac function following MI.
CPC transplantation restored cardiac function and angio￾genic activity and prevented cardiac remodeling 4 weeks after 
transplantation. In contrast, ATMC transplantation attenuated 
cardiac dysfunction and enhanced angiogenesis transiently, 
and cardiac remodeling progressed at 4 weeks. These findings 
suggest varying cell survival rates (Supplemental Figure 3) and

distinct protein expression profiles (Figure 5B) in CPCs and 
ATMCs in the transplanted areas.
Through direct comparison of the protein expression profiles 
of CPCs and ATMCs, sVCAM-1 was identified as one of the pre￾dominantly expressed CPC-derived paracrine factors. VCAM-1, a 
110-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, is detected in various cells, 
including endothelial and bone marrow stromal cells (23). A soluble 
form of VCAM-1 has been reported to be shed from VCAM-1 on the 
cell surface by proteases, including TNF-α–converting enzyme (24). 
TNF-α–converting enzyme has also been reported to be elevated in 
the myocardium in heart failure (25) and to be required for fetal 
murine cardiac development and modeling (26). sVCAM-1 induces 
migration of endothelial cells through VLA-4 (21, 27, 28). The pres￾ent study demonstrates that CM from VCAM-1–knocked-down 
CPCs did not induce endothelial migration, tube formation, car￾dioprotection, or CPC migration. Anti–VLA-4 Ab treatment abol￾ished the protective effects of CPC-derived CM on cardiomyocytes 
and migration of CPCs and attenuated improved cardiac function 
following CPC sheet transplantation. This suggests that sVCAM-1 
is a major paracrine factor of cardioprotection. VLA-4 is an integrin 
dimer that is composed of CD49d (α4) and CD29 (β1). Although 
studies have shown that the β1 integrin signaling cascade regulates 
migration, differentiation, and death of various types of cells, such 
as endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and epidermal and hemato￾poietic stem cells (29–31), the role of sVCAM-1–mediated VLA-4 
signaling in stem/progenitor cells remains elusive.
CPC-derived CM and sVCAM-1 phosphorylated several integrin￾related downstream signaling molecules, such as Akt, ERK, and 
p38 MAPK, in cardiomyocytes. Consistent with previous studies, 
which indicated that Akt and ERK are critical for growth and sur￾vival of cardiomyocytes (32, 33), this study showed that promotion 
of cardiomyocyte survival by CPC-derived CM and sVCAM-1 was 
regulated through VLA-4–mediated activation of Akt and ERK. 
Furthermore, migration of CPCs, almost all of which expressed 
CD29 (β1 integrin; Supplemental Figure 1), was facilitated via the 
VLA-4/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. VCAM-1–knockout mice 
and α4 integrin–null mice have been shown to exhibit embryonic 
lethality, which was partly attributed to impaired epicardium for￾mation surrounding the ventricular and atrial chambers, which 
suggests that VCAM-1/α4 integrin signaling is critical for heart 
development (34, 35). In the present study, anti–VLA-4 Ab treat￾ment reduced survival of transplanted CPCs. Furthermore, when 
VCAM-1 of CPCs was downregulated by specific miRNA, CPC 
viability was reduced and apoptosis was increased (Supplemen￾tal Figure 10), which suggests that VCAM-1–mediated signaling 
is also important for CPC survival. Since transplanted CPCs are 
the sources of not only paracrine factors but also newly formed 
cardiomyocytes, VCAM-1–mediated paracrine effects might also 
contribute to the cardiomyogenesis of CPCs through improved 
engraftment. A recent study has suggested that adult cardiac stem 
cells express α4 and β1 integrin in the niches (36). However, the 
role of α4 and β1 integrins is not fully understood. Since adult 
mammalian cardiomyocytes have been reported to be refreshed by 
endogenous stem cells after injury (37), our results suggest that 
sVCAM-1 secreted from transplanted CPCs promoted migration 
and self renewal of not only transplanted CPCs, but also endog￾enous cardiac stem/progenitor cells, through α4 and β1 integrin.
VCAM-1 is known as an inflammatory mediator, and increased 
sVCAM-1 in plasma has been reported following acute MI (38). 
During acute-phase MI, infiltrating leukocytes release cytokines,

myocardium was observed in each group 1 week after MI/trans￾plantation, when many inflammatory cells were also observed 
(data not shown). At 4 weeks, however, VCAM-1 expression

cells in the infarcted area (Supplemental Figure 5). Furthermore, 
peripheral blood concentrations of sVCAM-1 were similar between 
groups 1 and 4 weeks after transplantation, which suggested that 
VCAM-1 expression in the transplanted heart was derived from 
CPC sheets, rather than circulating cells in the peripheral blood. 
VCAM-1 and its receptor, VLA-4, are important for fusion between 
hematopoietic progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes (39), and Oh 
et al. have reported that approximately 50% of cardiac protein–
expressing transplanted cells arise from fusion with existing car￾diomyocytes (3), which suggests that VCAM-1 mediates fusion 
between CPCs and dormant cardiomyocytes.
The present study compared transplanted cell survival between 
cell sheet transplantation and direct cell injection (Supplemental 
Figures 2 and 3). At 1 week after cell sheet transplantation, approx￾imately 40% of cells survived (Supplemental Figure 3), while only 
10% of cells survived after direct cell injection (Supplemental Fig￾ure 2). Immediately following transplantation, RFP expression in 
the heart was similar between cell sheet transplantation and direct 
cell injection, which suggested that the initial transplantation effi￾ciency was the same. These findings indicate that cell sheet trans￾plantation was superior to direct injection into the myocardium.
Many reports have demonstrated that endogenous cardiac 
stem/progenitor cells or bone marrow–derived cells mobilize 
to the infarcted area after injury and recruit additional cells 
through a feedback mechanism (40, 41). As shown in Table 2, 
CPCs expressed several chemokines, including stromal cell–
derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which recruits bone marrow–derived 
cells to the infarcted myocardium (42). Therefore, CPC sheet 
transplantation may induce migration of bone marrow–derived 
cells to the infarcted heart, thereby improving cardiac function. 
Recently, anti–α4 integrin Ab treatment was shown to improve 
cardiac function 2 weeks after MI by inhibiting interactions 
between bone marrow cells and their niches and promoting 
bone marrow cell migration and vasculogenesis (43). In the 
present study, anti–VLA-4 Ab treatment significantly attenuat￾ed improved cardiac function and angiogenesis following CPC 
sheet transplantation. Moreover, anti–VLA-4 Ab treatment did 
not affect cardiac function, fibrotic area, or blood vessel number 
in nontransplanted MI mice (Supplemental Figure 11). These 
findings suggest that bone marrow cells from their niches do 
not significantly contribute to the beneficial effects of CPC 
sheet transplantation.
There were a few limitations to the present study. The CPCs 
used in the experiments exhibited gene expression patterns simi￾lar to those of freshly isolated cardiac Sca-1–positive cells. How￾ever, profiles associated with proliferation, migration, and car￾diomyocyte differentiation may not be the same. HUVECs were 
employed in endothelial migration and tube formation assays in 
vitro, and there might be differences between HUVECs and cardi￾ac endothelial cells. Nevertheless, CPC sheet-mediated transplan￾tation might be superior to the combination of other cell sources 
and tissue engineering methods. Improved survival of transplant￾ed CPCs, in combination with several growth factors (44, 45), or 
multilayered cell sheets (46) might improve the beneficial effects 
of CPC sheet transplantation.
The present study identified the VCAM-1/VLA-4 signaling 
pathway as an important mechanism for CPC transplantation–
mediated improved cardiac function. However, other paracrine 
factors, including thymosin β4 (47), have also been reported to 
contribute to cardiac repair following MI. Therefore, multiple 
mechanisms and mutual crosstalk might be involved in cell 
sheet transplantation to improve cardiac function. It remains to 
be determined which mechanisms are the most important and 
should be improved.

ATMCs were isolated from GFP mice as previously described (48), with 
a few modifications. In brief, interscapular adipose tissues were digested at 
37°C in PBS, which contained 2.5 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen), for 45 min￾utes. After filtration through 25-μm filters and centrifugation, isolated 
ATMCs were suspended in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicil￾lin/streptomycin/amphotericin B and cultured on 1% gelatin-coated dishes. 
ATMCs from passages 3–5 were used for cell sheets.
Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated as previously described (19). 
Cardiomyocytes were plated at a field density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 on 
24-well culture dishes (BD Falcon) coated with 1% gelatin and cultured in 
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
Labeling of cells. Retroviral stocks were generated as previously described 
(19). CPCs were infected with an RFP-expressing retroviral vector. Infected 
cells were selected for growth in the presence of neomycin (500 μg/ml) for 
2 weeks. Transfection efficiency of RFP was greater than 95%.
Direct cell injection. Within 5 minutes after ligation of the left anterior 
descending artery, 2.0 × 106 RFP-labeled CPCs were directly injected into 
the infarcted regions of wild-type mice using a Hamilton syringe.

Cell sheet preparation and transplantation. CPCs or ATMCs were suspended by 
trypsinization, and the cell suspension (containing 2 ml complete medium) 
was plated onto a 35-mm temperature-responsive dish grafted with poly(N￾isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) (Upcell; CellSeed) at 1.0 × 106 cells/dish. 
The cells were cultured at 37°C. After 5 days in culture, CPCs or ATMCs 
were incubated on temperature-responsive dishes at 20°C. After 2 hours, 
CPCs and ATMCs detached spontaneously and floated in the medium as 
monolayer cell grafts. Wild-type mice were anesthetized by an i.p. injection 
of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and ventilated with a volume-regulated 
respirator. MI was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending artery 
with a 10-0 Prolene suture. Mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups: mice 
transplanted with monolayer CPCs (CPC group; n = 25); mice transplanted 
with monolayer ATMCs (ATMC group; n = 25); and mice with no transplan￾tation (MI group; n = 25). Within 5 minutes of coronary artery ligation, a 
monolayer cell sheet was placed on a plastic sheet and applied face down 
onto the surface of the infarcted anterior-lateral region. The plastic sheet was 
then carefully removed, leaving the monolayer cell sheet over the infarct area 
without sutures. Ten minutes after transplantation, the chest was closed.
For Ab treatment, anti–VLA-4 Abs (2.5 mg/kg) or anti-rat IgG2bκ Abs 
(2.5 mg/kg) as control were i.p. injected daily from 2 to 3 weeks following 
MI or CPC sheet transplantation.
Echocardiography and catheterization. Transthoracic echocardiography was 
performed with a Nemio 35 ultrasound system (Toshiba) provided with a 
12-MHz imaging transducer. For catheterization analysis, the right carotid 
artery was cannulated under anesthesia by a micropressure transducer with 
an outer diameter of 0.33 mm (SPR-1000; Millar Instruments), which was 
then advanced into the LV. Pressure signals were recorded using a Chart5 
for Windows data acquisition and analysis system (ADInstruments). Mice 
were anesthetized with 4% inhaled isoflurane, and the heart rate was main￾tained at approximately 500 bpm to minimize data deviation during car￾diac function measurement.
Flow cytometric analysis. The immunostaining methods have been previ￾ously described (4). The percentage of cells expressing each cell surface 
antigen was analyzed with an EPICS ALTRA flow cytometer using EXPO32 
software, version 1.2 (Beckman Coulter).
RNA extraction and RT-PCR. RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed as 
described previously (4). Primer sequences are shown in Supplemental Table 
1. Real-time PCR amplification was performed in a 7500 real-time PCR sys￾tem (Applied Biosystems) using GreenER Two-Step qRT-PCR Kit Universal 
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR proto￾col included an initial denaturation step (95°C, 10 minutes) followed by 50 
amplification and quantification cycles (95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 60 
seconds) and a melting curve program (60–95°C). Relative mRNA expression 
levels were calculated using the standard curve of pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP.
Western blot analysis. Whole-cell lysates (30-50 μg) were resolved by SDS￾PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) 
and incubated with primary Abs, followed by anti-IgG horseradish per￾oxidase–conjugated secondary Ab. Specific proteins were detected by 
enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).
Immunohistology. Hearts fixed in 4% PFA were embedded in paraffin, 
and 4-μm thick sections were cut and stained with Masson trichrome. 
The extent of fibrosis was measured in 3 sections from each heart, and 
the value was expressed as the ratio of Masson trichrome–stained area 
to total LV free wall. Vascularization was examined by measuring the 
number of endothelial cells in the border zone of hearts 1 and 4 weeks 
after MI under light microscopy. Endothelial cells were identified by 
immunohistochemical staining with Abs specific to vWF. Ten random 
microscopic fields in the border zone were examined, and the number of 
endothelial cells was expressed as the number of vWF-positive cells/high￾power field (original magnification, ×400).
FITC-lectin perfusion assay. At 4 weeks after MI, with or without transplan￾tation of nonlabeled CPC sheet or ATMC sheet, FITC-conjugated Lycop￾ersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin (100 μl; Vector Laboratories) diluted in 
PBS at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, was injected into the tail vein of mice 
under anesthesia. Ten minutes after injection, the animals were perfused 
with 4% PFA through the LV for 5 minutes. Hearts were removed and 
post-fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 1 hour and subsequently 
snap-frozen in nitrogen. The fluorescent images were observed by confo￾cal microscopy (LSM710; Zeiss) with LSM software, version 5.0 (Zeiss). 
Five random microscopic fields in the border zone were examined, and 
the number of vessels was expressed as the number of lectin-positive ves￾sel/high-power field (original magnification, ×600).
Immunofluorescent staining. The immunostaining methods have been 
previously described (19). Images were taken by laser confocal microscopy 
(Radiance2000; Bio-Rad) or fluorescent microscopy (Zeiss) with a CCD 
camera (Axiocam; Zeiss).
FISH analysis. Monolayer nonlabeled CPC sheets were transplanted onto 
the surface of the infarcted hearts of wild-type female mice. Four weeks 
after transplantation, mice were sacrificed, and whole hearts were snap-fro￾zen in nitrogen. Frozen sections were fixed with a mixture of methanol and 
acetic acid (3:1, v/v) for 90 minutes and subjected to FISH analysis (Cam￾bio). The sections were air-dried and dehydrated by exposure to a graded 
series of ethanol solutions. They were again air-dried and incubated in 70% 
formamide at 65°C for 120 seconds, exposed to ice-cold 70% ethanol, and 
dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions. Nucleotide probes were 
individually denatured by incubation at 65°C for 10 minutes, followed by 
37°C for 60 minutes. Two (30 μl) probes were added to each slide and 
were hybridized overnight at 37°C. For detection of X and Y chromosomes, 
FITC- or Cy3-conjugated probes were used, respectively. FITC signal of 
FITC was amplified using an FITC amplification kit (Cambio). Nuclei were 
also stained with DAPI. Sections were examined by confocal microscopy 
(LSM710; Zeiss) and LSM software.
Cytokine Ab array and ELISA. CPCs and ATMCs (1.0 × 106) were seed￾ed onto 10-cm dishes. After incubation for 12 hours in IMDM supple￾mented with 10% FBS, cells were washed with PBS thoroughly 3 times 
and medium was changed to serum-depleted IMDM. After incubation for 
24 hours in serum-depleted medium, supernatant was collected as CM 
and contaminated cells were removed using a 0.45-μm filter (BD Falcon). 
Cytokine release was measured in culture supernatant by cytokine Ab 
array or ELISA, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RayBiotech 
Inc. and R&D Systems).
miRNA vector selection and transfection. Sense and antisense oligonucleotide 
primers (Supplemental Table 2) were designed in conjunction with Invitrogen. 
These were annealed and cloned into the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vec￾tor (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All constructs 
were sequenced to confirm correct insertion of the oligonucleotides. The 
pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-neg plasmid vector served as a negative control. 
Each vector was transfected to CPCs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 
following the manufacturer’s protocol. At 8 hours after transfection, the 
medium was exchanged. After selecting the appropriate plasmid vector by 
quantitative RT-PCR on VCAM-1 mRNA expression (Supplemental Figure 
9B), that plasmid was transfected into CPCs and CM was collected.
Scratch-wound assay. In vitro “scratch” wounds were established by scrap￾ing cell monolayers. Cells were grown on 6-cm dishes, which were previous￾ly labeled with a traced line. After injury, the cells were gently washed sev￾eral times with PBS and incubated with sVCAM-1 (10 nM) or CPC-derived 
CM. Cell migration from the edge of the injured monolayer was quantified 
by measuring the distance between wound edges at time of injury and after 
24 hours incubation using an inverted phase contrast microscope (Leica) 
at 5 distinct positions.

Tube-like formation assay. A Matrigel tube formation assay was used to deter￾mine the effects of sVCAM-1 (10 nM) and CPC-derived CM on in vitro angio￾genesis potential of HUVECs. Growth-factor reduced Matrigel (250 μl; BD 
Biosciences) was added to each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to polymer￾ize at 37°C for at least 30 minutes. Trypsin-harvested HUVECs (5 × 104) were 
suspended in 250 μl endothelial basal medium with or without sVCAM-1 or 
CPC-derived CM and were seeded onto Matrigel. After incubation for 24 hours 
at 37°C, the cell 2D organization and the network growth area were examined 
using an inverted phase contrast microscope and were photographed. Tube 
length was quantified using LAS AF software, version 1.6.1 (Leica).
MTT assay. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured in 24-well 
plates and preincubated with sVCAM-1 (100 nM) or CPC-derived CM for 
24 hours in the presence or absence of anti–VLA-4 Abs (5 ng/μl), Akt inhib￾itor (10 μM), wortmannin (100 nM), SB203580 (10 μM), and PD98059 
(10 μM). H2O2 (0.2 mM) was added and incubated with the cells for an 
additional 24 hours. After aspirating the medium, cells were washed with 
PBS once and 400 μl/well PBS was added. After 2 hours incubation with 
5 mg/ml MTT solution, 10% SDS solution was added and incubated over￾night. Supernatant OD570 was measured.
Apoptosis analysis. Annexin V–Cy3 Apoptosis Detection Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) 
was used to detect apoptotic CPCs according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. In brief, 2 days after miRNA plasmid vector transfection, CPCs were 
incubated with annexin V–Cy3 (1:100) diluted in 1× binding buffer for 5 min￾utes at room temperature in the dark. The number of annexin V–positive cells 
relative to GFP-positive cells was counted under fluorescent microscopy.
Statistics. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed 
with 2-tailed Student’s t test for comparisons between 2 groups. Multiple 
group comparison was performed by 1-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s 
procedure for comparison of means. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
