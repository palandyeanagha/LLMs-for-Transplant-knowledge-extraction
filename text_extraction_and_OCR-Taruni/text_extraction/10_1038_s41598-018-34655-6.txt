Many liver transplant recipients experience intraoperative hyperglycemia after graft reperfusion. 
Accordingly, we introduced the Portland intensive insulin therapy (PoIIT) in our practice to better 
control blood glucose concentration (BGC). We evaluated the effects of PoIIT by comparing with our 
conventional insulin therapy (CoIT). Of 128 patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation 
(LDLT) during the phaseout period of CoIT, 89 were treated with the PoIIT and 39 were treated 
with CoIT. The primary outcome was hyperglycemia (BGC>180mg/dL) during the intraoperative 
postreperfusion phase. The secondary outcomes were postoperative complications such as infection. 
The incidence of hyperglycemia (22.5% vs. 53.8%, p=0.001) and prolonged hyperglycemia for >2hours 
(7.9% vs. 30.8%, p=0.002) was significantly lower in PoIIT group than in CoIT group. A mixed linear 
model further demonstrated that repeatedly measured BGCs were lower in PoIIT group (p<0.001). 
The use of PoIIT was significantly associated with decreases in major infections (OR=0.23 [0.06–0.85], 
p=0.028), prolonged mechanical ventilation (OR=0.29 [0.09–0.89], p=0.031), and biliary stricture 
(OR=0.23 [0.07–0.78], p=0.018) after adjustments for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, 
the PoIIT is effective for maintaining BGC and preventing hyperglycemia during the intraoperative 
postreperfusion phase of living donor liver transplantation with potential clinical benefits.
Liver transplantation is attended with various metabolic disturbances1
. Rapid increase in blood glucose concen￾tration (BGC) after graft reperfusion is one of them and results from the systemic influx of glucose from hepat￾ocytes destroyed by ischemia reperfusion injury2,3
. Intraoperative hyperglycemia during liver transplantation is 
associated with surgical site infection, overall infectious complications, and mortality4–6
. The decrease in immu￾nity7,8
 and increase in ischemia reperfusion injury9
 resulting from acute hyperglycemic disturbance are thought 
to be the underlying mechanisms for these adverse outcomes. Moreover, the early postreperfusion period is a 
critical time during which substantial hepatic insult occurs and graft regeneration is initiated concurrent with 
metabolic, synthetic, and detoxifying burdens10–12. Accordingly, liver transplant anesthesiologists strive to main￾tain glycemic homeostasis during the intraoperative postreperfusion phase to improve post-transplant clinical 
courses. However, hyperglycemia is still not rare because the extent of hepatocyte ischemia reperfusion injury is 
profound and insulin sensitivity is impaired due to underlying chronic liver disease, surgical stress, vasoactive 
drugs, and steroid immunosuppression. The optimal postreperfusion glycemic strategies to improve liver trans￾plant outcomes remain unresolved6
.
As a well-established form of intensive insulin therapy (IIT), the Portland IIT (PoIIT) protocol was designed 
for patients treated in surgical cardiac intensive care units (ICU) and validated as a reliable glycemic strategy with 
clinical benefits13,14. The success of the PoIIT is attributable to a dynamic algorithm modifying therapeutic insulin

doses by accounting for patient insulin sensitivity that is evaluated according to the rate of BGC change at a set 
insulin dose. That is, calculated insulin dose differs according to the rate of BGC change even if the measured 
BGCs are the same15. Thus, we had deduced that the PoIIT effectively controls rapid intraoperative hyperglycemic 
changes in liver transplant recipients and introduced the PoIIT to our practice in January 2015. Among various 
algorithms with different target BGC ranges, we chose the PoIIT with the lowest target range (80–120mg/dL) to 
rapidly control hyperglycemia and minimize the duration of intraoperative hyperglycemia16. We also considered 
that the risk of hypoglycemia is low due to frequent intraoperative BGC checkups17. Herein, we evaluated the 
effects of the PoIIT by comparing results with those of our conventional insulin therapy (CoIT) in recipients who 
underwent liver transplantation during the phaseout period of CoIT.
Materials and Methods
Subjects and data collection. We reviewed the medical records of 128 patients who underwent their first 
adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantations at our institution during the phaseout period of CoIT (implan￾tation period of the PoIIT) between January 2015 and July 2017. Of these, 39 recipients were treated with CoIT 
and 89 recipients were treated with the PoIIT. During the phaseout period, the PoIIT was gradually established 
as a standard protocol by ensuring patient safety and compliance with attending anesthetists (Supplementary 
Table S1). All data were collected from computerized medical records or a liver transplant database (prospectively 
collected) and were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. The Institutional Review Board of Samsung 
Medical Center approved this retrospective study (SMC 2016-11-016) and waived the requirement for written 
informed consent. All procedures in this study were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and 
regulations. No grafts were procured from prisoners. All surgeries were performed at our hospital by surgeons in 
the Department of surgery, Samsung Medical Center.
Perioperative glycemic management. Recipients fasted starting the evening before surgery and 5% 
dextrose solution was infused at a rate of 80 mL/h during the fasting period. Preoperative oral carbohydrate 
supplements were not provided. During surgery, arterial BGCs were measured in combination with other arterial 
blood-derived parameters using a blood gas/chemistry analysis device (RAPIDLAB1265, Siemens Healthcare 
Diagnostics Inc., Berlin, Germany) on an hourly basis, as well as at the following additional time points: start 
of the anhepatic phase, immediately before graft reperfusion, and 5 and 30 minutes after graft reperfusion, as 
described previously11. The blood gas/chemistry analysis device was near each patient and clinicians were able to 
reach the device within 1minute after arterial blood sampling. Insulin therapy was not indicated for controlling 
BGC before graft reperfusion because BGC generally decreases during the anhepatic phase due to the lack of 
hepatic glucose production18. Instead, hyperkalemia was corrected using the conventional large-bolus insulin 
method (10 units of regular insulin) if the blood potassium concentration was >4.5 mEq/L19. After graft reperfu￾sion, the PoIIT or CoIT was initiated at the discretion of anesthetists until ICU arrival. For CoIT, the continuous 
insulin infusion dose was determined solely by the current BGC: insulin (Humulin R, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, 
USA) was infused at 5 U/h if BGC>150mg/dL or at 10 U/h if BGC>200mg/dL. For PoIIT, both bolus injection 
and continuous infusion doses were determined by accounting for the degree of BGC change between the current 
and previous checkups and previous insulin dose in addition to the current BGC (Supplementary Fig. S1)16. After 
ICU arrival, glycemic management was performed by liver transplant surgeons based on a standardized proto￾col that is independent from intraoperative glycemic protocols. BGCs were measured at ICU arrival and every 
8 hours thereafter using a blood gas/chemistry analysis device (RAPIDLAB1265). Insulin dose was increased 
by 2 U/h if BGC was 180–240mg/dL and by 3 U/h if BGC was 240–300mg/dL; in contrast, the insulin dose was 
decreased by 1 U/h if BGC was 100–140mg/dL. Insulin therapy was stopped if BGC was <100mg/dL.
Anesthetic management. Anesthesia was performed based on a standardized institutional protocol as 
described previously11. In short, mechanical ventilation was delivered at a tidal volume of 8mL per ideal body 
weight (kg) using a mixture of medical air and oxygen with positive end-expiratory pressure set at 6mmHg. The 
respiratory rate was adjusted as needed to maintain normocapnea. Vasoactive drugs were used to maintain mean 
arterial pressure >70mmHg. Metabolic acidosis was corrected with sodium bicarbonate when the base deficit was 
>10 mEq/L. Body core temperature was maintained using a whole body-sized warm blanket, airway humidifi￾ers, and fluid warming devices. Transfusion of allogeneic blood was strictly controlled based on a restrictive and 
prophylactic policy, with each blood component transfused separately according to its respective indication. Blood 
salvage was routinely used for intraoperative autotransfusion irrespective of the presence of a hepatic tumor20.
Perioperative surgical procedures. Acceptance criteria for liver donation were age ≤65 years, body mass 
index <35 kg/m2
, macrosteatosis ≤30%, and residual liver volume ≥30%. Individuals with any type of hepatitis 
or fibrosis were excluded from donation. All grafts consisted of segments 5–8 excluding the middle hepatic vein 
trunk. Graft implantation was performed using the piggyback technique. After the portal vein anastomosis was 
completed, the graft was reperfused by consecutively unclamping the hepatic vein and portal vein. The hepatic 
artery was subsequently anastomosed, followed by biliary anastomosis. Immunosuppression was performed 
based on a quadruple regimen consisting of methylprednisolone, basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, and tac￾rolimus as described previously21. In particularly, recipients received methylprednisolone 500mg intravenously 
before graft reperfusion for the induction of immunosuppression and 500 mg daily until postoperative day 2, 
followed by a tapered dose of 60mg per day for 5 days, and then 8mg twice per day for 1 month.
Variables and statistical analysis. The primary outcome was hyperglycemia during the intraoperative 
postreperfusion phase. Hyperglycemia was defined when a BGC was >180mg/dL based on previous research22. 
Secondary outcomes were blood potassium, the extent of hepatocyte injury, and postoperative complications. 
Hepatocyte injury was determined by monitoring aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase

(ALT) during the first week after surgery23. Postoperative complications were graded according to the modified 
Clavien-Dindo classification24,25. Surgical site infections included superficial/deep incisional infections or organ/
space infections according to the Centers for Disease Control definitions for surgical infection26. Major infections 
included septicemia, peritonitis, pneumonia, and tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus disease. During the postopera￾tive period, the first BGC or potassium concentration measured each day was used for analysis. Continuous vari￾ables are expressed as mean±standard deviation or median (25th percentile–75th percentile) and were analyzed 
by t-test or the Mann-Whitney test. Repeatedly measured continuous variables were analyzed by a mixed linear 
model with the Bonferroni correction. Categorical variables are expressed as frequency (%) and were analyzed by 
chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, or binary logistic regression, as appropriate. In terms of postoperative complica￾tions, potential compounding effect from age, sex, and diabetes mellitus was adjusted during multivariable analysis 
and the risk of type I error or the false discovery rate was controlled by using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure27. 
All reported p values were 2-sided, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed 
using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) or SAS version 9.2 (SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Clinical characteristics. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, there were no significant differences between CoIT 
group and PoIIT group regarding graft quantity/quality, recipient baseline clinical characteristics, or intraop￾erative hemodynamic variables (p>0.05). Preoperative fasting BGC was 118±50 mg/dL in CoIT group and 
107±32mg/dL in PoIIT group (p=0.215). Mean duration of the intraoperative postreperfusion phase was about 
4 hours for each group and the amount of insulin infused during the postreperfusion phase was significantly 
greater in the PoIIT group than in the CoIT group (24±16 U vs. 18±12 U, p=0.006). No recipients experienced 
hypoglycemia of BGC<60mg/dL15,28: only one PoIIT recipient reached <70mg/dL (65mg/dL).
Intraoperative BGCs after graft reperfusion. BGC at the moment of graft reperfusion was comparable 
between the two groups: 117±35mg/dL in CoIT group and 120±28mg/dL in PoIIT group (p=0.631). As shown 
in Fig. 1a, BGCs continued to increase after graft reperfusion in CoIT group, whereas BGCs gradually decreased in 
PoIIT group. BGCs at 1, 2, 3, and 4hours after graft reperfusion, and at the moment of ICU arrival, were 155±38, 
154±31, 159±28, 160±28, and 167±37mg/dL, respectively, in CoIT group and 149±27 (p>0.99), 137±22 
(p=0.015), 134±17 (p<0.001), 134±17 (p<0.001), and 137±23 mg/dL (p<0.001), respectively, in PoIIT 
group. Repeatedly measured BGCs were significantly lower in PoIIT group than in CoIT group (p<0.001). As 
shown in Fig. 2, the incidence of hyperglycemia was significantly lower in PoIIT group than in CoIT group (22.5% 
vs. 53.8%, p=0.001) as well as prolonged hyperglycemia occurring during >2hours (7.9% vs. 30.8%, p=0.002). 
At 3hours after graft reperfusion, no patients in PoIIT group and 9 recipients (23.1%) in CoIT group had hyper￾glycemia (p<0.001). Within the subgroup of recipients with diabetes (18 with the PoIIT and 11 with CoIT), 
BGCs continued to increase after graft reperfusion in CoIT group, whereas BGCs gradually decreased in PoIIT

group, as shown in the whole cohort (Fig. 1b). Repeatedly measured BGCs were significantly lower in PoIIT group 
(p<0.001). The incidence of hyperglycemia (33.3% vs. 63.6%, p=0.143) and prolonged hyperglycemia (11.1% vs. 
36.4%, p=0.164) were insignificantly lower in PoIIT group, most likely due to insufficient sample size29.
Intraoperative blood potassium concentrations after graft reperfusion. Blood potassium con￾centrations gradually decreased in PoIIT group after graft reperfusion, whereas it continued to increase in CoIT 
group (Fig. 3). Repeatedly measured potassium concentrations were significantly lower in PoIIT group than in 
CoIT group (p<0.001). One CoIT recipient (2.6%) and one PoIIT recipient (1.1%) experienced hyperkalemia 
(>5.5 mEq/L) during the intraoperative postreperfusion phase (p=0.518), and were managed with an additional 
bolus insulin injection. Four CoIT recipients (10.3%) and 6 PoIIT recipients (6.7%) experienced hypokalemia 
(<3.0 mEq/L, p=0.492), and were managed with intravenous potassium replacement (5 mEq/h) without any 
detected complications. No patients reached <2.5 mEq/L.
Postoperative blood glucose and potassium concentrations. There were no significant differences 
between the two groups regarding blood glucose and potassium concentrations after the cessation of intraoper￾ative glycemic protocols and the start of the ICU glycemic protocol (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating that a 
single ICU glycemic protocol was performed similarly for the two groups.

Postoperative complications. As shown in Fig. 4a, repeatedly measured postoperative ASTs were signif￾icantly lower in PoIIT group than in CoIT group p=0.015, indicating less hepatocyte injury in relation to the 
use of the PoIIT. In particular, AST level immediately after ICU arrival was 257±159 IU/L in PoIIT group and 
390±333 IU/L in CoIT group. Repeatedly measured ALTs were insignificantly lower in PoIIT group (p=0.412) 
(Fig. 4b). In particular, ALT level immediately after ICU arrival was 213±167 IU/L in PoIIT group and 340±347 
IU/L in CoIT group. As shown in Table 3, results of univariable analysis indicated that the risks of major infection 
(4.5% vs. 17.9%, OR=0.22 [0.06–0.79], p=0.020), prolonged mechanical ventilation (6.7% vs. 20.5%, OR=0.28 
[0.09–0.87], p=0.028), and biliary stricture (5.6% vs. 20.5%, OR=0.23 [0.07–0.76], p=0.016) were significantly 
lower in PoIIT group. After adjustments for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus, the PoIIT was significantly associ￾ated with decreases in major infections (OR=0.23 [0.06–0.85], p=0.028), prolonged mechanical ventilation 
(OR=0.29 [0.09–0.89], p=0.031), and biliary stricture (OR=0.23 [0.07–0.78], p=0.018). Detailed results of 
multivariable analysis for each outcome variable are described in Supplementary Table S2.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that the PoIIT was superior to our CoIT for controlling acute hyperglycemic 
disturbance after graft reperfusion and for preventing intraoperative hyperglycemia during the postreperfu￾sion phase in living donor liver transplantations. Hyperglycemia risk was reduced by 60% in relation to the use 
of the PoIIT (22.5% vs. 53.8%). Although greater amounts of insulin were used with the PoIIT, no recipients 
developed clinically relevant hypoglycemia. PoIIT showed an additional advantage by preventing increases in 
potassium concentration after graft reperfusion. Moreover, the use of the PoIIT was associated with improved 
post-transplant clinical courses in terms of hepatocyte injury, major infection, prolonged mechanical ventilation, 
and biliary stricture.
Among the various IITs16, our team selected the PoIIT because it was designed for surgical patients, while 
many IITs are for medical ICU patients, and because the PoIIT has been well-validated as an effective intraoper￾ative glycemic protocol in cardiac surgeries during which glycemic environment and patient insulin sensitivity

change considerably during surgery13,14. Moreover, a previous study has suggested that hypoglycemia risk is lower 
in the PoIIT than in other IITs, particularly when insulin sensitivity is impaired16. Nonetheless, it was unclear 
whether the PoIIT would be effective for use in liver transplantation. Some studies of patients undergoing liver 
surgeries have highlighted the necessity of developing better intraoperative glycemic strategies by reporting the 
difficulties in controlling BGC and negative clinical impacts of intraoperative hyperglycemia4,5,30. In a previous 
study comparing 60 liver transplant recipients with mean intraoperative BGC of <150mg/dL and 124 recipients 
with mean intraoperative BGC of ≥150mg/dL, higher intraoperative BGC was associated with post-transplant 
infections and mortality5
. Another study of 680 recipients demonstrated that intraoperative hyperglycemia 
(BGC>200mg/dL) was associated with surgical site infection4
. Despite the need for better intraoperative glyce￾mic protocols for liver transplantation, there have been no studies evaluating the efficacy and/or safety of particu￾lar insulin infusion protocols.
The mechanisms underlying the association of the use of PoIIT with improved post-transplant clinical out￾comes might be attributable to decreased intraoperative BGCs and hyperglycemia. First, acute transient hypergly￾cemia or BGC fluctuation even during short periods disturbs the innate immune system by inhibiting neutrophil 
migration, phagocytosis, and complement function, stimulating inflammatory cytokines, and decreasing micro￾vascular reactivity7,8
. The deterioration of innate immune response may promote infection progress. Second, 
previous research demonstrated that only a transient period of acute hyperglycemia is necessary to aggravate 
ischemia reperfusion injury via oxidative stress and impaired tissue microcirculation3,9
. A previous study of crit￾ically ill patients demonstrated that hepatocyte mitochondrial ultrastructure and function can be protected by 
preventing acute hyperglycemia with tight glycemic control31. Moreover, insulin may directly mitigate hepato￾cyte injury by serving as a scavenger of free radicals generated during the ischemia reperfusion process32. Third, 
decreased hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury could also benefit the bile duct23. Ischemia reperfusion injury 
to the microvasculature of the bile duct arteriolar plexus causes biliary epithelial cell damage; consequently, 
inflammatory cells penetrate between epithelial cells and basement membranes, and result in biliary stricture33, 
Moreover, insulin is an essential molecule for the regeneration of hepatic tissues including the bile duct34,35. A 
previous study in rats demonstrated that the degree of liver regeneration after hepatectomy was lower in subjects 
with decreased insulin sensitivity and suggested the benefit of insulin administration36. Another study demon￾strated that early graft regeneration after LDLT was improved in relation to postoperative insulin administra￾tion37. Fourth, acute hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress is systemic and can affect various tissues and organs 
in remote areas including the diaphragm38, which supports the association between the use of the PoIIT and 
decreased risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation. In addition, a direct anabolic effect of insulin on respiratory 
muscles may play a role: previous research demonstrated that insulin administration promotes skeletal muscle 
protein uptake and synthesis, improving skeletal muscle function39.
This study had several limitations. First, due to its retrospective nature, we are unable to establish a direct 
cause-and-effect relationship between the use of the PoIIT and improved post-transplant outcomes, although 
some of the underlying mechanisms can be hypothesized based on previous studies. In addition, we were unable 
to include more variables in the multivariable model due to the limited event number40. Thus, the association 
between strict glycemic management and post-transplant outcomes warrants further research with sufficient 
sample size. Nonetheless, we performed the Bonferroni correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to

decrease the risk of type I error. Moreover, the sufficient sample size to assess the primary outcome was an advan￾tage of the current study: the power of the 50% reduction of an assumed intraoperative hyperglycemia rate with 
the PoIIT was 83%. Second, there was a potential risk of selection bias because the use of the PoIIT or CoIT 
was determined at the discretion of attending anesthetists. In this regard, we tested and confirmed the absence 
of significant differences among 4 attending anesthetists who covered all recipients evaluated in the current

study regarding graft quantity and quality, donor factors, recipient factors, and preoperative laboratory findings 
(Supplementary Table S3). Third, only 25.8% of recipients with the PoIIT reached the target range (80–120mg/
dL) before ICU arrival, during about 4hours after the initiation of the PoIIT, most likely due to profound hepatic 
injury and severe insulin insensitivity. Thus, it remains unclear that how fast the target BGC range can be achieved 
and how safely the target range can be maintained once it is achieved. It should be noted that IIT-induced severe 
hypoglycemia and hypokalemia can cause poor outcomes17,41. In addition, identifying the optimal time window 
for the use of the PoIIT warrants further research. Nonetheless, the results of the current study suggest that tran￾sient use of PoIIT during the intraoperative postreperfusion phase and prevention of acute hyperglycemia for the 
critical time window may provide clinical benefits.
The use of the PoIIT during the intraoperative postreperfusion phase was associated with decreases in intra￾operative hyperglycemia and postoperative complications such as infections, prolonged mechanical ventilation, 
and biliary stricture. We observed no increases in the risks of hypoglycemia or hypokalemia in relation to the use 
of the PoIIT. Our findings suggest that the PoIIT effectively and safely controls acute hyperglycemic change after 
graft reperfusion and prevents hyperglycemia during LDLT, resulting in potential clinical benefits.
