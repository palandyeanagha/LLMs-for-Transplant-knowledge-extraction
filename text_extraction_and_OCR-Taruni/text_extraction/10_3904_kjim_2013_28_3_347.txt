Background/Aims: We investigated the incidence and clinical characteristics of 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the native kidney of renal transplant recipients.
Methods: Between 1991 and 2010, 1,425 patients underwent kidney transplanta￾tion at our institution. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical features and 
outcomes in renal transplant patients with RCC in the native kidney after renal 
transplantation.
Results: The patients included three males and two females with a mean age of 
63 years (range, 52 to 74). The incidence of RCC was 0.35%. The median interval 
between renal transplantation and RCC occurrence was 16.2 years (range, 9 to 20). 
All of our patients with RCC had developed renal cysts either before (n = 3) or after 
(n = 2) renal transplantation. The mean duration of dialysis was 12 months (range, 
2 to 39). Of the five patients, four underwent dialysis treatment for less than 8 
months. All the RCCs were low grade at the time of diagnosis. Four patients un￾derwent radical nephrectomy, and one patient refused the operation. The four 
patients who underwent radical nephrectomy showed no evidence of local recur￾rence or distant metastasis during the median follow-up of 2.9 years. However, 
the patient who did not undergo surgery developed spinal metastasis from the 
RCC 6 years later.
Conclusions: This study suggests that the follow-up period is an important fac￾tor for the development of RCC in renal transplant recipients, and more vigorous 
screening with a longer follow-up period is required in renal transplant recipi￾ents.

INTRODUCTION
With longer graft survival in transplant recipients and 
the introduction of more potent immunosuppressive 
medications, malignancies contribute to mortality in 
9% to 16% of renal transplant recipients [1]. The overall 
incidence of malignancy after renal transplantation 
is three to five times higher than that in the general 
population [2,3], and urinary tract cancer is reported as 
the third most common malignancy after renal trans￾plantation [4].
The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is re￾ported to be 15 times higher in the native kidney of pa￾tients after renal transplantation than in the general

population [5]. Renal cysts and long dialysis duration 
are risk factors for RCC in renal transplant recipients 
[6]. The probability of RCC among patients with ac￾quired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is 4% to 7% over a 
7- to 10-year period [7,8], with an annual incidence of 
0.18% [9]. Whereas most RCCs are low-grade tumors 
with favorable prognoses [10], the prognosis of meta￾static RCC is very poor [11].
In this study, we investigated the incidence and 
clinical characteristics of RCC in the native kidney of 
renal transplant recipients at a single healthcare cen￾ter.
METHODS
Between 1991 and 2010, 1,425 patients underwent kid￾ney transplantation at our institution. Of these, five 
(0.35%) developed malignancy in the native kidneys. 
We retrospectively evaluated the clinical features and 
outcomes of the native kidneys in these five patients 
with RCC in the native kidney after they underwent 
renal transplantation. This study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Seoul St. Mary’s Hospi￾tal.
We investigated the incidence of RCC in the native 
kidneys of renal transplant recipients, the duration of 
dialysis before transplantation, the time period from 
the onset of RCC to the time of transplantation, the 
use of immunosuppressives, and the prognosis. Radi￾cal nephrectomy was performed when computed to￾mography confirmed the presence of an irregular cyst 
wall or a solid tumor. The presence of a renal cyst, the 
size, stage and Fuhrman grade of the surgical speci￾mens were recorded.
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of the patients with RCC 
are presented in Table 1. The patients included three 
males and two females with a mean age of 63 years 
(range, 52 to 74). The mean follow-up period after renal 
transplantation was 16.2 years (range, 9 to 20). The pa￾tients had developed renal cysts before (n = 3) or after 
(n = 2) renal transplantation. The mean duration of

dialysis was 12 months (range, 2 to 39), and all patients 
except one underwent dialysis treatment for less than 
8 months. Four patients who underwent dialysis for 
less than 8 months received living donor allografts. 
Four patients were asymptomatic, and one complained 
of vague abdominal discomfort. The asymptomatic 
patients were diagnosed using routine ultrasonogra￾phy. All patients received standard immunosuppres￾sive treatment at the time of RCC diagnosis. Of the five 
patients, three received dual therapy with cyclosporine 
and prednisolone, and two patients received triple 
therapy with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and pred￾nisolone.
After RCC diagnosis, four patients underwent radi￾cal nephrectomy, and one patient refused the opera￾tion. The four patients who underwent the surgery 
showed no evidence of local recurrence or distant me￾tastasis during the follow-up period (median follow-up 
duration, 2.9 years). The patient with RCC who did not 
undergo surgery developed spinal metastasis 6 years 
later; he died despite undergoing radical nephrec￾tomy at that time. Analysis of the surgical specimens 
showed that the mean tumor size was 3.2 cm (range, 0.5 
to 5.1) and that all the RCCs were low grade at the time 
of diagnosis. Two patients had clear cell carcinoma; 
two patients had papillary RCC; and one patient had 
multilocular cystic RCC. The tumors were graded ac￾cording to the Fuhrman grading system: two tumors 
were grade I, one was grade II, one was grade III, and 
one was grade IV.
DISCUSSION
In a follow-up period of an average of 16.2 years, the 
cumulative incidence of RCC after transplant in five 
renal transplant recipients with was 0.35%, which 
translates to 20 RCCs in 100,000 renal transplant re￾cipient years. According to data from the Korean Cen￾tral Cancer Registry in 2007, the incidence of RCC in 
the general population was 5.8 of 100,000 persons [12]. 
Thus, the incidence of RCC in this study was 3.4-time 
that in the general population, which was relatively 
low considering that RCC has been reported to be 
approximately 15 times more common in renal trans￾plant recipients than in the general population of the 
United States [5]. Stafford et al. [13] reported that such 
racial disparity in RCC incidence might be due to bio￾logical, behavioral, and environmental factors.
Renal cysts and ACKD are major risk factors for 
RCC in renal transplant recipients [6,14]. Nephron loss 
associated with renal insufficiency may promote hy￾perplasia of tubular epithelial cells, resulting in cyst 
formation, and atypical epithelial proliferation in the 
cyst may represent a precursor lesion to RCC [15]. In 
this study, all patients had renal cysts at the time they 
were diagnosed with RCC. Three of the five patients 
developed renal cysts before renal transplantation 
and the remaining two patients developed renal cysts 
after transplantation. Ishikawa et al. [16] suggested 
that renal cyst formation may cease or regress follow￾ing renal transplantation with removal of the uremic 
milieu. However, in our study, two patients (40%) de￾veloped renal cysts after renal transplantation; this 
result is similar to previous reports that renal cyst 
development is not arrested after transplantation [6,14]. 
Therefore, it is important to screen the native kidney 
in renal transplant recipients after renal transplanta￾tion, regardless of the presence of a renal cyst.
Long duration of dialysis is associated with ACKD 
and is reported as a risk factor for RCC in renal trans￾plant recipients [6,14,17]. In a recent study, dialysis 
treatment for more than 4.6 years was found to be as￾sociated with RCC in renal transplant recipients [14]. 
However, in our study, the mean duration of dialysis 
was 12 months (range, 2 to 39), and four patients under￾went dialysis treatment for less than 8 months. These 
four patients received living donor allografts within 
8 months of dialysis initiation. This transplantation 
explains the shorter duration of dialysis treatment in 
our cases compared to those in previous studies. Thus, 
it is necessary to consider the possibility of RCC in the 
native kidney of patients with dialysis treatment of 
short duration.
The median interval between renal transplantation 
and RCC occurrence was 16.2 years (range, 9 to 20), 
which is relatively long considering that the inter￾val ranged from 4.5 to 10.5 years in previous reports 
[6,10,11,17]. A greater number of cancers may develop 
and be detected if patients are followed up for longer 
time. Hwang et al. [18] reported that a longer follow￾up period after kidney transplantation is associated

with cancer in renal transplant recipients. Thus, vig￾orous cancer screening is required in renal transplant 
recipients with longer follow-up periods. For early 
RCC detection, Goh and Vathsala [6] recommended 
that regular ultrasonography be performed within 1 
month of transplantation, every 5 years thereafter for 
those without cysts, and every 2 years thereafter for 
those with cysts. However, no guidelines exist for RCC 
screening in recipients after renal transplantation.
In general, it has been reported that the prognosis of 
low stage RCC in the native kidney of renal transplant 
recipients is favorable [10]. In contrast, the prognosis of 
metastatic RCC is very poor [11]. All RCCs in our study 
were low grade at the time of diagnosis. After RCC 
detection, radical nephrectomy was performed in four 
of five patients; one patient refused to undergo the 
operation. The four patients who underwent radical 
nephrectomy showed no evidence of local recurrence 
or distant metastasis during the median follow-up of 
2.9 years. However, the patient who refused to undergo 
the operation presented with spinal metastasis of 
RCC 6 years later and died despite undergoing radical 
nephrectomy. Therefore, nephrectomy should be per￾formed immediately when RCC is diagnosed in renal 
transplant recipients.
 In summary, the incidence of RCC was 0.35% in this 
study. Renal cysts, a major risk factor for RCC in renal 
transplant recipients, were detected in all subjects. The 
mean follow-up period in this study was 16.2 years, 
which was longer than reported previously. Our find￾ings suggest that the follow-up period is an important 
factor for development of RCC in renal transplant 
recipients, and more vigorous cancer screening with a 
longer follow-up period is needed in renal transplant 
recipients.
