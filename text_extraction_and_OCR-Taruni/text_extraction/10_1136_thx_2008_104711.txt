Abstract


Rationale: Lower airway (LAW) infection with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of
morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF). The upper airways (UAW) were
shown to be a gateway for acquisition of opportunistic bacteria and
to act as a reservoir for them. Therefore, tools for UAW assessment
within CF routine care require evaluation.
Objectives: The aims of the study were non-invasive assessment of
UAW and LAW microbial colonisation, and genotyping of P
aeruginosa and S aureus strains from both segments.
Methods: 182 patients with CF were evaluated (age 0.4–68 years,
median 17 years). LAW specimens were preferably sampled as
expectorated sputum and UAW specimens by nasal lavage. P
aeruginosa and S aureus isolates were typed by informative single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or by spa typing, respectively.
Results: Of the typable S aureus and P aeruginosa isolates from
concomitant UAW- and LAW-positive specimens, 31 of 36 patients
were carrying identical S aureus spa types and 23 of 24 patients
identical P aeruginosa SNP genotypes in both compartments.
Detection of S aureus or P aeruginosa in LAW specimens was
associated with a 15- or 88-fold higher likelihood also to identify S
aureus or P aeruginosa in a UAW specimen from the same patient.
Conclusions: The presence of identical genotypes in UAW and LAW
suggests that the UAW play a role as a reservoir of S aureus and P
aeruginosa in CF. Nasal lavage appears to be suitable for non-
invasive UAW sampling, but further longitudinal analyses and
comparison with invasive methods are required. While UAW
bacterial colonisation is typically not assessed in regular CF care,
the data challenge the need to discuss diagnostic and therapeutic
standards for this airway compartment.
Trial registration number: NCT00266474.
