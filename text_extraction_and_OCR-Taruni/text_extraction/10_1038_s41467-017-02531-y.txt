Epigenomic abnormalities caused by genetic mutation in epigenetic regulators can result in
neurodevelopmental disorders, deficiency in neural plasticity and mental retardation. As a
histone demethylase, plant homeodomain finger protein 8 (Phf8) is a candidate gene for
syndromal and non-specific forms of X-chromosome-linked intellectual disability (XLID).
Here we report that Phf8 knockout mice displayed impaired learning and memory, and
impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) without gross morphological defects. We
also show that mTOR signaling pathway is hyperactive in hippocampus in Phf8 knockout
mouse. Mechanistically, we show that demethylation of H4K20me1 by Phf8 results in tran￾scriptional suppression of RSK1 and homeostasis of mTOR signaling. Pharmacological sup￾pression of mTOR signaling with rapamycin in Phf8 knockout mice recovers the weakened
LTP and cognitive deficits. Together, our results indicate that loss of Phf8 in animals causes
deficient learning and memory by epigenetic disruption of mTOR signaling, and provides a
potential therapeutic drug target to treat XLID.

ntellectual disability is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental
disorder characterized by impaired intellectual and adaptive
functioning1. Genetic deficiency in X chromosome has been
identified as one of the most important causes of intellectual
disability, based on the clinical observation that mental retarda￾tion occurs more often in males than in females2. Large-scale
genetic analysis and functional studies have revealed the causal
relationship between genetic mutations, deletions or duplications
in X chromosome and X-linked intellectual disability (XLID)2–7.
For example, mutation of FMR1 gene at Xq27 leads to dendritic
spine abnormalities, impaired synaptic plasticity and severe
mental retardation8,9.
Systematic mutation screening of brain-expressed genes and
linkage analysis of familial mental retardation have identified
plant homeodomain finger protein 8 (Phf8, located in Xp11.2) as
one of XLID-associated genes10–12. PHF8 contains two functional
domains, an amino-terminal PHD finger recognizing lysine￾methylated histones and a JmjC domain catalyzing lysine
demethylation. Previous in vitro demethyaltion assays have
shown that PHF8 can demethylate histone H3K9me2/me1,
H4K20me1, and/or H3K27me213–16. Genetic silencing of Phf8 in
cultured cells leads to a delay in G1–S transition during cell cycle
progression and impaired neuronal differentiation14,17. In vivo
functional studies have revealed that loss of PHF8 causes apop￾tosis of neural cells in zebrafish and compromised locomotion in
nematode, respectively13,15. Together, these studies provide evi￾dence for the potential role of PHF8 in regulating cell differ￾entiation and survival. However, the role of PHF8 in neural and
cognitive function within mammalian brains remains unknown.
Homeostatic protein translation in neurons is critical for
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.
Ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) controls protein translation by pro￾moting signaling cascade of mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase regulating translation rate and
long-lasting synaptic plasticity18,19. Hyperactive mTOR signaling

recently been reported in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis,
Fragile X and Down’s syndrome, all of which display intellectual
disability20,21.
Here, we show that Phf8 knockout mice display impaired long￾term potentiation (LTP) and deficiency in learning and memory.
The epigenetic disruption of RSK-mTOR-S6K signaling is
involved in cognitive defects by loss of Phf8 and that the FDA￾approved mTOR inhibitor rapamycin can rescue the behavioral
and LTP deficits caused by Phf8 deletion.
Results
Generation of Phf8 null mice. The lack of animal model with
mutant Phf8 impedes the progress in uncovering the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying XLID. To model mental
retardation in humans with PHF8 deficiency, we generated Phf8
knockout (KO) mice by targeting the exons 7 and 8 encoding the
core region of mice PHF8. The strategy of generating KO allele
was described in detail in previous work22. Genotyping results
showed recombinase-mediated efficient deletion of exons 7 and 8
in the genome of mutant mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The
genetic disruption of Phf8 was validated at protein level by
immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We further confirmed
the loss of Phf8 in cortical and hippocampal neurons by immu￾nostaining on Phf8-deficient brains (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
Phf8 null mice show learning and memory impairment. To
address whether Phf8 knockout mice mimic the intellectual dis￾ability in patients, we evaluated the learning and memory capa￾city of mice. Morris water maze was used to determine their
spatial learning and memory. In the test, the control wild-type
(WT) mice learned to use spatial cues to navigate a direct path to
the hidden platform and displayed a significant preference for
target quadrant at 3 (probe test 1), 5 (test 2), and 7 (test 3) days
after training (Fig. 1a). However, the mutant mice exhibited
significantly increased escape latency during the training process
(Fig. 1b). In probe trials, we performed to assess spatial memory,
the preference for target quadrant was strikingly compromised in
KO mice as compared with WT mice (Fig. 1a). The observation
that the swimming speed during training and the escape latency
in water maze test with visible platform were comparable between
control and mutant mice rules out the effect of motor and per￾ceptual abilities on the spatial learning and memory (Fig. 1c, d).
We also evaluated whether PHF8 is essential for consolidation
of fear memory with contextual fear conditioning test, and found
that the freezing time of mutant mice receiving foot shock 1 day
before test was shorter than that of control mice (Fig. 1e).
However, additional behavioral tests showed that Phf8 mutant
mice did not display any motor disability but, instead, a slight
increase in spontaneous activity (Fig. 1f, g). Taken together, these
results suggest that learning and memory are impaired in Phf8
null mice.
The knockout mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio,
and have similar weight and size to their wild-type littermates at
both neonatal and adult stages (Supplementary Fig. 2a and b and
Supplementary Fig. 3a and b). Although a subpopulation of XLID
patients with PHF8 mutations display cleft lip and palate, we did
not observe any deficits in craniofacial and limb development
(Supplementary Fig. 3c and d). These results suggest that Phf8 is
dispensable for gross development of mice.
Phf8 null mice show LTP deficit. As the most well-characterized
form of synaptic plasticity, activity-dependent long-term poten￾tiation (LTP) in the hippocampus has long been considered as a
cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory23–25. We
next focused on hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and
memory by investigating the activity-dependent LTP in the hip￾pocampus, and field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) at
Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse was measured in acute hippo￾campal slices from control and Phf8 null mice. As expected, we
found that tetanic stimulation-induced LTP was compromised in
Phf8-deficient hippocampus from adult mice (Fig. 2a). The basal
synaptic transmission was also significantly increased, as shown
by the higher value of the postsynaptic fEPSP slope against dose-

escalating intensities of stimuli (10–100 μA) in the KO mice
(Fig. 2b).
To identify whether the enhancement of basal synaptic
transmission in KO mice was mediated by pre- or postsynaptic
mechanisms, we further analyzed changes in fiber volley
amplitude at different stimulus intensities, as well as changes in
the fEPSP slope at different fiber volley amplitudes. No difference
was shown in the fiber volley amplitude vs. stimulus intensity plot
between KO mice and WT mice (Fig. 2c). The input/output
curves obtained by plotting the fEPSP slope vs. fiber volley
amplitude were, however, significantly shifted to the left in KO
mice compared with the curves obtained in the WT mice
(Fig. 2d). In addition, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) experiments
across different inter-stimulus intervals revealed no differences
between KO and WT mice (Fig. 2e). Taken together, these results
suggest that postsynaptic changes rather than presynaptic
changes occur in the Phf8-deficient mice.
Phf8 null mice show hyperactive mTOR signaling. To deter￾mine the molecular basis of defective LTP and learning/memory
in Phf8 mutant mice, we collected hippocampal tissues for gene
expression profiling by microarray analysis. As compared with
control mice tissues, we found that 1954 genes were upregulated
while 1581 genes were downregulated with at least 1.5-fold
change in PHF8-deficient hippocampus. One previous study
identified genome-wide binding sites of PHF8 in human
neuronal-like cell line by CHIP-seq (chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing)15. Thus, we
converted these human homologous gene names into mouse
using a table reported previously26. Among all the differential
expressed genes in our data set, 526 upregulated and 471
downregulated genes contained PHF8-binding loci (Supplemen￾tary Fig. 4). Notably, Rps6ka1, Kras and CamKII, the key mole￾cules in both Neurotrophin signaling pathway and LTP signaling
pathway, were identified in gene ontology analysis in PHF8-
deficient hippocampus (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplemen￾tary Table 2). Using quantitative real-time PCR, we confirmed the
upregulation of transcripts in the KO mice (Fig. 3a). Con￾cordantly, the protein expression of Rps6ka1-encoded RSK1 and
Kras-encoded KRAS was significantly increased in the Phf8 null
hippocampus (Fig. 3b). We did not find the upregulation of total
and phosphorylated CaMKII (including isoforms), although the
mRNA level of Camk2d encoding CaMKIIδ was elevated in the
mutant mice (Fig. 3a, b).
Signaling through Ras-RSKs-mTOR-S6K pathway regulates
multiple processes involved in protein synthesis including
translation initiation, rate, and biogenesis of ribosomes27,28.
Upon stimulation of neurons with growth factors, RSKs are
activated and phosphorylated by Ras-mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) cascade27,29. The activation of RSKs proceeds to
promote mTOR signaling to its downstream targets ribosomal S6
kinase (S6K) and then enhance protein translation27. Given that
KRAS as one of Ras family members and RSK1 as one of RSK
isoforms were upregulated by deletion of Phf8 in hippocampus,
we wondered whether RSKs-mTOR-S6K signaling cascade is

overactivated in mutant mice. Thus, we examined the phosphor￾ylation level of RSK1, mTOR, and ribosomal protein S6 by
immunoblotting. Indeed, loss of Phf8 in the brain conspicuously
increased phosphorylated RSK1, mTOR and S6 but not total
expression of mTOR and S6 (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Fig. 5a
and b), indicating hyperactive mTOR signaling in mutant mice.
Phf8 regulates Rps6ka1 expression by H4K20me1 demethyla￾tion. It has been suggested that H4K20me1, predominantly lying
downstream from TSS, may participate in active
transcription30,31. Recent studies identified PHF8 as an
H4K20me1 demethylase and binds its regulated genes at the loci
of transcription start site (TSS)13,14, thus raising the question of
whether PHF8 actively represses target gene expression by
demethylation of H4K20me1. To investigate how PHF8 regulates
gene expression, we performed Chip-qPCR as well as sequence
assay and focused on four PHF8 targeting genes: Rps6ka1; Kras;
Camk2d; and Mapk14, among which, Rps6ka1, Kras, Camk2d
were overexpressed in Phf8 KO mice, while Mapk14 was not
changed. Following immunoprecipitation with antibodies against
PHF8, H3K9me2, or H4K20me1, we quantitatively analyzed the
abundance of immunoprecipitated DNA fragments at the loci of
transcription start site (TSS, amplicon 2), as well as upstream
(amplicon 1) and downstream (amplicon 3) of TSS for each target
gene (Fig. 4a). Our data showed that PHF8 specifically bound TSS
of its target genes but not non-TSS sites (Fig. 4b). The genetic
ablation of PHF8 abolished its binding to TSS, verifying the
specificity of PHF8 antibodies for CHIP assay. Interestingly, loss
of Phf8 increased the enrichment of H4K20me1 rather than
H3K9me2 at TSS of three overexpressed PHF8 targeting genes,
but not at the TSS of Mapk14, whose expression was not changed
in the hippocampus of Phf8 KO mice (Fig. 4c, d and Supple￾mentary Fig. 6). Our results from microarray and ChIP analyses
coincide with previous observation showing that the magnitude
of H4K20me1 peaks correlates with highly expressed genes31,32.
Thus, these data suggest that PHF8 specifically binds to the TSS
target genes including mTOR activator Rps6ka1 and suppresses
gene transcription by demethylating H4K20me1.
mTOR inhibitor rescues learning/memory and LTP impair￾ments. Overactivation of mTOR signaling has recently been
reported in mouse models with intellectual disability20,21. Sup￾pression of hyperactive mTOR signaling by rapamycin rescues
the long-term memory impairment in animal models with
tuberous sclerosis or overexposure to cannabinoids20,33. Given
the overactivation of Ras-RSKs-mTOR-S6K signaling cascade in
Phf8-deficient mice, we sought to test whether rapamycin
administration could ameliorate the learning and memory deficits
of mutant mice. Because both hyperactive and hypoactive mTOR
signaling impairs long-term synaptic plasticity in
hippocampus33,34, we first optimized the dose of rapamycin by
evaluating the level of phosphorylated S6 (pS6) in hippocampus
after drug application in animals for 3 consecutive days. Our data
showed that low dose of rapamycin (5 mg kg−1) rescued the pS6
to normal level but high dose (10 mg kg−1) completely disrupted
mTOR signaling (Supplementary Fig. 7). We then assessed the
learning and memory performance of Phf8 mutant mice in
Morris water maze and Barnes maze after a 3-day pre-application
of low-dose rapamycin. In water maze test, we performed the
same procedure as previous two groups test (WT vs Phf8 KO)
that probe tests did at 3, 5, and 7 days following training.
Importantly, rapamycin treatment improved the preference of
mutant mice for target quadrant at day 5 in Morris water maze,
although there were no differences between vehicle and
rapamycin-treated groups at day 3 and 7 (Fig. 5a). The escape
latency to reach the hidden platform and the average swimming
speed during training were also measured (Supplementary Fig. 8a
and b). Barnes maze, another task to assess spatial memory, was
also performed in our mice model. The data showed that rapa￾mycin treatment improved the Phf8 KO mice performance in the
latency to the target hole during the training days (Fig. 5b) and
numbers of target pokes (Fig. 5c), time in the zone (Supple￾mentary Fig. 8g) in the probe test. Except for spatial memory,
aversive memory was used to evaluate by contextual fear con￾ditioning and passive avoidance test. We did not find the reversal
of impaired cued memory (Supplementary Fig. 8c). However,
Phf8-deficient mice with rapamycin treatment could enhance the
fear memory in passive avoidance test (Fig. 5d). In addition, other
locomotion and adaptive behavior were also assessed by rapa￾mycin treatment. The mobility and social ability of mutant mice
was not affected by rapamycin administration (Supplementary
Fig. 8d and e). The increased spontaneous activity of mutant mice
could not be rescued by rapamycin in Phf8-deficient mice (Sup￾plementary Fig. 8f). Thus, we show that low-dose rapamycin
ameliorates spatial memory loss in Phf8 null mice.
Furthermore, we examined the effect of rapamycin treatment
on abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity in Phf8 null
hippocampus. The animals were treated with low-dose rapamycin
for 3 days before and on the day of the electrophysiological
recording on acute hippocampal slices (see Methods in detail).
The results from extracellular field recording showed that
rapamycin treatment significantly reversed the impaired LTP
induction and shifted synaptic input–output curve in Phf8-
deficient hippocampus in comparison to the control hippocam￾pus (Fig. 6a–d). The paired-pulse facilitation ratio was not altered
by rapamycin in either control or mutant mice (Fig. 6e). These
findings indicate that application of rapamycin can rescue the
abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity, suggesting that
overactivation of mTOR signaling pathway is involved in
impaired learning/memory and synaptic potentiation.
Discussion
Our results reveal that histone demethylase PHF8 epigenetically
represses the transcriptional activation of Ras- and RSK1-
encoding genes by demethylating H4K20me1 at TSS of target
genes (Fig. 6f). The loss of Phf8 in mammalian brain results in
hyperactive mTOR signaling, impaired LTP, and learning/mem￾ory deficits. Administration of low-dose rapamycin to adult Phf8-
deficient mice normalizes RSK-mTOR-S6K signaling pathway,
and restores LTP and memory loss. This study uncovers the
molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Phf8 mutation￾mediated mental retardation, thus providing potential therapeutic
strategy against XLID.
Aberrant epigenetic machinery caused by genetic mutations in
one of the essential components has been shown to lead to X￾linked mental retardation9. Large-scale genetic studies have
identified a plethora of XLID-associated epigenetic regulators in
X chromosome2. The epigenetic function of these genes such as
Fmr1, Mecp2, Ftsj1, Xnp, Jar1d1c, Znf41, Phf6, and Phf8 range
from mRNA translation, DNA methylation, histone modification
to chromatin remodeling2. Previous genetic studies demonstrated
that patients with familial Phf8 mutations display syndromic
XLID with cleft lip and palate10–12. Here we generated Phf8
knockout mice to model XLID in patients. The loss of Phf8 in
mouse brain caused significant deficiency in learning/memory
and contextual cued memory. Interestingly, hippocampal activity￾dependent LTP, one of the most important forms of synaptic
plasticity underpinning learning and memory, was compromised
in Phf8 null mice. Beyond intellectual disability, impaired adap￾tive functioning is also observed in XLID patients. Social

communication tests and behaviors in response to the environ￾ment are used to evaluate adaptive functions in mouse model
studies, Phf8 KO mice showed no significant difference in the
social ability test here. However, Phf8 KO mice display hyper￾activity in the unfamiliar environment of open field and
impairments in passive avoidance test and fear conditioning. In
these unavoidable and unexpected conditions, mice need adaptive
functions to deal with the stress and tasks. The role of PHF8 in
adaptive behavior requires further investigations for making
conclusions as we did for learning and memory here.
A recent paper reported that a different strain of Phf8-deficient
mice showed resilience to stress induced anxiety- and depression￾related behavior and no intellectual disability35. Although both
our study and those in ref. 35 found the Phf8-deficient mice
showed hyperactivity in open-field test, our Phf8 KO mice dis￾played a significant intellectual disability in water maze, Barnes
maze and passive avoidance performance as well as LTP deficit.
The difference of behavior phenotype in Phf8-deficient mice in
two studies may be due to the genetic factors. Our testing mice
were at least the fifth-generation progeny of a backcross into
C57BL/6 J mice while the KO mice in ref. 35 were maintained on
a 129/B6 background. In addition, subtle difference in the
methods for behavioral testing may contribute to the difference in
phenotype. Our study used a classical 5-min training protocol for
contextual fear conditioning to evaluate fear memory, and mea￾sured the freezing level for 5 min 24 h later. The other study35
used different training regimen and testing protocol which may
have resulted in memory traces of different strength.
It has been suggested that homeostatic protein translation is
precisely controlled by mTOR signaling during learning and
memory processes20. Previous studies showed that disruption in
mTOR pathway impairs learning/memory and synaptic

plasticity20,33,34,36. Our results showed hyperactive of mTOR
signaling in Phf8 mutant mice. And pharmacological inhibition of
hyperactive mTOR signaling with rapamycin rescued the
impaired LTP and memory loss in Phf8 mutant mice. Taking
together, the data indicated that Phf8-mediated overactivation of
mTOR signaling is essential for normal cognition and synaptic
plasticity. Besides, Akt-mTOR pathway was reported to be
regulated by PHF8 in cardiac system and rapamycin treatment
could rescue the effects of PHF8 loss in neonatal rat ventricle
myocytes37.
Morris water maze was widely used to evaluate spatial learning
and memory in rodent. Our data (Fig. 5a) indicated that neither
Phf8 mutant mice nor their wild-type littermates with vehicle
treatments had been enough trained to find the platform on
probe test 1. However, after two more days’ training, vehicle￾treated Phf8 mutant mice still displayed obvious learning deficit
compared to wild-type littermates on probe test 2, while rapa￾mycin injection rescue the learning deficit. And with excessive
two more days training, all groups learned the location of the
platform at the probe test 3. We noticed that vehicle-treated Phf8
mutant and wild-type mice did not show the exact same per￾formance at probe test 1 and probe test 3 as those without
treatments in Fig. 1a. It may be due to some unknown effects on
water maze performance by daily injection. According to previous
studies, daily injection as a mild stress, which can increase the
synthesis and release of hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing
factor38, had effects on rodent behaviors such as elevated plus
maze and open field39,40. The difference on water maze perfor￾mance of mutant mice with or without daily injection was also
seen in a previous study20. The mechanism of the puzzle needs to
be investigated in the future study.
As a histone demethylase, PHF8 has recently been reported to
function as an H4K20me1 and H3K9me2 demethylase13,14. We
found that PHF8 was specifically recruited to the TSS of its target
genes. Loss of PHF8 in mouse hippocampus led to an increased
enrichment of H4K20me1 but not H3K9me2 at TSS region, and
thereby an upregulation of target genes including RSK1 and
KRAS. To date, the role of H4K20me1 in transcriptional reg￾ulation remains controversial. Recent CHIP-seq analyses in
mammalian cells show that H4K20me1 correlates with highly
expressed genes and associates with TSS regions30–32,41, while
other studies suggest that the binding of H4K20me1 to promoter
region mediates the transcriptional repression14,42. Therefore, the
genomic loci of H4K20me1 enrichment may determine its role in
transcriptional activation or repression. Our results in mamma￾lian brain suggest that PHF8 represses transcription of target

the findings showing H4K20me1 as a marker for gene tran￾scription activation43.
Taken together, we provide an animal model mimicking the
mental retardation of patients with Phf8 mutation to study the
neuropathology of XLID and show that loss of PHF8 in animals
causes deficient learning and memory by epigenetic disruption of
mTOR signaling. Importantly, low-dose rapamycin can reverse
the impaired memory loss and synaptic plasticity, providing a
therapeutic drug target to treat Phf8-associated XLID. Future
studies with brain-wide neural circuit mapping and genome-wide
epigenetic regulation of genes in Phf8 mutant mice will further
elucidate the circuit mechanisms underlying disrupted cued
memory and increased spontaneous activity as well as epigenetic
mechanisms for general gene regulation.

Methods
Mice. To investigate the role of PHF8 in mammalian brain, we generated Phf8 KO
mice with a 129/S6/SvEv-background via homologous recombination. For the
targeting vector, the exons 7 and 8 encoding the code region of the JmjC deme￾thylase domain were flanked by two loxp sites. The strategy of design was presented
in detail22 in previous work. Embryonic stem (ES) cell candidates were screened via
negative selection and genotyping. The heterozygous female Phf8+/− mice, gener￾ated by breeding Phf8+/F mice with EIIa–Cre mice, were backcrossed with C57BL/
6 J wild-type male mice for at least 5 generations. The hemizygous male Phf8−/Y
mice were then produced by crossing pure Phf8+/− heterozygotes with C57BL/6 J
mice.
The mice were maintained on ad libitum food and water, and housed in groups
of five to six mice per cage. The housing room was maintained at 23 °C on a 12 h
light/dark. Eight to 12 weeks old male Phf8−/Y and their wild-type littermates were
used in the study. For behavioral tests, mice were grouped by random double￾blinded method. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Shanghai Institutes for Biological
Sciences.
Alcian blue and alizarin red staining. Littermate animals obtained from each
group were killed to collect the skin, muscle, and fat. The tissues were fixed in 100%
ethanol for 4 days and then transferred to acetone for another 3 days. Mice were
then stained with alcian blue (0.15%) in a solution containing ethanol and glacial
acetic acid (8:2) for 2 days. Then, they were stained in an alizarin red (0.05%)
solution containing 2% KOH. After staining, mouse samples were transferred to a
1% KOH solution until their soft tissues were dissolved, and they were then pre￾served in 100% glycerol.
Water maze. Water maze testing was conducted in a large circular pool (diameter:
120 cm, height: 50 cm) made of white plastic. The pool was filled to a depth of 35
cm with water (maintained at 20 ± 1.0 °C) covering a transparent circular platform
10 cm in diameter. The platform was submerged approximately 0.5–1.0 cm below
the surface of the water. The pool was located in a room with diffuse lighting and
with a number of visual cues hung on the wall and. The swimming activity of each
mouse was monitored and tracked via a television camera mounted overhead,
which relayed information, including variables such as latency to the platform, total
distance traveled, time and distance spent in each quadrant, to a video tracking
system.
Each day, a trial was initiated by placing each mouse in the water facing the
pool wall in one of the four quadrants, which was randomly selected. For each
training trial, the mouse was allowed to swim for 60 s to find the hidden platform.
When successful, the mouse was allowed a 30 s rest period on the platform (timed
manually with a stopwatch). If unsuccessful within the allotted time period, the
mouse was guided to the platform and allowed a 30-s rest period on the platform.
Each mouse underwent two session of two trails (inter-trial interval=30 s) for seven
consecutive days. Two consecutive trails were considered to be one session. After
all the animals had completed one session, they then performed the second session.
The probe trials were conducted on days 3, 5, and 7 after training. The platform
was removed from the pool and the mice were allowed to search for it for 60 s. The
percentage of time spent in the target quadrant was analyzed. The swimming speed
of tested mice below 10 cm s−1 were regarded as floating and excluded from the
data analysis.
Contextual fear conditioning. For contextual fear conditioning test was per￾formed in the chambers from Med Associates Inc. During the training phase, mice
were individually placed in the training context with three 0.75 mA foot shocks (2 s
each, 1 min interval) after 2 min of exploration in the chambers. Training sessions
were 5 min in duration. Mice were then returned to their home cages. 24 h after
training, mice were placed back to the chamber with same training context for 5
min, the percentage of the freezing time was assessed for each mouse.
Open field. Mice were habituated in the testing room 60 min before the open-field
test. Each mouse was gently placed in a square plexiglass box ((27.5 cm L × 27.5 cm
W × 18 cm H) and was allowed to explore freely for 20 min. After each trial, the
box was swept out with water that contained 0.1% detergent. The total distance of
movement was automatically recorded and calculated using EthoVision XT v10.0
tracking software (Noldus, Wageningen, the Netherlands).
Rota-rod test. In the rota-rod test, mice were placed on an accelerating rota-rod
cylinder (Ugo Basil, Italy). The rota-rod was accelerated from 4 to 40 r.p.m. in 5
min, the duration of each mice remained on the rota-rod during 5 min test. The
time of duration was measured for five trails (inter-trial interval=60 min).
Three-chamber social interaction test. The Sociability test was measured in a
three-chamber plexiglass box (60 cm L × 40 cm W × 30 cm H). Animals were
habituated to the apparatus by placing them in the middle chamber and allowing
them to explore the box for 10 min, with the doorways into the two side chambers
open. In the test phase, an unfamiliar mouse (a 4-week-old C57BL/6 J female) was
enclosed in a cylinder and placed in one of the side chambers, an empty cylinder
placed in the other side chamber. The test mouse was allowed to explore the entire
apparatus for a 5 min session. The duration time mouse stayed in every chamber
and total sniffing time on cylinder were recorded by EthoVision XT tracking
software.
Passive avoidance performance. Passive avoidance performance was assessed in
Shuttle-box compartments (#ENV-010MC; Med Associates) in which one side of
the shuttle-box was darkened and a light illuminated the other. On Day 1
(Training), each mouse was placed singly in the light chamber and allowed to
explore by opening the door. When mouse entered into the dark chamber, the door
controlled by the computer closed automatically. After 2 s entering the dark
compartment, the mouse received a shock of 0.5 mA for maximum 5 s, and then
mouse was returned to its home cage. The initial latency to enter the dark com￾partment was recorded. Animals remaining in the light compartment for more
than 180 s during the training session received no shock and were excluded from
the retention test. The memory retention test was performed on the next day
without any shock; the mice were again positioned in the illuminated chamber and
the time taken to enter the dark compartment was recorded as the retention
latency. A maximum retention latency of 300 s was given to mice. After each trial
the apparatus was cleaned.
Barnes maze. The Barnes maze consists of a circular platform (92 cm of diameter)
with 20 equally spaced holes (5 cm diameter ; 2 cm around the hole define as zone;
7.5 cm between holes) along the perimeter and is elevated 105 cm above the floor.
On the pre-training trial, the mouse was placed in the middle of the maze, and pre￾trained to enter the escape box by guiding it to the escape box and remaining there
for 30 s. Following the pre-training trial, the first trial started. At the beginning of
each trial, the mouse was placed in the start point, the trial ended when the mouse
enters the goal tunnel or after 3 min have elapsed, the mouse was allowed to stay in
the tunnel for 1 min. Mice were trained four trials per day for 4 days. Trial interval
was 15 min. After each trial the maze was cleaned with 5% ethanol solution. Trials
were recorded and analyzed by EthoVision tracking system.
Electrophysiological recordings. Acute hippocampal slices (400 μm) were pre￾pared by a vibratome (Vibratome, St. Louis, MO, USA) in ice-cold artificial cer￾ebrospinal fluid(ACSF) containing 119 mM NaCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl,
2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaH2PO4 and 11 mM D-glucose, and
recovered at 25–26 °C for at least 2 h before recording, saturated in 95% O2 and 5%
CO2. For recording, slices were continuously perfused with O2 -saturated ACSF
(25 °C) at a rate of 2 ml min−1. Extracellular field potential were recorded by using
glass electrodes (5–15 MΩ resistance, filled with 3 M NaCl) which was placed in
stratum radiatum with ~100 μm away from stimulating electrode. Extracellular
stimuli were administered on the border of the CA1 region along the Schaffer￾collaterals every 15 s using bipolar platinum electrodes with 0.2 ms constant￾current pulse.
All subsequent experimental stimulus strength was adjusted to obtain evoked
extracellular field potential (fEPSP) with the initial slope of 0.15–0.20 mV ms−1 in
Fig. 6 Rapamycin treatment rescues electrophysiological deficits in Phf8 null mice. a The slopes of fEPSP before and after tetanic stimulation are recorded
from hippocampal slices. Despite that rapamycin administration does not affect the LTP induction and maintenance in wild-type mice (WT/Veh, n =
8 slices from six mice; WT/Rap, n = 7 slices from four mice; unpaired two-tailed t-test, p = 0.9317), the deficient LTP in Phf8 null mice (KO/Veh, n =

0.2753). For the electrophysiological recording to evaluate basal transmission, we used 10 slices from seven mice for the WT group with vehicle injection
and 10 slices from five mice for the other three groups. f Working model describing the mechanisms underlying the Phf8 deletion induced cognitive

each slice. Slices were stimulated for at least 30 min to establish a stable baseline
before applying tetanus stimulus. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced with
a tetanus stimulation (1 train of 100 Hz stimulation for 1 s). For the calculating of
input–output relationships, the stimuli were delivered with gradually increasing
current (from 10 μΑ to 100 μΑ in 10 μΑ increments). For the test of paired-pulse
facilitation, two pulses with different inter-stimulus intervals (25, 50, 100, 200, or
300 ms) were applied.
mRNA profiling. Total RNA was isolated from hippocampi using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using reagents from a reverse transcription kit
(FSQ 301, Toyobo). qPCR was performed using SYBR Green 5× PCR Master Mix
(QPS-201, Toyobo) in a real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All reactions
were performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. The primer
pair efficiencies were determined based on the slope of standard curve that was
generated after plotting the results of the titration of the target cDNA (CT vs.
Logarithm of template concentration). The efficiency is calculated as: E = 10(−1/
slope)−1. The efficiency of primer pair should be between 90–110%. All the primer
sequence and amplification efficiencies are listed in Supplementary Table 3 and
Supplementary Table 4.
Microarray data analysis. In the microarray experiment, hippocampus from three
Phf8 KO mice or their wild littermates were tested as a sample for affymetrix chip.
The data was analyzed by GeneSpring software, and filtered the probe with ‘A’ call
besides 1.5-fold change cutoff criterion used in the differential expression. As none
PHF8 antibodies were found appropriate for Chip sequence of mice tissue so far,
we then downloaded PHF8 Chip-seq data from Helin’s lab which were obtained
from human neuroblastoma cells, all RefSeq genes with binding signals on pro￾moter regions (TSS+−2kb) were identified as PHF8-bound proteins. Taking
account of the orthologous genes in human and mouse, we converted the phf8-
bound human gene names into mouse’s homologous gene names (using the table
of homologous genes of human and mouse reported previously26. These genes were
chosen to combine with differentially expressed genes from microarray, and GO
analysis was then conducted on DAVID website (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/).
Immunohistochemistry. Mice were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and
perfused transcardially with saline followed by 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) with
1% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). The brains were then removed
and post-fixed in the same fixative for 4 h at 4 °C, and immersed in 30% sucrose in
PB for 24–48 h at 4 °C Transverse brain sections (14 μm) were cut in a microtome
cryostat and processed for immunofluorescence. All the sections were blocked with
5% normal goat serum in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) with
0.5% Triton-X-100 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated over 48 h at 4 °C
with primary antibody PHF8 (ab36068, Abcam) and NeuN (MAB377, Millipore).
The sections were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Alexa 488
conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes), Alexa 594 conjugated
goat anti mouse IgG (1:1000, Molecular Probes), and DAPI (1:1000, Sigma).
Omission of the primary antibody served as a negative control. The stained sections
were examined with a laser scanning confocal microscope (TCS SP5, Leica).
Western blotting. The protein extracted from hippocampus was quantified using
the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equivalent protein were subjected to 8%
SDS–PAGE, and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. After
blocking with 1% BSA, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (from
Cell Signaling Technology): RSK1 (8408, 1:1000), phospho-RSK1 (9346, 1:1000), S6
(2217, 1:1000), phosphorylated S6 (4858, 1:1000), and Kras (ab172949, 1:1000,
abcam), CaMKII (PA5-35501, 1:500, Thermo), Phospho-CaMKII (AP20855PU,
1:500, Acris) mTOR (2983 S, 1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology), Phospho-mTOR
(2971 S 1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology), β-Tubulin (T5201, 1:10,000, Sigma) or
β-actin (a3854, 1:10,000; Sigma), GAPDH (M20006, 1:10,000, Abmart), then
membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody. The blots were detected using a chemiluminescence method (ECL sys￾tem, GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK) and exposed to radiography films. The
intensity of blots was quantified with densitometry using Image J software
(National Institutes of Health). The average blot density from the wild-type groups
was set as 100%. The relative density values from Phf8 null mice were determined
by the average value of the wild-type groups after each was normalized to the
corresponding β-actin. All uncropped blots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin was prepared from hippocampi of
wild-type and Phf8 KO mice. The tissue was broken up and sonicated to a range of
0.3 to 0.5 kb. ChIP-qPCR experiments for PHF8 samples were carried out using the
PHF8 antibody (93313, Novus), H4K20me1 antibody (ab9051, Abcam) and
H3K9me2 (ab1220, Abcam) in a buffer (20.0 mM Tris-HCL, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton￾X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl). The final ChIP DNA and input were dis￾solved in ddH2O and used for real-time PCR. Primers used were shown in Sup￾plemental Fig. 9. Several PHF8 antibodies were tried for Chip sequence assay,
however, none is found adequate for sequence analysis after immunoprecipitation.
H4K20me1 was performed as described before, and ChIP libraries were prepared
with NEB ultra DNA ChIP Library Kit and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X.
Rapamycin treatment. We dissolved fresh rapamycin (LC Laboratories) in the
vehicle solution (specified below) before use. For in vivo experiments, we admi￾nistered rapamycin intraperitoneally once daily at a dose of 5 mg kg−1 (vehicle: 5%
Tween 80 and 5% PEG 400 in ddH2O). We administered injections for 3 days
before tests and on the day of the behavioral tests. Specifically, injections were
performed 3 h before the contextual fear conditioning test and 3 h before beginning
training in the water maze experiment. For the electrophysiology experiment, the
mice were intraperitoneally injected with rapamycin (5 mg kg−1) for 3 days before
and on the day of the electrophysiological recording.
