Review
Early identification of coronary atherosclerotic pathogenic mechanisms is useful for predicting the risk of 
coronary heart disease (CHD) and future cardiac events. Epigenome changes may clarify a significant fraction of 
this “missing hereditability”, thus offering novel potential biomarkers for prevention and care of CHD. The rap￾idly growing disciplines of systems biology and network science are now poised to meet the fields of precision 
medicine and personalized therapy. Network medicine integrates standard clinical recording and non-invasive, 
advanced cardiac imaging tools with epigenetics into deep learning for in-depth CHD molecular phenotyping. 
This approach could potentially explore developing novel drugs from natural compounds (i.e. polyphenols, folic 
acid) and repurposing current drugs, such as statins and metformin. Several clinical trials have exploited epigene￾tic tags and epigenetic sensitive drugs both in primary and secondary prevention. Due to their stability in plasma 
and easiness of detection, many ongoing clinical trials are focused on the evaluation of circulating miRNAs (e.g. 
miR-8059 and miR-320a) in blood, in association with imaging parameters such as coronary calcifications and 
stenosis degree detected by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), or functional parameters pro￾vided by FFR/CT and PET/CT. Although epigenetic modifications have also been prioritized through network 
based approaches, the whole set of molecular interactions (interactome) in CHD is still under investigation for 
primary prevention strategies.

the development of a plethora of high-throughput 
platforms has provided significant impact concerning 
the knowledge of CHD molecular characterization

several non-invasive imaging techniques have been 
developed over the last few years to detect CHD with 
the aim to guide optimal patient management, such as 
coronary computed tomography angiography

Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD) represents a rele￾vant issue for the public health system1). In spite of, 
substantial progress in elucidating genetic and envi￾ronmental risk factors for CHD, these determinants 
can explain a part of overall risk, whereas changes in 
the epigenome may clarify a significant fraction of this 
“missing hereditability”, thus offering novel potential 
biomarkers for prevention of CHD2-6). Atherogenic 
process begins early in human life and it is influenced 
by maternal risk factors7-9) which include epigenetic

major cardiac events, in the absence of clinically evi￾dent underlying obstructive CHD, should be the goal. 
Several non-invasive imaging techniques have been 
developed to rule out and/or detect CHD for optimal 
patient management. Among them, CTCA, which has 
a higher spatial resolution, provides a direct evaluation 
and quantification of coronary artery alteration, while 
CMR and nuclear medicine technique positron emis￾sion tomography (PET) provide indirect CHD infor￾mation, estimating myocardial perfusion and metabo￾lism alterations, thus representing useful tools for 
evaluating CHD in secondary prevention15). Further￾more, emerging hybrid imaging techniques in the field 
of cardiovascular medicine, such as PET/CT and 
PET/MR, provide simultaneous morphological and 
functional parameters15). 
Carotid Ultrasound Imaging 
Carotid artery ultrasound remains a reliable tool 
in the current armamentarium of diagnostic modali￾ties used to assess atherosclerosis and quantify the 
degree of arterial injury at an early stage. The proce￾dure has undergone considerable technological 
upgrades thanks to the introduction of more powerful 
probes, new color flow, and 3D imaging techniques16, 25). 
Its great advantage is that it can be used in a broad 
range of populations, such as children and adolescents, 
where the use of ionizing radiation is not recom￾mended or there may be a low compliance to perform 
lengthy tests26). Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) 
is strongly associated with risk factors for atheroscle￾rotic vascular disease and is an independent predictor 
of future cardiovascular events, thus providing a better 
risk reclassification26, 27). Based on this evidence, the 
test is a recommended clinical tool to assess risk pre￾diction in a wide population of subjects27) (Fig.1A 
and 1B).
CTCA
CCTA evolved not only to reduce radiation 
exposure, but also to optimize image acquisition, 
achieving more spatial and contrast resolution28-31). 
The real revolution for non-invasive anatomical evalu￾ation of the coronary tree has been achieved only 
recently, with the introduction of “fourth generation” 
wide-volume scanners, with up to 16 cm of cranial￾caudal coverage in a single rotation, enabling whole￾heart coverage at one acquisition time point (within 
one heartbeat or volume). It eliminates “stair-step” or 
misalignment artifacts and provides uniform attenua￾tion when evaluating the coronary arteries or measur￾ing contrast attenuation gradients across atheroscle￾rotic lesions29). Furthermore, radiation doses are lower 
with wide-area detector scanners because of shorter 
to individualize/focus treatments and develop new 
diagnostic tools, useful in primary prevention, and in 
subjects in early stages of disease, as well as for second￾ary prevention6, 16). 
Complex diseases and traits, such as cardiovascu￾lar risk factor susceptibility and CHD, are caused by 
perturbations of biological networks. The network 
medicine approach, integrating big omics, imaging 
data, and clinical information, aims to identify patho￾logical interacting genes and proteins, revolutionizing 
disease knowledge and shifting the understanding of 
pathogenic phenomena from a reductionist to a holis￾tic approach17-19). Currently, epigenetics, combined 
with the innovative system biology approach, is useful 
for personalized CHD therapy 20-22). Furthermore, 
unlike DNA variations, epigenetic modifications are, 
potentially, pharmacologically reversible 23, 24). The aim 
of this review is to discuss the network medicine tools 
that could reveal new candidate genes to translate into 
clinical practice as diagnostic, prognostic, and predic￾tive biomarkers, which could shed new light into 
CHD clinical settings and susceptibility to cardiovas￾cular risk factors. 
We performed electronic searches in three differ￾ent electronic databases, including PubMed, Google 
Scholar, and Web of Science, selecting studies in Eng￾lish between 2013 and 2019 and reporting the associ￾ation between CHD and its risk factors into network 
based models, as well as epigenetic-sensitive CHD 
mechanisms. The search syntax considered terms 
related to CHD combined with the terms cardiac 
imaging, system biology, epigenetics, gene expression, 
network medicine, network pharmacology, drug 
repurposing, primary and secondary prevention, pre￾cision medicine, and personalized therapy. Concern￾ing network-based studies, the search provided five 
original genetic studies associated to cardiovascular 
risk factors, ten network based genomic studies for 
primary prevention of CHD, and four network phar￾macology analyses associated with CHD with a possi￾ble impact for personalized therapy. Two epigenetic 
network models identified regulatory pathways and 
key epigenetic and genetic regulators in CHD and 
familial hypercholesterolemia.
Cardiac Imaging for CHD Diagnosis 
and Risk Prediction 
The first step in primary prevention of CHD 
represents non-invasive anatomical evaluation of the 
coronary tree. Then, the concept of primary preven￾tion should be revisited in regard to recent scientific 
achievements and the best advances in diagnostic 
imaging techniques. Minimizing the incidence of

require at least three, or even four, cardiac cycles to 
image the whole coronary tree, which could lead to 
“misalignment” artifacts deriving from the frequent, 
even minimal, variability of the RR interval. Unless 
we assume a perfectly constant RR interval (which is 
not the rule), it is essential to program the data acqui￾sition during a sufficiently extended diastolic period, 
with a consequent increase in exposure, in order to 
post-process each coronary artery position shift 34). 
Since almost cardiac CT systems have now settled 
down, with rotation speeds ranging from 250 to 280 
ms, detector width became discriminant. and it would

either overlapping sequential axial scans or helical 
oversampling. 
Effectively, “temporal resolution” is one of the 
objectives 32, 33). One solution proposed to improve 
data sampling time, and then temporal resolution, 
during CCTA acquisition is based on using two x-ray 
tubes, shifted 90° toward each other 33). Theoretically, 
this technology, based on acquisition of two different 
hearth views at the same time, could lead to a halving 
of temporal resolution, but the true limit of this tech￾nology lies in detector size. It is so small that it would 
Fig.1. Cardiovascular disease prevention
Cardiovascular risk factors begin to exert their detrimental effects in the fetal stage. Cardiovascular risk factors accumulate during childhood 
and adolescence due to unhealthy lifestyles causing subclinical atherosclerosis. Once initiated, atherogenesis continues during adulthood, 
enhanced by additional risk factors, predisposing to the clinical manifestation of CHD as well as cardiac acute events. The early identification 
of atherosclerosis determinants and mechanisms from the stage of subclinical pathology (primary prevention) is essential to plan lifestyle inter￾ventions that reduce risk factor susceptibility. From adolescence to adulthood, primary prevention aims to control the magnitude of risk fac￾tors, which is also supported by imaging screening, such as carotid ultrasound. Secondary prevention and tertiary prevention plans to perform 
appropriate preventive interventions aiming to reduce the onset of obstructive CHD and the incidence or recurrence of adverse events are also 
supported by imaging techniques such as: carotid ultrasound A. assessment of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis of left internal carotid artery 
(ICA); B. spectral doppler waveforms of ICA; C. FFR-CT; D. CCTA (curved multiplanar reconstruction of a stenosis of 50% characterized 
by a mixed plaque on left marginal artery); E. CMR first pass perfusion acquisition; F. CMR late gadolinium enhancement acquisition; G. 82Rb PET/CT Preserved MBF–MFR (＞2); H. Low Dose Gated-CT showing calcified plaque on circumflex coronary artery; I. Off-line

fused have a slower uptake and lower gadolinium con￾centration, appearing as hypointense perfusion defects. 
In a later evaluation, rapid cellular metabolism of car￾diomyocytes produces an early dismissal of intracellu￾lar gadolinium highlighting as strongly hyperintense, 
metabolically slowed down, fibrotic/necrotic tissue 42)
(Fig.1E and 1F). 
Perfusion CMR superior diagnostic performance, 
versus single photon emission computed tomography 
MPI, has been studied in multiple clinical trials, such 
as the CE-MARC study 44). Furthermore, perfusion 
CMR imaging can resolve the differences in myocar￾dial perfusion between subepicardial and subendocar￾dial layers for its high spatial resolution ranging from 
1.2 to 3 mm. This information is clinically relevant 
because the subendocardium is the most susceptible 
layer to ischemia and typically the earliest affected. In 
addition to myocardial perfusion, CMR global and 
regional systolic LV function can also be obtained, 
overcoming objective difficulties of a correct and 
reproducible ultrasound approach, which is strongly 
affected by the patient habitus. CMR has been also 
applied to anatomical coronary visualization. Com￾bined with the development of three dimensional 
acquisition techniques, superior visualization of coro￾nary anatomy was achieved. Nevertheless, CMR still 
remains limited in the visualization of distal coronary 
segments due to inferior spatial resolution45). Research 
in this field could focus on plaque composition assess￾ment as well as coronary flow to provide a compre￾hensive evaluation of the presence, extent, and func￾tional significance of CHD46).
Cardiac PET
Cardiac PET is useful for perfusion, functional 
evaluation, and assessment of myocardial viability 
with high sensitivity and high negative predictive 
value in the diagnosis of CHD and cardiomyopa￾thies 47). PET is more accurate than SPECT for diag￾nosing obstructive CHD and quantifying global and 
regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocar￾dial flow reserve (MFR) 48). 18F-FDG is mostly used 
for metabolic evaluation of myocardial viability (Sup￾plementary Fig.1B) and is considered the most sensi￾tive modality for predicting left ventricular functional 
recovery post-coronary revascularization. Moreover, it 
may help assess plaque metabolism in atherosclerosis, 
allowing prediction of vascular risk inflammation 
(Supplementary Fig.1B) and unstable plaques 49). 
PET has high spatial and temporal resolution, allow￾ing the acquisition of dynamic sequences obtained on 
first-pass extraction at the time of radiotracer infusion 
to quantify resting and hyperemic regional MBF50)
(Fig.1G and 1H). 
be as large as possible to allow the study of the entire 
cardiac area in the smallest number of heart cycles 35).
In addition, the total iodinated contrast material 
volume can be decreased to as low as 40 mL at 5 mL/
sec in patients with normal cardiac output. This new 
generation of scanners combines the almost complete 
absence of beam hardening artifacts or from slices 
misalignment, with a high spatial and contrasto￾graphic resolution36) (Fig.1C, 1D and Supplemen￾tary Fig.1A).
Several studies have investigated the relationship 
between coronary artery stenosis severity and isch￾emia. The COURAGE sub-study showed that, among 
patients with coronary artery stenosis ≥ 70%, only 
32% of patients had severe ischemia, and 40% had 
negligible ischemia by myocardial perfusion37). In 
addition, Tonino et al. pointed out that 20% of lesions 
with ≥ 70% stenosis did not produce ischemia, and 
17% of lesions with 50% stenosis caused ischemia38). 
Recently, software for computing DICOM data, 
obtained with the latest generation of CT scanners, 
has been developed to evaluate, in a non-invasive way, 
the fractional flow reserve (FFRct) and the functional 
impact of stenosis on blood flow all along the vessel; 
values of FFRct below 0.8 are considered expression of 
critical hypoperfusion39)(Fig.1C). The next goals are 
characterizing atherosclerotic plaque and predicting 
plaque instability. The latest generation CT scanner 
can acquire images at two different energies, 80 and 
140 kVp, and perform dual energy computed tomog￾raphy to characterize plaque elements by their CT 
attenuation profiles, which allows differentiation 
between lipids, fibrous and calcification40). In primary 
prevention settings, an important parameter detected 
by CTCA recently gained importance. Indeed, in the 
2018 update of ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines, 
coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring was assumed 
to be a valuable strategy to reclassify CV risk and 
begin statin treatment41).
CMR
CMR is considered the gold standard imaging 
modality for evaluating myocardial function and per￾fusion and detecting myocardial scars without expos￾ing the patient to ionizing radiation42, 43). Indeed, 
CMR provides accurate mapping of myocardial 
edema, fibrosis, and necrosis in follow up and prog￾nostic assessment. With recent hardware and software 
improvements, first-pass perfusion imaging, using 
CMR, has emerged as an attractive alternative to sin￾gle photon emission computed tomography myocar￾dial perfusion imaging (MPI) for CHD detection42).

tion of biochemical processes and provide a new 
molecular imaging pattern in atherosclerosis patho￾physiology. At present, the results appear encouraging 
and may have a wide impact on personalized medi￾cine, allowing an early diagnosis and foreseeing the 
response to new targeted treatments57).
Next, we discuss the most important consortia 
and clinical networks, including imaging data 
extracted from the aforementioned techniques.
Cardiovascular Consortia for Precision 
Medicine Implementation
Since 1948, beginning with the Framingham 
Heart Study, several consortia have been set up to 
improve and harmonize clinical studies for primary 
and secondary prevention. Integral parts of consortia 
are represented by biobanks storing biological samples 
or completed patient genotyping and clinical informa￾tion, thus providing new possibilities in the context of 
personalized medicine58).
By 2002, the possibility of linking data collected 
in childhood through adulthood to future cardiac 
events became a realistic focus with the organization 
of the International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohort 
(i3C) Consortium, collecting data from over 40,000 
children and adolescents and providing three key 
research areas: 1) follow-up of CV morbidity and 
mortality; 2) genetic data collection and analysis; and 
3) repeated assessment of non-invasive vascular mea￾sures (e.g. carotid IMT). Furthermore, several consor￾tia for risk prediction in adulthood have been orga￾nized. CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary ARtery 
DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis 
(CARDIoGRAM) plus The Coronary Artery Disease 
(C4D) Genetics) consortium combines omics data 
from multiple large studies to identify risk loci for 
CHD and MI. 
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 
(WTCCC), Cardiogenics, and CVgenes@target con￾sortia collected adult individuals with CHD and, in 
association with risk factors, performed case-control 
genome wide association studies (GWASs) or identi￾fied several genetic loci affecting the risk of CHD 
development, thus representing attractive targets for 
therapeutic intervention. 
The UK Biobank is a prospective cohort study 
with deep genetic, imaging, and clinical data, along 
with serum metabolic profiles and biospecimens col￾lected from about 500,000 individuals (40-69 years) 
in the UK during 2006-2010. One of the most prom￾ising aims of both the UK Biobank and the 
CVgenes@target Consortium is the application of net￾work approach and machine learning. 
The advent of hybrid imaging overcomes the 
limitations and drawbacks of standalone modalities, 
providing both functional and morphological infor￾mation. Thus, integrated PET/CT and PET/MR sys￾tems have huge potential for cardiac imaging assess￾ment. The incremental value of multimodalities imag￾ing lies in accurate spatial co-localization of myocar￾dial perfusion defects and anatomic coronary arteries 
(Fig.1I and 1J). This combined technology allows 
detection and quantification of the burden of calcified 
and non-calcified plaques, quantification of vascular 
activity and endothelial function, identification of 
flow-limiting coronary stenosis, and, potentially, iden￾tification of high-risk plaques 51)(Fig.1K, 1L and 
1M). PET/CT is today well established in clinical 
routine imaging 51). PET/MR represents a new inte￾grated protocol for simultaneous evaluation of viabil￾ity, perfusion, morphological and functional imaging, 
thus eliminating ionizing radiation and improving tis￾sue contrast 52). At present, 18F-FDG PET/MRI is 
potentially a very promising evaluation technique for 
in vivo imaging of systemic atherosclerosis-related 
inflammation52). 
The selective reorganization of vulnerable athero￾sclerotic lesions represents a major task in cardiovascu￾lar research. 18F-FDG could be used as an inflamma￾tion radiotracer in atheroma to identify sites of active 
inflammation and to predict future thrombotic 
effects 53). 18F-FDG PET is a marker of vascular 
inflammation in large vessels, which is helpful for 
selecting patients who can benefit from new therapies. 
Similarly, Gallium-68, labelled DOTATATE, targets 
the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) found 
on the surface of macrophages. Pre-clinical studies 
have confirmed 68Ga-DOTATATE’s superiority over 
FDG in terms of macrophage specificity in atheroscle￾rotic inflammation and in discriminating between 
unstable and stable coronary plaques 54). 18F-fluoro￾choline (18F-FCH), a PET tracer with potential anti￾inflammatory affinity, shows a strong association 
between large vessel uptake and atherosclerotic 
changes in the arterial walls, with an apparent inverse 
relationship with calcification54). 
Also of growing interest is the use of other radio 
tracers for functional imaging of the atherosclerotic 
plaques, such as 11C-PK11195 55), or tracers of molec￾ular calcification, such as Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF), 
and hypoxia radiotracers, such as 18Fluoromisonida￾zole (FMISO) 56), both to evaluate intra-plaque calcifi￾cation and to discriminate between stable and unsta￾ble plaques. 
The evolution of atherosclerosis and the emer￾gence of new technologies to measure the vulnerability 
of atherosclerotic plaque allow non-invasive visualiza-

mation of the interactome, or the whole set of molec￾ular interactions in cells 60). The network approach 
central focus is on exploiting the complexity of gene 
regulation, metabolic reactions, and protein-protein 
interactions (PPIs), which synergistically interact each 
other 60). By integrating electronic health records, 
omics data, and imaging techniques, network medi￾cine aims to provide specific roadmaps for under￾standing CHD causes and mechanisms and establish￾ing tailored treatments and preventive strategies. 
Indeed, the main goal is to establish a precision medi￾cine approach by focusing on the intermediate pheno￾types (endophenotypes), which may identify risk fac￾tors, provide early detection, predict clinical outcomes, 
and provide innovative drug targets (Fig.2 and 
Fig.3). Clustering and machine learning algorithms 
are used to integrate data in a multi-level analysis, 
aiming to build complex molecular networks 61, 62). 
Networks are composed of nodes, represented by bio￾logical factors such as proteins (protein-protein net￾works), genes (co-expression networks), metabolites, 
and epigenetic hallmarks (regulatory networks), and 
edges depicting their relationship such as physical 
interactions, common metabolic pathways, and shared 
genes63). 
Network Based Approach and Cardiovascular Risk 
Factors
Hypertension pathophysiology is characterized 
by a complex interplay between genes and environ￾mental factors 64). Network approaches were also 
applied to detect novel candidate genes involved in 
blood pressure (BP) regulation and hypertension55). 
Huan et al. performed a co-expression network analy￾sis, identifying 34 genes responsible of BP variation. 
To further assess molecular key driver genes in BP reg￾ulation, weighted correlation network analysis 
(WCGNA) was used to build co-expression networks 
and sub-networks, in which the SH2B adaptor pro￾tein 3 (SH2B3) resulted in a connector gene in the 
different sub-networks, representing a novel target for 
prevention or treatment of hypertension65).
Similar to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia is 
a quantitative trait controlled by the interactions 
among several quantitative trait loci and environmen￾tal factors66). Network studies were focused on Famil￾ial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH). WCGNA identified 
a triglyceride-associated co-expression module 
enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolic pro￾cesses where an hub gene was fatty acid desaturase 3 
(FADS3), classified as a new gene for FCHL disease 
risk67). Another study investigated co-expressed gene 
networks that are potentially involved in FH develop￾ment by integrating GEO microarray datasets and 
Multicentre consortia were also instituted for the 
genetic determination of cardiovascular risk factors. 
The Global Lipids Genetics Consortium covers several 
cohort studies aimed at understanding the genetic eti￾ology of quantitative lipid traits in age groups, starting 
from young adults up to the elderly. Furthermore, the 
International Consortium for Blood Pressure (ICBP) 
focuses on the genetics of blood pressure dysfunction, 
thus providing potential novel therapeutic pathways 
for CVD prevention. The Genetic Investigation of 
ANthropometric Traits consortium ultimately con￾tributes to understanding the genetics of obesity onset. 
The European Research Infrastructure for Imag￾ing Technologies in Biological and Biomedical Sci￾ences (Euro-BioImaging or EuBI) provides physical 
user access to a wide range of technologies in biologi￾cal and biomedical imaging. A biobank service is also 
available, providing different types of biological mate￾rials (DNA, RNA, proteins). The Advanced Cardio￾vascular Imaging Consortium is a program involving 
the collection of data related to CCTA scans patient 
and clinical features. The Cardiac Atlas Project is an 
open source, freely available, large-scale database of 
CMR examinations associated with clinical data in 
order to develop a structural and functional atlas for 
clinical research. In particular, the MESA (Multi-Eth￾nic Study of Atherosclerosis) is a large-scale, cardiovas￾cular study population aiming to investigate the mani￾festation of subclinical to clinical CHD before symp￾toms onset. The PowerShare Network shares medical 
images and patient data for artificial intelligence appli￾cations. 
Cohort studies investigating cardiovascular phe￾notypes over time provides the opportunity to imple￾ment secondary prevention strategies. Indeed, the 
GENetIcs of sUbSequent Coronary Heart Disease 
(GENIUS-CHD) is an international consortium col￾lecting patients with known CHD, at baseline and 
prospective follow up, for cardiac acute events as well 
as biological samples/DNA or completed genotyping. 
Furthermore, the Myocardial Infarction Genetics 
Consortium (MIGen) was instituted to study the 
genetics of early onset MI (men ＜50 and women ＜
60) (Table 1).

Fig.2. Nodes, edges and molecular network analysis
The picture shows basic network analysis principles. The blue circles represent genes or their products (nodes) that are topologically related in 
the human interactome. Each pair of nodes is linked (edges) when a physical or functional interaction occurs between them. The red circles 
represent the seed genes arising from GWASs, OMIM, and literature, which are clustered in the interactome, as a starting point for a molecu￾lar network analysis. By using network-oriented algorithms, it is possible to identify a specific disease module, revealing novel molecular path￾ways underlying disease. The validation of these bioinformatic findings in animal and cell-based models could provide novel useful biomark￾ers and/or drug targets to improve precision medicine and personalized therapy. 
Fig.3. Workflow of network medicine approach in CHD 
characterization and cardiovascular risk factor suscep￾tibility
Individuals may have a similar clinical cardiovascular phenotype 
but a distinct molecular disease profile. Using a network approach, 
patients undergo deep phenotyping with data analysis, thus 
improving precision cardiology. The first step is collecting multi￾omics and imaging big data on CHD and cardiovascular risk factor 
studies from available repositories, consortia, and cohort studies, 
and integrating them to build different types of networks. Machine 
learning methods and statistical approaches are then applied to 
obtain the interactome by identifying disease modules and hub 
nodes at individual level. Functional analysis leads to identification 
of new disease genes and pathways. The next step is validation of 
network findings in cell-based models, small and large animal 
models and in clinical trials. This analytic strategy clusters individ￾uals into groups that are different from those based on clinical phe￾notypes, allowing a deep CHD phenotyping and personalized risk 
stratification and improving the identification of disease biomark￾ers, the prediction and prognosis, and optimize primary preven￾tion.

key driver genes, suggesting a potential role for target 
in CHD73).
Furthermore, Mäkinen et al. integrated 14 
GWASs, including patients and controls of the CAR￾DIoGRAM Consortium, with tissue gene expression 
studies of CHD. WGCNA and Bayesian network 
models revealed specific CHD-associated networks for 
lipid metabolism, coagulation and immunity. A gene 
network involved in antigen processing was strongly 
associated with CHD in which glyoxalase I (GLO1) 
and peptidylprolyl isomerase I (PPIL1) were identified 
as key driver genes. Results were also validated in 
human aortic endothelial cells 74). Huan et al. per￾formed an integrated system biology analysis by con￾structing co-expression networks in whole blood gene 
expression profiles from 188 CHD cases and 188 con￾trols, leading to the identification of 24 co-expression 
modules. Computational analysis using Key Driver 
Analysis algorithm indicated TNFRSF13C and EBF1
as key driver genes75).
PPI networks were also investigated in the CHD 
setting. Li et al. selected a set of 266 CHD disease 
genes as initial seed genes and protein data (Fig.2). 
PPI network analysis provided 10 separate networks, 
and a CHD specific network was distributed into 14 
modules and 114 hub genes. The GO enrichment and 
KEGG pathway revealed novel functional pathways, 
such as the androgen receptor signaling pathway, neu￾ropeptide hormone activity, peptide YY receptor activ￾ity, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and RIG-I￾like receptor signaling pathway, thus providing new 
pathogenic mechanisms in CHD76). Duan et al. pro￾posed an integrated CHD network analysis combin￾ing GWAS genotyping dataset from WTCCC, PPI 
database and pathway annotation information. Using 
GIN software, molecular data were organized into 
specific networks characterized by four modules. 
Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 10 (MAPK10) and 
Collagen Type IV Alpha 2 Chain (COL4A2) emerged 
as significant genes, providing novel clues for clarify￾ing CHD pathogenesis77).
Recently, Wang and Loscalzo developed a novel 
network based algorithm, called the Seed Connector 
algorithm (SCA), to discover disease modules 78). 
Computational analysis identified a CHD network 
module with 88 proteins and 111 interactions com￾prising physiological pathways related to genetic loci 
associated with CHD such as LDL cholesterol and 
lipoproteins, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, inflamma￾tion molecules, cellular proliferation, and vascular and 
vascular tone and nitric oxide signaling. GO annota￾tion evidenced 28 seed connectors (Fig.2), 18 of 
which were associated with the cardiovascular system, 
confirmed the key functional role of seed connectors 
functional pathways of leukocyte subsets from FH 
patients and healthy individuals. A total of 4,232 co￾expressed relationships were identified in patients 
showing dysregulation in lipoprotein and cholesterol 
metabolism as well as neurotrophin signaling (SNARE 
proteins), MAPK pathways, and endocytosis pro￾cesses, suggesting an altered transport of low-density 
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) across membrane 68).
Beyond environmental and lifestyle factors, obe￾sity is highly influenced by genetics at multiple loci 
(polygenic), considering this condition is an inherited 
trait69). Kogelman and colleagues performed a net￾work-based approach study on obesity, building inter￾tissue gene co-expression networks between healthy 
and obese adult subjects from the whole genome 
expression profiles of four tissues (liver, muscle, subcu￾taneous and visceral adipose tissues). Weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed 
that IL-6 and IL1B genes were differentially co￾expressed across tissues in obese patients compared to 
non-obese individuals. Furthermore, an eQTL map￾ping approach, used to detect genes influencing 
mRNA levels, led to the identification of PTPRE, 
IL-6R, and SLC6A5 genes with a putative key role in 
obesity risk70) (Table 2).
Network Based Approach for Primary Prevention 
of CHD
The network approach modularity has also been 
applied for CHD, opening new perspectives in under￾standing pathogenic mechanisms aimed at promoting 
predictive disease models and primary prevention 
strategies 71). Furthermore, several investigations of 
network medicine have been used as a starting point 
for obtaining clinical and biological information from 
consortia and cohort studies. Oguz et al. identified a 
molecular network predictive of advanced coronary 
calcium in CHD, using genotype data from middle￾aged male patients of the ClinSeq® and Framingham 
Heart studies. The GeneMANIA algorithm was used 
to create a functional network associated to “vascular 
aging” functional pathways and significantly related to 
high levels of calcium score, thus providing a robust 
predictive model15, 72).
Several co-expression network analyses were per￾formed to identify key modules and hub genes in 
CHD. Microarray data from patients and controls 
were downloaded from GEO database. WGCNA 
identified 21 modules and 30 hub genes in CHD 
associated to membrane biological processes cellular 
components, and pathway included in hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy. Moreover, hub genes, which pro￾vided glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDPD) 
and S100 calcium binding protein A7A (S100A70) as

13 CVD-related modules. Authors identified several 
hub SNPs related to CHD and the presence of cardio￾vascular risk factors, such as BP, body mass index, and 
HDL-C LDL-C, and triglycerides. The integration of 
gene expression data to the SNP modules showed a 
in CHD characterization78).
Through multidimensional big data (GWASs, 
SNPs and gene expression) from the Framingham 
Heart Study, Yao et al. built an integrated network by 
iterated Transfer-Fusion (TFit) algorithm, identifying

networks were elaborated, using dmGWAS software, 
and a CHD interaction network was built using 
experimentally validated gene interactions and gene 
co-expression in coronary samples. The network con￾tained 53 genes significantly associated with CHD. A 
pathway enrichment analysis revealed an overlap in 
the network with genes involved in regulating periph￾eral arteries with a set of key driver genes, such as 
UBC, CAND, and SMARCA4, suggesting that abnor￾malities in the peripheral vasculature might be also

(MultiPlaque) Study, the outcomes will be to assess 
the vulnerability degree of the atheromatous plaques, 
before and after a MI, based on miRNA analysis, asso￾ciated with invasive and non-invasive data, such as 
coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, opti￾cal coherence tomography, and FFR/CT. A multi￾parametric model for risk prediction will be developed 
to evaluate the risk associated with the vulnerable cor￾onary plaques in patients who have suffered acute cor￾onary syndrome, as well as the determination of the 
rate of adverse events and MACE rates.
A further advancement in the field of epigenetic 
knowledge could represent the employment of epigen￾etic big data in network models. Zhang et al. devel￾oped an integrated systems approach to identify regu￾latory pathways along with key epigenetic and genetic 
regulators in CHD. In particular, multiple resources, 
such as differentially expressed genes and miRNAs, 
known disease genes, and KEGG analysis were inte￾grated using a breadth-first search algorithm providing 
a prioritized core sub-network in which PTEN was 
found to be a key regulator gene. This data was also 
validated on peripheral blood samples of CHD 
patients89) (Table 3). Furthermore, to identify addi￾tional genes related to FH and their interactions, 
Chen et al. performed a transcriptome and miRNA 
network analysis integrating the transcription profiles, 
miRNA datasets, and functional analysis of CHD 
patients, heterozygous FH patients and healthy sub￾jects. In the regulatory network obtained, specificity 
protein 1 (SP1), signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 1 (STAT1), spleen focus forming virus 
and proviral integration oncogene spi1 (SPI1) formed 
local networks with a higher node degree, suggesting 
an important role of these genes in FH. In addition, 
the transcription factor, upstream transcription factor 
2, c-fos interacting (USF2) and the gene, Wiskott￾Aldrich syndrome, were identified for the first time to 
be associated with FH90, 91) (Table 2).
Personalized Therapy 
for Primary Prevention and 
Secondary Prevention of CHD
Due to network medicine ability to reveal hidden 
connections, one field of application could be identifying 
new drug targets as well as drug repurposing19, 24, 92-94). 
These improvements open a new scenario for the per￾sonalized therapy, in which therapeutic strategies are 
customized to a specific genetic background (Supple￾mentary Fig.2). Network pharmacology exploits sources 
in drug-target databases and connect therapeutic and 
targeted proteins and disease-target databases (Table 2). 
Experimental studies have investigated a net￾Recently, in medical imaging, we have assisted 
with a shift from qualitative imaging to quantitative 
assessment through the extraction of imaging bio￾markers by applying artificial intelligence81). Machine 
and deep learning approaches involve using raw imag￾ing data to extrapolate imaging features and, together 
with clinical information and big data, are processed 
into algorithms to build disease models and neural 
networks in order to improve diagnosis, make clinical 
decisions, and predict outcomes towards a personal￾ized medical approach81). Recent studies on machine 
learning approaches exploiting CTCA showed high 
prognostic accuracy in risk stratification and predic￾tion of mortality in CHD patients 82-84). Furthermore, 
in a recent study, a novel algorithm for T1 mapping 
and extracellular volume fraction in CMR was tested, 
providing a better computational efficiency than other 
well-consolidated methods 85).
Pathogenic Epigenetic-Sensitive Nodes in Primary 
and Secondary Prevention of CHD
Genomic variants identified through GWASs 
account for 9% of CHD risk; therefore, a large pro￾portion of the underlying genetic risk remains 
unclear86). The phenomenon of missing heritability is 
attributed to the notion that much of a complex trait’s 
heritability lies in SNPs that do not reach genome￾wide significance association, but rather in epigenetic 
sites associated with transcriptionally activity, thus 
influencing gene expression5). Furthermore, a recent 
study showed that genetic variants have a regulatory 
impact on circulating miRNAs, highlighting an inter￾play between genetic and epigenetic components87).
In Supplementary Table 1, we report a brief 
description of ongoing or completed clinical trials 
from the website https://clinicaltrials.gov/ started 
between 2013 and 2018 and aimed to test epigenetic 
changes as useful tags to diagnose, prevent, and treat 
CHD. Concerning primary prevention, a recent clini￾cal trial aims to evaluate the relationship between 
DNA methylation and the degree of coronary athero￾sclerosis detected by coronary angiography. Due to 
their stability in plasma and easeness of detection, 
many ongoing clinical trials are focused on the evalua￾tion of circulating miRNAs in blood, in association 
with imaging parameters such as coronary calcifica￾tions and stenosis degree, detected by CCTA to char￾acterize the CHD burden88) (Supplementary Table 1). 
Regarding clinical trials for secondary prevention eval￾uation, most analyzed epigenetic tags are still circulat￾ing miRNAs coupled with imaging tools, such as 
PET/CT, to evaluate infarct-related vessels. In the

other approved drugs, such as fasudil, parecoxib, and 
dexamethasone, and natural compounds, such as res￾veratrol, luteolin, daidzein and caffeic acid, thus sug￾gesting a new mechanism of action in CHD interven￾tion and drug repurposing with a network approach96)
(Table 2).
Epidrugs in CHD Personalized Therapy: Focus on 
Clinical Trials 
Looking for novel therapies to treat CHD, the 
possibility of exploiting the reversibility of epigenetic 
changes has been entertained. Indeed, a great variety 
of small molecules with epigenetic and anti-athero￾genic activity have been described in recent years 24). 
Epidrugs can be classified according to their epigenetic 
effects, in particular, acting on DNA methylation or 
histone modification, thus providing strategies to 
ameliorate CHD care and prevent complications. 
Interestingly, some natural compounds, including 
polyphenols, fenofibrates, cocoa, and folic acid, can 
also modulate DNA methylation status, while resvera￾trol can influence chromatin modifications by inhibit￾ing histone modifying enzymes. Furthermore, statins 
and ezetimibe may promote epigenetic-based control 
in CHD prevention through inhibiting HDAC activ￾ity. 
We reported clinical trials on the above-men￾tioned epigenetic modulating compounds in CHD, 
and its risk factors, both in monotherapy and com￾bined therapy, in primary and secondary prevention 
using the website https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (Table 4). 
Cocoa polyphenols were tested as methylation target￾ing drugs in a clinical trial in both hypertensive and 
hypercholesterolemic patients, and resulted in a signif￾icant reduction of DNA methylation levels in patient 
blood cells, with an association between DNA meth￾ylation and three polymorphisms located in the 
MTHFR, MTRR, and DNMT3B, thus suggesting a 
functional effect of these polymorphisms97). Statins 
represent the gold standard cholesterol-lowering agent 
to prevent CHD. Furthermore, the pleiotropic effects 
of these therapeutic compounds may depend, in part, 
on their epigenetic effects, since they can inhibit 
HDAC activity 98). The protective effect of statins for 
primary prevention has also been demonstrated in 
three large clinical studies: the MEGA, the JUPITER 
and HOPE-3 99-102). Another clinical trial for primary 
prevention investigated fenofibrate treatment, in com￾bination with atorvastatin, to test the efficacy and 
safety of once daily fenofibrate assumption on cIMT 
detected by US in dyslipidemic patients with optimal 
levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol after ator￾vastatin treatment. In the setting of secondary preven￾tion, resveratrol, considered a DNA methylation tar￾work-based approach in novel drug target identifica￾tion and drug repurposing for primary prevention and 
treatment of CHD. Recently, Lempiäinen et al. priori￾tized the 68 most likely causal genes for CHD and 
examined their regulatory roles in 286 metabolic and 
vascular tissue gene-protein modules. Co-expression 
networks were constructed by integrating GWAS with 
PPI datasets, and modules were identified with the 
Girvan-Newman algorithm. Module analysis was also 
performed to find novel target for the currently used 
cardiometabolic drugs. The top identified modules 
included several kinases and GPCR genes for which 
drugs already existed (e.g. CXCR4 and CCR1 in cellu￾lar signaling module), or drugs in development, or for 
which drug compounds were not reported (e.g. TRIB3
in the module enriched for extracellular matrix orga￾nization and regulation, blood coagulation and plate￾let activation pathways). These interesting results pro￾vided new opportunities both for drug repurposing 
and for new development in CHD95).
A novel algorithm, called SCA, identified 14 seed 
connector sensitive drug targets not previously 
reported for CHD (Fig.2). An interesting seed con￾nector was Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), the pharmacological 
target of pegaptanib (DB04895) an anti-angiogenic 
drug to treat neovascular age-related macular degener￾ation. NRP1 is a membrane receptor involved in 
physiological and pathological neoangiogenesis and 
arteriogenesis. In the identified CHD module, NRP1 
was linked to the transcription factor REST, FLT1, 
and PDGFD, all of which were involved in cellular 
proliferation and vascular remodeling78). 
In a recent study, Cheng et al. developed a sys￾tem pharmacology-based platform to assess the inter￾play between disease proteins and drug targets in the 
protein-protein interactome to predict CV outcome. 
Computational characterization was evaluated by ref￾erence distance distribution, resulting in four drug 
network-based predictions. From this analysis, 
hydroxychloroquine was significantly associated with 
a 24% reduced risk of CHD21). 
A recent, network-based analysis of novel drug 
pleiotropy and drug repurposing in CHD treatment 
was performed through in silico models by integrating 
known drug-target interactions, CHD genes, and PPI 
data. In particular, two drug-target networks for both 
approved drugs and natural products were assembled 
considering experimentally validated drug-target inter￾actions. Permutation testing identified significant 
associations of 51 approved drugs and 27 natural 
products with CHD, including several well-known 
anti-CHD natural products (quercetin and luteolin) 
and known cardiovascular drugs. Furthermore, com￾putational elaboration provided significant links with

investigated putative beneficial effects of one year met￾formin XL (2000mg/day) treatment in patients with 
left ventricular hypertrophy, CHD, and obesity. Clini￾cal outcomes were assessed for LVH evaluation by 
CMR, fasting insulin resistance index, obesity, and 
improved endothelial function.
In secondary prevention, the GIPS-III trial (Met￾formin to Reduce Heart Failure After Myocardial 
Infarction) tested metformin in patients who have ST￾segment-elevation MI and reported few or no benefi￾cial effects in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction 
improvement, detected by CMR, and the incidence of 
major adverse cardiac events 108). Another trial evalu￾ated the potential efficacy of metformin pretreatment 
in limiting cardiac injury, assessed by troponin con￾centrations, during CABG surgery in patients, report￾ing no significant reduction of periprocedural myocar￾dial injury109, 110).
Conclusions
The possibility of integrating big epigenetic data, 
non-invasive imaging parameters, and clinical infor￾mation in network-based models could provide a rev￾olution for detecting novel specific markers of cardio￾vascular risk, thus improving primary prevention regi￾men. Furthermore, network approaches could open a 
new scenario for personalized therapy, in which thera￾peutic strategies are customized to a specific genetic 
background. Indeed, a promising challenge could be 
applying network modeling approaches to large 
amount of data from consortia, particularly in a 
cohort of children and adolescents, in order to charac￾terize the molecular alterations at the base of individ￾ual susceptibility to develop CHD in the future and 
the incidence of acute cardiac events. Furthermore, 
implementing network studies in patients with known 
CHD could help improve secondary prevention strat￾egies.

This work was supported by “Ricerca Corrente 
2018” grant funded by Italian Ministry of Health. T.I.

get, was used to assess the improvement of endothelial 
function, lipidomic signatures, and cell signaling in 
patients undergoing CABG. 
The efficacy of statins in secondary prevention 
was tested in several clinical trials, both in monother￾apy and in combined therapy. In particular, in the 
FACS-trial, fluvastatin therapy significantly reduced 
the one-year occurrence of major adverse cardiovascu￾lar events in ACS patients 103). Another ongoing trial 
investigates whether additional treatment with high 
doses of statins in patients with stable angina and 
unstable angina, before CABG, can reduce the inci￾dence of major post-surgery complications including 
death, MI, and stroke. 
Folic acid, a well-known methyl donor, was also 
tested in secondary prevention clinical studies, in 
combination with other natural compounds, such as 
vitamins, or drugs, such as statins or methotrexate, in 
the follow up of patients with obstructive CHD or 
previous MI undergoing PTCA or CABG, aimed at 
reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events. 
Simvastatin was also tested in combination with ezeti￾mibe. Results from the IMPROVE-IT Trial showed 
that lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe, plus simv￾astatin, improved clinical outcomes in terms of cardiac 
death, MI recurrence, and stroke 104). 
Curcumin, a component of the golden spice 
Curcuma longa characterized by antioxidant and anti￾inflammatory properties, induce epigenetic changes 
both in terms of DNA methylation, inhibition of his￾tone modifying enzymes, and modulation of miRNA 
expression. No large clinical studies are ongoing, but a 
study reported its putative beneficial effects in patients 
undergoing CABG with a decreased incidence of in￾hospital MI as well as lower levels of C-reactive pro￾tein, malondialdehyde, and N-terminal pro-B-type 
natriuretic105).
Metformin is the most successful oral medication 
for type 2 diabetes (T2D), lowering cardiovascular 
mortality and morbidity106). Metformin can epigeneti￾cally act by inhibiting several histone modifying 
enzymes and DNA methyltransferases 106). Although 
patients who have cardiac disease with T2D comor￾bidity are likely to benefit most from metformin, indi￾cations of cardiovascular benefit have attracted interest 
in repurposing metformin independently from diabe￾tes. To this aim, a clinical trial tested the putative ben￾eficial effects of metformin repurposing in primary 
and secondary prevention in non-diabetic patients. 
The CAMERA trial (Carotid Atherosclerosis: Metfor￾min for Insulin Resistance Study) on overweight 
CHD patients with CHD already taking statins, 
showed no effect on carotid artery IMT measured by 
US 107). The just completed MET-REMODEL trial

(A) X-ray beam impact straightened right coronary artery perpendicular to major axis of wide-appearing patent lumen; (B) a 90°-shifted pro￾jection shows a stenotic lumen. The right evaluation of stenosis could only be derived by directly measuring area of patent lumen, only achiev￾able in a computer assisted three-dimensional study like CCTA. On the right side of the re-elaborations (A and B) are shown three cross sec￾tions of the coronary artery conducted at the point of maximum stenosis, as well as in the immediately preceding and following tract: the 
width of the lumen is clearly demonstrated, but also the atheromatous plaque can also be seen in its peripheral development (open arrows). 
Note the optimal representation of stent in the proximal tract of coronary artery, with absolute lack of artifacts projecting in intrastent lumen.

Supplementary Fig.2. Workflow of network pharmacology approach in CHD
In the current used reductionist approach, after patient clinical evaluation using laboratory and non invasive imaging tests, the risk to develop 
clinical manifestations of CHD and the clinical decision making is estimated on the basis of the current guidelines and risk scores where clas￾sical cardiovascular risk factors are the predominant indicators leading to the “one-size-fits-all” therapeutic strategies. In the network approach, 
big data and clinical variables are collected as well as information about drugs and drug targets and integrated through machine learning into 
network models to create individual molecular/pathway signatures and to identify specific drug sensitive-clinical phenotypes matched to pre￾viously defined disease profiles that can guide the selection of tailored treatments. The appropriate tailored drug or medical procedure (i.e. 
PTCA) is then selected based on this match, to improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the probability of side effects and recurrence.
