Successful heart transplantation following melpha￾lan plus dexamethasone therapy in systemic AL
amyloidosis
Recurrence in the allograft and progression in
other organs increase mortality after cardiac trans￾plantation in AL amyloidosis. Survival may be
improved after suppression of monoclonal light
chain (LC) production following high dose melpha￾lan and autologous stem cell transplantation
(HDM/ASCT). However, because of high treat￾ment related mortality, this tandem approach is
restricted to few patients without significant extra￾cardiac involvement. A diagnosis of systemic AL
amyloidosis was established in a 45-year old
patient with congestive heart failure related to
restrictive cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome,
peripheral neuropathy, postural hypotension,
macroglossia, and lambda LC monoclonal gam￾mopathy. After melphalan and dexamethasone (M￾Dex) therapy, which resulted in 80% reduction of
serum free lambda LC, he underwent orthotopic
cardiac transplantation. Two years later, he
remains in a sustained hematologic remission,
with no evidence of allograft or extra-cardiac amy￾loid accumulation. M-Dex should be considered as
an alternative therapy in AL amyloid heart trans￾plant recipients ineligible for HDM/ASCT.

AL amyloidosis is a systemic disorder, caused by a
monoclonal light chains (LC) producing clonal dyscra￾sia, that mainly affects the kidneys, heart, liver, and
peripheral and autonomic nervous systems.1,2
Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a severe and common
manifestation of AL amyloidosis, associated with a
median survival of approximately 9 months and less
than 6 months once congestive heart failure is present.3
Cardiac transplantation in AL amyloidosis3-10 remains
controversial, because of organ shortage, recurrence of
amyloid in the graft, and progression of systemic
deposits. Encouraging results were recently obtained in
few cases of AL amyloid cardiomyopathy, with sequen￾tial heart transplantation followed by high dose mel￾phalan (HDM) therapy and autologous stem cell trans￾plantation (ASCT). Providing remission of the underly￾ing plasma cell disorder is achieved by HDM/ASCT,
amyloid deposits do not recur in the allograft and extra￾cardiac disease progression is halted, resulting in pro￾longed survival.10 However, because of high treat￾ment–related mortality associated with HDM/ASCT,
this procedure is applicable only to selected cases. We
report here a patient with systemic AL amyloidosis
with congestive heart failure and multiple organ
involvement, whose condition dramatically improved
after cardiac transplantation following sustained clonal
remission induced by melphalan plus dexamethasone. 
Case report
A 45 year-old male patient was referred for severe
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of unknown origin dis￾covered three years before. On admission, he com￾plained of increasing fatigue and NYHA grade III dysp￾noea. Physical examination revealed diffuse oedema,
bilateral pleural effusions, macroglossia, reduced deep
tendon reflexes, moderate hepatomegaly and postural
hypotension without an increase in pulse rate. Nerve
conduction studies confirmed bilateral sensory-motor
neuropathy. ECG showed low voltage QRS complexes
and atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography revealed con￾centric left ventricular and septal thickening (17 mm)
with increased myocardial echogenicity. Left ventricular
ejection fraction was reduced, with a restrictive transmi￾tral flow pattern on doppler examination. 
Biological results were: serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL,
proteinuria 2.1 g/day, total protein 56 g/L, albumin 32
g/L, calcium 2.28 mmol/L. Liver profile coagulation tests
and full blood count were normal. NT-proBNP level was
10,870 ng/L (normal<300). A serum and urine mono￾clonal λ LC was detected. Raised serum free κ LC level
(1,100 mg/L), with λ LC level of 3.1 mg/L and λ/κ ratio
of 0.002 (normal range: 0.36-1) was demonstrated using
the serum free LC assay (Freelite; The Binding Site,
Birmingham, United Kingdom). A 10% plasma cell infil￾tration was found on bone marrow biopsy, without
detectable amyloid deposits on the trephine. 
A kidney biopsy was performed. Biopsy samples were
processed for light, immunofluorescence and electron
microscopy, as previously described.11 A diagnosis of
systemic AL amyloidosis was established after Congo
red (Figure 1A) and immunohistochemical staining with
anti-κ conjugate (Figure 1B) which confirmed diffuse
mesangial and vascular AL deposits, with a typical fib￾rillar ultrastructural organization on electron
microscopy (Figure 1C).
Chemotherapy was introduced six weeks after admis￾sion. Three courses of monthly intravenous melphalan
(25 mg/m2
) plus oral dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1-
4) induced a 78% decrease in serum free κ LC level (241
mg/L, λ/κ ratio 0.04). The patient was put on the wait￾ing list for cardiac transplantation. To limit melphalan
toxicity, therapy was modified to monthly oral dexam￾ethasone alone (40 mg, days 1-4), one course of which
resulted in a further decrease in serum free κ LC level to
45 mg/L (Figure 2). 
Six months after initial admission, the patient under￾went orthotopic cardiac transplantation from a 46 year￾old donor. The intraoperative course was uneventful.
Histologic examination of the explanted heart showed
diffuse infiltration by κ LC amyloid deposits (Figure 1D).
The immunosuppressive regimen consisted of anti-thy￾mocyte globulins and intravenous methylprednisolone,
followed by oral prednisone, cyclosporine A, and
mycophenolate mofetil. Two additional courses of dex￾amethasone 40 mg/day, days 1 to 4, were administered
at months 1 and 3 post-transplantation (Figure 2).
Severe gancyclovir–resistant systemic CMV primary
infection at month 4 required foscarnet therapy, fol-

lowed by persistent worsening of renal function proba￾bly related to combined cisclosporine and foscarnet tox￾icity (Figure 2). Twelve months post transplantation,
serum creatinine was 2.4 mg/dL with proteinuria of 0.7
g/day. A follow-up renal biopsy showed partial regres￾sion of glomerular amyloid, with clarified deposits and
neoformation of glomerular basement membranes on
electron microscopic examination (Figure 1E). Two
years post transplantation, physical examination was
unremarkable, except for persistent moderate
macroglossia. Serum creatinine was 2.1 mg/dL, total
protein 65 g/L, albumin 37 g/L, serum NT-proBNP 654
ng/L and proteinuria 0.27 g/day. Liver function tests and
full blood count were normal. Hematologic remission
was maintained, with normal bone marrow histologic
examination, absence of detectable serum and urine
monoclonal component, and normal serum free κ LC
level and λ/κ ratio of 39 mg/L and 0.67 respectively.
Echocardiography revealed normal heart echogenicity
and left ventricular ejection fraction, with septum thick￾ness of 9 mm and no evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
Neither recurrence of amyloid deposits, nor rejection,
was detected on follow-up endomyocardial biopsies
(Figure 1F). 
Discussion
Despite growing evidence that cardiac transplantation
may be life-saving in patients with end-stage AL amy￾loid heart disease, both the criteria of eligibility for the
procedure, and the place of adjuvant therapies aimed at
controlling the underlying plasma cell disorder remain
unclear.
Only small multicentric series of heart transplantation
in AL amyloidosis have been published.4-10 Not only sur￾vival rates of patients grafted for amyloid cardiomyopa￾thy are significantly lower than in the general cardiac
transplant recipient population,9 but, compared to other
causes of amyloid cardiomyopathy (transthyretin amy￾loidosis and hereditary apolipoprotein A1 amyloidosis),

patients with AL amyloidosis are at higher risk. In one
series, 1 and 5 year survival rates were 86% and 64% in
patients with non AL amyloid cardiomyopathy, com￾pared to 71% and 36% in AL patients who received
post-transplant chemotherapy, and only 50% and 20%
in AL patients who did not receive additional
chemotherapy. Among AL patients, amyloid recurred in
the graft after a median of 11 months, most patients
dying from progressive extra-cardiac amyloidosis.8 In
recent years, the prognosis of AL amyloidosis has been
transformed with the use of HDM/ASCT. However,
intensive therapy is associated with high mortality in
patients with multiple organ involvement by amy￾loid.12,13 In 5 AL patients, selected for the absence of clin￾ically significant extra-cardiac amyloid, HDM/ASCT
performed after cardiac transplantation resulted in sur￾vival times of 91 months and 76 months from surgery
and HDM/ASCT, respectively. Three patients with sus￾tained hematologic remission (normalization or >80%
reduction in serum free LC levels) had no evidence of
cardiac or extra cardiac amyloid accumulation after a
follow-up of 99 months. By contrast, death related to
systemic and cardiac amyloid accumulation occurred in
the two patients in whom plasma cell dyscrasia failed to
respond or relapsed after HDM/ASCT.10 In the present
case, we considered that the significant and sympto￾matic extra-cardiac amyloid deposits prohibited such a
tandem approach due to the TRM risk. In patients with
AL amyloidosis ineligible for HDM/ASCT, the combina￾tion of oral melphalan and high dose dexamethasone
(M-Dex) is associated with a hematologic response rate
of 67% (with 33% of complete response) and an organ
response rate of 48%, resulting in significant survival
benefit.14 Recently, in a randomized controlled trial of
100 patients with systemic AL amyloidosis, M-Dex
showed improved overall survival compared to
HDM/ASCT.15 In our patient, intermediate dose intra￾venous melphalan plus dexamethasone was well toler￾ated and induced a dramatic reduction in both serum
free κ LC and NT-proBNP levels prior to heart transplan￾tation, a factor predictive of prolonged survival in AL
amyloidosis.16 Two years after cardiac transplantation,
complete hematologic remission was maintained,
according to the usual criteria.17 There was no evidence
of either amyloid recurrence in the allograft or disease
progression in other organs, but partial regression of
glomerular amyloid fibrils.
In conclusion, this case report suggests that M-Dex
may result in prolonged survival in AL amyloid patients
with advanced heart failure requiring heart transplanta￾tion, by durably reducing the production of amyloido￾genic LC. In patients with significant extra-cardiac
involvement not eligible to HDM/ASCT, M-Dex is
worth considering before cardiac transplantation.
Dexamethasone dose should be reduced initially to limit
the risk of severe fluid retention, particularly in patients
with both cardiac and renal involvement.18 As suggested
before,10 a rapid 80% reduction in the aberrant serum
free LC concentration probably represents a predictive
factor for prolonged post-operative survival and a strong
argument to validate the indication of heart transplanta￾tion.
