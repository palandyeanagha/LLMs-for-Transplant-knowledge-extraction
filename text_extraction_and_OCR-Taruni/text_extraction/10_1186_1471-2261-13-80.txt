Abstract
Background: Low body mass index (BMI) is associated with a poor outcome in chronic heart failure (CHF). An
inverse association between BMI and adiponectin and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has
been reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether novel markers of neurohormonal
activation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction are associated with BMI in CHF.
Methods: In a cross-sectional study including 171 patients with CHF and a left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) ≤45% the impact of BMI on circulating plasma concentrations of adiponectin, α-defensins, high sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP), copeptin, mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), NT-proBNP, and mid-regional
pro-A-type natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) were evaluated.
Results: In multivariable linear regression analysis including age, sex, LVEF, New York Heart Association functional
classification (NYHA), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and diabetes, only NT-proBNP (β = −0.32) and
adiponectin (β = −0.39) remained independently associated with BMI. MR-proANP was associated with BMI but
adjusting for age attenuated the relation being no longer significant.
Conclusions: Among biomarkers typically increased in patients with CHF only adiponectin and NT-proBNP
demonstrated independent inverse associations with BMI. This indicates a direct effect of these two biomarkers
enhancing the wasting process seen in CHF.

Background
Low body mass index (BMI) is associated with a poor
outcome in chronic heart failure (CHF) and survival is
further impaired if CHF progresses to cardiac cachexia
[1,2]. The underlying mechanisms are still undergoing
intense investigations. Interestingly, a role of the failing
heart in regulation of adipose tissue has been suggested
[3]. Concentrations in plasma of the cardiac natriuretic
peptides (NPs), atrial (ANP) and B-type (BNP), and
the N-terminal fragment of the pro-hormone pro-BNP
(NT-proBNP), are markedly increased in CHF and related
to impaired outcome [4]. Previous studies have shown
that BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations are inversely
associated with BMI, and particularly high levels have
been reported in patients with cardiac cachexia [5-7].
The mid-regional sequence of proANP (MR-proANP)
has emerged as a novel biomarker of survival in CHF.
Available data assessing the relationship with BMI have
not been conclusive and have mainly been addressed in
conditions with acute HF [8,9]. Furthermore, in previously
trials ANP has been reported to be less influenced by
BMI, and the impact on low BMI in patients with CHF
has not yet been clarified.

High levels of the adipocytokine adiponectin reflect low
BMI as well as high insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects
and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Although
adiponectin correlates to BMI in CHF, a paradox seems
to be present, since high adiponectin levels have been
reported to be associated with increased risk of mortality
in CHF [6,10,11], and further reported elevated in patients
with cardiac cachexia, irrespectively of BMI [12].
The development of novel assays targeting pro-hormones
and stable fragments of peptides associated with cardio￾vascular disease (CVD) presents several new biomarkers
with a potential for clinical use. Adrenomedullin (ADM)
is a 52-amino-acid peptide that is expressed in various
tissues and its secretion is stimulated in CHF where high
concentrations reflect poor survival [13]. Circulating levels
of the stable mid-regional fragment of the pro-hormone
pro-adrenomedullin peptide (MR-proADM) is associated
with BMI in obese patients without heart disease, and de￾cline during weight reduction after gastric bypass surgery
[14]. Copeptin is excreted in equimolar amounts to arginine
vasopressin (AVP), as the C-terminal of the pro-hormone
by the posterior pituitary gland, in response to reduced
osmolality and hypovolemia. In CHF copeptin concentra￾tions are elevated and associated with increased risk of
mortality [15]. Previous CHF studies of the prognostic
value of copeptin and MR-proADM have to the best of
our knowledge, not addressed the effect of BMI in details.
Increased low-grade inflammation is an important char￾acteristic in CHF [16]. The traditional inflammatory bio￾marker used in various clinical settings is high sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP). High levels of hsCRP are seen
in healthy individuals with high BMI, and moreover,
weight loss has been associated with decreasing hsCRP
[17]. The recently described inflammatory biomarker,
α-defensins, is elevated in CHF patients and associated
with increased risk of all-cause mortality [18]. The rela￾tionships between circulating levels of these biomarker
and BMI have not been evaluated in earlier CHF studies.
We have previously reported of an association between
BMI and NT-proBNP as well as adiponectin in CHF [6].
However, whether low BMI has an impact on plasma
concentrations of these biomarkers is unknown. Therefore,
we aimed to investigate the association between the
biomarkers examined and BMI in patients with CHF.
Methods
Study sample
From 2000 through −2003, we enrolled 171 patients
with confirmed systolic CHF defined as left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤45% by echocardiography in
combination with symptoms. All patients were recruited
at a specialized CHF clinic at Frederiksberg University
Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. Data on BMI and bio￾markers were available in 171 patients. The original design
of the cohort study as well as baseline characteristics
have been published previously [19]. The investigations
conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration
of Helsinki. The study was approved by the local Ethics
Committee and all patients gave written informed consent.
Laboratory measurements
All patients met at the outpatient clinic for blood sampling
following an overnight fast (8 hrs). Venous blood was
drawn and stored as EDTA-plasma at −80°C in aliquots
until analysis. A urine sample was collected. To determine
the plasma level of α-defensins we used a validated, in￾house, solid-phase RIA. Using microtiter plates (from
Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) incubated overnight at 5 C with
anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Copenhagen, Denmark).
After washing, all wells were added 50 μL of standard
(purified α-defensins-1, Sigma-Aldrich) or diluted plasma
(1 in 25), 50 μL of 125I-labeled α-defensins (∼10.000 cpm)
and 100 μL (200 μg/L) of a specific monoclonal antibody,
which recognizes α-defensins-1, -2, and −3 (clone DEF 3,
BMA, Augst, Switzerland). The intra- and inter-assay co￾efficients of variation (CVs) were 6% and 9%, respectively.
Repetitive freezing and thawing (nine cycles) on serum
and plasma levels of α-defensins did not affect the α￾defensins levels [20]. All blood samples were measured
within the same assay-run. HsCRP was measured with a
latex-particle-enhanced immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics,
Germany). Plasma NT-proBNP was measured by using
a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay based on
double-antibody sandwich technique (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) [21]. To determine plasma level of

total adiponectin we used a validated, in-house, time re￾solved immunofluorometric assay (TR-IFMA) based on
commercially available antibodies and recombinant hu￾man adiponectin obtained from R&D Systems, Abingdon,
UK. The detection limit is <1.5 μg/l. The within-assay
coefficient of variation (CV) of standards and unknown
samples averaged <5%; the in-between assay CV was
8-12% depending on concentrations of adiponectin
[22]. Plasma concentrations of midregional proANP
(MR-proANP), MR-proADM, and copeptin, were mea￾sured on the Kryptor Compact platform (B-R-A-H-M-S,
Henningsdorf, Germany) [23-25].
Statistical analysis
We categorized patients according to BMI levels ≤21 kg/m2
21–25 kg/m2
, and >25 kg/m2
. The cut point of BMI of
21 kg/m2 was pre-specified and used to facilitate com￾parison with previous studies in patients with cardiac
cachexia [1]. We used one way ANOVA for comparing
data with a normal distribution and a Kruskal-Wallis
test for non-parametric data. Parameters with a skewed
distribution (adiponectin, NT-proBNP, MR-proANP,
MR-proADM, copeptin, α-defensins, and hsCRP) were
ln transformed prior to linear regressions and log (2)
transformed prior to Cox proportional hazard analyses.
Hazard ratio (HR) for transformed data was expressed
per doubling in the respective biomarker. In multivariable
linear regression analyses, we examined the association
between BMI as the dependent variable and biomarkers
adjusted for age, sex, LVEF, New York Heart Association
functional classification (NYHA), estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR), and DM. All values are 2 tailed,
and p- values below 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. The statistical software package SPSS version
20.0 was used for all analyses.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Clinical characteristics according to BMI are presented
in Table 1. The patients were older in the lower BMI
categories, they had the lowest prevalence of DM, and
had the highest levels of circulating adiponectin, NT￾proBNP, and MR-proANP. A low BMI (<21 kg/m2
) was
associated with markedly elevated hsCRP concentra￾tions. Fifty-seven% of the patients had ischemic heart
disease (IHD).
Correlations between biomarkers
Both inflammatory biomarkers correlated to MR-proADM
(hs-CRP: β = 0.27 and α-defensins: β = 0.36, p < 0.0001
for both). Adiponectin concentrations were positively
associated with MR-proANP (β = 0.36, p < 0.0001).
Association between BMI and biomarkers
The univariable linear correlation between BMI and
adiponectin, NT-proBNP, MR-proANP, MR-proADM,
copeptin, α-defensins, and hsCRP concentrations was
evaluated. A significant inverse relationship was found
between BMI and adiponectin (β = −0.42), NT-proBNP
(β = −0.33), and MR-proANP (β = −0.19) levels. We did not
find any association with the other biomarkers examined.
Plasma levels of biomarkers according to BMI categories
are shown in Figure 1 A-F. Multivariable linear regression
analyses were performed for each biomarker, adjusted for
age, sex, LVEF, NYHA, eGFR, and DM (base model). An
independent impact of BMI on NT-proBNP (β = −0.32)
and adiponectin (β = −0.39) levels in plasma was observed.
BMI did not correlate to α-defensins, MR-proANP,
MR-proADM or copeptin (Table 2). When eliminating
age from the multivariable linear regression analysis with
MR-proANP, this biomarker remained independently
associated with BMI.
Discussion
We have previously reported that BMI has an effect on
plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in CHF [6]. In the
current study we extended these findings on NPs to
include MR-proANP, reporting that concentrations of both
NT-proBNP and MR-proANP are negatively associated
with BMI. After adjusting for parameters with known
impact on concentrations of NPs, levels of NT-proBNP
remained independently associated with BMI. By contrast,
the other biomarkers examined reflecting neurohormonal
stimulation, inflammation and endothelial dysfunctions
were not related to BMI in the present CHF population.
Low BMI is associated with an unfavourable sur￾vival in CHF and accordingly it may be hypothesized
that biomarkers significantly associated with BMI are

mechanistically linked to the weight loss. In line with this
the interest in the lipolytic role of natriuretic peptides is
expanding. Recently, NPs have been shown to enhance lip￾olysis of adipose tissue though activation of the hormone
sensitive lipase [26]. Furthermore, in experimental studies
of ANP and BNP, an increase in energy utilization and
thermogenesis by enhancing ‘browning’ of white adipocytes
has recently been reported [3], hence, suggesting a patho￾physiological explanation of the inverse relationship be￾tween BMI and NPs. We found a gradual decline in
plasma MR-proANP levels corresponding to an increase
in BMI, which is in accordance with findings of a previous
study by Masson et al. [27]. We did not however, observe
an independent association between MR-proANP and
BMI, after adjustment for age, gender and kidney function.
This observation is in accordance with a study in healthy
subjects, in whom kidney function and age appeared to be
the primary predictors of MR-proANP [28]. Clearance
mechanisms of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP are pre￾sumably not identical. Therefore, these findings support
that secretion from the myocytes of A and B-type NPs are
blunted in obesity [29].
In the present study decreasing BMI was associated
with advanced age and when eliminating age from the
base model, MR-proANP became independently related
to BMI. A recent post hoc analysis from The BACH
trial reported significant differences in MR-proANP
levels between acute HF patients with highest vs. lowest
BMI [8].
Atrial NP promotes adiponectin release in healthy sub￾ject [30]. This association is corroborated by the current
study. More knowledge on this cross-talk between the
heart and adipose tissue may be of importance in CHF.
The inverse association between adiponectin levels
and BMI found in this study has been documented in
both healthy populations and in cohort of CHF patients.
Increased levels of adiponectin have been identified in
patients with extremely low BMI as in cardiac cachexia
[7], a syndrome present in approximately 10% of a CHF
population [5]. In this context, it is interesting that high
plasma concentrations of adiponectin in the more ad￾vanced state of CHF are independent of BMI [12]. On
this basis it has been suggest that adiponectin contributes
to weight loss in cardiac cachexia by increasing energy
expenditure [31].
Chronic low grade inflammation is involved in the
pathophysiology of CHF. We have recently reported
that elevated levels of the novel biomarker α-defensins,
reflecting the innate immune system, have prognostic
implications in CHF patients [18]. Plasma levels of α￾defensins were not affected by BMI in the present study
and this finding indicate that the innate immune system is
not directly linked to the progressive weight loss observed
in CHF with cachexia.
Circulating concentrations of biomarkers reflecting low￾grade inflammation and hsCRP, endothelial dysfunction,
MR-proADM, and water homeostasis copeptin were not
associated with BMI in the present study, even though
hsCRP concentrations were increased by a factor 2 in
CHF with BMI < 21 kg/m2
. In contrast to our findings,
recent data on MR-proADM levels in lean as well as obese
individuals demonstrated a positive correlation to BMI,
with a progressive decrease in plasma levels during weight
reduction after gastric by-pass surgery [14,28]. None of
the novel biomarkers affected the association between
BMI and outcome.
There are some limitations to this study. First, there
are a limited number of patients enrolled in the current
study, which might diminish the statistical power of
detecting associations between BMI and biomarkers.
Second, this study was monocentric and only BMI and
no other anthropometric data were available in this CHF
cohort. Finally, it should be noted that the present ana￾lyses are post hoc analyses on data collected for other
purposes [6]. This may increase the risk for a Type I
error. Whether we have overlooked a small effect of
BMI on α-defensins due to a low sample size (a Type II
error) can neither be excluded and our findings should be
confirmed in larger cohorts.
Conclusions
Among the biomarkers which have been shown to be of
prognostic importance in patients with CHF only NPs and
adiponectin were associated with BMI, as concentrations
of the biomarkers increased by decreasing BMI. As this is
a cross sectional study, our data do not allow us to make
any conclusions about causality, but nevertheless, we
speculate that these peptides may participate in the
mechanisms responsible for the accelerated weight loss
seen in patients with severe CHF.
