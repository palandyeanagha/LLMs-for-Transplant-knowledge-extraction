Abstract
Introduction Aminoglycosides aerosolization might achieve
better diffusion into the alveolar compartment than intravenous
use. The objective of this multicenter study was to evaluate
aerosol-delivered amikacin penetration into the alveolar
epithelial lining fluid (ELF) using a new vibrating mesh nebulizer
(Pulmonary Drug Delivery System (PDDS), Nektar
Therapeutics), which delivers high doses to the lungs.
Methods Nebulized amikacin (400 mg bid) was delivered to the
lungs of 28 mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative
VAP for 7-14 days, adjunctive to intravenous therapy. On
treatment day 3, 30 minutes after completing aerosol delivery, all
the patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage in the infection￾involved area and the ELF amikacin concentration was
determined. The same day, urine and serum amikacin
concentrations were determined at different time points.
Results Median (range) ELF amikacin and maximum serum
amikacin concentrations were 976.1 (135.7-16127.6) and 0.9
(0.62-1.73) μg/mL, respectively. The median total amount of
amikacin excreted in urine during the first and second 12-hour
collection on day 3 were 19 (12.21-28) and 21.2 (14.1-29.98)
μg, respectively. During the study period, daily through amikacin
measurements were below the level of nephrotoxicity. Sixty-four
unexpected adverse events were reported, among which 2 were
deemed possibly due to nebulized amikacin: one episode of
worsening renal failure, and one episode of bronchospasm.
Conclusions PDDS delivery of aerosolized amikacin achieved
very high aminoglycoside concentrations in ELF from
radiography-controlled infection-involved zones, while
maintaining safe serum amikacin concentrations. The ELF
concentrations always exceeded the amikacin minimum
inhibitory concentrations for Gram-negative microorganisms
usually responsible for these pneumonias. The clinical impact of
amikacin delivery with this system remains to be determined.

Introduction
Aminoglycosides are broad-spectrum antibiotics active
against most Gram-negative pathogens responsible for venti￾lator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumo￾nia (HAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), even
those with multidrug-resistance patterns [1]. However, the
systemic use of this antibiotic class is limited by its toxicity and
poor penetration into the lung [2-4]. Also, minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MIC) of still active antibiotics on multidrug￾resistant Gram-negative bacteria, mainly aminoglycosides, are
higher. Aerosol administration offers the theoretical advantage
of achieving high antibiotic concentrations at the infection site
and low systemic absorption, thereby avoiding renal toxicity
[5]. Although available data are abundant for cystic fibrosis,
data on aerosolized antibiotics for mechanically ventilated
patients are scarce, even for aerosolized aminoglycosides,
which are the most studied [6]. Moreover, during mechanical
ventilation, high amounts of the particles dispersed by conven￾tional nebulizers remain in the ventilatory circuits and the tra￾cheobronchial tree before reaching the distal lung and,
therefore, less drug is available in the alveolar compartment.
The Pulmonary Drug Delivery System (PDDS; Nektar Thera￾peutics, San Carlos, CA, USA) is a new vibrating mesh neb￾ulizer designed to provide an estimated 40 to 50% of the dose
administered to the lungs of intubated and mechanically venti￾lated patients, according to in vitro and in vivo data [7,8]. This
high efficiency is explained by the device, which combines a
high-performance generator and a breath-synchronized con￾troller: the aerosol generator, which makes droplets 3 to 5
microns in diameter, consists of a proprietary high-frequency
vibrating element that creates a rapid pumping of liquid drop￾lets through tapered apertures to form the aerosol. The con￾troller delivers aerosol only during the first 75% of each
inspiratory phase. The combination of the two minimizes the
impaction of aerosol droplets in the ventilatory circuits [9].
To evaluate amikacin penetration into the alveolar epithelial lin￾ing fluid (ELF), we performed a pharmacokinetic study on
mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative nosoco￾mial pneumonia receiving amikacin via the PDDS.
Materials and methods
Protocol and patients
The purpose of this multicenter (n = 6) trial was to evaluate the
pharmacokinetics of PDDS-delivered aerosolized amikacin,
combined with intravenous antibiotics, for patients with Gram￾negative VAP, HAP or HCAP. Patients were included when
they were aged 18 years or older, mechanically ventilated, had
nosocomial pneumonia (defined as the presence of a new or
progressive infiltrate(s) on chest radiograph and at least two
of the following: fever, defined as core temperature >39.0°C
or hypothermia, defined as core temperature <35.0°C; leuko￾cyte count ≥10,000/mm3 or ≤4,500/mm3; and new onset of
purulent sputum production or respiratory secretions, or a
change of sputum characteristics [10,11]); and a Gram-nega￾tive organism was detected by Gram-staining of tracheal aspi￾rates. Non-inclusion criteria were: primary lung cancer or
another malignancy metastasized to the lung, known or sus￾pected active tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, AIDS, or Pneumo￾cystis jiroveci pneumonia; severe hypoxemia (partial pressure
of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio <100
mmHg); renal failure (serum creatinine >2 mg/dL or currently
on dialysis); immunocompromised status; neutropenia; body
mass index of 30 kg/m2 or more; severe burns (>40% of total
body surface area); refractory septic shock; known respiratory
colonization with amikacin-resistant Gram-negative rods; and/
or having received amikacin within the preceding seven days.
After inclusion, patients received 400 mg of aerosolized ami￾kacin twice daily (800 mg per day) for 7 to 14 days. Every
patient's trough serum amikacin concentrations were meas￾ured daily. Patients who did not receive three full days of study
medication were excluded.
For the study, a specially prepared, preservative-free formula￾tion of amikacin sulfate formulated for inhalation (NKTR-061)
was used for aerosolization, not a standard intravenous prep￾aration. This solution contained amikacin sulfate at a concen￾tration of 125 mg/mL; pH and osmolarity were adjusted for
inhalation. Prior to starting studies in humans, inhalation toxi￾cology studies were performed to make sure the dose was
safe for inhalation.
The Institutional Review Board of each participating center
approved the protocol, and informed consent was obtained
from patients or their legally authorized representative prior to
enrollment.
Nebulizer
The PDDS Clinical consists of a nebulizer/reservoir unit, T￾piece adapter, air-pressure feedback unit for breath synchro￾nization and a control module (Figure 1a). The nebulizer/reser￾voir unit, which is breath-synchronized and provides aerosol
during the first 75% of inspiration, comprises the OnQ® aero￾sol generator and a conical 6.25 mL drug reservoir, which con￾tains the entire dose and requires no refilling. The aerosol
generator consists of a proprietary high-frequency vibrating
element that creates a rapid pumping of liquid droplets (of 3 to
5 μm) through tapered apertures to form the aerosol. The aer￾osol-generating process is electronically controlled via the
control module. The nebulizer/reservoir unit is connected to
the ventilator circuit through a T-piece adapter between the
Wye-piece and the endotracheal tube. A cable connects the
nebulizer/reservoir to the control module. The air pressure￾feedback (for breath-synchronization) unit is connected to the
inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit and to the control mod￾ule by pressure tubing.
The PDDS is a specialty drug delivery system for single-patient
use. It is designed to deliver medication to adult patients on

mechanical ventilation. The PDDS nebulizer/reservoir unit
operates in phasic, breath-synchronized mode only, providing
aerosol during the first 75% of inspiration during mechanical
ventilation. This is accomplished by the control module sens￾ing a positive pressure breath through the air pressure feed￾back tube. Limiting the aerosol formation to the first 75% of
the inspiratory cycle enhances efficiency of delivery and mini￾mizes exhaled aerosol. The duration of nebulization is depend￾ent upon the patient's minute ventilation. The aerosol delivery
time varies between 45 and 60 minutes [12]. The PDDS is an
investigational device and is not commercially available.
Nebulization technique
During nebulization, patients had to receive positive-pressure
ventilation (i.e., pressure-control or volume-assist control
modes). A heat-moisture exchanger or heated humidifier could
be used with the device. For aerosolization, 3.2 mL of amikacin
sulfate was added in the reservoir.
Aerosols were continued after extubation, the nebulizer/reser￾voir unit was attached to a reservoir unit with a mouthpiece,
one-way valves and an expiratory filter (Figure 1b). In this con￾figuration, the aerosol was generated continuously (not only
during inspiration), and nebulization of the dose was com￾pleted in approximately 15 to 20 minutes in a previous study
[12].
Procedures
Fifteen to 30 minutes after the end of the first aerosolized dose
given on day 3, all patients underwent fiberoptic bronchos￾copy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in an infection￾involved zone, as previously described [13]. After premedica￾tion with intravenous sedatives and a short-acting paralytic
agent if needed (left to the discretion of the treating physician),
the FiO2 was adjusted to 95% or more. The fiberoptic bron￾choscope was advanced to the bronchial orifice selected on
the basis of the radiographic infiltrate location. BAL was per￾formed by instilling a total of at least 120 mL of sterile, non￾bacteriostatic saline. The liquid recovered after the first aliquot
was discarded, and the remaining BAL fluids were filtered
through sterile gauze and pooled. The time between BAL
onset and the total recovery of the six aliquots was kept as
short as possible to minimize free diffusion of solutes, particu￾larly urea, through the alveolar epithelium during the proce￾dure. The entire procedure was well tolerated by all the
patients. All efforts were made to keep the BAL specimen
processing time as short as possible. BAL fluid samples were
frozen and stored at -35°C until analyzed, i.e., determinations
of ELF volume (VELF) and amikacin concentration.
After starting the first day 3 aerosol, blood was drawn to meas￾ure serum amikacin concentrations at 30 minutes, and 1, 3, 6,
9, 12 and 24 hours, and cumulative urine samples, 0 to 12 and
12 to 24 hours, were collected to determine amikacin excre￾tion via the kidneys. Serum creatinine levels were determined
daily in each center's laboratory, according to local practices.
Tracheal aspirates were collected on day 3 after the first aer￾osol and during the following 24 hours. Although tracheal suc￾tioning was routinely performed by the nurses, tracheal
aspirates collection was not compulsorily requested in the pro￾tocol and thus not performed in all patients: only 19 had tra￾cheal aspirates collection for amikacin concentration
determination. Moreover, because tracheal aspirates were col￾lected as part of routine care, they were collected at different
times for each patient. All samples were frozen and stored at -
35°C until analyzed.
Analytical measurements
The determination of amikacin concentrations in serum, tra￾cheal aspirates and BAL, and urea levels in serum and BAL
were performed by MEDTOX Laboratories (Saint Paul, MN,
USA). All methods were pre-validated according to current
Food and Drug Administration guidelines.
Determination of VELF recovered by BAL
As previously described [14,15], the VELF was evaluated using
urea as an endogenous marker of ELF dilution. Because urea
diffuses easily and rapidly throughout the body, ELF and
plasma urea concentrations are the same. In this setting,
knowing the urea concentration in plasma and the urea quan￾tity in a lavage sample enables VELF to be calculated, as fol￾lows: VELF = (BAL volume × (urea) in BAL)/(urea) in plasma,
where (urea) is the urea concentration. Once the recovered
VELF is known, then any acellular component concentration
(e.g., amikacin) can be calculated from it. The urea contents of
BAL fluid samples were determined using a commercially
available kit (Abbott Clinical Chemistry Urea Nitrogen Kit;
Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA), and subsequently
validated for analyzing urea in BAL. The urea content in corre￾sponding serum samples was determined using the same kit
without modification of the methodology as specified by the
manufacturer.
Determination of amikacin in serum
Serum samples drawn on day 3 were analyzed for amikacin
over a concentration range of 200 to 500 ng/mL using an high
performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(HPLC-MS)/MS-based methodology. This methodology was
used because commercial techniques for measuring amikacin
were not sensitive enough to measure the expected serum lev￾els in this study. Serum samples were mixed with internal
standard (tobramycin) and 800 μL of 2% trichloroacetic acid
and 200 μL of acetonitrile. Samples were then centrifuged and
filtered through C18 extraction cartridges. The sample effluent
was then analyzed using a 100 × 2.1 mm Betasil C18 column
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and a mobile phase
starting at 80% 1.5 mM heptafluorobutyric acid and 14%
methanol and 6% water. The mobile phase was changed step￾wise to a final composition of 80% methanol 20% water over
the course of two minutes.

Amikacin was monitored using the specific fragmentation
reactions produced under electronspray ionization - mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS)/MS conditions on an ABI-Sciex 5000
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystem,
Foster City, CA, USA). Amikacin was quantified by summing
the transitions 586.2>425.2, 586.2>163.1 and
586.2>264.2.
Furthermore, trough serum amikacin concentrations before
the morning nebulization were determined daily during the
treatment period. Dosages were performed at each center
using the kits available locally, with detection thresholds differ￾ing from one site to another. When the concentration was
below the detection threshold, the latter was arbitrarily given
as the value.
Determination of amikacin in BAL
The BAL amikacin concentration was analyzed using a com￾mercially available Syva® Emit® kit (Siemens Healthcare Diag￾nostics, Deerfield, IL, USA), designed for the analysis of
amikacin in human serum. The methodology was modified to
allow the analysis of amikacin in BAL over a concentration
range of 2.50 to 50.00 μg/mL by simply preparing assay cali￾brators and quality-control samples in BAL fluid; no further
modification of the assay procedure was required. This meth￾odology was validated by performing an analytical method val￾idation in full accordance to Food and Drug Administration
guidelines and current bioanalytical industry practice.
Pharmacokinetic analyses
The maximum serum amikacin concentration after the first
dose on day 3 was defined as Cmax, with the time to Cmax
defined as Tmax. The area under the serum amikacin concentra￾tion-time curve after the first dose (AUC0-12 hour) was calcu￾lated from the experimental data points obtained after the first
dose on day 3 (30 minutes, and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours) using
the trapezoidal method.
To determine amikacin absorption during the study period,
amikacin concentrations were measured in the two day 3 urine
collections, which reflected the quantity of each 12-hour dose
absorbed via inhalation.
Because day 3 tracheal aspirates were not collected at spe￾cific time points, the 24-hour collection time was divided into
four equivalent six-hour periods and then all results obtained
during the corresponding period were pooled. The first period
(H1 to H6) corresponds to the first six hours following the first
day 3 aerosol, the second (H7 to H12) to the next six hours
(before the second aerosol of the day), the third (H13 to H18)
to the six hours following the second day 3 nebulization, and
the fourth (H19 to H24) to the last six hours of the day, before
the next aerosol.
All results are expressed as medians (interquartile range
(IQR)), unless specified otherwise.
Results
The characteristics of the 30 patients included in this study are
reported in Table 1; 28 patients with VAP were included (no
patients with HAP or HCAP were included) in the pharmacok￾inetic study after the specimens from two patients were
excluded because these patients did not meet the requirement
of receiving at least three full days of study medication to be
included. All these 28 patients were on mechanical ventilation
at day 3 (both nebulization of day 3), either through an
endotracheal tube or a tracheotomy. Throughout the study, the
median (IQR) duration of nebulization was 36 (30 to 45) min￾utes for intubated patients on mechanical ventilation. Median
(IQR) duration of the 22 nebulizations for extubated patients
using the handheld device was 20 (20 to 25) minutes.
The median day 3 serum amikacin concentrations for the 28
patients are shown in Figure 2. Median (IQR) Cmax and Tmax
were 0.85 (0.67 to 1.01) μg/mL and 1.0 (1 to 3) hours,
respectively. AUC0-12 hour for amikacin was 6.15 (4.73 to 9.57)
μg.hr/mL. The median total amount of amikacin excreted in
urine during the first and second 12-hour specimens were 19
(12.21 to 28) and 21.2 (14.1 to 29.98) μg, respectively.
Fifteen to 30 minutes after the end of nebulization on day 3,
the median amikacin concentration in ELF was 976.07
(410.33 to 2563.12) μg/mL, with respective lower and upper
values of 135.67 and 16,127.56 μg/mL (Figure 3). Median
VELF was 0.46 (0.27 to 0.86) mL. No correlations could be
established between the ELF amikacin concentration and ven￾tilator settings (respiratory rate, peak inspiratory flow rate,
mode of ventilation), presence of acute respiratory distress
syndrome at the time of inclusion or ventilation duration. Tra￾cheal aspirates for amikacin concentration determinations
were collected on day 3 from 19 patients at 69 time points
(Figure 4). Median amikacin concentrations for the four six￾hour periods (H1 to H6, H7 to H12, H13 to H18 and H19 to
H24) were: 1517.5 (793 to 3430), 477 (100 to 1605.5),
1948 (288.25 to 6412.5) and 472 (241.5 to 1825.5) μg/mL,
respectively.
Patients were exposed to the study drug for a median of 7 (3
to 9) days. Figure 5 shows the trough serum amikacin concen￾trations during the study period. Values on day 1 (before any
nebulization) were not null because the limits of detection var￾ied from one center to another. Mean creatinine levels fluctu￾ated between 53 and 106 μmol/L with no apparent trend.
Among the 64 unexpected adverse events reported in our
study, one episode of worsening renal failure was possibly due
to nebulized amikacin. The patient, who developed septic
shock and was receiving many concomitant nephrotoxic med￾ications, developed acute renal failure requiring continuous

renal replacement therapy and aerosol discontinuation. The
investigator deemed this severe adverse event possibly attrib￾utable to nebulized amikacin. Another patient experienced an
episode of bronchospasm that resolved after discontinuing
the amikacin and nebulizing bronchodilators.
Discussion
In this study, we were able to demonstrate that amikacin, deliv￾ered by PDDS aerosolization, achieved high concentrations in
the lower respiratory tract, in zones corresponding to radio￾graphic infiltrate location, with low systemic absorption. More￾over, amikacin concentrations in ELF were more than 10-fold
higher than the MIC90 of microorganisms usually responsible
for nosocomial pneumonia (8 μg/mL for P. aeruginosa) [16];
and the observed amikacin concentrations exceeded the
MIC90 of Acinetobacter species by four-fold [17]. Thus, based
on this pharmacokinetic study, amikacin, nebulized via the
PDDS, could have particular relevance for patients with Gram￾negative VAP.
Aminoglycosides, combined with an antipseudomonal β￾lactam, were recently proposed as an initial empiric antimicro￾bial regimen for patients with late-onset VAP or risk factors for
multidrug-resistant pathogens [1]. But their lung penetration is
poor [2]. The results of two studies showed that ELF penetra￾tion of gentamicin and tobramycin after intravenous infusion
was poor, 12% and 32%, respectively, with peak concentra￾tions below 10-fold the MIC of pathogens usually responsible
for VAP [3,4].
Data on the bioavailability of aerosolized antibiotics in mechan￾ically ventilated patients are scarce. Goldstein and colleagues
found that amikacin nebulization, using an ultrasonic device,
achieved high tissue concentrations in piglets, far above the
MIC of most Gram-negative strains [5]. Those data were
obtained in mechanically ventilated piglets with healthy lungs,
but were confirmed in piglets with experimental Escherichia
coli pneumonia: after nebulization, amikacin concentrations in
lung tissue were 3 to 30-fold higher than after intravenous

administration and were associated with a lower lung bacterial
burden [18]. In humans, Le Conte and colleagues observed
that a single tobramycin aerosolization delivered to patients
with healthy lungs achieved high lung concentrations and low
serum concentrations [19]. The same authors performed a
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
evaluating aerosolized tobramycin for patients with bacterial￾proven VAP. They included 38 patients, among whom 21
received tobramycin and 17 a placebo, and showed that aer￾osols were well-tolerated. As all patients received, in addition
to aerosols, intravenous tobramycin, the authors could draw
no conclusions as to the efficacy or pharmacokinetics of the
aerosol administration [20].
In an observational study conducted 10 years ago [21],
Palmer and colleagues treated six patients, colonized with

multidrug-resistant bacteria, with aerosolized gentamicin or
amikacin. They showed that this antibiotic delivery route
decreased the volume of tracheal secretions and bacterial bur￾den in the tracheal aspirates. In their study, tracheal aminogly￾coside concentrations were very high, without high systemic
absorption in patients with normal renal function [21].
Only a few pharmacokinetic data are available on nebulization
with vibrating mesh nebulizers. One study, conducted on six
healthy volunteers receiving non-invasive pressure-support
ventilation through a mouthpiece, used the Aeroneb® Pro with
a spacer. Amikacin was nebulized (40, 50 and 60 mg/kg). The
authors showed that nebulizing up to 60 mg/kg of amikacin
was safe and well-tolerated, with absorption estimated at 10
to 13% of the nebulizer load. However, those data were
obtained in healthy volunteers and with non-invasive ventilation
[22]. Two studies compared drug delivery with a vibrating
mesh versus an ultrasonic nebulizer: delivering either tobramy￾cin in vitro [23] or ceftazidime in an animal model [8]. Neither
study found any difference in the amount of drug delivered,
regardless of the type of nebulizer used. However, the Aer￾oneb® Pro nebulizer, which is not breath-synchronized, was
used in those studies and it can be thought that the amount of
drug delivered to the lung would probably be higher using a
breath-synchronized device [9].
Our findings are in accordance with a preliminary study, per￾formed within the framework of a double-blind, placebo-con￾trolled study of PDDS-delivered aerosolized amikacin in
ventilated patients with Gram-negative VAP [24]. In that study,
eight patients receiving aerosolized amikacin underwent two
BAL: one in an infection-involved zone and the other in a radi￾ologically normal zone. All patients had high amikacin concen￾trations in the tracheal tree, but also in ELF, even in poorly
aerated zones [24].
One of the key problems with using aminoglycosides is their
toxicity. In animals with healthy lungs, daily amikacin nebuliza￾tion was not associated with tissue or systemic accumulation
[25]. The same results were obtained in humans with healthy
or infected lungs [19-21]. Our results showed that, despite
high antibiotic levels in ELF and little systemic absorption,
trough serum amikacin concentrations remained below the
renal toxicity threshold [26]. Nevertheless, one patient experi￾enced an episode of worsening acute renal failure that the
investigator considered possibly related to the study medica￾tion.
The 400 mg dose was chosen based on a previous double￾blind, placebo-controlled study of PDDS delivery of aero￾solized amikacin to ventilated patients with Gram-negative
VAP [27]. That study compared three regimens of two daily
aerosolizations administered for 7 to 14 days: two regimens of
nebulized amikacin (400 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily
and placebo), and placebo nebulized twice daily. The results
showed that the 400 mg dose once or twice daily was suffi￾cient to obtain high amikacin concentrations in tracheal aspi￾rates (>25 μg/mL, the reference MIC for hospital-acquired
organisms) with low trough serum concentrations, even in
patients receiving amikacin twice daily, thereby avoiding renal
toxicity [27]. In that study, patients given 400 mg of amikacin
twice daily received less systemic antibiotics than patients
receiving 400 mg once daily or placebo [12]. Moreover, a sub￾group analysis showed that day 3 amikacin concentrations in
alveolar ELF were very high [24].
Our study has several limitations. First, because all patients
had normal renal function (a prerequisite for inclusion in the
study), we cannot extrapolate our conclusions to patients with
renal insufficiency or failure, which is frequent in intensive care
patients with VAP. Although the diffusion into ELF might be the
same, it is likely that the blood concentration would have been
higher. Second, using urea as a marker of dilution could have
underestimated the real concentration. Indeed, urea can leak
into the air spaces during the BAL procedure, leading to over￾estimation of its concentration in BAL fluids and hence VELF.
Overestimating VELF would have led to underestimation of ami￾kacin concentrations in ELF. On the other hand, because of
possible bronchial backflow during BAL collection, BAL fluids
might have been contaminated by tracheal secretions, whose
amikacin concentrations are very high, and that would have
overestimated the concentrations [27]. Finally, amikacin con￾centrations varied widely among patients. This variability is
probably due to multiple factors, including aeration, ventilator
settings, ventilatory circuit and patient's specific factors.
These factors may deserve to be evaluated in a specifically
designed study. However, variability due to poor nebulization
reproducibility cannot be excluded. But, the ELF amikacin con￾Figure 5

centrations always exceeded the MIC of microorganisms
responsible for VAP; hence, these variations probably have no
clinical implications.
Conclusions
Amikacin aerosolization with the PDDS vibrating mesh neb￾ulizer achieved high concentrations in ELF with little systemic
absorption and accumulation, thereby confirming recent data
obtained in healthy volunteers [22]. The clinical efficacy of
adjunctive aerosol therapy remains to be determined.
