Effects of ileal resection on biliary lipids and bile acid
composition in patients with Crohn's disease
A Lapidus, K Einarsson
Abstract
Biliary lipid composition, cholesterol satura￾tion, and bile acid pattern were determined in
fasting duodenal bile of 10 patients (four men
and six women, mean age 41 years) with
Crohn's disease and a history of ileal resection
(mean 64 cm). The data were compared with
corresponding values in a group of healthy
subjects. None of the patients with Crohn's
disease had supersaturated bile. Cholesterol
saturation was significantly lower in the
patients with Crohn's disease than in the
healthy subjects. The molar percentage of
cholesterol was also lower among the patients
but there was no significant difference. The
molar percentages of phospholipids and bile
acids were normal. Bile acid composition in
the patients with ileal resection was charac￾terised by a signficant decrease in the deoxy￾cholic acid fraction and a pronounced increase
in the ursodeoxycholic acid fraction compared
with the healthy subjects. The surprisingly
high percentage of ursodeoxycholic acid may
contribute to the low degree of cholesterol
saturation in bile. Based on these results
patients with Crohn's disease should not have
an increased risk of cholesterol gail stone
formation.

Bile acids are formed in the liver from cholesterol.
They are excreted in bile and participate in the
enterohepatic circulation as primary bile acids
(chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid) and secon￾dary bile acids (deoxycholic acid, lithocholic
acid, ursodeoxycholic acid).'2 About 95-99% of
bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestine. This
occurs mainly by an active process in the distal
part of the ileum and to a less extent by passive
diffusion along the whole intestine.
Ileal resection leads to bile acid malabsorption
and altered lipid composition.34 This might
result in 'bile acid deficiency' in the enterohepatic
circulation and consequently a relative excess of
cholesterol and cholesterol supersaturated bile.'

posed as an important factor in cholesterol gall
stone formation.6 Since there is an increased
prevalence of gall stones among patients with
Crohn's disease, particularly those with a history
ofileal resection, such patients might be expected
to have a high degree of cholesterol saturation.7"'
The aim of this study was to determine lipid
composition, bile acid composition, and choles￾terol saturation in patients with Crohn's disease
who had previously undergone ileal resection of
various lengths to evaluate whether they have an
increased risk of developing cholesterol gall
stones.
Methods
PATIENTS
Ten patients (four men and six women; mean age
41 years) with a history of ileal resection due to
Crohn's disease were included in the study
(Table I). The length of resected ileum varied
from 20 to 160 cm with an average of 64 cm.
None had clinical or laboratory evidence of
active disease. All were of normal weight and
normolipidaemic. None had a history of gall
stone disease. All had normal liver and renal
function tests. One patient was treated with
sulphasalazine while the other patients took no
drugs that are known to interfere with lipid or
bile acid metabolism.
Informed consent to participate was obtained
from each patient. The ethical aspects of the
study were approved by the Ethical Committee
at Huddinge University Hospital.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
The patients were hospitalised for the study and
fed the regular hospital diet containing about
0 5 mmol cholesterol per day. Bile was collected
on the two following days. An oroduodenal tube
was introduced in the morning after an overnight
fast. Gall bladder contraction was stimulated by
intravenous injection of cholecystokinin, and
5 ml of concentrated gall bladder bile was
obtained through the tube. The tube was
removed and the same procedure repeated the
following day.
The lipid composition (cholesterol, phospho￾lipids, and bile acids) and bile acid composition
of bile were determined. The cholesterol satura￾tion was calculated. The results were compared
to corresponding data in a large group of healthy
subjects previously reported."

Effects ofileal resection on biliary lipids and bile acid composition in patients with Crohn's disease
lipids a portion of the duodenal bile was im￾mediately extracted with 20 volumes of chloro￾form-methanol 2:1 (vol/vol). Cholesterol was
determined by an enzymatic method'2 and phos￾pholipids by the method of Rouser et al.'3 The
total bile acid concentration was determined
using a 3-ct-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
assay. 14 Cholesterol saturation was calculated
according to Carey's method with the total lipid
concentration assumed to be 10 g/100 ml in
concentrated fasting duodenal bile. '` Cholesterol
saturation was also calculated with a correction
factor for ursodeoxycholic acid rich bile.'5
BILIARY BILE ACID COMPOSITION
The duodenal bile samples were hydrolysed with
1 mol/l potassium hydroxide in closed steel tubes
for 12 hours at 1 10°C. The deconjugated bile
acids were extracted with ethyl ether after acidi￾fication with 6 mol/l HCI to pH 1. An aliquot of
the deconjugated bile acids was methylated,
trimethylsilylated, and analysed by gas-liquid
chromatography using a 1% HiEff BP8 column
as described previously. 16
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data are presented as mean (SEM). Compari￾sons ofdata between patients and healthy subjects
were calculated by using Student's t test. Prob￾ability values <0 05 were considered to be
significant.
Results
Data for biliary lipid composition and cholesterol
saturation are given in Table II. The molar
percentage of cholesterol was lower, but not
significantly lower, in the patients with ileal
resection than in the healthy control subjects
(4.6 molar % v 5.6 molar % p<0 1). There were
no significant differences in the molar percen￾tages of phospholipids or bile acids between the
patients and the healthy subjects.
Cholesterol saturation was significantly lower
in the patients than in the control subjects (64% v
86%, p<0 005). None of the 10 patients had
supersaturated bile. As cholesterol saturation of
bile increases with age," we related the data for
our patients to the data for control subjects of
corresponding age. As the Figure shows, in all
but one patient cholesterol saturation of bile was
below normal.
Biliary bile acid composition differed between
the patients and the control subjects (Table III).
Thus the percentage of deoxycholic acid was
significantly lower in the patients than in the
control subjects (12.7% v 23.4% p<0 05). Sur￾prisingly, the amount of ursodeoxycholic acid
was significantly higher in the patients than in
the control subjects (103% v 0.7% p<0.001).
There were no correlations between the length

Crohn's disease have a low molar percentage of
cholesterol and low cholesterol saturation of bile.
No correlation between cholesterol saturation
and length of resected ileum was found. Various
data on bile lithogenicity in patients with
Crohn's disease have been published. Most
studies have reported on a high frequency of
cholesterol supersaturated bile in Crohn's
disease patients with ileal resection or ileal
dysfunction.5 7-'9 Only Farkkila has reported
that patients who had undergone ileal resection
had low to normal cholesterol saturation of bile."0
Farkkila found that the molar percentage of
biliary cholesterol was inversely correlated with
faecal bile acid excretion in patients with ileal
resection and suggested that biliary cholesterol
secretion decreases with increasing loss of bile

acids to faeces, leading to hyposaturation of
cholesterol in bile.
Bile acid composition in our patients with ileal
resection was characterised by
a significant
decrease in the deoxycholic acid fraction and
a
surprisingly high percentage of ursodeoxycholic
acid. There were no significant differences
between the patients and healthy control subjects
for cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and litho￾cholic acid. The decreased molar percentage of
deoxycholic acid is in agreement with the results
of several studies,4 18 192123 but not with all.'7 2425
Low deoxycholic acid concentrations may be due
to impaired formation or conservation, or both.
Probably the decrease in deoxycholic acid in
patients with ileal resection is caused by reduced
exposure of cholic acid to bacterial
7 a-de￾hydroxylase because of a shortened intestinal
transit time. This is further supported by pre￾vious studies on the faecal pattern of bile acids in
patients with Crohn's disease showing
a pro￾nounced low relative proportion of deoxycholic
acid and an increased proportion of cholic
acid.23 26
Ursodeoxycholic acid is the
7 j-hydroxye￾pimer of chenodeoxycholic acid and is usually
found only in small concentrations in human
bile.2728 Previous studies in healthy subjects and
in patients with Crohn's disease have shown that
ursodeoxycholic acid is formed from cheno￾deoxycholic acid via 7-ketolithocholic acid as an
intermediate.293' Chenodeoxycholic acid is
oxidised to 7-ketolithocholic acid by bacterial
enzymes in the intestine. In the liver most of the
7-ketolithocholic acid is reduced to chenodeoxy￾cholic acid and only a little to ursodeoxycholic
acid. Some chenodeoxycholic acid may also be
transformed to ursodeoxycholic acid in the intes￾tine.32 A slightly increased amount of ursodeoxy￾cholic acid in unoperated patients with Crohn's
disease has been reported by Rutgeerts and
colleagues2533 and Nishida et al.34 However, in
contrast to our results Rutgeerts et al'8 19 found
a
normal concentration of ursodeoxycholic acid in
patients with ileal resection. The present find￾ings of a more than tenfold increase in the
relative concentration of ursodeoxycholic acid
and
a concomitant decrease in deoxycholic acid
in patients with Crohn's disease and ileal resec￾tion are not quite understood. One explanation
may be that such patients may have an abnormal
intestinal flora that favours the formation of
ursodeoxycholic acid.
Treatment of patients with gall stones with
ursodeoxycholic acid is associated with unsatura￾tion of bile and may induce stone dissolution.2835
The cholesterol desaturating effect of ursode￾oxycholic acid is due to a decreased output of
biliary cholesterol,36 which in turn is mainly
explained by impaired absorption of cholesterol
from the intestine.3739 Ursodeoxycholic acid may
also prolong the nucleation time of gall bladder
bile,404' thereby preventing cholesterol crystal￾lisation and gall stone formation. We suggest
that the increased proportion of ursodeoxycholic
acid in combination with
a decreased proportion
of deoxycholic acid in the bile of the patients with
Crohn's disease in the present study may have
contributed to their low cholesterol saturation.
Our results show that there should be no
increased risk of cholesterol gall stone formation
in patients with Crohn's disease who have under￾gone ileal resection. On the other hand, in
several studies an increased prevalence of gall
stones among patients with ileal dysfunction has
been found.7"'0 How can we explain that? It may
be that patients with ileal resection preferentially
form pigment stones. It has been reported from
studies in the prairie dog and guinea pig that ileal
resection produces gall stones of pigment
type.42 43
Patients with Crohn's disease who have under￾gone ileal resection have low choltsterol satura￾tion of bile to which an increased amount of
ursodeoxycholic acid may contribute. Such
patients should therefore not run an increased
risk of cholesterol gall stone formation.
