We report on a probable interaction between ticlopidine
250 mg once daily and cyclosporin A leading to a decrease
in the trough concentration dose ratio—that is, concentra￾tion divided by daily dose per kilogram—of cyclosporin A.
A 64 year old woman had a stable renal graft. She was
given ticlopidine 250 mg once daily owing to a left third
cranial nerve palsy of new onset probably caused by
ischaemia. Relevant medical history after the transplant
included diabetes mellitus and angina precipitated by
supraventricular tachycardia. The patient was taking fruse￾mide (furosemide), digoxin, insulin, prednisone, azathio￾prine, and cyclosporin A throughout follow up. The
patient was given pravastatin from 1132 to 1279 days after
transplantation.
The dose of cyclosporin A was changed several times
during the three year follow up (range 2.81-4.39 mg/kg
daily). We therefore report the results as the concentration
dose ratio, which gives an approximation of the clearance
and bioavailability of the drug.
Monitoring of cyclosporin A concentration in whole
blood by an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique
(EMIT 200, Behring Diagnostics, Cupertino, CA) showed a
decrease in concentration dose ratio after ticlopidine was
introduced. The median concentration dose ratios were 36
before and 25 after treatment with ticlopidine. The patient
agreed to stop taking ticlopidine for three months, and
aspirin 200 mg/day was simultaneously added to the treat￾ment. The median concentration dose ratios were 38 and
26 after the discontinuation and reintroduction of ticlo￾pidine (figure). No signs of graft rejection were observed.
We considered ticlopidine to be responsible for the
observed changes because of both the observed temporal
sequence, including the effects of reintroduction and with￾drawal of ticlopidine, and the history of an interaction with
ticlopidine 500 mg daily.1 2
The only previous published report evaluating the
potential interactions between ticlopidine and cyclosporin
A, with half standard doses of ticlopidine for 14 days in 20
recipients of heart transplants, failed to show clear
evidence of any pharmacokinetic modification.3 We found
that ticlopidine 250 mg once daily decreased the blood
concentration of cyclosporin A in this patient, and we
would therefore recommend close monitoring of such
blood concentrations when introducing or withdrawing
ticlopidine in patients taking cyclosporin A.

Lithium toxicity after urinary diversion with ileal
conduit

A 71 year old woman underwent urinary diversion with ileal
conduits for severe stress incontinence that had been
refractory to previous treatments. She had longstanding
bipolar affective disorder that was well controlled with
lithium carbonate 600 mg daily. The lithium was discontin￾ued preoperatively and recommenced at the original dose
48 hours postoperatively. Ten days later, after removal of the
ureteric stents, she developed progressive confusion, dysar￾thria, nausea, and ataxia; her serum lithium concentration
was increased at 2.1 mmol/l (treatment range 0.4-1.0
mmol/l). Lithium was discontinued and she made a full
recovery with intravenous hydration alone. Subsequent
dose titration required a reduction of lithium to 200 mg
daily. This observation has been reported to the Committee
on Safety of Medicines and the drug’s manufacturer.
Metabolic complications (mainly hyperchloraemia and
hypokalaemia) are well recognised after urinary diversion
but infrequently require specific treatment.1 Problems
arising from drug reabsorption are rare but have been
reported for phenytoin and methotrexate.2 3 Lithium has a
narrow treatment ratio, with toxicity occurring at only twice
the upper limit of the treatment range. Steady serum
concentrations occur as early as 2-5 days after starting treat￾ment.4 About 95% of lithium is eliminated unchanged in
urine, and it is readily absorbed by enteral mucosa.
The delayed toxicity in this patient was probably
related to the ureteric stents: on their removal all urine
drained through the ileal conduit, resulting in reabsorp￾tion of lithium. We advise that such patients are discharged
only after stable serum lithium concentrations are
re-established after stent removal. Additionally, owing to
the long term changes associated with urinary diversion,5
continued vigilance is essential.
Any surgery resulting in exposure of bowel to urine
should be taken into account when considering and
monitoring pharmacotherapy, particularly of drugs
excreted in a bioavailable form.
