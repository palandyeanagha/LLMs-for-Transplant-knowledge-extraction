Abstract
Background: Muscle wasting and decreased muscle oxidative
capacity commonly occur in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
have been shown to mediate several inflammatory and metabolic
pathways which may be involved in the pathogenesis of muscle
impairment in COPD. The aim of this study was to investigate the
effect of PUFA modulation on systemic inflammation, reversal of
muscle wasting, and functional status in COPD.
Methods: Eighty patients with COPD (57 men) with forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 37.3 (13.8)% predicted
received 9 g PUFA or placebo daily in a double blind randomised
fashion during an 8 week rehabilitation programme. Body
composition (bioelectrical impedance), functional capacity (lung
function, incremental cycle ergometry test, submaximal cycle test,
isokinetic quadriceps strength) and inflammatory markers (C-
reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α) were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks.
Results: Both groups had similar increases in weight, fat-free mass
(FFM), and muscle strength. The peak load of the incremental
exercise test increased more in the PUFA group than in the placebo
group (difference in increase 9.7 W (95% CI 2.5 to 17.0), p = 0.009)
even after adjustment for FFM. The duration of the constant work
rate test also increased more in patients receiving PUFA (difference
in increase 4.3 min (95% CI 0.6 to 7.9), p = 0.023). The positive
effects of PUFA could not be attributed to a decrease in systemic
levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α.
Conclusions: This is the first study to show beneficial effects of
PUFA on exercise capacity in patients with COPD.
