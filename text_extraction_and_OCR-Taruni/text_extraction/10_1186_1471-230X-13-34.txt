Abstract
Background: Epidemiologic studies have reported inconsistent results regarding coffee consumption and the risk
of liver cancer. We performed a meta-analysis of published case–control and cohort studies to investigate the
association between coffee consumption and liver cancer.
Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science and the Cochrane library for studies published up to
May 2012. We performed a meta-analysis of nine case–control studies and seven cohort studies.
Results: The summary odds ratio (OR) for high vs no/almost never drinkers was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI):
0.42–0.59), with no significant heterogeneity across studies (Q = 16.71; P = 0.337; I2 = 10.2%). The ORs were 0.50
(95% CI: 0.40–0.63) for case–control studies and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.38–0.62) for cohort studies. The OR was 0.38 (95% CI:
0.25–0.56) in males and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.33–1.10) in females. The OR was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.36–0.56) in Asian studies and
0.57 (95% CI: 0.44–0.75) in European studies. The OR was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.28–0.54) with no adjustment for a history
of liver disease and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.46–0.66) after adjustment for a history of liver disease.
Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis suggested an inverse association between coffee consumption and
liver cancer. Because of the small number of studies, further prospective studies are needed.

Background
Primary liver cancer is a common malignancy worldwide.
It is the fifth most common cancer in men and the cause
of a third of male cancer deaths. It is the eighth most
common cancer in women and the sixth most common
cause of female cancer deaths [1]. Chronic infection with
hepatitis B or C viruses and alcohol consumption are
considered the most important risk factors for liver cancer
[2-5]. A large number of epidemiological studies indicated
that environmental factors can affect the risk of liver can￾cer, but the role of dietary factors in tumorigenesis has not
yet been determined [6-8]. Analysis of environmental
factors that may be associated with liver cancer has be￾come a popular research topic in recent years.
Coffee contains many biologically active components,
some of which may have anti-tumor effects. Epidemio￾logical studies have reported inconsistent findings on the
association between coffee and liver cancer. We therefore
carried out a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies
and case–control studies in order to clarify the association
between coffee consumption and liver cancer.
Methods
Search strategy
We searched Medline (via PubMed; National Library of
Medicine), EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the
Netherlands), ISI Web of Science (Institute for Scientific
Information, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and the Cochrane
library (Wiley, Chichester, United Kingdom) for studies
published up to May 2012. Key words searched were as
follows: (coffee OR caffeine OR beverages OR diet OR
drinking OR lifestyle) AND (liver OR hepatocellular OR
digestive) AND (cancer OR carcinoma OR tumor OR neo￾plasm) AND (risk). No language restrictions were applied.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were: case–control or cohort study;
data on the frequency of coffee consumption; primary

sample size, type of outcome, consumption of coffee,
number of exposed cases, the RRs or ORs or HRs and
their 95%CIs, and covariates adjusted in the analysis. All
data were extracted independently by three reviewers,
and any disagreement was resolved by discussion bet￾ween them. If results were published more than once,
the results from the most recent one were selected. Be￾cause liver cancer is rare, the OR was assumed to be the
same as RR and HR, and all results are reported as OR
for simplicity [9].
Quality assessment
The study quality was assessed by the 9-star Newcastle￾Ottawa Scale [10]. A full score is 9 stars, and a score ≥ 6
stars is considered to be high quality. The quality of
case–control studies was assessed as follows: adequate
definition of cases, representativeness of cases, selection
of controls, definition of controls, control for the most
important factor or the second important factor, expo￾sure assessment, same method of ascertainment for all
subjects, and non-response rate (Table 1). The quality of
cohort studies was assessed as follows: representative￾ness of the exposed cohort, selection of the unexposed
cohort, ascertainment of exposure, outcome of interest
not present at start of study, control for the most im￾portant factor or the second important factor, outcome
assessment, follow-up long enough for outcomes to
occur, adequacy of follow-up of cohorts (Table 2).
Statistical analysis
For the included studies, we determined pooled ORs
(or RRs or HRs) with 95% CI for the highest versus
lowest category of coffee consumption from each study.
Since various sources of heterogeneity may exist owing

to a variety of factors, we carried out subgroup analysis to
investigate the influence of study design, study re￾gion, sex and history of liver disease on the
heterogeneity.
Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated through the
Q test and I2 statistic [26]; P < 0.10 was considered
statistically significant [27]. If the heterogeneity was accep￾table (I2 < 50%), a fixed effects analysis was conducted to
calculate the pooled OR. In addition, a random effects
model was used. The causes of heterogeneity were
investigated by subgroup analyses. To evaluate whether
publication bias might affect the statistical results, we ap￾plied Egger’s test and Begg’s method to assess bias
through visual inspection of funnel plots [28,29]; all sta￾tistical analyses were conducted using STATA (version
11.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). All statis￾tical tests were 2-sided.
Results
Study characteristics
Figure 1 shows the process of selecting studies for the
meta-analysis. Sixteen observational articles examining
the association between coffee consumption and the risk
of liver cancer were included in our meta-analysis
(Table 3) [11-25]. There were nine case–control studies
[11-19] and seven cohort studies (two of these were
nested in a cohort article) [20-25]. Of the selected
studies, 11 were conducted in Asia (nine in Japan
[14,15,17,18,20-22,24], one in Singapore [25], one in
Hong Kong [19]) and five in Europe (one in Finland [23],
two in Italy [13,16], one in Greece [11], one in Italy and
Greece [12]). Among case–control studies, seven were
hospital-based case–control studies [11-16,19], and two
were nested case- control studies [17,18].
High vs Non/Almost never drinkers
A meta-analysis of risk estimates for the incidence of
liver cancer for highest compared with lowest coffee
consumption categories could be conducted with data
from nine case–control studies and nine cohort studies.
Our results showed a 50% reduction in risk of liver can￾cer with the highest intake of coffee (summary OR: 0.50,
95%CI: 0.42–0.59) (Figure 2). There was no significant
heterogeneity across studies (Q = 16.71, P = 0.337, I2 =
10.2%). There was a symmetric funnel plot and no evi￾dence of significant publication bias from Egger’s test
(P = 0.05) and Begg’s test (P = 0.096) (Figure 3).
A sensitivity analysis for the risk of liver cancer was
performed by excluding one study [22], the outcome of
which was mortality. The summary OR was 0.49 (95%
CI: 0.41–0.59). There was no significant heterogeneity
across studies (Q = 16.7, P = 0.272, I2 = 16.2%).
Similar results were found in a subgroup analyses
conducted by study design in case–control studies
(OR: 0.50, 95%CI: 0.40–0.63, Q = 12.38, P = 0.125, I2 =
36.8%), and cohort studies (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.38–0.62,
Q = 2.47, P = 0.676, I2 = 0.0%) (Figure 4).
In a subgroup analysis conducted by sex, only four
studies were included in the analysis: studies in
males gave an OR of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.25–0.56, Q =
1.83, P = 0.609, I2 = 0.0%), while studies in females gave
an OR of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.33–1.10, Q = 0.94, P = 0.815,
I

Discussion
Coffee consumption has been suggested as a protective
factor in the development of liver cancer, but evidence
from observational studies is inconsistent [11-25]. The
results of the current meta-analysis of seven prospective
and nine case–control studies suggest that there is an
inverse association between coffee consumption and liver
cancer among different groups according to consumption
level. There were significant reductions of 50% in the risk
of liver cancer with the highest consumption of coffee
compared with non/almost never consumption. The meta￾analyses of Bravi et al. [30] found significant reductions of
55% in the risk of liver cancer with the high drinkers
compared with non-drinkers, and Larsson & wolk [31]
found a risk reduction of 43% per 2 cups of coffee per day
increment. Our results are consistent with these two previ￾ous articles, partly because all of the studies in these two
articles are included in the our meta-analysis.
Some results in this meta-analysis were heteroge￾neous, because the included studies had differences in
study design, study region, study sex distribution, and

control for confounding factors. In separate analyses
by study design, we found an inverse association be￾tween coffee consumption and liver cancer among
hospital- based case–control studies and among co￾hort studies.
There was also an inverse association between coffee
consumption and liver cancer among European and
Asian populations, and the significant risk reduction was
stronger among Asian than European populations. The
different results may be explained by racial differences.
Differences in coffee drinking habits may be a partial ex￾planation for the discrepancy.
We also found an inverse association between coffee
consumption and liver cancer among male and female
populations, but this result was derived from only four
studies with a small number of cases, so we could not
draw a firm conclusion. A history of liver disease may be
a risk factor for liver cancer, and after adjustment for this,
a significant inverse association remained between coffee
consumption and liver cancer among two subgroups.
There are several potential mechanisms through which
high consumption of coffee may reduce the risk of liver
cancer. Coffee contains a variety of chemicals including
caffeine, cafestol, kahweol, and chlorogenic acids. It
remains uncertain which ingredient of coffee is protective
against liver cancer. Some studies have indicated that
caffeine can prevent oxidative DNA damage, modify the
apoptotic response and reverse cell cycle checkpoint
function [32-34]. Caffeine has strong antioxidant pro￾perties [35]. In an animal experiment, caffeine signifi￾cantly reduced the incidence of chemically-induced
hepatocellular carcinoma in rats [36]. Furthermore,
cafestol and kahweol have been shown to be anti￾carcinogenic [37,38]. Cafestol and kahweol have
demonstrated a protective effect against aflatoxin B1-
induced genotoxicity [39]. In addition, a study by Feng
et al. showed that chlorogenic acids can scavenge reac￾tive oxygen species and have an anti-tumor effect [40].
These studies suggest that ingredients in coffee may
play an important role in protecting against the occur￾rence and development of liver cancer.
Our meta-analysis had some merits. First, the total
number of cases included in this meta-analysis was
substantial (n = 3622 liver cancer cases). The sum￾mary ORs of the highest compared with the lowest
coffee consumption categories for risk of liver cancer
were consistent with those in a previously published
meta-analyses (n = 2260 liver cancer cases) [30,31].
Second, we found little evidence of publication bias
in our meta-analysis. Third, we performed a compre￾hensive search of the literature on the association be￾tween coffee consumption and liver cancer risk up to
May 2012.
Our meta-analysis had several limitations. First, we
used the highest and lowest coffee consumption levels as
measures of exposure, but we were not able to deter￾mine whether different amounts of coffee consumption
could decrease liver cancer risk. Second, misclassifica￾tion bias should be considered. Each study presented
coffee consumption in different units (cups/week, cups/
day, days/week, drinks/day, times/week). Therefore,
differential misclassification could bias the results.

Third, because liver cancer is a multifactorial disease,
it is uncertain whether other factors may have in￾fluenced the results. Fourth, the study areas covered
in our meta-analysis only included Asia (Japan, China,
Hong Kong) and Europe (Finland, Greece, Italy).
Therefore, the value of our results is limited for other
areas (Africa, America and Australia). Fifth, potential
publication bias might have influenced the results,
despite no bias indicated from either the funnel plot
or Egger’s test.
Conclusion
The results of this meta-analysis suggested that coffee
consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of
liver cancer. However, because of potential confounding,
this finding should be treated with caution. Further better￾controlled studies are needed to confirm this finding.
