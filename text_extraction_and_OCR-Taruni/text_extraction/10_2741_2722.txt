1. ABSTRACT 
The current treatment of neuroendocrine tumors 
include the use of somatostatin (SST) agonists. These 
compounds are able to control most of the symptoms 
caused by the hypersecretory activity of the tumor cells, 
and for this reason, they provide a significant improvement 
in the well-being of the patients. Although, several 
reports also showed a possible direct antiproliferative 
activity of SST agonists in different neuroendocrine 
tumors, the therapeutic potential of an in vivo
antiproliferative activity mediated by SST receptors is 
still debated. In recent years, there has been great 
insights on understaning the molecular basis of the 
antitumoral activity of SST that appears to be exerted 
via both direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct 
mechanisms require the activation of SST receptors in 
tumor cells and the induction of cell cycle arrest or 
apoptosis, mainly through the regulation of 
phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and MAP kinase 
activities. The indirect mechanisms involve the 
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and the inhibition of 
the secretion of factors which are required for tumor 
growth. Here, we will review the molecular mechanisms 
which are implicated in the antiproliferaitve activity of 
SST. Such an understanding is necessary for improving 
the antitumoral efficacy of SSTR agonists as well as for 
the development of novel therapeutic strategies. 
2. INTRODUCTION 
Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of 
neoplasms derived from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. 
The definition of neuroendocrine was originally proposed 
in light of the similarity between these cells and neurons, 
although it is now clear that only few of the neuroendocrine 
cells are neuroetodermic in origin (for example the adrenal 
medulla and the paraganglia cells)(1). Independently from 
the embryologic origin, the definition of neuroendocrine 
cell has to meet the following requirements: i) the secretory 
activity of a neurotransmitter or a neuropeptide hormone; 
ii) the presence of dense core secretory granules that are 
exocytosed in response to extracellular stimuli; iii) the 
absence of neurites and synapses, as a morphological 
discrimination with neurons; iv) the expression of 
chromogranin A, that represent one of the most useful 
molecular marker of neuroendocrine cells (2). 
Being derived form such a wide spectrum of 
different cell population, neuroendocrine tumors are 
necessarily heterogeneous as far as localization, hormonal 
secretory pattern, clinical and prognostic features. 
Neuroendocrine tumors include carcinoids, non-carcinoids 
gastro-entero-pancreatic tumors such as insulinomas, 
gastrinomas and VIPomas, pheochromocytomas, 
paragangliomas, ganglioneuromas, neuroblastomas and 
other catecholamine-secreting tumors, medullary thyroid 

Regulation of cell proliferation by somatostatin receptors

carcinomas, chromophobe pituitary adenomas, small cell 
lung cancers, etc. (2). 
The incidence of these tumors is increased in the 
last years, accounting for about the 1% of all human 
tumors. The gastrointestinal localization accounts for more 
than 70% of all the neuroendocrine tumors. Clinically, 
beside the proliferative and invasive behaviours that may 
vary among the different tumor localizations, 
neuroendocrine tumors are characterized by hypersecretion 
of peptide hormones or catecholamines that, ultimately, are 
responsible of the characteristic syndromes of each tumor 
histotype. For example, patients with insulinomas will 
display severe hypoglicemia crisis while, in the case of 
carcinoids or VIPomas, watery diarrhoea, hypokaliemia 
and achlorhydria are observed, due to the hyperincretion of 
serotonin or VIP (3-5). Different therapeutic approaches 
have been used for these kind of tumors, although in most 
cases, non curative, including surgery, cytotoxic drug 
treatment (streptozotocin, dacarbazine adriamycin and 5-
fluorouracil) that represent a common way of management 
mainly for the pancreatic tumors (6), and hepatic artery 
embolization or chemoembolization for the treatment of 
liver metastases (7). 
The therapeutic protocol of neuroendocrine 
tumors considers also the use of long-acting somatostatin 
(SST) analogues, mainly octreotide and lanreotide, to take 
advantage of the powerful antihormonal activity of 
somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) to induce the palliation of 
syndromes related to the tumor-dependent hormone 
hypersecretion (8). In fact, in a large series of 
neuroendocrine tumors a high prevalence of SSTRs was 
observed in both primary tumors and metastases, showing a 
continuous expression even after long term treatment (9). 
In particular, although differences according to the tumor 
histotype were observed as far as frequency and amount, 
neuroendocrine tumors express all the SSTR subtypes 
(SSTR1-5) (10-12). 
Presently, the responses to SSTR analogues in the 
therapy of neuroendocrine tumors can be defined according 
to three categories: a) symptomatic, b) biochemical and c) 
objective. 
a) Symptomatic responses represent the reduction 
of the symptoms related to the hypersecretion in the 
functional neuroendocrine tumors and the inhibition of the 
tumor bulk-related symptoms, such as upper abdominal 
pain, causing an improvement of the quality of life and 
performance status in patients with non functional 
neuroendocrine tumors. The reported efficacy of the 
treatment with SST analogues may reach 50-70% of the 
treated patients (13-16). 
b) Biochemical responses are defined as a 
reduction larger than 50% in the serum or urine levels of 
tumor markers. In particular although the relevance of this 
parameter is still debated, a marked early decrease in 
markers level can be considered of prognostic value for the 
therapy con SST analogues. 
c) Although there are still contradictory reports, 
some studies observed that SST analogues (octreotide and 
lanreotide) may possess also a direct antiproliferative 
activity in neuroendocrine tumors. In fact, a temporary 
stabilization of gastroenteropancreatic tumor growth (from 
a minimum of 3 months to 5 years) was observed in 30-
70% of the patients treated with SST analogues and a 
partial response in less than 10% of the cases (5, 15, 17-
21). Furthermore, few studies showed tumor shrinkage in 
selected patients treated with ultra-high doses of lanreotide 
(13) or after a synergistic treatment with interferon alpha 
(22). 
However, to date, although only a limited number 
of patients have been analyzed to provide a definitive 
response (23), these observations, altogether with the much 
more consolidated preclinical data demonstrating 
antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity of SSTRs, 
prompted the pharmacological research to identify novel 
molecules with potential somatostatinergic antitumoral 
activity. 
In this perspective, here we report the state of the 
art of the intracellular mechanisms regulated by SSTR to 
induce antiproliferative activity as possible innovative 
targets of novel SSTR agonists. 
3. MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL 
CHARACTERIZATION OF SSTRs 
Since the synthesis of octreotide, the first 
somatostatin analogue [for rev see (24)], it was postulated 
the existence of multiple SSTRs since it was demonstrated 
a differential pattern of binding of SST and octreotide to rat 
brain slices. These observations were indeed confirmed in 
the early ‘90s when an entire family of five SSTRs was 
molecularly cloned, being named SSTR1 through 5 (25). 
These receptors, whose sequence is highly conserved 
through the species (2-14% divergence between human, rat 
and mice)(26), display a common structure, all belonging to 
the G protein coupled receptors (GPCR). SSTRs are 
encoded by five non-allelic genes located, in humans, on 
chromosomes 14, 17, 22, 20 and 16 for SSTR1-5, 
respectively (see Table 1). Although subsequent 
pharmacological studies proposed the possible existence of 
additional components of this receptor family (27), to date 
no further SSTRs have been cloned. Interestingly, while 
SSTR1, SSTR3, SSTR4 and SSTR5 are intronless genes, in 
humans, mice and rats, SSTR2 gene can produce two splice 
variants of the receptor, named SSTR2A and B, 
characterized by a longer or shorter carboxyl terminus, 
respectively (13 amino acids in humans and 23 in mice)(28, 
29). It was reported that SSTR2A and B isoforms may 
differ in their sensitivity for intracellular signalling 
(inhibition of cAMP production)(30) but the real biological 
meaning of SSTR2B it is not well understood and SSTR2A 
represents the largely dominant isoform in humans. 
All SSTRs possess seven alpha-helical putative 
transmembrane domains, with the N-terminus extracellular 
and the C-terminus intracellular, as expected for all 
GPCRs. The transmembrane domains show the highest

sequence similarity (55-70%) among the SSTR family, 
with the N- and C-termini more divergent (31). Overall 
there is a 39-57% identity in the sequences of these 
receptors that allow the subdivision of SSTRs in two 
subfamilies named SRIF-1 (from the original name of SST, 
Somatotropin Release Inhibiting Factor) that consists of 
SSTR2, SSTR3 and SSTR5, and SRIF-2 that includes 
SSTR1 and SSTR4 (31). Importantly, beside different 
homology sequences, SRIF-1 and SRIF-2 receptor 
subfamilies differ also for their pharmacological features 
and, in particular, for their binding properties to SST 
synthetic agonists. In fact, while all the SSTRs bind with 
similar high affinity (nanomolar range) the natural SST 
isoforms (SST14 and SST28) and the related peptide 
cortistatin (Table 2)[only a slight preference of SSTR5 for 
SST28 was reported (32)], a more selective binding profile 
was identified for the synthetic agonists (Table 2). 
Octreotide, lanreotide, vapreotide and seglitide selectively 
bind SRIF-1 receptors with a high affinity for SSTR2 and 
SSTR5 and intermediate affinity for SSTR3, but do not 
interact with the SRIF-2 subfamily. In consideration of the 
widespread distribution of all the five SSTRs, often 
overlapping in the same cell types, more recently both 
peptidic and non peptidic compounds able to selectively 
modulate the activity of each SSTR subtype were 
developed, as well as pan-SSTR agonists that should better 
mimic the activity of the natural SST (Table 2)(33). 
SSTRs are expressed in discrete or overlapping 
distribution in multiple target organs. Importantly, the 
differences in signal transduction among SSTRs are not 
only related to the specific subtypes, but also to the cellular 
environment, where these receptors are expressed. All 
SSTRs are coupled to G proteins (Table 1) and different 
members of these transducing molecules were identified to 
be coupled to components of the SSTR family. In 
particular, the three isoforms of the inhibitory G proteins 
(Gαi1-3) were all coupled to the different SSTRs (26), 
while, using a mRNA antisense strategy, it was reported the 
coupling of SSTR2 to the Gαo2/β2/γ3 complex to control 
Ca++ channel activity in pituitary cells (34-36). SSTR3 was 
also identified to couple to Gαo, Gα14 and Gα16 (37). It is 
important to note, however, that all the biological effects of 
SSTRs are sensitive to pertussis toxin, with the only 
exception of the regulation of the Na+
/H+
 exchanger, 
NHE1, by SSTR1 (38). 
Recently, the ligand-dependent homodimerization 
was discovered as a novel mechanism for SSTR signalling. 
All SSTRs can homodimerize and more importantly, it was 
demonstrated that SSTRs can also oligomerize with either 
other SSTR subtypes or different families of GPCR, such 
as the µ opioid receptor 1 (MOR1) and the dopamine D2 
receptor (D2R) (39). In particular, SSTR2 can dimerize 
with SSTR3 resulting in a reduced receptor internalization 
and thus, changing the pattern of receptor desensitization 
observed in the individual receptor subtypes (40). SSTR5 
and SSTR1 (but not SSTR4) can also form 
heterocomplexes, with altered internalization properties 
(41). In fact, while SSTR1, when expressed alone, exhibits 
a lack of ligand-induced cell internalization, a significant 
endocytosis occurs when co-expressed with SSTR5. 
SSTR2 was reported to heterodimerize with MOR1 and the 
formation of such complexes, while not affecting the 
receptors signalling, induces a cross-modulation of the 
desensitization and internalization of both receptors (42). 
Conversely, the heterodimers formed by SSTR5 and D2R 
display pharmacological properties that are distinct from 
those of the two individual receptors with an enhanced 
inhibition of cAMP formation (41). The dynamic 
interaction between SSTR5 and D2R can be induced 
independently by both somatostatin and dopamine (41). 
Thus, these receptor interactions may allow the 
activation of intracellular pathways not regulated by the 
individual receptors or modify their binding and 
desensitization responses that may be useful for therapeutic 
purposes. Recently, in light of these studies, chimeric 
molecules with high affinity for both SSTR2/5 and D2R 
(Dopastatins) have been preclinically developed (43-46) 
and will be soon in clinical trials for the treatment of 
pituitary adenomas. 
4. PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES OF SSTRs 
The physiological key role of SST, through the 
activation of SSTRs, is represented by the inhibition of 
many different endocrine and exocrine secretory activities. 
At pituitary level SSTR1 was reported to control the 
secretion of GH and prolactin secretion; SSTR2 is the main 
regulator of the secretion of GH, and ACTH; SSTR5 
controls GH and prolactin release (47). 
In the endocrine pancreas SSTR1 and, at higher 
levels, SSTR5 are expressed in insulin secreting beta-cell, 
SSTR2 mainly in glucagon secreting alpha-cells and 
SSTR5 in the SST-releasing delta-cells, while SSTR3 and 
SSTR4 are poorly expressed (48, 49). In intestinal cells, 
SSTR5 controls the release of glucagon like peptide-1 (50). 
The role of SST is not restricted to the endocrine 
system. SSTR2 is the predominant subtype controlling the 
acid gastric secretion (51), SSTR3, expressed in 
gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells (52), controls their

contractile activity. Furthermore, in studies using SSTR2-
deficient mice, SSTR2 was identified in nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS)-expressing myenteric neurons to modulate 
gut motility (53) as well as it was involved in ductal bile 
absorption and secretion (54). 
SST is also an important neuromodulator within 
the central nervous system, with SSTR expression 
widespread throughout the brain (55). In particular, while 
SSTR1 and SSTR2 expression is diffuse in all the brain, 
SSTR4 is mainly localized in the hippocampus and SSTR5 
in the hypothalamus. Although SSTR1 is also expressed in 
different brain areas its subcellular localization is peculiar, 
being also presynaptic and thus controlling SST release 
from somatostatinergic neurons (56). Behavioural studied 
assessed a role for SST in the modulation of the learning 
and memory processes in different animal models, (57-59) 
suggesting that, in humans, an impairment of the 
somatostatinergic neuronal system may be involved in the 
development of neurodegenerative diseases. In fact, 
although in Alzheimer disease a reduction of SST content 
and SST neurons was known by many years (60-62), the 
alteration of its activity was recently directly associated to 
the generation of the beta-amyloid, one of the pathogenetic 
molecules in this kind of dementia (63). 
In the peripheral nervous system, SST was 
reported to mediate analgesia, through the activity of 
receptors localized in proximity of the pain terminal and 
inhibiting the firing of dorsal horn neurons (64, 65). 
SST has also been implicated in the regulation of 
the immune system, and the chronic inflammatory diseases 
were recently proposed as potential new target pathologies

for SST analogues (66). Different SSTRs were identified in 
thymus (SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR3) with a higher 
expression of SSTR2 in immature thymocytes 
(CD2+/CD3-) and SSTR3 mainly in more mature cells 
(CD3+). Thymic epithelial cells express both SSTR2 and, 
in lower amounts, SSTR1. It was proposed that SSTR3 was 
the main determinant of apoptosis in thymic cells, playing 
relevant physiological functions in thymus (67, 68). SSTR3 
was also expressed by peripheral human T lymphocytes 
(directly derived from mature thymocytes) and its 
activation by SST induces apoptosis in these cells. Both B 
and T lymphocytes, as well as monocytes but not 
granulocytes, express SSTRs. In resting cells SSTR3 is the 
subtype with the highest expression but, upon activation, also 
SSTR2 and SSTR5 are detected, largely increasing the 
sensitivity of these cells to SST analogues (66). In peripheral 
blood immune cells SSTR activation causes: a) the regulation 
of monocyte/macrophage activity reducing the secretion of 
cytokines [IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNFalpha)] 
and interferon gamma; b) the inhibition of the activity of T 
lymphocytes (cytokine release, proliferation), that was 
synergic with that of tacrolimus, leading to a substantial 
immunosuppression; c) the inhibition of the Ig secretion from 
B lymphocytes (69). 
Thus, SST activity, through its specific receptors, 
is involved in a large number of biological functions. 
However, one of the effects that attracted much of the 
interest of the researcher is its prominent role as 
endogenous regulator of cell proliferation. 
5. SSTRs AND TUMOR CELL PROLIFERATION 
SST activity as endogenous antiproliferative agent is 
now recognized in many different experimental tumor models 
in vivo and in vitro. However, these effects, highly significative 
in preclinical studies, become much more questionable when 
the laboratory data are translated to clinical trials. Indeed, 
although SST analogues have been successfully used in few 
specific tumor histotypes, the impressive bulk of preclinical 
data generated in the past years is still far to find a convincing 
general clinical application. Notwithstanding the research is 
still moving further and a significant progress in the 
understanding the mechanisms by which SSTR activation may 
lead to cytostatic or apoptotic effects, has been obtained. In 
particular, it is now commonly accepted that, among all the 
different second messengers regulated by SSTRs, the main 
transduction system involved in the antiproliferative 
activity of SST is represented by the activation of a 
subset of phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTP)(25, 70). 
Moreover, the developing of a large number of 
compounds (agonists or antagonists) for each SSTR 
subtype, as well as molecules with high affinity for 
multiple SSTRs (Table 2), is further increasing the 
potential efficacy of SST analogue-based therapy in 
oncology. Importantly, beside the direct antiproliferative 
effects of SST, an indirect antitumor activity was also 
identified. In fact, early evidences showed that SST 
analogues are able to inhibit the proliferation of SSTR 
negative tumors, such as the Swarm chondrosarcoma (71). It 
was shown that these tumor cells express high levels of IGF-1 
receptors and that the effects of octreotide were mediated by 
the inhibition of the GH-IGF-1 axis, identifying a role for 
the antisecretory activity of SST for its antiproliferative 
effects. More recently, in an experimental model of Kaposi 
sarcoma, in which the tumoral cells do not express SSTR 
mRNA, it was demonstrated that SST and its analogues 
powerfully blocked the in vivo tumor growth through a 
pure antiangiogenic mechanism (72). 
Thus, the effects of SST on tumor cell growth 
may take place at different levels (73): directly blocking the 
cell cycle progression through the binding to SSTRs 
expressed on tumor cell membranes and the activation of 
PTPs, and through the indirect modulation of tumor growth 
mediated by the inhibition of the production of growth 
factors that sustain the tumor development (antisecretory 
activity) or via an antiangiogenic effect that involve the 
regulation of the activity of both endothelial cells and 
monocytes. 
5.1. Direct antiproliferative effects 
The activation of tumor-expressed SSTRs is 
responsible for the direct antiproliferative effects of SST. 
SSTR expression has been detected in most tumors cells. 
Beside pituitary adenomas and other neuroendocrine tumors 
(11, 12), SSTRs have been detected in all the brain tumors 
(gliomas, meningiomas, schwannomas, oligodendrogliomas), 
neuroblastomas, lung, hepatic, breast, ovarian and prostatic 
carcinomas and even in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) 
and soft tissue sarcomas (74-81). Interestingly, as far as 
receptor subtypes and intracellular signalling, the 
antiproliferative effects of SST are dissociated by the 
ability of the peptide to control hormone secretion, as 
demonstrated in both pituitary adenoma cells and 
acromegalic patients (82, 83). 
In most cases the activation of SSTRs causes 
cytostatic effects, with cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. 
However, delving deeper in the SST effects, it is now 
evident that, in some instances, also apoptosis may be 
induced. 
5.1.1. Cytostatic effects. 
The role of SST as an endogenous regulator of 
cell cycle is now a largely recognised activity and, using 
different in vitro and in vivo experimental models, all the 
five SSTR subtypes were reported to induce arrest of cell 
proliferation (33). 
Although many different intracellular pathways 
were recognised to mediate these antiproliferative effects, 
differing not only regarding the SSTR subtype studied but 
also the cellular model analyzed, there is now a large 
consensus about the notion that most of these effects are 
mediated by the activation of phosphotyrosine 
phosphatases (PTP). In turn, the different PTPs, 
activated by SSTRs, control the activity of a number of 
downstream signalling molecules (in particular the MAP 
kinases ERK1 and 2) and, ultimately, induce an up￾regulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI), 
such as p21cip1/waf1 and p27kip1. Conversely, a role for the 
reduction of cAMP production or Ca++ currents in the 
inhibitory effects of SST on cell proliferation was 
observed only in few specific cell types.

An overview of the identified intracellular 
pathways activated by the individual SSTR is reported in 
Table 3 and Figure 1. 
5.1.1.1. Phosphotyrosine PHOSPHATASES 
A possible effect of SST on tyrosine 
phosphorylation signalling was initially postulated since it 
was observed that SST inhibited the proliferation induced 
by tyrosine kinase receptors, in vitro (84). A SST-sensitive 
PTP activity was first described in the MIA-PaCa 
pancreatic tumor cell line (85) in which the treatment with 
SST caused an inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation. The regulation of 
PTP activity by SSTRs was directly shown in tumor cell 
lines, demonstrating that this activity was membrane-bound 
and regulated by pertussis toxin-dependent G proteins, 
whose activation by SSTR was required to induce both PTP 
activity and the dephosphorylation of EGFR (86, 87). More 
recently, an increased PTP activity following lanreotide 
treatment was observed also in primary cell cultures of 
human tumors, including pituitary adenomas (88, 89). 
Interestingly, also the dopamine receptor D2R 
(90), the LHRH receptor (91) and the angiotensin II 
receptor (92, 93) were shown to induce antiproliferative 
effects through the regulation of PTP activity. Thus, the 
regulation of PTP activity is now regarded as a major 
transducing system for G protein coupled receptors to 
induce cell growth arrest. 
Studies using cells transfected with individual 
SSTR subtypes have demonstrated that all the 5 receptor 
subtypes are able to induce PTP activity (94-98). This 
activity was identified to be associated with the cell 
membrane (86)(87) and ascribed to a couple of SH2 
domain-containing PTPs, named SHP-1 and SHP-2 (97, 
99-101). Indeed, these PTPs are localized in the cytosol in 
resting conditions but translocate to the cell membrane after 
SST treatment (99). However, the capability of SST to 
induce PTP activity also when added to partially purified 
membrane preparations (86, 102, 103) led to the hypothesis 
that also other members of the PTP superfamily may be 
involved in the antiproliferative activity of SST. 
Arrest of cell proliferation, dependent on SSTR 
activation of SHP-1, was reported in different tumor cell 
lines derived from breast carcinomas (MCF-7), pancreatic 
cancers (MIA-PaCa, PANC-2, PC-1, PC-3), thyroid 
medullary carcinoma (TT) and pituitary adenomas (GH3), 
among others (104-109). Co-immunoprecipitation studies 
showed that, in CHO cells tranfected with SSTR2 and 
SHP-1, these molecules form a multiprotein complex 
regulated by Gi3α (110). In this cell model, the activation of 
SSTR2 by octreotide promoted the activation of SHP-1 and 
its dissociation from the receptor. SST-activated SHP-1 
rapidly associated to the insulin receptor causing a tyrosine 
dephosphorylation of both the receptor itself and its 
substrates (i.e. IRS-1, Shc) leading to a negative 
modulation of insulin mitogenic signalling (100). The 
antiproliferative effects mediated by SSTR2 were related to 
an inhibition of the S phase entry and accumulation of the 
cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This effect was 
mediated by an induction of p27kip1 expression (but not 
p21cip1/waf1) that, increasing its association with cdk2, 
prevents the recruitment of cyclin E by cdk2 and induces 
the accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma 

Regulation of cell proliferation by somatostatin receptors 
828 
gene product (Rb)(111). In these studies, the activation of 
SHP-1 by SST analogues was related to changes in its own 
phosphorylation state. Thus, it was proposed that this effect 
may involve tyrosine kinase activation. Indeed, the activity 
of the cytosolic tyrosine kinase Jak2 resulted to be 
necessary for both SSTR2-mediated activation of SHP-1 
and the inhibition of AR4-2J pancreatic cancer cell 
proliferation induced by high molecular weight acid FGF 
(112). In this model, SSTR2, Jak2 and SHP-1 are 
associated in a common signalling complex in resting 
conditions: upon SST analogue treatment JAK2 is activated 
inducing SHP-1 phosphorylation and activation, followed 
by a rapid dissociation of both molecules from the receptor 
(112). Moreover, also other PTPs (SHP-2) and cytosolic 
tyrosine kinases (Src) were subsequently detected in a 
multi-effector complex associated to SSTR2 in AR4-2J 
(113). Thus, it was proposed that the cytostatic effects of 
SST analogues, via SSTR2 activation, are the result of the 
sequential activation of kinases and phosphatases with 
SHP-2 activation by Src an absolute requirement for SHP-1 
association to the receptor and activation (113). 
SHP-2 was also involved in the antiproliferative 
activity of SST following SSTR1 activation (97, 101, 114). 
In particular, using SSTR1 expressing CHO-K1 cells, it 
was reported that SST induced cytostatic effects through a 
rapid activation of SHP-2 and Src (114). SHP-2 was 
identified in different cell types including glioma, 
neuroblastoma and thyroid cells. Its activation by SSTRs 
was reported to induce antiproliferative effects via the 
dephosphorylation and inactivation of the tyrosine kinase 
receptors for EGF, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) 
and insulin (115-117) and, in consequence, inhibiting the 
growth factor-dependent activation of ras and ERK1/2 
(118). 
However, in SSTR1-expressing CHO-K1 cells, 
beside SHP-2 activity, also another delayed and long 
lasting PTP activity was observed (101) characterized by 
activation kinetics similar to that observed in membrane 
preparations from MIA-PaCa cells in the initial studies in 
which the activation of PTP by SST was reported (86). 
Thus, it was proposed that other PTPs, likely anchored to 
the cell membrane, could be involved in the SST cytostatic 
effects. One of these PTPs was identified in the receptor￾like PTP named PTPeta (or DEP-1 in humans). In the 
thyroid cell line PC Cl3, a G1 cell cycle arrest via the 
overexpression of the CDKI p27kip1, mediated by the 
activation of PTPs, was observed in response to SST (103, 
117). However, when these cells were transformed by the 
overexpression of different oncogenes (E1A, middle T, 
mos) SST was ineffective (103, 117, 119). Interestingly, in 
mos-transfected cells, the loss of the SST effects on cell 
proliferation occurred in the presence of a SST-activated 
SHP-2 that caused the dephosphorylation and inactivation 
of the insulin receptor (117). It was observed that, in PC 
Cl3 cells, the oncogene-induced cell transformation caused 
the selective loss of the expression of PTPeta as potential 
mechanism of resistance to the antiproliferative effects of 
SST (117, 119). Indeed the re-expression of PTPeta 
completely restored the SST dependent up-regulation of 
p27kip1 (117). The discrepancy in the effects of SHP-2 and 
PTPeta in the regulation of cell proliferation was explained 
according the experimental model used. Indeed, the 
oncogene mos, used to induce the transformation of PC Cl3 
cells, is a direct MEK activator, thus causing the activation 
of ERK1/2 MAP kinase and cell proliferation, also in the 
presence of SHP-2-induced inhibition of the tyrosine 
phosphorylation of growth factor receptors. More 
importantly, these experiments suggested that PTPeta may 
act down-stream of MEK, and thus, directly on ERK1/2 
(117). These results were confirmed studying glioma cell 
lines in which it was shown that SST-activated PTPeta was 
directly associated to ERK1/2 causing the 
dephosphorylation/inactivation of this MAP kinase (80) 
and the up-regulation of p27kip1 (120). In PC Cl3 cells the 
up-regulation of this CDKI was induced through the 
inhibition of its phosphorylation by ERK1/2, preventing its 
ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (117). 
Importantly, in glioma cell lines and primary cultures from 
human glioblastomas, the responsivity to the cytostatic 
activity of SST was strictly related to the expression of 
PTPeta. Since PTPeta expression was observed only in 
about 1/3 of the 22 human glioblastomas analyzed (80), it 
was proposed that the commonly contradictory results 
obtained in vivo using SST analogs as antitumoral agents, 
may be related to the heterogeneous expression of down￾stream effectors (for example PTPeta) rather than SSTRs 
that, on the contrary, are almost constantly detected. 
Further studies will be necessary to confirm this 
hypothesis. 
Thus, in both glioma and thyroid cells, SST 
caused the activation of two PTPs: SHP-2 that is active on 
tyrosine kinase receptors and PTPeta that directly 
dephosphorylate ERK1/2. However, in the same way 
described for SSTR2 and SHP-1, the activation of PTPeta 
by SSTR1 involved a multi-effector complex, comprising 
both kinases and PTPs. In CHO-K1 cells expressing 
SSTR1 (or in C6 glioma cells treated with the SSTR1 
selective agonists, BIM23926) it was shown that in resting 
conditions a large multimeric protein aggregation occurred 
in proximity of SSTR1 that, beside the receptor, included, 
the G protein, Jak2, SHP-2, Src and PTPeta (121). PTPeta 
activation required the sequential activation of Jak2 (G 
protein-mediated), that phosphoryated SHP-2. Upon 
phosphorylation, SHP-2 increases its activity, dissociates 
from the receptor and dephosphorylates the inhibitory 
tyrosine on Src C-terminus. Active Src, in turn, 
phosphorylate PTPeta causing the sustained activity of this 
PTP, to inactivate ERK1/2 (121). 
The identification in different cell models of 
similar multieffector cascades activated by different SSTRs 
(SSTR1 and SSTR2) that, involving a similar interplay of 
kinases and PTPs (Jak2, SHP-2, Src), lead to the activation 
of a final effector PTP (SHP-1 or PTPeta)(113, 121), 
suggests that this multieffector pathway may represent a 
common modular mechanism by which cytostatic 
mechanisms are induced by SST. 
SSTR3 was also reported to activate SHP-2 and 
to detemine Raf-1 inactivation (97, 122) in NIH3T3 cells. 
Similarly, in endothelial cells SSTR3 caused a PTP-

Regulation of cell proliferation by somatostatin receptors 
829 
dependent inhibition of cell proliferation associated to the 
blockade of ERK1/2 activation (123). 
5.1.1.2. MAP kinase activity 
As described above, one of the main final effector 
of the SST-activated PTPs is the inhibition of the activity of 
the MAP kinase ERK1/2, either via an inhibition of the 
growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors or directly 
dephosphorylating ERK1/2 (see above). However, SST can 
induce inhibition of MAP kinase also through different 
mechanisms, namely a SSTR5-dependent inhibition of 
cGMP production and PKG activity (124). 
Interestingly, in some instances, SST can also 
induce cell cycle arrest also through the hyperactivation of 
ERK1/2. It is known that the effects of ERK1/2 on cell 
proliferation are related to also to the duration and intensity 
of ERK1/2 activation (125, 126). Both SSTR1 and SSTR2 
were reported to induce cell cycle arrest via the activation 
of MAP kinases, resulting in an up-regulation of p21cip1/waf1
and p27kip1, respectively (114, 127). Again, only partially 
overlapping intracellular pathways were used by these 
receptors to up-regulate MAP kinase activity. In particular, 
the activation of SSTR1 induced ERK1/2 activity 
regulating, via the beta/gamma subunits of a pertussis 
toxin-sensitive G protein, Src/SHP-2/phosphatidyl inositol 
3 kinase (PI3K)/ras/Raf-1/MEK, while the SSTR2-
regulated pathway involved SHP-1/SHP-2/PI3K/rap1 and 
ras/B-Raf/MEK (114, 127). 
Moreover, also other MAP kinases, more 
frequently associated to the induction of cell growth arrest, 
are regulated by SST: p38 is activated by SSTR2 and 
SSTR4 (but not SSTR3) in CHO-K1 cells (128) and JNK is 
activated by SSTR5 through Gα12 (129). 
In few cases, SST was reported to induce cell 
proliferation. This effect was identified following SSTR4 
activation that increases ERK1/2 activity and, in turn, 
regulates PLA2 phosphorylation and activation (130). In 
transfected CHO cells, the sustained activation of p38 by 
SSTR2A was reported to induce the overexpression of 
p21cip1/waf1 and growth arrest, while in SSTR2B-expressing 
cells caused a transient activation of Akt and increased cell 
proliferation. The differences in the biological responses 
induced by the two SSTR2 isoforms were ascribed to 
possible differences in the beta/gamma subunits activated 
(131). 
5.1.1.3. Phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) 
More recently, an inhibitory effect of SSTR2 on 
PI3K, one of the main intracellular signals that mediate cell 
survival, was reported in different cell systems. In 
particular, in CHO-DG44 cells, the p85 subunit of PI3K is 
associated to the first intracellular loop of SSTR2 and its 
dissociation and dephosphorylation, upon SSTR2 
activation, induces inhibition of PI3K activity (132). In 
pituitary cells, the inhibition of PI3K activity was mediated 
by SHP-1 that dephosphorylates p85 (109). The inhibition 
of PI3K causes reduction of the activities of PDK1 and Akt 
and the consequent activation of glycogen synthase kinase 
3β (GSK3β). The increase of GSK3β activity up-regulated 
the expression of the onco-suppressor gene Zac1 that 
ultimately induced growth arrest and apoptosis (109). 
5.1.1.4. Nitric oxide synthases 
SST was reported to regulate nitric oxide (NO) 
generation through the activation of both the endothelial 
and neuronal nitric oxide synthases (eNOS and nNOS, 
respectively). The effects of SSTRs on eNOS are related to 
the antiangiogenic activity of SST and are detailed in the 
section 5.2.2. 
The activity of nNOS was dually regulated by 
SSTR2 and SSTR5: the former receptor caused activation 
while the latter inhibition of NO generation. However, 
according to the cells analyzed, both effects were reported 
to cause inhibition of cell proliferation. 
SSTR2 caused a SHP-1-dependent 
dephosphorylation and activation of nNOS (133). The 
increased NO production in these cells, resulted in 
activation of cGMP levels and growth arrest (133). 
Opposite effects were reported following SSTR5 
activation that, instead, caused an inhibition of nNOS 
activity (134). SSTR5 activation caused the recruitment of 
nNOS to the receptor and its phosphorylation by Src. The 
phosphorylation prevented nNOS homodimerization and 
activity, an effect that was essential for pancreatic cancer 
cell growth arrest, induced by SST (134). 
5.1.1.5. Na+
-H+
 exchanger (NHE1) 
The inhibition of NHE1 activity is responsible for 
antiproliferative effects of SST in enteric endocrine cells 
and hepatic cells. These effects are mediated by SSTR1, 
SSTR3 and SSTR4, but not by SSTR2 and SSTR5. 
Interestingly the inhibition of NHE1 is the only 
intracellular signalling regulated by SSTRs that was 
reported to be pertussis toxin insensitive (38). 
5.1.1.6. Restoration of GAP junctions 
Gap junctions, mainly composed of connexins, 
are intercellular structures critical for the maintenance of 
the differentiate state. In fact in most tumor cells connexin 
expression is impaired, causing the loss of the density￾dependent cell growth arrest. SSTR2 expression in 
pancreatic cancer cells was reported to induce an over￾expression of the connexins 26 and 43 and to restore the 
contact inhibition of cell proliferation (135). 
5.1.2. Apoptosis 
The induction of apoptosis upon SST treatment 
was detected in both normal and tumoral cells. The first 
identification of the possible pro-apoptotic activity of 
SSTRs was observed in breast and pituitary tumor cell lines 
(136, 137) and resulted to be mediated by PTPs (since it 
was reverted by vanadate). To date the SSTR subtypes 
involved in the induction of apoptosis are SSTR2 and 
SSTR3, acting through the modulation of both the intrinsic 
and the extrinsic intracellular apoptotic pathways. 
The first pathway leads to apoptosis via the 
activation of pro-apoptotic genes (i.e. p53, members of the 

Regulation of cell proliferation by somatostatin receptors 
830 
Bcl2 superfamily) in responses to alteration of 
mitochondrial activity, DNA damage or loss of survival 
factors. The extrinsic pathway is related to the activation or 
sensitization of “death receptors” such as TNFalpha 
receptor 1 (TNFR1). 
The first SSTR subtype reported to induce 
apoptosis was SSTR3. In CHO cells transfected with 
individual, recombinant SSTR subtypes it was shown that, 
among all the SSTRs, only SSTR3 was able to trigger 
apoptosis (96). This effect, mediated by PTPs, was 
dependent on the activation of p53 that preceded the 
induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and the 
triggering of the apoptotic process (136). SSTR3 apoptosis 
was mediated by intracellular acidification (an event 
involving the SST-mediated activation of SHP-1 that, in 
turn, regulates caspase 8 activity)(138, 139) and the 
activation of cation insensitive acid endonucleases (140). In 
these studies, the apoptotic effects, mediated by SSTR3, are 
induced in all the cell cycle phases, and thus independent 
from the cytostatic effects of SST. Interestingly, the 
induction of apoptosis by SSTR3 was an event dependent 
on the cell type analyzed, since no apoptotic effects were 
observed in endothelial cells, when this receptor subtype 
was activated to block angiogenesis (123). 
Subsequently, also SSTR2 activation was 
identified as a mechanism to induce apoptosis. This effect, 
differently from what observed for SSTR3, was 
independent from p53 activation (141) although, in both 
pancreatic and pituitary tumor cells, required the activation 
of the cytosolic PTP SHP-1 (109, 142). SSTR2-mediated 
apoptotic effects were, more recently, identified also in 
somatotroph tumor cells, again via a PTP-dependent and 
p53-, Bcl2/Bax- and death receptor-independent pathway 
(143), and in hepatocarcinoma cells (144). In NIH3T3 
cells, SSTR2 was reported to activate NFkB in a SHP-1-
dependent manner. In this way SSTR2 activation causes an 
inhibition of the anti-apoptotic effects of the MAP kinase 
JNK, whose activity plays an inhibitory role on caspases 
and apoptosis (145). However, differently from pituitary 
cells, in these studies, SSTR2 was shown to affect also the 
apoptosis induced by death receptors, sensitizing the cells 
to TNFalpha- and TRAIL-mediated responses, through the 
up-regulation of their receptors: death receptor 4 (DR4) and 
TNFR1 (142). Moreover, SSTR2 was reported to regulate 
TNFalpha signalling also inducing a synergistic activation 
of NFkB, that caused a higher inhibition of JNK activity 
and, in turn, an hyperactivation of caspase 8 (145). 
5.2 INDIRECT ANTIPROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS 
5.2.1. Antisecretory activity
Decrease of tumor growth may be related to the 
suppression of the secretion or the synthesis and thus the 
activity of growth factors [insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1), EGF, transforming growth factor alpha] and 
hormones (GH, insulin, prolactin)(146). For example many 
neoplasms display receptors for IGF-1 and their activation 
causes tumor cell proliferation (147). Octreotide was 
reported to suppress IGF-1 serum levels through a direct 
inhibition of its gene expression or through the inhibition of 
GH secretion from pituitary and the consequent reduction 
of the GH-stimulated IGF-1 production in liver (148). In a 
model of atherosclerosis, lanreotide caused a significant 
inhibition of different growth factor secretion (EGF, IGF-1, 
PDGF) that caused inhibition of myocyte proliferation in 
vivo but not in vitro (149), clearly demonstrating the 
occurrence of an exclusive indirect antiproliferatve 
mechanism dependent on the antisecretory properties of 
SSTRs. 
The inhibitory effects on GH secretion are 
mediated by the activation of the pituitary SSTR2 and 
SSTR5 through the inhibition of cAMP formation (150, 
151) the reduction of the Ca++ influx through the voltage 
sensitive channels (152) and the activation of K+
 channels 
(153, 154). 
While all SSTR subtypes are able to inhibit 
cAMP production (31), only SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR5 
were reported to inhibit both L- and N- type voltage 
sensitive Ca++ channels (155-157). On the other hand, 
SSTR2 (more efficiently than the other subtypes), SSTR3, 
SSTR4 and SSTR5 (but not SSTR1) were shown to 
activate the G protein gated inward-rectifier K+
 channel 
(GIRK) (158). Conversely, in GH3 cells, SSTR2 and 
SSTR4, and less potently SSTR1 and SSTR5 (but not 
SSTR3) activated the transient outward (IA) and delayed 
rectifier (IK) K+
 currents (159)(see Table 3 and Figure 1). 
In different cell types, it was also reported that 
SST induces also the inhibition of the secretion of other 
growth factors (146), cytokines and chemokines (160, 161), 
all of them possibly involved in the regulation of cell 
proliferation. 
Conversely, the direct inhibition of IGF-1 
production in the liver, depends on the activation of a PTP, 
via SSTR2 and SSTR3, that leads to the dephosphorylation 
of STATb5, impairment of its nuclear localization and a 
decrease in IGF-1 gene transcription (162). 
5.2.2. Antiangiogenic activity
Angiogenesis is a biological activity in which the 
growth of new blood vessels occurs. It is a complex 
multistep process that involves endothelial cell 
proliferation, invasion, adhesion, chemotactic migration, 
morphogenic differentiation in tubular structures and, at the 
end, the production of a basement membrane that surrounds 
the neo-formed vessels (163, 164). In adults, in the absence 
of pathological conditions, angiogenesis is quiescent, with 
a very slow turnover of the endothelial cells (even years). 
Angiogenesis becomes highly active in some important 
physiological conditions such as wound/healing, the 
menstruation and, of course, during the embryogenesis. On 
the other hand, angiogenesis is at the basis of many 
disease-related conditions: proliferative retinopathy, 
reumathoid arthritis, cardiovascular and brain ischemia 
(164). In the past years, the possible pharmacological 
regulation of angiogenesis was under the spot of the 
preclinical and clinical research, being one of the most 
relevant biological processes at the basis of the growth of 
almost every kind of human tumors. Indeed, the inhibition 

Regulation of cell proliferation by somatostatin receptors 
831 
of tumor neo-vascularization may result, in combination 
with cytotoxic therapy in an efficacious and selective 
targeting of most of the tumors that and a more complete 
inhibition of proliferation. 
The first evidence that SST may control 
angiogenesis was in 1991 by Woltering et al. that showed 
that the SST analogues octreotide and vapreotide displayed 
a significant in vitro antiangiogenic activity using the 
chicken corioallanthoic membrane model (CAM)(165). 
This observation was supported by the identification, in 
human primary colorectal carcinomas, breast cancers, renal 
carcinomas and small cell lung carcinomas, of an 
overexpression of SSTRs (in particular SSTR2) in the 
peritumoral vasculature (166), independently from the level 
of expression of this receptor in the tumor cells. Thus, it 
was hypothesized that the regulation of the activity of these 
receptors may represent a novel antitumoral approach. 
Subsequent studies extended the initial observations and an 
antiangiogenic activity of SST and its analogues was 
demonstrated using a number of in vitro and in vivo
experimental models (CAM, matrigel sponge assay, 
etc.)(72, 123, 167-173). Cumulatively, three signal 
pathways were identified as responsible of the 
antiangiogenic activity of SSTRs: 1) inhibition of 
endothelial cell activity (proliferation, migration and 
invasion); 2) inhibition of the synthesis and secretion of 
pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF); 
3) inhibition of monocyte activation. 
5.2.2.1. Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, 
migration and invasion 
The antiproliferative activity of SST analogues on 
endothelial cells was demonstrated in many different in 
vitro cell models including human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVEC), bovine artery endothelial cells 
(BAEC) and established endothelial cell lines (ECV304, 
EAhy926)(72, 123, 164, 174). 
It was reported that octreotide, through the 
activation of SSTR2 and/or SSTR5, inhibits HUVEC 
proliferation (175, 176) and that these receptor subtypes are 
up-regulated during the “angiogenic switch” from resting to 
proliferating endothelia, in vivo (164, 177). However, other 
studies reported, in endothelial cell models, an 
antiproliferative effect of the SSTR pan-agonist SOM230 
(effective on SSTR2, SSTR3, SSTR5 and with slightly 
lower affinity to SSTR1) but not of octreotide, implicating 
the involvement of also other subtypes in such effect (178). 
Indeed, in the immortalized endothelial cell line EAhy926, 
that express mRNA only for SSTR3, SST or the selective 
peptidomimetic SSTR3 agonist L-796,778, induced a 
significant inhibition of the growth factor-induced 
proliferation, an effect that was reverted in the presence of 
the SSTR3 antagonist BN81685 (72, 123). Importantly, the 
latter results were reproduced in vivo in mice, evaluating 
angiogenesis (matrigel sponge assay) and tumor growth 
(xenotransplantation of the Kaposi sarcoma derived cells, 
KSImm)(72). Particularly relevant were the experiments 
using the KSImm cells, since the KSImm tumor growth in 
mice was inhibited by SST and its analogues in vivo, with 
an efficacy comparable to the cytotoxic drug adriamicyn, 
despite these cells do not express any SSTR mRNA and 
their proliferation is not affected in vitro (72, 123). Thus, in 
this case, a pure antiangiogenic mechanism was proposed 
for the antitumoral effects of SST. 
The antiproliferative effect of SST on endothelial 
cells through the activation of SSTR3 was mediated by the 
inhibition of the activities of ERK1/2 MAP kinase and 
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (123). Both 
pathways are relevant during angiogenesis, since the 
vasodilatation induced by nitric oxide (NO) is a 
prerequisite for the subsequent ERK1/2-mediated cell cycle 
activation in endothelial cells (179). Subsequently, it was 
demonstrated that also other SSTRs (SSTR1, SSTR2 and 
SSTR3, but not SSTR4) can control eNOS activity (180). 
In these studies, using CHO-K1 cells, it was demonstrated 
that independent pathways control NO production when 
activated by different receptors: the modulation of the 
release of Ca++ from the intracellular stores, upon 
colecystokinin treatment, or the sphyngomyelinase￾dependent generation of ceramide, induced by bFGF (181, 
182). Expressing individual SSTRs in CHO-K1 cells it was 
demonstrated that the former effect was inhibited via the 
activation of SSTR2 and SSTR3, while SSTR1, SSTR2 and 
SSTR3 were all effective in reverting the NO production 
induced by bFGF (180). Conversely, SSTR4 was not able 
to control the activation of eNOS, independently from the 
intracellular pathway activated (180). 
SSTRs were also able to interfere with 
endothelial cell adhesion, migration and invasion, all 
functions required for the developing of new vessels. For 
example, this inhibitory activity was induced in vitro, using 
vapreotide or a derivative with enhanced lipophylic 
properties (164, 169). Octreotide also inhibited HUVEC 
invasion elicited by VEGF (175). In tumor cell lines, the 
anti-invasive effects of SST were dependent on the 
inhibition of MAP kinase and the small G protein Rac 
(183) and involved the inhibition of the expression of 
metalloproteases such as MMP2 (184). 
5.2.2.2. Inhibition of the synthesis and secretion of pro￾angiogenic factors
SST can also control angiogenesis through its 
antisecretory properties. Indeed, it is now well documented 
that beside hormones (GH, ACTH, insulin, etc) the 
activation of SSTRs may inhibit also the release of growth 
factors or cytokines. As far as the inhibition of pro￾angiogenic factors release, this effect was reported to 
involve mainly the synthesis and/or the secretion of VEGF 
and bFGF (146, 185). These factors are indeed produced by 
different tumor cells and by infiltrating inflammatory cells, 
to promote endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation 
and migration, being these effects important for the tumoral 
vascularization when the developing tumor mass becomes 
hypoxic (186). In glioma cell lines and in human colorectal 
and pancreatic cancer cells, SSTR2 agonists were reported 
to inhibit VEGF and bFGF secretion acting at mRNA level 
(184, 187, 188). In particular in glioma cells, the SSTR2 
selective agonist L-054,552 abrogated the secretion of 
VEGF induced by EGF, bFGF or hypoxia (187). Similar 

Regulation of cell proliferation by somatostatin receptors 
832 
effects on VEGF release were also observed in retinal 
pigment epithelial cells (189), where this growth factor 
plays a relevant role in the diabetic retinopathy through an 
angiogenesis-related mechanism (190). The inhibition of 
pro-angiogenic factor release was observed also in vivo, 
since it was reported that administration of octreotide 
significantly reduced VEGF and bFGF serum levels in 
patients with gastric carcinoma (191). Similarly to what 
observed for the antisecretory activity on hormones, the 
inhibition of angiogenic growth factors release involves 
mainly the regulation of cAMP production and ion fluxes 
(25). 
5.2.2.3. Inhibition of monocyte activation 
 Monocytes represent other important mediators 
of the tumoral angiogenenic process. These cells, 
infiltrating the peritumoral area in response to VEGF (192), 
produce pro-survival and pro-angiogenic factors resulting 
in the activation of endothelial cells and the induction of 
neo-vascularization. SST was reported to inhibit monocyte 
migration and their recruitment in the areas where new 
vessels are formed (172, 193). In a model of Kaposi 
sarcoma, SST, through the interaction with SSTR2, SSTR3 
and SSTR5, was reported to inhibit monocyte activation 
(evaluated as morphological changes, such as cell 
polarization) to impair both in vivo angiogenesis and tumor 
growth (72). 
6. PERSPECTIVE 
The use of SSTR agonists as antiproliferative 
agents represents a powerful therapeutic possibility in 
oncology. This approach in the past years was supported by 
the widespread expression of SSTRs in most tumor cells 
and by the strong antitumor activity of SST synthetic 
analogues observed in vitro. However to date, beside few 
cases (mainly pituitary adenomas and some neuroendocrine 
tumors), the promises raised by the large bulk of preclinical 
data has not been fulfilled. The reason for this partially 
unexpected failure it is not clear. Indeed, SSTRs controls 
tumor proliferation through both direct and indirect 
mechanisms, showing simultaneously both antiproliferative 
and antiangiogenic properties that in theory should 
represent the gold standard for an antineoplastic agent. 
However, in the last years the preclinical research greatly 
increased our knowledge concerning the antiproliferative 
mechanisms activated by SSTR and the discovery of the 
possible activation of PTP by G protein coupled receptors 
represents one of the more exciting biological discoveries 
in the past decades. Thus, it is now accepted that, among 
the plethora of intracellular second messengers regulated 
by SSTR, the antiproliferative activity and the apoptosis 
induced by SST are mediated by the activation of specific 
PTPs. It has been shown that the expression of PTPs in 
tumor cells can dictate the responsivity to SST, and thus a 
more consistent antiproliferative response could be 
obtained targeting specifically these intracellular effectors. 
Moreover, the identification of a more precise expression 
pattern for SSTRs, showing an almost constant presence of 
multiple subtypes in the same cell, changed also the 
research of novel agonist molecules from highly selective 
to multi-receptor agonists or even pan SSTR agonists that 
are presently tested in clinical trials. Finally, the 
identification of the agonist-dependent heterodimerization 
of SSTRs and D2R allowed the development of completely 
innovative agonists that bind and activate both receptors. 
Thus, it is possible that more satisfying results will be 
obtained in the next years. Moreover, it is clear that a closer 
interaction between preclinical and clinical research will be 
necessary to further develop these results.
