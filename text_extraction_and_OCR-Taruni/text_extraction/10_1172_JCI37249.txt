The renin-angiotensin system plays a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure and is involved in the pathogen￾esis of kidney disorders and other diseases. Here, we report that the growth factor midkine is what we believe
to be a novel regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. The hypertension induced in mice by 5/6 nephrec￾tomy was accompanied by renal damage and elevated plasma angiotensin II levels and was ameliorated by an
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker. Notably, ACE activity
in the lung, midkine expression in the lung, and midkine levels in the plasma were all increased after 5/6
nephrectomy. Exposure to midkine protein enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human lung micro￾vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, hypertension was not induced and renal damage was less severe in
midkine-deficient mice. Supplemental administration of midkine protein to midkine-deficient mice restored
ACE expression in the lung and hypertension after 5/6 nephrectomy. Oxidative stress might be involved in
midkine expression, since expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase–1, –2, and –4 was induced in the lung after
5/6 nephrectomy. Indeed, the antioxidative reagent tempol reduced midkine expression and plasma angio￾tensin II levels and consequently ameliorated hypertension. These results suggest that midkine regulates the
renin-angiotensin system and mediates the kidney-lung interaction after 5/6 nephrectomy.
Introduction
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormonal cascade that 
functions in the homeostatic control of arterial pressure, tissue 
perfusion, and extracellular volume. Dysregulation of the RAS 
results in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cardiovas￾cular and renal disorders (1–3). The RAS is initiated by the regulated 
secretion of renin, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of Ang I from the 
N terminus of angiotensinogen. Ang I is in turn hydrolyzed by angio￾tensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to form Ang II, the primary active 
product of the RAS (4, 5). ACE is a zinc metallopeptidase widely 
distributed on the cell membrane of endothelial and epithelial cells 
(6). Ang II induces vasoconstriction and aldosterone release, leading 
to upregulation of blood pressure. It also exerts its vasoconstrictor 
effect on both the afferent and efferent arterioles, which may con￾tribute to the onset and progression of chronic renal damage. Ang II 
may also directly contribute to the acceleration of renal damage by 
sustaining cell growth, inflammation, and fibrosis (7).
The growth factor midkine (MK; gene symbol, MDK) is impli￾cated in cancer progression, neuronal survival and differentiation, 
and inflammation (8). MK is involved in the pathogeneses of tubu￾lointerstitial damage induced by renal reperfusion and glomerular 
sclerosis associated with diabetes mellitus (9, 10). The finding of a 
recent report that angiotensinogen and renin expression was sig￾nificantly elevated in the aorta of Mdk–/– mice while ACE expres￾sion was significantly suppressed is of particular interest (11). 
However, Mdk–/– mice develop normally (8), and there has been no 
report of systemic disturbance or organ disorders of Mdk–/– mice. 
Therefore, the biological meaning of changes in the RAS molecules 
in the aorta of Mdk–/– mice has remained obscure.
It is widely accepted that the RAS is involved in the pathogenesis 
of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and inhibitors of the RAS are the 
first choice of therapy for CKD (12–14). To investigate the molec￾ular mechanisms regulating the RAS in CKD, we employed 5/6 
nephrectomy in this study. 5/6 nephrectomized mice are a popular 
and useful model of CKD, since the remnant kidney model of pro￾gressive renal injury is characterized by systemic hypertension and 
glomerular hyperfiltration, the latter eventually causing glomeru￾lar sclerosis (15, 16). CKD accompanies multiple organ failure, the 
pathogenesis of which involves inter-organ cross-talk (17, 18). In 
this context, it is noteworthy that MK expression was induced in 
the lung by 5/6 nephrectomy, leading to elevation of ACE activ￾ity and plasma Ang II levels and subsequent hypertension in the 
present study. Our data therefore suggest that MK is a candidate 
mediator of inter-organ cross-talk in CKD.
Results
MK is involved in RAS activation induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. Systolic 
and mean blood pressure were comparable in untreated Mdk+/+
and Mdk–/– mice (Figure 1, A and B). However, we found that 5/6 
nephrectomy strikingly increased blood pressure in Mdk+/+ mice 
but not in Mdk–/– mice (Figure 1, A and B). The systolic and mean 
blood pressure of Mdk+/+ mice strikingly increased after 2 weeks, 
but Mdk–/– mice showed almost normal blood pressure, i.e., no

significant increase (systolic blood pressure, 143 ± 11.6 mmHg in 
Mdk+/+ mice vs. 119 ± 8.6 mmHg in Mdk–/– mice; mean blood pres￾sure, 104 ± 10.3 mmHg vs. 85 ± 6.7 mmHg). Consequently, systolic 
and mean blood pressures were significantly higher in Mdk+/+ than 
in Mdk–/– mice from 2 to 8 weeks (Figure 1, A and B).
5/6 nephrectomy caused not only hypertension but also progres￾sive renal failure. Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels 
gradually increased, and both parameters were significantly higher 
in Mdk+/+ mice at 2 and 4 weeks after renal ablation (Table 1). 
Mdk+/+ mice also exhibited more severe glomerular sclerosis, which 
is characterized by a marked deposition of extracellular matrix in 
the glomeruli and which occurred as early as 2 weeks after renal 
ablation (Figure 1C). Semiquantitative analysis of the glomerular 
sclerosis scores revealed significant differences between Mdk+/+

and Mdk–/– mice (Figure 1D). In addition, the tubulointerstitial 
damage was worse in Mdk+/+ mice (Supplemental Figure 1; sup￾plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI37249DS1). Thus, tubular dilatation, cast formation in the 
tubular lumen, and tubular epithelial degeneration became 
apparent at 2 weeks after renal ablation and were more severe in 
Mdk+/+ mice (Supplemental Figure 1, A–H). Interstitial fibrosis, as 
evidenced by collagen deposition revealed by Masson’s trichrome 
staining, was exhibited at 4 weeks and then more diffusely at 
8 weeks, and the stained area became expanded in Mdk+/+ mice 
(Supplemental Figure 1, I–P). These data collectively indicate that 
renal damage was more severe in Mdk+/+ mice than in Mdk–/– mice.
These symptoms of hypertension and renal damage were attribut￾able to the RAS, as (a) the hypertension was accompanied by elevated 
plasma Ang II concentration (Figure 1E); and (b) the ACE inhibitor 
temocapril and the angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan reduced 
both blood pressure and renal tubulointerstitial damage, but the 
vasodilator hydralazine only ameliorated hypertension (Figure 1, 
F–H). Abnormal elevation of blood urea nitrogen and serum creati￾nine was ameliorated by administration of temocapril and olmesar￾tan, but not hydralazine (Table 1). It is therefore conceivable that the 
RAS contributed to both hypertension and renal damage.
ACE levels are increased in the lung after 5/6 nephrectomy. Expression 
of the intrarenal angiotensinogen and renin was suppressed and 
ACE expression was unchanged in Mdk+/+ mice, which was con￾sistent with previous findings after 5/6 nephrectomy of rats (19, 
20) (Supplemental Figure 2, A–C). In contrast to the kidney, the 
lung showed significant increases in ACE expression and its activ￾ity 2 and 4 weeks after renal ablation (Figure 2, A–E). ACE protein 
expression was localized to the pulmonary vascular endothelial 
cells and alveolar-capillary endothelial cells, consistent with a pre￾vious report (Figure 2D) (21).
Other organs that play major func￾tions in the RAS were also examined 
for their expression of RAS com￾ponents. Angiotensinogen mRNA 
expression was induced in the liver 
after 5/6 nephrectomy, but the 
expression level was not significantly 
different in Mdk+/+ and Mdk–/– mice 
(Supplemental Figure 3A). There was 
no difference in angiotensinogen pro￾tein levels between the two genotypes 
(Supplemental Figure 3, B and C), 
and renin mRNA expression was not 
detected in the liver (data not shown). 
Expression of ACE protein and MK 
protein was also not detected in the 
liver (Supplemental Figure 3, D and 
E). In the brain, mRNA expression 
of angiotensinogen and ACE did not 
change after 5/6 nephrectomy (Sup￾plemental Figure 4, A and B), and the 
renin mRNA expression was unde￾tectable (data not shown). ACE pro￾tein was also not detected in the brain 
(Supplemental Figure 4C). Further￾more, the mRNA expression of angio￾tensinogen, renin, and ACE did not 
change in the heart (Supplemental 
Figure 5). Therefore, it is most likely that the hypertension observed 
after 5/6 nephrectomy was due to activation of the lung ACE.
MK levels are increased in the lung, kidney, and plasma after 5/6 nephrec￾tomy. MK expression was increased in the lung in association with 
an elevation in ACE expression (Figure 3, A–C). MK protein was 
localized to the endothelium of microvessels of the lung, as revealed 
by the use of thrombomodulin as a marker of the vascular endothe￾lium (Figure 3D). MK expression was detected in alveolar-capillary 
endothelial cells but not in bronchial epithelial cells (Figure 3D).
Histological evidence of lung damage, i.e., due to edema and 
degeneration of alveolar cells, was not observed after 5/6 nephrec￾tomy in the Mdk+/+ and Mdk–/– mice (Supplemental Figure 6A). 
Increases in macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into the lung 
were also not observed after 5/6 nephrectomy in the two geno￾types (Supplemental Figure 6, B–E). These results indicated that 
the increase in MK expression in the lung after 5/6 nephrectomy 
was not due to leukocytes.
MK expression was also significantly elevated in the kidney at 
both the protein and mRNA levels 2 and 4 weeks after renal abla￾tion (Supplemental Figure 7, A–C). Immunohistochemical analysis 
revealed that MK protein was mainly localized in the tubular epi￾thelium (Supplemental Figure 8A). This result is consistent with 
previous reports in which MK was expressed in the kidney after 
ischemia/reperfusion injury and its associated massive leukocyte 
infiltration (22). We also detected a substantial increase in macro￾phage infiltration into the kidney after 5/6 nephrectomy, and this 
increase was significantly higher in Mdk+/+ mice than Mdk–/– mice 
(Supplemental Figure 8, B and C). It is known that MK is expressed 
by activated macrophages (23, 24). Thus, it is conceivable that the 
increase in MK expression in the kidney after 5/6 nephrectomy was 
due to enhanced expression in both the tubular epithelium and 
infiltrating macrophages.

Since MK is a secreted protein, and its expression was induced 
by 5/6 nephrectomy in the kidney and lung (Figure 3, A–C, and 
Supplemental Figure 7, A–C), we next examined plasma MK lev￾els. As shown in Figure 3, E and F, plasma MK levels were indeed 
increased 2 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy.
Exogenous MK induces ACE expression. If MK is required for ACE 
expression in the lung and hypertension, supplementary adminis￾tration of MK might also affect these symptoms. To clarify this issue, 
we administered exogenous MK continuously through an osmotic 
pump into Mdk–/– mice after 5/6 nephrectomy. This administration 
was found to restore hypertension and ACE expression in the lung 
(Figure 4, A–C). We also administered pleiotrophin (PTN; also called 
HB-GAM), which shows 50% homology with MK (8), to Mdk–/– mice 
after 5/6 nephrectomy. However, exogenous PTN neither induced 
hypertension nor increased ACE expression in the lung (Figure 4, A, 
D, and E). These data support the specificity of MK with respect to 
its involvement in ACE expression and blood pressure regulation.
Furthermore, exogenous MK protein on primary cultured human 
lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) significantly 
enhanced ACE expression, suggesting that ACE is one of the tar￾gets of MK in the lung (Figure 5, A and B). When Ang I was added 
to the culture medium of the lung endothelial cells treated with 
MK and heparin for 36 hours, Ang I was converted to Ang II in a 
time-dependent manner, while cells 
treated with heparin alone did not 
show such a conversion (Figure 5C). 
These results suggest that MK is a 
potent inducer of Ang II through 
upregulation of ACE expression in 
lung endothelial cells.
Along with the increase in ACE 
expression, phosphorylation lev￾els of PKC were also increased in 
primary cultured HMVEC-L after 
exposure to exogenous MK (Fig￾ure 5, D and E). This result sug￾gests that MK upregulates ACE 
expression through activation of 
PKC. This idea was further sup￾ported by three lines of evidence. 
First, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIS), 
a PKC-specific inhibitor, blocked 
the MK-mediated increase in ACE 
expression (Figure 5, A and B). Sec￾ond, PKC phosphorylation was sig￾nificantly increased in the lungs of 
Mdk+/+ but not Mdk–/– mice after 5/6 
nephrectomy (Figure 5F). Third, 
consistent with previous reports 
(25), the increase in ACE expres￾sion in primary cultured HMVEC-L 
was also induced by PMA, a PKC 
activator, and was blocked by BIS 
(Supplemental Figure 9).
Oxidant stress induces MK expression 
in the lung after 5/6 nephrectomy. Final￾ly, the mechanism of MK induction 
in the lung by 5/6 nephrectomy was 
investigated. The NADPH oxidases 
(Nox’s) are superoxide-generating 
enzymes that release superoxide by electron transfer from NADPH 
to oxygen. Increased production of ROS has been implicated in var￾ious pathologies, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, 
and CKD (26, 27). In the present study, Nox1, -2, and -4 mRNA 
expression in the lungs of Mdk+/+ mice was found to be significantly 
increased at 2 and 4 weeks after renal ablation compared with the 
levels in the sham-operated animals, suggesting that oxidant stress 
was generated in the lung; in contrast, the expression of Nox1, 
-2, and -4 mRNA was unchanged in the Mdk–/– mice (Figure 6A). 
A cell membrane–permeable radical scavenger, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-
tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (tempol), reduced MK expression to 
normal levels in the lung (Figure 6B); plasma Ang II levels (Figure 
1E) and blood pressure (Figure 6C) were also reduced. Tempol also 
ameliorated glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage 
(Figure 6D) and improved renal function, i.e., significantly reduced 
blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels (Table 1). These 
results suggest that MK expression was induced by oxidative stress 
in the lung after 5/6 nephrectomy. Tempol also reduced MK expres￾sion in the kidney (Supplemental Figure 7, D and E).
Discussion
Our study demonstrated that Mdk–/– mice had almost normal 
blood pressure after 5/6 nephrectomy, while wild-type mice showed

marked hypertension. This hypertension was ameliorated by RAS￾related inhibitors and indeed was accompanied by elevated plasma 
Ang II levels. Surprisingly, ACE activity was enhanced in the lung, 
whereas RAS components were not activated in other organs. Plas￾ma MK levels and MK expression in the lung and kidney were ele￾vated. Supplementary MK administration to Mdk–/– mice restored 
lung ACE expression and hypertension. MK also induced ACE 
expression and consequently conversion from Ang I to Ang II in 
primary cultured lung microvascular endothelial cells. We therefore 
concluded that MK-mediated ACE induction in the lung is critical 
for hypertension induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Figure 7).
Inter-organ interactions involving the kidney have recently been 
highlighted. Regarding factors affecting lung function after acute 
kidney injury, several cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, 
have been suggested as candidates (28, 29). Such results contrib￾ute to our understanding of the high mortality associated with 
pulmonary complications following acute kidney injury. CKD 
has also been linked with damage in other organs, especially with 
cardiovascular damage (so-called cardiorenal syndrome) (30). It 
is particularly interesting that RAS components are increased in 
the heart and brain of subtotally nephrectomized rats (20, 31) and 
that Ang II amounts are increased in the isolated perfused hind 
limbs of uremic rats (32). Inhibitors of the RAS, e.g., angiotensin 
receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors, are indeed the first choice 
of therapy for CKD (33). Our results clearly show that the lung is 
a promising target in the cross-talk between the kidney and other 
organs and suggest that MK is a candidate mediator for pulmo￾nary and other organ complications associated with CKD.
Regarding the cross-talk between the kidney and lung in 5/6 
nephrectomy, our study has also provided an insight into the under￾lying mechanism. We found that Nox1, -2, and -4 were induced in 
the lung and that tempol reduced MK and plasma Ang II levels. 
Nox mediates the initial reaction of 3 successive reduction prod￾ucts of molecular oxygen, i.e., superoxide (O2
•–), hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (OH•). Since tempol is a membrane￾permeable and metal-independent superoxide dismutase mimetic 
that is specific for superoxide anion (O2
•–) (34, 35), tempol may tar￾get ROS initiated by Nox in the lung. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first study to show that 5/6 nephrectomy induces oxida￾tive stress in the lung. We have previously reported that oxidative

stress induces MK expression (10, 22). Therefore, it is conceivable 
that Nox-mediated ROS production leads to an induction of MK 
expression in the lung (Figure 7). As ROS have very short half-lives 
(36), it is not likely that the ROS themselves travel between the kid￾ney and lung. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that Ang II induces 
Nox expression (37). Based on this background data, we speculate 
that the following molecular circuit is established after circulating 
MK induces ACE expression in the lung: Ang II induces Nox expres￾sion, which in turn initiates ROS production and subsequently MK 
and ACE expression (Figure 7).
RAS-related inhibitors, but not hydralazine, ameliorated renal 
damage in the present study. It has also been reported that system￾ically administered Ang II worsens renal function (38–40). There￾fore, the RAS might play at least a partial role in renal damage. In

addition, we found a significant elevation of macrophage infiltra￾tion into the kidney in wild-type mice compared with Mdk–/– mice 
in the present study. This finding is consistent with our previous 
report showing MK-mediated macrophage recruitment in neointi￾ma formation (41). Therefore, MK-mediated inflammation in the 
kidney may contribute to the renal damage after 5/6 nephrectomy 
(Figure 7). On the other hand, in the context of inflammation and 
hypertension, it is important to note that inflammatory cell infil￾tration into the kidney does not always induce hypertension (42, 
43). Furthermore, the local RAS in organs other than the lung was 
not activated in the present study. Thus, the relationship between 
intrarenal inflammation and hypertension after 5/6 nephrectomy 
remains to be verified.
Methods
Animals and experimental design. Mice deficient in Mdk were generated as 
described previously (44). After backcrossing of Mdk+/– mice for 14 genera￾tions with 129/Sv mice, Mdk+/– mice were mated with each other to gener￾ate Mdk+/+ and Mdk–/– mice, which were used in this study. Experiments 
were performed on 8- to 12-week-old female mice weighing 20–25 g that 
were housed under controlled environmental conditions and maintained 
with standard food and water. Animal care and experimental procedures 
were approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee of the Nagoya 
University Graduate School of Medicine and were conducted according 
to the Nagoya University Regulations for Experiments. Renal ablation 
was performed as described previously. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by 
diethyl ether. The flank region was shaved, and the animals were placed 
on a heating pad to maintain a constant body temperature (37°C). Under 
anesthesia, right flank incisions were made, and the right kidney was 
removed. Seven days later, mice were anesthetized as above, and two-thirds 
of the mass of the left kidneys was ablated (Mdk+/+: 2 weeks, n = 13; 4 weeks, 
n = 13; 8 weeks, n = 8; Mdk–/–: 2 weeks, n = 10; 4 weeks, n = 10; 8 weeks, 
n = 4). After the renal ablation, the flanks were closed in 2 layers with 5-0 
silk sutures. The animals received 100 ml/kg warm saline instilled into the 
peritoneal cavity during the procedure and were allowed to recover with 
free access to food and water. In the control mice, a sham operation was 
performed (Mdk+/+, n = 11; Mdk–/–, n = 8).
Drug treatment model. In the drug treatment studies, Mdk+/+ mice were 
randomly assigned to receive one of the following 5 treatments after 5/6 
nephrectomy and were orally treated daily starting from 24 hours after 5/6 
nephrectomy: vasodilator (hydralazine hydrochloride; Novartis) at a dose 
of 10 mg/kg/d (group 1, n = 3); ACE inhibitor (temocapril; Daiichi Sankyo 
Co.) at a dose of 3 mg/kg/d (group 2, n = 3); angiotensin receptor blocker 
(olmesartan; Daiichi Sankyo Co.) at a dose of 3 mg/kg/d (group 3, n = 3); 
antioxidative reagent (tempol; Alexis Biochemicals) at a dose of 3 mmol/l 
in drinking solution after 5/6 nephrectomy (group 4, n = 6); and sham 
operation (group 5, n = 6). Drug treatment was performed at 2 weeks after 
5/6 nephrectomy. In the present study, we determined the dosage accord￾ing to previous reports (45–47). Blood pressure was measured by the tail￾cuff method at 2 weeks, as described below under Blood pressure monitoring. 
Mice were sacrificed at 2 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy, and blood and tis￾sue samples were collected.

MK expression in the lung. Tempol mixed in drinking water was administered to Mdk+/+ mice after 5/6 nephrectomy. MK protein expression was 
determined by Western blotting (upper panel). The intensity of MK bands on Western blotting was normalized to that of β-actin (lower panel).

MK protein and PTN protein. The recombinant human MK (rh-MK) was 
produced from yeast as described previously (48). In brief, human MK was 
produced by Pichia pastoris GS115 transfected with a human MK expression 
vector, which was constructed into pHIL-D4 (Invitrogen) (48). The MK pro￾tein was then purified by anion exchange chromatography and affinity chro￾matography on a heparin column. The purified human protein exhibited 
neurotrophic activity comparable to that of mouse MK produced in L cells 
(49). Recombinant human PTN was produced as previously described (50).
rh-MK and -PTN treatment model. In the pump study, MK protein in 
saline (1.6 mg/ml) (n = 5), PTN in saline (1.6 mg/ml; n = 5), or saline alone 
(n = 5) was infused using an osmotic pump (ALZA Corp.) into Mdk–/–
mice after 5/6 nephrectomy. The pumps continuously infused a total of 
100 μl over 14 days. The pumps were implanted under the dorsal skin 
the next day after 5/6 nephrectomy. Blood pressure was measured by the 
indirect tail-cuff technique at 0 and 2 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy. Mice 
were sacrificed at 2 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy, and blood and tissue 
samples were collected.
Blood pressure monitoring. Blood pressure was measured in restrained, 
conscious mice by the indirect tail-cuff technique under unstressed condi￾tions (BP-98A; Softron) at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy 
(51). Before measurement, the mice were warmed with a heating pad for 
5 minutes. A total of 7–10 readings were taken for each mouse, at 1- to 
2-minute intervals.
Sample collection. Mice were sacrificed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after 5/6 nephrec￾tomy. The remnant kidney, lung, brain, heart, and liver were removed rap￾idly, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C until examinations 
were performed. Each tissue was processed for histology, protein extraction, 
and RNA extraction. Blood samples were collected into chilled tubes for 
measurement of renal function parameters and into chilled tubes contain￾ing EDTA for Ang II measurements. Serum and plasma were separated by 
centrifugation (500 g for 10 minutes) and stored at –80°C until measure￾ment were performed. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (Mdk+/+: sham, 
n = 6; 2 weeks, n = 10; 4 weeks, n = 9; 8 weeks, n = 8; Mdk–/–: sham, n = 7; 
2 weeks, n = 7; 4 weeks, n = 6; 8 weeks, n = 4), and Ang II concentrations 
(Mdk+/+: sham, n = 6; 2 weeks, n = 6; 4 weeks, n = 8; Mdk–/–: sham, n = 6; 
2 weeks, n = 7; 4 weeks, n = 5) were measured by Mitsubishi BCL.
ACE activity assay. Lung ACE activity was measured in a fluorescence 
assay using a commercial ACE activity assay kit (Life Laboratory Company, 
Yamagata, Japan). Isolated lung tissue (Mdk+/+: sham, n = 5; 2 weeks, n = 5; 
4 weeks, n = 5; Mdk–/–: sham, n = 5; 2 weeks, n = 5; 4 weeks, n = 4) was 
homogenized in an assay buffer and then clarified by centrifugation at 
10,000 g for 15 minutes at 4.0°C. ACE activity against a synthetic substrate 
(benzyloxycarbonyl-phenyl alanyl-leucine) was determined using a colo￾rimetric method. The product was measured fluorometrically at 355-nm 
excitation and 460-nm emission with a fluoro-colorimeter, as follows. For 
the assay, tissue samples were standardized to 1 μg protein/ml. Results 
were calculated as mU/mg protein. All data are reported as mean ± SD. The 
measurements were performed in duplicate.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. The removed kidneys and lungs were 
fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and then cut into 
4-μm sections. The sections were stained with H&E, PAS, and Masson’s tri￾chrome. Another tissue sample was embedded in OCT compound (Sakura 
Finetek) and frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunostaining. Sections were 
cut to a thickness of 3 μm with a cryostat and fixed in acetone. High-power 
fields were used to examine the sections for evidence of focal sclerosis (52, 
53). Glomerular sclerosis was assessed by semiquantitative score (grades 0 to 
+4) using the method of Raij et al. (54): grade 0, no sclerosis of glomeruli; 
grade 1, sclerosis of up to 25% of glomerulus; grade 2, sclerosis of 25%–50% 
of glomerulus; grade 3, sclerosis of 50%–75% of glomerulus; grade 4, sclerosis 
of 75%–100% of glomerulus. At least 50 glomeruli were evaluated under ×400 
magnification and results averaged for each kidney (Mdk+/+: 2 weeks, n = 5; 
4 weeks, n = 4; 8 weeks, n = 4; Mdk–/–: 2 weeks, n = 4; 4 weeks, n = 3; 8 weeks, 
n = 3). Immunostaining for ACE and MK was performed on buffered forma￾lin–fixed tissues. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, incubated in 3% 
hydrogen peroxide in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase, and washed 
in 10% normal goat serum (Dako) in PBS to block nonspecific binding. Sub￾sequently, sections were incubated with mouse anti-ACE monoclonal anti￾body (dilution, 1:400; Chemicon International, Millipore) or anti-MK mono￾clonal antibody (dilution, 1:100) overnight at 4°C as described previously 
(22), followed by a conjugate of polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG antibody 
and HRP-labeled polymer (Histofine Simple Stain; Nichirei) for 1 hour at 
room temperature as a secondary antibody. The staining was visualized with 
3-3′ diaminobenzidine (Nichirei) to produce a brown color. The sections were 
covered with 90% glycerol containing p-phenylenediamine and were examined 
by electron microscopy (H-7100; Hitachi). For double immunofluorescence 
staining of MK and thrombomodulin as a marker of the vascular endothe￾lium, the cryosections of lungs were first incubated with chicken anti–human 
MK (dilution, 1:200) and then with rabbit anti–rat thrombomodulin (dilu￾tion, 1:1,000) (55), followed by incubation with FITC-labeled rabbit anti￾chicken IgG (dilution, 1:160) and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG 
(dilution, 1:320) as secondary antibodies. For immunofluorescence staining 
of macrophages and neutrophils, the cryosections of lungs or kidneys were 
first incubated with rat anti–mouse F4/80 antibodies (MCA497F; dilution, 
1:50; AbD Serotec) or rat anti-mouse neutrophils (MCA771G; dilution, 1:200; 
AbD Serotec), followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-rat IgG 
F(ab)′ 2 (dilution, 1:160) or FITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat IgG (dilution, 1:160) 
as secondary antibodies. The lung and kidney section from each mouse was 
viewed under ×400 magnification, and then macrophages or neutrophils were 
counted from 10 fields and averaged. Values are mean ± SD.
HMVEC-L culture and treatments. HMVEC-L were used for the in vitro assay 
because they have previously been shown to express ACE (56). HMVEC-L 
(Takara Bio Inc.) were cultivated in EGM-2MV BulletKit medium (Takara 
Bio Inc.) at 37°C in 5% CO2. HMVEC-L were grown as a monolayer in tissue 
culture plates coated with type I collagen. When the cells reached 70%–80% 
confluence, they were passaged with trypsin (0.025%)/EDTA (0.01%) and 
used within 4 passages, as recommended by the supplier. After reaching

confluence, HMVEC-L were washed with PBS and cultured for 24 hours 
in essential basal medium containing 0.5% FBS. These cells were exposed 
to 100 ng/ml recombinant human MK (rh-MK) plus 20 μg/ml heparin or 
50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) in essential basal medium containing 0.5% 
FBS. PMA and the PKC inhibitor stock solutions were made in dimethyl 
sulfoxide. For PKC inhibition, BIS (Calbiochem) was added 1 hour before 
treatment with rh-MK plus heparin or PMA. Protein was extracted from 
HMVEC-L at the indicated time points after treatment. Cells were then 
lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 1% Nonidet 
P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, and 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing 
0.25 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, kept on ice for 40 minutes, 
and then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants 
were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
Ang II concentration in HMVEC-L. After reaching confluence, HMVEC-L 
were washed with PBS and cultured for 24 hours in essential basal medium 
containing 0.5% FBS. These cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml rh-MK plus 
20 μg/ml heparin or 20 μg/ml heparin alone in essential basal medium 
containing 0.5% FBS for 36 hours. After stimulation, HMVEC-L were 
washed with PBS and exposed to 500 pM Ang I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 and 
25 minutes. Supernatants were collected into chilled tubes, and then the 
Ang II concentration was measured as previously described (57).
Western blot analysis. Mouse kidney, lung, brain, heart, and liver tissues 
were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein isolation. Western blot 
analysis was performed as described previously (58). The blots were subse￾quently incubated with goat anti–human MK antibody (dilution, 1:1,000), 
monoclonal anti–β-actin antibody (dilution, 1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich), 
mouse anti-ACE monoclonal antibody (dilution, 1:1,000; Chemicon 
International, Millipore), or rabbit anti–phospho-PKC antibody (dilution, 
1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), followed by incubation with peroxi￾dase-conjugated goat IgG, mouse IgG, or rabbit IgG (dilution, 1:5,000; 
Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.). Western blot analysis of 
liver ANG was performed using the ANG-specific polyclonal antibody as 
described previously (59). Proteins were visualized with an enhanced che￾miluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia, GE Healthcare). 
The density of each band was measured using the public domain NIH 
Image program (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/).
RNA preparation from mouse kidney and lung. Mouse kidney and lung tis￾sues (15 mg) were immersed in RNAlater (Ambion, Applied Biosystems) for 
1 day. The mixture was ground for 2 minutes with 5-mm tungsten carbide 
beads at a frequency of 20–25 Hz using a mixer-mill grinder according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions (Tissuelyser; QIAGEN). The ground solu￾tion was then centrifuged for 3 minutes at 10,000 g to compact the debris, 
and the supernatant was treated according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RNA 
concentrations were estimated using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3300 
pro; Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare).
Real-time PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Quanti￾Tect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions. One microgram of total RNA was then reverse 
transcribed. To validate changes in gene expression, we performed real￾time PCR analysis with an Applied Biosystems Prism 7500HT Sequence 
Detection System using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays according to 
the manufacturer’s specifications (Applied Biosystems). Two microliters 
of cDNA samples was used for the PCR reaction. The TaqMan probes and 
primers were as follows. For mouse MK: forward, 5′-CAAGGGACCCT￾GAAGAAGGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTTGGTCTTTGACTTGCTCTTGG-3′; 
for ANG: forward, 5′-CTCGAACTCAAAGCAGGAGAGG-3′, and reverse, 
5′-CGTAGATGGCGAACAGGAAGG-3′; for renin: 5′-TTGTTGCTCTG￾GAGTCCTTGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGGATTTCCCGGACAGAAGG￾3′; for ACE: forward, 5′-ACCCAACCTCGATGTCACCA-3′, and reverse, 
5′-GCGAGGTGAAGAATTCCTCTGA-3′; for Nox1: forward, 5′-TTG￾GCACAGTCAGTGAGGATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGATTTCAAGATG￾GAAGCAAAGGG-3′; for Nox2: forward, 5′-ACTTTCCATAAGATG￾GTAGCTTGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCATTCACACACCACTCAACG-3′; 
and for Nox4: forward, 5′-ACCAGAATGAGGATCCCAGAAAG-3′, and 
reverse, 5′-GTAGAAGCTGTAACCATGAGGAAC-3′. 18S ribosomal RNA 
(assay identification number 4326317E), which was used as an endog￾enous control, was as assay-on-demand gene expression product (Applied 
Biosystems). The thermal cycler conditions were as follows: hold for 
10 minutes at 95°C, followed by 2-step PCR consisting of 40 cycles at 
95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. The relative quantification of 
all targets was carried out using the comparative cycle threshold method 
(60). The levels of gene expression were standardized with those of the 
18S ribosomal RNA.
Statistics. Results are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical difference was 
assessed by a single-factor variance (ANOVA) followed by a 2-tailed unpaired 
t test, as appropriate. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
