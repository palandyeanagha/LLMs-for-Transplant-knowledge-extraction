EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DENTAL 
CARIES, WHAT HAVE WE 
LEARNED FROM THE PAST?
Throughout history dental caries has been 
a disease associated with wealth, as wealth 
meant the possibility to buy and consume 
luxury food. These were often rich in 
fermentable carbohydrates (sugars) and 
sugars were therefore considered the ‘arch 
criminals’ of the dentition. Dental caries 
is monitored by various parameters, such 
as the number of caries-free individuals 
at a given age or the number of decayed, 
filled or extracted teeth. The latter DMFT 
index (decayed missing filled teeth) is also 
reported at the level of the individual tooth 
surfaces and then referred to as DMFS. 
In the pre-fluoride era, DMFT values of 
15-year-olds typically averaged around 
10.1
 This value fell sharply after the wide￾spread use of fluoride products, initially 
INTRODUCTION
In the past decades fluoride toothpastes, 
rinses and other forms of fluoride delivery 
have become well established and these 
products are now being used by the major￾ity of our patients. Many discoveries have 
deepened our understanding of the mode 
of action of fluoride in caries prevention. 
This information has resulted in a more 
rational use of fluorides and tailored advice 
for specific patient groups. Although a lot 
has been achieved with fluoridated tooth￾pastes, there is still room for improvement 
regarding the effective delivery of fluoride 
in other vehicles. It is the aim of this article 
to describe the knowledge currently avail￾able on this topic and to suggest how this 
information could be used by clinicians to 
advise their patients on the ideal use of the 
currently available products. This article 
Dental caries has declined in the 40 years since fluoridated toothpastes were introduced. Much has been learned about 
why fluoride is so effective and how this knowledge can be used to optimise programmes for caries prevention. Fluoride 
works through enhancing the remineralisation of early stages of caries and by inhibiting demineralisation, which would 
lead to dental caries. Remineralisation involves the deposition of calcium phosphates from saliva to rebuild partly dis￾solved enamel crystallites. When fluoride is incorporated the dissolution of these reinforced crystallites will be reduced 
during a subsequent sugar-induced and bacteria-mediated acid attack. Fluoride works primarily when it is present in the 
oral cavity. Based on our understanding of the fluoride mode of action the following advice can be given from clinicians to 
their patients: The fluoride concentration in oral products is related to efficacy but the concentration does not necessarily 
need to be high to be efficacious. Fluoride availability throughout the day is important; this can be achieved when fluoride 
products are used as part of the daily hygiene routine (F-brushing or rinsing). Alternatively, when fluoride is provided in 
the drinking water or through professionally applied F‑varnishes or gels, the patient will benefit without requiring daily 
compliance to its use. The latter methods are particularly effective as additional treatments in high caries individuals.
in particular of fluoride toothpastes. The 
World Health Organization set a goal for 
2000 that a level of DMFT below one 
should be reached. This goal was reached 
or approached in many economically more 
developed countries, but not necessarily in 
economically less developed countries.2
 In 
addition a general observation has been 
that not everyone in society has benefited 
to the same extent from caries preventive 
programmes. Currently most of the dental 
decay is found in the socioeconomically 
lowest quartile of society. From a disease 
that was pandemic in society and where 
patients were happy to be provided with a 
denture early in life to be relieved of tooth 
ache, caries is now a disease affecting spe￾cific groups of individuals.
Where epidemiologic data projected a 
bright future for oral health, recent stud￾ies point to a stagnation of this improve￾ment and in several countries even a 
reversal.3
 Caries increases were reported 
for countries that initially showed the big￾gest improvements, such as Norway.4
 In 
the United Kingdom improvements were 
still found during the last decade,5,6 while 
in the United States oral health improved 
in adults but worsened in 2‑5-year-olds.7

PRACTICE
Given that information it is important to 
reconsider the established caries preven￾tion schemes aiming to optimise their ben￾efits. Any programme should be based on a 
comprehensive knowledge of the aetiology 
and pathogenesis of the disease and how 
preventative or curative medication may 
be effective.
FLUORIDE - WHAT DO WE KNOW 
ABOUT ITS ROLE AND IMPOR- TANCE IN CARIES PREVENTION?
The prevention of dental caries is uniquely 
associated with fluorides. Since the find￾ing of fluorosis in patients with low levels 
of decay in the 1930s, and the elaborate 
study of the causing factor, fluoride has 
been studied intensely both clinically and 
in laboratory experiments.8,9 It took consid￾erable efforts to formulate toothpastes con￾taining fluoride into efficacious products. 
Various randomised clinical trials (RCTs) 
have shown that proper formulation of a 
toothpaste is critical to achieving maximum 
efficacy. The caries reduction achieved by 
the regular use of fluoride toothpastes is 
now generally accepted, it is confirmed in 
multiple RCTs and documented in the pres￾tigious Cochrane library.10
Why is fluoride effective and what 
parameters determine the magnitude of its 
effect? To better understand this a small 
side step to describe why and how dental 
caries develops needs to be made.
DENTAL CARIES - 
HOW IS IT FORMED?
Dental caries is caused by the interplay of 
three factors: the presence of fermentable 
dietary sugars, bacteria present in dental 
plaque and obviously the availability of 
teeth. Numerous bacteria thrive in the oral 
cavity where they form a bacterial deposit 
onto the surfaces of the teeth. This dental 
plaque, now often called the dental biofilm, 
has properties similar to biofilms formed 
elsewhere in the body and in nature.11
Well-controlled biofilms serve many good 
purposes.12 However, when biofilms grow 
out of proportion on a tooth two processes 
may combine that can lead to tooth decay:
•	Bacteria use sugars to produce the 
matrix of the biofilm, which helps the 
bacteria to adhere to the surface and 
shield them from outside influences
•	Several bacteria metabolise sugars 
present in the diet and thereby form 
acids. During prolonged contact with 
these acids, the enamel or dentine in 
teeth will dissolve.
Like bone, teeth are formed from the 
calcium phosphate mineral hydroxyapa￾tite (HAP). The solubility of HAP depends 
on the pH (acidity, alkalinity), but also on 
the ionic-levels of the HAP components 
(calcium and phosphate) of the surround￾ing medium. Under physiological condi￾tions saliva and dental biofilms have a 
pH near neutrality (pH 7). The oral fluids 
contain ionic calcium and phosphates and 
their levels together with the pH determine 
whether a condition of so-called super‑
or under-saturation exists. In every day 
words this means whether a mineral will 
precipitate or dissolve. For the oral cavity 
this implies whether minerals form onto 
or inside the teeth, (as calculus or enamel 
crystallites) or, alternatively, enamel will 
dissolve. As mentioned above, sugars 
metabolised in oral biofilms form acids 
that dissolve hydroxyapatite.
Enamel is built from periodic ‘prismatic’ 
structures, each comprising millions of 
HAP crystallites. Together this creates a

Fig. 1 Schematic of cross section of tooth depicting structural changes occurring during 
tooth erosion, and de- and remineralisation (from left to right). With erosion an integral 
layer of enamel is removed by strong acids; this layer is not restored after the pH is returned 
to neutrality. In contrast, weak organic acids formed in dental plaque, when sugars are 
metabolized, lead to preferential dissolution in the spaces between the enamel prisms. These 
acids bypass the fluoride rich outer enamel layer. When pH return to neutrality calcium and 
phosphate ions from saliva can precipitate in these dissolved regions. In the presence of fluoride 
this leads to an enforced mineral, less susceptible to future acid attacks.

PRACTICE
mechanically strong structure that from a 
chemical point of view is rather vulnera￾ble. Due to porosities present in this struc￾ture, both between the enamel prisms and 
between the HAP crystallites, the ‘weak’ 
organic acids formed in the plaque will 
penetrate into enamel rather than dissolve 
the enamel layer by layer. In contrast, the 
latter occurs when enamel is etched by 
‘strong’ acids, such as phosphoric acid. 
The latter etching is common practice in 
the dental surgery to roughen enamel to 
create micro-retention required for seal￾ants or restorations. Penetration of acids 
will lead to selective dissolution inside 
the tooth, with the surface layer generally 
being bypassed as this is less soluble due 
to the accumulation of fluoride (Fig. 1). If 
this demineralisation process continues 
with thousands of acid challenges, the 
tooth gradually dissolves over an extended 
depth, while still maintaining overall 
integrity. However, when demineralisa￾tion extends to greater depth the overall 
structure might become too weak and the 
remaining tissue might collapse with a big 
cavity as a result! The described structural 
properties are not necessarily a shortcom￾ing, as new enamel may be formed in the 
demineralisation defects (‘white spots’) by 
the deposition of calcium- and phosphate￾ions from saliva, when the plaque pH has 
returned to neutrality. This natural repair 
mechanism is known as remineralisation. 
When fluoride ions are present during 
remineralisation, they become incorpo￾rated in the apatite structure, forming 
fluor-hydroxyapatite mixed crystals. As a 
result of the fluoride incorporation these 
newly formed or partly regrown crystal￾lites have a lower solubility than the origi￾nal ones. Moreover, in the presence of low 
fluoride levels this repair process is accel￾erated (Fig. 2). The ‘caries attack, crystallite 
dissolution and repair’ cycle will, in case 
of fluoride availability, result in repaired 
tooth enamel that is, in principle, slightly 
more resistant to future acid challenges 
(Fig. 3). However, the full story is more 
complicated, as will be described below.
WHY IS FLUORIDE EFFECTIVE 
IN INHIBITING DENTAL CARIES 
WITH REGULAR EXPOSURE?
Part of this question was already addressed 
in the preceding paragraph but the arse￾nal of fluoride’s mode of action in caries 
prevention is more elaborate. Numerous 
studies, particularly in the 1970‑90s have 
disclosed why fluoride is effective and how 
this information can be used to further 
develop products and concepts for caries 
prevention. The original understanding of 
the mode of action of fluoride was that 
if teeth would be loaded with fluoride, 
meaning fluoride incorporated into the 
crystalline structure, dental caries would 
not develop. This hypothesis was tested 
in a very ingenious experiment in which 
small pieces of dental enamel (‘chips’) 
were placed in dentures of volunteers who 
were asked to rinse with sucrose solutions 
to create highly cariogenic conditions.13
Obviously for ethical reasons this could 
not be done with volunteers still in pos￾session of their natural dentition. After 
several weeks the chips were removed 
and analysed with advanced microscopic 
techniques enabling the visualisation of 
decay long before it could be seen clini￾cally. The creative concept of this study 
was that not only human enamel was 
placed in the dentures, but also shark 
enamel which is composed of fluorapa￾tite, and secondly that volunteers were, in 
some experimental periods, asked to rinse 
with a 0.2% sodium fluoride solution. With 
this experimental design the investigators 
could discriminate between the contribu￾tion of fluoride present in the enamel (in 
the shark enamel group), and the avail￾able of fluoride in the oral fluid, on the 
initiation of tooth decay. The outcome was 
such that while there was some protec￾tion from tooth bound ‘intrinsic’ fluoride, 
the extrinsically provided fluoride was 
considerably more effective in preventing 
decay. Consequently, fluoridation of the 
enamel, with the aim of producing high 
levels of incorporated fluoride, was proven 
not to be a sufficient method to inhibit 
tooth decay. Clinically this is confirmed in 
patients that stop using fluoride products 
and develop tooth decay.14
This and other studies confirmed that a 
frequent exposure to fluoride products is 
more beneficial in caries prevention than 
the incorporation of fluoride into the den￾tal tissues, such as is achieved by semi￾annual topical fluoride treatments.
This paradigm shift paved the way for 
oral care products that lead to the eleva￾tion of the fluoride levels in the oral cavity, 
preferably several times during the day. It 
was found that this increase does not neces￾sarily have to be substantial. Studies where 
fluoride-slow-release-devices were placed in 
the mouth of high caries children confirmed 
that a relatively small increase in fluoride 
levels in oral fluids (in these studies from 
0.03 ppm to 0.11 ppm) gave 73% reduction

Fig. 3 Graph depicting the primary modes of action of fluoride: decreasing demineralisation 
and enhancing of remineralisation. Solubility of hydroxyapatite (HAP) depends on pH of the oral 
fluids (plaque). At physiological pH (6‑7), the calcium and phosphate levels are supersaturated 
with respect to HAP and can lead to remineralisation (green region). When acids are formed 
in the plaque, the pH decreases and beyond the critical pH this leads to dissolution of HAP 
(red region). This leads to an increase of the calcium and phosphate levels. When all sugars are 
metabolised and pH is increased due to salivary buffering (and HAP dissolution) the return part 
of the cycle is started. At some stage (see star) mineral will start to reprecipitate. The presence 
of fluoride leads to lower solubility (see yellow line), hence a lower (critical) pH at which 
dissolution starts, and a lower pH at which mineral reprecipitation occurs

of caries scores in deciduous and 64% car￾ies reduction in the permanent dentition.15
The fluoride levels in the oral cavity 
are generally relatively low as fluoride is 
cleared from the mouth due to salivary 
secretion and swallowing. Therefore the 
effect of fluoride after using oral care 
products on bacteria is limited. Bacterial 
growth and metabolism are affected by 
fluoride concentrations exceeding about 
10 ppm. Such fluoride levels are limited to 
a very short period after using a fluoride 
product. Fluoride containing products may 
be effective as antimicrobials but in those 
cases this is generally attributable to other 
components, such as the fluoride counter 
ions (amine, stannous), preservatives, sur￾factants or antimicrobials added specifi￾cally for that purpose (zinc salts, Triclosan, 
essential oil extracts, etc.).12 Regarding its 
mode of action in caries prevention the 
consensus today is that fluoride is mainly 
effective by enhancing the remineralisa￾tion of initial caries defects and by inhibit￾ing the demineralisation that would lead 
to caries initiation or progression. Fluoride 
thus shifts the ‘demin-remin balance’ from 
net demineralisation, in the case of caries 
active patients, towards net remineralisa￾tion.9
 It should be emphasised that fluoride 
is effective when present in the oral cavity 
and not after it has been swallowed.
CAN FLUORIDE BE STORED 
IN THE ORAL CAVITY?
Fluoride levels in saliva and biofilms decrease 
sharply with time after a topical application, 
rinsing or brushing with a fluoride dentifrice. 
Given this clearance the question is relevant 
how long the fluoride will be sufficiently 
elevated to benefit the de-/remineralisation 
processes. Data from a randomised clinical 
trial to evaluate dentifrices with various flu￾oride levels showed that even 18 hours after 
the last brushing, the fluoride concentrations 
in saliva and plaque reflected the dentifrice 
that had been used (Fig. 4). In saliva the 
fluoride concentration was increased from 
0.01 to 0.02 ppm and in plaque from 1.5 to 
2.4 ng F/mg wet weight for the 0 and 0.25% 
(2,500 ppm) fluoride dentifrice respectively. 
Also for the three products tested, contain￾ing 0.1% (1,000 ppm), 0.15% (1,500 ppm) 
and 0.25% (2,500 ppm) respectively, a dose 
response effect was found. These obser￾vations suggest the presence of fluoride 
reservoirs that are filled during the use of 
a fluoride product and which will subse￾quently slowly release its fluoride.16 Fluoride 
is present in dental plaque, often associated 
with mineral components such as early cal￾culus, but also adherent to the oral mucosa 
(Fig. 5).17 Particularly the mucosal surface 
is an underestimated fluoride retention site, 
which explains the high levels of salivary 
fluoride that can be achieved with fluoride 
rinses (100 ppm and above).18,19 Other fluo￾ride depots in the oral cavity are calcium 
fluoride (CaF2
) precipitates which forms 
after topical fluoride applications, but not 
during toothbrushing. These CaF2
 globules 
are protected from rapid dissolution by a 
phosphate-protein coating of salivary ori￾gin, which will open at low pH, when inci￾dentally the fluoride is most needed! Once 
again, the increase in bioavailable fluoride 
does not need to be substantial to have a 
favourable impact: even sub-ppm levels of 
fluoride have been shown to enhance rem￾ineralisation and inhibit demineralisation of 
enamel and dentine.9

PRACTICE
HOW DOES A FLUORIDE REGIME 
FIT IN THE PATIENT’S EVERY 
DAY LIFE?
Summarising the above it may be con￾cluded that effective caries preventive 
agents should be used daily. Various RCTs 
have reported that the level of caries pre￾vention resulting from using a fluoride 
product is related to the frequency of its 
use.20 Additionally it was found that it 
is better to not completely rinse out the 
mouth with large amounts of water after 
using a product, since the fluoride left in 
the oral cavity after brushing contributes 
to the overall caries preventive effect.20,21
A recent review by experts concluded that 
one of the following methods would lead 
to increased post-brushing fluoride reten￾tion: (a) spit and don’t rinse’, (b) rinse 
with a slurry of toothpastes with saliva 
and (c) rinse with a mouth rinse con￾taining fluoride. Each approach could be 
beneficial for caries control at the indi￾vidual level, although high level evidence 
from randomised clinical trials is not 
yet available.18
Oral care products were shown to be 
particularly efficacious when their use was 
appreciated and accepted by the patient. 
Compliance is a major determining fac￾tor for the success of these products. The 
success of fluoridated toothpastes was 
probably driven by the societal changes 
starting in the 1970s when personal 
hygiene and aesthetics gained importance 
in society. However, the currently chang￾ing lifestyle in many patients is creating a 
new challenge for oral care products and 
for dental practitioners. The number of 
snacks and meals consumed per day has 
increased substantially, reason why the 
current eating pattern is often referred 
to as ‘grazing’ rather than eating. With 
many of these consumptions being rich 
in carbohydrates, hence cariogenic (and 
not to forget acidified sugary soft drinks 
or sweet alcoholic beverages, which are 
typically consumed over extended peri￾ods) it is doubtful if fluoride is sufficiently 
powerful to counteract the increased 
cariogenic challenge.
Another very different challenge for the 
dental community and manufacturers of 
oral care products is the constant flow of 
critical and negative publications pertain￾ing to fluoride. Dental practitioners and 
personnel should be aware of this type 
of information that is available on pub￾lic media and therefore very accessible to 
patients. If, for whatever reason, patients 
stop or reduce the use of fluoride products, 
there is no question that this will lead to 
detrimental effects on the individual’s den￾tition. If a patient in your surgery shows 
a suddenly worsened dental situation, the 
possibility of a change in the used oral 
care products should be one of the first 
questions being asked.
A third risk factor in caries prevention is 
the latency of parents who have benefited 
from the use of fluoridated toothpastes 
but who are – not knowing the evil of 
serious decay – possibly less determined 
in monitoring brushing and snacking 
habits of their children. As an example, 
while cariogenic snacks were an official 
no-go to treat classmates in schools in 
the 1970‑80s, this seems to no longer be 
a rule in many schools.
HOW IS FLUORIDE DELIVERED 
IN THE ORAL CAVITY?
Fluoridated toothpastes are, without 
question, the corner stone of caries pre￾vention and largely responsible for its 
success. On average more than 95% of 
the population in economically more 
developed countries use a fluoridated 
toothpaste. The maximum allowed fluo￾ride level in toothpastes in Europe is 
0.15% (1,500 ppm), which is higher than 
the maximum content for toothpastes in 
the USA, being 0.11% (1,100 ppm). The 
acceptance, widespread use and proven 
efficacy of fluoridated toothpastes have 
encouraged manufacturers to also include 
other ingredients into toothpaste. These 
multifunctional toothpastes are aimed at 
preventing or curing a wide range of oral 
conditions besides tooth decay, such as 
periodontal infections, halitosis, dentinal 
hypersensitivity, staining and erosion. In 
the past decades fluoride toothpastes have 
been developed, with 0.28% (2,800 ppm) 
and 0.5% (5,000 ppm) fluoride. These are 
available on prescription or as over-the￾counter product, depending on the coun￾try. Fluoride toothpastes at 5,000 ppm 
were shown to be efficacious against 
root surface caries.22 Use of a 5,000 ppm 
F-paste gave significant additional car￾ies reduction over a 1,450 ppm F-paste, 
and the high fluoride paste was particu￾larly effective in subjects with irregular/
less frequent brushing habits.23 A high 
fluoride toothpaste might be suitable 
for patients with high caries challenges 
due to a cariogenic lifestyle.24 Although 
increasing the fluoride dose is a possibil￾ity, an advice to increase the frequency 
of brushing or other exposure such as 
rinsing is preferred. Obviously a more 
general advice, also in view of general 
health, would be to try to convert to a 
more healthy lifestyle.
Besides in toothpaste, fluoride has been 
studied when added to salt, milk, chewing 
gum and when supplied in rinses (discussed 
below) or tablets (for review see Tubert￾Jeannin et al.25). One of the benefits of 
such products is that they can also be used 
to bring fluoride into the mouth at times 
other than tooth brushing. Moberg Sköld 
et al.26 studied additional fluoride rinses 
and varnishes when given supervised in 
a school environment and observed that 
even in groups of adolescents with moder￾ate caries experience, caries initiation and 
progression were significantly reduced. 
An extensive Cochrane review, in which 
all published randomised clinical trial 
(RCT) data were combined, concluded 
that fluoride toothpastes, mouthrinses, 
gels and varnishes have a similar effec￾tiveness for preventing caries. In addition 
this meta-review confirmed that addi￾tional caries reduction is achieved when 
other fluoride sources are combined with 
fluoride toothpaste.27 A summary of RCTs 
on fluoride concentration in toothpastes 
showed a positive dose response: pastes 
with 1,000‑1,500 ppm F gave 23% car￾ies reduction compared to fluoride free 
placebo, this value increased to 36% for 
pastes at around 2,500 ppm. For pastes 
below 1,000 ppm no significant difference 
with placebo was found, probably due to 
the small number of studies. The advice 
was that the decision on which fluoride 
(level) toothpastes to be used by children 
under six years of age should be made bal￾anced with the risk of fluorosis. Hence this 
should be directed by factors like fluoride 
levels in the water supplies and other types 
of fluorides used. 
WHY SHOULD FLUORIDATED 
MOUTHRINSES BE USED?
More data on the efficacy of fluoride prod￾ucts are available from studies where only 
fluoride levels in saliva and plaque were

measured. While this is only a so called 
surrogate outcome measure it serves as a 
good indication how effective a particu￾lar regimen could be. Zero and colleagues 
performed various studies to compare flu￾oride and placebo toothpastes and rinses 
and reported that fluoride rinsing was in 
fact superior to fluoride tooth brushing, 
judging from the residual fluoride levels 
in both saliva and plaque.28 Obviously 
tooth brushing will remain necessary, 
irrespective of how poorly it is performed 
by the average patient in terms of plaque 
removal, as it is a habit that generally has 
a good compliance and delivers fluoride 
to the oral cavity. In studies with a simi￾lar design Duckworth et al.29 showed that 
rinsing with a fluoride free rinse decreased 
the fluoride levels in saliva. The preferred 
order of events would therefore be first 
tooth brushing, then additional cleaning 
of interdental spaces with floss or sticks 
followed by a fluoride rinse. Van Strijp 
et al.30 studied the benefits of an additional 
fluoride ‘moment’, using a fluoride rinse in 
addition to twice daily fluoride brushing. 
Such a routine was shown to benefit lesion 
remineralisation. An additional argument 
for using fluoride rinses to supplement the 
daily fluoride need is for patients that use 
electric toothbrushes, as they typically use 
a rather small quantity of toothpaste on 
the small brushes. Although not shown 
conclusively this might negatively impact 
the overall fluoride availability and ham￾per caries prevention.
A special case for fluoride rinses could 
be made for elderly patients. Often they 
take medication that affects salivary flow 
or they have a systemically impaired sali￾vary function. Moreover, tooth brushing 
may be physically difficult due to loss 
of dexterity, strenuous for the patients 
themselves or too time consuming, when 
done carefully, for those taking care of 
their hygiene. Toothpastes could also be 
too aggressive for sensitive mucosal tis￾sue, in particular when salivary function 
is reduced. Rinsing with an effective fluo￾ride rinse that lacks aggressive additional 
components, would then be a valuable 
method to provide sufficient amounts of 
fluoride throughout the day. One should 
remember that this will never be a full 
replacement for tooth brushing, consider￾ing the importance of tooth brushing for 
periodontal health.
ARE ALL FLUORIDES THE SAME?
Fluoride in toothpastes comes in vari￾ous chemical forms, as sodium fluoride, 
stannous fluoride, amine fluoride, mono￾fluorophosphate etc. The choice by manu￾facturers in the past was often related to 
compatibility with abrasive elements, price 
of components etc. Although differences in 
anti-caries performance were observed in 
standard RCTs,31 the conclusion is justified 
that these differences are small compared 
to patient variables such as brushing time, 
frequency and post-brushing behaviour.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
After the beneficial effects of fluorides in 
caries prevention were found in the 1930s 
major improvements have occurred in our 
understanding of the fluoride mode of 
action and this has resulted in new prod￾ucts. Currently we can choose from a range 
of fluoride toothpastes, rinses, gels and var￾nishes that have proven clinical efficacy. 
Fluoridated toothpastes are, by far, the most 
frequently sold and used method of car￾ies prevention. Given the fast clearance of 
fluoride after tooth brushing, the preferred 
order for fluoride delivery should, in my 
view, be brushing with a fluoridated tooth￾paste, additional cleaning of interdental 
spaces followed by using a fluoride rinse. 
The effectiveness of brushing and rinsing is 
very dependent on the patient’s compliance.
In patients where compliance is hard to 
achieve fluoride schemes should be cho￾sen that are efficacious without the coop￾eration of the patient. Fluoridation of the 
drinking water is still the optimal method 
of fluoride delivery but in many parts of 
the world this is not implemented due to 
political/emotional reasons. Alternatively, 
in high risk or non-compliant patients 
high fluoride gel and varnish treatments 
could be applied professionally.

Erratum
Research summary (BDJ 2013; 214: 66-67)
Summary of: Developing professional status: an investigation into the working patterns, working relationships and vision for 
the future of UK clinical dental technicians
In the above research summary the abstract originally published was incorrect. The abstract should have read as follows:
Aims To investigate the working patterns and patient base of registered clinical dental technicians (CDTs); their rela￾tionships with dentists and other professionals in the dental team; their willingness to work within the NHS and their 
expectations for the future as a new professional group.Methods Face-to-face qualitative interviews of registered CDTs, 
selected because of their geographic representation and mode of working, informed the development of a postal ques￾tionnaire survey of all early registrants with the General Dental Council (GDC). Results The majority of CDTs reported 
working part-time, often combining clinical practice with their role as a dental technician. They reported both positive 
and negative working relationships with dentists and dental technicians, demonstrating collaboration and/or competi￾tion depending on whether the scope of CDTs was respected and patient care was shared or lost. CDTs role in the NHS 
was limited because they did not have the status of becoming a recognised provider of dental care. There was a desire 
to expand their scope of practice in future. Conclusion CDTs are embracing their new status as an occupational group 
within dentistry. Core features of becoming a professional group were exhibited including the importance of social and 
financial status and the need to negotiate their current and future roles in the healthcare system.
