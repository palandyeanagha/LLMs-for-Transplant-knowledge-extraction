Animal viruses are broadly categorized structurally by the presence
or absence of an envelope composed of a lipid-bilayer membrane1
,
attributes that profoundly affect stability, transmission and immune
recognition. Among those lacking an envelope, the Picornaviridae
are a large and diverse family of positive-strand RNA viruses that
includes hepatitis A virus (HAV), an ancient human pathogen that
remains a common cause of enterically transmitted hepatitis2–4.
HAV infects in a stealth-like manner and replicates efficiently in
the liver5
. Virus-specific antibodies appear only after 3–4 weeks of
infection, and typically herald its resolution3,4. Although unex￾plained mechanistically, both anti-HAV antibody and inactivated
whole-virus vaccines prevent disease when administered as late as
2 weeks after exposure6
, when virus replication is well established
in the liver5
. Here we show that HAV released from cells is cloaked
in host-derived membranes, thereby protecting the virion from
antibody-mediated neutralization. These enveloped viruses (‘eHAV’)
resemble exosomes7
, small vesicles that are increasingly recognized
to be important in intercellular communications. They are fully infec￾tious, sensitive to extraction with chloroform, and circulate in the
blood of infected humans. Their biogenesis is dependent on host
proteins associated with endosomal-sorting complexes required for
transport (ESCRT)8
, namely VPS4B and ALIX. Whereas the hijacking
of membranes by HAV facilitates escape from neutralizing antibodies
and probably promotes virus spread within the liver, anti-capsid
antibodies restrict replication after infection with eHAV, suggesting
a possible explanation for prophylaxis after exposure. Membrane
hijacking by HAV blurs the classic distinction between ‘enveloped’
and ‘non-enveloped’ viruses and has broad implications for mecha￾nisms of viral egress from infected cells as well as host immune
responses.
Supernatant fluids of hepatoma cell cultures infected with low￾passage, non-cytopathic HAV9 (Fig. 1A) contain two populations of
virus particles that are resolved in isopycnic iodixanol gradients
(Fig. 1B). One bands at a low density consistent with membrane asso￾ciation (1.06–1.10 g cm23
, fractions 8–12) and is not detected in a
capsid antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
(Fig. 1C, left), whereas the other bands at the density expected for
picornaviruses (1.22–1.28 g cm23
, fractions 18–22) and is readily
detected by ELISA. Electron microscopy of the light fractions revealed
numerous virus-like particles enclosed in membranes (see a–d in
Fig. 1D, and Supplementary Fig. 1a) with morphology indistinguish￾able from ,27-nm HAV particles in dense fractions (see e in Fig. 1D).
These membrane-bound structures ranged from 50 to 110 nm in dia￾meter, a size similar to that of exosomes7
, and contained one to four
virus-like particles (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Consistent with this, viral
RNA banded in gradients with capsid protein (VP2) and the exosome￾associated protein flotillin-1 (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
A modified plaque assay (infrared fluorescence immunofocus assay;
IR-FIFA)10 revealed the membrane-wrapped particles to be infectious
(Fig. 1E) with a specific infectivity equivalent to that of virions
(Fig. 1F). Extraction with chloroform, a classic method for distinguish￾ing enveloped from non-enveloped viruses, had no effect on standard
virions but resulted in a 2log10 decrease in infectious virus in the light
fraction (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. 2a).We call these membrane￾wrapped HAV particles ‘enveloped HAV’ (eHAV). Capsid antigen
could be detected in the eHAV fraction after treatment with a nonionic
detergent (1% Igepal CA-630; NP-40) (Fig. 1C, right). This shifted the
viral particles to an intermediate density in iodixanol gradients (1.15–
1.17 g cm23
) but did not destroy infectivity (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c).
A potent, neutralizing, monoclonal antibody (mAb), K24F2 (ref. 11),
failed to neutralize eHAV (Fig. 1G), providing further evidence for
complete envelopment of the capsid.
In 12 experiments, eHAV represented 79 6 13% (mean 6 s.d.) of
virus in medium from infected cell cultures. eHAV was released from
multiple cell types and was also observed with high-passage cytopathic
virus (Supplementary Fig. 3a–e). Gradient-purified eHAV contained
mostly mature VP2 (Fig. 1H, lane 3, and Supplementary Fig. 2d),
indicating that enveloped virions had undergone maturation cleavage
of VP0 to VP4 1 VP2. However, whereas non-enveloped virions con￾tained fully processed VP1, eHAV contained primarily unprocessed
VP1pX (Fig. 1H; compare lanes 3 and 4). pX is an unusual 8-kDa
carboxy-terminal extension on VP1 that is unique to HAV among
picornaviruses (Fig. 1A). It functions in virion assembly and is pro￾cessed from VP1 by an unidentified host protease late in the viral
lifecycle12,13. pX was protected from proteinase K in eHAV particles,
but was rendered susceptible to digestion after treatment with NP-40
(Supplementary Fig. 2e). Thus, pX is fully enclosed in membranes. We
conclude that most HAV is released enveloped in host membranes, a
process we term ‘membrane hijacking’.
Infectious virus circulating in the blood of infected humans and
chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) possesses the buoyant density of
eHAV (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4a–e), confirming the rele￾vance of these observations to HAV pathogenesis. However, virus in
faeces is non-enveloped (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4c). Because
most faecal virus is produced in the liver14,15, the membrane may be
stripped from eHAV during passage through the biliary tract to the
gut. However, suspending eHAV in bile minimally altered its buoyant
density (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
It has been suggested16 that poliovirus, a distantly related picorna￾virus, could be released from cells wrapped in a single membrane if
entrapped in an autophagosome that fuses with the plasma membrane.
However, RNA-mediated interference knockdown of beclin-1, which
mediates autophagosome formation, did not inhibit eHAV release
(Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). In contrast, knockdown of VPS4B or

ALIX, which are ESCRT-III-associated proteins that facilitate the bud￾ding of many enveloped viruses17–20, inhibited the release of eHAV
from cells (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Figs 6c and 7a) but not viral
RNA replication (Fig. 3d), intracellular assembly of capsids or encap￾sidation of viral RNA (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). ESCRT complexes
act sequentially to sort and load cargo into multivesicular bodies
(MVBs)8
. VPS4B is an ATPase that provides energy for the dissolution
of ESCRT-III complexes at membrane fission, whereas ALIX
contributes to exosome biogenesis and also facilitates lentivirus
budding8,19,21. Knockdown of VPS4B and ALIX inhibited the release
of both enveloped and non-enveloped HAV (Fig. 3c), suggesting these
share a common egress pathway and that non-enveloped virus in
extracellular fluids might be derived from eHAV. Knockdown of
HRS and TSG101, which are ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I proteins involved
early in cargo recruitment, did not inhibit eHAV release (Fig. 3b, c).
Thus, eHAV release is dependent on ESCRT-associated proteins but
not on the entire ESCRT machinery, in a similar manner to the
budding of some enveloped viruses8,18. Although an interaction of
ALIX with the ESCRT-III protein CHMP4B facilitates the bud￾ding of human immunodeficiency virus22, CHMP4A, CHMP4B or
CHMP4C knockdown minimally decreased eHAV release (Sup￾plementary Fig. 8).
Structural proteins of enveloped viruses interact with ESCRT-related
proteins by means of Pro-rich late (‘L’) domain motifs: PPXY, P(S/T)AP
or (L)YPX1/3L (refs 8, 17). Only two domains in the 2,227-residue-long
HAV polyprotein conform to these motifs: conserved, tandem YPX3L
motifs separated by 28 residues in the VP2 capsid protein (Fig. 3e).
YPX1/3L motifs mediate interactions with ALIX (ref. 19), and their pres￾ence in VP2 is consistent with a requirement for ALIX. Disrupting either

YPX3L motif by substituting Ala for Tyr (Fig. 3e) severely decreased
virus release but did not impair viral RNA replication (Fig. 3f, g).
Intracellular capsid antigen was similarly decreased, suggesting that
the mutations impede capsid assembly, but the antigen was detected
in cells transfected with Y-A(II) RNA in which the second YPX3L motif
had been ablated (Fig. 3h). Limited capsid assembly was confirmed by
K24F2 precipitation of RNase-protected viral RNA from detergent￾treated cell lysates (Fig. 3i). Consistent with a role for ALIX in eHAV
biogenesis, anti-ALIX antibody precipitated encapsidated (RNase￾protected) viral RNA from lysates of cells transfected with wild-type,
but not Y-A(II), RNA (Fig. 3i). Furthermore, ALIX banded at the same
density as eHAV in iodixanol gradients (Supplementary Fig. 7d).
Although details remain to be worked out, these data suggest that
HAV co-opts ALIX to facilitate its envelopment in host membranes.
Where this occurs is uncertain, but HAV particles have been observed
within cytoplasmic vesicles in infected liver14,23.
The cloaking of its capsid by membranes allows eHAV to evade
neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig. 9a) and
explains how infectious virus co-exists with anti-HAV in serum15.
However, antibodies protect against hepatitis A when passively trans￾ferred after HAV replication has been well established in the liver5,6.
We therefore reasoned that eHAV might be neutralized after binding
to or entering hepatocytes. Consistent with this, eHAV was neutralized
when cells were exposed to antibody either immediately before inocu￾lation with virus or up to 6 h afterwards (Fig. 4a, b). IgG and IgA anti￾capsid mAbs neutralized eHAV when added to cultures after removal
of the inoculum, but an IgM mAb, H14C42 (ref. 11), failed to do so
despite potent neutralizing activity against non-enveloped HAV (Sup￾plementary Fig. 9b). Taken together, these results show capsid is the
target for neutralization and that eHAV membranes must rupture
before neutralization, but not before eHAV is internalized and inac￾cessible to H14C42 in the medium. This suggests that eHAV may be
neutralized after endocytosis. Chloroquine efficiently blocked infec￾tion by eHAV (but not by non-enveloped HAV) (Fig. 4c), indicating
that endosomal acidification is important for eHAV entry, whereas
an antibody against the HAV receptor, TIM-1 (HAVCR-1)24, inhi￾bited both (Fig. 4d). We found eHAV membranes to be stable at
pH 5.0 (Supplementary Fig. 5b), but they could nonetheless be
degraded in late endosomes and lysosomes25. If so, this would render
the capsid accessible to TIM-1, which undergoes constitutive endocy￾tosis and trafficking to late endosomes and lysosomes26, as well as to
anti-HAV. Many details of eHAV entry and neutralization remain to
be explained. However, TRIM-21 (tripartite motif-containing 21),
which is implicated in intracellular neutralization of other viruses27,
seems to have no function in neutralization of eHAV (Supplementary
Fig. 9c).

Our findings show how a ‘non-enveloped’ picornavirus promotes its
egress in the absence of cell lysis, and reveal a previously unrecognized
strategy by which a virus cloaks itself in host membranes to evade
neutralizing antibodies. The host membrane enveloping eHAV is
likely to facilitate its spread within the liver. Antibodies restrict the
replication of eHAV when added to cultures several hours after infec￾tion, but further studies will be needed to determine how this happens
and whether this can explain why immune globulin and vaccines
protect against hepatitis when administered long after exposure, when
virus is already circulating in blood5
. Our results suggest that categori￾zing viruses into those that are enveloped and those that are not, long a
tradition in virology1
, is overly simplistic, and that efforts should be
made to identify other examples of membrane hijacking by ‘non￾enveloped’ viruses.
METHODS SUMMARY
Non-cytopathic, cell-culture-adapted HM175/p16 HAV9 was propagated in Huh￾7.5 cells. Reverse molecular genetics studies were performed with pHM175/18f, a
molecular clone of a related cytopathic variant28. Buoyant density was assessed in
8–40% iodixanol (Opti-Prep) gradients centrifuged at 141,000g for 48 h at 4 uC.
Viral RNA was measured by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (qRT–
PCR) with primers targeting the 59 untranslated region. Infectivity was quantified
by IR-FIFA10. For RNA-mediated interference studies, cells were transfected with
SmartPool short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Dharmacon) and samples were
collected 48–72 h later for viral RNA quantification. To analyse VP2–ALIX inter￾actions, cell lysates were prepared 48 h after electroporation of mutant and wild￾type viral RNAs, treated with RNase and immunoprecipitated. RNA extracted
from immunoprecipitates was assayed by HAV-specific qRT–PCR. For intracel￾lular neutralization, cells were incubated with eHAV for 1 h at 37 uC, then washed
extensively. Antibodies were added at intervals, and intracellular and extracellular
HAV RNA was quantified at 48–72 h. For standard neutralization assays, virus was
incubated with antibodies for 1 h at 37 uC, then inoculated onto cells for IR-FIFA10.

a, Neutralization of eHAV in cells treated with anti-HAV before (pre) or after
(post) adsorption of virus. Left, intracellular; right, extracellular. Pretreated cells
were incubated with JC plasma (1:50–1:100) for 1 h, washed extensively with
PBS, then incubated with gradient-purified eHAV (multiplicity of infection
about 6) for 1 h in the absence of antibody. For post-treatment, JC was added to
the medium on refeeding after removal of the inoculum. Cells were
subsequently re-fed at 24 h intervals with fresh medium containing no
antibody. Data are means 6 s.e.m. from duplicate cultures and are
representative of six independent experiments. b, Adding anti-HAV to
medium as late as 6 h after removal of the inoculum restricts the replication of
eHAV (left) but not that of non-enveloped HAV (right). JC antibody was added
at intervals after removal of the inoculum, and intracellular viral RNA was
quantified at 48 h. Results are means 6 s.e.m. of replicate RT–PCR assays and
are representative of three independent experiments. c, Chloroquine (50 mM)
blocks eHAV entry but not HAV entry. Cells were treated for 30 min before
inoculation with virus, and were harvested at 48 h to assay intracellular HAV
RNA. d, Anti-TIM-1 mAb 190-4 blocks entry of both eHAV and HAV. GL37
cells were incubated with 190-4 (10–100 mg ml21
) or control IgG (100 mg ml21
)
for 1 h at 37 uC, then inoculated with virus for 1 h. Intracellular HAV RNA was
assayed at 72 h. RT–PCR data are means 6 s.e.m. for two or three replicate
assays; all results are representative of two or three independent experiments.

METHODS
Reagents and antibodies. Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma unless
otherwise noted. A human convalescent plasma (JC plasma) sample with high￾titre anti-HAV antibody, collected 90 days after the onset of acute hepatitis A, was
described previously11,29. Other antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-TSG101
(Abcam), anti-HRS (Bethyl), anti-ALIX (Pierce and Bethyl), anti-VPS4B (Sigma),
anti-beclin-1 (Cell Signaling), anti-flotillin-1 (BD Biosciences) and anti-HAV
mAbs K24F2 and K32F2 (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Victoria,
Australia). The sources of other anti-HAV mAbs have been described previously11.
Anti-TIM-1 mAb 190-4 was a gift from G. Kaplan. Guinea-pig anti-peptide
antibodies against HAV VP1 (residues 211–228) and VP2 (residues 240–259)
were a gift from D. Sangar.
Cells and viruses. Huh-7.5 and HepG2 (both human hepatoma cells), MRC-5
(human lung fibroblasts), FRhK-4 (fetal rhesus monkey kidney cells), BS-C-1 and
GL37 (ref. 30) (both African green monkey kidney) cells were cultured in DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cell-culture adapted variants of the HM175
strain of HAV, HM175/p16 (refs 9, 31) (non-cytopathic) and HM175/18f (refs 28,
32) (rapidly replicating, cytopathic), have been described previously9,32. Infectious
virus titres were determined by a modification of the IR-FIFA described previously10
performed in FRhK-4 cells.
Human samples and clinical information. All human samples and related clini￾cal information were obtained with the approval of the Institutional Review
Boards of the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Chimpanzee samples. All chimpanzee materials were archived samples collected
during previous studies5 conducted prior to 15 December 2011.
HAV capsid antigen ELISA assay. HAV capsid antigen was detected with an
ELISA modification of a previously described radioimmunoassay33. Immobilized
antigen captured by JC antibody was detected by sequential incubation of ELISA
plates with K24F2 (1:1,000 dilution) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat￾anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000) at room temperature (20–23 uC) for 1 h each.
After washing with PBS-T and substrate (3,39,5,59-tetramethylbenzidine) addi￾tion, D450 was determined with a Synergy 2 (BioTek) microplate reader.
qRT–PCR assay for HAV RNA. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cell
lysates with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen); RNA from culture supernatants and gra￾dient fractions was extracted with the QiaAmp viral RNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen).
HAV RNA was quantified by real-time qRT–PCR against a synthetic RNA stand￾ard as described previously5
. Intracellular viral RNA was normalized to total RNA
abundance or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA level deter￾mined in a SYBR green one-step qRT–PCR assay (Bio-Rad). For experiments
involving electroporation of synthetic viral RNAs, a two-step qRT–PCR procedure
was conducted in which complementary DNA was synthesized with (dT)20 as
primer, followed by RNaseH digestion and qPCR assay with primers targeting the
HAV 59 untranslated RNA segment.
Virus neutralization. To assess eHAV neutralization following binding or entry
of eHAV into cells, Huh-7 cells (FT3-7 subline) were incubated with gradient￾purified eHAV for 1 h at 37 uC, then washed extensively and refed with fresh
medium. Antibodies were added at intervals, and intracellular and extracellular
HAV RNA was quantified 48–72 h after virus inoculation. For standard neutral￾ization assays, virus was incubated with antibodies for 1 h at 37 uC, then inoculated
onto FRhK-4 cells which were processed subsequently for IR-FIFA10.
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed with CelLytic Lysis Buffer (Invitrogen) in the
presence of protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Proteins were extracted from
gradient fractions by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Immunoblots were
performed with standard procedures and the indicated antibodies. Protein bands
were detected with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Huh-7.5 cells seeded on four-well chamber
slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton
X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 10% goat serum. Cells were then incubated with
mAb K24F2 (1:300 dilution in 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and
incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody
(1:300; Southern Biotech) for 1 h. Images were collected with a Zeiss 510 Meta
laser-scanning confocal microscope.
Isopycnic gradient centrifugation of virus. Cell-culture supernatant fluids were
centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min at 4 uC to remove cells and debris, further clarified
by centrifugation twice at 10,000g for 30 min, and concentrated by ultracentrifu￾gation at 100,000g for 1 h at 4 uC. The resulting pellet was resuspended in PBS,
loaded onto a 8–40% iodixanol (Opti-Prep) step gradient, and centrifuged at
141,000g in a Superspin 630 rotor for 48 h at 4 uC in a Sorvall Ultra-80 ultracen￾trifuge. Approximately 20 fractions were collected from the top of the gradient;
density was determined with a refractometer.
Rate-zonal centrifugation of HAV in sucrose gradients. Lysates were prepared
from HAV (HM175/p16)-infected Huh-7.5 cells, loaded onto a 7.5–45% (w/v)
sucrose gradient in Hank’s balanced buffer, and centrifuged at 4 uC in a Beckman
SW55i rotor for 3 h at 42,000 r.p.m. (167,000g). Fractions were assayed by HAV
antigen ELISA and HAV RNA-specific qRT–PCR to identify pentamers, procap￾sids and mature HAV virions.
Immunoprecipitation of HAV. Cells (23 106
) were lysed in the presence of
detergent with CelLytic lysis buffer (Invitrogen), treated with 50 mg ml21 RNase
A (Qiagen) and 25 U ml21 RNase T1 (Ambion) at 37 uC for 15 min, and incubated
overnight with antigen-specific and isotype-matched antibodies at 4 uC. Protein G
beads were added and incubated for a further 2 h. Beads were extensively washed
with lysis buffer, and captured immunoprecipitates were subjected to RNA extrac￾tion for qRT–PCR, or immunoblotting, as above.
Virus isolation from iodixanol gradient fractions. Huh-7.5 cells in 12-well
culture plates were inoculated with 10–100 ml of peak iodixanol gradient fractions
containing eHAV recovered from human or chimpanzee serum or plasma. Cells
were re-fed weekly, and split 1:3 at 2 weeks. RNA was extracted from supernatant
culture fluids 8, 23 and 30 days after inoculation and assayed for HAV RNA by
qRT–PCR as described above. To confirm viral isolates, RNA was extracted from
supernatant culture fluids with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), and
cDNA was transcribed with random primers (Superscript III First-Strand
Synthesis System; Invitrogen). HAV cDNA was amplified by nested RT–PCR with
primer sets bracketing the VP1pX-2B junction (nucleotides 2908–3306 in wild￾type HM-175) (PrimeSTAR; TaKaRa). Second-round PCR products were isolated
from agarose gels (Mini-Elute Gel Extraction Kit; Qiagen) and directly sequenced.
Generation and characterization of HAV VP2 mutants. Mutagenesis of the
infectious cDNA clone, pT7-HM175/18f, containing the complete sequence of
HM175/18f virus28, was accomplished with the Quick Change II Site-directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). PCR-derived fragments were sequenced to ensure
sequence fidelity. Plasmids were linearized and viral RNA was synthesized with
the T7 Megascript Kit (Ambion). Synthetic viral RNA (10 mg) was mixed with
5 3 106 Huh-7.5 cells in a 4-mm cuvette and pulsed once at 250 V, 950 mF and
100 V in a Gene Pulser Xcell Total electroporation system (Bio-Rad). Cells and
supernatants were harvested at subsequent intervals for RNA extraction and qRT–
PCR assay.
Electron microscopy. Gradient fractions (2.5 ml each) were spread onto the sur￾face of a glow-discharged 400 mesh Formvar/carbon-coated copper grid and
allowed to adsorb for 5 min. The grid was inverted onto a droplet of 1% glutar￾aldehyde in 0.15 M sodium phosphate pH 7.4 for 1 min, followed by rinsing with
deionized water and staining with 3% ammonium molybdate pH 7.0. The grid was
air-dried before examination in a LEO EM910 transmission electron microscope
(Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc.) operating at 80 kV. Digital images were acquired with a
Gatan Orius SC1000 CCD Digital Camera and Digital Micrograph 3.11.0 software
(Gatan, Inc.).
siRNA knockdown of protein expression. Huh-7.5 cells were transfected with
gene-specific SmartPool siRNAs (Dharmacon; see Supplementary Table 1) with
SilentFect (Bio-Rad) transfection reagent. Knockdown efficiency was determined
at 48–72 h by qRT–PCR (SYBR Green One-step qRT–PCR Kit; BioRad) measure￾ment of mRNAs, or by immunoblotting as described.
