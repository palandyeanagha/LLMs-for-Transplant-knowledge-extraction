Hyperammonemia due to urea cycle disorders:
a potentially fatal condition in the intensive
care setting
Marcel Cerqueira Cesar Machado1,2* and Fabiano Pinheiro da Silva1,2
Abstract
Disorders of the urea cycle are secondary to a defect in the system that converts ammonia into urea, resulting in
accumulation of ammonia and other products. This results in encephalopathy, coma, and death if not recognized
and treated rapidly. Late-onset urea cycle disorders may be precipitated by acute disease and can be difficult to
recognize because patients are already ill. Diagnosis of urea cycle disorders is based on clinical suspicion and
determination of blood ammonia in suspected patients with neurological symptoms in the intensive care setting.
Treatment is based on the removal of ammonia by dialysis or hemofiltration, reduction of the catabolic state,
abolishment of nitrogen administration, and use of pharmacological nitrogen scavenging agents.

Introduction
Recently, we reported a case of a 49-year-old man with
biliary acute pancreatitis who developed high fever and a
large pancreatic abscess. Upon admission, this patient
underwent necrosectomy, cholecystectomy, and abscess
drainage in a single surgical setting. Parenteral nutrition
was initiated, but on the 8th day, the patient developed
progressive lethargy, confusion, and coma, requiring in￾tubation. Computed tomography and magnetic reson￾ance imaging showed no brain lesions. Laboratory tests
indicated normal liver function, with enzyme levels and
serum bilirubin within the normal range. The etiology of
the encephalopathy was not suspected until hyperammo￾nemia (137 μ/L) was observed. Lactulose treatment pro￾duced no improvement in clinical signs, and the patient
remained in a deep coma, with ammonia levels elevated
up to 254 μ/L. Because there was no evidence of liver
disease, hyperammonemia must have been caused by a
metabolism disorder. To deal with these types of cases,
physicians need to understand the principles of the
pathophysiology of ammonia metabolism and how to
treat these patients in the intensive care setting.
Review
Ammonia metabolism
The urea cycle is the only effective system that converts
waste nitrogen from protein intake and the breakdown
of endogenous protein (catabolism) into urea, which is
excreted from the body. This system consists of five con￾secutive enzymatic reactions that convert one molecule
of nitrogen from ammonia, two molecules of nitrogen
from ornithine, and one molecule from aspartate to urea
in each cycle (Figure 1). There is also a cofactor-producing
enzyme (N-acetyl glutamate synthetase) and two trans￾porters (ornithine transporter-1 and citrin) that are
involved in the urea cycle.
Disorders of the urea cycle are the result of total or par￾tial deficiency in any of the factors mentioned (Figure 1).
This leads to defects in the metabolism of waste products
from breakdown of protein and other nitrogen-containing
substances, with accumulation of ammonia and other
products [1,2]. The most common presentation of these de￾fects is in newborns who typically present with somnolence,
poor feeding, hyperventilation, and seizures, followed by
lethargy and coma [3]. However, there are several reports
concerning urea cycle disorders (UCDs) that manifest in

adulthood, mainly in the presence of an acute injury [2].
In most cases in the intensive care setting, underlying
UCDs are difficult to recognize because patients are in a
critical condition for other reasons. There is also an insuf￾ficient awareness of medical staff because of the rarity of
this disease and because the plasma ammonia levels are
not routinely determined. Prompt diagnosis and treatment
of this disorder are required to avoid death or severe
neurological damage.
In the last few decades, there has been a dramatic im￾provement in the recognition and treatment of UCDs
[3-7]. In partial deficiency of urea cycle enzymes, symp￾toms may develop late in life. These symptoms are fre￾quently triggered by acute stress or illness, such as
sepsis, surgery, trauma, or drugs (e.g., valproic acid), be￾cause of their effect on the function of the enzyme car￾bamoyl phosphate synthetase-1 (CPS-1) [2] especially in
patients on parenteral nutrition [8]. In these situations,
elevation of blood ammonia and symptoms may be sub￾tle or occur acutely only during metabolic decompensa￾tion related to catabolic stress, such as in surgery, sepsis,
or hemodynamic alterations. Recognition and treatment
are crucial to improve the outcome of UCDs. Ammone￾mia may be normal when an individual is healthy. We
present here a review of the clinical features, diagnosis,
and treatment of these disorders in late-onset diseases
related to partial enzyme deficiency decompensated by
acute stress.
Partial UCDs or late-onset UCDs
Patients with partial deficiency of any enzyme in the
urea cycle may develop symptoms at any time of life, usu￾ally as a result of increased catabolic stress [9,10]. Partial
enzyme deficiency allows a patient to have a normal life
for decades before there is increased production of ammo￾nia or interference with any enzyme of the urea cycle. In
patients with partial urea cycle enzyme deficiency, symp￾toms may be delayed for months or years and vary with
the specific enzyme deficiency. In most hyperammonemic
episodes, patients may present with a loss of appetite,
vomiting, lethargy, and behavior abnormalities associated
with hallucinations, sleep disorders, ataxia, and even sei￾zures. These episodes are usually related to periods of high
protein intake, systemic infection, or catabolic stress. In
the intensive care unit, patients with acute neurological
and psychiatric symptoms or coma should have plasma
ammonia levels measured to disclose a possible late-onset
UCDs if there is any suspicion. Prompt diagnosis of UCDs
is essential for treatment to be effective; otherwise, the
prognosis of these patients is poor. UCDs are usually diffi￾cult to recognize because many of these patients are
frequently ill for other reasons, such as sepsis, acute pan￾creatitis, trauma, or other acute diseases. Plasma ammonia
determination is carried out in venous or arterial blood
collected in chilled tubes with ammonia-free sodium hep￾arin or EDTA tubes placed on ice. These are immediately
sent to the laboratory because hemolysis, an increase in
temperature, and delays in processing may falsely increase
plasma ammonia levels (normal levels less than 30 μ/L).
An elevated plasma ammonia level is associated with nor￾mal blood glucose levels. A normal anion gap suggests
UCDs because hyperammonemia associated with hyper￾glycemia and an abnormal anion gap are found in organic
acidemias (a different inborn error of metabolism). Plasma
and urine must be frozen for future diagnostic tests to
identify the specific enzyme deficiency. The following

are the conditions that may induce hyperammonemia
in partial UCDs:

Neurological disorders in UCDs
Hyperammonemia may damage the brain by a variety of
mechanisms. The most important mechanism is brain
edema, probably induced by disruption of the aquaporin
system (membrane water channels) and brain electrolyte
homeostasis. The central feature of hyperammonemia￾induced encephalopathy is an increase in astrocytes glu￾tamine synthesis, and swelling of astrocytes in response
to the osmotic effect of glutamine accumulation, result￾ing in increased intracranial pressure [11]. A recent
study using N-ammonia positron emission tomography
suggested that the magnitude of the flux of ammonia
from the blood into intracellular glutamine in the brain
is primarily correlated with blood ammonia concentra￾tions [12]. In infancy, brain damage in acute hyperam￾monemia is similar to that seen in hypoxic-ischemic
situations, with white matter disruption and lacunar in￾farcts. Brain damage due to hyperammonemia may re￾sult in seizures and coma [13]. Subclinical seizures are
common in acute hyperammonemia and may be consid￾ered in the treatment of these conditions. In many cases,
modern imaging techniques may provide information re￾lated to the extent and intensity of brain injury. How￾ever, routine neurological images may not detect brain
damage [14]. Newer technologies, such as magnetic reson￾ance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and func￾tional magnetic resonance may provide information about
the many types of neurological damage seen in UCDs.
Therapy of a rapid decrease in plasma ammonia
concentrations to normal levels
In patients, including the one we recently reported, with
high ammonia plasma levels higher than 100 μ/L, the first
option is to decrease plasma ammonia levels by using an
extracorporeal therapy to achieve a rapid reduction in
plasma ammonia levels. Renal replacement therapy (RRT)
allows efficient removal of toxic metabolites, minimizing
the duration of the metabolic disturbance. The use of RRT
has changed since the studies of Donn et al. [15], conclud￾ing that hemodialysis is the preferred modality for the
treatment of hyperammonemia secondary to UCDs. Cur￾rently, the choice of treatment for hyperammonemia is
hemodialysis or continuous RRT, or even both modalities
as early as possible [16-18]. The clearance of ammonia
and other low-molecular-weight toxins is much greater
with hemodialysis than with other RRTs [16,17,19].
Hemodialysis is the first-line therapy for the initial
treatment of hyperammonemia in UCDs. Because am￾monia is a gas, its rapid removal by hemodiafiltration
is not associated with osmotic problems, and no special
care must be taken to avoid dialysis disequilibrium syn￾drome [17,18]. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective for this
purpose and should not be used. Hemodialysis may be
discontinued when plasma levels fall below 80 μ/L. How￾ever, clinical evaluation is the best parameter to be used
for discontinuation of dialysis. Patients with severe en￾cephalopathy from acute hyperammonemia may com￾pletely recover unless prolonged cerebral edema results in
cerebral damage [11]. In fact, in our patient, 36 h after
continuous hemofiltration, ammonia levels had decreased
to 82 μ/L, with improvement in the patient's mental sta￾tus. The patient was weaned from the respirator and be￾came completely awake. Rebound hyperammonemia with
clinical worsening may also occur, requiring further dialy￾sis. In our patient, discontinuation of hemofiltration was
accompanied by deterioration in the patient's mental
status. Any oral or parenteral protein administration must
be immediately discontinued when hyperammonemia is
detected.
Pharmacological treatment
Nitrogen scavenger therapy
Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate, or sodium
phenylbutyrate, are available for intravenous or oral ad￾ministration. The basis for use of these drugs was estab￾lished by Brusilow et al. [20] in 1979, who proposed the
use of alternative pathway treatment to reduce ammonia
plasma levels in UCDs. Alternative pathway treatment
diverts nitrogen from the urea cycle to alternative routes
of excretion. Sodium phenylacetate combines with glu￾tamine, producing phenylacetylglutamine. Phenylacetyl￾glutamine is excreted by the kidneys and sodium benzoate
conjugates with glycine, producing sodium hippurate,
which is also excreted by the kidneys [21].
Replacement of deficient urea cycle intermediates
Arginine administration in patients without a definitive
diagnosis of the specific type of UCD is also important be￾cause ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) is the most com￾mon type of late-onset UCDs [2,20,22]. Low plasma
arginine levels observed in patients with OTC deficiency
may also be related to increased vascular thrombosis [23].
To prevent future episodes of hyperammonemia, plasma
ammonia should be maintained below 80 μ/L, glutamine
below 1,000 μ/L, and arginine between 80 and 150 μ/L
[14]. In our patient, we administered sodium benzoate
(3 g) and arginine (3 g) every 4 h via a nasogastric tube,
maintaining plasma ammonia levels within the normal
range. Recently, it was found that glycerol phenylbutyrate,

which has excellent pharmacokinetics, controls plasma
ammonia, improving executive function in adult and
pediatric patients [24].
Reduction of protein catabolism
Restriction of protein intake for a period of 24 to 48 h
and administration of calories from glucose and fat are
important in patients on hemodialysis or hemofiltration
for the prevention of an excessive catabolic state. Main￾tenance of adequate plasma levels of essential amino
acids is also necessary to avoid the catabolic state. Low￾dose continuous infusion of insulin with glucose may be
used to potentially alleviate the catabolic state.
Liver transplantation
Liver transplantation is considered only in patients with
recurrent hyperammonemia or in those resistant to con￾ventional medical therapy. The decision for liver trans￾plantation is also based on the extent of brain and liver
damage.
Diagnosis, genetic tests, and differential diagnosis of UCDs
The elevation in plasma ammonia concentrations is the
main alteration in UCDs. Normal ammonia levels in
adults are less than 30 μ/L. Quantitative plasma amino
acid concentrations are used to determine specific en￾zyme deficiency in UCDs (Table 1). Plasma levels of cit￾rulline can be used to evaluate the type of UCD and to
separate proximal from distal urea cycle defects. Plasma
citrulline levels are absent or present in trace amounts
in CPS-1 deficiency and in low, or even normal, concen￾trations in late onset of OTC deficiency. Plasma citrul￾line levels are present in high concentrations (tenfold) in
argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency. Moderate
elevation in plasma citrulline levels is seen with argini￾nosuccinic acid lyase deficiency, accompanied by an ele￾vation in argininosuccinic acid in plasma and urine
(Table 1). Plasma concentrations of arginine are reduced
in every type of UCD, except in arginase deficiency (ele￾vation five to sevenfold). In late onset or in partial en￾zyme defects, arginine concentrations may be normal.
Plasma concentrations of glutamine, asparagine, and ala￾nine are elevated in UCDs.
Urine concentrations of orotic acid help to distinguish
CPS-1 deficiency from OTC deficiency because they are
normal or low in CPS-1 deficiency and elevated in OTC
deficiency. Urinary orotic acid concentrations are also el￾evated in arginase deficiency and in citrullinemia type 1
deficiency (Table 1). Diagnosis may be further refined by
enzyme analysis in appropriate tissues as follows: liver
biopsy (CPS-1, N-acetyl glutamate synthetase, and OTC
deficiencies); red blood cells (arginase deficiency); and fi￾broblasts (skin biopsy, argininosuccinic acid synthetase
and argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiencies).
Genetic tests
There are several genetic tests available for the diagnosis
of UCDs. In late-onset hyperammonemia, DNA testing
for OTC deficiency should be the first test for evaluation
because this is the most common type of late-onset
UCD, and many mutations have been described in this
condition. Recently, a more sophisticated DNA mutation
analysis has been introduced, which allows identification
of variants in most coding genes [25].
Differential diagnosis of UCDs
Several disorders disturbing liver function may mimic
UCDs. These include hepatic encephalopathy in patients
with advanced liver disease, vascular bypass of the liver,
valproic acid or cyclophosphamide poisoning, herpes sim￾plex infection, and gastrointestinal bacterial overgrowth.
In the last two conditions, the plasma ammonia levels are
usually moderately elevated. A number of inborn errors of
metabolism may also cause hyperammonemia:
 Tyrosinemia type 1
 Galactosemia
 Mitochondrial disorders
 Fatty acid oxidation disorders
 Citrin deficiency leading to citrullinemia type II
(CTLN2) and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis
caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD)
Citrin deficiency (CTLN2) is a late-onset disorder
characterized by recurrent periods of hyperammonemia,
delirium, irritability, and liver fatty infiltration, but there
is no hepatic dysfunction. Citrin is an aspartate glutam￾ate transporter across the mitochondrial membrane [2].
Citrin deficiency leads to a decrease in cytoplasmic as￾partate, limiting the activity of the enzyme argininosuc￾cinic acid synthase [2].
Diagnosis of this alteration is based on findings of
hyperammonemia and increased plasma concentrations
of citrulline and arginine. SLC25A13 is a gene mutated
in patients with citrin deficiency. Ornithine translocase
deficiency is a rare disease that results in hyperornithi￾nemia, homocitrullinuria, and hyperammonemia, similar
to those in UCDs. A reduction in ornithine transport
into the mitochondria results in orotic aciduria and

deficiency of urea synthesis. In this situation, plasma
levels of ornithine are high and can be reduced by a
low-protein diet. Citrin deficiency and hyperammonemia
may be included in UCDs as transporter defects. There￾fore, UCDs is related to eight defects, with deficiencies
in six enzymes and two transporters.
Conclusions
Hyperammonemia in an acutely ill patient can cause irre￾versible neurological damage, or even death, if not recog￾nized. Determination of plasma ammonia levels should be
included in a laboratory work-up in case of acute psychi￾atric and neurological symptoms or unexplained coma in
the intensive care unit.
