Abstract
Background
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Also referred to as coronary artery
disease (CAD) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD), it manifests clinically as myocardial
infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy. This study aims to evaluate the epidemiological trends of IHD
globally.
Methods
The most up-to-date epidemiological data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset were analyzed.
GBD collates data from a large number of sources, including research studies, hospital registries, and
government reports. This dataset includes annual figures from 1990 to 2017 for IHD in all countries and
regions. We analyzed the incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for IHD.
Forecasting for the next two decades was conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) Time Series Modeler (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
Results
Our study estimated that globally, IHD affects around 126 million individuals (1,655 per 100,000), which is
approximately 1.72% of the world’s population. Nine million deaths were caused by IHD globally. Men were
more commonly affected than women, and incidence typically started in the fourth decade and increased
with age. The global prevalence of IHD is rising. We estimated that the current prevalence rate of 1,655 per
100,000 population is expected to exceed 1,845 by the year 2030. Eastern European countries are sustaining
the highest prevalence. Age-standardized rates, which remove the effect of population changes over time,
have decreased in many regions.
Conclusions
IHD is the number one cause of death, disability, and human suffering globally. Age-adjusted rates show a
promising decrease. However, health systems have to manage an increasing number of cases due to
population aging.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases cause approximately one-third of deaths worldwide [1]. Among cardiovascular
illnesses, ischemic heart disease (IHD) ranks as the most prevalent [2]. Indeed, IHD is acknowledged as an
important threat to sustainable development in the 21st century [3]. Also referred to as coronary artery
disease (CAD) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD), IHD manifests clinically as myocardial
infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy. An increasing number of individuals with non-fatal IHD live with
chronic disabilities and impaired quality of life [4]. The primary pathological process that leads to IHD is
atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease of the arteries associated with lipid deposition and metabolic
alterations due to multiple risk factors. More than 70% of at-risk individuals have multiple risk factors for
IHD, and only 2%-7% of the general population have no risk factors [5].
The increasing incidence of IHD is expected to continue, due not only to the increased prevalence of obesity,
diabetes, and metabolic syndrome but also to population aging [6]. The past two decades have witnessed a

Study. Cureus 12(7): e9349. DOI 10.7759/cureus.9349

steep rise in global population aging [7]. Indeed, the United Nations estimates an increase in the population
aged over 65 years from one in 11 in 2019 to one in six by 2050 [8]. Emerging issues with social relationships,
psychological distress, and less than six hours of sleep a night also contribute to IHD in the current
generation [9-10]. Rapid urbanization and globalization in the lower and middle-income countries (LMIC)
have led to a shift in disease-related deaths and disabilities from infectious disease to non-communicable
diseases such as IHD [4-5].
The financial impact of IHD stems from hospitalizations, treatments, revascularization procedures, clinic
visits, emergency visits, and prescribed drug treatments [11]. According to the World Heart Federation, the
global cost of CVD in 2010 was approximately US$863 billion, which is expected to rise to more than US$1
trillion by 2030. In countries like the United States, the cost of IHD is approaching 1%-1.5% of the gross
domestic product (GDP), with costs per episode of IHD of more than $5,000 (7,13). Notably, the median total
cost of IHD care in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) country-specific health expenditure per capita
was 10% of the total healthcare expenditure [12].
Despite the high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of IHD, relatively few studies have quantified current
epidemiological trends and global forecasts for IHD. For health policy-makers to develop effective and
timely strategies to address IHD, an up-to-date analysis is needed. This study aims to analyze the global
epidemiology of IHD based on the most recent data and to estimate its future trends.
Materials And Methods
Current epidemiological data on IHD from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset were analyzed in this
study [13]. The GBD dataset has several attractive features: it is actively maintained and updated based on
research data and published epidemiological studies and governmental publications from more than 90,000
sources. According to empirical data, it builds models and statistical estimates for health loss due to illness,
injury, and risk factors. Annually, the GBD produces prevalence, incidence, death, and disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs) measures, which are used to estimate the overall burden of IHD. DALYs are calculated by
adding YLLs (years of life lost due to premature death) and YLDs (years of life lost due to disability). It is
considered a more rigorous measure of the human impact of disease than simple prevalence or mortality
rates.
For this study, the latest data from GBD, the 2017 update, was used. This includes annual figures from 1990
to 2017 for IHD in almost all countries and regions. No regions or countries were excluded. Based on
geographical divisions, GBD divides the world into four regions: Asia, Europe, America, and Africa. We
analyzed data for all countries in these four regions of the GBD dataset. Age-adjusted rates were used to
compare annual rates from 1990 to 2017, to compensate for the effects of changes in population structure
and aging. The Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) guidelines
were used to guide transparent data analysis and reporting (Table 1) [14]. We analyzed selected countries
within the GBD's four world regions based upon the prevalence rates and geographical size.

distributions
All figures are rates per 100,000 population for 2017. Global Burden of Disease (GBD) four world regions with selected countries based on the
prevalence rates and geographical size.
In 2017, around nine million deaths were attributed to IHD, making it the leading cause of mortality
worldwide. IHD has retained this leading position for more than two decades.
In terms of regional distribution, IHD shows the highest prevalence in central and Eastern Europe (Figure 1),

During the last two decades, several Eastern European countries, such as Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia,
and the Czech Republic, have moved up the ranks of highest prevalence. In contrast, high-income countries,
such as the United Kingdom, Finland, Denmark, Germany, and Italy, moved down the ranks. Western Europe
continues to show an increasing prevalence, substantially higher than South Asia (the Indian subcontinent)
and the rest of the world (Figure 2).

Forecasts of prevalence based on predictive models indicate that by 2030, the prevalence of IHD could
increase to more than 1,845 per 1000,000, with an upper confidence estimate of 1,917 per 100,000.
Male gender is a well-known risk factor and, consequently, the prevalence of IHD was higher in men as
compared to women (1,786 vs. 1,522 cases per 100,000). This difference is present in all age groups. The age
of onset also appears to be earlier in men. The age distribution showed expected patterns of the rising
prevalence and incidence with increasing age (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3: Age distribution of ischemic heart disease worldwide based
on prevalence (A) and incidence (B), 2017
Incidence increases from the fourth decade of life and does not decrease after that, reflecting the role of age
as a risk factor. Prevalence remains higher than the incidence for all age groups, indicating the chronic
nature of IHD.
In terms of human suffering, DALY is a more accurate measure to quantify the burden of disease than
prevalence and mortality. In terms of DALY, IHD is the leading cause of disability and years of life lost
globally, moving from the fourth position in 1990 to the first position in 2017.
Discussion
IHD is the leading cause of premature mortality and suffering worldwide, retaining this leading position for
decades, albeit with considerable variation across regions. While IHD continues to rise in terms of absolute
numbers, age-adjusted rates do show evidence of a decrease.
The number of patients diagnosed with IHD increased over the past 27 years. This increase in CVD burden
has serious implications for health systems’ capacity and planning. Particularly, a policy focused on
providing tertiary cardiac care may be unsustainable without a corresponding emphasis on prevention and
primary care [15]. As this rise is partly due to population increase and aging (the incidence and prevalence of
IHD increase with age), age-standardized rates are more indicative of the underlying trends [16]. According
2020 Khan et al. Cureus 12(7): e9349. DOI 10.7759/cureus.9349 7 of 9

to an earlier analysis of GBD data from 1990 to 2010, DALYs increased by 32.4% globally because of
population aging and increased by 22.1% because of the increased population [4].
A key finding of our study is that age-standardized rates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of
suffering (as indicated by DALYs) have declined over the past two decades in many regions. This may be due
to increasing awareness of lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking, obesity, and exercise [17]. Public
health initiatives have also helped to reduce smoking [18]. National strategies for health promotion can help
curtail the obesity epidemic [19]. Although the age-adjusted rates trend down, IHD is by far the leading cause
of death [20]. Countries in Eastern Europe show a disproportionately high burden of IHD [17]. This high
burden is difficult to attribute to any single factor, however, lifestyle, social stress, and alcoholism have
been implicated [17,21-22]. In certain countries, the increased current burden could be attributed to
changing population distributions [21,23].
Recent studies relating to the CVD burden have indicated a potential association of increased CVD burden
with lower socioeconomic status and less education [24]. Hence, the burden of IHD may be addressed by
effective investment in educating the public and creating an awareness of CVD-associated risk factors and
early symptoms. Some researchers have suggested that it may be useful to reduce socioeconomic disparity to
reduce disease burden [25]. Both age-standardized incidence and mortality have decreased globally in the
past 27 years, with high-income countries experiencing the most significant decline. However, the total
number of cases will continue to rise due to worsening metabolic risk factors [16]. The forecast of an
increased disability burden due to IHD should prompt healthcare policymakers to promote strategies such as
putting more emphasis on primary care and primary prevention of IHD. There is a growing concern that the
CVD burden is bound to rise due in LMIC to risk factors such as smoking and an unhealthy diet [26-27].
Major challenges of IHD on the health system could be addressed by effective measures to reduce tobacco
smoking [28]. Consistent advice on a healthy diet during childhood could also reduce the development of
metabolic syndrome in early adulthood [29]. Public health measures, such as reducing total salt intake by
one third, could reduce deaths due to IHD by 8% [30].
The main limitation of our study is the reliance on secondary data. The GBD dataset relies on modeling and
estimation based on primary data. Real-world data sources can be inaccurate, patchy, and subject to change
due to changes in disease classification. Thus, the inferences derived should be considered carefully in light
of evolving research evidence. Additionally, GBD does not subdivide IHD into its constituent elements such
as myocardial infarction, angina, or heart failure due to ischaemic cardiomyopathy. While it was not possible
to analyze acute versus chronic ischemic presentations, the overall burden of illness due to IHD can still be
ascertained reasonably accurately. Despite these limitations, this study provides new insights based on the
most up-to-date data available, which have not been published elsewhere.
Conclusions
IHD remains the leading cause of death and premature mortality worldwide, with economic development
and urbanization having the greatest impact on disease development. The present analysis provides
evidence of a promising decline in age-adjusted rates in many regions. The causes of IHD are well￾established, including risk factors such as calorie-dense processed foods, stress, a sedentary lifestyle, and
cigarette smoking, so aggressive preventive measures are warranted to control this scourge of modern life.
