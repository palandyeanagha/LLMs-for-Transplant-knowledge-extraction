Abstract
In this study of eight rare atypical deletion cases with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WS; also known as 7q11.23 deletion
syndrome) consisting of three different patterns of deletions, compared to typical WS and typically developing (TD)
individuals, we show preliminary evidence of dissociable genetic contributions to brain structure and human cognition.
Univariate and multivariate pattern classification results of morphometric brain patterns complemented by behavior
implicate a possible role for the chromosomal region that includes: 1) GTF2I/GTF2IRD1 in visuo-spatial/motor integration,
intraparietal as well as overall gray matter structures, 2) the region spanning ABHD11 through RFC2 including LIMK1, in
social cognition, in particular approachability, as well as orbitofrontal, amygdala and fusiform anatomy, and 3) the regions
including STX1A, and/or CYLN2 in overall white matter structure. This knowledge contributes to our understanding of the
role of genetics on human brain structure, cognition and pathophysiology of altered cognition in WS. The current study
builds on ongoing research designed to characterize the impact of multiple genes, gene-gene interactions and changes in
gene expression on the human brain.

Introduction
Imaging genetics research provides an unprecedented opportu￾nity for studying interactions among genes, brain and behavior in
humans. For example, studies have explored associations of
common genetic polymorphisms, including those related to
catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), monoamine oxidase A
(MAOA) and serotonin transporter length polymorphism (5-
HTTLPR/SLC6A4), with brain structure and function [1].
Similarly, examination of rare, atypical duplications and deletions
associated with disorders such as Williams-Beuren syndrome (WS)
can further illuminate our understanding of gene-brain-behavior
relationships [2].
WS is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a hemizygous
deletion of approximately 28 genes on 7q11.23 [3]. WS is
associated with poor visuo-spatial construction and increased
social drive [4]. The existence of this well delineated profile and
known genetic architecture of WS offers unique opportunities to
investigate the neurogenetic basis of cognition in humans [5].
Using this approach comparing WS to typically developing (TD)
controls, studies have found the genes deleted in WS to be
important for intraparietal sulcus (IPS) morphology, which in turn
mediates visuo-spatial construction [6], and amygdala-orbitofron￾tal (OFC)-fusiform circuitry as related to socio-emotional abilities
[7–9]. These studies suggest genetically controlled neural circuit￾ries for regulating human behavior, and show how brain imaging
data may serve as ideal intermediate endophenotypes mediating
gene and behavior.
To further gain a better understanding of the neurogenetic basis
of human behavior using this ‘model disease’ approach, the
current study undertook a targeted investigation of persons with
WS having rare atypical deletions (AWSdel) by comparing these
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104088

individuals to WS and TD groups. While most individuals with
WS exhibit the full ‘classic deletion,’ there are rare cases (,2%)
where relatively smaller deletions occur [10]. It is currently
unknown how smaller WS deletions impact brain structure in WS.
By investigating AWSdel, new insights into the role of specific
genes on brain and behavior can be obtained. To accomplish this
goal, we collected brain imaging data and behavioral data from
samples of AWSdel, WS and TD. There were three types of
deletions among the AWSdel cases; i.e., one where the genes
GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 were spared, another where the region
from TRIM50/FKBP6 to (but not including) STX1A was spared,
and a third where small deletions occurred between ABHD11
through RFC2 including LIMK1 (Figure 1). We focused on
visuo-spatial and social cognition, two key phenotypes of WS and
examined whether each AWSdel case resembled WS or TD. The
overarching objective of this investigation was to deduce gene￾brain-behavior associations by examining genes that are com￾monly deleted in those with similar neuroanatomical and
behavioral profiles among individuals comprising our AWSdel
sample (Figure 1).
Material and Methods
Ethics Statement
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of Stanford University and Salk Institute. All participants
provided written informed consent or assent. Parents or guardians
provided written consent in addition to written assent if the
participants were minors.
Subjects
Participants included a total of 72 with WS, 54 with TD, and 8
individuals with AWSdel (Table 1, 2). The 8 individuals with
AWSdel had previously received a clinical diagnosis of WS. In
each case, one or more genes commonly deleted in WS were
spared (AWSdel-01 [ID#: 5623; spared for GTF2I and
GTF2IRD1], AWSdel-02 [ID#: 5657; spared from FKBP6/
FZD9 up to WBSCR22, deletion includes STX1A], AWSdel-03
family i-vi [ID#s: 5882, 5884-5888; small deletions from
ABHD11 through RFC2 including LIMK1) on chromosome
7q11.23 (Figure 1).
Exclusion criteria included a history of significant medical and
neurological conditions or symptoms not known to be associated
with WS such as cerebral palsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson’s disease or head trauma resulting in loss of conscious￾ness. Epilepsy occurs in WS but does not have as high a rate as in
other neurodevelopment conditions such as autism, fragile X and
tuberous sclerosis. Thus, these were exclusions for WS (typical
AND atypical) as well as for controls. All WS and AWSdel
participants received cognitive-behavioral, genetic and imaging
assessments as part of a multi-site program project grant on
genetics, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and cognition.
Healthy control participants (with no history of major psychi￾atric, neurological, or cognitive impairment) were recruited at
both the Salk Institute and Stanford University. TD control
participants were further screened to rule out any history of
learning, language, or behavioral disorder over the phone using a
screening form as in our prior studies of WS and other
neurogenetic conditions (e.g. [25]).
Genetic Testing
In order to confirm the extent of each participant’s deletion
(typical WS and AWSdel), a series of genetic analyses were
performed. Specifically, deletions in all the typical WS were
confirmed by the use of Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)
with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) including in all cases,
probes for ELN and in addition, subsets of probes marking the
ends of the typically deleted region (1008H17 for FKBP6, FZD9;
592D8 for ELN, LIMK1; and 1184P14 for GTF2I), for the
typically non-deleted single copy gene, CALN1 (815K3) located
upstream of the centromeric duplicated region. Probes for the
duplicated regions flanking the common deletion were employed
along with ELN as a screen for the common deletion [16]. For
atypical participants AWSdel-01 and AWSdel-02, further FISH
analyses used a total of twenty-one sequenced linked DNAs
isolated from either BACs [16] or cosmids [17] to cover the region
defining the deletion breakpoints as described in [18]. Quantita￾tive PCR was performed using probes spanning from CALN1 to
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of deleted genes in WS and in partial deletion participants (AWSdel). Genes listed in the figure are either
ones known to be expressed in the brain and are important for neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and neuronal reorganization: LIMK1 [54], FZD9
[55], STX1A [56], CYLN2 [57], GTF2 I[58] and GTF2IRD1 [59], or are break-points.

WBSCR16 and template DNA isolated from blood and/or
lymphoblast cell lines, to determine the deleted region of atypical
participants AWSdel-01, AWSdel-02, AWSdel-03i-vi [18]. Finally,
a custom high resolution genomic NimbleGen array [15] spanning
a 13 Mb region that included the typical deletion, flanking repeats
and surrounding single copy DNA, was used to define the deletion
structures in atypical participants AWSdel-01, AWSdel-02,
AWSdel-03-i, iv, v [15,19]. A schematic diagram showing atypical
deletions of these 8 cases is presented in Figure 1.
Cognitive/Behavioral Testing
Participants were given a standard battery of measures that
included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) [20] and
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) [21] to measure
verbal, performance and full-scale IQ. IQ was available for all but
5 WS and 2 TD. There were no significant differences between the
participants with and without IQ in level of cognitive function on
any measure listed in Table 1 (all p’s .0.1).
Participants also completed a series of tasks designed to assess
visuo-spatial functioning. This included the Block Design subtest
of the IQ tests (a timed test where the participant arranges the
blocks with white and/or red sides according to a pattern), Beery
Visuo-Motor Integration [22] (the participant reproduces simple
line drawings) and non-normed Benton Judgment of Line
Orientation test [23] (the participant identifies the slope of the
presented lines on the display of 11 lines).
Lastly we used a non-normed test to measure social approach￾ability in each participant [24]. This task involves participants
reporting how likely they would approach a person depicted in a
photograph.
WS individuals showed significantly reduced IQ and visuo￾spatial abilities, and significantly higher social approachability
scores (all p’s,0.05). Please see Table 2 for mean scores,
statistics, and scores of partial deletion cases. Analyses of cognitive
profiles were performed in parallel to the anatomical brain
measures described below with a cut-off score of z = 1.65 (1-tailed)
instead of z = 1.96 that was used for brain measures.
Acquisition of Anatomical Brain Measures
MRI data were collected on two scanners (1.5 T and 3.0 T,
respectively). Data from 2 of the AWSdel (AWSdel-01, AWS￾del02), 42 WS and 40 TD individuals were obtained using a 1.5T
MRI scanner. Data from AWSdel-03i , AWSdel03vi (father and
5 adolescent children), 30 WS and 14 TD individuals were
obtained at a subsequent time using a 3.0T MRI scanner. The
Main Text reports findings comparing AWSdel (including
AWSdel-03 data obtained from a 3.0T) to WS and TD data
from 1.5T. The results were unchanged when 3.0T reference data
from individuals with WS and TD MRI served as the reference to
which MRI data from individuals with AWS (acquired from both
1.5T and 3.0T scanners) were compared (see Supporting
Results).
All 1.5T data (42 WS, 40 TD, AWSdel-01, AWSdel-02) were
acquired with a GE-Signa 1.5T scanner (General Electric,
Milwaukee, WI) located at one of three sites: University of
California, San Diego Medical Center Magnetic Resonance
Imaging Institute (N = 59), Scripps Clinic, San Diego (N = 53),
or Stanford University (N = 5). Across all locations and in all cases,
sagittal brain images were acquired with the same three￾dimensional (3D) volumetric radio frequency spoiled gradient
echo (spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in a steady state) pulse
sequence using the following scan parameters: repetition time, 24
msec; echo time, 5 msec; flip angle, 45u; number of excitations, 2;
matrix size, 256 6 192; field of view, 24 cm; slice thickness,
1.2 mm; 124 contiguous slices.
The remaining participants (30 WS, 14 TD, AWSdel-03i,vi)
underwent MRI on a GE-Signa 3.0 T scanner (General Electric,
Milwaukee, WI) at Stanford University. In these cases, coronal
brain images were acquired with a three-dimensional enhanced
fast gradient echo (EFGRE3D) pulse sequence using the following
scan parameters: repetition time, 6 msec; echo time, 1.5 msec; flip
angle, 15u; number of excitations, 3; matrix size, 256 6256; field
of view, 24 cm; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; 124 contiguous slices.
Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) Processing
VBM analyses of 42 WS and 40 TD MR images from the 1.5T
scanners were performed using SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.
uk/spm) and VBM5.1 (http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm). After
bias correction, T1 images were segmented into gray matter, white
matter and cerebral spinal fluid. Hidden Markov Random Field
(prior probability weight 0.3) was used to encode spatial
information through spatial constraints of neighboring voxels.
Normalization was performed using both adult and custom
templates created from the 42 individuals with WS and 40 with
TD. Both Jacobian modulated (non-linear warping only; reflecting
regional gray matter volume) and nonmodulated (reflecting gray
matter density) images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian
kernel with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm.
Analyses of gray matter density were performed to compare with
our previous report on WS individuals [25]. Segmentation and
normalization for each participant was confirmed by manual
inspection of the images. These steps were repeated for the 30 WS
and 14 TD MR images collected using 3.0T.
Regions of Interest (ROIs)
ROIs were restricted to brain regions that showed significant
differences between WS and TD individuals in gray matter images
processed using VBM (Figure S1, Table S1). Results comparing
WS and TD are reported in Supporting Results and not in the
Main Text because the results (from 1.5T) have been reported
previously (e.g. [25]) and results from 3.0T are used to replicate
our findings. Our particular interest was in the intraparietal sulcus
(IPS; right more than left), thought to be critical for visuo-spatial
processing, and the amgydala, orbitofrontal cortex and fusiform
gyri (right more than left) thought to be critical for social cognition
and face processing. While the amygdala did not reach
significance comparing WS and TD with VBM, based on
evidence that the amygdala is structurally and functionally
abnormal in WS and its importance in socio-emotional function￾ing [25,26], this region was manually delineated as described
below.
Volumetric Measures of the Amygdala
Amygdala volumes were obtained from delineation based on
anatomical landmarks by trained research staff who followed a
detailed protocol [25]. Briefly, the amygdala delineation was
initiated on the coronal slice where the anterior commissure was
best distinguished and proceeded in the posterior direction until
both the amygdala and hippocampus were clearly visible on the
same slice. Superior, inferior and lateral boundaries were each
designated by prominent white matter tracks, while the medial
boundary was designated by either white matter or cerebral spinal
fluid. Inter-rater reliabilities for all volumes described in this study
were $ 0.90 as determined by the intraclass correlation coefficient.

Univariate Analyses
Brain images of each AWSdel case processed using VBM were
compared to the WS and TD datasets (see Supporting
Methods). We generated two voxel-wise z-score maps per
AWSdel case that indicated how each AWSdel’s brain image
deviated from WS and TD groups (thresholded at z.1.96 and
z,21.96, p’s,0.05). For example, if a partial deletion case
showed |z|.1.96 from one group and |z|,1.96 from the other,
then it was determined that the partial deletion case resembled the
latter group. In the case of the AWSdel-03 family (father and 5
children with same atypical WS deletion), after creating these
thresholded z-score maps for each family member AWSdel￾03i,vi, we further created probabilistic maps using the thre￾sholded images to examine the proportion of family members that
showed z.1.96 or z,21.96. These z-score and probabilistic
images allowed us to visualize whether each AWSdel case showed
a relative propensity for WS-like versus TD-like neuroanatomical
patterns.
Results comparing WS and TD groups utilizing standard SPM5
and custom templates (Figure S1, Table S1), gray matter
volume and density (Figure S1), and 1.5T and 3.0T scanners
(Figure S2) are also reported in Supporting Results. AWSdel
results comparing standard gray matter volume and density
(Figure S3) and 1.5T and 3.0T scanners (Figure S4), are also
reported in Supporting Results. There were no observable
differences in results obtained from different templates, measures
(volume vs. density) and magnet strength that appeared to
influence the current findings. Further, though age and gender
were corrected for all imaging analyses, the results did not change;
hence we report findings without these covariates.
Multivariate Pattern Classification Analyses (MVPA)
Cross-validated linear support vector machine (SVM) was
utilized as the primary method of performing MVPA to
accomplish two objectives. First, these analyses were conducted
as a complementary approach to univariate analyses described
above for investigating whether voxels in brain regions related to
visuo-spatial functioning and social cognition would classify each
AWSdel individual as belonging to either the WS or TD group.
Second, MVPA was used to investigate whether each AWSdel
individual would be classified as WS or TD when the entire
population of either gray matter or white matter voxels were
considered.
Voxels included in the MVPA were segmented using one of two
approaches: 1) bilateral superior parietal lobules (SPL), orbito￾frontal cortices (OFC), amygdalae and fusiform gyri were defined
using the WFU PickAtlas (http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/cms/
software#PickAtlas) and Automated Talairach Atlas Label
(AAL) (http://www.cyceron.fr/freeware/), then coregistered to
the modulated VBM gray matter images, and 2) masks comprising
all brain gray or white matter voxels were obtained from the
SPM5 generated segmentation. Non-smoothed images were
down-sampled to 4mm voxels and voxel-by-subject matrices were
created for each (set) of these brain regions. Linear support vector
machine (SVM) analyses were performed (regularization param￾eter C = 1), with leave-one-out cross-validation using an in-house
toolbox used in previous studies [27–33]. Feature reduction was
performed using leave-one-out recursive feature elimination
(RFE), recursively eliminating 30% of the voxels to identify the
optimal performance [34,35]. A classifier from each of the leave￾one-out cross-validation steps was applied to each AWSdel
individual, allowing us to calculate the probability of each AWSdel
individual being classified as an individual with WS or TD. As
reference, visuo-spatial regions classified WS from TD at 100%
accuracy, social regions at 95.1% accuracy, gray matter at 97.6%
accuracy and white matter at 98.8% accuracy. These references
indicate that MVPA is capable of classifying WS and TD controls
and serves as a basis for performing further MVPA on AWSdel
cases.
Results
Neuroanatomical and Behavioral Abnormalities
Associated with Visuo-Spatial Function in Atypical WS
Deletion Cases (AWSdel)
Results from the IPS, a region that plays a central role in visuo￾spatial processing [36] and in which a specific cluster was defined
from the between-group WS vs. TD comparison (see Supporting
Results, Figure S1, and Figure S2), are shown in Figure 2A
and Table 3 (see also Figure S3, Figure S4). AWSdel-01
showed voxels with values exceeding z.1.96 compared to WS, but
no voxels with values that were |z|.1.96 when compared to TD,
indicating that AWSdel-01 shows IPS volumes within the
distribution of TD. In AWSdel-02, voxels with values z,21.96
compared to TD were found in the IPS, but no voxels with values
that were |z|.1.96 when compared to WS, indicating that
AWSdel-02 shows IPS volumes comparable to WS. Further, in
AWSdel-03, all family members showed voxels with values within
the range of TD (|z|,1.96) and greater than WS (all members
showed z.1.96), indicating that AWSdel-03 shows IPS volumes
similar to TD. Since MRI data of the AWSdel-03 family were
collected from 3.0T rather than the 1.5T reference data from 42
WS and 40 TD participants, AWSdel-03 cases were also
compared to the 3.0T reference dataset of 30 WS and 14 TD
participants. Results from this 3.0T scanner comparison (Figure
S4) were essentially identical to the 1.5T results in Figure 2A.
We created a classifier (model) designed to optimally discrim￾inate between WS and TD using permutation-based MVPA.

MVPA was performed using voxel intensity measures from
objectively and anatomically defined left and right superior
parietal lobules (SPL) within VBM processed images. Consistent
with VBM results, using permutation-based analyses, AWSdel-01
and all AWSdel-03 family members were categorized as TD with
100% probability, and AWSdel-02 was categorized as WS with
100% probability.
Behavioral performance on visuo-spatial functions (Beery
Visuo-Motor Integration, Benton Judgment of Line Orientation
and Wechsler Block Design tasks) for each AWSdel case compared
to that of WS and TD individuals generally paralleled the
neuroanatomical results (Table 1, 2, Figure 2B). The results of
this analysis showed that AWSdel-01 was within or closer to (for
visuo-motor integration and block design) the range of TD,
AWSdel-02 was within the range of WS (clearly for visuo-motor
integration and judgment of line orientation, though not for block
design), and AWSdel-03 was within the range of TD (though in
this case only for visuo-motor integration and not for judgment of
line orientation or block design). Overall, these results implicate
GTF2I and/or GTF2IRD1 as candidate genes contributing to
altered IPS volumes and visuo-spatial function, in particular visuo￾motor integration as consistent with previous animal [37] and
human behavioral research [15,38] (Figure 3).
Neuroanatomical and Behavioral Abnormalities
Associated with Social Cognitive Function in Atypical WS
Deletion Cases (AWSdel)
Next, we examined morphometric patterns related to social
cognitive function in AWSdel. All AWSdel cases showed increased
volumes in bilateral fusiform gyri and the right orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) compared to TD (z.1.96); this profile was similar to typical
WS participants (|z|,1.96) (Figure 2A, Table 3, Figure S3,
Figure S4). In the manually delineated amygdala, we found that
WS showed significantly greater gray matter volume in bilateral
amygdala compared to TD (Table 1). In the left amygdala, all
AWSdel cases showed increased volume compared to TD (z.
1.96), which was similar to WS (|z|,1.96) (Figure 2B). Using
permutation-based MVPA, we observed that a combination of
objectively defined amygdala, OFC and fusiform gyrus regions of
interest showed 100% probability (using permutation-based
analysis) that all AWSdel cases would be categorized as WS.
Subject performance on social behavior (Adolph’s social
approachability test) for each AWSdel case was compared to
average social behavior scores in WS and TD groups. The results
of this analysis showed that all AWSdel cases exhibited increased
sociability relative to TD controls, again paralleling the neuroan￾atomical findings (Table 2, Figure 2B). Each case was more
similar to the WS group relative to the TD group. There are
several genes commonly deleted in our typical WS and AWSdel
groups (genes located between ABHD11 and RFC2). However,
one gene in particular, LIMK1, is known to affect brain
development [39], thus suggesting that haploinsufficiency of
LIMK1 as one potential explanation for aberrant OFC, fusiform
and amygdala volumes, as well as abnormalities of social
approachability in WS (Figure 3).
Neuroanatomical Abnormalities of Overall Gray and
White Matter Patterns in Atypical WS Deletion Cases
(AWSdel)
In our final analyses, we applied cross-validated MVPA to
investigate gene(s) that potentially contribute to distinct patterns as
derived from voxel-by-voxel volumes comprising the entire gray
matter and white matter compartments. Using permutation-based
analyses, gray matter results showed that, similar to visuo-spatial
processing, AWSdel-01 was categorized as TD with 89.0%
probability (and hence as WS with 11% probability), AWSdel-02
as WS with 100% probability and all AWSdel-03 family members
as TD with 100% probability. White matter results indicated that
AWSdel-01 was categorized as WS with 98.9% probability,
AWSdel-02 as WS with 100% probability and AWSdel-03 family
members as TD with 100% probability. These results suggest that
gray matter structure varies with the presence or absence of
GTF2I/GTF2IRD1, while white matter structure is most related
to the status of genes in the region of STX1A and CYLN2 which
are common to AWSdel-01 and AWSdel-02 but outside the
deletion in AWSdel-03 (Figure 3). Deleted genes in WS that are
particularly important in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics
and possibly in white matter development are LIMK1, STX1A,
CYLN2 and possibly FZD9 [4,40]. Among these genes, STX1A
and CYLN2 are deleted in AWSdel-01 and AWSdel-02 and are
spared in AWSdel-03 raising the possibility that STX1A and
CYLN2 may be among the genes involved in white matter
development in WS.
Discussion
Our results provide evidence implicating particular genes in the
development of brain structures involved in visuo-spatial function
and social cognition in humans. If the contribution of single genes
is measureable and related to the characteristic pattern that we
observe in this study, the findings indicate a role for GTF2I and/
or GTF2IRD1 in IPS volumes known to be involved in visuo￾spatial function, and more generally, in patterns of gray matter
structure; the LIMK1 region (and possibly other genes located
between ABHD11 through RFC2) in the volumes of the
amygdala, OFC and fusiform gyrus, which are known to be
involved in social approachability; and CYLN2/STX1A in white
matter development.
The right IPS has been consistently shown to be involved in
visuo-spatial constructions, including visuo-motor integration [36].
Evidence suggests that visuo-motor deficits may be one of the most
characteristic features of WS [41], and the IPS results in our 8
atypical cases (with 3 different patterns of atypical deletions) point
to GTF2I and/or GTF2IRD1 as critical for the performance of
these tasks, as suggested previously [15,38]. The way by which
these genes affect the anatomy and behavior demonstrated in this
study is not known. GTF2I encodes a multifunctional phospho￾Figure 2. Gray matter volumes and cognitive profiles of typical WS, TD, and atypical deletion (AWSdel) individuals. A. Gray matter

protein with roles in transcription and signal transduction [42].
The protein encoded by GTF2IRD1 contains five GTF2I-like
repeats and functions as a transcription factor or as a positive
transcriptional regulator under the control of the Retinoblastoma
protein. Both Gtf2i and Gtf2ird1 are widely expressed in the brain
during the embryonic stages of mouse development [43]. In adult
mice, they are present exclusively in neurons, but the two proteins
play nonredundant, differentially regulated roles, despite their
similar structure. At present, the specific genes whose expression
are most affected by these regulatory genes are not known. Nor is
it known how, and to what extent, Gtf2i and Gtf2ird1 are
explicitly involved in IPS morphometric variability, although

converging evidence from our previous behavioral study [15]
suggests GTF2IRD1 to be principally responsible.
The cognitive profiles examined here, though partially consis￾tent with the anatomical findings, showed some discrepancies.
Visuo-motor integration was consistent with IPS volume findings
throughout all cases, but judgment of line orientation and block
design results were inconsistent in the AWSdel-03 family (i.e.,
judgment of line orientation and block design showed more WS￾like patterns even though IPS and visuo-motor integration showed
TD-like patterns). However, this is not altogether surprising, since
behavior is downstream to genetics and neuroanatomy, and hence
may be influenced in many different ways that are difficult to
reliably assess (as opposed to the more upstream neuroanatomical
measure) [1]. Alternatively, it may be that in WS, GTF2I/
GTF2IRD1 have greater involvement in IPS and visual construc￾tion and motor components (represented by visuo-motor integra￾tion) than visual perceptual functions (represented by judgment of
line orientation and block design). In addition, multiple WS genes
could contribute to decreased visual perceptual functions.
There is limited behavioral research on WS with partial
deletions [11–15]. The current findings replicate our previous
report showing the important role of GTF2IRD1 in visuo-spatial
abilities [15]. However, our study results contradict other
behavioral studies of visuo-spatial abilities [11–15]. Karmiloff￾Smith et al. [11] reported an atypical deletion case with a deletion
from FKBP6 to GTF2IRDI and showed this case to be associated
with relatively spared visual-spatial functioning and abnormal
social behavior. Antonell et al. [13] reported that the deletion of
GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 may contribute to the global intellectual
deficit and some aspects of the cognitive profile but not visuo￾spatial ability. Tassabehji et al. [12] and Gray et al. [14] showed
an association between LIMK1 and visual-spatial construction.
One of the most striking features of WS is gregariousness,
reduced fear for strangers, and relative preservation of a subset of
face processing skills. The amygdala is known to be an important
component of the neural systems involved in retrieving socially
relevant knowledge on the basis of facial features, in particular
approachability and trustworthiness [24], probably through its role
in regulating fear. Further, the OFC is known to regulate
amygdala reactivity through a frontal-amygdala-insular circuit
that provides feedback about somatic state activation, which aids
in social decision-making [44,45] and empathy [46,47]. Finally,
the (right) fusiform gyrus is considered to be a face processing
region that is particularly important for normal social interactions,
and provides input to the anterior limbic regions [48]. Typical WS
and all AWSdel participants in this study who have deletions of
genes from ABHD11 through RFC2 including LIMK1, showed
developmental anomalies of the amygdala, OFC and/or fusiform
cortex. LIMK1 is a particularly a strong candidate among the
deleted genes for playing a role in the anomalous neuroanatomical
pattern described above because of its known role in brain
function and dendritic spine architecture [39],
LIMK1 is thought to be a component of an intracellular
signaling pathway involved in brain development. In particular,
LIMK1 controls actin dynamics via phosphorylation of cofilin,
and has been implicated in the control of growth cone motility in
cultured neurons [49] and in white matter development [50]. It is
difficult to disentangle from our study which neurobiological
pathways or neural structures are more directly influenced by
LIMK1 and which brain regions are affected by a combination of
interactions among genes in the deleted regions. Nevertheless, it is
attractive to propose LIMK1, as one gene contributing to
abnormal social cognitive profiles in WS, either via impaired
input from higher-level visual (fusiform face) areas or through
interactions between the OFC and amygdala. It is important to
note that these effects may derive from both pre- and post-natal
effects on brain development or adult function. Future studies
examining the causal relationship of brain activation patterns
within these structures in the context of social-affective processing
will be of interest.
There are several genes that have been implicated in WS social
cognition. Although LIMK1 was an attractive target, there is only
one animal study to date that has suggested a role for LIMK1 in
social cognition (fear responses) and this finding was interpreted
within the context of impaired learning and hippocampal function
[39]. In other studies, LIMK1 has only been implicated in visuo￾spatial function [51]. In contrast, recent literature on social
cognition in WS points to a potential role for GTF2I/GTF2IRD1
[15,43,52], regions between LIMK1 and GTF2I/GTF2IRD1
[53], or regions between FKBP6 and GTF2IRD1 [11]. These
genes are further implicated by mice with heterozygous or
homozygous disruption of Gtf2ird1 who exhibit decreased fear,
aggression and anxiety and increased social behaviors as well as
increased levels of serotonin metabolites in the amygdala and
frontal cortex [43]. Future studies using multiple standardized and
non-standardized behavioral measures, in larger samples in
conjunction with heterozygous animal models, which can examine
single genes at a time, and examining both brain structure and
cognitive and social profiles, are warranted.
Finally, LIMK1, CYLN2 and possibly FZD9 have been
implicated in WM development. For example, LIMK1 and
CYLN2 are known to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, axon
guidance and neuronal migration, and FZD9 may be critical for
dendritic development and axon guidance [4,40]. Our results
suggested that genes, including STX1A and/or CYLN2, may
contribute to WM development in WS.
Mice with heterozygous and homozygous disruptions of
particular genes are potentially ideal models to study gene-brain￾behavior associations, but the behavioral tests available can be
limited depending on the behavior/cognitive function of interest.
Further, the same genes in humans may not have the same
regulatory pathways and expression patterns as that occurring in
the brains of non-humans [11]. Some animal studies showing
statistical differences between wild-type and homozygous knockout
mice fail to demonstrate comparable differences when using
heterozygous mice, the genetic state most applicable to WS.
Further, the scarcity of AWSdel cases have resulted in only one or
two cases described in each report [11–15]. These factors have
made it difficult to attribute specific cognitive functions to
particular sets of genes. Our study attempted to overcome some
of these limitations by examining eight individuals with three types
of varying atypical deletions, while also assessing brain structure
for the first time in AWSdel cases.
A major limitation is that our current level of analysis only
allows attribution of subsets of genes to neuroanatomical and
cognitive findings. It is likely that there is more than one
contributory gene, gene-gene interactions within and outside the
WS deletion, as well as environmental influences and stochastic
processes that could contribute to neuroanatomical variations.
Another limitation is that, similar to typical controls, individuals
with WS demonstrate inter-individual differences in neuropsycho￾logical and behavioral function and hence future studies employ￾ing more sensitive experimental behavioral measures are warrant￾ed. Further, while this is the first study to utilize AWSdel to
examine gene-brain-behavior relationships, the small sample-size
(8 cases with 3 patterns of deletions) will necessitate replication in
future studies. Finally, in contrast to neuroanatomical volumes that
are more readily quantified, pinpointing a relationship of these to
Atypical Deletions in Williams Syndrome

behavior or cognition is limited by the extent to which a given
paradigm mirrors the function of the structure. Therefore, as a first
step, we have focused on demonstrating that individuals with
AWSdel exhibit structural brain patterns or cognitive profiles that
are either consistent or inconsistent with typical WS or TD. Future
studies will be useful in refining structure-function relationships in,
as well as interactions/connectivity amongst these regions; such
studies can help to narrow gene candidates that alter the
development or function of specific functional human brain
circuits.
In summary, we show that the current preliminary study in
individuals with rare, atypical deletions associated with WS
provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of cognitive
function and putative genetic underpinnings. These studies of
intermediate endophenotypes should prompt future research into
the relevance of variation in these genes, gene-gene interactions,
and developmental and individual differences in gene expression,
for regional brain development and normal visuo-spatial function
and social behavior.
