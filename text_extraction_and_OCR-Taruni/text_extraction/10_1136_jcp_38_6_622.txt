Morphological range of hyperplastic polyps and
carcinomas arising in hyperplastic polyps of the
stomach

SUMMARY A morphological range of 67 hyperplastic polyps was studied. They included polyps
removed endoscopically and polyps found incidentally in resected stomachs with gastric ulcers
and cancer. The hyperplastic polyps were essentially composed of cystic foveolae and pyloric type
glands, lined by cells identical to those of the normal gastric mucosa. Thirty one polyps contained
other cytological elements. In 18, intestinal metaplasia was seen; the tubules were mostly com￾posed of columnar and goblet cells and lacked Paneth cells. In 11 polyps, nine cases of gastric
dysplasia and two cases of intestinal dysplasia, dysplastic changes were found. The former con￾sisted of a proliferation of irregularly shaped pits with pleomorphic cuboidal/columnar cells with
relatively basophilic cytoplasm. They contained mucigen granules of a gastric type. The latter
consisted of atypical pits composed of closely packed, tall column.ar and small goblet cells, both
resembling adenomatous cells of the colon. In three polyps carcinomas were seen, one of which
was an intestinal type adenocarcinoma. In the other two, the cancer cells closely resembled the
normal foveolar cells, containing gastric type mucigen granules. They were gastric type adenocar￾cinomas.
The malignant potential of epithelial polyps of the
stomach continues to be a subject of considerable
discussion.' According to the recent classification,
two main types of polyp are distinguished:
adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps.' 8
Adenomatous polyps are usually antral and are
mostly sessile.'2 They are composed of atypical,
intestinal type cells not normally present in the
stomach. The terms intestinal dysplasia9 or border￾line lesion' "1 are used synonymously. In these
polyps striking epithelial atypias and even changes
indistinguishable from malignancy are occasionally
seen. Not infrequently they coexist with gastric can￾cers. "'I3 Adenomatous polyps have been thus con￾sidered to be premalignant.
Hyperplastic polyps are more common.' I They
consist of branching, cystically dilated glandular
tubules lined by cells identical to those of the normal
gastric mucosa. Cellular and nuclear atypias are not
usually seen in these polyps,'4 which suggests that
they may be harmless. Gastric carcinomas are some￾times found in stomachs with hyperplastic polyps,45
Accepted for publication 22 January 1985
however, and carcinomas occasionally arise in
polyps other than adenomas.45 Hyperplastic polyps
must therefore have some malignant potential. The
aim of the present study was to define a morphologi￾cal range of hyperplastic polyps and show how they
may be related to the development of gastric car￾cinoma.
Material and methods
This study was based on polyps removed endoscopi￾cally and polyps found incidentally in resected
stomachs with gastric cancer and ulcers. From a total
of 58 endoscopically removed polyps and 189 resec￾ted stomachs documented between 1978 and 1984,
we selected 67 acceptable as hyperplastic polyps.
Other polypoid lesions, which included villous
adenomas, adenomatous polyps of Ila subtype,"
inflammatory fibroid polyps, and non-epithelial
tumours were not studied.
In 67 polyps studied there were some mixed forms
of hyperplastic polyp, adenomatous polyp, or car￾cinoma. These polypoid lesions were studied when
part of the hyperplastic polyp was large enough to

Most specimens were fixed in 10% formalin for
24-48 h and embedded in paraffin; they were seri￾ally cut. In addition to routine haematoxylin and
eosin and periodic acid Schiff staining (oxidised by
44 mM periodic acid at 37°C and by 0 1 mM
periodic acid at 0°C), we applied mucin staining with
alcian blue at pH 1-0 and 2-5'4 and with high iron
diamine.'5 16 With these mucin stainings we differen￾tiated gastric type mucin frpm intestinal type mucin.
Some material was fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde for
20 min and then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide
for 2 h. This material was embedded in epon 812.
The cases for electron microscopical study were
selected by examining the biopsy specimens, which
were taken before polypectomy or operation. We
had to study some special cases, however, with the
material fixed in 10% formalin. This was postfixed
in 1% osmium tetroxide for 4 h and embedded in
epon 812. Ultrathin sections were then studied with
a HITACHI H-600 electron microscope.
Results
A series of hyperplastic polyps was obtained from
patients of both sexes, ranging in age from 26 to 68
years. The largest polyp was about 2-2 cm in diam￾eter, and the smallest one measured 0-4 cm. Diam￾eters of most polyps ranged between 0.6 and 1-6
cm. The histological findings are given below; there
was no correlation between histological characteris￾tics and age and sex of patients.
NORMAL HYPERPLASTIC POLYP AND
REGENERATIVE ATYPIA
Sixty seven polyps were examined: 36 were typical
hyperplastic polyps. They were characterised by an
irregular broadened contour of pits (Fig. 1). The
elongated pits communicated with glands composed
of mucinous cells of a pyloric type. Between the
foveolae and glands there was an immature cell
population with scant, basophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic
cells were confined to this region. The epithelial cells
lining the upper foveolae were strikingly cylindrical.
The nuclei were situated in the basal cytoplasm, and
the apical cytoplasm was filled with neutral mucin,
which stained with periodic acid Schiff, but not with
alcian blue or high iron diamine.'6 Ultrastructurally,
the foveolar cells of the polyps were identical to
their counterparts.'7 They contained variously sized,
stippled mucigen granules of relatively low electron
density.
Some polyps contained atypical cells near areas of
the surface erosion (Fig. 2). This change was refer￾red to as regenerative atypia. The atypical cells with
basophilic cytoplasm and irregularly shaped nuclei

were confined to the region between the pits and
glands.
INTESTINAL METAPLASIA AND EOSINOPHILIC
VARIANT
Eighteen polyps (ages of patients 43 to 68 years)
contained intestinal cells. Columnar and goblet cells
were commonly found (Fig. 3), though a brush bor￾der was poorly developed. Intestinal metaplasia was
mostly of an incomplete type.'8 Complete meta￾plasia with Paneth cells was found in only 5% (3/67)
of the polyps.
Spatially, the intestinal cells were found only
sporadically inside the polyps. By contrast, antral
mucosa outside the polyps studied showed striking
metaplasia and was usually of a complete type.'8 The
incidence of metaplasia in the antral mucosa was
about 60% in patients over 40.
Five polyps (ages of patients 45 to 62 years) con￾tained peculiar ducts, composed of eosinophilic col￾umnar cells (Fig. 4). The cell boundaries were not
clear. The cells occasionally had large oval nuclei,
which contained one or two distinct nucleoli. This
lesion seemed to be identical to those described by
Muto and Oota'9 as eosinophilic ducts (Fig. 4).
DYSPLASIAS
Gastric dysplasia
In nine polyps (patients ages 38 to 53 years) an
atypical proliferation of the pits composed of gastric
type cells was seen. The pits were irregularly shaped
and the cells had relatively basophilic cytoplasm
(Figs. 5 and 6). Their nuclei were pleomorphic.
These pits sometimes communicated with pyloric
type glands, but they were often elongated deep in
the polyp. Cellularity was occasionally high, result￾ing in an intraluminal papillary growth of the pits,
and piling up of the nuclei was often seen. Mitoses
were widely distributed in the cells of the pits. There
was a range of cytological abnormalities from mild
to severe dysplasia (Figs. 5 and 6). Some focal
lesions were so highly cellular and pleomorphic that
they might be considered malignant. The dysplastic
cells of this category resembled the normal foveolar
cells; they had well developed endoplasmic
reticulum and abundant ribosomes. They contained
coarsely stippled mucigen granules of a surface
mucous cell type. Their mucin was neutral, stained
with periodic acid Schiff, but did not stain with
alcian blue and high iron diamine.
Intestinal dysplasia
In two polyps (from a 53 year old man and a 62 year
old woman) intestinal dysplasia was found (Fig. 7).
The epithelium consisted of densely packed glandu￾lar tubules, composed of darkly stained columnar
cells with elongated nuclei and small goblet cells.
Mitotic cells were often seen. The lesion resembled
the adenomatous polyp of the colon. Dysplastic cells
were mostly found at the upper parts of the polyps.

surface was interdigitated. Most of the cancer cells
contained stippled mucigen granules of low electron
density (Fig. 11). The cancer was thus considered to
be of a gastric foveolar cell type.

Intestinal type adenocarcinoma
In one polyp (from a 55 year old man) we found an
intestinal type adenocarcinoma. The cancer tissue
consisted of tubular structures, resembling those
adenocarcinomas commonly seen in the stomachs of
older patients. The cancer cells were columnar cells,
containing large nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm.
A few mucin containing cells, similar to goblet cells,
were also found. The cancer cells had surface coat
mucin, composed of sulphomucin, which stained
with alcian blue and high iron diamine. The mucin in
goblet cells was also sulphomucin.
Discussion
Hyperplastic polyps of the stomach have no coun￾terpart in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract and
are thereby organotypical.' I No comparison is poss￾ible with the adenomatous polyp in the colon. The
629
main importance of polyps lies in their possible
premalignant nature. There is, however, no agree￾ment with regard to the premalignant properties of
the hyperplastic polyp in the stomach. To evaluate
the primary occurrence of malignancy in and associ￾ated with the hyperplastic polyp, circumstantial
morphological evidence linking them to gastric car￾cinomas is needed.
Although more than half of the polyps were com￾posed of cells completely identical to the normal
gastric cells, nearly half (47%) of the polyps con￾tained other cytological elements. One atypical ele￾ment was the presence of intestinal type cells. This
must reflect intestinal metaplasia of the polyps.' The
occurrence of the intestinal metaplasia was only
local, however, and the metaplasia was incom￾plete.' 18 Tubules within the polyp become involved
in intestinal metaplasia less often than tubules out￾side the polyp.' 6 In this study we found two cases of
intestinal dysplasia and one case of intestinal type
adenocarcinoma. These lesions appear to be a
change related to intestinal metaplasia, similar to
the case in the gastric mucosa without polyps." " i3 It
must be emphasised, however, that intestinal type
neoplasias occur uncommonly in hyperplastic
polyps.
More commonly, we encountered gastric type
neoplasias in the hyperplastic polyps. We found nine
cases of dysplasia other than the intestinal type. The
dysplastic cells showed exclusively gastric charac￾teristics. The cancer cells closely resembled the
normal foveolar cells and contained neutral mucin.
No intestinal characteristics were found in the cells.
The adenocarcinomas were therefore of a gastric
type, and the adenocarcinomas and the dysplasias
were related. They might result from atypical foveo￾lar hyperplasia occurring in the polyps.' 6
In this study the incidence of adenocarcinomas
was 3/67. This value is similar to that reported by
Laxen et al4 and Tomasulo5; carcinomas were seen
in 2-6% of patients with polyps other than the
adenomatous ones. In previous studies78 20 car￾cinomas arising in hyperplastic polyps have often
been described as polyp carcinoma. Most of them
were papillary and tubular adenocarcinomas.
Accordingly, these have been considered as intesti￾nal type cancers, but a detailed study of gastric or
intestinal type features has not been performed.7 8 20
Some of the previously described polyp carcinomas
may well include gastric type adenocarcinoma.
From a histogenetic point of view, gastric cancers
have been classified into two main histological types:
a diffuse type and an intestinal type.9 21 The former
tends to occur in young patients. No precursor lesion
has been identified for this type.22 The latter is prone
to arise in the gastric mucosa with intestinal meta￾Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

plasia of old patients.'" 20
Other cancers include adenoacanthomas, car￾cinomas simplex, and undifferentiated car￾cinomas." 20 These cancers are rare, and their his￾togenesis has not been fully elucidated.
In addition, it remains uncertain whether or not
there is any other adenocarcinoma other than the
intestinal type, and whether or not carcinomas aris￾ing in the stomach without intestinal metaplasia are
exclusively of a diffuse type. In the present study
only gastric type adenocarcinoma was represented.
Gastric type adenocarcinomas may arise in the
gastric mucosa lacking hyperplastic polyps, when
foveolar hyperplasia takes place.23 Stump car￾cinomas in humans24 25 and gastric adenocarcinomas
in animals induced by chemical carcinogens26-28 (in
which intestinal characteristics are rarely seen)
might also represent gastric type neoplasias. In these
cancers foveolar hyperplasia rather than intestinal
metaplasia may be the lesion predisposing to the
development of carcinomas.24-28

Cancer Research from the Ministry of Education,
