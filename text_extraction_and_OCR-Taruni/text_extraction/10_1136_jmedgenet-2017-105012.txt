Abstract
Background Thymine kinase 2 (TK2) is a 
mitochondrial matrix protein encoded in nuclear 
DNA and phosphorylates the pyrimidine nucleosides: 
thymidine and deoxycytidine. Autosomal recessive 
TK2 mutations cause a spectrum of disease from 
infantile onset to adult onset manifesting primarily as 
myopathy.
Objective To perform a retrospective natural history 
study of a large cohort of patients with TK2 deficiency.
Methods The study was conducted by 42 investigators 
across 31 academic medical centres.
Results We identified 92 patients with genetically 
confirmed diagnoses of TK2 deficiency: 67 from 
literature review and 25 unreported cases. Based 
on clinical and molecular genetics findings, we 
recognised three phenotypes with divergent survival: 
(1) infantile-onset myopathy (42.4%) with severe 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, frequent 
neurological involvement and rapid progression to 
early mortality (median post-onset survival (POS) 
1.00, CI 0.58 to 2.33 years); (2) childhood-onset 
myopathy (40.2%) with mtDNA depletion, moderate￾to-severe progression of generalised weakness and 
median POS at least 13 years; and (3) late-onset 
myopathy (17.4%) with mild limb weakness at onset 
and slow progression to respiratory insufficiency with 
median POS of 23 years. Ophthalmoparesis and facial 
weakness are frequent in adults. Muscle biopsies 
show multiple mtDNA deletions often with mtDNA
depletion.
Conclusions In TK2 deficiency, age at onset, rate of 
weakness progression and POS are important variables 
that define three clinical subtypes. Nervous system 
involvement often complicates the clinical course of 
the infantile-onset form while extraocular muscle and 
facial involvement are characteristic of the late-onset 
form. Our observations provide essential information 
for planning future clinical trials in this disorder.
Introduction
Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a nuclear-encoded 
mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the conver￾sion of deoxycytidine and thymidine nucleosides to 
their nucleoside monophosphates that, in turn, are 
further phosphorylated to generate deoxynucleo￾side triphosphates that are incorporated into repli￾cating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Autosomal 
recessive deficiency of TK2 was initially described 
in 2001 by Saada and colleagues1
 in four children 
with severe myopathy, elevated creatine kinase, 
multiple defects of mitochondrial respiratory chain 
activity and low mtDNA copy number in muscle 
tissue. Since the original description of TK2 defi￾ciency, 63 additional patients have been described 
in isolated case reports and small series with hetero￾geneous clinical and molecular characteristics indi￾cating that TK2 deficiency encompasses a disease 
spectrum.2–25 The lack of a comprehensive study 
depicting the natural history and defining the clin￾ical, molecular and biochemical features has limited 
early recognition of the disease, prognostic infor￾mation for patients and families, and planning for 
potential future clinical trials.
Materials and methods
This multicentre retrospective study focuses on 
patients with TK2 deficiency. Informed consent 
for anonymous publication of the patients’ clinical 
features and analyses of DNA samples, skin-derived 
fibroblast cell lines and muscle tissues were obtained 
from all study participants under a Columbia 
University Medical Centre Institutional Review 
Board–approved protocol or local ethics committee 
approval of the referring clinical centre. Systematic 
literature review using the terms ‘Thymidine kinase 
2 deficiency’, ‘Thymidine kinase 2’ and ‘TK2’ from 
October 2001 to January 2016 was conducted in 
PubMed. Physicians caring for reported patients 
were invited to provide follow-up data and to

Phenotypes
contribute additional unreported cases with TK2 deficiency 
confirmed by molecular genetic testing. Mitochondrial disease 
research centres in Argentina (one), Chile (one), Finland (one), 
Italy (one), Spain (two), UK (three) and the USA (one) partici￾pated in the study. We collected the following information: age 
at onset, sign/symptoms, motor performance (maximal motor 
ability, age when wheelchair-bound, as well as severity and distri￾bution of weakness), respiratory involvement (use of non-in￾vasive ventilation and invasive ventilation), cardiomyopathy, 
bulbar involvement (gastrostomy, solid or liquid dysphagia, and 
facial weakness), central and peripheral nervous system involve￾ment (cognitive impairment, brain MRI abnormalities, enceph￾alopathy, seizures, motor neuron involvement and peripheral 
neuropathy), non-neurological signs/symptoms indicative of 
multisystemic involvement (kidney, heart, bone and liver abnor￾malities), survival, cause of death, serum creatine kinase (CK) 
levels, electromyography (EMG) studies and muscle histology 
and biochemistry.
Molecular genetic studies were performed in reference centres 
as previously described25–27: direct Sanger sequencing of TK2
(NM_004614.4) or next-generation whole-exome or mito￾chondrial nuclear gene panel sequencing for genetic diagnosis, 
long PCR or Southern blot analysis to detect multiple mtDNA 
deletions and quantitative PCR for mtDNA copy number in 
muscle tissue. TK2 activity was assessed in cultured fibroblasts 
of patients.
All statistical analysis was performed using SAS V.9.4. Clinical 
subgroup comparisons used 1 or 2 df χ2
 tests and survival anal￾yses employed log-rank or Wilcoxon tests, as appropriate.
Results
Clinical features
We identified and obtained natural history data for 92 patients 
(55 men, 37 women) with genetically confirmed diagnoses of 
TK2 deficiency (online supplementary tables 1–3). For 67 of 
these, who had been reported, data were obtained from litera￾ture review. For 25, previously unreported, data were provided 
by study contributors.
Age at disease onset ranged from birth to 72 years of age. We 
stratified patients into three groups based on onset age. Among 
the 90 for whom this was available, 39 (43.3%) had infan￾tile onset (≤1year), 37 (41.1%) childhood onset (>1and <12
years) and 14 (15.6%) late  onset (>12 years). In all but one
of the late-onset group, initial manifestations presented after 
adolescence (>17 years). The proportions of male and female
patients in the three groups did not differ significantly (P=0.46, 
2 df χ2
 test).
All patients had proximal muscle weakness as the first sign 
of disease or during the clinical course. CK levels, available 
in 57 out of 92 patients, were elevated in all from 1.3-fold to 
30-fold above the upper limit of normal (range 272–6500U/L). 
In five patients, CK levels were reportedly increased, but values 
were not available. In seven patients (two infantile-onset, four 
childhood-onset and one late-onset disease), CK values were 
transiently in the normal range. CK elevation was associated 
with myoglobinuria (one) and rhabdomyolysis (two). Nerve 
conduction studies (NCSs) and EMG were performed in 42 
patients, and results classified as myopathic changes defined by 
polyphasic short-duration low-amplitude motor unit potentials 
(MUPs) in 33/42 (78.6%), ‘myopathic and neuropathic’ changes 
in 3/42 (7.2%), sensory axonal neuropathy by NCS in one 
(2.4%), chronic denervation by EMG in another patient (2.4%), 
low-amplitude MUPs in a facial muscle in one patient (2.4%), 
isolated ‘neuropathic’ changes in 3/42 (7.1%), sensory axonal 
peripheral neuropathy in one (2.4%) and no abnormalities in 
three patients (7.1%). Although neurogenic abnormalities were 
detected in 6/34 (17.6%) electrophysiological studies, only two 
patients had sensory peripheral neuropathy.
Global motor function was severely impaired in 50/61 (82% 
with Karnofsky or Lansky Performance Status <50) who were
wheelchair-bound at the last follow-up. Eleven patients (three 
children, nine adults; 18%) had motor function compatible with 
nearly normal daily life at last follow-up; they were able to walk 
short distances independently, climb stairs or both. Data from 
motor rating scales were not available for 31 patients. Muscle 
weakness was most prominent in the first year of life in the 
infantile-onset form, with 26 of 32 (81%) never acquiring the 
ability to walk independently and virtually all (30/32; 94%) 
non-ambulatory by age 4 years, with only one still walking at age 
4 years and another as an adult3
 (data were not available in seven 
patients). In contrast, 19/30 (63%) of childhood-onset patients 
became wheelchair-bound within 10 years of disease onset 
except for two patients; one was ambulatory until age 15 (11 
years after onset) and the other walked until age 22 (20 years 
after onset).13 Of the ambulatory childhood-onset patients, the 
majority (8/11, 64%) were within 10 years of disease onset, but 
four were walking more than 10 years after onset at ages 15 
(11 years post-onset), 25 (23.5 years post-onset), 28 (19 years 
post-onset) and 29 years (27.9 years post-onset) (data were not 
available in seven patients). In contrast to the infantile-onset/
childhood-onset patients, late-onset cases never became wheel￾chair-bound (data were not available in eight patients).
Respiratory muscles were severely compromised in 33/51 
(65%) patients, who required mechanical ventilation or 
nocturnal/continuous non-invasive ventilation (data were not 
available in 41 patients). The vast majority of infantile-onset 
patients required ventilation (17/19, 89.5%) while ventilatory 
support was used in about half the childhood-onset (12/22, 
54.4%) and late-onset (4/9, 44.4%) patients.
Other muscular functions were affected in 33/85 (39%) 
patients who manifested variable combinations of ptosis (22), 
facial diplegia (19), progressive external ophthalmoparesis 
(PEO) (11), mild dysphagia (10), dysarthria/dysphonia (3) and 
rigid spine (1) (figure 1A). Nineteen patients required gastros￾tomy tube because of severe dysphagia, failure to thrive or 
both. The nervous system was affected in 15 out of 92 (16%) 
causing recurrent seizures (six), encephalopathy (seven), cogni￾tive impairment (four), sensorineural hearing loss (three) and 
episodic coma (one). As previously reported, abnormalities in 
the cerebral or cerebellar hemispheres such as atrophy (three), 
immature myelination (one) and lissencephaly (one) were identi￾fied on brain MRI or histological postmortem studies.5 8
Data on mortality are available for 79 individuals: 37 infantile, 
35 childhood and 8 late onset. Because data for the late-onset 
group are sparse and because their survival does not differ from 
the childhood-onset group (P=0.84 by Wilcoxon test), we have 
combined these in a childhood-onset/late-onset group, which 
figure 1B compares with the infantile-onset group. Survival 
differs significantly (P<0.0001 by log-rank test). Median post￾onset survival (POS) is 1.0 years (CI 0.58 to 2.33) for the infan￾tile group and at least 23.0years (CI 10.0 to incomputable) for 
the childhood-onset/late-onset group. Separate comparisons of 
POS of the childhood-onset and late-onset group to the infan￾tile-onset group are provided in online supplemental figure 
1A,B. Both comparisons are significant (P<0.01). Median POS
is not directly estimable for the childhood group (online supple￾mental figure 1A). We infer that it is  >13 years since that is

the 40th percentile value. Median POS for the late-onset group 
(online supplemental figure 1B) is 23.0 years, with a very wide 
CI, given so few cases (0.0 to incalculable).
Because 27.2% (25 of 92) of the patients are known to have 
died from respiratory failure, we also analysed time to venti￾lation or death (‘event-free survival’, figure 1C). The data are 
limited because time to ventilation use is not available for some 
patients. Time from onset to ventilation or death is significantly 
greater for the childhood-onset/late-onset group (P≤0.0001 for
log-rank test). Median time to event is 1.67 (CI 0.11 to 2.33) 
years for infantile onset and 10.00 (CI 3.50 to 22.00) years for 
childhood/late onset.
Molecular genetics and biochemical studies
Levels of mtDNA in muscle were measured in 71 patients and 
showed significant depletion (<30% residual mtDNA relative
to age-matched control subjects) in 47 (66%). Higher propor￾tions of infantile-onset (21/26; 81%) and childhood-onset
(24/31; 77%) had mtDNA depletion than late onset (1/14; 
7%) (P≤0.0001 for late-onset vs others, 1 df χ2
 test). Multiple 
mtDNA deletions were detected in muscle of 24 patients 
primarily in late-onset patients: infantile-onset (1/8; 12.5%), 
childhood-onset (7/14; 50%) and late-onset (16/16; 100%). 
The proportions with multiple mtDNA deletions differed 
significantly over the three groups (P≤0.001, 2 df χ2
 test).
Pathogenic variants were identified in all exons of TK2
and no clear genotype–phenotype correlation was apparent. 
The most common mutation, p.Thr108Met, was identified in 
a homozygous state in 13 patients with heterogeneous clin￾ical phenotypes (three infantile-onset, six childhood-onset 
and four late-onset individuals) (figure 2). The substrate 
binding site (encoded by exon 5) and active site (exon 8) are 
hotspots for the mutations. We identified 11 novel mutations 
affecting highly conserved amino acid residues, splice site 
regions or a reading frame (p.Lys50Ilefr99*, p.Arg104His, 
p.Thr116Ile, p.His121Asp, p.Met132Thr, p.Ala139Thr, 
c.156+6T>G, p.Asp157Valfs11*, p.His163Asp, p.Ile212Val
and p.Gln125His); all were predicted to be deleterious by
PolyPhen-2, SIFT or both.
TK2 activity measured in 11 patient-derived fibroblast cell 
lines showed residual activity ranging from 1% to 39% relative 
to healthy controls without correlation with clinical severity 
(online supplementary table 4).
Muscle biopsy
Muscle biopsy samples, obtained in 83 patients, were subjected 
to a variety of diagnostic tests. Histochemical, histological, 
biochemical and molecular genetics analyses had been prioritised 
and performed based on the differential diagnosis of mitochon￾drial versus other metabolic or congenital myopathies thereby 
limiting the opportunity to compare all tests within individual 
patients.
Muscle histology data were available in 36 patients. Myop￾athic changes included atrophic and/or necrotic fibres (28/36, 
69.5%), fibre size variability/type 1 predominance (24/36, 
66.6%), increased central nuclei (11/36, 30.5%), sarcoplasmic 
vacuoles (5/36, 13.9%), lipid droplets or fat replacement of 
muscle tissue (7/36, 19.5%), and fibrosis or increase of connec￾tive tissue (14/36, 38.9%). Muscle histochemistry was abnormal 
in all 71 patients studied: 53/71 (74.6%) had numerous 
cytochrome c oxidase (COX)–deficient and ragged-red 
fibres (RRFs), 14/71 (19.7%) had only COX-deficient fibres 
and 4/71 (5.7%) had isolated RRFs. Oxidative-phosphorylation 
(OXPHOS) enzyme activities were measured in muscle of 48 
patients. Multiple OXPHOS defects were identified in 35/48 
(73%) while single enzyme abnormalities were detected in 7/48 
(14.5%) (complex IV deficiency in 4/49, complex III in 1/48, 
isolated increase of citrate synthase in 1/48 and complex I in 
1/48). In six patients (12.5%) with childhood-onset (two) and 
late-onset (four) myopathies, OXPHOS activities were normal.
Classification
Based on clinical, biochemical and molecular genetics 
features, we identified three clinical forms of TK2 deficiency

Phenotypes
(online supplementary tables 1–3) that we defined by the 
following criteria:
Infantile-onset myopathy
defined by onset in the first year of life (mean 0.53±SD 0.32), 
rapidly progressive myopathy, with or without encephalopathy 
and severe muscle mtDNA depletion. In our cohort of patients, 
39 (42.4%) patients fulfilled criteria for TK2 infantile myopathy. 
Severe congenital myopathy and hypotonia or motor regression 
progressed rapidly to fatality in the majority of cases within 
1year of follow-up due to respiratory failure (figure 1B). Virtu￾ally all never developed the ability to walk or became wheel￾chair-bound by age 4 years (94%) and 89% required ventilator 
support. Additional clinical manifestations were seizures (seven), 
encephalopathy (five), lissencephaly (one), cognitive dysfunction 
(three), ptosis (four), facial diplegia (three), dysphagia (three) 
and multiple bone fractures (two). Single patients presented with 
each of the following clinical abnormalities: nephropathy, rigid 
spine, coma episodes, cardiomyopathy, bi-ventricular hyper￾trophy, arrhythmia, oesophageal atresia, microcephaly, bilateral 
optic atrophy, severe peripartum asphyxia, anaemia, thrombosis, 
capillary-leak syndrome, bilateral chylothorax and occipital skin 
necrosis. Overall, 13/39 (33.3%) infantile-onset patients had 
non-skeletal muscle manifestations while 10/39 (25.6%) had 
central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities.
Childhood-onset myopathy
delineated by childhood-onset (>1and  <12 years), moder￾ately to rapidly progressive myopathy, and muscle mtDNA 
depletion with, in some cases, multiple deletions. All patients 
fulfilled criteria for childhood limb myopathy with proximal 
weakness, Gower signs and myopathic histological changes, 
but some also manifested facial diplegia (11), ptosis (9), PEO 
(3) and dysphagia (1). The weakness occasionally resembled 
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3 with progressive clinical 
course to wheelchair-bound status in the majority (60%) and 
invasive or non-invasive ventilator dependency in 55% (12/22). 
A minority (7/37, 18.9%) of the patients showed non-skeletal 
muscle involvement including hearing loss (two), as well as one 
each with cognitive decline, encephalopathy, prolonged QT, 
arrhythmia, multiple bone fractures, renal tubulopathy and 
gynaecomastia. Nervous system involvement was evident in 
4/37 (10.8%) patients.
Late-onset myopathy
defined by myopathy that clearly manifests at age ≥12 years with
mtDNA depletion, multiple deletions or both in muscle. Sixteen 
patients (17.4%) in our cohort presented with adult-onset 
myopathy, which mimicked facioscapulohumeral dystrophy 
with marked facial weakness, scapular winging or both in seven 
(43.75%). In retrospect, subtle signs of myopathy were often 
present in childhood (eg, slow running) but did not prompt 
medical evaluation until adulthood. All patients retained the 
ability to walk, but 4/9 (44.4%) used ventilator support. Addi￾tional manifestations were ptosis (nine), PEO (eight), dysphagia 
(six), dysarthria/dysphonia (three), respiratory insufficiency 
(five), cardiomyopathy (two) and one each with peripheral 
neuropathy and hearing loss. Non-muscle manifestations were 
present in 4/16 (25%), but none had CNS abnormalities.

Phenotypes
Discussion
A growing number of mitochondrial diseases with mtDNA 
instability have been linked to mitochondrial deoxynucleotide 
pool imbalance, including deficiencies of TK2, dGK, RRM2B 
or TYMP. For these disorders, treatment with nucleotides/nucle￾osides has ameliorated phenotypic and biochemical abnormali￾ties in cellular and animal models.28–31 An understanding of the 
natural history of deoxynucleotide pool imbalance disorders is 
essential if these treatments are to be tested effectively in clinical 
trials. We have retrospectively documented the manifestations 
and natural history of TK2 deficiency in a cohort of 92 patients, 
including 25 recently diagnosed.
The disease presents predominantly as a myopathy with a 
wide spectrum of age at onset and severity.
We have confirmed the phenotypic heterogeneity of TK2 defi￾ciency and divided the spectrum into three major clinical forms: 
(1) infantile-onset myopathy evident in the first year of life with 
rapid progression to early death; (2) childhood-onset myopathy 
with proximal limb weakness progressing, in most cases, to loss 
of ambulation within 10 years of disease onset and ventilator 
use; and (3) late-onset myopathy with subclinical or mild myop￾athy at disease onset in adolescence through adulthood and 
slow progression with retained ability to walk but requirement 
of ventilator support in nearly half. Infantile-onset and child￾hood-onset myopathies were the most common clinical pheno￾types accounting for 82% of TK2-deficient patients. Although 
accounting for a small minority of the patients (18%), the late￾onset form has been only recently associated with TK2 mutations 
and therefore may be under-represented.
We identified three important features that enable stratifi￾cation of TK2-deficient patients: (1) age at onset, (2) rate of 
muscle weakness progression and (3) post-onset survival. POS 
was dramatically shorter in the infantile-onset form compared 
with the childhood-onset/late-onset forms (median 1 vs 23 
years). Muscle weakness was evident in the first year of life in 
the infantile-onset form with 26 of 32 (81%) never acquiring 
the ability to walk independently and virtually all (30/32; 94%) 
were non-ambulatory by age 4 years. In contrast, 19 of 30 (63%) 
of childhood-onset patients became wheelchair-bound whereas 
late-onset cases never became wheelchair-bound. Therefore, 
length of survival and progression of muscle weakness, reflected 
by capacity to ambulate, represents important clinical features 
for the evaluation of treatment efficacy in future clinical trials.
The range of weakness severity among TK2-deficient patients 
parallels the spectrum of SMA with infantile-onset TK2 myop￾athy resembling SMA type 1 and severe type 2, childhood-onset 
myopathy similar to milder type 2 and 3a SMA, and late-onset 
myopathy comparable to SMA types 3b and IV, although the 
weakness is more progressive.10 28 32 Genetic screening for TK2 
deficiency must be considered in children, particularly infants, 
with rapidly progressing muscle weakness, especially when asso￾ciated with elevated blood lactate and CK.
The adult myopathy shares prominent facial weakness with 
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).18 29 We 
suggest that genetically undiagnosed patients with autosomal 
recessive myopathies, including FSHD-like cases, should be 
screened for TK2 mutations in blood or mitochondrial alter￾ations in muscle biopsies.
While hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness are common 
in all of the three clinical forms, the involvement of ocular 
muscles with ptosis or PEO is more frequent in late-onset cases 
(11/16, 68.7%) than in the childhood-onset (11/37, 29.7%) 
and infantile-onset forms (3/39, 7.7%). Therefore, extraocular 
muscle involvement is much more characteristic of TK2 late￾onset form. Non-muscle manifestations noted in 27.2% of 
patients (25/92) were mostly CNS or peripheral nervous system 
involvement, cardiopathy and bone fractures. Interestingly, CNS 
signs are more frequent and severe in the infantile form with 
10/39 patients (25.6%) manifesting as encephalopathy, seizures 
or cognitive impairment; however, due to the high frequency of 
restrictive lung disease, it is uncertain in some cases whether the 
cerebral manifestations might have been due to hypoxic–isch￾aemic damage in the setting of respiratory failure or infections. 
Nevertheless, these data indicate the importance of a multisys￾temic evaluation of patients with infantile-onset form for clinical 
care and interventional trials.
Skeletal muscle biopsies showed mtDNA defects ranging from 
severe mtDNA depletion in the infantile-onset and childhood-onset 
myopathies to partial mtDNA copy number reduction or multiple 
mtDNA deletions in isolation in the late-onset myopathy. Although 
a few TK2 mutations were associated with specific clinical forms (eg, 
frameshift mutation in exons 2 and 3 in infantile-onset cases and 
p.Arg90Cys in late-onset myopathy) (figure 2), 12 mutations were 
associated with multiple phenotypes so overall genotype–phenotype 
correlations based on type of mutation and protein location could 
not be clearly delineated. Based on the genomic localisation of the 
variants, we confirmed exon 5 as a hot spot20 and identified exon 8 
as a second frequent location for TK2 mutations. Exon 5 encodes the 
α4 helix, which is required for enzyme dimerisation and nucleoside 
recognition in the deoxynucleoside kinase domain. Exon 8 encodes 
the α8 helix, an integral component of the lid region required for 
binding of phosphate groups of ATP and catalysis.9 14 20
Although progressive proximal muscle weakness was uniformly 
present in all three clinical forms of TK2 deficiency, the myop￾athy manifested variable severity and functional impairment. The 
majority of the patients also had respiratory muscle weakness, 
which was the most common cause of death. Reduced total VC 
was identified in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In 
some patients with late-onset myopathy, nocturnal dyspnoea was 
an initial symptom of the disease.
CK levels were elevated (272–6500U/L) in 57 TK2-deficient 
patients and normal in only five: one with infantile-onset myop￾athy and four with childhood-onset myopathy, indicating that a 
normal CK does not exclude TK2 deficiency. Myoglobinuria and 
rhabdomyolysis were rare (three patients).
EMG revealed myopathic changes in 78.6% of patients tested. 
Surprisingly, neurogenic changes were detected in six patients 
including two with sensory axonal peripheral neuropathy. 
One was a 58-year-old man with symptomatic sensory axonal 
neuropathy, but also signs of myopathy including axial and prox￾imal limb weakness, PEO and pulmonary function tests indi￾cating restrictive lung disease; and one an infantile patient with a 
severe multisystemic disorder. Other medical conditions causing 
peripheral neuropathy were excluded in these patients. These 
data demonstrate peripheral nerve involvement in a minority of 
patients with TK2 deficiency.
Results of routine muscle histology were available in 36 patients; 
in the majority of samples, myopathic changes (69.5%) and fat/
connective replacement (38.9%) were noted. Histochemical data 
were available in 77% of patients confirming COX deficiency with 
or without RRFs as morphological hallmarks of TK2 deficiency. 
In 87.5% of the biopsies, biochemical activities of respiratory 
chain enzymes were reduced with isolated complex IV deficiency 
or variable defects of complexes I, III and IV. The combination of 
dystrophic features with COX defect and RRF is highly suggestive 
of TK2 deficiency, but must be supplemented by molecular genetic 
studies to confirm TK2 deficiency.

Phenotypes
In conclusion, TK2 deficiency is a frequent mitochondrial 
predominantly myopathic disorder that may be under-diagnosed 
due to its diverse spectrum of clinical presentations. Our study 
provides diagnostic clinical and molecular genetic criteria and 
describes additional phenotypic features, as well as outcomes, that 
are important for early and accurate diagnosis and optimal manage￾ment of this disease. Greater awareness of diagnostic criteria and 
the variability of clinical manifestations may lead to increased 
recognition of the disorder, which is particularly important as 
preclinical studies of pyrimidine deoxynucleoside monophos￾phates and deoxynucleoside therapies have demonstrated safety 
and efficacy in a Tk2 H126N knockin mouse model.30 31
