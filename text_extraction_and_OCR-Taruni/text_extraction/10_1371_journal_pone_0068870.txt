Abstract
Background and objectives: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in CKD is associated with an increased risk for
mortality, but definitive data showing that parathormone control decreases mortality is still lacking. This study aimed to
compare the mortality of patients with severe SHPT submitted to parathyroidectomy(PTX) with those who did not have
access to surgery.
Methods: This is a retrospective study in a cohort of 251 CKD patients with severe SHPT who were referred to a CKD-MBD
Center for PTX from 2005 until 2012.
Results: Most of our patients had indication of PTX, but only 49% of them had access to this surgical procedure. After a
mean follow-up of 23 months, 72 patients had died. Non-survivors were older; more often had diabetes, lower serum 25
vitamin D and mostly had not been submitted to surgery. The relative risk of death was lower in the PTX patients (0.428;
95% CI, 0.28 to 0.67; p,0.0001). After adjustments, mortality risk was dependent on age (1.04; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.07;
p = 0.002), 25 vitamin D (0.43; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81; p = 0.006) and no access to PTX (4.13; 95% CI, 2.16 to 7.88; p,0.0001).
Results remained the same in a second model using the PTX date as the study start date for the PTX group.
Conclusions: Our data confirms the benefit of PTX on mortality in patients with severe SHPT. The high mortality
encountered in our population is significant and urges the need to better treat these patients.

Introduction
Mineral and bone metabolism disorders (CKD-MBD) are found
almost universally in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
requiring dialysis. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is one
of the most important and well-recognized of these disorders and
data from observational studies have shown that CKD patients
presenting high levels of serum parathormone (PTH) have an
increased risk for mortality, as well as a higher morbidity
[1,2,3].The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study
(DOPPS) is the most important ongoing observational study and
its results indicated that serum PTH higher than 600 pg/ml was
associated with a 21% increase in all-cause mortality risk [3].
However, most of these observational studies compared patients
with high levels of PTH with those presenting adequate levels of
this hormone [4,5] raising the question whether this mortality is
related to SHPT itself or to other associated risk-factors. In
addition, data that shows that controlling PTH in dialysis patients
decreases mortality is still lacking [6], since most of the studies
compared different strategies of therapy for SHPT, considering
that not offering any therapeutic strategy would be considered as
non-ethical.
Currently in Brazil, approximately 90,000 patients are being
treated with dialysis, most of them reimbursed by the public health
system [7]. Serum PTH is measured only two times per year and
the current therapy for SHPT provided by this public system is
calcium-based phosphate binders and calcitriol. Sevelamer is
offered only to patients who present sustained hypercalcemia and
paricalcitol or cinacalcet are not available yet. The consequence is
that a significant proportion of our patients develop severe forms
of SHPT and the only option for their therapy is surgical
parathyroidectomy (PTX). However, few services in our country
perform this surgery, leading to a waiting list in the reference
centers, which is, at the biggest University in Latin America, of
563 days. This dramatic condition gave us the unique opportunity
to test the hypothesis whether SHPT therapy, in this case through

PdF

surgical PTX, is able to decrease mortality. To that end, we
prospectively followed dialysis patients that were referred to our
center for PTX and compared the mortality of those that were
submitted to PTX with those who did not have access to this
surgical therapy over time.
Materials and Methods
This historical analytical cohort encompassed CKD patients
who attended the CKD-MBD clinic in a tertiary care hospital in
Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Hospital das Clı´nicas da Faculdade de Medicina
da Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo), from January 1, 2005 to
December 31, 2009.This service is a reference center that receives
patients from different dialysis services in Sa˜o Paulo area for
further evaluation and treatment. After excluding kidney trans￾plant and predialysis patients, 300 individuals on dialysis were
evaluated. Those patients that on initial evaluation had serum
levels of intact PTH greater than 800 pg/ml on calcitriol or in the
presence of hyperphosphatemia and/or hypercalcemia, which
prevented the use of calcitriol, were considered as having
refractory hyperparathyroidism and were referred to surgical
PTX (n = 251). Patients selected for PTX were then entered in a
waiting list according to the chronological order. A flow chart of
the study design is shown in Figure 1. Even though the original

Improved Survival after Parathyroidectomy

criterion for surgery was time on the waiting list, the severity of
symptoms (such as worsening of pain, tendon rupture, new
fractures) was actually a main guide to anticipate surgery.
Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation in the
forearm is the procedure of choice at our Institution. Intraoper￾ative PTH levels were obtained before and after resection of each
enlarged parathyroid gland with the goal to attain a final
intraoperative PTH less than 100 pg/mL.
All patients of this cohort were followed until March 1, 2012,
when a survival analysis was performed. Clinical assessments were
performed on all patients. At baseline, serum PTH, total calcium,
ionized calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D
levels and medical record was queried.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Hospital das Clı´nicas da Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo. As this was a
retrospective study, our University Ethics Committee did not
require an informed consent.
All data are expressed as mean 6 SD for normally distributed
data, median (min-max) for skewed data, and frequency (%) for
categorical data. Comparisons between continuous variables and
categorical variables were made using the t-test and chi-square
test, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the
estimation of survival, and differences between the curves (PTX
and non-PTX groups) were compared using the log-rank test.
Data for survival analysis were censored at the time of renal
transplantation or end of study (March 1st, 2012). Forward
Stepwise (Likelihood Ratio) cox proportional hazards regression
analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of non-PTX in
the risk of death (variables in the model: sex, age, PTX, diabetes
and 25 vitamin D). Lastly we performed a second analysis to
exclude the ‘‘immortal time’’ bias, using the PTX date as the study
start date for the PTX group. The same variables were entered on
the adjusted models. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
17.0.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) and Graphpad prism 5 (CA, USA).
A two-sided P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
As shown in Table 1, patients that were referred to our center
were relatively young, with a mean age of 47.9613.5 years, with a
slight predominance of men. We also had few diabetics, but more
than 50% were hypertensive. Most had elevated ionized calcium
and phosphate, as well as high alkaline phosphatase. Median PTH
was high, whereas median 25 vitamin D was lower than normal
[defined as $30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L)] and 22% of the patients
were considered as having vitamin D deficiency [defined as
,15 ng/ml (45 nmol/L), whereas vitamin D insufficiency was
defined as serum 25 vitamin D levels between 15 and 30 ng/ml)].
Patients were symptomatic, as confirmed by the presence of
continuous pain in more than 60% of them, although self-referred
fracture was detected only in 13%. The only affordable therapy,
calcitriol, was being used in 40% of the patients.
Most of the patients (84.2%) had indication of PTX. When
compared to those that did not need PTX, we could observe that
these patients with refractory hyperparathyroidism presented
higher serum phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and serum PTH.
They were also more symptomatic and had been on dialysis
therapy during a longer period of time (Table 2).
After a mean follow-up of 23 months, only 123 out of the 251
patients with indication of PTX were submitted to this surgical
procedure. We observed that 72 patients from this group of
refractory hyperparathyroidism died [21 in the group that was
submitted to PTX (7 deaths per 100 patient-year and 51 in the
group that did not have access to the surgery (16 deaths per 100
patient-year); p,0.0001]. To better understand the factors that
could be associated with an increased risk of death in this
population of patients with severe hyperparathyroidism, we
compared survivors and non-survivors, as shown in Table 3.
The first group was younger, with a higher prevalence of males,
and less frequently had diabetes. Ionized calcium, phosphate,
alkaline phosphatase, as well as serum PTH were not able to
differentiate groups. However, mean 25 vitamin D was lower in
the non-survivor group, as well as the prevalence of patients that
were submitted to PTX. We could also observe that the mortality

rates were 19.4%, 30.7% and 47.5% in vitamin D replete,
insufficient and deficient patients, respectively. However, a
significant difference in terms of mortality was found only between
the first and last groups of patients. Conversely, we could not find
any beneficial effect of calcitriol on survival, since mortality rates
were of 27.2% and 27.1% in patients that have been treated or not
with this drug, respectively, at the time they were referred to our
center.
The comparison between patients submitted to PTX to those
who did not have the chance to undergo surgery disclosed that the
first group was younger and less frequently diabetic; however, they
were more symptomatic, more often referring pain and fractures
(Table 4). They also had higher serum calcium, phosphate,
alkaline phosphatase and PTH and a longer dialysis vintage,
turning them into more seriously ill patients. The analysis of the
relative risk of death showed that it was lower in the PTX group
than in the non-PTX group (0.428; 95% confidence interval, 0.28
to 0.67; p,0.0001).
Survival curve showed a benefit of PTX, as depicted in Figure 2
(log-rank test p,0.0001). In unadjusted model the relative hazard
in the non-PTX group vs. the PTX group was 4.13; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 2.46 to 6.92; p = 0.0001. After adjust￾ment for age, gender and presence of DM, mortality risk was
dependent on age (1.06; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.08; p,0.0001) and no
access to PTX (3.91; 95% CI, 2.30 to 6.66; p,0.0001). After
adjustment for age, gender, DM and 25 vitamin D, the variables
that remained significant were age (1.04; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.07;
p = 0.002), 25 vitamin D (0.43; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81; p = 0.006)
and no-PTX (4.13; 95% CI, 2.16 to 7.88; p,0.0001). Finally, we
performed another multivariable analysis, in order to rule out the
‘‘immortal time’’ bias, and we observed that the relative hazard in
the non-PTX group vs. the PTX group was 2.5, 2.2 and 2.4 using
the same models described before (Figure 3). Therefore, the
benefits of PTX were still confirmed in this unique population with
severe form of hyperparathyroidism.
Discussion
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common compli￾cation in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Conventional medical
therapy with first generation of vitamin D receptor activators
(VDRAs), such as calcitriol and alfacalcidol, lack adequate long￾term control of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in a large
group of patients, resulting in vascular calcification [8] and an
increase of cardiovascular mortality [9].
The exact mechanisms by which altered mineral metabolism
increases mortality and morbidity remain unclear, but vascular
calcification has been proposed as a possible link [8,10]. It has
been described that serum phosphorus stimulates the transforma￾tion of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like cells,
creating an environment susceptible to calcification [11,12].
Similarly, hypercalcemia and uremia cause vascular calcification
by active processes suggesting the importance of strict manage￾ment of uremia, serum minerals and PTH in dialysis patients
[8,13,14].
Parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients who
become resistant to medical therapy. A small clinical study has
shown slowing of calcification progression after PTX [15], but
there has been a few reports of improved survival post-PTX
[16,17,18]. This surgical procedure seems to improve high blood
pressure, anemia, nutritional state, immunity, glucose and lipid
metabolism, muscle strength and quality of life, relieves insomnia
and even increases cognitive function [19,20,21,22,23].
The mechanisms responsible for these remarkable beneficial
effects of PTX are not certain; however, the dramatic reductions
in PTH and better control of serum minerals are certainly
involved. Iwamoto et al [4] performed a retrospective comparison
of survival and mineral metabolism between 88 patients who had
undergone PTX and 88 control dialysis patients with no indication
of PTX. The overall survival rate was 90.4% in the PTX group
and 67.4% in the control group, whereas the cardiovascular death￾free survival rate was significantly better in the PTX group (94.6%
versus 76.3%). They found that besides reducing PTH, calcium
levels were significantly lower in the PTX group compared to the
control group and suggested that these efects could contribute to
the decrease of cardiac afterload and inhibition of the further
progression of vascular calcification resulting in a better prognosis
of this group of patients. Sharma et al also have described an
overall improvement in mortality from cardiovascular diseases in
86 patients who had this time undergone near total parathyroid￾ectomy compared to matched controls [5]. However, both of them
performed retrospective studies and their control group was
composed of dialysis patients with no indication of PTX, which
makes the groups distinct, and the presence of other confounding
factors contributing to this benefit of PTX could not be ruled out.
In our center, although more than two surgeries were
performed each month, the number of patients referred to us
and the mean time on waiting list were astoundingly elevated. As a
consequence, sometimes we had to anticipate surgery in those
patients that were more symptomatic and severely ill. The final
result is that the group that was submitted to PTX was younger,
but with a more severe manifestation of SHPT. Nevertheless, the
adjusted survival curve was able to confirm the benefit of therapy
in this group of patients that currently is rarely seen in the US,
Japan or Western Europe.
During the follow up, we found a mortality rate of 29% in the
group patients with refractory hyperparathyroidism, which was
even higher in the group of patients who needed, but was not
submitted to PTX (40%). The median non-PTX patients’ follow￾up time was shorter than PTX patients’ follow-up time (493 vs.
763 days; p = 0.15), but did not reach statistical significance. If we
considered the PTX date as the study start date for the PTX
group, the results basically remained the same, although the HR of
mortality for non-PTX group had diminished from 4.0 (as
previously showed) to 2.4 (unadjusted) and 2.1 (adjusted for age,
gender and presence of diabetes).
Kestenbaum et al [24] have demonstrated that long-term
relative risks of death among patients undergoing PTX were
estimated to be 10% to 15% lower than those of matched control
patients not undergoing surgery. Median survival was higher in
the PTX group than in matched control group. Although these
authors also found a benefit of PTX, this study differs from ours in
several aspects: first, the control group did not have indication for
PTX; second, the patients had full access to medication; third, the
PTX was not delayed due to extensive waiting list; finally, the
above mentioned study compared patients and controls from
many centers, which may have some difference in clinical
approach, as well as indication of PTX. The more pronounced

benefit of PTX in our study is probably related to the differences
mentioned above.
When we compared survivors and non-survivors we could
observe that survivors were younger and mostly males with less
frequent diabetes. Interestingly, neither serum minerals not even
PTH was able to differentiate groups. On the other hand,
parathyroidectomy and mean levels of 25 vitamin D were crucial
to differentiate the group of survivors versus non-survivors. This
association of serum 25 vitamin D and survival has already been
shown in other studies [25,26]. In our study, we could observe a
progressive increase in mortality rate as the serum levels of 25
vitamin D decreased. However, a significant difference in terms of
mortality was found only between vitamin D replete in compar￾ison to vitamin D deficient patients. Curiously, after the initial
evaluation, all patients with hypovitaminosis D were prescribed
with cholecalciferol, what would normalize their vitamin D status,
at least in theory. Another interesting finding is related to the
absence of any significant effect of calcitriol administration on
mortality. Previous studies have shown that active vitamin D
administration decreases mortality in dialysis patients with
hypovitaminosis D [25]. However, in our sample, mortality rates
were similar between those treated or not with calcitriol. One
possible explanation is that those non-classical benefits of calcitriol
therapy could not be observed in these patients with a severe form
of SHPT.
In the literature, there is still an intense debate on the better
strategy for SHPT management. Some authors believe that it
should start with VDRAs [27], whereas others prefer calcimi￾metics [28]. A recent published study, which compared the effects
of calcimimetics with conventional therapy with VDRAs, showed
inconclusive results [29]. Curiouslly, one possible explanation for
the EVOLVE disappointing results was the high rate of PTX in
the control group, which might have decreased the number of
events in those patients, i.e. the effect of cinacalcet could be
masked by that imbalance in PTx between groups. A dangerous
conclusion that might be drawn from the EVOLVE results [6] is
to whether there is any benefit of cinacalcet or any SHPT therapy
in terms of mortality and morbidity. Our data, generated from a
critical situation in the Brazilian health system comes to confirm
that not giving any therapeutic option to these patients increases
significantly their risk of death. In Brazil and other developing
countries, dialysis is affordable for most of the CKD patients and
this could give them a chance to a better survival. However, if this
access to dialysis does not come with medical therapy for CKD￾MBD and other CKD complications, our patients will still be
exposed to a high risk of mortality, as well as of fractures and pain.
One piece of information that could not be given by our data is
whether surgical PTX is better than current conservative therapy,
which includes new generations of VDRAs and calcimimetics,
since any of our patients have the opportunitty to be treated with
these drugs.
This work has several limitations. The number of patients is
relatively small; this is a cohort study, in which patients were not
randomized to treatment with PTX or not, and the more seriously
ill were eventually submitted to surgery before. Like other
observational studies, the present data is also prone to selection
bias, implying the risk of residual confounding. Additional
limitations are some unmeasured patient characteristics, such as
serum 25 vitamin D and presence of undetected clinical
comorbidities, which limit the adjustments and inferences that
can be made. Notwithstanding, we had the unique opportunity to
have a control group of real life with indication, but no therapy to
their disease, which would not be accepted in a classical clinical
study. We believe that the high mortality encountered in our
population is significant and urges the need to treat these patients.
Conclusion
The definitive information that we can provide is that, although
being seriously ill, symptomatic, with high serum phosphorus, very
elevated PTH and low vitamin D, in an extreme situation, our
patients were clearly benefited from PTX.
