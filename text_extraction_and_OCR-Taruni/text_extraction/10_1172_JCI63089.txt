Although long considered a promising treatment option for type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islet cell transforma￾tion has been hindered by immune system rejection of engrafted tissue. The identification of pathways that 
regulate post-transplant detrimental inflammatory events would improve management and outcome of trans￾planted patients. Here, we found that CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors and their ligands are crucial negative 
determinants for islet survival after transplantation. Pancreatic islets released abundant CXCR1/2 ligands 
(CXCL1 and CXCL8). Accordingly, intrahepatic CXCL1 and circulating CXCL1 and CXCL8 were strongly 
induced shortly after islet infusion. Genetic and pharmacological blockade of the CXCL1-CXCR1/2 axis in 
mice improved intrahepatic islet engraftment and reduced intrahepatic recruitment of polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes and NKT cells after islet infusion. In humans, the CXCR1/2 allosteric inhibitor reparixin improved 
outcome in a phase 2 randomized, open-label pilot study with a single infusion of allogeneic islets. These 
findings indicate that the CXCR1/2-mediated pathway is a regulator of islet damage and should be a target for 
intervention to improve the efficacy of transplantation.
Introduction
Achieving long-lasting insulin independence after portal vein islet 
transplantation has improved, but remains challenging. Nonspe￾cific immune activation (1–6), along with preexisting and trans￾plant-induced auto- and allospecific immune responses (7–9), are 
components affecting outcome; these are not fully suppressed by 
ongoing protocols of generalized immunosuppression. Increasing 
general immunosuppression potency is not ideal because of side 
effects. Consequently, the development of novel protocols that spe￾cifically target proinflammatory immune cell compartments that 
impede islet function and survival is compelling.
Results and Discussion
The CXCL1-CXCR1/2 axis is a therapeutic target for improving pancre￾atic islet engraftment. CXCL1 was quantitatively the most relevant 
inflammatory factor released in culture by mouse islets, both in 
basal conditions and after IL-1β exposure (Supplemental Fig￾ure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI63089DS1). Accordingly, serum CXCL1 concen￾trations were increased 24 hours after islet infusion into the portal 
vein (Supplemental Figure 1B), and intrahepatic CXCL1 mRNA 
expression was strongly increased 4 hours after islet transplanta￾tion (>100-fold; Supplemental Figure 1C). CXCL1 signals through 
the chemokine receptor CXCR2 (10). To investigate the effects of 
activating the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis in islet engraftment, Cxcr2–/–
and Cxcr2+/+ alloxan-induced severely diabetic BALB-c mice were 
intrahepatically transplanted with Cxcr2+/+ syngeneic islets. The 
probability and median time to reach euglycemia were 62.5% and 
4 days, respectively, for Cxcr2+/+ recipients, compared with 100% 
and 1 day for Cxcr2–/– recipients (P = 0.03; Figure 1A). The geneti￾cally targeted mouse model has some limitations, which include a 
type 2 inflammatory tendency of the BALB-c mouse (11) and the 
possible redundancy caused by the binding of CXCL1 to the sec￾ond recently described murine receptor, CXCR1 (12). We therefore 
studied the effect of pharmacologic blockade of both CXCR1 and 
CXCR2 on syngeneic islet engraftment using the type 1 inflam￾matory-prone C57BL/6 mouse as a recipient. Recipient mice were 
treated with reparixin, a specific noncompetitive allosteric inhibi￾tor of CXCR1 and CXCR2 (13). Islet engraftment was improved in 
reparixin- versus vehicle-treated mice when either 150 islet equiva￾lents (IEQs; euglycemia probability, 84% vs. 50%; median time 
to euglycemia, 7 vs. 21 days; P = 0.04) or 250 IEQs (euglycemia 
probability, 100% vs. 57%; median time to glycemia, 1 vs. 50 days; 
P = 0.002) were used for transplant (Figure 1A).
CXCR1/2 inhibitor significantly reduces postinfusion recruitment of 
PMNs and NKT cells. Among intrahepatic leukocyte (IHL) popula￾tions, CXCR2 was expressed on all polymorphonuclear leukocytes 
(PMNs; Gr1+CD11b+Ly6C–; 97 ± 1%) and on a subpopulation of 
NKT cells (NK1.1+CD3+; 25 ± 6%) (Figure 1B). Both cell popula￾tions increased markedly in the livers of mice transplanted intra￾hepatically with syngeneic or allogeneic islets, and treatment of 
mice with the CXCR1/2 inhibitor significantly inhibited this rise 
(Figure 1C and Supplemental Table 1). Other IHL populations 
were only marginally affected by reparixin treatment (data not 
shown). The identification of a targetable pathway able to prevent 
the recruitment of both these cells is an important finding. PMNs 
are the predominant cell type infiltrating the islets in experimen￾tal models (14), and a vicious cycle mediated by NKT and PMN 
IFN-γ–based cross-talk was recently demonstrated to be harmful 
to transplanted islets (15). Concordantly, NKT cell inhibition or 
deletion improves engraftment and delays islet rejection (1, 2, 15).

Pharmacological blockade of CXCR1/2 improves islet transplantation 
outcome in humans. Chemokine and cytokine release was examined 
after 24 hours of culture of 44 human islet preparations (Figure 2). 
CXCL8, the human functional homolog of mouse CXCL1, was 
quantitatively the most relevant inflammatory factor released. 
Serum cytokine/chemokine concentrations were analyzed in 11 
patients with type 1 diabetes who received allogeneic islet trans￾plants under 2 immunosuppression regimens: ATG, FK506, and 
MMF (n = 3; NCT01220856), or ATG, RAPA, and MMF plus ste￾roid and IL-1 receptor antagonist (n = 8; NCT01346085). CXCL8 
significantly increased after islet infusion in both groups, which 
suggests that its release is not fully controlled by standard imuno￾suppression protocols that include antiinflammatory agents.
The findings in mouse and humans led to a phase 2 randomized, 
open-label pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of CXCR1/2 
inhibition after single-infusion islet transplantation. Inclusion cri￾teria restricted enrollment to patients expected to receive an islet 
mass in the lower range of the currently accepted transplantable 
islet amount. Patients were placed on an immunosuppression regi￾men consisting of induction with ATG and maintenance immu￾nosuppression with FK506 and MMF. Patients were randomly 
assigned to receive either no additional experimental intervention 
or CXCR1/2 inhibitor reparixin treatment (2.772 mg/kg BW/h i.v. 
continuous infusion for 7 days starting from day –1). Initially, 7 
consecutive patients were enrolled, with randomization to reparix￾in treatment in 4 patients (Pt2, Pt3, Pt5, and Pt7; see Supplemental 
Table 2 and Table 1 for islet and patient characteristics). No repar￾ixin-related adverse events were reported in these patients. None of 
the patients in the control group expressed β cell function 1 month 
after transplant (no decrease in insulin requirement coupled with 
C-peptide levels less than 0.09 ng/ml), and all were withdrawn as a 
result of graft loss. In contrast, patients treated with reparixin expe￾rienced improved transplant outcome, as measured by glycemic 
control, decreased insulin requirement, and appearance of detect￾able levels of C-peptide well above 0.3 ng/ml. Fasting C-peptide, 
reduction of insulin requirement, stimulated C-peptide (evaluated 
as peak and area under the curve response derived from the 2-hour 
mixed-meal tolerance test; ref. 16), and islet estimated function (17)

per time point. IHL populations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are mean ± SEM. For statistical comparisons, see Supplemental Table 1.

were all significantly higher in the reparixin group than in controls 
(Figure 3). Based on these results, the ethical review board recom￾mended protocol amendment allowing randomization to the 
reparixin treatment group only and to allow patients with a func￾tioning graft to receive a second islet infusion. 2 additional patients 
(Pt8 and Pt9) received islets with reparixin treatment. Pt8 demon￾strated excellent islet function (Figure 3), and Pt9 did not comply 
with oral immunosuppression treatment and dropped out of the 
study. The one reparixin-treated patient who did not have markedly 
improved transplant outcome, Pt7, had a 10-fold increase in GAD 
autoantibody titer soon after transplant. Pt2, Pt3, and Pt5 from 
the initial reparixin treatment group received a second islet infu￾sion, and Pt2 and Pt3 achieved insulin independence (total infused, 
7,589 and 8,888 IEQ/kg, respectively).
With the exception of selective CCR5 antagonists for HIV, our 
results represent the first clinical evidence to our knowledge 
that chemokine receptor blockade may have therapeutic benefit. 
Although the numbers in the trial were small, we demonstrated 
that an important cause of transplanted islet dysfunction in 
humans was nonspecific inflammation mediated by CXCR1/2 
receptor, which is inadequately inhibited by ongoing protocols of 
generalized immunosuppression. Collectively, the findings sug￾gest a novel approach to prevent early loss of transplanted islets. 
A phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-assign￾ment trial has commenced to confirm the results of this pilot 
study. We further suggest that targeting the CXCR1/2 pathway 
may be therapeutically relevant for the preservation of islet func￾tion in new-onset type 1 diabetes.
