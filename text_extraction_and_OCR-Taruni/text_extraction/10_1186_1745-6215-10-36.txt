Abstract
Background: Vitamin D does not only regulate calcium homeostasis but also plays an important role as an immune
modulator. It influences the immune system through the induction of immune shifts and regulatory cells resulting in
immunologic tolerance. As such, vitamin D is thought to exert beneficial effects within the transplant setting, especially
in kidney transplant recipients, considering the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in kidney transplant recipients.
Methods/Design: The VITA-D study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with two parallel groups
including a total of 200 kidney transplant recipients, is designed to investigate the immunomodulatory and renoprotective
effects of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) within the transplant setting. Kidney transplant recipients found to have vitamin D
deficiency defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 < 50 nmol per liter will be randomly assigned to receive either oral
cholecalciferol therapy or placebo and will be followed for one year. Cholecalciferol will be administered at a dose of
6800 International Units daily over a time period of one year.
The objective is to evaluate the influence of vitamin D3 substitution in vitamin D deficient kidney transplant recipients on
the post-transplant outcome. As a primary endpoint glomerular filtration rate calculated with the MDRD formula
(modification of diet in renal disease) one year after kidney transplantation will be evaluated. Incidence of acute rejection
episodes, and the number and severity of infections (analyzed by means of C-reactive protein) within the first year after
transplantation will be monitored as well. As a secondary endpoint the influence of vitamin D3 on bone mineral density
within the first year post-transplant will be assessed. Three DXA analyses will be performed, one within the first four
weeks post-transplant, one five months and one twelve months after kidney transplantation.

Background
Vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D is a steroid hormone important for the regula￾tion of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. There
are two ways of obtaining vitamin D, either from the diet
or by cutaneous production. Exposure of the skin to ultra￾violet light induces the conversion of 7-dehydrocholes￾terol to previtamin D3 which then spontaneously
isomerizes to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Two hydroxy￾lation steps in the metabolic activation of vitamin D3 are
necessary to convert it into its physiologically active form
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [calcitriol; 1,25(OH)2D3].
Vitamin D3 is first hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydrox￾yvitamin D3 [calcidiol, 25(OH)D3] and subsequently con￾verted to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by 1α-hydroxylase in
the kidney [1].
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 is considered the most reliable
indicator of vitamin D status as it reflects an individual's
dietary intake of vitamin D on the one hand and the
endogenous production in the skin on the other hand [2].
However, endogenous synthesis of vitamin D3 is more
important to achieve adequate body stores than dietary
intake due to the fact that vitamin D is found in a limited
variety of foods, mainly oily fish. Casual exposure to sun￾light supplies about 90% of the vitamin D requirement
for most people [3].
Especially, the elderly and chronically ill are at high risk to
develop vitamin D deficiency due to poor dietary vitamin
D intake on the one hand and their often modest outdoor
activities and the lack of exposure to sunlight on the other
hand [4,5]. Moreover, the capacity of human skin to pro￾duce vitamin D3 decreases in elderly subjects compared to
younger adults [3]. In a hospital setting, Thomas et al.
reported 57% of hospitalized patients to be vitamin D
deficient defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ≤ 37 nmol per
liter [4].
Accordingly, a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
was found in predialysis patients with moderate and
severe chronic kidney disease as well as in patients under￾going hemodialysis [6,7]. Analyses of pretransplant 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3 levels showed that only about 15% of
kidney transplant recipients have adequate vitamin D lev￾els at the time of transplantation [8,9]. After kidney trans￾plantation vitamin D deficiency remains a common
problem as kidney transplant recipients are advised to
avoid direct sun exposure because of the high risk of skin
cancer due to immunosuppressive therapy [10]. Consider￾ing the fact that also dietary calcium and vitamin D
intakes are often inadequate in kidney transplant recipi￾ents [11] they are at especially high risk to develop vita￾min D deficiency. Querings et al. analyzed serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3 levels in 31 kidney transplant recipi￾ents who all protected themselves from sun exposure
compared with an age- and gender-matched control
group at the end of winter. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
levels were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipi￾ents compared with controls, with 10 out of 31 having
undetectable serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels [12]. For
long term kidney transplant recipients Stavroulopoulos et
al. reported vitamin D insufficiency (40–75 nmol per
liter) to be present in 43%, deficiency (12–39 nmol per
liter) in 46% and severe deficiency (< 12 nmol per liter) in
5% [13].
Substitution of vitamin D deficiency
Considering the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
in kidney transplant recipients the investigation of vita￾min D substitution is of particular interest and relevance
to renal transplant patients.
Chronic kidney disease is accompanied by decreased pro￾duction of the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy￾vitamin D3, due to a reduction in renal parenchyma
leading to decreased 1α-hydroxylase available for convert￾ing 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Therefore, active vitamin D
supplements have effectively been used in order to main￾tain calcium homeostasis and to decrease the risk of
hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney dis￾ease.
However, it is still important to correct calcidiol defi￾ciency as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 serves as a substrate for
1α-hydroxylase not only in the kidney but also in several
extra renal tissues. For instance, there is evidence that
immune cells express 1α-hydroxylase and are therefore
able to synthesize active vitamin D locally. Thus, these tis￾sues are dependent on adequate 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
substrate for adequate local 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
production [14].
As such, vitamin D is thought to be a potent immune
modulator.
Immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D
Besides its classical actions in calcium homeostasis and
bone metabolism vitamin D plays an important role in
the immune system [15,16]. Due to its potential to mod￾ulate the immune response vitamin D is thought to have
beneficial effects within the transplant setting. Calcitriol
was shown to improve graft function and graft survival in
different models of transplantation and it is also assumed
to lead to less acute rejection episodes [17]. Data relating
infections to vitamin D status are sparse. There is some
evidence that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D3levels are associ￾ated with an increased risk of infections [18,19].

Trials 2009, 10:36 http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/10/1/36

Calcitriol acts as an inhibitor of the adaptive immune sys￾tem with T-lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells as
key targets [20]. On the one hand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 is able to shift the T-cell response towards a T-helper 2
phenotype which is considered to be protective in trans￾plantation [21] and on the other hand it induces dendritic
cells with tolerogenic properties resulting in T-cell hypore￾sponsiveness. This means that dendritic cells modulated
by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 are able to inhibit T-cell
proliferation and their cytokine production (e.g. Inter￾feron-γ), thus, inducing regulatory T-cells with suppres￾sive activity rather than effector T-cells [22,23]. These
effects are not limited to in vitro experiments, but could
also be demonstrated in models of allograft rejection
[24,25].
In clinical trials, a beneficial impact of calcitriol adminis￾tration in kidney transplant recipients on graft function,
overall graft survival and incidence of acute rejection epi￾sodes was demonstrated [26-29]. However, these studies
are retrospective studies that do not provide definitive evi￾dence of the assumed beneficial immunological effects. In
a small prospective study Ardalan et al. investigated the
effect of calcitriol started in the donor six days before
donation and continued in recipient side for six months
after transplantation. Expansion of CD4+ CD25+ regula￾tory T-cells was observed in the recipients [30] providing
strong evidence for the immunomodulatory properties of
active vitamin D in kidney transplant recipients.
Renoprotective properties of vitamin D
In several studies beneficial effects of active vitamin D on
progression of chronic kidney disease were documented,
either by interfering with the transforming growth factor
beta 1 (TGF-β1) signaling pathways or with the renin￾angiotensin-aldosterone system, both considered to be
important modulators of the progression of renal insuffi￾ciency [31,32].
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was shown to function as a
negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in ani￾mals [33]. Recently, Freundlich et al. demonstrated that
paricalcitol, a calcitriol analog, leads to a reduction in
mRNA levels and protein expression of angiotensinogen,
renin, and renin receptor in the 5/6 nephrectomized rat
model of kidney disease resulting in less glomerular and
tubulointerstitial damage, hypertension and proteinuria
[34].
In diverse rat models of kidney disease 1,25-dihydroxyvi￾tamin D3 was reported to attenuate the development of
glomerulosclerosis and progression of albuminuria
accompanied by a lower expression of TGF-β1 in the kid￾ney [35,36].
Furthermore, the podocyte was identified as an important
target for the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Calci￾triol reduces podocyte loss and changes of podocyte foot
process structure leading to a decreased albumin excretion
[37,38].
A recent clinical trial indicated that paricalcitol reduces
proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease. Agar￾wal et al. analyzed the effect of paricalcitol on proteinuria
in 195 chronic kidney disease patients stage 3 and 4 com￾pared to placebo. After six months 51% of the paricalcitol
treated subjects compared to 25% of the placebo treated
subjects were found to have a reduction in proteinuria
independent from the use of inhibitors of the renin-angi￾otensin-aldosterone system [39].
TGF-β1 is furthermore considered to play an important
role in the development of chronic allograft nephropathy.
Chronic allograft nephropathy is characterized by intersti￾tial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis and frequently leads
to late allograft loss in kidney transplantation [40]. There
is evidence that calcitriol interferes with TGF-β1 mediated
gene and protein expression and therefore influences the
effects of TGF-β1 in chronic allograft nephropathy [41].
Hullett et al. investigated the efficacy of active vitamin D
as monotherapy to prolong allograft survival and preserve
renal function in a rat model of chronic allograft nephrop￾athy. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 not only was reported to
prolong graft survival but also to prevent histological
changes typically found in chronic allograft nephropathy
by altering TGF-β1 and matrix regulating molecules [42].
In clinical studies, patients with chronic allograft neph￾ropathy were significantly linked with persistently higher
plasma TGF-β1 levels [43].
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 obviously has an impact on
innate and adaptive immunity, both responsible for acute
rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy which is
often observed to start only a few months after kidney
transplantation.
Methods
Objectives
The proposed study is designed to evaluate whether chole￾calciferol substitution in vitamin D deficient kidney trans￾plant recipients has beneficial effects upon the post￾transplant outcome compared to placebo. As a primary
outcome we will evaluate the impact of cholecalciferol on
- graft function (analyzed using glomerular filtration rate
calculated with the MDRD formula as well as albuminu￾ria) one year after kidney transplantation
- the incidence of acute rejection episodes within the first
year after kidney transplantation, and

(page number not for citation purposes)
- the frequency and severity (analyzed by means of C-reac￾tive protein levels) of infections within the first year after
kidney transplantation.
As a secondary objective we will assess whether cholecal￾ciferol substitution influences the common decline of
bone mineral density within the first year after kidney
transplantation [44] analyzed by means of absolute bone
mineral density (g/cm2).
Moreover, courses of calcium levels will be observed in
order to assess the safety of cholecalciferol administration
at 6800 International Units (IU).
Study design and setting
The VITA-D study is a single-center, randomized, placebo￾controlled parallel group study with blinding of patients,
study staff, and outcome assessors. Patient recruitment,
kidney transplants, postoperative care, and follow-up are
conducted at the Medical University of Vienna. The study
is planned to start in January 2009. There are about 150
kidney transplants performed annually at the Medical
University of Vienna. Approximately 30% of all kidney
transplant recipients are expected to be vitamin D defi￾cient defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 < 50 nmol per
liter. In case there are less than 60 subjects included in the
trial after one year it is intended to recruit two other trans￾plant centers.
Study population and sample size
The study sample will consist of 200 kidney transplant
recipients found to be vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvi￾tamin D3 < 50 nmol per liter) with 100 subjects in each
study group. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed
in the Appendix. The recruitment phase will last approxi￾mately four years with a follow-up period of one year for
each subject. A flowchart of the VITA-D study is shown in
Figure 1. The sample size calculation was performed
according to the following assumptions: Based on the
Vienna General Hospital database we concluded that the
mean serum creatinine level one year after transplantation
is x1 = 1,9 mg per deciliter with sigma, the common stand￾ard deviation, estimated to be σ = 0.5. An expert panel
evaluated that a difference in serum creatinine levels of
0,2 mg per deciliter would represent a significant clinical
improvement for the patient. Assuming that α = 0.05 and
the power = 0.80 a sample size of 99 for each sample was
calculated.
Randomization and blinding
If all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met
and informed consent has been obtained kidney trans￾plant recipients will be included in the study and allo￾cated a randomization number according to a
randomization list. Thus, the participant will be randomly
allocated to one of the two treatment arms. The random
allocation sequence will be computer-generated using the
Randomizer for Clinical Trials 1.7.0 developed at the
Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documen￾tation, Medical University of Graz, Austria. Block rand￾omization will be used in order to prevent imbalanced
treatment group sizes. We will use blocks of six to which
the two treatment modalities will be randomly allocated
in the ratio 1:1. To ensure homogenous treatment groups
randomization is stratified by 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 lev￾els, with one sub-stratum of kidney transplant recipients
found to have 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels between 25
and 50 nmol per liter and another of kidney transplant
recipients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels below 25
nmol per liter.
Participants, investigators, and outcome assessors will be
blinded to the allocated treatment. Blinding will be
ensured by the use of investigational products that are
identical in packaging, labeling, appearance, smell, and
taste. Unblinding will only occur in case of emergency and
at the conclusion of the study. In most cases, however, dis￾continuing the treatment should be sufficient without the
need for unblinding. Access to the randomization list is
restricted to the pharmacist involved in the study and a
research assistant.
Study intervention
Kidney transplant recipients found to have 25-hydroxyvi￾tamin D3 levels below 50 nmol per liter and who fulfill all
of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be
randomized to receive either oral cholecalciferol therapy
(Oleovit® D3-drops) or a placebo solution. Treatment
starts on day five after kidney transplantation. Cholecal￾ciferol will be administered at a dose of 6800 IU daily over
a time period of one year.
The only adverse drug reaction caused by vitamin D3 that
may occur is the rise in blood levels of calcium. In case of
hypercalcemia the dose can be reduced immediately as
serum calcium levels are monitored routinely at close
intervals (daily within the postoperative hospitalization,
i.e. between two and four weeks on average, thereafter
weekly until the fourth month after transplantation, and
subsequently every two to four weeks depending on post￾transplant complications). At serum calcium levels > 2,65
mmol per liter vitamin D3 administration will be reduced
to 3600 IU per day. If calcium levels persist above 2,85
mmol per liter over a period of four weeks vitamin D3
administration will be discontinued and restarted when
serum calcium levels declined to ≤ 2,65 mmol per liter
with only 3600 International Units per day. If calcium lev￾els remain high this may be attributed to a persistent or
transient hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism as
transient hypercalcemia is observed in 20–50% in kidney

transplant recipients. Thus, the subject will be tested with
ultrasound and 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI)
scan. However, these subjects will not be excluded from
the study.
Concomitant medication
Prior to kidney transplantation the administration of all
active vitamin D supplements which are prescribed to
almost all patients on dialysis will be discontinued.
Most kidney transplant recipients are administered a tri￾ple immunosuppressive therapy consisting of either myc￾ophenolatmofetil or mycophenolat-natrium, tacrolimus,
and prednisone. Steroid boli, monoclonal, and polyclo￾nal antibodies are administered to treat acute rejection
episodes.
Study procedures
Day 0
Prior to transplantation patients will be recruited from the
acute dialysis ward. There, and previous to kidney trans￾plantation, blood samples will be taken of all kidney
transplant candidates as a matter of routine, including a
blood sample for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 analyses.
Day 1–5
If a kidney transplant recipient is found to have 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3 levels below 50 nmol per liter infor￾mation about the VITA-D study, its purpose, putative ben￾efits, and possible risks will be given to the patient and he/
she will be invited to participate in the trial. All subjects
will be informed that the participation in the trial is vol￾untary and that the subject may refuse to participate or
withdraw from the trial at any time without giving rea￾sons, without loss of benefits. Kidney transplant recipi￾ents who do not agree to participate in the study will
receive standard care.
Demographic and baseline data will be collected of all
participants within the first five days after transplantation
(gender, age, body mass index, cause of end stage renal
disease, mode of renal replacement therapy, duration on
dialysis).
Day 5
Kidney transplant recipients who agreed to participate in
the study will be randomized to receive either oral vitamin
D3 therapy or placebo.
Treatment in hospital
Kidney transplant recipients are treated in hospital
between two and four weeks on average. Within this time
period blood samples are taken daily as a matter of rou￾tine, including analyses of serum creatinine, C-reactive
protein levels and calcium levels.
The first DXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) analysis
will be performed within the first four weeks after trans￾plantation depending on postoperative complications.
However, we aim at performing it within the first two
weeks.
Outpatient treatment
After discharge kidney transplant recipients are seen once
a week within the first four months after transplantation
and are thereafter scheduled for visits every two to four
weeks within the first year after transplantation. Blood
samples are taken at every visit at the nephrological out￾patient department.
Week 16
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels will be analyzed in order to
check the response to treatment. In addition, eating habits
and lifestyle (sun exposure, outdoor activities, and cloth￾ing) will be evaluated by means of a questionnaire.
After 5 months
The second DXA analysis will be performed.
After 12 months
The third DXA analysis will be performed.
A summary of all study procedures is shown in Figure 2.

Statistical analysis
Baseline data will be expressed as mean values ± standard
deviation for symmetrically distributed continuous varia￾bles, as median and 25th and 75th percentiles for asym￾metrically distributed continuous variables, and as
absolute and relative frequency for categorical variables.
Serum creatinine values after one year (the primary end￾point) will be compared between the groups by analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA), taking into account as covari￾ates creatinine value at randomization, 25-hydroxyvita￾min D3 at baseline, and variables which, despite
randomization, exhibit large group differences at base￾line. ANCOVA will also be applied to the area under the
curve of repeated measurements on serum creatinine,
CRP, and bone mineral density during the first year of fol￾low-up, using the same set of covariates. Categorical vari￾ables (number of acute rejection episodes and infections
within the first year after transplantation) will be analyzed
using χ2-test or fisher's exact test, as appropriate.
All analyses will be performed using an "efficacy subset
analysis". Patients are included in this analysis if the study
medication has been administered for more than seven
days.
Moreover, courses of calcium levels will be described. Fur￾thermore, the Bonferroni-Holm correction will be per￾formed to preserve the global significance level of 5%.
Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS.
Interims analysis
An interims analysis will be performed after 6 months of
follow-up for every subject. Within this analysis glomeru￾lar filtration rates between the two groups six months after
transplantation and the incidence of acute rejection epi￾sodes within six months after transplantation will be ana￾lyzed. In case the interims analysis shows a significant
difference between the two groups the study will be dis￾continued prematurely. The strict significance level of
0.001 for interim analysis requires no modification of the
significance level for the main analysis [45]. The interims
analysis will not break blinding.
Approval of the ethics committee and the regulatory 
authority
The proposed study will be conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki, the Austrian law and sub￾scribes to the principles outlined in the International
Conference on Harmonization on Good Clinical Practice,
2002. Approvals were obtained by the Ethics Committee
of the Medical University of Vienna and the Vienna Gen￾eral Hospital (Reference Number 213/2008) and the Aus￾trian regulatory authority (Federal Office for Safety in
Health Care, Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety).
Furthermore, the study has been registered in a public
clinical trial database (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00752401).
Discussion
Risk analysis
Considering current clinical trial data [46-48] the admin￾istration of vitamin D3 at a dose of 6800 IU per day is not
expected to pose any risks of severe adverse health effects.
Vitamin D intoxication is extremely rare and can only be
caused by intake of excessively high doses. Doses of more
than 50 000 IU per day can raise 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
levels to more than 370 nmol per liter and are associated
with hypercalcemia and hyperphosphataemia [46]. How￾ever, a threshold for vitamin D toxicity has not been estab￾lished yet. The tolerable upper intake level for vitamin D,
which is the formal limit for safe intake of vitamin D and
defined as "the amount of vitamin D that can be con￾sumed by adults on a long-term basis with no anticipation
of harm" [47] is set at 2000 IU per day. However, scientific
evidence demonstrates that vitamin D is not toxic at
intakes much higher than formerly considered unsafe.
Based on clinical trial evidence that shows that prolonged
intake of 10 000 IU per day of vitamin D3 is likely to pose
no risk of adverse effects, the recommended upper intake
level is set at 10 000 IU per day [48]. Moreover, there is no
scientific evidence that the margin of safety for vitamin D3
is less for patients with renal disease than for the rest of
the population [47].
Conclusion
To date, clinical trials investigating vitamin D and its
immunomodulatory properties within the transplant set￾ting have been sparse, only a few small trials are available.
We report the rationale, design, and methodology of the
VITA-D study, the first prospective, randomized, placebo￾controlled trial focusing on the immunomodulatory and
renoprotective properties of vitamin D3 in kidney trans￾plant recipients showing vitamin D deficiency. We will
investigate whether or not vitamin D3 has beneficial
effects upon graft function, the incidence of acute rejec￾tion episodes, and frequency and severity of post-trans￾plant infections. If vitamin D3 substitution proves to have
no relevant disadvantages and if effectiveness can be dem￾onstrated then clinical practice and routine supplementa￾tion of vitamin D3 in vitamin D deficient kidney
transplant recipients may be intensified.
