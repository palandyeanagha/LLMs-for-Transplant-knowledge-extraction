Abstract
Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare disease of childhood,


which carries a poor prognosis. Patients often present with severe
exercise limitation, and untreated life expectancy is less than 1
year. Pharmacological intervention is directed towards reduction of
the raised pulmonary artery pressure with vasodilator treatment,
initially with calcium antagonists, although more recently long term
prostacyclin treatment has shown benefit in some patients. Heart–
lung transplantation remains an option for children with severe
disease refractory to therapeutic treatment.  A 4 year old
Bangladeshi girl with dyspnoea, cyanosis, and signs of a low cardiac
output, is described. Initial treatment with prostacyclin was
gradually reduced, and maintenance treatment with oral sildenafil
(Viagra; Pfizer) instituted. At follow up 3 months later, her exercise
capacity was greatly improved and she continues to enjoy a good
quality of life without obvious side effects. In view of the
encouraging initial results, this may become an acceptable adjunct
in treating this patient group.
