Abstract
HCV is a major etiological agent of liver disease with a high rate of chronic evolution. The virus possesses 6 genotypes with
many subtypes. The rate of spontaneous clearance among HCV infected individuals denotes a genetic determinant factor.
The current study was designed in order to estimate the rate of HCV infection and ratio of virus clearance among a group of
infected patients in Saudi Arabia from 2008 to 2011. It was additionally designed to determine the genotypes of the HCV in
persistently infected patients. HCV seroprevalence was conducted on a total of 15,323 individuals. Seropositive individuals
were tested by Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HCV assay to determine the ratio of persistently infected patients to those
who showed spontaneous viral clearance. HCV genotyping on random samples from persistently infected patients were
conducted based on the differences in the 59untranslated region (59UTR). Anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 7.3% of the
totally examined sera. A high percentage of the HCV infected individuals experienced virus clearance (48.4%). HCV
genotyping revealed the presence of genotypes 1 and 4, the latter represented 97.6% of the tested strains. Evidences of the
widespread of the HCV genotype 4 and a high rate of HCV virus clearance were found in Saudi Arabia.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to be a major etiological
agent of liver disease throughout the world. HCV infection is the
most serious blood borne infection in the Middle East. The virus is
primarily transmitted in surgical operations such as organ
transplantations, blood transfusions or by injection using contam￾inated syringes. HCV is a RNA virus related to the genus
Hepacivirus, Family Flaviviridae and is characterized by a high
spontaneous mutation rate [1], [2]. HCV has been classified into
six major genotypes [2] and dozens of subtypes [3]. Genotypes 1,
2, and 3 are common throughout North America and Europe.
Genotype 4 (HCV-4) is common in the Middle East and in Africa,
where it is responsible for more than 80% of HCV infections [4].
In Saudi Arabia, HCV-4 was the most prevalent genotype
followed by HCV-1 whereas genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6 were rarely
reported [5], [6], [7], [8].
In general, HCV infection usually results in viral persistence [9],
and up to 30% of persistently infected patients develop chronic liver
disease [10]. This poses a high risk of infection to individuals who
receive organs, blood or blood products from HCV-infected donors
[11], [12], [13]. Chronic HCV infection may lead to serious
sequelae, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
[14], [15]. A strong host immune response enhances HCV
clearance [16], [17]. Thus, variation in genes involved in the
immune response may contribute to the ability to clear the virus. In
a recent genome based study, a single nucleotide polymorphism
(rs12979860) 23 kilobases upstream of the IL28B gene, which
encodes the type III interferon IFN-l3- was shown to be associated
strongly with more than a twofold difference in response to HCV
drug treatment [18]. Interestingly, this mutation was found in a high
rate of the population from Arabian Gulf Countries [19].
The current study was designed to: estimate the seroprevalence of
HCV exposure among Saudi populations, determine the HCV
genotypes in a representative sample of persistently infected patients
and estimate the rate of virus clearance among the HCV exposed
individuals.
Results and Discussion
The HCV seroprevalence was conducted on 15,323 Saudi
nationals. The overall anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 7.3%
(1124/15323) of the examined individuals (Figure 1a). The HCV
seropositive percentages over 4 years were ranged from (6.9–9.0%)
in males and (5.3–8.5%) in females where non-significant
variations were found between female and male seropositive
percentages using t test, (P = 0.1806) (Table 1).
This finding was higher than those recorded in other previous
studies in Saudi Arabia [20], [21]. Between 1992 and 2002,
63,368 blood donors were screened for anti-HCV antibodies and
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e29781

0.58% were found positive [20]. In another study, a higher ratio
was reported 21.7% (9/528)- and the differences in the exposure
rate due to ethnic origin was recorded where the anti-HCV in
non-Bedouin Saudis (living in urban areas) was greater than that in
Bedouin Saudis: 4.2% (7/165) and 0.5% (2/363) respectively [21].
On the other hand, Saudi patients subjected to hemodialysis
showed a very high rate of HCV infection (up to 50%) with a
further increase in the rate of infection among patients with end￾stage renal disease [7]. In the present study, HCV prevalence of
anti-HCV antibodies in males (55.9%) was found to be higher
than the prevalence in females (44.1%) (Figure 1b).
HCV among acutely infected persons showed a 14–40%
spontaneous recovery rate and clear viremia shortly following
seroconversion while the rest of the HCV exposed individuals
developed persistent infection [22], [23], [24], [25]. Chronically
infected individuals possess sustained viremia usually develop
persistent HCV infection. They can expect a worsening of their
liver disease, potentially culminating in cirrhosis or hepatocellular
carcinoma. In the current study, HCV seropositive individuals
were subjected to screening for HCV RNA viral load using a
Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HCV assay that possesses a
lower detection limit of 12 IU/ml. This assay is used for both
donors and patients and has been found to be a very effective way
for screening for HCV infection [26]. In some patients, the HCV￾RNA level fluctuates and accordingly, HCV-RNA is undetectable.
Regular follow-up of HCV-RNA is recommended at 6–12 months
intervals after clearance to confirm HCV negative status [27].
Patients in the current study who became HCV-RNA negative
were often re-tested 3–4 times in 12 months to confirm their
clearance of the infection as recommended by Harris et al. [27].
Patients experiencing persistent HCV infection were found to
comprise 51.6% (580/1124) of the total HCV exposed individuals
while 48.4% (544/1124) of the HCV exposed infection cleared the
infection (Table 2). There was no explanation why the infection
persists in some patients and resolves spontaneously without
intervention in others. Recently, host genetic variation was found
to explain the heterogeneity in HCV clearance and an association
between the virus clearance and the presence of a single nucleotide
polymorphism (rs12979860) 23 kilobases upstream of the IL28B
gene- does exist [18], [19]. The patients in that study, who showed
C/C genotype, were three times more likely to clear HCV relative
to those who possessed C/T and T/T genotypes [19]. The allele
frequencies showed that the pattern in which the allele leading to a
greater natural HCV clearance is nearly fixed throughout East
Asia and also in individuals from some Arabian Gulf countries
[19].Variations in genes involved in the immune response may
also contribute to the ability of patients to clear the virus [19].
Conflicting results regarding the gender effect of the HCV virus
clearance were recorded [28], [29]. In the current study, non￾significant (P = 0.4714) differences between the ability of infected
male and female patients to clear the virus (Table 2) were found.

This finding agrees with those of Inoue et al. [28] but disagrees
with those of Bakr et al. [29]. It is possible that interleukin 10
promoter polymorphisms (associated with rate of IL-10 produc￾tion) can account for any gender disparity in HCV clearance [30].
While most commercially available HCV typing assays target
the 59UTR since this region is the most highly conserved and
targeted for amplification methods, it has a limited subtyping
accuracy [31]. Although the preferred region for subtyping is the
NS5B gene, it is not always possible to amplify this region because
of primer-target mismatch. Failure in sequencing the NS5B gene
has been reported by some investigators despite successive
attempts to amplify cDNA with the NS5B primers [32]. It is
worthwhile mentioning that all 83 samples analyzed were
successfully amplified and sequenced in this study using 59UTR.
Genotype 4, followed by genotypes1a and 1b, were found to be
the most common genotypes in Saudi patients, whereas genotypes
2, 3, 5 and 6 were rarely found [5], [6], [7], [8]. In the current
study, 81/83 strains were found to be classified as genotype 4 while
only 2/83 strains were classified as genotype 1 (Figure 2). The
genotype 1 strains detected in the current study possessed guanine
(G) residue at position 299 (Figure 3) while 1a strains possessed
adenine (A) at that residue [33], [34]. Phylogenetic analysis of the
59UTR showed that Saudi strains (TAIF.SA9, TAIF.SA10) were
identical and showed high homology to three 1b strains from
Japan (AB049090, D30613 and AF207774) (Figure 2).
Among the genotype 4 strains in this study (n:81), different
variants (TAIF.SA1-8) were found. The nucleotide sequence of
one variant (TAIF.SA1) was found dominant in 75/81 of the
examined strains (data not shown). This sequence was detected in
both males and females with an age range of 14–70 years. This
variant (TAIF.SA1), showed high homology to isolates: Eg3
(Accession No. DQ988074), RG309 (Accession No.DQ284960)
and QC27 (Accession No. HCU33432) from Egypt, India and
Canada, respectively. The remaining variants (TAIF.SA2-8)
showed minor nucleotide variations. TAIF.SA3 and TAIF.SA7
were found closely related to TAIF.SA1. TAIF.SA4 and
TAIF.SA6 were found to be identical and both showed high
homology to TAIF.SA5 and to isolates: T63-UTR (Accession
No. AB550032), 6 (Accession No. DQ073340), MOR69 (Acces￾sion No. HQ833265) and 42179 from Egypt, India, Morocco and
UK, respectively. On the other hand, the TAIF.SA8 strain showed
less homology to other genotype 4 strains detected in the current
study but showed high nucleotide homology to isolates: cl111
(Accession No. DQ295833), QC306 (Accession No. EF115704),
14050 (Accession No. AY766521) and pt91 (Accession
No. AM502701) from, Egypt, Canada, UK and France, respec￾tively.
Therefore, current findings confirm the corrected prevalence of
HCV-4 in Saudi Arabia to be at least 97.6%, i.e. greater than the
previously reported prevalence observed among the Saudi
population. Further, it was found that most of Saudi patients
infected with a single subtype of HCV-4 however genetic
variability does exist. This suggests a recent circulation of a single
HCV-4 strain among Saudi patients.
Materials and Methods
Ethical approval
The project and data forms were approved by the Regional
Research and Ethics Committee at Armed Forces Hospitals, Taif,
Saudi Arabia. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants involved in our study.
Sample collection
Plasma samples were collected at Al-Hada Armed Forces
Hospital, Al-Taif, Saudi Arabia. A total of 15,323 samples were
collected (7911 males and 7412 females) from individuals between
the ages of 14 to 88 years during the period from May 2008 to
May 2011. Samples were aliquoted and stored at 220uC till used.
Serological assays screening for HCV
The ARCHITECT anti-HCV chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (version 3.0, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL)
was used for the qualitative detection of anti-HCV in plasma
samples (n: 15,323) according to the manufacture’s instruction.
The presence or absence of anti-HCV in the specimen was
determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the
reaction to the cutoff signal determined from a previous
ARCHITECT Anti-HCV calibration. If the chemiluminescent
signal in the specimen was greater than the cutoff signal, the
specimen was considered reactive for anti-HCV. The reproduc￾ibility of the assay was determined by using a modified form of the
EP5-A2 protocol of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute [35].
Measurements of HCV RNA
HCV-RNA was screened in seropositive samples by using
COBAS Amplicor HCV 2.0 qualitative assay and the COBAS
TaqMan HCV assay (Roche Diagnostics). In the COBAS
Amplicor HCV 2.0 assay, the viral genome was extracted with
the HCV Specimen Preparation Kit as described [36]. In the
COBAS TaqMan HCV assay, the viral RNA was extracted by the
automated COBAS AmpliPrep instruments and HCV RNA was
amplified and detected with the COBAS TaqMan Analyzer [37].
HCV genotyping
Randomly selected representative samples from HCV persis￾tently infected patients (positive anti-HCV antibodies/positive
HCV-RNA) were included in the study. Plasma samples from
Table 2. Percentage of HCV clearance among HCV infected population and comparison between percentage of clearance
between male and females infected patients.

HCV real time positive patients (n:83) were subjected to HCV
genotyping.
RNA purification and reverse transcription PCR
RNA was extracted from 300 ml of plasma with 900 ml of
TRIzol (Sigma), according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The
RNA pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of diethyl pyrocarbonate
treated water (Promega) and stored at 280uC. One-step RT-PCR
amplification for 59 Untranslated Region (UTR59) sequences was
performed using one step RT PCR (Qiagen) in a total 50-ml
reaction volume using 5 ml of the extracted RNA, 0.6 mM forward
59-GAAAGCGTCTAGCCATGGCGTTAGT-39 and reverse 59
-CTCGCAAGCACCCTATCAGG-39 oligonucleotides as de￾scribed [38]. Samples were incubated at 50uC for 30 min, and
95uC for 15 min. DNA amplification was performed for 35 cycles
each consisting of 94uC for 15 s, 50uC for 30 s, 72uC for 40 s. The
last cycle was followed by a 7 min. extension step at 72uC.
DNA purification and sequencing
Amplicons were purified and analyzed by ethidium bromide
agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples showing a band of the 241 bp
were excised from the gel and amplicon was purified using gel
extraction kit (Qiagen Inc) for further analysis by DNA sequencing
in both directions using the sense and antisense amplification
primers (Macrogen Inc., Korea). All sequence data used in this
study are available in the GenBank database (Accession No:
JN808433-JN808442).
Phylogenetic Analysis
BLAST analyses were initially performed to establish UTR59
sequence identities to GenBank accessions. Comparative analyses
were performed using the CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence
Alignment Program, Mega 4.1. HCV representative sequences
used for the alignments were obtained from the GenBank and
EMBL database. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by using
the neighbour-joining method with Kimura two-parameter
distances using MEGA version 4.1 [39]. The reliability of internal
branches was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replications and the p￾distance substitution model.
Statistical analysis
Both Fisher’s Exact Test and Chi square as well as t test were
used to analyze the results using Instat software.
