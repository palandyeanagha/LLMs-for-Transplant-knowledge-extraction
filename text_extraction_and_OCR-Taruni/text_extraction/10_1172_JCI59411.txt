Following organ transplantation, lifelong immunosuppressive therapy is required to preventthe hostimmune
system from destroying the allograft. This can cause severe side effects and increased recipient morbidity and
mortality. Complete cessation of immunosuppressive drugs has been successfully accomplished in selected
transplant recipients, providing proof of principle that operational allograft tolerance is attainable in clini￾cal transplantation. The intra-graft molecular pathways associated with successful drug withdrawal, however,
are not well defined. In this study, we analyzed sequential blood and liver tissue samples collected from liver
transplant recipients enrolled in a prospective multicenter immunosuppressive drug withdrawal clinical trial.
Before initiation of drug withdrawal, operationally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients differed in the intra￾graft expression of genes involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Furthermore, as compared with non￾tolerant recipients, operationally tolerant patients exhibited higher serum levels of hepcidin and ferritin and
increased hepatocyte iron deposition. Finally, liver tissue gene expression measurements accurately predicted
the outcome ofimmunosuppressive withdrawal in an independent set of patients. These results pointto a criti￾cal role for iron metabolism in the regulation ofintra-graft alloimmune responses in humans and provide a set
of biomarkers to conduct drug-weaning trials in liver transplantation.
Introduction
In human solid organ transplantation, long-term graft survival 
requires the administration of lifelong immunosuppressive ther￾apy. This may result in severe side effects and increased recipient 
morbidity and mortality. Over the past two decades, studies pri￾marily conducted in rodents have revealed that certain immuno￾logic interventions induce transplantation tolerance, a state in 
which the allograft is specifically accepted without the need to 
administer chronic immunosuppression (1). Translation of these 
strategies into the clinic, however, has been remarkably difficult 
(1–3). On the other hand, human transplant recipients occasion￾ally develop spontaneous operational tolerance, a phenomenon 
defined by the maintenance of stable graft function in the absence 
of harmful immune responses in recipients receiving no immu￾nosuppressive therapy (4–9). In order to identify a putative signa￾ture of operational tolerance in blood, the immunologic charac￾teristics of kidney and liver operationally tolerant recipients have 
been recently investigated in cross-sectional case-control studies 
(6, 10–12). The mechanistic interpretation of these studies, how￾ever, has been hampered by their retrospective design and by the 
lack of molecular analyses simultaneously conducted on allograft 
tissues. To unambiguously define the molecular pathways asso￾ciated with human allograft operational tolerance, we collected 
sequential blood and liver tissue samples from liver recipients 
enrolled in a prospective multicenter immunosuppression with￾drawal clinical trial. We sought to define the blood and intra-graft 
molecular patterns discriminating between recipients who can 
successfully discontinue immunosuppressive therapy (operation￾ally tolerant) and those who reject when immunosuppressive drugs 
are discontinued (non-tolerant). Before the start of drug minimiza￾tion, an expansion of NK cells and related transcripts was noted in 
blood samples collected from operationally tolerant recipients. In 
contrast, liver tissue samples obtained from operationally tolerant 
and non-tolerant recipients differed in the expression of a set of 
genes involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Among them, 
the gene encoding for hepcidin, the master regulator of systemic 
iron metabolism, was significantly overexpressed in operationally 
tolerant grafts. Furthermore, hepcidin serum levels and markers of 
systemic iron availability were higher in operationally tolerant than 
in non-tolerant recipients. These differences were not influenced by 
clinical parameters, nor by the type of immunosuppressive drugs

administered, and in the case of liver tissue markers could accu￾rately predict the outcome of the immunosuppressive withdrawal 
protocol. Our results reveal what we believe to be a novel role of 
iron metabolism in regulating the capacity of allografts to protect 
themselves against the cytotoxic effects of alloimmune responses, 
and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of opera￾tional tolerance in human liver transplantation.
Results
Clinical characteristics of the study population. Of the 102 liver recipi￾ents included in the immunosuppressive drug withdrawal trial, 
75 recipients from whom cryopreserved liver tissue samples had 
been obtained before the initiation of drug minimization and were 
available for transcriptional analyses were enrolled in the current 
study (Figure 1). Thirty-three recipients successfully discontinued 
all immunosuppressive drugs (operationally tolerant), while 42 
rejected their allografts (non-tolerant). Clinical and demographic 
characteristics of enrolled patients before the initiation of drug 
minimization are summarized in Table 1. Operationally toler￾ant recipients had been transplanted for a longer period of time 
(P < 0.0001), were older (P < 0.0005), and were more likely to be 
receiving no calcineurin inhibitors (P < 0.014) than non-tolerant 
recipients. There were no other significant differences in clini￾cal parameters between operationally tolerant and non-tolerant 
recipients. Similarly, no differences in liver function and graft his￾topathologic characteristics were noted between the two groups of 
patients at enrollment (Supplemental Table 1; supplemental mate￾rial available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI59411DS1). 
Liver tissue specimens were collected before initiation of drug min￾imization in all patients, at the time of rejection in non-tolerant 
recipients, and 12 months after complete drug withdrawal in oper￾ationally tolerant patients. PBMC and serum samples were sequen￾tially collected in all patients (Supplemental Table 2 contains a list 
of all biological specimens collected from enrolled recipients).
Global intra-graft gene expression assessment of liver tissue samples. We 
conducted whole-genome transcriptional profiling experiments 
employing Illumina microarrays on pre-minimization liver sam￾ples collected from 20 operationally tolerant and 28 non-tolerant 
recipients and on rejecting samples obtained from 18 non-toler￾ant recipients (all from Hospital Clinic Barcelona). In addition, 
microarray experiments were also performed on liver tissue samples 
collected from the following control patient groups: (a) HCV-nega￾tive liver recipients under maintenance immunosuppression with 
normal liver function and normal liver graft histology 1 year after 
transplantation (n = 8); (b) liver transplant recipients under main￾tenance immunosuppression with chronic hepatitis due to recur￾rent HCV infection (n = 12); (c) immunosuppressed liver recipients 
undergoing mild acute cellular rejection during the first year after 
transplantation (n = 9); and (d) normal liver tissue from non-trans￾planted patients undergoing surgery for colorectal liver metasta￾Figure 1
Study outline. Stable liver transplant recipients with follow-up beyond 3 years after transplantation were enrolled in an immunosuppression 
withdrawal clinical trial. Drugs were gradually discontinued over a 6- to 9-month period, and patients were followed for an additional 12-month 
period. Protocol liver biopsies were obtained at study onset, at any time rejection was suspected, and at the end of the study in patients who did 
not reject. Patients who maintained stable graft function during the entire duration of the study and in whom no signs of rejection were noticed in 
protocol biopsies were considered operationally tolerant (TOL). Patients who underwent rejection at any time during the follow-up were labeled 
as non-tolerant (Non-TOL). Pre-weaning liver biopsy differential gene expression was assessed in a training set of TOL and Non-TOL recipients 
(all from Hospital Clinic Barcelona) employing whole-genome microarrays. A panel of selected genes was then analyzed by qPCR, followed by 
a search for predictive genetic classifiers. This was accomplished employing a random splitting strategy that incorporated an independent set of 
TOL and Non-TOL recipients (from University of Rome “Tor Vergata” and University Hospitals Leuven).

ses (n = 10). To visualize the main differences in global intra-graft 
transcriptional patterns between these groups of samples, we per￾formed a non-supervised correspondence analysis of the entire 
filtered probe list (Figure 2A). Marked differences in gene expres￾sion were noted between non-transplanted liver tissue samples and 
biopsy samples obtained from transplant recipients. Furthermore, 
among transplant recipients, HCV-associated expression patterns 
were easily discernible from those of rejecting grafts. In contrast, 
global gene expression patterns of samples collected from opera￾tionally tolerant and non-tolerant immunosuppressed liver trans￾plant recipients before the initiation of drug minimization closely 
resembled each other regardless of whether immunosuppression 
could eventually be successfully withdrawn or resulted in graft 
rejection. These two groups also clustered with the group of con￾trol biopsies harvested from liver recipients with normal histology 
1 year after transplantation. Thus, the overall differences in global 
gene expression among liver biopsies collected from transplant 
recipients closely paralleled the presence or absence of intra-graft 
inflammatory infiltrates (Supplemental Table 1), with fewer diver￾gences being detectable between liver samples devoid of noticeable 
inflammatory infiltrates (i.e., operationally tolerant, non-tolerant, 
control liver recipients with normal histology).
Before initiation of drug minimization, liver tissue samples from opera￾tionally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients differ in genes involved in the 
regulation of iron metabolism. To explore in more detail the differences 
in gene expression profiles between liver tissue samples from opera￾tionally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients obtained before the 
initiation of drug minimization, we then performed a pairwise com￾parison between these two groups of samples employing signifi￾cance analysis of microarrays (SAM) (ref. 13, Figure 2B, and Table 2). 
Given the marked impact of HCV infection on intra-graft expres￾sion patterns, the 3 samples from HCV-infected recipients were 
excluded from the analysis. Liver tissue samples from operation￾ally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients differed in 8 transcripts at 
a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0 and in 176 transcripts at FDR less 
than 25% (see the complete dataset at http://bioinfo.ciberehd.org/
asf2011/index.html). The genes with the most significant change 
in expression were HAMP and TFRC (FDR, 0; fold-change, 3.74 and 
–2.03, respectively), known to be critical for the regulation of iron 
homeostasis, and two ferritin-like pseudogenes, FTHL12 and FTHL8
(FDR, 0; fold-change, –1.41 and –1.43, respectively). Additional 
genes involved in iron metabolism among the set with FDR less 
than 25% were EPHX1, A2M, CP, FTHL3, FTHL11, ABAT, and SFXN4. 
The significance of iron-related genes was further confirmed by an 
unbiased functional analysis employing the Gene Ontology (GO) 
database. Iron ion homeostasis was the biological pathway most 
significantly overrepresented in the operational tolerance–associ￾ated expression profile (Table 3). Only a small number of genes 
associated with inflammation and immunopathogenesis (CD26, 
CD32, ADORA3, PTPN22) were differentially expressed between 
samples from operationally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients. 
In contrast, at the time of rejection non-tolerant recipients exhib￾ited marked overexpression of various immune-related genes (e.g., 
STAT1, IL32, CXCL9, CXCL10, CD83, CD8A), none of which were 
detectable in the same group of patients before the initiation of 
drug minimization (Supplemental Table 3). We selected samples 
from 9 operationally tolerant and 10 non-tolerant recipients to 
conduct a cross-platform validation on whole-genome Affymetrix 
microarrays. In agreement with the Illumina experiments, only a 
small set of genes was differentially expressed between operation￾ally tolerant and non-tolerant liver samples (Supplemental Figure 
1A). Furthermore, a strong correlation between the two platforms 
was noted, with HAMP and TFRC being among the 10 genes whose 
expression differed the most between samples from operationally 
tolerant and non-tolerant recipients in the Affymetrix experiments 
as well (Supplemental Figure 1B).
Microarray intra-graft gene expression differences can be validated 
by real-time quantitative PCR. To validate the most informative 
microarray targets and to further investigate the role of previ￾ously identified immune tolerance–related genes, we performed 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) expression measurements for a set of 
104 target genes on the same samples employed in the Illumina 
microarray experiments (Supplemental Table 4). Operationally 
tolerant and non-tolerant samples significantly differed in the 
expression of HAMP and TFRC. In addition, qPCR revealed dif￾ferences in the expression of HMOX1, MIF, IFNG, SOCS1, CDHR2, 
DAB2, SLC5A12, and PEBP1 (Supplemental Figure 3). The differ￾ences in gene expression could not be attributed to differences in 
clinical parameters between operationally tolerant and non-toler￾ant recipients, since the association between expression markers 
and operational tolerance remained significant in most cases after 
adjustment for recipient’s age, sex, time since transplantation, and 
immunosuppressive therapy (Supplemental Table 5).
Intra-graft transcriptional biomarkers measured before initiation of 
immunosuppressive drug minimization accurately predict the outcome 
of drug withdrawal independent of any clinical parameter. To deter￾Table 1

mine whether biopsy-based gene expression classifiers could be 
employed to predict the success of immunosuppression withdraw￾al, we undertook an exhaustive search for gene predictive models 
on the qPCR-derived expression dataset. To conduct this analysis, 
we employed the same set of samples previously hybridized on 
Illumina microarrays (all of them from Barcelona), together with 
an independent group of biopsies from 10 operationally tolerant 
and 11 non-tolerant recipients (from Rome and Leuven), none of 
which had been included in the microarray experiments. To build 
the most robust and stable gene classifiers, we chose a repeated 
random sampling cross-validation strategy. These analyses result￾ed in the identification of 5 gene expression signatures capable of 
predicting the outcome of the immunosuppression weaning pro￾tocol, with less than a 17.5% overall error rate and very high sen￾sitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative predictive value (NPV), and 
positive predictive value (PPV), regardless of the center in which 
recipients had been enrolled (Table 4). The predictive accuracy of 
the gene classifiers was also independent of recipient age, sex, time 
from transplantation, and type of baseline immunosuppression 
(Supplemental Table 6) and was more powerful than any combina￾tion of clinical parameters (data not shown).
In operationally tolerant recipients, intra-graft transcriptional measure￾ments are not influenced by the discontinuation of immunosuppressive 
therapy. To investigate the impact of immunosuppressive drug 
withdrawal on liver tissue–derived expression patterns, we com￾pared liver samples collected before initiation of drug minimiza￾tion and 12 months after complete drug discontinuation. This 
was performed employing Affymetrix microarrays in a group of 
5 operationally tolerant recipients. No major differences in gene 
expression were observed between the two time points, indicating 
that the presence or absence of pharmacological immunosup￾pression did not significantly alter the intra-graft gene expression 
profile of operationally tolerant recipients (only 6 probe sets were 
statistically significant with FDR <25%; Supplemental Figure 2).

Furthermore, the 5 gene expression signatures defined above clas￾sified “pre-weaning” and “12 months after drug discontinuation” 
liver tissue samples from operationally tolerant recipients with 
similar accuracy (79%–88% in “pre-weaning” samples as compared

Non-tolerant recipients exhibit decreased serum levels of hepcidin. 
HAMP-encoded hepcidin is the central regulatory molecule of 
systemic iron homeostasis (14). We investigated whether opera￾tionally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients differed in hepcidin 
serum levels both before the initiation of drug minimization and

or rejection. A correlation between intra-graft hepcidin expres￾sion and hepcidin serum levels was noted (Figure 3A). In keeping 
with the gene expression results, non-tolerant recipients exhibited 
lower serum hepcidin levels than operationally tolerant patients 
both at baseline and at the end of the study. Hepcidin serum lev￾els were also lower in non-tolerant recipients than in non-trans￾planted age- and sex-matched control individuals from the general 
population (Figure 3B). Furthermore, among transplant patients, 
undetectable hepcidin levels were only observed in non-tolerant 
recipients (<0.5 nM in 27.9% of non-tolerant individuals; Figure 
3B). Hepcidin serum levels correlated with serum ferritin, a marker 
of body iron stores. Accordingly, ferritin serum levels were signifi￾cantly higher in operationally tolerant than in non-tolerant recipi￾ents (Figure 3C), and absence of iron stores (serum ferritin <12

ng/ml, a highly specific indicator of iron deficiency; refs. 15–17) 
was exclusively observed among non-tolerant recipients (Figure 
3C). The relationship between ferritin and hepcidin, however, dif￾fered between groups (Figure 3D). Thus, in operationally toler￾ant recipients, the increase in serum hepcidin per unit of serum 
ferritin was lower than in non-tolerant recipients (P = 0.044) and 
control individuals (P = 0.005), while it was similar in non-tolerant 
and control individuals (P = 0.488). The association between either 
hepcidin or ferritin and tolerance was not confounded by recipi￾ent age, sex, time from transplantation, or baseline immunosup￾pressive therapy, as demonstrated by their independent predictive 
value in a logistic regression multivariable analysis (Supplemental 
Table 7). Finally, operationally tolerant and non-tolerant recipi￾ents did not differ in blood hemoglobin, soluble transferrin recep￾tor, serum iron, or C-reactive protein levels; transferrin saturation 
rate; incidence of ferropenic anemia; or HFE gene polymorphisms 
(Supplemental Table 8).
Before the initiation of drug minimization, liver grafts from operation￾ally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients contain similar numbers of 
intra-hepatic lymphocytes but differ in hepatocyte iron accumulation. We 
assessed intra-graft iron accumulation by employing Perls stain￾ing in HCV-negative recipients. Mild periportal hepatocyte iron 
deposition was noted in most grafts from operationally tolerant 
recipients. In contrast, this was found in only a minority of liver 
biopsy samples from non-tolerant recipients. These differences 
were exclusively due to hepatocyte, rather than mesenchymal 
(endothelial and Kupffer cell), iron accumulation (Figure 4A). The 
periportal hepatocellular distribution of iron deposits noted in 
operationally tolerant recipients resembled findings previously 
reported in a minority of male healthy individuals with normal 
liver function (18). We then explored the relationship between iron 
stores and the differentially expressed gene set by deriving gene 
influence plots (Figure 4B). HAMP, TFRC, MIF, CDHR2, HMOX1, 
SLC5A12, DAB2, and MCOLN1 were significantly associated with 
either intra-hepatic iron stores or serum ferritin levels. In con￾trast, other gene expression markers, such as IFNG, PEBP1, SOCS1, 
VNN3, ADORA3, and TTC3, showed no or marginal association 
with iron stores, suggesting the potential involvement in the 
maintenance of operational tolerance of pathways other than iron 
metabolism. Similar results were observed when gene expression 
measurements were correlated with serum ferritin levels (Figure 
4B). Immunofluorescence experiments were performed in parallel 
to investigate intra-graft effector and regulatory T cell subset infil￾tration. Lymphocyte infiltrates were very small in the portal tracts 
and almost absent in the lobules. Liver samples from operation￾ally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients exhibited similar num￾bers of CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+FOXP3+ T cell subpopulations and 
CD4+FOXP3+/T cell ratios (Figure 4, C and D, and Supplemental 
Table 9). Among FOXP3+ lymphocytes, 93.7% were CD4+ and only 
6.3% were potentially activated CD8+ cells. Thus, the immunophe￾notyping of liver biopsy samples did not distinguish operationally 
tolerant from non-tolerant patients.
The transcriptional profiles of liver tissue samples from operationally toler￾ant and non-tolerant recipients differ from those observed before the initia￾tion of drug minimization in PBMCs. Our group previously reported 
the results of a retrospective cross-sectional study in which we 
observed that drug-free operationally tolerant liver recipients and 
liver recipients requiring maintenance immunosuppression dif￾fered in PBMC expression patterns (19). In order to investigate the 
similarities between PBMC and liver tissue expression patterns, we 
extracted RNA samples from PBMCs collected before the initiation 
of drug minimization from 20 operationally tolerant and 25 non￾tolerant recipients (all of them from Hospital Clinic Barcelona) 
and performed gene expression experiments using both Affymetrix 
microarrays and qPCR (Supplemental Table 10). Microarray expres￾sion experiments conducted at baseline on PBMC samples revealed 
that the two groups of patients differed in the expression of 124 
genes (FDR <5%, fold change ±1.32; Figure 5A and Supplemental 
Table 11), with NK-related gene sets being significantly overrepre￾sented in the operational tolerance expression profile (Supplemen￾tal Table 12). None of these genes overlapped with the differen￾tially expressed data set derived from liver tissue samples. Of the 94 
targets tested by qPCR in the same set of PBMC samples, 11 were 
significantly different between operationally tolerant and non-tol￾erant recipients (Supplemental Table 13). Eight of these 11 genes 
(NCR1, KLRF1, IL2RB, GZMB, SH2D1B, CLIC3, KLRC4, NCAM1), 
all of them preferentially expressed by NK cells, had been previ￾ously described by our group as associated with liver operational

tolerance (19). In order to compare the predictive performance of 
liver tissue and PBMC-derived gene expression signatures in the 45 
recipients from whom baseline PBMC and liver tissue qPCR expres￾sion data were available, we computed receiver operating character￾istic (ROC) curves for the following three predictive signatures: (a) 
CDHR2, MIF, PEBP1, SOCS1, and TFRC (representative liver tissue–
based signature described in Table 4); (b) SLAMF7, KLRF1, CLIC3, 
PSMD14, ALG8, CX3CR1, and 
RGS3 (representative PBMC-based 
signature described in ref. 19); and 
(c) NCR1, PDGFRB, and PSMD14
(most performant PBMC-based 
logistic regression model derived 
from the set of 11 differentially 
expressed genes described above). 
The liver tissue–derived signature 
outperformed both the PBMC￾based model identified in our 
previous work and the new model 
derived from the samples included 
in the current study (Figure 5B).
We next employed qPCR to 
measure in the liver tissue sam￾ples collected before the initiation 
of drug minimization the expres￾sion levels of the most informa￾tive genes identified in PBMCs 
(IL2RB, KLRF1, SLAMF7, KLRD1, 
CX3CR1, LINGO2, BNC2, NCR1, 
COL13A1, IGFBP7, NCAM1, 
KLRK1, KLRC1). Again, none of 
the genes significantly associated 
with operational tolerance in the 
liver tissue experiments over￾lapped with the set of genes dif￾ferentially expressed in the PBMC 
samples (Supplemental Table 4).
Before the initiation of drug minimi￾zation, operationally tolerant recipi￾ents exhibit an expansion of NK cells 
in peripheral blood. Before the start 
of drug minimization, operation￾ally tolerant recipients exhibited 
an increased proportion of NK 
lymphocytes and a decreased 
proportion of Vδ2-TCR γδT cells 
as compared with non-tolerant 
patients. Furthermore, operation￾ally tolerant recipients displayed 
a higher proportion of circulat￾ing CD4+CD25+CD127–Foxp3+ T 
cells than non-tolerant recipients. 
This was, however, only detectable 
12 months after drug withdrawal 
or rejection and not at enrollment 
(Figure 5C).
Discussion
Liver cells are continually exposed 
to bacterial degradation products 
and food-derived antigens through the portal venous blood. This 
results in a microenvironment biased toward tolerance rather than 
immunity (20, 21) and likely contributes to the systemic liver tol￾erance effect observed in most animal models of liver transplan￾tation and in selected human recipients who require no immu￾nosuppressive drugs. The exact mechanisms (i.e., immunological 
tolerance, ignorance, immunodeficiency, or graft accommodation)

responsible for the successful discontinuation of immunosup￾pressive drugs in human liver transplant recipients are, however, 
unknown. Furthermore, there are currently no tools to detect 
operationally tolerant liver recipients prior to drug withdrawal. To 
identify predictive biomarkers and investigate the pathogenesis of 
operational tolerance, we conducted a comprehensive molecular 
analysis of blood and allograft tissue specimens collected from 
liver recipients before immunosuppressive therapy was discontin￾ued. Genetic classifiers were then derived and employed to pre￾dict the outcome of drug withdrawal. Liver tissue samples from 
operationally tolerant and non-tolerant patients differed in the 
expression of an unexpectedly small number of genes. Those with 
the most significantly different expression were genes involved in 
the regulation of iron homeostasis. These results were validated 
employing three different transcriptional platforms and further 
confirmed by the observation that intra-hepatic iron stores and 
hepcidin and ferritin serum levels were different in operationally 
tolerant and non-tolerant individuals. The association between 
iron metabolism markers and operational tolerance was not influ￾enced by recipient characteristics or immunosuppressive therapy 
and was stable over time. Furthermore, intra-graft gene expression 
measurements accurately predicted the outcome of immunosup￾pression withdrawal independent of any clinical parameter.
Iron participates in most cell functions and is essential for cell 
survival. Hepcidin, mainly secreted by hepatocytes, acts as the main 
regulator of systemic iron metabolism by triggering the degrada￾Figure 4

tion of ferroportin and thus preventing the export of dietary and 
macrophage iron into the circulation (14, 22). Hepcidin expres￾sion is inversely related to body iron requirements, being increased 
when iron stores are sufficient and decreased when iron require￾ments are high. Furthermore, hepcidin expression is enhanced by 
inflammation and inhibited by hypoxia and erythropoietic signals 
(22). In our study, the lower hepcidin transcript and protein levels 
observed in non-tolerant recipients correlated with lower serum 
ferritin levels and with upregulation of TFRC expression (com￾monly seen in situations of decreased hepatic iron stores), while 
no differences in other pathways potentially influencing hepcidin 
expression were detected. Indeed, according to serum ferritin levels, 
more than one-third of non-tolerant recipients exhibited a state of 
non-anemic iron deficiency. In contrast, in operationally tolerant 
recipients, both ferritin and hepcidin serum levels were similar 
to those in healthy individuals. Operationally tolerant recipients, 
however, exhibited a lower increase in serum hepcidin per unit of 
serum ferritin than both non-tolerant and control individuals. This 
finding, suggestive of an inappropriate response to iron stores, is 
the hallmark of most diseases of iron metabolism resulting in iron

overload. Consistently, as compared with non-tolerant recipients, 
operationally tolerant individuals displayed increased hepatocyte 
iron accumulation. Of note, these differences in liver iron loading 
were mild, clinically silent, and not associated with liver injury.
Changes in iron availability can influence microbial growth and 
affect the function of macrophages and other innate immune cells 
(23, 24). Furthermore, iron redistribution via modulation of hep￾cidin-ferroportin expression is a well-established antimicrobial 
strategy in mammals. This mechanism appears to have a major 
pathogenic role in liver infections by pathogens such as HCV and 
Plasmodium, where iron overload is associated with poor prognosis 
(25–29). Whether these effects are mainly due to pathogen growth 
inhibition, regulation of host immune responses, or both remains 
to be clarified. Similarly, the interactions among iron metabolism, 
adaptive immune responses, and allograft tolerance also need to 
be adequately investigated. In renal transplantation, several studies 
have linked post-transplant anemia with rejection and lower recipi￾ent and graft survival (30, 31). However, the prevalence and poten￾tial contribution of iron deficiency to these outcomes has not been 
systematically assessed. Similarly, the association between iron sta￾tus and immunological outcomes in clinical liver transplantation 
remains to be explored. In an experimental rodent model of endo￾toxin-mediated liver inflammation, iron deficiency and decreased 
hepcidin levels resulted in exacerbated inflammatory responses, 
and this phenomenon was attenuated by exogenous hepcidin 
administration (32). In a similar model, hepcidin was shown to 
exert its intrinsic antiinflammatory effect through the phosphory￾lation of Stat3 (33). While this could be relevant to liver transplan￾tation given the immunoregulatory function of Stat3 (34–37), the 
role of hepcidin and iron metabolism in models of immune-medi￾ated liver diseases has yet to be investigated. Ours is therefore the 
first report to our knowledge indicating that modulation of hepci￾din expression and redistribution of intra-graft iron stores could be 
involved in the capacity of the liver allograft to restrain alloreactive 
immune responses. Whether our findings constitute a cause or a 
consequence of the operationally tolerant state cannot be unam￾biguously established in the current study and will need to be for￾mally demonstrated in future trials analyzing sequentially collected 
liver biopsy samples and addressing the immunologic outcome of 
iron metabolism therapeutic manipulations.
Regulation of iron homeostasis is unlikely to be the sole mecha￾nism contributing to operational tolerance in liver recipients. 
Indeed, liver tissue samples from operationally tolerant and non￾tolerant recipients also differed in the expression of a limited num￾ber of genes with cytoprotective and immunoregulatory function 
(CD26, ADORA3, DAB2, MIF, HMOX1, SOCS1). These genes were 
coregulated in a consistently antiinflammatory mode. Thus, as 
compared with non-tolerant grafts, operationally tolerant samples 
exhibited increased transcript levels of immune-inhibitory DAB2
and HMOX1 and decreased levels of immune-activatory CD26
and MIF. CD26 and ADORA3 are involved in the metabolism of 
adenosine, an immunosuppressive mediator responsible in part 
for the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (38). In experi￾mental animal models, SOCS1 plays an important cytoprotective 
role by preventing harmful TLR-mediated cytokine responses and 
appears to be a critical negative regulator of LPS signaling follow￾ing LPS restimulation (the so-called LPS tolerance effect) (39, 40). 
Furthermore, operationally tolerant and non-tolerant grafts also 
differed in the expression of CD32 and PTPN22, genes whose vari￾ants are associated with multiple autoimmune disorders (41). In 
contrast, prototypical immunoregulatory molecules identified in 
experimental rodent models of allograft tolerance, such as FoxP3, 
PD1/PDL1, CTLA4, IDO, IL-10, and TGF-β (1, 42–45), were not 
found to be associated with operational tolerance in our prospec￾tive clinical trial. Similarly, no differences were noted in the liver 
tissue expression of proinflammatory cytokines (other than IFNG, 
which is also crucial for regulatory T cell function in vivo; ref. 46) 
in the number of intra-graft effector and/or regulatory lympho￾cyte subsets, in the expression of proinflammatory mediators in 
PBMCs, or in serum C-reactive protein levels.
Exploratory experiments conducted to identify blood immuno￾logic markers of successful drug withdrawal showed an associa￾tion between NK cells and related transcripts and operational tol￾erance. This is consistent with our observations made in previous 
cross-sectional retrospective studies (19). Our current demonstra￾tion that NK-related transcriptional markers can be detected in 
PBMCs before immunosuppressive drugs are withdrawn indicates 
that they constitute a true biomarker of operational tolerance in 
liver transplantation. The availability of noninvasive biomarkers 
of operational tolerance has major clinical implications. The pre￾dictive performance of PBMC-derived transcriptional signatures, 
however, was less satisfactory than originally described (6, 10–12) 
and lower than that of liver tissue–based expression markers. Fur￾thermore, clinical implementation of transcriptional tests requir￾ing Ficoll-isolated PBMCs can be challenging. Further clinical 
validation specifically assessing reproducibility and clinical appli￾cability will therefore be required before a blood-based in vitro 
diagnostic test of operational tolerance can be proposed.
Our findings suggest that the capacity of the liver allograft to 
resist immune-mediated injuries is likely to be a central mecha￾nism in the maintenance of operational tolerance. This is sup￾ported by the demonstration that liver allografts from operation￾ally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients differ in the expression 
of multiple genes potentially involved in the attenuation of intra￾graft inflammatory responses, and by the absence of significant 
differences between the two groups of recipients in blood and 
liver tissue markers of adaptive immunity. A definitive answer to 
this question, however, will require analysis of donor-specific allo￾immune responses and evaluation of the potential role of time, 
recipient age, and immunosenescence.
In short, we have identified several liver tissue–based prognostic 
expression models that can accurately identify operationally toler￾ant recipients before immunosuppressive drugs are discontinued. 
This could allow for the routine implementation of immunosup￾pression weaning strategies in liver transplantation. Furthermore, 
we have shown for the first time to our knowledge that graft 
acceptance in the absence of immunosuppression is strongly asso￾ciated with the state of iron homeostasis. Our results suggest that 
in clinical transplantation, in which complete ablation of allo￾specific immune responses can rarely be accomplished, graft-spe￾cific mechanisms potentially capable of preventing inflammatory 
tissue destruction (such as the iron-hepcidin, adenosinergic, and 
SOCS1 immunomodulatory pathways, among others) are critical 
for the maintenance of operational tolerance. These mechanisms 
may be redundant for the prevention of graft rejection when non￾specific immunosuppressive drugs are administered but become 
essential as soon as immunosuppressive drugs are withdrawn. 
Our findings raise the prospect for therapeutic manipulations 
that could result in the widespread establishment of operational 
tolerance in liver transplantation.

Methods
Patient population and study design. One hundred and two stable liver recipi￾ents at least 3 years after transplantation were enrolled in a prospective 
multicenter trial of immunosuppressive drug withdrawal (ClinicalTrials.
gov NCT00647283). Immunosuppressive drug doses were gradually 
decreased until complete discontinuation over 6–9 months. Patients were 
then followed up for 12 additional months. Protocol liver biopsy samples 
were obtained in all patients at baseline, 12 months after successful drug 
withdrawal (in operationally tolerant recipients), and at the time of rejec￾tion (in non-tolerant recipients). Patients who did not develop rejection 
were classified as operationally tolerant as long as immunosuppressive 
drug cessation was maintained for at least 12 months and no histopatho￾logic evidence of acute and/or chronic rejection were observed. Rejection 
was diagnosed by the combination of allograft dysfunction and charac￾teristic liver biopsy findings according to Banff criteria (47). Of the 102 
recipients participating in the trial, 75 from whom baseline liver samples 
had been cryopreserved were included in the current study. Recipients were 
enrolled from Hospital Clinic Barcelona, University of Rome “Tor Vergata,” 
and University Hospitals Leuven. A description of the patient population 
and clinical outcome of the immunosuppression withdrawal clinical trial 
is provided in Supplemental Figure 4.
Liver biopsy specimens. Liver biopsies were performed percutaneously 
under local anesthesia. A 2- to 3-mm portion of the needle biopsy liver cyl￾inder was immediately preserved in RNAlater reagent (Ambion), kept at 
4°C for 24 hours, and then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen after removal 
of the RNAlater reagent. The remaining cylinder was formalin fixed and 
paraffin embedded (FFPE). In non-transplanted control patients, surgi￾cal liver biopsy samples of non-tumoral livers were obtained and pro￾cessed as previously described.
Histological assessment of liver biopsies. For histological assessment, 3-μm￾thick slides were stained using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome 
for connective tissue analysis, and Perls staining for iron content. For the 
current study, all histological examinations were performed by the same 
pathologist, who was blinded to all clinical and biological data. Iron con￾tent was assessed employing the total iron scoring system described by 
Deugnier et al. (48). This scoring system (range, 0–60) takes into consid￾eration iron deposition into three compartments: hepatocytic, sinusoidal, 
and portal. Although it is a semiquantitative score, this method has been 
previously validated and shows a good correlation to the biochemical 
quantification of hepatic iron content.
Liver tissue RNA extraction and processing. For total RNA extraction, cryopre￾served liver tissue samples were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) 
using a pestle and nuclease-free 1.5-ml reaction tubes (Ambion). Total RNA 
was then extracted following the manufacturers guidelines, and quality was 
assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The same 
procedure was employed to extract RNA from Ficoll-isolated PBMCs.
Liver tissue microarray experiments. One hundred and six liver tissue 
RNA samples (from 20 operationally tolerant and 26 non-tolerant recip￾ients, 18 non-tolerant recipients at the time of rejection, 3 operationally 
tolerant recipients at the end of the study, 12 recipients with recurrent 
HCV infection (HEPC), 9 recipients with acute cellular rejection (Rej), 
8 recipients under maintenance immunosuppression with normal liver 
histology (Ctrl-Tx), and 10 non-transplanted patients undergoing liver 
resection (Ctrl); all of them from Hospital Clinic Barcelona) were pro￾cessed into cRNA and hybridized onto Illumina HumanHT-12 Expres￾sion BeadChips containing 48,771 probes corresponding to 25,000 
annotated genes. In a selected group of 9 operationally tolerant and 10 
non-tolerant recipients from the training set, microarray experiments 
were replicated onto Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays 
covering 47,000 annotated genes by 54,675 probes. In 5 of the 9 opera￾tionally tolerant recipients, additional Affymetrix experiments were con￾ducted employing RNA extracted from liver biopsy samples obtained 12 
months after drug withdrawal.
Liver tissue microarray gene expression data analysis. For Illumina micro￾arrays, expression data were computed using BeadStudio data analysis 
software (Illumina) and subsequently processed employing quantile 
normalization using the Lumi bioconductor package (49). Next, we con￾ducted a conservative probe-filtering step excluding those probes with 
a coefficient of variation of 5%, which resulted in the selection of a total 
of 33,062 probes from the original set of 48,771. Affymetrix gene expres￾sion data were normalized using the guanine-cytosine content–adjusted 
robust multiarray algorithm (50). Thereupon, we employed a conserva￾tive probe-filtering step excluding probes not reaching a log2 expression 
value of 5 in at least one sample, which resulted in the selection of a total 
of 18,768 probes from the original set of 54,675. To identify genes dif￾ferentially expressed between the different microarray study groups, we 
employed significant analysis of microarray (SAM) (13). To graphically 
represent global gene expression differences between the different study 
groups, we used the entire filtered probe list to perform a correspon￾dence analysis employing the between-group-analysis (BGA) function 
included in the MADE4 package (51). To visualize the magnitude of the 
differential gene expression between tolerant and non-tolerant samples, 
we computed Q-Q plots for the Illumina and Affymetrix microarray 
expression datasets. Q-Q plots provide a visual comparison of two popu￾lations by displaying the sampled t statistic versus a theoretical t statis￾tic. In these plots, points that deviate from the linear relationship to the 
theoretical t statistic correspond to genes exhibiting differential expres￾sion. All liver tissue microarray data discussed in this publication have 
been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO GSE26627). 
Functional analysis of gene expression data was conducted using the 
R/Bioconductor package GOstats and the GO database (http://www.
geneontology.org). Only probes that could be associated with a unique 
EntrezGene ID were used. In cases where genes were targeted by mul￾tiple probes, genes were selected if at least one probe was significantly 
differentially expressed at an FDR of less than 25%. The hypergeometric 
distribution was used to evaluate the probability of randomly observing 
the enrichment for each GO term (52).
Liver tissue qPCR experiments. The expression of 104 target genes and 3 
housekeeping genes (Supplemental Table 3) was measured by qPCR on 
46 (18 operationally tolerant and 28 non-tolerant) of the 48 recipients 
constituting the Barcelona cohort, and in an independent group of 21 
(10 operationally tolerant and 11 non-tolerant) of the 23 recipients from 
Rome and Leuven. Four samples (2 from Barcelona and 2 from Rome) were 
excluded from the analysis due to quality control issues. Experiments were 
conducted employing the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System and Taq￾Man LDA microfluidic plates (Applied Biosystems). DNA was removed 
from total RNA preparations using Turbo DNA-free DNAse treatment 
(Ambion), and RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA using the 
High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). To 
quantify transcript levels, target gene Ct values were normalized to the 
housekeeping genes to generate ΔCt values. The results were then com￾puted as relative expression between cDNA of the target samples and a cali￾brated sample according to the ΔΔCt method. The following three samples 
were employed as calibrators: (a) pooled RNA from the 8 Ctrl-Tx samples; 
(b) pooled RNA from the 10 Ctrl samples; and (c) commercially available 
liver RNA (Human Liver Total RNA, Ambion). Target genes were selected 
based on: (a) Illumina and Affymetrix microarray experiment results; (b) 
blood transcriptional biomarkers previously described by our group as 
being associated with liver operational tolerance (19); and (c) prominent 
immunoregulatory genes described in the literature.

Identification and validation of gene classifiers on liver tissue samples. To 
develop biopsy-based qPCR gene expression predictive classifiers, we 
employed the linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression algo￾rithms implemented in misclassification penalized posterior (MiPP) soft￾ware (53). MiPP is based on a stepwise incremental classification model￾ing for discovery of the most parsimonious models and employs both a 
10-fold cross-validation and a random splitting cross-validation strategy 
to predict model performance and misclassification error rates. This was 
conducted on the whole data set of 67 samples (46 from Barcelona and 
21 from Rome and Leuven) by repeatedly partitioning it into training set 
(two-thirds) and an independent test set (one-third) for external model 
validation. The prediction performance and mean misclassification error 
rates were obtained for each of the candidate classifiers. Finally, for each 
candidate model identified, the optimal probability cutoff of operational 
tolerance was computed through a ROC analysis. To demonstrate that 
the performance of the models was not center dependent, we then com￾puted SN, SP, NPV, PPV, and overall error rates for the samples collected 
from Barcelona and those obtained from Rome and Leuven. To dem￾onstrate that the random splitting strategy did not yield unrealistically 
high prediction accuracies, we conducted a new search for genetic clas￾sifiers on the training set of 18 operationally tolerant and 28 non-toler￾ant recipients employing Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and 
validated them on the 21-sample independent test set. This resulted in 
the identification of 5 additional candidate models that classified sam￾ples with less than 15% error rates in both the training and the test set 
(data not shown).
Serum ferritin and HFE genotyping. Serum ferritin was measured at the 
Hospital Clinic Barcelona central laboratory using a commercially avail￾able automated ELISA assay (ADVIA Centaur, Siemens Healthcare Diag￾nostics). DNA samples from peripheral blood samples were genotyped for 
the nucleotide changes that correspond to the amino acid substitutions 
C282Y and H63D in the HFE protein using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) 
qPCR probes as described previously (54).
Serum hepcidin measurements. Baseline pre-weaning serum samples were 
available from 57 liver recipients (24 operationally tolerant and 33 non￾tolerant) before the initiation of drug minimization, from 14 operationally 
tolerant recipients 12 months after complete drug withdrawal, and from 
28 non-tolerant recipients 12 months after the rejection episode. Quanti￾tative serum hepcidin measurements were conducted by a combination 
of weak cation exchange chromatography and time-of-flight mass spec￾trometry (TOF-MS) (55). For quantification, a hepcidin analog (synthetic 
hepcidin-24; Peptide International Inc.) was employed as internal standard 
(56). Peptide spectra were generated on a Microflex LT matrix-enhanced 
laser desorption/ionization TOF-MS platform (Bruker Daltonics). Serum 
hepcidin-25 concentrations were expressed as nmol/l. The lower limit of 
detection of this method was 0.5 nM; average coefficients of variation were 
2.7% (intra-run) and 6.5% (inter-run) (57). Hepcidin serum levels were also 
obtained from a group of 80 non-transplanted individuals with normal 
ALT levels who were randomly selected from the 2,998 participants in the 
population-based Nijmegen Biomedical Study (58) after matching with 
operationally tolerant and non-tolerant recipients for age and sex.
Immunofluorescence quantification of intra-graft lymphocyte subsets. Up to 3 
FFPE sequential sections were analyzed per patient (15 operationally toler￾ant and 13 non-tolerant). Following deparaffinization and antigen retrieval 
steps, the following antibodies and reagents were employed: mouse anti–
human CD4 (clone BC/1F6), rabbit anti–human CD8 (clone SP16) (both 
from Abcam), goat CY5-conjugated anti-mouse (115-176-071, Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.), goat AF488-conjugated anti-rabbit 
(A11034, Invitrogen), rat biotin-conjugated anti–human FoxP3 (PCH101, 
eBioscience), Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (016-160-084, Jackson Imuno￾Research Laboratories Inc.), DAPI. Blocking, staining, and washing steps 
were performed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 at room 
temperature. To avoid unspecific binding, we blocked first with goat serum 
(5%) and, prior to the biotinylated antibody and streptavidin, separately 
with avidin (0.01%), biotin (0.005%) and mouse serum (5%). Fluorescence 
microscopy was carried out with an Axio Imager M1 at a magnification of 
×200 (Zeiss). Evaluation of portal infiltration and quantification of CD4-, 
CD8-, FoxP3-positive cells was performed with AxioVision 4.6 software 
(Zeiss) in a blinded fashion.
Flow cytometric experiments on peripheral blood samples. Whole blood sam￾ples were collected from all enrolled recipients at baseline to conduct flow 
cytometry immunophenotyping experiments. Titrated amounts of fluo￾rochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies were employed to identify 
naive and memory T cells (CD3, CD8, CD4, CD45RB, CD62L, CCR7, γδ
TCR, αβ TCR, Vδ1 TCR, Vδ2 TCR), B cells (CD19), NK cells (CD3, CD56, 
CD16), dendritic cells (CD14, CD3, CD19, CD20, CD123, CD11c, HLA￾DR), and regulatory T cells (CD4, CD127, Foxp3). Cells were fixed in 1% 
paraformaldehyde/PBS, and data were acquired on a BD FACSCanto flow 
cytometer (BD) and analyzed employing FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Blood gene expression profiling experiments. To define a blood transcription￾al fingerprint of operational tolerance, we first conducted an exploratory 
analysis employing Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays on 
PBMCs collected before the initiation of drug minimization from 20 oper￾ationally tolerant and 25 non-tolerant recipients (all from Hospital Clinic 
Barcelona). In 12 operationally tolerant and 14 non-tolerant recipients 
from the same group of 45 patients, microarray experiments were also con￾ducted on RNA samples collected 12 months after drug withdrawal or rejec￾tion. Due to the inter-laboratory variability inherent in the PBMC isolation 
procedure, these experiments were restricted to samples collected from 
patients enrolled at Hospital Clinic Barcelona. Total RNA was extracted 
from cryopreserved PBMCs using the TRIzol method, and Affymetrix 
microarray experiments were conducted as previously described (19). To 
identify genes differentially expressed between the different study groups, 
we employed RankProd (59) with a FDR less than 5% statistical thresh￾old. Microarray data were deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO GSE28842). To identify PBMC-related biological pathways signifi￾cantly associated with the operationally tolerant state, we employed Gene 
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (60, 61). For the current analysis, we used 
gene sets extracted from: (a) GO (62); (b) Molecular Signatures Database 
subset of canonical pathways (MSigDB version 3-0) (63); and (c) Haem￾Atlas blood cell lineage–specific gene set collection (64). Only gene sets 
with more than 15 genes were included in the analysis. Analyses were based 
on a t test and a weighted scoring scheme with 1,000 permutations.
The expression levels of a set of 94 target genes and 4 housekeeping 
genes (Supplemental Table 11) were measured in the same set of 45 base￾line RNA samples employing dynamic arrays and the Fluidigm BioMark 
qPCR platform with a pre-amplification step. The set of target genes 
included the 34 operational tolerance–related genes previously described 
by Martínez-Llordella et al. (19) together with some of the most informa￾tive targets derived from the Affymetrix microarray experiments conducted 
at baseline on PBMC samples. To quantify transcript levels, we normal￾ized the expression of the target genes to the mean of the housekeeping 
genes, and presented data as relative expression between cDNA of the 
target samples and a calibrated sample according to the ΔΔCT method. 
Differences in gene expression levels between tolerant and non-tolerant 
recipients were explored employing Student’s t test. Specific predictive 
models incorporating Fluidigm qPCR expression markers were defined 
employing the resulting posterior probabilities from leave-one-out cross￾validation included into the linear discrimination analysis function from 
the Modern Applied Statistics with S (MASS) package (65). DiagnosisMed

(http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/diagnosismed) and pROC libraries 
were employed to compute and plot ROC curves.
Statistics. Statistical significance was analyzed using GraphPad software, 
and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Normal 
distribution of samples was determined employing Kolmogorov-Smirnov, 
D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus, and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests. Upon 
normal distribution, an unpaired Student’s t test was used; in the other 
cases, a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was employed. If not other￾wise indicated, data are presented as mean ± SEM. The influence of differ￾ent variables on the probability of tolerance was adjusted in a multivari￾able logistic regression analysis using SPSS statistical software (IBM SPSS 
Inc.). To determine whether the group of genes of interest was significantly 
associated with clinical parameters, we employed global test software (66), 
which is based on an empirical Bayesian generalized linear model where 
the regression coefficients between expression data and clinical outcome 
are the random variables estimated using a goodness-of-fit test. A syntax 
within this software was also employed to correct the association found 
between gene expression and clinical outcome for the possible confound￾ing effects of nuisance clinical covariates. To assess whether the relation￾ship between ferritin and hepcidin was different in operationally tolerant 
recipients, non-tolerant recipients, and control individuals, we assessed the 
homogeneity of slopes in an ANCOVA analysis by testing the significance 
of the interaction in a model with hepcidin as a dependent variable, opera￾tional tolerance status as a fixed factor, and ferritin as a covariable.
Study approval. The study was approved by the institutional review boards 
of the three participating institutions, and written informed consent was 
obtained from all study patients.
