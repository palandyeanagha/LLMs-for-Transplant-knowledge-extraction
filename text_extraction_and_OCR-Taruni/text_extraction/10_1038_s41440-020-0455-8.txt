Abstract
The rapid spread of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an
ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been
shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells. Given that angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding
whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. On the other hand, animal data
suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of
acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, however, there is
no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or
aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present. Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB
and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially
those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
Introduction
A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syn￾drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered in
December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and an ongoing pan￾demic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been
spreading around the world as of early April 2020. The
clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic
upper respiratory infection to critically ill pneumonia
associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
[1–3]. In initial reports from China, the prevalence of older
age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular
disease (CVD) was high in COVID-19 patients, and indi￾viduals with these comorbidities tended to have greater case
fatality rates [3, 4]. In addition, it has been shown that
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection [5–7]. Given that
experimental studies suggested that angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) could
increase ACE2 expression in cardiovascular and renal sys￾tems [8–20], concerns may have been raised regarding
whether ARBs and ACEIs would augment the infection of
SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 in hyperten￾sion and CVD patients receiving these drugs [21]. In con￾trast, ARBs have potential benefits in the prevention and
treatment of lung injury caused by COVID-19 [22]. These
conflicting views appear to arise based on the results of
experimental studies, especially those of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), because
direct clinical data on COVID-19 are lacking at present.
SARS-CoV caused the SARS epidemic in China in
2002–2003, and its virological characteristics are closely

related to those of SARS-CoV-2 [23, 24]. Here, available
investigations on the association of the renin–angiotensin
system (RAS), particularly ACE2 and angiotensin II, with
SARS-CoV-induced lung injury and the latest information
on COVID-19 were reviewed as of early April 2020, which
would provide insight into COVID-19 and the direction of
future research on COVID-19.
ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS￾CoV-2
ACE2 belongs to the membrane-bound carboxydipeptidase
family and is widely distributed in the human body,
including the heart, kidney, small intestine, and, to a lesser
extent, the lung. Lung ACE2 expression is concentrated
mainly in type II alveolar cells and macrophages and
modestly in bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells [25].
ACE2 degrades angiotensin II to generate angiotensin 1-7,
which activates the mas oncogene receptor that negatively
regulates a variety of angiotensin II actions mediated by
angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) [26]. Therefore, it is
thought that the ACE2/angiotensin 1-7/mas receptor axis
has counteracting effects against the excessively activated
ACE/angiotensin II/AT1R axis, as seen in hypertension,
cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and other CVDs [26].
On the other hand, human ACE2 is an established
functional receptor by which SARS-CoV enters host target
cells (Fig. 1) [23, 24]. The transmembrane spike glyco￾protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV binds to the cellular
membrane ACE2; SARS-CoV then attaches to the target
cells, followed by SARS-CoV-S protein priming by cellular
surface proteases, such as transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2), allowing the fusion of viral and cellular
membranes and resulting in SARS-CoV entry and replica￾tion in the target cells [6]. Moreover, ACE2 knockout
greatly reduces viral infection and replication in mice after
experimental SARS-CoV infection [27]. Thus, it is sug￾gested that the binding of the SARS-CoV-S protein to
ACE2 is crucial for SARS-CoV infection.
Recently, it has been shown that the SARS-CoV-2-S
protein shares nearly 80% amino acid identity with the
SARS-CoV-S protein, and the binding affinity of the
SARS-CoV-2-S protein to human ACE2 is similar to that of
the SARS-CoV-S protein [5–7]. Anti-human ACE2 anti￾bodies or antisera can inhibit SARS-CoV-2-S protein￾mediated entry into cultured cells in vitro [5–7]. Accord￾ingly, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 for target cell entry as
well. However, it is still not clear whether ACE2 is the sole
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection because CD209L
(a glycoprotein of C-type lectin also called L-SIGN) is
identified as a possible secondary receptor for SARS-CoV
in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells [28].
ACE2 and acute lung injury

respiratory failure and lung parenchymal injury char￾acterized by alveolar wall thickening, pulmonary vascular

protein levels are greatly reduced, while ACE levels are
not changed [27]. These findings are consistent with the
previous observation that coronaviruses specifically
downregulate ACE2 expression in host cells, depending
on virus replication [29]. In addition, SARS-CoV-induced
acute lung injury is remarkably attenuated in ACE2
knockout mice compared with wild-type mice [27]. Lung
angiotensin II levels increase in wild-type mice after
SARS-CoV infection [27]. Acid aspiration mice, an
ARDS model, show functional and pathological changes
mimicking SARS-CoV-induced lung injury [30]. The
lung angiotensin II levels increase after acid aspiration,
and SARS-CoV-S protein treatment elicits a further
angiotensin II increase [27]. Interestingly, exogenous
recombinant ACE2 treatment rescues acid aspiration￾induced acute lung injury [30]. Taking this evidence
together, the following hypothesis has been raised for the
mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-induced lung injury:
SARS-CoV infection downregulates lung ACE2 and in
turn, shifts the balance toward the dominance of the ACE/
angiotensin II/AT1R system over the ACE2/angiotensin
1-7/mas receptor system in the lung. As a result, non￾competing angiotensin II accumulation occurs, resulting
in acute lung injury through AT1R activation [27].
It should be noted that a similar mechanism is proposed
for the severe lung injury caused by the avian influenza A
virus H5N1, which has spread worldwide in humans with a
high mortality rate. After H5N1 virus infection in mice,
lung ACE2 expression is downregulated, and serum
angiotensin II levels increase [31]. Acute lung injury is
augmented by ACE2 knockout in H5N1-infected mice,
while the administration of recombinant human ACE2
ameliorates H5N1-induced lung injury in mice [31].
Moreover, in other mouse models of acute lung injury/
ARDS, such as acid aspiration, sepsis, and drug-induced
lung fibrosis, it has been shown that ACE2 expression is
downregulated in response to noxious stimuli and that acute
lung injury is aggravated by ACE2 knockout and rescued
by exogenous ACE2 administration or AT1R knockout
[30, 32]. Accordingly, it is suggested that the angiotensin II/
AT1R-induced aggravation resulting from ACE2 down￾regulation and the protective effects of ACE2 are not spe￾cific to lung injury in SARS but rather may be common to
acute lung injury/ARDS induced by various viral infections
and lung diseases.
Effects of RAS inhibitors on ACE2 and SARS￾CoV-induced lung injury
Several kinds of ARBs (e.g., olmesartan, telmisartan,
losartan, and azilsartan) have been shown to increase the
mRNA or protein levels of ACE2 in animal models of heart
diseases (hypertensive hypertrophy, autoimmune myo￾carditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and
diabetic cardiomyopathy) [8–14] and chronic kidney dis￾ease (hypertensive nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy)
[15, 16], as well as normal rat heart and renal vasculature
[17, 18] and hypertensive rat aorta (but not the carotid
artery) [19, 20]. ACEI does not inhibit ACE2 as a phar￾macological property. In normal rats, lisinopril has been
shown to modestly increase cardiac ACE2 mRNA levels

while not changing cardiac ACE2 activity [17]. In the
myocardial infarction model, valsartan, ramipril, and their
combination have no effects on cardiac ACE2 expression
[33]. It should be noted that the doses of ARBs and ACEIs
used in these animal studies were much greater than those in
clinical practice so that the observed effects of these drugs
on ACE2 expression and activity could not be extrapolated
to clinical situations in humans. Importantly, no clinical
data exist regarding the effects of ARBs and ACEIs on
human tissue ACE2 expression or activity in vivo.
Although there are several clinical studies investigating the
changes in plasma or urine levels of the soluble form of
ACE2 in hypertension and CVD patients receiving ARBs or
ACEIs, the soluble form of ACE2 in the plasma and urine is
not a reliable indicator of the activity of tissue ACE2,
namely, membrane-bound ACE2 [22]. Importantly, there
are no data on the effects of ARBs and ACEIs on lung
ACE2 expression either in animal models or humans. It is
still unknown whether the changes in ACE2 levels (for
example, ARB-induced upregulation) actually facilitate
greater engagement and entry of SARS-CoV and other
viruses, even in animal models.
On the other hand, it has been shown that pretreatment
with losartan, an ARB, ameliorates acute pulmonary edema
and lung injury in SARS-CoV-S protein-treated mice after
acid aspiration (Fig. 2) [27]. Taken together with the lung
angiotensin II level elevation [27], this evidence suggested
that even after considering the speculation that viral load
would be enhanced by ACE2 upregulation, the net effects
of ARBs would be favorable to prevent SARS-CoV￾induced acute lung injury in this model. In addition, there
is another possibility that the ARB pretreatment-induced
baseline ACE2 increase prior to SARS-CoV infection
would result in higher ACE2 levels that remained after
SARS-CoV-induced downregulation and consequently
conferred protection against lung injury in this model
[22, 34]. However, in interpreting the results of this study, it
should be noted that the effects of losartan have been
observed merely in mice treated with SARS-CoV-S protein
in addition to acid aspiration but not in mice treated with
SARS-CoV-S protein alone. Additionally, data on lung
ACE2 levels before and after treatment with SARS-CoV-S
protein and acid aspiration are lacking in mice pretreated
with or without losartan.
Current evidence in COVID-19
Earlier studies reported that the case fatality rate was high in
COVID-19 patients with comorbidities such as older age,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, CVD, chronic pulmonary
disease, and malignancy [3, 4]. Because patients with
hypertension and CVD are likely treated with ACEIs or
ARBs, the concern is raised regarding whether the use of
ACEIs and ARBs may aggravate the morbidity and mor￾tality of COVID-19 [21]. However, it was possible that the
observed phenomenon would result from reverse causality
because older patients are at the highest risk for COVID-19
and concurrently tend to have multiple comorbidities,
including hypertension and CVD, and because adjustments
for age and other possible confounding factors were not
performed in such earlier studies [22, 35, 36]. Indeed, in a
recent retrospective, multicenter cohort study enrolling 191
confirmed COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, multi￾variable regression analysis revealed that independent
risk factors for in-hospital death are older age, higher
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and higher D￾dimer levels at the early stage of COVID-19, although
hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease were not
included [37].
A small case study reported that plasma angiotensin II
levels were markedly elevated and linearly associated with
viral load and lung injury severity in COVID-19 pneumonia
patients [38]. Given that a remarkable elevation of
circulating levels was also documented in various kinds of
cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, etc.), it is unknown
whether these findings of angiotensin II are the cause or
result of a systemic cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients
[39]. In the context of the effects of ARBs and AECIs, a
retrospective, single-center analysis enrolling 112 COVID￾19 patients showed that the use of ARBs and ACEIs had no
effects on the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19
patients with CVD [40]. Currently, a case-control study is
underway to clarify the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on the
severity of COVID-19 in Italy (NCT04318418).
Most importantly, at present, there is no large-scale study
with convincing evidence to determine whether ARBs
and ACEIs play a neutral, beneficial, or harmful role in the
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity and out￾comes of COVID-19 patients [22, 34–36, 41].
Potential therapies targeting ACE2 and
angiotensin II
In addition to vaccine development and antiviral agents, the
modulation of the RAS, especially by ACE2 and angio￾tensin II, is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target for
COVID-19. Based on an animal study suggesting the ben￾eficial net effects of ARB in SARS-CoV-infected acute lung
injury mice [27], multicenter, double-blinded placebo-con￾trolled, randomized trials (RCTs) are currently being con￾ducted to investigate the effects of losartan on mortality and
hospital admission in COVID-19 patients requiring hospital
admission (NCT04312009) and not requiring hospital
admission (NCT04311177), respectively.

Recombinant ACE2 is another candidate to prevent
COVID-19 pneumonia. As described above, the efficacy of
exogenous recombinant ACE2 has been shown in animal
models of acute lung injury/ARDS [30, 31]. It is also
possible that the circulating soluble form of ACE2 may act
as a decoy receptor that binds to SARS-CoV-2 and com￾petitively inhibits virus entry to host target cells mediated
by membrane-bound ACE2. To investigate the efficacy of
human recombinant ACE2 in the treatment of COVID-19
patients, a randomized, controlled, pilot clinical study was
planned (NCT04287686). However, this study was with￾drawn on March 17, 2020.
TMPRSS2 is a membrane protease for ACE2 priming,
which is a crucial step for the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 and
target cell membranes and the resultant viral entry into the
cells [6]. Nafamostat mesylate and camostat mesylate are
TMPRSS2 inhibitors that have been used for the treatment
of acute pancreatitis in Japan. Currently, a clinical trial
evaluating the efficacy of nafamostat and camostat for
treating COVID-19 is underway in Japan (https://www.u￾tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/articles/z0508_00083.html).
Risk limits of RAS inhibitor therapy in the
COVID-19 pandemic
The concern regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs may have
harmful effects on the morbidity and mortality of COVID￾19 patients is based on the speculation that these drugs
would upregulate ACE2, a receptor for SARS-CoV-2,
which would increase the viral load and then augment lung
injury. However, the evidence of ACE2 upregulation is
limited only in animal studies using the relatively high
(namely, pharmacological) doses of several ARBs and one
ACEI. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the ARB/
ACE-induced ACE2 increase actually enhances the sus￾ceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or SAR-CoV. Importantly, no
clinical studies exist supporting that ARBs and ACEIs
augment susceptibility to infection and worsen (or improve)
all-cause and cardiovascular outcomes in not only COVID￾19 patients but also SARS patients at present. Therefore, the
hypothesis underlying the concern would not be readily
extrapolated to humans, particularly to COVID-19 patients.
In patients with heart failure, prior myocardial infarction,
other CVDs, and cerebrovascular disease, the benefit of
ARBs and ACEIs has been established in the improvement
of quality of life and survival outcomes, while the dis￾continuation leads to new onset or exacerbation of heart
failure, CVD, and stroke and the worsening of the prognosis
[42]. Thus, RAS inhibitors should be continued in high-risk
patients who have received guideline-directed medical
therapy (GDMT). In general, switching from one to another
class of antihypertensive agents does not infrequently result
in destabilization of blood pressure control and requires
frequent visits for drug titration to achieve appropriate and
stable blood pressure control and to avoid adverse effects.
Blood pressure destabilization increases the incidence of
heart failure, stroke, and other CVDs. In addition, frequent
visits to the clinic or hospital expose patients to a greater
risk of infection in a COVID-19 pandemic situation.
Accordingly, even in stably controlled hypertension patients
without compelling indications, it is thought that not only
simple discontinuation but also switching from ARB or
ACEI to other antihypertensive agents should be avoided
unless physicians make a decision based on specific
considerations.
Cardiovascular comorbidities are common in COVID-19
patients, and such patients are at great risk for morbidity and
mortality [1–4]. Myocardial damage ranging from silent
troponin T elevation to fulminant myocarditis has been
documented in COVID-19 patients [35]. In confirmed or
suspected COVID-19 patients, ACEI and ARB medications
are recommended for the treatment of heart failure and other
CVD according to GDMT based on the available evidence
at this time [35].
In conclusion, at present, the use of ARBs and AECIs
should not be withheld in established standard therapy for
not only high-risk patients such as those with heart failure,
prior myocardial infarction, other CVD, and cere￾brovascular disease but also patients with hypertension in
stable condition according to the recent statements released
by the European Society of Hypertension, the European
Society of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association/
Heart Failure Society of America/American College of
Cardiology [43–45]. The evidence on COVID-19 is being
accumulated each day. Large-scale clinical studies with
convincing evidence, not only RCTs but also real-world big
data analyses as well as experimental studies, are awaited to
solve the question of whether ARBs and ACEIs have
neutral, favorable, or harmful effects on the susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 and the severity and outcomes of COVID-19.
Finally, we should learn from the lessons of COVID-19
without being bound by common sense in the ante-COVID￾19 era. In addition, we should reconstruct a novel strategy
for the treatment of hypertension and CVD in the post￾COVID-19 era.
