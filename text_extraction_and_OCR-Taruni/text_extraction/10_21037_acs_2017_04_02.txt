Tricuspid valve regurgitation (TVR) in the orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipient is quite common and 
has varied clinical sequelae. In its severest forms, it can lead to right-sided failure symptoms indistinguishable 
from that seen in native heart TVR disease. While certain implantation techniques are widely recognized to 
reduce the risk of TVR in the cardiac allograft, concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty, while having advocates, 
is not currently accepted as a routinely established adjunct. Decisions to surgically correct TVR in the OHT 
recipient must be made carefully, as certain clinical scenarios have high risk of failure. Like in the native 
heart, anatomic etiologies typically have the greatest chances for success compared to functional etiologies. 
While repair options have been utilized, there is emerging data to support replacement as the more durable 
option. While mechanical prostheses are impractical in the heart transplant recipient, biologic valves offer 
the advantage of continued access to the right ventricle for biopsies in addition to acceptable durability in the 
low pressure system of the right side.

Perspective
Introduction
Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) remains the gold 
standard therapy for advanced heart failure refractory to 
medical management. Currently, the number of OHTs 
performed annually worldwide has remained static at 
approximately 4,000, limited mainly by donor organ 
availability. The median survival of 11 years following OHT 
has remained consistent throughout time with the major 
limitation being allograft vasculopathy. 
Tricuspid valve regurgitation (TVR) in the donor 
allograft is the most common valvular complication 
following heart transplantation with a reported incidence 
of up to 84% (1). This high rate likely reflects a liberal 
application of the diagnosis towards a dynamic process 
that has many etiologies, ranges of severity, and clinical 
significance. While the majority of TVR in the post￾transplant patient is mild and clinically insignificant, 
approximately 34% lies in the moderate to severe range 
resulting in to decreased quality of life due to symptoms 
such as peripheral edema, exertional dyspnea, and fatigue (2). 
Up to 5.8% of patients develop refractory symptoms to the 
extent where surgical correction is warranted (3). It is thus 
a major cause of morbidity and has an associated mortality 
quoted as high as 62.5% (4). These numbers are likely an 
over-simplification of the impact of TVR on the transplant 
patient as ultimate symptoms, prognosis, and outlook 
depend greatly on the etiologies and clinical scenarios 
leading to the valvular incompetence.
In this article, we will review the etiologies of tricuspid 
regurgitation in the cardiac transplant allograft, their varied 
pathophysiologies, and finally surgical indications for repair 
or replacement.
Etiology of tricuspid regurgitation
Functional tricuspid regurgitation
Like the native heart, TVR in the cardiac allograft has 
both functional and anatomic etiologies. One of the 
predominant mechanisms of the former is geometric 
distortion of the tricuspid annulus often influenced at the

time of transplantation. Shortly after the technique of bi￾caval anastomosis was introduced by Yacoub and colleagues 
in 1989 (5), there were multiple single center reports of 
improved TVR over time when compared to the standard 
bi-atrial technique (6,7). The enlarged right atrial size of 
the combined atria in the bi-atrial technique was thought 
to exacerbate the development of TVR by increasing both 
wall tension and tricuspid annular size during systole (8). In 
addition to anatomic distortion, the bi-atrial anastomosis 
was also thought to lead to asynchronous atrial contractions 
leading to further dilation over time.
Bi-caval anastomosis alone, however, is not sufficient to 
prevent the development of TVR. Tension in the bi-caval 
anastomosis is considered a risk factor for the development of 
TVR by many implanting surgeons as stretching of the right 
atrium results in distortion of the tricuspid annulus. One group 
found that modifying the inferior vena caval anastomosis with 
augmentation by the donor heart with a flap of the recipient’s 
right atrium leads to a reduction in TVR to trace or mild in 
all study participants (9). The issue with many of these single 
center studies, however, is that they were underpowered and 
failed to demonstrate protection from TVR at time periods 
longer than 1 month (10). A more recent review of the United 
Network for Organ Sharing database failed to demonstrate 
a survival benefit following comparison with logistic 
regression and a proportional hazard model between patients 
transplanted using the bi-caval versus bi-atrial technique (11). 
Functional TVR is also due to progressive annular 
dilation. Like its left side atrioventricular cousin, this is 
predominantly a problem with the right ventricle rather 
than a valvular issue which has obvious implications for 
subsequent repair. RV failure, for example, can result 
from high pulmonary vascular resistance. While reversible 
pulmonary hypertension (PH) has not been associated 
with adverse transplant outcomes, fixed PH remains a 
contraindication for this therapy mainly due to the resultant 
right sided volume and pressure overload. Echocardiographic 
assessment of patients with tricuspid regurgitation and 
PH demonstrates that the RV not only dilates, but also 
increases in length along the superior-inferior axis leading 
to valvular tethering and reduced coaptation (12). Tricuspid 
regurgitation in these settings is a particularly vexing 
conundrum as repair or replacement options that fix the 
regurgitation may do little to influence overall RV function. 
While re-transplantation is considered in these situations, 
there may be little to support the idea that the new heart 
will behave any differently than the original when faced with 
ongoing elevated pulmonary vascular resistances. 
Perhaps the most encouraging data revolves around 
remodeling of the pulmonary circuit pre-transplant with 
mechanical circulatory support devices of the left ventricle. 
When bridged to transplant with left ventricular assist devices 
(LVADs), patients with what was once thought to be fixed 
PH, albeit due to left-sided failure, had similar post-transplant 
outcomes to those without PH (13). Indeed, by offsetting 
pulmonary vascular resistance, it has been observed that 
LVADs improve RV function, thereby minimizing TVR and 
obviating the need for concomitant tricuspid valve repair (14). 
The presence of intraoperative TVR of moderate or 
greater severity adversely impacts long term survival to the 
extent that some advocate for concomitant tricuspid valve 
annuloplasty at the time of heart transplantation (15). A 
series of 60 heart transplant patients all performed using 
bi-caval technique were divided into two groups. The first 
received heart transplant alone while the second group 
received concomitant DeVega tricuspid annuloplasty. 
Average length of follow up was approximately 6 years 
and while there were no differences in survival, the latter 
group had decreased average TVR (1.5±1.3 vs. 0.5±0.4, 
P=0.01 and a lower percentage of 2+ or greater TVR (34% 
vs. 0%, P=0.01) (16). The authors assert that given these 
advantages, that concomitant tricuspid valve repair should 
be considered as a routine adjunct to heart transplantation. 
Many question the durability of the DeVega or any non￾rigid annuloplasty procedure, however, in this setting (17). 
While performing tricuspid annuloplasty on the ex vivo
heart is quite straightforward, it is not broadly accepted 
as standard of care both at our institution or worldwide as 
there remains clear lack of consensus regarding definitive 
benefit outside of single center experiences. 
Increased episodes of acute rejection greater than 
International Society for Heart & Lung Transplantation 
(ISHLT) Grade 2 was also correlated to increased TVR due 
to mechanisms of papillary muscle edema and dysfunction 
as well as asymmetric contractility of the RV (18). Despite 
resolution of the acute rejection episodes, this study found 
that TVR increased over the time of surveillance with an 
incidence of 38% and 62% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. 
When rejection episodes lead to subsequent RV failure 
there is a significantly higher rate of death and/or 
retransplantation at 1 year (OR =4.80, P=0.007) (19). 
Anatomic tricuspid regurgitation
Biopsy related TVR
Numerous studies have demonstrated a causal link

between the number of endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) 
and the development of TVR. EMB is the current 
standard of care in routine graft surveillance and typically 
has a preponderance in the early time period following 
transplantation. Chordal damage resulting in flail leaflets 
is the presumed mechanism and development of TVR 
has been correlated to the number of biopsies performed. 
While frank leaflet tissue is a rather uncommon finding in 
EMB specimens, the presence of chordal tissue is a well￾documented phenomenon with one series showing 47% of 
patients with new onset TVR having evidence of chordae 
in their myocardial specimens (20). In another series, there 
were no cases of severe TVR in patients who have had 
fewer than 18 biopsies whereas in patients with over 31 
procedures, 60% developed severe TVR (21). The authors’ 
recommendations were thus to configure protocol biopsies 
to a regimen of less than 31 over the lifetime of the 
allograft to help reduce the risk of development of severe 
iatrogenic TVR.
Endocarditis
While heart transplant recipients are immunosuppressed, 
the development of endocarditis is a relatively rare event 
compared to other infections. One review of the literature 
documented 10 cases out of 659 patients transplanted 
over an 11-year period. Five of these cases involved the 
tricuspid valve with a 100% mortality following diagnosis. 
Once again, EMB was implicated as a risk factor due to 
increased susceptibility of the damaged valve to bacterial 
seeding. Patients with TV endocarditis had a median of 23 
EMB compared to patients with mitral valve infection who 
had only nine. Their review of the literature documented 
only 22 cases of transplant allograft endocarditis with 
involvement of the right sided atrio-ventricular valve in 
seven (22%). It is not clear from the paper if valve surgery 
was attempted in this cohort or if clinical futility prevented 
this option (22). 
Pathophysiology of TVR in the heart transplant 
recipient
The pathophysiology of severe tricuspid regurgitation in 
the transplanted heart is not unlike that which exists in 
native valve pathology. Loss of coaptation of the tri-leaflet 
valve whether it be from functional or anatomic etiologies 
results in regurgitation of blood in systole leading to the 
combination of elevated right sided pressures as well as 
decreased forward cardiac output. In the severest forms, the 
resulting venous hypertension can lead to clinical sequelae 
of ascites, peripheral edema, and hepato-renal dysfunction. 
Over time, the pressure and/or volume overload can lead to 
worsening RV function with a decrement in forward cardiac 
output that can be difficult to discern from that caused by 
acute rejection. 
Obviously, when functional TVR is present alongside left 
sided heart disease, symptoms associated with both disease 
processes may be superimposed such as shortness of breath, 
exercise intolerance, and overall weakness, malaise, and 
failure to thrive. 
Surgical indications for tricuspid valve repair or 
replacement
Multiple studies have shown that the majority of TVR 
that develops following heart transplantation does not 
lead to symptoms significant enough to warrant surgical 
repair (2,4,6). In the minority of patients, however, for 
whom TVR leads to medically refractory symptoms, repair 
and replacement options have been employed. Filsoufi 
and colleagues’ study identified 8 out of 138 transplanted 
patients who required surgery for symptomatic severe 
TVR. They were divided into two groups of four based on 
etiology of either annular dilation (functional TVR) or flail 
leaflet due to biopsy induced chordal rupture (anatomic 
TVR). Valve repair was attempted in all 8 patients. What 
was notable was a 50% failure rate in the anatomic group 
requiring subsequent reoperation for valve replacement 
within a 2-week interval. The functional group also 
had 50% failure with repair requiring tricuspid valve 
replacement, however, this occurred at a longer time period 
following surgery at 10 months and 4 years, respectively. 
All patients survived during the follow up period of this 
study (3). Another data base study performed by the Utah 
Transplantation Affiliated Hospitals Cardiac Transplant 
Program found 17 patients over a 20-year interval who 
required 16 TV replacement and 2 repair procedures due 
to medically refractory symptoms. A flail leaflet was the 
cause of TVR in all but one of the patients. There were two 
mortalities in their series and improvement in symptoms 
was seen in 12 of the patients following surgery (23). 
These studies allude to two important concepts in 
tricuspid valve surgery in the heart transplant recipient. 
The first is that like native heart valve disease, indications 
for surgery may be more straightforward when there is an 
anatomic valvular issue. In our experience, creating “annular 
solutions for ventricular problems” that are often the cause 

Annals of cardiothoracic surgery, Vol 6, No 3 May 2017 273

of functional TVR can be fraught with numerous pitfalls. 
That is not to say there is no utility in reversing the volume 
and pressure overload in patients with central TVR due 
to non-coapting leaflets from annular dilation. However, 
these patients need to be carefully selected. For example, 
the combination of intrinsic PH, RV failure, and TVR 
is particularly ominous and these patients are unlikely to 
benefit long term from tricuspid valve surgery and carry a 
high risk for operative mortality in our experience. 
The second important point from the data above is the 
possible advantage of replacement over repair particularly 
in the anatomic group. Replacement is associated with 
improved symptoms in surviving patients and seems to have 
the added benefit of durability when compared to repair 
options (24). With regards to valve type, mechanical valves 
would be undesirable due to the inability to subsequently 
perform EMBs and the need for anticoagulation. The 
biologic valve, on the other hand, appears to have excellent 
long-term durability in the low-pressure system of the 
right heart, does not require anticoagulation, and affords 
ongoing ability to perform biopsies. There might even 
be an advantage of low risk of subsequent injury as the 
chordal apparatus is now taken out of the picture and 
actual prosthetic valve leaflet injury from EMB is a rare 
occurrence. 
Conclusions
TVR is a common entity following heart transplant 
and has varying implications for the patient. In most 
instances, the degree of severity is mild to moderate and 
is not associated with clinical sequelae requiring operative 
intervention. In those cases where medical treatment alone 
is inadequate, however, symptoms are not unlike that seen 
in patients with native TVR such as edema, hepato-renal 
dysfunction, and ascites. It is imperative, however, that 
careful attention be placed towards proper patient selection. 
As in native heart valvular disease, the best outcomes 
are seen with variants of TVR where RV function is still 
preserved. Great caution must be exercised when assessing 
functional TVR particularly in the setting of ongoing high 
pulmonary vascular resistance as this combination makes 
operative strategies including valve replacement and re￾transplantation hazardous. Strategies to ameliorate the risk 
of TVR performed at the time of transplantation such as the 
construction of bi-caval as well as tension free anastomoses 
appear to be well established. Concomitant tricuspid valve 
annuloplasty at the time of OHT, however, while having 
advocates, is not as yet a commonly accepted practice.
