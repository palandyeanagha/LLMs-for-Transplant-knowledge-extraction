Odievre, M., Gautier, M., Hadchouel, M., and Alagille, D. (1973). Archives
of Disease in Childhood, 48, 806. Severe familial intrahepatic cholestasis. Five
cases of intrahepatic cholestasis are reported in 4 families in which 7 other children
have had the same disease. Cholestasis, beginning before the age of one year, is
notable for the absence of lipid retention, evolving by attacks brought on by inter￾current infections with gradual development of fibrosis and fatal cirrhosis before the
age of 15. Extrahepatic and interlobular bile ducts are undamaged.
The disease is sometimes accompanied by biliary and pancreatic abnormalities,
perhaps due to an abnormality in the biliary acid metabolism.
A particular form of intrahepatic cholestasis was
first described in 1965 by Clayton et al. It is
characterized by an alteration in the excretion of
bilirubin, biliary acids, and bromsulphalein. It
presents with the features of familial cholestatic
cirrhosis, with a gradually fatal course. Since 1965,
other cases have been published (Clayton et al.,
1969; Gray and Saunders, 1966; Hirooka and Ono,
1968; Linarelli, Williams, and Phillips, 1972;
Williams et al., 1972.)
The present work relates the clinical and
biological study and the course of development of 5
new cases belonging to 4 different families.
Case reports
Case 1. A girl was born on 20 November 1964
weighing 2 - 4 kg. At one year of age (during an attack of
pharyngitis), she presented with jaundice, dark urine,
acholic stools, pruritus, and hepatomegaly, lasting for 6
months and worsening during each intercurrent infection.
The second attack took place at the age of 28 months
during bronchitis; the liver then remained large and hard.
The child was taken to hospital at the age of 4 because
cholestasis persisted despite long-term steroid therapy.
The parents are first cousins; a brother and sister are
in good health; one brother died at the age of 21 months
from cirrhosis after a long history of cholestasis which
began at the age of 3 weeks; her twin sister is Case 2.
On admission the child measured 93 cm (-2 SD) and
her weight was 127 kg (-2 SD). Examination showed
jaundice, dark urine, partially acholic stools, intense
pruritus, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests
showed retention of bilirubin and bromsulphalein and

increase in alkaline phosphatase (Table I). Laparotomy,
performed during regression of cholestasis, showed a
large irregular liver and slender but permeable extra￾hepatic ducts containing thick black bile. The operation
was completed by cholecystostomy and liver biopsy.
Histological examination of the liver specimen showed
moderately hypertrophic portal triads which sometimes
became linked. These spaces contained a few round
cells. The interlobular bile ducts were present and
empty. Ductular formations were rare. Intralobular
collagen was thickened, particularly in the periportal
areas. Hepatocytes appeared normal, but were often
grouped in pseudoacini.
After 5 weeks' external drainage, bilirubinaemia was
0 8 mg/100 ml, the bromsulphalein test was normal, and
pruritus had disappeared. However, 11 days after the
removal of the drain, pruritus reappeared, bromsulphalein
excretion was again abnormal, bilirubin rose to 4- 6
mg/100 ml, and alkaline phosphatase to 261 IU. Treat￾ment with cholestyramine (8 g/day) was ineffective, as
was cholecystojejunostomy (Y loop). Cholestyramine
dosage was doubled to 16 g/day, also without effect. At
the age of 5, the 'attack' suddenly ceased, but in￾completely, the child still having moderate pruritus and a
large liver. From 5 to 8 years of age there were several
episodes of cholestasis associated with tonsillitis and
lasting from 1 to 3 months. At the age of 6, x-rays
showed pancreatic calcifications. Needle liver biopsy
showed a slight increase in the portal fibrosis with an
annular tendency.
Case 2. The twin sister of Case 1, weighing 2 kg at
birth. The first attack of cholestasis took place at the
age of 4 months with jaundice, acholic stools, and pruritus
occurring over the course of several weeks. The second
attack was at age one year, decreasing after 6 months,
with fluctuations corresponding to seasonal infection.
At age 2, after an attack of tonsillitis, a new attack lasting

3 weeks was followed by many others, remissions
becoming less and less noticeable and the liver remaining
large.
At the age of4 she was taken to hospital, measuring 88 5
cm(-3 SD) and weighing 12.6 kg(-2 SD). Jaundice
and pruritus were severe and liver and spleen were
enlarged. Biological tests were comparable with those
of her sister (Table I).
Laparatomy showed a larger liver and lesions of
chronic cholecystitis with 3 large calculi in the gall￾bladder; the head of the pancreas had the appearance of
chronic pancreatitis. Peroperative cholangiography
showed a slender but permeable bile duct. Histological
examination of the liver biopsy showed highly hyper￾trophic portal triads with many ductular formations,
which made the definite identification of interlobular bile
ducts difficult. There were some inflammatory cells.
Periportal intralobular fibrosis was prominent.
Hepatocytes were normal (Fig. 1).
When the cholecystostomy drain was removed,
bilirubinaemia was 0 7 mg/100 ml, alkaline phosphatase
170 IU, bromsulphalein retention 34% at 15 minutes
and 8% at 45 minutes. A relapse occurring 6 weeks
later resisted cholestyramine (12 g/day) and lasted 2
months. Two other attacks took place at 5 years of age
associated with pharyngitis, and one at 61 years associated
with bronchitis. The liver remained large and firm
between the attacks; histological investigation of the liver

showed aggravated lesions. Ductular proliferation was
evident and there were many inflammatory cells.
Case 3. A girl was born on 2 November 1966,
weighing 3*4 kg. Jaundice was noticed at 10 months,
and was preceeded by considerable pruritus starting at 8
months. The parents are unrelated. A sister is
healthy; another sister died at the age of 2i years with
liver cirrhosis and pruritus, and without atresia of intra￾or extrahepatic bile ducts.
At the age of 11 months she was taken to hospital
measuring 75 cm (+ 1 SD) and weighing 8 kg. Jaundice,
dark-coloured urine, partially acholic stools, severe
pruritus, and hepatosplenomegaly were noted.
Biological tests showed retention of bilirubin and
bromsulphalein; alkaline phosphatase was moderately
increased (Table I). Laparotomy was performed
showing the bile to be greenish and viscous in the
gallbladder; washing with serum brought back a mucous
plug and then the rest of the bile ducts were easily
opacified. Peroperative cholangiography showed
normal extrahepatic bile ducts and small-sized intra￾hepatic bile ducts. Histological examination of the liver
biopsy specimen showed a distinct annular fibrosis, while
portal triads were moderately thickened. Interlobular
bile ducts were present. There were neither ductular
formations nor inflammatory cells. In contrast, there
was a well-marked intralobular fibrosis predominating in
the centrolobular areas. The hepatocytes were clarified
and swollen in the periportal areas.
Pruritus recurred at 19 months during chickenpox,
though cholestyramine treatment had not been
interrupted; jaundice reappeared 4 months later and the
attack lasted 10 months. At 3i years of age portal
hypertension appeared. During the next year there
were many attacks occurring with intercurrent infections,
one of which was mumps. The child died at the age of
41 from cirrhosis with jaundice and ascites.
Postmortem histological investigation showed distinct
annular fibrosis with portal spaces all hypertrophic.
However, no regeneration nodules were seen. There
were no ductular formations, but a few round cells were
shown (Fig. 2). Intralobular fibrosis had greatly
increased and had become almost dissecting.
Case 4. A boy was born on 23 August 1969, weighing
2- 8 kg. Jaundice and partial acholic stools were noticed
at 4 months during an infection. The parents are
unrelated. He is the youngest in a family of 11 children.
The second (a boy), sixth (a girl), and seventh (a boy)
children died from cholestatic cirrhosis at the ages of 8
years, 17 months, and 5 years, respectively; all 3 children
developed jaundice between the ages of 6 and 9 months,
pruritus following about 2 months later. The other
children are healthy.
He was taken to hospital at the age of 6 months
measuring 61 cm (-2 SD) and weighing 4 9 kg (-3
SD). Jaundice was moderate, urine dark-coloured,
stools normal; liver and spleen were enlarged.
Laboratory tests showed moderate bilirubin retention,
increase in alkaline phosphatase, and abnormal retention
of bromsulphalein (Table I). At laparotomy the liver
was large and firm. The extrahepatic bile ducts were
normal. Peroperative cholangiography showed a
normal and permeable bile duct. Histological
examination of the liver biopsy showed normal portal
triads without signs of fibrosis or inflammation and no
ductular formation. Hepatocytes were little modified,
but clearer in the areas of maximum biliary retention
(Fig. 3).
Prednisone (1 5 mg/kg per day) had no effect.
Pruritus appeared at 8 months, and at 10 months the

child measured 63 cm ( -4 SD) and weighed only 5 * 3 kg
(-4 SD). Cholestasis persisted and cholestyramine (8
g/day) was prescribed. This treatment having also
failed, the dose was doubled at the age of 16 months and
the attack ceased 3 months later, though the liver
remained large. Histological investigation by needle
biopsy showed some portal hypertrophy that did not
exist a year earlier. Interlobular bile ducts were still
present but empty. At 28 months cholestyramine
treatment was interrupted, and 3 days later pruritus, and
later jaundice, reappeared; abnormal bromsulphalein
retention was 52% at 15 minutes and 32% at 45 minutes.
The attack lasted 5 months followed by incomplete
remission, leaving an enlarged and hard liver.
Case 5. A girl was born on 24 January 1962.
Jaundice began on the 8th day of life with acholic stools;
histological examination of the liver showed the
appearance of hepatitis with giant cells. Numerous
attacks of cholestasis and pruritus, one after the other,
took place until the age of 61 years, when she was taken
to hospital. The parents are unrelated. One brother
died at 23 months with a large liver and jaundice; another
brother died at 19 months with a large liver and with
cholestatic jaundice which he had with varying intensity
since the age of 8 days. A sister, age 11 years, is in good
health. On admission the child measured 101 cm (-3
SD) and weighed 19 kg (-1 SD). The liver was large
and hard; the spleen was also enlarged. Laboratory
tests showed bilirubin retention, increased alkaline
phosphatase, and abnormal retention of bromsulphalein
(Table I). Laparotomy showed a large nodular liver;
the gallbladder was tense and contained stones.
Peroperative cholangiography showed good duodenal
passages. Cholecystostomy was performed. Histo￾logical examination of liver biopsy specimen showed
nodular cirrhosis with moderate inflammation. Inter￾S1B
lobular bile ducts were present but empty. There were
few ductular formations. Hepatocytes were light, large,
and sometimes polynucleated (Fig. 4).
The child died 3 weeks later from hepatocellular
insufficiency.
Discussion
The clinical picture in these 5 children was
identical to that of 16 published cases (Clayton et al.,
1965, 1969; Gray and Saunders, 1966; Hirooka and
Ono, 1968; Linarelli et al., 1972; Schubert, 1965;
Williams et al., 1972).
The cholestatic syndrome was incomplete.
Jaundice was of varying intensity, accompanied by
dark-coloured urine and partially acholic stools.
Pruritus was generally severe; hepatomegaly was
persistent. In all cases bilirubinaemia was
increased (predominantly conjugated). Injected
bromsulphalein was abnormally retained. In
contrast, the total cholesterol and total lipids of the
serum remained normal, even when cholestasis
lasted several months. An exception was Case 2 of
Williams et al. (1972) with significant lipid retention
accompanied by cutaneous xanthoma, and also the
case of Linarelli et al. (1972) where moderate
cholesterolipid retention was noted. Alkaline
phosphatase was moderately increased. Biliary
acids in the serum were not measured in our cases.
In each case prolongation of cholestasis led to
laparotomy to ascertain the permeability of the
extrahepatic bile ducts. In each of our cases, the
liver was enlarged, greenish, regular, or already
nodular (Case 5). These findings are identical to
the other 10 published cases in which laparotomy

was performed (Clayton et al., 1969; Gray and
Saunders, 1966; Hirooka and Ono, 1968; Williams
et al., 1972.)
Histological examination of the liver in 4 cases
showed portal fibrosis with a moderate number of
round, inflammatory cells. In Case 3 there was
also a marked intralobular fibrosis, almost dissecting,
predominating in the centrolobular areas. In Cases
1 and 2 the portal fibrosis was accompanied by
marked ductular formation. The histological
picture in Case 4 was quite different since the portal
space appeared entirely normal at the age of 7
months, whereas there was already an annular
fibrosis in Case 3 at the age of one year. Develop￾ment of the portal fibrosis was observed each time
that repeated examinations were possible, as has
been noted in published reports.
The disease follows a uniform course.
Cholestasis progresses by attacks interrupted by
remissions. In 3 of our cases the first attack
occurred before the age of 6 months, in 2 cases
between 6 and 10 months. When reviewing all
known cases and the 7 sibs of our patients, the first
symptoms appeared before the age of 6 months in 14
cases, between 6 and 12 months in 14 cases, and
never appeared after 12 months. Each attack was
related to an intercurrent infection, enabling us to
foresee relapses in our cases; the parents of some of
our patients asked for prophylaxis of common
childhood infections, hoping to prevent clinical and
biological relapse. Among the signs of cholestasis
pruritus is often the first, followed sooner or later by
the other signs of the disease. In our cases each
attack lasted from a few days to 20 months. It is a
fact that remission was never complete, since
hepatomegaly was always observed between the
attacks. Remissions became less and less distinct,
and failure to thrive gradually became apparent,
while the liver became hard and irregular, indicating
that cirrhosis was gradually developing.
Of our 5 patients, 2 died: one (Case 3) at the age
of 41 without a true cirrhosis, the other (Case 5) at
6j years with cirrhosis, the histology of which
revealed regeneration nodules. In our 4 families, 6
sibs suffering from the disease died before the age of
5, and the seventh at the age of 8. Among the 28
cases known, 23 died of digestive bleeding due to
portal hypertension or of decompensated cirrhosis,
more rarely during superinfection. 15 of these
deaths occurred before the age of 5, 5 between 5 and
10 years, and 3 between 10 and 15 years of age. 3 of
our children are still alive; one (Case 4) has early
portal fibrosis, and the other two who are older
(Cases 1 and 2) have more serious fibrosis.
Laparotomy in all our cases showed the absence of
any obstacle in the principal bile duct; it is necessary
in fact to be quite sure that the extrahepatic bile
ducts are completely permeable in all cases of
chronic cholestasis in children. Laparotomy also
permitted major biopsy of each lobe in every case.
This appeared necessary to us in order to rule out
completely the possibility of atresia of the intra￾hepatic bile ducts which can cause incomplete and
long-lasting cholestasis (Alagille et al., 1969); these

Severe familial intrahepatic cholestasis
bile ducts are easily recognized when there is no
portal fibrosis, though they may be extremely
difficult or even impossible to recognize when the
clinical picture has evolved sufficiently and cirrhosis
has already set in. Accurate identification of
interlobular bile ducts was possible in all cases
except Case 2. It is because these bile ducts could
not be identified in the cases reported by Juberg et
al. (1966)-cases that also had lipid retention-that
we think it is wise, in contrast with other authors,
not to include Juberg's work in our discussion.
The recurrent character of attacks of cholestasis
should prompt discussion of other causes of chronic
cholestasis: benign recurrent cholestasis (Summer￾skill and Walshe, 1959) and the type of familial
cholestasis described by Aagenaes, Van der Hagen,
and Refsum (1968) have a quite different course of
development. It may be added that our patients
were given no drug likely to cause cholestasis.
Treatment is of limited value. Cholecystostomy
was carried out in 4 of our cases and appeared to be
effective in Cases 1 and 2, but signs of cholestasis
reappeared as soon as the catheter was removed.
Drainage was ineffective in Case 3 and it was
impossible to assess its role in Case 5; the same was
true in the case of the sister of Case 3. However,
internal biliary diversion later carried out in Case 1
proved ineffective. External biliary drainage
appeared effective in one of the cases of Williams et
al. (1972), but its effect was doubtful in one case
reported by Gray and Saunders (1966) and non￾existent in one case of Clayton et al. (1969). In the
latter case internal biliary derivation carried out
later also proved ineffective.
Of our 5 patients, 4 were given cholestyramine.
Only Case 4 appeared to benefit from this treatment.
A similar favourable result was reported by Clayton
et al. (1969) and Linarelli et al. (1972) in one each of
their cases. In all other cases in which
cholestyramine was administered for a sufficient
length of time, there was no favourable effect. This
disagreement between the results may perhaps be
explained by insufficient dosage. It should be
noticed, however, that of our 4 patients, the only one
to benefit from the treatment was the youngest, at an
age when portal fibrosis was still moderate.
The familial character of the disease is un￾questionable in our 5 cases. The fact that 12
children in 4 families were affected suggests a
recessive autosomal transmission; the consanguinity
in the family of our Cases 1 and 2 argues in favour of
this theory. These facts are in agreement with
what is found in published reports, though 2 cases
were isolated children; the report by Schubert
(1965) concerned an adopted child and that of
Linarelli et al. (1972) had a family relationship with
the families published by Clayton et al. (1969).
Until a biochemical definition of the disease is
established, it will remain difficult to authenticate
isolated cases in the absence of any familial context.
Recent publications (Linarelli et al., 1972; Williams
et al., 1972) note the abnormal presence of lithocholic
acid in the serum of these children at the same time
as a low level of excretion of normal biliary acids.
We have made no precise study of the metabolism of
biliary acids in our cases, and the possibility of
cholestasis depending on different mechanisms from
one family to another cannot be excluded. The
relative frequency of associated anomalies in all
cases might be an indirect argument in favour of an
abnormality in the biliary acid metabolism. As
shown in Table II, a certain number of facts can be

established in our cases and in those published
reports. We thus noted the existence of a large
gallbladder in 2 of our cases (Cases 3 and 5), and
gallstones were also found in 2 cases, without the
chemical composition of the calculi being studied.
In several cases laparotomy revealed the existence of
inspissated bile or a 'bile plug'. The appearance of
'chronic pancreatitis' in one of our cases (Case 2),
and later proof of pancreatic calcifications in 3 cases
are unusual. The toxic effects of lithocholic acid
and its derivatives are beginning to be better
recognized, at least in animals (Palmer, 1969).

the principal bile duct (Palmer, 1969; Zaki et al.,
1967). Biliary salts have also been involved in the
aetiology of pancreatitis (Hansson et al., 1963). If
the data concerning abnormal metabolism of biliary
acids in these children were to be confirmed, the
cases presented here could constitute an example in
man of cholelithiasis and pancreatic pathology
induced secondarily by this disorder of metabolism.
The portal consequences of cirrhogenous cellular
reaction of the ducts develop at the same time.
