Chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, however, the pathogenic factors
and mechanisms are not fully understood. Pulmonary emphysema is one of the major components of COPD and is thought to
result from oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, protease–antiprotease imbalance and lung epithelial (LE) cell apoptosis. In
our previous studies, COPD patients were noted to have higher levels of placenta growth factor (PlGF) in serum and
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than controls. In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing PlGF developed pulmonary emphysema
and exposure to PlGF in LE cells induced apoptosis. Furthermore, intratracheal instillation of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)
on to PlGF wild type mice induced emphysema, but not in PlGF knockout mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that PPE generates
pulmonary emphysema through the upregulation of PlGF expression in LE cells. The elevation of PlGF then leads to LE cell
apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated whether PPE induces PlGF expression, whether PlGF induces apoptosis and
whether the downstream mechanisms of PlGF are related to LE cell apoptosis. We found that PPE increased PlGF secretion and
expression both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, PlGF-induced LE cell apoptosis and PPE-induced emphysema in the mice were
mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. Given these
findings, we suggest that the increase in PlGF and PlGF-induced JNK and p38 MAPK pathways contribute to PPE-induced LE cell
apoptosis and emphysema. Regulatory control of PlGF and agents against its downstream signals may be potential therapeutic
targets for COPD.

Chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) is the
fourth leading cause of death worldwide with high mortality
and morbidity rates even under advanced medical care.1
Emphysema is a major component of COPD and is
characterized by destruction and enlargement of the alveolar
region through chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and
protease–antiprotease imbalance.2,3 However, the factors
and pathogenic mechanisms that cause COPD are not fully
understood.4 Apoptosis of lung epithelial (LE) cells is one of
the potential factors involved in the pathogenesis of COPD.5
Tsao et al.6 demonstrated that exogenous placenta growth
factor (PlGF) induced LE cell apoptosis and inhibited
cellular proliferation, and that the transgenic mice with
over-expressed PlGF developed emphysema phenotype,
suggesting that PlGF has an important role in the pathogen￾esis of emphysema.
PlGF belongs to a family of vascular endothelial growth
factors (VEGF) and the major biological function of PlGF is
promoting angiogenesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR￾1) signaling.7,8 PlGF expresses in the placenta, heart, lung,
thyroid, brain and skeletal muscles.9 Increasing evidence
suggest that PlGF expressed in LE cells may contribute to the
progression of COPD. Cheng et al.10 reported that patients
with COPD had higher levels of PlGF in serum and
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and that the level of PlGF
was inversely related to lung function. Moreover, cigarette
smoke, a major factor related to COPD, has been found to
increase PlGF expression in rat lungs.11 Furthermore,
ablation of PlGF has been found to protect mice from porcine
pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced emphysema.12 However,
the detailed mechanisms underlining PlGF-induced LE cell
apoptosis and the pathogenesis of emphysema remain to be
elucidated.
PPE is a protease that can induce protease–antiprotease
imbalance and has been applied in an animal model of
emphysema and COPD.13 Previous studies have

demonstrated that leukocyte elastase increases lung and
intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis.14,15 Neutrophil elastase
(NE) has been shown to increase the expression and
secretion of elafin in type II alveolar epithelial cells.16
Moreover, NE has also been shown to increase the expres￾sion of MUC4 and MUC5AC17,18 and promote the secretion of
mucin and expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in human
bronchial epithelial cells.19,20 Other than LE cells, NE has
also been shown to upregulate cathepsin B and matrix
matelloprotease-2 (MMP-2) in macrophages.21 To date, the
mechanisms by which elastase induces LE cell apoptosis
have not been established. In this study, we hypothesized that
PPE generates LE cell apoptosis and pulmonary emphysema
through the expression of PlGF and PlGF-mediated down￾stream signaling.
We found that PPE increased PlGF mRNA and protein
expressions in vivo and in vitro. PPE stimulates PlGF promoter
activity by early growth response-1 (Egr-1) and Egr-1 response
element. Moreover, PlGF induced LE cell apoptosis in a dose￾dependent manner, and chronic treatment of PlGF increased LE
cell apoptosis. Furthermore, PlGF activated c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathways, both of which were involved in PlGF-induced LE cell
apoptosis and PPE-induced pulmonary emphysema in mice.
These novel findings may provide possible therapeutic strate￾gies for emphysema and COPD.
Results
PPE treatment increased PlGF expression and secretion
in LE cells. Previous study indicated 100 mU/ml NE
increases elafin gene expression in A549 cells16 and PlGF
is majorly secreted by alveolar type II epithelial cells.6,22
Therefore, the mouse LE cells, mouse alveolar type II
epithelial cells (MLE-15), were treated with 0–60 mU/ml PPE
for 24 h to test whether PPE could induce PlGF expression.
The secretion of PlGF into the medium was promoted by
60 mU/ml PPE treatment (Figure 1a). In MLE-15 cells, the
mouse PlGF promoter region (2.5 kb)-driven luciferase activity
indicated that 60 mU/ml PPE increased the mouse PlGF
promoter activity by about threefold (Figure 1b). The results of
reverse transcriptional (RT)-PCR and western blot demon￾strated that 60 mU/ml PPE upregulated the expressions of
PlGF mRNA and protein in the MLE-15 cells (Figures 1c and
d). To study the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of PPE
on PlGF expression, we analyzed the sequence of human
PlGF promoter region and identified a speculated Egr-1
response element (CCCGCCCC) within 100 bp from transcrip￾tional start site.23,24 Western blot demonstrated that 60 mU/ml
PPE transiently increased the expressions of Egr-1 in MLE-15
cells (Figure 1e). The data of chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay showed that the exposure to 60 mU/ml PPE for 1 h would
promote the association of Egr-1 protein and PlGF promoter
region (Figure 1f). These findings confirmed that PPE
increased PlGF expression and secretion in mouse LE cells.
Exogenous PlGF induced LE cell apoptosis. Previous
study indicated that 100 ng/ml PlGF induced MLE-15
cell apoptosis.6 In this study, MLE-15 cells were treated with
0–100 ng/ml mouse recombinant PlGF for 24 h. Exogenous
PlGF dose-dependently increased the level of apoptosis in
the MLE-15 cells according to the results of the caspase-3
activity assay (Figure 2a), trypan blue inclusion analysis
(Figure 2b), flow cytometric assay (Figure 2c) and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay (Figure 2d). Because the level of cells with
trypan blue stain is similar to FITC-positive cell and a few
annexin V-positive cells in cytomertic assay, PlGF majorly
induced apoptotic cellular death rather than necrotic
cellular death in LE cells. In addition, S cells were treated
with 0–100 ng/ml human recombinant PlGF for 24 h. The
results of the caspase-3 activity assay demonstrated that
PlGF also increased human LE cell apoptosis in a dose￾dependent manner (Figure 2e). Our previous study indicated
co-treatment of 50 pg/ml PlGF, 200 pg/ml interleukin-8 (IL-8)
and 200 pg/ml tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) for 14 days
induced S-cell apoptosis.10 To mimic the chronic damage
conditions in COPD, the S cells were treated with 800 pg/ml
human recombinant PlGF for 14 days. The dose of PPE was
dependent on PPE-induced PlGF secretion in S cells
(data not shown). Chronic treatment with 800 pg/ml PlGF
resulted in a similar apoptotic level as Figure 2e (Figure 2f).
Taken together, these results confirmed that both 24 h and
14 days of treatment of PlGF increased LE cell apoptosis.
Exogenous PlGF activated JNK and p38 MAPK pathways
in LE cells. To elucidate the detailed mechanism involved in
PlGF-induced LE cell apoptosis, we treated MLE-15 cells
with 100 ng/ml PlGF for 0–24 h. According to the results
of western blot, PlGF induced prolonged and enhanced
phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK after 6 h of treatment
(Figures 3a and b). But PlGF had no significant effect on
other signaling pathways like Akt and NFkB (Supplementary
Figure 1S). The 14-day treatment of S cells with 800 pg/ml of
PlGF also increased the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK
(Figures 3c and d). These results suggest that the JNK and
p38 MAPK pathways may have crucial roles in PlGF-induced
mouse and human LE cell apoptosis.
Inhibition of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways abrogated
PlGF-induced LE cell apoptosis. To evaluate the roles of
JNK and p38 MAPK in PlGF-induced LE cell apoptosis,
MLE-15 and S cells were pretreated with inhibitors of JNK and
p38 MAPK, SP 600125 and SB 203580, respectively, to block
the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. According to the results of
the caspase-3 activity assay (Figure 4a), trypan blue inclusion
analysis (Figure 4b), flow cytometric assay (Figure 4c)
and TUNEL assay (Figure 4d), blockage of the JNK and
p38 MAPK pathways caused attenuation of apoptosis in the
PlGF-treated MLE-15 cells (100 ng/ml for 24 h). In addition,
inhibition of the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling decreased
the level of apoptosis in PlGF-treated MLE-15 (100 ng/ml for
24 h) and S cells (800 pg/ml for 14 days) as shown in caspase￾3 activity assay (Figures 4e and f). These results strongly
confirmed that JNK and p38 MAPK signaling are involved in
PlGF-stimulated mouse and human LE cell apoptosis.
Intratracheal PPE instillation increased PlGF expression
and secretion and downstream JNK and p38 MAPK
pathway activation. The role of PlGF in PPE-induced LE

cell apoptosis and emphysema was evaluated in an animal
model. C57BL/6 mice were intratracheally instillated with
saline (CON) or 100 mU/ml PPE (PPE) weekly for one
month. The pulmonary cells of the PPE-treated mice
displayed more expression of PlGF than the control mice,
and the induced-PlGF majorly presented in LE cells (arrow￾heads in Figure 5a). The induction of PPE on PlGF
expression as well as activation of JNK and p38 MAPK were
further confirmed by western blot analysis (Supplementary
Figure 2S). Moreover, PPE-treated mice displayed more
phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK levels than the control
mice (arrowheads in Figure 5a). In addition, the BAL fluid of the
PPE-treated mice had higher PlGF levels than that of the
control mice (Figure 5b). These results demonstrated that PPE
instillation increase PlGF expression, activation of JNK and
p38 MAPK, and PlGF secretion in the pulmonary cells of mice.
PlGF and PlGF-activated JNK and p38 MAPK path￾ways were involved in PPE-induced apoptosis and
emphysema in mice. To evaluate the roles of PlGF, JNK
and p38 MAPK signaling in PPE-induced emphysema,
50 mg/kg of SP 600125 (JNK inhibitor), 50 mg/kg SB
603580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), 3 mg/kg scramble siRNA and
3 mg/kg PlGF siRNA were co-treated with PPE instillation
(PPE SP, PPE SB, PPE Sc-si and PPE Pl-si) weekly for one
month. Both RT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed
the attenuation of PlGF expressions by PlGF siRNA
(Supplementary Figure 3S). TUNEL assay indicated apo￾ptotic cells in pulmonary tissue (Figure 6a), and the
PPE-treated mice had a higher level of pulmonary apoptosis
than the control mice (Figure 6c). Moreover, the PPE￾treated mice had the emphysema phenotype with enlarge￾ment of the alveolar space (Figure 6b) as evaluated by

Figure 1 Treatment of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) increased the expression and secretion of placenta growth factor (PlGF) in lung epithelial (LE) cells. Mouse
alveolar type II epithelial cells, MLE-15, were washed twice with PBS then incubated in the medium without serum and treated with 0–60 mU/ml PPE for 24 h (a–d), 4 h (e) or
1h (f). The level of PlGF in the culture medium was detected by ELISA (a). The activity of PlGF promoter in the cellular lysate was evaluated by luciferase activity (b).
The mRNA level of PlGF was determined by reverse transcriptional PCR with primer sets for PlGF and GAPDH cDNA (c). Cellular lysates were also subjected to western blot
analysis with antibodies for PlGF (d) or Egr-1 (e) and b-actin. The association of Egr-1 and PlGF promoter was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (f). Data are

mean linear intercept (MLI) (Figure 6d). In addition,
blockage of the JNK and p-38 MAPK pathways (PPE SP
and PPE SB) and silencing of PlGF (PPE Pl-si) attenuated
the levels of PPE-induced pulmonary apoptosis (Figures 6a
and c) and the air space enlargement in PPE-treated mice
(Figures 6b and d). Collectively, our in vivo experiments
further confirmed that the PPE-increased pulmonary PlGF
and the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were
involved in PPE-induced pulmonary apoptosis and emphy￾sema in vivo.
Discussion
Several studies have reported that elastase, a serine protease,
induces epithelial cell apoptosis. Leukocyte elastase damages
the intestinal epithelial cells via loss of mitochondrial integrity,
and decreasing Akt and increasing JNK signaling.15 Moreover,
the leukocyte elastase-induced LE cell apoptosis has been
shown to be mediated by protease-activated receptor-1, and
retinoic acid has been shown to abrogate leukocyte elastase￾induced LE cell apoptosis.14,25 Different from previously
established mechanisms, our results showed for the first time
that PPE resulted in LE cell apoptosis through PPE-induced
PlGF expression and PlGF-mediated downstream JNK and
p38 MAPK signaling pathways.
Our study demonstrated that treatment of 60 mU/ml PPE for
24 h increased PlGF expression and secretion in LE cells.
Tsao et al.6 had shown that treatment of 100 ng/ml PlGF for
24 h triggered MLE-15 cell apoptosis at the same level as our
finding in this study. According to this condition, we indentified
JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are involved in PlGF￾induced LE apoptosis. Moreover, treatment of PPE induced

secretion of B600 pg/ml PlGF in culture medium from LE cells
and instillation of PPE induced secretion of B100 pg/ml PlGF
in BAL from mice. The difference in the level of PlGF secretion
may result from difference in treatment interval and environ￾mental complexity. Our data showed that PPE-induced PlGF
expression and secretion, and PlGF-mediated apoptosis
occurred, at least in part, in LE cells. The results of this study
offer an explanation that COPD patients contain higher
levels of PlGF in serum and BAL than non-COPD ones.
Furthermore, the knock down of PlGF by siRNA attenuated
PPE-induced emphysema and pulmonary apoptosis directly
proved that upregulated PlGF has vital role in pathogenesis of
emphysema and COPD.
The pathogenesis of COPD is chronic airway inflammation
due to neutrophil and macrophage recruitment26,27 followed
by the secretion of NE and matrix metalloprotease.
A protease–antiprotease imbalance may modify gene expres￾sion profiles in LE cells to overcome the extracellular stimuli.
Previous studies have indicated that NE increases the
expressions of elafin, MUC4 and MUC5AC, and the secretion
of elafin and mucin in LE cells.16–19 In bronchial epithelial
cells, NE has also been shown to upregulate the expression of
IL-8 through Toll-like receptor-4 signaling.20 Using mouse LE
cells, PPE was shown to induce the expression of PlGF
mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner in the present
study. According to previous studies, the expression of PlGF
in lung tissue was upregulated by hypoxic stimuli and lung
stretch23,28 and 1.5-kb upstream promoter region was
sufficient for hypoxia induction.23 We also validated that
PPE-induced PlGF mRNA expression was mediated by the
interaction of Egr-1 protein and Egr-1 response element in
PlGF promoter.
COPD is a major cause of death worldwide.29 The levels
of airway inflammation and obstruction may insidiously
progress, and the early diagnosis and treatment is usually
difficult due to the lack of pathognomonic clinical symptoms.
Effective biomarker for early detection and therapeutic agents
for COPD remain elusive.30,31 Cigarette smoke, the major
factor related to COPD, has been proven to increase PlGF
expression.11 In this study, we demonstrated that PPE￾induced protease–antiprotease imbalance, the pathogenic
mechanism for COPD, increased the expression of PlGF.
In future studies, we will explore the mechanisms, such as
DNA methylation, small nucleotide polymorphism and micro￾RNA, associated with the regulation of PlGF expression.
We hypothesize that PlGF is a prognostic or predictive
biomarker for COPD.
Kinase inhibitors for JNK and p38 MAPK have been
used as experimental therapeutic strategies in patients with
COPD.32,33 In the pathogenic processes of COPD, p38
MAPK signaling has been found to have roles in the
activation of inflammation cascade and infiltration of immu￾nocytes in vivo and in vitro.
34 One clinical trial demonstrated
a better clinical efficacy in COPD patients receiving p38
MAPK inhibitor therapy.35 Our results also demonstrated
additional beneficial effects of using JNK and p38 MAPK
inhibitors in COPD therapy. First, ablation of JNK and p38
MAPK signaling prevented the PlGF-induced LE cells
apoptosis, which is a potential mechanism for COPD.
Second, inhibition of JNK and p38 MAPK activity attenuated

PPE-induced emphysema, which is the major component of
COPD.
In conclusion, PPE increased PlGF expression and
secretion both in LE cells and lung parenchyma of mice.
The contribution of PlGF toward LE cell apoptosis and
emphysema development were through JNK and p38 MAPK
pathways. Downregulation of PlGF expression and agents
inhibiting PlGF-associated downstream signals may be
potential therapeutic targets for emphysema and COPD.

Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis. Treated or untreated
MLE-15 and S cells were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer (Genestar, Taipei, Taiwan),
which contained 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate and 50 mM Tris with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Bionovas, Toronto,
Canada) and PhosSTOP (Roche, Basilea, Switzerland). Cellular lysates
were centrifuged at 12 000 r.p.m. for 5 min and the resulting supernatant was
collected. The extracted protein was quantified by protein assay. Equal amounts of
protein were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, MA, USA). After blocking with
5% skimmed milk, the membranes were incubated with various primary antibodies
and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies. The protein
bands were detected using an Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP
Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and quantified by ImageQuant 5.2
software (Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Philadelphia, PA, USA).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Genomic DNA fragment from
treated- or untreated-MLE-15 cells were prepared by the EZ-Zyme Chromatin
Prep Kit (Millipore) and analyzed by the Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Assay Kit (Millipore) to evaluate the associated level of Egr-1 and PlGF promoter
region. The antibody of Egr-1 was used for immunoprecipitation and the primer set
(50
-CAG AGG TCA CTT AAG TAC CCA GCC ATC T-30 and 50
-ATA AGC TTT
GCA GTC TGC CTG AGC ATC C-30
) were used for amplify of mouse PlGF
promoter according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

analyzed on an FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (Becton Drive, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the FITC￾positive cells were analyzed by a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Drive).
Immunohistochemistry assay. Paraffin was removed from paraffin￾embedded tissue sections from the mice by xylene, dehydrated by ethanol and
rehydrated by PBS. After treatment of 3% H2O2, the sections were applied to a
SuperSensitive Polymer-HRP IHC Detection System (Biogenex) and incubated
with PlGF, p-JNK and p-p38 MAPK antibodies as the primary antibodies.
The stained sections were analyzed by a Leica DM 4000B microscope (Leica).
H&E stain. Paraffin was removed from paraffin-embedded tissue sections from
the mice by xylene, dehydrated by ethanol and rehydrated by PBS. The sections
stained with hematoxylin and eosin were then analyzed by a Leica DM 4000B
microscope (Leica).
PPE-induced emphysema. The intratracheal instillation of PPE into the
C57BL/6 WT mice was performed as described previously.11 In brief, eight-week￾old mice were instilled intratracheally with saline (CON), 100 mU/ml PPE (PPE),
100 mU/ml PPE with 50 mg/kg JNK inhibitor SP600125 (PPE SP), 50 mg/kg p38
MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (PPE SB), 3 mg/kg scramble siRNA (PPE Sc-si) and
3 mg/kg mouse PlGF siRNA (PPE Pl-si) weekly for one month. The dose of siRNA
instillation was according to previous study.36 There were five mice in each group.
Lung tissue and BAL fluid collection were performed as described previously.10
Statistical analysis. The results are presented as mean±S.E.M. from five
independent repeats and animals. The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare
two independent groups. Kruskal–Wallis followed by Bonferroni post-hoc analysis
was used for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
version 8.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value o0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
