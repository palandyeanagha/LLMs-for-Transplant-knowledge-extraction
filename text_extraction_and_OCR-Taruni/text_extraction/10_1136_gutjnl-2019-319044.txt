Role of portal venous platelet 
activation in patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis 
and TIPS
We read with interest the recent study 
by Lv et al,
1
 who pointed out that tran￾sjugular intrahepatic portosystemic 
shunt (TIPS) placement is feasible for 
prevention of variceal rebleeding in the 
majority of cirrhotic patients with portal 
vein thrombosis and that it is more 
effective than endoscopic band ligation 
plus propranolol. Moreover, associa￾tion with a higher probability of portal 
vein recanalisation and a lower risk of 
subsequent rethrombosis was described. 
However, even after TIPS, in eight out 
of 24 patients, either portal or superior 
mesenteric vein thrombosis persisted 
or reoccurred. While development and 
progression of splanchnic venous throm￾botic events implicate disease progres￾sion in cirrhosis,2
 their pathogenesis 
remains unclear. According to Virchow’s 
triad, pathological coagulation/platelets, 
decreased flow and impaired vascular
wall are the drivers of thrombosis. In 
TIPS, flow is restored and, to a large 
extent, also the shear stress (the vascular 
wall compenent) due to decompression 
of portal hypertension. However, the 
prothrombotic milieu (platelet and plas￾matic coagulation) has not been investi￾gated to date. One hypothesis for this is 
the platelet activation due to lipopolysac￾charide (LPS)-linked inflammation in the 
portal venous vascular bed.3
 Moreover, 
recent data have demonstrated that the 
gut microbiome is related to hepatocel￾lular carcinoma, which is also associated 
with decreased platelets.4
 Therefore, the 
interaction between platelet activation in 
the portal venous compartment and the 
microbiome might be a mechanism, as 
recently confirmed in various diseases.3 5
To address this hypothesis, TIPS insertion 
provides a unique opportunity to access 
portal circulation. In 20 patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis, we measured 
portal and hepatic vein levels of LPS, 
soluble glycoprotein VI, soluble P-se￾lectin and soluble NOX2-derived peptide
(sNOX2-dp) as representatives of bacte￾rial translocation, in vivo platelet acti￾vation and oxidative stress as previously 
described6 (see online supplementary 
1). Here, platelet activation occurred 
increasingly more often in the portal 
than in the hepatic vein, and this was 
associated with disease severity (Model 
for End-Stage Liver Disease score), even 
in the presence of thrombocytopenia (see 
figure 1). Indeed, aggregation of platelets 
in cirrhosis might lead to obliteration and 
parenchymal extinction depending on 
disease severity.7
 As a potential cause for 
platelet activation, we detected increased 
levels of LPS in the portal vein, reflecting 
bacterial translocation. Furthermore, 
we found high oxidative stress levels in 
the portal vein detected by markers of 
NOX2 activation (sNOX2-dp), deriving
from activated immune cells as a readout 
for inflammation, suggesting that this 
LPS inflammation possibly contrib￾utes to platelet activation (see figure 2). 
Extended bacterial translocation in 
advanced liver disease, as a trigger for 
activation of inflammatory cells in the 
portal vein7
 and potentially of platelets, 
is biologically plausible and provides

further insights into the development of 
thrombotic events in liver cirrhosis, even 
in case of thrombocytopenia and TIPS 
insertion.
In the majority of our patients, an inva￾sive procedure was performed to re-eval￾uate function and position of TIPS. Indeed, 
baseline sNOX2-dp levels, even after adjust￾ment for disease severity, showed a strong 
correlation to reduced portal venous flow 
in control angiography (See figure 2), as an 
indirect sign for a prothrombotic milieu in 
the portal vein.
In conclusion, decompensated liver 
cirrhosis leads to enhanced platelet acti￾vation in the portal vein. Bacterial trans￾location and/or oxidative stress may 
contribute to this and possibly increase the 
risk of thrombogenesis in decompensated 
liver cirrhosis.
