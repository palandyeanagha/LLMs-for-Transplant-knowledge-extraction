A B S T R A C T The effect of dexamethasone on erythro￾poiesis was examined in vitro. Hematopoietic cells from
13-day mouse fetal livers were cultured for 48 h in the
presence or absence of erythropoietin and erythroid
colonies enumerated. Colony formation occurring in
cultures containing no added erythropoietin was inhibited
by the incorporation of antierythropoietin antibody, sug￾gesting that these colonies formed in response to en￾dogenous hepatic erythropoietin. Maximal colony forma￾tion was observed with 0.5 U/ml of sheep erythropoietin.
Dexamethasone increased erythroid colony formation
with peak stimulation at 10- M. Dexamethasone poten￾tiation was most marked in cultures containing less than
maximally stimulating concentrations of erythropoietin.
The cells required only a brief exposure to glucocorticos￾teroid to exhibit the augmented cloning capacity, and
dexamethasone stimulation was inhibited by proges￾terone (10 M). A comparable response to dexametha￾sone was observed in cultures of adult murine and hu￾man bone marrow erythroid progenitors, implying that
the phenomenon is not peculiar to fetal cells and is not
dependent on the presence of fetal hepatocytes. These
data suggest that erythroid progenitor cells possess a
glucocorticoid receptor mechanism that can modulate
the response to erythropoietin in vitro.
INTRODUCTION
Although erythropoietin is the primary humoral regu￾lator of red blood cell production in mammals, relatively
little is known about the factors modulating the interac￾tion of erythropoietin with target cells (1). Erythro￾poietin presumably interacts with a receptor on the sur￾face of certain red cell progenitors (2). Stimulation of
these erythropoietin-sensitive cells results in a series
of replicative and maturational steps culminating in the
production of mature erythrocytes. Various hormones
are known to influence hematopoiesis (3). Androgenic

steroids and other steroids with a 5f-H configuration
increase red cell production both in vivo and in vitro by
direct and indirect mechanisms (4). Androgenic ster￾oids appear to stimulate granulopoiesis as well (5, 6).
The role of glucocorticosteroids in erythropoiesis is
uncertain. Glucocorticoids have been used in the treat￾ment of aplastic anemia and may improve red cell pro￾duction in a congenital abnormality of erythropoiesis
(Diamond-Blackfan syndrome). We report here that
dexamethasone potentiates the erythropoietin-stimulated
proliferation of red cell progenitors in vitro. The dexa￾methasone effect may involve an augmented sensitivity
of progenitor cells to erythropoietin in vitro.
METHODS
Fetuses of white Swiss-Webster mice were obtained at 12i￾13i days' gestation. The fetal livers were dissected out and
single cell suspensions prepared by repeated aspiration
through a no. 25 needle. The method of Iscove et al. (7)
was used for cloning erythroid progenitors in vitro. Cells
were plated in enriched alpha medium with 30%o fetal calf
serum and antibiotics, with a supporting matrix of 0.8%
methyl cellulose. Dithiothreitol (10-' M) or a-thioglycerol
(10-' M) was included in all plates (8, 9). For most ex￾periments, 10' viable nucleated cells were dispersed in 1-ml
cultures in 35-mm plastic dishes (Falcon Plastics, Division
of Bioquest, Oxnard, Calif.). Additions to the cultures in￾cluded Step 3 sheep plasma erythropoietin (Connaught
Laboratories, Toronto, Canada) and human urinary erythro￾poietin (provided by the Blood Resources Division, Heart
and Lung Institute, National Institutes of Health). Dexa￾methasone, prednisone, and progesterone (Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, Mo.) were dissolved in 100%o ethanol and
diluted to appropriate concentrations with complete tissue
culture medium. Control cultures were prepared containing
equivalent concentrations of ethanol. Rabbit antierythro￾poietin antibody was a gift of Dr. A. Ichiki, Knoxville,
Tenn. The cultures were incubated at 37'C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5%o C02 in air for 48 h. Erythroid colonies
of eight cells or more were enumerated by using an inverted
microscope. Colonies were stained with benzidine after
transfer to slides to confirm their erythroid nature (7).
Similar cultures were prepared with young adult Swiss￾Webster mouse bone marrow. Normal human bone marrow
was obtained from informed volunteers by aspiration and
the nucleated cells were isolated by centrifugation in
Wintrobe tubes. The same culture technique was used for

RESULTS
Some erythroid colonies developed from fetal mouse
liver cells plated in methyl cellulose containing no added
erythropoietin. The addition of antierythropoietin anti￾body largely abrogated this spontaneous colony forma￾tion (Table I), suggesting that these colonies formed in
response to endogenous erythropoietin produced by the
fetal liver (12-14) or perhaps also to erythropoietin in
the fetal calf serum. Erythropoietin-stimulated erythroid
colonies in fetal liver hematopoietic cell cultures were
found to be linearly related to the number of cells plated.
Dose-response curves consistently showed maximum
colony formation with 0.5 U of sheep erythropoietin
(Table II). At this dose, colony formation was increased
approximately fivefold over control cultures. 100 IAl of
antierythropoietin antibody serum reduced the erythro￾poietin-stimulated colony formation to below control
levels (Table I). A series of culture experiments were
run to test for the effect of ethanol. Ethanol, in concen￾1Abbreviation used in this paper: CFU-E, colony-forming

tions greater than 10' M. Stimulation was observed
between 10' M and 1010 M, with peak effect (mean of
82% stimulation) noted at 10' M (Fig. 1).
In the presence of maximally stimulating concentra￾tions of erythropoietin, the dexamethasone effect on
numbers of CFU-E was less pronounced. With 10 M
dexamethasone, colony formation increased by a mean
of 27% in the presence of 0.5 U of sheep erythropoietin
(Fig. 2). A similar pattern was observed with predni￾sone, though peak stimulation occurred at 10-7 M (Ta￾ble III).
The glucocorticoid stimulation of erythroid colony
formation in vitro did not require that the hormone be
present in the tissue culture plate. The effect was ob￾served when the cells were exposed to dexamethasone
for 1 h, washed, and then plated. Since progesterone is
known to block glucocorticoid binding to the receptors of
other types of cells (15) and interfere with the transport
of the receptor complex to the nucleus (16), experi￾ments were performed to ascertain the effect of simul￾taneously added progesterone on the glucocorticoid
stimulation of erythropoiesis. Progesterone (10' M)
was found to abrogate the glucocorticoid effect on the
numbers of fetal erythroid colonies (Table IV). This

effect was observed in cultures containing no erythro￾poietin as well as in those containing maximally stimu￾lating concentrations of erythropoietin. Progesterone
itself at 10' M was found to have no effect on erythro￾poiesis but was toxic at 108 M.
In an attempt to define the mechanism of dexametha￾sone-stimulated erythropoiesis, erythropoietin dose-re￾sponse experiments were repeated with and without
dexamethasone (10 M). These studies showed that the
glucocorticoid augmentation of erythropoiesis was great￾est at levels of erythropoietin below those causing maxi￾mal stimulation (Table V). Similar phenomena were
observed with human and sheep erythropoietin. Dexa￾methasone did not increase erythroid colony formation
in the cultures containing antierythropoietin antibody
(Table VI), implying that the steroid had no direct
stimulatory effect.
Studies were performed with adult mouse bone mar￾row in order to be certain that the observations were
not peculiar to the fetal liver hematopoietic cell cul￾TABLE VI

ture system. Murine marrow cells showed an erythro￾poietin dose-response effect like that of fetal liver cells.
Maximal stimulation occurred at 0.5 U of sheep erythro￾poietin. Dexamethasone (10' M) caused a substantial
number of colonies to appear in cultures not containing
added erythropoietin (Table VII). The dexamethasone￾induced augmentation of cloning in cultures to which
erythropoietin was added was comparable to that seen in
the fetal liver experiments and the dexamethasone effect
was blocked by progesterone (Table VII).
Human bone marrow erythroid colony formation was
also increased in the presence of dexamethasone (10'
M) (Table VIII). The degree of augmentation at maxi￾mal stimulating levels of erythropoietin was comparable
to the results obtained with murine tissues.
DISCUSSION
Although the 5,8-H steroids are known stimulators of
red cell production (4, 17), the relationship of gluco￾corticosteroids to erythropoiesis is uncertain. Addison's
disease in man is associated with normocytic, normo￾chromic anemia (18), and a congenital erythroid hy￾TABLE VIII

poplasia of children (Diamond-Blackfan syndrome) is
frequently responsive to low doses of glucocorticoids
(19). In animals, glucocorticosteroids and ACTH have
been reported to stimulate erythropoiesis (20-22) but
inhibition has also been observed (23, 24) On the basis.
of observations in nephrectomized rats, Malgor and co￾workers (22) concluded that dexamethasone stimulated
erythropoiesis by an effect on erythropoietin production.
Glucocorticoids are also reported to stimulate erythro￾poiesis in amphibians (25). Cortisone has been found
inhibitory to granulopoiesis both in vivo and in vitro
(26).
Mouse fetal liver is a rich source of erythropoietin￾responsive cells (27) and has been used in assays for
erythropoietin (28). We used a cloning assay employ￾ing fetal liver cells in order to assess the effect of
dexamethasone on mammalian erythropoiesis in vitro.
Erythroid colonies formed in vitro without the addi￾tion of exogenous erythropoietin. Since these colonies
did not form when an antibody to erythropoietin was in￾cluded in the culture plate, we assumed that these col￾onies were generated in response to endogenous erythro￾poietin produced by the fetal liver cells (12-14) or per￾haps in part to erythropoietin in the fetal calf serum.
Exogenous erythropoietin markedly stimulated colony
formation in vitro, and peak activity was observed at a
concentration of 0.5 U/ml sheep erythropoietin. Higher
doses of sheep erythropoietin yielded fewer colonies and
this may have been due to toxic impurities in the erythro￾poietin preparation (7).
Dexamethasone produced a marked augmentation of
colony formation in vitro. The dexamethasone-induced
increased cloning was most prominent at suboptimal
levels of erythropoietin. It seems likely that the dexa￾methasone effect was mediated via a glucocorticosteroid
receptor mechanism in the erythropoietin-responsive
cells. Only a brief exposure to steroid was required to
exhibit the stimulatory effect and the dexamethasone
stimulation was ablated by appropriate concentrations

of progesterone. Progesterone is known to block glu￾cocorticoid activity by interfering with glucocorticoid
receptor binding and function (15, 16). Also, dexa￾methasone did not increase colony formation in the
presence of antierythropoietin antibody.
Erythropoietin is thought to act via a specific recep￾tor mechanism on certain red cell progenitors (2, 27).
The present studies suggest that these cells may also
have a glucocorticoid receptor mechanism. The addi￾tion of dexamethasone appears to increase the sensitivity
and response to erythropoietin in vitro and does so
maximally in concentrations equivalent to physiologic
levels of hydrocortisone. The comparable response of
adult mouse and human marrow erythroid progenitors
to dexamethasone implies that the phenomenon is not
peculiar to fetal cells and is not dependent on the pres￾ence of fetal hepatocytes in the culture plates. One pos￾sible explanation for these observations is that there is
an interaction between the postulated receptor mecha￾nism for glucocorticosteroid and erythropoietin on red
cell progenitors. Glucocorticosteroid modulation of the
interaction between hormones and their receptor mecha￾nisms has been described in several systems. Recently,
glucocorticoids were shown to modulate the sensitivity
of the rat testicular Leydig cell to chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) (29). Gospodarowicz demonstrated a permissive
effect of glucocorticoid on the stimulation of 3T3 cells
by fibroblast growth factor (30). Progesterone was in￾hibitory in the 3T3 system as well.
Since concentrations of dexamethasone higher than
those equivalent to physiologic concentrations of hydro￾cortisone did not augment erythropoiesis, there is little
in these in vitro experiments to suggest that glucocorti￾coids would be of use as a "general" stimulus to erythro￾poiesis. On the other hand, diseases involving alterations
in the function or interaction of these postulated recep￾tor mechanisms might be affected by exogenous gluco￾corticosteroid.
