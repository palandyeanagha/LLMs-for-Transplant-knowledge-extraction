A B S T R A C T Certain aminothiols rapidly deplete cul￾tured cystinotic skin fibroblasts of their abnormally
high free (nonprotein) cystine pool. The free cystine
content of these cells is reduced by over 90% in 1 h with
0.1 mM cysteamine. This is more rapid than previously
known methods of removing free cystine from cystinotic
fibroblasts. The disulfide, cystamine, is also able to
deplete cystinotic cells of free cystine.
A patient with nephropathic cystinosis and end-stage
renal disease was treated with cysteamine, both intra￾venously and orally. Both methods of administration
rapidly lowered the free cystine content of the patient's
peripheral leukocytes.
Study of the patient's urinary sulfur excretion did not
conclusively determine the effect of this therapy on the
total body cystine pool. Her renal status remained at
end stage after 1 mo of oral cysteamine, when an epi￾sode of grand mal seizures prompted cessation of the
study. Determination of the proper place of aminothiol
therapy in this disease will depend upon further clinical
trial with patients whose kidney function has not deteri￾orated to the point of irreversible change, accompanied
by careful monitoring of plasma aminothiol levels.

mission, free (nonprotein) cystine accumulation within
lysosomes, renal tubular dysfunction, and progressive
glomerular insufficiency leading to end-stage renal failure
in the first decade of life. In spite of extensive investi￾gations (1, 2), the primary defect leading to cystine ac￾cumulation and renal failure is unknown.
The accumulation of free cystine in fibroblasts cul￾tured from cystinotic patients has provided a convenient
in vitro test system for the evaluation of methods of
lowering the intracellular nonprotein cystine content of
these cells. Effective methods include growth in a low￾cystine medium (3), treatment with dithiothreitol
(DTT)' (4, 5), and treatment with ascorbic acid (6).
None of these methods has been proved effective clini￾cally, although DTT treatment has been shown to lower
the leukocyte nonprotein cystine content in vivo (7).
This report shows the effectiveness of certain amino￾thiols in producing a rapid and complete depletion of
nonprotein cystine from cystinotic fibroblasts without
producing apparent morphological signs of cytotoxicity.
The cystine released is utilized by the cell for GSH syn￾thesis. A series of structural analogues of the aminothiol,
cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol), have been investigated
and allow some tentative conclusions on the relative ef￾fectiveness of these compounds in depleting cystine from
cystinotic fibroblasts. A mechanism is proposed as to
how these compounds produce cystine depletion without
themselves accumulating.
A patient with nephropathic cystinosis and end-stage
renal failure was treated with cysteamine, both intra￾venously and orally. Both modes of administration pro￾duced marked lowering of the peripheral leukocyte non￾protein cystine content. Renal function remained un￾changed during a 2-mo treatment.

METHODS
Cell culture and biochemistry. Skin fibroblasts from
patients with nephropathic cystinosis and normal individuals
were established in culture and maintained as previously
described (8, 9). 7-9 X 0I cells were plated in 100-mm
Falcon Petri dishes (Falcon Plastics, Div. of BioQuest,
Oxnard, Calif.) and harvested 72 h later while in log￾phase growth. A modified Ham's F12 medium was used
for complete (cystine-containing) medium (8). Cystine-de￾ficient medium was the same medium with cystine omitted.
Both were supplemented with 10%o fetal bovine serum.
When used to supplement the cystine-deficient medium, the
fetal bovine serum was dialyzed.
Unradiolabeled cells were harvested by trypsinization (8)
after being washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline
(10) at 4°C. Cell number was determined with a Coulter
Counter, model ZBI (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah,
Fla.). Protein was determined colorimetrically (11) with
bovine serum albumin as the standard. The intracellular
nonprotein cystine content of fibroblasts and leukocytes was
measured by a cystine-binding protein assay (8). L-['S]-
Cystine (sp act 395 mCi/mmol and 23.2 Ci/mmol) was
obtained from Amersham/Searle Corp. (Arlington Heights,
Ill.) and New England Nuclear (Boston, Mass.), respec￾tively. Purity of labeled cystine was greater than 98% when
tested by high-voltage electrophoresis, followed by radio￾chromatogram scan (see below). Cysteamine and its ana￾logues were the best available grade (over 97% purity)
and obtained from either Calbiochem (San Diego, Calif.)
or Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (Milwaukee, Wis.). Omni￾fluor was purchased from New England Nuclear.
In studies with labeled material, Petri dishes of fibro￾blasts in log-phase growth were washed four times in
phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C and harvested by direct
freezing of the cells in the culture dish on a dry ice-ethanol
bath in the presence of 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)
in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The cells
were then thawed briefly at 60°C and detached from the
surface with a rubber scraper at 25°C. The initial cell lysate,
plus a 2-ml H20 wash, were combined and lyophilized. The
residue was dissolved in 400 ,ul of 3% sulfosalicylic acid,
and the acid-soluble fraction was analyzed by high-voltage
electrophoresis on paper.
High-voltage electrophoresis on paper was performed on
a Camag high-voltage electrophoresis system (Camag Inc.,
New Berlin, Wis.). Known standards included taurine, cys￾teic acid, GSH-NEM, cysteine-NEM, cystine, methionine,
cysteamine-NEM, the mixed disulfide of cysteamine and
cysteine, and cystamine. These standards were added to the
samples, and the mixtures were run in 6% formic acid
buffer, pH 1.7, at 97 V/cm. The paper was dried, and the
spots were identified with ninhydrin (12). The areas of
radioactivity were localized with a Packard radiochromato￾gram scanner, model 7201 (Packard Instrument Co., Inc.,
Downers Grove, Ill.), and quantitated by cutting out the
positive areas and counting in Omnifluor, 4 g/liter of tolu￾ene, in a Beckman liquid scintillation system (Beckman In￾struments, Inc., Fullerton, Calif.). Counting efficiency for
'S was 98%.
Granule-rich fractions from cystinotic fibroblasts were
prepared by disruption of cells by sonication in 0.25 M
sucrose. The nuclei and membrane fragments were removed
by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min, and the granular
fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 27,000 g for 30
min with resuspension in 0.25 M sucrose in 10 mM potas￾sium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (13). To determine the
cystine depletion effect of various compounds on cystinotic
granules, portions of the granule suspension were added
to tubes containing the test reagents and incubated at 25°C
for 30 min. Granules from 100 ,ul of the incubation mixture
were recovered by centrifugation at 27,000 g for 20 min,
sonicated in the presence of 5 mM NEM in 10 mM po￾tassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and precipitated with 3%o
sulfosalicylic acid. Cystine was measured with a cystine￾binding protein assay (8). Urinary sulfur and sulfate were
determined as previously described (14). Urinary and
plasma amino acids were determined with a Durrum 500
amino acid analyzer (Durrum Instrument Corp., Palo Alto,
Calif.) (15).
Case report. A 7-yr-old white girl with nephropathic cys￾tinosis was the fourth affected of seven siblings in this
family. Three older sibs have died of renal failure due to
cystinosis. Renal transplantation was refused by the parents,
and a trial of cysteamine was therefore offered. Food and
Drug Administration approval and informed consent were
obtained before the drug trial.
The patient was a small, pale child with a weight of
17.6 kg (<3 percentile) and height of 107 cm (<3 per￾centile). Slight frontal bossing and uremic breath were
the only other positive physical findings. Her pulse was
85, her respiration 16, and her blood pressure 114/74.
Initial laboratory values included a blood urea nitrogen
of 145 mg/100 ml, serum creatinine of 6.5 mg/100 ml, crea￾tinine clearance of 8.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2, calcium of 9.9
mg/100 ml, phosphorus of 11.6 mg/100 ml, white blood cell
count of 5,600/mm3, reticulocytes of 1.1%o, hemoglobin 6.7
mg/100 ml, and a hematocrit of 20. Serum electrolytes, liver
functions, white blood cell differential, and platelet count
were within normal limits. Long-bone X-rays demonstrated
minimal changes of renal osteodystrophy. Ophthalmological
examination showed the typical keratopathy and retinopathy
of cystinosis (16). During the study period, the patient was
maintained on her previous regimen of oral aluminum hy￾droxide (Amphojel, Wyeth Laboratories, Div., American
Home Products Corp., Philadelphia, Pa.), sodium and po￾tassium citrate solution, vitamin D, (dihydrotachysterol)
0.1 mg/day, and vitamin C, 3 g/day.
Cysteamine for intravenous use was sterilized, lyophilized
(17), tested for sterility and pyrogens, and stored at - 20°C.
It was dissolved in sterile, normal saline immediately before
administration and injected over a 5-min period. Cysteamine
for oral administration was prepared in gelatin capsules
and stored at room temperature in sealed jars containing
dessicant. After 3 wk of storage, the compound was reacted
with NEM and studied by high-voltage electrophoresis as
decribed above; cysteamine-NEM was the only ninhydrin￾reactive spot.
RESULTS
Fibroblasts. The rate of depletion of free cystine from
cystinotic fibroblasts by cysteamine and the effect of
concentration are shown in Fig. 1. 90% of the original
intracellular nonprotein cystine content is depleted in 1
h by both 1 mM and 0.1 mM cysteamine. 50% of the
cystine depletion occurs in the first 15 min after addition
of 0.1 mM cysteamine to the culture medium. The rate
of depletion caused by cysteamine compared to DTT,
cystamine, and penicillamine is shown in Fig. 2. The
values for DTT agree with previous studies (4, 5). At
a concentration of 1 mM, cystamine, the disulfide of

cysteamine, is equally as effective as cysteamine in
producing intracellular nonprotein cystine depletion from
cystinotic fibroblasts. However, penicillamine (D-3-mer￾captovaline) produces no appreciable free cystine de￾pletion under these conditions.
Table I lists analogues of cysteamine and their effect
on the intracellular nonprotein cystine content of cys￾tinotic cells, along with the effect of selected compounds
on L-cystine in a simple cell-free chemical reaction. The
dimethyl derivative, 2-dimethylaminoethanethiol, is ap￾proximately as effective as cysteamine in producing in￾tracellular nonprotein cystine depletion at 1 mM con￾centration. At these concentrations and reaction condi￾tions, sulfhydryl compounds of similar molecular weight
but possessing a hydrogen, hydroxyl, or methyl group
instead of an amine in the two position do not produce
cystine depletion from cystinotic fibroblasts. Both di￾thiols studied produced approximately 50% depletion
at 1 h. Ethanolamine, with a molecular weight similar
to cysteamine but without a sulfhydryl moiety, produced
no cystine depletion either in cells or in the simple chemi￾cal reaction. Cystamine, the disulfide of cysteamine, is
highly effective in producing cystine depletion from
cystinotic fibroblasts but ineffective in lowering the cys￾tine concentration in a cell-free system. The monosul￾fide, bis(2-aminoethyl) sulfide, does not cause cystine
depletion in either system.
The effect of 1 mM cysteamine in cystine-deficient
medium on cystinotic and normal fibroblasts prelabeled
for 18 h with L-[IIS]cystine is shown in Table II. A
rapid drop of labeled cystine to undetectable levels oc￾curs in the cystinotic cells, as expected from the previ￾ous experiments. The EM5S] in the cysteine pool is de￾pleted to about 50% of control levels in both normal
and cystinotic fibroblasts, and the amount of label in
GSH falls in the normal but rises slightly in the cysti￾notic cells. The rise in labeled GSH could have been
due to incorporation of labeled cysteine resulting from
reduction of some labeled cystine released by the action
of cysteamine, but the large pool of GSH would have
obscured this finding. Therefore, experiments using cells
depleted of GSH were undertaken.
GSH levels in both normal and cystinotic fibroblasts
can be lowered to less than 10% of control by incuba￾tion in cystine-deficient medium for 20-24 h (18). Ta￾ble III shows the effect of cysteamine and cystamine on
cystinotic fibroblasts placed in a cystine-deficient medium
for 22 h. In Table IIIA, cystinotic cells labeled with
L-[MS]cystine for 22 h have been depleted of GSH by
subsequent incubation in a cystine-deficient medium for
22 h, and show about 10% of the total [TMS] label com￾pared to those in the preceding experiments, due to loss
of label during the cystine-deficient incubation. Treat￾ment of these cells for 1 h with cysteamine produces a
94% loss in label recovered as cystine, a threefold in￾crease in label recovered as glutathione, and a twofold
increase in label- recovered as cysteine. These results
are unchanged if the overlying medium is replaced dur￾ing the 1-h cysteamine incubation or if the medium vol￾130 . a

ume is tripled. Treatment of these cells with cystamine
produces only a 35% decline in label recovered as cys￾tine, with no change in amount of label recovered as
GSH and a threefold increase in label recovered as
cysteine.
The discrepency between the amount of free cystine
depletion produced by cysteamine and the cystamine in
GSH-depleted fibroblasts is shown further with unlabeled
cells in Table IIIB. 1 mM cysteamine produces more
than 90% depletion of intracellular nonprotein cystine in
1 h, but the same concentration of cystamine produces
only 60% depletion in the same time. In cells not de￾pleted of GSH, identical cystine depletion is produced
by cysteamine and cystamine (Fig. 2 and Table I).
The effect of 1 mM cysteamine, cystamine, and GSH
on the free cystine content of the granular fraction iso￾lated from cystinotic fibroblasts is shown in Table IV.
Cysteamine rapidly depletes the free cystine from these
granules, but neither GSH nor cystamine do.
When cystamine is added to fibroblasts maintained in
tissue culture, significant decreases occur in growth
rates and cloning efficiency (Tables V and VI). At
concentrations of cysteamine over 1 mM, cultures are
found to be nonviable after approximately 72 h.

were discontinued after 1 wk, and cysteamine was not
reinstituted. Seizures have not recurred.
DISCUSSION
Previous interest in cysteamine has centered around its
radioprotective effect and the potential physiological
significance of its position as the S-terminal moiety of
coenzyme A. Cysteamine is one of the most radiopro￾tective compounds known (19). The protection is
thought to result from scavenging of free radicals, either
directly or via release of protein-bound GSH (19). An

from cystinotic fibroblasts produced by cysteamine. Cystea￾mine (mol wt 77) enters the lysosomal pool (see text) and
reacts with cystine (mol wt 240) to form cysteine (mol
wt 120) and the mixed disulfide of cysteamine and cysteine
(mol wt 196). Further reaction between cysteamine and
the mixed disulfide leads to formation of cysteine and the
disulfide, cystamine (mol w,t 152). All reaction products
have mol wt of less than 200 daltons, and thus should freely
diffuse from the lysosome. Cystamine is reduced to cystea￾mine in the cytoplasm by reaction with GSH (see Table
IV). Cysteine enters normal biosynthetic pathways (Table
IIIA).

leukocytes after oral and intravenous administration

cystine depletion shows that cysteamine is more rapidly
effective than DTT, ascorbic acid (6), or growth in a
low-cystine medium (3). Cytopathic changes were not
noted during the course of cystine depletion by cystea￾mine and cystamine, though significant reductions in
growth rate and cloning efficiency occur in cells main￾tained in cystamine over longer periods of time (Tables

Table IIIA, indicates that the cystine released by this
treatment can be utilized by the cell for GSH synthesis.
This apparently occurs primarily within the cell, as the
results are unaffected when the overlying medium is
changed during the incubation or when the medium vol￾ume is increased.
Structural analogues of aminothiols lacking the amine
moiety produce little or no free cystine depletion from
cystinotic cells. Optimal depletion is produced by un￾substituted iaminothiols, with primary and tertiary
amines appearing equally effective. All of the sulfhydryl
compounds tested in Table I are capable of reducing
cystine in a cell-free chemical reaction; however, only
relatively simple aminothiols produce marked intracel￾lular nonprotein cystine depletion from cystinotic fibro￾blasts. Passage through two membranes (plasma and
lysosomal) to reach the site of cystine storage may be
critical in determining which compounds can deplete
cystinotic fibroblasts of cystine, and this passage may be
facilitated by the presence of the amine group.
Penicillamine is ineffective in removing intracellular
free cystine under these conditions, reflecting its clini￾cal ineffectiveness in patients with cystinosis (23).
However, it is highly effective in removing the extracel￾lular cystine accumulation (renal stones) in the unre￾lated disease, cystinuria (24).
Cystamine, a disulfide, would not be expected to react
with the disulfide, cystine, unless cystamine were first
reduced to the sulfhydryl form, cysteamine. Evidence for
this reduction occurs in tissue slices (25) and in intact
animals (26). The reaction probably is mediated in the
cytosol by glutathione (27), either as a simple chemical
reaction or via glutathione reductase (28), and has been
shown within mitochondria to result from reaction with
reduced lipoic acid generated by the lipoamide dehy￾drogenase system (29). Inferential evidence that this
occurs in fibroblasts is presented in Tables I, III, and IV,
In intact cystinotic fibroblasts with normal intracellular
GSH levels (30), cystamine and cysteamine are equally
effective in producing intracellular nonprotein cystine
depletion. In fibroblasts depleted of GSH, the major
source of intracellular reductant (27), however, the
ability of cystamine to lower the cystine concentration is
decreased compared to cysteamine, which is unaffected.
Furthermore, in systems lacking a soluble source of re￾ducing power, i.e. isolated granules prepared by soni￾cation and separated from the GSH-containing cytosol
by centrifugation and resuspension in 0.25 M sucrose
(see Methods) and cystine in simple solution, cystamine
does not lower the cystine concentration, while cystea￾mine continues to do so.' The monosulfide, bis(2-amino-
'Preliminary studies utilizing 'S-labeled cystamine and
cysteamine have demonstrated intracellular reduction of
cystamine to cysteamine in both normal and cystinotic
ethyl) sulfide, which cannot undergo disulfide exchange
or simple disulfide reduction, is ineffective in lowering
the cystine concentration both in solution and in fibro￾blasts. Its structural similarity to cystamine lends fur￾ther support to the necessity for cystamine to undergo
disulfide reduction before producing cystine depletion.
Diffusion through lysosomal membranes is restricted
to molecules of molecular weight less than 200-230 dal￾tons (31). Cystine accumulation in cystinotic lysosomes
has been suggested to result in part from its relatively
large molecular weight (mol wt 240.3) (32). Cysteamine
(mol wt 77.15), cysteine (mol wt 121.16), cystamine
(mol wt 152.29), and the mixed disulfide of cysteine and
cysteamine (mol wt 196.3) should all diffuse freely
across such membranes.
In Fig. 5 a model is proposed that accounts for the
observed depletion of cystine from cystinotic fibroblasts
produced by cysteamine and cystamine. In this model,
cysteamine enters the lysosome, perhaps facilitated by
the amine group, and reacts with cystine, producing one
molecule of mixed disulfide and one molecule of cysteine.
Reaction of the mixed disulfide with cysteamine pro￾duces another molecule of cysteine and one molecule of
cystamine. The cysteine can diffuse into the cytoplasm
and be incorporated into GSH (Table III), while the
cystamine so produced can be reduced back to cystea￾mine, as discussed above. As all reaction products have
molecular weights under 200, no net accumulation of any
of these compounds should occur within the lysosome to
replace the depleted cystine.
The objectives of this initial clinical study were:
(a) to determine whether cysteamine produces cystine
depletion from cystinotic tissues in vivo and, if so, the
effective dose, (b) to define side effects of this drug, and
(c) to ascertain if improvement or stabilization of renal
function could result from this treatment. The clinical
trial was undertaken with the expectation that improve￾ment of renal function was unlikely in a patient who
already had end-stage renal failure. Although renal
function was unchanged during the course of treatment,
the study was terminated before any conclusion could
be reached on the effect of cysteamine therapy on this
parameter.
It is impossible to use renal cystine content as an in￾dex of cystine depletion because of the difficulty in ob￾taining multiple samples and because cystine is not uni￾formly distributed throughout this organ (33). There￾fore, leukocytes were chosen as a readily accessible
source of cystinotic tissue. Our data shows that cystea￾mine causes rapid cystine depletion from this tissue
in vivo.

Aminothiol Treatment of Cystinosis 187

The patient's total urinary sulfur excretion increased
roughly in proportion to the increases in oral cysteamine
dose (Table VIII). Although the taurine excretion in￾creased from 0.02 to 0.37 mmol/day, this represents
only a minute fraction of the urinary sulfate. The sul￾fate excretion remained relatively stable during this
study. Thus neutral sulfur accounted for the bulk of the
increase seen in total sulfur excretion. It is possible
that the increase in neutral sulfur excretion was composed
of cysteamine and its mixed disulfide with cysteine.
Unfortunately, we are not yet able to identify and quan￾titate these compounds in physiological samples.
The metabolic fate of cysteamine has been studied in
both experimental animals and man with conflicting re￾sults. After intravenous administration to dogs, 30% of
the cysteamine was excreted unchanged in the urine
(26). Oral administration of cysteamine to one adult
human volunteer resulted in only 1% of the drug ap￾pearing unchanged in the urine (34). The urinary cys￾tine excretion fell from 0.28 to 0.08 mmol/day during
this study. It is possible that this was due to a fall in
plasma cystine concentration resulting from formation of
the cysteamine-cysteine mixed disulfide in plasma. A
similar reaction occurs in cystinuric patients treated
with D-penicillamine. In these patients the plasma and
urinary cystine concentration decreases as the mixed
disulfide of penicillamine and cysteine appears (35).
Difficulty in enforcing stringent dietary regulations in
an anorectic child and lack of quantitation of fecal sul￾fur excretion precluded a more formal balance study in
our patient.
It is also possible that significant amounts of cystine
labilized by the action of cysteamine were utilized for
GSH (Table III) or protein synthesis. Such a mecha￾nism would not necessarily lead to an increase in sulfur
excretion.
During this study adverse side effects were not ob￾served in liver functions, hematological indices, or elec￾trolyte balance. An episode of seizures caused us to
terminate the study. Seizures have occurred in animals
treated with high doses of cysteamine intravenously
(36) and may be analogous to the seizures produced by
pryidoxine depletion resulting from treatment with peni￾cillamine (37) or depletion of gamma-aminobutyric acid
levels, as has been demonstrated in rats treated with
high doses of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (38).
In a patient with impaired renal function blood cystea￾mine levels may have risen progressively during treat￾ment, and development of a clinically applicable method
for measurement of blood levels of cysteamine, cysta￾mine, and the mixed disulfide of cysteamine and cysteine
would assist further clinical investigation of this com￾pound. Because of this patient's advanced stage of re￾nal disease, improvement in renal function was not ex￾pected. Further clinical trials in cystinotic patients with
better renal function are warranted if accompanied by
careful monitoring of plasma drug concentrations.
