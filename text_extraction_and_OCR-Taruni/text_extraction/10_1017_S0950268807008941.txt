SUMMARY
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is ubiquitous in pigs worldwide and may be zoonotic. Previous HEV
seroprevalence estimates for groups of people working with swine were higher than for control
groups. However, discordance among results of anti-HEV assays means that true seroprevalence
estimates, i.e. seroprevalence due to previous exposure to HEV, depends on choice of seroassay.
We tested blood samples from three subpopulations (49 swine veterinarians, 153 non-swine
veterinarians and 644 randomly selected individuals from the general population) with one IgM
and two IgG ELISAs, and subsets with IgG and/or IgM Western blots. A Bayesian stochastical
model was used to combine results of all assays. The model accounted for imperfection of each
assay by estimating sensitivity and specificity, and accounted for dependence between serological
assays. As expected, discordance among assay results occurred. Applying the model yielded
seroprevalence estimates of y11% for swine veterinarians, y6% for non-swine veterinarians
and y2% for the general population. By combining the results of five serological assays in
a Bayesian stochastical model we confirmed that exposure to swine or their environment was
associated with elevated HEV seroprevalence.
INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enterically transmitted
RNA virus discovered in the early 1980s [1]. Since
then, the virus has caused major outbreaks of
hepatitis E as well as sporadic cases in humans in
developing countries. A common source in epidemics
is often contaminated water [2]. Mortality rates are
around 1% in general [2], but may reach up to about
25% in pregnant women [3]. In addition, pre-term
deliveries occur in an estimated two-thirds of HEV￾infected pregnant women [3].
In developed countries, studies show seropreva￾lence between 0.
9% and 2.
6%, suggesting cases of

hepatitis E occur [4]. Such cases are considered to
be imported from HEV endemic areas, mainly Asia
and Africa [2]. However, reports on locally acquired
hepatitis E in developed countries are increasing
and local sources of the virus have been identified.
For instance, foodborne transmission of HEV
was described in Japan, where consumption of
undercooked game meat and pig livers led to clini￾cal disease in humans [5–7]. However, no source
has yet been documented for any reported locally
acquired case in Europe and the United States
[8–11].
Possible zoonotic transmission from domestic
swine to humans was suggested after the dis￾covery of porcine HEV that showed extensive simi￾larity to human HEV strains [12]. The possibility
of inter-species transmission of HEV was corro￾borated by experimental infection of pigs with a
human HEV strain and subsequent HEV trans￾mission to a contact pig, and by infection of pri￾mates with porcine HEV [13]. Furthermore, direct
contact with swine was suggested to be a risk factor
for veterinarians and swine farm-workers due to
a higher seroprevalence compared to control indi￾viduals [14–17].
Several serological assays to detect HEV antigens
in humans have been developed, but discordance
among test results occurs when different assays are
applied to the same samples [18, 19]. This makes
interpretation of results difficult, especially when
assays are applied to cross-sectional samples from
populations and most positive results are probably
from historic cases of hepatitis E. Knowing sensi￾tivity and specificity of assays allows correction for
misclassified results, but no gold standard is avail￾able to assess these two parameters. Several statisti￾cal methods are available to account for imperfect
diagnostic testing in true seroprevalence estimation
in the absence of a gold standard [20]. One such
method estimates sensitivity and specificity of two
diagnostic assays using maximum likelihood, for
instance applicable for two assays used in two
populations with different true seroprevalence (i.e.
seroprevalence due to previous exposure to HEV)
[21]. However, this method, requires use of large
sample sizes and assumes conditional independence
between assays, which limits its use. A statistical
approach based on Bayes’ theorem is able to deal
with conditional dependence between assays and does
not require large sample sizes [22]. An additional
advantage of a Bayesian approach is inclusion of
scientific knowledge in a probabilistic sense (desig￾nated priors).
The objective of this study was to estimate
true HEV seroprevalence in three populations with
differing exposure to swine, while accounting for
imperfect diagnostic testing. We analysed serum
samples from swine veterinarians, non-swine veter￾inarians and the general population with five sero￾logical assays. Subsequently, assay results were
analysed with a Bayesian stochastical model that
estimated sensitivity and specificity of each assay
and accounted for potential dependency between
assays.
METHODS
Serum samples and study populations
Blood samples were collected and processed as
described previously [23]. Briefly, 202 samples from
veterinarians were used and a total of 648 samples
from the general population were matched by gender,
age and geography. Serum samples had been stored
at x70 xC for about 2 years. Information from each
veterinarian was obtained by questionnaire. Two
questions addressed the relative distribution of time
working with finishing and with farrowing pigs,
divided in five categories: 0%, >0–25%, >25–50%,
>50–75%, and >75%. Based on the estimated total
time working with finishing and farrowing pigs
(for quartiles, median values of categories were used
for summation), veterinarians were considered swine
veterinarian if >50% of their time was devoted to
pigs (n=49) or non-swine veterinarians (n=153) if
otherwise. Individuals from the general population
were assumed to have had no professional exposure
to swine.
Diagnostic assays
Five serological assays were used in this study: two
ELISAs to detect IgG (E-1, Abbott Laboratories,
Abbott Park, IL, USA; and E-2, Genelabs Diag￾nostics Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA), one ELISA
to detect IgM (E-3, Genelabs Diagnostics), one
Western blot to detect IgG (WB-1; Mikrogen,
Martinsried, Germany) and one Western blot to
detect IgM (WB-2; Mikrogen).
All serum samples were examined with E-1, E-2
and E-3. All but two samples that were positive in
at least one ELISA (63 positive samples) and two

samples of which results were uncertain were blindly
examined with WB-1 at the Medical University
Graz in Austria (Fig. 1). Among these 63 samples six
were from swine veterinarians, 15 from non-swine
veterinarians and 42 from individuals from the
general population. In addition, 200 samples were
examined with WB-1 and WB-2 at the National
Institute for Public Health and the Environment in
The Netherlands. Among these 200 samples 47 were
from swine-veterinarians, 88 from randomly selected
non-swine veterinarians and 65 from randomly selec￾ted individuals from the general population. In total,
48 swine veterinarians, 94 non-swine veterinarians
and 102 samples from the general population were
examined with WB-1.
Ratios in optical density (OD) for E-1, E-2 and E-3,
and scores for WB-1 and WB-2 were calculated
according to the instructions supplied by the manu￾facturers. Samples with an OD ratio >1 in E-2 and
E-3 or an OD ratio >0.
9 in E-1 were retested in
duplicate. Samples were defined as positive if the
average OD ratio of the duplicate test was >1 for all
ELISAs. For WB-1 and WB-2, samples were defined
as positive when the score was >3 (WB-1) and >5
(WB-2), as prescribed by the manufacturer.
Agreement between assays was quantified with the
kappa statistic [24].
Bayesian analysis
The Bayesian model that was applied in this study
has two possible approaches for estimating sensitivity,
specificity and true seroprevalence [25]. Of these two,
the representation based on product conditional dis￾tributions was able to handle missing data and was
therefore used. The described representation was
extended to consider five diagnostic assays and three
subpopulations. The model uses latent classes, which
describe unknown distributions of true presence
(D=1) or absence (D=0) of anti-HEV antibodies in
serum samples. True presence or absence was as￾sumed to be independently distributed with true sero￾prevalence pm=P(D=1|group m) among individuals
sampled from subpopulation m. Hence, assay results
follow a mixture of distributions for true positives
and true negatives, with true seroprevalence as mix￾ture probabilities. The Bayesian analysis was per￾formed using the Gibbs sampler, as implemented in
WinBUGS (the script can be obtained from the
corresponding author) [26]. Sensitivity and specificity
of each assay was assumed to be equal across sub￾populations.
In Bayesian analyses, a priori information in a
probabilistic sense (designated prior) is required for
each parameter. Priors for sensitivity and specificity
of each assay were based on the literature [19]. For
assays based on similar antigens as E-2, sensitivity
between 67% and 91% was observed. We specified a
prior with a median of 50% [95% credible interval
(CI) 15–98]. This prior was also used to describe
specificity of all assays. Sensitivity of E-1 was con￾sidered to be lower than for E-2 based on experience,
for which we specified a prior with a median of 25%
(95% CI 6–66). The default prior for true seropreva￾lence was based on data for reported seroprevalence
in industrialized countries and had a median of 12%
(95% CI 0.
5–51). Influence of all priors on final
estimates was examined by substitution of initial
priors with non-informative priors. To assess the
influence of the prior for true seroprevalence, it was
replaced with a less conservative prior with median
25% (95% CI 3–66) and a more conservative prior
with median 7% (95% CI 0.
3–31).
Differences between true seroprevalence esti￾mates for the three subpopulations were estimated
simultaneously with true seroprevalence. Statistical
differences between populations were assumed to be
present if zero was excluded from the 95% CI of
the difference.

RESULTS
Descriptive
Characteristics of swine veterinarians and non-swine
veterinarians are shown in Table 1. Swine veterinar￾ians were over-represented in the south of The
Netherlands (x2
, P<0.
01), which reflects the concen￾tration of swine farms in that region. Otherwise, no
significant differences between swine veterinarians
and non-swine veterinarians were observed.
Percentages of HEV positivity in each subpopu￾lation are illustrated per assay in Figure 2. Large
differences were observed in assay outcomes (see also
Table 2). Quantifying the agreement between assays
yielded ‘moderate’ (E-1 compared to E-2: kappa
y0.

Recently, a strategy of using combined assay
results for HEV to obtain acceptable sensitivity
and specificity in low-endemic areas was proposed by
M. Herremans et al. (unpublished observations).
In this regime, positive results with E-2 are confirmed
by WB-1. Using this regime on the 200 samples that
were examined with WB-1 in The Netherlands yielded
seroprevalence estimates of 6.
4% for the general
population, 2.
3% for non-swine veterinarians and
8.
5% for swine veterinarians.
Seroprevalence estimation
In all simulations, results from the first 4000 iterations
were discarded for burn-in. Different chain lengths
(50 000–2 500 000) as well as replicate chains of equal
length (50 000 and 100 000) and three parallel chains
with different initial values for all parameters (chain
length 50 000) were compared with respect to the
stability of posterior estimates. Posterior estimates
were consistent in all comparisons. The results re￾ported in this paper were obtained by one simulation
with 100 000 iterations.
Estimated sensitivity of assays varied between
10% and 63%, with wide credible intervals (Table 3).
Estimated specificity of assays varied between 74%
and 99%, with small credible intervals. Changing
the prior for specificity affected these results mini￾mally. Changing the prior for sensitivity affected the
sensitivity estimate for E-1 most and had marginal
effects on the sensitivity of other assays.

population are shown in Table 4. The highest true
seroprevalence was estimated for swine veterin￾arians (y11%), lowest true seroprevalence for the
general population (y2%), and intermediate true
seroprevalence for non-swine veterinarians (y6%).
The true seroprevalence among swine veterinarians
was significantly higher than among the general
population, with the 95% CI of the median of
the difference (0.
1–24) excluding zero. The true
seroprevalence among non-swine veterinarians
was not significantly different from the true sero￾prevalence among swine veterinarians or among the
general population, but a dose–response relation
was suggested. Changing priors for sensitivity or
specificity altered the true prevalence estimates to
the minimum.
Changing the prior for seroprevalence altered
seroprevalence estimates for all groups (Table 5).
The difference in true seroprevalence between
swine veterinarians and the general population was
13% (95% CI 1.
6–40) with use of the less conser￾vative prior and 7% (95% CI 0.
1–20) with use of
the more conservative prior. Hence, the statistical
difference between swine veterinarians and the
general population remained. When substituting the
less conservative seroprevalence prior for the default
seroprevalence prior, assay sensitivity was estimated
to be lower. When substituting the more conservative
seroprevalence prior for the default seroprevalence
prior, assay sensitivity was estimated to be higher.
Estimated specificity of assays remained stable with
each of the three seroprevalence priors.

DISCUSSION
The significant difference in estimated seroprevalence
between swine veterinarians (y11%) and the general
population (y2%) suggests a positive correlation
between direct contact with swine, or swine farms,
and seropositivity for anti-HEV antigens in humans.
Our results agree with those from a US study that
found 26% HEV seroprevalence for swine veterinar￾ians compared to 18% for control subjects [16].
A similar association was observed for swine farm￾workers compared to control subjects in Moldova
(51% compared to 25%), Taiwan (27% compared
to 8%) and the United States (11% compared to
2%) [14, 15, 17]. In contrast, no difference in sero￾prevalence was found between pig farmers and con￾trols in Sweden (13% vs. 9.
3%, respectively) [27].
Differences between seroprevalence estimates for
comparable groups have probably been caused by
differences in country of origin of study populations,
in the study populations themselves, and in serologi￾cal assays used.
All previous studies that relate contact with swine
to HEV seroprevalence examined presence or absence
of swine exposure. We also studied a group of
individuals with less exposure to swine than swine
veterinarians, but more exposure than the general
population. Data tentatively suggest a positive re￾lation between seroprevalence and level of exposure
to swine. However, as this type of study design lacks
the ability for causal inference, other possible sources
of HEV on swine farms cannot be excluded as
a possible explanation for elevated HEV sero￾prevalence. Therefore, the data presented confirm
that exposure to swine or the swine environment is
associated with elevated HEV seroprevalence.
Veterinarians may indeed be exposed to HEV
during treatment of pigs, as HEV RNA was present
on at least 54% of 97 randomly selected finishing pig
farms in The Netherlands in 2005 [28]. However,
other farm animals, such as cattle, sheep and goats,
have also been shown to carry antibodies to the virus,
albeit at a lower seroprevalence than swine, and might
be a source of HEV. The seroprevalence of y6% for
non-swine veterinarians compared to 2% for the
general population, although not significantly differ￾ent, might, next to low-level swine exposure, also be
the result of direct contact with other animal sources
that are susceptible to HEV. Other animals that
may spread HEV though faecal deposits should be

HEV seroprevalence and swine exposure 573

examined in more detail, preferably with molecular
methods.
Discordance between results from serological
assays targeting similar immunoglobulins (IgG or
IgM) against HEV was observed in this study.
This observation has been reported previously [18, 19]
and complicates the interpretation of cross-sectional
HEV seroprevalence estimates based on results
from a single assay. Preferentially, true seropreva￾lence estimates are adjusted for sensitivity and speci￾ficity of assays [24], but true sensitivity and specificity
of assays are always unknown. Relative sensitivity
and specificity of assays may be estimated from
sample sets obtained from humans or animals during
the acute phase of infection, but assay performance
will probably be different when assays are used in a
cross-sectional or cohort study. For instance, levels
of HEV antibodies decay in time, making discrimi￾nation between positive and negative samples more
difficult [29]. Statistical modelling is useful in such
cases to estimate sensitivity and specificity of assays
and subsequently true seroprevalence in the absence
of a gold standard, as was applied in the present
study. Ideally, the approach described in the present
study should always be used to account for mis￾classified samples in a cross-sectional or cohort study.
The estimated seroprevalence of about 2% for
the general population is consistent with most find￾ings from developed countries [4]. Previous estimates
for The Netherlands include: 0.
4% of 1275 blood
donors [30], 0% of 50 blood donors [31] and 3.
6%
of 167 individuals from the general population
(M. Herremans et al., unpublished data). Such
differences in estimates may be explained by mis￾classified results, by different study populations or
differences in serological assays that were used. A
proposed testing regime for low-endemic countries
suggests that positive results from IgG and IgM
ELISAs should be confirmed with an IgG and IgM
Western blot (M. Herremans et al., unpublished
data). However, although the proposed testing regime
may be a simpler alternative to estimate preva￾lence, estimates may be biased as no correction for
sensitivity and specificity is applied. Applying the
proposed regime to the present data showed that
seroprevalence estimates for non-swine veterinarians
and the general population were overestimated,
whereas the seroprevalence estimate of swine veter￾inarians was underestimated. Therefore, an approach
as described in the present paper should always be
followed.
Data from the present study did not reveal a
higher number of medical consultations by swine
veterinarians compared to non-swine veterinarians.
One swine veterinarian did report a history of non￾ABC hepatitis in the past, but results of serological
assays performed on this sample in the present study
were negative. The absence of a higher number of
medical consultations for swine veterinarians may
suggest that most encounters with HEV by veter￾inarians result in subclinical or mild infections.
The initial selection of 63 samples to be analysed
with WB-1 was based on results from E-1, E-2 and
E-3, and such a selection may affect seroprevalence
estimates. However, in a Bayesian analysis, no special
provision is needed for the selection of samples
for WB-1, when all available data are analysed, be￾cause selection does not affect priors or (product
conditional) likelihood. The priors and the kernels of
the likelihood remain the same.
In this study, probabilities of detecting IgM and
IgG were treated as if they were unrelated to the
stage of the disease. However, it is known that IgM
is a marker of acute infection, whereas IgG is a
marker for past infections [32]. Theoretically, in￾clusion of IgM data may subsequently result in an
underestimation of seroprevalence. However, under￾estimation of the presented seroprevalence due to
inclusion of IgM assays was probably minimal, be￾cause sensitivity of IgM assays was low and speci￾ficity of IgG assays was high. To show that
underestimation of the true seroprevalence did not
occur, we repeated the analysis with data from IgG
assays only. Minimal change in true seroprevalences
and no change in conclusions were observed (data
not shown). The advantage of including IgM assays
in this study was to detect recent HEV infections
for which an IgG response was still absent, and to
increase statistical power.
In conclusion, discordance between results from
different serological assays requires analysis of results
from multiple assays to obtain seroprevalence esti￾mates for HEV in industrialized countries. Presented
data suggest an increased risk for swine veterinarians
due to their professional exposure to swine or swine
environments. Non-swine veterinarians, although
not statistically significant, were found to also have
a higher true seroprevalence estimate compared to
the general population, which may be caused by
exposure to swine (environments), albeit at a lower
level than swine veterinarians, or due to other poten￾tial animal sources.
