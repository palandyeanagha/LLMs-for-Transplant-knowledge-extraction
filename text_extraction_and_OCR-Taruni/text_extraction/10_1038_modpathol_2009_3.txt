It has recently been shown that Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and often lethal cutaneous malignancy, frequently
harbors a novel clonally integrated polyomavirus aptly named Merkel cell polyomavirus. We aimed to study the
prevalence of Merkel cell polyomavirus in cases of Merkel cell carcinoma, using specimens from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. In our archives we identified 41 cases of Merkel cell carcinoma (from 29
different patients). Of these, 20 cases were primary cutaneous tumors, 4 were local recurrences, and 17 were
metastases. PCR using two previously published primer sets, LT1 (440 bp amplicon) and LT3 (308 bp amplicon),
as well as a novel primer set MCVPS1 (109 bp amplicon), was performed on all cases. Selected PCR products
were sequenced to confirm amplicon identity. In addition, the MCVPS1 products were digested with BamH1,
yielding an 83 bp product. Amplifiable DNA was recovered in all 41 study cases. The detection rate of Merkel cell
polyomavirus for each of the three primer sets was 22 of 29 patients (76%) for MCVPS1, 12 of 29 (41%) for LT3,
and 8 of 29 (28%) for LT1. The variation between primer set detection rates was largely due to poor DNA quality,
as supported by poor amplification of the higher molecular weight markers in size control ladder products and
the fact that all cases that were positive by LT1 and LT3 were positive by MCVPS1. Our findings provide further
evidence to link Merkel cell polyomavirus with a possible role in the oncogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma. On a
more practical level, our paraffin-optimized primer set may be used as an ancillary test to confirm the diagnosis
of Merkel cell carcinoma in the clinical setting or for screening other rare tumor types for the causative virus,
especially those tumor types that are underrepresented in frozen tissue repositories.

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and often lethal
cutaneous malignancy that was originally described
as ‘trabecular carcinoma of the skin’ in 1972.1
Although the cell of origin was traditionally thought
to be the slow-acting mechanoreceptor Merkel cell
located in the epidermis,2 recent studies have cast
doubt on this assumption.3,4 Histologically, Merkel
cell carcinoma is composed of small- to intermediate￾sized round blue cells that have an oval nucleus and
scant cytoplasm. The cells are typically arranged in
sheets or nests within the dermis, often extending
into the subcutis (Figure 1). Immunohistochemically,
Merkel cell carcinoma typically shows reactivity to
both epithelial and neuroendocrine markers, includ￾ing pan-cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen,
chromogranin, and synaptophysin. Immunostains for
cytokeratin 20 (CK20) usually show a characteristic
‘dot-like’ perinuclear staining pattern.5
Merkel cell carcinoma is most common among
older (480 years) white men and is largely absent in
populations less than 40 years old. Although the
estimated annual incidence of Merkel cell carcino￾ma in the United States is only about 470 cases a
year, there has been a threefold increase of cases
since 1986.6 Interestingly, the incidence of Merkel
cell carcinoma is significantly higher in populations
with organ transplants, lymphoma, and reduced
immunity;7,8 patients with HIV have a relative risk
for the tumor of 13.4 compared with the general
population.9
Merkel cell carcinoma was recently shown to
harbor a novel polyomavirus aptly named the
Merkel cell polyomavirus, in the majority of
cases.10,11 The virus is a nonenveloped, double￾stranded DNA virus with a 5387 bp circular genome
that shares a high degree of homology with African
green monkey polyomavirus viral proteins and
T-cell antigens. In common with other polyoma￾viruses that infect humans (including BK virus, JC Received 7 October 2008; revised and accepted 7 January 2009;

virus, KI virus, and WU virus), Merkel cell poly￾omavirus expresses a large T-cell antigen. However,
unlike the other human polyomaviruses that have
never been associated with neoplastic transforma￾tion of any cell type, Merkel cell polyomavirus has
been implicated in oncogenesis (primarily based on
the demonstration of clonal insertion of the virus in
cases of Merkel cell carcinoma).10 Although the
direct association of Merkel cell polyomavirus
with a particular tumor type is unique among
human polyomaviruses, it is important to note that
other nonhuman polyomaviruses, including SV40,
have long been associated with sarcomas in other
mammals.12,13
As the incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma is so
low, and prospectively collected frozen tissue speci￾mens are rare, an accurate assessment of the
prevalence of Merkel cell polyomavirus in cases of
Merkel cell carcinoma is most readily performed
by analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded

tissue. Our study was designed to perform such an
analysis.
Materials and methods
Case Selection
A search of the files of the Lauren V Ackerman
Laboratory of Surgical Pathology at Washington
University Medical Center from January 1989 to
January 2008 identified 41 cases of surgically
resected Merkel cell carcinoma, including both
cutaneous malignancies and metastases, for which
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
were available. Of the 41 cases, 29 were from unique
patients; 20 cases were from primary cutaneous
excisions, 17 from metastases, and 4 from recur￾rences (Table 1). All cases were reviewed by a
pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. Blocks and
slides were aligned and representative areas were
cored with 2 mm sterile punches (Miltex, Tuttlingen,
Germany).
PCR
The 2 mm tumor cores were deparaffinized and
subjected to 48 h proteinase-K digestion at 551C.
DNA was then extracted using the Puregene Extrac￾tion kit (Gentra Scientific, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
per the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting
DNA was assayed for concentration and protein
contamination to make it possible to standardize
template additions to the PCR amplifications. PCR
was performed using the Platinum Taq HF kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with approximately
100 ng of genomic DNA for each sample. Primers for
b-globin and a multiplexed primer set for a size
ladder (consisting of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 600 bp
products)14 were used as amplification controls.
PCR amplifications consisted of 35 cycles of tem￾plate denaturation at 941C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s
at 501C for LT1 and LT3, at 551C for MCVPS1 and
controls (details of the primer sets used to identify
Merkel cell polyomavirus are shown in Table 2 and
Figure 1), and extension at 681C for 1 min. The
MCVPS1 primer set was designed in silico specifi￾cally for use with human formalin-fixed paraffin￾embedded tissue in that the primers have high
melting temperatures, have low homology to human
genomic DNA at other than the target sequences (the
primers have no binding sites within 50–1000 bp of
one another in human genomic DNA15), produce a
small amplicon, and generate an amplicon with an
internal BamH1 site at position 83 to aid in PCR
product validation. In addition, BLAST homology
searches (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
comparing the MCVPS1 amplicon to all 855 known
polyomaviruses in GenBank showed no significant
homology, reducing the likelihood of cross reactivity
with other polyomaviruses.
PCR Product Verification
Representative PCR products were cloned into
vector pCR2.1 using the TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen),
then sequenced using the Taq dideoxy terminator
cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc.,
Foster City, CA, USA) and a fluorescent DNA
sequencer (373A; Applied Biosystems Inc.). The
resulting sequences were aligned against the Merkel
cell polyomavirus sequence (NCBI gene accession
number 165973999) and showed 100% homology to
the predicted amplicon. For indirect product ver￾ification, the MCVPS1 products were digested with
BamH1 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA)
to yield a smaller 83 bp product detected by agarose
gel electrophoresis (Figure 2).
Regulatory Approval
This study was approved by the Human Studies
Committee at Washington University School of
Medicine.
Results
Patient Population
The average patient age at the time of resection was
71±12 years (range 48–85 years). Of the 29 unique
cases, 20 were from men (69%) and 9 (31%) from
women. The most common primary tumor site was
the head/neck (10 of 17 cases with a documented
primary site), followed by the extremities (4 cases),
and the trunk (3 cases). Of 29 patients, 7 had a
previous diagnosis of malignancy, including 3 cases
of squamous-cell carcinoma, 2 cases of basal cell
carcinoma, 1 case of colorectal adenocarcinoma, and
1 case of chronic lymphocytic lymphoma.
Prevalence of Merkel Cell Polyomavirus
The Merkel cell polyomavirus detection rate from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue varied
with the primer set used, ranging from 32 of 41
cases (78%) for MCVPS1, to 9 of 41 cases (22%) for
LT1, and 17 of 41 cases (41%) for LT3 (Table 1).
Using the MCVPS1 primer set, we detected Merkel
cell polyomavirus in 76% (22 of 29) of unique cases.
Cases that tested positive with the MCVPS1 primer
set were subsequently confirmed by BamH1 diges￾tion and the identification of an 83 bp product
(Figure 3).
The 110 bp b-globin product indicative of the
presence of intact amplifiable DNA could be
amplified from all 41 cases. However, both 100
and 200 bp size control markers could be amplified
from only 35 of 41 cases, and a 300 bp marker from
only 21 of 41 cases; 400 and 600 bp markers could
not be amplified from any cases. Given the decreased
amplification efficiency of larger amplicons, a

well-known consequence of formalin fixation,17 it is
not surprising that the MCVPS1 primer set
(which produces a 109 bp amplicon) detected
Merkel cell polyomavirus in more cases of Merkel
cell carcinoma than the LT1 and LT3 primer sets
(which produce much larger amplicons) (Table 2).
To demonstrate the specificity of the MCVPS1
primer set, we isolated genomic DNA from 40
peripheral blood specimens previously collected
for routine genetic screening. Although it is known
that Merkel cell polyomavirus is not present in
blood (personal communications) it serves as a

control for nonspecific amplification of genomic
DNA with our primer set. None of the 40 samples
showed evidence of Merkel cell polyomavirus by the
MCVPS1 primer set. In addition, all cases of Merkel
cell carcinoma in which Merkel cell polyomavirus
was detected by the LT1 and LT3 primers were also
positive by the MCVPS1 primer set (Table 1), as
expected based on the smaller MCVPS1 amplicon
size (as discussed above).
Eleven patients underwent two or more separate
excisions. Of these, Merkel cell polyomavirus was
detected in both the original and follow-up samples
in eight patients. In two patients (cases 18 and 19
and cases 10 and 20), Merkel cell polyomavirus was
detected in the primary tumor but not in subse￾quently excised metastases. In one patient (cases 7
and 15), Merkel cell polyomavirus was detected in a
metastatic lesion but not the initial tumor.
Discussion
Our demonstration that Merkel cell polyomavirus
is present in 76% (22 of 29) of unique cases of
Merkel cell carcinoma from formalin-fixed, paraffin￾embedded tissue makes several important points.
First, together with the detection of Merkel cell
polyomavirus genomic sequences in paired primary
tumors and metastases, it provides support for a link
between Merkel cell polyomavirus and the oncogen￾esis of Merkel cell carcinoma. Second, on a more
practical level, our development of a primer set
optimized for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue, which minimizes the effects of DNA degra￾dation on test sensitivity and produces a product
that is easily verified by restriction fragment length
analysis, provides a methodology for informative
analysis of Merkel cell carcinoma cases encountered
in routine surgical pathology practice.
Previous studies have also identified Merkel cell
polyomavirus in a high percentage of cases of
Merkel cell carcinoma. In the original study that
identified and implicated Merkel cell polyomavirus
in the oncogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma, the
virus was detected in 8 of 10 cases (80%). However,
fresh frozen tissue was the substrate for analysis,
and the virus could only be detected in one of the
cases by Southern blot analysis of the PCR pro￾ducts.10 In a more recent study, Merkel cell poly￾omavirus was detected in 30 of 39 cases (77%) of
Merkel cell carcinoma from formalin-fixed paraffin￾embedded tissue using the LT3 primer set; in
comparison, we detected the virus in only 17 of 41
cases (41%) using the LT3 primer set, but found a
similar percentage of positive cases (78%) with our
MCVPS1 primer set. The explanation for these
differences in test sensitivity using the same primer
sets in different laboratories is uncertain, but may be
attributable to the age of the tissue blocks, storage
conditions, or differences in viral copy number in
individual cases. In any event, our testing of 2 mm
tumor cores punched from highly cellular areas of
viable tumor using sterile, single-use punches not
only increases test sensitivity by enriching the
neoplastic cell population but also decreases the
risk of cross-contamination.
The fact that three different laboratories have
detected Merkel cell polyomavirus genomic se￾quences in tumor DNA in 75–80% of Merkel cell
carcinoma specimens,10,11 together with the demon￾stration that viral DNA is clonally distributed in
Merkel cell carcinoma10,11 and is present in primary
tumors as well as paired metastases,10 provides
evidence that Merkel cell polyomavirus has a
function in Merkel cell carcinoma oncogenesis.
Although a formal etiological link has not been
established, in the single Merkel cell carcinoma to
date in which the genomic site of integration of

small T antigens.

Merkel cell polyomavirus has been evaluated, the
virus is apparently inserted within the human
receptor tyrosine phosphatase gene at 3p14.2, a
finding that suggests that oncogenesis may occur via
insertional mutagenesis as well as T-antigen expres￾sion.10 As polyomavirus integration is not site
specific in the host genome and occurs in the
absence of specific viral crossover sites or insertion
sequences,18 detailed genetic study of the viral
integration site in a number of different tumors will
likely be required to begin to understand the
function of the various host and viral regions
involved in Merkel cell carcinoma tumorigenesis.
Although molecular genetic analysis of additional
cases is needed to understand the function
of Merkel cell polyomavirus in the development
of Merkel cell carcinoma, there are a number of
questions about the virus that remain unanswered at
an epidemiological level. For example, the route of
infection is unknown, as is the prevalence of
disease. Until the natural history of Merkel cell
polyomavirus infection is more well defined, it is
impossible to evaluate whether there is a need for
screening at-risk populations for the presence of the
virus. Such questions are likely to have increasing
relevance given the increasing number of immuno￾compromised individuals within the general popu￾lation, whether due to HIV infection, organ
transplantation, or as a side effect of therapy for
autoimmune or neoplastic diseases.
Finally, it will be interesting to establish whether
Merkel cell polyomavirus is associated with other
neoplasms that occur in immunocompromised
populations, or with tumors that do not share
similar epidemiological associations but have ex￾tremely similar morphological features (eg, high￾grade neuroendocrine carcinoma). Our development
of a primer set that permits detection of Merkel cell
polyomavirus in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue with a sensitivity similar to that obtained
when fresh tissue is used for analysis broadens the
range of specimens that can be studied to begin to
address these questions.
