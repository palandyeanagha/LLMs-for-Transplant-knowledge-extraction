Abstract
Introduction: Unlike other agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, metformin
has been shown to reduce mortality in obese patients. It is therefore being increasingly used in
higher doses. The major concern of many physicians is a possible risk of lactic acidosis. The
reported frequency of metformin related lactic acidosis is 0.05 per 1000 patient-years; some
authors advocate that this rate is equal in those patients not taking metformin.
Case presentation: We present two case reports of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. The
first case is a 77 year old female with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes
mellitus who had recently been prescribed metformin (3 g/day), perindopril and acetylsalicylic acid.
She was admitted to the emergency department two weeks later with abdominal pain and
psychomotor agitation. Physical examination revealed only signs of poor perfusion. Laboratory
evaluation revealed hyperkalemia, elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and mild
leukocytosis. Arterial blood gases showed severe lactic acidemia. She was admitted to the intensive
care unit. Vasopressor and ventilatory support was initiated and continuous venovenous
hemodiafiltration was instituted. Twenty-four hours later, full clinical recovery was observed, with
return to a normal serum lactate level. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit on
the sixth day. The second patient is a 69 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension,
type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease who was on metformin (4 g/day), glycazide,
acetylsalicylic acid and isosorbide dinitrate. He was admitted to the emergency department in
shock with extreme bradycardia. Initial evaluation revealed severe lactic acidosis and elevated
creatinine and urea. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and commenced on
continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration in addition to other supportive measures. A progressive
recovery was observed and he was discharged from the intensive care unit on the seventh day.
Conclusion: We present two case reports of severe lactic acidosis most probably associated with
high doses of metformin in patients with no known contraindications for metformin prescription.
In both patients no other condition was identified to cause such severe lactic acidosis. Although
controversial, lactic acidosis should be considered in patients taking metformin.

Introduction
Metformin, a dimethylbiguanide, is an oral antihypergly￾cemic drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was
approved in the United States by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) only recently – in 1995.
The results of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes
Study (UKPDS) have provided good evidence of the ben￾efits of metformin on the long-term incidence of diabetic
complications in overweight patients [1].
Biguanides decrease gluconeogenesis from alanine, pyru￾vate, and lactate. The accumulation of lactic acid may
increase under several circumstances[2]. The occurrence
of metformin induced lactic acidosis is exceptional when
the drug is used with caution.
Lactic acidosis is rare, but serious, with a mortality up to
50% [3]. It is a type of high anion gap metabolic acidosis
and is associated with various pathological processes. It
has also been used as a prognostic index of mortality [4].
Metformin can be associated with lactic acidosis in
patients with other clinical conditions that can themselves
cause hyperlactacidemia, namely heart failure, hypoxia
and sepsis. The overall incidence of this complication is
0.05 cases per 1,000 patient-years. Almost all of the
reported cases occurred in patients who had risk factors
for lactic acidosis [5]. But it is impossible to determine to
what extent, if any, metformin may have contribute to the
development of lactic acidosis in any individual case [6].
Salpeter et al [7] in a meta-analysis of 194 studies found
no difference in the incidence of lactic acidosis between
diabetics taking and not taking metformin.
We report the cases of two older adults admitted to our
institution with severe lactic acidosis in the setting of type
2 diabetes treatment with metformin.
Case presentation
Patient 1
A 77-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the emer￾gency department after two weeks of increasing abdomi￾nal pain associated with vomiting. Two days before
admission, she developed psychomotor agitation. She
had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, arterial
hypertension and cerebrovascular disease. She had had a
stroke one month before with full recovery; at that time
her creatinine was normal and she had been discharged
from hospital with the following medications: metformin
3 g daily, perindopril 8 mg daily, and simvastatin 20 mg
daily.
On admission examination revealed a Glasgow Coma
Scale score of 12/15 (E4V3M5), blood pressure 136/87
mmHg, pulse 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20
breaths per minute and core body temperature 36.6°C.
Despite being eupnoeic with oxygen saturation measured
by pulse oximetry was 97% on room air, she presented
with signs of poor perfusion.
Initial investigations revealed a creatinine of 6 mg/dL,
sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 4.7 mEq/L, chloride 103
mEq/L, glucose 216 mg/dL and C-reactive protein 3.14
mg/dl. Complete blood count (CBC) count showed 22.4
× 109/L white blood cells, with haemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL,
and platelet count of 365 × 109/L. Arterial blood gas
showed severe lactic acidosis (pH 6.87, PaCO2 8.2 mmHg,
PaO2 146 mmHg, HCO3
- 1.4 mEq/L, blood lactate 16
mmol/L). Chest X-rays and ECG were normal at the time
of her admission. Serum toxicological results, namely
benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates and
barbiturates, were negative.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)
with the diagnosis of metformin related lactic acidosis.
Continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) was
initiated, with 2 L/h of dyalisate flow and 35 ml/kg/h of
hemofiltration using the solutions from Fresenius HF BIC,
with 2 and 4 mEq/L of potassium as needed, using a high￾flux dyalizer membrane (ultraflux AV 600s). Elective
endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation was
performed.
Four hours after the initiation of CVVHD significant
improvement of acid-base status was observed and blood
lactate level had halved (table 1). On the third day the
patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator. On
the 5th day a primary methicillin resistant Staphylococcus

aureus bloodstream infection was diagnosed and the
patient was started on vancomycin. The patient was dis￾charged to the nephrology department ward on the sev￾enth day.
Full recovery of renal function was observed after 30 days
and the patient was discharged from hospital on the 60th
day medicated with insulin and glycazide.
Patient 2
A 69 year old male was admitted to the emergency depart￾ment with confusion due to altered mental status. His past
medical history included type 2 diabetes, stable angina
and hypertension. There was no previous history of hospi￾talisations. His usual medications included metformin (4
g/day), isosorbide dinitrate (60 mg/day), glycazide (60
mg/day) and acetylsalicylic acid (150 mg/day).
On admission, the patient had extreme bradycardia with
pulse rate 30 beats per minute, respiratory rate 28 breaths
per minute, core body temperature 36.0°C and the blood
pressure was immeasurable using the cuff method. There
were no other significant findings on the physical exami￾nation. ECG showed complete atrio-ventricular block and
the patient was immediately connected to an external
pacemaker with significant haemodynamic improvement,
blood pressure rising to 127/76 mmHg.
Initial investigations showed creatinine 2.2 mg/dL,
sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 3.4 mEq/L and glucose
436 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas showed severe lactic acido￾sis (pH 6.7, PaCO2 32.4 mmHg, PaO2 68.2 mmHg, HCO3
-
5.0 mEq/L, and lactates 18 mmol/L). Hemogram showed
a normocytic, normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 8 g/
dL) and mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 130 × 109/L).
Microscopic examination of the urine sediment showed
the presence of glycosuria. Chest X-rays were normal.
Serum toxicological results, namely for benzodiazepines,
tricyclic antidepressants, opiates and barbiturates, were
negative.
The patient started treatment with fluids, bicarbonate and
insulin infusion since the admission diagnosis was
ketoacidosis. During the procedure to implant a tempo￾rary pacemaker the patient suffered a respiratory-cardiac
arrest followed by shock. He was then transferred to the
ICU where he received vasopressor support with the diag￾nosis of metformin related lactic acidosis. Accordingly,
CVVHD was initiated with 2 L/h of dyalisate flow and 35
ml/kg/h of hemofiltration using the solutions from Fre￾senius HF BIC, with 2 and 4 mEq/L of potassium as
needed, using a high-flux dyalizer membrane (ultraflux
AV 600s).
The patient stabilized after 4 hours of CVVHD with an
improvement of acid-base status and a decreased lactate
level (table 2). At the 12th hour of ICU stay the patient no
longer needed vasopressor support and he recovered sta￾ble sinus rhythm and, as a result, the pacemaker was
removed. On the third day CVVHD was stopped with full
recovery of renal function. On the same day, an early￾onset ventilator associated pneumonia was diagnosed
and the patient was put on empiric broad-spectrum anti￾biotic with piperacilin/tazobactam. Blood cultures, bron￾chial secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage were
negative. The patient improved and was successfully
weaned from the ventilator on the fifth day and was dis￾charged from hospital on the seventh day.
Discussion
There is controversy regarding the association between
metformin use and lactic acidosis [6]. The independent
effect of metformin on the development of lactic acidosis
is unknown. However, metformin-associated lactic acido￾sis is recognized as a potential lethal condition that can
occur in patients with contraindications to the drug, such
as renal failure, sepsis, hypoxaemia, and alcoholism [5,8].
In our two case reports, no other aetiology for such severe
lactic acidosis was found apart from metformin, despite
metformin plasma concentration not having been meas￾ured since its determination was not available in Portugal
at the time. Both patients were type 2 diabetics without
risk factors for developing lactic acidosis such as renal fail￾ure. We were also unable to find any known precipitating
factor that could contribute to such severe lactic acidosis,
namely signs of dehydratation or the presence of toxic
drugs or infection. The only common factor in both
patients were high doses of metformin, in particular in the
second patient since the prescribed metformin daily dose

was superior to the FDA recommendations, and advanced
age, both patients being older than 70 years. Another
unexpected and not described finding was the appearance
of acute renal failure in patients without previous renal
dysfunction. We question whether high doses of met￾formin in older patients could be responsible for acute
renal failure with subsequent lactic acidosis due to drug
accumulation, since metformin is excreted by the kidneys
without being metabolized. Some studies have shown a
positive correlation between serum creatinine and plasma
metformin as well as between plasma metformin and
arterial lactate [9].
Clinical presentations of metformin-associated lactic aci￾dosis are non-specific. Severe hypotension with reduced
systemic vascular resistance and respiratory failure requir￾ing mechanical ventilation has also been reported [9,10].
An aggressive treatment strategy for metformin-associated
lactic acidosis is recommended. Treatment for metformin￾associated lactic acidosis includes adequate supportive
care, management of concurrent disease, correction of
acidemia, acceleration of lactate metabolism, and elimi￾nation of the offending drug by renal excretion or dialysis
[11].
In our patients the early and aggressive treatment with
haemodialfiltration could have improved the outcome
even in the presence of very severe acidosis. Metformin is
a small, non-plasma protein-bound molecule that was
dialyzed out of the body and subsequent full correction of
acid-base status and lactacidemia after 12 hours of contin￾uous venovenous hemodiafiltration was observed in both
patients.
Dialysis techniques are the adequate treatment of lactic
acidosis in diabetic patients treated with metformin since
it rapidly corrects the acid-base disorders and partially
removes the metformin [12].
Since metformin-associated lactic acidosis is associated
with a mortality rate as high as 50%, attention should be
focused on prevention through awareness of the risk fac￾tors [13]. Identification and recognition of cautions and
contraindications are the keys to reducing morbidity and
mortality.
Conclusion
Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare, preventable,
but life-threatening adverse event and should be strongly
suspected in patients presenting with high-anion gap met￾abolic acidosis and high blood lactate concentration
[11,14]. The daily metformin dosage should be no more
than 2.5 g and the dosage o fmetformin should be reas￾sessed as the patient ages [15].
