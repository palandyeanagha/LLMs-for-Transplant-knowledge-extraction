in Salt-Loaded Deoxycorticosterone Acetate-Escaped Rats

A B S T R A C T Proximal and distal tubular function was
compared with urinary excretion in rats after chronic
administration of salt and deoxycorticosterone acetate
(DOCA) or during salt deprivation. DOCA rats ex￾creted significantly more sodium than did salt-deprived
rats. Measurements of tubular fluid to plasma (TF/P)
inulin ratios and concentrations of sodium and potassium
in quantitative, timed collections, related to measured
tubular length, allowed calculation of absolute reab￾sorption of fluid and ions in the different nephron seg￾ments. Proximal transport was not reduced in DOCA￾treated rats compared with salt-deprived animals; in
distal tubule the former group reabsorbed more sodium
and secreted less potassium than the latter. Calculation
of sodium transport in loop of Henle as the difference
in flow between the end of the proximal convolution
and the beginnings of the distal tubule indicated no in￾hibition of reabsorption in DOCA animals. Comparison
of end-distal tubular flow with simultaneous urinary
excretion suggested that sodium load was not the de￾termining factor of enhanced natriuresis in DOCA￾treated animals. The data are interpreted as indicating
that DOCA-escape in the rat is associated with specific
alteration of sodium transport in the collecting duct
system.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic administration of mineralocorticoid results in
transient sodium retention, followed by increasing natri￾uresis to control levels (1, 2). The mechanisms of this
"escape" from the salt-retaining effects of the hormone
remain uncertain. One possibility is development of
insensitivity to mineralocorticoids, presumably in distal
tubule; another is an increase in circulating levels of an
unknown natriuretic substance (3). In dogs, a reduc￾tion of proximal tubular reabsorption has been observed

(luring deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) 1-escape
(4), and suggested as a cause for the rise in sodium
excretion. Since fractional transport in proximal tubule
mav be inhibited with little change in natriuresis (5)
absolute as well as fractional reabsorptions were studied
in proximal and distal tubules of rats showing enhanced
urinary sodium excretion despite continued steroid ad￾ministration. Rats with endogenously elevated levels of
aldosterone and continued salt retention were used for
comparison.
METHODS
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight range = 217-395 g)
were either salt-deprived, receiving the "salt-deficient-diet￾modified" of Nutritional Biochemicals Corp. and distilled
water for at least 3 wk prior to an experiment (27 NaD
rats), or pretreated with deoxycorticosterone acetate (2.5
mg DOCA in oil injected subcutaneously on 5 consecutive
days/wk for 3 wk) while receiving Purina rat chow and
Ringer's solution to drink (29 DOCA rats). The latter
animals were used for experiments during a subsequent 2-3
wk period, while being maintained on Ringer's solution and
weekly injections of DOCA. Experiments were usually
performed 3-4 days after the last injection of the steroid.
Animals were anaesthetized with Inactin, sodium ethyl-
(1-methyl-propyl) -malonyl-thiourea (Promonta, Hamburg,
Germany) (10 mg/100 g body weight i.p.) and maintained
at a body temperature of 380C±0.5 on an electrically heated
operating table. The left kidney was carefully mobilized
(but not decapsulated) through a flank incision and placed
in a lucite cup. A flow of prewarmed mineral oil prevented
drying or cooling of the exposed kidney surface. Both
ureters were cannulated through the flank incision: urine￾from the right, nonexposed kidney was returned continu￾ously to the circulation via a uretero-venous shunt; that.
from the left kidney was collected for subsequent analysis. A
jugular vein and femoral artery were cannulated for in￾fusion, and arterial pressure measurements and blood sam￾pling, respectively. Animals used for proximal micropunc￾4Abbrcviationzs used il this paper: CIn, glomerular filtra￾tion; DOCA, deoxycorticosterone acetate; NaD, salt-de￾prived; SGFR, single nephron filtration rate; TF/P, tubu￾lar fluid to plasma concentration ratio; UKV, urinary ex￾cretion of potassium; UJN, urinary excretion of sodium; V,

ture (see below) also had a catheter threaded into the left
renal vein (6). On completion of operative procedures a
priming dose of [3H]inulin in Ringer's solution (250 uCi
in 0.5 ml/100 g body weight) was injected intravenously
followed by a maintenance infusion of [3H]-inulin-containing
Ringer's at a rate of 0.5 ml/100 g body weight per h.
After an equilibration time of i-1 h, consecutive 15- or
20-min urine collections were taken from the exposed kidney
for 11-2 h; arterial blood samples (0.1 ml) were obtained
for each collection period.
Concurrently, quantitative, timed samples of either proxi￾mal or distal tubular fluid were collected by micropuncture.
A tubule was punctured with a sharpened glass capillary
pipette containing colored heavy mineral oil and filled with
the oil downstream to the puncture site. Oil displaced proxi￾mally was aspired until tubular fluid entered the pipette.
This procedure was usually complete within 10-15 s for
proximal, and 30-60 s for distal tubule. Fluid was then
collected quantitatively for 5-10 or 10-20 min, respectively.
Occasional gentle suction was used to ensure continuous
fluid flow without tubular distention or movement of the
intratubular oil column.
Proximal tubules were studied in 21 DOCA and 22 NaD
rats; distal micropuncture was performed in 13 DOCA
and 11 NaD rats. These groups include five and six ani￾mals, respectively, in which both proximal and distal col￾lections were taken. Simultaneous clearance measurements
were not obtained in five DOCA and four NaD rats of the
proximal series. On completion of the experimental proce￾dures the majority of animals were subsequently used for
studies on blood volume regulation (6, 7). At the end of
the experiment punctured tubules were filled with liquid
latex, the puncture site marked with Sudan black, and
lengths from glomerulus to collection site and last surface
convolution (proximal tubule) or from macula densa to
puncture site and first confluence of two distal tubules (dis￾tal tubule) were measured on the microdissected casts. Oc￾casionally, microdissection revealed a confluence of two
distal tubules proximal to the collection site. Quantitative
data from such collections were halved and an average
length of the two tubules xvas determined.
Concentration of sodium and potassium in urine and
plasma was determined by flame photometry, that of [3H]-
inulin by liquid scintillation counting. Urinary excretion of
fluid (V) and ions (UNaV, UKV) as well as glomerular
filtration (CI.) were calculated. The volume of tubular fluid
collections was measured with a calibrated micropipette of
constant-bore capillary glass and expelled either directly into
the scintillation mixture (proximal fluid) or under oil (dis￾tal fluid). In the latter case 10-20-nl portions were used
for determination of [3H] inulin, as well as for Na and K
by helium glow photometry. Tubular fluid osmolality was
measured with a Clifton nanoliter osmometer (Clifton
Technical Physics, New York). Using the tubular fluid to
plasma (TF/P) concentration ratio of inulin and the mea￾sured rate of quantitative collection of tubular fluid, single
nephron filtration rate (SGFR) and fluid reabsorption to
the proximal or distal puncture site were calculated. Fil￾tered load and tubular reabsorption of sodium were then
determined for each distal tubule, using in addition, the
plasma and tubular fluid concentrations of the ion. Similarly,
filtered and distal tubular load of potassium were calculated.
Standard statistical methods were used for data reduction
and tests of significance (8, 9).
RESULTS
Excretory data for DOCA and NaD rats used for
proximal and distal micropuncture are given in Table
I. Both proximal and distal collections were made in
some animals of the "distal" group. Excretion in both
proximal groups was somewhat depressed compared
with that of the corresponding distal groups, probably
reflecting the more extensive operative procedure in the
former (6). In either case, however, DOCA animals
excreted significantly more sodium (P < 0.05) than
NaD rats. Despite the difference in dietary intake,
plasma sodium concentrations were not statistically
different, while plasma potassium values of DOCA rats
were reduced compared to NaD animals. The difference
in kidney weights reflects the relative weight gains on
the two diets.

Averaged micropuncture data for proximal tubules in
each animal (Table II) show that intratubular flow
wAas higher (P < 0.01) in the DOCA group. Since frac￾tional reabsorption was not different from the NaD
series, a higher absolute rate of proximal transport is
suggested for the high-salt animals. Comparable data
for distal tubules (Table III) indicate that the higher
fluid reabsorption persisted to this nephron segment.
However, the clifferences in intratubular flows are re￾lated in large part to differences in kidney weights
between the two groups (see Table V). In addition,
absolute length of proximal and distal convolution is the
same for DOCA and NaD rats when factored by re￾spective kidney weight. Surprisingly, distal intratubular
concentration of sodium was lower (P < 0.001) in
DOCA rats, as were the concentrations of potassium
and total solute (P < 0.05). Sodium concentrations in
individual proximal tubules of these animals averaged
143±4 SE (n= 17) and 133±3 (it = 14) meq/liter for
DOCA and NaD groups, respectively. Potassium values
were 4.89±0.19 (DOCA, n
= 18) and 5.76±0.22 meq/
liter (NaD, it = 12); corresponding proximal tubular
osmolalities were 299±3 (it = 21) and 303±2 (n = 15)
mosmol/liter.
From the calculated single nephron filtration rates in
individual punctured tubules an average value of SGFR
was obtained for each rat 2 and related to the corre￾sponding value of inulin clearance (Fig. 1). For qtuan￾titative comparison single nephron filtration was multi￾plied by 30,000, the estimated number of glomeruli in a
rat kidney (10). Despite the large variability, signifi￾cant correlation (P < 0.02) of SGFR and CGn is seen
in DOCA and NaD rats used for proximal micropunc￾ture (DOCA: r =0.67; NaD: r= 0.56). No such cor￾relation was evident in animals used for distal micro￾puncttlure, due mainly to the smaller range of filtration
2 If there is a reciprocal relationship between intratubular
flow and TF/P inulin (Tables II, III) an erroneously high
SGFR is obtained by multiplying average flow by average inulin ratio in a given animal.

tal tubule. Expected reabsorption from puncture site to
first confluence of two tubules was calculated using the
appropriate partial regression coefficient f2 (see Table
VII). This reabsorption was then subtracted from the
value of intratubular flow. End-distal delivery was then
related to urinary excretion calculated for the time of
collection and is given for each nephron in Table VI.
It is evident that the magnitude of end-distal delivery
of sodium was not related to simultaneous urinary ex￾cretion of the ion in either DOCA or NaD series. In
addition, the greater natriuresis in the former group
occurred despite an almost uniformly lower end-distal
load. Negative values for Na delivery in the DOCA
series occurred when calculated reabsorption for the
remainder of the distal tubule exceeded intratubular
flow of the ion at the puncture site. Since these values
were associated with extremely low sodium concentra￾tions and/or fluid flow rates Na supply might be con￾sidered as having been rate-limiting under these cir￾cumstances.
DISCUSSION
The salt- and DOCA-treated rats excrete more, and the
salt-deprived rats less sodium than anaesthetized nor￾mal rats (11). Since both groups presumably have high
levels of circulating mineralocorticoids, the first due to
injection of DOCA and the second due to endogenous
aldosterone release, the difference in natriuresis demon￾strates the modification of hormone-induced salt reten￾tion by high salt intake (DOCA escape).
Superficial nephron filtration rates of DOCA rats are
higher than those of salt-deprived animals. Although
absolute fluid reabsorption in proximal tubule is in￾creased proportionately, indicating the operation of glo￾merulo-tubular balance, end-proximal delivery in the
high-salt group remains elevated. This latter finding is
in agreement with results obtained in DOCA-escaped
dogs (4, 12). The difference in tubular load persists to
the beginning of the distal tubule, despite increased so￾dium transport in loop of Henle of DOCA-treated rats,
calculated as the difference in load between end of proxi￾mal and beginning of distal tubule. However, calcu￾lated rates of distal Na reabsorption are higher by al￾most an order of magnitude in the DOCA group, so that
the end-distal sodium delivery is less than that of the
low-salt group. The salt-retaining action of the adminis￾tered mineralocorticoid thus appears to be greater than
that seen with physiologically raised levels of aldosterone.
In view of the usually positive relationship between
distal Na reabsorption and K secretion (13) the lack of
net secretion of potassium in DOCA rats appears dis￾concerting. However, if one assumes that simultaneous
potassium reabsorption (14) may also be enhanced, a
combination of the two opposing effects could account
for the absence of net transfer of the ion in this series.
Calculations of distal tubular transport depend on the
validity of distally measured single nephron filtration
rates. Comparison with proximally determined SGFR in
the same animals (Table IV) revealed no significant
differences, indicating that in these experiments the site
of puncture did not introduce systematic error into the
calculation of individual nephron filtration rate. Since on
the average distal intratubular flow in NaD rats was
lower than in DOCA rats (Table III), a small but con￾sistent contamination of collected sample with fluid
moving retrograde past the distal oil block could still
conceivably account for the difference in intratubular
sodium concentration. Distal collections at flow rates
between 3 and 8 nl/min for both groups were therefore
compared (see Fig. 3). 26 samples from DOCA rats
had an average flow rate of 5.4±0.3 SE nl/min, while 22
collections from NaD rats averaged 5.2±0.3 nl/min.
Intratubular Na concentration, in contrast, was signifi￾cantly different (DOCA = 20.8±2.6, NaD = 51.2±4.8

meq Na/liter; P <0.001), demonstrating a real differ￾ence in sodium transport.
The lack of correlation between end-distal sodium de￾livery by superficial nephrons and urinary Na excretion
(Table VI) demonstrates that the final level of natri￾uresis is dependent on mechanisms located farther down￾stream in the tubular system. One such possible mecha￾nism is a differential delivery of sodium to the collecting
duct system by superficial and deep nephrons. In DOCA
rats, in which the identity of inulin clearance and SGFR
multiplied by total nephron number indicates homo￾geneity of filtration rate, increased Na delivery by deep
nephrons requires the assumption of inhibition of trans￾port in these structures. Conversely, in NaD rats deep
nephrons would be expected to reabsorb most or all of
their sodium load prior to the collecting duct. Al￾though such "salt-conserving" function of juxtamedul￾lary nephrons has been predicted (10, 15), there appears
to be no a priori reason that chronic DOCA administra￾tion should reverse this effect while simultaneously en￾hancing transport in superficial nephrons. It is concluded,
therefore, that alterations in net sodium reabsorption in
the collecting duct system itself have a determining in￾fluence on urinary Na excretion. Since it has been
shown that passive influx of sodium into collecting duct
fluid may occur (16), an increase in permeability, to￾gether with higher medullary sodium concentration as a
result of enhanced ascending limb transport (17) could
account for the escape phenomenon in the DOCA rats.
However an effect of aldosterone on collecting duct epi￾thelium is to reduce passive permeability to sodium (16),
suggesting a specific inhibition of sodium transport in
the terminal nephron segment as a mechanism of DOCA
escape.
APPENDIX
In proximal tubule, absolute fluid reabsorption is dependent
on both filtration rate and on the length of the tubule
available for reabsorption. Although a linear relationship
between reabsorption and filtration is often assumed, this
relation may -be either linear or nonlinear. Similarly the
dependence of reabsorption on tubular length may be linear
or nonlinear. An equation which takes into consideration
these possibilities may be written as follows:
y = a + bxiplX22, (1)
where y represents proximal reabsorption in nanoliters per
minute, x1 and x2 are filtration rate in nanoliters per minute
and tubular length in millimeters, respectively, and a and b
are constants. The exponents of pi and p2 describe the
nature of the relationship of xi and x2 to y: if f = 0 there
is no relationship, if 8= 1 the relationship is linear. Since
the constant a is theoretically equal to zero the log trans￾formation of the equation is given as:
lny = lnb+(llnxl+ 02 lnX2. (2)
Using multiple linear regression analysis (8) the constants
pi and p2 may be evaluated and substituted in equation 1.
Simple orthogonal regression (9) is then used to correlate
reabsorption with the new independent variable x1#1X2/2.
Results of such calculations for both groups of animals are
given below:
DOCA: y = 1.1 + 0.67x10 76x20.46; (r = 0.918) (3)
NaD: y = 0.8 + 0.38x10 96x2035; (r = 0.838). (4)
Correlation coefficients, r, are indicated. By substituting
values for SGFR and proximal tubular length, reabsorption
may be calculated.
In the distal convolution measured intratubular flow was
related to filtered load and absolute length of tubule with
the equation:
Y = 1o + #lXl + 32X2, (5)
where y represents tubular flow of fluid in nanoliters per
minute or of Na or K in nanoequivalents per minute, xi
is filtered load of fluid or ions in nanoliters per minute or
nanoequivalents per minute, x2 equals distal tubular length
in millimeters, and Po, pi, and p2 are constants. Using linear
multiple regression analysis (8), the partial regression co￾efficients Pi and p2 (which indicate the degree of change
of the dependent variable, y for a unit change in one inde￾TABLE VI I

increase in correlation was obtained by transformation of
data to test for nonlinearity of the relationship between
tubular flow and filtered load or length, justifying the use
of equation (5). Data obtained from the multiple regres￾sion analysis are given in Table VII. As indicated by the
partial correlation coefficients r1i.2, at constant distal tubular
length there is significant correlation (P < 0.01) between
filtered load and intratubular flow of fluid, Na, and K in
DOCA as well as NaD rats. Similarly, at constant filtered
load, significant correlation (P < 0.05) with distal length
is found in every case, except for potassium in DOCA rats
and sodium in NaD rats. Data were substituted in the ap￾propriate equations (Table VII) to obtain flow of ions and
water at beginning and end of distal tubule.
