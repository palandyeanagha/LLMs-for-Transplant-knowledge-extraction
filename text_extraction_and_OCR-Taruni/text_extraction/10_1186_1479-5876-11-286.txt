Abstract
Background: ARA290 is a non-erythropoietic EPO derivative which only binds to the cytoprotective receptor
complex (EPOR2-βcR2) consisting of two EPO-receptors (EPOR) and two β common receptors (βcR). ARA290 is
renoprotective in renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In a renal I/R model we focussed on timing of post-reperfusional
administration of ARA290. Furthermore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of ARA290.
Methods: Twenty-six male Lewis/HanHsd rats were exposed to unilateral ischemia for 30 minutes, with subsequent
removal of the contralateral kidney. Post-reperfusion, ARA290 was administered early (one hour), late (four hours) or
repetitive (one and four hours). Saline was used as vehicle treatment. Rats were sacrificed after three days.
Results: Early ARA290 treatment improved renal function. Late- or repetitive treatment tended to improve clinical
markers. Furthermore, early ARA290 treatment reduced renal inflammation and acute kidney injury at three days
post-reperfusion. Late- or repetitive treatment did not affect inflammation or acute kidney injury.
Conclusions: ARA290 attenuated renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study showed the anti-inflammatory effect
of ARA290 and suggests early administration in the post-reperfusional phase is most effective. ARA290 is a candidate
drug for protection against ischemic injury following renal transplantation.

Introduction
As a consequence of the relative shortage of donor or￾gans, marginal donor kidneys, for example kidneys do￾nated after circulatory death (DCD), are increasingly
used. DCD kidneys are exposed to a variable and ex￾tended primary warm ischemic period compared to
donor kidneys of brain dead- or living donors. Therefore
renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important
cause of short-term dysfunction in DCD kidneys. Renal
I/R injury results in an increased incidence of delayed
graft function (DGF) of 72% in DCD kidneys versus 18%
in kidneys donated after brain death (DBD). In primary
non function (PNF) the differences are even more pro￾nounced, respectively 23% versus 4%. Subsequently, the
increased incidence of PNF causes reduced graft survival
of DCD kidneys [1]. In DCD donation, the occurrence of
primary warm ischemia is inevitable; however a substantial
part of the damage occurs during the reperfusion phase
[2]. This makes cytoprotective treatment early after trans￾plantation an attractive opportunity to improve short- and
long-term outcome of kidney transplants.
In pre-clinical studies it has been shown that erythro￾poietin (EPO), administered post-reperfusion, is able to
attenuate renal I/R injury [3]. Therefore, EPO mediated
cytoprotection may improve short- and even long-term
renal function following kidney transplantation with
marginal donor kidneys.

(EPOR2) on erythroid progenitor cells, but cytoprotection is
mediated by binding of EPO to a heteromeric receptor com￾plex consisting of two EPOR and two β common receptors
(EPOR2-βcR2) [4]. Activation of this protective receptor
complex increases janus kinase-2 (JAK-2) phosphorylation,
which results in a cascade of anti-inflammatory, anti￾apoptotic and pro-survival effects [5,6]. Furthermore, EPO
also directly affects renal function. EPO enhances endothe￾lial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity [7,8] which in￾creases vasodilatation of the afferent arterioles. This results
in increased glomerular filtration rate [9,10].
However, a major drawback in the use of EPO as a
cytoprotective agent is its stimulative effect on erythro￾poiesis and also thrombopoiesis. An increased serum
EPO raises the haematocrit and markedly enhances
platelet and endothelial activation [11] is associated with
adverse effects, such as thrombotic events which can be
life threatening. The binding affinity of the protective
EPOR2-βcR2 complex for EPO is considerably lower
compared to the affinity of the classical, erythropoietic
EPO receptor complex [12]. Therefore the required dose
of EPO for cytoprotection will be relatively high, which
increases the risk of cardiovascular adverse events. Based
on pre-clinical studies cytoprotective, high dose EPO
treatment has been evaluated in four clinical trials. None
of these trials were able to show reduced PNF, reduced
DGF or improved short-term renal function. One study
even observed an increased risk of thrombosis [13-16].
To avoid these adverse events and provide the oppor￾tunity to safely administer relatively high doses, EPO
derivatives have been developed that only activate the
EPOR2-βcR2 complex and do not stimulate erythropoiesis
[17]. ARA290 is a small synthetic peptide, which selectively
binds to the EPOR2-βcR2 complex. It has already been
shown that ARA290, also known as pHBSP, has no erythro￾poietic properties and is renoprotective in a rodent models
of renal I/R [17,18]. Mechanistically, ARA290 activates sur￾vival pathway AKT and inhibits pro-inflammatory pathway
glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) [18]. Recently, we
showed the renal protective capacities of ARA290 in a renal
I/R model in pigs. ARA290, administered repetitively at
zero, two, four and six hours post-reperfusion, improved
renal function and reduced structural damage [19].
We hypothesized that post-reperfusional administra￾tion of ARA290 reduces inflammation and improves
renal function following renal I/R in rats. Three different
times of post-reperfusional administration have been
tested to investigate the effect of timing of ARA290
treatment. Kidney function, inflammation and renal
morphology were studied at three days post-reperfusion.
Materials and methods
Animals
Twenty-six male Lewis/HanHsd rats (Harlan, Horst, the
Netherlands, 250–300 gr.) were used. They were housed
individually with free access to water and rat chow. One
rat was excluded because of unsuccessful clamping of the
vena and arteria renalis (control group). Two rats died
during surgery (control group and repetitive treatment)
and one rat has been terminated at day one because of re￾spiratory failure (control group). The animal experiments
were approved by the animal ethics committee of the uni￾versity Groningen (DEC-RuG, 4762B, Groningen, the
Netherlands). The experiments were performed according
to international and Dutch guidelines of animal research.
ARA290
ARA290 (ARAIM Pharmaceuticals, Ossining, USA) is a
small synthetic peptide consisting of eleven amino acids.
It has been derived from the binding site of EPO to the
protective EPOR2-βcR2 complex and it does not bind to
the classical EPOR2 complex. The plasma half-life is ap￾proximately two minutes.
Study design
The animals were randomized into four groups and
treated at one, four or one and four hours post￾reperfusion (Table 1). The used concentration ARA290
was 10 nmol/kg (10 nmol/kg = 12.58 ug/kg) and saline
(0.9%) served as vehicle treatment. The control group
was vehicle treated at one and four hours post￾reperfusion. Times of administration and dosage of
ARA290 were chosen based on earlier renal I/R experi￾ments [17,19]. Both ARA290 and saline were injected in￾traperitoneally. A standardized I/R model was used to
determine the effectiveness of ARA290. The warm ische￾mic time was 30 minutes and the rats were sacrificed
72 hours post-reperfusion.
Surgical procedure
All animals were sedated using ketamine (0.75 μl/g) and
medetomedine (0.5 μl/g). As an analgesic, buprenorfine

was used (pre-operative: 0.005 μl/g, directly post￾operative: 0.02 μl/g, 24 hours post-operative: 0.025 μl/g).
Once the abdomen was opened, unilateral renal ischemia
of 30 minutes was performed by clamping the vena and
arteria renalis with non-traumatic clamps. The contralat￾eral kidney was removed during the ischemic period. After
72 hours blood samples were collected under anaesthesia.
After this the animals were sacrificed by performing a car￾diotomy. Prior to removal of the kidney, it was flushed via
the aorta with 10 ml 0.9% NaCl at 4°C.
Samples
Blood samples were stored at −80°C and serum parame￾ters were measured using standard protocols. A section
of the kidney was snap frozen in N2 and stored in −80°C.
For immunohistochemistry and morphology another sec￾tion was fixed in 4% formalin and subsequently embedded
in paraffin.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
RNA was extracted from snap frozen sections of total
kidney tissue using Trizol reagent according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Breda, the Netherlands).
Total RNA was treated with DNAse I to remove genomic
DNA contamination (Invitrogen, Breda, the Netherlands).
The integrity of total RNA was analysed by gel electro￾phoresis. cDNA synthesis was performed from 1-μg total
RNA using M-MLV (Moloney murine leukaemia virus)
Reverse Transcriptase and oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen,
Breda, The Netherlands).
Primer sets (Table 2) were designed using Primer Ex￾press 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Amplification and detection were performed with
the ABI Prism 7900-HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems) using emission from SYBR green
master mix (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reactions
were performed in triplicate. After an initial activation
step at 50°C for 2 min and a hot start at 95°C for
10 min, PCR cycles consisted of 40 cycles at 95°C for
15 sec and 60°C for 60 sec. Dissociation curve analysis
were performed for each reaction to ensure amplifica￾tion of specific products.
Gene expression of tumour necrosis factor–α (TNF-α),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1),
α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and β-actin (housekeep￾ing gene) were determined. Gene expression was normal￾ized with the mean of b-actin mRNA content. Results
were finally expressed as 2–ΔCT (CT = threshold cycle),
which is an index of the relative amount of mRNA expres￾sion in each tissue.
Immunohistochemistry
Kidney samples were cut into 4-μm-thick sections. The
morphology was evaluated by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
staining. Immunohistochemical stainings for Kim-1
(acute tubular damage) and α-SMA (pre-fibrotic changes)
were performed on paraffinized tissue. HIS-48 (anti￾granulocyte antibody) was stained on cryosections.
Deparaffinised sections were subjected to antigen re￾trieval. For the Kim-1 staining sections were incubated
for one night in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.0). Antigen
retrieval was not necessary for the α-SMA or HIS-48
staining.
Endogeneous peroxidase was blocked by 0.3% H2O2
for 30 minutes. Kim-1 (1:400, Bonventre), α-SMA
(1:400, Abcam, 1A4, Cambridge, UK) and HIS-48 (1:2,
Department of pathology and Microbiology, University
Medical Center Groningen) antibodies were used. The
incubation time of the primary antibodies was 1 hour. For
the Kim-1 staining a secondary peroxidase-conjungated
goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1:100, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark)
and a tertiary peroxidase-conjungated rabbit-anti-goat
antibody (1:100, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) were used.
For the α-SMA staining we only used a secondary
peroxidase-conjungated goat-anti-mouse antibody (1:50,
DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). For the HIS-48 staining a
secondary peroxidase-conjungated rabbit-anti-mouse anti￾body (1:100, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and a tertiary
peroxidase-conjungated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1:100,
DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) were used. Normal rat serum
(1:100) was added to the secondary and tertiary antibodies
and the incubation time was 30 minutes. Then the perox￾idase activity was visualized by ten minutes incubation in
3.3-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride or aminoethylcarbazole
for respectively paraffinized- or crysections. Subsequently
the sections were counterstained with haematoxylin.
Finally, the sections were scanned using APERIO scan￾scope (Aperio, Vista, United States). The expression of
the immunohistochemical staining of each section was
quantified using APERIO image scope software.

Statistical analyses
All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). Kruskal-Wallis H test with Dunn’s multiple
comparison test as post hoc analyses was used to analyse
the data. All groups were compared to the controls.
A p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Clinical parameters
Early ARA290 treatment at one hour post-reperfusion
significantly reduced serum creatinine levels at three
days post-reperfusion compared to the control group.
Late or repetitive treatment did not significantly change
serum creatinine levels (Figure 1A). Serum urea levels
showed a similar tendency although these differences
were not significant (Figure 1B). No differences in serum
aspartate transaminase (ASAT) or lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) levels were found.
Inflammation
qRT-PCR analyses was used to measure the expression
of markers of renal inflammation at three days post￾reperfusion. Early ARA290 treatment at one hour post￾reperfusion significantly reduced IL-6 mRNA expression
compared to the controls (Figure 2A). Renal expression of
TNF-α tended to be reduced in early treated animals
(Figure 2B). Late and repetitive treatment did not signifi￾cantly influence mRNA expression of both inflammatory
markers (Figure 2A and B). Granulocyte infiltration was
evaluated by His-48 staining at three days post-reperfusion.
Early ARA290 treatment tended to reduce His-48 expression
in cortical tissue. Late- or repetitive treatment did not affect
His-48 expression (Figure 3).
Morphology
Three days post-reperfusion animals of the control
group showed severe renal damage, evidenced by tubular
dilatation, cell death and cellular debris in renal tubuli
(Figure 4A). Hardly any structural damage was found in
the early treatment group (Figure 4B). In the groups
treated at four hours (Figure 4C) or one and four hours
(Figure 4D) post-reperfusion we observed slightly re￾duced renal damage compared to the controls.
Acute kidney injury
Kim-1 mRNA expression, a marker of acute renal injury,
was reduced in the early treatment group compared to
the controls. No significant differences between late- or
repetitive treatment and the controls were found (Figure 5).
Kim-1 protein expression was predominantly observed in
the distal tubuli. According to Kim-1 mRNA expression,
early ARA290 treatment reduced cortical Kim-1 protein
expression (Figure 6A and B, Figure 7).
Figure 1 The effect of ARA290 on markers of renal function.
Early ARA290 treatment significantly reduced serum creatinine
levels at three days post-reperfusion. Late- and repetitive ARA290
treatment tended to reduce serum creatinine levels to a lesser
extent (A, p < 0.05). The treatment effect of ARA290 on serum urea
levels showed the same tendency as the effect on serum creatinine
levels (B).

treatment reduced mRNA expression of markers of inflammation.
IL-6 expression was significantly reduced by early treatment com￾pared to controls (A, p < 0.05), while TNF-α expression showed a
comparable tendency (B). The anti-inflammatory effects of late- or
repetitive treatment were less pronounced.

Structural damage
To investigate the effect of ARA290 on structural dam￾age we measured mRNA and protein expression of α￾SMA, a marker of pre-fibrotic changes. None of the
three treatment regimens influenced mRNA expression
of α-SMA (Figure 8A). This result was confirmed by
quantification of immunohistochemical staining of α￾SMA in cortical tissue. ARA290 treatment did not re￾duce interstitial α-SMA expression as measured at three
days post-reperfusion (Figure 8B).
Discussion
In this study the renoprotective capacities of ARA290
were tested in a rodent model of renal I/R injury. We
specifically focussed on timing and the anti-inflammatory
capacities of post-reperfusional treatment of ARA290.
ARA290 improved renal function, reduced inflammation
and acute kidney injury three days following renal I/R.
These results are in line with three recent studies showing
attenuation of renal I/R injury by ARA290 [17-19]. Early
administration of ARA290 after reperfusion appears to be
most effective to attenuate renal I/R injury.
The anti-inflammatory effects are widely described for
EPO mediated cytoprotection [5,20,21]. Patel et al.
already showed that ARA290 inhibits pro-inflammatory
pathway GSK-3β [18]. In our porcine renal I/R model
ARA290 tended to reduce acute inflammation measured
fifteen minutes after the first dose administration [19].
In this study we confirmed these anti-inflammatory ef￾fects as measured by reduced IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA
expression. In line with the RT-PCR analyses early
ARA290 treatment tended to reduce granulocyte

was observed (A). Especially, early ARA290 treatment resulted in a distinct reduction of tubular damage (B). Late- (C) and repetitive treatment (D)
slightly reduced renal damage.

ARA290 treatment reduced Kim-1 expression at three days post￾reperfusion indicating reduced acute kidney injury (p < 0.05). Late- or
repetitive treatment did not reduce Kim-1 mRNA expression.

infiltration. Furthermore, ARA290 reduced kim-1 ex￾pression indicating reduced acute kidney injury [22].
Based upon these results, this study confirmed the al￾leged anti-inflammatory effects of non-erythropoietic
EPO derivative ARA290.
The direct effect on renal function, expressed by re￾duced serum creatinine levels, can be explained by in￾creased eNOS phosphorylation as eNOS is known as a
regulator of the renal function [9]. An eNOS knock-out
model showed that eNOS is essential for attenuation of
renal I/R injury by EPO [7,8]. eNOS phosphorylation is
reduced in the first 6 hours following renal I/R injury
and restored to normal levels at 24 hours after reperfu￾sion [23]. This suggests that the optimal window of
treatment of EPO mediated cytoprotection is in the first
6 hours. As eNOS phosphorylation levels are normalized
after 24 hours, measuring eNOS phosphorylation at
three days post-reperfusion is relatively late. Therefore,
the effect of ARA290 on eNOS phorsphorylation has
not been determined in this study. Patel et al. showed
that EPO and ARA290 are able to increase eNOS phos￾phorylation following renal I/R [18]. In our porcine renal
I/R study we showed that ARA290 increases nitrite and
nitrate clearance in the first 24 hours post-reperfusion
indicating increased nitric oxide synthase activity [19].
Three earlier I/R studies in which ARA290 has been
tested, used different timing regimens. In mice I/R,
treatment was administered at repetitively at one mi￾nute, six hours and twelve hours post-reperfusion [17].
Plasma creatinine, urea and ASAT were significantly re￾duced 24 hours post-reperfusion [17]. In a rat I/R model
ARA290 treatment at six hours post-reperfusion reduced
serum creatinine levels [18]. Repetitive treatment at zero,
two, four and six hours post-reperfusion improved renal
function and reduced structural damage in a porcine I/R
model [19].
We therefore investigated the effect of early-, late- and
repetitive administration of ARA290 in the reperfusional
phase. ARA290 was administered at one hour, four
hours or one and four hours post-reperfusion. Only
ARA290 administered at one hour post-reperfusion in￾duced significant renoprotection. In contrast, Patel et al.
showed that ARA290 is protective in rats when adminis￾tered even 6 hours post-reperfusion and in porcine renal
I/R ARA290 was renoprotective when administered

Kim-1 protein expression. Representative sections of control- (A) and early ARA290 treatment (B) are shown.

repetitively at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-reperfusion
[18,19]. The low number of animals is a limitation of
this study. Especially since only four animals were in￾cluded in the control group, due to technical failures.
However, in all treatment groups the number of animals
was similar (N = 6). This means also power to show differ￾ences between controls and treatment groups was equal.
The main outcome parameter, serum creatinine, was sig￾nificantly reduced by early ARA290 treatment. Observing
the tendency of reduced serum creatinine levels by repeti￾tive and late ARA290 treatment, the number of animals
may have been too low to show significant differences in
these groups. It is unlikely that the accumulative dose im￾pairs renoprotective capacities of repetitive ARA290 treat￾ment as the half-life is only several minutes. Possibly
secondary activation of the EPOR2-βcR2 receptor complex
is detrimental in rats. However, porcine models are more
suitable to further investigate timing of ARA290 for trans￾lation to the human setting as pigs are physiologically
more comparable to human. This study shows the import￾ance of timing and gives direction to design of large ani￾mal models testing the protective capacities of ARA290
against renal I/R injury.
In this study the animals were euthanized three days
post-reperfusion. No differences were found in α-SMA
expression in contrast to the porcine I/R model [19].
Morphologically, ARA290 treatment reduced tubular
dilatation and cell death indicating reduced structural
damage. Villanueva et al. showed that α-SMA expres￾sion can already be up-regulated 24 hours after renal is￾chemia/reperfusion [24]. Seven days post-reperfusion
ARA290 prevented increased expression of α-SMA fol￾lowing porcine renal I/R [19]. Although α-SMA expres￾sion can be up-regulated early following I/R, three days
post-reperfusion might have been too early to measure
changes in this study.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study shows the renoprotective proper￾ties of early post-reperfusion administrated ARA290. Early
administration at one hour post-reperfusion is distinctly
more effective than treatment at four hours post-reperfu￾sion. Besides, this study shows the anti-inflammatory cap￾acities of ARA290. Considering the renoprotective and
anti-inflammatory effects of ARA290, it is a promising
treatment to attenuate renal I/R injury following renal
transplantation. Especially, DCD- or older DBD kidneys at
risk for DGF and PNF are potential targets of ARA290
mediated cytoprotection. These results warrant further in￾vestigation of the protective effects and timing of ARA290
in large animal models of renal transplantation.
