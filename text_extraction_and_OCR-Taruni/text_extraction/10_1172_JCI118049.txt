Abstract protein kinase (MAPK) * isozymes * cAMP-phosphodies￾terase
We studied interactions between the mitogen-activated pro￾tein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and cAMP-protein
kinase (PKA) signaling pathway in regulation of mitogen￾esis of mesangial cells (MC) determined by [3H]thymidine
incorporation, with or without added EGF. Forskolin or
dibutyryl cAMP strongly (by 60-70%) inhibited [3H]-
thymidine incorporation into MC. Cilostamide, lixazinone
or cilostazol selective inhibitors of cAMP-phosphodiesterase
(PDE) isozyme PDE-L, inhibited mitogenesis to similar
extent as forskolin and DBcAMP and activated in situ PKA,
but without detectable increase in cAMP levels. Cilostamide
and cilostazol were more than three times more effective at
inhibiting mesangial mitogenesis than rolipram and denbu￾fylline, inhibitors of isozyme PDE-IV, even though PDE-IV
was two times more abundant in MC than was PDE-M. On
the other hand, when incubated with forskolin, rolipram￾enhanced cAMP accumulation was far greater (10-10Ox)
than with cilostamide. EGF increased MAPK activity
(+300%); PDE isozyme inhibitors which suppressed mito￾genesis also inhibited MAPK. PDE isozyme inhibitors also
suppressed PDGF-stimulated MC proliferation. We con￾clude that cAMP inhibits the mitogen-dependent MAPK￾signaling pathway probably by decreasing the activity of
Raf-1 due to PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation. Further, we
surmise that minor increase in the cAMP pool metabolized
by PDE-l is intimately related to regulation of mesangial
proliferation. Thus, PDE isozyme inhibitors have the poten￾tial to suppress MC proliferation by a focused effect upon
signaling pathways. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 96:401-410.)

Introduction
The accelerated proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells
(MC)' is a common feature of the many glomerular diseases
(1-3). The cell cycle of MC is under the influence of a large
number of humoral autocrine and/or paracrine factors which
either promote or suppress mitogenesis and cell proliferation
(1-4). In certain glomerulopathies some of these autocrine
factors are produced in high quantity by stimulated MC ( 1-4).
Moreover, in the case of infiltrative glomerular lesions, large
quantity of mitogens are also generated by invading inflamma￾tory cells (1, 3, 5). Understanding of the signal transduction
systems by which these humoral factors modulate the rate of
MC proliferation is essential for rational design of novel phar￾macotherapeutic approaches aimed to suppress the excessive
proliferation of MC in glomerular diseases.
Recent observations established that some growth factors
and cytokines stimulate the mitotic synthesis of DNA and cell
proliferation by activation of the so-called mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation cascade (6, 7). This
signaling pathway (details of which are outlined in recent re￾views) (6-10) is initiated by mitogen binding to its receptor,
tyrosine phosphorylations, which is followed by interactions of
"small adaptor proteins" which promote conversion of mem￾brane-anchored Ras-GDP to active form Ras-GTP (11, 12).
Active Ras-GTP then promotes translocation of a protoonco￾gene-coded protein Raf- 1 from cytoplasm to the membrane,
which results in activation of the protein kinase moiety of
Raf-l (13). The Raf-l is first the protein kinase (6, 7, 9) which
activates by phosphorylation another protein kinase (MEK or
MAPKK), which in turn ultimately activates the key enzyme
of the cascade the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK).
Then, activation of Raf- 1 protein kinase initiates a sequence of
protein phosphorylations which ultimately leads to activation
of MAPK, which then triggers mitotic DNA synthesis and initi￾ates the cell replication cycle (6, 7, 10), via proline-directed
phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors of immediate
early genes (9).
Several investigators found recently that in some cell types
the mitogen-activated MAPK phosphorylation cascade and
stimulation of cell proliferation by growth factors/cytokines
can be inhibited by "crosstalk" with another signaling system
(12, 14-17) the cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA). Ac￾cording to current evidence, when cAMP-activated PKA phos￾phorylates Ser43 in the regulatory domain of the Raf-1 molecule
(16), the protein kinase activity in the catalytic domain of
Raf-1 is inhibited. Since Raf-1 protein kinase initiates the whole
cascade of phosphorylations, its inhibition ultimately prevents

activation of MAPK and inhibits mitogenesis ( 11-17). In stud￾ies of nonrenal cell types (12) the cAMP-PKA pathway was
activated by potent stimuli of adenylate cyclase such as for￾skolin ( 14) or cholera toxin ( 15), or by high doses of hormonal
agonists of adenylate cyclase (15). All of these stimuli of ade￾nylate cyclase caused considerable accumulation of cAMP
which, in turn, elicited marked inhibition of proliferation of
smooth muscle cells (14), adipocytes (15), or of fibroblasts
(16, 17). However, in a number of other cell types, such as
PC12 cell line of neural origin (18), thyroid cells, and others
( 19), the enhanced levels of cAMP stimulated rather than inhib￾ited activity of MAPK and promoted cell growth and differentia￾tion ( 18, 19).
In our preceding study of isolated rat glomeruli we observed
that antagonists of some isozymes of cyclic-3',5'-nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDE),2 mainly PDE-IV (22), in very low
concentrations suppress the generation of endogenous reactive
oxygen metabolites via activation of PKA but without measur￾able increase in cAMP content. These observations suggested
to us that decreased turnover of a cAMP pool, which is con￾trolled by a specific PDE isozyme(s), can activate cAMP-PKA
pathway without stimulation of adenylate cyclase and without
significant change of measurable cAMP content (22).
In view of these observations (22) and reports of inhibitory
crosstalk of cAMP-PKA with the MAPK-signaling pathway
(12) from studies of nonrenal tissues (14-17), we investigated
which PDE isozymes are present and prevalent in rat glomerular
MC and then we examined whether selective inhibition of PDE
isozyme (s) would cause activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway
(22) and thereby result in crosstalk inhibition (12) of MC pro￾liferation, either in the ambient state or in cells stimulated by
mitogens.
Methods
MC preparation and culture. Glomeruli were isolated from 200-gram
male Sprague-Dawley rats by differential sieving, as previously de￾scribed (35). Cell outgrowths were characterized as MC by positive
immunohistochemical staining for vimentin, smooth muscle-specific
actin, and negative stains for cytokeratins, factor ViII-related antigen,
and leukocyte common antigen (antibodies from Dako Corp., Carpin￾teria, CA). Cells used in experiments were from 4-10 passages and
completely homogenous MC according above mentioned criteria. Rat
MC were plated in 150-mm culture dishes in complete Waymouth's
medium (Waymouth's medium supplemented with 20% heat-inacti￾2. In this report, the PDE isozymes are classified as proposed by Dr.
J. A. Beavo (20, 21). According to this nomenclature, PDE-I is the
family (also called "type") of PDE isozymes dependent on ionized
calcium (Ca2+) and calmodulin (CaM); PDE-H is family of isozymes
cAMP-PDE activity of which is stimulated by low (,uM range) concen￾tration of cGMP; the PDE-Ifl are isozymes with low Km for cAMP and
are sensitive to inhibition by cilostamide, "cardiotonic inhibitors" and
cGMP; PDE-IV are isozymes with very high affinity and selectivity for
cAMP, are selectively inhibited by rolipram, RO-20-1724 and denbufyl￾line; PDE-V are those isozymes which selectively hydrolyze only cGMP
independent of Ca2+/CaM; bind allosterically cGMP, and are present
in somatic cells; PDE-VI is selective cGMP-PDE which is uniquely
localized in photoreceptor and interacts with GTP-binding protein trans￾ducin (Gr); PDE-VII is strictly cAMP-PDE which is insensitive to all
now known PDE inhibitors; cognate mRNA was found in lymphocytes,
in skeletal muscle, myocardium and the kidney.
vated fetal calf serum (FCS), 15 mM Hepes, 1 mM Na pyruvate,
0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamamine, 50 IU/ml
penicillin, 50 jtg/ml streptomycin, and 1% ITS+ (insulin, transferrin,
selenium, and bovine serum albumin).
Measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation. Rat MC were plated
into 24-well culture dishes at 5 x 10" cells/well and grown 24 h to
confluency (36). Cells were rendered quiescent by incubating them in
Waymouth's medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS for 72 h (35). After
addition of test compounds and growth factors 1 h later, cultures were
incubated for 16 h. In experiments with H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, the
cells were first incubated with or without H-89 for 60 min then cilosta￾mide was added and incubation continued for 17 h and concluded as
in other experiments. Then [6-3H]thymidine, 1 .tCi/ml, was added and
cultures incubated for an additional 4 h (28, 29). Cells were washed
two times with PBS and lysed by addition of 0.2 N NaOH. After 20
min, the cell lysate was neutralized with HCl, TCA was added to a final
concentration of 10%, the solution was passed over glass fiber discs
(GF/C, Whatman), washed twice with 10% TCA, and. once with 70%
ethanol. Radioactivity retained on the discs was determined by liquid
scintillation counting. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was used as a
measure of the rate of mitogenic synthesis of DNA (35). In control
experiments, neither 10 piM cilostamide nor 10 1M rolipram nor both
inhibitors combined, influenced significantly the initial (60 s) uptake
of [3H]thymidine by MC.
Assay for cAMP. The MC were incubated with test agents in 24-
well plates for 60 min (see Fig. 3), or for 16 h as in the [3H] thymidine
incorporation experiments. The incubation was terminated by adding
5% TCA (final concentrations) to the wells, cells scraped, and the
mixture was incubated on ice for 0.5 h. The TCA was extracted with
water-saturated ether and the cAMP content was measured using radio￾immunoassay (RIA) as previously described (22, 23).
Lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH). Activity was assayed in a
media of cultured MC at the end of incubation period by measuring the
rate of reduction of pyruvate to lactate using Sigma Diagnostics kit
(procedure No 228-UV). LDH activity was then calculated from the
change in 340-nm absorbance per 1 min and expressed per unit volume
of medium.
Preparation of extracts and fractions of MCfor PDE determina￾tions. MC were grown to confluency in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks.
Cells were scraped and homogenized in an ice-cold medium containing
(final concentrations); 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5
mM ,i-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 ,uM leupeptin, 0.1 ILM pepstatin, and 0.1
ptM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mM
Tris-HCl adjusted to pH 7.4. Cells were homogenized by 10 strokes in
a Potter-type teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centri￾fuged for 60 min at I05 g. The supernatant, denoted "extract," was used
for PDE assay (23). In experiments when cytosol and total membrane
fractions were separated, cells were homogenized similarly, except that
0.3 M sucrose was added and 0.1% Triton-X-100 was omitted from the
homogenization medium. The homogenates were centrifuged at 60 min
at 10' g and the pellet was resuspended in the same medium, centrifuga￾tion repeated; first and second supernatants were combined and consti￾tuted the total soluble fraction or "cytosol." The washed second pellet
was resuspended again in a medium of the same composition but with
0.1% Triton X-100 and without sucrose, centrifuged for 40 min at I05
g, and the supernatant referred to as "total membrane fraction." The
samples were assayed immediately or stored after addition of ethyl￾eneglycol (final concentration 30%) at -20°C until used (maximum 6
d). The protein was determined by the Bradford method (24).
Phosphodiesterase (PDE) assay. The PDE activity was measured
by incubating the extracts or fractions in a final volume 110 jid of the
following medium: (final concentrations): 10 mM MgSO4, 2 mM
EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 15 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), and
either 0.5 tM [3H]-cAMP or [3H]-cGMP as substrate (26, 30). In
experiments examining the activity of Ca2 -calmodulin-dependent
PDEs, the reaction mixture also contained 2.01 mM CaCl2, to obtain
10 11M Ca2+, and 10 nog/ml of calmodufin (CaM). The PDE activity
402 Matousovic et al.

in aliquots incubated without Ca2" and CaM (but with 2 mM EGTA,
vide supra) was determined as a basal activity (26, 30). PDE-Hl and
PDE-IV activities were determined as cAMP-PDE inhibitable by 3 JIM
cilostamide or rolipram, respectively, as in our preceding studies (22,
23). At these concentrations (3 OM) both rolipram and cilostamide
cause maximal inhibition of corresponding PDEs (22, 23); no or only
slight increase of inhibition was achieved by increasing the dose of
rolipram or cilostamide from 3 to 10 uM. The PDE-H activity was
determined as the difference in cAMP-PDE without or with added 5
tM cGMP (22). Stock solutions of all inhibitors were made in 100%
DMSO and all the incubation media, including controls, contained final
concentration, 0.1% DMSQ. Hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP was < 20%
of the substrate and was linearly proportional to incubation time and
enzyme protein (22, 23).
Measurement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity in
situ. We used a method described by Corbin et al. (25) as in our
previous study (22) with minor modifications. Quiescent MC cultures
in (diameter 6 cm) Petri dishes were incubated either without added
agents (controls), or with PDE isozyme inhibitors for 60 min to assure
penetration of compounds into cells, or with forskolin for 10 min. The
incubation was terminated by chilling the plate to 0-40C and quickly
scraping the cells which were then pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500
g for 5 min at 0-40C. The supernatant was discarded and the packed
MC were homogenized in a medium containing (final concentrations):
0.25 M sucrose, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl, l-methylxanthine, 4 mM EDTA,
and 20 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.8. The homogenate was centrifuged at
27,000 g for 30 min at 0-40C. The PKA activity was measured in the
supernatant by the incorporation of 32P-y-ATP into the oligopeptide
Kemptide (25, 26). The MC extract was incubated in a mixture (final
concentrations): 10 j1M 32P-y-ATP (1 juCi), 0.4 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 8 mM NaF, 0.6 mg/ml BSA, 160 iM "Kemptide" 20 mM
MES-NaOH, (pH 6.8) either with or without 1 ,.M added cAMP, and
2 jig of protein extract per tube. The incubation was carried out for 6
min at 30C, and stopped by placing the incubation mixture on 2 X 2
cm2 phosphocellulose papers (Whatman P 81) which were then im￾mersed into 10 mM NaJ'207 in 1% H3PO4. The papers were then
washed (3 x 15 min) in 1% H3PO4 dried and 32p was determined by
liquid scintillation counting. Used PDE isozyme inhibitors did not inter￾fere with PKA assay (22). The PKA activity was assayed in one aliquot
without cAMP, another aliquot with 1 jLM cAMP (maximum stimula￾tory dose), and also in aliquot with 1 tiM cAMP plus maximum inhibi￾tory dose (10 ,M) of a specific PKA oligopeptide inhibitor WTPTIDE
(22, 26). The difference between PKA activity without and with 10
ILM WIPITIDE was taken as specific PKA activity, the residual protein
kinase activity in the presence of WJFJ7DE was subtracted (22). In
situ activity of PKA was determined as a ratio of PKA activity measured
without added cAMP (-cAMP) to total PKA activity measured with
1 1AM cAMP (+cAMP) and expressed as (-cAMP/+cAMP) PKA
activity ratio (22, 25).
MAPK activity. MC grown in 6-cm-diameter dishes were rendered
quiescent in 0.5% FCS, cells were incubated in the same medium con￾taining PDE isozyme inhibitors for 60 min to assure their penetration
into cells or with EGF 10 ng/mi for 10 min. The incubation was termi￾nated by scraping the cells in 0.2 ml of the lysing buffer (27) (final
concentrations): 25 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4) 25 mM NaCl, 80 mM ,/-
glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na Na4P207, 1 mM Na pyrophosphate, 10
mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 ag/mI
leupeptin. The scraped cells were sonicated for 10 sec and then centri￾fuged for 30 min at 15,000 g. The MAPK activity assay was performed
as described (28) with minor modifications. The extract was assayed
in a buffer (final concentrations): 25 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 10 mM
of MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 10 .M of PKA inhibitor
WIPTIDE, 50 mM ATP, 2 jLCi of [32P]--y-ATP and 20 ng of myelin
basic protein (MBP); the mixture (total volume 50 al) contained 10-
20 jig protein extract from MC. The incubation was carried out at 25TC
for 15 min and reaction was stopped by addition of "dissociating
buffer" (final concentration): 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 1% SDS,
10% glycerol, 37.5 mM /3-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol
blue) and boiling for 3 min at 95-100TC. The phosphorylated MBP
was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. The extent of MBP phos￾phorylation was determined by autoradiography; autoradiograms were
evaluated using dual-wavelength flying-spot scanner (Schimadzu densi￾tometer CS 90000). The effects of EGF or PDE isozyme inhibitors
upon MAPK were evaluated as a relative difference of surface area of
peaks from basal value (see Fig. 4). Neither cilostamide nor rolipram
added to the assay mixture interfered with MAPK activity. In control
experiments we determined that overnight incubation of MC with sol￾vent or with drugs or other bioactive agents did not change the appear￾ance of the cells; cells were viable as assessed by trypan blue exclusion.
Likewise, at none of the experimental conditions was there was a leak
of LDH into the medium. In control experiments we determined total
protein content of cells in wells. Protein content was very similar from
well to well (average 50 jig per well) and therefore results of both
[3H]thymidine incorporation or CAMP content are expressed as counts
per sample.
Statistical evaluation of the results. Statistical analysis was per￾formed by two-tailed t test (for group comparison) or by paired t test
as appropriate; relative (A%) differences were evaluated by paired t
test. The values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
PDE activities in MC. The activities of cAMP-PDE and cGMP￾PDE were assayed in extract of MC prepared as described in
Methods. The total cAMP-PDE activity (381±89 pmoles
cAMP/min per mg protein; n = 5) was virtually the same as
total cGMP-PDE activity (385+42 pmoles cGMP/min per mg
protein, n = 4). The presence of five major families (types) of
PDE isozymes in MC was surveyed using characteristic re￾sponses to PDE isozyme-selective synthetic inhibitors (24, 25)
and/or biologic modulators (21-23). The two types of cAMP￾PDE activities detected in extracts from MC were the rolipram￾sensitive PDE-IV and, about two times lower, activity of PDE￾III (Fig. 1, upper panel). No cGMP-stimulated PDE-II or Ca2+ /
CaM-dependent cAMP-PDE, i.e., PDE-I activity hydrolyzing
cAMP, was detected in MC. The failure to detect PDE-I which
hydrolyzes cAMP was not due to the lack of sensitivity of the
PDE assay. As a control, in the same experiments Ca2+/CaM
markedly stimulated (LA% = +95) cAMP-PDE in cytosol from
cultured rat inner medullary duct cells (23). Addition of 5 qM
cGMP resulted in inhibition (- /v% 20±4; n = 3, P < 0.05,
paired t test) of cAMP-PDE, reflecting the presence of PDE￾III and absence of any substantial activity of PDE-II. Unlike in
extract from whole glomeruli (22) or LLCPK1 cells (30) under
none of the assay conditions added 5 OM cGMP increased
cAMP hydrolysis. The arithmetic sum (22) of the rolipram￾inhibitable cAMP-PDE (PDE-IV) and the cilostamide-inhibit￾able cAMP-PDE activity (PDE-III) in extract from MC was
not significantly different from total cAMP-PDE measured in
the presence of Ca2+/CaM in the same experiment (results not
shown). These observations thus indicate that in rat MC the
cAMP is metabolized exclusively by two PDE isozymes: by
PDE-IV and to a lesser degree (- 33%) by PDE-III. With
respect of cGMP-PDE, MC contain about the same activity
of PDE-I which hydrolyzes cGMP and the activity of PDE-V
independent of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 1, lower panel). The determi￾nation of cAMP-PDE separately in the cytosol and in total
membrane fraction (see Methods) showed that majority of both
PDE-HI and PDE-IV activities (- 75%) were contained in cy￾tosolic fraction (data not shown).
Both rolipram and cilostamide showed near maximum in￾hibitory effect of cAMP-PDE at 3 MM and only slightly higher
at 10 ,M. Zardaverine, the "hybrid III/IV inhibitor," reported
to antagonize both isozymes PDE-III and PDE-IV (31), inhib￾ited potently cAMP-PDE in MC extract; the extent of inhibition
of cAMP-PDE in extract from MC by 3 MM zardaverine (A%
- 71+1; mean±SEM, n = 3) was similar to arithmetic sum of
cAMP-PDE inhibition by 3 MM cilostamide (A% - 32±5;
mean±SEM, n = 5) and by 3 MM rolipram (A% - 52±3;
mean±SEM; n = 5), added together (A% - 80±3%;
mean+SEM; n = 3).
Effect of EGF and PDGF upon [3H]thymidine incorpora￾tion into DNA of MC. Incubation with EGF resulted in a dose￾dependent ( 10-12_ 10-6 M EGF) stimulation of mitogenesis in
MC, as determined by [3H] thymidine incorporation assay, with
maximum reached at 3-30 ng/ml EGF and the 1/2 maximum
stimulation was at 0.2 ng/ml EGF. In all subsequent experi￾ments 10 ng/ml EGF was employed as a stimulatory dose;
10 ng/ml EGF enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation fivefold
(A% 541±34; P < 0.01; paired t test n = 12). PDGF also
stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent

added EGF or PDGF.
The MC were incubated either with 10 MM forskolin or

caused about 3-fold greater inhibition of mitogenesis than 3 MM
rolipram (Tables I and II), inspite that PDE-IV activity in MC
is about twofold higher than PDE-Ifl (Fig. 1, upper panel).
Zardaverine at 10 MM was equipotent to 10 1LM cilostamide
(Fig. 2, C and D) but at 3 MM had a lesser effect (Table I).
Neither 10 MM 8-MeoM-IBMX, selective inhibitor of PDE-I
(23, 32), nor zaprinast (10 MM), an antagonist of PDE-V (20,
23), inhibited [3H] thymidine incorporation, either under ambi￾ent conditions or when stimulated with EGF (data not shown).
Structurally unrelated antagonists of PDE-III and PDE-IV
also showed differential inhibitory effect upon [3H] thymidine
incorporation as did cilostamide and rolipram. Antagonist of
PDE-lI (10 MM) cilostazol and PDE-IV antagonist (3 MM)
denbufyllin inhibited cAMP-PDE to the same degree
(-39%±7, n = 7). Yet 10 MM cilostazol reduced [3H]-
thymidine incorporation (A% - 57±3; mean±SEM, n = 3),
fourfold more (P < 0.001; t test) than did 3 MM denbufyl￾line (A% - 14±3; mean±SEM; n = 4). Also, another struc￾turally different potent PDE-Ill inhibitor, 1 MM lixazinone
(33), lowered [3H]thymidine incorporation (A% - 52+4%,
mean±SEM; n = 3), i.e., to a similar extent as 3 MM cilosta￾mide (A% - 60±2, mean±SEM; n = 4).
A combination of cilostamide and rolipram is additive in
blocking mitogenesis (Table II) and this combined effect is
especially pronounced at lower concentrations of these com￾pounds. For example, in the ambient state, 0.3 MuM cilostamide
and 0.3 MM rolipram combined inhibited [3H]thymidine incor￾poration by (A - 51±7%, n = 4), i.e., similarly as 10 4M

these conditions and in the presence of cilostamide alone (Fig.
3)., When H-89, a specific inhibitor of PKA (34), was included
into incubation medium the suppression of mitogenesis in MC
by cilostamide was significantly diminished. In the cells incu￾bated with 3 MM cilostamide and 0.5 MM H-89 the decrease
in [3H]thymidine incorporation (A - 25±8%, mean±SEM; n
= 4) was significantly (P < 0.05; t test) less than with 3 MM
cilostamide alone (A - 48±3%, mean±SEM; n = 4).
Although cilostamide was more than three times more effec￾tive at inhibiting mitogenesis (Fig. 3) than rolipram, in situ
activation of PKA by cilostamide was only slightly higher than
with rolipram (Fig. 3). This comparison rises the possibility
that the actions of PDE-lI and PDE-IV upon cAMP metabolism
in MC may be functionally compartmentalized. Therefore, we
compared effects of cilostamide and rolipram upon cAMP accu￾mulation in MC when cAMP synthesis was enhanced by for￾skolin, a nonspecific stimulator of adenylate cyclase. In the
presence of forskolin rolipram enhanced cAMP accumulation
by 10-100-fold (Table III), whereas cilostamide in equimolar
concentrations barely affected cAMP content (increase about
A + 37%) and this effect was significant only with 3 ,uM
forskolin under ambient conditions (Table III A). Since cilos￾tamide is a much more potent inhibitor of mitogenesis than
rolipram (Tables I and II and Fig. 3) these observations do
suggest a special relationship between cAMP pool metabolized
by PDE-III and regulation of mitogenesis.

Discussion
Present observation that forskolin and B2cAMP inhibit mito￾genesis in MC, as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation
(35, 36), indicates that in MC the negative "crosstalk" (12)
between mitogen-activated protein phosphorylation cascade
pathway and the cAMP-PKA pathways does exist ( 12, 14-17).
The inhibitory input of the activated cAMP-PKA pathway is
very effective since it suppresses [3H] thymidine incorporation
both in the ambient state (Figs. 2 and 3) as well as when MC
are under stimulation of potent mitogens EGF or PDGF. MC,
more than any other resident cell type populating glomerulus
are site of production of growth factors and cytokines (1-4).
Therefore, MC when grown in vitro are most likely exposed to
autocrine/paracrine effects of endogenously synthetized mito￾gens. On the other hand, cells incubated with added high doses
of EGF or PDGF will presumably approximate the situation of
MC in immuno-inflammatory glomerular diseases, when both
stimulated glomerular cells-produce endogenous mitogens at a
higher rate (2-4) and are, in addition, exposed to a large quanta
of cytokines produced by neutrophils and other infiltrating in￾flammatory cells (5).

glomeruli can be activated only by incubation with antagonists
of specific PDE isozyme(s) without stimulation of adenylate
cyclase and without detectable increase of cAMP (22), we
explored whether inhibition of one or more PDE isozymes pres￾ent in MC would sufficiently activate the cognate cAMP-PKA
pathway to elicit "crosstalk" inhibition of the MAPK regula￾tory pathway (12, 14-17). Indeed, a specific antagonists of
PDE-Il, "hybrid" antagonist of PDE-IH and PDE-IV and, to
a much lesser degree antagonists of PDE-IV (Tables I and II)
(Fig. 2, 3) suppressed, in micromolar concentrations, mitogen￾esis of MC, both in the ambient state and when stimulated by
cytokines (Tables I and II).
The pattern of PDE isozymes found in MC differs from
whole rat glomeruli (22) in that PDE-ll, which is abundant in
whole glomeruli is not detectable in MC, and that PDE-IV is
about two times higher than PDE-llI (Fig. 1). Neither in glo￾meruli (22) nor in cultured MC does PDE-I hydrolyze cAMP,
and accepts only cGMP (Fig. 1). Our observation that only
antagonists of PDE-III and PDE-IV, but not inhibitors of other
PDE isozymes suppress [3H]thymidine incorporation is con￾sistent with our analysis of PDE isozymes pattern in MC
(Fig. 1).
The antagonist of PDE-III cilostamide and also PDE-lIh/IV
antagonist zardaverine suppressed [3H] thymidine incorporation
to a similar degree as forskolin or B2cAMP (Fig. 2) but unlike
forskolin, achieved this effect without measurable increases of
cAMP (Table I, Fig. 2). This observation indicates that de￾creased cAMP hydrolysis by isozyme PDE-lI alone, without
stimulation of adenylate cyclase, is sufficient to activate PKA
in situ (Fig. 3) and to inhibit mitogenesis (Tables I and II
and Fig. 3). Inhibition of mitogenesis can be achieved without
increase of cAMP (Table I, Fig. 2 and 3) and this may suggest
that cAMP increases only within a specific compartment of the
MC that is needed for activation of PKA that is required for
inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 3). Evidence
that intracellular cAMP levels are indeed increased in response
to PDE-III inhibitors without detecting change of total cAMP
content is provided by in situ activation of PKA (Fig. 3).
In situ activation of PKA (25) or increased occupancy of its
regulatory subunits (37) are more sensitive indices of enhanced
intracellular cAMP (or its redistribution), than measurement
cAMP content in the cell extracts (22, 25, 37). Our other obser￾vations on cAMP dynamics (Table III) in MC are also consis￾tent with such an interpretation. Although the PDE-IIl isozyme
is much less abundant in MC than PDE-IV (Fig. 1), cilostamide
and other PDE-III inhibitors are severalfold more effective than
PDE-IV inhibition by rolipram or denbufylline in decreasing
[3H]thymidine incorporation by MC (Tables I and II; Fig. 3).
Incubation of MC with cilostamide also activated PKA in situ
to significantly higher degree than with rolipram (Fig. 3). Yet,
when the rate of cAMP synthesis in MC is stimulated by non￾specific agonist forskolin (Table III) effects of the two PDE
isozymes antagonists upon cAMP accumulation were opposite
to their effect upon mitogenesis (Table Ill). This comparison
of disparate effects the two PDE isozyme antagonists have upon
a specific cellular function, i.e., inhibition of mitogenesis, on
one hand (Tables I and II; Fig. 3), and upon overall cAMP
metabolism on the other hand (Table III) does suggest that the
cAMP pool metabolized by PDE-Ill is functionally linked to
regulation of mitogenesis. These findings, suggesting existence
of a PDE-lI-related compartment, are in principle similar to
observations by Manganiello et al. (38) who found that in adi￾pocytes the cilostamide-sensitive PDE-III rather than PDE-IV
is linked to regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes (38, 39). Like￾wise, S. E. Sadler (40) found that only PDE-III inhibitors, but
not inhibitors of PDE-IV, injected to Xenopus laevis oocytes
block the growth-promoting actions of insulin, IGF-I or p2lras
(40). However, it should be also considered that in situ PDE￾IV may have lower affinity for cAMP than PDE-III.
The notion that a specific cAMP pool metabolized by PDE￾III is linked to PKA that inhibits mitogenesis by phosphorylat￾ing Raf-l (14, 16) is also compatible with the finding that a
minor increase of in situ PKA activity by cilostamide resulted
in similar near-maximum inhibition of mitogenesis as the com￾plete PKA activation by forskolin (Fig. 3). The Raf-l protein
408 Matousovic et al.

kinase is inactivated by PKA phosphorylation of Ser43 on the
inner side of the cell membrane (11, 13, 16); conceivably in
intact MC PDE-lI may be situated close to the plasma mem￾brane. In other cell types, for example, it is membrane-bound
PDE-Ill that specifically regulates lipolysis in adipocytes (38,
39), or contractility in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (41); in
hepatocytes, PDE-Il bound to membrane "dense vesicles" is
specifically related to glucagon and insulin actions (42). In
order to detect sometimes fragile association with membrane,
a very gentle cell disruption and fractionation ought to be em￾ployed (43). Thus, the precise localization of PDE-Ill within
MC needs to be determined in future specifically designed
studies.
Stimulation of MAPK activity in MC by EGF affirms the
identity of the assayed protein kinase as MAPK (Fig. 4). Both
under ambient conditions as well as when stimulated by EGF,
PDE isozyme antagonists by decreased MAPK activity (Fig.
4) while PKA activity was significantly increased (Fig. 3).
These findings support the notion that PDE antagonists suppress
[3H]thymidine incorporation via activation of the cAMP-PKA
pathway and by inhibiting the mitogen-activated phosphoryla￾tion cascade upstream to MAPK and ultimately by decreasing
the activity of MAPK (6, 12). While the extent of MAPK
inhibition was relatively modest (Fig. 4), it should be realized
that the employed assay does not distinguish between MAPK
isozymes; the decrease in overall MAPK activities may reflect
more extensive inhibition of one of the MAPK isozymes (10).
PKA was also activated only moderately by PDE inhibitors that
suppressed mitogenesis to the same degree as forskolin, which
activates PKA completely (Fig. 3) and blunts markedly activity
of MAPK in MC (44).
In conclusion, the present study shows that cAMP-PKA
signaling pathway has a suppressive rather than a stimulatory
effect upon MC proliferation and that the mitogen-activated
phosphorylation cascade of these cells is amenable to an indirect
inhibition by selective antagonists of PDE isozyme type III (and
to lesser degree PDE-IV), both in the ambient state and under
stimulation by mitogens. Further, we also show that in micromo￾lar concentrations of a PDE-llI antagonist can activate in situ
PKA without detectable changes in cAMP content (Fig. 3), and
moderate activation of PKA elicits near-maximum inhibition of
mitogenesis, as assessed by [3H] thymidine incorporation. The
pattern of findings points to the possibility that the PDE-1II￾regulated cAMP pool is functionally related to PKA activation,
phosphorylation and decrease in the activity of Raf-l protein
kinase, which ultimately results in decrease of MAPK activity
(Fig. 4).
Previously (22) we found that a specific inhibitor of PDE￾IV rolipram, via activation of PKA, attenuated formation of
reactive oxygen metabolites, another important pathogenic fac￾tor causing glomerular injury. Thus, the results of the present
as well as of our previous study (22) suggest that PDE isozymes
in glomerular cells represent potential novel targets for pharma￾cologic intervention (45) which, by modulation of the signalling
pathways, may block or diminish various types of pathologic
processes in glomeruli.
