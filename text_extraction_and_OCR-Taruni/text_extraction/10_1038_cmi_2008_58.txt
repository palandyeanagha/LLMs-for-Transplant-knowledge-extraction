B cell activating factor belonging to TNF superfamily (BAFF) is a critical regulator of B cell maturation and 
survival. In this present study, the expression characteristic of BAFF in kidney transplantation recipients was 
investigated, its potential significance was analyzed and peripheral blood of follow-up kidney transplant recipients 
was studied. Flow cytometric assay results showed that, cell-surface BAFF was significantly highly expressed on 
peripheral CD3+
 T lymphocytes in ≥ 5 yrs group of kidney transplant recipients, compared with other groups (p < 
0.05). BAFF expression could be found on CD4+
 T cells and CD8+
 T cells. The BAFF mRNA levels in peripheral 
mononuclear cells were consistent with the protein levels. However, serum soluble BAFF levels were inter￾individually different in each group. Stratified by renal function, it was found that cell-surface BAFF levels were 
significantly higher in those with abnormal renal function, compared with recipients with normal renal function (p
< 0.05). ELISA assay results showed that expression levels of cell surface BAFF were significantly correlated with 
anti-HLA I & II antibodies. These results indicate that BAFF may be involved in the development of graft-loss and 
influences the long-time outcome of kidney allograft, likely mediated by interfering with immune response. Cellular 
& Molecular Immunology. 2008;5(6):465-470.

Introduction 
B cell activating factor belonging to TNF superfamily (BAFF, 
CD257), which is also termed BLys, TALL-1, zTNF4, 
THANK and TNFSF13, is a homotrimer, member of the TNF 
superfamily expressed on the cell surface or cleaved and 
secreted (1, 2). BAFF specifically binds to BAFF receptor 
(BAFF-R, also known as BR3) (1, 2), and BAFF can also 
bind to other two receptors, transmembrane activator and 
calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) 
and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), shared with another 
TNF ligand, a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) (1, 2). 
 BAFF is expressed by monocyte-derived cells, such as 
monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and activated T 
lymphocytes, which plays an important role in immune 
response. The discovery of BAFF has shed new light on the 
importance of finely tuned B cell survival for B cell tolerance 
during B cell maturation and activation (3-5). Excessive 
production of BAFF is associated with the development of 
autoimmune diseases, because transgenic (Tg) mice that 
overproduce BAFF develop severe autoimmune disorders 
that resemble systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 
Sjogren’s syndrome (SS) in humans, possibly as a result of 
improper B cell survival, predominantly affecting the 
maturing splenic transitional type 2 (T2) and the marginal 
zone (MZ) B cell populations (5-10). BAFF-induced auto￾immunity in BAFF Tg mice appears to be highly dependent 
on B cells and possibly the production of autoantibodies (11). 
High levels of BAFF have been found in the blood of 
patients with autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE and SS 
(10, 12-15). And BAFF was also found on T lymphocytes 
infiltrating labial salivary glands from patients with SS (16). 
 Now, there are few reports about BAFF and 
transplantation. Sarantopoulos et al. concluded that elevated 
BAFF levels contribute to B cell activation in patients with

active chronic GVHD after having tested whether BAFF 
correlated with chronic GVHD (cGVHD) disease activity 
and time of onset after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (17). Fujii et al. performed a concomitant 
analysis of a number of known and predicted peripheral 
blood cGVHD biomarkers from a Children’s Oncology 
Group (COG) phase III cGVHD therapeutic trial, and found 
that soluble BAFF (sBAFF) was one of four biomarkers with 
high specificity and sensitivity on onset of cGVHD (18). 
 These previous studies indicated that abnormal BAFF 
signaling may be not only involved in autoimmune diseases, 
but also involved in immunopathological course of acute or 
chronic allograft rejection. Immunologically mediated injury, 
including antibody-mediated or cellular-mediated mechanisms, 
is one of the major obstacles to gain long-term acceptance of 
renal allograft with minimal or no immunosuppression. In 
view of special bioactivity of BAFF, experiments have been 
carried through to explore the expression characteristic of 
BAFF and its potential bioactivity in renal allograft rejection, 
and some significant results were obtained.
Materials and Methods 
Specimen collection 
Sixty-nine recipients between Sep 2006 and Jan 2007 were 
studied. During our study, 13 healthy volunteers and 17 
uremia patients treated by dialysis were controls. Peripheral 
blood was obtained from all of transplant patients and 
controls, anticoagulated by EDTA-Na2 at room temperature 
(RT) for fluorescence-activating cell sorting (FACS) analysis 
and real-time reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR); the serum was stored at -20o
C after centrifuged at 
250 g for 10 min for ELISA test. 
Peripheral cell surface BAFF detection 
The phenotypes, such as BAFF, CD3, CD4, and CD8 were 
examined using FACSCalibur (BD). Briefly, phycoerythrin 
(PE) conjugated anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody (eBioscience, 
San Diego, USA) was added into 100 l whole blood 
separately, with or without fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 
conjugated anti-CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14 monoclonal 
antibodies (BD PharMingen, San Diego, USA), mixed, and 
reacted at 4o
C for 45 min. Then cell lysing solution (BD 
Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) was added, mixed 
adequately, and stilled for 15 min. Then all tubes were 
centrifuged at 250 g for 10 min, the supernatant was 
discarded and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added, 
mixed and examined by FACSCalibur. The results were 
analyzed by BD CellQuest software. 
Peripheral BAFF mRNA detection 
The total mRNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) of each volunteer was extracted by an SV Total 
RNA Isolation System kit (Promega, Madison, USA). The 
first-strand cDNA was obtained by using a Reverse 
Transcription System kit (Promega). Oligo 6.0 software 
(Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, USA) was used to 
design primers of BAFF and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Table 1). GAPDH gene 
expression was determined in separate tubes as control for 
the input cDNA. The mRNA levels of BAFF and GAPDH 
were measured by the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master 
SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). 
PCR was carried out in a 20 l reaction mixture containing 2 
l of 10× SYBR green buffer, 0.5 l of 5 U/l Taq, 2 l of 
2.5 mM dNTP, 0.8 l of 25 mM MgCl2, 1 l of both 100 M 
forward and reverse primers, 11.8 l H2O, and 1.2 l of 
cDNA. Thermal cycling conditions included the following 
steps: 95o
C for 5 min to activate Taq polymerase, then 40 
cycles of a three-step PCR was carried out consisting of 15 s 
at 95o
C, 30 s at 56o
C, and 30 s at 72o
C. PCR was carried out 
on a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) and samples were 
amplified simultaneously in duplicate in one assay run. 
Sera sBAFF detection 
sBAFF in serum was tested by using human sBAFF ELISA 
kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendations. 
Sera anti-HLA I & II antibody detection 
Titer of sera anti-HLA I & II antibody (Panel reactive 
antibody, PRA) was detected by Lambda antigen trays-mixed 
(One Lambda, CA, USA), according to instruction provided 
by the manufacturer. The BCIP staining results in each well 
of trays were read by ELX800NB under the wave of 630 nm. 
Statistical analysis 
The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA or Student’s 
t-test method with a statistical software package (SPSS 
version 10.0, SPSS, Chicago, USA). Statistical significance 
was defined as p values less than 0.05. All p values were 
two-sided. 
Results

on CD14+
 monocytes. The expression rate of BAFF on T 
lymphocytes was much higher than that on monocytes. The 
representative figures of BAFF expression on T lymphocytes 
and monocytes were shown as Figure 1.
 To analyze the significance of BAFF expression, patients 
were stratified into three groups according to their 
post-transplant time: < 1 yrs (21 cases), 1-4 yrs (28 cases) 
and ≥ 5 yrs (20 cases). And the statistical results showed that 
BAFF expression was gradually increased accompanied with 
prolongation of transplantation. In ≥ 5 yrs group, mean 
expression rate of BAFF was 27.68%, with statistical 
significance compared to those of the healthy controls and 
uremia dialysis patients (p = 0.002 and 0.004, respectively) 
(Figure 2).
 All patients were also divided into two groups, according 
to their creatinine value: < 144 mol/L group (28 cases) and 
≥ 144 mol/L group (41 cases) (< 144 mol/L is considered 
as normal value). In ≥ 144 mol/L group, the mean 
expression rate of BAFF on CD3+
 T cells was 22.48%, while 
in < 144 mol/L group, the mean expression rate was 13.9% 
(p < 0.05) (Table 2). 
The expression characteristic and statistical analysis of 
BAFF mRNA
The real-time PCR results suggested that BAFF mRNA 
levels were rather weak in PBMC of kidney transplant 
recipients, and significantly increased along with prolongation 
of post-transplant. In 1-4 yrs group and ≥ 5 yrs group, there 
was statistical significance compared to healthy controls and 
uremia dialysis patients (p < 0.01) (Figure 3).
Concentration of sBAFF in serum
sBAFF were interindividually different in each patient of all 
the groups. The concentration of sBAFF was between 30.26- 
2,411.9 pg/ml, and there was no statistical significance 
between the groups (Figure 4). 
Correlation analysis of PRA and BAFF expression level
The titers of PRA of some recipients increased significantly

with the process of post-transplantation, and there was 
statistical significance between BAFF expression level and 
PRA titer (Table 3).
Discussion 
In the present study, FACS results indicated that, cell surface 
BAFF was abnormally highly expressed on peripheral T 
lymphocytes of some kidney transplant recipients, especially 
in those recipients for more than 5 yrs. The real-time PCR 
results showed that BAFF mRNA levels gradually increased 
along with the prolonged transplantation time, and BAFF 
mRNA levels were consistent with BAFF protein levels in 
different groups. 
 Expression of BAFF by T cells has been a controversial 
issue for some time with groups clearly detecting expression, 
particularly in activated cells, while several other studies 
were unable to show significant BAFF. The inadequate 
detection with currently available anti-BAFF monoclonal 
antibodies may have contributed to the relative difficulty in 
establishing BAFF protein production by T cells. Xu et al. 
reported that by using one monoclonal antibody (4F7) 
specially recognized human cell surface BAFF, abnormally 
high expression of BAFF was found on T lymphocytes from 
lung-cancer-associated pleural effusion (19). And Lavie et al. 
found BAFF was expressed in T cells infiltrating labial 
salivary glands from patients with Sjogren’s syndrome by 
immunohistochemistry method with Buffy-2, one rat 
anti-human monoclonal antibody (16). Here the mouse 
anti-human BAFF monoclonal antibody (1D6) was detected 
by FACS. 
 To investigate the correlation of transplant renal function 
and BAFF expression, transplant renal function was stratified 
and these data were statistically analyzed. In abnormal renal 
function group, BAFF was abnormally highly expressed on 
peripheral T lymphocytes, and the expression level was about 
as high as that in ≥ 5 yrs group. And there was statistically 
significant association between anti-HLA I & II antibodies 
level and BAFF expression level. Terasaki et al. analyzed the 
predictive value of anti-HLA antibody and outcome of 
kidney transplant (20), and they also prospectively studied 
the correlation of anti-HLA concentration and serum 
creatinine in chronic rejection (21). They found that increase 
of PRA level predicted the failure of kidney graft. 
 In the present study, the results indicated that BAFF 
expression was correlated with gradually decreasing 
transplant renal function, and BAFF may be involved in 
immune regulating network of kidney transplantation, which 
was the first report about BAFF and kidney transplantation. 
Then how does BAFF signaling act on allograft rejection of 
kidney transplantation? 
 Some researchers found that interaction between BAFF 
and its receptor on T cells enhance human T cell response to 
anti-CD3 activation (22); upon activation T cells produce 
BAFF and up-regulate BAFF-R on the surface. BAFF 
signaling via BAFF-R acts as a costimulator of T cell 
activation, an effect that may result in parting from increased 
basal survival. T cells then differentiate into effective cells 
preferentially producing Th1 cytokines (23). And the BAFF 
on T cells may bind to BCMA on B cells providing more 
survival signal to increase basal survival of B cells, and 
resulting in more production of antibodies (24). Is increase of

anti-HLA I & II antibodies due to high expression of BAFF? 
Does BAFF signaling participate in all T and B cell response? 
And what is the integrated role of BAFF signaling on kidney 
transplant recipients? To further understand the exact 
bioactivity of BAFF in kidney transplant recipients, rat 
kidney transplant model will be established in the lab. 
 Nardelli et al. reported that sBAFF is produced by 
enzymatic processing of the membrane-bound protein by 
conducting experiments with cells transfected with a mutant 
BAFF cDNA (25), as suggested in Schneider’s previous 
report (26). Because the BAFF sequence does not contain a 
predicted signal peptide, a possible mechanism for the 
release of BAFF from the cells is the proteolytic cleavage of 
the membrane-bound protein. However, there is no 
correlation between the levels of cell surface-associated 
BAFF and the concentration of sBAFF found in the cultures 
(25), and the results were in agreement with theirs. In this 
present study, there existed interindividual difference of 
cleaved BAFF levels (serum BAFF levels), and there was no 
statistical significance between different groups. And these 
results were different from observations on GVHD (17, 18). 
Some factors in body fluid may affect the concentration and 
bioactivity of the proteolytic enzyme in kidney transplant 
recipients or stem cell transplant recipients. Further work is 
needed to understand the possible reason of serum BAFF 
formation conditions.
