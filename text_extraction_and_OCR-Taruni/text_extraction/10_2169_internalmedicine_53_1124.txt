Abstract
We herein report the case of a 31-year-old woman who presented with bilateral upper lobe volume loss
and pleural irregularities with hilar retraction. She had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
(BMT) for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia nine years earlier. A surgical lung biopsy showed
pleural thickening and subpleural alveolar collapse and fibrosis, consistent with a diagnosis of pleuroparen￾chymal fibroelastosis (PPFE). Antecedent sicca syndrome and the absence of other causes of fibroelastosis
suggested that these abnormalities were associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). PPFE as
a late, noninfectious complication is rare; however, the present case suggests a new class of BMT-related pul￾monary complications associated with cGVHD.

Introduction
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can lead to a variety
of pulmonary complications (1, 2). Late-onset, noninfectious
pulmonary complications are considered a manifestation of
chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and remain a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality (3).
Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is the most common form of
late-onset, noninfectious pulmonary complications (4-6). Re￾cently, other rare pulmonary complications that have led to
the development of small chronic pneumothoraces or
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) in patients with
BMT have been reported (7, 8). Although BO may be re￾lated to cGVHD, the pathophysiological role of cGVHD in
other pulmonary complications is not fully under￾stood (3, 5).
In this report, we demonstrate unusual pleuroparenchymal
abnormalities as late-onset, noninfectious pulmonary compli￾cations indicating a relationship with cGVHD following al￾logeneic BMT.
Case Report
A 31-year-old woman presented with a complaint of pro￾gressive dyspnea on exertion and a nonproductive cough
lasting for six months. She had no history of smoking or
bronchial asthma. Nine years previously, she had undergone
conventional-intensity allogeneic BMT from an unrelated
donor for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leuke￾mia in a second complete remission. The transplantation was
uncomplicated; however, she had developed oral and oph￾thalmic sicca syndrome over the last six years.
Laboratory tests revealed the following results: KL-6=323
IU/mL (normal <500 IU/mL), SP-A=28.9 ng/mL (normal <
43.8 ng/mL), SP-D=163 ng/mL (normal <110 ng/mL) and a
normal blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. No
anti-SS-A or SS-B antibodies were detected.

Pulmonary function tests revealed the following findings:
a vital capacity (VC) of 1.60 L (56.1% predicted), a forced
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 1.59 L (58.7% pre￾dicted), a FEV1/Forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1%) of
95.8%, a total lung capacity of 2.44 L (63.5% predicted)
and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) of
6.41 mL/min/mmHg (35.7% predicted).
Chest radiography showed marked volume loss and pleu￾ral thickening in the upper lobes with hilar retraction
(Fig. 1A). Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral
pleural irregularities consistent with fibrotic changes extend￾ing into the major fissures (Fig. 1B). Mild traction bron￾chiectasis was also seen in the upper lungs. A gallium-67
scintigram showed no abnormal accumulation in the lungs.
The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic sur￾gery with wedge biopsies of the left upper and lower lobes
(S4 and S6) to evaluate the pulmonary and pleural lesions.
Histopathologically, mild thickening of the visceral pleura
and marked subpleural alveolar collapse and fibrosis charac￾terized by prominent elastic tissue, dense collagen and an
abrupt transition from the lesions to the unaffected lung pa￾renchyma were observed. Partial fibrous obliteration in the
terminal bronchioles and intra-alveolar lymphocytic infiltra￾tion with patchy fibrosis were also detected (Fig. 2A-F).
The patient subsequently developed repeated small, bilat￾eral pneumothoraces (Fig. 3A-C), and the upper lobe vol￾ume loss gradually deteriorated despite the use of systemic
and inhaled corticosteroids.
Discussion
We herein report a case of pleuroparenchymal fibroelasto￾sis followed by BMT, focusing on a new entity of pulmo￾nary complications associated with cGVHD. Recently,
unique radiologic and histopathologic patterns of
pleuroparenchymal abnormalities in patients with BMT
demonstrating pleural and subpleural parenchymal fibrosis
with an upper lobe predominance have been reported (7, 8).
These abnormalities are characterized by chronic, small,
spontaneous pneumothoraces and are histopathologically
consistent with PPFE, which was first described as an idi￾opathic disease (9). The histopathologic features of idi￾opathic PPFE are similar to those of idiopathic pulmonary
upper lobe fibrosis (IPUF), as previously described in the
Japanese literature (10). Although there are some differences
in clinical features among reports (9-11), idiopathic PPFE
and IPUF are essentially the same spectrum of disease.
In the present case, the patient had no history of autoim￾mune disease or asbestos or drug exposure (12) known to
induce such pleuroparenchymal lesions, and no chronic in￾fectious complications were found in the lung specimens.
Although possible causes include thoracic irradiation for
pre-BMT, the pulmonary lesion was associated with cGVHD
followed by sicca syndrome. The diagnosis of sicca syn￾drome was established based on the presence of mild
sialadenitis on a lip biopsy, keratoconjunctivitis on a
Schirmer test and ocular surface staining. Sialadenitis does
not meet the criteria of Sjögren syndrome.
Histopathologically, BO is characterized by peribronchio￾lar fibrosis that leads to luminal narrowing and eventual
obliteration (5). In previous reports of secondary PPFE,
obliteration and fibroblastic plugging have been recognized
in the terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts (8). The pres￾ent patient exhibited similar findings, albeit with more pe￾ripheral lesions than usual BO. In both the present and pre￾vious reports, BO was confirmed in all reported cases using
histopathological examinations, which differs from the find￾ings for idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in the
Japanese literature (11). Coexisting BO is a different pattern
from reported idiopathic PPFE or IPUF and, although
speculative, is a promoting factor of secondary PPFE in
BMT patients.
The spontaneous pneumothoraces and peripheral oblitera￾tive changes observed in the present case may have inter￾acted with each other, possibly through a peripheral check
valve mechanism (7). Progressive subpleural fibrosis and
elastin deposition are attributed to pneumothorax secondary
to obliteration, and these recurrent processes of rupture and
healing of the visceral pleura may develop into PPFE. The
pleural thickening observed in the present case was mild;

however, disease progression can cause pleural thickening
and become more compatible with PPFE.
We thus consider BO, recurrent pneumothorax and PPFE
to be a series of airway diseases associated with cGVHD.
Increased peripheral obliteration causes recurrent pneumo￾thorax and eventually PPFE; however, such small lesions
take a long time for disease progression. Both the present
case and previous reports appear to support a 3- to 24-
month presentation time of BO (3, 5, 6). In contrast, the
presentation time for pneumothorax and PPFE ranges from
two to 16 years (7, 8, 13).
With respect to the BO, systemic and inhaled corticoster￾oids (3) were administered in this case; however, there was
no clinical efficacy. Although the PPFE demonstrated a poor
clinical outcome (8, 10, 11), the therapeutic approach is not
established for either idiopathic or secondary PPFE. It is
clear that late-onset, noninfectious pulmonary complications
are a cause of transplantation-related morbidity and mortal￾ity. With the increasing number of cases of BMT and the
ability to effectively control infectious complications, the

late-onset, noninfectious complications of cGVHD will be￾come more common and long-term follow-up is urgently
needed. Additional reports and studies are required to deter￾mine the importance of this rare pattern of pulmonary com￾plications following BMT.
