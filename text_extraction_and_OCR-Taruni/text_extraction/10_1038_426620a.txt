Abstract
The group of enzymes known as TOR (for 'target of rapamycin')
kinases regulates cell growth and proliferation in response to
nutrients and hormone-dependent mitogenic signals1,2. Here we
show that TOR deficiency in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
more than doubles its natural lifespan. This new function for TOR
signalling in ageing control may represent a link between nutrition,
metabolism and longevity.
