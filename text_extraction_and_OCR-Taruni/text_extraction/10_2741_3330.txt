1. ABSTRACT 
As a result of advances in surgical techniques, 
immunosuppressive therapy, and postoperative 
management, lung transplantation has become an 
established therapeutic option for individuals with a variety 
of end-stage lung diseases. The current 1-year actuarial 
survival rate following lung transplantation is approaching 
80%. However, the 5- year actuarial survival rate has 
remained virtually unchanged at approximately 50% over 
the last 15 years due to the processes of acute and chronic 
lung allograft rejection (1). Clinicians still rely on a vast 
array of immunosuppressive agents to suppress the process 
of graft rejection, but find themselves limited by an 
inescapable therapeutic paradox. Insufficient 
immunosuppression results in graft loss due to rejection, while 
excess immunosuppression results in increased morbidity and 
mortality from opportunistic infections and malignancies. 
Indeed, graft rejection, infection, and malignancy are the three 
principal causes of mortality for the lung transplant recipient. 
One should also keep in mind that graft loss in a lung 
transplant recipient is usually a fatal event, since there is no 
practical means of long-term mechanical support, and since the 
prospects of re-transplantation are low, given the shortage of 
acceptable donor grafts. This chapter reviews the current state 
of immunosuppressive therapy for lung transplantation and 
suggests alternative paradigms for the management of 
future lung transplant recipients.

2. INTRODUCTION 
At the turn of the last century, the rejection of 
solid-organ allografts was generally believed to result from 
‘malnutrition’ of the graft, perhaps related to an inadequacy 
of its blood supply. It was not until the pioneering work of 
physicians such as Karl Landsteiner, Alexis Carrel, and 
Charles Guthrie that an immunologic basis for graft 
rejection was hypothesized. In his 1912 Nobel Address, 
Carrel aptly summarized the challenge to be met so that 
organ transplantation could become a clinical reality: 
“…the power of the organism to eliminate foreign tissue 
was due to organs such as the spleen or bone marrow…all 
our efforts must now be directed toward the biological 
methods which will prevent the response of the organism 
against foreign tissue…” 
 Despite this prescient observation, it was almost a 
half of a century later before azathioprine (AZA), a 
derivative of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), became the first 
immunosuppressive agent to be in widespread clinical use. 
The introduction of AZA, along with corticosteroids, 
finally pushed the field of transplantation beyond renal 
transplantation between monozygotic twins. 
 In the early 1980s, the advent of cyclosporine A 
(CsA), the first maintenance immunosuppressive drug with 
T-cell specificity, allowed renal transplantation to be 
performed with clinical reliability, thus enabling thoracic 
organ transplantation to move out of the experimental 
arena. Current immunosuppressive management in lung 
transplantation still relies on AZA, CsA, and related 
compounds, although a number of novel agents are now 
entering clinical practice. 
 In this chapter, the current state of 
immunosuppressive therapy for lung transplantation will be 
examined in light of our increased understanding of the 
mechanisms that underlie graft rejection. Ultimately, 
however, the field of transplantation will need to undergo a 
paradigm shift away from traditional pharmacologic 
immunosuppression, if we are to circumvent the inevitable 
conflict that exists between the risks of excess 
immunosuppression and the consequences inadequate 
therapy. 
3. MODES OF GRAFT REJECTION 
 
Graft rejection has historically been classified 
into hyperacute rejection (HAR), acute rejection (AR), and 
chronic rejection (CR). 
3.1. Hyperacute rejection 
HAR is an uncommon form of rejection that 
occurs when a recipient has preformed antibodies to 
antigens present on the donor tissue (alloantigen). From a 
clinical standpoint, HAR is only encountered when a solid 
organ graft is inadvertently transplanted across an ABO 
blood group barrier or when the recipient has been 
sensitized to alloantigen from previous exposures to blood 
products, past pregnancies, or a failed transplant. Because 
HAR is driven by preformed antibodies, HAR occurs 
within minutes of reperfusion. The principal pathologic 
manifestation of HAR is hemorrhage and thrombosis 
within the graft, as antibodies fix complement resulting in 
an acute loss of vascular integrity. The clinical approach to 
this problem is based on prevention through appropriate 
donor-recipient matching, although under unusual 
circumstances, techniques such as plasma exchange, 
rituximab (an anti-B-cell agent) and splenectomy may be 
employed. 
3.2. Acute rejection 
AR is a ubiquitous form of graft rejection that 
occurs primarily due to the development of a robust T-cell 
response of the recipient to the graft. In the absence of 
immunosuppression, most grafts would succumb to AR 
within a matter of days to weeks. The principal 
histologic manifestation of AR is the presence of 
perivascular and intraparenchymal mononuclear cellular 
infiltrates. Over the past quarter of a century, 
considerable progress has been made in the prevention 
and treatment of AR, primarily through the use of 
immunosuppressive drugs. As discussed below, AR is 
to a great extent a time-limited phenomenon, which 
occurs primarily in the first post-transplant year. 
Advances in the treatment of AR, as well as 
improvements in surgical technique and post-operative 
management, are mainly responsible for the reduction in 
early mortality that has been observed over time (Figure 
1). 
3.3.Chronic rejection 
Chronic rejection (CR) is the biggest obstacle to 
successful lung transplantation. The process of CR, 
regardless of the organ involved, is histologically 
characterized by a fibrotic replacement of the organ 
parenchyma as the final common pathway following a 
repeated sequence of immune and non-immune injury and 
inflammation. Gradually over time, these repeated insults 
to the graft lead to an exhaustion of beneficial repair 
mechanisms, ultimately resulting in fibrosis. This fibrotic 
scarring seems to have a predilection for narrowing and 
obliterating the endothelial- and epithelial-lined tubular 
structures in a graft. 
The principal manifestation of CR in the lung is a 
pathological entity known as obliterative bronchiolitis 
(OB). Over half of all lung transplant recipients develop OB 
within 5 years of transplantation, and OB is currently the 
leading cause of graft loss and mortality after the first post￾transplant year (1, 2). Pathologically, OB is a 
concentric fibrosis of the membranous and respiratory 
bronchioles that results in an obstructive defect to airflow (3). 
In chronically rejecting lung allografts, this fibrosis can also 
extend into the peribronchiolar interstitium and may 
involve the pulmonary vasculature in a process similar to 
cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Owing to the limited quantity 
of tissue that can be retrieved by bronchoscopy, the clinical 
diagnosis of OB and chronic lung rejection is often made by 
identifying the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), 
characterized by progressive limitation in spirometric 
airflow (4) and by correlative radiographic findings (5).

Unfortunately, CR is clearly a multifactorial 
disease, and the immunologic mechanisms underlying its 
development are still poorly understood. If one examines 
the slopes of the survival curves in Figure 1 after the first 
post-transplant year, it becomes apparent that very few 
strides have been made in addressing the problem of CR, 
which is the principal contributor to the 6% annual fall-off 
in survival of lung transplant recipients (1). 
4. MECHANISMS OF GRAFT REJECTION 
 The CD4+ T cell plays a pivotal role in 
orchestrating the immune response to an allograft. These 
helper T lymphocytes direct the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ 
T cells and support the B lymphocyte in the production of 
alloantibody that can fix complement and mediate 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. CD4+ T-cell 
activation also initiates a plethora of immunologic events 
that lead to the production of a variety of cytokines and 
chemokines, which can either be injurious or beneficial to 
the graft. Over the last decade, significant progress has 
been made in understanding the pathways by which 
alloreactive T cells recognize foreign antigen and become 
activated. 
4.1. Alloantigen recognition 
Two recognition pathways (which are not 
mutually exclusive) have been described: direct 
allorecognition and indirect allorecognition (6). Direct 
allorecognition occurs when the recipient’s CD4+ T cell 
recognizes intact donor major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) molecules on antigen presenting cells (APCs) of 
donor origin. This mode of allorecognition has long been 
the focus of transplantation immunology, and appears to be 
particularly relevant to the process of AR. In the 
immediate post-transplant period, there are many viable 
donor APCs in the graft, available for direct recognition by 
recipient T cells. These donor APCs (expressing allogeneic 
MHC class II antigens) and the high precursor frequency of 
recipient T cells capable of recognizing allo-MHC 
molecules without the requirement of priming make the 
direct alloresponse the dominant mode of immune 
recognition underlying AR (7). In fact, in a recent murine 
study where donor-type APCs were replaced by recipient￾type APCs by bone marrow transplantation prior to 
allografting, AR was markedly attenuated, while CR 
persisted (8). 
Over time, a downregulation of the direct 
alloresponse occurs as the population of donor APCs 
residing in and emigrating from the graft diminishes, 
leading to a diminution in the incidence and severity of AR. 
At this point, the other pathway of T-cell activation, 
indirect allorecognition, becomes dominant (9). Indirect 
allorecognition occurs when recipient APCs processes 
alloantigens in the conventional manner, and the resultant 
peptide fragments are presented to recipient CD4+ T cells 
in the context of self-MHC molecules. Because the T-cell 
precursor frequency for indirectly recognized allopeptides 
is several orders of magnitude less than that for directly 
recognized MHC antigens, the indirect immune response 
represents a more indolent immune reaction, consistent 
with the natural history of CR. However, because virtually 
all of the parenchymal cells of an allograft can serve as 
substrate for antigen processing by recipient APCs, indirect 
allorecognition is an ever-present mechanism in the long￾term alloresponse of a host to a graft. 
It is only in the last several years that scientists 
and clinicians have begun to appreciate the critical role that 
indirect allorecognition plays in the pathogenesis of CR. 
The first experimental evidence that indirect 
allorecognition was sufficient to mediate graft rejection 
came from studies of skin grafting between MHC class I￾and class II-knockout mice in which the skin grafts were 
rejected in an experimental construct where direct

allorecognition was not operative (10). Analysis of 
lymphocytes extracted from recipient nodal tissue in these 
experimental constructs confirmed the presence of a small 
population of self-restricted T lymphocytes that were able 
to respond to donor-derived peptides (11). More recent 
experimental studies have shown that pre-transplant 
immunization with donor-derived MHC allopeptides can 
accelerate heart and lung allograft rejection and 
vasculopathy in both murine (12 - 14) and porcine systems 
(15, 16). In the clinical arena, many investigators have 
demonstrated a positive correlation between T-cell 
reactivity to synthetic allopeptides derived from the donor 
MHC and chronic graft rejection and dysfunction. This 
general finding has been seen in recipients of renal (17-19), 
heart (20), and most recently lung allografts (21). 
4.2. Generation of an immune response 
In 1970, Bretscher and Cohn proposed a multi￾signal model of lymphocyte activation (22). This model 
was originally described in terms of B lymphocyte 
activation, but later evolved to describe the activation of T 
cells as well. In the context of organ transplantation, 
lymphocyte activation first requires the recognition of 
foreign antigen via one of the modes of allorecognition 
discussed above. The binding of the T-cell receptor (TCR) 
with foreign antigen presented in the context of MHC 
molecules is commonly referred to as ‘Signal 1’. Next, a 
variety of complementary molecules expressed on the APC 
and the T cell must associate. This process (‘Signal 2’) is 
more commonly known by the term ‘costimulation’ (23). 
Finally, a third stimulus (‘Signal 3’) for full immune 
activation is provided by the induction of stimulatory 
cytokines (principally interleukin-2 [IL-2]), which act in 
both autocrine and paracrine fashions to promote the clonal 
expansion and differentiation of T cells specific for the 
alloantigen that was encountered. 
Following immune activation, AR and CR 
rejection proceed through a variety of redundant effector 
mechanisms. Activated dendritic cells secrete IL-2 and 
other pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn promote 
the differentiation of CD8+ T cells into cytotoxic 
lymphocytes. IL-2 also promotes the differentiation of 
CD4+ T cells into a pro-inflammatory (Th1) phenotype that 
is capable of recruiting and inducing a variety of other 
immune effector cells and supporting the production of 
alloantibody. These events ultimately lead to the 
chemoattraction and activation of macrophages, natural 
killer cells, and the production of alloantibody. 
Currently, the majority of immunosuppressive 
regimens in clinical use exert their effect either 1) by 
blocking the pathways involved in the clonal expansion of 
alloreactive T cells, or 2) by cytoreducing the T-cell 
population, so as to reduce the intensity of the immune 
response. 
5. CURRENT IMMUNOSUPPRESIVE STRATEGIES 
Immunosuppression for lung transplantation can 
be considered under three clinical contexts: 1) maintenance 
immunosuppression, 2) induction therapy, and 3) anti￾rejection treatment. 
5.1. Maintenance immunosuppression 
 While there has been some recent interest in 
identifying that small subset of patients who become 
tolerant to their graft, the vast majority of thoracic organ 
transplant recipients are maintained on life-long 
pharmacologic immunosuppression. For almost two 
decades, triple-drug therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor 
(CNI), an antimetabolite, and a corticosteroid has been the 
standard of care in maintenance immunosuppression. Like 
most other multi-drug regimens, the clinician’s intent is to 
take advantage of drug synergies, while limiting the 
toxicity of any single agent. Each of the components of 
standard triple-drug therapy will be considered in turn 
below. 
5.1.1. Calcineurin inhibitors 
Currently, two CNIs are in clinical use, CsA and 
tacrolimus (TAC). CsA is a cyclic polypeptide derived 
from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, and exerts its 
effects by interfering with IL-2 gene transcription, thereby 
limiting the clonal expansion of activated T cells. CsA was 
approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1983, and gained 
widespread acceptance following strikingly positive results 
in several clinical trials in renal transplantation. In 
particular, CsA dramatically decreased the incidence of 
AR, without the myelosuppressive properties of other 
existing agents. 
TAC (also known as FK506) is a macrolide 
antibiotic that differs structurally from CsA, but has a 
mechanism of action that is quite similar to that of CsA. 
TAC entered clinical use in 1995, and has been shown to be 
more effective than CsA in reducing AR in renal allografts 
(24-27). In the arena of lung transplantation, TAC became 
the preferred CNI in the year 2000, based on data from the 
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) (28). 
Currently, TAC accounts for 70% of all CNI-based 
maintenance immunosuppression, both at discharge and at 
3 years post-transplant (28). This preference for TAC is 
supported by the extrapolation of data from other solid￾organ transplants, and is at least not refuted by interim 
results from a prospective two-center European trial 
comparing the efficacy of CsA and TAC, when used in 
conjunction with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (29). 
 Despite a growing clinical preference for the use 
of tacrolimus in maintenance therapy for lung transplant 
recipients, there has been renewed interest in utilizing 
cyclosporine as an inhalational agent. The obvious 
theoretical advantage of this approach is that it should be 
possible to achieve high intragraft levels of 
immunosuppression without significant systemic side 
effects. In a recent single-center, double-blind, placebo￾controlled trial, inhaled cyclosporine did not reduce the rate 
of acute rejection, but it did improve survival and extend 
periods of chronic rejection–free survival (30). Similar 
studies involving the safety and efficacy of inhaled 
tacrolimus are currently underway.

5.1.2 Antimetabolites 
Antimetabolites have also been a mainstay of 
maintenance immunosuppression since the early days of 
transplantation, when 6-MP was brought into clinical use. 
Currently, two nucleotide analogs are in common clinical 
use, AZA and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). 
 Murray and colleagues brought AZA into the 
clinical arena, which has a greater margin of safety than 6-
MP, into clinical use in 1963 (31). AZA undergoes in vivo 
reduction to 6-MP, which is able to inhibit both RNA and 
DNA synthesis, leading to a decrease in the proliferation of 
reactive immune cells. Multiple studies have shown that 
AZA has potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive 
effects, and is especially useful in blunting AR when given 
in conjunction with a CNI. 
MMF, the morpholinoethyl ester of 
mycophenolic acid, is a pro-drug that is rapidly converted 
by plasma esterases into mycophenolic acid after oral 
administration. It overtook AZA in clinical usage in 2000, 
based on SRTR data (28). MMF inhibits the proliferation 
of T- and B cells, and the production of antibody (32). The 
positive effect of MMF on early renal allograft rejection 
has been demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind 
clinical trials (33-35). All three studies revealed that MMF 
lowered the incidence of acute rejection at six months by 
approximately 50 percent. However, three years after 
transplantation, only a limited beneficial effect of MMF on 
graft survival was observed in these trials. Using data from 
the U.S. Renal Transplant Scientific Registry, Ojo and 
colleagues showed that MMF significantly reduced the 
incidence of chronic allograft failure in renal 
transplantation (36). The retrospective analysis on renal 
transplant recipients, who were either treated with MMF 
(n=8,435) or with azathioprine (n=48,436), demonstrated 
that the incidence of chronic allograft failure was reduced 
by 27% (risk ratio 0,73, P<0.001), and this effect appeared 
to be unrelated to the effect on acute rejection (36). This 
latter result is in agreement with experimental data from 
rodent studies indicating that MMF prevents chronic 
rejection (37). MMF, in combination with sirolimus (SRL), 
has recently been shown to attenuate the progression of 
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in lung transplant 
recipients with established OB following conversion from 
CNI-based immunosuppression (38). 
5.1.3. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors 
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
inhibitors that are in clinical use include sirolimus (SRL) 
and everolimus (ERL). This new class of drugs acts by 
interfering with T-cell proliferation by blocking a kinase 
causing cell cycle arrest (39, 40). As such, these new agents 
have found utility in replacing the traditional 
antimetabolites (AZA and MMF) in triple-drug regimens. 
It has been shown in heart transplant recipients that 
treatment with cyclosporine and everolimus resulted in 
significantly less CR at 12 months, compared to treatment 
with cyclosporine and azathioprine (41). This combination 
of cyclosporine and everolimus has been recently shown in 
a randomized double blind clinical trial to significantly 
slow the loss of lung function in lung transplant recipients 
at 1 year (42). In another randomized trial, rapamycin was 
shown to halt progression of established and severe CR in 
heart transplant patients, resulting in fewer adverse cardiac 
events over a two-year span (43). More recently, in a multi￾center, prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 
everolimus was compared to mycophenolate mofetil in the 
context of triple-drug maintenance therapy after lung 
transplantation. At 12 months, the everolimus-treated 
group had a lower incidence of pulmonary function 
decrements, BOS, and acute rejection. However, at 24 
months, only the incidence of acute rejection remained 
significantly less in the everolimus group (44). Longer 
follow-up and confirmation of these results will be 
forthcoming. 
5.1.4. Corticosteroids 
Corticosteroids have been in clinical use for 
almost 80 years. In the area of solid organ transplantation, 
steroids exert a variety of anti-inflammatory and 
immunosuppressive effects. Cytosolic corticosteroid 
receptors are expressed ubiquitously, and their 
translocation to the nucleus results in the interruption of 
multiple steps in the presentation of antigen, the production 
of cytokines, and the initiation of a proliferative response. 
Pharmacologic doses of steroids also have a redistribution 
effect on circulating lymphocytes and monocytes, causing 
them to be sequestered into lymph nodes and secondary 
lymphoid organs. The resulting cytopenic state greatly 
decreases the extent to which circulating lymphocytes 
encounter alloantigen. Steroids also reduce the production 
of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators, which 
otherwise would enhance the recruitment of immune 
effector cells to the graft and up-regulate the expression of 
alloantigen and costimulatory molecules. 
Nearly all lung transplant recipients (98-100%, 
based on SRTR data [28]) are maintained on some level of 
steroid therapy. However, in renal allografting, there has 
been considerable interest in steroid reduction and steroid 
withdrawal, typically beginning in the middle of the first 
post-transplant year. Often the early withdrawal of steroids 
in renal recipients has been in association with the use of 
polyclonal or monoclonal anti-lymphocyte antibody 
induction therapy. Aggressive steroid withdrawal has not 
been broadly attempted in the field of thoracic 
transplantation, where the consequences of graft loss are 
dire. Nonetheless, steroid withdrawal has been 
successfully achieved in a number of cardiac allograft 
recipients, although it is difficult to determine a priori who 
will benefit from such an attempt (45). 
. Steroid avoidance, at least up to 2 years, was 
achieved in a group of lung transplant recipients that had 
induction therapy with ATG or Campath-1H (humanized 
anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody) followed by minimal 
post-transplant immunosuppression with tacrolimus 
monotherapy or near monotherapy (46). 
 Maintenance immunosuppression for lung 
transplantation at discharge has evolved over the last 10 
years with TAC/MMF combination with corticosteroids 
being the most common regimen having taken over from

antimetabolites. 
CsA/AZA combination (28) (Figure 2). This pattern is 
maintained up to 3 years post-transplant (Figure 3). 
5.2. Induction therapy 
Induction agents consist of several classes of 
antibodies that exhibit protective effects (principally from 
AR) when administered in the peri-transplant period. 
Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-T-cell antibodies have 
existed throughout the modern era of solid-organ 
transplantation, and exert their effect principally by 
cytoreducing alloreactive T-cells at a time when there is a 
high passenger (donor) leukocyte (APCs) load. The long￾term utility of these cytolytic agents is limited by the 
tendency of patients to develop neutralizing antibodies to 
these animal-derived proteins. More recently, several anti￾IL2 receptor antibodies, which inhibit IL-2 mediated T-cell 
proliferation, have been approved for clinical use. Over the 
past decade, there has been a tremendous increase in use of 
induction therapies. Currently, approximately half of all 
lung transplant centers routinely use some form of 
induction therapy, with anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies and 
polyclonal antibodies being the agents of choice (28) 
(Figure 4). 
5.2.1. Polyclonal antibodies 
 Polyclonal antibodies are derived from animals 
that have been immunized with human lymphocytes. 
Currently, two preparations (an equine anti-thymocyte 
globulin (ATG) and a rabbit-derived ATG) are available for 
clinical use. Polyclonal antibodies have the dual action of 
depleting circulating T cells and modulating the expression 
of cell surface receptors in a manner that renders the T cell 
inert. These agents are generally well tolerated on 
administration, with the exception of some febrile 
reactions. However, these antibodies have a low specificity 
to the immunizing antigen (the T lymphocyte), and 
therefore can have immnosuppressive and leukopenic 
effects in excess of what are clinically desired. Patients 
receiving polyclonal antibodies are also at a slightly higher 
risk of infections and malignancies due to decreased 
immune surveillance. 
5.2.2. Monoclonal antibodies 
Monoclonal antibodies are derived from the 
fusion of a murine myeloma cell with an antibody￾producing B cell to create an immortalized hybridoma cell 
line that produces an antibody with a single specificity. At 
present, muromonab CD-3 (OKT3) is the only classic 
monoclonal antibody in clinical use, and its initial 
popularity is waning rapidly. The principal drawback of 
OKT3 is its propensity to cause a ‘cytokine release 
syndrome’ upon initial administration. This syndrome is 
characterized by the presence of a systemic inflammatory 
state with an attendant loss of capillary integrity. The 
cytokine release syndrome is particularly troublesome in 
pulmonary transplantation, where the allografted lungs 
have already been injured to some degree by ischemia and 
reperfusion. Like all animal-derived antibodies, OKT3 is 
recognized as a foreign protein by the host immune system, 
which can respond with the formation of neutralizing

antibodies that can lead to serum sickness and make 
prolonged or repeated administration ineffective. 
5.2.3. Interleukin-2 blocking antibodies 
 Two new anti-interleukin(IL)-2 receptor 
antibodies are also available for clinical use, daclizumab 
and basiliximab. Like several other immunosuppressive 
drugs, these antibodies inhibit T-cell proliferation by 
blocking the autocrine and paracrine actions of the IL-2 
signal. These monoclonal antibodies also are similar in that 
much of their murine protein structures have been replaced 
with human amino acid sequences through genetic 
engineering. This greatly reduces the antigenicity of these 
antibodies, extending their pharmacologic half-lives, and 
preserving their efficacy on repeat administration. Both of 
these agents have been shown to reduce AR in large studies 
of renal allografting (47). On the contrary, a recent 
retrospective analysis of 335 lung transplant patients from a 
single center, comparing anti-thymocyte globulin with 
daclizumab as induction therapy agent demonstrated ATG 
induction to be superior to daclizumab induction in the 
reduction in the incidence and severity of acute cellular 
rejection (48). 
5.3. Anti-rejection treatment 
5.3.1. Acute rejection 
The treatment of suspected or confirmed episodes 
of AR is generally one of intensification of 
immunosuppression. In addition to optimizing CNI levels 
and antimetabolite therapy, most clinicians will treat AR 
initially with a ‘steroid pulse’ typically consisting of three 
days of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (i.e.,
methyprednisolone), followed by a slow steroid taper back 
to previous levels with close clinical monitoring. 
Refractory AR is typically treated with the use of induction 
agents, with IL-2 receptor antibodies and rabbit-derived 
ATG being the most common choices. Other less common 
approaches to treating refractory AR include the use of 
total lymphoid irradiation and photopheresis. 
5.3.2. Chronic rejection 
The treatment of CR in lung transplantation 
remains the greatest challenge to the field. As mentioned 
earlier, much clinical success has been made in the 
prevention and treatment of AR, but little progress has been 
made in the treatment of CR. While an immune disparity is 
the sine qua non of CR, we now know that a large number 
of antigen-independent, i.e. non-immunologic factors can 
exacerbate CR (Table 1). In fact, the multifactorial nature 
of CR is the principal reason that CR has been so refractory 
to treatment. The scant progress that has been made in the 
treatment of CR, unfortunately, has focused on the 
prevention of vasculopathy, which is not the dominant 
clinical manifestation of CR in the lung. It remains to be 
seen whether treatments that reduce vasculopathy and 
parenchymal scarring in other solid-organ allografts will 
have a similar effect on OB. 
When faced with CR in the lung transplant 
recipient, most clinicians attempt to both intensify and 
modify the patient’s immunosuppression regimen (59). For 
patients maintained on older drugs (e.g., AZA and CsA), 
this may entail switching to TAC and/or MMF. Several 
small studies have shown stabilization of CR with such 
changes (38, 60). However, these studies suffer from a 
lack of prospective control; and the transient stabilization 
of lung function typically observed might be the result of 
intensified medical care in general, rather than being 
attributable to a single pharmacologic manipulation. 
A variety of other experimental agents in the 
treatment of CR are currently under investigation in a 
number of animal models (Table 2). While these agents 
may hold some clinical promise, it is more likely that CR 
will remain a persistent problem until the immunologic 
basis of CR can be circumvented. 
6. CHANGING THE PARADIGM OF 
IMMUNOSUPPRSIVE THERAPY 
While it is likely that there will continue to be 
small incremental advances in pharmacologic 
immunosuppressive therapy, immunosuppression in the 
classic sense will always render the patient at risk for AR, 
CR, opportunistic infection, and malignancy. In the long 
run, success in organ transplantation is likely to be

dependent on our ability to achieve a state of 
transplantation tolerance. Transplantation tolerance can be 
defined as the stable long-term engraftment of an organ in 
the absence of immunosuppression in a recipient who 
remains otherwise immunocompetent. Depending on 
whether tolerance is induced inside or outside the thymus, 
these mechanisms are further divided in central and 
peripheral, respectively (73). 
6.1. Central tolerance 
As compared to the immune response to 
conventional antigens, where the fraction of reactive T cells 
is approximately 1/105
 to 1/106 of the total T-lymphocyte 
pool, approximately 7% of all T cells can respond to the 
direct presentation of alloantigen (74). This difference in 
T-cell precursor frequency suggests that mechanisms 
sufficient to regulate normal immune function and prevent 
pathologic autoimmune responses may be insufficient to 
control the quantitatively larger alloimmune response. 
Consequently, it is now widely believed that achieving 
robust central deletional tolerance (where allogeneic 
dendritic cells residing in the host thymus help to 
negatively select alloreactive T cells) will be a critical 
component in any strategy to induce transplantation 
tolerance. 
The full application of this mechanism to 
transplantation depends on the ability to achieve stable 
mixed-chimerism in a host, which has been 
accomplished in a variety of rodent (75) and swine (76, 
77) models. However, recent studies in non-human 
primates have shown that transient thymic chimerism 
may afford an immunologic window during which 
tolerance can be achieved (78, 79). The principal 
impediments to the widespread clinical use of this 
technique include 1) the toxicity of the conditioning 
regimens necessary to prepare the recipient for 
engraftment, and 2) the risk of inducing graft-versus-host 
disease and hematologic malignancies (80). 
Nonetheless, this strategy has already enjoyed limited 
clinical success in selected patients (81, 82). 
6.2. Peripheral tolerance 
Peripheral tolerance includes mechanisms such as 
anergy, regulation (suppression), and peripheral deletion, 
either through passive cell death or apoptotic activation￾induced cell death (83). As discussed previously, full T￾cell activation requires both a primary signal from the 
engagement of the TCR and a second signal that arises 
from the interaction of a variety of costimulatory 
molecules. If TCR engagement is present without a 
concomitant costimulatory signal, the T cell can become 
specifically non-reactive (anergic) (84) or undergo 
programmed cells death consequent to cytokine 
withdrawal (85). Recent data has shown that selective 
blockade of these costimulatory signals, using either 
CTLA4Ig (a fusion protein of CTLA-4 and human Ig that 
competitively binds CD80 and CD86) or a blocking 
monoclonal antibody to CD154, can induce a state of 
peripheral tolerance through mechanisms that involve 
anergy, deletion, and regulation in rodent models of 
cardiac, hepatic, islet, renal, bone marrow and skin 
transplantation (86 - 95). 
Recent interest has also been shown in the role of 
dendritic cells (DCs) in the induction of peripheral 
tolerance. DCs are responsible for priming and 
maintaining both direct and indirect alloresponses. New 
research suggests that the immunostimulatory properties of 
DCs are linked to their state of maturation, and that 
immature or tolerogenic DCs can induce peripheral 
tolerance by the induction of regulatory T cells (96, 97) and 
this provide the basis for targeting or using these cells to 
promote tolerance to bone marrow transplants or organ 
allograft (98-100). Moreover, many anti-inflammatory or 
immunosuppressive drugs commonly used in 
transplantation, inhibit the maturation of DCs and 
potentiate their tolerogenicity (101). Plasmatoid DCs 
represent a recently characterized DC subset, the precursor 
of which can enhance allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
engraftment and promote donor-specific tolerance to skin 
grafts in mice (102). This ability to tolerize the indirect 
pathway may be particularly important for the prevention 
of chronic rejection.

1635
Figure 4. Trends in induction immunosuppression for lung transplantation, 1995 – 2004.
Finally, there has been recent interest in another 
peripheral mechanism of tolerance known as immunologic 
ignorance. Typically, the process of allorecognition occurs 
in secondary lymphoid organs (such as regional lymph 
nodes, the spleen, and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue) 
after an antigen is processed by an APC and transported to 
these sites. When an antigen-specific T cell encounters the 
relevant alloantigen outside this environment, the 
alloantigen may be ignored (103). This phenomenon 
suggests that agents that interfere with lymphocyte 
tracking, such as FTY720 (72), may also hold clinical 
promise. 
7. BARRIERS TO TRANSPLANTATION 
TOLERANCE 
7.1. Homeostatic proliferation 
 The depletional strategies increasingly used for 
induction immunosuppression are known to dramatically 
alter the circulating lymphocyte population for prolonged 
periods of time. There is evidence that, upon reconstitution 
of the lymphocyte compartment, an inverse CD4:CD8 ratio 
develops and persists for many years (104). The phenotype 
of these cells appears to be that of memory rather than 
naïve cells. A key feature of memory T cells is that their 
threshold of activation is lower and they utilize different 
costimulatory pathways for functional activation than naïve 
T cells. Hence these alloreactive memory T cells are 
resistant to standard immunosuppression and represent the 
major barrier to transplantation tolerance in humans. 
7.2. Inhibition of regulatory T cells (Treg) 
 In most rodent models of transplant tolerance, 
except mixed chimerism, there is strong evidence that Treg 
cells play an important role. Their identification in tolerated 
skin allograft or vascularized organ allografts suggests that 
these Treg cells function locally to suppress anti-allograft 
responses (105). Normally, Treg cells respond to antigenic 
stimulation by inhibiting the proliferation of naïve antigen 
specific cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or elaboration of 
soluble factors. Generation of donor-specific regulatory 
cells requires that lymphocyte activation occur in an 
appropriate, conducive milieu. Most immunosuppressive 
agents inhibit T-cell activation and therefore may 
simultaneously inhibit the generation of regulatory T cells. 
Experimental work has shown that calcineurin inhibitors 
diminish or abrogate regulatory activity, whereas mTOR 
inhibitors do not (106,107). 
7.3. Antibody-mediated rejection 
 The traditional focus of immunosuppression has 
been to control activation and proliferation of T cells. Ever 
since crossmatching protocols largely eliminated 
hyperacute rejection, antibody-mediated processes driven 
by B cells were considered to be infrequent and 
unimportant. Recently, however, it has become known that 
antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a frequent 
component of acute cellular rejection and, less frequently, 
can occur independently. 
The target of AMR for all transplanted organs is 
thought to be endothelial cells, but the histological picture 
varies with the transplanted organ (108). Recipients of 
kidney and heart allograft have the highest incidence of 
documented AMR. The most reliable histological finding 
of AMR is demonstration of C4d deposition in capillary 
endothelium (109). 
7.4. Natural killer cells 
 Natural killer (NK) cells are a primary 
component of the innate immune response and, therefore, 
do not require prior antigen exposure or sensitization to 
antigen in order to activate. It is thought that self-MHC 
antigens prevent NK-cell activation, while the absence of 
‘self’ MHC promotes activation. Teleologically, this 
mechanism was intended to protect against infectious 
agents. Consequently, the transplant setting might represent 
a constant and powerful stimulus for NK-cell activation. 
NK-cell activation and elaboration of cytokines have been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic allograft damage

in a variety of solid organs (110). Inhibition of the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may mitigate the 
development of these conditions (111). 
8. CONCLUSION 
 While we are likely to see continued incremental 
advances in pharmacologic immunosuppression, it is 
important to realize that the problem of graft rejection will 
not be fully solved by approaches that lack antigenic 
specificity. Our ability to control and direct the immune 
response is dependent upon the development of a 
mechanistic understanding of the pathways of rejection and 
tolerance. Ultimately, the achievement of transplantation 
tolerance will begin a new era in organ transplantation.
