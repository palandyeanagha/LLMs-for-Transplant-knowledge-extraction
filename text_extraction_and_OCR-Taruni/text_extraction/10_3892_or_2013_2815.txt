Abstract. Ginsenosides, extracted from the traditional 
Chinese herb ginseng, are a series of novel natural anticancer 
products known for their favorable safety and efficacy profiles. 
The present study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of 
ginsenoside Rf to human osteosarcoma cells and to explore 
the anticancer molecular mechanisms of ginsenoside Rf. Five 
human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63, OS732, U-2OS, HOS 
and SAOS-2) were employed to investigate the cytotoxicity 
of ginsenoside Rf by MTT and colony forming assays. After 
treatment with ginsenoside Rf, MG-63 cells which were the 
most sensitive to ginsenoside Rf, were subjected to flow cytom￾etry to detect cell cycle distribution and apoptosis, and nuclear 
morphological changes were visualized by Hoechst 33258 
staining. Caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities were also evaluated. 
The expression of cell cycle markers including cyclin B1 and 
Cdk1 was detected by RT-PCR and western blotting. The 
expression of apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bax and the release of 
cytochrome c were also examined by western blotting. Change 
in the mitochondrial membrane potential was observed by JC-1 
staining in situ. Our results demonstrated that the cytotoxicity 
of ginsenoside Rf to these human osteosarcoma cell lines was 
dose-dependent, and the MG-63 cells were the most sensitive 
to exposure to ginsenoside Rf. Additionally, ginsenoside Rf 
induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MG-63 
cells. Furthermore, we observed upregulation of Bax and 
downregulation of Bcl-2, Cdk1 and cyclin B1, the activation 
of caspase-3 and -9 and the release of cytochrome c in MG-63 
cells following treatment with ginsenoside Rf. Our findings 
demonstrated that ginsenoside Rf induces G2/M phase cell 
cycle arrest and apoptosis in human osteosarcoma MG-63 
cells through the mitochondrial pathway, suggesting that 
ginsenoside Rf, as an effective natural product, may have a 
therapeutic effect on human osteosarcoma.
Introduction
Panax ginseng was discovered over 5,000 years ago in China 
and has since been regarded as a highly venerated medicinal 
herb. In recent years, natural products from plants, including 
ginsenosides, have attracted increased attention due to their 
favorable safety and efficacy profiles, suggesting a potential 
therapeutic application in the treatment of cancers. Recently, it 
has been reported that ginsenosides exhibit cytotoxic activity 
in a variety of human tumor cell lines (1). Previous studies 
revealed that ginsenoside Rg3 contributes to a reduction 
in proliferation (2,3), metastasis (3,4) and induction of cell 
death (5) in several types of cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. But 
few studies have focused on its effects on human osteosarcoma 
cell lines. Moreover, ginsenoside Rh2 has been demonstrated 
to have anticancer effects (5,6) and to be capable of inhibiting 
cell growth and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in 
mammalian tumor cells (7). Based on these previous studies, 
ginseng compounds have been considered as potential agents 
for cancer chemotherapy.
Structurally, most of the ginsenosides belong to the 
protopanaxadiol (PPD), and protopanaxatriol (PPT) groups(8). 
Previous reports have identified that ginsenoside Rg1 and Rh1 
have the most potent effect on the inhibition of cell proliferation 
in cancer cells (9,10). In fact, steam treatment with increasing 
concentrations of ginsenoside Rg1 and Rh1 augments the anti￾proliferative activities of those ginsenosides. Ginsenoside Rf 
is a type of extract from the active constituents of ginseng, 
and has a structure characteristic of the presence of a hydroxyl 
group/sugar residue at C-6 in PPTs and is unique to Asian 
ginseng (1). It has been proposed that ginsenoside Rf may play 
an important role in regulating cancer cell proliferation since 
this molecule has a similar chemical structure with ginsen￾oside Rg1 and Rh1. However, the effect of ginsenoside Rf on 
cancer cells remains to be elucidated.
Osteosarcoma is the eighth most common form of child￾hood cancer, comprising 2.4% of all malignancies in pediatric

patients and ~20% of all primary bone cancers. The 5-year 
survival rate of osteosarcoma patients is only 50-70% due 
to the lack of effective treatment options (11). Concerning 
the clinical treatment of cancer, cell cycle control, a major 
regulatory mechanism of cell proliferation, is one of the most 
effective methods for cancer treatment through inhibition of 
cancer cell growth (12). Thus, there are many cytotoxic agents 
and/or DNA damaging agents that arrest the cell cycle at the 
G0/G1, S or G2/M phase consequently inducing apoptosis of 
cancer cells (13). The cyclin/Cdk families have been found 
to play an important role in G2 to M phase progression, 
particularly at the end of the G2 phase when a threshold level 
of the active cyclin B1/CDK1 complex, also known as matura￾tion promoting factor (MPF), has been reached, followed by 
induction of cell apoptosis (14). Apoptosis is the result of a 
highly complicated cascade of cellular events that result in 
cell rounding and shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA 
fragmentation, shedding of smaller fragments from cells, and 
detachment from the plate. In particular, the mitochondria play 
a central role in the occurrence of apoptosis resulting from 
many chemotherapeutic agents (15). It is also well known 
that caspases, such as caspase-3, -8 and -9, which are highly 
conserved cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases 
and the key components of the apoptotic machinery, play the 
central role in apoptotic progression (16).
The present study was designed to clarify the antitumor 
activity of ginsenoside Rf in a panel of established cancer 
cell lines by MTT and colony forming assays. Furthermore, 
we investigated cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial-associated 
apoptotic events in the osteosarcoma MG-63 cell line, which 
is the most sensitive to ginsenoside Rf, in order to elucidate 
the mechanism of ginsenoside Rf-induced apoptosis in human 
osteosarcoma.
Materials and methods
Drugs and materials. Ginsenoside Rf was purchased from 
the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) 
(CAS no. 111719) at a purity of 99.69%. Dulbecco's modified 
Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum (FCS), trypan blue, 
penicillin G and streptomycin were obtained from Gibco-BRL 
(Gaithersburg, MD, USA). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO), ribonuclease (RNase), propidium iodide (PI) and 
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium 
(BCIP/NBT) were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, 
MO, USA). The Apoptosis Detection Kit I was a product of BD 
Pharmingen. Hoechst 33258, JC-1 and caspase assay kits were 
purchased from Beyotime (Jiangsu, China). Human reactive 
monoclonal antibodies against cyclin B1, Cdk1, Bcl-2, Bax, 
cytochrome c and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Cell lines and cell culture. Human osteosarcoma cell lines, 
MG-63 (wild-type), OS732 (wild-type), U-2OS (wild-type), 
HOS (wild-type) and SAOS-2 (wild-type), were purchased 
from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, The 
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were 
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated 
FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. They 
were all placed in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% 
CO2 at 37˚C.
Analysis of cell proliferation. The cytotoxicity assay was 
analyzed with the MTT assay and the trypan blue dye assay. 
Briefly, MG-63, OS732, U-2OS, HOS and SAOS-2 cells were 
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1x104 cells/well with 
100 µl of the cell culture medium. After 12 h of incubation, 
the cells were treated with ginsenoside Rf from 0 to 30 µM 
in medium for 24 h. MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was then added 
to each well and incubated at 37˚C for 4 h. The supernatants 
were then removed and replaced by 100 µl DMSO. The optical 
density (OD) was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm with an 
enzyme immunoassay analyzer (Bio-Rad, USA). The cytotox￾icity of ginsenoside Rf was expressed as IC50 (concentration of 
50% cytotoxicity, which was extrapolated from linear regres￾sion analysis of the experimental data).
Colony forming assay. MG-63, OS732, U-2OS, HOS and 
SAOS-2 cells were seeded at 3x102
/well into 24-well culture 
plates, respectively, and incubated overnight prior to treatment. 
Culture medium containing increasing drug concentrations 
was added to the cells, and incubation was carried out for 
7 days in the presence of the drug. After the wells were washed 
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the colonies were fixed 
with methanol, stained with crystal violet and counted (>50 
cells). The antiproliferative activity was expressed as EC50
(50% inhibiting concentration).
Analysis of cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. Cells 
(2x105
) were seeded in a 6-well culture plate. After a 12-h 
incubation, cells were treated with 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM of 
ginsenoside Rf for 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h, respectively. Both 
floating and adherent cells were harvested, combined and 
processed. Cells were collected by centrifugation, fixed with 
ice-cold 70% ethanol, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 
0.5 ml of PBS containing PI (500 µg/ml) and RNase A (1 mg/
ml). After a final incubation at 37˚C for 30 min, cells were 
analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). 
The percentages of cells in G0/G1 phase, S phase, G2/M and 
sub-G1 phase were analyzed using standard ModiFit and 
CellQuest software programs.
Detection of apoptotic incidence by flow cytometry. Apoptotic 
incidence was measured with the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis 
Detection Kit I according to the manufacturer's instruc￾tions. Briefly, cells were treated with 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM 
of ginsenoside Rf for 24 h, respectively. The cells were then 
washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in 500 µl of 
binding buffer at a concentration of 1x106 cells/ml. Annexin 
V-FITC solution (5 µl) and 5 µl of PI (1 mg/ml) were added to 
the cells at 37˚C for 30 min. The cells were analyzed by flow 
cytometry within 1 h. Apoptotic cells were counted, and data 
are expressed as a percentage of the total cell count.
Assay of mitochondrial membrane potential changes in situ. 
JC-1 probe was employed to measure mitochondrial depolar￾ization in MG-63 cells. Following treatment with 0, 2.75, 5.5 
and 11 µM of ginsenoside Rf for 24 h, the MG-63 cells were 
incubated at 37˚C for 20 min with 5 mg/l JC-1, then washed 

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 31: 305-313, 2014 307
twice with PBS and placed in 2 ml culture medium. Green 
fluorescence (JC-1 as a monomer at low membrane poten￾tials) and red fluorescence (JC-1 as ̔J-aggregatesʼ at higher 
membrane potentials) were monitored under a fluorescence 
microscope. Mitochondrial depolarization was indicated by a 
decrease in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio.
Hoechst 33258 staining of MG-63 cells. Cells were incu￾bated with 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM of ginsenoside Rf for 24 h, 
harvested, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 25˚C, 
washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, and exposed to 10 mg/l 
Hoechst 33258 in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. 
Finally, the stained nuclei were observed under a fluorescence 
microscope (Olympus x50) with excitation at 350 nm and 
emission at 460 nm.
Assays of caspase activity. Caspase activity was determined 
using caspase assay kits. According to the manufacturer's 
protocol, cells were placed in 10-cm dishes at 1x106
/dish. After 
a 12-h incubation, cells were treated with 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM 
of ginsenoside Rf for 24 h. After the different treatments, both 
floating and adherent cells were collected and washed 3 times 
by PBS and were lysed with lysis buffer (100 µl/2x106 cells) for 
15 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 
10 min at 4˚C. Then, clear lysates containing 50 µg of protein 
were incubated with 100 µM of enzyme-specific colorigenic 
substrates at 37˚C for 1 h. The activities of caspase-3, -8 and 
-9 were described as the cleavage of the colorimetric substrate 
by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm with a microplate 
spectrophotometer (BioTek), respectively.
Western blotting. Cells were placed in 10-cm dishes at 
1x106
/dish. After a 12-h incubation, cells were treated with 
0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM of ginsenoside Rf for 24 h. Total 
protein was extracted using a Western & IP cell lysis kit 
after treatment, or cytoplasmic protein was extracted using a 
Mitochondrial Isolation kit (Applygen). For total cell protein 
extracts, the treated cells were washed in PBS, suspended in 
lysis buffer and placed in ice for 30 min. After centrifugation 
for 15 min at 4˚C, the supernatant was collected. Total proteins 
were prepared by standard procedures and quantified by the 
BCA method (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA).
The western blot assay was performed as described 
previously. Briefly, whole cell extracts were separated by 
8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electropho￾resis (SDS-PAGE) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene 
difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). 
After the PVDF membranes were incubated with 10 mM 
TBS with 1.0% Tween-20 and 10% dehydrated skim milk 
to block nonspecific protein binding, the membranes were 
incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies in blocking 
buffer overnight at 4˚C. The membranes were then washed 
with TBST and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-linked 
secondary antibodies (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.). After being 
washed with TBST, immunoreactive bands were visualized 
using NBT/BCIP as substrate. β-actin was used as a loading 
control.
RT-PCR analysis of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 mRNA. Total RNA 
of the ginsenoside Rf-treated cells extracted using 1 ml 
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) was dissolved 
in 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) water and quantified 
by spectrophotometry at 260 nm (absorbance). cDNA was 
synthesized from 1 µg total RNA through reverse transcrip￾tion using a Takara RNA PCR kit ver. 2.1 (Takara Bio, Inc.) 
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers were 
obtained from Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Co. Ltd. 
(Shanghai, China), and the sequences for the primers are 
as follows: 5'-CTTATACTAAGCACCAAATC-3' (sense) 
and 5'-CTTGGCTAAATCTTGAACT-3' (antisense) for 
cyclin B1; 5'-CTTATGCAGGATTCCAGGTT-3' (sense) 
and 5'-GGTGCCTATACTCCAAATGTC-3' (antisense) for 
Cdk1; and 5'-GGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTG-3' (sense) 
and 5'-ATGAGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCAT-3' (antisense) for 
GAPDH. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using 
1 µg of cDNA and SYBR-Green (Bio-Bad) in 36-well plates 
in a LightCycler Rapid Thermal Cycler system (Roche 
Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
PCR products were subjected to melting curve analysis, and 
the data were analyzed by the 2-ΔΔCt calculation method and 
standardized to GAPDH. PCR analysis was performed in 
triplicate for each sample.
Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as the mean ± stan￾dard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using 
the SPSS 17.0 statistical software program to evaluate the 
significance of differences between groups considered as 
p<0.05; p<0.01; p<0.001. All data points represent the mean 
of triplicate values.
Results
Effect of ginsenoside Rf on cell proliferation in human osteo￾sarcoma cell lines. To clearly identify the antiproliferative 
effect of ginsenoside Rf on human osteosarcoma cell lines, 
we initially treated 5 human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63, 
OS732, U-2OS, HOS and SAOS-2) with ginsenoside Rf at 
different concentrations for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h, respectively. 
Cell proliferation and cell viability were estimated by the 
MTT assay and trypan blue staining. As shown in Fig. 1, the 
cytotoxicity of ginsenoside Rf to the human osteosarcoma 
cell lines was dose-dependent, and each cell line exhibited a 
different sensitivity to ginsenoside Rf. Notably, the MG-63 
cells were the most sensitive to ginsenoside Rf. The IC50
values for the cytotoxic effect are showed in Table I. The IC50

value for the MG-63 cells treated with ginsenoside Rf was 
11 µM at 24 h. This dose- and time-point were referred to in 
the following experiments. Doses of 0, 2.75 and 5.5 µM were 
used in the following assays. Our findings demonstrated that 
ginsenoside Rf inhibited cellular proliferation in a time- and 
dose-dependent manner.
Effect of ginsenoside Rf on the colony forming ability of 
human osteosarcoma cell lines. The EC50 values for colony 
formation are showed in Table I. The therapeutic indices (the 
ratio of IC50 vs. EC50) for the 5 human osteosarcoma cell lines 
were in the following order: MG-63, OS732, U-2OS, HOS and 
SAOS-2 successively. This suggested that MG-63 cells, which 
were used in the following experiments, were most sensitive to 
ginsenoside Rf with a therapeutic index (IC50 vs. EC50) equal 
to 12.21.
Ginsenoside Rf induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis 
in MG-63 cells. To determine whether changes in cell cycle 
distribution were involved in the decrease in cell viability, we 
investigated the effect of ginsenoside Rf on cell cycle distribu￾tion by flow cytometric analysis. The exposure of cells to 0, 
2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM ginsenoside Rf for 24 h resulted in the 
accumulation of the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase from 
13.26±2.6% to 15.63±2.9, 19.22±4.2 and 49.55±4.7%, respec￾tively (Fig. 2A). Ginsenoside Rf resulted in a time-dependent 
G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and G2/M phase accumula￾tion peaked following treatment with 11 µM ginsenoside Rf 
at 24 h (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that ginsenoside Rf 
inhibits the cellular proliferation via G2/M phase cell cycle 
arrest in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
The rate of cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry 
by double labeling with Annexin V and PI. Representative 
graphs obtained by flow cytometric analysis of cells treated 
with ginsenoside Rf at different concentrations for 24 h after 
double staining with Annexin V-FITC and PI are shown 
in Fig. 2C. The apoptotic rate in the control cells was 2.1±0.7%. 
There was a dose-dependent increase in the apoptotic rate of 
MG-63 cells exposed to ginsenoside Rf. The apoptotic rates 
in the MG-63 cells were increased to 4.6±1.6, 14.9±2.9 and 
29.6±3.8% following treatment with ginsenoside Rf at 2.75, 5.5 
and 11 µM for 24 h, respectively (Fig. 1D). Using Hoechst 33258 
staining, we further confirmed that ginsenoside Rf induced 
MG-63 cell death through the apoptosis pathway (Fig. 2E). 
MG-63 cells treated with 11 µM ginsenoside Rf for 24 h 
exhibited an increase in chromatin condensation and nuclear 
fragmentation. The results indicate that cell death occurred 
through apoptosis.
Effect of ginsenoside Rf on mitochondrial membrane 
potential in MG-63 cells. In order to investigate whether the 
mitochondrial pathway is involved in the apoptosis induced 
by ginsenoside Rf, we analyzed MG-63 cells treated with 
ginsenoside Rf at different concentrations for 24 h using the 
membrane potential sensing dye JC-1. The control cells stained 
with JC-1 emitted mitochondrial red fluorescence with slight 
green fluorescence, indicative of a normal polarized state. The 
JC-1 aggregates were dispersed to the monomeric form (green 
fluorescence) in the cells exposed to 11 µM ginsenoside Rf for 
24 h (Fig. 3A). The results showed that ginsenoside Rf reduced 
the ratio of red (JC-1 aggregates) fluorescence to green (JC-1 
monomers) fluorescence, indicating that ginsenoside Rf caused 
the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3B).
Effect of ginsenoside Rf on Cdk1 and cyclin B1 expression. 
In an attempt to investigate the molecular events involved in 
the activity of ginsenoside Rf activity on the cell cycle, we 
assessed the effect of ginsenoside Rf on the expression of Cdk1 
and cyclin B1 in MG-63 cells. The protein levels of Cdk1 and 
cyclin B1 were detected by western blotting after MG-63 cells 
were treated with 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM ginsenoside Rf for 
24 h. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, the level of cyclin B1 protein 
in the cells treated with 11 µM ginsenoside Rf increased almost 
1/5-fold over the control group at 24 h. As expected, we also 
found that the expression of Cdk1 protein was attenuated in 
the cells treated with 11 µM ginsenoside Rf, which was only 
~1/4 times more than the NC group. The changes in Cdk1 
and cyclin B1 mRNA expression, as measured by real-time 
PCR, were almost parallel with that of the corresponding 
protein (Fig. 4C). Our results suggest that downregulation of

the expression of G2 phase-regulating proteins may contribute 
to the ginsenoside Rf-mediated cell cycle arrest in MG-63 cells.
Effects of ginsenoside Rf on caspase activation. The caspase 
cascade reaction is one of the most important events in the 
process of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. 
To determine whether release of caspase-3, -8 and -9 is 
involved in ginsenoside Rf-induced apoptosis, MG-63 cells 
were treated with 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM ginsenoside Rf, 
and caspase-8, -9 and caspase-3 activation was determined 
at 24 h (Fig. 5). We assessed the caspase-3 and -9 levels in 
cell lysates and found that caspase-3 and -9 levels increased 
significantly in the MG-63 cells in a dose-dependent manner, 
which indicated that mitochondrial pathways were involved in 
ginsenoside Rf-induced apoptosis. Simultaneously, we found 
that activity of caspase-8 was not changed in the cells treated 
with ginsenoside Rf.
Effect of ginsenoside Rf on the expression of apoptosis￾related proteins. The loss of mitochondrial transmembrane 
potential and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria 
to the cytosol are pivotal events in the mitochondrial apoptosis 
pathway, which is regulated by Bcl-2 family members (such 
as Bcl-2 and Bax) during this process (17,18). To explore the 
possible role of Bcl-2 family members and cytochrome c in 
ginsenoside Rf-induced apoptosis, we investigated the effect 
of ginsenoside Rf at 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM for 24 h on the 
expression of proteins including Bcl-2, Bax and the release of 
cytochrome c by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, treat￾ment of MG-63 cells with ginsenoside Rf caused a marked 
increase in Bax proteins and the release of cytochrome c, and 
a decrease in Bcl-2 protein, when compared to these levels in 
the control.
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to clarify whether ginsen￾oside Rf has a cytotoxic effect on human osteosarcoma cells 
and to explore the molecular mechanisms involved during this 
process. The main findings of our study are as follows. First, 
we demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of ginsenoside Rf to 
human osteosarcoma cell lines was dose-dependent and that 
the MG-63 cells were the most sensitive to ginsenoside Rf. 
Second, we showed that ginsenoside Rf induced G2/M phase

After treatment with 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM of ginsenoside Rf for 24 h, 
significant increases in caspase-3 and -9 activity were noted but not for cas￾pase-8. Significant differences from control cells are indicated by **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.

cell cycle arrest and cell death through the apoptosis pathway. 
Furthermore, we found that the mitochondrial pathway partici￾pated in the process of apoptosis induced by ginsenoside Rf.
Conventional chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells as 
well as normal cells, limiting their therapeutic use in the clinic. 
Previous studies have shown that natural bioactive reagents 
as an approach to effective cancer prevention can selectively 
kill cancer cells, based on their favorable safety and efficacy 
profiles (19). Ginseng, a widely used traditional Chinese 
medicine, has been reported to exhibit various biological 
effects including antitumor activity (1). The antitumor efficacy 
of ginseng is attributed mainly to the presence of saponins, 
known as ginsenosides. Previous studies have demonstrated 
that several ginsenosides such as the ginsenoside Rg3 and Rh2 
lead to the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase and cell 
apoptosis by DNA damaging agents (20,21). However, whether 
ginsenoside Rf, which is unique to Asian ginseng, influences 
human osteosarcoma cell viability and regulates cell apoptosis 
has not been reported. Here, we first investigated the cyto￾toxicity of ginsenoside Rf to MG-63, OS732, U-2OS, HOS 
and SAOS-2 cells. According to our results, ginsenoside Rf 
inhibited cell proliferation in the human osteosarcoma cell 
lines in a dose-dependent manner. MG-63 cells were the most 
sensitive to ginsenoside Rf. The value of IC50 in the MG-63 
cells following treatment with ginsenoside Rf was found to be 
11 µM at 24 h. Therefore, we chose this dose- and time-point 
as a reference for MG-63 cells in other experiments.
The cell cycle is mediated by the activation of a highly 
conserved protein kinase family, the cyclin-dependent 
kinases (Cdks) (22). Cyclins can activate Cdks by forming 
complexes with Cdks, and these cyclin/Cdk complexes are cell 
cycle regulators. Among them, the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex, 
in which B-type cyclins associate with Cdk1, is the primary 
regulator of transition from the G2 to M phase. This complex 
was originally discovered and defined as the maturation￾promoting factor or M phase-promoting factor (MPF). The 
cell cycle arrests at the G2 phase and mitosis cannot occur 
without activation of the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex. In the 
present study, flow cytometric analysis showed that ginsen￾oside Rf caused G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and G2/M phase 
accumulation peaked at 24 h of treatment. Subsequently, the 
apoptotic sub-G1 phase increased obviously after >24 h of 
treatment, suggesting the occurrence of sequential events of 
cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis; it is known that cell 
cycle dysregulation is a hallmark of tumor cells. Evidence 
indicates that G2/M phase arrest is mediated by a limited 
supply of Cdk1 and cyclin B1 for Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex 
formation, resulting in the shortage of the cyclin B1/Cdk1 
complex during cell cycle progression (23). In the present 
study, we found that ginsenoside Rf arrested MG-63 cells in 
the G2/M phase through a decrease in the cyclin B1/Cdk1 
complex resulting from inhibition of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 
expression in a dose-dependent manner at both the transcrip￾tional and protein levels. According to the results mentioned 
above, ginsenoside Rf induced G2/M phase arrest in MG-63 
cells by the downregulation of Cdk1 and cyclin B1.
Apoptosis, first recognized by Kerr et al (24), is originally 
described as a series of morphological events that give rise 
to controlled cell death and is executed by an active cellular 
process. This fundamental process is essential for both 
development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. There 
are two principal signaling transduction pathways involved in 
the process of apoptosis: one is the cell surface death receptor 
pathway, and the other is the mitochondrial pathway initiated 
by the upregulation of wild-type p53, followed by suppression 
of Bcl-2. Moreover, these two pathways can be connected 
via Bid, one of the Bcl-2 family members (25). In the present 
study, the inhibition of cell viability was observed in ginsen￾oside Rf‑treated MG-63 cells. After treatment, cells gradually 
exhibited cell rounding and shrinkage, vacuolization and even 
detachment from the bottom in a time-dependent manner, 
which are important characteristics of cell apoptosis. This 
was further supported by our findings of increased chromatin 
condensation and nuclear fragmentation over time as observed 
by Hoechst 33258 staining. Our findings demonstrated that 
ginsenoside Rf may serve as a protective agent in cancer 
treatment as we observed that the apoptosis ratio increased to 
29.6±3.8% in MG-63 cells following treatment with ginsen￾Figure 6. Activation of Bcl-2, Bax and accumulation of cytosolic cytochrome c during ginsenoside Rf-induced apoptosis. (A) Western blot analysis of protein 
extracts obtained from MG-63 cells treated with 0, 2.75, 5.5 and 11 µM ginsenoside Rf, respectively. Total protein extracts or cytosolic fraction of cells were 
prepared after treatment for 24 h, and analyzed with antibodies to Bcl-2, Bax and cytochrome c. β-actin was used as a loading control. (B) Quantitative analysis

oside Rf at 11 µM for 24 h when compared to control cells 
(2.1±0.7%), which is consistent with previous reports on other 
ginsenosides (such as ginsenosides Rg1) (26).
The Bcl-2/Bax ratio appears to be a critical determinant of 
a cell's threshold for undergoing apoptosis through the mito￾chondrial pathway (27). Our results showed that upregulation 
of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 occurred simultane￾ously in the human osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 following 
treatment with ginsenoside Rf, which triggered progression 
of apoptosis. Therefore, we inferred that the decrease in the 
Bcl-2/Bax ratio modulated by ginsenoside Rf induced apop￾tosis of MG-63 cells. This hypothesis was further supported by 
nuclear morphological changes using Hoechst 33258 staining. 
The mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway is triggered 
by various cellular stress stimuli and is dependent on mito￾chondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting in the 
loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the release 
of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol (18). 
Thus, cells use cytosolic cytochrome c as a cue to activate 
the apoptotic machinery (28). Our results demonstrate that 
MG-63 cells treated with ginsenoside Rf exhibited a reduction 
in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Using western blot 
analysis, a dose-dependent increase in cytochrome c accumula￾tion was found in the cytosol of ginsenoside Rf-treated MG-63 
cells. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rf stimulates the 
reduction in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the 
release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, finally activating the 
mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway.
In order to clarify the effect of caspases in the apoptotic 
process, we determined the activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. 
Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play essential roles 
in apoptosis, necrosis and inflammation. The activation of 
caspase-8, which in turn activates downstream caspases, leads 
to apoptosis through the death receptor pathway, whereas the 
activation of caspase-9, which forms the apoptosome with 
released cytochrome c and Apaf-1, activates the executioner 
caspase-3 and induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial 
pathway. In the present study, consistent with the study of 
Rannou et al (29), we also found that ginsenoside Rf had no 
effect on caspase-8 activity, suggesting that the death receptor￾mediated apoptotic pathway was not involved in the apoptosis 
induced by ginsenoside Rf in MG-63 cells. Notably, we found 
that ginsenoside Rf enhanced caspase-3 and -9 activities in 
a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the mitochondrial 
death pathway was involved in the process of apoptosis induced 
by ginsenoside Rf. These results are in concordance with those 
reported in another study, showing a linkage between activa￾tion of caspase-9 cleavage and activation of procaspase-3 
consequently leading to activation of the caspase cascade and 
apoptosis (30).
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ginsenoside Rf 
inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest at the 
G2/M phase and apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells in 
a dose- and time-dependent manner. The cell cycle arrest 
induced by ginsenoside Rf was associated with a reduction 
in the protein and mRNA levels of Cdk1 and cyclin B1. 
Furthermore, we found that ginsenoside Rf decreased the 
Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the mitochondrial transmembrane poten￾tial, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and activation of 
caspase-9 and -3, suggesting that the mitochondrial pathway 
may be involved in the process of apoptosis induced by ginsen￾oside Rf in MG-63 cells. In view of the above arguments and 
the new data presented herein, ginsenoside Rf can induce 
G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in human osteosarcoma 
MG-63 cells through the mitochondrial pathway. It may be 
a new effective and promising therapeutic agent for human 
osteosarcoma, although further research must be carried out 
to fully investigate these possibilities.
