ABSTRACT
Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive disorder, which leads 
to right heart failure and even death. Overactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system accounts for the development and 
progression of PAH. The role of renal denervation (RDN) in different periods of PAH 
has not been fully elucidated. A single intraperitoneal injection of monocrotaline (MCT, 
60 mg/kg) was used to induce pulmonary remodeling in male Sprague Dawley rats 
(n = 40). After 24-hour of MCT administration, a subset of rats underwent RDN 
(RDN24h, n = 10); after 2-week of MCT injection, another ten rats received RDN 
treatment (RDN2w, n = 10) and the left 20 rats were divided to MCT group with sham 
RDN operation (MCT, n = 20). Eight rats in Control group received intraperitoneal 
injection of normal saline (60 mg/kg) once and sham RDN surgery. After 35 days, 
tissue and blood samples were collected. Histological analysis demonstrated that the 
collagen volume fraction of right ventricle, lung tissue and pulmonary vessel reduced 
significantly in RDN24h group but not in the RDN2w group, compared with MCT group. 
Moreover, the earlier RDN treatment significantly decreased SNS activity and blunted 
RAAS activation. Importantly, RDN treatment significantly improved the survival rate. 
In summary, earlier RDN treatment could attenuate cardio-pulmonary fibrosis and 
therefore might be a promising approach to prevent the development of PAH.
INTRODUCTION
Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a 
complicated and fatal disease. Although progress achieved 
during last two decades with the introduction of oral 
medical therapies, the prognosis of PAH remains poor, 
especially in patients with advanced right heart failure [1]. 
It is imperative to seek potentially new therapies that 
prevent the development and progression of PAH. In 
the past few years, many experiments have indicated 
an important role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS), 
in particular aldosterone [2–7]. Recently, de Man F.S. et al.
found that the progression of PAH was accompanied by 
systemic RAAS overactivity [2].
We [8] and other investigators [9, 10] have reported 
that renal denervation (RDN) has the ability to reduce SNS 
activity and rebalance RAAS. It is reasonable to investigate 
the impact of RDN on PAH. And limited experiments have 
discussed the optimal time for RDN to treat PAH. Using 
a rat model of monocrotaline (MCT) induced pulmonary 
remodeling, we sought to study these isssues.
RESULTS
Right ventricular function
At day 35, echocardiography revealed significant 
increases in right ventricular anterior wall thickness (RVAW, 
1.56 ± 0.20 mm vs. 1.00 ± 0.25 mm, p < 0.05), Non-filling 
time of right ventricle (NFT; r, 133.33 ± 30.97 ms vs. 106.44 
± 18.23 ms, p < 0.05), and pulmonary ejection time (PET, 
88.89 ± 4.63 vs. 73.78 ± 5.59, p < 0.05) in MCT-induced PAH 
group compared with the RDN24h group. Compared with 
MCT group, RVAW in RDN2w group (1.03 ± 0.15 mm vs. 
1.56 ± 0.20 mm, p < 0.05) was significantly reduced (Table 1).

Body weight (BW), heart weight (HW) and the 
ratio of HW/BW
Compared with Control, MCT significantly 
decreased the body weight (BW) (287.33 ± 57.08 g vs. 
348.36 ± 46.25 g, p < 0.05) of the rats, while there was 
no significant differences between RDN (RDN24h and 
RDN2w) groups and Control group. But RDN therapy had 
no influence on the ratio of HW/BW (Table 2).
Fibrosis of lung tissue and pulmonary vessel
With regard to pulmonary fibrosis, collagen 
deposition was observed to be significantly higher in MCT 
challenged animals as measured by Masson’s trichrome 
staining. These changes were completely manifested 
35 days after MCT injection and without intervention 
with RDN procedure. Remarkably, RDN treatment after 
monocrotaline injection 24 hours reversed lung tissue 
fibrosis (5.64% ± 1.57% RDN24h vs. 10.18% ± 3.90% MCT, 
p < 0.05) and pulmonary vascular fibrosis (8.87% ± 5.22% 
RDN24h vs. 14.92% ± 5.52% MCT, p < 0.05). But, when we 
performed RDN procedure after monocrotaline injection for 
2 weeks, the improvements in lung tissue fibrosis (9.19% ± 
2.27% RDN2w vs. 10.18% ± 3.90% MCT, p = 0.375) and 
pulmonary vascular fibrosis (12.05% ± 5.40% RDN2w vs. 
14.92% ± 5.52% MCT, p = 0.303) effects of RDN were 
blunted (Figures 1 and 2).
Fibrosis of right ventricle and cross-sectional 
area of heart
RDN surgery performed in the earlier stage of 
PAH resulted in significantly reduced RVAW thickness 
(1.00 ± 0.25 mm vs. 1.56 ± 0.20 mm, p < 0.05) compared 
with MCT group (Figure 3). Monocrotaline injection 
results in pulmonary arterial hypertension and right heart 
failure, which were accompanied by myocardial and 
pulmonary fibrosis. The cross-sectional area of myocardial 
interstitial fibrosis was inhibited by earlier RDN therapy 
(11.39% ± 5.00% MCT vs. 6.96% ± 4.09% RDN24h, 
p < 0.05) which was increased by monocrotaline injection. 
However, there are no significant differences between 
RDN2w group and MCT group (Figure 4).
RDN reduces RAAS and SNS activity
Ang II, which regulates fibroblast proliferation, 
differentiation and extracellular matrix deposition, is 
an important pro-fibrosis factor. Compared with MCT 
group, RDN24h group significantly decreased plasma 
Ang II concentration (277.94 ± 110.00 pg/ml vs. 
154.96 ± 55.98 pg/ml, p < 0.05), while only decreasing 
tendency of plasma Ang II concentration was observed 
in RDN2w group. ALD, a member of RAAS, was also 
significantly reduced in RDN24h (26.97 ± 6.53 pg/ml vs. 
14.64 ± 3.70 pg/ml, p < 0.05) and RDN2w (26.97 ± 6.53 pg/
ml vs. 16.87 ± 8.44 pg/ml, p < 0.05) group. To response 
to overactive SNS, postganglionic neurons release high 
concentration NE, RDN blunted this increase. Compared 
with MCT, NE concentration significantly decreased in 
RDN24h (84.98 ± 15.06 pg/ml vs. 56.90 ± 25.39 pg/ml, 
p < 0.05) and RDN2w (84.98 ± 15.06 pg/ml vs. 57.16 ± 
30.00 pg/ml, p < 0.05) group (Figure 5).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
During the follow-up in the current experiment, 4 
of 10 rats died both in the RDN24h and RDN2w group, and 
13 of 20 animals died in the MCT group. None rats in the 
Control group died. On Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, 
after 35 days of follow-up, the rats treated with RDN 
(RDN24h and RDN2w) had higher survival rate (60% vs. 
35%) than MCT group (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
The present study mainly demonstrated that: 1) MCT 
induces remarkable fibrosis in lung tissue, pulmonary 
vascular and right ventricular; 2) RDN decreases the 
activity of RAAS and SNS; 3) RDN prevents lung 
tissue, pulmonary vascular and right ventricular fibrosis 
and results in a time-dependent improvement in cardio￾pulmonary remodeling.
MCT-induced pulmonary remodeling is a process 
from lung tissue and pulmonary vascular fibrosis to 
pulmonary hypertension, and then causes right ventricular 
remodeling and failure [11, 12]. In this process, 
neurohormonal systems such as the RAAS and SNS are 
up-regulated [2]. At 35 days, echocardiography revealed 
significant increases in right ventricular anterior wall 
thickness (RVAW) in MCT-induced pulmonary remodeling 
group compared with control. Compared with Control,

MCT significantly increased the the Ratio of HW/BW of 
the rats. We observed high concentration plasma NE, out￾of-balanced RAAS axis, and excessive collagen deposition 
of cardio-pulmonary. While RDN surgery performed 
in the earlier stage resulted in significant attenuation of 
MCT-induced disease progression.
Pulmonary remodeling is a transitional phase to 
pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Thus, 
it is of great importance to find a way to slow or even 
reverse the progression of pulmonary remodeling. Velez￾Roa S et al. have reported that the activity of SNS was 
increased in patients with pulmonary hypertension, and 
sympathetic activation participated in pulmonary arteriolar 
remodeling [7]. Previous data revealed that β-blockers 
could delay the progression toward right heart failure, and 
partially preserves right ventricular function in pulmonary 
hypertension [13, 14]. Linz D et al. had reported that 
RDN reduced tyrosine hydroxylase-positive sympathetic 
nerve staining and resulted in lower norepinephrine levels 
[15]. In recent studies, they had reported that pulmonary 
artery denervation induces permanent sympathetic nerve 
injury and subsequent improvements in hemodynamics 
and pulmonary remodeling in humans and animals with 
pulmonary hypertension [11, 16, 17]. In our prior study, 
we also found that RDN could regulate the expression 
of β1,2-receptors, which contribute to inhibit cardiac 
remodeling [8]. In accordance with these studies, we 
concluded that RDN significantly reduced NE level. The 
involvement of the RAAS in myocardial fibrosis is evident 
in several pathological conditions such as hypertensive 
heart disease [18], congestive heart failure [19] and 
myocardial infarction [20]. There is experimental and 
clinical evidence indicating that activated RAAS is 
involved in the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension 
[2, 21–23]. Ang II, the major effector peptide of the RAAS, 
promotes vasoconstriction, inflammation, proliferation and 
fibrosis within the lung [24, 25]. And plasma aldosterone 
levels were elevated in experimental models of pulmonary 
hypertension and humans with the disease [26, 27]. The 
persistently elevated level of aldosterone initiates signaling 
pathways that promote vascular remodeling, impair 
vascular reactivity, and contributes to right ventricular 
dysfunction [28]. We [8] and others [9, 10] had reported 
that RDN could reduce SNS activity and rebalance RAAS.

In this regard, RDN has been of extreme significance when 
evaluating the effects of direct reducing SNS and RAAS 
activity. In our current study, we found a prominently 
beneficial effect of RDN in the earlier phase of disease 
process. What of particular interest was that RDN inhibited 
cardiopulmonary fibrosis and slowed down the progression 
of right heart failure. But treatment with RDN in the later 
period of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension had no 
significant influence on pulmonary hemodynamics and 
remodeling of cardiopulmonary.
The prominent reversal of cardiopulmonary fibrosis 
is a remarkable and noteworthy effect of RDN treatment. 
Fibrosis is a common pathway to organ injury and failure 
[29]. We observed a 44.6% reduction of lung fibrosis, 
40.5% reduction in pulmonary vascular fibrosis and 38.9% 
reduction in right ventricular fibrosis following RDN at the 
35-day time point. As deposition of fibrous tissue in heart 
or lung is associated with the increasing risk of adverse 
cardiovascular events [30], the ability of RDN preventing 
fibrosis might contribute to a better prognosis of PAH.
Pulmonary hypertension is commonly associated with 
increased afterload, which causes maladaptive remodeling 
of the right ventricle, characterized by hypertrophy and 
fibrosis [31]. In addition, persistent pressure overload 
induces cardiomyocyte death and contractile dysfunction, 
which eventually leads to end-organ failure. The beneficial 
outcomes of RDN treatment were associated with decreased 
right ventricular remodeling and improved right heart 
function. But these beneficial effects were blunted when 
RDN performed in the later period.
Earlier RDN treatment in the process of PAH 
disease could improve right ventricular function and 
reduce cardio-pulmonary fibrosis, and it also improved 
survival rate in MCT-induced PAH. These experimental 
findings suggest that RDN should be further investigated 
as a potential approach for treating earlier stage of PAH.
Study limitation
We should acknowledge the limitations in our study. 
Firstly, we failed to measure mean pulmonary arterial pressure 
at the end of this study. At day 35, we tried to test RV pressure 
and pulmonary artery pressure using right heart catheterization, 
but many rats in MCT group died when we opened their chests, 
and the collected data were too few to be analyzed. However, 
MCT-induced PAH is a well-established model, and both the 
mortality and echocardiographic data indicated that MCT had 
worked. Meanwhile, pulmonary remodeling was substantiated 
by histological analysis. Secondly, whether RDN is superior to 
oral drugs needs future investigation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and experimental design
All procedures in this study were performed 
in accordance with the Guide for The Care and Use 
of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health 
publication 8th edition, 2011) and were approved by the 
Nanjing Medical University Experimental Animal Care 
and Use Committee. The experiment was performed in 
male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 ± 20 g (Nanjing 
Medical University Laboratory Animal Center), caged 
individually at controlled temperature and humidity with a 
12-hour light/dark cycle. Echocardiography was performed 
at baseline and week 5. MCT injection was performed after 
echocardiography at baseline. Forty-eight male Sprague 
Dawley rats were randomized into 4 groups. Group 1 
consisted of 8 rats that received normal saline and sham 
RDN procedure (Control). Group 2 comprised 10 rats that 
received MCT and RDN after 24 hour of intraperitoneally 
injected with 60 mg/kg MCT (MCT+RDN24h). Group 
3 comprised 10 rats that received MCT and renal 
denervation after 2 weeks of intraperitoneally injected 
with 60 mg/kg MCT (MCT+RDN2w). Group 4 comprised 
20 rats that received MCT and sham renal denervation 
procedure (MCT). At the end of the study, after the second 
echocardiography work-up and blood collection, all 
animals were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital 
sodium (200 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.
MCT-Induced PAH
Forty-eight male Sprague Dawley rats were 
randomly assigned to four groups: Control group (n = 8), 
MCT+RDN24h group (n = 10), MCT+RDN2w group 
(n = 10) and MCT group (n = 20). MCT-induced PAH 
rats were intraperitoneally injected with 60 mg/kg 
monocrotaline [32–34] (Sigma, Switzerland), which was 
dissolved in 1 mol/L HCL, the PH was adjusted to 7.4 and 
diluted with PBS.
Renal denervation
With pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal 
injection) anesthesia, bilateral renal denervation was 
performed in RDN24h and RDN2w group, whereas sham 
RDN procedure was performed in MCT and Control 
group. RDN was implemented as described previously 
[8]. Visible nerves along the renal arteries and veins were 
stripped and picked with 10× magnification. Chemical 
denervation was conducted by daubing the bilateral renal 
artery with 20% phenol solution in absolute alcohol. Then 
the arteries and veins were washed with isotonic saline. 
For sham RDN procedure, the operation was the same, 
but the renal arteries and veins were not isolated and the 
nerves were left intact.
Echocardiography
Cardiac structure and function were evaluated 
by echocardiography with Vevo2100-a high resolution 
imaging system (VisualSonics, Canada) with a MS-250, 
16.0–21.0 MHZ imaging transducer at baseline and week 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 46853 Oncotarget
5. All of the rats were anesthetized by aether during the 
process of echocardiography work-up.
Histopathology
After perfusion with ice-cold PBS, the heart and 
lung were cut and fixed in 4% phosphate buffered formalin 
for 48–72 h at 4°C, then tissues were dehydrated and 
embedded in paraffin. The heart and lung tissues were 
fast frozen by liquid nitrogen, then moved to –80°C. 
Masson’s trichrome staining was performed to detect right 
ventricular and lung fibrosis. Five fields of each sample 
were randomly selected and collagen volume fraction 
(CVF) was assessed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0.
ELISA
Blood samples were obtained by EDTA-tubes, and 
then centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes to 
separate the plasma which stored at –80°C for later use. 
Plasma norepinephrine (NE), aldosterone (ALD) and 
angiotensin II (Ang II) levels at day 35 were measured 
using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Uscn Life 
Science Inc, Wuhan, China).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
Survival over the 35-day experiment was analyzed 
according to the daily recording of deaths by the standard 
Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log rank test.
Statistics
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM and analyzed 
by SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). For two￾group comparison, data were analyzed with two-tailed 
unpaired t tests. For multiple-groups comparisons, data 
were performed using one-way ANOVA with LSD test. 
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusions, RDN significantly prevents the 
overactivity of RAAS and SNS, and attenuates lung tissue, 
pulmonary vascular and right ventricular fibrosis in the 
earlier stage of pulmonary hypertension. Simultaneously, 
RDN improves the survival rate of PAH.
