Abstract
Background: Multimorbidity and the associated use of multiple medicines (polypharmacy), is common in the older
population. Despite this, there is no consensus definition for polypharmacy. A systematic review was conducted to
identify and summarise polypharmacy definitions in existing literature.
Methods: The reporting of this systematic review conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE and Cochrane were systematically searched, as well
as grey literature, to identify articles which defined the term polypharmacy (without any limits on the types of
definitions) and were in English, published between 1st January 2000 and 30th May 2016. Definitions were
categorised as i. numerical only (using the number of medications to define polypharmacy), ii. numerical with an
associated duration of therapy or healthcare setting (such as during hospital stay) or iii. Descriptive (using a brief
description to define polypharmacy).
Results: A total of 1156 articles were identified and 110 articles met the inclusion criteria. Articles not only defined
polypharmacy but associated terms such as minor and major polypharmacy. As a result, a total of 138 definitions of
polypharmacy and associated terms were obtained. There were 111 numerical only definitions (80.4% of all
definitions), 15 numerical definitions which incorporated a duration of therapy or healthcare setting (10.9%) and 12
descriptive definitions (8.7%). The most commonly reported definition of polypharmacy was the numerical
definition of five or more medications daily (n = 51, 46.4% of articles), with definitions ranging from two or more to
11 or more medicines. Only 6.4% of articles classified the distinction between appropriate and inappropriate
polypharmacy, using descriptive definitions to make this distinction.
Conclusions: Polypharmacy definitions were variable. Numerical definitions of polypharmacy did not account for specific
comorbidities present and make it difficult to assess safety and appropriateness of therapy in the clinical setting.
Keywords: Polypharmacy, Multimorbidity, Comorbidity, Inappropriate prescribing, Aged, Systematic review
Background
Multimorbidity, commonly defined as the co-existence
of two or more chronic health conditions, is common in
the older population [1]. The presence of multiple
chronic conditions increases the complexity of thera￾peutic management for both health professionals and
patients, and impacts negatively on health outcomes.
Multimorbidity is associated with decreased quality of
life, self-rated health, mobility and functional ability as
well as increases in hospitalisations, physiological dis￾tress, use of health care resources, mortality and costs
[2–4]. Globally, the health burden of multimorbidity is
expected to rise significantly as a result of the growing
number of older people and increasing numbers of
people living with multimorbidity [5].
The use of multiple medicines, commonly referred to
as polypharmacy is common in the older population
with multimorbidity, as one or more medicines may be
used to treat each condition. Polypharmacy is associated
with adverse outcomes including mortality, falls, adverse
drug reactions, increased length of stay in hospital and
readmission to hospital soon after discharge [6–8]. The

risk of adverse effects and harm increases with increas￾ing numbers of medications [9]. Harm can result due to
a multitude of factors including drug-drug interactions
and drug-disease interactions. Older patients are at even
greater risk of adverse effects due to decreased renal and
hepatic function, lower lean body mass, reduced hearing,
vision, cognition and mobility [10].
While in many instances the use of multiple medi￾cines or polypharmacy may be clinically appropriate, it
is important to identify patients with inappropriate
polypharmacy that may place patients at increased risk
of adverse events and poor health outcomes. Studies
have suggested a shift towards adopting the term
‘appropriate polypharmacy’ in order to differentiate
between the prescribing of ‘many’ and ‘too many’ drugs
instead of a simple numerical count of medications,
which is of limited value in practice [11, 12]. In order
to make this distinction between appropriate and
inappropriate polypharmacy, the term polypharmacy
needs to be clearly defined. We therefore conducted a
systematic review to explore the definitions of poly￾pharmacy in existing literature. We additionally aimed
to explore whether articles differentiated between
appropriate and inappropriate polypharmacy and how
this distinction was made.
Methods
Data sources and search strategy
The reporting of this systematic review conforms to the
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist.
MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE and Cochrane data￾bases were searched between 1st January 2000 and
30th May 2016.
The following search terms (Medical Subject Headings
or MESH and keywords) were used in EMBASE and
MEDLINE (Ovid):
polypharmacy/ (MESH) OR multiple medication*
OR multiple medicine* OR multiple drug* (key
words) OR many medication* OR many medicine*
OR many drug* (key words) (for all articles referring
to polypharmacy) AND.
defin* (key word) or explan* (keyword) (for all articles
defining or explaining polypharmacy).
For the review of the Cochrane database, the term
“polypharmacy” was searched.
The search was limited to primary research articles
which defined the term polypharmacy in any shape
or form, conducted in humans and published in
English between the years 2000 and 2016. Articles
were considered if the abstracts were available in
English and were published or in press. Reference
lists of relevant articles and grey literature were
screened to identify other relevant articles. The
search strategy was developed in consultation with a
librarian specialising in health databases, with a pre￾determined protocol developed collaboratively with
the authors for methods to search and select rele￾vant articles.
Study selection and data extraction
Articles that met the inclusion criteria and provided a
definition of polypharmacy were included. One author
(NM) conducted the initial database search and primary
screening of article titles and abstracts and articles were
categorised as: relevant, irrelevant or unsure. Three re￾viewers (NM, SS, GC) discussed the appropriateness of
inclusion of each article classed as relevant or unsure.
Once all relevant articles were identified, one author
(NM) reviewed full texts of all identified articles and ex￾tracted the data. A pre-defined data extraction template
was developed by all authors and then applied to ensure
consistent data extraction from each of the identified
studies. Data items extracted included the definitions of
polypharmacy and associated terms such as minor,
moderate and excessive polypharmacy and whether
studies distinguished between appropriate and inappro￾priate polypharmacy and if so, how this distinction was
made or defined. The definitions of polypharmacy and
associated terms were categorised as: i. numerical only
(using the number of medications to define polyphar￾macy), ii. numerical for a given duration of therapy or
healthcare setting for e.g. during hospital stay or iii.
Descriptive (using a brief description to define polyphar￾macy). Once the primary data extraction was complete
all authors reviewed the content analysis for each of the
extracted studies, with data further categorised and
summarised in tables.
Results
A total of 1156 articles were identified and 110 articles
met the full inclusion criteria for this systematic review
[10–119]. Fig. 1 shows a flowchart of study selection ac￾cording to the PRISMA checklist.
Studies not only defined polypharmacy but also used
associated terms to define the level of polypharmacy;
including minor (8 studies, 7.3%), moderate (1 study,
0.9%), major (12 studies, 10.9%), hyper (2 studies, 1.8%),
excessive (10 studies, 9.1%), severe (1 study, 0.9%),
appropriate (1 study, 0.9%), rational polypharmacy and
indiscriminate prescribing (1 study, 0.9%), persistent (1
study, 0.9%), chronic (1 study, 0.9%), and pseudopoly￾pharmacy (1 study, 0.9%). As a result, a total of 138 defi￾nitions of polypharmacy and associated terms were
obtained. There were 111 numerical only definitions
(80.4% of all definitions), 15 numerical definitions which
Masnoon et al. BMC Geriatrics (2017) 17:230 Page 2 of 10

incorporated a duration of therapy or healthcare setting
(10.9%) and 12 descriptive definitions (8.7%). Table 1
presents a breakdown of the number of definitions for
each term.
Out of the 110 identified articles, 81 (73.6%) included
only a numerical definition of polypharmacy (i.e. did not
specify duration of therapy or healthcare setting). Nine
articles (8.2%) included numerical definitions of poly￾pharmacy for a given duration of time or healthcare set￾ting and nine articles (8.2%) included descriptive
definitions of polypharmacy. Four articles included two
categories of polypharmacy definitions: two articles
(1.8%) included both numerical only definitions and nu￾merical definitions of polypharmacy for a duration of
time or healthcare setting and two articles (1.8%) in￾cluded both numerical only and descriptive definitions
of polypharmacy.
Numerical only definitions of polypharmacy in existing
literature
Table 2 shows the various numerical only categorisations
of polypharmacy and associated terms and the number
of studies using these definitions.
There was a wide range of variability in the definitions
of polypharmacy as well as associated terms such as
minor, moderate and major polypharmacy. The most
commonly used term was polypharmacy, but there was
variation with regard to the actual definition of poly￾pharmacy, which ranged from two or more medications
to 11 or more medications [13, 90]. The most commonly
used definition for polypharmacy was five or more medi￾cations daily, with 46.4% (n = 51) of studies using this
definition [11, 24–73]. The second most common defin￾ition for polypharmacy was six or more medications,
with ten studies using this definition [10, 74–82]. Only

one study defined polypharmacy as the number of drug
classes used by a patient [91].
Numerical definitions of polypharmacy incorporating a
duration of therapy or healthcare setting
Eleven studies (10.0% of all studies) used numerical defini￾tions of polypharmacy which incorporated a duration of
therapy in the definition and four studies (3.6%) used
definitions of polypharmacy which incorporated a health￾care setting (Table 3). The definitions of polypharmacy in￾volving a duration of therapy, ranged from use of two or
more medications for more than 240 days (‘long term
use’) to five to nine medications used for 90 days or more
[101, 108]. Polypharmacy definitions incorporating a
healthcare setting included the use of five or more medi￾cations at hospital discharge, and the use of 10 or more
medications during hospital stay [106, 110].
Descriptive definitions of polypharmacy
Twelve studies used descriptive definitions of polyphar￾macy (Table 4). Some studies used different wording but
conveyed the same definition of polypharmacy. For ex￾ample, the definitions “Co-prescribing multiple medica￾tions” [113] and “Simultaneous and long term use of
different drugs by the same individual” [77] describe
polypharmacy as the use of multiple medications con￾currently. Other studies alluded to a different issue of
medications being appropriate or inappropriate for a
given patient [10, 79, 114–118].
Appropriate and inappropriate polypharmacy
Only seven studies (6.4% of all studies) defined appropri￾ate or rational polypharmacy, or recognised the distinc￾tion between appropriate and inappropriate medications
[10, 79, 114–118]. These studies either defined polyphar￾macy using a brief description only (n = 3) [79, 115, 117]
or used a brief description and polypharmacy tools such
as the Beers criteria and the Medication Appropriateness
Index (MAI) (n = 4 studies) [10, 114, 116, 118]. An
example of a polypharmacy definition which recognised
the use of appropriate and inappropriate medications is
“polypharmacy ranges from the use of a large number of
medications, to the use of potentially inappropriate
medications, medication underuse and duplication” and
“potentially inappropriate medications” [114]. Out of the
two studies defining polypharmacy as “potentially

“potentially inappropriate medications” without further
explanation [79] and the other study included examples
of potentially inappropriate medications from existing
literature such as duplication of medications, drug-drug
interactions, medications used to treat side effects of
other medications and medications which are
unnecessary for a specific patient [10]. Only one study
explicitly defined appropriate polypharmacy, which was
defined as “the optimisation of medications for patients
with complex and/or multiple conditions where
medicine usage agrees with best evidence” [117].
Four studies (3.6%) used polypharmacy tools or
criteria to identify potentially inappropriate medica￾tions [10, 114, 116, 118]. The Beers criteria as an
indicator of potentially inappropriate medications
were used in all four (three studies used Beers criteria
2003 and one used Beers criteria 1997) [10, 114, 116, 118].

Information Set (HEDIS) [114]. None of the studies
explicitly identified the need to distinguish between
appropriate and inappropriate polypharmacy based on
the pharmacology of medications involved, how they
interact with each other and comorbidities for a
specific patient.
Of the 110 studies included in the review, only one
highlighted the inconsistencies in the definitions of
polypharmacy in the literature. The authors of this
study suggested that polypharmacy be defined as
patients visiting multiple pharmacies which may be
associated with safety concerns relating to potential
outcomes such as medication duplication, drug-drug
interactions and adverse effects [112].
Discussion
The results of this systematic review show that there is
large heterogeneity in the definition of polypharmacy;
ranging from numerical counts only, numerical counts
for a given duration of therapy or setting or descriptive,
which included terms such as minor, moderate, major
and excessive polypharmacy. The lack of a clear and uni￾versal definition of polypharmacy as well as terms such
as minor, moderate major polypharmacy makes it chal￾lenging for healthcare professionals to assess and con￾sider efficacy and safety issues within the clinical setting.
The most commonly reported category of definitions
for polypharmacy and associated terms was numerical
only. The most commonly used term was polypharmacy
which was defined as five or more medications by 46.4%
of studies (51 articles). There was a wide range of nu￾merical only definitions of polypharmacy, ranging from
two or more medications to 11 or more medications.
However, the clinical basis for using a numerical count
such as five or more medications to define polyphar￾macy and the potential of this to rationalise medication
use and optimise health outcomes is not elucidated in
most studies. It has been postulated that while the term
polypharmacy has evolved over time, the basis for the
definition is simply more drugs being prescribed or
taken than are clinically appropriate in the context of a
patient’s comorbidities [12]. It is commonly reported
that as the number of prescribed drugs increases, so do
the chances of adverse drug events and likelihood of
harm [120]. However, the specific number of drugs taken
is not itself indicative of appropriateness of therapy as all
of the drugs may be clinically necessary and appropriate
for the patient. Despite this, only one study argued that
instead of using numerical counts of medications, clini￾cians should identify appropriateness of therapy, where
potential benefits outweigh the potential harms [121].
There is a clear need towards adopting the term ‘appro￾priate polypharmacy’ in order to differentiate between
the prescribing of ‘many’ and ‘too many’ drugs instead
of a simple numerical count of medications, which is of
limited value in practice [11, 12, 120–122].
Whilst the addition of duration of therapy or health￾care setting to a count of medicines in the definition of
polypharmacy provided more specific definitions, it did
not provide any further clarity or consistency. Five or
more medications were again used in the definitions but
with a period of time attached such as 90 days or more
[104]. The use of duration in the definitions appeared to
be included to identify those patients with longer term
or chronic use of medications, potentially identifying
those patients who might be at greatest risk of
medication-related problems. Definitions incorporating a
healthcare setting commonly used five or more medica￾tions as the count, but using a setting such as at the
time of hospital discharge [106].These definitions were
largely based on the dispensing data available to assess
prevalence and incidence of polypharmacy, rather than
an evidence based approach of determining appropriate￾ness of therapy; the setting provided little addition to
existing definitions of polypharmacy in a clinical sense
of medication rationalisation and minimisation of harm.
A recent commentary on polypharmacy stated that
while a large body of literature confirms the fact that
patients are increasingly taking large numbers of
medications, numerical definitions of polypharmacy
do not ascertain the clinical appropriateness of ther￾apy and the process of rationalising those medications
[123]. The author argued that when each of the medi￾cations can be linked to practice guidelines for
chronic conditions for a given patient, using a numer￾ical cut-off to define polypharmacy becomes irrele￾vant. While the number of medications can be a
starting point, medications should be assessed in
terms of their indication, efficacy and potential for
harm with each other (not in isolation) given pharma￾cokinetic and pharmacodynamics interactions, in
order to facilitate deprescribing of inappropriate med￾ications [123, 124]. Medications should be assessed
for risks and benefits and the final combination of
medications should be based on benefits outweighing
the risks [124, 125]. Current literature is alluding to
looking beyond single disease management guidelines
and considering the patient’s complete scenario by
considering all comorbidities and medications being
prescribed for a given patient to consider the patient
as a whole and focusing on improving the overall
health [11, 12, 117, 120–122, 125].
While the use of multiple medicines may be clinically
appropriate for some patients, it is important to identify
those patients who may be at risk of adverse health out￾comes as a result of inappropriate polypharmacy. Only
seven studies recognised the distinction between appro￾priate and inappropriate polypharmacy. This is crucial to
Masnoon et al. BMC Geriatrics (2017) 17:230 Page 6 of 10

facilitate the deprescribing of inappropriate medications
and optimal use of appropriate medications. Consider￾ation of comorbid conditions and other medications is
required to make definitions clinically relevant, to facili￾tate medication assessment and rationalisation in every
day practice. While a small number of studies (3.6%)
used polypharmacy tools or criteria including the Beers
criteria, MAI and HEDIS to identify potentially inappro￾priate medications to detect potentially inappropriate
medications, the limitations of the tools and criteria in
the everyday clinical setting were recognised [10, 114,
116, 118].The Beers criteria which was used in all four
studies identified, is a commonly used prescribing as￾sessment tool based on a list of potentially inappropriate
medications to be avoided in the older population [126,
127]. However, it has recognised limitations such as re￾quiring regular updates to ensure clinical relevance and
including a list of outdated medications which may not
be used in practice at that time.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this systematic review include the novelty
of summarising the range of polypharmacy definitions
available in literature. A comprehensive search strategy
of three large and reliable databases (MEDLINE,
EMBASE and Cochrane) was used, meaning that it is
likely that all relevant articles were identified.
A limitation of this review is the inclusion of studies in
English only which can cause information bias. While
EMABSE, MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane databases
were searched, the absence of other databases such as
Scopus could have introduced selection bias. Addition￾ally articles from the year 2000 until present have been
included. There may be clinically relevant definitions for
polypharmacy which were added to literature prior to
2000 which have not been included in this review. While
authors discussed the inclusion criteria and data being
extracted, there is still the potential for confusion bias.
Conclusions
While the most commonly used definition of polyphar￾macy is being on five or more medicines, definitions are
variable, which can cause confusion for researchers as
well as clinicians in practice. Numerical definitions of
polypharmacy do not account for specific comorbidities
present and make it difficult to assess safety and appro￾priateness of therapy in the clinical setting. There is a
need for an internationally agreed definition of polyphar￾macy. The results indicate the need for a shift towards
the term ‘appropriate polypharmacy’ using a holistic ap￾proach of assessing medication use in context of comor￾bidities present, according to best available evidence in
order to optimise health outcomes.

Authors’ contributions
NM conducted the primary screening of article titles and abstracts and
categorisation of articles as: relevant, irrelevant or unsure. Articles which were
categorised as ‘unsure’ were discussed with SS and GC. The final list of
relevant articles was formed by consensus amongst all authors. Once all
relevant articles were identified, NM reviewed full texts of all identified
articles and categorised the different polypharmacy definitions. NM, SS, LK
and GC made substantive intellectual contributions to the conception and
design of the study as well as interpretation of data. NM drafted the initial
manuscript and all authors were involved in critically reviewing and revising
the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript and
