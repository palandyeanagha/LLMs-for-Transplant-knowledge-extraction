Research Article
Surgical experience in the management of spontaneous pneumothorax,
1972-82.
1. D Weeden,
2. G H Smith
Abstract
In the past 11 years 233 patients have undergone 241 parietal
pleurectomies for either recurrence of their spontaneous
pneumothorax or failure to respond adequately to management by
tube drainage. Major complications occurred in 3.7% of cases, with
transaxillary apical pleurectomy engendering significantly fewer
complications than full pleurectomy through a posterolateral
thoracotomy. The significantly larger number of minor


complications, however, in patients undergoing full pleurectomy
was largely due to the larger number of patients with chronic
obstructive lung disease in this group. On the basis of our
experience we advocate the use of transaxillary apical pleurectomy
for the younger age group with recurrent pneumothoraces and a full
pleurectomy in the older age group, who frequently present because
of failure to respond satisfactorily to tube drainage during their
initial pneumothorax and often have lung disease secondary to
chronic obstructive lung disease which is not confined to the apex
of the upper lobe.
