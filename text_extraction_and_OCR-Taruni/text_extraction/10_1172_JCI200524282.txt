Liver fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins including collagen 
that occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases. Advanced liver fibrosis results in cirrhosis, 
liver failure, and portal hypertension and often requires liver transplantation. Our knowledge of 
the cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver fibrosis has greatly advanced. Activated hepatic 
stellate cells, portal fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts of bone marrow origin have been identi￾fied as major collagen-producing cells in the injured liver. These cells are activated by fibrogenic 
cytokines such as TGF-β1, angiotensin II, and leptin. Reversibility of advanced liver fibrosis in 
patients has been recently documented, which has stimulated researchers to develop antifibrotic drugs. Emerging 
antifibrotic therapies are aimed at inhibiting the accumulation of fibrogenic cells and/or preventing the deposi￾tion of extracellular matrix proteins. Although many therapeutic interventions are effective in experimental mod￾els of liver fibrosis, their efficacy and safety in humans is unknown. This review summarizes recent progress in the 
study of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of liver fibrosis and discusses current antifibrotic strategies.
Historical perspective
Liver fibrosis results from chronic damage to the liver in conjunc￾tion with the accumulation of ECM proteins, which is a charac￾teristic of most types of chronic liver diseases (1). The main causes 
of liver fibrosis in industrialized countries include chronic HCV 
infection, alcohol abuse, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). 
The accumulation of ECM proteins distorts the hepatic architec￾ture by forming a fibrous scar, and the subsequent development 
of nodules of regenerating hepatocytes defines cirrhosis. Cirrhosis 
produces hepatocellular dysfunction and increased intrahepatic 
resistance to blood flow, which result in hepatic insufficiency and 
portal hypertension, respectively (2).
Hepatic fibrosis was historically thought to be a passive and 
irreversible process due to the collapse of the hepatic parenchyma 
and its substitution with a collagen-rich tissue (3, 4). Currently, it 
is considered a model of the wound-healing response to chronic 
liver injury (5). Early clinical reports in the 1970s suggested that 
advanced liver fibrosis is potentially reversible (6). However, liver 
fibrosis received little attention until the 1980s, when hepatic stel￾late cells (HSCs), formerly known as lipocytes, Ito cells, or perisinu￾soidal cells, were identified as the main collagen-producing cells in 
the liver (7). This cell type, first described by von Kupffer in 1876, 
undergoes a dramatic phenotypic activation in chronic liver diseases 
with the acquisition of fibrogenic properties (8). Methods to obtain 
HSCs from both rodent and human livers were rapidly standardized 
in the 1980s (9, 10), and prolonged culture of HSCs on plastic was 
widely accepted as a model for the study of activated HSCs (11). Key 
signals that modulate HSCs’ fibrogenic actions were delineated (12). 
Experimental models for studying liver fibrogenesis in rats and in 
transgenic mice were developed, which corroborated the cell culture 
studies and led to the identification of key fibrogenic mediators (13). 
Besides HSCs, portal myofibroblasts and cells of bone marrow ori￾gin have been recently shown to exhibit fibrogenic potential (14, 15). 
At the clinical level, the natural history of liver fibrosis, from early 
changes to liver cirrhosis, was delineated in patients with chronic 
HCV infection (16, 17). Rapid and slower fibrosers were identified, 
and genetic and environmental factors influencing fibrosis progres￾sion were partially uncovered (18). Since the demonstration, in the 
1990s, that even advanced liver fibrosis is reversible, researchers have 
been stimulated to identify antifibrotic therapies (19). Biotechnol￾ogy and pharmaceutical companies are increasingly interested in 
developing antifibrotic programs, and clinical trials are currently 
underway. However, the most effective therapy for treating hepatic 
fibrosis to date is still to remove the causative agent (20). A number 
of drugs are able to reduce the accumulation of scar tissue in experi￾mental models of chronic liver injury. Renin-angiotensin system 
blockers and antioxidants are the most promising drugs, although 
their efficacy has not been tested in humans. Lack of clinical trials is 
due to the requirement of long follow-up studies and to the fact that 
liver biopsy, an invasive procedure, is still the gold-standard method 
for detecting changes in liver fibrosis. The current effort to develop 
noninvasive markers to assess liver fibrosis is expected to facilitate 
the design of clinical trials.
Recently, NASH has been recognized as a major cause of liver 
fibrosis (21). First described by Ludwig et al., it is considered 
part of the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (22). 
These range from steatosis to cirrhosis and can eventually lead to 
hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is a component of the metabolic 
syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, type 2 diabetes mel￾litus, and dyslipidemia, with insulin resistance as a common fea￾ture. As the prevalence of obesity is rapidly increasing, a rise in the 
prevalence of NASH is anticipated.
This review outlines recent progress in the pathogenesis, diagno￾sis, and treatment of liver fibrosis, summarizes recent data on the 
mechanisms leading to fibrosis resolution, and discusses future 
prospects aimed at developing effective antifibrotic therapies.
Natural history and diagnosis
The onset of liver fibrosis is usually insidious, and most of the 
related morbidity and mortality occur after the development of 
cirrhosis (16). In the majority of patients, progression to cirrhosis

occurs after an interval of 15–20 years. Major clinical complica￾tions of cirrhosis include ascites, renal failure, hepatic encephalop￾athy, and variceal bleeding. Patients with cirrhosis can remain free 
of major complications for several years (compensated cirrhosis). 
Decompensated cirrhosis is associated with short survival, and 
liver transplantation is often indicated as the only effective therapy 
(23). Cirrhosis is also a risk factor for developing hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Liver fibrosis progresses rapidly to cirrhosis in several 
clinical settings, including repeated episodes of severe acute alco￾holic hepatitis, subfulminant hepatitis, and fibrosing cholestasis 
in patients with HCV reinfection after liver transplantation (24). 
The natural history of liver fibrosis is influenced by both genetic 
and environmental factors (Table 1). Epidemiological studies have 
identified polymorphisms in a number of candidate genes that 
may influence the progression of liver fibrosis in humans (18). 
These genetic factors may explain the broad spectrum of responses 
to the same etiological agent found in patients with chronic liver 
diseases. However, some studies have yielded contradictory results 
due to poor study design, and further research is required to clarify 
the actual role of genetic variants in liver fibrosis.
Liver biopsy is considered the gold-standard method for the 
assessment of liver fibrosis (25). Histologic examination is useful 
in identifying the underlying cause of liver disease and assessing 
the necroinflammatory grade and the stage of fibrosis. Fibrosis 
stage is assessed by using scales such as Metavir (stages I–IV) and 
Ishak score (stages I–V). Specific staining of ECM proteins (e.g., 
with Sirius red) can be used to quantify the degree of fibrosis, 
using computer-guided morphometric analysis. Liver biopsy is 
an invasive procedure, with pain and major complications occur￾ring in 40% and 0.5% of patients, respectively (26). Sampling error 
can occur, especially when small biopsies are analyzed. Histologic 
examination is prone to intra- and interobserver variation and 
does not predict disease progression (27). Therefore, there is a 
need for reliable, simple, and noninvasive methods for assessing 
liver fibrosis. Scores that include routine laboratory tests, such 
as platelet count, aminotransferase serum levels, prothrombin 
time, and serum levels of acute phase proteins have been proposed 
(28, 29). Serum levels of proteins directly related to the hepatic 
fibrogenic process are also used as surrogate markers of liver 
fibrosis (30), including N-terminal propeptide of type III colla￾gen, hyaluronic acid, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 1 
(TIMP-1), and YKL-40. Although these scores are useful in detect￾ing advanced fibrosis (cirrhosis) in patients, as well as minimal or 
no fibrosis, they are not effective for differentiating intermedi￾ate grades of fibrosis. Also, fibrosis-specific markers may reflect 
fibrogenesis in other organs (i.e., pancreatic fibrosis in alcoholic 
patients). Finally, hepatic fibrosis can be estimated by imaging 
techniques. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and MRI 
can detect changes in the hepatic parenchyma due to moderate 
to severe fibrosis (31). Due to its low cost, ultrasonography is 
an appealing technique. It is able to detect liver cirrhosis based 
on changes in liver echogenicity and nodularity as well as signs 
of portal hypertension. However, ultrasound is highly operator￾dependent, and the presence of increased liver echogenicity does 
not reliably differentiate hepatic steatosis from fibrosis. Nonin￾vasive methods currently in development include blood protein

technology, which is based on DNA sequencer/fragment analyz￾ers able to generate profiles of serum protein N-glycans (32). As 
the technology becomes validated, the noninvasive diagnosis of 
liver disease may become routine clinical practice.
Pathogenesis of liver fibrosis
Hepatic fibrosis is the result of the wound-healing response of the 
liver to repeated injury (1) (Figure 1). After an acute liver injury 
(e.g., viral hepatitis), parenchymal cells regenerate and replace 
the necrotic or apoptotic cells. This process is associated with 
an inflammatory response and a limited deposition of ECM. If 
the hepatic injury persists, then eventually the liver regeneration 
fails, and hepatocytes are substituted with abundant ECM, includ￾ing fibrillar collagen. The distribution of this fibrous material 
depends on the origin of the liver injury. In chronic viral hepati￾tis and chronic cholestatic disorders, the fibrotic tissue is initially 
located around portal tracts, while in alcohol-induced liver disease, 
it locates in pericentral and perisinusoidal areas (33). As fibrotic 
liver diseases advance, disease progression from collagen bands to 
bridging fibrosis to frank cirrhosis occurs.
Liver fibrosis is associated with major alterations in both the 
quantity and composition of ECM (34). In advanced stages, the 
liver contains approximately 6 times more ECM than normal, 
including collagens (I, III, and IV), fibronectin, undulin, elastin, 
laminin, hyaluronan, and proteoglycans. Accumulation of ECM 
results from both increased synthesis and decreased degradation 
(35). Decreased activity of ECM-removing MMPs is mainly due to 
an overexpression of their specific inhibitors (TIMPs).
HSCs are the main ECM-producing cells in the injured liver 
(36). In the normal liver, HSCs reside in the space of Disse and 
are the major storage sites of vitamin A. Following chronic inju￾ry, HSCs activate or transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like 
cells, acquiring contractile, proinflammatory, and fibrogenic 
properties (37, 38) (Figure 2A). Activated HSCs migrate and 
accumulate at the sites of tissue repair, secreting large amounts 
of ECM and regulating ECM degradation. PDGF, mainly pro￾duced by Kupffer cells, is the predominant mitogen for activated 
HSCs. Collagen synthesis in HSCs is regulated at the transcrip￾tional and posttranscriptional levels (39). Increased collagen 
mRNA stability mediates the increased collagen synthesis in 
activated HSCs. In these cells, posttranscriptional regulation 
of collagen is governed by sequences in the 3′ untranslated 
region via the RNA-binding protein αCP2 as well as a stem-loop 
structure in the 5′ end of collagen mRNA (40). Interestingly, 
HSCs express a number of neuroendocrine markers (e.g., reelin, 
nestin, neurotrophins, synaptophysin, and glial-fibrillary acidic 
protein) and bear receptors for neurotransmitters (8, 41, 42).

Quiescent HSCs express markers that are characteristic of 
adipocytes (PPARγ, SREBP-1c, and leptin), while activated HSCs 
express myogenic markers (α smooth muscle actin, c-myb, and 
myocyte enhancer factor–2).
Hepatic cell types other than HSCs may also have fibrogenic 
potential. Myofibroblasts derived from small portal vessels pro￾liferate around biliary tracts in cholestasis-induced liver fibro￾sis to initiate collagen deposition (43, 44) (Figure 2B). HSCs 
and portal myofibroblasts differ in specific cell markers and 
response to apoptotic stimuli (45). Culture of CD34+CD38–
hematopoietic stem cells with various growth factors has been 
shown to generate HSCs and myofibroblasts of bone marrow 
origin that infiltrate human livers undergoing tissue remodeling 
(15, 46). These data suggest that cells originating in bone mar￾row can be a source of fibrogenic cells in the injured liver. Other 
potential sources of fibrogenic cells (i.e., epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition and circulating fibrocytes) have not been demonstrat￾ed in the liver (47, 48). The relative importance of each cell type 
in liver fibrogenesis may depend on the origin of the liver inju￾ry. While HSCs are the main fibrogenic cell type in pericentral 
areas, portal myofibroblasts may predominate when liver injury 
occurs around portal tracts.
A complex interplay among different hepatic cell types takes 
place during hepatic fibrogenesis (Figure 3) (49). Hepatocytes are 
targets for most hepatotoxic agents, including hepatitis viruses, 
alcohol metabolites, and bile acids (50). Damaged hepatocytes 
release ROS and fibrogenic mediators and induce the recruit￾ment of white blood cells by inflammatory cells. Apoptosis of 
damaged hepatocytes stimulates the fibrogenic actions of liver 
myofibroblasts (51). Inflammatory cells, either lymphocytes or 
polymorphonuclear cells, activate HSCs to secrete collagen (52). 
Activated HSCs secrete inflammatory chemokines, express cell 
adhesion molecules, and modulate the activation of lymphocytes 
(53). Therefore, a vicious circle in which inflammatory and fibro￾genic cells stimulate each other is likely to occur (54). Fibrosis is 
influenced by different T helper subsets, the Th2 response being 
associated with more active fibrogenesis (55). Kupffer cells are 
resident macrophages that play a major role in liver inflammation 
by releasing ROS and cytokines (56, 57). In chronic cholestatic 
disorders (i.e., primary biliary cirrhosis [PBC] and primary sclero￾sis cholangitis), epithelial cells stimulate the accumulated portal 
myofibroblasts to initiate collagen deposition around damaged 
bile ducts (43). Finally, changes in the composition of the ECM can 
directly stimulate fibrogenesis. Type IV collagen, fibrinogen, and 
urokinase type plasminogen activator stimulate resident HSCs by 
activating latent cytokines such as TGF-β1 (58). Fibrillar collagens 
can bind and stimulate HSCs via discoidin domain receptor DDR2 
and integrins. Moreover, the altered ECM can serve as a reservoir 
for growth factors and MMPs (59).
Genetic studies in rodents and humans
Extensive studies using models of hepatic fibrosis in transgenic 
mice have revealed key genes mediating liver fibrogenesis (1, 18). 
Genes regulating hepatocellular apoptosis and/or necrosis (e.g., 
Bcl-xL, Fas) influence the extent of hepatic damage and the subse￾quent fibrogenic response (60, 61). Genes regulating the inflam￾matory response to injury (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13, IFN-γ, 
SOCS-1, and osteopontin) determine the fibrogenic response to 
injury (55, 62–65). Genes mediating ROS generation (e.g., NADPH 
oxidase) regulate both inflammation and ECM deposition (66). 
Fibrogenic growth factors (e.g., TGF-β1, FGF), vasoactive sub￾stances (angiotensin II, norepinephrine), and adipokines (leptin 
and adiponectin) are each required for the development of fibrosis 
(67–70). Finally, removal of excess collagen after cessation of liver 
injury is regulated by TIMP-1 and TGF-β1 (71, 72).
Association genetic studies have investigated the role of gene 
polymorphisms in the progression of liver fibrosis in patients 
with chronic liver diseases (18). In alcoholic liver disease, candidate 
genes include genes encoding for alcohol-metabolizing enzymes 
and proteins involved in liver toxicity (73). Polymorphisms in 
genes encoding alcohol-dehydrogenase, aldehyde-dehydrogenase, 
and cytochrome P450 are involved in individual susceptibility 
to alcoholism, yet their role in the progression of liver disease 
remains controversial. Variations in genes encoding inflamma￾tory mediators (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, Il-10, and cytotoxic T lympho￾cyte antigen–4 [CTLA-4]), the lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14, 
and antioxidants (e.g., superoxide dismutase) may influence the 
Figure 3
Cellular mechanisms of liver fibrosis. Different types of hepatotoxic agents produce mediators that induce inflammatory actions in hepatic cell 
types. Damaged hepatocytes and biliary cells release inflammatory cytokines and soluble factors that activate Kupffer cells and stimulate the 
recruitment of activated T cells. This inflammatory milieu stimulates the activation of resident HSCs into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. Activated 
HSCs also secrete cytokines that perpetuate their activated state. If the liver injury persists, accumulation of activated HSCs and portal myofibro￾blasts occurs, synthesizing large amounts of ECM proteins and leading to tissue fibrosis. ECM degradation is inhibited by the actions of cytokines 
such as TIMPs. Apoptosis of damaged hepatocytes stimulates the fibrogenic actions of HSCs. If the cause of the liver injury is removed, fibrosis 
is resolved. This phase includes apoptosis of activated HSCs and regeneration of hepatocytes. Collagen is degraded by increased activity of

progression of alcohol-induced liver disease (74, 75). In chronic 
cholestatic disorders such as PBC, polymorphisms in IL-1β, IL-1 
receptor antagonists, and TNF-α genes are associated with faster 
disease progression (76). Some alleles of the apolipoprotein E gene 
influence the response to therapy of PBC with ursodeoxycholic 
acid, which suggests that genetic polymorphisms may predict 
therapeutic response (77). In HCV liver disease, genetic varia￾tions are involved in susceptibility to persistent HCV infection, 
response to antiviral therapy, and progression of liver disease (78). 
Polymorphisms in genes involved in the immune response to HCV 
infection (e.g., transporter associated with antigen processing 2, 
mannose-binding lectin, and specific HLA-II alleles) and fibro￾genic agonists (angiotensinogen and TGF-β1) influence fibrosis 
progression (79–81). The fibrogenic effect of heterozygosity in 
the C282Y mutation of the hemochromatosis gene in patients 
with chronic hepatitis C is controversial (82, 83). Finally, little is 
known about genetic factors and NASH (84), and polymorphisms 
in fibrogenic mediators such as angiotensinogen and TGF-β1 may 
be associated with more severe liver disease.
Key cytokines involved in liver fibrosis
Cytokines regulating the inflammatory response to injury mod￾ulate hepatic fibrogenesis in vivo and in vitro (85). Monocyte 
chemotactic protein type 1 and RANTES stimulate fibrogenesis 
while IL-10 and IFN-γ exert the opposite effect (55, 86). Among 
growth factors, TGF-β1 appears to be a key mediator in human 
fibrogenesis (58). In HSCs, TGF-β favors the transition to myofi￾broblast-like cells, stimulates the synthesis of ECM proteins, and 
inhibits their degradation. Strategies aimed at disrupting TGF-β1 
synthesis and/or signaling pathways markedly decreased fibrosis 
in experimental models (87). PDGF is the most potent mitogen 
for HSCs and is upregulated in the fibrotic liver (12); its inhibition 
attenuates experimental liver fibrogenesis (88).
Cytokines with vasoactive properties also regulate liver fibro￾genesis. Vasodilator substances (e.g., nitric oxide, relaxin) exert 
antifibrotic effects while vasoconstrictors (e.g., norepinephrine, 
angiotensin II) have opposite effects (67, 89). Endothelin-1, a pow￾erful vasoconstrictor, stimulates fibrogenesis through its type A 
receptor (90). Among vasoactive cytokines, angiotensin II seems to 
play a major role in liver fibrogenesis. Angiotensin II is the effector 
peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major regulator 
of arterial pressure homeostasis in humans. Key components of this 
system are locally expressed in chronically injured livers, and acti￾vated HSCs de novo generate angiotensin II (91, 92). Importantly, 
pharmacological and/or genetic ablation of the renin-angiotensin 
system markedly attenuates experimental liver fibrosis (70, 93–98). 
Angiotensin II induces hepatic inflammation and stimulates an 
array of fibrogenic actions in activated HSCs, including cell prolif￾eration, cell migration, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and 
collagen synthesis (66, 99, 100). These actions are largely mediated 
by ROS generated by a nonphagocytic form of NADPH oxidase. 
Unlike the phagocytic type, NADPH oxidases present in fibrogenic 
cell types are constitutively active, producing relatively low levels of 
ROS under basal conditions and generating higher levels of oxidants 
in response to cytokines, stimulating redox-sensitive intracellular 
pathways. NADPH oxidase also plays a key role in the inflamma￾tory actions of Kupffer cells (101). Disruption of an active NADPH 
oxidase protects mice from developing severe liver injury following 
prolonged alcohol intake and/or bile duct ligation (66, 102).
Adipokines, which are cytokines mainly derived from the adipose 
tissue, regulate liver fibrogenesis. Leptin is required for HSC activa￾tion and fibrosis development (103, 104). In contrast, adiponectin 
markedly inhibits liver fibrogenesis in vitro and in vivo (69). The 
actions of these cytokines may explain why obesity influences fibro￾sis development in patients with chronic hepatitis C (105).
Intracellular signaling pathways 
mediating liver fibrogenesis
Data on intracellular pathways regulating liver fibrogenesis are 
mainly derived from studies using cultured HSCs, while under￾standing of their role in vivo is progressing through experimental 
fibrogenesis studies using knockout mice (106). Several mitogen￾Table 2

activated protein kinases modulate major fibrogenic actions of 
HSCs. Extracellular-regulated kinase, which is stimulated in exper￾imentally induced liver injury, mediates proliferation and migra￾tion of HSCs (107). In contrast, c-Jun N-terminal kinase regulates 
apoptosis of hepatocytes as well as the secretion of inflammatory 
cytokines by cultured HSCs (66, 108, 109). The focal adhesion 
kinase PI3K-Akt–signaling pathway mediates agonist-induced 
fibrogenic actions in HSCs (107). The TGF-β1–activated Smad￾signaling pathway stimulates experimental hepatic fibrosis and 
is a potential target for therapy (110, 111). The PPAR pathway 
regulates HSC activation and experimental liver fibrosis. PPAR-γ
ligands inhibit the fibrogenic actions in HSCs and attenuate liver 
fibrosis in vivo (112, 113). NF-κB may have an inhibitory action on 
liver fibrosis (114, 115). Other transcription factors are involved 
in HSC activation and may participate in liver fibrogenesis (116). 
Recent studies suggest a role for intracellular pathways signaled by 
Toll-like receptors and β-cathepsin (117, 118).
Pathogenesis of fibrosis in different liver diseases
The pathogenesis of liver fibrosis depends on the underlying eti￾ology. In alcohol-induced liver disease, alcohol alters the popu￾lation of gut bacteria and inhibits intestinal motility, resulting 
in an overgrowth of Gram-negative flora. Lipopolysaccharide is 
elevated in portal blood and activates Kupffer cells through the 
CD14/Toll-like receptor–4 complex to produce ROS via NADPH 
oxidase (101). Oxidants activate Kupffer cell NF-κB, causing an 
increase in TNF-α production. TNF-α induces neutrophil infil￾tration and stimulates mitochondrial oxidant production in 
hepatocytes, which are sensitized to undergo apoptosis. Acetal￾dehyde, the major alcohol metabolism product, and ROS acti￾vate HSCs and stimulate inflammatory and fibrogenic signals 
(119). The pathogenesis of HCV-induced liver fibrosis is poorly 
understood due to the lack of a rodent model of persistent HCV 
infection (78). HCV escapes surveillance of the HLA-II–directed 
immune response and infects hepatocytes, causing oxidative 
stress and inducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Both 
factors lead to HSC activation and collagen deposition. Moreover, 
several HCV proteins directly stimulate the inflammatory and 
fibrogenic actions of HSCs (120). In chronic cholestatic disorders 
such as PBC, T lymphocytes and cytokines mediate persistent bile 
duct damage (14). Biliary cells secrete fibrogenic mediators acti￾vating neighboring portal myofibroblasts to secrete ECM. Even￾tually, perisinusoidal HSCs become activated, and fibrotic bands 
develop. The pathogenesis of liver fibrosis due to NASH is poorly 
understood. Obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia 
are the most common associated conditions (121). A 2-hit model 
has been proposed: hyperglycemia and insulin resistance lead 
to elevated serum levels of free fatty acids, resulting in hepatic 
steatosis. In the second hit, oxidative stress and proinflammatory 
cytokines promote hepatocyte apoptosis and the recruitment of 
inflammatory cells, leading to progressive fibrosis.
Is liver fibrosis reversible?
In contrast with the traditional view that cirrhosis is an irrevers￾ible disease, recent evidence indicates that even advanced fibrosis 
is reversible (122). In experimentally induced fibrosis, cessation 
of liver injury results in fibrosis regression (123). In humans, 
spontaneous resolution of liver fibrosis can occur after suc￾cessful treatment of the underlying disease. This observation 
has been described in patients with iron and copper overload, 
alcohol-induced liver injury, chronic hepatitis C, B, and D, hemo￾chromatosis, secondary biliary cirrhosis, NASH, and autoimmune 
hepatitis (19, 122, 124, 125, S1, S2) (Figure 4). It may take years for 
significant regression to be achieved; the time varies depending on 
the underlying cause of the liver disease and its severity. Chronic 
HCV infection is the most extensively studied condition, and ther￾apy (IFN-α plus ribavirin) with viral clearance results in fibrosis 
improvement. Importantly, nearly half of patients with cirrhosis 
exhibit reversal to a significant degree (90). Whether this beneficial 
effect is associated with improvements in long-term clinical out￾come, including decreased portal hypertension, is unknown.
Increased collagenolytic activity is a major mechanism of fibro￾sis resolution (122). Fibrillar collagens (I and III) are degraded by 
interstitial MMPs (MMP-1, -8, and -13 in humans and MMP-13 in 
rodents). During fibrosis resolution, MMP activity increases due to 
a rapid decrease in the expression of TIMP-1. Partial degradation 
of fibrillar collagen occurs, and the altered interaction between 
activated HSCs and ECM favors apoptosis (123). Removal of acti￾vated HSCs by apoptosis precedes fibrosis resolution. Stimulation 
of death receptors in activated HSCs and a decrease in survival fac￾tors, including TIMP-1, can precipitate HSC apoptosis (S3).
Several questions remain unanswered: Can we pharmacologi￾cally accelerate fibrosis resolution in humans? Can a fibrotic 
liver completely regress to a normal liver? Does fibrosis reverse 
similarly in all types of liver diseases? Although isolated cases of 
complete fibrosis resolution have been reported, it is conceivable 
that some degree of fibrosis cannot be removed (S4). Resolution 
may be limited by ECM cross-linking and a failure of activated 
HSCs to undergo apoptosis.
Therapeutic approaches to the treatment of liver fibrosis
There is no standard treatment for liver fibrosis. Although experi￾mental studies have revealed targets to prevent fibrosis progres￾sion in rodents (20) (Table 2), the efficacy of most treatments has 
not been proven in humans. This is due to the need to perform 
serial liver biopsies to accurately assess changes in liver fibrosis, the 
necessity of long-term follow-up studies, and the fact that humans 
are probably less sensitive to hepatic antifibrotic therapies than 
rodents. The development of reliable noninvasive markers of liver 
fibrosis should have a positive impact on the design of clinical tri￾als. The ideal antifibrotic therapy would be one that is liver-specific, 
well tolerated when administered for prolonged periods of time, 
and effective in attenuating excessive collagen deposition without 
affecting normal ECM synthesis.
The removal of the causative agent is the most effective interven￾tion in the treatment of liver fibrosis. This strategy has been shown 
effective in most etiologies of chronic liver diseases (19, 122, 124, 
125, S1, S2). For patients with cirrhosis and clinical complications, 
liver transplantation is currently the only curative approach (S5). 
Transplantation improves both survival and quality of life. How￾ever, in patients with HCV-induced cirrhosis, viral infection recurs 
after transplantation (S6), aggressive chronic hepatitis develops, 
and progression to cirrhosis is common.
Because inflammation precedes and promotes the progression 
of liver fibrosis, the use of antiinflammatory drugs has been 
proposed. Corticosteroids are only indicated for the treatment 
of hepatic fibrosis in patients with autoimmune hepatitis and 
acute alcoholic hepatitis (S1). Inhibition of the accumulation 
of activated HSCs by modulating either their activation and/or 
proliferation or promoting their apoptosis is another strategy.

Antioxidants such as vitamin E, silymarin, phosphatidylcholine, 
and S-adenosyl-L-methionine inhibit HSC activation, protect 
hepatocytes from undergoing apoptosis, and attenuate experi￾mental liver fibrosis (S7). Antioxidants exert beneficial effects in 
patients with alcohol-induced liver disease and NASH (S8, S9). 
Disrupting TGF-β synthesis and/or signaling pathways pre￾vents scar formation in experimental liver fibrosis (58). More￾over, administration of growth factors (e.g., IGF, hepatocyte 
growth factor, and cardiotrophin) or their delivery by gene ther￾apy attenuates experimental liver fibrosis (S10, S11). However, 
these latter approaches have not been tested in humans and may 
favor cancer development. Substances that inhibit key signal 
transduction pathways involved in liver fibrogenesis also have the 
potential to treat liver fibrosis (20). They include pentoxifylline 
(phosphodiesterase inhibitor), amiloride (Na+/H+ pump inhibi￾tor), and S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (Ras antagonist). Ligands 
of PPARα and/or PPARγ such as thiazolindiones exert benefi￾cial effects in experimental liver fibrosis and in patients with 
NASH (S12, S13). The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin sys￾tem is probably the most promising strategy in treating liver 
fibrosis. Renin-angiotensin inhibitors are widely used as antifi￾brotic agents in patients with chronic renal and cardiac diseases 
and appear to be safe when administered for prolonged periods 
of time (S14). Little information is available on the use of this 
approach in patients with chronic liver diseases. Preliminary 
pilot studies in patients with chronic hepatitis C and NASH 
suggest that renin-angiotensin blocking agents may have benefi￾cial effects on fibrosis progression (S15). Transplanted patients 
receiving renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as antihyperten￾sive therapy show less fibrosis progression than patients receiv￾ing other types of drugs (S16). However, this approach cannot 
be recommended in clinical practice until the results of ongoing 
clinical trials become available. The blockade of endothelin-1 
type A receptors and the administration of vasodilators (prosta￾glandin E2 and nitric oxide donors) exert antifibrotic activity 
in rodents, yet the effects in humans are unknown (90). Dif￾ferent herbal compounds, many of them traditionally used in 
Asian countries to treat liver diseases, have been demonstrat￾ed to have antifibrotic effects (S17). They include Sho-saiko-to, 
glycyrrhizin, and savia miltiorhiza. An alternative approach is 
the inhibition of collagen production and/or the promotion 
of its degradation (20). Inhibitors of prolyl-4 hydroxylase and 
halofuginone prevent the development of experimental liver cir￾rhosis by inhibiting collagen synthesis. MMP-8 and urokinase￾type plasminogen activator stimulate collagen degradation in 
vivo. The efficacy of these drugs in humans is unknown, and 
they may result in undesirable side effects. Finally, infusion of 
mesenchymal stem cells ameliorates experimentally induced 
fibrosis, which suggests a potential for this approach in the 
treatment of chronic liver diseases (S18, S19).
A limitation of the current antifibrotic approaches is that anti￾fibrotic drugs are not efficiently taken up by activated HSCs and 
may produce unwanted side effects. Cell-specific delivery to HSCs 
could provide a solution to these problems. Promising prelimi￾nary results have been recently obtained using different carriers 
(e.g., cyclic peptides coupled to albumin recognizing collagen 
type VI receptor and/or PDGFR) (S20). Antifibrotic therapy may 
differ depending on the type of liver disease. In patients with 
chronic HCV infection, current antiviral treatments (pegylated 
IFN plus ribavirin) clear viral infection in more than half of the 
patients (S21). Sustained virological response is associated with 
an improvement in liver fibrosis (122). Patients with no sus￾tained response may also experience improvement of liver fibro￾sis, which suggests that IFN-α has an intrinsic antifibrotic effect 
(S22). For nonresponder patients, the use of renin-angiotensin 
system inhibitors is a promising approach. Treatment of the 
metabolic syndrome in patients with chronic hepatitis C may 
also decrease fibrosis progression (S23). In patients with alco￾hol-induced liver disease, the most effective approach is alcohol 
abstinence (124). Antioxidants (e.g., S-adenosyl-L-methionine and 
phosphatidylcholine) and hepatocyte protectors (e.g., silymarin) 
slow down the progression of liver fibrosis and can improve sur￾vival (S24). For patients with autoimmune hepatitis, immuno￾suppressant therapy not only decreases inflammation but also 
exerts antifibrotic effects (S25). No antifibrotic therapy is avail￾able for patients with chronic cholestatic disorders (i.e., primary 
sclerosing cholangitis and PBC). Ursodeoxycholic acid improves 
biochemical tests in these patients, but its impact on fibrosis is 
not consistently proven (S26). In patients with NASH, weight loss 
and specific treatments of the metabolic syndrome can reduce 
fibrosis development (125). Recent reports have revealed than 
antioxidants and insulin sensitizers (e.g., thiazolindiones) may 
exert antifibrogenic effects in these patients (S27). Large clinical 
trials are needed to confirm these results.
Future directions
The translation of basic research into improved therapeutics for 
the management of patients with chronic liver diseases is still poor. 
The role of pluripotential stem cells in hepatic wound healing is 
one of the most promising fields. Perfusion of these cells may be 
a potential approach to promoting fibrosis resolution and liver 
regeneration. Approaches to removing fibrogenic cells are being 
evaluated, including development of drug delivery systems that 
target activated HSCs. Translational research should investigate 
the molecular mechanisms that cause fibrosis in different types of 
human liver diseases in order to identify new targets for therapy. 
In the clinical setting, the identity of the genetic determinants 
that influence fibrosis progression should be uncovered. Well￾designed large-scale epidemiological genetic studies are clearly 
required. Patients at a high risk of progression to cirrhosis should 
be identified. Developing simple and reliable noninvasive mark￾ers of hepatic fibrosis is an important goal in clinical hepatology 
and will facilitate the design of clinical trials. Most importantly, 
the efficacy of antifibrotic drugs known to attenuate experimental 
liver fibrosis should be tested in humans.
