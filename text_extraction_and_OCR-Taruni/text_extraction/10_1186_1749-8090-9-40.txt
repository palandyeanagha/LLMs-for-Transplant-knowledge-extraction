Abstract
We describe a very rare case of outflow cannula obstruction with fungal infectious thrombus formation. Discussion
includes the etiology, diagnosis, and management of fungal infection complications related with long-term mechanical
circulatory support. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used as bridge to transplant and permanent
long-term therapy in the population with end-stage heart failure. Even though better clinical outcomes have been
achieved with the newer-generation continuous-flow devices, infection complications are still a major risk for patients
with continuous-flow LVAD implantation in long-term follow-up [Ann Thorac Surg 90:1270-1277, 2010]. Device-related
infections can be categorized as driveline infections, pump-pocket infections, and LVAD-associated endocarditis
[Expert Rev Med Devices 8: 627-634, 2011]. The microbiological profile is very heterogeneous; the most common
pathogens are Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus species, and Candida. Severe fungal infection may
lead to dysfunction of the LVAD due to obstructive mass formation within the device. Due to the only anecdotal
reports in the current literature, we present a very rare case of outflow fungal infectious thrombus formation leading to
outflow cannula obstruction in patient with LVAD.

Background
Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly
used as bridge to transplant and permanent long-term
therapy in the population with end-stage heart failure.
Even though better clinical outcomes have been achieved
with the newer-generation continuous-flow devices, in￾fection complications are still a major risk for patients
with continuous-flow LVAD implantation in long-term
follow-up [1]. Device-related infections can be catego￾rized as driveline infections, pump-pocket infections,
and LVAD-associated endocarditis [2]. The microbiological
profile is very heterogeneous; the most common pathogens
are Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus species,
and Candida [1,2]. Severe fungal infection may lead to
dysfunction of the LVAD due to obstructive mass for￾mation within the device.
Case presentation
A 56-year-old caucasian male with dilated cardiomyopathy
was previously treated with an implantable cardiac defib￾rillator (ICD) as secondary prevention therapy (2002) and
with a combined system of cardiac resynchronization
therapy (CRT) and ICD—CRT/ICD therapy (2009) with
several infectious complications, which led to explantation
of the system and reimplantation of the CRT/ICD
(surgically implanted epicardial electrode; 2010).
The patient was admitted to our institution (12/2010)
from a referral hospital in cardiogenic shock with
arrhythmic storm triggered with incessant monomorphic
ventricular arrhythmia. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation
was unsuccessful, so urgent implantation of an LVAD—
HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA,
USA) was indicated. The procedure was performed in a
standard fashion under transesophageal echocardiogram
(TEE) guidance together with De Vega tricuspid valve
annuloplasty and cryodestruction of arrhythmogenic
substrate.
During the entire postoperative period, repeated life￾threatening septic complications were observed. The pa￾tient was treated gradually with antibiotics to 02/2011

(meropenem, linezolid, fluconazol, anidulafunginum, ce￾fepime, ampiciline, micafungin, piperacilline/tazobactam).
Computed tomography (CT) scans showed signs of
pulmonary interstitial pneumonia in both lungs from
12/2010 to 2/2011. During this period, it was necessary
to intubate the patient several times because of respiratory
insufficiency. Clinical signs of infection disappeared after
prolonged treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In
early 2/2011 CT scans, bronchoscopy with lavage, and
blood cultures were negative.
The patient also had repeated gastrointestinal bleeding
that required blood transfusion. Colonoscopy showed no
clear source of bleeding—inflammation and small sur￾face ulceration of the colon, two small sores in rectal
ampulla, and normal gastric fibroscopy. Parenteral nutri￾tion and intermittent nasogastric tube were used.
Following the gradual rehabilitation and education of
the patient about operating the LVAD equipment and
dressing the driveline exit site, he was discharged to
home. Calculated LVAD flow ranged between 5.0 and
6.0 L/min. During the entire duration of circulatory
support, no LVAD suction events were detected, pump
power consumption remained in the normal range (6 to
7.5 watts at pump speed 9,400 rpm), and the patient was
listed for heart transplantation. We did not observe any
signs of hemolysis; anticoagulation levels remained stable,
and the bilirubin levels throughout postoperative follow￾up were within normal range. The patient had no signs of
active systemic infection.
The patient was rehospitalized in 3/2011 due to worsen￾ing of his condition. He was afebrile, fatigued, had a dry
cough and brown discoloration of urine. Hemoglobinuria,
an increase of inflammatory markers, and mild alteration
in hepatic and renal function were detected. Initial blood
cultures were negative. Transthoracic echocardiogram
(TTE) and TEE imaging showed no obstruction of the
inflow or outflow cannulas, but there was a decrease
in flow velocities (inflow velocity = 35 cm/s; outflow
velocity = 70 cm/s). The left ventricle was severely di￾lated and hypokinetic. The aortic valve was opening at
1:1. Even at high-speed operation (11,600 rpm), the left
ventricle could not be unloaded with closure of the
aortic valve. Systemic thrombolysis was considered, but a
donor heart became available (patient was listed as an
urgent candidate) and heart transplantation was per￾formed in 4/2011. Examination of the explanted LVAD
revealed thrombotic-like obstruction of the outflow can￾nula (Figures 1 and 2). Histopathologic examination and
microbiological culturing of the mass have showed ex￾tensive fungal growth (Figure 3). The thrombus showed
fibrinous debris, scattered inflammatory cells, and hy￾phae with the presence of Aspergillus species.
The patient was discharged from the hospital eight
weeks after the transplantation. During the first 12 months,
patient was repeatedly hospitalized due to soft tissue
wound infections. Treatment consisted of soft tissue
debridement and V.A.C.® Therapy. Candida albicans
was culture-confirmed in multiple samples. Therefore,
the patient was aggressively treated with antifungal
therapy in the first three months with intrakonazol and
then treated for the next nine months with fluconazol.
Lower-dose corticosteroid protocol with 5 mg of pred￾nisone daily was administered. After one year, conver￾sion from sirolimus to everolimus was made because of
early signs of coronary artery disease in the donor
heart. During the two years follow-up, the patient was
monitored according to our institutional protocol with
regular cardiac biopsies and echocardiogram examina￾tions, without any signs of serious complications.
Discussion and conclusions
With increasing durations of LVAD support, the accurate
diagnosis of device malfunction is crucial [2]. Diagnosis
of fungemia is often difficult, and blood cultures are

negative in about half of the samples from patients with
active infection. To find the source of a fungal infection
and select the most appropriate treatment is often chal￾lenging. Fungal pathogens, most frequently Candida
species, can cause LVAD-associated endocarditis [2].
Unfortunately, the only clinical sign of a thrombotic
fungal infection is often fever or sepsis of unknown ori￾gin. TTE and TEE imaging are commonly used to fol￾low up LVAD patients [3]. Currently, the suggested
normal range for outflow graft velocities is 1.0–2.0 m/s.
Abnormal values can eventually identify device mal￾function along with overall evaluation of LVAD func￾tion, such as dilated left ventricle, rightward septal
shift, mitral regurgitation, or ejection through aortic
valve. In summary, pulsatile flow through the aortic
valve, low-velocity antegrade flow in outflow cannula
on TTE or TEE images, and thrombotic material de￾tected on CT scan can refine the diagnosis [4]. We can
also evaluate data from the HeartMate II controller,
such as speed, power, pulsatility index, and flow, which
relate to device function. In order to reveal graft ob￾struction, there was designed a complex examination
pattern, where the majority of previously mentioned
variables are incorporated - RAMP test [5]. However,
borderline echocardiographic findings together with clin￾ical status are not specific enough to identify outflow graft
fungal occlusion [4].
According to the recent guidelines, in our institution,
we administer fluconazol as a Candida infection prophy￾laxis to all LVAD paints, during high-risk periods. Asper￾gillosis prophylaxis is not routinely recommended. In
case of proved fungal infection the early initiation of
effective should be critical. Patients afflicted by Candida
endocarditis should be immediately treated with echino￾candin. In patients with suspected invasive aspergillosis
voriconazole is administered as the first choice therapy
[6]. Here should be emphasized that eradication of per￾sistent fungemia in patient with implanted LVAD is
nearly impossible without its removal.
In our case, the major pathogen was Aspergillus species,
which was identified through histopathological methods.
Clinical manifestation of Aspergillus infection is uncom￾mon. When it does occur, it is almost always in the setting
with an immunocompromised patient. Filamentous fungi
as a pathogen are infrequently associated with device
infection. In earlier presented case series of Aspergillus
infections in LVAD patients, there was clinical evidence of
outflow-tract obstruction related to overwhelming device
infection similar to our case. Current imaging techniques,
either CT scan or echocardiography, were limited in their
ability to exactly detect LVAD-associated endocarditis
in our patient. Definitive diagnosis was established from
species identification of the obstructive mass in the internal
surface of the outflow cannula following explantation of
the device. It should be stressed that tissue specimens
from the device must always undergo histopathological
examination.
Current data are limited, but it is confirmed that com￾bined medical and surgical therapy generally should
be the preferred treatment for fungal endocarditis. Al￾though there are no currently available evidence-based
guidelines regarding LVAD endocarditis, we believe that
clinical decision-making in patients with signs of on￾going sepsis and end-organ dysfunction together with
any signs of LVAD malfunction should be very straight￾forward in terms of device exchange or explantation. In
patients with VADs and severe fungal infection who can￾not be explanted electively, an urgent transplant listing
plays key role. Due to organ donors shortage VAD
exchange via left subcostal incision is increasingly used.
