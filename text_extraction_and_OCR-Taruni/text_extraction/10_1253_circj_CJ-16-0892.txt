after LT have already been identified whereas those of late 
AA are still unknown. Whether AA after LT has an effect 
mortality and the optimal strategy of rhythm management 
are still being debated.7–9
The purpose of our study was to assess in a large cohort 
of LT patients the incidence, management and outcome of 
AA early and late after surgery, the predictive factors and 
effect on mortality.
Methods
Study Design
All consecutive patients who underwent LT between 
January 2005 and December 2014 were prospectively 
followed at the Nouvel Hôpital Civil of Strasbourg, 
Atrial arrhythmias (AAs) are commonly observed 
immediately after thoracic surgery and may occur 
in up to 20–40% of procedures.1–3 Postoperative 
AAs are related to age, hypertension, stress, use of inotropes 
or postoperative pain, and are associated with longer 
hospital stay and deaths.1,4
The incidence of AA is higher after lung transplantation 
(LT) than after heart transplantation, in part because of 
cardiac autonomic denervation.5 LT patients are usually 
younger with less cardiovascular risk factors than patients 
undergoing other thoracic surgery.6 AAs are observed 
early and also late after LT. Double LT is associated with 
long-term freedom from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 
(AF).7 Atrial tachycardias, focal or macroreentrant are 
probably related to surgical lines around the pulmonary 
veins (PVs) between the donor and the recipient left

Background: Atrial arrhythmias (AAs) are frequent after lung transplantation (LT) and late postoperatively. Several predictive factors 
of early postoperative AAs after LT have been identified but those of late AAs remain unknown. Whether AA after LT affects mortality 
is still being debated. This study assessed in a large cohort of LT patients the incidence of AAs early and late after surgery, their 
predictive factors and their effect on mortality.
Methods and Results: We studied 271 consecutive LT patients over 9 years. Mean follow-up was 2.9±2.4 years. 33% patients 
developed postoperative AAs. Age (odds ratio (OR) 2.35; confidence interval (CI) [1.31–4.24]; P=0.004) and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (OR 2.13; CI [1.12–4.03]; P=0.02) were independent predictive factors of early AAs. Late AAs occurred 2.2±2.7 
years after transplant in 8.8% of the patients. Pretransplant systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PTsPAP) was the only independent 
predictive factor of late AA (OR 1.028; CI [1.001–1.056]; P=0.04). Double LT was associated with long-term freedom from atrial 
fibrillation (AF) but not from atrial flutter (AFL). Early and late AAs after surgery had no effect on mortality. Double LT was associated 
with better survival.
Conclusions: Early AA following LT is common in contrast with the low occurrence of late, often organized, AA. Early and late AAs 
do not affect mortality. PTsPAP is an independent predictor of late AA. Double LT protects against late AF but not AFL.

postoperatively and every 3 months thereafter.
Surgery
A single-center transplantation team performed all the 
interventions. There was no change in surgical technique 
during the study period. The PVs were removed from the 
donor heart, including an atrial muscular skirt. The donor 
right and left PVs were then separated, and excess tissue 
was trimmed. Each side was sutured on the recipient 
atrium cross-clamped. The need for cardiopulmonary 
bypass during surgery depended on surgeon choice. The 
following operative information was collected: cold ischemic 
time for each lung, conditions of high emergency allocation, 
perioperative arrhythmias, need for cardiopulmonary 
bypass during surgery or extracorporeal membrane oxy￾genation support (ECMO) after transplantation, need for 
plasty of the left atrium (because of an excessively short 
muscular skirt), and use of epidural catheter for pain 
management.
Definitions
Early AAs were defined as any occurrence of postoperative 
AF or atrial flutter (AFL) documented by 12-lead ECG or 
telemetry monitoring during the first postoperative month. 
Late AAs were defined as AF or AFL occurring after 1 
month post-transplantation and documented by 12-lead 
ECG or ambulatory ECG monitoring.
France and were included in this study. Heart-lung trans￾plantations were excluded. This study was conducted 
under a general patient record review protocol approved 
by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Ouest 1-Tours 
(reference no. 2009-A00036-51). All patients gave informed 
written consent to participate in the clinical study.
Data Collection
Preoperative data included patient and donor character￾istics, indication for transplantation, cardiovascular risk 
factors, pretransplant arrhythmias or structural heart 
disease (coronary artery disease or left ventricular ejection 
fraction ≤40%), preoperative transthoracic echocardiogra￾phy, right heart catheterization and coronary angiography, 
and medications (antiarrhythmics, inhaled bronchodilators, 
immunosuppressors, anticoagulants). In the postoperative 
period, the presence of ST elevation, troponin peak, dura￾tion of mechanic ventilation, and length of hospital stay 
were evaluated.
During follow-up, recurrence of any form of AA was 
recorded from the time of surgery to the end of follow-up. 
Further outcome events, including graft rejection and 
thromboembolic events, were recorded.
All patients had continuous cardiac monitoring for at 
least 30 days postoperatively in the intermediate care unit 
(ICU). Patients were then followed-up initially once weekly 
for 3 three months, then on a monthly-basis until 1 year

body mass index (BMI) and thoracic perimeters. Patients 
with early AAs had more hypertension, structural heart 
disease, smoking history and higher right atrial pressure. 
There were age differences among patients with various 
pulmonary diseases before LT. Cystic fibrosis patients 
were younger with less early AAs.
Echocardiographic and transplantation data were not 
significantly different between the 2 groups. Early AF 
occurred in 28% of double LT and in 35% of single LT 
patients (P=NS). Postoperative length of hospital stay was 
not longer in the early AA group.
Of all the patients who presented with early AAs, 92% 
received treatment for rhythm control. Amiodarone was 
used in 78% of the patients according to hospital protocol 
(typically 900mg intravenous loading dose over 1 day 
followed by a tapering dose and an oral maintenance dose 
of 200mg); 10% of patients underwent electrical cardiover￾sion. One patient underwent cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. 
Antiarrhythmia treatment was ceased after a mean of 
70±12 days. Heparin and vitamin K antagonist (fluindione) 
were initiated in 48% of the patients for a mean duration 
of 3.4±2.2 months. No major bleeding complications were 
recorded. At hospital discharge, all patients except 1 were 
in sinus rhythm. No pulmonary complications linked to 
amiodarone use were reported.
On univariate analysis, age, BMI, thoracic perimeter, 
hypertension, smoking habits, structural heart disease and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were 
associated with an increased risk of early AA following LT 
(Table 3).
Conversely, pretransplant AA, systolic pulmonary artery 
pressure (sPAP), left atrial size, troponin peak, acute 
rejection and double LT were not associated with an 
increased risk of early AAs. The use of epidural catheter 
for pain management was not associated with a lower risk 
of early AAs.
On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of early 
AAs were age (odds ratio [OR] 2.35; confidence interval 
[CI] (1.31–4.24); P=0.004) and COPD (OR 2.13; CI (1.12–
4.03); P=0.02).
Late AAs 
Out of 271 (8.8%) patients, 24 presented with AAs late 
All ECGs were reviewed by 2 cardiologists, including 1 
electrophysiologist, and the rhythm was classified as sinus, 
AF, typical AFL, or atypical AFL. Typical AFL was 
defined by organized inverted flutter waves in the inferior 
leads (with fixed cycle length) and positive in V1. Atypical 
AFL was defined by organized P-wave activity that did not 
fulfill the criteria for typical AFL.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables are expressed as count and percent￾ages. Continuous variables are reported as mean and SD. 
Categorical variables were compared with chi-square test 
or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were compared 
with the use of the Mann-Whitney test. To determine 
predictors of early and late AAs, and death, Cox-regression 
analysis was performed. Variables with P<0.1 in the 
univariate analysis were entered into the Cox multivariate 
regression analysis. Survival was graphically displayed 
according to the Kaplan-Meier method with comparison 
of cumulative survival rate by the log-rank test. All tests 
were two-sided. P<0.05 was considered significant. Calcu￾lations were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patients’ Characteristics
Over a 9-year period, 271 LT patients were followed for a 
mean of 2.9±2.4 years; 9 patients died during surgery, and 
76 patients died during follow-up. The mean age at time of 
LT was 49.5±14.5 years and 61% were male.
Double LT was performed in 82% of cases whereas 
single LT was done in 18% of cases, mostly before 2009. 
Baseline characteristics are outlined in Table 1. Indications 
for transplantation are summarized in Table 2.
Early AAs
In the study, 89 (33%) patients developed early postop￾erative AAs. Of these patients, 79 (89%) presented with AF 
and 10 (11%) with AFL (53% typical aspect). The mean 
time to early postoperative AA onset after LT was 7±8 
days.
The early AA group was significantly older with higher

Atrial Arrhythmias After Lung Transplantation 663
Of the patients who developed late AF, 10 (91%) were 
treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (8 with amiodarone, 1 
with sotalol and 1 with flecainide). In 1 patient cardiover￾sion was required.
Of the patients who developed late AFL, 11 (85%) were 
treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (6 amiodarone, 1 sotalol, 
4 flecainide+β-blockers). Cardioversion was required in 6 
cases; 4 patients were referred for an electrophysiology 
study: in 3 cases, counterclockwise tricuspid isthmus￾dependent flutter was diagnosed, with successful ablation, 
and 1 case of a left-sided flutter for which the patient 
refused left atrial ablation and subsequent cardioversion 
was performed.
On univariate analysis, age, BMI, structural heart disease, 
sPAP, and early AA were associated with an increased risk 
of AAs late after LT. Conversely, pretransplant AF, single 
LT or double LT, and acute and chronic transplant rejec￾tion were not significantly associated with AAs late after 
LT.
On multivariate analysis, the only predictor of AAs late 
after LT was sPAP before transplant (OR 1.028; CI 
after transplant. Only 3/24 (12.5%) patients had a history 
of AF before transplantation; 15/24 (62.5%) patients had 
also sustained early postoperative AAs. Of these 24 patients, 
11 presented with AF and 13 with AFL (4 typical AFL, 6 
atypical AFL, 3 that were only documented on ambulatory 
ECG monitoring and were undifferentiated).
Late AAs occurred 2.2±2.7 years after LT (2.7±2.7 years 
in AF group, 1.7±1.6 years in AFL group; P=NS). Among 
the patients presenting with AFL, 11/13 (85%) were double 
LT patients. Among the patients presenting with AF, 45% 
(5/11) were single LT, and 55% (6/11) were double LT.
Among all single LT patients, 10.4% presented with late 
AF vs. 2.7% in the double LT group (P=0.014). There was 
no difference in the rate of AFL between single LT and 
double LT patients (4.2% vs. 5%, respectively; P=NS).
The Kaplan-Meier analysis for the development of late 
AF demonstrated that double LT was associated with 
long-term freedom from AF compared with single LT 
(P=0.05), but there was no significant difference for the 
development of late AFL in the 2 groups of LT patients 
(Figure 1).

approach for treatment of paroxysmal AF.10 Only one of 
200 double LT patients in the study by Lee et al, and 0 of 
127 in the study by See et al had AF recurrence. Similarly, 
we found that double LT was protective against AF 
recurrence but not against AFL. We observed double LT 
patients with late AF. This can be explained by AF triggers 
located outside the PVs, for example, elsewhere in the PV 
antrum (extent being dependent on surgery) or in the left 
or right atrium.11 Electrical PV reconnection across 
anastomotic suture lines or microreentry at the suture sites 
could also explain the recurrences.12
Among the late AFL recurrences, 85% were in double 
LT patients. As the PVs are isolated from surgery, macro￾reentry can occur. Typical and atypical flutters were 
observed. Only 4 patients underwent electrophysiological 
study, and 3 CTI-dependent flutters and 1 left AFL were 
diagnosed. See et al also described 4 patients who underwent 
electrophysiological study, with 1 CTI, 2 left-sided macro￾reentrant tachycardia, and 1 focal atrial tachycardia being 
diagnosed.2 Catheter ablation may indeed be useful in this 
category of LT patients with recurrent AFL.
Interestingly, in our cohort the only predictive factor for 
late AA was raised PAP before LT, which theoretically 
could also predispose to CTI-dependent flutter. In the 
study by See et al no predictive factors for late AA could 
be identified. Several studies have shown that pulmonary 
arterial hypertension induces right atrial remodeling, 
predisposing to supra-ventricular tachycardia.13,14
In contrast to heart transplantation, where AF is associ￾ated with rejection and myocardial dysfunction.5 in LT 
there is no observable relationship between acute or 
chronic rejection and AA.
If the incidence of late AA after transplant is low and 
predictive factors difficult to identify, conversely postop￾erative AA is more common. Age is regularly identified as 
a predictive factor.2,4,6
The incidence of early postoperative AA in our LT 
population was 33%. Nielsen et al reported a higher 
incidence of 39% in a cohort of similar age with similar 
catheter for pain management and double LT were associ￾ated with a lower long-term mortality risk (Table 5).
On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of 
increased long-term mortality were need for ECMO after 
surgery and hospital length of stay. Conversely, double LT 
was identified as an independent predictor of long-term 
survival (OR 0.466; 95% CI [0.230–0.943]; P=0.034) 
(Table 5). The Kaplan-Meier analysis for survival demon￾strates a beneficial effect of double LT (Figure 2).
There was no significant effect of early postoperative 
AAs and late AAs after surgery on long-term mortality 
(Figure 3).
Discussion
In the present study, early postoperative AA was observed 
to occur frequently in up to 33% of cases, and was not 
associated with adverse outcomes. Postoperative AA was 
more likely to occur in older patients with COPD. AA late 
after LT was uncommon (8.8%). Double LT seemed to 
protect against late AF but not against late AFL recurrence. 
Pretransplant sPAP was the only predictive factor of late 
AA after surgery. Early or late AAs after surgery were not 
associated with increased mortality. Double LT was asso￾ciated with better survival.
Whether double LT could protect against atrial arrhyth￾mia recurrence was suggested by Lee et al.7 In their study, 
AF occurred in 5.5% (17/327) of patients 2.9 years after 
transplant. Organized AA was also identified in addition 
to AF. In our study, the high incidence of early postopera￾tive AA contrasts with the low occurrence of late AA 
(8.8%), consistent with previous findings. Our observation 
substantiates the view of a bimodal distribution of AA 
following LT, as originally described by See et al2 who 
also depicted the greater proportion of organized atrial 
tachycardia compared with AF more than 1 year after 
transplant.
The surgical technique for LT involves surgical antral 
isolation of the PVs. PV isolation is the recommended

In our study, double LT was predictive of increased 
survival. Schaffer et al showed that double LT was associ￾ated with better graft survival than single LT in patients 
with idiopathic fibrosis, whereas in the COPD population, 
no survival difference between single LT and double LT 
recipients at 5 years could be evidenced.22 An ongoing 
debate remains between proponents of single LT and 
double LT for end-stage pulmonary disease.23
Study Limitations
There are several limitations that should be considered. 
This was a retrospective single-center study of patients 
who had uniform surgical procedures and postoperative 
management. Although the cohort was large, the retro￾spective analysis may have underestimated the prevalence 
of AAs. Subclinical episodes of late AA may have been 
missed even if particular care concerning arrhythmias were 
undertaken during the follow-up period.
Systolic PAP measured by TTE was predictive of late 
AA after transplantation but right heart catheterization 
parameters were not. The delay between catheterization, 
often done prior to registration of a patient on the LT 
waiting list, and transplantation can be long. TTE system￾atically done before transplantation may reflect the dete￾rioration in patient state with the highest PAP recorded 
before transplantation.
Conclusions
Early postoperative AAs following LT are common and 
often transient, in contrast to the low occurrence of late 
and often organized AAs. Early and late AAs do not affect 
mortality following LT. Double LT compared with single 
LT, analogous to PV isolation, protected against late AF 
but not AFL, underlying the role of the PVs in the genesis 
of AF. Pretransplant sPAP was an independent predictor 
of late AA after surgery.

proportion of double LT (82% vs. 79%).1 Henri et al6
reported a lower incidence of 29%, which was explained by 
a younger age and a lower proportion of double LT (56%). 
Henri et al initially observed that double LT was predictive 
of postoperative AF.6 After a statistically adjusted model 
using the year of transplant, they also found that double 
LT was not any more predictive of postoperative AF on 
multivariate analysis. In our study, double LT was not 
associated with postoperative AA. Lee et al also found that 
early postoperative AF occurred in equal proportions in 
single LT and double LT populations.7
Arrhythmia pretransplant was also found to be predictive 
of postoperative AA.2,4 For Henri et al, these findings are 
dependent on the statistical model.6
It has been suggested that mechanisms favoring postop￾erative AF are multifactorial, and not dependent on PV 
triggers.2,15,16 Inflammation has been associated with AF17
and its implications following thoracic surgery has been 
extensively studied.18 Pericardial inflammation after surgery, 
variation in left and right atrial pressures, changes in 
oxygenation, pain and stress may influence atrial conduc￾tion and refractory periods, predisposing to AF. The factors 
related to thoracic surgery may decrease during the recovery 
phase, usually during the first month, and may relate to 
atrial electrical reverse remodeling. Postoperative AAs are 
mostly transient and 99% of the patients return to sinus 
rhythm before discharge. In our study, length of stay and 
in-hospital death were not increased in the early AA group. 
We found that early postoperative AA was neither a risk 
factor for in-hospital death nor for overall long-term 
mortality. These findings are corroborated by Henri et al 
who also found that postoperative AF had no impact on 
mortality. Similar to our study, the strategy of rhythm 
control was most frequently chosen (97%), with nearly all 
patients in sinus rhythm upon discharge. No amiodarone￾related lung toxicity was noted. Conversely, Orrego et al4
chose a rhythm strategy in only 50% of patients and found 
a higher mortality in the rhythm control group (amiodarone/
propafenone) compared with the rate control group. 
Isiadinso et al observed a negative effect of amiodarone on 
short-term mortality in the postoperative AF group, but 
the cohort comprised heart and lung transplant patients.9
Postoperative AF in heart transplant patients carries 
different clinical implications and is related to death and 
rejection.19 Recently, Gillinov et al compared rate vs. 
rhythm control for AF after cardiac surgery and showed 
no net clinical advantage of 1 treatment strategy over the 
other.20 In our experience, rhythm control strategy was 
used in the majority of patients without significant compli￾cations and could constitute a reasonable first-line approach 
for these patients.
In our study, early postoperative AA had no effect on 
in-hospital and long-term mortality. Late AA after LT was 
also not associated with increased mortality. Predictive 
factors for in-hospital death were PAP and high emergency 
transplantation, reflecting the more serious clinical preop￾erative state of the patient. These factors are not frequently 
reported in the literature. In addition, Henri et al found 
that postoperative vasopressor use was predictive of death. 
In our study, hospital length of stay following transplanta￾tion and ECMO support were predictive of overall long￾term mortality. Sabashnikov et al recently identified that 
intraoperative conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass and 
ECMO support was strongly associated with increased 
mortality.21
