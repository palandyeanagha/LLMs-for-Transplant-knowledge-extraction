Abstract
OBJECTIVE To determine baseline predictors of tolerance to the α/
β blocker carvedilol in everyday clinical practice.
DESIGN Retrospective analysis of tolerance to carvedilol in patients
with chronic heart failure. Tolerance was defined as currently on
carvedilol or on it at the time of death or heart transplantation. To
meet the criteria for tolerance, carvedilol had to be prescribed at a
stable dose for ⩾ 3 months.
SETTING Everyday clinical practice, comprising both hospital
specialist practice and private practice. Tolerance was assessed in
all patients prescribed carvedilol for chronic heart failure in those
practices.
PATIENTS 808 consecutive patients in both hospital specialist (611
patients) and private practice (197 patients).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Baseline predictors of tolerance
assessed by proportional hazards analysis. Both univariate and
multivariate analyses were performed.
RESULTS Within the entire cohort of 808 patients, 95 had stopped
carvedilol, 606 were currently receiving the drug, 50 had died, and
44 had received a heart transplant. Overall, 88% of patients
tolerated carvedilol (87% in the hospital specialist group, 92% in
the private practitioner group). Factors that indicated impaired
tolerance by univariate analysis were increased age in years (hazard
ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 1.3), low diastolic
blood pressure (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08), and raised
plasma urea concentration (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05).
New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was also a marker of
tolerance (proportion not tolerated: 3% class I; 9% class II; 13%
class III, 22% class IV). By multivariate analysis, no single baseline
variable was an independent marker of inability to tolerate
carvedilol. Tolerance was also assessed in relation to traditional
precautions or relative contraindications to β blockade. Tolerance
in these subgroups was: chronic obstructive airways disease/asthma
85% (89 patients), diabetes 86% (127 patients), peripheral vascular


disease 84% (58 patients), concomitant amiodarone treatment 83%
(230 patients), and heart rate < 70 beats/min 84% (184 patients).
CONCLUSIONS β Blocker treatment was well tolerated in everyday
clinical practice, including non-hospital-based private practice.
There was no single predictor of poor tolerance on multivariate
analysis, although there was a clear association with NYHA class as
well as age, diastolic blood pressure, and plasma urea on univariate
analysis. Carvedilol was tolerated well among selected patients with
traditional contraindications to β blockade in this situation.
