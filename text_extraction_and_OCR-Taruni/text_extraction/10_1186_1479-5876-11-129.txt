Abstract
Background: Deceased after cardiac arrest donor are an additional source of kidney graft to overcome graft
shortage. Deciphering the respective role of renal warm and cold ischemia is of pivotal interest in the
transplantation process.
Methods: Using a preclinical pig model of renal auto-transplantation, we investigated the consequences of warm
and cold ischemia on early innate and adaptive responses as well as graft outcome. Kidneys were subjected to
either 60 min-warm ischemia (WI) or auto-transplanted after cold storage for 24 h at 4°C (CS), or both conditions
combined (WI + CS). Renal function, immune response and cytokine expression, oxidative stress and cell death were
investigated at 3 h, 3 and 7 days (H3, D3 and D7) after reperfusion. At 3 months, we focused on cell infiltration and
tissue remodelling.
Results: WI + CS induced a delayed graft function linked to higher tubular damage. Innate response occurred at D3
associated to a pro-oxidative milieu with a level dependent on the severity of ischemic injury whereas adaptive
immune response occurred only at D7 mainly due to CS injuries and aggravated by WI. Graft cellular death was an
early event detected at H3 and seems to be one of the first ischemia reperfusion injuries. These early injuries affect
graft outcome on renal function, cells infiltration and fibrosis development.
Conclusions: The results indicate that the severe ischemic insult found in kidneys from deceased after cardiac
arrest donor affects kidney outcome and promotes an uncontrolled deleterious innate and adaptive response not
inhibited 3 months after reperfusion.

Background
In organ transplantation, graft shortage increases mor￾bidity on dialysis; prolongs waiting times for adults and
urges transplant physicians to accept new source of or￾gans. Donor deceased after cardiac death (DCD), is an
additional potential source of kidney graft which is more
prone to severe ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), pri￾mary non-function (PNF), and delayed graft function
(DGF). In such donors, different ischemic conditions are
associated such as warm ischemia (WI) and cold ischemia
(CS) characterized respectively by an ischemic period at
body temperature initiated by cardiac arrest ensuing a low
and/or no blood flow and by a hypothermic preservation
of kidneys. However, the respective role of WI and CS in
transplantation conditions needs to be clarified to improve
the use of graft from DCD, particularly from uncontrolled
donors (class I, II and V of Maastricht classification). Con￾sequently, researches into the mechanisms of WI, CS, and
IRI are necessary to maximise the use of available donor
pool and to minimise the PNF and DGF.

We and other have previously demonstrated that is￾chemia reperfusion sequence involved in renal auto￾transplantation model induces inflammatory processes
that are independent of the presence of allo-antigen [1,2]
and characterized by both innate and adaptive immune
responses [2-4]. The pathophysiology of renal transplant￾ation process involves a complex interplay among vascu￾lar, tubular, and inflammatory factors followed by a repair
process or progressive fibrotic chronic kidney disease
when it persists. The complex interplay between innate
and adaptive immunity is still not completely understood
and the chronological response related to the severity of
graft lesions needs to be clarified. There is also a strong
body of evidence that the consequences of IRI are identifi￾able in an increased acute rejection rate [5,6].
In ischemic research, most experiments are carried
out on rodents, but crucial prerequisites for the develop￾ment of safe clinical protocols are needed through suit￾able large animal models like pig [7,8]. Because the renal
porcine anatomy and vascular bed are very similar with
human, we used a porcine autologous renal transplant
model. In addition, such model is an ideal situation for
tolerance and allows focusing on IRI effects per se.
We hypothesize that the ischemic period is a crucial
time point which is involved in the initial development
of chronic graft injuries observed in the first months of
reperfusion and that WI before transplantation induces
an uncontrolled response which promotes a worst graft
outcome. Thus, we propose to decipher the respective
influences of CS and WI in a preclinical model of kidney
transplantation on innate and adaptive response with a
high degree of translation to the clinic, in an attempt to
determine the chronology of lesion development and
find the most discriminating markers and time windows
to evaluate graft quality.
To this end, we have developed and validated different
models to decipher WI and cold preservation injuries
and the combined effect of these conditions enabling a
step by step study [9-13]. The goal of the present work
was to study the modulation of an ischemic preclinical
model combining 60 min WI and 24 h CS followed by
transplantation mimicking different clinical situations
found in uncontrolled donors and particularly to de￾cipher the innate and adaptive responses between WI
and CS to easily manage the pharmacological approach.
Methods
Surgical procedure and experimental groups
We used a well controlled model of large white male
pigs weighting 30 to 35 kg [2]. The surgical and experi￾mental protocols were performed in accordance with the
institutional committee for the use and care of labora￾tory animals: COMETHEA (CEEA Poitou-Charentes,
project reference numbers: CE2012-4 and CE2012-29).
We determined 3 experimental conditions deciphering
WI, CS and combination of WI and CS: 1. WI: 60 min
in vivo ischemia by renal pedicle clamping without
transplantation to mimic clinical situation of no-reflow
(n = 12); 2. CS: kidney was removed, cold flushed, pre￾served at 4°C for 24 h in UW and autotransplanted
(n = 12); 3. WI + CS: kidneys were subjected to both con￾ditions to mimic DCD (n = 12). In each experimental
group, the controlateral kidney was removed to mimic the
graft nephron mass found in clinical situation. Reperfu￾sion was studied at: 3 hours (H3), 3 and 7 days (D3 and
D7), and 3 months (M3) with pig sacrifice at each time
point. Native kidney is also used as control group.
Renal function determination
Urinary and plasma sodium for fractional excretion of
sodium (FeNa+
) evaluation were determined at H0, H3,
D3 and D7. Plasma creatinin was measured at H0, H3,
D3 and D7 and M3 after reperfusion and urinary protein
excretion was determined at M3 after reperfusion using
an automated chemistry analyzer (Modular, Roche Diag￾nostics, France).
Histochemical and immunohistochemical study
Histochemistry for tubular atrophy and Red Sirius staining
on cortex samples was performed as previously described
[2]. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using
anti-CD3 (Cell marque Corporation, USA), and anti-ED1
(AbD Serotec, USA). All sections were examined under
blind conditions by a pathologist. Apoptotic signals were
characterized by immunostaining using anti-cleaved cas￾pase 3 antibodies (R&D System, USA).
Real-time quantitative PCR
We used RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, France). Genomic
DNA was removed using DNA-free kit (Applied Bio￾systems, USA) and first-strand reverse transcription was
performed. Real-Time PCR assays were performed on an
ABI Prism 7300 (Applied Biosystems) with porcine
primers (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Western blot analysis
Western Blotting was carried out according to standard
protocols [14] using specific antibodies against superoxide
dismutase-1, transforming growth factor β, pro-matrix
metalloproteinase-2, tissue plasminogen activator (SOD-1,
TGFβ, pro-MMP-2, tPa, Santa Cruz, USA), pSmad3
(pSmad3, Cell signalling, France), monocyte chemo￾attractive protein-1 (MCP-1, Clinisciences, France), bone
morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7, AbD Serotec, France),
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, BD-Bioscience,
USA) and loading control: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate de￾hydrogenase or β actin (GAPDH, βactin, Sigma Aldrich,
France).

Statistical analysis
Values are reported as the mean ± SEM. Statistical dif￾ferences between groups were calculated using ANOVA
followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test or Kruskal
Wallis test for multiple comparison analysis. Correlation
analysis was performed with NCSS software (NCSS LLC,
USA), r2 is displayed and significance established with
the Spearman rank test. p < 0.05 was considered as
significant.
Results
Severe IRI affects early renal function in preclinical model
WI increased CS-induced delayed graft function recov￾ery and chronic dysfunction. A significant increase in
creatininemia was observed in experimental groups sub￾jected to ischemia from H3 maintained at D3, with the
highest level attained in WI + CS (Table 1). Although in￾dependently, WI and CS groups partially restored their
renal function at D7, whereas WI + CS creatinin levels
were still elevated. FeNa+ showed poor tubular function
in CS group, compared to some dysfunctions in WI and
highest FeNa+ in WI + CS group (Table 1). At M3, a sig￾nificant increase in creatininemia was observed in ische￾mic groups, with the highest level reached in WI + CS,
followed by CS alone (Table 1). Proteinuria showed the
same pattern (Table 1).
Severe ischemia induces a pro-oxidative milieu and
cell death
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase
(NADPH oxidase) is an important generator of super￾oxide anion during inflammatory processes mainly
expressed by endothelial cells and neutrophils [15]. We
investigated the mRNA expression of two NADPH oxi￾dase subunits: gp91phox and p47phox (Figure 1a). While
WI did not induce an up regulation, cold preserved
grafts exhibited a higher expression from D3 related to
the intensity of injury. In contrast to gp91phox subunit,
the p47phox seemed to be early expressed at H3 in the
severe ischemic group WI + CS (Figure 1a). The decrease
of SOD1 protein expression, a major antioxidant en￾zyme, was significant at D3 and D7 in CS group and
more pronounced in WI + CS group at D3 (Figure 1b).
The apoptotic and necrotic processes are early associ￾ated with ischemic conditions. Tubular necrosis was early
observed in all studied group at H3 and maintained at D7
compared to control (Figure 1c). The WI + CS group was
characterized by early high cleaved caspase 3 staining; less
marked in WI and CS groups (Figure 1d). At D7, CS and
WI + CS groups exhibited a high expression of cleaved
caspase 3 in contrast to the basal values observed in WI
group (Figure 1d).
Early innate and adaptive immunity depend on the
severity of IRI
P-selectin was temporary expressed in cold ischemia
groups at H3 and D3 supporting an early and transient
endothelial activation after cold ischemia (Figure 2a).
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and particularly TLR2 and 4
are central in the early activation of the innate immune
response in the setting of IRI [16,17]. TLR4 mRNA ex￾pression was early increased at H3, to similarly high
levels in CS and WI + CS, while remaining low in WI
(Figure 2b). TLR2 mRNA was up-regulated in CS at D3
and higher in WI + CS, a trend was maintained at D7
(Figure 2b). In our study, MCP-1 protein expression was
increased from D3 to D7 in WI + CS group (Figure 2c).
IL1β was up-regulated early (H3, Figure 2d), but only
WI + CS grafts showed maintained expression at D3 and
D7. IL6 was similarly up-regulated (Figure 2d). High
mRNA expression of IL-1Rn, the interleukin-1 receptor
antagonist (IL-1RA), was detected in WI + CS grafts at
D3 (Figure 2e). Expression remained above control
values at D7 but was not discriminating between

experimental groups exposed to CS condition. Warm is￾chemic kidneys did not show up regulation of IL-1Rn
expression. IL-10 expression was also absent in WI
group (Figure 2e), while CS and WI + CS grafts showed
consistent overexpression at different studied times of
reperfusion.
ED1+ cells infiltration started early at D3 with higher
intensity in CS and WI + CS. At D7, this process indi￾cated potential macrophages phagocytosis gradually de￾veloping in relation with the severity of IRI [18,19]
(Figure 2f ). In turn, a drastic CD3+ lymphocyte invasion
was recorded in CS groups with a higher degree in
WI + CS group only at D7 in contrast to baseline level in
WI (Figure 2f ).
Warm ischemia increases cold storage-induced immune
response, tubular injury and fibrotic response in the long
term
At 3 months after reperfusion, WI + CS maintained a high
recruitment of ED1+ cells in renal tissue (Figure 3c).
These results were supported by VCAM-1 and MCP-1 ex￾pressions (Figure 3a-b). Lymphocytes recruitment was
also preserved in WI + CS group (Figure 3c). In addition, a
single clamp of renal artery induced an important tubular
atrophy accentuated in CS condition, and upgraded when
WI is combined to CS (Figure 3e). This response was as￾sociated with extracellular matrix and collagen produc￾tion, with a severe grading in the WI + CS condition up to
45% (Figure 3e). This response was supported by pro￾Figure 1 Intensive ischemic injury induces early pro oxidative milieu. The mRNA expressions of p47phox and gp91phox (a), and protein

fibrotic pathways activation (Figure 3d). Indeed, TGFβ ex￾pression tends towards increased in WI + CS group sup￾ported by significant up-regulation of its downstream
mediator pSmad3 and down-expression of its inhibitor
BMP-7. In fact, CS group exhibited an increased expres￾sion of BMP-7 which failed when WI was combined. The
same pattern was observed with tPA which could be at￾tenuated by PAI-1. Indeed, we observed an up-regulation
of PAI-1 in WI + CS well known to inhibited tPA and fa￾vored renal extracellular matrix deposition accentuated by
a decrease of MMP-2 expression.
Adaptive response affects early and chronic graft function
Although, the inflammatory process mediated by mono￾cytes and lymphocytes recruitment is correlated with the
severity of ischemic injuries induced by warm and cold
ischemia and the combined conditions (Figure 4a-c),
only the number of CD3+ cells invading the renal tissue
is correlated with plasma creatinin at D7 and correlated
with the intensity of collagen expression at 3 months
(Figure 4b-d).
Discussion
The worldwide shortage of standard brain dead donors
has revived the use of kidneys from DCD. Therefore,
with the required framework, DCD kidney transplant
programs were reintroduced at the turn of the century.
Experimental approach clearly defined that ischemic
period is a crucial time which affects organ outcome
[20]. Since 1994, we developed several pre-clinical pig
models mimicking clinical situations. The aim of this
study was to decipher the deleterious effects induced in
organ from DCD conditions to improve and adapt graft
preservation. A previous study described the effect of
both WI and CS in ex-vivo porcine model without a sep￾arated analysis of each condition [21]. In addition in this

activation (a). Innate immunity markers like Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 mRNA (b), MCP-1 protein (c), IL-1β and IL-6 cytokines mRNA (d)
were investigated in kidney tissue. IL-1Rn and IL-10 cytokine mRNA expressions were also explored (e). The numbers of positively ED1 and CD3
stained cells per surface area (104

) was counted on five different tissue sections for each experimental conditions (f). Shown are mean ± SEM.

report, the renal function was measured over a period of
3 hours. In our study, three types of IRI and their re￾spective roles were compared: WI accompanied by no￾reflow condition (shock, cardiac or aortic surgery or
asystolic time) and CS involved in transplantation
process, potentially preceded by WI in DCD conditions.
In these conditions, the inflammatory and immune re￾sponse which are key processes involved in repair as well
as in chronic kidney fibrosis were studied at 3 hr, 3 days
and 7 days for early stage after reperfusion and also at
3 months [22].
During the first week of reperfusion, renal function in
groups exposed to CS was more affected than in WI
group. Our auto-transplant setting is an emblematic
situation of tolerance, in which IRI per se can break this
tolerance and destines the graft to a degraded chronic
outcome. The initiation of immune response appears in
the early hours in an identical fashion in all conditions;
however it is maintained and will expand in proportion
to the level of injury, supporting the concept of immun￾ity is a solid discriminatory tool between damage inten￾sities. Interestingly, we correlated the number of adaptive
immune cells recruited with plasma creatinin levels at the
end of the first week of reperfusion underlining a direct
relationship between the intensity of inflammatory process
and pejorative graft outcome.
Oxidative stress and apoptosis are two major compo￾nents of IRI, both closely associated to the inflammatory
process [23]. We demonstrated that CS combined or not
with WI induced an overexpression of NADPH oxidase
enzyme subunits during the first week of reperfusion in
contrast to WI alone. This complex may participate in
the superoxide anion production by inflammatory cells
infiltrating the graft, or directly from the injured tissue.

at 3 months post-reperfusion. * p < 0.05 vs. control, $ p < 0.05 between ischemic groups.

This pro-oxidative milieu was accentuated by a de￾creased expression of the major antioxidant enzymes:
SODs already reported in a rodent model [24]. These re￾sults indicate that severe ischemic conditions induce an
early pro-oxidative microenvironment and that D3 is a
critical time point to evaluate the red/ox balance. Apop￾tosis is also known to be an important response to ische￾mic injury [25]. Our results indicate an early activation
of the apoptotic process few hours after ischemia. The
high level of cleaved caspase 3 staining at H3 and the re￾turn to basal values at D7 in WI group suggests an early
transitory apoptotic process. However, the high level of
injury in WI + CS group at H3 was associated with a
high staining level but limited in CS group. On the other
hand, at D7 this expression was similar in both CS
groups, highlighting the need for early evaluation of
such markers, since along with oxidative stress, this
pathway is only discriminant in the early days of reperfu￾sion. In these conditions, apoptosis markers could be
primarily detected in tubular cells as previously de￾scribed in human cadaveric kidney allograft [26]. Taken
together, these results support that ischemia condition
and duration [27] could influence the level and the local￾isation of the apoptotic process.
Our study investigates the chronological development
of early immunity in various preclinical ischemic condi￾tions. Endothelial activation, a prerequisite in the initial
recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury, is a key of
innate immunity response initiation commonly assessed
by vascular endothelium markers expression such as se￾lectin adhesion molecules. In our conditions, P-selectin
mRNA expression was increased early after reperfusion
(H3) in CS and WI + CS groups then reached control
values at D7. However, WI did not affect this expression.
Early immunity could be partially mediated by Damage
Associated Molecular Pattern molecules (DAMPs) which
bind the TLRs [16,28,29]. These DAMPs are released by
cells that have been damaged by IR and thus closely asso￾ciated to oxidative stress, apoptosis and necrosis [30,31].
TLRs constitute an integral part of the innate immune re￾sponse and play a pivotal role in IRI, though the role of
each receptor is still unclear [32]. The stimulated-TLRs
pathway induces the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, IL-8 as well as ex￾pression of cell adhesion molecules like VCAM-1 on
endothelial cells [33]. In a recent study using deficient
TLR4 mice, Pulskens et al. show that TLR4 initiates an ex￾aggerated pro-inflammatory response upon renal IRI and
subsequently controls the induction of an innate immune
response [17]. In our study, TLR2 expression followed the
level of renal injury, particularly after D3. TLR4 over￾expression was found in CS and WI + CS, but was not sig￾nificantly different between both groups. Thus, TLR4
expression appears due to cold ischemic injury while
TLR2 is a more discriminant marker of ischemic stress
level. MCP-1 was significantly overexpressed in WI + CS
from D3 supporting that the degree of injury seems to
modulate the MCP-1 response. MCP-1 recruits mono￾cytes and dendritic cells to the sites of tissue injury and in￾flammation. In addition, DAMPs are known to stimulate
IL-1β secretion from the NLRP3 (NOD-like receptors
Protein 3) inflammasome inducing pro-inflammatory cy￾tokines production and immune cells invasion [34]. As IL￾1β, IL-6 could be produced by macrophages to stimulate
Figure 4 Adaptive response affects early and chronic graft function. Invading CD3+ and ED1+ cells in kidney graft correlate with the
severity of ischemic injuries (a, c). The creatininemia after 7 days of reperfusion and fibrosis percentage evaluated at 3 months correlate with the
number of lymphocytes invading the tissue at the end of the first week of reperfusion (b, d). r² and Spearman rank are indicated.

immune response in damaged tissue leading to expand in￾flammation. Interestingly, we observed an IL1Rn mRNA
(gene encoded to Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) in￾creased expression at D3 which could be appearing in re￾sponse to IL-1β production. We reported an IL-10 mRNA
over-expression by high intensity of IRI up to one week
after reperfusion. As previously described, IL-10 could be
a protecting agent against renal IRI decreasing TNFα ex￾pression and reactive oxygen species production [35]. Our
observed IL-10 levels could be linked to autologous im￾mune response induced by CS as our results showed no
differences between CS and WI + CS. In our results, this
alarming environment, stimulated in the WI + CS condi￾tion was characterized by an increase of TLR2 and TLR4
mRNA supporting a DAMPs pathway, stimulating an
upregulation from D3 of MCP1 and macrophages
invasion.
The originality of this study was the graft follow-up dur￾ing the first three months after transplantation. In accord￾ance to the findings of the first week of reperfusion, we
observed a deleterious effect of WI when is combined
with CS. Indeed, the difference at D3 in term of renal
function in each group was also observed at 3 months. As
previously described in our DCD mimicking model [36],
associating WI + CS, we observed an inflammatory re￾sponse characterized by endothelial activation remaining
until three months after reperfusion with an increase of
MCP-1, and VCAM-1 expressions. These results were
supported by lymphocytes and monocytes recruitment
already described in this model seven days after reperfu￾sion and maintained 3 months later. As these parameters
did not reach statistical differences compared to control in
WI or CS groups, these results highlight the direct rela￾tionship between the intensity of IR and chronic outcome.
Above a certain degree of injury, specific pathological pro￾cesses are rendered irreversible and will unavoidably lead
to chronic failure.
Accordingly, we observed a level of tubular atrophy and
fibrosis directly dependent on the severity of ischemia
three months before. We underlined that WI alone also
promotes fibrosis development although the inflammatory
response was not present suggesting a stable process. As
expected, CS group exhibited a collagen expression level
between WI and WI + CS. Moreover, the development of
renal fibrosis is still ongoing in WI + CS group, as indi￾cated by profibrotic pathways activation analysis. While in
WI or CS group they appear inhibited or reduced, we
showed a trend towards increased for TGFβ and a signifi￾cant rise of its first downstream mediator pSmad3 in WI +
CS, indicate a maintain production of collagen and a
progression of renal fibrosis accentuated by MMP-2 de￾crease expression supporting a less extracellular matrix
degradation. In addition, these three parameters are not
affecting three months after reperfusion by WI or CS
conditions, conversely to BMP-7. In fact, CS group
exhibited a high expression of BMP-7 in favour to a reduc￾tion of TGFβ pathway activation and an inhibition of col￾lagen synthesis [37]. Plasminogen pathway is also involved
in extracellular matrix homeostasis and subsequent fibro￾sis development [38]. We observed an upper expression of
PAI-1 in ischemic groups which attained significant differ￾ence in WI + CS group which is associated to a down￾expression of tPA compared to WI or CS groups. In these
conditions, as BMP-7, the tPA expression is increased re￾lated to control value indicating a high extracellular
matrix degradation which could explain, in part, the
minor intensity of red Sirius staining in these groups.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the severity of ischemic injuries induced by
WI in transplantation process found in kidneys from
DCD has a crucial impact in early immune reactivity, graft
recovery and outcome, suggesting to intensify follow up in
case of DCD organs. Recently, we reported that cold pres￾ervation time in DCD conditions is an interesting thera￾peutic window giving the opportunity to treat the graft
without systemic effect especially by pulsatile perfusion,
oxygenated preservation or with pharmacological mole￾cules [39]. The complexity of the injury exposed herein
strengthens the need for adapted animal models able to
evaluate varying degrees of injury and new protocols in
clinic-like conditions. Such translational models offer the
possibility to study various aspects related to kidney pres￾ervation and to develop accurate protocols for organ man￾agement from DCD easily applicable in clinical situation.
