Abstract
Liver transplantation (LT) is a challenging surgery performed on patients with complex physiology profiles, compli￾cated by multi-system dysfunction. It represents the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease. The procedure is 
performed under general anaesthesia, and a successful procedure requires an excellent understanding of the patho￾physiology of liver failure and its implications. Despite advances in knowledge and technical skills and innovations in 
immunosuppression, the anaesthetic management for LT can be complicated and represent a real challenge. Moni￾toring devices offer crucial information for the successful management of patients. Hemodynamic instability is typi￾cal during surgery, requiring sophisticated invasive monitoring. Arterial pulse contour analysis and thermo-dilution 
techniques (PiCCO), rotational thromboelastometry (RO-TEM), transcranial doppler (TCD), trans-oesophageal echo￾cardiography (TEE) and bispectral index (BIS) have been proven to be reliable monitoring techniques playing a signifi￾cant role in decision making. Anaesthetic management is specific according to the three critical phases of surgery: 
pre-anhepatic, anhepatic and neo-hepatic phase. Surgical techniques such as total or partial clamping of the inferior 
vena cava (IVC), use of venovenous bypass (VVBP) or portocaval shunts have a significant impact on cardiovascular 
stability. Post reperfusion syndrome (PRS) is a significant event and can lead to arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.

Introduction
Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for 
end-stage liver disease regardless of its aetiology. Ever 
since the first transplant interventions in the 1960s, 
mortality rates after LT have significantly improved 
and have led to an increase in the number of successful 
procedures and improved outcomes.
Significant challenges remain for the transplant 
team as the procedure is performed on high-risk pa￾tients with impaired cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal 
and coagulation systems. Recent publications have in￾dicated that transplant candidates are older, sicker and 
with multiple associate co-morbidities and organ dys￾functions compared to those treated in the past. Ad￾equate perioperative care is essential for a prompt graft 
function which will improve organ system recovery 
and recipient’s quality of life [1].
Though there is a potential worldwide liver graft 
shortage, the expansion of the donor pool using mar￾ginal donors and increasing donor age has resulted, 
never the less, in reduced waiting list mortality [2]. A 
successful LT requires teams with a particular set of 
skills and competences, including a complete and de￾tailed understanding of the multi-organic pathophysi￾ology of liver failure and its implications and manage￾ment during the three stages of surgery.
There have been many innovations, updates and 
procedural changes in the anaesthetic management of 
patients during this time. This article gives an overview 
of the current literature regarding anaesthetic manage￾ment during liver transplantation and its singularities 
during the three stages of surgery.
Indications for liver transplanta￾tion
The indications for LT in patients with acute and 
chronic liver failure should be assessed independent of 
the aetiology and are listed in Table 1 [3].

The US and European countries have been using the 
Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for 
organ allocation since 2007. This is a grading system 
from 6 to 40 points, which depends on four laboratory 
variables: serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, the inter￾national normalised ratio (INR) and serum sodium 
and evaluates the severity of chronic liver disease for 
patients older than twelve years of age. The aetiology 
of liver disease has been shown to be inefficient in pre￾dicting patient mortality. The UK Model for End-Stage 
Liver Disease (UKELD) score is used in recipient selec￾tion and prioritisation in the UK.
Certain medical conditions defined as “standard 
MELD exceptions” are eligible for an upgrade in MELD 
points and require periodic reassessment [4].
They include: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hyper￾tension, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, primary hy￾peroxaluria, cystic fibrosis, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, 
hepatic artery thrombosis (within 14 days after LT but 
not meeting criteria for status 1A).
Another notable exception from the MELD prior￾itisation system is acute liver failure patients; they are 
UNOS status 1A or 1B, and the severity and priority for 
LT are made according to King’s College Criteria [5].

The Milan criteria is used in selecting patients with 
primary liver tumours who may benefit from LT. Pa￾tients with a single tumour of 5 cm or less, or up to 2–3 
tumours between 1 -3cms in diameter, are considered 
to qualify for LT [6].
Anaesthetic monitoring
Stages of surgery
LT is considered a complex procedure and is charac￾terised by haemodynamic instability during the three 
phases of surgery:
Pre-anhepatic phase: from skin incision to clamping 
of the inferior vena cava (IVC), portal vein and hepatic 
artery; liver is being dissected, and significant bleeding 
can occur 
Anhepatic phase: from the moment the hepatic ve￾nous inflow is being clamped up to graft reperfusion; 
the IVC is clamped causing a decrease in cardiac out￾put (CO)
Neo-hepatic phase: it begins from the moment of 
liver reperfusion; resumption of flow in the portal vein 
and IVC; complicated by post-reperfusion syndrome 
(PRS) or bleeding from vascular anastomosis (IVC, he￾patic artery or portal vein)
Patient monitoring
Anaesthetic management for liver transplant include:
Standard monitoring, according to the American So￾ciety of Anaesthesia (ASA) protocols: five lead ECG, 
pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure and tem￾perature.
Hemodynamic monitoring:
•	A central line insertion is used for central venous 
pressure (CVP) monitoring and vasopressor infu￾sion. A second central line/introducer sheath or 
large-bore peripheral cannula can be used for rapid 
blood and fluid infusion [7].
•	The introducer sheath can be used for pulmonary ar￾tery (PA) catheter placement in cases of patients with 
pulmonary hypertension (PHT) that need constant 
monitoring.
•	Invasive arterial blood pressure measurement repre￾sents the gold standard during LT; arterial lines are 
usually placed after induction. 
•	 One or two arterial lines can be inserted and this var￾ies due to protocols used in different centres. 
•	 One catheter can be inserted in the radial artery; 
radial artery pressure measurements have the dis￾advantage of underestimating aortic pressure in hy￾potensive states when high dose vasopressors are 
used and after graft reperfusion. More accurate BP 
measurements can be obtained via a catheter in the 
femoral/brachial artery. This is the reason why some 
centres decide to insert a second line in the femoral /
brachial artery [8].
CO monitoring: Some centres use pulse contour 
analysis for stroke volume variation monitoring and 
fluid guidance. These methods require periodic calibra￾tion via thermo-dilution techniques and have the ad￾vantage of calculating important parameters of preload 
[9, 10] which can guide fluid management. Insertion of 
a Swan-Ganz catheter is mandatory in recipients with 
pulmonary hypertension [11].
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is not 
used routinely during liver transplantation but can 
be an excellent diagnostic tool for potential causes of 
cardiovascular collapse, such as PHT, hypovolemia, 
myocardial depression, clot or air embolism. It can also 
quickly assess the performance of venovenous bypass, 
contractility, pericardial or pleural effusions. Recipi￾ents with recent oesophageal banding are at high risk 
of gastrointestinal bleeding during TEE insertion and 
manipulation; it is relatively contraindicated in grade 
III/IV oesophageal varices [12].
All invasive monitoring should be followed by well￾established protocols for safety reasons, in order to re￾duce the risk of hematomas. Ultrasound monitoring is 
now the gold standard accompanying catheter inser￾tion [13]. The incidence of invasive monitoring com￾plications is low, but femoral site complications, espe￾cially infection, can be severe [14].
Neurologic monitoring
Anaesthetic management and decision making can 
be guided using different devices and parameters [15].
Most LT centres use bispectral index (BIS) as a guid￾ing tool for anaesthetic depth during both total intrave￾nous anaesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational techniques. 
Studies have revealed that the use of BIS could decrease 
intraoperative awareness as it can guide titrate anaes￾thetic requirements during LT [16].
BIS use is beneficial, especially in acute liver failure 
(ALF) patients as they often complicate and present 
with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). During liv￾er transplantation, cerebral oximetry has been used to 
demonstrate impaired cerebral autoregulation, cerebral

deoxygenation during the anhepatic phase, and hyper￾oxygenation after reperfusion of the donor graft. 
Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) monitor￾ing is another important parameter in ALF patients 
and shows the balance between oxygen uptake and 
consumption. 
Neuromuscular monitoring is very important for fast 
track anaesthesia as it can diagnose residual neuromus￾cular blockade and depressed pharyngeal tonus; it has 
the great advantage of minimising perioperative com￾plications in LT patients.
Other important parameters need to be monitored 
constantly during LT. Diuresis must be checked hourly 
to ensure good renal function, especially because some 
centres may decide to clamp the vena cava. Constant 
haemoglobin, haematocrit, electrolytes, base excess 
and lactate determinations are vital during this proce￾dure as it help guide the anaesthetist in making the best 
decision for patient management. Viscoelastic testing 
has become the system of choice for guiding coagula￾tion management and tests are being made according 
to each patient’s bleeding status.
Intraoperative anaesthesia
ESLD patients are at high risk of delayed gastric emp￾tying, and rapid sequence induction (RSI) is usually 
preferred. 
Indications for RSI consist of:
•	 ascites
•	recent food intake
•	 gastroparesis
Cirrhotic patients present for LT with modified an￾aesthetic drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacody￾namics, which reduce hepatic blood flow and oxygen 
uptake. They have low albumin levels which increase 
the bioavailability of many drugs including benzodi￾azepines; they should be carefully used especially for 
preoperative anxiolysis as they have a longer half-life, 
duration of action and reduced protein binding [17].
Induction of general anaesthesia (GA):Intravenous 
induction with propofol and etomidate are the pre￾ferred short-acting intravenous anaesthetic agents for 
LT recipients
Propofol is frequently used because of its vasodilator 
effects causing a moderate reduction in hepatic blood 
flow. Etomidate causes a decrease in hepatic blood flow 
and has an increased distribution volume with an un￾predictable clinical recovery. 
Maintenance of GA: The use of a balanced technique
with inhalational anaesthetics, non-depolarising mus￾cle relaxants and opioids is recommended. 
Cirrhotic patients have reduced inhalational anaes￾thetic requirements compared to healthy subjects, and 
this requirement is reflected in the MELD score
Volatile agents decrease mean arterial pressure 
(MAP) and portal blood flow. Desflurane and sevo￾flurane have little effect on total hepatic blood flow 
and are preferred in fast track liver anaesthesia. Fast 
track anaesthesia can also be achieved with the use of 
rocuronium (if sugammadex is available), atracurium, 
remifentanil or fentanyl infusion. Fentanyl is metabo￾lised by the liver, but its elimination is not altered in 
cirrhotic patients [18].
Due to substantial haemodynamic instability that 
can suddenly occur, emergency drugs should be avail￾able during the three stages of surgery: adrenaline, 
dopamine and noradrenaline are the drugs of choice. 
Vasopressin can also be used in case of refractory hy￾potension as studies showed that ESLD patients have 
lower vasopressin levels [19].
During a LT procedure, substantial bleeding is al￾most always anticipated and commonly occurs. It is 
recommended that cell salvage devices are available for 
routine use. 
The presence of neoplasia or infection represents ab￾solute contraindications for cell salvage devices. Pro￾phylactic antibiotics should be administered before a 
skin incision is made. but this varies according to each 
centre; re-dosing is necessary if massive bleeding occurs
Some centres use octreotide in patients with portal 
hypertension in order to decrease portal pressures and 
flow during LT. Common side effects of octreotide in￾clude: increase in systemic and pulmonary vascular re￾sistance, bradycardia and increase in arterial pressures 
[20].
Intraoperative fluid management
Appropriate fluid management is essential during 
LT. Cirrhotic patients have an abnormal fluid distri￾bution and impaired response to fluid therapy. This is 
sometimes complicated by bleeding and coagulopathy. 
Considering all these issues, a thorough assessment of 
patients’ volume status should be regularly performed 
during the procedure by means of invasive haemody￾namic monitoring. 

Available online at: www.jccm.ro The Journal of Critical Care Medicine 2020;6(2) • 95
Excessive fluid therapy can have substantial adverse 
effects leading, at time, to pulmonary and graft oede￾ma, organ congestion and abnormal gas exchange.
Present studies do not offer a clear answer regard￾ing the ideal monitoring system and fluid therapy in 
LT patients.
The use of invasive haemodynamic monitoring 
helps the anaesthetist assess cardiac function and end 
diastolic volume or preload. 
The use of transpulmonary thermodilution tech￾niques offers information about fluid responsiveness 
with parameters like stroke volume variation (SVV) 
and global end-diastolic index (GEDI). An important 
preload parameter is the intrathoracic blood volume 
(ITBV) which can be used throughout the three stages 
of LT surgery, especially in the anhepatic phase when 
the IVC is clamped [21]. Studies show that CVP and 
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) are not 
accurate preload parameters [22]. Avoiding plasma 
transfusion and thus lowering the CVP in the pre-an￾hepatic phase proved toreduce red blood cell transfu￾sion significantly [23].
Adequate vasoactive substances can offer better 
hemodynamic stability and organ perfusion, mainly 
when significant blood loss occurs. Massive transfusion 
can have substantial adverse effects, and the number of 
blood products administered intraoperatively can pre￾dict patients’ readmission to ICU [24]. Goal-directed 
fluid therapy during LT is crucial as it can decrease post 
anaesthesia care unit stay (PACU) and mortality [25].
Albumin use proved efficient in reducing the total 
amount of intraoperative fluid given and reducing the 
incidence of pulmonary oedema [26]. Studies showed 
that albumin decreases mortality, reduces the inci￾dence of PRS and the use of vasopressor agents; high 
costs limit its use. Hetastarch is not recommended 
because of its side effects: it affects platelet aggregabil￾ity, decreases the concentration of coagulation factor 8 
and increases the risk of bleeding [27]. The use of col￾loids over crystalloids in liver transplant patients has 
not been supported by convincing evidence. They can 
have numerous side effects including anaphylactic re￾actions, decrease in thrombin generation, worsening 
of fibrinolysis, specific in the anhepatic phase, and in￾crease the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) [28].
Crystalloids can also be used during LT. There is no 
ideal prescription, and all have their limitations:
•	Isotonic K crystalloids can be adequate 
•	 Excessive amounts of normal saline (0.9%) should 
be avoided as this can lead to hyperchloremic aci￾dosis and a rapid increase in sodium concentra￾tionscausing acute central pontine myelinolysis.
•	 Ringer lactate (RL): the lactate in RL requires liver 
metabolism for elimination.
Balanced crystalloid solutions are efficient alter￾natives for fluid therapy as they have similar plasma 
electrolytes and osmolarity. One of the significant ad￾vantages is that balanced crystalloids contain acetate, 
which requires extrahepatic metabolism to bicarbo￾nate; some proinflammatory and potential cardiotoxic 
effects of these solutions have also been described [29].
There is no perfect recipe regarding fluid therapy 
during LT; a thorough assessment of the patient volem￾ic status and goal-directed fluid management are im￾portant measures for a successful procedure. 
Pre-anhepatic phase
This is the first phase of the surgery where liver dissec￾tion is carried out. One of the most critical complica￾tions during this phase is massive bleeding with a se￾vere impact on the patient’s volume status.
It has been shown that surgical experience leads to 
a significant decrease in bleeding risk during this first 
phase. However, exceptions can still occur in the pres￾ence of high portal hypertension and portosystemic ve￾nous shunts, previous surgeries, spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis (SBP), and redo LT. 
Some LT recipients present with portal hypertension 
and ascites; its drainage during the procedure can cause 
hypotension and hemodynamic instability. 
Fluid resuscitation is needed to avoid hypovolemia 
during the second phase when the IVC will be clamped. 
Albumin 20% is the preferred option in these patients 
and RL and K containing solutions should be avoided. 
Cell salvage devices can be used after the evacua￾tion of ascites and before biliary anastomosis. Studies 
showed that octreotide infusion could be used to re￾duce portal venous pressures, improve renal function 
and decrease total red blood cells transfused during LT 
[30].
One of the disadvantages of bleeding and inappro￾priate/excessive fluid resuscitation is dilutional coagu￾lopathy and thrombocytopenia, which can be chal￾lenging to manage. Studies show that correction of 
standard coagulation test values may be unreliable and 

 96 • The Journal of Critical Care Medicine 2020;6(2) Available online at: www.jccm.ro
inadequate for acute coagulation deficit correction, and 
viscoelastic testing is recommended for coagulation 
management during a LT procedure [31].
An advantage of viscoelastic tests is the ability to di￾agnose hyperfibrinolysis which frequently occurs dur￾ing liver transplantation, especially in the anhepatic 
phase. Fortunately, it is self-limited in a good function￾ing graft. Antifibrinolytic agents can be used when dif￾fuse bleeding occurs or when “point of care tests” indi￾cate hyperfibrinolysis [31].
Anaesthetist should pay particular attention to, and 
carry out the following during this first stage:
•	 Maintaining a low CVP can represent an options 
for reducing bleeding, though the published evi￾dence is conflicting [32,33]
•	Adequate volume loading is necessary; cirrhotic 
patients present with marked vasodilation which 
requires use of vasoactive drugs
•	Correct hypothermia and acidosis
•	 Treat hypocalcaemia
•	 Maintain K below 4mEq/L
•	 Use “ point of care devices” for transfusion guid￾ance
•	 Treat hyper fibrinolysis and then administer fi￾brinogen 24mg/kg and platelets [34]
•	 Use of recombinant activated Factor 7
•	 Veno-venous bypass in case of massive bleeding, 
hemodynamic instability, complicated surgical 
procedure, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary hy￾pertension [35]
The anaesthetic goal in this first stage of surgery is to 
optimise volume status by achieving a balance between 
fluid perfusion and vasopressors to prepare the patient 
for the clamping of the IVC in the anhepatic phase.
Anhepatic phase
It is one of the most challenging parts of the proce￾dure, as the hepatic outflow is obstructed and the IVC 
can be clamped. These will lead to cardiovascular in￾stability, with a decrease in preload, CO and arterial 
pressures. Quick diagnosis and management with vas￾oactive and inotropic drugs are required during this 
phase of surgery.
Some patients will not tolerate the substantial de￾crease in preload despite adequate measures. In such 
cases, hemodynamic collapse can be managed with a 
surgical portosystemic shunt or a portosystemic veno￾venous bypass (VVB) where these are available. Some 
ESLD patients may present with minimal cardiovascu￾lar instability due to a well-developed collateral circula￾tion [36].
During this phase of surgery, the patient is anhepat￾ic, and the total loss of liver function can have the fol￾lowing anaesthetic implications: Patients may become:
•	 acidotic
•	 hypocalcaemia due to lack of lactate and citrate 
metabolism
•	 hyperkaliaemic
Rapid diagnosis of these critical changes should be 
made and prompt measures taken to correct them.
Hyperkalaemia and acidemia can be treated with 
loop diuretics, insulin, glucose, bicarbonate and hyper￾ventilation. Worsening hyperkalaemia, unresponsive 
to any previous measures, may require intraoperative 
renal replacement therapy. Tromethamine infusion for 
K control has also been suggested in the literature [37].
Due to clamping of the IVC, fluid resuscitation in 
this phase should be carefully considered and guided 
by hemodynamic data. Excessive fluid can result in 
fluid overload during reperfusion which could lead 
to right heart failure and graft congestion. It has been 
recommended that adequate arterial pressure is main￾tained with vasopressors and inotropes and that no￾radrenaline is the vasopressor of choice during LT [38].
Despite cardiovascular instability, minimal bleeding 
is normal in the anhepatic phase. Studies have shown 
that viscoelastic tests represent the gold standard for 
diagnosis and management of coagulation problems 
(including hyperfibrinolysis) during LT. Platelets and 
coagulation factors are decreased due to loss and con￾sumption in the pre-anhepatic phase. Synthesis of co￾agulation factors and liver clearance do not exist in 
this phase. The severity of the coagulopathy developed 
correlates with the length of the anhepatic phase. Hy￾pothermia and acidosis make coagulation problems 
worse. Coagulopathy develops due to the accumulation 
of tPA and other anticoagulant factors, including hepa￾rinoid products which are generally metabolised by the 
functioning liver [39]. All these changes cause hyper￾fibrinolysis and bleeding. No aggressive correction of 
coagulation abnormalities should be made unless the 
patient is bleeding since a proper functioning graft will 
immediately metabolise these products [39].
Some centres prefer using mannitol (0.5g/kg) before 
IVC clamping in order to avoid liver blood congestion 
and intraabdominal organs oedema [40].

At this stage, the anaesthetist should optimise the 
patient for graft reperfusion by considering the follow￾ing:
•	Keep serum K levels below 4mEq/L
•	Calcium levels should be normalised
•	Inotropes should be readily available
•	There are conflicting studies regarding metabolic 
acidosis correction. It will self correct with the 
reperfusion and function of the liver. Minimis￾ing blood transfusion helps decrease K levels and 
acidosis [41].
In the anhepatic phase, corticoid therapy is fre￾quently started intraoperatively, with a bolus dose of 
methylprednisolone aceponate (MPA) of 500mg-1g. A 
common side effect is hyperglycaemia which needs to 
be monitored regularly during the procedure. Gluco￾corticoids are usually stopped after one year of treat￾ment [42].
Recipients with hepatitis B receiving hepatitis B neg￾ative graft should be infused with hepatitis B hyper im￾munoglobulin; watch out for allergic reactions.
Neo-hepatic phase
During the first five minutes after graft reperfusion, 
significant hemodynamic changes can occur including 
a sudden decrease in blood pressure, heart rate, SVR 
and CO. Liver reperfusion can result in worsening of 
PHT and right heart failure. A rapid increase in K is 
common at this stage and can lead to sinus arrest. 
In the absence of VVB, sequestered blood from the 
portal and lower body venous system suddenly returns 
to the heart. 
Also, high K preservative solutions and endog￾enous metabolites accumulated in the liver graft dur￾ing ischemia time return to the heart. The heart will 
be overloaded and these products will cause vasodila￾tion, depressed cardiac function and pulmonary va￾soconstriction [43]. The typical response of right and 
left ventricle to stress is abolished due to substances 
released from the liver in this phase of the surgery [44].
The post reperfusion syndrome (PRS) is defined as a 
30% decrease in the mean arterial pressure for at least a 
minute and which appears in the first five minutes after 
graft reperfusion [45]. It can have fatal consequences 
such as severe arrhythmias or asystole. Dyselectro￾lytemia, cold solutions used for graft preservation and 
severe vasodilation due to non-release may contribute 
to PRS. Studies also show that patients with PRS have 
an increased risk of postoperative renal dysfunction 
and fifteen days mortality prediction [46].
Pre-emptive actions before graft reperfusion can 
be adopted in order to decrease the risk of PRS such 
as intravenous calcium chloride (1-2g) to stabilise the 
cardiac membrane, use of inotropes and vasopressors 
for circulatory support and the administration of bi￾carbonate and tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane 
(THAM) to correct metabolic acidosis.
Correction of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicar￾bonate remains controversial. Aggressive treatment of 
serum K in the previous stages is vital (K below 4mEq/L). 
Cell saver usage also helps prevent an increase in K 
levels due to massive transfusion. Autologous blood 
has a low acid content and normal K+ concentration, 
relatively higher2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels and thus 
provides better cell vitality, preventing complications 
such as hyperkalaemia [47]. 
FiO2 should be maintained at 100% in order to in￾crease oxygen stores, and inhalational agents should be 
decreased to minimise vasodilatation [48].
Some studies show the effect of atropine at graft 
reperfusion before any initial sign of cardiac dysfunc￾tion (0.4-1mg). Another option for improving cardio￾vascular stability is the administration of a bolus of 
5 mg ephedrine five minutes before unclamping of the 
IVC, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 
85-100mmHg [49].
In the case of cardiac arrest, direct cardiac massage 
through a diaphragm incision should be performed. 
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is very use￾ful in these severe cases because it can offer a quick 
diagnosis of cardiac collapse. If intra-cardiac clots are 
observed, 3000-5000UI heparin bolus via a central line 
should be administered to prevent clot expansion. Pul￾monary thromboembolism can be treated with recom￾binant tissue plasminogen activators (0.5-4mg)[50].
Bleeding can also occur due to surgical problems or 
haemostatic abnormalities. Close monitoring of co￾agulation should be done via viscoelastic testing. No 
improvement in coagulation observed thirty minutes 
after graft reperfusion is associated with reduced graft 
function. Good haemostasis should be achieved before 
biliary duct anastomosis.
In this stage, the patient needs adequate volemic re￾suscitation guided by invasive monitoring devices; a 
significant decrease in vasopressors takes place.

Anaesthesia for LT is one of the most difficult and 
challenges anaesthesias. This is due to haemodynamic 
problems that can arise because of cirrhotic status and 
also because of the surgical complications during the 
three stages of surgery. Blood coagulation pattern of 
the patient has also a major contribution to patients’ 
outcome. A good understanding of the recipient’s 
pathophysiology and an adequate perioperative man￾agement are decisive for good LT outcome.
