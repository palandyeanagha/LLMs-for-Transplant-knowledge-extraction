Commercial inulin available at present is not a
homogeneous product (1). It consists of two
major fractions the proportions of which vary:
(a) a portion of relatively large molecular weight
resistant to heating in alkali; and (b) a portion
of smaller molecular weight susceptible to destruc￾tion with alkali. In addition, most samples con￾tain a small percentage of fructose, which also
yields color in the analytical methods for inulin
unless removed by treatment with yeast or hot
alkali.
Two recent reports (2, 3) indicate that the
clearance of the alkali-stable and alkali-labile frac￾tions of inulin may not be equal. Since some com￾mercial preparations of inulin (such as the one
used in this study) may contain as much as 50
per cent of the alkali-labile material, considerable
errors in estimation of glomerular filtration rate
would occur if a difference in clearance of the two
fractions exists.
The present report indicates that the clearance
of the two fractions is identical, within the limits
of error of analysis, in confirmation of the prelimi￾nary report by Cotlove (1).
METHODS
Subjects. The subjects were patients of the National
Heart Institute at the Clinical Center. One was a nor￾mal volunteer. The others had renal or endocrine dis￾eases. In most cases studies were performed in the
fasting state. The comparisons were made during clear￾ance determinations performed for other purposes.
Procedure. Before each clearance determination, the
ampoules of inulin to be used were mixed together and
a portion withdrawn for analysis.' A priming injection
and a sustaining infusion of inulin were administered in￾travenously. The plasma level of the alkali-stable frac￾tion was approximately 13 mg. per cent. After a 30 to
40-minute equilibration period, 3 to 8 urine collection pe￾riods were obtained, each of 20 to 40 minutes' duration.
1 Inulin was obtained from the Warner-Chilcott Lab￾oratories. According to the manufacturers it contains
less than 0.5 per cent fructose.
Blood for analysis was obtained in a syringe containing
heparin at the midpoint of each period.
Analytical methods. Alkali-stable inulin in plasma and
urine was determined by a modification of published
methods (4-7) as follows: protein-free plasma filtrates
were prepared according to Somogyi (8) by adding 7 ml.
of water, 1 ml. of ZnSO, reagent,2 and 1 ml. 0.75 N
NaOH (dropwise and with constant mixing) to 1 ml. of
plasma. After 20 minutes, during which the flasks were
shaken occasionally, the solutions were centrifuged and
the supernatant decanted.3 Duplicate 2 ml. aliquots of
supernatant, appropriately diluted urine and standards
were pipetted into 20 X 150 mm. tubes. Five-tenths ml.
of 4N NaOH was added from a 1 ml. Krogh-Keys
syringe-pipette. The tubes were covered with marbles
and placed in a 1000 C. bath for 20 minutes.4 After cool￾ing, 6.25 ml. of diphenylamine reagent 5 were added
from a 10 ml. Krogh-Keys syringe-pipette. Mixing was
unnecessary if the reagent was injected vigorously. The
marbles were replaced and the tubes were reheated in
the 1000 bath for 30 minutes,6 cooled, and read at 620
in,u in a Coleman Jr. spectrophotometer.
"Total" inulin was determined according to the method
of Harrison (6) as modified by Kennedy and Kleh (7).
One ml. samples of plasma or diluted urine were
treated with yeast; plasma protein was precipitated with
ZnSO42 and NaOH, diphenylamine reagent 6 was added
and the tubes were heated at 1000 C. for 30 minutes,
cooled, and read at 620 mn in the spectrophotometer. A
small percentage of yeast-labile material (< 5 per cent
of the total) was found in some of the inulin samples.
No correction was made for this. Standards for both
methods consisted of 3 dilutions of a sample of the in￾fused inulin. The recovery of inulin added to plasma at
the same 3 concentrations was determined. These con￾centrations correspond to 5, 10, and 15 mg. per cent

8 The use of filter paper was found both to absorb inu￾lin and add to the reagent blank, leading to spurious
results.
4 Since completion of these studies, it has been found
that an 8 to 10 min. period of heating with alkali is
adequate.

alkali-stable inulin in plasma in the alkali method and
10, 20, and 30 mg. per cent inulin in plasma in the yeast
method. The fraction of the infused inulin resistant to
alkali digestion was also determined in each instance.
Alkali did not interfere with the color development.
In the later experiments the results were expressed
in terms of a standard inulin solution consisting of pure
alkali-stable inulin, prepared as follows:
Preparation of alkali-stable inulin. Fifty gm. of
"Difco" inulin (approximately 85 per cent alkali-stable)
were dissolved in 50 ml. of 1 N NaOH at 1000 C. and
heated for 2 hours. The solution was cooled under the
tap and then placed in a cold room for several hours.
One-hundred ml. of distilled water were added to the
fudge-like mass and the precipitate suspended by pro￾longed stirring. Another 100 ml. of distilled water were
added and the solution centrifuged for 30 minutes. The
supernatant was decanted and the precipitate washed re￾peatedly in this manner, using progressively smaller vol￾umes of water, until no further whitening occurred. In￾ulin was reprecipitated by heating at 1000 C. and adding
just enough water for solution, filtering, cooling rapidly,
adding (with shaking) 2 volumes of acetone and filtering
by suction. Twenty grams of white material were ob￾tained. Inulin so prepared was not destroyed by yeast.
Analytical results. The relation between optical den￾sity and concentration is linear in both the yeast and the
alkali methods, throughout the useful range of the color￾imeter. The recovery of inulin added to plasma was
100.0 ± 2.3 7 per cent in 67 samples analyzed by the al￾kali method and 100.7 ± 2.0 per cent in 62 samples ana￾lyzed by the yeast method. The plasma inuloid blank

averaged 0.9 mg. per cent in the yeast method and 0.4
mg. per cent in the alkali method.
Additional observations on the alkali method. Using
the procedure described, the range of 30 to 70 per cent
transmission in the colorimeter corresponds to a range
of 6 to 16 mg. per cent alkali-stable inulin in plasma.
Analysis of a solution containing 500 mg. per cent glu￾cose resulted in color equivalent to 0.3 mg. per cent al￾kali-stable inulin.8 Autooxidation of inulin was com￾plete as shown by the fact that neither prolongation of
the heating period, substitution of 7N for 4N alkali, nor
continuous aeration of the tubes during heating with
alkali altered the results.
RESULTS
Nine subjects were studied on 17 occasions
with varying numbers of periods in each study, as
shown in Table I. In addition, repeated analyses
were performed on the samples from two of the
studies. The original data from two representa￾tive experiments are shown in Table II together
with the ratios of the clearance of alkali-stable
(Ca) to "total" inulin as determined after yeasting
(Cy). The ratios obtained from repeated analyses
of the samples from two experiments are shown
in Table III.

of about 1600: 1 is 5 to 10 times greater than the ratio

The mean of all the observed ratios of alkali￾stable inulin clearance to "total" inulin clearance
is 1.003, with a standard error of 0.011.
Several components of error can be discerned
in these data. The standard deviation of the ob￾served ratios obtained within each study is ap￾proximately 0.04. Variability of similar magni￾tude is found between the ratios from repeated
analyses of the samples from a single study
(Table III). The variability from subject to
subject and from study to study within a single
subject ("Dot") is only slightly greater. Con￾sidering the 17 stud'ies in all, the standard devia￾tion of a single ratio is 0.05. The variance of the
mean was calculated as a suitable combination of
the variance from study to study and the variance
within a single study." We may conclude that
9 Note on Computation of the Variance of the Mean.
Computation of the variance of the mean was compli￾cated by the fact that different numbers of periods were
used in different studies and that the individuals had
different numbers of studies. Thus, to assess the varia￾bility of the mean it was assumed that a given ratio was
subject to a variance o3, attribuatable to study-to-study
variation and also to a variance a*2, attributable to tech￾nical error and period-to-period variability. This then
implies that the mean for a given study has a variance
V2 0,02,where n. is the number of periods in the study.
From this point of view, the mean as computed (a simple
17
nx
average) is equivalent to Z; '-~ where ni is the number
i., n
of periods in the "i"lth study, is the average ratio for the
17
"i"th study and n = Z; ni. From the above one can
17
show that the variance of 2 is given by O
`6'
n n1 n
The component o,.2 was estimated by the variance within
studies averaged over all studies. To estimate a' the sum
the average value of the ratio is between 0.983
and 1.023 at the 95 per cent level of confidence.
Since the inulin used was approximately one
half alkali-stable and one half alkali-labile it fol￾lows that the clearance of alkali-stable inulin is on
the average equal to that of alkali-labile inulin
within approximately 4 per cent, at the 95 per
cent level of confidence.
In view of the equality of the clearances of the
two major fractions of inulin, it is of little impor￾tance whether the inulin used for measurement of
filtration rate contains a large or small proportion
of alkali-stable material. However, the analysis
of inulin by means of the diphenylamine reaction
aftei alkali treatment has several advantages over
other methods: (a) The plasma inuloid blank is
low; (b) the method is almost completely insensi￾tive to glucose; and (c) low concentrations of mnu￾lin may be determined accurately.
Since alkali-labile inulin is destroyed in this
analytical method, it is advantageous to employ
inulin containing as much alkali-stable material

as previously defined. One can show that this sum of
squares estimates (n w2 + 16 a.2. Consequently,
this latter expression with our estimated value of Q-. sub￾stituted was equated to the sum of squares. This equation
was then solved for A. The variance of ik was estimfated

It should be remarked that taking the individual as a
unit, it was found that the variance among individuals
was of order comparable to the variance among studies.
A variance of the mean computed on this basis was also
comparable to the estimate obtained using studies as a unit.

THE RENAL CLEARANCE OF ALKALI-STABLE INULIN
as possible. The method of preparation described
above is simpler than that described by Weil (9)
and permits larger yields of pure alkali-stable ma￾terial. However, inulin so prepared has only been
used in animals in this laboratory. The present
data do not establish that inulin purified after
alkali treatment has the same clearance as the
alkali-stable fraction of inulin prepared without
alkali treatment.
SUMMARY
Improved methods are presented for the deter￾mination of alkali-stable inulin in plasma and urine
and for the preparation of alkali-stable inulin.
The renal clearance of the fraction of commercial
inulin not destroyed by alkali is equal to the re￾nal clearance of the fraction of inulin destroyed,
within analytical error.
