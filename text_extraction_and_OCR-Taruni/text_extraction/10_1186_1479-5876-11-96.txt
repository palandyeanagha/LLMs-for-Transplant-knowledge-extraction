Abstract
Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent non-hematopoietic progenitor cells possessing an
immune-regulatory function, with suppression of proliferation of activated lymphocytes. In this study, adult living
donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) recipients were given MSCs derived from the donor bone marrow to evaluate
the safety and the feasibility of immunological changes related to the intra-osseous injection of MSC into the bone
marrow.
Methods: MSCs were derived from negative HLA cross-match donors. Donor bone marrow was harvested 5 weeks
prior to KT. At the time of transplantation, 1 x 106 cell/kg of donor MSC was directly injected into the bone marrow
of the recipient’s right iliac bone. Patients’ clinical outcomes, presence of mixed chimerism by short tandem repeat
polymerase chain reaction, analysis of plasma FoxP3 mRNA and cytokine level, and mixed lymphocyte reaction
(MLR) were performed.
Results: Seven patients enrolled in this study and received donor MSC injections simultaneously with LDKT. The
median age of recipients was 36 years (32 ~ 48). The number of HLA mismatches was 3 or less in 5 and more than
3 in 2. No local complications or adverse events such as hypersensitivity occurred during or after the injection of
donor MSC. There was no graft failure, but the biopsy-proven acute rejections were observed in 3 recipients during
the follow-up period controlled well with steroid pulse therapy (SPT). The last serum creatinine was a median of
1.23 mg/dL (0.83 ~ 2.07). Mixed chimerism was not detected in the peripheral blood of the recipients at 1 and
8 week of post-transplantation. Donor-specific lymphocyte or T cell proliferation and Treg priming responses were
observed in some patients. Plasma level of IL-10, a known mediator of MSC-induced immune suppression,
increased in the patients with Treg induction.
Conclusion: Donor MSC injection into the iliac bone at the time of KT was feasible and safe. A possible correlation
was observed between the induction of inhibitory immune responses and the clinical outcome in the MSC-kidney
transplanted patients. Further research will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of MSC injection for the induction
of mixed chimerism and subsequent immune tolerance in KT.

Background
Although kidney transplantation (KT) is a widely accepted
and effective treatment option for patients with end stage
renal disease, the need for life-long immunosuppression
puts the patient at constant risk. The risk of opportunistic
infections, drug toxicity, and malignancies is increased in
these patients [1]. Moreover, even with immunosuppres￾sion not all patients can evade the occurrence of acute
and chronic rejection. Over several decades many
immunosuppressive agents and regimens have been intro￾duced and the incidence of acute rejection in the early
period after the transplantation has decreased. However
most immune suppressive regimens have limitations in
long-term prevention of progressive chronic allograft
nephropathy after the transplantation, ultimately leading
to graft failure [1-3].
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent non￾hematopoietic progenitors found in the bone marrow,
cord blood, heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue.
MSCs differentiate in vitro and in vivo into tissues of
mesenchymal origin [4-6]. MSCs provide support for the
growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor
cells in bone marrow micro-environments. MSCs also
have immune regulatory effect by suppressing activated
lymphocytes proliferation and DC function [7-9].
The immune regulatory function of MSCs has been
studied in the field of hematopoietic stem cell trans￾plantation primarily for the treatment of severe,
steroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease [10-12]. Neither
acute nor long-term adverse events have been reported
after infusion of MSCs.
There is very recent research on the immune-regulatory
role of MSCs in solid-organ transplantation [13,14]. Tan
and others [14] published randomized controlled trial
results with autologous MSC in kidney transplants. After
the living-related donor kidney transplantation, patients
were treated with conventional immune suppression
regimen (steroids, mycophenolate, mofetil, and either
cyclosporine or tacrolimus) with autologous MSCs or
anti-IL2 receptor antibody. The authors found a beneficial
effect of MSCs over anti-IL2 receptor antibody induction
therapy, resulting in lower incidence of acute rejection
and opportunistic infection.
With a protocol differing considerably from Tan’s, in
the present study the effect of donor-derived MSCs on
the recipients of living donor KT (LDKT) was observed.
The most significant difference of present study from Tans
was the route and the timing of MSC administration. MSC
introduced into the bone marrow of iliac bone near the
kidney graft at the time of transplantation. Simultaneous
intra-osseous injection of MSC with kidney transplantation
could reduce the patient’s discomfort with invasive way of
cell administration. In this study, the feasibility, tolerability
and the possibility of regulatory immune induction with
intra-osseous injection of donor MSC in LDKT was
observed.The significance of MSCs on the reduction
of conventional immune-suppression regimen with
induction of transplanted organ-specific immune-tolerance
will be discussed.
Materials and methods
Patients’ characteristics and criteria
Seven patients were enrolled in this study during August
through November in 2007. The clinical protocol of this
study has been approved by Institutional Review Board of
Samsung Medical Center (SMC 2006-06-031-001) and
Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) (KFDA￾BM-350, 20070125). Patients between age 20 and 65 years
receiving living donor KT for the first time were eligible for
the study. Patients were excluded if they showed positive
in HLA-cross-match, PRA > 30%, and positive serologic
markers for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. Patients were
informed of the investigative nature of this study, and writ￾ten consent in accordance with institutional regulations
was obtained prior to study entry. Median age was 36 years
(range 32–48) and the characteristics of the patients
enrolled in the study are detailed in Table 1.
MSC culture and infusion
All the manufacturing and product testing procedures for
the generation of clinical-grade MSCs were performed
under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions
(Pharmicell Co Ltd, Seongnam, South Korea) according to
the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA)
approved-protocols (KFDA-BM-350, 20070125). MSCs
were derived from negative HLA-cross-match donors.
Five weeks prior to the transplantation, approximately
50 mL of bone marrow was obtained from the posterior

superior iliac crest of donor. Mononuclear cells were
separated from the bone marrow by density gradient
centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, 1.077 g/L, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco modified Eagle
medium-low glucose (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, NY)
containing 10% fatal bovine serum and 100 U/mL penicil￾lin/100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), and plated at a dens￾ity of 1.0-1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in 75 cm2 or 175 cm2 flasks.
Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmos￾phere containing 5% CO2. After 5–7 days, non-adherent
cells were removed by replacing the medium and the
adherent cells were cultured another 2–3 days. After
reaching 70-80% confluency, the adherent cells were
detached with Trypsin containing EDTA (Gibco) and re￾plated at a density of 4–5 × 103 cells/cm2 in 175 cm2 flasks.
The cells were serially sub-cultured up to passage five for
infusion. On the day of injection, MSCs were harvested
using Trypsin, washed twice with PBS and once with
saline solution, and re-suspended to a final concentra￾tion of 5.0 × 106 cells/ mL in saline solution. Criteria
for release of MSCs for clinical use included absence of
microbial contamination (bacteria, fungus, virus and
mycoplasma) and viability greater than 80% when assessed
using a trypan blue exclusion assay. Also clinical grade
MSCs were characterized by expression of CD73 and
CD105 (more than 90%) and absence of CD14, CD34, and
CD45 (less than 3%) (data not shown). Infusion of MSCs
(1 × 106 cell/kg) directly into the bone marrow of the reci￾pient’s iliac bone was done simultaneously with transplan￾tation of the kidney. Changes in the patient’s vital signs or
appearance of the skin, signs of anaphylaxis were continu￾ously monitored during and after the injection of MSCs.
Immune suppression
Patients with MSC-kidney transplants were treated with
conventional immune-suppression regimen. Starting from
the day of KT, patients were given anti-thymocyte globulin
for induction, for a total of 8–10 days (1.5 mg/kg daily).
The maintenance immune-suppression regimen consisted
of a calcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
and steroids. Dosage was decreased at the clinician’s dis￾cretion when such adverse events as leukopenia or se￾vere diarrhea occurred.
Clinical evaluation
Patients were monitored throughout the study by clin￾ical examination and toxicity assessment. Hematology,
blood chemistry, urinalysis, immune-suppressive drug
levels (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), CMV antigenemia,
polyoma and parvovirus PCR tests were done according
to protocol schedule. Ultrasonography-guided percutan￾eous core needle biopsy of the transplanted kidney was
done at 12 months post-transplant.
Diagnosis and treatment of acute cellular rejection (ACR)
Upon periodic assessment of serum creatinine level, a
20% or higher increase raised clinical suspicion of ACR.
Diagnosis of ACR was done via percutaneous needle bi￾opsy of the transplanted kidney, with pathologic evalu￾ation according to the Banff criteria. Once a diagnosis of
ACR was made, the patient was put on steroid pulse
therapy (SPT, solumedrol 500 mg/day for 3 days), then
tapering back to the dose prior to therapy. If the rejec￾tion episode was steroid-resistant, second-line agents
such as thymoglobulin were used.
Chimerism analysis
Short tandem repeat polymerase chain reaction
(STR-PCR) was used to identify the presence of
mixed chimerism in the recipient’s peripheral blood
on day 7, 60, and 180 days following transplantation.
FoxP3 Quantitation using real time PCR
Experiment performed by following the manufacturer
providing procedures. Patients urine was collected on
day 0, before the transplantation and various time points
(days 7, 30, 90, 180 and 365) after the transplantation.
Total RNA was extracted from recipient urine pellets by
RNeasy minikit (Qiagne, Chatsworth, CA) and 1 μg was
reverse-transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). PCR reaction mixtures contained univer￾sal mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA),
cDNA, gene-specific primers and probes. Primers were
purchased from Sigma Genosys (Woodlands, TX). 18S
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) levels were analyzed as house￾keeping gene expression for relative quantification. The
relative expression of FoxP3 to 18S rRNA was expressed
as ΔCt values as discussed by Livak et al. [15].
Mixed lymphocyte reaction
A heparinized blood sample was collected from the re￾cipient before (day-35) and after (day +30) the LDKT.
Separated recipient lymphocytes were seeded triplicates
in 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells/100 μl/well) with irra￾diated donor lymphocytes (1 × 105 cells/100 μl/well)
with or without ConA (1 μg/ml final concentration)
for the culture at 37°C, in humidified and 5% CO2-
conditioned air for 4 days. Cultures were loaded with
1 μCi 3
H-thymidine/well (Perkin-Elmer Inc., MA,
USA) during the last 18 h. Cells were harvested on
the glass micro-fiber filter using a PhDW cell harvester
(Cambridge Technology Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). The
proliferative response was determined by 3
H-thymidine
incorporation using a liquid scintillation counter
(Beckman LS 6500; Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton,
CA, USA).

Measurement of cytokine level
Alteration in blood circulating concentrations of IL-10,
IL-6, and IFN-γ was measured by ELISA. Plasma was
obtained from the patient’s peripheral blood before, and
various time points (35 days before and 4, 7, 30, 90, 180 days
after the transplantation) and stored at −70°C until the
ELISA was performed using commercial kit from OptEIA™
(e-bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
For analysis of the immune response, values before and
after transplantation in the patients were used and com￾pared by Student’s t-test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Clinical outcome
Seven patients received donor MSC injection simultan￾eously with LDKT (intra-osseous injection). No adverse
events like hypersensitivity occurred during or after the
injection of donor MSC. Also there were no local compli￾cations related to the intra-osseous injection of donor
MSC into the right iliac bone of the kidney recipient.
In the MSC-treated group, acute rejection was observed
during the 12 month follow-up period in three patients
(Table 2). Acute antibody-mediated rejection occurred at
day 9 after the transplantation in patient 2 which was
treated by IVIG and plasmapheresis. In Patient 7, acute cel￾lular rejection was observed at 43 days and 613 days of
post-transplantation, controlled well with steroid pulse
therapy (SPT). Another case of acute cellular rejection was
detected on the protocol biopsy at 12 months after the
transplantation in patient 4 which caused of SPT. Two

the methods in the Materials & Methods section, Foxp3 mRNA level
in the MSC-kidney transplantation patients was measured. Patients’
urine was collected from day 0 and days 7, 30, 90, 180 and 365 after the
transplantation. Foxp3 mRNA level was compared to baseline level (= 1).

cases of borderline change observed in the patients 1 and 6
were not associated with clinical signs of rejection and not
require any additional treatment (Table 2). The last serum
creatinine of the 7 recipients was a median of 1.23 mg/dL
(0.83 ~ 2.07) and no graft failure was found (data not
shown). Characteristics and clinical rejection phenomenon
of four patients in non-MSC control group were similar to
MSC-treated group (Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2)
Chimerism induction
Chimerism analysis was done on day 7, 2 months and 6 -
months post-transplantation. Mixed chimerism was not
detected in the peripheral blood of the patients at any
time point. (Data not shown.)
FoxP3 mRNA levels
Quantitative real time PCR was performed and analyzed
for FoxP3 mRNA expression to estimate the induction
of regulatory T cells. In the MSC treated patients 1 and 2,
long-lasting induction of FoxP3 level was observed
(Figure 1). Foxp3 mRNA level in the rest of the MSC
group or non-MSC group patients was not significantly al￾tered from the baseline measured with pre-transplantation
sample obtained on day 0 (Figure 1 & Additional file 2:
Figure S1). Overall changes at each time point were com￾pared between non-MSC and MSC group (Additional file 3:
Figure S2). Different from non-MSC control group,
tendency of continuous increase of FoxP3 mRNA level was
observed in MSC-treated.
Donor-specific lymphocyte proliferation
Donor-specific proliferative response of recipient’s lympho￾cytes before (d −35) and after (d +30) the transplantation
with MSC infusion was analyzed by MLR. Compared to
the pre-transplantation, donor-specific lymphocyte prolif￾eration was significantly inhibited in the patient 5 and 7
(Figure 2). On the contrary, in patient 1 and 4, increased
lymphocyte proliferative activity was observed (Figure 2).
Alteration of T cell proliferation induced by ConA, a T cell
mitogen, was observed with similar pattern to the total
lymphocyte proliferation (Figure 3). Unfortunately, for the
ConA induced T cell proliferation, baseline data of the pa￾tient 3 and post-transplantation data of the patient 6 could
not be obtained due to the lack of sample (Figure 3). The
lymphocyte or T cell proliferative phenomenon was not
correlated with inhibitory cytokine (IL-10) secretion
or the induction of Treg presented by FoxP3 mRNA
level (Table 3).
Cytokine secretion
Cytokine secretion into the blood was analyzed. Plasma
level of IL-10, an immune inhibitory cytokine was

significantly increased in the patient 1 at day 7 (0 vs
113.81 pg/ml for the pre vs post transplantation, respec￾tively). In the patient 2, significant induction of IL-10 level
was observed at day 30 after the transplantation (0 vs
299.91 pg/ml for the pre vs post transplantation, respectively)
(Figure 4). Significant induction of IL-6 secretion at day 7
post-transplantation in patient 1 or 5 (0 vs 106.77 pg/ml
or 42.89 pg/ml for patient 1 or 5, respectively) did not
correlated with other immunological or clinical parame￾ters (Figure 5). In the patient 7, early onset of IFN-γ se￾cretion at day 4 (92.01 pg/ml) was observed (Figure 6).
In the patients other than above mentioned, no signifi￾cant alteration of cytokine level was observed.
Discussion
MSCs exert immune-regulatory effects in vitro and
in vivo, and this effect has lead to research involving
MSCs in solid organ transplant tolerance induction models
[7,16-18]. In this pilot clinical trial, feasibility along with
the possibility of immune tolerance induction by intra￾osseous injection of MSC in LDKT was observed. The
intra-osseous route of MSC infusion was tried with expect￾ation of better seeding efficiency of injected MSCs [19]. In
our clinic, MSC injection into the recipient’s iliac bone at
the time of kidney transplantation was safe and did not
result in any sign of adverse effects. At the 12 month after
the transplantation, in all seven MSC treated patients,
engraftment failure had not occurred with the two
cases of ACR which controlled well with SPT
(Table 2). No differences in the clinical responses were
observed between the non-MSC control and MSC-treated
group (Additional file 1: Table S2).
Induction of inhibitory immune function was studied
which may contribute to the reduction of the conventional
immune-suppression after transplantation. The role of
Treg in the transplantation-immunology has been
reported and MSC are known to prime the Treg to induce
the immune-suppressive effect [9,20]. The FoxP3 mRNA

transplantation. Plasma was separated and stored at −70°C until the

was measured in the patients before and various time after
the MSC-kidney transplantation (Figure 1). Although
statistical significance was not found, gradual increases of
FoxP3 mRNA representing Treg was observed in the
MSC group but not in the non-MSC control group
(Additional file 3: Figure S2). Data suggested the possible
role of injected MSC for inducing regulatory immunity in
LDKT patients by one time intra-osseous injection with
kidney transplantation simultaneously. With this data one
could assume that one time injection of MSC may not
enough to induce the clinically detectable responses.
Donor-specific lymphocyte proliferation analysed by MLR
and mitogen-induced T cell proliferation were increased
in patients 1 and 4. Among these two patients, increased
regulatory immune responses (Treg, IL-10 and IL-6 secre￾tion) were observed only in patient 1 (Table 3). In the
patient 4, but not in the patient 1, acute cellular rejection
was occurred. On the other hand, significant reduction of
donor-specific lymphocyte and mitogen-induced T cell
proliferation were occured in patients 5 and 7 (Table 3).
Interestingly, in those two patients, increased IFN-γ
secretion was observed (Table 3). Originally, IFN-γ
stimulates the effector lymphocytes rather than in￾hibits. However, the role of IFN-γ was also observed
in the MSC and immunosuppressive drug treated
murine heart transplantation group [20]. The authors
[20] explain the immunosuppressant-mediated differ￾ential secretion of IFN-γ influenced the immunosup￾pressive effect of MSC. In this study, acute cellular
rejection was observed in the patient 7 with signifi￾cant induction of IFN-γ secretion at early time point
(4 days after the transplantation).
Among the mechanisms of MSC-induced immune￾suppression including the inhibition of effector T cell
proliferation, regulatory T cell induction and immune￾inhibitory cytokines like IL-10, TGF-b [8,9,21-23]. Our
findings may contribute to reveal the possible relation￾ship between the clinical outcomes (transplant rejection)
and the inhibitory immune responses in MSC-kidney
transplant patients. However, to insure the findings, it
may necessary to compare the data from non-MSC
control group. More cases should be analyzed to conclude
for the role of MSC in immune regulation to
transplanted organ. Further clinical study is planned
to solve these problems.
