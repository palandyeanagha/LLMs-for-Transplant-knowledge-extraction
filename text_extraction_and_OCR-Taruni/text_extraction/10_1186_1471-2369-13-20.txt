Abstract
Background: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has emerged as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and
mortality throughout all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), independent from established risk factors and
markers of mineral homeostasis. The relation of FGF23 with other renal and non-renal cardiovascular risk factors is
not well established.
Methods: Using stored samples, plasma FGF23 was determined in 604 patients with moderate to severe kidney
disease that participated in the MASTERPLAN study (ISRCTN73187232). The association of FGF23 with demographic
and clinical parameters was evaluated using multivariable regression models.
Results: Mean age in the study population was 60 years and eGFR was 37 (± 14) ml/min/1.73 m2
. Median proteinuria
was 0.3 g/24 hours [IQR 0.1-0.9]. FGF23 level was 116 RU/ml [67-203] median and IQR. Using multivariable analysis the
natural logarithm of FGF23 was positively associated with history of cardiovascular disease (B = 0.224 RU/ml; p = 0.002),
presence of diabetes (B = 0.159 RU/ml; p = 0.035), smoking (B = 0.313 RU/ml; p < 0.001), phosphate level (B = 0.297
per mmol/l; p = 0.0024), lnPTH (B = 0.244 per pmol/l; p < 0.001) and proteinuria (B = 0.064 per gram/24 hrs; p = 0.002)
and negatively associated with eGFR (B = -0.022 per ml/min/1.73 m2
; p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that in patients with CKD, FGF23 is related to proteinuria and smoking. We
confirm the relation between FGF23 and other cardiovascular risk factors.

Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-established risk
factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality [1]. The
added risk of CKD is both graded, depending on stage of
disease, as well as independent from traditional cardiovas￾cular risk factors. Many studies, both experimental and
epidemiological, have tried to define the components typi￾cal for CKD that carry this added risk. Proteinuria [2],
malnutrition, deranged homeostasis of calcium and phos￾phate, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, and hyperparathyr￾oidism have all been implicated to be involved. Recently,
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was identified as a
novel risk factor not only in patients with end stage kidney
disease [3] and advanced stages of CKD [4,5], but also in
patients in the early stages of CKD and in the general
population [6]. Since FGF23 has an important role in the
regulation of mineral balance and vitamin D metabolism,
it is intriguing that its contribution to the increased risk
was independent from calcium, phosphate and vitamin D.
These observations supported the hypothesis that FGF23
may exert biological and possibly pathological effects that
are not mediated through calcium, phosphate or vitamin
D. Theoretically FGF23 could have direct toxic effects or
influence non-mineral cardiovascular risk factors. Indeed
it was suggested that FGF23 influenced vascular function
in humans [7] and was associated with heart function and
atherosclerosis [8]. Most recently, strong evidence

suggested a direct role for FGF23 as an inducer of left ven￾tricular hypertrophy in a mouse model [9].
In the current study we investigated the association of
FGF23 with established cardiovascular risk factors, and
with additional specific renal risk factors for cardiovascular
disease in a large well-described cohort of patients with
moderate to severe CKD. The mutual relationship
between FGF23 and these established risk factors could
provide important clues for future therapy, aiming at redu￾cing cardiovascular risk.
Methods
Patients
For the current study patients from the MASTERPLAN
study were used [10]. The MASTERPLAN study was
centrally approved by the medical ethical committee of
UMCU (METC, University medical center Utrecht), and
locally by all participating centers. Criteria for patient
eligibility and methods of data collection of MASTER￾PLAN have been described previously. In short, MAS￾TERPLAN is a randomized controlled clinical trial
(ISRCTN73187232), performed in nine Dutch hospitals.
788 patients with CKD (eGFR 20-70 ml/min/1.73 m2)
were randomized to either receive usual care by the
nephrologist or intensified treatment with added nurse
practitioner support. All participants gave written
informed consent. The primary end point is a composite
of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke and
cardiovascular mortality. Inclusion started in 2004 and
ended in December 2005.
For the current analysis we retrieved blood samples
collected at baseline by the patients that participated in
the MASTERPLAN study. We excluded patients who
had received a kidney transplant (n = 184).
Data collection
Baseline measurements included a questionnaire recording
smoking behavior, physical activity and medication use.
Physical examination consisted of measurement of height,
weight and blood pressure. Blood was drawn and a 24-
hour urine sample was collected. Blood and urine samples
were analyzed by the laboratory of the local center. Medi￾cal history was obtained from the medical records. History
of CV disease was defined as a history of myocardial
infarction, ischemic stroke or vascular intervention. Dia￾betes mellitus was defined as the use of glucose lowering
drugs or a fasting glucose > 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l).
FGF23 and vitamin D measurements
EDTA-plasma has been stored at -80°C until use. In these
samples c-terminal FGF23 was determined in duplicate
using a sandwich ELISA (Immutopics, San Clemente CA)
with an intra-assay and interassay coefficient of variation
of < 5% and < 16% respectively [11]. Glomerular filtration
rate was estimated (eGFR) with the four-point MDRD
formula [12]. Proteinuria was determined in 24-hour
urine collections.
In selected samples that were used for the FGF23 assay,
both 25vitD and 1,25vitD were determined using a RIA
(Diasorin, Stillwater, MN and IDS, Tyne and Wear, United
Kingdom, respectively). Intra-assay and interassay coeffi￾cient of variation were < 7% and < 10% for D25 and < 9%
and < 11% for 1,25D respectively.
Statistical analysis
Using multivariable analysis the relation of FGF23 with
classical risk factors for cardiovascular disease was studied
(model 1, sex, age, blood pressure, presence of diabetes,
prior cardiovascular disease, baseline body mass index
(BMI) and total cholesterol levels). Next, in the fully
adjusted model, the so-called “renal risk factors” were
added to the model, and the use of active vitamin D
(model 2: model 1 plus calcium, phosphate, PTH, eGFR,
proteinuria, and use of active vitamin D). To study a possi￾ble graded relation between proteinuria and FGF23, all
patients were divided, according to the degree of protei￾nuria: 1) no proteinuria; 2) proteinuria < 0.5 gram/24
hours; 3) proteinuria between 0.5 and 2.0 gram/24 hours
and 4) proteinuria > 2 gram/24 hours. For skewed data
(like FGF23) log-transformation was performed. As we
found during analysis an association between proteinuria
and FGF23, we subsequently determined serum level of
25vitD and 1,25vitD in all patients with proteinuria > 2
gram/24 hours (n = 63) and in a random sample of equal
size of patients with proteinuria < 2 gram/24 hours, to
study the possible confounding effects of vitamin D levels
on this relation. The threshold of 2 gram/24 hours was
arbitrarily chosen to have a sufficient number of patients
above this level. In this subgroup multivariable analysis
was performed with FGF23 as dependent variable, and
levels of vitamin D were added to the fully adjusted model
2. A dichotomous variable was subsequently used (pre￾sence or absence of proteinuria above 2 grams/24 hours)
to account for the categorical effect of high-proteinuria on
FGF23 levels.
Results
Patients
For 604 patients at baseline a plasma sample was available
for determination of FGF23, and all these patients were
included. Mean age was 60.2 (sd 12.5) years, 69% was male
and mean eGFR was 37 (sd 14) ml/min/1.73 m2
. All other
baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.

p = 0.011), history of cardiovascular disease (b = 0.1; p =
0.018) and smoking (b = 0.136; p = 0.001) were posi￾tively associated with FGF23, while male sex was inver￾sely associated with FGF23 (b = 0.89; p = 0.032). The
relationship between smoking and FGF23 is shown in
Figure 1.
Fibroblast growth factor 23 in the fully adjusted model
(model 2)
In this fully adjusted model, history of cardiovascular dis￾ease (b = 0.113; p = 0.002), presence of diabetes (b =
0.075; p = 0.035), smoking (b = 0.148; p < 0.001), phos￾phate level (b = 0.082; p = 0.024), PTH (b = 0.196; p <
0.001) and proteinuria (b = 0.113; p = 0.002) were posi￾tively associated with FGF23, while eGFR had an inverse
association with FGF23 (b = -0.34; p < 0.001). After cate￾gorizing the level of proteinuria, a graded relationship
between amount of proteinuria and adjusted level of
FGF23 was revealed (Figure 2). All other factors had no
significant association with FGF23 (Table 3).
Role of vitamin D status on the relationship between
proteinuria and fibroblast growth factor 23
Since the relation between proteinuria, FGF23 and eGFR
may be modulated by vitamin D status, levels of both
25vitD and 1,25vitD were determined in patients with pro￾teinuria > 2 gr/24 hours (n = 63) and a random sample of
equal size of those with proteinuria < 2 gr/24 hours. Levels
of 25vitD were 51 (± 23) and 67 (± 24) nmol/l (non-signif￾icant) and levels of 1,25vitD were 44 (± 26) and 53 (± 25)

hours and patients with proteinuria < 2 gr/24 hours
respectively. Details of these individuals are shown in
Table 4.
In this subpopulation, levels of either 25D or 1,25D had
no relation with FGF23 levels (p-values were 0.71 and 0.64
respectively). Phosphate level and smoking were positively
associated, and eGFR negatively associated with FGF23 in
this sub analysis. The magnitudes of the associations in
this substudy were similar as in the entire cohort. In addi￾tion, the use of active vitamin D, as was assessed in the
full data set and shown in Table 3, had no significant asso￾ciation with the level of FGF23.
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that in patients with CKD FGF23
is significantly associated with smoking and proteinuria
(Figures 1 & 2). This association was strong and persisted
after correcting for other well known cardiovascular and
renal risk factors. In the fully adjusted model (Table 3)
both smoking and proteinuria had a relatively high impact
on FGF23 levels that was exceeded by eGFR and PTH
only. Our data confirm the established relationship
between FGF23 on the one hand and phosphate level,
eGFR and PTH on the other [13]. This relationship possi￾bly has a biological basis as FGF23 is physiologically regu￾lated by phosphate levels [14], phosphate loading [15] and
PTH [16].
Our observation of the association between smoking and
FGF23 is novel. Possible explanations for this association
are an influence of smoking on FGF23 production, an
influence of smoking on FGF23 sensitivity or mere con￾founding by other factors that directly influence FGF23
levels. Smoking may increase FGF23 levels by affecting the
metabolism of bone, the primary source of FGF23. Indeed,
several studies have observed an association of smoking
with osteoporosis [17,18]. However, there are no experi￾mental data to support the assumption that smoking
increases FGF23 production. Furthermore, if smoking
directly increases FGF23 levels, we would have expected
lower phosphate levels in smokers, which were not
observed. Therefore, we consider it more likely that smok￾ing reduces FGF23 sensitivity, thus necessitating an
increased production to maintain phosphate excretion.

The FGF23 receptor consists of heterodimerized FGFR1
and klotho, and is primarily located in the parathyroid and
distal tubular cells in the kidney [19]. The expression of
klotho is downregulated by oxidative stress [20], leading to
dismantling of a functional FGF23-receptor. For this rea￾son it is possible that smoking, via increased oxidant
stress, decreases the number of functional FGF23 recep￾tors in the kidney [21]. We cannot exclude the possibility
that the association between FGF23 and smoking resulted
from confounding by factors such as other life style differ￾ences between smokers and non-smokers. In contrast to
others [22] we did not find a relation between body mass
index and FGF23, in the full-adjusted model. The popula￾tion studied by Marsell however was older, had better esti￾mated GFR, and lower levels of FGF23. The putative
relative contribution of BMI on FGF23 levels in the MAS￾TERPLAN cohort may be overwhelmed by other factors,
shown in Table 3. The relation we found between smoking
and levels of FGF23 is in line with a recent study that
addressed the predictive value of FGF23 on death and pro￾gression to end stage kidney disease [23]. In that study, the
proportion of smokers increased in the higher quartiles of
FGF23, however, the quantitative effect of smoking on
FGF23 was not assessed. Correcting for several factors
including smoking did not mitigate the strength of the
association between FGF23 and the risk of death. However
this does not imply that smoking cannot increase levels of
FGF23. In another recent study in the general population,
the percentage smokers did not differ between tertiles
according to levels of FGF23 [24]. Whether higher FGF23
levels exist within individual tertiles among smokers, as
compared with non-smokers, was not assessed.
The second major finding in our study is the graded rela￾tionship of FGF23 with proteinuria (Figure 2). This associa￾tion can be explained in several ways. First it is possible
that FGF23 has a direct effect on the glomerular filtration
barrier, possibly through a direct effect on glomerular
endothelial function [7] or glomerular hemodynamics.
However, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is weak.
Hypertension was not related to FGF23 and therefore can￾not explain the rise in proteinuria with increasing FGF23
levels. Another explanation may be that proteinuria itself
increases FGF23. This may be mediated by the association
of proteinuria with vitamin D homeostasis [25]. Proteinuria
however is associated with vitamin D deficiency and there￾fore a decline in FGF23 would have been expected, giving
the observed increase in FGF23 levels seen upon supple￾mentation with activated vitamin D in experimental mod￾els [26]. As patients with proteinuria received active
vitamin D more frequently (shown in Table 4), this use of
active vitamin D was added to the fully adjusted model
(Table 3). Active vitamin D use however, did not explain
the higher levels of FGF23 in patients with proteinuria.
Another potential mechanism that could link proteinuria
with FGF23 levels is secondary hyperparathyroidism,
induced by deficiency of vitamin D that accompanies pro￾teinuria. Adding lnPTH to the fully adjusted model how￾ever, did not mitigate the association of proteinuria with
FGF23. A more likely explanation is that the toxic effects
of proteinuria on tubular function [27,28] also disrupt local
FGF23 signaling, leading to a compensatory increase in
FGF23 production. A final explanation might be that both
proteinuria and an increase in FGF23 are the consequence
of the same underlying process, such as increased oxidative
stress, that could lead to both proteinuria [29] and FGF23
resistance [20]. An association between proteinuria and
FGF23 was also noted in the Heart and Soul study [6].
This study included patients with a mean GFR of 76 ml/
min, and only 4% had macroalbuminuria. Our study, with
mean GFR of 37 ml/min/1.73 m2 and over 10% of patients
having proteinuria > 2 g/day, extends these observations to
patients with more severe CKD and higher levels of protei￾nuria. Fliser and co-workers found an association between
FGF23 and progression of CKD, even after correction for
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), but that correction atte￾nuated the predictive value of FGF23 [30]. In that study the
precise relation between FGF23 and proteinuria was not
studied. In the study by Isakova the association between

FGF23 and progression to end stage kidney disease was no
longer significant after correcting for albumin-to-creatinine
ratio, eGFR, albumin and hemoglobin, but the risk for
mortality remained significant [23].
We found no modulating effect of either 25D or 1,25D
levels on FGF23. This lack of evidence for an association
of FGF23 with levels of vitamin D metabolites can be
explained by the fact that active vitamin D induces FGF23
production [26] while FGF23 in turn catabolizes 25D and
1,25D [31], thus counterbalancing possible relationships
between vitamin D and FGF23.
It needs to be pointed out that some associations pre￾sent in Model 2 were no longer present in the analysis in
which vitamin D was included. There are two factors to
explain this. Firstly the number of participants in this lat￾ter analysis is much lower (604 in model 2; 126 in vitamin
D analysis). In addition proteinuria was dichotomized in
two categories (more or less than 2 gr/24 hours), which
reduces the discriminatory value of this variable in linear
regression.
Accumulating evidence points to FGF23 as a novel risk
factor for mortality and progression of CKD [3,23]. Our
findings show that a part of the increased cardiovascular
risk of smoking [32] and proteinuria [33] in CKD may
thus be explained by its effects on FGF23, assuming that
FGF23 has direct detrimental effects. This may indicate
that FGF23 has a causal role in cardiovascular complica￾tions in CKD, but this still is still debated, because of the
possibility of residual confounding within these studies
and the lack of definitive proof of a pathobiological
mechanism by which FGF23 presumably induces harm.
Recent evidence however does suggest that FGF23 is
directly involved in the evolution of pathological left ven￾tricular hypertrophy in mice [9]. For some factors, like
GFR[1???] and phosphate level [34,35], both reasonably
established novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease, its
relationship with FGF23 is well described. However, pre￾vious studies demonstrated that the predictive value of
FGF23 for clinical endpoints remained significant, even
after correcting for these factors that are involved in its
production, providing additional arguments for the notion
that FGF23 might be more than just a risk marker.
Some limitations of our study need to be mentioned.
First, our study is a cross-sectional observational analysis,
thus we cannot determine temporal relationships and
causality. Next, it could be possible that FGF23 influences
proteinuria, instead of the other way around. Indirect evi￾dence for the latter comes from the observation that pro￾tein (and phosphate) restriction improves albuminuria
[36]. In addition, we also cannot answer the clinically
relevant question whether modulating proteinuria or
smoking cessation can lower FGF23 and if FGF23 decline
accomplished by these measures reduces cardiovascular
risk (independent from risk reduction by smoking
cessation alone and proteinuria reduction). Such a ques￾tion requires a RCT.
There are currently two techniques available to mea￾sure FGF23: intact FGF23 and c-terminal FGF23. The
former assay is positive only in the presence of full-length
FGF23, while the latter also measures the c-terminal
truncated FGF23. In our study we did not measure intact
FGF23, but in advanced CKD the two assays have been
shown to perform similarly [37]. We were able to test
25D and 1,25D levels in a subset only, which weakens
our conclusion that vitamin D metabolites had no rela￾tion with FGF23. Indeed, a recent study suggests that
higher FGF23 was associated with lower 1,25D levels [4].
However, proteinuria was not measured in that study.
Strengths of our study are the large sample size, the pro￾spective nature of data collection and the use of 24 hour
urine collections instead of using albumin-to-creatinine
ratio in spot urine samples, which provides more reliable
quantitative data [38].
Our findings can have important implications. If
FGF23 indeed has a causative role in cardiovascular dis￾ease and is involved in progression of CKD, an impor￾tant next step would be to test the hypothesis that
dietary or pharmacological interventions aimed at a
reduction of FGF23 improves these outcomes. The
obvious tools to lower FGF23 would be a phosphate￾restricted diet [15], phosphate-binder therapy [39-41] or
calcimimetics [42]. Our findings support the hypothesis
that early intervention aiming at reducing proteinuria
and cessation of smoking may be another tool to reduce
FGF23.
Conclusion
In patients with CKD FGF23 is significantly associated
with proteinuria and smoking, along with other, already
established associations, like eGFR (inverse relation),
plasma phosphate level, PTH, history of cardiovascular
disease and diabetes mellitus. The clinical relevance of
this finding is the fact that both proteinuria and smok￾ing are modifiable. Future prospective randomized trial,
or post-hoc analyses of existing cohorts, can reveal if
targeted anti-proteinuric therapy lowers FGF23, and if
this assumed reduction is independently associated with
improved outcome. Since the causal relationship
between FGF23 and proteinuria can be two-sided, an
additional question is the impact of targeting FGF23 to
lower proteinuria. The relation of FGF23 with smoking
provides an additional argument to discourage this
habit.
