Severe diarrhea is a serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 
Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been one of the major causes of diarrhea after HSCT, which 
is triggered by donor-derived cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. On the other hand, intestinal thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA) sometimes coexists with acute GVHD, and intensified immunosuppression to treat 
acute GVHD could exacerbate intestinal TMA, presumably through the vascular endothelial cell damage. 
The differential diagnosis between intestinal TMA and acute GVHD of the gut has mainly relied on the 
pathological findings, as clinical diagnosis of intestinal TMA has not been established. Therefore, we aimed 
to assess the feasibility of our clinical diagnosis for the patients with diarrhea after HSCT. We made 
tentative clinical criteria for intestinal TMA and acute GVHD of the gut, based on the clinical manifestations, 
laboratory data and colonoscopic findings, and started treatment before pathological diagnosis were made. 
Subsequently, a pathologist retrospectively assessed the accuracy of clinical diagnosis in a blind manner. 
In this study, we enrolled 19 patients complicating watery diarrhea after HSCT, and diagnosed as having 
acute GVHD (n = 10), intestinal TMA (n = 3), or both (n = 6) according to our criteria. We demonstrated 
that our clinical diagnosis for intestinal TMA and acute GVHD of the gut was overall correct, in terms of the 
response to the therapy and the pathological diagnosis. The present study may provide a clue on making 
clinical diagnosis of patients with watery diarrhea after HSCT, which enables us to start a prompt therapy.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an important 
therapeutic option to bring cure for patients with hemato￾logical malignancies. However, there remain unsolved 
problems in managing transplantation-related complica￾tions. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) after hemato￾poietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a serious com￾plication impairing the long-term survival rate after HSCT 
(Pettitt and Clark 1994; Zeigler et al. 1995). Clinical pre￾sentation of TMA is variable, often mimicking other forms 
of TMA, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Though the detailed 
mechanism of TMA has not been clarified yet, damage of 
vascular endothelial cells by conditioning regimen and use 
of calcineurin inhibitor are supposed to be an indispensable 
factor. The diagnosis of TMA is usually based on clinical 
and laboratory findings, such as increased red blood cell 
fragmentation and serum lactic dehydrogenase (Ho et al. 
2005; Ruutu et al. 2007). However, it is difficult to make a 
definite diagnosis of TMA due to the heterogeneity of etiol￾ogies and clinical findings.
Nishida et al. (2004) and Narimatsu et al. (2005) 
reported case series of localized intestinal TMA. Of note, 
the patient’s intestinal symptoms were improved after the 
reduction of immunosuppressants (Nishida et al. 2004; 
Narimatsu et al. 2005). In support of this, Fujino et al. 
(2007) established a rat model of intestinal TMA induced 

32 M. Yamada-Fujiwara et al.
by tacrolimus without irradiation. Therefore, it seems pos￾sible to consider that the gut could be a target for TMA, and 
the use of calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A and 
tacrolimus could exacerbate its symptom. As the reduction 
of immunosuppressants is an opposite treatment for acute 
GVHD, differentiating intestinal TMA from acute GVHD is 
important.
Pathological examination of the intestine seems essen￾tial to make a diagnosis of intestinal TMA, but it usually 
takes a time for the analysis. Therefore, in our institute, if 
patients developed diarrhea more than 0.5 L/day, we made 
a clinical diagnosis based on clinical manifestations, labora￾tory data and colonoscopic findings and started treatment. 
However, it remains unproved whether clinical diagnosis of 
intestinal TMA and acute GVHD of gut predicts the patho￾logical diagnosis. Therefore, we designed a study to deter￾mine the accuracy of our clinical diagnosis of patients who 
showed watery diarrhea after HSCT by retrospectively 
reviewing the correlation between their clinical diagnosis 
and pathological findings as well as clinical outcome.
Patients and Methods
Patients and Study Protocol
Between March 2001 and March 2006, 73 patients underwent 
HSCT at the Department of Hematology and Rheumatology in 
Tohoku University Hospital (Fig. 1). Among them, 20 patients 
(27.4%) showed watery diarrhea more than 0.5 L/day after HSCT and 
all received colon fiber examination. Based on colonoscopic findings 
and laboratory data, patients were judged as having GVHD, TMA or 
both. A patient, whose diarrhea was considered mainly due to cyto￾megalovirus enterocolitis, was not included for the analysis. In the 
patients with GVHD, the addition of prednisolone (PSL) was princi￾pally considered, but not indispensable, depending on patients’ gen￾eral status. On the other hand, a calcineurin inhibitor was reduced in 
cases with intestinal TMA. In the mixed type, the reduction of calci￾neurin inhibitors and the addition of steroid or mycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF) were adopted.
On January 2006, all biopsy specimens of the gut were retro￾spectively examined by a pathologist (Dr. Masafumi Ito), without any 
clinical information. Of 20 diarrhea patients, one patient was 
excluded for the analysis because the biopsy specimen was not suit￾able for pathological diagnosis. Thus, the 19 patients’ records as well 
as pathological results were retrospectively analyzed in the present 
study. Characteristics of 19 patients are shown in Table 1. All 
patients gave written informed consents.
Colonoscopic examination
A colonoscopy, including mucosal biopsies, was conducted for 
all patients as described previously (Oomori et al. 2005).
Fig. 1. Study design.
Patients complicating watery diarrhea (0.5 L/day or more) after HSCT were diagnosed as having TMA, GVHD or 
mixed type based on physical examination, laboratory and colonoscopic findings. In the patients with intestinal TMA, 
calcineurin inhibitor was reduced, while the addition of predonisone was principally considered for the treatment of 
GVHD. In the mixed type, the reduction of calcineurin inhibitors and the addition of steroid or mycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF) were adopted. On the other hand, biopsy specimens of the gut were retrospectively analyzed by the pathologist 
in a blinded manner, and then a correlation of clinical diagnosis/outcome and pathological results were analyzed.

Clinicopathological Analysis of Intestinal TMA and GVHD 33
Diagnostic criteria of intestinal TMA and GVHD
As soon as the occurrence of diarrhea, the diagnosis of intesti￾nal TMA and/or GVHD was made comprehensively, according to 
physical examination, laboratory data and colonoscopic findings. 
Severe abdominal pain requiring morphine, bloody stool, and an 
occurrence of diarrhea during steroid therapy were possible signs of 
intestinal TMA. Laboratory findings for the diagnosis of TMA were 
basically based on the international criteria for TMA (Ho et al. 2005; 
Ruutu et al. 2007). However, few patients fulfilled the criteria, pre￾sumably because they were applied for the diagnosis of completed 
systemic TMA. Thus, we defined it as “possible TMA” if any two or 
more of the criteria, including increased LDH, thrombocytopenia, ret￾iclocytosis and anemia without bleeding, RBC fragmentation 
> 1.2%, were observed (Table 2). Endoscopic findings suggestive of 
intestinal TMA include i) mucosal petechiae or ii) diffuse exfoliation, 
which would reflect ischemic colitis (Scowcroft et al. 1981) (Fig. 
2A-e,f), whereas those of GVHD include i) mucosal edema, ii) loss of 
transparence of vascular pattern, and iii) mucosal defects visualized 
by indigo carmine stain (Cruz-Correa et al. 2002; Oomori et al. 2005) 
(Fig. 2A-a,b). Both findings were observed in the mixed type (Fig. 
2A-c,d). Diagnosis of clinical intestinal TMA was made from colo￾noscopic findings and at least one positive finding of physical exami￾nation or laboratory “possible TMA”. Diagnosis of clinical intestinal 
GVHD was made primarily from colonoscopic findings. Accordingly, 
patients with diarrhea was diagnosed and treated as described above. 
Colonoscopy and biopsy of colon were performed in all patients, 
however, none of these cases required changes of the treatment owing 
to the pathological results.
Response criteria
Evaluation of the response to the therapy was made primarily 
two weeks after the initiation. However, the response to the second 
step (ex. addition of MMF) was assessed from two weeks to four 
weeks further. Decrease of the diarrhea below 0.5 L/day was quali￾fied as positive response.
Histopathological examination
Histopathological evaluation for 19 patients with diarrhea was 
performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. 
Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections were reviewed retrospectively by 
the pathologist without clinical information. Microangiopathy with 
ischemic (non-inflammatory) crypt loss was diagnostic of intestinal 
TMA (Inamoto et al. 2009). Ischemic changes caused by microangi￾opathy were as follows: non-inflammatory crypt degeneration with 
detachment and apoptosis of epithelial cells, wedge-shaped segmental 
injury, and interstitial hemorrhage or fragmented red blood cells (Fig. 
2B-a, b). Pathological diagnosis of GVHD was made by the presence 
of apoptosis with intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. 2B-c).
Results and Discussion
Ten patients were diagnosed as acute GVHD on the 
basis of clinical and endoscopic findings. None of the 
patients were pretreated by PSL. Among them, 9 patients 
were treated with steroid administration and 8 patients 
responded. The non-responder and the other one patient 
were improved gradually by the supportive care. Total 
response rate in this group was 100%. Survival rate at 1 
year after HSCT is 90%. The pathological findings of 
GVHD were recognized in 6 patients (60%). Pathological 
findings, which suggest ischemic changes, were also 
pointed out in 9 patients (90%), although 7 were confined 
to subtle findings. These results suggested that clinical 
diagnosis of GVHD seemed generally correct, although the 
pathologist found some ischemic changes in almost all 
patients. The coexistence of subtle ischemic changes 
among GVHD cases might result from the use of condition￾ing regimen and calcineurin inhibitors, though the presence 
of GVHD itself could not be excluded (Biedermann 2008; 
Tichelli and Gratwohl 2008).
Among 6 patients who were clinically diagnosed as 
mixed type, 4 patients (patients 12, 13, 14, and 15) were 
improved by the reduction of calcineurin inhibitors and the 
addition of steroid or MMF (response rate: 66.7%).

Pretreatment with PSL for other cause than GVHD was 
administered in patients 11, 12, and 16. The dose of PSL 
administration was 1 mg/kg for patient 13, and 2 mg/kg for 
other patients. MMF was administered in 2 patients 
(patients 15 and 16) at the dose of 1,000 mg/day. Concur￾rently with the clinical results, these mixed-type cases were 
well correlated with pathological findings. Comparing to 
the GVHD cases, the extent of ischemic changes were more 
obvious pathologically in mixed-type cases. Therefore, for 
the mixed-type patients, the reduction of calcineurin inhibi￾tor and/or the addition of MMF, which has less toxicity to 
vascular endothelial cells (Eugui and Allison 1993), might 
improve the prognosis. Further prospective studies are war￾ranted to address these points.
The clinical diagnosis of intestinal TMA was made in 
3 patients (patients 17, 18, and 19) and was in complete 
accord with the pathological diagnosis (Table 2). Two 
patients were pretreated with PSL at the onset of diarrhea 
(patients 17 and 18). Among them, one patient (patient 17) 
improved after the reduction of tacrolimus (response rate: 
33.3%). We speculated that the refractory cases (patients 
18 and 19) showed widespread mucosal exfoliation in colo￾Table 2. Clinical findings, pathological diagnosis and outcome.

(A) Colonoscopic findings of intestinal GVHD (a,b), mixed-type (c,d) and TMA (e,f). Mucosal edema and loss of trans￾parence of vascular pattern were observed in GVHD (a), whereas, mucosal petechiae (c,e) and diffuse exfoliation (f) 
were observed in intestinal TMA. Indigo carmine stain was performed to visualize characteristic mucosal defects in 
GVHD(b,d). (B) Pathological findings of intestinal TMA (a,b) and GVHD (c) (HE stain). Microangiopathy with crypt 
loss (a: indicated by arrowheads) and interstitial hemorrhage (b) were observed in cases with intestinal TMA. Apoptotic 
epithelial cells with intraepithelial lymphocytes were observed in GVHD (c: indicated by arrowheads).

noscopy were already in the irreversible, advanced stage of 
intestinal TMA at the time of clinical diagnosis. Together 
with the high correlation between clinical and pathological 
results in the mixed type, we suggest that the colonoscopic 
findings of mucosal petechiae or diffuse exfoliation might 
be applicable criteria for the diagnosis of intestinal TMA or 
vascular damage.
Prior to the onset of colitis, 5 patients (patients 11, 12, 
16, 17, and 18) were already administered steroid for some 
reasons, other than for GVHD treatment. It is noticeable 
that all 5 patients showed considerable ischemic changes. 
Paqutte et al. (1998) suggested that the combined use of 
CyA and MTX and glucocorticoids as GVHD prophylaxis 
might predispose to the development of TMA by multivari￾ate analysis. As steroid reportedly has adverse effects on 
vascular endothelial cells and platelets (Blajchman et al. 
1979; Lewis et al. 1986; Yoshioka et al. 2007), we consider 
that steroid treatment might be also a risk factor of develop￾ment of intestinal TMA.
Recently, Inamoto et al. (2009) reported that intensi￾fied immunosuppression before or after diarrhea following 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation increased non-relapse 
mortality, and suggested that avoiding intensified immuno￾suppression, which damages vascular endothelium, might 
improve transplant outcome. In our case series, the patients 
without mucosal petechiae or hemorrhage colonoscopically 
responded well to steroid administration (patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 
6, 8, and 9). We suggest that especially the colonoscopic 
findings of mucosal petechiae or hemorrhage may reflect 
ischemic changes or intestinal TMA, and avoiding further 
vascular damages in those patients is important for 
improvement of transplant outcome.
Our analysis suggested that the clinical diagnosis of 
diarrhea after HSCT based on physical examination, labora￾tory data and colonoscopic findings was well correlated to 
the response to the therapy and the pathological diagnosis. 
As intestinal TMA could be a contributing cause of death 
when it develops to irreversible stage, an early clinical 
diagnosis of intestinal TMA, with the prompt initiation of 
appropriate therapies, might contribute to favorable results.
