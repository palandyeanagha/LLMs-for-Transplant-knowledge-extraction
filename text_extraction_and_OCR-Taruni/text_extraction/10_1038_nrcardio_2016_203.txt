Heart failure (HF) is associated with substantial clin￾ical burden and economic costs worldwide. The dis￾ease is particularly prevalent in elderly individuals, in 
whom the incidence and associated costs are projected 
to double over the next 20 years1,2
. Economic costs 
associated with the management of patients with HF 
is estimated at >US$30 billion annually in the USA 
alone, and accounts for roughly 2–3% of total health￾care spending globally3,4
. Despite these enormous costs, 
mortality from HF remains high. Death from HF within 
5 years of diagnosis is common despite current opti￾mal medical therapy. Mortality and rehospitalization 
within 60–90 days after discharge from hospital can 
be as high as 15% and 35%, respectively5
. These event 
rates have largely not changed over the past 15 years, 
despite implementation of evidence-based therapy5
. 
HF rehospitalization rates also remain high, with care 
typically focused on symptomatic relief. Patients with 
HF are often designated as having either reduced ejec￾tion fraction (HFrEF), or preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF). Patients with HFpEF also have poor prognosis 
after the first diagnosis6
. Regardless of the HF aetiology, 
novel treatments that improve intrinsic cardiac function 
remain elusive.
Advances in the treatment of ischaemic and valvu￾lar heart disease have clearly improved patient sur￾vival. The residual cardiac dysfunction and associated 
comorbidities, however, have led, in the long-term, to 
the development of HF with attendant poor quality of 
life. Commonly prescribed HF medications, although 
beneficial in promoting some symptom relief, often do 
not fully address the underlying causes of progressive 
left ventricular dysfunction7
. Most standard-of‑care 
pharmacological approaches to HF act by reducing 
workload on the failing heart and, in doing so, attempt to 
rebalance energy supply and energy demand, albeit to a 
lower level (FIG. 1). Hallmarks of current therapies include 
modulation of neurohormonal abnormalities, unloading 
the heart (that is, vasodilatation), and/or reducing the 
heart rate — all important determinants of reducing 
myocardial oxygen consumption8
. β‑Blockers, ivabradine, 
and antagonism of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone 
system all act in concert to reduce myocardial energy 
requirements and attenuate or prevent further adverse 
cardiac remodelling. Although these therapies have 
improved survival in patients with chronic ambulatory 
HFrEF over the past 2–3 decades, death and poor qual￾ity of life continue to adversely affect this ever-increasing

Abstract | Heart failure is a pressing worldwide public-health problem with millions of patients 
having worsening heart failure. Despite all the available therapies, the condition carries a very 
poor prognosis. Existing therapies provide symptomatic and clinical benefit, but do not fully 
address molecular abnormalities that occur in cardiomyocytes. This shortcoming is particularly 
important given that most patients with heart failure have viable dysfunctional myocardium, 
in which an improvement or normalization of function might be possible. Although the 
pathophysiology of heart failure is complex, mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be an important 
target for therapy to improve cardiac function directly. Mitochondrial abnormalities include 
impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain activity, increased formation of reactive oxygen 
species, shifted metabolic substrate utilization, aberrant mitochondrial dynamics, and altered ion 
homeostasis. In this Consensus Statement, insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in heart failure are presented, along with an overview of emerging treatments 
with the potential to improve the function of the failing heart by targeting mitochondria.

patient population. This unmet need is probably not 
going to be met by drugs that modulate neurohormonal 
abnormalities and lower heart rates, because further inter￾vention along these axes is likely to be counterproductive 
as hypotension and bradycardia become limiting factors. 
The search for more effective and complementary therapy 
for this patient population must be focused on improv￾ing the intrinsic function of the viable, but dysfunctional, 
cardiac unit — the cardiomyocytes3,9
. The novel therapy 
must be haemodynamically neutral (no decrease in blood 
pressure or heart rate) and must target the myocardium as 
the centrepiece of the therapeutic intervention10.
The vast majority of phase III trials in patients with 
HF conducted in the past decade have been negative, 
arguably for the same reasons discussed above11,12. 
Furthermore, a relative underinvestment in cardiovascu￾lar drug development, as well as strategic abandonment 
by pharmaceutical companies of new therapies for which 
the risks are perceived to be higher than the rewards, have 
also contributed to slow development of drugs for HF13. 
Moreover, the development of effective therapies for 
HFpEF is imperative to treat this patient population, but 
the variability in HFpEF phenotypes (such as age, and the 
presence of diabetes mellitus or hypertension), and 
the difficulty in establishing reliable preclinical models 
of HFpEF, also hinder progress. Despite these obstacles, 
ample opportunity exists to improve HF treatments, 
provided the focus is directed towards cardiomyocytes 
and their intrinsic function.
A roundtable meeting was held in Stresa, Italy on 
23 October 2015 to discuss the multifaceted problem 
of insufficient energy production in HF, and the role 
it has in progressive left ventricular dysfunction. This 
meeting was attended by academics, clinicians, and 
representatives from the pharmaceutical industry. The 
meeting focused on mitochondrial dysfunction as the 
source of energy deprivation in HF, and how correction 
of mitochondrial dysfunction using emerging novel 
therapies might lead to functional improvement of the 
HF phenotype. This Consensus Statement summarizes 
the findings from that roundtable discussion.
Bioenergetics of the beating heart
Aristotle considered the heart to be the body’s fur￾nace, radiating energy in the form of heat14. Given the 
astounding energetic cost of cardiac function, this con￾cept is not so far from the truth. Humans produce and 
consume roughly their body weight in ATP (about 65kg) 
every single day15. The heart accounts for only ~0.5% of 
body weight, but is responsible for roughly 8% of ATP 
consumption. This high energy flux is dynamic: the 
heart stores only enough energy to support pumping 
for a few heart beats, turning over the entire metabo￾lite pool approximately every 10 s even at resting heart 
rates16. As the most metabolically active organ in the 
body, the heart possesses the highest content of mito￾chondria of any tissue. Mitochondria comprise 25–30% 
of cell volume across mammalian species17,18, with only 
the myofilaments being more densely packed within 
cardiac myocytes. The high mitochondrial content of 
cardiomyocytes is needed to meet the enormous energy 
requirement for contraction and relaxation (which is 
also an active process). About 90% of cellular ATP 
is utilized to support the contraction–relaxation cycle 
within the myocardium19. ATP-dependent release of 
actin from myosin is required for both contraction 
(as myosin heads cycle through cross-bridges with actin) 
and relaxation. Cellular sequestration of calcium back 
into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during diastole also 
requires a tremendous amount of ATP. Cells sustain 
the energy requirements necessary to support cardiac 
function through remarkable metabolic supply–demand 
matching20,21 (FIG. 1). Bioenergetic homeostasis is accom￾plished almost exclusively through an ‘energy grid’ com￾prised of a mitochondrial network and their associated 
phosphate-transfer couples. Cardiac mitochondria 
must operate at high efficiency levels to respond instan￾taneously to the energetic needs of contractile units, 
a demand that is ever-changing and necessitated by the 
body’s dynamic requirements for oxygen-bearing blood.
Myocardial energy requirements are more pro￾nounced during physical activity, when demands for 
energy increase to maintain cardiac function commensur￾ate with the needs of the body. However, other mitochon￾drial abnormalities besides energy deprivation during 
physical activity can contribute to the pathologies seen 
in patients with HF. Mitochondrial abnormalities in HF 
are not only a question of reduced capacity to generate 
ATP (even though that capacity is reduced at rest in HF 
compared with resting normal), but can also be directly

linked to cardiomyocyte injury and death and, therefore, 
to disease progression. Abnormal mitochondria are a 
major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produc￾tion, which can induce cellular damage. Abnormal mito￾chondria can promote programmed cell death through 
the release of cytochrome c into the cytosolic compart￾ment and activation of caspases. Therefore, mitochon￾dria directly influence ongoing cell injury and death. 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have also been implicated 
in aberrant cellular calcium homeostasis, vascular smooth 
muscle pathology, myofibrillar disruption, and altered 
cell differentiation, all important issues in cardiovascular 
disease, including HF.
Mitochondria in cardiomyocytes
Mitochondria are primarily located within subsarco￾lemmal, perinuclear, and intrafibrillar regions of the 
cardiomyocyte. Although they are symbiotic partners 
with the other cellular compartments, mitochondria are 
in many ways discrete entities. Mitochondrial dynamics 
in the form of fission, fusion, and autophagy are highly 
regulated processes that are essential for energy produc￾tion and structural integrity of the organelles22–29. Altered 
mitochondrial biogenesis, fragmentation, and hyper￾plasia have been observed in studies of human30 and 
animal models31,32 of HF. These effects seem to be caused 
by altered expression of proteins that regulate mitochon￾drial dynamics33. As many of these factors are ‘master 
regulators’ of mitochondrial metabolism, these changes 
might be directly related to the decreased capacity to 
oxidize fatty acid substrates often seen in HF34,35.
Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA) and a 
genetic code that is distinct from the host-cell nuclear 
DNA. mtDNA is circular in shape, analogous to DNA 
found in lower organisms, and a primitive fingerprint 
leftover from bacterial origin. Evolutionary selection 
pressures have led to mitochondria ‘outsourcing’ almost 
all their protein-making needs to their cellular hosts. The 
overwhelming majority (>99%) of mitochondrial pro￾teins come from nuclear-encoded DNA. These proteins 
are synthesized via cellular protein synthesis machinery, 
and are actively imported into mitochondria through 
mitochondrial membrane transporters36. mtDNA 
encodes 13 protein subunits found within three of the 
electron transport protein complexes, and a handful 
of ribosomal and transfer RNAs37. These proteins are 
Figure 1 |Energy supply–demand matching in health and heart failure. The 
delicate balance between cardiac demands for energy and supply of energy 
is tipped in heart failure, in which energy supply cannot match demand. 
Next-generation therapeutics can improve on existing standard-of‑care 
therapies by bolstering mitochondrial energy production. ACE, angioten￾sin-converting enzyme; ARB, angiotensin II‑receptor blocker; ETC, electron

made in specialized ribosomes or ‘mitoribosomes’, 
which are physically attached to the mitochondrial 
inner membrane38.
Many inherited familial cardiomyopathies (both 
adult and paediatric) are associated with mtDNA 
mutations39. In humans, mitochondria are maternally 
inherited40, owing to high mitochondrial density in the 
egg and the active degradation of mitochondria in the 
sperm during fertilization41. The proximity of mtDNA 
to sites of mitochondrial ROS generation, poor repair 
mechanisms, and a lack of protective histones combine 
to make mtDNA particularly susceptible to oxidative 
injury and mutation.
Mitochondrial genetics contribute to cardiomyo￾pathies by expressing mutant proteins that influence 
energy homeostasis. With 1,000–10,000 genes per mito￾chondria (polyploidy), mitochondrial genetics operate 
on population-based (instead of Mendelian) princi￾ples37. Mutated mtDNA is found alongside nonmutated 
copies, leading to mitochondrial ‘heteroplasmy’. The 
extent of heteroplasmy in mutated mtDNA influences 
the susceptibility to inherited mitochondrial disease42. 
Mutated mtDNA can be found in 1 in 200 individuals, 
a frequency that is 20‑fold higher than the incidence 
of mitochondrial disease. This mismatch indicates that 
healthy individuals often harbour mutated mtDNA 
that has no observable phenotypic consequences until 
a certain mutation threshold is reached37. Although 
very early in preclinical development, various innova￾tive approaches to reduce the extent of heteroplasmy 
using genome editing might ultimately lead to effective 
therapy for HF caused by genetic mitochondrial dis￾ease43–45. Given that mitochondrial abnormalities, such 
as increased ROS production, altered mitochondrial 
energetics, and impaired mitochondrial ion homeo￾stasis, are observed in genetic mitochondrial diseases 
as well as HF, innovative approaches that target mito￾chondrial dysfunction might share efficacy across 
these diseases.
Heart failure is a bioenergetic disease
The ‘myocardial power grid’ consists of mitochondrial 
ATP supply that transfers energy throughout the cell 
along intracellular phosphotransfer buffering systems 
(FIG. 2). Mitochondria utilize carbon sources from food 
substrates, which are catabolized and passed through the 
Krebs cycle and are then channelled through a series of 
redox reactions along the inner mitochondrial mem￾brane. The oxidation of these substrates creates a pro￾ton electrochemical gradient, predominantly in the form 
of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)46. Protons 
that re‑enter the mitochondrial matrix through com￾plex V (mitochondrial ATP synthase) liberate energy 
that phosphorylates ADP, regenerating ATP. Newly 
synthesized ATP is rapidly transferred out of mitochon￾dria and energy is subsequently distributed throughout 
the cell via reversible phosphate exchange networks, 
primarily catalysed by creatine kinase and adenylate 
kinase-associated reactions16,47.
The evidence that HF involves impaired cellular 
energy production and transfer is considerable (TABLE 1). 
Among studies that have directly examined energetics 
in human HF, all but three noted some form of bioener￾getic impairment in the failing heart. This decrement in 
bioenergetics is reflected by a decrease in cellular ATP, 
phosphocreatine (PCr), or the PCr/ATP ratio. Impaired 
bioenergetics affect patients with HFrEF and those with 
HFpEF (TABLE 1).
Although it is difficult to tell from the heterogeneous 
patient population included in TABLE 1, the progression 
to HF is likely to be associated with a gradual decline in 
bioenergetic reserve capacity that ultimately reaches a 
critical threshold, after which endogenous mechanisms 
can no longer compensate for faltering energy supply48. 
Attempts to improve bioenergetics in HF tend to focus 
on mitochondrial energy production as a target, because 
direct augmentation of myocardial creatine with oral 
creatine supplementation is thwarted by a decreased 
capacity to transport creatine into the failing cardio￾myocytes49. Skeletal muscles also show mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HF, contributing to the exercise intoler￾ance that characterizes the HF state50. Abnormal mito￾chondrial function has also been reported in patients 
with renal insufficiency51, and in patients with insulin 
resistance52. Given that patients with HF often manifest 
both renal insufficiency and insulin resistance, treating

generate and transfer energy within heart cells results in energy deficits, which influences all cellular processes that 
require energy, most notably the processes of contraction and relaxation.

mitochondrial dysfunction in HF derives benefits that 
go beyond improving cardiac function (FIG. 3).
Several interventions are currently being tested in 
clinical trials to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis 
in HF. These include epicatechin and resveratrol, which 
are naturally-occurring polyphenols found in foods such 
as red wine, green tea, and dark chocolate. Preclinical 
HF models suggest that these molecules are biologically 
active53–55, and some success in improving cardiac func￾tion has been reported in small trials of patients with 
myocardial infarction56. Larger trials in patients with HF 
are required.
Mitochondrial substrate selectivity
Substrate utilization in the failing heart has been exten￾sively reviewed previously57–60. Overall, altered sub￾strate metabolism seems to be centrally involved in HF, 
although the direction of the metabolic alterations is com￾plex and is likely to depend on the particular stage of HF 
progression and differences in the availability of substrate 
(whether the heart is in a ‘fed’ or ‘fasted’ state)58,59.
The heart utilizes different substrates simultaneously 
to produce energy. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation 
(FAO) is the predominate substrate used in the healthy 
adult human heart, being responsible for 60–80% of

cardiac ATP production, followed by lesser contributions 
from glucose, lactate, and ketone bodies61. However, the 
heart can shift the relative contribution of these substrates 
in an effort to adapt to varying physiological conditions. 
Under conditions of low oxygen content, such as ischae￾mia and HF, ATP content is thought to decrease by as 
much as 40%3
. In HF, fatty acid oxidation and the oxid￾ative capacity of the mitochondria decline, and can no 
longer maintain sufficient levels of ATP, especially during 
conditions of increased cardiac workload such as exercise. 
The failing heart shifts its predominant fuel source from 
mitochondrial FAO toward glycolytic pathways. This 
switch is most apparent in late and end-stage HF57, and 
is 30% more energetically efficient in the failing heart, 
because more ATP is produced per mole of oxygen dur￾ing carbohydrate oxidation62. Numerous studies investi￾gating FAO, glucose oxidation, and (to a lesser extent) 
ketone body oxidation have aimed to establish a meta￾bolic phenotype, underlying molecular mechanisms, and 
potential therapeutic targets of the failing heart.
The reduction in fatty acid uptake and FAO that 
occurs during HF might be owing to dysregulated mol￾ecular mechanisms responsible for fatty acid metabolism. 
For example, the level of peroxisome proliferator￾activated receptor‑α (PPARα), a transcription factor 
highly expressed in the heart and responsible for fatty 
acid transport into the mitochondria and peroxisomes, 
has been reported to be downregulated in both animal 
models and humans with HF63,64. Similarly, tissue from 
animals and humans with HF has reduced activity of the 
transcription factor responsible for mitochondrial bio￾genesis, PPAR‑γ co-activator (PGC)‑1α64,65. Because these 
transcription factors have a critical role in the regulation 
of cardiac mitochondrial energy production, these data 
suggest that decreased PPARα and PGC‑1α activity might 
be an important precursor leading to impaired FAO dur￾ing HF. Therefore, further inhibition of FAO to increase 
glycolytic flux via PPARα and/or PGC‑1α is a plausible 
therapeutic target. Small-molecule regulators of PGC‑1α 
are needed, and animal models overexpressing the tran￾scription factor are inherently problematic, ostensibly 
owing to increased mitochondrial biogenesis-induced 
cardiomyopathy66. Similarly, PPARα antagonists in 
animal models of HF have yielded inconclusive data67, 
whereas clinical PPARα ligands are reportedly safe, but 
their efficacy in a HF population is currently unknown61. 
Although the safety of PPARα ligands is promising, fur￾ther evidence demonstrating their efficacy in both animal 
models and humans with HF is needed.
Levels of circulating free fatty acids might be higher 
in the failing heart than under healthy conditions owing 
to hormonal stimulation. The rise in serum catechola￾mine levels increases plasma free fatty acid concentra￾tions, and subsequently stimulates FAO68. As a result, 
reducing the availability of circulating free fatty acids 
via transient adrenergic antagonists might be a viable 
therapy to inhibit FAO and increase glycolytic ATP 
production. Traditionally, β‑adrenergic receptor antago￾nists are used in HF owing to their negative ionotropic 
effects that reduce cardiac workload and spare oxygen 
by decreasing sympathetic activity68. Many, such as 
carvedilol, have been clinically shown to lessen infarct 
size after ischaemia by decreasing sympathetic activity, 
followed by inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake 
and increased glucose oxidation69.
Malonyl‑CoA endogenously regulates fatty acid 
concentrations by controlling the activity of carnitine 
O‑palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1, a rate-limiting enzyme 
in mitochondrial fatty acid uptake68. When intracellular 
levels of malonyl‑CoA are increased, CPT1 is inhibited 
and mitochondrial fatty acid uptake is stopped70. The 
intracellular concentration of malonyl‑CoA is depend￾ent on the balance between its synthesis via acetyl‑CoA 
carboxylase and degradation via malonyl‑CoA decar￾boxylase. Therefore, the upregulation of acetyl‑CoA 
carboxylase or inhibition of malonyl‑CoA decarboxyl￾ase would increase intracellular malonyl‑CoA levels, and 
prevent mitochondrial uptake of free fatty acids to reduce 
FAO. As expected, inhibiting malonyl‑CoA decarboxyl￾ase in animal models has reportedly improved cardiac 
function after ischaemia, reduced cardiac FAO, and 
increased glycolytic flux71,72. Studies of malonyl‑CoA 
decarboxylase inhibitors in patients with HF are needed.
Trends in glucose oxidation across the spectrum of 
HF are more variable, particularly among animal models 
of HF58. Compensatory substrate switching towards glu￾cose use has been observed in both animal models and 
humans59, with a higher contribution coming from glyco￾lysis. Stimulating mitochondrial glucose oxidation, either 
directly or by inhibiting fatty acid catabolism, has been 
suggested as a viable therapeutic strategy to compensate 
for the energetically ‘starved’ failing heart59.
Ketone body metabolism also seems to be altered in 
HF. Ketones are formed in the liver via fatty acid metabo￾lism, and provide a small substrate pool for oxidation 
within the myocardium. In conditions such as diabetes or 
starvation, ketone catabolism is upregulated in response 
to lowered insulin availability and higher fatty acid lev￾els57,73. Studies have reported increased ketone utiliza￾tion in the severely failing heart in humans73,74. Further 
research is needed to understand the role of ketone 
oxidation in the failing myocardium, and to determine

whether targeting ketone metabolism is a plausible 
therapy to improve energetics in HF.
Novel insights into the regulation of metabolic sub￾strate demand in the heart have been provided through 
studies of microRNAs and acetylation of mitochondrial 
lysine residues. Alterations in microRNA levels through 
any number of upregulation and downregulation events 
can alter substrate utilization in the heart75. Alterations 
in protein levels modulated by microRNA expression 
have been proposed to have important implications 
for glycolysis, β‑oxidation, ketone metabolism, the 
Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain (ETC)75. 
For example, increased levels of ROS can alter calcium 
handling in HF by modifying microRNA that leads 
to inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum 
calcium ATPase (SERCA) 2a transcription75. Post￾translational modification via lysine acetylation has been 
suggested to have an important role in metabolic enzyme 
regulation in the mitochondria59.
Overactivation of the SNS
As all substrates converge on mitochondria, understand￾ing the specific abnormalities that occur in HF is central 
to the development of new treatments. ROS production 
increases in many aetiologies of HF, a phenomenon that 
might be directly related to increased sympathetic nerv￾ous system (SNS) tone76. Sustained sympathetic drive 
and chronically elevated circulating catecholamines — 
processes that are normally transient to mediate acute 
increases in cardiac output — are commonly observed 
in patients with HF (particularly HFrEF)77,78. Chronic 
stimulation of β‑adrenergic receptors has been directly 
linked to mitochondrial ROS production through adren￾ergic receptor-mediated second messenger signalling79,80. 
ROS-mediated initiation of mitochondria-dependent cell 
death cascades has been repeatedly observed after chronic 
sympathetic activation, leading to overall declines in mito￾chondrial function81–86. These processes can be amplified 
by the formation of aminochromes, catecholamine metab￾olites known to impair mitochondrial redox balance87. 
Attenuation of HF pathology with β‑blockers and renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone antagonism has resulted in sub￾stantial clinical improvements88, and is likely to relieve 
some of the mitochondrial dysfunction that accompanies 
increased sympathetic tone. The capacity to complement 
these existing background therapies with compounds that 
directly target mitochondrial dysfunction is a potentially 
promising novel paradigm (FIG. 1).
Increased ROS production
Cellular ROS production occurs when ROS formation 
outpaces or exhausts compensatory signals and over￾whelms endogenous scavenging systems89–91. ROS are 
produced at several different sites within cells, both within 
and outside of mitochondria (reviewed in detail previ￾ously92–95). Mitochondrial ROS production occurs at vari￾ous sites along the inner mitochondrial membrane as well 
as in the mitochondrial matrix by components of the ETC 
and the Krebs cycle, respectively96 (FIG. 4). ROS production 
is typically low under normal physiological conditions93, 
and is kept in check by intracellular and intramitochon￾drial scavenging systems. Pathological ROS levels in the 
heart typically occur when ROS production outpaces 
endogenous scavenging capacity. ROS (and other associ￾ated reactive intermediates) can damage proteins and 
lipids, trigger cell-death cascades, and evoke synchro￾nized collapses in the cellular energy grid97,98. Heightened 
mitochondrial ROS production and downstream ROS￾mediated damage has been reported in patients with HF 
as well as in preclinical models of the disease31,99–101.
Although ROS are typically associated with patho￾logical states, ROS levels in the heart per se are best 
characterized by the term ‘hormesis’: small amounts can 
evoke adaptive signalling and create beneficial, com￾pensatory responses. Modest production of ROS has 
been shown to mediate beneficial myocardial signalling 
involved in physiological responses such as (transient) 
sympathetic drive102, many preconditioning paradigms103, 
cardiac mitochondrial quality control104, and exercise105. 
Exercise training is known to augment endogenous ROS￾scavenging mechanisms in the heart105–107, restore bio￾energetic efficiency in porcine models of HFpEF108, and 
improve symptoms and quality of life in trials involving 
patients with HFrEF109,110 or HFpEF111. Consistent with 
the ROS hormesis concept, several studies have noted 
that administration of high doses of ROS scavengers can 
abolish the beneficial effects of exercise112,113, including 
humans taking oral vitamin C or E supplements114.
Mitochondrial production of ROS depends on the 
mitochondrial membrane potential. Increased expression 
of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins in HF115 might be a 
compensatory mechanism to reduce ROS by ‘uncoupling 
Figure 4 | Impaired mitochondrial energy production along the inner membrane. 
Enzyme complexes responsible for energy production are packed into the mitochondrial 
inner membrane, often with the help of phospholipids such as cardiolipin. Failing 
mitochondria often display altered morphology, decreased ATP-generating capacity, 
heightened production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), abnormal cardiolipin levels, 
and impaired supercomplexes.

to survive’116, whereby a reduction in mitochondrial mem￾brane potential is postulated to lower ROS emission from 
mitochondria. This view is popular and almost dogmatic, 
but the decrease in ROS production by uncoupling is a 
prominent effect during mitochondrial state 4 respiration 
(no ADP). Heart mitochondria, however, are never respir￾ing in state 4. Pathological ROS production in cardio￾myocytes is likely to be more closely linked to decreased 
or collapsed membrane potential and/or depletion of 
the NADPH pool117–119, whereby ROS production over￾whelms endogenous scavenging through mitochondrial 
membrane-dependent mechanisms89.
The repeated lack of benefits of ROS scavenging 
compounds in clinical trials of patients with HF11,120,121
continues to plague cardiovascular drug development, 
suggesting that oxygen radical scavenging per se is not a 
plausible mechanism of action for long-term improve￾ments in HF. Lack of tissue permeability, poor intra￾cellular targeting, and ineffective therapeutic doses 
might contribute to the poor translation of benefits of 
antioxidants to date. This approach to therapy, however, 
might ultimately succeed when novel scavenging com￾pounds that overcome permeability and targeting prob￾lems, such as XJB‑5‑131 (REFS 122,123), mitoTEMPO124,125, 
and EUK8/EUK134 (REFS 126–128), are tested in humans.
Abnormalities of mitochondrial ETC
Decrements in individual electron transport complexes, 
particularly complex I and/or IV activity, have been 
observed in animal models129 and humans35 with HF. 
Electron transport system proteins seem to aggregate 
into functional supercomplexes130–132, and a loss of mito￾chondrial supercomplexes, which is postulated to have a 
causal role in mitochondrial ROS generation133, has been 
noted in HF134.
Several approaches are being developed to improve 
the efficiency of the ETC in HF. The coenzyme  Q 
(ubiquinol/ubiquinone CoQ) pool comprises a redox￾cycling coenzyme found in the ETC. CoQ is typically 
synthesized de novo and undergoes a two-electron reduc￾tion from substrates fed into complexes I and II, and is 
then oxidized as it donates electrons into complex III. 
As a redox cycler, the ubiquinol/ubiquinone couple can 
both accept and donate electrons, depending on the redox 
potential135. Incomplete, one-electron reduction of CoQ 
produces semiquinone, itself a highly reactive radical. 
A reduced CoQ pool could potentially feed electrons 
‘backwards’ towards complex I, which results in reverse 
electron transfer and ROS generation136. Decreased cir￾culating CoQ has been observed in patients with HF137,138, 
with an inverse correlation observed between plasma 
CoQ and mortality139. In the Q‑SYMBIO trial140, the effi￾cacy of CoQ was tested in a small (n=420), double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study in patients with HF and showed a 
reduction in mortality after 2 years of treatment. Although 
the Q‑SYMBIO trial was fairly small, the promising find￾ings triggered interest in the development of other CoQ 
analogues that more effectively target mitochondria. New 
quinone conjugates that are tethered to lipophilic, cationic 
triphenylphosphonium moieties, such as MitoQ, SkQ, and 
other plastoquinones, might improve the delivery of CoQ 
to mitochondria141–143, and have shown some promise in 
preclinical models of HF144. A potential problem with the 
use of these compounds is that they are self-limiting, in 
that they can depolarize mitochondria and inhibit mito￾chondrial respiration at high concentrations145. Several 
short-chain synthetic CoQ analogues are also in devel￾opment, including EPI‑743 (REF. 146) and idebenone147. 
These compounds have shown promise in small trials of 
genetic mitochondrial disease148,149, but have not yet been 
tested in larger trials of human HF.
Aberrant mitochondrial membrane phospholipids in 
HF are integrally involved in ETC dysfunction. A mem￾brane phospholipid integral to optimal function of the 
ETC and whose content and composition are altered in 
HF is cardiolipin. Cardiolipin resides in the inner mito￾chondrial membrane (FIG. 4) and, unlike most phospho￾lipids that have two acyl tails, cardiolipin has four acyl 
chains. In mammalian hearts, these chains are enriched 
with linoleic acid (18:2)4. Cardiolipin decrements are 
observed in both paediatric150 and adult151,152 patients 
with HF. Cardiolipin is essential for the activity of ETC 
complexes, membrane transporters, mitochondrial ion 
homeostasis, and ROS production153. Given that most 
mitochondrial complexes associated with energy prod￾uction are oligomers composed of many subunits, cardio￾lipin is proposed to act as molecular ‘glue’ holding these 
subunits together154–156. Approaches that target cardiolipin 
are likely to improve electron transport across the ETC 
and, in doing so, might be beneficial in treating HF.
A compound that targets cardiolipin in the mito￾chondria that is currently in clinical development is the 
cell-permeable peptide MTP‑131 (also called elamipretide 
or Bendavia). An analogue of MTP‑131 (SS‑31) was seren￾dipitously discovered by Szeto and Schiller in attempts 
to identify small peptides with opioid-receptor binding 
properties157. MTP‑131 has no discernible opioid-receptor 
activity158, but was found to localize to the inner mito￾chondrial membrane159, reduce myocardial ischaemia–
reperfusion injury112,160,161, improve renal function51,162, 
and restore skeletal muscle function163. MTP‑131 is not a 
direct ROS scavenger164, and is postulated to act by inter￾acting with cardiolipin165 to interrupt the vicious cycle of 
ROS-mediated cardiolipin oxidation and subsequent loss 
of energetics119,166. MTP‑131‑mediated improvements in 
mitochondrial energetics have been observed across a 
number of different tissues in animal models of disease, 
including the myocardium161,163,164. Of note, MTP‑131 
can improve mitochondrial bioenergetics by improv￾ing respiratory supercomplex formation (D. A. Brown, 
unpublished work).
MTP‑131 is currently being investigated in several 
phase II clinical trials. Preclinical studies in mouse mod￾els of HF have demonstrated efficacy using MTP‑131. 
In a mouse model of HF induced by aortic constriction, 
MTP‑131 improved left ventricular function, reduced 
hypertrophic remodelling, and restored mitochon￾drial function167. In complementary studies, MTP‑131 
administration substantially reduced maladaptive 
remodelling, preserved cardiac function, lowered 
β‑adrenergic-mediated calcium overload, and restored 
mitochondrial protein expression168–170. A substantial

improvement in cardiac function with MTP‑131 has 
been demonstrated in a porcine model of HFpEF171 and 
a canine model of HFrEF172. Beneficial improvements in 
ejection fraction were associated with improved activity or 
expression of mitochondrial complexes I, IV, and V, and a 
normalization of cardiolipin levels172. As the HF syndrome 
influences many different tissues (FIG. 3), the evidence that 
MTP‑131 also improves skeletal muscle function, exercise 
capacity, and renal function adds to the promise of this 
emerging therapy51,163,173,174.
Blockers of the MPTP
The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) 
is a nonspecific pore that opens in response to increased 
calcium levels and oxidative challenge, and is associated 
with ROS production, apoptotic cell death, and mito￾chondrial dysfunction. Increased proclivity of MPTP 
opening occurs in both acute and chronic heart disease, 
and numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated effi￾cacy in cardiac pathology with MPTP blockers, such as 
cyclosporin, NIM811, and TRO40303 (reviewed previ￾ously175–179). Although the opening of the MPTP has his￾torically been thought of as a pathological event leading to 
cell death, studies now suggest that transient MPTP open￾ing might be a physiological ‘reset’ mechanism to prevent 
mitochondrial calcium overload. Rare, transient openings 
of the MPTP have been observed in individual mitochon￾dria of primary cardiomyocytes180. Small, brief MPTP 
openings were found to be more frequent in HF cardio￾myocytes, and were associated with transient mitochon￾drial depolarization and mitochondrial calcium release. 
If opening of these pores might be a normal compensatory 
mechanism akin to ‘pressure release valves’, the concept of 
treating HF by blocking them becomes increasingly diffi￾cult. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the molecular iden￾tity of the MPTP further complicates the development of 
novel therapies that act on the pore176,181–185. The MPTP 
seems to be comprised of ATP synthase (complex V) 
dimers and to be gated by mitochondrial matrix calcium 
content via cyclophillin D186,187.
Clinical studies have failed to demonstrate efficacy in 
most188,189, but not all190,191, studies; however, most of these 
studies focused on reducing acute cardiac ischaemia–
reperfusion injury and not in limiting left ventricular dys￾function in HF. Chronic administration of cyclosporin has 
been linked with renal pathology and immunosuppres￾sion192,193, and cyclosporin was found to evoke systemic 
hypertension in porcine models of HFpEF194. Accordingly, 
cyclosporin is not an appropriate approach for the long￾term management of HF. Further work with alternative 
MPTP blockers is needed to determine whether inhibit￾ing or delaying MPTP opening is a clinically plausible 
approach to alter the progression of HF.
Cellular/mitochondrial ion homeostasis
Aberrant handling of several different ions within the 
mitochondria has been observed, mostly in animal mod￾els of HF. Heightened levels of free iron can increase 
ROS through Fenton chemistry. Changes in cellular iron 
handling have been noted in HF7,195, and orally-available 
iron chelators such as deferiprone seem to redistribute 
iron from tissues, including the mitochondrial space, 
into the circulation196. Although a potential exists to treat 
HF by chelating cellular iron, no study to date has shown 
functional improvements of the failing heart, although 
several clinical trials are currently underway.
Impaired cellular calcium handling that leads to 
decrements in excitation–contraction coupling is noted 
across HF aetiologies, and contributes to poor cardiac 
mechanics and to arrhythmogenesis197–200. Mitochondria 
can directly influence cellular calcium dynamics, because 
many of the membrane-bound pumps required for cyto￾solic calcium release and removal are energy-dependent 
and ROS-dependent. Altered calcium handling has 
been implicated in HFpEF, in which abnormal calcium 
dynamics impair relaxation. Short-term administration of 
ivabradine to slow the heart rate led to modest benefits in 
patients with HFpEF, ostensibly by providing more time 
for calcium-dependent relaxation201. The vast majority 
of calcium resequestration into the sarcoplasmic reticu￾lum, obligatory for diastolic relaxation, occurs through 
SERCA2a, which has been shown to be downregulated 
in HF202–204. Overexpressing SERCA2a has shown prom￾ise in animal models of HF205,206, although several barri￾ers (such as the development of neutralizing antibodies) 
still exist before gene transfer realizes its full translational 
potential207. Furthermore, increased ROS can oxidize 
proteins associated with the ryanodine receptor calcium￾release channel, which can lead to calcium leaking out of 
the sarcoplasmic reticulum during diastole208. Increased 
intracellular sodium levels in HF209–212 also contribute 
to poor calcium handling through mechanisms involv￾ing sodium–calcium exchange. Given that calcium is 
central to maintaining bioenergetic supply–demand 
matching21,213, sodium overload alters cellular and mito￾chondrial calcium fluxes and impairs bioenergetic 
supply–demand matching in HF214. Although very early 
in development, inhibitors of the mitochondrial sodium–
calcium–(lithium) exchanger215, such as CGP‑37157, have 
been shown to improve cardiac function in preclinical 
models of HF216,217. Inhibiting the sarcolemmal sodium–
calcium exchanger might also be a promising approach, 
as demonstrated in a preclinical model of HFpEF218.
Another compound in clinical development to 
improve cardiac efficiency in HF is omecamtiv mecarbil 
(CK‑1827452). This drug increases the calcium sensitiv￾ity of the myofilaments219, which prolongs the duration 
of systole in animal models and in human HF220–222. Two 
substantial phase IIb, double-blind, randomized studies 
comparing omecamtiv mecarbil and placebo have been 
conducted. In the ATOMIC‑HF trial223, omecamtiv 
mecarbil was administered for 48 h intravenously to 
patients with acute HF. Overall, the study was neutral 
(with some evidence of a symptomatic benefit at higher 
doses), but suggested omecamtiv mecarbil was safe. 
In the COSMIC‑HF trial224, an oral formulation of 
omecamtiv mecarbil was associated with improvements 
in cardiac function over 20 weeks, with an effect that 
persisted for 4 weeks after stopping the drug, suggest￾ing that improved function had produced favourable 
structural remodelling. Despite the promise of omecam￾tiv mecarbil, concerns about elevated levels of serum

troponin225, metabolic inefficiency226, and impaired 
cardiac relaxation227 must be assuaged by larger clin￾ical trials to understand fully whether this approach can 
improve prognosis in HF.
Conclusions
The vast majority of HF trials over the past decade have 
been neutral, and event rates remain unacceptably high. 
Perhaps most alarming, no proven therapies exist for 
patients with worsening chronic HF or HFpEF — popu￾lations that collectively comprise the majority of the total 
HF population. Moreover, although systemic blockade 
of maladaptive neurohormonal responses has improved 
outcomes in HFrEF, these agents also lower blood 
pressure and/or heart rate, and development of new 
haemodynamically active drugs for stepwise addition to 
existing therapies raises safety and tolerability concerns. 
Therefore, an ideal novel therapy would be haemo￾dynamically neutral and target the myocardium as the 
centrepiece of the therapeutic mechanism. In this con￾text, overwhelming evidence from both preclinical and 
clinical studies indicates bioenergetic insufficiency in HF. 
Studies using preclinical models of the disease continue 
to advance our understanding of the cellular and molecu￾lar mechanisms that contribute to poor bioenergetics 
of the failing heart. Considerable potential exists to fill 
this unmet need, mitigate the economic burdens, and 
reduce symptoms in patients with HF by focusing on the 
development of new therapeutic modalities that target 
mitochondrial abnormalities in HF.
