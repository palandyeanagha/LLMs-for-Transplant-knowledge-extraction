Introduction
The development of effective immunosuppressive agents has enabled organ and cell transplantation to become 
a life-saving medical achievement. However, a number of potential adverse events following transplantation 
threaten the health of both the patient and the graft, including posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) 
(1). PTDM affects between 7% and 74% of transplantation patients (with the variance typically being attribut￾ed to center-specific differences in pretransplant screenings and diagnostic tests) (2). Furthermore, the risk for 
PTDM progressively increases in the posttransplantation period, with PTDM incidence increasing linearly 
with time (3). PTDM is associated with reduced graft function, increased graft loss, and increased patient 
mortality, making it both a common and significant complication (4). In PTDM, both reduced insulin secre￾tion and impaired insulin action through the development or worsening of insulin resistance have been pro￾posed as mechanisms (2). The pathogenesis of PTDM is likely multifactorial and shares type 2 diabetes 
genetic risk factors (2, 5). Since treatment with immunosuppressive agents tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus 
(SIR) is associated with PTDM (6–9), elucidating the effect of these immunosuppressive agents on human β
cells may aid the understanding of the pathophysiology and progression of PTDM.
TAC inhibits calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase that controls activation of the 
nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors. Calcineurin inhibition leads to immuno￾suppression by preventing T cell activation and cytokine production (10). The calcineurin/NFAT pathway 
is also active in other cell types, and inhibition in these cells is thought to mediate the various toxicities 
of TAC (10). In pancreatic β cells, calcineurin/NFAT signaling is thought to positively regulate insulin 
Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common and significant complication related 
to immunosuppressive agents required to prevent organ or cell transplant rejection. To elucidate 
the effects of 2 commonly used agents, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (TAC) and the mTOR 
inhibitor sirolimus (SIR), on islet function and test whether these effects could be reversed or 
prevented, we investigated human islets transplanted into immunodeficient mice treated with 
TAC or SIR at clinically relevant levels. Both TAC and SIR impaired insulin secretion in fasted 
and/or stimulated conditions. Treatment with TAC or SIR increased amyloid deposition and islet 
macrophages, disrupted insulin granule formation, and induced broad transcriptional dysregulation 
related to peptide processing, ion/calcium flux, and the extracellular matrix; however, it did not 
affect regulation of β cell mass. Interestingly, these β cell abnormalities reversed after withdrawal of 
drug treatment. Furthermore, cotreatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist completely prevented TAC￾induced β cell dysfunction and partially prevented SIR-induced β cell dysfunction. These results 
highlight the importance of both calcineurin and mTOR signaling in normal human β cell function in 
vivo and suggest that modulation of these pathways may prevent or ameliorate PTDM.

secretion and, in juvenile human islets, β cell proliferation (11, 12). Furthermore, TAC treatment has been 
shown to increase β cell apoptosis in cultured human islets (13, 14).
In contrast, SIR inhibits mTOR, a key regulator of cell metabolism, growth, and proliferation (15). 
Inhibition of mTOR leads to immunosuppression by preventing T and B cell expansion (16). Like the calci￾neurin/NFAT pathway, mTOR signaling is crucial in many cell types, and its inhibition has adverse effects, 
including disruption of glucose homeostasis. In insulin-sensitive tissues, SIR treatment disrupts insulin sig￾nal transduction, causing insulin resistance (2, 17). In mouse islets and human islets in vitro, SIR treatment 
reduces insulin secretion and decreases β cell survival and proliferation (18, 19).
While both TAC and SIR appear to have effects on β cells, existing studies have largely been performed 
in vitro or in murine models and have used a wide range of drug doses and treatment schedules that may 
not be clinically relevant. Importantly, mouse islets show a number of key differences to human islets, 
including in their stress response, proliferation rates, and both basal and stimulated insulin secretion (20–
22). In addition, studies of human islets in vitro have been limited to a few days, not mimicking the clinical 
situation in humans. Thus, findings from prior studies are difficult to translate to patients with PTDM. We 
therefore sought to clarify the β cell effects of TAC or SIR treatment using human islets in an in vivo trans￾plant model that mimics the clinical setting and drug exposure. Here, we show that TAC or SIR treatment 
at clinically relevant levels leads to β cell dysfunction related to multiple islet effects. We also demonstrate 
that TAC- or SIR-induced β cell effects are reversible and that they can, at least partially, be prevented with 
concurrent glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist treatment.
Results
TAC and SIR impair insulin secretion from human β cells at clinically relevant levels in vivo. To investigate immunosup￾pressive drug exposure in a system that would mimic the human islet response in vivo, we used a human islet 
transplant model in the immunosuppressed NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/Sz (NSG) mouse, which has deficiencies 
in both innate and adaptive immunity (23). We first examined the pharmacokinetics of TAC and SIR in the 
NSG mouse and defined dosing regimens that achieved therapeutic drug levels (TAC, 5–20 ng/mL; SIR, 5–20 
ng/mL; refs. 24, 25). Surprisingly, the half-life of TAC in the NSG mouse is much shorter than in humans (2 
hours versus 12 hours); thus, we utilized 0.25 mg/kg/day delivered by an implanted osmotic pump to achieve 
clinically relevant levels (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with 
this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.130770DS1). For SIR treatment, we found that drug clearance 
varied drastically between mouse strains, highlighting the importance of robustly characterizing dosing regimens 
in each model when studying these drugs in mice. Ultimately, 0.2 mg/kg of SIR delivered via i.p. injection every 
72 hours achieved clinically relevant concentrations in the NSG mouse (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 
1B). These doses are much lower than used in prior studies, which did not report levels of these drugs; this raises 
questions about the clinical relevance and translational potential of prior findings.
Two weeks following engraftment of human islets, mice began treatment with TAC, SIR, or saline for 
4 weeks (Figure 1C). Human islet preparations were analyzed for viability, purity, and function by perifu￾sion analysis; only islets that passed stringent quality control were used for subsequent studies (Supplemen￾tal Table 1) (26). We verified targeting of the mTOR pathway by showing that SIR treatment drastically 
reduced ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation at 2 critical motifs, Ser235/236 and Ser240/244 in human 
grafts (Supplemental Figure 2, A–H). Interestingly, TAC also decreased S6 phosphorylation.
Both TAC-treated and SIR-treated mice showed impaired glucose handling by glucose tolerance testing 
(GTT), with SIR treatment showing greater impairment, likely reflecting SIR-induced insulin resistance 
(17) (aggregate, Figure 1, D and E; individual donors, Supplemental Figure 3). Mice treated with TAC 
had no change in fasting blood glucose, while mice treated with SIR showed a slightly higher fasting blood 
glucose (Figure 1F). As changes in blood glucose likely reflect impact on endogenous mouse organ sys￾tems and human islet grafts, we evaluated function of the grafts by measuring serum insulin levels using a 
human-specific insulin assay and normalizing these to the glucose level of the mouse. In fasted mice, SIR 
treatment did not affect human insulin or the insulin/glucose ratio, while TAC treatment decreased human 
insulin and the insulin/glucose ratio (Figure 1, G and H; individual donors, Supplemental Figure 4).
After glucose-arginine stimulation, human islets in both TAC and SIR treatment groups secreted less 
insulin compared with saline-treated animals (Figure 1, I–K; individual donors, Supplemental Figure 4). 
SIR-treated mice had both higher blood glucose and human insulin than TAC-treated mice. To assess for 
direct effects on islets, we cultured human islets in vitro with clinically relevant doses of TAC or SIR (20

RESEARCH ARTICLE
ng/mL) for 1, 24, and 48 hours and found that, after 48 hours of exposure, insulin secretion was inhibited 
at both basal (5.6 mM) and high (16.7 mM) glucose (Supplemental Figure 5). These results indicate that, 
at clinically relevant levels, both SIR and TAC directly affect human β cells in vivo by impairing insulin 
secretion in the stimulated and/or fasted state and that this could be a significant contributor to PTDM.
TAC and SIR treatment do not affect β cell proliferation or apoptosis in vivo. To investigate mechanisms under￾lying the human β cell dysfunction induced by TAC or SIR treatment, we harvested islet grafts for analysis. 
As both the calcineurin and mTOR pathway are involved in the regulation of β cell mass (11–14, 19), we 
analyzed β cell proliferation by Ki67 but found low proliferation rates (<0.5%) with no differences between 
treatment groups (Supplemental Figure 6, A and C). Likewise, we assessed for apoptosis by the TUNEL 
assay; however, apoptotic β cells in the grafts were extremely rare, with no difference between treatment 
groups (Supplemental Figure 6, B and D), indicating that neither TAC nor SIR treatment for 4 weeks at 
clinically relevant doses affect β cell proliferation or apoptosis in human islets in vivo.
TAC and SIR treatment increase amyloid formation and macrophages in human islet grafts. Amyloid deposition 
in islets, an important pathologic feature in type 2 diabetes, may be a cause or a hallmark of dysfunctional 
islets (27). Because transplanted human islets form amyloid deposits and this is exacerbated by stressors 
such as insulin resistance (21), we assessed the grafts for amyloid deposition. Interestingly, we found that

individual donors varied greatly in the degree of amyloid deposition seen and, thus, report values normal￾ized to the saline-treated control. We found that TAC or SIR treatment increased amyloid deposition in 
the transplanted human islets (Figure 2, A and B, normalized; Supplemental Table 2, nonnormalized data 
points), supporting the concept of TAC- and SIR-induced β cell dysfunction. Surprisingly, both SIR and 
TAC treatment also increased the number of CD45+ cells within the graft area (Supplemental Figure 7, A 
and B); these cells were primarily macrophages (as marked by IBA1) and of human origin (human-specific 
CD45), indicating that these are likely islet-resident macrophages (Supplemental Figure 8, A and B). Islet 
macrophages play both supportive and detrimental roles within the islet, depending on the context (28–30). 
The functional effects of TAC or SIR treatment on islet-resident macrophages have not been studied; how￾ever, there is evidence that inhibition of the mTOR or NFAT pathways can activate resident macrophages, 
as opposed to the well-characterized suppression seen in T cells (31–34). Furthermore, amyloid deposits 
can stimulate islet macrophages to produce IL-1β, which can inhibit β cell function (35, 36).
TAC and SIR treatment disrupt insulin processing and β cell granule formation and lead to broad transcriptional 
dysregulation. To assess for structural alterations in the human β cell, we analyzed the grafts by electron 
microscopy and found fewer β cell insulin granules in TAC- and SIR-treated grafts (Figure 2, C and D), 
suggesting that TAC- or SIR-induced dysfunction is related to impaired mature insulin granule formation, 
a critical process in coordinated insulin release.
To examine the transcriptional consequences of TAC or SIR treatment, we assessed by reverse transcrip￾tion PCR (RT-PCR) the expression of genes encoding key molecules involved in β cell metabolism (INS, GCK, 
SLC2A1), β cell–enriched transcription factors (PDX1, MAFA, MAFB, NKX6.1), the NFAT family (NFATC1–4), 
and mTOR signaling (MTOR, RPTOR, RPS6KB1, RPS6) (Supplemental Figure 9, A–D). There were no changes 
in any of these transcripts in TAC- or SIR-treated grafts.
To obtain a broad view of the transcriptional landscape, we then performed unbiased RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq) of the human islet grafts (Supplemental Figure 9, E and F). Gene set pathway analyses of differential 
gene expression by DAVID (37) within TAC- or SIR-treated grafts revealed enrichment of multiple gene lists 
related to 3 broad categories: extracellular matrix, ion/calcium flux, and peptide processing (Figure 2, E–G, and 
Supplemental Tables 3 and 4). Alterations in the extracellular matrix are consistent with the increased amyloid 
deposits and immune infiltration and with associated increases in inflammatory-related transcripts across both 
TAC and SIR treatment groups (Supplemental Figure 7, E and F). Dysregulation of genes related to the han￾dling of calcium and other ion flux suggests impaired signal transduction related to stimulated insulin secretion. 
Finally, alteration of genes related to key insulin processing events such as cleavage at dibasic sites and the 
formation of disulfide bonds suggests a defect in mature insulin formation. To test this, we analyzed fasting 
human proinsulin levels in TAC- and SIR-treated mice (Figure 2H). We found elevated human proinsulin/insu￾lin ratios, a marker of β cell stress and an early event in the progression of β cell dysfunction (38).
In summary, these data indicate that both TAC and SIR, at clinically relevant doses, do not affect reg￾ulation of β cell proliferation but have broad effects on human islets, including impaired insulin secretion, 
impaired insulin processing and β cell granule formation, and increased amyloid deposition.
Human β cell dysfunction reverses after 4-week withdrawal of TAC or SIR. To determine if TAC- or SIR-in￾duced β cell dysfunction is reversible, we treated mice transplanted with human islets (2 independent 
donors) with TAC or SIR for 4 weeks and then withdrew treatment and assessed β cell function (Figure 
3A). The ability to withdraw treatment and monitor islet function highlights the value of this model, as this 
would not be possible in humans treated with these agents following organ or cell transplantation. With 
4 weeks of TAC or SIR treatment, we saw impaired human graft function, as before (Figure 3, B–E; Sup￾plemental Figure 10, A–D; and Supplemental Figure 11, B, D–G). However, 4 weeks after withdrawal of 
treatment, we saw a complete normalization of both glucose handling and human β cell function in fasted 
and stimulated states (Figure 3, F–I; Supplemental Figure 10, E–H; Supplemental Figure 11, C and H–K). 
This suggests that dysfunction induced by TAC or SIR is not permanent and highlights that human β cells 
can recover normal function if such stressors are removed.
Following withdrawal of TAC or SIR, grafts were harvested and analyzed. Compared with grafts from 
the same treatment group after 4 weeks of treatment, amyloid deposition was higher in the saline-treated 
control grafts, was stable in TAC-treated grafts, and was lower in SIR-treated grafts (Figure 3, J and K). 
Thus, after 4 weeks of withdrawal from treatment, amyloid deposition in grafts was similar between all 
treatment groups. Furthermore, we found that the proportion of immune cells in TAC- and SIR-treated 
grafts was similar to saline-treated controls after the withdrawal period (Supplemental Figure 7C). Overall,

RESEARCH ARTICLE
these data indicate that these markers of islet dysfunction can normalize if the treatment is stopped and 
suggest that amyloid deposits may be cleared if islet insults are removed.
Exendin-4 treatment protects human β cells from TAC-induced dysfunction and partially ameliorates SIR-induced 
dysfunction. While it is helpful to know that the effects of TAC and SIR on human islets can be reversed 
with withdrawal, these drugs are indispensable in achieving chronic immune suppression in transplant 
patients. Thus, withdrawal of therapy is not a viable option. To assess ways to protect human islets from

drug-induced dysfunction, we cotreated mice bearing human islets from 2 independent donors with either 
TAC or SIR and Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a GLP-1R agonist (Figure 4A). GLP-1, an incretin hormone released 
by the L cells of the intestine, acts through Gs
-coupled GLP-1 receptors on β cells to activate multiple 
signaling pathways, including the calcineurin/NFAT pathway (39). This signaling acts to potentiate stimu￾lated insulin secretion and also promote young human β cell proliferation (11). GLP-1R agonists are used 
clinically in individuals with type 2 diabetes and have an excellent safety profile.

The addition of Ex-4 improved glucose handling in both TAC- and SIR-treated groups (Figure 4, B and C). 
Since GLP-1 signaling is primarily active in β cells in the setting of high glucose, we focused on stimulated graft 
function. We found that TAC + Ex-4 treatment improved stimulated human insulin and the insulin/glucose 
ratio compared with TAC treatment alone and that these reached levels comparable with islet-graft function in 
mice never receiving TAC (Figure 4, D–F). In comparison with SIR treatment alone, SIR + Ex-4 treatment led 
to a slightly improved insulin/glucose ratio (Figure 4, D–F). Taken together, this indicates that Ex-4 is able to 
completely rescue TAC-induced β cell dysfunction and partially rescue SIR-induced β cell dysfunction.
Analysis of amyloid deposition within the grafts revealed that TAC + Ex-4–treated grafts had signifi￾cantly less amyloid than TAC alone and was similar to that of control grafts (Figure 4, G and H). SIR + 
Ex-4 cotreatment showed a partial reduction in amyloid deposition compared with SIR treatment alone 
(Figure 4, G and H). Interestingly, Ex-4 cotreatment with TAC or SIR showed only mild reductions in 
numbers of CD45+ cells within the grafts (Supplemental Figure 7D). Overall, these data are consistent 
with the functional improvements and demonstrate that TAC- and SIR-induced effects on human islets and 
amyloid formation can, at least partially, be prevented.
Discussion
Understanding the effect of immunosuppressive agents on human islets would help elucidate the patho￾genesis of PTDM. To study this, we transplanted human islets into immunodeficient mice and treated the 
mice with clinically relevant levels of 2 commonly used immunosuppressive agents, TAC and SIR. Using 
this model, we identified several major molecular alterations related to this dysfunction, including reduced 
β cell granules, elevated proinsulin, and increased islet amyloid deposition, which have not been previously 
reported for β cell dysfunction related to immunosuppressive agents. Furthermore, gene pathway enrich￾ment analysis of RNA-seq data revealed that TAC- or SIR-induced broad dysregulation of peptide process￾ing, ion and calcium flux, and extracellular matrix maintenance. Together, these data provide mechanistic 
insight into TAC- and SIR-induced dysfunction as it relates to PTDM.
With this model, we also demonstrated that TAC- and SIR-induced dysfunction can be reversed with 
withdrawal of the drug and can be prevented with cotreatment with the GLP-1 agonist Ex-4; these are 
important findings with clinical implications. Ex-4 and TAC, at least in part, target similar pathways, with 
TAC inhibiting calcineurin, while GLP-1R signaling in the β cell has been shown to lead to calcineurin 
activation (11). Our data suggest that β cell activation of calcineurin through the GLP-1R can overcome 
inhibition by TAC and, thus, prevent the insulin secretory deficit, though we cannot rule out contribution 
from additional pathways. Ex-4 and SIR target different pathways, and we noted a partial improvement in 
human β cell health and function. This suggests that targeted mTOR activation in human β cells may be an 
effective approach of protecting human β cells from SIR-induced dysfunction.
This study differs from prior reports on the impact of TAC or SIR on islets (13, 14, 19) in that we studied 
human islets in vivo and used dosing regimens that achieved clinically relevant levels, thus avoiding toxici￾ty-related effects. In this setting, TAC and SIR affect human β cell function without altering β cell proliferation 
or death. This adds to a growing body of literature highlighting differences in how human islets respond in 
vivo versus in vitro, including in their ability to proliferate, differentiate, and respond to metabolic stressors 
such as hyperglycemia or dyslipidemia (21, 40–44). Thus, these results highlight that in vitro may not always 
reflect in vivo mechanisms and emphasize the value of studying human islets in a transplantation model.
Our model has a number of advantages, including allowing for studies that would not be possible in 
humans, while still being able to assess human β cells in a complex, in vivo environment. This approach 
also allows for a comprehensive assessment that takes into account both direct actions of TAC or SIR on 
the grafts, as well as indirect actions such as SIR-induced insulin resistance. While our model allowed for 
longer treatment periods than in vitro studies, transplant patients are typically on life-long immunosuppres￾sion, and some develop PTDM years after transplant. It is unclear if TAC or SIR exposure over this length 
of time would have additional effects than what we observed and whether this would be reversible. Another 
caveat to our approach is that the transplantation procedure may add stress to the islets that would not be 
present in the pancreas in situ during the development of PTDM. To minimize this, we allowed the islets 
to engraft for 2 weeks before starting drug treatment, giving the islets time to recover. Furthermore, while 
the immunosuppressed mouse is the best model to study human islets in vivo, TAC and SIR may have 
additional indirect effects on human islets by impacting the systemic immune system that are not reflected 
in our model. Finally, even though we performed all experiments with multiple independent donors, it is

possible that the genetic and epigenetic variation of human islet donors could play a role in susceptibility 
to these drugs and PTDM.
PTDM is a major complication after all solid organ and cell transplantation, but clear treatment guide￾lines for long-term management or prevention are lacking (1). Studies evaluating GLP-1–based therapies in 
PTDM are limited but indicate that short-term GLP-1 administration can improve insulin secretion (45).

Furthermore, small retrospective analyses have shown that sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor that boosts endog￾enous GLP-1 levels by preventing its breakdown, is safe and efficacious in treating PTDM (2). Our data 
provide a strong rationale for cotreatment with a GLP-1–based agonist and suggest that clinical trials might 
test whether GLP-1 agonist treatment may be beneficial in patients treated with TAC or SIR.
In summary, we highlight that TAC- or SIR-induced human islet dysfunction is both reversible with with￾drawal of treatment and, at least partially, preventable with cotreatment with a GLP-1R agonist. These studies 
highlight the importance of both calcineurin/NFAT and mTOR pathways in human β cell function and suggest 
that activation of these pathways in β cells may be a useful approach to reduce the incidence of PTDM.
Methods
Human islets and islet transplantation. Human islets (n = 11 preparations, Supplemental Table 1) were 
obtained from Integrated Islet Distribution Network (http://iidp.coh.org/), from Human Pancreas Anal￾ysis Program (https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu/), or isolated at the Institute of Cellular Therapeutics of 
the Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). Assessment of human islet function was 
performed by islet perifusion assay on the day of arrival, as previously described (20, 26). Male NSG mice 
(23), age 12–18 weeks, were used for transplantation. Human islets were transplanted under the kidney 
capsule as previously described (11, 21). Each mouse received 1500 IEQ, and islets from a given donor were 
divided evenly among all 3 treatment groups.
This study used data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The OPTN 
data system includes data on all donor, wait-listed candidates, and transplant recipients in the US, sub￾mitted by the members of the OPTN. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), US 
Department of Health and Human Services, provides oversight to the activities of the OPTN contractor. 
The data reported here have been supplied by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) as the contractor 
for the OPTN. The interpretation and reporting of these data are the responsibility of the authors and in no 
way should be seen as an official policy of or interpretation by the OPTN or the US government.
TAC, SIR, and Ex-4 administration. Two weeks after human islet transplantation, TAC (0.25 mg/kg/
day, NDC 0469-3016-01, Astellas Pharma US Inc.) or saline was delivered by micro-osmotic pumps (Alzet, 
1004) implanted in recipient NSG mice. SIR (0.2 mg/kg, NDC 0008-1030-06, Pfizer) or saline was given 
by i.p. injection every 72 hours. After 4 weeks of drug treatment, the human grafts were removed for sub￾sequent study (Figure 1C). Saline delivered via osmotic pump versus i.p. injection had no effect on glucose, 
insulin levels, morphology, or cell composition of grafts, and as such, we combined them into 1 control 
group for data analysis. Blood concentrations of TAC and SIR were measured by Vanderbilt Diagnostic 
Laboratories. Ex-4 (24 nmol/kg/day, California Peptide Research Inc.) or 1× PBS was also delivered by 
micro-osmotic pumps (Alzet, 1004) as previously described (11).
Assessment of glucose tolerance and serum insulin. I.p. GTTs were performed after a 6-hour fast, as pre￾viously described (21). For glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), the mice were fasted for 6 hours 
and then injected i.p. with glucose/arginine (2 g/kg). Blood samples were obtained before (0 minutes) and 
after (15 minutes) injection. In Ex-4 experiments, the mice were injected with Ex-4 (100 μg/kg) 30 minutes 
before GSIS. Serum human insulin levels were measured as previously described (21).
IHC of human islet grafts. Frozen human islet graft sections (5 μm thick) were cut and stained as described 
(11, 21). Primary antibodies used in this project are listed in Supplemental Table 6. Apoptosis was assessed 
by TUNEL (MilliporeSigma, S7165) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To assess amyloid deposits, 
sections from human grafts were first stained with the insulin antibody and then incubated with 0.5% con￾centration Thioflavin S (T-1892, MilliporeSigma) in PBS. Images were acquired with an Olympus BX41 
fluorescence microscope or a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Positive Ki67 or pS6 β cells and areas of 
Thioflavin S or CD45 were quantified with MetaMorph software.
Electron microscopy. Ultrastructure of β cells was studied by transmission electron microscopy (21). Human 
islet grafts were removed after perfusion and fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Samples 
were subsequently imaged on the Philips/FEI Tecnai T12 microscope at various magnifications.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from human islet grafts 
using an RNAqueous RNA isolation kit (Ambion). RNA quality control and quantity assessment (QC/
QA) was performed using Bioanalyzer instrument in the Vanderbilt Function Genomics Shared Resource 
(FGSR) core lab. cDNA was synthesized using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied 
Biosystems, 4368814) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was per-

formed using TaqMan assays and reagents from Applied Biosystems as described (11, 20, 21). Primers used 
in this project are listed in Supplemental Table 7. SYPL1, SV2A, and CHDA were used for control genes. 
Relative changes in mRNA expression were calculated by the comparative ΔCt method using Applied Bio￾systems Stepone Plus System.
RNA-seq library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis. A minimum of 500 nanograms of total RNA 
(RNA isolation as above) was used for downstream RNA-seq applications. Polyadenylated RNAs were 
isolated using NEBNext Magnetic Oligo d(T)25 Beads. The NEBNext mRNA Library Prep Reagent Set 
for Illumina (New England BioLabs Inc.) was then used to prepare individually bar-coded next-generation 
sequencing expression libraries as per manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Library concentration was 
assessed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, and the library quality was estimated by utilizing a DNA 1000 
Chip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Accurate quantification for sequencing applications was determined 
using the qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems Inc.). Paired-end 
sequencing (100 million, 100-bp, paired-end reads) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer.
Postprocessing of the sequencing reads from RNA-seq experiments for each sample was performed 
using HudsonAlpha’s in-house RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. Briefly, quality control checks on raw 
sequence data for each sample were performed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics). Raw reads 
were mapped to the reference hg19 using TopHat v2.0. The alignment metrics of the mapped reads 
were estimated using SAMtools. Aligned reads were imported to the commercial data analysis plat￾form Avadis NGS (Strand Scientifics). After quality inspection, the aligned reads were filtered on the 
basis of read quality metrics; reads with a base quality score of less than 30, alignment score of less 
than 95, and mapping quality of less than 40 were removed. Remaining reads were then filtered on the 
basis of their read statistics; missing mates, translocated, unaligned, and flipped reads were removed. 
The reads list was then filtered to remove duplicates. Samples were grouped, and transcript abundance 
was quantified for this final read list using Trimmed Means of M-values (TMM) as the normalization 
method. Output data utilized for all subsequent comparisons were summarized as normalized expres￾sion values generated by Avadis NGS. Differential expression of genes was calculated on the basis of 
fold changes (using the default cut-off of ≥ 1.5 or ≤ –1.5) observed in comparisons between defined 
conditions. DAVID v6.8 analysis was performed on the differentially expressed gene list of 1.5× fold 
change (37). This data has been deposited in the GEO repository (GSE140230; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140230)
Statistics. Statistical significance of differences was determined by 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey 
multiple comparisons tests or 1-tailed, unpaired t test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Val￾ues represent mean ± SEM. For RNA-seq analyses, P values of the differentially expressed gene list were 
estimated by z-test using Benjamini Hochberg corrections of 0.05 for FDR.
Study approval. The Vanderbilt University IRB does not classify deidentified human pancreatic speci￾mens as human subject research. All animal studies were approved by the Vanderbilt IACUC.
