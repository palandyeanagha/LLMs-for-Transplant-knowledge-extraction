Abstract
Background: Depending on their anatomical location, different fat depots have a different capacity to produce
bioactive peptides, called adipokines. Adipokines produced by periadventitial fat have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of vascular disease, including atherosclerosis. Chemerin is an adipokine with an established role in
immunity, adipose tissue function and metabolism, acting in autocrine, paracrine and endocrine manners. We
investigated the protein expression of chemerin and its receptor, CMKLR1, in human aortas, coronary vessels and
the respective periadventitial adipose tissue and correlated their expression with the presence of atherosclerosis.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry for chemerin and CMKLR1 was performed on human aortic and coronary artery
samples including the periadventitial adipose tissue. Aortic and coronary atherosclerotic lesions were assessed using
the AHA classification.
Results: Chemerin immunopositivity was noticed in both periadventitial fat depots, in vascular smooth muscle cells
and foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Periadventitial fat and foam cell chemerin immunopositivity was statistically
significantly correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis in both locations. CMKLR1 was expressed in vascular smooth
muscle cells and foam cells in aortic and coronary vessels with atherosclerotic lesions. CMKLR1 immunostaining in
foam cells was statistically significantly correlated with aortic atherosclerosis.
Conclusions: Our results lend some support to a presumable role of locally produced chemerin in the progression
of atherosclerotic lesions, possibly acting through its CMKLR1 receptor. Further research will elucidate the role of
chemerin signaling in atherosclerosis.

Background
Adipose tissue has long been considered as a quiescent
organ, offering insulation from the exterior and serving as
a passive energy depot [1,2]. However during the past two
decades this role has been reviewed, as it was revealed that
adipose tissue is an active source of a considerable amount
of peptides, called adipokines [1,2]. These substances,
acting in an autocrine, paracrine and endocrine manner,
have been shown to regulate several body functions and to
be implicated in the pathogenesis of clinical entities, such
as the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis [1,2].
Periadventitial adipose tissue, “tunica adiposa” as pro￾posed [3], constitutes a unique fat depot which is no more
considered an innocent bystander, as its role in vascular
physiology and pathology through adipokine secretion is
now well established [3,4]. Its close vicinity to the vascular
wall seems to be of extreme importance, allowing
bioactive molecules produced by perivascular fat to easily
diffuse into the vascular wall and interact with mural cells,
such as vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells,
exerting physiological responses [5,6]. In cases where the
vascular wall thickness exceeds the limit for passive
diffusion, for instance in sites of inflammation and athero￾sclerotic plaque formation, the hypothesis of the so-called
“vasocrine signaling” seems to explain the most possible
pathway through which adipokines can reach their targets

in deeper vascular wall layers [7]. According to this hypoth￾esis, substances produced near adventitial vasa vasorum
can traverse them and be delivered to the intima, so that
downstream transport of all adipokines released from peri￾adventitial adipose tissue directly into the arterial wall be￾comes feasible. In this respect, several adipokines, especially
produced by pericoronary epicardial adipose tissue or else￾where in direct proximity to the vascular wall have been in￾vestigated and linked to atherosclerosis, either as promoters
or as decelerators of the atherosclerotic process [8-10].
Chemerin is a chemoattractant protein, natural ligand
of the G-protein coupled receptor CMKLR1, found in
abundancy in human inflammatory fluids [11]. Chemerin
has been identified as an adipokine that relates to metabolic
syndrome [12-14]. CMKLR1 (also known as ChemR23) is
currently the only chemerin receptor (the other two being
CCRL2 and GPR1) with clearly described biological actions
[14]. Chemerin’s expression in inflamed tissues and its
ability for chemotactic recruitment of macrophages and
other antigen presenting cells expressing CMKLR1 recep￾tor, as well as the proposed pro- and anti-inflammatory
properties of chemerin, suggest a role of this adipokine in
inflammatory states and possibly atherosclerosis [14].
Although several aspects of chemerin’s biological functions
concerning the cardiovascular system have been investi￾gated [15-17], the contribution of local chemerin expres￾sion by perivascular adipose tissue and its interaction with
CMKLR1 expressed in the vasculature to the regulation of
vascular function is relatively understudied. Therefore, the
role of chemerin/CMKLR1 system in vascular inflamma￾tion and atherosclerosis is far from clearly elucidated.
We hereby report our results concerning chemerin
and CMKLR1 expression in human periaortic abdominal
and pericoronary adipose tissue and the adjacent arterial
wall. We also report our results concerning associations
among the expression of chemerin and its receptor and
aortic and coronary atherosclerosis, as well as other
clinical parameters.
Methods
Tissue specimens
The study has been approved by the Committee on Re￾search and Ethics and the Scientific Committee of the
University Hospital of Patras, Greece. Cross-sections of
human left coronary arteries (n=40) and abdominal aortas
prior to bifurcation into common iliac arteries (n=40), in￾cluding the periadventitial fat, were obtained from 40 aut￾opsy cases. According to autopsy records, the mean age
was 44.5 years (range 14–81 years), the mean Body Mass
Index (BMI) was 26.74 kg/m2 (range 17.57-32.65 kg/m2
),
20/40 were hypertensives and 10/40 died of an acute cor￾onary occlusion. The specimens were fixed by immersion
in neutrally buffered 10% formalin, dehydrated and rou￾tinely processed in paraffin embedding.
Immunohistochemical staining procedure
Consecutive 4 μm sections of aortic and coronary tissue
samples were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in
graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched by treatment with 1% hydrogen peroxide for
20 min, followed by incubation with appropriate protein
blocking solution (3% Bovine Serum Albumin/Tris Buffered
Saline). Sections were subsequently incubated overnight in
4°C with rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies (1:1000 anti￾Chemerin, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA, USA
and 1:400 anti-CMKLR1, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).
The Envision Plus Detection System kit (DakoCytomation,
USA) was used for visualization of bound primary antibody,
with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a chromogen (which
yielded brown reaction products). Sections were counter￾stained with Harris’ hematoxylin solution, dehydrated and
mounted. For each antiserum negative controls were per￾formed by replacing the primary antibody with protein
blocking solution.
Histopathological evaluation
The presence of periadventitial adipose tissue and the in￾tegrity of the vascular wall were confirmed. Atherosclerotic
lesions were assessed according to AHA classification [18]
and ranked for statistical reasons in 4 groups: 1: absence of
atherosclerotic lesions, 2: AHA type I and II lesions, 3:
AHA type III and IV lesions, 4: AHA type Va-c and VI
lesions.
Immunohistological evaluation
All slides were assessed by two pathologists (H.P., J.V.) and
two investigators (C.K., S.S.) independently and blinded to
the case. Immunoreactivity was graded on a scale of 0–3
according to intensity of cytoplasmic or membrane stain￾ing and percentage of immunopositive cells: 0: no staining
or <10% positive cells, 1: weak staining in 10-70% positive
cells or moderate staining in 10-35% positive cells, 2: weak
staining in >70% positive cells or moderate staining in 35-
70% positive cells or strong staining in 10-35% positive
cells, 3: moderate staining in >70% positive cells or strong
staining in >35% positive cells. Microphotographs were
obtained using a Nikon DXM 1200C digital camera
mounted on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and ACT-1C
software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics
18.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Correlations between
expression of proteins, as well as their association with
atherosclerosis and age group were evaluated by the
Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient. Partial
correlation analysis was performed to remove the effect of
age and BMI on correlations between protein expression
and atherosclerosis. Ordinal data were assessed with non￾Kostopoulos et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2014, 14:56 Page 2 of 9

parametric tests. Significance of protein expression differ￾ences between groups with distinct clinical parameters
were analysed with Mann–Whitney test. To examine
differences in protein expression between depots of
the same cases Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used.
The significance level was defined as p < 0.05.
Results
Evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions
Atherosclerotic lesions ranging from isolated suben￾dothelial macrophages to complicated fibroatheromata
were detected in 34/40(85%) aortic tissue and 37/40
(92.5%) coronary tissue samples (Tables 1 and 2).
Chemerin and CMKLR1 expression in periaortic adipose
tissue, aortic vascular smooth muscle cells and foam cells
in aortic atherosclerotic lesions
Chemerin expression was detected in adipocytes and
stromal-vascular cells in 37/40(92.5%) periaortic adipose
tissue samples (Table 1, Figure 1a). Chemerin expression
was also detected in vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs) of the tunica media in 40/40(100%) aortic
samples (Figure 1a) and in foam cells of atherosclerotic le￾sions in 27/34(79.4%) aortic samples (Figure 1c).
CMKLR1 was not expressed in periaortic adipose tissue.
CMKLR1 immunoreactivity was detected in VSMCs in
10/40(25%) aortic samples (Figure 1e), while foam cells in
aortic atherosclerotic lesions were immunopositive for
CMKLR1 in 30/34(88.2%) cases (Figure 1g).
Chemerin expression in periaortic fat was positively
correlated with aortic VSMC (r=0.562, p < 0.001) and
foam cell chemerin expression (r=0.725, p < 0.001), while
aortic VSMC chemerin expression was also positively
correlated with aortic foam cell chemerin expression
(r=0.493, p=0.003). Another statistically significant positive
correlation was noted between chemerin and CMKLR1 ex￾pression (r=0.494, p=0.003) in foam cells of aortic athero￾sclerotic lesions.

tissue samples (Table 2, Figure 1b). Chemerin expression
was also detected in vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs) of the tunica media in 40/40(100%) coronary ar￾tery samples (Figure 1b,d) and in foam cells of atheroscler￾otic lesions in 34/37(91.9%) coronary samples (Figure 1d).
CMKLR1 was not expressed in pericoronary adipose tis￾sue. CMKLR1 immunoreactivity was detected in VSMCs
in 15/40(37.5%) coronary samples (Figure 1f ), while foam
cells in coronary atherosclerotic lesions were immunopo￾sitive for CMKLR1 in 24/37(64.9%) cases (Figure 1h).
Chemerin expression in pericoronary fat was positively
correlated with coronary VSMC (r=0.331, p=0.037) and
foam cell chemerin expression (r=0.533, p=0.001). A sta￾tistically significant positive correlation was also noted
between chemerin and CMKLR1 expression (r=0.336,
p=0.042) in foam cells of coronary atherosclerotic lesions.
Interestingly, there were statistically significant differ￾ences in protein expression between aortic and coronary
samples. In this respect, chemerin and CMKLR1 expres￾sion was higher in foam cells of aortic atherosclerotic
lesions compared to foam cells of coronary lesions
(p=0.024 and p=0.05, respectively), while CMKLR1
expression alone was higher in coronary than in aortic
VSMCs (p=0.035).
Chemerin and CMKLR1 expression in association with
atherosclerosis
Several correlations were observed between chemerin
and CMKLR1 expression in aortic samples and the se￾verity of aortic atherosclerosis (Table 1). Periaortic fat
chemerin expression was positively correlated with ath￾erosclerosis (r=0.824, p < 0.001) and so was aortic VSMC
(r=0.626, p < 0.001) and foam cell (r=0.670, p < 0.001)
chemerin expression. A positive correlation was also
noticed between foam cell CMKLR1 expression and
aortic atherosclerosis (r=0.424, p=0.012). Adjusting for
age, partial correlations between chemerin expression
in periaortic fat (ρ=0.672, p < 0.001), aortic VSMCs
(ρ=0.527, p=0.002) and foam cells (ρ=0.610, p < 0.001)
and aortic atherosclerosis were still present. When con￾trolling for BMI, partial correlations between periaortic
fat chemerin (ρ=0.793, p < 0.001), aortic VSMC che￾merin (ρ=0.587, p < 0.001), aortic foam cell chemerin
(ρ=0.711, p < 0.001) and aortic foam cell CMKLR1

(ρ=0.434, p=0.012) expression and aortic atherosclerosis
remained strong.
Coronary atherosclerosis was also correlated with che￾merin and CMKLR1 expression in coronary samples
(Table 2). Pericoronary fat chemerin expression was posi￾tively correlated with coronary atherosclerosis (r=0.333,
p=0.036) and so was coronary foam cell chemerin expres￾sion (r=0.405, p=0.013). These correlations remained strong
when adjusting for age (ρ=0.407, p=0.014 and ρ=0.377,
p=0.023, respectively) and BMI (ρ=0.385, p=0.02 and
ρ=0.410, p=0.013, respectively). A marginally non signifi￾cant correlation was observed between coronary foam cell
CMKLR1 expression and coronary atherosclerosis (r=0.317,
p=0.056) and remained non significant when controlling
for age (ρ=0.290, p=0.086) and BMI (ρ=0,328, p=0.051).
Interestingly, coronary atherosclerosis was positively
correlated with periaortic fat and aortic VSMC chemerin
expression (r=0.438, p=0.005 and r=0.406, p=0.009,
respectively).
Expression of chemerin and CMKLR1 in association with
age and clinical parameters
Dividing the cases in age groups with 20-year intervals,
statistically significant correlations were noticed between
protein expression and age groups (Table 3). Periaortic fat
chemerin expression was increasing with age (r=0.664,
p < 0.001) and so was aortic VSMC chemerin expression
(r=0.430, p=0.006). Chemerin and CMKLR1 expression in
foam cells of aortic atherosclerotic lesions was also in￾creasing with age (r=0.554, p=0.001 and r=0.433, p=0.01,
respectively). No correlations were observed between pro￾tein expression and age group in the case of coronary
samples.
Clinical parameters, namely hypertension and acute
coronary occlusion were also associated with chemerin
expression (Table 4). Statistically significant higher ex￾pression of chemerin (p=0.044) in periaortic fat was
observed in cases with hypertension, compared with
normotensive cases. Interestingly, increased chemerin

expression in VSMCs of aortic media was also noted in
hypertensives (p=0.021). Finally, significantly increased
foam cell chemerin expression in coronary lesions
was detected in cases with acute coronary occlusion
(p=0.018).
Discussion
Since our previous report of chemerin – among other adi￾pokines – expression in periadventitial adipose tissue and
its correlation with atherosclerosis [19], a growing amount
of evidence about chemerin and its possible role in vascu￾lar inflammation and atherosclerosis have come to our
knowledge [15-17,20]. However, the exact mechanisms of
action and the role of chemerin and its receptors yet re￾main unclarified, as remains the contribution of locally
produced chemerin and its receptors within atheroscler￾otic vessels. Hence, in this study we sought to find the
existing, if any, correlations between chemerin and
CMKLR1 local expression in periadventitial adipose tissue
and the related vascular wall and the extent of atheroscler￾otic lesions in aortic and coronary tissue samples.
We found chemerin to be expressed in adipocytes and
perivascular adipose tissue stromal-vascular cells, as well
as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the aortic
and coronary arterial wall. Moreover, significant chemerin
immunostaining was observed among foam cells in
atherosclerotic lesions. Chemerin has been previously
reported to be expressed by these cell types [12-14,16,19],
thus our findings merely confirmed this observation.
CMKLR1 expression by foam cells in atherosclerotic
lesions is an expected finding as its expression by macro￾phages is well known [11,21]. VSMC expression of
CMKLR1 was also not surprising as it has been previously
been reported to take part in VSMC phenotype modula￾tion and has been linked to peripheral atherosclerosis
[22]. In our material, CMKLR1 was not found to be
expressed by mature adipocytes, such as those present in
periadventitial adipose tissue. At this point it is of some
interest to note that neither chemerin nor CMKLR1
showed any significant endothelial immunostaining in our
study, unlike other investigators’ reports [13,23]. However,
taken altogether, these findings reveal a significant presence
of chemerin/CMKLR1 signaling axis in the inflammatory
atherosclerotic milieu.
The expression pattern of chemerin throughout the
vascular wall in both sites in our study suggests that a
possible coordination mechanism may exist, as all cell
types seem to contribute proportionally in chemerin

production. In explanation, both in aortas and in coron￾ary arteries there is a strong correlation among chemerin
expression in perivascular adipocytes, VSMCs and foam
cells. Along with the fact that chemerin expression in
foam cells seems to be correlated with their CMKLR1
expression, it is quite clear that there might be a role for
chemerin as a regulator of macrophage action in sites of
vascular inflammation. This observation comes in con￾cordance with a previous investigation [21] reporting
chemerin’s ability to promote macrophage adhesion to
extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion molecules
through CMKLR1 signaling and suggesting a novel role
for chemerin in the recruitment and retention of macro￾phages at sites of inflammation.
Several correlations between chemerin/CMKLR1 ex￾pression in our material and atherosclerosis were noted.
Atherosclerosis severity was positively correlated with
perivascular adipocyte and foam cell chemerin expression
in both sites under investigation, namely aortas and cor￾onary arteries. VSMC chemerin was positively correlated
with atherosclerosis only in aortic lesions, while foam cell
CMKLR1 expression was strongly positively correlated
with aortic atherosclerosis, but only marginally with
coronary atherosclerosis. Moreover, most correlations
remained strong even after adjusting for age and BMI.
Overall, our findings suggest a role for local chemerin
production in the atherosclerotic process, as previously
described [19], involving its CMKLR1 receptor. However,
this role may be subject to interactions with other cellular
components within the vascular wall, as well as other
receptors and ligands [14,22,24], rendering the full under￾standing of chemerin/CMKLR1 axis function even more
complex. For instance, resolvin E1 is an endogenous lipid
mediator found to mediate resolution of inflammation
through leucotriene B4 receptor BLT1 and CMKLR1 acti￾vation [22,24], exerting anti-inflammatory actions via the
same receptor as chemerin. Thus, CMKLR1 may possibly
act as a receptor for both pro-inflammatory and anti￾inflammatory signals in diseased vessels. In addition,
CMKLR1 presence in VSMCs seems to promote the qui￾escent, contractile phenotype when activated by resolvin
E1 [22], however little is known about chemerin-induced
CMKLR1 activation in VSMCs, which may promote an
opposite phenotypic switch, resulting in migration, prolif￾eration and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Finally,
the effects of chemerin itself on macrophages/foam cells
and endothelial cells is far from elucidated, as conflicting
evidence about its possible pro- or anti-inflammatory and
atherogenic role have been emerging [14,21,23,25-27].
Nevertheless, co-localization of chemerin and CMKLR1 in
large amounts in foam cells of severe atherosclerotic
lesions suggests a putative role for this signaling axis in

macrophage recruitment and foam cell formation in
human atherosclerotic lesions.
Interestingly, high serum concentrations of chemerin in
several studies appear consistently associated with human
vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, especially coron￾ary artery disease [15,17,28]. In this respect, our observation
that coronary atherosclerosis severity was positively corre￾lated with periaortic adipose tissue and aortic VSMC che￾merin expression might reflect the significant contribution
of visceral fat (a special compartment of which is abdom￾inal perivascular adipose tissue) in circulating chemerin
levels, which in turn activate the constitutively expressed
CMKLR1 in macrophages and possibly other vascular cell
types, leading in acceleration of the atherosclerotic process.
It may be of some interest to note the positive correl￾ation of periaortic fat, aortic VSMC and aortic foam cell
chemerin expression, as well as aortic foam cell CMKLR1
expression with age, whereas there was no such correl￾ation in the instance of coronary samples. This finding,
which is in agreement with previous reports regarding
serum chemerin levels [13], may suggest an effect of sen￾escence on chemerin expression, although in a different
manner in separate locations, but this is yet to be con￾firmed by future investigation.
In the present study, we also demonstrated an in￾creased chemerin expression in periaortic adipose tissue
and aortic VSMCs in hypertensive cases rather than in
normotensive. There have been reports, since the identi￾fication of chemerin as an adipokine, about its close as￾sociation with the metabolic syndrome and related co￾morbidities [13,15,20,29]. As a basic constituent of the
metabolic syndrome, arterial hypertension has been
linked to high serum chemerin levels in most of these
studies [13,20,30]. Thus, our results agree with a poten￾tial role for chemerin in blood pressure regulation, in
the context of metabolic syndrome.
A last, but of some importance, finding in this study
was a correlation between foam cell chemerin in coron￾ary lesions with acute coronary occlusion as a cause of
death in our cases. As already discussed, whether high
serum chemerin levels promote atherosclerosis, espe￾cially coronary artery disease, is still in debate [30], with
growing recent data from human studies confirming this
theory [15,28]. Moreover, although new research results
support a possible protective role for chemerin/CMKLR1
[26], there is a large amount of evidence sustaining a pro￾inflammatory role for chemerin [17,21,23,25]. To be more
specific, there is a well established role for chemerin in
CMKLR1-positive macrophage recruitment and retention
in sites of inflammation, through enhanced adhesion to
extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules [21], while a
potential angiogenic and gelatinolytic (through MMP-2
and MMP-9 induction) influence on endothelial cells has
been reported for chemerin [23]. Chemerin has also been
demonstrated to affect adhesion molecule (ICAM, E￾selectin) expression by endothelial cells [17], while a sup￾posed direct anti-inflammatory role of chemerin through
CMKLR1 on human macrophages was ruled out in a
recent ex-vivo study [25]. Moreover, recent findings in an
animal model suggest that chemerin reduces nitric oxide
(NO) production, enhances NO breakdown and also
decreases NO-dependent cGMP signalling, thereby indu￾cing vascular dysfunction [31]. Taken altogether, these
facts support a potential role for chemerin in atheroscler￾otic plaque progression and destabilization. Acting via
CMKLR1 activation, but not exclusively, chemerin may
contribute in lipid core enlargement, fibrous cap thinning
and erosion, thus leading in plaque rupture and acute
coronary events, in case of coronary lesions.
Conclusions
In this study we demonstrate the expression of chemerin
and its CMKLR1 receptor in human aortas and coronary
arteries with varied severity of atherosclerotic lesions in
situ. The observed correlations between protein expres￾sion and atherosclerosis lend some support to the hypoth￾esis that local chemerin expression within the diseased
vascular wall, acting through its CMKLR1 receptor may
trigger complex cell-cell interactions, contributing – most
probably – in atheromatous plaque progression. However,
ruling out the effects of other CMKLR1 ligands, such as
lipid mediator resolvin E1, as well as other chemerin
receptors, such as CCRL2, seems to be the challenge, so
as to better understand the chemerin/CMKLR1 signaling
axis. Extended investigation, integrating ex vivo experi￾mental methodology, in vivo research on animal models
of atherosclerosis (expressing chemerin/CMKLR1 and
silenced for one or both of these proteins) and – ideally –
translational research in humans would clarify the role of
this regulating system. Chemerin and CMKLR1, as already
discussed, seem to play a pivotal role in vascular inflam￾mation and atherogenesis. Local chemerin production by
several components of the vascular wall may be of distin￾guishing importance, due to the proximity to lesions and
may also have varying effects, depending on local interac￾tions. Further research will elucidate the role of chemerin
signaling in atherosclerosis.
