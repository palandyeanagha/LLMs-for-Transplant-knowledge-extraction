Abstract
Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) modulate the immune
response and reduce lung injury in animal models. Currently, no clinical studies of the effects of MSCs in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) exist. The objectives of this study were first to examine the possible adverse
events after systemic administration of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs in ARDS patients and second to determine
potential efficacy of MSCs on ARDS.
Methods: Twelve adult patients meeting the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome with a
PaO2/FiO2 ratio of < 200 were randomized to receive allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs or placebo in a 1:1 fashion.
Patients received one intravenous dose of 1 × 106 cells/kg of body weight or saline. Possible side effects were
monitored after treatment. Acute lung injury biomarkers, including IL-6, IL-8 and surfactant protein D (SP-D), were
examined to determine the effects of MSCs on lung injury and inflammation.
Results: There were no infusion toxicities or serious adverse events related to MSCs administration and there were
no significant differences in the overall number of adverse events between the two groups. Length of hospital stay,
ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day 28 after treatment were similar. There were no changes in biomarkers
examined in the placebo group. In the MSCs group, serum SP-D levels at day 5 were significantly lower than those
at day 0 (p = 0.027) while the changes in IL-8 levels were not significant. The IL-6 levels at day 5 showed a trend
towards lower levels as compared with day 0, but this trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.06).
Conclusions: Administration of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs appears to be safe and feasible in the treatment
of ARDS. However, the clinical effect with the doses of MSCs used is weak, and further optimization of this strategy
will probably be required to reach the goal of reduced alveolar epithelial injury in ARDS.

Introduction
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major
cause of acute respiratory failure and is often associated
with multiple organ failure. Clinical disorders such as
pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, and
major trauma can precipitate ARDS. The pathogenesis
of ARDS involves lung endothelial injury, alveolar
epithelial injury, and the accumulation of protein-rich
fluid and cellular debris in the alveolar space [1]. Even
with the current advances in lung-protective ventilation
and fluid management, patient mortality rate remains
high. A clinical diagnosis of ARDS is associated with
large financial burdens due to long hospitalization and
ICU stays, a poor survival rate, and an increased use of
health services after hospital discharge. Most patients
who survive an episode of ARDS will sustain some
degree of permanent physical disability as well as reduction
in their quality of life. In addition, survivors often
have long-term neuromuscular, cognitive, and psychological
symptoms [2]. To decrease the occurrence of these
life-changing consequences, alternative therapeutic options
are needed that can reduce lung injury while facilitating
and enhancing lung repair.
In the past decade, the preclinical and clinical studies
of MSCs have boosted the expectations of both patients
and physicians for MSCs as a treatment modality. Unlike
embryonic stem cells, the procurement and use of MSCs
is less controversial. There are multiple mechanisms
responsible for the protective effects of MSCs, including
the secretion of multiple paracrine factors capable of
modulating the immune response and restoring epithelial
and endothelial integrity [3]. Moreover, their immuno￾modulatory capacity, coupled with low immunogenicity,
have opened up possibilities for their allogeneic use,
consequently broadening the possibilities for their
application. Allogeneic MSCs have been applied to
treat graft-versus-host diseases [4], myocardial infarction
[5], autoimmune diseases [6], and inflammatory bowel
diseases [7]. In May 2012, Canadian health regulators
approved ProchymalTM, the first allogeneic MSCs-based
drug, for acute graft-versus-host diseases in children
who have failed to respond to steroid treatment. Bone
marrow (BM)-MSCs are the most widely used MSCs
in clinical trials. Unfortunately, the harvest of BM is
a highly invasive procedure. Furthermore, the number,
differentiation potential, and maximal life span of
MSCs from BM decline with increasing age [8,9]. Due
to their ease of procurement and cell banking, the
adipose-derived MSCs have received significant attention
over the past few years [10].
Many studies, including publications from our group
[11,12], have demonstrated compelling evidence of the
benefits of MSCs from both bone marrow [13-15]
and adipose tissues [16-18] in animal models for lung
injury and ARDS. We hypothesized that allogeneic
adipose-derived MSCs serve as a potential therapeutic
agent for the treatment of ARDS. In this randomized,
placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial, the primary
goal was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of systemic
administration of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs in
ARDS patients. Secondary goals were to determine
potential efficacy and the effect of MSCs on biomarkers
for ARDS.
Materials and methods
Patient enrollment
This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, and
placebo-controlled study. The study protocol complied
with the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by
the Research Ethics Committee at Shaoxing Second
Hospital (Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT01902082).
Written informed consent was obtained from the patient
or legally authorized representative before enrolling each
patient. Study enrollment occurred between January and
April 2013. ARDS was defined and classified according
to the Berlin definition [19]. In the new Berlin definition,
diagnostic criteria for ARDS rely on 4 categories: (1)
timing: within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new
or worsening respiratory symptoms; (2) radiography:
bilateral opacities – not fully explained by effusions,
lobar/lung collapse or nodule; (3) origin of lung edema:
respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure
or fluid overload, and (4) oxygenation impairment:
subdivided into 3 categories according to the degree
of hypoxemia severity (mild, moderate and severe).
The Berlin definition eliminated the concept of acute
lung injury, which now falls in the category of mild
ARDS. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age
and diagnosed within 48 hours with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio
of < 200. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing severe
disease of any major organs, pregnancy, pulmonary hyper￾tension, malignant disease, human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection or if informed consent could not be
obtained.
Study design and treatment
Patients were randomized upon study enrollment. For
all patients, a negative fluid balance was maintained by
diuretics and fluid restriction. ARDS Network low tidal
volume protocol was adopted for standardized ventilator
management, targeting a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg of the
patient’s ideal body weight and a plateau pressure less
than 30 mmHg [20]. Per the requirement of Research
Ethics Committee at Shaoxing Second Hospital, frozen
MSCs with DMSO and fetal bovine serum were not
allowed to be infused to patients directly. For the MSCs
group, frozen cells were immediately thawed, cultured
with patient’s own serum and harvested in 24-48 hours.

Freshly harvested MSCs, at a dose of 1 × 106 cells/kg
body weight, were suspended in 100 ml normal saline
for peripheral intravenous infusion and administered
over 1 hour within 48 hours of enrollment. For the
placebo group, a bag of 100 ml normal saline was infused
at similar time point. After administration of the MSCs or
placebo at day 0, patients were assessed daily at days 1, 3,
5, 7, 14, and 28 (or until hospital discharge or death,
whichever occurred first). Patients who were discharged
from the hospital before day 28 were asked to return to
the study site for assessment. All other aspects of the
therapeutic management of the patients were left to the
discretion of the clinical team. The primary endpoint was
the occurrence of adverse events. Secondary efficacy
endpoints included the following: PaO2/FiO2 ratio,
hospital indices (length of hospital stay, ventilator-free
days and ICU-free days at day 28), and serum biomarkers
of ARDS including IL-6, IL-8 and SP-D.
MSCs expansion
Normal human adipose-derived MSCs were purchased
from ATCC (Cat # PCS-500-011, LOT 59753760,
passage 2, Manassas, VA). The donor of the MSCs was a
23 year-old female of Hispanic origin. MSCs were
certified to be negative for HIV, HBV, HCV, bacteria,
yeast and mycoplasma. After purchase, sterility, viral,
and endotoxin tests of the MSCs were performed at the
pathology lab of Shaoxing Second Hospital to confirm
the certificate of analysis. Cells were then resuspended
in expansion media containing Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) -low glucose supplemented
with penicillin and streptomycin and 2% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (life technologies, Grand Island, NY) plus
EGF and FGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at a
density of 4000 cells/cm2
. Cultures were maintained at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in
150 mm dishes (life technologies, Grand Island, NY).
When the cultures reached near confluence (>80%), the
cells were detached by treatment with trypsin/EDTA
and replated at a density of 4000 cells/cm2
. MSCs were
passaged up to a maximum of four times. After suffi￾cient MSCs were expanded, cells were harvested and
cryopreserved in 70% culture media, 20% fetal bovine
serum and 10% DMSO. Sterility, viral, and endotoxin
tests were carried out again after the expansion. Right
after each enrollment, 50 ml of peripheral blood was
collected and serum harvested from the patients. If a
patient was randomized to MSCs treatment, cryopreserved
MSCs were immediately thawed, washed with phosphate￾buffered saline (PBS), and cultured with the same
expansion media above except supplemented with 2%
of the patient’s own serum at a density of 15000 cells/cm2
for 24-48 hours. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA
and quantitated with a hemocytometer. Viral and endotoxin
tests were performed prior to the infusion. All cell culture
procedures were carried out in good manufacturing practice
(GMP) conditions by personnel who had received formal
training in GMP within a facility with highly controlled
temperature, room air, pressure, etc.
Characterization of MSC products
Morphology was monitored twice a week throughout the
culture period by light microscopy. Immunophenotyping
of cultured MSCs was performed using flow cytometry.
The following markers were analyzed: CD73, CD90,
CD105, CD34, CD45, and human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-DR (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey).
The samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using
CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences).
For osteogenic differentiation of the expanded MSCs,
cells were further cultured with osteogenic medium
containing 10% FBS, 0.2 mM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate
and 0.01 M β-glycerophosphate in DMEM. After 2-3 weeks,
the cultures were stained for alkaline phosphatase (ALP)

activity. For adipogenic differentiation, MSCs were cultured
in adipogenic medium consisting of DMEM and 10%
FBS supplemented with 10 μg/ml Insulin, 100 nM
dexamethasone, 250 μM isobutylmethylxanthine and
200 μM indomethacin. After 2-3 weeks of differentiation,
the cultures were stained with Oil Red O.
Animal studies
Sixteen C57BL/6 male mice aged 6-8 week-old were
randomized into 4 study groups: short term MSCs
(2 days), short term placebo, long term MSCs (28 days),
and long term placebo. Animal studies were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Zhejiang University. Mice received one high dose of
intravenous infusion of 2 × 108 expanded cells/kg of
body weight or normal saline at day 0. Mice were
sacrificed at day 2 or day 28. At the sacrifice, serum
was harvested for monitoring renal function, liver
function, cardiac enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes.
Kidney, liver and lung samples were paraffin-fixed for
histopathological analysis.
Cytokine assays
Five milliliters (ml) of peripheral blood were collected
from patients immediately before MSCs or saline treat￾ment (day 0) and day 5 after treatment. Serum samples
were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 10 minutes
and stored at -70°C until assay at the end of the trial. IL-6,
IL-8 and SP-D levels were determined by commercial
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation (SD). Comparisons of continuous variables be￾tween two groups were performed by using unpaired
Student’s t-test. Comparisons within groups were
performed by using paired t-test. Differences were deemed
statistically significant at p < 0.05.

Results
Adipose-derived MSCs
Adipose-derived MSCs were spindle-shaped with a
fibroblast-like morphology and were attached to the
plate during cell culture. These characteristics were well
preserved during subculture for a total of 4 passages
before harvest. For phenotypic characterization of MSCs,
surface protein expression at the end of expansion was
examined by flow cytometry. The MSCs were positive
for CD73 (96.7%), CD90 (97.1%), and CD105 (98.3%),
but were negative for CD34 (0.75%), CD45 (1.28%), and
HLA-DR (0.73%). The expanded MSCs preserved the
abilities of osteogenesis as determined by alkaline
phosphatase staining (Figure 1A) and adipogenesis as
assayed by Oil Red O staining (Figure 1B).
Animal studies with MSCs
After administering one high dose of 2 × 108 MSCs/kg
or normal saline at day 0 via intravenous infusion, no
mouse death was observed during the 28-day study
period. There were no significant differences in liver
(alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin) and kidney
(creatinine and blood urea nitrogen) function between
the two groups on both day 2 and day 28 (Table 1).
MSCs treatment did not alter cardiac enzymes, pancreatic
enzymes and body weight (data not shown). Mice treated
with MSCs did not show any histopathological changes in
the liver, lungs, or kidneys at both day 2 (Figure 2) and
day 28 (data not shown).
Patients
A total of 25 ARDS patients were screened for enrollment
in the study. Of this number, 13 patients were not enrolled
because of the exclusion criteria or refusal to participate
the study. The study population is comprised of 6 patients
randomized to the MSCs group and 6 patients to the
placebo group. Baseline demographics with no statistically
significant differences between the study groups are
summarized in Table 2.
Adverse events
Within 48 hours of randomization, patients received one
dose of 1 × 106 cells/kg body weight or saline as a single
intravenous infusion over 60 minutes. Study drugs were
well tolerated. No adverse events were recorded during
infusions. One patient from each group presented with
diarrhea one day after study drug treatment and resolved
within 48 hours. One patient in the MSCs group developed
rash in the chest area after the infusion and resolved
spontaneously over 24 hours. During the study period,
one patient in the MSCs group died of multiple organ
failure. Deaths occurred in two patients in the placebo
group with one multiple organ failure and the other sepsis.
None of the deaths were considered to be related to
the study drugs by the clinical investigators and were
consistent with the patients’ existing disease processes. All
the remaining patients completed the 28-day follow-up
period. There were no other adverse events or serious
adverse events.
Oxygenation index and outcomes
As part of the safety and efficacy assessment, an evaluation
of the oxygenation index and patient outcomes was
conducted. Significant improvements in oxygenation index
(PaO2/FiO2) from baseline were observed in all data
points in the MSCs group. In the placebo group, there
were no significant improvements at days 5 (p = 0.05) and
7 (p = 0.05) as compared to baseline. The PaO2/FiO2 did
not differ significantly between MSCs and placebo groups
at all time points (Figure 3). Assessment of hospital indices
did not reveal significant differences in length of hospital
stay, ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day 28
between the two study groups (Table 3).
Serum ARDS biomarkers
There were no statistically significant differences in
serum SP-D, IL-6 or IL-8 levels between the MSCs and
placebo groups at both day 0 and day 5 (Table 4). In the
placebo group, SP-D, IL-6 or IL-8 levels were similar
between day 0 and day 5 (Figure 4B, D, F). These findings
are in agreement with those reported in other ARDS
studies which showed no changes in biomarkers during

the first week of ARDS development [21,22]. In the MSCs
group, serum SP-D levels at day 5 were significantly lower
than those at day 0 (p = 0.027) (Figure 4A). The IL-6 levels
at day 5 showed a trend towards lower levels as compared
with day 0, but this trend was not statistically significant
(p = 0.06) (Figure 4E). Although the mean value for
IL-8 at day 5 was much lower than that of day 0
(Table 4), the difference was not statistically significant
due to the variation of the data (p = 0.19) (Figure 4C).
Discussions
Animal studies from our research group and others
have showed that MSCs from both bone marrow
[11-15] and adipose tissues [16-18] are able to ameliorate
lung injury induced by bleomycin and lipopolysaccharide.
These studies have laid the foundation for ARDS clinical
trials with MSCs. The clinical phase I study reported
here was performed to assess the feasibility and safety
of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs in ARDS. The
safe use of MSCs was demonstrated by the absence of
clinical complications related to cell infusion and short￾term adverse events. Matthay et al. is studying the safety
of allogeneic BM-MSCs in ARDS (NCT01775774). To our
knowledge, our study documents the first clinical trial
using adipose-derived MSCs to treat ARDS.
The anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory effect of
MSCs provides a therapeutic rationale for ARDS. It has
been reported that the pathogenesis of ARDS involves
procoagulant and inflammatory mechanisms as well as
damage to the epithelial and endothelial compartments
[23]. Biomarkers that reflect inflammation (IL-6, IL-8)
[24], coagulation (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
protein C, thrombomodulin) [25], endothelial cell injury
(von Willebrand factor) [26], and epithelial cell injury
[SP-D and receptor for advanced glycosylation end
products (RAGE)] [27], have all been linked to increased
disease severity and poorer clinical outcomes in patients
with ARDS. Our results suggest that the MSCs may be
effective in decreasing epithelial cell injury as evidenced
by reduced SP-D levels at day 5 after MSCs treatment.
The levels for pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were
decreased with only marginal significance (p = 0.06) in
MSCs group. Therefore, the present data are not sufficient
to support a conclusion that MSCs exert their effects
through alleviating lung inflammation.
In the present study, MSCs were administered through
peripheral intravenous infusion. Intravenous delivery of
MSCs is especially advantageous to lung diseases. Other
studies showed that the majority of administered stem
cells were initially trapped in the lungs. Infrared imaging
revealed stem cells evenly distributed over all lung fields

[28]. Systemic administration of MSCs was recently re￾ported in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
There were no significant differences in the overall
number of adverse events, frequency of COPD exac￾erbations, or worsening of disease in MSCs-treated
patients. Pulmonary function testing and quality of life
indicators remained the same after MSCs treatment. For
patients who had elevated C-reactive protein levels at
study entry, an early significant decrease in the levels
of circulating C-reactive protein was demonstrated in
MSCs-treated group [29].
Adipogenic precursors were first isolated from human
adipose tissue by plastic adherence [30]. Adipose-derived
MSCs were identified and characterized in human fat
tissue by Zuk et al. in 2001 [31], and this led to the
recognition of adipose tissue as an alternative to BM for
MSCs. BM-MSCs reside in the bone marrow stroma in
relatively small quantities. It has been estimated that they
comprise about 0.001%–0.01% of the total marrow nucle￾ated cells [32], whereas the proportion of adipose-derived
MSCs is approximately 2% of all nucleated cells of adipose
tissue [33]. This difference is particularly relevant for
making adipose-derived MSCs more suited for clinical
applications due to their ease of accessibility.
Adipose-derived MSCs have other advantages as com￾pared with BM-MSCs. It was initially shown that both
BM-MSCs and adipose-derived MSCs exhibit immunosup￾pressive properties in vitro [34]. Adipose-derived MSCs
can be more effective suppressors of immune response.
They were significantly better than BM-MSCs in inhibiting
both the differentiation of blood monocytes into dendritic
cells as defined by CD83 expression and the expression of
co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) on the surface of
mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Adipose-derived
MSCs were more powerful than BM-MSCs at stimulating

the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 by
dendritic cells [35]. It has been demonstrated that
adipose-derived MSCs show a significantly greater
angiogenic potential compared with BM-MSCs [36], and
may be more effective in cardiovascular pathologies
associated with ischemia.
Allogeneic BM-MSCs, ProchymalTM, has been approved
in Canada and New Zealand for acute graft-versus-host
diseases in children who have failed to respond to steroid
treatment. Allogenic adipose-derived MSCs have been
tested to treat several diseases. An open-label, single￾arm clinical trial was conducted for Crohn’s disease.
Twenty-four patients were administered intralesionally
with 20 million adipose-derived MSCs in each drain￾ing fistula tract. A subsequent administration of 40
million adipose-derived MSCs was followed if fistula
closure was incomplete at week 12. No safety concerns
were revealed at 6 months follow-up. At week 24, 69.2%
of the patients showed a reduction in the number of
draining fistulas with 56.3% of the patients achieving
complete closure of the treated fistula [7]. Vanikar et al.
administered allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs along
with hematopoietic stem cells intraportally in 11 pa￾tients with insulin-dependent diabetes and followed the
patients for 7 months. Clinical parameters improved
significantly as evidenced by a decreased exogenous
insulin requirement, reduced levels of glycosylated
hemoglobin, elevated serum c-peptide levels, and re￾solved diabetic ketoacidosis events [37]. Allogenic
adipose-derived MSCs have been explored as a sal￾vage therapy of 6 patients with severe steroid-resistant
acute graft-versus-host diseases [38]. Complete response
was achieved in 5 patients, 4 of them were still alive after a
median follow-up of 40 months. All 4 survivors were in
good clinical condition and in remission of hematological
malignancy [38].
With the application of MSCs in the clinical setting, there
is no standard protocol regarding how to expand these cells
with GMP. Most existing expansion protocols use DMEM
supplemented with FBS. However, FBS is a source of
xenogeneic antigens and carries the risk of transmitting
animal viruses and prions [39]. Immunological reactions
and anti-FBS antibodies have been observed after
transplantation in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
recipients [40]. As an alternative for FBS, platelet
lysate [41], both autologous [42] and allogeneic human
serum [43], and serum-free medium have been tested for
MSCs expansion [44]. To mitigate the allergic reactions in
seriously ill ARDS patients and meet the requirements of
the Research Ethics Committee at Shaoxing Second
Hospital, MSCs were cultured in autologous human
serum for 24-48 hours after enrollment in the present
study. This delay in MSCs administration may have
reduced the effect of MSCs in ARDS.
Our pilot study is limited primarily by the small sample
size. The current sample size limits the statistical rigor
and power of our findings and, thus, our conclusions
regarding safety and efficacy. Another limitation is that
the follow-up period was only 28 days. Longer follow-up
periods are essential in evaluating the long-term effects of
the cells. Finally, our study lacked data regarding the
time–response relationship and the dose–response
relationship for MSCs. What remains unknown is
how often or how many MSCs should be administered
in ARDS.
Conclusions
Due to the small sample size, only limited effects can
be observed in this preliminary study. Nevertheless,
the findings demonstrated that infusion of allogeneic
adipose-derived MSCs was safe and there were no
significant adverse events related to the MSCs in
ARDS. The change in ARDS biomarker, SP-D, after
treatment may suggest the protective effect of MSCs.
Additional large studies with a long follow-up period
are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of
MSCs in ARDS and to establish the best strategy for
their administration, including concomitant medication
and dosage.
