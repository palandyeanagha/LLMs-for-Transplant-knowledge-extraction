The constituent polypeptides of the interleukin-17 family form six different homodimeric
cytokines (IL-17A–F) and the heterodimeric IL-17A/F. Their interactions with IL-17 receptors
A–E (IL-17RA–E) mediate host defenses while also contributing to inflammatory and auto￾immune responses. IL-17A and IL-17F both preferentially engage a receptor complex con￾taining one molecule of IL-17RA and one molecule of IL-17RC. More generally, IL-17RA
appears to be a shared receptor that pairs with other members of its family to allow signaling
of different IL-17 cytokines. Here we report crystal structures of homodimeric IL-17A and its
complex with IL-17RA. Binding to IL-17RA at one side of the IL-17A molecule induces a
conformational change in the second, symmetry-related receptor site of IL-17A. This change
favors, and is sufficient to account for, the selection of a different receptor polypeptide to
complete the cytokine-receptor complex. The structural results are supported by biophysical
studies with IL-17A variants produced by site-directed mutagenesis.

Cytokines of the interleukin-17 family promote the
maintenance of both adaptive and innate immunity1–11.
Dysregulation of their production may contribute to
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, psoriasis and asthma1,2,12–14. As such, they are attractive
targets for therapeutic interventions15–18.
The IL-17 cytokines are dimeric proteins: six homodimeric
forms are designated IL-17A through IL-17F, and heterodimeric
IL-17A/F is also known19,20. Five receptor polypeptides are
named IL-17RA through IL-17RE.
Convincing evidence shows that IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17A/F
require a heterodimeric receptor complex comprising IL-17RA
and IL-17RC for signaling19–25. More generally, IL-17RA is
shown to be a shared receptor for other IL-17 cytokines, with
different receptor chains joining it in complex with the
cytokines2,3,8,22,23,26–30. IL-17RA has high affinity for IL-17A,
B100-fold weaker affinity for IL-17F, and an intermediate
affinity for the IL-17A/F heterodimer19–22. It has much weaker
affinities for IL-17B, C, D and E2,7,8,22,26–28,31.
In keeping with the general picture of how a cytokine is
recognized by two different receptors (for example, IL-4 by IL￾4Ra and gc)32, the interaction between an IL-17 and its primary
receptor displays sufficiently high affinity to permit binding when
the cytokine at physiological concentrations can diffuse freely
relative to the membrane-bound receptor2,3,8,22,23,26–30, while a
secondary receptor can be bound with more moderate affinity
suited to an interaction that takes place in the two-dimensional
space of the membrane2,7,8,22,26,27,28,31. The intermediate
complex formed by an IL-17 and its primary receptor
determines the exact binding surface presented to the secondary
receptor. For IL-17 dimers, measured affinities indicate that this
new binding surface must disfavor binding of the primary
receptor, while creating features that favor binding of the
secondary receptor. Overall, defining the structural features of
intermediate and complete IL-17 complexes is a key to
rationalizing the specificity inherent to the system as a
whole1,11,33.
Crystal structures are available for free IL-17F21, for IL-17A in
complex with an antibody34, and for an IL-17F/IL-17RA
complex22. In all these structures, the homodimeric cytokine
displayed a cystine-knot fold with two intramolecular disulfides
similar to that of nerve growth factor35. However, the important
N-terminal region of IL-17A was disordered in the structure of
the antibody complex34, and we demonstrate in this report that
the mechanism by which the IL-17F/IL-17RA complex was
suggested to disfavor binding of a second IL-17RA22 is not
supported by new structural data presented herein. In addition, as
IL-17RC is the high affinity receptor for IL-17F20,22,25, the IL￾17F/IL-17RA complex may not be the physiologically relevant
intermediate complex of IL-17F. Nevertheless, the IL-17F/IL￾17RA structure has given the first direct insight into the mode of
binding, showing that the receptor binds the cytokine by engaging
both its polypeptide subunits at their interface. More structures of
IL-17 and detailed analysis have been needed, and we report
herein two new structures that add greater detail to our
understanding of how IL-17 and its receptors recognize each
other.
The first structure reported here is that of a free IL-17A
homodimer in which the N terminus is more completely defined
than in the previously solved antibody complex. The newly
defined elements contribute to the structural integrity of the free
homodimer. In the second structure, which is that of an IL-17A/
IL-17RA intermediate complex, it becomes apparent that through
an allosteric mechanism, conformational shifts in the same
N-terminal elements strongly disfavor binding of a second
molecule of IL-17RA. Similar allosteric effects appear to explain
why IL-17F bound to one molecule of IL-17RA exhibits much
weaker affinity for a second IL-17RA polypeptide. Supported by
mutagenesis studies, our structures also provide a structural
rationale for differences between the respective affinities of IL￾17RA for different IL-17 cytokines.
Results
Generating suitable protein reagents for crystallizations.
Purification and crystallization of IL-17A (UniProtKB accession
code Q16552) expressed in mammalian or insect cells can be
complicated by heterogeneous post-translational protein
modifications7,19,20,21,34,36. To avoid these problems, we expressed
a recombinant IL-17A that lacked the first 10 N-terminal residues
of the mature cytokine, and had two further mutations; these were
N45D, to suppress N-glycosylation at the single canonical site,
and C106S, to eliminate the free thiol group predicted to be
exposed by elimination of its disulfide partner at C10. A construct
encoding a precursor to this protein was expressed with good
yield in mammalian cells, fully processed and secreted as the
desired homodimeric product, and purified by standard methods.
In surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, its affinity
(Kd ¼ 7 nM) for IL-17RA ECD was in the same range as that of
recombinant wild-type IL-17A (Kd ¼ 1.3 nM). It crystallized
readily.
The amino-acid sequence of IL-17RA (UniProtKB accession
code Q96F46) includes seven canonical sites for N-glycosylation.
After it was found that a recombinant form of the protein
expressed in insect cells was multiply glycosylated, two of the sites
were mutated (N175D and N234D) and deglycosylation of IL￾17RA at the remaining five sites was attempted using
N-glycosidase F. LC-MS peptide mapping showed that N36 and
N211 were successfully deglycosylated, but N18, N23 and N194
resisted complete deglycosylation. Mass spectrometry of
N-glycopeptides in tryptic digests indicated that fucosylated
oligomannose-3 glycans accounted for the great majority of
sugar groups.
Deglycosylated IL-17RA double mutant had essentially the
same affinity for IL-17A as recombinant wild-type IL-17RA
(Kd ¼ 1.9 nM versus 1.3 nM), and was free of aggregation. Using
immobilized biotinylated IL-17A, only one binding event
was observed in SPR between either the wild-type or mutant IL￾17A and either wild-type or mutant IL-17RA, for concentrations
of IL-17RA up to 150 nM. The IL-17A/IL-17RA complex sample
used for crystallization ran in size-exclusion chromatography as a
complex of IL-17A homodimer bound to a single IL-17RA
molecule, even with total protein concentrations up to 9 mg ml  1.
Structure determination of IL-17A and its complex with IL￾17RA. Crystals of IL-17A diffract to 2.48 Å, and contain one IL￾17A dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined
by the molecular replacement method, and refined well without
any Ramachandran outliers (Table 1).
The IL-17A/IL-17RA complex crystals diffracted aniso￾tropically to 2.9 Å along the c* axis and 3.3 Å in the perpendicular
directions (Table 1). The IL-17A/IL-17RA complex crystal
structure was also determined by molecular replacement. The
asymmetric unit of the complex crystal contains two copies of the
IL-17A/IL-17RA 2:1 complex. In general, complex 1 (chains A, B
and C) is more ordered than complex 2 (chains D, E and F).
IL-17RA in complex 1 (chain C) can be modeled from residues
2–273 (numbering starts with the mature receptor), and residues
2–272 (chain F) are visible in the electron density in complex 2
(Supplementary Fig. S1 illustrates electron density quality). All
the predicted disulfide bonds in IL-17RA ECD can be built in
both complexes. Electron densities for the remaining glycans were

observed at N18, N23 and N194 of both IL-17RA molecules. In
the following discussion, we concentrate mostly on complex 1 for
structural analysis.
Owing to poor electron densities in some areas, the final
refined IL-17A/IL-17RA complex model has a few Ramachan￾dran outliers (Table 1). These outliers (residues 40 and 103–105
of IL-17A chains B and E) are located at the 0–1 and 3–4 loops of
IL-17A (see below for structure descriptions).
Unbound IL-17A homodimer is highly symmetric. Two IL-17A
monomers form a parallel dimer, and they are highly similar
(Fig. 1a). The root mean square deviation (rmsd) from all Ca
atom pairs in the dimer is 0.36 Å, and almost all side chains can
be superimposed very well.
Each IL-17A monomer contains a pair of anti-parallel b-sheets,
one built from strands 1 and 2 and the second from strands 3 and
4 (Fig. 1a). The overall structure adopts a cystine-knot fold35.
Consistent with the flexibility observed in the N terminus of
antibody-bound IL-17A, each constituent monomer of the
unbound IL-17A is disordered at the N terminus up to residue
18 and in the long connecting peptides 29–42. The two isolated
peptides 19–28 form anti-parallel b-strands (strands 0); each runs
parallel with strand 4 of the other monomer (Fig. 1a).
Connections between strands 0 and the rest of the molecules
are deduced from the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex structure
discussed below, and are consistent with those of the unbound
IL-17F structure. The C-terminal peptides 127–132 of IL-17A are
disordered in both monomers.
The N-terminal region of the unbound IL-17A dimer is less
compact than its C-terminal region. Except for those involving
strands 0, interchain interactions concentrate in its C-terminal
region (Fig. 1b). The C-terminal region of the IL-17A is further
rigidified by the presence of two intrachain disulfides in each
subunit (Fig. 1b). The importance of strands 0 in the structural
integrity of IL-17A dimer is supported by the failure of constructs
lacking this sequence element to express properly in mammalian
cells. Therefore, even though the N terminus of IL-17A is
certainly more flexible than the C terminus, the interactions
involving strands 0 appear to be essential contributors to
maintaining a stable molecule.

Comparison of the new structure for unbound IL-17A dimer
with that of its antibody complex finds great similarity between
the two (rmsd of 0.89 Å for 110 out of 147 pairs of Ca atoms).
However, strands 0, parts of strands 3 and 4, and loop 3–4 are
disordered in the antibody-bound IL-17A dimer (Fig. 1c). These
peptides are well defined in the new structure, and they will be
shown below to form the region that disfavors binding of a
second IL-17RA molecule. Antibody-bound IL-17A was also very
symmetric, with rmsd of 0.53 Å for all Ca atoms in the dimer.
The structural match between the unbound IL-17A and IL-17F
is better for the respective C-terminal regions than for the N
termini (rmsd of 0.66 Å for 88 out of 166 pairs of Ca atoms in the
dimer) (Fig. 1d). However, all b strands (0–4) are preserved
between IL-17A and IL-17F. The unbound IL-17F dimer is also
highly symmetric (rmsd of 0.43 Å from 110 out of 121 pairs of Ca
atoms in each monomer), but two-fold symmetry breaks down at
peptides 14–22 and 106–107, including the C17–C107 interchain
disulfide, with deviations up to 3.5 Å.
Overall structure of the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex. As reported,
the IL-17RA ECD contains two type III fibronectin domains, D1
and D222. The D1 domain of IL-17RA interacts with both chain
A and chain B of IL-17A. IL-17RA D2 interacts mainly with IL￾17A chain A (Fig. 2a).
The two IL-17A/IL-17RA complexes in the asymmetric unit
have very similar overall structures, and all the Ca atom in the
two complexes can be superimposed (rmsd value of 0.52 Å). They
are also very similar to the IL-17F/IL17RA complex (Fig. 2a), with
rmsd values of 1.1 Å and 0.89 Å when the maximum matching
distances were set at 3.5 Å and 1.9 Å, respectively, in
superimpositions (455 and 412 pairs of Ca atoms out of 469 in
total, respectively). Based on these statistics, the maximum
matching distance is set at 1.2 Å in all the following conformation
analysis and modeling, to minimize inaccuracy in transformation
matrix.
The strands 0 and loops 0–1 and 3–4 in the cytokines, and
loops A-B and D-F in IL-17RA domain D2 deviate significantly
between the IL-17A/IL-17RA and IL-17F/IL-17RA complexes
(Fig. 2a). Some of these differences are probably due to variations
in crystal contacts. For example, the 3–4 loops of both cytokine
chains in the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex are involved in crystal
contacts, but this is not the case in the IL-17F/IL-17RA complex.
The A–B and D–F loops of the IL-17RA D2 domain have
different crystal contacts between IL-17A/IL-17RA and IL-17F/
IL-17RA complexes. These deviating peptides do not locate at the
binding interface (Fig. 2a). Other discrepancies are due to the
sequence differences between IL-17A and IL-17F in strand 0 and
loop 0–1.
The IL-17RA/IL-17A complex structure was obtained using
deglycosylated IL-17RA double mutant and truncated IL-17A. In
contrast, the IL-17RA/IL-17F complex structure was obtained
from fully glycosylated IL-17RA and full-length IL-17F with an
intact interchain disulfide bond. Despite these differences, the two
complexes share high overall similarity, supporting the view that
the mutations and enzymatic deglycosylation do not disrupt IL￾17RA interactions with IL-17A. Furthermore, no potential
N-glycosylation site in any component of either the IL-17A/IL￾17RA or IL-17F/IL-17RA complexes was located at a binding
interface (Fig. 2a). The respective N termini of IL-17A and IL-17F

are mostly disordered in both complexes. The interchain disulfide
bond in IL-17F is disordered in its complex with IL-17RA.
Binding to IL-17RA induces large conformational changes in
the N-terminal region of the IL-17A dimer, but the C-terminal
parts of both chains remain conformationally fixed. Because of
these conformational changes, only 37 Ca atoms in chain A and
57 in chain B in the C-terminal half of the IL-17A dimer,
superimpose well with the unbound IL-17A dimer (rmsd 0.58 Å).
Relative to the unbound IL-17A, the entire N-terminal half of
chain A bends away from IL-17RA (Fig. 2b). In chain B, strands
1–2 bend slightly toward IL-17RA, and the 1–2 and 3–4 loops
move away from the A0
–A and F–G loops of the D1 domain,
respectively (Fig. 2b). In addition, both strands 0 move
significantly, but maintain their interchain interactions
(Fig. 2b). IL-17RA binding also displaces the loop 0–1 in chain
B of IL-17A and makes it almost completely ordered; in contrast,
this loop in chain A remains disordered (Fig. 2b).
In the IL-17RA complex, the C-terminal peptide 127–131 of
IL-17A chain A becomes ordered and forms a parallel b-sheet
with strand G of the IL-17RA D2 domain. In IL-17A chain B, this
peptide remains disordered (Fig. 2a and b).
The N-terminal regions of IL-17F also undergo major
conformational changes upon IL-17RA binding (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Because of these conformational changes, only 71 Ca
atoms in chain A and 59 in chain B (out of 104 in each chain)
superimpose well with the unbound IL-17F dimer (rmsd 0.59 Å).
Conformational changes in the receptor-bound IL-17A allow it
to avoid steric clashes with the A0
–A, C–C0 and F–G loops of the
IL-17RA D1 domain, while also forming several favorable
interactions (Fig. 2b). Loops A0
–A and F–G of IL-17RA may
not be able to change conformation easily, being rigidified by
numerous interactions within the IL-17RA molecule, including
the C26–C95 disulfide (Fig. 2a and b).
Specific interactions between IL-17A and IL-17RA. As the
global conformation of IL-17RA complex with IL-17A or IL-17F
is conserved, side chain interactions are likely to account for
differences in affinities of IL-17RA for different IL-17. Before the
complex forms, symmetrical IL-17 homodimers have two
equivalent potential IL-17RA binding sites. In contrast, the IL￾17A/F heterodimer has two non-equivalent sites. IL-17RA binds
IL-17A at one such site, interacting extensively with both
monomers to bury a total of B2220 Å2 of surface area (Fig. 3a).
Three IL-17RA-binding regions can be designated on the IL￾17A homodimer: regions i and ii, formed by the N-terminal
region and central b-strands of IL-17A, respectively, and each
contacting the IL-17RA D1 domain; and region iii, where the
C-terminal region of IL-17A contacts the IL-17RA D2 domain
(see Fig. 3a for the overview of mapping of these regions and their
detailed views. Also see Supplementary Fig. S3 for comparisons of
these binding regions between IL-17A and IL-17F). To help in

Figure 3 | Specific interactions of IL-17A with IL-17RA. (a) Overview mapping of the different regions of the complex interface onto the ribbon
representations of IL-17A and IL-17RA, and their detailed views. Regions i, ii and iii are labeled in both the overview and the detailed views. In the overview,
contacting residues in IL-17RA are colored yellow, and in IL-17A they are color coded according to sequence conservations: purple for residues conserved in
all IL-17 members, orange for residues identical between IL-17A and IL-17F, and dark blue for residues unique to IL-17A. In the zoomed-in view panels,
side chains and main chains engaged in interaction are shown in sticks and labeled. Carbon atoms of IL-17A side chains are colored according to their
extent of sequence conservations. Hydrogen bonds are shown in dashes. (b) Sequence alignment of human, mouse and rat IL-17 highlighting interacting
residues. Contacting residues in IL-17A/IL-17RA complex are color coded according to sequence conservations. Identical and conserved residues are
also marked with ‘*’ and ‘:’ at the bottom of the sequences, respectively. Most IL-17RA interacting residues in IL-17A and IL-17F, respectively, are conserved
across human, mouse and rat sequences. Strands 0–4 are indicated with empty arrows below their sequences.

understanding the sequence specificity of IL-17A/IL-17RA
interactions, the interacting residues are highlighted in a sequence
alignment of IL-17 family members (Fig. 3b).
At region i, the ends of strands 3 and 4, loop 1–2 and the
beginning of loop 0–1 in chain B of IL-17A interact with loops
A0
–A and F–G of IL-17RA (Fig. 3a). Two major polar interac￾tions, involving R101 of IL-17A and W31 of IL-17RA, are con￾served in all IL-17 cytokines at this region (Fig. 3a and b). There
is also an IL-17A- and IL-17F-specific water-mediated interaction
at this region between S64 of IL-17A (S65 of IL-17F) and K135 of
IL-17RA (Fig. 3a). An S65L mutant of IL-17F was recently
identified in patients with impaired mucocutaneous IL-17
immunity against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus5.
Region ii, the major binding interface between IL-17A and IL￾17RA, contains many specific hydrophilic interactions. Chain B
of IL-17A contributes strands 1 and 2 and the C terminus of loop
0–1, and chain A contributes its strands 3 and 4. The C–C0 loop
of the receptor D1 domain forms a majority of the interactions,
with assistance from E127 on strand F (Fig. 3a). Among the
residues at this region, D42, R55, V65 and W67 are unique to IL￾17A, and N32, S40, Q94, E95 and L116 are identical between IL￾17A and IL-17F (Fig. 3b).
Region iii is mainly formed between the C-terminal region of
IL-17A chain A and the D2 domain of IL-17RA (Fig. 3a). Among
the residues that interact with IL-17RA, Y85 and H86 are unique
to IL-17A at this site (Fig. 3b). The C-terminal peptide 127–131 in
chain A of both IL-17A and IL-17F forms a parallel b-sheet with
strand G of the receptor (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S3). The
sequence in peptide 127–131 is mostly conserved between IL-17A
and IL-17F, but is divergent in other IL-17s.
In summary, the higher affinity of IL-17RA for IL-17A
compared with IL-17F is attributable to multiple interactions
formed with the receptor that favor IL-17A over IL-17F. These
are from cytokine chain B at region ii and chain A at region iii.
When IL-17RA binds the IL-17A/F heterodimer at either of the
two sites on the cytokine, it cannot have the favorable interactions
that IL-17A homodimer achieves at both regions ii and iii,
explaining the intermediate affinity with the heterodimer.
Other interactions are common to IL-17A and IL-17F, but
cannot be made by other IL-17 cytokines. Examples (using IL￾17A numbering) are S64 at region i, E95 at region ii, and peptide
127–131 at region iii. The lack of these favorable interactions may
weaken the affinities of IL-17B-E for IL-17RA.
Mutagenesis studies of IL-17A. The structural basis for the
difference in affinity between IL-17A and IL-17F for IL-17RA
was further probed by site-directed mutagenesis. IL-17A residues
R55 and W67 at region ii and Y85 and H86 at region iii were
each independently replaced by the corresponding residues in IL￾17F, and the respective affinities for IL-17RA ECD of the four
resulting IL-17A mutants (R55V, W67V, Y85I and H86S) were
measured by SPR (Fig. 4a). Each mutation caused a 1.5–5.0-fold
increase in Kd relative to the recombinant wild-type cytokine
(Fig. 4b).
Allosteric mechanism governing receptor complex composi￾tion. In some ligand receptor complexes, binding of the first
receptor presents a different high-affinity binding site for the
second, identical receptor37. This does not happen in the case of
IL-17A and IL-17F. The puzzle here is why a second IL-17RA
cannot bind symmetrically to the IL-17A or IL-17F dimers, and
achieve the same affinity as the first IL-17RA. Possible
explanations include steric interference between two IL-17RA
molecules in such a complex22, and/or conformational allosteric
effects induced in the cytokine when it binds the first IL-17RA.

To answer this question, we modeled the binding of a second
IL-17RA molecule to the IL-17RA/IL-17A, using the two-fold
rotational symmetry that relates two IL-17A monomers (Fig. 5).
We then checked which of the two mechanisms can account for
the selection of IL-17A homodimer against the binding of a
second IL-17RA.
Contrary to the earlier report22, we saw no steric clashes
between two IL-17RA molecules (Fig. 5, top). The same modeling
exercise showed that only the C-terminal half of the IL-17A
dimer in IL-17RA complex obeys the native two-fold symmetry
(rmsd 0.46 Å for 144 Ca pairs), and the N-terminal part of the IL￾17A dimer deviates significantly (Fig. 5). This structural
asymmetry is caused by the large and different conformational
changes required in each IL-17A polypeptide for binding to IL￾17RA (Fig. 2b). Because of this structural asymmetry, region i0
(equivalent of region i for the second IL-17RA) on IL-17A is
deformed and severe steric clashes would occur there if a second
IL-17RA binds (Fig. 5, bottom).
At region i0
, the A0
–A loop of a second IL-17RA D1 would clash
with strands 3 and 4 of IL-17A chain A (Fig. 5, bottom left). Severe
steric clashes are also observed at strands 0 for a second IL-17RA
(Fig. 5, bottom right). When the first IL-17RA binds to IL-17A,
these strands can move freely to avoid steric clashes (Fig. 2b). The
same accommodation for a second IL-17RA is blocked by the first
IL-17RA molecule already bound to IL-17A (Fig. 5, bottom).
For residues that clash at region i0 (Fig. 5, bottom right), their
symmetry-related mates form region i (Fig. 3a). None of these
residues are near the glycosylation sites (Fig. 2a), and the
mutations introduced in our samples should have minimal
effects on the deformation of region i0
.
In the analysis above, only clashes involving residues in
secondary structures of the IL-17A dimer are considered
(Fig. 5). These secondary structures (strands 0, 3 and 4) should
be preserved (Supplementary Fig. S4). Clashes involving loops 1–2
and 3–4 of IL-17A chain A at region i0 (Fig. 5) might be avoidable
if they could move freely. Region ii0 and iii0 do not seem to have
any problem with the binding of a second IL-17RA.
Consideration of the published IL-17F/IL-17RA complex
structure indicates that the same allosteric mechanism also
underpins the weak affinity of this complex for a second IL￾17RA (Supplementary Fig. S2). The C-terminal half of the IL-17F
dimer (102 out of 171 pairs of Ca atoms) obeys the two-fold
symmetry (rmsd 0.51 Å), and the N-terminal half deviates
significantly. The single steric clash that appeared in the IL-17F/
IL-17RA structure report (between two H212 side chains)22 could
be due to the inclusion of non-equivalent N-terminal residues in
the IL-17F dimer in the determination of its two-fold symmetry.
Nevertheless, it could be avoided easily by repositioning the
exposed side chains.

Figure 5 | IL-17A disfavors binding of a second IL-17RA through an allosteric mechanism. Top: a modeled IL-17RA/IL-17A/IL-17RA complex. The second
IL-17RA (orange ribbons) is built from the first receptor through two-fold rotation relating the two IL-17A monomers. Superimposed with its two-fold
rotation-related copy (gray), experimentally observed receptor bound IL-17A shows significant distortions of the two-fold symmetry at the N terminus, but
remains symmetric at the C terminus. The binding regions on IL-17A for the first and the second IL-17RA are labeled i, ii, and iii, and i0
, i00 and i000 respectively.
The only close contact between receptor 1 and 2 is at the side chains of H212 (stick model), at a distance of 4.2 Å. Bottom: zoomed-in views of the clashes
between the second IL-17RA and IL-17A at region i0
. Bottom right is a more detailed view with side chains of selected clashing residues shown in sticks. Side
chains in gray indicate the optimal positions for interaction with the second IL-17RA. For simplicity, clashing residues involving loops 1–2 and 3–4 of IL-17A
are not shown, because these loops might move freely.

the differences in affinity of IL-17RA for different cytokines and
the molecular mechanism on which cytokine bound to one
molecule of receptor has such sharply diminished affinity for a
second receptor molecule of the same type.
Thirteen residues are found to differ between IL-17A and IL￾17F at their interfaces with IL-17RA (Fig. 3b), and they may
account for B100-fold higher affinity of IL-17A for the receptor
than IL-17F. In structure-guided mutagenesis studies, four single￾site mutations in IL-17A that replaced one residue with its IL-17F
equivalent all reduced the affinity of IL-17A for IL-17RA. These
four substitutions alone will account for B22-fold difference in
affinity between IL-17A and IL-17F for IL-17RA (Fig. 4b and
Supplementary Table S1). This analysis could have been further
strengthened by mutagenesis experiments demonstrating poten￾tial increase in affinity when IL-17F residues are replaced with its
IL-17A equivalents.
The observations that IL-17RA adopts a conserved conforma￾tion in IL-17A and IL-17F complexes (Fig. 2a) and that some
major IL-17RA interacting residues are identical among all IL-17
cytokines (Fig. 3b) support the view of IL-17RA as a shared
receptor for other IL-17 cytokines2,3,8,22,23,26–30. IL-17RA may
serve as a secondary receptor for IL-17B-F once these cytokines
are captured by their primary receptors on the cell surface.
Contrary to an earlier report22, an allosteric mechanism
explains well why homodimeric IL-17A and IL-17F tend to
disfavor binding of a second molecule of IL-17RA to their
respective IL-17RA complexes. It remains less clear why IL-17A
and IL-17F also select against two-fold binding of IL-17RC, but
maintain reasonable propensities to co-bind IL-17RC and IL￾17RA to form complete complexes22. The crystal structures of
complexes with IL-17RC are needed. We can speculate that an IL￾17RC complex, and more generally, other IL-17 receptor
complexes, may use similar allosteric mechanisms to select IL￾17RA over the same type of receptors.
Methods
Protein constructs and expression. For crystallization, a DNA construct of IL￾17A double mutant (N45D/C106S) was made with the first 10 residues removed
from the mature IL-17A, using standard PCR and QuikChangeII site-directed
mutant genesis kit (Stratagen, CA, USA). This truncated, double mutant IL-17A
construct was fused to a honeybee mellitin signal sequence and cloned into pCMV
vector. IL-17A constructs with further truncations (20- and 34 N-terminal residues
removed) were also made, but they did not express in HEK293 cells.
For SPR studies, constructs of the full-length wild-type IL-17A and its R55V,
W67V, Y85I and H86S single mutants were made with an N-terminal biotin
acceptor peptide tag followed by a His6 tag, using the native signal peptide for
secretion. HEK293F cells were transfected with the DNA constructs using Freestyle
Max Reagent (Invitrogen, NY, USA) according to the suggested protocols for
expression.
The ECD of IL-17RA used in this study, including the signal peptide, was cloned
into a pFastBac vector with the carboxyl terminal fused to a thrombin cleavage site
and a FLAG epitope. The DNA construct was transfected into Sf9 insect cells
(Gibco) using Cellfectin II Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the suggested pro￾tocols for expression. To facilitate crystallization of the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex, a
construct encoding N175D and N234D double mutant IL-17RA was expressed in
similar fashion from insect cells. For SPR studies, the wild-type IL-17RA ECD was
made.
Protein purification. The cultured cell media for the wild-type and IL-17A
mutants were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was filtered through
a 0.22-mm filter. Ni-NTA Superflow resin was used for batch binding overnight.
The resin was washed and then eluted with imidazole gradient in phosphate saline
buffer (PBS, pH ¼ 7.4). Fractions containing IL-17A were pooled and further
purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex75 column. Fractions
containing properly dimeric IL-17A were pooled. For crystallization, the truncated
IL-17A double mutant was concentrated to 10 mg ml  1 for crystallization using
10-kDa cutoff Vivaspin columns (GE LifeSciences, NJ, USA).
The cultured cell medium for IL-17RA ECD was collected and filtered as above.
Anti-FLAG antibody conjugate agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) resin was used
for purification. Protein was eluted with 200 mg ml  1 FLAG peptide in PBS,
dialyzed into PBS to remove FLAG peptide and then concentrated using Vivaspin
columns. The concentrated IL-17RA protein was further treated with peptide
N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs, MA, USA) at 37 C for 3 h. Deglycosylated
IL-17RA was further purified on a size-exclusion Superdex 300 column
equilibrated with PBS.
The IL-17A/IL-17RA complex used for crystallization was generated by mixing
enzymatic deglycosylated IL-17RA double mutant with slightly excess amount of
truncated IL-17A. IL-17A/IL-17RA was separated from the unbound IL-17A on a
Superdex 300 size-exclusion column equilibrated with PBS. Fractions containing
the IL-17RA-IL-17A complex were concentrated to 9 mg ml  1 for crystallization
trials.
Crystallization and structure determination. Both the unbound IL-17A and
IL-17A/IL-17RA complex were crystallized using either sitting drop or hanging
drop vapor diffusion methods. The crystallization of the unbound IL-17A was done
at 22 C. The crystallization drops were formed by mixing 1 ml of the truncated
IL-17A at 10 mg ml  1 in PBS with 1 ml of well solution of 100 mM sodium citrate
buffer, pH 5.0–6.0, 6–12% 2-propanol, and 10% w/v PEG10k. Crystals appeared in
minutes and reached full sizes overnight. These unbound IL-17A crystals were
soaked briefly in a cryo solution that consists of mother liquor plus 25% ethylene
glycol before flashed cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Crystallization of the IL-17A/IL-17RA complex was carried out at 22 or 4 C.
The complex at 9 mg ml  1 in PBS was mixed with a well solution of 0.1 M Tris
HCl, pH 7.3–8, 20–25% Sokalan CP5 (Molecular Dimensions, Newmarket, UK).
Crystals appeared overnight and grew to full size within a few days. Complex
crystals were soaked briefly in a cryosolution consisting of the mother liquor plus
30% glycerol and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Data sets for both unbound IL-17A and IL-17A/IL-17RA complex crystals were
collected at the APS IMCA 17-ID beamline (APS, Chicago, USA) and processed
with program autoPROC38 or HKL200039. Further data manipulations were
carried out using the CCP4 program suite40. Structure determination was
performed by molecular replacement with program PHASER41, using the IL-17A
model in the antibody complex and IL-17F/IL-17RA as models for the unbound
IL-17A and IL-17A/IL-17RA structures, respectively (PDB accession codes: 2VXS
and 3JVF). Structure refinements were carried out with BUSTER with the TLS
option42,43. During refinements, local structural similarity restraints were used,
which greatly minimizes bias toward enforcing similarity in areas of real structural
differences43. Manual model building was carried out with COOT44. Data
collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.
Surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were per￾formed on a ProteOn XPR36 (BioRad, Hercules, CA). To enable the experiments
with the WT and mutant IL-17A proteins, the receptor was first biotinylated by
reaction with sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin (Pierce) under stoichiometric conditions
for 30 min at room temperature. Following the reaction, the sample was desalted to
remove the excess biotin for capture. Receptor was then captured onto an NLC
sensor chip to a level of B200 RU. The running buffer for all SPR experiments was
10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% p20. The WT and mutant IL-17A proteins
used in these binding experiments were diluted in running buffer to the respective
starting concentrations and serially diluted in three-fold increments. Proteins were
loaded for 2 min over two receptor surfaces with dissociation times of 400 s.
Because of the very slow off-rate for the proteins from the receptor, the surface was
regenerated using a pulse of 3 M MgCl2 after each injection. This regeneration step
was shown to quantitatively remove IL-17A from the receptor. Proteins were run in
triplicate over the two surfaces generating six individual sets of data for analysis.
Data analysis was performed using the ProteOn analysis software. All data were fit
to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
