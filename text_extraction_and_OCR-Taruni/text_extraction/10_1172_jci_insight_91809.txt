Introduction
β-Klotho (Klb) has been identified due to its homology with the α-klotho (Kl) gene (1). In contrast to α-klotho, 
β-klotho is only found as a membrane protein and is abundantly expressed in peripheral metabolic tissues (1).
β-Klotho forms a binary complex with FGF receptor 1c (FGFR1c) and functions as an obligate core￾ceptor for FGF21 in vitro (2, 3). FGF21 is induced in the liver following nutritional stress (4). FGF21 stim￾ulates glucose uptake and lipolysis in adipose tissue (5, 6) and activates thermogenesis (7, 8), thus making it 
of significant interest as a biologic drug to treat metabolic diseases. A Klb-deficient mouse model has been 
used to assess potential residual FGF21 activity in vivo. Klb–/– mice are fully resistant to FGF21-induced 
intracellular signaling and thus do not exhibit a physiologic response to exogenous FGF21 administration 
(9), confirming the vital role of β-klotho in the FGF21 signaling machinery in vivo. Similarly, whole-body 
Klb–/– mice overexpressing Fgf21 in the liver fail to elicit FGF21 action (10). Several studies using tissue￾specific Klb–/– mice have revealed the target tissues of FGF21 action (10–13). Notably, mice with an adipose 
tissue–specific deficiency in β-klotho lose the acute insulin-sensitizing effect of FGF21 (10), whereas mice 
with a brain-specific deficiency in β-klotho lose the thermogenic effect of FGF21 (13).
β-Klotho (encoded by Klb) is the obligate coreceptor mediating FGF21 and FGF15/19 signaling. Klb–/–
mice are refractory to beneficial action of pharmacological FGF21 treatment including stimulation 
of glucose utilization and thermogenesis. Here, we investigated the energy homeostasis in 
Klb–/– mice on high-fat diet in order to better understand the consequences of abrogating both 
endogenous FGF15/19 and FGF21 signaling during caloric overload. Surprisingly, Klb–/– mice are 
resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO) owing to enhanced energy expenditure and BAT activity. 
Klb–/– mice exhibited not only an increase but also a shift in bile acid (BA) composition featured 
by activation of the classical (neutral) BA synthesis pathway at the expense of the alternative 
(acidic) pathway. High hepatic production of cholic acid (CA) results in a large excess of microbiota￾derived deoxycholic acid (DCA). DCA is specifically responsible for activating the TGR5 receptor 
that stimulates BAT thermogenic activity. In fact, combined gene deletion of Klb and Tgr5 or 
antibiotic treatment abrogating bacterial conversion of CA into DCA both abolish DIO resistance 
in Klb–/– mice. These results suggested that DIO resistance in Klb–/– mice is caused by high levels 
of DCA, signaling through the TGR5 receptor. These data also demonstrated that gut microbiota 
can regulate host thermogenesis via conversion of primary into secondary BA. Pharmacologic 
or nutritional approaches to selectively modulate BA composition may be a promising target for 
treating metabolic disorders.

β-Klotho also forms a binary complex with FGFR4 and functions as an obligate coreceptor for FGF15 
(FGF19 ortholog in humans) (14, 15). FGF15 is an ileum-derived hormone induced by eating and activa￾tion of the nuclear bile acid (BA) receptor FXR (16). Once released in the portal circulation, FGF15 binds 
to the FGFR4/β-klotho complex in the liver, and triggers a reduction in the expression of Cyp7a1, the first 
and rate-limiting enzyme of the BA synthesis pathway (16).
Under basal conditions, Klb–/– mice exhibit a small gallbladder, with an increased BA pool and elevated 
fecal BA excretion (17). Klb–/– mice are protected against gallstone formation but exhibit few changes in 
the enterohepatic circulation of BA (17). Recent data demonstrate that reexpression of Klb specifically in 
hepatocyte reverses the lipid dysregulations and normalizes BA metabolism in Klb–/– mice (18). Klb–/– mice 
exhibited a normal energy balance on standard chow diet (17, 18).
Here, we characterize the energy homeostasis resulting from a global β-klotho deficiency, under hyper￾caloric feeding conditions (i.e., high-fat diet [HFD]). Surprisingly, Klb–/– mice are resistant to diet-induced 
obesity (DIO) despite the absence of endogenous FGF21 and FGF15 signaling. A key role in this process is 
due to changes in BA composition, characterized by increased levels of the secondary BA deoxycholic acid 
(DCA), which is produced by microbiota from hepatic cholic acid (CA) and signals through the membrane 
BA receptor TGR5 in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) to enhance thermogenesis.
Results
Klb–/– mice are resistant to DIO due to increased thermogenesis. To explore whether Klb deficiency impacts the 
response to caloric overload, we studied the metabolic parameters of Klb–/– mice following 8 weeks of 
HFD. Before HFD initiation, body weights (BWs) of Klb–/– mice on a pure C57BL/6J background were 
approximately 15% lower than WT littermates at 10 weeks of age (Figure 1A, first time point). This 
reduced BW in basal conditions was similarly reported on a mixed genetic background, reflecting an 
isometric growth limitation with no change in adiposity (17, 18). Klb–/– mice gain less weight than WT 
on HFD (Figure 1A), exhibiting a massive limitation in fat mass accretion (Figure 1B). Consequently, fat 
proportion was massively reduced in the HFD-fed Klb–/– mice compared with HFD-fed WT mice (Fig￾ure 1C), resulting in significantly lower circulating leptin levels (Figure 1D). A lower epididymal white 
adipose tissue (eWAT)/BW ratio (Figure 1E) and a reduction in adipocyte hypertrophy (Figure 1F) were 
also observed in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice. Gene expression studies in epididymal, perirenal, and inguinal 
WAT revealed similar patterns of regulation within the different WAT depots (Supplemental Figure 1; 
supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.91809DS1). 
This included increased expression levels of lipase (Atgl, Hsl, and Lpl) and adiponectin (Adipoq) as well 
as decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokine transcripts (in particular Tnf). In contrast, Ucp1 mRNA 
levels were decreased in eWAT and showed a trend towards a decrease in the other WAT depots, exclud￾ing a browning process. Circulating insulin levels were significantly lower (Figure 1G) and glucose toler￾ance was ameliorated (Figure 1H) in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice, probably reflecting their decreased adiposity. 
HFD-fed Klb–/– mice have a similar daily food intake compared with WT, and even a slightly increased 
food ingestion when reported relative to their metabolic BW (Figure 1I). No change was observed in 
hypothalamic gene expression of orexigenic/anorexigenic neuropeptides or inflammatory markers (Fig￾ure 1J). Evaluation of the energy content remaining in the feces showed the trend to be lower in HFD-fed 
Klb–/– mice compared with HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 1K). Taken together, these results excluded the 
possibility that a modification in food intake or nutrient assimilation underlies the resistance to DIO. 
In contrast, we observed significantly higher consumption of O2
 (VO2
) and production of CO2
 (VCO2
) 
(during both light and dark phases) in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice (Figure 2, A, B, D, and E). This increase in 
energy expenditure occurred in the setting of unchanged respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (Figure 2C) 
and spontaneous physical activity (Figure 2F). Therefore, we characterized the BAT of HFD-fed Klb–/–
mice. With a slight reduction in its relative mass (Figure 2G), this tissue shows multilocular lipid droplets 
and an intense cytoplasmic staining compared with prominent unilocular lipid accumulation in BAT 
of HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 2H). Further, we observed increased expression levels of thermogenic 
and fat-oxidation-related genes (Ucp1, Ucp3, Dio2, Elovl3, Pgc1a, and Cidea) (Figure 2I), consistent with 
increased thermogenic activity of BAT in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice.
Klb–/– mice show a modified BA composition. Given the key role of FGF21/FGFR1c/β-klotho signaling 
in fat oxidation, glucose uptake, and energy homeostasis, the resistance of Klb–/– mice to DIO was an 
unexpected observation. Further, these findings raised the question of the underlying mechanism(s). Since

β-klotho is known to participate in a negative 
feedback loop that represses hepatic BA syn￾thesis (16, 17), we investigated whether Klb
deficiency could also qualitatively impact 
BA homeostasis. Cyp7a1, the rate-limiting 
enzyme in BA synthesis, was highly over￾expressed in the liver of Klb–/– mice (Figure 
3A), as previously reported (17). Cyp8b1
(encoding sterol 12-α-hydroxylase) was also 
upregulated, while Cyp7b1 and Cyp27a1
(driving the alternative [acidic] BA synthe￾sis) were underexpressed compared with 
WT mice (Figure 3B). This specific tran￾scriptional pattern of BA enzymes led us to 
investigate differences in hepatic primary BA 
production and the circulating BA composi￾tion. Primary BAs are directly synthesized by 
the liver and converted into secondary BAs 
by bacterial action in the colon. In the liver, 
tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-βMCA) levels 
were decreased in Klb–/– mice (Figure 3C), 
confirming the downregulation of the alter￾native pathway. Plasma levels of both pri￾mary taurocholic acid (T-CA) and its second￾ary derivative deoxycholic acid (conjugated 
[T-DCA] and unconjugated [DCA] forms) 
were dramatically increased in Klb–/– mice 
(Figure 3, D and E). The global composition 
of circulating BAs was substantially modified 
between genotypes, with a predominance of 
T-CA and T-DCA in Klb–/– mice (Figure 3F).
Klb–/– mice are protected against hepatosteatosis. The massive change in BA levels and composition in Klb–/–
mice led us to investigate further hepatic parameters. While liver weight was not changed in HFD-fed Klb–/–
mice (Figure 4A), hepatic histological sections (Figure 4B) and triglyceride content (Figure 4C) revealed lower 
hepatic lipid storage in Klb–/– versus WT mice on HFD. Further, plasma levels of total, HDL-, and LDL-cho￾lesterol were also significantly lower in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice (Figure 4D). Overexpression of the ligand Fgf21
and reduced expression of the receptor Fgfr4 were observed in the absence of Klb (Figure 4E). Hepatic gene 
expression of key transcriptional regulators involved in lipid and BA metabolism (Srebp1c, Shp, and Lrh1) was 
strongly reduced in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice (Figure 4F). A concomitant downregulation of enzymes responsible 
for fatty acid synthesis (Acaca, Fasn, and Scd1) and fatty acid oxidation (Cpt1a) was also observed in the liver of 
HFD-fed Klb–/– mice (Figure 4G). In line with their reduced hepatic triglyceride storage, HFD-fed Klb–/– mice 
showed higher Atgl and lower Dgat2 expression levels (Figure 4G), indicating stimulation of triglyceride break￾down and inhibition of triglyceride synthesis. Further, hepatic gene expression levels of enzymes responsible 
for cholesterol synthesis (Hmgcr and Hmgcs1) were higher in the HFD-fed Klb–/– mice (Figure 4H), highlighting 
the activation of cholesterogenesis in the context of derepressed BA synthesis. Surprisingly, despite their lower 
hepatic lipid storage, the HFD-fed Klb–/– mice exhibited higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Tnf, 
Il1b, and Il6) and lower expression of antiinflammatory marker (Nfkbia) in the liver (Figure 4I).
Resistance of Klb–/– mice to DIO is Tgr5 dependent. Previous reports demonstrated that nutritional supple￾mentation with BA during the consumption of HFD prevents the onset of obesity through activation of 
the membrane BA receptor (TGR5) in the BAT (19). Thus, to assess whether the change in plasma BA 
composition could be the mechanism involved in stimulating BAT and energy expenditure in the absence 
of β-klotho, we generated and phenotyped a double-KO mouse model (Klb–/–Tgr5–/– mice). At 10 weeks of 
age, Klb–/–Tgr5–/– mice were similar to Klb–/– mice, exhibiting a significantly lower BW compared with WT 
(Figure 5A, first time point). After 5 weeks on HFD, the body weight evolution in Klb–/–Tgr5–/– mice was

similar to that of the WT mice (Figure 5A). The loss of DIO resistance in Klb–/–Tgr5–/– mice is also evi￾denced by their similar fat mass and fat proportion compared with WT mice after HFD consumption (Fig￾ure 5, B and C). eWAT/BW ratio, VO2
, and RER were not different between Klb–/–Tgr5–/– and WT mice 
(Figure 5, D–G). The Klb–/–Tgr5–/– mice were also similar to WT in terms of BAT weight, morphology, and 
gene expression (Figure 5, H–J), consistent with the loss of higher thermogenesis observed in Klb–/– mice. 
Together, these data demonstrate that TGR5 signaling is involved in the increased energy expenditure and 
resistance to DIO in Klb–/– mice most likely mediating a modified BA signaling.
Klb–/– mice have modified microbiota composition. BAs are well known to regulate gut microbiota, and in 
turn gut bacteria modulate the composition and the level of BAs (20–22). Thus, the large excess of the sec￾ondary BA DCA observed in Klb–/– mice led us to assess their microbiota profile on both chow and HFD, 
using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Independently of the diet consumed, Klb–/– mice present a lower 
Shannon diversity index compared with WT (Figure 6A), reflecting more homogeneous populations of 
bacteria in their gut. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on the UniFrac distance (Figure 6B) shows 
different clustering positions of the Klb–/– and WT mice within and across diets, indicating an interaction 
between diet and genotype. At the taxonomic level, we also identified a clear pattern of sample cluster￾ing by diet and genotype (Figure 6C). Analysis of microbiota composition at the phylum level indicates a 
moderate increase of the Proteobacteria proportion and a moderate decrease of the Firmicutes proportion 
in Klb–/– versus WT mice on chow diet (Figure 6, D and E). HFD consumption increased the Firmicutes 
proportion at the expense of the Bacteroidetes proportion in WT mice (Figure 6, D and E), as previously 
reported (23–25). Interestingly, HFD-fed Klb–/– mice present a Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio similar to 
WT mice on chow diet (Figure 6E, insert panel). At the class level, qualitative and quantitative changes in 
Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Deltaproteobacteria explain the changes observed at the phylum level (data not

shown). We then analyzed the corresponding bacterial families and genera in more detail. At the family 
level, HFD-fed Klb–/– mice display a decreased proportion of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiales vadinBB60 
and an increased proportion of Prevotellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, and a trend towards an increase 
proportion of Bacteroidaceae and Bacteroidales S24-7 group compared with HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 
6F). At the genus level, Klb–/– mice on HFD show an increased proportion of Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, 
Rikenella, Alloprevotella, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, and Akkermansia, and a reduced proportion of Oscil￾libacter, Ruminococcus, and genera within Lachnospiraceae compared with HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 6G). 
Globally, these data demonstrate that the classical change in gut microbiota pattern induced by HFD con￾sumption was mitigated in Klb–/– mice.
Resistance of Klb–/– mice to DIO is DCA driven and microbiota dependent. The massive increase of DCA 
and T-DCA levels in Klb–/– mice led us to investigate the specific contribution of this secondary BA to 
the increase in energy expenditure on HFD. To this end, we treated orally (0.5 g/l in drinking water) both 
Klb–/– and WT mice with vancomycin (VCM) 1 week before initiation and during the entire period of HFD 
consumption. VCM is a poorly absorbed antibiotic preferentially targeting Gram-positive bacteria, includ￾ing Clostridium species classically described as responsible for the conversion of primary BAs into second￾ary BAs (such as 7α-dehydroxylation of CA into DCA; see ref. 26). VCM treatment similarly reshapes the 
gut microbiota of Klb–/– and WT mice, massively decreasing both intestinal Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes 
content in both genotypes on HFD (Figure 7A). In contrast, Proteobacteria content was not impacted by 
VCM in WT and showed an increasing trend in Klb–/– mice (Figure 7A). Notably, the reshaped microbiota 
presents drastically reduced 7α-dehydroxylation activity, leading to residual circulating levels of DCA and 
T-DCA (Figure 7, B and C). Instead, the circulating BA pool is mainly composed of T-βMCA and T-CA in 
WT mice and of T-CA in Klb–/– mice on HFD+VCM (Figure 7D). The specific pattern of primary BA syn￾thesis due to Klb deficiency was not affected by VCM treatment, since HFD-fed Klb–/– mice presented again

higher levels of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 and lower levels of Cyp7b1 compared with HFD-fed WT mice (Supple￾mental Figure 2A). Importantly, following VCM administration, Klb–/– mice lose their resistance to DIO. 
Indeed, they gain similar weight (Figure 7E) and exhibit similar fat proportion and content to that of WT 
(Figure 7F and Supplemental Figure 2B), despite a still lighter eWAT (Figure 7G); no major change was 
observed in adipose-targeted gene expression (Supplemental Figure 2, C and D), glucose tolerance (Figure 
7H), or stool energy content (Figure 7I). Consistently, BAT weight (Figure 8A) and morphology (Figure 8B) 
were indistinguishable between Klb–/– and WT mice on HFD+VCM. VO2
 (Figure 8, C and D), VCO2
(Supplemental Figure 2, E and F), and RER (Figure 8E) were also similar between Klb–/– and WT mice on 
HFD+VCM. Gene expression analysis in this tissue confirmed the abrogation of thermogenesis induction 
in Klb–/– mice on HFD+VCM, with a trend towards lower Ucp1, Dio2, and Elovl3 expression levels and sig￾nificantly lower Pgc1a and Cidea expression levels (Figure 8F). We also observed a massive increase in liver 
weight (Figure 8G), indicating a preferential storage of fat in the liver rather than in the WAT of Klb–/– mice 
in the absence of DCA-driven BAT overactivity (Figure 8, H and I). This observation is also corroborated 
by increased hepatic expression of the scavenger receptor (fatty acid translocase, Cd36) involved in lipid 
accumulation under excessive fat supply (Figure 8J). Finally, hepatic gene expression of cholesterogen￾esis enzymes (Figure 8K) and proinflammatory cytokines (Figure 8L) remained elevated in Klb–/– mice on 
HFD+VCM.
Discussion
FGF21 is one of the most promising drug candidates for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes (4); this is based 
on the metabolic protection observed in pharmacological administration studies (5), as well as in murine 
studies of transgenic overexpression (5, 6). In contrast, some metabolic abnormalities have been reported in 
Fgf21–/– mice. This includes impaired lipid utilization (27, 28), defects in gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis 
(29, 30), and defects in WAT browning (7) and BAT glucose uptake (31). Together, these results raise ques￾tions about the function of endogenous FGF21. β-Klotho, the obligate coreceptor for FGF21/FGFR1c 
signaling (2, 3), has been targeted to selectively abrogate FGF21 action in vivo (9, 10). In particular, tissue￾selective β-klotho deletions in adipose tissue (10) and in brain (11–13) have revealed the site of action of 
pharmacologic FGF21. FGF21 acts simultaneously on adipocytes and the hypothalamus to provide both the 
oxidative substrate and the central sympathetic outflow to drive thermogenesis and weight loss (4).
Thus, we expected that whole-body Klb–/– mice would be prone to developing metabolic disorders 
under hypercaloric feeding conditions (i.e., HFD) in the absence of endogenous FGF21 signaling. 
Counterintuitively, we observed that these mice are resistant to obesity due to an elevation in energy

expenditure associated with BAT overactivity. In addition to the interesting therapeutic value of phar￾macological recombinant FGF21 or FGF21 analogs, this surprising result leads to questions about the 
role of endogenous FGF21 signaling in adaptation to hypercaloric diet and suggests the existence of 
compensatory mechanisms underlying this metabolic protection.
β-Klotho is also the obligate coreceptor for FGF(15/19)/FGFR4 signaling occurring in the liver (14, 
15). Similar to the Klb–/– mice, Fgfr4–/– mice also exhibit improved metabolic status on HFD (32). However, 
the supraphysiologic levels of FGF15 and FGF21 observed in Fgfr4–/– mice might alleviate the consequences 
of HFD consumption by overstimulating the intact FGFR1c/β-klotho complex. In contrast, the Klb–/– mice 
have concomitant deficiencies in both FGF15/FGFR4 and FGF21/FGFR1c signaling pathways. Initial 
characterization revealed that the Klb–/– mice have a derepression of BA production and are resistant to 
diet-induced gallstone formation (17). We now demonstrate that global β-klotho deficiency elevated ther￾mogenesis and BAT activity on HFD, underlying a resistance to obesity. Our results are in accordance with 
a recent report showing limited weight gain in Klb–/– mice on HFD without mechanistic explanation of the 
observed phenomenon (18).
We presently show that Klb–/– mice exhibit a drastic shift in primary BA production with activation of 
the classical (neutral) BA pathway (higher hepatic Cyp8b1 expression and T-CA levels) at the expense of the 
alternative (acidic) BA pathway (lower hepatic Cyp7b1 expression and T-βMCA levels). This reveals that the 
ileo-hepatic FGF15/FGFR4/β-klotho negative feedback not only regulates the rate of BA synthesis but also 
alters BA composition in mice, as the hepatic FXR/MAFG pathway (33). Genetic and pharmacological 
approaches allowed us to demonstrate that the modified BA homeostasis is directly involved in activating

thermogenesis in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice. Indeed, the double-KO mice lacking both Klb and the membrane BA 
receptor Tgr5 (Klb–/–Tgr5–/–) are similar to WT in terms of fat accretion and energy expenditure, reflecting 
that these mice lose their protection against DIO. These results are in line with previous works demon￾strating that obesity can be prevented in mice receiving either nutritional supplementation with CA (19) or 
BA-binding resin (34). Despite opposite effects on BA synthesis, both of these interventions modify the BA 
composition, enriching the BA pool in CA and derivatives. Mechanistically, the activation of TGR5 in the 
BAT by hydrophobic BA led to a local Dio2 overexpression, thus driving tissular T3 elevation and stimulating 
thermogenesis (19). Together, these results confirm that BA composition, in particular a high hydrophobic￾ity, is a key endocrine signal driving thermogenesis in mice during nutritional fat overload.
A striking finding is our observation that the secondary BA DCA (in its conjugated and unconju￾gated forms) is the most abundant BA species in the circulation of Klb–/– mice. Generating DCA requires 
deconjugation of T-CA and subsequent 7α-dehydroxylation of CA into DCA. Both steps are catalyzed 
by bacterial enzymes (26). To dissociate the thermogenic potency of the primary CA and its secondary 
derivative DCA in vivo, we treated HFD-fed Klb–/– mice with the antibiotic VCM. This induced a mas￾sive shift in microbiota composition featured by a dramatic reduction in Gram-positive Bacteroidetes and 
Firmicutes. VCM treatment drastically abates conversion of CA into DCA, resulting in high CA levels and 
residual DCA levels (at the limit of detection). In this setting, the Klb–/– mice also lost their resistance to 
DIO, highlighting DCA as the main driver of thermogenesis and BAT stimulation. The specific thermo￾genic property of DCA presently observed in vivo is consistent with its higher potency to activate TGR5 in 
vitro (35). These observations add another layer of complexity to the thermogenic properties of BA, as gut 
microbiota appear to be a key intermediary in this process. Growing attention has been recently given to

the metabolic role of microbiota-dependent BA transformation (36–38). Most recent advances have shown 
that the level of BA deconjugation functionally regulates host lipid metabolism (39) and that gut microbiota 
could promote DIO through modulation of the BA profile, impacting FXR signaling (40, 41). This concept 
also covers human physiology; short-term oral administration of VCM to obese subjects concomitantly 
decreased secondary BA levels and lowered peripheral insulin sensitivity (42). It should be noted that the 
thermogenic properties of DCA specifically involve the stimulation of BAT, because Klb–/– mice showed 
no sign of browning in different WAT depots (epididymal, perirenal, and inguinal); this may stem from the 
low Tgr5 expression levels in these fat pads or absence of the cellular machinery needed for DCA signaling.
Several recent insights have also contributed to our understanding of the complex BA-mediated 
crosstalk between the liver and the gut microbiota. On one hand, the detergent properties of BAs exert 
a selective pressure on the intestinal bacteria; this regulates the proliferation and composition of the gut 
microbiota (20). In turn, gut microbiota modulate both the composition of the BA pool (through chemi￾cal transformations) and its amount (through modulation of the ileo-hepatic FXR/FGF15/FGFR4/β￾klotho axis that represses BA production; see refs. 21, 22). DCA is both generated by bacteria and has 
the highest antibacterial capacity among the BAs (20). The elevated DCA levels observed in Klb–/– mice 
raises questions about their gut microbiota composition. In basal conditions (chow diet), the microbiota 
content of Klb–/– mice shows few modifications compared with WT. Interestingly, these moderate chang￾es were largely amplified on HFD. In WT animals, fat intake is well known to specifically enrich gut 
microbiota in Firmicutes at the expense of Bacteroidetes (23–25). In contrast, the Klb–/– mice exhibited a 
markedly higher Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio on HFD compared with WT. Since Firmicutes-enriched

microbiota show enhanced energy 
harvesting from food (25), the rela￾tive underrepresentation of Fir￾micutes in Klb–/– mice could attenuate 
energy assimilation and potentially 
contributes to the observed resis￾tance to DIO. However, we saw a 
trend towards decreased fecal caloric 
content in HFD-fed Klb–/– compared 
with HFD-fed WT mice, suggesting 
at the very least equivalent energy 
harvesting efficiency. These results 
suggest that the specific microbiota 
composition in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice 
is not the primary cause of their 
resistance to DIO. Nevertheless, fur￾ther studies are warranted to eluci￾date whether the specific microbiota 
observed in Klb–/– mice can impact 
host energy partitioning via changes 
in short-chain fatty acid production 
(43, 44) or intestinal BA signaling 
(41, 45, 46).
Hepatosteatosis (nonalcoholic 
fatty liver, NAFL) is a classic com￾plication of obesity. Both endocrine 
FGFs and BAs are involved in regu￾lating hepatic lipid metabolism (47, 
48). Previous murine studies have 
demonstrated that genetic ablation 
or adenoviral knockdown of Fgf21
promotes hepatic fat accumulation 
(27, 49). The underlying mechanism 
could involve enhanced SREBP1c 
maturation (27) and/or increased ER 
stress in hepatocytes (50). In contrast, 
we observed that HFD-fed Klb–/– mice 
are protected against hepatosteatosis, 
as was previously shown for HFD￾fed Fgfr4–/– mice (51). These data suggest that disruption of hepatic FGF15/FGFR4/β-klotho signaling 
overcomes FGF21/FGFR1c/β-klotho signaling deficiency, preventing hepatic fat storage on HFD. The 
high BA levels seen in both Klb–/– and Fgfr4–/– models might mediate this protection against hepatic fat 
storage. Cyp7a1-transgenic mice with elevated BA levels are also resistant to hepatosteatosis (52). Srebp1c
is a key lipogenic transcription factor and is downregulated by CA or FXR agonists both in vivo and in 
vitro (53). Interestingly, HFD-fed Klb–/– mice have low hepatic expression levels of Srebp1c (and its target 
enzymes Acaca and Fasn) compared with HFD-fed WT mice, reflecting a BA-mediated repression of de 
novo hepatic lipogenesis. Further gene expression analyses in HFD-fed Klb–/– mice also revealed decreased 
hepatic triglyceride synthesis and increased triglyceride breakdown, in line with disrupted hepatic fatty 
acid availability. Interestingly, VCM administration to HFD-fed Klb–/– mice abolished not only resistance 
to DIO but also resistance to hepatosteatosis. This latter effect should also result from modified BA com￾position. Indeed, the abrogation of DCA production both mitigates the repression of de novo hepatic 
lipogenesis (DCA being a strong FXR agonist) and indirectly leads to hepatic fatty acid uptake (reflected 
in Cd36 upregulation) in the setting of decreased BAT lipid utilization. Consequently, the Klb–/– mice on 
HFD+VCM exhibit altered body fat distribution with a massively enlarged fatty liver (nearly double that

of WT). Thus, in the absence of DCA-driven BAT thermo￾genesis, Klb–/– mice become susceptible to hepatosteatosis 
and phenocopy Fgf21–/– mice (27, 49).
Compared with WT, Klb–/– mice exhibit increase levels 
of inflammation markers. This constitutive hepatic proin￾flammatory state is independent of hepatic fat storage or 
amount of DCA, unlikely reflecting a deleterious conse￾quence of BA excess. Moreover, Cyp7a1-transgenic mice 
show reduced hepatic inflammation despite high BA lev￾els (52). Thus, the hepatic inflammation observed in Klb–/–
mice may result directly from the lack of FGF21 signaling. 
Several reports have recently described a feedback loop 
between FGF21 signaling and inflammation; inflammatory 
mediators decrease FGF21 signaling through Klb-specific 
repression (54, 55), and in turn, FGF21 signaling exerts 
antiinflammatory effects (56–58). Interestingly, in the non￾obese model of fatty liver disease, FGF21 deficiency also 
worsened ER stress and inflammation (59, 60). Administra￾tion of FGF21 reversed these alterations, demonstrating a 
hepatoprotective action (59, 60).
To summarize, we document that Klb–/– mice are resis￾tant to DIO. The underlying mechanism involves activation 
of the classical (neutral) BA synthesis pathway at the expense of the alternative (acidic) pathway. High levels of 
hepatic CA production result in a large excess of microbiota-derived DCA. This secondary BA is specifically 
responsible for activating the TGR5 signaling pathway that stimulates BAT thermogenic activity (Figure 9). In 
the absence of DCA-driven thermogenesis, Klb–/– mice recover susceptibility to DIO yet display altered body 
fat distribution including ectopic hepatic fat storage. These data demonstrate that gut microbiota can be a key 
regulator of host thermogenesis via secondary BA production. From a translational point of view, it should be 
considered that BA metabolism is quite different between mice and humans. In particular, the persistence of 
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (instead of the rapid conversion into MCA in rodents) modifies the relative 
hydrophobicity of other BA species and possibly their signaling properties through TGR5 and FXR. Neverthe￾less, the thermogenic activity of BA seems conserved in humans. Oral supplementation with CDCA increased 
BAT activity and energy expenditure in healthy women (61). Using a pharmacologic or nutritional approach to 
selectively modulate BA composition may be a promising target for treating metabolic disorders.

synthesis and major changes in BA composition. This features 
an upregulation of the classic BA synthesis pathway (Cyp8b1) 
at the expense of the alternative BA synthesis pathway 
(Cyp7b1). The result is an excess of cholic acid (CA) leading to 
a large overproduction of microbiota-derived deoxycholic acid 
(DCA). DCA specifically activates thermogenesis in the brown 
adipose tissue (BAT) through the membrane receptor TGR5 and 
confers resistance to diet-induced obesity even in the absence 
of endogenous FGF21 signaling. Upregulation and/or stimula￾tion are represented by green arrows. Downregulation and/or

described Klb–/– mouse model (17). Neonatal overmortality of Klb–/– mice, previously reported on a 
mixed genetic background (17), was worsened on a pure C57BL/6J background, with only 5% to 10% 
of Klb–/– mice obtained from Klb+/– breeding. Double-KO Klb–/–Tgr5–/– mice were obtained through 
crossing Klb–/– (17) and Tgr5–/– mice (62). All animals used in this study were males backcrossed onto 
a pure C57BL/6J background for more than 10 generations. After weaning, Klb–/–, Klb–/–Tgr5–/–, and 
WT littermates were housed in standardized conditions (22°C, 12-hour light/dark cycle, free access to 
water and food) until sacrifice.
Diets. Mice received a normal chow diet containing 4.5% fat (diet 3436, Provimi Kliba) from weaning 
to 10 weeks of age, then switched to a HFD containing 60% of calories from fat (diet D12492, Research 
Diets) until sacrifice. BW was determined weekly.
Antibiotic treatment. One week prior to initiating HFD, mice received VCM (TEVA) via sterile drinking 
water at a concentration of 0.5 g/l. Water supply was renewed every 3 days until sacrifice.
Body composition. Lean mass, fat mass, and percentage fat were determined using MRI (Echo Medi￾cal Systems).
Glucose tolerance test. Glucose (2 mg/g BW) was injected intraperitoneally following an overnight fast.
Food intake. Food intake was measured for mice housed in individual cages for 3 consecutive days.
Indirect calorimetry and physical activity. After 48 hours of acclimatization, mean VO2
, VCO2
, and cumu￾lative spontaneous locomotor activity were measured during 2 consecutive light/dark periods by indirect, 
open-circuit calorimetry using an Oxymax system (Columbus Instruments).
Tissue collection. After a 3-hour fast (9:00–12:00), mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott) and 
immediately sacrificed. Organs were weighed prior to fixation or cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen.
Gene expression
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) or TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) follow￾ing homogenization with a Polytron (Kinematica) or FastPrep Lysing Matrix Tubes and Instrument 
(MP Biomedicals). Total RNA (1–5 μg) was reverse transcribed using the MMLV Reverse Transcriptase 
kit (Invitrogen). cDNAs were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using Power SYBR Green mix 
and the StepOne Plus Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and were normalized using 
the housekeeping gene Rps29. Primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosys￾tems) or were obtained from the University of Groningen database (http://www.labpediatricsrug.nl). 
The sequences of the primers used are provided in Supplemental Table 1.
Histology
Tissues were fixed in buffered formol fixative solution before dehydration and embedding in paraffin using 
a Leica ASP300S tissue processor (Leica). Five-micrometer sections prepared with a Microm HM 335 E 
microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were stained with H&E solution using classical procedures. Slides 
were then examined using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with brightfield optics at ×20 magnification 
before digital capture.
Blood, tissues and stools dosages
Blood samples were collected in heparin-coated tubes and immediately stored at 4°C. Plasma was ana￾lyzed for total, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides using the Cobas C111 robot and appropriate 
reagents (Roche Diagnostics). Liver triglyceride content was determined using a colorimetric diagnostic 
kit (Diasys). Plasma insulin and leptin were measured using the mouse MADKMAG-71K metabolic kit 
(Merck-Millipore). Glucose levels were measured using an ACCU-CHEK Aviva monitor (Roche Diag￾nostics). For fecal caloric determination, stools were collected and dried at 60°C to a constant weight. 
Mean energy content was measured for each cage using a bomb calorimeter (IKA C200). The BAs were 
measured by isotope-dilution high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS). The assay was performed by combining the specimen (50 μl) with the internal 
standards in methanol (100 μl) and by adding H2
O with 0.2 % formic acid (600 μl). Sample extraction and 
cleanup was performed using HLB SPE plates (Waters). LC-MS analysis was carried out using a Thermo 
Q-Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A volume of 10 μl extract was injected into an Acquity UPLC 
HSS T* 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm column. Operating conditions of the MS were full-scan acquisition in nega￾tive mode (–H m/z of 370 to 522, centroid acquisition, negative polarity).

Microbiota analysis
Bacterial DNA was isolated and purified from feces recovered from the colon using the QIAmp DNA 
Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). The phyla analysis following VCM administration was performed by quantita￾tive real-time PCR, as previously reported (63). For in-depth analysis of the microbiota composition, 
the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal gene was amplified by PCR (64). The amplified 
fragments were sequenced with the Miseq Reagent Kit v3 on an Illumina MiSeq machine producing 
paired-end 300-bp reads. The PANDAseq assembler was used to assemble raw paired reads into contigs 
(65). All contigs with any ambiguous nucleotides or with a length shorter than 390 nucleotides or lon￾ger than 450 nucleotides were removed from dataset. The reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 
sequences were identified using USEARCH software (version 8.1.1861) (66) after removing contig 
sequences that were not repeated at least 10 times across all samples. The abundance of OTUs in each 
sample library was computed using function search_global from USEARCH package (66). The 16S 
rRNA sequences with taxonomic annotation were obtained from the Silva database (67). All sequences 
with pintail quality score below 0.9 were removed from the 16S RNA sequence collection in order to 
avoid false taxonomic assignment related to the presence of chimeric sequences (68). The database was 
searched with the OTU reference sequences and the best hits with similarity exceeding 95% were used 
to assign taxonomy. The species-level assignment was kept only in case of sequences displaying nucleo￾tide similarity above 99%. All reference sequences that stayed unassigned were additionally classified 
using an online SINA alignment service with parameter minimal identity set to 0.9 (69). The Shannon 
diversity index was calculated using R package phyloseq (70). The ANOVA test followed by pairwise 
t test was used to assess statistical significance of differences in the mean value of scores between 
groups. The P values from pairwise comparison were adjusted using the Holm method. The clustering 
with UPGMA method and PCA of the data were performed using an unweighted UniFrac (71) dis￾tance matrix calculated with R package GUniFrac (72) based on the phylogenetic tree returned by the 
MUSCLE (73) program rooted with midpoint method with R package phangorn (74). The statistical 
significance of the difference in distribution of the Bacteroides/Firmicutes ratio in different groups was 
evaluated with the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test as post￾hoc test for pairwise comparisons. The obtained P values were adjusted using the Holm method. The 
differential abundance analysis of the phylum level was performed using a generalized linear model 
based on negative binomial distribution and the Wald test with R package DESeq2 (75). The probability 
values were corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
Statistics
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM for the indicated number of observations. The unpaired 2-tailed Stu￾dent’s t test and repeated-measures 1-way ANOVA were used when appropriate for comparison between 
groups of mice. P less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Experimental protocols were performed in accordance with Swiss animal welfare laws (SCAV, Canton de Vaud).
