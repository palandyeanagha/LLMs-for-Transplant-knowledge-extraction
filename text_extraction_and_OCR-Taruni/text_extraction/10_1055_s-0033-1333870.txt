All aspects of perioperative and postoperative care of kidney
transplant recipients need to be heavily scrutinized to ensure
optimal patient safety and clinical outcomes. Innovations in
care protocols must be tested in an evidence-based manner to
demonstrate efficacy. Although postoperative urine output
measurement with Foley catheterization is essential for kidney
transplant recipients, the optimal duration of catheterization is
not inexorable. The trend in most institutions is to err on the
side of leaving the catheter in for a longer period of time, to
ensure consistent urine output. Some1 recommend catheter
removal on postoperative day 5. The risks of prolonged Foley
catheterization are manifold. The first is increased risk of
catheter-associated urinary tract infection. This must be given
special consideration in the newly transplanted patient under￾going obligate immunosuppression. The second is decreased
patient mobility, which increases the risk of venous thrombo￾embolism and pneumonia, and hospital length of stay. For
these reasons, it is the practice in our institution to remove
Foley catheters on postoperative day 1 in live donor kidney
transplant recipients, provided they have met standardized
protocol criteria. The hypothetical risk of early catheter remov￾al is an increased risk of urine leak. It is believed that bladder
drainage with Foley catheterization relieves the tension on the
newly created ureteroneocystostomy anastomosis. If a leak is
present, catheterization may allow the leak to heal before
becoming clinically manifest.
Aim
The purpose of our study was to analyze the practice of Foley
catheter removal on postoperative day 1 in live donor kidney
transplant recipients and its correlation with urine leaks.

Abstract Catheterization of the urinary bladder during kidney transplantation is essential. The
optimal time to remove the Foley catheter postoperatively is not universally defined. It is
our practice to remove the Foley catheter on postoperative day 1 in live donor kidney
transplant recipients who meet our standardized protocol criteria. We believe that early
removal of Foley catheters increases patient comfort and mobility, decreases the risk of
catheter associated urinary tract infections, and allows for decreased hospital length of
stay. The hypothetical risk of early removal of Foley catheters would be the increased risk
of urine leak. We reviewed 120 consecutive live donor kidney transplant recipients and
found that there was not an increased incidence of urine leaks in patients whose Foley
catheters were removed on postoperative day 1.

Patients and Methods
We evaluated the clinical outcomes of 120 consecutive live
donor kidney transplant recipients. All patients underwent
color flow-grayscale duplex Doppler ultrasonography in the
post anesthesia care unit immediately after transplantation to
ensure adequate vascular flow and screen for the presence of
hydronephrosis or any fluid collections. Urine output was
replaced with an equivalent volume of intravenous fluid until
the morning after the transplant. Subsequently, patients were
kept on maintenance intravenous fluids (routinely 100 mL/h)
until able to tolerate adequate oral intake. In instances of
adequate urine output and no barriers to early ambulation,
Foley catheters were removed on postoperative day 1.
Patients who did not demonstrate consistent urine output
on postoperative day 1 had their catheters maintained for
longer. The reasons for extended catheterization included
delayed graft function, early rejection, and the need for
prolonged fluid or electrolyte replacement due to hypovole￾mia or electrolyte imbalances.
Urine leaks were most often suspected in instances of fluid
collections seen on imaging studies, such as color flow￾grayscale duplex Doppler ultrasonography, the presence of
urinoma, inadequate urine output, and or electrolyte or
creatinine abnormalities.
Results
Eighty-one (68%) of the 120 live donor kidney transplant
recipients had their Foley catheters removed on postopera￾tive day 1. Of the 81 patients, 6 (7.4%) developed urine leaks.
Of the six, three were managed with percutaneous nephros￾tomy tube drainage and ureteral stenting. Two underwent
interventional radiological drainage of perinephric urinoma
with subsequent resolution. The last had resolution of the
urinoma without any intervention based on subsequent
follow-up Doppler imaging. The remaining 39 patients had
their Foley catheters maintained due to delayed graft func￾tion, inadequate urine output, or any other critical issue
necessitating prolonged monitoring. Of those 39 patients, 3
(7.7%) developed urine leaks. Two of these were treated with
percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage and ureteral stent￾ing. One underwent interventional radiological drainage of
perinephric urinoma with subsequent resolution.
Discussion
Urine leaks are the most common urological complication
following kidney transplantation occurring in 5 to 10% of
cases.2,3 Most leaks are small and resolve without interven￾tion. When leaks persist, percutaneous nephrostomy tube
placement and ureteral stenting are the standard treatment.
Surgical re-exploration is rarely necessary.4 Some studies
recommend maintenance of the Foley catheter for 1 week
after a urine leak has been demonstrated5; however, there is
no suggestion or evidence that preemptive catheterization
will prevent urine leak.
In our study, 7.5% of total patients developed urinary leaks.
Of the patients who had catheters removed on postoperative
day 1, 7.4% developed urine leaks. Of the patients who had
catheters removed on greater than postoperative day 1, 7.7%
developed urine leaks. The overall numbers are similar in
incidence to those commonly reported in the literature. The
percentages of urine leak in postoperative day 1 removal
group and the greater than postoperative day 1 group were
similar. This indicates that the incidence of leak was not
increased by the early removal of Foley catheters.
Urine leaks are therefore not attributed to early Foley
catheter removal. Urine leaks can often be attributed to
microvascular damage to the ureteral blood supply. Such
injury can be present in the donor subclinically prior to
transplant, or can be incurred during allograft excision or
backbench preparation. Factors associated with increased
urine leaks after renal transplantation included male gender,
African American race, and surgical technique for ureter￾oneocystostomy anastomosis.6 Of note, in the studies linking
African American patients to greater risk of urine leaks,
African American patients were more often induced with
thymoglobulin. It is not definitive that induction with thy￾moglobulin has any correlation with urine leak, but a causal
relation has been observed.6 In our series, two patients
developed urine leaks after being treated with thymoglobu￾lin. One patient was an African American woman who
received thymoglobulin upon induction due to a positive
crossmatch for B and T cells. She also underwent preoperative
treatment with plasmapheresis and intravenous immuno￾globulin treatment. The second patient was treated with
thymoglobulin for an episode of acute rejection. Both patients
had Foley catheters in place for longer than 1 day postopera￾tively, and both were managed successfully with percutane￾ous nephrostomy tube placement and ureteral stenting.
There are studies that recommend routine ureteral stent￾ing at the time of transplantation to prevent urinary compli￾cations postoperatively.7 However, the study showed that
ureteral stenting bears an increased incidence of urinary tract
infection. Furthermore, the benefit was only seen in cadaveric
donor kidney transplantation, and that was primarily in the
reduction in postoperative urinary strictures. There was no
benefit in living donor kidney transplantation. We do not
routinely employ ureteral stents in living donor kidney
recipients at our institution.
Surgical technique for performance of the ureteroneocys￾tostomy anastomosis has also been implicated in the risk for
developing urine leaks after kidney transplantation and has
been studied.8 The intravesical Leadbetter–Politano technique
was found to have a higher leak rate than the extravesical Lich–
Gregoir technique. This was attributed to the second intra￾vesical cystostomy utilized in the intravesical Leadbetter–
Politano technique. When comparing extravesical techniques,
the U-Stitch technique had a higher leak rate than the Lich–
Gregoir technique. This was attributed to the lack of mucosa to
mucosa anastomosis in the U-Stitch technique. The study did
not find a difference between antireflux and non-antireflux
techniques. It is the practice in our institution to use a full
thickness ureter to bladder anastomosis.

Regarding the incidence rate of catheter-associated uri￾nary tract infections, studies indicated that 80% of nosocomial
UTIs are due to catheters. The risk of UTI increases by 3 to 7%
each day that it remains in the body.9 Twenty-five percent of
patients with catheters in for more than 1 week will contract
a UTI.10
Conclusion
In this study, we have shown that removal of Foley catheters
in live donor kidney transplant recipients on postoperative
day 1 does not increase the incidence of postoperative urine
leaks. We believe that early catheter removal has the potential
to decrease the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract
infections and hospital length of stay. We also believe that
it improves patient comfort, and promotes early postopera￾tive ambulation.11 We hope that these innovations in living
donor kidney transplantation will have continued success
and that we can extend these benefits to all categories of
kidney transplantation.
