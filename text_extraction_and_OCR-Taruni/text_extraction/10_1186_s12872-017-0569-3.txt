Efficacy and safety of oral sildenafil in
children with Down syndrome and
pulmonary hypertension
Maurice Beghetti1* , Andrzej Rudzinski2 and Min Zhang3
Abstract
Background: Despite the increased risk for pulmonary hypertension in children with Down syndrome, the
response to treatment with targeted therapies for pulmonary hypertension in these patients is not well
characterized. The Sildenafil in Treatment-naive children, Aged 1–17 years, with pulmonary arterial hypertension
(STARTS-1) trial was a dose-ranging study of the short-term efficacy and safety of oral sildenafil in children with
pulmonary arterial hypertension. We assessed the safety and efficacy of oral sildenafil in children with Down
syndrome and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Methods: This was a post-hoc analysis of children with Down syndrome and pulmonary arterial hypertension
enrolled in the STARTS-1 trial. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI),
and cardiac index (CI) were assessed at baseline and following 16 weeks of treatment with sildenafil.
Results: Of 234 patients randomized and treated in the STARTS-1 trial, 48 (20.5%) had Down syndrome. Although
sildenafil produced dose-related reductions in PVRI and mPAP, compared with placebo, in non–Down syndrome
patients and children developmentally able to exercise, this was not satisfactorily marked in patients with Down
syndrome. The dose-related reductions in PVRI, compared with placebo, occurred in all subgroups, with the
exception of the Down syndrome subgroup. Sildenafil appeared to be well tolerated in the Down syndrome
subpopulation and the most frequently reported AEs were similar to those reported for the entire STARTS-1
population.
Conclusion: Sildenafil treatment for 16 weeks had no effect on PVRI or mPAP in children with Down syndrome and
pulmonary arterial hypertension. The results suggest that children with Down syndrome may be less responsive to
sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension, but the incomplete work-up for the etiology of pulmonary arterial
hypertension may have introduced a potential bias.

Background
Down syndrome (DS) is the most commonly occurring
chromosomal abnormality at birth, with about 1 in 700
babies born each year in the United States having DS
[1]. In children with DS, the frequency of congenital
heart defects, mainly atrioventricular septal and ven￾tricular septal defects, is high [2], and many children
with DS have a high prevalence of associated respiratory
problems, in particular, upper airway obstruction [3].
Findings from a recent study of patients with DS living
in Mexico City (high altitude) showed that 40% had
congenital heart disease and 80% had pulmonary hyper￾tension (PH) assessed by echocardiography [4]. Children
with DS have a higher risk for developing PH due, in
part, to these congenital heart defects [5]. Other factors
that may play a role in the higher risk for PH in children
with DS include upper airway obstruction, lung hypopla￾sia, gastroesophageal reflux, abnormal pulmonary vascu￾lar function, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [6–8], and
an imbalance in mediators, such as nitric oxide, thromb￾oxane A2, and prostacyclin [9–11], which have been
implicated in the development of PH [12]. Despite the
increased risk for PH in children with DS, the response
to treatment with targeted therapies for PH in these
patients is not well characterized. The Sildenafil in
Treatment-naive children, Aged 1–17 years, with pul￾monary arterial hypertension (STARTS-1) trial was a
dose-ranging study of the short-term efficacy and safety
of oral sildenafil in pediatric patients with pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH) [13]. The purpose of this
report is to present the results of a post-hoc analysis of
the patients with DS enrolled in STARTS-1.
Methods
The STARTS-1 study design has been previously
published [13]. Briefly, children aged 1 to 17 years with
idiopathic PAH (IPAH), heritable PAH (HPAH), or PAH
associated with congenital heart defects (PAH-CHD)
were included. To be included, children had to have a
mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥25 mmHg at
rest, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤ 15 mmHg,
and pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) ≥3
Wood units × m2
. Children who were developmentally
able to exercise had to have a peak venous oxygen satur￾ation (pVO2) ≥10 mL/kg/min and ≤20 mL/kg/min dur￾ing a screening cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).
Children were randomized to placebo or sildenafil low,
medium, and high doses that were selected to achieve
maximum plasma concentrations of 47, 140, and
373 ng/mL, respectively, at steady state. Patients with
body weight between 8 and 20 kg were randomly
assigned to receive medium- (10 mg TID) or high -dose
(20 mg TID) sildenafil; patients between 20 and 45 kg
were randomly assigned to receive low- (10 mg TID),
medium- (20 mg TID), or high -dose (40 mg TID) sil￾denafil; and patients >45 kg were randomly assigned to
receive low- (10 mg TID), medium- (40 mg TID), or
high -dose (80 mg TID) sildenafil.
Randomization was stratified by weight and develop￾mental ability to perform a CPET (assessed using bicycle
ergometry). The primary outcome measure of pVO2 was
assessed by CPET only in children who were able to
exercise reliably at baseline and at week 16. This group
was termed “developmentally able”. The group termed
“non-developmentally able” included children who were
too young or who had other concomitant conditions
such as DS, which prevented them from performing the
CPET test as judged by the investigator. In all patients,
secondary outcome measures of mPAP, PVRI, and
cardiac index (CI) were assessed at baseline and at week
16. Complete physical examinations and laboratory tests
were performed in all patients, and investigators
recorded adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs)
throughout the study.
The secondary outcome measures were evaluated by
using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in which treat￾ment comparisons were made between each of the
sildenafil groups (low, medium, and high dose) and the
placebo group, and between the combined sildenafil
group and the placebo group. For PVRI and CI, changes
from baseline at week 16 were log-transformed before
data analysis due to normality assumptions that were
not met for untransformed data. For non-DS subjects,
ANCOVA was conducted with independent variables of
etiology, weight group, capability of performing the
CPET, log-transformed baseline value, and treatment;
for DS subjects, due to the limited number of subjects,
ANCOVA was conducted with independent variables of
log-transformed baseline value and treatment. For
mPAP, for non-DS subjects, ANCOVA was conducted
with independent variables of etiology, weight group,
capability of performing the CPET, and treatment; for
DS subjects, ANCOVA was conducted with the inde￾pendent variables of etiology and treatment. Statistical
hypothesis testing was performed at the 2-side 5%
significance level. Descriptive statistics were used to
describe AEs and SAEs.
Results
Of 234 patients randomized and treated in the STARTS￾1 trial, 48 (20.5%) had DS. Of the patients with DS, 15
were aged <7 years and 33 were aged ≥7 years; only 2 of
the 48 patients were developmentally able to exercise (1
patient each in sildenafil low- and medium-dose groups).
The number of patients with DS diagnosed with IPAH/
HPAH, PAH-CHD with surgical repair, and PAH-CHD
with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt was 5
(10.4%), 16 (33.3%), and 27 (56.3%), respectively.
Beghetti et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders (2017) 17:177 Page 2 of 9

Approximately 60% of the non-DS patients had non￾IPAH/HPAH, whereas approximately 90% of the DS pa￾tients had non-IPAH/HPAH. Therefore, there was an
imbalance across the etiology groups. Baseline demo￾graphic and clinical characteristics of the DS and non￾DS patients were similar (Tables 1 and 2).
Sildenafil produced a trend of dose-related reductions
in PVRI and mPAP compared with placebo in develop￾mentally able and non-DS patients but not in patients
with DS (Table 3 and Fig. 1). Similarly, among non￾IPAH/HPAH patients, sildenafil produced a trend in
dose-related improvements in PVRI and mPAP com￾pared with placebo in non-DS patients but not in pa￾tients with DS (Table 4). Further analysis by etiology of
the hemodynamic endpoints was performed with the DS
children excluded to assess if this subpopulation affected
the observed treatment responses.
The most frequently reported AEs were diarrhea,
vomiting, bronchitis, laryngitis, nasopharyngitis, cough,
and headache (Table 5). None appeared to be dose re￾lated and the majority of AEs were of mild or moderate
intensity. Four patients with DS reported SAEs. Two
SAEs were considered treatment related (both in the
high-dose sildenafil group): stridor in 1 patient during
the first week of therapy and ventricular arrhythmia in
the other patient. The other 2 patients received placebo
and the SAEs were considered unrelated to treatment.
Discussion
PAH is a chronic disorder characterized by a pro￾gressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
leading to right heart failure and, if left untreated,
death [12]. Children with DS are at a high risk for
PH2 but the response to treatment with targeted
therapies for PAH in pediatric DS patients is not well
characterized. The STARTS-1 trial evaluated the
effects of low, medium, and high oral doses of sil￾denafil in pediatric patients with PAH, including 48
patients with DS [13]. For the primary endpoint,
percent change in pVO2 from baseline to week 16,
assessed by CPET, the combined sildenafil doses
displayed a 7.7% (95% CI: –0.19, 15.60) improvement
over placebo, but failed to achieve statistical signifi￾cance (P = 0.056). CPET was performed only in
children old enough and able to exercise reliably.
However, secondary endpoints, including mPAP and
PVRI, were assessed in all enrolled patients and
improved with medium and high doses of sildenafil
treatment.
The present post-hoc analysis compared the effects
of sildenafil in the DS cohort with other subpopula￾tions enrolled in the STARTS-1 trial. Exercise
capacity is difficult to measure in patients with DS.
Intellectual disability and failure to understand the
test procedure can have major effects on the results
of exercise tests [14]. Because there were only 2
patients with DS that were developmentally able to
exercise, changes in pVO2 were not analyzed. For the
secondary endpoints of PVRI and mPAP, sildenafil
produced similar dose-dependent reductions com￾pared with placebo for all subgroups except the DS
subgroup. Similar to the results of the STARTS-1
trial, improvements in these hemodynamic parameters
in the non-DS subgroups were only seen with the
medium and high doses of sildenafil. The overall lack
of effect of sildenafil in children with DS suggests
that the response to PAH therapy may be different in
this group of patients compared with non-DS
children.
The effectiveness of PAH therapies in patients with
DS have been mixed and often include adult DS pa￾tients. In an open-label, observational study, endothe￾lin receptor antagonism with bosentan or sitaxentan
improved 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and WHO
functional class in adult patients with PAH-CHD with
or without DS [15]. In another open-label study of 24
adult patients with DS and Eisenmenger syndrome,
bosentan therapy resulted in increased 6MWD during
the first 3 months of bosentan treatment but slowly
returned to baseline after 26 and 52 weeks of therapy
[16]. Additionally, findings from an observational
study of 7 adults with DS and Eisenmenger syndrome

demonstrated improved exercise capacity and oxygen
saturation after exercise with long-term bosentan
therapy [17]. Duffels et al. [18] retrospectively
assessed changes from baseline in 6MWD following
6 months of treatment with bosentan in 58 adult
patients with PAH due to CHD, 28 patients with DS,
and 30 patients without DS. 6MWD improved signifi￾cantly from baseline at 6 months in the non-DS
patients but did not change in the DS patients. In
addition, Eipe et al. [19] reported a recent case of
severe PAH in an 11-year-old girl with DS who
continued to worsen despite maximal PAH therapy
with warfarin, sildenafil, bosentan, and inhaled
epoprostenol. The patient also had a patent foramen
ovale and was diagnosed with mild OSA possibly due
to enlarged tonsils. Following adenotonsillectomy and
initiation of continuous positive airways pressure to
treat the OSA, her PAH stabilized.
In the STARTS-1 trial, there was no prespecified
requirement to exclude OSA and/or upper airway ob￾struction that is not obviously symptomatic in DS. Thus,
it is unknown if some of the DS patients in the study
may have some type of upper airway obstruction that
could explain the lack of sildenafil response. Hawkins
et al. [3] reported in his series that 18 of 25 DS patients
screened for PH had some sort of airway disease, includ￾ing 12 who had upper airway obstruction. Even mild
upper airway obstruction may play a role in the develop￾ment of PH in this population of DS patients, particularly
if associated with CHD.
OSA has a higher prevalence in children with DS
(45% to 63%) [6, 20, 21] than in otherwise healthy
children (2%) [22], which may be related to mandibu￾lar hypoplasia, a large tongue with a relatively small
upper airway and generalized muscular hypotonia,
resulting in collapse of the airway during inspiration
[21, 23]. If snoring is not present, OSA is at times
clinically not suspected; however, this may contribute
to unexplained PH [21]. Large tonsils and adenoids
appear to precipitate OSA and upper airway obstruc￾tion in children that may lead to PH.
There are limited data regarding the effects of PAH
therapies in patients with OSA or upper airway ob￾struction. Roizenblatt et al. [24] assessed the effect of
sildenafil 50 mg at bedtime on nocturnal respiratory
and desaturation events in 14 middle-aged men with
severe OSA in a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover study. Sildenafil significantly increased the
frequency and duration of these events, which the
authors speculated may be due to increased nasal

congestion. The nasal congestion may even augment
upper airway obstruction and indeed may be deleteri￾ous for these patients. These problems may, in part,
explain the limited effect of sildenafil in this
population.
The results of the present analysis suggest that chil￾dren with DS and PAH may be less responsive to sil￾denafil therapy. This is also consistent with previous
studies that have documented reduced endothelium￾dependent vasodilation in DS patients compared with
age-matched healthy individuals [25] and an imbal￾ance in the synthesis of the vasoconstrictor thromb￾oxane A2 compared with the vasodilator prostacyclin
in children with DS [10]. In addition, children with
PAH-CHD and DS are less responsive to inhaled ni￾tric oxide than children with PAH-CHD but without
DS [26]. Finally, levels of circulating endothelial pro￾genitor cells, which may play a role in endothelial
repair and be predictive of cardiovascular events and
death from cardiovascular causes [27] are low and
more susceptible to oxidative damage in individuals
with DS compared with healthy individuals [28].
Moreover, circulating endothelial progenitor cells are
low in adult patients with Eisenmenger syndrome
compared with healthy individuals, and those with DS
had even fewer endothelial progenitor cells [29].
Hence, physicians need to carefully monitor vasodila￾tor therapy effectiveness when treating patients with
DS and PAH.
One potential reason for the increased incidence of
PAH in children with DS is that children with DS
may have pulmonary hypoplasia [8, 11]. One study
demonstrated that respiratory architecture develops
poorly in infants with DS [8]. Pulmonary hypoplasia
can lead to PAH because of enlarged alveoli and a
decrease in the number of alveoli, which means that
capillaries cover a proportionally smaller surface area
of alveoli [11]. However, other pathologies presenting
lung hypoplasia, such as congenital diaphragmatic
hernia, have shown response to sildenafil suggesting
that the latter may be not the only reason for non￾response in DS [30]. Additional studies are war￾ranted to determine whether pulmonary hypoplasia
plays a role in the limited effect of sildenafil in DS
children.
Sildenafil appeared to be well tolerated in this subpop￾ulation of patients with DS. The most frequently
reported AEs in the DS cohort were similar to those

reported for the entire STARTS-1 population [13]. Most
AEs were of mild or moderate intensity.
Limitations of this study include a small sample size
and the inability to analyze the primary efficacy outcome
of pVO2 in the DS cohort. Another potential limitation
is the difference in the baseline characteristics between
the DS and non-DS groups. An imbalance in etiology
was observed with approximately 60% of the non-DS
patients having non-IPAH/HPAH, whereas approximately
90% of the DS patients having non-IPAH/HPAH. The
STARTS-1 study inclusion criteria did not specifically ask
for a complete evaluation of DS and its pulmonary abnor￾malities. OSA and upper airway obstruction were not
completely ruled out in DS patients from the STARTS-1
study; these lung problems may have contributed to the
lack of sildenafil response. Recent studies also have
identified histologic evidence of alveolar simplification,
prominent bronchial vessels, intrapulmonary broncho￾pulmonary anastomoses, and impaired lung vascular
growth and signaling, which may increase the risk of
PAH and potentially explain limited effect of sildenafil
[31, 32]. In addition, due to the inherent limitations of
post-hoc analyses, the results of this study should be
regarded as hypothesis generating.
Conclusions
Sildenafil monotherapy treatment for 16 weeks had no
significant effect on PVRI or mPAP in children with DS
and PAH. Further studies are required to address and
confirm these results and better evaluate whether dosing
and/or respiratory screenings to exclude other potential
etiologies of PH may affect sildenafil efficacy.
