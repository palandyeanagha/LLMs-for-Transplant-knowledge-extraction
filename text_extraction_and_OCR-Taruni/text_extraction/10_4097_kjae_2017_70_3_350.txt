Liver transplantation (LT) is associated with significant 
blood loss and often requires significant transfusions. With the 
advancement of surgical and anesthetic techniques and concur￾rent understanding of the hemostatic system of end-stage liver 
disease [1], the incidence of massive bleeding and the need for 
transfusion have dramatically decreased over the last decade. LT 
in Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW) is especially challenging as their re￾ligious beliefs prohibit the acceptance of blood products, which 
often complicates medical and surgical treatment [2]. Although 
the likelihood of massive bleeding is reduced in modern LT 
surgery, there is still a chance of unexpected bleeding that may 
necessitate transfusions. We report two cases of living donor LT 
(LDLT) in adult JW patients at two hospitals without the admin￾istration of blood products.
Case Reports
Case 1
A 54-year-old female JW patient (body weight, 50 kg) diag￾nosed with liver cirrhosis complicated by hepatitis B viral infec￾tion presented to the bloodless center in our institute to assess 
whether LDLT was possible. She had massive ascites without 
encephalopathy, but was in good physical condition otherwise. 
Initial laboratory findings were hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.1 g/dl, 
platelets 51 × 109
/L, prothrombin time (PT) 1.65 (international 
normalized ratio, INR), albumin 2.1 g/dl, creatinine 1.5 mg/dl, 
and total bilirubin 3.04 mg/dl. We discussed with a surgeon the 
possibility of LT without transfusion. Acceptable transfusion 
Liver transplantation is especially challenging in patients who are Jehovah’s Witnesses because their religious beliefs 
prohibit the receipt of blood products. We present two cases of living donor liver transplantation performed in adult 
Jehovah’s Witnesses in South Korea without the use of blood products. In the first case, preoperative erythropoiesis￾stimulation therapy increased hemoglobin levels from 8.1 to 13.1 g/dl after 9 weeks. In the second case, hemoglobin 
levels increased from 7.4 to 10.8 g/dl after 6 months of erythropoiesis-stimulation therapy. With the combination of acute 
normovolemic hemodilution, intraoperative cell salvage, and use of transfusion alternatives, liver transplantation was 
successfully performed without transfusion of blood products.

alternatives were confirmed after discussion with the Jehovah’s 
Witnesses Hospital Liaison Committee and the patient. The pa￾tient refused to receive any red blood cells (RBCs), fresh frozen 
plasma, or platelet concentrate, but agreed to receive human 
albumin, recombinant factor VIIa and VIIIa, fibrinogen concen￾trate, cryoprecipitate, and intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) via a 
continuous circuit to the patient’s circulation. She also accepted 
reinfusion of collected whole blood acquired from acute normo￾volemic hemodilution (ANH) provided via a continuous circuit. 
The organ transplantation ethics committee then met to decide 
whether those surgical restrictions were ethically acceptable be￾cause this was the first LT in an adult JW patient in South Korea. 
Following committee approval, the patient decided to undergo 
LT. Her son, who is not a JW, chose to donate his right hepatic 
lobe.
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy with recom￾binant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) and intravenous iron 
was initiated along with folic acid and vitamin B12 to increase 
the patient’s red cell mass. Subcutaneous rHuEpo (EpokineⓇ, 
CJ HealthCare, Seoul, Korea) at 10,000 IU and intravenous iron 
(VenoferrumⓇ, JW Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea) at 200 mg 
were administered three times per week. After 9 weeks’ admin￾istration, the Hb level increased to 13.1 g/dl and the patient was 
scheduled for surgery the next day. On arrival at the operating 
theater, monitoring was initiated with a five-lead ECG, nonin￾vasive blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, and bispectral index 
sensor. Anesthesia was induced with propofol at 80 mg and, 
after the administration of rocuronium at 50 mg, the patient was 
intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, air, desflu￾rane, and continuous remifentanil and rocuronium infusion. 
Hemodynamic monitoring included the right radial and fem￾oral artery pressures, central and right femoral vein pressures, 
pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures, and cardiac 
output measurements via a Swan-Ganz catheter. A transesopha￾geal echocardiography probe was inserted to monitor volume 
status and systolic function and to diagnose the cause of any 
sustained hypotension that occurred during surgery. The right 
radial artery was used for blood sampling and drainage of the 
patient’s blood for ANH. After vascular catheterization, ANH 
was initiated. The patient’s blood volume was estimated at 3,000 
ml (60 ml/body weight, kg). The target Hb level was approxi￾mately 10.0 g/dl. We collected 960 ml of whole blood for ANH, 
which was divided into three CPDA-transfusion bags (320 ml 
each), while maintaining continuous infusion to the patient via 
the radial artery catheter. Briefly, we did not replace blood loss 
with fluid simultaneously as is usually done in ANH. No fluid 
was administered until after collection of the first 500 ml whole 
blood to prevent dilution of RBC, coagulation factors, and 
platelets. Thereafter, 750 ml 5% AlbuminⓇ (Green Cross Corp., 
Yongin, Korea) and 500 ml Plasma Solution AⓇ (CJ HealthCare, 
Seoul, Korea) were administered to replace lost blood until 
ANH was completed. It took 15 min to obtain each unit. There 
were no changes in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, mixed 
venous oxygen saturation (SvO2, maintained around 90%), or 
cardiac output during 45 min of ANH. Central venous pressure 
(CVP) decreased by 1 mmHg from the initial value of 4 mmHg. 
Pre-ANH Hb was 13.4 g/dl, platelets 32 × 109
/L, and fibrino￾gen 113 mg/dl. Post-ANH Hb was 10.8 g/dl, platelets 29 × 109
/
L, and fibrinogen 82 mg/dl. To prevent fibrinolysis, 40 mg/kg 
tranexamic acid was administered intravenously for 20 min be￾fore the surgical incision and then continuously infused at a rate 
of 10 mg/kg/h. All blood from the surgical field was salvaged 
using a cell saver until biliary anastomosis was initiated. Plasma 
Solution AⓇ was administered at a rate of 5 ml/kg/h during the 
surgery. Blood loss was replaced with Plasma Solution AⓇ at a 1 
: 3 ratio throughout the surgery unless there was sudden blood 
loss, which was replaced by 5% AlbuminⓇ at a 1 : 1 ratio. CVP 
was maintained at less than 5 mmHg throughout the dissection 
phase. Norepinephrine (0.1 to 0.27 µg/kg/min) was used as a 
primary vasopressor to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 65 
mmHg or above. During the pre-anhepatic phase, approximately 
7,300 ml ascitic fluid was drained. Acute hemorrhage occurred 
when the inferior vena cava was injured during mobilization 
of the diseased liver, which caused 350 ml of blood loss until 
prompt hemostasis using a total inferior vena cava (IVC) clamp. 
We began to transfuse salvaged blood approximately 1 h after 
starting surgery to maintain the hemoglobin level at around 9 g/
dl. One hour after beginning the anhepatic phase, ANH blood 
was retransfused slowly from the recently collected blood, as is 
recommended within 6 h of collection. The Hb level was main￾tained above 9 g/dl until the end of the surgery. Fibrinogen de￾creased to 56 mg/dl 3 h postoperatively. Fibrinogen concentrate 
(Fibrinogen InjⓇ, Green Cross Corp., Yongin, Korea) at 3.0 g 
was administered intravenously, which increased the fibrinogen 
concentration to 136 mg/dl.
There was no fibrinolysis on thromboelastography or ooz￾ing in the surgical field during the operation. Graft reperfusion 
was accomplished without any cardiovascular instability. SvO2 
remained high during the entire operation, suggesting that there 
was no global oxygen supply/demand imbalance. The operation 
concluded uneventfully and the patient was transferred to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) while intubated. The total anesthesia 
duration was 8 h and the operation time was 6.6 h. Total blood 
loss was 940 ml. Plasma Solution AⓇ at 4,800 ml, 5% AlbuminⓇ
at 1,000 ml, and 470 ml of salvaged blood were administered. 
Urine output was around 900 ml.
Postoperatively, Hb was 11.9 g/dl, platelets 19 × 109
/L, PT 2.49 
INR, and fibrinogen 122 mg/dl (Table 1). The postoperative re￾covery was uneventful and the patient did not receive any blood 
products. She was discharged on postoperative day 15 without

any complications. She is still in good health 5 years after surgery.
Case 2
A 47-year-old male JW patient suffering from alcoholic liver 
cirrhosis presented for LDLT. He had diabetes that was con￾trolled with insulin and was administered ESA therapy with 
rHuEpo, which increased his hematocrit in preparation for 
bloodless surgery. After 27 episodes of ESA therapy over the six 
months before LDLT, the Hb level increased from 7.4 to 10.8 
g/dl. Preoperative evaluations (echocardiography, pulmonary 
function test, esophagoduodenoscopy, chest radiography, and 
electrocardiogram) were within normal limits. Laboratory tests 
revealed Hb of 10.8 g/dl, platelets 46 × 109
/L, PT 1.84 INR, 
fibrinogen 159 mg/dl, and albumin 3.2 g/dl.
Anesthesia was induced with pentothal sodium at 400 mg, 
and after administration of vecuronium at 10 mg, the patient 
was intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, air, and 
sevoflurane. Hemodynamic monitoring included the right ra￾dial and femoral artery pressures, central and right femoral vein 
pressures, pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures, and 
cardiac output measurements via a Swan-Ganz catheter. Despite 
insertion of the Swan-Ganz catheter, cardiac output was not 
checked, so we monitored only SvO2. To maintain the body tem￾perature during surgery, fluid was heated with a Level 1Ⓡ Fast 
Flow Fluid Warmer (Smiths Industries, Rockland, MA, USA) 
and peripheral vascular access was blocked to prevent infusion 
of cold fluids.
During the intraoperative period, vecuronium was infused 
continuously (1.0 µg/kg/min) and sevoflurane was replaced with 
isoflurane after positioning the retractor. We regulated the con￾centration of isoflurane while aiming for 40 to 60 on the bispec￾tral index. During the pre-anhepatic phase, there were no ascites 
and 500 ml of HextendⓇ (CJ HealthCare) was infused. We used 
regular insulin because the patient’s glucose was 219 mg/dl and 
dopamine (5.0 µg/kg/min) was administered continuously for 
hemodynamic stability. Arterial blood gas analysis was per￾formed every 1 h to monitor the Hb level. The authors adminis￾tered 300 ml salvaged blood whenever the Hb level dropped be￾low 9 g/dl. The lowest Hb level was 6.7 g/dl during the anhepatic 
phase. Continuous infusion of norepinephrine (0.05 µg/kg/min) 
was started before reperfusion and tranexamic acid at 500 mg 
was injected twice during the anhepatic and postreperfusion 
phase. There was no evidence of fibrinolysis on thromboelas￾tometry, which was monitored at least every 2 h during surgery. 
To reduce blood loss, we used ICS except during biliary opening 
until the end of surgery. To conserve fluid effectively, we wrung 
out the gauze pads prior to removing them from the abdominal 
cavity. 
During the 12 h and 30 min of surgical time, 8,300 ml Plas￾ma Solution AⓇ, 2,050 ml 5% AlbuminⓇ, 900 ml half normal 
saline, 1,000 ml HextendⓇ, and 2,065 ml of salvaged blood were 
infused. Urine output was 570 ml and estimated blood loss was 
about 2,500 ml. After surgery, the patient was transferred to the 
ICU while still intubated with continuation of dopamine (5 µg/
kg/min) and norepinephrine (0.2 µg/kg/min).

The last blood test before the end of anesthesia revealed Hb 
of 10.5 g/dl, platelets 39 × 109
/L, PT 7.75 INR, and fibrinogen 49 
mg/dl (Table 2). The patient was extubated on the first postop￾erative day. Although he could not receive a transfusion of fresh 
frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate, PT was decreased and fibrino￾gen was increased with 2.18 INR and 211 mg/dl, respectively 
about 7 days after LDLT.
On postoperative day 17, leakage of the hepaticojejunostomy 
and small bowel perforation were suspected, so the patient 
underwent a second operation for resection and anastomosis 
of the small bowel. Continuous renal replacement therapy was 
initiated and maintained until postoperative day 28. He was 
transferred to the ward 36 days after LDLT, but was reintubated 
and transferred to the ICU on postoperative day 60 due to hypo￾tension and respiratory failure. He died on postoperative day 76 
due to several complications including intra-abdominal infec￾tion, pneumonia, and chronic renal failure.
Discussion
Blood transfusions during LT have decreased dramatically 
during the last decade owing to the advancement of surgical and 
anesthetic techniques. Nonetheless, this surgery is still likely to 
necessitate transfusions due to associated blood loss, the inci￾dence of which varies widely among transplantation centers. 
JWs refuse to accept transfusions due to their religious beliefs, 
which present a challenge to the surgical team. LT in JW pa￾tients has been successfully performed in the United States [3,4] 
and Europe [5,6]. Reports consistently suggest that successful 
LT in JW patients requires a judicious combination of careful 
patient selection, preoperative optimization of RBC quantity, in￾traoperative blood conservation strategies (ANH and ICS), use 
of transfusion alternatives, and adaptive anesthetic techniques. 
With regard to patient selection, although no universal se￾lection criteria exist to select the most ideal LT candidates who 
are JW patients, a minimum preoperative hematocrit of 35% is 
consistently required among reports [3,6]. The most important 
aspect of preoperative preparation of a LT recipient is to increase 
red blood cells to a safe level to account for blood loss. Addi￾tionally, the initial Hb value was the only biochemical variable 
linked to RBC transfusions in 700 consecutive LT patients [7]. 
This is usually achieved with ESA therapy consisting of rHuEpo 
and iron therapy. In previous reports, the dose of rHuEpo in JW 
LT patients varied among institutions, ranging from 10,000 to 
40,000 IU/wk [3,4]. Response to therapy usually occurs within 
1–2 weeks. In the current cases, it took 9–24 weeks of ESA ther￾apy to restore the Hb level sufficiently to proceed with surgery. 
Implementation of intraoperative blood conservation strate￾gies is also important to achieve transfusion-free surgery. ANH 
and ICS are acceptable for most JW patients during surgery and 
are therefore widely used. In the first case, the authors were able 
to collect about 1 L of whole blood using ANH. Notably, we did 
not administer fluids until we had collected 500 ml of whole 
blood to acquire coagulation factors and platelets as well as 
undiluted RBCs. Our technique differs slightly from the conven￾tional ANH technique in which an equivalent volume of colloid 
or crystalloid is infused simultaneously to maintain normovole￾mia [8]. Fortunately, the patient did not develop hypotension or 
tachycardia during this period. 
In both cases, ICS was used to conserve blood in the surgical 
field. This technique has been reported to conserve 2.1 g/dl of 
Hb per patient or two RBC unit transfusions for LT operation [9]. 
We retransfused 470 ml and 2,065 ml of salvaged blood, respec￾tively, in our two cases. Again, this is relevant to save two to five 
units of RBCs.
In both cases, the Hb level was regarded as the indicator of 
the need for salvaged blood retransfusion (ICS and ANH blood) 
to maintain the Hb level at around 9 g/dl. Some advocate for 
using physiologic monitors such as SvO2 and cerebral oximetry 
to evaluate global and regional perfusion [10]. This can com￾pensate for the intermittent nature of Hb measurement, which 
may not detect acute changes in global or regional oxygenation 
during the operation. Thus, continuous SvO2 monitoring may 
be helpful to assess the need for re-infusion of salvaged blood.

However, in the current case report, SvO2 remained high during 
the various phases of LT (sudden or protracted blood loss), even 
when the Hb level decreased to 6.7 g/dl. A consistent SvO2 can 
result from sufficient supply and decreased oxygen demand dur￾ing anesthesia. 
Replacement of coagulation factors as well as RBC is also 
challenging because JW patients will not accept fresh frozen 
plasma or platelets. Alternatives to coagulation factor replace￾ment are therefore important. In contrast to the second case, the 
patient in the first case agreed to receive cryoprecipitate. This 
was possible because acceptance of cryoprecipitate depends on 
the patient’s free will, apart from church doctrine. However, we 
administered fibrinogen concentrate in place of cryoprecipitate 
because of potential advantages such as decreased immunogenic 
and infectious complications, as well as rapid availability be￾cause fibrinogen concentrate does not need to be thawed [11]. 
Fibrinogen is the first coagulation factor to decrease when blood 
loss occurs with subsequent volume replacement [11]. Replacing 
fibrinogen can support fibrin clotting even without transfusion 
of platelets. Fibrinogen concentrate contains pure fibrinogen, 
making fibrinogen levels after administration predictable. In the 
first case, 3.0 g of fibrinogen concentrate increased the level by 
80 mg/dl, from 56 mg/dl to 136 mg/dl. It has been reported that 
administration of 1 g of fibrinogen concentrate increases the 
fibrinogen level by 25 mg/dl [12], which is consistent with the 
first case. 
Antifibrinolytic therapy has also been shown to decrease the 
incidence and amount of transfusion when used when used 
in LT. In both cases, we used tranexamic acid to achieve this 
goal. It is controversial whether antifibrinolytic agents are re￾lated to thrombotic events. A single center study reported that 
all patients who developed intracardiac thrombosis had not 
received antifibrinolytics, suggesting that antifibrinolytics do 
not predispose to intracardic thrombosis [13]. Others advocate 
that routine administration of antifibrinolytics is not indicated 
because of the low incidence and successful treatment of hyper￾fibrinolysis in patients who are bleeding and showing signs of 
hyperfibrinolysis on thromboelastography [14]. As there is no 
consensus regarding the routine use of antifibrinolytics for LT 
in JW patients, the authors used this agent to reduce blood loss 
while risking thrombosis. 
In the first case, we restricted fluids with concomitant use 
of a low CVP. We kept the CVP close to 5 mmHg during the 
pre-anhepatic and anhepatic phases. This was achieved by ad￾ministering 5 ml/kg/h of crystalloids and occasional colloids 
according to the quantity of blood lost. A recent randomized 
controlled trial that evaluated the effect of a low CVP during the 
pre-anhepatic and anhepatic phases revealed that this strategy 
significantly decreased blood loss [15]. 
In summary, LDLT in JW patients can be successfully per￾formed in carefully selected patients by using preoperative RBC 
augmentation, intraoperative blood conservation techniques 
such as ANH and ICS, transfusion alternatives and antifibrino￾lytics, and anesthetic protocols that reduce intraoperative blood 
loss.
