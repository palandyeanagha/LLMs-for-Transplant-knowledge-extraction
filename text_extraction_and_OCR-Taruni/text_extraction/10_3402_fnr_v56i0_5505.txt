Abstract
Vitamin K is present in the diet in the forms of phylloquinone and menaquinones. Phylloquinone, which is the
major dietary source, is concentrated in leafy plants and is the vitamin K form best characterized in terms of
food composition and dietary intakes. In contrast, menaquinones are the product of bacterial production or
conversion from dietary phylloquinone. Food composition databases are limited for menaquinones and
their presence in foods varies by region. Dietary intakes of all forms of vitamin K vary widely among age
groups and population subgroups. Similarly, the utilization of vitamin K from different forms and food
sources appear to vary, although our understanding of vitamin K is still rudimentary in light of new
developments regarding the menaquinones.
Keywords: vitamin K; phylloquinone; menaquinones; food composition; dietary intake
The term ‘vitamin K’ represents a family of
compounds with a common chemical structure,
2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone (Fig. 1).
Food sources
Phylloquinone
Phylloquinone, also referred to as vitamin K1, is a
compound present in all photosynthetic plants (1).
Phylloquinone is the primary dietary source of vitamin
K. In general, green, leafy vegetables contain the highest
known phylloquinone concentrations and contribute
approximately 60% of total phylloquinone intake (2,
3). As indicated in Table 1, spinach and collards, which
have concomitant high concentrations of chlorophyll
associated with the photosynthetic process, hence, dark
leaf color have substantially higher concentrations of
phylloquinone compared to the more commonly con￾sumed iceberg lettuce, which is substantially paler,
hence, lower chlorophyll concentrations. The other plant
sources of phylloquinone are certain plant oils including
soybean, canola (also known as rapeseed), cottonseed,
and olive (Table 1). Margarine, spreads, and salad
dressings derived from these plant oils are important
dietary sources of phylloquinone (4, 5). Plant oils are
used for preparation of multiple mixed dishes, hence
many commercially prepared foods including baked
goods also contain small amounts of phylloquinone.
Although multiple databases now exist that contain
some phylloquinone contents of foods (6, 7), the most
extensive analysis of phylloquinone in common foods
using established food sampling protocols (8) are found
in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (http://
www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR
22/nutrilistsr22a430.pdf; accessed 05.22.10).
2?,3?-Dihydrophylloquinone
The commercial hydrogenation of phylloquinone-rich
oils results in a transformation of phylloquinone into a
hydrogenated form, 2?,3?-dihydrophylloquinone (9). As
expected, trans fatty acid concentrations are highly
correlated with dihydrophylloquinone concentrations
(10). In the US food supply commercial hydrogenation
of plant oils was a common practice that prolonged
shelf life of the oil-based products. Many foods sold in
fast-food restaurants and frozen prepared products such
as fast-food French fries, doughnuts, and breaded fish
sticks contained high concentrations of 2?,3?-dihydro￾phylloquinone (5) (Table 1). However, with current
controversy regarding the health consequences of trans
fatty acid intake (11), there have been regional trans fat
bans in the US food supply. It is anticipated that the
decrease in hydrogenation of plant oils will also reduce
the presence of dihydrophylloquinone in the US food
supply, hence monitoring of this form of vitamin K in
the food supply is warranted. Unlike trans fatty acids,
dihydrophylloquinone is only present in hydrogenated

plant oils, hence monitoring this form of vitamin K in
the food supply is a robust approach to monitoring the
practice of commercial hydrogenation of plant oils.
Menaquinones
Menaquinones are the other category of vitamin K pre￾sent in the food supply (Fig. 1). Menaquinones are often
referred to as Vitamin K2, which is somewhat misleading
given that all menaquinones are not alike in their
origin or their function. Menaquinones are primarily of
bacterial origin, and differ in structure from phylloqui￾none in their 3-substituted lipophilic side chain. The
major menaquinones contain 410 repeating isoprenoid
units indicated by MK-4 to MK-10; forms up to 13
isoprenoid groups have been identified.
Menaquinone-4 (MK-4) (Fig. 1) is unique among the
menaquinones in that it is not of bacterial origin. Instead,
MK-4 is formed by a realkylation step from menadione
present in animal feeds or is the product of tissue-specific
conversion directly from dietary phylloquinone (12, 13).

In the United States, menadione is the synthetic form of
vitamin K used in poultry feed. As such, MK-4 formed
from menadione is present in poultry products in the US
food supply (14). However, MK-4 formed from phyllo￾quinone is limited to organs not commonly consumed in
the diet including kidney. The exceptions are dairy
products with MK-4 found in milk, butter, and cheese,
albeit in modest amounts. Therefore it is unlikely that
MK-4 is an important dietary source of vitamin K in
food supplies that do not use menadione for poultry feed
nor are rich in dairy products.
There is growing interest in the health benefits of
longer-chain menaquinones, which are limited to certain
foods in the food supply. Menaquinone-7 (MK-7) is
primarily the product of fermentation using bacillus
subtilis natto and is present in a traditional Japanese
soybean-based product called natto. Natto contains
approximately 2.5 times more MK-7 compared to the
phylloquinone content of spinach (Table 1). Natto also
contains MK-8 and phylloquinone (84 and 35 mg/100 g,
respectively), although both are modest in concentration
compared to MK-7 (6). Some cheeses also contain MK-8
and MK-9 (6), but these are dependent on cheese
production practices, hence the food composition data￾bases are limited in their ability to characterize mena￾quinone intake across different food supplies.
Dietary intakes
The current US dietary guidelines for intakes of vitamin
K are 90 and 120 mg/day for women and men, respectively
(15). These guidelines are termed adequate intakes (AI)
because the Institute of Medicine concluded in 2001 that
there were insufficient data available to generate a precise
recommendation for vitamin K. The AI values for
vitamin K were generated from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III, 19881994) and based on the median phylloquinone
intake in the United States for each age and gender
category (15). In the absence of abnormal bleeding
associated with low vitamin K intakes among adults, it
was assumed that the current intakes are adequate.
However, the adequacy of intake defined by an absence
of bleeding is controversial. Furthermore, the elderly
report median intakes below the current AI for adults. As
reviewed elsewhere (16), there is controversy regarding
biochemical measures of subclinical vitamin K deficiency
and as a consequence, the true dietary requirement of
vitamin K is unknown. For the purpose of this review,
dietary intakes of vitamin K will be presented relative to
the current AI. By comparison, the guidelines in the
United Kingdom are 1 mg/kg body/day (17) and are set at
75 mg/day for adult men, 60 mg/day for women, aged 18
29 year, and 65 mg/day for women 30 years and over in
Japan (18).
Estimates of phylloquinone intake in various popula￾tions are probably more accurate than intakes of other
forms of vitamin K and there is a substantial difference in
the reported intakes from a number of countries, which
seems to be related to food consumption practices in
different areas (1823). For example, the mean reported
vitamin K intake of young Japanese women (mean
21.2 years, n124) was about 230 mg/day (18). The
estimated phylloquinone intakes in northern China,
England, and Scotland were 247, 103, and 70 mg/day,
respectively (23, 24). Of note, phylloquinone intakes have
been decreasing over the last two decades in the United
Kingdom, consistent with a concomitant decline in leafy
green vegetable consumption (25). Based on the
NHANES III data, the elderly (defined as older as
71 years of age) have median phylloquinone intakes
lower than the current AI (89 and 79 mg/day for women
and men, respectively). This observation supports the
findings of others who have reported very low phylloqui￾none intakes among those in nursing homes (26) and
those with Alzheimer’s disease (27). Given emerging
association of low vitamin K intakes with risk of certain
diseases such as cardiovascular disease and osteoarthritis
(16), the elderly present a potentially vulnerable subgroup
of the population with respect to vitamin K.
Very little is known about the contribution of dietary
menaquinones to overall vitamin K nutrition and
although it has been stated that approximately 50% of
the daily requirement for vitamin K is supplied by the gut
flora through the production of menaquinones, there is
little evidence to support this estimate (28). In one study
among adults with acute bacterial overgrowth as induced
by omeprazole, menaquinones produced by these bac￾teria had some contribution to vitamin K status during
dietary phylloquinone restriction, but not enough to
restore biochemical measures of vitamin back to normal
range (29).
As previously indicated, there are regional differences in
the forms and content of menaquinones in the food supply.
For example, natto is unique to a traditional Japanese
diet whereas the cheeses that contain high concentrations
of MK-8 and MK-9 appear to be most prevalent in
European dairy producing food supplies. Although there
are reported menaquinone intakes, these are limited to
studies from Japan (18) and the Netherlands (21), and are
low compared to phylloquinone intakes. In the United
States, menaquinones are limited in the food supply and
have not been systematically assessed.
Are all forms of vitamin K the same?
There are surprisingly little data on the relative biological
availability of different forms of vitamin K among
different food sources. Furthermore, there is a growing
body of literature to suggest that our understanding of
Vitamin K in foods

(page number not for citation purpose)

vitamin K is still rudimentary in light of new develop￾ments regarding different forms.
As previously stated, phylloquinone is of plant origin,
with absolute intakes being predominantly from green
leafy vegetables. Phylloquinone is tightly bound to the
membranes of plant chloroplasts, and is less bioavailable
compared to phylloquinone obtained from plant oils and/
or dietary supplements (30). Some estimates place the
absorption of phylloquinone to be 10% from plants
compared to supplements (31). However there appear
to be differences in absorption compared to the plant
species, with phylloquinone obtained from broccoli and
collards having greater absorption compared to spinach
(31, 32). Similarly, and not unexpected because vitamin K
is lipophilic, addition of a fat source to the meal results
in higher absorption. For a more comprehensive review
of vitamin K absorption, the readers are referred
elsewhere (33).
Phylloquinone differs from 2?,3?-dihydrophylloquinone
by a saturation of a single bond at the 2?,3? position of the
side chain (9). Surprisingly this single substitution results
in a lower absorption of dihydophylloquinone compared
to an equimolar amount of phylloquinone (34). There is
also indirect evidence of lower activity of dihydrophyllo￾quinone as an enzyme cofactor, which currently is the
only known function of vitamin K. The implications of
this poor bioavailability and activity are currently un￾known, although at least one study suggests a detrimental
effect on bone mineral density among older adults in a
community-based cohort (35). The potential impact of
poor utilization of dihydrophylloquinone on bone health
will be of little importance in the future should hydro￾genated oils be removed from the food supply.
The menaquinones are poorly understood in terms of
vitamin K absorption and utilization. MK-7, when
administered in the form of natto in equimolar amounts
to phylloquinone administered in the form of spinach,
has a peak height difference of more than 10-fold
compared to phylloquinone, with a half-life of 56 hours,
compared to 7.5 hours for phylloquinone (36). Whereas
all forms of vitamin K appear to be initially associated
with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), the longer
chain menaquinones including MK-7 and MK-9 are
also associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL).
MK-4 has been reported in TRL, LDL, and high density
lipoproteins. These preliminary data suggest that the
menaquinones have different transport pathways and
distribution, which has implications for transport to
extra-hepatic tissue such as bone (33).
Emerging studies on MK-4 challenge our current
understanding of vitamin K. As demonstrated using
stable isotopes, MK-4 is a conversion product of phyllo￾quinone via the intermediate, menadione (37). There
appears to be both local and systemic conversion to
MK-4, with the local conversion being the predominant
pathway. The implications of this conversion are still the
topic of speculation. To add complexity to the interpreta￾tion is the observation that this conversion does not occur
in all tissues. Whereas the liver contains primarily
phylloquinone and very long-chain menaquinones,
MK-4 is the predominant form in the brain, pancreas,
and glands (38). In terms of dietary intakes, MK-4 intakes
are low compared to other forms of vitamin K. However,
dietary phylloquinone converts to MK-4 in those tissues
where MK-4 appears to be required so it is likely that low
MK-4 intakes are of little consequence to health when
there is adequate dietary phylloquinone available for
conversion to MK-4.
In conclusion, much of our understanding of vitamin
K nutrition has focused on the primary dietary source,
phylloquinone. There are comprehensive databases avail￾able that contain phylloquinone contents of a variety of
foods. Dietary assessment of phylloquinone reveals
variation in intakes by age and population subgroups.
In contrast, the menaquinones are present in the food
supply, but there are limited food composition data
available. As a corollary, estimates of intakes of mena￾quinones are very limited and our understanding of their
role in vitamin K nutrition is not well understood.
