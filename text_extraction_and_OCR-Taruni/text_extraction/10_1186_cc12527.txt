Introduction
Coagulopathy in critically ill patients is common and of 
multifactorial origin [1]. Coagulopathy-associated risk of 
bleeding and the use of allogeneic blood pro ducts are 
independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality 
[2,3]. Th erefore, prompt and correct identifi cation of the 
underlying causes of these coagulation abnormalities is 
required, since each coagulation abnormality necessitates 
very diff erent therapeutic management strategies. St an-
 dard laboratory tests of blood coagulation yield only 
partial diagnostic information, and important coagula￾tion defects, e.g., reduced clot stability, platelet dysfunc￾tion, or hyperfi brinolysis, remain undetected. Th erefore, 
point-of-care (POC) diagnostics are increasingly being 
used for rapid specifi c testing of hemostatic function. 
Algorithm-based hemotherapy, including POC tech￾niques, reliably corrects coagulopathy, but may also have 
the potential to reduce blood loss, transfusion require￾ments and risk of transfusion-related adverse events, 
prevent thromboembolic events, and save costs.
Th is article reviews the most frequent coagulation
abnor malities in critically ill patients. In particular, we
will discuss diff erential diagnoses, benefi ts and limita￾tions of POC coagulation management and hemotherapy
al gorithms.
Diagnosis of coagulopathy in intensive care 
medicine
Coagulopathy in critically ill patients is typically a
multifactorial problem involving:
• disturbances in physiological basic conditions for 
hemostasis (pH, concentration of ionized calcium, 
temperature and hematocrit)
• disturbances of primary hemostasis, e.g., preexisting 
or perioperatively acquired disturbances of platelet 
count and function, due to sepsis, disseminated intra￾vascular coagulation (DIC), heparin-induced thrombo￾cytopenia, massive blood loss, or drug-induced 
thrombo cytopenia;
• abnormalities of blood plasma, e.g., preoperative anti￾coagulation medication as well as isolated or global 
clotting-factor defi cits (impaired synthesis, massive 
loss, or increased turnover);
• complex coagulopathies, e.g., DIC or hyperfi brinolysis 
(Figure 1) [1].
In patients with extracorporeal life support (ventri￾cul ar-assis t devices, extracor poreal membrane oxygena￾tion [4] ), the risk of coagulopathy is further increased by:
• therapeutic anticoagulation with the use of heparin to 
limit clotting;
• dilution, activation and consumption of both coagu la￾tion factors and platelets.
Limitations of conventional laboratory coagulation 
analyses
Th e conventional laboratory coagulation analyses (Quick’s 
test, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), plate￾let count, fi brinogen concentration) may be of limited use 
for the prediction and detection of coagulopathies and 
for treatment monitoring, in particular in patients with 
ongoing bleeding [5]. Analysis at a standardized tempera￾ture of 37 °C impedes the detec tion of coagulopathies 
induced by hypothermia. Th e global tests (e.g., aPTT and 
Quick’s test) refl ect only the initial formation of thrombin 
in plasma and are unaff ected by any of the corpuscular 
elements of the blood. Th e platelet coun t is purely 
quantitative and cannot detect preexisting, drug-induced, 
or peri operatively acquired platelet dysfunction. More￾over, conventional coagulation tests convey no infor￾mation about clot stability over time, nor do they provide 
any information regarding (hyper-)fi brinolysis. Th us, it is

critically important to recognize that routine coagulation 
tests cannot detect clinically signifi cant coagulation 
defects that contribute to bleeding, hypo- or hyper￾fi brinolysis, hypercoagulability, and platelet aggregation.
Point-of-care techniques
In contrast to standard laboratory tests, POC techniques, 
including whole blood platelet function tests (impedance 
or turbidimetric aggregometry) and viscoelastic tests 
(thromboelastometry/-graphy), refl ect in detail the 
hemostatic status of the critically ill patient. Th e use of 
POC diagnostics may partly compensate for the methodo￾logical limitations of conventional coagulation testing. 
Test results are also available earlier (analysis time of 20 
to 25 minutes [6]) compared to conventional laboratory 
analyses (turnaround time of 40 to 90 minutes after blood 
drawing [7]), for w hich the delayed results may not refl ect 
the current state of the coagulation system and may lead 
to inappropriate treatment.
However, none of the currently available POC tech￾niques can provide adequate information about all 
aspects of the complex process of blood clotting. From a 
pathophysiological point of view, coagulation can be 
divided into four areas: Primary hemostasis, thrombin 
generation, clot formation/stabilization, and fi brinolysis.
Aggregometric testing of whole-blood samples is used 
mainly to study platelet function [8]. In bleeding patients 
in whom the hematocrit is greater than 30 % and the 
platelet count e xceeds 70–100/nl, aggregometric tests 
can be used to screen for disorders of primary hemo￾stasis, e.g., von Willebrand syndrome, and to quantify the 
eff ect of antiplatelet medications. Th e available aggrego￾metric POC tests (Multiplate®
, PFA-100®
, TEG®
 Platelet 
MappingTM Assay, VerifyNow®
) diff er in the agonists that 
are used to activate the platelets in the test cells, such as 
collagen, adenosine phosphate, epinephrine, arachidonic 
acid, and thrombin, and in the shearing forces that are 
generated in the test cells.
Viscoelastic POC techniques (ROTEM®
, TEG®
) are based 
on thromboelastography, which was described decades 
ago by Hartert [9]. Th ese tests are used to measure the 
time until clot forma tion begins, the dynamics of clot 
formation, and the solidity and stability of clots over time. 
Th ey enable parallel measurements to be performed on a 
single blood sample after clotting has been activated using 
a variety of agonists. A special advantage of viscoelastic 
techn iques is that they can directly detect hyper fi brino￾lysis. Aggregometric tests combined with viscoelastic 
methods yield a far broader diagnostic spectrum than do 
conventional laboratory testing of coagulation.

Implementation of POC testing in intensive care 
medicine
Cardiovascular surgery
Most of the previous trials related to POC coagulation 
testing were performed in cardiac surgical patients [10–
13]. Th e m ajorit y reported a potential decrease in trans￾fusion requirements following POC diagnostics. In two 
studies, the authors exclusively focused on coagulo pathic 
patients [13,14], in wh om POC techniques resulted in 
signifi cantly reduced postoperative blood loss and 
benefi cial eff ects in terms of clinically relevant endpoints. 
Nuttall et al. [14] randomized patients to a control group 
following individual anesthesiologist’s transfusion practices 
or a pro tocol group using a transfusion algorithm guided 
by coagulation tests (prothrombin time, aPTT, platelet 
counts, thromboelastogram maximum amplitude, and fi -
brinogen concentration). We recently published the 
results of a prospective study including coagulopathic 
patients in whom diff use bleeding was diagnosed after 
he parin reversal or increased blood loss was observed 
during the fi rst 24  hours postoperatively; the previous 
protocol group of Nuttall et  al. was now defi ned as our 
control group with conventional tests (platelet count, 
fi brinogen concentration, international normalized ratio 
[INR], aPTT, and activated clotting time [ACT]), and 
patients in the POC-guided group received repeated 
thromboelastometry and whole blood impedance 
aggregometry [13]. Th e followi ng endpoints were lower 
in the POC-guided group: Erythrocyte, frozen plasma 
and platelet transfusion rates; postoperative mechanical 
ventilation duration; length of ICU stay; composite 
adverse events rate; costs of hemostatic therapy; and 
6-month mortality (Figure 2).
Our fi ndings support those of a recently published 
retrospective study by Gorlinger et al. [15] that included 
 3,865  cardiac surgery patients in whom POC testing 
combined with fi rst-line administration of coagulation 
factor concentrates was as sociated with decreased incidence 
of blood transfusion and adverse events. In ICU patients 
undergoing mechanical circulatory support, monitoring 
of hemostasis using POC thromboelastometry/-graphy 
and platelet function analysis is also recommended to 
reduce the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic 
complications [4]. Notably, these hemostatic tests should 
be performed repeatedly during mechanical circulatory 
support therapy since thrombin generation, clot fi rmness 
and platelet response may change signifi cantly over time 
with marked inter- and intra-individ ual variability. 
Organ transplantation
In patients with liver transplantation, signifi cant blood 
loss has been found to be an independent risk factor for 
postoperative morbidity. To date, there is no consensus 
as to how to monitor and manage perioperative blood 
loss. In a prospective randomized study, Wang et  al. 
recently randomized 28  patients undergoing ortho topic 
liver transplantation either to standard laboratory 
measures of blood coagulation or thromboelastography 
analysis. POC-guided transfusion was associated with 
decreased transfusion of frozen plasma (12.8 ± 7 vs. 
21.5 ± 1 2.7 units), but did not aff ect 3-year survival [16]. 
Analyzing more than 18, 000 thromboelastography mea￾surements in the context of 642  patients with liver 
transplantation, the implementation of a POC coagu la￾tion management based on early, calculated, goal￾directed therapy with fi brinogen concentrate, prothrombin 
complex concentrate and antifi brinolytic therapy resulted 
in early detection of hyperfi brinolysis and consequently 
antifi brinolytic therapy [17], and a reduction in trans￾fusion requirements for erythrocytes, fresh frozen plasma 
(FFP), and platelets as well as a reduced incidence of 
massive transfusion [18].
Massive bleeding and trauma patients
When critically ill patient s need u rgent massive trans￾fusion because of massive blood loss, there may not be 
enough time to analyze the results of POC testing before 
the erythrocyte transfusion is given. However, coagu la￾tion factor defi ciency is the primary cause of coagulopathy 
in massive transfusion because of dilution of coagulation 
factors. Th e level of fi brinogen typically falls below the 
lower reference range after 150  % blood volume loss, 
followed by a decrease in other coagulation factors to 
25  % activity after 200  % blood loss [19]. FFP alone, if 
given in suffi cient quantity (>  15–20  ml/kg), will most 
likely correct fi brinogen and most coagulation factor 
defi ciencies, but large volumes may be required, which 
are further associated with infectious complica tions [20] 
and multiple organ failure [21] ; therefore goal-directed 
therap y with coagulation factor concentrates should be 
preferred [18] in patients outside the clinica l setting of 
‘massive transfusion’.
In major trauma patients, coagulop athy has been 
shown to be present in approximately 30 % of admitted 
patients, accounting for up to 40 % of all trauma-related 
deaths [22]. Although FFP transfusion is often a routine 
part of transfusion protocols, its effi cacy is uncertain. 
Most notably, FFP administration is also associated with 
acute lung injury (ALI), volume overload, and nosocomial 
infection [20,21]. Additionally, trauma-associated coagulo￾pathy is the consequence of a low admission fi brinogen 
level, which is independently associated with injury 
severity score, shock, and mortality at 24 h and 28 days 
after trauma. In a prospective cohort study of 517 trauma 
patients, thromboelastography enabled rapid detection of 
hypofi brinogenemia, and early administration of fi brino￾gen was related with improved survival [23]. Using rapid 
thromboelastography, Holcomb et al. re cently succeeded 
Meybohm et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:218

in identifying patients with an increased risk of fi brino￾lysis and erythrocyte, plasma and platelet transfusions 
out of 1,974  major trauma patients [24]. Schochl et  al. 
[25] retrospectively analyzed the eff ects of thrombo￾elastometry-guided hemostatic therapy in 131   trauma 
patients who received ≥ 5 erythrocyte concentrate units 
within 24 hours after admission. POC-guided hemostatic 
therapy with fi brinogen concentrate as fi rst-line hemo￾static therapy (if maximum clot fi rmness [MCF] measured 
by FibTEM [fi brin-based test] was <10mm) and additional 
use of prothrombin complex concentrate (if clotting time 
measured by extrinsic activation test [EXTEM] > 1.5 
times normal) allowed rapid and reliable diag nosis of the 
underlying coagulopathy, and resulted in a favorable 
survival rate compared with predicted mortality [25]. 
Although a recent meta-analysis concluded that use of a 
thromboelastography- or thromboelastometry-guided 
trans fusion strategy signifi cantly reduced bleeding in 
massively transfused patients, these POC techni ques were 
not, however, able to improve morbidity or mortality in 
patients with massive transfusion [26]. Th erefore, pros￾pec tive randomized studies focusing on POC-guided 
therapy are needed in these patients.
Severe sepsis
Because hemostatic alterations are a common early event 
in patients with severe sepsis, and commonly used sepsis 
biomarkers, such as procalcitonin and interleukin (IL)-6, 
may also increase in patients with trauma or surgery even 
without infection, thromboelastometry variables may 
have potential as early biomarkers of sepsis in critically ill 
patients. Adamzik and colleagues [27] recently demon￾strated, in an observational coho rt study of 56  patients 
with severe sepsis and 52  patients after major surgery,

that the thromboelastometry-derived lysis index was a 
more reliable biomarker of severe sepsis than were 
procalcitonin, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP). More 
interestingly, a multivariate analysis of another cohort 
study of 98 sep tic patients [28] revealed that the absence 
or presence of at least one pathological thrombo￾elastometry variable allowed better prediction of 30-day 
survival in severe sepsis than did the simplifi ed acute 
physiology system (SAPS) II and sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) scores, emphasizing the im portance 
of the coagulation system and the future role of POC 
techniques in sepsis.
Economic aspects
Results of the currently available trials do not allow any 
fi rm conclusions about the putative economic savings 
resulting from the use of POC coagulation testing. A 
number of retrospective studies have compared the costs 
of hemotherapy before and after the implementation of 
POC-based hemotherapy algorithms, albeit with partially 
confl icting results. In a study of 1,422 patients undergoing 
elective cardiac surgery, Spalding et al. found that imple￾mentation of POC coagulation testing lowered the cost of 
allogeneic blood products and other hemo thera peutic 
agents by about 50 % [29]. Th e total cost of POC testing 
(devices, reagents, te st tubes, control solutions, main￾tenance, etc.) exceeds that of conventional coagulation 
testing, because combined viscoelastic and aggregometric 
coagulation testing costs about €25 to €35, whereas a 
conventional test battery (aPTT, fi brinogen, thrombin 
time, Quick, complete blood count) generally costs less 
than €10. Taken together, it appears that POC-guided 
coagulation therapy indeed lowers the rate of transfusion 
of allogeneic blood products overall (mainly by lowering 
FFP and platelet transfusion rates), but simultaneously 
increases the use of clotting-factor concentrates (mainly 
fi brinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates) [15]. 
Th e economic savings from the reduced use of allogeneic 
blood products, may, however, compensate for or out￾weigh these increased expenditures in clotting-factor 
concentrates [13].
Hemotherapy algorithm including point-of-care 
technique s
Coagulation management in intensive care medicine 
should be based on a hemotherapy algorithm that includes 
POC techniques, and that is implemented as institutional 
standard care (Figure 3). Hemotherapy should involve an 
assessment of the patient’s individual bleeding risk, 
ev aluation and correction of basic physiological condi￾tions required for hemostasis, and repeated evaluation 
and correction of thrombin and clot formation. If 
indicated, replacing defi cient coagulation factors and 
improving the hemostatic potential of the primary 
hemo stasis are consecutive steps in therapy escalation. 
Final options are off label use of factor XIII and 
recombinant factor VIIa.
Maintain optimal physiological conditions for hemostasis
Th e patient’s physiological pH and core temperature 
should be maintained at > 7.3 and > 36 °C, respectively. 
Calcium is an elementary cofac tor in several enzymatic 
processes during coagulation. It is important to maintain 
a plasma ionized calcium concentration of > 1.0 mmol/l. 
With respect to the rheological properties of erythro cytes 
and the provision of thromboxane A2 and adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP) for platelet aggregation, hematocrit 
should be maintained at a concentration of > 25% [19].
Antagonize anticoagulant therapy
In patients with previous heparin therapy (e.g., extra￾corporeal life support, renal replacement therapy) and 
ongoing bleeding, it is necessary to exclude any persistent 
heparin eff ects. Protamine is routinely used to antagonize 
heparin. However, if the ACT remains > 130 s or visco￾elastic measures indicate persistent heparin eff ects, it 
may be necessary to administer additional protamine 
(30 IU/kg) and to re-evaluate its therapeutic eff ect.
Newer anticoagulants include both direct and indirect 
inhibitors of coagulation factors. Th e indirect (anti￾thrombin-dependent) inhibitors include the low molecular 
weight heparins (e.g., enoxaparin and dalteparin) and 
selective factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., fondaparinux and 
rivaroxaban). Th e direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., lepiru￾din, argatroban, bivalirudin, and dabigatran) directly bind 
to and inhibit thrombin. Approximately 60 % of the 
anticoagulant eff ect of low-molecular-weight heparins 
can also be neutralized by protamine. In contrast, there 
are no specifi c reversal agents for any of the newer anti￾coagulants; prothrombin complex concentrates might be 
benefi cial for the treatment of anticoagulant-associated 
coagulation factor defi ciencies (dose ranges from 25 to 
100 U/kg depending on the product used). In patients 
with life-threatening bleeding, hemodialysis might be 
considered to remove selected small-molecule anti coagu￾lants (e.g., lepirudin, dabigatran) [30]. 
Maintain adequate levels of coagulation factors
If coagulopathy persists following reversal of the anti￾coagulant eff ects, it should be ensured that adequate 
levels of coagulation factors are maintained. Fibrinogen is 
the fi rst coagulation factor to decrease below lower 
reference values during bleeding [31]. As the precursor to 
fi brin, and as a ligand for platelet aggregation, fi brinogen 
plays a key role in clot formation [32]. Th us, if plasma 
levels of fi brinogen decrea se below 150–200 mg/dl, or if 
viscoelastic tests indicate a defi ciency (if maximum clot 
fi rmness measured by FibTEM is < 10 mm), it is necessary

to administer fi brinogen substitute. In the past, FFP 
(15–30 ml/kg) was used as a source of replacement 
fi brinogen. But again, the transfusion of FFP is, under 
certain condi tions, associated with volume overload, 
sepsis, multiple organ failure, and increased peri opera￾tive mortality [20,21]. An alternative source of fi brino￾gen is fi bri nogen co ncentrate, which should be used at a 
concentration of 25–50 mg/kg. A recent review of trials 
in which fi brino gen concentrate was used in peri￾operative settings or in cases of massive hemorrhage 
suggests that this form of substitution is both eff ective 
and well tolerated [33].
If coagulopathy persists even though fi brinogen h as 
been supplemented, and if the INR is > 1.4, or if visco￾elastic measures reveal a defi ciency of prothrombin￾complex coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, then 
substi tution of these factors is indicated. A dosage of 15–
30 ml/kg FFP is necessary to increase the concentration 
of these factors. However, the use of a prothrombin￾complex concentrate, which contains factors II, VII, IX, 
and X, proteins C and S, heparin, and antithrombin, 
repre sents an attractive alternative because of the smaller 
volumes required to supplement the defi ciency (recom￾mended dose 20–30 IU/kg) [34].
Platelets
After the substitution of coagulation factors, the therapy 
algorithm should lead to a consideration of both platelet 
count and function. Importantly, temperature has a 
strong impact on platelet function [35]. Primary hemo￾stasis may further be im paired by preexis ting or peri￾operatively-acquired disturbances of platelet func tion, or 
isolated thrombocytopenia from sepsis, DIC, heparin￾induced thrombocytopenia, massive blood loss, or drug￾induced thrombocytopenia. In addition, use of extra￾corporeal circulation may also cause irreversible platelet 
damage mainly as a result of mechanical defragmentation 
and reduced platelet surface glycoproteins (GPIb and 
GPIIb/IIIa), which are important for platelet adhesion 
and aggregation [36].
Routine standard laboratory analyses are of limited 
in formative value as they only provide a quantitative 
measure of platelet numbers without providing any 
information regarding platelet functionality. In contrast, 
aggregometric measures allow assessment of platelet 
function by measuring the amount of platelet aggregation 
induced in the presence of common platelet agonists 
such as thrombin, arachidonic acid, ADP, epinephrine, or 
collagen. Aggregometric tests help to identify surgical 
patients at increased risk of bleeding or with resistance to 
anti-platelet therapy and, therefore, at increased risk of 
thromboembolism. Moreover, these tests may help to 
analyze the extent of platelet dysfunction in critically ill 
patients [37]. However, the clinical outcome benefi ts of 
including these tests in hemotherapy algorithms have not 
yet been investigated.
If platelet function has been shown to be defi cient, 
administration of desamino-D-arginine vas opressin 
(DDAVP) represents a therapeutic option. DDAVP 
(0.3 μg/kg) has been shown to induce a three-fold 
increase in von-Willebrand factor and factor VIII [38]. 
Th ese factors promote an incre ase in platelet-endo thelial 
cell adhesion via the GPIb receptor and platelet-platelet 
aggregation via the GPIIb/IIIa re ceptor. Hemostatic 
potential can further be improved by transfusion of 
platelet concentrates; one unit of platelet concentrate 
increases the platelet count by approximately 30,000/μl. 
However, there are inherent risks associated with the 
transfusion of platelet concentrates, in particular risk of 
bacterial and/or viral infections. Additionally, the 
number and functionality of platelets in platelet concen￾trates decreases with storage time [39].
Ultima ratio
If coagulopathy persists and surgical causes for bleeding 
have been ruled out, off -label use of two additional 
coagulation factor concentrat es, factor XIII and activated 
factor VII, may represent an ‘ultima ratio’ therapeutic 
approach. Factor XIII enhances blood clot stability by 
cross-linking fi brin monomers and integrating alpha 
2-antiplasmin into developing clots. Th ere is no routinely 
available test pa rameter that can indicate factor XIII 
defi ciency. In addition, there are currently no standard￾ized reference values. However, especially in diff use 
bleeding, factor XIII substitution (15–30 IU/kg) may be 
indicated to achieve a factor XIII activity above 60–70 % 
[40].
Administration of recombinant factor VIIa (90 μg/kg) 
induces a so-called ‘thrombin burst’. As the fi nal stage of 
the therapy algorithm, this approach may potentially 
reverse life-threatening coagulopathy. However, several 
conditions, such as plasma pH ≥ 7.2, fi brinogen concen￾tration > 150 mg/dl, platelet count > 50,000/μl, hematocrit 
≥ 25 %, ionized calcium concentration > 1 mmol/l and 
body temperature > 36 °C, should be met before factor 
VIIa is administered. Moreover, as highlighted in a recent 
systematic review, the eff ectiveness of recombinant factor 
VIIa in reducing the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood 
products or perioperative blood loss remains contro￾versial [41].
Conclusion
In the absence of prospective, randomized trials, ade￾quate data are not yet available regarding the use of POC 
techniques in critically ill patients in the ICU. Never￾theless, POC coagulat ion testing is faster and more com￾pre hensive than conventional laboratory tests of blood 
coagulation, and enables eff ective and economical

hemotherapy. None of the POC techniques covers the 
whole spectrum of hemostasis, thus the combination of 
aggregometric and viscoelastic methods is recommended. 
Hemotherapy should be based on an escalating algorithm 
including POC diagnostics, which is adapted to the 
specifi c bleeding risks of the patient’s condition (e.g., 
cardiovascular surgery, organ transplantation, and 
trauma surgery). In this respect, POC techniques should 
be an integral part of a patient blood management 
program [42]; beyond this, POC analysis may also enable 
diagnosis of sepsis-induced hemostatic alterations, and 
may even have the potential to predict mortality in septic 
patients. Finally, prospective studies are urgently needed 
to analyze whether hemostatic therapy based on POC 
testing can provide signifi cant benefi ts with respect to 
clinical outcomes for our critical care patients.
