ABSTRACT
Over the past decade, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), a near room temperature 
ionized gas has shown its promising application in cancer therapy. Two CAP devices, 
namely dielectric barrier discharge and plasma jet, show significantly anti-cancer 
capacity over dozens of cancer cell lines in vitro and several subcutaneous xenograft 
tumors in vivo. In contrast to conventional anti-cancer approaches and drugs, CAP 
is a selective anti-cancer treatment modality. Thus far establishing the chemical and 
molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer capacity of CAP is far from complete. In 
this review, we provide a comprehensive introduction of the basics of CAP, state of 
the art research in this field, the primary challenges, and future directions to cancer 
biologists.
PLASMA AND COLD PLASMA
There are four fundamental states of matter: solid, 
liquid, gas, and plasma (Figure 1a). As the energy exerting 
on atoms increases, the thermal motion of atoms in the 
solid aggravates and finally overcomes the restrictive 
interaction between atoms in solid such as ionic bond 
and forms liquid. Similarly, when the atoms in liquid 
obtain adequately large energy to overcome the restrictive 
Van der Waals force from surrounding atoms, these 
liquid atoms will transfer into gas atoms. Obviously, the 
translational energy of atoms in gas is much larger than 
that in liquid and in solid. When the energy is large enough 
for the electron to overcome the electrostatic potential 
barrier, the electron will be stripped away creating a free 
electron and a positive charged ion. This process is called 
ionization. The plasma is on avarage a neutral ionized gas 
composed of positive charged ions, electrons, and neutral 
particles. 
In general, temperature increases when matters 
transform from solid to liquid to gas and to plasma. The 
temperature of plasma is determined by thermal motions 
of electrons and heavy particles such as atoms and ions. 
In the case of a common thermal plasma, when the 
density of particles is high, due to intensive collisions 
between eletrons and heavy particles, all particles 
approach thermal equilibrium [1]. The temperature in 
such plasma is high, over several thousand degrees [1]. 
These plasmas are typically used under the atmospheric 
pressure conditions. On the other hand, if atmospheric 
pressure plasma discharge is fast, there is another class 
of plasmas in which electrons and heavy particles are in 
thermal non-equilibrium. In this case, temperature of the 
heave particles is much lower than that of the electrons 
(Figure 1b). We shall call these plasmas, cold atmospheric 
plasmas (CAP). The heavy particle temperature of CAP 
is between 25°C and 45°C [2]. Such plasmas can be used 
in biomedicine [3]. Many reactive species including 
oxygen-based radicals, nitrogen-based radicals, and other 
components are generated in CAP [4-6]. This complicated 
chemistry leads to a myriad of interaction between CAP 
and biological systems including cells and tissues [7-9]. 
CAP DEVICES
Two main approaches have been widely used to 
generate CAP, namely direct and indirect discharges. 
In an indirect discharge, the active plasma species are 
transported by a gas flow from the main discharge arc. 
In a direct discharge, living tissue or cells is one of the 
electrodes and is an active part of the discharge. Based

these principles, two CAP devices, the plasma jet [6, 10, 
11] and the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) [12, 13], 
have been developed and widely used in plasma medicine 
[14-22]. The plasma jet is also called the plasma pencil 
[23, 24], the plasma needle [2, 25, 26], or the plasma gun 
[27] in some references. As shown in Figure 2, the plasma 
jet device and the DBD device share similar physical 
principles, components, and materials. In these two 
devices, a violet plasma is generated between an annode 
and a cathode. Either anode or cathode is covered by a 
layer of dielectric materials such as quartz [19, 28]. In 
many plasma jet devices, the quartz hollow tube is used 
as the dielectric layer on the cathode [2, 29]. The metal 
cathode such as copper surrounds the quartz tube. In 
addition, the plasma jet device needs a carrying gas such 
as helium [18, 26, 30] or argon [25, 31, 32] to sustain the 
formation of CAP while the DBD device can generate the 
plasma directly in the air [20-22, 33]. In some applications, 
oxygen [4, 34] and nitrogen [35, 36] have been added 
in the carrying gas to achieve the specific chemical 
composition. Due to the continuous flow of the carrying 
gas, a CAP jet forms. On the other hand, the DBD device 
tends to generate a short but a wide plasma. Moreover, the 
functions of samples in the two cold plasma devices are 
also different. In the plasma jet device, the sample is just 
treated by the plasma jet [4, 18, 37]. On the other hand, in 
DBD device, the sample is a part of discharge [20, 22, 38]. 
The CAP in DBD will not be generated if the sample is not

adequately close to the second electrode. Based on these 
properties and features, the plasma jet device may be more 
suitable for gentlly treating a small area on a sample. In 
contrast, the DBD may be more suitable for a more intense 
treatment on a large area of sample. A recent review 
written by X. Lu, et al., comprehensively introduced the 
physical foundation of the reactive species generation in 
different CAP devices [39].
RESEARCH STATUS 
There exist a number of published reviews that 
discuss the application of CAP on cancer treatment [40-
44] [45]. In this review, we focused on introducing the 
basic concept of CAP and the biological basis of the anti￾cancer mechanism of CAP. Since the first report about the 
killing effect of DBD on melanoma in 2007, the field of 
CAP application in cancer treatment experienced a fast 
growth (Figure 3a). Through a comprehensive survey 
of all publications by September 2016, it is found that 
about 75% papers in this field were published in the 
multidisciplinary journals such as PLoS ONE, the applied 
physics-related journals such as Applied Physics Letters, 
as well as the plasma-related journals such as Plasma 
Processes and Polymers (Figure 3b). On the other hand, 
only about 25% papers were published in the life science 
& medicine-related journals. As a result, the research in 
this field is mainly focused on describing the anti-cancer 
effect of CAP treatment on different cancer cell lines [41, 
44] and tumors in animal models [20, 30, 46]. To date, 
the CAP treatment has demonstrated its significant anti￾cancer capacity over approximately 20 cancers types in 
vitro. Among these cancer cell lines, brain cancer [27, 
47, 48], skin cancer [2, 19, 49], breast cancer [50-52], 
colorectal cancer [15, 53, 54], lung cancer [18, 46, 55], 
cervical cancer [56-58], leukemia [23, 59, 60], hepatoma 
[25, 37, 58], as well as head & neck cancer [61-63] have 
been intensively investigated (Figure 3c). Moreover, about 
70% of the entire publications employed the plasma jet 
devices as the anti-cancer tools (Figure 3d). 
In addition to resisting the growth of cancer cells, 
CAP is also able to restore the sensitivity of chemo￾resistant cancer cells to specific drugs. One example is that 
CAP restored temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant glioblastoma 
cells to TMZ therapy [64]. Another example is that CAP 
made tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing 
ligand (TRAIL)-resistant colorectal cancer cells sensitive 
to the TRAIL treatment [65]. 
Moreover, CAP can obtain a stronger anti-cancer 
capacity through the synergistic application with 
nanoparticles technologies. M.G. Kong, et al. gave a 
detailed illustration in a review to describe the potential 
synergistic application of CAP and nanoparticles in 
medicine [66]. The enhanced anti-melanoma effect was 
first achieved using CAP to treat melanoma cancer cells 
which had been pretreated with the anti-FAK antibody￾conjugated gold nanoparticles [49]. Clearly, such surface￾modified nanoparticles weaken the normal function of 
FAK, which may intensify the CAP-triggering detachment 
of melanoma cells from the substrate. It was further 
demonstrated that the pretreatment of gold nanoparticles 
without the specific antibody modification also enhanced 
the anti-glioblastoma effect of the plasma jet [67]. A 
recent study demonstrated that the combined treatment 
of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated gold nanoparticles 
and CAP increased cancer cells death in solid tumors

and decreased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
[68]. In addition to using nanoparticles, drug encapsulated 
core-shell nanoparticles synthesized via co-axial 
electrospraying has also shown its synergistic anti-cancer 
potential with CAP on breast cancer cells [69]. These 
studies indicate that nanoparticles may weaken or damage 
the normal function of specific proteins or pathways, 
which resist the intracellular change due to the CAP￾originated reactive species. 
Two basic strategies of using CAP have been 
developed. One is to employ the plasma jet [25] or DBD 
[19] to directly treat the cells seeded in a petri dish or 
a multi-wells plate or the subcutaneous tumors in mice 
(Figure 4a). Another approach is to use the cold plasma￾stimulated solutions (PSA) mainly the cold plasma￾stimulated medium (PSM) to inhibit the growth of cancer 
cells during the standard cell culture process [47, 70] or 
to inhibit the growth of tumor tissues by injecting PSM 
into the tumor tissues of mice [71] (Figure 4b). PSM is 
also named cold plasma-activated medium (PAM). Most 
studies utilized the first method. Over past 3 years, the 
second approach is gradually becoming a hot topic [66, 
72-80]. In this review, we just discussed the former one. 
INTERACTION BETWEEN CAP AND 
BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM 
The interaction between CAP and cells in tissue or 
cells grown in a petri dish builds the foundation of the anti￾cancer effect of CAP. Such interaction is a combination 
of physical and chemical factors as shown schematically 
in Figure 5. Ultraviolet, heat, and electromagnetic field 
are physical factors in CAP. Chemical factors include 
dozens of reactive species that are generated in the gas 
phase of CAP. Among them, oxygen-based species such 
as hydroxyl (OH.) [5, 18, 50], singlet oxygen (1
O2
) [5, 35, 
50], superoxide (O2
.
-
) [5], hydrogen peroxide (H2
O2
) [5], 
ozone (O3
) [5, 60], as well as nitrogen-based species such 
as nitric oxide (NO) [5, 18, 36], nitrogen dioxide (NO2
) 
[60], nitrogen trioxide (NO3
) [60], nitrous oxide (N2
O) 
[60], and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2
O4
) [60] have been 
observed in CAP. In addition, positive charged ions such 
as N2
+
 [18, 37, 50] and electrons [5] are also generated by 
CAP. 
To date, most in vitro studies have focused on the 
anti-cancer effect of CAP on cancer cells cultured in a petri

dish or in a multi-well plate. When the CAP treatment 
performs, a layer of cell culture medium always covers 
the cancer cells. Thus, the above-mentioned physical and 
chemical factors will touch the medium first (Figure 5). 
The effect of ultraviolet, heat, as well as electromagnetic 
field on the medium is negligible. The slight increase in 
the temperature of medium after CAP treatment from room 
temperature to about 35°C is the only confirmed evidence 
of the physical effect of CAP on the medium [33, 81]. 
The final temperature of the medium is determined on its 
initial temperature, composition, the CAP treatment dose 
and the power of discharge [33, 81]. Because the standard 
temperature in the incubator is 37°C, the slightly warmed 
CAP-treated medium clearly will not inhibit the growth of 
cancer cell. In addition, ultraviolet and electrons in DBD 
have been proved to be negligible factors contributing to 
the intracellular DNA damage triggered by CAP [5]. Thus, 
the observed cellular response to CAP treatment in vitro
may be mainly due to various CAP-originated reactive 
species [9]. This may be the substantial difference between 
CAP and some conventional chemotherapy methods. 
The later may also generate intracellular ROS stress by 
different intracellular pathways. However, CAP itself is 
a tunable source of reactive species. The intracellular 
ROS stress is due to the specific combination of the CAP￾originated species. 
Despite the understanding on the solvation of 
plasma component into the aqueous solution is far from 
clear, two trends are observed. First, most components 
of the medium, in particular, amino acids dissolved in 
medium [82] and the amino acids in proteins [70] are 
modified after the CAP treatment. Among 20 amino 
acids, cysteine shows the strongest reactivity towards 
the plasma-originated reactive species dissolved in PSM 
though the mechanism is still remain disputable [70]. 
Second, several oxygen reactive species (ROS) such as 
H2
O2
 [33, 56, 83], and nitrogen reactive species (RNS) 
such as NO2
-
 [70, 84, 85] and ONOO-
 [86] have been

widely detected in PSM or other plasma-treated aqueous 
solutions. In addition, many authors conclude that NO 
has been formed in PSM [17, 56, 84]. However, only the 
concentration of NO2
-
 rather than directly NO [17, 52, 81] 
was measured. The NO2
-
 detected in medium may not be 
simply due to the oxidation of NO in medium, though it is 
the sole explanation currently to explain the slow increase 
of NO2
-
 in PSM during the storage [70, 85] . It is plausible 
to assume that NO2
-
 is formed as result of the unknown 
interaction between medium and CAP. Thus, though the 
existence of NO in gas phases of CAP has been widely 
recognized [5, 18, 36], the generation of NO in PSM has 
not been directly proven. 
THE ANTI-CANCER EFFECT OF CAP 
IN VIVO
To date, several investigations have used CAP to 
treat subcutaneous xenograft tumors [20, 27, 30, 62, 87, 
88] and melanoma in mice [89, 90]. All those studies 
achieved a similar result that the growth of tumor in vivo
was significantly halted by the CAP treatment on the 
skin of mice. For example, our study on a bladder tumor 
mouse xenograft through subcutaneous injection displays 
this effect [46] (Figure 6a). After 24 hours following a 2 
minutes of CAP treatment, the treated tumor significantly 
decreased in size and could not been observed on the skin 
of mice [46]. We have performed similar experiments on a 
murine melanoma model and found that tumor growth was 
completely inhibited over 3 weeks after the CAP treatment 
[46] (Figure 6b). Corresponding mice survival rates were 
also strongly increased compared with the control group 
without the CAP treatment [46]. A very recent study on the 
anti-melanoma effect of DBD further confirmed that the 
CAP-treated melanoma tissue completely disappeared at 
the 22rd day after the treatment [90]. 
The anti-cancer mechanism of CAP treatment in 
vivo is still an open question. Very recently, N. Gaur, et 
al., proved that H2
O2
, NO2
-
, and OH. could be generated 
in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) covered by a 1 
mm thick gelatin film which was directly touched by the 
plasma jet [91]. This result indicates that the diffusion 
of reactive species across the skin analogue is possible. 
However, other explanations have also been proposed. 
One promising candidate is that the CAP treatment 
activates the immune response in vivo to attack the tumor 
[92-94]. The macrophages can be activated in vitro by a 
uniform nanosecond pulsed DBD (nspDBD) and improves 
the healing effect at an artificial wound [94]. The uniform 
nspDBD also enhanced the anti-tumor effects through both 
the induction of immunogenic cell death in tumor cells 
Figure 5: Schematic illustration for the interaction between CAP and cells in vitro and in vivo. Abbreviations: E & M: 
electromagnetic field, UV: ultraviolet. The dissolved reactive oxygen/nitrogen species in the culture medium have been regarded as the 
main factor causing the death of cancer cells in vitro. However, the inhibited growth of subcutaneous tumor tissues through the treatment 
of CAP above the skin is still a puzzled question in plasma medicine.

and augmentation of macrophage’s function [93]. Vandana 
Miller, et al. provided a comprehensive introduction about 
the promising cancer immunotherapy based on the CAP 
treatment in a recent review [92]. By optimizing the 
parameters of CAP to induce immunogenic cell death in 
tumors locally, it is possible to trigger specific, protective 
immune responses systematically [92]. In addition to these 
direct CAP treatments, the anti-cancer capacity of PSM in 
vivo has also been confirmed by directly injecting PSM 
into the subcutaneous xenograft tumors in mice (Figure 
6c) [71]. 
Recent in vivo studies in a melanoma mice model 
demonstrated that reactive species such as ROS and RNS 
are the main factors contributing to the elimination of 
tumor by CAP [90]. However, it should be noted that the 
mechanism of action for CAP in vivo might be different 
from one in vitro. It was observed that just using the gel/
H2
O2
 mixture could not generate a tumor killing efficacy 
as significant as that of DBD on the melanoma in a mouse 
model [90]. In fact, the application of the gel/H2
O2
 mixture 
just slowed the tumor growth, but did not eliminate the 
tumor [90]. Reactive species other than H2
O2
 may also 
be involved in the interaction between CAP and the 
cancerous tissue. 
Several comments should be made regarding the 
physical factors such as radiation, thermal effect, as well 
as the electromagnetic field. Despite these physical factors 
being regarded as minor players for the anti-cancer effect 
of CAP in in vitro conditions, some effects might be 
expected in vivo when CAP directly treats skin or epithelial 
tissues. One recent study using a mouse xenograft model 
demonstrated that the increase of temperature on the CAP￾treated tumor tissue in vivo is negligible [90] confirming 
previous reports [46]. Though the contribution of electric 
field generated by CAP to the anti-cancer capacity of CAP 
was found to be small [90], further study of this effect 
and its importance is warranted [95]. Overall, the effect of 
physical and chemical factors on the in vivo application is 
still largely unknown.
THE ANTI-CANCER MECHANISM OF 
CAP IN VITRO
The chemical essence of the toxicity of CAP 
In most in vitro studies, cancer cells were immersed 
in a layer of cell culture medium during the CAP treatment 
[62, 96, 97]. As we mentioned above, this thin medium 
layer facilitates the transition of reactive species in gas 
phase into the reactive species dissolved in liquid phase 
[98]. Thus, the change in the CAP treated medium or PBS 
is the foundation to understand the chemical essence of 
CAP’s toxicity in vitro. Due to the existence of buffering 
chemicals in medium or in PBS, short time CAP treatment 
just causes a negligible change in pH of medium or PBS 
[33, 81]. Among diverse plasma-originated species, H2
O2 
has been proved to the main anti-cancer reactive species 
causing the death of cancer cells in vitro [37, 56, 72, 
73, 75-77, 81, 83, 99, 100]. Actually, the medium with 
adequately high concentration of H2
O2
 is toxic to various 
cells including cancer cells [101, 102]. But, the CAP 
treatment is not simply equal to the H2
O2
 treatment even 
just in in vitro studies. Synergistically using H2

generate an anti-cancer effect more close to that generated 
by the CAP treatment than just using the H2
O2
 containing 
medium or PBS [79, 103]. Nonetheless, RNS is a minor 
anti-cancer factor for in vitro studies [79, 103]. We have 
found that even the concentration of nitrite in medium 
increases to be 100 times stronger than that generated 
by the CAP treatment, the growth of glioblastoma cells, 
breast cancer cells, as well as pancreatic cancer cells will 
not be noticeably affected (unpublished results). 
The change of cellular membrane and shape 
To this end, primary understanding of the anti￾cancer mechanism of CAP is obtained from in vitro
studies. In this section, we present a summary based all 
references in this field by the end of 2015 (Figure 7). This 
summary does not tend to reflect the viewpoints of every 
researchers in this field, but to repesent the commonly 
acknowledged conclusions. 
The CAP-originated ROS and RNS (directly from 
CAP or subsequently formed in medium) first touch the 
cytoplasmic membrane. Shortly after the CAP treatment 
with an adequately high dose, many cancer cells 
experience a morphological change from spread shapes 
to contractive shapes [2, 38, 49]. We observed this trend 
just 1 hour after the CAP treatment (unpublished results). 
In the contractive shape, the horizonal polarization and 
cytoplasmic protrusions are lost [104]. In addition, due to 
the appearance of tiny protuburances on the CAP-treated 
Figure 7: A general summary for the anti-cancer mechanism of CAP in vitro based on publications by the end of 2015. 
Shortly, the CAP-originated reactive species will cause a noticeable rise of intracellular ROS, which weakens the intracellular anti-oxidant 
system and further causes serious DNA double-strand break. As a result, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis based on mitochondrion-pathway 
or tumor necrosis factor receptor-pathway occur. Abbreviations: ROS: reactive oxygen species, RNS: reactive nitrogen species, Nox:

cancer cells [105], the cancer cells have a rougher surface 
than the untreated cancer cells [104]. The change of cell 
shape is accompanied with the architecture change of the 
cytoskeleton such as F-actin [2, 104, 106]. CAP treatment 
also decreases the expression of integrin [2, 29, 53], focal 
adhesion kinase (FAK) [2], Src kinase (Src) [104], and 
Rho family including Rho and Rac [104], which causes 
the commonly observed phenomenon that the CAP-treated 
cancer cells’ migration rate will be decreased and the cells’ 
detachment rate will be increased [29, 52]. 
The transmembrane diffusion of reactive species 
The significance of channels or transporters located 
in the cellular membrane has not yet been investigated 
in plasma medicine. However, these membrane proteins 
may be a key to understand the cellular response to the 
CAP treatment. Since most of plasma-originated reactive 
species are either charged or polar molecules, specific 
channels and transporters on the cytoplasmic membrane 
are necessary for the transmembrane diffusion of these 
reactive species (Table 1). So far, only NO has been widely 
regarded as a freely-diffusing molecule among other 
Figure 8: The modified selective model based on the distinct expression of AQPs and catalase in cancer cells and 
normal cells. Cancer cells express more AQPs and less catalase than homologous normal cells in many cases.

CAP-originated reactive species [17]. In fact, ONOO-
 is 
also able to freely cross phospholipid membranes with a 
permeability coefficient 400 times greater than that of O2
-
[107], though some unknown anion channels may also be 
involved in its transmembrane diffusion [108]. Other polar 
or charged reactive species, such as H2
O2
, NO2
-
 [109], and 
NO3
-
 [109, 110], must need channels or transporters to 
finish their transmembrane diffusion process. Aquaporins 
(AQPs), was first discovered as a specific water channel 
[111]. Recently, the key function of AQPs family in the 
transmembrane diffusion of several small molecules 
such as H2
O2
, CO2
, NO, NH3
, urea, and even glycerol 
has been confirmed [112]. Within the AQPs family, AQP 
1, 3, 8, and 9 are the membrane channels facilitating 
the H2
O2
 transmembrane diffusion [113-116]. AQP 1 is 
even capable of facilitating the passive diffusion of NO 
across cell membranes [117]. Until recently, we first 
demonstrated the key function of AQP 8 in glioblastoma 
(U87MG) cells as the transmembrane diffusion channels 
of the cold plasma-originated H2
O2
. Silencing the 
expression of AQP 8 in U87MG cells significantly inhibits 
the anti-cancer capacity of the cold plasma-stimulated 
medium (unpublished results). Thus, AQPs may play be a 
key factor in the anti-cancer capacity of CAP particularly 
in terms of the transmembrane diffusion of the plasma￾originated H2
O2
 [115]. Even while some authors proposed 
that the increased intracellular ROS was due to secondary 
products such as H2
O2
 from the plasma-activated NADPH 
oxidases (Nox) on the cytoplasmic membrane [53], the 
transmembrane diffusion of such secondary H2
O2
 is also 
rely on relied on AQPs [114, 118]. 
The rise of intracellular reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and redox balance 
Significant rise of intracellular ROS is the most 
common response of the CAP-treated cells [119] 
including cancer cells [18, 120], normal untransformed 
mammalian cells [5, 18], and yeast cells [34]. Oxidant￾sensitive fluorescent dye 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein 
diacetate (H2
DCFDA) is the most common intracellular 
ROS probes in this field [17, 22, 27, 56, 71, 120]. Because 
H2
DCFDA is not a specific ROS probe, the chemical 
essence of increased intracellular ROS is still unknown. 
Nonetheless, many researchers proposed that H2
O2
[56, 100, 120], OH. [51], and O2
-
 [81] were the main 
increased intracellular ROS in the CAP-treated cells. 
The significance of the increased intracellular ROS in 
the anti-cancer capacity of CAP has been widely verified 
through the observation that CAP cannot resist the growth 
of cancer cells if these cells have been pretreated with 
intracellular ROS scavengers such as N-Acetyl-Cysteine 
(NAC) [22, 27, 120], D-mannitol [120], rotenome 
[18], and apocynin [18]. For the normal untransformed 
mammalian cells, the pretreatment with NAC is also able 
to completely resist DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) 
due to CAP [5]. The origin of the increased intracellular 
ROS is still disputable. Most authors concur that it due to 
the diffusion of extracellular CAP-originated ROS across 
the cytoplasmic membrane [17, 18, 27]. This explanation 
is consistent with the observation that intracellular ROS 
rises just 5 min after the CAP treatment [17, 22]. Recently, 
Nox on the cytoplasmic membrane was found to cause 
the rise of intracellular ROS and the decreased viability 
of colorectal cancer cells after the CAP treatment [53]. 
The CAP-originated reactive species may just activate 
the expression of Nox2 in cancer cells but do not directly 
enter the cytoplasm [53]. Nox may generate secondary 
ROS such as superoxide, which further inhibits the cell 
growth [53]. Thus, the intracellular ROS may be partially 
due to the secondary ROS originated from oxidase on the 
cell cytoplasm membrane. 
The disturbance on the intracellular redox balance 
is inhibited by diverse anti-oxidant systems, including 
small molecules such as glutathione (GSH), reduced 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) 
and ROS-scavenging enzymes such as superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), peroxiredoxin [121], catalase, 
thioredoxin reductase [122, 123], and glutathione 
reductase [124]. The rise of intracellular ROS will 
consume and weaken the inherent anti-oxidant system in 
cytoplasm. GSH, the most abundant small molecular thiol 
in mammalian cells [125], is an example. The reduced 
form of GSH is a tripeptide with a middle cysteine residue. 
Oxidation of the cysteine redisue forms a disulfide bond 
with a cysteine residue on another GSH. GSSG is used to 
denote the oxidized state of GSH [125]. The decreased 
GSH/GSSG ratio and NADPH/NADP+
 ratio have been 
observed in the CAP-treated cancer cell lines [37, 96]. In 
addition, decreased expression of catalase [37], SOD [37], 
and peroxiredoxin (Prx) [126] has also been observed after 
the CAP treatment. Clearly, the weakened intracellular 
anti-oxidant system will facilitate the rise of intracellular 
ROS. 
DNA damage and apoptosis pathways
In the CAP-treated melanoma cells, the tumor 
necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-based apoptosis pathway 
has been activated by the rise of intracellular ROS [127]. 
Similar apoptosis pathways have also been detected in the 
CAP-treated head and neck cancer cells [62]. However, 
most apoptosis pathways observed in the CAP-treated 
cancer cells is based on the mitochondrial pathway 
triggered by DNA damage and mitochondrial damage. 
DNA damage has been commonly observed as an early 
stage event upon the CAP treatment [44, 119]. DSB is the 
main damage style [27, 36, 64]. An important marker of 
DSB is a specific phosphorylation on serine 139 on H2AX 
histone (γ-H2AX), which has been commonly observed 
shortly after the CAP treatment [5, 27, 36, 38]. The serine 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 15987 Oncotarget
139 on H2AX is phosphorylated by ataxia telangiectasia 
mutated (ATM) recruited on the DSB site with other DNA 
damage response complexes [108, 128]. The enhanced 
expression of ATM has been observed in the CAP-treated 
oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma cells [129]. The 
activated monomeric ATM can phosphorylate p53 and 
other substrate in the DNA damage response complexes 
localized at DSB sites [129]. Phosphorylation of p53 (p￾p53) has been observed in the CAP-treated oral cavity 
squamous cell carcinoma cells [129], and melanoma cells 
[130]. In addition, the increased expression of p-p53 in 
the CAP-treated mouse melanoma cells (B16F10) is 
just followed by the expression γ-H2AX [38], which 
provides clues to understand the chronological order of 
pathways. Moreover, ATM may also phosphorylate p73, 
which further activates the expression of pro-apoptotic 
factors [108]. The significant enhanced expression of p73 
in the CAP-treated melanoma (Me1007) cells has been 
observed [131]. The knockout of p73 gene in Me1007 
cells noticeably reduces the anti-cancer capacity of CAP 
[131]. 
The phosphorylation of p53 is a necessary step for 
a series of downstream cell cycle arrest pathways [108, 
128]. The activation of p21 expression by p53 has been 
confirmed in diverse CAP-treated cancer cell lines [129, 
130]. The activated p21 further triggers the different types 
of cell cycle arrests [132]. In the CAP-treated oral cavity 
squamous cell carcinoma cells, p21 inhibits the function 
of cyclin D1, causing noticeable sub-G1 arrest [129]. In 
the CAP-treated melanoma cells, p21 triggers G2/M arrest 
by an unknown pathway [130]. G2/M cell cycle arrest has 
also been observed in several other cold plasma-treated 
cancer cells [64, 133, 134], though the corresponding 
mechanism is unknown. 
Moreover, phosphorylation of p53 is also necessary 
for triggering the mitochondrion-based apoptosis pathways 
[132]. p53 activates the expression of pro-apoptotic 
factors, such as Bax, PUMA, and NOXA [132]. These pro￾apoptotic factors finally cause the release of cytochrome c 
and other intermembrane mitochondrial proteins into the 
cytosol [135, 136], where cytochrome c binds to apoptotic 
protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and finally forms 
apoptosome [137]. The apoptosome further activates 
caspase-9 by cleavage [138, 139]. The activated caspase-9 
further activates caspase-3/7 [138, 140] and finally starts 
a series of apoptotic events [138]. Among them, the 
cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) is an 
important early molecular marker of apoptosis [138]. 
Apoptosis is the main type of cancer cell death following 
the CAP treatment [43, 44, 119]. In the CAP-treated cancer 
cells, the release of cytochrome c into cytosol [38], the 
expression of NOXA [141], Bax [142], caspase-9 [143], 
caspase-3/7 [38, 47, 62, 130], the cleavage of PARP [31, 
64], the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential 
[33, 38, 62, 96, 120], as well as DNA fragmentation [60] 
have been commonly observed. In short, the CAP-treated 
cancer cells not only follows the typical DNA damage 
pathways [108, 128], but also follows the well understood 
apoptosis pathways [144]. 
Selective anti-cancer mechanism 
In contrast to most anti-cancer methods such as 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the primary advantage 
of CAP is its selective anti-cancer capacity, which has 
been demonstrated over dozens of cancer cell lines 
[119]. Under the same experimental conditions, CAP 
tends to resist the growth of cancer cells rather than the 
growth of homologous normal cells [119] by triggering 
more apoptosis in cancer cells than normal cells [15, 
16, 55]. Understanding such a selective anti-cancer 
mechanism is one of the key challenges in this field. 
Such a selective effect may be mainly due to the widely 
observed phenomenon that the noticeable rise of ROS 
selectively occurs in cancer cells rather than normal cells 
upon the same CAP treatment [18, 53, 96, 127, 145]. 
The measured ROS level in cancer cells is higher than 
that in normal cells after the CAP treatment [18, 53, 96, 
127, 145]. Nonetheless, CAP kills more cancer cells than 
homologous normal cells in a few cases [133, 146]. 
To explain the observed trend, two models have 
been proposed. The first model proposes that such a 
different rise of ROS in the normal and cancerous tissue 
is due to different basal intracellular ROS levels between 
cancer cells and normal cells [9, 44]. Due to stronger 
metabolism in cancer cells, the basal ROS level in cancer 
cells is thought to be higher than that in normal cells 
[147-150]. When additional ROS stress such as the CAP￾originated reactive species is exerted on cells, the whole 
intracellular ROS in cancer cells will pass a threshold 
more easily than that in normal cells [9, 44]. As a result, 
cancer cells experience more apoptosis than normal cells 
upon the CAP treatment [119]. However, this basal-ROS 
level model can just explain the appearance of higher ROS 
level in the CAP-treated cancer cells, but cannot explain 
the selective rise of ROS in cancer cells. 
Recently, a novel model based on AQPs the only 
verified H2
O2
 channels on the cytoplasmic membrane has 
been proposed in a review [119]. Cancer biologists confirm 
that most cancer tissues tend to express more AQPs on 
their cytoplasmic membranes than homologous normal 
tissues [151]. After the CAP treatment, CAP-originated 
H2
O2
 diffuses into cancer cells significantly faster than 
homologous normal cells, causing a significantly higher 
rise of ROS in cancer cells than normal cells [119]. 
Despite the direct evidence for this model is still lacking, 
two indirect evidences support our proposition. First, the 
uptake of H2
O2
 in mammalian HEK 293 cells, human 
colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cells, as well as cervical 
cancer HeLa cells can be significantly increased by 
expression of AQP 3 on cellular membrane [114]. Second, 
the yeast cells expressing AQP 8 and AQP 1 show a 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 15988 Oncotarget
much stronger resistance to H2O2 solution than the yeast 
cells do not express them [115]. Such different H2
O2 
consumption capacity between cancer cells and normal 
cells may be the foundation of the selective anti-cancer 
mechanism of CAP. The AQPs-based model not only 
explains the observed selective rise of ROS in cancer cells, 
but also explain our recent observation that glioblastoma 
cells tend to consume H2O2 in medium significantly faster 
than astrocytes [119]. It is necessary to emphasize that 
based on the AQPs-based model, the selective anti-cancer 
capacity of CAP treatment is not necessary to be exist. 
If cancer cells express less AQP 1, 3, 8, and 9 less than 
corresponding homologous normal cells, CAP may kill the 
cancer cells without selectivity or even kill more normal 
cells than cancer cells. 
In addition to these models, an observation based 
on the correlation between the expression of p53 and the 
sensitivity of cancer cell lines to the CAP treatment has 
been reported [84]. It was found that the cells including 
cancer cells and normal cells expressing p53 gene were 
more resistant to the CAP treatment than cancer cells 
without p53 gene [84]. Before this finding, another trend 
that the cancer cells with a higher proliferation rate are 
more sensitive to the CAP treatment than the cancer cells 
with a lower proliferation rate has also been observed 
[106]. Loss of p53 is a key step during the tumorigenesis 
[75]. Many tumors in the high tumorigenic stage tend to 
lose p53 [75]. In addition, the cancer cells from a high 
tumorigenic stage tend to express more AQP than the 
cancer cells from a low tumorigenic stage. For example, 
the expression of AQP 8 in glioblastoma (grade IV 
astrocytoma) cells is higher than that in grade I, II, and III 
astrocytoma [152]. Though the direct correlation between 
the expression of p53 and AQPs has not been demonstrated 
in cancer biology, the AQPs-based model can theoretically 
explain the correlation between the expression level of 
p53 and the sensitivity of cancer cells to CAP. Simply, the 
cancer cells without p53 may tend to express more AQPs, 
making the cancer cells without p53 consume the CAP￾originated reactive species such as H2O2 faster than the 
cancer cells with p53. This hypothesis might serve as a 
foundation for the p53-CAP sensitivity correlation. 
The intracellular anti-oxidant system may also 
contribute to the selective anti-cancer mechanism, 
though the direct evidence is still lacking. The balance 
between the entrance of extracellularly originated ROS 
and the resistance from the intracellular anti-oxidant 
system determines the change of intracellular ROS [153, 
154]. As mentioned above, the intracellular anti-oxidant 
systems include a series of enzymes such as catalase, 
superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, glutathione 
peroxidase as well as small molecules such as GSH and 
NADPH [155]. A very recent study demonstrated that the 
decreased expression and the enhanced expression of Cu, 
Zn-SOD or Mn-SOD enhanced and decreased the plasma￾induced HeLa cell death, respectively [156]. Expression 
of exogenous catalase also blocked HeLa cell death [156]. 
Thus, a high expression of the intracellular anti-oxidant 
system may also weaken the anti-cancer capacity of CAP. 
Some specific anti-oxidant enzymes in cancer cell lines are 
indeed expressed less than corresponding normal cell lines 
[147]. Take the catalase as an example, its expression in 
cancer cells are less than the corresponding normal cells in 
many studies [147, 157-160]. However, a comprehensive 
review pointed out that the expression of catalase in other 
cancer cell line such as human H2
O2
-resistant HL-60 
promyelocytic leukemia cell lines is higher than normal 
cell line [157]. The expression of catalase in gastric 
carcinoma cells is also higher than their non-cancerous 
counterparts [161]. Actually, even the conclusion that 
the cancer cells have weaker anti-oxidant systems than 
normal cells are still disputable in cancer biology [148]. 
For example, a strong Mn-SOD expression occurs in high￾grade and advanced-stage bladder tumors [162]. In short, 
the selective anti-cancer capacity of CAP may be due to 
the combined effect of multiple cellular factors, such as 
the enhanced expression of AQPs as well as the decreased 
expression of specific anti-oxidant enzymes such as 
catalase in cancer cells (Figure 8). 
OUTLOOK
The application of CAP in the cancer treatment have 
been initiated just about 8 years ago. Thus, this is a very 
young field. So far, the research mainly focuses on the 
description of the anti-cancer effect of CAP in vitro and 
in vivo. The understanding of the anti-cancer mechanism 
is very limited. To become a mature anti-cancer treatment 
modality with a solid theoretical foundation, the basic 
mechanism needs to be addressed. There are many key 
questions have not been answered or even mentioned in 
this field. What is the essence of the selective anti-cancer 
capacity of CAP and what are the distinct cellular and 
molecular responses between cancer cells and normal cells 
to the CAP treatment? Similarly, which cancer subtypes 
are more or less sensitive to the CAP treatment? Can 
we find some general cellular and molecular features or 
markers to describe such killing selectivity? If we know 
the mechanism of such a distinction, can we enhance such 
a selectivity by controlling the chemical factors such as 
species generation as well as the physical factors such as 
the discharge in the CAP device? What is the contribution 
of physical factors such as the electromagnetic field to the 
anti-cancer capacity of CAP? In addition, for the clinical 
application, understanding the anti-cancer performance of 
CAP in animals is a key challenge. How to understand 
the inhibited growth of subcutaneous tumors just by a 
CAP treatment just above the skin? What is the potential 
toxicity of CAP? Can we eliminate the toxicity by 
optimizing CAP devices? What is the advantage of CAP 
compared with other existing treatment modalities? In our 
opinion, satisfactory answers to these questions will help

CAP to become a practical anti-cancer tool. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In summary, CAP shows its promising potential to 
be a selective anti-cancer tool. Preliminary research over 
the past decade demonstrated that CAP could effectively 
inhibit the growth of dozens of cancer cell lines in vitro
by mainly triggering apoptosis. CAP is also capable 
of effectively resisting the growth of subcutaneously 
implanted xenograft tumors in mice by unknown 
mechanism. The CAP-originated reactive species has 
been regarded as the primary factors resulting in cell 
death though physical factors of CAP may also has minor 
unknown functions. Despite the anti-cancer molecular 
mechanism is still far from clear, current studies reveal 
that the apoptosis of CAP-treated cancer cells in vitro is 
mainly due to the intense DNA double-strand break caused 
by a significant rise of intracellular ROS. The differential 
expression of the aquaporin channels and intracellular 
anti-oxidant enzymes such as catalases in cancer cells 
and normal cells may be a plausible mechanism to control 
the selective diffusion of reactive species across the 
cytoplasmic membrane of cancer cells and selective rise of 
intracellular ROS in cancer cells. Because corresponding 
homologous normal cells just experience a weak rise of 
ROS, CAP is able to selectively cause apoptosis in cancer 
cells in vitro.
