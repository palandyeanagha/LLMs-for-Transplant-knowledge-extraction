ABSTRACT
Background: Aberrant epithelial repair is a key event in
the airway remodelling which characterises obliterative
bronchiolitis (OB) in the transplanted lung. The potential
for airway epithelium from lung transplant recipients to
undergo epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition (EMT)
was assessed in culture and in vivo in lung allograft
tissue.
Methods: Change in epithelial and mesenchymal marker
expression was assessed after stimulation with trans￾forming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1) alone or in combination
with tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa) and compared with
untreated controls. The ability of cells to deposit
extracellular matrix, secrete matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) and invade collagen was investigated.
Immunolocalisation of epithelial and mesenchymal mar￾kers was compared in airway tissue from stable recipients
and those with OB.
Results: Untreated cells maintained epithelial morphology
and phenotype. TGF-b1 reduced expression of epithelial
markers, increased expression of vimentin and fibronectin,
promoted collagen I and fibronectin deposition and
increased MMP-9 production. Co-treatment with TNFa
dramatically accentuated phenotypic and some functional
features of EMT. Airway epithelial biopsies from recipients
with OB demonstrated significantly increased staining for
mesenchymal markers and significantly reduced E￾cadherin staining compared with stable recipients.
Conclusions: These observations demonstrate the ability
of human airway epithelium to undergo EMT and suggest
this phenomenon may be a potential link between
inflammatory injury and TGF-b1-driven airway remodelling
in the development of OB.
Lung transplantation provides a valuable therapeu￾tic option for selected patients with end-stage lung
disease.1 However, long-term survival remains
limited to a median of 5 years by the development
of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).2 The
pathological lesion of BOS is obliterative bronch￾iolitis (OB), which is characterised by aberrant
epithelial repair and airway remodelling leading to
obstruction due to deposition of extracellular
matrix (ECM) as a result of an excessive fibro￾blastic response.
The origin of the fibroblasts responsible for the
deposition of ECM remains unclear, with in situ
proliferation of resident fibroblasts and recruit￾ment of circulating progenitor cells proposed as
potential sources.3 Evidence from animal models of
airway obliteration suggests epithelial injury and,
importantly, a failure to re-establish an intact
epithelium may be critical to the pathogenesis.4
Epithelial cells can respond to injury in a number
of ways including repair, necrosis and apoptosis.
However, epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) is increasingly recognised as an alternative
response to injury. During EMT, cells lose epithe￾lial properties and gain properties of mesenchymal
cells including production of matrix metalloprotei￾nases (MMPs) and deposition of ECM.5 Recent
data from animal models and epithelial cell lines
suggest that EMT may be an important response in
lung epithelium at the alveolar level,6–9 however
data using primary human lung epithelium has
been limited to one previous pilot study.10
Transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1) is
implicated in driving fibrosis in the lung, liver
and kidney, but a mechanism by which TGF-b1
may contribute to the pathogenesis of OB remains
to be elucidated. Previous studies have shown
that TGF-b1 expression is increased in recipients
with OB11–14 and, in an animal model of airway
obliteration, interrupting TGF-b1 binding to its
receptor reduced intraluminal airway matrix
deposition.15
TGF-b1 signals predominantly via the SMAD
signalling pathway,16–18 but can also activate the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) path￾way.19–21 However, activation of the MAPK signal￾ling pathway by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as
tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa)
22 raises the
possibility of cross-talk between TGF-b1 signalling
and inflammatory signalling in epithelium. EMT
may therefore provide a plausible link between
excessive inflammation, TGF-b1 activity and the
development of OB. We hypothesise that airway
epithelial cells in the transplanted lung may
undergo TGF-b1-driven EMT and that this may
be exaggerated by pro-inflammatory stimuli such
as TNFa.
We have previously demonstrated preliminary
evidence of EMT in the airways of lung transplant
recipients by showing increased expression of the
single mesenchymal marker S100A4 in airway
epithelium from stable lung allografts.10 This study
aims to extend these initial observations by
comprehensively assessing the ability of airway
epithelial cells from lung transplant recipients to
undergo EMT and evaluating the evidence for EMT
in tissue sections from stable lung transplant
recipients and those with OB.

Cell culture
Primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) from stable lung
transplant recipients were isolated as previously described (see
online supplement for details).23
Cell treatments
Cells were cultured in media alone or treated with TGF-b1 (0.1–
20 ng/ml) and/or TNFa (1–20 ng/ml) for 72 h. Protein con￾centrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit
(Perbio Science, Northumberland UK).
Western blotting
Total cell lysates (5–60 mg) were separated on 4–12% bis-Tris
gels (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies and detected with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-labelled IgG conjugates (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
Antibody complexes were visualised using the SuperSignal
West Pico chemiluminescent kit (Perbio Science). Results are
normalised to b-tubulin.
Immunofluorescence
Cells fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde or explanted lung
tissue were incubated with primary antibodies and detected
using an appropriate fluorochrome-linked secondary antibody.
DAPI was used as a nuclear counterstain. Images acquired using
a LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope.
Gelatin zymography
MMP-9 activity in conditioned media from cells were analysed
as previously described (see online supplement for details).10
Invasion assay
The invasive potential of cells was evaluated by assessing
penetration of Matrigel coated filters. Briefly, cells were treated
with TGF-b1 (10 ng/ml) and/or TNFa (20 ng/ml) for 72 h,
10 000 cells loaded in the invasion chamber and incubated for
24 h at 37uC. The number of invasive cells was determined
following Diff-Quik (Dade Behring, Milton Keynes, UK)
staining and scored at bright field microscopy.
Trichloroacetic protein precipitation
Proteins secreted from the cells in to the culture media were
assessed by trichloroacetic (TCA) protein precipitation. Briefly,
250 ml TCA (100% w/v) was added to 1 ml of culture media and
incubated at 4uC for 10 min. The protein precipitate was then
pelleted by centrifuging at 14 000 rpm for 5 min. The protein
pellet was washed twice in 200 ml cold acetone and dried by
heating to 95uC for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended and
separated under denaturing conditions by SDS-PAGE.
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and
detected as previously described.
Human lung tissue sampling
Sequential sections from stable recipients, OB recipients and
normal control lungs were stained with antibodies against E￾cadherin, vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) using a
modified immunoperoxidase method (Envision; Dako, Ely, UK).
The extent of the area of positive bronchial epithelial staining
was assessed in five non-overlapping high power fields as
previously reported (see online supplement for details).24
Statistical analysis
The response of cultured cells from each subject to TGF-b1,
TNFa and TGF-b1 with TNFa were compared with their
untreated control cells. Changes in protein expression and
protein secretion (relative band density) and numbers of
invasive cells were quantified relative to untreated controls
and expressed as mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)).
The differences in EMT marker expression in control, stable
and BOS affected individuals were quantified for each marker
by averaging the percentage positive staining area in five high
power fields of intact epithelium for each individual. Results are
presented as mean (SEM).
The significance of differences between groups was assessed
by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS 14.0.
Differences with a p value of ,0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Characteristics of patient groups
Cultures of PBECs were obtained from five male lung transplant
recipients with stable allograft function between 6 and
30 months after transplantation. All subjects showed no
evidence of acute rejection (grade A2 or above by ISHLT
classification) or infection and were BOS stage 0 (.90% baseline
forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FEV1).
Transbronchial biopsies were obtained from six lung transplant
recipients (five men, one woman) with stable allograft function
between 6 and 12 months after transplantation. All subjects
showed no evidence of acute rejection or infection and were BOS
stage 0. Biopsies of OB affected lung were obtained from eight
lung transplant recipients (three men, five women) undergoing
retransplantation for advanced BOS stage 3 (,40% baseline FEV1)
between 32 and 116 months after their first transplant. Normal
control lung tissue was obtained from six unused donor lungs.
Effect of TGF-b1 and TNFa on epithelial cell morphology and
protein expression
Untreated or TNFa treated cells maintained a uniform ‘‘cobble￾stone’’ appearance characteristic of epithelial cells (fig 1A(i) and
(iii), respectively). The cells demonstrated high expression of the
epithelial marker cytokeratin 19 (fig 1A(v) and (vii)) and little or
no expression of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin (fig 1A(ix)
and (xi)) or vimentin (fig 1A(xiii) and (xv)). TGF-b1 treatment
markedly changed the cell phenotype to a more elongated bipolar
phenotype characteristic of mesenchymal cells (fig 1A(ii)). This
morphological change was associated with a downregulation in
cytokeratin-19 expression (fig 1A(vi)) and an upregulation in
fibronectin (fig 1A(x)) and vimentin (fig 1A(xiv)) expression. Co￾treatment of the cells with TGF-b1 and TNFa dramatically
accentuated the phenotype change (fig 1A(iv)) and further
increased the expression of fibronectin (fig 1A(xii)) and vimentin
(fig 1A(xvi)) compared with TGF-b1 alone.
Western blotting was used to quantify the changes in protein
expression (fig 1B). Untreated cells expressed high levels of E￾cadherin but little vimentin or fibronectin. Treatment with
TGF-b1 induced a statistically significant downregulation in E￾cadherin expression (p,0.001, n = 5) and a marked increase in
fibronectin (p,0.001, n = 5) and vimentin (p = 0.01, n = 5)
expression compared with untreated cells. Co-treatment of the
cells with TGF-b1 and TNFa induced a statistically significant
change in protein expression compared with TGF-b1 alone (E￾cadherin p = 0.006, n = 5; fibronectin p,0.001, n = 5; vimentin
p = 0.005, n = 5). Treatment of the epithelial cells with TNFa

alone had no effect on protein expression compared with
untreated cells (E-cadherin p = 0.168, n = 5; vimentin p = 0.977,
n = 5; fibronectin p = 0.624, n = 5).
Effect of TGF-b1 and TNFa concentrations on EMT marker
expression
The effect of increasing concentrations of TGF-b1 (0.1–20 ng/
ml) on the production of pro-MMP-9 was assessed using gelatin
zymography. Control cells and cells treated with 0.1 ng/ml
TGF-b1 secrete little or no pro-MMP-9 depending on the cell
donor. However, cells treated with .1 ng/ml TGF-b1 secrete
pro-MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner (fig 2A). The accent￾uating effects of TNFa on EMT were further evaluated using
lower doses of TGF-b1 (1 ng/ml and 3 ng/ml). A higher dose of
TNFa (20 ng/ml) is required to accentuate EMT in the presence
of a low dose of TGF-b1 (1 ng/ml) but, if the dose of TGF-b1 is
increased to 3 ng/ml (fig 2B) or 10 ng/ml (fig 2C), a dramatic
accentuating effect is achieved with as little as 1 ng/ml TNFa.
Effect of TGF-b1 and TNFa on the invasive potential of epithelial
cells
To determine whether airway epithelial cells are undergoing true
functional EMT, their ability to penetrate a Matrigel-coated filter
was investigated (fig 3A). Very few untreated cells penetrated the
Matrigel filter (mean (SEM) 61 (28.4)), but the number of invasive
cells increased following treatment with TGF-b1 compared with
untreated cells (284 (38.7), p = 0.012, n = 5). TNFa alone had no
effect on the number of invasive cells compared with untreated
cells (84 (38.7), p = 0.672, n = 5). Co-treatment of the cells with
TGF-b1 and TNFa significantly increased the number of invasive
cells compared with TGF-b1 alone (514 (51.6), p = 0.037, n = 5).
The effect of TGF-b1, in the presence or absence of TNFa, on
the production of pro-MMP-9 was assessed using gelatin
zymography (fig 3B). Control cells secrete a low level of pro￾MMP-9 that is increased by treatment with TGF-b1 (p = 0.007,
n = 5). Co-treatment with TNFa further increased the secretion
of pro-MMP-9 compared with cells treated with TGF-b1 alone
(p,0.001, n = 5).
Effect of TGF-b1 and TNFa on deposition of ECM by epithelial
cells
Cells treated with TNFa do not significantly increase secretion
of collagen type I (p = 0.446, n = 5) or fibronectin (p = 0.990,
n = 5) compared with untreated cells as assessed by TCA
precipitation (fig 3C). However, TGF-b1 treatment induces a
statistically significant increase in the secretion of collagen type

bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) from the transplanted lung. (A) PBECs left untreated (i) or treated with TNFa (iii) maintain the characteristic
‘‘cobblestone’’ appearance of epithelial cells, express cytokeratin-19 (v and vii) but express little to no fibronectin (ix and xi) or vimentin (xiii and xv).
Cells treated with TGF-b1 begin to lose cell-cell contact and adopt an elongated phenotype (ii), downregulate cytokeratin-19 expression (vi) and
increase fibronectin (x) and vimentin (xiv) expression. Co-treatment of the cells with TGF-b1 and TNFa induces a more dramatic change in phenotype
(iv) and further downregulated the expression of cytokeratin 19 (viii) and upregulated fibronectin (xii) and vimentin (xvi) expression compared with TGF￾b1 alone. All images shown at 663 magnification. (B) Untreated cells and cells treated with TNFa express high levels of E-cadherin but little to no
fibronectin or vimentin (lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Cells treated with TGF-b1 downregulate E-cadherin expression and upregulate fibronectin and
vimentin expression (lane 2). Cells treated with TGF-b1 and TNFa further downregulate E-cadherin expression and upregulate fibronectin and vimentin
expression compared with TGF-b1 alone (lane 4). All experiments repeated in five individual cell donors.

I (p,0.001, n = 5) and fibronectin (p,0.001, n = 5) compared
with untreated cells. Interestingly, co-treatment of the cells
with TGF-b1 and TNFa had no statistically significant effect on
the secretion of fibronectin (p = 0.156, n = 5) but significantly
decreased the secretion of collagen type I (p = 0.004, n = 5)
compared with TGF-b1 alone.
Expression of markers of EMT in vivo in airway epithelium
Biopsies were subjected to immunolocalisation studies for E￾cadherin (fig 4A(i)–(iii)), a-SMA (fig 4A(iv)–(vi)) and vimentin
(fig 4A(vii)–(ix)). The percentage of airway epithelium staining
positive for each marker was quantified and compared with
non-transplanted control lungs (fig 4B). Epithelium from
normal control tissue was highly positive for E-cadherin (mean
(SEM) 68.53 (2.54)%, n = 6) but expressed little a-SMA (6.69
(2.28)%, n = 6) or vimentin (2.05 (0.54)%, n = 6). Epithelium
from stable transplant recipients showed a statistically sig￾nificant decrease in E-cadherin expression (51.81 (2.28)%,
p = 0.004, n = 6) and increase in vimentin expression (6.42
(0.77)%, p = 0.009, n = 6) compared with control tissue. a-SMA
expression was not significantly different in the epithelium of
stable transplant recipients compared with normal epithelium
(4.89 (2.43)%, p = 0.657, n = 6). Epithelium in explanted lung
tissue from patients with BOS showed a statistically significant
decrease in E-cadherin expression (40.06 (3.98)%, p = 0.017,
n = 8) and a statistically significant increased expression of a￾SMA (21.21 (4.34)%, p = 0.008, n = 8) and vimentin (12.61
(2.32)%, p = 0.035, n = 8) compared with epithelium in both
normal tissue and stable recipients.
To further evaluate EMT in vivo, lung tissue from patients
with BOS was analysed for co-expression of E-cadherin and a￾SMA or S100A4. Figure 5A shows an area of intact airway
epithelium with clear E-cadherin expression at the junction
between cells. In a number of the cells expressing E-cadherin we
also see the expression of the early marker of EMT, S100A4 (see
arrows), showing that these cells co-express both epithelial and
mesenchymal markers. By comparison, in a more damaged area
of epithelium (fig 5B) we see that E-cadherin, although still
present, is reduced in intensity and very differently distributed
throughout the cell. Furthermore, certain cells in the damaged

expression (lane 4). Cells treated with 3 ng/ml of TGF-b1 downregulate E-cadherin expression and upregulate fibronectin and pro-MMP-9 expression
(lane 5). Addition of TNFa at 1 ng/ml downregulates E-cadherin expression and upregulates fibronectin and pro-MMP-9 expression (lane 6). Addition of
20 ng/ml TNFa further upregulates pro-MMP-9 expression but has no effect on E-cadherin and fibronectin expression (lane 7). (C) Untreated cells
express high levels of E-cadherin but little to no fibronectin, vimentin or pro-MMP-9 (lane 1). Cells treated with TGF-b1 at 10 ng/ml downregulate E￾cadherin expression and upregulate fibronectin, vimentin and pro-MMP-9 expression (lane 2). Addition of TNFa induces a dose-dependent decrease in
E-cadherin expression and a dose-dependent increase in fibronectin, vimentin and pro-MMP-9 expression (lanes 3–5).

DISCUSSION
In this study we have adopted a multifunctional approach to
identification of EMT ex vivo using cell morphology, upregula￾tion of mesenchymal proteins, downregulation of epithelial
proteins, secretion of ECM and a functional assessment of
invasive and migratory capacity. This multifunctional approach
is likely to be much more robust than reliance on any single
marker of EMT. In addition, our quantitative immunohisto￾chemistry has demonstrated reduced epithelial E-cadherin
expression and increases in vimentin and a-SMA expression in
the airway epithelium of patients with BOS compared with
stable recipients and control lung samples.
The results of this study add significantly to the under￾standing gained from our previously reported pilot observations
in the lung transplant airway.10 The present study provides a
comprehensive assessment of the ability of airway epithelial
cells from the transplanted lung to undergo EMT. Our
observations offer significant insight into what might be an
important mechanism in the development of OB. The hypo￾thesis that EMT represents a common final pathway in the
development of airway remodelling after lung transplantation is
attractive. It could explain why a broad range of insults, both
alloimmune and non-alloimmune, could produce a similar
pathological end point.
TGF-b1 has been widely implicated in driving fibrosis in a
variety of organs such as the liver and kidney, but a mechanism
by which this may occur in OB has not been fully elucidated. It
has been previously observed that TGF-b1 expression is
increased in patients with OB.11–14 In addition, studies in the
rodent heterotrophic tracheal transplant models of OB have
shown that interrupting TGF-b1 binding to its receptor or
inhibiting its downstream signalling via the SMAD pathway
reduces intraluminal airway matrix deposition.15
It is well recognised in clinical practice that BOS is often first
diagnosed or progresses more rapidly following a significant
episode of airway injury such as a viral or bacterial infection,
and these sources of acute inflammation in the transplant
airway may be very important in accentuating the process
already driving OB. It has been previously suggested that
repeated injury and persistent inflammation in the epithelium
coinciding with defective regeneration is likely to lead to
excessive fibroproliferation and obliteration of small airways
in OB.25 The role played by pro-inflammatory cytokines in
driving excessive fibroproliferation is unclear, and our data may
highlight a possible novel mechanism in the lung.
Alveolar macrophages play a crucial role in initiating an acute
inflammatory response in the lung and, on activation, produce a

performed in five individual cell donors.

multitude of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors.26
A prominent product produced by macrophages is TNFa which
is believed to play a role in fibrotic disorders.27 Also, an increase
in the level of intracellular TNFa found in CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells during acute lung transplant rejection has been reported,28
and TNFa can increase metastatic potential in human colonic
epithelial organoid models of colon cancer by accentuating
EMT.29 The addition of TNFa to cultures containing TGF-b1
significantly increased the expression of vimentin and fibronec￾tin while further downregulating E-cadherin and cytokeratin-19
expression compared with TGF-b1 alone. Our observations,
together with those of previous studies, suggest a possible link
between acute inflammation and accentuated TGF-b1-driven
epithelial remodelling.
The demonstration of EMT in cultured cells always causes
debate as to whether the observations represent true EMT or
simply a ‘‘stress response’’ of cells in culture. It is our opinion
that demonstrating true transition from an epithelial to a
mesenchymal phenotype requires analysis of functional proper￾ties as well as protein expression and morphology. The secretion
of MMP is one functional characteristic of mesenchymal cells.
The ability of our ex vivo cultures to acquire an invasive
phenotype was analysed. TGF-b1 induces a threefold increase in
the number of invasive cells which is associated with an
increased secretion of pro-MMP-9. As with protein expression,
co-treatment of the cells with TGF-b1 and TNFa further
accentuated the effects with an increase in both pro-MMP-9
production and the number of invasive cells observed. These
observations support our hypothesis that epithelial cells in the
airway may undergo EMT, penetrate the basement membrane
and migrate into the subepithelial layer to lay down excessive
connective tissue.
The cells that drive the obstruction of the bronchioles in OB
are capable of depositing ECM proteins such as fibronectin and
collagen I. We confirmed that TGF-b1 induced a marked
increase in collagen I secretion. However, in the presence of
TNFa this was inhibited. This result is in agreement with
previous studies showing that TNFa can inhibit collagen
production both in vivo and in vitro.30–32 Interestingly, although
TGF-b1 induced an increase in fibronectin deposition, the
addition of TNFa had no significant effect on this which
suggests that different pathways may control collagen I and
fibronectin deposition. This raises the intriguing possibility that
episodic release of TNFa in the presence of TGF-b1—such as
could occur in response to repeated inflammatory insults to the
lung—could drive migration and invasion of transformed
epithelial cells but not deposition of collagen until the levels
of TNFa fall again, in which case the transformed cells could
then drive fibrosis.
The changes seen in expression levels of E-cadherin, vimentin
and a-SMA in the epithelium of OB lung compared with stable
transplant recipients as well as our finding of co-localisation of
epithelial and mesenchymal markers in individual cells in the
epithelium of OB lung support our hypothesis. In this study,
areas of intact epithelium were analysed in OB, stable and
control lung. We did not analyse severely remodelled airways in
the OB lung as these areas represent advanced lesions where the
identification of the epithelium is impossible. Instead, our
approach allowed a direct comparison between marker expres￾sion in the study groups.
Our data do not prove a definitive causative link between the
remodelling seen in BOS and EMT in the airway. However, we
believe these observations represent a significant increase in the
understanding of the potential for airway epithelium to undergo
EMT and, in addition, highlight a possible synergistic action
between acute inflammation and the ability of TGF-b1 to drive
EMT. The mechanism driving this synergy needs more
investigation to identify possible therapeutic targets that may
interfere with this process in the lung.

ANSWER
From the question on page 756
The history of the farmer’s eating habits and diet had to be
taken into consideration and questioned. It was found that he
had a history of eating raw meat, with frequent consumption of
uncooked dog and cow liver. The level of eosinophil cationic
protein was 12.50 mg/l and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
contained 20.8% monocytes, 4.6% neutrophils, 69.4% lympho￾cytes and 5.2% eosinophils. An open lung biopsy revealed
extensive eosinophilic infiltration and a larval nematode near
the pleural surface (fig 1). An ELISA with the larval excretory–
secretory antigen of Toxocara canis was positive. He was treated
with albendazole at 13 mg/kg/day (800 mg/day) for 6 weeks.
After 6 months, he had improved chest radiographs and no
respiratory symptoms.
Human infection by the nematode T canis occurs by ingesting
embryonated eggs from the environment or encapsulated larvae
from uncooked animal liver.1 In 1952, Beaver et al identified
larvae of T canis in a liver biopsy specimen and proposed the
term visceral larva migrans (VLM).2 The larvae penetrate the
intestinal wall and begin a migration through the tissues. VLM
involves several organ systems, such as the liver, lung, skin and,
rarely, the central nervous system.3 Since T canis larvae are
rarely detected by pathological examination, the most reliable
diagnostic method is ELISA with excretory–secretory antigens.4
We believe that this is the first reported case of toxocariasis by
direct detection of a Toxocara larva in an adult lung biopsy
specimen. Toxocariasis should be considered as a differential
diagnosis for adult patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome
and a history of eating raw foods.
