Abstract
T cells have been classified as belonging to the Th1 or Th2 subsets according to the production of defining cytokines such
as IFN-c and IL-4. The discovery of the Th17 lineage and regulatory T cells shifted the simple concept of the Th1/Th2 balance
into a 4-way mechanistic pathway of local and systemic immunological activity. Clinically, the blockage of cytokine signals
or non-specific suppression of cytokine predominance by immunosuppressants is the first-line treatment for inflammatory T
cell-mediated disorders. Cyclosporine A (CsA) and Tacrolimus (Tac) are commonly used immunosuppressants for the
treatment of autoimmune disease, psoriasis, and atopic disorders. Many studies have shown that these compounds
suppress the activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, thereby inhibiting T-cell activation. Although
CsA and Tac are frequently utilized, their pharmacological mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present
study, we focused on the effects of CsA and Tac on cytokine secretion from purified human memory CD4+
T cells and the
differentiation of naı¨ve T cells into cytokine-producing memory T cells. CsA or Tac significantly inhibited IFN-c, IL-4, and IL￾17 production from memory T cells. These compounds also inhibited T cell differentiation into the Th1, Th2, and Th17
subsets, even when used at a low concentration. This study provided critical information regarding the clinical efficacies of
CsA and Tac as immunosuppressants.

Introduction
Previously, T cells were classified as Th1 or Th2 subtypes
according to the production of defining cytokines such as IFN-c, IL￾12, and IL-4. Several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and psoriasis, had been considered to be Th1-cell￾mediated disorders driven by a population of T cells producing
inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-12, TNF-a and interferons
[1,2,3]. On the other hand, atopic dermatitis (AD) is a Th2-type
cytokine-mediated chronic disease associated with increased Th2
cellular infiltration and overproduction of IgE [4]. However, Th1
cells are also involved in AD in both the acute and chronic phases.
The discovery of the Th17 lineage and regulatory T cells shifted the
simple concept of the Th1/Th2 balance into 4-way system. Th17/22
cells, Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg), and IL-10-producing T cells
(Tr1) are deeply involved in the mechanisms of the local and systemic
immunological milieu [5]. Recently, RA and psoriasis have been
characterized as Th17- and Th1-mediated diseases but are mainly
Th17-induced disorders. Super Th1 cells are also involved in the
development of Th2 disorders [6]. Clinically, the blockage of cytokine
signals or non-specific suppression of cytokine predominance by
immunosuppressants for T cell-mediated inflammatory disorders is
the first line treatment. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is a frequently used
immunosuppressant for the treatment of Th1, Th2, and Th17/22
disorders. Many studies have shown that CsA binds to cyclophilin
intracellularly to prohibit the synergistic action of Ca2+ and
suppresses the activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase
calcineurin, thereby affecting the production of cytokines, such as IL￾2 and IFN-c [7,8]. Tacrolimus (Tac) is also a widely used T-cell￾targeted immunosuppressant and a known calcineurin inhibitor. This
macrolide from the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces tsukubaensis
exerts its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting T-cell activation,
particularly in Th1 cells. Several reports have shown that Tac
treatment improves psoriasis, which is driven by a mixed population
of Th17/Th22 and Th1 cells [9,10]. However, the pharmacological
mechanisms of CsA and Tac have not yet been fully elucidated.
In the present study, we investigated the effects of CsA and Tac
on cytokine production from memory CD4+ T cells. We also
examined whether these compounds influence the differentiation
of naı¨ve T cells into Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells.

Switzerland), and Tacrolimus (Tac) was purchased from Astellas
Pharma Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and ionomycin were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Purified anti-human
CD3 mAb, anti-hCD28 mAb, anti-hIFN-c-PerCP mAb, anti￾hIL-4-PerCP mAb, anti-hIL-17-PerCP mAb, and brefeldin A

(Minneapolis, MN, USA). Recombinant hIL-1b, rhTGF-b, rhIL￾6, and rhIL-2 were purchased from PeproTech (Princeton, NJ,
USA). Complete RPMI 1640 medium was made with 10% heat￾inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories,
INC., South Logan, UT, USA), 2.0 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto,
JAPAN).
Purification of CD4+ T cells
PBMCs were isolated from fresh heparinized venous blood
using Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma-Aldlich, St. Louis, MO) density
gradient centrifugation. Cells were washed twice in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), and purified CD4+ T cells were obtained
by negative selection using the CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit II
(Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, for CD4+ T-cell selection,
PBMCs were incubated for 10 min with 20 ml of the antibody
cocktail mixture followed by a 15 min incubation with 20 ml of
magnetic beads per 107 cells. Unconjugated CD4+ T cells were
then isolated from PBMCs by indirect magnetic labeling over
MiniMACS separation LS columns. Sorted populations were
analyzed by flow cytometry, and the purity of samples ranged
between 96 and 99%.
Separation of naı¨ve and memory CD4+ T cells
Naı¨ve CD4+ T cells were obtained by positive selection, and
memory CD4+ T cells were obtained by negative selection from
the purified CD4+ T cells using the naı¨ve CD4+ T Cell Isolation
Kit. Untouched memory CD4+ T cells passed through the
column, whereas magnetically labeled naı¨ve CD4+ T cells
remained in the column and were washed out with buffer. The
purity of both cell populations ranged between 94 and 99%.
Cell culture of memory CD4+ T cells
Memory CD4+ T cells, suspended in complete RPMI 1640
culture medium, were plated into a flat-bottomed 24-well plate at
16106 cells/well and incubated with PMA (1 mg/mL), ionomycin
(1 mg/mL) and brefeldin A (1 mg/mL) in the absence or presence
of CsA (100 or 1000 ng/mL) or Tac (16.7 or 167 ng/mL) and
cultured for 24 h at 37uC with 5% CO2.
Generation of Th1 cells in vitro
Th1 cells were generated by culturing naı¨ve CD4+ T cells
(16106
/mL) with PHA (1 mg/mL), rhIL-12 (50 ng/mL), and anti￾hIL-4 mAb (500 ng/mL) in a flat-bottomed 24-well plate in 1 mL
of complete RPMI1640 culture medium at 37uC with 5% CO2 in
the absence or presence of CsA (100 or 1000 ng/mL) or Tac (16.7
or 167 ng/mL). These stimulated T cells were collected and
washed on day 3 and expanded in the same culture medium with
the addition of100 U/mL of rhIL-2 for an additional 3 days. On
day 6, cells were stimulated with PMA (1 mg/mL) and ionomycin
(1 mg/mL) in the presence of brefeldin A (1 mg/mL) for 8 h.
Generation of Th2 cells in vitro
Th2 cells were generated by culturing naı¨ve CD4+ T cells
(16106
/mL) with PHA (1 mg/mL), rhIL-4 (200 ng/mL), and anti￾hIL-12 mAb (10 mg/mL) in a flat-bottomed 24-well plate in the
complete RPMI1640 culture medium at 37uC with 5% CO2.
Cultures were supplemented with CsA (100 or 1000 ng/mL) or Tac
(16.7 or 167 ng/mL). These stimulated T cells were washed on day
3 and expanded in the same culture medium with the addition of
100 U/mL of rhIL-2 for an additional 3 days. On day 6, cells were
stimulated with PMA (1 mg/mL), ionomycin (1 mg/mL) and
brefeldin A (1 mg/mL). The cells were incubated for additional 8 h.
Generation of Th17 cells in vitro
Th17 cells were generated by culturing naı¨ve CD4+ T cells
(16106
/mL) with rhIL-2 (10 U/mL), rhTGF-b (5 ng/mL), rhIL-6
(20 ng/mL), rhIL-1b (10 ng/mL), rhIL-23 (10 ng/mL), anti-hIL￾4 mAb (1 mg/mL), anti-hIFN-c mAb (1 mg/mL), anti-hCD3 mAb
(4 mg/mL), and anti-hCD28 mAb (8 mg/mL) in a flat-bottomed
24-well plate in complete RPMI1640 culture medium. Cells were
cultured in the absence or presence of CsA (100 or 1000 ng/mL)
or Tac (16.7 or 167 ng/mL) at 37uC with 5% CO2. On days 3 and
5, the culture plate was centrifuged, and the media was removed
and replaced with fresh media containing all cytokines mentioned
above, antibodies, and CsA or Tac. On day 6, cells were
stimulated with PMA (1 mg/mL), ionomycin (1 mg/mL) and
brefeldin A (1 mg/mL). The cells were incubated for 8 h at 37uC
in 5% CO2.
Cell surface and intracellular staining of CD4+ T cells
Cultured CD4+ T cells were collected and washed twice with
PBS containing 1% FBS. Cell surface antigens and intracellular
cytokines were stained according to the formal Cell Surface
Immunofluorescence Staining Protocol and Intracellular Cytokine
Staining Protocol (BioLegend). Briefly, for analyzing cytokine
production from memory cells, the cells were first stained with
anti-hCD4-FITC mAb. To detect cellular differentiation of naı¨ve
T cells into cytokine-producing cells, the cells are first stained with
anti-hCD45RA-FITC and anti-hCD45RO-PE mAbs. After treat￾ment with the fixation and permeabilization wash buffer, the cells
are incubated with PerCP-conjugated anti-hIFN-c, anti-hIL-4, or
IL-17A mAbs. Fluorescence profiles are analyzed by flow
cytometry using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA),
and the data were analyzed using Cell Quest Pro software (BD
Biosciences).
Statistical analyses
The statistical differences between variables were calculated
using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. P,0.05
was considered to be significant.

ionomycin in the absence or presence of CsA or Tac. Resulting
fluorescence profiles showed distinct cytokine production from
mature cells, and production of all cytokines investigated here
was strikingly suppressed with the addition of CsA or Tac, even at
the lower concentration (Fig. 1A). The percentages of IFN￾c+

IL-17+ cells were also decreased
compared with control group (Fig. 2C, D).
Discussion
CsA and Tac are commonly used to treat immunological
diseases; however, the relevant pharmacological mechanisms have
yet to be fully understood. In the present study, we focused on the
effects of CsA and Tac on the differentiation of naı¨ve CD4+ T cells
into cytokine-producing memory T cells as well as on the actual
cytokine secretion from memory CD4+ T cells using T cells from
human PBMCs. We used two concentrations of CsA; the low
concentration was 100 ng/mL, and the high concentration was
1000 ng/mL; these concentrations are similar to the serum CsA
levels at trough and 2-hours peak concentrations of clinically
treated patients, respectively. On the other hand, the concentra￾tion of Tac was16.7 and 167 ng/mL, and both of these values

independent experiments are shown (A). Addition of CsA or Tac lowered the percentage of CD45RA2CD45RO+

also decreased compared with the control group (C,D). Data are expressed as the mean 6 SEM.

were derived from safety trough and peak levels for clinical
application. We observed successful suppression of cytokine
secretion from memory T cells by CsA and Tac. Interestingly, T
cell differentiation into the memory cell subset is also prohibited by
CsA and Tac even at the lower concentrations.
Previously most autoimmune diseases had been considered to
be Th1-cell-mediated; however, recent evidence has indicated that
IL-17-producing Th17 cells represent the key effector cells in the
induction and development of these disorders [11,12]. IL-17 has
pleiotropic activities, such as coordinating tissue inflammation by
inducing the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines,
chemokines and matrix metalloproteases [12,13]. Similar to AD,
autoimmune disorders are a complex mixture of Th1 and Th17/
22 lineage cells. We analyzed two calcineurin inhibitors that
suppressed the production of all examined cytokines.
T cells receive activation signals through T-cell receptors,
inducing intracellular Ca++ release and activating calcineurin,
which dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells
(NFATc). Dephosphorylated NFATc moves into the nucleus and
functions as a transcription factor [14]. CsA binding with
cyclophilin and Tac coupling with FK-binding protein inhibit
calcineurin in T cells. These complexes bind calcineurin, prevent
its activation, and block dephosphorylation of NFATc. This lack of
dephosphorylation prevents NFATc from activating the transcrip￾tion of the IL-2 gene. Thus, CsA and Tac reduce activation of IL￾2, which is an activator and important growth factor for T cells
[15]; therefore, T cell activity is suppressed. CsA and Tac have
been clinically used to control Th2-dominant ADs well as Th17/
22-dominant psoriasis and related diseases with successful results.
Suppression of functional cytokine secretion from differentiated
memory T cells by calcineurin inhibitors has been explained
through IL-2 gene inhibition. However, the results presented here
revealed effects on individual cytokine production from the
already differentiated pathogenic T cells in various diseases.
The initial dose of the calcineurin inhibitors for immunological
diseases is higher than that of the maintenance dose. The present
results confirmed significant effects of calcineurin inhibitors on T
cell differentiation at clinically relevant concentrations. Thus, the
actions of the calcineurin inhibitors are not limited to non-specific
inhibition of T cell-mediated inflammation. These drugs may play
fundamental roles in correcting immunological imbalances in
allergic and inflammatory diseases. These data also explain the
significant and rapid effects of calcineurin inhibitors in atopic
dermatitis and related diseases with limited dose and durations.
In conclusion, CsA and Tac inhibit calcineurin in T cells, block
the dephosphorylation and translocation of NFATc, inhibit
cytokine production from memory CD4+ T cells, and prevent
the differentiation of naı¨ve CD4+ T cells into cytokine-producing
memory CD4+ T cells. CsA and Tac are promising immunosup￾pressants for Th1, Th2, and Th17/22 associated disorders.
