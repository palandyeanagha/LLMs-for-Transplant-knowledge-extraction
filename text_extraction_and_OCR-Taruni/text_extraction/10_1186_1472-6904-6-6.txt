Abstract
Background: Voriconazole was introduced for the treatment of life-threatening fungal infections.
The intravenous form includes the solvent vehicle sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium
which shows an impaired clearance under intermittent dialysis therapy. This investigation aimed to
determine first clinical data on sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium blood levels to verify the
risk for accumulation.
Methods: In four patients suffering from renal insufficiency and intermittent dialysis therapy who
needed a treatment with intravenous voriconazole as a reserve antifungal at the intensive care unit
of the Mainz University Hospital the trough levels of voriconazole and sulphobutylether beta
cyclodextrin sodium were measured.
Results: A 75-year-old woman showed a maximal sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium
plasma level of 145 µg/ml in the initial phase. After a few days renal function recovered and the
plasma levels came down to less than 20 µg/ml. In contrast to this patient with a recovery of renal
function the remaining three patients showed renal failure during the complete period of
intravenous treatment with voriconazole. In these patients an accumulation of sulphobutylether
beta cyclodextrin sodium plasma levels was determined with a maximum of 523 µg/ml in a 18-year￾old man, 409 µg/ml in a 57-year-old man, and 581 µg/ml in a 47-year-old man.
Conclusion: The present data indicate an accumulation of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin
sodium in patients treated with intravenous voriconazole and dialysis therapy. Fortunately, no toxic
effects were observed, although the accumulated dose values were lower but comparable with
those used in previous toxicity studies with animals.
Background
The triazole antifungal, voriconazole, was introduced for
the treatment of life-threatening fungal infections. The
drug, which is available for both oral and intravenous
administration, has broad-spectrum activity against path￾ogenic yeasts, dimorphic fungi and opportunistic moulds

[1,2]. As voriconazole has limited aqueous solubility, the
intravenous form includes the solvent vehicle sul￾phobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium as a novel deliv￾ery system [3]. In healthy subjects sulphobutylether beta
cyclodextrin sodium is rapidly eliminated with a terminal
half-life of 1.6 hours. The clearance of sulphobutylether
beta cyclodextrin sodium is linearly related to creatinine
clearance and accumulation has been described in sub￾jects with moderate to severe renal impairment (serum
creatinine levels > 2.5 mg/dl) [4]. In patients with an esti￾mated creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 ml/min the mean
Cmax and AUC of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin
sodium increased by almost 50% and 4-fold, respectively,
compared to subjects with normal renal function [5].
Additionally, sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium
is known to show an impaired clearance under dialysis
therapy of 55 ml/min determined in volunteers with renal
failure undergoing hemodialysis [6]. Clinical data regard￾ing this problem have not been available so far. The man￾ufacturer suggests to balance the possible risk of
accumulation of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin
sodium and the benefit of the antifungal effect [7]. Fur￾thermore, it is recommended to treat patients on dialysis
therapy only with the oral form of voriconazole if feasible.
However, in critically ill patients with complicated life￾threatening fungal infections a save oral administration of
drugs is difficult to accomplish as, for instance, extensive
gastric reflux, gastrointestinal bleedings or mucositis are
frequent comorbidities. In animal experiments the acute
toxicity of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium has
been observed to be low. The minimal lethal dose was
2000 mg/kg. Target organs for toxic effects in rodents were
kidney and liver with obstruction of renal tubules and sin￾gle cell necrosis in the liver. Both findings were a conse￾quence of massive cytoplasmic vacuolation [4]. In two
healthy volunteers peak sulphobutylether beta cyclodex￾trin sodium levels of 118 and 130 µg/ml, respectively,
were measured immediately following administration of
1600 mg sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium as a
single 15 minutes intravenous infusion [8]. The present
investigation aimed to determine first clinical data on sul￾phobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium blood levels to
verify the risk for accumulation.
Methods
Subjects
From March 2003 to January 2006 a total number of 29
critically ill patients (17 male, 12 female) needed a treat￾ment with intravenous voriconazole as a reserve antifun￾gal at the 10-bed general intensive care unit of the Mainz
University Hospital. 15 patients (51.7 %) required inter￾mittent dialysis due to acute (14 patients) or chronic (1
patient) renal failure. In four patients suffering from renal
insufficiency the trough plasma levels of voriconazole and
sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium were meas￾ured. Blood samples were collected in Monovette plastic
tubes and immediately centrifuged at 2000g at 4°C. This
investigation was approved by the Institutional Review
Board (Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany). The board waived the
need for informed consent. Additionally, monitoring for
possible toxic effects of sulphobutylether beta cyclodex￾trin sodium regarding level of consciousness, hemody￾namic stability, dermal reactions, and liver function tests
was performed.
Voriconazole and sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin 
sodium measurements
Voriconazole was determined according to a previously
published method [9]. In brief, plasma samples were
spiked with internal standard and borate buffer was
added. The samples were loaded onto solid phase extrac￾tion (SPE) columns, washed with buffer and methanol/
water, and eluted with methanol/acetic acid mixture. After
drying, the extracts were reconstituted with mobile HPLC
phase and analyzed by HPLC/UV. The limit of quantifica￾tion was 0.2 µg/ml. The precision of determination (coef￾ficient of variation) was 7.2, 7.9, 3.2, and 3.7% at quality
control concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 3.4, and 6.9 µg/ml,
respectively. Sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium
was determined according to a previously published
method [8]: Phosphate buffer was added to plasma sam￾ples before loading onto SPE columns (Chromabond,
cyclohexyl). The loaded SPE columns were washed with
buffer and eluted with methanol/water (30/70) mixture.
After drying, the extracts were reconstituted in methanol/
water (10/90) and analyzed by HPLC/Fluorescence. The
limit of quantification was 4.00 µg/ml. The precision of
determination (coefficient of variation) was 5.7, 6.7, 7.0,
and 6.9% at quality control concentrations of 4.00, 14.9,
65.2, and 126 µg/ml, respectively. The analytical methods
were validated according to FDA validation guidelines
and fulfilled the respective quality assurance for accuracy
and precision.
Results
The analysis of the four patients suffering from renal
insufficiency for whom plasma levels of voriconazole and
sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium were meas￾ured revealed two different courses of renal impairment
which required a clear differentiation:
Patients with restoration of renal function
A 75-year-old woman submitted with acute myeloid
leukemia showed a maximal sulphobutylether beta cyclo￾dextrin sodium plasma level of 145 µg/ml in the initial
phase of treatment with intravenous voriconazole (Figure
1, Table 1, patient no. 1). After a few days renal function
recovered and the plasma levels came down to less than
20 µg/ml after 10 days of treatment with intravenous vor￾iconazole.

Patients without restoration of renal function
In contrast to the patient with a recovery of renal function
the remaining three patients showed renal failure during
the complete period of intravenous treatment with vorico￾nazole. In these patients an accumulation of sul￾phobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium plasma levels
was determined with a maximum of 523 µg/ml in a 18-
year-old man submitted with myocarditis (Table 1,
patient no. 2), 409 µg/ml in a 57-year-old man submitted
with multiple myeloma (Table 1, patient no. 3), and 581
µg/ml in a 47-year-old man submitted with intestinal
ischemia (Table 1, patient no. 4).
Voriconazole plasma levels
Besides sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium vori￾conazole plasma levels were determined which were most
commonly less than 1.5 µg/ml and showed no evidence
for accumulation (Table 1). In patient no. 1 the levels
were, in part, not detectable. In patient no. 3 all voricona￾zole measurements were distinctly elevated as compared
to the remaining patients which was due to a concomit￾tant hepatic insufficiency.
Technical aspects of dialysis, clinical and biochemical 
monitoring
Hemodialysis in the four patients was performed using a
low flux AM-BIO 750 cartridge (ASAHI KASEI MEDICAL
EUROPE GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). The average fre￾quency of the dialysis sessions was every 24 to 48 hours,
the duration was 4 hours, blood flow 200 to 220 ml/min,
and fluid extraction 2 to 3 liters to maintain proper fluid
balance. Clinical and biochemical data to assess the toxic￾ity of accumulation of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin
sodium were determined but in these critically ill patients
with complicated disease it was difficult to trace back pos￾sible effects. Patient no. 3 was sedated, intubated and
mechanically ventilated during the whole course of intra￾venous voriconazole treatment. Patients no. 2 and 4 were
awake but tracheotomized and not fully orientated.
Patient no. 1 was extubated but she was somnolent and
could not answer questions. None of the patients showed
an obvious deterioration of the level of consciousness
during the treatment with voriconazole. A more detailed

zole could not be performed in these patients. Dermal
reactions were not observed under intravenous voricona￾zole treatment. Patients no. 1, 2, and 4 were hemodynam￾ically stable without catecholamines. Patient no. 3 needed
treatment with noradrenaline which required adjustment
to individual situations like during high fever or during
dialysis. Liver function test results at the beginning of
intravenous voriconazole treatment compared to the end
of treatment showed the hepatic impairment of patient
no. 3 (Table 2).
Discussion
Patients with the need for an intravenous treatment with
voriconazole were rare with about 10 patients per year at
the 10-bed general intensive care unit. However, when
such a treatment was required more than half of the
patients were under renal replacement therapy.
Sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium findings
The present data indicate an accumulation of sul￾phobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium in patients with
renal failure and intermittent dialysis therapy given intra￾venous voriconazole in whom restoration of renal func￾tion was not achieved during the treatment course. In
contrast, in the patient in whom restoration of renal func￾tion was obtained early during the treatment with intrave￾nous voriconazole, accumulation of sulphobutylether
beta cyclodextrin sodium was not observed. Fortunately,
there was no evidence for toxic effects related to the con￾centrations of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium
measured in these patients. Assuming no abnormalities in
the volume distribution (the steady-state volume of distri￾bution of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium is
approximately 0.2 L/kg, which is similar to extracellular
fluid volume in humans) the maximal concentration val￾ues of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium would
be translate back to a total amount of about 100 mg/kg
accumulated sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium
on board. This extrapolated dose value was about 10-fold
lower than the usual doses used in animal models for tox￾icity assessment. In animal experiments the minimal sin￾gle lethal dose has been determined to be 2000 mg/kg,
while daily doses of 1000 mg/kg for one month or 600
mg/kg for six months did not produce functional renal
changes [4]. Assuming a half-life of sulphobutylether beta
cyclodextrin sodium in healthy animals of 1.6 hours the
single doses of 1000 or 600 mg/kg would have been elim￾inated within a few hours (animals receiving 1000 mg/kg
would have less than 100 mg/kg on board within about
3.5 hours). In contrast, the 100 mg/kg in our patients with
renal failure would represent a continuous baseline level.
Therefore, the range of the presently determined sul￾phobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium concentrations
might well be considered to be toxic from clinical perspec￾tive. Nevertheless, for comparisons with animal data a
word of caution is suitable regarding the presently investi￾gated patients with renal insufficiency. The sick kidney
may be protected from the toxic action of sul￾phobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium, which is neph￾rotoxic through its reuptake from glomerular filtrate by
the kidney tubules. This phenomenon has been shown for
aminoglykoside antibiotics, which share this mechanism
of toxicity. However, accumulation of drug delivery vehi￾cles bare many potential risks to these critically ill patients
and should be prevented [10,11]. Alternative antifungals
like liposomal amphotericin B or caspofungin should be
considered or intravenous voriconazole therapy should
be switched to oral administration as soon as possible.
The possible accumulation of sulphobutylether beta
cyclodextrin sodium in patients under renal replacement
therapy should be studied in prospective clinical studies
in more detail. Furthermore, different renal replacement
techniques like dialysis with high-flux membranes or con￾tinuous veno-venous hemofiltration need to be evaluated
regarding the clearance of sulphobutylether beta cyclo￾dextrin sodium.
Voriconazole findings
Regarding the voriconazole plasma levels published data
in patients with renal insufficiency is rare. A case report in
a patient with chronic renal insufficiency treated by con￾tinuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration, which focussed
solely on voriconazole levels, demonstrated that no dos￾age adjustment was required [12]. The voriconazole
plasma levels presently found in patients no. 1, 2, and 4
were in line with published data on healthy subjects

which received 3 mg kg-1 twice daily. By day 12 this pre￾vious study showed a maximal concentration of voricona￾zole of 2.4 µg/ml and a half-life of 6.4 hours [13]. The
trough levels of voriconazole presently determined were
at several points lower than the minimum inhibitory con￾centrations for aspergillus spp., candida spp., and for
most emerging fungal pathogens (minimal concentration
> 0.8 µg/ml). Nevertheless, voriconazole treatment levels
< 0.2 µg/ml have frequently been observed in successfully
treated patients and the manufacturer does not suggest a
dosage adjustment [7]. The higher levels of voriconazole
in patient no. 3 were in line with our previous observa￾tions that patients with liver insufficiency frequently show
levels around 5 µg/ml (our valid range for voriconazole
plasma levels is from 0.2 to 10 µg/ml). Previous studies
showed that liver function test abnormalities were statisti￾cally significant but weakly associated with elevated
plasma voriconazole concentrations. To investigate
potential threshold effects, patients with plasma voricona￾zole concentrations above and below various threshold
values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 µg/ml) were analyzed. These inves￾tigations did not identify threshold plasma concentra￾tions above which the risk of a liver function test
abnormality was higher compared with plasma concen￾trations below the threshold [4].
Conclusion
The present data indicated an accumulation of sul￾phobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium in patients
treated with intravenous voriconazole and dialysis ther￾apy. Obvious adverse effects related to the accumulation
of the drug delivery vehicle could not be observed,
although the presently extrapolated dose values were
lower but comparable with those used in animal experi￾ments for toxicity studies. Intravenous application of vor￾iconazole in patients on dialysis therapy should be
evaluated carefully. Systematic clinical investigations are
required to prevent potential harm to these critically ill
patients due to an accumulation of sulphobutylether beta
cyclodextrin sodium.
