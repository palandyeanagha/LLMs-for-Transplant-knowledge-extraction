Abstract
Purpose: Knowledge of natural tumour growth is valuable for understanding
tumour biology, optimising screening programs, prognostication, optimal scheduling
of chemotherapy, and assessing tumour spread. However, mathematical modelling
in individuals is hampered by the limited data available. We aimed to develop a
method to estimate parameters of the growth model and formation rate of
metastases in individual patients.
Materials and methods: Data from one patient with liver metastases from a primary
ileum carcinoid and one patient with lung metastases from a primary renal cell
carcinoma were used to demonstrate this new method. Metastatic growth models
were estimated by direct curve fitting, as well as with the new proposed method
based on the relationship between tumour growth rate and tumour volume. The
new model was derived from the Gompertzian growth model by eliminating the
time factor (age of metastases), which made it possible to perform the calculations
using data from all metastases in each patient. Finally, the formation time of each
metastasis and, consecutively, the formation rate of metastases in each patient were
estimated.
Results: With limited measurements in clinical studies, fitting different growth curves
was insufficient to estimate true tumour growth, even if patients were followed for
several years. Growth of liver metastases was well described with a general growth
model for all metastases. However, the lung metastases from renal cell carcinoma
were better described by heterogeneous exponential growth with various growth
rates.
Conclusion: Analysis of the regression of tumour growth rate with the logarithm of
tumour volume can be used to estimate parameters of the tumour growth model
and metastasis formation rates, and therefore the number and size distribution of
metastases in individuals.

Introduction
Studying natural tumour growth is valuable for understanding tumour biology, op￾timising screening programs, prognostication [1], optimal scheduling of chemotherapy
[2], and assessing tumour spread (number and size distribution of metastases, inclu￾ding micro-metastases) [3,4]. Mathematical models such as the exponential and the
Gompertzian growth models are usually used to describe tumour growth. The growth

of a tumour can be described by a curve defined by the selected model, where the
tumour volume (V) is a function of time (t): V = f(t).
The exponential model is a simple growth model of solid tumours. Assuming expo￾nential tumour growth, the growth rate can be calculated from tumour volume mea￾surements from at least two occasions, either as the tumour volume doubling time
(DT) or the specific growth rate (SGR) [5]. DT is the time needed for a tumour to
double its volume, and SGR is the relative volume increase per unit time, given in
%/day. If the tumour volume is measured at times t0 and t, the following equation is
valid [5]:
V ¼ V0eSGR tð Þ −t0 ð1Þ
The above equation shows that SGR is equivalent to the exponential growth constant
of the tumour. In other words:
SGR ¼ 1
V
dV
dt ð2Þ
If tumour volume is measured on two occasions, t1 and t2, then the SGR of the
tumour during the period of observation can be calculated as:
SGR ¼ ln Vð Þ 2=V1
t2−t1
ð3Þ
where V1 and V2 are the tumour volume at t = t1 and t2, respectively. SGR is recipro￾cally related to DT as follows:
SGR ¼ ln 2ð Þ
DT : ð4Þ
We have previously demonstrated that SGR is less affected by measurement uncer￾tainties than DT, and is a better variable to characterise tumour growth rate [5,6].
According to the exponential model, the tumour’s SGR is constant and independent
of tumour volume. However, studies have shown that tumour growth rate may decline
with time [7-9] (i.e., non-exponential growth).
The Gompertzian model is widely used to describe the growth of non-exponentially
growing tumours. According to the Gompertzian growth model, the variation of
tumour volume with respect to time is as follows:
V ¼ V0e
SGR0
λ 1−e−λ t−t ð Þ0
 
ð5Þ
where SGR0 is the initial tumour growth rate at t = t0, and λ is the growth deceleration
constant. When λ approaches zero, the Equation 5 reduces to Equation 1 (i.e., the ex￾ponential growth model).
The standard method to find the growth model that best describes tumour growth is
direct curve fitting. Exponential and Gompertzian growth curves are fitted to the vol￾ume of each tumour, and the model with the best fit is selected. Using direct curve fit￾ting with the Gompertzian model requires at least three data points per tumour.
However, in clinical studies, therapy is usually initiated soon after diagnosis; therefore,
the natural tumour growth patterns can only be followed for a limited time before the
onset of treatment. Thus, clinical observations of growth rate decline in tumours (i.e.,

non-exponential growth curves) are very rare, and the exponential model is most com￾monly used [10].
The aim of this study was to develop a new method to estimate the parameters of the
non-exponential growth model for metastatic tumours in patients. To demonstrate the
applicability of the new proposed method, we applied the method to data from one pa￾tient with liver metastases arising from a primary ileum carcinoid and one patient with
lung metastases arising from a primary renal cell carcinoma.
Materials and methods
Patients
Data from two patients were used in this study. The first patient was diagnosed with pri￾mary midgut carcinoid and liver metastases. The primary tumour was surgically resected
in 1995. Growth data were obtained from eight computed tomography (CT) examinations
performed annually during 1995–2002. During this period, the patient was treated with
octreotide (Sandostatin, Sandoz/Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) for hormonal symptom re￾lief, and interferon alfa-2b (IntronA, Schering-Plough Corporation, New Jersey, USA) was
administered on three occasions without clinical response. The volume of each tumour
was measured by point counting: a transparent paper marked with square millimeters was
used to measure the tumour area in CT slices, and the tumour volume in the slice was es￾timated by multiplying the tumour area by the slice thickness. The total tumour volume
was calculated as the sum of tumour volumes from the individual CT slices.
The second patient was diagnosed with primary renal cell carcinoma with lung me￾tastases. Renal cancer is notoriously chemotherapy resistant. During the 1980th bio￾logical therapy with interferon with few responses, but considerable toxicity, was
introduced and in the 1990th also IL2 was added, again with modest efficacy but with
significant side effects [11]. Due to the frequently very slow disease progression with
few symptoms (as in this case), many oncologists in the Scandinavian countries pre￾ferred expectation. The frequent X-ray investigations were probably done for psycho￾logical reasons. Therefore, this patient was untreated and we studied the natural
growth of seven lung metastases in this patient. A total of 32 conventional two￾dimensional AP chest radiographs collected from 1989 to 1999 were available. The
area of each tumour in each radiograph was estimated using Osirix (cf. http://www.
osirix-viewer.com/). Each tumour was assumed to be equal to the volume of a sphere
with the diameter of a circle with the same area as the estimated tumour area in the
radiograph. Because the lining border of the tumour could not be clearly defined in
all images, the number of available data points may vary for different metastatic
tumour masses.
All CT and X-ray imaging data used in this study concern deceased persons and were
retrieved retrospectively from the patient imaging database at Sahlgrenska University
Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. This type of information on deceased persons is exempt
from ethical approval according to the Ethical Review Act in Sweden (2003:460).
Studying the tumour growth model
We first attempted to estimate the growth model of each tumour by direct curve
fitting, where it was not possible to select the most probable growth model of each

metastasis directly. However, exponential growth rates were higher for smaller tumours
than for larger tumours, possibly as a result of growth deceleration as tumours grow
(the Gompertzian growth model). Therefore, we developed a new mathematical
method assuming that, in each patient, the smaller metastases represent the growth of
larger metastases when they were of small size and vice versa. Based on this assump￾tion, all metastases of the same type, in the same tissue and in the same patient, follow
a general Gompertzian growth model; variations in growth rates are because of volu￾metric differences. If the time of formation of each metastasis were available, it would
be possible to estimate the parameters of such a general Gompertzian model by fitting
the Gompertzian curve to data from all metastases in a single curve fitting. However,
the formation time of each metastasis can, in turn, be estimated only if the growth
model of the metastasis is known. Therefore, we reformulated the Gompertzian curve
(i.e., Equation 5) by eliminating the time parameter. From Equations 2 and 5, the rela￾tion between SGR and tumour volume is as follows (see Appendix A):
SGR ¼ SGR0−λ ln VðÞ ð =V0 6Þ
Equation 6 does not include time, which makes it possible to use data from all metas￾tases of the same type in a single patient without knowing the age of each individual
tumour. Equation 6 shows that the regression of tumour SGR with the logarithm of its
volume is linear if the growth model is Gompertzian. Therefore, the parameters of the
general Gompertzian growth model of metastasis in each patient (SGR0 and λ) can be
estimated using the linear regression parameters in Equation 6.
This method was applied to our patient data as follows. (1) SGR values were calcu￾lated for each metastasis, using Equation 3 for each pair of consecutive tumour volume
measurements. (2) The logarithm of the geometric mean of the two volumes (used in
stage 1) was calculated for each pair of consecutive tumour volume measurements of
each metastasis. (3) Using all SGRs (stage 1) and volumes (stage 2) from all metastases
in each patient, λ and SGR0 were estimated using the linear regression parameters in
Equation 6, assuming V0 = 10-9 cm3 (one cell). (4) Equation 5 with the estimated λ and
SGR0 values (from stage 3) was assumed to represent the general Gompertzian growth
curve of all metastases in each patient. According to this assumption, the general
growth curve can describe the growth of each metastasis when the time origin is
changed (i.e., the curve is shifted backward and forward). Therefore, (5) the general
growth curve was fitted to the volume of each metastasis with time origin as a variable,
and the formation time of each metastasis was estimated using the best fit for each
tumour.
All curve fittings were performed using Matlab 6.5.1 with the curve fitting toolbox
(The MathWorks, USA).
Results
For both patients, it was possible to examine direct curve fitting for most tumours be￾cause the tumours had been followed for relatively long periods of time. The volume
of each tumour, in the liver (except metastases E and F) or in the lungs, was well
described by either the exponential or the Gompertzian model with high r2 values
(Table 1). Liver metastases E and F were only observed on two occasions, and the
Gompertzian model requires three data points for curve fitting. Based on the results of

the direct model fitting, it was not possible to select the most probable growth model
for each tumour. However, the estimated tumour formation times and SGR0 values dif￾fered when estimated by the different models. The estimated formation year of liver
tumour A, obtained by the exponential fit model, was 1947, which is 5 years before the
birth of the patient (1952) and, therefore, not realistic. For the best exponential fits, the
SGR values were 0.14-0.33%/day for liver metastases (Figure 1A) and 0.14-0.39%/day

for lung metastasis (Figure 1B), respectively. These values correspond to DT values of
7–17 and 6–17 months, respectively.
Figure 1C shows the best exponential and Gompertzian model curve fits for the vol￾ume of liver metastasis A. Although both models fit well with tumour volume in a
short time interval, the extrapolated tumour formation times differed by a large margin:
1947 and 1982 with the exponential and Gompertzian models, respectively. The esti￾mated SGR at time of tumour formation (SGR0) differed by an order of magnitude:
0.14%/day and 1.1%/day with the exponential and the Gompertzian models, respec￾tively. These values correspond to DT values of 17 months and 2 months, respectively.
For the liver metastases, the negative correlation between SGR and the logarithm of
tumour volume was statistically significant (r2 = 0.33, p < 0.005), and the estimated λ
and SGR0 values were 0.00023 and 0.79%/day, respectively (Figure 2A). For the lung
metastases, the correlation was not statistically significant. However, the estimated λ
and SGR0 values were 0.00007 and 0.46%/day, respectively (Figure 2B). Curve fitting of
the general Gompertzian growth model to data for the metastases in each patient are
depicted in Figure 2C,D. In each patient, the same growth curve was shifted in time to
fit the volume of each metastasis.

number of metastases increased exponentially with respect to time, assuming that the

tumours grow exponentially with different growth rates or according to a general
Gompertzian model. The increase rate of the number of metastases based on the gene￾ral Gompertzian model was higher than the rate based on the exponential model.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that, when the observation of tumour growth is limited in
time, fitting of different growth curves to the volume of each tumour is not sufficient
to estimate the true metastatic growth. In two patients, direct curve fitting was insuffi￾cient even when metastatic growths were followed for several years. Selection of the
correct tumour growth model is crucial for further analyses of metastatic formation
rate, number of metastases present, and response estimates in targeted radionuclide
therapy [8].
Because the data available in clinical studies is limited, the exponential model is often
used to characterise tumour growth. However, in the present study we demonstrated
that extrapolation of different growth curves can generate diverse tumour formation
times and metastasis formation rates (Figure 1C). This problem has also been
addressed before, and some attempts to handle limited data more efficiently have been
proposed. One method to assess tumour growth decline in clinical studies has been to
calculate the correlation between DT and tumour volume [12,13]. However, by defin￾ition this technique is not mathematically valid according to the Gompertzian growth
model. The present study was therefore based on the linear regression of tumour SGR
with the logarithm of tumour volume, a relation that was obtained by reformulating
Figure 3 The number of metastases vs. the time from formation of the first metastasis. Metastasis
formation rates were determined for liver and lung metastases according to the exponential and Gompertzian
growth models. Values in parentheses represent the constant of the exponential increase rate (per year).

the Gompertzian model. In addition, our approach enabled us to estimate metastasis
formation times and rates. Akanuma previously attempted to find the model constants
for the Gompertzian growth model using the linear correlation between growth rate
and the logarithm of tumour volume [14]. Akanuma’s method was based on a graphic
estimation of SGR at different tumour volumes. Tumours were scaled according to
their doubling time, and very high or negative values were excluded. However, we have
previously shown that negative and zero values should not be excluded from such cal￾culations [5,6].
In the proposed method, a significant negative correlation between SGR and the loga￾rithm of tumour volume indicates that growth deceleration is a dominating factor in
the observed growth rate variations. In other words, the smaller tumours represent the
growth of larger tumours when they were of small size and vice versa, and a general
Gompertzian growth model (with specific SGR0 and λ values) can describe the growth
of all tumours. Lack of correlation between SGR and the logarithm of tumour volume
indicates that biological factors other than growth deceleration dominate the observed
growth rate variations. Thus, these tumours may grow exponentially with different
growth rates or according to the Gompertzian model, but the model constants (SGR0
and λ) are heterogeneously distributed among tumours.
According to the linear regression of tumour SGR with the logarithm of tumour vol￾ume, the liver metastases in the carcinoid patient probably grow according to a general
Gompertzian growth model. This patient was treated with octreotide. Because, based
on curve fitting results, no tumours in this patient deviated from exponential growth,
the treatment was assumed to have no effect on tumour growth. The growth of lung
metastases in the patient with renal cell carcinoma exhibited high variability with our
proposed method, indicating that the renal cancer metastases in the lungs likely grew
exponentially with different growth rates. To further strengthen the accuracy of the
model selection, we extended our methodology by including analysis of the metastatic
formation rate.
The exponential model presented to describe the metastasis formation rate does not
depend on the origin of a metastasis (e.g., whether it originates from the primary or a
metastatic lesion). The model described well the increase of the number of metastases
growing exponentially with different growth rates, or growing according to a general
Gompertzian model. This finding is similar to the results of a previous study that
employed a different approach [3].
Our results showed that a decelerating growth model such as the Gompertzian model
implies a higher metastasis formation rate than the exponential model. However, a
higher metastasis formation rate does not necessarily mean a larger number of metas￾tases at any time point, and the number of metastases should be calculated for any
specific time to compare different models. The time origin in Figure 3 is time of the
formation of the first metastasis, which is different for different models. The estimated
number of liver metastases at the time of primary surgery in the ileum carcinoid patient
was 9 using the exponential model and 22 using the Gompertzian model. The value of
9 metastases did not reflect reality; 24 metastases were imaged aside from the studied
metastases. Therefore, the Gompertzian model provided the best estimate of the num￾ber of liver metastases. The estimated number of lung metastases at the time of pri￾mary surgery in the renal cell carcinoma patient was 14 according to the exponential
Mehrara et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2013, 10:31 Page 9 of 12
http://www.tbiomed.com/content/10/1/31

model and 84 according to the Gompertzian model. The value of 84 metastases is un￾likely to reflect reality, because only one small, non-growing metastasis was imaged
aside from the seven lesions studied. If other metastases were present, they should have
grown to visible size during 10 years of follow-up. Therefore, the exponential model
provided the best estimate of the number of lung metastases. Our results emphasise
the importance of having correct tumour growth information to correctly estimate the
number and size distribution of metastases.
We evaluated the Gompertzian growth model in the present study because it is the
most commonly adopted model in clinical studies [7,8]; however, our approach is the￾oretically applicable to all growth models.
Conclusion
Analysis of the regression of tumour growth rate with its volume can be used to esti￾mate the non-exponential growth model parameters of metastatic tumours. These re￾sults are valuable for the optimisation of targeted radionuclide therapy based on the
estimated number and size distribution of metastases in individual patients.
