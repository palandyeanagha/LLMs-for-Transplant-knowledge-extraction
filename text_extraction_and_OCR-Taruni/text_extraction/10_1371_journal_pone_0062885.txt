Abstract
Background: The human gut microbiota has profound influence on host metabolism and immunity. This study
characterized the fecal microbiota in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The relationship between
microbiota changes and changes in hepatic steatosis was also studied.
Methods: Fecal microbiota of histology-proven NASH patients and healthy controls was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA
pyrosequencing. NASH patients were from a previously reported randomized trial on probiotic treatment. Proton-magnetic
resonance spectroscopy was performed to monitor changes in intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG).
Results: A total of 420,344 16S sequences with acceptable quality were obtained from 16 NASH patients and 22 controls.
NASH patients had lower fecal abundance of Faecalibacterium and Anaerosporobacter but higher abundance of
Parabacteroides and Allisonella. Partial least-square discriminant analysis yielded a model of 10 genera that discriminated
NASH patients from controls. At month 6, 6 of 7 patients in the probiotic group and 4 of 9 patients in the usual care group
had improvement in IHTG (P = 0.15). Improvement in IHTG was associated with a reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes
(R2 = 0.4820, P = 0.0028) and increase in Bacteroidetes (R2 = 0.4366, P = 0.0053). This was accompanied by corresponding
changes at the class, order and genus levels. In contrast, bacterial biodiversity did not differ between NASH patients and
controls, and did not change with probiotic treatment.
Conclusions: NASH patients have fecal dysbiosis, and changes in microbiota correlate with improvement in hepatic
steatosis. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanism underlying the interaction between gut microbes and
the liver.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common
chronic liver disease worldwide [1,2]. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) is the progressive form of NAFLD and can result in
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [3–5]. Because of the close
relationship between NASH and metabolic syndrome, NASH is
also strongly associated with cardiovascular disease [6,7].
While hepatic steatosis is the result of energy excess and
abnormal lipid metabolism, the mechanism leading to NASH and
liver injury is not completely understood. Several lines of evidence,
however, suggest that the ‘gut-liver axis’ may contribute signifi￾cantly to the pathogenesis of NASH. NAFLD/NASH patients
have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal
permeability [8]. They also have increased blood level of bacterial
endotoxin [9,10]. Endotoxin, also known as lipopolysaccharide, is
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62885

a major constituent of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria. Endotoxin and free fatty acids are known to induce
hepatic necroinflammation through its action on Toll-like
receptors [11,12]. Animal and small human studies show that
probiotics and prebiotics may ameliorate NASH [13–17].
The human gut is home to around 100 trillion commensal
organisms. The gut microbiome contains 10 times more genes
than the human host [18]. Current knowledge on the association
between gut microbiota composition and NASH is limited. Altered
gut microbiota is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes in
animals and humans [19–22]. Transplantation of gut microbiota
from normal mice to germ-free mice leads to substantial increase
in body weight and hepatic steatosis [23]. Furthermore, healthy
women receiving choline-deficient diet to induce fatty liver were
found to have altered fecal composition of Gammaproteobacteria and
Erysipelotrichi [24]. However, choline-deficient diet is a highly
artificial intervention and cannot reflect the situation of NASH
patients in the clinic. The gut microbiota composition of adult
NASH patients has not been systematically studied.
In this study, we determined fecal microbiota changes in NASH
patients. We also longitudinally studied the association between
changes in fecal microbiota and changes in hepatic steatosis with
time.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This was a preplanned analysis of a randomized controlled trial
in NASH patients. Details of the original trial have been reported
previously [17]. In brief, 20 NASH patients were randomized to
receive probiotic treatment (n = 10) or usual care (n = 10) for 6
months. Patients in the probiotic group received 1 sachet of
Lepicol probiotic and prebiotic formula (Healthy Bowels Compa￾ny Ltd, Birmingham, UK) twice a day. Each 10 g sachet contained
200 million probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC
14917), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus (ATCC 11842),
Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC 4356), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC
7469) and Bifidobacterium bifidum (ATCC 29521). Patients in the
usual care group did not receive probiotic. Both groups were
instructed to exercise for at least 90 minutes per week and
consume low carbohydrate, low fat diet at baseline. At baseline
and month 6, all patients underwent proton-magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (1
H-MRS) to measure intrahepatic triglyceride
content (IHTG) and provided fresh fecal samples. This study
focused on the fecal microbiota analysis of these NASH patients.
This was further compared with the fecal microbiota of healthy
volunteers without NAFLD.
Ethics
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The
Chinese University of Hong Kong (CRE-2008.258) and was
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00870012).
Patients
Cases were patients aged 18 to 70 years with histology-proven
NASH, defined as hepatic steatosis of more than 5% and
inflammation with hepatocyte ballooning [25]. Controls were
healthy volunteers with normal liver function tests and no history
of liver diseases. Subjects in both groups had negative hepatitis B
surface antigen, negative anti-hepatitis C virus antibody and anti￾nuclear antibody titer below 1/160. Subjects with significant
alcohol consumption (over 20 g per day in men or 10 g per day in
women), liver decompensation or malignancy, or secondary causes
of fatty liver (e.g. use of systemic steroids or methotrexate) were
also excluded. All subjects provided written informed consent.
Clinical Assessments
At baseline, anthropometric parameters including body weight,
body height and waist circumference were measured in NASH
patients and controls. Waist circumference was measured at a level
midway between the lower rib margin and iliac crest with the tape
all around the body in the horizontal position. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by body height
(m) squared. Blood was taken for liver biochemistry, glucose and
lipids after fasting for at least 8 hours. Liver biopsy was scored
according to the NASH Clinical Research Network system [26].
IHTG was measured by 1
H-MRS as described previously [27].
The whole body 3.0 Tesla scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, the
Netherlands) with an echo time of 40 ms and repetition time of
5000 ms was used. All control subjects had IHTG below 5%. All
the assessments were repeated at 6 months in the NASH group.
Stool Sample Preparation
Early morning stool samples from subjects and controls were
collected and stored at 280uC. 180 mg material was removed
from the surface and core of the frozen stool samples, mixed
manually, and the total DNA was purified by QIAamp DNA Stool
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc, Hilden, Germany). All microbial commu￾nity DNA samples were analyzed for 16S ribosomal RNA
sequences by pyrosequencing. For each sample, 2 ml DNA was
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using forward
primer (986F 59WACGCGARGAACCTTACC39) and reverse
primer (1390R 59TGACGGGCGGTGWGTAC39), which an￾nealed to V1–V2 variable regions of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA
gene [28,29]. The PCR products were separated by 2% agarose
gel electrophoresis, purified with the QIAquick PCR purification
Kit (Qiagen) before pyrosequencing using GS FLX system
(Genome Sequencer FLX system, 454 Life Sciences, Inc,
Bradford, CT, USA).
Tag and primer sequences were removed from the amplicon
reads. The sequences were then subject to quality screening, in
which those with length between 400 bp and 475 bp (constituting
.97.7% of reads), and with fewer than two ambiguity bases were
kept. These sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) by .97% similarity using UCLUST method in
USEARCH v4.01. The most abundant sequence from each OTU
was selected as a representative sequence and taxonomically
classified by matching against the annotated bacterial and archeal
16S rRNA sequence databases (N = 1,921,179) in RDP Release
10, Update 27 [30], using Ribosomal Database Project naı¨ve
Bayesian Classifier with a 80% confidence threshold [31]. The
sequences are available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sra?term = SRA049741.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were expressed in mean 6 standard
deviation or median (interquartile range) and compared between
the NASH and control groups using unpaired t test or Mann￾Whitney’s test as appropriate. Changes in continuous variables
from baseline to month 6 were assessed using paired t test.
Categorical variables were compared using x2 test or Fisher exact
test as appropriate. Statistical significance was taken as a two-sided
P value of less than 0.05.
Community richness and diversity in each sample was studied
by biodiversity indices including Shannon’s index, inverse
Simpson’s diversity, Pielou’s evenness, Chao-1 estimator comput￾ed from OTUs. These indices were estimated from a randomly
Fecal Microbiota in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis

rarefied dataset of 4,000 reads in each subject, because of their
dependence on the size of sequence set. Bray-Curtis dissimilarities
between samples were calculated and compared between different
subject groups. Biodiversity measures were done using vegan
package on R statistical program v2.11.1 (http://www.r-project.
org/).
Relative microbial abundance in the NASH and control groups
were compared at the phylum, class, order, family, genus, and
OTU levels. Unpaired and paired t tests were used to justify the
significant difference in biodiversity and the abundance of a
microbial lineage between control and patients and in patients
before and six months after intake of study medications,
respectively. Correlations between the changes of IHTG content
and abundances of bacterial groups were justified by Pearson’s
correlation tests using the R program.
Partial least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), implement￾ed in MetaboAnalyst, was performed to discriminate the microbial
community profiles between NASH and control subjects [32].
Autoscaling was applied. The NASH and healthy phenotypes
represented two classes and OTU abundances were the predicting
variables. Rare variables which were observed in ,3 subjects and
,5 reads in total were excluded from the analysis.
The OTU representative sequences were aligned using Infernal
v1.0.2 [33], which were then subject to maximum likelihood

phylogenetic analysis using FastTree v2.1 [34], with a general time
reversible nucleotide substitution model. From the maximum
likelihood phylogeny, the weighted and normalized UniFrac
distance between each pair of samples was estimated in Fast
UniFrac [35]. Principal component analysis was performed on the
UniFrac distance metric.
Results
Twenty NASH patients and 22 controls were enrolled from
March to September 2009. After excluding 4 NASH patients with
suboptimal sequencing quality, 16 NASH patients (7 from the
probiotic group and 9 from the usual care group) and 22 controls
were included in the final analysis. As expected, NASH patients
had higher BMI and waist circumference, and were more likely to

A total of 420,344 16S sequences with acceptable quality were
obtained, in which sufficient amount of DNA could be recovered.

OTUs was 41,843, with an average of 775 OTUs per sample
(range 285–1,280). The mean number of OTUs was 792 (512–
1,075) in NASH patients and 810 (315–1,280) in controls
(P = 0.80). The biodiversity indices and community distance
summarized from the microbiota of the two groups were not
significantly different (Table 2, Figure 1).
In both NASH patients and controls, Bacteroidetes (67.6% vs
61.0%, P = 0.13) was the most abundant phylum in the fecal
microbiota (Figure 2). The second most abundant phylum
Firmicutes was significantly more enriched in controls than NASH
patients (30.3% vs 22.3%, P = 0.029) (Figure 3). The order
Aeromonadales, the families Succinivibrionaceae and Porphyr￾omonadaceae, and the genera Parabacteroides and Allisonella were
more abundant in NASH patients than controls (Figure 3). On the
other hand, the class Clostridia, the order Clostridiales, and the
genera Faecalibacterium and Anaerosporobacter were less abundant in
NASH patients. Unclassified Firmicutes and Clostridiales were
also less abundant in NASH patients.

Principal component analysis based on the Unifrac distances,
which is a measure of phylogenetic relatedness between samples of
microbial taxa, demonstrated no clear distinction in the whole
microbial 16S sequence sets between controls and NASH (data not
shown), yet showed some degree of phylogenetic separation
between the Firmicutes sequences in controls and NASH patients
(Figure 4), which was in accord with the analysis of relative
abundance above.
The multivariate analysis method, PLS-DA, was used to identify
the key bacterial clades responsible for the differentiation between
control and NASH subjects. At the level of OTU abundance,
score plots based on the 2nd and 3rd components showed that the
two groups were well separated (Figure 5). The R2
Y of this model
at the first 3 components (with the best Q2
) was 0.94 and 0.98,
indicative of very good performance for the differentiation.
However, the low Q2 value (,0.1) of this model suggested a poor
performance of predicting the disease, which might be possibly
due to relatively small sample size of NASH patients. By fitting the
model to the abundance at the genus level, Q2 value was increased
to 0.43 at the first 3 components. In this model, the ten bacterial
genera with the highest variable importance in projection (VIP;
VIP = 2.0–1.1), which reflect the contribution to discrimination,
were Parabacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Anaerofilum, unclassified Succi￾nivibrionaceae, unclassified Porphyromonadaceae, Allisonella, Blautia,
Anaerosporobacter, Lachnobacterium and unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae.
Parabacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Allisonella and Anaerosporobacter were
also congruently identified by t-tests (Figure 3).
Fecal Microbiota and Changes in Hepatic Steatosis at
Month 6
All 16 NASH patients with good quality fecal microbiota
sequences had repeated fecal analysis at 6 months. IHTG
decreased by 4.065.5% in the probiotic group and 1.265.1%
in the usual care group by month 6 (P = 0.31). Six of 7 patients in
the probiotic group and 4 of 9 patients in the usual care group had
improvement in IHTG (P = 0.15). Details of the other treatment
outcomes have been reported previously [17]. As expected, paired
samples from the same groups had much less dissimilarity from
each other than samples from different groups (Figure 1). There
was no significant change in bacterial biodiversity over time in
both the probiotic group and the usual care group (Table 2).
In the probiotic group, changes in bacterial abundance towards
that of healthy controls were observed in the family Porphyr￾omonodaceae (from 6.6% to 4.9%; vs 4.7% in controls; P = 0.84),
its genus member Parabacteroides (from 6.1% to 4.3%; vs 3.7% in
controls; P = 0.48), and another genus Allisonella (belonging to the
Veillonellaceae family; from 0.09% to 0.05%; vs 0.02% in
controls; P = 0.46) (Figure 3). Nevertheless, there was no significant
increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium after
probiotic treatment (Figure 6).
Moreover, there was increased abundance of the order
Aeromonadales and the family Succinivibrionaceae in the usual
care group at month 6 (Figure 3). However, this was due to
exceptionally high abundance of Succinivibrionaceae (and hence
Aeromonadales; 4.6%) in 1 patient in the usual care group, which
was very different from the other patients (0–0.7%). Second, the
increased abundance of the genus Anaerosporobacter in the usual care
group at month 6 was due to its presence in 1 patient but absence
in all other NASH patients. The phenomenon was only observed
in 1 outlier and involved only low abundance bacteria, and should
therefore have limited pathological significance.
In addition, fecal microbiota changes in the 16 NASH patients
correlated with changes in IHTG at month 6. At the phylum level,
a reduction in IHTG was accompanied by a reduction in the
abundance of Firmicutes and an increase in Bacteroidetes
(Figure 7). Improvement in hepatic steatosis was also associated
with reduced abundance of the class Clostridia, the order
Clostridiales and the genus Faecalibacterium. In contrast, reduced
IHTG level was associated with increased abundance of the class
Bacteroidia and the order Bacteroidales.

Discussion
Cumulating data suggest that the human gut microbiota has
profound influence on host metabolism and immunity. In this
study, NASH patients demonstrated fecal dysbiosis but not
significant changes in biodiversity. In addition, changes in fecal
microbiota over time correlate with changes in hepatic steatosis.
With the recent development in molecular techniques, evalu￾ation of thousands of DNA sequences can be done rapidly and
accurately. The pyrosequencing method adopted in the current
study has been shown to be as reliable as cloning [36]. Gut
microbial dysbiosis is associated with various disorders such as
inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome [37,38].
Changes in gut microbiota have also been observed in obese
animals with NASH [39,40]. In our study, it is possible to
distinguish NASH patients and healthy people at the OTU level
based on a combination of 10 genera. Moreover, through a
longitudinal study design, we found that changes in the fecal
microbiota composition correlate well with the changes in hepatic
steatosis in 6 months. For instance, obese patients were found to
have higher abundance of Firmicutes and lower abundance of
Bacteroidetes in previous studies [19]. Echoing previous findings,
we found that NASH patients with improvement in hepatic
steatosis actually had reduced abundance of Firmicutes and
increased abundance of Bacteroidetes with time. On the other
hand, the abundance of Firmicutes was unexpectedly lower in

NASH patients than controls. It is unclear if the different pattern
may be due to different dietary compositions in Chinese subjects.
In a recent study, children with biopsy-proven NASH had
significant difference in gut microbiota from those with obesity
alone [41]. Both groups were in turn different from non-obese
controls. This suggests that gut microbiota may have specific
influence on the NASH phenotype. That said, it should be
highlighted that like all human association studies, causal
relationship cannot be firmly established despite a trend toward
dose-dependent relationship. Future animal studies are required to
establish the causal relationship and work out the mechanism of
the association.
At the genus level, Parabacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Allisonella and
Anaerosporobacter were consistently found to be different between
NASH patients and controls by t test and PLS-DA. Faecalibacterium
was reduced by more than half in NASH subjects. F. prausnitzii is
an anti-inflammatory commensal and is reduced in both patients
with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome
[37,38,42]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells have reduced
expression of interleukin-12 and interferon-gamma and increased
secretion of interleukin-10 when exposed to F. prausnitzii [42]. The
significance of the other microbes identified in this study warrants
further investigation.
Although probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in a
number of animal and human NASH studies, their mechanism of
action remains poorly understood [13–17]. In mouse studies,
probiotics reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and
suppress natural killer T cells in the liver [13,14,43]. Since NASH
is associated with endotoxemia, this may be another treatment
target by probiotics [11,12]. Based on our data, however,
modification of colonic microbiota is unlikely to be the mechanism
underlying the effect of probiotics. Ideally, biopsy samples along
different parts of the gastrointestinal tract may provide deeper
insights and are preferable to fecal samples. However, this would
require repeated small bowel enteroscopy and cannot be justified
in otherwise healthy individuals.
Our study has a few limitations. First, the sample size was
relatively small. However, we improved the breadth and depth of

Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were the two bacterial genera
contained in the probiotics used in this study. ‘C’, ‘P’, ‘Uc’ and ‘Tx’
refer to controls, NASH patients at baseline, NASH patient at 6 months
after usual care and treatment of probiotic, respectively. There is no
significant difference between each pair of study groups.

data by evaluating an average of almost 8,000 reads of 16S
sequences per sample. Our study is unique in having serial
assessment of hepatic steatosis and fecal microbiota. All NASH
patients also had liver biopsy at baseline. Furthermore, the
changes in major bacterial phyla observed in this study were in
accordance to the current understanding of the effect of those
microbes. Second, all subjects were ethnic Chinese and the
findings cannot be directly extrapolated to other populations.
However, substantial inter-individual variation in gut microbiota
exists even among people within the same nation [44]. While
further confirmatory studies from other countries are welcomed,
our study demonstrated the close relationship between gut
microbiota and NASH.
In conclusion, NASH patients have gut microbial dysbiosis, and
changes in microbiota correlate with improvement in hepatic
steatosis. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanism
underlying the interaction between gut microbes and the liver.
