Introduction
Anastomotic biliary stricture is the most common adverse
event (AE) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX), occur￾ring in 5 % to 19 % of patients [1 – 5]. The first-line approach to
this type of stricture involves endoscopic retrograde cholangio￾pancreatography (ERCP), with placement of multiple plastic
stents (MPSs) [6 – 9]. However, the benefits of using fully-cov￾ered self-expandable metallic stents (CSEMS) in this situation
are still being discussed [10 – 12]. The most significant draw￾back of using MPS is the number of ERCPs needed to complete
the treatment because the plastic stents have to be replaced
approximately every 3 months; the number and diameter of
the stents is increased until the stricture is resolved [7, 13].
CSEMS have been used to treat benign strictures with en￾couraging results because their removal is no longer a limiting
factor [10]. The initial premise is that only two ERCPs are need￾ed to treat the biliary anastomotic stricture after OLTX: one to
place the metallic stent and another to remove it, leading to
greater acceptance by patients and potentially lesser costs and
fewer AEs [13]. Case series with CSEMS have already demon￾strated the safety of these devices, and few studies on this topic

ABSTRACT
Background and study aims The first-line approach to
anastomotic biliary stricture after orthotopic liver trans￾plantation (OLTX) involves endoscopic retrograde cholan￾giopancreatography (ERCP). The most widely used tech￾nique is placement of multiple plastic stents, but discus￾sions are ongoing on the benefits of fully-covered self-ex￾pandable metallic stents (FCEMS) in this situation. This
study aimed to compare results from use of plastic and
metal stents to treat biliary stricture after transplantation.
Patients and methods Searches were performed in the
Medline, EMBASE, SciELO/LILACS, and Cochrane databases,
and only randomized studies comparing the two tech￾niques were included in the meta-analysis.
Results Our study included four randomized clinical trials
totaling 205 patients. No difference was observed be￾tween the stricture resolution rate (RD: 0.01; 95%CI
[−0.08 – 0.10]), stricture recurrence (RD: 0.13; 95 %CI
[−0.03 – 0.28]), and adverse events (RD: −0.10; 95 %CI
[−0.65 – 0.44]) between the plastic and metallic stent
groups. The metallic stent group demonstrated benefits
in relation to the number of ERCPs performed (MD: −1.86;
95%CI [−3.12 to −0.6]), duration of treatment (MD:
−105.07; 95 %CI [−202.38 to −7.76 days]), number of
stents used (MD: −10.633; 95 %CI [−20.82 to −0.44]), and
cost (average $ 8,288.50 versus $ 18,580.00, P < 0.001).
Conclusions Rates of resolution and recurrence of stric￾ture are similar, whereas the number of ERCPs performed,
number of stents used, duration of treatment, and costs
were lower in patients treated with FCEMS, which shows
that this device is a valid option for initial treatment of
post-OLTX biliary stricture.

have shown similar rates of treatment success, recurrence, and
AEs between the two types of treatment [14 – 17].
Therefore, the current systematic review and meta-analysis
evaluates all the randomized studies available in the literature
to compare use of MPS and CSEMS with regard to efficacy, safe￾ty, and cost in treating anastomotic biliary stricture after liver
transplantation.
Patients and methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed ac￾cording to the recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and registered in the
international PROSPERO database (CRD 42017068478) [18].
Eligibility criteria
Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing use of MPS
with CSEMS in initial treatment of anastomotic biliary stricture
after liver transplantation were included. There were no restric￾tions with regard to language. Inclusion criteria were patients
aged > 18 who underwent OLTX and had stricture of the biliary
anastomosis confirmed via cholangiography. Exclusion criteria
were recurrent biliary stricture, non-anastomosis biliary stric￾ture, and stricture in the hepatic hilum.
Search and selection of articles and collection of
data
Two independent researchers conducted the search, evaluated
and selected the articles; disagreements were resolved by con￾sensus. Databases searched were Medline (PubMed), EMBASE,
SciELO/LILACS, and Cochrane until October 2017. The search
strategy in Medline and EMBASE was “(Liver transplantation
OR Hepatic Transplantation OR Liver Grafting OR Hepatic Trans￾plantation) AND (biliary stricture OR biliary stenosis OR biliary
stenose OR ERCP OR plastic OR metallic OR stent OR cholangi￾ography OR cholangiopancreatography)”. The search strategy
in SciELO/LILACS and Cochrane was “Liver transplantation AND
biliary”.
Outcomes evaluated were as follows: number of ERCPs per￾formed, rate of stricture resolution, rate of stricture recurrence,
total treatment time, stent migration, cost, AEs, and number of
stents.
Risk of bias
Studies were individually evaluated with regard to proper ran￾domization, allocation concealment, number of losses below
20 %, relevant outcomes, presence of analysis by intention to
treat, risk bias table (RoB) tool recommended by Cochrane and
Jadad scale [19, 20]. The RoB tool assists in measuring biases
through evaluation of blinding, randomization, and informa￾tion on losses. Scores on Jadad scale range from 0 to 5, with
scores below 3 generally considered to represent studies of
low methodological quality. Evidence quality was analyzed ac￾cording to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, De￾velopment and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) [21].
Statistical measures and analysis
Dichotomous variables were analyzed using risk difference and
Mantel-Haenszel test, whereas continuous variables were ana￾lyzed using mean difference and inverse variance. The fixed ef￾fect model was preferred, but we used the random effect mod￾el when less than 50 % heterogeneity was not reached.
When studies reported medians and ranges, these were
transformed into mean and standard deviations using the for￾mula by Hozo et al. [22].
We used a 95 % confidence interval, and heterogeneity was
calculated using the method by Higgins (I-square).
Statistical analyses were performed with the RevMan 5 (Re￾view Manager Version 5.3.5, Cochrane Collaboration, London,
UK) and OpenEpi (Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for
Public Health) software. The relationship between sample size
and effect for each outcome was graphically analyzed using a
forest plot. Funnel plots were used to assess risk of publication
bias or inconsistency between the study outcomes.
For cost analysis, it was necessary to convert the data from
one study from Australian dollars to US dollars [13]. The ex￾change rate for the month of publication was used (January
2014). Then, we calculated the mean and standard deviation
to perform the Student’s t-test.
Treatment times expressed in months were converted to
days.
Results
Search
The literature search yielded 3,322 articles in Medline/PubMed,
2,447 in EMBASE, 127 in SciELO/LILACS, and 55 in Cochrane, to￾taling 5,951 articles. After repeated articles were excluded,
4,650 studies remained. Among these, four RCTs were found
that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-a￾nalysis, with a total of 205 patients (103 in the CSEMS group
and 102 in the MPS group). The article selection process is illu￾strated in ▶Fig. 1.
The four selected studies have similar characteristics (▶Ta￾ble 1) [10, 13, 23, 24]. CSEMS dwelling time ranged from 3 to 6
months and the interval to replace the plastic stents ranged
from 6 to 16 weeks. The study by Kaffes et al. [6] was the only
one that used metallic prostheses with greater diameter at the
ends and did not mention minimum follow-up time; the other
three studies [10, 23, 24] reported follow-up of at least 1 year.
Data were extracted from published material and there was no
need to access original data from the studies.
Biases and evidence quality
Risks of individual biases of the four studies were restricted to
double blinding, which was not possible because of the need
to evaluate the stricture when the stents are placed and re￾moved by the physician. In all studies, losses were less than
20 % and randomization, appropriate allocation, and analysis
by intention to treat were performed; consequently, their Jadad
score was 3 (▶Table 2). ▶Fig. 2 shows the RoB tool recommen￾Visconti Thiago A De C et al. Metallic vs plastic … Endoscopy International Open 2018; 06: E914–E923 E915

ded by Cochrane. The GRADE Summary of Findings for evidence
quality can be found in ▶Annex 2.
Outcomes
We were able to compare several outcomes, such as number of
ERCPs performed, stricture resolution, stricture recurrence,
treatment time, migration, AEs, costs, and number of stents
(▶Annex 3). Tal et al. [11] considered the result after the re￾quired crossovers (four in the CSEMS and three in the MPS
groups), whereas Martins et al. [13] considered a failure when
crossover was necessary. Because the number of crossovers
was similar and they all resulted in stricture resolution, we
agreed with the assessment by Tal et al. [11] to consider these
as successful cases.
Number of ERCPS performed
The four studies were included in the analysis of the number of
ERCPs performed, with a total of 205 patients. The number of
ERCPs necessary for treatment was lower (MD: −1.86; 95%CI
[−3.12 to −0.6]) in the patients in whom CSEMS were used. Het￾erogeneity observed in the analysis exceeded 50 %, and funnel
plot was used; no outliers were identified, and treatment het￾erogeneity was not possible; therefore, we used the random ef￾fect model for analysis (▶Fig. 3).

Review

Number of stents per patient
The number of stents per patient was lower (MD: −10.633; 95%
CI [−20.82 to −0.44]) in the patients in whom CSEMS were used.
Heterogeneity observed in the analysis exceeded 50 %, and be￾cause only two studies were involved, treatment heterogeneity
was not possible and it was necessary to use the random effect
model for the analysis (▶Fig. 4).
Stricture resolution
Four studies were included in analysis of the stricture resolu￾tion, with a total of 205 patients. There was no statistically sig￾nificant difference in the rate of stricture resolution between
the two groups, which showed equivalence for the initial suc￾cess of the treatment (RD: 0.01; 95 %CI [−0.08 – 0.10])
(▶Fig.5).
Stricture recurrence
No statistically significant difference was found between the
two groups in evaluation of the rate of recurrence in 181 pa￾tients who had successful initial stricture treatment (RD: 0.13;
95 %CI [−0.03 to 0.28]). The heterogeneity observed in the a￾nalysis exceeded 50 %, and funnel plot was used; no outliers
were identified and treatment heterogeneity was not possible;
therefore, we used the random effect model for the analysis
(▶Fig. 6).
Treatment time
Treatment time (number of days until all stents were removed)
was less in the CSEMS group (MD: −105.07; 95%CI [−202.38 to
−7.76 days]). Heterogeneity observed in the analysis exceeded
50 %, and funnel plot was used; no outliers were identified and
heterogeneity correction was not possible; therefore, the ran￾dom effect model was used for the analysis (▶Fig. 7).
Adverse events
Two studies were used in the analysis of AEs not related to mi￾gration, with a total of 84 patients. No statistically significant
difference was observed (RD: −0.10; 95%CI [−0.65 to 0.44]).
Heterogeneity observed in the analysis was greater than 50 %,
and the random effect model was used for the analysis
(▶Fig.8).
Stent migration was individually analyzed and involved two
studies with a total of 84 patients. Again, this analysis did not
demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the
materials (RD: −0.05; 95%CI [−0.18 to 0.08]).
Cost
Assessment of treatment cost included two studies [13, 24]
that reported the average cost of each treatment. Treatment
with CSEMS was less expensive than that with MPS (average of
$ 8,288.00 and $ 18,580.00, respectively; P < 0.001) (▶Fig. 9).

Discussion
Treatment of biliary stricture after liver transplantation with
CSEMS has aroused interest in follow-up of transplanted pa￾tients because traditional protocols with plastic stents have an
approximate duration of 1 year and several ERCPs are required
to complete treatment. A study with a high level of evidence is
still necessary [25], such as this meta-analysis including only
RCTs because new randomized trials are available in the litera￾ture, two of which [23, 24] were published recently (2017). This
thereby shows the need for and interest in determining wheth￾er CSEMS are adequate and yield results similar to MPSs. All
studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis
had adequate randomization and allocation, few losses, and
good quality.
As expected, the number of ERCPs was considerably lower in
the CSEMS cases because this treatment involves only two pro￾cedures, one to place the stent and another to remove it. This
result was consistent among studies, and this issue is already
considered to be resolved. Therefore, we need to know if fewer
ERCPs are associated with lower AE rates, lower costs, and
greater patient acceptance.
Similar to the number of ERCPs, duration of treatment was
also shorter in the CSEMS cases because most MPS protocols
last 1 year and CSEMS protocols last a maximum of 6 months.

Review

Stricture resolution was similar among all studies, with no
statistical difference, showing equivalence in initial treatment
success between the methods [10, 13, 23, 24]. However, as
stricture resolution after the initial treatment was determined
by cholangiography at time of stent removal, it is not likely to
be very informative concerning a relevant clinical endpoint be￾cause cholangiography at time of removal is very likely to have
improved enough to warrant stent removal.
Recurrence is one of the most debated issues in this topic.
Although it appears that the question of stricture resolution
has been answered, more information is still needed with re￾gard to recurrence. In this analysis, there was no statistical dif￾ference in rates of recurrence. However, the study by Martins et
al.[24] was the only one that showed a significantly higher rate
of recurrence in the CSEMS group, and the authors raised the
hypothesis that the shorter dwelling time of the CSEMS in the
bile duct (6 months) was responsible for the rate of recurrence
being higher in the CSEMS group than in the MPS group (dwell￾ing time of 12 months) in their study. Although this was not the
main objective of their study, Martins et al. [24] followed these
patients, and six of the eight patients who had recurrence after
CSEMS were successfully treated after a new endoscopic treat￾ment with MPS for 1 year. Cote et al. [10], Martins et al. [24],
and Tal et al. [23] clearly indicated a minimum follow-up period

of 1 year, whereas Kaffes et al.[13] did not report a minimum
follow-up period. Given the benign characteristics of the under￾lying disease and associated life expectancy, even a follow-up of
12 months is probably not enough to make firm assumptions
on long-term efficacy (especially in the CSEMS group because
more is known about the chance of recurrence in the MPS
group).
Another major concern is stent migration because a totally
covered CSEMS would be more likely to migrate, causing AEs
and affecting the final outcome of treatment. We did not find
statistical significant difference related to migration, but this a￾nalysis was performed taking into consideration the number of
patients instead of the number of stents used. Kaffes et al. [13]
used a specific metallic prosthesis with a larger diameter at the
ends, which may have reduced the number of migrations in
that study. The different types of stents used may limit overall
generalization. Migration of CSEMS does not seem to cause ma￾jor repercussions: Tal et al. [23] reported eight migrations of
CSEMS; four did not present further stricture (among these,
one patient had recurrence and was again treated with CSEMS
successfully) and the other four that still had stricture crossed
over to the MPS group.
Data related to AEs are scarce, and the studies that mention
them [13, 24] do not clarify whether any patient presented
more than one AE. Both procedures are relatively safe and do
not have AE rates that prevent their execution. The rate of pan￾creatitis after CSEMS decreases considerably when papillotomy
is performed, and this procedure is also indicated for deploy￾ment of CSEMS [24].
The most unexpected result, which is an argument in favor
of use of CSEMS, was related to costs. Treatment with CSEMS
was widely believed to be more expensive because of the costs
of the stents [23], but the current study showed, via a meta-a￾nalysis of two studies on different continents (Kaffes et al. [13]
and Martins et al. [24]), that use of CSEMS was consistently ad￾vantageous, with a cost that was less than half of that of the
MPS treatment (average of $ 8,288.50 versus $ 18,580.00,
respectively; P < 0.001).
One of the limitations was the way each study was analyzed.
Martins et al. [24] considered the need for crossover as treat￾ment failure whereas Tal et al. [23] did not consider this as fail￾ure and conducted the analysis by intention to treat at the end.
However, Tal et al. [23] had a similar number of crossovers in
both groups (four crossovers from CSEMS to MPS and three
from MPS to CSEMS) and all cases resulted in stricture resolu￾tion; therefore, we don’t believe that crossover affected the fi￾nal analysis.
Diagnosis and treatment success were determined by as￾sessment of cholangiography, and none of the studies estab￾lished a relationship between diagnosis and resolution of biliary
stricture and laboratory tests (hepatobiliary enzymes).
The different types of stents used and the 1-year follow-up
can reveal unreliable data once it affects the migration rate
and recurrence rate.
Data on AEs are scarce, and because some studies reported
only some AEs, these could not be comprehensively included in
the meta-analysis.
This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to in￾clude only randomized studies on this topic with an adequate
number of patients (205). It showed statistical differences
with regard to several outcomes, thereby answering several
questions related to this topic.
Conclusion
Rates of resolution and recurrence of biliary stricture after liver
transplantation were similar, and the number of ERCPs per￾formed, number of stents used, duration of treatment, and
costs were lower in the CSEMS group than in the MPS group.
These results show that use of CSEMS is a valid option for initial
treatment of post-OLTX anastomotic biliary stricture. Whether
it should be standard of care should ideally depend on larger
RCTs with adequate follow-up (i. e. 2 years or longer) and one
type of stent.
