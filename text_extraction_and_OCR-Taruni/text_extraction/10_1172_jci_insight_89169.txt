Introduction
Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), a subset of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), is 
a common cause of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (1). IDC is characterized 
by pathologic remodeling consisting of a reduction in systolic function and the development of eccen￾tric ventricular myocardial hypertrophy accompanied by molecular and cellular changes that include 
the activation of a myocyte gene network under the control of β1
-adrenergic receptor (β1
-AR) signal￾ing (2, 3). This β1
-AR gene signaling network, or β1
-GSN, includes elements of the canonical fetal/
adult gene program (FGP) (4–6), a hallmark of cardiac myocyte pathologic hypertrophy defined by the 
downregulation of the adult genes encoding α-myosin heavy chain (MyHC, MYH6) and sarcoplasmic 
reticulum calcium-ATPase 2a (Serca 2a, ATP2A2), and upregulation of β-MyHC (MYH7) and the natri￾uretic peptides ANP (NPPA) and BNP (NPPB) (7, 8). In addition to changes in the expression of coding 
RNAs, expression of microRNAs (miRs) is also altered in human IDC. We and others have previously 
identified miRs that are differentially regulated in IDC patients (9–11).
miRs are 20–22 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that play an important role in regulating gene expres￾sion, through recognition of complementary sequences in the 3′ UTR of target genes. miRs promote 
repression of target genes through mRNA degradation or translation repression (10, 11). Furthermore, 
BACKGROUND. In dilated cardiomyopathies (DCMs) changes in expression of protein-coding 
genes are associated with reverse remodeling, and these changes can be regulated by microRNAs 
(miRs). We tested the general hypothesis that dynamic changes in myocardial miR expression are 
predictive of β-blocker–associated reverse remodeling.
METHODS. Forty-three idiopathic DCM patients (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 0.24 ± 0.09) 
were treated with β-blockers. Serial ventriculography and endomyocardial biopsies were performed 
at baseline, and after 3 and 12 months of treatment. Changes in RT-PCR (candidate miRs) or array￾measured miRs were compared based on the presence (R) or absence (NR) of a reverse-remodeling 
response, and a miR-mRNA-function pathway analysis (PA) was performed.
RESULTS. At 3 months, 2 candidate miRs were selectively changed in Rs, decreases in miR-208a-3p 
and miR-591. PA revealed changes in miR-mRNA interactions predictive of decreased apoptosis and 
myocardial cell death. At 12 months, 5 miRs exhibited selective changes in Rs (decreases in miR￾208a-3p, -208b-3p, 21-5p, and 199a-5p; increase in miR-1-3p). PA predicted decreases in apoptosis, 
cardiac myocyte cell death, hypertrophy, and heart failure, with increases in contractile and overall 
cardiac functions.
CONCLUSIONS. In DCMs, myocardial miRs predict the time-dependent reverse-remodeling 
response to β-blocker treatment, and likely regulate the expression of remodeling-associated miRs.

CLINICAL MEDICINE
miRs can be important biomarkers of disease specificity and progression. A myocardial miR signature 
may distinguish IDC from ischemic cardiomyopathy, and expression of a subset of miRs is normalized 
in patients after left ventricular assisted device (LVAD) support (9, 12).
Chronic β1
-AR activation is known to be an important component of pathologic remodeling (2, 13, 
14), and β-blockers, whose common target is the myocardial β1
-AR, are a highly clinically effective treat￾ment of HFrEF (13), owing in part to their reverse-remodeling effects (15). We have recently described the 
β-blocker reverse-remodeling mRNA expression profile in a longitudinal study in IDC patients treated with 
3 different regimens of AR antagonists that have in common high affinity competitive antagonism of the 
β1
-AR (2). In that study (β-blocker Effect On Remodeling and Gene Expression Trial [BORG]) (2), changes 
in gene expression from right ventricular septal endomyocardial biopsies were analyzed based on improve￾ment in left ventricle (LV) structure and function. Quantitative PCR and array results demonstrated that 
patients who responded to β-blocker therapy by reverse remodeling displayed changes in the expression of 
genes in the categories of contractile proteins, calcium handling, and adrenergic and metabolic signaling 
including the FGP. All the genes that exhibited changed expression in reverse-remodeled LVs were under 
β1
-AR regulation, and nearly all of them fit into the FGP paradigm (2, 3).
In the current report we test the general hypothesis that changes in miR abundance predict β-blocker–
associated reverse remodeling, by regulating the expression of remodeling-associated protein-encod￾ing genes. In the BORG study, miR expression in the subgroup that responded to β-blocker treatment 
(Responders, Rs) was compared longitudinally with patients who did not respond (Non-Responders, NRs). 
In addition to identifying the miR expression profile that accompanies reverse remodeling, we define a sub￾set of miRs that can be highly predictive of response to β-blockers. Furthermore, the mRNA array dataset 
was used to identify possible miR targets, and to define miR-mRNA-related pathways altered in response 
to inhibition of β1
-AR signaling.
Results
Patient treatment and RNA samples
A detailed description of the 47 IDC patients investigated in BORG has been published (2). The current 
miR cohort consists of 43 of these 47 subjects who had miR measurements by either RT-PCR or array. One 
patient (metoprolol-treated) appears in the current analysis that was not in the previous study (2), owing to 
insufficient RNA for mRNA analyses. As described in Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material avail￾able online with this article; doi:10.1172/jci.insight.89169DS1, RT-PCR measurement of candidate miRs 
was performed in 117 samples from 41 patients: baseline, n = 41; 3 months, n = 41 (32 R and 9 NR); 12 
months, n = 35 (24 R and 11 NR). miR array measurement was performed in 86 samples from 31 patients 
including 2 patients who did not have RT-PCR measurements: baseline, n = 31; 3 months, n = 31 (24 R 
and 7 NR); 12 months, n = 24 (14 R and 10 NR). mRNA array measurement was performed in 115 RNA 
samples from 42 patients: baseline, n = 42; 3 months, n = 39 (R = 30, NR = 9); 12 months, n =34, including 
2 subjects that did not have 3-month samples measured (R = 23, NR = 11). The baseline characteristics of 
patients included in the miR cohort is given in Supplemental Table 2. There were no differences between 
the patients in the miR cohort and the previously reported (2) entire cohort, including no differences in 
background HF therapy.
Expression of several miRs is differentially regulated in LVEF Responders
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reverse-remodeling Rs were defined, as previously described (2), 
as an increase in LVEF by greater than or equal to 0.05 at 3 months or by greater than or equal to 0.08 at 
12 months. Failure to achieve these increases defined NRs. To determine if response to β-blockers affected 
miR expression, RT-PCR and array measurements were performed in RNA extracted from endomyocardial 
biopsies at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. miR expression was compared with 
baseline for each individual patient, and comparison between Rs and NRs was performed at 3 and 12 months.
RT-PCR. For candidate miRs measured by RT-PCR (Figure 1A), at 3 months changes from baseline in 
miR-591 were increased in Rs versus NRs (P = 0.007) and decreased in NRs (P = 0.013 compared with base￾line), and miR-208a-3p was decreased compared with baseline in Rs (P = 0.004) but not in NRs (P = 0.79). At 
12 months (Figure 1B), expression of miR-21-5p was significantly decreased in Rs versus NRs (P = 0.0005) and 
compared with baseline (P = 0.001). In Rs, miR-1-3p was increased compared with baseline (P = 0.002) and

NRs (P = 0.007), and miR-199a-5p and 208a-3p were selectively decreased compared with baseline and with 
NRs. Thus, miR-208a-3p was the only miR selectively changed in Rs at 3 and 12 months, and was decreased 
at both time points. In addition, compared with baseline miR-208b-3p was decreased in Rs at 12 months (P = 
0.002) but not in NRs (P = 0.12). There were also selective changes from baseline in miRs in the NR groups at 
3 months and 12 months (data not shown in Figure 1). At 3 months, miR-199-5p, -145-5p, -494-3p, -591, and 
-342-5p were significantly (P < 0.05) changed from baseline in NRs but not in Rs (P > 0.10), with miR-199-5p, 
-145-5p, -591, and -342-5p increasing and miR-494-3p and -591 decreasing. At 12 months in NRs, miR-494-3p 
and -378-3p were increased (P < 0.05) compared with baseline, with no change in Rs. For the reference RNAs, 
the abundance of neither miR-103a nor U6 was changed from baseline levels, in either Rs or NRs.
Array. Tables 1 and 2 and the heat map in Figure 2 contain array miR data, performed to generate 
supportive and hypothesis-generating data on an approximate 75% subset of patients who had RT-PCR 
measurements. The data were analyzed the same way as for RT-PCR, except there was no correction for 
multiplicity of measured values. In the array data, miR-135a-3p and -585-3p are selectively decreased in 
Rs at both 3 and 12 months, while miR-7-1-3p, -422a, -378a-5p, and -490-3p are selectively increased at 
3 and 12 months. miR-596 is selectively decreased in NRs at both time points, and miR-10b-3p, -99a-5p, 
-214-5p, 361-3p, and -1256 exhibit antithetical directional changes at 3 and 12 months. In terms of agree￾ment between RT-PCR and array findings, there were no significant changes in the array that matched the 
RT-PCR changes at 3 months, but at 12 months there were similar findings between array and RT-PCR for 
miR-199a-5p and -1-3p. In terms of directionality of R versus NR changes, at 3 months array results were 
in agreement with RT-PCR for 14 of the 19 RT-PCR measured miRs, and at 12 months the agreement was 
11 of 19. Six of the 19 candidate miRs measured by RT-PCR were statistically significant by array at either 
3 or 12 months, and 4 of the 6 exhibited directional R versus NR agreement.
On array data, random forest (RF) analysis was performed to distinguish R from NR patients at 3 and 
12 months (Figure 3, A and B, respectively). RF analysis was performed with the top 7 miRs (as determined 
by multidimensional scaling — Figure 4) that were statistically different (P < 0.05) between Rs and NRs. 
As previously described (16), miR expression in Rs was considered different than that in NRs if mean 
expression was ± 2 standard deviations from the mean and was statistically different from changes in NRs. 
Classification performances to discriminate Rs and NRs at 3 and 12 months were reported in multidimen￾sional scaling of the estimated proximity matrix plots (Figure 4). In Figure 4, the rank of the top miRs is 
displayed, with miR-378-5p, -493-5p, -494-3p, -202-3p, and -422a constituting the top 5.

To determine the ability of these miRs to accurately separate patients according to treatment 
response, hierarchical clustering was performed using the top 7 miRs as determined by RF analysis. As 
shown in Figure 5, a high degree of clustering was observed based on response to treatment at 3 and 
12 months. Next, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine if the top

7 miRs can predict response to treatment (Figure 6). An AUC of 0.98 (3 months) and 1.0 (12 months) 
demonstrates a strong association between miR expression and response to β-blocker treatment.
Pathway analysis
Possible associations of changes in miR expression with mRNA expression related to myocardial 
pathophysiology were assessed. Predicted miR target mRNAs significantly up- or downregulated in 
Rs compared with NRs were subjected to ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Figure 7). At 3 months, 
changes in expression of predicted mRNA targets in Rs versus NRs indicated a pattern associated 
with a significant decrease in apoptosis (P = 0.004, Z score = –0.54) and cardiac myocyte cell death (P
= 0.0019, Z score = –0.334). However, changes in predicted target mRNA expression also predicted 
an increase in myocardial hypertrophy (P = 0.005, Z score = 0.749), a decrease in contractile func￾tion (P = 0.035, Z score = –1.195), and a trend towards HF (P = 0.09, Z score = 1.64) (Figure 7A). 
At 12 months, target mRNA expression changes in Rs versus NRs predicted an increase in cardiac 
contractility (P = 0.0035, Z score = 1.414) and overall cardiac function (P = 0.001, Z score = 0.376), 
and decreases in myocardial hypertrophy (P = 0.000004, Z score = –0.969) and HF (P = 0.03, Z score 
= –0.387) (Figure 7B). Furthermore, at 12 months, target mRNA expression changes associated with 
apoptosis and necrosis were predicted to be significantly decreased in Rs (P = 0.0015, Z score = –0.283; 
P = 0.00297, Z score = –0.666; respectively).
Radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) data, miR combined cohort
RNV data revealed no differences between the 3 treatment groups in the R/NR response rate (R/NR, 
[R rate in %]) at 3 months: carvedilol 9/5 (60%), metoprolol 14/1 (93%), metoprolol + doxazosin 10/4 
(71%); 12 months: carvedilol 8/6 (57%), metoprolol 11/4 (73%), metoprolol + doxazosin 10/4 (71%) 
(contingency table P = 0.56). RNV data for the combined miR cohort are given in Table 3. In Rs the 
median increases [interquartile range] in LVEF at 3 months and 12 months were 0.13 [0.08, 0.23] and 
0.22 [0.16, 0.29], respectively (P < 0.001 for each). NRs had no significant change in LVEF at either 
time point. At 3 months there was no difference between Rs and NRs in end diastolic volume (EDV; 
P = 0.29) or end systolic volume (ESV; P = 0.09). However, decreases compared with baseline in both 
ventricular volumes were greater (P < 0.05) in Rs compared with NRs. At 12 months, both EDV and 
ESV were decreased in Rs compared with NRs (respective P values 0.015 and 0.010), with significant 
(P < 0.05) changes compared with baseline that were greater at 12 months (3- vs. 12-month respective 
decreases in EDV by 19% and 39%, ESV by 39% and 57%).

Discussion
Changes in miR expression are associated with response to β-blocker treatment. Previous work from our and other 
laboratories indicated that IDC and ischemic cardiomyopathy forms of HFrEF can be distinguished based 
on cardiac miR expression (9), and in ischemic but not in DCM, altered expression of a subset of miRs is 
changed towards normal values in patients after LVAD support (12). These results suggest an association 
between miR expression, myocardial disease type, and response to therapy. The results presented here indi￾cate that changes in miR expression are highly associated with the reverse-remodeling response to β-blocker 
treatment in DCM and IDC patients. Hierarchical clustering and RF analysis demonstrated that a subset of 
miRs can segregate patients based on treatment response. Importantly, if confirmed these miRs may serve 
as biomarkers for predicting response to treatment at 3 or 12 months. Therefore, miRs have the potential to 
inform treatment for HFrEF patients.
Treatment duration affects miR expression. Although response to treatment resulted in changes in miR 
expression, the changes were dependent on treatment duration. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, some miRs 
were regulated at both 3 and 12 months, but several were uniquely regulated at each time point. Impor￾tantly, the top 7 miRs as determined by RF analysis applied to array data were uniquely regulated at 3 or 
12 months. This is consistent with IPA results in which genes regulated at 3 and 12 months were predicted 
to differentially affect ventricular myocardial functional response. The initial response to β-blocker treat￾ment as measured at 3 months may be the beginning of favorable structural myocardial effects, accom￾panied by relatively small effects on ventricular function (15, 17). As treatment progresses, there is a 
time-dependent improvement in ventricular function (15, 17) that is likely mediated by different biologic 
processes including different miRs.
Myocardial remodeling and changes in gene expression. We have previously reported that reversal of myocar￾dial remodeling in response to β-blockers results in changes in the expression of genes responsible for calci￾um handling, contractile proteins, energy substrate use, and β-adrenergic signaling (2). In the current study 
we asked if reverse remodeling was also associated with changes in expression of miRs. Because miRs are 
predicted to regulate the expression of over 60% of mRNAs (18), it is likely that many of the previously 
observed changes in mRNA expression (2) are miR regulated. Based on changes in mRNA expression that

are predicted targets of differentially regulated miRs, IPA predicted a gene expression pattern associated 
with a decrease in cardiac hypertrophy at 12 months in R patients, which is supported by a statistically 
significant and substantial decrease in EDV. However, at 3 months in Rs versus NRs, IPA predicted a pat￾tern associated with an increase in hypertrophy, and RNV-measured EDV was not different. Although 
changes from baseline in EDV at 3 months indicated statistically significant decreases in Rs versus NRs, 
these changes were substantially greater at 12 months. Interestingly, by IPA cardiac contractile function was 
predicted to be increased in Rs at 12 months, corroborated by a large (57%) decrease (P = 0.010 vs. NRs) 
in ESV, an index of systolic function (19). At 3 months, IPA suggested a decrease in contractile function in 
Rs versus NRs and ESV was not decreased. Similarly, a decrease in HF was only predicted at 12 months, 
which was associated with a decrease in necrosis and apoptosis. These results suggest that reverse remodel￾ing is time dependent, with 3 months of treatment affecting cell death processes, but 12 months of treat￾ment resulting in substantial improvement in cardiac contractile function, decrease in hypertrophy, and

decrease in HF. Thus, the molecular patterns of miR and mRNA changes reflect what has been observed 
for β-blocker reverse-remodeling effects (15, 17), and are generally consistent with the RNV data in the cur￾rent study. These observations indicate that the changes in miRs and mRNAs measured in this study are 
related to the structural and functional reverse-remodeling effects produce by inhibition of β1
-AR signaling.
Response to treatment positively affects expression of a subset of candidate miRs. Time- and remodeling-asso￾ciated changes in candidate miR expression changes were identified by RT-PCR (Figure 1). At 3 months 
miR-591, which has antiproliferative or suppressor activity in tumor models (20, 21), exhibited increased 
expression in Rs compare with NRs. miR-494-3p expression was decreased in NRs at 3 months, and 
increased miR-494 expression is thought to be cardioprotective through activation of the AKT pathway 
(22). It is possible that this decrease in miR-494-3p expression contributed to nonresponse at 3 months, but 
at 12 months miR-494-3p expression was increased in NRs. miR-208a-3p was substantially and selectively 
decreased in Rs compared with baseline at 3 and 12 months, and decreased compared with NRs at 12 
months. In model systems therapeutic inhibition of miR-208a prevents cardiac remodeling and improves 
cardiac function (23). Furthermore, increased miR-208a levels have been associated with adverse clinical 
outcomes in human HF (24).
At 12 months all the statistically significant RT-PCR–measured candidate miRs that were changed 
from baseline in Rs and not in NRs or in Rs versus NRs are known to be involved in cardiac hypertro￾phy/failure, as described below. Moreover, the directionality of change in Rs is substantiated by previ￾ously published results in model systems. In addition to miR-208a-3p, miR-21-5p expression was down￾regulated in Rs versus baseline values and versus NRs at 12 months. miR-21 inhibition reduces fibrosis 
(25, 26). miR-1-3p expression was increased in Rs versus baseline, and in NRVMs increased miR-1 
levels attenuate hypertrophy-induced increases in cell size and expression of hypertrophic markers (27). 
In addition, miR-1 blocks β-adrenergic–mediated hypertrophy in adult mouse hearts through target-spe￾cific repression of calmodulin and NFAT activity, plus repression of the hypertrophic transcription fac￾tor MEF2 (27). miR-199a-5p was downregulated in Rs versus baseline and versus NRs, and decreased 
levels of miR-199a-5p are associated with the attenuation of pathologic cardiac myocyte hypertrophy 
(28), as well as in the induction of physiologic hypertrophy and maintenance of cardiac homeostasis 
(29). miR-208b-3p, selectively decreased in Rs compared with baseline at 12 months, is involved in the 
mediation of myocardial hypertrophy (30). Moreover, previous work indicated that expression of miR￾21, miR-1, and miR-199a-5p is modulated by isoproterenol infusion in a rat model (31). In addition, our

previous published work demonstrated upregulation of miR-21 and miR-199a-5p, and downregulation 
of miR-1-3p in mice overexpressing human β1
-ARs (8); these changes are, as expected, opposite to the 
response to β-blocker treatment shown here. Furthermore, in a mouse model of isoproterenol infusion, 
downregulation of miR-21 prevented cardiac dysfunction (32). These studies point to a β-AR–mediated 
regulation of these miRs, and are consistent with expression of these miRs in response to β-blockers.
Relationship of findings to previous work. miR-1-3p (by RT-PCR at 12 months) and miR-10b-3p (by array 
at 3 and 12 months) exhibited increases in expression in Rs versus NRs, which is in agreement with our 
previous report of downregulation of these miRs in IDC (9). Similarly, a decrease in miR-195-3p by array 
at 12 months in Rs versus NRs is in agreement with upregulation of this miR in IDC (9). On array, no 
changes in Rs versus NRs were detected in miR-150, -92a, -133a, or -133b, despite previously reported 
evidence of downregulation in IDC versus nonfailing controls (9), and in the case of miR-133a, a role in 
modulation of β1
-AR downstream signaling (33). No changes on array were observed in Rs versus NRs 
for miR-100 and -125b, despite upregulation in IDC (9). Decreases in miR-342-5p and -224-5p were noted 
in Rs versus NRs on array at 3 and 12 months, respectively, despite no changes reported in IDC hearts 
versus nonfailing controls (9). Finally, of a group of miRs (miR-125a-5p, -125b-5p, -150, 199a-3p, and 
-214-5p) reported to effect biased β1
-AR/β-arrestin-1 signaling (34), only miR-214-5p was changed in Rs 
versus NRs, downregulated at 12 months on array. Carvedilol has been reported to selectively upregulate 
these miRs, but the relatively small sample size within the carvedilol treatment group (for arrays, 7 Rs and 
3 NRs) precluded any ability to detect an R versus NR difference.
Limitations. There are limitations to the current study. miRs can target gene expression at the transcrip￾tional and translational levels. By analyzing mRNA expression to identify miR targets, it is likely that some 
targets were missed. However, the current study presents an initial evaluation of the possible function of 
miRs that are involved in the reverse-remodeling response to β-blocker treatment of HFrEF. In addition, 
mRNAs included in the analysis are predicted targets for these miRs. Future studies are needed to confirm 
if these miRs affect the expression of these mRNA targets.
Although our results indicate that a subset of miRs can be predictive of response to treatment, based 
on their invasive nature, endomyocardial biopsies are not likely to become routine practice for predict￾ing if a patient is likely to respond to therapy. However, miRs are also present in the circulation, and this

study may guide the choice of miRs analyzed in the serum or plasma in future studies of potential bio￾markers of reverse remodeling. In support of our findings, decreased expression of circulating miR-378 is 
highly associated with left ventricular hypertrophy in aortic stenosis patients (35); circulating miR-208a 
levels are acutely increased in a rat model of isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury (36); and a decrease in 
miR-1 expression and an increase in miR-21 expression has been observed in the serum of symptomatic 
HF patients (37). Directionality of expression of these miRs in these studies is antithetical to a positive 
response to β-blocker treatment in the myocardium, and strongly supports the use of these miRs as circulat￾ing biomarkers of response in patients.
We measured miRs by both RT-PCR and array, and there was an overall poor correlation between 
findings using these 2 methodologies. Of the 19 RT-PCR–measured candidate miRs, only 2 (miR-199a￾5p and -1-3p) were similarly changed in Rs versus NRs on RT-PCR and array. Less than ideal correla￾tion between RT-PCR and array measurements of miRs has been described by others (38), and may be 
attributed to methodological issues or in our case array measurements being performed in only a subset 
of samples that had RT-PCR performed. In addition, in our study the discrepancies between RT-PCR 
and array involve statistical significance over time or in changes in Rs versus NRs, which adds addi￾tional sources of non-agreement related to variance across multiple human samples. Overall, we view 
both the RT-PCR and array-specific findings as being hypothesis generating, and needing confirmation 
in subsequent studies.
Conclusions. In support of the study’s general hypothesis we conclude that changes in the miR abun￾dance predict β-blocker–associated reverse remodeling, by regulating the expression of remodeling￾associated protein-encoding genes. We demonstrated that miR expression changes are highly associated 
with the reverse-remodeling response to β-blocker treatment, and may be involved in the molecular 
mechanisms that effect decreases in hypertrophy, increases in cardiac function, and decreased cell 
death. Several studies have suggested that miRs can be therapeutically targeted in a multitude of dis￾eases including myocardial hypertrophy (23, 39). Importantly, directionality of change in expression 
of several miRs identified in this study has been associated with a reverse in pathological hypertrophy 
in animal models. Although further investigations in the human heart and in model systems will be 
required to confirm the specific reverse-remodeling-associated miRs described in the current study, this 
is possibly the first demonstration that changes in myocardial miR expression are dynamically asso￾ciated with a remodeling response in human HFrEF. Finally, these data suggest that miRs could be 
important therapeutic targets for HF treatment.
Methods
Study Design
Detailed information on the study design for the entire 47-patient trial (BORG, NCT01798992) has been 
previously published (2). Briefly, in the miR cohort patients were randomized open label to commercially 
available formulations of carvedilol (COREG, n = 14), metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL, n = 15) or 
metoprolol succinate + doxazosin mesylate (CARDURA, n = 14), which have in common blockade of 
β1
-ARs. The general hypothesis tested in the current study was that changes in miRs are associated with 
reverse remodeling and the previously described changes in mRNA that can be characterized as belonging 
to a β1
-GSN, and miR changes are potentially distinct between early (3 months) and later (12 months) time 
points. As in the previous report of mRNA expression changes associated with reverse-remodeling Rs or 
NRs, data from the 3 treatment arms were collectively evaluated.
Endomyocardial biopsy
Endomyocardial biopsies were performed as previously described (2) from the distal right ventricular sep￾tum at baseline (no treatment), and 3 and 12 months after treatment initiation. There were no procedural 
complications of biopsy.
RNV
LVEF and ventricular volumes were measured by RNV with SPECT imaging (2). The primary outcome 
was a positive LVEF reverse-remodeling response (R) defined as greater than or equal to 8 ejection fraction 
units at 12 months and greater than or equal to 5 ejection fraction units at 3 months (2). Nonresponse (NR) 

insight.jci.org   doi:10.1172/jci.insight.89169 1 3
CLINICAL MEDICINE
was defined as not meeting LVEF positive-response criteria, or the occurrence of heart transplantation, 
LVAD placement, or death (2). If RNV data were missing at 12 months (n = 8), then the 3-month value was 
carried forward, using the R/NR response criteria (2).
RNA extraction
Biopsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. Samples from each patient were 
processed concomitantly. Total RNA was extracted using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, 
Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, with the exception that the Lysis/Binding Buffer 
used for tissue homogenization was replaced with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Genomic contamination was elimi￾nated by treatment with DNase (TURBO DNA-free Kit, Ambion, Inc.).
miR measurements by RT-PCR and array
RT-PCR. miRs potentially associated with the primary reverse-remodeling outcome were identified statisti￾cally as described in the Statistics section below. Candidate miRs were preselected for measurement by RT￾PCR on the basis of either: (a) having been associated with biologic processes known or likely to be impor￾tant in remodeling (hypertrophy, contractile dysfunction, apoptosis, fibrosis, regeneration, inflammation, or 
autophagy, n = 13, miR-1-3p, -21-5p, -98-5p, -143-3p, -145-5p, -181a-2-3p, -199a-5p, -208a-3p, -208b-3p, -320d, 
-378-3p, -494-3p, and -499a-5p, six of which had also been shown to be modified by β1
-AR signaling); (b) 
associated with non-remodeling biologic processes (n = 6, miR-302d-5p, -342-3p, -342-5p, -423-3p, -591, and 
-1260a); or (c) as a reference RNA (miR-103a and the small nuclear RNA S6). RNA for RT-PCR was ali￾quoted first, and then remaining RNA was subjected to array analysis. No RT-PCR measurements were based 
on array data, as the measurements were generated in parallel.
Of the 41 patients with RT-PCR measurements, RNA starting material was insufficient in two 3-month 
samples and two 12-month samples. Endomyocardial biopsies were unavailable in an additional six 12-month 
patients due to study withdrawal (n = 2), patient relocation to another state (n = 2), death (n = 1), or insufficient 
biopsy sample (n = 1) (2). Thus, for RT-PCR miR measurements 41 patients had baseline and 3-month assess￾ments and 35 also had 12-month measurements.
RT-PCR was performed in duplicate for each individual sample, as previously described (40). Abun￾dance data for each of the 19 candidate miRs were normalized to the geometric mean of the fold changes of 
the 2 reference RNAs (41).
Array. For miR measurements by array, RNA starting material was insufficient for 12 of the 41 RT￾PCR–measured patients, and in 2 patients there was adequate RNA for array but not for RT-PCR. Thus, 
31 patients had miR measurements by array at baseline and 3 months. The 12-month array miR measure￾ments were on 24 patients, with missing values arising for the same reasons as in the RT-PCR cohort 
plus an additional patient with an insufficient RNA amount. Broad-based miR measurements were per￾formed in parallel with the candidate miR RT-PCR measurements, by array, using the 846-miR Affymetrix 
GeneChip miRNA Array v1.0 (miRBase version 11).
mRNA measurements by array
mRNA array analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array as 
previously described (2), on 42 of the 43 subjects in the miR cohort.
Statistics
RT-PCR measurements. Three-month or 12-month changes from baseline values within R or NR groups were 
assessed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and differences in the fold-change values between Rs and NRs 
at 3 or 12 months were determined by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (2). Missing values were interpolated from 
the mean values of the available other patients’ measurements relative to the patient’s measured value at the 
other time point (42). Hochberg multiple test correction was performed on P values for each group (43). A 
Hochberg corrected P less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for the R versus NR comparisons. 
For the within-group fold changes, a Hochberg corrected P value of less than 0.05 within the R group cou￾pled with a corrected P value of greater than 0.10 in the NR group was considered statistically significant.
Array miR measurements. The raw CEL files were analyzed with the miR QC Tool software for qual￾ity control (www.affymetrix.com/products_services/arrays/specific/mi_rna.affx#1_4). The expression 
values were summarized and normalized respectively with robust multiple-array average (RMA) (44).

CLINICAL MEDICINE
After normalization, the human-specific miRs were selected for further analysis. The normalized dataset 
contained the expression for 843 miRs at 3 time points (baseline, 3, and 12 months). The data first were 
normalized to baseline for each time point. Two different approaches were used to identify the signifi￾cantly changed miR between R and NR. First, 2-tailed nonparametric statistical Wilcoxon signed-rank
test was used to determine miRs that discriminate between R and NR at 3 and 12 months, with P less 
than 0.05 uncorrected for multiplicity taken for statistical significance. Second, for each miR fold change 
from baseline, differences between R and NR groups were assessed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and 
the criteria for statistical significance were the same as for RT-PCR data except there was no correction 
of the P value for multiplicity. After the between-responder-groups statistical analysis, classification anal￾ysis between the groups was done using RF (45) by generating 50,000 trees. The results of RF analysis 
were visualized using a multidimensional scaling plot. All the analyses were carried out with R (www.r￾project.org). The RF model predictive accuracy was assessed, and the area under the ROC (AUC) was 
calculated using the pROC package in R (46).
Array mRNA measurements. The Affymetrix Bioconductor package was used to summarize and nor￾malize mRNA expression data. RMA normalization was performed on expression data based on internal 
standard amplification, and probe sets were annotated using the hgu133plus2.db Bioconductor package.
RNV, Responder versus Non-responder analyses. Ejection fraction and ventricular volume data were ana￾lyzed by a Wilcoxon rank-sum or signed-rank test using the R statistical package. Differences between treat￾ment group response rates were assessed by contingency table analysis using Fisher’s exact test.
Predicted functional analysis
mRNA and miR expression at baseline was subtracted from expression at 3 and 12 months, which yields 
fold changes in the log2
 scale data. miRs that significantly and selectively changed from baseline or between 
R and NR at 3 and 12 months as determined by RT-PCR, and the top 7 miRs as predicted by RF analysis of 
array data were selected for IPA. Predicted miR targets were determined using Target Scan. All predicted 
targets for a given miR were compared with the mRNA array dataset based on directionality of expression. 
mRNAs that were predicted miR targets and were selectively changed in R versus NR as determined by 
array were further analyzed by IPA.
Human studies approval
All human studies were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. All study partici￾pants signed written informed consent for protocols approved by the IRBs of the University of Colorado 
Anschutz Medical Campus or the University of Utah. The BORG entire cohort study is described in 
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01798992).
