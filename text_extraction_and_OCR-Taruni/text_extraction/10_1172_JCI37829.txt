kidney injury in cell culture and rodent models

The mechanism of mitochondrial damage, a key contributor to renal tubular cell death during acute kidney
injury, remains largely unknown. Here, we have demonstrated a striking morphological change of mito￾chondria in experimental models of renal ischemia/reperfusion and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. This
change contributed to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, release of apoptogenic factors,
and consequent apoptosis. Following either ATP depletion or cisplatin treatment of rat renal tubular cells,
mitochondrial fragmentation was observed prior to cytochrome c release and apoptosis. This mitochondrial
fragmentation was inhibited by Bcl2 but not by caspase inhibitors. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a
critical mitochondrial fission protein, translocated to mitochondria early during tubular cell injury, and
both siRNA knockdown of Drp1 and expression of a dominant-negative Drp1 attenuated mitochondrial
fragmentation, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Further in vivo analysis revealed
that mitochondrial fragmentation also occurred in proximal tubular cells in mice during renal ischemia/
reperfusion and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Notably, both tubular cell apoptosis and acute kidney
injury were attenuated by mdivi-1, a newly identified pharmacological inhibitor of Drp1. This study dem￾onstrates a rapid regulation of mitochondrial dynamics during acute kidney injury and identifies mitochon￾drial fragmentation as what we believe to be a novel mechanism contributing to mitochondrial damage and
apoptosis in vivo in mouse models of disease.
Introduction
Sublethal and lethal injury to renal tubular cells is a major intrin￾sic cause of acute renal failure, a disease associated with high
mortality and increasing prevalence (1–9). In this condition, mito￾chondrial damage has been recognized as a crucial contributor to
tubular cell death in both necrosis and apoptosis (1, 3, 10–14).
Tubular cell necrosis may involve disruption of respiration com￾plexes, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochon￾drial permeability transition, while apoptosis is precipitated by
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and consequent
release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c. Recent in
vivo studies have shown that ablation of proapoptotic Bcl2 family
genes,such as Bid and Bax, leadsto preservation of mitochondrial
integrity, suppression of tubular cell apoptosis, and amelioration
of ischemic and cisplatin nephrotoxic renal failure (15, 16). Nota￾bly, in humans, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and
release of cytochrome c seem to be key to tubular cell apoptosis
in ischemically injured kidneys (17). Despite these findings, the
mechanism underlying mitochondrial damage during tubular
cell apoptosis remains elusive.
A new development in the understanding of mitochondrial
regulation in apoptosis is the discovery of a drastic morphologi￾cal change of the organelles (18, 19). Mitochondria are dynamic
organelles that maintain their shape or morphology via 2 oppos￾ing processes, fission and fusion (20–22). Mitochondrial fission
involves the constriction and cleavage of mitochondria by fission
proteins, such as dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and Fission 1
(Fis1). Mitochondrial fusion, on the other hand, is the lengthen￾ing of mitochondria by tethering and joining together 2 adjacent
mitochondria. Mitofusin-1 and -2 are mainly responsible for outer
membrane fusion, while Opa1 is thought to mediate inner mem￾brane fusion (20–22). Under physiological conditions, mitochon￾dria are elongated and filamentous. Upon stress or apoptotic stim￾ulation, mitochondria become fragmented and, importantly, the
fragmentation may contribute to mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization and the release of apoptogenic factors from the
mitochondrial intermembrane space. Thusfar, mitochondrial frag￾mentation has been demonstrated in a variety of mammalian cells
and also during programmed cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans
and Drosophila (18, 19). A role for mitochondrial fragmentation in
apoptosis has been suggested by notable studies but has also been
seriously challenged recently by others(23–25). Critically, evidence
forthe occurrence of mitochondrial fragmentation and itsinvolve￾ment in relevant pathological or disease conditions is scarce (26).
In the currentstudy, we have demonstrated compelling evidence
for mitochondrial fragmentation in acute kidney injury using in
vitro and in vivo experimental models. The fragmentation involves
the activation of mitochondrial fission via Drp1. Importantly, in
both cell cultures and whole animals, suppression of Drp1 and
mitochondrial fragmentation abrogates mitochondrial damage,
cytochrome c release, apoptosis, and renal injury. Regulation of
mitochondrial dynamics may offer a novelstrategy for the preven￾tion and treatment of acute renal failure.
Results
Mitochondrial fragmentation occurs in response to apoptotic stress in rat prox￾imal tubular cells. Renal ischemia and nephrotoxicity are the major
causes of acute kidney injury. To examine mitochondrial morpho￾Authorship note: Craig Brooks and Qingqing Wei contributed equally to this work.

logical changes under this condition, we transfected MitoRed into
cultured rat proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) to label mitochondria
with red fluorescence.The cellswere subsequently subjected to azide￾induced ATP depletion to model in vivo ischemia or cisplatin treat￾ment for nephrotoxicity. As shown in Figure 1A, mitochondria in
control cells were filamentous with a tubular or thread-like appear￾ance andwere often interconnected to form a network. During azide
treatment, the mitochondrial network broke down and the mito￾chondriawere fragmented into shortrods orspheres. Mitochondrial
fragmentationwas azide-treatmenttime dependent, concurringwith
apoptosis (Figure 1B). Cisplatin also induced mitochondrial frag￾mentation inRPTCsin a time-dependent manner(Figure 1C).Nota￾bly, mitochondrial fragmentation during cisplatin treatment clearly
preceded apoptosis and, as a result, fragmentation was observed at
4 hours, whereas apoptosis was not detected until 12 hours (Figure
1C). A time-lapse study further recorded mitochondrial fragmenta￾tion during azide-induced cell injury. A very rapid/sudden fragmen￾tation of all mitochondria in individual cellswasshown after about 2
hours of azide treatment(SupplementalVideo 1;supplementalmate￾rial available onlinewith this article; doi:10.1172/JCI37829DS1).The
results demonstrate an early and striking morphological change of
mitochondria during tubular cell injury.
Mitochondrial fragmentation can be inhibited by Bcl2 but not by cas￾pase inhibitors. While mitochondrial fragmentation could play a
causative role in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis, it may also
be a result of cell death. We therefore tested the effects of car￾bobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone
(VAD), a pan-caspase inhibitor that blocks apoptosis during ATP
depletion and cisplatin treatment of RPTCs. Although caspase
activation and apoptosis were inhibited (not shown), VAD did
not suppress mitochondrial fragmentation during either azide or
cisplatin treatments (Figure 2, A and B), suggesting that mito￾chondrial fragmentation is not secondary to caspase activation.
We further tested the effects of Bcl2 on mitochondrial fragmenta￾tion during RPTC apoptosis. Asshown in Figure 2, mitochondrial
fragmentation induced by azide and cisplatin was suppressed in
Bcl2-transfected cells. For example, azide treatment induced mito￾chondrial fragmentation in 70% of RPTCs, which was reduced
to 20% in Bcl2-overexpressing RPTCs (Figure 2A). Interestingly,
Bcl2 but not VAD attenuated azide-induced mitochondrial per￾meabilization, reflected by lower cytochrome c release into cyto￾sol (Figure 2C). The results suggest that Bcl2 may protect against
mitochondria injury and apoptosis in part by suppressing mito￾chondrial fragmentation.
Drp1 is activated and translocates to mitochondria early during azide￾induced ATP depletion. The morphology of mitochondria is deter￾mined by 2 opposing processes, fission and fusion (20–22).
Accordingly, mitochondrial fragmentation observed in our study
could be a result of activated fission, suppressed fusion, or both.
We demonstrated the activation of Drp1, a fission protein, during
azide treatment of RPTCs. As shown in Figure 3A, compared with
untreated cells, 1–3 hours of azide treatment induced an accumu￾lation of Drp1 in the mitochondrial fraction. Azide-induced Drp1
translocation was also confirmed by dual immunofluorescence
staining of Drp1 and Fis1, an integral mitochondrial protein
involved in fission (20–22). As shown in Figure 3B, colocaliza￾tion in Drp1 and Fis1 was shown in some azide-treated cells. Of
note, consistent with previous reports (27, 28), Drp1 appeared to
be restricted to specific sites along the mitochondrial membrane,
where fission may have been occurring.
Dominant-negative Drp1 inhibits mitochondrial fragmentation dur￾ing RPTC injury. To determine whether Drp1 is indeed involved in
mitochondrial fragmentation during tubular cell apoptosis, we
tested the effects of dominant-negative Drp1 (DN-Drp1)that had a
K38A point mutation (28). RPTCs were transfected with DN-Drp1
or empty vector and then treated with azide or cisplatin. As shown
in Figure 4A, DN-Drp1 reduced mitochondrialfragmentation from
64%to 28%during azide treatment. Similarly, DN-Drp1 significant￾ly inhibited mitochondrial fragmentation during cisplatin incuba￾tion (Figure 4B). Representative images are shown in Figure 4C.
Untreated cells had typical filamentous mitochondria; after azide
treatment,the mitochondria became fragmented and punctate, but
the cellstransfectedwith DN-Drp1 retained theirfilamentous mito￾chondria. These data suggest a role for Drp1 and associated fission
in mitochondrial fragmentation during tubular cell apoptosis.
Inhibition of cytochrome c release during RPTC injury by DN-Drp1.
Next, we determined whether blocking mitochondrial fragmen￾tation with DN-Drp1 would inhibit cytochrome c release. RPTCs
were cotransfected with MitoRed and DN-Drp1 or empty vector
and then subjected to azide-induced ATP depletion. Cytochrome c

release was examined by immunofluorescence. Of note, the trans￾fection efficacy inRPTCswas 20%–30%. Thus, our examinationwas
focused on the transfected (MitoRed labeled) cells to determine
the effects of DN-Drp1. Representative images are shown in Figure
5A. In control cells, cytochrome c wassequestered in mitochondria
and overlapped with the MitoRed signal. After azide treatment,
mitochondria became fragmented and cytochrome c was released
from mitochondria and distributed throughout the cytosol. How￾ever, DN-Drp1–transfected cells retained filamentous mitochon￾dria and maintained cytochrome c in the organelles. Cell counting
showed that DN-Drp1 significantly inhibited cytochrome crelease
during azide treatment,reducing cytochrome c–released cellsfrom
61% to 26% (Figure 5B). In contrast, DN-Drp1 did not suppress
azide-induced Bax accumulation in mitochondria (Figure 5C). The
resultssuggest that Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation
contributes to mitochondrial damage and cytochrome c release,
although it does not affect initial Bax activation or translocation.
Inhibition of RPTC apoptosis by DN-Drp1.Once released, cytochrome c
activates caspasesto resultin apoptosis(29).By blocking mitochon￾drial fragmentation and cytochrome c release (Figures 4 and 5),
DN-Drp1was expected to inhibit caspase activation and apoptosis.
To testthis, we cotransfected RPTCs with GFP and wild-type Drp1,
DN-Drp1, or empty vector. The cells were then subjected to azide
treatmentfollowed by recovery in normal medium to analyze apop￾tosis and caspase activation. By TUNEL assay, azide induced 51%
apoptosis in vector-transfected cells, which was decreased to 27%
in DN-Drp1–transfected cells(Figure 6A). Consistently, DN-Drp1
suppressed the development of apoptotic morphology in trans￾fected (GFP-labeled) cells, including cellular shrinkage and nucle￾ar fragmentation (Figure 6B). DN-Drp1 also suppressed caspase
activation (not shown). In addition, DN-Drp1 reduced cisplatin￾induced apoptosis from 55% to 32% (Figure 6C).
siRNA knockdown of Drp1 blocks mitochondrial fragmentation, cyto￾chrome c release, and apoptosis. We further confirmed the role of Drp1
in mitochondrial regulation and apoptosis by using an RNA inter￾ference approach. Stable Drp1-siRNA cell lines, including R3 and
R24, were generated by transfection of RPTCs with a specific short
hairpin siRNA of Drp1 (30). Drp1 knockdown in R3 and R24 cells
was verified by immunoblot analysis (Figure 7A). In response to
azide treatment, both R3 and R24 cells showed significantly lower
mitochondrial fragmentation than parental RPTCs (Figure 7B).
Moreover,these cells demonstrated less apoptosis and cytochrome c

release (Figure 7, C and D). Cisplatin-induced mitochondrial frag￾mentation, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis were also sup￾pressed in these cells (data not shown).
Mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis in primary proximal tubu￾lar cells are inhibited by DN-Drp1. To further substantiate the role
of mitochondrial fragmentation in renal injury, we examined
mitochondrial fragmentation during cisplatin treatment of pri￾mary proximal tubular cells. Primary cultures of proximal tubular
cells had highly filamentous mitochondria (Figure 8A). Upon cis￾platin treatment, however, the mitochondria became fragmented
and punctate (Figure 8A). The fragmentation was inhibited by
DN-Drp1 (Figure 8A). Cell counting indicated that DN-Drp1
reduced mitochondrial fragmentation from 55% to 31% (Figure
8B). DN-Drp1 also suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis in
the primary cells (Figure 8C). To determine whether Drp1 sup￾pression affects upstream signaling during cisplatin treatment,
we examined cisplatin-induced p53 phosphorylation and p53-
upregulated modulator of apoptosis α (PUMA-α) induction (31)
in RPTCs stably transfected with Drp1 siRNA. Downregulation
of Drp1 in the siRNA cells was verified above, as shown in Figure
7A. Asshown in Supplemental Figure 1, Drp1 siRNA cellsshowed
p53 and PUMA-α induction similar to that of the parental wild￾type RPTCs, suggesting that Drp1 suppression does not affect
upstream signaling during cisplatin treatment. Together, these
data strongly support a role for Drp1-mediated mitochondrial
fragmentation in tubular cell apoptosis.
Mitochondrial fragmentation occurs in vivo in proximal tubular cells 
following renal ischemia. To examine mitochondrial fragmentation
in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 30 minutes of bilateral
clamping to induce renal ischemia followed by brief (15 minutes)
reperfusion. Kidneys were collected for EM. EM micrographs of
proximal tubular cells from both cortex and outer stripe of outer
medulla were selected for evaluation. Due to the orientation of
mitochondria, proximal tubular cells from control animals usu￾ally displayed 10%–20% long (≥ 2 μm) filamentous mitochondria
at the basal lateral side, whereas the perinuclear mitochondria
were cross-sectioned and thus appeared “fragmented” (Figure 9A).
After ischemia/reperfusion, however, many proximal tubular cells
completely fragmented their mitochondria into small, punctate
suborganelles (Figure 9A). For quantification, we determined the
percentage of cells that had completely lost their long mitochon￾dria. As shown in Figure 9B, sham control had approximately 7%
proximal tubular cells with fragmented mitochondria, which was
increased to 42% during renal ischemia/reperfusion.
To confirm mitochondrial fragmentation in ischemically
injured tubular cells, we performed 3D reconstruction of mito￾chondria from 100 serial section EM micrographs. The control
tubular cell showed many filamentous mitochondria at the baso￾lateral side in 2D EM (not shown); in the reconstruction, we pur￾posely selected a perinuclear area where mitochondria appeared
“fragmented” (Figure 10A). The 3D image showed clearly that
these mitochondria were actually long and filamentous (Figure
10B). In sharp contrast, mitochondria in the ischemic cells were
completely fragmented (Figure 10, C and D). These data indicate
that mitochondrial fragmentation indeed occurs in vivo in renal
tubular cells during ischemic injury.

and colleagues have recently screened several chemical libraries and
identified mdivi-1 as an efficacious inhibitor of mitochondrial divi￾sion that operates by selectively inhibiting Drp1 (32). To determine
the role of Drp1 and mitochondrialfragmentation in vivo,we exam￾ined the effects of mdivi-1 in the mouse model of ischemia/reperfu￾sion (Figure 11). Ischemia/reperfusion induced a rapid loss of renal

function, as indicated by increases in serum creatinine and blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) (Figure 11, A and B), which was partially but
significantly reduced in animals pretreated with mdivi-1 (Figure 11,
A and B).Consistently, mdivi-1 ameliorated tubular damage in renal
cortical and outer medulla tissues, as determined by histological
examination (Figure 11, C and D). We further analyzed renal apop￾tosis by TUNEL assay. Cell counting showed that ischemia/reperfu￾sion induced 24 apoptotic cells/mm2 renal tissue in mice that were
pretreated with vehicle solution but only 11 in mdivi-1–pretreated
mice (Figure 11E). Using EM, we confirmed that mdivi-1 partially
suppressed ischemia-induced mitochondrialfragmentation in proxi￾mal tubular cells, from 43% to 32%.
We further analyzed mitochondrial fragmentation in a mouse
of cisplatin nephrotoxicity (15, 33). It was shown that cispla￾tin (30 mg/kg) treatment for 3 and 4 days led to mitochondrial
fragmentation in 33% and 53% of proximal tubular cells, respec￾tively. We then determined the effects of mdivi-1 on cisplatin￾induced renal injury and nephrotoxicity. As shown in Supple￾mental Figure 2, both BUN and serum creatinine increases
during cisplatin treatment were reduced by daily mdivi-1 injec￾tions. Consistently, mdivi-1 ameliorated renal tissue damage,
especially in renal tubules. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis was also
decreased by mdivi-1 (Supplemental Figure 2). Collectively, the
results support an important role for Drp1-mediated mitochon￾drial fragmentation in the pathogenesis of both ischemic and
nephrotoxic acute kidney injury.
Discussion
Tubular cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway contributes
to ischemic as well as nephrotoxic acute kidney injury (1, 3, 4, 6,
10, 11, 13, 14). The inference has been supported not only by in
vitro cell culture and in vivo animal studies but also by biopsy of
ischemically injured human kidneys (17). In this condition, Bax
and Bak are activated and form oligomers on mitochondria, lead￾ing to permeabilization of the outer membrane and release of
apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c. Despite these findings,
it is not entirely clear how the outer membrane of mitochondria
is permeabilized. In this study, we have revealed a striking mor￾phological change of mitochondria in both in vitro and in vivo
experimental models of acute kidney injury. Mitochondria become
fragmented early during renal cell injury. Importantly, prevention
of mitochondrial fragmentation by use of genetic and pharmaco￾logical approaches abrogates mitochondrial damage, tubular cell
apoptosis, and renal injury.

A role for mitochondrial fragmentation in apoptosis has been
suggested and supported by notable studies (18); however, it has
also been seriously challenged by others (24, 34). For example, the
latest work by Sheridan et al. showed that Bcl-xL and Mcl1, 2 anti￾apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins, can antagonize cytochrome crelease
without blocking mitochondrial fragmentation in HeLa cells, sug￾gesting a separation of the morphological change from mitochon￾drial damage (25). Breckenridge et al. further demonstrated that
regulation of mitochondrial morphological dynamics does not
have a significant role in the regulation of programmed cell death
in C. elegans (23), disputing the previous finding by Jagasia et al.
(35). The contrasting results may certainly be caused by differences
in the experimental conditions or models. While the controversy
may not be solved easily, a critical question is whether mitochon￾drial fragmentation occurs in vivo under disease conditions and
how much it contributesto pathological apoptosis. Unfortunately,
examination of mitochondrial fragmentation in vivo in mamma￾lian tissues is not a trivial task. Thus far, the only reported exami￾nation isfrom Barsoum et al., who showed that mitochondria were
fragmented in neuronsin ischemically injured brain (26). However,
whether the fragmentation is important to neuronal apoptosis in
the brainwas not determined. Our currentstudy has demonstrated
convincing evidence for mitochondrial fragmentation in kidneys
following ischemia/reperfusion by using 2D and 3D EM. Impor￾tantly, we have further shown that pharmacological blockade of
mitochondrial fission can attenuate tubular cell apoptosis, tissue
damage, and renal injury, demonstratingwhatwe believe isthe first
in vivo evidence for a role of the regulation of mitochondrial mor￾phological dynamics in pathological apoptosis in disease models.
Of note, in many tissue types, mitochondria are randomly ori￾ented and, as a result, tissue sectioning for EM results in cross
sections of most mitochondria within a cell. These mitochondria
would then appear to be small and round, difficult to distinguish
from fragmented mitochondria in 2D EM. In this regard, tubular
cells in the kidneys make an excellent model for studying mito￾chondrial fragmentation in vivo because in these cells a significant
portion of mitochondria line up perpendicular to the basement
membrane and, as a result, cross sections of tubules would nor￾mally reveal 10%–20% longitudinally sectioned long mitochondria
in a given cell. In contrast, when mitochondria are fragmented,
they appear as short rods or spherical fragments, no matter how
they are sectioned. The unique feature of mitochondrial organiza￾tion in renal tubular cells not only makes it easier to count and
quantify mitochondria-fragmented cells but also ensures the reli￾ability of the results. In this study, we have further verified the 2D
EM results by 3D reconstruction of serial section EM images.
The morphology of mitochondria is determined by a balance
between fission and fusion (20–22). Thus, fragmentation of the
organelles can be a result of increased fission, suppressed fusion,
or a combination of both. In this study, during renal tubular cell
injury, we detected an early activation and mitochondrial translo￾cation of Drp1, a critical fission protein. Moreover, suppression
of Drp1 by dominant-negative mutants, siRNA, or mdivi-1 can
block mitochondrial fragmentation. These results, though not
excluding a role for mitochondrial fusion regulation, suggest that
mitochondrial fission is activated under experimental conditions
and contributes to the observed mitochondrial fragmentation. It
is unclear how Drp1 is activated. Posttranslational modification of
Drp1 including phosphorylation and sumoylation has been docu￾mented and may play a role in Drp1 activation upon apoptotic
stress (36, 37). Further investigations should examine these pos￾sibilities during renal cell injury. In addition, Drp1 is also involved
in the fission of peroxisomes(38, 39). Whether and to what extent
Drp1-related changesin peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial
damage and apoptosis has yet to be determined.
It is currently unclear how mitochondrial fragmentation, a seem￾ingly morphological change, can have an impact on mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization (18, 19).Itis clearfrom previousstudies

to trigger porous defectsin the outer membrane (18, 19).In support,
our recent work showed that although all apoptotic cells have frag￾mented mitochondria, not all mitochondria-fragmented cells have
cytochrome crelease or apoptosis(40). We furthershowed that frag￾mented mitochondria can re-fuse if the injurious stress is removed
before permanent damage occurs to trigger apoptosis (our unpub￾lished observations). However, when the injury is prolonged, mito￾chondria cannot re-fuse and become irreversibly damaged. These
observations suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation is not the
“point of no return”; rather, it is a facilitating event for irreversible
damage. It is likely that fragmentation sensitizes mitochondria to
additional injurious events,which precipitate in the membrane leak￾age. One such event, as proposed in ourrecent work (40), isinitiated
and mediated by Bax and Bak. Mitochondrial fragmentation is vir￾tually a process of membrane bending,scission, and remelding. The
associated biochemical and biophysical changes of the membrane
are expected to significantly affect the interaction, activation, and
function ofthe moleculesresiding in or accumulating nearthe mem￾brane.Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization involvesthe
activation of Bax and Bak and significant conformational changes
of the proteins (41–45). Thus, fragmentation may predispose the
mitochondria to Bax/Bak-induced development of porous defects.
This scenario, also called the “2-hit” hypothesis (46), emphasizes 2
critical events of outer membrane permeabilization: mitochondrial
fragmentation and Bax/Bak-mediated pore formation.Itis notewor￾thy that these 2 events are not separately regulated, as both may be
subjected to regulation by Bcl2 family proteins(18, 46).
Our present results show that temporary block￾ade of fission can prevent mitochondrial fragmen￾tation and tubular cell apoptosis during acute kid￾ney injury. However, it is important to note that
permanent blockade of mitochondrial fission
may adversely affect mitochondrial, cellular, and
renal function or physiology. In this regard, Chan
and colleagues showed that mitochondrial frag￾mentation due to loss of fusion proteins leads to
defects in mitochondrial respiration and oxygen
consumption accompanied by loss of mitochon￾drial membrane potential and cell growth inhibi￾tion (47). Interestingly, Rossignol and colleagues
demonstrated that forced fusion of mitochondria
by Drp1 knockdown also results in a reduction in
respiration and oxygen consumption (48). These
results, seemingly contradictory, suggest that
mitochondrial morphological dynamics is a key
to mitochondrial physiology and perturbation of
the dynamics to either fission or fusion direction
would reduce mitochondrial function.
In conclusion,thisstudy has demonstrated mito￾chondrial fragmentation in both ischemic and
nephrotoxic models of acute renal failure. Mito￾chondrial fragmentation occurs early and contrib￾utes to subsequent development of mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization,release of apoptogen￾ic factors, and tubular cell apoptosis. Importantly,
inhibition of mitochondrialfragmentation protects
againsttubular cell apoptosis and renal injury,sug￾gesting what we believe is a novel strategy for the
prevention and treatment of acute renal failure.
Methods
Antibodies, plasmids, and other reagents. Antibodies and sources are as follows:
monoclonal anti–cytochrome c(7H8.2C12 and 6H2.B4), anti-active caspase￾3, and anti-Drp1 from BD Biosciences — Pharmingen; polyclonal anti-Fis1
from ALEXIS Biochemicals; polyclonal anti–phospho-p53 from Cell Signal￾ing Technology; monoclonal anti-Bax from NeoMarkers; polyclonal anti￾PUMA from Jian Yu (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
USA); and allsecondary antibodiesfrom Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora￾toriesInc. Plasmids containing Drp1 orits dominant-negative mutant were
kindly provided by Alexander van der Bliek (UCLA School of Medicine, Los
Angeles, California, USA) (28) and were further subcloned into pcDNA3.1
(Invitrogen)forthisstudy. The short hairpin Drp1 siRNA plasmidwas a gift
from Ansgar Santel (Silence Therapeutics, Berlin, Germany) (30). pDsRed2-
Mito (MitoRed), an expression vector encoding red fluorescent proteinwith
a mitochondrialtargeting sequence,was purchased from Clontech.All other
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted.
RPTC lines. RPTCs were originally provided by Ulrich Hopfer (Case West￾ern Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA). RPTC linesstably transfect￾ed with Bcl2 were generated in previous work (49). RPTC lines with Drp1
knockdown were generated by transfection with the short hairpin Drp1
siRNA plasmid (30),followed by hygromycin selection. In brief, RPTCswere
cotransfected with the Drp1 siRNA plasmid and a hygromycin resistance
vector. 24 hours aftertransfection, cells were treated with 400 μg/ml hygro￾mycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Hygromycin treatment was continued until the
original monolayer of cells wasreduced to individual cells. The hygromycin
concentration was then reduced to 200 μg/ml to allow the individual cells
to proliferate into colonies.Individual colonieswere extracted and cultured,

then tested for Drp1 expression. All RPTCs were maintained in Ham’s
F-12/DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml
insulin, 1 ng/ml EGF, 4 μg/ml dexamethasone, and 1% antibiotics.
Primary renal proximal tubular cells. C57BL/6 mice (8 to 12 weeks, male)
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Renal cortical tissues were
harvested from animalsto isolate proximal tubular cellsfor culture as pre￾viously described (15, 33). In brief, cortical tissues were minced, digested
with collagenase, and centrifuged in 32% Percoll medium to purify prox￾imal tubular cells. Cells were then plated in collagen-coated dishes and
maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml transfer￾rin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.05 μM hydrocortisone, and 50 μM vitamin C.
Apoptotic treatment. For ATP depletion, cells were treated with 10 mM
azide in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution for 3 hours ortime
as indicated (50). After the incubation, cells were fractionated for analysis
of cytochrome c release, fixed for immunostaining and microscopic exam￾ination, or returned to glucose-containing culture medium for 2 hours
to observe apoptosis (51, 52). For cisplatin treatment, RPTC lines were
incubated with 20 μM cisplatin in culture medium for 4 to 16 hours (53),
whereas primary mouse kidney tubular cells were
incubated with 50 μM cisplatin for 20 hours (15).
Transfection. RPTCs were plated at approximately
50% confluence and transfected with 1.0 μg plas￾mid DNA using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent
(Invitrogen). Primary cultures of isolated kidney
tubular cells were plated at approximately 70%
confluence for transfection with 1.0 μg plasmid
DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). To visual￾ize mitochondria, cells were transfected with 0.1 μg
pDsRed2-Mito to label mitochondria with the red
fluorescent MitoRed protein.
Mitochondrial and cell morphology. Mitochon￾drial morphology was examined by fluorescence
microscopy in pDsRed2-Mito–transfected cells
as described in our recent study (40). pDsRed2-
Mito transfection leads to the expression in mito￾chondria of the red fluorescent protein MitoRed,
a fusion protein containing a red fluorescent
sequence and a mitochondrial targeting domain
of cytochrome c oxidase, subunit VIII. MitoRed
signal is not sensitive to changes of mitochondrial
conditions including membrane potential and redox status. In brief, cells
were transfected with pDsRed2-Mito. After various treatments, the cells
were examined by fluorescence microscopy to evaluate mitochondrial
morphology in individual cells. Mitochondria of untreated cells were fila￾mentous and showed a threadlike tubular structure, while mitochondria
in stressed cells were fragmented and appeared shortened and punctate.
Consistent with earlier studies (15, 54, 55), the mitochondria within a
cell were often either filamentous or fragmented. In uncommon cases of
mixed mitochondrial morphology, we classified the cells based on the
majority (>70%) of mitochondria. Cytochrome c release and apoptotic
morphology were often evaluated in the same cells that were assessed for
mitochondrial morphology. Cytochrome c release was indicated by the
loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c staining and the appearance of cyto￾chrome c in cytosol. Typical apoptotic morphology was indicated by cel￾lular condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies, and condensation and
fragmentation of the nucleus. For each sample, several random fields of
cells (≥100 cells per dish) were evaluated for mitochondrial morphology,
apoptosis, and cytochrome c release.

Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining. Cells were grown on colla￾gen-coated glass coverslips and subjected to various treatments. The
cells were then fixed with a modified Zamboni’s fixative containing 4%
paraformaldehyde and picric acid and permeabilized with 0.1% SDS.
Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 2% BSA. After block￾ing, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (monoclonal mouse
anti–cytochrome c, anti-Drp1, anti-Fis1, or anti-active caspase-3) and
secondary antibodies (Cy-3–labeled or FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse
IgG). TUNEL staining was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detec￾tion Kit from Roche Applied Science according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In brief, cells were grown on collagen-coated glass cov￾erslips for experiment, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and per￾meabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. Cells were
then incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 hour at 37°C.
Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining were examined by fluores￾cence and confocal microscopy, using a LSM 510 Zeiss microscope.
Cellular fractionation. To study cytochrome c release, cells were incubat￾ed with 0.05% digitonin in an isotonic sucrose buffer (250 mM sucrose,
10 mM HEPES-NaOH, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; pH 7.2) at room
temperature as described previously (40, 49). At this concentration,
digitonin selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane but not the
mitochondrial membrane. The digitonin extract was collected as the
cytosolic fraction for immunoblot analysis. To examine Drp1 transloca￾tion to mitochondria during apoptosis, cells were collected in ice-cold
isotonic sucrose buffer by gentle scraping. The cells were then homoge￾nized with a Wheaton homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at
1000 g to remove debris and nuclei to collect the supernatant for further

centrifugation at 10,000 g to yield the mitochondrial fraction. Homog￾enization and centrifugation procedures were conducted at 4°C.
Immunoblot analysis. Standard procedure was performed forimmunoblot￾ting using NuPAGE (Invitrogen) or Bio-Rad Gel Systems. In brief, 25 μg
protein from each sample wasresolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under
reducing conditions. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes
and blocked using 5% milk. The membranes were then incubated with pri￾mary antibody overnight at 4°C and with HRP-conjugated secondary anti￾bodiesfor 1 hour atroom temperature. The antigen-specific signalwasthen
detected through incubation with enhanced chemoluminescence substrate
(Pierce Biotechnology).
Renal ischemia/reperfusion in C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice purchased from
The Jackson Laboratory were maintained in the animal facility of Charlie
Norwood VA Medical Center at Augusta under a 12-hour light/12-hour
dark cycle with free access to food and water. Renal ischemia was induced
in male mice of 8 to 10 weeks as described previously (15, 16, 33). In brief,
the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (i.p., 50 mg/kg) and were
kept on a homeothermic table. Flank incisions were made to expose the
renal pedicles for bilateral clamping to induce 30 minutes of renal isch￾emia. The clamps were then released for reperfusion for indicated times.
Control animals were subjected to sham operation without renal pedicle
clamping. To test the effects of mdivi-1, the animals were injected (i.p.)
with 50 mg/kg body weight mdivi-1 1 hour prior to renal ischemia/reper￾fusion. All experiments involving animals were conducted according to a
protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
of Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center.
Renal function, histology, and TUNEL assay. Serum creatinine and BUN
were determined to monitor renal function as previously reported (15, 16,
33). For histology, kidneys were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin
embedded, and stained with H&E. Histopathological changes evaluated
in this study included loss of brush border, tubular dilation, cast forma￾tion, and cell lysis. Tissue damage was examined in a blind manner and
scored according to the percentage of damaged tubules: 0, no damage; 1,
less than 25% damage; 2, 25%–50% damage; 3, 50%–75% damage; and 4,
more than 75% damage. TUNEL assay was performed to evaluate apopto￾sis in renal tissues using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit from Roche
Applied Science as described previously (15, 16, 33). In brief, renal tissues
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded. Tissue sec￾tions of 4 μm were exposed to a TUNEL reaction mixture containing ter￾minal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and nucleotides, including tetrameth￾ylrhodamine–labeled (TMR-labeled) dUTP. The slides were examined by
fluorescence microscopy.
Examination of mitochondrial fragmentation in renal tissues by 2D EM. Sham￾operated control and ischemia/reperfused animalswere perfusedwith 10 ml
(at 10 units/ml) heparin, followed by 50 ml fixative containing 100 mM
sodium cacodylate, 2 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgSO4, 4% paraformaldehyde,
and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Kidneys were then harvested and postfixed in
the same fixative. A tissue block of approximately 1 mm3 was collected
from each kidney, including a portion of renal cortex and outer medulla
for standard processing for EM. The tissue block was examined initially
at low magnification (×3,000) to identify representative proximal tubules.
Cellsin these tubules were then examined at high magnification (×15,000)
to reveal mitochondria. To determine mitochondrial fragmentation, digi￾tal images with scale bars were collected in EM. The lengths of individual
mitochondria in a cellwere measured by tracing using NIH ImageJsoftware
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). For each cell, approximately 100 mitochondria
in a representative area were measured to determine the percentage distri￾bution of mitochondria with variouslengths(0–1 μm, 1–2 μm, >2 μm). We
showed that the mitochondrial diameter of tubular cells is approximately
0.3 to 0.5 μm and that a mitochondrion with length greater than 2 μm is
clearly filamentous(Figure 9). In 2D EM, proximal tubular cellsin control
tissues consistently showed 10%–20% long filamentous mitochondria. If a
cell had undergone mitochondrial fragmentation, then very few or no fila￾mentous mitochondria would appear. Thus, we determined the percentage
of cells that had less than 1% long filamentous mitochondria to indicate
the degree of mitochondrial fragmentation.
Examination of mitochondria in renal tissues by 3D EM. Renal tissues were
fixed and processed for EM as described above. The tissues were initially
examined to identify representative proximal tubules for serial section.
One hundred serialsections(45 nm/section) were collected from represen￾tative tubules or cells. EM images of the serial sections were obtained and
then aligned to reconstruct a 3D image of mitochondria using Reconstruct
Software, version 1.1.0.0 (http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/tools/recon￾struct/reconstruct.stm).
Statistics. Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± SD from at least 3
separate experiments. Statistical differences between the means were deter￾mined using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post test. P < 0.05 was considered
significant. Qualitative data including cell images and immunoblots are
representative of at least 3 separate experiments.
