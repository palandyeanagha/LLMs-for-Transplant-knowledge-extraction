A B S T R A C T To determine vasopressin (VP)-poten￾tiating effect of chlorpropamide (CPMD), we studied
the effect of CPMD in vivo and in vitro in kidneys and
in specific tubule segments of rats with hypothalamic
diabetes insipidus, homozygotes of the Brattleboro
strain (DI rats). Rats on ad lib. water intake were
treated with CPMD (20 mg/100 g body wt s.c. daily)
for 7 d. While on ad lib. water intake, the urine flow,
urine osmolality, urinary excretion of Na+, K+, cre￾atinine, or total solute excretion did not change. How￾ever, corticopapillary gradient of solutes was signifi￾cantly increased in CPMD-treated rats. Higher tissue
osmolality was due to significantly increased concen￾tration of Na+, and to a lesser degree urea, in the
medulla and papilla of CPMD-treated rats. Conse￾quently, the osmotic gradient between urine and pap￾illary tissue of CPMD-treated rats (A = 385±47 mosM)
was significantly (P < 0.001) higher compared with
controls (A = 150±26 mosM). Minimum urine osmo￾lality after water loading was higher in CPMD-treated
DI rats than in controls. Oxidation of ['4C]lactate to
14CO2 coupled to NaCl cotransport was measured in
thick medullary ascending limb of Henle's loop (MAL)
microdissected from control and CPMD-treated rats.
These studies were presented, in part, at the Central So￾ciety for Clinical Research Meeting, November 1982, Chi￾cago, IL (1982. Clin. Res. 30:786a. [Abstr.]) and 15th Annual

The rate of 14CO2 production was higher (A + 113%±20;
P < 0.01) in CPMD-treated MAL compared with con￾trols, but 14CO2 production in the presence of 10-' M
furosemide did not differ between MAL from control
and from CPMD-treated rats. These observations sug￾gest that CPMD treatment enhances NaCl transport
in MAL. Cyclic AMP metabolism was analyzed in
microdissected MAL and in medullary collecting tu￾bule (MCT). MCT from control and from CPMD￾treated rats did not differ in the basal or VP-stimulated
accumulated of cAMP. The increase in cAMP content
elicited by 10-6 M VP in MAL from CPMD-treated
rats (A + 12.0±1.8 fmol cAMP/mm) was significantly
(P < 0.02) higher compared with MAL from control
rats (A + 5.1±1.0 fmol cAMP/mm). Preincubation of
MAL dissected from Sprague-Dawley rats with 10-4
M CPMD in vitro increased cAMP accumulation in
the presence of VP, but no such enhancement was
found in preincubated MCT. Adenylate cyclase
activity, basal or stimulated by VP, 5'guanyl￾imidodiphosphate, or by NaF, assayed in isotonic me￾dium did not differ between MAL or MCT from con￾trol rats and MAL or MCT from CPMD-treated rats.
When assayed in hypertonic medium (800 mosM), the
adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of 10-6 M VP
was significantly higher in MAL of CPMD-treated rats.
MAL and MCT from control and CPMD-treated rats
did not differ in the activities of cAMP phosphodies￾terase. The rate of [14C]arachidonic acid conversion to
[14C]prostaglandin E2 by medullary and papillary mi￾crosomes was not different between the control and
CPMD-treated rats; likewise, there was no difference
in accumulation of immunoreactive prostaglandin E2
in the medium of in vitro incubated medullary or pap￾illary slices prepared from control and CPMD-treated
rats.

Based on the findings recounted above, we propose
a hypothesis that CPMD administration enhances the
antidiuretic effect of VP, primarily by increasing med￾ullary and papillary tonicity due to increased NaCl
reabsorption in MAL. There is no evidence that CPMD
sensitizes collecting tubules to the action of VP, at least
at the cAMP-generation step. Therefore, increased
antidiuretic response to VP in the kidneys of CPMD￾treated DI rats is due to enhanced osmotic driving
force for water reabsorption (lumen-to-interstitium
osmotic gradient) in collecting tubules, rather than due
to increased VP-dependent water permeability of tu￾bular epithelium.
INTRODUCTION
The administration of chlorpropamide (CPMD) is well
known to produce antidiuresis or to potentiate anti￾diuretic effect of vasopressin (VP) hypothalamic-neu￾rohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI) (1-9). Earlier
observations suggested that CPMD-induced antidi￾uresis is due in part to stimulation of VP release (1),
but some other studies (2, 10, 11) did not find evidence
for such an effect. Unquestionably, the major action
of CPMD is enhancement of antidiuretic response of
the kidney to endogenous or to exogenous VP (1-9).
Based on studies of amphibian urinary bladder and on
various preparations of renal medulla, several hy￾potheses were proposed attempting to explain VP-po￾tentiating effect of CPMD. The central tenet of these
hypotheses is the proposition that CPMD increases the
sensitivity of target epithelium to VP. Since cyclic
(c)AMP mediates transport effects of VP (12, 13), it
was proposed (5, 14-16), as reviewed recently (8, 13),
that CPMD increases cAMP accumulation in epithelial
cells in response to VP.
First, it was proposed that CPMD-elicited enhance￾mnent of cAMP accumulation is due to inhibition of
renal cAMP phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDIE) (13, 15-
17), or due to increased stimulation of renal medullary
adenylate cyclase (AdC) by VP (5, 14, 18). Also, studies
of CPMD action on amphibian urinary bladder could
be interpreted as potentiation of VP effect at cAMP
generation step (19-22). However, Omachi et al. (23)
found that CPMD lowers the cAMP content of toad
urinary bladder in response to VP.
Prostaglandins (PG), modulators of VP action (12,
13), were implicated in VP-potentiating effects of
CPMD. Ozer and Sharp (19) proposed that CPMD
decreases the inhibitory effect of PGE on VP-depen￾dent generation of cAMP. A more recent study (24)
suggested that inhibition of intraepithelial synthesis of
PGE2 at the PG cyclo-oxygenase step by CPMD and
other sulfonylureas relieves a negative modulatory ef￾fect of PGE on hydroosmotic response to VP (24).
Several considerations motivated us to investigate
further the CPMD action on renal tubules. First, it has
been difficult to explain why not only CPMD but also
some other sulfonylurea antidiabetic drugs, namely
glyburide, which do not have VP-enhancing properties
in mammalian kidney in vivo (8, 25-27), also inhibited
the PGE2 synthesis and enhanced VP-induced water
flow in the amphibian bladder system in vitro in a way
similar to CPMD (8, 24). Also, it appears puzzling that
treatment of rats with CPMD either does not diminish
(28), but even enhances (18) urinary excretion of PG
in response to large doses of VP, or to its analogue [1-
deamino,8-D-arginine]-vasopressin (DDAVP). All
studies published to date investigated CPMD effect on
renal cAMP metabolism in whole medullary and/or
papillary preparations (5, 13-16, 18). It is only recent
knowledge that these gross anatomical zones of the
kidney contain at least two types of epithelia with VP￾sensitive cAMP metabolism, namely ascending limb
of Henle's loop, and epithelium of collecting tubules
(12, 29-31). It is, therefore, uncertain in which one of
these two tubule segments (or on both) CPMD may
influence cAMP metabolism in response to VP. Finally,
unexplored remained the question whether CPMD
may act not only by changing VP-regulated water
permeability of collecting tubules, but whether it also
may have an effect on another fundamentally impor￾tant factor for mammalian antidiuretic response-a
corticopapillary gradient of solutes (32).
The results of our present study indicate that ad￾ministration of CPMD to DI rats has no effect on VP￾dependent cAMP accumulation in medullary collect￾ing tubules (MCT), but that it does increase VP-de￾pendent cAMP accumulation in medullary thick as￾cending limb of Henle's loop (MAL). Even more
importantly, treatment with CPMD increases
corticopapillary gradient of solutes, namely of Na+ and
urea, and stimulates NaCl transport-coupled oxidation
of substrate in MAL. Based on these findings, we pro￾pose as a new hypothesis (Fig. 3) that CPMD admin￾istration enhances the antidiuretic effect of VP in renal
medulla of DI rats primarily by increasing the osmotic
driving force for water reabsorption in collecting tu￾bules (Fig. 3).

METHODS
Animals. Most experiments were conducted on the adult
male homozygotes of Brattleboro strain of rats (weighing
200-300 g) with hereditary DI (further referred to as "DI
rats") purchased from Blue Spruce Farms, Altamont, NY.
Some studies were conducted on male adult Sprague-Dawley
albino rats purchased from Bio-Lab, Inc., Minneapolis, MN.
All animals were maintained in an air-conditioned room
(21°-25°C) and allowed free access to tap water and stan￾dard diet (Purina laboratory rat chow, Ralston Purina Co.,
St. Louis, MO).
Experimental design. DI rats were housed in individual
metabolic cages with free access to food and water ad lib.
Urine was collected daily under oil. Experimental DI rats
were treated for 7 d with CPMD in one daily subcutaneous
injection in a dose 20 mg/100 g body wt; control DI rats
received the same volume of vehicle (3, 5, 14, 18). CPMD
for injection was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl slightly alkalinized
with concentrated NaOH and then adjusted to pH 7.4 with
HCI (3, 5, 18) to a final concentration 50 mg CPMD/ml. To
ascertain that CPMD was effectively reabsorbed, a sample
of blood for the determination of glucose and other analyses
was obtained from the jugular vein, under light ether anes￾thesia, before and after 7-d treatment with CPMD. As ex￾pected, CPMD treatment resulted in -58% drop in ambient
plasma glucose levels, but no significant change in plasma
glucose was observed in vehicle-treated controls. Rats treated
with CPMD did not show any signs of toxicity. They did not
loose weight and their blood urea nitrogen and plasma cre￾atinine (Cr) levels were in normal range and not different
from controls (data not shown). Also, urine excretion param￾eters did not differ from controls (Table II). 2 h after the
last injection of CPMD (or vehicle) the DI rats were lightly
anesthetized with pentobarbital (6 mg/100 g body wt) and
the kidneys were taken for further analyses, as described
below, and the animals were killed.
The water-loading test was performed in control DI rats
and CPMD-treated DI rats as described by Stoff et al. (33).
After overnight fasting,' the rats were given oral distilled
water load of 5% of body weight, and urine flow and urine
osmolality (UoSm) was determined in 30-min intervals.
As in our previous studies (29, 34, 35), the experiments
were designed in such a way that CPMD-treated and control
animals were handled simultaneously throughout the exper￾iment on a paired basis, i.e., the control and CPMD-treated
rat entered the experimental protocol simultaneously, the
kidneys were removed and fluid and tissue samples as well
as tubules were microdissected at the same time. Likewise,
incubations, storage, and all analyses of samples from control
and CPMD-treated animals were conducted simultaneously
with the use of the same chemicals, radiochemicals, and stan￾dards in order to minimize variability.
Analysis of solutes in tissues and fluids. We used pre￾viously reported procedures (33, 36, 37). The kidneys were
rapidly removed under anesthesia. The cortex, outer (red)
medulla, and papilla were separated by razor blade and rap￾idly frozen by clamping with stainless steel tongs precooled
by immersion in liquid N2. Deep-frozen tissue was trans￾ferred to polyethylene (12 X 75 mm) test tubes filled with
liquid N2 and surrounded by dry ice. The tubes with tissues
in the frozen state were weighed again with a Sartorius
microbalance to determine wet weight. After overnight ly￾ophylization, tubes were reweighed for the determination
of dry weight. Lyophylized tissue was extracted for deter￾mination of solutes using in principle the method of Apple￾boom (36).
Approximately 1 ml of triple-distilled water heated at
100°C was added to each tube and tubes were then heated
in a boiling water bath for 60 min. The test tubes with ex￾tracted tissue samples were cooled and reweighed to deter￾mine the final volume of added water. Samples were then
centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min and aliquots of supernatant
were used for the determination of Na+, K+, and urea. Water
content in samples was expressed as percentage of wet
weight. Total tissue osmolality was calculated as follows (33):
Total osmolality [mosM/kg H20] = [urea] + 2 [Na+] + 2 [K+].
Urinary excretion of solutes (UNV) was measured as in our
previous studies (37-39). Total urinary excretion of sodium
(UNaV), potassium (UKV), total solutes (UosmV), and Cr (Uc,V)
was expressed per 100 g body wt per 24 h. Na+ and K+ was
determined by atomic absorption photometry (model 951,
Instrument Laboratories Corp. Palatine, IL), urea by the
colorimetric method using Harleco kits (39). UOsm was mea￾sured with a Fiske osmometer (Fiske Associates, Inc., Bur￾lington, MA); Cr was determined colorimetrically (40).
Plasma glucose was determined with the hexokinase/glu￾cose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase method (41), as in our pre￾vious report (38).
Microdissection of tubules. Tubular segments were dis￾sected from vehicle-treated controls and from CPMD-treated
DI rats, control, and drug-treated rats always in the same
way, using the procedures described in detail in our previous
studies (29, 34, 35, 42) with several recent minor modifi￾cations. Briefly, under light anesthesia with pentobarbital
(6 mg/100 g body wt) the aorta was cannulated retrogradely
with polyethylene PE-100 tubing (Clay Adams, Div. of Bec￾ton, Dickinson & Co., Parsippany, NJ), the tip being placed
just distal to the branching of the left renal artery. Com￾position of all solutions are described below. The left kidney
was perfused to complete blanching with 5-10 ml of per￾fusion solution, subsequently followed by 20 ml of heparin￾ized (heparin concentration 20 USP U/ml) collagenase me￾dium for -5 min and then sliced with a razor blade along
the corticomedullary axis. The slices were then incubated
in aerated collagenase medium (at 35°C for 45 min) then
thoroughly rinsed in ice-cold microdissection medium and
transferred to petri dishes for microdissection. Microdissec￾tion and all subsequent procedures were performed at 0°-
4°C. Segments of MAL and MCT were carefully teased out
from the inner stripe of the outer medulla with sharpened
steel needles using a stereomicroscope (magnification X 30).
MAL and MCT were identified using the established cri￾teria (31, 42, 43), as in our previous studies (29, 34, 35, 42).
Some differences were observed between MAL and MCT
dissected from DI rats (Brattleboro homozygotes) and the
same segments dissected from Spraque-Dawley rats (42).
MCT can be dissected with greater ease, and vice versa,
MAL with greater difficulty from DI rats, compared with
normal Sprague-Dawley rats (42). For example, using the
same technique, dissected MAL were obtained in shorter
fragments and MCT In longer fragments in Brattleboro DI
rats than in Sprague-Dawley rats. This feature may be re￾1300 E. Kusano, J. L. Braun-Werness, D. J. Vick, M. J. Keller, and T. P. Dousa

lated to different morphology of medulla and medullary in￾terstitium of DI rats reported earlier (44, 45). Dissected seg￾ments were aspirated and transferred onto small round frag￾ments (-3 mm2) of glass coverslip. The total length of
tubules in the sample was then determined. Samples were
placed on the stage of microscope (model 1053, American
Optical Scientific Instruments, Warner-Lambert Co., Buf￾falo, NY) with a drawing attachment (camera lucida) and
inspected under X 100 magnification. Tubules in the sample
and 1-mm calibration grid were quickly drawn on white
paper with a marker. Tubule length was then measured using
a Dietzger planimeter from drawn pictures of samples. The
measured samples were kept at 0°-4°C before incubations,
when the assay was performed immediately, or before freez￾ing for storage at -800C.
Enzyme assays. Assays for AdC and cAMP-PDIE were
performed on disrupted tubular segments. Tubular disrup￾tion (42, 43, 46) was performed as described in our previous
studies (29, 34, 35, 42, 46): The microdissection medium was
aspirated off each sample and replaced with 0.25 gl of hy￾poosmotic medium. All samples were then frozen rapidly on
dry ice and stored at -80°C overnight. Samples were al￾lowed to thaw at 40C before being assayed for enzyme ac￾tivities.
AdC activity was measured according to the method (43)
described in detail previously (29, 30, 34, 35, 42). Tubular
samples (1-3-mm total tubular length) were incubated for
30 min at 30°C in a final volume of 2.5 Il consisting of the
following (final concentrations): 0.25 mM [a-32P]ATP (4
X 106 cpm/sample), 1 mM cAMP, 3.8 mM MgC92, 0.25 mM
EDTA, 100 mM Tris HCI, 20 mM creatinine phosphate, and
1 mg/ml creatine kinase (pH 7.4). The osmolality of this
incubation mixture was -300 mosM (30, 35). Additionally,
in some experiments (Results), NaCl and urea were added
to this incubation mixture in a 1:2 molar ratio to attain a
final osmolality of 800 mosM (30, 35). The reaction was
stopped by freezing the slides on dry ice (29, 34, 42). Each
coverslip plus frozen sample was transferred to individual
precooled 12 X 75-mm glass test tubes followed by 150 ul
of stop solution consisting of 3.3 mM ATP, 5 mM cAMP, 50
mM Tris HCI (pH 7.6), and [3H]cAMP (1 X 104 cpm/sample)
to monitor recovery and cAMP was separated from other
products using Dowex-50 and aluminum oxide columns ac￾cording to the method of Salomon et al. (43, 47). AdC activ￾ity was expressed as femtomoles cAMP per 30 min per mil￾limeter of tubule (30, 43).
cAMP-PDIE activity was assayed by a previously de￾scribed method (46). Tubular samples (0.5-1.5 mm) were
incubated for 10 min at 37°C in 2.5 ul consisting of (final
concentrations) 10 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris￾HCl, pH 8.0 (Mg-EDTA-Tris buffer), and 10-6 M [3H]cAMP.
The medium osmolality was 300 mosM (30,35). The reaction
was stopped by placing the slides on dry ice, followed by
transfer of each sample plus coverslip to individual precooled
12 X 75-mm glass test tubes; 100 Ml of Mg-EDTA-Tris buffer
were added to each tube while still frozen. All tubes were
then immersed in a boiling water bath for 3 min, cooled on
ice, and incubated for a further 15 min at 370C in the pres￾ence of 50 Ml of 5'-nucleotidase (snake venom from Crotalus
atrox; 1 mg/ml). Nucleotides were separated from nucleo￾sides on QAE-Sephadex columns as described in our previous
studies (29, 30, 35, 46).
Measurement of cAMP accumulation in MAL and MCT.
This was described in detail previously (29, 30, 34, 42). Ap￾proximately 6-8 mm of total tubule length of MAL consti￾tuted one sample for basal cAMP accumulation and 2-7 mm
for [8-argininel-vasopressin (AVP) stimulated cAMP accu￾mulation. For MCT, 3.5-8.5 mm of tubule length for basal
cAMP accumulation and 1.5-5 mm for AVP-stimulated
cAMP accumulation were required. After measurement of
tubule length, samples were placed in 2.5 Al of modified
Krebs Ringer buffer (KRB) with or without test agents and
hormone. In some experiments, medium 199 (Gibco Labo￾ratories, Grand Island, NY) was used instead of KRB as an
incubation medium. Results of experiments with the use of
KRB or medium 199 were indistinguishible and therefore
are presented together in the text. In some experiments
(specified in the Results) incubations were conducted in hy￾perosmolar (800 mosM) incubation mixture. In such exper￾iments either KRB or medium 199 was supplemented with
NaCl and urea (1:2 molar ratio) to a final osmolality of 800
mosM (30, 35). All samples are incubated for 10 min at 30°C
and the reaction was stopped by placing the slides on dry
ice. Samples and coverslips were transferred while still fro￾zen into precooled 12 X 75-mm glass test tubes and 100 Al
of 50 mM Na+ acetate added to each, and placed for 3 min
in a boiling water bath (29, 34). Tubule samples and stan￾dards were acetylated and cAMP content determined by
radioimmunoassay (RIA) (29, 30, 34). CPMD or medium 199
at concentrations higher than those used in the present ex￾periments did not interfere with RIA for cAMP. The content
of cAMP in the sample (tubules and incubation medium
together) is expressed in femtomoles per millimeter of tu￾bular length.
NaCI transport-coupled 14C02 production from [14C]lac￾tate in isolated MAL. '4CO2 production from [U-'4C]lactate
was measured according to a modification of the method of
Le Bouffant et al. (48). The principle of the method consists
in the continuous trapping, by simple diffusion into KOH,
of the metabolic product '4CO2 resulting from oxidative
metabolism of a uniformly radiolabeled (U-'4C) substrate by
isolated tubules, incubated in a bicarbonate-free solution
(48). Freshly dissected MAL were transferred onto a 1-mm
diam round coverslip placed on the concave bacteriological
slide. Concave bacteriological slides contained one small
round coverslip for the incubation mixture with tubules and
another coverslip for the droplet of 0.3 M KOH, into which
the '4C02 formed is continuously trapped in the course of
incubation. After length of tubule segments in the sample
was measured, samples were kept at 0°-4°C until the in￾cubation. At the beginning of the assay the microdissection
medium was aspirated from samples with a micropipette
and replaced with 1.0 ,l of metabolic medium that contained
['4C]lactate (4 X 105 cpm/sample) with or without added
drugs, as specified in the Results. The 2-Ml droplet of 0.3 M
KOH was placed on another coverslip situated in the bottom
of a well of a concave bacteriologic slide. Another concave
bacteriologic slide was placed on the top creating a small
chamber. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 20-30 min
at 0°-4°C and incubation was started as follows. The KOH
droplet was removed by soaking into a piece of filter paper,
then fresh 2 Ml of KOH was added, chamber made from two
concave bacteriologic slides was sealed by vaseline coating
and by clamping with two bulldog clamps, and the sealed
chamber was immersed into 30°C water incubation bath.
The incubation time was usually 90-150 min; the same in￾cubation time was used within one experiment. In prelim￾inary experiments we established that 14CO2 production
from [U-_4C]lactate by MAL was proportional to incubation
time (r = 0.98) at least up to 240 min. The reaction was
stopped by placing the slides with samples on a block of dry
ice. The coverslips with 0.3 M KOH, still frozen, were then
quickly transferred with forceps into the scintillation vial

counting. Samples prepared in exactly the same way but
without tubules were used as blanks and blank values were
subtracted to calculate "4CO2 produced by the MAL seg￾ments. In preliminary experiments, it was established that
"4CO2 production from ['4C]lactate is proportional (r = 0.99)
to length of tubule in the sample up to 3 mmn. The rate of
"4CO2 production is expressed in femtomoles of 14CO2 gen￾erated from [U-_4C]lactate per 60 min millimeter of tubule
length.
Several criteria have been used by others (48-51) to doc￾ument that oxidation of substrates in thick ascending loop
of Henle is closely coupled to lumen-to-interstitium NaCl
cotransport (48-52). In preliminary experiments we con￾firmed, using similar criteria, that metabolism of [ 4C]lactate
to 14CO2 in our system is coupled to continuing NaCl co￾transport in MAL. Inclusion of loop diuretic furosemide or
replacement of NaCI in the metabolic medium with equi￾molar LiCl resulted in marked suppression of ['4C]lactate
oxidation (Table I). These results closely agree with obser￾vations from other laboratories (48-52).
Measurement of PG formation. The method used (53)
was described in detail in our previous study (54). All pre￾parative procedures were conducted at 00-40C. The kidney
was removed under anesthesia, divided with a razor blade
into outer (red) medulla and papilla (inner medulla), minced,
and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer at speed 5
in a 100 mM Tris-HCI buffet, pH 7.4 (1:3, wt/vol). The
homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g. The
pellet was resuspended in the same volume of Tris-HCI
buffer and was centrifuged again at 10,000 g for 10 min.
Pooled supernatants were suspended in teflon-glass Potter
homogenizer and were diluted into 1:1 with Tris-HCl buffer
and then ultracentrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 g. The pel￾let, microsomal fraction, was resuspended in 500 1l of 100
mM Tris-HCI buffer, the aliquots were quickly frozen on
dry ice, and were stored at -80°C. Protein content in the
microsomal fraction was determined by the method of
Lowry et al. (55) as in previous studies (37, 38, 54). In the
preliminary experiments, it was ascertained that conversion
of [14C]arachidonic acid to ['4C]PGE2 was linearly propor￾tional to microsomal protein up to 30 Ag/tube. Enzymatic
reactions were carried out in Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.5) for
10 min at 300C. The incubation mixture (200 u1) consisted
of the following (final concentrations): 10 1uM [1-'4C]-

arachidonic acid (8 X 105 cpm); 1 mM GSH, 1 mM L-epi￾nephrine, and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (53, 54). Incu￾bations were terminated by adding 15 ,ul of 4 N formic acid.
The mixture was extracted twice successively with 600 Isl
of chloroform/methanol (2:1, vol/vol; acidified with HCI to
pH 3.5), and the extracted samples were dried under a
stream of N2 gas (53, 54). The dried residue was dissolved
in 100 Ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, vol/vol; pH 3.5).
Extracts were chromatographed on silica gel G thin-layer
plates, as previously described (53, 54). Areas corresponding
to PGF2., PGE2, and arachidonic acid (54) were scraped off
the plates and the radioactivity was determined by liquid
scintillation counting (54). Blank values were determined
from complete incubation mixtures without added micro￾somes.
In another series of experiments, we measured immuno￾reactive PGE2 accumulated in the incubation medium of
papillary and medullary tissute slices. Slices prepared by Sta￾die-Riggs slicer were quickly weighed and then incubated
(100 mg wet wt/6 ml) in a medium containing 140 mM
NaCl, 5 mM KCI, 10 mM Na acetate, 10 mg glucose, 2 mM
NaH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaC12, 0.01 mM ara￾chidonic acid, and 20 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.4). After 60-min
incubation at 300C, the incubation was stopped by acidifi￾cation with 1 N HCI to pH 3.5. The incubation medium was
extracted (1:3, vol/vol) with a mixture of chloroform/meth￾anol (2:1, vol/vol; pH 3.5). The extract was dried under a
stream of N2 then suspended in 1 ml of 10 MM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) and frozen and stored at -80°C until RIA
for PGE2. Blanks were run through the same procedure
without the tissue. PGE2 was determined in samples by spe￾cific RIA described in detail elsewhere (56, 57).
Statistical evaluation of the results was made with use of
Student's t test, as specified in Results. P > 0.05 were con￾sidered nonsignificant.
Solutions and materials. The microdissection medium
was a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (43)
that was used in our previous studies (29, 34, 35, 42), con￾sisting of (in final concerntrations): 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCI,
0.8 mM MgSO4, 0.33 mM Na2HPO4, 1.0 mM MgC92, 10 mM
Tris-HCI, 0.25 mM CaC12, pH 7.4. The composition of the
collagenase medium was identical to that of the microdis￾section medium except that the CaCl2 concentration was 1
mM and it included collagenase (0.1%, wt/vol), bovine
serum albumin (0.1%, wt/vol), and hyaluronidase (0.1%, wt/
vol). In some experiments, instead of modified HBSS, we
used medium 199 as a microdissection medium or, after the
addition of collagenase, instead of the above described col￾lagenase medium. Results with the use of medium 199 in
place of modified HBSS were indistinguishable. Medium 199
was, as mentioned above, used in some experiments instead
of modified KRB in incubations for the determination of
cAMP metabolism, with identical results. The hypoosmotic
medium contained (in final concentrations): 1 mM MgCl2,
0.25 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mM
Tris HC1 (pH 7.4). Modified KRB contained 140 mM NaCl,
5 mM KC1, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 0.8 mM CaC12, 10 mM sodium
acetate, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM Tris, 2.0 mM NaH2PO4, pH

RESULTS
The effects of CPMD on tissue and urinary solutes
in vivo. Water and solute excretion in DI rats was
studied in a group treated with CPMD or with placebo
(Methods). In concordance with previous reports (3-
5, 8, 18), while on ad lib. water intake, CPMD treat￾ment did not alter urine flow, Uosm, UosmV, UNa+V, and
UK+V (Table II). Likewise, at the end of the experiment
CPMD-treated rats did not differ from controls in UcrV
(controls: 3.8±0.3 mg Cr/100 g body wt/24 h, n
= 7; CPMD-treated: 4.2±0.2 Cr/100 g body wt/24 h,
n = 7; mean+SEM). Analysis of solute content showed
that concentrations of Na+, and to a much lesser degree
urea, were significantly enhanced in the medulla and
in the papilla, but not in the cortex of CPMD-treated
rats; tissue contents of K+ and of H20 did not change
(Table III). Consequently, the total medullary and to￾tal tissue osmolality was significantly increased as a
result of CPMD administration. The extent of differ￾ences between Uosm and papillary tissue osmolality was
markedly, more than two times greater in CPMD￾treated rats than in controls (Fig. 1).
Maximum diluting ability was determined by water￾loading test in another group of animals (Methods).
Before the water loading test, UOSm of control DI rats
(300±33 mosM; mean±SEM; n = 5) did not differ from
CPMD-treated DI rats (294±30 mosM; mean±SEM;
n = 5). However, after the water load, minimal Uosm
achieved by CPMD-treated DI rats (204±4 mosM;
mean±SEM; n = 4) was significantly higher (P < 0.005,
t test) than minimal Usm in control DI rats (131±13
mosM; mean±SEM; n = 5).
Metabolism of cAMP in MCT and MAL. We
found no difference in accumulation of cAMP, basal
or stimulated with 1 AM AVP, between MCT from
control DI rats and DI rats treated with CPMD (Table
IV). Also, when assayed in medium of higher osmo￾lality (800 mosM), the cAMP response to submaximal
(0.2 nM) or maximal (1 jiM) doses of AVP was not
increased in MCT dissected from CPMD-treated rats
(data not shown). On the other hand, in the presence
of 1 jIM AVP, the cAMP accumulation was markedly
enhanced in MAL from CPMD-treated DI rats, com￾pared with DI controls (Table IV). Similarly, cAMP
accumulation in the presence of VP was enhanced in
the MAL of normal rats preincubated in vitro with
added 0.1 mM CPMD, however, the same preincu￾bation with CPMD did not increase cAMP accumu￾lation in MCT (Table V).
AdC activity in MCT or in MAL, basal or stimulated
with submaximal and maximal doses of AVP, was not
different between control DI rats and CPMD-treated
DI rats (Table VI). Also no differences were observed
between AdC activities in MCT and in MAL from
control DI rats and CPMD-treated DI rats when as￾TABLE II

in medium with higher osmolality (800 mosm). The
AdC activity assayed in the presence of 1 ,uM AVP in
MAL from CPMD-treated DI rats (383±38 fmol
cAMP/30 min per mm tubule length; mean±SEM, n

from control DI rats (211±32 fmol/30 min per mm

experiments); the basal activities of AdC were not dif￾ferent. AdC activity, basal or stimulated by 1 ,M AVP,
measured in hyperosmolar medium (800 mosM),
showed no difference between MCT of control DI rats
and MCT from CPMD-treated rats.
Activity of cAMP-PDIE (expressed in femtomoles
cAMP per millimeter per min; mean±SEM of n sam￾ples from five experiments) in control MCT (68.8±3.1;
n = 24) was not different from MCT in CPMD-treated
DI rats (68.0±3.1; n = 25). Likewise, cAMP-PDIE ac￾tivity in MAL from control DI rats (62.1±3.1; n = 28)
did not differ from MAL from CPMD-treated DI rats
(63.1±4.4; n = 24).

from CPMD-treated DI rats was markedly elevated
(A + 113%±33; P < 0.05; paired t test; four experi￾ments) compared with MAL from DI controls (Table
VII). When i4CO2 production from [14C]lactate in MAL
was measured with or without the presence of maxi￾mum inhibitory dose (1 mM) of furosemide, only the
i4C02 production from [i4C]lactate that was suppres￾sible only furosemide was higher in CPMD-treated
MAL (Fig. 2).
PG synthesis. PG synthesis in medulla and papilla
of CPMD-treated rats was first assessed by conversion

fractions of medulla and papilla (53). The conversion
rate of [i4C]arachidonic acid to [14C]PGE2 (expressed
in nanomoles [i4cIPGE2 per 20 min per milligram pro￾tein; mean±SEM) by microsomal fraction from papilla
of CPMD-treated DI rats (119±51; n = 6) did not
differ from microsomal fraction of control DI rats
(97±26; n = 6). Also, the conversion rate of microsomes
from medulla of CPMD-treated DI rats (42±11; n
= 6) was not lower than in control DI rats (39±15;
n = 6).

DISCUSSION
As recounted in the Introduction a number of hy￾potheses were proposed to explain the mechanism by
which CPMD enhances antidiuretic effect of VP. In
the present study cellular actions of CPMD were, to
our knowledge, for the first time directly analyzed spe￾cifically in MCT and in MAL of mammalian kidney.
We also examined the hitherto unexplored effect of
CPMD on renal corticopapillary gradient of solutes.
All our studies with in vivo CPMD administration were
conducted in DI rats devoid of endogenous VP (58),
to exclude the possibility of CPMD interaction with
even small amounts of endogenous VP that might be
released even in well water-hydrated normal animals.
In full agreement with previous reports by other
investigators (3-5, 18, 28), we observed that admin￾istration of CPMD alone to DI rats maintained on ad
lib. water intake caused no change (Table II) in urine
flOW, UOSm, UKV, UNaV, UosmV, and UCrV. However,
medullary and papillary tissue osmolality, mainly Na+
content, was increased and consequently corticopapil￾lary gradient of solutes was significantly enhanced in
CPMD-treated rats (Table III). Even in total absence
of VP, residual basal water permeability of collecting
tubules permits some degree of osmotic equilibration
(32, 59). Increased tissue osmolality of medulla and
papilla due to CPMD treatment (Table III) did not
result in a detectable difference in UOSm in DI rats on
ad lib. water intake (Table II). However, under con￾ditions of water loading (Results), CPMD-treated DI

rats had higher minimal UoSm, suggesting that the ef￾fect of increased papillary osmolality and tubule-to￾interstitium gradient is manifested under these con￾ditions. These findings appear to be analogous to ob￾servations of Stoff et al. (33) in DI rats, and Pokracki
et al. (10) on water-hydrated CPMD-treated normal
rats.
The mechanism by which CPMD increases corti￾copapillary gradient of solutes should be briefly con￾sidered. Since CPMD increased corticopapillary gra￾dient (Table III) of solutes in DI rats devoid of VP,
the VP as a factor promoting solute gradient buildup
(45, 58, 60) is obviously not involved. This feature sug￾gests that CPMD treatment, directly or indirectly, in￾fluenced some other factor(s) in the renal countercur￾rent concentrating system that is essential to build up
and maintain medullary and papillary hypertonicity
(32, 59). The medullary and papillary hypertonicity
depends on several processes, but primarily on the lu￾men-to-interstitium transport of NaCl in thick as￾cending limb of Henle's loop (32, 35); blockade of this
NaCl transport in rat MAL by "loop diuretics" (61)
is expected to abolish corticopapillary solute gradient
(32, 59). Therefore, we considered a possibility that
CPMD treatment intensified NaCl reabsorption in
MAL and caused increased deposition of Na+ and
other solutes into medullary and papillary interstitium.
We addressed this question at least in an indirect
way. Several recent studies (49-52) documented that
oxidative metabolism of thick ascending limb of

Henle's loop (48-52) is closely coupled with NaCl co￾transport (48-52), a finding supported by several lines
of evidence. Blocking of luminal NaCl entry into cells
by loop diuretics (48-52) and/or removal of trans￾ported ions Na+, Cl-, or both (48-52), causes a marked
decrease in oxidative metabolism of these epithelial
cells, which is manifested and detected either as de￾creased oxygen consumption (49-52) or decreased
14Co2 generation from '4C-labeled mitochondrial sub￾strates (48). Our prelirninary experiments (Table I)
indeed indicated that the rate of oxidative metabolism
coupled to NaCl cotransport could be assessed also in
MAL microdissected from rat kidney by measuring
14CO2 formation for [14C]lactate (48). Another variant
of the measurement of 14CO2 production from radio￾labeled substrates was successfully applied in studies
of oxidative metabolism in various microdissected tu￾bular segments, including MAL (62), showing the fea￾sibility of this method. We found that in MAL dis￾sected from CPMD-treated rats, the rate of [14C]lactate
oxidation to 14CO2 is about doubled when compared
with controls (Table VII, Fig. 2). The observation that
increased 4CO2 production from [I4C]lactate in MAL
from CPMD-treated rats is not found when 1 mM fu￾rosemide was added indicates that the increased oxi￾dative metabolism in MAL is indeed coupled to NaCl
cotransport (Fig. 2). We therefore suggest, with all due
caution concerning indirectness of this evidence, that
our findings are compatible with the possibility that
CPMD treatment enhances NaCl reabsorption in MAL
(Fig. 3 C). Consequently, the increased NaCI reab￾TABLE VI

copapillary gradient of solutes (Table III). Our inter￾pretation is also compatible with our finding (Table
III) that increased total papillary osmolality in CPMD￾treated DI rats is mainly contributed to by enhanced
content of NaCl (>60%) rather than urea (<10%).
Micropuncture (63) and microperfusion (64) studies
indicated that PG, namely PGE2, can inhibit NaCl
reabsorption in MAL; moreover, the question of the
role of PG was raised in studies of CPMD action con￾ducted on amphibian urinary bladder (19, 24). We
found no evidence that treatment with CPMD in vivo
would inhibit PG synthesis in renal medulla and pa￾pilla. It is noteworthy that the effect of CPMD treat￾ment-in terms of enhanced 14CO2 formation from
[4C]ilactate in MAL-persists in extensively rinsed
microdissected tubules; in addition, epithelial cells of
MAL are virtually devoid of PG-synthetizing capacity
(54). Finally, two different sulfonylureas, CPMD and
glyburide (24), both inhibited PG synthesis and po￾tentiated the effect of VP in urinary bladder in vitro
in an identical way (24). However, in contrast to
CPMD, glyburide (8, 25-27) does not potentiate VP
and rather causes diuresis in man and in experimental
animals (8, 25-27). All these considerations suggest
that, unlike in amphibians in vitro, the inhibition of
PG synthesis is not a basis of CPMD actions on mam￾malian kidney observed in vivo.
Analysis of VP-sensitive cAMP metabolism in MCT
brings no evidence for the proposition that CPMD
treatment increases antidiuretic effect of VP by sen￾sitizing collecting tubules to the VP action at the step
of cAMP generation (Tables IV-VI). Assuming that
the parts of the collecting tubule system adjacent prox￾imally and distally to MCT behave in a similar way
as MCT does, our observations suggest that CPMD does
not potentiate the hydroosmotic effect of VP in mam￾malian collecting tubules, at least not at the step of
cAMP generation. In contrast to the present findings,
we have shown in our preceding studies that well￾known PG cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors enhanced the
stimulation of AdC in MCT by VP (54). Admittedly,
our results do not rule out the theoretical possibility,
for which there is currently no evidence, that CPMD
potentiates action of VP in collecting tubules at the
steps subsequent to cAMP generation.
Enhanced accumulation of cAMP in MAL observed
in response to VP (Tables IV, V) is of interest from
two points of view. First, numerical prevalence of
MAL (compared with MCT) in the rat kidney medulla
(12, 31) may explain why in some earlier studies the
enhanced VP-dependent cAMP formation was ob￾served in whole renal medullary tissue preparations
from CPMD-treated animals (5, 14, 18) or in medul￾lary slices preincubated with CPMD (16), even when
VP-dependent cAMP generation in MCT is not in￾1308 E. Kusano, J. L. Braun-Werness, D. J. Vick, M. J. Keller, and T. P. Dousa
ol

creased (Tables IV-VI). It is not clearly evident by
which mechanism the VP-dependent cAMP accumu￾lation in MAL is increased. Increased sensitivity of
AdC is possible, but we found enhanced stimulation
of AdC in MAL by AVP only under certain testing
conditions (hypertonic medium). It is plausible that
cellular factor(s) other than enzyme activities per se
(12, 13), such as increased availability of substrate
(ATP) or of cofactor(s) (guanosine triphosphate, Mg)
may account for a higher rate of cAMP formation in
situ.
Second, VP was shown recently to stimulate NaCl
reabsorption in MAL (65-67). Therefore, CPMD treat￾ment, by enhancing the VP-dependent cAMP accu￾mulation in MAL, may possibly further stimulate NaCl
reabsorption in this tubular segment. However, it
should be stressed that CPMD treatment increased
corticomedullary gradient of solutes (Table III, Figs.
1 and 3) and enhanced NaCl cotransport-coupled
[14C]lactate oxidation in MAL (Fig. 2, Table VII) even
in the total absence of VP in DI rats. Therefore, the
observed effects of CPMD treatment to increase pap￾illary tonicity, a putative basis of the enhanced anti￾diuretic response to VP (Fig. 3), could and should oc￾cur even in the kidneys where the cAMP system of
MAL is insensitive to VP, as hitherto appears to be the
case of the human kidney (68).
The results of the present studies taken in aggregate
provide a basis for the following working hypothesis
concerning CPMD action in the mammalian kidney
(Fig. 3). Most likely, the main effect of CPMD treat￾ment is an increase in corticopapillary gradient of sol￾utes, namely sodium; this effect is independent of VP.
Our finding of CPMD-enhanced NaCl cotransport￾coupled ['4C]lactate oxidation in MAL suggests that an
increased rate of NaCl reabsorption in MAL is a pri￾mary mechanism for the buildup of greater medullary
and papillary hypertonicity. This increased lumen-to￾interstitium NaCl transport (Fig. 3 A, C) in MAL leads
secondarily to enhanced deposition of urea (32, 59),
according to current models of renal countercurrent
concentrating mechanism (32, 59). Sensitivity of col￾lecting tubules to hydroosmotic action of VP at the
cAMP step is not enhanced by CPMD. As a result of
CPMD treatment, the higher lumen-to-interstitium
transepithelial osmotic gradient in collecting tubules
provides greater osmotic driving force for water reab￾sorption (Fig. 3 C) but this can be manifested on ad
lib. water intake only when exogenous or endogenous
VP increases water permeability of the collecting tu￾bule wall (Fig. 3 D). The proposed mechanism ac￾counts for the fact that in the total absence of VP, as
in DI rats or in DI patients, CPMD alone does not
increase Uosm or decrease urine flow, since it neither
mimics nor potentiates VP effect on water permeabil￾ity of collecting tubules (Fig. 3 C). Increased intersti￾tial tonicity thus causes that the same quantum of VP
administered or released into the circulation, which
increases water permeability of collecting tubules to
the same degree, will result in greater antidiuresis, i.e.,
higher Uosm and lower urine flow, in the CPMD￾treated kidney than in the nontreated kidney (Fig. 3
B and D).
In spite of its stimulation of NaCl reabsorption in
MAL, CPMD treatment alone does not detectably de￾crease UOsm or increase urine flow (1, 3-5) in the final
urine (Table II, Fig. 3 A, C). The most likely expla￾nation is a' secretion of NaCl into lumen of distal cor￾tical convoluted tubules documented in a recent study
(69), which causes that hypotonicity of tubular fluid
achieved in a "diluting segment" (mainly MAL) can￾not be maintained in distal cortical segments. Accord￾ingly, although enhanced NaCl reabsorption in MAL
contributes by buildup of medullary and papillary
osmolality to greater antidiuretic response to VP, it
does not enhance in the same time dilution of final
urine.
Many points pertaining to the proposed CPMD ac￾tion on urine concentration still remain to be clarified.
In particular, it remains to be determined in future'
studies whether CPMD always acts on tubules directly,
or through some secondary mechanism(s) after its ad￾ministration in vivo. The question naturally arises
whether renal effects of CPMD may be a consequence
of its action on insulin secretion and hypoglycemia.
Sulfonylureas other than CPMD, i.e., tolazamide, gly￾buride, and acetohexamide have hypoglycemic and
other metabolic effects analogous to CPMD, but these
compounds do not enhance VP-induced antidiuresis;
on the contrary, they are diuretic in DI rats and DI
men (8, 25-27). These comparisons argue strongly,
albeit indirectly, against the notion that hypoglycemic
action of CPMD is the basis of the observed renal ef￾fects. However, elucidation of molecular mechanism
of CPMD effect will require future detailed studies.
Also, the proposed effect of CPMD to stimulate NaCl
reabsorption in MAL (Fig. 3) ought to be confirmed
in direct studies on isolated MAL. Finally, a theoretical
possibility that CPMD might increase renal tissue to￾nicity also through an effect on medullary blood flow
(32, 59) or might act on other tubular sites (8) remains
to be explored.
Thus, in conclusion, the present study suggests that
CPMD increases antidiuretic effect of VP in mam￾malian kidney by increasing medullary and papillary
osmolality, primarily by acting on thick ascending
limb of Henle's loop. The proposed mechanism of
CPMD action, if validated by future studies, could
lead to search for more potent and more specific com￾pounds that would stimulate selectively NaCI transport

FIGURE 3 Schematic oUtline of the proposed mechanism by which CPMD enhances antidiuretic
response to VP in hypothalamic diabetes insipidus. The small but distinct corticomedullary
gradient of solutes is maintained in DI rats (Table III), even in the total absence of VP (45,
58) primarily by NaCI reabsorption in MAL. (A) In the absence of VP tubular fluid cannot
equilibrate osmotically with interstitium since collecting tubules are virtually impermeable to
H20; as a consequence the final urine is hypotonic (Table II). (B) The administration of VP
increases permeability of collecting tubule to water permitting equilibration and resulting in
hypertonic urine (1, 3-5); maximal Uo,m is limited by osmolality of papillary interstitium. (C)
Administration of CPMD causes an increase of NaCl reabsorption from MAL into interstitium
and consequently an increase of medullary and papillary osmolality (Table III). However, in
the absence of VP virtual impermeability of collecting tubules to water does not allow osmotic
equilibration and, in spite of higher papillary tonicity, the utine remains hypotonic (compare
with A). (D) VP is administered to CPMD-treated DI animals, in which corticopapillary gradient
of solutes is increased (as in C). VP increases water permeability of collecting tubules, permits
osmotic equilibration and results in generation of hypertonic urine. The higher osmotic driving
force (collecting tubule lumen-to-interstitium osmotic gradient) results in higher U,sm and lower
urine flow (1, 3-5, 8) compared with VP effect without CPMD treatment (B).

in MAL-"loop antidiuretics." CPMD and other pu￾tative compounds with analogous mode of action could
be of potential use in the treatment of those urinary
concentrating defects due to washout of medullary and
papillary solutes (32, 59, 70).
