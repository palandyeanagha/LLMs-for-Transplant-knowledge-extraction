Abstract
Background: Whole-exome sequencing has identified the causes of several Mendelian diseases by analyzing multiple
unrelated cases, but it is more challenging to resolve the cause of extremely rare and suspected Mendelian diseases
from individual families. We identified a family quartet with two children, both affected with a previously unreported
disease, characterized by progressive muscular weakness and cardiomyopathy, with normal intelligence. During the
course of the study, we identified one additional unrelated patient with a comparable phenotype.
Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing (Complete Genomics platform), whole-exome sequencing
(Agilent SureSelect exon capture and Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform), SNP genotyping (Illumina
HumanHap550 SNP array) and Sanger sequencing on blood samples, as well as RNA-Seq (Illumina HiSeq platform)
on transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines.
Results: From whole-genome sequence data, we identified RBCK1, a gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase,
as the most likely candidate gene, with two protein-truncating mutations in probands in the first family. However,
exome data failed to nominate RBCK1 as a candidate gene, due to poor regional coverage. Sanger sequencing
identified a private homozygous splice variant in RBCK1 in the proband in the second family, yet SNP genotyping
revealed a 1.2Mb copy-neutral region of homozygosity covering RBCK1. RNA-Seq confirmed aberrant splicing of
RBCK1 transcripts, resulting in truncated protein products.
Conclusions: While the exact mechanism by which these mutations cause disease is unknown, our study
represents an example of how the combined use of whole-genome DNA and RNA sequencing can identify a
disease-predisposing gene for a novel and extremely rare Mendelian disease.
Background
Over 5,500 confirmed Mendelian diseases have been
described in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) database as of June 2013, but a third of them
do not have a known molecular basis. With the rapid
development and deployment of next-generation sequen￾cing techniques, this situation is changing rapidly [1,2].
Over the past a few years, exome sequencing has been
successfully used to identify candidate predisposing genes
for multiple Mendelian diseases, and it is likely that this
technique will impact clinical medicine in the relatively
near future [3,4]. However, we also note two important
points from recently published studies. First, the vast
majority of Mendelian sequencing studies used exome
sequencing rather than whole-genome sequencing. This
is due to several reasons, such as the lower cost of
exome sequencing, the assumption that Mendelian dis￾eases are more likely to be caused by mutations at exons
than non-coding regions, and the concern that too much

information on genomic variants will be too difficult to
interpret bioinformatically. Second, the vast majority of
published studies attempted to solve previously known
Mendelian diseases, rather than novel suspected Mende￾lian phenotypes that are sometimes referred to as ‘idio￾pathic’ diseases. This is most likely because multiple DNA
samples are already readily available for known Mendelian
diseases to enable statistical support for discovered var￾iants/genes. However, several examples demonstrated that
it is feasible to identify disease-predisposing mutations for
idiopathic diseases from only one or two families, if other
prior information can help trim down candidate genes
into specific linkage regions or chromosomes (such as the
X-linked disease Ogden syndrome [5]).
The current study was initiated by the discovery of a
potential novel syndrome at The Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia in 2009. We were presented with a brother
and sister with a previously uncharacterized condition,
which was initially suspected to be a glycogen storage
disease type IV. Both children had progressive muscular
weakness (myopathy) and cardiomyopathy, with normal
intelligence (Table 1), and the parents were phenotypi￾cally normal. The neuromuscular weakness in both pro￾bands started around the age of 8 years, together with
progressive cardiomyopathy. Additional assessment by
the clinical genetics lab, with comprehensive evaluation
of all known glycogen storage disease genes, failed to
substantiate the hypothesis that this is a known glycogen
storage disease. Given the failure of candidate gene analy￾sis, it seemed intuitive that whole-genome techniques
might be required to identify the disease-predisposing
mutations.
Materials and methods
Sample collection and characterization
In 2009, the two affected siblings and their parents were
recruited to participate in a study to identify disease
genes (Figure 1a). The probands were initially suspected
to have a glycogen storage disease type IV, but extensive
clinical genetics testing failed to identify the disease
causing gene. In late 2011, we enrolled one additional
patient with comparable phenotype (Figure 1b), through
a referral by the first family under study. This patient
was also originally suspected to have a glycogen storage
disease type IV, but all clinical genetics tests failed to
identify the exact genetic cause. The Institutional
Review Board of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
has approved the study, and written informed consents
were obtained from all study participants. The study
conformed to the Helsinki Declaration and we have
been given permission to publish the manuscript.
SNP genotyping and data analysis
All genome-wide SNP genotyping for the family was
performed using the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip
at the Center for Applied Genomics at the Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia. Standard data normalization
procedures and canonical genotype clustering files pro￾vided by Illumina were used to process the genotyping
signals and generate genotype calls.
The Illumina GenomeStudio software was used to
process genotyping data and visualize signal intensity
patterns at large-scale copy number variants (CNVs)
and region-of-homozygosity (ROH) events. The log R
ratio and B allele frequency measures for all markers for
all samples were directly calculated and exported from
the Illumina BeadStudio software. The CNV calls and
ROH calls were generated using PennCNV (version
2009Aug27) [6], which utilizes an integrated hidden
Markov model that incorporates multiple sources of
information, including total signal intensity and allelic
intensity ratio at each SNP marker, the distance between
neighboring SNPs, and the allele frequency of SNPs.
Family information was not used in CNV calling. The
default program parameters, library files and the geno￾mic wave adjustment routine [7] in the detect_cnv.pl
program were used in generating CNV calls. The scan_-
region.pl program in PennCNV was used to map called
CNVs to specific genes and exons, using the RefSeq
gene definitions.

Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing
The whole-genome sequencing was performed by Com￾plete Genomics (Mountain View, California, USA), and
we provided 10 μg DNA samples to the company for
the sequencing service. The DNA was sequenced with a
nanoarray-based short-read sequencing-by-ligation tech￾nology [8], including an adaptation of the pairwise end￾sequencing strategy [9]. The original sequence data were
mapped to National Center for Biotechnology Informa￾tion (NCBI) reference genome build 36 in 2010. Recently,
the short reads alignment and variant calling were re-per￾formed by the Complete Genomics pipeline version 2.2
as previously reported [8], using NCBI reference genome
build 37. Each variant was assigned a quality score, which
was calculated as -10 × log10[P(call is true)/P(call is
false)], representing the confidence in the call. We
removed variants that do not pass the default quality fil￾ter, including homozygous calls with quality scores less
than 20, or heterozygous calls with quality scores less
than 40. The variants passing the quality control thresh￾old were used for downstream analysis.
The whole-exome sequencing was performed in house
at the University of Pennsylvania. We used the Agilent
SureSelect Human All Exon kit for exon capture on
5 μg input DNA samples, and then used the Illumina
Genome Analyzer II platform for next-generation
sequencing. We generated 137 million paired-end reads,
using two separate lanes from the Genome Analyzer.
Data analysis was performed using the SeqMule pipeline
[10], which is an automated pipeline for analysis of
high-throughput sequencing data. It integrates BWA
[11], Bowtie [12], Bowtie2 [13], SOAP2 [14], SOAPsnp
[15], GATK [16], SAMtools [17], VarScan [18], Picard
and other popular analysis tools, and therefore gives
users the flexibility to choose their preferred aligner and
variant caller. In our analysis, we used the variant calls
generated by the BWA alignments and GATK indel rea￾lignment procedure, similar to as previously reported
[19].
Validation by Sanger sequencing
Selected putative variants were examined among all family
members using Sanger sequencing methods. Given the
position of variants, the PCR primers were designed to
encompass the candidate position, ensuring that common
SNPs are not covered by the primers. The ABI Prism 3500
sequencer was used for sequencing, and the resulting *.
AB1 files were loaded into the ABI Sequence Scanner ver￾sion 1.0 for further analysis and genotype calling. All
sequence traces were manually reviewed to ensure the
reliability of the genotype calls.
Variant annotation and prioritization
We used the ANNOVAR software [20] for variant annota￾tion, analysis and filtering. Besides gene-based annotation,
we used a custom ‘variants reduction’ pipeline to identify a
list of candidate genes with the following criteria: (1) iden￾tify variants causing splicing or protein-coding changes,

including stop loss and stop gain variants; (2) remove var￾iants in the 1000 Genomes Project April 2012 release, the
NHLBI-6500 Exomes (European Americans or African
Americans), the CG46 database compiled from unrelated
individuals sequenced by the Complete Genomics plat￾form and the dbSNP nonFlagged database with version
137; (3) requires a recessive mode of inheritance, with at
least two deleterious mutations found in each proband.
RNA-Seq analysis
We generated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lympho￾blastoid cells for all study participants, using their periph￾eral blood mononuclear cells. Total RNA was extracted
from cultured cells, and we made sequencing libraries
using the Illumina TruSeq protocol. The Illumina
HiSeq2000 sequencer was used for generating paired-end
sequence data with 101 bp read length. We used the
Tophat [21] version 2.0.4 and Cufflinks [22] version 2.0.2
software tools for sequence alignments and for quantify￾ing gene expression levels. The resulting BAM files were
visualized in the Integrative Genomics Viewer [23] to
identify aberrant splicing patterns.
Results and discussion
Discovery of RBCK1 as a disease candidate gene
SNP genotyping revealed multiple CNVs in the two pro￾bands in the first family (Figure 1a). However, we did
not identify any de novo CNVs or homozygous deletions
shared by the two siblings. Therefore, in 2010, we
started to use next-generation sequencing to compre￾hensively assay the genome of the patients, motivated by
the successful identification of disease-predisposing
genes for Mendelian diseases such as Miller syndrome
and Kabuki syndrome [24,25] published in the same
year.
At the time of the study, whole-genome sequencing
was prohibitively expensive, and the relative merits of
whole-genome versus whole-exome sequencing were
not well established. Therefore, we decided to proceed
with a modified approach, by sequencing one patient
with whole-genome sequencing and the other by whole￾exome sequencing. The whole-genome sequencing was
performed by Complete Genomics, and an average fold
coverage of 81× was achieved genome-wide with excel￾lent evenness, ensuring high quality genotype calls for
the patient. We identified 3,910,156 genetic variants for
subsequent functional annotation and prioritization. In
parallel, we performed exome sequencing in-house on
the other patient. We generated 137 million paired-end
reads, achieving an average coverage of 118× over
designed capture regions, and with >90% of target
regions covered by ≥10 reads. Therefore, the whole-gen￾ome and whole-exome data have excellent coverage sta￾tistics, even by today’s standards.
We first analyzed the whole-genome data to find
potential disease-predisposing genes, assuming a reces￾sive disease model as the most likely possibility, given
that this is a brother and sister pair arising from pheno￾typically normal parents. We utilized the ANNOVAR
‘variants reduction’ pipeline [20] to identify a set of can￾didate genes that are more likely to be the disease pre￾disposing genes for the disease (Figure S1 in Additional
file 1). Our goal is to identify a list of prioritized rare
variants, and then assess the variant transmission pat￾terns across the pedigree. We focused on the list of
non-synonymous SNVs, splice variants and indels in
exonic regions, given that they might be more interpre￾table and perhaps more likely to be disease predisposing.
This pipeline leads to a list of 30 most probably disease￾predisposing genes. We manually reviewed the results to
remove pseudogenes and questionable variant calls due
to mis-alignments (for example, KCNJ12, HYDIN), olfac￾tory receptors (for example, OR9G9, OR9G1), as well as
‘dispensable’ genes with high frequency loss-of-function
mutations in populations [20,26], and we were left with
a list of six candidate genes. We next performed Sanger
sequencing to validate these variants and examine their
familial transmission patterns. We failed to validate the
mutations in LRP5 and MUC6. Additionally, while we
were able to validate the mutations in FAM81B and
MTRNR2L1, the mutations do not follow expected
inheritance patterns (both mutations come from the
same parent). Therefore, two genes were left as our final
set of candidate genes, including TATA box-binding
protein-associated factor 1-like (TAF1L; MIM 607798)
and RanBP-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger containing
1 (RBCK1; MIM 610924).
TAF1L is a single-exon gene that evidently arose by
retrotransposition of a processed TAF(II)250 mRNA
during primate evolution [27]. TAF1L is homologous to
TAF(II)250 and is expressed specifically in the testis. It
may act as a functional substitute for TAF1/TAF(II)250
during male meiosis, when sex chromosomes are tran￾scriptionally silenced [27]. The two TAF1L mutations
(P1266R and K1094E) are confirmed in both cases as
compound heterozygotes, with each mutation inherited
from a separate parent.
RBCK1 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that has a
pivotal role in determining the specificity of the system
by recognizing target substrates [28]. RBCK1 is a more
promising disease candidate gene, as it has two truncat￾ing mutations each inherited from one parent. These
include a nonsense mutation in exon6 (p.Q222X) and a
7 bp frameshift insertion in exon5 (p.E190fs) (Figure 1c,
Figure 2a, b). We note that loss of function variants in
RBCK1 appear to be very rare in the general population;
for example, there were none in the approximately
6,500 individuals in the Exome Variant Server. We also

note that several other ubiquitin-protein ligase genes
(PARK2, NEDD4, TRIM9, NHLRC1, CBL, TRIM63,
RNF19, and so on) have been implicated in multiple
Mendelian diseases sharing similar phenotypic features
as the current patients.
We used a comparable set of procedures to analyze the
exome-sequencing data. Of note, there are minimal
amounts of overlap of candidate genes from whole-genome
data and whole-exome data, and all the overlapping genes
have been ruled out as potential candidate genes pre￾viously. We next examined why RBCK1 did not confirm as
a candidate gene in the whole-exome data. The genome￾wide variance of the heterozygous allele frequencies [29]
was 0.91%, which did not suggest high amplification arti￾facts. Evaluation of coverage statistics confirmed the overall
good coverage statistics over designed target regions in the
exome (Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Additionally,
on average, exons within RBCK1 were also well covered
(Figure S3A in Additional file 1). However, the two posi￾tions with known mutations were only covered by 4 and 2
reads, respectively, and only one read contained a mutation
(Figure S3B,C in Additional file 1). To further investigate
this, we examined GC content around the two mutation
sites, since it is known that GC content of the fragment
being sequenced affects sequencing coverage [30]. Based
on alignment files, the average insert fragment sizes for
exome sequencing and genome sequencing were 123 bp
and 358 bp, respectively. The GC content around the two
mutation sites were 73.2% and 71.5%, respectively, suggest￾ing potential issues in amplifying these fragments for
exome sequencing. Finally, we also analyzed six additional
exome samples sequenced on the same batch (each sample

on one separate lane), and found that their coverage ranged
from 0 to 6 and 1 to 2 for the two mutation sites, respec￾tively, suggesting that poor coverage on the two mutations
was a common problem for all samples. Similar challenges
in exome data analysis have already been discussed before:
for example, uneven coverage of exome data may result in
true disease-predisposing genes being filtered out during
the variant detection procedure [31]. Therefore, our results
represented another example where although candidate
mutations were located in the coding part of the genome,
they were not detected by exon capture and sequencing.
Validation of RBCK1 in a second family
As this appeared to be an extremely rare disease, we were
cautious not to conclude that these mutations were defini￾tive predisposing events for a novel syndrome at that time.
In late 2011, we obtained one additional patient with com￾parable phenotype, through a referral by the first family
under study. This patient was also originally suspected to
have a glycogen storage disease type IV, but all clinical
genetics tests failed to identify the exact genetic cause.
Therefore, we set out to sequence all exons in RBCK1
using Sanger sequencing in this patient (subject II-3 in
Figure 1b), though parental DNA samples were unfortu￾nately not available for our study. Our sequencing results
identified two homozygous mutations, including an intro￾nic mutation (rs11698154) that has previously been
observed in the 1000 Genomes Project [32] with a minor
allele frequency of 12% (Figure 2d), as well as a previously
unreported mutation (c.456+1G>C) that is located at an
exon-intron boundary, apparently disrupting a canonical
splicing donor site for exon 5 (Figure 2e).
Given the fact that a private mutation was called as
homozygote, we suspected that this might be an artifact of
variant calling, or that there is instead an exonic deletion
at this position. To investigate this, we genotyped the
patient using Illumina HumanHap550 SNP arrays and
analyzed the signal intensity data to find deletions [6].
However, we did not observe any exonic deletions, but
rather discovered that RBCK1 is enclosed in a 1.2 Mb
copy-neutral ROH covering the p-terminal of chromo￾some 20 (Figure 2c). The family history did not have any
evidence of consanguineous marriage, so it is likely that
the RBCK1 ROH was due to a relatively distant shared
ancestry of the two parents, or due to local uniparental
isodisomy.
Confirmation of aberrant splicing by RNA-Seq
To further validate the presence of mutations and/or their
potential impacts on transcript splicing, we subsequently
made Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell
lines from the patients and unaffected mother from family
1, as well as the patient from family 2. In early 2012, using
RNA extracted from these cell lines, we performed
transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) using Illumina
HiSeq2000. On average, we generated 61 million 101 bp
paired-end reads for each subject.
For the patient in the second family (subject II-3),
RNA-Seq data convincingly demonstrated the presence
of a homozygous mutation at the splicing donor site in
exon 5 of the RBCK1 gene, originally found by Sanger
sequencing (Figure 3). This mutation appeared to gener￾ate a ‘read-through’ transcript, that is, intronic regions
between exon 5 and exon 6 were also transcribed. In
comparison, for the proband and his unaffected mother
in the first family (subjects II-1 and I-2), RNA-Seq data
showed the lack of ‘read-through’ transcription between
exon 5 and exon 6 (Figure 3). We bioinformatically pre￾dicted the protein product for the read-through tran￾scripts, and identified multiple pre-mature stop codons
in the hypothetical protein sequence, suggesting that the
transcripts may not be functional, or may be subject to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Interestingly, we also
noted that all three subjects had intronic transcription
between exon 6 and exon 7. However, examination of
RNA-Seq data sets in other projects suggested that
these intronic transcripts exist in all other RNA-Seq
samples, so they may be due to the presence of unanno￾tated exons or other non-coding RNAs.
The gene function for RBCK1 was not well character￾ized, but it was reported to be a component of E3 ubiqui￾tin-protein ligase, which accepts ubiquitin from specific E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, such as UBE2L3/UBCM4,
and then transfers it to substrates [28]. Recently, a study
related HOIL1 (RBCK1) deficiency to a fatal human disor￾der with immunodeficiency, autoinflammation and amylo￾pectinosis [33]. The authors demonstrated that NF-b
activation in response to IL-1b was compromised in
patients’ fibroblasts, but the patients’ mononuclear leuko￾cytes, particularly monocytes, were hyper-responsive to
IL-1b. However, we note that the authors did not prove
that the variants were causal for the observed phenotypes,
since the fibroblast cells from patients may have harbored
other variants. We were unable to garner any evidence on
immunodeficiency or auto-inflammation in the three pro￾bands from two families in our study, although they both
have clear signs of amylopectinosis (glycogen storage dis￾ease type IV), which was the very reason they were
referred to us. We also cannot exclude the possibility that
different mutations in the same RBCK1 gene may lead to
distinct and unrelated phenotypes (immune-related pro￾blems and amylopectinosis). Despite the lack of direct
functional evidence associating the mutations with the
amylopectinosis phenotype, the discovery of a genetic
cause further establishes that this phenotype of interest
may represent a novel syndrome.
In conclusion, whole-genome sequencing identified a
mutation in RBCK1 as possibly predisposing to a novel,

extremely rare Mendelian disease. Together with several
recently published studies [1-3], this example illustrates
the possibility to identify disease-predisposing mutations
for novel idiopathic diseases using a very limited num￾ber of patient samples. However, we also caution that
extensive functional validations are required to assess
why loss of function in the candidate gene leads to the
observed disease phenotypes. Finally, our study also
represents an example where exome sequencing failed
to identify disease genes due to lack of comprehensive
coverage and/or even coverage of the target regions.
With the ever-decreasing cost of whole-genome sequen￾cing, we expect that whole-genome sequencing will be
used much more in the near future for finding the
genetic causes of Mendelian disorders.
