SHORT COMMUNICATION
Morbid obesity rates continue to rise rapidly in the United States
R Sturm1 and A Hattori2
Clinically severe or morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) 440 or 50 kg m 2
) entails far more serious health consequences than
moderate obesity for patients, and creates additional challenges for providers. The paper provides time trends for extreme weight
categories (BMI 440 and 450 kg m 2
) until 2010, using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Between 2000
and 2010, the prevalence of a BMI 440 kg m 2 (type III obesity), calculated from self-reported height and weight, increased by
70%, whereas the prevalence of BMI 450 kg m 2 increased even faster. Although the BMI rates at every point in time are higher
among Hispanics and Blacks, there were no significant differences in trends between them and non-Hispanic Whites. The growth
rate appears to have slowed down since 2005. Adjusting for self-report biases, we estimate that in 2010 15.5 million adult
Americans or 6.6% of the population had an actual BMI 440 kg m 2
. The prevalence of clinically severe obesity continues to be
increasing, although less rapidly in more recent years than prior to 2005.

INTRODUCTION
Over the last three decades, mean body mass index (BMI; weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) has increased
worldwide by 0.4 kg m 2 per decade.1 According to recent studies,
the United States has the highest mean BMI among high-income
countries,1 resulting one in three adults having a BMI 430 kg m 2
based on objective measurement,2 or one in four adults based on
self-reported height and weight.3 The prevalence of (moderate)
obesity may be stabilizing, or at least increases are occurring at
much smaller rates than prior to 2005 in the United States.2–4 This
plateauing may or may not apply to more severe/morbid obesity
(any BMI cutpoint 440 kg m 2
). Few trend estimates exist for
morbid obesity because surveys using objective measurements lack
the sample size, while surveys using self-reported height and
weight require a different interpretation of cutpoints for prevalence
estimates. Between 1986 and 2000, when the prevalence of a BMI
430 kg m 2 based on self-reported height and weight roughly
doubled, the prevalence of a BMI of 40 kg m 2 quadrupled and the
prevalence of a BMI X50 kg m 2 quintupled.5 This paper provides
an update of those trends since 2000.
The typical definition of obesity, a BMI of 430 kg m 2
(irrespective of whether objectively measured or based on self￾report), obscures the heterogeneity among that group. Severely
obese individuals who are 100 or 200 pounds (45–90 kg) or more
overweight have on average far more complex health issues
and encounter very different challenges in the health-care system
than the majority of (moderately) obese individuals (BMI
30–35 kg m 2
). Physician offices and hospitals require additional
resources for severely obese patients who exceed limits on
standard measuring and lifting equipment, and may not fit
standard imaging equipment, operating tables or wheelchairs. It
also affects health-care personnel; the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health started a program in 2009 to
identify evidence-based best practices for handling severely obese
patients to reduce occupational injuries.6
Clinically severe or morbid obesity is not a rare pathological
condition afflicting a fixed proportion of the population, nor is it
directly coupled to the prevalence of moderate obesity. Instead,
severe obesity is part of a population BMI distribution that has
become more heterogeneous (a larger proportion of individuals
far away from the average) while shifting to the right simulta￾neously (an increase in mean BMI).7,8 Fast growth of morbid
obesity has also been reported in other countries.9 Changes in the
prevalence of such severe levels of obesity disproportionately
affect morbidity and health-care costs, because the risks of disease
and severity of conditions rapidly and continuously increase with
higher BMI levels.10
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study analyses data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS), which is a cross-sectional telephone survey of nonin￾stitutionalized adults, between 1986 and 2010.11
Individuals are classified into weight categories based on the BMI
calculated from self-reported weight and height. In addition to the
standard ‘obese’ category, defined as a BMI of X30 kg m 2
, the main
groups of interest are more extreme categories: BMI X40 (type III obesity)
and BMI X50 kg m 2
.
Self-report on average understates weight (more so for women) and
overstates height (more so for men).12 The underreporting of weight
increases with weight, and prevalence at the same cutpoints are therefore
lower than if BMI were calculated by independent measurement. A
cutpoint of 40 for direct measurement would be more comparable to a
cutpoint for self-report of 37.3 for men and 37.0 for women, based on our
calculations using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) in 2007–2008 (we also show this ‘adjusted’ trend). The effect on
relative change trends is relatively minor unless reporting biases change.
A diminishing reporting bias over time, possibly because of increased
awareness about obesity and increased self-monitoring, would lead
to overestimates. We used the NHANES to assess this possibility, but
found no evidence for changes in reporting biases between 1999 and
2008. Similarly, Gorber and Tremblay13 report no change over time in

self-report bias in the United States, although there was an increasing
(rather than diminishing) bias in Canada.
The descriptive statistics in Table 1 use sampling weights and adjust
standard errors for the BRFSS design. The main statistical analysis
underlying Figure 1 uses individual-level logistic regression with an
indicator of weight category as the dependent variable. Time trend is
measured as a linear spline with knots at 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 (that
is, linear trends within each 5-year period, but those slopes can differ
between 1986–1990, 1991–1995, 1996–2000, 2001–2005 and 2006–2010).
The results are adjusted for sociodemographic changes to isolate the
unique trend in obesity rates. Regressors include age (in 5-year intervals),
educational achievement (less than high school, high school, some college,
college degree), racial group (White, Black, Hispanic, other) and sex. State
indicators are included to control for the changing survey participation by
states over time. Tests are based on the regression model, and all results
are statistically significant at Po0.01 unless indicated otherwise. The
adjusted results are based on the sociodemographic characteristics in the
year 2010 survey. We also estimated separate models stratifying by sex and
by race/ethnicity.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the growth rates since 1986, with 1986 rates as
the base. The higher the weight groups, the more rapid the rate
of growth. The percentage of the population with a BMI
450 kg m 2 based on reported height and weight has increased
more than 10-fold. The prevalence of extreme BMI levels
continues to rise at a fast rate, but there is a noticeable (and
statistically significant) slowdown since 2005. This slowdown is
recent as there was no difference in the trend pattern between
2001 and 2005 compared with 1991–1995 or 1996–2000.
At every point in time, the prevalence of obesity differs across
subgroups. For higher levels (BMI 440 kg m 2
), it is about 50%
higher among women than among men, and about double
among non-Hispanic black than among Hispanics or non-Hispanic
Whites (with no major differences between the latter). However,
the trend estimates for all groups are very similar when redraw￾ing Figure 1, using only statistically significant differences, the
lines at every BMI level would be indistinguishable across
subgroups. For all levels of obesity (regardless of cutpoint), the
increases over time are faster among younger age groups (o35 or
40 years).
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for 2000–2010. The final
column uses a cutpoint of 37.3 for men and 37 for women with
self-reported data, resulting in a prevalence rate comparable to a
BMI cutpoint of 40 kg m 2
, using objective measurement. That
rate increased from 3.9% of the population to 6.6% during
the decade, which is about a 70% increase. A cutpoint of 40 based
on the self-reported height and weight gives lower rates of
prevalence, from 2.1 to 3.7%, but a relative increase of 470%.
There is a general pattern also reflected in Figure 1 over a longer
time horizon: the higher the BMI group, the faster the growth rate
in prevalence.
DISCUSSION
These trend estimates indicate that morbid obesity rates (at any
cutpoint 440) in the United States continue to rise rapidly,
although the near-exponential growth has noticeably flattened
out since 2005. The relative rate of increase is similar across
population subgroups, even though the prevalence at every point
in time differs across groups.2 The trajectories do not differ across
groups, but so rather than having different trajectories, the most
disadvantaged group appears to be just a few years ahead of
others.
There are at least three limitations in the BRFSS. First, it excludes
persons who do not have landline telephones, and wireless only
households are more likely to be younger, Black or Hispanic.
Second, response rates have declined over time and the CASRO
response rate in many states is now o50%. The third and most
problematic limitation is that height and weight reporting biases
may change over time, which could have an impact on the self￾reported trend data in this report. Based on the NHANES data
from 1999 to 2008, we do not find any significant change in

reporting biases, but that could be different for the most severely
obese group.
We also use NHANES to calculate cutpoints in the self-reported
data to correspond to objective measurement for a BMI 440 kgm 2
.
Using those cutpoints, our prevalence estimates are within the
confidence intervals of NHANES estimates for every year,
suggesting that NHANES and BRFSS results may actually be more
similar than commonly believed. However, because of the much
larger sample size, BRFSS estimates a highly significant trend
towards continuing increases in severe obesity, even though there
has been a slowdown in recent years.
Clinically severe obesity, far from being a pathological condition
that only affects a fixed percentage of genetically vulnerable
individuals, appears to be an integral part of the US population’s
weight distribution. The traditional clinical approach of targeting
high-risk cases is only temporary and palliative in this situation,
but cannot stem the trend. Although this offers new business
opportunities for providers specializing in treating severe obesity,
the social and human costs are large.
