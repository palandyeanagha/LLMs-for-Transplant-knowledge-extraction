A B S T R A C T To understand the contribution to the
pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia of the different
erythrocyte density types present in the blood of these
patients, we have studied the viscosimetric and he￾modynamic characteristics of four major classes of
hemoglobin SS erythrocytes. We have isolated retic￾ulocytes, discocytes, dense discocytes, and irreversibly
sickled cells (fractions I-IV) on Percoll-Renografin
density gradients. Bulk viscosity was studied in a cone￾plate viscosimeter and the hemodynamic studies were
performed on the isolated, artificially perfused me￾soappendix vasculature of the rat (Baez preparation).
Bulk viscosity measurements at shear rates of 230
s-' demonstrate that when the cells are oxygenated,
fraction I (reticulocyte rich) has a higher viscosity than
expected from its low intracellular hemoglobin con￾centration. The rest of the fractions exhibit moderate
increases in bulk viscosity pari-passu with the corre￾sponding increases in density (mean corpuscular he￾moglobin concentration). When deoxygenated, all cell
fractions nearly doubled their bulk viscosity and the
deoxy-oxy differences remained constant. The Baez
preparation renders a different picture: oxygenated
fractions behave as predicted by the viscosimetric
data, but, when deoxygenated, cell fractions exhibit
dramatically increased peripheral resistance and the

deoxy-oxy difference are directly proportional to cell
density, thus, the largest increases were observed for
fractions III and IV. The differences between the rheo￾logical and the hemodynamic measurements are most
probably due to the different sensitivity of the two
methods to the extent of intracellular polymerization.
These results also demonstrate that the hitherto un￾recognized fraction III cells (very dense discocytes
that change shape very little on deoxygenation) are as
detrimental to the microcirculation as the irreversibly
sickled cell-rich fraction IV. They may, however, in￾duce obstruction by a different mechanism.
As the extent to which these fractions are populated
by erythrocytes varies considerably from patient to
patient, the distribution function of cell densities in
each sickle cell anemia patient might have conse￾quences for the type of pathophysiological events oc￾curring in their microcirculation.
INTRODUCTION
The blood of patients with sickle cell anemia is com￾prised of erythrocytes with a shortened life span, an
increased number of reticulocytes, and, in addition,
dehydrated erythrocytes called irreversibly sickled
cells (ISC),' which are generated by the sickling pro￾cess. By the use of Percoll-Renografin density gradient
fractionation, we have isolated four different subpop￾ulations of erythrocytes in sickle cell anemia patients

characterized by enrichment in either reticulocytes,
discocytes, dense discocytes, or ISC.
In this paper we have systematically characterized
the rheological (bulk viscosity) and hemodynamic
(peripheral resistance in an ex vivo vascular prepa￾ration) properties of each of these classes of cells. The
knowledge of these characteristics will allow a better
understanding of their individual contributions to the
pathophysiology of the disease.
The pathophysiological effects of these different
classes or subpopulations of sickle cells is important
because they are unequally represented in a given
patient (1, 2) and the distribution function varies from
patient to patient (1).
The data presented here make particular use of the
Baez preparation, an isolated denervated mesenteric
vasculature of the rat (3). This preparation resembles
the human microcirculation in vascular dimensions
and branching patterns and is a physiologically rele￾vant system.
METHODS
Fresh heparinized samples were obtained by venipuncture
from normal adults (n = 4) and from sickle cell patients (n
= 6) who were out of crises and had not received blood
transfusion in the preceding 4 mo.
Density gradient fractionation. Hemoglobin (Hb)SS
erythrocyte subpopulations were separated on Percoll (col￾loidal silica coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone; Pharmacia
Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ)-Renografin-76 (66% dis￾trizoate meglumine and 10% meglumine sodium; E. R.
Squibb & Sons, Inc., Princeton, NJ) density gradients. There
gradients were prepared using a ratio of Percoll/Renografin￾76/water/0.9% NaCl of 3.5:1.7:4.1:0.7, as described by Vet￾tore et al. (4). The resulting osmolarity was 320±5 mosmol
and the pH, before the addition of cells, was 7.50±0.05. The
hematocrit (Hct) was adjusted to 40-45% before the cells
and plasma were added to the gradient mixture. In these
preparative studies, 1.0 ml of whole heparinized blood was
added to 9 ml of gradient mix. The tubes were spun for 20
min at 17,000 rpm at 5°C and the cells were harvested within
0.5 h after centrifugation. No significant change in mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) or other cel￾lular properties (enzyme levels, ATP, 02 equilibrium, K+
efflux) was noted after fractionation of cells. No changes in
density were observed when washed, fractionated cells were
subjected to density gradient centrifugation a second time
and compared with the densities of the original whole blood.
The whole blood was separated into four major fractions
(I-IV) according to cell density as determined by their depth
on Percoll-Renografin gradients. The original division into
four fractions was guided by the observation that most sickle
cell patients have a bimodal distribution of cells on density
gradients. One major population consists of cells with a den￾sity similar to that of AA cells (fraction II); the other major
population is very dense (fraction IV) and contains mainly
ISC (Table I). The cells lighter than fraction II (fraction I)
contain a high population of reticulocytes (Table I). The
fraction between II and IV is called fraction III and the
characteristics of this fraction are described in this paper.
The choice of four fractions was guided by the desire to
define fractions that have a morphologically dominant spe￾cies and are easily identifiable on inspection of the gradient.
Typical cell distributions on Percoll-Renografin gradients are
illustrated in Fig. 1 of reference 1 and characterized in Table
I of this paper.
Some variation (±0.3 cm out of 8 cm) in the depth at
which tubes are cut occurs from one preparation to the next.
However, these variations should have only a small effect on
the average MCHC of the individual fractions and probably
most of the variation in the average MCHC of each fraction
is the result of the inherent errors (±1.5 g%) in MCHC de￾terminations. The low MCHC of fraction IV for S.M. and
O.E. probably reflects an absence of very dense ISC in these
patients' blood. The leukocytes and platelets were removed
by aspirating the layer that contains these cells with no loss
of reticulocytes, which is a major advantage of density gra￾dient fractionation as opposed to aspirating a buffy coat after
centrifugation. MCHC was measured using handspun Hct
and Drabkin's reagent. Reticulocytes were stained by meth￾ylene blue and ISC counts were made in the neutral formalin
(10%)-fixed cells.
For rheologic and hemodynamic studies, complete re￾moval of the leukocytes and platelets from fraction I (top)
and unfractionated blood was verified by microscopic ex￾amination of stained smears. All the samples were washed
three times in Ringer's solution of either bicarbonate (154.3
mM NaCl, 5.63 mM KCI, 2.16 mM CaCl2, and 0.6 mM MgCl2
or nonbicarbonate (118 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCI, 27 mM
NaHCO3, 2.5 mM CaC12, 0.6 mM MgCl2) composition, each
containing 0.5 or 1% bovine albumin. The pH of bicarbonate
Ringer's solution was adjusted to 7.4 by equilibration with
gas mixtures containing 5.6% CO2. The pH of nonbicarbon￾ate Ringer's was adjusted by NaOH or HCI (0.05 M each).
The osmolarity of these solutions was adjusted to 295-300
mosmol with the use of a Microosmette (Precision Systems,
Inc., Sudbury, MA). The use of Ringer's solution of either
composition yielded the same results in viscosity and he￾modynamic measurements. Samples were deoxygenated by
alternate application of a moderate vacuum and water-sat￾urated nitrogen and were rotated to ensure a large surface
area for gas exchange. The percentage of oxy, carbon mon￾oxy, and methemoglobin present in the samples were de￾termined with the use of a Instrumentation Laboratory Co￾oximeter model 282 (Instrumentation Laboratory, Inc., Lex￾ington, MA).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were
fixed in 3% gluteraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline pH
7.35 and layered on glass coverslides coated with 0.1% poly￾L-lysine hydrobromide type VI (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO) before dehydration. Series of increasing ethanol
concentration followed by Freon 113 were used for the de￾hydration. Freon 13 was used as transitional fluid for critical
point drying (Bomar SPC-900/EX: The Bomar Co., Tacoma,
WA) and gold sputtering for coating time (EMS-41 Mini￾coater Film-Vac, Inc., Englewood, NJ). Samples were ex￾amined on a mini scanning electron microscope (Interna￾tional Scientific Instruments, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).
Viscosimetry. Viscosity measurements were made at
37°C on oxygenated and deoxygenated erythrocyte suspen￾sions in Ringer's containing 0.5% bovine albumin at a Hct
of 30%. A Wells-Brookfield microcone-plate viscosimeter
(model LVT, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, Inc.,
Stoughton, MA) was used. Calibration of cone and cup was
done frequently using a silicone oil standard (viscosity-5 cen￾tipose, cP). Each time 1.10 ml of sample was pipetted into
the center of the cup and viscosity measurements were taken
in duplicate at shear rates ranging from 11.5 to 230 s-'.
During the study of deoxygenated samples, the cone-plate

chamber was gassed with N2 via the gas inlet. The mean
percent hemoglobin oxygen saturation (±SD) value (HbO2)
for deoxygenated fractions and unseparated cells were
4.1±2.0 (I), 11.7±2.6 (II), 12.8±3.3 (III), 12.2±3.1 (IV), and
8.2±1.0 (unseparated). Samples taken before and after vis￾cosimetric measurements showed <1% change in oxygen sat￾uration.
Hemodynamic studies. These studies were performed in
an isolated, acutely denervated, artificially perfused rat me￾soappendix vasculature. Isolation, perfusion, and mainte￾nance of the tissue and microvasculature were done by the
method of Baez (3, 5). Briefly, in anesthetized (sodium pen￾tabarbitol 30 mg/kg) rats of the Wistar strain, 120-150 g,
the right ileocolic artery and vein were cannulated with
heparinized (100 ul/ml) silastic tubing at a site 3 cm distant
from the ileocolic junction. Under a steady-state perfusion
with Ringer's containing 1% bovine albumin, the ascending
colon and terminal ileum (3 cm each) were sectioned be￾tween ties. After hemostatic ties of all vascular connections
was achieved, the tissue was isolated. The isolated mesoap￾pendix was gently spread on an optically clear lucite block
on a special microscope stage. The entire preparation was
covered with a plastic Saran wrap or, when required, en￾closed in a plastic capsule, except for outlets of cannulas and
the microscope objective.
The control arterial perfusion pressure (Ppa) and venous
outflow pressures (Pv) were kept constant at 80 and 3.8
mmHg, respectively, and monitored via Statham-Gould P￾50 pressure transducers (Statham Instruments, Inc., Oxnard,
CA). The venous outflow (Fv) rate was monitored using a
photoelectric dropcounter and expressed in milliliters per
minute. A lapse of 10-12 min was allowed for tissue equil￾ibration and stabilization of Fv. Only preparations exhibiting
mesoappendix microvasculature free of host blood cells and
with a steady Fv of 4.6±0.5 (mean±SD) were used. The
experiments were done at 370C. After control measurements
of Ppa and Fv, oxygenated or deoxygenated gradient frac￾tion samples (0.2 ml; Hct 30%) were gently delivered via an
injection port, 15 cm distal to site of arterial cannulation,
and the changes in Ppa and Fv were recorded on the strip
chart of a Grass polygraph (Grass Instrument Co., Quincy,
MA). The tissue preparations were perfused for 10-15 min
before the infusion of samples with Ringer's solution to allow
stabilization of the tissue and clear the vasculature of the
remaining blood cells of the host animal. Each mesoappendix
and tissue vasculature preparation was sufficient for the eval￾uation of four to five samples. The resulting obstruction after
the infusion of deoxygenated SS cells was cleared and the
flow restored, in most instances, by briefly (2-3 min) per￾fusing the vasculature with fully oxygenated Ringer's solu￾tion at high pressure (100 mmHg). The mean percent HbO2
(±SD) in deoxygenated samples (fraction I-IV and unsep￾arated cells) was as follows: 14.0±4.9 (I), 18.1±4.1 (II),
18.8±4.1 (III), 18.0±2.6 (IV), and 17.8±5.2 (unseparated).
In selected infusions (n = 4) determination of HbO2% made
before and after the passage of deoxygenated samples
showed mean values of 18.4±5.2 (arterial) and 23.8±6.0
(venous). The slight increase in the percent oxygenation on
the venous side occurred because the sealed capsule con￾tained atmospheric levels of oxygen to maintain tissue via￾bility. At the end of each experiment the entire tissue prep￾aration (free of cannules and luminal content) was weighed.
Peripheral resistance units (PRU) were calculated as previ￾ously described (6) and expressed as PRU = AP/Q = mmHg/
ml per min per g; where AP (mmHg) is the arteriovenous
pressure difference and Q (ml/min per g) is the rate of ve￾nous outflow per gram of the tissue.
In each experiment, pressure-flow recovery time (Tpf) was
determined following the bolus infusion of samples. Tpf is
defined as the time (seconds) required for Ppa and Fv to
return to their base-line levels following the delivery of a
given sample, and it represents total transit time throughout
the mesoappendix vasculature.
Perfusion of the isolated vasculature with Ringer's solution
(1% albumin) did not result in any visible changes in the
morphological characteristics of the vascular endothelium as
seen by scanning as well as transmission electron microscopy
of randomly chosen tissue samples.2
RESULTS
SEM
When SS whole blood is separated on a Percoll-Ren￾ografin density gradient, four distinct fractions, each
with characteristic morphological features, can be iso￾lated (Table I, Fig. 1). Fraction I has a large percentage
of reticulocytes; in the oxygenated state, many of these
cells appear lobulated while others appear flat and
ovalocytic. Interestingly, when the count of lobulated
cells by SEM is compared with the count of reticulocyte
by supravital stain in the same aliquot, it appears that
erythrocyte retaining reticulum can be of either the
lobulated or flat ovalocytic shape. This observation is
in complete agreement with the findings of Coulombel
et al. (7). In addition, a very small percentage of cells
in this fraction appear to be morphologically ISC. In
each patient, the percent reticulocytes recovered in
fraction I is related to the total count in the unfrac￾tionated samples. Fraction II is composed mainly of
cells of discocyte morphology in the oxygenated state
or reversibly sickled cells (RSC) but also has a variable
but small number of reticulocytes and ISC. Fraction
III are mainly dense discocytes, in the oxygenated state,
with some ISC. The bottom fraction IV is comprised
mainly of dense ISC (60-85%) with an average MCHC
in the group of patients studied in the range of 41.2-
47.0 g/dl. Following deoxygenation, typical sickle
forms are seen in fraction I and II. Although we have
not observed dynamic morphological aspects of sick￾ling, the multilobulated reticulocytes of fraction I ap￾pear to assume multispiculated forms (Fig. 1) rather
than a typical sickle shape. The dense discocytes of
fraction III show minimal transformation, displaying
only tiny spicules projected from a more or less circular
morphology, while no significant changes are observed
in the ISC-rich fraction (IV), which also contains the
densest discocytes.
Of six patients studied, five had fraction II as the
predominant component; the percentage of total cells
recovered in this fraction ranged from 42 to 65. Only
in one case (V.S.) were fraction I and IV larger than

others. Analysis of unseparated blood of this patient
revealed a smaller discocyte population but high counts
of reticulocytes (35%) and ISC (46%).
Viscosimetric observations
Oxygenated fractions. Viscosimetry (shear rate,
230 s-1) of the isolated oxygenated fractions (I-IV) of
six patients at matching Hct (30%) establishes that each
fraction has different rheologic characteristics (Fig. 2).
Fraction II, composed mainly of discocytes, is the least
viscous of all the fractions and its bulk viscosity is com￾parable to that of unseparated AA samples. Of special
interest is the elevated bulk viscosity of fraction I in
each case over that of fraction II in spite of lower
MCHC in the former. At the shear rate of 230 s-', the
difference between the viscosity of fraction I and II are
significant but at a P < 0.05. However, a strong cor￾relation was evident between fraction I viscosity values
of each patient and the percent reticulocytes present
in the same samples (y = 2.1299 + 0.006x,
r = 0.89). The lowest viscosity of 2.2 cP was obtained
for a fraction I sample (D.L.) containing 13% reticu￾locytes, while another sample (V.S.) with highest per￾cent of reticulocytes (64%) was also the most viscous
(2.68 cP). The elevated MCHC and presence of ISC
in fraction III are responsible for its higher viscosity
than that of fraction I and II. Fraction IV, with its
preponderance of ISC and consequently high density
(MCHC) is signifcantly most viscous at all shear rates.
Individual samples from fraction III-IV revealed an
excellent correlation (y = 2.467 + 0.0088x, r = 0.84)
between bulk viscosity (2.40-3.40 cP) and percent ISC
(13-84%). The viscosities of unseparated samples fall
in between those of fraction I and II. Clearly, these
values reflect a balance between various subpopulations
and cannot, in any simple way, be predicted from the
varied percentages of rheologically different subclasses
of cells. In this context, it may be of significance to
note that whole blood MCHC values in different in￾dividuals are strikingly similar (36.01±0.5 g/dl) despite
significant differences in how the cells were appor￾tioned among the four subpopulations.
Deoxygenated fractions. Deoxygenation of isolated
fractions (I-IV) results in almost twofold increase in
bulk viscosity over the respective oxy values at the
shear rate used (Figs. 2 and 5). It appears that the
viscosity of deoxygenated fractions is linearly depen￾dent on MCHC. At the comparable deoxy levels the
least dense fraction (I) is also the least viscous, while
the maximum viscosity is obtained for fraction IV. The
viscosities of the unseparated samples fall in between
those of fractions III and IV. The °2 partial pressure
at which 50% of hemoglobin is oxygenated (P50) of
sickle cells increases with MCHC (1), which means
that there is no simple relation between deoxy whole
blood viscosities and the deoxy viscosities of the in￾dividual fractions. This is because the viscosity of the
SS cell is sensitive to the degree of deoxygenation and
in unseparated samples the discocytes will have a
higher percentage of oxyhemoglobin than the ISC be￾cause of the difference in P50.
Hemodynamic observations
In each case the isolated vasculature is first perfused
with Ringer's solution (cont'rol) at a constant Ppa of 80
mmHg to be followed by a bolus infusion of a given
cell sample (oxy or deoxy). The resulting changes
(Ringer's solution vs. cells) in hemodynamic parame￾ters (Ppa and Fv) are determined along with Tpf for
each fraction (Table II). Fig. 3 is representative poly￾graph recordings of hemodynamic responses of the
mesoappendix vasculature to the bolus infusion of oxy
and deoxy cells from each fraction of a single patient
(O.E.). The percent changes in the calculated periph￾eral resistance (PRU) for cells as compared with the
control (Ringer's) values reveal different flow charac￾teristics for each density gradient fraction (Fig. 4).

microvasculature. The calculated mean PRU shows
only a slight increment (6.9%) over the control (Ringer's)
value. In each case the infusion of fraction I cells results
in higher PRU (mean 14.6%). Tpf (Table II) shows an
increase for fraction I as compared with that for frac￾tion II. Tpf for fraction II is closer to that for unsep￾arated AA cells than for unseparated SS cells. The per￾cent changes in PRU with the infusion of fraction III
cells (dense discocytes) are closer to that observed with
fraction II than with fraction I. However, the passage
of fraction III cells through the isolated vasculature is
somewhat prolonged as demonstrated by an extended
Tpf. When the calculated changes in PRU and Tpf for
each oxy fraction are compared for each patient, the
flow behavior of fraction II is found to be most normal
and that of ISC-rich fraction IV the least.
Deoxygenated fractions. The resulting changes in
Ppa and Fv following the infusion of cells from deoxy
fractions become successively more pronounced from
fraction I to IV (Table II). Consequently, PRU for frac￾tion I, II, III, and IV increases linearly (Figs. 3 and 4).
In contrast to the nearly uniform rise (about twofold)
in viscosity recorded for each fraction following deox￾ygenation, the ratios of deoxy to oxy PRU (percent) for
fraction I-IV clearly demonstrate the profound adverse
influence of deoxygenation on the flow behavior of cells
from dense fractions (III and IV) in the isolated mi￾crovascular preparation (Fig. 5). Fraction I results in
about twofold increase in PRU (percent) over the oxy
value (Fig. 5). The change in calculated mean PRU
(percent) for deoxy fraction II is about fivefold greater
than the mean oxy PRU value, due to the particularly
low PRU values observed in the oxygenated condition
for this fraction. Significantly, fraction III exhibits

maximum rise in PRU with deoxygenation that is more
than 10-fold over that of its oxy counterpart. Fraction
IV shows a similarly large effect (more than eightfold)
upon deoxygenation. Only partial recovery of pressure
and flow is seen following the infusion of deoxy sam￾ples, which indicates persistent microvascular obstruc￾tion. The PRU values for the unseparated samples lie
between those for fraction II and fraction III. Again
the difference in P50 for the various fractions makes the
comparison of PRU values for the unseparated samples
with those of the individual fractions a complex but
not unapproachable problem.
DISCUSSION
The differences reported here in the rheologic and
hemodynamic characteristics of four different eryth￾rocyte fractions (as defined by gradient separation)
have pathophysiological significance due to the marked
density heterogeneity of erythrocytes in the blood of
sickle cell patients. The heterogeneity of erythrocyte

FIGURE 5 Representation of the ratios of oxy and deoxy
values (PRU [A] and viscosity [0]) of each gradient fraction
(I-IV) and unseparated SS cells. Nearly uniform increase
(about twofold) in viscosity is recorded upon deoxygenation
of each fraction and unseparated cells. In contrast, in the
isolated vasculature, infusion of deoxy cell populations re￾sults in varying degree of increases in PRU over their oxy
counterparts. The changes in the ratios of oxy and deoxy
PRU (percent) are most dramatic for fraction III (dense dis￾cocytes) and IV (ISC), which demonstrates profound va￾soocclusive behavior of dense cell classes with deoxygena￾tion.
density has been previously reported by Fabry and
Nagel (1) and is in accordance with observations of
Clark et al. (2). In addition to this heterogeneity in the
density distribution within each patient, Fabry and
Nagel (1) have detected a marked patient-to-patient
variation in the extent in which each range of density
is populated by erythrocytes.
The results depicted in Fig. 2 demonstrate signifi￾cant differences in bulk viscosity (at a shear rate of
230 s-1) between the four fractions in the oxygenated
state. Moreover, the bulk viscosity almost uniformly
doubles in each fraction following deoxygenation (Fig.
5). In other words, the deoxy-oxy viscosity difference
first perfused with oxy or deoxy Ringer's solution at Ppa of 80 mmHg, which is followed by
a bolus infusion of a given fraction (0.2 ml, Hct 30, vertical arrows). The changes in Ppa and
Fv are recorded and the peripheral resistance calculated. Oxygenated fractions (left): Fraction
I results in larger increases in Ppa decrease in Fv as compared with that observed for fraction
II cells. Though fraction III resulted in smaller increase in PRU, the Ppa-Fv recovery time is
prolonged as compared with that observed for fraction I and II. The passage of ISC-rich fraction
IV results in higher PRU (15%) and there is delayed recovery of Ppa and Fv. Deoxygenated
fractions (right): There is a progressive increase in PRU for fraction I-IV. Fraction I and II, respectively, result in 29.6 and 36.4% rise in PRU. On the other hand, dense discocytes (fraction
III) and ISC (fraction IV) cause a much pronounced rise in percent PRU, i.e., 86.5 and 138%,
respectively. In each case there is only partial recovery of Ppa and Fv.

remains constant in fraction II, III, and IV. A different
picture emerges from the Baez preparation: the frac￾tions also exhibit differences in peripheral resistance
in the oxygenated state but more significantly, a dra￾matic progressive increase in their differences in the
deoxygenated state (Fig. 4). Consequently, the deoxy￾oxy differences increase progressively in fractions II,
III, and IV (Fig. 5). This finding demonstrates that
bulk viscosity of deoxygenated sickle erythrocytes at
high shear rate is sensitive to the presence of poly￾merized Hb S but not very sensitive to changes in the
amount of intracellular polymer formed, since it has
been well established (8) that the size of the polymer
phase increases drastically with increasing MCHC. On
the other hand, in the Baez preparation, the peripheral
resistance of deoxy cells exhibit progressive increases
with erythrocyte density (MCHC) and consequently
with the amount of the polymer phase. This is in ac￾cordance with the major contribution of the cytosol
viscoelastic properties on erythrocyte deformability
(9). These results should discourage the attempt to
derive pathophysiological conclusions in sickle cell
anemia from bulk viscosity data alone.
It is the pronounced increases in the peripheral re￾sistance of deoxygenated cells from fractions III (dense
discocytes) and IV (ISC and some very dense disco￾cytes), which suggests that the patient-to-patient dis￾tribution of cells among the four density classes may
be significant in the pathophysiology of the disease.
This is the first time that it has been demonstrated
that the dense discocytes (fraction III) may pose a se￾vere challenge to flow in the microcirculation. This
hitherto unrecognized fraction, is formed by those cells
that are morphologically discoid, but have an inher￾ently elevated MCHC. Even under oxygenated con￾ditions these cells induce a prolonged Tpf. The pro￾nounced increase in PRU of deoxygenated fraction III
cells demonstrates the greatly enhanced vasoocclusive
behavior of these cells as compared with fraction I and
II cells that have a lower MCHC. SEM of oxy and
deoxy cells from the four classes (Fig. 1) offers insight
into the possible origin of the effects of fraction III
cells on the microcirculation. It is well known that
following deoxygenation most discoid cells (from frac￾tion I and II) assume characteristic sickled shapes and
that ISC (fraction IV) remain unchanged (11). Signif￾icantly, the dense discocytes of fraction III, like ISC,
undergo minimal shape change on deoxygenation
which suggests that they are converted to rigid disk￾shaped cells. Thus, this study provides evidence that
in the whole blood of sickle cell patients there are two
functionally different classes of discocytes. Earlier
studies of Clark et al. (10) have shown that in vitro
(nystatin-sucrose-induced) dehydration of HbS disco￾cytes before deoxygenation results in retention of dis￾coid morphology after deoxygenation. We observe that
dehydrated discocytes occur in whole sickle blood and
that they cause pronounced hemodynamic changes in
the isolated vasculature; this suggests a significant role
for these cells in the vasoocclusive phenomena.
The question arises then, why are dense discocytes
(fraction III) particularly incompetent in traversing
the microcirculatory bed in the Baez preparation. One
hypothesis, that deserves consideration, is that the
shape of the dense discocyte might represent a bigger
obstacle to capillary flow than the elongated ISC. Per￾tinent to this is the observation of La Celle (11) that
deoxygenated ISC once in the capillary microcircu￾lation of mice orient themselves along the vessel axis,
posing no significant problem to the capillary flow.
Hence, the ISC-induced obstruction occurs mainly at
the junction of precapillary arterioles and true capil￾laries (11-14). We hypothesize that dense discocytes
might, in fact, reach the capillaries more frequently
(as they are less likely to be stopped in the junction
point) but once deoxygenated would fail to deform
appropriately for the requirements of flow, thus re￾sulting in an effective capillary blockage. We are in
the process of experimentally testing this hypothesis.
The similarity of the effects of fraction III and frac￾tion IV on the hemodynamic characteristics studied
might partly explain the persistent controversy that
exists (15, 16) over the contribution of morphologically
defined ISC in the clinical severity of the disease.
The results presented here also demonstrate that
each fraction has distinctive viscosity and hemody￾namic characteristics even under oxygenated condi￾tions. The present observations on the viscosity char￾acteristics of discocytes and ISC are in complete agree￾ment with those of Chien et al. (17) and Murphy et
al. (18). The reticulocyte-rich fraction I shows in￾creased viscosity as well as PRU over those observed
for fraction II, which behaves more like AA cells. Re￾duced deformability of reticulocytes in sickle cell and
other hemolytic anemias has been noted earlier using
micropipette and nucleopore filtration techniques (19-
21) and interpreted as a consequence of lobulated
shape of immature reticulocytes (19) or increased ri￾gidity of the reticulocyte membrane (20). It should be
recognized, however, that this increase in rigidity does
not necessarily imply a change in the reticulocytes
membrane intrinsic material properties, as the effect
could be derived exclusively from extrinsic (shape)
factors contributing to deformability (9, 22); a cor￾rugated sheet of metal is more rigid than a flat sheet
of the same material.
When deoxygenated, the rheological and hemody￾namic characteristics of fraction I are governed by the
changes in intracellular viscosity rather than the shape
and the effects of low reticulocyte MCHC become ap￾30 D. K. Kaul, M. E. Fabry, P. Windisch, S. Baez, and R. L. Nagel

parent. Therefore, the suggestion of Leblond and Cou￾lombe (21) that reticulocytosis may significantly affect
the flow characteristics of the whole blood in hemolytic
anemias, is only relevant to the oxygenated condition
in sickle cell anemia. In deoxygenated blood, the re￾ticulocyte is the hemodynamically most competent
erythrocyte as it produces the least degree of periph￾eral resistance in the Baez preparation and has the
highest oxygen affinity.
Another interesting aspect to be kept in mind, is that
antisickling agents might differentially affect each cat￾egory of cells, and that a substance effective in inter￾fering with polymerization might not be capable of
initially reducing the fraction III and IV count.
We can conclude then, that due to the variability
from patient to patient in the distribution of cells in
the four categories defined by density gradients, the
pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia might vary con￾siderably among affected individuals. Depending on
which fraction predominates, or which fraction is rep￾resented over a critical threshold, the sequences of
events in the microcirculation might be different (pre￾capillary or intracapillary plugging, for example). Fu￾ture work will be needed to define the exact nature
of these events and their relation with the clinical
course of sickle cell anemia.
