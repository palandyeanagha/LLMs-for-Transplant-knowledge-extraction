Abstract
Objectives The aetiology and burden of viral-induced 
acute liver failure remains unclear globally. It is important 
to understand the epidemiology of viral-induced ALF to 
plan for clinical case management and case prevention.
Participants This systematic review was conducted to 
synthesize data on the relative contribution of different 
viruses to the aetiology of viral-induced acute liver failure 
in an attempt to compile evidence that is currently missing 
in the field. EBSCOhost, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus 
and Web of Science were searched for relevant literature 
published from 2009 to 2019. The initial search was run 
on 9 April 2019 and updated via PubMed on 30 September 
2019 with no new eligible studies to include. Twenty-five 
eligible studies were included in the results of this review.
Results This systematic review estimated the burden 
of acute liver failure after infection with hepatitis B virus, 
hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis E virus, herpes 
simplex virus/human herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, 
Epstein-Barr virus and parvovirus B19. Data were largely 
missing for acute liver failure after infection with varicella￾zostervirus, human parainfluenza viruses, yellow fever 
virus, coxsackievirus and/or adenovirus. The prevalence of 
hepatitis A-induced acute liver failur was markedly lower 
in countries with routine hepatitis A immunisation versus 
no routine hepatitis A immunisation. Hepatitis E virus was 
the most common aetiological cause of viral-induced 
acute liver failure reported in this review. In addition, viral￾induced acute liver failure had poor outcomes as indicated 
by high fatality rates, which appear to increase with poor 
economic status of the studied countries.
Conclusions Immunisation against hepatitis A and 
hepatitis B should be prioritised in low-income and 
middle-income countries to prevent high viral-induced 
acute liver failure mortality rates, especially in settings 
where resources for managing acute liver failure are 
lacking. The expanded use of hepatitis E immunisation 
should be explored as hepatitis E virus was the most 
common cause of acute liver failure.
Registration PROSPERO registration number: 
CRD42017079730.
Background
Acute liver failure (ALF) refers to the devel￾opment of encephalopathy and synthetic 
function impairment after acute liver injury 
in an individual without pre-existing liver 
disease.1
 The presence of encephalopathy 
is not required to define ALF in paediatric 
cases, but is an essential component of the 
definition of ALF in adults.1
 Possible causes 
of ALF include viral infections, drugs and 
toxins, pregnancy-related liver diseases, 
vascular causes and/or malignancies. Acute 
viral hepatitis has been identified as the most 
common cause of ALF among all ages in Asia 
and Africa and one of the most common 
causes of ALF in children in Asia and South 
America.1 2 The incidence of viral-induced 
ALF has substantially declined in Europe after 
the introduction of universal immunisation 
against the hepatitis B virus (HBV), with only 
19% of all ALF cases now attributable to viral 
infection in the European population.3
 The 
introduction of routine immunisation against 
the hepatitis A virus (HAV) in Argentina has 
reduced the number of hepatitis A-induced 
ALF cases by more than 25%.3
Fatality rates associated with ALF vary 
between 60% and 80% depending on the 
disease aetiology as well as a patient’s access 
Strengths and limitations of this study
► Comprehensive and exhaustive search for relevant 
studies from several databases.
► Comprehensive diagnostic inclusion criteria for 
acute liver failure cases according to international 
guideline.
► Lack of language restrictions in search led to inclu￾sion of geographically diverse data.
► Findings limited by lack of data for some of the viral 
aetiologies of acute liver failure which may have led 
to an underestimation of the global burden of viral￾induced acute liver failure.
► Diversity of viruses attributable to acute liver fail￾ure cases and viral detection methods led to high 
heterogeneity and low statistical power in meta￾analyses conducted.

to care.4 5 Liver transplantation plays a central role in 
the management of ALF and remains the only definitive 
treatment for patients who fail to demonstrate sponta￾neous recovery.
6
 A large proportion of patients with ALF 
in both high and low resource settings, however, are 
deemed to have contraindications to transplantation or 
deteriorate beyond transplantation before a liver donor 
is found.7–9
The burden of viral-induced ALF around the world
still remains unclear, with little to no data collected 
regarding the disease incidence.1
 Establishing the aeti￾ology of viral-induced ALF is important for early initia￾tion of treatment, determining the prognosis of the liver 
failure and identifying potential contraindications to 
liver transplantation. Most importantly, understanding 
the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable aetiologies of
ALF should be prioritised in under-resourced regions
with limited access to facilities for transplantation. This 
review aims to synthesise data on the relative contribu￾tion of different viruses to the aetiology of viral-induced
ALF in an attempt to compile evidence that is currently 
missing in the field.
Bernal et al. completed a review of the burden of acute 
liver failure based on literature published between 1997 
and 2009. The review became the bases for guidelines 
for clinical practice.4
 In this systematic review, we assess 
whether data have changed following the Bernal et al.
publication, and whether there is evidence to warrant a 
review of clinical practice.
Objectives
► To estimate the prevalence of hepatitis A virus (HAV), 
hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepa￾titis D virus (HDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), Epstein￾Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1), 
herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV2), varicella-zoster virus

Methods
This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO 
(registration number CRD42017079730) and the review 
methods have been published.10 The results of the review 
are reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines checklist.
Study eligibility criteria
Published cross-sectional, surveillance and cohort studies 
reporting the outcomes of interest in patients with ALF 
after infection with HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV, EBV, 
HSV1, HSV2, VZV, parvovirus B19, HPIVs, YFV, HHV-6, 
CMV, CA16 and/or HAdVs were eligible for inclusion in 
this study. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had 
clearly stated case definitions of viral-induced ALF and 
confirmed ALF cases using both clinical and serological, 
molecular or culture diagnostic methods.
Search strategy
A combination of the following search terms (including 
the use of Medical Subject Headings (MESH)) was used 
and adapted for each of the relevant electronic databases: 
epidemiology, prevalence, incidence, burden, mortality, 
morbidity, fulminant hepatic failure, fulminant liver 
failure, acute hepatic failure, acute liver failure, hepatitis 
A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus 
(HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), 
Epstein Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1), 
herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV2), varicella-zoster virus 
(VZV), parvo-virus B19, human parainfluenza viruses 
(HPIVs), yellow fever virus (YFV), human herpesvirus 6 
(HHV-6), cytomegalovirus (CMV), coxsackievirus and 
adenovirus.
The following electronic databases were searched 
for relevant literature published from 2009 to 2019: 
EBSCOhost, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of 
Science. The search was run on 9 April 2019 and updated 
via PubMed on 30 September 2019 with no new eligible 
studies to include.
Data extraction
Study characteristics and outcomes of interests were 
extracted from the included studies on a predesigned 
data extraction form by two independent reviewers (JP 
and HSH). Prior to use by the two reviewers, the reli￾ability of the extraction form was assessed by piloting 10 
randomly selected articles that met the inclusion criteria. 
The study team resolved any disagreements in data 
extraction through consensus in consultation with RM. 
In cases where studies were in German, HSH provided 
translation. In cases where studies were not available in 
English or German, Google translate was used to translate 
the article to English.11
Data synthesis and analysis
A random-effects model was fitted to the study data as 
it included data taken from a series of independently 
performed studies in different populations. We assessed 
heterogeneity by calculating I2
 statistics (threshold 
I
2
>40%). The values of I2
 were categorised for heteroge￾neity as follows: ‘not important’ (≤40%), ‘moderate’ (﻿‍>
40% to ≤60%) and ‘considerable’ (﻿‍>60% to ≤80%) and 
‘substantial’ (﻿‍>80% to ≤100%). Where ‘not important’ 
or ‘moderate’ heterogeneity existed between studies 
(I2
≤60%), pooled outcome measures were reported with

(I2
>60%), forest plots and prevalence ranges calculated 
using the random-effects model were used to narratively 
describe each outcome.
Risk of bias assessment
Each included study was assessed for risk of bias and quality 
using the Hoy et al tool for observational studies.12 13
Studies were judged as having ‘low risk’ if scored 8–10, 
‘moderate risk’ if scored 5–7 and ‘high risk’ if scored 0–5. 
All risk of bias judgements were made by both JP and 
HSH. In case of disagreement in risk of bias and quality 
assessment, a final decision was made through consensus 
in consultation with RM.
Patient and public involvement
This review was developed as part of an ongoing project 
by the research team that aims to generate evidence to 
facilitate evidence-based decision-making of introducing 
routine hepatitis A vaccination in South Africa. The find￾ings of this review contribute to the knowledge base that 
aims to enhance global vaccination strategies against 
viral-associated ALF. As this is a systematic review, no 
patient involvement was required; however, it is hoped 
that the findings of this review will help to highlight the 
burden that ALF places on populations without routine 
vaccination.
Results
The initial database searches yielded 6952 records, from 
which 3545 duplicates were removed. A further 3263 
were excluded following the screening of titles and 
abstracts (figure 1). The full text of the remaining 144 
records were screened by JP and HSH, from which 25 
studies were deemed to meet the final inclusion criteria. 
Twenty-four (96%) of the included studies were cohort 
studies. As detailed in table 1, the included studies were 
published between 2009 and 2017. Included studies were 
conducted globally, with seven studies and three studies 
conducted in India and Pakistan, respectively. The popu￾lations represented by the included studies spanned all 
age groups and included participants primarily from 
hospital settings. As the data in this review were sourced 
from a variety of countries, age groups and settings, the 
heterogeneity was considerable and/or substantial for all

Methodological quality
Risk of bias scores were assigned by two reviewers (JP and 
HSH) and are described in online supplementary table 
1. Overall, a majority of the included studies were judged 
as having ‘low risk’ of bias. Only one included study was 
judged as having ‘moderate risk’ of bias due to lack of 
clarity around the representativeness of the study popu￾lation to the national population, methods of participant 
selection and methods employed to reduce the likelihood 
of non-response.
Discussion
This systematic review estimated the burden of ALF after 
infection with HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV, HSV/HHV, CMV, 
EBV and parvovirus B19. The prevalence of HAV-induced 
ALF is markedly lower in countries with routine HAV 
immunisation, while HEV was the most common aetio￾logical cause of viral-induced ALF reported in this review. 
In addition, viral-induced ALF had poor outcomes as 
indicated by high fatality rates, which seem to increase 
with poor economic status of the studied countries.
The estimated prevalence of HAV-induced ALF in 
countries with routine HAV immunisation was markedly 
lower than the estimated prevalence in countries without 
routine HAV immunisation. When looking at countries 
with data before and after the introduction of routine 
HAV immunisation, the reduction of HAV-induced ALF 
due to vaccination is further highlighted. The combined 
prevalence of HBV-induced ALF was the same in settings 
with or without universal HBV immunisation. Coun￾tries without universal HBV immunisation programmes 
are likely to have weak healthcare systems; thus, the 
reported prevalence of HBV-induced ALF is assumed to 
be an underestimate of the true burden in these popula￾tions due to weak routine testing and reporting systems. 
Currently, there is one HEV vaccine (Hecolin) licensed in 
China that has shown promise with a high degree of effi￾cacy in preventing HEV genotype IV infection in healthy 
individuals 16–65 years.14 Further exploration of the effi￾cacy of this vaccine for prevention of infection with geno￾types I and II in different populations should be done 
to explore its application in different countries and HEV 
endemicity settings.15
This review estimated the mortality rate for viral￾induced ALF to be approximately 50% in low-income 
and middle-income countries (LMICs) and less than 30% 
in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. 
Previous studies have estimated that mortality rates asso￾ciated with ALF vary between 60% and 80%, depending 
on the disease aetiology as well as a patient’s access to 
care. Our review shows that viral-induced ALF still carries 
a significant mortality, though possibly lower than that 
reported for other ALF aetiologies.4 5 Mortality data 
largely come from hospitals with the capacity to diagnose 
viral-induced ALF, thus deaths outside of the hospital 
system or ALF deaths without virological testing may not 
be captured in these mortality estimates. Liver transplan￾tation is required by approximately 25% of viral-induced 
ALF cases and approximately 18% of viral-induced ALF 
cases required renal transplantation, globally. In addition 
to general lack of resources for transplantation, a signifi￾cant proportion of potential candidates have contraindi￾cations to transplant related to poor socioeconomic status 
in LMICs. The transplant data included in this review

may only reflect successful and unsuccessful transplants, 
not those that were needed but not carried out due to 
resource constraints or contraindications.
This review is limited by lack of data for some of the 
viral aetiologies of ALF including for VZV, HPIVs, YFV, 
CA16 and/or HAdVs, which may have led to an underes￾timation of the global burden of viral-induced ALF. Addi￾tionally, we believe that our findings underestimate the 
global burden of viral-induced ALF as some important 
causes of ALF (eg, HSV/HHV) are believed to be under￾recognised as they require PCR testing for diagnosis. The 
included studies also used varying methods of virus detec￾tion including serology and molecular tests which further 
added to the heterogeneity in the results of our review. 
This is a well-recognised limitation in studies of ALF where 
diagnostics are often limited by cost in under-resourced 
regions where viral causes of ALF are more prevalent. 
The limited availability of data, including lack of same 
country data on burden of disease before and after intro￾duction of immunisation, hindered most of the planned 
subgroup analyses outlined in the study protocol. Where 
data were available, high heterogeneity of the data led to 
planned meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses not 
being possible. Lastly, the diversity of viruses attributable 
to ALF cases led to low statistical power in meta-analyses 
conducted.
Future research should assess the burden of viral￾induced ALF after infection with HDV, VZV, HPIVS, YFV, 
CA16 and HAdVs. Collectively, high-quality data on all 
viral aetiologies of ALF would allow for better pooling 
of results. The review team encourages future studies 
to incorporate health economic estimates and math￾ematical modelling where data permit to assist health 
policy decision-makers to better design strategies for 
the prevention and management of viral-induced ALF. 
Epidemiological-economic modelling of immunisation 
against HAV, HBV and HEV may well show that introduc￾tion of vaccination could lead to future cost savings in the 
long run due to prevented medical care and liver failure.
Conclusions
We successfully addressed the aim of the study, although 
data on VZV, HPIVs, YFV, CA16 and/or HAdVs were 
missing. Notwithstanding the noted limitations, it is clear 
that HAV, HBV and HEV—vaccine-preventable ALF aeti￾ologies—account for a large proportion of ALF (approx￾imately 21%, 20%, 32% of viral-induced ALF cases, 
respectively). The burden of ALF that is associated with 
vaccine-preventable ALF aetiologies should be used in 
conjunction with other available key evidence to inform 
practice and policies on immunisation, particularly in 
LMICs. A majority of LMICs have established universal 
vaccination against HBV. The WHO has recently recom￾mended the introduction of an HBV birth dose which is 
aimed at elimination of the virus and, if successful, will 
subsequently reduce the burden of HBV-induced ALF. 
Routine HAV immunisation in LMICs, however, is lacking. 
More data are urgently needed to guide routine use of the 
vaccine in prevention of morbidity and mortality caused 
by the virus. Lastly, further applicability of HEV vaccines 
should be explored, especially in LMICs where resources 
for managing viral-induced ALF are glaringly lacking.
