and type 2 diabetes. In order to clarify the 
pathogenesis of this disease and identify 
potential therapeutic targets, an increased 
understanding of the dynamics of triacyl￾glycerol (TAG) metabolism in the liver in 
relation to whole-body metabolic status is 
needed. Sources of hepatic TAGs include 
dietary TAGs that are transported via 
chylomicrons from the intestine to adi￾pose tissue or to the liver, where they 
are secreted via lipoproteins, in addition 
to TAGs that are synthesized from fatty 
acids and glycerol in the liver. Fatty acids 
required for TAG synthesis are available 
from both the plasma nonesterified fatty 
acid (NEFA) pool and the pool of fatty 
acids newly synthesized within the liver 
through de novo lipogenesis (DNL). TAGs 
present in the liver may be stored as lipid 
droplets or secreted into the blood as 
VLDLs; they may also enter the oxidation 
pathway (Figure 1). The study by Don￾nelly et al. in this issue of the JCI exam￾ines hepatic lipoprotein metabolism in 
humans and describes the major sources 
of hepatic and plasma lipoprotein TAG in 
NAFLD (2).
The NEFA pool
Donnelly et al. found that the plasma 
NEFA pool accounts for approximately 
60% of TAG content in the livers of NAFLD 
patients, which reflects the importance 
of the NEFA pool in the pathogenesis of 
NAFLD (2). The hepatic uptake of fatty 
acids is not regulated and, as a result, 
plasma fatty acid concentration is directly 
related to the influx of fatty acids to the 
liver. The authors report that, in the fasted 
state, adipose tissue contributes approxi￾mately 80% of fatty acid content to the 
plasma NEFA pool, and even in the fed 
state, this contribution remains at approx￾imately 60%. Thus, the overproduction 
of fatty acids in adipose tissues that flow 
to the liver via the NEFA pool is the most 
likely explanation for excess TAG accu￾mulation in NAFLD. In insulin-resistant 
states, insulin does not fully suppress the 
activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, which 
catalyzes the hydrolytic release of fatty 
acids from the TAG moiety and results in 
enhanced lipolysis and flux of fatty acids to 
the plasma NEFA pool (Figure 1). In addi￾Contribution of adipose tissue and de novo 
lipogenesis to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a component of the metabolic 
syndrome, with a clinical spectrum ranging from simple fatty liver to ste￾atohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary event 
of NAFLD is the accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in hepatocytes. 
In this issue of the JCI, Donnelly et al. report on their use of stable iso￾tope methodology to show that fatty acids stored in adipose tissue and fatty 
acids newly made within the liver through de novo lipogenesis are the major 
sources of TAGs in the liver and are secreted as lipoproteins in NAFLD (see 
the related article beginning on page 1343).
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
is the most common cause of abnormal 
results in liver-function tests. This clinical 
situation is really a continuum of diseases 
that includes simple (benign) fatty liver, 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma 
(1). NAFLD is defined as liver steatosis 
in patients who do not consume enough 
alcohol to cause hepatic injury. Although 
some drugs or genetic abnormalities can 
cause NAFLD, the majority of cases are 
associated with obesity, insulin resistance,

tion, reduced glucose uptake due to insu￾lin resistance reduces glycerol-3-phosphate 
levels, thereby reducing the reutilization of 
fatty acids for TAG synthesis (Figure 1). 
Thus, the insulin resistance in adipose tis￾sue is important as a pathogenic factor of 
NAFLD. Recently, dysregulated adipocyto￾kines such as adiponectin and TNF-α have 
been examined as causative candidates of 
insulin resistance (3), and it was recently 
reported that oxidative stress in accumu￾lated fat causes dysregulated adipocytokine 
production (4). In light of these findings, it 
seems possible that the reduction of oxida￾tive stress as well as the use of insulin-sen￾sitizing agents such as thiazolidinediones 
and metformin may prove to be successful 
treatments for NAFLD.
Figure 1
Altered TAG metabolism in NAFLD. Insulin resistance causes insufficient suppression of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activity and reduced 
glucose uptake in adipose tissue, resulting in enhanced lipolysis and increased fatty acid flux into the plasma NEFA pool. In this issue of the JCI, 
Donnelly et al. report that approximately 60% of TAGs accumulated in the liver are derived from the plasma NEFA pool (2). Hyperinsulinemia and 
hyperglucosemia induce SREBP-1c and ChREBP in the liver, respectively. Both of these transcription factors activate most genes required for 
lipogenesis, which enhances DNL in the liver. Approximately 25% of accumulated TAGs in the liver are derived from DNL (2). CM, chylomicron;

Other factors
Mice with peripheral insulin resistance due 
to adipose- and muscle-specific GLUT4 
double knockout showed increased DNL 
accompanied by hepatic elevation of 
SREBP-1c and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
(12). However, in these mice, increased 
DNL did not result in increased TAG level 
in the liver, nor did it increase steady-state 
serum levels of TAGs or NEFAs; this may 
be the result of a compensatory enhance￾ment of peripheral fatty acid usage. Unlike 
in this animal model, such compensation 
is assumed to be insufficient in human 
subjects with type 2 diabetes (13). The 
reduced use of fatty acids in peripheral 
tissues in combination with elevated DNL 
may contribute to TAG accumulation in 
the livers of subjects with NAFLD. Muscle 
exercise is effective in reducing TAG accu￾mulation in the liver not only by improv￾ing insulin resistance but also by enhanc￾ing peripheral fatty acid disposal. 
The accumulation of TAGs in the liver 
results from an imbalance among the 
uptake, synthesis, export, and oxidation 
of fatty acids. In type 2 diabetes, secre￾tion of VLDL is increased due to insulin 
resistance (14). It has been reported, how￾ever, that in NAFLD, VLDL secretion is 
not increased compared with secretion 
in controls (5). Because of methodologi￾cal differences, these results cannot be 
directly compared. Secretion rates of 
hepatic VLDL should be quantified in 
hyperinsulinemic subjects with and with￾out hepatic steatosis. β-oxidation of fatty 
acids in the liver was found to be increased 
in patients with NASH (15). However, the 
increase is not sufficient for overcoming 
elevated rates of hepatic TAG synthe￾sis. The increase in NEFA oxidation may 
account for the apparent oxidative stress 
that causes hepatic injury in NAFLD.
In the study by Donnelly et al. (2), con￾siderable variation was present in liver TAG 
level as well as in the degrees of inflamma￾tion and fibrosis in the liver. In some cases 
of NASH, the amount of accumulated fat 
in the liver decreased as the disease pro￾gressed to cirrhosis (16). In addition, the 
degree of liver damage may influence lipid 
metabolism and apparent insulin sensi￾tivity (15, 17). Thus, to clarify the earliest 
events in TAG accumulation precisely, met￾abolic analysis of patients with simple fatty 
liver (i.e., without hepatitis) is needed.
Donnelly et al. (2) show that the con￾tributions of fatty acid sources of TAG 
in VLDL are almost the same as those for 
the TAG pool in the liver. Although these 
findings result from studies of NAFLD 
patients, the approach used will allow 
us to further investigate this in vivo bio￾chemistry at various stages in the devel￾opment of NAFLD, as well as the effects 
of diet, exercise, and pharmacological 
therapies on the disease.

Contrary to the results reported here, 
Diraison et al. reported that the uptake 
of plasma NEFAs by the liver was not 
increased in NAFLD (5). However, Dirai￾son et al. acknowledged that the rate of 
NEFA flux to the liver may have been 
underestimated due to the entry of plasma 
NEFAs into the liver via portal flow from 
visceral adipose tissue. Thus, in order to 
establish the contribution of NEFAs to 
TAG accumulation in the liver, the actual 
rate of NEFA uptake in the liver in NAFLD 
must be clarified.
De novo lipogenesis
In healthy human subjects, the contri￾bution of DNL in the liver to TAG con￾tent in the fasted state is very small (less 
than 5% for VLDL-TAG) (6). It has been 
reported that DNL in the liver is elevated 
in insulin-resistant states and in NAFLD 
(7). Donnelly et al. found that DNL 
accounted for 26% of liver TAG content in 
hyperinsulinemic subjects with NAFLD 
(2). In healthy subjects, DNL is elevated 
following meals (23% for VLDL-TAG) (6), 
which can be accounted for by elevation 
in the circulating levels of lipogenesis 
precursors. However, in NAFLD, DNL 
was already elevated in the fasted state, 
and further postprandial elevation was 
not observed. Indeed, constant elevation 
of DNL was also observed in subjects fed 
a diet high in simple carbohydrates for 25 
days (8). These observations reflect the 
sustained elevation of enzymes involved 
in hepatic DNL.
The regulation of enzymes involved in 
human lipogenesis can be precisely stud￾ied by experiments in animals. Insulin 
activates the membrane-bound transcrip￾tion factor SREBP-1c, which transcrip￾tionally activates most genes required for 
lipogenesis. In mice, even in the insulin￾resistant state, insulin stimulates hepatic 
SREBP-1c transcription and increases 
lipogenesis (9). Lipogenesis is also regu￾lated by glucose: glucose activates the 
carbohydrate response element–binding 
protein (ChREBP), which induces gene 
expression of liver-type pyruvate kinase, 
a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis; 
this enzyme in turn provides the pre￾cursors for lipogenesis (10). ChREBP 
also stimulates gene expression of most 
enzymes involved in lipogenesis (11). 
Hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia 
may also induce these transcriptional fac￾tors in humans (Figure 1), although this 
remains to be directly demonstrated.

Caffey disease: an unlikely collagenopathy
Francis H. Glorieux
Departments of Surgery, Pediatrics, and Human Genetics, McGill University, and Genetics Unit, Shriners Hospital for Children, Montréal, Quebec, Canada.
Infantile cortical hyperostosis (also known as Caffey disease) is character￾ized by hyperirritability, acute inflammation of soft tissues, and profound 
alterations of the shape and structure of the underlying bones, particularly 
the long bones, mandible, clavicles, or ribs. In this issue of the JCI, Gensure 
et al. undertook fine mapping of the genetic locus for this disease in a large 
kindred of individuals with the autosomal dominant form of the condition. 
The authors found a novel missense mutation in COL1A1, the gene encod￾ing the α1 chain of type I collagen, in all affected individuals in 3 discrete 
pedigrees (see the related article beginning on page 1250). This is a surpris￾ing finding, as all other reported mutations affecting the synthesis of type I 
collagen lead to conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Dan￾los syndrome, in which quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen 
synthesis give rise to bone fragility and/or connective tissue hyperextensi￾bility. The deleterious effect of the mutation on collagen fibril morphology 
is demonstrated; however, the precise functional link between the reported 
missense mutation and the localized inflammation and hyperostosis seen in 
Caffey disease awaits future studies.
Infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH) 
— also referred to as Caffey or Caffey-Sil￾verman disease — was recognized in 1945 
by Caffey and Silverman (1). The condi￾tion, later shown to be transmitted as an 
autosomal dominant trait with incom￾plete penetrance, becomes clinically evi￾dent before 5–7 months of life, and the 
average age at onset is around 9 weeks. 
The initial symptom is general hyperirri￾tability, with fever and anorexia, quickly 
followed by painful, firm soft-tissue 
swelling, particularly in the face (cheeks 
and jaws), the scapular region, and upper 
and lower limbs. It is usually self-lim￾ited, with severe symptoms lasting from 
2–3 weeks to 2–3 months. The pattern of 
distribution of the lesions varies from 
patient to patient and can be symmetri￾cal (Figure 1). Swelling also involves 
underlying muscle. It is important to 
note that this phase of acute inflamma￾tion precedes the abnormal thickening of 
cortical bone (hyperostosis) that gives its 
name to the disease. It also subsides long 
before the hyperostosis resolves. Some￾times lesions recur suddenly in their orig￾inal sites or in new sites, either during or 
after the subsidence of the swellings that 
appeared at the onset of the disease. This 
uneven protracted clinical course with 
unpredictable remissions and relapses is 
one of the most characteristic features of 
the condition (2).
Bone lesions
The radiographic features of ICH evolve 
in stages. Hyperostoses develop on the 
outer cortical surface, expand, and then 
remodel by resorption either at the exter￾nal surface or at the endocortical surface. 
In the latter case, there is an expansion of 
the medullary cavity and the cortex is thin 
(Figure 2B). Epiphyses and metaphyses are 
typically not involved. Tubular bones may 
be grossly deformed (Figure 1), with bony 
bridges sometimes appearing between 
adjacent bones (forearm, ribs). The histol￾ogy of the bone lesions has been described 
in detail (3). Such lesions include not only 
subperiosteal new lamellar bone forma￾tion but also evidence of local inflamma￾tion. Early on, foci of acute inflammation 
are confined in the periosteum; they then 
disrupt the periosteal envelope to blend 
with contiguous tissues (fasciae, muscle, 
and tendon). In the subacute phase, the 
periosteum reestablishes itself as an entity 
with a sheet of fibrous tissue under which 
new subperiosteal bone is formed. In the 
late remodeling stage, signs of inflam￾mation disappear, and excess peripheral 
bone is removed.
Based on these facts, discussion of the 
pathophysiology of ICH naturally turns 
toward a mechanism likely to induce
