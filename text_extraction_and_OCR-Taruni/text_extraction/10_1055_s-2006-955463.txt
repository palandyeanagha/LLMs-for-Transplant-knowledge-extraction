Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia:
A Review
Bruno Girolami, M.D., Ph.D.,1 and Antonio Girolami, M.D.2
ABSTRACT
Immune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a relevant adverse drug
reaction consisting in a hypercoagulable state caused by an anticoagulant agent. The
incidence is 6.5% in patients receiving unfractionated heparin after orthopedic surgery,
and is equal to or lower than 1% in other settings. HIT occurrence is a function of heparin
type, duration of heparin administration, patient population, and gender. The pathogenesis
is due to an antibody response to the complex heparin/platelet factor 4 in most cases, with
secondary activation of platelets and coagulation, and finally increased thrombin gener￾ation. Thrombocytopenia, venous or arterial thrombosis, heparin-induced skin necrosis,
adrenal hemorrhage, and transient amnesia can characterize the clinical course of HIT.
Platelet monitoring in patients receiving heparin is indicated to early detect HIT. A
thrombotic event can be the first manifestation of HIT. Laboratory demonstration of
heparin-dependent platelet activation confirms the clinical diagnosis; antigenic or func￾tional assays are available. Once HIT is highly likely or confirmed serologically, immediate
heparin cessation is mandatory and an alternative therapeutic anticoagulant is needed due
to the high risk (or the presence) of thrombotic events. The available nonheparin
anticoagulants aim to reduce thrombin generation. Lepirudin, argatroban, and bivalirudin
(direct thrombin inhibitors) and danaparoid and fondaparinux (factor Xa inhibitors)
represent the current treatment options for HIT. Vitamin K antagonists can be used safely
only after a stable platelet count has been obtained.
KEYWORDS: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, heparin therapy, review
Of the two identified forms of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT; Table 1), the immune type
(HIT type 2) represents a relevant adverse drug reaction.
Although HIT type has a benign course, with platelet
counts recovering without heparin withdrawal and no
clinical consequences, HIT type constitutes a clinical–
pathological syndrome with a strong association with
thrombotic events. Immediate heparin withdrawal is
required, and in most cases, an alternative anticoagulant
must be administered.1,2
HIT type 2, the object of this review, can be defined
as an unexplained thrombocytopenia of 50% or more
compared with any previous value during exposure to
unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH),3 confirmed by the demonstration of
specific antibodies against the heparin–platelet factor 4
(PF4) complex by means of a functional and/or antigenic
assay.4,5 In this article, we will refer to HIT type 2 simply
as HIT.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The reported frequencies of HIT vary widely. In a review
of prospective trials, the reported estimates ranged from

1 to 30% among patients receiving UFH and 2% in
patients receiving LMWH.6 In a more rigorous review,
the estimated incidence was lower than 3% with UFH,
and 0% with LMWH.6a Considering only prospective
studies in which an appropriate definition of HIT is
present (50% platelet count decrease or thrombotic event
with a positive antibody assay or satisfactory clinical
criteria for HIT), the frequency of HIT results as
reported in Table 2, according to different patient
populations and different heparin compounds. HIT is
more frequent in patients who have had orthopedic
surgery3,7–10 (up to 6.5% when receiving UFH), and is
equal to or lower than 1% in other settings.11–18 Notably,
LMWHs are not free of risk in terms of HIT compared
with UFH. HIT occurrence is a function of heparin type
(bovine UFH > porcine UFH > LMWH), duration of
heparin administration (higher risk from days 5 to 14),
gender (female > male),2 HIT definition, and type of
test used for detecting heparin-dependent antibodies.11
In general, antibodies are more likely to form in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery than orthopedic surgery, as
well as in orthopedic surgery patients who receive UFH
instead of LMWH. However, among patients in whom
antibodies do form, orthopedic patients are much more
likely to develop HIT.11
PATHOGENESIS
Heparin administration can trigger an antibody re￾sponse, given that antibodies are produced against the
heparin–PF4 complex19–22 in some patients,11 depend￾ing on heparin molecular weight.23 PF4 is the most
important antigen,14 but the neutrophil-activating pep￾tide 2 and interleukin 8 may also be involved.24 After
heparin binds to PF4, a conformational change within
PF4 determines the exposition of epitopes,25,26 and
immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, or IgG antibodies are
produced consequently. Clinically, only the IgG class
antibodies are pathogenic27 and associated with throm￾bosis. The heparin–PF4–antibody complex binds to the
platelet surface FcgRIIa receptor.19,28 Cross-linking of
FcgRIIa results in activation of platelets and the coag￾ulation cascade with thrombin generation (a potent
platelet activator). Because additional PF4 is released, a
positive-feedback loop enhances the process.29 Activated
platelets aggregate and are removed prematurely from
the circulation, leading to thrombocytopenia and, in
some patients, to venous or arterial thrombosis. In
summary, HIT pathogenesis can be described as a
three-step process: first, the antibodies are generated
(immune response); second, platelets are activated and
thrombin generation is increased (hypercoagulable
state); third, in some unpredictable patients, thrombosis
occurs (clinical–pathological syndrome).
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Thrombocytopenia typically occurs 5 to 10 days after
initiation of heparin.1 However, in the particular case of
an early re-exposure to heparin in patients who developed

anti-PF4–heparin antibodies in the previous 100 days,
onset may be earlier and rapid.30 In general, an onset of
thrombocytopenia after 2 weeks is unusual. However, a
delayed onset of HIT also has been described31 in which
thrombocytopenia developed after heparin withdrawal.
In general, thrombocytopenia rarely is severe, with
median nadir platelet counts of 60  109
/L32 and it is
rarely associated with bleeding.
Thrombosis, venous and/or arterial, is the major
clinical problem associated with HIT. The prothrom￾botic state associated with HIT is due to thrombin
generation, platelet activation, and endothelial cell acti￾vation.33 The frequency of venous thrombosis in HIT
patients reaches 90% in patients after orthopedic surgery,
whereas arterial thrombosis occurs less frequently.
Approximately one half of patients with HIT are
recognized only after the occurrence of a complicating
thrombotic event. The risk of thrombosis after HIT is
higher than 50% in the first 30 days.34 Deep vein
thrombosis and (fatal) pulmonary embolism are the
most relevant thrombotic events in HIT patients. Other
thrombotic manifestations include venous limb gangrene,
cerebral sinus thrombosis, and upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis can lead to stroke,
myocardial infarction, limb ischemia from peripheral
arterial occlusion, and bowel or kidney infarction. Hep￾arin-induced skin necrosis may occur in fat-rich areas or
in distal extremities and the nose; erythema is followed by
purpura and hemorrhage, leading to necrosis. Other
unusual complications of HIT include adrenal hemor￾rhage and transient global amnesia.35,36
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of HIT initially is clinical. An awareness
of the syndrome is necessary to suggest HIT in cases of
unexplained thrombocytopenia during heparin exposure,
in the case of (new or worsening) thrombosis during
heparin prophylaxis or treatment, or even in the case of
thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after heparin with￾drawal. Furthermore, the assays with the highest sensi￾tivity and specificity are not available in many centers,
and are time consuming and expensive. Clinical scores
have been developed in the past to support the clinical
diagnosis of HIT.4,5 These scoring systems are able to
stratify patients as unlikely, likely, or highly likely to
have HIT, on the basis of several parameters (platelet
decrease, temporal aspects of platelet decrease, platelet
recovery after heparin withdrawal, presence of cutaneous
reactions, or thrombosis or other causes of thrombocy￾topenia). Recently, a pretest probability score has been
developed2 to suggest HIT and it is listed briefly in
Table 3. Early diagnosis is also dependent on the fre￾quency of platelet monitoring. It is recommended to per￾form platelet counts every other day in patients receiving
therapeutic dose of UFH or in postoperative patients
receiving UFH prophylaxis, whereas in medical patients
receiving prophylactic UFH or LMWH, or postoper￾ative patients receiving LMWH prophylaxis, platelet
counts can be performed every 2 or 3 days.1,18
Once a high suspicion of HIT has been formu￾lated, the diagnosis should be confirmed with the dem￾onstration of heparin-dependent platelet activation. The
most specific diagnostic tests for HIT include platelet
aggregation tests, serotonin release assays, heparin-in￾duced platelet aggregation assays, and solid-phase im￾munoassays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
[ELISA]). The main features of the available assays
are listed in Table 4. The serotonin release assay repre￾sents the gold standard of the diagnostic tests for HIT4
and has been validated with a prospective study37; how￾ever, it is costly and requires technical expertise. The

ELISA assay, which has a lower sensitivity (it detects
only IgG/IgM antibodies), should be used in conjunc￾tion with a functional assay. If the two tests are negative,
HIT is ruled out.
TREATMENT
The increased thrombin generation present in HIT is
the target of drug therapy. In fact, available agents aim to
reduce thrombin generation directly (direct thrombin
inhibitors) or by means of factor (F) Xa inhibition
(danaparoid and fondaparinux).1 The evidence support￾ing the use of these drugs comes mainly from prospective
cohort studies (lepirudin and argatroban)38–42 or retro￾spective studies (danaparoid).43–46 Table 5 summarizes
the main features of these compounds. Isolated serocon￾version without thrombocytopenia or thrombosis does
not require any treatment or heparin withdrawal. In
contrast, confirmed HIT without thrombosis (isolated
HIT) requires heparin cessation and an alternative form
of anticoagulation, given that the patients remain at risk
for thrombosis in the short term,34 and heparin with￾drawal alone does not protect these patients from
thrombotic complications. LMWH should be avoided
because of cross-reactivity and risk of induction of
heparin-dependent IgG antibodies. Therapy with non￾heparin anti-FXa or anti-FIIa inhibitors should be
maintained until a stable normal platelet count has
been obtained. Patients with HIT complicated with
thrombosis require an alternative anticoagulant, as do
patients with isolated HIT. Warfarin can be started
safely after platelet counts are normalized. The length
of treatment with warfarin is not well defined, but in
view of the high risk of thrombosis within 30 days of the
diagnosis of HIT, warfarin anticoagulation probably
should be continued for at least 2 to 3 months.1
Table 6 lists the main issues in the management of
patients with HIT, with or without thrombosis.
Lepirudin, recombinant hirudin, is approved in
the United States for treatment of HIT with thrombosis
and is effective in preventing new thromboses in HIT
patients without thrombosis, according to prospective
studies.47 In a prospective cohort of 82 patients with
confirmed HIT, lepirudin led to a rapid platelet count
recovery in 89% of patients and a significant decrease of a
combined end point (death, amputation, and new
thromboembolic events) compared with historical con￾trols (25 versus 52%), with no differences in terms of
bleeding complications.48 Given that the drug is cleared
by the kidneys and no antidote is available, the dosage
of lepirudin needs to be decreased in nephropathic
patients.
Argatroban, a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor,
is approved in the United States for the treatment of
HIT regardless of the presence of thrombosis and during
angioplasty when heparin is contraindicated.1,49 Because
argatroban is metabolized mostly by the liver and ex￾creted in the bile, a lower starting dosage is suggested in
patients with hepatic dysfunction. A pooled analysis of
two prospective cohort studies and a historical control
group showed a significant 14% decrease in the primary
outcome (all-cause death, all-cause amputation, new
thrombosis) in patients with HIT with or without
thrombosis and treated with argatroban.50 The positive
result is due mainly to a decrease in new (venous)
thrombosis. No differences in terms of bleeding were
observed.
Bivalirudin, a recent and promising synthetic
hirudin analogue, has been used in patients with HIT,
but only uncontrolled case series are available. It is

approved in the United States for anticoagulation during
percutaneous coronary interventions.1
Danaparoid, a heparinoid (dermatan sulfate and
low-sulfated heparan sulfate), is used in Europe, Can￾ada, and New Zealand for HIT with or without throm￾bosis,45 and in patients with a history of HIT who
require cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.51 In a non￾randomized comparison study, danaparoid was as effec￾tive as lepirudin in preventing death, amputation, or new
thromboembolic complications with a lower risk of
bleeding.52 Whether the 10% in vitro cross-reactivity
between danaparoid and the antibody responsible for
HIT is of clinical significance is uncertain. No reversing
agent is available.
Fondaparinux has a theoretical role in the treat￾ment and/or prevention of HIT, given that the drug
does not appear to interact with platelets or PF4. Only
case reports on its use in patients with HIT are
available.
To prevent HIT, the following strategies can be
suggested: limit heparin use, avoid bovine UFH, overlap
warfarin as soon as possible to limit heparin exposure,
and use LMWHs, particularly in the orthopedic set￾ting.1 Patients with a history of HIT can be re-exposed
safely to UFH if assays for antibodies are negative; this
generally occurs 100 days after HIT.
