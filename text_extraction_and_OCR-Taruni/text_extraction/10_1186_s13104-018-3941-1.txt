Abstract
Objective: Living donor hepatectomy (LDH) has important consequences in terms of acute and chronic pain. We 
proposed an anesthetic protocol based on the best currently available evidence. We report the results of this proto￾col’s application.
Results: We performed a retrospective descriptive study of 100 consecutive donors undergoing LDH. The protocol 
included standardized information provided by the anesthetist, pharmacological anxiolysis and preventive analgesia. 
Specifically, pregabalin premedication (opioid-free) intravenous anesthesia (with clonidine, ketamine, magnesium 
sulphate and ketorolac) and epidural analgesia were proposed. Postoperative follow-up was conducted by the Post￾operative Pain Service. This analysis included 100 patients (53 women, 47 men, median age 32.7 years old [28.4–37.3]), 
operated by xypho-umbilical laparotomy. All elements of our anesthetic protocol were applied in over 75% of 
patients, except for the preoperative consultation with a senior anesthesiologist (55%). The median number of applied 
item was 7 [interquartile range, IQR 5–7]. Median postoperative pain scores were, at rest and at mobilization respec￾tively 3 [IQR 2–4] and 6 [IQR 4.5–7] on day 1; 2 [IQR 1–3] and 5 [IQR 3–6] on day 2; and 2 [IQR 0–3] and 4 [IQR 3–5] on 
day 3. In conclusion, LDH leads to severe acute pain. Despite the proposal of a multimodal evidence-based protocol, 
its applicancy was not uniform and the pain scores remained relatively high.

Introduction
Living donor hepatectomy (LDH) for related pediatric 
liver transplantation is often associated with significant 
acute and chronic postoperative pain [1–3]. Pain is unde￾sirable and often underestimated in its multi-factorial 
dimensions. Consequences of pain and the treatment of 
pain may be detrimental to postoperative outcome [4] 
and are potentially preventable [4–6].
In 2012, Bonnet et  al. [3] audited postoperative 
pain after this surgery in our institution. The authors 
observed, on the 1st day, that 11% and 37% of the patients 
reported severe postoperative pain (i.e. a score of more 
than 6 out of 10 on an 11-points numeric rating scale 1), 
respectively at rest and at movement. Additionally, the 
patients experiencing persistent pain after surgery pre￾sented higher pain scores than the other, highlighting the 
need for better acute pain management.
Following these results, we aimed to improve the 
quality of postoperative pain management with an evi￾dence-based protocol. Here, we describe this protocol, 
systematically assess the level of evidence for each inter￾vention, and report feasibility (i.e. acceptance) in hun￾dred consecutive donors.

Main text
After ethics committee approval (Number 
017/02JAN/003), Chairperson: Jean-Marie Maloteaux), 
we performed a retrospective study of 100 consecutive 
donors operated between June 2010 and the February 
2014 for LDH. Written informed consent was waived by 
the ethics committee regarding the retrospective nature 
of the study. Criteria for inclusion in the liver donation 
program at our institution are summarized in Table  1. 
For each donor, we retrieved demographic and surgi￾cal characteristics, perioperative anesthetic and analge￾sic regimen, pain scores, clinical and biological (white 
blood/red cell counts, platelets, C-reactive protein, liver 
and renal function, at day +1 and +5) follow-up, length 
of stay, postoperative complications and residual pain 
2 months after the surgery.
Procedures
The perioperative anesthetic and analgesic protocol was 
based on the most recent and highest level of evidence 
with the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine 
(EBM). The first level of evidence (LoE 1) applies to an 
intervention approved by meta-analysis. Those approved 
by Randomized Controlled Trials are considered LoE 2. 
LoE 3 is for non-randomized controlled trials, LoE 4 for 
other studies and LoE 5 for mechanism-based reasoning. 
In the following sections, we detail the LoE for each part 
of the protocol [7, 8].
Preoperative phase
Preoperative information is given by an anesthesiologist 
(PF, with a translator if needed) and includes a patient￾oriented description of the perioperative phases, pro￾cedure, (un)anticipated events, pain expectations and 
treatment, physical and psychological consequences 
(including on a short and long-term) (LoE 2) [9].
Pregabalin, as an α-2-δ subunit antagonist voltage￾gated Ca2+ channels, has shown benefits in terms of anxi￾olysis (LoE 1), chronic pain (LoE 1), reduction of opioid 
consumption (LoE 1), improving postoperative analgesia 
(LoE 2), reduction of postoperative hyperalgesia (LoE 2) 
and prevention of chronic post-surgical pain (LoE 1) [10–
13]. Timing of administration is important, as it takes 
6 h after oral administration to reach cerebrospinal fluid 
levels associated with decreased central nervous system 
sensitization [14]. To reduce preoperative anxiety (which 
is not limited to the day of surgery) and sleep distur￾bances [15, 16], and to obtain stable drug concentrations 
(i.e. after at least 5 half-life, 24–48  h [17, 18]), patients 
received 150  mg twice a day for 5  days before surgery 
(LoE 2).
Additionally, on the morning of surgery, as an anxio￾lytic premedication and to anticipate postoperative pain 
and emergence agitation, patients receive 150 mcg of oral 
clonidine (LoE 1) [19].
Intraoperative phase
To decrease postoperative pain, analgesic consump￾tion without delaying recovery, intravenous clonidine 
(an α2-agonist) is added during the induction of general 
anesthesia, up to 4 mcg/kg [20] (LoE 1). With its unique 
vasoactive properties, clonidine has the significant advan￾tage of decreasing portal and vena cava pressure, useful in 
the context of hepatic surgery. It also improves hemody￾namic stability and permits opioid-free anesthesia. While 
adverse effects are well known (hypotension and brady￾cardia), they have not been associated with any significant 
sequel, confirming its safety profile [21–23] (LoE 1).
Due to the small number of pediatric liver transplan￾tation centers in the world, most of these donors come 
from abroad and do not speak either French, English or 
Dutch. Because of this, and regarding the living donor 
condition (i.e. typically at risk of high levels of anxiety), 
and depending on the preference of the patient, we pro￾pose an inhalatory induction (sevoflurane), before a large 
venous catheter placement (LoE 5).
After the induction, the anesthesia is maintained with 
a continuous infusion of propofol, guided by an elec￾troencephalographic monitoring (Neurowave Systems 
inc). Propofol lowers the risk of postoperative nausea 
and vomiting [24, 25] (LoE 1). Moreover, there may be 
additional arguments for its use in the context of liver 
transplantation, where inflammation and ischemia–rep￾erfusion injuries are of potential concern. Propofol has 
shown anti-inflammatory effects [26–30] and may also 
reduce acute postoperative pain scores [31] (LoE 3).
Opioids are known to cause hyperalgesia [32, 33] and 
high intraoperative doses are associated with higher

postoperative pain level [32] and morphine consumption 
[34, 35] (LoE 2). Opioid-free anesthesia is a strategy that, 
when part of a multimodal analgesia regimen [36], sup￾presses the risk of intraoperative opioid-induced hyperal￾gesia and decreases the risk of postoperative nausea and 
vomiting [37] (LoE 2).
Thoracic epidural is the most effective analgesic [38–
40] and anti-hyperalgesic technique [40, 41] after major 
abdominal surgery (LoE 1). It allows opioid-sparing, low￾ers the incidence of pruritus and improves gut motility 
(LoE 1). It may decrease the incidence of chronic post￾operative pain [40] (LoE 2) and possibly even mortality/
morbidity [42–46] (LoE 1). Neuraxial blockade may thus 
improve recovery [47]. The associated vasodilatation may 
reduce intraoperative blood losses. Side effects include 
failure, dural puncture, epidural abscess and hematoma. 
We systematically propose thoracic epidural analgesia 
to the donor, after complete information. The epidural 
catheter is placed using a loss-of-resistance technique, in 
lateral decubitus position, after the induction of the anes￾thesia. Levobupivacaine associated to clonidine (respec￾tively a bolus 5 mL 0.5% and 1 mcg/kg is used, followed 
by a continuous infusion of 5  mL/h of levobupivacaine 
0.25%). In case of refusal (or failure) of the epidural, an 
intraoperative continuous intravenous infusion of lido￾caine can be proposed (2  mg/kg/h), associated with a 
postoperative patient-controlled morphine infusion [48, 
49] (LoE 1).
Ketamine is an anti-pro-inflammatory drug [50] and 
low “anti-hyperalgesic” doses permit opioid-sparing [33, 
51–53] (LoE 1), decrease hyperalgesia [32, 53] (LoE 1) 
and possibly the risk of postoperative chronic pain (LoE 
2) [10, 54]. We systematically administer intravenous ket￾amine (bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg at induction, followed by 
an intraoperative infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h until 30 min 
before awakening).
Perioperative intravenous infusion of magnesium 
reduces postoperative pain, morphine consumption and 
shivering [55, 56] (LoE 1). Our patients routinely receive 
a loading dose of magnesium sulphate (2–3  g) at the 
induction of anesthesia.
Administration of ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti￾inflammatory drug, reduces postoperative pain and anal￾gesic use [57–61] (LoE 1) and is not associated with an 
increased bleeding risk [62] (LoE 2). Unless contrain￾dicated, our protocol includes an intraoperative dose 
ketorolac (0.5 mg/kg, maximum of 30 mg).
A gastric tube, placed after anesthesia induction, is 
removed before awakening (LoE 1) [63–65].
Postoperative phase
All patients are extubated at the end of the surgery and 
stay 24 h in the intensive care unit.
Our postoperative analgesia regimen includes an epi￾dural (typically levobupivacaine 0.125%, clonidine 0.75–
1.5 mcg/mL, sufentanil 0.1 mg/mL; 5 mL/h, bolus 5 mL, 
lockout 50 min) or intravenous (morphine, bolus 1.4 mg, 
lockout 7  min, 30  mg max per 4  h for men and bolus 
1  mg, lockout 5  min, 25  mg max per 4  h for women) 
patient-controlled infusion. If necessary, acetaminophen 
low doses (up to 2 g a day) and ketorolac can be added.
An anesthesiologist and a nurse are dedicated to the 
Acute Pain Service. An on-call anesthesiologist is avail￾able 24/7 [66–69] (LoE 3). In case of ineffective epidural 
analgesia despite an additional bolus of local anesthetic, 
the technique is immediately replaced by an intravenous 
patient-controlled morphine infusion. Pain intensity is 
evaluated daily with an 11-point-numeric-scale (0–10) 
and prospectively registered in an electronic database. 
Pain scores superior or equal to 4 and 7 are considered 
to be respectively in moderate-to-severe pain group [70] 
and severe pain group [71].
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as numbers (percentage) or median 
[interquartile—IQR 25–75]. As distributions are not nor￾mal (Shapiro–Wilk’s test), statistical comparisons were 
made with Wilcoxon test followed by Bonferroni’s cor￾rection. JMP Pro 12.0.1 statistical package (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all the analyses.
Results
Donors
This analysis included 100 consecutive donors (53 
women, 47 men). The median age was 32.7  years [IQR 
28.4–37.3]. Sixty-nine percent of the donors were classi￾fied as ASA 1 and 31% as ASA 2. One donor’s anesthe￾sia protocol was missing and excluded from the analyses. 
For 39 others, postoperative pain scores were incomplete. 
Available data was considered for analysis.
Seventy percent of the donors were coming from 
other countries than Belgium (most of them come from 
Eastern Europe) and did not speak French, Flemish nor 
English. Nineteen were native from Belgium, 7 from the 
Netherlands, 1 from Luxembourg and 3 were coming 
from other countries but living in Belgium. For the oth￾ers, the postoperative data were considered up to their 
departure from Belgium.
Procedure
In all patients, a midline abdominal incision was followed 
by the following liver resections: a left liver lobectomy 
for 90 donors, a left hepatectomy for 6, a full left hepa￾tectomy for 3 and a right hepatectomy for 1 donor. The 
median length of surgery was 312  min [IQR 279–328]. 
The different components of the protocol for prevention 

Dewe et al. BMC Res Notes (2018) 11:834 Page 4 of 7
of pain and hyperalgesia and their rate of applications 
are summarized in Table  2. Nineteen donors received 
the entire protocol. Six patients refused the epidural 
but received all other items. Thirty donors had one ele￾ment missing and 51 had more than one element miss￾ing. Focusing on the epidural analgesia, 8 donors refused 
the technique; for one other, the insertion of the epidural 
catheter was unsuccessful.
Postoperative period
Median postoperative pain scores were, at rest and at 
mobilization respectively 3 [IQR 2–4] and 6 [IQR 4.5–7] 
on day 1; 2 [IQR 1–3] and 5 [IQR 3–6] on day 2; and 2 
[IQR 0–3] and 4 [IQR 3–5] on day 3 (Fig. 1).
Because of inefficacy of the epidural, two donors 
received a patient-controlled morphine infusion on the 
day of surgery. Five donors switched to a patient-con￾trolled analgesia with morphine on the next day.
Per Dindo–Clavien classification [72], we counted 
30 complications (16 grade 1, 10 grade 2 and 5 grade 
3a complications) during the follow-up (Additional 
file 1). Seventy-five patients did not present any early 
postoperative complication. Five patients presented 
more than one complication (a grade 1 and a grade 2 
or 3a complication). Two left pneumothorax were due 
to the insertion of the central venous catheter whereas 
the third (right) might be secondary to the central 
venous catheter or the surgery. Median length of stay 
was 7 days [IQR 6–7].
Two months after the surgery, seven out of the 27 
patients (26%) reported persistent pain.

No single element of our protocol was independently 
associated with any of the postoperative clinical or bio￾logical outcome.
Limitations
We describe here an evidence-based protocol for pain 
management in living related donor undergoing hepa￾tectomy for liver transplantation. This protocol, based 
on nine measures, techniques and medications is feasi￾ble and has been proposed in a series of hundred living 
liver donors. Our results show that, even when a proto￾col based on the highest level of evidence is proposed, 
the patients’ postoperative scores are comparable to 
those described in the literature [2, 41]. Furthermore, 
the number of interventions modulating hyperalgesia 
precludes any statistical inference in terms of postop￾erative outcome. To note that psychological factors 
(e.g. anxiety) were difficult to follow in this context. 
The language barrier, for example, was an important 
constraint.
In total, the protocol was entirely applied in only 19 
donors. There are several reasons for this. First, each 
anesthesiologist was free to follow this protocol. Some￾times, due to organizational constraints, the anesthesi￾ologist in charge might not have been one of the core 
team. A last limitation is the fact that the analysis on 
pain chronicization suffers from a high rate of loss to 
follow up.
In conclusion, we describe here an evidence-based 
protocol for pain management in living related donor 
undergoing hepatectomy for liver transplantation. This 
protocol, based on nine measures, techniques and med￾ications is feasible and has been proposed, but not uni￾formly applied in a series of hundred living liver donors. 
Taken together, these results show that proposing a pro￾tocol based on the most effective therapeutic measures 
is not sufficient to consider postoperative pain hepatec￾tomy for living donation a resolved issue.
