Summary
A girl aged 6 presented with haematuria and her sister (aged 5) presented with haematuria and proteinuria.
Family history showed multiple individuals suffering from end stage renal failure from the paternal side of the
pedigree. Following kidney biopsy in the father and paternal grandmother, the pathological diagnosis was of
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Exome sequencing was undertaken in the proband’s sister and
grandmother. Genetic variants shared by both affected individuals were interrogated to identify the genetic
cause of disease. Candidate variants were then sequenced in all the family members to determine segregation
with the disease. A mutation of COL4A5 known to cause Alport syndrome segregated with disease from the
paternal side of the pedigree and a variant in NPHS1 was present in both paediatric cases and inherited
from their mother. This study highlights the advantages of exome sequencing over single gene testing; disease
presentation can be heterogeneous with several genes representing plausible candidates; candidate gene(s) may
be unavailable as a diagnostic test; consecutive, single gene testing typically concludes once a single causal
mutation is identified. In this family, we were able to confirm a diagnosis of Alport syndrome, which will
facilitate testing in other family members.
1. Introduction
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a de￾scriptive term for a clinicopathological syndrome
rather than a single diagnosis. Clinically, there is
always proteinuria that is frequently nephrotic. The
pathological hallmark is segmental glomerular con￾solidation or scarring but a wide variety of different
histological patterns have been labelled as FSGS.
Mutations in several genes have been shown as causes
of familial autosomal dominant FSGS, including
ACTN4, TRPC6 and INF2, with INF2 accounting
for up to 17% of familial cases and ACTN4 and
TRPC6 accounting for 3 and 2%, respectively in a
recent study of 215 probands (Boyer et al., 2011;
Barua et al., 2013).
Alport syndrome is an inherited (usually X-linked)
disorder of type IV collagen, which usually presents
with persistent microscopic haematuria in children
or young adults. Sensorineural deafness is frequent
and some patients have eye abnormalities such as an￾terior lenticonus or retinal flecks (Savige & Colville,
2009). Proteinuria is typically mild at first and
increases with age; reaching nephrotic proportions in
some patients (Wang et al., 2002). The median age
of end-stage renal failure in male patients with
X-linked disease is the mid-twenties. The clinical
phenotype in females with X-linked disease is much
milder although some patients do progress to end￾stage renal failure (Temme et al., 2012). The most
typical and significant diagnostic renal biopsy changes
are only seen by electron microscopy (EM) where
there is a thickening of the glomerular basement mem-

(Hinglais et al., 1972). Light microscopy (LM) shows
non-specific features in the glomerular and tubulo￾interstitial compartments. For example, the glomeruli
may show a spectrum of changes including near￾normal appearances, mild mesangial hypercellularity,
mesangial proliferation and segmental and global
sclerosing lesions. These latter features mimic other
glomerular sclerosing lesions in other conditions and
primary FSGS. Mutations in the type IV collagen
genes, COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 have been
shown to cause Alport syndrome, with mutations in
the X-linked gene COL4A5 causing about 85% of
the cases.
We describe a family with five generations affected
by renal disease. Two individuals (I-1 and II-1, Fig. 1)
had renal biopsies and were given a morphological di￾agnosis of FSGS. This led to the sequencing of the
genes TRPC6, INF2 and ACTN4 but no abnormali￾ties were detected. In the current study, we chose to se￾quence the exomes of two affected family members
with the aim of identifying the genetic cause of kidney
disease in this family.
Exome sequencing determines the DNA sequence
of the protein coding regions (exons) of the genes
across the genome (the ‘exome’). This technology
allows rapid and cost-effective screening of all the
genes to investigate the genetic basis of the disease
and has already been proved to be successful in iden￾tifying novel causal mutations in an ever-growing
list of both recessive and dominant rare Mendelian
disorders (Ng et al., 2009). The strategy has proven
effective when very few or even singleton cases are
available (Worthey et al., 2011), and also as methods
for genetic diagnosis (Choi et al., 2009). Although
more than 3000 rare disorders currently have an
identified genetic cause (OMIM), at present, UK diag￾nostic laboratories only provide genetic tests for 535
of these (UKGTN: NHS Directory of Genetic
Testing). As the next generation sequencing and spe￾cifically exome analysis become more accessible,
increasingly cost effective and proves its sensitivity
in making diagnoses, it is gaining favour as a viable
alternative to the standard methods.
2. Materials and methods
(i) Study subjects
The index patient (III-1) was referred aged 6 years
(Fig. 1) following the incidental finding of persistent
microscopic haematuria. Examination revealed a well￾grown child with height on the 50th centile and weight
on the 75th. Blood pressure and fundoscopic examin￾ation were normal.
The proband’s sister (III-2) was first seen aged
5 years and was generally well with a normal height
and weight (both on the 50th centile) and blood press￾ure. Fundoscopy was normal. Urine dipsticks
showed microscopic haematuria and some protei￾nuria. The urinary protein/creatinine ratio was elev￾ated at 45 mg/mmol and the albumin/creatinine ratio
was also elevated at 16·2 mg/mmol. She was therefore
started on enalapril.
The father (II-1) of these two girls was found to
have proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (plasma
creatinine 150 μmol/l) at the age of 32. By the age of
35, he was frankly nephrotic and a renal biopsy showed
FSGS. No EM was performed. Four years later he
started dialysis. His course was complicated by six epi￾sodes of dialysis-associated peritonitis treated with

gentamicin and vancomycin. He received a renal trans￾plant at the age of 42. Shortly after the renal transplant
he became aware of hearing difficulties. This was
attributed to the toxicity of the drugs used to treat his
peritonitis. An audiogram at 48 years of age showed
bilateral U-shaped sensorineural hearing loss with a
threshold of 60–70 dB at 1000–2000 Hz but unexpect￾edly the threshold at 8000 Hz was only 20–30 dB.
Ophthalmological examination was normal.
The index patient’s paternal grandmother (I-1) was
found to have nephrotic syndrome and renal impair￾ment at the age of 57. A biopsy also showed FSGS.
EM of the GBM was reported as showing ‘focal thin￾ning with some disruption of the internal architecture
but no definitive basketweave [appearance was] seen.
The thin zones are too focal for a definite diagnosis
of thin basement membrane disease (TBMD).’ A
diagnosis of idiopathic FSGS was made. One year
later she started dialysis and she received a transplant
3 years after that. Ophthalmic examination was nor￾mal. She has no symptomatic hearing loss and has
not had audiology testing.
The great-grandmother of the index patient died of
renal failure and a stroke aged 67. Her family doctor
had treated her for a ‘kidney problem’ from the age of
35 years and at the age of 55 she started treatment for
hypertension. The great-great grandfather of the index
patient died of ‘chronic nephritis’ aged 57.
All the participants gave informed consent.
(ii) Exome sequencing
Of the available samples, the proband’s sister (III-2)
and her paternal grandmother (I-1) (Fig. 1), were
selected as being maximally informative for exome
sequencing. These are the two confirmed affected
individuals most distantly related. Distantly related
individuals who share less of their genomes due to
relatedness but do share the causal variant allow the
number of potential causal variants detected by
exome analysis to be minimized.
DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood
samples by the salting out method (Miller et al.,
1988). Exome capture and sequencing were conducted
at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics
at Oxford University. Data analysis was performed
by using an in-house software pipeline, consisting
of Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies, Selangor,
Malaysia) for read alignment, Samtools (Li et al.,
2009) for variant calling and Annovar (Wang et al.,
2010) for variant annotation. Full details of the
exome sequencing and analysis are given in the sup￾plementary information. The genetic variants detected
were filtered to reduce the list to those that were
non-synonymous, previously unreported (or flagged
as clinically relevant) and present in both affected
individuals.
(iii) Validation sequencing
Validation sequencing was conducted in the Wessex
Regional Genetics Laboratory on eight family mem￾bers to verify the variants and confirm segregation.
PCR products were sequenced using the standard
protocol of the Big-Dye® Terminator v1.1 Cycle Se￾quencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) and sepa￾rated on an ABI 3130×l Genetic Analyser (Applied
Biosystems, USA). Subsequent data were analysed
using the Mutation Surveyor (version 3.1) software
(SoftGenetics, USA).
3. Results
(i) Exome sequencing
Both exomes sequenced had >90% of the target
genome represented by coverage of at least 20 reads
(Supplementary Table S1). A similar number of
variants were called in each patient (III-2= 24 181,
I-1= 24 013), of these they shared 12 162 variants
(50%). After excluding the known and the synony￾mous variants but retaining the variants highlighted
as ‘clinically significant’ in dbSNP, III-2 had 93 var￾iants, I-1 had 84 variants and of these 21 were com￾mon to both patients (Table 1).
On reviewing the list of 21 genetic variants
shared by the two patients, a mutation in COL4A5
(p.G325R, rs104886088), which had previously been
identified by Knebelmann et al. (1992) in a large
family with X-linked Alport syndrome was noted.
None of the other 20 genes appeared functionally rel￾evant given the patients’ presentations.
To complete a comprehensive analysis, we further
examined the exome data for the variants in the
other known Alport syndrome or FSGS genes. We
generated a list of six genes associated with Alport
syndrome (COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, COL4A6,
MYH9 and PAX2) and 13 genes associated with
FSGS (ACE, ACTN4, ARHGAP24, COL4A3, INF2,
MMP14, MYH9, MYO1E, NPHP1, NPHS1,
NPHS2, TRPC6, WT1 and WT1-AS) taken from
The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD Pro￾fessional 2012·4 – 14 Dec 2012). Exome data from
the two patient samples were interrogated by iden￾tifying one novel variant in COL4A4 in the grand￾mother (I-1). This variant (p.R724C), is predicted
by in-silico methods to be ‘damaging’ by SIFT and
‘probably damaging’ by Polyphen2. There were no
other novel variants in the 19 genes of interest, but
there were two rare variants (41%). The first was a
non-synonymous change in NPHS1 (p.N188I,
rs145125791), which was present in III-2 but not her
grandmother. This was predicted ‘probably dam￾aging’ by Polyphen2 but ‘tolerated’ by SIFT. The se￾cond was a synonymous change in the ACE gene
(p.S346S, rs34680431) in I-1. Since it does not change

the amino acid the likelihood of this variant affecting
the disease is low.
(ii) Validation sequencing
The COL4A5 Gly325Arg variant was sequenced in
eight family members (Fig. 1) and confirmed to segre￾gate with disease following the expected X-linked
dominant pattern. This test also showed that the mu￾tation was present in the proband (III-1) and was able
to confirm her diagnosis of Alport syndrome.
The COL4A4 (p.R724C) and NPHS1 (p.N188I)
variants were also sequenced in all the eight family
members. The COL4A4 variant was confirmed in I-1
but did not segregate with the disease and was present
in several unaffected family members who had no
haematuria. The NPHS1 variant was confirmed to
be present in III-1, III-2 and II-2 and absent in all
the other family members showing that both the pae￾diatric cases inherited this variant from their mother
(Fig. 1).
(iii) Histopathology
We re-examined the renal biopsy tissue from the wax
block from the father (II-1) and the renal biopsy from
the resin block from the paternal grandmother (I-1) at
the ultrastructural level (Fig. 2). In the father’s biopsy,
the GBM in some capillary loops showed areas
of internal laminations and irregular contouring
(‘basketweave’ appearance), probably reflecting
GBM damage. However, there are also focal areas
of the GBM that appear within the normal limits
(Supplementary Fig. S1). There was variability in ap￾pearance from abnormal to more normal-appearing
areas. In the paternal grandmothers (I-1), renal biopsy
but no typical multiple lamellae or granular bodies
(‘basketweave’ pattern) were seen at the ultrastruc￾tural level. Other ultrastructural appearances are
reported in Alport syndrome including thinning of
the GBM to 100 nm (normal range approximately
250–350 nm in the UoS/UHS biomedical imaging
unit). Interestingly, the possibility of TBMD was
raised in the renal biopsy of the paternal grandmother
at presentation aged 57 (I-1). We measured the GBM
in this patient and found a mean GBM thickness
of 379 nm (minimum 307 nm, maximum 512 nm
and standard deviation 61 nm). TBMD is probably a
heterogeneous group of diseases and in some cases
is autosomal recessive with mutations in the
COL4A3 and the COL4A4 genes indicating that
TBMD is within the family of type IV collagen dis￾eases (Lemmink et al., 1996). The father’s biopsy
showed more progressive damage than the grand￾mother’s, who presented with renal disease at a
later age.

4. Conclusions
The family were referred for exome sequencing query￾ing a genetic cause of familial FSGS after known
FSGS genes were ruled out. Exome analysis identified
a COL4A5 variant previously implicated in X-linked
Alport syndrome suggesting a diagnosis of Alport syn￾drome in this family rather than familial FSGS
(Knebelmann et al., 1992). In the kindred described
by Knebelmann et al. the median age of the end-stage
disease in the affected males was relatively high at
40 years and only 9 of the 13 affected males had
deafness. These figures are consistent with the age of
end-stage renal failure and the late onset of deafness
in the proband’s father in this family. There are no
male-to-male transmissions in the family consistent
with an X-linked disease. Mutations in the COL4A5
gene are the most frequent cause of Alport syndrome
accounting for 85% of the cases (Gale, 2013).
The term FSGS does not indicate a single diag￾nosis. The histological picture to which this name is
applied is variable and can be caused by multiple
underlying disorders, ranging from genetic abnormali￾ties of the podocyte to hyperfiltration injury. FSGS
can be primary or secondary to a wide variety of
aetiologies (e.g. healing focal proliferative or necro￾tizing glomerulonephritis) but the morphological ap￾pearances are the same (Howie, 2011). The family
history in this instance was compatible with autosomal
dominant or X-linked inheritance. The only known
cause of X-linked FSGS at the time was Alport syn￾drome. Although the presentation of the index patient
with microscopic haematuria was entirely compatible
with this diagnosis, the presence of significant
proteinuria in her 5-year-old sister, late onset of renal
failure and late-onset of atypical deafness in their
father, and the lack of typical features in their grand￾mother’s biopsy, made this appear less likely.

Very recently, a syndrome of X-linked FSGS with
cardiac conduction disorder caused by the mutation
of NFX5 has been described (Esposito et al., 2013)
but the current family did not fit the phenotype.
Autosomal dominant FSGS may be caused by
mutations in several genes including INF2, ACTN4,
TRP6 and CD2AP. Of these, the INF2 mutations
are the most common causing up to 17% of familial
cases of FSGS (Boyer et al., 2011). The median age
of the end stage renal failure is about 36 years which
was compatible with our family, but when sequenced,
no mutations in this gene were found.
Patients with ACTN4 mutations typically
develop mild proteinuria in the teenage years with
some progressing slowly to end stage renal failure.
Large, osmiophyllic aggregates within the podocyte
cytoplasm have been described on electron micro￾scopic examination of biopsies from these patients
(Henderson et al., 2009). The TRPC6 mutations
cause renal disease, which presents between the second
and the sixth decades with progression to end stage
renal failure about 10 years after presentation
(Reiser et al., 2005; Winn et al., 2005). Mutations of
CD2AP are a rare cause of mostly sporadic FSGS
(Gigante et al., 2009).
The histopathological diagnosis of Alport syn￾drome can be difficult because there are a wide variety
of appearances depending on the stage of the disease
and the progression. Usually, there is a mixed histo￾logical picture of glomerular and tubulointerstitial
changes. Early in the course of Alport syndrome,
the glomeruli may appear within the normal limits
on light and EM. Later, there may be mesangial
hypercellularity and then focal and segmental scleros￾ing lesions. Foam cells may appear in the tubulointer￾stitial compartment. EM is an important diagnostic
tool in renal pathology, including the Alport syn￾drome where the typical lesion is thickening of the
GBM, which contains multiple linear lamellae 30–
100 nm wide and sometimes smaller round granules
20–50 nm diameter (the ‘basketweave’ pattern).
The reason that Alport disease may be missed is
because it can masquerade as different diseases on
renal microscopy and both the light and the electron
microscopic appearances may not show typical lesions
as in the case of this family.
In a recent series of 52 Alport syndrome patients
who were initially given an incorrect diagnosis, a diag￾nosis of FSGS was made in ten patients. Of the female
patients with X-linked Alport syndrome given the
wrong diagnosis, 34·8% were labelled as FSGS (Yao
et al., 2012). Retrospectively, presentation of the pro￾band with haematuria and a family history compatible
with X-linked inheritance were consistent with the di￾agnosis of Alport syndrome in this family.
The recommended treatment for childhood
steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome is cyclosporine,
followed by mycophenolate with or without high￾dose steroids (Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO) Glomerulonephritis Work
Group, 2012). Both these treatments have significant
toxicities. Recent studies have shown that the early
treatment of patients with Alport syndrome using
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
significantly prolongs renal survival and extends
life (Gross et al., 2012; Temme et al., 2012). Thus, ac￾curate diagnosis allows early, effective treatment of
low toxicity. We have also been able to offer a
confirmed diagnosis to other family members even
where this has not involved a change in treatment.
More importantly, we have also been able to reassure
unaffected individuals.
A filter-based exome analysis approach involves
comparing the variants to databases of known genetic
variation such as the Exome Sequencing Project,
dbSNP and the 1000 genomes project. When analys￾ing a rare Mendelian disorder, the known and the
common variants are assumed to be non-causal and
can therefore be excluded. This is a very powerful
method to distinguish the causal mutation from a
long list of variants produced. However, there are
limitations to this approach, such as in later onset
diseases where the pre-symptomatic cases may be in￾cluded in the databases; or when considering interact￾ing mutations which may not have an effect on their
own and therefore may be present in unaffected indivi￾duals and common in the general population.
A novel variant was detected in the grandmother
(I-1) in the COL4A4 gene. COL4A4 mutations cause
the autosomal form of the Alport syndrome, though
this particular variant has not been reported before.
The Arg724Cys variant was predicted to be detrimen￾tal by several in-silico methods suggesting that it may
be important in the disease. However, sequencing in
the family members showed that this variant did not
segregate with the disease. A rare (<1%) variant in
the ACE gene was also detected in the grandmothers
exome data, although did not alter the encoded
protein. The clinical importance of these two variants
remains unknown, and highlights the difficulty of deal￾ing with variants of unknown significance detected by
the next generation sequencing technology.
The median age of the end stage renal failure in the
X-linked Alport syndrome in females (49 years) is
much later than in males (25 years) and the lifetime
risk of end-stage renal failure is also much reduced
(Gale, 2013). It is unusual then that III-2 in this family
has such an early onset of proteinuria. An explanation
for the increased severity could be the presence of the
second mutation. A rare non-synonymous variant
(N188I, rs145125791) in NPHS1 was detected in
III-2 which was not present in the grandmother
(I-1). Following the sequencing of this variant in all
the available family members it was shown that both
J. Gibson et al. 170
https://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672313000220 Published online by Cambridge University Press

III-1 and III-2 had inherited this variant from their
mother. Although rare (≤1%), this variant has been
seen in the other exome cohorts with no disease pheno￾type reported. However, it has also been reported
in several other publications in patients with various
forms of nephrotic syndrome (Caridi et al., 2009;
Buscher et al., 2010; Abid et al., 2012). Interestingly,
this variant was also reported in two siblings with con￾genital FSGS who both also had truncating mutations
in NPHS2 (Koziell et al., 2002). The authors describe
digenic inheritance involving the NPHS1 and the
NPHS2 genes, requiring a ‘tri-allelic’ hit to modify
the phenotype from later onset to congenital FSGS.
Further support for the modification of the phenotype
through genetic epistasis has recently been shown with
NPHS1 and WT1 (McCarthy et al., 2013). The pro￾band (III-1) has a less severe phenotype (no protei￾nuria) than her younger sister who has a markedly
earlier age of onset compared with her grandmother.
There are many potential causes for clinical hetero￾geneity within families. Although speculative, it may
be the case in this family, that the NPHS1 variant
(predicted to be deleterious) is modifying the Alport
syndrome phenotype, resulting in an early onset of
the symptoms and confounding the effect of the
known COL4A5 variant. Although the N188I variant
in NPHS1 has not been proven to be sufficient to
cause disease, its role is biologically plausible in that
it disrupts an N-glycosylation site required for the
localization of nephrin to the plasma membrane
(Yan et al., 2002). The variation in severity in females
may be due to skewed X-inactivation, however, with￾out access to the biopsy material from the appropriate
tissues from both individuals, this cannot be tested.
This study shows the power of exome sequencing
in the diagnostics. In this family, we identified a mu￾tation causing Alport syndrome. Sequencing only
two individuals proved highly sensitive in discrimi￾nating potential disease-causing mutations from the
many thousands of variants observed in the exome
of every individual. Sequencing and Multiplex

the COL4A5 gene currently costs £863 and the com￾bined cost of the COL4A3 and the COL4A4 genes is
£1366. Exome sequencing is substantially cheaper
(∼£800 per sample) and robust to heterogeneous
and non-specific clinical presentation. A limitation
of exome sequencing is that it is estimated that
about 13% of the X-linked Alport syndrome muta￾tions are intronic, which would not be detectable by
this method (King et al., 2002). However, an advan￾tage is the ability to detect novel epistatic relationships
between the genes since, in a gene-by-gene approach,
testing would normally be concluded after the first
mutation was detected. In this family, the diagnosis
of Alport syndrome has allowed appropriate treat￾ment, testing of other family members, the early
diagnosis in the proband’s sister and the reassurance
of the unaffected family members. Along with provid￾ing a diagnosis, identification of the underlying gen￾etics causing disease may prove helpful in predicting
the prognosis without the need for an invasive kidney
biopsy (Gale, 2013).
