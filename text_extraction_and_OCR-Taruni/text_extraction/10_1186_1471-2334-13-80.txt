Abstract
Background: Healthcare-associated infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates are increasing and few
effective antibiotics are currently available to treat patients. We observed decreased carbapenem susceptibility
among K. pneumoniae isolated from patients at a tertiary private hospital that showed a phenotype compatible
with carbapenemase production although this group of enzymes was not detected in any sample. The aim of this
study was to describe the epidemiology and clinical outcomes associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
and to determine the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms.
Methods: Risk factors associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections were investigated by a
matched case–control study from January 2006 through August 2008. A cohort study was also performed to
evaluate the association between carbapenem resistance and in-hospital mortality. Bacterial identification and
antimicrobial susceptibility were determined by Vitek 2 and Etest. Carbapenemase activity was detected using
spectrophotometric assays. Production of beta-lactamases and alterations in genes encoding K. pneumoniae outer
membrane proteins, OmpK35 and OmpK36, were analyzed by PCR and DNA sequencing, as well as SDS-Page.
Genetic relatedness of carbapenem resistant isolates was evaluated by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis.
Results: Sixty patients were included (20 cases and 40 controls) in the study. Mortality was higher for patients with
carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections compared with those with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae
(50.0% vs 25.7%). The length of central venous catheter use was independently associated with carbapenem
resistance in the multivariable analysis. All strains, except one, carried blaCTX-M-2, an extended-spectrum
betalactamase gene. In addition, a single isolate also possessed blaGES-1. Genes encoding plasmid-mediated AmpC
beta-lactamases or carbapenemases (KPC, metallo-betalactamases or OXA-carbapenemases) were not detected.
Conclusions: The K. pneumoniae multidrug-resistant organisms were associated with significant mortality. The
mechanisms associated with decreased K. pneumoniae carbapenem susceptibility were likely due to the presence of
cephalosporinases coupled with porin alterations, which resulted from the presence of the insertion sequences in
the outer membrane encoding genes.

Background
Healthcare-associated infections, such as meningitis, pneu￾monia, and wound, surgical site and bloodstream infec￾tions caused by resistant gram-negative organisms such as
Klebsiella pneumoniae are increasing [1]. This is a major
public health threat and although antibiotics such as carba￾penem can be used to treat ESBL Klebsiella, some strains
of Klebsiella have developed resistance to carbapenem and
polymyxin B is the option for this XDR Klebsiella [2,3].
In 2003, the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance
System reported a 47% increase over 5 years in third￾generation cephalosporin resistance in K. pneumoniae iso￾lates recovered from patients in intensive care units (ICUs)
[4]. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes are
produced by bacteria that render them resistant to anti￾biotic treatment. Currently, there is a worldwide spread of
ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates in hospitals [5-8].
In response to this, carbapenem use has increased, result￾ing in increased bacterial carbapenem resistance [9]. Dur￾ing 2006/2007 in the US, high percentages of carbapenem￾resistant K. pneumoniae isolates (4 to 11% of pathogenic
isolates, with higher resistance found in isolates of primary
bloodstream infections) were identified in ICUs by the Na￾tional Healthcare Safety Network [10].
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) pose a
particular challenge as they cause numerous diseases,
are hard to treat and have the potential to spread within
healthcare facilities. Infections with these organisms
are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality
[11-17]. Bacterial resistance to carbapenems may involve
several combined mechanisms, such as the hyperproduc￾tion of AmpC β lactamases (cephalosporinases) and/or
production of ESBLs and/or specific carbapenem hydro￾lyzing enzymes (carbapenemases) associated with altera￾tions in the bacterial outer membrane proteins and
hyperexpression of efflux systems [9]. The production of
carbapenemase enzymes (KPC enzymes) is the most im￾portant mechanism of resistance to carbapenems in K.
pneumoniae. The blaKPC gene is mostly plasmid-encoded
and can be transferred to different K. pneumoniae clones
and even to different bacterial genera [17].
Currently, K. pneumoniae is the most frequent species
of CRE found in the United States and has recently been
detected in Brazilian hospitals [18-20]. The outbreak and
endemic dissemination of KPC-producing K. pneumo￾niae in hospitals is related to cross transmission with the
predominance of few clones [12,21]. Contact precautions
and active surveillance are common measures employed
for controlling the spread of these microorganisms in
hospitals [22].
We observed a decrease in carbapenem susceptibility
among K. pneumoniae in the Hospital Israelita Albert
Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil. Interestingly, carbapenemase
production was not detected in these strains and thus
we investigated the epidemiology and clinical outcomes
associated with these pathogens and determined their
mechanism of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
Methods
Patients and data collection
This study was conducted at the Hospital Israelita Albert
Einstein (HIAE), a 620-bed private tertiary hospital in
São Paulo, Brazil. Approximately 36,000 patients are ad￾mitted each year and most ward patients are hospitalized
in private rooms.
All patients presenting K. pneumoniae healthcare￾associated infections (HAIs) during the period from
January 2006 to August 2008 were identified through the
HIAE infection control database. Healthcare-associated
infections were defined as those acquired after 48 hours of
hospital admission. Active surveillance of all HAIs was
performed by trained infection control nurses using Cen￾ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions
[23] in the following units: bone marrow transplantation
unit, step-down units, adult intensive care, pediatric and
neonatal intensive care units. All episodes of catheter￾associated bloodstream infections and surgical site infec￾tions were actively surveyed in all wards. When a patient
had multiple episodes of K. pneumoniae infection, only
the first occurrence was included in the study. A matched
case–control study was performed to identify risk factors
associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae.
Patients presenting carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
infections were considered as belonging to the case group
or classified under the case group and compared to
the control group (patients infected by carbapenem￾susceptible K. pneumoniae). Matching was performed at a
ratio of 1:2 according to infection date, anatomic site of in￾fection, and the unit where infection was acquired. The as￾sociation between carbapenem resistance and in-hospital
mortality was evaluated by a cohort study and included all
patients (case and control subjects). Both study strategies
were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the
Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein.
K. pneumoniae isolates with imipenem and/or merope￾nem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ≥ 2 μg/ml
as assessed by the Vitek 2 automated system (BioMérieux,
St Louis, MO) were screened as possible carbapenemase
producers. The reduced susceptibility or resistance to car￾bapenems was confirmed by Etest (BioMérieux, Marcy￾l'Etoile, France). The interpretative criteria for antimicrobial
susceptibility testing were according to the Clinical Labora￾tory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100-S19 document [24].
Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Vari￾ables analyzed as risk factors included sex, age, level of
comorbidity [25], underlying disease severity [26], and
treatments and procedures performed prior to the infection
(such as steroid administration, neutropenia, dialysis, solid￾Correa et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2013, 13:80 Page 2 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/13/80

organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, surgery,
use of invasive devices, and exposure to antibiotics). Length
of hospital stay and previous ICU hospitalization before in￾fection acquisition were also considered. Illness severity
was assessed according to APACHE II and SOFA scores
for patients hospitalized in ICUs [27,28].
The Charlson score was divided into ≥ 3 (higher degree
of underlying comorbidity), and ≤ 2 (lower degree). Anti￾microbial usage was considered only when it occurred
within 15 days prior to the infection diagnosis and its ad￾ministration lasted for at least 48 hours [29]. Data regarding
the antibiotics administered after isolation of K. pneumo￾niae, the time of administration, and whether the treatment
was appropriate were collected. Adequate empiric anti￾microbial treatment was defined as therapy administered
within 24 hours after cultures samples were obtained that
included the administration of an antimicrobial agent to
which the K. pneumoniae isolate was resistant. Antimicro￾bial agents were considered adequate if the organism was
susceptible, except when cephalosporins were used for the
treatment of ESBL infections [30,31]. Septic shock was
defined as sepsis associated with hypotension unresponsive
to intravenous fluid challenge or requiring a vasopressor
agent [32].
Microbiological studies
Among the 20 K. pneumoniae isolates responsible for
causing infection, 17 strains from 16 patients were viable
after being stored at −80°C. For comparison purposes, a
K. pneumoniae isolate susceptible to carbapenems was
also included in the microbiological analysis because it
was previously isolated from a patient who was subse￾quently infected by K. pneumoniae with reduced suscep￾tibility to carbapenems .
Imipenem and meropenem MICs were confirmed
by CLSI broth microdilution (TREK Diagnostic Inc.
Westlake, OH). Quality control was performed by test￾ing Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa ATCC 27853.
Hydrolysis of imipenem was assessed by UV spectro￾photometric assays as previously described [33]. Briefly,
a full 10 μl loop of the test organism was inoculated into
500 μl of phosphate buffer 100 mM (pH 7.0) and then
disrupted by sonication. Whole protein extracts were
obtained after centrifugation. Hydrolytic activity of 20 μl
of the crude extract was determined against 100 μM imi￾penem in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and mea￾surements were carried out at a 297 nm wavelength.
Specific primers under standard PCR conditions were
used to detect ESBL- and carbapenemase encoding
genes, namely, blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaGES, blaKPC,
blaIMP, blaVIM, blaSPM, blaGIM, blaSIM, blaOXA-2, blaOXA￾10, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-51, blaOXA-58
[34-37]. Amplified DNA fragments were purified with
the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Quiagen, Courtaboeuf,
France) and sequenced on both strands with an automated
ABI 337 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
USA). The nucleotide and deduced protein sequences
were analyzed with software available over the internet at
the National Center for Biotechnology Information web￾site. Alteration in the ompK35 and ompK36 genes that en￾code the K. pneumoniae major outer membrane porins
were investigated by PCR and DNA sequencing [38]. Six￾teen carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were
sequenced for the ompk35 and ompk36 genes, as well as
evaluated the OMP profiles by sodium dodecyl sulfate￾polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) [39].
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed
using SpeI. The results were interpreted following the cri￾teria of Tenover et al. [40].
Statistical analysis
For continuous variables, mean values were compared
using two sample t-tests for independent samples. The
Mann–Whitney U-test was performed for non-normally￾distributed continuous variables. Differences in propor￾tions were compared using a Chi-square test or Fisher’s
exact test when appropriate. Mean values are reported ± 1
SD. All tests of significance are two-tailed. When collin￾earity was identified between two variables, the one with
the greatest clinical relevance associated with the event
was included in the multivariate analysis. Odds ratios
(OR) were calculated for independent variables associated
with in-hospital mortality among patients with K. pneu￾moniae infections and for independent variables asso￾ciated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. The
association of independent variables was expressed as
OR with 95% confidence intervals. Alpha was set at
0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the Stat￾istical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS 17.0,
Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 236 episodes of K. pneumoniae healthcare￾associated infections were diagnosed in 175 patients during
the study period. Twenty patients had carbapenem￾resistant K. pneumoniae infections (8.5%), an overall rate of
0.7 episodes of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae noso￾comial infections per 10,000 patient-days. The carbapenem￾resistant K. pneumoniae infections were: urinary tract infec￾tions (9), central venous catheter-associated bloodstream
infections (5), surgical site infections (4) and skin and soft
tissue infections (2).
There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) among
cases and controls, with regard to baseline demographic
and clinical characteristics. Among the 20 patients with
imipenem and/or meropenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
infections, 10 (50.0%) died during hospitalization, while 11

(27.5%) of the 40 patients with carbapenem-susceptible K.
pneumoniae infections (p = 0.085) died.
By univariable analysis (Table 1) carbapenem-resistant
K. pneumoniae infection was associated with previous
ICU stay, central venous catheter catheterization, a longer
central venous catheter use, and exposure to antimicro￾bials. By multivariable analysis only the length of central
venous catheter use was independently associated with
carbapenem resistance (OR 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01-1.16]).
Risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality among
patients with K. pneumoniae infection measured by uni￾variable analysis included receiving dialysis, elevated APA￾CHE scores, and vasopressor drug administration and
were predictors of death (Table 2). The prescription of an
adequate initial antimicrobial regimen according to sus￾ceptibility testing results was not associated with patient
survival. The appropriate definitive antimicrobial therapy
was delayed in 3 days (median) in both groups, case and
control patients.
The results of the GES, CTX-M enzyme production, and
the amplicon resulted of PCR amplification of the ompk35
and ompk36 are shown in Table 3. Among the 17 K. pneu￾moniae isolates evaluated, no carbapenem hydrolysis was
detected by spectrophotometric assay or the presence of
genes encoding plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase
or carbapenemases. Only one strain revealed the presence
of the blaGES-1 gene and all strains except one showed
blaCTX-M-2, genes responsible for codifying ESBL. PCR
analysis of OMP-encoding genes showed altered amplicons
of at least one OMP-encoding gene, including a lack of
amplification (8 isolates, 47.1%) or enhanced amplicon size
(9 isolates, 53.0%). Through the DNA sequencing of some

of these amplicons (data not shown), we observed that ac￾quisition of insertion sequences (IS) were responsible for
the unexpected, higher molecular size of the ompK35 or
ompk36 amplification. Mutations on OmpK35- and/or
OmpK36-encoding genes was observed in all isolates
presenting only the constitutively OmpA in the SDS gels,
such as a premature stop codon or a insertion sequence
disrupting the porin gene. Seven different PFGE patterns
were observed with a predominance of one subtype. This
predominant subtype was observed in seven patients.
Among these patients only two have been in the same
intensive care unit for six days, although this period of
companionship was about two months before the onset of
the infection.
Analysis of the clinical isolate from a patient who ini￾tially harbored a K. pneumoniae-susceptible strain and
then subsequently presented with a K. pneumoniae-re￾sistant strain, demonstrated that although this strain
belonged to the same PFGE subtype, it had no amplifica￾tion of ompk36 gene. It suggests that the patient
remained infected by the same K. pneumoniae clone that
had become resistant to carbapenems probably due to
the acquisition of an ESBL encoding gene and loss of
OmpK36.
Discussion
Carbapenem resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae is
an emerging phenomenon of vast clinical and public health
importance. Controlling the spread of KPC enzymes is dif￾ficult once the gene encoding this enzyme reside on trans￾missible plasmids [23]. Current automated susceptibility
testing methods have failed to reliably detect carbapenem
resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates [38]. In this
study, we obtained MICs for K. pneumoniae isolates by
broth microdilution, thus avoiding the misclassification of

some case patients as potential control subjects. During
the study period, all K. pneumoniae isolates with MIC ≥ 2
μg/ml detected by the Vitek system were submitted for
other susceptibility tests and screened for KPC production.
K. pneumoniae isolates harboring KPC enzymes had MICs
for carbapenem in a range that allowed K. pneumoniae to
remain susceptible to carbapenem, and could therefore go
unrecognized. Since 2010 CLSI have changed breakpoints
and Enterobacteriaceae isolates with MICs for imipenem
and/or meropenem ≥ 2 μg/ml have been categorized as
intermediate or resistant (CLSI, M100-S20-U). Therefore,
some strains included in our study would be classified as
imipenem and/or meropenem resistant if the most recent
CLSI breakpoints are applied.
The presence of a premature stop codon in the porin gene
could explain why some K. pneumoniae isolates included in
the present study presenting an ompK35 or ompK36 ampli￾con size of 1000 bp are resistant to carbapenens.
During the 32 months of the study period, 20 patients
were diagnosed with healthcare-associated infections
caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains
in our hospital. This represented 8.5% of the total epi￾sodes of K. pneumoniae healthcare-associated infections.
Analysis of data on infectious disease outcomes of pa￾tients revealed that carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
patients had a higher mortality compared with patients
infected with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae
(50.0% and 27.5%, respectively), although it was not statis￾tically significant (p=0.085). Similar harmful effects on
patient outcomes have been observed in previous studies
where carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae associated
mortality was between 30 and 50% [11,12,15,16,21,41,42].
These studies examined the epidemiology of KPC produ￾cers during K. pneumoniae related-infections. Of interest,
although patients included in our study were infected by
carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains that did not
produce KPC carbapenemase, they had similar outcomes
in terms of mortality.
Evaluation of the factors that predict carbapenem resist￾ance by univariable analysis, demonstrated that prior ICU
stay, central venous catheterization, longer use of a central
venous catheter, and exposure to antimicrobials were asso￾ciated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection.
In the multivariable analysis only the length of central ven￾ous catheter use was independently associated with K.
pneumoniae carbapenem resistance. Previous studies
reported similar risk factors for carbapenem-resistant K.
pneumoniae infection and demonstrated associations with
length of hospital stay, ICU admission, use of central ven￾ous catheter, recent solid-organ or stem-cell transplant￾ation, receipt of mechanical ventilation, and exposure to
broad-spectrum antibiotics [11,12,15]. Overestimation of
the importance of antibiotic exposure as a risk factor is a
common selection bias in case–control studies in which
control subjects have susceptible isolates. Surprisingly, in
this study carbapenem use was not an independent pre￾dictor for carbapenem resistance. This unexpected finding
may be related to the small sample size of this study.
To further explore the risk of mortality in K. pneumoniae￾infected patients (both case studies and controls), we
evaluated the impact of patient characteristics and treat￾ment interventions. Unexpectedly, the initial treatment
of patients with antibiotics for clinical isolates that were
in vitro susceptible to treatment was not associated with
patient survival.
Therefore, poor patient outcomes cannot be fully
explained by a delay in providing the appropriate therapy.
Previous studies have suggested that removal of the focus
of infection, such as a catheter, debridement, or drainage,
is an effective way of improving survival among patients
with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections [11].
However, this adjunctive therapy was not evaluated in
our study.
Besides observing clinical characteristics, we also per￾formed molecular analysis of isolated K. pneumoniae
strains to analyze the mechanisms of antimicrobial resist￾ance, and to rule out the possibility of an outbreak during
the study period. Although carbapenemase encoding
genes including blaKPC were not identified in any of the K.
pneumoniae isolates studied, blaCTX-M-2 and blaGES-1,
ESBL encoding genes were detected in our collection. In
addition, we observed changes in OMP-encoding genes
amplicon size by PCR in 9 isolates suggesting the likeli￾hood of altered porin functions. The amplicon size
expected for ompK35 or ompk36 amplification is around
1000 bp. Through the DNA sequencing of some of these
amplicons, we observed that acquisition of insertion
sequences were responsible for the unexpected, higher
molecular size of the ompK35 or ompk36 amplification.
Therefore, we conclude that impermeability of outer
membrane proteins contributed considerably to carbape￾nem decrease susceptibility in those K. pneumoniae iso￾lates, especially when these isolates were ESBL producers
(especially CTX-M-2- producing K. pneumoniae).
Most cases did not cluster in time and space. Molecular
epidemiology revealed that the isolates belonged to
seven distinct clones, although one subtype was pre￾dominant. However, most cases could not be linked to a
specific patient-to-patient transmission event or to a
common source.
Our results show that cephalosporinase production
associated with porin modifications likely contributed to
carbapenem resistance. This study focused on bacterial
infection not colonization, and this allowed for a more
accurate analysis of prognosis and mortality, as we only
included patients with ongoing infections.
There were a number of limitations in this study. First,
we had a low number of episodes of carbapenem-resistant

K. pneumoniae infections in our hospital, suggesting the
number of samples analyzed was small. Moreover this
sample size may be underpowered to detect small signifi￾cant differences. Second, we were not able to include prior
colonization with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
in our risk factor analysis for invasive infection, because
the colonization status of each patient was unknown. At
that time point we did not perform active surveillance
for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (by rectal
or peri-rectal swabs). Third, the case–control design
for analyzing the risk factors for antimicrobial resistance
has some limitations. The use of patients infected with
carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae as control sub￾jects may be falsely inflated prior antimicrobial exposure
(which was not observed in our study). The ability to
match control-patients on important variables, such as
time at risk and location, is problematic in case–control
studies. Finally, because this study was performed at a sin￾gle medical center, these results may not extrapolate to
other hospitals.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the analysis of antimicrobial resistance
and the molecular characterization of K. pneumoniae
were useful for understanding preventive measures that
should be implemented in the hospital.
