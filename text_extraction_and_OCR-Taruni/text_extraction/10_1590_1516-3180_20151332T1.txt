ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Our previous systematic review has demonstrated that 
antioxidant supplements may increase mortality. We have now updat￾ed this review.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidant 
supplements for prevention of mortality in adults. 
METHODS:
Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, 
Lilacs, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceed￾ings Citation Index-Science to February 2011. We scanned bibliogra￾phies of relevant publications and asked pharmaceutical companies for 
additional trials. 
Selection criteria: We included all primary and secondary prevention 
randomized clinical trials on antioxidant supplements (beta-carotene, 
vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no 
intervention. 
Data collection and analysis: Three authors extracted data. Random￾effects and fixed-effect model meta-analyses were conducted. Risk of 
bias was considered in order to minimize the risk of systematic errors. 
Trial sequential analyses were conducted to minimize the risk of ran￾dom errors. Random effects model meta-regression analyses were per￾formed to assess sources of intertrial heterogeneity. 
MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-eight randomized trials with 296,707 partici￾pants were included. Fifty-six trials including 244,056 participants had 
low risk of bias. Twenty-six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. 
Fifty-two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a 
stable phase. The mean age was 63 years (range 18 to 103 years). The 
mean proportion of women was 46%. Of the 78 trials, 46 used the par￾allel-group design, 30 the factorial design, and 2 the cross-over design. 
All antioxidants were administered orally, either alone or in combina￾tion with vitamins, minerals, or other interventions. The duration of sup￾plementation varied from 28 days to 12 years (mean duration 3 years; 
median duration 2 years). Overall, the antioxidant supplements had no 
significant effect on mortality in a random-effects model meta-analysis 
(21,484 dead/183,749 (11.7%) versus 11,479 dead/112,958 (10.2%); 78 
trials, relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05) but 
significantly increased mortality in a fixed-effect model (RR 1.03, 95% CI 
1.01 to 1.05). Heterogeneity was low with an I2- of 12%. In meta-regres￾sion analysis, the risk of bias and type of antioxidant supplement were 
the only significant predictors of intertribal heterogeneity. Meta-regres￾sion analysis did not find a significant difference in the estimated inter￾vention effect in the primary prevention and the secondary prevention 
trials. In the 56 trials with a low risk of bias, the antioxidant supplements 
significantly increased mortality (18,833 dead/146,320 (12.9%) versus 
10,320 dead/97,736 (10.6%); RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07). This effect 
was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Excluding factorial trials with 
potential confounding showed that 38 trials with low risk of bias dem￾onstrated a significant increase in mortality (2822 dead/26,903 (10.5%) 
versus 2473 dead/26,052 (9.5%); RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15). In trials 
with low risk of bias, beta-carotene (13,202 dead/96,003 (13.8%) versus 
8556 dead/ 77,003 (11.1%); 26 trials, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09) and 
vitamin E (11,689 dead/97,523 (12.0%) versus 7561 dead/73,721 (10.3%); 
46 trials, RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.05) significantly increased mortality, 
whereas vitamin A (3444 dead/24,596 (14.0%) versus 2249 dead/16,548 
(13.6%); 12 trials, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.18), vitamin C (3637 
dead/36,659 (9.9%) versus 2717 dead/ 29,283 (9.3%); 29 trials, RR 1.02, 
95% CI 0.98 to 1.07), and selenium (2670 dead/39,779 (6.7%) versus 
1468 dead/22,961 (6.4%); 17 trials, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) did not 
significantly affect mortality. In univariate meta-regression analysis, the 
dose of vitamin A was significantly associated with increased mortality 
(RR 1.0006, 95% CI 1.0002 to 1.001, P = 0.002). 
AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support antioxi￾dant supplements for primary or secondary prevention. Beta-carotene 
and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vi￾tamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal 
products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing.

COMMENTS
Antioxidant supplements have been greatly used allegedly to prevent 
morbidity and mortality, and as anti-aging treatments. However, some 
previous evidence showed that at least some of these antioxidant 
supplements may even increase mortality. In this updated systematic 
review, the authors assessed whether different doses of beta-carotene, 
vitamin A and vitamin E affected mortality when used for primary and 
secondary prevention.
They found that there was no evidence to support the use of anti￾oxidant supplements for prevention of mortality. Moreover, the use of 
beta-carotene and vitamin E significantly increased mortality, indepen￾dently of the dose. In addition, dose-related increased mortality was 
found through evaluating vitamin A data by means of univariate meta￾regression analysis. 
With increasing marketing of and publicity for anti-aging therapies and 
antioxidants, physicians in general and primary care physicians in par￾ticular will increasingly be under pressure from patients to prescribe 
these supplements. Moreover, free access to these compounds over 
the counter in pharmacies makes abuse of such supplements a matter

of concern. In fact, the current evidence on the effects of beta-carotene, 
vitamin A and vitamin E on mortality, disease occurrence and quality of 
life does not support use of these antioxidant supplements in a popula￾tion without nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, based on the evidence 
that antioxidant supplements may cause harm, it suffices to highlight 
the authors’ conclusions: “Antioxidant supplements need to be consid￾ered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation 
before marketing”.
