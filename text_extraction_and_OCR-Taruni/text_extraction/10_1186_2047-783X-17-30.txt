Abstract
Background: Secondary sclerosing cholangitis is a severe disease of the biliary tract. Over the last decade, several
cases of sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SC-CIP) were reported. Reports in the literature so far are
characterized by a wide variety of underlying causes of critical illness, thereby hindering a risk-factor analysis. We
report on a homogenous cohort of critically ill patients with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and severe acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), of whom a subgroup developed sclerosing cholangitis, allowing for probing
of risk factors associated with SC-CIP.
Methods: Twenty-one patients (5 female, 16 male, 46.3 ± 10.8 years) with severe ARDS due to H1N1 pneumonia
were retrospectively divided into two groups, characterized by the presence (n = 5) and absence of SC-CIP (n = 16).
A large array of clinical data, laboratory parameters, and multi-detector computed tomography-derived measures
were compared.
Results: Both patient groups showed severe pulmonary impairment. Severity of disease on admission day and
during the first 14 days of treatment showed no difference. The patients developing SC-CIP had a higher body
mass index (BMI) (37.4 ± 6.0 kg/m2 vs. 29.3 ± 6.8 kg/m2
; P = 0.029) and a higher volume of intraperitoneal fat (8273 ±
3659 cm3 vs. 5131 ± 2268 cm3
; P = 0.033) and spent a longer cumulative period in the prone position during the first
14 days (165 ± 117 h vs. 78 ± 61 h; P = 0.038).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that obesity, intraperitoneal fat volume, and a longer cumulative duration spent in the
prone position may put patients with ARDS at risk of developing SC-CIP. These results lead us to propose that the
prone position should be carefully deployed, particularly in abdominally obese patients, and that frequent checks be
made for early hepatic dysfunction.

Background
Secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients
(SC-CIP) has only recently been described as a compli￾cation in patients suffering from severe life-threatening
illness requiring prolonged intensive care treatment. In
the first review of SC-CIP, it was suggested that mechan￾ical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pres￾sure (PEEP) and low tidal volume in combination with
vasoconstrictor therapy might promote arterial hypoper￾fusion of the peri-biliary vascular plexus, causing ische￾mic injury to bile duct epithelium, triggering the
development of sclerosing cholangitis [1]. Prone posi￾tioning of the patient in the ICU might have an additive
effect [2]. In reported cases of SC-CIP in literature, the
number of liver function tests indicating cholestasis
increased during the first two weeks after the beginning
of mechanical ventilation, which is typical for SC-CIP
[2]. If SC-CIP develops, prognosis appears to be poor, as
SC-CIP is associated with high mortality in the early dis￾ease course, owing to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome
(MODS), and, often liver transplantation will be required
if the patient survives the initial life-threatening disease
[3]. Until now, there have been reports of 78 patients
developing SC-CIP in the literature, mainly as case
reports or case series. In these reports, however, a great
variety of underlying causes of life-threatening disease
requiring prolonged intensive care treatment were
described, hindering a risk-factor analysis for the devel￾opment of SC-CIP. All patients reported herein suffered
from life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) due to influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia, that is,
the same underlying disease. Furthermore, retrospective
analysis of these patients revealed not only two groups
differing in the development of SC-CIP (approximately
25% with SC-CIP) but also very homogenous patient
characteristics in both groups, with no significant differ￾ences in pre-existing comorbidities, nor any significant
difference in clinical presentation on admission day ex￾cept for higher body mass index (BMI). Hence, with
these excellent prerequisites, we hypothesized that
detailed comparison of both groups might uncover risk
factors for the development of SC-CIP.
Methods
This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics
committee. Individual informed consent was waived by
the local ethics committee for this retrospective study.
Patients
Twenty-three patients with ARDS and positive polymer￾ase chain reaction for influenza A (H1N1) in the winter
seasons 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 were admitted to our
ICU. Twenty-one patients (5 female, 16 male, 46.3 ±
10.8 years) were included in this retrospective analysis.
Because SC-CIP was shown to develop only after pro￾longed intensive care treatment, two patients had to
be excluded from the retrospective analysis as they
had died within a fortnight after admission, owing to
intracerebral bleeding and persisting hypoxemia with
contraindication to extracorporeal lung support. The
remaining 21 patients were divided into two groups as
follows: patients who developed SC-CIP (SSC-group)
and patients who did not develop SC-CIP (nSSC￾group). Diagnosis of SC-CIP was based on four criteria
according to Benninger [4]: (i) severe, life-threatening
trauma or disease; (ii) slowly increasing signs of cho￾lestasis with a secondary moderate rise of aminotrans￾ferases, in contrast with ‘shock liver’; (iii) typical
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)-like appearance of
the intrahepatic bile ducts with multifocal strictures
and dilatations in endoscopic retrograde cholangiog￾raphy (ERCP); (iv) exclusion of other liver diseases.
According to these criteria, five patients (5 male, 0 fe￾male, mean age 46.4 ± 9.7) fulfilled all diagnostic cri￾teria of SC-CIP. Sixteen patients (11 male, 5 female,
mean age 46.2 ± 11.4) did not develop SC-CIP.
Twenty-four days after admission, one patient of the
SSC-group died of a cerebral hemorrhage before a typ￾ical PSC-like appearance could be confirmed by ERCP;
in this patient, however, all other criteria for SC-CIP
were fulfilled and histopathologic post-mortem findings
confirmed secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC).
Clinical data
Clinical data and laboratory values on the day of admis￾sion, days 1, 2, 3, and 7 after admission, and weekly
thereafter until day 49, were extracted from comprehen￾sive clinical documentation. Since all patients had been
transferred to our tertiary university hospital after initial
treatment and intubation in external hospitals, the time
of admission to the external hospital and ICU and the
time of intubation were also documented. According to
the standard operating procedure for patients with
ARDS admitted to our ICU, cranial, thoracic, and ab￾dominal computed tomography (CT) data were acquired
on the day of admission to the tertiary hospital in all but
one patient. Data on age, sex, height, body weight,
underlying medical conditions, clinical scores, and clin￾ical outcome were collected. Height was measured
manually and body weight was either taken from the proto￾col of admission of the primary care facility or requested
from next of kin. Clinical data included duration of ventila￾tion, respirator settings, blood gas analysis, frequency, and
duration of each period of prone positioning, and cumula￾tive time spent in the prone position. The clinical deci￾sion for deploying the prone position was based on
radiological findings (thoracic CT-scan in the beginning
followed by daily X-rays of the thorax), the ratio of

arterial oxygen concentra#132#tion to the fraction of
inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), and increase of PaO2/FiO2
in the prone position. There was no upper limit for pro￾nation maneuvers. Hemodynamic parameters (arterial and
central venous blood pressure, heart rate), catecholamine
and fluid therapy, anti-infective therapy, and supportive
medication (for example, selenium), as well as the need
for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO), duration of ECMO, and required blood flow
were recorded.
The severity of illness was assessed using the new Sim￾plified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) [5] and Sepsis￾related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [6]. The
severity of ARDS was assessed with the Lung Injury
Score [7]. Endpoints of this study were discharge from
the ICU, day 49, or death.
Laboratory values
Inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, interleu￾kin-6, leukocytes), liver function tests (alanine trans￾aminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline
phosphatase (AP), total bilirubin (TBIL), γ-glutamyl
transpeptidase (GGT)), and oxygen supply (arterial
blood oxygen content, blood lactate concentration) were
included in the analysis. In addition, blood concentra￾tions of anti-nuclear antibody, perinuclear antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody, and procollagen peptide III were
measured on the day of admission.
Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT)
All but one patient underwent (in addition to thoracic scan￾ning) abdominal contrast-enhanced MDCT scanning (64-
MDCT SOMATOM Sensation, 128-MDCT SOMATOM
Definition AS, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany; 64-MDCT
Brilliance, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at the time
of admission (5 mm slice thickness, 20 or 70 s after intra￾venous administration of non-ionic iodine contrast
media corresponding to the arterial or portal venous
phase, 1.5 ml/kg body weight, followed by 100 ml of saline,
3 ml/min flow, (Imeron 350, Bracco SpA, Milan, Italy). All
images were reviewed in the soft tissue and bone window.
MDCT-derived parameters
The following parameters were taken from the abdom￾inal MDCT: the presence of ascites, atherosclerosis, or
calcifications at the origin of the intra-abdominal arter￾ies; the diameter of the common hepatic artery; and the
presence of intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. The sagit￾tal diameter of the abdomen was measured at the L4/5
level. In addition, the diameter of the anterior abdominal
subcutaneous fatty tissue was measured at the same
level, as well as the horizontal intraperitoneal diameter
(the distance between both transverse abdominal mus￾cles at the L4/5 level). Furthermore, the volumes of
abdominal fatty tissue (subcutaneous, intraperitoneal,
and retroperitoneal fat) and of the intra- and retroperi￾toneal fat only were quantified by manual segmentation,
using commercial software (syngo, version VE32B on an
MMWP workstation running Somaris 2008G, Siemens
HealthCare, Forchheim, Germany). For this evaluation,
upper (−30 Hounsfield units) and lower (−300 Houns￾field units) density values were defined to represent fatty
tissue. For this semiautomatic approach, slices from the
diaphragm down to the caudal border of the pubic sym￾physis were included. Manual outlining followed the an￾terior, lateral, and posterior peritoneal walls. The volume
of the abdominal subcutaneous fatty tissue was deter￾mined by subtracting the volume of the intra- and retro￾peritoneal fat from the volume of all abdominal fatty
tissue. The ratio of the intra- and retroperitoneal fat vol￾ume to the overall abdominal fat volume was calculated.
To explore whether MDCT-derived thoracic measure￾ments of subcutaneous and intrathoracic fatty tissue give
reliable markers for obesity (and could be acquired dur￾ing thoracic scanning only) and are potential risk factors
for developing SC-CIP, the anterior to posterior diameter
of the anterior thoracic subcutaneous fatty tissue was
measured from the cutis ventral to the manubrium
sterni at the level of the first sternocostal joint, and the
maximum diameter of fatty tissue from the dorsal to the
manubrium of the sternum to the aortic arch (retro￾sternal fat) was measured.
Statistical analysis
All data were tested for normal distribution using the
Shapiro-Wilk test. Parametric data were reported as
mean ± SD, non-parametric data as median with 25th
and 75th percentiles. Depending on the data distribu￾tion, inter-group comparisons were made using either
the student’s t test, Fisher’s exact test, or the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. Changes over time were analyzed using
the Friedman rank-sum test. In case of significant differ￾ences, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was deployed for
post-hoc comparison, followed by Bonferroni’s P adjust￾ment. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analyses were carried out using the software
package R 2.11.1 (The R Project for Statistical
Computing).
Results
Clinical data and course
In all patients, a diagnosis of H1N1 infection was estab￾lished by positive H1N1 PCR, either from respiratory or
nasal secretions. Of the 21 patients analyzed, five
patients (23.8%) developed SC-CIP. Detailed patient
characteristics on the admission day are listed in Table 1.
In brief, most patients had at least one comorbidity, that
is, arterial hypertension in four (19%) and diabetes in

three patients (14%). One patient suffered from recently
diagnosed but untreated chronic lymphatic leukemia.
Five patients (24%) had a history of smoking. No patient
had a history of alcohol abuse or history of liver disease.
No patient had initial ischemic hepatitis with a high ac￾tivity of transaminases in the serum or subsequent de￾velopment of cholestatic parameters. Eight (38%)
patients were obese, as defined by the World Health
Organization as BMI > 30 kg/m2
, and ten patients were
overweight (48%) (BMI > 25 kg/m2
). The average BMI
was significantly higher in the SSC-group than in the
nSSC-group (P = 0.03). Average body weight was signifi￾cantly increased in the SSC-group, as compared with the
nSSC-group (P = 0.007). Likewise, the average body sur￾face area was significantly increased in the SSC-group,
as compared with the nSSC-group (P = 0.008). The clin￾ical course of the patients is summarized in Table 2.
Respiratory function
All patients in both groups required mechanical ventilation,
owing to severe pulmonary impairment. Protective ventila￾tor strategy with low tidal volume ventilation (≤6 ml/kg
body weight) and application of PEEP levels according to
the recommendations of the ARDS Network Group was
used. There was no difference in ventilator settings (PEEP/
peak inspiratory pressure) or development of dynamic
compliance in pressure-controlled ventilation during the
first 7 days. Ten patients (48%) required ECMO therapy. In
all but one patient, prone positioning was performed to
improve oxygenation. The mean duration of a single prona￾tion maneuver was 12 hours in both groups. The SSC￾group spent more cumulative hours in the prone position
from admission to day 14 than did the nSSC-group
(P = 0.038) (Figure 1). Oxygenation improved very slowly
in both groups (Figure 2).
Circulatory function
Catecholamine therapy was necessary in all patients on
the day of admission and on the following three days.
There was no difference in dosage until day 14. The need
for more than one catecholamine or vasopressor (that is,
norepinephrine and epinephrine ± dobutamine ± vaso￾pressin) was comparable in both groups. Lactate in arter￾ial blood analysis was slightly elevated above the
reference range in both groups during the first week but
did not differ significantly. The number of patients re￾ceiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the fre￾quency of RRT were equal in both groups during the first
week. After this time, the SSC-group needed RRT more
frequently, reaching statistical significance only after day
28. The blood oxygen content was equal in both groups.
The shock index did not differ at any time. The mean ar￾terial pressure was significantly higher in the SSC-group
on admission day than in the nSSC-group (P = 0.041);
however, there was no significant difference thereafter.

Laboratory values
No patient had a history of liver disease. Screening for
active viral hepatitis (A, B, and C) produced negative
results in all patients. The cholestasis parameters of
GGT, AP, and TBIL concentration increased within the
first two weeks in the typical pattern of SC-CIP in the
SSC-group. After Bonferroni correction, GGT concentra￾tion was found to be significantly higher on day 28 in the
SSC-group than in the nSSC-group (1650 ± 147 U/l vs.
368 ± 351 U/l; P = 0.001). Levels of AP and TBIL were
not significantly different after Bonferroni correction
(Figure 3) [4,8-10]. Activity of the enzymes ALT and AST
in serum were comparable in both groups. Levels of anti￾nuclear antibody and perinuclear antineutrophil cyto￾plasmic antibody were negative in all patients [11].
Plasma procollagen peptide III concentration, a marker
of collagen synthesis, measured on admission showed no
relevant elevation in either group [12].
The inflammatory parameters C-reactive protein,
interleukin-6, and leukocytes were elevated in both
groups on admission day without any group difference.
There was no group difference in antibiotic and anti￾viral treatment during the first two weeks.
Computed tomography
The results of the evaluation of the CT data are pre￾sented in Table 3. In brief, the abdominal fat distribu￾tion, as measured by sagittal and horizontal abdominal
diameter at the L4/5 level was characterized by higher
diameters in the SSC-group than in the nSSC-group
(P = 0.015 and P = 0.003, respectively). Cumulative ab￾dominal fat volumes did not reach significant difference,
but there was a difference in volumes of intraperitoneal
fat, with a higher volume in the SSC-group than in the
nSSC-group (P = 0.03). There was no group difference
in any of the parameters of thoracic fat measurement.
Intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis was not seen in either
group. Sludge or concrements in the gallbladder were
present in two patients of the nSSC-group. No signifi￾cant group difference emerged from the measurements
of the diameter of the common bile duct, the size of the
liver, or the size of the spleen.
Discussion
The homogenous cohort of patients with H1N1-
associated ARDS, reported herein, provided a unique op￾portunity to search for risk factors for the development
of SC-CIP, a disease of probably underestimated preva￾lence and often fatal consequence. The analysis revealed
abdominal obesity and increased intraperitoneal fat vol￾ume, as well as a longer cumulative duration of prone
positioning, in patients with H1N1-associated ARDS
who developed SC-CIP, compared with those who did
not develop SC-CIP, suggesting these parameters to rep￾resent risk factors for the development of SC-CIP. Until

now, only case reports or small case series of SC-CIP
have been published [2-4,8-10,13-16]. So far, there has
been no possibility of comparing the SC-CIP patients
with a control group, since the published cases were
characterized by inhomogeneous underlying causes for
critical illness and were collected over a long period of
time (Table 4). Compared with published data of the
clinical course of patients with H1N1-associated ARDS;
however, our patient cohort showed a similar severity of
disease, course of treatment, and outcome [17-21]. The
homogeneity of our population allowed for a group
comparison between patients with H1N1-associated
ARDS who developed SC-CIP and those who did not de￾velop SC-CIP. The laboratory and ERCP findings con￾firmed the diagnosis for the only recently described
entity of SC-CIP in approximately 25% of the whole pa￾tient cohort reported herein [1,4]. Obesity was shown to
lead to more frequent hospital admissions and to be
associated with more comorbidities, but no increase in
ICU mortality was reported in medical patients in a
meta-analysis of 14 studies with 62,405 critically ill sub￾jects, of whom one-quarter were obese and whose most
common causes of admission were respiratory disorders
[22]. Morbidity during ICU stay, however, was shown to
be increased in obese patients with a significantly higher
occurrence of nosocomial infections, a longer period on
mechanical ventilation and a longer ICU stay [23,24].
Particularly with regard to hepatic dysfunction, no differ￾ence was found in obese patients requiring ICU treat￾ment compared with overweight or normal weight
patients [23,24].
The most striking common pre-existing factor of our
patient group was obesity or being overweight, which
was previously reported to be a risk factor for developing
ARDS in H1N1 infection [18,25]. In another study, de￾velopment of ARDS was seen more frequently in obese
patients [26]. In our study, patients with SC-CIP had a
significantly higher average body weight and a higher de￾gree of obesity according to their BMI than the patients
without SC-CIP. Interestingly, abdominal obesity (mea￾sured by the sagittal abdominal diameter with a caliper),
rather than a high BMI, was reported to be associated
with a higher rate of abdominal compartment syn￾dromes and increased mortality in patients with abdominal
obesity requiring ICU treatment [27]. This supports our
finding, as there were significantly more cases of extensive
abdominal obesity in the SSC-group than in the nSSC￾group. Of note, the intraperitoneal fat volume but not the
subcutaneous abdominal fat volume was significantly
increased in the SSC-group, implying the importance of

the intra-abdominal fat distribution, that is, the intra￾versus extraperitoneal amount of fat.
In addition, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), as mea￾sured by BMI or sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), was
found to be elevated in critically ill obese patients [28].
Ventilation with PEEP > 15 cm H2O, on the other hand,
was shown to lead to a mild increase of IAP [29]. More￾over, in the first review of SC-CIP, the authors suspected
mechanical ventilation with high PEEP and low tidal vol￾ume in combination with vasoconstrictor therapy to pro￾mote arterial hypoperfusion of the peri-biliary vascular
plexus, causing ischemic injury to the bile duct epithe￾lium, and, hence, triggering the development of scleros￾ing cholangitis [1].
It was suggested that lying in the prone position would
have an additive effect [2]. Interestingly, a mild increase

in IAP was described in ventilated patients with acute
lung injury lying in the prone position on air-cushioned
beds [30]. In that study, there was an increase in cardiac
index and mean arterial pressure in patients lying in the
prone position with an unchanged plasma disappearance
rate for indocyanine green and gastric intramucosal to
arterial PCO2 in the prone compared with the supine
position. Unstable cardiovascular function, however, was
an exclusion criterion in that study and, therefore, the
effect of the prone position on hepatosplanchnic (dys)
function in hemodynamically unstable patients cannot
be ruled out. Furthermore, comparison with our results
is limited, as the average BMI of the patients in that
study (26 ± 3.7 kg/m2
) was lower than in our SSC-group
(37.4 ± 6 kg/m2
) (P = 0.0002). Pronation in ARDS has
been discussed in the literature for many years, as a
method to improve outcome and has recently been
recommended for patients with severe ARDS (PaO2/
FiO2 < 100) [31,32]. In those patients, use of the prone
position was suggested, especially if the respective ex￾perience in the treatment center was good [33]. There is
uncertainty, however, over how long the prone position
should be adopted. Mancebo et al. [34] described a
decreased mortality in patients lying in the prone
position over a longer period of time (17 h/d over a
mean of 10 d), but Taccone et al. [35] could not
confirm these results (18 h/session over a mean of
8.4 sessions). In a small series of H1N1 patients, im￾provement of hypoxemia and limitation of end-organ
dysfunction was achieved by pronation in combin￾ation with airway pressure release ventilation [17]. All
but one patient in our patient groups was placed in
a prone position, and this pronation lasted for 12h
per session in both groups. Since the cumulative time
in the prone position was significantly higher in the
SSC-group than in the nSSC-group, this might be a
factor increasing the risk of developing SC-CIP. Fur￾ther studies are warranted to investigate whether ab￾dominally obese patients with ARDS benefit from
reduced cumulative duration in the prone position or
whether the prone position should be abandoned in
these patients.
Michelet et al. [36] described a significant increase in
IAP and decrease of plasma disappearance rate for indo￾cyanine green if ARDS patients were placed in a prone
position on a conventional foam mattress; this was not
seen if an air-cushioned mattress was used. In our cen￾ter, all patients requiring pronation were placed on air￾cushioned mattresses. The comparison of the results of
our study with those of the study of Michelet et al.,
however, remains limited as their patients showed a
lower average BMI of 28.9 ± 5.33, and, hence, their
patients were considerably less overweight than the
patients of the SSC-group in our population. Another
study of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and
prone positioning showed an increase of intragastric
pressure after 60 min of pronation followed by a signifi￾cant increase of gastric intramucosal to arterial PCO2,
indicating insufficient splanchnic perfusion [37]. The
body weight or BMI of the patients was not reported in
that study. The influence of obesity on IAP in prone
position was discussed in a study of Matejovic et al.,
who did not see an increase of IAP or a decrease of
hepatosplanchnic blood flow in patients in the prone
position [38]. Again the population in this study was less
overweight, with a significantly lower BSA than the SSC￾group (P = 0.00007). To our knowledge, there have been
no reports so far of investigation of hepatic function and
splanchnic perfusion in obese patients with ARDS lying
in the prone position. The higher incidence of need for
RRT in the SSC-group after day 28 might be an epiphe￾nomenon as part of the multi-organ failure maintained
by unresolved critical illness due to progressive liver
failure.
Recently, a compromise of hepatosplanchnic perfusion
has been discussed to promote SC-CIP [1]. In our analysis,
however, vasopressor therapy and arterial lactate were
similar in the SSC- and nSSC-groups. Recently, the ad￾ministration of norepinephrine in pigs to achieve a mean
arterial pressure of 75 mmHg compared with 60 mmHg
in the control group did not reduce hepatic arterial blood
flow, hepatic venous oxygen saturation, or mesenterial lac￾tate concentration [39]. Furthermore, increasing norepin￾ephrine to achieve a higher mean arterial pressure in
vasodilatory shock after cardiac surgery or sepsis did not
reduce intestinal mucosal perfusion, tissue oxygenation, or
microvascular flow [40,41]. In a study on mechanically
ventilated adults, higher levels of PEEP (10 to 20 cm
H2O), in combination with adrenergic support because of
ARDS and septic shock, did not compromise gastric mu￾cosal perfusion [42]. Hence, taking those and our results
(no group difference in arterial lactate nor vasopressor
therapy) together, non-specific parameters for organ per￾fusion, such as lactate in arterial blood, shock index, or

mean arterial pressure, apparently do not allow a conclu￾sion on hepatic arterial perfusion and, hence, might not be
taken into account in the decision whether or not repeti￾tive prolonged pronation in obese patients should be
undertaken. Considering the results of our study, a more
cautious approach to prone positioning of morbidly obese
patients should be considered. Therefore, extracorporeal
lung assistance might be an alternative therapeutic strat￾egy in severe ARDS in obese patients. There are no spe￾cific studies evaluating the use of extracorporeal lung
assist in this patient population.
Wagner et al. looked for pre-procedure risk factors to
predict the outcome in pulmonary ECMO. They found a
trend towards a poorer outcome in patients with a
higher BMI [43]. With obesity being epidemic in many
developed countries, we are in urgent need for studies
clarifying the question of whether morbidly obese
patients with ARDS profit from interventional lung as￾sist. The main limitation of our study is the small sample
size. Nevertheless, given the rarity of SC-CIP and the
high incidence of SC-CIP in our population, we feel that
the correlation of obesity and prone position with SC￾CIP is worth reporting.
Conclusions
Considering our findings, obesity, and, in particular, the
amount of intraperitoneal fat, and a long cumulative
duration spent in the prone position appear to be risk
factors for developing SC-CIP. As body weight, intraper￾itoneal fat, and abdominal fat distribution are factors
that elude direct or rapid therapeutic intervention, the
positioning of the patient in the ICU remains the de￾cisive factor to focus on. This leads us to recommend
monitoring the laboratory parameters GGT and AP on a
daily basis in patients with ARDS in the ICU who need
pronation, and to re-position the patients should these
parameters increase.
