nature publishing group Review
Many trials of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been 
published in the past 5–6 y. MSCs inhibit T-cell alloreac￾tivity in vitro by soluble factors and direct cell-to-cell con￾tact. They are safe to infuse in humans with no acute tox￾icity and no ectopic tissue formation. Promising results 
of MSC infusion for graft-vs.-host disease and fistulizing 
Crohn’s disease (CD) have been published. Treatment 
of CD requires a comprehensive treatment approach to 
maintain symptomatic control, improve health-related 
quality-of-life measures, and minimize complications 
from the disease. In this review, we will discuss the results 
of clinical trials using a novel treatment in the form of 
MSCs for treatment of CD and related complications. 
Success of these phase I, II, and III trials have set the stage 
for usage of this novel treatment for children with CD.
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the major 
forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), represent a 
significant burden to health-care costs (1). The exact etiology 
remains unknown, but a variety of factors have been thought 
to be contributors, including environment, the individual 
immune response, and genetics. CD is chronic, uncontrolled 
inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, characterized by seg￾mental transmural mucosal inflammation and granulomatous 
changes. Any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the oral 
cavity to the perianal region may be involved. Usually both 
conditions are chronic and relapsing. The usual practice is to 
increase therapy in a stepwise fashion, progressing through 
aminosalicylates (sulfasalazine, mesalazine), antibiotics (met￾ronidazole, ciprofloxacin), corticosteroids, immunosuppres￾sive medications including thioguanine compounds (mercap￾topurine, azathioprine), methotrexate, and cyclosporin, and 
finally anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs (2). Despite a 
systematic approach to therapy and the addition of new biolog￾ics, the need for intestinal resection in CD has remained stable 
(3). Primary and secondary failure to respond to approved 
therapies, inability to provide a surgical solution to fistulizing 
manifestations, and the recurrent need for surgeries remain 
challenges requiring novel therapies in this disorder (4).
Although the incidence and prevalence of CD are beginning 
to stabilize in high-incidence areas such as northern Europe 
and North America, they continue to rise in low-incidence 
areas such as southern Europe, Asia, and much of the develop￾ing world (5). Pediatric CD is more common than ulcerative 
colitis, with an annual incidence of 0.2–8.5 per 100,000 popu￾lation (6). Most patients have a chronic intermittent disease 
course, 13% have an unremitting disease course, and 10% have 
prolonged remission. Less than half require corticosteroids at 
any point and all require surgery at least once (7).
When cells from a bone marrow aspirate are cultured in 
plastic flasks, hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic stem cells 
(HSCs) do not adhere to the plastic and are removed with a 
change of medium. The remaining plastic-adherent cells were 
originally termed colony-forming unit fibroblasts because they 
formed fibroblast-like colonies ex vivo (8). They were later 
called mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, an abbreviation for 
mesenchymal stromal cells as well) (9,10). Like HSCs, MSCs 
are rare in the bone marrow, representing 1 in 10,000 nucleated 
cells. MSCs are multipotent bone marrow cells able to differ￾entiate in vitro and in vivo into tissues of mesenchymal origin 
in mice. Moreover, these MSCs provide support for the growth 
and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in bone 
marrow microenvironments and, in animal models, promote 
engraftment of hemopoietic cells (11). The unexpected obser￾vation that MSCs inhibited T-cell proliferation in vitro in 2002–
2003 by three independent investigators opened the door for 
use of MSCs for autoimmune disorders, first in animal models 
and then in humans (10,12,13). In coculture experiments with 
allogeneic lymphocytes, MSCs do not induce lymphocyte pro￾liferation, interferon-γ production, or upregulation of activa￾tion markers. Despite this ex vivo property, survival of infused 
allogenic MSCs in immunocompetent mice was estimated to 
be less than 40 d. When mice were rechallenged, survival of 
infused MSCs was less than 5 d. There was also evidence of 
immune memory induction by MSCs, suggesting that MSCs 
cannot completely evade the immune response and are eventu￾ally rejected (12,14).
MSCs suppress proliferation of activated lymphocytes in vitro
in a dose-dependent, non–human leukocyte antigen–restricted 
manner (12). In a baboon skin-graft model, Bartholomew and 
co-workers showed that infusion of ex vivo expanded donor￾derived or third-party cells prolonged the time to rejection of 
histoincompatible skin grafts (12). Furthermore, infused cells 
improve the outcome of acute renal, neural, and lung injury,

possibly by promoting a shift from production of proinflamma￾tory cytokines to anti-inflammatory cytokines at the site of injury 
(15–17). In 2005, Zappia and co-workers demonstrated that the 
intravenous (i.v.) injection of syngeneic MSCs ameliorated the 
clinical course of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein–induced 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced 
demyelination and leukocyte infiltration of the central nervous 
system (16).Thus far, MSCs have proven to be safe and have not 
resulted in toxicity or ectopic tissue growth in an increasing 
number of human trials (18–20). However, as reported by Tolar 
et al., the potential exists for allogenic murine MSCs carrying a 
cytogenetic abnormality after multiple passages to produce sar￾coma in the lung and extremities in recipient animals (21). This 
should be considered when designing trials (22).
Pathophysiology of Cd
Twin and family studies suggest a strong genetic influence. For 
example, approximately 50% of monozygotic twins and 30% 
of offspring of two affected parents developed the disease (23). 
Linkage analysis and positional cloning strategies, together 
with subsequent genome-wide association studies, have iden￾tified more than 30 distinct genetic loci that confer suscep￾tibility. Some of the most strongly associated genes included 
CARD15, the IBD5 locus, the autophagy genes ATG16L1 and 
IRGM, and the interleukin (IL)-23 receptor (24). In CD, it is 
estimated that the genes identified so far account for less than 
20% of the total genetic risk (25). Polymorphisms in identified 
genes, and as-yet undiscovered genes, may confer susceptibil￾ity by contributing to mucosal barrier dysfunction, the innate 
immunodeficiency state, or by influencing the propagation of 
chronic inflammation in the tertiary phase of the disease (24).
Cytokines are a group of low-molecular-weight peptides 
that are active at very low concentrations and bind to specific 
receptors to produce autocrine, paracrine, and other endo￾crine effects. Proinflammatory cytokines—chemokines with 
altered adaptive and innate responses—are thought to play 
a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD (24). In CD, the major 
cytokines arise from T-helper cell (Th) 1 and Th17 CD4 T-cell 
differentiation and consist of interferon (IFN) and IL-17/IL-22 
generated by these types of differentiation (26). Human trials 
with anticytokine therapy have been successful, especially with 
TNF antagonist, in treatment of CD refractory to corticoster￾oids (27). Approximately one-third of patients do not respond 
to anti-TNF therapy, and an additional one-third subsequently 
lose response or become intolerant (28,29). Other anticy￾tokine therapies with anti-p40 IL-12/23, anti-IFN-γ, anti-IL-6 
receptor antibodies, and granulocyte–macrophage colony￾stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have met with variable success. 
In a placebo-controlled and open-label human trial of usteki￾numab, a fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal 
antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12/23, involv￾ing 131 patients, the response in the ustekinumab group was 
superior to that in the placebo arm (53% and 30%, P = 0.02) 
at 4wk. In a subgroup of 49 patients who were previously 
given infliximab, clinical response to ustekinumab was signifi￾cantly greater than that in the group given placebo (59 vs. 15% 
at week 4, P < 0.05) (30). A second trial of anti-IL-12 (ABT￾874/J695, Wyeth Research and Abbott Laboratories) used a 
recombinant, exclusively human-sequence, full-length IgG1 
antibody, genetically modified to recognize IL-12 p40 protein. 
The response rate was significantly higher in the group given 
3mg/kg than in the placebo group at the end of the 8-wk treat￾ment period (75% vs. 25%, P = 0.03) (31). Similarly, in another 
human trial of fontolizumab, a humanized anti-IFN involv￾ing 133 patients, although there was no statistically significant 
difference in clinical response between the fontolizumab and 
placebo groups after a single dose at day 28, patients receiving 
two different doses of fontolizumab 28 d apart demonstrated a 
doubled response rate at day 56 compared with those receiv￾ing placebo: 32% (9/28) vs. 69% (22/32, P = 0.02) vs. 67% 
(21/31, P = 0.03) for the placebo, 4 and 10mg/kg fontolizumab 
groups, respectively (32). In a small trial conducted in Japan, 
anti-IL-6 receptor antibody was given intravenously in ran￾domized placebo-controlled fashion. At the final evaluation, 
80% of the patients (8 of 10) given biweekly antibody had a 
clinical response as compared with 31% of the placebo-treated 
patients (4 of 13; P = 0.019) (33). In an attempt to boost innate 
immune responses, GM-CSF was tested in a randomized pla￾cebo-controlled trial in CD. A total of 123 patients underwent 
randomization at a 2:1 ratio to receive GM-CSF (6μg/kg of 
body weight) or placebo subcutaneously daily for 56 d. Clinical 
response, defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 100 
points in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score 
and remission on day 57, was significantly higher in the sar￾gramostim group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 26%, 
P = 0.01, and 40% vs. 19%, P = 0.01, respectively) (34).
A considerable body of literature suggesting an association 
between the microbiota and the immune system has recently 
emerged (35,36). Shifts in the intestinal microenvironment may 
lead to changes in the microbiota known as dysbiosis. Dysbiosis 
may increase susceptibility to intestinal inflammation (37). 
In support of this hypothesis, T-bet−/− Rag2−/− (TRUC) mice 
spontaneously develop dysbiosis and colitis, which can eventu￾ally progress to colorectal cancer (38). Remarkably, microbiota 
transferred from these donors into wild-type mice can confer 
disease (39). Subsequent studies identified two proteobacteria 
that are overrepresented in TRUC mice: Proteus mirabilis and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, as the colitogenic microbes (40). In 
contrast to the above-mentioned examples, coliform bacteria 
such as Lactobacillus caseican antagonize the proinflammatory 
effects induced by commensal Escherichia coli in human CD by 
downregulating proinflammatory mediators (41). Lactic acid 
bacteria, such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus 
brevis, repressed the mRNA expressions of IL-1-β, TNF-α, and 
IFN-γ and decreased the protein expressions of IL-1-β and 
IL-6 proteins in the colon. They were successful in prevent￾ing activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB, 
colon shortening, and myeloperoxidase productivity (42). 
In an important early study by Waidmann et al., Bacteroides 
vulgatus was able to prevent E. coli–induced colitis in gnotobi￾otic IL-2−/− mice, suggesting that probiotic bacteria can prevent 
bacterium-induced IBD (43).

Role of MSC therapy in Crohn’s disease Review
Mechanism of Msc Action
The study of human MSCs derived from subcutaneous adipose 
tissue (hASCs) in the 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse 
model has shown that hASCs inhibit T-cell activation with the 
superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEB), as measured 
by cytokine secretion and T-cell proliferation. The inhibitory 
effect was partially reversed when peripheral blood mono￾nuclear cells (PBMCs) and hASCs were separated by a semi￾permeable Transwell membrane suggesting partial cell–cell 
contact dependence (44). Moreover, the coculture of alloge￾neic PBMCs and hASCs in the same chamber of the Transwell 
system fully restored their inhibitory activity on SEB-activated 
PBMCs situated in the other chamber, suggesting that PBMC–
hASC contact induces the secretion of an immunosuppres￾sive factor(s) for T cells. IL-10 production increased in a cell–
cell contact-dependent manner in cocultures of hASC with 
PBMCs or monocytes but not with T cells. IL-10 blockade 
partially reversed the inhibitory activity of hASC on T cells. 
Modifications in MSCs decrease or enhance their immuno￾modulatory effects (45–47). Duijvestein et al. recently showed 
that IFN-γ-stimulated MSCs (IMSCs), but not nonstimulated 
MSCs, showed a significantly attenuated DSS-induced coli￾tis and trinitro-benzene sulfunate–induced colitis. Human 
MSCs significantly inhibited PBMC proliferation at lower 
PBMC:IMSC ratios compared with untreated MSCs, indicat￾ing that IMSCs have higher immunomodulatory capacities. 
Treatment with mouse IMSCs resulted in significantly lower 
serum amyloid A levels, confirming the decreased inflamma￾tory responses observed in these animals. IMSC migration to 
the intestine was significantly increased during colitis induc￾tion, whereas MSC distribution was unaffected, suggesting 
that IMSCs gain homing potential to sites of inflammation 
(45). Ko et al. recently showed that when cells were coated with 
antiaddressin antibody and injected into C57BL6 mice with 
DSS-induced colitis, the mice showed dramatically improved 
survival rates, higher IBD therapeutic scores, and significantly 
improved body weight gain compared with mice injected with 
MSC-only, isotype Ab, free Ab plus MSCs, or vehicle-only con￾trols (46). hASC-treated colitic mice had significantly higher 
numbers of T regulatory cells (Tregs) in mesenteric lymph 
nodes than untreated colitic mice, and they persisted for a 
long period of time. In vivo depletion of IL-10 or CD25+ T 
cells partially reversed the beneficial action of hASCs on coli￾tis, demonstrating involvement of a therapeutic effect. When 
cells were coated with antibody against vascular cell adhesion 
molecule-1 (Ab VCAM-1-MSC), mice exhibited a percentage 
of Tregs nearly five times greater than with PBS-only-injected 
mice (analysis of variance, P < 0.0001), whereas MSC-only￾injected mice showed nearly a tripling of the Treg percentage 
compared with PBS-injected mice (P < 0.05; ref. 46).
Colons of hASC-treated mice contained reduced levels 
of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-1β, and 
IL-12), chemokines (RANTES), and macrophage inflamma￾tory protein-2 and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory/
regulatory cytokine IL-10 in comparison with untreated 
DSS colitic mice. This effect was not just a consequence of a 
diminished inflammatory infiltration in the mucosa because 
mononuclear cells isolated from the lamina propria of hASC￾treated mice produced less TNF-α, IL-12, and IFN-γ on ex 
vivo culture, suggesting that hASC deactivated the colonic 
inflammatory response (44). Both syngeneic and allogeneic 
murine ASCs were as efficient as hASCs in ameliorating the 
colitis suggesting that the immunosuppressive action of ASCs 
is non–major histocompatibility complex (MHC)–restricted 
and that the infused ASCs are immune-tolerated by the host, 
which is convenient for future clinical application of these cells 
in CD (44).
Cellular Therapy Clinical Trials in Cd
The results of human trials in CD are summarized in Table 1
(4,48–53). Cellular therapy can be divided into HSC therapy 
and MSC therapy. HSC therapy can be subdivided into autolo￾gous vs. allogenic; similarly, MSC therapy is subdivided into 
local vs. systemic in addition to allogenic vs. autologous.
Hsc Therapy
In 1995, an international committee developed guidelines on 
entry criteria and transplant protocols for severe autoimmune 
diseases and IBD. The committee recommended that autologous 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) be preferred 
to allogeneic HSCT because of the lower risk of severe toxicity 
(54). Apart from case reports, two series have reported success 
of autologous HSCT for CD as the primary indication (55,56). 
All the case reports or series have used high-dose cyclophos￾phamide with G-CSF for mobilization of HSCs and high-dose 
cyclophosphamide ± ATG (equine or rabbit) as a preparative 
regimen with autologous stem cell infusion. The first phase I 
study from Chicago included 12 patients with active moder￾ate to severe CD refractory to conventional therapies includ￾ing anti-TNF treatment. Eleven of 12 patients entered a sus￾tained remission after a median follow-up of 18.5 mo. Only 1 
patient had developed recurrence of active CD (48). Another 
study published from Milan in 2008 included 4 patients. All 
had failed immunosuppressant treatment including anti-TNF 
therapy, and 2 had undergone multiple surgical resections. 
All had active CDAI of 258–404 at the time of transplanta￾tion. Three months after transplant, all patients had achieved 
clinical remission and complete endoscopic remission was 
achieved in 2 of 3 patients. Three of the 4 patients had sus￾tained remission after a median follow-up of 16.5 mo. No mor￾tality was observed in the two series (49). Currently, a phase 
III study originating from Nottingham, UK, is recruiting CD 
patients. The study is testing the role of early vs. late autologous 
HSCT in the treatment of refractory CD (http://clinicaltrials.
gov/ct2/show/NCT00297193). Allogenic marrow transplan￾tation has also proven to be useful for the treatment of IBD. 
In 11 patients who underwent allogenic marrow transplanta￾tion with myeloablative conditioning, at a median follow-up 
of 34 mo all 10 surviving patients were in complete remission 
of their hematologic malignancy and free of IBD symptoms, 
despite discontinuation of the usual immunosuppressive drugs 
after allogenic HSCT (50). A similar observation was made in a

Review Dalal et al.
study by McDonald et al., from Seattle, in which 4 of 5 patients 
followed for 4.5 to 15.3 y after allogeneic HSCT for hematolog￾ical malignancies with myeloablative conditioning regimen, 
remained free of CD without immunosuppressive therapy. 
Normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase levels was noted 
in 2 of 3 patients with a clinical diagnosis of sclerosing cho￾langitis (51). Since the report in 1993 of the first CD patient 
who underwent autologous HSCT for lymphoma resulting in 
improvement of CD, at least 25 patients have been reported 
who underwent HSCT for cancer, with remission achieved in 
22 cases, over a median follow-up of 20 mo. Two patients died 
from infectious complications (3). Unlike allogenic HSCT, 
recurrence of CD in transplanted bowel points toward a sig￾nificant role of the immune system rather than the mucosal 
barrier in the pathogenesis of CD (57).
Msc Therapy
Systemic Infusion of Human MSCs
In the first human trial of systemic MSCs in CD, Onken et al., 
from Duke University, treated 10 patients who had failed 
previous treatment with steroids and immunosuppressants 
and had active disease; patients were randomized to receive 
either low- (2 million cells/kg) or high-dose (8 million cells/
kg) i.v., allogenic, third-party, healthy, human bone marrow–
derived MSCs as i.v. infusions—in two doses 7 d apart. All 
nine evaluable patients had a decrease in CDAI score by day 
28. Mean CDAI scores decreased significantly from baseline to 
day 28 (341 vs. 236, P = 0.004, Wilcoxon signed rank). The pri￾mary end point was clinical response defined as a ≥100-point 
reduction in CDAI. This response was achieved in 3 patients 
(33%) by day 14, 2 of whom met the end point within 7 d of the 
first infusion. All clinical responders had previously failed inf￾liximab therapy. Mean IBD quotient scores increased signifi￾cantly from baseline to day 28 (113 vs. 146, P = 0.008, Wilcoxon 
signed rank). IBD quotient scores increased to ≥170 in 22% of 
patients by day 14 and 38% by day 28. There appeared to be an 
association between mean change in IBD quotient and clinical 
response at day 28 (P = 0.07, Wilcoxon rank sum). Although 
not statistically significant, the mean reduction in the CDAI 
score at day 28 was greater in the high-dose than in the

Role of MSC therapy in Crohn’s disease Review
low-dose group (−137 vs. −65, P = 0.39, Wilcoxon rank sum). 
All infusions were well tolerated, and there were no treatment￾related serious adverse events58).
Another phase I study of autologous bone marrow–
derived MSCs for luminal refractory CD was published in 
the Netherlands. Enough MSCs were expanded in 9 of 10 
patients to administer two doses of 1–2 × 106
 cells/kg body 
weight, intravenously, 7 d apart. All patients had previously 
failed corticosteroids, at least two anti-TNF drugs, and 9 of 10 
patients also had failed two immunosuppressants (thiopurine 
and methotrexate). In this study, no clear signal of efficacy was 
observed; remission was not achieved in any patient, and 3 
patients had a reduction of at least 70 points in CDAI, but the 
disease worsened significantly in 4 patients requiring surgery 
(three cases) or rescue medication (one case) within 14wk 
after cell treatment. Endoscopy improved in two cases, but 
no significant changes in C-reactive protein levels were seen 
(52). The currently ongoing largest, randomized, placebo-con￾trolled, double-blind phase III study of prochymal (allogenic 
marrow–derived MSCs) in CD was initiated in 2007 by Osiris 
(http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00294112). The study 
plan is to enroll 270 patients with active CD (CDAI 250–450) 
who have a history of treatment failure with or intolerance to 
steroids, immunosuppressants, and biologics. Patients are ran￾domized to receive four infusions over 2wk of either 600 mil￾lion cells (low dose: two infusions of 200 × 106
 hMSCs in week 
1, then two infusions of 100 × 106
 hMSCs in week 2), 1,200 
million cells (high dose: two infusions of 400 × 106
 hMSCs 
in week 1, then two infusions of 200 × 106
 hMSCs in week 2) 
or placebo. The primary end point of the study is remission 
at day 28 with secondary end points being clinical response, 
improved quality of life (increased IBD quotient score), and 
decreased number of draining fistulae.
Local Injection of Mscs in Cd
The first trial of cell therapy using autologous MSCs (ASCs) 
obtained from a lipoaspirate for local treatment of fistulae for 
CD in 5 patients was published in 2005 (19). The same group 
published a phase II, multicenter, randomized controlled trial 
describing the effectiveness and safety of ASCs in the treat￾ment of complex perianal fistulas in 2009. Patients with com￾plex perianal fistulas (cryptoglandular origin, n = 35; associ￾ated with CD, n = 14) were randomly assigned to intralesional 
treatment with fibrin glue or fibrin glue plus 20 million ASCs. 
Fistula healing and quality of life (SF-12 questionnaire) were 
evaluated at 8wk and 1 y. If healing was not seen at 8wk, a 
second dose of fibrin glue or fibrin glue plus 40 million ASCs 
was administered. Fistula healing was observed in 17 (71%) of 
24 patients who received ASCs in addition to fibrin glue, com￾pared with 4 (16%) of 25 patients who received fibrin glue alone 
(relative risk for healing, 4.43; confidence interval, 1.74–11.27; 
P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with healing was similar 
in CD and non-CD subgroups. ASCs were also more effective 
than fibrin glue alone in patients with a suprasphincteric fis￾tulous tract (P = 0.001). Quality-of-life scores were higher in 
patients who received ASCs than in those who received fibrin 
glue alone. At 1-y follow-up, the recurrence rate in patients 
treated with ASCs was 17.6%. Both treatments were well toler￾ated (53). In a second study, published recently, a local injec￾tion of autologous marrow–derived MSCs was given to nine 
patients with perianal and one patient with enterocutaneous 
fistulas. Injections of a median of 20 × 106
 cells (range 15–30) 
were given every 4wk until a response was obtained or no 
more cells were available. Complete fistula closure sustained 
for 1 y was obtained in 7 patients and a response (reduction of 
at least 50% of fistula tracts) in 3. Furthermore, all 9 patients 
with perianal fistulas had active disease in the rectum at base￾line, and healing of rectal lesions was observed in the 7 patients 
who underwent endoscopy at month 12 of follow-up. Thus, the 
latter study suggests a considerable therapeutic benefit of local 
injection of MSCs in fistulizing lesions (4). At this stage, rea￾sons for the apparent discrepancies between efficacy of local 
injection of MSCs for treatment of fistulas compared with 
systemic administration for treatment of luminal CD are not 
completely clear. MSCs have been reported to home to sites 
of injury and disease following i.v. infusion and contribute to 
the repair process. The expression of adhesion molecules and 
chemokine receptors on MSCs may be responsible for their 
ability to migrate selectively to sites of inflammation through 
a ICAM1- and VCAM1-dependent interaction with endothe￾lial cells (59). In an experimental model of colitis, systemically 
injected human adipose tissue–derived MSCs were detected in 
the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen of the recipient colitic 
mice 1–3 d post injection (44). Interestingly, labeled MSCs 
were recruited by the inflamed colon but not by the nonin￾flamed intestine. However, the proportion of cells recruited to 
inflamed or damaged organs and the survival of cells at sites 
of inflammatory lesions remain to be clarified, a necessary 
prerequisite for optimizing a potential systemic treatment. In 
studies showing efficacy of local injections, of human autolo￾gous MSCs, 30–60 × 106
 are injected in a single fistulous tract, 
and these injections are generally repeated (4,53). In a study 
using systemic injection for treatment of luminal disease, a 
higher number of 100–400 × 106
 allogenic or autologous MSCs 
were injected (52). Considering the extension of the inflamed 
intestine, and the fact that only a portion of the MSCs will 
reach the inflamed organ, the cell density at sites of luminal 
inflammation would be considerably lower than that achieved 
in fistula tracts by local injection. To circumvent this, Ghosh et 
al., from the United Kingdom, injected haploidentical MSCs 
after catheterization of the mesenteric artery via the femoral 
route into a 35-y-old patient with severe refractory fistulizing 
CD failing all conventional therapies, biological therapies, and 
surgical defunctioning ileostomy. The patient received 105
/kg 
MSCs, and 4wk later a second dose of 106
/kg (60). The pre￾treatment CDAI was 384; it dropped to 258 2 weeks after the 
first infusion and remained as such at the time of the second 
infusion administered after 4wk. Magnetic resonance imag￾ing of the abdomen/pelvis post–MSC treatment showed slight 
changes in the transphincteric fistulae on the right and an 
unchanged horseshoe intersphincteric extension on the left 
side. There was no adverse effect. All the above studies point

to a difference in cell density achieved at inflammatory sites, 
with systemic and local injections. Ongoing trials are testing 
fourfold higher systemic doses (61).
Timing of Msc Treatment
A recent study published by Duijvestein et al. showed that 
azathioprine, methotrexate, and anti-TNF compounds do not 
change the phenotype, morphology, viability, differentiation, 
and functional capabilities when incubated with MSCs in phys￾iological concentrations. Conversely, the presence of MSCs did 
not hamper the immunosuppressive effect of those commonly 
used medications for treatment of CD (62). In another recent 
study examining the mechanism of various anti-TNF medica￾tions, Vos et al. found that anti-TNF antibodies differentiate 
blood-derived macrophage into regulatory phenotype (Mφind) 
in an FC fragment-dependent fashion. The Mφind phenotype 
has anti-inflammatory properties because it inhibits the pro￾liferation of activated T cells, produces IL-10, and expresses 
regulatory macrophage marker CD206 (63). Similarly, MSCs 
can turn macrophages into the regulatory phenotype, raising 
the possibility of synergism (64). All of the above make MSC 
treatment very attractive for use with standard CD therapy to 
enhance induction and then, in maintenance, to enable more 
rapid tapering of immunosuppressive therapy.
Conclusion
Many human trials of autologous and allogenic MSCs com￾pleted in the past 5–6 y have demonstrated both short-term 
safety and efficacy of that modality of cellular therapy for CD 
and acute graft-vs.-host disease. There is an apparent discrep￾ancy in response to MSC therapy for CD based on route of 
administration (i.v. vs. intralesional vs. intra-arterial). The rea￾son for this is speculative, but it might reflect the density of 
the injected cells at the lesion site. Ongoing trials with higher 
doses may help in answering this question. Trials of allogenic 
MSCs derived from bone marrow in children with CD should 
be initiated soon to test that modality for use in children 
because they may respond better than adults. Many challenges 
remain ahead, including determining the best source of MSCs, 
the best administration route, and the density of cells needed at 
the lesion site to guarantee effective therapy. It will be particu￾larly important to determine which combinations, including 
biologics, are more effective in the treatment of CD.
