Abstract
Background: Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity
and even some mortality. The adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous
abdominal surgical procedures. The present paper presents a revised version of the Bologna guidelines to evidence￾based diagnosis and treatment of ASBO. The working group has added paragraphs on prevention of ASBO and special
patient groups.
Methods: The guideline was written under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery by the ASBO
working group. A systematic literature search was performed prior to the update of the guidelines to identify relevant
new papers on epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ASBO. Literature was critically appraised according to an
evidence-based guideline development method. Final recommendations were approved by the workgroup, taking
into account the level of evidence of the conclusion.

Recommendations: Adhesion formation might be reduced by minimally invasive surgical techniques and the use of
adhesion barriers. Non-operative treatment is effective in most patients with ASBO. Contraindications for non-operative
treatment include peritonitis, strangulation, and ischemia. When the adhesive etiology of obstruction is unsure,
or when contraindications for non-operative management might be present, CT is the diagnostic technique of
choice. The principles of non-operative treatment are nil per os, naso-gastric, or long-tube decompression, and
intravenous supplementation with fluids and electrolytes. When operative treatment is required, a laparoscopic
approach may be beneficial for selected cases of simple ASBO.
Younger patients have a higher lifetime risk for recurrent ASBO and might therefore benefit from application of
adhesion barriers as both primary and secondary prevention.
Discussion: This guideline presents recommendations that can be used by surgeons who treat patients with
ASBO. Scientific evidence for some aspects of ASBO management is scarce, in particular aspects relating to
special patient groups. Results of a randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open surgery for ASBO are awaited.
Keywords: Small bowel obstruction, Adhesions, Surgery, Laparoscopy, Laparotomy
Background
Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the
leading causes of surgical emergencies and in particular
of surgical emergencies that require an emergent opera￾tions [1–4]. In the UK, small bowel obstruction was the
indication for 51% of all emergency laparotomies [2].
Scott et al. reported on seven emergency surgical proce￾dures that account for 80% of all general surgery emer￾gency admissions, morbidity, deaths, and healthcare
expenditures in the USA [3]. Adhesive small bowel ob￾struction was the most common diagnosis for both the
top 2 (small bowel resection) and top 5 (adhesiolysis)
procedures [3]. Post-operative adhesions are the leading
cause of small bowel obstructions, accounting for 60% of
cases [1].
ASBO causes considerable harm, resulting in 8 days of
hospitalization on average and an in-hospital mortality
rate of 3% per episode [5–8]. Between 20 and 30% of pa￾tients with adhesive small bowel obstruction require op￾erative treatment [1, 9–11]. Length of hospitalization and
morbidity depend on the need for surgical intervention.
Average hospitalization after surgical treatment of ASBO
is 16 days, compared to 5 days following non-operative
treatment [12]. Associated costs in a Dutch study in 2016
were estimated at €16,305 for surgical and €2227 for
non-operative treatment [12].
Although adhesive small bowel obstruction is a com￾mon condition, the prevention and treatment is often
characterized by surgeons’ personal preferences rather
than standardized evidence-based protocols. There is a
large amount of conflicting and low-quality evidence in
publications regarding treatment of adhesive small bowel
obstruction.
Therefore, the World Society of Emergency Surgery
(WSES) working group on ASBO has developed
evidence-based guidelines to support clinical decision
making in diagnosis and management of ASBO [11,
13]. In the present revision of these guidelines, all
recommendations were updated according to the lat￾est evidence available from the medical literature.
Further, we have introduced two new sections: pre￾vention of ASBO and special patient groups.
Methods
The guideline was written under the auspices of the WSES
by the ASBO working group. Systematic searches of the
MEDLINE and Embase databases were carried out in Octo￾ber 2016 using the keywords relevant to each section. Terms
relevant to each section of the guideline were mapped to
MEDLINE Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms, as
well as searched for as text items. Articles describing ran￾domized controlled trials and systematic reviews were
searched for using the methodological filters of the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (http://www.sign.ac.uk/
methodological-principles.html). The bibliographies of in￾cluded articles were subsequently hand-searched for other
relevant references, and experts in the field were asked if
they found any relevant reports missing.
Critical appraisal
Articles selected to support recommendations were
assessed using the levels of evidence as published by the
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of
Oxford (www.cebm.net; Table 1). Articles were classified
according to the type of article and individually assessed
for methodological quality using the GRADE method as
proposed by the GRADE working group. That working
group has developed a common, sensible, and transpar￾ent approach to grading the quality of evidence and
strength of recommendations (http://www.gradewor￾kinggroup.org). The main literature on which the con￾clusion for each relevant topic is based is stated with the
conclusion, accompanied by the level of evidence
(Table 2) [14, 15].
ten Broek et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018) 13:24 Page 2 of 13

Conclusion and recommendations are graded according
to the level of evidence from strong (“there is strong evi￾dence for,” level A) to weak (“we cannot be confident,”
level D). Recommendations were graded as strong recom￾mendations (level I) or weak recommendation or sugges￾tions (level II). Recommendations were considered strong
recommendations if there is sufficient evidence (level A or
B) demonstrating that the benefits of an intervention are
of clinical importance and clearly outweigh the harm of
the intervention. A concept guideline was sent to all in￾volved for comment and approval after which internal
consensus was reached between the members of the work￾ing group. Amendments were made based upon these
comments, leading to the final version of this updated
guideline.
Definitions
Peritoneal adhesions
The term “peritoneal adhesions” or simply “adhesions” is
defined as fibrous tissue that connects surfaces or organs
within the peritoneal cavity that are normally separated.
Such adhesions are the results of a pathological healing
response of the peritoneum upon injury, as opposed to
the normal “ad integrum” repair [16]. Typical adhesions
form after peritoneal injury from abdominal surgery.
Other conditions that may cause peritoneal injury result￾ing in adhesion formation include radiotherapy, endo￾metriosis, inflammation, and local response to tumors.
Adhesions from a non-operative etiology are often part
of a more complex pathology that can cause chronic
pain and complications as the result of adhesions and
other mechanisms [17]. Management of chronic abdom￾inal complications by adhesiolysis is controversial [18,
19]. The scope of the present guideline is limited to
diagnosis and management of acute bowel obstructions.
Adhesive small bowel obstruction
Small bowel obstruction is a surgical emergency in which
the obstruction of the small intestine hinders passage of
intestinal contents. Small bowel obstruction is character￾ized by abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and consti￾pation. Adhesions are the single most common cause for
small bowel obstruction [1, 20]. Nonadhesive etiologies of
bowel obstruction include incarcerated hernias, obstruct￾ive lesions (malignant and benign), and a number of infre￾quent causes for bowel obstruction such as bezoars,
inflammatory bowel disease, and volvulus [21–25]. Defini￾tive confirmation of the adhesive etiology of bowel ob￾struction is made during operative treatment. Methods to
confirm the adhesive etiology of bowel obstruction
non-invasively include a history of previous episodes of
bowel obstruction by adhesions or exclusion of other
causes of bowel obstruction by imaging (often CT scan).
Adhesiolysis
Adhesiolysis refers to releasing adhesions either by blunt
or sharp dissection during surgery. It can be the primary
indication for an operation, as in a reoperation for small
bowel obstruction caused by adhesions. Adhesiolysis is
also performed during reoperations for indications not

related to adhesions in order to obtain sufficient access
to the operative field. Complicated adhesiolysis refers to
the event of inadvertent injury while performing adhe￾siolysis. Injuries during adhesiolysis are most frequently
made to the bowel. These bowel injuries are classified
as:
– Seromuscular injury: injury to the visceral peritoneum
(serosa) and smooth muscle layer of the bowel. The
lumen of the bowel or leakage of bowel contents is
not visible.
– Enterotomy: a full thickness injury to the bowel. The
mucous layer or lumen of the bowel is visible, or
there may be leakage of intestinal contents.
– Delayed diagnosed perforation: bowel injuries made
during surgery that initially go unrecognized. Typically,
the abdomen is closed at the end of procedure with
the bowel injury still in place, causing patients to
deteriorate during the postoperative course.
Results
Epidemiology
The risk of SBO is highest following colorectal, onco￾logic gynecological, or pediatric surgery [1, 26–28]. One
in ten patients develops at least one episode of SBO
within 3 years after colectomy [7]. Reoperations for
ASBO occur in between 4.2 and 12.6% of patients after
pediatric surgery patients, and 3.2% of colorectal pa￾tients [1, 29]. Recurrence of ASBO is also frequent; 12%
of non-operatively treated patients are readmitted within
1 year, rising to 20% after 5 years. The risk of recurrence
is slightly lower after operative treatment: 8% after 1 year
and 16% after 5 years [30].
Classification of adhesions
The most frequently used classification of adhesions in
general surgery is the adhesion score according to
Zühlke et al. (Table 3) [31]. The score is based on the
tenacity and some morphologic aspects of the adhesions.
The merits of this score are that it is easy to use and
classifications are self-explanatory to most surgeons and
gynecologists. The major drawback to the score is that it
does not measure the extent of adhesions and that
tenacity of adhesions can vary between different parts of
the abdomen. The most used grading system in
gynecological surgery is the American Fertility Society
(AFS) score [32]. The score is designed for grading adhe￾sions in the small pelvis. Adhesions are scored for extent
and severity at four sites: right ovary, right tube, left
ovary, and left tube. The scores for the right and left side
are summed, and the final AFS score is the score for the
side with the lowest summed score while discarding the
score for the other side. Thus, a patient with an AFS
score of 0 can still have adhesions. Further critiques for
this score include a relatively low inter-observer repro￾ducibility [33]. A modified AFS has therefore gained
popularity in more recent studies [34].
A recently introduced score by the ASBO working
group is the peritoneal adhesion index (PAI), which mea￾sures tenacity on a 1–3 scale at 10 predefined sites, to in￾tegrate tenacity and extent of adhesions in a single score
(Fig. 1) [35]. This score is the only score that has been val￾idated to be prognostic for convalescence after surgery for
ASBO and the risk of injuries during adhesiolysis [36]. A
limitation to all these adhesion scores is that they are only
applicable to operative cases because they require opera￾tive assessment. Furthermore, none of them has yet been
validated to correlate with the long-term risk for (recur￾rence of ) adhesion-related complications.
A different type of classification in the field of ASBO
is risk stratification that predicts the need for surgery.
Zielinski reported on three radiological and clinical signs
that correlate with the need for surgical exploration:
Table 3 Classification of adhesions according to Zühlke et al.
Grade 0 No adhesions or insignificant adhesions
Grade 1 Adhesions that are filmy and easy to separate by blunt dissection
Grade 2 Adhesions where blunt dissection is possible but some sharp
dissection necessary, beginning vascularization
Grade 3 Lysis of adhesions possible by sharp dissection only, clear
vascularization
Grade 4 Lysis of adhesions possible by sharp dissection only, organs
strongly attached with severe adhesions, damage of organs

mesenteric edema, absence of the small-bowel feces sign,
and obstipation. The score was validated in 100 cases of
ASBO and predicted the risk with a concordance index
of 0.77 [37]. A more accurate model was reported by
Baghdadi et al. This score comprises radiological find￾ings, sepsis criteria, and comorbidity index. Although
the score is somewhat complex to assess, it correlates
with an area under the curve of 0.80 in a validation
study of 351 cases [38].
Prevention
Surgical technique
The main principles of prevention of adhesion and re￾lated complications are minimizing surgical trauma and
the use of adjuvants to reduce adhesion formation.
Laparoscopy is often believed to reduce adhesion forma￾tion and the risk for ASBO. In a systematic review of co￾hort studies, the incidence of reoperation for ASBO was
1.4 (95% CI 1.0–1.8%) after laparoscopic and 3.8% (95%
CI 3.1–4.4%) after open surgery. However, there were
differences in both the type and indications for surgery
[1]. In a recent meta-analysis of SBO after colorectal op￾erations, the incidence of ASBO after laparoscopic sur￾gery was somewhat lower than after open colorectal
procedures (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72). However, no
significant difference was found in the three randomized
trials included in this review (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to
1.2) [39]. In summary, there is some evidence that the
incidence of ASBO is lower after laparoscopy. However,
the effect seems modest when correcting for type and
indication of surgery. Thus, performing (colorectal) sur￾gery by laparoscopy is not a complete solution to pre￾venting adhesive SBO.
Many other aspects of surgical technique have been
associated with adhesion formation, although there are
little or no epidemiological data concerning their impact
on the incidence of ASBO. Nevertheless, a number of
important risk factors for aggravated adhesion formation
are worth considering. One of the most important risk
factors is the foreign body reaction, for example as seen
with starch-powdered gloves, and meshes used for ab￾dominal wall reconstruction [40, 41]. The choice of en￾ergy device might also impact adhesion formation.
Peritoneal injury is lower in bipolar electrocautery and
ultrasonic devices as compared to monopolar electro￾cautery [42, 43]. Animal data suggest that both systemic
and intraperitoneal application of antibiotics, and metro￾nidazole in particular, can reduce adhesion formation in
septic conditions [44, 45].
Adhesion barriers
Adhesion barriers are adjuvants for peritoneal adminis￾tration that can effectively reduce adhesion formation.
Adhesion barriers are produced in several forms: solid
membranes, gels, and liquids. The concept behind bar￾riers is that they do not actively interfere with inflamma￾tion and wound healing. Rather, they act as a spacer
which separates injured surfaces of the peritoneum,
allowing these surfaces to heal without forming fibrinous
attachments which eventually lead to adhesions. In order
to accomplish this task, such barriers should ideally be
inert to the human immune system and be slowly
degradable.
There is moderate evidence that a hyaluronate car￾boxymethylcellulose adhesion barrier can reduce the in￾cidence of reoperations for ASBO in colorectal surgery.
In three trials involving 1132 patients undergoing colo￾rectal surgery, hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose re￾duced the incidence of reoperations for adhesive small
bowel obstruction (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28–0.88) [46–48].
The use of such barriers seems cost-effective in open
colorectal surgery [49]. An overview of common used
adhesion barriers and their efficacy is found in Table 4.

Secondary prevention
Adhesion barriers might also be useful to prevent recur￾rence after surgical treatment of ASBO. One randomized
trial with an adhesion barrier included patients undergo￾ing surgery for ASBO [20]. In this trial, patients were ran￾domized to a liquid 4% icodextrin adhesion barrier or
standard operative treatment without an adhesion barrier.
The ASBO recurrence rate was 2.19% (2/91) in the ico￾dextrin groups versus 11.11% (10/90) in the control group
after a mean follow-up period of 41.4 months (p < 0.05)
[20]. In this trial, the barrier was applied in patients
treated for ASBO by laparotomy. However, the icodextrin
4% adhesion barrier can also be administered in laparo￾scopic surgery. Other trials with icodextrin as an adhesion
barrier indicated that it actually might not be the most po￾tent barrier to prevent adhesion reformation, which is typ￾ically more challenging than prevention of de novo
adhesions [50]. Favoring the use of icodextrin are its low
costs and good safety record [51]. From the results of
other trials, we suggest that a hyaluronate carboxymethyl￾cellulose might be more efficacious, but this barrier is less
practical in laparoscopic surgery [46–48, 52].
Approach to the patient with ASBO
An algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic ap￾proach to the patient with ASBO is presented in Fig. 2.
The initial diagnosis of ASBO is of utmost importance.
Failure to diagnose or having a delayed diagnosis repre￾sents 70% of malpractice claims in ASBO [53, 54].
The primary goals in the initial evaluation of patients in
whom adhesive small bowel obstruction is suspected are:
– Differentiating between adhesive small bowel
obstruction and other causes of bowel obstruction
– Assessing the need for urgent surgical exploration
– Identifying and preventing complications from
bowel obstruction
History taking and physical examination
History taking in a patient suspected for ASBO includes
assessment of potential causes of bowel obstruction (pre￾vious operations, radiotherapy) and nutritional status.
Signs of dehydration should also be assessed. Tradition￾ally, ASBO is clinically diagnosed in a patient with inter￾mittent colicky abdominal pain, distention, and nausea
(with or without vomiting), with or without absence of
stools. Although diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is
fairly certain in a patient in whom all of these symptoms
are present, there are some specific pitfalls that can result
in delayed or misdiagnosis of bowel obstruction upon ini￾tial presentation. In patients with incomplete obstruction,
watery diarrhea may be present. The presence of watery
diarrhea can cause an episode of ASBO to be mistaken for
gastro-enteritis. Stools might also be present in patients
with a relatively high obstruction who are admitted early
after onset of symptoms. Moreover, not all of these symp￾toms may be present, especially in the elderly in whom
pain is often less prominent [55, 56].
During physical examination, signs of peritonitis that
might reveal strangulation or ischemia should be evalu￾ated. Differential diagnostic considerations that can be
assessed during physical examination include the presence
of any abdominal wall or groin hernias. The evaluation of
ASBO by history taking and physical examination has a
low sensitivity for detecting bowel strangulation and ische￾mia. Sensitivity of physical examination for detection of
strangulation is only 48%, even in experienced hands [57].
Laboratory tests
The minimum of laboratory tests include blood count,
lactate, electrolytes, CRP, and BUN/creatinine. Laboratory
values that might indicate peritonitis are a CRP > 75 and
white blood cell count > 10.000/mm3
, although sensitivity
and specificity of these tests are relatively low [6, 57, 58].
Electrolytes are often disturbed in patients with a bowel
obstruction; in particular, low values of potassium are fre￾quently found and need to be corrected. BUN/creatinine
needs to be assessed as patients with ASBO are frequently
dehydrated which could result in acute kidney injury.
Imaging studies
Plain X-rays
The value of plain X-rays complementary to physical
examination is limited. In high-grade obstruction, a triad
of multiple air-fluid levels, distention of small bowel
loops, and absence of gas in the colon are pathogno￾monic for small bowel obstruction, but overall sensitivity
and specificity of plain x-rays are low (sensitivity ap￾proximately 70%) [59, 60]. A large volume pneumoperi￾toneum secondary to bowel perforation in ASBO can
also be detected on plain X-rays, preferably by an erect
chest X-ray. Plain X-rays, however, do not detect the
more early signs of peritonitis or strangulation [59–61].
Furthermore, a plain abdominal X-ray does not provide
anatomical information that helps differentiate between
the various causes of bowel obstruction.
Water-soluble contrast studies
Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have estab￾lished the usefulness of water-soluble contrast agents in
the diagnostic work-up of ASBO [62–64]. If the contrast
has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray taken
24 h following administration of the contrast, this is highly
indicative of failure of non-operative management. Mul￾tiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble con￾trast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery and
reduces hospital stay [62, 63]. Some authors also suggest
that water-soluble contrast studies reduce the need for
ten Broek et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018) 13:24 Page 6 of 13

surgery, which is attributed to an active therapeutic role of
the contrast [62, 63].
CT scans
Current helical CT scans not only have good test character￾istics for diagnosing small bowel obstruction but also have
approximately 90% accuracy in predicting strangulation
and the need for urgent surgery [37, 60, 65–68]. Diagnostic
value of CT scan can be enhanced with the use of
water-soluble contract. As with water-soluble contrast stud￾ies, progress of the contrast can be evaluated by X-ray at
24 h after CT scan.
Although adhesions are not directly visible even on CT
scan, a CT scan can differentiate accurately between dif￾ferent causes of bowel obstruction by excluding other
causes. The workgroup therefore considers CT scan to be
Fig. 2 Algorithm to diagnosis and treatment of ASBO
ten Broek et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018) 13:24 Page 7 of 13

the preferred imaging technique if there is any doubt
about the diagnosis of ASBO, and to assess the need for
urgent surgery.
A CT scan should help to differentiate between a
complete obstruction of the bowel and help facilitate the
decision for a trial of non-operative management versus
a decision to proceed to surgery. It may also help to de￾fine the location of the obstruction (e.g., high in the je￾junum or deep in the pelvis). Signs of a closed loop,
bowel ischemia, and free fluid are signs that suggest the
need for surgery without delay. In addition, radiological
and clinical scores can be used to predict the need for
surgery as described above [37, 38].
Ultrasound and MRI
Although the working group considered CT scan to be the
preferred technique for diagnosis of ASBO, ultrasound
and MRI might be useful in specific situations. Ultrasound
is operator dependent but in experienced hands can pro￾vide more information than plain X-rays, and is also avail￾able in most low income settings. Apart from distension
of bowel loops, ultrasound enables detection of free fluid
(that might indicate the need for urgent surgery) and as￾sessment of the degree of shock in dehydrated patients
[61, 69]. Ultrasound can also be of value in situations in
which exposure to radiation is undesirable, such as in
pregnant patients. In these cases, ultrasound might be
complemented with MRI for more anatomical information
if the diagnosis of bowel obstruction is confirmed [70].
Diagnosis: summary
Recommendations can be found in Table 5. In summary,
CT scan with oral water-soluble contrast is the preferred
technique of imaging in the initial evaluation. Progress

Level IIC Plain X-rays have only limited value in the work-up of patients with small bowel obstruction and are not recommended.
B Maglinte 1996
Level IB Optimal diagnostic work-up should include CT scan in the assessment and water soluble oral contrast. In the absence of the need to
perform immediate surgery, a follow-up abdominal X-ray should be made after 24 h. If the contrast has reach the colon, this is indicative
for resolution of the bowel obstruction.

of the contrast should be monitored after 24 h of
non-operative treatment by X-ray. If the diagnosis of
ASBO is certain (e.g., because other causes have been
excluded with recent imaging), and there are no signs
that immediate surgery might be warranted, only a
water-soluble contrast study is considered sufficient.
Ultrasound and MRI can be useful in specific situations,
such as pregnancy or (in low income countries) when
CT scan is unavailable.
Management
Initial decision making
Non-operative management should always be tried in pa￾tients with adhesive small bowel obstruction, unless there
are signs of peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia
[71]. Although the risk of recurrence is slightly lower after
operative treatment, this is not a reason to opt for a pri￾mary surgical approach. Morbidity from emergency surgi￾cal exploration is high; there is a considerable risk for
bowel injury, and surgical treatment may significantly re￾duce post-operative quality of life [1, 72–74].
Non-operative management
The cornerstone of non-operative management is nil per
os and decompression using a naso-gastric tube or long
intestinal tube. Non-operative management is effective
in approximately 70–90% of patients with ASBO [1, 75,
76]. There has been some debate in the literature over
the use of long intestinal tubes or naso-gastric tubes. In
an older trial, no significant difference in failure rates
was found between naso-gastric tubes and long intes￾tinal tubes [77]. In a more recent trial, 186 patients were
randomized between a newly designed trilumen long
tube and a naso-gastric tube. Long tubes seemed more
effective in this trial with a failure rate of 10.4% in this
group compared with 53.3% in the naso-gastric tube
group [78]. Results from this trial should be interpreted
with care, because the failure rate of naso-gastric tube
compression is much higher than would be expected from
other literature. Moreover, a drawback of trilumen tubes
is the need for endoscopic placement. Non-operative
management should further include fluid resuscitation,
correction of electrolyte disturbances, nutritional support,
and prevention of aspiration.
Duration of the period in which non-operative man￾agement can be tried is subject to debate. Several retro￾spective series and databases have shown that delays in
surgery increase morbidity and mortality [30, 71, 79, 80].
Evidence for the optimal duration of non-operative treat￾ment is absent, but most authors and the panel consider
a 72-h period as safe and appropriate [11, 58, 76, 79, 80].
Continuing non-operative treatment for more than 72 h
in cases with persistent high output from a decompres￾sion tube, but no other signs of clinical deterioration,
however, remains subject to debate. Common medical
complications in patients with small bowel obstruction
are dehydration with kidney injury, electrolyte distur￾bances, malnutrition, and aspiration.
Non-operative management: summary
The panel recommends a trial of non-operative manage￾ment in all patients with ASBO, unless there are signs of
peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia. Evidence
for the optimal duration of non-operative is absent, but
most authors and the panel consider a 72-h period as
safe and appropriate. Further recommendations are
found in Table 5.
Operative treatment
Historically, abdominal exploration through laparotomy
has been the standard treatment for adhesive small
bowel obstruction. In recent years, however, laparo￾scopic surgery for ASBO has been introduced. The po￾tential benefits of laparoscopy include less extensive
adhesion (re)formation, earlier return of bowel move￾ments, reduced post-operative pain, and shorter length
of stay [81–83]. In a recent systematic review and
meta-analysis of 14 non-randomized studies, laparo￾scopic adhesiolysis reduced risk of morbidity, in-hospital
mortality, and surgical infections [84]. However, there
also seems strong selection bias in these series allocating
mainly the less severe cases to laparoscopy. In a ques￾tionnaire among surgeons, 60% of the respondents re￾ported to have performed laparoscopic adhesiolysis for
ASBO in their practice, but half of them in less than
15% of cases [11].
Although laparoscopy might provide some benefits to
some patients for ASBO, surgeons should carefully select
candidates for laparoscopic treatment. Laparoscopy in
an abdomen with very distended loops of bowel and
multiple complex adhesions could increase the risk of
severe complications such as enterotomies and delayed
diagnosis of perforations [85, 86]. Indeed, some authors
have reported bowel injury in 6.3 to 26.9% of patients
treated with laparoscopic adhesiolysis for ASBO [87–
89]. In a recent population-based study, bowel resections
were significantly more frequent in laparoscopic surgery.
Incidence of bowel resection was 53.5 versus 43.4% in
laparoscopic versus open procedures [90]. Farinella et al.
reported that predictors for a successful laparoscopic
treatment of ASBO are the following: ≤ 2 laparotomies
in history, appendectomy as the operation in history, no
previous median laparotomy incision, and a single adhe￾sive band [91]. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis also seems
more difficult in patients who have previously been
treated by radiotherapy [92].
More compelling evidence on the role of laparoscopy
in surgery for ASBO is from an ongoing randomized
ten Broek et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018) 13:24 Page 9 of 13

trial and is still awaited [93]. In this trial, strict inclusion
and exclusion criteria have been used to select candidates
in whom simple single band adhesions are expected.
Operative management: summary
Laparoscopic surgery has been introduced in recent years
and might decrease morbidity in subgroups of patients
undergoing surgery for ASBO. The risk of bowel injuries
seems higher in laparoscopic surgery for ASBO. Therefore,
careful selection of patients for laparoscopic surgery is re￾quired. Further recommendations are found in Table 5.
Special patient groups
Young patients
The risk of adhesion-related complications is life-long.
Although most small bowel obstructions will occur
within the first 2 years after surgery, new cases continue
to develop many years after the primary operation [1,
30, 72, 94, 95]. Also, the risk of requiring a future reop￾eration for unrelated causes is higher in younger patients
[96]. Pediatric patients, who are at the extreme of young
age, have a high risk for adhesion-related complications
[1]. In a recent cohort of patients who underwent sur￾gery at a pediatric age, the incidence of adhesive small
bowel obstruction was 12.6% after a median follow-up of
14.7 years [29].
Young patients therefore might have the highest life￾time benefit from adhesion prevention [49]. No trials
with adhesion barriers have been performed in pediatric
surgery, but a recent cohort study in pediatric patients
showed a significant reduction in ASBO with the use of
a hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose adhesion barrier
[97]. After a follow-up of 24 months, 2.0% of pediatric
patients operated with adhesion barrier versus 4.5% of
patients operated on without adhesion barrier developed
ASBO.
Elderly patients
In elderly patients, quality of life considerations are ex￾tremely important in decision making. Patients with a
high frailty index have a prolonged recovery after a sur￾gical procedure and may not be able to return to their
previous functional state and quality of life [98, 99].
The principles of treatment for adhesive small bowel
obstruction might interfere with comorbidities and
medication in the elderly patients. There is a marked
paucity of research on the consequences of stopping or
withholding oral medications when a patient is put on
nil per os for non-operative treatment of small bowel
obstruction. A recent cohort showed that patients with
diabetes might require earlier intervention although the
level of evidence is rather low. Patients with diabetes
were shown to suffer from a 7.5% incidence of acute kid￾ney injury and 4.8% incidence of myocardial infarction if
the operation was delayed more than 24 h [100]. The in￾cidence of these complications was significantly higher
when compared to diabetic patients that were operated
within 24 h and non-diabetic patients with delayed
operation.
Pregnancy
Small bowel obstruction in pregnancy is very rare but
represents an important clinical challenge with signifi￾cant risk of fetal loss. In a recent review, 46 cases of
bowel obstruction during pregnancy were found in lit￾erature from case series and case reports [101]. Approxi￾mately half of cases were attributed to adhesions, most
commonly from previous abdominal operations. Imaging
studies performed to diagnose SBO in the case reports
included ultrasound in ten cases (83%), abdominal X-ray
in four patients (33%), MRI in four patients (33%), and a
CT scan in three patients (25%). Strikingly, the failure
rate of non-operative treatment in pregnant patients
with ASBO was high. A total of 23 cases with ASBO
were reported, in 17 of whom initial management was
by a non-operative trial. Non-operative treatment failed
in 16 cases (94%). Risk of fetal loss was 17% (n = 8) and
risk of maternal death 2% (n = 1).
Conclusions
The conclusions and recommendations of this guideline
have been summarized in Table 5. ASBO is a common
surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and even
some mortality. Surgeons should be aware that the adhe￾sions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the
footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures or
disease. Part of the adhesion formation can be prevented
by application of minimal invasive surgical techniques
and the use of adhesion barriers. Most cases of ASBO
can be treated non-operatively. If operative treatment is
required, a laparoscopic approach might be beneficial for
simple cases. However, there is a considerable risk for
conversion to an open laparotomy and care needs to be
taken not to make bowel injury.
