Abstract
A 28 year old man with asthma, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,
pulmonary thromboembolic disease, and pulmonary hypertension
developed Aspergillus fumigatus empyema complicating a


pneumothorax. His condition progressively deteriorated despite
treatment with intravenous and intrapleural amphotericin B, but
improved promptly after substituting nebulised liposomal
amphotericin B and oral itraconazole. This experience suggests that
nebulised liposomal amphotericin B is well tolerated and merits
further assessment in the treatment of pulmonary fungal disease.
