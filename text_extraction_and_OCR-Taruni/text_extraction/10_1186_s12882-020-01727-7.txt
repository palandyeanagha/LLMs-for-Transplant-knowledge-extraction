Abstract
Background: Information about renal diseases in children is available from national registries of renal biopsies. Aim
of the study was to compare the clinical presentation of glomerular diseases and tubulointerstitial space diseases
with pathohistological diagnosis of indicated renal biopsies from pediatric population in the Croatian region of
Dalmatia.
Methods: Out of 231 pediatric patients with suspected glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases, 54 underwent
ultrasound-guided renal biopsy at University Hospital of Split. Kidney allograft biopsy, and re-biopsy were excluded.
The biopsy sections were examined under light microscopy, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The
data was reviewed to determine the pathohistological spectrum and clinicopathologic correlations. We
retrospectively analyzed kidney biopsy data from 2008 to 2017 and compared them to that between 1995 and
2005.
Results: The mean age of patients was 9.84 ± 5.4 years. Male:female ratio was 1.2:1. The main indications for biopsy
were pure nephrotic syndrome without hematuria (25.9%), non-nephrotic proteinuria with haematuria (22.2%), nephritic
syndrome with nephrotic proteinuria (18.5%), and isolated hematuria (16.7%). The most common pathohistological
findings were IgA nephropathy (IgAN, 24.1%), minimal change disease (MCD, 16.7%), Henoch-Schönlein purpura
glomerulonephritis (HSPN, 14.8%), Alport syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (AS and FSGS, 11.1%
each), tubulointerstitial nephritis and membranous glomerulopathy (TIN and MGN, 3.7% each), while other cases
were diagnosed rarely.
Conclusions: Changes in epidemiology of renal diseases in children between the analyzed periods showed an
increasing trend of IgAN, MCD, HSPN, AS and FSGS, while mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MesPGN) and
endoproliferative glomerulonephritis (EDGN) showed a decreasing trend that can be explained with the new
pathohistological classification.

Background
Renal diseases are very important as they significantly
contribute to morbidity of children. National registries
of renal biopsies showed a variety of renal diseases and
different epidemiology worldwide [1–6]. Renal biopsies
are still very important for renal diseases management in
children [7–22].
In our clinical experience we observed that the occur￾rence of certain glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases
changed in the last 10 years and also that the indication of
renal biopsies in children had changed. Therefore, the aim
of our study was to compare the clinical presentation of
glomerular diseases and tubulointerstitial space diseases
with pathohistological diagnosis of indicated renal biopsies
in the pediatric population. Here we present a summary of
clinico-pathological associations of kidney diseases world￾wide, in order to relate renal pathohistological diagnoses
(PHD) with our previous results regarding the period

between 1995 and 2005 [9]. We also analyzed changes in
epidemiological trends of kidney diseases and compared
them with the data from other national registries of kidney
biopsies in children. The differences between kidney dis￾eases in Croatia and data from other studies could be useful
in paediatrics for understanding the current state of chil￾dren’s renal pathology in south-eastern European countries
and a base for possible formation of a National Registry of
Renal Biopsies in Children in Croatia.
Methods
This retrospective study was conducted at University Hos￾pital of Split (UHC Split) at the Department of Pediatrics
in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Ethical Ap￾proval was granted from the Ethical Committee of UHC
Split. All patients with glomerular and tubulointerstitial
diseases admitted at the Department of Pediatric Nephrol￾ogy between 2008 and 2017 were evaluated (231 patients)
and indications for renal biopsies were determined by our
Department’s protocols. Kidney biopsy was performed
using an automated spring-loaded biopsy instrument
under ultrasound guidance. All biopsy samples were ana￾lyzed by light and immunofluorescence microscopy. The
polyclonal antisera were used against human IgG, IgA,
IgM, C1q, C3 and C4. All biopsies samples were analysed
by electron microscopy. Two experienced renal patholo￾gists examined all renal biopsies independently according
the WHO recommendations and Oxford classification in
cases of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) [23, 24]. No transplant
biopsies and re-biopsies were included in this study. There
have been several patients with multiple biopsies with the
same disease, but we included only data from the first
one. Additionally, all repeated biopsies happened during
the period of interest and they did not overlap in time
with the previously reported cohorts from period 1995–
2005. Patients who underwent renal biopsy were super￾vised for 48 h for possible complications. Various renal
clinical manifestations were analysed in regard to patho￾histological diagnosis (PHD).
Criteria for renal biopsy included: pure nephrotic syn￾drome without hematuria, non-nephrotic proteinuria with
hematuria, nephritic syndrome with nephrotic proteinuria,
isolated hematuria, acute renal failure, chronic renal fail￾ure, acute nephritic syndrome and non-nephrotic persist￾ent proteinuria as we described previously [9]. Arterial
hypertension in children was defined as average systolic or
diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to the 95th
percentile for age, gender and height.
Steroid therapy response was classified as; steroid sen￾sitive (SSNS), steroid dependent (SDNS) steroid resistant
(SRNS), frequently relapsing (FRNS), infrequently relaps￾ing (IFRNS), and complete remission (CRNS) [25–27].
The response to steroid therapy was classified as; steroid
sensitive (SSNS) (disappearance of proteinuria within 8
weeks of oral prednisone therapy at a dose of 60 mg/m2
/
day), steroid dependent (SDNS) (tendency to relapse
during prednisone therapy or within 2 weeks of discon￾tinuation), steroid resistant (SRNS) (a failure for remis￾sion to 8 consecutive weeks of treatment with oral
prednisone at 60 mg/m2
/day followed by 3 pulse doses
of methylprednisolone), frequently relapsing (FRNS) (2
or more relapses per 6 months of the initial response or
4 or more relapses per any 12-month), infrequently re￾lapsing (IFRNS) (less than 2 relapses per 6 months or
less than 4 relapses per any 12-month), remission (urin￾ary protein excretion < 4 mg/m2
/h) [25–27].
Statistical analysis
Chi-square test was used to determine statistical differ￾ences between the analyzed periods from 1995 to 2005,
and from 2008 to 2017 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA). Trends and breakpoints in time series were
analysed by jointpoint regression using BIC as model se￾lection criteria. Jointpoint regression was done in Join￾point Regression Program (Version 4.7.0.0. February,
2019; Statistical Research and Applications Branch, Na￾tional Cancer Institute, Calverton, MD, USA). If the
trend and breakpoint analysis of time series suggested
unsegmented linear model as the best, then a Poisson re￾gression was done to estimate the model coefficients;
Poisson regression was done in Past3 software. Statistical
significance was p < 0.05.
Results
Out of 231 patients with glomerular and tubulointersti￾tial diseases there were 54 (23.4%) patients (29 boys and
25 girls under 18 years of age) that had indication for
renal biopsy (Fig. 1, Table 1). At the time of biopsy, the
median age was 9.84 ± 5.4 years). The females had mean
age 9.84 ± 5.4 years and males 9.96 ± 4.9 years.
Indications for renal biopsy
Pure nephrotic syndrome without hematuria (NS) was
the most common reason for renal biopsy that presented
in 25.9% of cases. Non-nephrotic proteinuria with
hematuria was observed in 22.2% of biopsied cases.
Nephritic syndrome with nephrotic proteinuria was
found in 18.5%, and isolated hematuria was found in
16.7%. Acute renal failure was found in 7.4%, while
chronic renal failure was observed in 5.5% of biopsied
cases. Acute nephritic syndrome and non-nephrotic pro￾teinuria were relatively rare indications for renal biopsy
(Table 2).
Pathohistological analysis of all biopsied patients
Most of 54 biopsied cases underwent complete pathohis￾tological analysis. The relative distribution of renal dis￾eases diagnosed by biopsy is shown in Table 2.

The most common PHD-s were IgA nephropathy
(IgAN) (24.1%), followed by minimal change disease
(MCD) (16.7%). Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis
(HSPN) was present in 14.8% of cases. Focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Alport syndrome (AS)
were each found in 11.1% of cases. Tubulointerstitial
nephritis (TIN) and membranous glomerulopathy
(MGN) were each 3.7%. The one patient that had FSGS
also had TIN, while the one case with IgAN also had
thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). The
one patient with MCD additionally had TBMN. Other
cases were rarely diagnosed (Table 2).
In 8 (57.14%) out of 14 children with NS, biopsy was
done because of steroid dependence, in 4 (28.57%) because
of steroid resistance. One had infrequent relapses, while
one had complete remission (Table 3). Out of 8 patients
with SDNS, 7 (87.5%) had MCD, while one (12.5%) had
FSGS. In the group of 4 patients with SRNS, three (75%)
had FSGS and one (25%) had C1q nephropathy (C1qN).
When we combine data from patients with NS and
nephritic syndrome with nephrotic proteinuria we found
that out of 24 patients, there were 22 patients on steroid
therapy. Among them, 11 had SDNS, 6 CRNS, 4 had
SRNS, while 1 had IFRNS (Table 3).
The most common PHD-s included MCD (37.5%),
HSPN (20.8%), and FSGS (16.7%). The detailed distribu￾tions are shown in Table 4.
PHD-s in the group of NS
Among the 14 patients with NS, nine (64.28%) had
MCD, four patients (28.57%) had FSGS, while C1q ne￾phropathy was present in one (7.14%) case (Table 4).
Out of ten patients with nephritic syndrome with neph￾rotic proteinuria, five had HSPN, two (20.00%) had
MGN, two (20.00%) patients had IgAN, while AS was
present in one (10.00%) case (Table 4).
Out of 12 patients with non nephrotic proteinuria with
hematuria, five patients (41.66%) had IgAN, two (16.66%)
HSPN, two (16.66%) AS, one (8.33%) case of each, lupus
nephritis (LN), C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and focal seg￾mental necrotizing glomerulonephritis (FSNGN) (Fig. 2a).
Out of 9 children with persistent isolated hematuria,
IgAN was observed in 4 (44.44%) patients (one patient
with IgAN additionally had TBMN), AS was diagnosed
in three (33.33%), cases, while HSPN was found in one
(11.11%) case, as well as one (11.11%) case of TBMN.
Four children were presented with acute renal failure.
TIN was diagnosed in 2 of them, and other two diagno￾ses were crescentic GN and endoproliferative glomerulo￾nephritis (EDGN).
Three patients with chronic renal failure, had the fol￾lowing PHDs: IgAN in one patient, FSGS in other patient
while one patient had combination of FSGS and TIN.
In one patient with non-nephrotic proteinuria, mesan￾gial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MesPGN) was
found while in another patient with acute nephritic syn￾drome, IgAN was observed.
Complications of renal biopsy
Fourteen (26%) out of all 54 biopsies had clinically mild
complications, mostly macrohematuria (8), microhema￾turia (2) and subcapsular haematoma (4), observed by
ultrasonography, with no hemodynamic consequences,
and no need for blood transfusions.
Comparison of kidney biopsy results between 1995 and
2005 and 2008–2017
When we compared two time periods 1995–2005 and
2008–2017, changes in epidemiology of children renal
diseases displayed a significant increase of IgAN, MCD,
and AS (p < 0.05). On the contrary, there were no signifi￾cant differences noted in HSPN and FSGS frequencies.

MesPGN showed a significantly decreasing pattern (p <
0.05), while EDGN showed a decreasing trend although
not significantly (Fig. 2b). Between the years 1995–2005,
we have reported diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS), fi￾brillary glomerulonephritis (FG), renal vasculitis (RV),
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and
nephronophthisis, diagnoses that we did not during the
time period of 2008–2017. In contrast, in the last 10-
year period, we reported C1q nephropathy, FSNGN, C3
glomerulopathy and TBMN, diagnoses that we did not
have in the period between 1995 and 2005 (Fig. 2b).
When we analysed trends and breakpoints in whole
time series of relative frequencies for each pathological
entity from 1995 to 2017 few findings were noticed
(Fig. 3). Increasing linear trend of 0.43% +/− 0.04% per
year (p < 0.0001) was noticed for MCD. Similarly, IgAN
showed a linear increase of 0.18% +/− 0.06% per year
(p = 0.0059). Frequency of AS showed a sharp increase
in 2011. (95%CI:1997. to 2012.) and fall in 2015. (95%CI:
2013. to 2015.). HSPN time series showed a similar pat￾tern with a increase in 2011 (95%CI: 2005. to 2012.) and
fall in 2014 (95%CI: 2012. to 2015.). MesPGN showed a
steady increase of 3.51% +/− 1.08% per year (p = 0.005)
until year 2000. (95%CI: 1998 to 2002), afterwards fre￾quency of mesPGN is decreasing by 1.05% +/− 0.17% per
year (p < 0.0001).
Discussion
As in other similar studies, in our study there were
slightly more boys than girls [5, 11–13, 28–32], while
girls predominated only very rarely [16, 18]. The mean
age at biopsy was about 10 years, which is corresponding
to results reported in other countries [7–9, 11, 18, 22,
31]. However, sometimes that mean age was higher [15,
16] or lower [13, 28–30, 32].
Among 23 studies which have been analysed and com￾pared to our study, only 9 used a similar technique and
performed three different diagnostic techniques to￾gether: LM, IM and EM [1, 7, 9, 12, 17, 19, 22, 29, 33].
Eight studies did not used EM at all [11, 13, 16, 18, 20,
28, 30, 34], 5 used EM partly [2, 4, 6, 14, 15], while one
used both IM and EM only partly [8]. The described
technical heterogeneity could sometimes result in signifi￾cant differences in PHD-s.
Indications for renal biopsy
In accordance with the inclusion criteria, among the
total number of patients with glomerular and tubuloin￾terstitial diseases admitted to our Department during
the investigated period, renal biopsy was performed in
23.4% of cases. Contrary to our results, the study by
Fidan et al. reported kidney biopsy in about 10% of pa￾tients with renal diseases [3]. This difference might be
attributed to still unclear/different inclusion criteria. The
variations in indications for kidney biopsy can cause the
diversities of PHD-s among many groups of patients all
over of world. Therefore, comparison of PHD results
sometimes might be difficult, even impossible. More￾over, in some cases it is very difficult to compare results
of biopsies performed in the same centres during differ￾ent periods of time, due to changes of indications for bi￾opsy, methodology of tissue analysis, newly described
diseases, and new diagnostic classifications of kidney dis￾eases. The indications for renal biopsy seem to be quite
different among different countries [2, 5, 7–9, 11, 13, 15,
16, 18, 20, 22, 28].
The most frequent reason for renal biopsy in our re￾search, was NS (about one quarter). These results are
consistent with some studies from literature [2, 7–11,
13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 28], while in studies by Czech au￾thors isolated hematuria was the main indication [4, 6].

Nephrotic proteinuria with hematuria was the main indi￾cations in Morocco [20], while in the study by authors
from UK non-nephrotic proteinuria predominated with
36% of cases [10].
The reason for renal biopsy in NS group of patients re￾garding response to corticosteroid therapy gave predict￾able results due to the fact that we usually perform
biopsy in patients failed to reach complete remission
with corticosteroid therapy. The response to steroid
therapy in SDNS patients was well at the beginning, but
occasionally we needed to execute a renal biopsy due to
corticosteroid side effects or because of the need to use
another immunosuppressant. These findings are in cor￾relation to studies done by Paripović et al., Kanodia
et al., and Bazina et al. [9, 13, 16], while they differ from
results of Printza et al. [18] and Boyer et al. [33]. In con￾trast, Bircan et al. had a very wide scale of indications
for biopsy in patients with NS, with only 21.9% of SDNS,
13.2% of SRNS, and even 26.3% of patients with
complete remission of NS [35]. In our study, the second
indication for renal biopsy was non-nephrotic proteinuria
with hematuria, which is in accordance with some other
studies [1, 9, 22]. About one fifth of indications for renal
biopsy in our research was nephritic syndrome with
nephrotic proteinuria, which is significantly higher than
in our previous studies, where that category was com￾prised of 3.1% of all biopsied cases or 10.8% in the study
of Coppo et al. [2, 9].
Almost half of the indications for renal biopsy occur
with combination of NS and nephritic syndrome with
nephrotic proteinuria, which is mostly in line with previ￾ous studies [1, 9, 17]. In our study isolated hematuria
was the fourth indication for renal biopsy with 16.7% of
cases, which is slightly more than in our previous study
(12.3%) [9]. Coppo et al. [2] and Rychlík et al. [6] found
that isolated hematuria was the key indication for renal
biopsy in children. This may be true because indications
for renal biopsy in asymptomatic patients with micro￾scopic hematuria are debatable. Study of Zhai et al. [36]
suggests that isolated hematuria has relatively low risk of
severe pathohistological lesions and that long-term mon￾itoring is recommended, while Coppo et al. suggested
that kidney biopsy should be made promptly [2].
In our study, acute renal failure was a less important
reason for renal biopsy, while some studies reported
similar [7, 9, 11, 37], higher (10.7–17.5%) [2, 10, 18, 20],
or lower numbers (1.4–4.4%) [8, 15]. Similarly, chronic
renal failure, was also less important reason for renal bi￾opsy in our research.
By comparing different studies, we could show that in￾dications for renal biopsy have changed throughout
time. Thus, in the study of Yin et al., an increasing trend

of NS and decreasing trend of acute glomerulonephritis
(AGN), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
and isolated hematuria had been described [22], while
the study in Czech Republic displayed an increase of iso￾lated haematuria and decrease of NS as a reason for
renal biopsy [4]. Comparison of our two studies [2]
showed almost the same percentages of NS and AGN,
there was a modest increase of isolated hematuria and a
decrease of non- nephrotic proteinuria as the indication
for renal biopsy during that period.
The most common PHD diagnosis in our research was
IgAN. These findings are similar to study done by
Coppo et al. [2] and others [5, 6, 12, 21]. Contrary to
our results, some studies found lower frequency of IgAN
[1, 3, 8–10, 13–16, 18, 20, 34] or had not mentioned
IgAN at all [28].
The reason for such differences could be the fact that
IM was used in some studies only “when indicated” [8]
or when the IgAN was expected [28]. MCD in our re￾search, was the second most common PHD, while other
authors found MCD as the first indication [5, 8, 11, 14,
20, 34]. The reason for this finding might by extensive
indications for renal biopsy in NS in cimparison to our
Hospital. FSGS was the most frequent PHD in Turkey,
Greece and Serbia, probably due to stricter renal biopsy
indications in NS patients in those countries [3, 16, 18].
In addition, biopsy practice in England showed that
HSPN was the most common PHD (15.9%) [10], while
MesPGN was the most frequent PHD in Southern
Croatia in the period from 1995 to 2005 [9]. Those dif￾ferences in PHD-s probably come from a different atti￾tude towards patients with renal diseases, different
indications for renal biopsy, possible different diagnostic
methods of tissue analysis, and use of different pathohis￾tological classifications.
MCD was the most common pathohistological finding
in NS group of patients, and FSGS was the next. This is
in agreement with other national studies [2, 4, 6, 7, 33].
The possible explanation for differences in PHD ranging
could be the different policy towards renal biopsy in pa￾tients with NS. Therefore, in some countries renal bi￾opsy indications are strict and renal biopsy is not an
option when there is a response to corticosteroids.
PHD-s regarding the response to corticosteroid therapy in
the patients with NS
Our study showed that SDNS had MCD as PHD in
about 90% of patients, and the remaining had FSGS.
This might be attributed the hypothesis that if a patient
responds to corticosteroids there is no indication for
renal biopsy. In the group of our patients with SRNS,
FSGS was the PHD in 75% of cases. High percentage of
FSGS was also described by Kanodia et al. [13] and in
the Greek study by Printza et al. [18]. Those results
could be expected in view of the fact that these PHD-s
are poorly treatable with corticosteroids.
In our research, IgAN was the most usual PHD, in the
group of 12 patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria with
hematuria. This finding was similar to findings reported
in Japan [2, 38].
In the group of nephritic syndrome with nephrotic pro￾teinuria from our study, 50% of PHD-s were HSPN,
while Moorani et al. [28] and Zhou et al. found different
distribution of PHD-s [32].
When we combined MCD, HSPN, and FSGS, these
were the most frequent PHDs in our research. Contrar￾ily, Zhou et al. found MesPGN, FSGS, IgAN as the most
frequent PHDs [32]. However, those two studies are not
comparable because in the study by Zhou et al. method￾ology for tissue analysis has not been mentioned at all.
PHD-s in the group of patients with isolated haematuria
Among all cases of isolated hematuria from our study,
IgAN was the most frequent pathohistologic diagnosis
which is in accordance with results of Coppo et al. and

Yin XL et al. [2, 22]. Some authors had IgAN in third
place [36], but it is not clear whether they used IM in all
analysed samples or not.
In half of the patients, TIN was usual PHD finding in
acute renal failure. Crescentic GN was found only in
one patient as well as EDGN. In contrast, a Spanish
study by Lopez-Gomez et al. listed thrombotic microan￾giopathy as the main reason for renal biopsy, while in
South Asian children HUS and TIN were also an im￾portant cause for AKI [15, 37]. A report from the Italian
National Registry of Renal Biopsies in Children indicated
that crescentic GN was the most common disease in the
group of acute renal failure, followed by TIN [2].
Among our three patients with chronic renal failure,
one had IgAN, one patient had FSGS as well as TIN, and
one patient had FSGS, Mohapatra et al. also showed IgAN
as a predominant diagnosis, followed by endoproliferative
glomerulonephritis (EPGN) and FSGS [15]. The lack of
data in the chronic renal failure group could be the reason
for a small incidence in children. Additionally, kidney bi￾opsy is not necessary to start appropriate treatment in ad￾vanced stage of certain chronic kidney disease.

Trends of PHD results along the time
Our comparative study of PHD-s of all biopsies showed
significant increase of IgAN from 13.8% in our previous
study to 24.7% in this study [2]. Similar results were no￾ticed in some other comparative studies as well [3, 12].
Those findings might be the result of higher numbers of
biopsied patients with isolated hematuria and changes in
classification of IgAN. With the use of Oxford classifica￾tion of IgAN, many samples with previous PHD of
MesPGN changed into IgAN, because mesangial prolifera￾tion is now a part of Oxford classification [23, 39, 40].
Czech Registries of Renal Biopsies from the period be￾tween 1994 and 2011, showed that MCD and minimal
glomerular abnormalities were the most frequent PHD,
and they have increasing pathways [4, 6]. In our two
comparative studies, the frequency of MCD increased sig￾nificantly from 4.6 to 16.7% [9]. Although these numbers
show a significantly increasing trend, they are still rela￾tively smaller than in Czech studies. We believe that this
can be explained due to the fact that we had stricter indi￾cations for NS kidney biopsy in our hospital. The classifi￾cation of proliferation of mesangial cells has also changed
(previous study was done from 1995 to 2005) at which
point MCD was named MesPGN. In our present study,
the number of MesPGN dramatically dropped compared
to our previous study [9]. High variability of MesPGN was
also reported in other countries, such as in Pakistan [28],
India [13], and Jordan [41]. The decreasing pathway of
MesPGN in our research may be explained by some of the
cases of IgAN that were unrecognized previously, due to
incomplete sample analyses with immunohistochemistry
and electron microscopy, or due to the introduction of up￾dated Oxford classification of IgAN [4, 6, 23, 25, 31, 39,
40]. In that circumstance many IgAN diagnoses, as well as

glomerulonephritis (MesPGN), IgA nephropathy (IgAN), Henoch-Schӧnlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), Focal

Arapović et al. BMC Nephrology (2020) 21:65 Page 9 of 12

MCD and TBMN had a higher possibility to be missed or
mixed up [6].
In our study the frequency of Alport’s syndrome sig￾nificantly rose compared to our previous study [9]. The
reason for that could be that we paid more attention to
patients with isolated hematuria than earlier, due to
growing knowledge on inherited glomerulopathies. Gen￾erally, we have to add that PHD of AS and TBMN can
be confirmed by genetical analysis. Therefore, we ex￾pected that renal biopsy will not be necessary in many
cases of hereditary glomerulopathies in the future. Bi￾opsy will probably be done only in selected cases [42].
FSGS from our study shares the fourth and fifth place
with AS, showing an increasing but not significant trend
over time, when compared to our results from the previ￾ous 10-year period [9]. Similar results were reported in
the study from China [22].
During the study period, we also noticed an insignifi￾cant increase of HSPN frequency, which was recorded in
one Turkish and Chinese study, as well [3, 12]. Those
findings are probably due to increased awareness of pos￾sible renal affection in Hennoch Schonlain vasculitis [31,
43]. Our investigation also showed a permanently low
number of LN cases, as also shown in the research by
Fidan et al. while LN is more common in Hispanics,
Blacks and Asians than Caucasians [15, 20].
The prevalence of C1q nephropathy in renal biopsy
worldwide has been shown to vary between 0.2 to 16%
[44–47]. The reasons for this discrepancy could be attrib￾uted to inconsistent use of C1q immunofluorescence stain￾ing, and different criteria for the renal biopsies. In our
study C1q was found in about 2% of all biopsied patients,
which had not been noted in our previous study at al [9].
The drawback of our study is small numbers of renal
biopsies to conclude a significant trend. Therefore, more
cases should be observed in future studies to draw ap￾propriate conclusions.
Complications of renal biopsy
Regarding biopsy complications, their numbers vary sig￾nificantly in literature from 3.0–30%, but very few publi￾cations reported serious complications like heavy
bleeding or gross hematuria [7, 17]. Therefore, our study
is in accordance with the other studies that had low fre￾quency of severe complications [4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 17, 18].
Comparation of biopsy results between two 10-years
periods in our hospital
The significant rise in frequencies of IgAN, AS and MCD
and insignificant rise of HSPN, FSGS in the recent 10-year
period should be noticed, as well as significant decrease of
MesPGN, compared to our previous study [9].
The reason for this difference might be the different PHD
classification. Namely, for the classification of MesPGN we
previously used the Churg criteria [48], which was common
in the past, while new criteria is being used since 2006 [49].
Additionally, mesangial proliferation was associated with a
loss of podocytes on EM, and was classified as MCDs with
minimal proliferation of mesangial cells, or as IgM ne￾phropathy in case of abundant IgM.
In our study, IgAN demonstrated a trend of increased
frequency in comparison to the period of 1995–2005
primarily due to implementation of Oxford classification
[23, 39, 40]. The reason for this might also be our ten￾dency to select more patients with persistent micro￾scopic hematuria, with or without associated proteinuria
for renal biopsies. When clinical findings point to HSPN,
biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis and to predict
the disease prognosis, which is important for therapy.
Therefore, it was more often performed than previously.
Conclusions
We found that the frequencies of MesPGN, IgAN, AS,
MCD nephropathies in children in Croatia’s Dalmatia
region has changed from the period 1995–2005 to
2008–2017. IgAN, AS, MCD nephropathies are more
common and MesPGN nephropathy is diagnosed less
frequently based on a kidney biopsy. Changes in the
relative frequency of GN type might be partly due to the
use of new classifications of certain glomerulonephritis
(HSPN, IgAN) and the appearance of new entities (C3
nephropathy, C1q nephropathy). An additional reason
for these changes may be due to policy changes and
practices, changes in performing renal biopsies [9] as
well as availability of technical possibilities for patohisto￾logical analysis of biopsied material, especially electron
microscopy. All these factors can influence different
prevalence of pathological findings. Therefore, it is ne￾cessary to continue monitoring renal biopsies in order to
gain clinical knowledge important for establishing new
guidelines that would help clinicians in everyday
practice.
