Abstract
Background Renal vasculature is known for having a broad
spectrum of variants, which have been classically reported
by anatomists.
Methods The distribution and morphology of these varia￾tions can be explained by considering the embryology of the
renal vessels. With the recent outburst of imaging techni￾ques, it has been the radiologist’s turn to take the baton,
recognising and describing unconventional renal vascular
patterns.
Results Knowledge of these patterns has gained signifi￾cance since the advent of the era of transplantation. For
almost 60 years cadaveric donation has been the main
source of kidneys suitable for transplantation. Living
kidney donation demonstrates many advantages and
stands out as the best alternative for organ procurement
to meet the increasing demand. Since the dawn of
laparoscopic nephrectomy as the technique of choice
for organ procurement in living kidney donors, MDCT
plays a key role as a noninvasive preoperative planning
method for anatomic evaluation. As the field of view at
laparoscopic surgery is limited, it is essential to metic￾ulously assess the origin, number, division and course
of arteries and veins.
Conclusion Awareness of the different anatomical variants
allows the radiologist to enlighten the surgeon in order to
avoid compromising the safety of the surgical procedure that
could lead to significant complications.

Anatomy
Introduction
Renal vessels are acknowledged for presenting a wide range
of variations. The study of the renal pedicle and its pecu￾liarities has been of interest to anatomists since the end of
the nineteenth century. The distribution and morphology of
these anomalies can be explained by considering the embry￾ological development of the renal vasculature, but it was
after the outburst of imaging techniques that radiologists
started recognising and describing unconventional renal
vascular patterns, which led to a systematic clinical ap￾proach to this topic. Knowledge of these patterns has gained
significance with the advent of the era of transplantation.
Thanks to its success, this now everyday practice has enor￾mously increased the need for organs. Given this growing
demand, kidneys from living donors have been considered
as an alternative to cadaveric donation to expand the pool of
organs. Living kidney donation demonstrates many advan￾tages and stands out as the best alternative for organ pro￾curement. There has been a significant reduction of waiting

time for transplantation since it can be done on a scheduled
basis, even before entry into dialysis programmes [1].
When performed in this manner, an optimisation of con￾ditions of donor and recipient, such as minimum ischaemia
time, can be achieved. There is a lower incidence of
delayed graft function, which is a negative prognostic
factor for graft survival [1]. This fact allows not only for
better graft endurance but also superior recipient survival
compared to transplantation with a cadaveric donor. There
is a reduced incidence of rejection and therefore less need
for immunosuppressive drugs. As a consequence, not only
more organs are available, but also there is less need for re￾transplantation. Furthermore, live donor transplantation is
more cost effective than cadaveric transplantation [1].
It was due to a great disproportion between organ supply
and demand that laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy was
conceived as an effort to meet the ever-growing demand and
thus reduce the shortage for organs [1, 2].
Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy has become the
technique of choice over laparotomy to increase organ avail￾ability. It has demonstrated a significant reduction of pain
and morbidity, resulting in less use of analgesics and less
frequent and generally milder postoperative complications,
the most common being acute urinary retention and pares￾thesias. Both hospital stay and recovery time are reduced
compared to laparotomised donors, permitting the patient to
resume the activities of daily living and return to work
sooner. Thanks to the better cosmetic results and a reduction
of pain, it has been hypothesised that more people would be
interested in donation. However, the involvement of an
invasive intervention in a previously healthy candidate
demands unique management and care. It is here where
radiologists play an essential role in the anatomical evalua￾tion of kidneys, placing special emphasis on the importance
of certain relevant findings prior to nephrectomy [1, 2].
Angio-CT
Technique
Traditionally, living renal donors underwent radiographic
evaluation with intravenous urography (IVU) and renal
and aortic angiography. Depiction of renal size, calculi,
calcifications and anatomy of the collecting system and
arteries was fulfilled with these two techniques; however,
renal masses, small lithiasis and venous anomalies were not
properly assessed. For these and other reasons, the proce￾dure has been replaced with CT evaluation since it offers
unquestionable advantages [3]. CT angiography is less in￾vasive, better tolerated by donors, and provides significantly
more information than intravenous urography and angiog￾raphy together, especially regarding abdominal anatomy and
vascular pathways [4–6]. Previous works have shown that
CT angiography has 100 % sensitivity identifying accessory
arteries and 93 % sensitivity identifying prehiliar arterial
branches [7]. The study consists of only one technique and
can be done in just 1 day, as opposed to IVU and angiogra￾phy, which needed a minimum of 2 days because of contrast
restriction. This fact also implies an overall cost reduction of
the procedure that has been reported to be of 35–50 % [8].
The most essential step in a CT angiography is un￾doubtedly the acquisition of raw data. The value and
accuracy of the volumetric study will depend on this first
stage [9–12]. Optimal timing of image acquisition and
meticulous management of the patient, including prepara￾tion, positioning and contrast injection technique, is cru￾cial. The technical parameters for the MDCT protocol
depend on the speed of the scanner, the section thickness
and the number of phases—in the majority of institutions
the study comprises a multiple phase procedure including
at least two of the following phases: unenhanced, arterial,
nephrographic and delayed.
The main aim of the unenhanced phase is to locate the
kidneys, rule out calculi and provide a baseline study to
compare the enhancement of eventual lesions. The optimal
timing for the contrast-enhanced phases depends on the
volume of contrast material, the administration rate and the
individual’s cardiac output—these factors mandate a delay
time between the start of the contrast introduction and the
beginning of the scan [3]. An arterial phase can be
programmed empirically 15–20 s after the injection of con￾trast material. However, using a bolus tracking detection
system with the ROI placed in the abdominal aorta guaran￾tees the success of the arterial phase acquisition. The scan
covers from the top of the kidneys to the sciatic notch, and it
allows the depiction of not only the renal arteries but also
the renal veins. A nephrographic phase 65–90 s after the
injection provides a proper enhancement of both renal and
small tributary veins. For arterial and nephrographic phases,
a minimum of 1-mm sections should be used for a better
visualisation of the lumbar veins and accessory renal arteries
because they can be small and easily missed when thicker
sections are used [3]. Finally, a delayed phase 7–10 min
after contrast injection is used to assess the renal collecting
system and ureters.
Despite the benefits of using all four phases, there are
consistent reasons to restrict this number: to limit the radi￾ation dose to healthy subjects and to prevent from certain
technical limitations like image noise and anode heating. To
cope with these inconveniences, the authors propose differ￾ent procedures: Kawamoto et al. dispense of the precontrast
phase since, according to their experience, nephro and uro￾lithiasis can be detected on arterial phase images with care￾ful scrolling through continuous images or using maximum
intensity projection (MIP). In addition, they also replaced
200 Insights Imaging (2013) 4:199–211

the nephrographic phase with a venous phase with a 55-s
delay, which is not optimal for depiction of renal neoplasms,
a criterion for exclusion as a donor [14]. Reducing the
kilovolt peak (<100 kV) in the precontrast phase results in
more image noise, yet the images are still diagnostically
satisfactory and the radiation dose is significantly reduced
[13]. The delayed phase can be replaced by either a delayed
topogram or conventional radiography to evaluate the ex￾cretory system, thus limiting the radiation dose (Table 1). A
single topogram is not always sufficient to assess the col￾lecting system, but in most cases it is. In fact, most pub￾lished authors agree with the use of a delayed topogram with
the goal of reducing radiation or even conventional radiog￾raphy [3, 6–8]. Although it is assumed that taking the patient
to the x-ray facility would be more complicated and time
consuming, a topogram in the modern CT scanners has a
high-quality image. However, in case of doubt, an extra
phase can be acquired to resolve uncertainties, always with
a low-dose acquisition.
Volumetric reconstruction techniques
Once raw data are acquired, the next step is to generate axial
images through a process called data or image reconstruc￾tion. Axial data can be directly analysed or used to produce
multiplanar images. Multiplanar reformation (MPR) is a
technique that processes information from axial CT images
to create non-axial two-dimensional coronal, sagittal,
oblique or curved plane images. MPR images can, in turn,
be thickened into slabs by means of projectional techniques
[19], thus displaying images that can emulate angiograms.
There are two main techniques used to perform CT
angiography.
MIP (maximum intensity projection) is a reconstruc￾tion algorithm that selects and displays only the voxels
with highest attenuation value of a selected slab in the
visualisation plane [19]. It is best used to evaluate the
brightest objects in the image, such as contrast material￾filled structures [19, 21]. This is why MIP has been
proven to be precise for the evaluation of the vascula￾ture and thus is widely employed in CT angiography.
Nevertheless, for a correct interpretation of MIP images,
it is necessary to be familiar with the limitations of this
algorithm: When evaluating atherosclerotic vessels, the
presence of high attenuation voxels, such as calcifica￾tions, limits the assessment of the vascular lumen by
overestimating stenosis [20, 22–24]. Since it is a two￾dimensional representation and it does not provide a
good sense of depth, MIP is not able to demonstrate
the 3D relationships of the vessels [19, 20, 23, 25]. To
include long segments of vessels in CT angiography,
thick-slab MIP images can be helpful, but small arteries
should be evaluated with thin sections viewed in se￾quence because usually they are not visible because of
their low attenuation [19]. Evaluation of vessels can be
improved by eliminating high-density structures such as
bone through slab editing [19, 26, 27].
Volume rendering is an effective modality for the 3D
display of imaging data. It assigns opacity values on a full
spectrum from 0 % (transparency) to 100 % (opacity) along
an artificial line of sight projection [19, 28, 29]. By com￾bining opacity values and lighting effects, volume rendering
allows for an appreciation of spatial relationships. It also
provides a good differentiation of two structures of little
difference in HU that are close in space to each other,
permitting a better visualisation of vessels compared to
MIP, and since bones do not obscure the visualisation of
vessels, therefore there is no need to perform slab editing
[20]. Also, volume rendering permits a better visualisation
of soft tissue and 3D relationships.
Radiologists should be aware of advantages and disad￾vantages of these techniques and how they complement
each other: MIP excels at displaying vascular maps and
small intraparenchymal vessels in enhancing organs
(Fig. 1), whereas volume rendering is better at depicting
small extraparenchymal vasculature, grading intraluminal
stenosis with calcium and demonstrating 3D relationships
between structures [20, 30, 31] (Fig. 2).
MRA vs. CTA
Some authors have proposed that MRA could replace
MDCT as a preoperative assessment method on renal
donors, avoiding exposure to radiation and nephropathy

due to contrast agents [15]. While the reduced radiation
exposure is a benefit, most donors are healthy individuals
with a normal renal function that rarely develop contrast￾induced nephropathy. Moreover, there are some limita￾tions regarding MR angiography: Motion artefacts are
more frequent in MRA studies since patients have to
hold their breath longer, and the study also requires more
time to complete. Angio CT permits higher resolution,
given that MRA pulse sequences do not allow scanning
with a thickness of 1 mm or less. There are some
artefacts that are more likely to occur in MRA and can
compromise image quality, such as phase encoding arte￾facts, vascular pulsation and chemical shift artefacts at
fat-soft tissue interfaces, especially in the retroperito￾neum. All these artefacts can cause misdiagnosis of small
vessels. In addition, the cost of MRA makes it a less
accessible technique in most centres [16–18].
Renal arteries
Embryology
The variations in the distribution and morphology of renal
artery supply can be explained by considering the embryology
of the renal vasculature. The most widely accepted and fre￾quently quoted theory was proposed by W. Felix and provides
a convenient embryological explanation of the diversity of
renal, adrenal and gonadal arteries. The mesonephros, in a 5th
week human embryo, is irrigated by a group or arteries arising
from the lateral surface of the abdominal aorta (Fig. 3a).
Initially they are distributed within the mesonephric area, but
later they also supply the reproductive glands, suprarenal
bodies, metanephros and diaphragm. The number of meso￾nephric arteries is not constant, and it follows the degeneration
of the mesonephros with the progressive craniocaudal devel￾opment of the embryo. As growth progresses, arteries recede
into the lumbar segments where mesonephric tubules are more
abundant, thus disappearing from the thoracic segments. From
the 10th thoracic to the 3rd lumbar segment, all the meso￾nephric arteries may persist. Considering these persisting ar￾teries in detail, they can be divided into three groups in the
region between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries: a
cranial, middle and caudal group. The latter originates a
network, the rete arteriosum urogenitale, which consists of
approximately 20 segmental branches that supply the meso￾nephros, reproductive gland and metanephros. Should some
of these arteries degenerate, adjacent vessels take their place.
The metanephros or ‘future kidney’ climbs upwards from the
pelvic to the lumbar region during the earlier morphogenetic
period. After achieving enough cranial blood supply, caudal
arteries regress. By the time it reaches its final position in the
lumbar region, it is supplied by various arteries. One of these
becomes the main renal artery while the rest either disappear
or persist as accessory renal arteries (Fig. 3b). The definitive
renal artery develops either from the last branch of the middle
group or the first of the caudal group. The relations between
the rete urogenitale and the metanephros illustrate the devel￾opment of accessory arteries and their relation to the kidney.
The suprarenal arteries mostly arise from the middle group,
but can also form from the cranial group just like the inferior
phrenic. Mesonephric arteries supplying the reproductive
gland form the gonad arteries, hence the varied number and
origin of these arteries. The irregular development of this
model explains why persisting vessels form the definite seg￾mental arteries of the adult kidney, having variations at their
point of origin [32].
Arterial anatomy
In most individuals, the kidneys are supplied by only a pair
of arteries arising from the abdominal aorta below the

origin of the mesenteric artery at the level of the L1 to L2
vertebral bodies. Each renal artery is divided into anterior
and posterior branches (presegmental arteries) at the hilium
of the kidney. It further divides into segmental arteries to
supply the respective segments of the kidney (apical, upper,
middle, inferior and posterior). It has been demonstrated
that there is a segmental arrangement of these vessels that
is stable, and there is no collateral arterial circulation
between the segments, establishing that each of the seg￾ments is supplied by their own segmental artery [33]. But
this segmental model is not constant, and variations in
renal arteries, including the number, source and course,
are very common. They are often related to malpositioned
or malrotated kidneys, but have also been described in up
to a 30 % of cases in dissection series in orthotopic kidneys
[7, 8, 34–36] (Figs. 4 and 5). These variations are probably
the result of an uneven degeneration of the rete arteriosum
urogenitale and the rest of the mesonephric arteries. This
may explain why there is some variation in the point of
origin of those arteries that persist to form the final seg￾mental arteries of the adult kidney.
Arterial variants
The diversity in renal arterial anatomy can be classified
according to the number, division pattern as well as distri￾bution/origin of the arteries. Accessory renal arteries can
arise from the abdominal aorta above the main branch or
as low (inferiorly) as the internal iliac artery. Varied origins
such as the iliac, superior and inferior mesenteric, celiac,
middle colic, lumbar, middle sacral and contralateral renal
arteries have been reported [35, 37] (Fig. 6).
Considering the division pattern, a common variant is
when the main renal artery divides before it reaches the
renal hilum. This condition is named the extrahiliar branch￾ing [7, 8, 35] (Fig. 7). Should it take place within 1.5 cm of
the renal ostium in the abdominal aorta, it is called early
branching [7] (Fig. 8). It is essential to identify any prehilar

relationship to eventual metanephros in a 4–6-week embryo and 8–10-
week embryo. SMA: Superior mesenteric artery, IMA: inferior mesen￾teric artery, 1: cranial group mesonephric arteries, 2: middle group

mesenteric artery, IMA: inferior mesenteric artery, GA: gonadal artery,
AG: adrenal gland, AA: adrenal artery, MTN: metanephros, RA: renal
artery, PAA: polar accessory artery. The adrenal artery usually devel￾ops from the cranial group of mesonephric arteries whereas the gonadal
artery forms from arteries of the caudal group (RAU). The definite
renal artery comes either from the last branch of the middle group or
the first of the caudal group. Persisting mesonephric arteries form
accessory vessels (PAA) as shown in the example

triple arterial system: a right renal artery (thin white arrow), a central

branching that occurs within 2 cm of the origin of the renal
artery from the abdominal aorta, since most surgeons require
at least a 2-cm length of renal artery before hilar branching
to guarantee satisfactory control and anastomosis [14].
According to Raman et al., early branching of the left renal
arteries (<2 cm from the aorta) is present in 21 % of cases
whereas early branching of the right renal arteries is present
in 15 % of individuals [38].
When there are two or more arteries with a separate
origin, the vessel with the greatest diameter is considered
as the main renal artery, and the rest are branded as acces￾sory or supernumerary. Additional arteries can, in turn, be
divided into two categories according to how they attain the
kidney: hiliar, entering at the hilium, and polar, reaching at
the pole [39]. Multiple renal arteries can be seen in one-third
of patients. In a study with 800 kidneys from cadaver
donors, Pollak et al. demonstrated 23 % double arteries,
4 % triple arteries and 1 % quadruple arteries [40]. This
multiplicity is more frequently unilateral than bilateral [23].
The most frequent accessory artery is a polar artery arising
from the aorta, close to the origin of the main renal branch,
and supplies the inferior renal pole (Fig. 9). The second
most frequent supplementary artery irrigates the upper pole,
which is normally a small segment [40]. Some authors call
polar arteries those that attain any of the kidney poles with
independence of its origin. It may be helpful, strictly from a
labelling point of view, to distinguish between these polar
arteries, tagging them as polar branches when they arise
from the main renal artery and polar accessory arteries when
they have a separate origin. The importance of polar arteries
is shown in the fact that they supply renal parenchyma, and
when damaged during nephrectomy it can cause arterial
bleeding or renal infarction. A case particularly worth men￾tioning is inferior polar arteries that provide vessels for the
upper excretory system. A section of an inferior polar artery
can cause pyeloureteral necrosis of the graft leading to
stenosis or urinary tract leakage. If it is not possible to

preserve the artery, a pyeloureteral anastomosis between the
graft and the recipient can be considered [41] (Figs. 10a, b,
11, and 12).
Renal veins
Embryology
The embryo’s venous system is composed of a very
irregular network of capillaries from which individual
ones transform definitively into veins while others
disappear. As a result the venous system is not very
uniform, and in the adult we can find far more var￾iants of veins than on the arterial side. We will focus
on the development of the renal veins and their prim￾itive origin, the subcardinal veins and their anastomo￾ses that explain the multiplicity of variants that we
can find.
Throughout the 4th week the posterior or inferior cardinal
veins, which drain the inferior part of the embryo, are
formed. The mesonephros drains in the subcardinal veins
that develop during the 5th week. They are located ventro￾medially to the mesonephros and run parallel to the posterior
cardinal veins. Subcardinal veins connect with the posterior
cardinal veins through multiple anastomoses (intersubcardi￾nal anastomoses). Persistence of some of these anastomoses
explains many of the variants we can find. During the 6th
week, the supracardinal veins develop lying medially to the
posterior cardinal veins, assuming the drainage of the body
wall after the obliteration of the major portion of the poste￾rior cardinal veins (Fig. 13a). As the mesonephros regresses,
the metanephros and adrenal gland expand and ascend,
while the gonads descend [32]. This circumstance forces

drastic changes not only in their respective arterial systems,
but also in their venous drainage organisation, which adopts
more medial drainage routes to the anastomotic channels
between the supracardinal and subcardinal veins. These
anastomotic channels between the supracardinal and sub￾cardinal veins transform into the renal segment of the infe￾rior vena cava (IVC) [42]. After this communication has
been established, the left subcardinal vein disappears,
remaining only its distal portion as the left gonadal
vein. Hence, the right subcardinal vein is transformed
into the main drainage route, forming the suprarenal
segment of the IVC, whereas the supracardinal veins
contribute to the development of the infrarenal part of
the IVC and to the azygos and hemiazygos vein sys￾tems (Fig. 13b) [42].
Venous anatomy
Following the venous flow, the renal cortex is drained
consecutively by the stellate veins, the arcuate and interlo￾bar veins [23, 43–46]. It has been demonstrated that, as
opposed to the intrarenal arteries, the intrarenal veins show
no segmental arrangement at all, there being a free anasto￾mosis of the venous system throughout the kidney. These
anastomoses occur at different levels between the stellate
veins (cortex), between the arquate veins (base of the pyr￾amids) and between the interlobar veins (close to the renal
sinus). There are also anastomoses around the calyceal
necks that join a longitudinal system that ends up forming
big trunks that finally form the main renal vein [47]. Thanks
to this network, ligation of the venous branches can be
performed if one vessel is cut or damaged during surgery,
permitting an alternate flow and avoiding the risk of paren￾chymal loss. The renal vein is usually located anterior to the

The right subcardinal vein constitutes the suprarenal segment while the
I-SA derives into the left renal vein. The hepatic segment forms from
the vitelline vein. The azygos and hemiazygos systems are formed
from the cranial part of the SPV. The caudal part of the right SPV
persists as the infrarenal segment of the IVC. The left subcardinal vein
regresses partially, remaining its distal portion as the left gonadal vein.
Finally, the persisting segment of the inferior/posterior cardinal veins
forms the iliac veins

renal artery at the renal hilum [23]. Around 85 % of the
population have just one right renal vein. It is about 2–
2.5 cm in length and follows an anterosuperior trajectory,
reaching the IVC at the level of the inferior margin of L1
[7]. Normally no other extrarrenal veins attain the right renal
vein. The left renal vein is on average 8.5 cm in length. It
normally takes a transverse and ventral course between
the superior mesenteric artery and the abdominal aorta
before reaching the inferior vena cava at the level of
L2-L3. As opposed to the right renal vein, the left renal
vein receives several tributaries before joining the infe￾rior vena cava [7, 37]. It receives the left adrenal vein
superiorly and that in turn receives the inferior phrenic
and capsural veins. The left gonadal vein joins the left
renal vein inferiorly. The posterior aspect is attained in
75 % of cases by retroperitoneal veins (lumbar, ascend￾ing lumbar and hemiazygos) [7].
Venous variants
The venous anatomy is not without variations—in fact,
we can find far more variants of veins than on the
arterial side. The most common is the existence of mul￾tiple renal veins, which occurs in 15 %–30 % of patients
[23, 44]. There are multiple right renal veins in 30 % of
cases, which consist of between two and four vessels that
originate in the hilum [7, 48, 49] (Fig. 14a, b). A unique
right renal vein, in 4 % of individuals, may branch prior
to its union with the IVC to let the right gonadal artery
pass through. In 6 % of right gonadal veins and 3 % of
retroperitoneal veins, they directly join the right renal
vein instead rather than the IVC [7].
The most characteristic variant of the left renal vein is
the circumaortic renal vein (17 % of patients), so named
because it embraces the ventral and dorsal aorta [23]
(Fig. 15). The circumaortic renal vein has two varieties.
The most common is a single vein that originates in the
hilum and splits right before surrounding the aorta
(75 %), while in the less common variety the vein
duplicates from its origin in the hilum [50] (Figs. 16
and 17). Typically, in the circumaortic variety the gonad￾al vein joins the dorsal branch and the adrenal vein the
ventral branch [44]. In the embryo the left renal vein

develops from the intersubcardinal anastomoses, which
course anterior to the aorta. Persistence of both the
intersupracardinal and intersubcardinal veins forms the
circumaortic ring, with one vein coursing anterior and
the other posterior to the aorta [42].
The retroaortic renal vein is a less common entity. It
has been reported in 3 % of the population. It usually
joins the lower lumbar portion of the inferior vena cava,
though less frequently it can also drain into the iliac
vein [51] (Figs. 18 and 19).
The left renal vein develops from the intersubcardinal
anastomoses, which course anterior to the aorta. The
retroaortic left renal vein occurs when the vein derives
from the intersupracardinal veins, which are located
posterior to the aorta [42, 52].
Other vessels
Lumbar veins
Retroperitoneal veins (lumbar, ascending lumbar and
hemiazigos) join the left renal vein in up to 75 % of
individuals, whereas in only a 3 % they empty into the
right renal vein [49] (Fig. 20). Normally left lumbar
veins course ventrally and reach the posterior aspect of
the left renal vein. Retroperitoneal veins draining into
the left renal vein are of great importance, since they
are variably sized and are often hidden during laparos￾copy surgery. Clinically significant lumbar veins thicker

than 3 mm can be identified using MDCT with high
sensitivity and specificity.
MDCT does not consistently demonstrate veins smaller
than 3 mm, but these vessels are irrelevant from a clinical
point of view as they could be cut and sealed during dissec￾tion without substantial bleeding [18]. With the goal of
decreasing radiation, some authors have replaced multi￾phase scans by a single late arterial phase where renal veins
can be identified. However, since retroperitoneal veins en￾hance more slowly, they should be properly evaluated in the
venous phase, avoiding the risk of misdiagnosis that could
compromise surgery. Leventhal et al. reviewed the result
after 500 donor laparoscopic nephrectomies and reported 6
open conversions due to bleeding. Two out of the six (33 %)
were due to lumbar vein injuries. They acknowledged that
venous dissection represented the “most challenging aspect
of the laparoscopic donor procedure”, especially if lumbar
branches were present [18, 53]. Given the limitations in the
field of view during laparoscopy, an accurate preoperative
assesment of renal vessels, including the retroperitoneal
veins, is crucial to prevent complications such as haemor￾rhage and gas embolism [18].
Adrenal vessels
Adrenal glands are irrigated by three different sources: the
inferior phrenic arteries, renal arteries and aorta. They are
supplied by all three in 34 % of cases, by two in 61 % and
by a single vessel in 5 %. The main vascular contribution
comes from the renal artery in 71 % of cases.
A single right adrenal vein joins the IVC in most
cases (69 %) while in 31 % of individuals an accesory
adrenal vein drains in the right renal vein. On the left
side, almost constantly, the left adrenal vein joins both
the left inferior phrenic and capsular veins to drain in
the superior aspect of the left renal vein [7, 54].
Gonadal vessels
Gonadal arteries are paired vessels arising from the
abdominal aorta at the level of L2, passing obliquely
in a downward trajectory on the psoas muscle, and
reaching the inguinal canal or the round ligament. In
most individuals (83 %) they arise adjacent to each
other from the anterior aspect of the aorta, below the
origin of the renal arteries [7]. Arched gonadal arteries,
arteries coursing anterior to both renal veins with an
aortic origin, have been described in 20 % of these
cases [55]. They can also originate from the middle
suprarenal artery and lumbar arteries. They may come
from a common trunk and head into two or three
branches. The most frequent variants are: a right gonad￾al artery arising from the right renal artery and a left
artery with an aortic origin (6 %); a left gonadal artery
starting at the level of the left renal artery with an
aortic origin of the right gonadal (4 %); and gonadal
arteries arising from the renal arteries (4 %) [7, 35].
In 93 % of individuals the right gonadal vein reaches
the IVC below the level of the renal veins, while in
7 % of cases it joins the right renal vein. The left
gonadal vein attains the left renal vein in most cases.
Gonadal veins are 2–3 mm in diameter on average,
growing up to 10 mm (mostly in post partum women).
A gonadal vein with a significant diameter should be
reported because the surgeon may need to use a differ￾ent ligation procedure instead of cauterisation [39, 41].
Conclusion
ANGIO-CT plays a key role as a noninvasive preoperative
method for assessment of possible kidney donors. Since renal
vasculature presents a broad spectrum of variants, the goal of
this evaluation is to determine if a patient is a suitable candi￾date for donor nephrectomy on the basis of the renal vascular
anatomy. Awareness of the different variants together with a
detailed report of their distribution and morphology also
allows the radiologist to enlighten the surgeon in order to
avoid compromising the safety of the surgical procedure,
which could lead to significant complications.
