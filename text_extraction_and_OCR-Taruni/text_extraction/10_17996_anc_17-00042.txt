Abstract
In recent years, advancements in diagnostic imaging modalities, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), as well as the accumulation of cases,
have allowed a more accurate diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). In addition, emerging cases of “isolated CS”
in which no obvious lesions are present in organs other than the heart have been reported, and the clinical
importance of CS has become recognized. Many issues including etiology, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of
CS remain to be solved. Considering this situation, guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac
sarcoidosis were recently updated by the Japanese Circulation Society and were published in February 2017.

I
n the diagnosis and management of cardiac sarcoidosis
(CS), there are a number of critical issues. Because of a low
histological diagnostic rate of CS by endomyocardial biopsy
(EMB), a definitive diagnosis is not always easy. Also, CS is
difficult to distinguish from some other conditions such as
dilated cardiomyopathy. Corticosteroid therapy improves
cardiac function and prognosis, and, in particular, earlier
intervention is considered to provide better therapeutic results.
Treatment involving the insertion of implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy
(CRT) devices has markedly improved the prognosis for CS.
However, prognosis remains poor in patients with advanced
cardiac dysfunction or heart failure. Occasionally, cardiac
dysfunction may progress rapidly̶within a few months or
one year. All of these factors indicate that accurate early
diagnosis and timely treatment intervention are extremely
important for the management of CS. This being the case, the
Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiac Sarcoido￾sis (Chair: Fumio Terasaki) (1) were published in February
2017 by the Japanese Circulation Society (JCS) and its
collaborative organizations, including the Japanese Society of
Nuclear Cardiology (JSNC). Considering current circumst￾ances and trends, we feel it important for us to share our up-to￾date knowledge regarding the diagnostic criteria for CS.
Diagnostic guidelines for cardiac sarcoidosis
There have been only a few guidelines that address how to
diagnose and treat CS. Many healthcare professionals have
followed the “Diagnostic standard and guidelines for
sarcoidosis,” which were created in 1992 and revised in 2006
in Japan (2, 3), and “The WASOG Sarcoidosis Organ
Assessment Instrument,” which originated as A Case Control
Etiology of Sarcoidosis Study (ACCESS) sarcoidosis organ
assessment instrument in 1999 and was revised in 2014 by the
World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous
Disorders (WASOG) (4). In 2014, the Heart Rhythm Society
(HRS) proposed an expert consensus statement on the
diagnosis of CS (5). The revision of these guideline documents
was required to reflect the current situation and recent
developments in diagnostic approaches.
In the updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of
CS, the JCS has further revised criteria for cardiac

involvement of sarcoidosis (1) over those presented in the
2006 guideline (Table 1). New guidelines describing how to
diagnose CS for the histological diagnosis group (those with
positive myocardial biopsy findings) and for the clinical
diagnosis group (those with negative myocardial biopsy
findings or those not undergoing myocardial biopsy) have
been developed (Table 2). Guidelines on diagnosing isolated
CS were also created (6) (Table 3).
New feature of the updated CS guidelines
Criteria for cardiac involvement were revised from the 2006
version in the following ways: 1) Fatal ventricular arrhythmia
(e. g., sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular
fibrillation), which is considered important, was included in
the major criteria where high-grade atrioventricular block is
listed. 2) Abnormal ventricular wall anatomy (ventricular
aneurysm, thinning of the middle or upper ventricular septum,
regional ventricular wall thickening), which is considered
clinically significant in diagnosing cardiac involvement, was
moved from the minor criteria to the major criteria where basal
thinning of the ventricular septum is listed. 3) Abnormally
high tracer accumulation in the heart with 18F￾fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
(PET) is considered an important finding that reflects the
activity of inflammation in CS and was moved from the
remarks to the major criteria. 4) The late-gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) of the myocardium in gadolinium￾enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was moved
from the minor criteria to the major criteria as it is considered
an important index of tissue damage and fibrosis in CS.
Importance of imaging modalities
As epithelioid granulomas in CS develop sporadically in the
myocardium, it has been reported that only 20% of patients
with epithelioid granulomas can be correctly diagnosed with
an EMB because biopsy samples do not contain granuloma￾tous tissues. The low sensitivity of EMB in CS may be partly
due to preferential location of myocardial injury in the mid￾Terasaki et al. ― 43 ―

Table 1 Criteria for cardiac involvement of sarcoidosis
1. Major criteria
(a) High-grade atrioventricular block (including complete atrioventricular block) or fatal ventricular arrhythmia (e. g., sustained
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation)
(b) Basal thinning of the ventricular septum or abnormal ventricular wall anatomy (ventricular aneurysm, thinning of the middle or
upper ventricular septum, regional ventricular wall thickening)
(c) Left ventricular contractile dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%)
(d) 67Ga citrate scintigraphy or 18F-FDG PET reveals abnormally high tracer accumulation in the heart
(e) Gadolinium-enhanced MRI reveals delayed contrast enhancement of the myocardium
2. Minor criteria
(f) Abnormal ECG findings: Ventricular arrhythmias (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, multifocal or frequent premature
ventricular contractions), bundle branch block, axis deviation, or abnormal Q waves
(g) Perfusion defects on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (SPECT)
(h) Endomyocardial biopsy: Monocyte infiltration and moderate or severe myocardial interstitial fibrosis

Table 1 (cont.)
Clinical findings defining cardiac involvement
Cardiac findings should be assessed based on the major criteria and the minor criteria. Clinical findings that satisfy the following 1) or 2)
strongly suggest the presence of cardiac involvement.
1) Two or more of the five major criteria (a) to (e) are satisfied .
2) One of the five major criteria (a) to (e) and two or more of the three minor criteria (f) to (h) are satisfied.
（Note: English translation of tables has been provided by the authors.）
Table 2 Diagnostic guidelines for cardiac sarcoidosis
1) Histological diagnosis group (those with positive myocardial biopsy findings)
Cardiac sarcoidosis is diagnosed histologically when endomyocardial biopsy or surgical specimens demonstrate non-caseating
epithelioid granulomas.
2) Clinical diagnosis group (those with negative myocardial biopsy findings or those not undergoing myocardial biopsy)
The patient is clinically diagnosed as having sarcoidosis (1) when epithelioid granulomas are found in organs other than the heart, and
clinical findings strongly suggestive of the above-mentioned cardiac involvement (Table 1) are present; or (2) when the patient shows
clinical findings strongly suggestive of pulmonary or ophthalmic sarcoidosis; at least two of the five characteristic laboratory findings of
sarcoidosis (Table 4); and clinical findings strongly suggest the above-mentioned cardiac involvement (Table 1).

layer or epicardial layer rather than endocardial layer that is
suggested by LGE on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).
As the positive detection rate in EMB is much lower in
patients with normal heart function, a correct histological
diagnosis is difficult to make in patients at an early stage of
CS. However, it is critically important to diagnose the disease
at an early stage to ensure effective treatment and positive
outcomes.
In this regard, reliable, precise clinical diagnostic criteria
must be established without delay. As currently there are no
specific biomarkers available to diagnose CS, clinicians place
expectations on imaging modalities such as CMR and 18F￾FDG PET. CMR has good spatial resolution enough to discern
the location of LGE not only horizontal distribution but also
vertical involvement of myocardial layer. Although only LGE
is included in the criteria for cardiac involvement, the
usefulness of T2 weighted imaging and T1 mapping should be
investigated in the future. Significant positive tracer accu￾mulation with 18F-FDG PET is listed in the characteristic
laboratory findings associated with sarcoidosis (Table 4).
These findings reflect the active inflammation in sarcoidosis
and are useful in evaluating treatment efficacy. In the past few
years, many studies have shown the diagnostic utility of 18F￾FDG PET in patients with CS, and evaluation involving 18F￾FDG PET is therefore included as an important component in
the “Criteria for cardiac involvement of sarcoidosis” (Table 1)
and in the “Diagnostic guidelines for isolated cardiac
sarcoidosis” (Table 3). While 18F-FDG PET is considered
mandatory by the clinical diagnosis group, it has been pointed
out that physiological 18F-FDG uptake in the myocardium
should be prevented in order to make a correct diagnosis, and
specific points regarding its use have also been noted (3).
Further improvements to and advancements in imaging
modalities are being sought to ensure timely and accurate
diagnosis of CS.

Table 3 Diagnostic guidelines for isolated cardiac sarcoidosis
Prerequisite
1. No clinical findings characteristic of sarcoidosis are observed in any organs other than the heart. (The patient should be examined in
detail for respiratory, ophthalmic, and skin involvements of sarcoidosis. When the patient is symptomatic, other etiologies that can
affect the corresponding organs must be ruled out.)
2. 67Ga scintigraphy or 18F-FDG PET reveals no abnormal tracer accumulation in any organs other than the heart.
3. A chest CT scan reveals no shadow along the lymphatic tracts in the lungs or no hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (minor axis >
10 mm).
1) Histological diagnosis group
Isolated cardiac sarcoidosis is diagnosed histologically when endomyocardial biopsy or surgical specimens demonstrate non-caseating
epithelioid granulomas.
2) Clinical diagnosis group
Isolated cardiac sarcoidosis is diagnosed clinically when the criterion (d) and at least three other criteria of the major criteria (a)-(e) are
satisfied (Table 1).
（Note: English translation of tables has been provided by the authors.）
Table 4 Characteristic laboratory findings of sarcoidosis
1. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
2. High serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity or elevated serum lysozyme levels
3. High serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels
4. Significant tracer accumulation in 67Ga citrate scintigraphy or 18F-FDG PET
5. A high percentage of lymphocytes with a CD4/CD8 ratio of >3.5 in BAL fluid
Clinical diagnosis of sarcoidosis is supported when at least two of the above five characteristic findings are observed.
