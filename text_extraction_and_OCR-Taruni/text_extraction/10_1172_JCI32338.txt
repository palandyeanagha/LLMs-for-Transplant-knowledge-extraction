Mucormycosis causes mortality in at least 50% of cases despite current first-line therapies. Clinical and ani￾mal data indicate that the presence of elevated available serum iron predisposes the host to mucormycosis.
Here we demonstrate that deferasirox, an iron chelator recently approved for use in humans by the US FDA,
is a highly effective treatment for mucormycosis. Deferasirox effectively chelated iron from Rhizopus oryzae
and demonstrated cidal activity in vitro against 28 of 29 clinical isolates of Mucorales at concentrations well
below clinically achievable serum levels. When administered to diabetic ketoacidotic or neutropenic mice with
mucormycosis, deferasirox significantly improved survival and decreased tissue fungal burden, with an effi￾cacy similar to that ofliposomal amphotericin B. Deferasirox treatment also enhanced the hostinflammatory
response to mucormycosis.Mostimportantly, deferasirox synergistically improved survival and reduced tissue
fungal burden when combined with liposomal amphotericin B. These data support clinical investigation of
adjunctive deferasirox therapy to improve the poor outcomes of mucormycosis with current therapy. As iron
availability is integral to the pathogenesis of other infections (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria), broader investiga￾tion of deferasirox as an antiinfective treatment is warranted.
Introduction
Mucormycosis is a highly lethal infection caused by fungi belong￾ing to the order Mucorales of the class Zygomycetes (1, 2). Recent
data have demonstrated a striking increase in the frequency of
mucormycosis cases (3–5). Unfortunately, despite aggressive sur￾gical debridement and antifungal therapy, mortality from mucor￾mycosis remains at least 50% (2, 6). In patients with central ner￾voussystem involvement, prolonged neutropenia, or disseminated
disease, mortality is 80%–100% despite therapy (2, 4, 5, 7). Because
of its unacceptably high mortality rate, and the morbidity of dis￾figuring surgical therapy, it is desirable to develop new antifungal
therapies to treat invasive mucormycosis (8).
Iron isrequired by virtually all microbial pathogensfor growth and
virulence (9, 10). In mammalian hosts, sequestration of serum iron
by carrier proteinsis a major host defense mechanism against infec￾tion (8–11). Based on thisrole ofiron sequestration in innate immu￾nity, recent interest has been generated in the possibility of utilizing
iron chelation therapy as a treatmentforinfectious diseases. Mucor￾mycosisis a particularly promising target for iron chelation therapy
given the exceptional iron requirementfor growth and pathogenicity
of Mucorales (12–15). For example, it is likely that diabetic ketoaci￾dosis and other systemic acidoses predispose patientsto developing
mucormycosis by inducing dissociation of iron from sequestering
proteins,resulting in elevated available serum iron (2, 16, 17).
The potential therapeutic role of iron chelation therapy for
mucormycosiswasinitially obscured by the paradoxically increased
risk of developing mucormycosis during treatment with deferox￾amine (18). However, while deferoxamine is an iron chelator from
the perspective of the human host, it serves as a xenosiderophore
to Mucorales, which are able to specifically bind to deferoxamine￾iron complexes, strip the iron from the chelator through an ener￾gy-dependentreductive process, and facilitate iron uptake (12, 18).
Furthermore, administration of deferoxamine worsenssurvival of
animals with mucormycosis(12–15). In contrast, other iron chela￾tors do not act as iron siderophores for Mucorales. Specifically,
treatment of Rhizopus-infected mice (16) or guinea pigs (13) with
the iron chelator deferiprone markedly improved survival. Unfor￾tunately, while available in India and Europe, deferiprone is not
approved by the US FDA for use in humans.
In 2005, deferasirox became the first orally bioavailable iron
chelator approved for use by the FDA, with an indication for treat￾ment of iron overload in transfusion-dependent anemias. Given
the importantrole of iron in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis, as
well asthe current availability of deferasirox for use in humans, we
soughtto define the potential efficacy of deferasirox iron chelation
therapy against experimental mucormycosis in vitro and in vivo.
Results
Deferasirox kills Mucorales by iron starvation. We have previously found
thatiron starvation causesthe rapid expression ofthe high-affinity
iron permease gene (rFTR1) in Rhizopus oryzae (19), the most com￾mon cause of mucormycosis(2, 20). Therefore,to determinewheth￾er deferasirox effectively chelates iron from R. oryzae, we extracted
RNA and performed RT-PCR on R. oryzae 99-880 grown for 1 hour
at 37°Cin potato dextrose broth (PDB)supplementedwith 350 μM
ferric chloride (iron replete), 350 μM ferric chloride plus 2 mM

deferasirox (iron depleted), or 2 mM deferasirox plus supersatu￾rating 6 mM ferric chloride. The rFTR1 gene was expressed in the
presence of deferasirox, but not in media supplemented with ferric
chloride alone or in the presence of deferasirox plus supersaturat￾ing ferric chloride (Figure 1A). The possibility of contaminating
genomic DNA was excluded by lack of a detectable band when PCR
(rather than RT-PCR) was performed on RNA samples.
To confirm protein expression under chelating conditions,
the gene encoding GFP was cloned behind the rFTR1 promoter
(rFTR1p) (Figure 1B). R. oryzae M16 spores transformed with the
rFTR1p::GFP or actin promoter::GFP (ACT1p::GFP) (constitutive￾ly expressed positive control) constructs were incubated overnight
with deferasirox, deferasirox plus supersaturating ferric chloride,
or iron-replete media. M16 spores transformed with the constitu￾tive ACT1p::GFP construct were fluorescent regardless of growth
conditions (Figure 1C). In contrast, M16 spores transformed with
rFTR1p::GFP were only fluorescent in the presence of deferasirox
(Figure 1C). Similarly, by flow cytometry, less than 1% of untrans￾formed or rFTR1p::GFP-transformed spores grown in iron-replete
conditions were fluorescent (Figure 1C). In contrast, 43% ofspores
transformed with rFTR1p::GFP and grown in the presence defera￾sirox were fluorescent. Collectively, these data confirmed that
deferasirox induced an iron-starvation response in R. oryzae.
We next determined the deferasirox susceptibilities of mul￾tiple clinical isolates of Mucorales (Table 1). The MIC90s (mini￾mum concentrations at which 90% of isolates were inhibited)
of deferasirox against Mucor spp, non-oryzae Rhizopus spp, and
R. oryzae were 3.12–6.25 μg/ml. Minimum fungicidal concentra￾tions (MFCs) were similar to MICs, and deferasirox was cidal for
28 of 29 (97%) isolates. Of note, slight growth was seen within the
first 12 hours even at extremely high concentrations of deferasirox.
However, the fungi were dead by 24 hours even at low concentra￾tions of deferasirox, suggesting that deferasirox cidality was time
dependent rather than concentration dependent.
To determine if the cidal effect of deferasirox was related to
chelation of iron, we repeated susceptibility testing for 4 strains
of R. oryzae. Deferasirox was added at a concentration equivalent
to the previously established MFC. In half the wells, iron was
added at a molar ratio to saturate the deferasirox. For all 4 iso￾lates, addition of iron completely reversed the fungicidal effects
of the deferasirox, resulting in significant visible fungal growth
despite the presence of the drug.

In contrast to GFP under the control of the ACT1p, which was constitutively expressed regardless of growth conditions, GFP under the control 
of the rFTR1p was expressed only in the presence of iron chelation conditions (deferasirox [Def]).

Deferasirox is effective against R. oryzae in vivo in diabetic ketoacidotic mice. 
To determine deferasirox’s in vivo efficacy, diabetic ketoacidotic
mice were infected via the tail vein with 2.2 × 104 spores of R. oryzae
99-892. The mice were treated by oral gavage with 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg
deferasirox in 0.5% hydroxypropylcellulose (Klucel) twice daily for
7 days starting the day after infection. Control mice were treated
with hydroxypropylcellulose carrier (placebo) or deferasirox plus
saturating ferric chloride (administered subcutaneously). An addi￾tional negative control consisted of treatment of uninfected mice
with ferric chloride. Deferasirox at 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg twice daily
significantly improved survival compared with that of controls
(Figure 2A). While there was no statistical difference between the
time to death of mice treated with the different doses of defera￾sirox, a dose-response trend was observed, with more surviving
animals in higher-dose groups.
To determine the impact of deferasirox on tissue fungal bur￾den, diabetic ketoacidotic mice were infected via the tail vein with
4.2 × 104 spores of R. oryzae 99-892 as above. Mice were treated with
deferasirox (10 mg/kg twice daily), deferasirox plussaturating ferric
chloride, or placebo. Treatment was begun 16 hours afterinfection
and administered daily for 3 days. Deferasirox resulted in a greater
than 10-fold decrease in day 4 brain and kidney (primary target
organs) fungal burdens compared with placebo or deferasirox plus
saturating ferric chloride (Figure 2B). By histopathology, kidneys
of deferasirox-treated mice had no visible hyphae, whereas kidneys
of mice treated with placebo or deferasirox plus saturating ferric
chloride had extensively filamented fungi (Figure 2C). Further￾more, mice treated with saturating iron had a striking absence of
neutrophil influx to the sites of infection, while neutrophil influx
was prominent in the kidneys of mice treated with deferasirox.
To determine deferasirox’s activity against a second strain of
R. oryzae, we infected diabetic ketoacidotic mice via the tail vein
with the more virulent R. oryzae 99-880 isolate (inoculum, 1.3 × 103
spores, which is 10-fold lower than the inoculum with 99-892).
Infected mice were treated as above with deferasirox at 10 mg/kg
twice daily or placebo for 7 days. Deferasirox significantly improved
time to death compared with placebo (Figure 2D).
We also determined the efficacy of deferasirox in mice infected
intranasally as a model for pulmonary rather than disseminated
mucormycosis. For these studies, diabetic ketoacidotic mice were
infected with 107 spores of R. oryzae 99-880, which delivered a
reproducible number of spores to the lungs (median, 6.5 × 104

CFU/mouse; range, 3.8 × 104 to 9.7 × 104). Mice were treated for 7
days,starting 24 hours afterinfection, with deferasirox (10 mg/kg,
twice daily) or placebo. As controls, infected or uninfected mice
were treated with deferoxamine (50 mg/kg, i.p.), which is known
to supply iron to, rather than chelate iron from, R. oryzae. Defera￾sirox was protective compared with placebo or deferoxamine
(P = 0.009). As expected, deferoxamine worsened survival of infect￾ed mice compared with placebo (P = 0.047) and had no effect on
uninfected mice (Figure 3).
Effects of iron chelation versus excess iron on host immune response. The
diminished polymorphonuclear leukocyte influx seen in kidneys
of mice treated with saturating ferric chloride versusiron chelation
suggested that excess iron might directly suppress inflammation.
Therefore, we determined the impact of deferasirox iron chelation
therapy onTh1/Th2 and inflammatory cytokine
responses at sites of infection. Diabetic ketoaci￾dotic mice were infected with 3.1 × 104 spores
of R. oryzae 99-892 as above and treated with
deferasirox, deferasirox plus ferric chloride, or
placebo. On day 4 of infection, spleens and kid￾neys (which are heavily infected in the dissemi￾nated model; refs. 21, 22) were processed for
intracellular and whole-organ cytokine deter￾mination. Deferasirox resulted in a significant
increase in both Th1 and Th2 splenocyte fre￾quencies compared with saturating ferric chlo￾ride or placebo (Figure 4A). Deferasirox-treated
mice had significantly higher splenic levels of
the canonical proinflammatory cytokines TNF
and IFN-γ than mice treatedwith saturating iron
or placebo (Figure 4B). Mice treated with defera￾sirox also had significantly higher kidney levels
of IFN-γ (Figure 4B). In contrast, splenic and
renal concentrations of Th2 cytokines, includ￾ing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, did not significantly
differ between the groups (data not shown).
Because differences in Th2 cytokine levels
were not observed, and therefore lower Th2
cytokine levels could not explain increased Th1
cytokine levelsin mice treated with deferasirox,
we sought to determine whether deferasirox
treatment affected Treg or lymphocyte apopto￾sis frequencies. The frequencies of CD4+IL-10+
or CD4+CD25+foxp3+ lymphocytes were not
significantly different between the groups
(data notshown). There was also no significant
difference in splenocyte apoptosis between the
groups (data not shown).
Efficacy of deferasirox therapy in combination 
with liposomal amphotericin B. To determine
whether deferasirox was synergistic with
liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), diabetic
ketoacidotic mice were infected via the tail
vein with the more virulent R. oryzae 99-880
isolate and treated with placebo, LAmB alone
at 15 mg/kg/d i.v. for 4 days, deferasirox alone
at 10 mg/kg orally twice daily for 7 days, or a
combination of LAmB and deferasirox. Both
deferasirox and LAmB monotherapy signifi￾cantly improved survival compared with pla￾cebo (Figure 5A). However, the combination of deferasirox plus
LAmB significantly improved survival versus placebo and both
monotherapies (Figure 5A).
We also determined the impact of combination therapy on tis￾sue fungal burden. Treatment began 24 hours after infection and
was administered daily for 2 days because a substantial number of
deaths was anticipated in the placebo group by day 3 (Figure 2D
and Figure 5A). On day 3, kidneys and brains were removed,
homogenized, and quantitatively cultured. The kidney fungal
burden of mice treated with deferasirox alone was notsignificant￾ly different from that of mice treated with placebo (Figure 5B).
LAmB monotherapy and combination therapy decreased kid￾ney fungal burden versus placebo (Figure 5B). In contrast, in the
brain, only combination deferasirox plus LAmB significantly

reduced fungal burden versus placebo, and combination ther￾apy also significantly reduced brain fungal burden versus both
monotherapies (Figure 5B).
Efficacy of deferasirox in neutropenic, infected mice. To determine
whether deferasirox was also effective in the setting of neutropenia,
mice were myeloablated with cyclophosphamide. Two days later,
mice were infected via the tail vein with 2.7 × 103 spores of R. oryzae
99-892. Initial dose response studiessuggested that, in contrast to
the diabetic ketoacidotic model, optimal outcomes were achieved
with dosing of deferasirox every other day rather than every day
(data not shown), as we have previously described with the iron
chelator deferiprone (16). Treatment with deferasirox (10 mg/kg
twice every other day for 5 doses starting 24 hours after infection)
significantly improved time to death compared with placebo treat￾ment(Figure 6). In contrast, deferasirox administered daily did not
significantly improve time to death versus placebo.
No specific toxicity of deferasirox in neutropenic mice could be identi￾fied. Because deferasirox dosing every other day was optimal in the
neutropenic model, we sought to identify any potential toxicity
caused by daily dosing of deferasirox in neutropenic mice. Mice
were made neutropenic with cyclophosphamide as above but were
not infected. The mice were treated with deferasirox 10 mg/kg
twice daily for 7 days, 10 mg/kg twice every other day for 4 doses,
or placebo. Terminal bleeds were performed on day 3 or day 8 to
measure complete blood count,serum chemistries, and liver func￾tion tests. Histopathology was performed on a number of organs,
including brain, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys,
gastrointestinal tract (including stomach, small intestine, and
large intestine), and bone marrow (both smears and core). No dif￾ferences in white cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, platelet
counts, hemoglobin levels, serum chemistries (including creati￾nine, blood urea nitrogen, or electrolytes), or liver function tests
(including AST, ALT, or bilirubin) were identified between the 3
groups at either time point (data not shown). By histopathology,
no organ-specific toxicity attributable to deferasirox was identi￾fied, including no evidence of alterations in hematopoiesis.
Discussion
The role of iron sequestration in innate host defense against infec￾tion has gained increasing attention of late (8–11, 23, 24). Nev￾ertheless, iron chelation therapy has not been rigorously studied
against any type of infection, and regulatory agencies have not
approved iron chelators for the treatment of any infectious dis￾ease. Here we show that deferasirox induced an iron-starvation

response in R. oryzae and was cidal for multiple clinical isolates
from 2 different genera of the family Mucorales. The slight fun￾gal growth that occurred within 12 hours even at high concentra￾tions of deferasirox, and the cidality seen at 24 hours even at low
concentrations of deferasirox,suggested that deferasirox is a time￾dependent killer of Mucorales. Furthermore, the MICs and MFCs
of deferasirox against these isolates were well below clinically
achievable peak (~38 μg/ml) and trough serum levels (~17 μg/ml)
ofthe drug atsteady statewhen administered atthe FDA-approved
starting dose (20 mg/kg/d) (25). These in vitro susceptibility data
indicate that treatment of infected patients should be feasible
based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles.
The efficacy of deferasirox in treatment of mice with mucormyco￾siswas comparable to the efficacy of LAmB. Furthermore, deferasirox
was effective in both diabetic ketoacidotic and neutropenic murine
models.Importantly,the combination of deferasirox and LAmBwas
synergistic. In particular, combination deferasirox plus LAmB dra￾matically reduced brain fungal burden compared with either drug
alone. These data are concordant with our recent, successful treat￾ment of a patient with advanced, refractory cerebral mucormycosis
by adding salvage deferasirox therapy to LAmB (26).
Reversal ofthe protective effect of deferasirox by administration of
free iron indicatesthatthe drug’s mechanism of protectionwaslikely
iron chelation. Furthermore, itis known that deferasirox chelation is
specific forironand that othertrace metals and cations arenot affect￾ed by the drug (27, 28). However, deferasirox was associated with an
enhancement of the suppressed inflammatory response in diabetic
ketoacidotic mice. The mechanisms by which iron levels modulated
inflammation are not clear, aswe found no evidence of an impact on
Th2 cytokines, Tregs, orsplenocyte apoptosis. Ourfindings are con￾sistent with previous studies demonstrating that iron overload sup￾presses cell-mediated immune responses and inflammation, includ￾ing production of canonical Th1 cytokines such as IFN-γ or IL-12
(29–31). However, reduction of iron levels with chelators other than
deferasirox has also been shown to suppress Th1 polarization and
inflammatory responses and to favor Th2 responses (32, 33), so the
effects ofintracellulariron levels and iron chelation on hostimmune
responses appearto be protean.
Deferasirox appeared to be somewhat more effective in diabetic
ketoacidotic mice than in neutropenic mice. Although we hypoth￾esized that the diminished activity of daily dosing in neutrope￾nic mice might be due to a toxic effect of deferasirox, an extensive
evaluation failed to identify any toxicity. Specifically, there was no
evidence of exacerbation of or delayed recovery from bone marrow
ablation by chemotherapy. Nor was there any evidence of renal or
hepatic dysfunction by laboratory testing or any specific organ tox￾icity by histopathological evaluation. It is known that leukocytes
form an extensive storage pool foriron in mammals, and increased
erythropoiesis results in depletion of iron stores (8, 23, 34).
Furthermore, injury to rapidly dividing intestinal epithelial cells
by cyclophosphamide may inhibit uptake of iron from dietary
sources. Hence, the alteration in maximally effective deferasirox
dosing in neutropenic mice may relate to altered iron homeostasis
in hosts myeloablated with cyclophosphamide. Alternatively, the
enhanced efficacy of deferasirox in the diabetic ketoacidotic mouse
model might reflect the ability of this iron chelator to efficiently
chelate serum iron previously freed by proton-mediated dissocia￾tion from iron-sequestering proteins (2, 16, 17).
Little data has been published regarding the safety of deferasirox
in myeloablated hosts. In preclinical investigations of deferasirox,
no toxicities were seen in non–iron-overloaded marmosets after 39
weeks of treatment with up to 40 mg/kg/d, and during subacute
treatment (4 weeks), doses up to 65 mg/kg/d were well tolerated,
with no adverse effects (27). In clinical investigations (25, 28, 35),
deferasirox was very well tolerated at doses up to 40 mg/kg/d for
up to 12 days, and over months to years, at up to 30 mg/kg/d.
However, there have been rare postmarketing reports of cytopenias

in patients taking deferasirox, particularly in chronically trans￾fused patients with underlying marrow dyscrasias (i.e., myelodys￾plastic syndrome) (36). Similarly, cases of acute renal failure in
patients taking deferasirox have been reported (36). The relation￾ship between drug and toxicity in such cases remains unclear.
Given the demographics of aging in the US population, the inci￾dence of cancer and neutropenia will likely continue to rise in the
coming decade. Furthermore, an epidemic of obesity in the US
presages a worsening of the current epidemic of diabetes, and the
frequency of organ transplantation, with its associated immuno￾suppression, is on the rise (37). Because of the increasing frequency
of each of these major risk factors, it is likely that mucormycosis
will continue to increase in incidence. Given the poor outcomes
with maximal therapy, there is a critical need to develop novel
therapies for this highly lethal infection. We have found that the
FDA-approved iron chelator deferasirox has cidal activity against
multiple strains of Mucorales at clinically achievable concentra￾tions of the drug. Deferasirox was effective as monotherapy and
wassynergistic with LAmB, resulting in enhanced clearance of the
fungus from the brain and improved survival. These results sup￾port the need for a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of adjunc￾tive deferasirox in addition to polyene therapy in patients with
mucormycosis. These data also support the need for continued
investigation of deferasirox as an antiinfective therapy for other
diseases in which iron availability plays a crucial role in pathogen￾esis, including tuberculosis, malaria, and others.
Methods
R.oryzae and culture conditions. R. oryzae 99-880 is a clinical isolate from a
brain abscess of a diabetic patient. R. oryzae 99-892 is a clinical, pulmonary
isolate. R. oryzae 99-880 and 99-892 were provided by the Fungus Testing
Laboratory at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio,
Texas, USA. R. oryzae M16 is a pyrF-null mutant (pyrF encodes orotidine 5′-
phosphate decarboxylase, an enzyme required for uracil synthesis) gener￾ated by A.S. Ibrahim from R. oryzae 99-880 by chemical mutagenesis. This
mutant exhibited a stable phenotype for uracil auxotrophy even when plat￾ing more than 1 × 109 spores.Organismswere grown on potato dextrose agar
(PDA) for 4 days at 7°C. For M16, PDA wassupplemented with 100 μg/ml
uracil. In some experiments, R. oryzae was starved for iron by growth on
yeast nitrogen base (YNB) (Difco; BD) supplemented with complete sup￾plemental medium without uracil (YNB+CSM-URA; formulation/100 ml,
1.7 g YNB without amino acids, 20 g glucose, 0.77 g CSM-URA) in the
presence of 1 mM of ascorbic acid and ferrozine. The sporangiospores were
collected in endotoxin-free PBS containing 0.01% Tween-80, washed with
PBS, and counted with a hemacytometer to prepare the final inocula.
Effect of deferasirox on the expression of rFTR1. R. oryzae 99-880 plugs taken
from a confluent PDA plate were grown in PDB overnight at 37°C with
shaking. Mycelia were collected aseptically and transferred to fresh PDB
flasks containing 350 μM ferric chloride (to suppress the expression of
rFTR1; ref. 19), 350 μM ferric chloride plus 2 mM deferasirox to test iron
chelation, or 2 mM deferasirox plus 6 mM ferric chloride to supersaturate
the added deferasirox. The flasks were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with
shaking. Mycelia were collected by filtration and ground in liquid nitro￾gen using mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy
Plant Mini kit (QIAGEN) with RLC buffer. The RNA was reverse tran￾scribed with oligo-dT primer using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthe￾sis System (Invitrogen) to generate first-strand cDNA. The products were
diluted and used in PCR to detect the expression of rFTR1 and 18S rDNA
gene. The sequences of the PCR primers were as follows: sense primer 5′-
TCAGAGAAGGACTTGAAGC-3′ and anti-sense primer 5′-TAAGTAGCC￾GTATTGTTCC-3′ for rFTR1 to amplify of R. oryzae (19); and sense primer
5′-CATGGTTGAGATTGTAAGATAG-3′ and anti-sense primer 5′-AGT￾CAATGGACGTGGAGTC-3′ for the 18S rDNA gene. The PCR products
were separated on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bro￾mide. Both primer sets were designed to amplify a 400-bp band.
To study the effect of deferasirox on the expression of rFTR1p, we
used GFP as a reporter system. A 1.5-kb fragment upstream of the rFTR1
ORF was PCR amplified from genomic DNA of strain 99-880 using the
following primer pair: sense primer 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGTCTCAA￾CACCATCAATT-3′; and anti-sense primer 5′-TGCGGCCGTGCTTTT￾TAGTTCTCCTTGGA-3′. A 2.1-kb fragment containing the constitutively
expressed actin promoter was also PCR amplified from genomic DNA of
strain 99-880 to use as a control using the following primer pair: sense,
5′-GCTCTAGATGGTATTATCGATTTAGA-3′; and anti-sense, 5′-GTACG￾GCCGCATACCGGAACCGTTATCG-3′. Amplified fragments were ligated
into the XbaI and EagI sites of plasmid pyr225b (38). GFP was amplified
from pGFPB21-43.31 (39) and cloned downstream of either promoterinto
EagI-SacI sites of the plasmid. Finally, a 2.1-kb fragment representing the
ORF of pyrF and its native promoter was cloned into SpeI-ClaI sites of the
plasmid to serve as a selection marker. Plasmids containing GFP driven
by either rFTR1p or ACT1p were transformed into R. oryzae M16 with
microprojectile particle bombardment (Bio-Rad) (38). Transformants
were selected on YNB+CSM-URA plates grown at 37°C for 5–7 days fol￾lowing bombardment. Isolates were then tested for uracil auxotrophy by
passaging transformants on plates containing minimal medium without
uracil and incubating the plates at 37°C. Purified transformants selected
on uracil-negative plates were analyzed by Southern blotting.
Expression of rFTR1p and ACT1p was studied in transformants grown
in iron-replete medium (i.e., YNB+CSM-URA) or iron-depleted conditions
(i.e., YNB+CSM-URA supplemented with 2 mM deferasirox). Additionally,
to reverse the effect of deferasirox,transformantswere grown in YNB+CSM￾URA supplemented with 2 mM deferasirox and supersaturating 6 mM
ferric chloride. Finally, M16 transformed with empty plasmid (pyr225b￾pyrF without GFP) was used as a negative control. Spores (1 × 104/ml)
were inoculated in the above-mentioned media and incubated overnight at
37°C. A drop of the culture was mounted on a slide, and GFP expression
was visualized in R. oryzae with a Leica DMRXE confocal microscope using
an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Additionally, a 1-mlsample from each
culture was also used to quantify the fluorescence emission using a FACS￾Caliber(BD) flow cytometer. Spores were gated by forward and side scatter
and fluorescence measured in FL1.
Susceptibility testing. MIC and MFC were determined for deferasirox by
the method of Espinel-Ingroff using R. oryzae spores starved for iron
(40). Cidality was defined as difference of less than or equal to 4-fold
between MIC and MFC (40).
Murine models. For in vivo infection, BALB/c male mice (≥20 g) were ren￾dered diabetic with a single i.p. injection of 210 mg/kg streptozotocin in
0.2 ml citrate buffer 10 days prior to fungal challenge (41). Glycosuria and
ketonuria were confirmed in all mice 7 days after streptozotocin treatment.
For the neutropenic mouse model, mice were injected with a single i.p. dose
of 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Bristol-Myers Squibb) 2 days prior to
infection with R. oryzae. This treatment regimen resulted in pancytopenia
from day –2 to day 5 relative to infection, with recovery of cell counts begin￾ning on day 6 after infection (42). To confirm the inocula for i.v. infection,
dilutions were streaked on PDA plates containing 0.1% Triton, and colonies
were counted following a 24-hour incubation period at 37°C. For the intra￾nasal infection, 107 sporesin 20 μl of 0.01% Tween-80 in PBS were placed on
the nostrils of ketamine-sedated (100 mg/kg) mice (43). To confirm the inoc￾ulum, micewere sacrificed immediately afterinhaling R. oryzaespores; lungs
were homogenized and plated on PDA containing 0.1% Triton; and colonies

were counted following incubation at 37°C. For both models, the primary
efficacy endpointwastime to death.Insome experiments, as a secondary end￾point, brain and kidney fungal burden (the primary target organs) (16, 21)
was determined by homogenization by rolling a pipette on organs placed in
Whirl-Pak bags(Nasco) containing 1 mlsaline. The homogenatewasserially
diluted in 0.85% saline and then quantitatively cultured on PDA plates con￾taining 0.1% Triton. Values were expressed aslog10 CFU/g tissue. Finally, for
histopathological analysis,infectedorganswere collectedfrommice andfixed
in 10% zinc formalin. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5-mm
sections were stained with H&E for light microscopy examination.
Treatment regimens. LAmB diluted in 5% dextrose water was obtained
from Gilead and was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg daily via the tail
vein for 4 days. Deferasirox (Novartis) was suspended in 0.5% hydroxypro￾pylcellulose (Klucel; HerculesInc.) and administered by oral gavage at 1, 3,
or 10 mg/kg twice daily or every other day. Treatment was begun 24 hours
after infection and continued for a total of 5 or 7 doses. Control groups
were treated with the diluent, 5% dextrose water, and 0.5% Klucel.
In some experiments, a saturating dose of free iron was administered
with deferasirox. Deferasirox is known to form molecular complexes
with ferric iron (Fe3+) in a 1:2 ratio of iron to deferasirox (13). Based on
the known molecular weights of ferric chloride (FeCl3; molecular weight
162.22 g/mol) and deferasirox (molecularweight 373.4 g/mol), a 2.8-mg/kg
dose of FeCl3 was calculated to result in a significant excess of Fe3+ versus a
10-mg/kgdoseofdeferasiroxgiventoan18-gmouse:Fe3+moles=(0.0028g/kg
× 0.018 kg [mouse wt] / 162.22 g/mol) = 3 × 10–7 mol; versus defera￾sirox moles = (0.01 g/kg × 0.018 kg [mouse wt] / 373.4 g/mol) = 5 × 10–7
mol; ratio = 1:1.7 moles of Fe3+ to deferasirox, which is more than that
required to achieve a saturating 1:2 ratio.
Splenic lymphocyte frequencies and whole-organ cytokines. Splenic Th1
(CD4+IFN-γ+IL-4–) and Th2 (CD4+IFN-γ–IL-4+) lymphocyte frequencies
were determined as we have previously described (44). In brief, splenic
homogenates were passed through 70-μm filters followed by rbc lysis with
0.15 M ammonium chloride. The cells were fixed with Cytofix buffer (BD
Biosciences — Pharmingen), permeabilized with Cytoperm buffer(BD Bio￾sciences — Pharmingen), and stained with 10 μg/ml of FITC-conjugated
anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-5), PE-conjugated anti-mouse IFN-γ (clone
XMG1.2), or isotype control (clone R-34); allophycocyanin-conjugated
(APC-conjugated) anti-mouse IL-4 (clone 11B11) or isotype control (clone
R3-34); or APC-conjugated anti-mouse IL-10 (clone JES5-16E3) or isotype
control (clone A95-1) (all from BD Biosciences — Pharmingen). In separate
experiments, the frequency of CD4+CD25+foxp3+ Tregs was determined
using the Mouse Regulatory T Cell Staining Kit (eBioscience) per the man￾ufacturer’s recommendation. The frequency of apoptosis was determined
using the Annexin FITC Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences — Pharmingen).
Cells were washed, and 3-color flow cytometry was performed on a BD
FACScan instrument calibrated with CaliBRITE beads (BD Biosciences
— Pharmingen) using FACSComp software as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations. During data acquisition, CD4+ lymphocytes were
gated by concatenation of forward and side scatter and FITC–anti-CD4
antibody fluorescence properties. Data for each sample were acquired
until 10,000 CD4+ lymphocytes were analyzed.
Whole-organ cytokines. Spleens and kidneys were homogenized in 1 ml
of PBS. The homogenates were pelleted at maximum speed on a tabletop
centrifuge at 4°C. The supernatants were assayed for cytokines using the
Cytometric Bead Array Murine Inflammatory Cytokine kit (BD Biosci￾ences — Pharmingen) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Deferasirox toxicity studies. Toxicity of deferasirox in neutropenic mice
was evaluated. Mice were rendered neutropenic as described above and
treated with deferasirox at 10 mg/kg twice every day or every other day
for 7 days. Mice from 3 different groups (i.e., placebo, deferasirox daily
treatment, and deferasirox every other day treatment) were sacrificed on
day 3 or 8, and blood was collected and sent to Charles River Laboratories
for evaluation. Additionally, bone marrow smears were prepared from
femurs, and tissues were collected, preserved in zinc-buffered formalin,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with H&E. The
resulting slides were examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist
at Charles River Laboratories.
All proceduresinvolving mice were approved by the institutional animal
use and care committee of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute,
following the NIH guidelines for animal housing and care.
Statistics. The nonparametric log-rank test was used to determine differ￾ences in survival times of the mice. Differences in tissue fungal burdens,
splenic lymphocyte frequencies, and whole-organ cytokinesin the infected
organs were compared by the Mann Whitney U test. P values of less than
0.05 were considered significant.
