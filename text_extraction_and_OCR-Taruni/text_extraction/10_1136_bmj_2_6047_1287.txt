Hypertension after renal transplantation
C BACHY, G P J ALEXANDRE, C VAN YPERSELE DE STRIHOU

Summary
The incidence of hypertension (mean diastolic pressure
above 90 mm Hg) was evaluated in 85 patients with renal
transplants whose follow-up ranged from 3 to 84 months.
Bilateral nephrectomy had been performed in 80
recipients. The proportion of hypertensive subjects rose
during the first three months, subsequently stabilised
around 50-60% for up to five years, and then decreased
slightly during the next two years. Over the years hyper￾tension fluctuated so that one-third of the initially
hypertensive patients became normotensive, and over
one-third of the initially normotensive patients became
hypertensive.
The main single aetiological factor was renal failure.
A significant relation between steroid dosage and blood
pressure was found in only a quarter of the hypertensive
patients, and in another quarter no cause could be found.
Introduction
Although hypertension is a well-known complication of renal
transplantation, its incidence and causes have been evaluated
only in short-term studies soon after the operation.1-6 We
undertook this study, firstly, to assess the incidence of chronic
hypertension up to seven years after renal transplantation and,
secondly, to define its causal factors.
Patients and methods
From 1 January 1968 to 1 January 1973 152 transplantations were
performed in 142 patients. At three months 80% of the grafts were
functioning. Immunosuppressive treatment consisted basically of

azathioprine (2 mg/kg body weight) and prednisolone. Actinomycin C
and antilymphocyte globulins were given to some patients during the
first six months.7
We studied 85 patients (52 males and 33 females) whose ages
ranged from 7 to 55 years (mean 35 5). They had survived with their
first graft for more than three months and were regularly followed up
at our clinic. Patients were seen twice weekly during the first six
months, weekly during the next six months, then twice monthly, and
eventually monthly thereafter. A twice weekly schedule was resumed
when rejection occurred.
The transplant originated from a cadaver in 82 cases and from a
living relative in three cases. Bilateral nephrectomy was performed in
80 recipients.
Patients' charts were reviewed up to January 1976, so that the
potential follow-up ranged from a minimum of 36 months to a
maximum of 96 months. Blood pressure at the end of 1, 2, 3, 6, 12,
18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 months was calculated by averaging the
last five blood pressure readings obtained in the supine position.
Mean diastolic pressures exceeding 90 mm Hg without treatment or
85 mm Hg with a diuretic and a salt-free diet were considered
hypertensive. Mean diastolic pressures exceeding 100 mm Hg without
treatment or 95 mm Hg with a diuretic and a salt-free diet were
considered severely hypertensive.
Graft function was assessed by averaging the values of the last five
serum creatinine determinations obtained at the end of each period.
Total prednisolone dosage during each time interval was calculated
for every patient.
Renal failure had been caused by chronic glomerulonephritis (50
patients), chronic interstitial nephritis including pyelonephritis and
analgesic abuse (29 patients), polycystic kidneys (3 patients), malignant
hypertension (2 patients), and renal tuberculosis (1 patient).
Results
INCIDENCE OF HYPERTENSION
The incidence of hypertension increased over the first three months
and stabilised subsequently at around 50-60% for up to five years
after transplantation. It fell thereafter to 40%. Slightly fewer than
half the hypertensive patients suffered from severe hypertension
(table I).
EVOLUTION OF HYPERTENSION
The stability of hypertension was assessed in 58 patients whose
grafts functioned for at least 36 months. Of 31 patients who were
normotensive at three months, 14 had become hypertensive at 36
months. Conversely, of the 27 patients who were hypertensive at
three months, nine had become normotensive at 36 months.

CAUSES OF HYPERTENSION
Adrenal steroids-The relation between diastolic blood pressure
and steroid dosage was assessed at three months because the variation
in the daily prednisolone dose was at its greatest at that time, ranging
from 8-5 to 70 mg. No statistically significant correlation was obtained
either in the whole group or in any subgroup defined by diastolic
pressure, renal function, or both (table III). The part played by
steroids in hypertension was further assessed by comparing mean
prednisolone dosage in the nine patients who remained hypertensive
and in the nine patients who remained normotensive for 60 months.
No difference was seen in the mean dosage calculated either over the
first 12 months or over 60 months (table II). Finally, the influence
of steroids on blood pressure was evaluated in 45 patients whose
follow-up had lasted at least 36 months and whose diastolic blood
pressure and daily prednisolone dose had varied over this time by at
least 10 mm Hg and 15 mg respectively. A statistically significant

positive correlation (P < 0 05) between the two indices was found in
only 12 patients.
Renal function-The mean serum creatinine level was consistently
higher in the hypertensive patients than in the normotensive patients,
but this difference was statistically significant only at 72 months
(table IV). When only severe hypertension was taken into account the
difference was even more striking, being significant from 18 months
onwards. The relation between renal failure and severe hypertension
was further illustrated by the observation that the number of patients
with an abnormal serum creatinine concentration (> 106 tsmol/l
(> 1-2 mg/100 ml) ) was significantly higher in the severely hyperten￾sive than in the normotensive group (13 out of 18 v 11 out of 28 at
12 months and 5 out of 5 v 8 out of 17 at 60 months; P<0-05 (X2
test) ). Patients with mild hypertension behaved like the normo￾tensive subjects. We found no difference between the hypertensive and
normotensive patients in the number of episodes of acute rejection
undergone during the first year (mean 17 and 1-4 episodes respec￾tively). Respectively, 69°h and 62% in each group suffered at least
one rejection episode.
Renal artery stenosis-Renal arteriography was performed in five
of the 85 patients. Renal artery stenosis was found in two. In the
other three patients diffuse lesions of the primary and secondary
division branches of the renal artery were found.

Discussion
A high incidence of hypertension, ranging from 30 to 80%
has been reported within two to 12 months after transplant￾ation.2-6 We have extended these observations by showing that
about half of a large series of patients were hypertensive up
to six years after transplantation.
Interestingly, the stability of the incidence of hypertension
over the years was only apparent, as blood pressure had returned
to normal by three years in a third of the patients who were
hypertensive at three months, whereas over a third of the
initially normotensive subjects had become hypertensive by
three years. As a result, although never more than 66% of the
patients had hypertension at any one time, 82% of all trans￾planted patients were hypertensive at one time or another
during follow-up.
The causes of hypertension in renal transplant recipients are
multiple. Our data suggest that, contrary to previous findings,5
the dose of corticosteroids is not by itself an important factor.
A significant correlation between blood pressure and steroid
dosage was found during follow-up in only a quarter of the
hypertensive patients. Three months after transplantation no
relation was found between steroid dose and diastolic blood
pressure-an observation that agrees with others.24 Finally,
there was no significant difference in the steroid intake of
patients whose blood pressure remained consistently raised over
five years compared with values in patients with normal pressures
over five years. The patients' own kidneys1 6 could not be
incriminated because 80 of the 85 patients had undergone
bilateral nephrectomy. Renal artery stenosis was observed in
only two patients, but renal angiography was performed only in
patients with severe refractory hypertension. In a prospective
study,8 incidences as high as 23% were reported, though renal
artery stenosis was also noted in normotensive patients, which
underlines the fact that the association between renal artery
stenosis and hypertension may not always be causal. At the very
least, our data suggest that renal artery stenosis is not a common
cause of hypertension after renal transplantation.
In our series renal failure was the most significant factor
associated with the development of hypertension, especially
among severely hypertensive patients. Many more of the patients
with severe hypertension had an abnormal creatinine concentra￾tion, and the mean concentration in this group was significantly
higher than that of the normotensive patients.
Our data should not obscure the fact that 20-25% of hyper￾tensive patients had both normal renal function and a daily
steroid dose of 10 mg or less 24 to 60 months after transplanta￾tion. Smellie et al9 and Malekzadeh et al'0 have also reported
hypertension in transplanted patients with a normal renal
function. Arteriography in some of their patients showed
intrarenal arterial lesions that were tentatively attributed to
subclinical rejection episodes. Similar lesions might have
caused hypertension in some of our patients. They might have
accounted for the progressive slow decrease in renal function
observed over five years in four constantly hypertensive patients,
a finding in sharp contrast with the stability of renal function in
nine other patients whose blood pressure remained normal
over the same period. Alternatively, the possibility that essential
hypertension develops in a population of young adults should
be considered despite our finding that age bore no relation
to the frequency of hypertension at one year. Similarly, hyper￾tension was no more prevalent in the patients whose original
illness had been complicated by hypertension than in those who
had remained normotensive. Finally, Bianchi et all' have
provided experimental evidence suggesting the intriguing
possibility that the transplanted kidney, coming from a donor
with a family history of essential hypertension, might transmit
this tendency to the recipient. The evaluation of these hypo￾theses will require further investigations.
