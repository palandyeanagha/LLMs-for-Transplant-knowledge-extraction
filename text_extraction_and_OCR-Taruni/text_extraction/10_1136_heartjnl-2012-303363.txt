Risk assessment in hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy: contemporary
guidelines hampered by insufficient
evidence
Pascal P McKeown,1,2 Alison Rachel Muir2
If it were not for the great variability
among individuals, medicine might as
well be a science and not an art. (Sir
William Osler, 1892)
The sudden unexpected death of an individ￾ual at any age has a profound effect on the
family and the wider community and this is
particularly significant when it affects a
young person. Hypertrophic cardiomyop￾athy remains one of the common causes of
sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young indivi￾duals.1 In a cohort of 744 patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from the
USA and Italy, where 86 (12%) died over an
8 (SD±7) year period of follow-up, three
main modes of death were identified:
sudden and unexpected (found mainly but
not exclusively in adolescents and young
adults); heart failure; and stroke, usually
associated with the development of atrial
fibrillation.2 The most common underlying
pathophysiological mechanism leading to
sudden death is the development of ven￾tricular tachyarrhythmias occurring on a
background of myocyte disarray, interstitial
fibrosis, and arteriolar changes with con￾tributory ischaemic and autonomic effects.1
Abnormalities of intercalated discs and gap
junctions have also been reported.3 An inte￾gral component of clinical investigation and
management of patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy is the assessment of risk of
sudden death, as those individuals with a
perceived significantly increased risk may be
considered for prophylactic implantable car￾dioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation.
The estimated prevalence of hyper￾trophic cardiomyopathy is 1 in 500 but
many individuals have a subclinical
phenotype. Many patients with this con￾dition have an excellent prognosis similar
to that of the background population and
these individuals are characterised by the
absence of major risk factors for sudden
death.4 Several risk factors for sudden
death have been identified.1 5 The gener￾ally accepted major risk factors include:
family history of sudden death; unex￾plained syncope; non-sustained ventricu￾lar tachycardia (NSVT) on ambulatory
monitoring; severe hypertrophy
(≥30 mm); and abnormal blood pressure
response to exercise (although this risk
may be relevant only in those under the
age of 40 years).6 7 Additional ‘risk modi￾fiers’ have also been reported and include
the presence of significant left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), sig￾nificant late gadolinium enhancement
(LGE) on cardiac MRI scanning and ‘high
risk’ genotype, as well as other less com￾monly seen complications, such as
exercise-induced ventricular tachyarrhyth￾mias, the presence of a left ventricular
aneurysm and late systolic dysfunction.1 5
There are difficulties, however, in the
interpretation of these risk factors in the
context of an individual patient with hyper￾trophic cardiomyopathy. Of note, many
publications relating to risk assessment in
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have come
from a limited number of centres where
there may have been both a referral and
ascertainment bias—patients attending these
regional centres are likely to have had a
more severe expression of phenotype,
leading to early reports suggesting that there
was a high risk (up to 6% per year) of
sudden death.1 Some risk factors have
shown statistical significance on univariate
but not multivariate analysis, leading to the
ACCF/AHA guidelines ‘downgrading’
NSVT and BP response to exercise as only
being of significance if observed in the
context of other major risk factors.7
Various authors have also used different
definitions of individual risk factors. As a
simple illustration, how does one define a
family history of sudden death? In the
papers which were quoted in a recent
meta-analysis,8 a family history of prema￾ture SCD was defined in several different
ways, including SCD in a first degree rela￾tive, SCD in ≥2 relatives <40 years, SCD
in ≥2 first degree relatives <40 years, and
SCD in ≥1 relatives with hypertrophic car￾diomyopathy or SCD in ≥1 close relatives
without the diagnosis of hypertrophic car￾diomyopathy <50 years, leaving the clin￾ician in some difficulty when interpreting
whether or not a family history is indeed
significant. The 2011 ACCF/AHA guide￾lines7 make a class IIa recommendation
that it is reasonable to recommend an ICD
for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients
with a family history of SCD presumed
due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in
one or more first-degree relatives;
however, this implies that, if an individual
in a family dies due to hypertrophic car￾diomyopathy, all surviving affected family
members may be offered an ICD irrespect￾ive of their phenotype, an approach which
seems rather alarmist.
The newer ‘risk modifiers’ also pose
clinical dilemmas. Some studies have
shown higher rates of SCD among patients
with resting LVOTO, with reduction in
risk following relief of obstruction via sur￾gical myectomy.9 Fibrosis on histological
examination is a common finding in hyper￾trophic cardiomyopathy and it was initially
reported that the presence of LGE on MRI
scanning was a risk factor for SCD.
However, LGE has been reported in over
60% of patients with hypertrophic cardio￾myopathy, is particularly common in those
with extensive hypertrophy, and does
appear to be associated with an increased
risk of ventricular arrhythmias but is not
consistently independently associated with
an increased risk for SCD.10 11 To date,
studies have been underpowered and have
shown significant heterogeneity.12 13
Some early reports had suggested that
there may be a link between genotype and
sudden death, in particular with variants
in the troponin T gene,14 but more
recently, patients with troponin T muta￾tions were found to have rates of SCD
similar to those reported in large referral
populations.15 On the other hand, some
patients who are genotype positive but do
not express any hypertrophy, also carry
risk factors for SCD.16 It is increasingly
recognised that 5–10% of patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have more
than one pathogenic variant (with com￾pound or double heterozygosity associated
with a more severe expression of pheno￾type), with some studies suggesting an
increased rate of SCD.17

It is clear that standard programmed
ventricular stimulation is not a useful
investigation in risk assessment.1 More
complex electrophysiological assessment,
using techniques such as electrogram frac￾tionation, may offer additional prognostic
information, but the technique is invasive
and there are limited datasets available.18
The main therapeutic option for reduc￾tion of sudden death is ICD implantation,
but complications from these devices,
including acute complications relating
to the implant procedure, inappropriate
shocks, lead failure, and long-term psy￾chological effects are increasingly recog￾nised. There is also some difficulty in
determining whether or not an ICD dis￾charge was lifesaving, as it is possible that
some arrhythmias terminated by an ICD
shock may have terminated spontaneously.
The Heart Rhythm UK group has sug￾gested that patients should have an SCD
risk of ≥1% per year before considering
ICD implantation.19 There is also the
issue of the unpredictable timing of when
a patient may require an ICD shock—in a
modest number of patients there may be
many years between ICD implant and first
discharge. Decisions about implantation
in young people are complex as they have
most to lose in the setting of SCD, yet
they wish to lead active lives but encoun￾ter devices with limited battery life and
lead problems, leading to multiple inva￾sive procedures over a lifetime. Schinkel
et al have undertaken a meta-analysis and
reported an overall low cardiac mortality
after ICD implantation.20 While the
appropriate intervention rate was ∼3.3%,
inappropriate interventions and complica￾tions were not uncommon (4.8% and 3.4%
per year, respectively). Newer devices,
which do not require intravascular access,
may be useful but there are only a small
number of published studies.21
In the study by O’Mahony et al,
22 the
dataset from a cohort of 1606 patients
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy evalu￾ated at their centre was analysed using the
guideline documents issued in 2003 and
2011.6 7 During the study period (median
6.6 years, IQR 4.1–10.0), 302 patients
received an ICD. The primary endpoint
of SCD was defined as one of the follow￾ing: witnessed or aborted SCD with or
without documented ventricular fibrilla￾tion; death within 1 h of symptoms; noc￾turnal death with no antecedent history of
worsening symptoms; or an appropriate
ICD shock for ventricular tachycardia or
fibrillation. They identified that the risk of
SCD increased with multiple risk factors
but not with a single risk factor. The area
under the receiver operating characteristic
curves at 1 and 5 years based on the two
main algorithms ranged from 0.61 to 0.64
and, as such, had limited power to distin￾guish high risk from low risk individuals. As
has been previously noted, the positive pre￾dictive accuracy of these risk algorithms is
low, whereas the negative predictive value is
good. It is important to note that the major￾ity of events still occur in those perceived to
be at low risk. This study, therefore, pro￾vides some evidence to suggest that the
2011 guidelines do not really help to distin￾guish high from low risk candidates.
It is important to remember that cur￾rently available algorithms classify risk
factors as dichotomous variables, and
these authors comment: ‘it is implausible
that a maximal wall thickness of 29 mm
confers a significantly different risk than a
value of 30 mm’.
22 They recognise that
risk factors are not static and may change
with time but they do not address the issue
of ‘gathering risk’. In this paper there was
a single assessment of risk at baseline but
it is important to remember that, over
time, individuals may acquire additional
risk factors with changes in symptoms,
family history or follow-up investigations.
Current guidelines recommend assessment
at initial evaluation and on a period
follow-up basis of 12–24 months.7
However, if two risk factors are ‘gathered’
at separate visits, the impact of this is
unclear. In addition, it is important to note
that many of the published datasets on risk
factors are based on ‘relative’ rather than
an accurate ‘absolute’ risk calculation.
It is also striking to note that the evidence
base cited in the 2011 consensus document
is mainly at level B or C.7 There is a clear
need for more evidence and longer term
follow up to assess the usefulness of these
algorithms. In view of the wide phenotypic
expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
future studies should include information
from cohorts of patients, which are repre￾sentative of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
patients in the general population.1 This
will require international collaboration as
well as the use of high quality registry data,
an issue which has been recognised recently
by the European Society of Cardiology.23
Ultimately, it requires expert input from the
cardiology team and clear communication
with an informed patient to ensure that
both the art and science of medicine are uti￾lised in the best interests of the patient.
