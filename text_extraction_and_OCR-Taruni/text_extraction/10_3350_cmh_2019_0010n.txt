PREAMBLE
Background and aims
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis with complications have 
a very poor prognosis and require careful management. Varices 
are common complications in patients with cirrhosis. Although 
the prognosis of variceal bleeding has improved with recent ad￾vances in diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rate remains 12–
22%. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is known to occur in 10–14% 
of patients with cirrhosis and 16–21% of patients with decom￾pensated cirrhosis. More than 20% of cirrhotic patients who visit 
emergency rooms in Korea present with HE. Therefore, cirrhosis is 
a serious disease in Korea and requires specific Korean guidelines 
for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. In 2005, the Korean As￾sociation for the Study of the Liver (KASL) enacted a clinical prac￾tice guideline (CPG) for the treatment of cirrhosis complications 
including ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, varices, and HE. In 2011, 
the guidelines for the treatment of cirrhosis were revised to inte￾grate antifibrotic treatment and update the diagnosis and treat￾ment advice for variceal bleeding, cirrhotic ascites, and HE. In 
2017, the CPG for liver cirrhosis was revised for ascites and related 
complications. At this time, KASL is revising the CPG for liver cir￾rhosis to address varices and HE following ascites and related 
complications. To date, many studies have addressed the preven￾tion and treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and HE, 
and many guidelines have been based on those studies, but most 
of them contain foreign data that are difficult to apply to Korean 
KASL clinical practice guidelines for liver cirrhosis:

clinical practice. Therefore, these revised guidelines for the treat￾ment of varices and HE are offered for Korean practice to reflect 
the latest research results and extensive discussions within the re￾vision committee. This guideline contains the opinions of experts 
and is intended to be a practical reference for the care of patients 
with varices and HE; it is not an absolute standard of care. The 
best choices for each patient’s care vary from case to case, and 
the judgment of the doctor in charge is important. As medical evi￾dence and new findings accumulate in the future, these guidelines 
will require ongoing supplementation and revision. This guideline 
may not be modified or altered without permission.
Target population
This guideline discusses patients with varices, HE, and related 
complications (esophageal varices [EVs] and bleeding, gastric vari￾ces and bleeding, portal hypertensive gastropathy, covert and 
overt HE) caused by liver cirrhosis. It is intended for clinicians and 
other medical personnel who are in charge of diagnosing and 
treating patients with liver cirrhosis. This guideline is also intend￾ed to provide practical clinical and educational information and 
directions for resident physicians and fellows in training, practitio￾ners, and their trainers and supervisors.
Development, funding, and revision process
Comprising 14 hepatologists, the Clinical Practice Guideline 
Committee for Liver Cirrhosis: Varices, HE, and related complica￾tions (the Committee) was organized by the KASL Board of Execu￾tives. Funding for the revisions was provided by KASL. Each com￾mittee member collected and analyzed source data in his or her 
own field, and the members then wrote the manuscript together. 
Literature review
The Committee selected keywords and questions using PICO 
(Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) assess￾ments and systematically collected and reviewed international 
and domestic literature available in PubMed, MEDLINE, Kore￾aMed, the Korean Medical Database, and other databases. In ad￾dition to published articles, abstracts of important meetings pub￾lished before January 2019 were evaluated.
Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation
The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, 
and Evaluation (GRADE) system (Table 1) was applied to grade 
the evidence and recommendations. The levels of evidence are 
based on the possibility of change in the estimate of clinical effect 
by further research and are described as high (A), moderate (B), 
or low (C). The recommendations are also classified as strong (1) 
or weak (2) by the GRADE system based on the quality of evi￾dence, the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects 
of an intervention, generalizability, and socioeconomic aspects 
(including cost and availability). Each recommendation is labeled 
with the level of relevant evidence (A–C) and corresponding rec￾ommendation grade (1, 2) as follows: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2.

Review of the manuscript and approval process
Each manuscript written by members was reviewed and ap￾proved through meetings of the Committee. An updated manu￾script was reviewed at a meeting of the advisory board and 
opened to a public hearing attended by KASL members, members 
of related organizations, and representatives from patient associa￾tions. The final manuscript was approved by the KASL Board of 
Executives.
Release of the guidelines and plan for updates
The revised guideline (The KASL Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
Liver Cirrhosis: Varices, Hepatic Encephalopathy and Related 
Complications) was released at a KASL meeting on 22 June 2019. 
The Korean version of the guideline is available on the KASL web￾site (http://www.kasl.org). 
Varices
Varices are a frequent complication of liver cirrhosis and a lead￾ing cause of mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. Varices were 
present in 52.2% of patients who received endoscopy for variceal 
screening,1
 and the incidence of varices was significantly higher in 
patients with Child-Pugh class B/C than in those with Child-Pugh 
class A (35–43% vs. 48–72%).1,2 Portal hypertension, which is

Quality of evidence
High (A) Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate (B) Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and could 
change the estimate.
Low (C) Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is 
likely to change the estimate. Any change in estimate is uncertain.
Strength of recommendation
Strong (1) Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, presumed 
patient-important outcomes, and cost.
Weak (2) Variability in preference and values or relatively high uncertainty. Recommendation is made with less 
certainty or higher cost or resource consumption.
Of the quality levels of evidence, we excluded “very low quality (D),” which was originally included in the GRADE system, for convenience. (Guyatt GH, Oxman

the most common complication of liver cirrhosis, is the main de￾terminant in the development of varices. Increased intrahepatic 
vascular resistance to portal flow leads to the development of 
portal hypertension, which is aggravated by splanchnic vasodila￾tation and an increase in portal blood flow caused by hyperdy￾namic circulation.3-5 When the portal pressure increases above a 
threshold, collaterals develop at the site of communication be￾tween the portal and systemic circulation, of which varices are the 
most important. With the aggravation of portal hypertension, the 
collaterals grow and eventually rupture. Bleeding from varices is a 
major complication of portal hypertension and a leading cause of 
mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, preventing 
variceal development and progression, preventing bleeding from 
varices, appropriately managing acute bleeding from varices, and 
preventing variceal rebleeding are critical in patients with liver cir￾rhosis.
The incidence of varices in cirrhotic patients without varices at 
baseline is 5–9% at 1 year and 14–17% at 2 years.6,7 The main 
risk factor for variceal development in these patients is a higher 
hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG).6
 Small EVs often prog￾ress to large varices; the incidence of progression from small to 
large EVs is 12% at 1 year and 25% at 2 years. The independent 
risk factors of EV progression are alcoholic cirrhosis, decompen￾sated disease, and splenomegaly.7
 The 1-year incidence of variceal 
bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and varices without a previous 
history of bleeding is approximately 12% (5% for small varices 
and 15% for large varices), and the main risk factors of bleeding 
are larger varices, the presence of redness over the varices, and 
decompensated disease.8
 Although the mortality rate has de￾creased significantly during the past several decades thanks to 
improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities,9,10 it re￾mains as high as 12–22%.11-14 In addition, rebleeding is frequent, 
up to 60% within 1 year, without appropriate treatment to pre￾vent it.15
Surveillance of varices
Endoscopic surveillance of varices
Given the high prevalence of varices and poor prognosis with 
variceal bleeding, monitoring varices is important in patients with 
liver cirrhosis. Therefore, upon first diagnosis with liver cirrhosis, 
endoscopy should be performed to look for varices and assess the 
risk of bleeding. Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis is not difficult in pa￾tients with decompensated liver cirrhosis accompanied by ascites 
or variceal bleeding, but a liver biopsy is needed to diagnose pa￾tients with compensated cirrhosis who have no clinical symptoms 
or signs. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure with a risk 
of serious complications.16 Furthermore, doubt has been cast on 
the accuracy of liver biopsy because of the risk of sampling er￾rors17,18 and intra- and interobserver variability.18,19
Liver cirrhosis can disappear with appropriate treatment of the 
underlying liver disease,20,21 though portal hypertension can ac￾company the severe stage of fibrosis (F3).22,23 Various practice 
guidelines recommend surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma 
in patients with liver fibrosis, even before the development of cir￾rhosis.24,25 Therefore, the alternative term compensated advanced 
chronic liver disease (cACLD) has been proposed for patients with 
severe fibrosis (F3) and compensated liver cirrhosis to better re￾flect that the spectrum of severe fibrosis and cirrhosis is a contin￾uum in asymptomatic patients and that distinguishing between 
these two conditions is often clinically impossible.26 A liver stiff￾ness value, measured by transient elastography, of <10 kPa can 
rule out cACLD, and a value between 10 and 15 kPa is suggestive 
of cACLD but needs further tests for confirmation. A value >15 
kPa is highly suggestive of cACLD.26 Endoscopic surveillance of all 
patients with cACLD can cause problems, such as an increase in 
medical costs due to an increase in unnecessary tests. Therefore, 
noninvasive screening tests have been proposed for patients with 
EVs, especially those whose EVs have a high risk of bleeding, to 
reduce unnecessary endoscopic surveillance. The Baveno VI crite￾ria suggest that endoscopic surveillance can be avoided in cACLD 
patients with a liver stiffness <20 kPa and a platelet count 
>150×109
/L because they are at very low risk for varices that need 
to be treated.26 Augustin et al.27 expanded the Baveno VI criteria 
to say that endoscopic surveillance can be avoided in cACLD pa￾tients with liver stiffness <25 kPa and a platelet count >110×109
/L. 
However, considering that noninvasive screening for varices that 
need to be treated is not particularly reliable28,29 and endoscopy is 
more easily accessed in Korea than in Western countries, we do 
not deem screening by noninvasive test to be useful in Korea.
Surveillance of EVs
The incidence of EV development in cirrhotic patients without 
varices is 5–9% at 1 year and 14–17% at 2 years.6,7 Small EVs 
progress to large varices at the rate of 12% after 1 year and 25% 
after 2 years.7
 Therefore, endoscopic surveillance should be per￾formed more frequently in patients with small EVs than in those 
without EVs. In addition, because the type of underlying liver dis￾ease (e.g., alcoholic cirrhosis) and liver function (e.g., decompen￾sated cirrhosis) are risk factors for the progression of EVs, they

should be taken into account when determining the surveillance 
interval. Endoscopic surveillance should be performed at 2–3-year 
intervals in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and at 1–2-
year intervals in those with decompensated liver cirrhosis.30,31
EVs can be classified as large or small according to their size, 
with a breakpoint at 5 mm in diameter,32 or they can be classified 
as F1 (linearly dilated, small and straight varices), F2 (beady vari￾ces, tortuous and occupying less than one third of the esophageal 
lumen), or F3 (nodular varices, large and occupying more than 
one third of the esophageal lumen).33 However, because the F2 
and F3 classifications are fairly subjective and prophylactic treat￾ment is recommended both for F2 and F3, F1 is usually classified 
as small, and F2 and F3 are classified together as large.
[Recommendations] 
1. In patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, screening endoscopy 
is recommended to determine the presence of varices and 
assess the risk of bleeding. (A1)
2. In endoscopy, EVs are classified as small (F1) and large (F2 or 
F3), and the presence of redness should be evaluated. (B1)
3. To identify the development and progression of EVs, 
endoscopic surveillance should be performed at 2–3-year 
intervals in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and 
at 1–2-year intervals in those with decompensated liver 
cirrhosis. The frequency of endoscopic surveillance could be 
modified according to the type and severity of underlying liver 
disease. (B1)
Preventing the formation and progression of EVs
Appropriate treatment for the underlying liver disease can im￾prove liver fibrosis, which could improve portal hypertension and 
prevent the development of complications. In patients with hepa￾titis B virus-related liver cirrhosis, the cirrhosis disappeared from 
the liver biopsy reports of 74% after 5 years of treatment with te￾nofovir disoproxil fumarate,20 and in a meta-analysis, hepatic his￾tologic improvement was observed in chronic hepatitis C patients 
treated with pegylated interferon±ribavirin.34 In an earlier study 
of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the degree of 
weight loss correlated with the degree of histologic improve￾ment.35 Furthermore, the incidence of EVs was significantly lower 
in patients with a sustained virologic response (SVR) to pegylated 
interferon+ribavirin treatment than in those without an SVR.36-38
In a recent study, portal pressure was significantly lower in pa￾tients with an SVR to direct-acting agents than in those without 
an SVR in patients with hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhosis.39
Because the development of GEVs is a direct consequence of 
portal hypertension, reducing the portal pressure through the use 
of nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) from the early stage of liver 
cirrhosis could theoretically ameliorate the formation of GEVs. 
However, a placebo-controlled study to determine whether NSBBs 
could prevent the formation of varices in 213 patients with cirrho￾sis and portal hypertension without GEVs, the incidence of varices 
or bleeding from varices did not differ between timolol group and 
the placebo group (39% vs. 40%, P=0.89), and serious adverse 
events developed more frequently in the timolol group than the 
placebo group (18% vs. 6%, P=0.006).6
 Therefore, the use of NS￾BBs to prevent the formation of varices is not recommended.
Several studies have evaluated whether NSBBs can prevent or 
delay the growth of small varices, and the results conflict. One 
study found a significant reduction in the rate of progression to 
large EVs in the nadolol group compared with the placebo group 
in patients with cirrhosis and small EVs (7% vs. 31% at 2 years, 
20% vs. 51% at 5 years; P<0.001),40 but another study showed 
that propranolol offered no benefit for the prevention of progres￾sion to large varices (23% in the propranolol group vs. 19% in the 
placebo group, P=0.786), even though the reduction in portal 
pressure was significantly greater in the propranolol group.41 A re￾cent meta-analysis suggests that NSBBs are not effective in pre￾venting the progression from small to large varices.42 Another 
study found that the incidence of progression to large varices 
across 24 months was significantly lower in the carvedilol group 
than the placebo group (20.6% vs. 38.6%, P=0.04), leading 
those researchers to suggest that carvedilol is a safe and effective 
way to delay the progression of small to large EVs in patients with 
cirrhosis.43
Carvedilol reduces portal pressure by means of an anti-a1-medi￾ated decrease in intrahepatic resistance and splanchnic vasocon￾striction. Because intrahepatic vasoconstriction is the main patho￾logic mechanism in the development of portal hypertension 
during early-stage liver cirrhosis, it could be more effective than 
other medications in preventing the progression of varices in pa￾tients with early-stage cirrhosis.44 However, further studies are 
needed to confirm the effects of carvedilol.

[Recommendations] 
1. Appropriate treatment for the underlying liver disease is 
recommended to prevent the formation of EVs. (A1)
2. NSBBs (propranolol and nadolol) are not recommended to 
prevent the formation of EVs in cirrhotic patients without EVs. 
(A1)
3. ‌‌ In patients with small EVs that are not red, NSBBs (propranolol 
and nadolol) or carvedilol could be considered to prevent the 
progression of EVs. (B2)
Prevention of first variceal bleeding in patients with 
EVs
In patients with liver cirrhosis and EVs, variceal bleeding occurs 
at a yearly rate of 5–15% of cases. Active prevention of the first 
variceal bleeding is indicated in patients at a high risk of bleeding, 
such as patients with large varices (F2, F3), decompensated cir￾rhosis, or varices with red color signs on endoscopy.8,45
Prevention of first variceal bleeding in patients with small 
EVs
In cirrhotic patients with small EVs, the risk of bleeding is low 
(3% at 2 years and 8% at 4 years) and remains low in patients 
whose varices remain small at the follow-up endoscopy, though it 
increases significantly when the varices become large. An increase 
in Child-Pugh score during follow-up appears to be a significant 
predictor of enlarged varices and thus an increase in bleeding 
risk.46 The prevention of first bleeding in patients with small EVs 
depends on their risk of bleeding. Patients with small varices with 
red color signs on endoscopy or decompensated cirrhosis have an 
increased risk of bleeding and should consider using NSBBs.26,47
Prevention of first variceal bleeding in patients with large 
EVs
NSBBs and EVL
Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have 
shown that the use of NSBBs can prevent first variceal bleeding in 
cirrhotic patients with large EVs.48,49 A study comparing NSBBs 
and EVL as primary prophylaxis in patients with high-risk EVs 
found no significant difference between them in bleeding rates 
(relative risk [RR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55–
1.35).50 A meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating the efficacy of EVL 
and pharmacological therapy in preventing first EV bleeding in 
patients with cirrhosis also found no significant difference in the 
rate of variceal bleeding between the two groups.51 Another me￾ta-analysis found that EVL significantly reduced the rate of first 
variceal bleeding and severe adverse events than NSBBs in pa￾tients with large EVs.52 Thus, in most studies, the efficacy of EVL 
in preventing first variceal bleeding was similar to that of NSBBs, 
and in some studies, the efficacy of EVL was superior to NSBBs. 
Therefore, either NSBBs or EVL is recommended for the preven￾tion of first variceal bleeding in patients with large EVs. The 
choice of treatment should be based on clinician expertise and 
patient preference, characteristics, contraindications, and adverse 
events.26,47
Carvedilol
Carvedilol is known to be more effective in reducing portal 
pressure than propranolol.53-55 In a multicenter RCT comparing the 
efficacy of carvedilol and EVL in preventing first variceal bleeding 
in cirrhotic patients with large EVs, carvedilol had lower rates of 
first variceal bleeding (10% vs. 23%, P=0.04), but there was no 
significant difference in overall mortality or bleeding-related mor￾tality during follow up.56 In another RCT comparing the efficacy of 
carvedilol and EVL for primary prophylaxis of EV bleeding, the 
carvedilol and EVL groups had comparable variceal bleeding rates 
(8.5% vs. 6.9%, P=0.61).57 In a study assessing the efficacy of 
carvedilol, propranolol, and EVL for the primary prevention of var￾iceal bleeding in patients with large varices, no significant differ￾ences among the groups were found in the risk of bleeding 
(15.4% vs. 10.8% vs. 10.2%, P=0.071), but the incidence of ad￾verse events was the highest in the propranolol group.58 In studies 
comparing the efficacy of carvedilol, NSBBs, and EVL for the pri￾mary prevention of EV bleeding, carvedilol was similar to NSBBs 
and EVL or superior to EVL. Therefore, carvedilol can also be used 
to prevent first variceal bleeding in patients with high-risk EVs.
Combination therapy of EVL and NSBBs 
The combination of EVL and NSBBs for the primary prophylaxis 
of variceal bleeding could have a synergistic effect from the direct 
eradication of varices by EVL and the reduction of portal pressure 
by NSBBs. Several studies have compared the efficacy of combi￾nation therapy with that of monotherapy based on that hypothe￾sis. In RCTs comparing EVL plus propranolol with EVL alone for 
preventing first variceal bleeding in patients with high-risk EVs, 
the combination therapy did not show any difference from EVL 
alone in first bleed occurrence or mortality during follow up. How￾ever, the recurrence of varices was lower in the combination

group than in the EVL alone group.59,60 No difference in the rate 
of first variceal bleeding was also found between EVL plus nado￾lol combination therapy and nadolol alone (14% vs. 13%, 
P=0.90).61 However, another study reported that EVL and pro￾pranolol combination therapy lowered the rate of first variceal 
bleeding compared with propranolol alone (6% vs. 31%, 
P=0.03).62 Because most studies have shown that EVL and NSBBs 
combination therapy for the primary prophylaxis of EV bleeding 
do not differ in bleeding rate or mortality compared with mono￾therapy, combination therapy is generally not recommended. 
However, some studies have reported that EVL and NSBBs combi￾nation therapy reduced the rate of first variceal bleeding and vari￾ceal recurrence compared with monotherapy. Therefore, combina￾tion therapy can be considered in selected patients. A recent 
meta-analysis of RCTs showed that combination therapy with EVL 
and NSBBs reduced the rate of first variceal bleeding compared 
with placebo and isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN).63
ISMN
In an RCT of cirrhotic patients with EVs, the ISMN group and 
propranolol group had no significant difference in bleeding rate, 
but the mortality rate during follow up was higher in the ISMN 
group (72.3% vs. 47.8% at 6 years, P=0.006).64 In a multicenter 
RCT comparing EVL, propranolol, and ISMN, the EVL and pro￾pranolol groups did not differ significantly, but the EVL group had 
a significantly lower rate of first variceal bleeding than the ISMN 
group (7.5% vs. 33% at 2 years, P=0.03).65 A multicenter RCT 
compared propranolol plus placebo with propranolol plus ISMN 
for the prevention of EV bleeding. The rate of first variceal bleed￾ing did not differ significantly between the groups (10.6% vs. 
12.5% at 2 years, P>0.05).66 Therefore, ISMN alone or in combi￾nation with NSBBs is not recommended for the prevention of first 
variceal bleeding.
Treatment practices for the prevention of first esophageal 
variceal bleeding 
NSBBs
The advantages of NSBBs include low cost, ease of administra￾tion, and not requiring follow-up endoscopies. Propranolol is 
started at 20–40 mg twice a day and adjusted every 2–3 days until 
the treatment goal (resting heart rate of 55–60 beats per minute) 
is achieved. The maximum dose is 320 mg daily in patients with￾out ascites and 160 mg daily in patients with ascites. Nadolol is 
started at 20–40 mg once a day and adjusted every 2–3 days un￾til the treatment goal is achieved. The maximum dose is 160 mg 
daily in patients without ascites and 80 mg daily in patients with 
ascites. Systolic blood pressure should not decrease <90 mmHg.47
The disadvantages of NSBBs are that about 15% of patients 
have contraindications to therapy, and another 15% or so require 
dose reduction or discontinuation because of side effects.47 Con￾traindications to NSBBs include sinus bradycardia, insulin-depen￾dent diabetes mellitus, obstructive pulmonary disease, heart fail￾ure, aortic valve disease, second- or third-degree atrioventricular 
heart block, and peripheral arterial insufficiency.67 Side effects of 
NSBBs include dizziness, fatigue, general weakness, dyspnea, 
headache, hypotension, bradycardia, and erectile dysfunc￾tion.47,58,66,67 Discontinuing NSBBs can increase the risk of variceal 
bleeding and mortality. Thus, treatment with NSBBs should be 
continued indefinitely.68,69 In patients with contraindications or 
discontinuation due to severe side effects or poor compliance 
with NSBBs, EVL is recommended.68
In patients with end-stage liver disease, such as refractory asci￾tes or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the administration of NS￾BBs has not yet been established. In cirrhotic patients with refrac￾tory ascites, the use of NSBBs can lower arterial pressure, 
decrease survival time,70 and increase the risk of paracentesis-in￾duced circulatory dysfunction.71 In addition, among patients with 
cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, NSBBs increase 
the risk of hepatorenal syndrome and acute kidney injury and re￾duce survival time.72 However, other studies have reported that 
the use of NSBBs increased or did not affect survival time in cir￾rhotic patients with refractory ascites.73,74 Another study found 
that treatment with low-dose propranolol (80 mg/day) increased 
survival time in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.75
The role of NSBBs in patients with refractory ascites or spontane￾ous bacterial peritonitis thus remains uncertain, and clinicians 
must carefully consider the risks and benefits when deciding 
whether to administer them. If NSBBs are administered, thorough 
monitoring of blood pressure and renal function is necessary, and 
dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered in pa￾tients who develop low blood pressure or impaired renal function. 
Discontinuation of NSBBs can increase the risk of EV bleeding; 
thus, if NSBBs are stopped, EVL should be considered.26
Carvedilol
Adjusting the dose of carvedilol is easier than adjusting the 
dose of NSBBs because it is not guided by heart rate. Carvedilol is 
started at 6.25 mg once a day (or 3.125 mg twice a day), and af￾ter 3 days increased to 6.25 mg twice a day. The maximum dose 

90 http://www.e-cmh.org

https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2019.0010n
is 12.5 mg daily. Systolic blood pressure should not be decreased 
<90 mmHg.47
EVL
The advantages of EVL are that it can be performed in the same 
session as screening endoscopy, and it has few contraindications. 
The disadvantages of EVL are the side effects associated with se￾dation and the risk of causing dysphagia, esophageal ulcerations, 
strictures, and bleeding. Although the incidence of side effects is 
higher with NSBBs, severe side effects, such as ulcer bleeding at 
the ligation site, are more likely to be associated with EVL.47 Some 
studies have reported that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) signifi￾cantly reduce the size of post-EVL ulcers or the rate of post-EVL 
ulcer bleeding.76-78 In cirrhotic patients, the long-term use of PPIs 
can increase the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and HE, 
so PPIs should be used with caution.79-81 Meanwhile, because EVL 
is a local therapy that does not act on the pathophysiology of 
portal hypertension, not only is it unable to prevent complications 
other than variceal bleeding, but it also requires follow-up endos￾copies to assess variceal recurrence, even after variceal eradica￾tion,47 defined as a case in which varices are not seen or become 
too small to be ligated. Repeat EVL can be performed at intervals 
of 2–8 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Follow-up en￾doscopies should be performed 1–6 months after variceal eradi￾cation and every 6–12 months thereafter.47,59,82
[Recommendations] 
1. In cirrhotic patients with small EVs that have a high risk of 
bleeding (decompensated cirrhosis or red color signs on 
endoscopy), the use of a NSBBs (propranolol or nadolol) 
should be considered to prevent first variceal bleeding. (B1) 
NSBBs are adjusted every 2–3 days until the resting heart rate 
reaches 55–60 beats per minute.
2. In cirrhotic patients with large EVs, the use of a NSBBs 
(propranolol or nadolol), carvedilol, or EVL is recommended 
to prevent first variceal bleeding. (A1) A combination of 
NSBBs and EVL can also be considered. (B2)
Diagnosis and management of acute esophageal 
variceal bleeding
Diagnosis of acute esophageal variceal bleeding
In patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, variceal bleed￾ing caused by portal hypertension can be suspected if the patients 
show jaundice, ascites, HE, splenomegaly, collateral circulation of 
the abdominal vessels, lower extremity edema, or spider angio￾mas. A definite diagnosis can be established by endoscopic exam￾ination. If blood clots or white nipples appear on the surface of 
the varices, or if blood is found in the stomach without a potential 
bleeding focus other than EVs, acute EV bleeding can be diag￾nosed.45
General management of acute esophageal variceal bleed￾ing
Acute EV bleeding is a medical emergency requiring intensive 
care. It is essential to protect the circulatory and respiratory status 
of the patient regardless of the cause of bleeding. Volume resus￾citation via adequate fluid therapy and a packed red blood cell 
(PRBC) transfusion should be initiated to restore and maintain he￾modynamic stability. A recent RCT showed that bleeding-related 
mortality (5% vs. 9%, P=0.02) and the incidence of serious ad￾verse events (12% vs. 18%, P=0.01) were significantly decreased 
in the “restrictive” PRBC transfusion group (initiating PRBC trans￾fusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL and maintaining it at 
7–9 g/dL) compared with the “liberal” PRBC transfusion group.83
Improved survival in the restrictive transfusion group might be as￾sociated with lower rates of hemostasis failure and serious ad￾verse events. In patients with acute EV bleeding, adequate fluid 
therapy/PRBC transfusion should be performed while considering 
age, cardiovascular disease, presence or absence of ongoing 
bleeding, and hemodynamic status. Excessive fluid therapy/PRBC 
transfusion may increase the portal pressure and aggravate bleed￾ing from the varices, so that should be taken into account.84 Re￾garding correction of coagulopathy, clinical studies of recombi￾nant factor VIIa have not shown a clear benefit, and therefore the 
routine use of fresh frozen plasma or recombinant factor VIIa is 
not recommended.85,86 Although the efficacy of platelet transfu￾sion in patients with acute EV bleeding has not been proven be￾cause of a lack of clinical studies, it can be considered in patients 
with severe thrombocytopenia.
Pharmacological treatment of acute esophageal variceal 
bleeding
Cirrhotic patients presenting with acute gastrointestinal bleed￾ing have a high risk of developing bacterial infections, therefore 
initiation of prophylactic antibiotic treatment at the time of admis￾sion is necessary. Meta-analyses of RCTs have shown that the use 
of antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of infections, recurrent 
bleeding, and bleeding-related death.87,88 A recent meta-analysis 

91
The Korean Association for the Study of the Liver (KASL)
Guideline for varices and hepatic encephalopathy
http://www.e-cmh.org https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2019.0010n
demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotic treatment was associat￾ed with a decrease in bleeding-related mortality (RR, 0.79; 95% 
CI, 0.63–0.98), mortality from bacterial infections (RR, 0.43; 95% 
CI, 0.19–0.97), development of bacterial infections (RR, 0.35; 
95% CI, 0.26–0.47), and rebleeding (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38–
0.74).88 However, another recent retrospective study questioned 
the usefulness of the routine antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic pa￾tients experiencing acute variceal bleeding because of a very low 
incidence of bacterial infections (2%) and mortality (0.4%) in 
Child-Pugh class A patients with acute variceal bleeding, even in 
the absence of prophylactic antibiotic treatment.89 No prospective 
study has evaluated the usefulness of antibiotic prophylaxis, and 
therefore the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is recom￾mended for all cirrhotic patients presenting with variceal bleeding, 
regardless of their Child-Pugh class. In a previous RCT comparing 
intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g every 24 hours) and oral norfloxacin 
(400 mg every 12 hours) for the prophylaxis of bacterial infection 
in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, the incidence 
of proven or possible infections (11% vs. 33%, P=0.003), proven 
infections (11% vs. 26%, P=0.03), and spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis or bacteremia (2% vs. 12%, P=0.03) was significantly 
lower in the ceftriaxone group.90 However, controversy remains 
about whether those results are applicable to general cirrhotic 
patients because that was study conducted in Spain among pa￾tients with advanced cirrhosis, and most of the Gram-negative 
bacilli detected in the patients receiving oral norfloxacin were 
norfloxacin-resistant strains. Therefore, it is necessary to select 
appropriate antibiotics based on local antimicrobial susceptibility 
patterns. Generally, short-term (maximum 7 days) antibiotic pro￾phylaxis with intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g every 24 hours) is rec￾ommended in patients with acute variceal bleeding.
Vasoactive agents, such as vasopressin, terlipressin, somatosta￾tin, and octreotide, are effective in supporting hemostasis in pa￾tients with acute variceal bleeding by decreasing portal pressure. 
In a meta-analysis, the use of vasoactive agents in patients with 
acute variceal bleeding was significantly associated with a reduc￾tion in 7-day mortality (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57–0.95) and an in￾crease in the hemostasis rate (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.13–1.30).91 In 
patients with suspected variceal bleeding, vasoactive agents 
should be initiated as soon as possible, together with prophylactic 
antibiotics, before the diagnostic endoscopy. Vasopressin reduces 
portal pressure by inducing systemic and splanchnic vasoconstric￾tion, but it is not now recommended for patients with acute vari￾ceal bleeding because of the significant side effects, such as an 
increase in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in cardiac 
output and coronary blood flow. Although terlipressin, a synthetic 
analogue of vasopressin, is the only drug proven to reduce bleed￾ing-related mortality (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49–0.88),92 its side ef￾fects, such as hyponatremia and myocardial ischemia due to coro￾nary artery vasoconstriction, should be considered.93,94 A recent 
meta-analysis91 and a Korean multicenter RCT11 comparing three 
vasoactive agents (terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide) 
found no significant differences among them regarding the hemo￾stasis rate and survival time. In patients with acute variceal bleed￾ing, it is recommended that one of the vasoactive agents should 
be started as soon as possible (Table 2) and continued for 3–5 
days.26,47
Endoscopic treatment of acute esophageal variceal bleed￾ing
If acute variceal bleeding is suspected, endoscopy should be 
performed as soon as possible to confirm the hemorrhagic focus 
and hemostasis. Endoscopic hemostasis should be done when 
acute EV hemorrhage is confirmed by endoscopy. EVL is the endo￾scopic treatment of choice for patients with acute bleeding from 
EVs. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) is no longer recom￾mended as standard treatment for acute EV bleeding because of 
its higher incidence of treatment failure, bleeding-related mortali￾ty, and adverse events compared with EVL.95-99 In a meta-analysis 
comparing EVL and EIS in patients with acute EV bleeding, bleed￾ing-related mortality did not differ significantly (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 
0.77–1.17), but the risk of rebleeding was reduced (RR, 0.68; 
95% CI, 0.57–0.81) and the rate of variceal eradication was in￾creased (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01–1.12) in patients undergoing EVL 
compared with EIS.100 Most practice guidelines recommend en￾doscopy within 12 hours after presentation with suspected varice￾Table 2. Vasoactive agents used in the management of acute variceal bleeding

al bleeding, but that recommendation lacks evidence. A previous 
Taiwanese retrospective study reported that delayed endoscopy 
(>15 hours after admission) was an independent risk factor of in￾hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.67; 95% CI, 1.27–10.39).101
In addition, a prospective observational study of 101 patients 
with acute EV bleeding showed that the 6-week rebleeding rate 
(18.9% vs. 38.9%, P=0.028) and mortality (27% vs. 52.8%, 
P=0.031) were significantly lowered in patients undergoing early 
endoscopy (≤12 hours) compared with those undergoing delayed 
endoscopy (>12 hours).102 However, because those studies were 
performed without randomization, several confounders that can 
delay the endoscopy, such as hemodynamic instability, might have 
influenced the results. Therefore, until the results of large RCTs 
are reported, endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible 
in patients with suspected acute EV bleeding. However, the spe￾cific timing should be determined by the hemodynamic status of 
individual patients and the experience and medical resources of 
the institution.
Once endoscopy and EVL have been performed, early place￾ment of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can 
be considered in carefully selected patients at high risk for re￾bleeding. Early TIPS placement reduced the rates of treatment 
failure and bleeding-related mortality in an RCT103 of patients with 
a HVPG >20 mmHg and in an RCT104 of patients with Child-Pugh 
class C cirrhosis (score of 10–13) or Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis 
with active bleeding on endoscopy despite intravenous adminis￾tration of a vasoactive agent. However, because these two trials 
excluded patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, Child-Pugh 
class B cirrhosis without active bleeding during endoscopy, Child￾Pugh class C with a score of 14–15, patients >75 years, HCC be￾yond the Milan criteria, or a creatinine level greater than 3 mg/dL, 
it should be considered that those study results apply to only a 
very small portion of patients with acute variceal bleeding. Nota￾bly, a recent prospective observational study showed that the 
1-year rebleeding risk was significantly decreased (3% vs. 49%, 
P<0.001), but 1-year survival did not differ between patients with 
and without a TIPS (66.8±9.4% vs. 74.2±7.8%, P=0.78).105 Fur￾ther studies are needed to evaluate the beneficial effect of early 
TIPS placement.
Recently, the efficacy of applying hemostatic powder via endos￾copy within 2 hours of admission was evaluated in 86 randomized 
patients with acute variceal bleeding.106 Cirrhotic patients with 
acute variceal bleeding received standard medical treatment and 
were randomized to receive either immediate endoscopy with he￾mostatic powder application within 2 hours of admission followed 
by early elective endoscopy the next day (that is, within 12–24 
hours of admission) for definitive treatment (EVL for EV bleeding 
or endoscopic variceal obturation [EVO] for gastric variceal bleed￾ing; study group) or early elective endoscopy only (control group). 
Improved rates of hemostasis and survival time in the study group 
suggested the therapeutic potential of endoscopic application of 
hemostatic powder, an easy procedure requiring minimal exper￾tise.
Rescue treatment for patients with hemostasis failure
Failure to control acute EV bleeding is defined as death or the 
need to change therapy (defined by one of the following criteria) 
within 5 days of an acute bleeding episode.107
- Fresh hematemesis of ≥100 mL of fresh blood ≥2 hours after 
the start of a specific pharmacological treatment or therapeu￾tic endoscopy
- Development of hypovolemic shock
- 3 g drop in hemoglobin (9% drop in hematocrit) within 24 
hours without transfusion
TIPS placement is considered the best rescue treatment for pa￾tients with inadequate bleeding control despite combined phar￾macological and endoscopic therapy.108 A prospective observa￾tional study to evaluate the efficacy of TIPS in 58 patients who 
failed to achieve hemostasis after EIS and pharmacological treat￾ment reported that the TIPS achieved control of the bleeding in 
52 patients (90%), and 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 
51.7% and 40.2%, respectively.108 Balloon tamponade is still used 
as a bridge therapy and provides hemostasis in 80–90% of pa￾tients, but the rebleeding rate after deflation is as high as approx￾imately 50%.109,110 Moreover, because it is associated with a high 
rate of serious complications, such as esophageal ulceration, 
esophageal rupture, and aspiration pneumonia, balloon tampon￾ade should not exceed 24 hours.111 In a small RCT, a self-expand￾able, esophageal covered metal stent was tested as an alternative 
to balloon tamponade in patients in whom pharmacological and 
endoscopic treatment failed to control bleeding.112 Although sur￾vival in the esophageal stent group was not improved compared 
with the balloon tamponade group, bleeding control was higher 
(85% vs. 47%, P=0.037), and serious adverse events were lower 
(15% vs. 47%, P=0.077) in the esophageal stent group.112 This 
stent can be placed endoscopically without radiological guidance, 
and it can stay in place for up to 2 weeks. However, because only 
28 patients were included in that study, further study is warrant￾ed.

Prevention of esophageal variceal rebleeding
Definition of esophageal variceal rebleeding
EV rebleeding is defined as recurrent bleeding after an absence 
of bleeding for at least 5 days following recovery from acute EV 
bleeding.107 An average of 60% of patients with acute EV bleed￾ing experience rebleeding within 1–2 years, and the mortality rate 
from rebleeding is 33%. Therefore, appropriate treatment to pre￾vent rebleeding is necessary.15,48
Diagnosis of esophageal variceal rebleeding
The diagnosis of EV rebleeding is the same as the diagnosis of 
acute EV bleeding. Clinically significant rebleeding can be sus￾pected in a patient who has recurrent melena or hematemesis 
with 1) hospitalization or the need for a transfusion, 2) a decrease 
in hemoglobin of more than 3 g /dL, or 3) death within 6 weeks.107
Prevention of esophageal variceal rebleeding
NSBBs and EVL are the most common methods used to prevent 
EV rebleeding. NSBBs, which reduce portal pressure, have been 
reported to be more effective than placebo at preventing rebleed￾ing in several RCTs.113-115 The combination of an NSBBs plus ISMN 
could improve portal pressure reduction,116 but it could also in￾crease the incidence of side effects such as headache and dizzi￾ness.117 EVL is the endoscopic treatment of choice for the preven￾tion of EV rebleeding. EVL should be repeated every 2–8 weeks 
until variceal eradication is achieved. Periodic endoscopic follow￾up is needed to detect the recurrence of varices even after 
achievement of variceal eradication. Several systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses comparing EVL alone to NSBBs alone demon￾strated no difference in the rebleeding rate,51,118,119 but the overall 
mortality rate during follow-up was significant higher with EVL 
alone (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.55)51 or not different.119 In a 
long-term follow-up study, the rebleeding rate was higher (30% 
vs. 64%, P=0.001) but the survival time was longer (30% vs. 
49%, P=0.013) in patients treated with the combination of an 
NSBBs plus ISMN.120
Several RCTs and meta-analyses comparing the combination of 
EVL plus NSBBs to EVL alone or NSBBs alone showed that the 
combination therapy had lower overall rebleeding and variceal re￾bleeding.121-124 Therefore, the combination of EVL plus an NSBBs 
has been suggested as the primary treatment for preventing EV 
rebleeding. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the re￾bleeding rate decreased (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28–0.69) and the 
mortality rate during follow-up tended to decrease with the com￾bination of EVL plus a NSBBs (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.33–1.03) com￾pared with EVL alone. However, although the overall rebleeding 
rate tended to decrease (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58–1.00), the mor￾tality rate during follow-up did not differ between the combina￾tion of EVL plus NSBBs and NSBBs alone.125 These results suggest 
the importance of NSBBs in preventing EV bleeding.
RCTs comparing carvedilol to EVL (36.4% vs. 35.5%, P=0.857) 
and carvedilol to the combination of nadolol plus ISMN (51% vs. 
43%, P=0.46) did not show any significant difference in rebleed￾ing rate, and the side effects of carvedilol were less than those 
with the combination of nadolol plus ISMN (1.6% vs. 28.3%, 
P<0.0001).126,127 Therefore, the use of carvedilol to prevent EV re￾bleeding can be considered, but no studies have compared the 
combination of EVL plus carvedilol with the combination of EVL 
plus an NSBBs, which is currently considered to be the primary 
treatment to prevent rebleeding. Further studies using carvedilol 
to prevent EV rebleeding are required.
In a meta-analysis of studies about preventing variceal rebleed￾ing by using NSBBs to reduce portal pressure, the risk of variceal 
rebleeding was significantly reduced (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09–
0.33; P=0.0001) when the HVPG was decreased to the target 
level (reduction in HVPG of ≥20% or to ≤12 mmHg) compared

with the non-responding group.128 A recent RCT comparing HVPG￾based medical therapy with TIPS placement to reduce variceal re￾bleeding showed lower incidence of rebleeding within 2 years 
(26% vs. 7%, P=0.002) in the TIPS group, but there was no sig￾nificant difference in mortality during follow-up between the two 
groups, and the incidence of HE was lower (8% vs. 18%, P=0.05) 
in the HVPG-based medical therapy group.129 Considering that a 
TIPS is a limited treatment method, HVPG-based medical therapy 
is a useful way to prevent rebleeding if HVPG measurement is 
possible. However, because HVPG measurement is invasive, it is 
not widely practiced in many hospitals.
An RCT comparing TIPS placement with a combination of EVL 
plus an NSBBs to prevent variceal rebleeding found a lower vari￾ceal rebleeding rate in the TIPS group (0% vs. 29%, P=0.001), 
but the incidence of HE within 1 year in that group was higher 
(35% vs. 14%, P=0.035). There was no difference in the follow￾up mortality rate (32% vs. 26%, P=0.418) between the two 
groups.130 Therefore, the use of TIPS is not recommended as a pri￾mary treatment for the prevention of variceal rebleeding, and it 
should instead be considered a rescue therapy for patients with 
primary treatment failure.131 In addition, liver transplantation is 
considered a rescue therapy for patients with recurrent variceal 
rebleeding because it exhibits good long-term results.132,133
[Recommendations] 
1. In patients with acute esophageal variceal bleeding, 
treatment to prevent variceal rebleeding is recommended. (A1)
2. The combination of endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) 
plus NSBBs is recommended as the primary treatment 
for esophageal variceal bleeding. (A1) If the combination 
treatment is difficult to perform, use of a NSBBs or EVL alone 
is recommended. (A1)
3. If primary treatment for esophageal variceal rebleeding fails, 
TIPS placement should be considered as a rescue therapy. (B1)
4. Liver transplantation might be considered in patients with 
recurrent variceal rebleeding. (B1)

Gastric varices are enlarged submucosal veins of the stomach that 
cause critical upper gastrointestinal bleeding. GVs occur in approxi￾mately 20% of patients with portal hypertension, and the bleeding 
rate in 2 years is known to be 25%.134 The incidence of gastric vari￾ces is lower than that of EVs, but their rebleeding rate and mortality 
rate are higher because they cause severe bleeding.134-136

Gastric varices are classified as gastroesophageal varices (GOV) 
or isolated gastric varices (IGV) depending on their location and 
relation to any EVs (Fig. 1). GOVs are classified by whether they 
extend along the lesser curvature (GOV1) or the gastric fundus 
(GOV2). IGV are classified as varices located in the fundus (IGV1) 
and those in any other region, i.e., stomach or duodenum 
(IGV2).134 The incidence of GOV1s is about 74%.
Prevention of primary bleeding of gastric varices
The risk factors for gastric variceal bleeding are location 
(IGV1>GOV2>GOV1), variceal size, redness, and severe liver dys￾function.26,47,93,137-139
To prevent bleeding from GOV1s, follow the guidelines for the 
prevention of EV bleeding. In a Korean study of 85 patients with 
GOV1s, the GOV1s also disappeared when EVs were eliminated 
by EVL (64.7%).140 For GOV2s and IGV1s, EVO, balloon-occluded 
retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO), and vascular plug-as￾sisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (PARTO) can be consid￾ered to prevent bleeding.141,142 NSBBs are non-invasive and can be 
used because they can reduce other side effects in patients with 
cirrhosis.
One randomized study reported the prevention of first gastric 
variceal bleeding. It enrolled 89 patients with GOV2s or IGV1s 
larger than 10 mm.141 The effects of EVO (cyanoacrylate), an 
NSBB, and simple observation were compared. For the prevention 
of gastric variceal bleeding, EVO (10%) was superior to an NSBB 
(38%) and simple observation (53%).141 The survival rate of the 
EVO group (93%) was higher than that of the simple observation 
group (73%), but it did not differ from that of the NSBB group 
(83%). In a meta-analysis of patients with a high risk of gastric 
variceal bleeding, BRTO was effective in preventing gastric varice￾al bleeding (clinical success rate, 97.3%).142 In a recent study of 73 
patients, PARTO was found to be a safe procedure without seri￾ous side effects that effectively prevented gastric variceal bleed￾ing (Fig. 2).143,144
[Recommendations] 
1. Primary prevention of bleeding for GOV1s follows the 
recommendations for EVs. (B1)
2. The group at high risk for bleeding (redness or severe liver 
dysfunction) from GOV2s or IGV1s can be treated with BRTO, 
PARTO, or EVO. (B2)
Management of bleeding from gastric varices
Bleeding from gastric varices is less common than from EVs; 
however, the risks of rebleeding or varix-related death are much

higher in patients bleeding from gastric varices. The gastric vari￾ces that bleed are generally large and have high blood flow in the 
channel, which makes massive bleeding common in patients with 
large gastric varices.134,145,146 Gastric varices exhibit unique charac￾teristics and have a greater variety of sizes, forms, locations, and 
collateral vessels than EVs. An individualized approach might be 
needed because few well-controlled clinical trials have tested 
treatments for gastric variceal bleeding. Until sufficient evidence 
accumulates, clinicians should seek the best option for each pa￾tient based on the patient’s general condition and bleeding pat￾terns and the clinician’s medical resources and expertise.145
Management of bleeding from gastric varices
Endoscopic therapy
Urgent endoscopic examination, within 12 to 24 hours, is nec￾essary when a patient is suspected to have active bleeding from 
gastric varices. Endoscopic examination can visualize the bleeding 
sites and directly enable proper hemostatic treatments.47,147
EVO
EVO achieves hemostasis and induces variceal eradication by an 
intravariceal injection of tissue adhesive agents (cyanoacrylates). 
Active or recent bleeding from fundic varices (GOV2s, IGV1s) or 
GOV1s can be managed with EVO. Special care is needed to pre￾vent complications from the adhesive agents, such as ocular inju￾ry, damage to endoscopic devices, or the impaction of an injection 
needle into a varix.148 Medical personnel are advised to wear gog￾gles during the procedure. The working channel of a scope can be 
occluded by adhesive agent that spills during the procedure, so it 
can be helpful to flush the channel with olive oil in advance. To 
inject the sticky mixture quickly, a large needle is generally used 
(21 G or 22 G). The injection site is determined based on the di￾rection of blood flow inside the varix. Because the intravariceal 
pressure is usually concentrated in the most protruding part of the 
varix, avoid that site if possible. The injection needle should be 
long enough to pass through the thick gastric wall (5 mm or lon￾ger). 2-N-butyl cyanoacrylate, which is the most commonly used 
agent in Korea, is used as a 1:1 mixture with lipiodol to delay the 
polymerization reaction. About 1 mL of mixture is used in each 
session, and the injection can be repeated until hemostasis is 
achieved. The initial volume and ratio of the mixture can be ad￾justed to accommodate the variceal size, intravariceal blood flow, 
and bleeding pattern (active or stabilized). If the bleeding is se￾vere or the variceal size is large, the volume of the mixture can be 
increased to 2 mL at a time. As soon as the injection is finished, 1 
mL of distilled water or saline should be pushed into the catheter 
to ensure that the mixture remaining in the catheter is injected 
into the varix. Then, the needle should be retracted quickly to 
prevent intravariceal impaction of the needle. The success rate of 
EVO for hemostasis was 91–97%, and the rebleeding rate was 
17–49% in patients with active gastric variceal bleeding.149-153 The 
common complications following EVO are systemic embolism, in￾fection, fever, gastric perforation, gastric ulcer, and peritonitis.154
EVL
As with EVs, EVL is frequently performed for GOV1 bleeding. 
EVL for gastric varices showed an initial hemostasis rate of 
80–90% and a rebleeding rate of 14–56% in patients with 
GOV1s.140,155-158 However, it should be noted that the depth and 
size of gastric varices differ from those of EVs. Ligation might not 
be adequate due to the thick gastric mucosa. Gastric ulcers, 
where the bands fall off, will expose submucosal varices directly 
to gastric acid and food materials. This situation could increase 
the risk of massive bleeding from the ulcers.154,155,158,159 In patients 
with fundal variceal bleeding, the effect or safety of EVL has not 
been fully explored. In a small randomized trial, EVL showed a 
significantly higher rebleeding rate than EVO in patients with 
IGV1 bleeding (83.3% vs. 7.7%, P=0.003).155
Radiologic intervention
Radiologic intervention is one useful hemostatic therapy for the 
management of bleeding from gastric varices. Sufficient consulta￾tion with interventional radiologists is needed in advance. Imag￾ing tests, such as computed tomography (CT), should be per￾formed before the procedure to confirm that the collateral veins 
are accessible and that no contraindications to the procedure are 
present.
TIPS
TIPS placement is a procedure that robustly decompresses por￾tal hypertension by making a bypass between the hepatic vein 
and the portal vein. In small non-randomized trials, both TIPS and 
EVO achieved a hemostasis rate of more than 90%. Complica￾tions, such as HE and stent occlusion, and medical costs were 
higher with the TIPS than with EVO.160,161 However, TIPS place￾ment is a useful rescue therapy when initial hemostasis fails.162-164
The success rate of TIPS in controlling bleeding as a rescue thera￾py is 90–100%, with a rebleeding rate of 16–40%.162-166 More￾over, since non-covered stents have been replaced by covered

stents, the occlusion and stenosis rates have decreased to 
8%.167,168 HE can be prevented by decreasing the stent diameter. 
In a randomized study, the incidence rates of HE within 2 years 
were 43% and 27% in patients with a conventional stent (10 mm) 
and those with a smaller one (8 mm), respectively (P=0.03).168
TIPS is contraindicated in patients with heart failure or severe pul￾monary hypertension because it can abruptly increase preload to 
the heart. It is difficult to perform the procedure in patients with 
main portal vein thrombosis. When a cyst, abscess, or mass is 
blocking the accessible tract in the liver or the intrahepatic bile 
ducts are markedly dilated, it is difficult to perform TIPS.169
RTO
RTO obliterates gastric varices by infusing a sclerosant or em￾bolic agent in a retrograde manner through a gastrorenal shunt. 
An accessible shunt should be confirmed by CT prior to the proce￾dure. After occluding the shunt with a balloon catheter, a scle￾rosant, such as ethanolamine oleate or sodium tetradecyl sulfate, 
is infused into the gastric varices.170,171 In a recent, large, retro￾spective study, the technical success rate of BRTO was 95%.172
Another multicenter study, in which 23% of patients had GOV1s, 
had a technical success rate of 97%.173 However, the EVs recurred 
or became aggravated in 20–41% of patients after the proce￾dure.172,173 A recent meta-analysis also showed favorable results. 
The technical success and major complication rates of BRTO were 
96.4% and 2.6%, respectively. The clinical success rate, defined 
as no recurrence of gastric varices or complete obliteration of vari￾ces on subsequent imaging, was 97.3%.142
If a shunt is too large for balloon catheter occlusion, BRTO is 
not possible. Moreover, BRTO requires that patients retain the 
balloon catheter for several hours, until the sclerosing agent has 
hardened in the varices. In rare cases, the balloon can rupture 
during the procedure, and a systemic embolism of the sclerosing 
agent can occur. Therefore, a novel intervention, PARTO, was re￾cently developed. PARTO uses a vascular plug with or without 
coils instead of a balloon and uses a gelatin sponge as the embol￾ic agent.143 A multicenter prospective study showed that complete 
thrombosis of gastric varices and shunts was achieved in 98.6% 
of patients. No recurrent variceal bleeding or development of HE 
occurred during follow-up. Moreover, 40% of patients showed 
improvement in their Child-Pugh scores.144 Thus, PARTO is a note￾worthy treatment that can replace BRTO in patients with gastric 
varices and a gastrorenal shunt. However, more data on the long￾term efficacy and safety of PARTO are needed.
Treatment of gastric variceal bleeding
General management of gastric variceal bleeding 
In patients with cirrhosis and acute upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding, a restrictive blood transfusion strategy (with a target 
range for the post-transfusion hemoglobin level of 7 to 9 g/dL) 
and antibiotic prophylaxis improved survival.83,174 Although pa￾tients enrolled in the studies were small, the same transfusion 
strategy can be recommended for those with gastric variceal 
bleeding. The beneficial effects of vasoactive agents (terlipressin, 
octreotide, somatostatin) have not been fully proved in patients 
with gastric variceal bleeding, either. However, considering their 
ability to decrease portal hypertension, their use in patients with 
bleeding from gastric varices can be recommended.91,158,175,176
Treatment of GOV1 bleeding
GOV1s, which are an extended type of EV, develop along the 
lesser curvature and receive blood from the left gastric vein. 
When EVs are eradicated by endoscopic treatments, the gastric 
varices also concomitantly disappear in 60–65% of patients.134,140
Because of their close relationship in pathophysiology, the man￾agement of bleeding from cardiac varices (GOV1s) is similar to 
that for EV bleeding.177 However, it should be noted that sufficient 
ligation can be difficult for gastric varices because of their large 
size and deeper location. Furthermore, subsequent post-ligation 
ulcers might be exposed to gastric acid or food material.154,155,158,159
According to small clinical trials and observational studies, EVO 
produces more favorable outcomes than EVL. The initial hemosta￾sis rates with EVO and EVL in patients with GOV1 bleeding were 
85–100% and 80–90%, respectively. The rebleeding rates fol￾lowing EVO and EVL were 3–26% and 14–56%, respective￾ly.140,155-158 However, most of those trials were small; the evidence 
needed to recommend one of these treatments over the other re￾mains insufficient.140,155,157,158,178 Therefore, clinicians may choose 
either EVO or EVL based on their expertise, available medical re￾sources, and the variceal condition (size or extent).
Treatment of GOV2 or IGV1 bleeding
GOV2s are a type of gastric varix that extends from EVs toward 
the fundus. IGV1s are varices localized in the fundus in the ab￾sence of EVs.134 Both GOV2s and IGV1s are usually called gastric 
fundic varices. Unlike EVs, fundic varices are supplied with blood 
from the posterior gastric vein or short gastric vein.179,180 Bleeding 
from the fundus usually occurs in a stage of large varix. Manage￾ment of fundic variceal bleeding can be difficult because massive

or recurrent bleeding is frequently accompanied. Moreover, collat￾eral shunts or blood circulation around the fundic varices are very 
diverse. Therefore, it is difficult to apply simple or uniform treat￾ments for fundic variceal bleeding.181 Urgent endoscopic examina￾tion is always needed in patients with suspicious fundic variceal 
bleeding in order to direct visualization of bleeding sites and to 
apply immediate treatments. EVO is one of the most commonly 
performed in patients with bleeding from fundic varices182 EVO 
achieved initial hemostasis more often than EVL (OR, 4.44; 95% 
CI, 1.14–17.3). In particular, the rebleeding rate following EVO 
was significantly lower than that following EVL in patients with 
IGV1s (OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01–0.58).183 TIPS placement and EVO 
are both effective treatments to control bleeding, with a hemo￾stasis rate of more than 90%. Because of complications such as 
HE, stent occlusion, and higher cost, TIPS placement over EVO is 
not recommended as a first-line treatment.160,161 However, TIPS 
placement is an effective rescue therapy when endoscopic therapy 
fails. The hemostasis rate of TIPS in a rescue setting is 90–
100%.162-166 BRTO also achieved a high hemostasis rate (more 
than 90%).184-186 However, BRTO showed a significantly lower re￾bleeding risk (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09–0.81) and a lower risk of 
HE (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02–0.13) than TIPS.186 Improvement in 
liver function was also demonstrated following BRTO.187 However, 
all those results are based on mostly small retrospective studies.
In a small prospective study, BRTO and EVO had similar hemo￾stasis and technical success rates. However, the rebleeding rate 
was significantly lower in the BRTO group than the EVO group 
(15.4% vs. 71.4%, P<0.01).188 These results should be interpreted 
carefully, however, because BRTO was performed only in patients 
without active bleeding; all the patients with active bleeding were 
treated with EVO.
In summary, current data suggest that EVO, TIPS, BRTO, or 
(theoretically) PARTO can be used as the initial treatment for pa￾tients bleeding from fundic varices. Because of a lack of evidence, 
treatments should be chosen based on individual situations in 
consideration of patients’ safety and the applicability of each 
therapy in the relevant medical facility.
Use of PPIs
Currently, PPIs are used in many patients to prevent ulcer bleed￾ing following endoscopic treatments. However, their effectiveness 
and duration of treatment have not been fully explored. Long￾term use of PPI can increase risk of infection and subsequently 
cause spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and HE.79 However, a re￾cent retrospective study showed that PPI use decreased the re￾bleeding risk following EVO (OR, 0.554; 95% CI, 0.352–0.873).189
Rescue therapy in case of endoscopic failure
A TIPS can be urgently placed when endoscopic treatments fail. 
The hemostasis rate with rescue TIPS was 90–96% in patients 
with gastric varices, which is comparable to that with EV bleed￾ing.162,163 In a few small studies, BRTO also showed comparable 
outcomes in patients who failed to achieve initial hemostasis. 
BRTO can be considered as a rescue therapy when a patient was 
hemodynamically stabilized and has an accompanying gastrorenal 
shunt.184,186 As a bridging therapy, a balloon tamponade can be 
applied to control massive bleeding until rescue therapy is ready.109
[Recommendations] 
1. In patients with gastric variceal bleeding, general management, 
such as prophylactic antibiotics, restrictive transfusion, and 
vasoactive agents, can be provided as they are for esophageal 
variceal bleeding. (B1)
2. Gastric varices extending from EVs along the lesser curvature 
(GOV1s) can be treated with either EVO or EVL, depending on 
the size and location of the bleeding varix. (B1)
3. In patients with bleeding from fundic varices (GOV2s, IGV1s), 
EVO should be considered first. (A1) Retrograde transvenous 
obliteration (BRTO or PARTO) or TIPS can be used depending 
 on the bleeding status (active or stabilized) and the presence 
of an accessible shunt. (B1)
4. A PPI can be used following endoscopic treatments to prevent 
post-procedure ulcer bleeding. (B2)
5. Retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO or PARTO) or TIPS 
should be considered as a rescue therapy when endoscopic 
treatments fail. (B1)
6. Until a rescue therapy is ready, a balloon tamponade can be 
applied as a bridging therapy. (B2)
Prevention of rebleeding
GOV1s can be managed in the same way as EVs to prevent re￾bleeding. The eradication of concurrent EVs with EVL and an 
NSBB can be used if the EVs are medium to large in diameter. 
Gastric varices subsequently disappeared in 65% of patients when 
EVs were controlled.140 The rebleeding rate from GOV1s following 
eradication of EVs was 16–42%.155,156 Esophageal EVL can be per￾formed simultaneously with or after treatments for gastric varices. 
In terms of gastric varices, EVO showed a significantly lower re-

bleeding rate than EVL in patients bleeding from GOV1s (OR, 0.39; 
95% CI, 0.16–0.94).155,158,183 However, those studies included only 
a small number of patients. In a retrospective Korean study, EVO 
showed beneficial outcomes, with lower 1-year rebleeding rate 
(3.6% vs. 30.8%, P=0.004) and bleeding-related mortality rate 
(5% vs. 22%, P=0.05) than EVL.140 In a different small study, TIPS 
placement showed a significantly lower rebleeding rate than EVO 
(21% vs. 65%, P<0.02).190 However, it is difficult to draw conclu￾sions from that study alone because its rebleeding rate following 
EVO was relatively higher than previous reports. If an accessible 
gastrorenal shunt is identified, BRTO or PARTO might be consid￾ered. Unfortunately, evidence to support those interventions in 
patients with GOV1 bleeding is very limited.173,191
In patients bleeding from fundic varices (GOV2s or IGV1s), the 
only predictor for rebleeding following EVO was variceal size (F3). 
The use of NSBBs failed to decrease the rebleeding rate.192 In an 
RCT, eradication of gastric varices with repeated EVO lowered the 
rebleeding rate significantly compared with NSBBs (10% vs. 44%, 
P=0.004).193 There were no differences in rebleeding (54% vs. 
47%, P=0.609) or bleeding-related mortality (42% vs. 47%, 
P=0.766) between EVO alone and EVO plus an NSBB, respective￾ly.194 Therefore, use of an NSBB is not recommended to prevent 
recurrent bleeding from fundic varices. However, NSBBs should be 
considered if patients have significant portal hypertension or oth￾er proven indications, such as large EVs.47 Clinical trials comparing 
the rebleeding rates after repeated EVO and TIPS or BRTO are

scarce. In a small randomized study of patients with GOV2 bleed￾ing, there was no significant difference in the rebleeding rate be￾tween EVO repeated every 4 weeks and TIPS placement (16% vs. 
0%, P>0.05).190 However, TIPS placement was associated with a 
higher incidence of complications than EVO.161 In a meta-analysis, 
BRTO (7.4%) showed a much lower rebleeding rate than TIPS 
(22.8%) (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09–0.81).186 For GOV2s, treatment 
of the accompanying EVs can be performed with or after the 
treatment of fundic varices, according to the guidelines for treat￾ing EVs (Fig. 3).
[Recommendations] 
1. In patients with remnant or recurrent GOV1s following 
initial treatments, repeated EVO or EVL can be performed to 
prevent rebleeding. (B2) 
2. In patients with remnant or recurrent fundic varices (GOV2s, 
IGV1s), EVO or RTO (BRTO or PARTO) can be performed. 
(B2) If there is no accessible shunt or if complications related 
to severe portal hypertension (recurrent bleeding from EVs, 
refractory ascites, or hydrothorax) are not controlled, a TIPS 
can be placed. (B2)
Other variceal bleeding
In cirrhosis, variceal bleeding at sites other than the stomach 
and esophagus is very rare, and there are no established treat￾ment guidelines. The most common locations are the rectum, du￾odenum, and postoperative stomach. A multi-disciplinary ap￾proach involving an endoscopist, interventional radiologists, and 
surgeons should be used to account for the vascular supply. EVO, 
BRTO, PARTO, TIPS, the coil inserting method, and the like can all 
be used.195
Portal hypertensive gastropathy
Definition and diagnosis
Although the incidence of portal hypertensive gastropathy 
bleeding in cirrhosis is not high, some patients experience poor 
quality of life due to chronic bleeding and the associated iron-de￾ficiency anemia and repeated transfusions.196,197 Portal hyperten￾sive gastropathy is diagnosed when gastric mucosal changes 
cause a snake-skin appearance or mosaic pattern on endoscopy 
in patients with portal hypertension.198-200 When gastric mucosal 
changes alone are found, it is diagnosed as a mild form. When 
red or dark brown viscous changes are found along with changes 
in the gastric mucosa, it is considered to be severe (Fig. 4).30 Se￾vere portal hypertensive gastropathy causes more chronic bleed￾ing than the mild form.201
Portal hypertensive gastropathy is associated with portal hyper￾tension and causes gastric mucosal changes in the stomach and 
body, and 30% of patients with gastric antral vascular ectasia 
Mild Severe

(watermelon stomach) also have portal hypertension. It is unclear 
whether portal hypertension is involved in the development of 
gastric antral vascular ectasia. Gastric antral vascular ectasia 
causes dilated vessels with fibrin thrombi and fibromuscular hy￾perplasia of the lamina propria.202
Treatment of portal hypertensive gastropathy
In chronic bleeding caused by portal hypertensive gastropathy, 
the goal of treatment is lowering the portal pressure with NSBBs, 
vasoconstrictors, or a TIPS.203,204 In cases with active bleeding, 
endoscopic treatment with argon plasma coagulation can be 
used. In addition, iron supplementation is recommended.205
[Recommendations] 
1. If chronic bleeding is caused by portal hypertensive gastropathy, 
nonselective beta-blockers can be used. (B1) 
HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
HE occurs in more than 10% of all cases of cirrhosis and is a 
critical complication that seriously reduces the quality of life.206
Because HE can cause serious losses not just for individuals, but 
also socioeconomically, preventive therapy is of paramount impor￾tance. However, because the pathophysiological factors in the de￾velopment of HE and biomarkers to predict the occurrence of HE 
have not been sufficiently identified, there are no standardized 
criteria for diagnosing, classifying, or evaluating the treatment re￾sponse to HE. It is imperative that those criteria be established in 
Korea. In particular, quality-of-life assessments and diet and exer￾cise education for patients with HE are clinically important and 
need to be actively developed.
Definition of HE
HE is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by hepatic dysfunc￾tion that manifests as various neurologic and psychiatric abnor￾malities.207-209 Clinically, it is classified into overt and covert en￾cephalopathy. Overt HE (OHE) is defined as the occurrence of 
disorientation, flapping tremor, or asterixis (Table 3). Covert HE 
(CHE) includes minimal encephalopathy in which cognitive impair￾ment cannot be identified without a cognitive function test and 
West-Haven criteria grade 1 HE, which means mild cognitive or 
behavioral change without disorientation.210 The prevalence of HE 
is reported to be 10–14% of cirrhotic patients and 16–21% of pa￾tients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.206,211 In Korea, HE was 
found in 16–21% of hepatitis B virus–related decompensated liver 
cirrhosis patients.212 Moreover, 20% of cirrhotic patients admitted 
to the emergency department were reported to have HE.213
HE is classified according to the underlying liver disease, clinical 
course, precipitating factors, and severity of neurologic symp￾toms.209 By underlying liver disease, HE is subdivided into three 
groups: from acute liver failure, from portosystemic bypass or 
shunting, and from portal hypertension caused by chronic liver 
disease. HE caused by portal hypertension is classified as episodic, 
recurrent (more than two times per year), and persistent HE (no 
fully recovery from behavioral change). When classified by the 
precipitating factors, HE is divided into precipitated and sponta￾neous types. Precipitating factors include gastrointestinal bleed￾Table 3. Definition and classification of hepatic encephalopathy

ing, uremia, sedatives, diuretics, protein overload, infection, con￾stipation, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. The severity of 
HE is classified using the West-Haven criteria (Table 3). 
Diagnosis of HE
Clinical symptoms
HE presents with a wide range of clinical patterns, from minimal 
HE (MHE), in which cognitive impairment cannot be identified 
without a cognitive function test, to OHE, which is easily detected 
based solely on symptoms and does not require a cognitive func￾tion test. As HE progresses, symptoms such as personality chang￾es, indifference, anxiety, and irritability appear and can reduce 
sleep quality and quality of life.214 In some patients, increased 
muscle tension, hyperreactivity, and the Babinski reflex are pres￾ent, and they are rarely accompanied by seizures.215,216 The flap￾ping tremor, a phenomenon in which hand tremors are caused by 
incongruity in the tension of various muscles resulting from hyper￾extension of the wrist as the fingers are spread apart, is a com￾mon symptom in the early and middle phases of OHE.
Severity classification 
The severity of HE is classified using the West-Haven criteria 
and the Glasgow Coma Scale,207 with the former used as the basic 
diagnostic criteria. However, due to their large number of subjec￾tive factors, the West-Haven criteria suffer from significant in￾terobserver deviation, which makes it difficult to diagnose the 
first stage (grade 1) of HE in a clinical setting. Therefore, MHE and 
stage 1 HE are classified as CHE (Table 3).217 The International So￾ciety for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISH￾EN) defines the onset of disorientation or flapping tremor as the 
start of OHE.218
Differential diagnosis 
HE requires differentiation from underlying brain diseases, such 
as cerebral hemorrhage and edema, that can accompany cogni￾tive dysfunction. It should also be differentiated from substance 
abuse, alcoholism, hyponatremia, and psychiatric illnesses. In 
chronic alcoholics in particular, it can be difficult to differentiate 
HE from other alcohol-related neurological diseases. For example, 
Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by a thiamine deficiency in￾duced by long-term drinking, is characterized by symptoms such 
as anterograde amnesia and decreased word memory,219 and 
Wernicke’s encephalopathy is marked by eye movement paralysis, 
gaze-induced nystagmus, and gait disturbances, in addition to 
memory lapses.220 Delirium caused by withdrawal from alcohol 
also needs to be differentiated from HE. Delirium that results from 
alcohol withdrawal is characterized by an increased heart rate, 
cold sweats, loud shouting, and a harsh and repetitive tremor.221
A differential diagnosis is required for acute hyponatremia, hypo￾glycemia, and metabolic alkalosis because each can present with 
symptoms similar to those of HE.222 The differential diagnosis for 
hyponatremia requires particular caution because its symptoms 
are very similar to those of HE, and hyponatremia itself can lead 
to HE.223 Subdural hematoma can also present with symptoms 
similar to those of HE and should be carefully differentiated. Cases 
of subdural hematoma are commonly accompanied by other neu￾rological symptoms, such as hemiplegia. Encephalitis often pres￾ents with symptoms such as headache, fever, vomiting, and stiff 
neck, but a differential diagnosis is required because those symp￾toms are not always clear and can be accompanied by sleepiness, 
drowsiness, and unconsciousness. In cases of dementia, the 
symptoms appear relatively gradually in most cases, whereas al￾cohol-related dementia often includes violent tendencies caused 
by frontal lobe damage, as well as the inability to remember re￾cent events.224
Diagnostic tests 
OHE can be diagnosed based solely on clinical symptoms, but 
other diseases that can cause cognitive dysfunction should still be 
ruled out. Brain CT and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
are helpful for differentiating neuropsychological abnormalities 
caused by underlying brain diseases, such as intracranial hemor￾rhage.225 Because the risk of cerebral hemorrhage is about five 
times higher in patients with liver cirrhosis than in healthy people, 
brain CT or MRI should be performed if a brain lesion is suspect￾ed.226 Brain MRI, in particular, is helpful for diagnosing HE, in 
which brain edema is associated with nonspecific symptoms such 
as headache and vomiting, when acute liver failure is suspect￾ed.225 On T1-weighted MRI, an increased signal in the basal gan￾glia is commonly observed, but those changes lack the sensitivity 
and specificity required to diagnose HE.227
If the diagnosis of HE is difficult, neurophysiological or neuro￾psychological tests can also be performed. In HE, a characteristic, 
slow triphasic wave is observed during electroencephalography 
(EEG).228 This slow triphasic wave is an overall periodic waveform 
in the bilateral frontal lobes that demonstrates bilateral synchroni￾zation and is often accompanied by slow background activity; it is 
usually seen in phase 2 or 3 HE and disappears in comatose pa￾tients.225,229 Once a slow triphasic wave has developed, the clinical

outcome is reportedly very poor.230 In recent studies, the decrease 
in EEG amplitude in patients with OHE was associated with the 
severity of HE.231
The brainstem auditory-evoked-potential test is sensitive for the 
diagnosis of CHE.226,227,232 Patients with liver cirrhosis accompa￾nied by CHE exhibit conduction time delays (I–V latency) from the 
auditory nerve to the midbrain and conduction time delays (III–V 
latency) from the pontine to the midbrain on the brain auditory￾evoked-potential test. It is also known that the risk of developing 
OHE is increased when abnormal findings are observed on the 
brain auditory-evoked-potentials test.227 However, in a study us￾ing the cortical auditory-evoked-potential test, the N200 latency 
was increased in patients with HE.233 Therefore, the diagnosis of 
HE cannot be made using EEG alone; further research is required 
to determine the usefulness of evoked-potential EEG in the diag￾nosis and prognosis of HE.
Serum ammonia 
The venous blood ammonia level is not proportional to the de￾gree of HE and has no association with its prognosis.234 The me￾tabolism of ammonia is greatly influenced by various organs, such 
as the kidneys, muscles, brain, and bowel, as well as the liver.235
However, repeated measurements of ammonia concentrations can 
help to determine a treatment’s effects.235,236 If patients with sus￾pected OHE have normal ammonia concentrations, attention 
should be paid to the differential diagnosis to look for other dis￾eases.234 There are various methods of measuring ammonia con￾centrations, such as those involving the venous or arterial blood 
or plasma. Because the normal range varies depending on the 
specific measurement method, a suitable reference value should 
be used. Although the partial pressure of ammonia gas in arterial 
blood is thought to be closely related to both the neurophysiologi￾cal test results and the ammonia concentration in the blood-brain 
barrier in patients with HE, additional studies are needed to de￾termine the clinical usefulness of that value.237 Regarding other 
serum markers, some studies have reported increases in the se￾rum S100β concentration that were proportional to the cognitive 
function test results in HE patients.238
[Recommendations] 
1. To confirm the diagnosis of OHE, other diseases that can 
cause cognitive impairment must first be ruled out, and the 
diagnosis must be made based on clinical symptoms. (A1)
2. HE is classified as either OHE, which can be diagnosed using 
only symptoms, or CHE, which requires a cognitive function 
test. (B1)
3. In patients with suspected HE, imaging tests, including a 
brain MRI or a neurophysiological test, can be performed to 
rule out other diseases that can cause cognitive impairment. 
(B2)
4. Venous blood ammonia levels are not proportional to the 
degree of HE and are not associated with its prognosis. 
(A1) However, if patients with suspected HE show normal 
ammonia concentrations, differentiation from other diseases 
is required. (B1)
Management of overt HE
The goals of treatment
The goals of treatment are as follows: 1) prevention of second￾ary damage caused by decreased consciousness and normaliza￾tion of the patient’s state of consciousness, 2) elimination of so￾cial and economic restrictions by preventing recurrence, and 
3) improvement of patient prognosis and quality of life. Therefore, 
appropriate supportive care should be provided to prevent sec￾ondary damage (e.g., fall-related injuries or aspiration pneumonia) 
from an altered consciousness. Furthermore, the precipitating fac￾tors should be identified and managed appropriately as soon as 
possible, and treatments should be initiated using medications 
that can decrease or eliminate the production of ammonia, the 
major pathogenic material.
Identification of precipitating factors and management 
The precipitating factor can be identified in 80–90% of patients 
with HE.239 In many cases, HE can be improved simply by eliminat￾ing the precipitating factor; therefore, identifying and promptly 
managing the precipitating factors is required.240 The currently 
known precipitating factors of HE and the corresponding diagnos￾tic tests and treatments are shown in Table 4. According to re￾ports from patients in the Republic of Korea,241,242 gastrointestinal 
bleeding, infection, dehydration by paracentesis, and constipation 
were the major precipitating factors.
Management of overt HE
Non-absorbable disaccharides
The primary treatment for HE is nonabsorbable disaccharides 

104 http://www.e-cmh.org
Clin Mol Hepatol
Volume_26 Number_2 April 2020
https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2019.0010n
such as lactulose (β-galactosido-fructose) or lactitol (β-galacto￾side sorbitol), which lead to recovery in 70–90% of HE patients.217
Therapeutic mechanisms involve the reduction of intestinal pH by 
the production of acetic and lactic acids (via bacterial degradation 
of lactulose). Another potential mechanism is the ability of the 
nonabsorbable disaccharides to increase the count of lactobacil￾lus, which do not produce ammonia. Furthermore, nonabsorbable 
disaccharides convert ammonia to ammonium, rendering it less 
absorbable, and they also produce an osmotic laxative effect that 
flushes the ammonia out.93,217 Based on many clinical studies and 
their low cost, nonabsorbable disaccharides are recommended as 
an initial therapeutic opition.209,240 Uribe et al.243 found that a 20% 
lactitol enema had higher efficacy in improving symptoms than a 
tap water enema (100% vs. 20%, P=0.0037) and that the overall 
response rate to nonabsorbable disaccharides–based therapy was 
82.5%. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis,244
lactulose or lactitol was more effective in improving symptoms 
than placebo, with a RR of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.46–0.84), This find￾ing was reproduced in another recent study,245 which found an RR 
of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.53–0.74). When overt HE occurs, 30–45 mL 
of lactulose (20–30 g) every 1–2 hours should be administered 
orally until the patient is having at least 2 bowel movements a 
day. An equivalent daily dose of lactitol is 67–100 g.246 Thereafter, 
the dose should be titrated to achieve two to three soft stools per 
day. If patients are unable to take medications orally, administra￾tion via nasogastric tube might be tried. If patients have severe 
HE (West-Haven criteria of grade 3 or more) or are unable to take 
medications orally or via nasogastric tube, an enema of 300 mL 
lactulose and 700 mL water can be performed 3–4 times per day 
until clinical improvement is noted.240,243,247,248 In this situation, the 
enema solution should be retained in the intestine for at least 30 
minutes.93
Non-absorbable antibiotics
Rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, maintains high concentration 
levels in the intestine because it is not absorbed, and it remains in 
an active form until it is excreted.
It inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to bacterial DNA￾dependent RNA polymerase, and it has broad antimicrobial activi￾ty against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-nega￾tive bacteria.93 So far, several studies have shown that rifaximin 
has a positive effect in managing HE.242,249-251 Several RCTs with 
small sample sizes have assessed the effect of rifaximin as a first￾line regimen for OHE. A meta-analysis of those RCTs found that 
rifaximin had a therapeutic effect similar to that of lactulose or 
lactitol.249,251-254 Furthermore, in a recent RCT, patients treated 
with a combination of rifaximin and lactulose showed a better re￾covery from HE within 10 days (76% vs. 44%, P=0.004) and 
shorter hospital stays (5.8 vs. 8.2 days, P=0.001) than those 
treated with lactulose alone.255 The maximum dose is 1,200 
mg/day, which might limit its use in cases of severe HE (West-Ha￾ven criteria of grade 3 or more) because of the need for oral ad￾Table 4. Diagnostic tests to identify the precipitating factors of hepatic encephalopathy and their treatments

ministration.93
Neomycin and metronidazole are also poorly absorbed by the 
intestine, affect urea-producing bacteria, and reduce the genera￾tion of ammonia, which improves HE.93 However, they are not rec￾ommended for the management of HE because of their side ef￾fects, such as intestinal malabsorption, nephrotoxicity, and 
ototoxicity for neomycin and peripheral neuropathy for metronida￾zole.209,240,256
LOLA
Because ornithine and aspartate are important substrates used 
to metabolize ammonia to urea and glutamine, the administration 
of LOLA can lower plasma ammonia concentrations, with produc￾es improvements in HE.93,257 For patients with West-Haven criteria 
grade 1–2 HE, intravenous LOLA can lower the number connec￾tion test (NCT)-A time and plasma ammonia concentrations more 
effectively than placebo.258 According to a recent RCT, patients 
treated with the combination of lactulose and intravenous LOLA 
(30 g/day) had a lower grade of HE within 1–4 days of treatment, 
with an OR of 2.06–3.04 and a shorter duration until symptom 
recovery (1.92 vs. 2.50 days, P=0.002), compared with those who 
received lactulose alone.259 Oral LOLA can lower the NCT-A time 
and plasma ammonia concentrations;260,261 however, further stud￾ies are required to assess its efficacy in managing OHE.257
Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)
Among cirrhotic patients, the capacity for glycogen storage in 
the liver decreases along with the reduced liver parenchyme. 
Therefore, catabolism becomes predominant because protein is 
required for gluconeogenesis. Because BCAAs, such as valine, 
leucine, and isoleucine, are absorbed in the peripheral tissue, pa￾tients with cirrhosis have a lower concentration of the BCAAs and 
a higher concentration of the aromatic amino acids in the blood 
compared with healthy people. Thus, BCAA supplementation in￾hibits proteolysis and decreases the influx of toxic materials via 
the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, it plays an important role in 
muscle metabolism, leading to glutamine production that is useful 
for detoxifying ammonia.262,263 According to recent meta-analy￾ses,264-266 oral BCAAs might be beneficial in managing OHE and 
should be used as an ancillary pharmacological option. However, 
intravenous BCAAs have no effect on episodic HE.209,240,267
Others
Because albumin has great anti-inflammatory and immunomod￾ulatory properties, it might be helpful in improving the overall 
survival time of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.268-270
According to recent research in patients with West-Haven criteria 
grade ≥2 HE,271 those treated with a combination of lactulose 
and intravenous albumin (1.5 g/kg/day) showed a better recovery 
rate within 10 days than those treated with lactulose alone (75% 
vs. 53.3%, P=0.03) (Table 5).
In addition, polyethylene glycol (PEG), an osmotic laxative, 
might be tried. Its postulated mechanism of action is flushing am￾monia out of the gut, like the nonabsorbable disaccharides.240 A 
single RCT comparing PEG (4 liters over 4 hours via oral adminis￾tration or nasogastric tube) to lactulose only showed it to be su￾perior in terms of clinical improvement over a 24-hour period, 
documented by a greater decrement in the HE scoring algorithm 
(Δ 1.5 vs. Δ 0.7, P=0.002) and a shorter median time to resolu￾tion (1 day vs. 2 days, P=0.01).272 However, further studies are re￾Table 5. Pharmacological options for managing overt hepatic encephalopathy
Non-absorbable disaccharides Lactulose (20–30 g) should be administered orally 3–4 times per day (an equivalent daily dose of lactitol is 
67–100 g).
Goals: it should be administered orally until the patient is having at least 2 bowel movements a day. 
Thereafter, the dose should be titrated to achieve two to three soft stools per day. If patients cannot take

quired to assess its efficacy and safety.
Flumazenil, an antagonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, might 
improve consciousness among patients with severe HE; however, 
its effect is temporary, and survival time is not improved.273 There￾fore, it is not recommended as a first-line regimen. Nonetheless, it 
can be used in patients with HE caused by benzodiazepine. Levo￾carnitine or sodium benzoate might be effective in managing HE 
because they can lower plasma ammonia concentrations.274,275
Liver transplantation
Patient with acute liver failure and HE can be considered for liv￾er transplantation because of their poor prognosis.93 In cases of 
recurrent OHE, the severity is associated with its overall progno￾sis,276 and the overall survival rate after an episode of OHE was 
42% and 23% at 1 and 3 years, respectively.277 Therefore, liver 
transplantation should be considered for such patients. Further￾more, liver transplantation is also indicated in patients with severe 
HE who do not respond to the above medical treatments.
[Recommendations] 
1. Precipitating factors of HE include gastrointestinal bleeding, 
infection, constipation, infection, excessive intake of protein, 
dehydration, renal function disorder, electrolyte imbalance, 
psychoactive medication, and acute hepatic injury. So first, 
those factors should be recognized and managed. (A1)
2. To manage acute episodic overt HE, non-absorbable 
disaccharides (e.g., lactulose, lactitol) are recommended. 
Enema is recommended in severe HE (West Haven criteria 
grade ≥3) or a clinical situation in which oral intake is 
inappropriate. (A1) 
3. Rifaximin might be combined with non-absorbable 
disaccharides to treat patients with HE. (B1)
4. Oral BCAA and intravenous LOLA or albumin can be used 
additionally. (B2)
5. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with severe HE 
who do not respond to the medical treatments. (A1) 
Prevention of overt HE
Medical therapy
Among patients with OHE, 50–70% will experience a recur￾rence within 1-year, so secondary prevention for OHE should be 
started after the first event. As the first-line therapy, nonabsorb￾able disaccharides (lactulose,278,279 lactutol280) should be used. A 
dose of 30–60 mL of lactulose, allowing 2–3 stools per day, in 
patients who recovered from acute episodes of OHE significantly 
reduced the recurrence of OHE (19.6%) compared with the control 
group (46.8%).278 In cases of lactulose/lactitol intolerance, rifaxi￾min can be used as single therapy (400 mg tid or 550 mg bid).281
According to a case-control study that included decompensated 
liver cirrhosis patients, a median 2 years of rifaximin therapy sig￾nificantly lowered the recurrence of OHE compared with the con￾trol group (31.5% vs. 47%, P=0.034).281
A prospective RCT by Bass et al.282 found that 6-months of ri￾faximin therapy significantly lowered the recurrence of OHE com￾pared with the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 
0.28–0.64); about 91% of that study population used lactulose 
concomitantly. Non-absorbable disaccharide and rifaximin combi￾nation therapy can reduce the recurrence of OHE more than each 
single therapy,240,282 and it is therefore recommended for recurrent 
OHE. These medical treatments can effectively prevent OHE recur￾rence and improve the survival times of patients with OHE.281,283
Long-term treatment with rifaximin raised concerns about the risk 
of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, but recent studies 
found that C. difficile infection was not increased by rifaximin 
treatment compared with the control group.283-285
Long-term oral BCAA treatment is recommended for patients 
whose oral diet is insufficient because it can improve symptoms 
and reduce the recurrence of OHE.266,286 In a meta-analysis of 16 
RCTs, oral BCAA reduced the recurrence of OHE (HR, 0.73; 95% 
CI, 0.61–0.88), but the overall survival time did not differ be￾tween the two groups.266
LOLA can reduce the recurrence of HE. In an RCT including 150 
patients, oral LOLA (6 g three times per day) for 6 months signifi￾cantly reduced the recurrence of OHE (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17–
0.87).287 Nonetheless, recent meta-analyses have shown that oral 
LOLA was not more effective than lactulose or rifaximin for OHE 
prevention.287,288
In patients with intractable ascites, intravenous albumin infu￾sion can prevent OHE. A recent prospective RCT showed that 
long-term intravenous albumin (40 g per week) infusion signifi￾cantly lowered the risk of grade 3 or 4 OHE (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 
0.37–0.63) and improved overall survival times (HR, 0.62; 95% 
CI, 0.40–0.95).269
Education
A structured educational intervention has been reported to im￾prove patient adherence to prophylactic therapy and reduce re￾admission with OHE.289 According to an RCT of 39 patients with a 

107
The Korean Association for the Study of the Liver (KASL)

http://www.e-cmh.org https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2019.0010n
history of OHE, a 15-minute educational session reduced the risk 
of OHE-related hospitalization (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.02–0.77).269
The education of patients and caregivers should include 1) the ef￾fects and potential side effects (e.g., diarrhea) of the prescribed 
medication (lactulose, rifaximin, and so on), 2) the importance of 
adherence, 3) early symptoms and signs of recurring OHE, and 
4) actions to be taken if a recurrence begins.209
Nutritional management and exercise
Nutritional deficits and subsequent sarcopenia are known to in￾crease complications, including HE,290,291 and lower the overall 
survival times of cirrhotic patients.292-294 Therefore, adequate as￾sessment and intervention for nutritional status are recommend￾ed. Because most decompensated cirrhotic patients are malnour￾ished, daily energy intake should be 35–40 kcal/kg, and protein 
intake should be 1.2–1.5 g/kg. Long-term protein restriction 
should be avoided because it can induce protein catabolism, he￾patic dysfunction, and sarcopenia.295
To take in enough energy, small frequent meals (4–6 times per 
day including a night snack) improve the long-term prognosis for 
liver cirrhosis patients while preventing sarcopenia,296 but the di￾rect effect that small meals and a night snack has on OHE preven￾tion has not been fully established. 
Exercise can improve the long-term outcomes of cirrhotic pa￾tients.297,298 In particular, cirrhotic patients usually have decreased 
skeletal muscle volume291 because hyperammonemia hinders the 
synthesis of skeletal muscles.299,300 An adequate exercise program 
can prevent muscle loss,301 enhance effective ammonia metabo￾lism, and prevent OHE recurrence. However, exercise can tempo￾rarily increase the portal pressure in OHE patients,297,298 and it 
could increase the risk of a fall or fracture in malnourished pa￾tients. Therefore, adequate nutritional support should precede ex￾ercise therapy (Fig. 5). 
[Recommendations] 
1. A nonabsorbable disaccharide (lactulose, lactitol) or rifaximin, 
as single or combined therapy, is recommended for the 
prevention of overt HE recurrence. (A1)
2. Oral branched-chain amino acid or oral LOLA supplementation 
can prevent the recurrence of overt HE. (B1)
3. Adequate education of patients and caregivers at the time of 
discharge is needed to reduce the recurrence of overt HE. (B1)
4. Nutritional assessment and management are needed for 
decompensated liver cirrhosis patients who experienced overt

Covert HE
Definition
CHE is regarded as the preclinical stage of OHE, and it includes 
West-Haven criteria grade 1 and MHE, which is the mildest form 
of HE.210 It is difficult to diagnose CHE it because it can be diag￾nosed only by psychometric or neurophysiologic examination and 
is without definite clinical manifestations, such as disorientation 
or asterixis. Furthermore, it is difficult to clinically distinguish MHE 
and grade 1 HE. Therefore, MHE and grade 1 HE from the West￾Haven criteria are often defined as a single syndrome called CHE. 
Because the concept of CHE was initiated by ISHEN in 2011, most 
previous studies have been done on MHE; little research has been 
done on CHE, including West-Haven criteria grade 1 HE.210
The prevalence of MHE is 22–78% of patients with liver cirrho￾sis, although the rate can differ depending on the diagnostic 
method.226,302-308 The prevalence of MHE is related to prior epi￾sodes of OHE, age, severity of liver disease, and the presence of 
EVs.309 In a study using the psychometric HE score (PHES) in a sin￾gle institution in Korea, MHE was seen in 25.6% of patients with 
cirrhosis, including 20.2% of those in Child-Pugh A, 42.9% in 
Child-Pugh B, and 60% in Child-Pugh C.310
Clinical significance
Patients with CHE have impaired cognitive functions such as at￾tention, executive functions, visuospatial perception, psychomotor 
speed, and reaction times.311 Those impaired cognitive functions 
interfere with daily functioning, such as social interactions, alert￾ness, emotional behavior, sleep, home management, and recre￾ation, and lower the quality of life.214,304,312
Patients with CHE are at risk of falls and fractures,313,314 and 
their poor cognitive performance increases the risk that they will 
lose their jobs.315 Therefore, CHE increases the burden on both in￾dividual patients and society. CHE is regarded as the preclinical 
stage of OHE because of the increased risk of progression to 
OHE,226,302 and CHE is associated with worsened survival 
times.316,317 However, it is difficult to distinguish whether the 
shortened survival is caused by CHE or hepatic dysfunction.
Diagnosis
To diagnose CHE, the patient must have 1) a disease that can 
lead to CHE, such as liver cirrhosis or a portosystemic shunt, 2) no 
other neurological disease, 3) no neurological manifestation such 
as disorientation or asterixis, and 4) abnormal cognitive or neuro￾physiologic functioning.
Paper and pencil testing
One of the paper and pencil tests, PHES, consists of five tests 
(digit symbol test, NCT-A, NCT-B, serial dotting, and line tracing) 
that measure attention, psychomotor speed, visual perception, 
and visuo-spatial orientation.318 The PHES has been widely used 
to diagnose CHE and has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 
100%.319 It was developed in Germany and has been validated in 
several countries, including Korea.310,319-324 It is recommended that 
at least two of the NCT-A, NCT-B, block design test, and digit 
symbol test be performed if the full PHES cannot be used due to 
copyright issues or in places where the PHES has not been vali￾dated.208
The Korean paper and pencil test (KPPT) to evaluate MHE in 
Korean patients with liver cirrhosis was developed with the sup￾port of the Korean Association for the Study of the Liver.325,326 The 
KPPT consists of six tests: NCT-A, NCT-B, digit span test (DST), 
symbol digit modality test (SDMT), word list memory test, and 
Medical College of Georgia Complex figures. The KPPT short ver￾sion is configured to be relatively simple to use and contains the 
NCT-A, NCT-B, DST, and SDMT. A recent prospective multicenter 
study validated the KPPT short version in Korean patients with liv￾er cirrhosis.325 The KPPT is available at http://encephalopathy.
or.kr/inspection.326
Computerized testing
Inhibitory control test (ICT)
The ICT is a computerized test that evaluates attention, re￾sponse inhibition, and working memory.306,327 In the ICT, the sub￾ject is instructed to respond to alternating patterns of the letters 
X and Y, called the target. Non-alternating presentations of the 
letters X and Y, called lures, are randomly planted within the se￾quence of letters. This test evaluates the response times of the 
subjects and the response rate to the target and lures. The sensi￾tivity and specificity of the ICT are 87% and 77%, respectively, 
and it is highly reproducible.327 However, it has not been validated 
for Korean patients
Stroop test
The Stroop test evaluates psychomotor speed and cognitive 
flexibility328 using two components (the “off” and “on” states). In 
the “off” state, subjects match the color of the symbol. In the 
“on” state, subjects match the color of the word when the color 
of the word and the meaning of the word are incongruent, which 
evaluates response inhibition.

The computer-based Stroop test shows a sensitivity of 89.1% 
and a specificity of 82.1% when using the paper and pencil test 
as a standard test.329 A recent prospective multicenter study in the 
US showed that Stroop test had high sensitivity and acceptable 
inter-center agreement.330 In addition, the Stroop test has good 
test–retest reliability, and it has the advantage that it can be easi￾ly administered using a smartphone. A Korean Stroop test was 
developed, and a recent study showed that the Korean Stroop test 
is valid for diagnosing MHE (area under the curve, 0.74; 95% CI, 
0.66–0.83, P<0.001).331 The Korean Stroop test is available at 
http://encephalopathy.or.kr/inspection.326
Neurophysiological testing
EEG
EEG is a test that reflects cerebral cortical neuronal activity. In 
patients with CHE, a quantitative EEG analysis shows an increase 
in the relative power of the θ band and a decrease in the mean 
dominant frequency.332 However, EEG can be affected by various 
conditions that can affect cortical function. In addition, it requires 
a technician and a neurologist and is associated with both in￾terobserver and intraobserver variability.
Critical flicker frequency (CFF)
CFF measures the frequency at which light begins to flicker no￾ticeably. CFF is highly correlated with paper and pencil testing.333
In a meta-analysis of nine studies using CFF, the sensitivity and 
specificity for diagnosing CHE were 61% and 79%, respectively.334
However, it is not applicable to patients with red-green blindness 
or Korean patients with cirrhosis because it has not been validat￾ed in Korea.
Other tests
The animal naming test (ANT) is a semantic fluency test that 
consists of listing the names of as many animals as possible in 1 
minute. In a prospective study conducted in Italy, the sensitivity 
and specificity of the ANT for diagnosing CHE were 78% and 
63%, respectively, when the cut-off was less than 15, and the 
ANT was a significant predictor for the development of OHE.307 In 
a recent prospective study in Germany, the sensitivity and speci￾ficity were 31% and 98%, respectively, when the cut-off was less 
than 15, and they suggested 23 as a cut-off to increase sensitivi￾ty.335 Nabi et al.336 reported that a combination of age, sex, and 
the responses to 4 Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) questions that are 
highly related to CHE identified patients with CHE with more than 
80% sensitivity. However, that test needs to be validated further. 
Some studies reported that serum cytokines, such as interleukin 
(IL)-6, IL-17a, interferon-γ337-339 and 3-nitrotyrosin,340,341 are asso￾ciated with CHE. However, further studies are needed on the 
pathophysiology of CHE and the role of the markers in CHE.
Diagnosis and screening
CHE has no clinical signs of HE. It can show abnormalities in 
cognitive functions in various fields, but each field is not reduced 
to the same extent. In addition, because one test cannot judge 
the abnormality in all fields and agreement is poor between 
tests,342,343 a combination of least two tests is recommended for a 
diagnosis of CHE.210 For multicenter studies, a paper and pencil 
test and one computerized or neurophysiologic test are recom￾mended for a CHE diagnosis. A single institution can use one test 
that has been validated locally.209
Because CHE decreases patient quality of life, increases socio￾economic burden, and hastens mortality, it might be necessary to 
test and diagnose all patients at risk. However, that would in￾crease costs. Therefore, it is advisable to perform a diagnostic test 
in patients with a history recent of falls or traffic accidents and 
patients who report a low quality of life or complaints about daily 
living, such as those who complain of sleep disturbance or a loss 
of concentration or memory.209,344
Because most patients with CHE are diagnosed at an outpatient 
clinic, the screening tests should be performable without any spe￾cial tools and with high sensitivity, such as the four questions 
from SIP, the ANT, and the Stroop test using a smartphone.
Treatment
Most studies about treating CHE were performed in a small 
number of patients with a short duration of treatment. In addi￾tion, most studies have focused on improving cognitive function 
and quality of life; studies are still needed on extending survival 
and reducing readmissions or the development of OHE.
As with OHE, it is known that nitrogenous substances, especial￾ly ammonia, play a major role in CHE. Therefore, treatments can 
be given to reduce ammonia. The most studied treatment is lactu￾lose, which showed a marked improvement in cognitive function 
and quality of life304,345 and decreased the development of OHE,345
compared with the placebo.
Probiotics alter the gut microbiome and inhibit ammonia pro￾duction in the intestine, thereby improving cognitive function and 
decreasing the development of OHE.346-348 However, studies on 
the effects of probiotics in patients with CHE have low evidence

levels.349 Additional studies are needed to determine the benefi￾cial probiotic species and optimal doses. Rifaximin and nonab￾sorbable antibiotics also improved cognitive function and quality 
of life305 and improved driving ability.350 However, rifaximin failed 
to establish non-inferiority over lactulose in non-inferiority stud￾ies,351 and lactulose treatment is more cost-effective than rifaxi￾min therapy.350 Therefore, further studies on the role of rifaximin 
in the treatment of CHE are warranted. Although LOLA,352
BCAA,353 acetyl L-carnitine,354,355 and nutrition therapy308 have 
been reported to improve cognitive function, there is still a lack of 
evidence for those treatments.
[Recommendations] 
1. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the KPPT or the Korean Stroop 
test can be used to diagnose CHE. (B2)
2. Treatment with lactulose (B1) or rifaximin (B2) can be used 
to improve cognitive function and quality of life in patients with 
CHE.
HE and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
HRQoL in patients with cirrhosis is lower than that of patients 
with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis. The HRQoL of cirrhotic 
patients with HE is particularly low.356 Patients with HE suffer 
from various degrees of altered consciousness, personality chang￾es, impaired intellectual functioning, and neuromuscular dysfunc￾tion. Although HE is not immediately life-threatening, it can 
greatly interfere with a patient’s functioning, social interactions, 
and sense of well-being.357 The occurrence of HE is associated 
with various complications that can also adversely affect HRQoL. 
Therefore, the independent effect of HE on HRQoL is not easily 
measured. Because patients with OHE are unaware of their dis￾ease (anosognosia),358 alterations in their behavior and abilities 
are more easily recognized by the people living with them than by 
the patients themselves. The presence of OHE negatively affects 
both mental and physical functioning, whereas MHE mainly has 
negative effects on mental health. Several studies have shown 
that the HRQoL of patients with MHE is lower than that of pa￾tients without HE.312,359-362 Therefore, we suggest that patients 
with cirrhosis should be screened for the early detection and 
treatment of HE to improve their HRQoL.
Measuring of health-related quality of life in patients with 
HE
HRQoL is measured using self-administered, standardized ques￾tionnaires in which patients report their health status. The ques￾tionnaires are classified as generic and disease-specific.363 Be￾cause generic questionnaires provide an overview of HRQoL, 
usually taking into account the physical, mental, and social as￾pects of a patient’s health status, generic questionnaires have the 
advantage of depicting the relative impacts of different diseases. 
However, generic questionnaires have the disadvantage of insen￾sitivity to clinically important changes. Thus, generic question￾naires are often combined with disease-specific questionnaires. 
The most widely used generic questionnaires for measuring 
HRQoL are the SIP, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and Medical 
Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36).364 The SIP consists of 136 
items that measure 12 domains. It requires several minutes to 
complete, and patients with cognitive dysfunctions sometimes fail 
to complete it.365 The NHP measures distress and is useful in pa￾tients with moderate or severe disability, but it is not very sensi￾tive to mild disability.366 The SF-36 is applicable to a wide range 
of patients, from those with a severe disability to the general 
population. The SF-36 is easy to complete and has high sensitivity, 
which makes it the best and most widely used scale in clinical 
practice. It contains 36 questions that are split into eight domains 
and provides a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental 
component summary (MCS) (Supplementary Table 1).367
Disease-specific questionnaires have been developed for a vari￾ety of chronic diseases, such as renal failure, heart failure, liver 
cirrhosis, diabetes, and osteoarticular diseases, that greatly affect 
the HRQoL of patients. Liver-disease-specific questionnaires in￾clude the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), Liver Dis￾ease Quality of Life (LDQOL), Short Form Liver Disease Quality of 
Life (SF-LDQOL), and Liver Disease Symptom Index 2.0 (LDSI). The 
CLDQ comprises 29 questions split into six domains, with domain 
scores and an overall score presented as 1–7 scales. Higher scores 
on the CLDQ represent better HRQoL. The CLDQ is short, easily 
applicable, and correlates with the severity of liver disease.368 The 
LDQOL uses the SF-36 and adds 12 liver-specific scales compris￾ing 75 questions. All scales are scored from 0–100, with higher 
scores representing better HRQoL.369 The SF-LDQOL uses the SF￾36 and adds 36 Likert questionnaires; it is also scored from 
1–100.370 The LDSI uses 18 items to measure the impact and se￾verity of a patient’s liver disease on daily activities in nine areas 
(Supplementary Table 2).371

Influence of HE on health-related quality of life
Although there is a large consensus about the direct and pro￾found effect that HE has on HRQoL, most studies have focused on 
MHE.208,372,373 A small study about the HRQoL of patients with and 
without HE compared 18 patients experiencing OHE with 57 pa￾tients without a previous episode. Patients with a previous epi￾sode of OHE had significantly low SF-36 PCS and MCS scores. 
However, patients with MHE were affected in only one domain, 
physical functioning, of the SF-36.374 One study of 160 cirrhotic 
patients undergoing liver transplantation found that patients with 
MHE or OHE had a lower MCS than patients without HE.357
Cognitive impairment of patients with HE mainly affects areas 
that require multiple and complicated functions, such as atten￾tion, visuospatial abilities, psychomotor speed, balance, and coor￾dination, rather than language or general intellect. In other words, 
patients can perform daily activities such as wearing clothes or 
using the toilet, but their overall planning or cognitive function 
and exercise performance might suffer.318 Because driving a vehi￾cle requires comprehensive performance and a strategic way of 
thinking, patients with MHE require attention while driving.375-378
Cirrhotic patients engaged in professions that required sustained 
attention and motor coordination are more severely affected by 
MHE than those with jobs that require mainly verbal abilities. In 
an outpatient cohort with cirrhosis, up to 60% of blue collar 
workers lost their jobs, versus only 20% of white collar work￾ers.236
A disruption of normal sleep-wake patterns is another early sign 
of HE,379 and regular sleep is a key indicator of perceived health 
status. Sleep disturbances are included as relevant items in the 
assessment of HRQoL in the NHP questionnaire, and sleep distur￾bances in patients with HE negatively affect HRQoL.380 Patients 
with MHE report a decrease in the quality of their sleep and in 
their physical and mental HRQoL.214,381
Psychological status and a patient’s mood can affect the course 
of a disease and treatment response, and depression affects so￾cial functioning, physical abilities, and health status.382 Cirrhotic 
patients suffer not only from liver disease itself, but also from de￾creased quality of life in the form of poor work performance and 
an increased risk of accidents. Therefore, there is a need for ex￾tensive social attention and research on public social support sys￾tems and economic support for cirrhotic patients. 
Effects of treatment on HE and health-related quality of 
life
Although many studies have aimed at improving HE, relatively 
few studies have aimed at a significant improvement in the 
HRQoL of patients with HE.383 Prasad et al.304 first investigated 
the effect of treatment-related improvements in cognitive function 
on HRQoL. Patients with MHE treated with lactulose for 3 months 
showed a significant improvement in their HRQoL on several SIP 
subscores, particularly in emotional behavior, mobility, sleep/rest, 
and recreation and pastimes. In an 8-week study of rifaximin 
therapy in patients with MHE, the patients showed significantly 
improved scores in both neuro-psychometric performance and the 
SIP.305 Another study reported that rifaximin therapy to prevent a 
recurrence in patients with HE favorably affected HRQoL as mea￾sured by CLDQ scores.384 Treating OHE patients with oral LOLA385
and MHE patients with acetyl-L-carnitine354 also improved HRQoL. 
However, a 60-day course of probiotic yogurt supplementation 
had no significant effects on HRQoL in 25 patients with cirrho￾sis.346
To date, insufficient studies have been done to establish an as￾sociation between improved HRQoL and treatments for OHE and 
MHE. Considering that 10% or more of cirrhotic patients have HE, 
and 50% of cirrhotic patients with MHE who have not been treat￾ed can progress to OHE within 4–24 months,386 it is necessary to 
change the paradigm of treatment to improve the HRQoL of pa￾tients.
[Recommendations] 
1. Active diagnosis and treatment of HE improves patient’s 
health-related quality of life. (A1) 
2. Health-related quality of life in patients with HE is assessed 
by self-administered, standardized questionnaires and 
can be measured using either generic or disease-specific 
questionnaires. (B2)
