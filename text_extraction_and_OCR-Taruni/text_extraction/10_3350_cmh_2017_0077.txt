Background/Aims: The most widely used method for diagnosing sarcopenia is the skeletal muscle index (SMI). Several 
studies have suggested that psoas muscle thickness per height (PMTH) is also effective for detecting sarcopenia and 
predicting prognosis in patients with cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the optimal cutoff values of PMTH 
for detecting sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients.
Methods: All cirrhotic patients who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan including L3 and 
umbilical levels for measuring SMI and transverse psoas muscle thickness, respectively, were included. Two definitions 
of sarcopenia were used: (1) sex-specific cutoffs of SMI (≤52.4 cm2
/m2
 in men and ≤38.5 cm2
/m2
 in women) for SMI￾sarcopenia and (2) cutoff of PMTH (<16.8 mm/m) for PMTH-sarcopenia.
Results: Six hundred fifty-three patients were included. The average age was 53.6±10.2 years, and 499 patients (76.4%) 
were men. PMTH correlated well with SMI in both men and women (P<0.001). Two hundred forty-one (36.9%) patients 
met the criteria for SMI-sarcopenia. The best PMTH cutoff values for predicting SMI-sarcopenia were 17.3 mm/m in men and 
10.4 mm/m in women, and these were defined as sex-specific cutoffs of PMTH (SsPMTH). The previously published cutoff 
of PMTH was defined as sex-nonspecific cutoff of PMTH (SnPMTH). Two hundred thirty (35.2%) patients were diagnosed 
with SsPMTH-sarcopenia, and 280 (44.4%) patients were diagnosed with SnPMTH-sarcopenia. On a multivariate Cox 
regression analysis, SsPMTH-sarcopenia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.944; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.144–3.304; P=0.014) was 
significantly associated with mortality, while SnPMTH-sarcopenia was not (HR, 1.446; 95% CI, 0.861–2.431; P=0.164).
Conclusions: PMTH was well correlated with SMI in cirrhotic patients. SsPMTH-sarcopenia was an independent predictor 
of mortality in these patients and more accurately predicted mortality compared to SnPMTH-sarcopenia. (Clin Mol

INTRODUCTION 
Sarcopenia is characterized by a decline in muscle mass, muscle 
strength, and physical activity.1
 In the past, sarcopenia was only 
considered part of the aging process.2
 However, recent studies have 
shown that sarcopenia is associated with impaired physical capa￾bility,3-5 poor quality of life, adverse metabolic effects, falls,6
 dis￾ability, mortality,7,8 and high healthcare expenditures.9 Therefore, 
sarcopenia is increasingly recognized as a progressive disease fre￾quently associated with various comorbidities and mortality.10
Malnutrition is common in patients with advanced liver diseas￾es, and malnutrition and sarcopenia frequently occur in patients 
with liver cirrhosis.11-15 A number of studies have reported that, in 
cases of cirrhosis, sarcopenia is an independent prognostic factor 
of prognosis.13-21 However, objective assessment of muscle mass in 
cirrhotic patients remains challenging. Various definitions and mea￾surement methods have been used to quantify and diagnose sar￾copenia. However, there is still no consensus on measurement and 
cutoff values.22
Radiological image analysis is being increasingly utilized to di￾agnose sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis.10 The skeletal muscle 
index (SMI), assessed by the cross-sectional area of several muscles 
on computed tomography (CT) at the L3 vertebral level, is the most 
widely used technique. SMI has been shown to be an independent 
predictor of mortality in cirrhotic patients.23-26 Abdominal muscles, 
including the psoas muscle, are appropriate to use for the assess￾ment of skeletal muscle mass, because abdominal muscle mass, un￾like appendicular muscle mass, is relatively independent of activity 
level.10 However, delineating the surface of different groups of mus￾cles is relatively complex, takes time and specific software is need￾ed for computation. Therefore, SMI is hardly generalizable to out￾patients.
A recent study used psoas muscle thickness measured on CT to 
diagnose sarcopenia.27 They measured transverse psoas muscle 
thickness, defined as diameter of the psoas muscle perpendicular 
to the longest axial diameter of the muscle at the umbilical level, 
and then normalized the value to the patient’s height by dividing 
transverse psoas muscle thickness by height. This psoas muscle 
thickness/height (PMTH) was easily calculated as muscle mass and 
was determined to be associated with mortality in patients with 
cirrhosis. This method does not require specific software and can be 
calculated quickly. However, the study did not correlate PMTH with 
other measurements, such as psoas muscle area or SMI. Also, sex 
differences in muscle mass were not considered, and 16.8 mm/m 
was suggested as a cutoff value for the definition of sarcopenia in 
all patients. Our study was performed to measure how well PMTH 
predicts outcomes in cirrhotic patients and to establish optimal 
PMTH cutoff values for detecting sarcopenia by sex.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We included all patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent an 
abdominal CT and laboratory tests at the Korea University Anam 
Hospital, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, and 
Wonju Severance Christian Hospital. Patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma and parenchymal renal disease were excluded. Liver 
cirrhosis was diagnosed histologically or clinically. The protocol 
was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the Korea Uni￾versity Anam Hospital and conformed to the ethical guidelines of 
the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki. A waiver of consent was ob￾tained, and the patient records were anonymized and de-identi￾fied prior to analysis.
Data collection
Data on age, sex, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), 
underlying liver diseases, and results of the baseline laboratory 
tests were collected for each patient. Baseline laboratory tests con￾sisted of platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR), se￾rum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), bilirubin, albumin, creatinine (Cr), and sodium levels. The 
Study Highlights
Sarcopenia is a common complication in patients with liver cirrhosis. Although the smooth muscle index (SMI) is the most widely used technique 
for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, delineating the surface of muscles is relatively complex, and specific software is need for computation. Previous 
studies suggested that psoas muscle thickness represents muscle mass and psoas muscle thickness/height (PMTH) is associated with prognosis of 
patients with liver cirrhosis. In this study, PMTH was a good substitute for SMI and an independent prognostic factor for mortality in cirrhotic pa￾tients. In addition, applying different cutoff values based on sex improves its prognostic value.

model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was calculated us￾ing the following equation: 9.57×loge (creatinine, mg/dL)+3.78× 
loge (bilirubin, mg/dL)+11.2×loge (INR)+6.43.28 Clinical, laboratory, 
and radiological data used for the analysis were obtained within 1 
week of the CT image used to quantify skeletal muscle mass.
Measurement of skeletal muscle area and definition 
of sarcopenia
Two axial images one at the L3 vertebral body and one at the 
level of the umbilicus were selected for each case. To determine 
PMTH, axial and transverse thickness of right psoas muscle was 
measured at the level of the umbilicus. Axial psoas muscle thick￾ness was defined as the largest diameter of psoas muscle on an 
axial view (Fig. 1). Transversal psoas muscle thickness was defined 
as the diameter of psoas muscle perpendicular to the axial diame￾ter. Psoas muscle thickness was normalized to the patient’s height. 
For SMI, skeletal muscle area (cm2
) was measured by a trained op￾erator with the NIH ImageJ software which enables specific tissue 
demarcation using previously reported Hounsfield unit thresholds 
(for skeletal muscle, -29 to +150).29 The skeletal muscle area at L3 
vertebra was normalized to the patient’s height squared (m2
). 
Sarcopenia was defined by previously published cutoffs: (1) sex￾specific cutoffs of SMI (≤52.4 cm2
/m2
 in men and ≤38.5 cm2
/m2
 in 
women) for SMI-sarcopenia14; (2) cutoff of PMTH (<16.8 mm/m)
for PMTH-sarcopenia (sex-nonspecific PMTH sarcopenia, SnPMTH￾sarcopenia).27
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package 
for the Social Science (SPSS) version 20.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., 
Armonk, NY, USA). All data are expressed as either mean±standard 
deviation for continuous variables or number of patients (percent￾age) for categorical variables. Groups were compared using the chi￾square test for categorical variables and Student’s t-test for quan￾titative variables. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 
were used to find the optimal values of sex-specific psoas muscle 
thickness/height (SsPMTH)-sarcopenia to predict SMI-sarcopenia. 
Survival time was calculated as the time interval from the date of 
the abdominal CT scan to death or to the end of the follow-up. Pa￾tients who had liver transplantation were censored at the time of 
liver transplantation. Survival curves were constructed using the 
Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were assessed by the log￾rank test. A Cox regression analysis was performed to find which 
variables were predictors of mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
CIs were calculated. A two-tailed P-value of less than 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Table 1 presents baseline characteristics of all included patients. 
A total of 653 patients were included. The average age was 
53.6±10.2 years and 499 patients (76.4%) were men. Alcoholic 
liver disease was the most common underlying liver disease (326 
patients, 49.9%), followed by chronic viral hepatitis (269 patients, 
41.0%). Most of the cause of chronic viral hepatitis was chronic 
hepatitis B (244 of 269 patients, 90.7%). The average MELD score 
was 11.4±4.8. Ascites was absent in 332 patients (50.8%), mild 
in 197 patients (30.2%), and moderate in 124 patients (19.0%).
Sarcopenia defined by SMI
Two hundred forty-one (36.9%) patients met the criteria for SMI￾sarcopenia. In this group, men and alcoholic liver disease were 
more common than those that did not meet the threshold for SMI￾sarcopenia (Table 2). Serum bilirubin level and the MELD score 
were significantly higher in patients with SMI-sarcopenia, while 
BMI and serum sodium level were significantly lower compared to 
Figure 1. Measurement of psoas muscle thickness/height at the level of 
the umbilicus on a computed tomography (CT) scan image. Axial CT

those without SMI-sarcopenia. PMTH was significantly lower in the 
patients with SMI-sarcopenia compared to those without SMI-sar￾copenia (15.8±3.6 mm/m vs. 18.4±4.0 mm/m, P<0.001). On a 
multivariate binary regression analysis, the presence of SMI-based 
sarcopenia was independently associated with male sex (odds ra￾tio [OR], 7.657; 95% CI, 4.190–13.992; P<0.001), lower BMI (OR, 
0.709; 95% CI, 0.661–0.761; P<0.001), and serum bilirubin level 
(OR, 1.068; 95% CI, 1.013–1.125; P=0.015) (Table 3).
Sarcopenia defined by PMTH
PMTH was significantly higher in men than in women (18.1±3.8 
mm/m vs. 15.2±3.9 mm/m, P<0.001). PMTH was well correlated 
with SMI (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 0.526; P<0.001) (Fig. 
2A). The Pearson’s correlation coefficient differed between men 
(0.505, P<0.001) (Fig. 2B) and women (0.380, P<0.001) (Fig. 2C). 
Following previous cutoff value, PMTH was less than 16.8 mm/m 
in 290 patients (44.4%) and they were defined as sex-nonspecific 
psoas muscle thickness/height (SnPMTH)-sarcopenia. 
The AUROCs of PMTH for predicting SMI-sarcopenia were 0.779 
(95% CI, 0.739–0.819) in men (Fig. 3A) and 0.842 (95% CI, 0.772–
0.912) in women (Fig. 3B). The best cutoff values for predicting 
SMI-sarcopenia were 17.3 mm/m in men (sensitivity, 65.3%; speci￾ficity, 76.3%) and 10.4 mm/m in women (sensitivity, 31.2%; spec￾ificity, 90.6%). Using these cutoff values, sarcopenia was diag￾nosed in 230 patients (35.2%) and they were defined as SsPMTH￾sarcopenia.
When sarcopenia was diagnosed using the SnPMTH-sarcopenia, 
more women were defined as sarcopenic. Serum bilirubin level was 
significantly higher in patients with SnPMTH-sarcopenia, while 
BMI, serum albumin, and creatinine levels were significantly low￾er. The MELD score did not differ between the two groups 
(11.8±4.9 vs. 11.1±4.7, P=0.083) (Table 2). On multivariate binary 
regression analysis, the presence of SnPMTH-sarcopenia was in￾dependently associated with female sex (OR, 4.794; 95% CI, 
3.046–7.545; P<0.001), lower BMI (OR, 0.777; 95% CI, 0.734–
0.822; P<0.001), and serum albumin level (OR, 0.486; 95% CI, 
0.366–0.645; P<0.001) (Table 4).
When sarcopenia was defined with SsPMTH-sarcopenia, men 
and those with alcoholic liver disease were more frequently defined 
as sarcopenic. Serum bilirubin level and the MELD score were sig￾nificantly higher in patients with SsPMTH-sarcopenia, while BMI 
and serum sodium level were significantly lower (Table 2). On mul￾tivariate binary regression analysis, the presence of SsPMTH-sar￾copenia was independently associated with sex (OR, 5.558; 95% 
CI, 3.109–9.937; P<0.001), lower BMI (OR, 0.759; 95% CI, 0.712–
0.810; P<0.001), alcoholic liver disease (OR, 1.592; 95% CI, 1.080–
2.346; P=0.019), and serum albumin level (OR, 0.417; 95% CI, 
0.288–0.603; P<0.001) (Table 5).
Mortality
Cumulative survival rate differed significantly according to the 
presence of sarcopenia (Fig. 4). With the definition of sarcopenia 
by SMI, survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 97.7%, 93.3%, and 
88.3%, respectively, in patients without sarcopenia, while those 
were 86.2%, 81.0%, and 78.8%, respectively, in patients with 
sarcopenia (P<0.001) (Fig. 4A). With the definition of sarcopenia by 
sex-nonspecific cutoff of PMTH the survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years 
were 95.3%, 91.5%, and 88.4%, respectively, in patients without 
sarcopenia, while those were 91.4%, 85.6%, and 80.6%, respec￾tively, in patients with sarcopenia (P=0.024) (Fig. 4B). With the def￾inition of sarcopenia by sex-specific cutoff of PMTH, survival rates

at 1, 2, and 3 years were 96.2%, 92.4%, and 89.7%, respectively, 
in patients without sarcopenia, while those were 90.2%, 84.1%, 
and 78.5%, respectively, in patients with sarcopenia (P=0.002) 
(Fig. 4C).
On a univariate Cox regression analysis, the presence of sarcope￾nia was significantly associated with mortality when any definition 
was applied. In addition, underlying liver disease, platelet count, 
INR, serum bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, and sodium levels were 
significantly associated with mortality (Table 6).
A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed after ad￾justing for underlying liver disease, platelet count, INR, bilirubin, 
albumin, Cr, and sodium levels. SMI-sarcopenia (HR, 1.841; 95% 
CI, 1.072–3.164; P=0.027) and SsPMTH-sarcopenia (HR, 1.818; 
95% CI, 1.056–3.130; P=0.031) were significantly associated with 
mortality, but there was no significant association between SnPMTH￾sarcopenia and mortality (HR, 1.613; 95% CI, 0.950–2.739; P=0.077) 
(Table 7).
DISCUSSION
In this study, PMTH was well correlated with SMI, and the AU￾ROC of PMTH for predicting sarcopenia defined by SMI was rela￾tively high in both men and women suggesting that PMTH is a 
more simple, objective, and readily available method to assess skel￾etal muscle mass. Similarly to previous studies, SMI-based sarco￾penia was predictive of mortality, independently of other possible 
confounders. Interestingly, we found that sex-specific PMTH-based 
sarcopenia was significantly associated with mortality, while sex￾nonspecific PMTH-based sarcopenia was not. 
A number of studies showed men had significantly more skele￾tal muscle mass than in women, even after adjustment for body 
weight and height.30-33 Moreover, the association between sarco￾penia and functional decline is stronger in men than in women.34,35
These differences may be a natural result of the different exposure 
of sex hormones and the greater amount of physical activity in men. 
In muscle quantification studies based on magnetic resonance im￾aging, the muscle mass of the psoas major showed significant sex 
differences while the rectus abdominis, latissimus dorsi, or thigh 
muscles did not.36,37 Reasons for these sex differences are still un￾known, but a greater functional requirement of trunk musculature 
might be associated with greater development of the psoas mus￾cle in men who perform more physical activities than women.38-40
Also, during growth, women experience a lower increase in waist 
circumference than men. This morphological difference in the ab￾dominal region might be associated with the difference in psoas 
muscle mass between the sexes.41-44
Recently, CT with image analysis programs is being increasingly 
used to assess skeletal muscle mass. Abdominal CT would be diffi￾cult to justify for muscle mass measurements alone due to cost and

radiation exposure. However, as most patients with liver cirrhosis 
have surveillance scans for detecting focal liver lesions,10 additional 
CT scans for measuring muscle mass are not usually needed.
Previous researchers have suggested that PMTH, measured on 
CT at the level of the umbilicus, may be predictive of mortality in 
cirrhotic patients independently of the MELD and MELD-Na scores. 
They also suggested that the optimal cutoff point of 16.8 mm/m 
be used to predict mortality in both sexes.27 However, contrary to 
other studies, when this cutoff value was applied, sarcopenia was 
more frequent in women than in men. Besides, the mean MELD 
score (11.8±4.9 vs. 11.1±4.7, P=0.083) and mortality (HR, 1.613; 
95% CI, 0.950–2.739; P=0.077) were not significantly different be￾tween patients with and without SnPMTH sarcopenia. These results 
could be indicative of weakness of SnPMTH in predicting prognosis 
of cirrhotic patients. As amount of muscle mass differs with gender 
(lower in females)25 after adjustment for height, applying different 
cutoff values based on sex would be more appropriate. Therefore, 
we found the sex-specific cutoffs of PMTH (<17.3 mm/m in men and 
<10.4 mm/m in women) to be the optimal values for predicting 
sarcopenia defined by SMI. Among 290 patients (44.4%) classified 
as sarcopenic by SnPMTH, 60 (9.2%) were classified as non-sar￾copenic by SsPMTH. Sarcopenia defined by sex-specific PMTH (HR, 
1.818; 95% CI, 1.056–3.130; P=0.031) was significantly associated 
with mortality.
It is hard to compare the results of the previous study and our 
current study due to the disparities between the cohorts. First, mean 
MELD score was higher in the previous study (16.0±7) than in our 
study (11.4±4.8). This was because only patients registered for de￾ceased donor liver transplantation were enrolled in the previous 
study, while we included all patients with liver cirrhosis who had an 
abdominal CT scan. Therefore, mortality at 6 months was higher in 
the previous study (12.3%) than in our study (3.7%). Second, the 
previous study included HCC patients (46%), who were excluded in 
our study in consideration of the impact of HCC on mortality. Our 
data more clearly shows the clinical effect of sarcopenia in cirrhotic 
patients. Lastly, mean BMI (23.6±3.8 kg/m2 vs. 26.2±4.7 kg/m2
) and 
mean PMTH was lower in our study. This disparity may have been 
caused by the differences in body size, lifestyle, and cultural back￾ground between Asian and Caucasian populations.45 However, the 
prevalence of sarcopenia is usually not higher in Asians compared 
to Caucasians, although mean BMI and mean muscle mass are low￾er in Asians. This difference may be due to the characteristics of old￾er Asian people, who have walked and performed more physical 
activities since their early adulthood because of the underdevel￾oped living conditions and transportation.

This study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective study, 
and PMTH was measured by only one clinician. We could not eval￾uate inter-observer variance, although several studies have already 
shown relatively good agreement between observers. Second, 
PMTH has inherent limitations. Transverse psoas muscle thickness 
was measured at the level of the umbilicus, but the level of the um￾bilicus may vary if ascites is present. However, umbilical level can 
be easily identified on a CT scan than given level of the lumbar sec￾tion, because sacralization of the L5 vertebrae and lumbar wedge 
fractures in patients with osteoporosis make detection of given 
lumbar level difficult.27 In a recent systematic review and meta-anal￾ysis on the impact of CT-assessed skeletal muscle mass on out￾comes in liver transplant candidates,22 only one study measured 
skeletal muscle mass using PMTH.27 Further studies validating the

efficacy of PMTH in patients with liver cirrhosis are needed. Lastly, 
assessment of muscle mass by CT scan also should be taken into 
account. Since muscle strength and amount of fat content is related 
to CT attenuation, CT attenuation is often lower in the muscles of 
cirrhotic patients compared to controls.25 It is uncertain whether 
sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients can be diagnosed with hounsfield 
unit alone. To overcome these limitations, numerous measurement 
methods have been suggested, however, few studies have directly 
compared the different methods so far. 
In conclusion, we found that PMTH measured on a single axial
