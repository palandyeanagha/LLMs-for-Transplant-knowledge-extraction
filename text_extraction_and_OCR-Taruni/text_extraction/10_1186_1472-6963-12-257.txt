Abstract
Background: A cost-effectiveness analysis of timely dialysis referral after renal transplant failure was undertaken
from the perspective of the Public Administration. The current Spanish situation, where all the patients undergoing
graft function loss are referred back to dialysis in a late manner, was compared to an ideal scenario where all the
patients are timely referred.
Methods: A Markov model was developed in which six health states were defined: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis,
kidney transplantation, late referral hemodialysis, late referral peritoneal dialysis and death. The model carried out a
simulation of the progression of renal disease for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients aged 40, who were
observed in a lifetime temporal horizon of 45 years. In depth sensitivity analyses were performed in order to ensure
the robustness of the results obtained.
Results: Considering a discount rate of 3 %, timely referral showed an incremental cost of 211 €, compared to late
referral. This cost increase was however a consequence of the incremental survival observed. The incremental
effectiveness was 0.0087 quality-adjusted life years (QALY). When comparing both scenarios, an incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio of 24,390 €/QALY was obtained, meaning that timely dialysis referral might be an efficient
alternative if a willingness-to-pay threshold of 45,000 €/QALY is considered. This result proved to be independent of
the proportion of late referral patients observed. The acceptance probability of timely referral was 61.90 %, while
late referral was acceptable in 38.10 % of the simulations. If we however restrict the analysis to those situations not
involving any loss of effectiveness, the acceptance probability of timely referral was 70.10 %, increasing twofold that
of late referral (29.90 %).
Conclusions: Timely dialysis referral after graft function loss might be an efficient alternative in Spain, improving
both patients’ survival rates and health-related quality of life at an affordable cost. Spanish Public Health authorities
might therefore promote the inclusion of specific recommendations for this group of patients within the existing
clinical guidelines.

Background
Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) [1]. In the last decades,
the progressive improvement of immunosuppressant
drugs has led to an increase in the survival of renal grafts.
It has been shown that the one-year survival rate of a renal
graft is above 90%. The five-year survival rate is neverthe￾less around 70% and survival after ten years is below 50%
[2]. Every year, therefore, many patients experience graft
function loss, being referred back to dialysis. In a recent
study carried out by Villa et al., it is estimated that around
4% of the Spanish patients in kidney transplantation would
be referred back to dialysis every year, adding up to almost
1,000 patients in 2010 [3].
Despite the existence of a number of clinical practice
guidelines, both at the national and the international
levels, there is no consensus on the right timing for dia￾lysis referral after graft function loss. Both the reticence
of clinicians to assume transplant failure and the reluc￾tance of patients to restart dialysis might be among the
causes of late dialysis referral. Moreover, kidney trans￾plantation management and research have traditionally
focused on immunosuppressant therapy and on the
management of complications, rather than on the condi￾tion of patients restarting dialysis.
Following the international recommendations, there
are two situations in which patients should start Renal
Replacement Therapy (RRT) [4-6]: (1) Glomerular Filtra￾tion Rate (GFR) below 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 (i.e. Stage 5
of CKD) and presence of uremic complications; and (2)
GFR below 6 ml/min/1.73 m2
, even in the absence of
symptoms. In the case of elder patients or in the pres￾ence of comorbidities, it is however recommended an
early RRT start, even though GFR is above 15 ml/min/
1.73 m2 and there is absence of symptoms. Recent stud￾ies propose however that dialysis initiation is justified at
GFR levels from 5 to 9 ml/min/1.73 m2 if accompanied
by symptoms [7].
Arias et al. found that patients experiencing graft func￾tion loss presented GFR of 9 ml/min/1.73 m2 at the time
of hemodialysis restart, with 78 % of the patients show￾ing GFR of less than 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 [8]. Likewise,
Gill et al. found GFR of 8.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 for a similar
group of patients [9]. In both cases, GFR was below the
current recommendations. Late dialysis referral usually
involves a non-scheduled (non-programmed, non￾planned or urgent) dialysis restart, what has important
clinical [10,11] and economic [3,12] implications, such
as higher undernourishment, worse anemic control,
higher morbidity and mortality rates, and consequently
larger costs. Furthermore, patients undergoing graft
function loss show higher recombinant human erythro￾poietin (rHuEPO) [13] and intravenous iron (IV) [14]
needs, experience higher hospitalization rates due to access
complications [7] and face increased morbidity and mortal￾ity risks [8,15-20]. Because of that, a timely dialysis restart
would be advisable for these patients as soon as they reach
Stage 5 of CKD.
This article studies the health outcomes and the eco￾nomic implications of late dialysis referral after graft
function loss. A cost-effectiveness analysis of timely dia￾lysis referral after renal transplant failure is undertaken
for the first time in Spain. The current Spanish situation
is compared to an ideal scenario in which all the patients
undergoing graft function loss are referred back to dialy￾sis in a timely manner.
Methods
A Markov chain model was programmed using Stata 10
data analysis software. Markov models are useful to rep￾resent random processes which evolve over time. They
are suited to modeling the progression of chronic dis￾eases. A specific disease is described as a chain of differ￾ent health states, and movements between those states
over discrete time periods (“cycles”) occur with a given
probability (“transition probability”). Estimates of health
outcomes and costs are attached to each state in the
model. By running the model over a large number of
cycles (“temporal horizon”), the long-term health out￾comes and costs associated with the disease are com￾puted (see [21] for a detailed introduction to Markov
modeling).
In our particular case, six health states were defined:
HD: hemodialysis; PD: peritoneal dialysis; Tx: kidney
transplantation; LRHD: late referral hemodialysis; LRPD:
late referral peritoneal dialysis; and D: death. The model
carried out a simulation of the progression of renal dis￾ease for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients aged 40,
the most frequent age for RRT initiation according to
expert judgment, who were observed in a lifetime tem￾poral horizon of 45 years. The model parameters and
their supporting references are presented in Table 1.
Transition probabilities determine the likelihood of pa￾tient flows between the health states defined from cycle
(a year) to cycle (Figure 1). Transition probabilities were
based on a recent study [3], with the exception of age￾dependent mortality probabilities, which were computed
using data from the Spanish Society of Nephrology (SEN,
Spanish acronym) registry [22] and assuming that late re￾ferral patients had a one-year survival rate of 73% [23]. All
the model transitions were half-cycle corrected [24].
Based on the opinion of an expert panel of three clini￾cians, two alternative scenarios were considered:
▪ Scenario L. All the patients are referred back to
dialysis (both to HD and PD) in a late manner after
graft function loss (transition probabilities: Tx to
HD: 0.0000; Tx to PD: 0.0000; Tx to LRHD: 0.0350;

current Spanish situation, according to the expert
panel opinion.
▪ Scenario T. All the patients are referred back to
dialysis in a timely manner after graft function loss
(transition probabilities: Tx to HD: 0.0350; Tx to PD:
0.0035; Tx to LRHD: 0.0000; Tx to LRPD: 0.0000).
Scenario T represents an ideal situation.
Following a Public Administration perspective, direct
medical costs (in January 2012 €), including the costs of
the vascular (HD) or peritoneal (PD) accesses; access
complications; delivery of training; treatment session;
kidney transplantation; drug consumption; equipment
depreciation and maintenance; Nephrology Service gen￾eral expenses; utilities; and external services, were con￾sidered. HD, PD and Tx transition and prevalence costs
were collected from a recent study. Transition (inci￾dence or first-year) costs include the costs of the vascu￾lar access (HD), the costs of the peritoneal access and
training (PD), and the costs of transplantation surgery
(Tx).
LRHD and LRPD costs were based on that same
methodology [12], but taking into account some consid￾erations. It was considered that LRHD patients required
a higher (Δ97%) number of days of hospitalization due
to access complications than HD patients did [7]. It was
further considered that, during the first year, LRHD and
LRPD patients showed higher (Δ69 %) rHuEPO [13] and
higher (Δ47%) IV [14] needs than HD and PD patients
did. Moreover, both LRHD and LRPD patients were con￾sidered as non-scheduled (i.e. they start dialysis in a
non-planned, non-programmed or urgent form). Per￾patient annual transition costs were: 2,545 € (HD)
< 6,627 € (LRHD) and 1,819 € (PD) < 3,748 € (LRPD).
Effectiveness was expressed in terms of quality￾adjusted life years (QALY). QALY were defined as the
survival rate in a cycle times the health utility associated
with a given health state. Health utilities were assigned
values on a scale from 0 (the worst health state or death)
to 1 (the optimal or perfect health state). Utilities were
obtained from the existing literature [3,25]. Regarding
LRHD and LRPD utilities, we considered the average
(first year) post-transplant “good dialysis state” utility
reported by Laupacis et al. [25]. This study has been
cited by a number of relevant studies for similar pur￾poses [28-31]. This estimate presents however some lim￾itations. First, patients (and not the society) were asked
to evaluate hypothetical health states using the time
trade-off method. Second, health states evaluated were
not based on generic quality of life instruments.
Both costs and health utilities were applied a 3% dis￾count rate [27]. As for the cost-effectiveness compari￾sons, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was
computed and a willingness-to-pay threshold (WTPT) of
45,000 €/QALY [26] was assumed.
For the purpose of contrasting the robustness of the
results, univariate and probabilistic (Monte Carlo simu￾lation) sensitivity analyses were carried out. In the uni￾variate case, each single model parameter was changed
(a 10% increase or decrease) at a time and a new ICER
was computed. In the probabilistic case, 1,000 new ICER
were computed by changing all the model parameters
simultaneously. Beta distributions were assumed for the

transition probabilities, normal distributions were
assumed for the health utilities, log-normal distributions
were assumed for the costs and a uniform distribution
was assumed for the discount rate [32]. Due to data un￾availability and when required, standard deviations were
assumed to be a 10% of the mean values. The cost￾effectiveness plane and the confidence ellipse (95% con￾fidence level) were developed. The probabilities of
accepting the two scenarios proposed as a function of
the WTPT (acceptability curves) were also computed.
Results
Cost-effectiveness results are shown in Table 2. Per￾patient annual costs and QALY are presented for both
scenarios, as well as comparative measures between
them.
Considering a discount rate of 3%, Scenario T showed
an incremental average (per-patient and year) cost of
211 €, compared to Scenario L. This average cost in￾crease was however due to the incremental average sur￾vival observed in Scenario T. The incremental
effectiveness was 0.0087 QALY. When comparing both
scenarios, an ICER of 24,390 €/QALY was obtained,
meaning that Scenario T is an efficient alternative if we
consider a WTPT of 45,000 €/QALY.
The univariate sensitivity analysis showed that model
results were robust. The ICER did not change signifi￾cantly when alternative discount rates of 0% (24,135
€/QALY) or 5% (24,405 €/QALY) were considered. Only
three model parameters caused absolute value changes
in the ICER exceeding a 10% threshold: HD and LRHD
prevalence costs, and HD utilities (Figure 2). A max￾imum ICER of 29,869 €/QALY, yet below the WTPT,
was obtained by increasing the prevalence cost of HD in
a 10%. Finally, a 10% increase in the utility of LRHD
patients caused a 6.01% increase in the ICER, meaning
that the influence of this parameter on the results is
limited.
In this study, two extreme situations were considered
in which either all the patients were referred back to dia￾lysis in a late manner (Scenario L) or all of them were
timely referred (Scenario T). A univariate sensitivity ana￾lysis was conducted on the proportion of patients who
were referred back to dialysis in a late manner. As
expected, it was concluded that the higher the propor￾tion of late referral patients considered, the lower the
ICER obtained. The ICER was furthermore below the
WTPT for any proportion of late referral patients, ran￾ging from 24,428 €/QALY (proportion of late referral
patients equal to 0.01) to 24,390 €/QALY (Scenario L).
Timely dialysis referral was therefore an efficient alterna￾tive for any proportion of late referral patients observed.
The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Table 2, Figure 3)
showed that, given a WTPT of 45,000 €/QALY, Scenario
T was a dominant alternative in 27.80%, efficient with
higher effectiveness in 27.60% and efficient with lower
costs in 6.50% of the simulations. In contrast, Scenario L
was a dominant alternative in 20.20%, efficient with
lower cost in 14.70% and efficient with higher effective￾ness in 3.20% of the simulations. The acceptance prob￾ability of Scenario T was 61.90%, while Scenario L was
acceptable in 38.10% of the simulations. If we however
restrict the analysis to those situations not involving any
loss of effectiveness (i.e. situations of dominance and
efficiency with higher effectiveness), the acceptance
probability of Scenario T was 70.10%, doubling that of
Scenario L (29.90%). Figure 4 shows the acceptability
curves of the two scenarios considered for any WTPT
ranging from 0 €/QALY to 90,000 €/QALY.
Discussion
This study presented a cost-effectiveness analysis of
timely dialysis referral after renal transplant failure in
Spain from the perspective of the Public Administration.
Late dialysis referral after graft function loss usually
involves a non-scheduled dialysis restart that has import￾ant clinical and economic implications, such as higher
undernourishment, worse anemic control, higher mor￾bidity and mortality rates, and consequently larger costs
incurred. The health outcomes and the economic
resources associated with late dialysis referral after graft
function loss were discussed and quantified.
A Markov chain model was developed and the current
Spanish situation, where the great majority of patients
are referred back to dialysis in a late manner, was com￾pared to an ideal scenario in which all the patients
undergoing graft function loss were timely referred. In
depth sensitivity analyses were performed in order to en￾sure the robustness of the results obtained.
LRHD and LRPD patients presented lower survival
rates and health utilities, and higher transition and
prevalence costs than HD and PD patients did. Assum￾ing a WTPT of 45,000 €/QALY, timely dialysis referral
might be an efficient alternative when compared to the
current Spanish situation. This result proved to be inde￾pendent of the proportion of late referral patients con￾sidered, since the ICER was below the WTPT for any
proportion of late referral patients.
Timely dialysis referral implied a moderate increase in
total costs. This cost increase was nevertheless caused
by the increased survival rates observed in the timely re￾ferral scenario, since all the prevalent patients require a
lifelong treatment. In real life, the additional costs asso￾ciated with starting dialysis 6 or 12 months earlier might
also contribute to a cost increase. Simulations were re￾run only considering those situations not involving any
loss of effectiveness. Following this approach, the accept￾ance probability of timely dialysis referral increased

twofold that one of the current Spanish scenario. Based
on these results, nephrologists might inform patients on
the increased morbidity and mortality risks associated
with late dialysis referral.
A limitation of this study is that costs and outcomes
in our model are mainly based on single punctual esti￾mates gathered from the existing literature, due to un￾availability of micro-data in our country. We were
therefore unable to attach confidence intervals to the
vast majority of model parameters and had to assume a
dispersion of 10% of the central value for all the model
parameters. We suspect that the ICER dispersion might
be overestimated in our model and therefore the results
of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis should be taken
with caution.
It is worth noting that late referral patients are also
expected to incur higher loss of labor productivity costs
due to morbidity and mortality than timely referral
patients do. A second limitation of this study is that a
Public Administration perspective was adopted rather
than including indirect costs (societal perspective), since
reliable estimates of the unemployment and retirement
rates for late referral patients are not available in Spain
and further research would be required. In an explora￾tory analysis, we quantified loss of labor productivity
costs due to mortality in 29,345 € per death and year for
RRT patients under 67 years old [12,33], resulting in an
ICER of −146 €/QALY when included in the model. The
inclusion of loss of labor productivity costs due to mor￾bidity is expected to reduce the ICER obtained, further
validating the timely referral approach proposed.
Conclusions
Timely dialysis referral after graft function loss might be
an efficient alternative in Spain, improving both patients’
survival rates and health-related quality of life at an
affordable cost. Spanish Public Health authorities might
promote the inclusion of specific recommendations for
this group of patients within the existing clinical guide￾lines, also monitoring their proper implementation and
outcomes.
