Background/Aims: Biliary complications are the most common donor complica￾tion following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The aim of this study is 
to investigate the long-term outcomes of biliary complications in right lobe adult￾to-adult LDLT donors, and to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic treatment of 
these donors.
Methods: The medical charts of right lobe donors who developed biliary compli￾cations between June 2000 and January 2008 were retrospectively reviewed.
Results: Of 337 right lobe donors, 49 developed biliary complications, including 
36 diagnosed with biliary leakage and 13 with biliary stricture. Multivariate anal￾ysis showed that biliary leakage was associated with the number of right lobe bile 
duct orifices. Sixteen donors, five with leakage and 11 with strictures, underwent 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). ERC was clinically successful in 
treating eight of the 11 strictures, one by balloon dilatation and seven by endobi￾liary stenting. Of the remained three, two were treated by rescue percutaneous 
biliary drainage and one by conservative care. Of the five patients with leakage, 
four were successfully treated using endobiliary stents and one with conservative 
care. In overall, total 35 improved with conservative treatment. All inserted stents 
were successfully retrieved after a median 264 days (range, 142 to 502) and there 
were no recurrences of stricture or leakages during a median follow-up of 10.6 
years (range, 8 to 15.2).
Conclusions: All donors with biliary complications were successfully treated 
non-surgically, with most improving after endoscopic placement of endobiliary 
stents and none showing recurrence on long term follow-up.

INTRODUCTION
The first successful adult-to-adult right lobe living 
donor liver transplantation (LDLT) was performed in 
Japan in 1994 [1]; since then, this procedure has been 
widely and increasingly performed. A worldwide short￾age of deceased donors has resulted in LDLT becoming 
a major treatment strategy for end-stage liver diseases, 
including hepatocellular carcinoma [2-5]. Donor safety 
is as important as recipient safety and efficacy, resulting 
in donor ethical issues with regard to this procedure [2-
4,6,7]. The morbidity and mortality rates for liver graft 
donors have been reported to be about 21% and 0.2% 
to 0.5%, respectively [6]. The most frequent donor com-

plications following LDLT are biliary complications. 
Recent studies have reported that 6% to 9% of donors 
experience biliary complications following LDLT [6-9] 
and that these complications are more common in right 
lobe than in left lobe donors [10,11]. Although most bil￾iary complications are minor or transient and improve 
with conservative care, some require endoscopic, percu￾taneous, or surgical treatment and even long-term hos￾pitalization. To date, however, few reports have assessed 
biliary complications experienced by right lobe donors 
after partial liver resection [10-13]. The present study de￾scribes the long-term outcomes of biliary complications 
in right lobe LDLT donors in our center, and the effica￾cy of endoscopic treatment for these complications. 
METHODS
Between June 2000 and January 2008, 394 liver trans￾plantation procedures were performed at Seoul St. Mary 
Hospital, South Korea. Of those, 341 were LDLT, with 
four involving left lobe donors and 337 involving right 
lobe donors. The baseline characteristics of the 337 right 
lobe donors are shown in Table 1. Their median age was 
30 years (range, 16 to 62), and 221 (65.6%) were male. All 
donors underwent open hepatectomy. Intraoperative 
cholangiography of the intrahepatic duct (IHD) showed 
that 234 (69.4%) were classified as type I (i.e., the com￾mon hepatic duct was formed by fusion of the right and 
left hepatic ducts, and the right hepatic duct was formed 
by fusion of the right anterior segmental duct and right 
posterior segmental duct); 17 (5.0%) as type II (i.e., the 
common hepatic duct was formed by the fusion of the 
right anterior segmental duct, the right posterior seg￾mental duct and left the hepatic duct); 40 (11.9%) as type 
III (i.e., the right posterior segmental duct drains into 
the left hepatic duct); and 46 (13.6%) as type IV (i.e., the 
right posterior segmental duct drains into the common 
hepatic duct) (Fig. 1). 
The number of bile duct orifices from the right lobe 
was defined as the number observed in the stump of 
the right hepatic duct after right lobe resection. Of the 
337 donors, 211 (62.6%), 117 (34.7%), seven (2.1%), and two 
(0.6%) had one, two, three, and four orifices, respectively 
(Table 1).

https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2017.264 www.kjim.org
Definition of biliary complications
Biliary leakage was diagnosed either when an operative￾ly installed drain contained ≥ 100 mL/day of bile-con￾taining fluid or when a needle aspirate of intraabdom￾inal fluid included bile juice. If leakage did not resolve 
following symptomatic care or percutaneous placement 
of a peritoneal drain, endoscopic retrograde cholangi￾ography (ERC) was performed to confirm the diagnosis 
and as initial treatment. Biliary stricture was diagnosed 
when computed tomography or magnetic resonance 
imaging showed proximal bile duct dilatation and bile 
duct stenosis, in addition to abnormal liver function test 
results. The severity of postoperative complications (i.e., 
biliary complications) was assessed using the five-tier 
Clavien-Dindo grading system [14].
Endoscopic procedures
All endoscopic procedures were performed after writ￾ten informed consent was provided. After an overnight 
fast, ERC was performed using a video duodenoscope 
(Fujinon ED-450XT5, Fujinon, Saitama, Japan). The leak￾age site was confirmed using contrast media. Following 
insertion of a 0.035-inch guidewire (Jagwire, Boston Sci￾entific, Boston, MA, USA) into the intrahepatic bile duct 
proximal to the leakage site, an endobiliary plastic stent 
was introduced over the leakage site, with or without 
an endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST). Biliary strictures 
were dilated using a balloon catheter, or an endobiliary 
plastic stent was inserted into the bile duct proximal 
to the stricture site with or without EST. The diameter 
of the endobiliary stent was based on the lumen size of 
the donor bile duct. Amsterdam-type biliary stents (7 to 
11.5 F in diameter, 10 to 16 cm in length; Medi-Globe, 
Achenmuhle, Germany) were used. ERC was again per￾formed 6 months later in an outpatient clinic, or earlier 
if acute cholangitis or obstructive jaundice developed or 
the endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) stent 
was dislodged. During the follow-up ERC, the previous 
stent was removed and the degree of improvement in 
biliary leakage was evaluated. The plastic stent was rein￾serted if the biliary complication remained or recurred 
after stent retrieval. ERC was considered clinically suc￾cessful if clinical, laboratory, and radiological abnormal￾ities improved. To confirm the long-term outcome of 
donors with biliary complication, we checked each do￾nor’s status by telephone calls before this study. 
This study conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 
1975 Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by our 
Institutional Review Board (KC17RESI0510). All patients 
provided informed consent before the treatment.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive data are expressed as median (range) or 
proportion. Predictive variables associated with biliary 
complications were assessed using logistic regression 
analysis. The evaluated variables were donor sex, age, 
and body mass index; serum concentrations of amino￾transferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin; 
the anatomy of the donor intrahepatic bile duct; the 
number of bile duct orifices in the right lobe; intraop￾Figure 1. Representative cholangiograms showing varia￾tions in the anatomy of the intrahepatic ducts of right lobe

to the severity of complications. Biliary complications 
were the most common postoperative complication 
(49/92, 53.2%), with median time to biliary complications 
being 13 days (range, 1 to 109) after donation. The medi￾an age of the 49 donors was 30 years (range, 16 to 53) and 
31 (63%) were male. The presenting symptoms and signs 
were fever (n = 6, 12%), jaundice (n = 11, 23%), collection 
of intra-abdominal fluid (n = 13, 28%), elevated liver en￾zymes (n = 16, 33%), and abdominal pain (n = 2, 4%). Of 
these 49 donors, 36 were diagnosed with biliary leakage 
and 13 with biliary strictures, including one patient with 
concomitant biliary leakage.
Univariate analysis of factors potentially associated 
with biliary complications showed that anatomical IHD 
type (p = 0.043) and the number of bile duct orifices in 
the donated right lobe (p = 0.008) was significantly asso￾ciated with biliary leakage (Table 2). In contrast, no do￾nor factors were associated with biliary stricture. 
Of the donors with IHD types I, II, III and IV, 8.5% 
(20/234), 11.8% (2/17), 15% (6/40), and 17.4% (8/46), re￾spectively, developed biliary leakage. Moreover, biliary 
leakage was observed in 9% (19/211), 11% (13/117), 28.6%

(2/7), and 100% (2/2), of the donors with one, two, three, 
and four biliary orifices, respectively. Anatomical IHD 
type was significantly associated with the number of 
bile duct orifices in the right lobe (p = 0.001), with mul￾tiple biliary orifices more frequently observed in donors 
with types II (14/17, 82.4%), III (38/40, 95%), and IV (45/46, 
97.8%) than type I (29/234, 12.4%) IHD. Three or more 
biliary orifices were detected only in donors with types 
II (1/17, 5.9%), III (5/40, 12.5%), and IV (3/46, 6.5%). Multi￾variate analysis found that the number of bile duct ori￾fices was the only factor independently associated with 
biliary leakage (p = 0.010). 
Of the 49 donors with biliary complications, 16 do￾nors, including five with leakage and 11 with strictures, 
underwent ERC; their clinical features and treatment 
outcomes are shown in Table 3. The median period be￾tween LDLT and ERC was 31.5 days (range, 7 to 51). The 
median number of ERC per donor was 2 (range, 1 to 5). 
None of these patients experienced any serious ERC-re￾lated complications, such as pancreatitis, bleeding, or 
infection. 
ERC was technically successful in nine of the 11 do￾nors with biliary strictures, including one with concom￾itant leakage, but unsuccessful in two patients. Of the 
latter, one improved without further management and 
the other underwent percutaneous biliary drainage due 
to aggravating jaundice. Of the nine donors who under￾went technically successful ERC, one underwent balloon 
dilation alone, whereas the other eight underwent in￾sertion of an endobiliary stent without ballooning, with 
(n = 7) or without (n = 1) EST. Of the nine donors with 
strictures who underwent technically successful ERC 
procedures, eight experienced successful clinical out￾comes, whereas one (Patient 1) required percutaneous

bin concentration and fever (Fig. 2). Drainage was suc￾cessful in treating fever and jaundice in this patient, 
allowing drain removal 1 month later. Two weeks later, 
however, this patient again developed fever and jaun￾dice, and a follow-up ERC showed that the endobiliary 
stent had migrated towards the smaller intrahepatic bile 
duct. The stent was removed, with no further recurrence 
of biliary complications for 15.2 years. Endobiliary stents 
were removed from the other seven patients removed 
after a median 254 days (range, 142 to 385), with follow-up 
ERC showing stricture improvement and no evidence 
of leakage (Fig. 3). None of these patients experienced 
recurrence of stricture or leakage during a median fol￾low-up of 11.2 years (range, 9.4 to 15.2). 
Of the five donors who underwent ERC due to leak￾age, four underwent endoscopic biliary drainage using 
a biliary stent. The remaining patient (Patient 12) had 
a subphrenic biloma and was treated conservatively be￾cause bile leakage was not evident on ERC (Fig. 4). The 
most frequent site of leakage was the anastomosis site 
of the resected right hepatic duct. The inserted endobi￾liary stents were retrieved at a median 205 days (range, 
148 to 336) following ERC (Fig. 5). Follow-up ERC showed 
no evidence of leakage in any patient. One patient (Pa￾tient 13), however, developed obstructive jaundice, with a 
stone found in the common bile duct 15 days after stent 
removal. This patient underwent basket stone removal, 
balloon dilatation of a suspicious biliary stricture, and 
endobiliary stent reinsertion. The stent was removed 
6 months later, with ERC showing no evidence of a 
stone or stricture in the bile duct. Following stent re￾moval, these five patients with leakage have shown no 
recurrence of stricture or leakage for a median 8.6 years 
(range, 8 to 14.2).

Thirty-five donors, 32 with leakage and three with 
strictures, showed improvements following conserva￾tive treatment, with none of these patients experienc￾ing recurrence during a median follow-up of 12.8 years 
(range, 8.9 to 16.3).
DISCUSSION
Although right liver LDLT is regarded as the primary 
treatment for selected adult patients with end-stage 
liver disease, concerns have been raised about donor 
safety. LDLT donors can experience various compli￾cations, with biliary complications being the most fre￾quent. However, a multicenter survey of several recent 
large scale studies showed that donor hepatectomy can 
be performed successfully, with minimal and easily 
controlled complications, by using a meticulous and 
well-standardized technique [15,16]. In contrast to large￾scale studies, single center studies like ours have several 
advantages. First, specific complications such as biliary 
complications could be handled in a more detailed and 
standardized fashion. Second, unexpected intraoper￾ative factors and/or pathologic factors may be identi￾fied as important predictors during the investigation. 
Therefore, this study is one of few focusing on the clin￾ical course of biliary complications and the outcomes 
of endoscopic management of these complications in 
LDLT donors at a single center. 
The present study found that the overall postopera￾tive complication rate was 27.2%. More than half of these 
were biliary complications (14.5%, 49/337), with 10.6% 
(36/337) of patients experiencing biliary leakage and 3.9% 
(13/337) having biliary strictures, including one donor 
who developed a stricture after resolution of the leakage. 
Donor morbidity rates associated with right hepatecto￾my for LDLT have been reported to range from 0% to 
67%, with an average incidence of 31% [17]. The overall 
rate of biliary complications in LDLT donors has been 
reported to range from 6% to 9%, but the incidence has 
been found to vary among studies from 1.0% to 11.1% 
[6-9]. These variations in incidence rate may be due to 
differences in surgical skills or inconsistent definitions 
of complications and their grades. The incidence of bil￾iary complications was somewhat higher in the present 
study than in previous studies. This higher incidence 
was likely due to our inclusion of only right lobe donors, 
who have been reported to have a higher rate of biliary 
complications, about 9% to 11% [10,11]. However, recent 
large-scale studies reported comparable outcomes in 
right lobe and left lobe donors [18-20]. These similar 
outcomes were likely due to strict donor selection and 
cumulative experience with surgical procedures and 
perioperative management [18-20].
We found that most biliary complications occurred 
during the early postoperative period. Biliary leakage 
has been found to occur more frequently in earlier than 
in late phase, with most of these patients showing im￾provements with conservative care. Biliary strictures de￾velop later, with most requiring specific interventional 
treatment [10,21,22]. In this study, 88.8% of patients with 
biliary leakages and 23% of patients with biliary stric￾tures showed improvement following conservative treat￾ment, findings consistent with those of previous reports 
[9,10,12,13,21,22]. All patients with biliary complications 
requiring ERC improved without requiring surgical 
management. ERC was technically successful in 81% of 
patients with strictures and 100% of those with leakage, 
and endobiliary stent insertion was clinically successful 
in 72.7% and 100%, respectively, with the remaining do￾nors responding to percutaneous treatment. Although 
the management of biliary leakage varies among studies, 
the approach to stricture is the same, endobiliary stent 
insertion. The technical and clinical success rates of 
ERC with stent insertion for stricture in this study were 
comparable to those of previous studies, although the 
numbers of events were very small [10,21,23]. 
In the present study, endobiliary stents were used to 
treat biliary leakage as well as strictures. Potential treat￾ments for leakage include sphincterotomy, endoscopic 
nasobiliary drainage (ENBD), endobiliary stent drainage 
with or without sphincterotomy, percutaneous biliary 
drainage, and surgery [22,24,25]. Bile leakage after right 
hepatic duct resection during donor hepatectomy that 
does not improve with conservative care can be treated 
initially by endoscopic methods. Endoscopic treatment 
can reduce the bile duct-duodenal pressure gradient, 
bridge the defect at the leak site, divert bile away from 
the leak site, and prevent stricture formation during 
healing [25]. ENBD can provide visual confirmation of 
biliary healing using repeat cholangiography and can 
be easily removed. Therefore, temporary use of ENBD

is a safe and feasible method of following up leakage in 
patients with minor biliary leakage during a relatively 
short admission period. However, potential drawbacks 
of ENBD include patient discomfort, displacement, 
and electrolyte imbalance, drawbacks not observed fol￾lowing endobiliary stent insertion. Therefore, because 
of possible patient discomfort and the need for longer 
hospitalization, none of the donors in this study under￾went ENBD for leakage. Rather, drainage with endobi￾liary stents was tried in patients who did not improve 
with conservative care. Biliary leakage is a risk factor for 
stricture, or is often associated with stricture [24,26,27]. 
Although prior leakage could not be confirmed in most 
of our patients with stricture, one patient with stricture 
had concomitant biliary leakage. Endobiliary stent in￾sertion during the initial ERC may be more effective 
than ENBD for preventing stricture following leakage, 
as the stent could be maintained in the biliary system 
for a longer time. Several previous studies of endoscop￾ic management of donor biliary complications report￾ed that biliary leakage was treated with ENBD or ERBD 
alone, or ENBD followed by endobiliary stent insertion 
[10,12,21]. The optimal strategy for treating patients with 
biliary leakage has not yet been determined. Moreover, 
these strategies are difficult to compare because the 
number of events in each study was very small. Further 
studies are warranted.
Some patients who failed ERC or did not show im￾provement with ERC were successfully managed with 
percutaneous drainage, suggesting that percutaneous 
transhepatic treatment is effective for treating bile leaks 
when endoscopic treatments have failed or are contra￾indicated [28-30]. Furthermore, percutaneous transhep￾atic biliary drainage (PTBD) was useful for treating long 
lasting combined complications. These include long￾term maintenance of a large-profile catheter (12- to 14-
Fr) through the percutaneous transhepatic tract during 
the indwelling period of the PTBD catheter. In contrast, 
endoscopic treatment requires cannulation of the am￾pulla of Vater during every procedural session, making 
the endoscopic approach more time-consuming and 
difficult.
We also investigated donor factors predictive of bil￾iary complications. Multivariate analysis showed that 
the number of right lobe biliary orifices was associated 
with the development of biliary leakage. In addition, the 
number of biliary orifices was closely associated with 
IHD anatomy. Right lobe donors have been reported to 
be more susceptible to leakage than left lobe donors be￾cause the biliary tract anatomy is more complex in the 
right lobe [7,10,22]. About half of right-lobe grafts have 
multiple biliary orifices [22], whereas left-lobe grafts 
usually have a single orifice. Furthermore, right lobe 
grafts require resection of the right hepatic duct clos￾er to the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts 
than do left hepatic ducts in left lobe grafts because the 
anterior and posterior segmental branches of the right 
hepatic duct often converge just proximal to the bifur￾cation [10,12,22]. Therefore, right lobe donors with larg￾er biliary stumps due to multiple biliary orifices would 
be more susceptible to biliary complications, especially 
leakage, than donors with fewer biliary orifices. 
This study had several limitations, including its ret￾rospective design and the relatively small number of pa￾tients who underwent ERC due to biliary complications. 
However, only about 10% of LDLT donors experience 
biliary complications, with each case representing a dif￾ferent clinical situation. Moreover, most donors with 
biliary complications improve with conservative man￾agement. Therefore, comparative prospective studies 
that include all clinical situations would be very difficult 
to perform. From a practical perspective, the results of 
this study may provide valuable information about the 
actual clinical course of biliary complications in liver 
donors. 
In summary, the present study found that all donors 
with biliary complications were successfully treated us￾ing non-surgical management, and that most donors 
improved with endoscopic endobiliary stent insertion 
without long-term recurrence. These results suggest 
that endoscopic methods are useful and effective as a 
first option for treating right lobe LDLT donors who ex￾perience biliary complications that do not improve with 
conservative management.
