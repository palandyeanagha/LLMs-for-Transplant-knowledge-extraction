Background: Little is known about the efficacy and safety of renal
artery stenting in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis
(ARAS) and impaired renal function.
Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of stent placement
in patients with ARAS and impaired renal function.
Design: Randomized clinical trial. Randomization was centralized
and computer generated, and allocation was assigned by e-mail.
Patients, providers, and persons who assessed outcomes were not
blinded to treatment assignment.
Setting: 10 European medical centers.
Participants: 140 patients with creatinine clearance less than 80
mL/min per 1.73 m2 and ARAS of 50% or greater.
Intervention: Stent placement and medical treatment (64 patients)
or medical treatment only (76 patients). Medical treatment con￾sisted of antihypertensive treatment, a statin, and aspirin.
Measurements: The primary end point was a 20% or greater
decrease in creatinine clearance. Secondary end points included
safety and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Results: Forty-six of 64 patients assigned to stent placement had
the procedure. Ten of the 64 patients (16%) in the stent placement
group and 16 patients (22%) in the medication group reached the
primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.61]).
Serious complications occurred in the stent group, including 2
procedure-related deaths (3%), 1 late death secondary to an in￾fected hematoma, and 1 patient who required dialysis secondary to
cholesterol embolism. The groups did not differ for other secondary
end points.
Limitation: Many patients were falsely identified as having renal
artery stenosis greater than 50% by noninvasive imaging and did
not ultimately require stenting.
Conclusion: Stent placement with medical treatment had no clear
effect on progression of impaired renal function but led to a small
number of significant procedure-related complications. The study
findings favor a conservative approach to patients with ARAS,
focused on cardiovascular risk factor management and avoiding
stenting.

Current guidelines on treatment of atherosclerotic renal
artery stenosis (ARAS) to preserve renal function state
that stent placement is a reasonable treatment strategy for
patients with bilateral disease or a solitary functioning kid￾ney, whereas it may be considered an option for patients
with unilateral stenosis (1). Evidence for the clinical benefit
of renal artery stenting is scarce, and controlled studies do
not support use of this procedure (2, 3).
The natural history of ARAS is characterized by pro￾gression with loss of renal function (4 – 6). Patients with
ARAS are considered high risk because their absolute car￾diovascular risk exceeds the need for renal replacement
therapy (7). Impaired renal function in these patients is
assumed to be caused not only by reduced blood flow to
the kidney but also by loss of microvascular renal perfusion
and renal fibrosis (8). These conditions are driven by hy￾pertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smok￾ing. Intervention studies have mainly focused on relieving
the stenosis, which results in stabilization or improvement
of renal function in most patients (3). No studies have
addressed how aggressive medical therapy might affect the
intrarenal component of the disease.
The number of percutaneous renal artery interventions
is increasing rapidly (9, 10). Although there are no con￾trolled trials supporting this strategy, serious morbidity and
death have been reported as complications of stenting (2,
3, 11, 12). We therefore designed a randomized trial to

assess the efficacy and safety of stent placement plus med￾ical management compared with medical treatment alone
in patients with renal impairment and ARAS.
METHODS
Study Design
We performed a randomized trial involving 10 centers
(9 in the Netherlands and 1 in France) in which patients
were randomly assigned to undergo renal artery stent place￾ment combined with medical treatment or medical treat￾ment only. Patients were monitored for 2 years. Data were
collected in each participating center and gathered at the
trial coordination center (University Medical Center Utre￾cht, Utrecht, the Netherlands). The trial was monitored by
an independent data and safety monitoring board. A
planned interim analysis was performed after 70 patients
had been included and followed for 2 years. A statistically
significant between-group difference in the primary end
point was the stopping rule. The study protocol was ap￾proved by the local institutional review board at each par￾ticipating site. Written informed consent was obtained
from each participant.
Participants
We recruited patients from the departments of internal
medicine and nephrology at the participating sites. Eligibility
criteria were impaired renal function, ostial ARAS detected by
various imaging studies, and stable blood pressure.
Impaired renal function was defined as an estimated
creatinine clearance less than 80 mL/min per 1.73 m2 ac￾cording to the Cockcroft and Gault formula, based on the
mean of 2 fasting serum creatinine values measured within
1 month of each other.
Ostial ARAS was defined as a reduction in the luminal
diameter of the renal artery of 50% or more within 1 cm of
the aortic wall in the presence of atherosclerotic changes in
the aorta, detected by computed tomographic angiography,
magnetic resonance angiography, or digital subtraction an￾giography performed as part of routine clinical care by the
patients’ physicians. Unilateral stenosis was defined as uni￾lateral ostial stenosis with either a truncal stenosis or no
stenosis in the contralateral artery. Bilateral ostial stenosis
was defined as ostial stenosis on both sides, unilateral ostial
stenosis with contralateral occlusion, or solitary kidney
with ostial stenosis. All angiograms were evaluated by 2
experienced radiologists at the coordination center.
Participants were required to have blood pressure con￾trolled while receiving a stable medication dosage in the
month before inclusion, if possible without angiotensin￾converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II–receptor
antagonists. The target blood pressure was less than 140/90
mm Hg.
Exclusion criteria were renal size less than 8 cm, renal
artery diameter less than 4 mm, estimated creatinine clear￾ance less than 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2
, diabetes mellitus
with proteinuria (3 g/d), and malignant hypertension.
Details of the protocol are described elsewhere (13).
Randomization
Eligible patients underwent random assignment at
the coordination center. We used a centrally adminis￾tered, computer-generated permuted block randomization
scheme using blocks of 3, stratified according to participat￾ing site and unilateral or bilateral stenosis. We communi￾cated assignments by e-mail and mail to the investigators at
the site, who subsequently informed the patients of their
allocation, initiated medication, and scheduled angiogra￾phy (for those in the stent group) within 2 weeks of ran￾domization. Study personnel were unaware of the per￾muted block size.
Medication Group
Patients assigned to receive medication only were given
treatment for atherosclerotic risk factors. Hypertension was
treated with diuretics, calcium antagonists, -blockers, and
-blockers, followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme in￾hibitors, angiotensin II–receptor antagonists, and increas￾ing doses of diuretics if first-line antihypertensive treat￾ment failed. Target blood pressure was less than 140/90
mm Hg. Patients were given 10 mg of atorvastatin titrated
to 20 mg as tolerated regardless of lipid levels (13); aspirin,
75 to 100 mg/d; and smoking cessation counseling.
Patients could undergo angiography and stent place￾ment if necessary for refractory hypertension (blood
pressure 180/100 mm Hg and mean blood pressure
160/95 mm Hg during 24-hour ambulatory monitoring
while receiving the maximum dose of all classes of antihy￾pertensive agents), malignant hypertension, and pulmo￾nary edema (13).
Context
Renal stents are commonly used to treat renal artery
stenosis.
Contribution
In this randomized trial, medical treatment of renal artery
stenosis was compared with medical treatment plus stent￾ing. Patients who underwent stenting experienced no clear
benefits, and several experienced complications, including
2 procedure-related deaths.
Caution
The study was underpowered to provide a definitive
estimate of efficacy.
Implication
In this sample, stenting of stenosed renal arteries provided
no clear benefit and caused harm, suggesting that patients
with renal artery stenosis should be treated with medical
therapy alone.

Stent Group
Patients in the stent group received the same medical
treatment as patients in the medication group. A Palmaz￾Corinthian IQ/Palmaz-Genesis stent (Johnson & Johnson
Medical, Miami Lakes, Florida) was placed in every ostial
stenosis, according to a standardized protocol (14). Trun￾cal stenoses were treated by balloon angioplasty. Renal ar￾tery interventions were performed by interventional radiol￾ogists with at least 10 years of experience with the
procedures. Technical success was defined as a residual ste￾nosis less than 50%. Patients allocated to stenting began
receiving aspirin, 75 to 100 mg/d, the day before admis￾sion. During follow-up, re-intervention was allowed when
restenosis was suspected on the basis of a 20% or greater
decrease in renal function or if patients had refractory or
malignant hypertension or pulmonary edema. Ostial steno￾ses were treated with stent placement, and truncal and in￾stent stenoses were treated with balloon angioplasty.
Follow-up
Patients were followed up at 1 and 3 months and every
3 months thereafter for 2 years. Fasting serum creatinine
and 3 sitting blood pressures were measured at every visit.
Total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cho￾lesterol, and triglyceride levels were recorded at 1, 3, and 6
months and every 6 months after. All centers were moni￾tored yearly for quality control of the data.
End Points
The primary end point was worsening of renal func￾tion, defined as a 20% or greater decrease in estimated
creatinine clearance compared with baseline, based on 2
repeated measurements. This was the definitive end point
in the medication group. In the stent group, patients who
reached the end point underwent imaging to exclude reste￾nosis of the renal artery. If no restenosis occurred, the end
point was reached. If restenosis had occurred, re￾intervention was performed, and the primary end point
was reached if the reduction in creatinine clearance of 20%
or greater persisted 1 month after re-intervention.
Secondary end points were procedural complications,
changes in blood pressure, incidence of refractory or ma￾lignant hypertension and pulmonary edema, cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality, and total mortality. Complica￾tions were considered periprocedural if they occurred
within 30 days of treatment. Cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality were independently evaluated by the clinical
event committee according to a preexisting protocol (15).
Statistical Analysis
The sample size calculation was based on an expected
reduction in the incidence of progressive renal failure, de￾fined as serum creatinine levels that increased by at least
20% in the previous 12 months, from 50% in the medi￾cation group to 20% in the stent group, with a power of
90% (16). To detect this difference at a significance level of
5%, we needed to recruit 140 patients (13).
Between-group differences in patient characteristics
were evaluated by using chi-square tests for discrete vari￾ables, the t test for continuous variables with normal dis￾tribution, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for variables
that were not normally distributed. A 2-sided P value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Outcomes were compared when patients reached the
primary end point or at 2 years and were analyzed accord￾ing to the intention-to-treat principle. In our primary anal￾ysis, patients who died or who were lost to follow-up were
censored. Because renal failure and death are probably re￾lated, we also compared groups by using a composite out￾come of the trial’s primary end point and death, in which
patients who were lost to follow-up were censored. We
used an estimated Kaplan–Meier survival curve to charac￾terize the cumulative incidence of the primary end point
and the composite outcome of primary end point and
death and used the log-rank test to compare the groups.
Crude hazard ratios (with 95% CIs) comparing the stent
group with the medication group (reference) for each end
point were obtained from Cox proportional hazards regres￾sion models. Log-minus-log plots were used to evaluate the
proportional hazards assumption. No violation was de￾tected. To assess the modifying effect of the type of steno￾sis, the statistical significance of the product term of type of
stenosis and randomization was determined. Because a
considerable proportion of patients in the stent group re￾ceived medical treatment only, we also performed a by￾protocol analysis. All data were analyzed using SPSS, ver￾sion 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).
Role of the Funding Source
The study was funded by the Dutch Kidney Founda￾tion, Bayer, Cordis, and Pfizer. The funders had no role in
the study design, collection, analysis and interpretation of
data, writing of the report, or the decision to submit the
manuscript for publication. However, they approved the
design and organization of the trial.
RESULTS
Patients
Figure 1 shows the study flow. Between June 2000
and December 2005, 140 patients were randomly assigned
to medical treatment only (n  76) or medical treatment
with additional stent placement (n  64) and were fol￾lowed for 2 years. The number of patients in each group
differed slightly because randomization was stratified by
center and type of stenosis.
In the medication group, all patients received the al￾located treatment. In the stent group, a stent was placed in
46 patients, all of whom had residual stenosis less than
20%. Eighteen patients in the stent group did not receive
the assigned treatment after randomization (12 had
ARAS 50% at the time of the procedure, 2 had technical
failure to place the stent, 2 declined stenting, 1 had balloon
angioplasty, and 1 died before the procedure). These pa￾Article Stent Placement for Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis and Impaired Renal Function

tients were analyzed as if they had received the stent
(intention-to-treat).
Patient Characteristics
The groups did not differ in baseline patient charac￾teristics, including renal function, severity and type of renal
artery stenosis, and imaging study used to detect the ste￾nosis (Table 1).
Primary End Point
Sixteen patients (22%) in the medication group and
10 (16%) in the stent group (2 of whom did not receive a
stent at the beginning of the trial) reached the primary end
point (hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.61]) (Table
2). The primary end point was reached in both groups at a
mean of 10 months (SD, 7). Five of the 10 patients in the
stent group had repeated angiography before reaching the
end point (3 had no stenosis, 1 had restenosis treated by
stenting, and 1 had restenosis treated with balloon angio￾plasty). No procedural complications occurred in these pa￾tients, and all had persistence of decline in renal function
(20% decrease in creatinine clearance) 1 month after
repeated angiography. Angiography was not repeated in
the other 5 patients because of concurrent end-stage cancer
(2 patients); end-stage renal disease before re-intervention
(2 patients); and renography demonstrating normal kidney
perfusion, suggesting a patent stent (1). Event-free survival
did not statistically significantly differ between the groups
(log-rank P  0.44) (Figure 2). Type of stenosis (unilateral
or bilateral) was not a statistically significant effect modifier
(P  0.41). The by-protocol analysis comparing the 90
patients who received medical treatment only with the 50
patients who received renal artery intervention plus medi￾cal treatment had the same result (17 [19%] primary
events vs. 9 [18%] primary events; hazard ratio, 0.9 [CI,
0.4 to 2.0]).

Secondary End Points
The groups did not significantly differ in blood pres￾sure control and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
(Table 2) or in the incidence of the composite outcome of
worsening renal function and death (Figure 2). Procedure￾related deaths occurred only in the stent group. Time until
death during follow-up was similar in both groups: a mean
of 12 months (SD, 8) for the medication group and 10
months (SD, 10) for the stent group. Three patients in the
medication group developed therapy-refractory hyperten￾sion; of these patients, 1 did not receive a stent because of a
kidney smaller than 8 cm, 1 did not receive a stent because
of technical failure, and 1 received a stent successfully. One
patient in the medication group had pulmonary edema
combined with a 20% decrease in creatinine clearance.
Complications
Two patients in the stent group died of procedure￾related causes within 30 days after stent placement. In 1 of
the patients, embolization of a perforated renal artery was
required. The patient subsequently developed pulmonary
edema, needed mechanical ventilation, and died of a mas￾sive ischemic stroke 3 days later. The second patient had
perforation of a renal artery branch. The artery was embo￾lized, but despite re-intervention the patient went into hy￾povolemic shock, experienced the acute respiratory distress
syndrome, and died of multiorgan failure after 1 week.
These adverse events occurred at different centers and with
different providers.
The most common complications after stent place￾ment were minor and mainly consisted of hematoma at the
puncture site (11 patients [17%]). In 1 of these patients,
secondary infection in the groin required surgical recon￾struction. The patient thereafter developed end-stage renal
failure, pulmonary edema, and heart failure and died 6
months after the procedure. In 2 other patients, stent
placement was complicated by false aneurysm of the fem￾oral artery. Injury to the kidney or renal artery occurred in
5 patients; however, this was never associated with loss of
renal function and additional intervention was never re￾quired. These complications also occurred at different cen￾ters and with different providers. Minor side effects of
medication were reported in 15 patients in the medication
group and 4 in the stent group.
One patient in the stent group who had repeated an￾giography required permanent dialysis after cholesterol em￾bolism. No stenosis was found in this patient on repeated
angiography, and therefore no intervention was performed.
In another patient, repeated angiography was complicated
by groin hematoma.
Patient Characteristics During Follow-up
The groups did not significantly differ in patient char￾acteristics at the time of reaching the primary end point
or 2-year follow-up (Appendix Table, available at www
.annals.org), except for slightly higher total cholesterol
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the
medication group despite a slightly higher dosage of statin.

DISCUSSION
In patients with impaired renal function and ARAS,
we found no statistically significant difference in progres￾sion of renal failure over 2 years in those treated with
stenting and medication compared with those treated with
medication only. However, the confidence bounds around
our hazard estimate are compatible with both efficacy and
harm, so the finding is inconclusive. A considerable num￾ber of stent-related complications occurred, including 2
procedure-related deaths, 1 death secondary to an infected
hematoma and 1 case of deterioration of renal function
resulting in dialysis, suggesting that renal stenting for
ARAS may cause more harm than benefit in a community
setting.
Revascularization of the renal artery to preserve renal
function is based on the assumption that ischemia contrib￾utes to renal insufficiency and that correction of the steno￾sis and restoration of renal perfusion will stabilize or im￾prove renal function. The ultimate goal is to prevent or
delay the need for renal replacement therapy. Having re￾trieved no results on a MEDLINE PubMed search for tri￾als published from 1990 through 2008 comparing stent
placement with medical treatment for ARAS and impaired
renal function, we believe that ours is the first controlled
trial of whether revascularization can preserve renal func￾tion. Our data show a small benefit on the primary end
point of stent placement compared with medication only
(16% vs. 22%) that was inconclusive given the wide CIs
around the estimate of effect. The fact that renal function
may progress despite successful revascularization underscores
the complex cause of ischemic nephropathy with an impor￾tant intrarenal (parenchymal) component strongly affected by
risk factors for atherosclerosis. These results are in accor￾dance with the preliminary public report of the ASTRAL
(Angioplasty and STent for Renal Artery Lesions) trial
(17), which found no clinically worthwhile benefits associ￾ated with revascularization on any of the outcomes that
were studied. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing
clinical trials evaluating the effects of revascularization on
renal function suggests that several trials of revasculariza￾tion for ARAS are ongoing or recently completed, with
publication of results pending (18, 19).
The number and time frame of deaths were similar in
the 2 groups. Two procedure-related deaths (3%) oc￾curred, even though our interventional radiologists had ex￾tensive experience (more than 10 years) with renal stenting.
Previous intervention studies among patients with ARAS
treated specifically for renal failure have shown 30-day all￾cause mortality rates of 0% to 10% (16, 20 –26). In studies
with a prospective design, the procedure-related mortality
rate was 0% to 3.6%, and the rate of need for dialysis
within 30 days after stent placement was 0% to 4% (16,
20, 23). These proportions are similar to those in our trial.
Our study had a lower rate of primary events than
anticipated, which reduced the power of the trial to detect
a difference between groups. One explanation could be
that cardiovascular risk management has improved in re￾cent years, with the newer antihypertensives and lipid￾lowering drugs that were used in both study groups. Statins
have been shown to reduce proteinuria in patients with
chronic kidney disease (27) and to reduce loss of kidney
function in patients with cardiovascular disease (28).
When we designed our trial 10 years ago, few studies were
available on the natural course of renal function in patients
with ARAS, and those that were available included patients
with renovascular hypertension with generally better renal
function. Schreiber and colleagues (4) demonstrated that
38% of the patients had a 20% deterioration of renal func￾Figure 2. Survival curves for the primary end point (top) and

tion after a mean of 52 months, and Dean and associates
(29) showed progressive renal failure in 46% of patients
after 44 months. The only study at the time in patients
with impaired renal function specifically showed that 55%
of the patients had decreasing renal function (20%) in
the year before intervention (16). In our power calculation,
we therefore considered an event rate of 50% in 2 years for
the medication group. An important implication of this
lower event rate is that a very large sample would need to
be studied to demonstrate a clinically significant difference
with use of the stent, but only a small proportion of pa￾tients would benefit from it at the expense of serious com￾plications and high costs. These considerations reinforce
our impression that although our findings were inconclu￾sive with respect to efficacy, they nevertheless provide valu￾able evidence that the balance between the potential advan￾tages and disadvantages does not favor stent placement.
In terms of blood pressure, studies comparing balloon
angioplasty of the renal artery and medical therapy in pa￾tients with renovascular hypertension have suggested a
small beneficial effect in the intervention group (30, 31).
In our patients with ARAS and renal dysfunction, blood
pressure improved from baseline in both groups. However,
systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ between
the groups, and equal numbers of antihypertensive drugs
were given.
Our study has limitations. First, a considerable num￾ber of patients had stenoses less than 50% at inclusion. In
addition, by randomly assigning patients on the basis of
results of noninvasive diagnostic tests, we introduced the
possibility that patients with false-positive imaging studies
would be enrolled. However, at the time that we designed
our protocol, noninvasive imaging with computed tomo￾graphic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography
were believed to be very reliable. A meta-analysis by Vas￾binder and coworkers (32) demonstrated that both imag￾ing techniques had a high diagnostic performance com￾pared with angiography. Later evidence suggested a lower
accuracy for diagnosing ARAS (33). However, we must
have included some patients who had stenoses of less than
50% in both groups. The dropout rate of 3% (compared
with the planned 10%) must have compensated in part for
the dilution of power. Neither the intention-to-treat anal￾ysis nor the by-protocol analysis demonstrated a beneficial
effect of additional stent placement.
In conclusion, we believe that this is the first trial
comparing stent placement plus medication with medica￾tion only in patients with impaired renal function and
ARAS. We found no statistically significant difference in
progression of renal failure over 2 years in the 2 groups,
although our findings are compatible with both efficacy
and harm and are therefore inconclusive. A considerable
number of stent-related complications occurred, including
2 procedure-related deaths. Thus, our findings favor a con￾servative therapeutic approach to patients with ARAS, fo￾cused on cardiovascular risk factor management without
stenting.

§ Target blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg.
 The systolic and diastolic blood pressures improved in both groups compared with baseline, with use of the same number of antihypertensive drugs. The mean change in
systolic blood pressure was 9.0 mm Hg (P  0.013) in the medication group and 9.5 mm Hg (P  0.021) in the stent group; the mean respective changes in diastolic
blood pressure were 3.9 mm Hg (P  0.011) and 6.9 mm Hg (P  0.001).
