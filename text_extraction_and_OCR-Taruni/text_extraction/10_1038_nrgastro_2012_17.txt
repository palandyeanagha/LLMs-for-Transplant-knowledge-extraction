RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
In patients with minimal hepatic 
encephalopathy (MHE), short-term 
improvements in cognitive function 
following a liver transplantation are 
maintained in the long term, according to 
an Italian research group.
“Very few studies have investigated the 
effect of liver transplantation on cognitive 
disease after more than 2–3 years from 
the surgery,” explains lead author Katia 
Mattarozzi (University of Bologna, Italy). 
“The results of our prior work encouraged 
us to recall patients after 7–10 years.”
The researchers recalled 12 patients 
from their previous study to undergo 
neuropsychological evaluation. These 
results were then compared to the results 
of tests conducted 6–18 months after 
the surgery.
In general, the improvements seen 
shortly after surgery were maintained 
in the long term. Difficulties with 
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Long-term cognitive function improved 
in MHE after liver transplantation
supramodal cognitive functions, which 
were still present in the first study, 
improved after 10 years. Improvements 
in visuospatial short-term memory and 
verbal learning showed some fluctuation. 
However, the authors note that they did 
not compare the findings in patients who 
had MHE with healthy controls, so it is 
difficult to draw firm conclusions.
Although having a liver transplant and 
long-term use of immunosuppressants is a 
serious undertaking, the authors conclude 
that this strategy results in notable long￾term improvements in cognitive function 
in these patients.
