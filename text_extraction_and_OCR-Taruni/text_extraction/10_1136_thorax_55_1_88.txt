Abstract
Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) is a rare clinicopathological
entity that may be associated with common variable immune
deficiency (CVID) and may lead to respiratory failure and death.
Some patients may respond to prolonged corticosteroid treatment.
We hypothesised that, in view of the predominant T cell nature of
LIP, cyclosporin A would be a more appropriate choice of
immunosuppressive agent and report the first case of its successful
use in a woman with LIP associated with CVID.
