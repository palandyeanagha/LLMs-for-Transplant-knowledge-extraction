Abstract
Objective This is a retrospective study for risk assessment of acute kidney injury after allogeneic hema￾topoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT) based on the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria.
Methods Two hundred and eighty-nine consecutive patients who received allo HSCT were studied retro￾spectively to identify the risk factors for AKI according to the AKIN criteria. The incidence of AKI based on
AKIN staging and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression models
treating each AKIN stage as a time-dependent covariate.
Patients We identified a total of 180 patients who developed AKI within 100 days after allo HSCT; AKI
was classified as stage 1 in 88 patients (30.5%), stage 2 in 46 patients (15.9%) and stage 3 in 46 patients
(15.9%).
Results Patients who developed stage 3 AKI had a significantly worse survival compared to those who de￾veloped no AKI or lower stage AKI (HR: 7.6, 95%CI: 4.8-12.1; p<0.001). Multivariate analysis for risks for
developing AKI revealed an episode of sepsis or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and the use of
liposomal amphotericin as a major cause of the severe stage of AKI.
Conclusion On the basis of our analysis, sepsis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and acute GVHD were associated
with severe AKI, and SOS was associated any stage of AKI.

Introduction
The concept of acute renal failure (ARF) has now been
changed to the new paradigm of acute kidney injury
(AKI) (1). The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) re￾cently established evidence-based guidelines for the treat￾ment and prevention of ARF (1). Recognizing the need for a
uniform definition for ARF, the ADQI group also proposed
new definitions, such as the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and
End-stage renal failure classification (RIFLE), and modifica￾tion was subsequently made by the Acute Kidney Injury
Network (AKIN) (2, 3). The utility of these new definitions
has been evaluated mainly in the field of emergency medi￾cine, but few reports are available on AKI associated with
allo HSCT (4). AKI is a common complication early after
allo HSCT (5). Recent reports have shown that AKI results
in poor long-term survival and several risk factors were
identified for developing AKI following allo HSCT (6-8).
However, detailed risk assessment based on each AKIN
stage has not been fully investigated to date. The present
study evaluated the incidence of AKI, as defined by AKIN
staging (9), in patients undergoing allo HSCT. We also per￾formed a retrospective analysis of risk assessment in trans￾１Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Japan, ２Division of Biostatistics, To￾hoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan, ３Nephrologyy Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center,

plant recipients to determine whether each stage of AKI in
an allo HSCT setting can be predicted.
Materials and Methods
The subject sample of this retrospective study was com￾prised of 289 patients who underwent allo HSCT between
August 2004 and December 2009. Preparative therapy was
basically performed according to the primary disease and
type of transplant. Generally, patients with lymphoid malig￾nancy were conditioned using a total body irradiation (TBI)-
containing regimen (12 Gy), including cytarabine at 8 g/m2
and cyclophosphamide (CY) at 120 mg/kg. Conversely, pa￾tients with myeloid malignancy were conditioned using a
non-TBI-containing regimen that included intravenous busul￾fan (BU) at 12.8 mg/kg and CY at 120 mg/kg. Plasma con￾centrations of BU were not monitored. Total lymphoid irra￾diation (TLI) to 7 Gy was included in BU/CY regimens in
cases with mismatched or unrelated transplantation. Non￾myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation was per￾formed using preparative conditioning comprising CY (120
mg/kg) and fludarabine (125 mg/m2
). Cyclosporine (CyA) or
tacrolimus (FK) plus short-term methotrexate were used for
GVHD prophylaxis. FK was used in cases involving either
unrelated or mismatched transplantation (3). Trough level of
blood concentration of >400 ng/mL CyA and >20 ng/mL
FK were defined as toxic levels. The CyA or FK dose was
gradually reduced from day +90 until day +180. Immuno￾suppression was continued in patients who developed
GVHD. Acute and chronic GVHD were diagnosed and
graded according to previously established criteria (10).
Most patients received ursodeoxycholic acid as prophylaxis
for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Tosulfloxacin and flu￾conazol were orally administered 14 days before allo HSCT.
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was administered to prevent
Pneumocystis pneumonia. Cytomegalo virus (CMV) infec￾tion was monitored weekly according to CMV antigenemia.
Positive antigenemia, defined as >1/65,000 cells, was treated
using ganciclovir twice daily until negative CMV antigene￾mia was obtained. Patients switched to foscarnet in case of
poor response to ganciclovir or developing pancytopenia. All
patients underwent a routine screening blood test including
serum creatinine (Cr) at least 3 times per week. In case of
any clinical event, additional blood tests were performed.
Sepsis was defined as body temperature higher than 38.0℃
with positive blood culture. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome
(SOS) was considered to be possible when at least two of
the following conditions occurred concomitantly after trans￾plantation: jaundice (total bilirubin level >2.0 mg/dL), pain￾ful hepatomegaly, and fluid accumulation evidenced by as￾cites or unexplained body weight gain (>5% above base line
weight). Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) was defined as the pres￾ence of sustained macroscopic hematuria more than 10 days
after transplantation in the absence of other conditions such
as ureteral lithiasis, disseminated intravascular coagulation
or multiorgan failure.
Hematopoietic cell Transplantation comorbidity index
(HCT-CI) was scored (11), but the data of diffusing capacity
in respiratory function test was not measured in a number of
cases. Therefore, diffusing capacity was excluded for scor￾ing in this analysis. AKI was defined and classified into 3
categories according to AKIN criteria (Table 1). AKI within
the first 100 days after allo HSCT was defined based on se￾rum Cr. Urine output criteria included in the AKIN defini￾tion was not used as we were unable to obtain accurate re￾cords of urine output from all of the patients (9). eGFR was
calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease for￾mula, as modified by the Japanese Society of Nephrology:
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2
) = 194 × Cr-1.094 × Age-0.287 × 0.739
(if female) (12).
Statistics
Surviving patients were censored on October, 2010. Cate￾gorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. Associa￾tions between several factors and incidence of AKI based on
AKIN stage and OS were evaluated using Cox proportional
hazard regression model. Age, sex, disease, donor, stem cell
source, conditioning regimen were always included in the
models. In addition to these variables, the following factors
were considered as covariates; cycle of chemotherapies be￾fore HSCT, pre-transplant estimated GFR, HCT-CI, TBI
dose, toxic level of calcineurin inhibitors (considered as a
time-dependent covariate: TDC), acute GVHD, use of am￾photericin B (TDC), episode of sepsis (TDC), episode of
TMA (TDC), episode of SOS (TDC), and episode of hemor￾rhagic cystitis (TDC) in analysis of incidence of AKI, and
HCT-CI, use of amphotericin B (TDC), acute GVHD
(TDC), chronic GVHD (TDC), use of amphotericin B
(TDC), episode of sepsis (TDC), disease recurrence (TDC),
and episode of AKI (TDC) in the analysis of OS. Backward
variable selection was used to construct models. Values of p
<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Incidences of
non-relapse death in each AKIN category were calculated
according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and were compared
using log-rank test. All analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.2 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Discussion
We retrospectively reviewed 289 allo HSCT recipients,
and 180 patients (62.2%) eventually developed AKI at a me￾dian time of 41 days (range, 1-100 days) after transplanta￾tion (Table 2). Median age at the time of AKI was 41.5
years (range, 17-66 years) and 111 patients were men
(61%). Median follow-up was for 489 days (range, 2-2,256
days). AKI was classified as stage 1 in 88 patients (46.6%),
stage 2 in 46 patients (24.3%) and stage 3 in 46 patients
(24.3%) according to the AKIN classification. We initially
sought to determine which variables were associated with
the risk of AKI and we especially focused on the risk as￾sessment based on each AKIN stage. As shown in Table 3,
multivariate analyses of risk factors for each AKIN stage
disclosed an episode of SOS as a major cause of any stage
of AKI, which are in line with the recent report of risk

analysis of AKI (5). Sepsis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and acute
GVHD were associated with more severe AKI. While, the
use of amphotericin B and pre-transplant GFR were dropped
in models of severe stage of AKI. Risk analysis was also
performed to estimate overall survival (Table 4). Multivari￾ate analysis revealed that severity of AKI was significantly
associated worse OS; AKIN >stage 1 (HR, 3.71; 95%CI,
2.33-5.89; p<0.001), AKIN >stage 2 (HR, 4.38; 95%CI,

and use of amphotericin B were also significantly associated
worse OS. In view of the cumulative incidence of non-

AKIN stage
relapse death in each AKIN stage (Figure), patients with a
more severe stage were likely to be followed by more early
and late death and causes of death in each stage were sum￾marized in Table 5. Thus, severity of AKI might contribute
to non-relapse death all the way through the transplantation.
Although the precise mechanism by which AKI can contrib￾ute to long-term poor prognosis is not fully understood, the
volume overload, coagulation abnormalities, and cytokine or
immune-mediated organ dysfunction may also account for
decreased long-term survival of patients who developed
AKI (5). Moreover, chronic kidney disease might ensue as a
consequence of previous AKI event (13), therefore, subse￾quent hypertension, proteinuria and increased cardiovascular
disease could be a possible cause of poor long-term out￾come among AKI patients (5). Specifically, in the setting of
allo HSCT, AKI may interfere with dosing of calcineurin in￾hibitors, and may lead to the development of graft-versus
host disease (GVHD) (5).
In conclusion, on the basis of our analysis, sepsis, hemor￾rhagic cystitis, and acute GVHD were associated with severe
AKI, and SOS was associated with any stage of AKI. How￾ever, in view of the retrospective nature of the study and the
relatively small number of patients, further investigation is
necessary to confirm these correlations in analyses of large
patient populations.
