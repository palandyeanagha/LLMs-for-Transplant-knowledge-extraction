ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer related death in the 
world. Biannual surveillance for the disease in patients with cirrhosis and in high 
risk carriers of hepatitis B virus allows early stage cancer detection and treatment 
with good long term outcomes. Liver ultrasonography and serum α fetoprotein 
are the most commonly used surveillance tests. If suspicious results are found on 
the surveillance test, multiphasic computed tomography or magnetic resonance 
imaging should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
If radiologic tests show inconclusive results, liver biopsy or repeat imaging could 
be considered for confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Management of the 
disease is complex. Patients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, and 
the selection of treatment should consider factors such as tumor burden, severity of 
liver dysfunction, medical comorbidities, local expertise, and preference of patients. 
Early stage hepatocellular carcinoma is best managed by curative treatment, which 
includes resection, ablation, or transplantation. Patients with intermediate stage 
disease often receive locoregional treatment. Systemic treatment is reserved for 
patients with advanced disease. Several positive, phase III, randomized controlled 
trials have expanded the systemic treatment options for advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma with promising long term outcomes, especially trials using combination 
treatments, which could also have eventual implications for the treatment of earlier 
stage disease.
Introduction
Over the past decade, considerable advances 
have been made in the surveillance, diagnosis, 
and management of hepatocellular carcinoma.1
Despite decreasing incidence rates of the disease, 
disease specific mortality rates remain high,2
 and 
early diagnosis is vital to improving outcomes.3  4
Surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma is an 
excellent method to detect the disease at an early 
stage.5
 Liver ultrasound and serum α fetoprotein are 
the most commonly used surveillance tests. However, 
their accuracy to detect early stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma is not optimal,6
 and new surveillance tests 
for the disease have been proposed with promising 
initial results.7-9
Improved imaging techniques have made non￾invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma 
highly accurate and reliable, negating the need for 
liver biopsy for histologic confirmation. Biopsies can 
still be taken occasionally because they can confirm 
hepatocellular carcinoma for lesions without any 
characteristic radiologic features. Given the inherent 
risk of tissue biopsy of liver tumors, liquid biopsies 
could soon have a role as an alternative option in the 
non-invasive assessment of tumor biology.10 11
Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma has 
improved substantially in recent years, with the 
most progress made in systemic treatment. An 
unprecedented number of positive phase III, 
randomized controlled trials have paved the way 
for improved outcomes in patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Management of the 
disease, however, is becoming increasingly complex. 
Multiple options of new agents have proven 
therapeutic efficacy, although underlying cirrhosis 
could substantially affect treatment options as well 
as outcome. This review article aims to provide a 
comprehensive and evidence based review of the 
most recent advances in surveillance, diagnosis, and 
treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

carcinoma vary globally and more than 80% of all 
cases occur in low and middle resource countries, 
with particularly high incidence rates in East Asia 
and sub-Saharan Africa.1
 In the United States, age 
adjusted incidence rates of the disease have tripled 
from 1992 to 2010, before plateauing over the past 
few years.12 13 The increased incidence rates are 
likely due to the high prevalence of chronic infection 
of hepatitis C virus in the population cohort born 
between 1945 and 1965 and substantially increasing 
the burden of metabolic syndrome14 15 More recent 
studies in the US have since reported decreasing 
incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma in 
younger and middle aged adults.12 13
Sources and selection criteria
PubMed and Medline databases were queried using 
the search terms HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
liver cancer, diagnosis, management, and treatment 
to find articles published from January 2000 to 
March 2020. References were also identified from 
the American, European, and Asia-Pacific guidelines 
on hepatocellular carcinoma published during 
this period as well as relevant review articles. We 
considered and selected peer reviewed articles 
in the following order of relevance: randomized 
controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta￾analyses, and observational studies published in 
the English language, with additional priority given 
to comparative studies that were most recently 
published.
Surveillance and diagnosis
Surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma
The goal of a surveillance program for hepatocellular 
carcinoma is to diagnose tumors at an early stage in 
high risk patients and provide curative treatments 
that can lead to improved long term outcomes.16 A 
randomized controlled trial of ultrasonography and 
α fetoprotein given every six months to Chinese 
patients with hepatitis B showed a significantly 
lower mortality rate of hepatocellular carcinoma 
in the screened group than in controls, although 
the study has received substantial criticism 
because of limitations in study design.17 Despite 
no trials including patients with cirrhosis,18 many 
observational studies have shown the surveillance 
of hepatocellular carcinoma to be associated with 
statistically significant improvements in early 
tumor detection, receipt of curative treatment, and 
overall survival among patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma.5 19 However, the impact of surveillance 
on patients with cirrhosis appears to be small, 
because a large proportion of patients with cirrhosis 
do not develop hepatocellular carcinoma.19 Further, 
benefits of surveillance must also be weighed against 
potential physical, financial, and psychological 
harms and the potential for overdiagnosis.20
Currently, the American Association for the Study 
of Liver Diseases (AASLD), European Association 
for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and Asian Pacific 
Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) 
recommend surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma 
in patients with cirrhosis and in high risk patients 
with hepatitis B (box 1).21-23 Importantly, although 
eradication of hepatitis C with direct-acting antiviral 
treatments results in a reduced risk of hepatocellular 
carcinoma, patients with cirrhosis still need 
screening.24 AASLD and APASL define high risk 
individuals with hepatitis B as Asian men (age >40 
years) or Asian women (age >50 years), family history 
of hepatocellular carcinoma, and African or African￾American individuals.21 EASL guidelines define 
high risk patients with hepatitis B according to the 
PAGE-B classification (platelet, age, gender, hepatitis 
B), which can be calculated by platelet count, age, 
and sex.25 Patients with cirrhosis secondary to non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease are at a lower risk for 
hepatocellular carcinomathan those patients with 
hepatits C or B virus, but the high prevalence of non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease in the population makes 
this a key risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma 
development. Hepatocellular carcinoma has also 
been observed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease and without cirrhosis, although the 
risk is less than 1%.26-28 Because of the challenges 
of differentiating advanced fibrosis from cirrhosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma screening is now 
recommended for patients with non-invasive testing 
consistent with at least advanced fibrosis.28
A major problem of surveillance of hepatocellular 
carcinoma is its underuse despite its benefit in early 
tumor detection and improved overall survival.29
In clinical practice, identification of cirrhosis in 
patients at risk is also suboptimal, although tools 
such as the Fib-4, APRI (Asparate aminotransferase 
to platelet risk index), and NAFLD (non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease) fibrosis score have recently been 
developed to aid in the identification of patients 
at risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, allowing 
these patients to be referred to hepatologists for 
surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma.30
Liver ultrasonography is a standard surveillance 
test for hepatocellular carcinoma and patients at 
risk are recommended to undergo surveillance 
using ultrasonography, with or without serum α
fetoprotein every six months.21 Ultrasonography 
is more widely available and affordable than other 
imaging technologies, although accuracy of liver 
ultrasonography is limited owing to technical 
factors.31 A recent meta-analysis showed that 
ultrasonography detected hepatocellular carcinoma 
at any stage with 84% sensitivity, but was only 47% 
successful in detecting early stage disease (95% 
confidence interval 33% to 61%).6
 The addition 
of serum α fetoprotein improves the sensitivity of 
surveillance tests to 63% (48% to 75%).6
Considering the limitation of current standard 
surveillance tests, diagnostic imaging studies with 
either contrast enhanced, multiphasic computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) have been proposed as options for surveillance 
tests. Availability, cost, risk of contrast agents, 
radiation, as well as patient tolerance (especially Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

for MRI) are important considerations, which 
will likely limit their use as surveillance. A single 
center, prospective, cohort study in South Korea of 
407 high risk patients with 1100 paired screening 
tests of ultrasonography and MRI showed that 
screening MRI with liver specific contrast resulted in 
a higher detection rate of early stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma (86.5 v 27.9%, P<0.01) and lower false￾positive findings (3.0% v 5.6%, P<0.01) than 
ultrasonography.32 33 A Markov model study showed 
that MRI based surveillance of hepatocellular 
carcinoma can be cost effective in high risk patients.33
Because of the high cost related to MRI based 
surveillance, an abbreviated MRI protocol has been 
proposed with promising initial results comparable 
to full MRI sequence, although this is not yet used in 
routine clinical practice.34 35 CT based surveillance is 
not often considered in clinical practice, owing to the 
potential risks associated with repeated intravenous 
contrast and radiation exposure.36
Among blood based surveillance tests, the 
GALAD score has been most extensively validated 
with excellent performance in detecting early stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma. The score includes three 
tumor markers for the disease (α fetoprotein, α
fetoprotein L3%, des-γ carboxyprothrombin) and 
two demographic risk factors (age and sex).7 8 The 
performance of the GALAD score was validated 
in the US and it was observed to be superior to 
liver ultrasonography for detecting early stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma.37 The GALAD score was 
found to have excellent performance in detection 
of early-stage, NASH associated hepatocellular 
carcinoma.9
Liquid biopsy methods have been gained attention 
for the detection of early stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Liquid biopsy samples include circulating 
tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and extracellular 
vesicles. Liquid biopsies using detection of circulating 
tumor cells specific to hepatocellular carcinoma, 
mutation or methylation of circulating tumor DNA, 
and transcriptomic profiling of extracellular vesicles 
have shown promising initial results for early 
detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.10 11 38 These 
liquid biopsy methods are not currently commercially 
available, but further validation in a phase III study 
could lead to approval in the future.
Diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma
When abnormal results are seen in the surveillance 
images or tumor marker tests, diagnosis of 
hepatocellular carcinoma can be established on 
the basis of characteristic features of arterial phase 
hyperenhancement (APHE) with portal venous or 
delayed phase washout using contrast enhanced 
multiphasic CT or MRI in patients with cirrhosis 
(box 2).21 Alternatively, diagnosis of hepatocellular 
carcinoma can be achieved by histology for lesions 
lacking the characteristic radiological features of the 
disease.21
In the US, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data 
System (LI-RADS) is often used to classify lesions 
larger than 1 cm that are visible on multiphase 
examinations. These lesions are classified into five 
categories based on APHE, size, portal venous or 
delayed washout, threshold growth, and capsule

appearance. LI-RADS 1 and LI-RADS 2 classify lesions 
that are definitely benign and probably benign, 
respectively, and can be monitored under regular 
surveillance. LI-RADS 3 indicates a low probability 
of hepatocellular carcinoma and repeat or alternative 
imaging is recommended after three to six months. 
LI-RADS 4 indicates probable but not definite 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and multidisciplinary 
discussion is recommended with biopsies or repeat 
or alternative imaging within three months. LI-RADS 
5 indicates definite HCC. The EASL guidelines did not 
adopt the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System 
(LI-RADS; box 2). Similar to AASLD guidelines, 
the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma can be 
established for lesions larger than 1 cm with APHE 
and delayed phase washout in multiphasic CT or MRI. 
Contrast enhanced ultrasonography is often used 
as a diagnostic test for hepatocellular carcinoma in 
Europe. APHE and mild washout after 60 seconds on 
contrast enhanced ultrasonography are a diagnostic 
test for hepatocellular carcinoma with a sensitivity of 
62% and specificity of 99%.39 The EASL and APASL 
guidelines recommend use of contrast enhanced 
ultrasonography as a diagnostic imaging test if 
initial contrast enhanced multiphasic CT or MRI 
show indeterminate findings.22 The AASLD guideline 
indicates that prospective studies in US populations 
are needed to independently verify these results to 
assess the role of contrast enhanced ultrasonography 
in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.21
Finally, the EASL guidelines recommend a biopsy is 
taken for all indeterminate lesions regardless of pre￾test probabilities.22
Treatment
Over the past three decades, the outcome of patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma has substantially 
improved, although these improvements remain 
limited not only by tumor outcomes but also by 
underlying liver disease.40 41 Better outcomes in 
hepatocellular carcinoma can be attributed to earlier 
detection as a result of the wider implementation of 
surveillance programs, better selection of appropriate 
treatments, advances in effective treatments, and 
better management of underlying liver disease.1
Key prognostic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma 
include tumor size and number; serum α fetoprotein; 
histologic grade; microvascular or macrovascular 
invasion and metastasis; and mixed hepatocellular 
and cholangiocellular phenotype (which appears to 
be increasing in the US), although this information is 
not always available at the onset of treatment given 
the reliance on imaging to establish a diagnosis.4 42
Selection of treatment for hepatocellular 
carcinoma requires a complex decision making 
process that considers factors such as tumor burden, 
severity of liver dysfunction, medical comorbidities, 
and patients’ preferences. As shown in figure 1, the 
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system 
takes into account both the tumor related factors 
and the severity of liver disease system that provides 
five distinct stages of hepatocellular carcinoma with 
different prognosis and guidance in the selection of 
treatment.22
• BCLC 0: very early stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma, defined as one nodule of up to 2 
cm in diameter, preserved liver function, and 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status 0. 
• BCLC A: early stage hepatocellular carcinoma, 
defined as one or up to three nodules of up to 
3 cm in diameter, preserved liver function, and 
ECOG performance status 0. 
• BCLC B: intermediate stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma, defined as multinodular beyond 
early stage, preserved liver function, and 
ECOG performance status 0. This group is 
heterogeneous and can be further subclassified.

dysfunction and portal hypertension are central 
determinants of resectability. The lack of a uniformly 
applied definition of resectability is a limitation to 
interpreting reported outcomes. Generally, however, 
resection is considered for patients with one to three 
unilobar lesions; without radiographic evidence of 
macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis; 
and with minimal or no portal hypertension, in 
the absence of synthetic dysfunction. Multiple 
randomized controlled trials and at least two 
systematic reviews have compared the outcome 
for resection versus radiofrequency ablation or 
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and have 
shown improved or similar rates of overall and 
recurrence free survival for patients undergoing 
resection.46-54 The randomized trials to date have 
included patients undergoing open resection, and 
have generally shown slightly higher complication 
rates for resection than for radiofrequency ablation. 
Laparoscopic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma 
offers similar survival to open resection, with a 
reduced length of stay and a reduced perioperative 
complication rate based on propensity score matched 
analyses.55-58
Portal vein tumor thrombus is considered 
advanced disease, and is typically managed with 
systemic treatment rather than resection or ablation. 
However, an analysis of Japanese national registry 
data showed the efficacy of resection in patients with 
branch portal vein tumor thrombus compared with a 
matched cohort of patients who underwent a range of 
other treatments (median survival 2.45 years (95% 
confidence interval 2.15 to 2.67) v 1.57 years (1.43 
to 1.72); P<0.001).59 A systematic review of resection 
versus alternative treatments for hepatocellular 
carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus 
including seven comparative studies found improved 
overall survival for patients undergoing resection.60
A role for the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy 
has also been suggested as a selection tool for 
patients likely to benefit from resection in the setting 
of portal vein tumor thrombus, which might have 
increased relevance with improved efficacy of the 
newer systemic treatment.61
To date, the benefit of adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
systemic treatment in the setting of resection or 
radiofrequency ablation has not been established. In 
the STORM randomized controlled trial, researchers 
found no difference in survival for those who received 
sorafenib versus for placebo (median survival 33.3 
v 33.7 months) in the adjuvant setting for patients 
with a complete radiologic response following 
resection or radiofrequency ablation.62 Newer 
approved systemic treatments such lenvatinib, 
cabozantinib, regorafenib, or novel immunotherapy 
agents such as nivolumab or atezolizumab all have 
efficacy against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, 
and investigation into the role of these agents in the 
adjuvant setting is ongoing (table 1). Another novel 
strategy that is still lacking in comparative studies 
to date, is the use of transarterial radioembolization 
(TARE) before resection to improve resectability by 
reducing tumor size and inducing hypertrophy of the 
functional liver remnant.63 64
Liver transplantation
An important limitation to either resection or ablative 
strategies is tumor recurrence, which occurs in more 
than 60% of patients at five years.49 52 Additionally, 
many patients are not eligible for resection at 
presentation owing to advanced underlying 
liver disease. Liver transplantation is an optimal 
treatment option for early stage, unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis 
because it treats the underlying cirrhosis as well as 
hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with a 
significantly reduced incidence of recurrent cancer 
compared with alternative treatment strategies. Liver 
transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma within 
the Milan criteria (one lesion between 3 and 5 cm, or 
two to three lesions between 1 and 3 cm) has been 
long established as the standard criteria for patient 
selection.65 Based on the success of the Milan criteria, 
additional proposals to allow access for patients 
with larger tumors have been developed. The most 
well known of these are the University of California, 
San Francisco (UCSF) criteria (81% survival at five 
years), up-to-seven criteria (71% survival at five 
years), total tumor volume (75% survival at four 
years), extended Toronto criteria (68% survival at 
five years), and Kyoto criteria (65% survival at five 
years).66-70 Each proposal expands the selection 
criteria, allowing more patients to be considered for 
liver transplantation, while showing reduced but 
excellent long term outcomes after transplantation.
The primary limitation of liver transplantation 
for hepatocellular carcinoma is the critical shortage 
of available liver allografts, and thus the patient’s 
survival without timely access to transplantation as 
well as the expected survival after transplantation 
must be considered, which is best estimated 
by disease burden. In the US, patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma, with α fetoprotein lower 
than 1000 ng/mL, and who are either within Milan 
criteria or downstaged to within Milan criteria from 
specific downstaging criteria (up to five lesions, sum 
of lesion diameters <8 cm) are eligible to receive 
additional waitlist priority after a six month waiting 
period.71 72 Since May 2019, patients receive a fixed 
score 3 points lower than the median MELD (model 
for end-stage liver disease) at transplant (MMaT-3) for 
the area of distribution where they are listed, which 
is currently based on a concentric circle model.72
The primary goal of MMaT-3 is to assign a score 
that is adjusted according to the score required 
to access transplantation in the area where the 
patient is listed, given the differences around the 
US in access to transplantation. A secondary goal 
is to manage the observed and continued rise in the 
MELD score at transplantation over the past decade, 
which is thought to be potentially related to the 
prior system of stepwise increases in the exception

transplantation.73 In the United Kingdom, a benefit 
model was adopted in 2018, which prioritises urgent 
cases and those with the highest anticipated benefit 
from liver transplantation by combining multiple 
donor and recipient parameters, including the 
recipient’s diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.74
The Euro-transplant and Italian systems both use 
MELD based approach with additional exception 
points awarded for hepatocellular carcinoma, while 
the French system incorporates α fetoprotein and 
requires hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.74
Patients waiting for liver transplantation are at risk of 
disease progression, and many types of neoadjuvant 
liver directed treatments such as TACE, TARE, 
radiofrequency ablation, and stereotactic body 
radiation therapy (SBRT) have been used to reduce 
the risk of patients dropping out of the waiting list. 
However, problems such as whether the treatment 
was used to downstage or prevent progression, 
the highly variable waiting time, and the lack of a 
comparative group confound interpretation. Based 
on the available evidence, one treatment cannot be 
recommended over another.75 The main benefit of 
TACE is the ability to treat multiple lesions and lack 
of needle track seeding, while TARE might require 
fewer treatments and no hospital admission. The 
benefits of radiotherapy are currently being assessed 
in ongoing studies.
Living donor liver transplantation is also an 
option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 
which has continued to flourish around the world, 
most notably in Asia. But growth of the procedure 
has been slow in the US for both patients with 
and without hepatocellular carcinoma, in part 
due to donor safety concerns.76 77 Initial concern 
of an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma 
recurrence after living donor liver transplantation 
has since been determined to be primarily related to 
patient selection, and improved survival after living 
donor liver transplantation compared with deceased 
donor liver transplantation has been reported when 
analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, due to a 
reduced risk of patients dropping out of the waiting 
list.78-80 Owing to the ongoing critical organ shortage 
and recent allocation changes, living donor liver 
transplantation is currently increasing in the US 
for both patients with and without hepatocellular 
carcinoma.81
Ablation
Ablation is highly efficacious for tumors up to 3 cm 
in diameter, but its efficacy decreases once tumors 
are larger than 3 cm. Many treatment modalities 
are available for the local ablation of hepatocellular 
carcinoma with generally similar outcomes.82-86
Radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation 
are the most commonly used ablation treatments. 
A recent, multicenter, single blinded, phase II 
randomized controlled trial enrolled 76 patients 
for radiofrequency ablation and 76 patients for 
microwave ablation; patients each had a maximum 
of three hepatocellular carcinoma lesions of up to 4 
cm each. The study showed an association between 
microwave ablation and higher rates of local tumor 
control (relative ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 
0.7 to 3.9).84 However, another randomized trial 
of 93 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
receiving microwave ablation or radiofrequency 
ablation showed no difference in treatment related 
morbidity, overall survival, or disease free survival,

although procedure time was shorter with microwave 
ablation.85
Percutaneous ethanol ablation induces tumor cell 
death via intracellular dehydration and activation 
of coagulation cascades. Local tumor control is not 
as effective as other local ablation modalities. Thus, 
it is currently rarely used.87 However, percutaneous 
ethanol ablation is still being used for the ablation 
of tumors adjacent to major vessels or the bile duct 
to avoid thermal injury, and is still used in countries 
with limited medical resources, because it is 
relatively inexpensive to perform.1
 Cryoablation is an 
alternative ablation treatment that provides a clearly 
distinguishable ablative margin via ice ball formation 
and prevents injury to peritumoral tissues. Thus, it 
is an excellent local ablative approach for tumors 
adjacent to the bile ducts or major vessels with a 
lower risk of peritumoral vascular thrombosis.88
Transarterial chemoembolization
TACE is the most commonly used treatment for 
hepatocellular carcinoma.89 It acts by delivering 
cytotoxic chemotherapy directly into the tumor 
and blocking tumor feeding arteries via embolizing 
particles causing intratumoral ischemia. TACE 
is a standard treatment for intermediate stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma.90 91 Whether the 
survival benefit of TACE is mediated by embolic or 
chemotherapeutic effects is not yet known, and no 
phase III randomized controlled trials are currently 
investigating this question. However, a smaller, 
phase II randomized controlled trial has reported that 
TACE is not superior to embolization alone and that 
the chemotherapeutic component of TACE might not 
be necessary.92 A meta-analysis of six trials including 
676 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma showed 
that TACE was equivalent to bland embolization 
alone over three years of follow-up (hazard ratio 
0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.27), with 
lower levels of postembolization syndrome noted 
with bland embolization.93
While TACE is the first line treatment option for 
intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma, it is 
also an effective treatment option in patients with 
early stage disease who are not suitable candidates 
for surgical treatment or ablation due to the location 
of the tumor, or as a bridge for those awaiting liver 
transplantation.94 Repeat TACE treatments can be 
an effective option for local tumor recurrence or 
progression.95 However, patients might develop 
TACE refractory tumor progression, which is defined 
by either uptrending tumor markers despite TACE 
treatment or lack of local tumor control despite 
two consecutive TACE treatments. In these cases, 
systemic treatment should be considered.96
Transarterial radioembolization
TARE is another form of locoregional treatment for 
various stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.97 TARE 
delivers radioactive microspheres loaded with β
emitting yttrium 90 isotope into the tumor, leading 
to local tumor destruction. No phase III randomized 
controlled trials have shown the survival benefit of 
TARE compared with alternative treatment. Still, 
many retrospective and prospective cohort studies as 
well as a small randomized controlled trial and meta￾analysis have shown that TARE is as effective as TACE 
in improving the overall survival of patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma. TARE might be superior to 
TACE for local tumor control. TARE can be performed 
as an outpatient procedure not requiring overnight 
observation, which is typically necessary for TACE. 
However, patients do require a planning or mapping 
angiogram and 99mTc-MAA scans (technetium 
99mTc macroaggregated albumin) to determine the 
lung shunt fraction as well as a yttrium 90 dose, 
typically a few weeks before the treatment. However, 
two single center studies have shown the safety of 
same day TARE without a planning angiogram.98 99
TARE can be used for early stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma as a bridging treatment to prevent tumor 
progression in patients on the liver transplantation 
waiting list. Radiation segmentectomy with a target 
dose of greater than 190 Gy has been shown to provide 
excellent tumor control and survival outcomes 
comparable to treatments with curative intent for 
early stage hepatocellular carcinoma.100 TARE can 
also provide radiation lobectomy to achieve remnant 
liver hypertrophy while providing tumor control 
before lobectomy or tri-segmentectomy in patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma but an inadequate 
predicted volume of future liver remnant, which can 
lead to safe resection and favorable postoperative 
outcomes.101 102
Stereotactic body radiation therapy
SBRT is another effective treatment option for 
hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a highly conformal 
technique using external beam radiation therapy 
delivered in high doses to the tumor in a small 
number of fractions. Multiple studies have shown 
that SBRT is as effective as local ablation for early 
stage hepatocellular carcinoma and has similar 
efficacy to TACE for intermediate stage disease.103-107
A small, open label, phase II randomized controlled 
trial showed that SBRT in combination with TACE 
was superior to sorafenib in improving the survival of 
patients with advanced stage disease.108 While SBRT 
is not currently considered as a first line treatment 
option for hepatocellular carcinoma, it could be a 
promising alternative treatment, especially when 
primary treatment modalities are not feasible.
Systemic treatment
After multiple, negative, chemotherapeutic trials 
on hepatocellular carcinoma over several decades, 
sorafenib was developed as a multikinase inhibitor 
targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 
1, 2, and 3; platelet derived growth factor receptor β; 
and the Raf family kinases (table 2). Sorafenib was 
proven to prolong survival in two large, phase III 
randomized controlled trials, and was approved by 
the US Food and Drug Administration as a first line 
treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

in 2007.109 110 After the approval of sorafenib, 
multiple trials studying novel targeted treatments 
failed to show superiority or non-inferiority over 
sorafenib.118-120 However, starting with lenvatinib, 
a multikinase inhibitor, the development of new 
treatments has shown considerable progress. In 
2018, levanitib was shown to be non-inferior to 
sorafenib in a large phase III randomized controlled 
trial (REFLECT) for patients with Child-Pugh A and 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.111 Median 
overall survival was 13.6 for the lenvatinib arm 
versus 12.3 months for the sorafenib arm (hazard 
ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.06). 
Most common grade 3-4 side effects of lenvatinib 
were hypertension (23%) and weight loss (8%).
Several agents have also recently been approved 
as second line treatments for patients whose disease 
progressed or who were intolerant of sorafenib.113-115
Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor and it 
is the first second line treatment approved for 
hepatocellular carcinoma based on a double blind, 
placebo controlled, phase III randomised controlled 
trial done in 21 countries with patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma randomly assigned (2:1) 
to oral regorafenib or placebo.113 Treatment with 
regorafenib improved overall survival with a hazard 
ratio of 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.79). 
The most common treatment-emergent events of 
grades 3 or 4 were hypertension (15%), hand-foot 
skin reaction (13%), and fatigue (9%).
Shortly after the approval of regorafenib, 
the CELESTIAL trial showed that cabozantinib 
treatment resulted in an improvement in median 
overall survival compared with placebo in patients 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who 
had previously received sorafenib (Hazard ratio 
0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.92).114
Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases 
(including MET, AXL, and vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) receptors). Unlike other oral 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cabozantinib uniquely 
targets MET whose overexpression confers sorafenib 
resistance.121 122 Side effect profiles were similar to 
other oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
A phase III, randomized controlled trial done 
at 92 medical centers in 20 countries, showed 
that ramucirumab is also effective in prolonging 
overall survival in patients with advanced stage

0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.95).115
Ramucirumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 
monoclonal antibody that inhibits ligand activation 
of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The most common 
grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent events were liver 
injury (16%), hypertension (13%), and bleeding 
(6%).
Over the past several years, immunotherapy, which 
attempts to restore the immune system’s normal 
antitumor response, has also shown promising efficacy 
for advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma.116
Nivolumab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody 
that disrupts programmed cell death protein-1 (PD￾1) immune checkpoint signaling and thereby restores 
the antitumor activity of effector T cells. In a global, 
single arm phase I/II study of nivolumab in 262 
patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, 
results showed an objective response rate of 20% 
(95% confidence interval 15% to 26%) in patients 
treated with nivolumab (3 mg/kg) in the dose 
expansion phase and 15% (6% to 28%) in the dose 
escalation phase.116 Safety profiles were acceptable 
with no drug related adverse events of grade 3-4 
that were reported more than 5% of patients in the 
dose expansion phase. Based on the promising result 
from this global trial,116 the FDA granted accelerated 
approval to nivolumab as a second line treatment for 
hepatocellular carcinoma. After approval as a second 
line treatment, another trial compared the efficacy of 
nivolumab versus sorafenib as a first line treatment 
for advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma.123 This 
phase III trial randomized 726 patients to nivolumab 
and sorafenib at a 1:1 ratio. Median survival was 
16.4 months for patients who received nivolumab 
and 14.7 months for those who received sorafenib, 
which was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 
0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.02).
Pembrolizumab is another anti-PD-1 monoclonal 
antibody used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. In 
a non-randomized, multicenter, open label, single 
arm phase II trial, pembrolizumab was given to 
104 patients with advanced stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma who had previously been treated with 
sorafenib and showed an objective response rate 
of 17%.117 The most common treatment-emergent 
events of grade 3-4 was liver injury (7%). Based 
on these promising preliminary results, the FDA 
granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab as a 
second line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
However, pembrolizumab failed to show a survival 
benefit in a large, phase III randomized controlled 
trial of 413 patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma who had radiographic progression on or 
intolerance to sorafenib.124 The negative result of 
these two phase III trials123 124 highlight that careful 
study design is key for successful phase III trials with 
immunotherapy, and that combination treatment 
might be needed.
An example of one such combination treatment 
was examined in the IMbrave150 study, a phase III, 
open label, randomized controlled trial that showed 
the effectiveness of the combination of atezolizumab 
and bevacizumab over sorafenib in patients with 
advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma.112
Inhibition of VEGF signaling by bevacizumab has 
an immune moderating effect, including dendritic 
cell maturation, T cell function, and reversal of 
immunosuppression, thus combining VEGF inhibitors 
with immune checkpoint inhibitors could have a 
synergistic antitumor effect.125 126 The IMbrave150 
study enrolled 501 patients with advanced stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received prior 
systemic treatment and randomized them at a 2:1 
ratio to receive either atezolizumab and bevacizumab 
combined or sorafenib. Median overall survival was 
over 17 months for the combination treatment versus 
13.2 months for sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% 
confidence interval 0.42 to 0.79). The combination 
treatment was well tolerated and the most common 
grade 3-4 adverse event was hypertension (15%), 
but other adverse events occurred more infrequently 
(<5% of patients). The FDA approved the combination 
treatment of atezolizumb and bevacizumab as a 
first line treatment for advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma in May 2020.
Questions remain unanswered regarding the 
management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Although multiple combination treatments have 
shown promising results, the role of newer treatment 
regimens in patients of Child-Pugh class B remains 
largely unknown, because few of these patients are 
enrolled in trials to avoid competing risk of death from 
liver dysfunction. A small, retrospective, single center, 
US study using nivolumab (including 18 patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh class 
B) showed that 94% of patients experienced adverse 
events of at least grade 3, and about 50% reported 
immune related adverse events.127 The median 
overall survival from the time of nivolumab initiation 
was just 5.9 months. The safety of sorafenib has been 
shown in patients with Child-Pugh class B, and it will 
remain a reasonable treatment option until the safety 
of immunotherapy based, combination treatments 
have been established.128
The most promising treatment combinations do 
not show an objective response rate greater than 
50%, yet they have a substantial risk of serious 
treatment related side effects. Thus, the development 
of biomarkers that can predict treatment efficacy 
for hepatocellular carcinoma is an unmet need. A 
predictive biomarker could be identified on the basis 
of the molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular 
carcinoma, or by use of a retrospective ad hoc analysis 
of randomized controlled trials.129 Liquid biopsies 
of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumour DNA, 
or extracellular vesicles could provide a method of 
predicting treatment response.10 11 130 131
The treatment sequence for advanced stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma remains uncertain with the 
combination of atezolizumb and bevacizumab being 
the most likely first line treatment option. Second

the combination of atezolizumb and bevacizumab 
remains unclear, no ongoing phase III trials are 
investigating this question.
Finally, the selection of an appropriate control 
arm will be challenging in any future randomized 
controlled trials investigating the efficacy of novel 
treatment combinations. Until recently, sorafenib 
was used as a control arm in the first line treatment 
and a placebo was used as a control arm in the second 
line treatment setting. This should change given the 
promising options being developed for the first and 
second line treatments for advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma.
Emerging treatment
Earlier phase clinical trials have shown promising 
results with the combination of different subclasses 
of immune checkpoint inhibitors or combinations of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors and oral multikinases 
inhibitors. Many positive trials are anticipated in the 
near future (table 2). One such trial is examining 
the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for 
advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Efficacy 
of the combination was investigated in a multicenter, 
open label trial of 49 patients whose hepatocellular 
carcinoma got progressed while receiving sorafenib 
or who were intolerant to sorafenib.132 The objective 
response rate was 33% (n=16; 95% confidence 
interval 20% to 48%), with four complete responses 
and 12 partial responses with 31% of responses 
lasting at least 24 months. FDA granted accelerated 
approval to the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab for patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma who have been previously treated with 
sorafenib. Combination of pembrolimizumab and 
levantinib showed promising results with an objective 
response rate of 46% with nine months of median 
duration of response and 20 months of median 
overall survival.133 A phase III randomized controlled 
trial is actively enrolling patients with advanced stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received 
previous cancer treatment to test this combination.134
Similarly, another phase III trial is examining an 
oral multikinase inhibitor and a PD-L1 inhibitor 
(cabozantinib and atezolizumab versus sorafenib) 
as a first line treatment for advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma.135 Another phase III trial has completed 
enrollment for patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma, and compared the outcome of patients 
who received a combination of anti-PD-L1 and 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 versus 
sorafenib.136 Finally, the use of systemic treatment in 
early or intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma 
is controversial and is being currently investigated by 
many clinical trials (table 2).
Guidelines
The AASLD, EASL, and APASL guidelines for 
hepatocellular carcinoma were written by experts in 
the field and published within the past three years; 
they are referenced throughout this review where 
appropriate. The most recent AASLD guideline uses 
the GRADE format (grading of recommendations, 
assessment, development, and evaluations) for 
specific questions being investigated by systematic 
reviews, as well as an additional companion guidance 
to discuss questions that did not have adequate 
comparative studies to perform a systematic review, 
whereas the EASL and APASL guidelines use the 
traditional format. Differences in each guideline are 
highlighted in box 1, box 2, and table 2.
Conclusion
Management of hepatocellular carcinoma has 
advanced substantially during the past decade. Figure 
1 summarizes the current approach for surveillance, 
diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. The benefit 
of surveillance has been shown in multiple studies 
but it remains underused. A novel surveillance test 
should be developed to detection of early stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma more accurately. GALAD 
score, liquid biopsy, and abbreviated MRI show 
promising initial results and future studies could 
confirm their use as surveillance tests. All patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma should be reviewed 
at a center where a multidisciplinary team for liver 
cancer exists, because optimal treatment selection 
often requires multidisciplinary discussion. Patients 
with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma should 
receive curative treatment with resection, liver 
transplantation, or ablative treatments depending on 
the clinical scenario. Treatment of intermediate stage 
disease can be controversial, but those patients with 
resectable tumor and no portal hypertension could be 
considered for curative surgical treatment. Patients 
with advanced stage disease should receive systemic 
treatment. A phase III randomized controlled trial 
showed that a combination of atezolizumb and 
bevacizumab is superior to sorafenib in prolonging 
survival of patients with advanced stage disease. 
This combination treatment was approved as a first 
line treatment in May 2020. More positive trials of 
systemic treatments or treatment combinations are 
expected in the next few years. Finally, a predictive 
biomarker needs to be developed for the selection of 
effective treatments for individual patients based on 
tumor biology.
QUESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
• What is the optimal surveillance test for 
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis 
with abdominal obesity or other predictors of 
inadequate quality ultrasonography?
• What is the optimal sequence of treatment in patients 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (eg, first, 
second, or third line treatment)?
• What are the roles of systemic treatment in 
combination with surgical, locoregional, or 
another systemic treatment for early, intermediate, 
or advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma, 
respectively?
• Can liquid biopsy contribute to the early detection of 
cancer and prediction of treatment response?
