Abstract
Background: Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is an inherited disease lacking of hepatic oxalic acid metabolic enzymes
which could lead to irreverisible renal damage. Currently, liver–kidney transplantation is a curative but highly
invasive therapy used to treat patients with PH. However, limited studies have focused on combined liver–kidney
transplantation (CLKT) and sequential liver and kidney transplantation (SLKT) in patients with PH.
Methods: The present study included 201 patients with PH who received both liver and kidney transplants and
who were listed on the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients from 1987 to 2018. According to the liver–kidney
transplant procedure, patients were separated into a CLKT group and a SLKT group. Patient demographics and
transplant outcomes were assessed in each group.

Results: Compared with the SLKT group, The CLKT group got a worse pretransplant dialysis condition in both the
proportion of patients under pretransplant dialysis (p = 0.048) and the duration of the pretransplant dialysis (p <
0.001). The SLKT group got higher human leukocyte antigen mismatch score of kidney donor (p < 0.001) and liver
donor (p = 0.003). The CLKT group utilized higher proportion (98.9%) of organs from a single deceased donor, while
the SLKT group utilized 75.0% of organs from deceased liver donors and only 35.0% of organs from deceased
kidney donors (p < 0.001). Kidney function measured by serum creatinine concentration before liver transplantation
(LT) or CLKT was similar (p = 0.305) between groups. Patient survival was not significantly different between the two
groups (p = 0.717) and liver (p = 0.685) and kidney (p = 0.464) graft outcomes were comparable between the two
groups.
Conclusions: SLKT seems to be an alternative option with strict condition for CLKT, further exploration about the
SLKT is still required.

Background
Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a kind of congenital dis￾order that results from abnormal glyoxylate metabolism
owing to deficiency of hepatic enzymes [1]. However,
symptoms of PH are usually observed in the urinary tract,
and are related to continuous oxalate deposition and irre￾versible renal damage resulting in end-stage kidney dis￾ease (ESKD). In patients with ESKD, a high level of
oxalate production is compounded by a high daily dietary
oxalate intake and impaired oxalate elimination, which
causes a step-by-step increase in plasmatic oxalate and re￾sults in calcium oxalate crystals depositions in extra-renal
tissues and organs, such as the skin, bones, and heart [2].
Systemic oxalosis is observed in the later stage of ESKD
and can be fatal in patient with PH [3]. Patients with type
1 PH (PH1), which is induced by loss of hepatic alanine￾glyoxylate aminotransferase [4] account for the majority
of patients with PH worldwide [5, 6]. Since simple renal
therapies such as dialysis or kidney transplant [1] are not
able to solve oxalate accumulation, more effective strat￾egies are under exploration.
Liver–kidney transplantation (LKT) is proposed because
it could not only rescue hepatic enzyme deficiency, but it
could also replace the dysfunctional kidney, especially in
patients with PH1. Combined liver and kidney transplant￾ation (CLKT) is the mainstream transplant strategy for
LKT procedures, and global centers have confirmed the
feasibility of the procedure with encouraging long-term re￾sults, even in pediatric patients [7, 8]. However, this proced￾ure demands liver and kidney donors, usually a single
deceased donor, which is costly and strict owing to organ
shortages [9]. Sequential liver and kidney transplantation
(SLKT) is an alternative strategy that separates the CLKT
procedure into two steps: liver transplant (LT) and kidney
transplant (KT). The application of intensive dialysis after
LT could help the liver graft to mobilize and eliminate the
general oxalate burden before KT, which may improve
renal graft survival outcomes [10, 11]. However, previous
studies pointed out the inferior patient survial in SLKT or
CLKT compared with kidney transplant in children, and
these studies may suggest the the overall high risk of multi￾organ transplantation, even in sequential procedure [8, 12].
There were researchers believed that liver allograft provided
immunoprotection for kidney graft only if both organs are
transplanted simultaneously [13]. But recently, Kumiko
et al. pointed out that the preceding liver allograft could
contribute to the immunological protection, which may
benefit the long term renal allograft outcome in patients
after SLKT from a single donor when compared with kid￾ney transplant alone [9]. However, the details of the SLKT
in specific disease condition like PH, such as the donor￾recipient match condition, the timings of LT and sequential
KT, are still not reach a consensus.
Although different series and registry studies about PH
have been published worldwide, most of them adopted a
single-center design. The limited number of patients in
these cohorts means that the results are not statistically
significant. Little is known about multi-center research
into CLKT and SLKT in patients with PH. Calinescu, A.
M. et al. analyzed all primary pediatric CLKT cases in the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) and
found that CLKT has similar survival outcomes when
compared with isolated LT (including SLKT) and patients
with PH present with worse outcomes than patients with￾out PH [8]. The details in the group of patients with PH
were not mentioned in this study. In this study, we sought
to clarify the differences between CLKT and SLKT in pa￾tients with PH in the SRTR database to involve patients
reported to date as much as possible.

recipients in the U.S.A., submitted by the members of
the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
(OPTN). The Health Resources and Services Adminis￾tration (HRSA), the U.S. Department of Health and Hu￾man Services, provides oversight into the activities of the
OPTN and SRTR contractors. The whole study was
reviewed and approved by the ethics committee at
Zhejiang University, China (No.2019–1022-1).
Study population
PH was defined using specific diagnosis codes (code
4307 in the LT database, code 3013 in the KT database)
or indications of PH specified in the diagnosis text field.
After data integration, only patients from 1987 to 2018
underwent CLKT or SLKT (with prior LT) according to
the time interval between LT and KT. Patients who had
received a multi-visceral transplant or who underwent
re-transplantation were excluded from the study.
Study outcomes
The primary outcomes were post-transplant patient sur￾vival, liver graft survival, and kidney graft survival. Pa￾tient survival was defined as the time from the initial
transplant to patient death or final follow up. Liver graft
survival was defined by the time interval between date of
LT and liver graft failure date, patient death date, or
final follow up date. Kidney graft survival was defined by
the time interval from date of KT to kidney graft dys￾function date, patient death date, or final follow up date.
Either liver or kidney graft dysfunction was defined by a
clear graft failure record or re-transplantation date.
Statistics
Demographic and clinical characteristics of recipients at
initial transplant and liver and kidney donor and graft
characteristics were described using median (interquartile
range [IQR]) and frequency (percentages), respectively.
Continuous and categorical variables of the analyzed
groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test
and chi-squared tests or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
A two-sided α level of < 0.05 indicated statistical signifi￾cance. The Kaplan–Meier method was applied to estimate
the probability of patient survival and graft survival, and
the log-rank test was used to make between-group com￾parisons. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, U.S.A.).
Results
According to our definition, a total of 201 patients from
1987 to 2018 were included in this study; 181 patients
underwent CLKT, while 20 patients underwent SLKT.
The demographic and clinical features of recipients at
initial transplantation are outlined in Table 1. We found
that the pretransplant dialysis condition were significantly
different between groups including pretransplant dialysis
type and dialysis duration. The proportion of patients
under dialysis (including hemodialysis and peritoneal dia￾lysis) was higher in the CLKT group compared with the
SLKT group (87.9% vs. 64.3%, p = 0.048), and the pre￾transplant dialysis duration was also found longer in the
CLKT group than the SLKT group (17.0 months (IQR 7.0,
22.0) vs. 4.0 months (IQR 0.0, 12.3), p < 0.001). There were
no significant differences between the two groups in terms
of age (p = 0.183), body mass index (p = 0.133), gender
(p = 0.651), race (p = 0.378), and serum creatinine concen￾tration (p = 0.312). The median waiting time from the list￾ing date to the initial transplant date was 5.0 (IQR 1.5, 9)
in the CLKT group compared with 2 (IQR 1.0, 7.5) in the
SLKT group (p = 0.094).
Donor and graft characteristics are summarized in
Table 2. For liver donors, the CLKT group used a higher
proportion of deceased donors (98.9%) when compared
with the SLKT group (75.0%; P < 0.001). As for LT pro￾cedure type, the proportion of patients receiving whole
liver graft was higher in the CLKT group compared with
the SLKT group (80.1% vs. 60.0%; P = 0.025). Donor age,
gender, race, and cause of death were similar between
groups. In kidney donors, the donor age was higher in
the CLKT group (median age = 20 years) compared with
the SLKT group (median age = 34 years; p < 0.001). The
CLKT group received organs from deceased donors in a
greater percentage of cases (98.9%) compared with the
SLKT group (35.0%; p < 0.001). Donor gender, race,
serum creatinine concentration, and cause of death were
similar between groups.
Transplant outcomes are listed in Table 3. For liver
outcomes, the incidence of rejection episodes between
transplant and discharge was similar (12.9% in the CLKT
group vs. 12.5% in the SLKT group, p = 0.898). Although
not statistically significant (p = 0.371), no incidences of
liver graft failure were observed in the SLKT group be￾fore discharge, while three patients (3.9%) developed
graft failure in the CLKT group. Discharge laboratory
values also demonstrated comparable outcomes in ala￾nine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alka￾line phosphate, and albumin; while serum creatinine
concentration was significantly different (p = 0.018).
The incidence of rejection in KT between transplant
and discharge was 5% in the CLKT group, while no re￾jection was observed in the SLKT group (p = 0.505). The
incidence of graft failure was 8.3% in the CLKT group
compared with 15% in the SLKT group (p = 0.321). The
serum creatinine concentration at discharge was slightly
lower in the SLKT group, although statistical signifi￾cance was not reached (p = 0.161). The duration of
hospitalization after transplantation in the SLKT group
(median time = 10 days; IQR 5, 21) was much shorter
than in the CLKT group (median time = 19 days, IQR 9,
Xiang et al. BMC Gastroenterology (2020) 20:208 Page 3 of 9

34; p = 0.009). The median interval between LT and KT
was 10.5 months (IQR 6.25, 24.25).
Cumulative 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year patient survival
rates were 89.2, 77.0, and 67.0% in the CLKT group; and
100, 84.1, and 84.1% in the SLKT, respectively (Fig. 1, p =
0.338). Although not statistically significant, the SLKT group
presented with better outcomes. The cumulative 5-year liver
graft survival rate was 86.8% in the CLKT group, and 88.2%
in the SLKT group (Fig. 2, p = 0.685). The cumulative 5-year
kidney graft survival rate was 78.1% in the CLKT group and
85.0% in the SLKT group (Fig. 3, p = 0.464).
Discussion
LKT is the only curable treatment for PH because it solves
both hepatic enzyme disorder and renal dysfunction, in
which the CLKT is a globally implemented LKT procedure
with abundant experience. However, SLKT seems to be a
much more feasible procedure because it divides the LKT
into two steps: LT followed by KT. The application of post￾transplant intensive dialysis could help liver graft to be free
from damage caused by a high degree of system oxalate de￾position. This procedure has succeeded in living donor trans￾plants with encouraging outcomes [14]. Outcomes of LKT
in patients with PH1 have improved over the decades, par￾ticularly in CLKT [15]; however, published data investigating
SLKT is limited.
Some clinicians have highlighted that SLKT suits pa￾tients with long-term renal replace treatment or patients
suffering with systemic oxalosis, while CLKT suits patients
with a short dialysis period or without systemic oxalosis
[14]. Our study demonstrated that the SLKT group had
similar preoperative renal function at LT compared with
the CLKT group, and the long-term outcomes of patient
survival and graft loss were encouraging in the SLKT
group when compared with the CLKT group. The cumu￾lative 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year patient survival rates
were 89.2, 77.0, 67.0% in the CLKT group, and 100, 84.1,
84.1% in the SLKT group. The cumulative 5-year liver
graft survival rate was 86.8% in the CLKT group and
88.2% in the SLKT group, and the cumulative 5-year kid￾ney graft survival rate was 78.1% in the CLKT group and
85.0% in the SLKT group. However, these two groups of
patients seemed to be at a different level of pretransplant
renal condition demonstrated by the higher proportion of
patients under dialysis and longer pretransplant duration
(17.0 months in CLKT (IQR 7.0, 22.0) vs. 4.0 months in
SLKT (IQR 0.0, 12.3), p < 0.001) in the CLKT group com￾pared with the SLKT group. Then we simply compared
pretransplant renal function between 2 groups by serum
creatinine because of lacking of GFR data before LT in
SLKT groups, however, the serum creatinine showed no
significant difference (p = 0.312).

Donor condition should also take into consideration.
Most CLKT procedures included in the present study uti￾lized organs from single deceased donors. For SLKT, one
of the organs is often procured from a living donor and
the other from a deceased donor [16–18]. We also dem￾onstrate this organ allocation preference in our patient’s
demographic statistics analysis: the CLKT group utilized
98.9% of organs from a single deceased donor, while the
SLKT group utilized 75% of livers from deceased donors
and only 35% of kidneys from deceased donors.
Research suggests that liver grafts have a protective effect
on kidney grafts when procured from the same donor and
when transplanted simultaneously, which translates to a
low rate of acute rejection and improved kidney graft sur￾vival when compared with isolated KT or LT [19, 20]. hu￾man leukocyte antigen (HLA) are one the suggested
mechanisms behind the immunoprotective phenomenon
[21, 22]. HLA antigens produced by the transplanted liver
allograft could neutralize circulating alloantibodies. Soluble
HLA antigens delivered by the liver allograft could inhibit
natural killer and cytotoxic T cells. Kupfer cells and biliary
epithelial cells from the liver allograft also demonstrate an
ability to clear circulating antigens [23, 24]. Our study may
support this hypothesis through the observation that the
SLKT group acquired significantly lower mismatch scores
when compared with the CLKT group both in liver grafts
(p = 0.003) and renal grafts (p < 0.001) but reached a com￾parable long-term outcome either in patient survival or
graft loss.
Even though the deficiency in specific hepatic enzymes
could be solved by liver allograft, renal allograft may accu￾mulate oxalate deposits while mobilizing and eliminating
systemic oxalate accumulations [18, 25]. Therefore, SLKT
seems to be more reasonable than CLKT for patients with
severe plasma oxalate accumulation because it decrease
the plasma oxalate level below the saturation level by LT
and intensified dialysis protocol to create a better kidney
graft survival condition before KT. Studies have reported
that patients undergoing SLKT who underwent an early
LT could acquire decreased perioperative morbidity and
therefore more choices for kidney allocation (either a de￾ceased or a living donor) compared with those only under￾going dialysis [26]. However, the optimal interval between
LT and KT is unknown. In 2017 a United Network for
Organ Sharing (UNOS) allocation policy for CLKT was
implemented, which defines the medical eligibility criteria
for CLKT and provides a safety net by assigning priority
for renal allograft allocation to LT recipients with ESKD

within 1 year of LT [27, 28]. In the present study, the me￾dian interval between KT and LT was 10.5 months (IQR
6.25, 24.25) and the long-term outcome somewhat proved
the validity of these allocation policies.
The present study is limited by its retrospective design.
First, the diagnosis of PH is obscure owing to lack of
genetic diagnosis data, so the subtype of PH could not
be analyzed. Second, the details of patient status, such as
oxalate concentration and glomerular filtration rate were
not mentioned; we could only simply assess renal func￾tion using the recipient serum creatinine concentration
and pretransplant dialysis condition. Third, our result
may have overestimated the outcome of SLKT because
the cases we retrieved from the database were with
definite LKT records, making the cases who intended to
receive SLKT but failed by the failure of LT were ex￾cluded. Furthermore, the sample size was relatively
small; a few cases of post-transplant death and graft loss
were recorded, making it hard to identify risk factors
and perform multivariate assessment.
In summary, PH is a rare inherited disease that is asso￾ciated with substantial metabolic disorders and high
mortality if it is not treated effectively, and LKT is crit￾ical for the majority of patients with PH. Our results
may suggest that SLKT could be a viable alternative
treatment to CLKT in specific patients with limited con￾ditions including early LT procedure and appropriate
donor resource. Based on this suggestion, further

exploration about the SLKT such as pretransplant condi￾tion, donor allocation and interval between the trans￾plantations is still required.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the SLKT
seems to be an alternative option with strict condition
for CLKT, further exploration about the SLKT is still
required.
