Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disorder that
arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental
risk factors. We report the findings of a genome-wide
association study of T1D, combined in a meta-analysis with
two previously published studies. The total sample set included
7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. Forty-one distinct
genomic locations provided evidence for association with T1D
in the meta-analysis (P o 106). After excluding previously
reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an
independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319
affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Of these, 18 regions were
replicated (P o 0.01; overall P o 5  108) and 4 additional
regions provided nominal evidence of replication (P o 0.05).
The many new candidate genes suggested by these results
include IL10, IL19, IL20, GLIS3, CD69 and IL27.
Results from linkage and association studies in T1D have long
supported a model in which the major risk factor for T1D resides
in the HLA region on chromosome 6p21. Candidate gene studies
carried out over a number of years identified four non-HLA T1D risk
loci: INS, CTLA4, PTPN22 and IL2RA1–4. Recently, the application of
genome-wide SNP typing technology to large sample sets and
comparisons with results from other immune-mediated diseases
have provided convincing support for 19 additional T1D-associated
loci5–13, all with allelic odds ratios (ORs) of less than 1.3.
In order to have adequate power to detect additional T1D risk loci
with ORs in the range of 1.1 to 1.3, we carried out a new genome-wide
association scan using British cases and controls and used this dataset
in a meta-analysis that included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference
samples (Table 1). The other datasets included in the meta-analysis
were from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC)
study7 and a study12 that used T1D cases from the Genetics of Kidneys
in Diabetes (GoKinD) study of diabetic nephropathy14 and reference
samples from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) study15.
The two earlier studies (WTCCC and GoKinD/NIMH) used
Affymetrix 500K platforms, whereas for our study (T1DGC), we
used the Illumina 550K platform. Of the 841,622 SNPs genotyped
in these studies that had minor allele frequencies (MAF) exceeding 1%
and passed our quality control standards, 328,044 were genotyped
only by the Affymetrix platform, 437,739 only by the Illumina plat￾form, and 75,839 were genotyped by both platforms. As only 9% of
SNPs are shared between these platforms, we used imputation to
combine results across studies. To develop imputation rules, we took
advantage of the fact that 1,422 of the original WTCCC controls that
were included in the T1DGC study had been genotyped on both
platforms (Methods).
An analysis using Mantel’s extension to the 1 degree-of-freedom
(1-d.f.) Cochran-Armitage trend test that combined comparisons over
the three studies yielded 41 distinct genomic locations with P values
o10–6 (Fig. 1; individual plots for each study are in Supplementary
Fig. 1 online). Fifteen of these sites were in regions where there have
been previous reports of association with T1D (Table 2). The remain￾ing 26 of these locations, along with one weaker association on the X
chromosome, were chosen for further analysis. To address the possible
effects of population structure, we stratified the analyses by geogra￾phical region in the case of the British studies and by a ‘propensity
score’ based on principal components analysis on the US study. This
was only partially successful in reducing the overdispersion of test
statistics, a large part of which derived from the US data (Table 3). If
the residual overdispersion was due to population structure, there
would be a strong case for correcting the P values (as shown in
Table 3). However, the modest effect of the stratified analysis on

overdispersion, taken together with the absence of any overdispersion
in case-only interaction tests (see below), suggests that it is more likely
due to differential genotyping errors. In this case, correction of the
most significant P values would be overconservative because we have
carefully checked all genotyping cluster plots for associated SNPs. The
genomic control–corrected P values are nevertheless shown in Supple￾mentary Table 1 online. The strongest associations tended to become
somewhat less significant, but the choice of regions for follow-up,
based on the criteria of P o 106
, was not affected. We also carried
out, for SNPs with MAF410%, 2-d.f. ‘genotype’ tests that would be
more sensitive to associations showing marked dominance (deviation
from an additive model, on the log scale). Significance was notably
increased, by 3–4 orders of magnitude, at three SNPs, but was less
significant than the corresponding 1-d.f. tests otherwise (Supplemen￾tary Table 1), yielding no additional findings at P o 10–6
. The results
of stratified 1-d.f. tests of these SNPs, separated by study, are shown in
Supplementary Table 2 online. Quantile-quantile plots for tests in our
T1DGC study and in the meta-analysis, after removal of tests for SNPs
in linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions surrounding known and
putative associations, are shown in Supplementary Figure 2a,b online.
The SNPs showing the most significant associations with T1D from
each of the 27 newly identified regions selected for replication were
genotyped in a further 4,267 cases and 4,670 controls and in 4,342 trios
from 2,319 T1DGC families with multiple affected offspring. Genotype
data passed design and quality control criteria for 25 of these SNPs.
Eighteen regions replicated with P o 0.01 and showed genome-wide
significant (P o 5  108
) association in the joint analysis of the
genome scans and replication samples (Table 4, individual scan data in
Supplementary Table 2). A further three of the remaining seven SNPs
also showed P o 0.01 in the replication studies, and a fourth had P o
0.05, but these failed to reach overall P o 5  108 (Table 4). This
study, therefore, adds 18 T1D risk loci to the
existing 24 and provides suggestive support
for four more. As expected, nearly all of these
loci have OR o 1.2, as larger effects would
likely have been discovered in earlier studies.
Two of the new associations (10q23 and
16q23) contradict this trend and highlight
the disparity between genomic coverage of
the older Affymetrix 500K chip and the
newer Illumina 550K: these loci do not have
good proxies on the Affymetrix chip, explain￾ing why they were not previously identified
despite relatively large effect sizes (OR B 1.3).
The families used for replication were
derived from affected sib-pair linkage studies.
One consequence of ascertainment on the
basis of at least two affected siblings was a
high frequency of high-risk HLA genotypes16.
It has been reported that relative risks for several non-HLA loci are
reduced in subjects carrying high-risk HLA genotypes17,18, reflecting
deviation from a multiplicative model for joint effects, and this would
lead us to expect reduced effect sizes in multiple-case families. Indeed,
the results of the replication study were generally less convincing in the
family data than in the case-control data, reflecting smaller effect sizes
in the families. One potential explanation for these different effect
sizes lies in possible statistical interaction among risk loci, leading to a
less-than-multiplicative accumulation of risk in samples (such as those
from multiplex families) with a large number of risk variants. This
hypothesis is difficult to test because power to detect interaction terms
is much less than that to find equivalent-sized main effects and is
doubly compounded when specific causal variants (rather than tag
SNPs from a GWA scan) are not known.
We tested for deviation from the model of multiplicative effects with
HLA, on a genome-wide basis, by first calculating predictive risk scores
using SNPs in the MHC region on each platform, and testing for
association between this score and every other SNP in the remainder of
the genome. These tests are ‘case-only’ tests for statistical interaction
reflecting variation of allelic relative risks with the level of HLA￾attributable risk. As noted earlier, these test statistics did not show
the overdispersion that would have been indicative of population
stratification (Supplementary Fig. 2c). However, the subset of these
tests concerning established T1D susceptibility loci tended to have
larger w2 values than expected by chance (Supplementary Fig. 2d). In
most cases (31/45), the interaction tests took the opposite sign from
the main effect test, consistent with high MHC risk leading to lower
risk for other loci. Of the five interactions that reached P o 0.05, four
were of this type (loci near 2q24.2, IFIH1; 1p13.2, PTPN22; 17p13.1
and 2q33.2, CTLA4). We carried out a further test by calculating a T1D
risk score using all associated loci excluding the MHC region and

testing, in cases only, for correlation between this score and the MHC
risk score. We found a weak, but significant (P ¼ 0.0007) negative
correlation, again indicating that risk from HLA and non-HLA sources
accumulates at a rate less than expected from the model of multi￾plicative effects, so that there is a general tendency for relative risks for
non-HLA loci to be reduced when HLA-related risk is high.
Several of the 18 regions identified here contain genes of possible
functional relevance to T1D. The region 1q32.1 contains the immuno￾regulatory cytokine genes IL10, IL19 and IL20. The region of strong LD
at 9p24.2 contains only a single gene, GLIS3. Mutations in GLIS3 have
been reported in children from three different consanguineous families
with permanent neonatal diabetes associated with congenital hypothyr￾oidism and other clinical complications19. The region on 12p13.31
harbors a number of immunoregulatory genes including CD69, which
is induced by activation of T cells and functions in thymic egress20.
Several other members of the calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin
(CLEC) domain family with immune functions also map to this
region. Our results suggest several new candidate genes, but further
genotyping, resequencing and functional studies will be required in
order to be more specific as to which genes might be causal.
METHODS
Subjects. The WTCCC study has been described elsewhere7. Cases were
recruited from pediatric and adult diabetes clinics at 150 National Health
Service hospitals across Great Britain as part of the Genetic Resource for
Investigating Diabetes (GRID) collection of the Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation/Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory (JDRF/
WT DIL)9. Half of the controls were drawn from the British 1958 Birth
Cohort21 and half from a group of blood donors recruited by the WTCCC in
collaboration with the UK Blood Services7. The former group was subsequently
genotyped on the Illumina 550K platform and was used as the control group in
the T1DGC study reported here. Because the removal of this group from the
WTCCC study left it somewhat short of controls, we used a group of 1,868
individuals with bipolar disorder for additional reference samples—a group
conspicuous in the WTCCC studies in its lack of significant differences from
control allele frequencies7.
Our study added approximately 2,500 controls from the British 1958 Birth
Cohort to the 1,500 described above, and compared these with a new group of
approximately 4,000 British cases from the JDRF/WT DIL collection. All cases
and controls were from Great Britain. To minimize the effects of population
structure, the case-control comparisons in the WTCCC and T1DGC studies
have been stratified by the 12 regions of Great Britain5,7. Sample exclusions in
the genome-wide studies are discussed in Supplementary Methods online.
Replication studies were carried out in two groups of cases and control as
well as 2,319 affected sib-pair families previously recruited and characterized by
the T1DGC6. The British cases were from the JDRF/WT DIL, and the controls
were drawn from the British 1958 Birth Cohort and the UK Blood Service
controls of the WTCCC. The second set of cases and controls from Denmark
was recruited from a nationwide registry. All cases (49% females) were
diagnosed before age 18 years and the mean age at onset was 9.02 years.
Control subjects were randomly selected from the Inter99 study22.
Genotyping. For the T1DGC study, we selected 4,000 T1D case and 2,500
control DNA samples that had not been previously used in a genome-wide
association study and that migrated as high-molecular-weight bands of
genomic DNA, B23 kb, by electrophoresis on a 0.75% agarose gel. All DNA
samples were extracted using a chloroform-based method and quantified in
triplicate using Picogreen. Once selected, the case and control DNA were
randomized by columns into a 96-well plate format.
For the T1DGC study, genotyping was carried out on the Illumina 550K
Infinium platform, and for comparability, all genotypes were rescored using the
ILLUMINUS algorithm23. The WTCCC study used the Affymetrix GeneChip
Human Mapping 500K Array set, whereas the GoKinD/NIMH study used
genotype data generated with the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array
5.0. The 5.0 array incorporates all of the SNPs on the earlier 500K array but on
a single chip along with an additional 420K nonpolymorphic probes. Details of
the scoring of genotypes may be found in the original publications7,12. The
criteria for discarding some SNPs from the analysis are discussed in Supple￾mentary Methods.
For the replication studies, genotyping was carried out in a fully blinded
fashion using Taqman assays as previously described9.
Statistical methods. The 1-d.f. tests are Cochran-Armitage tests for trend
alternatives, extended to pool information across multiple studies or across
multiple strata within a single study by the method described by Mantel24. The
2-d.f. tests follow similar principles. Testing for association with SNPs on the
X chromosome was carried out using the method proposed by Clayton25
(Supplementary Methods).

The meta-analysis involved studies that used different platforms, necessitat￾ing the use of imputation. Because we had a substantial sample typed on both
platforms, we used a simple linear regression approach to imputation26
(Supplementary Methods). Supplementary Figure 3 online shows the dis￾tribution of the quality of imputation, as measured by the coefficient of
determination, R2
.
Analysis of the replication case-control studies was carried out in a similar
manner, by 1-d.f. comparisons of allele frequencies, with Danish and UK
studies treated as separate strata. We analyzed the family study by the
transmission disequilibrium test (TDT).
The MHC risk score was derived by an adaption of the lasso approach27 to
logistic regression of case-control status versus all SNPs in the MHC region
(defined as spanning from 24.7 Mb to 34.0 Mb on chromosome 6). This was
applied to the combined Affymetrix data, with a dummy variable in the
regression to differentiate WTCCC and GoKinD/NIMH studies, and separately
to the T1DGC Illumina data. The coefficients for the selected regression
equations are shown in Supplementary Table 3 online. The degree of risk
prediction, as shown by the receiver operating curves (Supplementary Fig. 4
online) was very similar in the three study groups.
A case-only test for statistical interaction between each SNP and MHC
risk score was carried out by a 1-d.f. test based on the covariance between MHC
risk score and the SNP genotype coded 0, 1 or 2. These tests were stratified
within study by geographical region or by principal component score,
and information pooled across strata and studies as described above. A 2-d.f.
test for association, possibly modified by MHC, was calculated by adding
the w2 interaction test on 1 d.f. to the 1-d.f. w2 statistic for the stratified
association test.
The lasso analysis of the MHC risk prediction was carried out in the lasso2
package in the R statistical system. All the remaining analysis was carried out in
the snpMatrix package from the bioConductor project28.

aSNPs providing evidence of association at P o 0.05 with T1D in replication study. SNPs showing evidence of replication at P o 0.01 and P o 5  108 overall are listed by autosomes 1–22
and chromosome X (n ¼ 18), followed by those SNPs attaining evidence of association in the replication study at P o 0.01 (n ¼ 3) or 0.05 (n ¼ 1) but failing to reach P o 5  108 overall. bTo
define an LD region for a given focal SNP, we extended the region to the left until either 0.1 cM had been traversed or until reaching another SNP with P o 106. In the latter case we then set
this new SNP as the left bound and repeated the process. The right-hand boundary was defined in the same way. However, the boundaries of the region 7p12.1 (50.87–51.64 Mb) were chosen on
recombination frequency (T1DBase) and the fact that this larger interval contained all of the COBL gene. cGene names are shown for regions with a functionally interesting candidate or for regions
with only one gene. The total number of genes in each LD region are shown in parentheses. dP values for stratified 1-d.f. tests combining data from all three GWA scans in a meta-analysis. eMinor

Odds ratio (95% CI, confidence interval). Odds ratios represent the effect of a single copy of the indicated allele within the multiplicative model for allelic
