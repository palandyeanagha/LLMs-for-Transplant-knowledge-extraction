Abstract
TGF-b1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver
disease. The high frequency of detection of the hepatitis B
virus X (HBx) antigen in liver cells from patients with
chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer suggested that
expression of HBx and TGF-b1 may be associated. To test
this possibility, we examined the expression of TGF-b1 in
the liver of transgenic mice expressing the HBx gene. We
show that the patterns of expression of TGF-b1 and Hbx
protein are similar in these mice and that HBx activates
transcription of the TGF-b1 gene in transfected hepatoma
cells. The cis-acting element within the TGF-b1 gene that is
responsive to regulation by Hbx is the binding site for the
Egr family of transcription factors. We further show that
the Egr-1 protein associates with the HBx protein, allowing
HBx to participate in the transcriptional regulation of im￾mediate–early genes. Our results suggest that expression of
Hbx might induce expression of TGF-b1 in the early stages
of infection and raise the possibility that TGF-b1 may play
a role in hepatitis B virus pathogenesis. (J. Clin. Invest.

Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV)1
 causes acute and chronic liver cell in￾jury and inflammation and is strongly associated with liver can￾cer (1). Its genome contains four recognized open reading
frames, three of which code for known virion proteins (2). The
fourth, called the HBV X gene (HBx), is conserved among all
mammalian hepadnaviruses and has been shown to be ex￾pressed both during viral infection (3–5) and in HBV-associ￾ated hepatocellular carcinoma (6). Recently, it has been shown
that the woodchuck hepatitis virus X gene is important for the
establishment of viral infection in woodchucks, suggesting that
the HBx gene plays an important role in HBV replication in
humans (7).
It is known that HBx trans-activates the expression of
many viral and cellular transcriptional promoters (8–13). It ac￾tivates transcription through certain cis-acting sequences, in￾cluding transcription activator proteins AP-1 and AP-2 (14).
HBx also forms protein–protein complexes with cellular tran￾scription factors such as cyclic AMP-responsive element￾binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor
(ATF-2) and modifies their ability to bind transcriptional en￾hancers (15). Recently, it has been reported that HBx can acti￾vate protein kinase C, a key component of cellular signal trans￾duction (16). Moreover, we have demonstrated that
expression of the HBx gene alone is sufficient for the develop￾ment of liver cancer in transgenic mice (17, 18).
Cytokines affect many functions in the liver, including
amino acid, protein, lipid, mineral, and carbohydrate metabo￾lism. In liver disease, cytokines are involved in the onset of in￾trahepatic immune responses, in liver regeneration, and in the
fibrotic and cirrhotic transformation of the liver after chronic
chemical injury or viral infection (19). To understand the
mechanisms by which HBx induces changes in the liver, we ex￾amined the expression of TGF-b1, a cytokine that inhibits
hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration (20–22) and
stimulates the production of extracellular matrix proteins by
hepatocytes during liver cirrhosis (23, 24). Recent results also
suggest that TGF-b1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of fi￾brosis in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis (25) and in the devel￾opment of hepatocellular carcinoma (26).
In this study, we examined the expression of TGF-b1 in the
livers of transgenic animals harboring the HBx gene under its
own control elements (17, 18). TGF-b1 expression correlated
well with the expression of the HBx protein in the early focal
lesions of altered hepatocytes, suggesting that HBx acted ei￾ther directly or indirectly to increase TGF-b1 expression. We
also showed that HBx trans-activates the TGF-b1 promoter
through the Egr-1 binding sites. Additionally, TGF-b1 expres￾sion was sustained in the adenoma and carcinoma lesions, sug￾gesting that it might play a role in the progressive stages of
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Methods
Immunohistochemistry. The liver tissues were fixed in 10% formalin
and embedded in paraffin. 5-mm sections were immunostained with
either anti-HBx antiserum or anti–TGF-b1 antibodies, visualized by
the avidin–biotin complex method (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlin￾game, CA), and counterstained with hematoxylin. TGF-b1 antibodies
used for immunohistochemistry were raised in rabbits to the NH2

minal 1–30 amino acids of mature TGF-b1 (anti-CC and anti-LC) (27,
28). Anti-CC stained extracellular matrix associated TGF-b1, whereas
anti-LC stained intracellular TGF-b1.
RNA isolation and blotting. Total RNAs from mouse tissues
were extracted by acid guanidinium thiocyanate–phenol chloroform
extraction. Total RNAs (10 mg each) were separated by electrophore￾sis through 1% agarose–formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitro￾cellulose membranes. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of
the membrane were as described previously (29).
Cell culture, DNA transfection, and chloramphenicol acetyltrans￾ferase (CAT) assays. HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s minimal
essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For transient expres￾sion assays, cells were plated at 1.2 3 106
 per 10-cm dish and cultured
for 24 h before transfection by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation
method. Cells were harvested 48 h after addition of DNA, and ex￾tracts were assayed for CAT activity. All transfections were repeated
at least three times. For normalization of transfection efficiencies in
HepG2 cells, a growth hormone expression plasmid (pSVGH) was in￾cluded in the cotransfections. The level of growth hormone expres￾sion was determined using a growth hormone detection kit (Nichols
Institute, San Juan, Capistrano, CA).
Mobility shift assays. Bacterially expressed Egr-1 protein was
kindly provided by Dr. V. Sukhatme (30). The double-stranded oligo￾nucleotides were labeled by Klenow enzyme and gel purified. After
bacterially expressed Egr-1 protein was incubated for 25 min at room
temperature in binding buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl,
1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mg of double￾stranded poly[dI-dC] nonspecific competitor, z 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled
probe), the reaction products were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide
gel (39:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide) and electrophoresed in 0.5 3
TBE (50 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) for 2.5–3.5 h at 8
V/cm. Gels were dried and autoradiographed.
Plasmids. Human TGF-b1 promoter/CAT plasmids (29), GAL4-
ATF-2 (31), GAL4-CREB (32), and G5BCAT reporter constructs
(33) have been previously described. All GAL4-Egr-1 fusion plas￾mids were constructed by inserting the appropriate Egr-1 DNA frag￾ment in-frame to the GAL(1–147) sequence in the vector pSG424
(34). Egr-1 DNA fragments were produced by polymerase chain re￾action. The 59-oligonucleotide used in all amplications contained an
EcoRI site and the 39-oligonucleotide contained an XbaI site. Using
these oligonucleotides, fragments were amplified according to the
standard protocol of the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Nor￾walk, CT). The junctions of all GAL4 fusion plasmids were con￾firmed by DNA sequencing. The HBx expression plasmids (pMAM

ND1-4 and CD1-4) used for the expression of native and mutant HBx
proteins in eukaryotic cells were constructed by cloning the HBx￾ORF insert into the SalI site of pMAM-neo (Promega, Madison, WI).
Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HBx and GST-Egr-1 fusion
proteins. Various GST-HBx and eight GST-Egr-1 fusion proteins ex￾pressed in Escherichia coli were partially purified by adsorption to
glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway,
NJ) in the presence of the detergent N-laurylsarcosine and Triton
X-100 as has been described previously (35).
Egr-1 proteins and HBx protein generated by in vitro transcription
and translation. Plasmids containing the Egr-1 (1–533), Egr-1 (32–
533), Egr-1 (147–533), Egr-1 (249–533), and Egr-1 (1–364) were con￾structed by inserting appropriate PCR-generated fragments of Egr-1
at in-frame EcoRI/BamHI restriction sites in pGEM4 (Promega). For
the synthesis of [35S]methionine-labeled HBx protein by in vitro tran￾scription and translation, pTM1/HBx plasmid was used as template
for RNA synthesis by T7 RNA polymerase followed by translation in
rabbit reticulocyte extracts (Promega).
Results
Expression of TGF-b1 in transgenic mice harboring the HBx
gene. At 4 mo of age, the HBx-transgenic mice exhibited mul￾tifocal areas of altered hepatocytes that were made up of cells
with a poorly stained cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A) and were not de￾tected in nontransgenic littermates (17, 18). Expression of the
HBx protein as seen by immunohistochemical staining of a se￾rial liver section using an anti-HBx serum correlated precisely
with the altered foci (Fig. 1 B), consistent with its role in the
underlying histopathological change. The restricted expression
of HBx in only a subset of cells may reflect the need for spe￾cific transcription factors required for the activation of the vi￾ral regulatory elements and present only in cells at a specific
differentiation state.
Expression of TGF-b1 was assessed by immunohistochemi￾cal staining using isotype-specific peptide antibodies. While
TGF-b1 was not detected in the liver of normal mice (Fig. 1
D), it was found in the livers of the transgenic mice (Fig. 1 C).
Interestingly, the cells that expressed TGF-b1 were located ex￾clusively within the altered foci made up of hepatocytes (17)
where HBx was also highly expressed (compare Fig. 1, B and
C), supporting the possibility that TGF-b1 expression could be
activated by HBx. Whereas every cell within an altered focus
expressed HBx, only a subset of them also expressed TGF-b1.
This latter observation suggests that HBx expression, while
necessary, is insufficient to induce TGF-b1 and argues for epi￾genetic rather than genetic events underlying TGF-b1 activa￾tion by HBx.
At z 8–12 mo of age, tumor nodules begin to appear in the
livers of the transgenic mice. While many of these tumors had
benign characteristics and were diagnosed as adenomas (Fig. 1
E), others appeared malignant and resembled hepatocellular
carcinoma (Fig. 2). HBx protein was highly and uniformly ex￾pressed in both adenoma and carcinoma lesions (Figs. 1 F and
2 A, respectively). Similarly, TGF-b1 expression was also de￾tected in the tumors. For adenomas, the accumulation of intra￾cellular TGF-b1 appeared to differ between individual cells as
has been observed for cells in the altered foci, suggesting that,
while its expression is dependent on the HBx protein, other
factors may also be involved (Fig. 1 G). For carcinomas, the
cells that expressed TGF-b1 were localized to discrete regions
(Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, extracellular TGF-b1 is detected only
in malignant tumors (Fig. 2 C and D) and not in benign lesions
(Fig. 1 H). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this
represents a relative rather than an absolute difference in the
level of accumulation between the two stages of the disease
process.
Northern blot hybridization analysis of RNA extracted
from a control mouse liver and from a transgenic liver with fo￾cal lesions, adenomas, or carcinomas suggested that the in￾crease in TGF-b1 expression in tumors may be regulated at
the transcriptional level. The level of TGF-b1 mRNA was un￾detectable in the control liver, but expressed at high levels in
the tumor (Fig. 3). Taken together, our results demonstrate a

Induction of TGF-b1 by the Hepatitis B Virus HBX 391
strong association between expression of HBx and TGF-b1 in
vivo and suggest the possibility that TGF-b1 might play a part
in early stages of development of hepatocellular carcinoma in￾duced by HBV infection.
Trans-activation of the TGF-b1 promoter by HBx is medi￾ated through the Egr-1 binding sites. To investigate whether
increased expression of TGF-b1 in liver from the HBx-trans￾genic mice was transcriptional, we examined the promoter ac￾tivities of the TGF-b1 gene. The structures of the TGF-b1-
CAT chimeric plasmids used in this study have been described
previously (29, 36). The chimeric plasmids were cotransfected
into the hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2, with the control
expression plasmid (pMAM) or with this same plasmid engi￾neered to express HBx (pMAM-HX). Expression of the TGF￾b1-CAT reporter gene (phTG7-1) was 27-fold higher with
pMAM-HX than with pMAM (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2).
We next sought to identify the specific cis-acting element
that mediates responsiveness to HBx by testing a series of de￾letion constructs of the TGF-b1 promoter linked to CAT. The
induction dropped almost to the basal level when the deletion
reached 271 (Fig. 4, compare lanes 7 and 8).
The TGF-b1 promoter contains two Egr-1 binding sites at
positions 2119 to 2111 (59-CGCCCCCGC-39) and 282 to
274 (59-CCGGGGGCG-39) (Figs. 4 and 5). To determine if
these sites are specifically involved in HBx-mediated transcrip￾tional regulation, we generated chimeric constructs containing
sequences between 2125 and 298 and between 293 and 263
ligated to the adenovirus E4D-38 promoter-CAT vector (37).
Three-base substitution mutants of the Egr-1 binding sites
were also generated and tested for HBx trans-activation (Fig.
5, A and B). No increase in CAT activity was observed when
the control plasmid pE4D-38 was cotransfected with pMAX￾HX, whereas pE4D-38(2125/298) and pE4D-38(293/263)
that contain the separate Egr-1 sites both showed an increase
in CAT activity under the same conditions (Fig. 5, A and B, re￾spectively). Mutant constructs, pE4D-38(2125/298mt) and
pE4D-38(293/263mt), were not activated by HBx (Fig. 5 A,
lanes 5 and 6, and Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4). We also demon￾strated that bacterially expressed Egr-1 binds to these two Egr-1
binding sites (29, data not shown).
A GAL4-Egr-1 fusion protein can mediate transcription ac￾tivation by HBx. To confirm that the Egr-1 protein was directly
involved in HBx-mediated transcriptional activation of TGF-b1,
we designed a protein fusion experiment. Plasmids expressing
various GAL4 fusion proteins were cotransfected with a CAT
reporter construct (G5E1bCAT), which contained five GAL4
binding sites upstream of the AdE1b TATA box (33). To
these transfection mixtures we added either the HBx expres￾sion plasmid (pMAM-HX) or the control expression vector
(pMAM). As expected, HBx did not stimulate transcription on
cotransfection of the minimal GAL4 DNA-binding domain
(Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). On cotransfection of GAL4-Egr-1, how￾ever, transcription was greatly stimulated by HBx (Fig. 6, lanes
7 and 8). Even though it has been shown that the HBx protein
forms protein–protein complexes with both CREB and ATF-2
(15), transcriptional stimulation was observed with GAL4-
ATF-2 (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 10) but not with GAL4-CREB (Fig.
6, lanes 5 and 6). Transcriptional stimulation was also not ob￾served on cotransfection of GAL4-ATF-1 (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and
4) or GAL4-VP1, an activator carrying an acidic activating re￾gion (Fig. 6, lanes 11 and 12). These results indicate that Egr-1
Figure 4. Identification of the HBx-responsive element in the TGF￾b1 promoter. An expression plasmid pMAM (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) 
or the same vector expressing the HBx cDNA (pMAM-HX, lanes 2, 
4, 6, 8, and 10) was cotransfected with reporter plasmids containing 
upstream elements of the human TGF-b1 gene. Representative ex￾periments to determine CAT activity in extracts of transiently trans￾fected HepG2 cells are shown. The fusion genes that were transfected 
are represented schematically at the top of the figure.

through the Egr-1 binding sites. pE4D-38-WT-CAT 
or mutant constructs were generated by inserting 
oligonucleotides from 2125 to 298 (A), from 293 
to 263 (B), or mutant oligonucleotides, shown at 
the top of the figure, of the TGF-b1 promoter into 
the HindIII/XbaI site 59 of the adenovirus E4 mini￾mal promoter of the pE4D-38-CAT vector. 10 mg 
of each chimeric construct was separately trans￾fected into HepG2 cells with either pMAM or 
pMAM-HX.

can specifically support HBx-mediated transcriptional activa￾tion.
Identification of the domain of HBx responsible for its
trans-activation function. The amino acid sequence of the HBx
protein reveals relatively few structural motifs that might be
involved in trans-activation. Several reports indicate that the
COOH terminus may act as an acidic activator (38). We next
examined the effect of HBx deletion constructs on GAL4-Egr-1
transcription to identify the active region of the HBx protein.
A series of NH2
- or COOH-terminal deletion constructs
was generated as shown in Fig. 7. The ND-4 construct, in
which 50 amino acids were deleted from the NH2
 terminus of
the HBx protein, was still able to activate GAL4-Egr-1 tran￾scription, whereas removal of up to 20 amino acids from the
COOH terminus abolished the ability of the protein to acti￾vate transcription (Fig. 7). It had previously been demon￾strated that the block of amino acids from position 132 to 139,
containing the highly conserved sequence FVLGGCRH, is es￾sential for maintaining the trans-activation function (39). Our
results also suggest that the COOH terminus is required for ac￾tivation of the TGF-b1 promoter.
The HBx protein binds to Egr-1 in vitro. We next investi￾gated the ability of HBx to interact directly with Egr-1 in vitro.
Fig. 8 shows the results of the GST affinity chromatography
experiment. An intact 17-kD [35S]methionine-labeled HBx
protein prepared by in vitro translation was found to bind the
GST-Egr-1 protein by GST affinity chromatography (Fig. 8 A,
lane 2). The binding of HBx was not detected with agarose
beads containing GST alone (data not shown). To identify

HBx (pMAM-HX, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) or 
the parent vector (pMAM, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and

plasmid G5BCAT and expression vector for 
GAL4 binding domain (1–147) (lanes 1 and 2), 
GAL4-ATF-1 (lanes 3 and 4), GAL4-CREB 
(lanes 5 and 6), GAL4-Egr-1 (lanes 7 and 8), 
GAL4-ATF-2 (lanes 9 and 10), or the acidic acti￾vator GAL4-VP1 (lanes 11 and 12). The re￾porter construct G5BCAT contains 5 GAL4 
binding sites upstream of the Ad E1b TATA 
box and a CAT reporter gene. GAL4-VP1 con￾tains VP16 activator sequences between amino 
acids 411 and 454 fused to the GAL4 binding do￾main, GAL4(1–147).

the coprecipitated radiolabeled proteins were resolved in a 4–20%

as a negative control. (B) Seven segments representing GST-Egr-1

(247–364), were constructed using internal PCR primers (Fig.
8 B). All proteins from these chimeras were produced from
IPTG-induced E. coli bacterial hosts and analyzed by SDS￾PAGE (data not shown). The GST affinity assay was used to
show that HBx protein can bind to the GST-Egr-1. The results
revealed that HBx could bind to intact Egr-1 (1–533), Egr-1
(247–414), and Egr-1 (335–418), all containing the three zinc
finger domains (Fig. 8 A, lanes 2, 5, and 8), but not to Egr-1
(1–100), Egr-1 (1–150), Egr-1 (410–533), Egr-1 (247–334), and
Egr-1 (247–364) (Fig. 8 A, lanes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9).
The design of the GST bead affinity binding assay was re￾versed by using [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro–translated
forms of Egr-1 to identify which segment of Egr-1 was in￾volved in binding to HBx protein. In Fig. 9, a Sepharose bead–
bound GST fusion protein containing the entire HBx protein
was used. The results revealed that intact Egr-1 (1–533), Egr-1
(32–533), Egr-1 (147–533), and Egr-1 (249–533) could bind to
the HBx protein. However, the NH2
-terminal segment of Egr-1
(1–364), which does not contain the zinc finger domain, did not
show any binding to HBx. [35S]Methionine-labeled in vitro–
synthesized preparations of the intact human p53 and the
ATF-2 protein served as positive controls, and the ATF-1 pro￾tein served as a negative control for the binding specificity in
this assay (15, 40).
Discussion
It has been shown that HBx is capable of trans-activating a va￾riety of viral (9, 12, 41) and cellular promoters (13, 16, 41). Re￾cently, we also demonstrated that HBx is directly involved in
the development of liver cancer by generating transgenic mice
harboring the entire HBx gene (17). Using these same trans￾genic mice, we have now been able to show a strong associa￾tion of expression of HBx and TGF-b1, which is known to play
an important role in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis (23–
25) in vivo. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrate that
HBx can directly induce the expression of TGF-b1. We dem￾onstrated that TGF-b1 localized immunochemically to the
HBx-expressing cells and that sequences homologous to a pre￾viously defined Egr-1–responsive element (30) mediate the
regulation of TGF-b1 promoter activity by the HBx protein.
These results suggest that TGF-b1 may be one of the media￾tors of HBV pathogenesis.
Egr-1, also known as TIS-8 (42), Zif268 (43–45), Krox 24
(46), and NGFI-A (47), is a recently characterized transcrip￾tion factor that is responsive to cell division signals (48). It con￾tains three zinc fingers, which bind to the target sequence
GCGGGGGCG (48, 49), also recognized by the zinc finger
transcription factor WT1 (50). Egr-1 is rapidly induced in re￾sponse to a variety of stimuli (48). Like the protooncogenes
c-fos and c-jun, Egr-1 is induced within 30 min by extracellular
growth signals in the absence of protein synthesis and when
cells of certain lineages are cued to differentiate. Promoters of
many genes including insulin-like growth factor II (51) contain
Egr-1 binding sites. These observations suggest that regulation
of Egr-1 function may lead to changes of cell physiology.
Mutational analysis of HBx has demonstrated that multiple
structural motifs are separately involved in the activation of
different promoters (38). The COOH terminus contains the
moderately acidic alpha helix. Removal of up to 12 amino ac￾ids from the COOH terminus did not change its trans-activa￾tion function in vitro (8, 39, 52–54), whereas deletion of amino
acids between positions 132 and 139, containing the highly
conserved sequence FVLGGCRH, resulted in the loss of ac￾tivity (39). Interestingly, the HBx protein extends nine amino
acids beyond that of the woodchuck hepatitis virus at the
COOH terminus (7). It appears that the amino acids between
positions 126 and 136 of woodchuck hepatitis virus are impor￾tant for virus replication in the natural host, suggesting that
this region is crucial to the function of the protein (7). In this
study, we have also demonstrated that deletion of amino acids
from positions 136 to 153 of the HBx protein abolished its
trans-activating function.
It is known that the HBx protein does not bind directly to
DNA but instead forms protein–protein complexes with cellu￾lar transcription factors like CREB and ATF-2, and alters
their binding specificities (15). We have demonstrated that
HBx stimulates transcription conferred by GAL4-ATF-2 but
not by GAL4-CREB. Since ATF-2 lacks a constitutive activat￾ing region (31), a cellular factor like the retinoblastoma gene
product (55) or a viral protein such as the adenovirus E1a may
bind to ATF-2 and supply the transcriptional activating func￾tion. The fact that HBx is not able to induce transcription con￾ferred by GAL4-CREB indicates that HBx only alters the
DNA binding specificity of CREB and that the activation po￾tential of CREB possibly requires phosphorylation (56, 57).
In the present study, we have demonstrated that HBx
forms a complex with the Egr-1 protein. Because phosphoryla￾tion events modulate the activity of a number of transcription
factors, this could impart another level of regulation on Egr-1
activity. It is of interest to note that Natoli et al. (58) have sug￾gested that the HBx protein might induce posttranslational

(A) Five kinds of Egr-1 deletion mutants that were synthesized in 
vitro and labeled with [35S]methionine were coprecipitated with the 
GST-HBx fusion protein. The [35S]methionine-labeled Egr-1 deletion 
mutants were subjected to the GST affinity chromatography. The 
[
35S]methionine-labeled p53 and ATF-2 were used as positive con￾trols, and the [35S]methionine-labeled ATF-1 was used as a negative 
control. (B) Results of the GST affinity chromatography were pre￾sented diagrammatically.

modifications that render the AP1 complex more efficient in
its DNA-binding ability. Phosphorylation and dephosphoryla￾tion of c-Fos and c-Jun have been described and shown to have
a critical role in the regulation of AP1 function (59, 60).
TGF-b1 is an important cytokine in the pathophysiology of
liver fibrosis, stimulating the production of extracellular
matrix. In hepatic fibrosis, a marked increase is seen in the
hepatic extracellular matrix proteins, including collagens,
glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans. In both experimental
models of hepatic fibrosis and in patients with liver cirrhosis,
increased expression of type I collagen genes is seen (61). The
TGF-bs also stimulate type I collagen gene expression in pri￾mary cultures of hepatocytes, Ito cells, and fibroblasts (23).
Castilla et al. (25) have shown that the level of TGF-b1 mRNA
in liver biopsy specimens correlated positively with hepatic fi￾brosis in a large group of patients with chronic viral hepatitis,
suggesting that TGF-b1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of
hepatic fibrosis.
TGF-b1 most often acts as a negative growth regulator
(62). This effect must be overcome before tumor progression
can occur (63). Evidence from animal models as well as human
tumors indicates that malignant tumors including human hepa￾tocellular carcinoma secrete high levels of TGF-b1 (26, 64–66).
Increased secretion of TGF-b1 by cells that have lost respon￾siveness to its growth inhibitory activities is thought to facili￾tate tumor progression by indirect means such as suppression
of immune surveillance and stimulation of tumor stroma. In
this study, we have demonstrated that the level of TGF-b1
mRNA is significantly increased in livers from the HBx-trans￾genic mice and that expression of TGF-b1 correlates well with
that of the HBx protein.
A recent study has shown that 84% of patients with pri￾mary hepatocellular carcinoma who are HBV carriers were
HBx positive in their tumor cells (67). Evidence that expres￾sion of TGF-b1 correlates well with that of the HBx protein in
transgenic mice and that TGF-b1 expression is also elevated in
hepatic cirrhosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis sug￾gests that further work should be done to define the specific
role of TGF-b1 in the pathogenesis of HBV-associated liver
diseases, including primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
