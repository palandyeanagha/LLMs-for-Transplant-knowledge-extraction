Abstract


Background: Lung density measurements by computed tomography
have previously been found to be a more sensitive indicator of
disease progression in emphysema of α1-antitrypsin deficiency than
lung function measurements. The aim of this study was to
investigate the predictive potential of several parameters, including
CT scanning, for mortality in patients with severe α1-antitrypsin
deficiency.
Methods: Over a 5 year period, 256 patients with α1-antitrypsin
deficiency (PiZ phenotype) were assessed, of whom 254 underwent
lung function testing and 197 had thoracic CT scans. Lung function,
CT scans, health status (St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire,
SGRQ), and other clinical data of survivors and non-survivors were
compared and these parameters were applied to survival analyses.
Results: There were 22 deaths in this patient cohort, 10 of which
were classified as “respiratory” deaths. Baseline lung function
parameters (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), carbon
monoxide transfer coefficient (Kco)), and CT scores were
significantly lower in the non-survivors than in the survivors. 170 of
the 256 patients had complete data for entry into multiple
regression analyses (Cox proportional hazards model). In the
univariate analysis, upper zone expiratory scan had the best
association with all cause (p = 0.001) and respiratory mortality
(p<0.001), whereas FEV1 (p = 0.158 all cause, 0.015 respiratory)
and Kco (p = 0.002 all cause, 0.012 respiratory) had poorer
associations with mortality. Only age gave further independent
predictive information regarding all cause or respiratory mortality
when the CT scan was entered into the survival analyses.
Conclusions: CT scanning predicts respiratory and all cause
mortality in α1-antitrypsin deficiency and appears to be superior to
lung function parameters, especially FEV1.
