A B S T R A C T The quantitative contributions of pan￾creatic responsiveness and insulin sensitivity to glu￾cose tolerance were measured using the "minimal
modeling technique" in 18 lean and obese subjects
(88-206% ideal body wt). The individual contributions
of insulin secretion and action were measured by in￾terpreting the dynamics of plasma glucose and insulin
during the intravenous glucose tolerance test in terms
of two mathematical models. One, the insulin kinetics
model, yields parameters of first-phase (4),) and second￾phase (42) responsivity of the p-cells to glucose. The
other glucose kinetics model yields the insulin sensi￾tivity parameter, S,. Lean and obese subjects were sub￾divided into good (KG > 1.5) and lower (KG < 1.5) glu￾cose tolerance groups. The etiology of lower glucose
tolerance was entirely different in lean and obese sub￾jects. Lean, lower tolerance was related to pancreatic
insufficiency (02 77% lower than in good tolerance con￾trols [P < 0.03]), but insulin sensitivity was normal (P
> 0.5). In contrast, obese lower tolerance was entirely
due to insulin resistance (SI diminished 60% [P
< 0.01]); pancreatic responsiveness was not different
from lean, good tolerance controls (0,: P > 0.06; 4)2:
P > 0.40). Subjects (regardless of weight) could be
segregated into good and lower tolerance by the

product of second-phase ,-cell responsivity and insulin
sensitivity (b2-SI). Thus, these two factors were pri￾marily responsible for overall determination of glu￾cose tolerance.
The effect of Xl was to modulate the KG value within
those groups whose overall tolerance was determined
by 2 SI. This q51 modulating influence was more pro￾nounced among insulin sensitive (4) vs. KG, r = 0.79)
than insulin resistant (obese, low tolerance; Xl vs.
KG, r = 0.91) subjects. This study demonstrates the
feasibility of the minimal model technique to deter￾mine the etiology of impaired glucose tolerance.
INTRODUCTION
The ability to dispose of carbohydrate depends on the
responsiveness of the pancreatic p-cells to glucose and
the sensitivity of the glucose utilizing tissues to the
secreted insulin. Insulin resistance is an important
factor particularly in the etiology of type II, non￾ketosis prone diabetes (1-5). The primacy of insulin
resistance in this state remains controversial, however,
and most investigators agree that at least a relative im￾pairment in pancreatic secretory capacity is important
in noninsulin-dependent diabetic states (6-8).
Understanding the etiology of the various forms of
impaired glucose tolerance requires techniques for
measuring both pancreatic responsiveness and insulin
sensitivity, and a means to evaluate their relative
contributions to overall glucose tolerance. The major
difficulty in making independent measures of these
two factors is the glucose insulin feedback rela￾J. Clin. Invest. © The American Society for Clinical Investigation, Inc. * 0021-9738/81/12/1456/12 $1.00

tionship, which tends to complicate glucose/insulin dy￾namics and obscure the causality of impaired tolerance
(9). During the past decade, several laboratories have
approached this problem by breaking the feedback
relationship, either by pharmacological suppression of
pancreatic insulin secretion (10) or by external feed￾back control (glucose clamp) to circumvent the effect
of plasma insulin to change plasma glucose (11). These
methods for measuring insulin sensitivity have con￾tributed to understanding the etiology of intolerance,
but they require extensive experimental manipulation,
entail some risk to the patient, and have been used only
in a few clinical research centers.
We have developed a new approach to quantify both
pancreatic responsiveness and insulin sensitivity in the
intact organism. This method, the "minimal model"
technique, uses computer modeling to analyze the
plasma glucose and insulin dynamics during an intra￾venous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT).' A mathe￾matical model of pancreatic insulin release and dis￾tribution is used to obtain characteristic parameters of
insulin secretory responsiveness to glucose (both first
phase [0,] and second phase [4k]) by predicting the
time-course of plasma insulin, when the plasma glucose
time-course is supplied (12). Conversely, an index of
insulin sensitivity (SI) is measured from a second
model that predicts glucose kinetics, when the insulin
time-course is supplied (13). The three characteristic
parameters (4k, 02, and SI) represent an integrated
metabolic portrait of a single individual. Because it is
not necessary to interrupt the glucose-insulin feedback
relationship, the experimental manipulations can be
performed in a routine clinical setting with minimal
patient risk.
In this report we present the first application of the
minimal model approach to analysis of glucose toler￾ance in humans. The purpose of the study was to de￾termine the specific contributions of pancreatic re￾sponsiveness and insulin sensitivity to normal and low
glucose tolerance in lean and obese subjects.
METHODS
Subjects. IVGTT with frequent sampling was performed
on 8 male and 10 female subjects ranging from 88 to 206%
of ideal body weight (% IBW) as estimated using Metro￾politan Life Insurance tables. Subjects were in good health,
euthyroid, and not taking any medication that would alter
carbohydrate metabolism. Most lean subjects (88-105% IBW)
were outpatient Northwestern University students; most
obese subjects (130-206% IBW) were inpatients undergoing
metabolic study at the Northwestern University Clinical Re￾search Center. Informed consent was obtained in all cases.
Performance of the IVGTT. Subjects consumed at least
300 g carbohydrate/d for 3 d preceding the test, which was
begun at 0800 following an overnight fast. The tests were

performed in the Clinical Research Center. A "butterfly"
needle (Deseret Company, Sandy, Utah) was inserted into an
antecubital vein, and patency was maintained with a slow
saline drip. After a 30-min rest period basal samples (2 ml)
were taken at -13, -8, and -3 min, following which glucose
(300 mg/kg) was injected smoothly over 60 s, starting at time
(t) = 0. To define glucose and insulin dynamics precisely, 23
additional 2-ml samples were collected at the following times:
2,4,6,8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19,22,27,32,42,52,62,72,82,92, 102,
122, 142, 162, and 182 min. Samples were collected within
15 s, and great care was taken to avoid contamination with
saline or blood from previous samples. Samples were mixed
with 10 U powdered heparin and 1 mg NaF, and centrifuged
under refrigeration. Plasma was stored at -20 C until assay for
glucose and insulin.
Assays. Glucose was measured in triplicate by the
glucose oxidase technique on an automated analyzer
(Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, Ohio). The
coefficient of variation of a single glucose determination was
+ 1.5%. Insulin was measured in duplicate by radioimmuno￾assay, with dextran-charcoal separation using a human insulin
standard (Novo Corp., Copenhagen, Denmark). Guinea pig
anti-insulin serum was produced in our laboratory; l25I-insulin
was purchased on a regular basis from Amersham Corp.,
Arlington Heights, Ill. Within-assay coefficient of variation was
±7% from 8 to 200 ,uU/ml; between-assay variation was + 11%.
Analysis of data. The theoretical basis underlying esti￾mation of the characteristic parameters from IVGTT results
has been published in detail (12-14), and will only be sum￾marized here. KG values, calculated for purposes ofcomparison
with our parameters, were calculated as the least-squares
slope of the ln (glucose concentration) vs. time relationship
between 10 and 42 min after glucose injection.
General approach: partition and minimal modeling. The
system regulating the glucose concentration is envisioned as
being partitioned into two parts: (a) the glucose-dependent
segment that determines the plasma insulin (the pancreas
and insulin-degrading tissues) and (b) the insulin-dependent
segment which determines the plasma glucose (glu￾cose producing and utilizing tissues). We have previously
evolved specific "minimal" mathematical models for each of
the two parts. The two minimal models selected have been
shown to be the simplest physiologically based representa￾tions that can respectively account (a) for the observed glu￾cose kinetics when the plasma insulin values are supplied
and (b) for the observed insulin kinetics when the plasma
glucose values are supplied. Using the two independent
minimal models to describe the dynamic glucose and
insulin responses during IVGTT, characteristic parameters
of insulin sensitivity and pancreatic responsivity are generated.
Parameter ofinsulin sensitivity, S,. The minimal model of
glucose disappearance is diagrammed in Fig. la. The coef￾ficients ofthe minimal model (c.f., reference 13) are estimated
for a single individual from the IVGTT data by allowing the
model to predict the observed fall in plasma glucose when the
(measured) plasma insulin is supplied. In accounting for the
glucose kinetics by considering plasma insulin as input and
plasma glucose as output it is not necessary to formulate any
assumptions as to the mechanisms by which pancreatic insulin
secretion is controlled ("partition analysis" [14]). S, can be
calculated (13) for a single individual as the ratio of two of the
parameters of the glucose disappearance model. This ratio is
proportional to the concentration of "active" insulin in a
compartment remote from plasma, and the ability of that
insulin to enhance glucose disappearance. The units of
SI, so estimated, are minute-' per microunit per milliliter;
that is, the increase in the fractional clearance rate of glucose
per unit change in the plasma insulin concentration.

FIGURE 1 (A) Minimal model of glucose kinetics used to cal￾culate insulin sensitivity from IVGTT. Plasma insulin [I(t)]
enters a "remote compartment" where it is active in
accelerating glucose disappearance into the periphery and

where the variable X(t) is proportional to insulin in the remote
compartment. Insulin sensitivity index (SI) is -P3/P2; equal
to insulin's effect to augment the tendency for glucose self￾normalization. The units of SI are min-/VU per ml (fractional
glucose disappearance rate per unit insulin concentration).
Explicit definitions of X and the parameters in terms of frac￾tional turnover constants are found in reference (13). (B)
Model of insulin kinetics used to calculate pancreatic re￾sponsivity parameters 41 and O2 (12). G(t) is supplied to this
model, which predicts I(t). First-phase insulin release is repre￾sented as a bolus of insulin entering the plasma compartment
at the time of the glucose injection (30). Sensitivity of the
first-phase release to glucose is 1 = Io/nAG, where lo is the
early peak plasma insulin concentration, n is the time constant
for insulin disappearance (min-') and AG is the maximum
change in the glucose concentration due to the glucose in￾jection. Second-phase insulin secretion is described by
dl(t) -
-y(G(t) - h)t - nI(t) dt
The rate of increase of second-phase secretion is propor￾tional (by fy) to the degree by which glucose exceeds a
threshold level (h). The factor O2 represents the sensitivity
of the rate of rise of the second phase to glucose, and is de￾fined as second-phase pancreatic responsivity.
Parameters of pancreatic responsiveness to glucose, X,
and 0,. Insulin secretory parameters are calculated for a
given individual from the IVGTT by using our minimal model
of insulin secretion and disapparance (Fig. lb). The model as￾sumes that the early peak in insulin secretion represents an
"injection" of insulin into plasma by the pancreas in direct
proportion to the rise in glucose. First-phase responsivity (0,)
is the amount of insulin (per unit volume) that can be ac￾counted for by this assumed injection, per unit change in
plasma glucose. It is assumed in the model that the rate of
rise of second-phase insulin secretion is proportional to the
plasma glucose; the second-phase responsivity (42) is the pro￾portionality factor between glucose and the rate ofrise (15, 16).
Methods of parameter estimation. Parameter estimation
was perfonned on a digital computer (IBM 370/168, IBM Corp.,
White Plains, N. Y.) using a nonlinear least squares technique
(17), and accuracy of the parameter estimates was evaluated
using the covariance matrix (18). Analysis of the relation be￾tween estimated parameters within patient groups was per￾formed using Student's t test and regression analysis (19).
RESULTS
Analysis of IVGTT. Characteristics of the 18 sub￾jects are listed in Table I. Basal glucose values were
all < 115 mg/dl. There were significant positive correla￾tions between the IBW and both basal glucose (r
= 0.59, P < 0.01) and insulin (r = 0.62, P < 0.01).
IVGTT results are summarized in Table II. Because
the lean control subjects tended to be taller than the
obese patients, the dose of glucose based upon IBW
was 14% greater in the lean subjects. This difference in
dose was reflected in an incremental change in plasma

glucose concentration (A glucose) of 194+11 mg/dl in
the lean subjects; 21% greater than the increment in the
obese (A glucose = 153+14 mg/dl; P < 0.025). Despite
the lesser increase in plasma glucose concentration in
the obese, they manifested a 2.8-fold greater integrated
insulin response.
No significant overall difference in KG values was ob￾served in obese vs. lean subjects (P > 0.09), although
the obese KG tended to be lower. Thus, to some extent
at least, it was apparent that obese patients were able
to compensate for overall insulin resistance by means
of pancreatic hyperresponsivity. The frequency distri￾bution of KG for all subjects is shown in Fig. 2. Although
the distribution was not absolutely bimodal, there was
separation of individuals at KG = 1.5. For purposes of
analysis, we chose KG> 1.5 as "good tolerance" and
KG < 1.5 as "low tolerance." Five lean and three obese
subjects had good tolerance; seven obese and three
lean individuals segregated as "low tolerance."
Fig. 3 shows the glucose and insulin during the
IVGTT of four patient groups, segregated on the bases
of body weight and glucose tolerance: group I (lean,
good tolerance); group II (lean, low tolerance); group
III (obese, good tolerance) and group IV (obese, low
tolerance). In all groups, glucose injection provoked
rapid insulin secretory responses characterized by an
early peak at 4 min, followed by a prolonged secondary
phase; however, qualitative differences in the shapes
and magnitudes were observed (Fig. 3). For example,
only modest first and second phases were evident in the
responses of group II, in contrast to the other three
groups. Also, the second phases were prolonged in
groups II and IV, when compared with their respec￾tive good-tolerance counterparts. The prolonged

second phases corresponded to the extended periods of
glucose elevation. In all experiments glucose fell below
basal; at 140 min after injection glucose was an average
of 10+2 mg/dl below the basal value (P < 0.001) but
had usually begun renormalization by 180 min. No
comparable "undershoot" in plasma insulin was
observed.
The goal of our analytic approach is to account for
the variations in glucose tolerance in terms of the
specific contributions of pancreatic responsiveness
and insulin sensitivity. To do this, we used the two
minimal models to describe the IVGTT data of each
patient. Fig. 4 shows for two patients the ability of the
glucose disappearance model (Fig. la) to describe
glucose kinetics, given insulin, and the ability of the
insulin kinetics model (Fig. lb) to describe insulin
kinetics, given glucose. The specific model coefficients
obtained from modeling the dynamics of all patients
(separated into groups) are given in Table III.
Characteristic metabolic parameters. The coef￾ficients of the two models listed in Table III were
reduced to three characteristic metabolic parameters:
0, 0,, and S, (Table IV). Low tolerance in lean sub￾jects was associated with insufficient pancreatic re￾sponsiveness. Although SI was the same in the lean
good tolerant and lean low tolerant subjects (group I;
SI = 4.0+1.0; group II; SI = 5.1+ 1.3 min-4/,uU per ml;
P > 0.5), the low tolerance of lean patients (group II)
was associated with a 77% lower second-phase re￾sponsivity, compared with the lean good tolerant group
I (P < 0.03). There was also a tendency for first-phase
responsivity to be lower in the second group but the
difference in (1 was not significant (P < 0.08) because
of wide variation in (1l.
In contrast to the lean individuals, low glucose tol￾erance in the obese patients was related to insulin
resistance rather than diminished pancreatic re￾sponsiveness. Insulin sensitivity was 60% diminished
in group IV obese low tolerance patients (compared
with lean, good tolerance group I controls; [P < 0.01]),
whereas in the group IV patients second-phase respon￾siveness was not different from group I (31+6 com￾pared with 27+7; P > 0.4). As in the lean patients,
there was wide variation in (1 in the group IV patients
(range of Xl: 1.0 to 18.2). However, even in those group
IV patients for whom 0, was increased (subjects 13
and 15, for example [Table IV]), the increased first
phase responsivity was not sufficient to overcome the
intolerance occasioned by normal 1)2 coupled with a
severely diminished S, typical of the obese, low toler￾ance individuals.
Significance of k2 SI in determining tolerance.
Since impaired tolerance can be associated with
either diminished second-phase responsivity or SI, we
examined the hypothesis that the product O2 Si ("dis￾position factor") may be a convenient means for segre￾gating individuals of varying tolerance, regardless of
weight. The value of this product was 160+26 for all
good tolerance subjects and 40+7 (P < 0.001) for the
low tolerance subjects (Table IV). Fig. 5 (top) indicates
thatO2(SI for 9 of the 10 low tolerance individuals is
below 75, and that the product exceeds 75 for 7 of the
8 good tolerance subjects. Also shown in Fig. 5 is the
relationship between Si and 12 for all subjects. The
hyperbola representing 02 SI = 75 separates most good
tolerant (upper right) from low tolerant (lower left) sub￾jects. Thus, the position of a subject on this plot (above
or below the "75" curve) determines not only whether
the subject is tolerant, but also the relative contribu￾tion ofpancreatic responsiveness (02) or SI to the degree
of tolerance that the individual exhibits.
Influence of first-phase responsivity on glucose
tolerance. The ability to segregate on the basis of
tolerance, in terms of the O2* Sl product alone suggests
that these two factors are primarily responsible for glu￾cose tolerance in a given individual. Due to the wide
variation of (l within groups, it was not possible to ob￾tain clear segregation using 11 -SI (not shown). None￾theless, first-phase insulin responsivity appears to play
a role in the determination of tolerance within groups
whose overall tolerance is determined by O2 Sl. Fig. 6
shows the relation between K6, and X1 in the four
groups. KG was highly correlated with 40, in the obese,
low tolerance subjects (group IV; r = 0.91, P < 0.001).

crease of (A, from 1 to 10 was associated with an in￾crease in KG of only 0.3 min-'. In contrast, in the other
subjects (groups I, II and III), for whom insulin resis￾tance was not a general characteristic (n = 11, SI = 5.1
±0.7) a similar increase in was associated with an
increase in KG of 0.9 min-'. Thus, the difference in SI
between these groups is reflected in the extent to which
the variation in first phase secretion can result in
altered KG. That the differences in KG within these
populations can be accounted for by SI and not O2 iS
indicated by the fact that the mean second phase sensi￾tivities in these two populations were not different
(2 = 27+6(nonresistant); = 31+6(resistant);P > 0.4).
In addition to insulin-related factors the tolerance to
glucose is dependent upon mechanisms related to the
levels of glucose per se: hepatic glucose autoregulation
(20); and insulin-independent glucose uptake (21).
We have referred to the sum of these factors as "glu￾cose effectiveness" (13). It is of interest to consider
whether alterations in glucose effectiveness contribute
to the glucose intolerance of the obese subjects.
In the glucose kinetics model (Fig. lb) the coefficient
P1 is the insulin-independent fractional turnover con￾stant for glucose disposition (cf., reference 13); P1 is
equal to glucose effectiveness when insulin remains

lower in subjects with low tolerance than in good

since there is an inverse correlation between insulin
levels and SI, basal insulin may provide a measure of
the degree of insulin resistance (22, 23). Fig. 7 demon￾strates that for those patients for whom SI is <3.0

(r = 0.65, P < .03). However, over the range of insulin
sensitivities from 3.0-10.0 min-' ,U per ml the corre￾lation was not observed (r = 0.08).

(25) reported a diminution in S12 of 53% in obese
(158-265% IBW) compared to lean subjects (5); re￾markably similar to the 60% we calculated from the
IVGTT. Thus, our results are consistent with the
diminished SI of obese subjects elucidated by both
qualitative (26) and quantitative techniques (25).
It is important to consider whether the lower value
of SI for obese subjects was related to an actual dif￾ference in sensitivity of the insulin-responsive tissues,
rather than simply increased patient mass. The in￾creased mass of heavier subjects would normally result
in a proportional increase in glucose distribution space.
However, because our control group tended to be taller
than the obese subjects, the obese glucose space ex￾ceeded the space of lean individuals by only 16% (Ta￾ble II). Because of this, there was only a 26% difference
in the change in plasma glucose occasioned by injection
in the obese vs. lean subjects. It is certainly possible
that the glucose kinetics may not be applicable with the
same set of parameters for a given individual, over the
entire range of possible glucose doses. However, it
seems a reasonable assumption that our model with a
unique parameter set may well apply over a dose range
which induces glucose increments from 153 to 194 mg/
dl, particularly in view of the ability of this model to

simulate a wide variety of glucose dynamic patterns
(13). It is doubtful the 60% diminution in insulin sensi￾tivity in the obese can be an artifact of a 26% difference
in glucose increment. Nonetheless, we believe that a
more complete study of the range of doses over which
the model is applicable would be worthwhile.

The evident primacy of 42 and SI in the determination
of tolerance between groups led us to propose the
product of these two factors, 02* SI, as a "disposition in￾dex," a measure of tolerance which includes within it
the quantitative contributions of the individual factors
related to the observed tolerance. It is important to
reconcile our view that 4)2 and S, are the primary deter￾minants of glucose tolerance with evidence that the ini￾tial peak is an important factor if not the major deter￾minant of the value of the KG (6, 7, 27). In these studies
we found that within the lean or obese groups of indi￾viduals the 4)2 and S, values were rather consistent,
however there was large variation in 4l within each
group and large overlap in 4) values between different
groups. The results of this study lead to the view that
phase 1 and phase 2 pancreatic responsivity have dif￾fering roles in the determination of the KG: 42 functions
to establish an overall range of tolerance according
to body weight, for example; 4l determines where
within that range a given individual will lie.
The metabolic status of an individual patient can be
represented by his position on the SI vs. 42 plot (Fig. 5).
The location on the SI 42 plane indicates not only the
degree of tolerance (whether the individual lies
"above" or "below" the 42 SI = 75 tolerance boundary)
but the relative importance of the pancreas and insulin￾sensitive tissues in the etiology of observed glucose
tolerance. An approach to optimal treatment of insulin￾independent diabetes could be based upon the ability
of individual therapies to alter the position of a given
individual on the 4)2/SI plot. Application of this ap￾proach to therapy for a single individual would include
measurement of 42 and SI from the IVGTT and deter￾mination of the therapy vector (or direction and magni￾tude of change in S, and 4)2) needed to return the in￾tolerant individual to a region of tolerance. Having
characterized the vectors for the available therapies
(e.g., sulfonylurea treatment, weight loss, insulin, etc.)
it may be possible on this basis to design the therapy
best suited to each individual patient.
An interesting relationship that emerged from the
present studies was that intolerant subjects were
characterized by diminished glucose "effectiveness":
that is, glucose had impaired ability to normalize its
own concentration under hyperglycemic conditions in
the absence of an acute insulin response. This result is
consistent with the finding of Olefsky et al. (28) who
showed that glucose utilization at basal glucose levels
was diminished in obese, diabetic, individuals. Because
the diminished glucose effectiveness of obese subjects
is independent of acute changes in insulin it may be
related to the influence of basal insulin concentration
on the levels of those enzymes that are dependent upon
a constant insulin environment for their activities, such
as glucokinase and glycogen synthase in the liver (29,
30) and glucose transport units in tissues for which glu￾cose transport is insulin dependent (31). Thus, the
diminished glucose effectiveness may be related to in￾sulin resistance in that it could be a secondary mani￾festation of the resistance of tissues to the "permissive"
rather than acute effects of the hormone.
The present results provide the opportunity to exam￾ine whether basal insulin levels represent a good
measure of insulin sensitivity (22, 23). A good negative
correlation between basal insulin and Si was observed
under conditions of frank insulin resistance (Si < 3.0);
however, over the large range of S, in normal, tolerant
subjects (3.0 < SI < 10.0) a significant correlation be￾tween basal insulin and measured resistance was not ob￾served. (That sensitivity can vary over such a large
range in normal individuals was originally reported by
Sherwin and his colleagues [32], and we have a
similar experience in normal dogs [13]). It is not sur￾prising, however, that in normal individuals, basal in￾sulin is not a simple function of Si, but also depends on
factors which may themselves change with insulin re￾sistance. Insulin levels are also determined by basal
pancreatic insulin secretion, insulin clearance, and
neural mechanisms (33). When frank insulin resistance
is manifest, it is reasonable that the resistance effect
can overwhelm other mechanisms that control basal
insulin, and hyperinsulinemia in proportion to the re￾sistance is observed. However, when S, is in the normal
range, it is only one of several possibly equipotent fac￾tors which determine basal insulin, and the clear cor￾relation between SI and basal insulin disappears.
Therefore, although there may be a correlation be￾tween basal insulin and Sl, particularly in the insulin
resistant state, the former apparently cannot be
viewed as an accurate measure of the latter under all
conditions.
The present studies demonstrate that the minimal
model approach may be applicable to studying the eti￾ology of altered carbohydrate metabolism in man. In
addition to comparative validation with other tech￾niques, it will be useful to explore whether the IVGTT
is the optimal perturbation to be used to estimate meta￾bolic parameters. Present studies have been limited to
evaluation of IVGTT results. It remains to be proven
whether the model and its parameters will apply and
can be obtained from other doses and other stimulus
patterns. Possibly future studies will yield a better
temporal pattern of glucose and/or insulin adminis￾tration that will lead to easier estimation of metabolic
parameters. In any event, complete validation of the
model and optimal input patterns will be required be￾fore the approach can be proposed as a clinical tool.
