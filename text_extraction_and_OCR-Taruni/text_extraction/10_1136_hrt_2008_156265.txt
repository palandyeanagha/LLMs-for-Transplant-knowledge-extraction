Abstract
The number of adult patients with a systemic right ventricle (RV) is
steadily increasing. Survival is relatively good in these patients, but
deterioration of the systemic RV seems inevitable. Although
therapeutic options for patients with LV failure are well established,
their role in patients with systemic RV failure is often undefined. To
appreciate the potency of LV failure therapy in patients with a
systemic RV, insight into pathophysiology of systemic RV failure
and into recent developments in therapeutic research are
indispensible. This review provides these insights, and will facilitate
and ameliorate therapeutic decision making in patients with a
systemic RV.
