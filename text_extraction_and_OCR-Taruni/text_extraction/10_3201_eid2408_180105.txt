Acute hepatitis E virus infections occurred during the third 
trimester in 2 pregnant women in France who sought treat￾ment with nonspecific symptoms or asymptomatic elevation 
of liver enzymes. Infection cleared quickly in both women. 
We detected no hepatitis E RNA in 1 newborn’s feces at 3 
weeks of age.

n low-income countries, estimates of 20 million hepa￾titis E virus (HEV) infections and 70,000 deaths have 
been reported for 2005. Increased mortality rate in preg￾nant women is well described but unexplained; pregnant 
women with symptomatic HEV infection have a 10-fold 
higher probability of death, especially in countries of the 
Indian subcontinent and Africa in which genotypes 1 and 
2 are prevalent (1). In addition, up to 50% mother‐to‐
child transmission rates have been reported, resulting in 
both premature births and prenatal deaths (2). In high￾income countries with high seroprevalence rates, infec￾tion is usually asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases 
are caused by HEV genotype 3 (3); illness ranges from 
mild to fulminant acute hepatitis, as well as chronic 
hepatitis in immunocompromised patients. No increased 
severity has been observed in the few cases reported dur￾ing pregnancy (4–8).
We report 2 infections acquired during pregnancy in 
immunocompetent women in France, neither of whom re￾ported having traveled abroad or eaten raw or undercooked 
pork. In accordance with hospital policy, patients were in￾formed at hospital admission of the potential use of their 
anonymized medical data for research purposes. 
The first case-patient was a 43-year-old woman, 
hospitalized at 39 weeks 2 days’ gestation, who had nausea, 
headache, and increased serum alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) (Figure). Hepatitis led to a cervical ripening and 
labor induction on the next day. At 39 weeks 5 days’ 
gestation, she delivered a 3,040-g healthy baby. We 
diagnosed maternal HEV infection at admission by 
detectable IgM and HEV RNA (5.75 log IU/mL), with a 
3c genotype. Maternal cytolysis decreased significantly 
after 2 days in the hospital (from 600 to 300 U/L); physical 
examination remained normal in the weeks after delivery, 
so no further biologic follow-up was performed. At birth, 
the baby had normal liver enzymes; HEV RNA in stools 
was negative twice at birth and at weeks 2 and 3. 
The second case-patient was a 38-year-old woman 
with intrauterine growth restriction found at 24 weeks’ ges￾tation. Increased ALT at 30 weeks’ gestation led to HEV 
diagnosis with detectable HEV IgM and viremia (2.98 log 
IU/mL). In retrospective testing, we detected HEV RNA in 
blood (2.37 log IU/mL) but not in the amniotic fluid at the 
time of amniocentesis (27 weeks’ gestation). HEV geno￾typing was unsuccessful. The patient’s liver abnormalities

Figure. Relationship of HEV RNA and alanine aminotransferase

resolved by 33 weeks’ gestation. We performed no fetal or 
neonatal monitoring. The woman delivered a low-weight 
(2,350-g) but otherwise healthy baby at 38 weeks’ gesta￾tion. The maternal physical examination remained normal 
in the weeks after delivery; we performed no further hepa￾titis follow-up. 
Both patients had nonspecific symptoms or 
asymptomatic ALT elevation despite acute HEV infections 
in the third trimester of pregnancy. The rapid decline in 
ALT suggested a rapid clearance of infection in both. The 
lack of HEV RNA in the feces of 1 newborn indicated that 
infection was not transmitted; the lack of detectable RNA 
in the amniotic fluid suggested the same in the second case. 
We cannot rule out fetal HEV infection in patient 2 after 27 
weeks’ gestation, even though such an infection is unlikely 
because both children were born healthy. These mild 
courses of illness are similar to previous reported outcomes 
involving HEV genotype 3 (4,5,7,8) but dissimilar to the 
findings of a retrospective case series from Israel (6). 
That study reported significant illness in 8 autochthonous 
cases: indeed, all but 1 case required hospitalization (from 
1 week to 2 months in duration), and fulminant hepatitis 
was described in 2 postpartum cases. HEV genotyping 
was not available in this study. Poor outcomes, including 
spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and premature delivery, 
have been related to impaired maternal immune and 
hormonal responses but have been limited to genotype 1. 
Genotype 1 replication has been shown in human placenta 
(9), which suggests a major role of the viral genotype in 
pathogenesis. This replication may account for the high rates 
of mother‐to‐child transmission and poor fetal outcomes in 
highly HEV-endemic areas. Recently, HEV infection in a 
rabbit model also demonstrated vertical transmission (10). 
However, rabbit HEV is a distant member of genotype 
3 that causes only partial cross-species infections in 
nonhuman primates; thus, pathogenesis could be different 
for this specific HEV genotype 3 variant. We observed no 
mother-to-child transmission in the 2 cases we describe.
HEV infection among pregnant women in industrialized 
countries is rarely reported, perhaps because it is rare in 
this setting, or infection may be underdiagnosed because 
symptoms are mild or nonspecific. Indeed, no acute 
infection or seroconversions were observed among pregnant 
women in a prospective study in France (11). The cases we 
report further suggest that no maternal, fetal, or neonatal 
complications occur following HEV genotype 3 infection.
