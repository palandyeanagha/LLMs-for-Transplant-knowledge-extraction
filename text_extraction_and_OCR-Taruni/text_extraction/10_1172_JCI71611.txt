Lymphatic vessels and tertiary lymphoid organs
Nancy H. Ruddle
Yale University School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.
Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) are accumulations of lymphoid cells in chronic inflammation that resemble LNs 
in their cellular content and organization, high endothelial venules, and lymphatic vessels (LVs). Although acute 
inflammation can result in defective LVs, TLO LVs appear to function normally in that they drain fluid and trans￾port cells that respond to chemokines and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) gradients. Molecular regulation of TLO 
LVs differs from lymphangiogenesis in ontogeny with a dependence on cytokines and hematopoietic cells. Ongoing 
work to elucidate the function and molecular regulation of LVs in TLOs is providing insight into therapies for con￾ditions as diverse as lymphedema, autoimmunity, and cancer.
Introduction
Lymphatic vessels (LVs) are a series of LYVE1+/PROX1+ vessels 
throughout the body that function in multiple physiologic and 
pathophysiologic processes. The initial thin-walled vessels, called 
capillaries, progress to collecting vessels and then to larger vessels 
such as the thoracic duct. LVs also express gp38 (podoplanin), 
VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, neuropilin-2, angiopoietin-1, and CCL21, 
although differences in levels of these markers exist between the 
different vessels. Although other cell types can express some of 
these markers, none except LVs express the entire range. PROX1 
is crucial for development and maintenance of LVs (1); VEGF 
receptors, especially VEGFR-3, respond to VEGF-C and VEGF-D 
and induce growth of already existing LVs (2). Fluid is transported 
through the LVs by means of extrinsic contraction of tissue forces 
and intrinsic pumping through lymphatic muscle (3). Lymphatic 
valves prevent backflow and have higher expression of PROX1 than 
do the cells in the walls of the vessels.
LVs have many functions in homeostasis. They maintain fluid 
balance, preventing edema by providing drainage of interstitial 
fluid, provide lipid transport, and serve in an immune capacity 
by carrying antigen and cells throughout the immune system and 
regulating this transport through production of chemokines and 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (4). LVs are also found at sites of 
chronic inflammation, referred to as ectopic or tertiary lymphoid 
organs (TLOs). This Review considers how closely the functions 
and regulation of LVs in TLOs resemble those throughout the 
body, particularly in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs).
SLOs
SLOs (LNs, Peyer’s patches, spleen, tonsils), which are positioned 
to provide optimal interactions of components of the immune 
system with invading pathogens, are remarkably organized with 
T and B cell compartmentalization, APCs, stromal cells, and blood 
and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Cells are directed to their 
various locations through the activity of chemokines produced by 
several different types of stromal cells — fibroblast reticular cells, 
marginal reticular cells, and endothelial cells (5). Naive cells enter 
LNs through specialized blood vessels, called high endothelial ven￾ules (HEVs), and leave after interaction with antigen, which enters 
into LNs via LVs. Conduits are very fine microvessels consisting of 
ECM scaffolding produced by fibroblast reticular cells. They trans￾port low-molecular-weight antigens from the cortex to the para￾cortex and into the parenchyma of LNs, where they can contact 
the HEVs (6). The organization of LNs and their vascular features 
are presented in Figure 1.
The signals that organize LNs in ontogeny are tightly regulated, 
which results in the development of individual LNs on a precise 
temporal and anatomical schedule (7). Members of the lympho￾toxin family (LTα3 and LTα1β2) play key roles in generating and 
maintaining lymphoid organs (8, 9) through their production by 
IL-7R+CD4+CD3– lymphoid tissue inducer cells. Lymphoid tissue 
inducer cells interact with cells of mesenchymal origin, called lym￾phoid tissue organizer cells, which produce chemokines that in 
turn induce more LTαβ. The role of stromal cells in SLO develop￾ment and maintenance is becoming better understood (10) as is 
the response of these cells to neuronal signals, including retinoic 
acid (11). HEVs are also key organizers of LN development (12), in 
that they express LTβR (13), respond to LTαβ (14, 15), and present 
chemokines and adhesion molecules
Functions of LVs in SLOs
Afferent LVs bring antigen and APCs to LNs. DCs accumulate in 
the subcapsular sinus and transmigrate through the floor of that 
sinus into the T cell zone, while T cells access the parenchyma of 
the LN through the peripheral medullary sinuses (16). Efferent 
LVs drain activated cells from the LN, which then travel through 
afferent vessels to the next LN in the series, into the thoracic duct, 
and into the bloodstream via the subclavian veins. Markers that 
distinguish efferent from afferent vessels are not yet known.
Cellular trafficking between the periphery and within LNs is reg￾ulated by the lymphoid chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL13 
and by S1P (17). CCL21 is produced or expressed in LNs by stromal 
cells, HEVs, and LECs. CCR7, the ligand for CCL19 and CCL21, is 
found on DCs and naive and memory T cells in the blood and is 
downregulated as they enter into the parenchyma of the LNs. S1P 
is found in high concentrations in the blood and lymph, where 
lymphocytes express low levels of the receptor, S1PR1. The receptor 
is re-expressed at higher levels in the LN, where S1P levels are low. 
Egress of S1P1R-expressing activated and memory cells from LNs is 
regulated by the high concentration of S1P in the lymph (ref. 17 and 
summarized in ref. 18). Thus, LVs play crucial roles in trafficking in 
LNs via activation and the expression of chemokines and S1P.
Additional potential functions of LVs in LNs include a role in 
tolerance, as they express self-antigen under the control of AIRE 
for presentation to T cells (19). LVs may also serve as organizers of 
LNs in the same manner as HEVs. Conditional inducible knock￾outs regulated by PROX1 will provide insight into this question.

TLOs
TLOs, also referred to as ectopic lymphoid tissues, are accumula￾tions of cells in chronic inflammation (reviewed in ref. 20) and are 
referred to as tertiary to distinguish them from SLOs. SLOs arise 
during development at key locations in the body under the control 
of a precise developmental program, but chronic immune activity 
in the adult can give rise to similarly organized accumulations of 
lymphoid cells in almost any non-lymphoid tissue through a pro￾cess that is not preprogrammed but rather the result of induction 
by factors in the environment that could elicit the same signals 
that contribute to LN development (reviewed in refs. 20, 21). TLOs 
are characterized by their cellular, organizational, chemokine, and 
vascular similarity to SLOs, especially LNs. These similarities 
include T and B cell compartmentalization, APCs such as DCs and 
follicular DCs, stromal cells (5), conduits, and a highly organized 
vascular system of HEVs and LVs (see below) (5, 22, 23). Common 
features of TLOs and LNs are depicted in Figure 1.
It has been suggested that TLOs differ from SLOs by the absence 
of a capsule; however, TLOs in a variety of chronic kidney diseases 
are in contact with a fibrous capsule (24). The absence of a cap￾sule may reflect the manner in which TLOs arise, compared with 
LNs. As noted above, the latter arise at predefined locations as a 
result of stromal and endothelial organizers. Even though most of 
these elements are also present in TLOs (5), the order in which they 
populate the TLO may differ from the precise temporal aspect of 
LNs. The general absence of a capsule may have consequences for 
trafficking patterns that could differ in TLOs from what is seen in 
LNs, in which the DCs and T cells migrate through the peripheral 
medullary sinus to the parenchyma (16).
TLOs arise in several instances of chronic inflammation, 
including autoimmunity, chronic graft rejection, persistent 
infection (summarized in ref. 20), atherosclerosis (25), and 
cancer (26–28). They can be induced experimentally by tissue￾specific expression of certain inflammatory mediators (summa￾rized in ref. 20), including members of the lymphotoxin family 
(15, 29), the very cytokines that are crucial for lymphoid organ 
development and maintenance (8).
As noted above, lymphoid chemokines regulate trafficking of 
lymphocytes and DCs to and within LNs, and their expression 
(20, 30) is one criterion that defines TLOs. Chemokines play sim￾ilar roles in LNs and ectopic lymphoid accumulations, since the 
CCR7-expressing T cells and DCs are situated in the same locality 
as CCL19 and CCL21 and the CXCR5+ B cells are in regions with 
high CXCL13 levels. TLOs likely function as local sites of anti￾gen presentation and lymphocyte activation, including somatic 
hypermutation and class switching in B cells (31), which suggests 
that they facilitate local antimicrobial responses as well as epitope 
spreading (32, 33) and autoimmune exacerbation.
TLOs can progress from a relatively benign to a destructive 
phase and lose their lymphoid organ characteristics. For example, 
in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM), initial pancreatic infiltrates are characterized 
by HEV development and minimal islet destruction, whereas later 
stages demonstrate frank islet destruction and diabetes (34). In 
this model, pancreatic TLOs disappear after removal of the β cell 
antigen and are replaced by tissue fibroblasts. The presence of high 
proportions of regulatory T cells in some TLOs (25, 35) suggests 
that immune regulation occurs in these locations.
Functions of LVs in TLOs
Thin-walled vessels with typical lymphatic markers, including 
LYVE1 and PROX1, are apparent in the TLOs arising in both clin￾ical settings (autoimmune disease and chronic graft rejection) and 
experimental models (summarized in ref. 20) (23, 25, 36–40). They 
are also found in TLOs associated with some tumors (35). The func￾tions of the LVs in TLOs have not been thoroughly investigated but

are worthy of analysis with regard to fluid balance and transport of 
antigen and naive, activated, and memory lymphocytes.
Fluid balance is a critical function of LVs in the body. Although 
production of IL-7 and IL-7Rα by afferent LVs is crucial with 
regard to fluid drainage in the skin during acute inflammation 
(41), this has not been investigated with regard to the chronic 
inflammation of TLOs. Since edema is a frequent occurrence in 
acute inflammation, it is likely that LVs associated with that pro￾cess serve a drainage function. Lymphangiogenesis accompanies 
acute inflammation with enhanced lymph flow (42). Seeger and 
colleagues suggest that inflammation occurs before lymphangio￾genesis and gives rise to that process (43). Lymphangiogenesis at 
early times after immunization or during acute inflammation 
may be the result of the presence of excess fluid, but the LVs are 
unable to transport APCs (13) due to defects in lymphatic con￾traction (44). Thaunat and colleagues have suggested that the 
existence of edema in an injured tissue results in an insufficient 
lymphatic outflow that then gives rise to chronic inflammation at 
the local site (45). They suggest that defective lymphatic drainage 
is a prerequisite for the development of TLOs and have provided 
data supporting this concept in chronic graft rejection. Once the 
TLO has developed, the LVs may function normally and provide 
fluid balance. Techniques to measure fluid accumulation are 
available (46) but have not been employed in the local region of 
a TLO. Future research could take advantage of measurements of 
interstitial fluid pressure in the local vicinity of a TLO to evaluate 
whether edema occurs and the LVs are functional. This may be 
more feasible and meaningful in a clinical setting, in which a rela￾tively accessible TLO such as the joint in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
provides a logical study site.
Do TLO LVs transport soluble or cell-associated antigen as they 
do in LNs? Perhaps this is a moot point, because in contrast to 
SLOs, the antigen is continuously locally available in TLOs. For 
example, proteins such as insulin in the pancreatic islet are in 
immediate proximity to or even a part of the TLO in T1DM. Thus, 
the necessity for antigen transport to the TLO through an exten￾sive LV system might not be necessary, and the LVs may not serve 
that function. The presentation of self-antigen in LNs (19) that 
has been suggested as a mechanism for self-tolerance has not been 
investigated in TLOs and is an important area for future research.
LVs transport cells to primary LNs and then to downstream LNs. 
Is there such a cellular transport function for TLO-associated LVs, 
in which cells travel to and from the LNs? LVs that are packed with 
lymphocytes are prominent in some TLOs (ref. 36 and Figure 2), 
which suggests that they do transport lymphocytes. Additional 
evidence supporting an afferent function for TLO LVs comes 
from the study of myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disease 
characterized by thymic TLOs with HEVs and B cell follicles. HEVs 
are the normal entry points for lymphocytes from the circulation 
into the LN parenchyma, but in this particular case, the HEVs are 
negative for CCL21, suggesting that it could be difficult for CCR7+
cells to enter through their usual (HEV) route. In most humans, 
thymic LVs do not normally express CCL21, but in patients with 
MG, thymic PROX1+VEGFR-3+ vessels do express this chemokine 
(47). Because B and T cells in this instance express CCR7 and naive 
B cells migrate across a CCL21 gradient, the authors suggest that 
although the thymus does not normally contain afferent LVs, in 
this pathologic TLO, the LVs function in that capacity and con￾tribute to thymic hyperplasia. In the early stages of non-obese dia￾betes, the infiltrates exhibit the characteristics of TLOs, includ￾ing HEVs and LVs (23, 48, 49), T and B cells, and macrophages. 
CCL21 is expressed on such LVs and is reduced upon treatment 
with complete Freund’s adjuvant (49), as is the lymphocytic infil￾tration, which again suggests that the CCL21-expressing LVs act 
as afferent vessels into the TLOs.
TLO-associated LVs may also function in an efferent capacity 
by transporting activated lymphocytes to the periphery. CCL21 
is a crucial chemokine for the traffic of LV-resident DCs to LNs; 
therefore, the presence of CCL21+ LVs in TLOs would support 
the idea that they can serve to transport CCR7+ DCs and lym￾phocytes. Indeed, there are several examples of CCL21 expres￾sion by TLO-associated LVs in humans with RA, Crohn’s disease, 
Sjögren’s syndrome, lichen planus (50), and chronic allograft 
rejection (51) and in the TLOs of pancreatic infiltrates in NOD 
(23) and RIPLTα mice (30).
Support for the idea that LVs in TLOs serve an efferent func￾tion comes from the observation that continual administration 
of FTY720, an S1P receptor agonist that blocks lymphocyte egress 
from LNs (52), prevents diabetes in NOD mice (53). This is only 
effective if the mice have already developed pancreatic TLOs (23). 
Treatment results in additional accumulation of lymphocytes in 
the pancreatic TLOs, which is reversed upon cessation, resulting in 
rapid islet destruction and diabetes (23, 54). These data suggest that 
lymphocyte trafficking through LVs in TLOs in NOD mice occurs 
under the control of the lymph S1P gradient and re-expression of 
its receptor by T cells, as occurs in LNs. These data are also consis￾tent with the observation that FTY720 also prevents egress from 
inflamed tissues into afferent lymphatics (55, 56) and raise the excit￾ing possibility that inhibitors of LV function could prevent diabetes 
and other autoimmune diseases systemically by preventing traffick￾ing from the TLO to the LNs. It is not known whether the LVs in 
TLOs produce S1P as they do in the rest of the body (4).
Regulation of LVs in TLOs
During ontogeny, LVs develop after the embryonic blood vessels 
have formed, sprouting from the cardinal vein (57). These events 
are orchestrated by products of the homeobox genes (SOX18 and 
PROX1) and growth factors and their receptors (VEGF-C and 
VEGFR-3) and require platelets (ref. 58 and reviewed in ref. 59). The 
involvement of additional cell types is suggested by the existence of 
lymphangioblasts, which are distinct from blood endothelial cells, 
in developing tadpoles (60). Studies in chickens (61, 62) and mice 
(63–65) support a role for mesodermal cells that express macro￾phage and lymphatic markers that become, integrate into, or sup￾port LVs through their production of VEGFs.
Regulation of lymphangiogenesis in TLOs is poorly understood. 
It is not known whether LVs precede the cellular accumulations 
and organization into TLOs. Since LVs produce the lymphoid 
chemokine CCL21, it is possible that they are among the stromal 
organizers of LNs and TLOs. This is consistent with the role that 
HEVs play in LNs (12) and presumably in TLOs, since HEVs are 
similarly, if not identically, regulated in those sites (15). Data from 
doxycycline-induced TLOs in RIPLTα mice indicate that the pres￾ence of LVs is a very early event that can occur prior to apparent 
leukocytic infiltration into the affected organ (37) and that occurs 
in the absence of obvious edema. Angiogenesis occurs in inflam￾mation and platelets are present, which indicates that the impor￾tant players in embryonic lymphangiogenesis may participate. 
Thus, the possibility, though remote, exists that a recapitulation 
of the developmental program could occur — that is, that LVs in

inflammation could arise from veins as they do in development. 
The presence of vessels that express markers of HEVs and LVs in 
the inflamed LN supports this scenario (13). On the other hand, 
the presence of blood vessels and their nearby LVs in TLOs sug￾gests that lymphangiogenesis in inflammation occurs by sprout￾ing from existing LVs. But what are the cells that signal these 
events? DCs, macrophages, and T and B cells have been implicated 
in the regulation of LVs in acute inflammation (13, 66–68). More 
recently, neutrophils have also been proposed to increase bioavail￾ability of VEGF-A and to produce VEGF-D (69). Different cells 
may be important at different times in various tissues. For exam￾ple, B cells appear to be important in the lymphangiogenesis that 
occurs in LNs during inflammation, but only at the early stages 
after immunization (13, 69).
The participation of macrophages in lymphangiogenesis in 
acute inflammation has been well documented, although the pre￾cise nature of their role is a subject of considerable controversy. 
Data in a model of corneal transplant lymphangiogenesis sug￾gest that macrophages can actually transdifferentiate into LECs 
(70); that is, that macrophages themselves are precursors to LECs 
(61, 62, 64, 71). The expression of LYVE1 by macrophages could be 
interpreted as evidence that this is the case. On the other hand, the 
expression of this marker on both cell types may be a red herring. 
The presence of additional LV markers such as PROX1 would go 
some way toward resolving this issue.
The well-known capacity of macrophages to produce growth 
factors, such as VEGF-C, VEGF-A, VEGF-D, PDGF, and adre￾nomedullin (summarized in ref. 72) suggests that it is likely that 
these cells contribute indirectly. Macrophages produce TNF-α, 
which has been implicated in lymphangiogenesis in a model of 
acute Mycoplasma pulmonis lung infection (73), which also supports 
an indirect mechanism for the functions of macrophages in LVs 
rather than direct transdifferentiation. Kerjaschki and colleagues 
demonstrated the presence of host bone marrow–derived precur￾sors in association with LVs in the TLOs of chronically rejecting 
kidneys (39). Osteoclast precursors, which include cells with mac￾rophage properties, participate in lymphangiogenesis in a model 
of TNF transgene– and serum-mediated RA (74). During low-dose, 
streptozotocin-induced pancreatic inflammation, there is a marked 
increase in macrophages in and around the islets. One population 
produces VEGF-C, and another LYVE1+ population appears to 
integrate or differentiate into LECs (75). As in ontogeny or acute 
inflammation, it is unclear whether macrophages differentiate into 
LECs, integrate into LVs, and/or produce growth factors in TLOs. 
Lineage-tracing experiments might resolve this controversy.
Cytokines contribute to lymphangiogenesis in acute inflamma￾tion, although there have been few studies evaluating their roles in 
the chronic inflammation–associated TLOs. The question of LT 
participation is of particular interest given both its crucial role in 
lymphoid organ development and its ability to induce TLOs. LTα
appears to play a minor, but real, role in lymphangiogenesis in 
development, as Lta–/– mice exhibit somewhat diminished LV func￾tion (37). Both LTα and TNF-α contribute to lymphangiogenesis 
in acute inflammation in M. pulmonis infection (37, 73). LTα also 
participates in acute lymphangiogenesis in the skin (37). LVs are 
induced in TLOs of RIPLTα mice. In this case, lymphangiogenesis

that the LVs are filled with lymphocytes, which indicates that transport 
of these cells is occurring and, thus, suggests that these LVs possess

occurs in the absence of LTβ (37). On the other hand, in a model 
of CXCL13-induced thyroid TLO, LVs are inhibited by treatment 
with LTβR-Ig (38), implicating the LTαβ complex. Further experi￾mentation in spontaneous TLOs, such as Sjögren’s syndrome, RA, 
and T1DM may reveal which cytokines, in addition to the TNF 
family, contribute to this process, whether the classical or alter￾native NF-κB pathways are involved, and whether these effects 
directly modulate LVs and/or are mediated indirectly through 
their induction of infiltrating cells that produce growth factors 
such as VEGF-C or VEGF-D.
The plasticity of LVs is a reflection of their environment, which 
influences their function, especially in the case of inflammation. 
CCL21 is particularly sensitive to inflammation. The low level of 
CCL21 protein on mouse dermal LVs is increased in explanted 
TNF-α–treated skin or oxazolone-induced contact sensitivity 
(76). TNF-α treatment of human dermal LECs results in increased 
CCL21 mRNA transcription, translation, and cell surface pro￾tein expression (76). As noted above, CCL21 expression becomes 
detectable on LVs in the thymus of TLOs in patients with MG (47). 
Immunofluorescence and microarray studies that compare LECs 
from acutely inflamed and resting mouse skin reveal increased 
expression of CCL21 and several other inflammatory genes (77). 
Interestingly, there is downregulation of other genes, including 
Vegfr3 and Prox1. Extension of these studies to LVs in TLOs may 
reveal differences due to the chronic nature of stimulation, and 
data from a mouse corneal model of recurrent inflammation sug￾gest that this is the case (78). The authors suggest that, in chronic 
inflammation, LVs retain memory in their accelerated develop￾ment of a network of functional LVs (78). The ability to isolate LVs 
on the basis of their antigen expression (77) or transgene induced 
fluorescence (79) will allow their molecular analysis and compari￾son to vessels from resting LNs, activated LNs, and TLOs.
Future research directions
The functions of LVs in TLOs may be revealed by a detailed molec￾ular signature. Are there are differences in gene expression between 
afferent and efferent LVs in LNs, and is this reflected in different 
LVs in TLOs? As noted above, new techniques allowing isolation, 
purification, and single-cell in situ analysis will provide the tools 
for determination of gene expression. Are there any genes that are 
differentially expressed in LVs from TLOs compared with those 
in the rest of the body? If so, it will be possible to preferentially 
affect those vessels with inhibitors of their function while leaving 
remaining LVs intact.
Analysis of lymphocyte, DC, and antigen-trafficking patterns 
in TLOs in real time in vivo is now possible with the use of mice 
that express fluorescent markers for HEVs (80) and LVs (79, 81). 
Although the technique of in vivo imaging is well established for 
analysis of trafficking in LNs (82), addressing this issue in TLOs 
is a greater challenge. The key is to study TLOs in tissues that 
are amenable to these techniques, which will allow the evaluation 
of questions concerning LV insufficiency, memory, and plasticity 
in LVs in TLOs, and on a functional level, to determine whether 
valves and muscles occur in these vessels. The analysis of TLOs 
in mice whose LVs are conditionally deleted or induced through 
PROX1 regulation will provide information regarding the impor￾tance of fluid drainage functions of LVs in this context. Finally, 
the influence of the local environment on the LVs in TLOs in 
different organs must be analyzed. How do differences the local 
milieu of the pancreas compared with that of the digestive tract, 
salivary gland, or joint influence the LVs that arise in the TLOs 
in those organs during T1DM, inflammatory bowel disease, 
Sjögren’s syndrome, or RA?
Clinical implications
Elucidation of LV regulatory mechanisms in TLOs will contribute 
to the development of therapies to either promote or inhibit their 
formation, but we must keep in mind that LVs may be beneficial 
or detrimental depending on their context. The following sections 
discuss the implications of LV modulation in autoimmunity, 
cancer, and fluid balance/lymphedema.
Autoimmunity. Inhibition of TLO LVs may be beneficial in auto￾immunity, since they contribute to exacerbation by epitope spread￾ing; this could occur through their transport of naive lymphocytes 
and APCs to the local site. Treatments that discourage LV develop￾ment, such as inhibition of macrophages (clodronate), cytokines 
(antibodies or receptor blockers), and growth factors (e.g., VEGFs) 
or those agents that inhibit function, such as the S1P1 receptor 
agonist FTY720, could be beneficial. The identification of mark￾ers preferentially expressed or expressed at a high level on TLO 
LVs would allow for their preferential inhibition. Inhibition of LV 
function might be protective in MG. LVs most likely contribute 
to priming by bringing naive lymphocytes into the thymic TLOs, 
thus leading to sensitization to the nicotinic AChR and patho￾genic antibodies to that antigen.
One must be cautious about the possibility that wide-scale 
inhibition of LVs might result in disastrous lymphedema. Thus, 
the goal should be targeted delivery to the TLO by vehicles 
such as nanoparticles (83, 84) that could deliver LV inhibitors 
(e.g., VEGFR-3–targeted antibodies) at the selected site. One can 
envision induced temporary perturbations of LV function while 
leaving the main beneficial functions intact. This will be possible 
as more information becomes available regarding the special prop￾erties and regulation of LVs in TLOs.
Cancer. Lymphangiogenesis occurs in many human tumors 
(summarized in ref. 85), and an enormous literature empha￾sizes a detrimental role for LVs as contributors to metastasis. A 
logical approach to inhibiting this spread would be the use of 
lymphangiogenesis inhibitors (85). A summary of the actual 
agents that are in clinical use for this purpose is presented in a 
recent review article (86). As noted above, the hazards of such 
approaches can lead to unintended lymphedema.
It may be time to rethink the approach of inhibiting LVs in can￾cer, as they may contribute to defense in some cancers. TLOs are 
clearly beneficial in some cancers, particularly if there is a gener￾ous component of HEVs (28). The interpretation of these data is 
that the TLO serves as a site of priming of naïve cells that enter 
via the HEVs and become sensitized to the tumor antigens. Since 
the high number of HEVs also correlates with reduced metastases, 
we need to consider that the response generated in the tumor is 
effective elsewhere. Perhaps this occurs because memory cells leave 
the tumor TLO via LVs, and the activated cells traffic throughout 
the body and seek out metastatic disease. Thus, in this context, 
the LVs in tumor TLOs are beneficial, as they serve as an exit for 
activated lymphocytes. It might be of benefit to encourage the 
development of LVs in this context (28).
Lymphedema. Engineering artificial TLOs may be of benefit in 
counteracting the effects of lymphedema. LVs in TLOs most likely 
contribute to fluid balance; understanding the roles of cytokines

encourage lymphangiogenesis and fluid drainage in situations 
where the LVs are defective. It has been estimated that 140–250 
million people worldwide suffer from this painful, disfiguring 
problem, which can be the result of an anatomical abnormality 
of LVs of genetic origin (primary lymphedema) or the result of 
damage or obstruction of LVs, due to cancer, cancer treatment 
(surgery or radiation), or infection (secondary lymphedema). The 
use of inflammation-induced LVs might be beneficial in these 
situations. However, as noted above, the lymphangiogenesis that 
initially occurs in acute inflammation can result in defective LVs 
(44); therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that generate 
and maintain functional, mature, LVs.
Conclusions
The secrets of LVs are being rapidly revealed, but there is much 
to be learned. Their existence in TLOs adds to the complexity 
and excitement in this emerging field. Major questions remain 
concerning LVs in general and in TLOs in particular. The pres￾ence of LVs in TLOs has been well documented, and evidence for 
their functions has been explored. Methods, particularly imag￾ing techniques, to further probe the functions of LVs in LNs and 
TLOs are available and continually improving. The regulation of 
lymphangiogenesis in TLOs remains a fertile area of research and 
is of key importance for the prophylaxis and treatment of autoim￾munity, cancer, and lymphedema.
