Abstract
Aims: Liver dysfunction due to heart failure (HF) is often referred to as cardiac or congestive hepatopathy. The composite
Model for End-Stage Liver Disease excluding INR (MELD-XI) is a robust scoring system of liver function, and a high score is
associated with poor prognosis in advanced HF patients with a heart transplantation and/or ventricular assist device.
However, the impact of MELD-XI on the prognosis of HF patients in general remains unclear.
Methods and Results: We retrospectively analyzed 562 patients who were admitted to our hospital for the treatment of
decompensated HF. A MELD-XI score was graded, and patients were divided into two groups based on the median value of
MELD-XI score: Group L (MELD-XI ,10, n = 289) and Group H (MELD-XI $10, n = 273). We compared all-cause mortality and
echocardiographic findings between the two groups. In the follow-up period (mean 471 days), 104 deaths (62 cardiac
deaths and 42 non-cardiac deaths) were observed. The event (cardiac death, non-cardiac death, all-cause death)-free rate
was significantly higher in group L than in group H (logrank P,0.05, respectively). In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, a
high MELD-XI score was found to be an independent predictor of cardiac deaths and all-cause mortality in HF patients.
Regarding echocardiographic parameters, right atrial and ventricular areas, inferior vena cava diameter, and systolic
pulmonary artery pressure were higher in group H than in group L (P,0.05, respectively).
Conclusions: The MELD-XI scoring system, a marker of liver function, can identify high-risk patients with right heart volume
overload, higher pulmonary arterial pressure and multiple organ failure associated with HF.

Introduction
Liver dysfunction often exists in heart failure (HF) as cardiac
or congestive hepatopathy, and is associated with adverse
clinical outcomes in advanced HF patients. [1–5] Cardio￾hepatic syndrome, a condition characterized by the develop￾ment of congestive hepatopathy and subsequent cirrhosis in
patients with advanced HF, has been recognized. [6] Recently,
the composite Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)
scoring series, with types such as MELD (including total
bilirubin, creatinine, prothrombin time-international ratio
(INR)), MELDNa (MELD with sodium), and MELD-XI
(MELD excluding INR) have been developed. They are
established scoring systems of liver or hepato-renal function,
and a high score is associated with poor prognosis, not only in
patients having undergone liver transplantation [7] but also
advanced HF considered heart transplantation and/or ven￾tricular assist device. [1,8–10] In HF patients, MELD scoring
series indicates multiple organ dysfunction secondary to
impaired cardiac function. It has been reported that MELD
scoring series were strong predictors for mortality than each
values alone (total bilirubin, creatinine, INR, sodium).[1] Since
HF patients often receive anticoagulant therapy, liver function
evaluation by MELD-XI seems to have results superior to an
MELD score. [10] A high MELD-XI score is associated with a
poor prognosis in HF patients who have had a heart
transplantation, and/or have a ventricular assist device. [1,8–
10] However, the impact of MELD-XI on the prognosis of
general HF patients remains unclear. On another note, right
ventricular systolic function, [11,12] and pulmonary arterial
pressure, [12,13] are the reported predictors of prognosis in
HF patients.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the
association of liver function (MELD-XI score) with 1) prognosis
(including cardiac, non-cardiac, and all-cause mortality) in general
HF patients, and 2) cardiac function (especially right heart
function).

MELD-XI Score Predicts Adverse Prognosis of Heart Failure

Framingham criteria. [14] Patients with acute coronary syndrome,
viral hepatitis, hepatic tumors, bile duct disease, end-stage kidney
disease and/or dialysis, pulmonary thromboembolism, and
primary pulmonary hypertension were excluded. Finally, we
analyzed 562 patients. Liver function was estimated by the
MELD-XI formula. As previously reported, MELD-XI was
calculated as: (5.116log (total bilirubin)+11.766log (creatinine)+
9.44); if variables with a value of ,1 were given the value of 1.
[10] These patients were divided into two groups based on the
median value of MELD-XI score in our study subjects: Group L
(MELD-XI ,10, n = 289) and Group H (MELD-XI $10, n =
273). We compared the clinical features and results from several
examinations of both groups, such as general laboratory tests and
echocardiography, performed upon hospital admission. Hyper￾tension was defined as the recent use of antihypertensive drugs, or
a systolic blood pressure $140 mmHg, and/or a diastolic pressure
$90 mmHg. Diabetes was defined as the recent use of insulin or
antidiabetic drugs, a fasting blood glucose value of $126 mg/dL,
and/or a hemoglobinA1c value of $6.5%. Dyslipidemia was
defined as the recent use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, a
triglyceride value of $150 mg/dL, a low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol value of $140 mg/dL, and/or a high-density lipopro￾tein cholesterol value of ,40 mg/dL. Estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) was measured by the Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease formula. [15] Anemia was defined as hemoglobin
of ,12.0 g/dl in females and ,13.0 g/dl in males. [16]
Pulmonary hypertension was defined as an estimated systolic
pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) $36 mmHg at rest in the
absence of pulmonary outflow obstruction by echocardiography.
[17] Patients were followed up for cardiac death, non-cardiac
death, and all-cause mortality. Non-cardiac death included death
due to stroke, respiratory failure, infection, sepsis, cancer, digestive
haemorrhage, and etc. Status and dates of deaths were obtained
from the patients’ medical records. If these data were unavailable,
status was ascertained by a telephone call to the patient’s referring
hospital physician. Written informed consent was obtained from
all study subjects. The study protocol was approved by the ethical
committee of Fukushima Medical University.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography was performed blindly by an experienced
echocardiographer using the standard techniques. Echocardio￾graphic parameters investigated included left ventricular (LV)
volume, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial volume,
the ratio of early transmitral flow velocity to mitral annular
velocity (mitral valve E/e’), inferior vena cava diameter, SPAP,
right atrial end systolic area, right ventricular (RV) area, right
ventricular fractional area change (RV-FAC), tissue Doppler￾derived tricuspid lateral annular systolic velocity (tricuspid valve
S’), and the ratio of the peak transtricuspid velocity during early
diastole to the peak tricuspid valve annular velocity during early
diastole (tricuspid valve E/e’), etc.[17] The LVEF was calculated
using a modification of the Simpson’s method. Mitral valve E/e’
was calculated by transmitral Doppler flow and tissue Doppler
imaging. SPAP was calculated by adding the right atrial pressure
(estimated by the diameter and collapsibility of the inferior vena
cava) to the systolic trans tricuspid pressure gradient. [12,17] The
RV-FAC, defined as (end diastolic area-end systolic area)/end
diastolic area x 100, is a measure of right ventricular systolic
function. [17] Tricuspid valve E/e’ was calculated by transtricus￾pid Doppler flow and tissue Doppler imaging. All recordings were
performed on ultrasound systems (ACUSON Sequoia, Siemens
Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA).

Statistical analysis
Normally distributed data are presented as mean 6 SD, non￾normally distributed data are presented as median (interquartile
range), and categorical variables are expressed as numbers and
percentages. Characteristics between the two groups were
compared using the independent Student’s t-test for normally
distributed data and the Mann-Whitney U- test for non-normally
distributed data, whereas the chi-square test was used for
categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier method was used for present￾ing the event-free rate and the logrank test was used for initial
comparisons. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional
hazard analyses were used to analyze predictors of events and
adjusting for confounding factors. To prepare for potential
confounding, we introduced the following factors, known to affect
the risk of worsening heart failure, cardiac death or all-cause
mortality in HF patients and parameters of liver function: age,
gender, systolic blood pressure, presence of ischemic etiology,
atrial fibrillation, anemia, reduced LVEF (,50%), and higher
(more than the median value of) BNP, aspartate aminotransferase,
alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, sodium, C￾reactive protein, and MELD-XI score. Univariate parameters with
a P-value of ,0.10 were included in the multivariate analysis. A
value of P , 0.05 was considered significant for all comparisons.
These analyses were performed using a statistical software package
(SPSS ver. 21.0, IBM, Armonk, NY).
Results
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, comparisons of clinical features
revealed that Group H had: 1) lower total protein, albumin, and
cholinesterase levels, 2) higher alkaline phosphatase and gamma￾glutamyl transferase levels, 3) larger right atrial and ventricular
areas, inferior vena cava diameter, SPAP, and tricuspid valve E/
e’, and 4) lower left ventricular ejection fraction. In contrast, RV
systolic function (RV-FAC, tricuspid valve S’) did not differ
between the two groups. In summary, Group H had poorer
nutrition, a higher cholestatic state, right heart volume overload,
higher pulmonary arterial pressure, and lower LV systolic
function.
During the follow-up period (mean 471 days), there were 62
cardiac deaths and 42 non-cardiac deaths. Details of cardiac and
non-cardiac deaths were as follows: heart failure deaths (n = 50),
ventricular fibrillation (n = 12), cancer (n = 12), respiratory failure
and/or pneumonia (n = 11), infection/sepsis (n = 6), stroke (n= 5),
digestive haemorrhage (n = 3), renal failure (n = 2), and others

(n = 3). As shown in Figure 1, the event (cardiac death, non-cardiac
death, all-cause mortality)-free rate was significantly lower in
Group H than in Group L (P,0.05, respectively).
To examine prognostic factors in HF patients, the Cox
proportional hazard model was used (Tables 3, 4, 5). With respect
to cardiac death in HF patients (Table 3), reduced LVEF (HR
2.234, 95% CI 1.142–4.371, P = 0.019), aspartate aminotransfer￾ase (HR 1.856, 95% CI 1.021–3.375, P = 0.043), and MELD-XI
(HR 2.052, 95% CI 1.085–3.879, P = 0.027) were independent
predictors. With respect to non-cardiac death in HF patients
(Table 4), MELD-XI was a predictor in univariate analysis,
however, MELD-XI was not an independent predictor in
mutivariate analysis. Age was an independent predictor for non￾cardiac death (HR 1.065, 95% CI 1.030–1.101, P,0.001). With
respect to all-cause mortality in HF patients (Table 5), age (HR
1.029, 95% CI 1.008–1.049, P = 0.005), reduced LVEF (HR
1.625, 95% CI 1.009–2.617, P = 0.046) and MELD-XI (HR
1.650, 95% CI 1.025–2.654, P = 0.036) were independent
predictors. In summary, a high MELD-XI score was an
independent predictor of cardiac death and all cause mortality.

MELD-XI Score Predicts Adverse Prognosis of Heart Failure

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to
show the utility of MELD-XI scores for predicting detailed cardiac
and non-cardiac deaths in general HF patients with regard to right
heart function. It was found that MELD-XI was an independent
predictor of cardiac death and all-cause mortality in general HF
patients, whose conditions were associated with right heart volume
overload and higher pulmonary arterial pressure.
HF results in a various abnormal liver functions, such as the
elevation of serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ganma￾glutamyl transferase, and alanine aminotransferase. The mecha￾nism possibly responsible for liver dysfunction in HF is considered
to be caused by hemodynamic influences: decreased hepatic blood
flow originating from low cardiac output and increased hepatic
venous pressure with subsequent atrophy of liver cells and edema
of the peripheral area, both leading to hepatocellular hypoxia. [18]
Previous hemodynamic data suggest that elevated central venous
pressure and right atrial pressure may contribute to cholestatic
abnormalities and impairment of hepatocyte function in patients
with HF. [19,20] Several metabolic processes of bilirubin,
including secretion of direct bilirubin into bile, [21] are attenuated
by hepatocellular hypoxia. In addition, biliary obstruction caused
by elevated hepatic venous pressure leads to an increase of serum
total bilirubin. Several studies so far have shown that serum
bilirubin correlates with various hemodynamic and cardiac
parameters, such as right atrial pressure, [19,22] severity of
tricuspid regurgitation, [19,22] pulmonary artery wedge pressure,
[5,19] cardiac output, [5,19] and LVEF. [22] In our study, HF
with a high MELD-XI score was accompanied by poorer
nutrition, cholestatic state, cardiac volume overload, and higher
pulmonary arterial pressure. In contrast, RV systolic function did
not differ between the two groups. It has been reported that RV
systolic dysfunction is a predictor of cardiac events in HF. [11,12]
In addition, elevated central venous pressure [23] and pulmonary
atrial pressure [12,13,24] are shown to be associated with an
adverse prognosis in HF. Reactive post capillary pulmonary
hypertension is a prognostic factor regardless of HF etiology or left
ventricular systolic function. [24] It seems that the prognostic
importance of MELD-XI score in our study, at least in part,
reflects the greater elevations in central venous pressure, cardiac
volume overload, and pulmonary hypertension.
Shinagawa et al. reported that high total bilirubin is an
independent predictor of cardiac events in HF patients. [5] It
has been reported that MELD and MELD-XI were independent
predictors of all-cause mortality in advanced HF patients (HF
patients after having received a ventricular assist device). [8,10]
Recently, it has been reported that MELD models were
independent predictors of all-cause mortality in advanced HF
patients (HF patients either considered for or having undergone
heart transplantation). [1,9] Our study differs from previous
studies [1,8–10] in many ways. For instance, we presented detailed
all-cause death in general HF patients who received no ventricular
assist device and/or heart transplantation. Importantly, we also
showed the association with right heart function.
Study limitations
Several limitations remain in the present study. First, it was a
retrospective analysis of a single institution. The number of
subjects was relatively small. Hence, prospective studies with a
larger population are needed. However, diagnosis of HF was
accurately made by our experienced cardiologists using the
Framingham criteria. Second, we evaluated RV function and
SPAP using echocardiography unless we used right heart
catheterization. However, this is not routinely performed.
Conclusions
A high MELD-XI score was an independent predictor of not
only cardiac death but also all-cause mortality in HF patients. HF
patients with high MELD-XI scores had 1) poorer nutrition, 2) a
greater cholestatic state, and 3) right heart volume overload and
higher pulmonary arterial pressure. These mechanisms may in
part affect the adverse prognosis of HF patients with high MELD￾XI scores.
