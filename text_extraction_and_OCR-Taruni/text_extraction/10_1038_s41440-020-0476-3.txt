Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the
cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)
pandemic. Mortality is mainly due to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) [1].
High blood pressure appeared to be an independent
factor for severity in patients with COVID-19 [2, 3].
The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is a hemodynamic
and biological system that regulates blood pressure, plasma
potassium, and the stability of pulmonary epithelial mem￾branes (Fig. 1) [4]. In this system, two antagonistic path￾ways are balanced. The first is the angiotensinogen pathway
that transforms angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (by
renin), and then converts it into angiotensin II by angio￾tensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II attaches
to angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and activates
the system to induce vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion
stimulation, hypokalemia, and pulmonary epithelium
degradation [5].
The second way in which the angiotensin system is
balanced involves a second angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE2) [6, 7]. This pathway transforms a part of angio￾tensin I [1–10] and angiotensin II [1–8] before it attaches to
its AT1R receptor. The angiotensin I and II phosphorylation
products are angiotensin 1–9 and angiotensin 1–7. They
attach to the angiotensin II type 2 receptor receiver, indu￾cing antagonist effects compared with AT1R [8].
In the infection phase (Fig. 2), COVID-19 virus uses the
enzymatic receptor of ACE2 to penetrate the host cell [9, 10].
Coronavirus binding with ACE2 has been shown to lead to a
downregulation of ACE2 [11], contributing to an increase in
angiotensin 2 through ACE, as the decrease in ACE2 results
in a lower conversion of angiotensin to angiotensin 1–7
vasodilator [12]. The lower the level of ACE2, the lesser
angiotensin I [1–10] and angiotensin II [1–8] will be degra￾ded; thus, their plasmatic concentration gradually increases.
A US intensive care unit team demonstrated that an increase
in angiotensin 1–10 and a decrease in angiotensin 1–9
(its ACE2 processing product) were correlated with a poor
prognosis in ARDS [1].
Thus, elevations in angiotensin II concentrations and
stimulation of AT1R lead to a decrease in the stability of the
pulmonary endothelium and an aggravation of respiratory
distress [13, 14]. The other effects are an increased secretion
of aldosterone, hypokalemia induced by kaliuresis, and
increased sodium reabsorption and inflammation [15].
Hypokalemia is frequently found in patients with COVID￾19. A Chinese team recently reported that hypokalemia was
associated with a poor outcome (Wuhan’s experience) [16].
Conversely, RAS blockers can increase ACE2 and
potentially promote virus loading into the cell [17].
We believe that major imbalance in RAS induced by
the downregulation of ACE2 is an essential element
of unfavorable evolution in patients with COVID-19.
The biological marker of this imbalance appears to be
hypokalemia.
Several studies in influenza and Ebola lung infections
have shown the beneficial role of AT1R blockers on lung
damage, with a decrease in inflammation and cytokines
[18–21]. In two animal studies, losartan demonstrated an
increase in ACE2 expression [22, 23].
Losartan was also the molecule chosen in two trials
recently started in the United States by the University of
Minnesota to treat patients with COVID-19 (clinical trials.
gov NCT04311177 and NCT 104312009). We began a
preliminary study to document the kinetics of RAS in
COVID+ patients (SAR-COV) before therapeutic evalua￾tion (ISRA-COV).

Clarification is needed to determine whether blockers of the
angiotensin system have a protective or harmful effect in these
patients [24]. In particular, we strongly need to evaluate how
blocking the overactivation of the RAS by an AT1R blocker
(such as losartan) in patients with COVID-19 could decrease
respiratory decompensation and hemodynamic disorders and
thus limit the number of patients with poor prognosis.
