INTRODUCTION
Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic
transplant nephropathy are defined by a
progressive functional deterioration of
the kidney that is associated with inter￾stitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and
glomerulosclerosis leading to late renal
allograft failure. Ischemia/reperfusion
injury (IRI) is an associated risk factor for
both AKI and chronic transplant neph -
ropathy. In vivo models of renal IRI have
extensively demonstrated the evolution
of AKI and the consequent long-term
chronic lesions that mimic those demon￾strated in chronic transplant nephropa￾thy (1). Two separate long-term retro￾spective outcome studies of patients
surviving AKI on discharge, with a me￾dian follow-up of 7.2 and 8 years, re￾vealed significant deterioration in renal
function that progressively leads to end￾stage renal disease in 19 and 37% of pa￾tients, respectively (2,3). During AKI, the
S3 segment of the proximal tubule and
the outer medullary thick ascending limb
of the nephron are subject to the most se￾vere injury, resulting in cell death. The
proximal tubule absorbs two-thirds of all
NaCl in the glomerular filtrate, and the
thick ascending limb is responsible for
Na+ reabsorption through several
sodium transporters, which allows the
loop of Henle to generate a high osmo￾larity to concentrate urine. Therefore,
fractional excretion of sodium together
with glomerular filtration rate is used to
monitor tubular as well as glomerular
function. Deterioration in both these
markers is indicative of AKI and has
been shown to change during the evolu￾tion of AKI (4). During the recovery
phase of AKI, viable nephrons undergo

In preclinical studies, erythropoietin (EPO) reduces ischemia-reperfusion–associated tissue injury (for example, stroke, myocar￾dial infarction, acute kidney injury, hemorrhagic shock and liver ischemia). It has been proposed that the erythropoietic effects of
EPO are mediated by the classic EPO receptor homodimer, whereas the tissue-protective effects are mediated by a hetero￾complex between the EPO receptor monomer and the β-common receptor (termed “tissue-protective receptor”). Here, we in￾vestigate the effects of a novel, selective-ligand of the tissue-protective receptor (pyroglutamate helix B surface peptide [pHBSP])
in a rodent model of acute kidney injury/dysfunction. Administration of pHBSP (10 μg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.] 6 h into reperfusion)
or EPO (1,000 IU/kg i.p. 4 h into reperfusion) to rats subjected to 30 min ischemia and 48 h reperfusion resulted in significant at￾tenuation of renal and tubular dysfunction. Both pHBSP and EPO enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (activation) and glyco￾gen synthase kinase 3β (inhibition) in the rat kidney after ischemia-reperfusion, resulting in prevention of the activation of nuclear
factor-κB (reduction in nuclear translocation of p65). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was en￾hanced by EPO and, to a much lesser extent, by pHBSP, suggesting that the signaling pathways activated by EPO and pHBSP may
not be identical.

hyperfiltration and hypertrophy that is
linked to the synthesis of cytokines and
growth factors to cause a systemic in￾flammatory response syndrome and ex￾tracellular matrix accumulation due to
the induction of transforming growth
factor-β (a key fibrogenic cytokine).
Therefore, therapeutic strategies that can
ameliorate AKI early may prevent the
later onset of end-stage renal disease.
Thus, patients have to be treated during
the early phases of the evolution of AKI.
Erythropoietin (EPO) is beneficial in
preclinical models of IRI including myo￾cardial infarction (5), hind-limb ischemia
(6), liver ischemia (7), AKI (8,9) and hem￾orrhagic shock (10), when given before
injury or at the onset of reperfusion.
Leist et al. (11) suggested that EPO medi￾ates tissue-protection through a receptor
(tissue-protective receptor) that is phar￾macologically distinct from the classic
EPO receptor that is known to mediate
erythropoiesis (11). The tissue-protective
receptor exhibits a lower affinity for
EPO, forms distinct molecular species in
cross-linking experiments (12) and is a
heteromer composed of the EPO receptor
and CD131 (the β-common receptor
[βcR]) (13). The βcR also forms receptor
complexes with the α receptor subunits
specific for granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), in￾terleukin (IL)-3 and IL-5 and hence has
been termed the “common” receptor
(14). We have recently discovered that (a)
the helix B of EPO has tissue-protective
properties that are similar to properties
of EPO, and (b) a peptide constructed to
mimic the external, aqueous surface of
EPO without primary sequence similar￾ity (pyroglutamate helix B surface pep￾tide [pHBSP]) mimics the tissue-protec￾tive effects of EPO in a mouse model of
renal IRI when given as multiple admin￾istrations in the course reperfusion (15).
The βcR plays an integrative role in
the EPO signaling-mediated activation of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
(16). eNOS is believed to be responsible
for the maintenance of physiological
renal hemodynamics and function (17).
During the early phase of reperfusion in￾jury, that is, the first 6 h, eNOS activation
is significantly attenuated, whereas the
inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS) is sig￾nificantly upregulated (18). We have pre￾viously shown that renal IRI is effec￾tively attenuated by genetic deletion or
pharmacological inhibition of iNOS (19).
During the later stages of reperfusion,
that is, by 24 h, eNOS activation is re￾stored back up to basal levels, whereas
iNOS expression continues to increase
(18). Surprisingly, ischemic precondition￾ing (18) or treatment with nitrite (20) in
models of renal IRI prevent the expres￾sion of iNOS and the decline in eNOS ac￾tivity caused by ischemia followed by
6 h of reperfusion. This finding suggests
that strategies that enhance eNOS (and
prevent iNOS expression) may protect
the kidney against IRI.
Therefore, we set out to investigate
whether a single, delayed administration
of either pHBSP or EPO (during the early
reperfusion period) reduces the tissue in￾jury and dysfunction caused by renal IRI.
Having discovered that the delayed ad￾ministration of EPO or pHBSP (4 or 6 h
after onset of reperfusion, respectively)
reduces glomerular and tubular dysfunc￾tion, we investigated (a) the effects of the
above interventions on disease-relevant
markers (including plasma clusterin and
osteopontin) and (b) signaling pathways
known to play key roles in tissue injury
and/or inflammation (including the
phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473, phos￾phorylation of glycogen synthase kinase
[GSK]-3β on Ser9
, phosphorylation of
eNOS on Ser1177, activation of p38 mito￾gen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
activation of nuclear factor [NF]-κB [mea￾sured as nuclear translocation of p65]).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The animal protocols followed in this
study were approved by the local Ani￾mal Use and Care Committee in accor￾dance with the derivatives of both the
Home Office Guidance on the operation of
the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986
(21) and the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Re￾search Council (22).
Surgical Procedure and
Quantification of Organ
Injury/Dysfunction
This study was carried out on 42 male
Wistar rats (Charles River, Margate, UK)
receiving a standard diet and water ad li￾bitum. Animals were anesthetized using
a ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine
(15 mg/kg) mixture (1.5 mL/kg in￾traperitoneally [i.p.]). The hair was
shaved and the skin was cleaned with
70% alcohol (v/v). The animals were then
placed on a homoeothermic blanket set at
37°C. Animals received 0.1 mg/kg subcu￾taneous buprenorphine (0.1 mL/kg) be￾fore commencing surgery. A midline la￾parotomy was then performed. The renal
pedicles (consisting of the renal artery,
vein and nerve) were isolated and
clamped using nontraumatic microvas￾cular clamps at time 0. After 30 min of
bilateral renal ischemia, the clamps were
removed to allow reperfusion for 48 h.
For reperfusion, the renal clamps were
removed and the kidneys were observed
for a further 5 min to ensure reflow, after
which 8 mL/kg saline at 37°C was in￾jected into the abdomen and all incisions
were sutured in two layers (Ethicon Pro￾lene 4-0). Animals were then allowed to
recover on the homothermic blanket and
placed into cages upon recovery. At 24 h
of reperfusion, rats were placed into
metabolic cages for the collection of
urine. At sacrifice (after 48 h of reperfu￾sion), blood was taken by cardiac punc￾ture into nonheparinized syringes and
immediately decanted into 1.3 mL serum
gel tubes (Sarstedt, Ltd., Leicester, UK).
The blood was centrifuged at 9,900g for 3
min to separate serum. All biochemical
markers in serum and urine were mea￾sured in a blinded fashion by a commer￾cial veterinary testing laboratory (IDEXX,
West Sussex, UK).
Experimental Design
Rats were randomly allocated into
the following groups: (a) Sham (n = 6);
(b) IRI (n = 11); (c) IRI + pHBSP (pHBSP,
10 μg/kg i.p., administered 6 h after the
onset of reperfusion, n = 11); and (d) IRI
+ EPO (EPO, 1,000 IU/kg i.p., adminis￾720 | PATEL ET AL. | MOL MED 18:719-727, 2012

tered 4 h after the onset of reperfusion,
n = 14). The volume of phosphate￾buffered saline (vehicle) administered
was equal to the volume of pHBSP or
EPO administered (1 mL/kg). Sham-
 operated rats underwent identical surgi￾cal procedures but without IRI. It was
previously shown that after an intraperi￾toneal administration of 1,000 IU/kg
EPO, peak plasma concentrations of EPO
were achieved 2 h later (23). As the peak
plasma concentration of pHBSP is
achieved at the time of administration,
that is, 6 h into reperfusion (15), EPO
was administered at 4 h into reperfusion
to achieve a peak plasma concentration
at 6 h into reperfusion.
Measurement of Serum Clusterin and
Osteopontin
Analysis for the kidney injury markers of
clusterin and osteopontin was carried out
using the Novagen® Widescreen® Rat Kidney
Toxicity Panel 2 on the Luminex® xMAP®
System per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blots were carried out as pre￾viously described (24). Three separate ex￾periments of Western blot analysis were
performed for each marker, and tissues
were done separately for each Western
blot experiment. Briefly, rat kidney sam￾ples were homogenized and centrifuged
at 4,000g for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatants
were removed and centrifuged at 15,000g
at 4°C for 40 min to obtain the cytosolic
fraction. The pelleted nuclei were resus￾pended in extraction buffer. The suspen￾sions were centrifuged at 15,000g for
20 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatants
containing nuclear proteins were care￾fully removed, and protein content was
determined using a bicinchoninic acid
protein assay following the manufac￾turer’s directions. Proteins were sepa￾rated by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS￾PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinyl -
denedifluoride membrane, which was
then incubated with a primary antibody
(rabbit anti-total GSK-3β, dilution 1:200;
goat anti-phospho GSK-3β Ser9 dilution
1:200; rabbit anti-total Akt dilution
1:1,000; mouse anti-phospho Akt Ser473
dilution 1:1,000; rabbit anti-total eNOS
dilution 1:200; goat anti-phospho eNOS
Ser1177 dilution 1:200; rabbit anti-NF-κB
p65 dilution 1:400; mouse anti-phospho
p38, dilution 1:1,000; rabbit anti-total p38
dilution 1:1,000). Blots were then incu￾bated with a secondary antibody conju￾gated with horseradish peroxidase (dilu￾tion 1:10,000) and developed using the
ECL detection system. The immunoreac￾tive bands were visualized by autoradi￾ography. The membranes were stripped
and incubated with β-actin monoclonal
antibody (dilution 1:5,000) and subse￾quently with an anti-mouse antibody (di￾lution 1:10,000) to assess gel-loading ho￾mogeneity. Densitometric analysis of the
bands was performed using Gel Pro®
Analyzer 4.5, 2000 software (Media Cy￾bernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA), and
optical density analysis was expressed as
the fold-increase versus the sham group.
In the sham group, the immunoreactive
bands of the gel were respectively mea￾sured and normalized against the first
immunoreactive band (standard sham
sample), and the results of all the bands
belonging to the same group were ex￾pressed as mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). The membranes were
stripped and incubated with β-actin
monoclonal antibody and subsequently
with an anti-mouse antibody to assess
gel-loading homogeneity. Relative band
intensity was assessed and normalized
against parallel β-actin expression. Each
group was then adjusted against corre￾sponding Sham data to establish relative
protein expression when compared with
Sham animals.
Materials
Unless otherwise stated, all com￾pounds used in this study were pur￾chased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole,
Dorset, UK). All stock solutions were
prepared using nonpyrogenic saline
(0.9 % [w/v] NaCl; Baxter Healthcare,
Thetford, Norfolk, UK). Ringer’s Lactate
was purchased from Baxter Healthcare.
Antibodies for Western blot analysis
were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany).
pHBSP was supplied by Araim Pharma￾ceuticals (Ossining, NY, USA). EPO was
supplied by the Barts and The London
Pharmacy.
Statistical Analysis
All values described in the text and fig￾ures are expressed as mean ± SEM for n
observations. Each data point represents
biochemical measurements obtained from
up to 14 separate animals. Statistical anal￾ysis was carried out using GraphPad
Prism 5.0d (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA, USA). Data without repeated
measurements was assessed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by Dunnett post hoc test. Data with re￾peated measurements were assessed by
two-way ANOVA followed by a Bonfer￾roni post hoc test. A P value of <0.05 was
considered significant.
RESULTS
Effect of pHBSP and EPO on Renal,
Glomerular and Tubular Dysfunction
When compared with sham-operated
rats, renal ischemia (30 min) and reperfu￾sion (48 h) caused significant increases in
serum creatinine, serum urea, creatinine
clearance and fractional excretion of
sodium (Figure 1). Rats were adminis￾tered 10 μg/kg pHBSP at 6 h into reper￾fusion after ischemia. Administration of
pHBSP to rats subjected to IRI caused an
attenuation in serum creatinine, serum
urea, creatinine clearance and fractional
excretion of sodium when compared
with rats subjected to IRI only (see
 Figure 1).
pHBSP has a half-life of ~2 min in the
rodent (15) and, hence, it was surprising
to see an effect after such a late adminis￾tration of 6 h in this model. Therefore,
we wanted to determine if EPO would
have a similar beneficial effect if given
late into reperfusion. EPO reaches peak
plasma concentrations 2 h after an in￾traperitoneal administration (23); there￾fore, rats were administered 1,000 IU/kg
EPO at 4 h into reperfusion after ische￾RESEARCH ARTICLE

mia. Administration of EPO to rats sub￾jected to IRI caused an attenuation in
serum creatinine, serum urea and frac￾tional excretion of sodium, with only a
small insignificant increase in creatinine
clearance when compared with rats sub￾jected to IRI only (see Figure 1).
Effect of pHBSP and EPO on Plasma
Biomarkers of Renal Injury
When compared with sham-operated
rats, renal ischemia (30 min) and reperfu￾sion (48 h) also caused significant in￾creases in plasma clusterin and osteopon￾tin (Figure 2). pHBSP significantly
attenuated the rise in clusterin and osteo￾pontin (see Figure 2) when compared
with rats subjected to IRI only. In contrast,
EPO did not attenuate the rise in osteo￾pontin (see Figure 2), but did attenuate
the rise in clusterin (see Figure 2) when
compared with rats subjected to IRI only.
Effect of pHBSP and EPO on the
Phosphorylation of Akt, GSK-3β, eNOS
and p38 in the Kidneys of Rats That
Underwent Renal IRI
To gain a better insight into the poten￾tial mechanism(s) underlying the ob￾served beneficial effects of pHBSP and
EPO, we investigated the effects of this
peptide on cell signaling pathways
known to confer tissue protection or to
inhibit inflammation in the kidney. When
compared with sham-operated rats, the
kidneys of rats subjected to IRI that had
been treated with vehicle showed small
(nonsignificant) decreases in the phos￾phorylation of Akt on Ser473 and GSK-3β
on Ser9 (Figures 3A, B). Treatment of IRI
rats with pHBSP or EPO resulted in a
substantial increase in the phosphoryla￾tion of Akt and GSK-3β to levels that
were significantly higher than levels
measured in sham-operated rats (see Fig￾ures 3A, B). The degree of phosphoryla￾tion of eNOS on Ser1177 was similar in
sham-operated rats and IRI rats treated
with vehicle, indicating that renal IRI did
not affect eNOS phosphorylation (Fig￾ure 3C). Treatment of IRI rats with
pHBSP resulted in a significant (~1-fold)
increase in the phosphorylation of eNOS
when compared with IRI rats treated
with vehicle alone (see Figure 3C). Inter￾estingly, treatment of IRI rats with EPO
also resulted in a significant, but larger
(approximately three-fold) increase in the
phosphorylation of eNOS when com￾pared with IRI rats treated with vehicle
alone (see Figure 3C). When compared
with sham-operated rats, IRI rats treated
with vehicle exhibited significant in￾creases in the phosphorylation of p38 in
the kidney (Figures 3D). Treatment of IRI
rats with pHBSP or EPO significantly at￾tenuated the degree of p38 phosphoryla￾tion in the kidney (see Figure 3D) when
compared with rats subjected to IRI only.
Effect of pHBSP and EPO on the
Nuclear Translocation of the p65
NF-κB Subunit in the Kidneys of Rats
That Underwent Renal IRI
When compared with sham-operated
rats, the kidneys of IRI rats treated with
vehicle exhibited significant increases in
the nuclear translocation of the p65
NF-κB subunit (Figure 4), indicating the
activation of NF-κB. Treatment of IRI rats
with pHBSP or EPO resulted in a signifi￾cant reduction in nuclear translocation of
p65 and, hence, the activation of NF-κB
in the kidney (see Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
Several molecular interaction studies
have identified the regions of EPO that
interact with the EPO receptor, which in￾clude portions of helices A and C, as well
as helix D and the loop connecting he￾lices A-B (25–28). Modification of the
amino acids of EPO within portions of
helices A and C or in the loop connecting
helices A-B abolishes the ability of EPO
to bind to its receptor, thus making these
modified EPOs nonerythropoietic in vivo
and in vitro. However, the most interest￾ing aspect of these EPO analogs is that
many are still able to demonstrate tissue-
 protective properties (11). Chemical
modification of lysine residues or amino
acid substitutions made within helices A
and C or in the loop connecting helices
A-B of EPO do not affect tissue protec￾tion, suggesting that other regions of
EPO may contain the recognition site(s)
for the βcR (see Introduction). The inter￾action of the hydrophobic content of the

[10 μg/kg pHBSP administered 6 h into reperfusion]); and IRI + EPO, n = 14 [1,000 IU/kg EPO

four α-helices of EPO constrain the mole￾cule into a compact, relatively rigid,
globular structure and, hence, give EPO
a well- defined tertiary structure in aque￾ous media. When EPO is bound to the
EPO receptor, helix B and parts of the
loops connecting helices A-B and C-D
face the aqueous medium, away from the
homodimer binding sites (Protein Data
Bank [PDB] ID code 1EER). These re￾gions do not contain lysine and, there￾fore, are not modified by carbamylation
of EPO, a procedure that produces a
 tissue-protective compound that is un￾able to bind to the classic EPO receptor
(11). Subsequent studies have since iden￾tified that the novel tissue-protective
peptide, pHBSP, can confer protection in
a number of disease models (29–37). The
interesting aspect of pHBSP is that it has
many of the pleiotropic effects of EPO. In
particular, pHBSP has been shown to ac￾celerate wound healing of punch biopsy
wounds in the rat (15).
Results from previous experiments
have shown that a peptide fragment of
EPO comprising the amino acid se￾quence corresponding to helix B exhib￾ited tissue-protective effects similar to
EPO and its nonerythropoietic deriva￾tives in a variety of in vitro and in vivo
models (15). In the same study, we
demonstrated a dose-dependent reno￾protective effect of pHBSP when admin￾istered at 1 min, 6 h and 12 h after the
onset of reperfusion after 30 min of renal
ischemia (15). The degree of protection
observed was similar to that of EPO pre￾viously reported in a murine model of
30 min renal ischemia and 24 h reperfu￾sion (9). We demonstrate here that a
single administration of pHBSP at 6 h
after the onset of reperfusion protects the
kidney from IRI and dysfunction. We
found that this delayed administration of
pHBSP attenuated the renal, glomerular
and tubular dysfunction and injury asso￾ciated with 30 min of ischemia and 48 h
of reperfusion. In rodents, maximal
plasma levels of EPO are achieved at 2 h
after a single intraperitoneal injection
(23). We show here that a single in￾traperitoneal injection of a moderate
dose of EPO (1,000 IU/kg) also caused a
pronounced reduction in renal IRI and
dysfunction, which was similar to the
one afforded by pHBSP. Thus, it appears
that the delayed administration (as late
as 6 h into the reperfusion period) of ei￾ther EPO or its nonerythropoietic analog
pHBSP dramatically improves the func￾tional recovery after IRI in the rat.
In recent years, clusterin and osteo￾pontin were used as biomarkers of kid￾ney injury (38). Clusterin is an ambigu￾ous protein with evidence supporting a
transport/chaperone role not too dissim￾ilar to that of heat shock proteins (39).
Although clusterin is ubiquitously ex￾pressed, an increased expression of clus￾terin is associated with injury to the
proximal tubular epithelium in human
renal diseases (40). In our rodent study,
we observed a significant rise in plasma
clusterin at 48 h after the onset of reper￾fusion. This rise in clusterin was abol￾ished when rats subjected to renal IRI
were treated with either pHBSP or EPO.
Osteopontin, which is found in numer￾ous organs including the bone, nervous
system and kidney, predominantly func￾tions to modulate nitric oxide (NO),
 regulate calcium, maintain bone and the
extracellular matrix, and maintain migra￾tion/adhesion of macrophages and lym￾phocytes (41). Kidney mRNA expression
of osteopontin is localized to the long
loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule,
proximal tubule and glomerular epithe￾lium, with increased gene expression oc￾curring after injury (42). There is some
evidence that suggests that osteopontin
is proinflammatory (43). In our study, the
rise in plasma osteopontin caused by IR
was attenuated by pHBSP but not EPO.
This result may suggest that pHBSP is
able to target tissue repair in areas of the
kidney not possible by EPO, such as the
distal tubular and glomerular epithe￾lium, which may explain the difference
in effect with respect to glomerular func￾tion.
There is some evidence that the benefi￾cial effects of pHBSP and/or EPO are
secondary to the activation of the sur￾vival kinase Akt (44,45). Akt is a member
of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signal
transduction enzyme family, which regu￾lates cellular activation, inflammatory re￾sponses, chemotaxis and apoptosis (46).
When phosphorylated by its upstream
regulator, phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase, Akt modulates cell survival and
growth (46). We report here that renal IRI
at 48 h of reperfusion results in a small
reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt
in the kidney. A reduction in the activa￾tion of this survival pathway, if biologi￾cally significant, will make organs more
susceptive to injury and inflammation
(47,48). Most notably, pHBSP and EPO
(when given 6 h into reperfusion) signifi￾cantly enhanced Akt phosphorylation (at
48 h) to levels that were significantly
higher than levels seen in sham-operated
rats. The enhanced activation of this im￾portant survival pathway should make

the kidney of animals treated with
pHBSP or EPO more resistant to injury.
Interestingly, both EPO and pHBSP also
enhance the phosphorylation of Akt in
cardiomyocytes subjected to tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α (29).
GSK-3β is a serine-threonine kinase
that was originally recognized as a ki￾nase that phosphorylates glycogen syn￾thase. In contrast to most other kinases,
GSK-3β is active in a resting cell state;
however, it is inactivated by phosphory￾lation of Ser9
. GSK-3β is regulated by
multiple signaling pathways including
the Akt pathway, which inhibits this ki￾nase by causing Ser9 phosphorylation
(49,50). Consistent with the small decline
in the phosphorylation/activation of Akt
reported here (at 48 h of reperfusion), IRI
also caused a small decline in the phos￾phorylation of GSK-3β on Ser9
. This re￾sult may indicate an excessive activation
of GSK-3β, which in turn drives both in￾flammation (51) and tissue injury (52).
Most notably, pHBSP and EPO (when
given 6 h into reperfusion) significantly
enhanced Ser9 phosphorylation on
GSK-3β (at 48 h) to levels that were sig￾nificantly higher than those seen in
sham-operated rats. This enhanced phos￾phorylation of Ser9 will result in the inhi￾bition of the activity of GSK-3β, which
should make the tissues more resistant
against inflammation and injury. It
should be noted that other molecules that
increase in Ser9 phosphorylation resulting
in inhibition of GSK-3β exert potent anti￾inflammatory (51,53) and antiischemic ef￾fects in a number of organs including the
kidney (52,54,55). Interestingly, inhibition
of GSK-3β also mediates the cardiopro￾tective effects of EPO (52).
Downstream of GSK-3β, several stud￾ies have now reported an association be￾tween GSK-3β and NF-κB activity in
vitro (56,57) and in vivo (51,58). NF-κB is
a transcriptional factor that plays an im￾portant role in regulating the transcrip￾tion of a number of genes (for example,
iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2, IL-1, TNF and
IL-6), especially those involved in pro￾ducing mediators involved in local and
systemic inflammation, such as cyto -
kines, chemokines, cell adhesion mole￾cules, apoptotic factors and other media￾tors (59). Treatment of TNF-α–stimulated
hepatocytes with a specific GSK-3β in￾hibitor resulted in a decrease of the
NF-κB–dependent gene transcription
(60). This study also indicated four po￾tential phosphorylation sites for GSK-3β
on the NF-κB subunit p65. Most notably,
pretreatment with a number of chemi￾cally distinct inhibitors of GSK-3β atten￾uates organ injury and dysfunction in a
rodent model of polymicrobial septic
shock (51,53) and renal IRI (55). This
protective effect was associated with in￾hibition of the activation of NF-κB and
NF-κB–dependent proinflammatory
genes, along with a reduced phosphory￾lation of Ser536 on the NF-κB p65 sub￾unit. In addition, GSK-3β may also in￾hibit the activation of NF-κB by
phosphorylating and degrading IκBα,
which is required to prevent NF-κB
translocation (57). We report here that
IRI at 48 h of reperfusion results in a sig￾nificant increase in the activation of
NF-κB (measured here as nuclear
translocation of p65), which was attenu￾ated when pHBSP or EPO was given 6 h
into reperfusion. All of the above find￾ings support the view that pHBSP and
EPO restore the activation of Akt,
 resulting in inhibition of GSK-3β (after
phosphorylation on Ser9
) and inhibition
of the activation of NF-κB.
In addition to inhibiting the activation
of GSK-3β, activation of Akt results in
the phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser1177,
which in turn causes activation of eNOS
resulting in an enhanced formation of
NO in the microcirculation. In our study,
at 48 h of reperfusion, IRI did not affect
eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177 in the
kidney. Delayed administration of
pHBSP or EPO during reperfusion, how￾ever, caused an increase in eNOS phos￾phorylation and, hence, activity (to levels
that were significantly higher than levels

pHBSP ATTENUATES AKI

seen in sham-operated rats). The observed
increase in eNOS phosphorylation/activ￾ity was greatest after the administration of
EPO. In conditions associated with IRI, ac￾tivation of eNOS is beneficial, since the en￾hanced formation of NO causes local va￾sodilation, inhibits adhesion of platelets
and neutrophils and regulates angiogene￾sis (61). There is good evidence that agents
that release NO or enhance the formation
of endogenous NO attenuate organ in￾jury/dysfunction in AKI (62,63). Agents
that also inhibit the formation of NO from
inducible NOS (iNOS) also attenuate the
multiple organ failure associated with AKI
(64). Inhibition of eNOS activity also atten￾uates the cardioprotective effects of EPO,
suggesting that activation of eNOS impor￾tantly contributes to the protection of the
heart by EPO (65). Recently, Su et al. (16)
demonstrated that the βcR, when acti￾vated by EPO, causes phosphorylation of
Akt and in turn increases the interaction
between βcR and eNOS. This increase in
interaction results in the enhanced activa￾tion of eNOS and the production of NO.
Thus, activation of eNOS (possibly sec￾ondary to activation of Akt) may con￾tribute to the beneficial effects of EPO re￾ported here.
Activation of p38 MAPK occurs in re￾sponse to ischemia in many organs and
promotes cellular stress responses such
as proliferation, differentiation and pro￾duction of proinflammatory cytokines
(66,67). IRI of the kidney results in the
activation of p38 MAPK, whereas inhibi￾tion of the activity of this p38 MAPK in
renal IRI attenuates dysfunction and in￾jury (68). We report here that IRI results
in a significant activation of p38 MAPK
(when measured at 48 h after onset of
reperfusion) in the kidney, which was at￾tenuated by both pHBSP and EPO when
given 6 h into reperfusion. Our data are
consistent with the hypothesis that pre￾vention of the activation of p38 MAPK
contributes to the observed beneficial ef￾fects of pHBSP and EPO.
It should be duly noted that the kid￾ney is not the only organ to demonstrate
early recovery from injury. The brain has
also been shown to have a similar thera￾peutic temporal window of up to 6 h
after injury. It has been hypothesized
that the ability of EPO to induce late pro￾tection in the brain may be due to a
modulation of apoptosis, necrosis or im￾mune-mediated injury (69). A similar
scenario may also exist for both the kid￾ney and pHBSP, as demonstrated by the
data presented here.
CONCLUSION
This report states for the first time that
a delayed, single intraperitoneal admin￾istration of EPO and particularly the
nonhematopoietic EPO analog pHBSP
attenuates the renal dysfunction
(glomerular and tubular) and injury
(clusterin) caused by ischemia (30 min)
and reperfusion (48 h) in the rat. To gain
a better insight into the signaling path￾ways involved in the tissue-protective
and/or antiinflammatory effects of
pHBSP, we investigated the effects of
pHBSP on signaling pathways known to
play a role in tissue injury/survival
and/or inflammation. Because this pep￾tide is based on helix B of EPO, we car￾ried out these mechanistic studies in
kidney samples from animals also
treated with EPO, in the hope to find
common signaling events that contribute
to the observed beneficial effects of
pHBSP in vivo. In the kidney, ischemia￾reperfusion injury resulted in a small re￾duction in the activation of the survival
kinase Akt (measured as reduction in the
phosphorylation on Ser473). Treatment of
rats with pHBSP and EPO restored the
phosphorylation and, hence, activation
of Akt, which in turn resulted in inhibi￾tion of GSK-3β (secondary to phospho￾rylation on Ser9
) and inhibition of the ac￾tivation of NF-κB. There is now good
evidence that therapeutic strategies that
enhance the activation of Akt and reduce
the activation of GSK-3β enhance the re￾sistance of organs to noxious stimuli (in￾cluding ischemia) and reduce inflamma￾RESEARCH ARTICLE

Figure 5. Antiinflammatory mechanisms of
tissue-protective molecules. The antiinflam￾matory mechanism of EPOR-βcR activa￾tion is associated with (a) the activation of
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt
signaling pathway, which leads to the inhi￾bition of the activation of GSK-3β, which
subsequently suppresses NF-κB activity
leading to reduced expression of the
NF-κB–driven gene transcription of proin￾flammatory mediators; (b) in parallel inhi￾bition of the MAPK-p38 signaling pathway,
which subsequently suppresses the pro￾duction of proinflammatory mediators;
and (c) the activation of the PI3K-Akt sig￾naling pathway, which leads to increased
activation of eNOS, resulting in an en￾hanced formation of NO.

tion via inhibition of NF-κB (57). Activa￾tion of Akt by EPO (and to a lesser extent
pHBSP) also resulted in activation of
eNOS (measured as phosphorylation on
Ser1177), which in turn results in an in￾crease in eNOS activity and an enhanced
formation of NO in the microcirculation.
In addition, pHBSP attenuated the ische￾mia-reperfusion–induced activation of
p38 MAPK, which is known to con￾tribute to the development of organ
 injury/ inflammation in ischemia-
 reperfusion injury (70,71) (Figure 5). We
propose that all of the above signaling
events initiated by pHBSP and/or EPO
contribute to the beneficial effects of
these two molecules in AKI. Because the
beneficial effects of EPO in patients with
acute kidney injury, or even chronic kid￾ney disease, are limited by side effects
due to excessive erythropoiesis, we spec￾ulate that nonhematopoietic analogs of
EPO such as pHBSP may be useful to
mimic the tissue-protective effects of EPO
without causing the well-documented
side effects.
