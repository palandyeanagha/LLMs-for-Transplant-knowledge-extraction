ABSTRACT
Background Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
disease (CMCD) may result from various inborn errors of
interleukin (IL)-17-mediated immunity. Twelve of the 13
causal mutations described to date affect the coiled-coil
domain (CCD) of STAT1. Several mutations, including
R274W in particular, are recurrent, but the underlying
mechanism is unclear.
Objective To investigate and describe nine patients
with CMCD in Eastern and Central Europe, to assess the
biochemical impact of STAT1 mutations, to determine
cytokines in supernatants of Candida-exposed blood
cells, to determine IL-17-producing T cell subsets and to
determine STAT1 haplotypes in a family with the
c.820C>T (R274W) mutation.
Results The novel c.537C>A (N179K) STAT1 mutation
was gain-of-function (GOF) for γ-activated factor
(GAF)-dependent cellular responses. In a Russian patient,
the cause of CMCD was the newly identified c.854 A>G
(Q285R) STAT1 mutation, which was also GOF for
GAF-dependent responses. The c.1154C>T (T385M)
mutation affecting the DNA-binding domain (DBD)
resulted in a gain of STAT1 phosphorylation in a
Ukrainian patient. Impaired Candida-induced IL-17A and
IL-22 secretion by leucocytes and lower levels of
intracellular IL-17 and IL-22 production by T cells were
found in several patients. Haplotype studies indicated
that the c.820C>T (R274W) mutation was recurrent due
to a hotspot rather than a founder effect. Severe clinical
phenotypes, including intracranial aneurysm, are
presented.
Conclusions The c.537C>A and c.854A>G mutations
affecting the CCD and the c.1154C>T mutation affecting
the DBD of STAT1 are GOF. The c.820C>T mutation of
STAT1 in patients with CMCD is recurrent due to a
hotspot. Patients carrying GOF mutations of STAT1 may
develop multiple intracranial aneurysms by hitherto
unknown mechanisms.
INTRODUCTION
High susceptibility to mucosal and skin candidiasis is
a hallmark of several primary immunodeficiency dis￾orders (PIDs) associated with impaired interleukin
(IL)-17 T cell immunity.1–7 Isolated chronic mucocu￾taneous candidiasis (CMC) was first described in the
1960s, but its genetic causes remained unknown until
recently.4 6 CMC may occur in patients with PIDs
and various other pathological conditions, such as
severe combined immunodeficiency, combined
immunodeficiency-like dedicator of cytokinesis 8 defi￾ciency, signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT) 3 deficiency causing autosomal-dominant
hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), autosomal recessive
(AR), autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1,
AR IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12p40 deficiencies, AR tyrosine
kinase (TYK) 2 deficiency and AR caspase recruitment
domain nine deficiency.1 6 However, CMC may be
the only or the principal disease phenotype in patients
with PIDs, such as AD IL-17F and AR IL-17RA defi￾ciencies,8 and gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of
STAT1.
9 In such cases of essentially isolated CMC, the
patients are described as suffering from CMC disease
(CMCD).8–13
Mutations affecting the STAT1 coiled-coil
domain (CCD) were the first to be implicated in
CMCD, initially in a patient with sporadic CMCD
from Ukraine and then in various kindreds of dif￾ferent ethnic origins.9–13 This was somewhat sur￾prising, because previously reported STAT1
mutations affecting the DNA-binding domain
(DBD), the SH2 domain, the tail segment and even
some other mutations affecting the CCD (K201N
and K211R) had been linked to Mendelian suscep￾tibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD), with or
without predisposition to viral, but not candidal
diseases.7 It was suggested that various CCD muta￾tions, including the D165G mutation found in the
index patient from the Ukraine and the 11 add￾itional sequence variants found in CMCD patients,
actually resulted in a gain of phosphorylation and
GOF due to a loss of dephosphorylation of STAT1
homodimers after translocation to the nucleus.9
The picture has been complicated even further by
recent reports of two patients with sporadic
CMCD and the T385M DBD mutation associated
with a GOF due to hyperphosphorylation and
impaired dephosphorylation after nuclear trans￾location.13 Indeed, previously reported mutations
affecting the DBD were loss-of-function (LOF) and
were found in patients with mycobacterial disease.7
Various STAT1 GOF mutations (affecting the
CCD or the DBD) have been systematically asso￾ciated with susceptibility to CMCD. Primary

STAT1 defects have been described over the last 10 years, and
the susceptibility of affected patients to infections with viruses,
mycobacteria, staphylococci and fungi has been shown to depend
on the monoallelic or biallelic and GOF or LOF nature of the
mutations they carry.7 Several patients with GOF STAT1 muta￾tions presenting not only CMCD, but also severe viral infections
and/or autoimmune signs have recently been described.9–13
Clearly, more clinical data and phenotype–genotype studies are
required to define the CMCD caused by STAT1 sequence var￾iants. We describe here the genetic, immunological and clinical
findings for nine patients with STAT1 mutations and CMCD
diagnosed in four Eastern and Central European (ECE) countries
by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
The patients and their families are described in the online sup￾plementary case reports. All the patients are Caucasian. Genetic
data, infectious signs and immunological findings are sum￾marised in tables 1–3. All the studies described here were
approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of the University of
Debrecen Medical and Health Science Center and by the institu￾tional review boards of the centres at which the patients were
managed. Informed consent was obtained from the patients or
their parents (for minors).
Detection of mutations
Exome sequencing. DNA (3 μg) was extracted from Epstein–
Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells (EBV-B cells; see below)
and sheared with a Covaris S2 Ultrasonicator. An adaptor￾ligated library was prepared with the TruSeq DNA Sample
Preparation Kit (Illumina). Exome capture was performed with
the SureSelect Human All Exon kit (Agilent).9 14–17 Paired-end
sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 generat￾ing 100 bp reads. For sequence alignment, variant calling and
annotation, the sequences were aligned with the human genome
reference sequence (GRCh37 build), with the Burrows–Wheeler
Aligner.17 18 Downstream processing was carried out with the
Genome analysis toolkit (GATK) and SAMtools.18 19 Variant
calls were made with a GATK Unified Genotyper. All calls with

a read coverage two times or less and a Phred-scaled quality of
20 or less were excluded. All variants were annotated with an
in-house annotation software system.
Sanger sequencing. Genomic DNA from the patients was pre￾pared with the Gen Elute Blood Genomic DNA kit
(Sigma-Aldrich). Targeted sequencing was performed by ampli￾fying the exons and flanking intron regions of STAT1 by PCR.
The PCR primers and sequencing primers used are available on
request. Amplicons were sequenced with the Big Dye
Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, California, USA) and were analysed with an ABI 3130
capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California,
USA). Sequence variants were identified relative to a reference
sequence, GenBank accession no. ENST00000361099 for the
STAT1 cDNA, in which the c.1 position corresponds to the A of
the ATG translation initiation codon. Mutations are designated
as recommended by den Dunnen and Antonarakis.20
Luciferase reporter assay
U3C cells, a STAT1-deficient fibrosarcoma cell line,9 were dis￾pensed into 96-well plates (1×104 cells/well) and transfected
with 100 ng/well reporter plasmids (Cignal GAS Reporter Assay
kit, SA Biosciences) and plasmids carrying the c.537C>A or
c.854A>G alleles of STAT1 or a mock vector, in the presence of
Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen).9 Six hours after transfection,
the cells were transferred back to medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and cultured for 18 h. The transfectants
were then stimulated by incubation with interferon (IFN)-γ
(10 or 1000 U/ml) for 16 h and subjected to luciferase assays
with the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega).
Experiments were performed in triplicate. The data are
expressed as fold induction with respect to unstimulated cells.
Generation of EBV-transformed lymphoblasts
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by
centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare
Bio-Science AB, Uppsala, Sweden). They were then washed
twice with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and twice with
Hanks balanced salt solution (Sigma). Cells (107
/ml) were resus￾pended in 2.5 ml RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glu￾tamine and 1 mg/ml cyclosporin A (CyA). They were then
infected with 2.5 ml of the supernatant of B95–8 cells infected
with EBV and incubated for 2 h in a water bath at 37°C. We
added 5 ml RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glu￾tamine and 1 mg/ml CyA, transferred the cells to T25 flasks
(TPP, Switzerland) and incubated them at 37°C under an atmos￾phere containing 5% CO2 for 3 weeks.
Extraction of nuclear proteins and western blotting
EBV-B cells were stimulated with IFN-γ, IFN-α or IL-27 for
30 min and subjected to nuclear extraction with the Subcellular
Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We assessed phos￾phorylation by stimulating EBV-B cells with 2000 U/ml IFN-γ.
9
In selected experiments, cells were stimulated with IFN-α
(2000 U/ml) or IL-27 (2000 U/ml). The cells were then washed
and incubated with 1 μM staurosporine in RPMI for 15 and
30 min, and nuclear proteins were extracted with the Protein
Fractionation Kit (Thermo Scientific). The proteins were sub￾jected to immunoblot analysis. The effect of the phosphatase
inhibitor pervanadate on IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation
was assessed by incubating the transformed B cells with
this compound for 5 min before stimulation as previously
described.9
Candida
Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) was maintained on Sabouraud
dextrose agar at 4°C, with subculture once monthly, by transfer
onto fresh medium and overnight culture at 37°C.21
Stationary-phase cultures were prepared by inoculating 2 ml of
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 100 U/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin with
Candida. The density of Candida was adjusted to 1×104 cells/ml
with a McFarland densitometer. Heat-inactivated yeast was

prepared by inoculating 5 ml SalSol (TEVA, Debrecen, Hungary)
with Candida and incubating the culture at 56°C for 1 h. We
checked that the heat inactivation was effective by transferring
various dilutions of Candida suspension onto Sabouraud dex￾trose agar and incubating for 48 h.22 The heat-killed Candida
suspension was then centrifuged at 4000×g for 10 min, and the
cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM. The density of
heat-inactivated Candida was adjusted to 1×106
/ml with a
McFarland densitometer.
Cell isolation and stimulation
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from the patients and
controls. PBMCs were incubated as described above. After
centrifugation and several washes in Krebs-Ringer phosphate
buffer, the cells were resuspended in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, Missouri, USA). PBMCs were incubated (5×105 cells/
well) for 48 h at 37°C in 96-well round-bottomed culture plates
that had been sterilised by gamma irradiation and were free of
pyrogens, RNA, RNases, DNA and DNases (TPP, Trasadingen,
Switzerland), either alone or in the presence of heat-killed
C albicans. Once the blood cells had been exposed to Candida
for 2 days, the plates were centrifuged and the supernatants
were removed and stored at −20°C for the determination of
cytokine concentrations.
ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAYS
The concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-22 in
the supernatants of Candida-exposed PBMCs and IL-17F in the
supernatants of cultured lymphocytes were determined by sand￾wich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Quantikine, R&D
Systems, Minnesota, USA). All experiments were performed in
duplicate or triplicate.
Induction and differentiation of IL-17-producing T cells
PBMCs were washed with SalSol (TEVA) and suspended in
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% glutamine.
Adherent cells were removed by incubation for 4 h in RPMI, in
T25 flasks (TPP), at 37°C, under an atmosphere containing 5%
CO2. The non-adherent cells were activated with anti-CD3 anti￾bodies in a 12-well plates and were treated with a cocktail
of human transforming growth factor-β1 (5 ng/ml), IL-1β
(10 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml) and recombinant human (rh)IL-23
(20 ng/ml), all from PeproTech (London, UK). Two days later,
an additional 2 ml of RPMI containing the cytokines listed
above, plus IL-2 (22 ng/ml; PeproTech), was added to each well.
Four days later, another 2 ml of RPMI without cytokines
was added to the wells. The following day, the cells were
treated with brefeldin A isolated from Penicillium brefeldianum
(1 μg/ml; Sigma) and were left unstimulated or were stimulated
with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 50 ng/ml) and
ionomycin (IMC; 10−5 M) for 6 h at 37°C under an atmosphere
containing 5% CO2, centrifuged at 150 ×g for 6 min,
suspended and washed in 2% FBS–bovine serum albumin
(BSA)–PBS buffer.
Flow cytometry
We detected intracellular IL-17 and IL-22 in CD3 and CD4 T
cells with an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
CD3 cells were identified with an fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-hCD3 IgG1 mAb (Beckman
Coulter), and CD4 cells were labelled by incubation with
allophycocyanin-conjugated mouse anti-hCD4 IgG1 mAb (BD)
for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were then incubated with 50 μl
Fix&Perm Fixation Medium A (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 4°C.
They were then washed with 2% FBS–BSA–PBS buffer and
resuspended in 50 μl Fix&Perm Permeabilization Medium B
(Invitrogen). Intracellular IL-17 was detected with
phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-hIL-17 IgG1 mAb, and
intracellular IL-22 was labelled with FITC-conjugated mouse
anti-hIL-22 IgG1 mAb, both from R&D Systems. Cells were
incubated for 30 min at 4°C, washed with 2% FBS–BSA–PBS
and suspended in 500 μl 0.1% paraformaldehyde.
Haplotype analysis
Familial haplotyping was performed by Sanger sequencing as
described above. The following previously reported intronic
polymorphisms were genotyped: rs7597768, rs2280234,
rs2280233, rs2066804, rs41507345 and rs11693463. The
primers used for PCR and sequencing are available upon
request.
RESULTS
Genetic findings
We carried out WES, to identify sequence variation, in patients
P8 and P9 (table 1). The mutations detected were confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. In patients P1–P7, Sanger sequencing was
used to analyse STAT1. Two familial and five sporadic STAT1
mutations were found; all but three of these mutations were
located in exon 10 of STAT1 and all were heterozygous, mis￾sense mutations (table 1). Some of the data for patients P4, P5
and P9 have been reported before,9 11 whereas the data for
patients P1–P3 and P6–P8 are reported for the first time here.
Two new STAT1 mutations affecting the CCD of STAT1
(patients P1 and P7) and one mutation affecting the DBD
(patient P8) were detected. We isolated genomic DNA from the
EBV-transformed lymphoblasts of patients P4, P5 and P8 and
used it for Sanger sequencing. The mutations found in freshly
isolated blood cells were also present in EBV-transformed cells
(see online supplementary figure S1).
The two new c.537C>A (N179K) and c.854A>G (Q285R)
mutations of STAT1 result in a GOF for GAF-dependent
cellular responses
The two new mutations affecting the STAT1 CCD, N179K and
Q285R, were found in a Czech patient (patient P1) and a
Russian patient, respectively (P7). These patients were not avail￾able for biochemical studies. We therefore analysed the possible
pathological consequences of these mutations by site-directed
mutagenesis and studies of γ-activated factor (GAF)-dependent
cellular responses to IFN-γ. We transfected STAT1-deficient
U3C cells with wild-type (WT) STAT1 and c.537C>A (N179K)
and c.854A>G (Q285R) STAT1 mutant constructs, and with
the previously characterised CMCD-causing c. 821G>A
(R274Q)9 and autosomal-dominant MSMD-causing Y701C
STAT1 alleles Hirato O et al (manuscript submitted). Responses
to cytokine stimulation were investigated by measuring the luci￾ferase activity of the reporter gene under the control of the
γ-activated sequence (GAS) promoter. Stimulation with various
concentrations (10 and 1000 U/ml) of IFN-γ resulted in
responses that were two to three times stronger in cells trans￾fected with the two new mutant alleles or with the
CMCD-causing R274Q allele than in those transfected with
WT or MSMD-causing Y701C alleles (figure 1). These data
suggest that the new heterozygous alleles reported in this study
are GOF for GAF-dependent cellular responses to IFN-γ, one of
the key STAT1-activating cytokines.

The T385M and R274W STAT1 mutations result in a gain of
phosphorylation of STAT1
It was initially suggested that the STAT1 mutations in CMCD
patients affected the STAT1 CCD only, resulting in a GOF
because of a gain of phosphorylation.9 We detected a recently
reported mutation, c.1154C>T (T385M), affecting the STAT1
DBD, in one of the Ukrainian CMCD patients (table 1; patient
P8).13 EBV-B cells from P4 and P8, heterozygous for the
R274W and T385M mutations, respectively, were treated with
IFN-γ, IFN-α and IL-27, all of which predominantly activate
STAT1.9 Western blotting showed that treatment with these
cytokines resulted in stronger STAT1 phosphorylation in the
nuclear extracts of cells from both patients than in those from
controls (figure 2A), demonstrating that the heterozygous alleles
were associated with a dominant phenotype of gain of STAT1
phosphorylation. Incubation with the TYK inhibitor staurospor￾ine and comparison with the control lymphoblasts showed that
the dephosphorylation of IFN-γ-treated EBV-B cells heterozy￾gous for the STAT1 T385M or R274W alleles was impaired
(figure 2B). By contrast, after pervanadate treatment, the phos￾phorylation of T385M STAT1 and R274W STAT1 was similar
to that of WT STAT1 (see online supplementary figure S2).
These data confirm that the T385M and R274W amino acid
substitutions in STAT1 result in a gain of STAT1 phosphoryl￾ation due to a loss of dephosphorylation.9 13
Figure 2 STAT1 dephosphorylation in nuclear extracts. Western blotting was performed on nuclear extracts of EBV-transformed lymphocytes from
P8 and P4, carrying the c.1154C>T (T385) and c.820C>T (R274W) heterozygous missense mutations of STAT1, respectively (table 1). (A) Before

Release of cytokines by Candida-exposed white blood cells
from CMCD patients
We measured the release of various inflammatory cytokines by
freshly isolated PBMCs after 48 h of stimulation with heat-killed
Candida. Similar amounts of IFN-γ, IL-1β and IL-6 were
released by the cells of P8 (T385M) and control cells
(figure 3A). By contrast, PBMCs from P8 released negligible
amounts of IL-17A and IL-22, much smaller than those released
by Candida-exposed cells from healthy controls (figure 3B).
Similar data were obtained with cells from P4 and P5 carrying
the R274W allele (figure 3C,D). These data suggest a normal
‘Th1-type’ reaction, and normal IL-1β and IL-6 release in
response to stimulation with C albicans, but an impaired
‘Th-17-type’ response to this fungus in patients with
CMCD-associated mutations.
Ex vivo differentiation of IL-17-producing and
IL-22-producing T cells
PBMCs were isolated and treated with IL-17-inducing cytokines
as described above. Flow cytometry was used to determine the
percentages of CD3 T cells and CD4 T cells-producing cytoplas￾mic IL-17 or IL-22 (figure 4). Before marker analysis, the cells
were treated with PMA and IMC for 6 h. Consistent with the
cytokine-release data, the patient with the T385M STAT1 allele
displayed impaired development of IL-17-producing and
IL-22-producing T cells (figure 4A–C). Similar results were
obtained for the cells of one of the patients (P4) with the het￾erozygous R274W allele (figure 4A–C).
In another study, we evaluated the in vitro differentiation
of IL-17-producing T cells from naïve CD45RA CD4 T cells
under various conditions of stimulation (plates coated with
anti-CD3 antibody, soluble anti-CD28 antibody alone or
together with various combinations of IL-1β, IL-23 and IL-6)
(Okada S. et al, manuscript submitted). We found that the
best conditions were as follows: plates coated with anti-CD3
antibody, soluble anti-CD28 antibody plus IL-1β and IL-23.
Under these conditions, we observed strong impairment of
the development of IL-17-producing T cells in CMCD patients
bearing STAT1 GOF mutations, as assessed by comparison
with controls.
We also measured the release of IL-17F by PBMCs from P4
and P5 after the cytokine-induced in vitro differentiation of
T cells into IL-17-producing lymphocytes. After 5 days of cyto￾kine treatment, the cells were stimulated with PMA and IMC
for 6 h and IL-17F concentrations were determined by enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) on the supernatants.
Control experiments were performed with cells isolated from
healthy individuals and with cells obtained from a patient with
AD-HIES caused by a dominant negative mutation of STAT3
(figure 5). An impairment of IL-17F release by the cells of both
CMCD patients bearing the R274W allele and by the cells of
the patients with AD-HIES was observed.

Hotspot mutation affecting the STAT1 CCD
The sequencing of STAT1 in two related patients revealed the
presence of a c.820C>T heterozygous mutation affecting the
CCD and leading to a predicted R274W substitution in
the STAT1 protein (table 1). About 30% of the CMCD patients
with STAT1 mutations have mutations affecting R2749–11 13
(Okada S et al, manuscript submitted). It was not clear whether
the mutations at this position had arisen de novo in all families,

or whether the large number of families carrying this mutation
resulted from a founder effect. We therefore investigated
whether the two mutations affecting position 274 (c.820C>T,
leading to the R274W substitution, and c.821G>A, leading to
the R274Q substitution) were due to a founder effect or a
hotspot, by genotyping six polymorphisms surrounding the
mutation in healthy and affected members of seven families
(table 4). We obtained evidence of a hotspot effect for both
mutations in families in which the mutation was absent from
both healthy parents and occurred de novo in the patient. The
affected individuals from different families had different haplo￾types, ruling out the founder effect proposed by another group.10
Complications of CMCD
Autoimmune thyroiditis appears to be the most common auto￾immune complication in CMCD patients9 12 13 (supplementary
case reports). No signs of systemic autoimmune disease were
observed. Five patients reported here developed oesophageal
candidiasis, and P2, P4 and P8 also had oesophageal stricture,
necessitating balloon dilatation (P4) or Nissen fundoplication
(P8). Recurrent pneumonia developed in six patients and was
complicated with pulmonary abscess (P4), bronchiectasis and
even clubbing (P9).1 Four patients had recurrent mucocutaneous
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and two patients with the
R274W allele (P4 and P5) also had recurrent shingles.11 These
findings suggest that Candida oesophagitis, damage to the
respiratory tissues and recurrent herpes virus disease may be
common complications of CMCD and that early antifungal
prophylaxis might help to prevent these complications. P1 suf￾fered a fatal complication in the form of mycotic cerebral aneur￾ysm leading to intracranial bleeding.
DISCUSSION
The pathogenesis of CMC in several complex PIDs, such as
AD-HIES with LOF STAT3 mutations,23 24 and that of
AD-CMCD with STAT1 GOF mutations, has only recently been
determined.9–13 25 This report provides the first comprehensive
overview of the molecular genetics, immunological and clinical
features of patients diagnosed with sporadic and familial
CMCD in ECE. We describe here several new STAT1 alleles
with mutations affecting the CCD, and new phenotypic mani￾festations of the T385M mutation affecting the DBD. The two
new mutations reported here (N179K and Q285R) increase the
number of known CMCD-causing STAT1 mutations to 15. All
but one of the heterozygous CMCD-causing mutations, includ￾ing the two new sequence variants described in this cohort,
affected the CCD of STAT1, consistent with previous sugges￾tions that this is the most frequently affected domain of the
protein in patients with CMCD (table 1).9 10 The two patients
with previously unknown CCD mutations were not available for
biochemical testing. However, site-directed mutagenesis and
GAS-dependent reporter gene expression assays clearly sug￾gested that the underlying mechanism involved a GOF for GAF
responses to IFN-γ. The higher level of reporter gene induction
presented here indicates that these new mutations may be
responsible for the CMCD phenotype, consistent with previ￾ously published data showing CMCD-causing GOF mutant
STAT1 alleles to be dominant for GAF activation.9 P8, like two
recently described Japanese patients,13 had mutations affecting
the DBD of STAT1. We found that the mutation in P8, like the
new CCD mutations, resulted in the impaired dephosphorylation
of STAT1. The artificial F172W mutation, positioned next to the
N179K mutation found in patient P1, and the artificial G384A
or G384W mutations next to the T385M mutation, described
elsewhere13 and found in patient P8 have been reported to
impair the dephosphorylation of STAT1.26 27 However, loss of
dephosphorylation may not be the only mechanism responsible
for the GOF, and other mechanisms, such as stronger binding of
the mutant DBD STAT1 to GAS, may also play a role.
We suggest that determinations of the Candida-stimulated
release of IL-17A and IL-22 cytokines by PBMCs is a reliable
and reproducible method for assessing the impairment of IL-17
T cell-mediated immunity in CMCD patients (11 and this
report). In our hands, live and heat-killed C albicans were
equally effective for inducing cytokine release by control blood
mononuclear cells (only the data for heat-killed Candida are
shown). The data presented here suggest that the IL-17 T cell
deficiency responsible for the greater susceptibility to mucosal
Candida infection in CMCD patients is not limited to the cells
beneath body surfaces, instead extending to circulating blood
cells. In contrast to the impaired release of IL-17A and IL-22 by
PBMCs from patients with STAT1 GOF mutations affecting the
CCD or DBD, the Candida-induced release of IFN-γ, IL-1β and
IL-6 was similar in the blood cells of patients and controls, sug￾gesting that the activation of alternative cytokine pathways was
intact. Intriguingly, it has been reported that PBMCs exposed to
Candida-derived mitogens produce smaller amounts of IFN-γ in
patients with STAT1 GOF alleles10 12 By contrast, we showed
that the production of IFN-γ by patients’ PBMCs stimulated
with heat-killed Candida blastoconidia was similar to that of
control subjects. These discrepancies may reflect differences in
the assay systems used. We believe that our data are more con￾sistent with clinical observations, as IFN-γ does not play a non￾redundant role in immunity to C albicans, whether systemic or
peripheral. Indeed, patients with inborn errors of IFN-γ do not
present candidiasis of any form.28 Consistent with the impaired
release of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22, ex vivo analysis by using
flow cytometry showed IL-17 T cell levels to be lower in CMCD
patients with mutations affecting the CCD or the DBD than in
controls. Thus, mutations affecting either the CCD (patient P4)
or the DBD (patient P8) of STAT1 result in similar immuno￾logical phenotypes and cytokine release profiles in terms of
IL-17 T cell immunity.

The phenotypic manifestations of the various STAT1 muta￾tions affecting the CCD may differ, despite the similar molecu￾lar and cellular/immunological features. P1 developed multiple
intracranial aneurysms and intracranial bleeding. Two of the 47
patients described in the first report on CMCD and STAT1 GOF
mutation also developed cerebral aneurysms at the ages of 8 and
38 years.9 One of the four patients described in a subsequent
report died from cerebral vasculitis.13 However, no cerebral vas￾cular complications were reported in subsequently described
patients,10–12 25 suggesting that CMCD patients may develop
this complication only rarely. It has been suggested that intracra￾nial aneurysms due to the damage caused by Candida result
directly from candidal invasion of the arterial wall, usually in
major intracranial vessels.29–31 Recent findings suggest that
STAT1 production and function may be enhanced in the tissues
of abdominal aortic aneurysms, and that tyrosine￾phosphorylated STAT1 levels may be higher in these tissues,
resulting in higher levels of total STAT1 protein activity.32 It
remains unclear whether GOF STAT1 mutations play a direct
role in aneurysm formation in CMCD patients or whether
aneurysm formation is a direct consequence of the damage
caused by Candida.
33 34 P1 had not only multiple intracerebral
aneurysms, but also renal abscesses caused by C albicans, sug￾gesting that patients with STAT1 mutations affecting the CCD

may develop deep-seated candidal disease. This is the first such
observation to be reported for patients with CMCD. The clin￾ical phenotype of P8 was somewhat different from that previ￾ously described for two Japanese patients carrying the same
mutation (T385M).13 P8 had early oesophageal involvement
and developed oesophageal stricture necessitating Nissen fundo￾plication. He also presented recurrent severe HSV infections.
None of these clinical features were observed in the Japanese
patients, who were otherwise of similar age and genotype. By
contrast, both Japanese patients had recurrent lower respiratory
tract infections, bronchiectasis and autoimmune thyroiditis. One
of these patients died from disseminated intravascular coagula￾tion and pulmonary insufficiency of unknown origin. These
data suggest that the phenotypic expression of the T385M allele
may differ significantly between affected patients.
The enhanced response to type I IFNs in the STAT1 GOF
patients is reminiscent of the type I signature observed in patients
with autoimmune diseases, such as Aicardi–Goutières syndrome
patients or patients with immuno-osseous dysplasia spondy￾loenchondrodysplasia.35 36 These patients also present auto￾immune thyroiditis. It is therefore possible that the enhanced
response to type I IFNs is responsible for the autoimmune thyroi￾ditis observed in the patients with STAT1 GOF mutations. In add￾ition, patients treated with recombinant type I IFNs often present
such autoimmune manifestations as secondary effects.37 38
Furthermore, higher levels of intracellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1) expression have been implicated in the pathogenic
mechanism of autoimmune thyroiditis.39 ICAM-1 levels have
never been assessed in patients with STAT1 GOF, but in vitro
studies of FRTL-5 thyroid cells exposed to IFN-γ showed an
induction of ICAM1 gene transcription via GAS binding to the
ICAM1 promoter.40 41 It is therefore possible that STAT1 GOF
mutations predispose patients to autoimmune thyroid disease by
enhancing the responses of thyroid cells to type I IFNs.
Autoimmune hepatitis, which may also occur in patients with
STAT1 GOF mutation, is known to be mediated by T cells, and
CD4 T cells are the predominant population of lymphocytes
infiltrating the liver.42 It has been shown that, in a mouse
model, IFN-γ activation of STAT1 contributes to
Con-A-induced liver damage by activating CD4 cells and indu￾cing hepatocyte death.43 Based on these observations, we
suggest that STAT1 GOF mutation may cause autoimmune hepa￾titis by inducing a strong IL-12β-IFN-γ- Janus kinase–STAT1
circuit in affected patients.
The R274W substitution found in two members of the
Hungarian family resulted from one of the most frequent STAT1
mutations, suggesting that R274 may be a hotspot for mutation
in patients with CMC.9 11 However, a previous report on
STAT1 sequence variants suggested that affected patients may
have a founder mutation.10 We therefore tested the hypothesis
of a founder effect by carrying out haplotype analyses on the
two patients described here and six previously described fam￾ilies.9 Haplotype analyses of two families carrying the R274W
mutation suggested that this mutation was associated with a
common disease-causing allele, but we demonstrated that R274
was a hotspot for mutation in patients with CMCD (table 4).
Not only did we observe the de novo occurrence of the muta￾tion in two families, but we also provide genetic evidence that
the mutation is carried by different alleles in patients from dif￾ferent families. The de novo occurrence of mutations affecting
other positions in the CCD of STAT1 (Y170N and D165H) has
already been described.9 Overall, these data, together with the
high incidence of mutations affecting this domain of STAT1,
provide strong evidence that this DNA region is prone to errors.
The increasing number of CMCD cases reported in publications
over the last year might be considered suggestive of a founder
effect, but we demonstrate here that this DNA sequence may be
prone to germline replication errors. However, the reasons for this
DNA sequence being a ‘super’ hotspot for mutation despite its lack
of enrichment in trinucleotide repeats remain to be elucidated.
In summary, we report here molecular and clinical data for the
nine patients with CMCD diagnosed to date in ECE countries.
WES and Sanger sequencing revealed two previously unknown
alleles of STAT1 with mutations affecting the CCD domain.
Immunological and biochemical studies have shown that both
CCD and DBD mutations may result in impairment of the
Candida-stimulated release of IL-17A/F and IL-22 by lymphocytes,
and that CMCD patients have impaired IL-17 T cell differentiation
ex vivo. We also report a young patient with a previously unknown
STAT1 mutation and multiple intracranial aneurysms and intracra￾nial bleeding, suggesting that inflammatory vascular disease may be
a phenotypic consequence of STAT1 GOF alleles affecting the
CCD. Our data suggest that the R274W substitution is due to a
mutation hotspot rather than a founder mutation. Further studies
are required to define the precise molecular mechanisms of the
complications observed in CMCD, including, in particular, the role
of Candida and Candida-derived molecules in the development of
aneurysms. Furthermore, the contribution of memory T cell defects
to the recurrent HSV disease found in four patients in this cohort
remains unclear, and the possible relationship between auto￾immune thyroiditis and central or peripheral defects of controlling
autoimmunity remains to be defined. Specific approaches, such as
the J Project, are required to investigate PID gene mutations and
genotype–phenotype relationships in various populations.44–47
