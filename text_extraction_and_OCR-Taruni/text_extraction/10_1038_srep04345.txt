Human-associated microbial communities play important roles in health and disease. Antibiotic
administration is arguably one of the most important modifiable determinants of the composition of the
human microbiota. However, quantitatively modeling antibiotic use to account for its impact on microbial
community dynamics presents a challenge. We used antibiotic therapy of chronic lung infection in persons
with cystic fibrosis as a model system to assess the influence of key variables of therapy on measures of
microbial community perturbation. We constructed multivariate linear mixed models with bacterial
community diversity as the outcome measure and various scales of antibiotic weighting as predictors, while
controlling for other variables. Antibiotic weighting consisted of three components: (i) dosing duration; (ii)
timing of administration relative to sample collection; and (iii) antibiotic type and route of administration.
Antibiotic weighting based on total dose and proximity to the time of sampling was most predictive of
bacterial community change. Using this model to control for antibiotic use enabled the identification of
other significant independent predictors of microbial community diversity such as dominant taxon, disease
stage, and gender. Quantitative modeling of antibiotic use is critical in understanding the relationships
between human microbiota and disease treatment and progression.
T
he advent of next generation sequencing has enabled culture-independent profiling of complex human￾associated bacterial communities (microbiota) in unprecedented detail. Application of this approach has
dramatically expanded our understanding of the diversity of microbiota associated with various human
body habitats1
, different human populations2
, and periods of health and illness3–7. Metagenomic, metabolomic,
and metatranscriptomic analyses have now begun to investigate the functional attributes of these microbial
communities to better understand the role human microbiota play in health maintenance, predisposition to
and pathogenesis of disease, and the response to therapy8–13. Such studies view the human body as an ecosystem,
with human health being dependent in part upon the services provided by the host-associated microbiota. In this
regard, the application of ecological theory to study human microbiota is gaining increasing attention14. Microbial
community assembly theory, in particular, is finding application in efforts to understand the processes that shape
diversity in local assemblages during periods of ill health, treatment and recovery.
A key element of community assembly theory is an appreciation of the effects of community disturbance on
diversity and the recovery of communities after perturbation. With respect to the human ecosystem, antibiotic
therapy serves as a paradigm for disturbance of host-associated communities; in fact, antibiotic administration
may be considered the most important and common form of disturbance of the human microbiota14–19. In studies
of human gut microbiota, for example, the effect of antibiotic administration on diversity is far greater than the
routine temporal variability in community composition16,19,20.
Despite the prominent role that antibiotic therapy plays in effecting changes in microbial community com￾position and reassembly of local communities, robust quantitative models of antibiotic use are lacking. This limits
incorporating measures of antibiotic use in studies to assess the relationships between antibiotic-driven com￾munity perturbation, movement, and reassembly. As important, this presents a challenge to studies wherein
antibiotic use must be controlled as one of a number of variables that impact community diversity and disease
progression. This is especially relevant in studies of chronic infectious diseases characterized by recurrent,
intensive antibiotic administration.
We used treatment of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF), a condition characterized by persistent bacterial
infection of the airways managed with chronic maintenance antibiotic therapy as well as intensive episodic
antibiotic treatment, to develop a quantitative model of antibiotic use. We tested the effect of antibiotic admin￾istration on airway bacterial community diversity (our outcome measure of interest) by considering the duration

and timing of administration relative to the day of sampling, as well
as antibiotic class and route of administration. A training data set,
composed of 116 sputum samples that had been extensively charac￾terized with respect to microbial community profiles, antibiotic
exposure, and metrics of patient health, was used to develop a test
model21. This model was then validated with a larger data set con￾sisting of 362 similarly characterized respiratory samples. We show
how this model may be adapted to other studies of the relationship
between microbial community dynamics, antibiotic use and disease
progression.
Results
Characterization of patients and sputum samples. The patients
and sputum samples included in the training and validation data
sets were characterized with respect to two types of variables
(Table 1 and 2). Fixed, patient-specific variables included gender,
CFTR genotype, and disease severity (or aggressiveness) pheno￾type21,22. Time-dependent, sample-specific variables included
patient age, lung function, and disease stage21 at the time of sample
collection. Lung function was measured as percent predicted forced
expiratory volume in one sec (%FEV1). Disease stage was defined as
early when serial %FEV1 measures were .70; intermediate when
%FEV1 measures were between 70 and 40; and advanced when
%FEV1 measures were ,40. The dominant operational taxonomic
unit (OTU) detected in each sample by deep-sequencing was also
included as a sample-specific variable. This was defined as the most
abundant OTU detected in the sample. Bacterial community
diversity of each sputum sample was measured by calculating the
inverse Simpson index, which takes into account both the number of
OTUs (richness) present in the sample and their relative abundance
(evenness).
The training set samples (n 5 116) were from six men previously
described by us in detail21. All six patients had a mild or moderate
disease severity phenotype. Samples were collected when these
patients were between 18 and 30 years of age. The samples were
roughly evenly distributed among periods when these patients were
in early, intermediate, or late stages of lung disease. The dominant
OTU in most (82%) samples represented the genus Pseudomonas.
The patients (n 5 60) and sputum samples (n 5 362) in the valid￾ation set were more heterogeneous. Men represented 53% of patients
and there was a greater distribution of patients with mild, moderate
and severe disease severity phenotypes. The validation set samples
were also more diverse with respect to the dominant OTU detected.
Of note, none of the patients in either the training set or the valid￾ation set were smokers.
Antibiotic weighting score development. The antibiotic exposure
associated with each sample was measured by assessing the antibiotic
administration to the source patient during a 30-day window prior to
sample collection. The duration of exposure (no. of days receiving the
antibiotic), the timing of administration relative to the day of
sampling (e.g., 20 days vs 2 days prior to sampling), and the
antibiotic class and route of administration were determined for
each sample.
These variables were used to develop antibiotic weighting compo￾nents that yielded scores used as covariates in models predicting
bacterial community diversity.
Weight component A. (wcA; Equation 1 in Materials and Methods,
and Fig. S1) accounts for the duration of antibiotic use during this 30
day window by assessing the number of days an antibiotic was (wcA
5 1) or was not (wcA 5 0) administered (Fig. 1A). wcA for each
antibiotic was determined from observed sample level data without
subjective assessment and was constructed similarly for all samples
in both the training and validation data sets.
Weight component B. (wcB; Equation 2 in Materials and Methods)
accounts for the proximity of antibiotic use relative to the sampling
day. Four weighting schemes, described by the formulas in Equation
2, were assessed, including (i) an equal weight for each day irrespect￾ive of proximity to the sampling date, (ii) a linear increase in weights
with increasing proximity to the sampling date, and either (iii) a
concave or (iv) a convex increase in weights with increasing prox￾imity to the sampling date (Fig. 1B and Table S1). A score for each
antibiotic administered during the 30 days prior to the date of each
sputum sample was calculated as a product of wcA and wcB
(Equation 3 in Materials and Methods). The sum of the scores for
all antibiotics administered in association with a sputum sample was
calculated to provide the total antibiotic exposure for each sample
(Equation 4 in Materials and Methods).
Using the total antibiotic exposure for each sputum sample, the
training dataset was analyzed to determine which of the four wcB
weighting schemes best predicted the inverse Simpson index, which
had been previously calculated for each sample, based on the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC), after adjusting for age and %FEV1 at
the sampling time. A comparison of AICs indicated that the convex
increasing weighting scheme provided the best prediction for the

inverse Simpson index (Table S2). When the larger and indepen￾dently sampled validation sample set was similarly analyzed, using
the same four wcB weighting schemes, the convex increasing weigh￾ing scheme again provided the best prediction of the inverse Simpson
index. Analyses on 500 bootstrap samples from the validation set
demonstrated the stability of this wcB weighting scheme. The wcB
convex increasing weights were ranked as the best fit in 75% of the
bootstrap samples, outperforming the other choices, and were there￾fore used in the remainder of the study whenever wcB was
considered.
Weight component C. (wcC; Equation 5 in Materials and Methods)
accounts for the effects of antibiotic type and route of administration
on predicting the inverse Simpson index. Since only 16 of the 37
antibiotic types observed in the validation set were used in the train￾ing set, we based our initial evaluation of this weight component on
analyses of the combined training and validation sets. First, the abil￾ity of each antibiotic associated with a sputum sample (i.e., adminis￾tered within 30 days of sample collection) to predict the inverse
Simpson index was assessed, based on the wcA and wcB weighting
components and adjusting for age and %FEV1 at sampling. No sig￾nificant interactions between multiple antibiotics were detected.
Next, the AICs for the 37 antibiotic types were modeled and ranked
from lowest (best prediction model) to highest (worst prediction
model). Antibiotic type coefficients from the 37 AIC models were
also ranked based on largest to smallest impact on inverse Simpson
index (Table S3).
The AIC and coefficient ranks were summed and sorted from
lowest to highest and grouped into terciles. wcC values of 0.5, 0.33
or 0.17 were assigned to each combination of antibiotic type and
route of administration for the best, intermediate, and worst predic￾tors of the inverse Simpson index, respectively (Equation 5 in
Materials and Methods and Table S3). Antibiotics administered by
the IV route were more likely to be in the top tercile (i.e., wcC value of
0.5) than were antibiotics administered orally or by inhalation (50%
of IV administered antibiotics had wcC of 0.5 compared to 16% of
oral/inhaled antibiotics; Fisher’s exact test p 5 0.04).
The combined antibiotic weighting score (Equation 6 in Materials
and Methods) for each sputum sample was calculated by multiplying
wcA, wcB, and wcC for each of the 30 days prior to sputum collection
and then summing these scores across the 30 days. Inclusion of wcC
improved the prediction of community diversity (inverse Simpson
index) in each of the training, validation and combined sets as
opposed to using only wcA and wcB alone. A permutation test indi￾cated that inclusion of wcC in the combined antibiotic weighting
score gave a significantly lower AIC value (better model fit; p ,
0.001) than would have occurred under 5000 random permutations
of the wcC values across the 37 antibiotic types. The distribution of
the combined antibiotic load score across validation samples is
shown in Figure S2.
Predictors of community diversity in CF. To illustrate the utility of
the antibiotic weighting scoring schemes, we included the combined
antibiotic weighting score as a covariate in a multivariate model
Figure 1 | Antibiotic weight components (A) (wcA) and B (wcB). Panel (A) depicts daily wcA values for patient P2 during the 30 days prior to
collection of sample 27. This patient received four antibiotics during this time (tobramycin-IV, meropenem-IV, ciprofloxacin-PO, and doxycycline-PO).
A value of 1 indicates antibiotic administration on that day, while 0 indicates no antibiotic administration. Panel (B) depicts wcB profiles during the 30
days prior to sampling. These profiles indicate equal weighting (black) as well as linear (red), concave (blue), and convex (green) increasing weights as
days approach the sampling time. The data points for each profile (circles) were drawn based on values calculated by Equation 2 in the text and each value
was listed in Table S1.

predicting community diversities in our collection of CF sputum
samples. This allowed us to explore associations between bacterial
community diversity (inverse Simpson index) and the patient- and
sample-specific variables associated with these samples. Since disease
stage was defined based on lung function (%FEV1), these correlated
variables could not both be included in the model. We therefore
included disease stage as a covariate in the model since it has a
stronger predictive ability (AIC 1572.14) than lung function (AIC
1579.56).
Table 3 shows results from the multivariate linear mixed model
predicting the inverse Simpson index in the validation set. An
increase of one unit in the antibiotic weighting score calculated over
the month prior to sampling is associated with a 1.25 point decrease
in the inverse Simpson index on average (95% CI, 0.44, 2.05 point
decrease, p 5 0.002) after adjusting for dominant OTU, disease
severity, gender, CFTR genotype, disease stage, and patient age.
We observed significant differences in community diversity with
respect to dominant OTU (composite P , 0.001). Samples domi￾nated by Pseudomonas or Burkholderia showed the least diversity,
while samples dominated by Streptococcus showed the greatest
diversity (approximately 3 inverse Simpson index points higher than
Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, on average) after adjusting for age,
gender, disease severity, disease stage, CFTR genotype, and antibiotic
weighting in the previous month. On average, men had an approxi￾mately 1 point higher inverse Simpson index than women after
adjusting for other factors (p 5 0.004). We observed decreasing
diversity with advancing disease stage after adjusting for other fac￾tors; on average, early disease stage had a 1.15 point higher inverse
Simpson index than late disease stage (p 5 0.02). We did not observe
significant associations between community diversity and disease
severity or CFTR genotype after adjusting for age, gender, dominant
OTU, disease stage, and antibiotic use in the previous month. In
addition, we did not observe a significant decrease in diversity with
increasing age after adjusting for other factors.
Figure 2 shows the community diversity of a ‘‘standardized’’ CF
patient predicted by specific variables after adjusting for other vari￾ables. For example, after controlling for other variables, the estimated
community diversity is 5.7 if the community is dominated by
Streptococcus and 2.6 if dominated by Burkholderia.
Discussion
It is not unexpected that antibiotic administration perturbs bacterial
communities in human hosts, thereby confounding efforts to better
understand the microbial community signatures of disease progres￾sion, particularly in chronic diseases where prolonged and repeated
antibiotic use is required. Quantifying the impact of antibiotic ther￾apy on complex bacterial communities is challenging, involving a
myriad of variables such as dosing duration and timing relative to
sample collection, and antibiotic type and route of administration. In
this study, we propose a model to address this challenge by devel￾oping antibiotic weighting scores that account for these variables.
Using these scores, a combined antibiotic score can be calculated and
included as a covariate in multivariate models that assess other fac￾tors that may be important predictors of community structure. We
chose community diversity – as measured by the inverse Simpson
index – as the outcome parameter in this study. However, the prin￾ciples and approach we describe could be applied to account for
antibiotic use in analyses assessing predictors of any number of other
microbiota community outcome measures.
Weight component A takes into account the duration of antibiotic
administration. In our model we limited this only to antibiotic
administration in the 30 days prior to sample collection. This is an
admittedly arbitrary interval that could be modified in the model as
appropriate for other studies. Further, a defined interval such as this
does not account for cumulative antibiotic load that may have
accrued over very long intervals. Such use, involving potential ‘legacy
effects’ of prior antibiotic courses, could have a significant impact on
shaping human-associated microbiota. Although a comprehensive
accounting of long-term prior antibiotic use is often limited by the
unavailability of reliable medical records, the increasing use of
detailed electronic medical records may enable analyses of this sort
in future studies.
In accounting for the timing of antibiotic administration relative
to the sample date, (weight component B), antibiotic weighting based
on a convex increasing weighting scheme provided a better predic￾tion of community diversity than did the other schemes evaluated.
This expected result likely reflects community resilience after anti￾biotic perturbation; a longer interval between antibiotic administra￾tion and sampling provides greater opportunity for the recovery of

members of the community affected by the antibiotic. Thus, an anti￾biotic administered closer to the time of sampling would be expected
to have a greater impact on the microbial community than would
that same antibiotic administered at a longer interval from the sam￾pling time.
Specific antibiotic type is clearly a major component of any model
designed to account for variables impacting the effect of antibiotic
administration on human microbiota. We reasoned that route of
antibiotic administration would also impact antibiotic effect and
included this variable in our model as well. In developing this weight￾ing component, we assessed the bacterial communities in 478 spu￾tum samples from 66 persons with CF. Each combination of
antibiotic type and route of administration used to treat these indi￾viduals was provided a weight based on its ability to predict com￾munity diversity, our outcome measure of interest. As such, this
weighting was a function of the resistance of these communities to
the perturbation caused by the combinations of antibiotic type and
administration route included in our study. In studies of other
human-associated microbial communities, other combinations of
antibiotic type and route of administration would be expected to
have different impacts. Assigning weights to these combinations
therefore requires an analysis of a suitably sized data set relevant to
the microbiome being investigated.
We observed that, in general, antibiotic administration through an
IV route had a significantly higher probability of effecting a greater
change in community diversities, after controlling for subject age and
%FEV1 at the time of sampling, than did other routes of administra￾tion. This may be due, in part, to the broad spectrum antimicrobial
activities of agents such as cefepime and meropenem, which are
administered exclusively via an IV route. A more complete analysis
would need to take into account the antimicrobial susceptibilities of
all species detected with deep-sequencing, including those that are
not (or cannot be) routinely cultured in vitro.
To demonstrate the utility of modeling antibiotic use in studies
correlating the human microbiome and disease, we analyzed sets of
CF sputum samples for which we had determined bacterial com￾munity composition by deep sequencing. We included the antibiotic
weighting score assigned to each sample as a covariate, allowing us to
adjust for antibiotic use in a multivariate linear mixed model asses￾sing other potential predictors of bacterial community diversity. In
this analysis, we observed that community diversity was significantly
associated with the taxonomic affiliation of the dominant OTU.
Streptococcus dominated communities, for example, had signifi￾cantly higher diversities than communities dominated by either
Pseudomonas or Burkholderia, consistent with a recent study show￾ing greater community diversity and higher relative abundance of

Streptococcus in airway communities among outpatients with CF
compared to inpatients23. Our analysis also identified gender as a
significant predictor of CF airway community diversity, with females
having lower diversities than males. The adjustment for antibiotic
use, as well as age, disease stage and the other variables included in
the model suggests additional unidentified factors that reduce airway
community diversity in women compared to men24. Disease severity
in CF describes the rate of lung function decline relative to patient
age22. In our analysis, after adjusting for antibiotic use and other
variables, disease aggressiveness was not found to be significantly
associated with community diversity, suggesting either that a larger
sample size is needed to detect such an association or that other
factors, most likely host-associated variables, play critical roles in
CF lung disease progression. An important observation in our ana￾lysis was that antibiotic use was found to be an independent predictor
of decreased CF airway bacterial community diversity. The correla￾tion between decreasing airway community diversity and lung dis￾ease progression in CF has been noted in several recent studies21,25–27;
however, the causal relationship between decreasing diversity and
decreasing lung function has been the subject of controversy28. The
results of our study support our previous observation suggesting that
decreasing airway community diversity is driven primarily by anti￾biotic therapy21.
In summary, we have described an approach to account for anti￾biotic exposure in studies examining the relationships between
human microbiota and disease. More specifically, we propose a
scheme, based on weighing variables associated with antibiotic use,
to develop an antibiotic score that, in turn, can be included as a
covariate in models exploring correlations between bacterial com￾munities and human disease progression, particularly in conditions
associated with repeated antibiotic therapy. We applied this scheme
in a multivariate analysis of potential predictors of bacterial airway
community diversity in a large cohort of persons with CF. Our find￾ings sharpen previous observations of associations between decreased
airway community diversity, lung disease progression, and variables
such as gender and dominant community OTU. We show that anti￾biotic therapy is an independent predictor of decreased airway com￾munity diversity in CF. We expect that the specific weighting
schemes we developed for our dataset will need to be modified to
best suit studies of other disease conditions. Nevertheless, we pro￾pose that the approach we describe will have broad applicability to
such studies.
Methods
Patients and clinical samples. A total of 478 sputum samples, collected from 66
adults with CF receiving care at the University of Michigan Health System, were
included in this study. Sample collection and medical record review were approved by
the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board, which waived the
requirement for informed consent. Sputum specimens were collected during the
course of routine medical care and stored at 280uC in 0.5 mL aliquots as described
previously21. A minority proportion of the samples was relegated for exploratory
analysis. This training data set consisted of 116 sputum samples collected from six
male CF patients during periods of 8 to 9 years as described previously21. The majority
of sputum samples was used for validation analyses; this validation data set consisted
of 362 sputum samples from 60 patients not included in the training data set.
Sputum DNA extraction and pyrosequencing. DNA extraction and
pyrosequencing were performed as described previously21. Briefly, sputum aliquots
were thawed on ice and homogenized with 0.5 mL SputolysinH (EMD Chemicals, San
Diego, CA) before DNA was purified by an automated nucleic acid purification
platform (MagNA Pure Compact System, Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The 16S rDNA V3–V5 region was amplified with bar-coded
primers and sequenced by the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College
of Medicine using protocols developed for the Human Microbiome Project (http://
www.hmpdacc.org/tools_protocols/tools_protocols.php) as described17.
DNA sequence processing and analysis. Raw sequences were analyzed using mothur
v1.2429. Reads were denoised by the PyroNoise component of the AmpliconNoise
suite of programs30. Sequences containing homopolymers greater than 8 bp, 1
mismatch in the barcode or 2 in the primer, one or more ambiguous bases were
removed. Remaining sequences that were at least 200 bp but less than 590 bp in
length were further curated to remove chimeric sequences using UCHIME31 and to
further reduce sequencing noise by a preclustering methodology32 before being
assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using an average neighbor algorithm
with a 0.03 dissimilarity cutoff. The total number of reads for each community was
first normalized to 568, the smallest number of reads among the 478 samples by
random sampling, to control for differences in sequencing depth before calculation of
community diversity.
Statistical methods. The inverse Simpson index33 was calculated and used as a
measure of bacterial community diversity and was modeled via linear mixed models
(IBM SPSS Statistics package version 20) so that associations between predictors and
community measures would take into account autocorrelation of repeated samples
from the same individual. The training data set was used to study the effects of the
duration of antibiotic administration and the proximity of administration to the time
of sample collection. Both the training and validation data sets were used to assess the
effects of antibiotic type and route of administration on community measures. The
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to compare the predictive value of
antibiotic weighting definitions applied to the training and validation data in
developing the final antibiotic weighting scheme; since sample size affects AIC values,
these comparisons were only made within models of the same cohort. Using the
validation data set, mixed model analyses studied multivariate associations between
the final antibiotic weighting scheme and community measures, accounting for other
clinical factors of interest.
