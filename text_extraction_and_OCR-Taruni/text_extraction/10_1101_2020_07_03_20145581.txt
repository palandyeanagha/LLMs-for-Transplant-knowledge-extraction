Summary 
With the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic coupled with phased 
reopening, it is critical to identify risk factors associated with susceptibility and severity of 
disease in a diverse population to help shape government policies, guide clinical decision 
making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research. In this retrospective case-control study, we 
used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles 
(UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for 
COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV￾2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care 
unit or intubation). Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID￾19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 
77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and 
individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, 
individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID￾19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of 
those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co￾morbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk 
factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less 
well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds 
ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 x 10-10), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6-2.8], 
p=1.1 x 10-6) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 x 10-6). Renal diseases including 
end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant 
premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for 
COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8-39], p=3.2x10-4) 
and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7x10-4). Prior use of oral steroid 
medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45,

0.81], p=4.3x10-4), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8x10-5). We did 
not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor 
blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or 
having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less 
well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID￾19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked 
ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk 
populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.

Introduction 
Global cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reached 9.8 million in June 2020, 
with the United States accounting for 2.4 million cases1,2. While still in the midst of the first acute 
phase of the pandemic2–4, knowledge of risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility 
and severity can shape government policies, identify at-risk populations, guide clinical decision 
making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research. Existing studies have identified risk factors in 
hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are associated with death, intensive care unit admission or 
ventilation. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and diabetes have consistently 
been identified as risk factors for a severe outcome in hospitalized patients in China, Italy and 
the United States5–14. On the other hand, there have been limited analyses on risk factors that 
confer an increased susceptibility for being diagnosed with COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity), and inpatient admission, both of which are 
important stages of the COVID-19 disease spectrum. In addition, data collection in previous 
studies were predominantly performed via standardized forms from electronic health records 
(EHR)8,14,15 or registry data reported to centralized coordinating centers7,12. These data are 
standardized, less detailed, and have limited access to records from previous encounters 
compared to direct EHR extraction6,16.
 In addition, certain COVID-19 risk factors may be emphasized based on study design 
and vary due to the geographical and population context17. Within California, Los Angeles 
County has seven times more COVID-19 cases (93,000) compared to the second ranked 
county18. Los Angeles comprises a racially and ethnic diverse population with 48% self￾identified Hispanic or Latinos, 15% Asians, and 9% Black or African Americans spread over 
4,000 square miles19. With hospitals and clinics predominantly located in Los Angeles County, 
the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System cares for individuals from this 
community. In this retrospective study, our objective was to identify pre-existing risk factors for 
COVID-19 diagnosis susceptibility, inpatient admission, and severe outcome through the

Results
Study Subjects 
The UCLA Health System includes two hospitals (520 and 281 inpatient beds) and 210 primary 
and specialty outpatient locations predominantly located in Los Angeles County. We leveraged 
an extract of the de-identified electronic health records from the UCLA Health System known as 
the Data Discovery Repository (DDR), which contains longitudinal records for more than 1.5 
million patients since 2013. 
This retrospective analysis included individuals who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via 
RT-PCR within the UCLA Health System between March 9, 2020 and June 14, 2020, where the 
first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was on March 12, 2020. Of the 26,602 individuals PCR 
tested for SARS-CoV-2 (Tested) (55% female, 44% male; mean (standard deviation, SD) 49 
(20) years old), 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested; 51% female, 48% male; mean 
(SD) 49 (20) years old), 220 were admitted in the hospital (Inpatient) (22% of COVID-19 
positive; 43% female, 56% male; mean (SD) 62 (21) years old) and 77 were treated in the 
intensive care unit or required intubation (Severe) (7.7% of COVID-19 positive, 35% of Inpatient; 
38% female, 61% male; mean (SD) 56 (20) years old) (Figure 1). 
Demographics 
Compared to all tested patients, COVID-19 positive patients were significantly more likely to be 
male (48% male COVID-19 positive vs. 44% male Tested; odds ratio (OR) = 1.2 [1.0, 1.3]; 
p=0.02), and adults (2% <18 years old COVID-19 positive vs. 6% <18 years old Tested; OR = 
0.40 [0.26, 0.57]; p<0.001). Compared to COVID-19 positive patients, inpatients were more 
likely male (56% male Inpatients vs. 48% male COVID-19 positive; OR = 1.5 [1.1, 2.0]; p=6.0 x 
10-3) and older than 65 years old (49% >65 years old Inpatient vs. 20% >65 years old COVID-19 
positive; OR = 6.9 [4.9, 9.7]; p<0.001) (Table 1). These findings confirm previous reports that 
males and non-young individuals face higher risks of severe disease21–23.

However, in our dataset, both older (>65 years old) and intermediate (26-55 year old) 
age groups had an increased risk of a severe outcome depending on the comparison group. 
The percentage of Severe individuals >65 years old (35%) was higher than the percentage of 
COVID-positive individuals >65 years old (20%), but lower than the percentage of Inpatient 
individuals >65 years old (35% >65 years old Severe vs. 49% >65 years old Inpatients; OR = 
0.41 [0.23, 0.71]; p=1.6 x 10-3). In contrast, the percentage of Severe individuals 26-55 years old 
(37%) was lower than the percentage of COVID-positive individuals 26-55 years old (55%), but 
higher than the percentage of Inpatient individuals 26-55 years old (37% 26-55 year old Severe 
vs. 27% 26-55 year old Inpatient; OR = 2.1 [1.1, 3.8]; p=0.016) (Table 1). These data show that 
the intermediate age group has a lower risk of inpatient admission, but higher risk of a severe 
outcome if admitted. 
 Self-identified Hispanic or Latino individuals constituted an increasing percentage of 
COVID-19 patients as disease severity increased. While Hispanic or Latino individuals 
comprised 16% of the Tested population, they comprised 24% of COVID-19 positive individuals 
(24% COVID-19 positive vs. 16% Tested; OR = 2.0 [1.7, 2.3]; p<0.001), 33% of Inpatient 
individuals (33% Inpatient vs. 24% COVID-19 positive; OR = 2.1 [1.4, 3.1]; p<0.001), and 40% 
of Severe individuals (40% Severe vs. 33% COVID-19 positive; OR = 1.3 [0.7, 2.4]; p=0.43) 
(Table 1). These findings show that self-identified Hispanic or Latino individuals had a higher 
risk of testing positive, and that when positive, suffered from more severe COVID-19 disease. 
To evaluate if co-morbidities contributed to the disproportionate COVID-19 disease 
severity in Hispanic or Latino individuals, we next corrected for patient histories of known 
COVID-19 risk factors such as type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and 
chronic renal disease (Methods, Table S1), many of which are known to disproportionately 
affect Hispanic or Latino individuals24,25. The odds ratio for having a positive test remained >2.0 
in Hispanic or Latino individuals, and for having a Severe disease course remained >2.7 (Table 
S2). These findings support that individuals who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino have risk

factors, other than medical, that increase their risk of having COVID-19 disease and a severe 
outcome26. 
Overall, individuals self-identifying as non-white (Asian, Black or African American, 
American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Other Race) 
showed increased COVID-19 susceptibility (39% COVID-19 positive vs 35% Tested, OR = 1.5 
[1.3, 1.7]; p<0.001) and Inpatient admission (51% Inpatient vs 39% COVID-19 positive, OR = 
1.7 [1.2, 2.4]; p=0.002). African American individuals had a significantly increased COVID-19 
susceptibility risk (8% COVID-19 positive vs 7% Tested, OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.6]; p=0.03) and a 
similar, non-significant increased risk for COVID-19 inpatient admission and severe outcome 
(11% Inpatient, 16% Severe) (Table 1). These findings show that self-identified non-white 
individuals had a higher risk of COVID-19 disease. 
Prior Diagnoses as COVID-19 Risk Factors 
To identify diagnoses that were risk factors for COVID-19 severity groups, we analyzed 
diagnoses entered in the EHR prior to an individual’s SARS-CoV-2 testing. ICD codes were 
mapped to ~1,800 phecodes, which have been shown to represent meaningful and interpretable 
phenotypes20. We sought COVID-19 susceptibility risk factors by comparing COVID-19 positive 
individuals to a random sampling of 10,000 individuals who were age- and sex-matched and 
drawn from the DDR cohort. In addition, we analyzed the presence of prior diagnoses between 
the COVID-19 positive Inpatient group compared to the COVID-19 positive Outpatient group 
and between the COVID-19 positive inpatient Severe group compared to COVID-19 positive 
inpatient not Severe group (Figure 1). 
Three hundred eighty-six phecodes present prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing were 
associated with COVID-19 diagnosis susceptibility and included known risk factors such as 
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and chronic renal 
disease (Table S3) when adjusting for age and sex (Methods). To identify phenotypic risk

factors not correlated with and not already explained by major known COVID-19 risk factors, we 
controlled for these major known COVID-19 risk factors (coronary heart disease, congestive 
heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, obesity, and chronic renal disease7,8,10,13–15,27). We identified 80 phecodes 
observed prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing that were associated with COVID-19 susceptibility 
(Figure 2, Table S4). Less well-established significant COVID-19 diagnosis susceptibility risk 
factors included dementias (dementia (OR 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 x 10-10), Alzheimer’s disease (OR 
7.7 [3.9-15], p=1.2 x 10-8)), mental health conditions (major depressive disorder (OR 2.1 [1.6-
2.8], p=1.1 x 10-6), anxiety disorder (OR 1.7 [1.4, 2.0], p=5.3 x 10-7)), and vitamin D deficiency 
(OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 x 10-6) (Figure 2, Table S4). 
Individuals with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease may be at greater risk of contracting 
COVID-19 as they are older and have more comorbidities28. In the DDR sample, patients over 
65 years old with dementia have on average 2.3 known risk factors (standard deviation (SD) = 
1.8) versus patients over 65 years old without dementia who have on average 0.98 known risk 
factors (SD = 1.4) (p<0.001). However, these comorbidities are less likely to confound these 
analyses, as we controlled for age and known comorbid risk factors. Individuals with dementia 
may also have limited access to accurate information and live in facilities that have high 
infection rates28–32. 
Mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety, have not been described as 
prior risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility. This may be due to the known association of 
mental health conditions and health outcomes including pneumonia and barriers to accessing 
health care33,34. We evaluated if these mental health associations were present in the UCLA 
Health system. Using the DDR Sample controlling for age and sex, we found that both 
depression and anxiety were positively associated with risk of influenza (depression OR 4.5 
[2.6, 7.1], p<0.001; anxiety OR 2.2 [1.4, 3.2], p<0.001). Access to health care was likely not a 
contributing factor in our health system as patients with depression or anxiety compared to

those without depression or anxiety had a greater number of health system encounters, after 
controlling for age and sex (20 encounters per year depression or anxiety vs 10 encounters per 
year without depression or anxiety, OR per 10 encounters per year 1.5 [1.4, 1.6], p<0.001). 
The association of low vitamin D levels with COVID-19 disease has been proposed 
because rates of infection are higher in countries at higher latitudes35–37. To further investigate if 
vitamin D insufficiency was associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, we evaluated 25-
hydroxyvitamin D laboratory values. Indeed, we found that the minimum level of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D one year prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing was significantly lower in COVID-19 
positive cases compared to the DDR sample, when correcting for age and sex (mean (SD) 29.1 
ng/mL (11.7) COVID-19 positive vs 30.4 ng/mL (13.0), OR per 5 ng/mL 0.92 [0.84, 0.99], 
p=0.045), but not significant after correcting for age, sex and known risk factors (OR per 5 
ng/mL 0.99 [0.88, 1.0], p=0.28) (Methods). These differences in vitamin D levels may not be 
clinically significant at an individual level, but support that vitamin D deficiency across the cohort 
increases the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. 
Additional significant prior risk factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosis susceptibility 
included phecodes representing common symptoms of COVID-198,9,15. These included 
respiratory symptoms (cough (OR 2.7 [2.3, 3.3], p<2.2 x 10-16)), musculoskeletal symptoms 
(chronic pain (OR 1.9 [1.5, 2.3], p=7.2 x 10-8), and malaise and fatigue (OR 1.9 [1.5, 2.4], p=3.3 
x 10-8)) (Figure 2, Table S4). 
Phecodes present prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing significantly associated with the COVID￾19 positive Inpatient group were renal disease (renal dialysis, acute renal failure), respiratory 
disease (pneumonia, pleurisy), and sepsis (Table S5). Controlling for known risk factors, 22 
significant phecodes were identified as risk factors for the COVID-19 positive Inpatient group. 
Among these, less well-established risk factors included individuals with a history of acidosis 
(OR 7.4 [3.1, 18], 6.9x10-6), sepsis (OR 8.4 [3.9, 19], p=2.5x10-8), kidney replaced by renal

transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8, 39], p=3.2x10-4), and disorders involving the immune mechanism (OR 
6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7x10-4) (Figure 2, Table S6). 
As acidosis and sepsis are typically diagnosed during relatively severe inpatient 
admissions, these factors may represent patients with a severe hospitalization prior to SARS￾CoV-2 testing. Previous studies suggested a more rapid COVID-19 clinical progression in renal 
transplant patients38–40, but they did not investigate if renal transplant was associated with 
increased COVID-19 inpatient admission risk. Lastly, the “disorders involving the immune 
mechanism” phecode maps to ICD codes including miscellaneous immunodeficiency diseases 
(but not including humoral or T-cell defects). Immunodeficiency has yet to be shown as a 
COVID-19 risk factor for inpatient admission. 
Even after controlling for chronic renal disease and other major known COVID-19 risk 
factors, multiple phenotypes associated with renal disease remained significantly associated 
with COVID-19 inpatient admission risk including kidney replaced by renal transplant as 
described above, acute renal failure (OR 4.4 [2.0, 9.7], p=1.5x10-4), renal dialysis (OR 11 [3.5, 
39], p=2.5x10-5), and anemia in chronic kidney disease (OR 16 [4.8, 63], p=2.2x10-6) (Figure 2, 
Table S6). 
A previous history of thrombocytopenia was also significantly associated with COVID-19 
inpatient admission risk (OR 4.1 [1.9, 8.8], p=1.3x10-4). Many prior studies showed that 
thrombocytopenia during hospitalization is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcome8,9,15,41,42. 
We confirmed via laboratory test results that the minimum platelet level one year prior to SARS￾CoV-2 testing was lower in COVID-19 inpatient cases compared to the COVID-19 outpatient 
cases, when correcting for sex, age and known risk factors (mean (SD) 173 x103

COVID-19 Inpatient vs 240 ng/mL (66) COVID-19 Outpatient; OR per 10 x103

We did not find any phecodes significantly associated with the COVID-19 Severe group, 
although our power was low (N=56 COVID-19 positive with Severe outcome and at least one 
encounter prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing) compared to the COVID-19 Inpatient group (N=177) 
and COVID-19 positive group (N=843). 
Prior Renal Diagnoses as COVID-19 Risk Factors
Given the strong association of additional renal diseases with COVID-19 risk of 
hospitalization even after controlling for chronic renal disease and other major known COVID-19 
risk factors, we performed a detailed analysis of renal diseases. We investigated renal disease 
categories of: chronic renal disease, acute renal disease, end stage renal disease, anemia due 
to chronic renal disease, and renal transplant (See Table S7 for phecodes assigned to renal 
disease categories). Individuals with “any renal disease category” had at least one phecode 
corresponding the renal disease categories. We controlled for non-renal major known risk 
factors (coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity) to determine the association of each 
renal disease category with COVID-19 diagnosis susceptibility and inpatient admission risk. As 
expected, all renal disease categories were significantly associated with COVID-19 inpatient 
risk. In addition, chronic renal disease, end-stage renal disease, anemia in chronic renal 
disease, and any renal disease category were significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis 
susceptibility, suggesting multiple renal diseases are risk factors for both COVID-19 diagnosis 
susceptibility and inpatient admission risk (Table 2). 
 
Extremes of COVID-19 severity susceptibility or resistance

comorbidities (<25 years old), but who were admitted as an inpatient, and 2) older patients with 
high risk for a serious COVID-19 clinical course (>70 years old with at least three of the 
following: history of renal disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and 
hypertension) with no inpatient admission. These patients may represent extremes of COVID-19 
susceptibility and resistance, and therefore may carry genetic immunological susceptibilities or 
resistances to infection43–46. Out of the 77 young individuals with no major comorbidities, 7 (9%) 
were admitted to the hospital. Out of the 73 older individuals with a high risk for inpatient 
admission, 23 (30%) were not admitted to the hospital.
Prior Medications Associated with COVID-19 
Controversy remains over the protective or detrimental effects of medication classes 
including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARB)47–49, immunosuppressants50–54, steroids55,56, anticoagulants57–59, and non-steroidal anti￾inflammatory drugs60. We investigated whether the use of these medications 90 days prior to 
SARS-CoV-2 testing (See Table S8 for drugs assigned to each medication class) was 
associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, inpatient admission, or severe outcome while 
controlling for age, sex and known risk factors (Methods). Comparing COVID-19 positive to 
negative individuals, those prescribed oral steroids had a decreased risk of being diagnosed 
with COVID-19 (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p<0.001). However, being prescribed oral steroids (OR 
4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p<0.001) or other immunosuppressants (OR 4.1 [1.8, 9.0], p<0.001) increased the 
risk of inpatient admission. We did not observe that being prescribed ACEI or ARBs increased 
the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe 
course, as recently reported48 (Figure 1, Table 3).

Discussion 
Identifying COVID-19 risk factors along the entire disease spectrum can inform patient care, 
public policies, and future research aimed at improving outcomes and reducing health care 
disparities. We leveraged our ability to query a de-identified electronic health records to 
determine COVID-19 risk factors in the UCLA Health System61. We found previously reported 
health disparities in the Hispanic or Latino, and non-white populations and confirmed known co￾morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and chronic renal disease that are risk factors for 
COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. We also identified several less well￾established risk factors such as pre-existing dementia, depression, vitamin D deficiency, and 
previous renal transplant. Furthermore, we found that immunosuppressive medication was 
associated with a decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk, but an increased inpatient 
admission risk. 
This study differs from previous studies in that it was performed with direct EHR 
extraction as opposed to cases series, manual extraction, standardized form extraction from 
electronic health records, or registries7,8,10,12,14,15,62, allowing detailed phenotyping from extended 
historical data. Recent preprints have used direct EHR extraction from collaborations between 
the United States and South Korea16 and the United Kingdom6
. The detailed phenotyping and 
increased power from these studies identified COVID-19 mortality risk factors in the United 
Kingdom not reported in manual EHR extraction studies including stroke, dementia, and 
autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis). 
Significant risk factors for becoming critically ill (intensive care unit admission or death) 
among hospitalized COVID-19 patients include older age, cardiac disease (cardiac injury, 
coronary artery disease), pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute 
respiratory distress syndrome), renal disease (chronic renal disease, acute kidney injury), 
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity9–11,14,63,64. Previously reported comorbid risk

factors for severe outcome in COVID-19 hospitalized patients are also prior risk factors for 
COVID-19 diagnosis susceptibility and inpatient admission in our study. However, we find risk 
factors that are distinct to COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. For example, the 
risk of testing positive for COVID-19 increased with cardiovascular disease (coronary artery 
disease, congestive heart failure), hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia while risk factors for 
inpatient admission, were predominantly renal disorders (chronic renal failure, acute renal 
failure) and thrombocytopenia, the latter of which was confirmed via laboratory test results. 
We identified prior risk factors that are less well-established for COVID-19 susceptibility 
including dementia, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and vitamin D deficiency. 
Individuals with dementia may be at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 as they are older and 
have more comorbidities, although we corrected for these in our analysis. We suspect that other 
environmental factors are contributing, including living in facilities which have had high infection 
rates, difficulty adhering to public health recommendations and limited access to accurate 
information28–32. 
Studies on the mental health impact of COVID-19 have shown an increased rate of 
depressive symptoms65,66. Depression and anxiety as prior risk factors for COVID-19 
susceptibility have not been previously described. Previous studies have correlated mental 
health condition with respiratory disease including pneumonia and pneumococcal disease33. We 
confirmed in the UCLA health system that individuals with depression and anxiety have an 
increased risk of influenza. These associations may be due to diminished effort for personal 
protection and barriers to accessing health care33,34, although we did not find that patients with 
depression or anxiety had less UCLA Health System encounters. Given that dementia and 
mental health conditions are risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility, healthcare organizations 
and communities should consider strategies in addition to social distancing to reduce this risk, 
as social distancing may contribute to the risk67.

There has been speculation using country-wide aggregate data that low vitamin D may 
be associated with COVID-19, as rates of infection are higher in countries at higher latitudes35–
37. While there are many other explanations for this latitude effect (e.g. rates of testing, global 
patterns of spread), here, we show using individual patient data that vitamin D deficiency is 
associated with increased COVID-19 susceptibility risk. A recent preprint showed that low 
serum 25-hydroxycholecalcifoerol was more prevalent in ICU compared to non-ICU hospitalized 
patients68. We confirmed the association of vitamin D insufficiency with COVID-19 susceptibility 
using 25-hydroxyvitamin D laboratory levels when correcting for age and sex, but not when 
correcting for known risk factors. We did not evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation would 
be protective. 
Less well-established inpatient admission prior risk factors included renal transplant and 
disorders involving the immune mechanism. Studies from Italy, New York, and China have 
reported the clinical course of hospitalized renal transplant patients with COVID-19 suggesting 
some may have a more rapid clinical progression38–40. Our study also shows that renal 
transplant patients have an increased risk of inpatient admission with COVID-19. 
While there is controversy over whether immunosuppressant medication increases risk 
of COVID-19 severity50–54, we found that individuals with the “disorders involving the immune 
mechanism” phecode, which maps to ICD codes including immunodeficiency, were at increased 
risk of inpatient admission. Further studies are warranted to determine if other clinical 
characteristics of this patient group increase the risk of COVID-19 severity and if there are 
mechanistic links. 
In our study cohort, older age was not a risk factor for all stages of the COVID-19 
disease spectrum. Individuals older than 65 years old were more likely to be admitted, but made 
up a lower percentage of individuals experiencing a severe outcome. As a corollary, young age 
was not completely protective, as those in the intermediate age group between 26 and 55 years 
old were more likely to have a severe outcome once admitted. Studies from the CDC and New

York showed intensive care unit admission or ventilation was lower in intermediate age groups 
compared to older age groups69–71, in contrast to our study. In the UCLA Health System, it is 
possible clinicians have a lower threshold of inpatient admission for older individuals, preferring 
to monitor their COVID-19 clinical course. However, less of these admitted older individuals 
progress to severe disease. Clinicians may have a higher threshold for admitting intermediate 
age group individuals where those admitted may have more significant COVID-19 symptoms. 
Therefore, once admitted intermediate age group individuals are more likely to progress to 
severe disease. Risk factors other than age and co-morbidities likely also contribute to COVID￾19 severe outcomes. These risk factors may be environmental such as air pollution72, 
socioeconomic such as access to health care26,73, and genetic43,74. 
The increased COVID-19 disease susceptibility and severity risk in individuals with self￾identified Hispanic or Latino ethnicity further highlights health disparities in COVID-19. We found 
a similar association in individuals with self-identified race other than White or Caucasian and 
self-identified Black or African American race. The Los Angeles County of Public Health has 
confirmed these disparities; the age-adjusted rate of COVID-19 cases is over 100 per 100,000 
individuals for these minority groups but only 78 for those who self-identify as white, non￾hispanic22. Similar findings have been found by the New York City Health Department and 
Chicago Department of Public health where the rates of COVID-19 cases and severe outcomes 
are roughly double in Black and Hispanic or Latino individuals compared to White 
individuals21,23. Other studies from Connecticut and a 14 state public health COVID-19 
surveillance network (COVID-NET) including California predominantly found risk of COVID-19 
susceptibility and hospitalization in Black individuals70,75. As we are unable to appropriately 
assess socioeconomic status using the available EHR data, ethnic discrepancy may be due to 
this and other associated variables76. For example, shelter-in-place guidelines are most 
burdensome to Hispanic or Latino individuals in Los Angeles County as many live in

neighborhoods with densely populated communities and have limited access to both open 
spaces and nearby supermarkets26. 
There has been concern that some individuals with COVID-19 have an exaggerated 
immune response resulting in cytokine storm or secondary haemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis, and studies have suggested that short-term immunosuppression is 
warranted51,54,77. Previous studies investigated small numbers of COVID-19 positive patients 
(<4) on immunosuppression prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, finding that these patients in general 
did well and did not have a severe outcome50,52,53. Here we analyzed over 80 patients on either 
oral steroids or other immunosuppressants. Individuals on oral steroids had a decreased 
COVID-19 positive testing rate, but an increased inpatient admission risk. The explanation for 
this may be biological, behavioral, or partially due to clinician bias. It is possible 
immunosuppression results in asymptomatic COVID-19, thus lowering numbers of 
immunosuppressed individuals who seek testing and therefore test positive. However, if 
positive, these individuals have severe symptoms requiring admission. Another explanation is 
that clinicians lower their threshold for inpatient admission for patients on immunosuppression. 
We did not assess whether immunosuppressive medication was stopped, continued or changed 
on admission, and therefore, we are unable to draw conclusions on whether to adjust 
immunosuppression in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. 
This study identifies important and less established risk factors for susceptibility and 
severity of outcomes in COVID-19. These risk factors should spur future work in understanding 
the mechanistic underpinnings of these observations and implementing strategies to mitigate 
both biological and socioeconomic risk factors.

Methods 
Study design 
This was an observational case-control study within a cohort of patients registered at the UCLA 
Health System after January 1, 2013. The UCLA Health System includes two hospitals (520 and 
281 inpatient beds) and 210 primary and specialty outpatient locations predominantly located in 
Los Angeles County. We leveraged an extract of the de-identified EHR from the UCLA Health 
System known as the UCLA Data Discovery Repository (DDR), developed under the auspices 
of the UCLA Health Office of Health Informatics Analytics and the UCLA Institute of Precision 
Health. The DDR contains longitudinal electronic records for more than 1.5 million patients since 
2013, including patient demographics, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, 
and laboratory data. This study was considered human subjects research exempt because all 
electronic health records were de-identified (UCLA IRB# 20-001180). 
Outcomes and Case/Control Selection 
From March 9, 2020 to June 14, 2020, 26,602 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) within the UCLA Health System. 
Three different levels of COVID-19 outcome were defined (Figure 1). 
COVID-19 positive cases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result 
(COVID-19 positive). To determine individuals with SARS-CoV-2 testing, lab tests in the DDR 
were searched for “SARS-CoV-2” or “COVID-19”. The list of tests was manually reviewed to 
determine which tests were PCR based. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in our hospital system 
reported positive tests as “positive” or “detected” and negative tests as “negative” or “not 
detected”. Other lab values such as “unknown” or “NULL” were considered unknown. Some 
individuals had more than one SARS-CoV-2 PCR test; in these cases, individuals were 
considered COVID-19 positive if they had at least one positive test. The controls for COVID-19

(DDR Sample). To study whether medications taken prior to COVID-19 testing were associated 
with COVID-19 diagnosis, we examined the 90-day window prior to the test. This window 
necessitated comparison to COVID-19 negative individuals as controls (COVID-19 negative). 
Inpatient cases were those who had a hospital admission within 14 days of their first 
positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (Inpatients). This time window was selected to identify 
individuals whose symptoms may not have been severe at initial testing, but may have 
progressed in severity warranting inpatient admission. The controls for inpatient cases were 
those who tested positive for COVD-19, but were not admitted as inpatient within 14 days of 
their first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (Outpatients). 
Severe cases were those who were admitted to an intensive care unit or were intubated 
within 14 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (Severe). Intubation was determined 
by CPT codes (94656, 94657, 94662, 1120200004, 1120200012) and codes custom to the 
UCLA EHR (Table S9). The controls for Severe cases were those who had a hospital admission 
within 14 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, but were not admitted to an 
intensive care unit and not intubated during the 14-day window (Inpatient Not Severe). 
For prior diagnoses, lab and medication association test, cases and controls were 
excluded if their records were missing age, missing sex, or had no encounter in the UCLA 
Health System prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. 
Confounding variables 
We treated sex, age, age^2 and prior diagnoses of major known COVID-19 risk factors 
(coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and chronic renal disease7,8,10,13–15) as potential 
confounders and adjusted for all or a subset of them depending on the analyses (see Table S1

for phecodes assigned to risk factors). For all analyses using 10,000 DDR individuals, the 
matching factor age group was also included as a potential confounder. 
Statistical Analysis 
Demographics 
Age, sex, race and ethnicity were stratified by the Tested, COVID-19 positive, Inpatient and 
Severe groups. For age groups and sex, percentages of Severe was compared to Inpatient, 
Inpatient was compared to COVID-19 positive, and COVID-19 positive was compared to Tested 
using a Fisher’s exact test78. Age groups were: <18 years, 19-25 years, 26-55 years, 56-65 
years, and >65 years. Significant association of race and ethnicity in a COVID-19 outcome was 
analyzed in the following Firth logistic regression models79. 
logit(outcome)=β0 + β1race + β2age_group + β3sex 
and 
logit(outcome)= β0 + β1ethnicity + β2age_group + β3sex 
Outcome for Severe was considered Inpatient Severe vs. Inpatient Not Severe; for Inpatient 
was considered COVID-19 positive Inpatient vs COVID-19 positive Outpatient; and for COVID￾19 positive was considered COVID-19 positive vs. COVID-19 negative. Individuals with 
unknown race and unknown ethnicity were excluded from these analyses. 
For Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, we also corrected for patient histories of known risk 
factors (coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and chronic renal disease) (see Table 
S1 for phecodes assigned to risk factors) using the model:

Prior Diagnoses as COVID-19 Risk Factors 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes were 
mapped to 1866 phecodes, which represent meaningful and interpretable phenotypes20,80. We 
calculated the odds ratio of all phecodes correcting for age and sex (Model 1) using the Firth 
logistic regression model81,82 to account for phecodes with no counts within an outcome group 
as follows: 
(Model 1) logit(outcome)=β0 + β1age + β2age2
 + β3sex + β4phecode 
Outcome for Severe was considered Inpatient Severe vs. Inpatient Not Severe; for Inpatient 
was considered COVID-19 positive Inpatient vs COVID-19 positive Outpatient; and for COVID￾19 positive was considered COVID-19 positive vs. the DDR Sample. 
For COVID-19 positive compared to the DDR Sample, we added an age group 
covariate. Age group, age and age squared are included in the model to correct for residual 
confounding effects of age due to possible non-linear effect. We used the likelihood ratio test to 
test for phecode significance79. Multiple hypothesis testing correction was performed 
conservatively using a Bonferroni correction for the number of phecodes tested83. Nominal p￾values are reported. 
To account for major known risk factors (coronary heart disease, congestive heart 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,

obesity, and chronic renal disease), we tested Bonferroni significant phecodes from Model 1 in 
Model 2 using the Firth logistic regression model as follows: 
 
(Model 2) logit(outcome)=β0 + β1age + β2age2
 + β3sex + 
β4coronary_artery_disease + β5congestive_heart_failure + 
β6chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease + β7type_2_diabetes + 
β8hyperlipidemia + β9hypertension + β10obesity + β11chronic_renal_disease 
+ β12phecode 
For COVID-19 positive compared to the DDR Sample, we added an age group covariate. 
Bonferroni correction was performed for the number of phecodes tested in Model 2. 
We performed secondary analyses for significant risk factors associated with COVID-19 
susceptibility and inpatient admission. Because dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were 
associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, we determined if dementia patients had more known 
risk factors. From the DDR sample, we calculated the mean number of known risk factors for 
patients over 65 years old with the dementia phecode (290.1) and patients over 65 years old 
without the dementia phecode. We compared these groups using the Wilcoxan rank sum test. 
Because the mental health conditions, depression and anxiety, were associated with 
COVID-19 susceptibility, we determined if previously described explanations may account for 
this association. We determined if depression (phecode 296.22) and anxiety (phecode 300.10) 
were associated with influenza (phecode 418.00) in the DDR Sample in following Firth logistic 
regression model and used the likelihood ratio test: 
logit(influenza)=β0 + β1age + β2age2
 + β4age_group + β4sex + β5depression 
and 
logit(influenza)=β0 + β1age + β2age2

 As a proxy for access to health care, we determined if the number of encounters per 
year was associated with depression or anxiety in the DDR Sample. We considered encounters 
after 2013 as this was when the EHR was implemented. The total number of encounters for an 
individual was defined as the number of encounters with unique dates. This prevented counting 
multiple encounters on the same date more than once. Individuals were included if the first and 
last encounter in the EHR was at least 6 months apart. 5613 of the 10,000 individuals in the 
DDR Sample met these criteria. We tested the association of number of encounters per year 
with depression or anxiety in the following Firth logistic regression model and used the likelihood 
ratio test: 
logit(depression or anxiety)=β0 + β1age + β2age2
 + β4age_group + β4sex + 
β5encounters_per_year 
 We evaluated laboratory tests for laboratory-related phecodes associated with COVID￾19 susceptibility, which included Vitamin D insufficiency, and inpatient admission, which 
included thrombocytopenia. For vitamin D insufficiency, we identified the minimum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D within the past one year of SARS-CoV-2 testing. We reasoned the minimum 
value would more accurately reflect the level of vitamin D insufficiency as higher values may 
result from vitamin D supplementation. We compared the minimum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 
COVID-19 positive (measured in 138 of 843) to the DDR Sample (measured in 487 of 10,000) 
with the following Firth logistic regression model and used the likelihood ratio test: 
logit(outcome)=β0 + β1age + β2age_group + β3age2

For thrombocytopenia, we identified the minimum platelet level within the past one year of 
SARS-CoV-2 testing. We reasoned the minimum value would more accurately reflect when a 
diagnosis of thrombocytopenia would be made. We compared the minimum platelet level in 
COVID-19 inpatients (measured in 105 of 177) to the COVID-19 outpatients (measured in 277 
of 666) with the following Firth logistic regression model and used the likelihood ratio test:

Prior Renal Diagnoses as COVID-19 Risk Factors
We considered the following renal disease categories: chronic renal disease, acute renal 
disease, end stage renal disease, anemia due to chronic renal disease, and renal transplant 
(see Table S7 for phecodes assigned to renal disease categories). We controlled for major 
known risk factors except for chronic renal disease (coronary heart disease, congestive heart 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,

Outcome for Severe was considered Inpatient Severe vs. Inpatient Not Severe; for Inpatient 
was considered COVID-19 positive Inpatient vs COVID-19 positive Outpatient; and for COVID￾19 positive was considered COVID-19 positive vs. the DDR Sample. 
Extremes of COVID-19 severity susceptibility or resistance 
We identified COVID-19 young patients with no major comorbidities admitted as an inpatient 
and COVID-19 older patients with comorbidities not admitted as an inpatient. We defined 
COVID-19 young patients with no major comorbidities admitted as an inpatient as: 
• COVID-19 positive 
• Less than 25 years old 
• At least one prior UCLA Health encounter 
• None of the following comorbidities: history of renal disease, diabetes, congestive heart 
failure, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. These comorbidities were based on phecode 
groupings in Table S1. 
• Inpatient admission within 14 days of a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. 
We defined COVID-19 older patients with major comorbidities not admitted as an inpatient as: 
• COVID-19 positive

• Greater than 70 years old 
• At least one prior UCLA Health encounter 
• At least three of the following comorbidities: history of renal disease, diabetes, 
congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. These comorbidities were 
based on phecode groupings in Table S1. 
• No inpatient admission within 14 days of a SARS-CoV-2 positive test 
Prior Medications Associated with COVID-19 
We investigated the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin 
receptor blockers (ARB), immunosuppressants, oral steroids, oral anticoagulants, and non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see Table S8 for drugs assigned to medication classes) 90 
days prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing. We controlled for age, sex, and known risk factors in the 
following Firth logistic regression model and used the likelihood ratio test: 
logit(outcome)= β0 + β1age + β2age2 β3sex + β4coronary_artery_disease + 
β5congestive_heart_failure + β6chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease + 
β7type_2_diabetes + β8hyperlipidemia + β9hypertension + β10obesity + 
β11chronic_renal_disease + β12medication 
Outcome for Severe was considered Inpatient Severe vs. Inpatient Not Severe; for Inpatient 
was considered COVID-19 positive Inpatient vs COVID-19 positive Outpatient; and for COVID￾19 positive was considered COVID-19 positive vs. COVID-19 negative. We performed the latter 
comparison to preserve the 90-day prior medication usage window.
