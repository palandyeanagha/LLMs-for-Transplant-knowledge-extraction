Abstract
Background: Paediatric hybrid cardiovascular procedures are becoming increasingly popular due to the wide spectrum of 
cardiovascular abnormalities and a large population of patients who could benefit from hybrid therapy. Contemporary hybrid 
procedures are introduced in the settings where routine cardiac surgery or cardiac interventions would not allow satisfactory 
results. Combining cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology techniques appears more beneficial and less invasive for 
the patient. 
Aim: To present results of hybrid procedures performed in the treatment of selected congenital heart disease in our centre 
in 2008–2013. 
Methods: We retrospectively analysed consecutive 80 patients referred for hybrid procedures. 
Results: Overall, 73 patients survived, with 4 early and 3 late deaths. 
Conclusions: Hybrid procedures in children with congenital heart disease combine the experience of cardiac surgery and 
interventional cardiology. Hybrid treatment is an alternative option for selected borderline patients. Initial results of hybrid 
treatment encourage further development of these methods and strategies to provide optimal benefits for the patients.

INTRODUCTION
Complex anatomy and pathophysiology of congenital heart 
disease in children resulted in the development of new treat￾ment strategies based on cooperation of invasive cardiologists 
and cardiac surgeons, supported by sophisticated intra￾operative imaging techniques — hybrid procedures. With this 
approach, positive effects of therapy can be achieved while 
side effects typically observed when individual component 
treatments are used separately can be limited. These proce￾dures are used in the treatment of children with congenital 
heart disease (CHD) with atypical anatomy and associated 
additional limitations, or with borderline difficult anatomical 
variants of typical disease [1]. The aim of this study was to 
present experience of the Department of Paediatric Cardiac 
Surgery in Gdansk, Poland, related to introduction and practi￾cal use of hybrid procedures in the treatment of selected CHD 
in children during more than 5 years since this program was 
initiated in 2008.
METHODS
Study group
We retrospectively analysed 80 consecutive patients referred 
for hybrid procedures performed in the Department of Pae￾diatric Cardiac Surgery in Gdansk from January 1, 2008 to

Hybrid procedures in children

September 10, 2013. The study group included 38 (47.5%) 
boys and 42 (52.5%) girls. Ten patients were neonates younger 
than 28 (12.5%) days. In 1 female patient, 2 hybrid procedures 
were performed. Procedures and demographic characteristics 
of the patients are shown in Table 1.
In addition to CHD, concomitant problems in patients 
referred for hybrid procedures included perinatal morbid￾ity, progressive circulatory decompensation, and congenital 
defects involving other organs and systems. Twenty (25%) 
patients were born prematurely, 32 (40%) had low birth 
weight, 20 (25%) had perinatal infection, 27 (33.8%) showed 
respiratory failure on admission, 65 (81.2%) showed cya￾nosis on admission, 50 (62.5%) were small for gestational 
age, 9 (11.3%) had coarctation of the aorta, 2 (2.5%) had 
left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and 
22 (27.5%) patients had a genetic syndrome. The thymus 
was found to be absent in 15 (18.8%) patients. Surgical/car￾diac surgical procedures or invasive cardiology interventions 
were performed before the hybrid procedure in 49 (61.3%) 
patients. We treated 15 (18.8%) children with a single 
ventricle (SV) physiology, including 6 with hypoplastic left 
heart syndrome (HLHS). Additional problems coexisting 
with CHD in patients treated with hybrid procedures are 
summarised in Table 2.
Hybrid procedures
Details of hybrid procedures of transventricular closure of 
muscular ventricular septal defects (mVSD) (Fig. 1) were 
reported in our previous reports [2–6], and the technique of 
hybrid procedures in neonates with (HLHS hybrid stage I and 
HLHS comprehensive hybrid stage II) was consistent with the 
approach suggested by Galantowicz et al. [7]. All HLHS hybrid 
stage I procedures were performed in the following order: ini￾tially, selective banding of the right pulmonary artery and then

For hybrid closure of ventricular septal defects (VSD), 
we used Amplatzer VSD Occluder (St. Jude Medical, Inc., 
USA) and Amplatzer Duct Occluder II (St. Jude Medical, 
Inc., USA) devices, and ostium secundum atrial septal 
defects (ASD II) were closed using Amplatzer Septal Oc￾cluder (St. Jude Medical, Inc., USA) devices. For dilation 
of the ductus arteriosus, we used coronary stents (Abbott 
Laboratories, USA) and vascular stents (Cook Medical, 
Inc., USA; C.R. Bard, Inc., USA). Balloon angioplasties 
were performed using balloon catheters (Balton Sp. z o.o., 
Poland). For selective pulmonary artery banding, 2.5 mm 
wide stripes of cut-through PTFE vascular conduit (diameter 
3.5 mm) were used (GoreTex®, EU) [8].
the left pulmonary artery was performed under continued 
prostaglandin E1 infusion, followed by stenting of the patent 
ductus arteriosus and termination of prostaglandin E1 infusion. 
The initial access route of choice was conventional median 
sternotomy but with growing experience of the whole team 
this was replaced by a less invasive approach involving limited 
sternotomy within the xiphoid process and lower sternum, 
performed without thymectomy (in 5 children).
Individual stages of the hybrid procedure were imaged 
using fluoroscopy (single-plane General Electric Innova 
4100 system) and transthoracic, transoesophageal and epicar￾dial echocardiography (GE Vivid i, Philips iE 33). An important 
component of the evaluation of immediate procedural results 
was exit angiography performed in all neonates with SV 
physiology (Fig. 2). Routine early anticoagulation with heparin 
was used for up to 48 h after the procedure, and antiplatelet 
treatment with acetylsalicylic acid was continued for up to 
6 months after the procedure.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS v.13.0 for 
Windows statistical software (SPSS Inc., USA). Continuous 
variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. 
Categorical variables were compared using the Pearson c2
 test 
or the exact Fisher test with Yates’s correction in case of small 
sample sizes in subgroups. P < 0.05 was considered statisti￾cally significant. Survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier 
curves. All patients included in the survival analysis died due 
to the underlying cardiac disease and/or its complications 
or were followed-up until September 10, 2013. Survival in 
subgroups was compared using the log-rank test.
RESULTS
During the study period, 1,246 children were treated due 
to CHD in the Department of Paediatric Cardiac Surgery in 
Gdansk. This included 476 surgical procedures with the use 
of extracorporeal circulation (on-pump), 574 surgical proce￾dures without the use of extracorporeal circulation (off-pump), 
and 196 invasive cardiology procedures. Hybrid procedures 
amounted for 6.4% of all procedures. The proportion of hybrid 
procedures in subsequent years was 0% in 2008, 0.7% in 
2009, 6.5% in 2010, 6.9% in 2011, 8.2% in 2012 and 8.5% 
in 2013 (follow-up in progress) (Fig. 3).
Underlying congenital defects in the study group of 
80 children were HLHS in 6 (7.5%) children, left ventricular 
hypoplasia in 3 (3.8%) children, mVSD in 14 (17.5%) children, 
type B interrupted aortic arch (IAA) in 1 (1.3%) child, ASD II 
in 2 (2.5%) children, native pulmonary stenosis in 36 (45%) 
children, and iatrogenic stenosis following pulmonary artery 
banding in 18 (22.5%) children. During the study period, 
the following hybrid procedures were performed: hybrid 
intraoperative dilatation of peripheral pulmonary artery sten￾oses during staged repair of tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) or shunt 
lesions with increased pulmonary flow, performed using the 
transventricular approach or by pulmonary artery puncture, 
in 53 (65.4%) patients, hybrid transventricular mVSD clo￾sure in 14 (17.2%) patients, hybrid transatrial ASD II closure 
in 2 (2.4%) children, HLHS hybrid stage I procedures in 
10 (12.3%) patients, and HLHS comprehensive hybrid stage 
II procedure in 1 (1.2%) child. 
Among children with mVSD and ASD II, the hybrid pro￾cedure resulted in complete shunt occlusion in 15 children, 
and a small shunt through a slit-like mVSD persisted during 
a 2-year follow-up in 1 female patient with multiple VSD. 
No complications related to the presence of an implanted 
device were noted during short- and medium-term follow-up 
(mean duration of follow-up 26.1 ± 15.4 months; range 
3.9–51.3 months). Hybrid balloon angioplasty procedures 
resulted in dilatation of pulmonary artery stenoses, both 
native (mainly involving pulmonary artery branches or the 
pulmonary valve) and iatrogenic (following palliative surgical 
pulmonary artery banding). During follow-up, the highest 
residual gradient in the main pulmonary artery or its branches 
as measured by echocardiography was 25 mm Hg (mean dura￾tion of follow-up 16.9 ± 9.1 months; range 4–34.7 months). 
After hybrid pulmonary artery balloon angioplasty techniques 
were introduced, we were essentially able to abandon surgical 
dilatation of iatrogenic pulmonary artery stenoses following 
pulmonary artery banding.

Staged Norwood procedure remains the standard ap￾proach to the management of HLHS. Patients with HLHS 
referred for hybrid procedures were very severely ill neonates 
who were refused conventional treatment. Despite very high 
procedural risk, the hybrid procedure was the only potential 
treatment option in this patient group. In 1 child after HLHS 
hybrid stage I procedure, a stenosis of the ductus arteriosus 
located proximally to the implanted stent was observed that 
required another intervention [9]. 
When we analysed characteristics of and concomi￾tant conditions in children with SV physiology, we found 
that the mean age of children with SV physiology was 
3.2 ± 3.6 months (range 1 day to 7.9 months) compared to 
12.4 ± 15.9 months in children with double ventricle (DV) 
physiology (range 1.9–107.5 months), a statistically significant 
difference (p = 0.001). The mean body mass in these patient 
groups also differed significantly, 4.6 ± 2.1 kg in the SV group 
(range 2–8.3 kg) compared to 7.1 ± 3.4 kg in the DV group 
(range 1.8–23.3 kg) (p = 0.003). Children with SV physio￾logy who underwent a hybrid procedure were referred for 
this treatment at an earlier stage and with lower body mass, 
and thus potentially significantly higher operative risk, and 
were more often found to have respiratory failure, cyanosis, 
perinatal infection or concomitant CDH (Table 3).
Survival analysis
As of September 10, 2013, 73 patients remained in follow-up, 
and the mean duration of follow-up was 17.6 ± 12.1 months 
(range 0 days to 51.3 months). Among children with SV 
physiology, 7 patients died, yielding 1-year and 2-year survival 
probability of 65.5% and 54.5%, respectively (mean duration 
of follow-up 14.6 months) (Fig. 4), and no deaths were noted 
among the remaining children treated with hybrid procedures 
(survival 100%, mean duration of follow-up 18.8 months; 
p < 0.001). Thus, overall 73 of 80 patients are alive, with 
4 early deaths (within 30 days after the procedure, including 
1 child with left ventricular hypoplasia associated with CDH 
and 3 children with HLHS) and 3 late deaths (1 child with 
IAA, 1 child with left ventricular hypoplasia associated with 
CDH, and 1 child with HLHS).
DISCUSSION
Hybrid cardiovascular procedures in children are becom￾ing increasingly popular, with a growing range of defects 
undergoing such treatment and an increasing population of 
patients who could benefit from hybrid therapy. Contempo￾rary hybrid procedures are introduced in the settings where 
routine cardiac surgery or cardiac interventions would not 
allow satisfactory results, and combining cardiac surgery and 
interventional cardiology techniques is actually less invasive 
and traumatizing for the patient.

Due to a need to introduce hybrid procedures in the 
Department of Paediatric Cardiac Surgery in Gdansk, the 
”Gdansk Hybrid Heartlink” program was initiated in 2008 to 
provide a full spectrum of hybrid treatment capabilities for 
children with CHD [10]. The whole team of our Department 
of Paediatric Cardiac Surgery was created with an idea to fully 
explore the potential of cardiac surgeons, invasive cardiolo￾gists, cardioanaesthesiologists, neonatal and infant surgeons, 
and neonatologists in cooperation with obstetrics and gynae￾cology and paediatric cardiology tertiary care centres. 
Hybrid procedures in the Department of Paediatric Cardiac 
Surgery in Gdansk were initially introduced in the treatment of 
infants with mVSD, followed by neonates and preterm infants 
with IAA, and finally selected neonates with HLHS and left ven￾tricular hypoplasia associated with CDH. Hybrid intraoperative 
pulmonary artery balloon angioplasty was successfully used as 
adjunct procedure during staged repair of ToF and shunt lesions 
with increased pulmonary flow following earlier pulmonary 
artery banding. After hybrid balloon angioplasty techniques 
were introduced into our routine practice, we were essentially 
able to abandon surgical dilatation of pulmonary artery stenoses 
following pulmonary artery banding.
With development of the program and growing ex￾perience of the whole team, we began to perform hybrid 
procedures in ”borderline” patients, including neonates and 
premature infants with multiple comorbidities and extremely 
low body mass, which is consistent with treatment strategies 
used in other centres with similar programs [11–13]. In addi￾tion, we introduced surgical techniques allowing less invasive 
access, including miniinvasive sternotomy, which reduced 
operative trauma and its potential sequelae. In children 
undergoing hybrid treatment, sparing thymus during the first 
procedure also seems beneficial, as it allows maintaining 
function of this gland in early infancy and facilitates surgical 
access to the heart and great vessel during further stages of 
treatment and reoperations.
All patients who died early after a hybrid procedure were 
neonates in the “borderline” group. Their extremely severely ill 
general condition and comorbidities precluded both conventional 
cardiac surgery and conventional interventional treatment (in our 
material, these were “borderline” neonates and preterm infants 
with HLHS and CDH). Overall mortality after hybrid procedures 
(8.8%), despite multiple comorbidities present in “borderline” 
patients, is generally consistent with the acceptable operative 
mortality in cardiac surgery programs in Poland and worldwide.
Hybrid procedures still constitute a minor proportion of 
all procedures performed in the Department of Paediatric 
Cardiac Surgery in Gdansk but their number is increasing with 
growing experience of our team. Thus, their value results from 
the fact that they became an additional, alternative treatment 
option for selected patients. 
CONCLUSIONS
Hybrid procedures in children with CHD combine the ex￾perience of cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology 
and are an alternative treatment option for selected patients, 
including severely ill ”borderline” patients. Initial results of 
hybrid treatment encourage further development of these 
methods and strategies to provide optimal benefits for the 
patients. Performance of hybrid procedures in patients with 
additional problems requires close multidisciplinary coopera￾tion within the Hybrid Heart Team, involving cardiac surgeons, 
invasive cardiologists, and anaesthesiologists.

Streszczenie
Wstęp: Mimo ciągłego postępu w zakresie technik diagnostycznych i terapeutycznych w ostatnich latach brakuje istotnego 
postępu w leczeniu wrodzonych wad serca. Czynione są intensywne wysiłki w kierunku doskonalenia kardiochirurgicznych 
technik operacyjnych oraz interwencji kardiologicznych, a także łączenia ich w celu uzyskania lepszego wyniku terapii. Zabiegi 
hybrydowe w leczeniu wrodzonych wad serca u dzieci zyskują coraz większą popularność, rozszerza się zakres wad serca 
leczonych w ten sposób oraz populacja pacjentów mogących być beneficjentami terapii hybrydowej. Współcześnie proce￾dury hybrydowe stosuje się w sytuacjach, gdy rutynowe zabiegi kardiochirurgiczne lub przezskórne zabiegi interwencyjne 
nie przyniosłyby zadowalającego efektu terapeutycznego. 
Cel: Celem pracy było przedstawienie własnych doświadczeń ośrodka we wdrażaniu i praktycznym zastosowaniu procedur 
hybrydowych w leczeniu wybranych wrodzonych wad serca u dzieci w latach 2008–2013.
Metody: Retrospektywnej analizie poddano własny materiał stanowiący grupę 80 pacjentów kwalifikowanych do procedur 
hybrydowych, wykonanych na Oddziale Kardiochirurgii Dziecięcej PCT w Gdańsku. 
Wyniki: Wśród prezentowanej grupy 80 pacjentów żyje 73 dzieci; zanotowano 4 zgony wczesne i 3 późne.
Wnioski: Zabiegi hybrydowe u dzieci z wrodzonymi wadami serca łączą doświadczenia kardiochirurgii oraz kardiologii inter￾wencyjnej i stanowią dodatkową opcję terapii dla wybranej grupy pacjentów. Wstępne wyniki leczenia hybrydowego są zachętą 
do dalszego rozwoju opisywanych metod i wypracowywania strategii w celu osiągnięcia optymalnej korzyści dla pacjenta.
