link in the evolution of airway fibrosis?

Angiogenesis may be an important factor in the development of fibrotic 
lung disease. Prior studies have strongly suggested a role for angiogenic 
vascular remodeling in pulmonary fibrosis, and emerging evidence indi￾cates that new vessel formation is critical in airway fibrosis. Bronchiol￾itis obliterans syndrome is a fibrotic occlusion of distal airways that is 
largely responsible for the morbidity and mortality of patients after lung 
transplantation. In this issue, Belperio et al. demonstrate a role for CXC 
chemokine receptor 2 in the regulation of angiogenesis-mediated airway 
fibroproliferation (see the related article beginning on page 1150). By 
integrating an understanding of neovascularization into the study of 
events that occur between inflammation and fibrosis, it becomes increas￾ingly possible to rationally design therapies that can halt conditions of 
maladaptive fibrosis.
Neovascularization is an important compo￾nent of fibrotic responses (1). In this issue 
of the JCI, Belperio and colleagues extend 
this relationship to the development of 
chronic lung transplant rejection (2). 
Using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 
patients with pending or established bron￾chiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and 
tracheal allograft tissue from a mouse 
model of obliterative airway disease, the 
authors make a convincing case for the 
central role of CXC chemokine receptor 2 
(CXCR2) regulation of angiogenesis-medi￾ated airway fibroproliferation.
Airway inflammation and fibrosis 
in the evolution of BOS
Chronic allograft rejection is the chief factor 
limiting long-term survival following lung 
transplantation. BOS is the pathological 
correlate of chronic rejection and primarily 
affects the respiratory and terminal bronchi￾oles, which culminates in a fibrotic occlusion 
of the distal airways (3). The cumulative inci￾dence of BOS at 5 years after lung transplant 
is between 50% and 80%, and 5-year survival 
after BOS onset is only 30–50%. The Interna￾tional Society of Heart and Lung Transplanta￾tion Registry has noted that the development 
of BOS within the first year after transplan￾tation is the single most important factor 
influencing 5-year mortality among patients 
undergoing lung transplantation (3). As a 
fibrotic disease, BOS is poorly responsive to 
standard immunosuppression employed by 
transplant physicians. Similarly, pulmonary 
fibrosis, which affects the lung interstitium 
rather than the conducting airways, responds 
poorly to immunotherapy and has long been 
associated with pathologic angiogenesis (4).
It is a generally recognized phenomenon 
that inflammation is an initiating event 
that precedes the progression to fibrosis in 
several lung diseases, including BOS and 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. While fibro￾sis may be a frequent sequel of an acute or 
subacute inflammatory event, it is also clear 
that inflammation does not always result in 
fibrosis. The long-term effect of interstitial 
or airway fibrosis is irreversible lung archi￾tectural remodeling. Key questions regard￾ing the mechanisms of airway remodeling 
are: (a) What are the specific inflammatory 
initiators? and (b) What is the sequence of 
events that culminates in fibroprolifera￾tion? In lung transplantation, the answer to 
the first question most certainly involves the 
response to alloantigen triggering of innate 
and adaptive immune responses. The answer 
to the second question is probably less well 
understood but is perhaps of greater impor￾tance in the development of therapies that 
reach beyond immunosuppression. Lung 
transplant clinicians well appreciate that 
acute rejection treated early may respond 
excellently to immunosuppressive therapies 
but that late intervention is rarely success￾ful. Unfortunately, it is not always possible 
to intervene early, and occasionally even 
apparently early intervention with high￾dose steroids or T cell–depleting strategies 
cannot halt the decline in lung function 
once fibroproliferation is initiated.
The potential role 
of CXC chemokines in 
angiofibroproliferative BOS
The study by Belperio and colleagues (2) 
firmly establishes that neovascularization 
is an important contributor to the process 
of fibroproliferation in airway fibrosis. 
The investigators present a cohesive and 
clearly argued interpretation of experi￾mental data from human BOS patients 
and a well-characterized murine model of 
tracheal transplant rejection. Their find￾ings make a convincing case for the cen￾tral role of CXCR2-dependent Glu-Leu￾Arg–positive (ELR+) chemokine regulation 
of angiogenesis-mediated BOS fibropro￾liferation. The study extends their previ￾Nonstandard abbreviations used: BOS, bronchiolitis 
obliterans syndrome; CXCL, CXC chemokine ligand;

ously published observations based on the 
BOS model, which implicated monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1/CXCR2–medi￾ated mononuclear phagocytic infiltra￾tion in the progression of BOS (5). CXC 
chemokines, 1 of the 4 subfamilies of mul￾tifunctional growth- and immune-mediat￾ing molecules, regulate acute inflammatory 
responses and vascular remodeling. CXC 
chemokines contain an ELR+ motif imme￾diately before the first cysteine residue at 
the NH2 terminus. This group includes 
CXC ligand 1 (CXCL1), -2, -3, -5, -6, and -8. 
Angiogenesis (both physiological and path￾ological) is potently stimulated by engage￾ment of these ligands with G protein–
coupled CXCR2 on endothelial cells. By 
contrast, IFN-regulated ELR– chemokines 
such as CXCL4, -9, -10, and -11 function as 
angiostatic regulators through CXCR3 and 
direct interaction with angiogenic factors 
such as VEGF (6).
The elucidation of VEGF-independent, 
chemokine-mediated angiogenesis is piv￾otal to our evolving understanding of the 
cascade of remodeling events that results in 
inexorable progression of fibroproliferative 
BOS. The present study also demonstrates a 
temporal separation of signaling responses 
to CXCR2 activation. CXCR2 engagement 
in early murine tracheal allograft BOS 
results in neutrophil trafficking, but at 3 
weeks results in neutrophil-independent 
angiofibroproliferation (2). Moreover, 
treatment of CXCR2–/– mice with threshold 
doses of cyclosporin, insufficient to prevent 
BOS in wild-type mice but sufficient to 
inhibit early monocyte infiltration, resulted 
in a dramatic reduction in allograft fibro￾obliteration, which points to a clinically rel￾evant strategy for further investigation.
How does pathological angiogenesis fit 
into what is already known or generally 
posited for lung fibrosis? Briefly, there is evi￾dence to suggest that the epithelium can be 
an early target as well as a source of alloanti￾gen (7). Following exposure to a new antigen 
or toxin, there is an influx of neutrophils and 
mononuclear cells (Figure 1A). This period 
of cellular infiltration is associated with an 
increased production of chemokines and 
cytokines. In this cascade, multiple changes 
occur in the epithelia, including apoptosis, 
hyperplasia, dedifferentiation, and metapla￾sia (8–12). Epithelial changes may stimulate 
underlying myofibroblasts in a paracrine 
fashion, with resultant collagen matrix depo￾sition (13–15). In the midst of these changes, 
neovascularization is observed (Figure 1B). 
Perhaps as a consequence of increased vascu￾larity and chemoattractant gradients, migra￾tory cell populations (e.g., fibrocytes; ref. 16) 
traffic to the site of inflammation, possibly 
as part of a tissue repair response. As this 
process progresses, the cellular infiltrates 
diminish (8, 9), and airway remodeling pro￾ceeds in a unidirectional fashion, with exten￾sive subepithelial, luminal, and/or interstitial 
fibrosis. Our group has recently established 
using an orthotopic (in situ) mouse tracheal 
transplant model that it is possible to reverse 
alloimmune injury that remains unmitigat￾ed for 7 days, but after 10 days of unprotect￾ed immune airway injury, fibroproliferative 
diseases cannot be ameliorated (8). Thus, it 
appears that a temporal sequence of events 
leading from inflammation to fibrosis may 
be closer to being fully elucidated.
In addition to alloimmune injury, sev￾eral important potential amplifiers of BOS 
have been identified. These include chronic 
gastroesophageal reflux (17), community￾acquired viral infection (18), and CMV 
infection (19), all of which are also associat￾ed with chronic graft rejection. Chemokine￾mediated inflammation and angiogenesis 
may be a common pathway for progres￾sion to fibroproliferative BOS in response 
to superimposition of these factors on an 
immune-injured airway. For example, viru￾lent CMV strains produce a potent ELR+
chemokine analog, UL146 (also known 
as viral CXCL1). This CXCR2-restricted 
ligand is capable of inducing neutrophil 
chemotaxis independent of monocyte 
activation (20) and could potentially con￾tribute to chemokine-mediated perigraft 
angiogenesis and fibroproliferation.
Belperio and colleagues’ important 
observations (2) hold great promise for 
translational application in the therapy of 
BOS and other fibrotic lung diseases that 
involve pathological angiofibroprolifera￾tion. Presently, prevention of graft rejection 
requires intensive, prolonged immunosup￾pression with corticosteroids, calcineurin 
antagonists, antimetabolites, and immune 
modulators (21). This approach, which is 
focused on the inflammatory component, 
has clear limitations, with significantly 
increased risks of opportunistic infec￾tion and a limited effect on angiogenesis. 
An obvious therapeutic strategy would be 
treatment with a combination of lower 
doses of traditional immunosuppres￾sants and humanized blocking antibodies 
against angiogenic chemokines or their 
receptors, as modeled in the present study 
(2). If this broad framework holds true for 
most fibrotic conditions, in the future, it 
may be possible to more appropriately treat 
other pulmonary, renal, dermatological, 
and cardiac diseases in which the inflam￾mation-angiogenesis-fibroproliferative 
pathways are active.

Evolution of BOS from airway injury to angiofibroproliferation. (A) The progression of airway pathology from initial injury to luminal and 
subepithelial fibrosis begins with cellular infiltration consisting of macrophages (a significant source of CXCL2), neutrophils, and subsequently 
T lymphocytes. Infiltrating cells and injured lung parenchyma (e.g., epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells) liberate a variety of cytokines, 
oxidants, and chemokines. One prominently expressed chemokine, CXCL2, binds to receptors on neutrophils and vascular endothelium, 
simultaneously promoting a neutrophil influx and angiogenesis. Following cellular infiltration, the respiratory epithelium is likely injured, and 
pseudostratified columnar epithelium undergoes apoptosis and is transformed into a flattened, dysplastic monolayer that covers the basement 
membrane. (B) During a period when the epithelium is undergoing progressive injury, angiogenesis likely occurs through a CXCR2-dependent, 
VEGF-independent process (2). While the mechanism by which angiogenesis contributes to progressive airway fibrosis has not yet been fully 
elucidated, it is possible that increased vascularity facilitates the delivery of growth factors that promote tissue remodeling (e.g., platelet-derived 
growth factor-2 [PDGF2]) or cells that differentiate to produce collagen (e.g., fibrocytes). The concurrent and persistent immune epithelial injury 
may result in epithelial-myofibroblast crosstalk that promotes new collagen synthesis (22) through paracrine growth factor signaling and epi￾thelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). As subepithelial fibrosis increases and the respiratory epithelium becomes less distinct, increased 
deposition in the airway lumen of type I and III collagen occurs. Eventually, this fibrosis culminates as BOS, a physiologically significant occlu￾sion of the airways in lung transplant recipients, which is the hallmark of chronic lung transplant rejection. PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophil;

Introduction
Until late 1987, it was believed that insulin’s 
ability to reduce hepatic glucose produc￾tion (HGP) resulted from the direct inter￾action of the hormone with its receptor 
in the hepatocyte plasma membrane. This 
belief was called into question when Prager 
et al. (1) noted that in obese, nondiabetic 
humans, suppression of glucose produc￾tion could occur in response to insulin

The role of hepatic insulin receptors in the 
regulation of glucose production
Alan D. Cherrington
Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.
The inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production (HGP) 
is a key defect found in type 2 diabetes. Insulin inhibits HGP through 
both direct and indirect means, the latter of which include inhibition of 
glucagon secretion, reduction in plasma nonesterified fatty acid level, 
decrease in the load of gluconeogenic substrates reaching the liver, and 
change in neural signaling to the liver. Two studies in this issue of the JCI
demonstrate that selective changes in the expression of insulin receptors 
in mouse liver do not have a detectable effect on the ability of insulin to 
inhibit HGP (see the related articles beginning on pages 1306 and 1314). 
These provocative data suggest that the indirect effects of insulin on the 
liver are the primary determinant of HGP in mice.

glucose output.

infusion, even when the estimated portal 
vein insulin concentration did not rise. 
These results suggested that insulin also 
reduces hepatic glucose output by indirect 
mechanisms. Subsequent work by others 
supported this concept (2–5), and it is now 
recognized that insulin can inhibit HGP by 
both direct and indirect means (Figure 1).
Indirect actions of insulin on the liver
The indirect actions of insulin on HGP are 
diverse. Glucagon secretion from the α cell of 
the pancreas is diminished by insulin, which 
in turn causes a reduction in HGP (6). Like￾wise, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) release 
from the adipocyte is reduced by insulin, and 
a reduction in the supply of NEFAs to the 
liver causes an increase in hepatic glycolytic 
flux, resulting in glucose-6-phosphate exit￾ing the liver after being converted to lactate 
rather than glucose (3). Additionally, the 
effect of insulin on fat and muscle reduces 
the supply of gluconeogenic precursors 
reaching the liver, again reducing HGP (2, 7). 
More recently, insulin’s action in the brain 
has been postulated to play a role in the regu￾lation of HGP (8). It is known that the brain 
can sense the circulating insulin level (9) and 
that it provides neural input to the liver (10). 
Further, it has been shown that infusion of 
insulin into the third ventricle of rats can 
reduce glucose production (8). Likewise, 
blocking insulin action in the rat hypothala￾mus impairs the ability of a physiologic rise 
in circulating insulin to inhibit HGP (8).
Direct actions of insulin on the liver
The exploration of insulin’s indirect effects 
on the liver called into question the physi￾ologic relevance of the hormone’s direct 
hepatic effect, even though numerous in 
vitro studies had shown it to exist. Perhaps 
the best in vivo demonstration of the hor￾mone’s direct effect on the liver comes from 
studies conducted in the conscious over￾night-fasted dog, in which changes in plasma 
insulin were brought about selectively in the 
liver using the pancreatic clamp technique.
