Abstract
Background: Locoregional interventional bridging therapy (IBT) is an accepted neoadjuvant approach in liver transplant
candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the prognostic value of IBT in patients with advanced HCC is still
undefined.
Aim: The aim of this trial was to evaluate the impact of postinterventional tumor necrosis on recurrence-free long-term
survival after liver transplantation (LT) in patients with HCC, especially focusing on those exceeding the Milan criteria on
pretransplant radiographic imaging.
Patients and Methods: A total of 93 consecutive liver transplant candidates with HCC were included in this trial. In 36
patients, tumors were clinically staged beyond Milan criteria prior LT. Fifty-nine patients underwent IBT by transarterial
chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation pretransplantation. Postinterventional tumor necrosis rate as assessed at
liver explant pathology was correlated with outcome post-LT.
Results: There was no significant difference in 5-year tumor-free survival rate between the IBT- and the non-IBT
subpopulation (78% versus 68%, P = 0.25). However, tumor response following IBT ($50% tumor necrosis rate at explant
pathology) resulted in a significantly better outcome 5 years post-LT (96%) than tumor non-response to IBT (,50% tumor
necrosis rate at explant pathology; 21%; P,0.001). Five-year recurrence-free survival rate was 80% in Milan Out patients with
extended post-IBT tumor necrosis versus 0% in Milan Out patients without tumor response to IBT (P,0.001). None of
macromorphological HCC features, but only the absence of increased 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (18FDG) uptake on
pretransplant positron emission tomography (PET) was identified as independent predictor of postinterventional tumor
response (P,0.001).
Conclusion: Our results implicate that extended postinterventional tumor necrosis promotes recurrence-free long-term
survival in patients with HCC beyond standard criteria. Pretransplant PET assessment may identify those patients with
advanced HCC that will benefit from post-IBT tumor response and may, thereby, achieve excellent posttransplant outcome.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary
tumor of the liver and its incidence is expected to rise
continuously. Cirrhosis is present in approximately 90% of the
cases and frequently limits curative liver resection. Liver trans￾plantation (LT) has the advantage to remove the tumor and the
underlying cirrhosis. Furthermore, it is able to restore normal
hepatic function [1]. However, early results were discouraging
with high tumor recurrence rates and dismal patient survival
because of advanced tumor stage [1,2]. The implementation of the
Milan criteria (one tumor nodule up to 5 cm, maximum of 3
tumor nodules each up to 3 cm, no macroscopic vascular invasion
or extrahepatic disease) in 1996 by Mazzafero et al. has established
LT as standard therapy in patients with early stage HCC in liver
cirrhosis [3]. Patients with tumors selected according these
standard criteria may achieve a 5-year recurrence-free survival
rate about 70%, which is an extraordinary outcome data in
oncological surgery [4,5]. They have been adopted by the United
Network for Organ Sharing and by the Eurotransplant Founda￾tion as standard criteria for listing patients with HCC. In both
transplant organizations, liver allocation is currently based on the
Model for End Stage Liver Disease [MELD), assigning exceptional

priority points for patients with tumors that are meeting the Milan
criteria, so that timely LT can be performed [6]. In recent years,
however, several groups have argued that the Milan criteria might
be too restrictive, and exclude a high number of patients from
potentially curative LT [4,7,8,9,10]. In 2001, colleagues from the
University of California San Francisco have defined the UCSF
criteria (one single tumor up to 6.5 cm, or up to 3 tumors with the
largest being 4.5 cm in diameter, with a total tumor diameter
,8 cm) as reasonable new macromorphological tumor burden,
implementing locoregional interventional bridging treatments
(IBT) prior LT [8]. Subsequently, the UCSF criteria have been
adopted in several transplant centers as standard for indicating
LT.
In recent years, IBT by transarterial chemoembolization
(TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or percutaneous ethanol
injection has gained wide acceptance around the world [9–12].
Apart from tumor downstaging into accepted criteria [13,14,15],
bridging to LT in order to reduce the risk of tumor-related patient
drop-out and posttransplant tumor recurrence is another clinical
approach [12,13,16,17]. Significant reduction of vital tumor load
should, therefore, be the crucial outcome variable of this
procedures [17]. Nevertheless, data about the prognostic value
of postinterventional tumor necrosis in the transplantation setting
are still very limited.
In view of these considerations, the purpose of our study was to
analyze the impact of IBT-induced tumor necrosis on posttrans￾plant long-term outcome in liver transplant patients with HCC,
especially focusing on those tumors exceeding the Milan criteria
on pretransplant clinical staging.
Patients and Methods
Patient characteristics
Between 1996 and 2008, 114 patients with HCC in liver
cirrhosis were listed for LT (Table 1). Nine patients presenting
incidental small HCC assessed only at pathological specimen were
not included in the analysis.
Diagnosis of HCC was established by clinical staging, including
ultrasonography, dynamic computed tomography (CT), contrast￾enhanced magnetic resonance tomography (MRI), and alpha￾fetoprotein (AFP) measurements. Furthermore, whole-body 18F￾fluoro-deoxy-glucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography
(PET) was performed for clinical staging minimum once pre-LT
and before initiating IBT in all patients. According to the glucose
metabolism on 18F-FDG PET, tumors were classified as PET 2
(no increased FDG uptake as compared to the surrounding liver
tissue) or PET + (increased FDG uptake as compared to the
surrounding liver tissue; Fig. 1), as previously described [18,19].
We did not routinely perform preoperative tumor biopsy.
Patient listing and drop out criteria
Patient listing was based on the Milan criteria since 1996 [3].
After the introduction of the MELD system in the Eurotransplant
region in December 2006, patients with HCC fulfilling the Milan
criteria on clinical staging have received exceptional MELD
priority points [6]. Macromorphological tumor progression
beyond the Milan or UCSF burden did not automatically result
in patient drop out from the waiting list at our center. However,
those patients have lost their exceptional MELD priority points
and were considered for LT with marginal allografts or living
donor liver transplants. Macroscopic tumor invasion into a major
vascular branch, lymph node metastases, extrahepatic tumor
spread and severe tumor-related symptoms disqualified for LT
[20]. Based on final pretransplant radiographic staging of viable
tumor areas, patients were classified according the Milan and
UCSF criteria (Milan In versus Milan Out; UCSF In versus UCSF
Out) [3,5,8,9].
Locoregional interventional bridging therapy pre-LT
Neoadjuvant IBT pretransplantation was implemented at our
center in 1999. All liver transplant candidates were discussed at a
multidisciplinary liver conference, where treatment plans were
established. Based on clinical condition, liver function and tumor
topography/morphology, TACE was the preferred interventional

procedure. It was performed in a standardized manner [21].
Briefly, an aortography was carried out by catheterization of the
femoral artery to illustrate the coeliac trunk and the mesenteric
arteries. Subsequently, the tumor feeding arteries were selected
and catheterized as selectively as possible. A mixture of epirubicin
and lipiodol (20 ml) was infused under real time fluoroscopic
control. The following day, liver function tests were analyzed and
the arterial supply of the liver was controlled by duplexsono￾graphy. Follow-up contrast CT scans were performed within 6
weeks post-intervention for tumor re-staging. Depending on liver
function and radiographic imaging, a maximum of 6 TACE
procedures have been planned.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the tumor was critically
discussed, if patients appeared to be ineligible for TACE, either
for liver dysfunction and/or for morphology/topography of the
tumor. RFA was performed percutaneously and CT-guided
under general anaesthesia [22,23]. A maximum of 3 RFA
procedures were indicated using monopolar perfused electrodes
(HITTH, Berchtold Integra, Tu¨bingen, Germany). Clinical
response of IBT was monitored by MRI evaluation of the liver
within 6 weeks.
Explant histopathology and postinterventional tumor
necrosis
At definitive pathological examinations of the explant liver, HCC
was confirmed in all cases. Tumors were examined according to
size, number, total tumor diameter, stage, lymphatic and vascular
invasion, respectively. Tumor differentiation was determined
according to Edmondson and Steiner’s grading system. Histopath￾ologic tumor staging was assigned by co-operation of the surgery
and pathology staff based on clinical and pathologic data according
to the 5th edition of the Tumor, Node, Metastasis/International
Union Against Cancer criteria of 1997.
The postinterventional tumor necrosis rate was defined as the
proportion of the necrotic region to the total presumed tumor
area. It was categorized as ‘‘complete’’ (no viable tumor), greater
than 75%, between 50% and 75%, or less than 50%. ‘‘Tumor
response’’ to IBT was postulated if a minimum tumor necrosis rate
of 50% was assessed, while tumor necrosis rate ,50% indicated
‘‘tumor non-response’’ to IBT (Fig. 2).
Immunosuppressive therapy and posttransplant tumor
surveillance
Immunosuppression consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor based
regimen (cyclosporine A [CsA] versus tacrolimus [Tac]), either
augmented with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and
prednisone. Corticosteroids were completely tapered in all patients
within 6 months with exception of those with autoimmune
hepatitis. Ultrasonography of the liver allograft and AFP level
measurement were performed every three months post-LT. In
addition, patients underwent CT/MRI evaluation every 6 months
in the first posttransplant year and minimum yearly thereafter, or
in the case of an increasing AFP level.
Assessment of prognostic variables
All data were collected in a prospective database and
retrospectively analyzed. Formal approval of the local ethics
committee was not required due to the studies’ retrospective
character and the fact that all applied procedures (TACE, RFA,
liver transplantation) have already been established therapeutical
interventions (consultation of the local ethical institution). Before a
liver transplant candidate has been put on the waiting list, he
underwent concise medical information about the upcoming
interventional treatments and LT. Furthermore, by a written
consent all liver transplant patients have accepted that data of their
clinical follow-up will be used for academic studies.
The impact of the following variables on recurrence-free long￾term survival was analyzed:
Pretransplant (clinical) variables:
Donor and recipient age, sex, Child status, AFP-level, size and
number of tumor nodules (radiographic imaging), Milan and
UCSF criteria (radiographic imaging), 18F-FDG tumor uptake on
PET
Posttransplant variables:
Microvascular and lymphatic invasion, tumor differentiation,
tumor response to IBT (explant pathology), immunosuppressive
therapy (CsA versus Tac).
Statistical analysis
The software SPSS 17.0 for Windows was used for statistical
analyses. Clinical and histopathologic variables were correlated
with frequencies of tumor recurrence using x2 test and logistic
regression. Overall and recurrence-free survival rates were
determined according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Patient
survival in different groups was compared using the log-rank

test. The value of clinical variables for predicting postinterven￾tional tumor response was assessed by x2 test and logistic
regression.
Variables with a significant prognostic impact on univariate
analysis (P,0.05) were entered into a stepwise multivariate
analysis (Cox multiple stepwise regression model). Only clinical
but not histopathologic variables defining the Milan and UCSF
criteria were included in the analysis.
Results
Patient and tumor characteristics
Twenty-one patients dropped from the waiting list, 14 of them
as a result of tumor progression. Finally, 93 patients underwent LT
(Table 2).
There were 61 male and 32 female liver recipients. Mean
patient age at LT was 58.2 years (range: 38–71 years). Eighty
patients have received a full size liver allograft, while 13 patients
underwent living donor liver transplantation. At final pretrans￾plant radiographic staging, 36 patients demonstrated HCC
beyond the Milan criteria and 28 patients revealed tumors
exceeding the UCSF criteria, respectively (Table 2).
Fifty-nine patients underwent pretransplant IBT (63.4%). Fifty￾one of them were treated by TACE (between 1 and 5 TACE
procedures), while 8 patients underwent RFA therapy, respective￾ly. Mean number of tumor nodules on pretransplant clinical
staging and number of patients under Tac-based immunosup￾pression were significantly higher in the IBT-subpopulation
(Table 2).
Tumor response to IBT at explant pathology
Tumor response to IBT ($50% tumor necrosis rate) was
confirmed in 44 patients (complete tumor necrosis n = 1; tumor
necrosis rate .75%: n = 18; tumor necrosis rate 50%–75%:
n = 25). In contrast, 15 liver recipients were classified as tumor
non-responders to IBT (25.4%).
HCC recurrence and survival rates
Current overall survival is ranging between 5 and 162 months
posttransplantation (mean: 64.3644.2 months).
Five-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates of the entire
study population (n = 93) were 76% and 74%, respectively.
There was no significant difference in 5-year tumor-free survival
between the IBT (78%) and the non-IBT (68%) recipients
(P = 0.25; Fig. 3).
Twenty-one patients developed tumor recurrence (22.6%), 11
patients in the IBT-group (18.6%) and 10 patients in the non-IBT￾population (29.4%, P = 0.23). Tumor recurrence rates tended to
be lower by IBT in both, patients with HCC meeting and
exceeding the Milan and UCSF criteria, respectively (Table 3).
Finally, 44 patients turned out to be tumor responders to IBT,
while postinterventional tumor necrosis rate was below 50% in 15
liver recipients. Only one of 44 responders (2.3%) but 10 of 15

non-responders (66.7%) suffered from posttransplant tumor
recurrence (P,0.001).
Post-IBT tumor responders to IBT had a significantly better
recurrence-free survival rate after 5 years than non-responders to
IBT (96% versus 21%; Fig. 4).
Patients with Milan Out tumors on clinical staging but
demonstrating postinterventional tumor response had a 5-year
recurrence-free survival rate of 80%. This was comparable to
the Milan In group of our trial (86.6%), but significantly better
than in Milan Out patients without tumor response to IBT
(0%; Fig. 5).
Five-year recurrence-free survival rates were 100% and 38.1%
in Milan In patients, and 80% and 0% in Milan Out recipients
with and without postinterventional tumor response, respectively
(Fig. 6).
Five-year tumor-free survival rates were 75% and 0% in UCSF
Out patients with and without post-IBT tumor response,
respectively (P,0.001; Fig. 7).
AFP level, number and total diameter of tumor nodules, Milan
criteria, UCSF criteria, PET status, microvascular invasion, tumor
differentiation, lymphatic and vascular invasion, and tumor
response to IBT correlated significantly with outcome in the
IBT subpopulation (Table 4). However, only tumor response to
IBT was identified as independent predictor of freedom from
tumor recurrence (Table 5).

response to IBT in univariate analysis (Table 6). On multivariate
assessment, only PET negativity of HCC was identified as
independent clinical predictor of post-IBT tumor response
(Table 7).
Discussion
In the present study, our main goal was not to analyze the
potential of IBT as downstaging modality prior LT but to assess its
value for decreasing posttransplant risk of tumor recurrence,
especially focusing on patients with advanced HCC on clinical
staging. We were able to demonstrate that extended post￾interventional tumor necrosis is an independent predictor of
tumor-free long-term survival in liver transplant patients with
HCC. Furthermore, our data point out that tumor response to
IBT is a valuable indicator of favourable tumor biology and may
predict excellent posttransplant outcome in patients with advanced
HCC on pretransplant clinical staging.
Since the implementation of the Milan criteria in 1996, several
transplant centers have advocated for LT as treatment in HCC
beyond standard criteria [3–5]. New interventional options of
pretransplant tumor treatment seem to support the idea of
expanding transplant criteria. Yao et al. reported about recur￾rence-free survival benefits by neoadjuvant IBT after LT in the
subgroup of pT2 and pT3 HCC [9]. Ravaioli et al. demonstrated
that transplant criteria may be slightly extended without survival
disadvantage after implementation of pretransplant IBT [15]. And
recently, Chapman et al. showed that selected patients with stage
III/IV HCC can be successfully downstaged and may, thereby,
achieve excellent survival rates after LT [14]. In contrast, several
other trials were not able to confirm these results [23–26].
Although liver-directed therapy is currently an accepted approach
in the treatment of HCC, conclusive evidence of its efficacy in the
transplant setting is still lacking [8–17,24–26]. This may be related
to differences in study design, listing criteria, pretransplant waiting
times, and posttransplant surveillance concepts. Furthermore, the
intended strategies of IBT were not consistent in recent trials. In
Figure 7. Five-year recurrence-free survival rate was 75% in
UCSF Out patients exhibiting tumor response to IBT and 85.6%
in UCSF In recipients of our trial, but 0% in UCSF Out patients
without postinterventional tumor response, respectively
(P,0.001).

some transplant centers IBT was implemented for tumor down￾staging into accepted criteria before allowing LT [8,14,15,25,26].
Like others, we were not primarily using IBT for tumor
downsizing but particularly for pretransplant tumor control in
order to prevent patient drop-out and to decrease the risk of
posttransplant tumor recurrence [11,16,25].
Apart from that, tumor-related drop-out criteria were not
coherently defined. Macromorphological tumor progression
beyond the listing criteria or beyond the proposed down-staged
criteria excluded LT in many centers [15,16,25–27]. Such a
waiting list policy reduces the risk of tumor recurrence, however
for the price of an increasing rate of tumor-related drop-out and
mortality [28,29]. Contrary to this, tumor-associated patient de￾listing was determined by biological rather than macromorpho￾logical tumor progression in our series [18,20,28,30]. This may
reduce the risk of drop-out but will increase the hazard of tumor
recurrence post-LT. Decreasing vital tumor load prior to LT
seems to be mandatory in this context. Nevertheless, the impact of
IBT-induced tumor necrosis on recurrence-free outcome is very
limited.
Postinterventional tumor response was identified as the only
independent predictor of recurrence-free long-term survival
related to IBT in our series (Table 4,5). Other established features
of harmful tumor biology, such as microvascular invasion and
poor tumor differentiation have lost their independent predictive
power after including post-IBT tumor necrosis into our analysis.
This is an interesting result of our study. Even though IBT
capabilities to induce extensive tumor necrosis have already been
demonstrated [13–17,31–33], its impact on post-LT outcome is
undefined. Five-year recurrence-free survival rate was not
significantly different between patients receiving (78%) and those
not receiving IBT (68%) in our series (Fig. 3), which is comparable
to several other trials [25,26]. This may be in part related to the
retrospective study design and the relatively small sample size.
However, from a scientific point of view, it appears to be
inadequate to simply compare both populations. Liver transplant
candidates who were directed to IBT represent a pre-selected
subpopulation, since eligibility is determined by clinical condition,
liver function and tumor morphology. For a better understanding
of IBT capabilities in the transplant set-up, randomized controlled
trials may be useful. From an ethical point of view, however, they
are not to be expected, since effective antitumor treatment
alternatives are still lacking. We have therefore stratified our data
according to a histopathologic gold standard endpoint, which is
missing in most other trials. Our results clearly indicate that
extended tumor necrosis should be the major goal and posttrans￾plant outcome variable of IBT in the transplant setting.
Furthermore, our data suggest that postinterventional tumor
response may be a useful parameter of favourable tumor biology in
patients with advanced HCC on pretransplant clinical imaging.
Five-year recurrence-free survival rates were 80% and 75% in
successfully treated Milan Out and UCSF Out patients, respec￾tively (Fig. 5,6,7), which is completely comparable to Milan In
patients. This extraordinary outcome data points out that a subset
of patients with advanced HCC but with less aggressive tumor
biology may achieve excellent posttransplant outcome, although
exceeding standard criteria on pretransplant clinical staging. Based
on results of our trial, this special subpopulation may not be
excluded from LT, as it is, however, practice in many transplant
centers. In contrast, if IBT failed to induce extended tumor
necrosis, none of the patients with advanced HCC on radiograph￾ic imaging were still alive 5 years post-LT (Fig. 5,6,7). In the
context of a dramatic shortage of appropriate donor organs,
patients with such harmful tumor biology did retrospectively not
qualify for LT [34]. Thus, it seems to be of great importance to
identify pretransplant available clinical predictors of post-IBT
efficacy in order to improve selection process beyond the Milan
burden. Several imaging variables have been suggested to indicate
postinterventional tumor necrosis on cross sectional radiography
[35–37]. However, the experiences with correlating pre- and post￾IBT imaging features of HCC nodules with histopathologic
findings are still rather limited since only a minority of patients
qualify for liver surgery. That is the reason why reliable
radiographic features of post-IBT tumor necrosis have not been
yet defined [35–37]. Rates of tumor understaging by preoperative
imaging are still ranging between 20% and 40% [38,39].
Furthermore, the value of radiographic TACE responsiveness to
predict beneficial outcome in patients with advanced HCC is
discussed controversially. Otto et al. suggested that TACE-induced
progression-free follow-up could be an adequate clinical criterion
for indicating LT in HCC beyond the Milan burden [13]. In
contrast, TACE efficacy on radiographic imaging was not
associated with improved outcome in Milan Out patients in a
trial by Millonig et al. [40]. And just recently, Henry et al.
demonstrated that best radiological response to TACE did not
correlate with survival benefits in patients with unresectable HCC
[41].
In our IBT patients, none of macromorphological variables
defining the standard criteria but only negative PET status of
HCC was identified as independent pretransplant available
predictor of postinterventional tumor response (Table 6,7). Only
4 of 40 patients with 18F-FDG non-avid HCC (10%) emerged as
tumor non-responders to IBT, compared to 11 of 19 patients with
18F-FDG avid tumors (57,9%; P,0.001). To the best of our
knowledge, this interesting correlation has not been described
before. Although sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET for diagnosing and
detecting HCC is limited, it seems to have some importance for
describing biological tumor behaviour in the transplant setting.
Enhanced glucose metabolism on pretransplant PET was identi￾fied as useful clinical surrogate marker of poor tumor grading and
microvascular invasion, which are both well-known parameters of
tumor aggressiveness in HCC [18–20]. We have just recently
demonstrated that patients with PET negative advanced HCC
may achieve excellent outcome post-LT [30]. According our
current data, this may be triggered by extensive postinterventional
tumor necrosis, as none of 10 patients with PET negative (0%), but
7 of 12 patients with PET positive HCC exceeding the Milan
criteria (58,3%) have developed tumor recurrence post-LT,
respectively. Five liver transplant patients with PET positive
advanced HCC remained free from tumor recurrence and,
noteworthy, 4 of them revealed extended tumor necrosis at
explant pathology. If postinterventional tumor response might
have been indicated in these patients by a switch from PET +
status pre-IBT to PET 2 status post-IBT can not be answered by
our data, since we did not routinely perform follow-up PET scans.
This is a drawback of our trial.

There are some further limitations in our study. First, tumor
response data were assessed retrospectively and the sample size
was rather small. Furthermore, we have included patients after
different interventional procedures, although TACE was the
predominantly used locoregional intervention in our series. In
contrast, our data is powered by a concise prospective clinical
follow-up in a relatively high number of patients with advanced
HCC on radiographic imaging. Moreover, we have used clinical
but not histopathologic features of the Milan/UCSF criteria for
uni- and multivariate assessments.
In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that extended
postinterventional tumor necrosis is an indicator of favourable
tumor biology in the transplant setting. It promotes recurrence￾free long-term survival in liver transplant patients with HCC
beyond standard criteria on clinical imaging. Post-LT tumor
surveillance should be intensified in patients without tumor
response to IBT, since risk of tumor recurrence is significantly
increased. Pretransplant PET evaluation seems to be useful in
identifying those patients with HCC beyond standard criteria that
may benefit from IBT and, thereby, achieve an excellent long￾term survival. If postinterventional tumor response in patients with
PET positive tumors may be indicated by a decrease of 18F-FDG￾uptake patterns on PET has to be analyzed in a prospective
approach.
