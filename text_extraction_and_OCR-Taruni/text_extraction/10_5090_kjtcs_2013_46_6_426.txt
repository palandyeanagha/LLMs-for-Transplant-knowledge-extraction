Background: Heart transplantation has become a widely accepted surgical option for end-stage heart failure in 
Korea since its first success in 1992. We reviewed early postoperative complications and mortality in 239 patients 
who underwent heart transplantation using bicaval technique in Asan Medical Center. Methods: Between January 
1999 and December 2011, a total of 247 patients aged over 17 received heart transplantation using bicaval techni￾que in Asan Medical Center. After excluding four patients with concomitant kidney transplantation and four with 
heart-lung transplantation, 239 patients were enrolled in this study. We evaluated their early postoperative complica￾tions and mortality. Postoperative complications included primary graft failure, cerebrovascular accident, mediastinal 
bleeding, renal failure, low cardiac output syndrome requiring intra-aortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation insertion, pericardial effusion, and inguinal lymphocele. Follow-up was 100% complete with a mean fol￾low-up duration of 58.4±43.6 months. Results: Early death occurred in three patients (1.3%). The most common 
complications were pericardial effusion (61.5%) followed by arrhythmia (41.8%) and mediastinal bleeding (8.4%). 
Among the patients complicated with pericardial effusion, only 13 (5.4%) required window operation. The incidence 
of other significant complications was less than 5%: stroke (1.3%), low cardiac output syndrome (2.5%), renal fail￾ure requiring renal replacement (3.8%), sternal wound infection (2.0%), and inguinal lymphocele (4.6%). Most of 
complications did not result in the extended length of hospital stay except mediastinal bleeding (p=0.034). 
Conclusion: Heart transplantation is a widely accepted option of surgical treatment for end-stage heart failure with 
good early outcomes and relatively low catastrophic complications.

INTRODUCTION
Since the world’s first successful heart transplantation was 
performed by Dr. Christiaan Barnard in 1967, it has come to 
be regarded as a standard treatment for end-stage heart 
failure. The first heart transplantation was performed success￾fully in Korea in 1992 [1], and today, this procedure has be￾come a widely accepted surgical option [2,3]. The long-term 
results of heart transplantation in Korea are comparable with 
the results reported by the International Society of Heart and 
Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) [4,5].
From a surgical perspective, there are several operative

techniques and their modifications that are currently in use. 
Among them, the bicaval technique is known to be associated 
with a decreased incidence of atrial arrhythmias and reduced 
need for pacemaker implantation because of the preservation 
of normal atrial geometry and sinus function [6,7]. Since 
January 1999, we have employed the bicaval technique in￾stead of the standard biatrial technique [4]. Although both 
these techniques have shown excellent long-term outcomes as 
previously reported, few studies have evaluated their early 
postoperative outcomes, including early complications and 
mortality. Such postoperative outcomes need to be studied 
further as they are the primary areas of interest for cardiac 
surgeons.
Therefore, we reviewed the early postoperative complica￾tions and mortality in adult recipients who underwent heart 
transplantations at the Asan Medical Center, using the bicaval 
technique. We are presenting our experience with early post￾operative complications and their management, and the analy￾sis of early mortality.
METHODS
A retrospective chart review was carried out on all patients 
who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation using the bi￾caval technique between January 1999 and December 2011. 
A total of 286 patients underwent orthotopic heart trans￾plantation, and of these, 247 patients were 17 years or older. 
Among them, patients undergoing multi-organ transplantations 
were excluded: four patients with heart–lung transplantations 
and four patients with heart–kidney transplantations. Finally, 
239 patients were enrolled in this study, comprising the cur￾rent study population. Data were extracted from the pro￾spectively registered database of Asan Medical Center, and 
supplemental information was obtained by reviewing the rele￾vant medical records. The collected variables were basic dem￾ographic characteristics, preoperative diagnosis and laboratory
data, preoperative need for inotropic support, preoperative in￾tensive care unit (ICU) stay, preoperative mechanical circu￾latory support (MCS), total length of ICU and hospital stay, 
and postoperative complications. Postoperative complications 
included early graft failure, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), 
bleeding requiring re-exploration, renal failure requiring renal 
replacement therapy, low cardiac output syndrome requiring 
MCS, pericardial effusion, and inguinal lymphocele. This 
study was approved by the institutional ethics committee/re￾view board at the Asan Medical Center (no. S2012-2199- 
0001), which waived the requirement for informed consent 
because of the retrospective nature of this study.
1) Operative technique
During the harvest, the heart was procured using car￾dioplegia with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution 
(Custodiol HTK; Essential Pharmaceuticals, Newtown, PA, 
USA) injected through the aortic root cannula, with venting 
through the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the right upper pul￾monary vein. A heart allograft is usually flushed with 2 L of 
Custodiol HTK solution and preserved with the same 
solution. In the case when the cold ischemic time ＞120 mi￾nutes, 1 L of Custodiol HTK solution was infused again into 
the heart allograft before anastomosis in some of the cases.
All recipients were prepared in a manner similar to that in 
the case of other open heart surgeries. Standard median ster￾notomy was performed, and the preparation for cardiopulmo￾nary bypass (CPB) included aortic and bicaval cannulations. 
Efforts were made to cannulate the aorta and both the superi￾or and IVC as distally as possible. After the initiation of 
CPB, recipient cardiectomy was performed so that it could be 
completed simultaneously with the arrival of the donor heart. 
The bicaval technique sequenced the left atrial (LA) anasto￾mosis first, usually followed by the IVC, pulmonary artery 
(PA), aorta, and superior vena cava (SVC) anastomosis. 
Otherwise, anastomosis was performed in the sequence of 
LA, PA, aorta, IVC, and SVC. After the completion of anas￾tomosis, 500 mg of solumedrol was administered intra￾venously, followed by the declamping of the aorta. In sit￾uations in which there were concerns regarding the prolonged 
ischemic time, aortic anastomosis was performed with the 
subsequent declamping of the aorta before the rest of the 
anastomosis was completed. After the completion of anasto￾mosis, standard deairing maneuvers were performed, and the 
reperfusion of the implanted heart was begun. The entire pro￾cedure of anastomosis was performed under hypothermia us￾ing ice slush. After the patient was weaned off CPB, the usu￾al pericardial, mediastinal, and pleural chest tubes and a peri-

cardial soft drain (Hemovac Evacuators; Zimmer, Warsaw, 
IN, USA) were placed. Before closing the sternum, we placed 
a pair of ventricular pacing wires.
2) Postoperative management and immunosuppression
Prior to June 1999, the immunosuppression protocol con￾sisted of induction with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and meth￾ylprednisolone [4]. Thereafter, all patients received anti-inter￾leukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody (basiliximab) pre￾operatively at the day of surgery, and started again on post￾operative day 2. Intraoperatively, all patients received a bolus 
of methylprednisolone (500 mg), with tapering doses over 
months. Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept; Roche Laborato￾ries, Nutley, NJ, USA) was routinely started immediately af￾ter surgery, once the patient was extubated. Tacrolimus was 
usually given on postoperative day 2 once the creatinine level 
stabilized.
Once the patient was transferred to the ICU after surgery, 
the patient was given postoperative care in a manner similar 
to that in the case of other open heart surgery cases. After 
the patient was cleared off of mediastinal bleeding or neuro￾logic dysfunction, he/she was weaned off mechanical ven￾tilation and was usually extubated within 24 hours of surgery. 
We tried to maintain adequate vital signs: the target systolic 
blood pressure and heart rate was 110 to 130 mmHg and 90 
to 110 beats/min, respectively. Dopamine was the first choice 
of inotropes for maintaining adequate blood pressure, and the 
target heart rate was maintained using dobutamine and/or iso￾proterenol as appropriate. Further, we tried to maintain the 
urine output at least 100 mL/hr during the first 24 hours. 
When the systolic pulmonary blood pressure was greater than 
40 mmHg, iloprost (Ventavis; Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, 
Germany) inhalation was administered every 4 to 6 hours.
3) Follow-up
All patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy for the mon￾itoring of acute rejection. Biopsies were taken on a regular 
basis for a two-year period after surgery, as previously re￾ported [4]. A single expert cardiologist was involved in im￾mediate postoperative care and long-term medical manage￾ment at our institution. After the patients were discharged 
from the hospital, clinical follow-ups were performed during 
outpatient clinic visits. Follow-up was 100% complete with a 
mean follow-up duration of 58.4±43.6 months.
4) Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and 
percentages, and continuous variables as mean±standard 
deviation. Differences in baseline characteristics between the 
patient groups, categorized on the basis of the presence of 
complications, were compared using the Student t-test or 
Mann–Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the 
chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, 
as appropriate. The survival rates were calculated using the 
Kaplan–Meier method.
All reported p-values were two-sided, and values of p
＜0.05 were considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS 
ver. 19.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the 
statistical analysis.
RESULTS
1) Baseline characteristics
Of the 239 patients considered, 171 (71.5%) were male. 
Further, the mean age at the time of transplantation was 
45.1±12.5 years. Thirty-seven patients (15.5%) had undergone 
previous cardiac operations. Table 1 summarizes the baseline 
characteristics of all of the patients. The most common diag￾nosis among recipients was dilated cardiomyopathy (67.8%), 
followed by ischemic cardiomyopathy (13.4%) and hyper￾trophic cardiomyopathy (5.4%). Preoperative inotropic and 
mechanical support was provided to 114 patients (47.7%) and 
7 patients (2.9%), respectively. Meanwhile, the mean age of 
the cardiac donors was 31.9±10.3 years, and 190 of these do￾nors (79.5%) were male.
2) Early postoperative outcomes
There were three (1.3%) early deaths. Table 2 summarizes 
the early postoperative mortality and complications. The mean 
period of ICU stay was 6.7±3.1 days. Postoperative bleeding 
leading to exploration occurred in 20 patients (8.4%), among 
whom three experienced delayed bleeding at postoperative 
day 6, 7, and 20, respectively.
Renal replacement therapy due to renal failure was required

in 9 patients (3.8%), two of whom were already diagnosed 
with chronic renal failure preoperatively. One of them died of 
septic shock (patient 1 in Table 3) during continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT) support in the ICU. Five pa￾tients recovered renal function, but the remaining three pa￾tients required conventional hemodialysis after transfer to the
general ward. The median duration of CRRT among survivors 
was 4.5 days (interquartile range, 4 to 8.75 days).
CVA leading to death or permanent sequelae occurred in 
three patients (1.3%). One of them developed intracerebral 
hemorrhage during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO) support and died on postoperative day 7 (patient 2 
in Table 3). Two patients were found to develop cerebral in￾farction on postoperative day 2 and are currently being fol￾lowed up by neurologists in Asan Medical Center.
Sternal wound infection occurred in five patients (2.0%), 
and all of these patients underwent sternal wound revisions. 
Among them, one patient had delayed wound infection one 
month after surgery. There was no case of recurrence after 
sternal wound revision.
Four patients (1.7%) and two patients (0.8%) required 
ECMO and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, re￾spectively, due to low cardiac output or primary graft failure 
postoperatively. Of the four patients who were on post￾operative ECMO support, one patient died of intracerebral 
hemorrhage as described previously (patient 2 in Table 3). 
The other three were successfully weaned off ECMO support, 
and one of them underwent re-transplantation. The mean peri￾od of ECMO support was 3.75 days. Of the two patients who 
received IABP insertion, one underwent IABP insertion intra-

operatively and was successfully weaned off IABP on post￾operative day 2. The other received IABP insertion on post￾operative day 2, which was removed successfully after three 
days.
Postoperative arrhythmia documented on electrocardiogram 
(ECG) was observed in 100 patients (41.8%): right bundle 
branch block (RBBB) in 92 patients (35.8%), left bundle 
branch block (LBBB) in 3 patients (1.3%), and atrial fi￾brillation (AF) in 3 patients (1.3%). Patients whose ECG re￾vealed RBBB and AF did not have hemodynamic instability 
or its related complications during hospital stay. Only one pa￾tient who showed LBBB needed temporary pacemaker (TPM) 
implantation on postoperative day 1. The TPM was dis￾continued on postoperative day 2, and the patient was dis￾charged without significant rhythm-related morbidity.
Right ventricular (RV) failure manifested by decreased con￾tractility or RV chamber dilatation on echocardiography was 
observed in 19 patients (7.9%), none of whom showed hemo￾dynamic instability requiring MCS. All of these patients had 
gradual improvement of RV function according to the serial 
follow-up echocardiography.
Echocardiography also revealed pericardial effusion of 
varying amounts in 147 patients (61.5%), but most of them 
did not have hemodynamic significance. Among these pa￾tients, 13 (5.4%) underwent pericardiostomy or window 
operation.
Inguinal lymphocele occurred in 11 patients (4.6%), five of 
whom underwent surgical treatment by us or vascular sur￾geons in Asan Medical Center. The others showed improve￾ment of symptoms by conservative management. Notably, 
eight patients received cannulation via the femoral artery or 
the femoral vein during heart transplantation, implying that 
inguinal lymphocele is attributable to femoral cannulation.
Table 3 summarizes the clinical characteristics and the 
cause of death in the three patients with early mortality. In 
contrast to the gender predilection toward male among the re￾cipients, two out of the three patients were female. Two of 
the patients had preoperative liver dysfunction with varied 
etiology. Neither of them received preoperative ventilatory or 
mechanical support requiring ICU care. The most common 
cause of death was sepsis, which occurred in two patients. 
Throughout the study, there were 26 late deaths (10.8%), and 
the 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 95.1%, 
89.1%, and 76.3%, respectively.

Early Postoperative Complications after Heart Transplantation
− 431 −
We compared the length of hospital and ICU stay between 
the groups categorized on the basis of the presence of 
complications. In general, there was no difference in the 
length of hospital stay according to each complication, except 
mediastinal bleeding (p=0.034). The presence of renal failure 
requiring renal replacement therapy (p=0.003), ECMO in￾sertion (p=0.038), and arrhythmia (p=0.011) resulted in the 
prolongation of ICU stay, while the other complications did 
not affect the duration of ICU stay.
DISCUSSION
This study represents the experience with early post￾operative complications of adult heart transplantation accumu￾lated at the Asan Medical Center over a 13-year period, dur￾ing which significant advancement in organ procurement and 
operative techniques, refinement in perioperative care, and 
changes in immunosuppressive protocols were achieved. As 
previously reported, the long-term results of our institution 
were comparable to those reported by the ISHLT [5]. Despite 
this achievement in long-term outcomes, few studies have 
evaluated the early postoperative outcomes and complications 
after heart transplantation from the surgical perspective. This
encouraged us to systematically collect and review our expe￾rience, focusing on the less-studied aspects.
This study demonstrated that the early mortality was ex￾cellent [8], compared with that reported by other centers 
[9-11]. Due to the low incidence of early mortality, we were 
not able to identify the statistically significant risk factors for 
mortality. However, notably, two patients had preoperative 
hepatic dysfunction, which is compatible with previous stud￾ies suggesting an association between poor clinical outcomes 
and preoperative hepatic dysfunction [12]. The leading cause 
of early mortality was septic shock, followed by intracerebral 
hemorrhage, owing to anticoagulation during ECMO support. 
In contrast to the 30-day mortality reported by ISHLT, in 
which primary graft failure is the leading cause of death [5], 
graft failure was not listed as a cause of death in our study.
Other postoperative complications, including mediastinal 
bleeding, renal failure, early graft failure, CVA, and sternal 
wound infection reported in our study, could be compared fa￾vorably with those reported in other studies across the world 
[13-18]. These complications could be adequately managed 
with either a surgical or medical modality. The presence of 
complications did not make a difference in the length of ICU 
and hospital stay in a majority of cases; patients with renal 
failure, arrhythmia, and ECMO insertion had a longer ICU 
stay, and patients with mediastinal bleeding had a longer hos￾pital stay.
Our study recognized that the role of ECMO support has 
emerged as a preoperative bridge-to-transplantation as well as 
a postoperative bridge-to-recovery. Out of seven patients who 
received preoperative ECMO support and were bridged to 
transplantation, no one had postoperative mortality, and all of
them had successful recovery after transplantation. Only one 
case of early mortality was reported in the postoperative 
ECMO group (patient 2 in Table 3); the remaining three pa￾tients were successfully bridged to recovery. The successful 
outcome of using ECMO as a preoperative bridge-to-trans￾plantation and postoperative bridge-to-recovery indicates that 
ECMO support can be a viable option for managing pre￾operative end-stage heart failure patients and improving sur￾vival, particularly when compared with the general outcomes 
of ECMO support after major cardiac surgery. In addition, 
given the situation in Korea where ventricular assist device 
implantation is not generalized for patients with a failing 
heart [19] and ECMO support may be the only alternative 
option, the number of patients on the waiting list who may 
need preoperative ECMO support is expected to increase over 
time.
Our study showed that ECG-documented arrhythmias and 
pericardial effusion revealed by echocardiography were fre￾quently observed after heart transplantation. RBBB was the 
most commonly documented arrhythmia, but none of the pa￾tients with RBBB showed hemodynamic instability that re￾quired pacemaker insertion. It appears that RBBB after heart 
transplantation does not have clinically significant im￾plications; however, this needs to be further verified. 
Similarly, most of the pericardial effusion did not have hemo￾dynamic significance, and only 8.8% of pericardial effusion 
required a pericardiostomy or window operation. This result 
suggests that pericardial effusion without tamponade can be 
observed and needs serial follow-up. Whether the remnant 
pericardial effusion may cause long-term problems requires

further investigation.
This study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective 
and non-randomized study with observational data. Therefore, 
the results might be affected by unmeasured confounders. 
Second, this study incorporates the surgical outcomes of a 
thirteen-year period, performed by various surgeons. In spite 
of the use of the same technique, the difference in surgical 
outcomes among operating surgeons was not adequately 
reflected.
In conclusion, heart transplantation is a life-saving proce￾dure for patients with end-stage heart failure with good early 
outcomes and relatively low catastrophic complications. Most 
of the early postoperative complications could be adequately 
managed with surgical or medical treatment and did not re￾sult in an extended hospital stay. We hope that this study can 
be used as a reference and can provide guidance for post￾operative management after heart transplantation.
