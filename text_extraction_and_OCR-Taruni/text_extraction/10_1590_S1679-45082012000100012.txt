ABSTRACT
Objective: To compare low and high MELD scores and investigate 
whether existing renal dysfunction has an effect on transplant 
outcome. Methods: Data was prospectively collected among 237 
liver transplants (216 patients) between March 2003 and March 
2009. Patients with cirrhotic disease submitted to transplantation 
were divided into three groups: MELD ≥ 30, MELD < 30, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Renal failure was defined as a ± 25% 
decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate as observed 1 week 
after the transplant. Median MELD scores were 35, 21, and 13 for 
groups MELD ≥ 30, MELD < 30, and hepatocellular carcinoma, 
respectively. Results: Recipients with MELD ≥ 30 had more days 
in Intensive Care Unit, longer hospital stay, and received more blood 
product transfusions. Moreover, their renal function improved after 
liver transplant. All other groups presented with impairment of renal 
function. Mortality was similar in all groups, but renal function was 
the most important variable associated with morbidity and length 
of hospital stay. Conclusion: High MELD score recipients had 
an improvement in the glomerular filtration rate after 1 week of liver 
transplantation.

INTRODUCTION
The most frequent causes of liver disease are alcohol￾related (Laennec’s cirrhosis), cholestatic disorders 
(congenital or acquired), and viral hepatitis. These 
are also the most common etiologies for orthotopic 
liver transplantation (OLT). According to the United 
Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)(1), a total of 15,758 
candidates wait for an OLT in the United States alone. 
In Brazil, 6,505 patients wait for a liver transplant, 
according to the Associação Brasileira de Transplante de 
Órgãos (ABTO)(2).
Until February 2002 (in the United States) and 
June 2006 (in Brazil), patients were considered for OLT 

einstein. 2012;10(1):57-61

according to the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score(3), and 
therefore had to wait for a liver transplant depending 
exclusively on organ donor availability(4) and not on 
their own organ function indicators. After those dates, 
the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) began 
to be used and changed the listing criteria. 
MELD was first described in 2000, with the aim 
to predict 3-month survival rates among patients 
undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic 
shunts (TIPS)(5,6)
.
 Application of the MELD criteria to 
liver transplantation changed the allocation procedure 
from a waiting time-based to a risk-based system that 
considers the following variables: serum creatinine, 
bilirubin level, International Normalized Ratio (INR), 
and whether or not dialysis is required. 
Since then, MELD scores have been used to identify 
potential recipients with higher death risk. Priority is 
given to high MELD score individuals as an attempt to 
decrease the mortality of patients on the waiting list for 
OLT. 
As for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
an adjusted MELD score is established according to 
tumor staging, in which a MELD score of 24 corresponds 
to T1, and of 29 to T2. For these patients, the adjusted 
MELD is necessary because of the risk of these patients 
being eliminated from the list due to tumor progression 
or metastasis(7)
.
 Thus, these patients usually present 
with MELD scores < 30. 
While some authors showed that a high pre￾transplant MELD score may work as a predictor of 
postoperative complications(8,9)
,
 others found no correlation 
between the MELD score and patient outcome after 
transplantation(10-13). Therefore, despite the benefits of 
the MELD score system, investigators who adopt it as the 
main criterion for OLT must be aware of its limitations, 
which still impose the need for refinement. 
Some researchers(9,14) consider 25 as a high MELD 
score, while our group(15) and others(13) put the boundary 
at 30 or higher. As shown in other studies, successful 
OLT can be performed in patients presenting both high 
(MELD > 30) and low scores (MELD < 30)(15).
Improvements in outcomes following OLT increased 
long-term patient survival, which allowed identifying 
some long-term post-transplant complications. Chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) is one of these complications 
associated with decreased long-term patient survival, 
and a common one following liver transplant(16-20). CKD 
is classified according to its severity and the treatment 
required, and disease progression can lead to a severe 
renal insufficiency that requires renal transplantation(21).
Immunosuppressive drugs are nephrotoxic and 
therefore require careful pretransplant evaluation of 
renal function and close follow-up after OLT. Recent 
reports have described successful 1-year graft and 
patient survival rates (around 90%) with administration 
of low doses of immunosuppressors(22,23).
In high-MELD-score patients (range ≥ 30), impaired 
renal function due to a hepatorenal syndrome or to 
nephropathy secondary to other diseases is usually 
present as well. Although it has been suggested that 
OLT in these patients may compromise the success of 
the procedure and lead to higher costs due to extra 
requirements for blood transfusions, hemodialysis, and 
longer stays in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or in the 
hospital(19), researchers have reached no consensus. 
Official data from the State of São Paulo, Brazil, on 
patients awaiting OLT reveal that their average MELD 
score is 29. Such score may already be considered high 
for OLT, and is a consequence of the long waiting 
period on the OLT list because of insufficient deceased 
donors(15) and lack of transplant centers in some areas. 
In the United States, data from the UNOS suggest that 
longer waiting periods for OLT may start to occur there 
as well.
As the waiting list for an OLT is only getting 
longer, doctors and specialized centers should be better 
prepared to receive and treat patients presenting higher 
MELD scores. Thus, understanding the potential 
complications associated with using the MELD criteria 
and transplanting patients with higher MELD scores is 
now crucial.
OBJECTIVE
To compare low and high MELD score outcomes and 
investigate whether existing renal dysfunction has an 
effect on transplantation outcome. 
METHODS
The study was approved by the local institutional 
review committee of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein
(HIAE), São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected 
prospectively for 237 liver transplants performed in 
216 patients (21 were retransplanted), between March 
2003 and March 2009. 
The MELD score was calculated considering serum 
creatinine, total serum bilirubin, and the INR according 
to the formula(24) currently in use by UNOS and adopted 
by the State of São Paulo Health Department.
Patients with cirrhotic disease and submitted to 
OLT were divided into three groups: MELD ≥ 30 
(without HCC), MELD < 30 (without HCC), and HCC 
recipients. Patients who were considered as having

incidence was hepatitis C virus, and in the MELD ≥ 30 
Group it was Laennec’s cirrhosis.
Demographics and variables regarding postoperative 
follow-up are reported on table 2. 
The MELD ≥ 30 Group had a more prolonged 
hospital stay, mainly in the ICU, and the HCC Group 
had a shorter hospital stay. Renal function pre￾transplant was worse in patients in the MELD ≥ 30 
Group, improving after the transplant. For the MELD 
< 30 Group, renal function had a statistically significant 
impairment after the transplant. Although the HCC 
Group presented with impairment as well, only urea 
levels were found to be statistically significant (Table 3).
GFR levels decreased with a statistical significance 
only for the MELD < 30 Group (Table 3). Of these 
patients, 20 (48.8%) did not need hemodialysis in the 
early post-transplant period, 6 (14.6%) required it only 
in the first days (less than 1 week after transplant), and 
15 (36.6%) for longer than 1 week.
priority, either because of severe acute hepatic failure 
or of need for retransplantation were excluded from 
this study. 
Groups were compared regarding demographics, 
hepatic and renal function (measured by glomerular 
filtration rate – GFR), intraoperative blood product 
transfusions, length of stay in either the hospital or in 
the ICU, retransplantation, and early survival (30 days).
The immunosuppression protocol adopted was 
the same for all recipients and included a three-drug 
regimen with CNI, MMF or mycophenolate sodium, 
and steroids for the first 12 weeks. 
Severe CKD was defined in accordance with the 
National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality 
Initiative(25) as a GFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2
. Renal 
failure was defined as the need for renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) in the form of chronic dialysis or kidney 
transplantation. Primary renal disease (PRD) was 
defined as a ± 25% decline in estimated post-transplant 
GFR. Calculation of GFR was performed with the 
modified diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula in its 
abbreviated form(21):
GFR = 186 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) - 1.154 x 
age (years) - 0.203 x 0.7422 (if female)
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were summarized by means and 
standard deviations (SD) when normally distributed, and 
by medians and range otherwise. Comparisons between 
the three groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA 
and Kruskall-Wallis tests for normal and non-normal 
data, respectively. Categorical variables were compared 
by χ2
 and Fisher’s exact tests. The paired t test was used 
to compare renal function parameters pre- and post￾liver transplant. For urea and creatinine levels, data 
were log-transformed to achieve a normal distribution. 
The significance level was 0.05. Calculations were 
performed by Statistical Package for the Social Science 
software (SPSS, Chicago, Ill), version 17.0.
RESULTS 
A total of 151 recipients of liver transplant were included 
in this study, which excluded individuals with severe 
acute hepatic failure or the need for retransplantation. 
They were divided into three groups: MELD ≥ 30 
(n = 41), MELD < 30 (n = 78), and HCC (n = 32). All 
recipients had a deceased donor. Requirement for liver 
retransplantation did not differ among groups (p = 0.439). 
Etiologies of cirrhosis are described on table 1.
There was statistical difference regarding the main 
causes of cirrhosis: in the HCC Group the highest

Patients in the MELD ≥ 30 Group received more 
blood product transfusions than those in the other two 
groups (Table 4).
Recipient 3-month survival was similar in the three 
groups, with no statistical difference (Table 5).
MELD scores experienced longer ICU and hospital 
stays. The requirement for intraoperative blood product 
transfusions occurred more often among patients in the 
MELD ≥ 30 Group than in those in the MELD < 30 
Group (Table 4), with the exception of one patient with 
a high MELD score who did not require any transfusion. 
There was no difference in retransplantation incidence 
and in the three-month survival rate among the groups. 
Early survival rates in this study were comparable to 
survival rates found in literature(3,15) and registries(1, 26).
Ravaioli et al.(13,27) found no correlation between 
survival outcomes after liver transplantation and 
recipient MELD scores. In contrast, some authors 
used the MELD score established immediately before 
the procedure, or the score calculated during the first 
week after surgery, as a predictor of patient survival(28). 
We observed a similar survival rate among the groups. 
In our study, we did not note worse early survival rate 
outcomes after liver transplantation in higher MELD 
score patients. This finding supports some prior results 
described by our group when working with a smaller 
group of patients(15). 
The MELD system allocation leads to the 
identification of the sickest patients, allowing them 
to be given priority on the OLT list. Perhaps a 
better approach for liver allocation, as some authors 
suggested(27), would be based on giving priority to 
those patients at a higher risk of dropping out from the 
list, but with a good prospect for survival after OLT. 
Another consideration is the quality of the graft used 
for the sickest patients. Some authors suggested that 
best results were achieved when using optimal donors 
in higher risk recipients(14,29). 
PRD and CKD are common complications after liver 
transplantation and are associated with poor clinical 
outcomes, including dependence on hemodialysis, 
kidney transplant, cardiovascular disease, and death. 
Liver transplant recipients with HCV are known to 
have an increased risk for CKD(22). Recipients with 
nephrotoxicity after liver transplantation who received 
MMF with a subsequent CNI dose reduction show 
improvement in renal function(22,29). We used a three￾drug regimen that included CNI, steroids, and MMF 
or mycophenolate sodium, and obtained a lower rate 
of PRD. Liver transplant recipients with MELD ≥ 30 
scores showed improved GFR after the transplant. 
Although GFR decreased in the two other groups, no 
significant renal dysfunction was observed (Table 3).
We questioned whether existing renal dysfunction 
after one week of the procedure has a significant effect 
on morbidity and mortality of OLT patients and what 
this effect might be when low and high MELD scores

DISCUSSION 
The most frequent causes of liver cirrhosis were similar 
in the three groups. As expected, patients with higher

are considered. Even though we have found similar 
survival rates among groups, the lengths of hospital and 
ICU stays were longer in the high MELD Group, and 
the incidence of PRD was greater. 
CONCLUSION
Greater renal function compromise increased morbidity 
while no changes in mortality were observed in the 
three groups, although renal patients required more 
resources. High MELD recipients had an improvement 
in GFR after one week of OLT.
