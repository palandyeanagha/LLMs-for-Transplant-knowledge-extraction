Background/Aims: Biliary strictures remain one of the most 
challenging aspects after living donor liver transplantation 
(LDLT). The aim of this study was to assess long-term out￾come of endoscopic treatment of biliary strictures occurring 
after LDLT and to identify risk factors of recurrent biliary stric￾tures following endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) 
in LDLT. Methods: A total of 1,106 patients underwent LDLT 
from May 1995 to May 2014. We compared the risk factors 
between patients with and without recurrent biliary strictures. 
Results: Biliary strictures developed in 24.0% of patients. 
Technical success rate of ERBD for biliary stricture after LDLT 
was 66.2% (145/219). Among 145 patients managed by 
endoscopic drainage, stricture resolution occurred in 69 with 
median duration of stent indwelling of 13.6 months (range, 
0.5 to 67.3 months), and stricture recurrence was seen in 
20 (21.3%) out of 94. The median recurrence-free duration 
after final endoscopic success was 13.1 months (range, 0.5 
to 67.3 months). Older donor age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.17; p=0.004) and 
non-B, non-C liver cirrhosis (HR, 5.10; 95% CI, 1.10 to 25.00; 
p=0.043) were associated with higher recurrence of biliary 
stricture. Conclusions: Long-term stricture resolution rate 
after ERBD insertion for biliary stricture occurring after LDLT 
was 73.4%. Clinicians should pay careful attention during 
following-up to decide when to remove ERBD in patients who 
have factors associated with recurrent biliary strictures. (Gut

INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation (LT) has become a lifesaving technique 
for patients with end-stage liver disease. With improved sur￾vival of transplanted liver, biliary complications have become 
an increasing concern in patients with prolonged survival fol￾lowing LT. Biliary complications, including biliary strictures, 
bile leaks, stones, and ampullary dysfunction, have remained 
significant causes of morbidity and mortality after LT.1
 Biliary 
stricture is the most common and intractable complication in 
adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).2,3 Bile duct stric￾tures have been estimated to occur in 12% to 35.6% of all LDLT 
patients.2,4,5 Previous studies have reported that biliary stricture 
typically developed in late post-LT period (>3 months), among 
those biliary complications.6-9 Biliary strictures are the major 
causes of morbidity after LDLT. Furthermore, biliary strictures 
are more complicated and difficult to be resolved after LDLT 
than deceased donor LT.2,4,10,11
Biliary strictures can be managed with endoscopic procedure, 
percutaneous approach, or surgical method. Nowadays, endo￾scopic procedures have shown marked improvement. They are 
the treatment of choice in patients with biliary strictures after 
LDLT.12-14 Patients with biliary strictures that occur after LDLT 
with duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis is routinely undergo en￾doscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to treat 
biliary stricture. Advantages of ERCP are easy endoscopic acces￾sibility of the stricture and relatively less invasiveness than per￾cutaneous approach or surgical method. In addition, endoscopic 
procedures have been successfully used to manage anastomotic 
stricture and non-anastomotic stricture following LDLT.15

Close surveillance for biliary stricture appears to be necessary 
for at least three years after LDLT.16 However, the risk factors of 
biliary stricture and optimal time for a clinician to remove the 
endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) after endoscopic 
treatment of biliary stricture of LDLT are unclear. Severe biliary 
complications such as cholangitis can occur when the endos￾copist removes the ERBD too early. On the other hand, patient 
can spend unnecessary medical cost on further ERCP to change 
ERBD when it is removed too late.17
The aim of this study was to assess long-term outcome of en￾doscopic treatment of biliary stricture occurring after LDLT and 
to identify risk factors of recurrent biliary stricture after endo￾scopic treatment following LDLT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This study enrolled 1,441 patients who underwent LT be￾tween May 1996 and May 2014 at Samsung Medical Center. Of 
these, 335 were excluded because of retransplantation (n=55) or 
deceased donor LT (n=280). Of the remaining 1,106 LDLT pa￾tients, biliary complications occurred in 304 patients, including 
biliary stricture (n=265), bile leak and biloma (n=32), and biliary 
stricture with bile leak (n=7). Among these 265 patients, 241 
with clinically suspected biliary stricture underwent ERCP. Nine 
patients received the reconstructive surgery and 15 received 
percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage in 24 patients who 
did not undergo ERCP. Patients were assessed for biliary stric￾ture was assessed when they presented with symptoms, such as 
abdominal pain, jaundice, and an itching sensation when pa￾tients showed abnormal laboratory findings including elevated 
liver enzyme levels or hyperbilirubinemia, or when patients had 
dilated bile duct on ultrasonography or computed tomography.18
If patients were diagnosed with biliary strictures, ERCPs with 
ERBDs were performed.
Among 241 patients who underwent ERCP, 22 individuals 
displayed a minimal biliary stricture that needed only balloon 
dilatation while 74 patients did not receive ERBD (Fig. 1).
We followed up 145 patients with successful ERBD for more 
than 12 months. ERBDs were removed in 94 due to improve￾ment of biliary stricture. Among these 94 patients in the ERBD 
removal group, 25 experienced recurrence of biliary stricture. 
Five of these 25 recurrences occurred within the first 3 months 
and 20 recurred after 3 months. Occurrence of the biliary stric￾ture within the 3 months after ERBD removal appeared to be a 
residual stricture and not a recurrence (Fig. 2).6-9 We compared 
the clinical factors between patients with and without recur￾145 Successful ERBD 74 Failed ERBD

rence of biliary stricture.
To identify the risk factors of the recurrent biliary stricture af￾ter endoscopic treatment following LDLT, we analyzed recipient 
factors, donor factors, laboratory results, LT-related factors, and 
endoscopic procedure-related factors. ERCP images and medical 
records were reviewed retrospectively. The Institutional Review 
Board of Samsung Medical Center approved the study protocol 
(IRB number: 2016-01-054). Informed consent was waived.

1. Endoscopic procedures 
The ERCP techniques for LDLT patients were similar to those 
for patients with benign strictures of biliary system (Fig. 3). Af￾ter bile duct cannulation, an injection of a contrast dye revealed 
the distal and proximal parts of the anastomosis. When proxi￾mal part was not visualized after a simple dye injection, bal￾loon-assisted cholangiography was tried. After biliary strictures 
were confirmed, small biliary sphincterotomy was performed 
and a guidewire was passed through the biliary strictures. Stric￾ture were dilated with a 6- to 10-mm dilation balloon at 3 to 11 
atm for 30 seconds. If the proximal bile ducts were separated, 
two guidewires were inserted to both anterior and posterior 
intrahepatic bile ducts. One or two plastic stents (7, 8.5, or 10 
Fr) and/or fully covered metal stents (FCMS) were then placed 
across the stricture for drainage. Proportion of plastic stent and 
FCMS among the 89 ERBD removal patients were 91.0% (81 out 
of 89) and 9% (8 out of 89), respectively. We decided the num￾ber, size and form of the stents based on the stricture morphol￾ogy, the tip shape of the distal duct and the angle between the 
proximal and distal ducts. ERCP was conducted electively at a 
3-month interval or in patients with evidence of cholangitis or 
liver biochemistry abnormality for ERBD exchange. Previously 
inserted ERBD was removed by snares or alligator retrieval for￾ceps. End of treatment was determined by stricture resolution 
using cholangiogram of biliary stricture resolution (>50% than 
proximal duct), contrast passage of the stricture site after ERBD 
removal and balloon sweeping of the stricture site without re￾sistance. In most cases of failed ERBD, the most difficult steps 
were the guidewire passages. Success of primary endoscopic 
management was defined as the successful placement of a 
ERBD through the stricture site.
2. Definition of success and recurrence after endoscopic 
procedure
Resolution of biliary stricture with endoscopic intervention 
was defined as the presence of the following: (1) resolution of 
cholestasis, (2) complete resolution of clinical symptoms, (3) no 
subsequent requirement for interventional procedures, and (4) 
biliary stricture resolution (>50% than proximal duct) on chol￾angiogram. Biliary stricture recurrence was defined as the pres￾ence of the following: (1) the presence of recurrent stricture on 
cholangiography after resolution of stricture, at least 3 months 
after the removal of stent, (2) requirement of additional endo￾scopic procedure for the resolution of stricture. 
3. Statistical analyses
The Pearson chi-square test and the Student t-test were used 
to identify statistical significances of different clinical variables. 
Multivariate analysis with the logistic regression was performed 
for variables with p<0.05 on simple logistic regression. Statisti￾cal analyses were executed using Stata 11.1 software (StataCorp., 
College Station, TX, USA). 
RESULTS 
Baseline characteristics of the 145 patients with successful 
ERBD are presented in Table 1. Their median age was 53 years 
(range, 16 to 69 years). Most patients (84%) of them were males. 
Underlying disease at the time of LT was hepatocellular carci￾noma (HCC) in 74 (51%), hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus 
related cirrhosis in 53 (37%), and cirrhosis by other causes in 18 
(12%). The median interval between the time of LT and endo￾scopic procedure was 6.6 months (range, 0.79 to 93.4 months) 
(Table 1). 
Following LDLT, biliary stricture occurred in 265 (24.0%) of 
1,106 LDLT patients (24.0%). The success rate of endoscopic 
treatment of biliary stricture was 66.2% (145/219). Recurrence

rate of biliary stricture after endoscopic treatment was 21.3%. 
Median follow-up was 27.1 months (range, 4.2 to 48.1 months) 
(Table 2). Two hundred and sixty-five cases were diagnosed 
with biliary stricture after LDLT, and ERCP was attempted in 
that of 241 cases. Of these 241 cases, biliary stricture was mini￾mal in 22 cases. Thus, it was sufficient to improve biliary stric￾ture with only balloon dilatation. Then, we tried the ERBD in 
219 cases. ERBD was finally successful in 66.2% (145/219) (Fig. 
1) and performed successfully at the first time in 118 (53.9%) 
(Fig. 2). Among 145 patients managed by endoscopic drain￾age, structure resolution occurred in 69 (69/145) with median 
duration of ERBD indwelling of 13.6 months (range, 0.5 to 67.3 
months). Stricture recurrence was seen in 21.3% (20/ 94). The 
median recurence-free duration after final endoscopic success 
was 13.1 months (range, 0.5 to 67.3 months). Median number of 
ERCP sessions and duration needed for final endoscopic success 
was 1 (range, 1 to 3) and 1 day (range, 1 to 44 days), respec￾tively (Table 2). 
Underlying diseases at the time of LT were HCC, cirrhosis due 
to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, and cirrhosis by other 
causes. Rates of these three underlying diseases were not sig￾nificantly different between resolution and recurrence groups 
(p=0.131, p=0.559, and p=0.096, respectively). Recipient age 
and sex ratio were similar between the resolution and recur￾rence groups (p=0.144 and p=0.826, respectively). There were 
no significant differences the rate of diabetes mellitus (p=0.327), 
hypertension (p=0.329), Child-Turcotte-Pugh class at time of 
LT (p=0.195), MELD score at the time of LT (p=0.385), or donor 
male/female sex ratio (p=0.247). At the time of LT, liver bio￾chemistry analyses were similar in the two groups; poor glucose 
control the next morning after LT was also similar in the two 
groups (p=0.712). Median donor age in the resolution group (29 
years; range, 16 to 57 years) was significantly younger than in 
the recurrence group (37 years; range, 17 to 62 years) (p=0.007) 
(Table 3).
Group similarities included LT-related factors of ducto￾plasty (p=0.942), operation time (p=0.466), cold ischemia time 
(p=0.820), warm ischemia time (p=0.155), ductal stent inser￾tion rate (p=0.397), bile duct size (p=0.524), multiplicity rate of 
grafted bile ducts (p=0.289), and number of donor ducts 1/2/3 
(p=0.524) (Table 3). Further similarities between the two groups 
included LT-to-ERCP interval (p=0.992), number of ERBD ses￾sions to success (p=0.762), total ERBD diameter (p=0.765), FCMS 
(p=0.555), median number of sessions until ERBD removal 
(p=0.724), median duration of ERBD indwelling (p=0.509), wide 
stricture morphology (p=0.821), narrow stricture morphology 
(p=0.372), non-visualization of the proximal duct (p=0.539), ta￾pered and round shape of the distal ducts (p=1.000 and p=0.589, 
respectively), and angles between the proximal and distal ducts 
(Table 3, Fig. 4).

ture after removal of ERBD. Overall, the HRs on multivariate￾adjusted analysis revealed that cirrhosis by other causes (HR, 
5.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 25.00; p=0.043) and 
donor age (HR, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.17; 
p=0.004) were independent predictive factors of the recurrence 
of biliary stricture after endoscopic treatment (Table 4). 
Fig. 5 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve of cumulative patency 
probability of bile duct after ERBD removal. Among 94 patients, 
persistent stricture resolution was achieved in 69 patients (73.4%) 
during the follow-up period (median, 27.1 months; range, 4.2 to 
48.1 months). The recurrence of biliary stricture occurred in 25 
patients (26.6 %) of the ERBD removal group (Fig. 2). ERBD re￾insertion was conducted in 23 patients of the recurrence group 
and the other two patients were managed with percutaneous 
transhepatic biliary drainage. There was no ERBD migration 
among the 18 ERBD re-inserted patients. Cholangitis was the 
most common post-ERCP complication among the 18 ERBD 
re-inserted patients (2/18, 11.1%). The other complication was 
pancreatitis (1/18, 5.6%). There was no patient who lost a graft 
due to complications of endoscopic management.
DISCUSSION
In our study, the causes at the time of LT and a donor age 
were associated with the recurrence of the biliary stricture fol￾lowing LDLT. Proven etiologic factors of biliary strictures after 
LT include were the small bile duct diameter, an unmatched￾size between recipient and graft bile ducts, tissue ischemia, ten￾sion at the anastomosis, infection, and other technical issues.19
However, the risk factors that influence the outcomes of the en￾doscopic management have not been well characterized. In the 
present study, we investigated recipient factors, donor factors, 
LT-related factors, and endoscopic procedure-related factors as￾sociated with recurrence of biliary stricture after ERBD removal. 
In our study, non-B, non-C liver cirrhosis and donor age 
were independent predictive factors of the recurrence of bili￾ary stricture after endoscopic treatment. These are the potential 
explanations for our results. First, cirrhosis by other causes 
such as toxic hepatitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, Wilson disease 
and glycogen storage disease were not completely cured or con￾trolled after LDLT. On the other hand, in the cases of HCC, LDLT 
was performed as an established curative treatment. And also, 
patients with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus-related cirrho￾sis could be completely cured or controlled with antiviral agent 
including direct-acting antiviral for hepatitis C virus after LDLT. 
Second, regarding donor age, the younger the age, the lower the 
probability of being affected by these proven etiologic factors of 
biliary strictures after LT as mentioned above.
Initially, we postulated that complicated biliary strictures 
would be associated with recurrence after removal of ERBD. 
However, we found no significant association between recur￾rence and stricture morphology. A previous retrospective cohort 
study in another institution has revealed similar result.20 In fact, 
it was difficult to define the exact point of the anastomosis site 
and distinguish between anastomotic and non-anastomotic 
stricture on the cholangiography.21
Recently, endoscopic intervention for benign biliary strictures 
after LDLT has attempted to place maximum-sized and multiple 
stents and to maintain a longer duration of stenting in order to 
avoid recurrence.13,14,22 The failure rate of primary ERCP may be

high in patients with late onset and delayed diagnosis of biliary 
stricture.17 The recurrence seemed to occur frequently in patients 
with a short duration of stenting, although it was not statisti￾cally significant in our study. 
Biliary stricture formations are typically due to ischemia/
perfusion injury, vascular insufficiency, or fibrotic healing 
caused by improper technique.6,9 Plus, close surveillance for bili￾ary stricture appears necessary for at least the first 3 years after 
LDLT.16 Elevated liver enzyme suggested biliary stricture follow￾ing LDLT. Hyperbilirubinemia following LT can occur as a result 
of ischemia/perfusion injury, cytomegalovirus infection, acute 
rejection, and biliary stricture.23 In our study, liver biochemistry 
analyses were not significantly different between resolution 
and recurrence groups at the time of LT. Cholangiography is the 
gold standard diagnostically and in allowing therapeutic inter￾vention in the same setting.24
Endoscopic procedures have progressed tremendously. They 
are considered the treatment of choice for biliary strictures after 
LDLT.12 Recent studies have reported success rates of 68% to 
86.4% in endoscopic intervention of LDLT to 86.4%.5,10,11,20 In 
our institution, ERBD was performed immediately in 118 (53.9%) 
patients. After two or three endoscopic sessions, 145 (66.2%) 
patients succeeded. This relatively low success rate compared 
to recent studies might be due to difference in study popula￾tion, period and method (type of stent). One retrospective cohort 
study has found that the reason of the relatively low success 
rates is related to technically difficult endoscopic procedure in 
treatment of post-LDLT biliary stricture.20 The most common 
reason for the failure of endoscopic treatment is the inability to 
cannulate the stricture.10,25
The number of ERBD sessions to success was similar in the 
resolution and recurrence groups. In another study, an average 
of 6.3 endoscopic sessions and 122.7 months were required to 
achieve final endoscopic success.20 The median number of ERCP 
sessions for final endoscopic success was 1 (range, 1 to 3) and 
median follow-up month for patients with endoscopic therapy 
was 27.1 months (range, 4.2 to 48.1 months). Multiple sessions 
of balloon dilatation followed by the endoscopic placement of 
plastic stents is the most commonly adopted strategy for the 
treatment of anastomotic biliary stricture after LDLT. The suc￾cess rates with multiple plastic stents could be higher with a 
more prolonged treatment of 12 months or longer.26
In this study, the median duration of LT-to-ERCP interval was 
6.9 months (range, 0.7 to 93.4 months) in the resolution group 
and 5.4 months (range, 0.7 to 63.1 months) in the recurrence 
group. Strictures tend to occur at 5 to 8 months after ortho￾topic LT with the majority of them presenting within 1 year,9,27
although their prevalence might continue to increase with the 
time after transplantation.28 Current endoscopic strategies to 
correct biliary strictures following LT include balloon dilation 
and the placement of multiple side-by-side plastic stents.29 Re￾cently, a study group has reported the long-term outcome of 
endoscopic biliary drainage after LDLT using inside-stent which 
is placed plastic stent proximal to the sphincter of Oddi without 
endoscopic sphincterotomy.30 One multicenter study has dem￾onstrated the effectiveness of FCMS in the treatment of biliary 
stricture after LDLT.31 In our study, FCMS were used in 10.14% 
of cases in the resolution group and 5% in the recurrence group. 
Only one recurrence case was noted in our study with FCMS. 
However, the number of patients treated with FCMS was insuf￾ficient for statistical significance. 
Our study has several limitations. First, we used a retrospec￾tive cohort with the potential of selection bias. Participants 
who underwent LDLT and ERCP during an 18-year period were 
included. Due to this long study period, different gastroenter￾ologists and surgeons were involved. This might have resulted 
in inter-observer or intra-observer variations. Second, as men￾tioned earlier, the definition of the anastomosis stricture site was 
not exactly determined. Sometimes, it could be very subjective 
on cholangiography. Thus, prospective validation studies with 
standardized anastomosis stricture site diagnoses are required to 
confirm our results. Third, we may have underestimated the rate 
of post-ERCP complications due to lack of description of sub￾jective symptoms and irregular follow-up interval. Nevertheless, 
the present study has clinical significance in that it assessed 
long-term outcome of endoscopic treatment of biliary stricture 
occurring after LDLT and identified risk factors of recurrent 
biliary stricture after endoscopic treatment following LDLT in a 
large cohort study. 
In conclusion, younger donor age was associated with lower 
recurrence rate while non-B, non-C liver cirrhosis such as toxic 
hepatitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, Wilson disease, hepatitis A vi￾rus infection, and glycogen storage disease were associated with 
higher recurrence rate of biliary stricture. Long-term stricture 
resolution of the ERBD of biliary stricture occurring after LDLT 
was 73.4%. Thus, clinician should be careful when performing 
ERBD removal. Close follow up is needed for cases with risk 
factors associated with recurrent biliary stricture.
