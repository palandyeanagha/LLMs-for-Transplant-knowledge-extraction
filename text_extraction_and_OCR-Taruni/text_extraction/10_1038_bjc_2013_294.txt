Background: Solid organ transplant recipients have high risk of lymphomas, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). A gap in our understanding of post-transplant lymphomas involves the spectrum and associated risks of
their many histologic subtypes.
Methods: We linked nationwide data on solid organ transplants from the US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
(1987–2008) to 14 state and regional cancer registries, yielding 791 281 person-years of follow-up for 19 distinct NHL subtypes and
HL. We calculated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and used Poisson regression to compare SIRs by recipient age,
transplanted organ, and time since transplantation.
Results: The risk varied widely across subtypes, with strong elevations (SIRs 10–100) for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, Burkitt’s
lymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (both systemic and primary
cutaneous forms). Moderate elevations (SIRs 2–4) were observed for HL and lymphoplasmacytic, peripheral T-cell, and marginal
zone lymphomas, but SIRs for indolent lymphoma subtypes were not elevated. Generally, SIRs were highest for younger recipients
(o20 years) and those receiving organs other than kidneys.
Conclusion: Transplant recipients experience markedly elevated risk of a distinct spectrum of lymphoma subtypes. These findings
support the aetiologic relevance of immunosuppression for certain subtypes and underscore the importance of detailed
haematopathologic workup for transplant recipients with suspected lymphoma.
Organ transplantation is a lifesaving option for individuals with
end-stage organ disease, and over 28 000 solid organ transplanta￾tions are performed yearly in the United States. However, solid
organ transplant patients must receive intensive long-term
immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection of the transplant,
putting them at high risk of developing post-transplant lympho￾proliferative disorders (PTLDs). These disorders include a
spectrum of potentially deadly lymphoid cell proliferations,
including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lym￾phoma (HL) (Tsao and Hsi, 2007). The NHL represents one of the
most common malignancies diagnosed after transplant (Andreone
et al, 2003). Risk in transplant recipients is estimated as 3- to 21-
fold higher than that in the general population, and perhaps as
much as 120-fold higher among children who receive transplants
(Kasiske et al, 2004; Busnach et al, 2006; Caillard et al, 2006; Vajdic
et al, 2006; Giordano et al, 2007; Grulich et al, 2007; Serraino et al,
2007; Jiang et al, 2008, 2010; Baccarani et al, 2009; Vajdic and van
Leeuwen, 2009; Quinlan et al, 2010; Engels et al, 2011). The NHL
risk exhibits a U-shaped pattern over time following transplanta￾tion, with risk being highest in the first year after transplant, falling

subsequently, and then increasing again at 5 or more years
after transplant (van Leeuwen et al, 2009; Quinlan et al, 2011).
HL was once considered aetiologically distinct from NHL,
but is now recognised as similar to some B-cell NHL
subtypes. Risk of HL among transplant recipients is likely lower
than that for NHL, having been reported as 2- to 3.6-fold higher
than that in the general population (Quinlan et al, 2010; Engels
et al, 2011).
A major gap in our understanding of transplant-related
lymphoma involves the spectrum and associated risks of the many
histologic subtypes of lymphoma, which are heterogeneous with
respect to clinical and epidemiologic characteristics (Morton et al,
2006; Swerdlow et al, 2008). The two prior studies examining the
risk of NHL subtypes among transplant recipients reported
substantial elevation in the risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL, the most common subtype in most populations) but no
increase for follicular lymphoma (another common subtype in
the general population) (Quinlan et al, 2010; Vajdic et al, 2010).
These studies were hampered by small numbers, especially of
uncommon NHL subtypes, and did not examine how the
occurrence of NHL subtypes varied by demographic characteristics
or time since transplantation.
Better characterisation of the risk of lymphoma subtypes in
transplant recipients would help clinicians caring for these patients,
as different subtypes require different management. This infor￾mation would also improve understanding of the causal impor￾tance of immunosuppression. Therefore, we assessed the risks of
individual lymphoma subtypes in the recently completed Trans￾plant Cancer Match Study (Engels et al, 2011). This large cohort of
US solid organ transplant recipients, for whom cancer ascertain￾ment was conducted uniformly via linkage with population-based
cancer registries, enabled us to quantify the risks of specific
subtypes overall and according to recipient age at transplantation,
type of transplanted organ, and time since transplant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Transplant cancer match study. The Transplant Cancer Match
Study is described in detail elsewhere (http://transplantmatch.
cancer.gov) (Engels et al, 2011). In brief, the US Scientific Registry
of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) was linked with 14 US
population-based cancer registries. The SRTR includes structured
data regarding all US solid organ transplants occurring since 1987,
including recipient demographic characteristics, reason for trans￾plant, and characteristics of the transplanted organs. The cancer
registries include standardised information regarding patient
demographic characteristics and detailed tumour characteristics.
Serial record linkages were completed between the SRTR and
the following central cancer registries, together covering B42% of
the US transplant patient population: California (years of coverage:
1988–2008), Colorado (1988–2006), Connecticut (1973–2006),
Georgia (1995–2008), Hawaii (1973–2007), Illinois (1986–2007),
Iowa (1973–2007), Michigan (1985–2006), New Jersey (1979–
2006), New York (1976–2007), North Carolina (1990–2007),
the Seattle-Puget Sound area of Washington State (1974–2008),
Texas (1995–2006), and Utah (1973–2008). Record linkages were
accomplished using a computer algorithm followed by manual
review and confirmation of potential matches. Analyses were
restricted to transplant recipients residing in geographic areas
covered by the cancer registries during the specified time periods.
The TCM Study was approved by human subjects research
review committees at the National Cancer Institute and the
following cancer registries: California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New Jersey, New York,
Seattle-Puget Sound, Texas, and Utah. It was formally exempted
from human subjects research approval at the Health
Resources and Services Administration and the North Carolina
cancer registry.
Lymphoma outcomes and follow-up. The NHLs were identified
in transplant recipients through linkage with cancer registries.
Lymphoma subtypes were classified using International Classifi￾cation of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition (ICD-O-3) site and
histology codes according to current International Lymphoma
Epidemiology (InterLymph) Consortium consensus guidelines
(Turner et al, 2010). Transplant recipients were considered at risk
of lymphoma beginning at the date of transplantation or the start
of cancer registry coverage (whichever came later). Hispanics were
followed beginning in 1992 to correspond to the years for which
general population rates were available for comparison (see below).
Follow-up time ended at the first diagnosis of any lymphoma
subtype, death, failure of a transplanted organ, subsequent
transplant, loss to follow-up, or last date of cancer registry
coverage (whichever came first). Recipients were considered
at risk separately during successive transplant episodes. Of the
180 210 distinct transplant episodes, we excluded 1265 because
racial/ethnic information was missing or did not correspond to a
group for which general population cancer rates were available,
and a further 160 episodes occurring among recipients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection reported to the SRTR.
We did not exclude episodes if the recipient had a history of
cancer before transplantation. Altogether, our final analytic cohort
included 178 785 transplant episodes occurring in 165 734
individuals, 1617 NHL, and 48 HL cases.
Statistical analysis. For each lymphoma subtype, we measured the
risk in transplant recipients relative to the general population using
the standardised incidence ratio (SIR, i.e., observed/expected
number of cases). Observed numbers were derived from the
cancer registry linkages, as described above. Expected numbers
were calculated by applying general population cancer incidence
rates obtained from each cancer registry to person-time at risk
among transplant recipients, stratified by sex, 5-year age group,
race/ethnicity, and calendar year. Rates for whites, blacks, and
Asians/Pacific Islanders were derived from participating registries.
Rates for Hispanics (available 1992 onward) were derived from the
US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programme, in
which 8 of the 14 contributing cancer registries participate.
The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around each SIR were derived
assuming that the observed counts follow a Poisson distribution.
We also calculated SIRs and 95% CIs across categories defined
by age at transplant, transplanted organ, and successive
time intervals (1–360 days, 361–1800 days, and 1801 þ days)
after transplant. Univariate Poisson regression models were created
for each subtype and used to test for heterogeneity across these
categories.
In sensitivity analyses we (1) excluded all transplants for which
the reported NHL was not the first haematologic malignancy
reported, and (2) excluded transplants for which there was a gap
between date of transplant and the beginning of cancer registry
coverage. Results from these sensitivity analyses were similar to
those from our main analysis and thus are not presented here. All
CIs and statistical tests were two sided.
RESULTS
We evaluated 178 785 solid organ transplants in 165 734 individuals,
with 791 281 person-years of follow-up. Table 1 describes the
demographic characteristics of individuals who received these
transplants. Of the transplant recipients, 61% were male, and the
median age at transplant was 47.0 years, with a quarter of patients
under age 35 years at the time of transplant. Recipients were racially

and ethnically diverse, with almost 40% of patients being non-white.
Kidney transplants were most common, but 41% of transplants were
of other organs, and 91% were first transplants.
Through matches with cancer registry records, 1617 NHL
diagnoses and 48 HL diagnoses among transplant recipients were
identified. Of the NHLs, specific histologic subtype was reported
for 1285 (80%). Compared with cases with specified subtypes,
NHLs for which histologic subtype was not reported (i.e., ‘NHL,
not otherwise specified’) were similar in terms of age, sex, and
organ transplanted, but were significantly (Po0.05) more likely to
have disease limited to lymph nodes (i.e., nodal) and to have been
diagnosed in the earlier years of the study (e.g., 1987–1994).
Overall, transplant recipients had over six-fold increased risk of
developing any kind of NHL compared with the general population
(SIR ¼ 6.2, 95% CI: 5.9–6.5). Table 2 describes the risk for 19
defined distinct NHL subtypes. Among NHLs for which specific
subtypes were reported, 85.5% were B-cell lymphomas and 6.2%
were T-cell lymphomas. The NHL subtype with the highest
elevation in risk was hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, an
uncommon NHL subtype for which the risk was elevated 100-
fold (SIR ¼ 100, 95% CI: 33–234) above the general population.
However, this increase was based on only six cases and an
incidence rate of less than one per 100 000 person-years. The most
common subtype diagnosed was DLBCL, which comprised almost
two-thirds of all post-transplant NHLs with specified subtype, and
for which the risk was over 13 times higher than in the general
population (SIR ¼ 13.5, 95% CI: 12.7–14.4). After DLBCL, the next
most commonly diagnosed subtype was Burkitt’s lymphoma,
for which the risk was B25 times elevated (SIR ¼ 24.5, 95%
CI: 19.6–30.2). Other B-cell lymphomas with significantly elevated
risks included lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (SIR ¼ 2.8, 95%
CI: 1.6–4.5) and marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT; SIR ¼ 2.8, 95% CI: 1.9–4.0). The risk of
developing HL was significantly elevated 3.6-fold (SIR ¼ 3.6, 95%
CI: 2.9–4.4) compared with the general population.
When T-cell lymphomas were considered as a single entity, the
risk was seven-fold higher than in the general population
(SIR ¼ 7.1, 95% CI: 5.6–8.9; Table 2). Peripheral T-cell lymphomas
and anaplastic large-cell lymphomas comprised over 80% of the
T-cell lymphomas, with other subtypes occurring rarely.
Among the T-cell lymphomas, the greatest risk elevation was for
hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (SIR ¼ 100, as noted above).
Other T-cell lymphomas with elevated risks included extranodal
natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas, nasal type (SIR ¼ 15.0, 95%
CI: 6.5–29.6), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (SIR ¼ 12.8, 95% CI:
9.0–17.7), primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
(SIR ¼ 13.5, 95% CI: 6.2–25.5), and other peripheral T-cell
lymphomas (SIR ¼ 3.9, 95% CI: 2.7–5).
Among other specified NHLs, the risk was also elevated for
precursor B- or T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma,
compared with the general population (SIR ¼ 2.0, 95%
CI: 1.23–3.20). In sharp contrast, few cases and no significant
elevations in risk were observed for follicular lymphoma,
small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
(CLL/SLL), mantle cell lymphoma, or mycosis fungoides/Se´zary’s
syndrome.
The risks differed substantially according to the age at
transplant, with a strong inverse relationship between SIRs and
age demonstrated for several NHL subtypes and HL (Table 3).
Among recipients aged o20 years at the time of trans￾plantation, the risks were strikingly elevated for Burkitt’s
lymphoma (SIR ¼ 123, 95% CI: 79.0–183), DLBCL (SIR ¼ 379,
95% CI: 318–447), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (SIR ¼ 172, 95%
CI: 69.1–354), and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (SIR ¼ 96.9,
95% CI: 41.8–191). For many subtypes, it was difficult to assess
gradients in risk by age because there were fewer than three cases
diagnosed among those aged o20 years at transplant. Notably,
however, the risks for most subtypes among individuals aged Z50
years at the time of transplantation remained elevated compared
with the general population.
Table 4 shows that for some subtypes, the patterns of risk also
differed with respect to time since transplant, although for other
subtypes, the numbers were small and differences were not
significant. The SIRs for DLBCL and anaplastic large-cell
lymphoma showed a U-shaped pattern, with risks highest in the
first year after transplant, lower at 361–1800 days after transplant,
and slightly higher again 1801 þ days after transplant. In contrast,
SIRs for HL, Burkitt’s lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphomas,
and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma were not statistically signi￾ficantly elevated in the first year after transplant but increased
subsequently, with markedly elevated relative risk observed 1801 þ
days after transplant.
The risk of lymphoma subtypes differed by the type of organ
transplanted (Table 5). For most subtypes, kidney recipients had
lower SIRs than liver or thoracic organ (heart and/or lung)
recipients (although still elevated compared with the general
population in many instances). However, the number of cases for
many subtypes was small, and risk did not differ significantly by
organ. The risks for DLBCL and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
were highest among pancreas and kidney/pancreas recipients,
whereas Burkitt’s lymphoma risk was highest among liver and

thoracic organ recipients. None of the recipients who developed
hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma received a liver transplant, rather,
four of the six recipients received kidneys.
The patterns for NHL overall according to age, organ type, and
time since transplant generally mirrored those observed for
DLBCL, the most common subtype (Tables 3–5). Similarly, the
patterns of risk of unclassified lymphoma (NHL, not otherwise
specified) were also similar to those observed for DLBCL.
DISCUSSION
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is among the most common malig￾nancies diagnosed among solid organ transplant recipients.
Overall, the risk for NHL is six-fold higher following transplanta￾tion than in the general population, but in this large, population￾based study we demonstrate that the risks vary dramatically
by lymphoma subtype. Elevated risks were particularly striking
(410-fold) for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, Burkitt’s
lymphoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal type, DLBCL,
and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (both systemic and primary
cutaneous forms). For DLBCL and Burkitt’s lymphoma, which
were the most common lymphoma subtypes after transplant, the
relative risks were most strongly pronounced among transplant
patients under age 20 years, and differed according to the type
of organ transplanted. We also observed moderately elevated
risks (i.e., 2- to 3-fold higher than the general population) for HL,
lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, precursor B- or T-cell lympho￾blastic leukaemia/lymphoma, other T-cell lymphomas, and
marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type, whereas the risks were
not increased for follicular or mantle cell lymphomas, CLL/SLL, or
mycosis fungoides/Se´zary’s syndrome.
The mechanisms explaining the different spectrum of
lymphoma subtypes among transplant patients compared with
the general population include immunosuppression, including the
early, intense induction phase and the later maintenance phase;
chronic immune activation because of the presence of donor organ
tissue; or the combined effects of these, resulting in long-term,
chronic immune dysfunction. The lymphoma subtypes for which
the risk is elevated are similar to those that are increased in
HIV-infected patients (Mbulaiteye et al, 2003; Biggar et al, 2007;

Engels et al, 2008; Vajdic et al, 2010), another population
experiencing both chronic immunosuppression and immune
activation. Investigators in the United States and Australia have
demonstrated especially elevated risks among HIV-infected
individuals for ‘high-grade’ NHL subtypes as a group (SIR B50–
110) and for DLBCL (SIRs 25–100), Burkitt’s lymphoma (SIRs 50–
140), and T-cell lymphomas (SIR B15) (Mbulaiteye et al, 2003;
Engels et al, 2006; van Leeuwen et al, 2009; Vajdic et al, 2010). In
contrast, follicular or ‘low-grade’ lymphoma risks were not higher
than in the general population in any of the transplant or HIV￾infected groups (Mbulaiteye et al, 2003; Quinlan et al, 2010; Vajdic
et al, 2010). The overall relative risks observed here are lower than
those observed in HIV-infected populations, perhaps because of
the different pattern of immunosuppression or the different type of
immune stimulus conferred by a donor organ than associated with
HIV infection.
These data are informative with regard to several aspects of
lymphomagenesis for specific subtypes. For DLBCL, our observa￾tions are consistent with the known role of Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV)-driven B-cell expansion under conditions of intense
immunosuppression, especially in children. Epstein–Barr virus is
detected in the tumour cells of most transplant-related DLBCLs
(Carbone et al, 2009). We found that the risk of developing DLBCL
was concentrated in children (ages 0–19 years), and was highest in
the first year after transplant. These findings agree with previous
reports of transplant-related NHL overall and PTLD (Opelz et al,
2009; Vajdic and van Leeuwen, 2009) and are expected, given that
DLBCL comprises a large fraction of PTLD. Children are often
EBV seronegative at transplantation, which puts them at risk of
subsequent primary EBV infection and PTLD (Jenson, 2011;
Quinlan et al, 2011). For Burkitt’s lymphoma, which is also an
aggressive lymphoma, the risk was similarly highest in children,
but was not elevated in the first year after transplant and rose with
time since transplant. Of interest, only 40–60% of HIV-associated
Burkitt’s lymphoma is EBV related (Carbone et al, 2009). We were
unable to separate EBV-defined cases, and it is possible that the age
and latency patterns that we observed reflect mixed occurrence for
EBV-positive and -negative forms of Burkitt’s lymphoma after
transplant (Carbone et al, 2009). Transplant-related cases of HL
are also commonly EBV positive (Bierman et al, 1996; Knight et al,
2009), and in our study, HL risk also increased with time since
transplant.
We also observed statistically significantly elevated risks of
marginal zone lymphomas of MALT type and lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma, although the magnitudes of elevation were lower than
those for DLBCL and Burkitt’s lymphoma. Outside of the
transplant setting, these subtypes are thought to arise under
conditions of persistent immune stimulation by chronic microbial
infections (e.g., Helicobacter pylori for gastric MALT type
lymphoma, hepatitis C virus for lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma)
(Engels, 2007; Giordano et al, 2007; de Sanjose et al, 2008).
Transplant-related immunosuppression may increase microbial
activity or modulate the immune response against these micro￾organisms. In contrast, for other indolent B-cell lymphomas such
as follicular lymphoma and CLL/SLL, our data are not suggestive of
major roles for the types of immunosuppression, immune

activation, or other immune disturbances experienced by trans￾plant recipients.
Although T-cell lymphomas constituted a small proportion of
NHLs in this transplant population, we observed very high relative
risks of certain T-cell subtypes, including hepatosplenic T-cell
lymphoma and both systemic and primary cutaneous anaplastic
large-cell lymphomas. For anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, relative
risks were markedly elevated in the first year after transplant. Of
interest, EBV is not generally thought to play an important role in
the aetiology of T-cell PTLD (Engels, 2007). Although the
exceedingly rare hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is well recognised
as a type of PTLD, EBV is infrequently detected in tumour cells of
this malignancy (Engels, 2007). The very high relative risks of
hepatosplenic T-cell and anaplastic large-cell lymphomas observed
here after transplant, but not in HIV-infected individuals
(Opelz and Dohler, 2004; LaCasce, 2006), may suggest that unique
aspects of transplant-associated immune disturbance are aetiolo￾gically important. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activity are
of interest because of the apparent association of hepatosplenic
T-cell lymphomas with use of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)
inhibitors for Crohn’s disease, arthritis, and other autoimmune
diseases (Hellgren et al, 2010; Deepak et al, 2013; Mason and
Siegel, 2013). It is also interesting that none of the hepatosplenic
T-cell lymphomas occurred in liver recipients, among whom the
donor organ provides a strong and sustained local immune
stimulus.
Our data also demonstrate substantial variation in the risk of
lymphoma subtypes according to age and time since transplant. In
general, SIRs for most lymphoma subtypes were elevated among
young transplant recipients. This pattern probably reflects the
contribution of primary EBV infection in younger recipients, as
well as a countervailing age-related rise in NHL incidence in the
general population due to other mechanisms. Although we
confirmed a U-shaped pattern in overall NHL risk over time, a
pattern previously observed by others (van Leeuwen et al, 2009;
Quinlan et al, 2011), we did not find a consistent pattern of risk
across all the specific subtypes. Intense, T cell-depleting induction
immunosuppressive agents used at the time of transplantation may
explain why the relative risks of DLBCL and systemic and
cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma were highest nearer the
time of transplant. In contrast, the relative risk of Burkitt’s
lymphoma increased with longer time since transplant. Among
older recipients and among recipients many years post transplant,
lymphoma occurrence may be caused by some combination of age￾related immune senescence, immunosuppression-related immune
dysfunction, and chronic antigenic stimulation from the trans￾planted graft or infection (Opelz and Dohler, 2004; Vajdic and van
Leeuwen, 2009; van Leeuwen et al, 2009).
Our analysis is the first to assess lymphoma subtype occurrence
by the type of organ transplanted. The relative risk of DLBCL was
substantially higher among pancreas and pancreas/kidney recipi￾ents than recipients of other organs, and Burkitt’s lymphoma risk
was highest among recipients of liver and thoracic organ (heart
and/or lung) transplants. Most prior studies of post-transplant
cancer risk have focussed on kidney recipients, but some have
reported higher risks of overall NHL for small intestine or lung
recipients than heart, liver, or kidney recipients (LaCasce, 2006;
Tsao and Hsi, 2007). In the Collaborative Transplant Study, PTLD

risk was substantially higher among heart/lung and lung recipients
than among other recipients (Opelz and Dohler, 2004). Variation
in the risk of DLBCL and other subtypes by organ type may relate
to differences in immunosuppressive regimens or the intensity of
immunosuppression. Along these lines, some studies have shown
that overall NHL risk is higher with certain induction immuno￾suppression agents, particularly monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody
(Bustami et al, 2004; Dharnidharka et al, 2012). Among HIV￾infected patients, the risk of DLBCL also has been shown to
correlate with the degree of immunosuppression as reflected by
CD4 count (Biggar et al, 2007). Alternatively, it is possible that
different transplanted organs confer different levels of chronic
antigen stimulation relevant to lymphomagenesis.
Although DLBCL is the most commonly diagnosed B-cell
malignancy in the general population, it represents only 25–30% of
all NHL cases (Morton et al, 2006), whereas it comprises over half
of all transplant-related NHLs. Follicular lymphoma and CLL/SLL
each comprise B15–20% of NHLs diagnosed in the general
population, but o3% of NHL cases in our transplant cohort.
Notably, transplant recipients thus have higher proportions of
aggressive subtypes and lower proportions of indolent B-cell
lymphomas. Because many of the subtypes with elevated risk are
rare in the general population, our results underscore the
importance of expert haematopathologic workup of suspicious
lymphoproliferations among transplant patients (Jagadeesh et al,
2012) and, moreover, suggest a specific range of lymphoma
subtypes as differential diagnoses among such patients. Correct
diagnosis of subtype is important for management of post￾transplant lymphoma, most importantly for planning therapeutic
regimen, which varies substantially by specific lymphoma subtype.
This study has several important strengths. It is the first cohort
study of transplant recipients to have a large enough number of
incident lymphoma cases to allow assessing risks separately for a
wide spectrum of subtypes. Prior efforts to quantify these risks
have been limited by lack of data on lymphoma subtypes, or small
size and restriction to special subgroups of transplant patients, for
example, kidney recipients (Vajdic et al, 2010) or Medicare
beneficiaries over age 65 years (Quinlan et al, 2010). Our cohort
included a well-defined, population-based sample of the US
transplant population, and linkage with corresponding popula￾tion-based cancer registries allowed for highly complete, uniform
cancer ascertainment.
Among the study’s limitations, we note that lymphoma subtype
classifications were derived from cancer registry abstractions of
medical records, which may not have been standard and may have
been affected by changes in lymphoma diagnostic practice over
time. Our prior studies of cancer registry classification of
lymphoma subtypes suggest good reliability for some subtypes
(e.g., DLBCL, follicular lymphoma) (Clarke et al, 2004, 2006).
However, misclassification would be more likely for less common

NHL subtypes and for cases diagnosed in the earlier years of this
study before widespread dissemination of the international
consensus guidelines (Clarke et al, 2004, 2006). In addition, we
could not examine risks across the full spectrum of PTLDs, because
US cancer registries collect information only for cases deemed
malignant by a pathologist. Despite the large number of NHL
cases, we did not have adequate numbers of rare subtypes,
including most T-cell lymphomas, to reliably assess risk according
to age or time since transplant. We note that our estimated risk for
overall NHL included CLL, which is now understood to be the
same entity as SLL (Turner et al, 2010). Inclusion of CLL/SLL
decreased the SIR for overall NHL, which affects comparisons with
previous reports (Kasiske et al, 2004; Caillard et al, 2006; Vajdic
et al, 2006; Giordano et al, 2007; Serraino et al, 2007; Jiang et al,

hence we could not separately examine the risk for EBV-defined
lymphoma subtypes.
In conclusion, we found substantial differences in the risk for
individual lymphoma subtypes and varying patterns in association
with age, transplanted organ, and time since transplantation. These
results highlight that NHL should not be considered a single entity
in studies of lymphoid malignancy or PTLD after transplant. There
is a characteristic clinical spectrum of NHL subtypes among
transplant recipients. Because lymphoma treatment varies by
subtype, patients suspected of having lymphoma should receive a
detailed haematopathologic workup. Our findings also provide new
insight into the importance of immunosuppression for the
development of some lymphoma subtypes. Future research will
require large and representative case series with detailed pathologic
classification to untangle the complex effects of host characteristics,
oncogenic viral infections, iatrogenic immunosuppression, chronic
antigen stimulation, and age-related immune senescence on
development of NHL.
