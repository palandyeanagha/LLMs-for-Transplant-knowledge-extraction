Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
This review integrates various aspects of relationship between alpha-1-antitrypsin and hepatocellular carcinoma in adults, with 
emphasis on the epidemiology and molecular pathogenesis. Recognizing the complexity of this association could contribute to 
understand the role of alpha-1-antitrypsin in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Context: Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is the most abundant liver-derived, highly polymor￾phic, glycoprotein in plasma. Hereditary deficiency of alpha-1-antitrypsin in plasma 
(A1ATD) is a consequence of accumulation of polymers of A1AT mutants in endoplasmic 
reticulum of hepatocytes and other A1AT-producing cells. One of the clinical manifes￾tations of A1ATD is liver disease in childhood and cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carci￾noma (HCC) in adulthood. Epidemiology and pathophysiology of liver failure in early 
childhood caused by A1ATD are well known, but the association with hepatocellular car￾cinoma is not clarified. The aim of this article is to review different aspects of association 
between A1AT variants and hepatocellular carcinoma, with emphasis on the epidemiol￾ogy and molecular pathogenesis. The significance of A1AT as a biomarker in the diagno￾sis of HCC is also discussed.
Evidence Acquisitions: Search for relevant articles were performed through Pub Med, 
HighWire, and Science Direct using the keywords “alpha-1-antitrypsin”, “liver diseases”, 
“hepatocellular carcinoma”, “SERPINA1”. Articles published until 2011 were reviewed.
Results: Epidemiology studies revealed that severe A1ATD is a significant risk factor for 
cirrhosis and HCC unrelated to the presence of HBV or HCV infections. However, predis￾position to HCC in moderate A1ATD is rare, and probably happens in combination with 
HBV and/or HCV infections or other unknown risk factors. It is assumed that accumu￾lation of polymers of A1ATD variants in endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes leads to 
damage of hepatocytes by gain-of-function mechanism. Also, increased level of A1AT was 
recognized as diagnostic and prognostic marker of HCC.
Conclusions: Clarification of a carcinogenic role for A1ATD and identification of pro￾inflammatory or some still unknown factors that lead to increased susceptibility to HCC 
associated with A1ATD may contribute to a better understanding of hepatic carcinogen￾esis and to the development of new drugs. Published by Kowsar Corp, 2012. cc 3.0.

Topic A et al. Alpha-1-Antitrypsin in Pathogenesis
1. Context 
Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is the most abundant liver￾derived glycoprotein in plasma and predominant circula￾tory protease inhibitor. It is also an acute phase reactant 
and its plasma concentrations increase three to five-fold 
during the host response to inflammation/tissue injury. 
A1AT is the archetype member of the SERPIN (SERine Pro￾teinase INhibitor) super family of structurally related 
proteins, which have remarkable structural homology 
characterized by a dominant A β-sheet and a mobile reac￾tive center loop that presents a peptide sequence as the 
pseudosubstrate for the target proteinase (1). According to 
the serpin nomenclature it has been marked as SERPINA1 
(serine proteinase inhibitor, clade A, member 1). The hepa￾tocytes are the main source of A1AT, and the SERPINA1 gene 
is under control of different cytokines, such as interleu￾kin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factors α (TNFα), and the most 
effective interleukin-6 family of cytokines (interleukin-6, 
leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M) (2). The SER￾PINA1 gene is located on the protease inhibitor (Pi) locus, 
on the long arm of chromosome 14, mapped to 14q31–32, 
and shows a co-dominant pattern of inheritance (3). Fol￾lowing maturation, A1AT is secreted into the circulation as 
a 52-kD single-chain glycoprotein composed of 394 amino 
acid residues and 3 asparagine-linked complex carbohy￾drate side chains. The internal structure of A1AT is highly 
ordered, with nine α-helices (A→I) and three β-sheets. One 
of the most striking features of the serpins, including A1AT, 
is their dramatic conformational rearrangement during 
the inhibition of target proteinase. Upon binding of target 
proteinase, reactive center of the proteinase is cleaved and 
proteinase is transferred to other end of the serpin mol￾ecule. This conformational change is required for a serpin 
to function as a proteinase inhibitor, but can also be detri￾mental because point mutations facilitate the sequential 
insertion of the reactive site loop into a β-sheet of another 
molecule, thereby leading to formation of polymers. 
The Pi locus is highly polymorphic and the most com￾mon alleles of A1AT are M1 (Ala213), M1 (Val213), M2 and M3, 
which have a normal serum level (1.5-3.5 g/L) and ability to 
inhibit target proteinases. Despite a great number of A1AT 
variants, only a few are clinically relevant, and assigned as 
deficient A1AT variants (A1ATD). Deficiency of A1AT is the 
most common genetic cause of early-onset panlobular 
emphysema, liver disease in childhood, and can also man￾ifest with cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma in 
adulthood. Some of the deficient variants accumulate in 
intracellular endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and 
other A1AT-producing cells and therefore are inefficiently 
secreted. Several point mutations of A1AT are known to 
cause a perturbation in protein structure with conse￾quent polymerization and intracellular accumulation. 
Mutations responsible for the molecular instability of the 
protein occur in the hinges and sliding regions involved 
in the movement of reactive loop to other end of molecule 
(4). The effect of these mutations allows spontaneous 
opening of the main β sheet of the molecule which results 
in rapid insertion into the sheet of the reactive loop of 
the next molecule and formation of loop-sheet polymers. 
Protein aggregation in the liver occur in patients homo￾zygous for most common mutated variant - Z (5, 6) and 
two other rare variants - Siiyama (7) and Mmalton (8, 9). 
Histological hallmark of liver disease in A1AT deficiency 
is the presence of A1AT-containing globules positive to 
diastase-resistant periodic acid-Schiff (PAS-D) staining in 
some, but not all hepatocytes. Link between A1AT and liver 
malignancy has been investigated from several aspects, 
mainly by association of A1AT polymorphisms, elevation 
of serum levels, and changes in oligosaccharide content of 
A1AT with different liver disease, from cirrhosis to hepato￾cellular carcinoma (HCC). 
2. Evidence Acquisition
Search for relevant articles were performed through Pub 
Med, HighWire, and Science Direct using the keywords 
“alpha-1-antitrypsin”, “liver diseases”, “hepatocellular carci￾noma”, and “SERPINA1”. Articles published until 2011 were 
reviewed.
3. Results
3.1. Liver Disease Epidemiology and Polymorphism of A1AT in 
Adulthood 
Epidemiological evidence and clinical features of liver 
disease in adult-carriers of A1ATD show marked variability 
in phenotypic expression of liver disease among affected 
PiZZ homozygotes. Relatively little is known about the fac￾tors that predispose subpopulation of PiZZ individuals to 
liver disease and/or protect remainder of the PiZZ popula￾tion from liver disease (10, 11). Furthermore, cirrhosis in 
adult A1ATD Z-allele carriers can occur without preceding 
history of childhood liver disease (12). Variations in onset 
and severity of liver disease suggest that genetic and en￾vironmental modifiers have dramatic effects on clinical 
manifestations of liver disease. A prospective Swedish 
study showed that only approximately 10% of PiZZ and PiSZ 
26-year-old subjects had marginal deviations in liver test 
results (13). Generally, A1ATD adults show clinical manifes￾tations of chronic liver disease during middle or old age. 
Long-term observation (14) revealed slow progression of 
chronic liver disease in A1ATD adults. The mean ages of pa￾tients with advanced liver disease were 58, 66, and 73 years 
for PiZZ, PiSZ, and PiMZ phenotypes, respectively, and in 
40% of these patients the survival was less than two years 
(15). Two Swedish autopsy studies conducted on PiZZ pa￾tients revealed that over one third of elderly patients have 
developed cirrhosis and primary liver cancer (16, 17). 
Several studies have shown that PiMZ in heterozygous 
state may lead to chronic liver disease, cryptogenic cirrho￾sis, and chronic active hepatitis (18-20). However, in a large 
case-control study (21) no association was found between 

Hepat Mon. 2012;12(10 HCC): e7042 3
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin in Pathogenesis Topic A et al.
A1ATD heterozygotes and chronic liver disease, while high￾er prevalence of PiMZ in decompensated liver disease due 
to presence of HCV infection or non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease. Propst et al. (22) also observed the co-morbidity 
of viral infection and A1ATD with chronic liver disease in a 
cross-sectional study. Moreover, Eigenbrodt et al. (23) pro￾vided evidence of an association between Z heterozygosity 
and end stage liver diseases of several etiologies such as 
HCV infection, alcoholic liver disease, primary hepatic ma￾lignancy, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. In contrast, Bowlus et 
al. (24) found that male gender and obesity, but not alco￾hol or viral hepatitis, predispose advanced liver disease 
in adults with A1ATD. A recent study reported that S and 
Z A1AT variants are associated with hyperferritinemia and 
sinusoidal iron accumulation, but not with severe liver 
damage in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (25).
Case reports and family studies also reported associa￾tion between liver disease and some of rare A1AT variants 
such as Mduarte (26), S allele heterozygosity (27, 28), and 
M3 allele (29). In addition to cirrhosis, hepatocellular car￾cinoma is one of the possible complications that could 
occur in A1ATD adults with chronic liver disease. It is sug￾gested that risk for HCC in A1ATD individuals could not be 
fully attributed to cirrhosis, but rather could represent a 
downstream effect of A1AT intracellular retention and ac￾cumulation (30). Generally, A1ATD variants could be associ￾ated with HCC in two ways: as an independent genetic risk 
factor for HCC, or as a risk factor for hepatoviral infections 
that cause advanced liver disease and consequently hepa￾tocellular carcinoma. 
First data of association between A1ATD and HCC were 
obtained in the seventies of 20th century (31). Two Scandi￾navian studies revealed that PiZZ patients with cirrhosis 
over 50 years of age have a significant risk to develop HCC 
(16, 32). Specific A1AT immunoreactivity was identified in 
tumor cells, thus confirming an association between he￾patic deposition of A1AT and occurrence of primary liver 
carcinoma (33-35). Unique and important epidemiologic 
population-based retrospective study which collected 
data from all autopsies performed during 20-years in 
Malmö, Sweden demonstrated an overall increased risk 
of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer in PiZZ males (36). A 
case-control study conducted also in Malmö, Sweden, con￾firmed that PiZZ males are at greater risk of cirrhosis and 
HCC unrelated to the presence of HBV or HCV infections 
(37). Predisposition to HCC in PiMZ heterozygotes is rare, 
and probably happens in combination with HBV and/or 
HCV infections or other unknown risk factors. Propst et al.
(38) showed that A1ATD heterozygotes with cirrhosis have 
as high risk of developing HCC as those with other causes

of cirrhosis. Their research has shown high prevalence of 
viral infection in A1ATD-associated chronic liver disease 
leading to cirrhosis and furthermore to the development 
of HCC. Therefore, they recommended vaccination against 
HBV and when available against HCV infections. However, 
recent studies have shown that Z heterozygosity-associ￾ated HCC may develop in non-cirrhotic liver tissue, and 
frequently as cholangiocarcinoma (39, 40). In contrast, 
studies in different populations showed that association 
between A1ATD phenotypes and HCC is either non-existent 
or very weak (41-45). In a review article, Sherman (46) was 
concluded that there was insufficient data to determine 
whether screening for HCC might be beneficial for pa￾tients with cirrhosis caused by A1ATD. Several case-report 
studies have reported associations between A1ATD and 
HCC: a 16-year-old PiMZ boy with hepatocellular carcino￾ma (47); a PiMZ patient with hepatocellular carcinoma in a 
non-cirrhotic liver (48); and a primary liver cell carcinoma 
as a complication in a 67-year-old PiZZ patient (49). How￾ever, in the case of PiMZ patient with cirrhosis and hepato￾cellular carcinoma, histology revealed A1AT globules in he￾patocytes located at the periphery of the cirrhotic nodules, 
while they were sparse within neoplastic hepatocytes (50).
Association between non-A1ATD variants and HCC was 
also found in two studies which showed high prevalence 
of rare PiMF variant (41, 51).
3.2. Molecular Mechanism of Liver Injury in A1ATD 
Accumulation of polymers of A1ATD variants in endo￾plasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes leads to damage of 
hepatocytes by gain-of-function mechanism accompanied 
by plasma protein deficiency. Confirmation on gain-of￾toxic function as the mechanism by which accumulation 
of protein damages the cell comes from the observation 
that in mice transgenic for Z mutant of human A1AT (A1AT￾Z) gene hepatic inflammation and carcinoma developed 
(52). As these mice had normal levels of endogenous anti￾proteinases, the liver disease was attributable to a gain-of￾toxic function mechanism. Transgenic young A1AT-Z mice 
expressing higher serum levels of A1AT were more likely 
to develop tumors with age than those with lower levels 
of A1AT (53). This study also showed that accumulation of 
A1AT-Z altered regulation of several genes, including cyclin 
D1 and MCAM, which lead to cell proliferation and tumori￾genesis.
Study of genetically engineered skin fibroblast cell lines 
from PiZZ individuals with or without liver disease indi￾cated that there was a lag in ER degradation of A1AT-Z (54). 
Moreover inefficient degradation of A1AT-Z in the ER was 
in correlation with susceptibility to liver disease. These 
results suggested that modifiers of the disease affect the 
pathways responsible for disposal of A1AT-Z and thereby 
attention of researchers was directed toward these path￾ways. Two explanations for the effects of such modifiers 
have been postulated: variation in the function of intracel￾lular degradation mechanisms and/or variation in signal 
transduction pathways activated to protect the cell from 
protein mislocalization and/or aggregation (55). Expres￾sion of mutant proteins disrupts protein folding in the ER 
and causes cellular response known as ER stress. Terminal￾ly misfolded proteins are selectively transported from the 
ER into the cytosol, and are subsequently ubiquinated and 
degraded by proteasome in a process called ER-associated 
degradation (ERAD). In the absence of efficient protein 
degradation, or if accumulation of misfolded proteins 
in the ER overwhelms degradation machinery, several ER 
response pathways can be activated. Unfolded protein 
response (UPR) is a signal transduction pathway that acti￾vates a wide spectrum of genes in response to accumula￾tion of unfolded, misfolded, or unassembled proteins in 
the ER and decrease translation initiation in such a way 
that only specific mRNAs can be translated. 
Signs of the unfolded protein response were found nei￾ther in A1AT-Z stable transfected cell line, nor in transgenic 
mice (10). Using HeLa and murine hepatoma cell lines as a 
model and investigating synthesis of BiP and CHOP (UPR 
targets) showed that accumulation of A1AT-Z in the ER did 
not activate UPR. Expression of A1ATSaar variant (carboxyl 
terminal tail is truncated) which is retained in ER but does 
not form polymers was found to induce UPR, suggesting 
that the lack of activation of UPR by ER retention of A1AT-Z 
protein somehow influences propensity of A1AT-Z to form 
insoluble polymers in ER. On the other hand, work from 
Carroll et al., indicates that UPR is activated by A1AT-Z in hu￾man peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that species￾and cell-specific differences may exist (56). 
There are at least two pathways for degradation of Z 
variant that accumulates in ER: proteasomal degradation 
pathway and autophagy. While proteasome is responsible 
for degrading soluble forms of Z variant (57), autophagy 
is specialized for disposal of insoluble polymers and ag￾gregates. Experiments with yeast A1AT-Z expression sys￾tem discovered that, at low levels of expression, A1AT-Z 
remained mainly soluble and could be handled by ERAD 
pathway. In contrast, higher levels of A1AT-Z resulted in for￾mation of polymers and a functional autophagic pathway 
was required for degradation and cell viability (58). As a 
result, triggering autophagy induction by A1AT-Z might be 
caused by formation of polymers. Results of two studies by 
Teckmann et al. (11, 59) indicate that retention of A1AT-Z in 
ER is associated with a marked autophagic response. Using 
genetically engineered A1AT-Z mouse as an in vivo model, 
and fasting as an environmental stressor, they showed that 
autophagy is constitutively activated and that fasting does 
not lead to an increase in autophagosomes in the liver of 
PiZ mouse. A hypothesis proposed by the authors implicat￾ing that autophagic response exhibits a protective role by 
clearing ER with aggregated mutant A1AT-Z molecules and 
that protective mechanism of A1AT-Z liver is very weak and 
would probably be easily overwhelmed by physiological 
and pathological stressors. 
Mitochondrial autophagy and mitochondrial injury are 

Hepat Mon. 2012;12(10 HCC): e7042 5
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin in Pathogenesis Topic A et al.
also present in the liver in A1AT deficiency, which provides 
evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in liv￾er cell injury mechanism in A1AT deficiency (60, 61). Since 
autophagic response participates in both degradation of 
A1AT-Z and in cellular response to accumulation of A1AT-Z 
in ER, drugs enhancing autophagy, such as carbamazepine, 
could be potentially used to prevent hapatotoxicity due to 
A1AT deficiency (55). Accumulation of aggregation prone 
to A1AT variants in ER may potentially induce multiple sig￾naling events related to ER stress. Given the heterogeneity 
of liver disease in A1AT deficiency, it can be hypothesized 
that clinically significant liver damage occurs only in A1AT￾deficient patients who also have some other defect in ER 
quality control and that these defects are heterogeneous 
among the affected population. Considering previously 
mentioned studies, the possible mechanisms responsible 
for hepatocellular carcinoma in A1ATD are shown in Figure 
1.
Whereas relatively little is known about the pathogen￾esis of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with A1ATD, 
future research will provide answers to many unresolved 
issues. A detailed elucidation of the mechanisms by which 
aggregated A1AT Z is degraded in ER is essential to under￾stand how the quality control of ER works in general, and 
to recognize the specific issue of how a subgroup of A1AT 
deficient individuals becomes susceptible to liver injury 
and carcinogenesis. 
3.3. A1AT as Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Elevated level of A1AT is suggested as cancer marker that 
discriminates cancer from chronic benign diseases, and 
clinical remission from relapse (62). A recent study (63) 
using proteomics identified that A1AT, along with 50 other 
proteins, showed marked difference between the HCC tis￾sue samples and pre-cancerous lesions, suggesting that 
alterations in protein expression occurred frequently dur￾ing the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. Increased level of 
A1AT was recognized as a diagnostic and prognostic mark￾er of HCC (64, 65). Serum A1AT level in patients with HCC 
was significantly higher than those in patients with liver 
cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis (66). The exact mechanism 
and role of elevated serum level of A1AT in HCC is still un￾clear. Results of the study by Sawaya et al. (67) supported 
a hypotheses that production of A1AT by tumor cells cor￾relates with the regional proteolytic and inflammatory 
activity, which are probably involved in the protection of 
tumor cells. 
In addition, a few studies indicated that serum levels of 
A1AT represent an important survival prognostic factor 
among patients with HCC. Increased levels of serum A1AT 
in HCC patients are in correlation with shorter survival, 
and a difference of serum A1AT of 0.02 g/L correlates with 
25% shorter expected survival time , while a difference of 
0.04 g/L implies more than 40% decrease in survival time 
(68). Similar results showed that HCC patients with A1AT 
levels > 2.20 g/L had significantly decreased median sur￾vival than patients with A1AT levels ≤ 2.20 g/L (69), suggest￾ing that A1AT level is an independent predictor of survival. 
In effort to found more sensitive and specific tumor 
marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, the levels of A1AT 
and levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were combined. 
These combined levels were found to be more sensitive 
and more specific tumor marker for hepatocellular carci￾noma, than separate A1AT and AFP levels. The sensitivity 
to HCC using only AFP (> 400 ng/mL) or only A1AT level 
(> 3.2 g/L) were 52% and 76%, respectively while combined 
test sensitivity was improved to 80% (70). Changes in glyco￾sylation of proteins, most notably fucosylation, have been 
associated with the development of hepatocellular carci￾noma (71). It has been reported that elevated concentra￾tion of fucose acid was in strong positive correlation with 
serum level of A1AT, and was a measure of tumor spread 
(72, 73). Furthermore, human hepatoma cell line PLC/PRF/5 
synthesized and secreted a functional A1AT with normal 
molecular size but with atypical, highly branched and in￾completely sialylated carbohydrate chains (74). 
Wang et al. (75) in searching for a reliable biomarker for 
early detection of HCC found that the level of fucosylated 
A1AT in combination with fucosylated kininogen, level of 
α-fetoprotein, and Golgi protein 73 (GP73) gives sensitiv￾ity of 95% and specificity of 70% in diagnosis HCC. A very 
recent study (76) reported in details the stepwise changes 
in glycosylation of A1AT progressing from liver cirrhosis to 
cancer and identified a core fucosylation on A1AT as a HCC 
specific modification.
4. Conclusions
To date, research on the role of alpha-1-antitrypsin in 
the ethiology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular cancer 
could be summarized in the following facts. This protein is 
useful diagnostic and prognostic marker of HCC, in quali￾tative (fucosylated A1AT) and quantitative sense (increased 
serum levels). On the other hand, epidemiological studies 
have shown an association between A1ATD and HCC. At 
first sight, the facts that both high levels and deficiency 
of the A1ATD are associated with HCC could be contradic￾tory. However, A1ATD variants are normally synthesized, 
but they are trapped in endoplasmic reticulum of hepa￾tocytes leading to hepatocyte damage by gain-of-function 
mechanism followed by plasma deficiency of the protein. 
In contrast, increased levels of serum A1AT in HCC patients 
are in correlation with shorter survival. The possible expla￾nation is that elevated production of A1AT by tumor cells is 
involved in their protection. 
Future investigations should clarify a role for A1ATD in 
carcinogenesis and identify pro-inflammatory or some 
still unknown factors that lead to increased susceptibility 
to HCC associated with A1ATD. Identifying these mecha￾nisms will contribute to a better understanding of hepatic 
carcinogenesis, as well as to develop possible preventive 
measures.
