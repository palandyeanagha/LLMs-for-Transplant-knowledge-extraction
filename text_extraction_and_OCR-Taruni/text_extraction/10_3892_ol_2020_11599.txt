Abstract. COVID‑19 has caused unprecedented societal 
turmoil, triggering a rapid, still ongoing, transformation of 
healthcare provision on a global level. In this new landscape, 
it is highly important to acknowledge the challenges this 
pandemic poses on the care of the particularly vulnerable 
cancer patients and the subsequent psychosocial impact on 
them. We have outlined our clinical experience in managing 
patients with gastrointestinal, hematological, gynaecological, 
dermatological, neurological, thyroid, lung and paediatric 
cancers in the COVID‑19 era and have reviewed the emerging 
literature around barriers to care of oncology patients and 
how this crisis affects them. Moreover, evolving treatment 
strategies and novel ways of addressing the needs of oncology 
patients in the new context of the pandemic are discussed.

442 tsamakis et al: Psychosocial impact of COVId-19 pandemic
caused a tremendous strain in healthcare services (2), affecting 
directly and indirectly the course and treatment of many 
common illnesses (3). Oncology patients have been particu￾larly affected, since they are regarded a highly vulnerable 
group in the current pandemic, due to their immunocompro￾mised status caused by both cancer and various anticancer 
treatments (4,5). Data from China and Italy show that the case 
fatality (defined as the number of deaths in COVID‑19 posi￾tive patients, divided by the number of those tested positive) is 
significantly higher in patients with cancer than those without
(6 vs. 2%) (6,7). In addition, two recent studies demonstrated 
that patients with cancer are at an increased risk of more 
severe infection and subsequent complications, particularly 
if surgery or chemotherapy are performed within the month 
preceding SARS‑Cov‑2, while an underlying cancer diagnosis 
is associated with an increased risk of death and/or intensive 
care unit (ICU) admission (8,9).
Although the benefits of cancer therapies remain the same
in the current crisis, the risks have increased substantially, 
warranting careful reconsideration of clinical practices (10). 
As such, the COVID‑19 pandemic has significantly altered
cancer patient management (11) as evidenced by local (12), 
national (13), European (14) and American (15) guidelines or 
recommendations that have been recently published.
The present review explores the challenges to Oncology 
care that these new changes generate, and the subsequent 
psychosocial impact this has on cancer patients.
2. Oncology care in general
New realities. In this new landscape, the cancer community is 
steering a difficult course amid several challenges: revisiting
optimal standards of cancer care, facing persistently evolving 
shortages and acknowledging the paradoxical need to keep 
patients away from health care facilities. An ongoing chal￾lenge is balancing the risk of admission to the hospital with the 
possible risk of a SARS Cov 2 infection, which has an emotional 
impact not only on patients, but also on medical staff. Clinicians 
are under intense pressure and scrutiny during the COVID‑19 
pandemic, with oncology physicians particularly pressured, as 
they are facing several ethical dilemmas, as well as physical 
isolation from friends and family, increased risk of disease 
transmission, clinical challenges and competing demands (16).
Psychological impact on patients. Patients themselves have 
been deeply affected by the new realities; in particular by the 
knowledge of the higher risk of serious complications if infected 
by SARS‑Cov‑2 and the underlying fear of how the potential 
healthcare‑capacity issues will interfere with the optimal treat￾ment of their disease. COVID‑19 can trigger anxiety and distress, 
which may be of increased intensity in vulnerable patient groups, 
such as the oncology patients. Cancer patients feel isolated and 
can even experience emotions of guilt if their family provides 
help with daily living activities, which can be opposed to the 
recommended social distancing (26). Quarantine, a common 
reality during the COVID‑19 pandemic, may precipitate anxiety, 
irritability and depression, especially when implemented for 
prolonged periods(17). The social isolation and the need to ‘stay 
at home’ cause loneliness, which is associated with a higher risk 
of mortality in cancer patients(18,19). It is well documented that 
perceived uncertainty increases individual emotional distress, 
and this, in turn, has negative effects on clinical outcomes in 
cancer patients (20‑22).
Altering treatments and guidelines. Oncology societies and 
national authorities have been quick to issue guidelines on 
cancer care during the pandemic. The prioritization in the 
delivery of cancer therapies is strongly influenced by both 
the magnitude of potential treatment benefits and therapeutic
intent, while patient‑level factors such as age, comorbidities, and 
patient preferences have to be considered in the general frame￾work (23). Strategies such as reducing the number of clinical 
visits, shortening radiotherapy fractionation, converting intra￾venous to oral systemic therapy, and even stopping or reducing 
the frequency of selected maintenance treatments have been 
implemented in most of the oncology clinics.
Addressing patients' needs. Addressing the concerns of 
patients poses another challenge to the oncology institutes. 
During this crisis, ensuring the well‑being of the patients and 
caregivers, providing a safe environment and effective and 
compassionate care are more important than ever. Patients have 
been encouraged to explore creative ways to cope with stress, 
including physical activity, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, 
mindful‑based strategies, avoiding overload of information 
and social connectedness. Additional support through mental 
health services should be available if the aforementioned 
measures are not sufficient. Virtual community and patient
support groups can be excellent sources of encouragement and 
support, both for oncology patients and their caregivers (24).
Communication, remote care and e‑Health. In this turmoil, 
better and efficient communication between oncologists and
their patients is of utmost priority. Telemedicine has been used 
by oncologists and patients with a positive experience in both 
groups(25,26). Although its effectiveness at reducing the spread 
of infection and improving outcomes is not yet proven (27), 
it increases access to care. Interacting with patients via tele￾medicine and providing useful advice both on somatic and 
mental matters could help avoid non‑essential admissions to 
hospital (28). Telemedicine is also used by onco‑psychologists 
and onco‑psychiatrists to guarantee psychological support for 
individual patients, while limiting visits to the cancer institute.
In response to cancer patients' increased need of efficient
and helpful communication, also highlighted by cancer patient 
groups, the websites of most cancer institutes have added a 
regularly updated question‑and‑answer COVID‑19 section, 
whilst social media campaigns and press releases offer addi￾tional channels to reach out to patients. In particular, the use 
of social media could help overcome certain barriers posed 
by the COVID‑19 pandemic, as previous experience in cancer 
patients shows that social media use had a positive impact 
on psychosocial health outcomes, e.g., larger social support 
networks were associated with better prognosis after breast 
cancer treatment. More specifically, a study by Shim et al
found that those who disclosed personal insights about breast 
cancer in an online support group experienced higher health 
self‑efficacy and emotional and functional well-being (29),
while users of a Twitter breast cancer support group also 
reported decreased anxiety after tweet chats (30).

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 20: 441-447, 2020 443
Additional virtual care tools, such as webinars, can also be 
used to support patients. Although synchronous (e.g., ‘Zoom 
groups’) and asynchronous (e.g., Facebook) cancer specific
groups may be viable options, it is essential to consider issues 
of privacy and credibility of information shared. The rapid 
need for implementation of virtual care during the COVID‑19 
pandemic will necessitate further research to help improve our 
understanding of e‑Health effectiveness in cancer patients.
3. Challenges in managing specific types of cancers
Haematological cancer patients. COVID‑19 is expected to be 
a devastating infection in many patients with solid tumours and 
hematologic malignancies due to older age, comorbidities and 
immunocompromised status and therefore should be managed 
appropriately without jeopardizing the curative chance of these 
patients. In the COVID‑19 oncology era, difficult clinical deci￾sions regarding delay or initiation of chemotherapy need to be 
carefully evaluated. Adjuvant therapy with curative objective 
should proceed during the pandemic, while for metastatic 
disease, any delays might lead to further progression and 
ineligibility for further treatment (31). The American Society of 
Clinical Oncology recommends rescheduling routine follow‑up 
visits of patients that are not currently receiving treatment. 
Home collection of lab samples should be considered to avoid 
additional visits to the clinic (32). If possible, it is considered 
reasonable to delay highly immunosuppressive treatment 
strategies such as allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplan￾tation (33). Chemotherapy protocols are being revised in order 
to minimize frequency of visits and depth of immunosuppres￾sion. Oral regimens should be preferred, especially for elderly 
and frail patients. Watchful waiting should be considered for 
patients with asymptomatic and slow progressions.
Another challenge is that patients under cytoreductive treat￾ment or immunotherapy, as well as patients with lung cancer 
or metastatic lesions, might present with symptoms similar to 
COVID‑19, either due to other infectious diseases or to the 
underlying malignancy. Therefore, it is of utmost importance 
to educate cancer patients accordingly and evaluate them in the 
most appropriate way. Patients need to be informed regarding 
the symptoms of COVID‑19, trained in proper hand washing 
hygiene and guided on using personal protective equipment 
whenever they go out in public places or the hospital.
Neurological cancer patients. Apart from social isolation and 
physical distancing resulting in anxiety and distress, the quality 
of life of patients with brain tumors, who often have to travel to 
hospitals in endemic areas, is significantly affected by the fear
of facing this pandemic with an immune system that is signifi￾cantly weakened by their disease, steroids, radiotherapy or 
chemotherapy (34). Neuro‑oncologists and neurosurgeons not 
only face the ethical dilemma of treating their immunocompro￾mised patients at the same hospital as COVID‑19 patients, but 
also realize that they cannot effectively deliver their services, 
as most neurosurgical oncology cases demand ICU admission 
in the early postoperative period. This is often impossible, as 
ICUs prioritize and reserve capacity for COVID‑19 patients. In 
a highly endemic area, such as Lombardy, Italy, these difficul￾ties have been effectively addressed by designating a regional 
dedicated COVID‑19 free neuro‑oncology center where all 
patients before admission undergo ‘COVID‑19 screening’ with 
body temperature, O2 saturation, C‑reactive protein, SGOT, 
SGPT levels, complete cell blood count, chest radiography, 
pharyngeal SARS‑CoV‑2 swab and a thorough interview. This 
has resulted in the treatment of a high volume of COVID‑19 
negative patients and high levels of patient satisfaction (35)
In places where COVID‑19 free centers are not available, 
current management is based on triage. Telephone or video 
visits are utilized in order to assess routine follow‑ups and 
management of asymptomatic benign or low‑grade tumors is 
postponed until a safer time, whereas malignant tumors and 
emergency cases are treated as in the pre‑COVID‑19 era. In 
order to avoid occupational exposure all patients requiring 
surgery should undergo ‘COVID‑19 screening’. If they are 
COVID‑19 positive they need to be transferred to dedicated 
COVID‑19 hospitals or wards where appropriate personal 
protective equipment for health care professionals, as well as 
negative pressure operating rooms (ORs) and corresponding 
ICU are available (36).
For patients undergoing chemotherapy conservative dosing 
is recommended in order to avoid immunosuppression. If viral 
symptoms occur patients should be immediately tested for 
SARS‑CoV‑2 and in case of positivity chemotherapy should 
be held until the patient fully recovers from the infection. 
Risks and benefits of therapy should then be re‑evaluated (37),
however, in some centers two negative SARS‑CoV‑2 tests 
are required before re‑initiation of chemotherapy. Finally, 
concerning radiation therapy, strict institutional policies are 
required in order to guarantee patient and health care workers' 
safety, as daily hospital visits are needed. In patients with 
suspected or confirmed SARS‑CoV‑2 infection radiotherapy
can be either withheld, or continue as long as their disease 
is mild and the radiation facility has measures in place that 
prevent potential spread to other patients and staff. On the 
other hand, in cases with significant viral symptoms, treatment
should be halted and resumed only after patient recovery (38).
Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) 
cancer is a very serious condition and the recent COVID‑19 
outbreak is an additional obstacle in the management of such 
patients. Of note, 1% of all patients who contracted COVID‑19 
had a history of cancer. In addition, a previous history of 
cancer has been associated with an increased risk of morbidity 
and mortality following SARS‑CoV‑2 infection, which has 
caused considerable distress among GI cancer patients (39).
The fear of spread of this novel disease, alongside the effort 
to preserve hospital resources, including ventilators, personal 
protective equipment (PPE), critical care resources, and blood 
products, has led many institutions to limit or postpone elective 
cancer procedures and cancel outpatient clinics. Lockdown and 
disruptions in transportation have made access to diagnostic 
procedures, such as biopsies difficult. Consequently cancer
patients are experiencing an unexpected delay in diagnosis, 
staging and cancer therapy, causing a further psychological 
burden (28) which is aggravated by the ‘combined’ fear of 
both cancer and COVID‑19 (40). Depression rates appear 
to have increased in GI cancer patients, as the relationship 
with their treating clinician has become more limited due to 
quarantine and social distancing and support from relatives is 
missing (41).

444 tsamakis et al: Psychosocial impact of COVId-19 pandemic
The new reality has forced the medical community to 
prioritize and explore alternative, non‑surgical therapeutic 
approaches for GI cancer patients. In advanced staged GI 
cancer patients in particular, initiation or continuing of 
chemotherapy has been implemented, although the induced 
immunosuppression raises the risk for increased morbidity 
and death in the event of a SARS‑CoV‑2 infection (42). On the 
other hand, delays in treatment for GI cancer patients could 
result in unfavorable clinical outcomes, as a number of elec￾tive surgeries for GI cancer become urgent as time passes (43). 
After all, a ‘reasonable’ time‑frame should be maintained for 
GI cancer patients, if the medical community does not want to 
report such patients as the ‘occult pandemic victims’.
Lung cancer patients. COVID‑19 pandemic has affected the 
management of patients with lung cancer rather significantly.
Risk factors for COVID‑19 related complications in this 
patient group include older age, significant cardiovascular 
and respiratory co‑morbidities, smoking‑related lung damage, 
poor nutritional status and treatment related immunosuppres￾sion (8,44). One of the most critical issues of managing lung 
cancer patients during this pandemic, is the overlap between 
the radiological manifestations and especially the CT findings
of COVID‑19 induced pneumonia, with those that are often 
found upon disease progression, or onset of concomitant 
pneumonia due to overlapping opportunistic infections, or 
immune‑checkpoint related pneumonitis (45,46). As a result, 
distinguishing lung cancer progression or a drug‑related 
complication from potential COVID‑19 infection is a great 
challenge for clinicians, especially since different therapeutic 
approaches (47) and strategies are required on each occa￾sion. Thus, the management of lung cancer patients should 
undoubtedly involve increased attention to their clinical and 
radiological pulmonary signs.
In this context, and considering the high transmissibility 
rate of SARS‑Cov‑2, standard‑of‑care treatment regimens 
have been adapted for lung cancer patients, mainly in order 
to minimize the number of hospital visits and hospitalization 
and to prevent anticancer treatment‑induced complications. 
Furthermore, oncology canters have implemented several 
strategies, also followed on other types of cancer, such as 
converting intravenous treatments to oral regimens whenever 
possible, switching cytotoxic chemotherapy to less toxic treat￾ments, pausing therapies once the disease has become stable 
and replacing oncological surgery with stereotaxic radio￾therapy in early stage disease (IA‑IB).
Patients with malignant melanoma. The COVID‑19 pandemic 
has posed new challenges in managing patients with malignant 
melanoma, a less common but far more dangerous type of skin 
cancer, because of its ability to metastasize to other organs, if not 
treated at an early stage (48). During this novel pandemic, sched￾uled follow‑up appointments for melanoma patients have been 
cancelled or replaced by telephone consultations. Frequently 
there are temporary delays in organizing surgical procedures for 
removal of suspicious moles and imaging tests, including staging 
CT and MRI scans. This further increases the uncertainty 
patients and their caregivers are already experiencing.
Many of the melanoma patients, especially those with 
advanced disease, are being treated with targeted therapy 
or immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting (49). 
Considering that these cancer related treatments may cause 
immunosuppression, patients' anxiety increases further as they 
feel more vulnerable to contracting COVID‑19. Experience 
from patient support groups shows that many melanoma survi￾vors express stress and feelings of helplessness due to the new 
pandemic. This is further aggravated by the fact that mela￾noma support groups are no longer able to meet (50). Amid 
this overwhelming pandemic though, community support 
groups consisting of volunteers are being set up, in order to 
support isolated melanoma patients (51).
Gynaecological cancers. As with other malignancies, the 
care of women suffering from gynaecological cancers has 
been severely affected by the COVID‑19 pandemic. Several 
modalities are used in the treatment of gynaecological cancers: 
surgery, radiation and intravenous systemic therapy, including 
chemotherapy, targeted therapies and immunotherapy. From the 
surgical point of view, the availability of OR space and personnel 
for prolonged operations, blood bank resources and ICU beds 
may directly impact the decision of whether to proceed with 
an operable case, weighed against the oncological safety of its 
delay (52,53). Even the theoretical pneumoperitoneum‑related 
risks of minimally invasive surgery in the COVID‑19 context 
should be carefully weighed against the higher morbidity 
linked to laparotomy, along with the latter's need for prolonged 
hospitalization (52,54) As far as chemotherapy and other 
anti‑cancer treatments are concerned, the possible immuno￾compromising of patients may increase their susceptibility to 
viral infections and severe clinical manifestations (52,55). Of 
note, experience of oncology patients in Wuhan lends support 
to the above (8,44). Lastly, barriers pertaining to the access to 
diagnosis and treatment for patients with symptoms indicative 
of gynaecological cancer should not be underestimated.
To maximize the quality of gynaecological cancer care, 
alongside the safety of the patients, their families and health 
professionals, all the major societies in the field released 
guidelines that, in general, focus on: ‘less surgery, less hospital 
visits and more protective measures against the COVID‑19 
spread’ (52,53,55,56). The application of these recommenda￾tions to current clinical practice is highly dependent on the 
local/regional pandemic statistics, infrastructure of health 
services and individual patient's needs. Importantly, the formula￾tion of the treatment plan should follow an open and meticulous 
discussion with the patient, extending from the pre‑pandemic 
standard of care to the oncologic implications of the emerging 
alternatives and the risks of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.
Thyroid cancer. Despite progress in thyroid cancer diagnosis 
and treatment resulting in increased operative options and 
improved surveillance strategies, it should be kept in mind 
that every hospital visit, diagnostic intervention or opera￾tion, exposes patients and health care providers to the risk of 
contracting COVID‑19. The American College of Surgeons 
(ACS) (57) issued a statement calling for a thoughtful review 
of all scheduled elective procedures with a plan to minimize, 
postpone, or cancel electively scheduled operations, endos￾copies, or other invasive procedures, until there is confidence
that the health care infrastructure can support a potentially 
rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs. 

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 20: 441-447, 2020 445
It is highly probable that cancer morbidity or even mortality 
will rise, not only because of the direct implications of 
SARS‑CoV‑2 infections, but also because of deviations from 
usual cancer care pathways. Previous experience shows that, 
during pandemics, healthcare systems implement a triage 
system that could potentially deny critical care treatment to 
some seriously ill patients (58).
COVID‑19 has entered mainstream consciousness and 
disrupted normal flow of thyroid surgeries. Furthermore, it
increased patient's anxiety regarding diagnosis and prompt 
treatment. Elective interventions and non‑emergency opera￾tions are deferred (59) and further new challenges have arisen. 
For instance, a mild airway compression from large goiters 
is subacute or chronic, and does not cause symptoms (60); 
but what if such a patient requires immediate intubation due 
to acute COVID‑19‑induced respiratory distress? This could 
result in significant and probably fatal airway compromise
and subsequently many patients with large goiters are very 
concerned about their postponed surgeries.
In addition, most differentiated (DTC) and medullary 
thyroid cancers (MTC) are slow‑growing tumors that do not 
cause significant short‑term morbidity, but there is a subset of
more aggressive cancers that progress more rapidly. Therefore, 
clinical correlation with rate of progression, size, invasiveness 
of surrounding structures, and proximity to critical structures 
is recommended in the COVID‑19 context (61). In patients 
living with such types of asymptomatic cancer, the disease 
might progress in the absence of treatment. This might lead 
to metastatic disease or even death, or make more complex 
operations necessary, with increased complication rates (i.e., 
MTC or some rare invasive types of DTC) (62‑64).
Paediatric oncology. Although attention on the consequences 
of the COVID‑19 pandemic has mainly focused on adult 
patients, children, especially those in high risk groups such 
as the immunocompromised, are also affected mentally and 
physically. Bouffet et al (65) highlighted the need for urgent 
preparedness to protect the paediatric oncology population 
by sharing knowledge and experience on the impact of the 
pandemic on these patients. An international paediatric haema￾tology/oncology group provided data on COVID‑19 incidence 
in almost 10,000 children treated with chemotherapy or inten￾sive immunosuppression. Of 200 symptomatic children tested, 
only 8 patients were found to be positive for the SARS‑CoV‑2, 
leading to the proposition that a SARS‑CoV‑2 infection might 
be expressed as mild disease in children with cancer (66).
However, the indirect impact of the COVID‑19 pandemic 
on children with cancer and their families should not be 
overlooked. A recent study in cancer patients in Milan, which 
involved adolescents among other young participants, revealed 
that a large proportion of patients with cancer were worried and 
felt personally at risk of severe complications, with their parents' 
concern for them as an additional burden (67). In addition, the 
reduction of resources, in both materials and staff, has resulted 
in decreased access to routine care. An overwhelmed healthcare 
system could lead to limited support for the multiple needs of 
this vulnerable population, such as intravenous treatments at 
home, palliative care and low‑threshold access to hospital.
Moreover, paediatric oncology patients face an increased 
risk of infections (68). The single most effective interven￾tion to reduce the transmission of infectious agents is good 
hand hygiene. Unfortunately low adherence to hand hygiene 
protocols can occur in paediatric oncology departments 
as demonstrated by Kouni et al (69) in a study where only 
25.7% of staff practiced appropriate hand hygiene measures 
while caring for children with cancer. However, since the 
emergence of SARS‑CoV‑2 there has been an increasing 
investment in capacity building, education and training in 
hand hygiene measures. This might be a positive outcome 
of the pandemic after all, with lessons on the importance of 
prevention of infections learned both by healthcare staff and 
the general public.
4. Conclusions
Oncology patients deserve particular attention during the 
current pandemic as they are immunocompromised and 
vulnerable to severe of outcomes of a SARS‑CoV‑2 infection, 
due to both the underlying malignancy and various anticancer 
treatments.
Cancer therapies are of proven benefit, but in light of the
serious consequences of potential concurrent SARS‑CoV‑2 
infection, risk‑to‑benefit considerations are becoming increas￾ingly important. For each individual patient their disease 
status, age, frailty, and comorbidities (10) should be consid￾ered, as well as the potential of alternative strategies of care 
delivery. When possible, oral regimens should be preferred, 
and regimen administration intervals could be redefined, 
while postponing treatments or other invasive investigations 
could be considered for patients with asymptomatic and slow 
progressing cancers.
Telemedicine is increasingly being used by oncologists 
and patients with largely positive experiences for both 
groups. This process needs to be accelerated, increasing 
accessibility and quality of the interaction and data gath￾ered. Furthermore, the threshold for patients with signs or 
symptoms of potential underlying malignancies accessing 
diagnosis and treatment should be kept as low as possible. 
The psychological impact of not only the cancer, but also the 
increased social distancing and shielding measures many 
of the patients face, requires consideration. Patient support 
groups online and access to supportive and more formal 
psychological help need to be planned and be accessible. 
Lastly, the current situation of the pandemic will force clini￾cians to make difficult decisions; however, if decisions are
made thoughtfully, transparently and in collaboration with 
patients and carers (70) confidence in the healthcare system
will remain high.
