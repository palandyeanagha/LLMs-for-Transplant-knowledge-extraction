Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major complication 
of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). GVHD can present 
in acute and chronic forms, which differ in their time of onset 
and symptoms. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) occurs early after trans￾plantation, with target organ damage characterized by apopto￾sis. In contrast, chronic GVHD (cGVHD) is a late complication 
of SCT and is characterized by fibrosis. Indeed, cGVHD presents 
with many features that overlap with certain autoimmune dis￾eases. While skin is the primary organ involved in cGVHD, both 
lung and liver fibrosis can also occur, and these manifestations 
are all associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Our 
understanding of the pathophysiology of aGVHD is far more 
advanced than that of cGVHD, and it is clear that these forms 
are mediated by different immunological subsets and cytokine 
networks. Currently, the majority of clinical allogeneic trans￾plants use granulocyte colony–stimulating factor–mobilized 
(G-CSF–mobilized) peripheral blood (PB) stem cells, which has 
led to rapid hematopoietic reconstitution, improved leukemic 
eradication, and similar levels of aGVHD, but increased levels of 
cGVHD (1). Therapeutically, there are limited options available 
for the treatment of cGVHD, with corticosteroids representing 
the mainstay of treatment. Unfortunately, this is often ineffec￾tive and is associated with significant morbidity, thus cGVHD 
represents an increasing burden in the clinic.
Macrophages play an essential role in both homeostasis and 
pathology and are characterized by high functional heterogeneity 
(2). The differentiation, proliferation, and survival of the majority 
of macrophage populations are dependent on colony-stimulating 
factor 1 (CSF-1) (3, 4). Macrophages acquire diverse phenotypic and 
functional forms in response to local cytokines and microbial sig￾nals, which has resulted in the “M1” and “M2” macrophage clas￾sifications (5, 6). Classically activated macrophages (M1) mediate 
defense of the host from a variety of bacteria, protozoa, and viruses 
and have roles in antitumor immunity. Activation of proinflamma￾tory M1 macrophages is typically induced by IFN-γ, lipopolysaccha￾ride, and cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimu￾lating factor (GM-CSF) (5–7). Alternatively activated macrophages 
(M2) have antiinflammatory functions and regulate tissue repair 
and remodeling. M2 macrophage activation is induced by IL-4 and 
IL-13 (8) as well as immune complexes, glucocorticoids, and the 
Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) is the major cause of late, nonrelapse death following stem cell transplantation and characteristically 
develops in organs such as skin and lung. Here, we used multiple murine models of cGVHD to investigate the contribution of 
macrophage populations in the development of cGVHD. Using an established IL-17–dependent sclerodermatous cGVHD model, 
we confirmed that macrophages infiltrating the skin are derived from donor bone marrow (F4/80+
CSF-1R+
CD206+
iNOS–
). 
Cutaneous cGVHD developed in a CSF-1/CSF-1R–dependent manner, as treatment of recipients after transplantation with 
CSF-1 exacerbated macrophage infiltration and cutaneous pathology. Additionally, recipients of grafts from Csf1r–/– mice 
had substantially less macrophage infiltration and cutaneous pathology as compared with those receiving wild-type grafts. 
Neither CCL2/CCR2 nor GM-CSF/GM-CSFR signaling pathways were required for macrophage infiltration or development 
of cGVHD. In a different cGVHD model, in which bronchiolitis obliterans is a prominent manifestation, F4/80+
 macrophage 
infiltration was similarly noted in the lungs of recipients after transplantation, and lung cGVHD was also IL-17 and CSF-1/
CSF-1R dependent. Importantly, depletion of macrophages using an anti–CSF-1R mAb markedly reduced cutaneous and 
pulmonary cGVHD. Taken together, these data indicate that donor macrophages mediate the development of cGVHD and 
suggest that targeting CSF-1 signaling after transplantation may prevent and treat cGVHD.

Results
F4/80+
 macrophages infiltrate 
the skin of mice receiving either 
G-CSF–mobilized or –nonmobilized 
grafts. We investigated the kinet￾ics of macrophage infiltration into 
the skin after transplantation in 
lethally irradiated mice receiving 
either allogeneic, G-CSF–mobilized 
(G-CSF BALB/c graft → C57Bl/6 
[B6] recipients; Figure 1, A–D), 
or semiallogeneic, nonmobilized 
grafts (B6 bone marrow [BM] plus 
T cell graft → B6D2F1 recipients; 
Figure 1, E–H) that develop sclero￾dermatous cGVHD. IHC analysis 
for F4/80 expression demonstrated 
that F4/80+
 macrophages infil￾trated the dermis of mice receiving 
G-CSF–mobilized grafts starting 7 
days after transplantation (Figure 1, 
A and B), with robust F4/80+
 mac￾rophage infiltration present by day 
21 after transplantation throughout 
the dermis and s.c. fat layers (Fig￾ure 1C). We noted minimal macrophage infiltration in mice that 
received G-CSF–mobilized T cell–depleted (TCD) grafts (Figure 
1D). In mice receiving nonmobilized grafts, we noted F4/80+
 mac￾rophage infiltration in the dermis by day 21 after transplantation 
(Figure 1E), and by day 28 after transplantation, F4/80+
 macro￾phages were predominantly located within the s.c. fat layer (Figure 
1, F and G), with minimal macrophage infiltration noted in mice 
that received TCD grafts (Figure 1H). Although not examined here, 
our initial studies also identified neutrophils and T cells within the 
mononuclear infiltrate in skin during GVHD (9), however, they 
were far less dominant than the F4/80+
 macrophage infiltrate illus￾trated in Figure 1, and only the macrophages were IL-17 dependent.
Skin-infiltrating macrophages are donor M2–like CSF-1R–
expressing macrophages. To examine the phenotype of these 
F4/80+
 macrophages, IHC was performed using markers for both 
classically activated and alternatively activated macrophages 
(inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS] and mannose receptor 
CD206, respectively). Additionally, IHC for the congenic marker 
CD45.1 was used to mark donor cells. IHC in serial sections was 
performed 21 days after transplantation in lethally irradiated mice 
receiving either G-CSF–mobilized non-TCD grafts (cGVHD mice) 
or G-CSF–mobilized TCD grafts (no cGVHD controls). Results 
confirmed that the vast majority of infiltrating F4/80+
 cells in mice 
receiving G-CSF–mobilized grafts were donor (CD45.1+
) alter￾natively activated (CD206+
) macrophages, with minimal iNOS 
expression (F4/80+
CD45.1+
CD206+
iNOS–
) (Figure 2A and Sup￾plemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with 
this article; doi:10.1172/JCI75935DS1). We noted minimal donor 
macrophage infiltration in mice that received G-CSF–mobilized 
cytokine CSF-1 (6, 7). Although the M1 and M2 classification sys￾tem is widely used, it is increasingly clear that these macrophage 
populations represent the extreme ends of a wide spectrum of phe￾notypes associated with macrophage activation.
Recent preclinical and clinical data from our group estab￾lished a highly reproducible and informative model of cGVHD 
that supports a role for IL-17 as a central mediator of pathology, 
particularly within the skin (9). Cutaneous cGVHD was shown 
to be exacerbated by G-CSF mobilization in an IL-17–dependent 
manner, and late after transplantation, scleroderma was absent in 
recipients of Il17a–/– grafts compared with wild-type (WT) grafts. 
Interestingly, IL-17A controlled the infiltration of F4/80+
 macro￾phages into skin, and this preceded the development of sclero￾derma, suggesting that macrophages play important profibrotic 
roles in the development of cutaneous cGVHD.
There is an expanding body of evidence suggesting that mac￾rophages can play both anti- (10, 11) and profibrotic roles (12, 13). 
To date, models of macrophage depletion in vivo have been unsat￾isfactory, inducing rapid cell death and inflammation that compli￾cate experimental conclusions. Nevertheless, studies in renal (13), 
hepatic (10), lung (12), and skin fibrosis (14, 15) suggest that macro￾phage depletion can modify fibrosis. Cutaneous macrophage infil￾tration has been suggested to be associated with refractory aGVHD 
and poor prognosis (16). Alternatively, activated macrophages 
(CD163+
) have been previously shown to be present in both humans 
(17) and rats with systemic sclerosis (18). Additionally, macrophages 
displaying an M2 phenotype are present in the skin (19) and lungs of 
patients with systemic sclerosis (20). However, there are no studies 
to date that demonstrate a causal role of macrophages in the devel￾Figure 1. F4/80+

ated PB monocyte populations in 
naive B6.WT, B6.Ccr2–/–, and B6 
common β chain–/– mice to exam￾ine the requirement of chemokine 
(C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and 
GM-CSF, respectively. To exam￾ine the requirement of CSF-1, we 
used fetal liver chimeras (FLCs) 
on a B6 background, since CSF-1R 
deficiency is neonatally lethal. We 
examined monocyte populations 
using a gating strategy (Figure 
3A) that removed Ly6G+
CD3+
 and 
high side-scatter cells (SSCs). As 
expected, compared with B6.WT 
mice, we observed a significant 
reduction in the frequency and 
absolute numbers of circulating 
CD11b+
F4/80+
Ly6Chi classical 
monocytes in the Ccr2–/– mice 
(Figure 3, B and C; **P = 0.004, 
**P = 0.0081). In contrast, com￾pared with B6.WT FLCs, we found 
that the B6 Csf1r–/– FLCs exhibited 
a significant reduction in Ly6Clo
subset frequencies and abso￾lute numbers (Figure 3, B and C; 
***P = 0.002, *P = 0.0286). The 
contribution of GM-CSF to cir￾culating monocyte populations 
was minimal, since the frequencies and absolute numbers of both 
Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo cell populations were not significantly altered in 
the common β chain–deficient mice.
CSF-1 treatment after SCT exacerbates cutaneous cGVHD. We 
had previously confirmed in Figure 3 that CSF-1 was required for 
the development of the Ly6Clo PB monocyte/macrophage popu￾lation, which is suggested to be a tissue macrophage precursor. 
Therefore, we further examined the contribution of CSF-1 to mac￾rophage infiltration and cutaneous cGVHD after transplantation. 
Lethally irradiated B6 mice received G-CSF–mobilized BALB/c 
whole spleen or TCD spleen and were treated with either saline 
or CSF-1 for 5 days from day 14 after transplantation. Compared 
with saline-treated recipients, we found that CSF-1 treatment 
significantly increased F4/80+
 macrophages in the skin 19 days 
after transplantation (Figure 4A), quantified as positive pixels/
mm2
 (Figure 4B; **P = 0.0017). CSF-1 treatment preferentially 
expanded donor alternatively activated macrophages, as con￾firmed via IHC (F4/80+
CD45.1+
CD206+
iNOS–
) (Figure 4C). Semi￾quantitative histopathology confirmed that recipients treated with 
CSF-1 had significantly higher cutaneous pathology scores than 
did those treated with saline (Figure 4D; **P = 0.0087).
Further analysis of PB monocyte populations 19 days after 
transplantation illustrated a trend toward an increase in the fre￾quency of Ly6Clo cells after 5 days of CSF-1 treatment (Figure 
5A). Therefore, we carried out further monocyte/macrophage 
analysis of cells isolated 19 days after transplantation from the 
skin (ears) of mice treated with either saline or CSF-1 (gating 
TCD grafts. We also noted alternatively activated macrophage 
infiltrate in lethally irradiated mice that received nonmobilized 
grafts (data not shown). B6D2F1 mice receiving BM plus T cell 
grafts from MacGreen mice (MacGreen mice have EGFP driven 
off the Csf1r promoter) (21) confirmed that these F4/80+
 macro￾phages are also CSF-1R+
 (Figure 2B). Using the same transplanta￾tion system, we additionally confirmed that donor (CSF-1R+
) cells 
infiltrate the skin as early as 7 days after transplantation (Supple￾mental Figure 2A), and by day 21, the vast majority of F4/80+
 cells 
are of donor origin (Supplemental Figure 2B).
Cytokine/chemokine dependency of blood monocyte populations 
in naive mice. Current dogma holds that circulating monocytes can 
give rise to a variety of tissue-resident macrophages throughout the 
body, particularly during inflammation. In the steady state, circulat￾ing CD11b+
F4/80+
 monocytes can be divided into 2 distinct cell pop￾ulations based on the expression of Ly6C (22). CD11b+
F4/80+
Ly6Chi
monocytes express the C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) 
and are commonly referred to as classical or inflammatory mono￾cytes. In contrast, CD11b+
F4/80+
Ly6Clo monocytes are CCR2–
, 
but express the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 and are commonly 
referred to as patrolling monocytes, which are widely considered to 
be tissue-resident macrophage precursors. To elucidate the mono￾cyte precursors and cytokine dependency of the donor infiltrating 
macrophages following BM transplantation (BMT), we next exam￾ined the cytokine and chemokine requirements for the development 
and migration of the distinct PB monocyte populations. For these 
studies, we examined both frequency (percentage) and enumer￾Figure 2. F4/80+

illustrates that at day 21 after transplantation, donor M2–like macrophages were present within the skin (F4/80+

Csf1r–/– grafts had a significantly lower clinical GVHD score through￾out the time course examined compared with that of WT graft 
recipients (Figure 6A). IHC performed 21 days after transplanta￾tion illustrated that mice receiving WT grafts (Figure 6B) had sig￾nificantly higher F4/80+
 macrophage infiltration compared with 
that seen in mice receiving Csf1r–/– grafts (Figure 6B), quantified as 
positive pixels/mm2
 (Figure 6C; **P = 0.003). Masson’s trichrome 
staining (collagen fibers are stained blue) and semiquantitative his￾topathology scores assessed 48 days after transplantation confirmed 
that mice receiving Csf1r–/– grafts had significantly lower cutaneous 
pathology and fibrosis than did those receiving WT grafts (Fig￾ure 6D; *P = 0.045, **P = 0.008), confirming a pathogenic role for 
CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling in the development of cutaneous pathol￾ogy after transplantation. Analysis of PB monocyte populations 21 
days after transplantation illustrated that recipients of Csf1r–/– FLC 
grafts exhibited a significant increase in the frequency of Ly6Chi cells 
and a significant reduction in the Ly6Clo cell population (Figure 6E; 
*P = 0.0286). Other CSF-1R–dependent cells reside within the skin 
apart from macrophages, most notably langerin-expressing Langer￾hans cells, which reside in the epidermis. In contrast to macrophages, 
strategy for monocyte/macrophage analysis; Figure 5B). We per￾formed analysis using a gating strategy similar to that shown in 
Figure 3A, with monocytes (Figure 5B, Mono) being classified as 
Ly6CloSSC loF4/80+
CD11b+
 and macrophages (Figure 5B, Mɸ) as 
Ly6CloSSChiF4/80+
. Data are expressed as the absolute number 
of CD45+
 cells for both monocytes and macrophages (Figure 5C). 
We observed a significant increase in absolute numbers in both the 
CD45+
 monocyte population (Ly6CloCD11b+
F4/80+
) (Figure 5C; 
**P = 0.0087) and CD45+
 macrophage population (Ly6CloF4/80+
) 
(Figure 5C; *P = 0.026) in the CSF-1–treated mice compared with 
the absolute numbers detected in saline-treated mice. Overall, 
this confirmed that CSF-1 treatment after transplantation signifi￾cantly increased cutaneous Ly6Clo monocytes and macrophages 
compared with those detected in saline-treated recipients.
F4/80+
 macrophage infiltration and cutaneous fibrosis after trans￾plantation is CSF-1R dependent. We subsequently investigated the 
requirement for donor CSF-1R signaling in the development of 
cutaneous cGVHD using WT and Csf1r–/– FLCs. Lethally irradiated 
B6D2F1 recipients were given BM plus T cell grafts from either B6 
WT FLC, Csf1r–/– FLC, or WT FLC TCD grafts. Mice that received

tion of GM-CSF signaling 
to macrophage infiltration 
and cutaneous GVHD. 
Serum GM-CSF was only 
detected 7 days after trans￾plantation (Figure 7A; 
*P = 0.01), with no differ￾ence in serum GM-CSF 
levels between mice 
receiving either allogeneic 
or TCD grafts from day 
14 after transplantation. 
F4/80+
 macrophages were 
still noted 21 days after 
transplantation in the skin 
of lethally irradiated mice 
that received WT or com￾mon β chain–/– BM plus 
T cell grafts (Figure 7B). 
The common β chain–/–
mouse has defective sig￾naling for IL-3 and IL-5 
as well as for GM-CSFR 
signaling (24), therefore, 
we specifically blocked 
GM-CSFR signaling with 
an anti–GM-CSF Ab 
(M250 mAb; Amgen). 
Treatment with M250 
starting 7 days after trans￾plantation had no effect 
on F4/80+
 macrophage 
infiltration (Figure 7C), 
quantified as positive 
pixels/mm2
 (Figure 7D). 
PB monocyte analysis 21 
days after transplantation 
showed no change in the 
frequencies of Ly6Chi and 
Ly6Clo cell populations in mice receiving either B6 WT or B6 com￾mon B chain–/– grafts (Figure 7E). Thus, GM-CSF is not required 
for the infiltration of F4/80+
 macrophages and the subsequent 
development of cutaneous pathology after transplantation.
Development of cutaneous pathology is CCR2 independent. 
Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2), a multi￾functional chemokine belonging to the C–C chemokine super￾family, has been shown to be upregulated in a variety of fibrotic 
conditions (25–27). Furthermore, patients with scleroderma 
exhibit elevated levels of CCL2 in both serum and skin (28, 29). 
Similarly, we found elevated levels of CCL2 in the serum from 7 to 
28 days after transplantation in lethally irradiated mice receiving 
BM plus T cell grafts (Allo) compared with levels detected in TCD 
non-GVHD controls (Figure 8A). To investigate the contribution 
of donor CCL2/CCR2 signaling to the development of cutaneous 
GVHD, lethally irradiated mice received BM from B6 WT or B6 
Ccr2–/– mice with B6 WT T cells. IHC demonstrated that F4/80+
macrophages were still present in the skin 28 days after transplan￾however, Langerhans cells are instructed by the alternative CSF-1R 
ligand IL-34 (23). To investigate the contribution of Langerhans cells 
to the development of CSF-1R–dependent sclerodermatous cGVHD, 
mice received BM and T cell grafts from langerin-diphtheria toxin 
receptor–transgenic (langerin-DTR–transgenic) mice in which DTR 
and EGFP are expressed under the control of the Cd207 (encoding 
langerin) promoter. Administration of DT between 7 and 40 days 
after transplantation effectively depleted donor Langerhans cells 
(Supplemental Figure 3A), but neither F4/80+
 macrophage infiltra￾tion nor the development of cutaneous pathology was altered (Sup￾plemental Figure 3, B and C), thus establishing that Langerhans cells 
do not contribute to cutaneous cGVHD.
F4/80+
 macrophage infiltration and cutaneous fibrosis after 
transplantation is GM-CSFR independent. Both CSF-1/CSF-1R and 
GM-CSF/GM-CSFR signaling pathways are involved in regulating 
the number and function of macrophage lineage populations, and 
both signaling pathways have been shown to contribute to mac￾rophage heterogeneity (7). Therefore, we examined the contribu￾Figure 4. CSF-1 treatment after SCT exacerbates cutaneous cGVHD. Lethally irradiated B6 mice received G-CSF–mobi￾lized WT BALB/c (CD45.1) or TCD grafts and were treated with either saline or CSF-1 (10 μg/daily) from days 14 to 19 after 
transplantation. (A) Representative IHC images of F4/80 expression in the skin of saline- and CSF-1–treated mice. CSF-1 
treatment resulted in a significant increase in F4/80+
 cells within the skin compared with cells detected in saline-treated

 (**P = 0.007). (C) CSF-1 treatment preferentially expanded donor

Mann-Whitney U tests. Data represent the mean ± SEM. Original magnification, ×5 (A and B) and ×8 (C).

tation in mice receiving either B6 WT or B6 Ccr2–/– grafts (Fig￾ure 8B), quantified as positive pixels/mm2
 (Figure 8C). We also 
observed no difference in cutaneous pathology in the recipients of 
WT or Ccr2–/– grafts (Figure 8, D and E). Similarly, Ab-mediated 
blockade using an anti-CCL2 Ab had no significant effect on 
F4/80+
 macrophage infiltration (Figure 8, F and G) or subsequent 
cutaneous pathology (Figure 8H). PB monocyte analysis 21 days 
after transplantation illustrated no change in the frequencies of 
Ly6Chi or Ly6Clo cell populations in mice receiving either B6 WT 
or B6 Ccr2–/– grafts (Figure 8I). Thus, CCL2/CCR2 signaling is not 
required for the infiltration of F4/80+
 macrophages and the subse￾quent development of cutaneous pathology after transplantation. 
This suggests that the chemokine CCL2 is redundant for mono￾cyte recruitment in the context of the GVHD inflammatory milieu.
Anti–CSF-1R Ab treatment after transplantation attenuates 
cutaneous GVHD. To investigate whether depletion of the CSF-1/
CSF-1R–dependent macrophage population after transplantation 
was an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat cGVHD, 
we used an anti–CSF-1R Ab (M279; Amgen). We have previously 
demonstrated that M279 specifically depletes tissue-resident 
macrophages (30). Lethally irradiated B6 recipients of G-CSF–
mobilized BALB/c grafts were treated with either rat IgG control 
or M279 mAb beginning 7 days after transplantation. IHC staining 
demonstrated that M279 mAb treatment significantly depleted 
F4/80+
 macrophages in the skin compared with levels detected 
rat IgG–treated control mice (Figure 9A), quantified as positive 
pixels/mm2
 (Figure 9B; ***P = 0.002). Long-term depletion (out 
to day 48) of F4/80+
 macrophages in B6D2F1 mice that received 
B6 BM and T cells or TCD grafts also confirmed that M279 mAb 
treatment significantly reduced cutaneous GVHD (Figure 9, C and 
D; *P = 0.012), and similar to mice receiving Csf1r–/– grafts (Figure 
6D), M279-treated mice showed no evidence of cutaneous fibrosis

(Figure 9D; ***P = 0.0006). PB analysis on day 48 after transplan￾tation also confirmed that M279 mAb treatment resulted in a sig￾nificant increase in the frequency of Ly6Chi monocytes and a sig￾nificant decrease in Ly6Clo monocytes (Figure 9E; **P = 0.0012, 
*P = 0.0262). Thus, CSF-1R Ab–mediated depletion of donor mac￾rophages after transplantation may be an effective therapeutic 
strategy to prevent and/or treat cutaneous cGVHD.
Development of cutaneous GVHD is TGF-β dependent. We have 
previously reported that in the B10.BR → BALB/c model of sclero￾derma, skin-infiltrating CD11b+
 mononuclear cells produce high lev￾els of TGF-β, and neutralization of this cytokine attenuated cGVHD 
(31). We therefore speculated that TGF-β is a mediator of fibrotic 
skin pathology invoked by macrophages in the current study. Thus, 
we examined the expression of TGF-β in the CD11b+

Development of lung GVHD is IL-17 and CSF-1R dependent. Both 
transplantation models used above (G-CSF–mobilized BALB/c →
B6 and B6 BM plus T cell → B6D2F1) resulted in the development of 
scleroderma after transplantation, but neither model elicited fibrotic 
manifestations in other cGVHD target organs. Therefore, we next 
investigated the contribution of CSF-1/CSF-1R–dependent macro￾phages to cGVHD using the recently described multiorgan system 
cGVHD model (B6 → B10.BR) (32), in which lung injury is associ￾ated with obstructive lung disease and fibrosis, with increased col￾lagen deposition surrounding bronchioles (bronchiolitis obliterans 
PB monocyte precursor population after transplantation. Our results 
confirmed that the PB monocyte precursors to the pathogenic tissue 
macrophages rapidly produced TGF-β in response to TLR4 ligation 
with LPS (Supplemental Figure 4A). Furthermore, Ab blockade of 
TGF-β from days 14 to 46 after transplantation significantly reduced 
GVHD clinical scores and, importantly, significantly decreased 
cutaneous pathology compared with the control mAb–treated group 
(Supplemental Figure 4, B and C). Taken together, the data suggest 
that donor CSF-1R–dependent macrophages contribute to cGVHD 
via the expression of TGF-β.

airway resistance, which correlated with lung constriction (Resis￾tance), elevated elastance, which signifies increased stiffness or 
rigidity of the lungs (Elastance), and decreased total lung capacity

by airway blockage, peribronchiolar fibroproliferation, and oblitera￾tion of bronchioles and is a late-stage complication of GVHD. Pul￾monary function tests (PFTs) demonstrated that recipients of BM

and that effects may be mediated by T cells, innate lymphoid cells, or 
another as-yet uncharacterized cytokine-producing cell population. 
Development of lung pathology was also confirmed to be CSF-1R 
dependent, as recipients of Csf1r–/– grafts had significantly better pul￾monary function compared with that of mice receiving WT grafts or 
those receiving WT BM with Csf1r–/– splenocytes (Figure 10B). Recip￾ients of Csf1r–/– BM plus splenocyte grafts also displayed a significant 
and compliance (Compliance) (32). As with cutaneous GVHD (9), 
lung GVHD developed in an IL-17–dependent manner, since mice 
receiving grafts deficient in the retinoid-related orphan receptor γ
(Rorc–/–), which is required for lineage commitment in IL-17–produc￾ing cells, exhibited significantly better pulmonary function relative to 
that of mice receiving WT grafts (Figure 10A). We acknowledge that 
we cannot discriminate the cellular sources of IL-17 by this approach

environment including an early systemic release of MCP-1 and 
GM-CSF, our data surprisingly illustrate that neither CCR2 nor 
GM-CSF signaling is required for the development of cutaneous 
GVHD and that, instead, fibrosis in both skin and lung models of 
GVHD is CSF-1 dependent. Blocking the action of CSF-1/CSF-1R 
using either Csf1r–/– mice or an anti–CSF-1R Ab resulted in a sig￾nificant decrease in Ly6Clo cell populations in both the blood and 
skin. As previously observed (30), the reduction in the Ly6Clo cell 
population was balanced by an increase in the Ly6Chi cell popu￾lation, supporting the proposed model that suggests a precursor 
relationship between the immature inflammatory monocytes and 
mature resident monocytes in vivo (36, 41). Therefore, we pro￾pose that the precursor to the pathogenic tissue macrophages that 
sequester in the GVHD target organs is a nonclassical/patrolling 
F4/80+
CD11b+
Ly6Clo donor BM–derived monocyte subset.
Macrophages and CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling have already been 
shown to contribute to engraftment and the development of 
aGVHD following transplantation (42). CSF-1 levels are substan￾tially elevated in the circulation in mice with aGVHD, which could 
function to extend the survival of host macrophages after trans￾plantation (43). We previously demonstrated that pretreatment 
of recipients with the anti–CSF-1R mAb M279 prior to allogeneic 
BMT significantly ablated macrophages in GVHD target organs, 
resulting in exaggerated donor T cell activation and accelerated 
GVHD pathology after transplantation (30). Furthermore, host 
intestinal macrophages were also shown to engulf and clear donor 
T cells, thus contributing to the attenuation of alloreactive T cell 
responses (44). Therefore, donor and host macrophages appear 
to exert opposing effects on GVHD outcomes, with host macro￾phages being protective for aGVHD, while donor macrophages 
are pathogenic for cGVHD. Thus, in contrast to the attenuation of 
cGVHD that CSF-1 blockade provided, interrupting this pathway 
in the early peritransplantation period could exacerbate aGVHD. 
These observations are reminiscent of our earlier findings, in which 
TGF-β neutralization early after transplantation resulted in a sig￾nificant exacerbation of aGVHD, whereas delayed neutralization 
attenuated sclerodermatous cGVHD (31). In that study, a skin-in￾filtrating donor CD11b+
 mononuclear cell population expressed 
the highest levels of TGF-β. Here, we confirm and extend these 
findings, demonstrating that blockade of TGF-β after transplanta￾tion in the B6 → B6D2F1 model significantly reduced cutaneous 
pathology and further demonstrating TGF-β expression by the 
F4/80+
CD11b+
Ly6Clo blood monocyte precursor to the pathogenic 
skin macrophages. Taken together, the data support the notion that 
donor CSF-1–dependent skin-infiltrating macrophages contribute 
to cutaneous GVHD in a TGF-β–dependent manner.
These studies highlight Ly6Clo monocyte precursors, mac￾rophages, and their effector molecules (e.g., TGF-β) as poten￾tial targets for the prevention and treatment of cGVHD. In the 
current study, we have used a mAb against mouse CSF-1R that 
blocks the actions of CSF-1 without inducing apoptosis or overt 
inflammation (30). While it is clear that blockage of CSF-1R 
signaling can have functional consequences on tissue-resident 
macrophages (45), treatment with the anti–CSF-1R mAb M279 
following transplantation phenocopied the effects produced 
using a Csf1r–/– allograft (i.e., a dramatic reduction in skin-infil￾trating macrophages and attendant pathology). While we can￾reduction in collagen deposition around the bronchioles compared 
with recipients of WT grafts (Figure 10C), quantified as trichrome 
area/total area (Figure 10D). These data suggest that donor BM is 
the source of CSF-1R+
 tissue–resident macrophages that are essential 
for cGVHD-induced BO.
Last, we investigated whether M279 mAb treatment resulted 
in a reduction in lung cGVHD. Recipients were administered con￾trol IgG or M279 mAb after transplantation from days 0 to 28. IHC 
to detect F4/80 expression confirmed that macrophages infiltrated 
the lungs of mice that received BM plus Sp grafts and rat IgG (Fig￾ure 10E), with reduced F4/80+
 cell infiltration in recipients treated 
with M279 mAb. We noted minimal macrophage infiltration in 
mice that received BM-only grafts (Figure 10E). Furthermore, we 
found that M279 mAb treatment significantly improved all lung 
PFT parameters (Figure 10F) and resulted in a significant reduction 
in collagen deposition (Figure 10G), quantified as trichrome area/
total area (Figure 10H). Overall, these data confirm that cutane￾ous and pulmonary GVHD develop in a CSF-1/CSF-1R–dependent 
manner, and depletion of this population after transplantation rep￾resents a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat cGVHD.
Discussion
Macrophages have been shown to play crucial roles in tissue 
repair as well in the resolution and/or progression of tissue fibro￾sis (10–13). This study provides new insight into the pathogenic 
role of donor macrophages in the progression of fibrosis, the 
cardinal feature of cGVHD. We specifically demonstrate that 
CSF-1/CSF-1R–dependent donor BM–derived macrophages infil￾trate GVHD target organs as early as 7 days after transplantation, 
which precedes the development of cutaneous and pulmonary 
GVHD. The infiltration of these macrophages was demonstrated 
to be both CCR2 and GM-CSF independent. Most importantly, 
blocking the action of CSF-1/CSF-1R using either Csf1r–/– mice or 
an anti–CSF-1R Ab depleted these donor macrophages from the 
skin and lung, resulting in a dramatic reduction in cGVHD.
The origin of tissue-resident macrophages remains contro￾versial. During development, yolk sac and liver embryonic mac￾rophage precursors seed the resident macrophage populations of 
most tissues including the skin, liver, and lung. During the neo￾natal period, these tissue-resident macrophage populations are 
expanded by local proliferation and maintained during adulthood 
by self-renewal (33). In the gut, however, the resident macrophage 
population is derived from BM (34, 35). During injury or infection, 
PB monocytes can be recruited to tissues and sites of inflamma￾tion and give rise to a variety of tissue-resident macrophages. In 
mice, circulating monocyte populations can be divided into 2 dis￾tinct groups (22). The classical/inflammatory monocytes, which 
are classified as Ly6Chi, CCR2+
, and Cx3CR1lo, constitute the 
monocyte subset most likely to be recruited to sites of inflamma￾tion. The nonclassical/patrolling monocytes are Ly6Clo/–, CCR2lo/–, 
and Cx3CR1+
 and are thought to contribute to tissue-resident mac￾rophage populations (22, 36). Whether the patrolling monocytes 
give rise to tissue macrophages under steady state has recently 
come into question (37, 38). Importantly, during fibrosis, at least 
in the liver, macrophages are suggested to be derived from either 
tissue-resident cell populations, such as Kupffer cells, or from BM 
immigrants (39, 40). Although SCT induces a highly inflammatory

stitution of the immune system, and mice were confirmed to have 
donor engraftment greater than 98% before being used as transplant 
donors or recipients.
SCT and BMT. On day –1, mice received 1,000 cGy (B6) or 1,100 
cGy (B6D2F1) total-body irradiation (137 Cs source at approximately 
85 cGy/minute), split into 2 doses separated by 3 hours to minimize 
gastrointestinal toxicity. On day 0, B6 mice each received 25 × 106
donor Sp from G-GSF–mobilized BALB/c donors. Sp were depleted of 
T cells as previously described (52) for non-GVHD control groups. In 
BMT experiments, B6D2F1 recipients underwent transplantation on 
day 0 with 5 × 106 BM with or without 1 × 106 purified T cells. Mice 
received BM from either B6, common β chain–/–, Ccr2–/–, WT FLC, 
Csfr1–/– FLC, or langerin DTR-EGFP mice. Non-GVHD control groups 
were injected with TCD BM grafts. Transplanted mice were moni￾tored daily, and those with GVHD clinical scores greater than or equal 
to 6 (53, 54) were killed and the date of death registered as the next day 
in accordance with institutional animal ethics committee guidelines. 
Recipients of langerin DTR-EGFP grafts were treated with saline or 
DT (0.1 μg/mouse; Sigma-Aldrich) twice weekly from days 7 to 40. For 
Ab-mediated depletion, from 7 days after SCT, mice received either 
500 μg every 2 weeks of mouse IgG or anti–GM-CSFR (M250; Amgen) 
or 400 μg 3 times per week of anti–CSF-1R Ab (M279; Amgen) or rat 
IgG control Ab — all via i.p. injection. For TGF-β blockade, from 7 days 
after transplantation, mice were treated with either control or anti–
TGF-β Ab (in-house, ATCC) (20 μg/3 times per week) via i.p. injec￾tion. B10.BR recipients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide on 
days −3 and −2 (120 mg/kg/day i.p.). On day −1, mice received lethal 
irradiation (850 cGy). On day 0, mice received 1 × 107
 BM cells from 
either WT B6, WT FLC, or Csf1r–/– FLC mice with 1 × 106 Sp from either 
WT B6 or Csf1r–/– B6 mice or from Rorc–/– B6 mice.
Assessment of GVHD. The degree of systemic GVHD was assessed 
using a cumulative scoring system that measures changes based on 
5 clinical parameters: weight loss, posture (hunching), activity, fur 
texture, and skin integrity (maximum index 10). Mice were monitored 
daily, and those with GVHD clinical scores (53) greater than or equal to 
6 were culled and the date of death recorded as the next day in accor￾dance with institutional animal ethics guidelines.
Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. The following anti￾bodies were purchased from BioLegend: phycoerythrin-conjugated 
(PE-conjugated) anti-F4/80, allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CCR2, 
PE-Cy7–conjugated anti-IA/IE, APC-Cy7–conjugated anti-Ly6G, 
Pacific Blue–conjugated anti-Ly6, and PerCP-Cy5.5–conjugated 
CD11b. PE.CF594-conjugated CD3 was purchased from BD Biosci￾ences. Biotinylated anti–TGF-β was purchased from R&D Systems.
Tissue digests. For ear skin digests, the ears were removed and each 
ear split into dorsal and ventral surfaces with forceps. Skin was floated 
on 2 ml of dispase solution (Gibco) and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. 
Dermal and epidermal sheets were detached with forceps and trans￾ferred to 2 ml of a 0.1-mg/ml collagenase solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in 
HBSS (Mediatech) with Ca++ supplemented with 10% FBS, and 250 μl 
of 20,000 U/ml DNAse I (Roche) per 50-ml working solution. Skin 
was cut into small pieces and incubated for 1.5 hours at 37°C. Epider￾mal and dermal cells were disaggregated by pipetting 10 times with a 
syringe and needle (19-gauge), filtered through nylon mesh to remove 
clumps, and the mesh was washed with flow buffer to reduce cell loss 
(1 × PBS/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 2 mM BSA 0.5%), then cen￾trifuged for 5 minutes at 400 g.
not completely exclude additional effects on function, the M279 
mAb appears to be acting on monocytes and macrophages in 
more of a quantitative rather than a qualitative fashion when 
used after BMT. There are multiple agents that target the CSF￾1R/CSF-1 pathway in clinical trials, predominantly to ablate 
tumor-associated macrophages as a means to limit tumor pro￾gression. These include a humanized version of the rodent CSF￾1R mAb used here. In addition, many small-molecule tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib are 
used in clinical practice to treat various malignancies. Interest￾ingly, imatinib, at least, has significant off-target effects that 
interrupt the CSF-1R pathway (46), and this agent has demon￾strated efficacy, albeit limited, in the treatment of cGVHD (47–
49). Together, it appears that targeting the CSF-1 pathway may 
provide an effective means for treating chronic GVHD, and clin￾ical trials to test this hypothesis could now be rapidly initiated.
Methods
Mice. Female C57Bl/6 (B6) (H-2b, CD45.2), B6.Ptprca
 (H-2b
, CD45.1+
), 
BALB/c (H-2d, CD45.2), and B6D2F1 (H-2b/d, CD45.2) mice were 
purchased from the Animal Resources Center. Mice were housed in 
sterilized microisolator cages and received acidified autoclaved water 
(pH 2.5) after transplantation. The mice ranged in age from 8 to 14 
weeks. BALB/c CD45.1+
 (H-2d
) mice were supplied by Mark Smyth 
(QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Queensland, Australia). 
Csf1r–/+ mice were provided by Richard E. Stanley (Albert Einstein Col￾lege of Medicine, New York, New York, USA). C-C chemokine receptor 
2 (Ccr2–/–) (50) mice were provided by Mark Smyth (QIMR Berghofer 
Medical Research Institute). Common β chain–/– (Csf2rbtm1Cgh)(24) 
mice were provided by Angel Lopez (Center for Cancer Biology, Ade￾laide, Australia). Langerin DTR-EGFP mice (Cd207tm3(DTR/GFP)Mal) were 
provided by Bernard Malissen (Centre d’Immunologie de Marseille, 
Luminy, France) (51). B10.BR (H-2k) mice were purchased from the 
Jackson Laboratory, and B6 (H2b
) mice were purchased from the 
National Cancer Institute.
Cytokine mobilization. Recombinant human G-CSF was adminis￾tered s.c. at 10 μg/animal daily for 6 days.
Generation of Csf1r–/– FLCs. To generate FLCs, mice heterozy￾gous for Csf1r deficiency were time-mated, and at E18/19, pregnant 
mice were culled, pups removed, and the fetal liver harvested into 
a single-cell suspension. A portion of each pup’s tail was harvested 
into QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Epicentre Biotech￾nologies) for genomic DNA extraction, and PCR was performed 
on each to determine both the Csf1r genotype (WT, heterozy￾gote, or homozygote) and the sex of each pup. Primer sequences 
for Csf1r genotyping were as follows: CSF-1R in exon 2, forward: 
5′-AGACTCATTCCAGAACCAGAGC-3′; CSF-1R in exon 3, reverse: 
5′-GAATTTGGAGTCCTCACCTTTG-3′; and CSF-1R neo, for￾ward: 5′-CCGGTAGAATTCCTCGAGTCTA-3′. Primer sequences 
for sex differentiation genotyping were as follows: X chromosome, 
forward: 5′-GTTCTTTCGTTTTCCCCTCTC-3′; X chromosome, 
reverse: 5′-GGCATTATCTAAGGAGAAGCATC-3′; Y chromosome 
(a): 5′-GACTAGACATGTCTTAACATCTGTCC-3′; and Y chromo￾some (b): 5′-CCTATTGCATGGACAGCAGCTTATG-3′. Female 
CSF-1R–KO and WT pups were identified, and 2 × 106 FLCs from 
each were injected separately into lethally irradiated (1,000 cGy) 
PTPRCA mice. These mice were left for 3 months to allow recon-

additional F(ab′) fragment–blocking step for CD45.1 Ab IHC](Jackson 
ImmunoResearch) and incubated in one of the following primary anti￾bodies: rat anti-mouse F4/80 (BioLegend), rat anti-mouse CD206 (AbD 
Serotec); rabbit anti-mouse iNOS (Abcam), or mouse anti-mouse CD45.1 
(BioLegend) or matching isotype controls, and normal Rabbit IgG (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or mouse IgG (BioLegend). Endogenous per￾oxidase activity was blocked using 3% H2
O2
. Cells were subsequently 
incubated with either goat anti-rat or goat anti-rabbit biotinylated F(ab′)2
fragment followed by HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Slides were devel￾oped as described above. Immunofluorescence (IF) of frozen tissues was 
performed as described above, but using streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 
Fluor 555 tertiary Ab. Slides were then stained with DAPI. All IHC slides 
were viewed using an Aperio Scanscope XT microscope with Scanscope 
software (version 10.2.2.2352). IF slides were viewed on an LSM 710 
confocal microscope (Zeiss) with ImageJ 1.44p software (NIH).
PFTs. PFTs were performed as described previously (55). Anes￾thetized mice were weighed, and lung function was assessed by 
whole-body plethysmography using the Flexivent system (SCIREQ) 
and analyzed with Flexivent version 5.1 software.
Cytokine analysis. Serum cytokine concentrations were deter￾mined using the BD Cytometric Bead Array system (BD Biosciences 
— Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Statistics. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier esti￾mates and compared by log-rank analysis using PRISM 5 (GraphPad 
Software). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. A 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test or an unpaired t test was 
used to evaluate significant differences between groups, and all data 
represent the mean ± SEM.
Study approval. All mouse experiments were performed in accor￾dance with and under the approval of the QIMR Berghofer Medical 
Research Institute’s Animal Ethics Committee and the IACUC of the 
University of Minnesota.

PB in vitro stimulation. Unfractionated red cell–lysed PB was cul￾tured with 100 ng LPS for 2 hours in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s 
medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1 mM sodium 
pyruvate (Thermo Scientific), 1 mM Pen Strep (Gibco), 1 mM gluta￾mine (HyClone), 1 mM nonessential amino acids (Gibco), and 23 mM 
β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich).
Histopathology and immunostaining of GVHD target organs. At var￾ious times after transplantation, GVHD target tissues were harvested, 
fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours, embedded in paraffin, and pro￾cessed to generate 5-μm-thick sections. All lung tissue harvested was 
embedded in optimal cutting–temperature compound, snap-frozen in 
liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Lungs were inflated by infusion 
of 1 ml of optimal cutting–temperature compound/PBS (3:1) intratra￾cheally before harvesting. H&E sections of skin were examined in a 
blinded fashion (by A.D. Clouston) using a semiquantitative scoring 
system for GVHD as previously published (54). Samples were scored 
from 0 to 4 for epidermal and dermal inflammation, dermal fibrosis 
and subcutaneous fibrosis (summed to give a total cutaneous fibrosis 
score of 8), epidermal apoptosis (total score of 4), and loss of s.c. fat 
(total score of 4). IHC was performed on deparaffinized and rehydrated 
sections. Briefly, slides were incubated with antigen retrieval solution 
(0.37% Carezyme Trypsin; Biocare Medical) for 10 minutes. Slides 
were then incubated in serum block for 60 minutes (10% FBS, 10% 
normal goat serum), followed by rat anti-mouse F4/80 Ab (BioLegend) 
or rat IgG2b isotype–matched control for 60 minutes. Endogenous per￾oxidase activity was blocked using 3% H2
O2
. Cells were subsequently 
incubated with a goat anti-rat biotinylated F(ab′)2
 fragment (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology Inc.), followed by HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Jack￾son ImmunoResearch). DAB was developed according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions (Dako), and all slides were counterstained with 
Mayer’s hematoxylin and mounted using permanent mounting media.
For trichrome staining, 6-μm sections were cut and incubated in 
Bouin’s solution for 15 minutes at 55°C, washed, and stained for 5 min￾utes in Weigert’s iron hematoxylin solution. Slides were washed in tap 
water, then distilled water for 5 minutes and stained for 5 minutes in 
Biebrich Scarlet-Acid Fuchsin solution (Thermo Scientific). Slides were 
subsequently washed in distilled water, stained in phosphotungstic/
phosphomolybdic acid solution for 5 minutes, aniline blue solution for 
5 minutes, and 1% acetic acid solution for 2 minutes, and washed in dis￾tilled water to remove all residue. Slides were then dehydrated through 
alcohol baths and xylene washes and coverslipped. Images were col￾lected using a BX51 light microscope (Olympus).
Frozen tissues issues were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound 
(Sakura Finetek) without prior fixation, and IHC was carried out on 7-μm 
sections fixed with 75% acetone/35% ethanol. IHC was performed as 
described above but with the addition of an endogenous avidin/biotin 
blocking step (10 minutes with avidin, 10 minutes with biotin; Vector 
Labs). Slides were then blocked in serum as described above [with an
