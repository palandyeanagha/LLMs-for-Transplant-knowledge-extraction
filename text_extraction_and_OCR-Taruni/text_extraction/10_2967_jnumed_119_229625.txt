Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major cause of graft failure
after cardiac transplantation. CAV is characterized by diffuse in￾volvement of epicardial coronary arteries and the microvasculature.
PET allows quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF)
and myocardial flow reserve (MFR), which may be accurate markers
of CAV severity. We compared the diagnostic and prognostic utility
of stress MBF and MFR after cardiac transplantation. Methods:
This was a cohort study of consecutive cardiac transplant patients
undergoing 82Rb PET scans. Semiquantitative regional analysis and
global measurement of stress MBF and MFR were performed. As￾sociations with all-cause mortality were assessed with multivariable
Cox analysis. The diagnostic accuracy for significant CAV (grade
2/3) and the prognostic accuracy of stress MBF and MFR, corrected
and uncorrected for rate–pressure product, were compared. Re￾sults: In total, 99 patients, mean age 68.8 y and 75.8% male, were
followed for a median of 3.4 y, during which 26 deaths occurred.
Stress MBF and MFR had similar diagnostic accuracy for significant
CAV. However, uncorrected MFR had improved discrimination for
all-cause mortality compared with stress MBF (area under the
curve, 0.748 vs. 0.639; P 5 0.048). Higher MFR (adjusted hazard
ratio, 0.30; P , 0.001), but not stress MBF (adjusted hazard ratio,
1.14; P 5 0. 656), was associated with reduced all-cause mortality.
Preserved MFR (.2.0) identified relatively low-risk patients (annual
mortality, 4.7%), whereas the presence of a left ventricular ejection
fraction lower than 45% and MFR lower than 1.7 identified high-risk
patients (annual mortality, 51.6%). Conclusion: Quantitative PET
analysis, and particularly MFR, has diagnostic and prognostic utility
after heart transplantation. Preserved MFR identifies low-risk pa￾tients, whereas the presence of multiple abnormal parameters iden￾tifies high-risk patients.

Heart transplantation is a definitive therapy for patients with
end-stage heart failure. Because of advances in posttransplant pa￾tient care, median posttransplant survival is now over 13 y (1). As
long-term survival has increased, the prevalence of cardiac allo￾graft vasculopathy (CAV), characterized by a diffuse arteriopathy
involving the epicardial coronary arteries and microvasculature,
has increased (2). CAV accounts for over a third of deaths in pa￾tients who survive at least 5 y after receiving the transplant and is
the most common indication for retransplantation in patients who
survive 1 y (3).
Although invasive coronary angiography and intravascular ul￾trasound have been the gold standard for diagnosing CAV, they are
associated with inherent procedural risk (4). Noninvasive monitor￾ing of CAV may provide valuable diagnostic information while
avoiding the risk of invasive studies (2). Noninvasive imaging with
stress echocardiography and SPECT have poor sensitivity for diag￾nosis of CAV (5,6). However, PET myocardial perfusion imaging
(MPI) offers the advantage of measurement of absolute myocardial
blood flow (MBF) and calculation of myocardial flow reserve (MFR).
Stress MBF and MFR provide physiologic assessments of both epi￾cardial coronary artery and coronary microvascular function (7).
Thus, PET may provide a more comprehensive assessment for CAV
than other noninvasive modalities. In previous studies, both MBF and
MFR have provided incremental diagnostic and prognostic utility in
the semiquantitative assessment of perfusion for the diagnosis of CAV
after cardiac transplantation (8–10).
Although evidence regarding the use of PET for CAV surveil￾lance has grown, it has not been adopted as standard clinical prac￾tice. Previous studies have used variable thresholds of MBF and
MFR for diagnosis of CAV. Additionally, there is no consensus on
whether MFR or stress MBF should be used as the marker for
adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Our objectives were to com￾pare the diagnostic value of MBF and MFR for detecting CAV, to
evaluate the prognostic utility of MBF and MFR for predicting
adverse outcomes, and to evaluate the performance of previously
described thresholds for 82Rb PET MPI parameters in patients
after cardiac transplantation.

PET MPI AFTER CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION • Miller et al. 249

December 2015 were identified at a single center. Patients without
dynamic data were excluded (n 5 6). In patients with multiple studies,
the first study with dynamic data was included. This study was ap￾proved by the Institutional Review Board at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center (CR00013886), and written informed consent was obtained
from all patients.
Transplant demographics were obtained from medical records. A
history of acute cellular rejection was defined as biopsy showing cel￾lular rejection of at least grade 2R or a history of treated acute cellular
rejection. A history of antibody-mediated rejection was defined as a
history of treated antibody-mediated rejection. The invasive coronary
angiography examination that most closely preceded PET was reviewed
and graded for CAV according to the International Society of Heart and
Lung Transplantation classification based on the interpretation of the
performing cardiologist, masked to the PET results (11).
Image Acquisition and Reconstruction
Patients were imaged with a whole-body PET/CT scanner (Siemens
Biograph-64 TruePoint PET/CT with the True V) (12). A 6-min list￾mode rest acquisition was performed simultaneously with injection of
925–1,850 MBq of 82Rb. Regadenoson or adenosine stress acquisi￾tions were then performed with the same protocol (13). Heart rate and
blood pressure were recorded before 82Rb injection and at peak stress.
The 6-min rest and stress data were reconstructed into a dynamic
imaging series consisting of 16 frames (12 · 10 s, 2 · 30 s, 1 ·
60 s, and 1 · 120 s) using the vendor iterative method (Fourier
rebinning 1 2-dimensional attenuation-weighted ordered-subsets
expectation maximization) with 2 iterations, 8 subsets, and an 8-mm
gaussian postprocessing filter (14). CT attenuation-correction scans
were acquired both before rest imaging and after stress imaging. Reg￾istration of the CT attenuation map with the PET images was verified
visually by an experienced technologist.
Perfusion was assessed semiquantitatively at stress and rest to de￾rive the summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS), and
summed difference score (SDS) (15). Patients were grouped according
to abnormalities: SRS ($1 or 0), 2 criteria for SSS (SSS $ 4 or , 4
and . 1 or # 1), and ischemia (SDS threshold . 1). Left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed at rest. For quantitative mea￾surements, MBF was computed from the dynamic imaging series with
dedicated software (QPET; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center) (14,16). A
standard 1-tissue-compartment model and 82Rb extraction fraction
derived from the described Renkin–Crone function was used to esti￾mate MBF from K1 (17). MFR was calculated as MBF at stress di￾vided by MBF at rest. Corrected rest MBF was calculated as MBF at
rest · rate–pressure product/10,000, and corrected MFR was calcu￾lated as stress MBF divided by corrected MFR. Rate–pressure product
was calculated as heart rate · systolic blood pressure.
Thresholds for quantitative PET analysis were based on previously
published values (MFR , 2.0 (8) or , 1.75 (9); stress MBF , 3.7 (8)
or , 1.7 (10)). Additionally, we investigated combinations of parame￾ters previously described as having prognostic value (SSS $ 4, LVEF #
45, or MFR , 1.75 (9); and MBF , 1.7 with SSS . 1 or LVEF # 45

(10)). Additionally, cutoffs were derived from the receiver-operating￾characteristic curves generated in this study using the Youden index (18).
Outcomes
The diagnostic outcome was the presence of CAV grade 2 or 3. The
primary prognostic outcome was all-cause mortality. Cardiovascular mor￾tality, the secondary prognostic outcome, was determined after review
of all available clinical information based on standard definitions (19).
No patients in our cohort underwent retransplantation. Follow-up of all
patients, including patients who transferred to alternate transplant pro￾grams, was confirmed by trained research coordinators.
Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables with normal distributions are presented as
mean 6 SD and compared with a Student t test. Continuous vari￾ables that were not normally distributed are presented as median
and interquartile range (IQR) and compared using the Mann–Whitney
U test. Categoric variables are summarized as number and proportion
and compared using a Fisher exact test.
The primary outcome was assessed using Kaplan–Meier survival
curves and compared using the log-rank test. Univariable and multi￾variable Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to identify
associations with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.
Multivariable models included variables identified as significant on
univariable analyses (P , 0.05).
Receiver-operating-characteristic curves were generated for semi￾quantitative and quantitative PET parameters. Area under the curve
(AUC) was compared using the method established by DeLong et al.
(20). Calibration of quantitative PET measurements was assessed us￾ing the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and was found to be
adequate for each combination of measurement and outcome (all P . 0.05).
Event rates were extrapolated from Cox proportional hazards mod￾els. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed with Schoen￾feld residuals for each model and found to be valid. We assessed
interactions between each of the variables in the final model, with no
significant interactions identified. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with a
P value of less than 0.05 considered significant. Analysis was performed
using JMP (version 13; SAS) and Stata (version 13; StataCorp).
RESULTS
Follow-up and All-Cause Mortality
In total, 99 patients were included. Their baseline characteris￾tics are outlined in Table 1. The mean age was 68.8 6 10.0 y, and
75 (75.8%) patients were male. Median resting heart rate was 82
(IQR, 73–90). During a median follow-up of 3.4 y (IQR, 2.2–4.0
y), 26 patients died (26.3%). The patients who died were older at
the time of PET (mean age, 74.0 vs. 66.7; P , 0.001) and had a
lower mean LVEF (56.8% vs. 65.4%, P , 0.001).
Imaging characteristics are outlined in Table 2. There were no
significant differences in SSS, SRS, or SDS between patients with
and without all-cause mortality. However, stress MBF (2.54 vs.
2.88 mL/min/g, P 5 0.024) and MFR (1.69 vs. 2.37, P , 0.001)
were lower in patients who died during follow-up.

Diagnostic Utility of 82Rb PET
Reference angiography occurred at a median of 1.0 y (IQR, 0.9–
2.0 y) before the PET study. MBF, MFR, and corrected MFR dem￾onstrated good discrimination of significant CAV. There were no
significant differences in the ability of stress MBF (AUC, 0.713),
MFR (AUC, 0.749), or corrected MFR (AUC, 0.714) to iden￾tify patients with significant CAV (Fig. 1). Optimal cutoffs in our
population were as follows: a stress MBF of less than 2.83 (sensi￾tivity, 73.1%; specificity, 56.2%), an uncorrected MFR of less than
2.22 (sensitivity, 80.8%; specificity, 61.6%), and an corrected MFR
of less than 2.19 (sensitivity, 76.9%; specificity, 65.8%). SSS alone
(AUC, 0.706) had differentiation similar to stress MBF, uncorrected
MFR, and corrected MFR. The addition of abnormal regional per￾fusion to stress MBF, corrected MFR, and uncorrected MFR did not
result in a statistically significant improvement in discrimination
of patients with CAV compared with quantitative markers alone
(Supplemental Fig. 1; supplemental materials are available at http://
jnm.snmjournals.org).
Prognostic Utility of 82Rb PET
Kaplan–Meier survival curves for semiquantitative regional
analysis are shown in Figure 2. An SSS of at least 4 (log-rank
P 5 0.017) was associated with increased all-cause mortality.
Abnormal SRS or SDS was not associated with all-cause mortal￾ity. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for quantitative PET variables
are shown in Figure 3. Abnormal MFR (log-rank P , 0.001),
corrected MFR (log-rank P , 0.001), and stress MBF (log-rank
P 5 0.002) were associated with increased all-cause mortality.
In a univariable Cox proportional hazards analysis (Table 3),
stress MBF (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% confi￾dence interval [CI], 0.35–0.90; P 5 0.017), uncorrected MFR
(unadjusted HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19–0.62; P , 0.001), and
corrected MFR (unadjusted HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26–0.74;
P 5 0.002) were associated with all-cause mortality. A higher
SSS was also associated with increased all-cause mortality
(unadjusted HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03–1.15; P 5 0.002), as were

were more likely to experience all-cause mortality during follow-up (log￾rank P 5 0.017).

age and lower LVEF. However, in a multivariable model, only age
and MFR continued to be associated with all-cause mortality (un￾corrected: adjusted HR, 0.30; P 5 0.017; corrected: adjusted HR,
0.43; P 5 0.025). The addition of uncorrected MFR significantly
improved death prediction when added to age, LVEF, SRS, SSS,
SDS, and stress MBF (x2, 6.5; P 5 0.011), with less improvement
by adding corrected MFR (x2, 5.4; P 5 0.020).
Receiver-operating-characteristic curves for prediction of all-cause
mortality are shown in Figure 4. Uncorrected MFR showed improved
discrimination for all-cause mortality compared with stress MBF
(AUC, 0.748 vs. 0.639; P 5 0.048). However, there was no signif￾icant difference in mortality prediction between MFR and corrected
MFR. Prediction of all-cause mortality with SSS alone (AUC, 0.593)
was significantly worse than with MFR (P 5 0.007) or corrected
MFR (P 5 0.019), but not stress MBF (P 5 0.435). The addition of
abnormal regional perfusion to MFR or stress MBF analyses did not
significantly improve the prognostic accuracy compared with quan￾titative markers alone (Supplemental Fig. 2).
Cardiovascular Mortality
Cardiovascular mortality occurred in 16 (16.2%) patients.
Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses
of the association with cardiovascular mortality are shown in
Supplemental Table 1. Stress MBF was associated with increased
cardiovascular mortality in univariable analysis (unadjusted HR,
0.37; P 5 0.002) but not multivariable analysis (adjusted HR, 1.08;
P 5 0.848). Uncorrected MFR was associated with increased car￾diovascular mortality in univariable analysis (unadjusted HR, 0.17;
P , 0.001) and multivariable analysis (adjusted HR, 0.05; P 5
0.001). Receiver-operating-characteristic curves for prediction of
cardiovascular mortality are shown in Supplemental Figure 3.
Comparison of Previously Described Thresholds
Table 4 summarizes the diagnostic and prognostic utility of pre￾viously described abnormal thresholds and their combinations.
Uncorrected MFR was used because discrimination was numer￾ically superior to corrected MFR in our prior analyses. With
respect to diagnosis of CAV, stress MBF performed well among
individual variables, but with restrictive thresholds. A stress MBF of
less than 3.7 had the highest sensitivity but classified 79.8% of pa￾tients as abnormal, whereas a stress MBF of less than 1.7 had the
highest specificity, with only 10.1% of patients classified as abnor￾mal. The highest overall accuracy was achieved with an MFR of
less than 2.0 or the combined marker of the presence of any SSS of
at least 4, LVEF of 45% or less, or MFR of less than 1.75. Regarding
prognosis, a stress MBF of less than 1.7 was the single predictor
that identified patients with the highest risk annualized mortality
rate (35.8%). Patients with reduced stress MBF (,1.7) and either an
SSS of more than 1 or an LVEF of 45% or less had an annual
mortality rate of 60.7%. Patients with preserved MFR ($2.0) were
at the lowest risk (annual mortality rate, 4.7%).
DISCUSSION
PET MPI with MBF quantification has been shown to improve
the diagnosis of CAV and provide incremental prognostic value in

patients after heart transplantation. However, there is no consensus
on which marker, stress MBF or MFR, should be applied for either
diagnostic or prognostic purposes (21). In this study, we demon￾strated that stress MBF, uncorrected MFR, and corrected MFR
were equivalent in discriminating patients with significant CAV.
For prognosis, we found that reduced MFR offered superior dis￾crimination for all-cause mortality, compared with stress MBF.
Finally, we found that correcting for rate–pressure product did
not improve the prognostic or diagnostic accuracy of MFR.
Our study adds to a growing body of literature describing the diag￾nostic utility of quantitative PET analysis. Bravo et al. reported that in
patients imaged by 13N-NH3 PET MPI, stress MBF and LVEF com￾bined with regional perfusion improved detection of significant CAV,
with an AUC of 0.88 compared with 0.82 (10). Konerman et al. reported
that MFR or stress MBF numerically, but not significantly, improved
discrimination of CAV compared with regional perfusion when assessed
by 82Rb PET (8). Chih et al. found that stress MBF and MFR had
similar discrimination of CAV when defined angiographically or by
intravascular ultrasound (22). In our population, stress MBF, uncorrected
MFR, and corrected MFR had comparable performance for diagnosis of
significant CAV. These results suggest that either stress MBF or MFR
may improve diagnosis of CAV and that if differences in discrimina￾tion are present, they are likely not clinically significant.
Our study also confirmed the prognostic utility of PET MPI in
patients after heart transplantation. Mc Ardle et al. followed 140
cardiac transplant patients who underwent 82Rb PET for a median
18.2 mo of follow-up, during which 14 events occurred, including 9
deaths (9). They demonstrated that MFR, but not stress MBF, was
associated with increased adverse events, with an MFR of less than
1.5 conferring a 4-fold increase in risk. Konerman et al. (8) reported
similar associations with a combined outcome of death (n 5 2), acute
coronary syndrome (n 5 5), revascularization (n 5 8), or heart failure
(n 5 15). Both studies used uncorrected MFR. We expanded on this
evidence by including a greater number of hard events and observed
that only reduced MFR was associated with increased all-cause mor￾tality in adjusted analyses. Additionally, the discriminatory value of
MFR was superior to that of stress MBF for identifying patients who
died during follow-up. Serial evaluation with PET has been shown to
further refine prognostication (23). Our findings provide evidence that
quantitative PET blood flow analysis, particularly with MFR, has
significant prognostic utility after heart transplantation.
Lastly, we describe the performance of previously described ab￾normal thresholds in our cohort. Although semiquantitative perfusion
abnormalities were associated with increased all-cause mortality, they
did not significantly improve diagnosis of CAV or prognostication
when added to stress MBF or MFR. Further, we found that preserved
MFR (defined as $2.0) identified a group of patients with the lowest
rate of all-cause mortality during follow-up. Combining reduced
LVEF with reduced MFR (or MBF) identified a group of patients
with annual mortality over 50%. Additional patients at high mortality
risk were identified by combining the presence of severely reduced
stress MBF with abnormal regional perfusion or reduced LVEF. As a

point of reference, the International Society of Heart and Lung Trans￾plantation guidelines suggest that patients with end-stage heart failure
and estimated 1-y mortality over 20% be considered for transplant
listing (24). Therefore, PET may have a role for identifying patients
who may benefit from retransplantation before they develop signifi￾cant heart failure symptoms or recurrent hospitalizations. Physicians
should integrate multiple parameters to improve diagnostic sensitivity
or risk stratification based on individual clinical scenarios.
Our study had a few important limitations. This was a retrospective
study of patients from a single center. Our sample size was small, but
it was comparable to prior studies. The patients who were referred for
PET represented a high-risk cohort as evidenced by the high annual
mortality rates. PET perfusion studies were performed as part of
routine clinical practice; therefore, the interval between invasive
coronary angiography and PET scanning was not standardized and
the delay had been over 2 y in one quarter of patients. Although this
delay may have affected the assessment of diagnostic accuracy, most
patients had received their transplant more than 10 y previously and
therefore were at a stage at which CAV tends to progress less rapidly
(2). Our use of a software package different from that in other pub￾lished studies may explain some of the variation in findings. How￾ever, the correlation across software packages is excellent (25).
Additionally, our results confirm that PET has diagnostic and prog￾nostic utility regardless of the software package used.
CONCLUSION
We confirmed the diagnostic and prognostic utility of PET flow
quantitation in posttransplant patients. Stress MBF and MFR had
similar diagnostic utility, and correcting for rate–pressure product did
not improve diagnostic or prognostic accuracy. However, we found
that uncorrected MFR was superior to stress MBF for prognostication.
Preserved MFR identifies low-risk patients, whereas the presence of
multiple abnormal parameters identifies patients at the highest risk.

KEY POINTS
QUESTION: What is the diagnostic and prognostic utility of MBF
and MFR in patients after cardiac transplantation?
PERTINENT FINDINGS: We specifically compared the perfor￾mance of MFR with and without correction for rate–pressure
product and found that uncorrected values have numerically
higher diagnostic and prognostic utility. Additionally, we showed
that stress MBF and MFR have similar diagnostic utility, whereas
uncorrected MFR has superior prediction of all-cause mortality.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: Physicians should inte￾grate multiple parameters to improve diagnostic sensitivity or risk
stratification based on individual clinical scenarios.
