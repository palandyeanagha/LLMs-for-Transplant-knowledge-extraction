ABSTRACT 
Due to the continuous exposure to a challenging environment and repeated
antibiotic treatment courses, bacterial populations in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients
experience selective pressure causing the emergence of mutator phenotypes. In this
study we investigated the genotypic diversity, mutation frequency and antibiotic
resistance of S. maltophilia isolates chronically colonizing CF patients. S. maltophilia
was isolated from a total of 90 sputum samples, collected sequentially from 19 CF
patients admitted between January 2008 and March 2012 at the University Hospital
Essen, Germany. DNA fingerprinting by repetitive-sequence-based PCR revealed
that 68.4% (n=13) of CF patients harbored different S. maltophilia genotypes during
the 4-year study course. Out of 90 S. maltophilia isolates obtained from chronically
colonized CF patients, 17.8% (n=16) were hypomutators, 27.7% (n=25),
normomutators, 23.3% (n=21), weak hypermutators and 31.2% (n=28) strong
hypermutators. We also found that mutation rates of the most clonally related
genotypes varied over time with the tendency to become less mutable. Mutator
isolates were found to have no significant increase in resistance against eight
different antibiotics versus nonmutators. Sequencing of genes mutL, mutS and uvrD
genes demonstrated the occurrence of amino acid changes in their corresponding
proteins. Here, we could demonstrate that several different S. maltophilia genotypes
are present in CF patients and as a sign of adaption their mutation status switches
over time to a less mutator phenotype without increasing resistance. These results
suggest that S. maltophilia attempts to sustain its biological fitness as mechanism for
long-term persistence in the CF lung.

Introduction
The pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by
dehydration of airway surfaces and impaired mucociliary transport. Consequently,
under conditions of increased viscosity and osmolarity, effective eradication of
pathogens in these patients does not occur, generally leading to chronic lung
colonization/infection (Rowe et al., 2005). In children, Staphylococcus aureus and
Haemophilus influenzae are the most frequently isolated pathogens, whereas adults
are often colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Hauser et al., 2011). 
Different worldwide CF centers have observed that Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia´s prevalence has increased (de Vrankrijker et al., 2010). However, there
is considerable debate about whether this pathogen is a real marker of disease
severity or if it is causally related to disease progression (Waters et al., 2011; Waters
et al., 2013). 
Since the bacterial populations in CF patients are constantly exposed to a
challenging environment and repeated antibiotic treatments, strong diversification
over time will occur, inducing the emergence of mutator phenotypes (Tenaillon et al.,
1999). In general, a mutator microorganism exhibits an increased spontaneous
mutation rate due to defects present in DNA repair and error avoidance systems
(Oliver, 2010; Oliver and Mena, 2010). Studies related to mutator prevalence in CF
patients have been mainly focused on P. aeruginosa (Oliver et al., 2000; Ciofu et al.,
2005; Henrichfreise et al., 2007; Ferroni et al., 2009), whereas data concerning other
CF pathogens is still limited (Prunier et al., 2003; Román et al., 2004; Turrientes et
al., 2010). Furthermore, hypermutation has been recognized as a key mechanism for
increasing antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa (Maciá et al., 2005; Oliver and
Mena, 2010).

The significance of chronic/ or persistent colonization of Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia in the CF airway (disease) has not been well clarified, which leads to
widely disparate views regarding the relevance of this bacterium in these patients
(Valdezate et al., 2001; Goss et al., 2004). To expand the knowledge on S.
maltophilia adaptation to CF airways, we investigated the genotypic diversity,
mutation frequency and antibiotic resistance of S. maltophilia isolates chronically
colonizing CF patients. 
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
S. maltophilia was isolated from a total of 90 sputum samples, sequentially
collected from 19 chronically colonized CF patients admitted between January 2008
and March 2012 at the University Hospital Essen, Germany. Sputum samples from
CF patients attending the University Hospital were collected from the patients as part
of standard care. Chronic colonization/infection by S. maltophilia was defined as the
persistent presence of this bacterium in 2 or more sputa within a period of 12 months
(Goncalves Vidigal et al., 2013; Valdezate et al., 2001). Isolates that grew on
selective agar medium (Goncalves Vidigal et al., 2011) were identified by oxidase
test, MicroScan® WalkAway system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and matrix￾assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay (Vitek
MS, bioMérieux, Marcy I´Etoile, France). 

5
Isolation of genomic DNA from clinical specimens
Genomic DNA extraction was performed using the UltraCleanTM microbial DNA
isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA), in accordance with the
manufacturer´s instructions. The extracted DNA was stored at - 20⁰C until
amplification was conducted.
Molecular typing by repetitive-sequence-based-PCR (rep-PCR)
Rep-PCR was carried out using the DiversiLab® bacterial DNA fingerprinting kit
(bioMérieux, Marcy I´Etoile, France), following the manufacturer´s recommendations.
Briefly, each reaction required 35ng of genomic DNA, 2.5U of AmpliTaq DNA
polymerase, and 1.5µL of 10X PCR buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Thermal
cycling parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 94⁰C for 2min, 35 cycles of
denaturation at 94⁰C for 30s, annealing at 60⁰C for 30s, extension at 70⁰C for 90s,

6
and a final round of extension at 70⁰C for 3min. Analysis of rep-PCR amplicons was
conducted by the DiversiLab system software, in which different sizes and intensities
of amplified fragments were separated by a microfluidic Labchip and detected using
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The degree
of relatedness was defined by cluster analysis, using the Pearson correlation
coefficient and UPGMA to create dendrograms. Isolates with a similarity of ≥95%
were considered as a “genotype”. We used ATCC 13637 reference strain as a quality
control. Subculture stability and reproducibility of rep-PCR results were defined by
the average similarity of >98% of three different colonies obtained at three time
points (1, 5 and 10 days). 
Mutation frequency assay
Mutation frequencies conferring rifampicin resistance were estimated as previously
described (Turrientes et al., 2010). Independent triplicate Luria Bertani (LB) broth
culture were grown overnight in an orbital incubator at 36°C with agitation (150rpm).
Aliquots (100µL) of 10-6 dilutions of the overnight cultures were inoculated onto LB￾rifampicin plates (250 mg/L), further 500µL aliquots were seeded onto LB plates.
Colony counts of LB and LB-rifampicin plates were carried out after 24h and 48h
incubation period, respectively. The mean number of mutants for each isolate was
calculated. Isolates were classified into four categories based on their mutation
frequencies: hypomutator (f ≤ 8 × 10-9), normomutator (8 × 10-9< f < 4× 10-8), weak
hypermutator (4 × 10-8< f < 4× 10-7) and strong hypermutator (f ≥ 4 × 10-7) (Turrientes
et al., 2010). 

7
PCR amplification and sequencing of mismatch repair genes from S.
maltophilia isolates 
In attempt to uncover the underlying mechanisms involved in increased mutation
frequency, five S. maltophilia strains (two hypermutators and three hypomutators)
were randomly selected for investigation. After inducing mutation with rifampicin,
genomic DNA extraction of isolates was performed as previously described. Three
primer pairs were designed to span mutL, mutS and uvrD genes (Table 2).
Amplification reactions were conducted in a 50 µL final volume containing of 1 ng of
genomic DNA, 5mM dNTP mix, 1.5 MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer, 50 µM of each primer, 2.5
Unit Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The PCR program was
carried out as follows: denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles
consisting of a denaturation step at 95 °C for 30s, 1 min at the appropriate annealing
temperature, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min.
Aliquots of PCR products were run alongside a 100 base pair DNA ladder (GE
Healthcare, Germany) on a 0.6 % gel. PCR products were purified using the
QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced using both
forward and reverse primers (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany). 
Homology searches and sequence alignments
Sequences of S. maltophilia mutL, mutS and uvrD genes were retrieved from NIH
GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to design the primers and to verify
similarities. Alignments were performed using the Clustal Omega program (Sievers et
al., 2011). Sequences of all samples were examined manually to verify for local

8
misalignment errors relative to the reference genome (S. maltophilia D457), mobile
element insertions, and large insertions and/or deletions. 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The in vitro activities of ceftazidime, colistin, co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin, levofloxacin,
moxifloxacin, tigecycline and tobramycin, against all 90 S. maltophilia isolates were
tested. Susceptibility testing was performed using MIC test strips (Liofilchem, Roseto
degli Abruzzi, Italy) and resistance breakpoints were those of Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (M07-A8). For colistin, we used the breakpoints
established for P. aeruginosa. S. maltophilia ATCC 16637 was tested for quality
assurance purposes. A suspension with adjusted density of 0.5 McFarland standard
was plated on Mueller-Hinton agar. MIC was read after incubation at 35 °C for 24 h.
According to the manufacturer's guidelines, the zone of growth inhibition that
intersected the E-test strip was interpreted as the MIC. 
Statistical analysis
Fisher´s test was used for comparison of resistance between nonmutator
(hypomutator and normomutator) and mutator (weak hypermutator and strong
hypermutator) groups. The analyses were performed with the Prism 5.0 software
package (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. 
Results

9
A total of 90 S. maltophilia isolates were collected from the sputum of 19 CF
patients considered chronically colonized. The mean age of CF patients for the onset
of chronic colonization with S. maltophilia was 25±12.8 years (range 11-65 years), of
which 52.6% of subjects were female. The mean number of sputa collected samples
per patient was 4.8 (±3.3). Mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator did not correlate with number of isolates obtained per sputa or
S. maltophilia genotype. 
To better understand the genetic structure (i.e. degree of relatedness) of S.
maltophilia population in chronically colonized CF patients, these bacterial isolates
were fingerprinted using the semi-automated, rep-PCR technique (DiversiLab®
system). Table 1 summarizes demographic and genotypic characteristics of the CF
patients, as well as the genotype characteristics of S. maltophilia isolates obtained
from these patients. Genotypic analysis of the consecutive clinical isolates
demonstrated the presence of 38 different genotypes. A total of 13 (68.4%) CF
patients harbored different S. maltophilia genotypes during the course of the study.
For example, patient 3 (Figure 1) had the highest number of diverse genotypes (n=8)
within 34 months. Patients 7, 10 and 11 showed the presence of three genotypes,
whereas patients 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 17 had only two. Our data also show that
31.6% (n=6) of these patients were colonised with unique clones (Table 1).
Interestingly, we also observed that 10 patients (1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16 and 17)
shared S. maltophilia genotypes. 
To exclude confounding factors that might alter rep-PCR banding patterns of
S. maltophilia due to increasing culture age and/or clonal expansion during growth of
multiple subcultures, stability of rep-PCR patterns were investigated. For that, three
distinguished colonies from a clinical CF isolates were collected at three different

10
time points (1, 5 and 10 days), and rep-PCR was performed. We were able to
demonstrate that the S. maltophilia genotype was subculture stable and that rep￾PCR gave reproducible results (Figure 2).
Several studies have confirmed the presence of mutators in CF patients with
chronic respiratory infection caused by different bacteria (Oliver et al., 2000; Prunier
et al., 2003; Román et al., 2004). For this reason, we carried out mutation frequency
assay to verify the mutation status of S. maltophilia isolates obtained from chronically
colonized CF patients. Of the 90 S. maltophilia isolates obtained from chronically
colonized CF patients, mutation frequency results revealed that 17.8% (n=16) were
hypomutators, 27.7% (n=25) normomutators, 23.3% (n=21) weak hypermutators and
31.2% (n=28) strong hypermutators. Eleven CF patients (57.9%) harbored at least
one strong hypermutator isolate, whereas 7 (36.9%) of them harbored at least one
hypomutator isolate. Interestingly, among the 10 patients that shared similar
genotypes, 44.4% (n=4) were colonized by strong hypermutable, 33.3% (n=3) by
weak hypermutable, and 22.2% (n=2) by normomutable and hypomutable isolates.
We further examined if these genotypes due to the selection pressure of CF airways
tended to become hypermutator. Remarkably, we noted that the mutation rates of
most clonally related genotypes varied over time (Figure 3) with tendency to become
less hypermutable, except for genotype 1. 
In attempt to ascertain which modifications and/or mutations in mutS, mutL
and uvrD genes might be responsible for the mutator phenotype, the entire sequence
of these genes from five rifampicin-treated S. maltophilia isolates (three
hypomutators and two hypermutators) were fully sequenced, and deduced amino
acid sequences were compared. No insertions or deletions that might produce
aberrant proteins in any of the sequenced genes compared with the reference

11
genome were detected. Notably, the presence of single nucleotide and double or
triple nucleotide polymorphisms in all abovementioned genes, in comparison to
reference strain, was detected in the rifampicin-treated S. maltophilia isolates. In
Table 3 are listed the double and/or triple nucleotide changes detected. Based on the
deduced amino sequences, our data demonstrated the following changes: A71P and
T213A in MutL, T575A and A576E in MutS, P139A and A411V in UvrD, which were
found in considerably highly conserved regions (Table 4). Only the amino acid
modification A411V in the UvrD protein was unique to hypermutator isolates. 
Conversely, there is a lack of study regarding the correlation of CF S.
maltophilia mutator isolates with antibiotic resistance. To evaluate the impact of the
high proportion of mutator isolates found in this study, susceptibility testing for eight
widely used antimicrobial agents was performed (Figure 4). Tigecycline and co￾trimoxazole had the best activity against S. maltophilia isolates. Interestingly, mutator
isolates were found not significantly more resistant against the antibiotics than
nonmutators (Table 5). In addition, the mean MIC of each antibiotic was not found to
be statistically different between the nonmutator and mutator isolates. 
Discussion
S. maltophilia is considered an emerging pathogen in the CF community, as a
consequence of the repeated and long-term antipseudomonal therapies (Hauser et
al., 201). Its ability to chronically colonize CF airways has been recently associated
with lower levels of lung function (Waters et al., 2011), but the importance of this
pathogen in CF patients is still debated. Not surprisingly, there is a growing interest in
investigating host-pathogen interactions responsible for progressive CF lung

12
diseases (Denton et al., 1998; Valdezate et al., 2001; Turrientes et al., 2010) in order
to gain a better understanding of the conditions required for bacterial
colonisation/persistence. 
Our data demonstrated a high degree of diversity in S. maltophilia
consecutively isolated from chronically colonized CF patients. These results are in
agreement with previous studies which used other typing methods (Denton et al.,
1998; Valdezate et al., 2001). In a study from the UK, 45 S. maltophilia CF isolates (1
single isolate from each of 40 patients and 5 isolates from a single patient) collected
during a period of 28 months were analyzed. ERIC-PCR analysis revealed the
presence of 41 different genotypes, of these, four pairs of patients shared the same
type. The five isolates that were colonizing the same patient were distinct from one
another (Denton et al., 1998). A further prospective, observational investigation at the
Hospital Ramóny Cajal CF Unit, Spain, evaluated 76 S. maltophilia isolates from 25
CF patients (Valdezate et al., 2001). A total of 62 S. maltophilia samples from 11
chronically colonised patients (44%) were recovered. Their data revealed that each
patient had one to five strains with different PFGE profiles. 
The adaptation of bacterial population to new or challenging environments
normally results in spontaneous generation of mutators (Tenaillon et al.,1999; Giraud
et al., 2001). Over the last decade, it has been extensively shown that there is a high
prevalence of P. aeruginosa mutators in chronically colonised CF patients in Spain
(37%) and Denmark (54%) (Oliver et al., 2000; Ciofu et al., 2005). In the current
study, the presence of high proportion of mutable isolates of S. maltophilia
(approximately 31%) was detected, suggesting rapid adaptation of this bacterium
population in order to survive in the CF lung airway. Previously, mutation frequency
regarding CF patients chronically colonized by S. maltophilia isolates had only

13
partially been addressed by a Spanish group (Turrientes et al., 2010). A total of 48
clinical isolates obtained from 13 CF patients (3 of them had only a single isolate)
suffering from chronic infection were analyzed. The authors observed that 16.7% of
the CF S. maltophilia isolates were strong hypermutators. 
Additionally, when investigating the genotypes shared by different CF patients
over time, we noticed that after adaptation to CF lung environment, these S.
maltophilia isolates tended to revert to the original nonmutator state. This can be
explained by the fact that accumulation of deleterious mutations may reduce bacterial
population fitness (Taddei et al., 1997). 
Increased mutation rates are commonly associated with defects in the
mismatch repair (MMR) system, especially in the gene mutS (Oliver et al., 2002;
Chopra et al., 2003; Turrientes et al., 2010). However, it is still unclear, based on the
available sequence annotation, whether the modifications mentioned are actually
relevant or responsible mutations for increasing mutation frequency in hypermutator
isolates, as we could not confirm the findings described by Turrientes et al. (2010) in
MutS. In contrast, amino acid positions 575 and 576 (usually T and A respectively)
are located in available in MutS sequences from a wide range of bacterial genera,
which is considerably highly conserved. Therefore, the sequence around these
amino acid changes is involved in ATP-binding cassette domain and it is highly
conserved among other different available sequences, it suggests that the structure
of this region is relevant for MutS activity. Therefore, the abovementioned changes
might be responsible for increasing mutation frequency, by modifying the activity of
MutS protein. 
In an additional experiment, we observed that rep-PCR did not detect
differences between the genotype profiles of normomutator and induced-strong

14
hypermutator isolates (data not shown), as it has been shown for P. aeruginosa by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (García-Castillo et al., 2012). Thus, there is
no clear correlation between changes in mutation and genotype, which might provide
information whether the strains persist or if they are newly acquired from the
environment. 
Nowadays, development of antibiotic resistance is recognized as a rising
problem resulting in limited antibiotic treatment options. Hypermutation plays a role in
the evolution of bacterial resistance (Chopra et al., 2003). Studies have
demonstrated that P. aeruginosa mutators were more frequently resistant to different
antibiotics than nonmutators isolates (Oliver et al., 2000; Ciofu et al., 2005;
Henrichfreise et al., 2007). To the best of our knowledge, this study investigated for
the first time the presence of an association between mutation frequencies in CF S.
maltophilia isolates and antibiotic resistance. However, we did not find a significantly
correlation between S. maltophilia mutators and increasing antibiotic resistance as
shown for Pseudomonas. The reason for that is mainly unclear. 
CF and non-CF patients are mainly colonized by a dominant P. aeruginosa
descendant clone (adaptive radiation), which it is recovered over the years (Oliver et
al., 2000; Maciá et al., 2005; Ciofu et al., 2005; Ferroni et al., 2009; Hogardt and
Heeseman, 2010; Oliver, 2010). Because of that, P. aeruginosa is aggressively
treated by long-term and repeated courses of antibiotics, and therefore, the selective
pressure against this pathogen is extremely high (Hauser et al., 2011). Contrary,
there is still a lack of guidelines to eradicate S. maltophilia (therapy duration and
antimicrobial agents are not well established), consequently, the selective pressure
against this pathogen might be lower (Döring et al., 2012). 
Some limitations of this study should be noted. Firstly, as a typing method we
have used rep-PCR instead of PFGE. Rep-PCR has been reported in previous

15
studies as a useful tool in the fingerprinting of S. maltophilia hospital outbreak
isolates because it showed a high adjusted Rand`s coefficient (0.697) (Fluit et al.,
2010; Overdevest et al., 2011). Secondly, we did not test the hypothesis whether
naturally hypermutable strains are associated with a biological benefit or cost for the
colonization in a host. However, bearing these facts in mind, our findings reveal
important insights that may need to be considered in future studies, especially those
involving potential hosts. 
In conclusion, our results show that S. maltophilia isolates chronically
colonizing CF patients have a high degree of diversity and are often characterized as
mutator strains with the tendency to become less mutable status. The presence of
mutator S. maltophilia strains was not associated with increase of antibiotic
resistance. Our data indicate that S. maltophilia tries to preserve its biological fitness
as mechanism for long-term persistence in the CF lung. Future studies investigating
the adaption of S. maltophilia in the host are warranted.

Figure 1. Molecular epidemiology of S. maltophilia samples isolated from
patient 3. Dendrogram, virtual gel and the similarity matrix generated by the DL
software. The gel-like image and similarity matrix exhibit the presence of 8 different
genotypes.
Figure 2. Assessment of subculture stability and reproducibility of rep-PCR. S.
maltophilia was cultivated for 1, 5 and 10 days (indicated by the first number) and
colonies from three sites (indicated by the second number) were investigated by rep￾PCR. The horizontal bar at the bottom left shows the percent similarity coefficient of
these samples. Subculture stability and reproducibility of S. maltophilia are shown by
a high index of similarity (>98%). 
Figure 3. Mutation status of the genotypes clonally related and shared among
different CF patients over time. Each black dot represents a single isolate obtained
from a patient. The black line links the isolates that share the same genotype pattern
according to rep-PCR. The similarity among isolates was established as ≥95%
according to Pearson correlation index.
Figure 4. Distribution of resistant hypomutator, normomutator, weak
hypermutator and strong hypermutator CF S. maltophilia isolates. Antibiotic
resistance was determined against ceftazidime, colistin, co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin,
levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tigecycline and tobramycin using E-test strips.
Abbreviations: CEFres - ceftazidime resistant; LEVres - levofloxacin resistant; COLres -
colistin resistant; SXTres - co-trimoxazole resistant; TGCres - tigecycline resistant;
TOBres - tobramycin resistant; MXFres – moxifloxacin resistant: FOSres - fosfomycin
resistant.
