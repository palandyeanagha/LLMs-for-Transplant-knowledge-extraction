Background: Post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) hepatic encephalopathy (HE)
can occur in up to one third of patients. In 5%, this can be refractory to optimal medical treatment and may
require shunt modification. The efficacy of shunt modification has been poorly studied.
Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of and natural history following TIPSS modification for treatment of
refractory HE.
Methods: From a dedicated database, we selected and further studied patients who had TIPSS
modification for refractory HE.
Results: Over a 14 year period, of 733 TIPSS insertions, 211(29%) patients developed HE post-TIPSS. In
38 patients, shunt modification (reduction (n = 9) and occlusion (n = 29)) was performed for refractory HE.
Indications for TIPSS were: variceal bleeding (n = 32), refractory ascites (n = 5), and other (n = 1). Child’s
grades A, B, and C were noted in 11%, 47%, and 42% of cases, respectively. HE improved in 58% of
patients and remained unchanged or worsened in 42%, with similar results for occlusions and reductions.
Following shunt modification, variceal bleeding recurred in three patients and ascites in three. Twenty five
patients have died (liver related in 15) at a median duration of 10.2 months. Three patients died due to
procedure related complications following shunt occlusions (mesenteric infarction (n = 2) and septicaemia
(n = 1)). Median survival of patients whose HE did not improve following shunt modification was 79 days
compared with 278 days in patients whose did (p,0.05). No variables independently predicted response
to shunt modification.
Conclusions: TIPSS modification is a useful option for patients with refractory HE following TIPSS insertion.
Due to the significant risk of iatrogenic complications with shunt occlusions, shunt reduction is a safer and
preferred option.
T
ransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt
(TIPSS) has been used for the management of the
complications of portal hypertension for more than 15
years. As with surgically created shunts, hepatic encephal￾opathy (HE) is an important limitation following TIPSS
insertion. The reported incidence of post-TIPSS HE varies
depending on the criteria used for diagnosis, patient
characteristics, population studied, and intensity of follow
up. New or worsened encephalopathy has been reported to
range from 17% to 46%. The factors said to be predictive of
development of post-TIPSS HE are presence of pre-TIPSS HE,
shunt diameter, age, female sex, liver disease of non alcoholic
aetiology, and severity of liver disease.1–5
Post-TIPSS HE usually responds to standard treatments,
including lactulose, elimination of precipitating factors, and
in more refractory cases non-absorbable antibiotics such as
neomycin and/or protein restriction.6 In a minority of patients
all of these measures are ineffective. This refractory HE post￾TIPSS is a challenging clinical problem, encountered by all
units performing a large numbers of TIPSS. In such patients
the available options are either liver transplantation or
percutaneous shunt modification to either reduce the
diameter or completely occlude the shunt.3 Shunt modifica￾tion reduces the percentage volume of portosystemic shunt￾ing and this can result in improvement in post-TIPSS HE.
However, the potential benefits have to be balanced against
the reported incidence of procedure related complications,
and risk of recurrence of the primary indication for TIPSS.
There is little in the literature regarding the efficacy and
safety of, and outcomes following, shunt modification and
there are no controlled studies.
We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TIPSS modification for
treatment of refractory post-TIPSS HE and to describe the
natural history and outcomes of such patients.
METHODS
Patients
Clinical data on all patients who had a TIPSS inserted in our
centre from 1991 until the present time were prospectively
collected and entered into a dedicated database. We used this
database and case notes to retrospectively obtain data on all
patients who required shunt modification for refractory HE.
TIPSS insertion and modification
Index TIPSS placement was performed by a standard
procedure described elsewhere.7 8 All patients were adminis￾tered broad spectrum antibiotics before and for at least
48 hours after the procedure.
Patients were assessed for development of HE post-TIPSS
according to the West Haven criteria.6 9 Patients who
developed new or worsened HE following TIPSS were treated
for correctable precipitants, prescribed lactulose, and in some
cases non-absorbable antibiotics such as neomycin and/or
restricted protein diet. Lactulose was not routinely adminis￾tered to patients post-TIPSS. Those patients in whom HE

remained refractory to these measures were referred for
shunt modification.
TIPSS modification for refractory HE was achieved by
either shunt occlusion or shunt reduction.
Shunt occlusion
This was achieved by transjugular intrashunt placement of an
IVC filter (LG Venatech filter; B Braun Medical, Boulogne
Cedex, France) with or without coils (fig 1). The filter reduces
the shunt lumen and prevents systemic embolisation of the
coils. Care is taken during the procedure to prevent retro￾grade embolisation of coils into the portal vein. Following the
procedure, the TIPSS gets completely occluded at varying
intervals of time due to the development of thrombus within
its lumen.
Shunt reduction
This was achieved by transjugular intrashunt placement of
either reduction stents (Angiomed, Karlsruhe, Germany)
(fig 2) or other devices. Although the intention is to reduce
the diameter of the shunt without completely occluding the
shunt, the latter is likely to occur over time due to the
development of thrombus within the lumen.
Definitions
Refractory HE
Refractory HE was defined as clinically significant HE which
persists despite optimal medical management. HE was
judged to be clinically significant if it interfered with the
day to day activities of the patient(s) and/or led to repeated
hospital admissions.
Early onset refractory HE
Early onset refractory HE refers to patients who developed
refractory HE within six months of TIPSS insertion.
Late onset refractory HE
Late onset refractory HE refers to patients who developed
refractory HE more than six months post-TIPSS.
Responders
Patients were regarded as responders where there was a
clinically significant improvement in HE following TIPSS
modification. No routine ultrasound or angiographic TIPSS
assessment was performed.
Non-responders
Patients were regarded as non-responders where there was
no improvement in HE following TIPSS modification. In such
patients, flow through the TIPSS was reassessed by Doppler
ultrasonic examination. If persistent significant flow was
found, a further attempt to modify the TIPSS lumen was
made, usually by insertion of stainless steel coils.
Follow up
Doppler ultrasonography was performed within a week of
TIPSS insertion with portography if indicated. Portography
for assessment of shunt function was carried out routinely at
six monthly intervals thereafter, or at other times if clinically
indicated. Following shunt modification, improvement in HE
was assessed clinically over a period of time. This was done
either during the inpatient stay or in follow up outpatient
visits at three or six monthly intervals. Data were collected on
the patients until they were last seen, had a liver transplant,
or died.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are provided as the mean (SD), median
(range), or percentage for quantitative and qualitative
variables, respectively. The Student’s t test and x2 test were
used for statistical comparisons between the groups (respon￾ders and non-responders, early and late onset HE). A p value
, 0.05 was taken as significant. The actuarial probability of
survival of the two groups (responders and non-responders)
was calculated via Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the two curves
were compared using log rank statistics. Cox regression
analysis was used to determine the association between
factors and response to shunt modification. Statistical
analysis was performed using SSPS version 11.5 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, Illinois, USA).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics (table 1)
From July 1991 to September 2005, the TIPSS procedure was
undertaken in 733 patients. A total of 211 (29%) patients
developed HE post-TIPSS. Thirty eight (18%) of these
patients had refractory HE necessitating shunt modification
(5% of all TIPSS). Median follow up following shunt
modification was four months (1 day to 73 months).
In the majority of these patients, HE ranged from grade 2
to 3 and was thought to be related solely to the TIPSS. In 11
patients, additional precipitants for HE were identified and
adequately treated (constipation (n = 5), infection (n = 4),

hypokalaemia (n = 1) and gastrointestinal bleeding from a
duodenal ulcer (n = 1)). HE was thought to be related to
TIPSS if it persisted despite these measures.
Nine patients (24%) had HE prior to TIPSS. In five, this
was related to variceal bleeding and it ranged in severity from
grade 3 to 4. Twenty four (63%) patients developed early
onset refractory HE. Fourteen patients developed late onset
refractory HE.
TIPSS procedure and modification
At index TIPSS, uncovered stents were used in 31 and
covered stents in seven patients (Viator Gore (WL Gore and
Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) in six and Jostent
(Jomed, Beringen, Switzerland) in one). Table 2 shows data
regarding the index TIPSS and TIPSS modification. Following
TIPSS creation, 48 modifications were performed at a median
of 10 months (seven days to 72 months), with more than one
procedure in nine patients. In six patients, TIPSS was
modified within 30 days of TIPSS insertion. TIPSS occlusion
was performed in 29 patients and TIPSS reduction in nine
patients (reduction stents in six and other devices in three)
depending on the shunt modification devices available.
Hepatic encephalopathy
Overall, HE improved in 15 patients following shunt
occlusion and in six patients following shunt reduction
procedure.
Following shunt occlusion (n = 29), HE improved in 13
patients after the initial procedure. Five patients who did not
respond to the initial procedure had evidence of a patent
shunt on ultrasonic examination and underwent a further
procedure. The subsequent procedure resulted in resolution
of HE in two further patients. Of the remaining 14 patients,
two patients died within 48 hours of the procedure due to
procedure related complications. Five other patients died and
one had a liver transplant at a median interval of 17 days
after TIPSS occlusion. In four patients, who were non-liver
transplant candidates, further intervention was not consid￾ered appropriate as the prognosis of these patients was
considered to be extremely poor. Two patients died due to
stroke before the improvement in HE could be assessed and
were excluded from the analysis regarding response to shunt
modification. These patients however were included in the
survival analysis as non-responders.
Following shunt reduction (n = 9), HE improved in three
patients after the initial procedure. Of the six patients in
whom HE did not respond to the initial procedure, a further
procedure was performed in four patients (occlusion using
coils in three and reduction stent in one). This led to an
improvement in HE in three further patients. In the patient
whose HE did not improve despite a second procedure, the
persistently altered mental state was attributed to a
combination of HE and organic brain damage due to alcohol
and no further attempts at shunt reduction were made. A
further shunt reduction was not attempted in two of the non￾responders to the initial procedure. One of these patients died
within five days of the reduction procedure due to
septicaemia and liver failure. For the other patient, a decision
was made not to undertake any further procedures and the
patient was put on a waiting list for liver transplant. The
patient subsequently received a liver transplant five months
after the shunt reduction procedure.
Overall, shunt modification resulted in resolution of HE in
21 (58%) patients within a year of the final procedure. HE

recurred after initial improvement in two patients at 15 and
40 months following shunt modification and this was
managed by medical treatment. HE did not improve or
worsened in 15 (42%) patients.
Following Cox regression analysis, none of the pre-shunt
modification variables such as age, sex, Child Pugh score,
aetiology of liver disease, indication for TIPSS, whether TIPSS
was inserted for refractory bleeding (n = 17) or for prophy￾laxis of rebleeding (n = 15), presence of pre-TIPSS HE, early
versus late onset refractory HE, shunt diameter, type of
shunt, or type of shunt modification independently predicted
the response to shunt modification. Table 3 shows the
characteristics of responders to shunt modification versus
non-responders.
Recurrence of primary indication
Variceal rebleeding
Of the 32 patients where the primary indication for TIPSS
insertion was variceal bleeding, endoscopic treatment of
varices was performed before shunt modification in 18 and
after in two. Four patients with isolated gastric varices did
not have endoscopic treatment. Embolisation of varices at the
time of TIPSS modification was performed in 15 patients, six
of whom had gastric varices.
Variceal bleeding recurred in three of 32 (9%) patients
following shunt modification. In two Child’s C patients
(shunt reduction in one and shunt occlusion in one) this
occurred within 24 hours of the TIPSS modification. In the
first patient, variceal bleeding occurred despite apparent
eradication of varices in a variceal band ligation (VBL)
programme prior to shunt modification. Following successful
control of bleeding with VBL, further investigation revealed
that the patient had developed portal and superior mesenteric
vein thrombosis following TIPSS occlusion and probably had
developed varices due to that. The patient subsequently died
due to intestinal infarction developing within 48 hours of
TIPSS occlusion. In the second patient, who had not
undergone endoscopic treatment for varices prior to shunt
reduction, recurrent oesophageal variceal bleeding was
controlled with VBL. However, despite subsequent regular
VBL, the patient rebled from varices 38 days after TIPSS
modification. This necessitated a repeat TIPSS insertion. The
patient subsequently remained free of HE and variceal
bleeding but died 17 months later of a chest infection and
septicaemia. The third patient (Child’s B; shunt reduction)
developed refractory HE immediately post-TIPSS. Gastric
varices had been embolised at the time of TIPSS. A reduction
stent inserted for refractory HE 12 days post-TIPSS did not
produce any improvement in HE. Subsequent shunt occlu￾sion using coils led to initial resolution of HE but
unfortunately the patient rebled from varices and died of
liver failure on the day following the procedure.
Recurrent ascites
Following shunt modification, ascites recurred in three
(occlusion in two and reduction in one) of the five patients
(60%). In the first patient, the initial shunt reduction failed to
resolve HE. Further shunt modification resolved the HE but
led to recurrence of ascites. The patient subsequently
succumbed to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis seven months
after the TIPSS modification. The second patient required
repeated hospital admissions for paracentesis of problematic
ascites following shunt occlusion. The third patient developed
intractable HE immediately after index TIPSS insertion
necessitating shunt modification after seven days.
Unfortunately, there was no improvement in HE and the
ascites has worsened. The patient, who is not a transplant
candidate, now has severe hepatorenal failure with an
extremely poor prognosis. Of the two patients in whom
ascites did not recur, one had a liver transplant four months
after TIPSS modification and the other remained free of
ascites and died of medical causes 75 months after shunt
modification.
Survival
Of the 38 patients who had shunt modification, 25 have died
(15 liver related, three due to procedure related complica￾tions) following shunt modification at a median duration of
seven months (one day to 54 months). Eight patients died
within a week of the procedure (liver related in four,
mesenteric infarction in two, other causes in two).
Following shunt modification, four patients (two responders
and two non-responders) have been transplanted for liver
failure at a median duration of four months (two days to five
months). One patient was transplanted within a week of
final TIPSS modification. Of the patients who survived
without transplant (n = 9), two were well when last seen,
two require repeated hospital admissions for recurrent
ascites, one has severe liver and renal failure, and four have
various other medical problems (chronic renal failure (n = 1),

recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (n = 1), temporal
lobe disorder (n = 1), and haematological disorder (n = 1)) .
Median survival of non-responders (n = 15) was 78 days
compared with 278 days in responders (p,0.05) (fig 3).
Cumulative survival of responders versus non-responders at
six weeks and six months were 91% versus 40% and 80%
versus 27%, respectively. The majority of non-responders
either died (nine from liver failure, two from iatrogenic
complications, one from medical causes) or required liver
transplantation (n = 2). Only one of the non-responders was
alive at the time of study, but was very ill with terminal liver
and renal failure.
Median survival of patients following the shunt modifica￾tion procedure did not appear to differ whether the patients
had undergone a reduction or an occlusion procedure
(62 days for reduction versus 71 days for occlusion) (fig 4,
non-significant by log rank statistic). Cumulative survival
rates of patients who underwent occlusion versus reduction
at six weeks and six months were 62% versus 100% and 49%
versus 75%, respectively. However, the numbers involved are
too small to make any valid conclusions.
Median survival without transplantation in patients with
early onset refractory HE following TIPSS insertion was 80
(1–2177) days compared with 399 (5–1921) days in patients
with late onset refractory HE. Sixteen deaths (eight liver
related) and three transplants occurred in the early HE group
compared with nine deaths (liver related in seven and
procedure related complications in two) and one transplant
in the late onset HE group.
Complications
Three patients (all shunt occlusions) died due to procedure
related complications within a week of shunt modification.
These patients developed hypotension within hours of TIPSS
occlusion. The first patient presented with oesophageal
variceal bleeding, which had occurred despite apparently
successful eradication of varices after VBL programme prior
to TIPSS occlusion. Despite control of variceal bleeding with
VBL, the patient continued to be hypotensive and developed
metabolic acidosis. On computed tomography scan of the
abdomen, the patient was found to have an occlusive
thrombus extending from TIPSS into the superior mesenteric
and portal vein with intestinal infarction. This led to the
demise of the patient within 48 hours of the procedure. The
second patient had changes suggestive of severe gut conges￾tion with diffuse ooze from gut mucosa, on both gastroscopy
and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Although no post mortem was
performed, it is believed that this patient also died of
mesenteric infarction as a consequence of mesenteric venous
thrombosis developing after TIPSS occlusion. The third
patient developed septicaemia and septic shock within hours
of shunt modification, which set the chain of terminal events
of liver failure and hepatorenal syndrome and death.
DISCUSSION
Where medical treatment for refractory hepatic encephal￾opathy is unsuccessful, available options are either orthotopic
liver transplantation for suitable candidates or percutaneous
shunt modification of the existing TIPSS. In this series, the
largest reported to date, we describe 38 patients (5% of all
patients who had a TIPSS) who underwent shunt modifica￾tion for refractory HE. This is in keeping with the incidence of
post-TIPSS refractory HE quoted in the literature.3 10 The
majority of these patients were not transplant candidates,
and shunt modification was the only remaining therapeutic
option available. The only apparent factor which may have
contributed to the higher incidence of refractory HE in this
group may be the greater age of these patients. (median age
63 (cf mean age of 54.1 (0.6) years of patients undergoing
TIPSS at our centre)).5 Other factors such as presence or
absence of pre-TIPSS HE (24% v 29%) or final PPG post￾TIPSS were not different in this cohort compared with other
patients undergoing TIPSS at our centre (6.9 (3.2) v 7.2
(0.2))5 or that reported in the literature.11
Overall, shunt modification resulted in an improvement in
HE in 58% of patients. There was a high incidence of
procedure related complications following shunt occlusion.
Summarising the data from the published case series
(table 4) and case reports,12–27 TIPSS modification for
refractory HE has been performed in 33 patients (23
reduction and 14 occlusion procedures), with four patients
undergoing more than one procedure. The underlying
indication for TIPSS insertion was variceal bleeding in 25
and refractory ascites in eight. When we compared our data
with the cumulative data from the literature, overall efficacy
of shunt modification in our centre was lower (58% cf 71%).
The reason for this is not clear but within the limits of a
retrospective study our figures are likely to be more accurate
on account of the larger sample size and duration of follow
up. If the patients who died or had a transplant within a
week of the TIPSS modification (n = 9) were excluded (that
is, those patients in whom the response could not be
ascertained due to these events), 70% of the patients
responded to shunt modification, which is similar to the
cumulative efficacy reported in the literature. We could not
find any factors which independently predicted response to
shunt modification. This is disappointing as such a parameter
would be a very useful clinical tool. Perhaps a larger sample
size may have helped. A noteworthy observation is that early
onset refractory HE (within six months of TIPSS insertion) or
failure of HE to improve following shunt modification were
associated with a poor prognosis, with .80% mortality
without a transplant in the latter group. The extremely poor
prognosis of this subgroup suggests that alternative treat￾ment strategies in this subgroup need to be developed.
Variceal bleeding recurred in three (9.3%) patients follow￾ing shunt modification, requiring repeat TIPSS insertion in
two patients. Thus the risk of recurrence of variceal bleeding

following shunt modification appears to be low and is similar
to the risk of variceal rebleeding after index TIPSS insertion.
This risk could be further minimised if varices were
eradicated in a VBL programme before the procedure, as
only one of the 18 patients in such a programme developed
recurrent variceal bleeding. Intuitively, it may seem that once
a patient has a functioning TIPSS in situ, it would not be
possible to perform VBL. But we have found, on the basis of a
previous randomised controlled study,28 that varices in such
patients often appear collapsed and therefore require suction
for their size to be appreciated and to allow VBL to be
performed.
Following shunt modification, ascites recurred in three
(60%) patients. It is of concern that one of these patients
developed and died of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. It
seems that TIPSS modification, where ascites was the
primary indication for TIPSS, has to be performed after very
careful consideration due to the higher risk of recurrence of
ascites, and should probably be avoided in transplant
candidates. Recurrence of the primary indication (variceal
bleed or ascites) did not appear to depend on the type of
shunt modification performed. Our findings are similar to
those published in the literature where variceal bleeding
recurred in two (8%) and ascites recurred in five (62.5%)
following TIPSS modification.12–22 25–27
An important finding in our study is the high incidence of
procedure related complications following shunt occlusion.
This led to three (9.3%) deaths, two of which were due to
intestinal infarction (one suspected, one proven) due to
development of mesenteric venous thrombosis following
TIPSS occlusion. Indeed, extension of thrombus from
occluded TIPSS into the main portal vein has also been
reported in the literature.17 Paz-Fumagalli and colleagues24
reported the death of a patient following intentional TIPSS
occlusion using a Greenfield filter and coils. Their patient had
become hypotensive immediately after the procedure and had
developed progressive abdominal distension and metabolic
acidosis prior to death. Although their patient did not have a
post mortem examination and the death attributed to sudden
severe haemodynamic alterations developing immediately
after TIPSS occlusion, it is quite possible that their patient
had suffered a fatal complication similar to our patients.
Other complications reported in the literature, namely
balloon rupture and balloon displacement, have mainly been
reported with TIPSS occlusions. Based on the data available,
shunt reduction rather than occlusion should be the
preferred option of shunt modification. However, specifically
designed reduction stents are not readily available, which
limits the options available. Also, the response to shunt
reduction is unpredictable and it is tempting to attribute a
suboptimal clinical response to inadequate shunt reduction
with a further attempt(s) at shunt modification increasing
both the risk of procedural complications and the treatment
costs in a group of patients with poor long term prognosis.
Thus refractory HE post-TIPSS is a challenging clinical
problem for which we do not have an optimal solution.
A limitation of this study was its retrospective design.
However, data on patients with TIPSS was prospectively and
rigorously collected. For this study, carefully defined criteria
for patient inclusion and outcomes were used, to minimise
interpretive biases. Thus, as far as possible, efforts were taken
to minimise any confounding variables. It is important to add
that this study examined a very rare intervention and it
would be difficult to conduct studies to prospectively evaluate
shunt modification.
In conclusion, we have shown that TIPSS modification
may be a useful option for patients with refractory HE
following TIPSS insertion, particularly for those not con￾sidered transplant candidates. However, it is associated with
a relatively frequent risk of complications, and of recurrence
of the primary indication for TIPSS, particularly ascites. To
minimise the risk of recurrence of variceal bleeding, varices
should be treated endoscopically before shunt modification.
Shunt reduction should be the preferred option of shunt
modification to minimise procedure related complications.
Poor response to shunt modification is associated with a
worse outcome, and alternative strategies for this group need
to be developed, especially where patients are not transplant
candidates.

Clinical Evidence—Call for contributors
Clinical Evidence is a regularly updated evidence-based journal available worldwide both as
a paper version and on the internet. Clinical Evidence needs to recruit a number of new
contributors. Contributors are healthcare professionals or epidemiologists with experience in
evidence-based medicine and the ability to write in a concise and structured way.
Areas for which we are currently seeking contributors:
N Pregnancy and childbirth
N Endocrine disorders
N Palliative care
N Tropical diseases
We are also looking for contributors for existing topics. For full details on what these topics
are please visit www.clinicalevidence.com/ceweb/contribute/index.jsp
However, we are always looking for others, so do not let this list discourage you.
Being a contributor involves:
N Selecting from a validated, screened search (performed by in-house Information
Specialists) epidemiologically sound studies for inclusion.
N Documenting your decisions about which studies to include on an inclusion and exclusion
form, which we keep on file.
N Writing the text to a highly structured template (about 1500-3000 words), using evidence
from the final studies chosen, within 8-10 weeks of receiving the literature search.
N Working with Clinical Evidence editors to ensure that the final text meets epidemiological
and style standards.
N Updating the text every 12 months using any new, sound evidence that becomes available.
The Clinical Evidence in-house team will conduct the searches for contributors; your task is
simply to filter out high quality studies and incorporate them in the existing text.
If you would like to become a contributor for Clinical Evidence or require more information
about what this involves please send your contact details and a copy of your CV, clearly
stating the clinical area you are interested in, to CECommissioning@bmjgroup.com.
Call for peer reviewers
Clinical Evidence also needs to recruit a number of new peer reviewers specifically with an
interest in the clinical areas stated above, and also others related to general practice. Peer
reviewers are healthcare professionals or epidemiologists with experience in evidence-based
medicine. As a peer reviewer you would be asked for your views on the clinical relevance,
validity, and accessibility of specific topics within the journal, and their usefulness to the
intended audience (international generalists and healthcare professionals, possibly with
