Abstract
Background: Clinical studies suggest that inhaled corticosteroids
reduce exacerbations and improve health status in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, their effect on
mortality is unknown.
Methods: A pooled analysis, based on intention to treat, of
individual patient data from seven randomised trials (involving
5085 patients) was performed in which the effects of inhaled
corticosteroids and placebo were compared over at least 12 months
in patients with stable COPD. The end point was all-cause mortality.
Results: Overall, 4% of the participants died during a mean follow
up period of 26 months. Inhaled corticosteroids reduced all-cause
mortality by about 25% relative to placebo. Stratification by
individual trials and adjustments for age, sex, baseline post-
bronchodilator percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1
second, smoking status, and body mass index did not materially
change the results (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.73; 95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.96). Although there was
considerable overlap between subgroups in terms of effect sizes, the
beneficial effect was especially noticeable in women (adjusted HR
0.46; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.91) and former smokers (adjusted HR 0.60;
95% CI 0.39 to 0.93).
Conclusions: Inhaled corticosteroids reduce all-cause mortality in
COPD. Further studies are required to determine whether the
survival benefits persist beyond 2–3 years.
