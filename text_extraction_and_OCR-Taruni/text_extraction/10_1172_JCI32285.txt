The molecular mechanisms of acute lung injury resulting in inflammation and fibrosis are not well estab￾lished. Here we investigate the roles of the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) and the common adaptor for Toll/IL-1R
signaltransduction, MyD88, in this process using a murine model of acute pulmonary injury.Bleomycin insult
results in expression of neutrophil and lymphocyte chemotactic factors, chronic inflammation, remodeling,
and fibrosis. We demonstrate that these end points were attenuated in the lungs of IL-1R1– and MyD88-defi￾cient mice. Further, in bone marrow chimera experiments, bleomycin-induced inflammation required pri￾marily MyD88 signaling from radioresistant resident cells. Exogenous rIL-1β recapitulated a high degree of
bleomycin-induced lung pathology, and specific blockade of IL-1R1 by IL-1 receptor antagonist dramatically
reduced bleomycin-induced inflammation. Finally, we found thatlung IL-1β production and inflammation in
response to bleomycin required ASC, an inflammasome adaptor molecule.In conclusion, bleomycin-induced
lung pathology required the inflammasome and IL-1R1/MyD88 signaling, and IL-1 represented a critical effec￾tor of pathology and therapeutic target of chronic lung inflammation and fibrosis.
Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal inter￾stitial pneumonitis of unknown cause characterized by sequential 
episodes of acute lung injury with subsequent scarring, leading 
ultimately to respiratory failure, and no effective therapy is avail￾able (1). IPF is characterized by alveolar epithelial injury and hyper￾plasia, inflammatory cell accumulation, fibroblast proliferation, 
and deposition of extracellular matrix with fibrotic lesions. Bleo￾mycin-induced (BLM-induced) inflammation and fibrosis repre￾sent an experimental model for IPF. BLM induces oxidative stress, 
DNA damage, and apoptosis of alveolar macrophages and epithe￾lial cells, leading to chemokine and proinflammatory cytokine 
secretion, inflammatory cell recruitment, remodeling, and lung 
fibrosis (2, 3). Tissue injury and acute inflammatory responses 
lead in human and mouse models to an abnormal repair process 
with dysregulation of the balance between MMPs and their inhibi￾tors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), resulting 
in degradation of extracellular matrix components and accumu￾lation of collagen with progression to pulmonary fibrosis (4–6). 
Chronic inflammation and/or the profibrotic cytokine network 
activate proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, producing 
MMPs and TIMPs and resulting in disruption of alveolar structure 
and loss of lung function (7). Circulating fibrocytes derived from 
bone marrow progenitor cells also contribute to the pathogenesis 
of pulmonary fibrosis (8, 9).
The molecular mechanisms leading to lung injury and inflam￾mation are largely unknown. The degradation of the extracellular 
matrix components, such as hyaluronan, collagens may be 
involved in triggering of the inflammatory response as endoge￾nous danger signals. Hyaluronan activates macrophages, dendritic 
and endothelial cells mediated through TLR4 (10–12) and TLR2 
engagement (13). In vivo, hyaluronan was proposed to regulate 
injury and repair upon BLM administration, through TLR2, TLR4, 
and MyD88 signaling (14). Other hypotheses for the inflamma￾tory response upon lung injury include the formation of elastin 
degradation products with chemotactic function (15, 16) or the 
release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α or IL-1 (2).
Apoptosis is a crucial step in induction of inflammation and 
fibrosis, which is mediated by Fas-FasL signaling (17), activat￾ing caspase-1 and -3 and leading to production of cytokine and 
chemokines (18). Activation of inflammatory caspases in the 
inflammasome complex is an essential step for the processing 
and maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18, 
and IL-33 in response to microbial, stress, or danger signals (19). 
Upon activation, the inflammasome is formed by a member of the 
NALP protein family, such as NALP1, NALP2, or NALP3, and the 
adaptor protein ASC that connects the NALP with caspase-1 (20). 
Signals and mechanisms leading to inflammasome activation are 
still poorly understood. The inflammasome is fundamental for 
microbial detection (19). However, recent findings have demon￾strated that the inflammasome is proficient in sensing stress or 
endogenous danger signals such as extracellular ATP, hypotonic 
stress, or toxins associated with cell injury (21, 22). IL-1β is a proin￾flammatory cytokine produced by activated macrophages and epi￾thelial cells, inducing the production of chemokines, TNF-α, IL-6, 
or MMPs with neutrophil recruitment and fibroblast proliferation 
(23–25), features that are closely associated with chronic inflam￾Nonstandard abbreviations used: BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; BALF, BAL fluid;

mation and structural changes observed in the lungs of patients 
with chronic fibrotic lung disease (24). IL-1 family members alter 
the host response to an inflammatory, infectious, or immunologi￾cal challenge (26, 27). The best known members of this family are 
IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and IL-18. IL-1α, 
IL-1β, and IL-18 are highly inflammatory cytokines, and dysregu￾lation of their expression can lead to severe pathological effects. 
IL-1β is produced as an inactive cytoplasmic precursor (pro-IL-1β, 
p35) that must be cleaved to generate the mature active form 
(p17). The IL-1β–converting enzyme, better known as caspase-1, is 
required for this cleavage (28). IL-1 ligands typically bind to a cel￾lular receptor complex consisting of IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) and 
IL-1 receptor accessory protein, with IL-1Ra acting as a natural 
antagonist of IL-1α/β by trapping IL-1R1 molecules (26).
To further investigate the potential involvement of the innate 
immune recognition by the TIR family (29, 30) in response to BLM 
injury and development of chronic inflammation and fibrosis, 
we studied the role of the MyD88 adaptor protein, the common 
adaptor of IL-1R1, IL-18R, 
and most TLR signaling path￾ways, in a series of relevant 
gene-deficient mice. We report 
here that BLM-induced acute 
lung inflammation, remod￾eling, and fibrosis depended 
on IL-1R1 and MyD88 signal￾ing, whereas TLR2, TLR4, and 
IL-18R were dispensable. Fur￾ther, neutralization of IL-1β by 
antibody or specific blockage 
of IL-1R1 antagonist reduced 
BLM-induced pathology, sug￾gesting a critical role of IL-1 
and underlining the potential 
for such therapies to be effec￾tive in pulmonary interstitial 
diseases. Finally, acute cellular 
inflammation and IL-1β pro￾duction in response to BLM are 
dependent upon the adaptor 
protein ASC, which is essen￾tial for the inflammasome 
function. These findings pro￾vide insights into the molecu￾lar processes underlying the 
inflammatory conditions of 
BLM-induced lung fibrosis 
and further support a pivotal 
role of the inflammasome in 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
and lung injury diseases.
Results
Neutrophil and lymphocyte recruit￾ment in the bronchoalveolar space 
are MyD88 and IL-1R1 depen￾dent. MyD88, a critical adaptor 
molecule for most members of 
the TLR/IL-1R family, has been 
reported to be involved in TLR￾mediated acute lung inflammation (14, 31). To further analyze the 
implications of the different MyD88-dependent pathways in acute 
lung injury, we evaluated the airway inflammatory cell response 
by enumerating the cells recruited in the bronchoalveolar lavage 
fluid (BALF) after i.n. BLM administration. Total cell counts 
were increased at days 1, 7, and 11 upon BLM administration in 
C57BL/6 mice but were lower in MyD88–/– and IL-1R1–/– mice (Fig￾ure 1A). BLM elicited acute neutrophil recruitment in C57BL/6 
mice within 24 hours, which persisted over 7 days and normalized 
on day 11 (Figure 1B) and was largely reduced in the absence of 
MyD88 and IL-1R1. Lymphocyte counts were augmented at days 
7 and 11 in WT mice but were significantly lower in MyD88–/– and 
IL-1R1–/– mice (Figure 1C). Alveolar macrophages recovered in 
BALF were augmented at day 11 in WT, but not in MyD88–/– or 
IL-1R1–/– mice, although the difference did not reach statistical 
significance (Figure 1D). Therefore, BLM-induced neutrophil and 
lymphocyte influx into the bronchoalveolar space is dependent 
upon IL-1R1/MyD88 signaling.
Figure 1
Reduced neutrophil and lymphocyte recruitment in the bronchoalveolar space of BLM-challenged MyD88–/–
and IL-1R1–/– mice. (A) Total cell counts were augmented at day 1 in BLM-treated WT (B6) mice (15 mg/kg 
i.n.) and further increased at days 7 and 11 after BLM administration in WT mice, but less so in MyD88–/– and 
IL-1R1–/– mice. (B) Neutrophils were recruited into BALF in WT mice within 24 hours, persisted over 7 days, 
and normalized on day 11, while only few neutrophils were detected in the absence of MyD88 or IL-1R1. 
(C) Lymphocytes were found in BALF at day 7 and persisted until day 11 in WT mice and were less promi￾nent in MyD88–/– and IL-1R1–/– mice. (D) Alveolar macrophages were augmented at day 11 in WT but not 
MyD88–/– or IL-1R1–/– mice. Data are from 1 experiment representative of 3 independent experiments (n = 4 
mice per group; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).

BLM-induced neutrophil recruitment in the lung is TLR2, -3, -4, and -9 
independent. Since neutrophil recruitment was abrogated in the 
absence of MyD88, the common adaptor of TLRs, we investigated 
the role of individual TLRs in BLM-induced acute lung inflam￾mation. Mice deficient for TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, as well as TLR3, 
the only MyD88-independent TLR, showed abundant neutrophil 
recruitment 24 hours after BLM administration, with no signifi￾cant difference in comparison with WT mice (Supplemental Fig￾ure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI32285DS1). These data demonstrate that the TLRs 
tested are dispensable for MyD88-mediated acute neutrophil influx 
into bronchoalveolar space. To exclude a potential compensation of 
TLR2 and TLR4, we tested double TLR2/4-deficient mice and found 
no significant difference from C57BL/6 mice (Supplemental Fig￾ure 1B). Identical results were obtained in the absence of the com￾mon adaptor protein for TLR2 and -4, TIRAP, using TIRAP-defi￾cient mice (data not shown). We further examined myeloperoxidase 
(MPO) activity (Supplemental Figure 1C), expression of neutrophil 
chemotactic factor keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and IL-6 
(Supplemental Figure 1, D and E), and expression of thymus activa￾tion–regulated chemokine (TARC), a lymphocyte chemotactic fac￾tor (Supplemental Figure 1F), in the lung after BLM-induced lung 
injury. No significant difference in lung MPO, KC, IL-6, or TARC 
responses between TLR2/4-deficient and C57BL/6 mice was found. 
Similar data were obtained for KC, IL-6, and TARC levels in BALF 
(data not shown). These data demonstrate that TLR-deficient mice, 
and in particular double TLR2/4-deficient mice, are not protected 
from BLM-induced lung inflammation, in contrast to MyD88-defi￾cient mice. Therefore, the resistance of MyD88-deficient mice to 
BLM-induced lung injury appears to be TLR independent, leaving 
IL-1R–related signaling as a potential pathogenic pathway.
Reduced acute inflammation induced by BLM in IL-1R1– but not in 
IL-18R–deficient mice. Acute stress and injury may activate the inflam￾masome promoting the processing and secretion of proinflamma￾tory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-18 (32, 33), and IL-1 is increased 
upon BLM injury (34). Since resistance of MyD88-deficient mice 
to BLM-induced lung injury was TLR independent, we studied fur￾ther the implication of the IL-1R family in BLM-induced acute lung 
injury. In fact, IL-1R1–deficient mice display a dramatic reduction 
of neutrophil recruitment into the bronchoalveolar space at day 1 
after BLM administration (Figure 2A). Pulmonary MPO activity at 
day 7 was elevated only in C57BL/6 mice but in neither IL-1R1– nor 
MyD88-deficient mice (Figure 2B). No neutrophils were found in 
either mouse group after saline administration.
Since IL-1 and TNF-α share proinflammatory properties, we 
investigated the participation of TNF-α, a cytokine that does not 
use the MyD88 adaptor protein for signaling, using TNF-α–defi￾cient mice (35). The inflammatory response of TNF-α–deficient 
mice to BLM was not significantly different from that of C57BL/6 
mice in terms of increased total cell influx into BALF, induced 
neutrophil influx into BALF and lung, or KC- and IL-6–enhanced 
production in lung, suggesting that TNF-α is dispensable for the 
inflammatory response to BLM (Supplemental Figure 2, A–E).
Further, IL-1β is produced in the lung upon BLM administra￾tion (Figure 2D), while IL-18 was not detectable by ELISA (data 
not shown). IL-1 and IL-18 signal through IL-1R1 and IL-18R, 
respectively, which belong to the IL-1 receptor subfamily and use 
the adaptor MyD88 protein (36). To exclude any contribution by 
the IL-18R pathway in the MyD88-dependent BLM-induced lung 
injury, we investigated the response of IL-18R–/– mice. Unlike 
IL-1R1–/– and MyD88–/– mice, IL-18R–/– mice responded with a 
strong neutrophil influx to BLM (Figure 2C). Therefore, IL-18R 
is dispensable for acute neutrophil influx into the bronchoalveo￾lar space, showing that IL-1R1, but not IL-18R, signaling is criti￾cal in the MyD88-mediated pulmonary inflammatory response 
to BLM injury.
Figure 2
Reduced BLM-induced acute lung inflammation in IL-1R1– and MyD88-deficient mice. IL-1R1– and MyD88-deficient mice showed reduced 
neutrophil recruitment in BALF (A) and lung tissue (B), whereas IL-18R–deficient mice had neutrophil counts comparable to WT mice (C). BALs 
were performed 24 hours after BLM instillation (15 mg/kg), and MPO activity was analyzed at day 7. IL-1β (D), KC (E), and IL-6 (F) in the lung 
at 24 hours were reduced in IL-1R1– and MyD88-deficient mice as compared with WT mice. Cytokine and chemokine quantification in lung 
homogenates were performed by multiplex ELISA cytokine arrays (detection limit at 1 pg/ml). Data represent mean values ± SD from 2 indepen￾dent experiments (n = 4 mice per group; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).

The induction of cytokines and chemokines involved in neutro￾phil recruitment was evaluated in BALF and lung homogenates of 
C57BL/6 WT and MyD88- and IL-1R1–deficient mice. IL-1β was 
augmented in the lung at 24 hours after BLM administration (Fig￾ure 2D) in C57BL/6 control and IL-1R1–deficient mice but not in 
MyD88-deficient mice, which displayed baseline levels. These data 
suggest that the production of IL-1β is also dependent on MyD88 
pathways other than IL-1R1. Other IL-1–related family receptors, 
in particular ST2 (the IL-33 receptor) and IL-1Rrp2, also signal 
through MyD88 and could play a role in BLM-induced IL-1β
production and inflammation (37, 38). MyD88 was also recently 
implicated in IFN-γR–induced inflammation (39).
The production of the neutrophil chemotactic factor KC (Fig￾ure 2E) and another inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 (Figure 2F), were 
induced in response to BLM in the lung of C57BL/6 mice but were 
dramatically reduced in MyD88–/– and IL-1R1–/– mice. Comparable 
results were obtained in the BALF (data not shown). Therefore, 
BLM-induced IL-1β secretion and IL-1R1 and MyD88 signaling 
are required for the production of KC and IL-6 and for neutrophil 
recruitment into the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar space.
Resident cells mediate BLM-induced acute neutrophil recruitment as well 
as IL-1, IL-6, and KC production into the lung. Since IL-1R1/MyD88 is 
expressed on a broad range of cells, we next addressed the respec￾tive role of bone marrow–derived cells and lung resident cells in 
the BLM response using mixed bone marrow chimeric mice (31). 
C57BL/6 WT bone marrow reconstitution of MyD88–/– mice 
(WT→KO) did not restore neutrophil recruitment to the bron￾choalveolar lavage (BAL) in response to BLM (Figure 3A), while WT 
mice reconstituted with MyD88–/– bone marrow (KO→WT) dis￾played a significant but reduced neutrophil influx in BAL (Figure 
3A). Furthermore, WT bone marrow reconstitution of MyD88–/–
(WT→KO) did not restore neutrophil recruitment into the lung 
parenchyma as assessed by MPO activity in lung homogenate 
after BLM (Figure 3B). By contrast, WT mice reconstituted with 
MyD88–/– bone marrow (KO→WT) had increased MPO activity, 
although it was reduced in comparison with irradiated and recon￾stituted WT mice (WT→WT) (Figure 3B). Therefore, neutrophil 
recruitment in the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar space in 
response to BLM largely depends on MyD88 signaling in radiore￾sistant resident lung cells, but some contribution of hemopoietic 
cells is needed for optimal neutrophil influx.
We next determined the chemokine and cytokine production in 
lung homogenates from chimeric mice. WT bone marrow reconsti￾tution of MyD88-deficient (WT→KO) mice after BLM administra￾tion did not restore IL-1β production in lung tissue (Figure 3C), 
which remained at the level of MyD88–/– mice (KO→KO). In con￾trast, WT mice reconstituted with MyD88–/– bone marrow (KO→
WT) had IL-1β production in lung tissue comparable with that of 
WT controls (WT→WT) (Figure 3C), indicating that the radiore￾sistant resident cells are responsible for most IL-1β production in 
response to BLM administration. Furthermore, WT bone marrow 
reconstitution of MyD88–/– mice (WT→KO) after BLM adminis￾Figure 3
Resident radioresistant cells mediate BLM-induced acute inflammation into lung and bronchoalveolar space. Bone marrow chimeras were 
prepared by lethal irradiation of either WT or MyD88–/– mice, followed by bone marrow cell reconstitution. WT bone marrow reconstitution of 
irradiated MyD88–/– mice (WT→KO) did not restore neutrophil recruitment to the BAL (A) or to the lung parenchyma (B) after BLM administration 
(15 mg/kg i.n.). Irradiated WT mice reconstituted with MyD88–/– bone marrow (KO→WT) displayed reduced neutrophil influx in BAL (A) and lung 
parenchyma (B) compared with WT controls (WT→WT). WT bone marrow reconstitution of irradiated MyD88–/– mice (WT→KO) did not restore 
IL-1β (C), KC (D), or IL-6 (E) productions in lung parenchyma. Neutrophil recruitment into the BAL, MPO activity (measured as optical density 
[OD]), and cytokine and chemokine lung levels were evaluated 24 hours after BLM administration, as described above. Data represent mean 
values ± SD from 2 independent experiments (n = 4 mice per group; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ns, not significant).

tration did not restore KC or IL-6 production in lung tissue (Fig￾ure 3, D and E), which remained at the level of MyD88–/– mice 
(KO→KO). WT mice reconstituted with MyD88–/– bone marrow 
(KO→WT) had increased KC and IL-6 production in lungs, which 
was superior to that of MyD88–/– mice but slightly lower than 
that of WT controls (WT→WT) (Figure 3, D and E). Altogether, 
the results from mixed bone marrow chimera suggest that BLM 
induced neutrophil recruitment in the lung and that IL-1β, KC, 
and IL-6 productions are mediated by IL-1R1/MyD88 signaling 
mainly by a radioresistant, nonhemopoietic cell type that cannot 
be restored by bone marrow cell reconstitution.
Remodeling process induced by BLM injury is IL-1R1 and MyD88 depen￾dent. We extended our analysis of BLM-induced injury and fibrosis 
by evaluating remodeling factors during the repair process. The 
gelatinase activities were assessed by the measurement of MMP-9 
(gelatinase A) and MMP-2 (gelatinase B) by zymography. MMP-9 
(99 kDa) is largely produced by neutrophils, and its activity is 
associated with neutrophil recruitment (40). MMP-9 activity was 
significantly upregulated in BALF at day 1 in C57BL/6 mice but 
not in MyD88–/– mice, and only partially in IL-1R1–/– mice (Figure 
4A). These data suggest that the increase in MMP-9 may also be 
dependent on MyD88 pathways other than IL-1R1. MMP-9 activ￾ity returned to baseline level at day 11 (data not shown), whereas 
MMP-2 (76 kDa) activity was elevated only at day 11 in C57BL/6 
mice but not in MyD88–/– and IL-1R1–/– mice (Figure 4B). Since 
the balance of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) and 
MMPs is an important factor in the fibrotic process, we analyzed 
the production of TIMP-1. TIMP-1 activity was upregulated in 
BALF (data not shown) and lung homogenates of C57BL/6 and 
TLR2/4–/–, but not MyD88–/– or IL-1R1–/–, mice within 24 hours 
(Figure 4, C and D). Therefore, the data suggest that IL-1R1/
MyD88 signaling is required for MMP-9, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 
activation and contributes to fibrosis.
Attenuation of BLM-induced lung fibrosis in IL-1R1– and MyD88-defi￾cient mice. The net result of BLM-induced tissue injury is chronic 
inflammation and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Microscopic 
investigations at 7 days after BLM administration showed acute 
inflammatory reactions in the lungs and signs of fibrosis in 
C57BL/6 mice. The hallmarks of the pathology are severe alveolitis 
with abundant neutrophils in the alveoli, recruitment of mono￾nuclear cells, and destruction and repair with thickening of the 
alveolar septae. On day 11, the lung sections also showed extensive 
fibrotic areas with abundant collagen production (Figure 5B), as 
compared with normal alveolar structure of the saline controls 
(Figure 5A). Cellular infiltrates, alveolar wall destruction, and col￾lagen deposition were significantly reduced in IL-1R1–/– (Figure 
5D) and MyD88–/– mice (Figure 5E), but not in TLR2/4–/– mice 
(Figure 5C). The inflammatory and fibrotic morphological altera￾tions as assessed semiquantitatively were significantly reduced 
in the absence of IL-1R1/MyD88 (data not shown). Moreover, 
biochemically significant collagen deposition in the lung tissue 
of C57BL/6 mice, but not IL1-R1–/– (Figure 5F) or MyD88–/– mice 
(data not shown), was found. TGF-β1, a critical mediator of 
remodeling and fibrotic responses in the lung, was evaluated at 
different time points after BLM administration. Latent TGF-β1 
was detected after activation in BALF from WT mice 7 days after 
BLM administration, but was not detected in BALF from MyD88- 
or IL-1R1–deficient mice (Figure 5G), and persisted until day 14 
in WT mice (53 pg/ml). Active TGF-β1 was undetectable in BALF 
from WT and deficient mice probably due to lower production 
Figure 4
BLM-induced lung tissue remodeling is IL-1R1 and 
MyD88 dependent. pro-MMP-9 (99 kDa) and MMP-2 
(71 kDa) activities in BALF were analyzed by zymog￾raphy 1 and 11 days after administration of BLM (15 
mg/kg i.n.). Pro-MMP-9 was upregulated in the BALF 
of WT mice 24 hours after BLM administration and 
returned to normal levels at day 11, whereas MMP-2 
was upregulated only at day 11 after BLM adminis￾tration (data not shown). (A) Pro-MMP-9 activity was 
not upregulated in the BALF of MyD88–/– mice and 
only partially in IL-1R1–/– mice 24 hours after BLM 
administration. (B) MMP-2 was upregulated by BLM 
in the BALF of WT mice, but less so in MyD88–/– and 
IL-1R1–/– mice on day 11. (C) TIMP-1 as an indica￾tor of a fibrotic process was upregulated in the lungs 
of WT but not MyD88–/– or IL-1R1–/– mice at 24 hours 
after BLM administration (15 mg/kg). (D) TIMP-1 con￾centrations were also increased in TLR2 and TLR4 
double-deficient mice. TIMP-1 levels were assessed 
by ELISA, and data represent mean values ± SD from 
2 independent experiments (n = 4 mice per group; 
*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).

(data not shown). Therefore, IL-1R1/MyD88 signaling is required 
for the development of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and 
collagen deposition in response to BLM.
Exogenous IL-1β causes acute and late lung inflammation, remodel￾ing, and fibrosis. In order to confirm that IL-1β is central in BLM￾induced acute inflammatory response, we first analyzed the effects 
of exogenous recombinant murine IL-1β (rmIL-1β). Mice treated 
with rmIL-1β presented a very transient and modest body weight 
loss in comparison with BLM-treated mice. A single i.n. rmIL-1β
administration resulted in acute neutrophil recruitment into 
BALF at 24 hours in WT mice (Figure 6A), while other cell types 
were essentially not affected (data not shown). As expected, neu￾trophil recruitment in the BALF of IL-1R1– and MyD88-deficient 
mice was impaired after i.n. rmIL-1β, whereas it was dramatically 
increased in TLR2/4-, and TNF-α–deficient mice, suggesting that 
TLR2/4 signaling and TNF-α regulate inflammatory response to 
IL-1β (Figure 6A). Neutrophil influx into lung measured by lung 
MPO activity was impaired in IL-1R1– and MyD88-deficient mice 
after i.n. rmIL-1β but not in TLR2/4- and TNF-α–deficient mice 
(Figure 6B). Administration of rmIL-1β also enhanced the expres￾sion of neutrophil chemotactic factor CXCL1 (KC), IL-6, and TARC 
at 24 hours (Figure 6, C–E) in the lung of C57BL/6, TLR2/4–/–, and 
TNF-α–/– mice but not in IL-1R1–/– or MyD88–/– mice. Therefore, 
exogenous IL-1β induced acute inflammation with neutrophil 
influx, KC, IL-6, and TARC expression dependent on IL-1R1 and 
MyD88 but not on TLR2/4 or TNF-α receptor signaling, which 
resembles the pathology induced by BLM.
To further assess the role of IL-1β in the development of 
lung fibrosis, we analyzed the effect of exogenous rmIL-1β on 
the remodeling process. Indeed, 24 hours after IL-1β instilla￾tion, MMP-9 activity was upregulated in the BALF of C57BL/6, 
TLR2/4–/–, and TNF-α–/– mice but not MyD88–/– or IL-1R1–/– mice 
(Figure 6F). TIMP-1 activity, the hallmark of evolution to pulmo￾nary fibrosis, was dramatically upregulated by rmIL-1β within 24 
hours in lung homogenates of C57BL/6, TLR2/4–/–, and TNF-α–/–
mice but not MyD88–/– or IL-1R1–/– mice (Figure 6G). Similar 
results were obtained in the BALF of these mice (data not shown). 
Therefore, exogenous IL-1β induced MMP-9 and TIMP-1 activa￾tion, which depended on IL-1R1/MyD88 but not TLR2/4 signal￾ing or the presence of TNF-α. TIMP-1 production in WT mice was 
more transient after a single exogenous IL-1β administration than 
after BLM and was reduced at day 7 (data not shown). Moreover, 
we were unable to detect latent TGF-β1 in BALF from WT mice 
after i.n. rIL-1β at day 1, 7, and 14, whereas latent TGF-β1 was 
detected 7 days after BLM administration (Figure 5G) and was still 
present at day 14. A single i.n. rmIL-1β administration resulted 
in significant lymphocyte recruitment into BALF in WT mice at 
7 days as seen with BLM (Figure 7A). Moreover, the pulmonary 
collagen deposition was increased by rmIL-1β, although to a lower 
level than after BLM treatment (Figure 7B). Histological analysis 
of the lung revealed that within 7 days of administration IL-1β
caused tissue injury with marked tissue destruction, disruption 
of alveolar architecture, inflammation, and fibrosis (although less 
pronounced than that obtained after BLM treatment; Figure 7, D 
and E) that was absent in saline controls (Figure 7C) and in the 
lungs of IL-1R1–/– and MyD88–/– mice (data not shown). Further 
collagen accumulation was observed 14 days after rmIL-1β and 
after BLM administration (Figure 7, G and H), in comparison with 
saline treatment (Figure 7F). Therefore, rmIL-1β caused a clear but 
moderate pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting a critical role for endog￾enous IL-1 in BLM-induced inflammation and fibrosis.
Neutralization of IL-1 reduces acute lung inflammation and remodel￾ing induced by BLM. To confirm that IL-1β is a critical mediator 
of BLM-induced lung pathology, IL-1β neutralizing antibodies 
and IL-1Ra were given i.p. at the time of BLM administration. The 
IL-1β neutralizing antibodies reduced neutrophil recruitment in 
the BALF as well as KC and IL-6 production in the lung at day 1 
(data not shown). IL-1Ra dramatically reduced neutrophil influx

into BALF at day 1 (Figure 8A). Interestingly, IL-1Ra was even 
more effective than IL-1β neutralizing antibodies in inhibiting 
neutrophil recruitment in the BALF at day 1 (Figure 8A) and day 
14 (Figure 8B). Total cells were also significantly reduced at days 
1 and 14 by IL-1Ra (data not shown). IL-1β, KC, and IL-6 levels in 
lung were also inhibited by IL-1Ra at day 1 (Figure 8, C–E). Impor￾tantly, TIMP-1 was also dramatically reduced in lung (Figure 8F) 
and BALF (data not shown) after IL-1Ra treatment. Therefore, IL-1 
is a key effector cytokine of the BLM-induced fibrotic lung pathol￾ogy and may represent a critical therapeutic target.
BLM-induced acute inflammation is attenuated in ASC-deficient mice. 
Acute stress and injury induced by BLM may activate the inflam￾masome promoting the processing and secretion of proinflamma￾tory cytokines such as IL-1β. We showed that IL-1β is increased 
and essential in BLM-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that the inflammasome may be critical 
in BLM-induced acute lung injury. In fact, mice deficient for the 
adaptor molecule ASC, shared by NALP1–3, display an important 
reduction of total cell influx (Figure 9A) and neutrophil recruit￾ment (Figure 9B) into the bronchoalveolar space at day 1 after 
BLM administration. Pulmonary MPO activity at day 1 was elevat￾ed only in ASC+/+ mice but was significantly reduced in ASC–/– mice 
(Figure 9C). Interestingly, reduction of neutrophil influx was less 
important in ASC–/– than in IL-1R1–/– mice, suggesting that IL-1α
may also play a role in BLM-induced inflammation. IL-1β produc￾tion into the lung was attenuated in ASC–/– in comparison with 
ASC+/+ control littermates 24 hours after BLM administration 
(Figure 9D). Since both pro-IL-1β and IL-1β can be detected by 
this method, residual amount of cytokine measured in ASC–/– mice 
might correspond to the pro-IL-1β form. IL-6 production into the 
lung 24 hours after BLM treatment was attenuated in ASC–/– in 
comparison with ASC+/+ control littermates (Figure 9E). Compa￾rable reductions of IL-1β and IL-6 were obtained in the BALF (data 
not shown). Therefore, BLM-induced cellular inflammation and 
IL-1β and IL-6 productions are dependent upon the ASC inflam￾masome adaptor molecule, which is required for optimal lung 
inflammation in response to BLM.
Discussion
We show here that the acute lung injury induced by BLM admin￾istration led to the production of IL-1β, inflammation, remod￾eling, and fibrosis and was dependent upon IL-1R1/MyD88 
signaling. Indeed, lung pathology was significantly reduced in 
IL-1R1– and MyD88-deficient mice, pointing to the essential role

mouse, i.e., 0.05 mg/kg) induced acute neutrophil recruitment into BALF (A) and lung (B) in WT, TLR2/4–/–, and TNF-α–/– mice within 24 hours but 
was absent in IL-1R1–/– and MyD88–/– mice. rmIL-1β induced lung KC (C), IL-6 (D), and TARC (E) in WT, TLR2/4–/–, and TNF-α–/– mice but not in

of endogenous IL-1 in pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in 
response to BLM. Confirming that IL-1 acts as a critical media￾tor, we show that exogenous rmIL-1β recapitulates acute inflam￾mation with alveolar tissue destruction and remodeling, resulting 
in progressive interstitial fibrosis. The data suggest that BLM￾mediated lung injury, inflammation, and fibrosis depend upon 
IL-1R1 and MyD88 signaling. Importantly, IL-1R1 blockade by the 
IL-1Ra anakinra attenuates the inflammatory pathology. Finally, 
both lung IL-1β production and acute inflammation upon BLM 
administration are dependent on the presence of the ASC adaptor 
molecule, supporting a critical role of the inflammasome in BLM￾induced lung injury.
BLM causes lung tissue cell stress and damage, which may lead 
to the degradation of the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan 
hyaluronan, elastin, collagens, and other matrix components, 
inducing inflammation. Degradation of extracellular matrix 
upon tissue injury recently attracted substantial interest for the 
molecular mechanisms of inflammation (41). Hyaluronan pro￾duced upon BLM injury induces inflammation that is perpetu￾ated in the absence of the hyaluronan scavenger receptor CD44 
(42). High- and low-molecular fragments seem to have different 
biological effects (41). Since both TLR2 and TLR4 are activated by 
hyaluronan in vitro (10–13, 43), hyaluronan-dependent TLR acti￾vation may play a role in in vivo inflammation and repair. Here we 
examine the requirement of individual TLRs for lung inflamma￾tion and repair upon BLM exposure. Our data using TLR-deficient 
mice show that TLR2, -3, -4, and -9 and notably, combined TLR2/4 
signaling, are dispensable for BLM lung injury. Therefore, we con￾firm that neutrophil recruitment in the airways is dependent upon 
MyD88 signaling but are not able to demonstrate the TLR2/4 
dependence reported previously in response to BLM (14). Indeed, 
Jiang et al. (14) showed a decrease in cellular inflammation in the 
bronchoalveolar space but an enhanced lung injury with increased 
cell accumulation within the interstitium in MyD88- and TLR2/4-
deficient mice in comparison with WT mice. Our different results 
could be explained by differences in the dose and the type of BLM 
used or differences in the genetic background of the genetically 
modified mouse strains used. A similar discussion on the relative 
role of TLR2 and TLR4 versus IL-1R1 in MyD88-dependent mono￾sodium urate crystal–induced inflammation is reported in models 
of gout arthritis (44–46). Therefore the induction of inflamma￾tion in response to BLM in mice is TLR2 and TLR4 independent, 
but this does not exclude a role for TLRs in hyaluronan-mediated 
regulation of inflammation and fibrosis.
An alternative hypothesis to explain inflammation upon tissue 
injury is the induction of protease activation, leading to a multi￾tude of peptides including elastin-derived peptides, which have 
chemoattractive activity, and antibody neutralization of elastin 
fragments has been shown to prevent inflammation (15). Further, 
a tripeptide derived from extracellular matrix degradation has been 
reported to induce CXCR2-dependent lung inflammation (16). In 
addition, CXCR3 signaling appears to be nonredundant in BLM￾induced inflammation and fibrosis (47). Indeed, we show that 
BLM induced the CXC chemokine KC, confirming that lung injury 
release of chemoattractive mediators may enhance inflammation.
Here we demonstrate TLR2- and TLR4-independent, MyD88-
dependent signaling in BLM-induced lung injury, and we investi￾gate the role of IL-1 and IL-18, both important proinflammatory

cytokines, using the MyD88 adaptor for their receptor signaling. 
In fact, we identify IL-1R1 signaling as pivotal for BLM-induced 
injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, as IL-1R1–deficient mice but 
not IL-18R–deficient mice were protected. TGF-β1, a critical medi￾ator of remodeling and fibrotic responses in the lung, was induced 
in BALF after BLM administration in WT mice but was undetect￾able in MyD88- or IL-1R1–deficient mice. We demonstrate that 
IL-1β is produced upon BLM as reported for injured and apop￾totic lung epithelial cells (34). As IL-1β production is decreased in 
MyD88-deficient mice upon BLM administration, the data suggest 
MyD88-dependent signaling for IL-1β production. The IL-1 recep￾tor family, in particular ST2, the IL-33 receptor, and IL-1Rrp2, 
also signal through MyD88 and could play a role in BLM-induced 
IL-1β production and inflammation (37, 48). Moreover, MyD88 
was also recently implicated in IFN-γ receptor–induced inflam￾mation by stabilizing IFN-γ receptor–induced cytokine and che￾mokine mRNA (39). Alternatively, the IL-1R1/MyD88 pathway 
might be required for optimal IL-1β production via autocrine or 
paracrine mechanisms that amplify the response.
Reciprocal MyD88-C57BL/6 bone marrow–chimeric mice sug￾gest that MyD88 signaling in radioresistant resident (probably 
epithelial) cells, rather than in hemopoietic cells, is essential to 
initiate the inflammatory response in terms of neutrophil recruit￾ment, IL-1β, IL-6, and KC production. Nevertheless, hemopoietic 
cells seem to contribute to optimal neutrophil inflammation, 
and this could be related to the production of other neutrophil 
attractants such as eotaxin an MCP-1, which have been impli￾cated in BLM-induced fibrotic changes and could be produced 
by hemopoietic cells in an IL-1R1/MyD88–dependent manner 
(49, 50). IL-1β induced by BLM in epithelial cells triggers a cas￾cade of biochemical events, resulting in the production of several 
mediators and chemokines including KC and IL-6, inflamma￾tion, remodeling, and fibrosis.
To confirm that IL-1 represents a key mediator of the lung 
pathology observed, we administered locally to naive mice either 
IL-1β alone or IL-1β–neutralizing antibodies together with BLM. 
A single i.n. dose of rmIL-1β recapitulated most of the lung injury, 
inflammation, and repair parameters seen after BLM treatment, 
suggesting that IL-1β is indeed a key pathogenic factor. To our 
knowledge, this is the first experimental model demonstrating 
directly that a single IL-1β administration induces lung inflam￾mation and remodeling, progressing to fibrosis. Nevertheless, 
IL-1β induces less inflammation, remodeling, and fibrosis 
than BLM. This may be due to the lower cytotoxicity of IL-1β
in comparison to BLM and to the regulation of IL-1β effects, 
in particular via TNF-α and via TLR2 and TLR4. IL-1 is a criti￾cal inflammatory cytokine and may indeed be responsible for 
lung pathologies (26). Adenoviral gene transfer of human IL-1β
(AdIL-1β) initiated neutrophil inflammation and fibrosis (51). 
Further, IL-1β is expressed in chronically inflamed and fibrotic 
tissues (26, 34, 52–54). IL-1Ra was reported to prevent or revert 
pulmonary fibrosis but to have no effect on acute and chron￾ic inflammation elicited in mice by silica or BLM (55). Finally, 
AdIL-1β together with TNF-α induces TGF-β and Smad3, which 
are critical in fibrogenesis. In fact, absence of Smad3 abrogates 
fibrosis induced by AdIL-1β (56).

Blockade of IL-1R1 reduces acute lung inflammation. One administration of IL-1Ra (10 mg/kg i.p.) at the time of BLM challenge (15 mg/kg i.n., 
day 0), dramatically prevented neutrophil recruitment in BALF (A) as well as IL-1β (C), KC (D), and IL-6 (E) production and TIMP-1 expression 
(F) in the lung measured at day 1. Several administrations of IL-1Ra (1 mg/kg i.p.) on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11 after BLM challenge (15 mg/kg 
i.n., day 0) induced a prolonged reduction of neutrophil recruitment in BALF, documented on day 14 (B). Data represent mean values ± SD from 
2 independent experiments (n = 4 mice per group; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).

In the BLM model, overt inflammation with tissue damage pre￾cedes the repair process, leading to fibrosis, and the pathological 
process is under the control of several factors. TNF-α and IL-18 
were reported to play a role in BLM lung inflammation and fibrosis 
(57–60), which we could not confirm using TNF-α– and IL-18R–
deficient mice. In particular, TNF-α was believed to be the essen￾tial inflammatory cytokine in pulmonary fibrosis and anti–TNF-α, 
but not anti–IL-1, neutralizing therapies were used in clinical trials 
in the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Nevertheless, TNF-α seems particularly important in resolving the 
experimental BLM-mediated inflammation and fibrosis (61). The 
present results demonstrate that endogenous IL-1 is crucial and 
nonredundant in BLM induced pathology, rather than TNF-α as 
proposed before (57, 58, 62). In fact, exogenous IL-1β recapitulates 
acute inflammation and remodeling induced by BLM with alveo￾lar tissue destruction, resulting in progressive interstitial fibrosis. 
Furthermore, several recent reports suggest that phenotypes asso￾ciated with MyD88 deficiency are not necessarily due to defective 
TLR signaling but rather to IL-1R1/MyD88 signaling (46, 63–65).
Finally, IL-1R1 blockade with IL-1Ra (anakinra) dramatically 
attenuated lung inflammation induced by BLM. Previous stud￾ies using IL-1Ra treatment in mice reported either an inhibitory 
effect of IL-1Ra on fibrosis but not on acute or chronic inflamma￾tion induced by BLM (55) or no effect of IL-1Ra on BLM-induced 
fibrosis (66). To our knowledge, no further studies have attempt￾ed to resolve this conflict. Nevertheless, there is still no available 
treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, from which patients 
die 3 or 4 years after the onset of the fibrotic phase. We and others 
showed that IL-1β is not only a proinflammatory cytokine but is 
also profibrotic (25, 51). IL-1β is associated with autoinflamma￾tory and autoimmune diseases in humans and plays a central role 
during the tissue destructive phase of these diseases. Moreover, 
IL-1 neutralization is very efficient in treating several destruc￾tive diseases such as systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
hereditary periodic fever syndromes, and gout arthritis (67–74). 
This illustrates the pleiotropic role of IL-1β and the potential 
of IL-1 neutralization in the resolution of severe diseases. Our 
results documenting the prominent role of IL-1 in BLM-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis in an experimental murine model represent￾ing several aspects of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are in sup￾port of reconsidering IL-1 neutralization in treatment of severe 
human lung fibrosis.
A crucial part of the innate immune response is the assembly 
of the inflammasome, a cytosolic complex of proteins that acti￾vates caspase-1 to process the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β
and IL-18. The adaptor protein ASC is essential for inflammasome 
function, binding directly to caspase-1 (75, 76). The inflamma￾some may be involved as a crucial innate sensor of danger signals 
generated by lung injury, and the new family of pathogen-recog￾nition receptors, the NACHT-LRRs, including NALPs, may have 
a complementary role to that of TLRs (19). We show here that 
IL-1β production and lung inflammation in response to BLM 
are dependent upon the adaptor protein ASC, demonstrating for 
what we believe to be the first time a pivotal role of the inflam￾masome in BLM-induced lung injury. Therefore, our data suggest 
that activation of the inflammasome rather than TLRs is critical 
to produce mature IL-1β in response to danger signals induced 
by acute lung injury. We demonstrate that IL-1β maturation by 
the inflammasome and IL-1R1/MyD88 signaling are crucial steps 
of innate immune and pathologic responses in lung injury. The

endogenous danger signals leading to inflammasome activation 
upon BLM are not known. Our findings open important fields 
and questions upon the nature of receptors involved in sensing 
endogenous dangers signals and in assembly of the inflammasome 
upon lung injury.
In an attempt to summarize our data, we propose the model pre￾sented in Figure 10. BLM-induced cell injury results in release and 
sensing of danger/stress signals by the inflammasome in hemo￾poietic and/or tissue-resident lung cells. Activation of the inflam￾masome leads to the processing and maturation of pro-IL-1β into 
biologically active IL-1β, essential for the BLM-induced inflam￾mation, whereas processing of pro-IL-18 into IL-18 is dispensable. 
IL-1β then activates the IL-1R1/MyD88 complex in tissue-resident 
cells, probably pulmonary epithelial cells, leading to inflammation 
with neutrophil and lymphocyte recruitment and to fibroblast 
activation. Lung fibroblast activation results in metalloproteinase/
TIMP-1 imbalance in favor of TIMP-1 and fibroblast proliferation, 
yielding to collagen deposition and pulmonary fibrosis.
In conclusion, we implicate the inflammasome rather than TLRs 
in the sensing of the danger/stress signal, leading to the produc￾tion of IL-1β, and demonstrate that IL-1 is a critical inflammatory 
mediator of acute inflammation, remodeling, and fibrosis upon 
BLM lung injury. Therefore, the data point to a pivotal role of IL-1 
in the innate immune response and underline the importance of 
IL-1 and IL-1R signaling as potential therapeutic targets in inflam￾matory and fibrotic lung disease. These findings provide insight 
into the molecular processes underlying the inflammatory condi￾tions of BLM-induced lung fibrosis and further support a pivotal 
role of the inflammasome in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 
pulmonary chronic diseases.

pathways, cellular sources and the specific

BLM induces pulmonary cell injury. (ii) Dan￾ger/stress signals generated by dying cells 
are sensed by the inflammasome rather than 
TLRs in antigen-presenting cells (alveolar 
macrophages, dendritic cells, and/or epithelial 
cells). (iii) Danger signals induce membrane 
signals, leading probably to the activation of 
a NALP protein and to the recruitment and 
activation of the adaptor ASC and caspase-1, 
known to interact via PYR-PYR and CARD￾CARD homotypic interactions. (iv) Inflamma￾some activation results in the processing and 
maturation of pro-IL-1β into its biologically 
active form IL-1, and to IL-1β secretion. The 
production of pro-IL-1β seems independent 
of TLRs and could be attributed to sensing 
by other NACHT-LRRs. (v) IL-1β then acti￾vates the IL-1R1 complex in tissue-resident 
cells (probably pulmonary epithelial cells), 
leading to the recruitment of MyD88 via TIR￾TIR homotypic interactions. Triggering of the 
IL-1R1/MyD88 pathway results in the activa￾tion of transcription factors such as NF-κB, 
which will turn on the transcription of neutro￾phil-attracting chemokines such as KC, lym￾phocyte-attracting chemokines such as TARC, 
and the transcription of inflammatory cytokines 
such as IL-6, resulting in lung inflammation 
(vi). IL-1R1/MyD88-dependent IL-1β produc￾tion by tissue-resident cells may contribute 
to an autocrine/paracrine amplification loop. 
IL-1R1 blockade with IL-1Ra (anakinra) atten￾uates lung inflammation induced by BLM. 
IL-1β will also activate the IL-1R1/MyD88 
pathway in fibroblasts, leading to metallopro￾teinase/TIMP-1 imbalance in favor of TIMP-1 
and to fibroblast proliferation, resulting in col￾lagen deposition and pulmonary fibrosis (vii).

on the WT C57BL/6 genetic background and 7 times for IL-1R1–/– and 
TLR3–/– mice. Littermate controls were used for ASC–/– backcrossed only 3 
times on the WT C57BL/6 genetic background. All mice, including control 
C57BL/6 (MyD88+/+), were bred in our animal facility at the Transgenose 
Institute (CNRS, Orleans, France). For experiments, adult (6–10 weeks old) 
animals were kept in sterile, isolated ventilated cages. All animal experi￾ments complied with the French Government’s ethical and animal experi￾ment regulations and were approved by the Comité Régional d’Ethique 
pour l’Expérimentation Animale (Tours, France). All animals had access to 
water and food ad libitum before and after exposure.
Administration of BLM, IL-1β, IL-1 neutralizing antibody, or IL-1Ra. BLM sul￾fate (300 μg or 15 mg/kg) from Bellon Laboratories in saline, mr IL-1β
(0.25 μg or 1 μg) from R&D Systems in saline, or saline alone were given 
through the airways by nasal instillation in a volume of 40 μl under light 
ketamine-xylasine anesthesia. The IL-1β neutralizing antibody (provided 
by H. Gram Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) and the IL-1Ra (Amgen) 
were injected at 100 μg i.p. at the time of BLM administration.
BALF. After incision of the trachea, a plastic cannula was inserted and 
airspaces were washed using 0.3 ml of PBS solution heated to 37°C. The rib 
cage was then gently massaged to enable maximum cell collection. The fluid 
was collected by careful aspiration. This procedure was performed 10 times, 
and the recovery of the total lavage exceeded 95%. The samples collected 
were dispatched in 2 fractions: the first (1 ml corresponding to the 2 first 
lavages) was used for mediator measurement, and the second for the cell 
determination (4 ml). The first fraction was centrifuged (600 g for 10 min￾utes), and supernatant was fractionated and kept at –80°C until mediator 
determination. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 0.4 ml PBS, pooled 
with the second fraction, and maintained at 4°C until cell determination.
Lung homogenization. After BAL was performed, the whole lung was 
removed and placed inside a microtube (Lysing matrix D; Q Bio Gene) with 
1 ml PBS, total lung tissue extract was prepared using a Fastprep system 
(FP120, Q Bio Gene), the extract was then centrifuged and the supernatant 
stored at –80°C before mediator measurement, MPO, or collagen assay 
with Sircol Collagen Assay (France Biochem Division).
MPO activity in lung. Lung tissue MPO activity was evaluated as described 
(85). In brief, the right heart ventricle was perfused with saline to flush 
the vascular content, and lungs were frozen at –20°C until use. Lung was 
homogenized by polytron and centrifuged, and the supernatant was dis￾carded. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml PBS containing 0.5% hexa￾decyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) and 5 mM EDTA. Following 
centrifugation, 50 μl of supernatants were placed in test tubes with 200 
μl PBS-HTAB-EDTA, 2 ml Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS), 100 μl 
o-dianisidine dihydrochloride (1.25 mg/ml), and 100 μl H2O2 0.05%. After 
15 minutes of incubation at 37°C in an agitator, the reaction was stopped 
with 100 μl NaN3 1%. The MPO activity was determined as absorbance at 
460 nm against medium.
Cell count and determination. Total cell count was determined in BALF 
using a particle counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter). Differential cell 
counts were performed on cytospin preparations (Cytospin 3; Thermo 
Shandon) after staining for 4 minutes in May-Grünwald stain (MG-1L; 
Sigma-Aldrich) and 8 minutes in 95% Giemsa stain (GS-500; Sigma￾Aldrich). Differential cell counts were made on 100 cells using standard 
morphological criteria.
Mediator measurements. IL-1β, KC, IL-6, TARC, and TIMP-1 levels in BALF 
or lung homogenate were determined using ELISA assay kits (Mouse Duo￾Set for IL-1β, KC, IL-6, TARC, and TIMP-1; R&D Systems), except for the 
experiments described in Figures 2 and 3, according to manufacturer’s 
instructions. For experiments described in Figures 2 and 3, IL-1β, KC, and 
IL-6 were measured by multiplex ELISA cytokine arrays with a limit detec￾tion of 1 pg/ml (Upstate Ltd.). TGF-β1 levels in BALF were determined 
using an ELISA kit (Quantikine, mouse, rat, porcine, canine TGF-β1 
Immunoassay; R&D Systems).
Bone marrow transplantation to obtain mixed chimera. Recipient mice under￾went a lethal total-body irradiation as reported before (86, 87). Fresh, 
unseparated bone marrow cells (2 × 106 per mouse) were injected into the 
lateral tail vein of the irradiated recipient mice 24 hours after lethal irradia￾tion. Blood was collected in EDTA-containing tubes at regular intervals, 
and the hematological parameters were determined with a Technikon H1E 
analyzer. The reconstituted mice were used 3 months after bone marrow 
transplantation. Further, in some experiments we used GFP-expressing 
donor cells (88), in order to control the extent of reconstitution, as previ￾ously described (31). The current protocol yielded more than 95% of blood 
circulating leukocytes of donor origin as assessed by green fluorescence of 
the peripheral blood using flow cytometry.
Zymographic analysis of MMPs. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were determined 
by gelatin zymography. Briefly, nonreduced supernatant samples of BALF 
(15 μl) and standards (161-0305; Bio-Rad) were loaded onto 7% polyacryl￾amide gels (wt/vol) incorporating 0.1% (wt/vol) gelatin substrate. Proteins 
were subjected to electrophoresis at 20–30 mA for 3 hours. The gel was 
then washed twice in 2.5% Triton (vol/vol), rinsed 3 times quickly with 
distilled water, and placed in distilled water 3 times for 20 minutes. Each 
wash was performed using gentle stirring. Gels were incubated overnight 
at 37°C in 50 mM Tris buffer (containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 2 μM ZnCl2). 
Finally, gels were stained in Coomassie Blue and then destained progres￾sively until bands of lysis (enzyme activity) in the gels appeared as regions 
of negative staining. The areas of lysis were analyzed using a densitometric 
analyzer (Bio-profil; Vilbert Lourmat), images were taken, and band densi￾ties were measured.
Lung collagen measurements. Aliquots of lung homogenate (50 μl) were 
then assayed for lung collagen levels and compared with a standard curve 
prepared from bovine skin using the Sircol collagen dye binding assay 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Biocolor Ltd.).
Histology. After BAL and lung perfusion, the large lobe was fixed in 
4% buffered formaldehyde for standard microscopic analysis. Sections 
(3 μm) were stained with H&E or Chromotrope Aniline Blue as described 
previously (89). The severity of the morphological changes (infiltration by 
neutrophils and mononuclear cells and destruction and thickening of the 
alveolar septae and fibrosis) were assessed semiquantitatively using a score 
of 0–5 by 2 independent observers.
Statistics. Statistical evaluation of differences between the experimental 
groups was determined by Mann-Whitney U test using Prism software. 
P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
