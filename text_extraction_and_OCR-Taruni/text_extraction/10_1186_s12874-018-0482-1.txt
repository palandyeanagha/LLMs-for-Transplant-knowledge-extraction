Abstract
Background: Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the relationships between
patients’ covariates (e.g. clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of various treatment options. Standard
survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical
knowledge to model treatment interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural
networks and survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have yet to be shown as
effective treatment recommender systems.
Methods: We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network and state-of-the-art survival
method for modeling interactions between a patient’s covariates and treatment effectiveness in order to provide
personalized treatment recommendations.
Results: We perform a number of experiments training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We
demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that
DeepSurv successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a patient’s covariates and their risk of
failure. We then show how DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient’s features and effectiveness of
different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations.
Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to demonstrate how it’s personalized treatment recommendations
would increase the survival time of a set of patients.
Conclusions: The predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable medical researchers to use deep
neural networks as a tool in their exploration, understanding, and prediction of the effects of a patient’s characteristics
on their risk of failure.

survival model is the Cox proportional hazards model
(CPH) [5]. The CPH is a semiparametric model that cal￾culates the effects of observed covariates on the risk of an
event occurring (e.g. ‘death’). The model assumes that a
patient’s log-risk of failure is a linear combination of the
patient’s covariates. This assumption is referred to as the
linear proportional hazards condition. However, in many
applications, such as providing personalized treatment
recommendations, it may be too simplistic to assume that
the log-risk function is linear. As such, a richer family of
survival models is needed to better fit survival data with
nonlinear log-risk functions.

To model nonlinear survival data, researchers have
applied three main types of neural networks to the prob￾lem of survival analysis. These include variants of: (i)
classification methods (see details in [6, 7]), (ii) time￾encoded methods (see details in [8, 9]), (iii) and risk￾predicting methods (see details in [10]). This third type
is a feed-forward neural network (NN) that estimates an
individual’s risk of failure. In fact, Faraggi-Simon’s network
is seen as a nonlinear extension of the Cox proportional
hazards model.
Risk neural networks learn highly complex and nonlin￾ear relationships between prognostic features and an indi￾vidual’s risk of failure. In application, for example, when
the success of a treatment option is affected by an individ￾ual’s features, the NN learns the relationship without prior
feature selection or domain expertise. The network is then
able to provide a personalized recommendation based on
the computed risk of a treatment.
However, previous studies have demonstrated mixed
results on NNs ability to predict risk. For instance,
researchers have attempted to apply the Faraggi-Simon
network with various extensions, but they have failed to
demonstrate improvements beyond the linear Cox model,
see [11–13]. One possible explanation is that the practice
of NNs was not as developed as it is today. To the best
of our knowledge, NNs have not outperformed standard
methods for survival analysis (e.g. CPH). Our manuscript
shows that this is no longer the case; with modern tech￾niques, risk NNs have state-of-the-art performance and
can be used for a variety of medical applications.
The goals of this paper are: (i) to show that the appli￾cation of deep learning to survival analysis performs as
well as or better than other survival methods in predicting
risk; and (ii) to demonstrate that the deep neural network
can be used as a personalized treatment recommender
system and a useful framework for further medical
research.
We propose a modern Cox proportional hazards deep
neural network, henceforth referred to as DeepSurv, as
the basis for a treatment recommender system. We make
the following contributions. First, we show that Deep￾Surv performs as well as or better than other survival
analysis methods on survival data with both linear and
nonlinear effects from covariates. Second, we include
an additional categorical variable representing a patient’s
treatment group to illustrate how the network can learn
complex relationships between an individual’s covariates
and the effect of a treatment. Our experiments validate
that the network successfully models the treatment’s risk
within a population. Third, we use DeepSurv to pro￾vide treatment recommendations tailored to a patient’s
observed features. We confirm our results on real clin￾ical studies, which further demonstrates the power of
DeepSurv. Finally, we show that the recommender system
supports medical practitioners in providing personal￾ized treatment recommendations that potentially could
increase the median survival time for a set of patients.
The organization of the manuscript is as follows: in
“Background” section, we provide a brief background on
survival analysis. In “Methods” section, we present our
contributions, including an explanation of our imple￾mentation of DeepSurv and our proposed recommender
system. In “Results” section, we describe the experimen￾tal design and results. “Conclusion” and “Discussion”
sections conclude the manuscript.
In this section, we define survival data and the
approaches for modeling a population’s survival and fail￾ure rate. Additionally, we discuss linear and nonlinear
survival models and their limitations.
Survival data
Survival data is comprised of three elements: a patient’s
baseline data x, a failure event time T, and an event indica￾tor E. If an event (e.g. death) is observed, the time interval
T corresponds to the time elapsed between the time in
which the baseline data was collected and the time of
the event occurring, and the event indicator is E = 1.
If an event is not observed, the time interval T corre￾sponds to the time elapsed between the collection of the
baseline data and the last contact with the patient (e.g.
end of study), and the event indicator is E = 0. In this
case, the patient is said to be right-censored. If one opts to
use standard regression methods, the right-censored data
is considered to be a type of missing data. This is typi￾cally discarded which can introduce a bias in the model.
Therefore, modeling right-censored data requires special
consideration or the use of a survival model.
Survival and hazard functions are the two fundamen￾tal functions in survival analysis. The survival function is
denoted by S(t) = Pr(T > t), which signifies the proba￾bility that an individual has ‘survived’ beyond time t. The
hazard function λ(t) is defined as:
λ(t) = lim
δ→0
Pr(t ≤ T < t + δ | T ≥ t)
δ . (1)
The hazard function is the probability an individual will
not survive an extra infinitesimal amount of time δ, given
they have already survived up to time t. Thus, a greater
hazard signifies a greater risk of death.
Linear survival models
The Cox proportional hazards model is a common
method for modeling an individual’s survival given their
baseline data x. In accordance with the standard R sur￾vival package coxph, we use notation from [14] to describe
the Cox model. The model assumes that the hazard func￾tion is composed of two non-negative functions: a baseline

Katzman et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology (2018) 18:24 Page 3 of 12
hazard function, λ0(t), and a risk score, r(x) = eh(x)
,
defined as the effect of an individual’s observed covariates
on the baseline hazard [14]. We denote h(x) as the log-risk
function. The hazard function is assumed to have the form
λ(t|x) = λ0(t) · eh(x)
. (2)
The CPH is a proportional hazards model that estimates
the log-risk function, h(x), by a linear function hˆβ(x) =
βTx [or equivalently rˆβ(x) = eβT x]. To perform Cox
regression, one tunes the weights β to optimize the Cox
partial likelihood. The partial likelihood is the product of
the probability at each event time Ti that the event has
occurred to individual i, given the set of individuals still at
risk at time Ti. The Cox partial likelihood is parameterized
by β and defined as
Lc(β) = 
i:Ei=1
rˆβ(xi)

j∈(Ti)
rˆβ(xj) = 
i:Ei=1
exp(hˆβ(xi))

j∈(Ti)
exp(hˆβ(xj))
,
(3)
where the values Ti, Ei, and xi are the respective event
time, event indicator, and baseline data for the i
th observa￾tion. The product is defined over the set of patients with
an observable event Ei = 1. The risk set (t) = {i : Ti ≥ t}
is the set of patients still at risk of failure at time t.
In many applications, for example modeling nonlinear
gene interactions, we cannot assume the data satisfies the
linear proportional hazards condition. In this case, the
CPH model would require computing high-level interac￾tion terms. This becomes prohibitively expensive as the
number of features and interactions increases. Therefore,
a more complex nonlinear model is needed.
Nonlinear survival models
The Faraggi-Simon method is a feed-forward neural net￾work that provides the basis for a nonlinear proportional
hazards model. [10] experimented with a single hidden
layer network with two or three nodes. Their model
requires no prior assumption of the log-risk function h(x)
other than continuity. Instead, the NN computes nonlin￾ear features from the training data and calculates their
linear combination to estimate the log-risk function. Sim￾ilar to Cox regression, the network optimizes a modified
Cox partial likelihood. They replace the linear combina￾tion of features hˆβ(x) in Eq. 3 with the output of the
network hˆ θ (x).
As previous research suggests, the Faraggi-Simon net￾work has not been shown to outperform the linear CPH
[10, 12, 13]. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we
were the first to attempt applying modern deep learning
techniques to the Cox proportional hazards loss function.
Another popular machine learning approach to model￾ing patients’ hazard function is the random survival forest
(RSF) [15, 16]. The random survival forest is a tree method
that produces an ensemble estimate for the cumulative
hazard function.
A more recent deep learning approach models the event
time according to a Weibull distribution with parameters
given by latent variables generated by a deep exponential
family [17].
Methods
In this section, we describe our methodology for pro￾viding personalized treatment recommendations using
DeepSurv. First, we describe the architecture and train￾ing details of DeepSurv, an open source Python module
that applies recent deep learning techniques to a nonlin￾ear Cox proportional hazards network. Second, we define
DeepSurv as a prognostic model and show how to use the
network’s predicted log-risk function to provide personal￾ized treatment recommendations.
DeepSurv
DeepSurv is a deep feed-forward neural network which
predicts the effects of a patient’s covariates on their haz￾ard rate parameterized by the weights of the network θ.
Figure 1 illustrates the basic components of DeepSurv.
The input to the network is a patient’s baseline data x. The
hidden layers of the network consist of a fully-connected
layer of nodes, followed by a dropout layer [18]. The out￾put of the network hˆ θ (x) is a single node with a linear
activation which estimates the log-risk function in the
Cox model (Eq. 2). We train the network by setting the
objective function to be the average negative log partial
likelihood of Eq. 3 with regularization:
l(θ ):=− 1
NE=1

i:Ei=1
⎛
⎝hˆ θ (xi) − log 
j∈(Ti)
ehˆ θ (xj)
⎞
⎠+λ·||θ||2
2,
(4)
where NE=1 is the number of patients with an observable
event and λ is the 2 regularization parameter. We then
use gradient descent optimization to find the weights of
the network which minimize Eq. 4.
We use modern deep learning techniques to optimize
the training of the network. These include: standardizing
the input, Scaled Exponential Linear Units (SELU) [19]
as the activation function, Adaptive Moment Estimation
(Adam) [20] for the gradient descent algorithm, Nesterov
momentum [21], and learning rate scheduling [22]. To
tune the network’s hyper-parameters, we perform a Ran￾dom hyper-parameter optimization search [23]. For more
technical details, see Appendix A.

Fig. 1 Diagram of DeepSurv. DeepSurv is a configurable feed-forward
deep neural network. The input to the network is the baseline data x.
The network propagates the inputs through a number of hidden
layers with weights θ. The hidden layers consist of fully-connected
nonlinear activation functions followed by dropout. The final layer is a
single node which performs a linear combination of the hidden
features. The output of the network is taken as the predicted log-risk
function hˆ θ (x). The hyper-parameters of the network (e.g. number of
hidden layers, number of nodes in each layer, dropout probability,
etc.) were determined from a random hyper-parameter search and
are detailed in Table 3
Treatment recommender system
In a clinical study, patients are subject to different levels of
risk based on their relevant prognostic features and which
treatment they undergo. We generalize this assumption as
follows. Let all patients in a given study be assigned to one
of n treatment groups τ ∈ {0, 1, ... , n − 1}. We assume
each treatment i to have an independent risk function
ehi(x)
. Collectively, the hazard function becomes:
λ(t; x|τ = i) = λ0(t) · ehi(x)
. (5)
For any patient, the network should be able to accu￾rately predict the log-risk hi(x) of being prescribed a given
treatment i. Then, based on the assumption that each indi￾vidual has the same baseline hazard function λ0(t), we
can take the log of the hazards ratio to calculate the per￾sonal risk-ratio of prescribing one treatment option over
another. We define this difference of log hazards as the
recommender function or recij(x):
recij(x) = log	λ(t; x|τ = i)
λ(t; x|τ = j)


= log
λ0(t) · ehi(x)
λ0(t) · ehj(x)

= hi(x) − hj(x).
(6)
The recommender function can be used to provide per￾sonalized treatment recommendations. We first pass a
patient through the network once in treatment group
i and again in treatment group j and take the differ￾ence. When a patient receives a positive recommenda￾tion recij(x), treatment i leads to a higher risk of death
than treatment j. Hence, the patient should be prescribed
treatment j. Conversely, a negative recommendation indi￾cates that treatment i is more effective and leads to a
lower risk of death than treatment j, and we recommend
treatment i.
DeepSurv’s architecture holds an advantage over the
CPH because it calculates the recommender function
without an a priori specification of treatment interac￾tion terms. In contrast, the CPH model computes a
constant recommender function unless treatment inter￾action terms are added to the model, see Appendix B
for more details. Discovering relevant interaction terms
is expensive because it requires extensive experimenta￾tion or prior biological knowledge of treatment outcomes.
Therefore, DeepSurv is more cost-effective compared
to CPH.
Results
We perform four sets of experiments: (i) simulated sur￾vival data, (ii) real survival data, (iii) simulated treatment
data, and (iv) real treatment data. First, we use simu￾lated data to show how DeepSurv successfully learns the
true log-risk function of a population. Second, we vali￾date the network’s predictive ability by training DeepSurv
on real survival data. Third, we simulate treatment data
to verify that the network models multiple risk func￾tions in a population based on the specific treatment a
patient undergoes. Fourth, we demonstrate how Deep￾Surv provides treatment recommendations and show that
DeepSurv’s recommendations improve a population’s sur￾vival rate. For more technical details on the experiments,
see Appendix A.
In addition to training DeepSurv on each dataset, we
run a linear CPH regression for a baseline comparison.
We also fit a RSF to compare DeepSurv against a state￾of-the-art nonlinear survival model. Even though we can
compare the RSF’s predictive accuracy to DeepSurv’s, we
do not measure the RSF’s performance on modeling a sim￾ulated dataset’s true log-risk function h(x). This is due to
the fact that the the RSF calculates the cumulative haz￾ard function (t) =  t
0 λ(τ )dτ rather than the hazard
function λ(t).

Evaluation
Survival data
To evaluate the models’ predictive accuracy on the sur￾vival data, we measure the concordance-index (C-index)
c as outlined by [24]. The C-index is the most common
metric used in survival analysis and reflects a measure of
how well a model predicts the ordering of patients’ death
times. For context, a c = 0.5 is the average C-index of a
random model, whereas c = 1 is a perfect ranking of death
times. We perform bootstrapping [25] and sample the test
set with replacement to obtain confidence intervals.
Treatment recommendations
We determine the recommended treatment for each
patient in the test set using DeepSurv and the RSF.
We do not calculate the recommended treatment for
CPH; without preselected treatment-interaction terms,
the CPH model will compute a constant recommender
function and recommend the same treatment option for
all patients. This would effectively be comparing the sur￾vival rates between the control and experimental groups.
DeepSurv and the RSF are capable of predicting an indi￾vidual’s hazard per treatment because each computes
relevant interaction terms. For DeepSurv, we choose the
recommended treatment by calculating the recommender
function (Eq. 11). Because the RSF predicts a cumulative
hazard for each patient, we choose the treatment with the
minimum cumulative hazard.
Once we determine the recommended treatment, we
identify two subsets of patients: those whose treatment
group aligns with the model’s recommended treatment
(Recommendation) and those who do not undergo the
recommended treatment (Anti-Recommendation). We
calculate the median survival time of each subset to deter￾mine if a model’s treatment recommendations increase
the survival rate of the patients. We then perform a log￾rank test to validate whether the difference between the
two subsets is significant.
Simulated survival data
In this section, we perform two experiments with simu￾lated survival data: one with a linear log-risk function and
one with a nonlinear (Gaussian) log-risk function. The
advantage of using simulated datasets is that we can ascer￾tain whether DeepSurv can successfully model the true
log-risk function instead of overfitting random noise.
For each experiment, we generate a training, valida￾tion, and testing set of N = 4000, 1000, 1000 obser￾vations respectively. Each observation x represents a
patient vector with d = 10 covariates. The ten vari￾ables are each drawn from a uniform distribution on
[ −1, 1). We then generate a patient’s death time T as
a function of their covariates by using the exponential
Cox model [26]:
T ∼ Exp(λ(t; x)) = Exp 
λ0 · eh(x)

. (7)
In both experiments, the log-risk function h(x) only
depends on two of the ten covariates. This allows us to
verify that DeepSurv discerns the relevant covariates from
the noise. Next, we choose a censoring time to represent
the ‘end of study’ such that 50 percent of the patients have
an observed event, E = 1, in the dataset. Further details of
the simulated data generation are found in Appendix C.
Linear experiment
We first simulate patients to have a linear log-risk func￾tion for x ∈ Rd so that the linear proportional hazards
assumption holds true:
h(x) = x0 + 2x1. (8)
Because the linear proportional hazards assumption holds
true, we expect the linear CPH to accurately model the
log-risk function in Eq. 8.
Our results (see Table 1) demonstrate that DeepSurv
performs as well as the standard linear Cox regression and
better than RSF in predictive ability.
Figure 2 demonstrates how DeepSurv more accurately
models the log-risk function compared to the linear CPH.
Figure 2a plots the true log-risk function h(x) for all
patients in the test set. As shown in Fig. 2b, the CPH’s esti￾mated log-risk function hˆβ(x) does not perfectly model
the true log-risk for a patient. In contrast, as shown
in Fig. 2c, DeepSurv better estimates the true log-risk
function.
To quantify these differences, Fig. 2d and e show that the
CPH’s estimated log-risk has a significantly larger absolute
error than that of DeepSurv, specifically for patients with
a high positive log-risk. We calculate the mean-squared￾error (MSE) between a model’s predicted log-risk and the
true log-risk values. The MSEs of CPH and DeepSurv
are 20.528 057 878 872 541 and 0.192 683 15, respectively.
Even though DeepSurv and CPH have similar predic￾tive abilities, this demonstrates that DeepSurv is superior
than the CPH at modeling the true risk function of the
population.
Nonlinear experiment
We set the log-risk function to be a Gaussian with λmax =
5.0 and a scale factor of r = 0.5:
h(x) = log(λmax) exp
−x2
0 + x2
1
2r2

. (9)
The surface of the log-risk function is depicted in Fig. 3a.
Because this log-risk function is nonlinear, we do not
expect the CPH to predict the log-risk function properly
without adding quadratic terms of the covariates to the
model. We expect DeepSurv to reconstruct the Gaussian
log-risk function and successfully predict a patient’s risk.

The bold faced numbers signify the best performing algorithm
Lastly, we expect the RSF and DeepSurv to accurately rank
the order of patient’s deaths.
The CI results in Table 1 shows that DeepSurv outper￾forms the linear CPH and predicts as well as the RSF.
In addition, DeepSurv correctly learns nonlinear relation￾ships between a patient’s covariates and their log-risk.
As shown in Fig. 3, DeepSurv is more successful than
the linear CPH in modeling the true log-risk function.
Figure 3b demonstrates that the linear CPH regression
fails to determine the first two covariates as significant.
The CPH has a C-index of 0.486728, which is equivalent to
the performance of randomly ranking death times. Mean￾while, Fig. 3c demonstrates that DeepSurv reconstructs
the Gaussian relationship between the first two covariates
and a patient’s log-risk.
Real survival data experiments
We compare the performance of the CPH and DeepSurv
on three datasets from real studies: the Worcester
Heart Attack Study (WHAS), the Study to Understand
Prognoses Preferences Outcomes and Risks of Treat￾ment (SUPPORT), and The Molecular Taxonomy of
Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC).
Because previous research shows that neural net￾works do not outperform the CPH, our goal is to
demonstrate that DeepSurv does indeed have state-of￾the-art predictive ability in practice on real survival
datasets.
Worcester Heart Attack Study (WHAS)
The Worcester Heart Attack Study (WHAS) investigates
the effects of a patient’s factors on acute myocardial
infraction (MI) survival [27]. The dataset consists of 1638
observations and 5 features: age, sex, body-mass-index
(BMI), left heart failure complications (CHF), and order
of MI (MIORD). We reserve 20 percent of the dataset as
a testing set. A total of 42.12 percent of patients died dur￾ing the survey with a median death time of 516.0 days.

As shown in Table 1, DeepSurv outperforms the CPH;
however, the RSF outperforms DeepSurv.

The Study to Understand Prognoses Preferences Out￾comes and Risks of Treatment (SUPPORT) is a larger
study that researches the survival time of seriously ill
hospitalized adults [28]. The dataset consists of 9,105
patients and 14 features for which almost all patients have
observed entries (age, sex, race, number of comorbidi￾ties, presence of diabetes, presence of dementia, presence
of cancer, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respi￾ration rate, temperature, white blood cell count, serum’s
sodium, and serum’s creatinine). We drop patients with
any missing features and reserve 20 percent of the dataset
as a testing set. A total of 68.10 percent of patients died
during the survey with a median death time of 58 days.
As shown in Table 1, DeepSurv performs as well as the
RSF and better than the CPH with a larger study. This val￾idates DeepSurv’s ability to predict the ranking of patient’s
risks on real survival data.
Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International
Consortium (METABRIC)
The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International
Consortium (METABRIC) uses gene and protein expres￾sion profiles to determine new breast cancer subgroups in
order to help physicians provide better treatment recom￾mendations.
The METABRIC dataset consists of gene expression
data and clinical features for 1,980 patients, and 57.72
percent have an observed death due to breast cancer
with a median survival time of 116 months [29]. We
prepare the dataset in line with the Immunohistochem￾ical 4 plus Clinical (IHC4+C) test, which is a com￾mon prognostic tool for evaluating treatment options for
breast cancer patients [30]. We join the 4 gene indicators
(MKI67, EGFR, PGR, and ERBB2) with the a patient’s clin￾ical features (hormone treatment indicator, radiotherapy
indicator, chemotherapy indicator, ER-positive indicator,
age at diagnosis). We then reserved 20 percent of the
patients as the test set.
Table 1 shows that DeepSurv performs better than both
the CPH and RSF. This result demonstrates not only
DeepSurv’s ability to model the risk effects of gene expres￾sion data but also shows the potential for future research
of DeepSurv as a comparable prognostic tool to common
medical tests such as the IHC4+C.
Treatment recommender system experiments
In this section, we perform two experiments to demon￾strate the effectiveness of DeepSurv’s treatment rec￾ommender system. First, we simulate treatment data
by including an additional covariate to the simulated
data from “Nonlinear experiment” section. Second, after
demonstrating DeepSurv’s modeling and recommenda￾tion capabilities, we apply the recommender system to a
real dataset used to study the effects of hormone treat￾ment on breast cancer patients. We show that DeepSurv
can successfully provide personalized treatment recom￾mendations. We conclude that if all patients follow the
network’s recommended treatment options, we would
gain a significant increase in patients’ lifespans.
Simulated treatment data
We uniformly assign a treatment group τ ∈ {0, 1} to each
simulated patient in the dataset. All of the patients in
group τ = 0 were ‘unaffected’ by the treatment (e.g. given
a placebo) and have a constant log-risk function h0(x).
The other group τ = 1 is prescribed a treatment with
Gaussian effects (Eq. 9) and has a log-risk function h1(x)
with λmax = 10 and r = 0.5.
Figure 4 illustrates the network’s success in modeling
both treatments’ log-risk functions for patients. Figure 4a
plots the true log-risk distribution h(x). As expected,
Fig. 4b shows that the network models a constant log￾risk for a patient in treatment τ = 0, independent of
a patient’s covariates. Figure 4c shows how DeepSurv
models the Gaussian effects of a patient’s covariates on

predicted log-risk hˆ0(x) for patients with treatment group τ = 0. c The network’s predicted log-risk hˆ1(x) for patients in treatment group τ = 1
their treatment log-risk. To further quantify these results,
Table 1 shows that DeepSurv has the largest concor￾dance index. Because the network accurately reconstructs
the risk function, we expect that it will provide accurate
treatment recommendations for new patients.
In Fig. 5, we plot the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for
both the Recommendation and Anti-Recommendation
subset for each method. Figure 5a shows that the sur￾vival curve for the Recommendation subset is shifted to
the right, which signifies an increase in survival time for
the population following DeepSurv’s recommendations.
This is further quantified by the median survival times
summarized in Table 2. The p-value of DeepSurv’s recom￾mendations is less than 0.000090, and we can reject the
null hypothesis that DeepSurv’s recommendations would
not affect the population’s survival time. As shown in
Table 2, the subset of patients that follow RSF’s recom￾mendations have a shorter survival time than those who
do not follow RSF’s recommended treatment. Therefore,
we could take the RSF’s recommendations and provide the
patients with the opposite treatment option to increase
median survival time; however, Fig. ?? shows that that
improvement would not be statistically valid. While both
methods of DeepSurv and RSF are able to compute treat￾ment interaction terms, DeepSurv is more successful in
recommending personalized treatments.
Rotterdam & German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG)
We first train DeepSurv on breast cancer data from the
Rotterdam tumor bank [31]. and construct a recom￾mender system to provide treatment recommendations to
patients from a study by the German Breast Cancer Study
Group (GBSG) [32]. The Rotterdam tumor bank dataset
contains records for 1546 patients with node-positive
breast cancer, and nearly 90 percent of the patients have
an observed death time. The testing data from the GBSG
contains complete data for 686 patients (56 percent are
censored) in a randomized clinical trial that studied the
effects of chemotherapy and hormone treatment on sur￾vival rate. We preprocess the data as outlined by [33].

given the treatment concordant with a method’s recommended treatment (Recommendation) and the subset of patients who were not

The bold faced numbers signify the best performing algorithm
We first validate DeepSurv’s performance against the
RSF and CPH baseline. We then plot the two survival
curves: the survival times of those who followed the rec￾ommended treatment and those who did not. If the rec￾ommender system is effective, we expect the population
with the recommended treatments to survive longer than
those who did not take the recommended treatment.
Table 1 shows that DeepSurv provides an improved pre￾dictive ability relative to the CPH and RSF. In Fig. 6,
we plot the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for both the
Recommendation subset and the Anti-Recommendation
subset for each method. Figure 6a shows that the sur￾vival curve for DeepSurv’s Recommendation subset is
statistically significant from the Anti-recommendation
subset, and Table 2 shows that DeepSurv’s recommenda￾tions increase the median survival time of the population.
Figure 6b demonstrates that RSF is unable to provide sig￾nificant treatment recommendations, despite an increase
in median survival times (see Table 2). The results of this
experiment demonstrate not only DeepSurv’s superior
modeling capabilities but also validate DeepSurv’s abil￾ity in providing personalized treatment recommendations
on real clinical data. Moreover, we can train DeepSurv
on survival data from one clinical study and transfer
the learnings to provide personalized treatment recom￾mendations to a different population of breast cancer
patients.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the use of deep learn￾ing in survival analysis allows for: (i) higher performance
due to the flexibility of the model, and (ii) effective treat￾ment recommendations based on the predicted effect of
treatment options on an individual’s risk. We validated
that DeepSurv predicts patients’ risk mostly as well as
or better than other linear and nonlinear survival meth￾ods. We experimented on increasingly complex survival
datasets and demonstrated that DeepSurv computes com￾plex and nonlinear features without a priori selection
or domain expertise. We then demonstrated that Deep￾Surv is superior in predicting personalized treatment rec￾ommendations compared to the state-of-the-art survival
method of random survival forests. We also released a
Python module that implements DeepSurv and scripts for
running reproducible experiments in Docker, see [34] for
more details.
Discussion
The success of DeepSurv’s predictive, modeling,
and recommending abilities paves the way for
future research in deep neural networks and survival
analysis. DeepSurv can lead to various extensions, such
as the use of convolution neural networks to predict
risk with medical imaging. With more research at scale,
DeepSurv has the potential to supplement traditional
survival analysis methods and become a standard method
for medical practitioners to study and recommend
personalized treatment options.
Appendix A
Experimental details
We run all linear CPH regression, Kaplan-Meier esti￾mations, c-index statistics, and log-rank tests using the
Lifelines Python package. DeepSurv is implemented in

(α = .05) for the patients who were given the treatment concordant with a method’s recommended treatment (Recommendation) and the subset
of patients who were not (Anti-Recommendation). We perform a log-rank test to validate the significance between each set of survival curves.

Theano with the Python package Lasagne. We use the R
package randomForestSRC to fit RSFs. All experiments
are run using Docker containers such that the experi￾ments are easily reproducible. We use the FloydHub base
image for the DeepSurv docker container.
The hyper-parameters of the network include: the depth
and size of the network, learning rate, 2 regularization
coefficient, dropout rate, exponential learning rate decay
constant , and momentum. We run the Random hyper￾parameter optimization search as proposed in [23] using
the Python package Optunity. We use the Sobol solver [35,
36] to sample each hyper-parameter from a predefined
range and evaluate the performance of the configuration
using k-means cross validation (k = 3). We then choose
the configuration with the largest validation C-index to
avoid models that overfit. The hyper-parameters we use
in all experiments are summarized in the next “Model
Hyper-parameters” section.
Model Hyper-parameters
As described in “Experimental details” section, we tune
DeepSurv’s hyper-parameters by running a random
hyper-parameter search using the Python package Optu￾nity. The table below summarizes the hyper-parameters
we use for each experiment’s DeepSurv network.
We applied inverse time decay to the learning rate at
each epoch:
decayed_LR := LR
1 + epoch · lr_decay_rate . (10)
Appendix B
CPH recommender function
Let each patient in the dataset have a set of n features
xn, in which one feature is a treatment variable x0 = τ .
The CPH model estimates the log-risk function as a lin￾ear combination of the patient’s features hˆβ(x) = βTx =
β0τ + β1x1 + ... + βnxn. When we calculate the rec￾ommender function for the CPH model, we show that
the model returns a constant function independent of the
patient’s features:
recij(x) = log	λ(t; x|τ = i)
λ(t; x|τ = j)


= log	λ0(t) · eβ0i+β1x1+...+βnxn
λ0(t) · eβ0j+β1x1+...+βnxn


= log 
eβ0i+β1x1+...+βnxn−(β0j+β1x1+...+βnxn)

= β0i − β0j
= β0(i − j).
(11)
The CPH will recommend all patients to choose the
same treatment option based on whether the model
calculates the weight β0 to be positive or negative.
Thus, the CPH would not be providing personalized
treatment recommendations. Instead, the CPH deter￾mines whether the treatment is effective and, if so,
then recommending it to all patients. In an exper￾iment, when we calculate which patients took the
CPH’s recommendation, the Recommendation and Anti￾Recommendation subgroups will be equal to the control
and treatment groups. Therefore, calculating treatment
recommendations using the CPH provides little value
to the experiments in terms of comparing the models’
recommendations.
Appendix C
Simulated data generation
Each patient’s baseline information x is drawn from a
uniform distribution on [ −1, 1)d. For datasets that also
involve treatment, the patient’s treatment status τx is
drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.5.
The Cox proportional hazard model assumes that the
baseline hazard function λ0(t) is shared across all patients.
The initial death time is generated according to an expo￾nential random variable with a mean μ = 5, which we
denote u ∼ Exp(5). The individual death time is then
generated by

These times are then right censored at an end time to
represent the end of a trial. The end time T0 is chosen such
that 90 percent of people have an observed death time.
Because we cannot observe any T beyond the end time
threshold, we denote the final observed outcome time
Z = min(T, T0).
