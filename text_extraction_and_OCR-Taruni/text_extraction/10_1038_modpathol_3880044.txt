Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a nuclear
homeodomain transcription factor that is expressed
in the developing thyroid, respiratory epithelium,
and diencephalon. TTF-1 is thought to be expressed
specifically in pulmonary or thyroid neoplasms, and
it is expressed in a significant subset of pulmonary
non–small cell carcinomas, small cell carcinomas,
and carcinoids but not in nonpulmonary, non–
small cell carcinomas. Neuroendocrine tumors
from sites other than the lung have not been eval￾uated for TTF-1 expression. We examined TTF-1
expression using immunohistochemistry on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 49
gastrointestinal carcinoids; 15 pancreatic islet cell
tumors; 21 paragangliomas; 8 medullary thyroid
carcinomas; 7 small cell carcinomas of the uterine
cervix; 4 prostate, 4 bladder, and 6 Merkel cell (pri￾mary cutaneous neuroendocrine) carcinomas; and
1 renal carcinoma. No gastrointestinal carcinoid tu￾mor, pancreatic islet cell tumor, paraganglioma, or
Merkel cell carcinoma expressed TTF-1. All of the
medullary thyroid carcinomas strongly expressed
TTF-1. However, 44% of nonpulmonary small cell
carcinomas were also TTF-1 positive, including four
of four prostate, two of four bladder, and one of
seven cervical small cell carcinomas. We conclude
that TTF-1 expression is not specific for small cell
carcinomas of pulmonary origin and should not be
used to distinguish primary from metastatic small
cell carcinomas in extrapulmonary sites. However,
TTF-1 expression may be useful in distinguishing
Merkel cell carcinomas and cutaneous metastasis of
small cell carcinomas. Among well-differentiated
neuroendocrine tumors, TTF-1 expression seems to
be present only in carcinoid tumors of the lung and
medullary carcinomas of the thyroid and may be of
differential diagnostic value when dealing with a
metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tu￾mor.

The differential diagnosis of neuroendocrine tu￾mors in the lung, liver, lymph nodes, or even the
gastrointestinal tract may include both primary and
metastatic lesions, particularly in those patients
with a history of tumor elsewhere in the body.
These tumors may have nearly identical his￾topathologic features, irrespective of the site of or￾igin, and identification of the primary tumor loca￾tion may be impossible on purely morphologic
grounds (1, 2). Immunohistochemistry may be
valuable in the evaluation of these lesions through
the detection of specific hormonal products (e.g.,
glucagon in metastatic glucagonoma) (1, 2). How￾ever, this technique has limitations in carcinoid
tumors that produce only nonspecific products,
such as chromogranin, or in poorly differentiated
tumors that do not produce a detectable hormone
(1, 2).
Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a 38-kDa
homeodomain containing nuclear protein that is a
member of the Nkx2 gene family, plays a role in
transcriptional activation during embryogenesis in
the thyroid, diencephalon, and respiratory epithe￾lium (3–5). TTF-1 expression has been demon￾strated in neoplasms of the lungs and thyroid (6 –9)
and more recently, in the C-cells of the thyroid,
where it modulates the expression of several genes

involved in calcium homeostasis (10, 11). Recently,
we have demonstrated expression of TTF-1 in a
significant subset of pulmonary neuroendocrine tu￾mors, including 35% of typical carcinoids, 100% of
atypical carcinoids, 75% of large cell neuroendo￾crine tumors, and 95% of small cell carcinomas
(12). TTF-1 expression has not been investigated in
neuroendocrine tumors that arise outside the lung,
such as gastrointestinal carcinoids, pancreatic islet
cell tumors, paragangliomas, extrapulmonary small
cell carcinomas, or Merkel cell carcinomas. Addi￾tionally, whether TTF-1 is expressed in medullary
carcinomas of the thyroid remains unknown. We
hypothesized that TTF-1 expression might be useful
in distinguishing pulmonary from nonpulmonary
neuroendocrine tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from
49 gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors; 15 pancreatic
islet cell tumors; 21 paragangliomas; 8 medullary
thyroid carcinomas; 7 cervical, 4 prostatic, 4 blad￾der, and 6 Merkel cell carcinomas; and 1 renal small
cell carcinoma were retrieved from the archives of
the Departments of Pathology of the University of
Washington Medical Center, University of Arkansas
for Medical Sciences, and Emory University Hospi￾tal. Neuroendocrine differentiation had been con￾firmed in all tumors during routine pathologic eval￾uation, using immunocytochemistry (antibodies to
chromogranin A, synaptophysin, or neuron-specific
enolase), electron microscopy, and/or serum ex￾pression of hormones. None of the patients with
small cell carcinoma had clinical history or radio￾graphic evidence of a pulmonary primary. Immu￾nohistochemical studies were performed at both
the University of Washington (77 cases) and Emory
University (38 cases).
For immunohistochemistry, deparaffinized sections
were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody to
TTF-1 (1:20; Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA). Nega￾tive controls consisted of substitutions of mouse ascites
fluid for the primary antibody. Sections were subjected
to heat-induced epitope retrieval for 18 min in citrate
buffer (pH 6.0), using a microwave oven (University of
Washington) or a vegetable steamer (Emory University).
Antigens were localized using an avidin-biotin
method with 3,39-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen,
with or without nickel chloride enhancement. Cases
were independently evaluated by two pathologists
(SNA, ALF); cases with any definite nuclear staining
were scored as positive. Granular perinuclear (not
nuclear) staining was also seen in the normal small
and large bowel epithelium, the pancreatic ductal and
acinar cells, and some of the gastrointestinal carci￾noid and pancreatic islet cell tumors; this staining was
not scored as positive. A section of a pulmonary ad￾enocarcinoma was used as a positive control.
RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, no gastrointestinal carci￾noid, pancreatic islet cell tumor, paraganglioma, or
Merkel cell carcinoma expressed TTF-1 (Fig. 1). A
significant subset of small cell carcinomas of the
prostate (100%), bladder (50%), and cervix (14%)
revealed strong nuclear expression of TTF-1 (Figs. 2
and 3). The staining intensity in these cases was
comparable to that observed in small cell carcino￾mas of pulmonary origin (12). All medullary thyroid
carcinomas were strongly positive for TTF-1. In all
positive cases, more than 10% of the tumor cells
expressed TTF-1. There were no differences in in￾tensity or distribution of staining by anatomic site.
There were no significant differences between the
cases that received microwave or steam heat￾induced epitope retrieval.
DISCUSSION
We have recently shown TTF-1 expression in the
great majority of neuroendocrine tumors of the
lung, including typical carcinoids, atypical pulmo￾nary carcinoids, large cell neuroendocrine tumors,
and small cell carcinomas (12). No prior study has
evaluated TTF-1 expression in neuroendocrine tu￾mors of nonpulmonary origin, including medullary
carcinoma of the thyroid.
Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors and pancreatic
islet cell tumors are thought to originate from neu￾roendocrine cells present within the normal gastro￾intestinal or pancreatic ductal epithelium, respec￾tively (13–15). Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are
thought to arise from Kulchitsky’s type neuroendo￾crine cells present within the bronchial epithelium

(16). Embryologically, carcinoids can be separated
into foregut (pulmonary, pancreas, stomach, and
proximal duodenum), midgut (distal duodenum,
jejunum, ileum, appendix, and proximal colon),
and hindgut tumors (distal colon and rectum) (2).
Gastrointestinal and pulmonary carcinoid tumors
have very similar immunohistochemical profiles
with regard to expression of chromogranin, S-100
protein, synaptophysin, and CD56 (neural cell ad￾hesion molecule, NCAM), although foregut and
hindgut tumors differ somewhat in terms of CD56
and chromogranin expression (2). Pulmonary car￾cinoid tumors have been shown to express seroto￾nin, pancreatic-like polypeptides, bombesin, and
adrenocorticotropin hormone (17). This makes dif￾ferentiating metastatic carcinoid tumors from the
lung or gastrointestinal tract problematic with im￾munohistochemistry.

240 Modern Pathology

As we have shown, gastrointestinal carcinoids
(including those of foregut origin) and pancreatic
islet cell tumors do not express TTF-1. This finding
may be of potential diagnostic use in determining
the site of origin of a metastatic well-differentiated
neuroendocrine tumor. The results of our current
and previous studies of pulmonary carcinoids (12)
suggest that TTF-1 expression is a very specific but
not highly sensitive marker of pulmonary carci￾noids. These results also suggest that pulmonary
carcinoids may arise from a different progenitor cell
than do other neuroendocrine neoplasms of similar
foregut origin, such as the duodenum and pan￾creas.
Paragangliomas that arise from the widespread
paraganglia of the autonomic nervous system may
express chromogranin and neuron-specific eno￾lase, as well as catecholamines and other neurose￾cretory products (18, 19). TTF-1 expression has not
been evaluated in paragangliomas. The tumors in
our study, some of which were metastases, all
tested negative for TTF-1. Because paragangliomas
are usually vimentin positive and cytokeratin neg￾ative, they are usually easily distinguished immu￾nohistochemically from carcinoids, which are al￾most always cytokeratin positive. However, a subset
of paragangliomas, particularly those of cauda
equina origin, does express cytokeratin and may be
easily mistaken for carcinoids (20).
Merkel cell carcinomas (primary cutaneous small
cell neuroendocrine carcinomas) are associated
with much better survival rates than pulmonary or
extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, and al￾though similar histologically to other small cell car￾cinomas, they have unique immunohistochemical
features (21, 22). Most Merkel cell carcinomas co￾express cytokeratins and neurofilament, and have
been shown to express cytokeratin 20, whereas the
majority of other small cell carcinomas (with the
exception of salivary small cell carcinomas) do not
(21, 22). Although the number of Merkel cell carci￾nomas in our study is small, our results suggest that
TTF-1 is not expressed in Merkel cell carcinomas,
emphasizing the unique nature of this tumor and
suggesting a role for TTF-1 in differentiating be￾tween Merkel cell carcinoma and the cutaneous
metastasis of a visceral small cell carcinoma.
The histogenesis of extrapulmonary small cell
carcinomas is controversial, with some theories
suggesting that they arise from multipotent progen￾itor cells (23, 24). Whereas we hypothesized that
TTF-1 expression would be limited to pulmonary
small cell carcinomas, our data show that this is not
the case. Overall, 44% of primary small cell carci￾nomas of sites other than the lung expressed TTF-1,
with a staining intensity comparable to that ob￾served in lung tumors. The significance of TTF-1
expression in poorly differentiated tumors of non￾foregut origin is not certain, but it does suggest that
inferences about the “cell of origin” of poorly dif￾ferentiated neuroendocrine tumors (versus carci￾noids) cannot be made on the basis of TTF-1 ex￾pression (7). We have also observed focal nuclear
TTF-1 expression in an adenosquamous carcinoma
of the colon, with partial neuroendocrine differen￾tiation (data not shown).
TTF-1 is uniformly expressed in normal thyroid
follicular epithelium, follicular adenomas, follicular
carcinomas, and papillary carcinomas, but not in
anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (8). Expression of
TTF-1 mRNA has recently been shown in thyroid
C-cells and in the parathyroid chief cells (11). How￾ever, expression of TTF-1 has not been previously
studied in medullary carcinomas. We found TTF-1
expression in all of the medullary carcinomas that
we studied, suggesting that TTF-1 may be a useful
adjunct to calcitonin immunostaining in the diag￾nosis of these tumors.
In conclusion, the results of this study demon￾strate that TTF-1 expression is not limited to small
cell carcinomas of the lung but may be present in
small cell carcinomas of various primary sites, ex￾cept the skin (Merkel cell carcinomas). This is in
contrast to the pattern of expression seen in better￾differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, in which
TTF expression seems to be a specific if not an
especially sensitive marker of pulmonary and atyp￾ical carcinoids. The high frequency of expression of
TTF-1 in extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas
strongly disputes the use of this marker to distin￾guish primary from metastatic small cell carcino￾mas, though it may be useful in distinguishing Mer￾kel cell carcinoma from cutaneous metastasis of
small cell carcinomas.
