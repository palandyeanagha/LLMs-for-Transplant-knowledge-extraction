Abstract
Background
This study evaluated performance of two hepatitis C virus (HCV) rapid diagnostic tests
(RDTs) performed by intended users in resource-limited settings.
Methods
Testing was conducted at three facilities in two countries (Georgia, Cambodia) using
matched fingerstick whole blood, plasma and serum samples. Investigational RDTs were
compared with a composite reference standard (CRS) comprised of three laboratory tests,
and a reference RDT.
Results
In matched samples from 489 HCV positive and 967 HCV negative participants, specificity
with both investigational RDTs was high using either reference method (�98.4% in all sam￾ple types). Sensitivity was lower in whole blood versus plasma and serum for both RDTs
compared with the CRS (86.5–91.4% vs 97.5–98.0% and 97.3–97.1%) and reference RDT
(93.6–97.8% vs 100% and 99.4%). Sensitivity improved when considering only samples
with detectable HCV viral load.
Conclusion
Sensitivity was highest in serum and plasma versus whole blood. The World Health Organi￾zation prequalification criterion (�98%) was narrowly missed by both RDTs in serum, and
one in plasma, possibly due to the intended user factor. Performance in whole blood was

Introduction
World Health Organization (WHO) member states have committed to the elimination of viral
hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 [1]. Screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV), a patho￾gen that affects approximately 71 million people worldwide (2015 estimate), is critical to the
success of these targets, especially as only an estimated 20% of infected people are aware of
their HCV status [1]. According to WHO recommendations, screening should be performed
through the detection of HCV-specific antibodies using a single quality-assured serological in
vitro diagnostic test, which can be either a laboratory-based immunoassay or a rapid diagnostic
test (RDT) [2]. A positive RDT test is followed by confirmatory testing for viraemic infection
via detection of HCV viral load (VL) or core antigen [2].
Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have the highest burden of HCV, representing
over 70% of the global total [3]. However, access to laboratory-based testing services in these
settings is often limited by the absence of suitable equipment, stringent training requirements
and sample or patient transportation challenges. RDTs, which can be used outside of the labo￾ratory, are an attractive alternative due to their affordability, ease of use and feasibility of utiliz￾ing various sample types, including plasma, serum, fingerstick whole blood or oral fluid [2].
WHO prequalification status intents to indicate that an RDT is likely to have reliable perfor￾mance in LMICs, as it requires the generation of performance data in LMICs in intended use
settings by intended users, with at least a portion of these data generated using freshly collected
samples [4]. However, of the many commercially available HCV RDTs, only four have
obtained WHO prequalification status to date [5]. The scarcity of quality-assured RDTs is an
important barrier to HCV screening in LMICs on a large scale [6].
A previous retrospective study evaluated the performance of 13 HCV RDTs in archived
plasma samples [7]. In this study, the majority of RDTs exhibited performance in line with
WHO criteria for selection of HCV diagnostics in samples from patients without human
immunodeficiency virus [HIV] co-infection (sensitivity �98% and specificity of �97% in
serum or plasma samples [8, 9]). Sensitivity was lower in samples from HIV infected partici￾pants compared with samples from HIV uninfected participants; interestingly, the majority of
false negative HIV infected samples did not have detectable HCV VL/core antigen. However,
the retrospective study was performed on archived samples by highly trained staff in evalua￾tion laboratories, a setting that does not fully reflect the reality in which HCV RDTs are
intended or likely to be used. In the field, HCV RDTs are most likely to be performed in pri￾mary care or screening facilities by staff with limited training, using whole blood by finger
prick as the most common sample type. Data on RDT performance in whole blood is often
limited or absent, particularly in comparison with matched samples of other types.
The objective of the current study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of HCV
RDTs in a real-world setting. Performance was assessed in fresh, matched whole blood, plasma
and serum samples that were collected and tested in resource-limited settings by intended
users, i.e. nurses and primary healthcare personnel.

Beijing, China) and the First Response HCV card test (Premier Medical Corporation Ltd.,
Mumbai, India). Operational characteristics of these tests are shown in S1 Table. These RDTs
were selected as they met WHO prequalification criteria in archived plasma samples in the
previous study [7], and the manufacturers had demonstrated a commitment to seeking WHO
prequalification status.
Testing was conducted at three primary healthcare facilities in two countries. These were: a
general outpatient clinic at the Sihanouk Hospital Center of Hope (SHCH), a non-governmen￾tal hospital providing low-cost medical care in Phnom Penh, Cambodia; an HCV screening
facility at the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC) in Tbilisi, Geor￾gia; and an opioid substitution treatment facility at the Centre for Mental Health and Preven￾tion of Addiction (CMHPA), also in Tbilisi, Georgia.
RDTs were tested on three sample types: fingerstick whole blood, ethylenediaminetetraace￾tic acid (EDTA) plasma, and serum (matched samples), all collected and tested on the same
day. Performance was compared with three WHO prequalified laboratory reference tests, of
which two were enzyme immunoassays (EIAs; Murex Anti-HCV version 4.0, Fujirebio
INNOTEST HCV Ab IV) and one was a line immunoassay (LIA; Fujirebio INNO-LIA HCV
Score), using a previously described composite reference standard (CRS) that incorporated the
results of all three reference tests [7]. The algorithm was based on WHO prequalification eval￾uation protocols, with the final decision being based on the LIA test result. A signal-to-cut-off
ratio of �1 (based on the measured optical density) was used for the EIAs; interpretation of
LIA results was performed according to manufacturer instructions. Performance of the two
investigational RDTs was also compared with a reference RDT, the WHO prequalified SD Bio￾line HCV test (Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff, USA; operational characteristics shown in S1
Table).
Reference testing was conducted at diagnostic reference laboratories (R. Lugar Center for
Public Health Research, Tbilisi, Georgia and Biobykhin Medical Analysis Laboratory, Phnom
Penh, Cambodia) using plasma samples, collected and tested on fresh or non-frozen samples
(stored at 4˚C) within seven days of sample collection, in accordance with manufacturer
instructions for use. Confirmatory testing to obtain HCV VL and genotyping information was
performed on fresh plasma samples. Tests used for determination of HCV VL were the Real￾Time HCV viral load assay (Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff, USA; limit of detection [LOD] 12
IU/mL) in Georgia and the AccuPid HCV Real-time PCR Quantification Kit (Khoa Thuong
Biotechnology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; LOD 21 IU/mL) in Cambodia. Testing was per￾formed between July 2019 and December 2019. Ethics approval for this study was obtained
from the Cambodian National Ethics Committee for Health Research and the Georgian
National Center for Disease Control and Public Health Institutional Review Board. Written
informed consent was obtained from all study participants.
Participant recruitment
Participants providing samples were required to be aged �18 years, have no history of HCV
treatment (past or present), and be willing to perform an HIV test. At SHCH in Cambodia, all
individuals visiting the facility as outpatients were invited to participate in the study until the
daily recruitment target (~10 participants/day) was met. At CMHPA and NCDC in Georgia,
all individuals visiting the facility were invited to participate. Additionally, known HCV posi￾tive individuals from the site databases were contacted and invited to participate. Participant
demographic and medical history information was collected, including age, HIV status, other
medications and infections, and recent vaccinations. Counselling related to HCV test results
was offered, and all participants received HCV confirmatory testing. Participants were

assigned to the HCV positive and HCV negative group based on the result of the composite
reference standard. If positive, Cambodian participants were given free treatment; Georgian
participants received treatment via the national HCV treatment programme. The HCV status
of participants was not known to RDT testers.
RDT performance assessments
Every sample type was tested and interpreted once per RDT. Invalid results were repeated once,
and plasma and serum samples were repeated in duplicate if the initial result was different to
the reference RDT SD Bioline. Two lots of each RDT were used; the complete sample popula￾tion was tested to approximately 50% with lot 1 and 50% with lot 2. Testers were nurses and pri￾mary healthcare personnel who are intended to perform RDT screening as per each countries’
healthcare system. A number of different testers performed the tests at each site. The number of
different testers for whole blood samples was 6, 2 and 4 at SHCH, CMHPA and NCDC, respec￾tively. The corresponding numbers of testers for plasma and serum were 3, 2 and 3.
Data capture
Participant demographic, medical history, RDT and LIA results were initially captured on
paper case report forms. Viral load and genotype results, as well as EIA results were captured
in electronic format on the respective analyses platforms. All data were subsequently entered
into the electronic databased Open Clinica v4.0.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was the estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the two RDTs in each
of the three sample types, compared with the CRS. Sensitivity and specificity compared with
the reference RDT SD Bioline was a secondary outcome. For both outcomes, sensitivity and
specificity were calculated for the overall sample set, by country and in the subset of samples
with detectable HCV VL. Furthermore, statistical difference in performance between the sam￾ple types was assessed for both outcomes. Additionally, a multivariate analysis was performed
to evaluate the impact of different demographic factors on RDT sensitivity in whole blood.
Statistical analyses
For sample size calculations, sensitivity and specificity was assumed to be 90% for whole blood
and 95% for plasma and serum samples. However, using these assumptions, the minimum
sample sizes to achieve 80% power with a 95% CI of ±5% were lower than WHO Technical
Specification Series-7 (TSS-7) requirements of 400 HCV positive and 1000 HCV antibody and
RNA negative samples for diagnostic assessments of HCV RDTs [4]. Therefore, the TSS-7 val￾ues were used, with a 10% increase to account for sample exclusion due to indeterminate HCV
status with the CRS (based on experience from the previous study [7]). Final sample size tar￾gets were 440 HCV antibody positive (HCV positive) and 1,100 HCV antibody negative (HCV
negative) samples.
Point estimates with 95% confidence intervals based on Wilson’s score method, were calcu￾lated for sensitivity and specificity. A performance comparison was performed using Pearson’s
chi-square test with Bonferroni adjustment to estimate statistical differences in RDT perfor￾mance between sample types and by sample type between the two countries. Statistical analysis
was performed using R (version 3.6).
Covariates included in the multivariate logistic regression were age, gender, presence of
detectable viral load, HCV genotype and country. The model was applied separately for each

of the two investigational RDTs and the two reference methods (CRS and reference RDT SD
Bioline). Estimates of coefficients and p-values were calculated using glm function with bino￾mial logit specification in R.
Results
Population and sample characteristics
Of 1,540 individuals recruited, 11 were excluded, thus 1,529 samples of each type were pro￾vided in total. Characteristics of the individuals who provided samples are shown in Table 1.
Mean age ranged from 40.3 years at CMHPA to 51.8 years at SHCH. Of the 1,529 samples, 489
were HCV positive, 966 were HCV negative, and 74 were excluded due to indeterminate
results on the CRS (Fig 1). The number of HCV positive individuals encountered at NCDC in
Georgia was higher than expected, thus more HCV positive participants were recruited than
was anticipated in the predefined site enrolment targets.
HCV VL was detectable in 63% of HCV positive samples. HCV genotype 1, 1a and 1b were
the most common, followed by genotype 3 and genotype 6. However, there were no genotype
3 samples from Cambodia, and no genotype 6 samples from Georgia (Table 2).
Sensitivity and specificity versus composite reference standard
When compared with the CRS, specificity in the overall sample set was high (�98.4% for both
RDTs in all three sample types), with no differences observed across sample types (adjusted
p = 1.0) (Table 3). Sensitivity was lower in whole blood for the HCV-Ab Rapid test (86.5%)
and the First Response HCV card test (91.4%), versus plasma (97.5% and 98.0%, respectively,
adjusted p<0.001) and serum (97.3% and 97.1%, adjusted p<0.001 for the HCV-Ab Rapid test
and adjusted p = 0.005 for the First Response HCV card test). Sensitivity was higher in the sub￾set of samples with detectable HCV VL (>95.4% for both RDTs) for all sample types compared
with the overall sample set.
Sensitivity in whole blood was considerably lower in Cambodia than Georgia for both
RDTs (76.6% vs 94.2% for the HCV-Ab Rapid test and 85.0% vs 96.4% for the First Response
HCV card test; adjusted p<0.001; Table 4). The majority of whole blood false negative samples
with detectable VL from Cambodia were of genotype 1b, while those from Georgia were found

observed between countries for any sample type (adjusted p>0.215).
Sensitivity and specificity of the reference RDT SD Bioline compared with the CRS are

and serum (sensitivities of 95.1% and 93.9%, respectively), and even slightly lower in whole
blood (90.4%). However, contrary to the other tests, no differences between sensitivity in
whole blood samples and plasma or serum were observed for the reference RDT (adjusted p￾value >0.160 for sensitivity and specificity across different sample types).
Sensitivity and specificity versus RDT reference SD Bioline
When the RDT SD Bioline was used as a reference for comparison, specificity in the overall
sample set was high for both investigational RDTs in all three sample types (�96.8%), with no
differences observed across sample types (adjusted p>0.099) (Table 5). For both investiga￾tional RDTs, sensitivity in whole blood increased when using the SD Bioline RDT as a refer￾ence (93.6% for the HCV-Ab Rapid test and 97.8% for the First Response HCV card test) and
further increased in samples with detectable HCV VL (97.3% and 99.3%, respectively). Sensi￾tivity in plasma and serum was also slightly increased when the RDT SD Bioline was used as a
reference to evaluate performance (>99.4% for both sample types and RDTs). Sensitivity was
considerably lower for both RDTs in whole blood compared with plasma (adjusted p<0.001
for the HCV-Ab Rapid test and adjusted p = 0.060 for the First Response HCV card test), and
for the HCV-Ab Rapid test in whole blood compared with serum (adjusted p<0.001).

RDT sensitivity in whole blood was lower in Cambodia than in Georgia for both tests
(87.4% vs 97.8%, adjusted p<0.001 for the HCV-Ab Rapid test and 95.1% vs 99.6%, adjusted
p = 0.022 for the First Response HCV card test; Table 6). For both RDTs, specificity was lower
in Cambodia compared with Georgia in plasma (94.5% vs 99.4%, adjusted p<0.001 for the
HCV-Ab Rapid test and 96.6% vs 99.6%, adjusted p = 0.006 for the First Response HCV card
test) and serum (94.2% vs 99.6%, adjusted p<0.001 for the HCV-Ab Rapid test and 96.2% vs
99.8%, adjusted p<0.001 for the First Response HCV card test). There were no significant dif￾ferences between study countries in specificity for whole blood for either test. The multivari￾able logistic regression analysis showed that country was the most significant covariate
associated with sensitivity (S4 Table). Besides the country, only gender was associated with
sensitivity (slightly higher in males). However, gender only passed the threshold of statistical
significance in one case (HCV Ab Rapid compared with the CRS).
Discussion
In this prospective study of RDT performance in freshly collected whole blood, plasma and
serum samples, sensitivity of both the HCV-Ab Rapid test and the First Response HCV card
test was high in plasma and serum, but lower in whole blood. The concentration of antibodies
is likely to be lower in whole blood compared with plasma and serum, which could explain the

lower sensitivity seen in this study. However, although variability in sensitivity of HCV RDTs
in whole blood has been previously reported in some studies [10–13], those that directly com￾pared performance to plasma and serum have reported similar sensitivities across sample
types [14, 15]. Other aspects that may have affected sensitivity include the possibility that some
patients participating in the study had cleared their HCV infections, as evidenced by the
absence of detectable VL in around one third of samples, and the improved sensitivity in the
subset of samples with detectable viral load. Other studies have noted declines in HCV anti￾body levels following treatment-induced or spontaneous HCV clearance [16, 17], and a recent
study observed reduced sensitivity of an HCV RDT in subjects with treatment-induced clear￾ance [18]. While this would have affected all three sample types, it may have had a larger
impact on sensitivity in whole blood as antibody concentrations would have been closer to the
lower LOD compared with plasma and serum. Notably, WHO prequalification criteria are spe￾cifically designed for evaluation of plasma samples; no guidance is provided on expected per￾formance in whole blood [8]. Given the variability in sensitivity in whole blood with HCV
RDTs seen in earlier studies, achieving lower but acceptable sensitivity in whole blood may be
considered adequate performance for the two investigational RDTs evaluated here. Neverthe￾less, HCV screening programmes using these RDTs must take into account the potential for
lower performance in whole blood in real-world versus laboratory settings, particularly given

that testing of fingerstick blood in non-laboratory settings is likely to be a common usage of
these tests.
In our previous study using archived plasma samples [7], sensitivity of the investigational
RDTs met the WHO prequalification sensitivity criterion of �98% [8], when compared with
the laboratory-based CRS. In the current study, this criterion was narrowly missed by both
RDTs in serum, and one of two in plasma. Unlike the previous study, in this evaluation the
RDTs were performed by nurses and primary healthcare personnel, to represent a real-world
setting. As such, variability in conditions, such as low lighting when reading RDTs, and user
factors such as differences in line interpretation for low positive samples where lines can be
more difficult to identify, could have impacted test performance. Similar factors, as well as the
added technical challenge of fingerstick blood collection, may also have been a contributing
factor to the lower sensitivity in whole blood. The fact that specificity was high in all sample
types and sensitivity was close to WHO prequalification criteria in plasma and serum samples,
suggests that the RDTs perform well in real-world settings and are likely to be beneficial to
HCV screening programmes.
Consistent with our previous study in archived plasma samples [7], in this analysis, false
negatives mostly occurred in samples with undetectable HCV VL. However, in our previous

study this effect was more apparent in HCV and HIV coinfected samples [7]. As only four par￾ticipants in the current study were HIV positive, the effect of HCV VL on test performance in
this study was not linked to HIV. Other studies have reported similar observations of
improved HCV RDT performance in samples with detectable VL [19]. HCV VL testing is used
to confirm viraemic infection in people who test positive for HCV antibodies [2], thus these
samples represent participants who had active HCV infections. Because the sensitivity of the
investigational RDTs was higher in samples with detectable VL compared with the overall
sample set for all sample types, this provides some reassurance in the feasibility of using these
RDTs to detect HCV in the people in need of treatment.
RDT test performance in Cambodia was considerably lower than in Georgia, in terms of
sensitivity in whole blood compared with either reference test (CRS or reference RDT) and in
terms of specificity in serum and plasma compared with the RDT reference. Differences in
specificity when compared to the RDT reference might be explained by the lower sensitivity of
the SD Bioline RDT in serum and plasma samples from Cambodia, resulting in a higher num￾ber of apparent false positives for the investigational RDTs.
The reason for the lower sensitivity of the investigational RDTs in Cambodia is not clear.
Although the majority of false negative samples with detectable VL from Cambodia were of
genotype 1b, while those from Georgia were found across all genotypes, different methodolo￾gies were used at the different sites to determine HCV genotype, so it is difficult to determine
whether this represents a meaningful difference. A prozone effect, whereby the ability of anti￾bodies to form immune complexes is impaired at high concentrations, may also have resulted
in false negatives, as has been shown with other RDTs [20]. Alternatively, it is possible that
HCV positive participants from Cambodia with undetectable HCV VL had lower antibody
titres, as suggested by the fact that proportionally, there were more true positives in samples
with undetectable VL from Georgia compared with Cambodia (87.5% versus 50.6% for the
HCV-Ab Rapid test and 92.3% vs 63.3% for the First Response HCV card test). Historically,
the HCV epidemic in Cambodia has been largely driven through past unsafe medical practices
[21, 22], whereas Georgia has an ongoing HCV epidemic in injection drug users [23]. Addi￾tionally, one of the two centres in Georgia was an opioid substitution treatment facility, thus a
high proportion of Georgian participants would have been injection drug users. This suggests
a possibility that the between-country differences in sensitivity may be due to Cambodian par￾ticipants having generally cleared infections longer ago, while more Georgian participants had
ongoing infections. Previous studies have shown that HCV screening tests can provide dis￾crepant results in people with waning antibodies [24]. However, it was not possible to test this
hypothesis in this study, as it was not designed to recruit participants to represent the propor￾tionate occurrence of ongoing and past infections. Further research is needed to better under￾stand sensitivity differences across different population groups or HCV endemic areas.
It is interesting to note that the WHO prequalified RDT SD Bioline, used as a reference
RDT in this study, also had lower than expected sensitivity in whole blood in the overall sam￾ple set (including samples with and without detectable VL) when compared with the labora￾tory-based CRS. The quality of SD Bioline is well established [25, 26], thus this further
highlights how regional and demographic differences in population can impact on RDT per￾formance, even with established RDTs, and demonstrates the generally lower sensitivity of
RDTs compared with laboratory-based immunoassays as antibody screening tests.
Specificity was high in all sample types for both investigational RDTs when compared with
the CRS, meeting the WHO prequalification specificity criterion of �97% for HCV serology
RDTs in plasma or serum specimens [8]. Specificity also met this criterion when compared
with a WHO prequalified reference RDT test, except for one of two tests in plasma and serum
samples, for which specificity dropped just below the threshold.

A limitation of this study is the stringent CRS used, which led to 73 samples being excluded
from the study. While this provides confidence in the accuracy of the characterisation of the
samples used in the study, it is possible that inclusion of the excluded samples would have
affected sensitivity and specificity estimates. Additionally, the number of testers was higher for
whole blood than for plasma and serum at two out of the three study sites, which may have
contributed to differences in performance across sample types. However, previous studies
have suggested that provision of training substantially reduces user errors with RDTs [27].
Training was provided to all testers involved in this study, thus the impact of user variability is
likely to have been minimal.
In summary, both investigational RDTs performed well in fresh plasma and serum samples.
Although sensitivity in whole blood performance was lower, particularly in Cambodia, given
the potential impact of variability in HCV infection history, population drivers, conditions
and user factors, data from other studies evidencing variable performance in whole blood with
quality assured tests, and the fact that performance was similar to that of the reference RDT,
test performance can be considered adequate. Additionally, overall performance in whole
blood for samples with detectable VL was high. Comparative studies in different sample types
should be taken into consideration when selecting HCV RDTs for screening programmes,
bearing in mind that whole blood performance in real-world settings may be different from
expectations based on data generated in laboratory evaluations.
