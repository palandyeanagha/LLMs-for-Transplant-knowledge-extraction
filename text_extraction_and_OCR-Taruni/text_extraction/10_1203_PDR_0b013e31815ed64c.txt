ABSTRACT: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common
life-threatening gastrointestinal emergency encountered in the neo￾natal intensive care unit. Despite advances in neonatal care, NEC
remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among premature
infants. Epidemiologic studies have identified multiple factors that
increase an infant’s risk for the development of NEC, although
premature birth, bacterial colonization, and enteral feeding are
thought to play central roles in disease pathogenesis. Appreciating
factors that underlie the susceptibility of prematurely born infants to
NEC is important for the development of new strategies aimed at the
prevention and treatment of disease. In this review, we discuss
defense mechanisms in the intestine and discuss how these systems
may be insufficient in the prematurely born infant and thereby further
contribute to initiation of NEC. In addition, based on a review of the
literature, we suggest that, although numerous bacterial and viral
pathogens have been associated with NEC, no individual organism is
known to be responsible for disease. Finally, we comment on the
possible role for probiotics in promoting maturation of intestinal
defense mechanisms thereby attenuating or preventing the sequence
of events that lead to NEC. (Pediatr Res 63: 117–123, 2008)
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common sur￾gical emergency affecting the gastrointestinal tract of
infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The inci￾dence of NEC varies from 0.3 to 2.4 infants per 1000 live
births, with nearly 70% of cases occurring in infants born at
less than 36 wk of gestation. Although the national incidence
of NEC varies, NEC affects 2–5% of all premature infants and
accounts for up to 8% of all NICU admissions (1). The overall
mortality for NEC ranges from 10% to 50% but approaches
100% for infants with the most severe form of the disease,
characterized by full-thickness destruction of the intestine
leading to intestinal perforation, peritonitis, bacterial invasion,
and sepsis. The majority of these infants are extremely low
birth weight infants whose disease requires surgical interven￾tion (2). Despite optimal medical and surgical management of
NEC, infants that recover from disease may still require
prolonged hospitalization for related complications, such as
intestinal obstruction from scarring, liver failure due to a
prolonged requirement for total parenteral nutrition, short
bowel syndrome with intestinal failure and associated nutri￾tional deficiencies, and associated defects in growth and de￾velopment. Hence, NEC is a significant and growing heath
concern for prematurely born infants.
The events that lead to NEC in premature infants are
multifactorial and complex and include a history of a compli￾cated early neonatal course and poor intrauterine environment
and perinatal transition. The only consistent epidemiologic
risk factors for NEC are prematurity and a history of enteral
feeding, which may include a rapid advancement in feeding or
high osmotic strength formula feeding (2,3). Despite its pre￾dilection for premature infants, NEC has also been described
in infants born at term. The onset of disease in these infants
occurs within days of birth and is often associated with a
history of hypoxia such as in cyanotic congenital heart disease
or ischemia as single risk factors, suggesting that the patho￾genic sequence leading to NEC in term infants may be distinct
from that in the premature infant (3). Although recent evi￾dence supports that susceptibility to NEC, in premature in￾fants, is linked to gastrointestinal tract immaturity, the mech￾anisms whereby these factors incite or promote disease are
poorly defined. Understanding the defense mechanisms in the
premature intestine and their contribution to NEC susceptibil￾ity and pathogenesis is therefore of great importance. Eluci￾dation of these mechanisms may allow for the development of
strategies to target components that normally maintain integ￾rity of the epithelial barrier, and to prevent the characteristic
inflammatory cascade of NEC. This review will focus on
defense mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract of premature
infants and highlight how the state of immaturity in the
intestine may permit the initiation and propagation of inflam￾mation and pathogenesis in NEC.

INTESTINAL EPITHELIUM AND
NONIMMUNOLOGIC DEFENSE MECHANISMS
IN NEC
A primary function of the intestinal epithelium is to provide
a physical barrier between the inside of the body and the
luminal environment of the intestinal tract. Although epithelial
cells lining the intestine provide a physical barrier, barrier
function is incomplete in the absence of both nonimmunologic
and immunologic components of the intestinal defense sys￾tem. The nonimmunologic components include the mucus
layer overlying epithelial cells, which is composed of glyco￾proteins called mucins, as well as several peptides such as
trefoil factor, which are produced by goblet interspersed
within epithelial layer (4). The degree of mucus production
and its composition changes with postnatal age, in response to
bacterial challenge, following colonization by commensal mi￾crobial flora, and during intestinal epithelial restitution follow￾ing injury (5). Therefore, deficits in production or in the
composition of intestinal mucus or in its associated peptides
are hypothesized to contribute to the ability of bacteria to
invade and participate in the induction and propagation of
NEC (6). Tight junctions between epithelial cells maintain the
semipermeable properties of epithelial cells, thereby limiting
the passage of bacteria as well its permeability to a myriad of
other luminal macromolecules, while promoting the transcy￾tosis and absorption of macromolecules generated during the
normal processes of digestion. Immaturity in the composition
and function of tight junctions, through the interactions of
occludins and claudins (7) most likely accounts for the in￾creased permeability of the epithelial barrier in the newborn,
a finding that is further exaggerated in the premature infant.
Moreover, cytokines produced by epithelial cells and cells of
the innate and adaptive immune system in response to bacteria
and their products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), may
further disrupt the function of epithelial tight junctions,
thereby promoting the translocation of bacteria and their
products and other macromolecules (8). LPS, a known ligand
of TLR4, has been shown to stimulate transcription and
translation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines by epithelial
cells, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and IL-8,
all of which independently promote the inflammatory cascade
characteristic of NEC (9). Indeed, immature human epithelial
cells secrete more IL-8 than did a mature human epithelial cell
line (10). Additionally, inflammatory cytokines such as
TNF-, interferon (IFN)-, and IL-1, produced by epithelial
cells and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems (see
below), further contribute to epithelial barrier dysfunction
through the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), local overproduction of nitric oxide (NO), and the
generation of reactive nitrogen intermediate, peroxynitrite
(ONOO–
) (11). ONOO– has been shown to be directly respon￾sible for increases in epithelial cell apoptosis and death and
results in the decreases in epithelial cell proliferation and
migration characteristic of NEC.
Proper barrier function in the intestine also includes the
action of nonimmunologic defense mechanisms, such as phys￾ical and chemical factors at the epithelial-luminal interface,
including acid secretion by gastric enterochromaffin cells, bile
salt production by the liver, and the release of proteolytic
enzymes by the pancreas in concert with the regular peristaltic
contractions along the length of the intestine. Gastric acidity
provides a first-line defense against bacterial passage into the
proximal intestine. The premature human infant’s gastric pH
is initially high and then lowers toward mature levels with
increasing age, ultimately reaching pH of 4 (12). In full￾term infants and adults, migrating motor complexes propagate
as waves along the intestine; however, these complexes are
not present until approximately 34 wk of gestation (13).
Disordered peristalsis in premature infants may therefore con￾tribute to stasis of intestinal luminal contents and bacterial
overgrowth, particularly in concert with formula feeding.
Thus, pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators produced by
epithelial cells in conjunction with cells of the innate and
adaptive immune system compound baseline defects and im￾maturity in barrier function associated with the premature
infant at birth, thereby promoting the inflammatory cascade
characteristic of NEC.
INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNOLOGIC
DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND NEC
The gastrointestinal tract is home to the largest lymphoid tissue
in the body and is responsible for coordinating immunologic
defense mechanisms between the adaptive and innate immune
systems (14). The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) con￾sists of cells of the adaptive immune system called lymphocytes,
as well as cells of the innate immune system, including resident
tissue macrophages, dendritic cells, specialized epithelial cells
called M cells overlying the Peyer’s patches, and Paneth cells
located in the crypt region of the intestine.
Macrophages are well-recognized phagocytic cells of the
gut. However, both macrophages and dendritic cells act as
professional antigen-presenting cells (APC), directly sampling
antigens from within the lumen of the bowel, as well as
functioning in the uptake of antigens processed by the M cell
epithelium overlying Peyer’s patches. In addition, profes￾sional APC, M cells, and epithelial cells lining the gut func￾tion as nonprofessional APC, presenting antigens to resident
lymphocytes (15). The majority of antigens sampled directly
from the lumen must be processed before their presentation to
the cells of the adaptive immune system (16). Antigen degra￾dation, processing, and presentation are vital steps in the
initiation of an immune response. The processing and presen￾tation of antigens is less efficient in the newborn, thereby
reducing the ability of the adaptive and innate immune system
to detect and respond to pathogenic organisms. Paneth cells
produce a variety of antibacterial substances, including de￾fensins, lysozymes, secretory phospholipase A2, and lectins.
Defensins are small cationic peptides with broad-spectrum
antimicrobial actions (17,18). Paneth cell secretion is stimu￾lated by bacteria or by components of bacterial cell walls, such
as LPS and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (19). In a study by
Salzman et al. (20), expression of -defensin was found at
significantly lower levels during fetal life when compared
with the term newborn and adult. Therefore, the decreased

production of antibacterial products by Paneth cells may
predispose premature infants to bacterial overgrowth, thus
allowing NEC to develop. Although polymorphonuclear leu￾kocytes (PMN) are not regular inhabitants of the healthy
intestine, an increased number of PMN may be detected in the
intestinal epithelium early in NEC. PMN production by the
bone marrow and function is impaired in the newborn, poten￾tially contributing to intestinal bacterial overgrowth and inva￾sion (21). Likewise, the inflammatory cascade induced by
bacteria may include a reduced oxidative burst in the prema￾ture infant due to low levels of NADPH, thereby reducing the
function of the innate immune system (22).
Lymphocytes, including B and T cells, are found dispersed
throughout the intestinal wall and lymphoid aggregates. Intes￾tinal intraepithelial lymphocytes are T cells that reside be￾tween enterocytes. Both subsets are found in the lamina
propria, as well as in defined lymphoid structures, including
Peyer’s patches, small lymphoid aggregates, and mesenteric
lymph nodes. Despite considerable development of human T
and B cells during fetal life, complete maturation of the
systemic and intestinal immune system occurs after birth and
in response to colonization by commensal microbial flora (23).
The adult human small intestine contains 200 –300 Peyer’s
patches composed of germinal centers with distinct B and T
cell zones. Although Peyer’s patches are present in the new￾born, they are reduced in number and size and lack germinal
centers. Furthermore, the newborn lamina propria is largely
devoid of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-secreting plasma cells.
IgA, which is normally secreted into the mucus layer, is a
potent inhibitor of bacterial and viral epithelial attachment. As
human intestinal IgA production does not peak until 4 y of
age, a relative deficiency of IgA contributes to the suscepti￾bility of the newborn to infections at the mucosal surface (24).
Additionally, T cells in the newborn are less responsive to
antigenic stimulation and have a decreased proliferative re￾sponse to a variety of mitogenic stimuli (25). Therefore, it is
plausible that intestinal immune system of the premature
infant (similar to the systemic immune system has a reduced
capacity to control or respond to the overgrowth and invasion
by pathogenic and commensal bacteria that is characteristic of
infants with NEC.
BACTERIA AND THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE
PATHOGENESIS OF NEC
Whether bacteria are primary in the initiation of NEC, or
whether bacterial invasion occurs secondarily following the
breakdown of the epithelial barrier is not known. The presence
of pneumatosis intestinalis, air within the intestinal wall,
however, indicates that bacterial fermentation at least accom￾panies disease. Thus far, however, a single bacterial species or
virus has not been consistently isolated in cases of NEC
(26 –29). Enterobacteriaceae sp. are the most commonly de￾scribed bacteria to be found in association with NEC (30 – 45).
Clostridia sp. and Staphylococcus sp. have also been isolated
from infants with NEC (37,46 –57). Although bacteria are
clearly the most commonly associated microbe with disease,
isolation of viruses and fungus have been described (58 – 64)
(Table 1). The data in Table 1 were derived from a PUBMED￾based search of the English literature for NEC-associated
pathogens using a modified Cochrane Collaboration data￾quality scoring system. Due to the overall low quality of the
data, however, a formal meta-analysis was not possible. The
data are, however, consistent with the notion that NEC is
unlikely to be a primary infectious or toxin-mediated disease.
Although outbreaks of NEC have been described in associa￾tion with feeding formula contaminated by Enterobacter saka￾zakii and breast milk containing Staphylococcus sp., it appears
more likely that a dominant bacterial species gains access to
the submucosa and circulation secondary to breakdown of the
gut epithelial barrier, thereby playing a secondary but requisite
role in disease.
Bacteria and their products have also been implicated in
inflammatory bowel disease in humans (65) and in rodent
models of inflammatory colitis and NEC (66 –70). Detection
and responses to microbial flora in the intestine occur through
interactions with various pattern recognition receptors known
as toll-like receptors (TLR) (71,72). These receptors recognize
specific conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMP), including glycoproteins, lipoproteins, glycolipids,
peptidoglycans, fatty acids, and nucleic acids (73,74). Differ￾ent TLR family members have been identified and are ex￾pressed in a variety of cell types including macrophages,
dendritic cells, and enterocytes (73,75,76) (Table 2). TLR
expression varies with postnatal maturation and cell type,
indeed TLR deficiency has been demonstrated in macrophages
and in the lung of neonatal mice (77). Differences in the
expression of TLR may therefore alter a host’s response to a
commensal or pathogenic microorganism. For example, LPS
is an outer membrane virulence factor associated with Gram￾Table 1. Microorganisms reported in confirmed cases of NEC

negative bacteria and the ligand for TLR-4. In vitro studies
have demonstrated that LPS may facilitate bacterial transcy￾tosis in Caco-2 cells (78) and increase bacterial translocation
(79). Although TLR ligands are expressed by several patho￾genic species, commensal microbes also express these ligands.
In fact, commensal signaling through TLR appear important
for normal intestinal maturation and epithelial homeostasis
(80). Hence, intestinal epithelial expression patterns of TLR-4
in the presence of altered intestinal flora may result in a
variety of local responses, including altered bacterial translo￾cation, gut homeostasis, and induction of cytokine pathways
(71,81). Indeed, the administration of LPS to mice replicates
the findings of human NEC (82,83). In mouse models of
colitis and NEC, TLR-4 knockout mice have reduced inflam￾matory infiltrates when compared with wild-type mice (84).
Thus, signaling via TLR by both enterocytes and cells of the
innate and adaptive immune system may play a crucial role in
triggering the inflammatory sequence in NEC.
BREAST MILK FEEDING AND PROBIOTICS IN
PROTECTION FROM NEC
The microbial ligands recognized by TLR are not specific to
pathogens, and signaling through TLR by commensal micro￾bial flora in the gut may in fact enable normal assembly and
function of the intestinal immune system (85,86). The intes￾tine is devoid of bacterial flora at birth but is rapidly colonized
by the recto-vaginal flora of the mother (55). Colonization by
commensal bacteria is required for the normal development
and maturation of the newborn intestine. Bacterial-host cross-talk
modulates gut vascular development and promotes epithelial
barrier function (87). For example, the intestinal flora stimulates
the production of IgA in animal models (88). Indeed, the pres￾ence of IgA correlates with a decrease in bacterial translocation in
the gut. In fact, the presence of Bacteroides fragilis in vaginally
born infants, when compared with infants born by cesarean
section, correlates with higher levels of IgA and IgM secreting
plasma cells in peripheral blood (89).
The sequence of intestinal bacterial colonization after birth
may provide protection from overgrowth by potential patho￾gens. The earliest bacterial species to colonize the intestine are
facultative anaerobes including Enterobacteriaceae sp. and
Lactobacilli sp., followed by anaerobic bacteria such as Bi￾fidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp., Clostridium sp., and Eu￾bacterium sp. (90). Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria sp. pre￾dominate by approximately 10-d post partum in the full-term
breast milk–fed infant, whereas the microbial flora in the
formula-fed infant is more heterogeneous, with only 50% of
the level of Bifidobacteria sp. found in breast milk–fed in￾fants. Significant differences in the microbial flora are seen in
prematurely born infants hospitalized in the NICU, when
compared with term infants in a non-NICU setting. Several
factors contribute to the abnormal flora found in NICU infants,
including the microbes endemic to a particular NICU and the
frequent use of antibiotics. The intestine of hospitalized pre￾mature infants is likely to be colonized by pathogenic bacteria
such as Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Clostridium sp.,
with a marked paucity of Bifidobacteria sp. (91). Even in
breast milk–fed very low birth weight infants it takes several
weeks to approach the levels of Bifidobacteria sp. found in a
full-term breast-fed infant (92,93). Premature infants fed hu￾man breast milk do, however, have a reduced incidence of
NEC, when compared with formula-fed infants (94). A pro￾spective multicenter study of preterm infants found an almost
10-fold increase in the incidence of NEC in formula-fed
infants as compared with those who were fed breast milk (95).
The positive effects of breast milk feeding may be due to a
variety of antimicrobial products present in breast milk, in￾cluding immunoglobulins, cytokines, oligosaccharides, lacto￾ferrin, and glycoproteins with antiadhesive capacity for bac￾teria (96). In addition, the high levels of prebiotics,
particularly in colostrums, such as fructo-oligosaccharides,
may promote colonization of breast milk–fed infants with
Bifidobacteria sp. thereby abrogating colonization by other
pathogenic organisms (97). Moreover, lactoferrin is a milk
protein found in high concentration in colostrum, which has
been shown to decrease bacterial translocation from the gut
and improve survival in LPS-fed animal models (98). Breast
milk also contains cellular factors that likely facilitate the
development and maturation of the immune system. For ex￾ample, colostrum contains concentrated leukocytes, including
macrophages (55– 60%), neutrophils (30 – 40%), and lympho￾cytes (5–10%) (99). These cells are believed to be active and
viable, and have been isolated from the feces of infants fed
human breast milk.
The identification of probiotic bacterial species involved in
gut homeostasis has stimulated interest in their use in the
prevention and treatment of a variety of intestinal diseases.
Although their mechanisms of action are poorly understood, it
is believed that probiotic bacteria may impair growth of
pathogenic species by stimulating production of nonfunctional
receptor “decoys” in the mucosal lining, by promoting patho￾gen binding without internalization by epithelial cells, or the
activation of an anti-inflammatory cascade (Fig. 1). Nonpatho￾genic enteric microbes may exact an immunosuppressive ef￾fect on epithelial cells through TLR interactions (100). The
potential therapeutic benefit of probiotics has led to interest in
their role in the prevention of NEC. Lactobacillus and Bi￾fidobacteria sp. produce acidic end products during cellular
metabolism, thereby lowering the pH of the intestinal micro￾environment creating a locally unfavorable environment for
pathogens. In mice, Lactobacillus sp. associate with Peyer’s

patches and exert effects on T-helper cells (101). Furthermore,
it has been shown that Lactobacillus sp. binds to mucins and
intestinal epithelial cells, and may be able to reverse the
permeability of the immature gut (102). Additionally, it is
hypothesized that Lactobacillus sp. may stimulate cytokine
secretion and pathogen aggregation. In adults the administra￾tion of probiotic bacteria reduced the mucosal expression of
several key pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1,
IFN-, and IL-8, suggesting that probiotics inhibit the produc￾tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (103) and in turn reduce
epithelial cell apoptosis and the loss of epithelial barrier
function. In addition, other studies demonstrate that Lactoba￾cillus sp. increase the expression of intestinal mucins, which
may directly enhance mucosal barrier function (104). Several
randomized prospective studies in human infants suggest that
oral probiotics decreased the incidence of NEC, without the
development of other infectious complications such as sepsis
(105–107). However, isolated case reports of sepsis following
Lactobacillus sp. feeding have been described in both pediat￾ric and adult populations following probiotic therapy
(108,109). Hence, until further studies of efficacy and safety
are available, routine use of probiotic therapy in premature
newborns cannot be recommended (Fig. 1).
SUMMARY
Necrotizing enterocolitis accounts for significant morbidity
and mortality in the premature newborn. The sequence of
events leading to the development of NEC is complex and still
incompletely defined. Well-developed models of disease and
clinical studies will be required to understand why the prema￾ture newborn is susceptible to NEC. Our consensus supports
that proposed by others: damage to the immature intestine
after birth results in invasion of the intestine by bacteria.
Bacteria, in turn, initiate a cascade of inflammation that leads
to further destruction, or perforation of the intestine and to
systemic infection. This may lead to the infant’s death or to
long-term morbidity in survivors that includes significant
alterations in growth and development. Despite published
reports over the last 30 years implicating many different
microbial pathogens in the pathogenesis of NEC, no individ￾ual bacteria, fungus, or virus has been definitively shown to be
causative of NEC. Although no single organism fulfills
Koch’s postulate, the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of
NEC, similar to other inflammatory bowel diseases, is crucial.
Probiotic therapy is an area of great potential, providing
several strategies to improve epithelial barrier function per￾haps through TLR signaling, precocious maturation of the
mucosal immune system, or simple exclusion of pathogens
from critical niches in the intestine. As our understanding of
the microbial-immunologic underpinnings of NEC continue to
progress, we believe that successful modalities in the preven￾tion and treatment of NEC will emerge.

with an altered bacterial flora in premature infants may stimulate the produc￾tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines further compromising intestinal defense
mechanisms. The resulting imbalance between epithelial cell injury and repair
leads to a vicious cycle of bacterial invasion, immune activation, uncontrolled
inflammation, and gut barrier failure.
