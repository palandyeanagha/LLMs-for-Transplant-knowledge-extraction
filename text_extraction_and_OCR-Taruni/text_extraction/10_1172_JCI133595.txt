BACKGROUND. Preclinical experiments have shown that donor blood cells, modified in vitro by an alkylating agent (modified 
immune cells [MICs]), induced long-term specific immunosuppression against the allogeneic donor.
METHODS. In this phase I trial, patients received either 1.5 × 106
 MICs per kg BW on day –2 (n = 3, group A), or 1.5 × 108
 MICs 
per kg BW on day –2 (n = 3, group B) or day –7 (n = 4, group C) before living donor kidney transplantation in addition to post￾transplantation immunosuppression. The primary outcome measure was the frequency of adverse events (AEs) until day 30 
(study phase) with follow-up out to day 360.
RESULTS. MIC infusions were extremely well tolerated. During the study phase, 10 treated patients experienced a total 
of 69 AEs that were unlikely to be related or not related to MIC infusion. No donor-specific human leukocyte antigen 
Abs or rejection episodes were noted, even though the patients received up to 1.3 × 1010 donor mononuclear cells before 
transplantation. Group C patients with low immunosuppression during follow-up showed no in vitro reactivity against 
stimulatory donor blood cells on day 360, whereas reactivity against third-party cells was still preserved. Frequencies of 
CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi transitional B lymphocytes (Bregs) increased from a median of 6% before MIC infusion to 20% on day 180, 
which was 19- and 68-fold higher, respectively, than in 2 independent cohorts of transplanted controls. The majority of Bregs 
produced the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. MIC-treated patients showed the Immune Tolerance Network operational 
tolerance signature.
CONCLUSION. MIC administration was safe and could be a future tool for the targeted induction of tolerogenic Bregs.

transplant recipients. From August 2015 to February 2017, four￾teen donor (D) and recipient (R) pairs were screened for inclusion 
in the TOL-1 study (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental mate￾rial available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/
JCI133595DS1). Baseline characteristics of patients are shown in 
Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1. The MIC product was ultimately 
administered intravenously to 10 patients (R1–R7, R11, R12, R14) on 
the day of donor leukapheresis and product preparation as a 1-time 
administration. Patients received a prescribed dose of either 1.5 × 
106 MICs per kg BW on day –2 (n = 3, group A) or 1.5 × 108
 MICs per 
kg BW on day –2 (n = 3, group B) or day –7 (n = 4, group C) before 
living donor kidney transplantation, in addition to post-transplan￾tation immunosuppression with cyclosporine A (CyA), enteric￾coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS), and methylpredniso￾lone. The TOL-1 study design is depicted in Figure 1.
Data collected during the first 30 days after transplantation 
showed that MIC infusions were extremely well tolerated. A total 
of 69 adverse events (AEs) including 3 serious AEs (SAEs) occurred 
in the 10 treated patients (Table 2 and Supplemental Tables 2 and 
3). AEs were either unlikely to be related (n = 1) or not related 
(n = 68) to MIC therapy. During the study phase, no positive cross￾match results, de novo donor-specific HLA Abs (DSAs), or rejection 
episodes occurred, and all patients had stable kidney graft function 
with a serum creatinine level below 2 mg/dL on day 30 after sur￾gery (Table 2, Supplemental Table 4, and Supplemental Figure 2).
No donor chimerism was detectable after MIC infusion. One day 
after MIC infusion, no donor chimerism was detectable in the 10 
patients (Supplemental Table 5). An absence of donor chimerism 
was further confirmed on day –1 before and on days 7 and 30 after 
transplantation. As expected from chimerism analyses, none of 
the patients showed clinical evidence of graft-versus-host disease 
during follow-up.
Clinical outcomes up to 1 year after transplantation. After the 
study endpoint on day 30, patients were followed to day 360 after 
kidney transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapy in patients in 
group C was reduced by lowering the doses of CyA and EC-MPS 
and stopping corticosteroids (Supplemental Figure 3). During fol￾low-up, no de novo DSAs or rejection episodes were noted, and all 
patients had stable kidney graft function (Table 3, Supplemental 
Table 4, and Supplemental Figure 2). On day 360 after surgery, the 
median serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dL (range, 1.1–2.1 mg/dL), 
the median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58 
mL/min/1.73 m2
 (range, 37–75 mL/min/1.73 m2
), and the median 
urinary protein excretion was 10 g/moL creatinine (range, 2–19 g/
moL). No opportunistic infections were noted. In particular, no BK 
virus (BKV) replication was observed during rigorous post-trans￾plantation screening. A total of 10 nonopportunistic infectious 
episodes occurred in 4 of the 10 patients (Table 3). No post-trans￾plantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM), leukopenia, episodes 
of diarrhea, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease 
(PTLD), or other malignancies were observed. The total antihy￾pertensive therapeutic intensity score (TIS) was lower on day 360 
after transplantation than before surgery, particularly for patients 
in group C, and normal BP was maintained in all patients.
On the basis of previous experimental studies, we expected 
that treatment with the highest MIC cell numbers 7 days before 
transplantation would induce the strongest donor-specific immu￾Introduction
Long-term renal allograft survival is limited for 2 reasons: first, 
conventional immunosuppression is not capable of preventing 
chronic rejection, which is responsible for more than half of graft 
losses; and second, conventional immunosuppressive therapy has 
serious side effects leading to increased morbidity and even death 
for patients with functioning allografts (1, 2). Thus, there is a great 
need for an antirejection therapy with fewer side effects and great￾er efficacy. The ideal therapy would involve donor-specific immu￾nosuppression in the absence of systemic downregulation of the 
immune response.
Cellular therapies are gaining increasing attention as an alter￾native to conventional drug therapy for the control of allograft 
rejection (3). Effective rejection prophylaxis in the absence of 
immunosuppressive drugs has been achieved by establishing 
durable hematopoietic chimerism through combined or sequen￾tial hematopoietic stem cell application in kidney transplantation 
(4–7). The administration of hematopoietic stem cells, however, 
is an intervention that is limited by the toxicity of the condition￾ing regimen, the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease, and the 
need for a HLA-well-matched donor. Mixed chimerism is pre￾ferred to full donor chimerism as a means of inducing transplant 
tolerance because it offers greater safety (8). However, mixed 
donor chimerism has often been temporary, thus limiting its effi￾cacy, but still associated with the risk of graft-versus-host disease 
(8). More recently, regulatory cell populations such as regulatory 
T lymphocytes (Tregs) have been evaluated for the prevention of 
kidney transplant rejection in preclinical models and are currently 
being tested in clinical trials (9).
We have developed a cell therapeutic involving modified 
immune cells (MICs) that, when injected into the recipient before 
transplantation, were capable of inducing donor-specific immu￾nosuppression in various animal models such as rat heart and 
hind limb transplantation or pig kidney transplantation (10, 11). 
MICs were also effective in reversing a severe refractory rejection 
episode after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
during emergency treatment in a pediatric patient (10).
In previous studies, we focused on the phenotypic and func￾tional characterization of MICs. When monocytes were treated 
with the alkylating agent mitomycin C and then matured to DCs, 
the resulting cells showed the morphology and phenotype of ear￾ly immature DCs and strongly suppressed the T cell response. 
FACS analysis revealed low expression of stimulatory molecules 
such as CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA class II histocompatibility 
antigen γ chain (HLA-DR) (12). When injected into the prospec￾tive experimental graft recipient, donor-derived MICs preferen￾tially accumulated in peripheral lymphoid organs and induced 
regulatory lymphocytes (10).
Our aim was to translate the findings from preclinical 
experiments to a clinical phase I study in living donor kidney 
transplantation.

intact general immune response (Figure 2A). This was confirmed 
by allogeneic stimulation with third-party cells (Figure 2B). In con￾trast, the T cell response against the respective specific donor was 
absent on day 360 compared with what was observed before MIC 
infusion (Figure 2B). Five of 6 transplanted controls who were not 
treated with MICs showed normal T lymphocyte reactivity to cells 
derived from their respective donors (Figure 2C), even though 
these patients were still on triple immunosuppressive therapy.

were on low immunosuppression.

the donor on day 90 (Figure 2G). This was at the time of steroid 
withdrawal and 2 weeks before some deterioration of kidney graft 
function was observed. The kidney graft biopsy, however, showed 
no abnormality (Supplemental Table 4), and responsiveness to 
the original donor disappeared further in the clinical course, 
without additional treatment. Of note, from day 270 after trans￾plantation onward, all patients showed a completely suppressed T 
lymphocyte response to the donor, with normal reactivity against 
third-party cells.
HLA Abs and Ab titers against bacterial and viral immunizations. 
During follow-up, no de novo DSAs were detected (Table 3). This 
finding raised the question of whether the memory B cell response 
to donor-unrelated antigens as induced by previous immuniza￾tions was also affected. Ab titers against measles (median, 4400 
mIU/mL; range, 200–11,000 mIU/mL), mumps (median, 400;

Figure 2, D–G, shows the response of individual patients 
before (days –7, –6, and –1) and after transplantation (days 7, 30, 
60, 90, 135, 180, 270, and 360). Pretransplantation data include 
values before (day –7) and after MIC therapy (days –6 and –1). The 
measurement in patient R7 showed reduced responsiveness to the 
donor, with preserved responsiveness to third-party cells 1 day 
after MIC administration. This effect was maintained throughout 
follow-up (Figure 2D). In contrast, in patient R11, high prolifera￾tion in response to the donor was found 6 days after MIC therapy 
during an upper respiratory tract infection, and on day 180 after 
urinary tract infection (UTI) with severe allergic reaction to a 
quinolone antibiotic (Figure 2E). A similar reaction was found in 
patient R12 on day 180 after pneumonia and UTI (Figure 2F). In 
both patients, R11 and R12, the antidonor response disappeared 
completely during further follow-up, with a preserved responsive￾ness to third-party cells. Patient R14 had an increased response to 
Figure 1. TOL-1 study design. On day –2 (groups A and B) or –7 (group C) before kidney transplantation, PBMCs were collected from donors by unstimu￾lated standard leukapheresis. PBMCs were transferred to the good manufacturing practice (GMP) facility and incubated with the proliferation inhibitor 
mitomycin C. After washing out of mitomycin C and quality control, the final product (MICs) was administered to patients on the same day, approximately 
12 hours after donor leukapheresis. In the intensive care unit, patients were intravenously administered either 1.5 × 106
 MICs per kg BW on day –2 (n = 3, 
group A) or 1.5 × 108
 MICs per kg BW on day –2 (n = 3, group B) or day –7 (n = 4, group C) before living donor kidney transplantation. After transplantation, 
patients received immunosuppressive therapy with CyA, EC-MPS, and corticosteroids according to the center’s protocol. The primary outcome measure 
was the frequency of AEs on day 30 (end of study).

Strongly increased regulatory B lymphocyte frequencies. Interest￾ingly, the percentage of CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi transitional B lym￾phocytes (regulatory B lymphocytes [Bregs]) was low until day 30 
after transplantation, with a median of 2% (range, 0%–6%) (Fig￾ure 4B) but showed a striking increase thereafter. Breg percentag￾es increased to a median of 20% (range, 5%–40%) on day 180, far 
exceeding the pretransplantation levels, which showed a median 
of only 6% (range, 0%–11%) before MIC infusion. Increases were 
detected not only in the relative proportion but also the absolute 
Breg numbers, from a median of 4.5/μL (range, 0.3–15/μL) on day 
30 to 10/μL (range, 3.8–15/μL) on day 180 (data not shown).
Breg percentages for group C patients in comparison with 
Breg percentages for transplanted controls without MIC infusion 
are shown in Figure 4C. Before MIC infusion, the values were 
comparable between patients in group C and transplanted con￾trols, with a median of 6% and 11%, respectively. In contrast, Breg 
percentages in MIC-treated patients dramatically increased after 
transplantation and were 4, 3, 9, 19, 26, and 13 times higher than in 
transplanted controls on days 60, 90, 135, 180, 270, and 360 after 
transplantation, respectively. Patient R11, who was treated with 
high-dose methylprednisolone because of an allergic reaction to 
a quinolone antibiotic, had a lower percentage (5%) of Bregs on 
day 180. Even this percentage was 5 times higher than that seen in

and tetanus (median, 1.5 IU/mL; range, 0.5–2.1 IU/mL) were low￾est on day 30 after transplantation but reached pretransplantation 
levels during further follow-up (Supplemental Figure 4).
Numbers of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and NK cells. The 
numbers of CD4+

 T lymphocytes as well as activated 
CD4+
 and CD8+
 T lymphocytes remained stable before and after 
transplantation (Supplemental Figure 5, A–D). CD19+
 B lympho￾cytes were highest on day 30 after surgery, with a median of 300/
μL (range, 149–561/μL), but returned to pretransplantation levels 
on day 180, with a median of 35/μL (range, 25–247/μL) (Supple￾mental Figure 5E). CD16+
CD56+
 NK cells behaved inversely, as 
they were lowest on day 30 after transplantation, with a median 
of 60/μL (range, 33–73/μL) but increased to a median of 104/μL 
(range, 93–154/μL) on day 180 (Supplemental Figure 5F).
Unchanged Treg frequencies. The percentage of CD4+
CD25+
FoxP3+
CD127–
 Tregs was low on day 30 after transplantation (Fig￾ure 3) during the period of potent immunosuppressive therapy. 
The median percentage increased from 1% (range, 0%–1%) on 
day 30 to 3% (range, 1%–5%) on day 180 (Figure 3C). This value 
was comparable to the pretransplantation and pretreatment level 
of 3% (range, 2%–4%).

In this patient, Bregs increased subsequently to reach 13% on day

To further exclude a decisive effect of steroids on the observed

and were 24 times higher than in transplanted controls who did not 
receive steroid treatment. The percentage of Bregs was also high￾er than the 2% Bregs detected in a control patient with operational 
tolerance from our center (Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure 6).
It was of particular interest whether Bregs also increased in 
patients in group A (receiving a reduced cell dose on day –2) and 
group B (receiving the full cell dose on day –2). For this purpose, 
we analyzed frozen samples of Bregs from patients in groups A, 
B, and C. As expected from preclinical experiments, patients in 
group C showed the highest Breg percentages, exceeding the val￾ues for the patients in groups A and B by a factor of 68 and 20, 
respectively, on day 180 after transplantation (Figure 4E).
As shown in Figure 4F, the majority of Bregs from patients 
in group C produced the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 
(median, 44%–100%).
High levels of immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β1. 
Supplemental Tables 6 and 7 list 20 serum proteins with the largest 
decreases or increases in all 10 patients after (day –1) as compared 
with before (day –2 or –7) MIC administration. The most intriguing 
findings were the strong decrease in HLA class II histocompatibil￾ity antigen and the increases in IL-10 and TGF-β1 (Supplemental 
Tables 6 and 7 and Figure 5).
The same analysis on day 180 after transplantation compared 
with before MIC administration is shown in Supplemental Tables 
8 and 9. The most important finding was that high levels of the 
immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β1 were main￾tained, reaching a median of 1.1 pg/mL (range, 0.0–1.8 pg/mL) 
and 9107 pg/mL (range, 7602–19,237 pg/mL), respectively (Sup￾plemental Figure 7).

against their respective kidney donors, whereas reactivity against 
third-party cells was retained. These patients also showed strong 
Breg induction with concomitant IL-10 production as well as evi￾dence of an immune tolerance signature according to the defi￾nition of the Immune Tolerance Network. Taken together with 
the results obtained in our previous experimental studies, these 
data support the idea that donor-specific immunosuppression is 
induced by MIC treatment (10–12).
It is interesting that common infections, like upper respiratory 
tract infection or UTI, triggered a transient donor-specific respon￾siveness that disappeared again after resolution of the infection. 
From day 270 onward to the most recent post-transplantation 
follow-up (median, 810 days; range, 720–1080 days), all patients 
showed continued complete suppression of T lymphocyte respons￾es to the specific donor’s cells (data not shown).
An exciting observation in the MIC-treated patients in group 
C was the strong increase in CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi transitional B 
lymphocytes (Bregs) after transplantation. Transitional CD19+
 B 
cells, characterized by surface expression of CD24hiCD38hi, have 
been proposed to be tolerance markers, given the data supporting 
their role in maintaining long-term allograft acceptance (13–18). 
Preserved levels of CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi transitional B lympho￾cytes were described in operationally tolerant patients in a range of 
4%–7% (14). Tebbe et al. found that in patients who received rou￾tine doses of the immunosuppressive agent CyA as a calcineurin 
inhibitor, the frequencies of CD19+
CD24hiCD38hi transitional B 
ed. Of the downregulated functions, suppression of immunologi￾cal disease/hypersensitive reaction was of special interest in the 
context of transplantation (Figure 5).
Patients display an Immune Tolerance Network operational tol￾erance signature after MIC infusion. Since IL-10–producing Bregs 
were associated with operational tolerance, the Immune Toler￾ance Network operational tolerance signature was assessed for 
patients in group C and compared with that of patients in groups 
A and B, who lacked the remarkable increase in Breg frequencies. 
Although some overlap with the other groups was observed, the 
strongest expression of IGKV4-1 and IGKV1D-13 on day 180 was 
found in group C patients (Supplemental Figure 8).
Discussion
The primary objective of this phase I clinical trial was to establish 
nontoxicity. MIC infusions were extremely well tolerated, with no 
infusion-related side effects. None of the 10 patients developed de 
novo DSAs or had rejection episodes, even though they received up to 
1.3 × 1010 allogeneic donor mononuclear cells before transplantation.
Since some of the results went beyond a classical safety 
study, we were encouraged to examine these data with regard to 
a possible efficacy of MIC therapy. Naturally, definitive conclu￾sions cannot be drawn at this time. Group C patients received the 
highest cell dose 7 days before surgery and were on low immuno￾suppression therapy during follow-up. They showed an absence 
of post-transplant cellular stimulation reactivity when tested

of immunosuppressive medication were derived from our current 
studies in a murine model of lupus nephritis. MIC-treated animals 
showed significantly higher Breg (CD19+
CD5+
CD1dhi) frequencies 
than did untreated controls in the absence of any immunosuppres￾sive therapy (our unpublished observations).
Studies on CD34+
 stem cell transplantation reported donor￾specific unresponsiveness when persistent chimerism was estab￾lished (23, 24). In HLA-identical living donor kidney transplant 
recipients, complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy 
was feasible without allograft rejection, even when chimerism was 
lost further along in the course of treatment (25). We learned from 
our preclinical studies that long-lasting chimerism was not estab￾lished after MIC treatment. After infusion, MICs immediately left 
the circulation and preferentially accumulated in the spleens of 
treated rats, where the cells were detectable for a maximum of 7 
days (our unpublished observations). Impressively, when PBMCs 
from MIC-treated animals were later transferred into naive rats, 
those rats tolerated heart allografts from the original MIC donor 
strain but not from a third party (10). This indicates the induction 
of regulatory cell populations in treated animals during the short 
contact of the recipient’s immune system with donor MICs. In line 
with these observations, MIC-treated group C patients established 
no donor chimerism at a 1% detection limit of the assay, where￾as Bregs were detectable at high percentages throughout the 
follow-up period.
A limitation of this study is the absence of surveillance biopsies 
beyond day 7 after transplantation to rule out alloimmune injury 
such as subclinical T cell–mediated inflammation. CyA was cho￾sen rather than tacrolimus, because it represented the standard 
calcineurin inhibitor for unsensitized kidney recipients in our cen￾ter at the time of the study, and since no interference of CyA with 
MIC treatment was found during preclinical experiments (26). We 
speculate that tacrolimus would provide similar results. In favor 
of this assumption are the results of a recent study showing that 
the Breg levels in stable immunosuppressed patients on tacroli￾mus were even higher than the levels in patients on CyA (17). We 
lymphocytes were in the range of 0%–5% during the first year after 
transplantation. Those patients who showed frequencies greater 
than 1% experienced no rejection episodes (17). In our study, the 
Breg frequencies in transplanted controls who were not subjected 
to MIC conditioning were comparable to those described by Tebbe 
et al., whereas the MIC-treated patients in group C had Breg fre￾quencies in the range of 5%–40% (median, 20%) on post-trans￾plantation day 180, far exceeding the frequencies detected in the 
transplanted controls (day 180 median, 1%) and in these group C 
patients before transplantation (day –7 median, 6%).
Bregs modulate the effector function of both adaptive and 
innate immune cells (19). The suppressive function of Bregs is 
thought to be mediated in part by IL-10 (20). We found that the 
great majority of Bregs in the MIC-treated group C patients pro￾duced IL-10. This finding was further substantiated by the obser￾vation that IL-10 levels in the sera of these patients were increased.
Recent data suggest that the type and dose of immunosup￾pressive therapy may interfere with the induction of CD19+
CD24hi
CD38hi transitional B lymphocytes (Bregs) (21, 22). In a cross￾sectional study of 117 transplant recipients, Bottomley et al. found 
no significant association between steroids and Bregs (21), whereas 
in the Genetic Analysis of Molecular Biomarkers of Immunological 
Tolerance (GAMBIT) study, Rebollo-Mesa et al. observed slightly 
higher Breg percentages in patients with reduced or no steroids (22). 
To address this issue, we identified transplanted control patients 
on immunosuppressive therapy comparable to that for MIC-treat￾ed patients and analyzed their Breg frequencies retrospectively. 
Impressively, on day 135 after transplantation and before steroids 
were stopped in 3 of 4 group C patients, we found that Breg percent￾ages were already 9-fold higher than those in the transplanted con￾trols. At last follow-up, more than 1.5 years after steroid withdrawal 
in all MIC-treated group C patients, Breg frequencies were 24-fold 
higher than in a second independent cohort of transplanted controls 
without steroid treatment, and considerably higher than the Breg 
percentages in a control patient with operational tolerance from 
our center. Data that also argue against an overriding interference

donor, allergy to the investigational drug or components of it, and other 
diseases that, in the opinion of the investigator, prohibited participation 
in the study or participation in another interventional study.
From August 2015 to February 2017, 14 donor and recipient pairs 
were screened for inclusion in the TOL-1 study (Supplemental Figure 
1). A total of 12 donors underwent leukapheresis. The MIC product 
was given intravenously to 10 patients (R1–R7, R11, R12, and R14) on 
the day of donor leukapheresis and product preparation as a one-time 
administration. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: 
patient R8 was found to have a dissection of the right iliac and femoral 
artery during the pre-transplant CT scan evaluation. The evaluation 
had already been performed before screening, but dissection became 
obvious only after screening. In patient R9, acute hyperthyroidism 
was diagnosed during the second visit. Transplantation surgery had 
to be postponed in both patients. During screening, patient R10 was 
found to have a positive IgM XM-ONE crossmatch (Olerup) result, 
and patient R13 was found to have irregular warm-reacting Abs at 
the second visit. Though these were not formal contraindications for 
inclusion in the study, we decided not to perform cell therapy in either 
patient for safety reasons. Transplantation surgery was performed as 
scheduled but outside the TOL-1 study. Two donors (D8 and D10) 
were screened but received no leukapheresis for cell harvesting, since 
the corresponding recipients were excluded from the study. Leuka￾pheresis was performed in donor D9 and D13, but cells were not fur￾ther processed and were discarded for the reasons outlined above. For 
these donors, the study was finished according to the protocol with 
visit 3, on the day after leukapheresis.
Patients were treated sequentially in a stepwise approach with 
dose escalation from group A (1.5 × 106 MIC per kg BW) to group B 
(1.5 × 108
 MICs per kg BW) to account for suspected possible AEs relat￾ed to the MIC product such as embolism, inflammation, allergy, or an 
AE due to mitomycin C or the buffer (Figure 1). Since a too-low MIC 
number was considered to carry a risk of recipient sensitization (recip￾ients in group A received only 1% of the number of MICs compared 
with patients in groups B and C), MICs were administered only 2 days 
before transplantation during the dose escalation phase. From group B 
to group C, the administration time point was changed from day –2 to 
day –7 before transplantation. Based on preclinical experiments, day 
–7 was considered the optimal time of administration.
Donor visit number 3 (end of study) was on the day after leuka￾pheresis (day –1 in D1–D6 and day –6 in D7, D11, D12, and D14). During 
recipient visit number 3 on day –1 before transplantation surgery, 
recipient sensitization by the MIC product was excluded by CDC and 
ELISA crossmatching and HLA Ab screening using the Luminex tech￾nique (One Lambda). Transplant recipient post-transplantation visits 
took place on day 7 ± 1 (visit 4, including a protocol biopsy procedure) 
and day 30 ± 4 (visit 5, end of study).
Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy and post-transplan￾tation care were performed according to center practices, with CyA, 
EC-MPS, and methylprednisolone administered starting on the day of 
surgery. Detailed information on the immunosuppressive therapy for 
patients is provided in Supplemental Figure 3. Ab induction therapy 
with an IL-2 receptor antagonist was not performed in MIC-treated 
patients, since IL-2 receptor signaling is believed to be critical for the 
development and expansion of regulatory cells (27).
Follow-up period and transplanted controls. After the study end￾point on day 30, patients were followed out to day 360 after kidney 
recognize the limitations of the data obtained in a phase I clinical 
trial and particularly in this trial, in which only 4 patients received 
the full MIC dose on day –7. Clearly, the observations described 
in this report are preliminary. Nevertheless, their exciting nature 
motivated us to submit the results at this time, because we believe 
they will stimulate immune tolerance research that builds on these 
preliminary observations.
In summary, MIC therapy was well tolerated in this phase I 
clinical trial and did not lead to humoral sensitization or rejec￾tions. The in vitro findings of an absence of specific cell-stimula￾tory reactivity against donor cells after transplantation, paralleled 
by a rise in Breg numbers and IL-10 levels, led us to hypothesize 
that MIC conditioning may constitute a promising method for 
inducing donor-specific immunosuppression in renal transplan￾tation. Although our findings are promising, it is much too early 
to know whether this treatment is sufficiently tolerogenic to allow 
complete withdrawal of immunosuppression. We believe, howev￾er, that the preliminary phase I results are sufficiently encouraging 
to proceed with phase II and III clinical trials.
Methods
Study protocol. We performed a 30-day, single-arm, single-center phase 
I clinical trial to determine the safety and feasibility of intravenous 
administration of donor-derived MICs for individualized immunosup￾pression in living donor kidney transplant recipients (TOL-1 study).
The primary outcome measure was the safety and feasibility of 
intravenous administration of MICs as measured by the frequency of 
AEs in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (i.e., GFR <30 
mL/min/1.73 m2
), who received a kidney transplant from a living donor. 
AEs were recorded according to Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAEs), version 4.03. Secondary outcome measures 
included the incidence of infection, CMV reactivation, PTLD, delayed 
graft function (DGF), a positive complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) T-, B-, unseparated-cell crossmatch and/or ELISA crossmatch 
result, development of DSAs, biopsy-proven cellular or Ab-mediated 
rejection, stable graft function, and graft and patient survival out to 
day 30 after transplantation. In addition, a predefined scientific pro￾gram was implemented to investigate the possible efficacy of the ther￾apy, including FACS analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations, Tregs, and 
Bregs, determination of serum cytokine levels, mixed lymphocyte reac￾tion, and proteome and gene expression analyses. Patients were eligi￾ble for participation in the study if they had stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney 
disease in preparation for a first kidney transplant from a living donor 
aged 18 years or older. Only recipients of an ABO-compatible transplant 
with a CDC panel–reactive Ab (PRA) of less than 20%, no DSAs, and a 
negative CDC and ELISA crossmatch result with their respective donor 
on triple-drug immunosuppressive therapy with CyA, EC-MPS, and 
methylprednisolone were included. Female patients with child-bearing 
potential were on adequate contraception. All patients provided written 
informed consent. The main exclusion criteria were as follows: a psychi￾atric disorder, heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] III or 
IV), severe liver disease, active hepatitis B or C or HIV infection, active 
bacterial, fungal, or viral disease, malignancy or malignancy in the 5 
years prior to the screening, preexisting immunosuppression, vaccina￾tion with a live vaccine in the 3 months before screening, s/p splenecto￾my, substance abuse, pregnancy or lactation, female patients with possi￾ble HLA sensitization due to a pregnancy by or a child with the intended

transplantation, with regular outpatient visits according to the cen￾ter’s practices. Routine screening was performed for BKV (on every 
outpatient visit throughout year 1) and DSAs (days 7, 30, 180, and 360 
and additional screening for TOL-1 patients on days 60, 90, 135, and 
270). During follow-up, biomaterials were collected and analyzed 
retrospectively. Immunosuppressive therapy for patients in group C 
was reduced to lower CyA and EC-MPS doses with or without corti￾costeroids during follow-up beyond day 30 to avoid infectious com￾plications of combined cell-based and immunosuppressive therapy 
(Supplemental Figure 3).
Details on the transplanted controls are provided in the Supple￾mental Methods.
MIC product manufacturing, quality control, and potency assay. 
Details regarding MIC product manufacturing, quality control, and 
the potency assay are given in the Supplemental Methods and Supple￾mental Tables 10–12.
Further investigations. Immunological testing, quantitative chi￾merism analysis in peripheral blood, proteomics analysis of patients’ 
serum samples, and gene expression analysis of peripheral blood were 
performed as described in detail in the Supplemental Methods.
Statistics. Because of the small number of patients and the explor￾atory approach of the trial, only descriptive statistical methods were 
applied. In the text and tables, continuous data are summarized as the 
median and the range and categorical data as absolute and relative 
frequencies. Longitudinal data are displayed over time, stratified by 
group. In figures, the results are presented as individual measurements 
(and the median) or the median and interquartile range. The methods 
of analysis of proteome and gene expression data are described in the 
Supplemental Methods.
Study approval. The TOL-1 study was reviewed and approved by 
the ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, 
Germany, and the Paul-Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany (eth￾ics number: AFmo-549/2014; Paul-Ehrlich Institute, Vorlagen-Nr. 
2252/01; EudraCT number: 2014-002086-30; Clinicaltrials.gov 
identifier: NCT02560220). The study was performed in compliance 
with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from par￾ticipants before inclusion in the study. Biomaterials were collected and 
analyzed according to protocols approved by the ethics committee of 
the University of Heidelberg (ethics numbers: 082/2005, 083/2005, 
S-395/2011, and S-225/2014).
