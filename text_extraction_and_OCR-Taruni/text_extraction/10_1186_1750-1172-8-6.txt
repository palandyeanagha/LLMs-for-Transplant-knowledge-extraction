Abstract
Background: Propionic acidemia is an inherited disorder caused by deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Although
it is one of the most frequent organic acidurias, information on the outcome of affected individuals is still limited.
Study design/methods: Clinical and outcome data of 55 patients with propionic acidemia from 16 European
metabolic centers were evaluated retrospectively. 35 patients were diagnosed by selective metabolic screening while
20 patients were identified by newborn screening. Endocrine parameters and bone age were evaluated. In addition, IQ
testing was performed and the patients’ and their families’ quality of life was assessed.
Results: The vast majority of patients (>85%) presented with metabolic decompensation in the neonatal period.
Asymptomatic individuals were the exception. About three quarters of the study population was mentally retarded,
median IQ was 55. Apart from neurologic symptoms, complications comprised hematologic abnormalities, cardiac
diseases, feeding problems and impaired growth. Most patients considered their quality of life high. However,
according to the parents’ point of view psychic problems were four times more common in propionic acidemia
patients than in healthy controls.
Conclusion: Our data show that the outcome of propionic acidemia is still unfavourable, in spite of improved clinical
management. Many patients develop long-term complications affecting different organ systems. Impairment of
neurocognitive development is of special concern. Nevertheless, self-assessment of quality of life of the patients and
their parents yielded rather positive results.

Background
Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare autosomal recessively
inherited inborn error of propionate metabolism. The bio￾chemical defect involves the conversion of propionyl￾coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) to methylmalonyl-coenzyme
A (methylmalonyl-CoA) by the mitochondrial enzyme
propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC, EC 6.4.1.3). Thus,
the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, odd￾numbered fatty acids, cholesterol side chains, thymine and
uracil is impaired.
Most patients with this disorder present in the neonatal
period with severe metabolic acidosis and hyperammone￾mia. However, late presentations with predominantly
neurological symptoms as well as asymptomatic individuals
have also been described [1-3]. With progression of the dis￾ease, patients are prone to complications affecting the
neurologic, cardiologic, hematologic, immunologic and
gastrointestinal system. As underlined in the proceedings

of a recently held consensus conference on PA, the under￾standing of the disease course in PA is rather limited, with
most information deriving from case reports and small
retrospective case series [4]. Although few authors have
reported data on larger groups of patients [2,5-9] informa￾tion on the long-term outcome of affected individuals is
still limited. This has prompted us to approach a compre￾hensive collection of outcome data on 55 PA patients from
16 metabolic centers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
While the two preceeding reports [10,11] focussed on the
question whether PA should be a target disease of neonatal
screening and on investigations on gene and enzyme levels
we now describe the clinical course of the disease and out￾come of the patients in the study cohort. Apart from clin￾ical information including IQ testing, assessment of growth
data and endocrinological analyses, here we also address
the quality of life of the patients and their families.
Patients, materials and methods
Patients
We investigated 55 living patients with PA from 16
metabolic centers in Germany (12 centers), Austria (3
centers) and Switzerland (1 center). All 55 patients were
examined at their respective metabolic center between
September 2007 and March 2008. Due to a subproject
assessing possible benefits of neonatal screening for PA,
which has been described separately [10], only living
patients younger than 20 years were included in this
study. The 55 patients derived from 50 families and
included 10 sibpairs. Median age at time of investigation
was 5.2 years (range 5 days to 18.6 years). Details of the
study cohort are displayed in Table 1.
The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of
the University of Freiburg and local ethics boards, if this
was considered appropriate by the local physicians.
Written informed consent was obtained from the
patients and/or their parents.
Data collection
We collected retrospective clinical information by review
of medical records. To standardize data collection a
questionnaire was designed which was usually filled in
by two of the authors during visits at the participating
metabolic centers. The questionnaire focussed on the
mode of diagnosis, number of hospital admissions, the
physical and psychomotor development, long-term com￾plications and long-term treatment regimens.
Clinical and laboratory investigations
Clinical examinations were performed during a routine
outpatient visit at the respective metabolic clinic in the ma￾jority of patients (52/55 patients), while 3 children were
investigated during a hospital stay. Within routine blood
sampling, serum was obtained for the assessment of
endocrine parameters. In prepubertal children those para￾meters comprised insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and
thyreotropin. In pubertal and postpubertal patients deter￾minations of sexual hormones (estradiol, testosterone, fol￾licle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) were
added. To evaluate growth and physical development
growth data were collected retrospectively. Bone age was
assessed using hand and wrist X-rays (bone age according
to Greulich and Pyle [12]) and the near final height was
calculated according to the tables by Bayley and Pinneau
[13]. For patients of Turkish, Afghan, Lebanese, Italian,
Iraqi, Algerian, Syrian and Greek origin, growth charts for
Turkish children were applied.
Assessment of neurocognitive outcome and quality of life
In patients older than 2.5 years of age psychological test￾ing was performed. We used two different standard
tests, the Snijders-Oomen Test (SON 2 ½-7, [14]) for
patients aged 2.5 to 8.5 years and the Culture-Free-Test
(CFT 20-R, [15]) for patients older than 8.5 years.
To assess the quality of life of the patients and their
families, 3 standardized questionnaires were applied:
The “Kid-Kindl” questionnaire [16,17], evaluating the
health-dependent quality of life, was filled in by or to￾gether with the patients themselves, whereas the
“Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire” [18] and the
“Familien-Belastungs-Fragebogen” (= Families’ Burden
Scale; [19]) were completed by the patients’ parents. The

“Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire” specifically
addresses the patients’ emotional and behavioural pro￾blems while the latter one targets the families’ daily so￾cial, financial and familial burdens.
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0
and 17.0 software (IBM, Chicago, Il., USA).
Results
This study provides data on 55 patients with PA. Details on
family history and perinatal histories are given in Table 1.
Diagnosis and clinical manifestation
Age at diagnosis ranged between 1 day and 8 years of life
(median 7 days). Out of 55 patients, 35 were diagnosed by
selective metabolic screening (prompted by clinical or la￾boratory abnormalities or by positive family history),
whereas 20 patients were identified by newborn screening.
Only 4 patients (7%) have remained without acute symp￾toms so far (age 6 months to 6.5 years). About three quar￾ters of patients (73%) already became symptomatic within
the first 5 days of life. Only 3 patients presented beyond day
90. The median age at onset was day 4 of life. Details on the
clinical and laboratory findings during the initial acute de￾compensation have been reported previously in the context
of newborn screening [10].
Clinical course, metabolic crises, hospitalizations
The frequency of metabolic decompensations, defined as
episodes of a severely reduced clinical condition or impaired
consciousness which could be associated with acidosis and/
or hyperammonemia, was highest within the first year of life
(median 2 decompensations, range 0–8) and decreased with
increasing age. 11 patients had ≥ 15 metabolic crises. 46/55
patients (84%) required intensive care treatment at least
once due to metabolic decompensation and 32/55 patients
(58%) required intensive care treatment more than twice. In
8 patients (15%) dialysis was performed due to hyperammo￾nemia. Carglumic acid has not been used in any of the
patients with hyperammonemic crisis.
The most common triggers of metabolic decompensa￾tion were common infections, predominantly upper re￾spiratory tract infections or gastroenteritis. A high
protein intake as an isolated trigger of metabolic crises
was reported in only 3 patients.
Physical development
Hand and wrist X-rays were available from 28 patients. In
half of the patients bone age was retarded. Median differ￾ence between bone age and chronological age was −0.5
month (range −37 months to +21 months). In 8 patients
(29%) bone age was accelerated, whereas in 6 patients
(21%) bone age was identical with chronological age.
To assess the patients’ physical development, growth
parameters from the medical records were evaluated at dif￾ferent ages. At birth, median height SDS was +0.66
(n = 48). However, from the age of 3 months to 10 years
patients tended to be smaller (height SDS −0.21 to −1.19 at
different ages) compared to population standards. At the
time of examination, median height SDS was −0.49, median
genetic target height (calculated from parental heights) was
0.48 SDS. The majority of patients (91%) had a height SDS
within the normal range (height SDS −2.0 to 2.0) whereas
only 6% of patients were small with a height SDS below
−2.0. There was no significant correlation between the
number of metabolic crises and growth at the age of 12
months and 3 years, respectively. Most patients did not
reach their genetic target height or genetic height potential
at a young age. This is reflected by a zero correlation be￾tween the SDS of the actual body height and the genetic
target height as well as the SDS of the near-final height and
the genetic target height of the patients. Thus, patients
showed an early onset and progressive growth retardation.
The median body weight at birth was 0.01 SDS. There
was a tendency toward decreased body weight within
the first three months of life (median −0.92 SDS at age
three months), but nearly normal values were found for
the age of 1 to 10 years (median −0.64 - 0.51 SDS, range
−3.86 SDS to 3.78 SDS). The body mass index (BMI) of
the patients was low (−0.63 SDS to −0.17 SDS) within
the first year of life, but tended to be higher in compari￾son with population standards from the age of 1 year
(1.0 SDS-1.5 SDS). The BMI at age 3 months and 2 years
did not correlate with the daily protein intake of the
patients (Kendall Tau = 0.005; p = 0.875 and Kendall
Tau = 0.8 * 10-5; p = 0.861, respectively).
The median head circumference at birth was −0.79
SDS and tended to be low throughout the first three
years of life with median SDS values between −0.31
and −0.9 (range −5.1 SDS to +2.1 SDS).
Endocrinological aspects
Median IGF-1 level (n = 44) was lower than in age- and
gender-matched controls (−1.3 SDS, range −3.63 to 1.12
SDS), but did not correlate with the patients’ height. In
contrast, median IGFBP3 level (n = 42) was slightly
higher compared to population standards (+0.5 SDS,
range −1.9 to 2.25). 4/50 patients (8%) had elevated thyr￾eotropine levels, but there was no case of severe
hypothyroidism. Sexual hormones were analyzed in 11
pubertal and postpubertal patients. They yielded normal
results in 10 patients and hypergonadotropic normogo￾nadism in one 15-year-old boy.
Psychomotor and cognitive development
The majority of patients showed at least a mild impair￾ment of psychomotor and cognitive development. 44%
Grünert et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:6 Page 3 of 9
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/6

of patients who had reached kindergarten age (≥3 years,
n = 45) attended a kindergarten for children with special
needs. At school age (≥ 6 years), 70% of the patients
(21/30) needed special education. Only 5 children
attended a regular school and among them, one patient
even attended a school aiming at qualification for uni￾versity studies. The remaining 4 children had not yet
been enrolled in school.
An overview on the cognitive development and IQ
data is given in Figure 1.
Median IQ was 55. The oldest patient with a normal IQ
was 15.5 years old. Data on the cognitive development/IQ
have previously been reported by Grünert et al. [10].
Complications and outcome
Common abnormalities in our study cohort were motor
retardation (55%), retardation in speech development
(55%) and muscular hypotonia (51%). Less common
neurologic symptoms comprised impaired hearing ability
(13%), ataxia (9%) and visual impairment (7%). After
completion of data collection, one patient developed bi￾lateral optic atrophy at the age of 9.5 years. At age 11
years, she still could follow movements with her right
eye and differentiate light and dark with both eyes.
Brain imaging results [magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and computed tomography (CT)] were available
of 26 patients: 11 MRI and CT scans yielded unremark￾able results, whereas in 15 patients, pathologic findings
were present. The most common findings (5/26, 19%)
were changes in the basal ganglia [10].
As PA is a multi-system disease, complications involve
many different organs and organ systems. An overview
on complications identified in our study cohort is given
in Table 2.
Anemia and pancytopenia were not only found during
metabolic decompensations but also while the patients were
metabolically stable. The hematological abnormalities were
usually reversible, but several patients had more than
one episode of anemia/neutropenia. Cardiomyopathy was
reported in 5 patients, including 2 with only a mild reduc￾tion of the ejection fraction. In one patient the cardiomyop￾athy was hypertrophic, none of the patients showed severe
dilatation of the ventricle. In two patients cardiomyopathy
was reversible. In one of those, a 7-year-old girl, cardiomy￾opathy occurred in context of a metabolic decompensation
and lead to cardiorespiratory insufficiency requiring inten￾sive care treatment.
In two patients acute pancreatitis was reported at the age
of 14 and 18 months, respectively. In both children pan￾creatitis was associated with metabolic decompensation. In
the 14-month-old patient laparotomy was performed due
to concomitant ileus and suspected peritonitis. Chronic or
recurrent pancreatitis was not observed in any of the study

participants. Mild osteopenia diagnosed by wrist X-ray was
documented in one 7-year-old patient and was treated by
oral calcium supplementation.
Long-term therapeutic regimens
Diet
Retrospectively obtained nutritional data were rather
heterogeneous. Most patients received a diet restricted
in natural protein to reduce the intake of precursors of
propionyl-CoA. Within the first 5 years of life, median
natural protein intake ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 g/kg body
weight per day. In the majority of patients an amino acid
mixture free of precursors of propionyl-CoA was supple￾mented to meet age-appropriate protein intake recom￾mendations. Amino acid mixtures were administered in
doses ranging from 0.1 to 4.1 g/kg body weight per day
(median intake between 0.7 and 0.9 g/kg body weight
per day at different ages within the first 5 years of life).
Feeding difficulties and percutaneous endogastric tube
feeding
Feeding problems were frequent. In 27/55 (49%) patients
implantation of a percutaneous endogastric tube (PEG)
was necessary. PEG tube feeding was started at a median
age of two years (range from 6 months to 7 years). In most
patients with PEG tube the meals were predominantly
given orally, whereas only 15% of patients were exclusively
tube-fed (nasogastric tube or PEG tube). In 12/55 patients
(22%) aversion to natural protein was observed.
Carnitine
To prevent secondary carnitine deficiency, L-carnitine
was supplemented in most patients (93%, 51/55) with
recorded doses ranging from 31 to 601 mg/kg body
weight/day. In 12/36 patients (33%) a low concentration
of free carnitine was documented at least once during a
hospitalization (for reference values see [20]).
Reduction of gut bacterial flora by oral antibiotics
In 40% of patients antibiotic treatment was performed to
reduce the bacterial gut population, a major source of
propionic acid. In 50% of these patients metronidazole
was given over a period of 2 weeks per month whereas
50% of them received metronidazole and colistin in dif￾ferent intervals and dosing regimens.
Quality of life
Patients older than 8 years (n = 20) were asked to evalu￾ate their quality of life with regard to self-confidence/self
esteem, body perception, emotional stress/emotional
well-being, family life, school, friendships and their atti￾tude towards their disease. A parameter summarizing
different scales was calculated. Seven out of these 20
patients were not able to answer due to cognitive
deficits. Family life was the top-ranked aspect (n = 7/13).
The most distinct variations within our patient cohort
were found in the category of self-confidence/self esteem
and emotional stress/emotional well-being. The majority
of the 13 patients appeared to consider themselves as
healthy and not affected in their daily life reflected by a
median KidKindl total score which did not differ signifi￾cantly from the healthy control group [17].
The results of the Strengths and Difficulties question￾naire as well as corresponding data of healthy controls
are displayed in Table 3. Notably, 29% (14/48) of parents
have the impression that emotional problems, concen￾tration difficulties and pathologic interaction with peers
have a high impact on their child’s quality of life.
The “Familien-Belastungs-Fragebogen” which espe￾cially addresses the families’ daily social, financial and fa￾milial burdens yielded highly variable results among
affected families. Daily and personal burdens were con￾sidered to have the highest negative impact on family
life, while coping with the disorder and the strain on sib￾lings were not considered major problems. There was no
correlation between the patient`s IQ and the strain on
the families from the parents’ point of view.
Discussion
Clinical manifestation
As reflected in our study cohort, the clinical heterogeneity
of PA is broad, ranging from neonatal onset with severe
neurologic symptoms to asymptomatic children. However,
most patients seem to manifest within the neonatal
period. About three quarters of the study participants be￾came symptomatic within the first 5 days of life already.
Late-onset forms were rare. Asymptomatic individuals,
such as the 13-year-old girl described by Wolf et al. [1],
were the exception even among children identified by
newborn screening who received early treatment. Similar
observations have been made by other authors. Sass et al.
[8] reported a prevalence of 86% early manifestations in a
study of 42 PA patients whereas in a French retrospective
study with 17 PA patients 71% were classified as early
onset patients [21]. Of 25 PA patients reported by Lehnert
et al. [6] 92% presented within the neonatal period.
Neurologic outcome
Poor intellectual development is still the rule in PA.
About three quarters of our study patients were mentally
retarded. Median IQ was only 55 and the vast majority
of patients required special education. This is in accord￾ance with earlier case series [8,9]. However, our data
allow a more positive view when compared to outcome
studies of the 1990s [2,7]. Although improved acute and
long-term management have increased the survival rates
within the last decades, the neurologic outcome of PA
patients is still unsatisfactory. As recently shown, the IQ
Grünert et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:6 Page 5 of 9
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/6

is negatively correlated with the number of metabolic
crises, but not simply with patients’ age [10].
Neuroradiologic findings are rather nonspecific in
patients with PA ranging from white matter abnormal￾ities to widening of sulci and fissures, delay in myelin￾ation, brain atrophy and basal ganglia changes [22-24].
In our study, brain imaging yielded pathologic findings
in 42% of patients (11/26) with basal ganglia changes
being the most common abnormality.
Physical development und endocrinologic aspects
Impaired physical development is a common problem in
patients with PA. Sass et al. [8] and van der Meer et al. [21]
have reported a tendency towards decreased body height
in PA patients with a mean height SDS of −1.19 and −2.0,
respectively. In accordance with those studies, height was
also decreased in our patients especially when compared to
patients’ target heights calculated from parental heights.
Our data are indicative of an early onset and progressive
growth retardation in PA patients. In contrast, patients’
BMI were found to be higher compared to population
standards after the first year of life. Failure to thrive has
been postulated to be due to iatrogenic dietary protein re￾striction, frequent infections and metabolic decompensa￾tions [21,25]. However, in our patients growth neither
correlated with patients’ daily protein intake nor with the
number of metabolic decompensations. To further eluci￾date the cause of growth retardation, several endocrinolo￾gic parameters were determined. Secondary deficiency of
IGF-1 can be caused by malnutrition or hypothyroidism
[26]. IGF-1 concentrations were decreased in the majority
of patients, however, significant correlation with the
patients’ body height could not be shown. Touati et al.
[27] also reported low IGF1 concentrations in patients
with PA, but growth curves of those patients were within
normal limits. Severe hypothyroidism was detected in
none of our patients. Abnormal puberty which has been
reported as a problem before [9] was also not found apart
from one case of hypergonadotropic normogonadism.
Complications
The most common complications in our patients were
hematological abnormalities including anemia, neutro￾penia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia, findings that
have been described previously [28,29]. Cardiac complica￾tions, especially cardiomyopathy, may contribute signifi￾cantly to the mortality of PA patients with several fatal
cases reported [30]. More recently, the association between
PA and long-QT syndrome has been described [31]. Jame￾son and Walter [32] reported the first case of a child with
PA and long-QT syndrome suffering a life-threatening
event secondary to long QT syndrome. In our patients,
long-QT syndrome was rather rarely reported (24% of
patients) compared to data from an observational longitu￾dinal study with 10 PA patients published by Baumgartner
et al. [33] who found a prolonged QTc interval (>440 ms)
in 70% of patients beyond infancy. However, ECGs were
only documented for 38/55 patients of our cohort and in
most cases, no exercise and 24h ECGs were performed.
Osteoporosis or osteopenia have only been documen￾ted in one patient. However, as bone density assessment
is usually not done on a regular basis in most patients,
osteoporosis might be underdiagnosed.
The rather high incidence of impaired hearing ability
in our PA population suggests a connection between
both disorders. This is in contrast to an earlier assump￾tion by Brosch et al. [34], who reported four PA patients
with sensoneurinal hearing loss.
Pancreatitis seems to be a rare complication [35,36] and
was documented in two of our patients only. Optic atro￾phy, observed in one of the patients studied here, has been
reported in four patients with PA [37,38] before.
Therapy
There is still controversy about the optimum natural
protein intake of patients with PA and different thera￾peutic regimens are used by different metabolic centers.
The median natural protein intake in our patients ran￾ged from 0.8 to 1.1 g/kg body weight per day within the

first 5 years, well in accordance with the recommenda￾tions given by Sass et al. [8]. Most patients’ diet was sup￾plemented with a precursor-free amino acid mixture.
L-Carnitine was supplemented in 93% of the patients.
The high frequency of feeding disorders in this series of
patients must be stressed and is in agreement with a re￾port by Touati et al. [27]. About half of all patients
received tube-feeding to promote growth and ensure
metabolic stability.
Quality of life
While the neurologic outcome of PA has been addressed
by several case reports and small case series, very little is
known about the quality of life of PA patients. In our study,
there might be an ascertainment bias because the question￾naire could only be filled in by those patients whose cogni￾tive impairment was only moderate. Among all categories,
family life was the top-ranked aspect with regard to the
patients’ quality of life. This may well reflect the significant
role of the parents and the family ties that can arise by
caring for a child that suffers from a chronic, potentially
life-threatening disease. Notably, evaluation of the ques￾tionnaire data suggests, that most patients consider their
quality of life high. Most patients appeared even to per￾ceive themselves as healthy and felt not affected in their
daily life. The results of this self-evaluation resemble very
much the data of a healthy control group [17].
From the parents’ perspective, difficulties in the inter￾action of patients with peers are the most common problem.
Notably, according to their parents’ estimate, abnormal find￾ings are more common in PA patients in all categories
addressed by the questionnaire when compared to healthy
children. This includes emotional issues and conduct pro￾blems. One half of all patients were considered to have psy￾chological problems or to show at least borderline
abnormalities. The percentage of PA patients who – based
on their parents’ view- have psychological problems was
about four times higher compared to healthy controls [39].
Chronic diseases may severely affect family life and pose
psychosocial stress to parents and siblings. The results of
the FaBel-questionnaire revealed higher values for five of
the six subscales for PA patients when compared to the
healthy controls reported by Ravens-Sieberer [19]. Those
scales include daily and social strains, personal strains and
worries about the future, financial burdens and strains on
siblings. These findings underline that apart from the
medical care affected families also need psychological and
social support. Therefore, they strongly advocate for the
inclusion of psychologists and social workers into the
interdisciplinary metabolic team.
Conclusion
Our data on a large cohort of PA patients show that the
outcome is still poor in most cases especially with regard
to the neurocognitive and psychosocial development.
Long-term complications affecting various organ sys￾tems are common.

Competing interests
This study was financially supported by Milupa Metabolics GmbH & Co KG,
Friedrichsdorf, Germany, who also financed the Freiburg Workshop on
Propionic Acidemia (Oct 16–18, 2008). However, the sponsor had no
influence on the planning and conduction of the study and the
interpretation of the results.
Authors’ contributions
SCG participated in planning and conduction of the study and in data
interpretation. She recruited patients and prepared the draft of the
manuscript and the display items together with JOS. SM and LdS visited all
metabolic centers involved in this study, gathered the clinical data by
reviewing all available medical records, performed the IQ tests and collected
the required laboratory samples. They assembled the data, performed the
statistical analyses, prepared one display item, and contributed to the
interpretation of the findings. MB selected and supervised the psychological/
IQ tests and was the statistical advisor of the study. MW organized and
performed laboratory investigations and provided logistic support. KW
participated in the study design and in the evaluation of endocrinologic
data. TM, ML, RE, RS, OAB, MRB, MB-K, DK, CH, IK, TM, JBH, RS, SB, HGK, VK,
SS-B, AvT-H recruited patients for the study, provided clinical data, were
advisors at data collection and contributed to the interpretation of the
findings. TS was in charge of enzymatic diagnostic tests. WS and JPK were
advisors on data evaluation, ASF advised on study design and interpretation.
KOS was the main pediatric endocrinologist of the study. He supervised the
endocrinologic evaluation, assessed bone ages and advised on metabolic
aspects. JOS conceived and coordinated the project, drafted the manuscript
together with SCG and supervised data collection and interpretation. He
serves as guarantor for the article. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.
