Summary:
Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)is a child￾hood leukemia for which allogeneic BMT is the only
curative therapy. At our pediatric stem cell transplanta￾tion unit, we performed 26 BMTs in 23 children (age
0.5–12.7 years). Conditioning was CY/TBI based (1980–
1996, n ¼ 14)or BU/CY/melphalan based (1996–2001,
n ¼ 9). Donors were HLA-identical siblings (n ¼ 11),
unrelated volunteers (n ¼ 9)or mismatched family mem￾bers (n ¼ 3). A total of 10 patients survive in CR (median
follow-up 6.8 years, range 3.1–22.2 years). Relapse or
persistent disease was observed in eight and two patients,
respectively. Nine of these patients died, one achieved a
second remission following acute nonlymphatic leukemia
chemotherapy (duration to date 5.3 years). Transplant￾related mortality occurred in four patients. Overall
survival at 5 and 10 years was 43.5%. Using T-cell￾depleted, one-antigen mismatched unrelated donors was
the only significant adverse factor associated with relapse
in multivariate analysis (P ¼ 0.039, hazard ratio 4.9).
Together with a trend towards less relapse in patients with
graft-versus-host-disease and in patients transplanted with
matched unrelated donors, this suggests a graft-versus￾leukemia effect of allogeneic BMT in JMML.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare
myeloproliferative disorder in young children, formerly
grouped within the FAB classification of myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS).1 It has also been described as juvenile
chronic myeloid leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia.2 In a recently proposed pediatric morphological
classification,3 JMML is separated from the other subtypes
of MDS, that is, RA, RAEB and RAEB-t because of
different characteristics. Molecular biological investiga￾tions have shown three major, mutually exclusive abnor￾malities in JMML patients, that is, the presence of NF1
gene mutation,4 mutations in the Ras-signalling pathway5
and mutations in the PTPN11 region.6,7 Without treat￾ment, the 10-year survival of JMML is 6%;8 and there are
only sporadic definitive responses to chemotherapy.9,10
Allogeneic BMT has been shown to improve outcome:
retrospective evaluations of series including 15 patients or
more reported an overall survival (OS) of 39–58%.2,11–15
Woods10 found a similar OS at 6 years of 31% for 13
patients treated on a prospective study (CCG protocol
2891). The major causes of failure in all series were a high
relapse rate and a high transplant-related mortality (TRM).
This report describes our single center experience over a
20-year period from June 1980 until January 2001 on 23
children undergoing transplantation for JMML.
Patients and methods
Patients
From June 1980 until January 2001, 26 transplants in 23
consecutive children with JMML were undertaken in the
pediatric BMT unit of the Leiden University Medical
Center in Leiden, The Netherlands. Preliminary results of
the first two transplants were described in a conference
report16 and five other patients were included in a registry
report of the European Working Group on Myelodys￾plastic Syndromes (EWOG-MDS)8 (Table 1). The current
group of 23 consecutive patients consisted of eight female
and 15 male subjects (age 6 months–12 years 8 months,
median 4 years 3 months, at the time of transplant).
Diagnosis of JMML was made upon clinical and labora￾tory signs and symptoms. In retrospect, all patients
qualified for the diagnosis of JMML based on fulfilment
of the three major and at least two of the five minor criteria
of the International JMML Working Group.14

Clinical and laboratory characteristics at diagnosis
Characteristics of the patients are given in Table 1.
In all, 22 patients showed hepatosplenomegaly, 10 had
petechiae or hematomas. One of the patients had Noonan
syndrome (UPN 419). Three patients had a clinical
diagnosis of neurofibromatosis (NF; UPN 140, 329 and
355). The median leukocyte count was 36.4  109
/l (range,
3.1–185.0; n ¼ 23), the median platelet count was
29.0  109
/l (range, 6–364; n ¼ 22) and the median HbF
was 15.0% (range, 2.9–41.2; n ¼ 14). The karyotype was
abnormal in nine cases.
Pretransplant therapy
Early on, patients were treated with intensive chemother￾apy before BMT in an attempt to lower the blast cell count
in the peripheral blood. This policy was largely omitted
from 1994 onwards. A total of 11 children thus received
intensive chemotherapy according to the acute nonlym￾phatic leukemia (ANLL) protocols of the Dutch Childhood
Leukemia Study Group (DCLSG), consisting of AraC,
daunorubicine and etoposide (induction), of prednisone, 6-
thioguanine, vincristine, adriamycine, AraC and cyclopho￾sphamide (consolidation) and of HD-AraC and etoposide
(intensification). Nine children received nonintensive treat￾ment, for example, with 6-mercaptopurine or low-dose
Ara-C, while three children did not receive chemotherapy
before transplantation. At the start of the conditioning for
BMT, intensively pretreated patients were not different
from nonpretreated or nonintensively pretreated patients
with regard to age at BMT (split 4 years), hepatomegaly
(yes or no), splenomegaly (yes or no/splenectomized),
percentage bone marrow blasts (split 5%), cytogenetic
abnormalities (yes or no). The leukocyte and monocyte
counts were significantly higher in nonpretreated or
nonintensively pretreated patients than in intensively
pretreated patients. Taken together, we consider the two
groups comparable.
Donor choice
Until 1990, only matched sibling donors (MSD) were used.
Subsequently, unrelated donors (UD) and mismatched
related donors (MMRD) were also considered suitable.
HLA typing was performed by both serological micro￾cytotoxic techniques and DNA techniques (which have
replaced the serological typing for class II in 1992 and for
class I in 1999). HLA-A, B, Cw, DR, DQ and DP loci were
taken into consideration for donor matching. In case of an
unrelated donor, additional tests (MLC and CTLp) were
used in the donor selection procedure. Retrograde high￾Table 1 Patient data at diagnosis, pretransplant treatment and interval to BMT

resolution DNA typing for all loci on UD and MMRD
patient/donor pairs confirmed the previous serological
typings. The patient/donor characteristics are given in
Table 2. A total of 11 patients received an allogeneic BMT
from an MSD, nine patients from a UD (matched n ¼ 4;
one-antigen mismatched n ¼ 5: class I mismatch n ¼ 3, class
II mismatch n ¼ 2). The remaining three patients received
bone marrow from a MMRD (phenotypically identical
aunt (n ¼ 1), 11/12 identical sister (n ¼ 2)).
Conditioning regimens
The conditioning regimens (Table 2) varied with time.
From 1980 until December 1996, the scheme was CY/TBI
based (according to the national regimen for ANLL
conditioning) except for three children below the age of
2 years at transplant, who received BU instead of TBI.
The BU, CY and melphalan (Mel) regimen, used from
December 1996 onwards, was proposed by Locatelli
et al.
17 Three patients received the CY/TBI-based regimen
in this period because of pre-existent hepatic dysfunction.
TBI was given as a single fraction of 7–7.5 Gy to patients
younger than 10 years, and in two fractions of 6 Gy each on
two consecutive days to children aged X10 years. CY
60 mg/kg was administered intravenously once daily for 2
days with uromitexan prophylaxis. BU 1 mg/kg was
administered orally four times daily for 4 days. MeI
140 mg/m2 was given intravenously once. Ara-C 1 g/m2
was administered intravenously twice daily for 2 days.
Etoposide 300 mg/m2 was administered intravenously once
daily for 3 days. In those children with a mismatched,
unrelated donor, Campath-1G (0.2 mg/kg/day for 5 days,
starting at day 7) and anti-LFA-1 (AntilfaR, 0.2 mg/kg/
day for 12 days after 0.4 mg/kg the first day, ie at day 2)
were additionally administered, whereas in the case of a
matched unrelated donor only Campath-1G was added to
the regimen.
Marrow manipulation and infusion
In the five cases of one-antigen mismatched unrelated
donors, T-cell depletion (TCD; Table 2) of the marrow was
performed by an immunorosetting technique resulting in a
mean depletion of 2.5 log (range, 2.2–3.0).
18 Red cell
depletion was undertaken for ABO incompatibility in
seven donor/recipient combinations. Bone marrow was
infused either 36 h after the last infusion of CY or 24 h
after infusion of Mel or at a minimum of 6 h after TBI.
The median total nucleated cell dose in the harvest (in case
of TCD, number before depletion) was 3.2  108
/kg
recipient weight (range 0.86–11.0  108
/kg). Quantitation
of CD34 þ cells in the graft was done in nine recent
transplantations only (median number 4.4  106
/kg, range
2.2–10.8  106
/kg).
Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis and
treatment (Table 2)
CyA plus short-course MTX were used for 17 BMTs for
prophylaxis of GvHD. CyA alone was used once and MTX
long course alone for 4 BMTs. In one case, only Campath￾1G and anti-LFA-1 were given. CyA starting at day 1 was
given intravenously (2 mg/kg/day) until oral medication
(6 mg/kg/day) was tolerated with dose adjustment accord￾ing to the results of regular blood sampling. In general,
this was continued for 6 months and tapered thereafter
until discontinuation at 9 months. MTX prophylaxis
consisted of 10 mg/m2 once daily intravenously on day

þ 1, 3, 6 and 11. Long course MTX, that is, continuation
of 10 mg/m2 once weekly until day 102 was given without
CyA addition.
Acute and chronic GvHD were graded according to the
Seattle criteria.19,20 Acute GvHD4grade 1 was treated with
methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day i.v., followed by tapering
of the dose according to clinical response.
Supportive treatment
All patients received the same supportive care. They were
nursed in strict protective isolation using sterilized food and
beverages and received total gastrointestinal decontamina￾tion using nonreabsorbable antimicrobials.21 Microbiolo￾gical control of the suppression of the potentially
pathogenic microflora was carried out in samples of the
throat and stool once or twice weekly.21 No systemic
antimicrobial prophylaxis was given, except for Pneumo￾cystis pneumonia prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole from day
þ 20 onwards.
Statistical analysis
Event-free survival (EFS) and OS were calculated by the
Kaplan–Meier method and the difference was tested with
the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was
employed to assess the independent effects of risk factors
on OS, where the selection of variables was stepwise. All
calculations were performed using SPSSs (version 10.0.7,
Chicago, USA).
Results
Transplant outcome (Table 3)
Engraftment, defined as a sustained count of
leukocytes41.0  109
/l (Table 3), occurred in 20/23
cases (at a median of 24 days, range 14–47;
neutrophils40.5  109
/l at a median of 30 days, range
18–55; platelets450  109
/l at a median of 36 days, range
23–78). Acute GvHD was seen in five cases; two of
these developed extensive chronic GvHD. Nine patients
are in continuous complete remission (CCR) with full
donor chimerism, two showed recipient cells emerging at
þ 2 and þ 4 weeks, with JMML morphology (persisting
disease), eight relapsed and four died of transplant-related
causes (3/4 with viral infection or reactivation). The median
follow-up of the nine patients in CCR is 6.0 years (range
3.1–22.2 years) after BMT. The probability of relapse-free
survival of the total cohort is 48712% (Figure 1). In one
patient who relapsed after BMT with a T-cell-depleted UD,
relapse was diagnosed 3.3 years after BMT. Intensive
ANLL treatment resulted in a second remission of
presently 5.3 years duration and full donor chimerism. In
the seven other relapsed patients relapse occurred between
1 and 11 months after BMT. All nine patients with
persisting disease or relapse in the first year after BMT
died. Three of them died after a second BMT using
different conditioning regimens and the same original
donor; one patient additionally received leukocyte-acti￾vated killer cells.

Factors associated with relapse
To assess the factors possibly predictive for relapse, the 10
children with progressive disease/relapse were compared to
the 13 children without relapse. Karyotype (abnormal vs
normal), treatment before BMT (intensive ANLL treat￾ment vs none/nonintensive treatment), interval from
diagnosis to BMT (split 6 months), age at BMT (split 4
years), percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow at the
start of conditioning, conditioning regimen (CY/TBI vs
BU/CY/Mel), donor type (MSD, UD, MMRD), graft
manipulation (TCD vs no TCD) and occurrence of acute
and/or chronic GvHD (yes or no; number of evaluable
patients 22 and 20, respectively) were analyzed with (time
to) relapse as event. Univariate analysis of the data showed
a significant negative influence on EFS of intensive
treatment before BMT (P ¼ 0.04, Figure 2) and of using
one-Ag mismatched T-cell-depleted UD marrow
(P ¼ 0.004, Figure 3). No significance was reached for the
other variables tested, mainly due to limited power because
of small patient numbers. Multivariate analysis showed a
significant unfavorable effect of using one-Ag mismatched
T-cell-depleted UD marrows corrected for the effect of TBI
by keeping TBI in the multivariate model (estimated hazard
ratio 4.946; 95% CI: 1.1–22.6). Of the nine UD cases (five
TCD and four non-TCD), persisting disease (n ¼ 2) and
relapse (n ¼ 2) were only seen in recipients of a TCD graft.
There was a positive tendency for nonintensive/no pre￾BMT therapy in the Cox’s model when corrected for the
effect of TBI (estimated hazard ratio 0.264, P ¼ 0.108).
Discussion
Although the only curative approach for JMML is to
perform an allogeneic BMT,2,11–13 this procedure is
accompanied by a high relapse rate and a high TRM,
resulting in an OS of 31–58% as reported in the recent
literature.8,10,11,14,15 In our series, OS is 43.5710% at 5 and
10 years; the probability of relapse-free survival (TRM
censured) is 48712%. Rapid sustained engraftment in 20
of 22 evaluable children proved that engraftment was not a
problem, similar to results in other studies.14,15,17,22
Factors possibly predicting a relapse, as found by us and
by others, relate to karyotype,14 intensive pre-BMT
chemotherapy, conditioning regimen,11,22 donor type,11
TCD and GvHD.15 Manabe et al14 found in a multivariate
analysis on the outcome of 27 JMML patients an abnormal
karyotype to be the only significant risk factor for
decreased OS.14 In our series, statistical significance was
not reached due to limited power, but a trend towards
worse outcome having an abnormal karyotype was noted.
This observation needs to be confirmed with larger
numbers. Intensive chemotherapy given before the start
of the conditioning for BMT had a significant adverse effect
(P ¼ 0.04 in univariate analysis) in our study on the relapse

rate after BMT. This finding is not in agreement with the
findings of other authors11,14,22 and needs further study.
The influence of TBI in the conditioning regimen for
JMML was studied by Matthes-Martin et al22 in a single
center evaluation of 11 transplants and a review of the
literature on single center reports. The relapse rate was
significantly higher in patients conditioned with a TBI￾containing regimen. In other series,14,15 the outcome was
comparable for both types of conditioning. Locatelli et al11
found better EFS of 62% with the non-TBI regimen vs 11%
with the TBI regimen for children with JMML given a
BMT from an identical sibling or one-antigen-disparate
relative. In our series, there is a trend towards a negative
influence on EFS of the TBI-containing regimen. These
combined data support the inferiority of the TBI regimen,
but further study is needed to validate this finding. With
regard to donor type, Locatelli et al11 found EFS for all
UD transplants of 22% vs EFS of 38% for all transplants
with identical sibling or one-antigen mismatched family
donors (Po0.05). Our results with transplants from fully
matched unrelated donors (n ¼ 4) are as good as those from
sibling donors, similar to another reported series.14 Smith
et al15 found significantly more relapses in using one-Ag
mismatched unrelated marrows, but from his study this
finding could not be associated with TCD. Using unrelated
marrows, which were T-cell depleted because of one-Ag
HLA disparity between donor and recipient, was the only
factor in both univariate and multivariate analysis with a
significant negative effect on EFS in our study. This
suggests a possible graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect of
allogeneic BMT in this disease. However, the 95% CI is
rather large due to small patient numbers.
Matthes-Martin et al22 found no difference in relapse
rate in patients with or without acute GvHD. In a recent
multicenter overview from the National Marrow Donor
Program of 46 JMML patients transplanted with unrelated
donor marrow, a statistically significant relapse preventing
effect of chronic GvHD was found. In our study, acute
GvHD occurred only in five of our 22 evaluable patients
(22.7%). Of these patients, one relapsed in the chronic
GvHD phase, while of the 15 patients without GvHD,
seven patients relapsed (not statistically significant).
Apart from relapse, another major problem were lethal
viral infections. In recently published series,15,22 infectious
complications also accounted for the largest number of
transplant-related deaths. In the future, it may be possible
to reduce the frequency of this complication by pre-emptive
antiviral therapy following RT-PCR surveillance of viral
nucleic acids in blood samples post-BMT.
Given the trend noted in this study that there may be a
deleterious effect of intensive pretransplant chemotherapy,
in the absence of evidence in the literature suggesting
benefit from such therapy, we recommend to proceed to
transplant once a donor is identified. Our experience and
the literature show no benefit from TBI, therefore, we also
recommend the use of a non-TBI conditioning regimen.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that using one-Ag
mismatched T-cell-depleted unrelated donor marrows is
associated with inferior outcome. Trials to enhance a GvL
effect post BMT should be undertaken in a prospective
multicenter setting.
