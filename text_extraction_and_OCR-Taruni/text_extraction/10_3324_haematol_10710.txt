Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia
(BOOP) are late-onset non-infectious pulmonary complications (LONIPCs) following
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the present study 10 of
197 conventionally prepared stem cell recipients developed BOOP after 365 days and
6 patients developed BO 333 days post-transplant. No BOOP or BO was diagnosed
following T-cell depletion (p<0.05). Chronic GVHD was ascertained in all BOOP
patients and appeared significantly (p<0,001) more frequent in the conventional
transplant group. The data confirm a strong association between T-cell activity, chron￾ic GVHD, BO and BOOP and point out the impact of T lymphocytes in the pathomech￾anism of BOOP.

Brief Report
P
ulmonary complications develop in 30-
60% of allogeneic haematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (SCT) recipients and
are considered as major cause of morbidity
and mortality.
1 The use of prophylactic
antimicrobial agents changed the spectrum of
pulmonary complications from infectious to
noninfectious, in particular late-onset nonin￾fectious pulmonary complications
(LONIPCs).2 LONIPCs occur 3 months after
transplantation in 10-15% of cases and are
life-threatening complications which can sig￾nificantly reduce quality of life.3,4 Although
the classification of LONIPCs is undefined,
the most common categorizations include
bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), bronchiolitis
obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and
interstitial pneumonia (IP) or idiopathic pneu￾monia syndrome (IPS).5
BOOP is less common than BO with an
incidence of 1–1.7% in allogeneic SCT recipi￾ents.5 Among SCT-recipients with histologic
BOOP, 5-year survival was estimated at
33%.6 Acute GVHD affecting the skin and
chronic GVHD involving the gut and oral cav￾ity were found to be the most important risk
factors for the development of BOOP follow￾ing SCT and there is some evidence that
alloreactive T-lymphocytes in the context of
acute and chronic GVHD may play an impor￾tant role.6 Recent reports suggest that muta￾tions of the NOD2 and TLR-4 genes may
influence the risk of severe acute GVHD after
allogeneic SCT.
7 Since NOD2/ CARD15 is
also expressed on bronchial epithelial cells the
question was raised whether NOD2/
CARD15 and TLR-4 variants are also
involved in the development of BO or BOOP.
This retrospective single-center study
aimed to evaluate the impact of in vivo and
in-vitro T-cell depletion or mutations of the
NOD2 and TLR-4 (Thr399Ile) genes on the
post-transplant development of BO and
BOOP. 
Design and Methods
Two-hundred and eighty-one patients
undergoing BMT (n=33) or PBSCT (n=248)
from genotypic HLA-identical (n=242) or
HLA-mismatched (n=39) sibling donors
between January 1998 and December 2003
were consecutively included. Patients were
divided into two treatment groups character￾ized by either conventional transplantation of
PBSC or BM (group 1, n=197) or in vivo T-cell
depletion by administration of anti-CD52-
antibody followed by transplantation of an
unmanipulated graft (n=14), or receiving a
CD34-purified transplant (n=70) (group 2,

n=84). The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophos￾phamide (120 mg/ kg body weight [BW]) in combination
with total body irradiation (TBI) in 4 daily fractions of 2.5
Gy (n=239), or oral busulfan (BU) (1 mg/ kg BW every 6
hours over 4 days) in combination with cyclophos￾phamide (120 mg/ kg BW) (n=23). Treosulfan (Medac,
Hamburg, Germany), 12-14 g/ kg for 3 days was used with
subsequent cyclophosphamide (120 mg/ kg BW) applica￾tion in 19 patients. Inclusion criteria for CD34-PBSCT is as
previously described.8 Patients scheduled for CD34-
PBSCT received a conditioning regimen with fractioned
TBI, cyclophosphamide (120 mg/ kg), and thiotepa (10
mg/ kg BW) with anti-thymocyte globuline (ATG) (ATG￾S, Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) 10 mg/kg of BW for
4 days (n=70). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of a short
course of methotrexate on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 in combi￾nation with continuous intravenous cyclosporine in group
1 patients (n=197). Patients with CD34-PBSCT received
no further GVHD prophylaxis. For in vivo T-cell depletion
alemtuzumab (Campath 1-H, 10 or 20 mg) was adminis￾tered for 5 days followed by continuous intravenous
cyclosporine application. Post-transplant T-cell add-backs
were performed as previously described.8 Patient demo￾graphics and treatment characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. CD34+ cell selection was performed using the
CliniMACS device (Milteny Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany), as previously described.8 Pre-transplantation
histocompatibility testing of recipients and related donors
generally consisted of low- and intermediate-resolution
HLA-A, -B, -C, and high resolution HLA-DRB1 and DQB1
DNA-based typing as previously reported.9 The diagnosis
of BO and BOOP was based on clinical presentation, chest
radiography, computed tomography (CT) or high-resolu￾tion CT (HRCT), pulmonary function tests (PFT) and
pathological findings according to Palmas et al.
3 Patients
were classified as having BO if a decline in the forced expi￾ratory volume of 1 s (FEV1) to less than 80% of the pre￾dicted value and FEV1/ vital capacity (VC) less than 70%
was observed. If lung biopsies could not be obtained for a
definitive histological confirmation of BOOP, the diagno￾sis was assumed by correlating PFT findings (restrictive
defect and normal expiratory flow) with CT and HRCT
findings (peripherally distributed patchy air space consoli￾dation, ground-glass attenuation, nodular opacities) in
conjunction with clinical features after exclusion of an
infectious etiology by bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL).
Acute and chronic GVHD was graded according to stan￾dard criteria.10,11 Single nucleotide polymorphisms 8, 12,
and 13 of the NOD2/CARD15 gene were determined by
a Taqman® protocol as published earlier by Hampe et al.
12
and Holler et al.
13 Genotyping for SNPs of TLR-4 were ana￾lyzed by a LightcyclerTM protocol using hybridization
probes as published earlier by Hamann and co-worker.14
PCR and subsequent melting curve analyses were per￾formed using the Lightcycler device and related software. 
Statistics
Cumulative estimates were calculated with the use of
the Kaplan-Meier method. A proportional hazards Cox
regression model was used to assess the independent
effect of several covariates on the clinical endpoint devel￾opment of BOOP. 
Differences between time-to-event distribution func￾tions were compared by a log-rank test (Mantel-Haenszel).
Differences between the groups concerning disease stage,
relapse, death, acute and chronic GVHD were evaluated
with the use of the Fisher´s exact or χ2 test.

Results and Discussion
The clinical features, demographic profile and transplant
related data of patients are summarized in Table 1. Both
patient groups were observed over the same time period
with a median follow up of 30 months after transplanta￾tion. Patients of group one showed a significantly higher
portion of advanced disease stages and HLA-nonidentical
donors. This correspond to criteria used to assign patients
to treatment groups. Bone marrow was transplanted more
frequently in the conventional transplant group (group 1)
compared to the T-cell depletion group (group 2). Group 1
patients presented a higher incidence of acute as well as
chronic GVHD (p<0.001). Treatment related mortality in
group 1 was 33.7 %±3.5%, significantly higher than the
17.2%±4.2% seen in group 2 (p<0.0025).
Among all hematopoietic stem cell recipients the inci￾dence of BOOP was 3.6 % and of BO 2.1 %. BOOP
occurred a median of 365 days after HSCT, and a BO
median of 330 days post-transplant. Ten of the patients
with a disease-free survival of more than 3 months after
transplantation fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for BOOP
and 6 for BO. The most common symptoms associated
with BO and BOOP were dyspnea, dry cough and fever.
Lung biopsies with consecutive histological verification of
clinically suspected BOOP were obtained in 5 patients. All
cases of BO and BOOP were observed in group 1
(p=0.036). The estimated probability for the development
of BOOP 690 days post-transplant was 8.9%±2.7%, and
for BO 3.3%±1.3%. 
Clinical characteristic of the patients who developed
BOOP or BO after HSCT are shown in Table 2. While the
overall incidence of grades I and II acute GVHD was 46%
for all transplant recipients, 90%-100% of the patients
with BOOP or BO had grade I-II acute GVHD (p<0.01).
Nine of the 10 patients with BOOP were male and all 10
BOOP patients received allografts from female donors.
Although chronic GVHD was more common in BOOP
and BO compared to the overall incidence (70%), differ￾ences did not reach statistical significance. BOOP and BO
resolved or remained stable in 81% of all cases under treat￾ment with bronchodilators, corticosteroids and immuno￾suppression. Two patients. one with BOOP and one with
BO, died of respiratory failure due to pulmonary disease
progression and one BO patient died of severe sepsis. All
but one BOOP patient and all of the BO patients received
peripheral blood stem cells as transplants. 
Among the patients with BOOP and BO, heterozygous
NOD2 mutations occurred with a frequency of 6.3% in
recipients for SNP11 and 6.3% in donors for SNP12 respec￾tively. Calculated haplotype frequencies did not differ
from controls of an earlier reported study.15 This resulted
in an overall percentage of 88% pairs with unmutated
SNPs at the patient and donor side. For TLR-4, only SNP
Thr399Ile was shown to influence GVHD.15 Here no dif￾ferences in the mutation rate were observed for patients
with or without BO or BOOP, neither on patient nor
donor side (data not shown).
Although the pathogenetic mechanisms for the develop￾ment of LONIPCs are unclear there is some evidence that
alloreactive T-cells have an impact since non-infectious
lung complications were observed in the context of donor
lymphocyte infusions.4 Cooke et al. suggested an associa￾tion between lung injury and alloreactive donor lympho￾cytes in a murine model16 while Majeski et al. reported
that respiratory reovirus1/L induction of intraluminal
fibrosis used as an animal model of BOOP is dependent on
T lymphocytes.17 In our present study, BO as well as
BOOP only developed among patients transplanted fol￾lowing conventional myeloablative conditioning com￾bined with standard immunprophylaxis while T-cell
depletion apparently seemed to protect against late pul￾monary complications which corroborates the assumption
of alloreactive donor T-cells to be involved in the inflam￾matory processes of BO and BOOP.2,4,6 Clinical
Improvement of BOOP following extracorporeal photo￾pheresis was reported to implicate some clinical relation￾ship between BOOP and chronic GVHD.18 Although we
could not identify acute or chronic GVHD as independent
risk factors for BO or BOOP in multivariate analysis, acute
as well as chronic GVHD were observed significantly less
frequent in the T-cell depletion group. 
Because of the recently reported association of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the NOD2/CARD15
and TLR-4 gene with increased acute GVHD severity and
TRM,13,15 it was assumed that NOD2/CARD15 or TLR-4
variants may contribute to changes in host immunity, pre￾disposing for BO or BOOP.7 Despite the small number of
cases, our results suggest BO and BOOP to develop inde￾pendently from mutations of the NOD2 and TLR-4
(Thr399Ile) genes.
It is interesting to note that BOOP occurred almost
exclusively in male recipients who received PBSCT from
female donors. All patients except one who developed BO
and BOOP were transplanted with G-CSF mobilized and

peripherally collected stem cells. This might imply that
besides donor gender, the graft composition or graft type
could also be relevant for the induction of late pulmonary
complications. The influence of the graft origin on
immunologic reactions after allogeneic transplantation
was confirmed by the fact that, when compared with
BMT, PBSCT is associated with a significantly increased
risk for high grade acute GVHD and extensive chronic
GVHD.19 In addition to GVHD, conditioning-related toxi￾city as a major contributing factor for BO and BOOP has
also to be taken into consideration.20,21 Although in the
present evaluation there is an apparent imbalance
between the clinical features of the patient groups, T-cell
depletion resulted in significantly less TRM. This was
probably due to both a reduction in applied conditioning￾related toxicity and effective GVHD-prophylaxis. So
diminished acute toxicity in combination with delayed T￾cell immune reconstitution8 might be the cause for the sig￾nificantly decreased occurrence of late noninfectious pul￾monary complications in patients treated with T-cell
depleted transplant procedures. Further clinical and exper￾imental studies are needed to identify risk factors for
LONIPCs and to substantiate T-cell mediated immune
mechanisms in BO and BOOP to improve clinical out￾come after allogeneic SCT.
