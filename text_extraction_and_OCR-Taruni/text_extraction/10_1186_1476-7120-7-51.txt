Abstract
Introduction: Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) has independent prognostic
value in heart failure patients but may be influenced by left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. The
present study assessed the association of TAPSE and clinical factors, global and regional LV function
in 634 patients admitted for symptomatic heart failure.
Methods & Results: TAPSE were correlated with global and regional measures of longitudinal LV
function, segmental wall motion scores and measures of diastolic LV function as measured from
transthoracic echocardiography.
LV ejection fraction, wall motion index scores, atrio-ventricular annular plane systolic excursion of
the mitral annulus were significantly related to TAPSE. Septal and posterior mitral annular plane
systolic excursion (β = 0.56, p < 0.0001 and β = 0.35, p = 0.0002 per mm, respectively) and non￾ischemic etiology of heart failure (β = 1.3, p = 0.002) were independent predictors of TAPSE, R2 =
0.28, p < 0.0001. The prognostic importance of TAPSE was not dependent of heart failure etiology
or any of the other clinical factors analyzed, pinteraction = NS.
Conclusion: TAPSE is reduced with left ventricular dysfunction in heart failure patients, in
particular with reduced septal longitudinal motion. TAPSE is decreased in patients with heart failure
of ischemic etiology. However, the absolute reduction in TAPSE is small and seems to be of minor
importance in the clinical utilization of TAPSE whether applied as a measure of right ventricular
systolic function or as a prognostic factor.
Introduction
Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is an important entity
in heart failure as patients with reduced RV ejection frac￾tion have poorer exercise tolerance and prognosis than
patients with preserved RV function regardless of left ven￾tricular (LV) function and degree of pulmonary hyperten￾sion [1]. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion
(TAPSE) has been proposed as a simple and reproducible
parameter for quantitative assessment of RV ejection frac￾tion [2]. The prognostic importance of TAPSE in the eval￾Published: 4 November 2009

uation of RV function in patients with severe heart failure
has been well-described [3], and the parementer has been
recommended in the most recent joint American Euro￾pean guidelines for echocardiographic quantification of
right ventricular function [4]. Later studies showed the
prognostic information in a mixed heart failure patients as
well [5]
More recent validation studies have confirmed the rela￾tion between RV ejection fraction and TAPSE in various
heart failure populations, although the association is
modest in patients with preserved RV function [6-8]. In
addition, it has been suggested that TAPSE may not be
entirely independent of LV function [9].
The present study investigated the relation of TAPSE and
other echocardiographic and clinical parameters, with
emphasis on measures of regional LV function and clini￾cal characteristics of heart failure patients.
Methods
The present study is a sub-study based on the population
of Danish patients, consecutively screened for participa￾tion in the EchoCardiography and Heart Outcome Study
(ECHOS). The ECHOS trial was a prospective, double￾blind randomized, placebo-controlled multi-centre trial
of a selective agonist of the pre-synaptic DA2 and α2 recep￾tors. The trial was based on a screening population
defined as consecutive patients, ≥ 18 years of age, admit￾ted for symptomatic heart failure corresponding to New
York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV within the last
month, requirering treatment with diuretics. Patients were
not eligible for screening if an acute myocardial infarction
was diagnosed. Screening for the ECHOS trial included a
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed at rest in
the left lateral position according to a predefined protocol
ensuring standardized echocardiographic imaging for the
assessment of LV ejection fraction by wall motion index
(WMI) scoring. In addition to the echocardiographic
imaging, demographic and clinical data were collected.
All patients screened for participation in the trial was
included in the present analysis since no effect on the pri￾mary end-point (overall mortality) in the randomized
study was observed [10]. The ECHOS study complied
with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki II, and
was approved by the regional ethics committee prior to
initiation. All patients provided written informed consent
before screening for the ECHOS trial was preformed.
All centers were encouraged to record additional prede￾fined echocardiographic views and standardized training
of physicians from the participating centers was per￾formed prior to initiation of screening. Imaging were
stored on videotapes and digitized at a core laboratory
(MPEGator, Darim Vision Corp., Pleasanton, CA, USA).
All measurements were performed using electronic cali￾pers on custom-made software following on-screen cali￾bration, and were reported as the average of five
measurements performed by two experienced readers,
D.A. and J.K. The echocardiographic imaging included
three apical views for assessment of LV function by WMI
(hyperkinesis = 3, normokinesis = 2, hypokinesis = 1, aki￾nesis = 0, paradoxical motion = -1) in a 16 segment model
[11], which allowed approximation of the LV ejection
fraction from average WMI by multiplication of 30 [12].
Optional imaging included views for measurements right
ventricular end-diastolic outflow tract dimensions in the
parasternal long axis view and tricuspid regurgitation
velocity measured by continuous wave Doppler in the api￾cal 4-chamber view, which was used for calculation of tri￾Table 1: Clinical demographic characteristics and medical history in the study population and relation to TAPSE in univariable linear

cuspid regurgitation pressure gradient by the modified
Bernoulli equation [13]. TAPSE was measured by M-mode
echocardiography at the junction of the tricuspid valve
and RV free wall in the apical 4 chamber view as previ￾ously illustrated [5]. LV parameters included views for
measurements of LV diameters, systolic function by mitral
valve atrio-ventricular plane systolic excursion at the sep￾tal, lateral, anterior and posterior annulus [14], diastolic
function by mitral valve inflow profile for early (E) and
atrial (A) velocities, the E/A ratio, early inflow decelera￾tion time and atrial size by M-mode in the parasternal
long axis view. The coefficient of variation between inde￾pendent measurements of TAPSE was 10% (duplicate
measurements, n = 20).
Baseline data recorded at screening included known cardi￾ovascular risk factors associated with HF: demographic
data, current tobacco use, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, and co-existing cardiovascular disease includ￾ing arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease. The local
investigator also recorded the presence of Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and chronic
reduced renal function. Presumed heart failure etiology
was reported by the local investigator as ischemic or non￾ischemic (hypertensive, valvular, hypertrophic, idiopathic
cardiomyopathy or other/unknown).
We have previously shown that TAPSE is an independent
predictor of all-cause mortality in the present population
[5]. We sought to determine whether clinical factors or co￾morbidities potentially influencing TAPSE would have an
impact on the prognostic value of TAPSE.
Statistical analysis
Data was presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or
number (%). The relations of parameters to TAPSE were
tested by linear regression analysis for continuous varia￾bles and by t-test for categorical variables. Normal distri￾bution of the continuous values was assessed by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Multivariate linear regression
models including all significant clinical and echocardio￾graphic parameters from the univariate analysis were con￾structed to assess independent predictors of TAPSE.
Survival analysis for the assessment of impact of differ￾ences in the etiology of heart failure on TAPSE was per￾formed by proportional hazard regression analysis as
previously described testing for the interaction of TAPSE
and co-variates [5]. SAS software (Cary, NC) version 9.1
was used for all computations, and a p-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
None of the demographic and anthropomorphic parame￾ters available were related to values of TAPSE, whereas sev￾eral of the clinical parameters were significantly related to
TAPSE, Table 1. These factors included heart failure etiol￾ogy where patients with Ischemic cardiomyopathy were
found to have lower values of TAPSE compared to non￾ischemic etiology (17 ± 5 mm vs.19 ± 5 mm, p = 0.001),
see Table 1. As illustrated in Figure 1 the distribution of
values of TAPSE was normal in HF patients with non￾ischemic etiology, whereas the distribution in patients
with ischemic etiology of heart failure had a less homoge￾neous appearance, although TAPSE were normally distrib￾uted in both groups, pKolmogorov-Smirnov = 0.08 and
pKolmogorov-Smirnov>0.15, respectively.

Echocardiographic predictors of TAPSE were global LVEF,
deceleration time of the early mitral inflow (E), the late
mitral inflow (A) and E/A in univariate analysis, see Table
2. Detailed analysis of the regional longitudinal motion of
the mitral annulus in relation to TAPSE revealed a highly
significant direct correlation, see Table 2 and Figure 2. The
association seemed stronger in the septal compared to the
lateral and in posterior compared to the anterior left ven￾tricular wall, see Figure 2 (top panel). Regional radial
motion, as quantified by wall motion index score, was
also significantly correlated to TAPSE, and the relation
seemed stronger in the basal segments compared to the
apical segments and in the septal and anterior-septal seg￾ments than in the lateral or inferior segments, see Figure 2
(bottom panel). Overall the longitudinal LV motion was
stronger related to TAPSE than was radial motion. No cor￾relation of measures of left or right chamber size or systo￾lic pulmonary pressure were found, see Table 2.
Multivariable analysis showed that septal and posterior
longitudinal motion and HF etiology were independently
related to TAPSE, see Table 3. LVEF was different in the
two groups of etiology of heart failure (35 ± 14 and 41 ±
16% for ischemic and non-ischemic etiology, respectively,
p < 0.0001), but there were no effect of this difference on
the relation of HF etiology and TAPSE, pinteraction = not sig￾nificant (NS).
While the independent prognostic value of TAPSE in the
present population has previously been shown [5], the
factors identified to be associated with TAPSE in the
present study could be potential confounding factors with
regards to the association of TAPSE and mortality. We
therefore repeated the survival analysis including all of
these factors and found no impact of heart failure etiology
on the prognostic significance of TAPSE or any of the
other clinical factors listed in Table 1, pinteraction = NS.
Discussion
TAPSE is a widely recognized, clinically useful and feasible
marker of right ventricular dysfunction, and has been
proven to be a valuable prognostic marker in various car￾diac diseases, including heart failure. The present study
adds that TAPSE may be influenced by left ventricular sep￾tal longitudinal motion in patients with symptomatic
heart failure patients and that TAPSE is affected by the eti￾ology of heart failure. None of identified factors however,
induces significant limitation in the every day use of
TAPSE as a prognostic marker in the assessment of heart
failure patients.
Reduced LVEF seem to have an impact on TAPSE, even in
the setting of preserved right ventricular ejection fraction
[9,15]. The present study adds that longitudinal motion of
the septal and adjacent segments are closer related to
TAPSE than radial motion as assessed by wall motion and
lateral segments, respectively. Furthermore, basal seg￾ments seem stronger correlated to TAPSE than apical seg￾ments. The concept of ventricular interdependence shown
in experimental models could thus be an important
explanatory factor in the relation of TAPSE and LVEF [16].
TAPSE was also found to be correlated to markers of
diastolic dysfunction although none of these parameters
were independent parameters in the multivariable model.
RV end-diastolic diameter and systolic pressure as esti￾mated by tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient were
not related to TAPSE as previously reported [5], while an
earlier study showed a weak correlation of pulmonary
artery pressure and RV function in heart failure patients
[1]. The mean tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient
was 33 mmHg in the present study, and it could be con￾sidered low in a symptomatic heart failure population,
but should be interpreted in the context of being meas￾ured after treatment with diuretics have been initiated.

Pulmonary disease and heart failure share a number of
risk factors and as a result, co-existing pulmonary disease
in heart failure patients is reported in about 25% of
patients [17]. In addition heart failure per se is associated
with both restrictive and obstructive changes in pulmo￾nary function [18,19]. Presence of COPD in the medical
history was not related to TAPSE in the present study, and
earlier studies have shown that RV dysfunction only occur
at advances stages of the disease [20,21].
Several clinical factors were found to be related to
decreased TAPSE although the reduction on average was
in the order of 1 mm, and thus likely to be of limited clin￾ical importance. These factors included a history of
ischemic heart disease, previously diagnosed heart failure
and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and presumed ischemic
origin of heart failure, of which only the latter was found
to be an independent predictor of TAPSE when adjust￾ments for echocardiographic parameters were made.
TAPSE is known to be reduced in patients with atrial fibril￾lation and to normalize after conversion to sinus rhythm
[22], and the present study adds that presence of paroxys￾mal atrial fibrillation is also related to reduced TAPSE.
Previous studies have reported that non-ischemic cardio￾myopathy more frequently affects both ventricles than
heart failure of ischemic origin [23,24]. In one study
TAPSE was actually increased in patients with anterior
myocardial infarction as a compensatory mechanism
[25]. In contrast, TAPSE is reduced in patients with infarct
involving the RV compared to patients with anterior or
inferior myocardial infarction without electrocardio￾graphic evidence of RV involvement [26]. In accordance
we found a heterogeneous distribution of TAPSE in
patients with ischemic etiology, which could suggest a dif￾ferent impact on TAPSE depending on location or extent
of previous infarcts. Unfortunately, data on coronary
anatomy was not available in the present study, but could
be assessed in future studies to further clarify this subject.
No influence of etiology of HF on the prognostic impor￾tance of TAPSE was found, which further consolidates the
use of TAPSE in echocardiographic examination of HF
patients.
TAPSE has previously been found to be independent of
age and gender in healthy individuals [27,28], and the
present study adds that TAPSE is also unrelated to age and
gender patients with heart failure. The lack of relation to
body size also consolidates the routine use of TAPSE with￾out correction for body surface area in these patients.
Tachycardia on the other hands seems to be associated

with reduced values of TAPSE, and interpretation of
TAPSE in presence of tachycardia should be performed
with caution.
Limitations
Heart failure etiology and presence of co-morbidity was
reported by the local investigator, and although pre-spec￾ified definitions for these factors were provided, the accu￾racy of these data may be less than perfect. However, we
find it unlikely that this would induce significant bias in
the present analysis.
Imaging for the centralized echocardiographic analysis
was performed at the local centers. To limit variation, phy￾sicians from all centers received training in the acquisition
of all pre-specified views included the optional imaging of
the measures reported in the presents study. Differences
between patients in whom imaging for analysis of TAPSE
was not available and the present cohort have been previ￾ously described [5], and we find it unlikely to be a signif￾icant source of confounding in the present analysis.
Conclusion
TAPSE is reduced with left ventricular dysfunction in heart
failure patients, in particular with reduced septal longitu￾dinal motion. TAPSE is decreased in patients with heart
failure of ischemic etiology. However, the absolute reduc￾tion in TAPSE is small and seems to be of minor impor￾tance in the clinical utilization of TAPSE whether applied
as a measure of right ventricular systolic function or as a
prognostic factor.
