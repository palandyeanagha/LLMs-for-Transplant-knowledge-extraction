Abstract
Six jaundiced patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis and a dominant biliary stricture
were managed by endoscopic placement of
endoprostheses. Five showed considerable
improvement within weeks of stenting: their
serum bilirubin concentration fell from mean
(range) 266 imolUl (63-681) to 65 [imol/l (10-
280) after one month. One patient required a
liver transplant at five months because of
continued deterioration in hepatic function.
Follow up of 12-49 months in the remaining
five patients shows sustained biochemical
improvement, with repeat cholangiograms
indicating doubling of the minimum calibre of
the extrahepatic bile duct in four patients and
considerable shortening of stricture length in
three. Three patients developed sepsis at the
time of the initial endoprosthesis insertion:
surgical drainage was necessary in one.
Endoscopic methods of improving biliary￾enteric drainage in jaundiced patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis may be prefer￾able to surgical and percutaneous methods,
which may complicate subsequent liver trans￾plantation.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive
and often fatal disease of the liver, characterised
by chronic inflammatory destruction of intra￾hepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and associ￾ated with recurrent episodes of destructive
bacterial cholangitis.'2 Attempts at influencing
the course of this condition using medical
therapy have been disappointing,'.7 although
preliminary results with ursodeoxycholic acid
and methotrexate are promising.89 Similarly,
attempts at changing the progressive nature of

Several investigators have shown improve￾ment in clinical, radiological, and biochemical
parameters after surgical or percutaneous place￾ment of an endoprosthesis'3 14 or balloon
dilatation.'5 16 Some of these procedures have a
significant morbidity and others involve exten￾sive surgery, which may not be desirable in the
long term in these patients as it may jeopardize
the success of future hepatic transplantation. 1718
We describe the clinical course in six severely
symptomatic patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis in whom endoprostheses placed
endoscopically led to an appreciable and sus￾tained improvement in the clinical, biochemical,
and radiological assessment of their disease.
Patients and methods
Between January 1986 and January 1990, 38 new
patients were referred to our unit with confirmed
or suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis. The
extent of disease was determined by endoscopic
retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and liver
biopsy. Six patients (16%) were considered suit￾able for management by endoprosthesis inser￾tion. This decision was based on the presence of
strictures that severely reduced (by 50%) the bile
duct calibre at the hilum or in the extrahepatic
bile ducts, with good intrahepatic filling seen on
ERC together with recent onset of deep jaundice
(within six months). There were three men and
three women, aged 25-54 years. When con￾sidered for endoprosthesis insertion, the mean
serum bilirubin concentration was 266 ,umol/l
(range 63-681). Two of the six patients had
ulcerative colitis and four had established
cirrhosis. All had symptoms of pruritus or
fatigue, two had recurrent bacterial cholangitis
(at least two episodes in the preceding 12
months), and five of the patients had been
referred specifically for consideration of liver
transplantation (Table). No patient received
specific therapy - for example ursodeoxycholic
acid - before or after stenting.
The endoscopic procedures were carried
out with antibiotic prophylaxis; intravenous
amoxycillin (500 mg) and either ceftazidine (2 g)
or gentamicin (80 mg) were given immediately

4 Endoprostheses were placed endoscopically in
1 five of the patients without resort to sphinctero￾6 >, \\ tomy or a combined percutaneous approach. In
2 S ^<\ > one patient a sphincterotomy was necessary to
facilitate passage of the endoprosthesis. Satisfac￾tory drainage was achieved at first insertion in
five patients but the sixth required repositioning
of the stent five days after the first attempt.
Pruritus was completely relieved within seven
days in five patients. Serum bilirubin and alka￾line phosphatase values fell rapidly from mean
(range) values of 266 ,umol/l (63-681) and 1004
iu/l (363-1965) respectively before stenting to 68
[imol/l (30-128) and 600 iu/l (208-1367) after
one week, and in three patients normal values
were attained (Fig 1). One patient underwent
5 transplantation five months after treatment
1 because of clinical hepatic decompensation. The
other five remain well and asymptomatic after a
mean (range) of 25 months (12-49) follow up,
apart from a variceal haemorrhage in one patient.
Follow up ERCs in these five patients show
measurable radiological improvement in four
(Fig 2). The minimum calibre of extrahepatic
4 ducts in these patients has at least doubled (Fig
3) and the length of the dominant extrahepatic
2 stricture has been reduced appreciably in three.

the bilirubin concentration after replacement.

ERCs were carried out with a Pentax duodeno￾scope (SD32H). Cannulation of the common bile
duct was successful at first attempt in all cases.
All six patients had both intrahepatic and extra￾hepatic radiological features of primary scleros￾ing cholangitis. In five there were long strictures
(>1 cm) in the common bile duct, and in two
strictures affected the common hepatic and main
hepatic ducts in addition to the common bile
duct. Five patients also had moderately severe
intrahepatic disease. Dominant strictures were

Discussion
It is likely that in primary sclerosing cholangitis
considerable secondary liver damage occurs as a
result of bile acid stasis and recurrent bacterial
infection that lead to destructive cholangitis and
secondary biliary cirrhosis. Methods of improv￾ing biliary drainage in this condition are aimed at
ameliorating the effects of these pathological
mechanisms. According to one survival model
for this condition,'9 five of our patients had a 12
month survival probability of less than 50% at
the time of referral and warranted consideration
for transplantation. Five improved considerably
after insertion of the endoprosthesis and remain
well 12-49 months later.
Several reports attest to the desirability of
improving biliary drainage in primary sclerosing

superseded by a more aggressive surgical
approach with the establishment of a chole￾dochoenteric anastomosis with or without endo￾prosthesis.202" Cameron et al'322 extended this
approach to include long term bilateral trans￾hepatic Silastic catheters after excision of the
hepatic duct bifurcation and bilateral hepatico￾jejunostomy. The catheters were irrigated ante￾gradely on a daily basis and by this means 26 of

reported improvement in 10 of 15 patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis in whom per￾cutaneous retrograde biliary dilatation was per￾formed through a surgically created jejunal
stoma access route. Krige et al24 modified this
approach by using a transhepatic U tube stent
and reported improvement in six patients. In a
series of 18 patients, Thompson et al'2 found that
surgical drainage improves only patients with
predominant extrahepatic primary sclerosing
cholangitis. A short duration of preceding deep
jaundice, as in the present patients, may also be
important in determining the response to
drainage. '5
Percutaneous methods for hepatostomy drain￾age or dilatation have evolved in an attempt to
avoid extensive biliary surgery. This technique
may involve considerable time and resources,
however, as detailed by Skolkin et al,'6 who
reported that percutaneous balloon cholangio￾plasty of intra- and extrahepatic ducts in 15
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis
required an average of 3-7 sessions and a mean
(range) of 8-9 hours (4-18). In addition, it is
associated with bacteraemia and intrapleural or
intrabiliary haemorrhage in a significant propor￾tion of patients. 141I
Huibregtse and Tytgat2' first described the
management of primary sclerosing cholangitis
strictures by endoscopic stenting after a sphinc￾terotomy and have since described sustained
improvement in 13 of 16 patients treated in this
way.26 Siegal and Guelrud` performed endo￾scopic balloon dilatation for strictures in two
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and
Johnson et al8 performed sphincterotomy in 10,
subsequently dilating eight and stenting three.
In Johnson's series, patients' liver biochemistry
improved and the number of admissions to
hospital for cholangitis was reduced over a two
year follow up period, but one patient developed
peritonitis as a result of sphincterotomy. We
chose to avoid a sphincterotomy whenever feas￾able because of the long term risks of bacterial
colonisation.`9 Three of our patients (50%) had
septic complications, in two attributable to dis￾tension of the gall bladder at cholangiography
with subsequent obstruction to emptying by
the endoprosthesis. This is a complication that
can be difficult to avoid in primary sclerosing
cholangitis because of the extensive strictures
and the relatively high filling pressures required
to obtain a cholangiogram.
To date, there is insufficient experience to
determine how long stents should be left in
place. Some advocate leaving a percutaneous
endoprosthesis in place for 12-16 months'3 21 but
others have reported such poor tolerance that the
mean duration was <6 months.'6 Huibregtse26
removed the endoprosthesis permanently in
eight of 16 patients without detectable deteriora￾tion at follow up. In four of our patients the
endoprostheses have been removed and the
patients remain well with continued improve￾ment in the radiological assessment of disease. In
one other patient the stricture recurred after
removal of the endoprosthesis at four months.
This patient's clinical condition deteriorated
subsequently but the deterioration was reversed
with further endoprosthesis insertion. That
dramatic radiological improvement can be
achieved even with short term stenting (see Fig
2), confirms a previous report of long term
clinical outcome after short term stenting in
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.30
Similar beneficial effects have been reported in
some series in which balloon dilatation was used
alone.'4-"628 In none of these series were the
patients as severely ill as in the present one, and
in our experience balloon dilatation alone does
not lead to long lasting remission in jaundiced
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Frequent follow up with a view to restenting is
important as strictures recur in up to 50% of
patients.'45 An advantage of the endoscopic
method is that lesions can easily be redilated or
restented if necessary without the risks attendant
on repeated surgery or transhepatic puncture.
The possible effect of endoprosthesis drainage
upon disease progression is of some interest. The
radiological extent of extrahepatic disease is
associated with a poorer prognosis in primary
sclerosing cholangitis.3' Reducing bilirubin and
cholestasis, and perhaps prevention of cirrhosis,
should change the natural history of the condi￾tion in individual patients according to the
clinical models currently being proposed.32 33
Thus, according to the Mayo Clinic prognostic
model, stenting improved the risk categories of
our patients from high to moderate risk (two
patients) and moderate to low risk (four
patients). Nonetheless, it seems likely that

age are ultimately palliative in this condition
and that most patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis will eventually require liver trans￾plantation. With this in mind, endoscopic place￾ment of endoprosthesis seems to be the drainage
procedure of choice as it may avoid the disadvan￾tages of surgical or percutaneous methods. A
coordinated multicentre prospective study is
required to assess the best means of biliary
intervention in these patients and to determine
whether broader criteria for such intervention
are justified. 1 Chapman RWG, Arbough BAM, Rhodes J, et al. Primary
