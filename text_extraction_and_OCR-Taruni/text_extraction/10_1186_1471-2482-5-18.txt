Abstract
Background: Kupffer cell-dependent ischemia / reperfusion (I/R) injury after liver transplantation
is still of high clinical relevance, as it is strongly associated with primary dysfunction and primary
nonfunction of the graft. Glycine, a non-toxic, non-essential amino acid has been conclusively
shown in various experiments to prevent both activation of Kupffer cells and reperfusion injury.
Based on both experimental and preliminary clinical data this study protocol was designed to
further evaluate the early effect of glycine after liver transplantation.
Methods / design: A prospective double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled multicenter
study with two parallel groups in a total of 130 liver transplant recipients was designed to assess
the effect of multiple intravenous doses of glycine after transplantation. Primary endpoints in
hierarchical order are: peak levels of both aspartat-amino-transaminase (AST) and alanine-amino￾transaminase (ALT) as surrogates for the progression of liver related injury, as well as both graft
and patient survival up to 2 years after transplantation. Furthermore, the effect of glycine on
cyclosporine A-induced nephrotoxicity is evaluated.
Discussion: The ongoing clinical trial represents an advanced element of the research chain, along
which a scientific hypothesis has to go by, in order to reach the highest level of evidence; a
randomized, prospective, controlled double-blinded clinical trial. If the data of this ongoing research
project confirm prior findings, glycine would improve the general outcome after liver
transplantation.

Background
Pathophysiology of liver grafts
The cause of graft failure after transplantation is complex
and includes many factors involving organ retrieval, pres￾ervation, and the transplantation procedure itself. Impor￾tant factors include general condition and nutritional
status of the donor, cold and warm ischemic times of the
graft, operative complications in the recipient, immune
status of the recipient and the experience of the surgeon
[1,2]. Thus, primary non function (PNF), which is initially
determined by reperfusion injury, continues to challenge
liver transplantation.
Once activated, Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages in
the liver, play a pivotal role for the development of both
PNF and primary dysfunction (PDF) [2,3]. Kupffer cell￾activation is characterized by an intracellular increase of
Ca2+ [4] with a subsequent release of toxic mediators such
as proteases, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and ara￾chidonic acid derivatives [5,6]. These mediators poten￾tially impair liver function via mechanisms including
disturbance of the intrahepatic microcirculation, hypoxia,
increased oxygen consumption, and depletion of hepatic
glycogen reserves [2].
Fusaoka et al. [7] showed that activated Kupffer cells
increase oxygen uptake of the liver after cold storage. This
effect is most likely due to Kupffer cell-derived prostaglan￾dine E2 (PGE2), which stimulates oxygen uptake in hepa￾tocytes and could be involved in early dysfunction of the
graft [8]. Indeed, graft survival is impaired after liver trans￾plantation most likely via mechanisms including both
hypoxia and increased oxygen consumption of hepato￾cytes, creating a hypermetabolic state [8]. Activation of
Kupffer cells occurs early during organ harvest for trans￾plantation due to in situ organ manipulation, which is
inevitable with standard harvesting techniques [1,8,9].
Glycine
Glycine, a non-toxic, non-essential amino acid is impor￾tant for the synthesis of many proteins, i.e. creatinine, uric
acid, and heme. Under physiological conditions, blood
levels of glycine range between 200–400 µmol/L in
humans [10,11].
Clinical use of glycine
To date various indications for supplementation with gly￾cine have been established, i.e. for total parenteral nutri￾tion, local irrigation during transurethral prostate or urine
bladder resections, being a hypotonic solution and having
the capacity as an antacidotic agent.
Cytoprotective effects of glycine
Addition of amino acids during renal perfusion can pro￾tect tubular integrity and can prolong renal function [12].
Weinberg et al. were the first to connect this protective
effect with the amino acid glycine [13]. Glycine protects
tissue against damage via mechanisims involving proin￾flammatory mediators, hypoxia reduction, reperfusion
enhancement and toxin attenuation in various animal
species [10-15].
Glycine inhibits nonlysosomal calcium-dependent pro￾teases and protects hepatocytes against anoxic damage.
Ozaki et al. demonstrated that glycine could protect livers
in situ from reperfusion damage by minimizing lipid per￾oxidation [16]. Glycine could stabilize the cell membrane
by inhibiting phospholipase A2 leading to a reduction of
arachidonic acid and eicosanoids which influence hepatic
microcirculation [17]. Carolina rinse solution which con￾tains glycine, prevents reperfusion injury to livers in both
experimental and human liver transplantation [18]. Intra￾venous glycine application also prevents Kupffer cell￾dependent reperfusion injury in rats [9,19].
Kupffer cells
Most recently, a glycine-gated chloride channel (GlyR) has
been identified within the membranes of Kupffer cells
[10,11,20]. Glycine specifically binds to its receptor. Sub￾sequently, chloride ions enter the cell resulting in the
hyperpolarization of the cell membrane and making a
Ca2+ influx via voltage dependent Ca2+-channels more dif￾ficult, which effectively reduces the increase of intracellu￾lar Ca2+ [4,9,14,20-22]. As a result, glycine reliably
prevents Kupffer cell-dependent reperfusion injury and
initial dysfunction of grafts after experimental liver trans￾plantation [1,2,9].
Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced nephrotoxicity
Cyclosporin A (CyA), a calcineurin inhibitor, is widely
used as an immunosuppressive agent. Since its introduc￾tion in solid organ transplantation, CyA has significantly
improved the overall graft survival; however, patients
have to maintain therapy for the rest of their lives. Further,
this drug is used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases.
Unfortunately, one of the typical side effects of CNIs is
dose dependent nephrotoxicity, which is of clinical rele￾vance in up to 30% of patients [23]. Underlying mecha￾nisms most likely include the CyA significant inhibition
of respiration in mitochondria isolated from the kidney
[24], and thus causing cell damage. Further, CNI-induced
nephrotoxicity is characterized by vasoconstriction in kid￾neys [25], reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and
pathological changes such as proximal tubular cell swell￾ing, necrosis, infiltration of macrophages, and interstitial
fibrosis [23]. These changes potentially lead to hypoxia￾reoxygenation injury involving free radicals. Indeed, a pre￾vious study showed that binding of a 2-nitroimidazole
hypoxia marker, pimonidazole, in the kidney was

BMC Surgery 2005, 5:18 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2482/5/18
Page 3 of 8
(page number not for citation purposes)
increased nearly 3-fold by CyA, indicating marked tissue
hypoxia [26].
Most recently, glycine prevented hypoxic and ischemic
injury to kidney in rats [26]. This can be explained by the
fact that glycine acts as a neurotransmitter with inhibitory
effects to the autonomous nervous system, i.e. sympathic
nerves [27], decreasing renal nerve firing. This mechanism
prevents injury due to CyA [28]. As a result, glycine dilates
efferent arterioles and protects cultured proximal tubules
from hypoxic injury [29]. Moreover, dietary glycine totally
blocked CyA-induced alterations in renal function, such
as decreased GFR and pathological changes including cell
necrosis and infiltration of macrophages [26,30,31].
Study rationale
Both experimental studies and clinical trials [8,9,32-34]
have shown that glycine is safe for use in patients
[21,22,35-37] and would potentially be beneficial for the
treatment of various diseases [10,11]. There is preliminary
evidence for beneficial effects of glycine in human liver
transplantation [21,22]. However, there is still a lack of
solid clinical evidence for these effects of glycine in liver
transplantation. The first clinical results with intravenous
glycine are very promising [21,22]. Thus to date there is
no routine indication for glycine application to liver trans￾plant recipients and no intravenous infusion containing
exclusively glycine is commercially available yet.
Based on the beneficial effects of glycine on both liver
grafts and kidney function during CyA therapy
[26,30,31,38] and its potential application in humans
without toxicity, this clinical trial protocol was designed
to assess the effects of intravenous glycine in a prospec￾tive, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, mul￾ticenter study with two parallel groups of liver transplant
recipients for the first time in detail.
Methods / design
After the positive vote of the ethics committee of all
involved study sites, enrollment of 130 subjects scheduled
for liver transplantation was started in this multicenter,
prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, rand￾omized clinical trial with two parallel treatment groups
(verum / placebo). Only patients who meet all inclusion
and exclusion criteria (Table 1) are considered for uptake
into the study. Since its initiation in May 2003, about 69
patients have been included until June 2005.
Patients are treated for a total of 8 consecutive days (day
of transplantation and the seven following days). Subse￾quently, all patients are observed for an additional follow￾up period of at least 23 days. Thus every patient is
observed for at least one month (Figure 1). In detail, to
assess the incidence of a late onset of graft failure based on
patients' death or patients' announcement for re-trans￾plantation all patients will be followed-up until one
month after the last patient is randomized for this trial.
Patients' status will be obtained via phone interview of the
patients' general practitioner and / or the responsible
transplant consulting office. The Schedule for all study
related activities and data collection is listed in Table 2.
Objectives and endpoints
The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate both
efficacy and safety of glycine treatment compared to pla￾cebo in the postoperative period during the first eight days
after liver transplantation and during the long-term fol￾low-up. Secondary objectives are reperfusion injury to the
graft and mortality. Furthermore, it will be investigated
whether CyA-induced nephrotoxicity can be reduced by
glycine.
Both AST and ALT peaks are expected to be surrogates of
the extent of reperfusion injury. AST and ALT are the most
common parameters for progression of liver related dis￾ease. An increase of these transaminases correlates with
both primary failure of the organ and graft injury with
Table 1: Criteria of inclusion and exclusion of patients.
Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria
Patients meeting all of the following criteria are considered for inclusion 
in the study:
Patients presenting with any of the following are not be included in the 
trial:
- men and women between 18 and 65 years of age, - pregnant or nursing women,
- scheduled for first liver transplantation and graft (dead body) already 
available,
- history of hypersensitivity to glycine or to drugs with a similar chemical 
structure (amino acids, e.g. serine, threonine, or methionine),
- written informed consent. - mental conditions rendering the subject incapable to understand the 
nature, scope, and consequences of the trial,
- participation in another clinical trial.
No subject will be enrolled in this study more than once.

subsequent organ dysfunction. Thus peak serum level of
AST, measured at intensive care unit (ICU) entry and
within the first 8 days after transplantation, has been cho￾sen as the most important primary endpoint of this trial.
Further primary endpoints ordered hierarchically are ALT
peak during the same period and graft survival based on
patients' death or announcement for re-transplantation
(minimum observation period 31 days). The last reflects
the potential clinical benefit for the patient.
Secondary endpoints are the effect of glycine on liver
injury based on liver biopsy immediately after re-arterial￾isation (according to pathological report), total blood
flow in portal vein and common hepatic artery 1 hour
after reperfusion, graft injury based on both AST and ALT
serum levels (area under the curve (AUC)), incidence of
early graft failure based on peak of transaminases or clot￾ting factor support, early onset of graft dysfunction based
on Quick's value, serum bilirubin (AUC), and CyA￾induced nephrotoxicity based on retention parameters
during the first eight days after transplantation (AUC).
Sample size calculation
The sample size calculation is based on the AST peak, the
most important primary endpoint in this trial. According
to historic data of about 450 liver transplant recipients at
the Department of Surgery, University of Heidelberg, a
log-normal distribution of the AST peaks is plausible with
a standard deviation of 1.01 for the log (AST peak)-values
(details are available on request). These data served for the
sample size calculation of this trial. A decreased AST-peak
by 300 U/L is considered clinically relevant. Thus a sam￾ple size of 65 patients per group, i.e. a total of 130
patients, is sufficient to detect differences with a power of
80%, taking into account the planned interim analysis
(two-sided t-test for the log (AST peaks), overall level of
significance α = 0.05) (nQuery® 4.0, EaSt®-2000). Details
on transformation of the clinically relevant difference on
the original scale to a clinically relevant difference on the
log scale used for sample size calculation are available on
request.
Randomization and treatment
Here a 1:1 randomization ratio has been chosen. Rand￾omization is stratified for each center and for the duration
of cold ischemia (≤ 10 hrs or >10 hrs). The study medica￾tion is produced, labeled, and packed by a Clinical Phar￾macy Department. The guideline for good manufacturing
practice (GMP) is adhered to. The intravenous medication
for the verum group contains 250 ml glycine solution
(4.4%; 11 g glycine, dissolved in aqua ad injectione). In
contrast the placebo consisted of 250 mL of the vehicle
(aqua ad injectionem) have to be infused to patients.
All patients receive their first study medication via a cen￾tral venous line during liver transplantation one hour
prior to reperfusion. During the following week, on post
operative days (POD) 1 to 7, the study medication is

infused once per day in the morning, after taking blood
and urine samples for safety and efficacy parameters. A
last visit is scheduled for POD 8 to investigate the patients'
clinical status and to collect all parameters for efficacy and
safety. To detect late graft failures all patients are observed
after the initial first eight days until the last patient is
enrolled in this trial. These patients will then be observed
for at least 31 days after transplantation. A late graft failure
is defined as patients' death or announcement for re￾transplantation.
If it is medically imperative to know the patient's treat￾ment, emergency envelopes contain the information on
the subject's study medication. Those are to be opened
only under emergency circumstances. During the trial a
concomitant treatment may be given at the discretion of
the investigator, if these are considered necessary for the
subject's welfare.
All patients routinely receive standard immunosuppres￾sive therapy. The initial dose of CyA is 2 × 2 mg/kg body
weight during the first 24 hrs. Subsequently, daily doses of
CyA are adapted to the actual CyA serum level which is
measured in the blood samples taken in the morning of
POD 1 to 8. The trough concentration should be between
200–250 µg/L during the first month after liver transplan￾tation. In case of renal insufficiency FK506 can be used
alternatively.
The amount of coagulation factors and AT III, red blood
cells, and fresh frozen plasma given after transplantation
are documented until the morning of POD 8.
Adverse events
All adverse events (AE) are recorded. Events related to the
initial diagnosis for liver transplantation, to the transplan￾tation procedure itself, or problems associated with rou￾tine procedures after transplantation, i.e. liver biopsy, are
not to be noted as AE or serious adverse event (SAE)
unless the investigator deems the events to be a cause of
the study drug. All SAE potentially associated with the
application of study medication must be documented on

a "Serious Adverse Event" form which has to sent to the
principal investigator (LKP, according to German Drug
Law) within 24 hrs or latest on the following working day.
The LKP ensures that SAE are reported to the safety board,
ethics committees, and to further investigators, if
applicable.
Quality assurance
The study is performed according to the principles of the
ICH-GCP guidelines [39] and the ethical principles
according to the current revision of the Declaration of
Helsinki [40] and local legal and regulatory requirements.
The trial is monitored by the KKS Heidelberg according to
Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) that are based on
ICH-GCP guidelines.
An independent safety board monitors closely the proper
conduct of the trial and all SAE reports to ensure the safety
of the subjects during the course of the study.
Statistics and data management
All findings including both the clinical and laboratory
findings are documented in the subject's case report form
(CRF). All data are entered in a database as recorded. To
ensure highest data quality a double data entry is per￾formed. All missing data or inconsistencies are reported
back to the center(s) and clarified by the responsible
investigator. If no further corrections of the database are
to be made it will be declared closed and used for statisti￾cal analysis.
The primary endpoints of the trial are peak serum levels of
both AST and ALT measured within the first 8 days after
transplantation, and graft survival based on patients death
or announcement for re-transplantation.
Therefore the statistical hypotheses to be tested are as
follows:
H0: ASTglycine = ASTplacebo vs. H1: ASTglycine ≠ ASTplacebo,
(1)
H0: ALTglycine = ALTplacebo vs. H1: ALTglycine ≠ ALTplacebo,
(2)
H0: Sglycine = Splacebo vs. H1: Sglycine ≠ Splacebo, (3)
While ASTglycine and ASTplacebo represent the distribution of
AST peaks in the glycine and placebo group, respectively,
ALTglycine and ALTplacebo represent the distribution of ALT
peaks in the two groups, and Sglycine and Splacebo represent
the survival functions of the two groups regarding graft
survival.
The statistical hypotheses formulated above will be tested,
each at the level of significance α (see below), in the strict
order (1), (2), (3), i.e. a statistical testing procedure with
a priori ordered hypotheses is applied [41].
All analyses are done according to the principle of inten￾tion-to-treat. Additional analyses (per protocol popula￾tion, sensitivity analyses) will be described in the
statistical analysis plan in more detail before closure of
the database.
In the interim analysis only safety parameters and the pri￾mary endpoints AST peak and ALT peak will be evaluated.
Data for the third primary endpoint (graft survival) are
collected only at the end of the trial. The interim analysis
is performed according to the group sequential design of
O'Brien and Fleming [42]. The overall level of significance
is α = 0.05, i.e. the level of significance for the interim
analysis is α 1 = 0.0035, the level of significance for the
final analysis is α2 = 0.0488.
If a patient dies or a re-transplantation has to be per￾formed during the clinical period, serum measurements
are not available. As this is the worst possible outcome,
patients will be allocated the worst ranks for the respective
(non-parametric) analyses.
Sensitivity analyses regarding the methods for dealing
with missing values will be performed. Further details
regarding the handling of missing data will be laid down
in the statistical analysis plan that will be completed
before unblinding of the data.
Discussion
This ongoing clinical trial particularly demonstrates how
a scientific hypothesis has been developed from bench to
bedside, with classical investigations along the value
chain of translational research from early in vitro work to
in vivo experiments and finally from single case observa￾tions to the highest level of evidence, a randomized, pro￾spective, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. If
previous findings are confirmed by the data of this ongo￾ing clinical trial, glycine would improve the overall out￾come after liver transplantation.
