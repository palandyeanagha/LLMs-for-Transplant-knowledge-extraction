Abstract
Renal ischemia-reperfusion is a main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with high mortality. Here
we show that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from hiPSC-MSCs play a critical role in protection against renal I/R
injury. hiPSC-MSCs-EVs can fuse with renal cells and deliver SP1 into target cells, subsequently active SK1 expression
and increase S1P formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses and luciferase assay were used to confirm
SP1 binds directly to the SK1 promoter region and promote promoter activity. Moreover, SP1 inhibition (MIT) or SK1
inhibition (SKI-II) completely abolished the renal protective effect of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs in rat I/R injury mode. However,
pre-treatment of necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 showed no difference with the administration of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs only.
We then generated an SP1 knockout hiPSC-MSC cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that SP1 knockout failed to
show the protective effect of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs unless restoring the level of SP1 by Ad-SP1 in vitro and in vivo. In
conclusion, this study describes an anti-necroptosis effect of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs against renal I/R injury via delivering SP1
into target renal cells and intracellular activating the expression of SK1 and the generation of S1P. These findings
suggest a novel mechanism for renal protection against I/R injury, and indicate a potential therapeutic approach for a
variety of renal diseases and renal transplantation.

therapies, the mortality associated with AKI remains
high3,4
. Our limited understanding of the complex cell
death mechanism in the process of AKI impedes the
development of desirable therapeutics5
. For a long time,
apoptosis was recognized as the main form of cell death
that is responsible for renal dysfunction in AKI6
.
Therefore, strategies targeting the apoptosis pathway
have been widely explored for AKI treatment7
. Despite
the substantial therapeutic effect in animal models, the
efficient anti-apoptosis intervention strategies are still
absented in clinic. This could be partly ascribed to our
limited understanding of the complex cell death
mechanism in the process of AKI. Necroptosis is a
recently identified novel form of cell death contributing
to numerable diseases and tissue damages8–11. Increas￾ing evidence has suggested that necroptosis has an
important role in the pathogenesis of various types of
AKI12–19. However, the signaling pathways and main
regulators of necroptosis in the process of AKI remain
unclear.
Recently, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived
from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have
been used in pre-clinical studies and showed better per￾formance compared to the adult MSCs in terms of cell
proliferation, immunomodulation, cytokines profiles,
production of microenvironment modulating EVs, and
secretion of bioactive paracrine factors20,21. It has been
shown that hiPSC-MSCs can prevent I/R damage in the
kidney, liver, and heart22–26. However, the underlying
mechanism of the protective effect of hiPSC-MSCs is still
unclear.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-contained
vesicles released in an evolutionally conserved manner by
cells including MSCs. EV-mediated signals can be trans￾mitted by all the different biomolecule categories such as
proteins and nucleic acids (mRNA, miRNA, and other
non-coding RNAs)27. Over the past few years, evidence
has been shown that EVs are widely demonstrated to be
implicated in cellular signaling during renal regenerative
and pathological processes and participate in kidney
development and normal physiology28–32. Although many
EVs mechanisms are still poorly understood, in particular
in the kidney, the discovery of their role could help to
shed light on renal biological processes which are so far
elusive. Recently, EVs secreted from MSCs or stem cells
have been shown to play a critical role in protection
against I/R injury in the liver, kidney, and heart26,33–37.
Whether hiPSC-MSC-derived EVs are implicated in the
healing properties of MSC-derived vesicles in AKI has not
yet been investigated.
In this study, we investigated the renal protective effect
of hiPSC-MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles (hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs) on renal I/R injury, as well as the underlying
mechanisms. We demonstrated that hiPSC-MSCs-EVs
could reduce renal I/R injury via transcriptional activating
of sphingosine kinase (SK) 1 and inhibiting necroptosis.
Our study represents a potential mechanism for renal
protection and has important implications for new ther￾apeutic approaches to acute kidney diseases.
Results
Generation of hiPSC-MSCs and characterization of hiPSC￾MSCs secreted EVs
Firstly, hiPSCs were successfully induced into hiPSCs￾MSCs and grew in a monolayer with large spindle-shaped
morphology at the colony border (Fig. 1a). Immuno￾fluorescence staining was used to assess the surface
antigens of hiPSCs (SOX2) before induction (Fig. 1a).
Flow cytometry was also used to identify the surface
antigens in differentiated hiPSCs-MSCs. The results
showed that hiPSC-MSCs were negative for CD34, CD45,
and HLADR, but positive for CD29, CD90, and CD105
(Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the EVs secreted from hiPSCs￾MSCs were isolated and subjected to biochemical and
biophysical analyses. Electron microscopy analysis on EVs
exhibited expected cup-shaped morphology (Fig. 1c). The
EVs size was quantified by a Zetasizer Nano and the mean
vesicle diameter was 135 nm (Fig. 1c). Biochemical ana￾lysis of EVs showed positive expression of the EVs pro￾teins Alix, CD63, and CD81 (Fig. 1c). We also evaluated
the relation between the protein content and the EVs
number and found that there are about 1010 particles of
EVs in 1 µg EVs (Fig. 1d).
EVs secreted from hiPSC-MSCs ameliorated renal I/R injury
To evaluate the effect of hiPSC-MSCs-derived EVs on
renal I/R injury, EVs were injected into the rat I/R
injury model. Compared with control (phosphate-buf￾fered saline (PBS) alone injection), administration of
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs (intravenous administration of 1012
particles at 1 h before IR) significantly improved the
kidney health. Pathologists scored the histology of these
kidneys were based on reflecting the grading of tubular
necrosis, loss of brush border, cast formation, and
tubular dilatation in 10 randomly chosen, non￾overlapping fields and in a single-blinded way. The
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs-treated group showed lower scores
than the corresponding control group (Fig. 2a). By 48 h
after the IR procedure, the serum levels of creatinine
(Fig. 2b) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (Fig. 2c), two
indices of renal dysfunction, were markedly increased in
the IR group and significantly decreased in the Exo+I/R
group. Reoxygenation following ischemia causes tissue
oxidative stress, which is considered an important
contributor to IRI. Following ischemia–reperfusion,
malondialdehyde (MDA) content (Fig. 2d) was greatly
increased, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity
(Fig. 2e) was greatly decreased in kidneys, indicating

elevated levels of oxidative stress. However, adminis￾tration of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs dramatically attenuated
the increased MDA content and decreased SOD
activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs treatment could ameliorate renal I/R
injury.
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs inhibited necroptosis in renal tubular
cells, HK-2 cells during hypoxia/reoxygenation injury
We next assessed whether the protection by hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs was due to inhibition of apoptosis or
necroptosis. Firstly, we examined the transfer of EVs
components with HK-2 cells. The EVs were labeled with a

cell membrane marker PKH67 prior to incubation with
HK-2 cells. The results showed that EVs membranes were
directly incorporated into the HK-2 cell plasma mem￾brane (Fig. 3a). To determine the effect of hiPSC-MSCs￾EVs during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury, HK-2
cells were pre-treated with hiPSC-MSCs-EVs (1011, 3 ×
1011, 1012 particles) and then subjected to H/R treatment.
As shown in Fig. 3b, compared with that of control cells,
cell proliferation was markedly inhibited after H/R treat￾ment (p < 0.05). Consistently, in cultured HK-2 cells, H/R
treatment increased the MDA content (p < 0.05) but
decreased SOD activity (p < 0.05). However, hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs dose-dependently preserved the cell pro￾liferation and SOD activity against H/R injury also
decreased the MDA content.
Annexin V/PI positivity is an established readout for
both apoptotic and necroptotic cell death and allows
distinguishing programmed cell death between apoptosis
and necroptosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed a
markedly increase in apoptotic and necrotic cells (Fig￾ure 3c). However, hiPSC-MSCs-EVs treatment dramati￾cally ameliorates the H/R elevated necroptosis, but not

apoptosis. Moreover, the protective effect of 3 × 1011 and
1012 particles of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs seems the same. Taken
together, these results provide the first evidence that
inhibited necroptosis in kidney cells is critical in the
protective effect of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs against renal I/R
injury.
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs directly deliver SP1 into HK-2 cells,
transcriptionally increase SK expression and (3

sphinganine-1-phosphate (S1P) formation

from hiPSC-MSCs-EVs could protect hepatocytes against
hepatic I/R injury via activating SK and S1P-dependent

pathway38. To investigate whether this pathway is also
involved in renal protection, we firstly measured the
mRNA and protein level changes of SK1 after hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs treatment in HK-2 cells, and found a marked
increase in SK1 protein levels in a dose-dependent man￾ner (Figure 4a). Then S1P content, SK activity, and (3
H)
S1P formation were measured in H/R-injured HK-2 cells
treated with hiPSC-MSCs-EVs. The results showed that
after hiPSC-MSCs-EVs treatment for 48 h, S1P content,
SK activity, and (3
H) S1P formation were dose￾dependently increased (Fig. 4b).
To further investigate the mechanism by which hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs induce increase SK activity, the content of
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs was analyzed and found that EVs
contained abundant amounts of specificity protein 1
(SP1), a potential transcript factor of SK1, but no
detectable SK1 (Figure 4c). Furthermore, the level of SP1
in HK-2 cells was evaluated by western blot (Fig. 4d). The
protein level of SP1 in HK-2 cells was significantly
decreased, but dose-dependently increased after hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs treatment. However, the mRNA level of SP1
was unchanged (Fig. 4e). This suggested that hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs may protect HK-2 cells through directly deli￾vering SP1 into HK-2 cells.
We next accessed the promoter activity of SK1 and
found a similar increase with the protein level (Figure 4f).
We strongly hypothesized that SP1 promoted SK1 gene
expression through a direct interaction with the ~0.5–0.6
kb upstream of the SK1 gene promoter. A chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed. As
illustrated in Fig. 4a, we found specific binding of SP1 to
the ~0.5–0.6 kb region of the SK1 promoter, which con￾tained the binding sequence. These data indicate that SP1
interacted with the binding sequence of the SK1 promoter
in HK-2 cells. We also used a luciferase reporter construct
containing the SK1 promoter with the ~0.6 kb region to
monitor SK1 transcription. Overexpression of SP1 caused
statistically significant increase in the SK1 promoter
activity compared to the empty vector control. In con￾trast, overexpression of SP1 had no statistically significant
effect on the pGL3–0.5 kb-luc construct, which did not
contain the binding sequence (Fig. 5b). These results
suggest that hiPSC-MSCs-EVs directly delivery SP1 into
HK-2 cells, subsequently increase SK expression and
improve (3H) sphinganine-1-phosphate (S1P) formation.
Generation of SP1 knockout hiPSC cell line and hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs
To further confirm the hypothesis that SP1 activated
SK1–S1P pathway is critical for the protective effect of
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs, we generated an SP1 knockout hiPSC
cell line via the CRISPR/Cas system. We first set out to
identify an appropriate target site in SP11 for gene editing.
The site was selected from a bioinformatic database of 20-
bp target-protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences in
the human exome that was filtered to minimize off-target
cross-reactivity. From a list of several candidates, we
chose a target sequence of the human SP1 cDNA (Fig. 6a).
Once identified, an oligo pair containing the guide
sequence was cloned into pX330, a bicistronic vector that

constructs containing ~0.5 and ~0.6 kb of the SK1 promoter with or without the predicted binding site. Luciferase activity was compared to the
control. Data are presented as means ± SEM; the results were from three independent experiments; statistical significance: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01, ***p

contains the Cas9 enzyme and the programmable chi￾meric sgRNA39. We transfected the px330-SP1 sgRNA
and a plasmid encoding GFP into hiPSC cells and isolated
the transfected cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS). The sorted cells were then plated as individual
clones in 96-well plates and expanded. Five clones were
probed; exon 3 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA
extracted for further sequencing. Sequence analysis of

measured in culture medium between control and SP1 konckout hsPSC-MSCs cells. g The SP1 expression was analyzed in SP1 knockout hiPSCs￾MSCs-Exo by western blotting with SP1-specific antibody. Data are presented as means ± SEM; the results were from three independent experiments;

amplicons revealed a mixed population of mutated alleles.
We detect one wild-type alleles in clones 3 and 5, while in
the other three clones, all of the genomic DNA sequences
that were identified contained deletions or insertions that
created nonfunctional gene products (Fig. 6b). Taken
together with the complete lack of detectable SP1 protein
expression by western blotting (Fig. 6c) with SP1-specific
antibody, these findings confirm the generation of two
SP1 knockout cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.
We selected clone two hiPSC cells for the further
experiments. Immunofluorescence staining assessed the
surface antigens of hiPSCs (SOX2) before induction and

showed no difference between control and SP1 knockout
hiPSC cells (Fig. 6d). Moreover, upon analyzing the effect
of adipogenic and osteogenetic inductions on hiPSCs￾MSCs, SP1 knockout hiPSC-MSCs fulfill a similarly
multipotential role by differentiating into cells staining
positive with alizarin red and oil red O, respectively
(Fig. 6e). To test whether SP1 knockout affect the release
of EVs from hiPSCs-MSCs, we measured the number of
EVs in culture medium between control and SP1 knock￾out hiPSC-MSCs cells (Fig. 6f). At last, the SP1 expression
was completely undetectable in SP1 knockout hiPSCs￾MSCs-Exo by western blotting with SP1-specific antibody
(Fig. 6g).
SP1–SK1–S1P signaling pathway is critical to the anti￾necroptosis effect of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs on H/R-injured HK-2
cells in vitro
To further demonstrate the hypothesis that SP1 acti￾vated SK1–S1P pathway is critical for the renal protective
effect of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs, wild type or SP1 knockout
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs, combined with Nec-1 (necrostatin-1, a
necroptosis inhibitor40, 10 μM), MIT (Mithramycin A, an
SP1 inhibitor41, binding to GC-rich DNA and displacing
SP1 transcription factor, 10 μM), or SKI-II (an SK inhi￾bitor42, 5 μM) was given to HK-2 cell that underwent H/R
injury. As shown in Fig. 7a, the S1P content, SK activity,
and (3
H) S1P formation were parallel in H/R-injured HK￾2 cells treated with wild-type hiPSC-MSCs-EVs (WT)
with or without Nec-1 treatment. After SP1 inhibition
with MIT or SK inhibition with SKI-II in HK-2 cells,
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs failed to increase the S1P content, SK
activity, and (3
H) S1P formation in H/R-injured HK-2
cells (Fig. 7a). EVs from SP1 knockout hiPSC-MSCs also
cannot increase the level of S1P content, SK activity, and
(
3
H) S1P formation (Fig. 7a). However, adenovirus￾mediated overexpression of SP1 in SP1 knockout hiPSC￾MSC cells restored the promoting effect of secreted EVs
on S1P content, SK activity, and (3
H) S1P formation
(Fig. 7a). These results suggested the specific role of SP1
in the hiPSC-MSCs-EVs on the activation of SK1–S1P
pathway.
Similarly, Nec-1 failed to improve the protective effect
of wild-type hiPSC-MSCs-EVs on decreased cell pro￾liferation, increased MDA content, and decreased SOD
activity (Fig. 7b). After SP1 inhibition with MIT or SK
inhibition with SKI-II in HK-2 cells, hiPSC-MSCs-EVs
showed no effect on the cell proliferation, MDA content,
and SOD activity in H/R-injured HK-2 cells (Fig. 7b).
EVs from SP1 knockout hiPSC-MSCs also failed to
preserve these parameters (Fig. 7b), yet adenovirus￾mediated overexpression of SP1 in SP1 knockout hiPSC￾MSC cells restored the protective effect of secreted EVs
on these parameters of cell viability (Fig. 7b). These
results suggested the specific role of SP1 activated
SK1–S1P pathway on the protective effect against H/R
injury.
At last, Nec-1 unable to further inhibit necroptosis
during H/R injury in hiPSC-MSCs-EVs-treated HK-2 cells
(Fig. 7c). Meanwhile, both SP1 and SKI-II inhibition
completely abolished the anti-necroptosis effect of hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs (Fig. 7c). After SP1 knockout in hiPSC-MSCs,
the secreted EVs can no longer decrease the H/R-induced
necroptosis in HK-2 cells unless restoring the level of SP1
by Ad-SP1 (Fig. 7c). These data prove that hiPSC-MSCs￾EVs deliver SP1 to the target HK-2 cells and result in
intracellular activation of SK1 expression and generation
of S1P, which inhibit H/R-induced necroptosis.
SP1–SK1–S1P signaling pathway is critical to the anti￾necroptosis effect of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs against renal I/R
injury in vivo
To demonstrate the specific role of SP1 activated
SK1–S1P pathway in the renal protective effect of hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs in vivo, rats were injected with hiPSC-MSCs￾EVs. As expected, treatment of rats with EVs from wild￾type hiPSC-MSCs-EVs (WT) resulted in significant renal
protections with the decreased pathologists score
(Fig. 8a), creatinine, MDA content, BUN, and the pre￾served SOD activity (Fig. 8b). Next, the necroptosis inhi￾bitor Nec-1 (100 mg/kg), SP1 inhibitor MIT (60 mg/kg),
or SK inhibitor SKI-II (50 mg/kg) was subcutaneously
administered to rats at 15 min before the administration
of wild-type hiPSC-MSCs-EVs (WT). As expected, pre￾treatment of Nec-1 (WT+Nec-1) showed no difference
with the administration of wild-type hiPSC-MSCs-EVs
only, which suggested that hiPSC-MSCs-EVs mainly
protect the renal cell via inhibition necroptosis. However,
SP1 inhibition (WT+MIT) or SK1 inhibition (WT+SKI￾II) completely abolished the renal protective effect of
hiPSC-MSCs-EVs in a rat I/R injury model, demonstrated
by changes in histopathologic score (Fig. 8a), the serum
levels of creatinine, MDA content and BUN, and the SOD
activity (Fig. 8b). We then isolated EVs from hiPSC￾derived MSCs in which SP1 had been knocked out by the
CRISPR/Cas9 system (SP1 KO). Like previous in vitro
experiments, SP1 KO EVs failed to diminish the renal
injury, while SP1 overexpression in SP1 knockout hiPSC￾MSCs by Ad-SP1 (SP1 KO+Ad-SP1) regained the renal
protective effect of secreted EVs. Taken together, these
results prove that hiPSC-MSCs-EVs deliver SP1 to the
target renal cells resulting in intracellular activation of
SK1 expression and generation of S1P which inhibits I/R
induce necroptosis in vivo.
Discussion
In this paper, we describe a novel and protection
function of hiPSC-MSCs secreted EVs against renal I/R
injury. Our results show that the EVs released by hiPSC￾Yuan et al. Cell Death and Disease (2017) 8:3200 Page 10 of 18
Official journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association

MSCs can protect renal cells against I/R-induced
necroptosis in a rat model. Mechanistically, the hiPSC￾MSCs-EVs can directly delivery SP1 into renal cells and
inhibit necroptosis via transcriptional activation of SK1
expression and generation of S1P. These findings largely
extend our current understanding of hiPSC-MSC-derived
EVs, and suggest that they may function to restore renal
function after injury, dysfunction, or disease. Further￾more, our data suggest that hiPSC-MSC-derived EVs
represent a novel therapeutic approach for kidney
diseases.
Recently, MSCs injection resulted in lower pro￾inflammatory and apoptotic scores, and higher anti￾inflammatory and mitogenic indices, thus effectively
ameliorating experimental AKI43–50. Because this positive
functional effect was accompanied by rapid disappearance
of administered MSCs from the kidney, it is supposed that
these cells act principally through paracrine mechanisms,

especially MSCs-derived EVs51–55. Due to the commonly
used adult MSCs derived from tissues have limited abil￾ities in proliferation, an alternate source of MSCs is in
need. The hiPSC-derived MSCs was found to be a
potential source of MSCs because the cells exhibited
better survival, proliferation, and differentiations poten￾tials20,21,35,56. However, the direct use of hiPSCs-MSCs is
limited due to the problems like potential immunological
rejection, chromosomal variation, and so on. As EVs are
considered to be an important mediator of hiPSCs-MSCs,
the therapeutic effects of hiPSCs-MSCs-derived EVs have
also been investigated extensively in various disease
models, and the results revealed that they could preserve
the function of myocardium and the hepatic function after
I/R injury24,36. Our current data reveal that hiPSCs￾MSCs-derived EVs may represent a novel highly sig￾nificant function to protect tissues against I/R injury. The
fact that EVs from SP1 knocked out hiPSCs-MSCs were
unable to induce renal protection demonstrates a specific
characteristic of hiPSCs-MSCs-Exo.
Our results demonstrate that the renal protective effects
of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs are mediated by activated SK1
expression and increased S1P formation. Importantly, our
results suggest that hiPSC-MSCs-EVs can fuse with renal
cells and delivery SP1 into target cells, subsequently and
transcriptionally active SK1 expression and increase S1P
formation. S1P has been shown to function as both an
extracellular ligand for specific G protein-coupled recep￾tors (GPCRs) as well as an intracellular second messenger
in promoting cell growth and survival57,58. Some other
studies have found that activation of SK, the enzyme
catalyzing the formation of S1P from its precursor
sphingosine, with a resultant increase in levels of S1P, and
activation of S1P receptors, which have been shown to be
involved in protection from IR injury in the heart42,57,58,
liver59, and kidney60,61. In this study, we initially found
that the SP1–SK1–S1P signaling pathway triggers the
renal protective effects via inhibiting necroptosis but nor
apoptosis. The necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 fails to further
improve renal protective effects of hiPSC-MSCs-EVs.
Undoubtedly, necroptosis and apoptosis coexist in the
pathophysiological process of AKI17,62. However, whether
necroptosis is relevant to the damage of kidney function
during AKI is challenged recently. Despite some limita￾tions in the detection techniques for apoptosis,62 the
effectiveness of anti-apoptosis therapeutic interventions
in previous studies have proven the contribution of
apoptosis to AKI62, which should not be neglected even
from current perspective. In fact, necroptosis, apoptosis,
and other modes of regulated cell death orchestrate the
pathogenesis of AKI together; and the relative contribu￾tion of each cell death to AKI depends on the type and
severity of the injury. In the present study, we initially
illustrate the certain contribution of necroptosis to the
renal dysfunction in AKI, and suppose that blocking
necroptosis in conjunction with current clinical treatment
can be applied to improve the therapeutic efficacy for
renal diseases.
In conclusion, we are the first to describe the anti￾necroptosis effect of hiPSC-MSCs-derived EVs against
renal I/R injury, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
we investigated the molecular mechanisms and found that
EVs could delivery SP1 into target renal cells and tran￾scriptionally activate the expression of SK1 and the gen￾eration of S1P (Fig. 9). These findings suggest a novel
mechanism for renal protection against I/R injury, and
indicate a potential therapeutic approach for a variety of
renal diseases and renal transplantation.
Materials and methods
Animals and reagents
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4–5 weeks of age) weighing
180–220 g were obtained from the Slac Laboratory Ani￾mal Center (Shanghai Slac Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd,
China). The experimental protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Transplantation Center of Ren Ji Hospital, School of
Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Necroptosis
inhibitor (Nec-1, necrostatin-1), Sphingosine kinase
inhibitor (SKI-II), and SP1 inhibitor (MIT, Mithramycin
A) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Renal I/R model
A rat model of renal IRI was established as previously
described63. Briefly, rats were fasted overnight, anesthe￾tized by an intraperitoneal injection of 3% pentobarbital
sodium (0.1 ml/100 g body weight), and subjected to an
abdominal incision. Their rectal temperatures were
maintained at 37 °C using a thermistor connected to a
servo-controlled heating pad (model D1-L; Haake, Tokyo,
Japan). The renal pedicles of the IRI group of rats were
dissected and clamped with non-traumatic clamps for 30
min. The renal pedicles were then reperfused in situ for
48 h, after which six rats from each group at each time
point were euthanized by decapitation, and their renal
tissues were carefully dissected for subsequent experi￾ments. Sham-operated control rats were subjected to an
abdominal incision but did not undergo clamping of the
renal pedicles. Blood samples were collected from indi￾vidual rats at each time point after reperfusion to measure
concentrations of serum creatinine and BUN by an
automatic biochemistry analyzer (Hitachi 7060).
Measurement of MDA content and SOD activity
Oxidative stress in the kidneys and HK-2 cells was
assessed by measuring the MDA content and SOD
activity. MDA is a terminal product of lipid peroxidation;
its intracellular concentration was determined with
Yuan et al. Cell Death and Disease (2017) 8:3200 Page 12 of 18

commercial kits (Beyotime) that use the thiobarbituric
acid method to form a red product with a maximum
absorbance at 535 nm. The results are reported as μmol
per milligram of extracted protein. The SOD activity in
the kidneys was detected using a Total Superoxide Dis￾mutase Assay Kit (Beyotime) and reported as U/mg
protein.
Histology
Kidneys were dissected as indicated in each experiment
and infused with 4% neutral-buffered formaldehyde, fix￾ated for 48 h, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and
xylene, and finally embedded in paraffin. The sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and then ana￾lyzed using an Axio Imager microscope (Zeiss, Oberko￾chen, Germany) at ×400 original magnification.
Micrographs were digitalized using an AxioCam MRm
Rev. 3 FireWire camera and AxioVision Rel. 4.5 software
(Zeiss). Organ damage was quantified by an experienced
pathologist in a double-blind manner on a scale ranging
from 0 (unaffected tissue) to 5 (severe organ damage).
hiPSCs-derived MSCs
The iPSCs were cultured in mTESR1 medium (StemCell
Technologies) to 90% confluency. Then mTESR1 was
replaced by MSC medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle's
Fig. 9 Schematic diagram of the proposed cellular mechanisms for the protection of hiPSC-MSCs-derived EVs after renal I/R injury. Based
on our data, we propose that hiPSC-MSCs-EVs alleviate renal I/R injury by delivering SP1 to the target renal cells and resulting in intracellular
activation of SK1 expression and generation of S1P, by which inhibits I/R-induced necroptosis

medium (DMEM)-low glucose supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mmol/l L-glutamine). After
2 weeks of culturing in MSC medium, cells were trypsi￾nized and expanded in 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes in MSC
medium. Cells were passaged until they developed the
fibroblast-like morphology. Then these cells were ready to
be used in the MSC phenotypic characteristics analysis
and further experiments. For the EVs isolation, conven￾tional culture medium was replaced with an exosome￾depleted FBS-contained (Exo-FBS-250 A-1; System
Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) medium when the
cells reached 70–80% confluence, and the MSCs were
cultured for an additional 72 h. The media were then
collected and EVs were isolated by the ExoQuick exosome
isolation method according to the manufacturer’s
instruction.
Immunofluorescence staining
For immunofluorescence staining, cultured hiPSCs and
hiPSCs-MSCs were fixed with 4% buffered paraf￾ormaldehyde in PBS, and incubated with blocking solu￾tion (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton X
in PBS) at room temperature for 2 h. Then cells were
incubated with primary antibodies against SOX2 (Abcam)
and CD90 (Abcam) diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After
that, appropriate secondary antibodies (Abcam) were
added and incubated with cells for 1 h at room tempera￾ture. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phe￾nylindole (DAPI; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 20 min
at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was examined
under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon 80i, Otawara,
Tochigi, Japan).
Flow cytometry
To analyze the characteristics of cultured hiPSC-MSCs,
cells were incubated with 1% BSA for 30 min (Gibco) in
PBS to block nonspecific antigens. Conjugated mono￾clonal antibodies (PE-CD34, PE-CD45, APC-HLA-DR￾PE, FITC-CD29, FITC-CD90, and FITC-CD105; Biole￾gends) were used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To evaluate the apoptosis level of HK-2 cells,
we analyzed the percentage of the early apoptotic cells
using an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples
were analyzed using an Epics xL flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, High Wycombe, UK).
Multipotential of hiPSC-MSCs
Osteogenesis and adipogenesis were examined to
determine the multipotential of hiPSC-MSCs. For induc￾tion, 1 × 105 hiPSC-MSCs were seeded in 24-well plates
until they reached 80% confluency, at which point the
medium was replaced with osteogenesis medium or adi￾pogenesis medium (ThermoFisher). The cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde after 21 days and stained in
alizarin red or oil red O for observation under a fluores￾cence microscope (Nikon 80i, Otawara, Tochigi, Japan).
Isolation of EVs
EVs were collected using Exoquick precipitation. Briefly,
cells were grown to 80% confluency and then cultured for
48 h. The condition medium was obtained and filtered by
a 0.45-lm PVDF filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to further
eliminate cellular debris. ExoQuick Precipitation Solution
(SBI System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) was added
to the supernatant and mixed well, and then the mixture
was precipitated by staying in 4 °C for 30 min. EVs were
harvested after centrifuging at 4 °C 1500 g for 30 min. EVs
pellets were re-suspended with PBS and their total protein
concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay
(ThermoFisher).
EVs characterization
EVs morphology was visualized by transmission elec￾tron microscopy. Briefly, EVs were diluted to 1 mg/ml
with PBS. Then, a specimen of EVs was spotted onto a
glow-discharged copper grid on the filter paper and dried
for 20 min under infrared lamp. Finally, the grid was
stained with 2% uranyl acetate at pH 7.0 for 40 s and air￾dried at room temperature. EVs were examined under
transmission electron microscopy (H-600 HITACHI
microscope, Japan) at 80 keV. The size of the EVs was
determined using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments,
Malvern, UK), and the purity was assessed by western blot
with EVs markers (Alix, CD63, and CD81). The number
of EVs was assessed by the CD81-antigen ELISA kit
(ThermoFisher).
Cell culture and H/R treatment
The human renal proximal tubular cell line HK-2 was
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Man￾assas, VA, USA), plated in 100-mm culture dishes, and
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Ther￾moFisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 U/ml penicillin, 2 mM glutamine, 100 μg/ml strepto￾mycin, and 1 mM HEPES buffer. The cultures were
incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2.
The medium was replaced every other day. For the H/R
group, cells were exposed to hypoxia (5% CO2, 1% O2, and
94% N2) for 12 h followed by 24 h of reoxygenation (5%
CO2, 21% O2, and 74% N2).
Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SP1 in SP1
knockout hiPSC-MSC cells
A recombinant adenovirus encoding human SP1 (Ad￾SP1) was constructed and generated by Genelily Biotech,
Inc. (Shanghai, China) as previously described using a
reverse genetic method. SP1 expression mRNA and protein
Yuan et al. Cell Death and Disease (2017) 8:3200 Page 14 of 18

expression was verified using RT-qPCR and western blot
assay. SP1 knockout hiPSC-MSC cells were infected with a
multiplicity of infection of 10 purified Ad-SP1.
Cell viability assay
At the end of the indicated time, HK-2 cells were
treated with CCK8 (10 μl/well; Sigma, USA) for an addi￾tional 2 h, then we recorded the absorbance at 450 nm
using a microplate absorbance reader (Tecan, Safire II,
Switzerland).
EVs-HK-2 fusion
EVs were labeled with 2 μM PKH67 (Sigma Aldrich) for
5 min. After washing, they were incubated with cultured
HK-2 cells for 24 h. Then the samples were washed and
counterstained with DAPI, followed by analyzing with
fluorescence microscopy.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from rat kidneys with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was tran￾scribed into cDNA by Superscript II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) and random primer oligonucleotides (Invi￾trogen). Real-time PCR was performed with the 7900 HT
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) for 40 cycles
with GAPDH and as an internal control. The following
primers were used in the study:
Gene name Forward primer (5′–3′) Reverse primer (5′–3′)
SK1 ATCTCCTTCACGCTGATGC GTGCAGAGACAGCAGGTTCA
SP1 AGGCACAAACGTACACACAC TGACGTTGATGCCACTGTTG
GAPDH GGGAAACTGTGGCGTGAT GAGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGA
ChIP assay
A ChIP assay was performed as described previously.
Briefly, cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde, and
chromatin was fragmented by sonication. Chromatin was
immunoprecipitated with anti-SP1 (Santa Cruz) or con￾trol IgG, and purified co-precipitated DNA was quantified
by PCR with Ex TaqTM Polymerase (TaKaRa, Otsu,
Japan). The PCR products were then analyzed using
agarose gel electrophoresis and EtBr staining for visuali￾zation. The primers used to amplify the DNA fragments
were forward 5′-GGAACCAGCTCGTGGCCCGG-3′ and
reverse 5′-GCAGCTCGTCCCAAGCTCAG-3′.
Luciferase assay
The SK1-luciferase constructs were created by inserting
an ~0.5 kb and an ~0.6 kb fragment encompassing the
predicted binding site into the pGL4-BASIC-luciferase
plasmid (Promega, Tokyo, Japan). The primers used to
amplify the DNA fragments were SP1_P1 (forward 5′-
GGAACCAGCTCGTGGCCCGG-3′ and reverse 5′-
TGCTGGGCACGAAGTTCTGG-3′) and SP1_P2 (for￾ward 5′-AGGCTCAGTGCCCTCCCCGC-3′ and reverse
5′-TGCTGGGCACGAAGTTCTGG-3′). A commercial
plasmid containing a CMV-driven Renilla reporter system
was used as an internal control (Promega). HK-2 cells
were plated in six-well plates at 50–70% confluence and
were co-transfected with the pCMV-SP1 construct or
with an equimolar amount of the empty pCMV vector
and the pGL4-SP1-P1 or pGL4-SP1-P2 construct utilizing
Lipofectamine 3000 reagents (ThermoFisher). The media
was changed 2 h prior to transfection. After the media was
changed, the cells were incubated in 10% DMEM for 24 h.
The luciferase assays were performed using the Dual￾Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the man￾ufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Briefly, 100 ml of
luciferase substrate was added to 20 ml of lysate, and
luciferase activity was measured using an LB940 Multi￾label Reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Ger￾many). Each luciferase assay was performed in triplicate.
Generation of SP1 knockout hiPSC cell lines
Firstly, a 20-bp guide sequence (5′-GGA￾GAATTAAGGCCCACTTT-3′) targeting DNA within
the third exon of SP1 was selected from a published
database of predicted high-specificity PAM target sites in
the human exome64. Two complementary oligos (5′-
CACCGGAGAATTAAGGCCCACTTT-3′ and 5′-AAA￾CAAAGTGGGCCTTAATTCTCC-3′) containing the SP1
guide sequence and BbsI ligation adapters were synthe￾sized by Genelily Biotech. One hundred micromolar of
each oligo was annealed using T4 polynucleotide kinase
(New England Biolabs) and 1 μl 10× T4 Ligation Buffer in
a total volume of 10 μl in a Bio-Rad thermal cycler. The
cycling conditions were 37 °C for 30 min, then 95 °C for 5
min, followed by a ramp to 25 °C at 5 °C/min. The
annealed oligo was ligated into the BbsI-digested pX330
vector using 5 μl of 2× QuickLigation Buffer and 1 μl of
QuickLigase (New England Biolabs). The ligation mixture
was treated with Plasmid Safe exonuclease (Epicentre)
and transformed in OneShot chemically competent Stbl3
cells (Life Technologies). After plasmid DNA extraction
(Qiagen), the sequence of the construct was verified by
automated DNA sequence analysis. Secondly, HK-2 cells
were cultured in six-well dishes to 70–80% confluence.
Cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of SP1 sgRNA plasmid
plus 1 μg of pLVX-GFP (Clontech) and 5 μl of Lipo￾fectamine 3000/well. pLVX-GFP-derived green fluor￾escent protein was used as a fluorescent marker to sort
transfected cells. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells
were pelleted in PBS + 2% FBS and sorted in 96-well
plates using FACS with a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD
BioSciences). Single cells from the population of GFP￾Yuan et al. Cell Death and Disease (2017) 8:3200 Page 15 of 18

expressing cells were expanded to obtain individual
clones. Genomic DNA was isolated from edited clones
and nonedited hiPSC cells as described above. Exon 3 of
SP1 was PCR amplified using the SP1-specific PCR pri￾mers. The PCR products were A-tailed and cloned into
pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Individually cloned amplicons
were then analyzed by Sanger sequencing. At last, positive
clones were lysed in detergent solution for 20 min at 4 °C
and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min, and 20 μg of
supernatant was fractionated on 4–20% sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
gels, transferred on to nitrocellulose, and screened by
immunoblotting with SP1 antibodies.
SK activity assay
SK activity was measured as described by Vessey et al.65.
Briefly, enzyme preparations from HK-2 cells (200 μg total
protein) were incubated in assay buffer (0.05% Triton X￾100, 250 mM KCl, 0.05 μM (3H) sphingosine (20 Ci/
mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals), 5 mM ATP,
10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM Tris pH 8.0) at 20 °C for 30 min,
in a total volume of 100 μl. Different incubation times
yielded a linear relationship with SK activity (data not
shown). Then, (3
H)S1P was extracted using 1.2 ml of
methanol:chloroform:trisodium EDTA (pH = 9) (1:2:1).
After vortexing and centrifuging for 5 min at 2700 g, the
upper aqueous phase was collected and counted in a
liquid scintillation counter (Packard BioScience, Meriden,
CT). To verify the product of our extraction, aliquots of
the upper aqueous phases were resolved on silica 60 A°
TLC plates (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) using 1-buta￾nol:methanol:acetic acid:ddH20 (80:20:10:20). The lanes
were scraped in 1-cm increments and counted in a liquid
scintillation counter. We found that the peaks from our
extraction had the same relative mobility (Rf) as purified
(
3
H) S1P (data not shown).
Measurement of (3
H) S1P synthesis in HK-2 cells
Cellular (3
H) S1P formation in HK-2 cells was measured
using a method described by Lavieu et al.66. Confluent
cells in six-well plates were cultured in serum-free media
containing 0.02 μM (3
H) sphingosine (20 Ci/mmol) over￾night to allow for equilibration. Then the media were
removed and the cells were scraped in 100 μl lysis buffer.
(
3
H) S1P was extracted from the cell lysates as described
above and counted.
Western blot
Tissues or cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer
(Solarbio, Beijing, China) containing 0.1 mM PMSF and
protease inhibitor (Roche) for 30 min on ice. Samples
were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with
the following primary antibodies: anti-Alix (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), anti-CD63 (Abcam), anti-CD81
(Abcam), anti-SK1 (Abcam), anti-SP1 (Abcam), and
anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After four
washes with PBS-Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase￾conjugated secondary antibodies were added. The sig￾nals were detected with Pierce®
ECL Western blotting
substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and developed on X￾ray films (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA).
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SEM.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Bonferroni
analysis was conducted for multiple comparisons by
GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA,
USA). p-Values <0.05 are considered statistically significant.
