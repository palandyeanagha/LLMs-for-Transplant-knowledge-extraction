Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) occurs in 5 to 8% of
kidney transplantations1 and accounts for 20 to 30% of cases
of acute rejection.2 Currently no proven treatments for AMR
exist. There are a few reports that describe the use of
plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),3 thy￾moglobulin,4 rituximab,5 proteasome inhibitors,6 or pulse
steroids in acute AMR, in varying combinations and degrees
of efficacy. In addition, there are case reports of splenectomy
followed by plasmapheresis and IVIG as rescue therapy for
acute AMR 1 week posttransplantation.7 Most of these re￾ports have focused on acute Class I human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) type AMR, which occurs immediately to up to 6 months
posttransplantation. Class I HLA is associated with better
prognosis as opposed to Class II HLA, which is characterized
as a late form of rejection, presenting at after 6 months
posttransplantation.8
Reports on the management of late Class II AMR are rare in
the literature. Here we describe the successful treatment of
two Class II AMR cases. The diagnosis was based on the
presence of allograft dysfunction, the serological demonstra￾tion of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs), and histological
confirmation of alloantibody-induced tissue dysfunction.
The first patient was successfully treated with plasmaphere￾sis, IVIG, and angioplasty and stenting of the transplanted
renal artery. The second patient was successfully treated with
IVIG and pulse steroids.
Case Reports
Case 1
GM is a 52-year-old man who underwent kidney transplan￾tation for end-stage renal disease secondary to hyperten￾sion and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His wife, who had tested
positive for DQ-7 class II HLA mismatches, provided the
living donor kidney. GM underwent plasmapheresis (one
plasma volume and 5% albumin as a replacement fluid)
before the transplantation. He tolerated the transplantation
procedure well without complication and had immediate
graft function. He returned to the hospital 7 months post￾transplantation with right lower quadrant abdominal pain
at the site of the transplanted kidney and dysuria. His
creatinine level was 3.3 mg/dL from a baseline of 2.3 mg/
dL, with a blood urea nitrogen level of 42 mg/dL. A kidney
biopsy was not performed at this time due to the patient's
concurrent coagulopathy. Based on his known DQ-7 mis￾matches he underwent three IVIG treatments and two

Abstract We are describing the successful treatment of two cases of late Class II antibody
mediated rejection status postkidney transplantation. The first patient was treated with
a combination of plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and stenting of
the transplanted renal artery. The second was treated with IVIG and pulse steroids.

sessions of plasmapheresis. For each 10% IVIG (20 g/200 mL,
Gammagard Liquid [Baxter]), he was premedicated with
100 mg intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone and 50 mg IV
diphenhydramine. The patient underwent two sessions of
plasmapheresis before and during the IVIG treatments. The
patient tolerated the treatments well.
During concurrent ultrasound of the transplanted kidney
the patient was found to have a 30 mm Hg pressure gradient
in the transplanted renal artery. A decision was made to place
a 5-mm expandable balloon endovascular stent in the trans￾planted renal artery. Placement was successful and confirmed
by angiography. The renal artery stenosis was felt to have
been caused by his AMR. HLA class II antibodies have been
shown to have antiendothelial components causing intimal
hyperplasia and inflammation leading to a form of posttrans￾plant-accelerated arteriosclerosis.9 GM was discharged with a
normalized creatinine level. Follow-up renal Doppler,
1 month after discharge demonstrated a patent transplanted
renal artery and vein with no evidence of renal artery stenosis
(►Fig. 1).
Case 2
MR is a 47-year-old woman who underwent kidney trans￾plantation secondary Focal to Segmental Glomerulosclero￾sis. The living donor kidney was provided by her friend who
was positive for the HLA class II DSA mismatch DR-17. The
patient had immediate graft function posttransplantation.
After 4 years posttransplantation, she presented with
acute rise in the creatinine level, up to 2.9 mg/dL from a
baseline of 1.5 mg/dL. It was revealed that she had
stopped her steroid regimen for personal reasons. A
biopsy was performed which revealed interstitial fibrosis,
tubular injury, and an inflammatory infiltrate of mononu￾clear Immunofluorescence microscopy showed C4d positive
cells in peritubular and glomerular capillaries. The diagno￾sis of AMR type II was made. The patient was given
two treatments of IVIG, 28.6 g (0.5 g/kg) with 250 mg
Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone). She tolerated the treat￾ments well and her creatinine returned to baseline. She was
discharged from the hospital without further incident
(►Fig. 2A, B).
Discussion
Class II HLA is a late form of rejection presenting at more than
6 months posttransplantation. This diagnosis is based clini￾cally on the presence of allograft dysfunction and the sero￾logical demonstration of DSAs. This rejection is characterized
histologically by the presence of interstitial fibrosis, tubular
atrophy, and/or arterial intimal fibrosis on light microscopy.

capillaries, as well as the presence of circumferential

Late Class II AMR is a rare form of transplant rejection
typically associated with a poor prognosis. There is scant
evidence regarding the best treatment for this presentation;
most of the literature is based on case reports and single￾center experiences. We have illustrated the successful diag￾nosis and treatment of late Class II AMR, and hope that this
data will further enhance the understanding of this compli￾cated disease process.
