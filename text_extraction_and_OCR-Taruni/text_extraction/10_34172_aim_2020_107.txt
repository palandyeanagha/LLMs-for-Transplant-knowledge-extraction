Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widespread since late December 2019, with several symptoms 
related to the upper and lower respiratory system. However, its cardiac manifestations are less frequently studied. We aimed to 
analyze the available COVID-19 data on acute cardiac injury, using troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. 
Methods: We performed a systematic review on Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases until March 25, 2020. 
Relevant records reporting the incidence of acute cardiac injury as well as troponin and BNP levels were collected from published 
peer-reviewed articles with further analysis according to the clinical status of the patients (severe, non-severe, and death).
Results: Eleven records of 1394 individuals were included. The mean age of patients with acute cardiac injury was 56.6 ± 33.4 
years (males: 54.3%). The incidence of acute cardiac injury was 15% (95% CI: 11, 20%). Further analysis revealed that dead or 
severe patients had significantly higher percentages of myocardial injury, compared to non-severe ones (peer-reviewed: 44%, 95% 
CI: 16, 74% vs. 24%, 95% CI: 15, 34% vs. 5%, 95% CI: 1, 12%, respectively). Mean total troponin was 10.23 pg/mL (95% CI: 
5.98, 14.47), while 13% (95% CI: 8%, 18%) of patients had elevated levels. Mean BNP was 216.74 pg/mL (95% CI: 3.27, 430.20).
Conclusion: Acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients is more frequent than what was expected at the beginning of the outbreak. 
Meanwhile, further studies are needed to investigate the utility of cardiac biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools for long￾term cardiac complications of this infection.

Introduction
Infections due to Coronaviridiae have led to some of the 
most widespread disasters affecting the global population 
in the 21st century.1
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome 
(MERS) are two members of this group, leading to 
hazardous epidemics in 2002 and 2012 with 10% and 37% 
mortality rates, respectively.2-5 In December 2019, several 
cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported 
in Wuhan, Hubei, China.6
 Prompt analysis of respiratory 
tract samples identified a virus with similar characteristics 
to the Coronaviridiae family with 79.5% identical genome 
to SARS; a new virulent virus which was initially named 
the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), results in SARS 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also named the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19).7-10 Since that time, more than 
3 million cases have been reported all over the world at an 
incredibly rapid rate in a way that the term “pandemic” 
was used by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
to describe it in March 2020. Clinical manifestations of 
this disease among diagnosed patients range from mild 
to severe. This disease manifests primarily with non￾specific symptoms, including fatigue, myalgia, and fever. 
However, this infection can further involve pulmonary 
tracts, causing its specific respiratory symptoms, including 
dry cough, dyspnea, or even acute respiratory distress.5,10-12
In addition to its distinctive site of infection, this highly 
contagious disease can also affect other parts of the body, 
including cardiac involvement which has been reported as 
one of its complications with different reported prevalence

rates.5,10,12,13 Therefore, implementing a meta-analysis 
with the integration of previously published studies seems 
necessary. 
We aimed to analyze the studies reporting acute cardiac 
injury as well as the alteration in cardiac biomarkers related 
to this injury, including troponin and brain natriuretic 
peptide (BNP) in patients infected with the COVID-19 
infection.
Materials and Methods
Protocol and Registration
This study has been designed in the context of Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta￾Analyses (PRISMA) statement.14 Furthermore, the current 
manuscript has been registered in the International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) 
database registry (CRD42020176685). 
Eligibility Criteria
In order to investigate acute myocardial injury and 
cardiac laboratory abnormalities [including troponin/ 
hypersensitive troponin and proBNP or N-terminal 
proBNP (NT-proBNP)] of patients confirmed with 
COVID-19 infection, we included all published peer￾reviewed case series, cross-sectional, review, cohort and 
case-control studies without any language limitations. 
We further excluded non-peer reviewed articles, animal 
studies, case reports, letters without reporting patients’ 
characteristics, or any kind of studies with incomplete 
information.
Information Source and Search Strategies
We performed a systematic review using Medline/PubMed, 
Scopus, and google scholar databases without any time 
limitations for the first two. However, articles from Jan 
1, 2020 were included in our search in the google scholar 
database. For assessment of cardiac injury, we searched the 
following terms, “acute cardiac injury”, “acute myocardial 
injury”, “acute heart injury”, “cardiac injury”, “myocardial 
injury”, “heart injury”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “coronavirus”, 
“covid-19”, “2019-nCoV” and “coronavirus covid-19”. 
The following terms in the above-mentioned databases 
were used in combination for investigating myocardial 
laboratory enzymes abnormalities, “cardiac troponin”, 
“troponin”, “c-TnI”, “troponin I”, “cardiac biomarkers”, 
“cardiac markers”, “cardiac laboratory”, “brain natriuretic 
peptide”, “BNP”, “proBNP”, “NT-proBNP”,“SARS￾CoV-2”, “coronavirus”, “covid-19”, “2019-nCoV” and 
“coronavirus covid-19”.
Data Management and Selection Process
Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of the current study 
according to our pre-defined variables, including acute 
cardiac injury, troponin, and BNP (Figure 1 A, B, and C, 
respectively). Two independent reviewers first screened 
the titles and abstracts of articles. If they were relevant, 
full texts would be obtained and assessed further based 
on inclusion and exclusion criteria. In terms of duplicate 
publications, only one was considered. In the presence of 
any terms indicating cardiac injury or myocardial enzymes, 
including troponin and BNP, the articles were selected and 
classified in their specific groups.
Data Collection Process and Data Items
Data including authors’ names, date of study, sample 
size, age (median and interquartile range (IQR) or mean 
± standard deviation,15 as reported), sex (male/female), 
myocardial complication (acute cardiac injury), laboratory 
information (including troponin/hypersensitive troponin 
and proBNP or NT-proBNP) as well as proportions 
of elevated troponin and BNP were extracted by two 
independent investigators, as appropriate. The third 
researcher assessed the probable discrepancies between 
data extraction files, and any disagreements were resolved 
by consensus. 
Risk of Bias Assessment, Data Synthesis, and Statistical 
Approach
To assess the quality of cross-sectional studies, a critical 
appraisal tool (AXIS tool) was utilized.16 In terms of 
other observational studies or systematic reviews, we used 
“strengthening the reporting of observational studies in 
epidemiology” (STROBE) or “assessment of multiple 
systematic reviews” (AMSTAR) tools, as appropriate.17,18
Both pooled results of proportions and means (MRAW: 
mean raw) with their respective 95% CIs were calculated 
using inverse-variance with the random-effects model, for 
which DerSimonian-Laird estimator was used for tau￾squared (τ2
). The statistical method suggested by Wan 
and colleagues was used for estimation of means, and SDs 
in studies reported medians and IQRs for continuous 
variables.19 Forest plots were utilized to show the impact 
of COVID-19 on acute cardiac injury and specific 
myocardial biomarkers, including troponin and BNP. All 
unit variables were converted to standard units for better 
analysis. Cochran’s Q statistic, I2, and the τ2
 were used to 
measure heterogeneity. Fixed and random-effect models 
were used according to the heterogeneity of outcomes, 
as appropriate. We further divided the study population 
based on the severity of the disease reported by each study. 
We analyzed subgroups of each pre-defined variables as 
severe group (including intensive care unit (ICU), critically 
ill, dangerous, intubated, and severe), non-severe group 
(including non-ICU, non-critical, ordinary, non-severe 
and not-intubated) and death group (including non￾survivor and expired) accordingly. All analyses were done 
using R software (version 3.6.3) meta-package (version 
4.11-0) as well as STATA (version 14), and P-values less 
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Study Selection and Characteristics
A total of 474 records were found in databases; among 
them 37 were duplicates either in one database or several. 
We further excluded 423 articles due to various reasons, 
including animal studies, non-clinical settings, or other 
study types, which we had pre-defined as exclusion 
criteria. As a result, the full-texts of 14 articles were 
retrieved with the further exclusion of seven due to the 
non-peer-reviewed status of manuscripts (Figure 1A). 
Acute cardiac injury was defined as either elevation of 
cardiac troponin above the 99th percentile of upper normal 
limit or recent electrocardiographic or echocardiographic 
abnormalities.5,12,20,21 Regarding troponin, our primary 
search revealed 250 records; 190 of them were selected 
after removal of duplicates. After exclusion of 171 more 
manuscripts, the full-texts of 19, including six peer￾reviewed articles were obtained for our further analysis 
(Figure 1B). Forty-five articles were found during the search 
on BNP levels among patients infected with COVID-19. 
After the removal of 7 duplicates and assessment of the 
other 38 records, three peer-reviewed studies were eligible 
for data extraction and analysis (Figure 1C). 
The summary characteristics and analysis of all included 
studies are shown in Tables 1 and 2. All studies were 
performed in China and had cross-sectional designs. The 
total number of patients, according to each category, was 
as follows: 970 for acute cardiac injury, 682 for troponin, 
and 678 for BNP. Risk of bias assessment of all included 
studies is shown in Table S1. 
Acute Cardiac Injury
The mean age of participants was 56.6 ± 33.4 years (males: 
54.3%). Forest plots for proportions of acute cardiac 
injury are depicted in Figure 2. Our analysis revealed that 
15% (95% CI: 11%, 20%) of individuals infected with 
COVID-19 suffered from acute cardiac injury (Figure 
2A). Further subgroup analysis showed that myocardial 
injury was less prevalent in non-severe patients than either 
the severe or the death group (5%, 95% CI: 1, 12%, vs. 
24%, 95% CI: 15%, 34%, vs. 44%, 95% CI: 16%, 74%, 
respectively) (Figure 2B). Moreover, the analysis showed 
that severe patients were at 4.74 times (95% CI: 2.30, 
9.78) higher risk of having an acute cardiac injury in 
comparison to non-severe subjects (Figure 3). 
Troponin
Patients had a mean age of 54.5 ± 15.1 years, and 56.5% of 
them were men. Forest plots, as shown in Figure 4, revealed 
that the mean high-sensitive troponin (hs-troponin) as well 
as troponin I/T among all study population was 6.81 pg/
mL (95% CI: 4.47, 9.16) and 30.49 pg/mL (95% CI: 0.84,

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in the 
literature to analyze all available data related to myocardial 
injury as well as cardiac biomarkers, including troponin 
and BNP in patients infected with this highly contagious 
virus. We included data from a total of 1394 patients from 
all included records (n = 11). We found out that cardiac 
injuries as well as myocardial biomarker abnormalities 
are quite prevalent among patients with the COVID-19 
infection. Furthermore, patients experiencing the severe 
form of this infection are most likely at higher risk of 
cardiac tissue damage. Even though COVID-19 has some 
unspecific symptoms, including cough, fever, sore throat, 
and specific presentations related to the respiratory tract, 
cardiac manifestations are becoming a new considerable 
challenge, and development of new guidelines is required 
in this regard. 
Our results showed that the frequency of acute cardiac 
injury was 15% (95% CI: 11, 20%), with higher 
percentages among dead individuals (44%, 95% CI: 16,

74%) or patients with the severe form of infection (24%, 
95% CI: 15, 34%) who required intensive care. Although 
the exact mechanism of myocardial injury remains 
unknown, several mechanisms have been proposed. The 
first one is attributed to direct invasion of the virus to the 
myocardium through blood-borne access. A prior study 
on the SARS virus reported that 35% of cardiac tissues 
from deceased patients contained the RNA genome of 
this virus.22 Furthermore, angiotensin-converting enzyme 
2 (ACE2) has been postulated as one of the primary 
receptors leading to cardiac damage.22,23 Oudit et al found 
that pulmonary infection with the human SARS virus 
in mice led to myocardial injury, which was related to 
decreased ACE2 levels.22 This target has been reported 
to be similar in the structure of binding domains with 
COVID-19.24 ACE2 is tissue-specific and expressed in 
the pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal 
cells.23 Therefore, the high resemblance of SARS with the 
COVID-19 genome, as well as similarities in receptor 
binding domains, might lead to myocardial damage. 
Pneumonia induced by this virus causes hypoxemia and 
an imbalance between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism 
favoring the latter. This phenomenon would lead to 
intracellular acidosis and production of oxygen free 
radicals as well as the influx of calcium which ultimately 
results in myocyte injury and death.23 Another probable 
mechanism could be related to the cytokine storm. The 
imbalance between T helper 1 and 2 cells leads to enormous 
production of inflammatory cytokines which might play 
roles in the pathogenesis of cardiac injury.5
 The possible 
side effects of antiviral agents, as well as development of 
the hypercoagulable state, might be other hypothetical 
mechanisms which need to be clarified.23,25
In our analysis, the mean level of total troponin was 
10.23 pg/mL (95% CI: 5.98, 14.47) and 13% (95% CI: 
8, 18%) of patients had elevated troponin levels. Besides, 
patients with severe disease had higher percentages of 
abnormal troponin ranges in comparison to individuals 
with a milder form of the disease. This biomarker has 
been suggested to be increased through several other 
mechanisms other than myocardial cell death, including 
increased cell membrane permeability or entry into 
blood of lower weight troponin fragments due to normal 
physiologic degradation.26,27 Although troponin has been 
previously suggested for the diagnosis of myocardial 
infarction due to coronary vessel obstruction, several 
other cardiac and non-cardiac disorders can also increase 
the plasma concentration of troponin.27 Thus, other 
possible secondary conditions other than injury of the 
cardiac tissue itself, must be taken into account. It has

been reported that 12%–85% of patients admitted to 
ICU showed an elevation in troponin levels, which was 
associated with poor prognosis and increased mortality 
rates.15,27,28 Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 
resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome leading 
to extra strain on the right ventricle is proposed as another 
etiology of elevated troponin.27,29,30
Moreover, this biomarker could be raised by the 
administration of mechanical ventilation, which most 
patients require in ICU settings.29 Also, sepsis could be 
categorized as another possible etiology in this regard due to 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome and its specific 
manifestations due to oxygen supply-demand imbalance 
resulting from fever, increased body metabolism, and 
respiratory failure.27,31,32 Even tachycardia, either alone or 
in the context of sepsis, might be able to raise troponin 
levels.27,33-35 It seems that the diagnosis of cardiac injury 
due to any increase in troponin must be interpreted with 
other clinical and para-clinical findings. Moreover, the 
cost-effectiveness of measurement of this marker as a 
prognostic factor must be assessed in future studies.
Our findings, in terms of BNP revealed that this 
biomarker had a mean level of 216.74 pg/mL (95% 
CI: 3.27, 430.20) and was more elevated among severe 
patients compared to individuals with the non-severe form 
of the disease. Nevertheless, due to quite small number 
of studies reporting this biomarker, interpretation of the 
results should be made with caution. Although increased 
BNP could aid in the diagnosis of heart failure, several 
other non-cardiac etiologies of this elevation should be 
considered. Advanced age, as well as anemia or renal failure, 
could elevate the level of this biomarker.36-38 Furthermore, 
right ventricle overload due to increased PVR in severe 
pulmonary diseases could partially play a role in the 
elevation of BNP.39 A diagnosis of myocardial damage 
solely based on this marker must be complemented with 
other relevant findings.
We tried our best to gather all relevant studies in this 
regard. However, several limitations may be attributed to 
this study. As COVID-19 data reporting is a daily process, 
we only analyzed appropriate studies by March 25, 2020. 
Lack of investigation of other databases including Web of 
Science or Cochrane central might have resulted in missing 
probable relevant records. However, other more common 
databases which had been checked may cover this issue.40
Inclusion of one study reporting mean BNP in patients 
with prior cardiovascular diseases, due to the availability of 
fewer studies in this regard, might have made our findings 
less conclusive for this biomarker. The risk ratio of included 
studies as well as our final analysis might be indicative 
of sparse data bias which might be due to some reasons 
including low prevalence of pre-defined variables or low 
occurrence of final event per variable.41 Moreover, we were 
not able to categorize patients based on our pre-defined 
variables to find the exact association. In other words, 
except for one study, the others did not classify patients in 
terms of presence/absence of prior cardiovascular diseases 
for better investigation of the probable effect of these 
disorders on the incidence or severity of the cardiac injury. 
Given the lack of reports on the specific method for the 
diagnosis of acute cardiac injury, we could not analyze the 
best diagnostic tool in this regard. 
In conclusion, our findings suggest that acute cardiac 
injury is quite common among patients with COVID-19; 
however, further investigation is required in this regard. 
Moreover, measurement of specific cardiac biomarkers 
as prognostic factors, especially among severe patients, 
must be verified by future studies. Likewise, long￾term assessment of this virus could help us with better 
recognition of probable chronic cardiac complications.
