Abstract
Background: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) are recognized as strong risk factors of
vascular calcifications in non dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the
relationships between FGF23, OPG, and coronary artery calcifications (CAC) in this population and to attempt identification
of the most powerful biomarker of CAC: FGF23? OPG?
Methodology/Principal Findings: 195 ND-CKD patients (112 males/83 females, 70.8 [27.4–94.6] years) were enrolled in this
cross-sectional study. All underwent chest multidetector computed tomography for CAC scoring. Vascular risk markers
including FGF23 and OPG were measured. Logistic regression analyses were used to study the potential relationships
between CAC and these markers. The fully adjusted-univariate analysis clearly showed high OPG ($10.71 pmol/L) as the
only variable significantly associated with moderate CAC ([100–400[) (OR = 2.73 [1.03;7.26]; p = 0.04). Such association failed
to persist for CAC scoring higher than 400. Indeed, severe CAC was only associated with high phosphate fractional excretion
(FEPO4) ($38.71%) (OR = 5.47 [1.76;17.0]; p = 0.003) and high FGF23 ($173.30 RU/mL) (OR = 5.40 [1.91;15.3]; p = 0.002). In
addition, the risk to present severe CAC when FGF23 level was high was not significantly different when OPG was normal or
high. Conversely, the risk to present moderate CAC when OPG level was high was not significantly different when FGF23
was normal or high.
Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that OPG is associated to moderate CAC while FGF23 rather represents a
biomarker of severe CAC in ND-CKD patients.

Introduction
Coronary artery calcifications (CAC) are recognized as a strong
predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis
(HD) patients [1]. Recent studies now provide strong evidence for
the risk of death with a high CAC score in chronic kidney disease
(CKD) patients before onset of dialysis [2,3]. Presence of CAC has
been associated with numerous traditional risk factors including
aging, hypertension and diabetes as well as with non traditional
risk factors including mineral metabolism disorders, hyperpara￾thyroidism, inflammation, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and more
recently fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) [4].
OPG is a bone regulating protein belonging to the TNF
receptor superfamily. With its ligand, the receptor activator of
nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL), it regulates important aspects
of osteoclast/osteoblast formation [5]. RANKL increases the pool
of active osteoclasts by activating its specific receptor RANK
located partly on osteoclastic cells, thus increasing bone resorption,
whereas OPG, which neutralizes RANKL, has opposite effects.
RANKL and OPG are produced by bone marrow derived stromal
cells and osteoblasts and are regulated by various calcitropic
cytokines, hormones, and drugs. The actions of OPG and
RANKL in the vasculature and heart are still unclear but no
doubt exists about the strong association of OPG with the
prevalence of vascular calcifications in predialysis [6] and HD
patients [7].
FGF23 is the main regulator of phosphate homeostasis. It is
produced by osteocytes in response to hyperphosphatemia and
exerts its effects on its receptor, the Klotho-FGFR1c heterodimer,
in the kidney where it inhibits the expression of Na-Pi

cotransporters resulting in hyperphosphaturia. Literature data are
more controversial regarding FGF23 association with vascular
calcifications according to the stage of CKD. Relationships
between FGF23 and aortic calcifications [8] or peripheral vascular
calcifications [9,10] are well documented in HD patients. By
contrast, studies in non dialysis CKD (ND-CKD) patients could
not evidence any association after multivariable adjustment [11]
but rather relationships to atherosclerosis [12] and left ventricular
hypertrophy [11,13].
We therefore investigated in this cross-sectional study the
relationships between FGF23, OPG and CAC prevalence in a
population of ND-CKD patients and attempted to identify the
most powerful biomarker(s) of CAC: FGF23? OPG?
Methods
Ethics Statement
The study was conducted according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with International
Conference on Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice regula￾tions. According to the French Law, the study has been registered
at ‘‘Ministe`re de la Sante´ et des Solidarite´s’’ after approval by the
Montpellier University Hospital’s ethics committee (Comite´ de
Protection des Personnes Sud Me´diterrane´e IV) with the following
number 2006-A00416-45. All patients gave their written informed
consent.
Subjects
One hundred and ninety five ND-CKD patients at various
stages of kidney disease, issued from the outpatient general
nephrology consultation of the Montpellier Lapeyronie university
hospital, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Inclusion
criteria were age$18 years and presence of CKD defined by
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in agreement with the National
Kidney Foundation [14].
Causes of CKD were glomerulonephritis (n = 25), cystic renal
disease (n = 14), diabetic nephropathy (n = 21), diabetic and
hypertensive nephropathy (n = 21), angiosclerosis and hypertensive
nephropathy (n = 79), infectious/obstructive interstitial nephropa￾thy (n = 4), renal neoplasia (n = 1), genetic/congenital cause
(n = 1), necrotizing angiitis (n = 3), unknown cause (n = 9), other
cause (n = 17).
Detailed medical history including age, gender, weight, height,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, past or current smoking, presence
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was recorded.
Existence of hypertension was defined by brachial blood
pressure higher or equal to 130/80 mmHg and/or by a current
antihypertensive treatment.
Presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was defined
by the presence of at least one of the three following manifesta￾tions: coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease
(CVD) or peripheral vascular disease (PVD). CHD was defined as
documented angina pectoris or history of myocardial infarction.
Angina pectoris was described as chest pain arising at exertion and
disappearing with nitroglycerine or rest. The diagnosis may also
have been made by a positive evaluation in nuclear medicine or a
coronary stenosis .75% of luminal diameter evidenced by
angiography. Myocardial infarction was defined as clinical
symptoms, such as chest pain or dyspnea, associated with
abnormal electrocardiogram and elevated troponins. CVD was
defined as previous clinical cerebral disease (transient ischemic
attack or stroke) or the presence of atheromatous plaques on
internal carotid arteries. PVD included clinical symptoms such as
intermittent claudication, abolished peripheral pulses or dimin￾ished arterial pulses or signs of atheromatous involvement of the
lower limb diagnosticated by doppler ultrasound.
Procedures
Laboratory measurements. Blood samples were collected
as part of our regular CKD patient follow-up, centrifuged and
supernatant was stored at 280uC for processing of creatinine,
calcium, PO4, 25(OH) vitamin D, 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D, intact
parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin, high sensitive C reactive
protein (hs CRP), fibrinogen, FGF23 and OPG. All measurements
were sequentially done with less than one year intervals after
freezing.
Creatinine was measured by enzymatic method (Olympus,
Rungis, France) using reagents from Randox (Randox, Mauguio,
France). Calcium and PO4 were assessed by colorimetric method
(Olympus, Rungis, France). 25(OH) vitamin D and 1.25(OH)2
vitamin D were measured by radioimmunoassay (Immunodiag￾nostic Systems, Boldon, UK). Intact PTH and insulin were
measured by immunoradiometric assay (N-Tact PTH SP IRMA
Kit, DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA; Bi Ins IRMA, Cisbio
International, Bagnols sur Ce`ze, France). Albumin was measured
by immunonephelometry (Immage Beckman Coulter, Villepinte,
France). hs CRP was determined by immunoturbidimetry
(Olympus, Rungis, France). Fibrinogen was measured by Von
Clauss method (STA Fibrinogen, Diagnostica Stago, Asnie`res,
France). FGF23 was measured with an enzyme linked immuno￾sorbent assay (ELISA) detecting both intact FGF23 and C￾terminal fragments (Immutopics International Inc, San Clemente;
CA, USA). OPG was determined by ELISA (Biovendor Labora￾tory Medicine, Brno, Czech Republic) [15,16].
GFR was estimated using the reexpressed 4-variable Modifica￾tion of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation [17].
Urinary PO4 excretion was expressed as Fractional excretion of
PO4 (FEPO4) calculated as follows: FEPO4 (%) = urine[PO4]6
plasma[Creat]6100/urine[Creat]6plasma[PO4].
Coronary artery calcification imaging. All patients un￾derwent multidetector computed tomography (MDCT).
Regarding data acquisition, all MDCT scans derived from a
multidetector-row spiral CT (Lightspeed VCT, General Electric
Medical System, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Prospective ECG￾triggered step-scan was performed using with 2.5-mm collimation
width 664 detectors so that the center of the temporal window
corresponded to 70% of the R-R interval. The scanning
parameters were a gantry rotation speed of 0.35 s/rotation,
120 kV and 300 mA 862.5 collimation, and 20 mm table feed per
rotation. The matrix size was 5126512 pixels and the display field
of view was 25 cm. The reconstruction kernel was standard. The
temporal resolution was 250 ms.
Regarding image evaluation, calcium score was calculated using
a semi-automatically software (Smartscore version 3.5, Advantage
Window 4.4 workstation, General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA).
Coronary calcification was defined as a plaque of . = 4 pixels
(area = 1.37 mm2
) with a density of greater than or equal to 130
Hounsfield units. Quantitative calcium scores were calculated
according to the method described by Agatston et al. [18].
Coronary calcium scoring was performed by either a physician or
computed tomography technician with specific training for the
methodology described above.
Statistical Methods
Characteristics of the population were described by using
proportions for categorical variables and median and range for
quantitative variables since their distributions were tested with the
Shapiro-Wilk statistic and were mostly skewed.
Bone Markers and Severity of CAC in CKD Patients
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e36175

Associations between the extent of CAC divided into three
groups (,100, [100–400[, $400) and patient characteristics,
vascular risk biomarkers, biological parameters were quantified
with odds-ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Clinical and sociodemographic variables associated with CAC (at
p,0.15) were included in multinomial logistic regression models to
estimate adjusted OR for biological parameters (especially OPG
and FGF23). The cut-off used for CAC has been chosen by respect
to CAC scoring: those with CAC,100 (considered as patients with
insignificant or mild CAC), those with CAC in the range [100–
400[ (presence of moderate CAC) and those with CAC$400
(presence of severe CAC) [19,20]. Biological parameters were
divided into tertiles. In the case of FGF23 and OPG, patients were
divided into two categories, those with a low level (,173.30 RU/
mL for FGF23; ,10.71 pmol/L for OPG, corresponding to the
1st and 2nd tertiles) and those with a high level ($173.30 RU/mL
for FGF23; $10.71 pmol/L for OPG, corresponding to the 3rd
tertile).
Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) was used to determine
the relationships between quantitative variables.
Significance was set at p,0.05. All analyses were carried
out with SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA).
Results
Clinical characteristics for the 195 CKD patients are summa￾rized in Table 1.
Sex ratio of the patients was 112/83 (male/female), median age
was 70.8 with a range of 27.4–94.6 years and median BMI was
26.7 [14.3–47.7] kg/m2
.
Ninety five (49.0%) patients had ever smoked. Diabetes and
hypertension were found in 63 (32.3%) and 180 (92.3%) patients
respectively. History of CHD was present in 39 patients (20.0%),
14 (7.2%) patients had history of CVD and 34 (17.4%) had history
of PVD.
One hundred and twenty four (63.6%) patients were receiving
vitamin D supplements, 64 (37.2%) patients were receiving statins,
12 (7.0%) patients were receiving sevelamer HCl, none of them
were receiving cinacalcet. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents were
administered to 37 (18.97%) patients.
Median eGFR using MDRD was 33.2 [6.5–91.9] mL/min/
1.73 m2
. Median hs CRP was 2.2 [0.1;56.1] mg/L, median intact
PTH was 47.0 [4.0–493.0] pg/mL, median 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D
was 30 [5–80] pg/mL, median 25(OH) vitamin D was 19.5 [6.6–
76.4] ng/mL, median FGF23 was 126.4 [42.9–3415.0] RU/mL
and median OPG level was 9.1 [2.7–37.6] pmol/L.
Median CAC was 188 [0–3942].
Stratification of FGF23 and OPG median values (quartiles)
according to CKD stages are presented in Figure 1.
Characteristics of the patients according to the level of
CAC
Among the 195 patients studied, 79 (40.5%) had insignificant or
mild CAC (score below 100), 50 (25.6%) patients had moderate
CAC (score in the range [100–400[) and 66 (33.9%) presented
severe CAC (score greater than or equal to 400).
The univariate analysis revealed that presence of moderate
CAC (score in the range [100–400[) was significantly associated
with male gender (OR = 3.17 [1.51;6.65]); age (OR = 2.75
[1.83;4.13] for 10 years increased) and diabetes (OR = 4.48
[1.91;10.5]). Presence of severe CAC (score greater or equal to
400) was significantly associated with the same parameters (male
gender: OR = 4.71 [2.30;9.62]; age: OR = 3.04 [2.04;4.51] for 10
years increased; diabetes: OR = 6.08 [2.64;14.0]) including smok￾ing (OR = 3.11 [1.57;6.16]). No significant relationship between
therapeutic interventions and moderate or severe CAC was
evidenced (Table 2).
Relationships between biological markers of vascular risk
and the extent of CAC
Among the biological markers of vascular risk studied, the
logistic regression analysis clearly showed high OPG
($10.71 pmol/L) as the only one variable to be significantly
associated with moderate CAC ([100–400[) (OR = 2.73
[1.03;7.26]; p = 0.04) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes

and smoking. Such association failed to persist for CAC scoring
higher than 400 (OR = 2.41 [0.91;6.39]). Indeed, severe CAC
score was only associated with high FEPO4 ($38.71%) (OR = 5.47
[1.76;17.0]; p = 0.003) and high FGF23 ($173.30 RU/mL)
(OR = 5.40 [1.91;15.3]; p = 0.002) (Table 3). Besides, a strong
positive correlation was observed between FEPO4 and FGF23
whatever the CAC score was (all CAC: rho = 0.53, p,0.0001;
CAC,100: rho = 0.45, p,0.0001; CAC [100–400[: rho = 0.51,
p = 0.0003; CAC$400: rho = 0.61, p,0.0001).
Prevalence of high OPG and FGF-23 levels according to
the extent of CAC
To further compare the relative prevalence of abnormally high
(greater than the lower bound of third tertile) OPG versus FGF23
levels across the spectrum of CAC, the proportions of participants
with normal or high OPG and FGF23 values within each category
of CAC were determined. (Figure 2A). As expected, the
predominant pattern in the range of insignificant or mild CAC
(,100) was normal FGF23/normal OPG (63.3%). In the range of
moderate CAC, an isolated increase in OPG (46.0%) was the most
common pattern and was more likely than an isolated increase in
FGF23 (28.0%). By contrast, at the level of severe CAC, the most
common pattern was characterized by an isolated increase in
FGF23 (47.0%).
Relationships between OPG/FGF23 (as a composite
criterium) and the extent of CAC
Logistic regression model clearly showed that, in these patients,
the risk to present severe CAC when FGF23 level was high
($173.30 RU/mL) was not significantly different when OPG
was normal (OR = 7.33 [2.02;26.60]) or high (OR = 7.34
[1.63;33.00]). Conversely, even though only a tendancy exists,

the risk to present moderate CAC when OPG level was high
($10.71 pmol/L) was not significantly different when FGF23
was normal (OR = 3.27 [0.99;10.80]) or high (OR = 3.53
[0.77;16.30]) (Figure 2B).
Discussion
In this study, clinical variables such as age, diabetes mellitus and
smoking habits were associated with CAC in our population of
ND-CKD patients. Among biomarkers of vascular calcifications,
our results clearly confirmed that both high OPG and FGF23

associated to moderate CAC while FGF23 rather represents a
biomarker of severe CAC in these patients.
Previous studies have reported an association between high OPG
levels and CAC in CKD (in particular one from our group) [6], HD
[7,10,21] and diabetic patients [22,23]. Here, we demonstrated for
the first time that high OPG is only associated to moderate rather
than severe coronary calcifications. These interesting results are in
total agreement with a previous study from Morony et al. [24] in a
model of atherogenic diet-fed ldlr (2/2) mice. Indeed, the authors
clearly showed that plasma OPG level increased with initiation of
the atherogenic diet, reached a maximum value after one month of
diet and did not increase further during the four following months
while aortic atherosclerosis lesions were still progressing. In our

study, the same pattern is observed. OPG values are significantly
increased in patients with moderate ([100–400[) compared with
mild (,100) CAC, this increased level being comparable with that
of patients presenting severe (.400) CAC. This clearly suggests that
OPG appears as a marker of atherosclerosis/vascular calcification
onset rather than its severity or progression. Considerable
controversy exists regarding the role of OPG in the development
and progression of vascular calcifications. However, the only theory
we can speculate on is that OPG is increased in response to vascular
insult as the component of a complex compensatory mechanism,
probably secondary to inflammatory processes. Indeed, proinflam￾matory mediators, particularly TNF-alpha, which participate to the
development of vascular calcification through induction of alkaline
phosphatase can also stimulate OPG synthesis in vascular smooth
muscle cells and endothelial cells [25–27] in an attempt to possibly
counteract osteogenic or pro-apoptotic calcification mechanisms.
However, further in vitro and in vivo studies need to be conducted
in order to elucidate the exact implication of such molecule in the
early progression of vascular calcifications.
Regarding FGF23, although its association with CAC was
evidenced in HD [8,9], this relationship was not clear in all studies
related to ND-CKD patients. In their analysis, Gutierrez et al.
[11] could describe an association between FGF23 and CAC.
However, this association was no longer significant after multi￾variable adjustment or when examined on a continuous scale. The
recent study from Desjardins et al. [28] clearly demonstrated in
142 ND-CKD patients an association between high FGF23 and
aortic calcifications and to a lesser extent an association with CAC
in a subgroup of 93 patients. As previously observed by Gutierrez
et al., FGF23 was also no longer associated to CAC in their
multivariate analysis. The authors speculated that, contrary to
aortic calcifications, the lack of association between CAC and
FGF23 may be explained by the different type of calcifications
observed (intimal for coronaries and medial in the case of aorta):
FGF23 being more related to mineral metabolism disturbances,
would favor medial rather than intimal atheromatous calcifica￾tions. Actually, the persisting association between CAC and
FGF23 after full adjustment, observed here, in more than twice the
number of patients, may probably reflect a power limitation of
their study. Desjardins et al. also depicted correlations between
aortic as well as coronary calcifications and FGF23. In the present
study, we were not able to evidence any correlation, as our results
clearly demonstrated an association between FGF23 and severe
rather than moderate CAC. Interestingly, these latter findings
were also described in the study from Jean et al. in HD patients
[10].
The potential evidence of high FGF23 as a biomarker of severe
CAC in our study cannot lead to the conclusion of a real role of
FGF23 in the pathogenesis of CAC. Indeed, it was initially
postulated that FGF23, due to its phosphaturic and hypophos￾phatemic actions [29], may be considered as a protective molecule
against vascular calcifications. During decline in renal function,

the commonly observed rise in FGF23 should probably reflect an
increased production by osteocytes to help maintening normopho￾sphatemia rather than a lack of removal by the kidney [30].
However, a previous work in this population could report a
preponderance of C-terminal fragments (secondary to proteolytic
cleavage of intact FGF23) suggesting that less than one-quarter of
the circulating FGF23 was bioactive in these patients [31]. In
addition, the original work from Goetz et al. [32] could provide
evidence that proteolytic cleavage of this molecule abrogated its
activity by removing FGF23’s binding site for the FGF receptor￾Klotho complex and also by generating an endogenous inhibitor
of FGF23. Therefore, taken into account all these findings, it could
be postulated that the high levels of FGF-23 (both intact and C￾terminal fragments) measured in our population might reflect a
lack of efficiency rather than an excess activity of this
phosphatonin. However, importantly we observed a significant
association between high levels of FEPO4, the first target of
FGF23, and CAC. Finally, as no association was reported between
phosphatemia and CAC in our study, we may also assume that
such association between FGF23 and CAC involves phosphate￾independent mechanismes. Indeed, the recent report of Faul et al.
[33] in an animal model strongly suggests that FGF-23 per se is able
to induce an impairment in cardiac function. Besides, the lack of
association observed here between serum phosphate and CAC is
surprising but not unexpected as previous studies also reported
similar findings in predialysis patients [2,34]. Russo et al. suggested
that a single measurement of serum phosphate could not reflect
the lifetime exposure due to rapidly changes over time for
compensatory mechanisms that are mostly active early in the
course of CKD [35].
Our study acknowledged some limitations. Both intact FGF23
and C-terminal fragments have been measured here. Even though
several studies reported strong correlations (r = 0.97; p,0.0001)
existing with the active intact FGF23 [36], this assay does not
exactly reflect the biologically active form of FGF23. However, it is
to note that a strong positive correlation (rho = 0.52731;
p,0.0001) was observed here between C-terminal fragments
and FEPO4, the intact FGF23 first target. Circulating klotho levels
are missing due to the lack of availability of assays in plasma or
urine. The relatively small sample size of this study may have
prevented some of the detected associations from being statistically
significant. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of this study can not
clearly evidence the kinetic of OPG and FGF23 over the
progression of coronary calcifications, a prospective study being
strongly required.
In conclusion, even though both OPG and FGF23 constitute
strong predictors of mortality in HD patients, their relationships to
vascular calcifications are different, especially in ND-CKD
population. Our results clearly showed that both high OPG and
FGF23 levels were associated with CAC in this population of ND￾CKD patients, OPG being nevertheless a stronger associated
factor of moderate CAC while FGF23 rather represents a
biomarker of severe CAC.
