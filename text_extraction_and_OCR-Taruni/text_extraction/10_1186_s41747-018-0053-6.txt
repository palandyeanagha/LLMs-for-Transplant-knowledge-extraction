Abstract
Background: Although splenectomy is considered the preferred treatment for hypersplenism, intraoperative blood
loss remains a common occurrence. We prospectively compared the perioperative and clinical outcome of splenic
artery embolisation (SAE) before open splenectomy (OS) versus OS alone in two concurrent patient groups.
Methods: From January 2016 to January 2018, 50 patients with hypersplenism underwent combined SAE and OS
(study group). For comparison, we considered 50 age- and gender-matched case controls undergoing OS without
prior SAE during the same period (control group). Perioperative and clinical outcomes were compared between the
two groups. Mann–Whitney U test, Student’s t-test, χ
2 or Fisher’s exact test were used as appropriate.
Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups for age, gender and laboratory
investigations (p ≥ 0.250). Mortality rate was zero in both groups. No patients of the study group needed
perioperative blood transfusion in comparison with patients of the control group (p = 0.003). A significant
increase in platelet count was noted in the study group after SAE compared to the control group (p = 0.024). No
significant differences between the two groups were observed for operating time, postoperative complications and
postoperative stay (p ≥ 0.237).
Conclusion: We confirm that preoperative SAE in patients who undergo splenectomy for hypersplenism significantly
reduces the need for blood transfusion in comparison to splenectomy without prior embolisation. Preoperative SAE is
a safe procedure with neither morbidity nor mortality.

Background
Hypersplenism occurs due to hyperactivity of the spleen and
defined as a triad of splenomegaly, pancytopenia and nor￾mocellularity of bone marrow [1–3]. Surgical splenectomy
is a traditional treatment for hypersplenism; however,
splenectomy is associated with significant postoperative
complications [4]. Splenic artery embolisation (SAE) has
been widely used as an alternative to splenectomy for the
treatment of hypersplenism because it is minimally inva￾sive and associated with fewer complications [5–8].
Preoperative SAE makes splenectomy a safer proced￾ure by reducing the intraoperative blood loss and the
need for blood transfusion [9]. SAE before splenectomy
improves the platelet count, reduces the size of the
spleen and makes it softer [10, 11].

Several reports in the literature have investigated the
role of SAE before splenectomy. We reported herein a
combined treatment approach to splenomegaly due to
hypersplenism consisting of preoperative SAE performed
by an interventional radiologist and open splenectomy
(OS) performed by a general surgeon with 6–8 h be￾tween the two procedures. The purpose of this study
was to evaluate the clinical outcome of this combined
treatment approach in the management of hypersplen￾ism and compared with OS alone.
Methods
Study design
We performed a prospective observational study in two
concurrent groups of patients receiving or not receiving
SAE before OS.
Ethical considerations
The present study was approved by the institutional re￾view board. The risk and potential benefits of the proce￾dures were explained to all patients and a written
informed consent was obtained. The study was per￾formed in accordance with the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Study population
This study was conducted on 50 consecutive patients ad￾mitted to the Surgical Department of the Zagazig
University Hospital Zagazig, Egypt, from January 2016 to
January 2018 with clinically and laboratory proven hypers￾plenism (mean platelet count < 40,000 u/μL). All patients of
the study group underwent a combined treatment including
SAE before OS. For the purpose of study comparison,
we selected another 50 patients out of 197 patients
(25.4%) admitted to the same Surgical Department dur￾ing the same period who underwent OS without prior
SAE (control group). The patients of the control group
were selected to be age- and gender-matched to those in
the study group (for each patient of the study group, we
selected the first one with the same gender and with an
age included in an interval of ± 2.5 years compared with
that of the patient of the study group). The patients in the
control group underwent OS alone without prior SAE
based on the surgeon’s decision, the choice of patients
or they were individuals with known allergy to iodined
contrast agent. Patients with hypocellular or infiltrative
bone marrow disease, ischemic heart disease, renal fail￾ure or malignant disease and those with advanced liver
disease were excluded from the study.
Patient assessment
On admission, all patients were subjected to a detailed
history, thorough clinical examination, laboratory and
biochemical investigations (including bone marrow as￾piration), abdominal ultrasonography and color-coded
duplex scanning of the portal circulation. For each
patient, splenic volume was measured twice using
ultrasound, before SAE and just before OS.
Ultrasound measurement of the spleen volume was
performed according to the following protocol: ultra￾sound was performed using an S40 Exp/S40 Pro/S40/
S35 Digital Color Doppler US system with a 3.5/
5-MHz convex transducer probe. Spleen metrics were
assessed by using defined standard algorithms [12].
With the patient in the supine position, the examin￾ation started in the posterior axillary line in the ap￾proximate area of the tenth rib through an intercostal
space to identify the longitudinal view of the spleen
with the hilum. In this position, maximum length and
width were measured. Respiratory manoeuvres some￾times helped improve the visibility of the spleen.
Turning the probe over the hilum by 90° from the
plane of maximal spleen length provided the trans￾verse image to measure the spleen anteroposterior dimen￾sion [13]. The haematological assessment, including
platelet count, was done preoperatively just before the
OS and on day 10 after surgery. A strict protocol of
prophylactic parenteral therapy was followed, with a
ten-day course of intravenous injection of 1000 mg
cefazoline at an interval of 6 h (three days before
SAE and seven days after OS). All patients received
pneumococcal vaccination before the procedure.
Patient demographics are listed in Table 1.
Splenic artery embolisation
The SAE procedure was performed 6–8 h before OS by
an interventional radiologist with ten years of experience
in SAE using the following technique: the femoral ar￾tery was punctured and a 5-F introducer sheath was
placed; the splenic artery was catheterised under fluoros￾copy using a 4- or 5-F cobra catheter (Imager, Boston
Scientific, USA). We used a microcatheter (Renegade
HI-FLO microcatheter, Boston Scientific, USA) in five pa￾tients with a tortuous splenic artery. The microcath￾eter was advanced through the cobra catheter till the
splenic hilum. After securing the left gastroepiploic ar￾tery to preserve distal pancreatic branches of the splenic
artery, infusion of polyvinyl alcohol particles (300–355 μm
in diameter) (Contour Emboli, Boston Scientific Cork
Ltd., Ireland) mixed with 25 mL of iodinated contrast
and one ampule of gentamycin (80 mg) was done.
The embolisation procedure was considered satisfactory
when at least 60–70% of the parenchymal vascularity ap￾peared as occluded at subjective assessment (Fig. 1). The
procedure was performed using an angiography unit
(Cath Lab System, Siemens, Artis Zee Ceiling VC21C).
The average duration of the procedure was 20 min.

Open splenectomy
The OS was performed by three surgeons with more
than ten years of experience. An upper midline incision
was done. Upon entry into the abdominal cavity, dissec￾tion was performed with the blunt and sharp technique.
The surgeon’s hand followed the convex surface of the
organ and identified the peritoneal attachments. The spleen
was gently grasped and displaced medially toward the
incision. The avascular peritoneal attachments and liga￾ments were incised, but in patients with portal hyperten￾sion, any ligaments were ligated. At the hilum, the
splenic artery and veins were identified, carefully
dissected, doubly ligated with 0 silk, and transfixed by
2–0 silk suture ligatures. To avoid injury to the

pancreas, the dissection was carried out at the hilum
in close proximity to the spleen. Next, the short gas￾tric vessels were identified and ligated. After removal of
the spleen, haemostasis was obtained and confirmed in a
systematic fashion through careful inspection of the left
sub-phrenic area, the greater curvature of the stomach
and the short gastric vessel area, as well as the splenic
hilum. Inspection of these areas was facilitated by proper
retraction of the stomach and small bowel to allow clear
visualisation of the left upper quadrant and surgical
beds. Attention was then turned to the surgical field to
check for active bleeding. When active bleeding was
identified, we achieved haemostasis. Drains were not
routinely used, except in cases where an injury of the tail
of the pancreas was suspected or confirmed. The ab￾dominal incision was closed by approximating the linea
alba using 1–0 polypropylene monofilament sutures in a
continuous fashion. The skin was closed with staples.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v16.0
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Baseline clinical and labora￾tory data that might determine different postoperative out￾comes were compared between the two groups.
Categorical variables were presented as frequencies.
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation or median and interquartile range (IQR) accord￾ing to their normal or non-normal distribution, respect￾ively. Mann–Whitney U test, Student’s t-test, χ2 or Fisher’s
exact test were used as appropriate. A p value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
We did not find significant differences between the two
groups for age, gender and laboratory investigations (see
Table 1).
Perioperative details are given in Table 2. After a
6–8 h interval between SAE and OS, 72% of patients
in our study showed reduced splenic volume. A sig￾nificant difference was observed between the two
groups concerning the perioperative increase in the
platelet count. A significant difference was detected
between the two groups concerning the perioperative
need for blood transfusion; there was no need for
blood transfusion in the study group while 45/50
(90%) of controls received blood transfusion.
Minor postoperative complications occurred in the two
groups (Table 3). Portal vein thrombosis was identified in
two patients of the study group, one month after surgery.
The mortality rate was zero in both groups.
Discussion
Surgical splenectomy has been performed since 1950 for
hypersplenism caused by portal hypertension. Portal
hypertension, complicated by gastrointestinal haemor￾rhage, has become one of the principal indications for
splenectomy [14, 15]. However, the risk of intraoperative
blood loss and haemorrhagic complications associated
with splenectomy in patients with portal hypertension
has been recognised in many series [16, 17]. Poulin et al.
[18] and Fujitani et al. [19] suggested the possibility of
reducing the incidence of intraoperative bleeding by per￾forming preoperative SAE.
The value of preoperative SAE observed in our study
for a better control of intraoperative blood loss during
splenectomy confirms the results of previously pub￾lished studies in the management of patients with
hypersplenism [10, 11], as there was no need for blood
transfusion in the SAE patient group. In 2007, Bau et
al. [10] reported on a patient series without preopera￾tive SAE. They had severe haemorrhagic complications
that required transfusions of platelets in 65% of cases
and of red blood cells in 47%, while there was no need
for blood transfusion in their preoperative SAE group.
In 2012, Wu et al. [11] reported that only 10% of the
SAE patient group needed blood transfusion, compared
to 30% in the group of laparoscopic splenectomy with￾out preoperative SAE and 52% in the group who under￾went OS splenectomy without preoperative SAE.

Of note, Iwase et al. [20] mentioned a significant dif￾ference in favour of SAE patient group concerning the
perioperative increase in the platelet count, attributing
this to the reduction of splenic function. In our study,
there was an overall improvement in the platelet count
after embolisation in the SAE patient group (mean
380,000 U/ μL, on day 10 post surgery). This finding
provides a better evidence on the effect of the SAE and
confirms other many older series [5, 10, 11, 21]. SAE
leads to a softer and smaller spleen, improves the surgi￾cal view and reduces the incidence of bleeding [11, 22].
There is no consensus in the literature about the opti￾mal time interval between the SAE and the splenectomy.
The time interval was in the range of 2 h to one day in
the published studies. Wu et al. [11] showed that it is ef￾fective to increase the interval between embolisation and
surgery to reduce splenic volume. An interval of 2.8–
4.8 h between SAE and laparoscopic splenectomy was
sufficient to reduce the splenic volume in 80% of pa￾tients in their series. In our study, 72% of patients in our
study showed reduced splenic volume after a 6–8 h
interval between SAE and OS.
In our opinion, perioperative SAE makes splenectomy
safer. Even though many studies of pre- or perioperative
SAE showed good results, the technique has yet to be￾come widespread. This may be partly due to the fact that
complications secondary to the injection of microparticles
have been described [11, 23, 24]. Regarding the two cases
of portal vein thrombosis, they did not complain of any
discomfort. Low-molecular-weight heparin was used to
prevent thrombopoiesis and a regular colour Doppler
ultrasound was performed three months after OS.
Our study has an important limitation. Cases were se￾lected for preoperative SAE or direct splenectomy de￾pending on the surgeon’s opinion and/or the patient’s
preference rather than being based on objective guide￾lines or being randomised. This may have led to
treatment bias. However, the characteristics of the two
groups were quite similar as shown in Table 1.
In conclusion, we confirm that preoperative SAE in
patients who undergo splenectomy for hypersplenism
significantly reduces blood transfusion in comparison to
splenectomy without prior embolisation.
