TLR4 is the receptor for LPS and plays a critical role in innate immunity. Stimulation of TLR4 activates pro￾inflammatory pathways and induces cytokine expression in a variety of cell types. Inflammatory pathways
are activated in tissues of obese animals and humans and play an important role in obesity-associated insulin
resistance. Here we show that nutritional fatty acids, whose circulating levels are often increased in obesity,
activate TLR4 signaling in adipocytes and macrophages and that the capacity of fatty acids to induce inflam￾matory signaling in adipose cells or tissue and macrophages is blunted in the absence of TLR4. Moreover, mice
lacking TLR4 are substantially protected from the ability of systemic lipid infusion to (a) suppress insulin
signaling in muscle and (b) reduce insulin-mediated changes in systemic glucose metabolism. Finally, female
C57BL/6 mice lacking TLR4 have increased obesity but are partially protected against high fat diet–induced
insulin resistance, possibly due to reduced inflammatory gene expression in liver and fat. Taken together,
these data suggestthat TLR4 is a molecular link among nutrition, lipids, and inflammation and thatthe innate
immune system participates in the regulation of energy balance and insulin resistance in response to changes
in the nutritional environment.
Introduction
Obesity is the most important identified factor contributing to
insulin resistance (1, 2). The physiological mechanisms linking
obesity to insulin resistance have received intense investigation
and include altered production of various adipocyte-derived
molecules, among which are the adipokines adiponectin and
resistin, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6,
RBP4, and FFAs themselves (1–7). It is increasingly recognized
that obesity is characterized by chronic activation of inflam￾matory pathways and that inflammatory signaling pathways in
obesity are causally linked to insulin resistance (1, 2, 7). How￾ever, the fundamental mechanisms responsible for activating
inflammatory pathways in obesity are poorly understood. FFAs,
levels of which are elevated in obesity, due to increased release
from expanded adipose tissue, have been hypothesized to cause
insulin resistance. Indeed, FFA infusion in vivo has been shown
to impair the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose pro￾duction and to stimulate glucose uptake into skeletal muscle
(8–10), which in turn leads to insulin resistance. Potential
intracellular mechanisms whereby FFAs cause insulin resistance
have been explored, and a role for several inflammatory signal￾ing networks has emerged. For instance, intracellular kinases
linked to inflammatory signaling, including PKC-θ, IKKα, and
JNK appear to play roles in fatty acid–induced insulin resistance,
since PKC-θ–, IKKα- and JNK-knockout mice are substantially
protected from FFA-induced insulin resistance (11–14). Howev￾er, while fatty acid–induced insulin resistance appears to involve
activation of intracellular inflammatory signaling pathways, the
primary molecular mechanisms whereby FFAs activate these sig￾naling networks have so far remained obscure.
TLRs are a family of pattern-recognition receptors that play a
critical role in the innate immune system by activating proinflam￾matory signaling pathways in response to microbial pathogens
(15). TLR4,the best-characterized TLR, bindsto LPS of gram-nega￾tive bacterial cell walls (15). Upon binding of LPS to TLR4 and its
coreceptors CD14 and MD-2, the adaptor protein myeloid differ￾entiation factor 88 (MyD88) is recruited to the Toll/IL-1 receptor
(TIR) domain of the receptor (16). Interaction of the TIR domain
of TLR4 and MyD88 triggers a downstream signaling cascade, lead￾ing to activation of the NF-κB pathway, which then activates the
transcription of many proinflammatory genes that encode proin￾flammatory moleculesincluding cytokines, chemokines, and other
effectors of the innate immune response (16). In light of data indi￾cating a pathophysiologic role for FFAsin inflammation and insu￾lin resistance, it is intriguing that the lipid component of LPS is
sufficient to trigger TLR4 signaling. In particular, a medium-chain
fatty acid component of LPS, lauric acid, has been shown to initi￾ate TLR4 signaling in a macrophage cell line (17–19). We therefore
hypothesized that the obesity-induced increase in FFA levels can
promote TLR4 signaling, which in turn contributes to obesity￾dependent insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis, we explored
the role of TLR4 as a mediator of fatty acid actions on adipose cells/
tissue and macrophages. To assessthe physiologicalrole of TLR4 as
a sensor of FFAs in vivo, we measured insulin signaling in muscle
and insulin-sensitive glucose metabolism by hyperinsulinemic-eug￾lycemic clamps following a 5-hour lipid infusion in TLR4-knock￾out and WT mice. We also investigated the role of TLR4 in energy
balance and insulin resistance in response to chronic changes in
dietary intake of fat by examining body weight, insulin sensitivity,
and tissue expression of inflammatory mediators in TLR4-knock￾out mice on low-fat chow and high-fat diets.
Results
FFAs activate NF-κB reporter in 293 cells and cytokine expression in macro￾phages via TLR4 signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that
lauric acid, a medium-chain fatty acid, can activate TLR4 signaling

in a macrophage cell line (17, 18). We examined whether palmitate
and oleate, 2 of the most abundant nutritional fatty acids, can also
activate TLR4 signaling. 293T cells were transiently transfected
with expression vectors for TLR4 and its cofactor MD-2, together
with an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct, and were then treated
with a 200 μM oleate/palmitate mixture or 100 ng/ml LPS as a
positive control. Figure 1A shows that FFA treatment stimulated
a doubling of NF-κB luciferase activity compared with treatment
with BSA control, mimicking LPS activation of NF-κB signaling.
Most TLR4 signaling is mediated through MyD88, an immediate
adaptor protein of TLR4 (15). Cotransfection of dominant-nega￾tive MyD88 substantially blocked both FFA and LPS activation
of NF-κB signaling (Figure 1A), indicating that FFA-induced
TLR4 signaling is MyD88 dependent. To determine whether FFAs
activate TLR4 signaling in macrophages with endogenous TLR4
expression, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from TLR4–/– and
WT mice and treated these cells with FFAs. Figure 1B shows that
FFAs caused the degradation of IκBα in WT macrophages but
not in TLR4-deficient macrophages. Similarly, FFAs induced JNK
phosphorylation in WT macrophages, while lack of TLR4 pre￾vented this action (Figure 1B). Figure 1, C and D, shows that FFAs
potently induced TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA in WT macrophages but
not in TLR4-deficient macrophages. Similar results were observed
when cytokine protein release was measured in macrophagestreat￾ed with FFAs (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that
FFAs are capable of utilizing TLR4 signaling to induce an inflam￾matory response in macrophages.
To better assessthe specificity of
FFA action to induce inflamma￾tory cytokine expression in mac￾rophages, we treated cells of mac￾rophage cell line RAW264.7 with
various saturated, unsaturated,
and trans fatty acids and exam￾ined cytokine expression. While
trans fatty acids, arachidonic
acid, and oleic acid induced
slight increases in IL-6 mRNA
expression, saturated fatty acids
potently stimulated IL-6 mRNA
(Figure 2A). To further confirm
the effects ofsaturated fatty acids
on cytokine expression, we treat￾ed RAW264.7 cells with various
doses of palmitic acid, using LPS
treatment as a positive control.
Figure 2B shows that palmitic
acid stimulated TNF-α mRNA in
a dose-dependent manner, mim￾icking LPS stimulation of TNF-α
expression.Interestingly, omega-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids such
as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
showed no effects on cytokine
expression, and pretreatment of
RAW264.7 cells with DHA com￾pletely inhibited saturated fatty
acid–induced TNF-α mRNA
expression (Figure 2C).
FFAs activate TLR4 signaling in adipose cells and tissue. We next
investigated whether FFAs can utilize TLR4 to induce inflamma￾tory signaling in adipocytes. It has been shown previously that
adipocytes can exhibit features typical of macrophages, such as
cytokine production and secretion (1, 2, 7). Using Northern blots,
we detected significant TLR4 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adi￾pocytes, isolated mouse adipocytes, and adipose tissue, compa￾rable to that in the unstimulated Raw 264.7 macrophage cell line
(Figure 3A). To assess the potential relevance of TLR4 in medi￾ating insulin resistance, we quantified TLR4 mRNA in adipose
tissue of genetically obese/diabetic mice as well as diet-induced
obese (DIO) mice. Figure 3, B and C, shows that TLR4 mRNA
expression was increased in epididymal fat depots of ob/ob, db/db,
and DIO mice. These data suggest that TLR4 mRNA expression is
elevated in adipose tissue of obese/diabetic mice. Because TLR2,
another member of the TLR family, has been reported to respond
to certain fatty acids,we also evaluated TLR2 expression in 3T3-L1
adipocytes. Using real time RT-PCR, TLR2 mRNA was detectable
in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and was markedly induced by treatment
with LPS, a TLR4 agonist (Figure 3D). To test whether TLR4 and
TLR2 are functional TLRs in adipocytes, we treated 3T3-L1 adi￾pocytes with the TLR4 agonist LPS and the TLR2 agonist zymo￾san. While zymosan had no effect on IL-6 mRNA, LPS markedly
stimulated IL-6 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure 3E).
These data suggest that TLR4 expressed in adipocytes is func￾tional in response to agonist treatment, whereas basal TLR2
expression is insufficient for cytokine induction.

We then examined whether FFAs can induce inflammatory
gene expression in adipocytes via TLR4. To this end, we reduced
TLR4 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by retroviral short hairpin
RNA interference (shRNAi) knockdown. The TLR4 mRNA lev￾els in the knockdown cells were suppressed by 78%, as assessed
by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 4A). We observed similar effects on
TLR4 protein levels, measured by immunoblotting (Figure 4B).
The TLR4 knockdown was specific, as TLR2 expression was not
affected (Figure 4C). The knockdown adipocytes and control cells
were then treated with 400 μM of FFAs (palmitate and oleate mix￾ture), with LPS used as a control. LPS potently stimulated IL-6
and TNF-α mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while FFAs
induced cytokine expression to a lesser extent (Figure 4, D and E).
In contrast, TLR4 knockdown substantially prevented FFA/LPS￾induced cytokine expression (Figure 4, D and E), indicating that
FFAs cause an inflammatory response mediated by TLR4 in adi￾pocytes. To study the role of endogenous TLR4 in mediating the
FFA-induced inflammatory response in adipocytes, we isolated
adipocytes from TLR4–/– and WT mice and examined the cytokine
expression and secretion in these cellsin response to FFAs and LPS.
Figure 4, F and G, shows that LPS significantly induces TNF-α
and IL-6 expression in WT adipocytes. FFAs were also capable of
upregulating these 2 cytokines, although to a lesser extent than
LPS. However, both FFA- and LPS-induced cytokine expression
were substantially reduced in adipocytes from TLR4–/– mice. Simi￾larresultswere observedwith cytokine secretion (Figure 4, H and I).
These data suggest that TLR4 participatesin FFA-induced inflam￾matory response of adipocytes in culture.
To investigate the role of endogenous TLR4 in mediating FFA￾induced inflammatory signaling in vivo, we infused TLR4–/– and
WT mice with lipid (coupled with heparin to activate lipopro￾tein lipase) to release FFAs into the circulation (Figure 5A) (13).
We employed EMSA to examine the nuclear translocation and
DNA binding of NF-κB, a downstream signaling target of TLR4
activation. An 8-hour lipid infusion markedly induced NF-κB
DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from adipose tissue of
WT mice (Figure 5B, right panel), mimicking the NF-κB DNA
binding induced by LPS (Figure 5B, left panel). However, both
lipid- and LPS-induced activation of NF-κB were prevented in
adipose tissue of TLR4–/– mice (Figure 5B). To further confirm
the lipid-induced activation of NF-κB, we combined chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with SYBR Green quantita￾tive PCR analysis to examine in vivo NF-κB binding to the con￾sensussequence of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP-1) promoters in adipose tissue of mice infused with lipid
or LPS. An 8-hour lipid infusion markedly increased NF-κB DNA
binding to the consensus sequence within the IL-6 promoter in
adipose tissue of WT mice, mimicking LPS-induced NF-κB DNA
binding to the IL-6 promoter (Figure 5C). In contrast, TLR4
deficiency prevented both lipid- and LPS-induced NF-κB DNA
binding to the IL-6 promoter (Figure 5C). Similar results were
observed with NF-κB DNA binding to the MCP-1 promoter (data
not shown). We further measured cytokine gene expression in
adipose tissue of mice infused with lipid. Consistent with NF-κB
activation, lipid infusion stimulated TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1
mRNA expression in adipose tissue of WT mice. However, this
effect was not seen in TLR4–/– mice (Figure 5, D–F).
TLR4 deficiency ameliorates impaired insulin signaling in muscle and 
reduced insulin-mediated glucose metabolism induced by lipid infusion.
To investigate the physiological consequence of lipid activation
of TLR4 signaling, we examined insulin signaling in muscle
and insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism in vivo. After an

8-hour lipid infusion, mice were injected with insulin to acutely
stimulate insulin signaling (Figure 6A). Lipid infusion markedly
inhibited insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate–1 (IRS-1)
phosphorylation in skeletal muscle of WT mice as indicated by
Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated muscle protein
extracts using antibodies specific to tyrosine-phosphorylated
IRS-1 protein (Figure 6B). This was substantially attenuated in
TLR4–/– mice. We further examined the docking of p85 to IRS-1
by immunoprecipitating IRS-1, followed by immunoblotting
using anti-p85 antibodies. As with IRS-1 phosphorylation, lipid
infusion markedly inhibited the docking of p85 to IRS-1 upon
insulin injection in WT mice, while in TLR4–/– mice, p85 docking
to IRS-1 was minimally affected by lipid infusion (Figure 6B). As
serine kinases such as iKK, normally activated in inflammatory
signaling, may cause serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, resulting
in the inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and impaired
insulin signaling, we evaluated the serine phosphorylation of
IRS-1 in skeletal muscle of mice infused with lipid. Figure 6C
shows that lipid infusion markedly induced serine (Ser307)
phosphorylation of IRS-1 in WT mice, while this stimulation was
greatly attenuated in TLR4–/– mice.
We further performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
studiesto examine the insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism in
TLR4–/– andWT mice infusedwitheithersaline orlipid (Figure 7A).
During a continuous insulin infusion at 2.5 mU/kg/min,
theglucose infusionrate requiredtomaintaineuglycemiaat5.5mM
was reduced by 65% in WT mice infused with lipid, compared
with mice infused with saline, indicating that the lipid infusion
induced insulin resistance. In contrast, lipid infusion exerted a
lesser effect on the glucose infusion rate in TLR4–/– mice,suggest￾ing thattheywere protected againstinsulin resistance (Figure 7B).
Similarly, after lipid infusion, insulin-stimulated glucose
turnover was decreased by 40% in WT mice, while this reduc￾tion was substantially attenuated in TLR4–/– mice (Figure 7C).
Consistent with the measures of whole-body glucose turnover,
lipid infusion decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into
skeletal muscle and fat of WT mice by 50%–60%, while this effect
was attenuated in TLR4–/– mice (Figure 7, D and E). Similarly,
insulin-stimulated glycolysis appeared to be suppressed to a
lesser extent in TLR4–/– mice after lipid infusion as compared
with WT mice (Figure 7F).
Effect of TLR4 expression on the response of mice to high-fat diets.
Female TLR4–/– and WT mice were fed low-fat chow or high-fat
diets over a period of 39 weeks. On chow diets, female TLR4–/–
mice weighed significantly more, by an average of 3.6 g by 39
weeks, than WT mice (Figure 8A). On high-fat diets, TLR4–/– mice
showed a more rapid and greater weight gain (Figure 8A). Elevat￾ed body weights were observed by 3 weeks after the start of the
diet, and the mean difference between genotypes was 9.2 g by
39 weeks. As assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, this
increased weight was attributable to increased fat mass, with no
change in lean mass (Figure 8B), and was caused by increased
food intake (Figure 8C), as there was no detectable change in
energy expenditure as assessed by metabolic chamber analysis
(data not shown). Despite the increased obesity in TLR4–/– mice,
insulin tolerance tests suggested that these mice were somewhat
more insulin sensitive, rather than more insulin resistant, than
WT mice (Figure 8D). To explore the molecular basis for this pro￾tection from insulin resistance, we examined the expression of
inflammatory genes in response to high-fat diets. While in WT
mice, high-fat diet–induced adipose tissue expression of TNF-α,
IL-6, SOCS3, MCP-1, and the macrophage marker F4/80, this
induction was greatly attenuated in TLR4–/– mice (Figure 8E).
Similar findings were obtained for gene expression in liver (Fig￾ure 8F). In male mice on chow or high-fat diets, there were no
differences between genotypes in body weight, food intake, or
insulin sensitivity (data not shown). Nonetheless, analysis of
gene expression revealed blunting of high-fat diet–induced
inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue and liver of male
TLR4–/– mice (data not shown).
Discussion
This article addresses the hypothesis that TLR4, the obligatory
receptor for bacterial LPS and a key molecular component of the
innate immune system, can play an additional role as well, as a
“sensor” for endogenous lipids that may contribute to the patho￾genesis of lipid-induced insulin resistance. The plausibility of this

hypothesis derives from several prior observations. First, obesity
and diabetes have been shown, through a variety of approaches,
to be associated with activation of inflammatory pathways in key
metabolic tissues aswell as macrophages(1, 2, 7, 12, 14, 20–23), and
these inflammatory signals and their downstream effectors have
been implicated as mediators of resistance to insulin action that
characterize these states (1, 2, 7). FFAs, whose levels are commonly
increased in obesity, have been implicated as proximate causes of
insulin resistance in several models(8–14, 24, 25) and have also been
shown to be capable of inducing inflammatory signaling in several
tissues(9, 26–32). FFAs have been shown to cause insulin resistance
in vivo — as evidenced by their impairment of insulin’s ability to
activate signal transduction, inhibit hepatic glucose production,
and stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue
(8, 9, 13, 25–27, 33). The molecular pathways by which FFAsinduce
insulin resistance have been investigated in insulin-sensitive tissues
such as fat and skeletal muscle. FFAs have been shown to activate
JNK and stimulate TNF-α expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while
blockage of JNK or TNF-α can prevent FFA-induced insulin resis￾tance, suggesting that fatty acid–induced insulin resistance may
be mediated in part by these proinflammatory signaling pathways
(26). Moreover, FFAs also activate the proinflammatory signal IKK/
NF-κB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, leading to expression ofthe cytokines
TNF-α and IL-6 (27, 28). However,the critical question of howFFAs
are sensed by adipocytes or other tissues in order to activate proin￾flammatory signaling networks remains uncertain. Whether such
sensing involves an intracellular target of FFA, is a consequence of
FFA metabolism to a subsequent mediator, orrequires an action of
FFA at the plasma membrane has not been determined.
Several plausible theories have been advanced to explain the abil￾ity of FFAs to activate intracellular inflammatory signals. These
include uptake and intracellular actions of FFAs, either through
their subsequent metabolism to species such as long-chain CoA
derivatives or via their action as ligands to modify nuclear recep￾tors. Proof that such mechanisms underlie fatty acid–induced
inflammatory signaling has yet to be provided. An additional or
alternative mechanism might involve actions of FFAs to modify
plasma membrane pathways that are capable of initiating inflam￾matory signals. Several G protein–coupled receptors have recently
been shown to respond to FFAs as a ligand (34, 35), but these
have not been implicated in FFA-induced inflammation or insu￾lin resistance. TLRs, including TLR4, are potential candidates for
such a role, as these receptors are known to initiate signals that
activate NF-κB, JNK, and SOCS pathways(15, 16, 19), all of which
participate in regulation of inflammation and have been proven
as well to be capable of inducing insulin resistance (12, 14, 20,
21, 36). In this regard, it has been shown that the C12 fatty acid
lauric acid, a major component of lipid A of LPS, is capable of
activating TLR4 signaling (17, 18). Nutritional fatty acids have
been shown, using in vitro systems, to activate TLR4 signaling
as well (17, 18). Thus, multiple lines of evidence converge on the
possibility that FFAs might initiate inflammatory signaling and
insulin resistance, at least in part, by activating TLR4 signaling
in one or more tissues and that such signaling might contribute
to insulin resistance, or at least that component related to FFAs.
In this study, we have combined a number of in vitro and in vivo
approaches to assess this hypothesis.
The function of TLR4 has been most extensively studied in cells
of the immune system, including macrophages. The relevance of
macrophagesto the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes was not previ￾ously viewed aslikely. However, overthe pastseveral years, a poten￾tial role for macrophages as mediators of insulin resistance has
emerged from elegant genetic studies (21–23), so potential activa￾tion of macrophage TLR4 by FFAs can now be readily linked to

insulin resistance. In addition, to the extent that TLR4 is expressed
in tissues directly involved in insulin’s metabolic actions, such as
adipose tissue and muscle, an ability of FFAs to activate TLR4 in
these tissues could be important as well. Ourfindingsin thisstudy
are relevant to both of these possibilities.
We have demonstrated that a mixture of palmitate and oleic
acid acts through TLR4 to induce NF-κB signaling in 293 cells,
confirming earlier observations (17, 18). In addition, we have
shown that palmitate acts through TLR4 on mouse peritoneal
macrophages to induce IκBα degradation and activate JNK. We
have also addressed the possibility that TLR4 is expressed on adi￾pocytes and can mediate inflammatory signaling in this cell type.
Our findings indicate that TLR4 is expressed on the 3T3-L1 adi￾pocytes in a differentiation-dependent manner and is expressed
in normal adipose tissue. The level of expression is similar to that
of unstimulated RAW cells. The expression of TLR4 mRNA in
total adipose tissue extracts increased in 2 models of obesity, and
this could be due in part to increased numbers of macrophages
known to reside in fat tissue of obese animals. In 3T3-L1 adi￾pocytes, FFAs induced increased expression of SOCS3 and IL-6
mRNA. In isolated mouse adipocytes, FFAs induced release of
TNF-α and IL-6, and, importantly, this action of FFA was not
observed in adipocytes from TLR4–/– mice.
To further examine the role of TLR4 in lipid-mediated inflam￾matory signaling in an in vivo setting, we utilized the model of
i.v. infusion of lipid plus heparin. This model has been used
repeatedly to demonstrate the ability of acute elevation of lip￾ids in vivo to suppress insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism
and insulin signaling (10, 11, 13). In this system, a 5-hour lipid
infusion in mice reduces the action of insulin to stimulate glu￾cose disposal into muscle and fat and suppresses insulin-medi￾ated signal transduction (10, 11, 13). In agreement with previ￾ous results, lipid infusion suppressed insulin-mediated glucose
disposal, as measured by euglycemic clamp, and glucose uptake
into muscle and fat, as assessed by 2-deoxyglucose uptake in WT
mice. In contrast, in mice lacking TLR4, this adverse effect of
lipid infusion was markedly suppressed.
To study the mechanism for the observed reduction in lipid￾induced insulinresistance inTLR4–/– mice,we assessed the ability of
lipid infusion to induce inflammatory signaling in adipose tissue.

We found 2 indications that lipid infusion activated NF-κB
signaling in adipose tissue, and this did not occur in TLR4–/–
mice. First, we determined by EMSA analysis that lipid infu￾sion activated NF-κB in adipose tissue. Second, we used ChIP
assays to show that lipid infusion induced binding of NF-κB to
sequences in the promoter of IL-6 and MCP-1 within adipose tis￾sue. Strikingly, this did not occur in mice lacking TLR4 in both
cases. Given the time course, it is most likely that this was due
to activation of NF-κB in adipocytes, but these findings are also
consistent with activation of macrophages either resident in adi￾pose tissue or recruited to adipose tissue during the course of
the infusion. The potential biologic significance of the findings
for insulin resistance in adipose tissue could be similar in either
case. The finding that lipid infusion reduced the ability of insu￾lin to acutely activate signaling through IRS-1 likely underlies
the reduced glucose uptake into muscle after lipid infusion. As
TLR4 expression on muscle cells has been described (37, 38), this
is likely a direct effect of lipid infusion on muscle cells, though
indirect effects may also be present.
Having demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that FFAs can act
through TLR4 on macrophages and adipocytes to induce inflam￾matory signaling and suppressinsulin signaling and insulin-medi￾ated regulation of glucose metabolism, we next sought to deter￾mine the impact of TLR4 on high-fat diet–induced obesity and
metabolic sequelae. In female mice, TLR4 status had a clear effect
on energy homeostasis, with increased weight gain and fat mass,
exaggerated by high-fat diet. This was attributed to increased
food intake rather than changes in energy expenditure. Despite
the increased obesity linked to TLR4 deficiency, insulin tolerance
tests in female TLR4–/– mice showed improved insulin sensitivity.
Consistent with the initial hypothesis of our studies, this protec￾tion from high-fat diet–induced insulin resistance was associated
with failure of high-fat diet to induce expression of inflammatory
mediators or indicators in liver and fat. These data suggest that,
in female C57BL/6J mice, TLR4 is in part required for the ability
of high-fat diet to induce inflammatory mediators in peripheral
tissues and may thereby contribute as well to the insulin resistance
that develops. The results do not support the conclusion that
TLR4 is the exclusive mechanism, however, as insulin resistance
of lesser degree was seen after high-fat diet in TLR4–/– mice. The
fact that these changes in energy balance and insulin sensitivity
were not evident in male mice despite suppression of inflamma￾tory markers indicates that TLR4 and these inflammatory media￾tors are among a larger set of factors involved in linking diet, obe￾sity, and insulin resistance, and these factors are subject to further
modification by sex-specific factors. In addition, our data strongly
suggest that while lipid infusion protocols can provide valuable
insights into potential mechanisms for lipid-induced changes in
insulin signaling and insulin resistance, this model is not neces￾sarily predictive of the findingsin mice fed high-fat diets. Whether
the differences between these models are the result of different
circulating FFA levels, the nature of specific fatty acids involved,
variable duration of exposure, or otherfactorsremainsto be deter￾mined. With respect to FFA levels, our data closely resemble those
of Kim et al. (39), who found that mean FFA levels were elevated
4-fold by high-fat diet but 5- to 6-fold after lipid infusion.
Additional study is needed to determine the cells/tissues in
which TLR4 signaling is required for regulation of systemic
insulin sensitivity. FFAs cause inflammatory responses in insu￾lin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle, resulting in both
local and systemic insulin resistance. Two inflammatory kinas￾es, PKC-θ and IKKα, appear to play roles in fatty acid–induced
insulin resistance in muscle, since PKC-θ or IKKα knockout or
inactivation of IKKα by high-dose salicylate can prevent FFA￾induced defects in insulin signaling and insulin resistance in
skeletal muscle (10, 11). In a human study, lipid-induced insulin
resistance was associated with activation of IKK/NF-κB signal￾ing in skeletal muscle (29). Further studies confirmed that FFAs
activate IKK/NF-κB signaling in myotubes, leading to cytokine
expression (30, 31). Since skeletal muscle cells express functional
TLR4 that activates proinflammatory signaling in response to
LPS (37, 38), it is possible that FFA-induced insulin resistance in
skeletal muscle is mediated by FFA activation of TLR4 expressed
on muscle cells. Indeed, our data show that TLR4 deficiency
substantially limits impaired insulin signaling and insulin resis￾tance caused by lipid infusion in muscle. However, additional
studies, involving, for example, specific deletion of TLR4 in indi￾vidual tissues, will be required to determine to what extent the
improved insulin sensitivity in response to FFAs in a given tissue
such as muscle is due to the direct effect of TLR4 deficiency in
that tissue, as opposed to systemic effects secondary to changes
exerted in adipose tissue or macrophages.
The obesity observed in female TLR4–/– mice is worthy of dis￾cussion. The mechanism involves changes in food intake and pre￾sumably indicates some changes in the CNS circuitry involved in

appetite regulation. At this time, it is unclear by what mechanism
this arises secondary to TLR4 deficiency. It is possible that TLR4
deficiency in a peripheral tissue results in altered levels of a sys￾temic regulator of appetite or that TLR4 deficiency in CNS has a
more direct role. TLR4 expression has been identified in several
brain regions (40), but whether such receptors play a role energy
balance will require additional studies.
In summary, although FFAs are known to play a key role in the
etiology of insulin resistance, the molecular sensing mechanisms
through which high levels of FFAs are transduced to produce
intracellular inflammatory signaling, which then induces insu￾lin resistance, have remained obscure. We have shown here that
FFAs are capable of utilizing the innate immune receptor TLR4
to induce proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages,
adipocytes, and liver. Moreover, TLR4 signaling appears to be
required for a component of insulin resistance induced by FFAsin
adipocytes and in vivo afterlipid infusion and high-fat diets. These
data therefore suggest a previously unappreciated link between the
innate immune system and metabolism and suggest that TLR4
may be involved in other adverse effects of FFAs on tissues and
processes that constitute the metabolic syndrome.
Methods
Animals. TLR4-knockout (TLR4–/–) mice (41) were kindly provided by D.T.
Golenbock (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA)
and were backcrossed 6 generations into the C57BL6/J strain. WT litter￾mates were used as controls. The 16-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. For DIO mice, C57BL/6J mice
were fed high-fat diets (D12331; Research Diets Inc.) for 16 weeks. The
animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Cell culture. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte culture and differentiation were
conducted as previously described (36). For the TLR4 siRNA knockdown
study, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were infected with retroviral siRNA, which
was constructed according to the manufacturer’s manual (RNAi-Ready
pSIREN-RetroQ Vector; BD Biosciences — Clontech). Cells were selected
with puromycin and then differentiated into adipocytes. Primary-cultured
adipocytes were also isolated and cultured as previously described (41),
with the isolated adipocytes being precultured for 6 hours before treat￾ment. Peritoneal macrophages from TLR4–/– and WT mice were isolated
by lavage 4 days after i.p. injection of 3% thioglycollate (2.5 ml; Difco; BD
Diagnostics) (42). The cells were plated at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/well
in 6-well plates and cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS. Fatty
acids (oleate and palmitate mixture; Sigma-Aldrich) were conjugated with
BSA at a 4:1 molar ratio before treatment. Palmitate was dissolved in 95%
ethanol at 60°C and then was mixed with prewarmed BSA (10%) to yield
a stock concentration of 7.5 mM. The endotoxin content of BSA–fatty
acid conjugates was measured with the Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte
Lysate (LAL) Test (Cambrex). The BSA–fatty acid preparations contained
less than 0.04 ng/ml endotoxin, which in our studies did not cause sig￾nificant inflammatory signaling in either macrophages or adipocytes. LPS
from Escherichia coli 0127:B8 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The IL-6 and TNF-α protein secreted into medium were measured using
mouse IL-6 and TNF-α ELISA kits (R&D Systems).
Transfection and luciferase reporter assay. Murine TLR4, MD-2, and MyD88
cDNA constructs were kindly provided by R. Medzhitov (Yale University,
New Haven, Connecticut, USA), D.T. Golenbock (University of Massa￾chusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA), and J.T. Schopp (University of
Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland), respectively. These cDNA constructs
were further subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vectors (Invitrogen).
pNFκB-Luc vectors were purchased from BD Biosciences — Clontech.
293T cells were transfected with expression vectors using a SuperFect

Transfection Reagent kit (QIAGEN), and luciferase activity was measured
using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA extraction, quantitative RT-PCR, and Northern blots. Adipose tis￾sue, skeletal muscle, and macrophage total RNA was extracted using an
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) or Tri Reagent kit (Molecular Research Center)
and DNase I treatment (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s proto￾col. mRNA expression of inflammatory genes was assessed by quantitative
RT-PCR (Brilliant Single-Step, Stratagene) using a Stratagene Mx 4000 ther￾mocycler, as previously described (36). The DNA sequence of primers and
probes corresponding to mouse inflammatory genes is as follows: TNF-α,
forward, GACCCTCACACTCAGATCATCTTCT, reverse, CCACTTGGT￾GGTTTGCTACGA, probe, AAAATTCGAGTGACAAGCCTGTAGCCCA;
MCP-1,forward, GGCTCAGCCAGATGCAGTTAA,reverse,CCTACTCATT￾GGGATCATCTTGCT, probe, CCCCACTCACCTGCTGCTACTCATTCAC;
TLR4, forward, GCAGAAAATGCCAGGATGATG, reverse, AACTACCTC￾TATGCAGGGATTCAAG, probe, CCTGGCTAGGACTCTGATCATG￾GCACTGT. IL-6 primer and probe pairwas purchased from Applied Biosys￾tems. Northern blots were conducted as previously described (43).
Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
experiments were conducted as previously described (13). The procedure is
summarized in Figure 1. Three-month-old male TLR4–/– and littermate WT
mice with an average body weight of 30 g were implanted with indwelling
catheters (Micro-Renathane tubing; MRE-025; Braintree Scientific Inc.)
in the right jugular veins. After a 5-day recovery, overnight-fasted mice
were preinfused with lipid (5 ml/kg/h; Liposyn II; Abbott) and heparin
(6 U/h) or saline for 5 hours with a microdialysis pump (CMA/102; CMA
Microdialysis). After an initial 5-μCi bolus, [3-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer)
was infused at 0.05 μCi/min for 2 hours to measure basal glucose turn￾over. With the continuous infusion of lipid or saline, a 2-hour hyperinsu￾linemic-euglycemic clamp was conducted with a primed and continuous
infusion of human insulin (Humulin; Lilly) at a rate of 2.5 mU/kg/min,
coupled with a variable infusion of 20% glucose to maintain blood glucose
concentrations at 5.5 mM. The rate of whole-body glucose turnover was
estimated using a continuous infusion of [3-3H]-glucose at 0.1 μCi/min
after a 10-μCi bolus. Blood was collected during the hyperinsulinemic
period for measurement of whole-body glucose turnover and glycolysis,
which were determined as previously described (13). Tissue-specific glu￾cose uptake was estimated by a bolus administration of 10 μCi 2-deoxy-d-
[1-14C]-glucose (PerkinElmer) 45 minutes before the end of clamp experi￾ments. At the end of the experiments, mice were euthanized, and tissues
were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis of
2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]-glucose content and insulin signaling. Tissue-specific
glucose uptake was calculated as previously described (13).

In vivo insulin signaling studies. In vivo insulin signaling experiments were
performed on mice after an 8-hour lipid infusion as described above. Mice
were injected with 10 U/kg BW of human insulin (Lilly) or saline via the
jugular vein. Five minutes after injection, skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius)
was dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunoprecipitation and
immunoblotting analysis of insulin signaling proteins.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Skeletal muscle (gastrocne￾mius) from in vivo insulin signaling and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
studies was homogenized in a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) and supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma￾Aldrich) and 1% tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were conducted as previously
described (21). Rabbit polyclonal anti–insulin receptor antibody was pur￾chased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit polyclonal anti–IRS-1,
phospho–IRS-1 (Ser307), mouse monoclonal anti–phosphotyrosine
4G10, rabbit polyclonal anti-p85 antibodies, and protein A agarose were
obtained from Upstate USA Inc.
EMSA. After lipid infusion, adipose tissue was collected for EMSA
analysis. Adipose tissue nuclear extracts were prepared as previously
described (44). The consensus NF-κB oligonucleotides (Promega)
were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer) using T4 polynucleo￾tide kinase (Promega). The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on
a Novex 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen). A reaction containing
20-fold excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides (cold) was also
included in each run. Gels were dried and analyzed by a PhosphorImager
system (Molecular Dynamics).
ChIP assay. After lipid infusion, adipose tissue was collected for ChIP
assay. ChIP assays were conducted using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a modification.
Briefly, adipose tissue was cut into small pieces and fixed with 1% of
formaldehyde. Samples were then homogenized in cell lysis buffer
(5 mM PIPES, 85 mM KCl, and 0.5% NP-40, supplemented with protease
inhibitors, pH 8.0) using a dounce homogenizer to isolate nuclei. The
nuclei were resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM
EDTA, and 1% SDS, supplemented with protease inhibitors, pH 8.1)
and sonicated to shear genomic DNA to an average fragment length of
200–1,000 bp. Lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were col￾lected. Fifty microliters of each sample was removed as the input control.
The supernatants underwent overnight immunoprecipitation, elution,
reverse cross-linking, and protease K digestion, according to the manu￾facturer’s manual. A mock immunoprecipitation without antibody was
also included for each sample. The DNAs recovered from phenol/chlo￾roform extraction were used for SYBR Green quantitative PCR (Applied
Biosystems), and the DNA quantitation value of each sample was further
normalized with the DNA quantitation of individual input control. The
primer sequences for the NF-κB binding sites on the IL-6 promoter were
5′-GACATGCTCAAGTGCTGAGTCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGATTGCA￾CAATGTGACGTCG-3′ (reverse), and the primersequencesforthe MCP-1
promoter were 5′-CAGCATCTGGAGCTCACATTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-
GCATGAACAAGTTGAGAGATGCC-3′ (reverse).
DIO studies. Six-week-old mice (n = 8 per group) were placed on either
chow diet (6% of the calories as fat; Teklad F6 Rodent Diet 8664; Harlan
Teklad) or high-fat diet (59% of the calories as fat; F3282; Bio-Serv). Body
weight and food intakewere measuredweekly, if not otherwise indicated. At
26weeks, micewere subjected to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to exam￾ine body composition (Lunar PIXImus mouse densitometer; PIXImus).
Intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were performed at 36 weeks. Mice
were injected with insulin (Humulin R; Lilly) after 4 hours of fasting, and
glucose levels were measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes using a
OneTouch Ultra glucometer (LifeScan).
Statistics. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were evaluated for
statistical significance by 1-way ANOVA, and statistical significance for
comparison of means of different groups was calculated by the least-signif￾icant-difference test using the SPSS software package version 11.5. P < 0.05
was considered significant.
