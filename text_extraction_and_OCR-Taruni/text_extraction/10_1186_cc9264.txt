Abstract
Introduction: Pulmonary vascular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and resulting right ventricular (RV)
failure occur in many critical illnesses and may be associated with a worse prognosis. PH and RV failure may be
difficult to manage: principles include maintenance of appropriate RV preload, augmentation of RV function, and
reduction of RV afterload by lowering pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). We therefore provide a detailed update
on the management of PH and RV failure in adult critical care.
Methods: A systematic review was performed, based on a search of the literature from 1980 to 2010, by using
prespecified search terms. Relevant studies were subjected to analysis based on the GRADE method.
Results: Clinical studies of intensive care management of pulmonary vascular dysfunction were identified,
describing volume therapy, vasopressors, sympathetic inotropes, inodilators, levosimendan, pulmonary vasodilators,
and mechanical devices. The following GRADE recommendations (evidence level) are made in patients with
pulmonary vascular dysfunction: 1) A weak recommendation (very-low-quality evidence) is made that close
monitoring of the RV is advised as volume loading may worsen RV performance; 2) A weak recommendation (low￾quality evidence) is made that low-dose norepinephrine is an effective pressor in these patients; and that 3) low￾dose vasopressin may be useful to manage patients with resistant vasodilatory shock. 4) A weak recommendation
(low-moderate quality evidence) is made that low-dose dobutamine improves RV function in pulmonary vascular
dysfunction. 5) A strong recommendation (moderate-quality evidence) is made that phosphodiesterase type III
inhibitors reduce PVR and improve RV function, although hypotension is frequent. 6) A weak recommendation
(low-quality evidence) is made that levosimendan may be useful for short-term improvements in RV performance.
7) A strong recommendation (moderate-quality evidence) is made that pulmonary vasodilators reduce PVR and
improve RV function, notably in pulmonary vascular dysfunction after cardiac surgery, and that the side-effect
profile is reduced by using inhaled rather than systemic agents. 8) A weak recommendation (very-low-quality
evidence) is made that mechanical therapies may be useful rescue therapies in some settings of pulmonary
vascular dysfunction awaiting definitive therapy.
Conclusions: This systematic review highlights that although some recommendations can be made to guide the
critical care management of pulmonary vascular and right ventricular dysfunction, within the limitations of this
review and the GRADE methodology, the quality of the evidence base is generally low, and further high-quality
research is needed.

Introduction
Pulmonary vascular dysfunction is a broad term and
may be central to several disease processes in the inten￾sive care unit (ICU). Components include pulmonary
endothelial dysfunction, altered lung microvascular per￾meability, vasoactive mediator imbalance, abnormal
hypoxic vasoconstriction, pulmonary metabolic failure,
microvascular thrombosis, and later, vascular remodel￾ling [1-3]. The resulting elevation in pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) may
increase the transpulmonary gradient, and the right ven￾tricular “pressure overload” can in turn result in right
ventricular (RV) dysfunction and failure [4]. RV dysfunc￾tion may also result from volume overload or a primary
RV pathology reducing contractility, including RV
infarction and sepsis (Table 1) [4-7].
PH is defined at right-heart catheterization in the out￾patient setting, with resting mPAP exceeding 25 mm
Hg, and a PVR greater than 240 dyn.s.cm-5 (3 Wood
units) [8]. At echocardiography, the presence of PH is
suggested by the estimated RV systolic pressure (RVSP)
exceeding 35 mm Hg (being severe if >50 mm Hg) (see
later) [9], and the pulmonary arterial acceleration time
(PAT) may be shortened [10]. Pulmonary arterial hyper￾tension (PAH) defines PH not due to left-heart disease,
with PAOP <15 mm Hg or without echocardiographic
evidence of increased left atrial pressure. The severity of
PH may depend on the chronicity: the actual pulmonary
artery pressure generated will increase with time as the
RV hypertrophies.
RV dysfunction describes reduced RV contractility,
which may be detected in several ways. At echocardio￾graphy, RV distention causes the intraventricular septum
to deviate, with resulting paradoxic septal movement
that impinges on LV function [11]. RV function may be
difficult to assess on echocardiography, especially in
ventilated patients, and measurement of the descent of
the RV base toward the apex (tricuspid annular systolic
excursion, TAPSE) or RV fractional shortening may
useful [12,13]. Invasive monitoring may show a CVP
exceeding the PAOP, or increasing CVP and PVR with a
decreasing cardiac output (and mPAP may therefore
decrease), and high right ventricular end-diastolic filling
pressure is characteristic. By using an RV ejection frac￾tion (RVEF) PAC, an increase in RV end-diastolic index
and a reduction in RVEF are seen [14]. We have defined
RV failure to be the clinical result of RV dysfunction
with the onset of hypotension or any resulting end￾organ (for example, renal, liver, or gastrointestinal) dys￾function. Acute cor pulmonale (ACP) refers to acute
right heart failure in the setting of acutely elevated PVR
due to pulmonary disease [15,16].
Pulmonary hypertension per se is frequently encoun￾tered in the ICU. It is commonly due to elevated pul￾monary venous pressure in the setting of left-sided heart
disease, or in patients with preexisting pulmonary vascu￾lar disease. It is well recognized after cardiothoracic sur￾gery, in part related to the endothelial dysfunction seen
with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) [17,18]. PH is also
associated with sepsis [19]; acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) [20-22] (with associated acute RV
failure in 10% to 25% of cases [23,24]), and in up to
60% of patients after massive pulmonary embolism (PE)
[25]. PH is important to recognize in the ICU because
its presence predicts increased mortality in these condi￾tions [19,23,25-31] as well as after surgical procedures
[32-42]. Mortality from cardiogenic shock due to RV
infarction (>50%) exceeds that due to LV disease [5].
We therefore thought that a systematic review of the
current evidence for the management of PH, resulting
RV dysfunction, and failure in adult patients in the ICU,
would be a useful addition to the critical care literature.
The pulmonary circulation and pathophysiology of right
ventricular failure
The normal pulmonary circulation is a high-flow, low￾pressure system. Unlike the left ventricle (LV), the thin￾walled right ventricle tolerates poorly acute increases in

afterload. This may lead to acute distention (Figure 1)
[4,43], with a resulting increase in oxygen consumption
and reduction in contractility [44]. The dilated RV,
together with paradoxic intraventricular septal move￾ment [45], lead to reduced LV filling [46], cardiac out￾put (CO), and oxygen delivery [47]. The principle of
ventricular interdependence is important in most set￾tings: superficial myocardial fibers encircle both ventri￾cles; thus they are contained within the same pericardial
cavity (except maybe after cardiac surgery), as well as
sharing a septum, effectively existing “in series” [48,49].
This explains the decrease in LV output seen during
positive-pressure ventilation [48,50,51] and why RV
pressure and volume overload cause diastolic dysfunc￾tion of the LV [52]. Furthermore, because of the RV/LV
interactions, the LV may markedly depend on atrial con￾traction for filling and may tolerate atrial fibrillation and
vasodilating therapy particularly poorly [49,53,54].
In addition, perfusion of the right coronary artery is
usually dependent on a pressure gradient between the
aorta and the right ventricle, which, in the setting of
increased RV afterload and decreased coronary blood
flow, may lead to RV ischemia [55], with further severe
hemodynamic decompensation [56] (Figure 2). In acute￾on-chronic RV-pressure overload, the already-hypertro￾phied RV tolerates much higher pressures before
decompensation [57,58], although the ability of the RV
to augment CO in chronic PH may be restricted by its
relatively “fixed” afterload. In any setting, the most com￾mon cause of increased RV afterload is an increase in
PVR (Table 2).
The gold standard for the diagnosis and management
of PH and RV dysfunction in the ICU setting is con￾sidered by some to be through pulmonary artery cathe￾terization (PAC), even though most of the information
can be obtained noninvasively by echocardiography:
the requirement for PAC in this population remains
controversial. It must, however, be acknowledged that
it provides the only direct continuous measurement of
right-sided pressures and direct measurement of RV
afterload, whereby, through measurement of cardiac
output, pulmonary pressures and the pulmonary artery
occlusion pressure (PAOP, the “wedge”), the PVR can
be calculated (Figure 3). Overall outcomes are not
improved when the PAC is used in general in critically
ill patients; and complications do occur [59]: the use
in general is therefore declining. However, no studies
have been done in the “pulmonary vascular” subpopu￾lation. Alternative invasive hemodynamic measure￾ments, such as CVP, may be useful surrogates for
volume status in RV failure, by using the diastolic
component of the CVP. Importantly, when monitoring
CVP in patients with significant tricuspid regurgitation
(TR), the variable V wave may be misleading, as it is
included in the mean CVP calculation on most auto￾mated machines, and if rising, indicates RV overdisten￾tion. In the setting of cardiac surgery, one study shows
that PAC use has reduced from 100% to 9% from 1997
to 2001, thought to reflect increased use of transeso￾phageal echocardiography (TEE) [60]. In the setting of
cardiac surgery, PAC may remain indicated for patients
with PH and low CO and those predicted to have a

difficult postoperative course [60], when a Swan intro￾ducer sheath may be inserted preemptively, or inserted
for continuous monitoring after a diagnosis of RV dys￾function made with echocardiography [61]. PAC is also
a useful cardiac monitor with intraaortic balloon coun￾terpulsation. Few data exist on PAC in other settings
of pulmonary vascular dysfunction in the ICU, but one
study suggests that PVR may be a poor indicator of
pulmonary-circulation status in ventilated patients with
ALI/ARDS [62]. The role of echocardiography, both
transthoracic (TTE) and TEE, is increasingly recog￾nized in assessing RV function in many ICU settings
[63-65] and provides essential information about RV
geometry and function. PA pressures may be assessed
by estimating the systolic-pressure gradient across the
tricuspid valve by using the modified Bernoulli equa￾tion [9,66,67], and although the correlation between
invasive and sonographic measurement has been
shown to be excellent in these studies, no studies have
correlated PAC with echocardiographic measurements
in the ICU population. In reality, a combination of
invasive and noninvasive techniques is used. Biomar￾kers such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are useful
in monitoring chronic PAH [68], in risk-stratifying

acute pulmonary embolism (see later) [69-71], and in
identifying ARDS-related pulmonary vascular dysfunc￾tion [72], although their role is less clear in other ICU
settings.
The diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary
embolism (PE) warrants a specific mention, as it is a
relatively common cause of acute RV failure in the ICU
[73]. Available therapies include thrombolysis and
embolectomy, reducing the clot burden and acute mor￾tality [74,75], as well as reducing the longer-term risk of
chronic thromboembolic PH [76]. Given that more than
half of related deaths occur within an hour of the onset
of symptoms [77], effective supportive treatment of
shock is paramount. Patients presenting with acute PE
are risk stratified according to the effects of elevated RV
afterload: hypotensive patients and those with elevated
cardiac biomarkers or echocardiographic indices of RV
strain, or both, are deemed at increased risk, and throm￾bolysis is indicated [78].
The management of PH and RV dysfunction in the
ICU is challenging. No agreed algorithms exist, although
treatment should aim to prevent pulmonary hypertensive
crises and acute cor pulmonale [79]. These comprise the
spectrum of acute pulmonary vascular dysfunction and
may result in cardiovascular collapse due to resulting
biventricular failure. Management principles include the
following: 1) optimization of RV preload, 2) optimization
of RV systolic function, 3) reduction of afterload by
reduction of increased PVR, and 4) maintenance of aortic
root pressure to ensure sufficient right coronary artery
filling pressure (Table 3).
Materials and methods
Systematic review of ICU management of pulmonary
vascular and RV dysfunction
We performed a systematic review of the literature over
the period from 1980 to 2010, by using set search
terms, and the electronic database of the US National
Library of Medicine and National Institute of Health
(PubMed). After initial identification, abstracts were
reviewed for relevance, and appropriate studies were
included in the review. Reference lists of relevant articles
were hand-searched for further studies and reports. The
search was limited to publications in English. Studies
were deemed suitable for inclusion according to the cri￾teria listed and where the patient population and study
design was defined; and the outcomes were limited to
those depending on the specific GRADE question (see
Additional file 1). The breakdown of articles obtained by
the systematic search is shown (Table 4). After identifi￾cation, relevant studies were included and subjected to a
GRADE analysis [80,81] to see whether we could make
specific management recommendations.
Results and Discussion
ICU management of pulmonary vascular and RV
dysfunction
Management of PH with associated RV dysfunction in
the ICU setting can be broken down into several treat￾ment goals (Table 3). The first is to ensure adequate but
not excessive RV filling or preload in the context of suf￾ficient systemic blood pressure. The second goal is to
maximize RV myocardial function, whether with inotro￾pic support, rate or rhythm management, atrioventricu￾lar synchronization [82,83], or by using mechanical
devices. The third is to offload the right ventricle by
reducing the PVR with pulmonary vasodilators as well
as by ensuring adequate oxygenation, avoiding hyper￾capnia and acidosis, and by minimizing mechanical
compression of pulmonary vessels (for example, due to
excessive airway plateau pressure). The fourth is to
maintain adequate aortic root pressure to allow
sufficient right coronary arterial perfusion.

Management of volume and use of vasopressors
Systemic hypotension may relate to sepsis, overdiuresis,
or progression of RV failure itself. Principles of volume
management and vasopressor use are summarized.
Volume management
With a normal RV, RV ejection fraction is usually pri￾marily dependent on RV preload [84]. In the setting of
excessive myocardial distention (by fluids), wall tension
increases according to the Frank-Starling mechanism,
and muscle fiber length is increased, beyond a certain
point at which ventricular function will fail. This situa￾tion may be precipitated sooner in the setting of PH
and RV dysfunction, in which both hypo- and hypervo￾lemia may reduce cardiac output [78,85,86]. In stable
patients with PAH, high plasma volumes are associated
with worse outcomes [87], but very few clinical studies
have been performed in pulmonary vascular dysfunction,
and the use of fluid loading remains controversial. Some
animal studies show that fluids increase the cardiac
index [88]; others show that they worsen shock by indu￾cing RV ischemia or decreasing LV filling or both as the
result of ventricular diastolic interdependence (due to
an increase in RV volume) [89-91].
In acute cor pulmonale after massive PE, increased
filling may be at least initially required [4,92]. In obser￾vational studies in sepsis, up to 40% of patients have evi￾dence of RV failure [93], predominantly due to primary
RV dysfunction [7]. These patients have a higher CVP
at baseline [94] and are unable to augment stroke
volume or perfusion pressure with fluid challenges
alone, and so usually also require catecholamines
[93,94].
RV volume overload is a very important principle to
recognize and treat promptly in RV failure. It may be
identified by a rising V wave on the CVP trace, or by
increased TR due to RV overdistention seen at echocar￾diography. In this situation of “backwards” heart failure,
no further escalation of vasoactive agents is likely to be
helpful (and may even be harmful), and management
involves fluid removal (by using diuresis [95] or hemofil￾tration [96]) and avoidance of excessive RV afterload
[97]. Unmonitored fluid challenges are inadvisable in
any setting of RV failure [98,99].
GRADE RECOMMENDATION 1
Based on overall very-low-quality evidence (see Addi￾tional file 1), the following WEAK recommendation is
made: Close monitoring of fluid status according to
effects on RV function is recommended. Initial carefully
monitored limited volume loading may be useful after
acute PE, but may also worsen RV performance in some
patients with pulmonary vascular dysfunction, and
vasoactive agents may be required.
Vasopressors
An essential goal is to maintain systemic blood pressure
above pulmonary arterial pressures, thereby preserving
right coronary blood flow: unlike left coronary artery
perfusion, which occurs only during diastole (as aortic
pressure exceeds LV pressure only during this period),
perfusion of the right coronary artery usually occurs
throughout the cardiac cycle, dominating in systole. It is
understood that, as PVR approaches SVR, coronary per￾fusion will decrease, and if PVR exceeds SVR, coronary
filling will occur only in diastole. By augmenting aortic
root pressure by using vasopressors in the setting of
increased RV afterload, RV ischemia can therefore be
reversed [55]. Vasopressors will, however, inevitably
have direct effects on the pulmonary circulation as well
as myocardial effects (Table 5).
Sympathomimetic pressors These include the
catecholaminergic pressor, norepinephrine, and the non￾catecholaminergic pressor phenylephrine. Their complex
effects on the pulmonary circulation depend on the
dose-related relative a- and b-adrenoreceptor stimula￾tion as well as the degree and nature of RV dysfunction
[99,100]. All may potentially lead to tachydysrhythmias,
diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, hyperlactate￾mia, and hypercoagulability [101].
Norepinephrine Norepinephrine (NE) exerts its sys￾temic vasopressor effects through a-1 agonism [102].
Activation of these receptors also causes pulmonary
vasoconstriction [102,103], although the potential
adverse effects on PVR are likely to occur only at high
doses. Most evidence supporting this comes from ani￾mal studies in models of pulmonary vascular dysfunc￾tion, with NE at doses less than 0.5 μg/kg/min not
increasing PVR [44]. In persistent PH of the newborn,
low-dose NE (0.5 μg/kg/min) reduces the PVR/SVR
ratio [104]. In adults with septic shock, higher doses of
NE increase PVR/SVR, although without worsening RV
performance [105]. In patients with sepsis, PH, and
associated RV dysfunction, NE increases SVR and
improves the RV oxygen supply/demand ratio, although
it does not increase RVEF and does increase PVR [106].
Importantly, NE is positively inotropic through b-1

receptor agonism, thus improving RV/pulmonary arter￾ial coupling, CO, and RV performance in studies of
acute RV dysfunction due to PH [44,89,107-109], illu￾strated in a case report of acute PH after MVR surgery
[110]. In patients with chronic PH, NE reduces the
PVR/SVR ratio, although it may not improve CI [100],
which may relate to the “fixed” elevation in PVR [99].
Phenylephrine Phenylephrine (PHE) is a direct a-ago￾nist. Its use improves right coronary perfusion in RV
failure [55] without causing tachycardia, although this
benefit may be offset by worsening RV function due to
increased PVR [100,108,111].
GRADE RECOMMENDATION 2
Based on mostly low-quality evidence (see Additional
file 1), the following WEAK recommendation is made:
NE may be an effective systemic pressor in patients with
acute RV dysfunction and RV failure, as it improves RV
function both by improving SVR and by increasing CO,
despite potential increases in PVR at higher doses.
Nonsympathomimetic pressors: Vasopressin
Arginine vasopressin (AVP) causes systemic vasocon￾striction via the vasopressinergic (V1) receptor. Experi￾mental studies have revealed vasodilating properties at
low doses that include pulmonary vasodilatation [112]
through an NO-dependent mechanism via V1 receptors
[113,114]. This property manifests clinically as a reduc￾tion in PVR and PVR/SVR ratio [105,115,116]. AVP has
also been used as a rescue therapy in patients during
PH crises [117-119], in which untreated equalization of
systemic and pulmonary pressures may be rapidly fatal.
At low doses (0.03-0.067 U/min), it has been used safely
in sepsis [105,120-124], as well as in patients with acute
PH and RV failure with hypotension after cardiac
surgery [115,116,125,126] and hypotension associated
with chronic PH in several settings [117,118,127,128].
AVP leads to a diuretic effect in vasodilatory shock
[129], reduces the heart rate [105,121,130-132], and
induces fewer tachyarrhythmias in comparison to NE
[105,131]. However, bradycardia [133] may be encoun￾tered at high clinical doses [134,135]. AVP may cause
dose-related adverse myocardial effects at infusion rates
exceeding 0.4 U/min [134,135], or even above 0.08 U/
min in cardiogenic shock [136], which probably relate to
direct myocardial effects, including coronary vasocon￾striction [132,137-139].
GRADE RECOMMENDATION 3
Based on mostly low-quality evidence (see Additional
file 1), the following WEAK recommendation is made:
In patients with vasodilatory shock and pulmonary vas￾cular dysfunction, low-dose AVP may be useful in diffi￾cult cases that are resistant to usual treatments,
including norepinephrine.
Inotropic augmentation of RV myocardial
function
The next major goal is to improve RV myocardial func￾tion by using inotropes. The use of mechanical support
is discussed later. For sympathomimetic agents, desir￾able cardiac b1 effects at lower doses maybe offset by
chronotropic effects precipitating tachyarrhythmias
[140], as well as worsening pulmonary vasoconstriction
at higher doses [102] through a-agonism. Systemic
hypotension may result from these agents and with
phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which may necessitate
co-administration of vasopressors.

Inotropes
Sympathomimetic inotropes
Few clinical studies of these agents have been done in
patients with PH and RV dysfunction. Dopamine
increases CO, although it may cause a mild tachycardia
in patients with PH [141] and increase the PVR/SVR
ratio [142]. Dopamine also tends to increase the heart
rate and to have less-favorable hemodynamic effects in
patients with cardiomyopathy than dobutamine [143],
although it does not increase PVR at doses up to 10 μg/
kg/min in animals with pulmonary vascular dysfunction
[144]. In patients with septic shock, PH, and RV dys￾function, dopamine improves CI without an increase in
PVR [145]. In the recent large randomized controlled
study comparing dopamine with norepinephrine in
patients with septic shock, dopamine increased arrhyth￾mic events and, in patients with cardiogenic shock,
increased the risk of death [146]. In patients with pri￾mary RV dysfunction (without PH) due to septic shock,
epinephrine improves RV contractility despite an 11%
increase in mPAP [14]. In animal studies, epinephrine
reduces the PVR/SVR more than does dopamine [147].
Isoproterenol has been used in RV failure primarily as a
chronotrope after cardiac transplantation [148], although
it may induce arrhythmias [149].
Dobutamine At clinical doses up to 5 μg/kg/min in heart
failure, dobutamine increases myocardial contractility,
reduces PVR and SVR, and induces less tachycardia than
does dopamine [143]. It improves RV performance in
patients with PH at liver transplantation [150], after RV
infarction [151], and is used in PAH exacerbations [152].
It is synergistic with NO in patients with PH [153].
Experimentally, dobutamine has favorable pulmonary
vascular effects at lower doses [44,154], although it leads
to increased PVR, tachycardia, and systemic hypotension
at doses exceeding 10 μg/kg/min [155]. Given the adverse
effects of systemic hypotension in these patients, it is
important to anticipate and treat it with vasopressors
when using dobutamine.
Inodilators
An inodilator increases myocardial contractility while
simultaneously causing systemic and pulmonary vaso￾dilatation. Inodilators include the phosphodiesterase
(PDE) III inhibitors and levosimendan.
PDE3 inhibitors Several types of PDE are recognized:
PDEIII usually deactivates intracellular cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP), and PDE3 inhibitors there￾fore increase cAMP and augment myocardial contracti￾lity while dilating the vasculature [156-158]. The
selective PDEIII inhibitors include enoximone, milri￾none, and amrinone. They are most suited to short￾term use because of tachyphylaxis [159], and mild
tachycardia is common. Milrinone is most frequently
used and has been shown to reduce pulmonary
pressures and augment RV function in many studies in
patients with pulmonary vascular dysfunction [160-164].
Enoximone improves RV function in pulmonary vascular
dysfunction after cardiac surgery [165,166] and in
patients with decompensated chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease (COPD) [167]. Enoximone leads to
fewer postoperative myocardial infarctions than does
dobutamine [168,169], which may relate to the result￾ing improved gas exchange when compared with dobu￾tamine and GTN [170]. Concerns regarding platelet
aggregation with amrinone [171] do not appear to
arise with enoximone [172] or milrinone after cardiac
surgery [173,174]. As with dobutamine, resulting rever￾sible systemic hypotension means that coadministra￾tion with pressors is often necessary. Agents such as
norepinephrine, phenylephrine or vasopressin are used,
with the latter reducing PVR/SVR more than norepi￾nephrine [115]. PDEIII inhibitors may also improve RV
function in chronic PH [175].
Nebulized milrinone is increasingly used to manage
PH crises in several settings [176-179]. Through pul￾monary selectivity, it results in less systemic hypotension
and less V/Q mismatch compared with intravenous use
in patients with PH after mitral valve replacement sur￾gery [177,178]. The combination of milrinone-AVP
reduces PVR/SVR and may be preferable to milrinone￾NE in RV dysfunction [115].
Levosimendan Levosimendan sensitizes troponin-C to
calcium and selectively inhibits PDE III, improving dia￾stolic function and myocardial contractility without
increasing oxygen consumption [180-183]. It also acts as
a vasodilator through calcium desensitization, potassium
channel opening, and PDEIII inhibition [184]. Levosi￾mendan leads to a rapid improvement in hemody￾namics, including reduction in PVR in patients with
decompensated heart failure [185], with significant bene￾fit on RV efficiency [182], with effects lasting several
days [186]. Levosimendan improves RV-PA coupling in
experimental acute RV failure [187-189] more than
dobutamine [188]. These effects have been shown clini￾cally with improvements in RV function and reduction
in PVR in ischemic RV failure [190-194], ARDS [195],
and after mitral valve replacement surgery [196,197]. In
chronic PH, repetitive doses reduce mPAP and PVR
from baseline and improve SvO2 [198].
GRADE RECOMMENDATION 4
Based on low-moderate-quality evidence (see Additional
file 1), a WEAK recommendation can be made that low￾dose dobutamine (up to 10 μg/kg/min) improves RV
function and may be useful in patients with pulmonary
vascular dysfunction, although it may reduce SVR.
Dopamine may increase tachyarrhythmias and is not
recommended in the setting of cardiogenic shock

(STRONG recommendation based on high-quality
evidence level).
GRADE RECOMMENDATION 5
Based on mostly moderate-quality evidence (see Addi￾tional file 1), a STRONG recommendation can be made
that PDE III inhibitors improve RV performance and
reduce PVR in patients with acute pulmonary vascular
dysfunction, although systemic hypotension is common,
usually requiring coadmininstration of pressors. Based
on low-quality evidence (see Additional file 1), a WEAK
recommendation can be made that inhaled milrinone
may be useful to minimize systemic hypotension and V/Q
mismatch in pulmonary vascular dysfunction.
GRADE RECOMMENDATION 6
Based on mostly low-quality evidence (see Additional
file 1), a WEAK recommendation can be made that
levosimendan may be considered for short-term
improvements in RV performance in patients with
biventricular heart failure.
Reduction of right ventricular afterload
Physiologic coupling between the RV and the pulmonary
circulation is a vital form of autoregulation of pulmonary
circulatory flow (Figure 2). The RV is even less tolerant
of acute changes in afterload than the LV, presumably
because of the lower myocardial muscle mass [199]. In
sepsis, a reduction in PVR will increase the RV ejection
fraction at no additional cost to cardiac output [47], but
at levels beyond moderate PH, LV filling may be reduced,
and ultimately cardiac output will decrease [199].
Measures to reduce RV afterload may be nonpharmaco￾logic (Table 3) or pharmacologic (Table 6).
Pulmonary vasodilator therapy
Specific pulmonary vasodilators may be useful both to
reduce RV afterload and to manipulate hypoxic vaso￾constriction in patients with severe hypoxia. Agents are
classically subdivided according to their action on the
cyclic GMP, prostacyclin, or endothelin pathways [200].
In the nonacute setting, these agents also target
remodeling of “resistance” pulmonary vessels and have

revolutionized the care of patients with PAH [201].
Importantly, however, the management with pulmonary
vasodilators in chronic PH patients differs in several
ways from that with acute pulmonary vascular dysfunc￾tion, notably in terms of rapid changes in RV volume
status, and potential adverse hemodynamic effects of
nonselective pulmonary vasodilators in unstable patients.
Pulmonary vasodilators should be used after optimiza￾tion of RV perfusion and CO. Systemic administration
of pulmonary vasodilators may reduce systemic blood
pressure [202], potentially reducing RV preload
and worsening RV ischemia [86]. Exclusion of a fixed
elevated pulmonary venous pressure is important, as
increased transpulmonary flow may precipitate pulmon￾ary edema [203,204]. Furthermore, nonselective actions
of vasodilators may result in worsening ventilation/
perfusion (V/Q) matching [205]. This risk is reduced
with the use of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, with
which the agent will reach vessels in only ventilated
lung units [206].
Adenosine
Adenosine increases intracellular cAMP via A2 receptor
agonism [207], and when administered intravenously,
acts as a potent selective pulmonary vasodilator because
of its rapid endothelial metabolism [208]. It has been
used as a therapy for adult PH in some settings, includ￾ing after cardiac surgery [209], but may elevate LV end￾diastolic pressure [210] and cause bradycardia and
bronchospasm [211]. It is currently therefore recom￾mended as an alternative to NO and prostacyclin in
dynamic vasoreactivity studies rather than as treatment
for PH [201].
Inhaled nitric oxide
Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is a potent pulmonary vasodi￾lator with a short half-life due to rapid inactivation by
hemoglobin. This minimizes systemic vasodilatation,
although it necessitates continuous delivery into
the ventilator circuit [206]. NO selectively reduces
PVR and improves CO in PAH [212], secondary PH
[205,213,214], acute PE [215,216], ischemic RV dysfunc￾tion [217,218], and postsurgical PH [202,219-234]. NO
also improves oxygenation [235], RVEF, and reduces
vasopressor requirements in PH after cardiac surgery
[236], especially in patients with higher baseline PVR
[237], with no augmented effect seen at doses above 10
ppm in these patients [238]. Use of NO (or inhaled
PGI2) after mitral valve replacement surgery results in
easier weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and
shorter ICU stays [239,240].
NO has been shown to reduce PVR and improve CO
in several studies in patients with acute RV failure due
to ARDS [79,241-246] and to improve oxygenation at
lower doses than the RV effects [247]. Administration of
NO does need to be continuous for PVR reduction, and
a potential exists for worsening oxygenation at excessive
doses [248]. The reduction in RV afterload, however,
does not correlate with clinical-outcome benefits
[249-251]. Similarly, despite short-term improvements
in oxygenation in ARDS [252], no studies show
a survival benefit [249,250,253-257].
NO provides synergistic pulmonary vasodilatation with
intravenous prostacyclin [258], inhaled iloprost [259],
and oral sildenafil [260,261]. Limitations include accu￾mulation of toxic metabolites, although this is not
usually a clinically significant problem [206]. Rebound
PH with RV dysfunction may occur after weaning from
NO [262-264], which may be reduced with PDE5 inhibi￾tors [265-270].
Prostanoids
Prostanoids include prostaglandin-I2 (prostacyclin, PGI2)
and its analogues, (iloprost) and prostaglandin-E1
(alprostadil, PGE1). An important difference between
their formulations is their resulting half-life (Table 6).
Prostacyclin is a potent systemic and pulmonary vasodi￾lator, with antiplatelet [271] and antiproliferative effects
[272]. In PAH, these agents reduce PVR, increase CO,
and improve clinical outcomes [273-279], and are used
in patients with NYHA III-IV symptoms [201].
The use of prostanoids is most commonly described
in ICU after cardiac surgery or transplantation. Intrave￾nous prostacyclin [18,280], PGE1 [281-285], inhaled
prostacyclin [223,286-290], and iloprost [291-297] all
reduce PVR and improve RV performance in these set￾tings, with inhaled agents being most selective. Intrave￾nous PGE1 may cause marked desaturation in patients
with lung disease [205]. Inhaled prostacyclin has short￾term equivalence to NO [226], and inhaled iloprost has
been shown to be even more effective than NO at
acutely reducing PVR and augmenting CO in PH after
CPB [298] and in PAH [277]. Inhaled PGI2 also acutely
improves pulmonary hemodynamics after acute massive
PE [299]. Although PGI2 impairs platelet aggregation,
clinical bleeding was not increased in one study [300].
The potential anticoagulant effect should be remem￾bered, however, especially in patients after surgery and
receiving concomitant heparin.
In ARDS, intravenous prostacyclin reduces PVR and
improves RV function, although it may increase intra￾pulmonary shunt [301]. Inhaled prostacyclin [302-305]
and inhaled PGE1 [306] improve oxygenation and
reduce PVR in ARDS, with minimal effects on SVR. NO
and intravenous PGI2 have been combined in ARDS
with effective reduction of PVR without adverse effects
[307].
PDE5 inhibitors
PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil and vardenafil,
increase downstream cGMP signaling, potentiating the
beneficial effects of NO (Figure 4). PDE5 inhibitors
Price et al. Critical Care 2010, 14:R169
http://ccforum.com/content/14/5/R169

acutely reduce PVR [308,309], and increase CO and
reduce PAOP more than does NO [310]. These agents
improve clinical end-points in PAH [311], where
endothelial NO is reduced [312] and PDE5 expression is
upregulated [313,314]. PDE5 inhibitor may also exert
milrinone-like effects through PDEIII inhibition, aug￾menting RV function [310,311,315]. Despite their rela￾tive pulmonary selectivity and rapid onset, however,
adverse effects may include reduced SVR with potential
effects on RV performance [316]. Oral sildenafil has
been used to reduce PVR effectively in well-selected
patients with PH after cardiac surgery without reducing
the SVR [269,317-319]. Even a single dose may facilitate
weaning from NO [266], also without reducing SVR
[266-269]. Sildenafil may also improve myocardial perfu￾sion and reduce platelet activation [320] as well as
endothelial dysfunction after CPB [321]. Oral sildenafil
has been effective in patients with PH due to left ventri￾cular systolic dysfunction, reducing PVR and increasing
CO, although reducing the SVR [260]. Sildenafil has also
been used in selected patients with PH due to selected
cases of chronic respiratory disease without worsening
oxygenation or SVR [322,323]. A single dose of 50 mg
nasogastric sildenafil has been studied in a small cohort
of consecutive ARDS patients, lowering MAP, and
worsening oxygenation due to increased V/Q mismatch,
although RV performance did improve [324]. Intrave￾nous sildenafil has been shown to reduce SVR and PVR
in end-stage congestive heart failure patients [325],
although it is not available commercially, and its use is
not licensed in unstable patients (Table 6).
GRADE RECOMMENDATION 7
Based on mostly moderate-quality evidence (see Addi￾tional file 1), the following STRONG recommendation
is made: pulmonary vasodilators reduce PVR, improve
CO and oxygenation, and may be useful when PH and
RV dysfunction are present, notably after cardiac
surgery.
Based on mostly moderate-quality evidence (see Addi￾tional file 1), the ICU side-effect profile of intravenous
pulmonary vasodilators may be less favorable than that of
inhaled agents. The following STRONG recommendation
is therefore made: Consideration should be given to the
use of inhaled rather than systemic agents when systemic
hypotension is likely, and concomitant vasopressor use
should be anticipated.
Based on mostly high-quality evidence (see Additional
file 1), the following STRONG recommendation is
made: give consideration for the use of NO as a short￾term therapy to improve oxygenation indices but not
outcome in patients with ARDS. Based on low-quality
evidence (see Additional file 1), a WEAK recommenda￾tion is made that pulmonary vasodilators may also be
useful treat PH associated with RV dysfunction in
ARDS.
Based on mostly low-quality evidence (see Additional
file 1), the following WEAK recommendation is made:
Oral sildenafil may reduce PVR and facilitate weaning
from NO after cardiac surgery in selected patients with
PH, without adverse effects on systemic blood pressure
in well-selected patients.
Nonpharmacologic Management
This encompasses RV “protective” strategies to avoid
factors (Table 3) that may further increase PVR.
Mechanical devices are also increasingly used to give a
failing RV a bridge to recovery or transplantation.
Ventilatory strategies
Important variables that may reduce pulmonary blood
flow during ventilation include hypoxia, hypercapnia,
and compression of the pulmonary vasculature at the
extremes of lung volumes (Figure 4). Acute hypoxia
leading to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is well
described [326] and may be augmented by many factors,
including acidosis [327]. Acute hypercapnia also leads to
pulmonary vasoconstriction [328,329], although this may
be attenuated with NO [330], and, when associated with
Figure 4 Increased PVR at extremes of lung volumes. This figure
represents measurements made in an animal-lobe preparation in
which the transmural pressure of the capillaries is held constant. It
illustrates that at low lung volumes (as may occur with atelectasis),
extraalveolar vessels become narrow, and smooth muscle and
elastic fibers in these collapsed vessels increase PVR. At high lung
volumes, as alveolar volumes are increased and walls are thinned,
capillaries are stretched, reducing their caliber and also increasing
PVR. (Adapted from John West’s Essential Physiology, 10th edition,
Philadelphia: Lippincott & Williams, with permission).

high PEEP, leads to RV dilatation and reduced cardiac
output in severe ARDS [328,329]. A reduction in pul￾monary blood flow occurs both at low volumes, such as
in areas of atelectasis, and at high lung volumes, such as
with increased airway plateau pressure (Pplat): Increased
RV afterload, reduced venous return, and acute RV dys￾function may result [331]. Both atelectasis and ventila￾tion at high lung volumes should therefore be avoided
in patients with RV dysfunction.
Before the era of protective ventilatory strategies in
ARDS, the incidence of acute RV failure was 60% [332]
and has since decreased to 10% to 25% [24]. This is
thought to reflect the change in ventilatory practice:
lower Pplat reduces the incidence of RV failure [333].
Prone ventilation may also reduce Pplat and pCO2 suffi￾ciently to improve acute RV failure [334]. In ARDS,
transition to high-frequency oscillation leads to an
increase in CVP and a minor decrease in cardiac output
due to preload reduction [335], and RV function may
decrease during recruitment maneuvers [336]. In chil￾dren after Fontan procedures, the hemodynamic effects
of negative-pressure ventilation (NPV) are nicely illu￾strated by measuring pulmonary blood flow: after a
switch from conventional intermittent positive pressure
ventilation (IPPV) to NPV by using cuirass ventilation,
pulmonary blood flow, stroke volume, and cardiac out￾put increased up to 50%, and decreased to baseline
when IPPV was reinstituted [337,338].
Mechanical support
Mechanical support for the RV may be appropriate in
reversible settings or as a bridge to definitive treat￾ment. RV-assist devices (RVADs) may be used in pri￾mary RV dysfunction [339] and have been used with
coexisting PH [340,341]. There is, however, concern
that pulsatile devices may cause pulmonary microcir￾culatory damage in PH [342,343]. A pumpless “lung
assist” device has been used in patients bridging to
transplant [344]. Extracorporeal membrane oxygena￾tion (ECMO) has been used in severe PH [345-348], as
a bridge to transplant [349,350], and after endarterect￾omy [351] or massive PE [352-355]. Intraaortic balloon
counterpulsation (IABP) has been used for RV failure
after CPB [356] and transplantation [357], thought to
improve CO by augmenting left coronary flow rather
than by direct RV effects [358]. Atrial septostomy cre￾ates a right-to-left shunt that improves left atrial filling
and LV function while reducing RV end-diastolic pres￾sure and improving RV contractility. It is sometimes
used as a bridge to transplantation in severe PAH
[359], although not in patients with very severe RV
failure [360].
GRADE RECOMMENDATION 8
Based on mostly very-low-quality evidence, the following
WEAK recommendation is made: Mechanical therapies
including ECMO and IABP may have a role as rescue
therapies in reversible pulmonary vascular dysfunction
or while awaiting definitive treatment.
Conclusions
Pulmonary vascular and right ventricular dysfunction
may complicate many ICU illnesses: the diagnosis may
be difficult, and the acute management, challenging.
Their presence is associated with a worse outcome. This
review highlights that some recommendations can be
made, despite limitations of the GRADE analysis. How￾ever, we do consider that “weak GRADE recommenda￾tions” could be interpreted as “management suggestions”
and treated with appropriate caution. A further limita￾tion is that several pathologies have been grouped
together as one syndrome, although this relates to both
the rarity of the syndrome and the lack of high-quality
evidence: further research is desperately needed. In parti￾cular, only then will we learn whether PAH-targeted
therapy such as use of PDE5 inhibitors or endothelin￾receptor antagonists, so effective in idiopathic PAH, have
a role in the ICU setting.
Key messages
• Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and associated right
ventricular (RV) failure are associated with worse
outcomes in critical care, and because of nonspecific
presenting symptoms and signs, may be difficult to
recognize: echocardiography is a very useful initial
test, and invasive monitoring may be helpful in some
cases for more continuous monitoring and accurate
measurement of pulmonary vascular resistance.
• Volume loading of the right ventricle may worsen
its performance: all fluid challenges should be closely
monitored.
• It is essential to maintain adequate aortic root
pressure to prevent the onset of RV ischemia. Vaso￾pressors are useful in this setting, including low-dose
norepinephrine as a first-line agent. Low-dose vaso￾pressin may also be useful in some resistant cases
but has adverse myocardial effects at higher doses.
Potentially useful inotropes in RV failure include
dobutamine and those with additional pulmonary
vasodilating effects, including PDE III inhibitors,
although co-administration with pressors is often
necessary. The effects of any vasoactive drug may be
unpredictable in an individual and require close clin￾ical observation of circulatory performance, poten￾tially assisted by echocardiography.

• Pulmonary vasodilators are useful to reduce RV
afterload in several ICU settings, including PH and
RV failure after cardiac surgery. Systemic adminis￾tration may worsen systemic hemodynamics and
oxygenation because of ventilation-perfusion
mismatching.
• The use of mechanical therapies to manage acute
PH and enhance RV performance is expanding,
although with evidence currently limited to case
series, and may be useful in experienced centers to
ameliorate RV failure while awaiting definitive
therapy.
