"Over the last few years, we have published our research regularly
in Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research. Having published in
more than 20 high impact journals over the last five years including
several high impact ones and reviewing articles for even more
journals across my fields of interest, we value our published work in
JCDR for their high standards in publishing scientific articles. The
ease of submission, the rapid reviews in under a month, the high
quality of their reviewers and keen attention to the final process of
proofs and publication, ensure that there are no mistakes in the
final article. We have been asked clarifications on several occasions
and have been happy to provide them and it exemplifies the


commitment to quality of the team at JCDR."

"Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research is at present a well-
known Indian originated scientific journal which started with a
humble beginning. I have been associated with this journal since
many years. I appreciate the Editor, Dr. Hemant Jain, for his
constant effort in bringing up this journal to the present status right
from the scratch. The journal is multidisciplinary. It encourages in
publishing the scientific articles from postgraduates and also the
beginners who start their career. At the same time the journal also
caters for the high quality articles from specialty and super-
specialty researchers. Hence it provides a platform for the scientist
and researchers to publish. The other aspect of it is, the readers get
the information regarding the most recent developments in science
which can be used for teaching, research, treating patients and to
some extent take preventive measures against certain diseases. The
journal is contributing immensely to the society at national and
international level."

Research provides an opportunity to researchers, scientists and
budding professionals to explore the developments in the field of
medicine and dentistry and their varied specialities, thus extending
our view on biological diversities of living species in relation to
medicine.
�Knowledge is treasure of a wise man.� The free access of this
journal provides an immense scope of learning for the both the old

of article in various categories is really praiseworthy.
Their prompt and timely response to review's query and the manner
in which they have set the reviewing process helps in extracting the
best possible scientific writings for publication.
It's a honour and pride to be a part of the JCDR team. My very best

" Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (JCDR) is a multi-
specialty medical and dental journal publishing high quality
research articles in almost all branches of medicine. The quality of
printing of figures and tables is excellent and comparable to any
International journal. An added advantage is nominal publication
charges and monthly issue of the journal and more chances of an
article being accepted for publication. Moreover being a multi-
specialty journal an article concerning a particular specialty has a
wider reach of readers of other related specialties also. As an author
and reviewer for several years I find this Journal most suitable and
highly recommend this Journal."

"Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (JCDR) is a reputed
peer reviewed journal and is constantly involved in publishing high
quality research articles related to medicine. Its been a great
pleasure to be associated with this esteemed journal as a reviewer
and as an author for a couple of years. The editorial board consists
of many dedicated and reputed experts as its members and they are
doing an appreciable work in guiding budding researchers. JCDR is
doing a commendable job in scientific research by promoting
excellent quality research & review articles and case reports &
series. The reviewers provide appropriate suggestions that improve
the quality of articles. I strongly recommend my fraternity to
encourage JCDR by contributing their valuable research work in
this widely accepted, user friendly journal. I hope my collaboration
with JCDR will continue for a long time".

"It gives me great pleasure to be associated with JCDR, since last
2-3 years. Since then I have authored, co-authored and reviewed
about 25 articles in JCDR. I thank JCDR for giving me an
opportunity to improve my own skills as an author and a reviewer.


It 's a multispecialty journal, publishing high quality articles. It
gives a platform to the authors to publish their research work which
can be available for everyone across the globe to read. The best
thing about JCDR is that the full articles of all medical specialties
are available as pdf/html for reading free of cost or without
institutional subscription, which is not there for other journals. For
those who have problem in writing manuscript or do statistical
work, JCDR comes for their rescue.
The journal has a monthly publication and the articles are
published quite fast. In time compared to other journals. The on-
line first publication is also a great advantage and facility to review
one's own articles before going to print. The response to any query
and permission if required, is quite fast; this is quite commendable.
I have a very good experience about seeking quick permission for
quoting a photograph (Fig.) from a JCDR article for my chapter
authored in an E book. I never thought it would be so easy. No
hassles.
Reviewing articles is no less a pain staking process and requires in
depth perception, knowledge about the topic for review. It requires
time and concentration, yet I enjoy doing it. The JCDR website
especially for the reviewers is quite user friendly. My suggestions
for improving the journal is, more strict review process, so that only
high quality articles are published. I find a a good number of
articles in Obst. Gynae, hence, a new journal for this specialty titled
JCDR-OG can be started. May be a bimonthly or quarterly
publication to begin with. Only selected articles should find a place
in it.
An yearly reward for the best article authored can also incentivize
the authors. Though the process of finding the best article will be
not be very easy. I do not know how reviewing process can be
improved. If an article is being reviewed by two reviewers, then
opinion of one can be communicated to the other or the final
opinion of the editor can be communicated to the reviewer if
requested for. This will help one�s reviewing skills.
My best wishes to Dr. Hemant Jain and all the editorial staff of
JCDR for their untiring efforts to bring out this journal. I strongly
recommend medical fraternity to publish their valuable research
work in this esteemed journal, JCDR".

Dr. Rajendra Kumar Ghritlaharey
"I wish to thank Dr. Hemant Jain, Editor-in-Chief Journal of Clinical
and Diagnostic Research (JCDR), for asking me to write up few
words.
Writing is the representation of language in a textual medium i e;
into the words and sentences on paper. Quality medical manuscript
writing in particular, demands not only a high-quality research, but
also requires accurate and concise communication of findings and
conclusions, with adherence to particular journal guidelines. In
medical field whether working in teaching, private, or in corporate
institution, everyone wants to excel in his / her own field and get
recognised by making manuscripts publication.
Authors are the souls of any journal, and deserve much respect. To
publish a journal manuscripts are needed from authors. Authors
have a great responsibility for producing facts of their work in
terms of number and results truthfully and an individual honesty is
expected from authors in this regards. Both ways its true "No
authors-No manuscripts-No journals" and "No journals�No
manuscripts�No authors". Reviewing a manuscript is also a very
responsible and important task of any peer-reviewed journal and to
be taken seriously. It needs knowledge on the subject, sincerity,
honesty and determination. Although the process of reviewing a
manuscript is a time consuming task butit is expected to give one's
best remarks within the time frame of the journal.
Salient features of the JCDR: It is a biomedical, multidisciplinary
(including all medical and dental specialities), e-journal, with wide
scope and extensive author support. At the same time, a free text of
manuscript is available in HTML and PDF format. There is fast
growing authorship and readership with JCDR as this can be judged
by the number of articles published in it i e; in Feb 2007 of its first


issue, it contained 5 articles only, and now in its recent volume
published in April 2011, it contained 67 manuscripts. This e-journal
is fulfilling the commitments and objectives sincerely, (as stated by
Editor-in-chief in his preface to first edition) i e; to encourage
physicians through the internet, especially from the developing
countries who witness a spectrum of disease and acquire a wealth of
knowledge to publish their experiences to benefit the medical
community in patients care. I also feel that many of us have work of
substance, newer ideas, adequate clinical materials but poor in
medical writing and hesitation to submit the work and need help.
JCDR provides authors help in this regards.
Timely publication of journal: Publication of manuscripts and
bringing out the issue in time is one of the positive aspects of JCDR
and is possible with strong support team in terms of peer reviewers,
proof reading, language check, computer operators, etc. This is one
of the great reasons for authors to submit their work with JCDR.
Another best part of JCDR is "Online first Publications" facilities
available for the authors. This facility not only provides the prompt
publications of the manuscripts but at the same time also early
availability of the manuscripts for the readers.
Indexation and online availability: Indexation transforms the
journal in some sense from its local ownership to the worldwide
professional community and to the public.JCDR is indexed with
Embase & EMbiology, Google Scholar, Index Copernicus, Chemical
Abstracts Service, Journal seek Database, Indian Science Abstracts,
to name few of them. Manuscriptspublished in JCDR are available
on major search engines ie; google, yahoo, msn.
In the era of fast growing newer technologies, and in computer and
internet friendly environment the manuscripts preparation,
submission, review, revision, etc and all can be done and checked
with a click from all corer of the world, at any time. Of course there
is always a scope for improvement in every field and none is
perfect. To progress, one needs to identify the areas of one's
weakness and to strengthen them.
It is well said that "happy beginning is half done" and it fits
perfectly with JCDR. It has grown considerably and I feel it has
already grown up from its infancy to adolescence, achieving the
status of standard online e-journal form Indian continent since its
inception in Feb 2007. This had been made possible due to the
efforts and the hard work put in it. The way the JCDR is improving


with every new volume, with good quality original manuscripts,
makes it a quality journal for readers. I must thank and
congratulate Dr Hemant Jain, Editor-in-Chief JCDR and his team for
their sincere efforts, dedication, and determination for making
JCDR a fast growing journal.
Every one of us: authors, reviewers, editors, and publisher are
responsible for enhancing the stature of the journal. I wish for a
great success for JCDR."
Thanking you

Dr. Shankar P.R.
"On looking back through my Gmail archives after being requested
by the journal to write a short editorial about my experiences of
publishing with the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research
(JCDR), I came across an e-mail from Dr. Hemant Jain, Editor, in
March 2007, which introduced the new electronic journal. The
main features of the journal which were outlined in the e-mail were
extensive author support, cash rewards, the peer review process,
and other salient features of the journal.
Over a span of over four years, we (I and my colleagues) have
published around 25 articles in the journal. In this editorial, I plan
to briefly discuss my experiences of publishing with JCDR and the
strengths of the journal and to finally address the areas for
improvement.
My experiences of publishing with JCDR: Overall, my experiences


of publishing withJCDR have been positive. The best point about
the journal is that it responds to queries from the author. This may
seem to be simple and not too much to ask for, but unfortunately,
many journals in the subcontinent and from many developing
countries do not respond or they respond with a long delay to the
queries from the authors 1. The reasons could be many, including
lack of optimal secretarial and other support. Another problem with
many journals is the slowness of the review process. Editorial
processing and peer review can take anywhere between a year to
two years with some journals. Also, some journals do not keep the
contributors informed about the progress of the review process. Due
to the long review process, the articles can lose their relevance and
topicality. A major benefit with JCDR is the timeliness and
promptness of its response. In Dr Jain's e-mail which was sent to me
in 2007, before the introduction of the Pre-publishing system, he
had stated that he had received my submission and that he would
get back to me within seven days and he did!
Most of the manuscripts are published within 3 to 4 months of their
submission if they are found to be suitable after the review process.
JCDR is published bimonthly and the accepted articles were usually
published in the next issue. Recently, due to the increased volume
of the submissions, the review process has become slower and it ??
Section can take from 4 to 6 months for the articles to be reviewed.
The journal has an extensive author support system and it has
recently introduced a paid expedited review process. The journal
also mentions the average time for processing the manuscript under
different submission systems - regular submission and expedited
review.
Strengths of the journal: The journal has an online first facility in
which the accepted manuscripts may be published on the website
before being included in a regular issue of the journal. This cuts
down the time between their acceptance and the publication. The
journal is indexed in many databases, though not in PubMed. The
editorial board should now take steps to index the journal in
PubMed. The journal has a system of notifying readers through e-
mail when a new issue is released. Also, the articles are available in
both the HTML and the PDF formats. I especially like the new and
colorful page format of the journal. Also, the access statistics of the
articles are available. The prepublication and the manuscript
tracking system are also helpful for the authors.


Areas for improvement: In certain cases, I felt that the peer review
process of the manuscripts was not up to international standards
and that it should be strengthened. Also, the number of manuscripts
in an issue is high and it may be difficult for readers to go through
all of them. The journal can consider tightening of the peer review
process and increasing the quality standards for the acceptance of
the manuscripts. I faced occasional problems with the online
manuscript submission (Pre-publishing) system, which have to be
addressed.
Overall, the publishing process with JCDR has been smooth, quick
and relatively hassle free and I can recommend other authors to
consider the journal as an outlet for their work."
