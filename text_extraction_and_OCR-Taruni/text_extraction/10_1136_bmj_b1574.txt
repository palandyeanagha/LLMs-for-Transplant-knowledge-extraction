ABSTRACT
Objective To summarise the evidence for early extubation
with immediate application of non-invasive ventilation
compared with continued invasive weaning on important
outcomes in intubated adults with respiratory failure.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of
randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials.
Setting Intensive care units.
Participants Critically ill adults receiving invasive
ventilation.
Study selection criteria We searched Medline, Embase,
and CENTRAL, proceedings from four conferences, and
reference lists of relevant studies to identify relevant
trials. Two reviewers independently selected trials,
assessed trial quality, and abstracted data.
Results We identified 12 trials enrolling 530 participants,
mostly with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Compared with invasive weaning, non-invasive weaning
was significantly associated with reduced mortality
(relative risk 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 0.79),
ventilator associated pneumonia (0.29, 95% 0.19 to
0.45), length of stay in intensive care unit (weighted mean
difference −6.27 days, −8.77 to −3.78) and hospital (−7.
19 days, −10.80 to −3.58), total duration of ventilation,
and duration of invasive ventilation. Non-invasive
weaning had no effect on weaning failures or weaning
time. Benefits on mortality and weaning failures were
non-significantly greater in trials that exclusively enrolled
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
versus mixed populations.
Conclusions Current trials in critically ill adults show a
consistent positive effect of non-invasive weaning on
mortality and ventilator associated pneumonia, though
the net clinical benefits remain to be fully elucidated.
Non-invasive ventilation should preferentially be used in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a
highly monitored environment.
INTRODUCTION
Patients with respiratory failure often require mechan￾ical ventilation to unload the respiratory muscles and
support gas exchange until the pathophysiology lead￾ing to respiratory failure improves. Invasive ventila￾tion maintains a patent airway but when used over a
prolonged period of time might lead to ventilator asso￾ciated pneumonia.1 This, in turn, is associated with
increased morbidity and trends towards increased
mortality.2 For these reasons, clinicians caring for
patients who need invasive ventilation strive to reduce
the duration of invasive ventilation while optimising
the chance for successful extubation.3
Non-invasive ventilation provides an alternative
method of supporting a patient’s respiration by using
positive pressure ventilation with either an oronasal,
nasal, or total face mask at the patient-ventilator inter￾face. Non-invasive ventilation preserves the patient’s
ability to speak and cough4 and has been shown to
reduce complications related to intubation, especially
ventilator associated pneumonia.5 6 Similar to invasive
ventilation, non-invasive ventilation can reduce the fre￾quency of breathing, augment tidal volume, improve
gas exchange, and rest the muscles of respiration.7 8
Non-invasive ventilation has been widely investigated
as an initial treatment to prevent intubation and intuba￾tion related complications and improve clinical out￾comes in selected patients.9 10 Many patients with
severe respiratory failure, impaired sensorium, haemo￾dynamic instability, or difficulty clearing secretions,
however, undergo direct intubation or intubation after
a failed attempt at non-invasive ventilation.
To mitigate the effect of complications associated
with protracted invasive ventilation, investigators
have explored the role of non-invasive ventilation in
weaning patients from invasive ventilation. Non-inva￾sive weaning involves extubating patients directly to
non-invasive ventilation for the purpose of weaning
to reduce the duration of invasive ventilation and, con￾sequently, complications related to intubation. Since
Udwadia and colleagues published the first report
describing use of non-invasive ventilation to facilitate
liberation of patients with weaning failure from inva￾sive ventilation in 1992,11 several uncontrolled, pro￾spective studies,12-15 early randomised controlled
trials,w1-w5 and an early meta-analysis16 have examined
its use to facilitate weaning. That meta-analysis showed
significant benefit of the non-invasive approach on
length of stay in hospital and the total duration of ven￾tilation. Non-invasive weaning also reduced mortality

and ventilator associated pneumonia compared with
invasive weaning, however there were few events.
In light of new evidence we critically appraised, sum￾marised, and updated current work on the effect of
non-invasive weaning compared with invasive wean￾ing on the primary outcome of mortality and second￾ary outcomes including ventilator associated
pneumonia, length of stay in intensive care and in hos￾pital, and duration of ventilator support in critically ill
mechanically ventilated adults.
METHODS
Data sources and searches
We updated a previously conducted search of Medline
(January 1966-April 2008), Embase (January 1980-
April 2008), and the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2008)
without language restrictions. Details of the search
strategy and terms are available from the authors.
Two reviewers (KEAB, NKJA) screened citation titles
and abstracts independently. All potentially eligible
studies were retrieved in full and translated into Eng￾lish, as required. One reviewer (SPK) updated manual
searches of abstracts from intensive care conference
proceedings published in the American Journal of
Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Intensive Care Med￾icine, Critical Care Medicine, and Chest from January
2003 to April 2008. We reviewed bibliographies of
all retrieved articles to identify potentially relevant
trials and contacted authors of included studies to iden￾tify unpublished studies and obtain additional informa￾tion regarding study methods, where needed.
Study selection
We included randomised trials that enrolled adults
with respiratory failure who required invasive
mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours. The trials
examined extubation with immediate application of
non-invasive ventilation compared with continued
invasive weaning. We included trials reporting at
least one of mortality (primary outcome), ventilator
associated pneumonia, weaning failure (using authors’
definitions), length of stay in intensive care or hospital,
total duration of ventilation (invasive and non-inva￾sive), duration of ventilation related to weaning (after
randomisation), duration of invasive ventilation,
adverse events, or quality of life. We also included
quasi-randomised controlled trials—for example,
those that allocated patients by hospital registry num￾ber or day of the week. We excluded studies that com￾pared non-invasive with invasive weaning in the
immediate postoperative setting, compared non-inva￾sive ventilation with unassisted oxygen supplementa￾tion, and investigated use of non-invasive ventilation
after unplanned extubation. Two authors (KEAB,
NKJA) independently selected articles meeting the
inclusion criteria.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two authors (KEAB, NKJA), not blinded to the source
of the reports, used a standardised data abstraction
form to independently abstract data regarding study
methods (randomisation, allocation concealment,
cointerventions, blinded outcome assessment, com￾pleteness of follow-up, and adherence to the intention
to treat principle). Additionally, we assessed features
unique to the design and implementation of weaning
trials, including use of daily screening to identify wean￾ing candidates, criteria to identify weaning readiness,
explicit weaning protocols (both groups), criteria for
discontinuing mechanical ventilation (both groups),
and reintubation. Disagreements regarding study
selection and data abstraction were resolved by con￾sensus and arbitration with a third author (SPK or
MM).
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
When there were no compelling differences in study
populations, interventions, and outcomes we pooled
data across studies using random effects models.17
We derived summary estimates of relative risk and
weighted mean difference with 95% confidence inter￾vals for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively,
using ReviewManager 4.2.10 software (Cochrane Col￾laboration, Oxford). If an outcome was reported at two
different time points, we included the more protracted
measure in pooled analyses.
We determined the presence and impact of statistical
heterogeneity among studies using the Cochran Q
statistic18 (threshold P<0.10)19 and the I2 test20 21 (with
threshold values of 0-40%, 30-60%, 50-90%, and ≥75%
representing heterogeneity that might not be impor￾tant or might represent moderate, substantial, or con￾siderable heterogeneity, respectively).22 In sensitivity
analyses, we assessed the impact of excluding quasi￾New citations reviewed (n=1368)

randomised trials on mortality and ventilator asso￾ciated pneumonia. We planned subgroup analyses to
compare the effects of non-invasive weaning on mor￾tality and weaning failures in exclusively chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease compared with non￾chronic populations and on mortality in studies that
enrolled ≥50% versus <50% patients with COPD. We
used random effects models for sensitivity and sub￾group analyses and assessed for differences between
subgroups in summary estimates using a z test for inter￾action.
We assessed for publication bias in mortality by
visually inspecting the corresponding forest plot. Post
hoc, we conducted additional pooled analyses of mor￾tality at various time points to assess the robustness of
the results.
RESULTS
Trial identification
We identified 12 randomised trials,w1-w12 including one
quasi-randomised trial,w4 that met our inclusion cri￾teria. Of these, fivew1-w5 were included in a previous
systematic review and meta-analysis.16 We excluded
nine trials,w13-w21 including three new trialsw19-w21
(fig 1). The seven newly identified trials included
three publications in Chinese,w7-w9 one abstract publi￾cation,w6 two additional publications,w10 w11 and one
unpublished dissertationw12 (all in English). Of the pre￾viously identified trials, one was published in abstract
formw3 and one trial was published in Chinese.w4 In
total, eight trials evaluated exclusively patient with
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasew1 w4 w6-w10 w12
and four included mixed patients.w2 w3 w5 w11 Patients
were considered difficult to wean in one studyw2 and
as persistent weaning failures in another study.w5 Four
studiesw7-w10 evaluated patients with chronic obstruc￾tive pulmonary disease with pulmonary infection
(table 1). The two reviewers (KEAB, NKJA) achieved
complete agreement on study selection.
Initial management
Initial pre-randomisation ventilation strategies predomi￾nantly entailed volume-cycled ventilationw1 w2 w4 w5 w6 w7
w9 w10 w12 with or without the concurrent or subsequent
use of pressure support. In three trials, screening for
weaning eligibility occurred dailyw3 w5 w6 or daily after
48 hours of invasive ventilation.w2 Alternatively, candi￾dates for weaning were identified after at least 24
hours,w12 36-48 hours (including 6-8 hours of para￾lysis),w1 48 hours,w2 48-60 hours,w4 72 hours (including
6-8 hours of paralysis),w6 or three daysw5 of invasive ven￾tilation. Eligibility for study inclusion was based on
meeting predefined criteria for readiness for weaningw1
w2 w4-w12 and failure of either a single 30 minute,w3 w11 one
hour,w1 or two hourw2 w6 w12T-piece trial, or failure of two
hour T-piece trials on three consecutive days.w5
Four studies,w7-w10 evaluating patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary infec￾tion, enrolled patients after control of infection was
achievedw7 or when they met pulmonary infection con￾trol criteria.w8-w10 In most trials these criteria included an
improving radiograph, improvement in temperature,

improvement in white blood cell count (or percentage
of neutrophils), and reduced volume and tenacity of
secretions,w7-w10 with improved haemodynamics,
cough, and level of consciousnessw7 w9 or reduced venti￾lator settings.w10
Invasive weaning
Patients in the control groups were variably weaned
with pressure support,w1-w6 w8 w12 assist control,w5 or
synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation with
pressure support.w7 w9 w10 The level of support was gra￾dually decreased in two studiesw1 w5 and trials of spon￾taneous breathing, using T-piece or continuous
positive airway pressure of less than 5 cm H2O, were
performed twice dailyw1 or dailyw5 w11 until extubation.
One study included at least two observation periods
per day during pressure support weaning with optional
trials of spontaneous breathing.w2 One study each
titrated pressure support either by 2 cm H2O every
four hours according to clinical tolerance, saturations,
and respiratory ratew12 or by 2-4 cm H2O per day.w6
Patients were considered weaned when they remained
stable for at least four hours with a synchronised inter￾mittent mandatory ventilation rate of 5 breaths/minute
with pressure support of 5-7 cm H2Ow10; blood gases
were normalised, and patients could breathe sponta￾neously for more than three hours with low oxygen
requirements (fractional concentration of inspired
oxygen (FiO2) ≤0.40), acceptable saturations (pulse
oximetry saturation (SpO2) ≥90%), and a normal pH
(pH ≥7.35)w7; or when pressure support was titrated to
≤8 cm H2O w8 or ≤10 cm H2Ow9 w12 with positive end
expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O,w12 and satisfactory

w12 tidal volume (about 8 ml/kg body weight),w8 w9
and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2,
between 45 and 60 mm Hg or at baseline levels) on
low FiO2
w8 w9 w12 for more than four hours.w8 w9 To dis￾continue invasive ventilation, patients successfully
completed a spontaneous breathing trial of either two
hours,w3 w5 three hours,w1 w4 w7 or unspecified dura￾tion,w11 or two periods of observation with optional
spontaneous breathing trials.w2
Non-invasive weaning
Similar to invasive weaning, trials applied different
protocols for non-invasive weaning. After extubation,
in 11 studies non-invasive ventilation was adminis￾tered in pressure mode,w1-w5 w7-w12 of which five speci￾fied a spontaneous timed modew2 w3 w5 w9 w12 or flow
mode.w2 Another study used proportional assist venti￾lation in timed mode.w6 Non-invasive ventilation was
delivered by face maskw1-w3 w5 w6 w8-w12 or nasal mask.w2
w3 w5 w6 w8 w9 Initial support was delivered continuously
in five studies,w1 w3-w5 w12 intermittently in one study,w2
for at least two hours during the initial application in
one study,w9 or until tolerated for 20-22 hours a day
(spaced by periods of spontaneous ventilation during
meals and for expectoration) in one study.w6 The level
of support was gradually decreased and the duration
on non-invasive ventilation gradually reduced.w8 w9
Some trials permitted fixed or gradually increasing
periods of spontaneous breathing,w1 w6 with at least
twow1 w6 specifying two periods of spontaneous breath￾ing a day. In some studies, clinicians titrated pressure
support by 2 cm H2O every four hoursw12 or by 2-4 cm
H2O each dayw6 according to the patient’s tolerance. In
some studies, clinicians decreased the level of inspira￾tory and expiratory positive airway pressure to 8 cm
and 4 cm H2O, respectively,w12 while in others, inspira￾tory pressure was reduced to <10 cm H2O (with non￾invasive ventilation applied for less than two hours a
day),w8 w9 or until the difference between inspiratory
and expiratory pressure (the equivalent of pressure
support) was <5 cm H2O.w10 Criteria for discontinuing
non-invasive support included successful completion
of a threew1 w4 or twow3 hour period of spontaneous

breathing or at least two periods of spontaneous
breathing observed by an attending physician.w2
Quality assessment
We contacted authors to confirm and supplement
information related to study methods where needed;
nine study authors responded.w1-w3 w5 w6 w9 w11 w12 Over￾all, the included studies were of moderate to high qual￾ity (table 2).
Primary outcome: mortality
All 12 trials (530 patients) provided mortality data,
reported at 30 days,w12 60 days,w1 90 days,w2 w5 at hos￾pital discharge,w6 w9-w11 or at an undefined time.w3 w4 w7
There was strong evidence that non-invasive weaning
was associated with reduced mortality (relative risk
0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 0.79, P=0.001),
with no heterogeneity (table 3, fig 2).
Secondary outcomes
Pooled data from 11 studies (509 patients)w1 w2 w4-w12
showed that non-invasive weaning was associated
with decreased ventilator associated pneumonia (rela￾tive risk 0.29, 0.19 to 0.45, P<0.001), with no hetero￾geneity (fig 3). Nine studies provided diagnostic
criteria for ventilator associated pneumonia.w1 w4 w5 w7-
w12 Meta-analyses also showed that patients under￾going non-invasive weaning had clinically and
statistically reduced length of stay in intensive care (6.
3 days) and hospital (7.2 days), total duration of
mechanical ventilation (5.6 days), and duration of inva￾sive ventilation (7.8 days), with significant heterogene￾ity. Non-invasive weaning had no effect on the
duration of mechanical ventilation related to weaning
or weaning failures, and no study reported on quality
of life.
Adverse events
Notwithstanding few events and wide confidence inter￾vals, the pooled results showed no difference in
arrhythmias (two studies, 63 patients) or reintubation
(six studies, 328 patients), and significantly fewer tra￾cheostomies (three studies, 141 patients) with non￾invasive weaning (table 3).
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses
Exclusion of a quasi-randomised trialw4 maintained the
significant reductions in mortality (relative risk 0.56,
0.39 to 0.81, P=0.002) and ventilator associated pneu￾monia (0.30, 0.20 to 0.47, P<0.001) in favour of non￾invasive weaning. We noted a non-significant benefi￾cial effect (z=−1.332; P=0.18) of non-invasive weaning
in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(eight studies) compared with mixed populations (four
studies) (0.42, 0.25 to 0.69, and 0.72, 0.39 to 1.32).

studies enrolling ≥50% (10 studies) versus <50% (two
studies) patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, we found a significant benefit of non-invasive
weaning on mortality in favour of studies enrolling pre￾dominantly patients with chronic obstructive pulmon￾ary disease (0.43, 0.28 to 0.65, and 1.15, 0.56 to 2.37; z=
−2.308; P=0.02). Similarly, we noted a non-significant
but greater effect of non-invasive weaning on weaning
failures in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (two studies) compared with mixed popula￾tions (two studies) (0.50, 0.22 to 1.12, and 1.28, 0.45
to 3.60, (z=−1.395; P=0.16).
Publication bias
Visual inspection of a funnel plot comparing the study
estimates of effect (relative risk) with the standard error
of the log relative risk of mortality showed asymmetry
and suggested the absence of studies with non-signifi￾cant results. The absence of such trials might overin￾flate the overall summary estimate of effect.22
DISCUSSION
In critically ills adults in intensive care non-invasive
weaning is associated with decreased mortality, venti￾lator associated pneumonia, length of stay in intensive
care and hospital, total duration of mechanical ventila￾tion, and duration of invasive ventilation. None of the
12 trials in our review reported quality of life out￾comes.
In their efforts to optimise the timing of liberation
from invasive ventilation, clinicians are challenged by
a trade-off between the risks associated with failed
extubation and the complications associated with pro￾longed invasive ventilation.23 Non-invasive weaning,
by providing ventilatory support without an artificial
airway, offers a potential solution to this trade-off. Clin￾icians might be reluctant to adopt the non-invasive
approach to weaning, however, because of the need
to surrender a protected airway, concerns regarding
the ventilatory support that can be provided with
non-invasive ventilation, and the increased risk of ven￾tilator associated pneumonia if reintubation is
required.24 Moreover, the optimal timing for transi￾tioning patients to non-invasive ventilation for wean￾ing remains to be determined.
Most studies in our review included patients with
predominantlyw2 w5 or exclusivelyw1 w4 w6-w10 w12 chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease might be ideally suited
to non-invasive ventilation given its ability to offset
respiratory muscle fatigue and tachypnoea, augment
tidal volume, and reduce intrinsic positive end expira￾tory pressure.9 25 Subgroup analyses suggested greater
benefits of non-invasive weaning in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although
results of analyses of subgroup effects were predomi￾nantly non-significant. Inferences from the subgroup
analyses are limited by contamination of mixed popu￾lations with patients with chronic obstructive pulmon￾ary disease, the small number of studies evaluating
non-invasive weaning in patients with other causes of
respiratory failure, and are probably underpowered to
detect significant interactions. Whether other causes of
respiratory failure are as amenable to non-invasive
weaning remains to be determined.
We found that non-invasive weaning significantly
reduced mortality and length of stay in intensive care
and hospital consistent with (and possibly due to) the
observed reduction in ventilator associated pneumo￾nia. Direct access to respiratory secretions among inva￾sively weaned patients, however, might have enhanced
detection of ventilator associated pneumonia in this
group. Moreover, in the control groups mortality
(range 11.1%w3 w6 to 60.0%w12) and rates of ventilator
associated pneumonia (range 6.3%w2 to 59.1%w5) var￾ied among the included trials. The small number of
events in the included studies,26 the variability in
event rates in control groups, and the absence of a

single adequately powered randomised controlled trial
directly comparing the alternative weaning strategies
limits the strength of our inferences.
While surviving admission to hospital is undoubt￾edly an important outcome for patients and healthcare
providers, it can be influenced by many factors result￾ing in highly variable lengths of stay. Patients might
remain in hospital at arbitrary time points (such as
60 days) because of factors related and unrelated to
the initial illness that precipitated admission. This
might not only influence the distribution of events
between two treatment arms but might also underesti￾mate mortality (biasing towards a mortality benefit).
Conversely, extended follow-up might be influenced
by additional deaths unrelated to the treatment of inter￾est (biasing against a mortality benefit). To examine the
potential influence of measuring mortality at various
time points, we pooled study estimates of mortality
using random effects models in three categories: mor￾tality or time in intensive care not specified (six trials)
(relative risk 0.63, 0.32 to 1.25, P=0.18); hospital, inpa￾tient, or 30 day mortality (seven trials) (0.56, 0.31 to
1.01, P=0.05); and 60-90 day mortality (three trials)
(0.42, 0.21 to 0.80, P=0.009). While underpowered to
detect differences (with fewer events and trials at each
time point), the pooled results support a qualitatively
similar direction of treatment effect in favour of non￾invasive weaning.
The included studies varied in the methods used to
identify candidates for weaning and to titrate and dis￾continue mechanical support. Multidisciplinary proto￾cols to identify candidates for weaning and for the
conduct of daily trials of spontaneous breathing reduce
the duration of mechanical ventilation.27-33 In our
meta-analysis, while only three trials screened daily
for readiness for trials of spontaneous breathing, four
additional trials conducted pre-randomisation trials of
spontaneous breathing, and four trials assessed for
resolution of pulmonary infection to identify weaning
readiness. The latter strategy prioritises resolution of
the cause of respiratory failure (bronchopulmonary
infection) over meeting conventional weaning criteria
and represents a novel approach to identifying candi￾dates for weaning in selected populations. In trials that
did not include a trial of spontaneous breathing after
randomisation, however, some invasively ventilated
patients might have been ventilated longer than neces￾sary. While methods for identifying candidates for
weaning might affect study estimates of the duration
of ventilation, they represent pre-randomisation
study design considerations and are less likely to result
in important performance bias. Conversely, unequal
or inconsistent use of weaning protocols and the fre￾quency with which periods of spontaneous breathing
(non-invasive strategy) or trials of spontaneous breath￾ing (invasive strategy) were permitted represent impor￾tant post-randomisation study design considerations
that could bias estimates of the duration of ventilation
in unblinded weaning trials. Opportunities for com￾parable reductions in mechanical support were pro￾vided by using weaning protocols or guidelines in
both treatment groups in seven trials with variable
use of periods of spontaneous breathing (or trials of
spontaneous breathing) among the included studies.
Whereas 11 trials reported use of criteria to discon￾tinue mechanical ventilation in both groups, only six
reported explicit reintubation criteria after a failed
attempt at extubation. While recent literature supports
that administration of sedation is an important consid￾eration in study design, with the potential to affect
length of ventilation,34 only one study in our review
used a sedation protocol.w3 Overall, most trials
included measures to reduce bias after randomisation
and were of moderate to high quality, though variation
among trials in adopting these measures limits inter￾pretation of some of the pooled results.

This review was strengthened by an extensive search
for relevant trials. We conducted duplicate indepen￾dent citation screening and data abstraction and corre￾sponded with lead investigators to clarify study
methods where needed. In addition to appraising the
quality of randomised trials, we also assessed metho￾dological features specific to weaning trials that might
influence estimates of treatment effect. We used ran￾dom effects models in pooling data, which take into
consideration variation both between and within stu￾dies. Pooling results in a meta-analysis implicitly
assumes that the studies are sufficiently similar with
respect to their populations, study interventions, out￾comes, and methodological quality that one could rea￾sonably expect a comparable underlying treatment
effect. A priori, we planned sensitivity and subgroup
analyses to explain the differences among study results
and anticipating heterogeneity in pooling across stu￾dies for selected outcomes.
Conclusion
Current trials of non-invasive weaning, while limited
by inclusion of small numbers of patients mostly with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, consistently
show positive effects on mortality and ventilator asso￾ciated pneumonia. The evidence of benefit is promis￾ing, but additional trials are required to fully evaluate
the net clinical benefits on clinical outcomes associated
with non-invasive weaning, especially the risks asso￾ciated with extubation and the impact of reintubation
after a failed attempt at extubation on clinical out￾comes. If consideration is being given to weaning
patients with non-invasive ventilation, we suggest that
it be preferentially used in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and applied in a highly
monitored environment. A well designed, adequately
powered randomised controlled with explicitly
defined end points comparing the alternative
approaches to weaning is justified.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Non-invasive ventilation has been widely investigated as an initial treatment to prevent
intubation and intubation related complications
Many patients with severe respiratory failure, impaired sensorium, haemodynamic
instability, or difficulty clearing secretions undergo direct intubation or intubation after a
failed attempt at non-invasive ventilation
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Non-invasive weaning was associated with decreased mortality, ventilator associated
pneumonia, length of stay in intensive care and hospital, total duration of mechanical
ventilation, and duration of invasive ventilation
