A new and highly pathogenic coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, 
starting from December 2019 that quickly spread nationwide and to other countries 
around the world1–3
. Here, to better understand the initial step of infection at an 
atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain 
(RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to the cell receptor ACE2. The overall 
ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV 
RBD, which also uses ACE2 as the cell receptor4
. Structural analysis identified residues 
in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that are essential for ACE2 binding, the majority of which 
either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those in the 
SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly indicate 
convergent evolution between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved 
binding to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and SARS-related 
coronaviruses1–3,5
. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies that target the RBD are 
also analysed for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, providing insights into the future 
identification of cross-reactive antibodies.
The emergence of the highly pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 
in Wuhan and its rapid international spread has posed a serious 
global public-health emergency1–3
. Similar to individuals who were 
infected by pathogenic SARS-CoV in 2003 and Middle East respira￾tory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, patients infected 
by SARS-CoV-2 showed a range of symptoms including dry cough, 
fever, headache, dyspnoea and pneumonia with an estimated mortal￾ity rate ranging from 3 to 5%6–8
. Since the initial outbreak in Decem￾ber of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread throughout China and to more 
than 80 other countries and areas worldwide. As of 5 March 2020, 
80,565 cases in China have been confirmed with the infection and 
3,015 infected patients have died (https://www.who.int/emergencies/
diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). As a result, 
the epicentre Wuhan and the neighbouring cities have been under 
lockdown to minimize the continued spread and the WHO (World 
Health Organization) has announced a Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern owing to the rapid and global dissemination 
of SARS-CoV-2.
Phylogenetic analyses of the coronavirus genomes have revealed 
that SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, which 
includes SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, bat SARS-related coronaviruses 
(SARSr-CoV), as well as others identified in humans and diverse 
animal species1–3,5
. Bat coronavirus RaTG13 appears to be the closest 
relative of the SARS-CoV-2, sharing more than 93.1% sequence iden￾tity in the spike (S) gene. SARS-CoV and other SARSr-CoVs, however, 
are distinct from SARS-CoV-2 and share less than 80% sequence 
identity1
.
Coronaviruses use the homotrimeric spike glycoprotein (comprising 
a S1 subunit and S2 subunit in each spike monomer) on the envelope 
to bind to their cellular receptors. Such binding triggers a cascade of 
events that leads to the fusion between cell and viral membranes for cell 
entry. Previous cryo-electron microscopy studies of the SARS-CoV spike 
protein and its interaction with the cell receptor ACE2 have shown that 
receptor binding induces the dissociation of the S1 with ACE2, prompt￾ing the S2 to transit from a metastable pre-fusion to a more-stable 
post-fusion state that is essential for membrane fusion9–12. Therefore, 
binding to the ACE2 receptor is a critical initial step for SARS-CoV to 
enter into target cells. Recent studies also highlighted the important 
role of ACE2 in mediating entry of SARS-CoV-21,13–15. HeLa cells express￾ing ACE2 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection whereas those without 
ACE2 are not1
. In vitro binding measurements also showed that the 
SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds to ACE2 with an affinity in the low nanomolar 
range, indicating that the RBD is a key functional component within the 
S1 subunit that is responsible for binding of SARS-CoV-2 by ACE213,16.

Article
The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
trimer has recently been reported in two independent studies13,17. How￾ever, inspection of one available spike structure revealed the incom￾plete modelling of the RBD, particularly for the receptor-binding motif 
(RBM) that interacts directly with ACE217. Computer modelling of the 
interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 has identified some 
residues that are potentially involved in the interaction; however, the 
actual residues that mediate the interaction remained unclear18. Fur￾thermore, despite detectable cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing 
activity of serum or plasma from patients who recovered from 
SARS-CoV infections15, no isolated SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies 
are able to neutralize SARS-CoV-216,17. These findings highlight some of 
the intrinsic sequence and structure differences between the SARS-CoV 
and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs.
To elucidate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 
ACE2 at a higher resolution, we determined the structure of the 
SARS-CoV-2 RBD–ACE2 complex using X-ray crystallography. This 
atomic-level structural information greatly improves our under￾standing of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and susceptible 
cells, provides a precise target for neutralizing antibodies, and 
assists the structure-based vaccine design that is urgently needed 
in the ongoing fight against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we expressed 
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues Arg319–Phe541) (Fig. 1a, b) and the 
N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 (residues Ser19–Asp615) in 
Hi5 insect cells and purified them by Ni-NTA affinity purification and 
gel filtration (Extended Data Fig. 1). The structure of the complex 
was determined by molecular replacement using the SARS-CoV RBD 
and ACE2 structures as search models4
, and refined to a resolution 
of 2.45 Å with final Rwork and Rfree factors of 19.6% and 23.7%, respec￾tively (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1). The final 
model contains residues Thr333–Gly526 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, 
residues Ser19–Asp615 of the ACE2 N-terminal peptidase domain, 
one zinc ion, four N-acetyl-β-glucosaminide (NAG) glycans linked 
to ACE2 Asn90, Asn322 and Asn546 and to RBD Asn343, as well as 
80 water molecules.
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β 
sheet (β1, β2, β3, β4 and β7) with short connecting helices and loops 
that form the core (Fig. 1b, c). Between the β4 and β7 strands in the 
core, there is an extended insertion containing the short β5 and β6 
strands, α4 and α5 helices and loops (Fig. 1b, c). This extended inser￾tion is the RBM, which contains most of the contacting residues of 
SARS-CoV-2 that bind to ACE2. A total of nine cysteine residues are 
found in the RBD, eight of which form four pairs of disulfide bonds 
that are resolved in the final model. Among these four pairs, three 
are in the core (Cys336–Cys361, Cys379–Cys432 and Cys391–Cys525), 
which help to stabilize the β sheet structure (Fig. 1c); the remaining 
pair (Cys480–Cys488) connects the loops in the distal end of the RBM 
(Fig. 1c). The N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 has two lobes, form￾ing the peptide substrate binding site between them. The extended 
RBM in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD contacts the bottom side of the small lobe 
of ACE2, with a concave outer surface in the RBM that accommodates 
the N-terminal helix of the ACE2 (Fig. 1c). The overall structure of the 
SARS-CoV-2 RBD is similar to that of the SARS-CoV RBD (Extended 
Data Fig. 3a), with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.2 Å for 
174 aligned Cα atoms. Even in the RBM, which has more sequence vari￾ation, the overall structure is also highly similar (r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å) to 
the SARS-CoV RBD, with only one obvious conformational change in 
the distal end (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The overall binding mode of 
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 is also nearly identical to that observed 
in the previously determined structure of the SARS-CoV RBD–ACE2 
complex4
 (Extended Data Fig. 3b).
The cradling of the N-terminal helix of ACE2 by the outer surface 
of the RBM results in a large buried surface of 1,687 Å2
 (864 Å2
 on the 
RBD and 823 Å2
 on the ACE2) at the SARS-CoV-2 RBD–ACE2 interface. 
A highly similar buried surface of 1,699 Å2
 contributed by SARS-CoV 
RBD (869 Å2
) and ACE2 (830 Å2
) is also observed at the SARS-CoV RBD–
ACE2 interface. With a distance cut-off of 4 Å, a total of 17 residues of 
the RBD are in contact with 20 residues of ACE2 (Fig. 2a and Extended 
Data Table 2). Analysis of the interface between the SARS-CoV RBD and 
ACE2 revealed a total of 16 residues of the SARS-CoV RBD in contact 
with 20 residues of ACE2 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 2). Among 
the 20 ACE2 residues that interact with the two different RBDs, 17 resi￾dues are shared between both interactions and most of the contact￾ing residues are located at the N-terminal helix (Fig. 2a and Extended 
Data Table 2).
To compare the ACE2-interacting residues on the SARS-CoV-2 
and SARS-CoV RBDs, we used structure-guided sequence align￾ment and mapped them to their respective sequences (Fig. 2b). 
Among 14 shared amino acid positions used by both RBMs for 
the interaction with ACE2, 8 have the identical residues between 
the two RBDs, including Tyr449/Tyr436, Tyr453/Tyr440, Asn487/
Asn473, Tyr489/Tyr475, Gly496/Gly482, Thr500/Thr486, Gly502/
Gly488 and Tyr505/Tyr491 of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV, respectively 
(Fig. 2b). Five positions have residues that have similar biochemi￾cal properties despite of having different side chains, including 
Leu455/Tyr442, Phe456/Leu443, Phe486/Leu472, Gln493/Asn479 
and Asn501/Thr487 of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV, respectively (Fig. 2b).

The remaining position is at the Gln498/Tyr484 location (Fig. 2b), 
at which Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Tyr484 of SARS-CoV both inter￾act with Asp38, Tyr41, Gln42, Leu45 and Lys353 of ACE2. Among 
the six RBD positions with changed residues, SARS-CoV residues 
Tyr442, Leu472, Asn479 and Thr487 have previously been shown 
to be essential for binding ACE218. At the Leu455/Tyr442 position, 
Leu455 of SARS-CoV-2 and Tyr442 of SARS-CoV have similar interac￾tions with Asp30, Lys31 and His34 of ACE2 (Fig. 3a). At the Phe486/
Leu472 position, Phe486 of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Gln24, Leu79, 
Met82 and Tyr83 of ACE2, whereas Leu472 of SARS-CoV has less 
interactions with Leu79 and Met82 of ACE2 (Fig. 3a). At the Gln493/
Asn479 position, Gln493 of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Lys31, His34 
and Glu35 of ACE2 and forms a hydrogen bond with Glu35; Asn479 of 
SARS-CoV interacts with only His34 of ACE2 (Fig. 3a). At the Asn501/
Thr487 position, both residues have similar interactions with Tyr41, 
Lys353, Gly354 and Asp355 of ACE2 (Fig. 3a). Asn501 of SARS-CoV-2 
and Thr487 of SARS-CoV both form a hydrogen bond with Tyr41 of 
ACE2 (Fig. 3a). Outside the RBM, there is a unique ACE2-interacting 
residue (Lys417) in SARS-CoV-2, which forms salt-bridge interactions 
with Asp30 of ACE2 (Fig. 3b). This position is replaced by a valine in 
the SARS-CoV RBD that fails to participate in ACE2 binding (Figs. 2b, 
3b). Furthermore, a comparison of the surface electrostatic poten￾tial also identified a positive charged patch on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD 
contributed by Lys417 that is absent on the SARS-CoV RBD (Fig. 3b). 
These subtly different ACE2 interactions may contribute to the 
difference in binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 
to the ACE2 receptor (4.7 nM compared with 31 nM, respectively) 
(Extended Data Fig. 4).
One notable and common feature that was found for both RBD–
ACE2 interfaces is the networks of hydrophilic interactions. There are 
13 hydrogen bonds and 2 salt bridges at the SARS-CoV-2 RBD–ACE2 
interface, and 13 hydrogen bonds and 3 salt bridges at the SARS-CoV 
RBD–ACE2 interface (Table 1). The second shared feature is the involve￾ment of multiple tyrosine residues that form hydrogen-bonding 
interactions with the polar hydroxyl group. These include Tyr449, 
Tyr489 and Tyr505 from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Tyr436, Tyr475 and 
Tyr491 from the SARS-CoV RBD (Table 1). The third shared feature 
may reside in the Asn90-linked glycans of the ACE2 that bind to dif￾ferent RBDs. In the structure of the SARS-CoV RBD–ACE2 complex, 
a chain of Asn90-linked NAG–NAG–β-d-mannose is in contact with 
Thr402 of the SARS-CoV RBD (Extended Data Fig. 5a), and this gly￾can–RBD interaction has been proposed to have important roles in the 
binding of SARS-CoV RBD by ACE24,19. In the SARS-CoV-2 RBD–ACE2 
structure, the density enabled only the modelling of the first NAG 
linked to ACE2 Asn90, and no interactions between this NAG and the 
SARS-CoV-2 RBD were observed (Extended Data Fig. 5b). However, 
this does not exclude that glycans after the first NAG may interact 
with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and may have important roles in the bind￾ing of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2. Taken together, our results show 
that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD–ACE2 and SARS-CoV RBD–ACE2 interfaces 
share substantial similarity in the buried surface area, the number of 
interacting residues and hydrophilic interaction networks, although

some of the ACE2 interactions observed both inside and outside the 
RBM were different (Fig. 3a, b). Such similarities argue strongly for 
the convergent evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD struc￾tures to improve binding affinity to the same ACE2 receptor, although 
SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV in the 
Betacoronavirus genus.
Consistent with the high structural similarity, we found that the 
binding affinities between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs 
also fall into a similar range. Specifically, the equilibrium dissociation 
constant (KD) of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD is 4.7 nM, and of ACE2 and 
SARS-CoV RBD is 31 nM (Extended Data Fig. 4). Similar results have also 
been reported by other groups13,16. However, this is slightly different 
from a recent report in which an approximately 20-fold increased bind￾ing between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer was found (KD of 
14.7 nM) compared with that between ACE2 and SARS-CoV RBD–SD1 
(KD of 325 nM)17. This is perhaps due to the different proteins used in 
the assay or because of other unknown reasons. Nevertheless, the bind￾ing affinity alone is unlikely to explain the unusual transmissibility of 
SARS-CoV-2. Other factors such as the unique ‘RRAR’ furin cleavage 
site at the S1–S2 boundary of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may have 
more-important roles in facilitating the rapid human-to-human trans￾mission of SARS-CoV-2.
Neutralizing antibodies represent an important component of 
the immune system in the fight against viral infections. It has been 
reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be cross-neutralized by horse 
anti-SARS-CoV serum and convalescent serum from a patient 
with a SARS-CoV infection1,15, reinforcing the structural similarity 
between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Such similarity also 
increased the hope of the rapid application of previously character￾ized SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies in the clinical setting. However, 
no antibody that targeted SARS-CoV (m396, S230, 80R and CR3014) 
has so far demonstrated any notable cross-binding and neutraliza￾tion activity against spike protein or RBD of SARS-CoV-216,17,20–23. One 
exception is SARS-CoV antibody CR3022 that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 
RBD with a KD of 6.2 nM, although its neutralizing activity against 
SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported16. Currently, we are uncertain 
where exactly the epitope of CR3022 on the RBDs of SARS-CoV or 
SARS-CoV-2 is located. Among the three antibodies that are incapable

of binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two (m396 and 80R) have their 
epitopes resolved by the high-resolution crystal-structure deter￾mination of SARS-CoV RBD–Fab complexes20,21. By mapping these 
epitope residues onto the sequence of SARS-CoV RBD aligned with 
the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 4), we found that antibody 
m396 has 7 residue changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD among 21 epitope 
positions (Fig. 4). There are 16 residue changes in the SARS-CoV-2 
RBD among 25 epitope positions of antibody 80R (Fig. 4). This may 
provide a structural basis for the lack of cross-reactivity of m396 
and 80R with SARS-CoV-2. The cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 
by horse anti-SARS-CoV serum and serum or plasma from patients 
recovered from SARS-CoV infections reveals a great potential in 
identifying antibodies with cross-reactivity between these two cor￾onaviruses1,15. The conserved non-RBD regions in the spike protein, 
such as the S2 subunit, are the potential targets for cross-reactive 
antibodies. Although the RBD is less conserved, identical residues 
between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD exist, even in the more vari￾able RBM (Fig. 4). Considering that the RBD is the important region 
for receptor binding, antibodies that target the conserved epitopes 
in the RBD will also present a great potential for developing highly 
potent cross-reactive therapeutic agents against diverse coronavirus 
species, including SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Data reporting
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not 
blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Protein expression and purification
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the N-terminal peptidase domain of human 
ACE2 were expressed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system (Invitro￾gen). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues Arg319–Phe541) with an N-terminal 
gp67 signal peptide for secretion and a C-terminal 6×His tag for puri￾fication was inserted into the pFastBac-Dual vector (Invitrogen). The 
construct was transformed into bacterial DH10Bac competent cells, and 
the extracted bacmid was then transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin 
II Reagent (Invitrogen). The low-titre viruses were collected and then 
amplified to generate high-titre virus stocks, which were used to infect 
Hi5 cells at a density of 2 × 106
 cells per ml. The supernatant of cell cul￾ture containing the secreted SARS-CoV-2 RBD was collected 60 h after 
infection, concentrated and buffer-exchanged to HBS (10 mM HEPES, 
pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD was captured by Ni-NTA 
resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 500 mM imidazole in HBS buffer. 
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD was then purified by gel filtration chromatogra￾phy using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 
HBS buffer. Fractions containing the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were collected.
The N-terminal peptidase domain of human ACE2 (residues Ser19–
Asp615) was expressed and purified by essentially the same protocol 
as used for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. To purify the SARS-CoV-2 RBD–ACE2 
complex, ACE2 was incubated with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD for 1 h on ice 
in HBS buffer, and the mixture was then subjected to gel filtration 
chromatography. Fractions containing the complex were pooled and 
concentrated to 13 mg ml−1.
Crystallization and data collection
Crystals were successfully grown at room temperature in sitting drops, 
over wells containing 100 mM MES, pH 6.5, 10% PEG 5000 MME and 12% 
1-propanol. The drops were made by mixing 200 nl of the SARS-CoV-2 
RBD–ACE2 complex in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl with 200 nl 
well solution. Crystals were collected, soaked briefly in 100 mM MES, 
pH 6.5, 10% PEG 5000 MME, 12% 1-propanol and 20% glycerol, and were 
subsequently flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were col￾lected at 100 K and at a wavelength of 1.07180 Å on the BL17U1 beam line 
of the Shanghai Synchrotron Research Facility. Diffraction data were 
autoprocessed using the aquarium pipeline24 and the data-processing 
statistics are listed in Extended Data Table 1.
Structure determination and refinement
The structure was determined using the molecular replacement method 
with PHASER in the CCP4 suite25. The search models used included the 
ACE2 extracellular domain and SARS-CoV RBD (PDB code 2AJF). Den￾sity map improvement by updating and refinement of the atoms was 
performed with ARP/wARP26. Subsequent model building and refine￾ment were performed using COOT and PHENIX, respectively27,28. Final 
Ramachandran statistics: 96.44% favoured, 3.56% allowed and 0.00% 
outliers for the final structure. The structure refinement statistics are 
listed in Extended Data Table 1. All structure figures were generated 
with PyMol29.
Surface plasmon resonance experiments
ACE2 was immobilized on a CM5 sensorchip (GE Healthcare) to a level 
of around 500 response units using a Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare) and 
a running buffer composed of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl and 
0.05% Tween-20. Serial dilutions of the SARS-CoV RBD and SARS-CoV-2 
RBD were flowed through with a concentration ranging from 62.5 to 
1.9 nM. The resulting data were fit to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore 
Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare).
