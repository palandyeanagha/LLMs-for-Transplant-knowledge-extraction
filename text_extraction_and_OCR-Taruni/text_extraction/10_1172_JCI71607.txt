Lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessel remodeling are complex biological processes frequently observed dur￾ing inflammation. Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation-associated lymphangiogenesis (IAL) is not 
merely an endpoint event, but actually a phenomenon actively involved in the pathophysiology of various inflam￾matory disorders. The VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 and VEGF-A/VEGF-R2 signaling pathways are two of the best-studied 
pathways in IAL. Methods targeting these molecules, such as prolymphangiogenic or antilymphatic treatments, 
were found to be beneficial in various preclinical and/or clinical studies. This Review focuses on the most recent 
achievements in the fields of lymphatic biology relevant to inflammatory conditions. Additionally, preclinical and 
clinical therapies that modulate IAL are summarized.
Introduction
Inflammation is a complex biological reaction associated with 
the protection of tissues against harmful agents such as microbes, 
damaged cells, or irritants. The inflammation process is known to 
accompany several localized and/or systemic events (1, 2), such as 
vascular responses, migration and activation of leukocytes, and 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Additionally, lymphan￾giogenesis is frequently encountered during inflammation (3–5).
To relieve the hostile microenvironment causing inflamma￾tion, noxious antigens and debris should be immunologically 
removed. In parallel, the excessive interstitial fluid and edema 
should be drained. In this sense, under inflammatory conditions, 
the demand for efficient lymphatic drainage increases. Accumulat￾ing evidence suggests inflammation-associated lymphangiogenesis 
(IAL) is not merely an endpoint phenotype of inflammation but 
rather a dynamic, context-dependent reaction that can alter the 
natural course of the inflammatory process and/or tissue repair 
(3, 6, 7). IAL can profoundly influence the symptomatic presenta￾tion of inflammation; for example, lymphatic vessels play a role in 
regulating tissue fluid clearance (8, 9) and macrophage/DC recruit￾ment (10, 11). Consequently, the course of IAL may directly influ￾ence the degree of mucosal edema and/or leukocyte infiltration, 
which may partially explain why cardinal signs of inflammation, 
namely redness, pain, heat, swelling, and loss of function (1, 2), 
appear at inflamed tissues. Recently, several prolymphangiogenic 
and antilymphatic therapies have been developed, supporting the 
notion that lymphatic vessels and IAL are potential therapeutic tar￾gets that can be exploited to achieve symptomatic control and an 
improved prognosis (5, 12).
Despite advances in our understanding of IAL, there are many 
concerns with clinical and preclinical lymphatic modulation. The 
lymphatic system drains directly into the systemic circulation and 
depends on the LNs to filter and remove debris and pathogens con￾tained in the lymphatic fluid (13). If lymph-borne pathogens can 
bypass the surveillance of the draining LNs, they can hijack the lym￾phatic system to gain access to the systemic circulation (14). Con￾sequently, therapeutic approaches designed to promote lymphatic 
drainage have the potential risk of saturating nodal surveillance, 
increasing systemic exposure to unfiltered pathogens and inflam￾matory mediators. Therefore, lymphatic-modulating therapies 
could turn out to be “a road to hell paved with good intentions”. 
These therapies should aim not only to improve symptoms, but 
also to correct the underlying pathogenesis of the target disease. 
To achieve this goal, it is necessary to expand our understanding of 
lymphatic biology at the bench and to carefully apply this knowl￾edge in the form of treatments at the bedside. This Review discusses 
studies from the perspective that the lymphatic system is closely 
linked with the symptomatic presentation and pathophysiology of 
certain inflammatory conditions. In addition, recent advances in 
preclinical and clinical treatments of IAL, which aim to control the 
natural course of inflammatory disorders, are summarized.
IAL
Lymphangiogenesis takes place under certain pathological situ￾ations, including inflammation and tissue repair (7). Upon ini￾tiation of inflammation, the lymphatic system is activated and 
both the extranodal lymphatic vessels at peripheral tissues and 
the intranodal lymphatic vessels display exuberant growth and 
vigorously expand in response to inflammatory stimuli (5). Pre￾viously, postnatal lymphangiogenesis was believed to take place 
exclusively through local sprouting of the preexisting lymphatic 
endothelial cells (LECs) (lymphangiogenesis; Figure 1). Although 
this remains the mainstream theory, some recent evidence sug￾gests that circulating progenitor cells might be incorporated 
directly into the growing lymphatic vessels and transdifferenti￾ate into LECs (lymphovasculogenesis; Figure 1 and refs. 15–20). 
Macrophage transdifferentiation was reported in an experimen￾tal orchitis model (15), LPS-induced peritonitis model (19), cor￾neal injury model (16), and in a human transplanted kidney (17). 
Interestingly, under normal conditions the lymphatic endothelial 
progenitor cells appear only in minute quantities, but inflamma￾tory stimuli lead to remarkable increases (18). It is notable that 
all of these observations supporting the presence of lymphatic 
endothelial progenitor cells and lymphovasculogenesis have been 
made under inflammatory conditions (16–19). Nevertheless, the 
concepts of lymphovasculogenesis and macrophage transdifferen￾tiation remain unclear and require further examination.

Signaling pathways involved in IAL
Many prolymphangiogenic signaling pathways are activated upon 
exposure to inflammatory stimuli, while the role of VEGF-C/
VEGFR-3 and VEGF-A/VEGF-R2 are the best characterized in the 
process of IAL (4, 5). Transgenic overexpression of VEGF-C resulted 
in an increase and enlargement of subcutaneous lymphatic vessels. 
Interestingly, VEGF-C–associated increases in lymphanogenesis 
relieved the severity of acute skin inflammation and edema observed 
in oxazolone-induced delayed type hypersensitivity reactions and 
ultraviolet B irradiation models (21). In contrast, other studies 
showed that inhibition of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis suppresses 
lymphangiogenesis (22–24). In addition, VEGFR-3 inhibition was 
found to relieve the severity of inflammatory symptoms in rheuma￾toid arthritis and LPS-induced acute inflammation models (23, 25).
VEGF-A is involved in another signaling pathway that induces 
prolymphangiogenic effects in a context-dependent manner. It 
is debatable whether the action and effect of VEGF-A on IAL is 
a direct or indirect consequence of this signaling pathway (23). 
VEGF-A also induces lymphatic vessel remodeling, as mice over￾expressing VEGF-A have been shown to display enlarged lym￾phatic vessels (26). Interestingly, exposure to chronic cutaneous 
inflammation induced lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessel 
hyperplasia in VEGF-A overexpressing mice, but not in wild-type 
mice (26). In contrast, inflammation was efficiently suppressed 
by simultaneous inhibition of VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 (26). 
Other signaling pathways, such as those involving TNF-α (23, 
27), lymphotoxin-α (28), toll-like receptor signaling (29), NF-κB 
(30), erythropoietin (31), COX-2, and prostaglandin E2 receptor 
signaling (32, 33) also influence prolymphangiogenesis and are 
closely involved in the process of IAL.
Antilymphatic signaling pathways repress IAL. IFN-γ modulates 
the JAK/STAT pathway and has a strong antilymphatic effect. It 
is particularly important for post-inflammatory regression of the 
already expanded neo-lymphatic network within the regional LN 
(34). TGF-β1 (35–37), endostatin (38), and thrombospondin (39) 
also have an antilymphatic role (40). However, our knowledge of 
the negative regulatory mechanisms of IAL remains relatively lim￾ited, and further studies are necessary to identify other antilym￾phatic signaling pathways.
The balance between prolymphangiogenic and 
antilymphatic elements determines the actual 
state of IAL
Intranodal follicular B cells (41, 42), CD11b macrophages (25, 
43), and fibroblast-type reticular stromal cells (44) are well rec￾ognized sources of prolymphangiogenic molecules including 
VEGF-A and VEGF-C, while T lymphocytes are the main source of 
the antilymphatic IFN-γ (34). The actual amplitude and pattern 
of IAL is determined by the balance of prolymphangiogenic and 
antilymphatic elements, which leads to a bi-directional regulatory 
Figure 1
Schematic diagram depicting IAL observed during the acute phase of inflammation. Upon activation by inflammatory stimuli, a local sprouting 
at the preexisting lymphatic vessels actively occurs in response to macrophage-secreted VEGF. As a result the lymphatic network grows and 
expands. During this process the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 and VEGF-A/VEGF-R2 signaling pathways are known to have profound importance, yet 
other signaling pathways also seem to be involved. It has been suggested that lymphangiogenic macrophages can become incorporated into the 
lymphatic vessels and transdifferentiate into LECs, but this hypothesis requires more validation.

system (Figure 2 and refs. 5, 34, 40). This allows considerable flex￾ibility and accounts for how the lymphatic system can be context 
dependent and dynamically respond to its microenvironment. 
For example, skin exposure to either LPS or the T cell mitogen 
concanavalin-A induces similar inflammatory phenotypes; how￾ever, only LPS induces significant IAL (34).
The dynamic phenotypic changes observed during IAL may be 
explained by the spatiotemporal balance between prolymphan￾giogenic and antilymphangiogenic drives. Peripheral tissue 
inflammation induces robust lymphangiogenesis in the drain￾ing LNs (34, 45, 46). During the early phase of inflammation, 
the prolymphangiogenic factors increase and initiate prolifera￾tion of the nodal subcapsular lymphatic vessels. At the peak 
of inflammation, the prolymphangiogenic factors completely 
dominate the antilymphatic factors; thus, the lymphatic net￾work spreads out. As inflammation resolves, the balance moves 
toward the antilymphatic factors and the expanded neo-lym￾phatic network regresses (25, 34, 47). In parallel, the coordina￾tion between stromal cells, immune cells, and interstitial flow 
affects the intranodal distribution of VEGF-A to influence the 
spatiotemporal pattern of IAL (48). Meanwhile, extranodal IAL 
at the peripheral tissues follows a different natural course, in 
which the bulk of expanded extranodal lymphatic vessels tend 
to remain after inflammation resolves (22, 49). This may reflect 
the absence of strong antilymphatic factors, such as intranodal 
T cells and IFN-γ, which would induce lymphatic regression in 
the peripheral tissue after inflammation is resolved.
Recently, Kelley et al. proposed the concept of lymphatic ves￾sel memory (50). Upon recurrent inflammation, lymphatic vessel 
memory provokes an accelerated expansion of structurally distinct 
but functioning lymphatic vessels. Of note, this category of lym￾phangiogenesis depends on neither the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis 
nor the VEGF-A/VEGF-R2 axis (50). Further study is necessary to 
elucidate how this novel mechanism contributes to IAL.
Lymphatic vessels and immune cells closely interact 
during inflammation
LECs are directly and indirectly involved in the regulation of toler￾ance and immunity (51). The lymphatic vessels can be considered 
the “afferent arm” of an immune reflex arc, while the blood vessels 
serve as the “efferent arm” (52). Under inflammatory conditions, 
large quantities of immune cells are transported through blood 
vessels and gather at the inflamed peripheral tissue. Lymphatic 
vessels locally promote the recruitment of macrophages and DCs 
that have gathered at the peripheral tissue. Antigen-bearing DCs 
and macrophages enter the lymphatic vessels at peripheral tissue 
through discontinuous endothelial junctions or preformed por￾tals (53, 54) and continue to travel into regional LNs. The recruit￾ed immune cells further provoke IAL by secreting prolymphan￾giogenic factors (10, 11). Such reciprocal interactions between 
lymphatic vessels and immune cells contribute to the immune 
system’s response to inflammatory stimuli.
Macrophages are one of the most important types of immune 
cells during IAL. Bone marrow–derived myeloid cells/macrophages 
are dispatched into the circulation and are transported via blood 
vessels to the inflamed tissue, where they phagocytose pathogens 
and clear debris. They then move from the peripheral tissue to 
regional LNs through lymphatic vessels, which is an important 
process for resolving inflammation (55). LECs express chemotactic 
molecules that promote macrophage infiltration. In turn, 
macrophages secrete paracrine prolymphangiogenic growth fac￾tors such as VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-A in response to inflam￾matory stimuli (20, 56, 57). Increased levels of VEGF-A enhance 
angiogenesis, which acts to reinforce immune cell recruitment 
(23). These interactions between macrophages and lymphatic ves￾sels lead to a reciprocal regulatory relationship in the process of 
IAL. Another important role of macrophages during IAL is trans￾differentiation into LECs (15–19), as described above.
DCs have a major role in adaptive immunity, as they serve as 
APCs; therefore, proper recruitment and migration of DCs are 
critical to the inflammatory response. LECs aid the recruitment of 
DCs by producing chemokines that are sensed by hematopoietic 
cells (for example, LECs express CCL21, which recruits CCR7+ DCs) 
(10, 11, 58, 59). Inflammatory cytokines provoke both LECs and 
DCs to recruit more DCs. Inflammatory stimuli trigger LECs to 
express leukocyte adhesion receptors, such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, 
and E-selectin, which mediate trafficking of DCs through the affer￾ent lymphatic vessels (60). Meanwhile, inflammatory cytokines 
promote DC maturation and their migratory capacity (61).
Studies (62, 63) on solid organ transplantation revealed that 
VEGFR-3 signaling is also involved in mediating migration of 
DCs toward the draining LN. In a rat cardiac allograft model, 
Figure 2
In LNs, the balance between the prolymphan￾giogenic factors (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D) 
and antilymphangiogenic factors (IFN-γ) influ￾ences the actual response of lymphatic vessels 
to inflammatory stimuli; accordingly, lymphatic 
vessels either grow or regress. During the acute 
stage of inflammation, the prolymphangiogenic 
factors usually dominate, in which case the final 
outcome is growth of the lymphatic vessels. As 
inflammation resolves, the antilymphangiogenic 
effect increases. Other regulators with either 
prolymphangiogenic or antilymphangiogenic 
effects have been reported; however, further 
studies are necessary before their role can be 
generalized. The coordination between stromal 
cells, immune cells, and interstitial flow seem to 
be other factors that affect the spatiotemporal 
regulation of IAL.

interfering with VEGFR-3 signaling inhibited LEC production 
of CCL21, an important chemokine required to accomplish the 
homing of activated CCR7 APCs to secondary lymphoid tissue. 
Consequently, modulating the activities of VEGFR-3 signaling 
may influence adaptive immunity (63). Similarly, in a corneal 
transplantation model, local suppression of VEGFR-3 inhib￾ited graft origin DC migration to the recipient draining LN 
(62). This reduced donor-specific delayed hypersensitivity and 
improved graft survival. In this context, reciprocal interactions 
between the lymphatic vessels and immune cells in response 
to inflammatory stimuli during IAL can ultimately affect the 
course of adaptive immunity.
Lymphatic vessels and respiratory tract inflammation
Under normal conditions, lymphatic vessels of the respiratory 
tract adopt a microstructure optimized to facilitate the entrance 
of immune cells and interstitial fluid. The basement membrane 
of lymphatic vessels is discontinuous, especially at the initial lym￾phatic capillaries, through which inflammatory cells frequently 
pass. Unlike the continuous zipper-like junctions (zippers) of 
endothelial cells that effectively seal up the borders of collecting 
lymphatic channels and blood vessels, initial lymphatics display 
LECs with overlapping flaps anchored simply by discontinuous, 
button-like junctions (buttons) (53, 54). Interestingly, 14 days 
after infection with Mycoplasma pulmonis, the airway presented 
with growing lymphatic sprouts, which had zippers instead of 
buttons (53). Such remodeling of the lymphatic vessels makes 
them less permeable and contributes to impaired fluid clearance 
and mucosal edema (8). Prophylactic administration of dexa￾methasone in the same airway inflammation model was found 
to largely prevent remodeling of both blood vessels and lymphat￾ic vessels; however, once the inflammation resolved, it was less 
effective for treating the mice. Dexamethasone treatment reversed 
most of the blood vessel remodeling caused by inflammation, but 
it failed to reverse the lymphangiogenesis (49), although some 
microstructural alterations, such as button formation, were 
observed (8). Antilymphatic treatment with anti-VEGFR-3 anti￾body (mF4-31C1) inhibited additional lymphangiogenesis but 
failed to suppress lymphatic vessels that had already been induced 
before the start of treatment. After inflammation resolved, the 
number of the sprouts decreased and their microstructure once 
again consisted of buttons (53).
Studies on human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which accom￾panies chronic inflammation and ultimately ends in pulmonary 
fibrosis and respiratory failure, suggested newly formed lymphatic 
vessels are probably part of the pathophysiology and contribute 
to the fibrotic process and maintenance of injury (64). Lymphat￾ic vessels were observed throughout fibrotic tissue and at the 
periphery of fibroblastic foci (64). With worsening of the disease, 
the number of lymphatic vessels did not change, but the newly 
formed lymphatics displayed morphologic alterations. Bronchoal￾veolar lavage fluid analysis of patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis demonstrated elevated levels of CCL21 chemokines, which 
were likely produced by LECs (64). CCL21 can promote fibroblast 
proliferation by stimulation of its receptor CCR7 and also enhance 
the recruitment of DCs (64–66). Collectively, chronic inflamma￾tory diseases involving the respiration system may be accompanied 
by significant structural alterations of lymphatic vessels, which 
probably are irreversible changes that are resistant to lymphatic 
modulating treatments.
Inflammatory bowel disease
Mice deficient for angiopoietin-2 have intestinal lymphatic 
dysplasia and exacerbated colitis in the dextran sulfate sodium 
colitis model (67, 68), suggesting that lymphatic vessels are 
functionally important for the resolution of bowel inflamma￾tion. Selective ablation of the lymphatic vessels led to distortion 
of the intestinal villi architecture and severe bowel inflamma￾tion (69). In a human study of ulcerative colitis, the disorder 
of the lymphatic vessel architecture reflected disease activity 
(70). These observations imply that the integrity of intestinal 
lymphatic vessels is essential to maintain the structure and 
function of intestinal villi. Similarly, antilymphatic treatment 
with anti–VEGFR-3 antibodies in an animal model of inflam￾matory bowel disease aggravated inflammation and submuco￾sal edema, increased leukocyte infiltration, and caused the lym￾phatic vessels to become enlarged and tortuous (67). Although 
the precise pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease is 
unknown, lymphatic vessel obstruction and dysfunction are 
long-recognized features observed in humans with this disease 
(71). Lymphangiectasia and lymphocytic perilymphangitis were 
also found in patients with Crohn’s disease, suggesting that 
lymphatic derangements are a part of the pathogenesis (72, 
73). The presence of lymphangiogenesis is another frequently 
reported feature in both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis 
(70, 74, 75). Among patients with Crohn’s disease, relatively 
lower lymphatic vessel density was associated with a higher risk 
of endoscopic disease recurrence after surgery, suggesting that 
patients could benefit from improved lymphatic flow (76). How￾ever, it remains controversial whether lymphatic expansion pro￾motes bowel inflammation and injury or represents a protective 
or adaptive response. Disturbances in lymphatic function seem 
to correspond with aggravation of inflammatory bowel disease; 
therefore, lymphangiogenic remodeling could have benefits, at 
least in the early phases of disease (76, 77), but further research 
on this issue is necessary.
Diabetes
Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation is an impor￾tant contributor to insulin resistance. Chronic inflammatory 
elements, such as macrophage-derived TNF-α, promote type 2 
diabetes (78, 79). In a diabetic animal model, lymphangiogenesis 
occurred around islet cells and contributed to the pathogenesis 
of inflammation. Suppression of VEGFR-3 reduced lymphangio￾genesis at islets and draining LNs; consequently, inflammation 
decreased, while islets were preserved (80). Moreover, functional 
alteration of the lymphatic system was also observed in a dia￾betic rat model (81). In patients with type 2 diabetes, the dermal 
lymphatic system showed increased lymphatic vessel density and 
proliferation. Freshly isolated human dermal LECs from these 
patients exhibited a distinct gene expression signature, including 
enhanced expression of chemotactic factors and leukocyte traf￾ficking receptors (CXCL10, VCAM-1, and CMTM7). This result￾ed in increased recruitment of macrophages, which can serve as a 
major source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α.
Consequently, the aberrant lymphatic vessel growth observed in 
type 2 diabetes could account for the persistent inflammation 
that impairs wound healing (82). Further studies are necessary to 
determine whether IAL under diabetic conditions is also associ￾ated with other major complications, such as macroangiopathy, 
microangiopathy, and neuropathy.

Transplantation and rejection
Immune-mediated graft rejection is one of the most devastating 
and challenging events encountered after organ transplantation. 
There is a great need for strategies to modulate the recipient’s 
immunity to promote graft survival and function while avoiding 
excessive immunosuppression. Afferent lymphatic vessels serve as 
a route for the delivery of both donor and recipient APCs, which 
carry allogenic tissue antigens to the regional LNs (83). Increased 
lymphangiogenesis promotes the migration of APCs carrying 
foreign tissue antigens to the recipient’s draining LNs, which 
provokes inflammation and is assumed to facilitate the initial 
immune cascade events that trigger adverse immune reactions. 
Some studies have shown that interference with lymphatic func￾tion suppresses lymphangiogenesis and prolongs graft survival 
(52, 83). Other studies, using an experimental corneal graft model, 
identified early post-transplantation lymphangiogenesis as a sig￾nificant risk factor for immune rejection after keratoplasty, which 
can be reduced with postoperative anti-angiogenic/antilymphan￾giogenic treatments (84–86).
Using suture-induced corneal neovascularization and corneal 
transplantation murine models, Dietrich et al. demonstrated 
that preexisting lymphangiogenesis induced by inflammation is 
a critical factor promoting immune rejections of corneal grafts 
(52). Encouragingly, even if inflammation was present prior to 
transplantation, preoperative antilymphatic treatment with 
either anti–VEGFR-3 antibody or a small-molecule agent against 
the LEC integrin α5β1 significantly improved graft survival, sug￾gesting that temporary prophylactic antilymphatic treatment 
before transplantation could be beneficial (52). A case report 
describes an allogeneic and autologous cultivated limbal stem 
cell graft transplantation instead of a conventional keratolim￾bal allograft (because the antigenicity of the graft is thought to 
decrease during culture, causing lower rates of rejection; ref. 87) 
in a patient with a history of two failed penetrating keratoplasties 
(88). Unfortunately, immune rejection still occurred, and this 
pioneering attempt failed (88). Lymphangiogenesis was observed 
in the removed graft, which again emphasizes the importance of 
IAL in transplantation (88). Another important consideration is 
the ideal timing of transplantation if inflammation has already 
occurred. Near complete regression of pathologic corneal lym￾phatic vessels was observed six months after suture-induced cor￾neal lymphangiogenesis was established in mice (89). This implies 
that the keratoplasty procedure for patients with a history of cor￾neal inflammation should be delayed, if possible, to secure an 
inflammation-free interval (86, 89).
Similar observations have been made in visceral organ trans￾plants. In a diabetic mouse model transplanted with pancreatic 
islet allografts, lymphangiogenesis occurred in the islet allografts 
and in draining LNs after transplantation (83). However, antilym￾phatic treatment using anti-VEGFR-3 antibody, FTY720, or suni￾tinib inhibited IAL and significantly prolonged graft survival (83). In 
human renal transplants (90), the lymphatic vessel density increased 
in grafts. In addition, lymphatic vessels were closely associated with 
nodular mononuclear infiltrates, which contained chemokine recep￾tor CCR7+ cells that appeared to have been attracted by LECs. These 
observations suggest that lymphangiogenesis probably contributes 
to detrimental alloreactive immune responses and the export of the 
rejection infiltrate (90). Thus, lymphangiogenesis could be exploited 
as a therapeutic target for modulating immune rejection and toler￾ance after cornea and visceral organ transplantation.
Conclusion
Lymphangiogenesis is one of the most frequently observed signs of 
inflammation. IAL is not only closely related to inflammatory symp￾toms, but it can significantly influence the course of inflammation. 
New methods for lymphatic modulation were recently developed, 
creating novel treatments for inflammatory disorders. However, 
researchers and clinicians should keep in mind that lymphatic mod￾ulating therapies could be a double-edged sword, and must consider 
the complexity and context of lymphatic biology during treatment.
Although considerable progress has been achieved, the field of 
IAL remains new and our understanding of lymphatic biology is 
far from complete. In particular, research elucidating the patho￾genic links between IAL and specific diseases is necessary for rea￾sonable clinical decision-making and evidence-based therapeutic 
approaches for lymphatic modulation. Further research, both 
preclinical and clinical, is still required to address issues relevant 
to IAL, such as autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, post￾transplant concerns, and metabolic syndromes.
