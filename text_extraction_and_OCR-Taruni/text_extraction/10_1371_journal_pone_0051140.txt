Abstract
The steadily increasing incidence of kidney injury is a significant threat to human health. The current tools available for the
early detection of kidney injury, however, have limited sensitivity or specificity. Thus, the development of novel biomarkers
to detect early kidney injury is of high importance. Employing mouse renal ischemia-reperfusion and streptozotocin (STZ)-
induced renal injury as acute and chronic kidney injury model, respectively, we assessed the alteration of microRNA (miRNA)
in mouse urine, serum and kidney tissue by TaqMan probe-based qRT-PCR assay. Our results demonstrated that kidney￾enriched microRNA-10a (miR-10a) and microRNA-30d (miR-30d) were readily detected in mouse urine and the levels of
urinary miR-10a and miR-30d were positively correlated with the degree of kidney injury induced by renal ischemia￾reperfusion or STZ diabetes. In contrast, no such alteration of miR-10a and miR-30d levels was observed in mouse serum
after kidney injury. Compared with the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) assay, the test for urinary miR-10a and miR-30d levels was
more sensitive for the detection of acute kidney injury. Furthermore, the substantial elevation of the urinary miR-10a and
miR-30d levels was also observed in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) patients compared to healthy donors. In
conclusion, the present study collectively demonstrates that urinary miR-10a and miR-30d represent a novel noninvasive,
sensitive, specific and potentially high-throughput method for detecting renal injury.

Introduction
The incidence of kidney injuries, including diabetic nephrop￾athy and drug-induced side effects, is steadily increasing worldwide
[1]. Acute kidney injury is considered to be an important risk
factor for progression to end-stage renal disease [2]. The early
detection of kidney injury would make it possible to diagnosis
acute kidney injury in a timely manner, but such detection remains
a difficult task, due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. Current
metrics for renal function, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lack
the sensitivity and/or specificity to adequately detect kidney
damage at early stages of the injury [3,4]. Recently, kidney injury
molecule-1 (Kim-1) was identified as a highly sensitive and specific
urinary biomarker for kidney injury [5]. Subsequent preclinical
studies also showed that Kim-1 is a promising early diagnostic
biomarker for monitoring acute kidney tubular necrosis [6].
Whether Kim-1 can serve as a suitable biomarker for various types
of kidney injuries, however, requires further investigation using a
large number of different renal injury samples.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ,22-nt long noncoding RNA
molecules that have emerged as a new class of gene regulators at
the posttranscriptional level. It is widely believed that miRNAs
regulate nearly 30% of protein-coding genes and are involved in
almost every aspect of developmental, pathogenic and tumorigen￾esis processes. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that miRNAs
serve as mediators in chronic kidney disease [7]. Studies of
conditional dicer-knockout mice [8,9] revealed critical roles for
miRNAs in regulating kidney development and maintaining the
structural and functional integrity of the renal collecting system
and the glomerular barrier. The determination of miRNA
expression profiles in normal kidneys and their constituent cells
has suggested that specific miRNAs may serve special functional
roles in these cells [9]. Kato and co-workers [10] reported on the
expression and function of miR-192 in diabetic kidney glomeruli.
Employing mouse renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) model,
Godwin et al. [11] identified a miRNA signature in kidney tissue
that was tightly correlated to renal IRI. Recently, studies by our
group [12,13] and others [14–19] have demonstrated that
miRNAs can be released by cells and tissues into circulation and
that these circulating miRNAs in the serum, plasma, urine, and
other body fluids are stable and can serve as noninvasive
biomarkers for various diseases and tissue injuries. When studying
the serum and urinary levels of the miR-200 family, miR-205 and
miR-192 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51140

Wang et al. [20] found that the levels of most of those miRNAs
from patients were lower than the levels of controls, suggesting that
miRNA may take part in the pathogenesis of SLE and that
miRNAs in the urine and serum could be biomarkers for SLE.
In the present study, we hypothesized that the levels of specific
circulating miRNA species could be used to detect and monitor
the pathological development associated with kidney injuries.
Using different mouse renal injury models, we reported that miR￾10a and miR-30d were readily detected in urine and that their
levels specifically correlated with mouse kidney injury induced by
renal ischemia-reperfusion or STZ treatment. The elevation of the
urinary levels of miR-10a and miR-30d was also confirmed in
urine samples from patients with focal segmental glomeruloscle￾rosis (FSGS).
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal experimental procedures were carried out in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the
Animal Care Committee of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China).
Mouse renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)
Male C57BL/6J mice (6–8 weeks old, 22–25 g) were assigned
into three groups with ten mice per group: the sham, unilateral
and bilateral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) groups. Renal I/R was
performed according to an established procedure [21]. Briefly,
mice were under general anesthesia with 0.4–0.5 g/kg chloral
hydrate and kept on a heating pad to maintain the body
temperature at 37uC. After a midline abdominal incision, the
renal pedicles were exposed by blunt dissection, and a microvas￾cular clamp was applied for 40 minutes. The kidneys were
observed after removal of the clamp(s) to assess reperfusion. After
reperfusion, ,0.8 ml of pre-warmed saline was placed in the
peritoneal cavity, and the abdomen was closed in layers. Sham
control mice were subjected to an identical operation without
renal pedicle clamping. Mouse urine was collected using a
metabolic cage at 18,24 h and 30,36 h after reperfusion,
respectively. Mice were sacrificed at 24 and 36 h after reperfusion
and blood samples were collected and the kidneys were removed.
Part of the kidney tissue was fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered
formalin followed by paraffin embedding for histological study.
Renal function determination
Renal function was monitored by measuring the BUN
concentration using analytical kits according to the protocols
specified by the manufacturer (Rongsheng Biotech, Shanghai,
China). Mouse blood samples were collected when mice were
sacrificed. Samples were centrifuged to separate plasma.
Histological staining
Renal histology was examined by hematoxylin/eosin staining.
Briefly, kidneys were collected and fixed in 10% phosphate￾buffered formalin at 4uC overnight. The kidneys were subse￾quently paraffin embedded and sectioned (4 mm). Sections were
stained with hematoxylin/eosin for general histology. Images of
representative fields were recorded.
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from 100 mL samples (serum or
urine). In brief, 100 mL sample was mixed with 300 mL
diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, 200 mL acid phenol, 200 mL
chloroform. The mixture was vortex-mixed vigorously and
centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min at room temperature. After
phase separation, the aqueous layer (,400 mL) was mixed with 2
volumes of isopropyl alcohol and 0.1 volumes of 3 mol/L sodium
acetate (pH 5.3). This solution was stored at 220uC for 1 h. The
RNA pellet was collected by centrifugation at 16000 g for 20 min
at 4uC. The resulting RNA pellet was washed once with 750 mL/
L ethanol and air-dried for 10 min at room temperature. Finally,
the pellet was dissolved in 20 mL of ribonuclease-free water.
Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced kidney damage
Kidney injury was established in STZ-induced diabetic mice as
previously described [22]. Male C57BL/6J mice were divided into
two groups (eight mice/per group) after measuring the body
weight. Group 1 was intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg/kg of
STZ dissolved in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.5) for 5 consecutive
days. Group 2 was given an equal volume of citrate buffer. At
week 8 post-injection, individual mice were placed in metabolic
cages to obtain 24 h urine collections. Blood glucose levels from
the tail-vein were measured using the OneTouch Blood Glucose
Monitoring System (LifeScan, Milpitas, CA) at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks
post-injection. The mice were fasted for 4 h before blood glucose
measurement. Freshly voided spot urine samples were collected at
1, 4 and 8 weeks post-injection. Urinary albumin was measured by
ELISA kits (Bethyl Laboratories, Houston, TX). After mice were
sacrificed, kidneys were collected, washed with saline, dried with
filter paper and weighed with a precision balance.
Urine and blood samples from healthy donors and FSGS
patients
The present study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China) and written
informed consent was obtained from each participant. Urine
and blood samples (10–15 mL) were collected from 16 healthy
donors and 16 FSGS patients (Table 1). Renal function was
monitored by measuring BUN, blood pressure, urinary protein,
serum creatinine, BUN, uric acid, creatinine clearance, triglycer￾ide and total cholesterol.

Urinary miRNAs as Biomarkers for Kidney Injury
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51140

TaqMan probe-based qRT-PCR of miRNAs
Total RNA including miRNA was isolated from various tissues
of C57BL/6J mice and mouse or human urine and sera using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA) as previously described [12,13].
Stem-loop qRT-PCR assays using TaqMan miRNA probes
(Applied Biosystems) were performed [13,23]. Real-time PCR
was performed using a TaqMan PCR kit and an Applied
Biosystems 7300 Sequence Detection System. The reactions were
incubated in a 96-well plate at 95uC for 10 min followed by 40
cycles of 95uC for 15 sec and 60uC for 1 min. All reactions,
including no-template controls, were performed in triplicate. After
the reactions, the cycle threshold (CT) data were determined using
default threshold settings, and the mean CT was determined from
the triplicate PCRs. A comparative DCT method was used to
compare each condition with controls, and values were expressed
as 22DCT. The relative levels of miRNAs in tissues were
normalized to U6, a ubiquitously expressed small nuclear RNA.
For quantification of sera and urinary miRNA, an equal amount
of the synthetic plant MIR168a was spiked in each serum sample
prior to RNA extraction to serve as internal control.
Statistical analysis
For each experiment, qRT-PCR assays were performed in
triplicate. The data shown are represented as means 6 SEM for at
least three independent experiments. Differences were considered
statistically significant at p,0.05, as assessed using Student’s t-test.
Results
Identification of miR-10a and miR-30d as kidney-specific
miRNAs
The role of miRNA in kidney function has been illustrated
previously by investigators through the specific knockdown of
Dicer activity in podocyte cells [8,9]. Tissue profiling assays
further demonstrated that the kidney and its constituent cells
contain unique miRNAs, particularly members of the miR-10 and
miR-30 families [24] and miR-192 [10]. Depending on the
species, the profile of miRNAs in the kidney might be different.
Employing Solexa sequencing, we previously analyzed the miRNA
expression profile in various mouse tissues, and as shown in Table
S1, different tissues have different miRNA profiles. For mouse
kidney, after rule out the miRNAs with very low total signal, we
found that miR-10a and miR-30d, as well as other miRNAs in
miR-1 and miR-30 families, were relatively enriched in kidney
tissue. This result was further validated using a TaqMan probe￾based qRT-PCR, we detected the expression of miR-10a, miR￾30d and miR-192 in various mouse organs: the heart, spleen,
kidney, colon and lung. The expression of miR-122, a liver-specific
miRNA, served as a control. To compare the expression of a
miRNA in various tissues, we normalized the expression level of
miRNA against the expression of U6 in the same tissues. As shown
in Figure 1, we found that mouse kidneys contained a significantly
higher level of miR-10a and miR-30d than did other tissues,
confirming that these two miRNAs are kidney specific. Although
miR-192 was detected at a high level in the kidney, it was also
strongly expressed in the liver and colon. In agreement with a
previous report [25], miR-122 was predominantly expressed in
mouse liver.
Elevation of the level of kidney-specific miRNAs in mouse
urine after kidney injury
Based on the tissue distribution of miRNAs determined by
qRT-PCR assays, miR-10a and miR-30d were selected as kidney￾specific miRNAs for further analysis. Next, we tested whether
miR-10a and miR-30d are released into animal urine under
normal and injury conditions. In this experiment, we employed
unilateral and bilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in mice as
a kidney injury model. Urine samples from normal male C57BL/
6J mice (6–8 weeks old, 22–25 g) and male C57BL/6J mice with
kidney injuries were collected, and absolute levels of miR-10a and
miR-30d were assessed. As shown in Figure 2A, unilateral and
bilateral renal I/R caused pathological damage to mouse kidneys
in various degrees. Compared with the sham control group,
transient ischemia caused marked tubular injury, as shown by loss
of brush border, tubular dilation, and intratubular cast formation;
unilateral and bilateral renal I/R kidney also showed glomerulus
atrophy with enlarged capsular spaces and tubule atrophy with
compensatory hypertrophy of the adjacent glomeruli. Although no
fibrous connective tissue desmoplasia or inflammatory cell
infiltration was observed in the injured kidneys, part of the tubule,
particularly in bilateral I/R kidneys, exhibited cellular and hyaline
cast formation and significant tubular dilatation. Several tubular
epithelial cells had papillary hyperplasia and granular degenera￾tion. The kidney injury was also determined using the BUN assay
(Figure 2B). In agreement with this, we also detected an increased
level of KIM-1 [26] and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL) [27] in I/R kidney (Figure S1). As can be seen, blood urea
nitrogen was elevated in mice with bilateral I/R but not the mice
with unilateral I/R. Because the tissue section and pathological
analysis clearly suggested damage to the mouse kidney under
unilateral I/R, the failure to detect the elevation of BUN in the
mice with unilateral I/R is indicative of the sensitivity limitation of
this method.
Conversely, we found that miRNAs were normally expressed in
mouse urine at 0.1–15.0 fmol/L range and were readily detected
by the qRT-PCR assay. More importantly, the levels of urinary
miR-10a and miR-30d were significantly increased in mice with
either unilateral ischemia/reperfusion or bilateral ischemia/
reperfusion. Compared with the sham control group, unilateral
and bilateral ischemia/reperfusion kidney resulted in 5.5- and
19.5-fold elevations of urinary miR-10a, respectively (Figure 2C),
and 5.4- and 10.0-fold elevations of urinary miR-30d, respectively
(Figure 2D). The urinary levels of miRNAs that were not
specifically expressed in kidneys, such as miR-16, were not altered
following either unilateral or bilateral ischemia/reperfusion
(Figure 2E). Together, these results strongly suggest that urinary
miR-10a and miR-30d could serve as sensitive and specific
biomarkers for kidney injury.
Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated
that the alteration of the serum miRNA expression profile can be
used as a molecular fingerprint for various diseases [12] and organ
injuries [17,20]. Therefore, we also detected the levels of miR-10a
and miR-30d in mouse serum with or without renal I/R.
Interestingly, we found that the miR-10a and miR-30d levels in
serum were not correlated with kidney injury. As shown in Figure
S2, no alteration of miR-10a or miR-30d in mouse serum was
observed after unilateral renal I/R. After bilateral renal I/R, the
level of miR-30d in serum was still unchanged, while the level of
miR-10a was reduced. The elevation of kidney-enriched miR-10a
and miR-30d in urine (Figure 2) but not serum (Figure S2) during
renal I/R indicated that these miRNAs may be directly correlated
with kidney injury.
Next we determined the levels of miR-10a and miR-30d in
mouse kidney tissue with or without renal I/R. As shown in Figure
S3A, both miR-10a and miR-30d in mouse kidney were
significantly reduced during renal I/R. Interestingly, the levels of
pre-miR-10a and pre-miR-30d in mouse kidney tissues were not

changed (Figure S3B). Moreover, pre-miR-10a and pre-miR-30d
were not detected in mouse urine by qRT-PCR (data not shown).
These results collectively suggest that elevation of mouse urinary
miR-10a and miR-30d during renal I/R is likely due to the release
of mature miR-10a and miR-30d from mouse kidney tissue.
Chronic diabetic conditions generally lead to kidney injury [28].
To test whether urinary miR-10a and miR-30d can be biomarkers
for diabetes-induced renal injury, we employed streptozotocin
(STZ)-treated diabetic mice as another kidney injury model. In this
experiment, type 1 diabetes was induced in C57BL/6J mice with
STZ treatment. In specific, mice were fasted for 4 h, followed by
intraperitoneal injection with STZ at a dose of 50 mg/kg body
weight for five days consecutively. Blood-glucose level test showed
that STZ-treated mice maintained a hyperglycemia condition.
Compared to the normal mice, the levels of kidney weight, blood
glucose and 24 h urinary protein were all significantly increased in
2 month STZ-treated mice (Table 2). As shown in Figure 3, the
urinary levels of miR-10a and miR-30d were significantly higher
in STZ-treated mice compared with those in vehicle-treated
control mice. In contrast, compared with the normal mice, the
mice with only hyperglycemia showed either moderately de￾creased or unchanged levels of miR-10a and miR-30d in serum.
Although the 24 h urinary protein level was not significantly
increased after one month treatment with STZ, ultrastructural
analysis indicated that, comparing to normal distribution of
podocyte foot process, diabetic mice with one month STZ
treatment showed apparent segmental podocyte foot process
effacement (Figure 3E, arrow). These results suggest that the
elevation of urinary miR-10a and miR-30d levels may specifically
reflect hyperglycemia-induced kidney injury.
Elevation of miR-10a and miR-30d levels in the urine of
FSGS patients
To find out whether the elevation of urinary miR-10a and miR￾30d also occurs in patient with kidney injuries, we assessed the
levels of urinary miR-10a and miR-30d in FSGS patients. Renal
dysfunction of FSGS patients was also monitored by measuring
blood pressure, BUN, serum creatinine, uric acid, urinary protein,
urinary red blood cell, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance,
triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. As shown in Table 1,
FSGS patients had a significantly higher proteinuria level that the
healthy controls. The levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol
levels in these patients were also higher than those in the healthy
controls. Next we compared the levels of miR-10a and miR-30d in
urine from healthy volunteers with those from FSGS patients. As
shown in Figure 4, compared with the levels of urinary miR-10a
and miR-30d from healthy donors, the urine from FSGS patients
contained about 13- and 10-fold higher concentrations of miR-10a

extracted, and the miRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR assay using U6 as an internal control.

and miR-30d, respectively. High levels of urinary kidney-enriched
miR-10a and miR-30d clearly indicate the kidney injuries in FSGS
patients.
Discussion
Urine is regarded as a source for biomarkers, given its easy
availability and reduced complexity when compared with serum.
Many urinary proteins, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated
lipocalin (NGAL) [27], N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) [29],
and ectodomain of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) [5], have
been evaluated as noninvasive indicators of renal injury. However,
problems with the reliable use of these proteins to identify and
monitor kidney injury, including instability in the urine, modifi￾cation due to physicochemical properties of the urine, delayed
appearance, inconsistency of upregulation with different models of
nephrotoxicity, and the absence of sustained elevation throughout
the time course of renal injury to monitor the progression and
regression of injury, limit the wide application of these marker
proteins. As endogenous small noncoding RNAs, miRNAs hold
great promise as unique accessible biomarkers to monitor tissue
injury because of their size, abundance, tissue specificity, and
relative stability. Indeed, accumulating evidence has demonstrated
the usage of circulating miRNAs in various body fluids as an
indicator for tissue injury [17,20]. In the present study, we
observed increases in the urinary concentrations of miR-10a and
miR-30d corresponding to kidney injuries. Furthermore, urinary
miR-10a and miR-30d exhibited a diagnostic sensitivity that was
considerably superior to that of BUN when the results were
correlated to the histopathological results.
Kidney-enriched miRNAs are readily detected in human
and animal urine
To serve as a biomarker, urinary miRNAs must be present at a
considerable concentration to be readily detected. Our study
clearly demonstrated that urinary miRNAs are stable and can be
reliably extracted and assayed by qRT-PCR. By comparing the
levels of miRNA in sera and urine, we found that kidney-enriched
miRNAs, such as miR-10a and miR-30d, were present in urine,
and their concentrations were approximately 1/10 of those in sera.
Importantly, when kidney injury occurred, the levels of miR-10a
and miR-30d in urine were strikingly elevated, while their levels in
the serum were not increased. These results strongly suggest that
urinary miR-10a and miR-30d can serve as ideal biomarkers for
kidney injury. We used both I/R-induced acute kidney injury and
STZ diabetes-induced chronic kidney injury animal models and
showed that changes in the levels of urinary miR-10a and miR￾30d occurred as a result of renal damage. Therefore, the relative
concentration of kidney-enriched miRNA species has a potential
to become a sensitive indicator for detecting and monitoring
kidney injury (Figure 2).
Because miR-10a and miR-30d are enriched in kidney tissue
(Figure 1), urinary miR-10a and miR-30d are probably derived
directly from the kidneys, particularly when kidney injury has
occurred. The recent work by Godwin et al. [11] showed that the
expression profile of kidney miRNAs was significantly changed
following renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). It is reasonable
to hypothesize that certain upregulated miRNAs in the kidney
may be released into the urine after IRI. Leakage of miRNAs from
damaged cells or tissue has been reported previously [14].
However, it could also be true that renal cells and tissues actively

release more miR-10a and miR-30d into circulation under the
stress. Recent studies by our group and others have shown that, in
response to various pathophysiological stimulations, cells can
actively package miRNA into microvesicles and release them into
circulation [30]. The high stability of urinary miRNAs suggests
that they may be primarily encapsulated in kidney cell-secreted
microvesicles.

Urinary miRNAs as Biomarkers for Kidney Injury
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51140

Urinary miRNAs are sensitive and specific indicators for
kidney injury
We demonstrated using well-established models that kidney
injuries can be precisely detected and monitored using a small
number of circulating miRNA species. In our study, this miRNA￾based method was more sensitive and probably more reliable than
the current BUN method for detecting kidney injury. Elevation of
the urinary miR-10a and miR-30d levels can be detected in mice
with unilateral I/R in which the protein levels were not changed,
suggesting that the urinary miR-10a and miR-30d levels can
reflect mild or early kidney injury. In addition, urinary miR-10a
and miR-30d are highly enriched to the kidney; therefore, the
elevation of these miRNAs may be directly linked to the injuries of
kidney. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that the
elevation of miR-10a and miR-30d concentrations occurred only
in urine and not in serum when mice were treated with renal I/R.
Interestingly, recent study by Lorenzen et al. [31] showed that
miR-10a was released into urine and could be detected in kidney
transplant patients at the onset of acute T-cell mediated rejection,
which may suggest a mild acute kidney injury during the process of
T-cell mediated rejection.
The role of tissue miR-10a and miR-30d in kidney function also
strengthens our conclusion that urinary miR-10a and miR-30d
can serve as indicators for kidney injury. Previous studies have
shown that miR-10a can target IL-12/IL-23p40 expression [32]
and pro-apoptotic protein Bim [33], while miR-30d can negatively
regulate apoptotic caspase CASP3 [34] and tumor suppressor p53
gene [35]. Through decreasing the levels of these apoptotic or pro￾apoptotic proteins and inflammatory cytokines, miR-10a and
miR-30d might provide a protection to kidney tissues/cells. In
contrast, reduction of miR-10a and miR-30d in kidney cells would
cause cell apoptosis and damage, which may finally lead to renal
dysfunction. Indeed, it has been reported that during nephrogen￾esis, nephron progenitors highly expressing miR-10a and miR-10a
can target Bim [24]. The study by Shi et al. [8] demonstrated that
podocytes strongly expressed four members of the miR-30 family
that may target genes such as vimentin, heat-shock protein 20 and
immediate early response 3. Through the silencing of these target
genes, the miR-30 and miR-10 miRNA families play an essential
role in podocyte homeostasis and podocytopathies, which is in
agreement with our finding in the present study. By measuring the
levels of miR-10a and miR-30d in mouse urine (Figure 2) and
mouse kidney tissue (Figure S3A) before and after kidney injury,
and comparing the levels of pre-miR-10a and pre-miR-30d in
kidney before and after kidney injury (Figure S3B), we found that
during kidney injury, elevation of urinary miR-10a and miR-30d
levels might be due to the leakage of miRNAs from the injured or
damaged kidney cells. In other words, the elevation of miRNAs in
urine is correlated to the reduction of miRNAs in kidney organs.
Therefore, an elevation of urinary miR-10a/miR-30d levels
correlates to a decrease of kidney miR-10a/miR-30d levels, which
links to cell apoptosis and kidney injury/damage. Serving as
negative regulators of cell apoptosis, miR-10a and miR-30d have
been found to be upregulated in various cancer tissues, such as
prostate cancer [36]. Clarifying the role of miR-10a and miR-30d
in the tumorigenesis processes of these cancer cells may be helpful
for understanding the correlation between urinary miR-10a/miR￾30d and kidney injures.
Interestingly, although the chronic hyperglycemia caused an
elevation of urinary miR-10a and miR-30d likely due to the kidney
damage, a short period of high blood glucose exposure did not
increase the level of these kidney-specific miRNAs in urine. By
challenging 12 h–fasting mice with an intraperitoneal injection of
glucose (2 g/kg of body weight), we found no elevation of urinary
miR-10a and miR-30d within 1–3 h (data not shown). These
results may suggest that the increase in urine miRNA levels in the
diabetes mouse model is not due to a glycosuria-induced osmotic
diuresis.
The results for the human urine samples further confirmed the
feasibility of using the urinary miR-10a and miR-30d levels to
detect kidney injury in humans. As shown in Figure 4, we found
that the urinary miR-10a and miR-30d levels in FSGS patients
were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers,
indicating the severity of the kidney injuries in these patients. In
summary, our study demonstrated that miR-10 and miR-30d are
stably present in human and animal urine and that the elevation of
the urinary miR-10a and miR-30d levels can serve as a novel
urine-based biomarker of kidney injury.
