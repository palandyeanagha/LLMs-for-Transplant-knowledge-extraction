ORIGINAL PAPER
ABSTRACT
Background & Aims: The disease course of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is variable and difficult 
to predict. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is associated with various liver diseases. We investigated the value of 
miR-122 as a biomarker for the disease course of PSC.
Methods: We determined serum miR-122 levels in a long-term, prospective cohort of 114 PSC patients and 
a second validation cohort. 
Results: Based on miR-122 levels, PSC patients were assigned to low or high level miR-122 groups. Kaplan￾Meier analysis showed significantly impaired actuarial transplant-free survival for PSC patients in the low 
miR-122 group (mean: 46.1 ± 4.1 months; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 38.1–54.2) compared to the high miR￾122 group (mean: 95.2 ± 7.9 months; 95% CI: 79.5–110.8; p = 0.034). Using a multivariate Cox’s proportional 
hazards model approach, Mayo-Risk score (odds ratio [OR]: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.13‒1.92; p = 0.004), the presence 
of dominant strictures (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.00‒5.55; p = 0.004), and serum miR-122 levels (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 
1.00‒1.43; p = 0.045) were independent risk factors associated with reduced actuarial transplant-free survival. 
We were able to confirm this finding in a second, independent cohort of PSC patients (low miR-122 group: 
mean survival: 13.1 ± 5.2 months; 95% CI: 2.8–23.4; high miR-122 group: mean: 28.62 ± 4.2 months; 95% 
CI: 20.3–37.0; p = 0.018). 
Conclusions: We identified miR-122 as a novel, independent prognostic biomarker associated with improved 
survival in PSC patients. It is unknown whether exogenous miR-122 might influence the disease course of 
PSC patients. 
Key words: miR-122 – primary sclerosing cholangitis – actuarial survival free of liver transplantation – 
biomarker.

variation [6, 7], the identification of prognostic factors for PSC 
patients is of utmost importance. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that 
post-transcriptionally control gene expression. They are 
expressed in multiple tissues and are important in multiple 
regulatory mechanisms including cell differentiation, 
proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis [8-10]. miR-122 
is primarily expressed in the liver and constitutes 70% of the 
total miRNA population [11]. Compared to its expression in 
healthy liver tissue, miR-122 expression is markedly reduced 
in hepatocellular carcinoma [12] and correlates with a poor 
patient prognosis [13]. Furthermore, miR-122 has been shown 
to regulate fat and cholesterol metabolism [14]. Recently, miR￾122 has also been associated with disease activity in chronic 
hepatitis C and drug-induced liver injury [15, 16]. Because

miR-122 alterations occur prior to changes in aminotransferase 
activity, it has been proposed as a predictive blood marker for 
viral-, alcohol-, and chemical-induced liver injury [17].
Interestingly, miR-122 deficiency shares certain 
commonalities with PSC as both demonstrate inflammatory 
recruitment abnormalities [18], cholestatic hepatobiliary 
disease [19], and ultimately lead to the development of liver 
fibrosis [19, 20]. Additionally, key enzymes involved in bile 
acid homeostasis are regulated by miR-122 [21]. Therefore, 
the aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value 
of serum miR-122 levels in a prospective, long-term cohort 
of PSC patients. 
METHODS
Study design
The prospective study began on May 1, 1987. Patients were 
included in this study until 2011 and clinical follow up was 
conducted until 2013. After obtaining written consent, serum 
samples were collected from 114 patients ultimately included 
in the study cohort (Table I). The study was approved by the 
Ethics Committee of the University of Heidelberg and informed 
consent to participate in the study was obtained from each 
subject in compliance with this committee. The study was 
carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
As previously described [22, 23], selection criteria for 
enrolling patients with PSC in the prospective study included 
typical endoscopic retrograde cholangiographic (ERC) 
findings, serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of at least 
twice the normal range, negative antimitochondrial antibody 
titers, and a liver biopsy compatible with the diagnosis 
of PSC. Exclusion criteria included decompensated liver 
cirrhosis, impending liver transplantation, a diagnosis of 
cholangiocellular carcinoma occurring within three months 
after presentation, and a history of neoplastic disease and/or 
hepatic comorbidity.
All subjects underwent a yearly physical examination, 
biochemical blood tests, and abdominal ultrasound. 
Additionally, all patients received treatment with 
ursodeoxycholic acid. The biliary system was evaluated with 
ERC in all patients upon entry into the study. In cases where 
dominant stenosis (DS) was present, ERC was repeated yearly. 
If there was no narrowing of the common bile duct at entry 
into the study, ERC was performed every two years until 1995. 
Since all patients with DS showed an increase in liver enzymes, 
starting in 1995, repeat ERC in patients without DS was only 
performed when AP or gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) 
increased ≥ 20%. A DS was defined as a common bile duct 
stenosis of < 1.5 mm diameter or a hepatic duct stenosis of < 
1.0 mm within 2 cm of the bifurcation. In patients with total 
or subtotal stenosis of the common bile duct and biochemical 
evidence of cholestasis, rigid dilatation followed by balloon 
dilatation of the stenosis was performed after endoscopic 
sphincterotomy of the papilla. In patients with dominant 
stenosis of the common bile duct, ERC was repeated at yearly 
intervals. Serum samples of prospective study cohort patients 
were obtained either at inclusion to the study or if not available 
at a later time point. For miRNA analysis, the serum samples 
obtained at the earliest time point after study inclusion were 
used. 
Patients in the second PSC study cohort were transferred 
to our center for evaluation of liver function and liver 
transplantation. Because these patients were consequently 
enrolled at Eurotransplant for liver transplantation, they were 
not included in the prospective study cohort. 
Blood sampling and miRNA determination
Blood serum samples were obtained between 8 to 9 a.m. in 
the fasted state. Blood samples were then immediately frozen 
at minus 80 degrees Celsius. Human RNA was extracted 
using the miRNeasy serum/blood plasma kit (Qiagen, Venlo, 
Netherlands), which utilizes phenol and chloroform, and 
plasma spiked with Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 mimic 
(Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) as a positive control. Human 
miR-122 expression was measured by quantitative real-time 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 
in a fluorescent temperature cycler using the TaqMan assay. 
Fluorescence was detected on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence 
detector (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Applied 
Biosystems’ TaqMan® miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life 
Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) was used together 
with TaqMan® miRNA Assay Primer for hsa-miR-122 to 
quantify the miRNA level. Since there are not established cut￾off values for miRNA-122 available, we decided to use the mean 
miRNA cycle threshold (CT)-levels (28.5) measured by RT￾qPCR for dichotomizing to miRNA-122 low- and high groups. 
Statistical analysis
The Student’s t-test was performed to compare the means of 
the two groups for continuous numerical data. Spearman‘s rho 
was used as the nonparametric measure of statistical dependence

between two variables. The actuarial liver transplant-free survival 
rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences 
between the actuarial liver transplant-free survival rate estimates 
were analyzed using the log-rank test. The following variables 
were selected for univariate analysis based on the results of 
previous studies: Mayo-Risk score, inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD), the presence of dominant strictures, and serum miR-122 
levels. A p-value of < 0.1 in univariate analysis was defined for 
variables to be included in a Cox’s proportional hazards model, 
using a stepwise procedure with a threshold of α = 0.05.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics in the prospective study cohort
The prospective study cohort consisted of 114 PSC patients 
of whom 34 were female (29.8%) and 80 were male (70.1%). 
Mean age at PSC diagnosis was 34.9 years (± 13.3). Twenty 
patients (17.5%) received liver transplantation while 7 patients 
(6.1%) died due to end-stage liver disease during follow-up. 
Mean follow up time from time of serum sampling was 79.5 
± 6.0 months (95% CI: 67.6–91.4).
Distribution of serum miR-122 levels in PSC patients
Time from blood sampling until miR-122 analysis after 
sample thawing was 78.9 ± 26.6 months. Figure 1 shows the 
distribution pattern of serum miR-122 levels. Based on the 
mean miRNA cycle threshold (CT)-levels (28.5) measured by 
RT-qPCR we dichotomized the patients into a low miR-122 
level group (CT-value > 28.5) and a high miR-122 level group 
(CT-value ≤ 28.5). There was no statistical difference regarding 
liver function parameters, liver transaminases, and cholestatic 
or inflammatory markers between the two groups at the 
beginning of the study (Table II). Notably, liver transplantation 
occurred significantly more often in the low miR-122 group 
(28.3% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.001).
Serum miR-122 levels as a marker for actuarial liver 
transplant-free survival in PSC patients
Actuarial liver transplant-free survival determined by 
Kaplan-Meier analysis was significantly impaired for PSC 
patients in the low miR-122 group (mean: 46.1 ± 4.1 months; 
95% CI: 38.1–54.2) compared to the high miR-122 group 
(mean: 95.2 ± 7.9 months; 95% CI: 79.5–110.8; p = 0.034) (Fig. 
2). While 24 patients (40.0%) with low miR-122 levels died 
or underwent liver transplantation, death or transplantation 
occurred in only 9 patients (16.6%) in the high miR-122 group.

III) and therefore subjected to further multivariate analysis. 
In multivariate analysis, Mayo-Risk score, the presence of 
dominant strictures, and serum miR-122 levels remained 
independent risk factors associated with reduced actuarial 
transplant-free survival. 
patients (19.0%) with high miR-122 levels died or received 
liver transplantation. 
DISCUSSION
Changes in hepatic and serum miR-122 levels have been 
associated with a variety of hepatic disorders such as alcoholic, 
viral, fibrotic, and fatty liver disease [24-28]. As miR-122 is 
stable and can be reliably detected in human sera [29], it has 
been proposed as a biomarker for hepatic disorders [30, 31]. 
Due to the highly unpredictable disease course of PSC patients 
[1], identification of reliable biomarkers is urgently needed, 
particularly since the only available cure is liver transplantation 
which may not be available to all patients. 
In this long-term, prospective study of PSC patients, we 
showed that a reduction of serum miR-122 levels is associated 
with impaired actuarial liver transplant-free survival, and 
demonstrated that miR-122 is an independent predictor of 
survival in PSC patients as shown by multivariate analysis 
(Table III). We were able to confirm this finding in a second, 
independent cohort of PSC patients. Reduction in alkaline 
phosphatase (AP) has recently been shown to be associated 
with longer survival in PSC [32]. Again, when subjected 
to multivariate analysis, both AP and miR-122 remained 
as independent predictors of survival. These findings 
are in agreement with a prior study showing that serum 
microRNA-122 predicts survival in patients with liver cirrhosis 
[33]. This association, however, was mainly attributed to end￾stage liver disease, as Waidman et al. [33] reported a highly 
significant correlation of liver function impairment and miR￾122 levels. In contrast to the study of Waidman et al. [33], 
patients with end-stage liver disease were not included in the 
prospective study cohort based on study protocol. Since miR￾122 levels did not correlate with Mayo-Risk score (Pearson 
correlation coefficient: -0.007; p = 0.940) at the beginning of 
the study, this indicates the predictive value of miR-122 in 
PSC patients. 
Interestingly, a deficiency of miR-122 shares common 
features of biliary damage. Six-month-old miR-122 knockout 
mice exhibit significantly increased serum AP and GGT levels, 
consistent with hepatobiliary disease [19]. Furthermore, 
cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and the canalicular bile 
salt export pump are protagonists in bile acid secretion and 
synthesis, both representing direct targets of human miR-122a 
[21]. Additionally, constitutively deficient miR-122 knockout 
mice show an increased recruitment of inflammatory cells such 
as CD11bhiGr1+, which are known to produce high levels 
of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α [18], ultimately 
resulting in liver fibrosis [19, 20]. It is intriguing to speculate 
that our observed correlation of miR-122 levels and impaired 
survival might be attributable to the increased inflammation 
observed with reduced miR-122 levels. 
An association of decreased miR-122 and the development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma has been widely reported. It has 
been presumed that miR-122 functions as a tumor-suppressor 
gene [13, 34]. In this respect, we observed a trend towards 
increased cholangiocarcinoma development in the low miR￾122 group compared to that in the high miR-122 group (5% vs. 
1.8% respectively, Table II). However, this was not statistically 
Subjection of AP and miR-122 levels to multivariate 
analysis showed that both factors were significantly associated 
with actuarial transplant-free survival (AP: 1.0 [1.001-1.003], 
p = 0.001; miR-122: 1.19 [1.02-1.40], p = 0.027). 
Patient characteristics in a second cohort of PSC patients
The second cohort consisted of 22 male and 8 female PSC 
patients (73.3% vs. 26.6%). Mean age of PSC diagnosis was at 
29.2 years (± 10.7). From the time of serum sampling, mean 
follow-up time in this cohort was 11.3 months (± 10.6). At 
time of serum sampling, Mayo-Risk score was 0.26 ± 1.1. Mean 
follow-up from the time of serum sampling was 27.6 months (± 
24.2). During the course of the PSC disease, 9 patients received 
liver transplantation while 1 patient died during follow-up due 
to end-stage liver disease. Mean follow up time from time of 
serum sampling was 23.3 ± 3.2 months (95% CI: 16.9–31.5).
Serum miR-122 levels in the second PSC cohort
Time from blood sampling until miR-122 analysis after 
sample thawing was 48.8 ± 11.7 months. In the second PSC 
cohort, serum miR-122 levels did not correlate with Mayo-Risk 
score (p = 0.115), serum bilirubin (p = 0.066), AST (p = 0.414), 
ALT (p = 0.311), GGT (p = 0.461), AP (p = 0.073), albumin (p 
= 0.842) and INR (p = 0.064). Patients were dichotomized into a 
low miR-122 level group (CT-value > 28.5) and a high miR-122 
level group (CT-value ≤ 28.5) as done in the prospective PSC 
cohort. Between these two cohorts, there were no statistical 
differences regarding clinical and serological parameters at the 
time of serum sampling (Supplemental Table I).
Serum miR-122 levels and actuarial liver transplant-free 
survival in the second cohort of PSC patients
Actuarial transplant-free survival was significantly 
impaired for patients with low miR-122 levels (mean: 13.1 ± 
5.2 months; 95% CI: 2.8–23.4) compared with that in those 
with high miR-122 levels (mean: 28.6 ± 4.2 months; 95% 
CI: 20.3–37.0; p = 0.018). While 6 patients (40.0%) with low 
miR-122 levels died or received liver transplantation, only 4

significant. Furthermore, we did not observe a correlation 
between miRNA-122 levels and the presence of IBD in this 
study. 
CONCLUSION
In this prospective, long-term PSC study, we demonstrated 
that serum miR-122 levels represent an independent predictor 
of transplant-free survival. It is unknown whether exogenous 
miR-122 can ameliorate the disease course of PSC patients, 
particularly taking into account that the therapeutic delivery of 
miRNA remains a major challenge. Future studies are required 
to validate these findings in the context of the timing of liver 
transplantation and as a substitute for interventional studies.
