Abstract
Background: Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous disease caused by deposition of amyloid fibrils in organs and thereby
interfering with physiological functions. Hardly any incidence data are available and most survival data are limited
to specialist clinics.
Methods: Amyloidosis patients were identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge and Outpatients Registers
from years 2001 through 2008.
Results: The incidence of non-hereditary amyloidosis in 949 patients was 8.29 per million person-years and the
diagnostic age with the highest incidence was over 65 years. Secondary systemic amyloidosis showed an incidence
of 1 per million and a female excess and the largest number of subsequent rheumatoid arthritis deaths; the median
survival was 4 years. However, as rheumatoid arthritis deaths also occurred in other diagnostic subtypes, the
incidence of secondary systemic amyloidosis was likely to be about 2.0 per million. The median survival of patients
with organ-limited amyloidosis was 6 years. Most myeloma deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with unspecified
or ‘other’ amyloidosis. These subtypes probably accounted for most of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis
cases; the median survival time was 3 years.
Conclusions: The present diagnostic categorization cannot single out AL amyloidosis in the Swedish discharge
data but, by extrapolation from myeloma cases, an incidence of 3.2 per million could be ascribed to AL amyloidosis.
Similarly, based on rheumatoid arthritis death rates, an incidence of 2.0 could be ascribed to secondary systemic
amyloidosis.
Background
Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous group of diseases charac￾terized by fibrillar protein deposits, amyloids, localized in a
single organ or systematically in many organs [1-3]. The
disease nomenclature is based on the precursors of the
amyloid fibrils for which at least 28 different proteins have
been identified [1,4,5]. The abbreviations for the amyloids
are constructed by starting with an ‘A’ for amyloid and add￾ing a suffix designating the precursor protein, e.g., AL is
amyloid derived from immunoglobulin light chain precur￾sor. AL amyloidosis is the respective disease which is the
most common systemic amyloidosis [2,4,6]. Other systemic
forms include reactive (AA with serum amyloid A as the
precursor) and senile (SSA, transthyretin) amyloidosis [4].
AA amyloidosis is a secondary condition in response to
chronic inflammation or even cancer; e.g., some 20% of
rheumatoid arthritis patients show some amyloid accumu￾lation in the course of their disease [7]. In a re-evaluated
Finnish autopsy series on rheumatoid arthritis deaths amyl￾oid was found in 30% of cases and amyloidosis was consid￾ered the cause of death in 9.5% of rheumatoid arthritis
patients [8,9]. According to causes of death in rheumatoid
arthritis patients, 5.8% have been ascribed to amyloidosis
but the proportion appears to be declining with time due
to a better control of the inflammation [6,10,11]. Alzhei￾mer disease is also a form of amyloidosis but because it is
an independent diagnostic entity it will not be considered
here. The most common and wide-spread hereditary amyl￾oidosis, familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), is caused
by transthyretin mutations [12,13]. However, hereditary
amyloidosis is outside the scope of the present study, and
will only be referred to in the context of diagnostic specifi￾city for non-hereditary amyloidosis.

The diagnosis is based on the demonstration of amyl￾oid fibrils in a tissue biopsy. In AL amyloidosis, the pres￾ence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin, M protein, can
usually be demonstrated in serum or urine samples. The
symptoms of amyloidosis arise in the critical organs
where amyloid accumulates, including the heart, kidney,
liver and peripheral nerves [4]. For AL amyloidosis car￾diac involvement is the most common life-threatening
manifestation. The median survival times depend on the
extent of interference with the critical organ functions
and these range from some months to some years, based
on patient clienteles of expert clinics [2,4]. AL amyloid￾osis is associated with multiple myeloma and probably
also with its precursor disease, monoclonal gammopathy
of unknown significance (MGUS); some 10 to 15% of
multiple myeloma patients have AL amyloidosis [14,15].
Conversely, some 10% of AL amyloidosis patients have
MM at the time of diagnosis [16].
There are limited data on the incidence of amyloidosis
probably because of the rarity and heterogeneity of the
condition. In 1992 Robert Kyle and coworkers wrote that
“...we are unaware of any published studies on the inci￾dence or prevalence of AL...” [17]. In that paper they gave
the incidence for AL amyloidosis in a US county overall as
9 per million person-years but the rate was based on 21
patients. This rate has been cited since then because appar￾ently no other incidence data have become available. In the
present study we report on the incidence of amyloidosis
based on nation-wide hospitalization in Sweden, covering
both inpatients and outpatients. Data are given by subtypes
between 2001 through 2008.
Methods
Source of data
Amyloidosis patients were identified from the Swedish
Hospital Discharge Register (2001–2008) or from the
Outpatients Register (2001–2008). The Hospital Dis￾charge Register has been operated regionally since 1964
and nationally since 1987. In order to ensure that the
reported incidence data included newly hospitalized
patients, anyone previously discharged with an amyloid￾osis diagnosis was excluded. Information from the regis￾ters was linked at the individual level via the national
10-digit civic registration number assigned to each per￾son in Sweden for his or her lifetime. In the linked data￾set, civic registration numbers were replaced by serial
numbers to ensure the anonymity of each individual.
Outcome variables
The 10th revision of the International Classification of
Diseases (ICD-10) was used to identify all first hospital
admissions for the outcome variables amyloidosis E85:
secondary systemic amyloidosis, E85.3; organ-limited
amyloidosis, E85.4; other amyloidosis, E85.8; and amyl￾oidosis, unspecified, E85.9. However, as amyloidosis
diagnostics is time consuming, the initial discharge may
be changed. We used therefore the discharge diagnosis
of the last hospitalization. Diagnostic details are not
included among the discharge data.
Individual variables
Sex: Males and females were included in the study. Geo￾graphic region of residence in 1990 was divided into (1)
large cities (cities with a population of more than
200,000, i.e., Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö); (2)
Southern Sweden; and (3) Northern Sweden. These data
were used in the adjustments as detailed below.
Statistical analysis
Person-years were calculated from the start of follow-up
on 1 January 2001, until hospitalization for amyloidosis,
death, emigration, or the closing date (31 December
2008). Age-, gender-, region of residence-, immigration
status-, and subtypes of diagnosis-specific incidence
rates were calculated for the whole follow-up period.
Relative weights used to calculate the incidence rates
were based on the 2000 European standard population.
We used SAS version 9.2 for the statistical analyses.
Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Lund University, Sweden.

total of 949 patients were identified, giving an incidence
of 8.29 per million person-years. Unspecified amyloidosis
was the largest disease category with 535 patients (inci￾dence 4.69/million), follow by secondary systemic amyl￾oidosis (136 patients, 1.18/million). Overall, men had a
somewhat higher incidence than women (1.3-fold for
unspecified amyloidosis), with the exception of second￾ary systemic amyloidosis for which the female incidence
was 1.9 times the male rate.
The age-specific rate of hospitalization for amyloidosis
is shown in Figure 1. Note that the scales of the y-axes
vary. Secondary systemic amyloidosis showed a sharp
male peak at age 70–74 years and a broader female peak
with younger cases (A). Organ-limited amyloidosis
reached a broad male maximum at age 65–79 years and
the female maximum somewhat earlier; both male and
female curves showed evidence on two main compo￾nents (B). ‘Other’ amyloidosis types followed the same
pattern (C) but for unspecified amyloidosis the male
maximum at 65–69 years occurred earlier than the
female maximum at 70–74 years (D).
Regional differences in the incidence of amyloidosis
were analyzed by residence as of year 1990 (data not
shown). The only significant differences (i.e., 95%CI did
not overlap with ‘All’, IR 3.84, 95%CI 3.55-4.14) were
found for unspecified amyloidosis for the provinces of
Uppsala (n= 36, IR 6.93, 95%CI 4.67-9.20) and the
neighboring province to the west, Västmanland (n= 38,
IR 6.67, 95%CI 4.55-8.78). Importantly, no excess cases
were found in the two northernmost provinces which
are the endemic area of FAP [13].
Causes of death were recorded for 1143 amyloidosis
patients hospitalized between years 1997 through 2008,
the longest period when subtypes were recorded
(Table 2). A total of 234 (21%) underlying causes of
death were due to amyloidosis and 328 (29%) were due
to other causes. Additionally, amyloidosis was given as a
contributing cause of death for 17 patients. Among
other underlying causes, deaths due to cancer were the
most common cause and accounted for 16/40 cases in
‘other’ amyloidosis and 68/182 for unspecified amyloid￾osis. Diseases of the circulatory system predominated for

secondary systemic and organ-limited amyloidosis. Mye￾loma would be pathognomonic of AL amyloidosis and it
accounted for 5 (secondary systemic amyloidosis), 0
(organ-limited amyloidosis), 12 (other amyloidosis) and
24 (unspecified amyloidosis) deaths among these four
subtypes, respectively. Incident myelomas were recorded
for 7, 3, 13 and 21 patients, respectively. Thus, assuming
that 10% of AL amyloidosis patients have myeloma at
diagnosis [16], the extrapolated AL amyloidosis case
numbers were 70 (37% of secondary systemic amyloid￾osis), 30 (22% of organ-limited amyloidosis), 130 (80% of
other amyloidosis) and 210 (32% of unspecified amyloid￾osis), adding up to 440 cases, which was 38% of all 1143
patients. Rheumatoid arthritis would be indicative of
secondary systemic amyloidosis; 14/85 (17%) deaths in
secondary systemic amyloidosis were due to rheumatoid
arthritis, which was far above unspecified amyloidosis
with 10/182 (5%) rheumatoid arthritis deaths.
For the estimation of the overall hospitalization rate
for amyloidosis, we compared previous hospitalizations
of the 197 patients whose underlying cause of death was
amyloidosis in years 2005 through 2008. Of these, 151
were hospitalized any time from 1964 onwards for amyl￾oidosis as the main or secondary diagnosis. Thus the
hospitalization rate was at least 77% for this group of
patients. However, the true rate is likely to be higher be￾cause the Hospital Discharge Registry reached nation￾wide coverage not earlier than 1987 and the Outpatient
Register was started in 2001 [18].
To assess the frequency of amyloidosis hospitalizations,
amyloidosis patients were identified from years 1997
through 2000 and they were scored for the number of
hospitalizations. Among 51 patients diagnosed with sec￾ondary systemic amyloidosis, 33 (65%) were hospitalized
once, 9 twice and 9 three or more times. Among 27
patients diagnosed with organ-limited amyloidosis, 14
(52%) were hospitalized once, 2 twice and 11 three or
more times. Among 39 patients diagnosed with other
amyloidosis, 19 (49%) were hospitalized once, 4 twice
and 16 three or more times. Among 125 patients diag￾nosed with unspecified amyloidosis, 50 (40%) were hospi￾talized once, 28 twice and 47 three or more times. This
population of 242 patients, first diagnosed between years
1997 and 2000, was also analyzed in terms of change of
amyloidosis diagnostic subtype between the first and the
last discharge diagnoses. A change was noted for 23
patients (9.5%); 15 of these were initially diagnosed with
unspecified amyloidosis, which was changed to ‘other’
amyloidosis among 7 patients and to hereditary amyloid￾osis among 4 patients (1.6% of 242 patients).
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for patients
first diagnosed between years 1997 to 2000 according to
their last discharge diagnosis from 1997 to 2008 (Figure 2).
Figure 2A shows the curves for secondary systemic amyl￾oidosis (median survival time 4 years) and unspecified
amyloidosis (median survival time 3 years). Figure 2B
shows the curves for organ-limited amyloidosis (median
survival time 6 years) and ‘other’ amyloidosis (median sur￾vival time 3 years).
Discussion
The present study helps to fill in the gap of knowledge
regarding the incidence of amyloidosis [17]. The advantages
include nation-wide coverage in a country of universal ac￾cess to medical services of high diagnostic standards. Many
patients were discharged more than once with the main
diagnosis amyloidosis, which implies consistent diagnostics.
Among those whose underlying cause of death was amyl￾oidosis, 77% had been earlier discharged with a diagnosis of
amyloidosis, which should provide a minimal estimate on
the degree of hospitalization of these patients in Sweden.
However, considering the seriousness of amyloidosis and

the related diagnostic challenges, it is likely that almost all
AL amyloidosis patients would be hospitalized. The accur￾acy of death certificates is also high in Sweden because
many deaths take place in hospitals and hospital records
are available to the death registrar in some 80% of the fatal￾ities in diseases covering amyloidosis [19].
Diagnostics of amyloidosis is difficult and time con￾suming, relying on tissue biopsy and microscopic exam￾ination [3]. Fine needle aspiration biopsy from a
symptom-giving organ can be used but subcutaneous
adipose tissue offers a safe and more convenient alterna￾tive which with Congo red staining has a diagnostic sen￾sitivity of 70 to 90% [3]. The diagnostic verification of AL
amyloidosis should involve multiple steps: immunofixa￾tion electrophoresis in combination with serum free light
chain assay to identify the light chain, followed by bone
marrow examination to exclude multiple myeloma and
Congo red staining of bone marrow or subcutaneous fat
to identify amyloid deposits; these procedures should
verify some 90% of patients [4]. It is understandable that
the diagnosis may change after the first hospital visit and,
for that reason, we used the last available discharge diag￾nosis. However, the changes appeared to be few, probably
because the amyloidosis subtypes categorized by the
ICD-10 codes were anyway non-specific and not inform￾ative of the nature of the amyloid fiber. The final diagnosis
of hereditary amyloidosis was found in only 1.6% of
patients with the initial diagnosis of unspecified amyloid￾osis. Hereditary amyloidosis FAP is well known in Sweden
because the country is one of the high prevalence areas for
FAP globally [12,13]. Reassuringly, the present patient
series showed no excess incidence in the two northernmost
provinces which are the endemic area of FAP [13]. Data
from the UK have shown that hereditary amyloidosis may
be misdiagnosed as AL amyloidosis [20].
Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the available dis￾ease classification in ICD-10 is not unambiguous. Based
on the observation that 10% of AL amyloidosis patients
have a concomitant myeloma [16], we calculated in
Results that AL amyloidosis would account for 38% of
all cases and correspond to an incidence of 3.2 per mil￾lion person-years. It was similarly assumed that AL
amyloidosis constituted some 80% of ‘other’ amyloidosis,
which showed a median survival time of 3 years. The
median survival for AL amyloidosis in an Italian clinic
was reported at 3.8 years but even shorter survival times
have been recorded, depending on the staging and
course of the disease [2,4,6]. The relatively favorable sur￾vival in the present study can also be explained by the
recent follow-up (after 2001) and the improvements of
treatment. Amyloidosis and myeloma treatments are
principally similar, and increases in myeloma survival
have been ascribed to the treatment [3,21].
Rheumatoid arthritis could be the main cause of sec￾ondary systemic amyloidosis. Indeed, the largest number
of rheumatoid arthritis deaths (14) occurred in secondary
systemic amyloidosis but an additional 10 deaths oc￾curred in unspecified amyloidosis. Further support for a
large rheumatoid arthritis etiology in secondary systemic
amyloidosis was the female excess and a relative good
survival. Thus, of the total amyloidosis incidence of 8.29
per million person-years, close to 1 per million could be
assigned to secondary systemic amyloidosis with a me￾dian survival of 4 years. However, an almost equal num￾ber of rheumatoid arthritis cases would be contributed
by unspecified amyloidosis and the best estimate for sec￾ondary amyloidosis incidence would be 2 per million per￾son-years. It is however clear that rheumatoid arthritis
related secondary amyloidosis is underdiagnosed or
underreported because there are some 50,000 hospita￾lized rheumatoid arthritis patients in Sweden since 1964
[22]. Accordingly, amyloidosis incidence in rheumatoid
arthritis patients in Finland has been 18 per million
person-years when systematic amyloid determination
was conducted [11]. The median survival time was 6

years in that study and it had been 3 years in an earlier
Finnish study which probably shows that the control of
the inflammation has a positive effect on survival [10,23].
This was confirmed in a recent study from Finland [24].
Senile amyloidosis is characterized by male excess and
age of onset higher than 65 years [4]. Practically all sub￾types in the present study were characterized by a high age
male incidence peak and it is not possible to assign any in￾cidence estimate to senile amyloidosis. Organ-limited
amyloidosis may be caused by many types of amyloid
deposits and it could not be assigned to a specific amyloid￾osis subtype [25]. The 6 year median survival for this group
is commensurate with limited disease severity.
Conclusions
This nation-wide study showed an incidence of 8.29 per
million person-years for non-hereditary amyloidosis in
Sweden. This is close to the incidence of AL amyloidosis
(9 per million) reported for the Mayo Clinic in the USA
[17]. Although the present diagnostic categorization was
too crude to single out AL amyloidosis in the Swedish
discharge data, we could extrapolate from myeloma rates
that the incidence of AL amyloidosis was 3.2 per million
person-years. The other disease entity that could be dis￾cerned was rheumatoid arthritis related secondary sys￾temic amyloidosis with an estimated incidence of 2 per
million. The unaccounted incidence of about 3 per mil￾lion person-years may be accounted for by senile amyl￾oidosis of the error margins of the above two
amyloidosis subtypes. We have reasons to believe that
these incidence figures were minimally influenced by
hereditary amyloidosis. Median survival ranged from 3
to 6 years and it was worse for the subtype with most
assumed AL cases. Amyloidosis epidemiology will be
boosted when the new amyloid fibril based disease no￾menclature will be taken to clinical use and supported
by diagnostic know-how [1].
