Dendritic cells (DCs) are central in regulating immune responses of kidney
ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and strategies to alter DC function may provide new
therapeutic opportunities. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) modulates immunity through
binding to its receptors (S1P1-5), and protection from kidney IRI occurs in mice treated
with S1PR agonist, FTY720 (FTY). We tested if ex vivo propagation of DCs with FTY
could be used as cellular therapy to limit the off-target effects associated with systemic
FTY administration in kidney IRI. DCs have the ability of regulate innate and adaptive
responses and we posited that treatment of DC with FTY may underlie improvements in
kidney IRI. Herein, it was observed that treatment of bone marrow derived dendritic cells
(BMDCs) with FTY induced mitochondrial biogenesis, FTY-treated BMDCs (FTY-DCs)
showed significantly higher oxygen consumption rate and ATP production compared to
vehicle treated BMDCs (Veh-DCs). Adoptive transfer of FTY-DCs to mice 24 h before or
4 h after IRI significantly protected the kidneys from injury compared to mice treated with
Veh-DCs. Additionally, allogeneic adoptive transfer of C57BL/6J FTY-DCs into BALB/c
mice equally protected the kidneys from IRI. FTY-DCs propagated from S1pr1-deficient
DCs derived from CD11cCreS1pr1fl/fl mice as well as blunting mitochondrial oxidation in
wildtype (WT) FTY-DCs prior to transfer abrogated the protection observed by FTY-DCs.
We queried if DC mitochondrial content alters kidney responses after IRI, a novel but little
studied phenomenon shown to be integral to regulation of the immune response. Transfer
of mitochondria rich FTY-DCs protects kidneys from IRI as transferred FTY-DCs donated
their mitochondria to recipient splenocytes (i.e., macrophages) and prior splenectomy
abrogated this protection. Adoptive transfer of FTY-DCs either prior to or after ischemic
injury protects kidneys from IRI demonstrating a potent role for donor DC-mitochondria
in FTY’s efficacy. This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that DCs have the potential
to protect against kidney injury by donating mitochondria to splenic macrophages to alter
their bioenergetics thus making them anti-inflammatory. In conclusion, the results support

that ex vivo FTY720-induction of the regulatory DC phenotype could have therapeutic
relevance that can be preventively infused to reduce acute kidney injury.

INTRODUCTION
The pathogenesis of kidney injury following kidney ischemia
reperfusion (IR) involves a complex interaction between
altered microcirculatory hemodynamics, renal parenchymal cells
(endothelial and epithelial) and infiltrating immune cells (1, 2).
Dendritic cells (DCs), the major leucocyte subset in the kidney
(3–5), contributes to both the innate and adaptive immunity
of kidney IR injury (IRI) (6) through aberrant activation of
immune cells (7–9). Considerable data supports that the immune
system mediates acute kidney injury (AKI) (10), yet many of
the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. In preclinical
mouse models, anti-inflammatory pharmacologic treatments
have been shown to significantly attenuate tissue injury and
loss of function (11–14). However, the side effects of these
common anti-inflammatory therapies combined with the lack
of clinical data, supporting the involvement of the immune
system in AKI pathogenesis, have hindered the development
of clinically tenable anti-inflammatory options. Therefore, as of
now dialysis remains the only treatment option available to AKI
patients, underscoring the need to develop novel approaches
to tackle this hurdle to ultimately improve patient quality
of life.
Our previously published work using mouse models of
AKI (13, 14) and others (15, 16) have demonstrated that
modulation of Sphingosine 1 Phosphate receptors (S1PRs)
significantly influences AKI development and thus progression
to chronic kidney injury. These receptors belong to a family
of five G-protein coupled receptors (S1pr1-5) that modulate
diverse physiological responses including “cellular growth
and proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and lymphocyte
trafficking” (17–20). Similar levels of S1PRs are expressed
on both human and mouse leukocytes (21–23). FTY720,
a potent immunosuppressant and a synthetic S1P agonist
is currently in clinical trials for treatment of autoimmune
diseases (24) and is effective in reducing graft rejection in
preclinical mouse models (25, 26) because it mediates a potent
immunosuppression. Phosphorylated-FTY720 (FTY720-P),
the active form of FTY720, is a non-selective S1P analog
that binds and activates four (S1PR1, 3–5) of the five known
receptors for S1P (24, 27). FTY720-dependent protection or
diminished disease severity has been demonstrated in varied
acute and chronic disease models, such as diabetes (28–33),
multiple sclerosis [MS, review (34)], ischemic injury (35–46),
and even clearance of viral infection (47). To date, FTY720
is currently used as FDA-approved treatment (Gilenya) of
MS patients (48). In our previously published work, we have
shown that this pan-S1PR agonist, FTY720, attenuated kidney
IRI by directly activating S1P1 on proximal tubule (PT) cells,
independent of its previously known function through binding
to S1P1 on B and T cells to induce canonical lymphopenia
(14). FTY720 also reduces cisplatin-induced AKI (49). Deletion
of S1P1 renderers cultured and kidney PT epithelial cells
more susceptible to cisplatin-induced injury (49), whereas
overexpression of S1P1 protected PT cells from injury and
resistance to cisplatin induced cell death at lower doses (49).
One potential mechanism that we previously reported to
mediate S1P1 protection in IRI and cisplatin-induced AKI
was through possible induction of mitochondrial biogenesis
that resulted in higher mitochondria numbers and ultimately
preserved kidney function (49). Thus, we previously concluded
in these published studies that S1P1 had a central role in
stabilizing mitochondrial function and FTY720 administration
could represent a novel strategy in the prevention of
AKI (14, 49).
However, use of pharmacological agents such as FTY720 has
limitations due to off-target (binding to other S1P receptors)
and other associated adverse side effects. On the other hand,
cell-based therapeutic approaches have advantages; transferred
cells are capable of sensing diverse signals, navigating to
specific sites in the body, make immunological decisions
and executing complex responses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are
heterogeneous, professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and
are distributed throughout the lymphoid and non-lymphoid
tissues (50). Our previous studies demonstrated that S1P3
deficient (S1pr3−/−) mice are protected from renal IRI through
a mechanism that involved BMDCs and their ability to
respond as immune modulators to regulate innate and adaptive
immune responses (13). Additionally, we had also tested
the therapeutic advantage of using S1pr3−/− BMDC in DCs
transfer studies in mouse kidney IRI model. Compared to
mice treated with wild-type (WT) DCs that had significant
rise in plasma creatinine, mice that received S1pr3−/− DCs
were significantly protected from kidney IRI (12, 13). S1pr3−/−
DCs did not attenuate IRI in splenectomized, Rag1−/−, or DC￾depleted (CD11c-DTR) mice (12) demonstrating that both spleen
derived cells, likely macrophages (CD169+ or F4/80+) or DCs
(CD11c+ or CD103+) and T cells (CD4+ and Tregs) mediated
this protection.
The aim of this study was to determine the potential
protective mechanism(s) of FTY720 stimulated BMDCs in a
preclinical mouse model of kidney IRI. Treatment of BMDCs
ex vivo with FTY720 avoids any adverse off-target effects
associated with systemic drug injections. Herein, we demonstrate
that FTY720 treated BMDCs (FTY-DC) accumulate in the
recipient spleen as early as 30 min after adoptive transfer of
cells via intravenous injection. FTY-DC mitochondrial content
was elevated in vitro, and we posit that transfer of FTY￾DC mitochondria to splenic macrophages occurs. Indeed, in
spleen, FTY-DC interaction with splenic macrophages (CD169+
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1278

Rousselle et al. Transfer of FTY-DC Prevents Kidney IRI
and F4/80+) was evident. Transplant of mitochondria from
FTY-DC reprogrammed macrophage phenotype; macrophages
were less immunogenic upon inflammatory stimuli in vivo
and in vitro. Depletion of DC-derived mitochondria through
varied approached demonstrated that oxidative capacity of
DC was critical to protection from AKI in response to
IRI. Splenectomy or pharmacologic ablation of mitochondrial
function with combination treatment with rotenone and
antimycin A (Rot/AA) of FTY-DC abrogated the protection
observed with FTY-DCs. Likewise, inhibiting FYT720 agonism
using S1P1 receptor deficient DCs (CD11cCreS1pr1fl/fl
) also
reversed FTY-DC therapeutic efficacy. Overall, the interactions
between FTY-DC and splenocytes (macrophage) demonstrated
that induction of the anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
phenotype led to reduced injury, an effect that required the
recipient spleen. Of note, adoptive transfer of DC worked
equally well in allogeneic IRI model (C57BL/6 BMDC →
BALB/c mice), suggesting that this cell-based therapy can
be efficacious in transplantation. Finally, we provide seminal
findings that DCs are mitochondrial donors which illustrate a
novel mechanism of how DCs regulate innate immune responses
in acute injury.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
All animals were handled, and procedures were performed
in adherence to the National Institutes of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all protocols
were approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science
Center and University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees. CD11cCre mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar
Harbor, ME) were purchased and S1pr1fl/fl
generously provided
by Dr. Richard L. Proia, NIH. The lines were crossed and
bred as fl/fl with Cre to generate CD11cCreS1pr1wt/wt (control)
or CD11cCreS1prfl/fl
(DC specific S1pr1 knockout) littermates.
Phamfl/fl mice (51) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were
bred with CD11cCre to obtain CD11cCrePhamfl/fl mice. For all
transfer studies C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice were purchased from
the National Cancer Institute, NCI (Frederick, MD). Mice were
maintained in standard vivarium housing with a 12 h light/dark
cycle on a chow diet and water was freely available.
Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury and
Splenectomy (SPLNX)
Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
a ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg) mixture
and buprenorphine (0.15 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) was
administered as an analgesic and placed on a warm pad to
maintain body temperature at 34.5–36◦C. Mice were then
randomized to sham or IRI operation. Bilateral flank incision
was performed and either the renal vessels (vein and artery)
on both sides or only on the left side were cross-clamped.
Body temperature was checked and maintained throughout
the ischemic period using ATC-2000 system (World Precision
Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Sham-operated mice underwent the
same procedure except for vessel clamping and surgical wounds
were closed. Male mice (8–12 wk old, C57BL/6 and BALB/c)
were subjected to bilateral IRI (26 min ischemia for C57BL/6
and 28 min for BALB/c mice followed by 20–24 h reperfusion) as
previously described (3, 7, 52). Mice that had one kidney with no
reperfusion 24 h after ischemia were excluded from all analysis.
For experiments that involved splenectomy (Splnx) prior to
IRI, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg). The spleen was
then removed through a small flank incision. Control, sham￾operated mice underwent the same procedure except for splenic
artery ligation and spleen removal. Sham and splenectomized
mice recovered for 7 days prior to BMDC transfer for
IRI studies.
Assessment of Kidney Function and
Histology
Blood was collected under anesthesia from the retro-orbital
sinus, and plasma creatinine (mg/dL) was determined by
using an enzymatic method with minor modifications from
the manufacturer’s protocol (twice the volume of sample;
Diazyme Laboratories, Poway, CA) and as previously reported
(53). For histology, kidneys were fixed overnight in 0.2%
sodium periodate-1.4% DL-lysine-4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (4% PLP) and embedded in
paraffin. Kidneys were prepared for Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining as previously described (3) and viewed by
light microscopy (Zeiss AxioSkop). Photographs were taken
and brightness/contrast adjustment was made with a SPOT RT
camera (software version 3.3; Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling
Heights, MI). For quantification of tubular injury score, sections
were assessed by counting the percentage of tubules that
displayed cell necrosis, loss of brush border, cast formation, and
tubule dilation as follows: 0 = normal; 1 = <10%; 2 = 10 to
25%; 3 = 26 to 50%; 4 = 51 to 75%; 5 = >75%. Five to 10 fields
from each outer medulla were evaluated and scored in a blinded
manner. The histological change was expressed as acute tubular
necrosis (ATN), scored as previously described (13, 54).
Immunohistochemical Analysis
Kidneys were fixed in 1% PLP (as above except 1%
paraformaldehyde) overnight, incubated in 30% sucrose for
24 h at 4◦ C, and embedded and frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT
Compound (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA). Frozen sections
(5–7µm) were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and
non-specific binding was blocked with 10% horse serum and rat
anti-mouse CD16/32 (10µg/ml; clone 2.4G2; BD Pharmingen,
San Jose, CA). Sections were labeled by incubation for 1 h with
anti-mouse F4/80 (5µg/ml; clone BM8, Molecular probes,
Fredrick, MD), anti-mouse CD169 (7µg/ml; clone 3D6.112,
BioLegend, San Diego, CA), anti-mouse CD169 (7µg/ml; clone
MOMA-1; AbD Serotec/BioRad, Raleigh, NC). All specimens
were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to label cell nuclei. Images were
acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscopy system with
ApoTome imaging and Axiovision 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy, Thornwood, NY).

Bone Marrow (BM)-Derived-Dendritic Cell
(DC) Culture and Adoptive Transfer
Eight week old C57BL/6J WT, CD11cCreS1prfl/fl
,
CD11cCrePhamfl/fl
S1pr3−/− male mice were used for generating
DCs from whole BM precursors (55). GMCSF-rich supernatant
was derived from J558L cells stably transfected with mouse
GMCSF. The cell line was a generous gift from Dr. Ira Mellman
(Dept. of Biology, Yale University). Briefly, freshly isolated
BM was cultured with 6 ng/ml recombinant mouse GMCSF
(total of 3 treatments) for 8 days in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen).
Eighty to Ninety percentage of resulting cells were CD11c+ DCs
as determined by flow cytometry with CD11c antibody. The
optimal dose of 1µM FTY720 was decided after testing various
doses (0.1–10µM). Similar to studies done by Zeng et al. (56)
FTY720 treated BMDCs were tested for drug induced cellular
toxicity (apoptosis) and changes in co-stimulatory molecules
(CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHCII) after overnight treatment
with LPS. BMDC were treated with 1µM FTY720 (total of
4 treatments) that was purchased from Cayman Chemicals
(Ann Arbor, Michigan). BM-derived DCs were treated with
TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli serotype
0111:B4; 25 or 100 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich); or vehicle (1x PBS)
for 24 h in culture medium for syngeneic studies (C57BL/6J
BMDCs→ C57BL/6J mice) and left untreated for allogenic
studies (C57BL/6J BMDCs→ BALB/c mice). See timeline in
Supplemental Figure 1. Cells were washed, and 0.5 × 106
cells
per mouse were i.v. injected to naive mice 1 day before or in some
studies 4 h after kidney IRI. Griess Reagent system (Promega)
was used to detect nitrate in media after LPS stimulation. BMDCs
were labeled with MitoTracker CMXRos Red or MitoTracker
Green (50–100 nM, 30 min @ 37◦C, Invitrogen) or Mitosox
(5µM; 10 min @ 37◦C; Invitrogen) prior to fixing with 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for 30 min.
Actin was labeled with phalloidin-FITC (2.5µg/ml; Sigma).
Nuclei were visualized using DAPI. All specimens were mounted
with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen).
Images were acquired using the Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscopy
system with ApoTome imaging and Axiovision software (Carl
Zeiss Microscopy LLC, Thornwood, NY). RAW264.7 cells were
purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in
DMEM (Invitrogen).
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was isolated and reversed transcribed to cDNA, and
RT-PCR was performed as previously described (13, 49, 57).
Primers span an exon-exon junction and were designed with
Primer-BLAST (NCBI). Pgc1a, NM_008904.2, 5′GCTCTTCCTT
TAACTCTCCGTGTC3′
and 5′CTTGACCTGGAATAT GGTG
ATCGG (53). Relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expression
level was measured as previously described (58). Briefly, total
genomic DNA was isolated and equal amounts (5 ng) was used
for RTPCR using ND1 as surrogate primers for mtDNA and
HK2 primers for nuclear DNA (nDNA) for mouse and ND6 for
human mtDNA as previously described (58, 59). Total number of
mtDNA copies was determined by following formula, delta Ct =
nDNA gene (Ct)- mtDNA (Ct); mtDNA copy = 2 × 2
δCt (58).
Mitochondria Isolation and Quantification
Mitochondria were isolated from mouse liver or BMDCs as
previously described (60). Briefly, 2 pieces of ∼6 mm mouse liver
biopsies were homogenized using homogenization buffer (300
mmol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L HEPES-KOH, 1 mmol/L EGTA￾KOH, pH 7.4) in a C tube (Miltenyi Biotec, Cambridge, MA)
with GentlyMACS dissociator using the “m-mito tissue” pre￾set program. The homogenate was incubated on ice for 10 min
with 1 mg Subtilisin A protease from Bacillus licheniformis
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The digested homogenate
was serially filtered through 2 × 40µm Falcon Cell Strainers
(Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) and 1 × 10µm PluriSelect
mesh (PluriSelect, San Diego, CA) that was saturated with ice
cold homogenization buffer. Mitochondria were collected by
centrifuging the filtrate at 3,500 × g at 4◦C for 10 min and re￾suspended in cold 1x PBS for further use. Protein concentration
of isolated mitochondria were determined using Bradford
assay according to manufacture recommendations. Isolated
mitochondria were kept on ice and used within 1 h after isolation.
In some experiments isolated mitochondria were sonicated
and kept on ice before injecting, all isolated mitochondria
were injected within 1 h of isolation. ATP concentrations of
isolated mitochondria were using luminescent CellTiter-Glo
reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Isolated mitochondria were injected (i.v.; 0–100 µg/mouse) 1 day
before spleen was harvested for single cells preparation for in
vitro stimulation with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 h. RAW264.7 cells
(TIB-71, ATCC, Old Town Manassas, VA) were treated with
isolated mitochondria (with and without sonication, 10µg/ml)
from DCs for 24 h before stimulating with LPS (100 ng/ml)
or analysis with Seahorse Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA).
Seahorse Flux Bioanalyzer
Seven day old BMDCs were transferred to a Seahorse 24-
well tissue culture plates and oxygen consumption rate (OCR)
was measured, and parameters were calculated as previously
described (49) with the following modification. Prior to the
assay, the media was changed to unbuffered DMEM (Gibco
#12800-017, pH 7.4, 37◦C), and cells were equilibrated for 30 min
at 37◦C. After measuring basal respiratory rate, Oligomycin
(Sigma; 2µM; uncouples ATP-coupled respiration by inhibiting
ATP synthase), FCCP (Sigma; 1.5µM; carbonyl cyanide
4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), mitochondrial
uncoupling agent; uncouples mitochondrial respiration from
ATP to determine maximal respiratory rate), and electron
transport chain (complex I and III) inhibitors, rotenone (Sigma;
0.5µM) and antimycin A (Sigma; 0.5µM; to eliminate all
mitochondrial respiration) were injected sequentially during the
assay. OCR was measured in 3 min periods of time (over a
total period of 2 h). Basal mitochondrial respiration, ATP-linked
respiration, proton leak (non-ATP linked oxygen consumption),
maximal respiration, non-mitochondrial respiration, reserve
respiratory capacity, respiratory control ratio, and coupling
efficiency were determined in whole cells according to Brand et al.
(61), N = 4–5 wells were used for each experimental group and
experiments were repeated a minimum of 3 times.

Rousselle et al. Transfer of FTY-DC Prevents Kidney IRI
Flow Cytometric Analysis, Western Blot,
ELISA, and 32-Plex Luminex
Flow cytometry was used to analyze kidney leukocyte content.
In brief, kidneys were extracted, minced, and digested (1
mg/ml collagenase) as described (7). After blocking nonspecific
Fc binding with anti-mouse CD16/32 (2.4G2), fresh kidney
suspensions were incubated with fluorophore-tagged anti-mouse
CD45 (30-F11) to determine total leukocyte cell numbers.
CD45-labeled samples were further used for labeling with
different combinations of fluorophore-tagged anti-mouse
F4/80 (BM8), GR-1 (Ly6G), CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (integrin
alpha X chain-HL3). 7-AAD (BD Biosciences) was added
15 min before analyzing the sample to separate live from
dead cells. Appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated, isotype￾matched, irrelevant mAbs were used as negative controls.
Flow cytometry data acquisition was performed on a FACS
Calibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with Cytek 8-color
flow cytometry upgrade (Cytek Development, Inc., Fremont,
CA). Data were analyzed by FlowJo software 9.0 (Tree Star,
Ashland, OR). All antibodies (except as noted) were from
eBioscience and were used at a concentration of 5µg/ml.
ELISA: Media was collected from BMDCs or splenocytes
treated for 6 or 24 h with wither 25 or 100 ng/ml LPS. TNFα
levels were measured by using mouse ELISA kits (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. BMDCs
treated with and without LPS for 24 h were used to isolated
total protein using RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Vernon Hills, IL). Equal volumes of the lysate
supernatants were either boiled for 10 min at 100◦C for
GAPDH) or left at room temperature for 10 min for rodent
OXPHOS cocktail (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) with Laemmli
buffer and β-mercaptoethanol. Total of 20 µg of proteins
were separated using a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred
to PVDF membranes. PVDF membranes were incubated
overnight with primary antibody for GAPDH (1:1000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and rodent OXPHOS cocktail (1:1000).
Blots were then washed and incubated at 1:4000 for 1 h with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary
antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized
by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer’s protocol
with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified by Image J. The
Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-Plex Immunoassay was used
to check serum levels 24 h after bilateral kidney IRI (BioRad,
Hercules CA).
Data and Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Inc.), SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat
Software Inc.), and Canvas X (ACD Systems of America
Inc.) were used to analyze and present the data. Data were
analyzed, after transformation if needed to generate a normal
distribution, by 2-tailed t-test or 1-way ANOVA with post￾hoc analysis as appropriate. Two-tailed unpaired t-test was
used for analysis of two groups. p < 0.05 was used to
indicate significance.

RESULTS
FTY720 Induces Metabolic
Reprogramming in WT BMDCs
WT DCs were isolated and propagated for 8 days in presence
of GMCSF and vehicle (1X PBS) or FTY720 (1µM). Eight day
old DCs were labeled with MitoTracker CMXRos Red (50 nM).
Compared to vehicle treatment, FTY720 treatment increased
mitochondrial content in BMDCs (Figure 1A). Similarly, there
was significantly higher labeling for MitoSox (5µM) and
MitoTracker Green (100 nM) after over-night LPS stimulation
in FTY-DC compared to Veh-DC (Figure 1B). FTY-DCs
displayed significantly elevated mRNA levels for peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha
(Pgc1a) in response to LPS, but this LPS-induction was absent
in Veh controls (Figure 1C). To determine if the changes
in mitochondrial content also altered mitochondrial function,
bioenergetic analysis was undertaken. LPS blunted oxygen
consumption compared to Veh controls in Veh-DCs as expected
(Figure 1D, blue to black line) (62). Interestingly, FTY-DCs
have higher basal OCR (Figure 1D, green to blue line at
time zero). Upon treatment with uncoupler FCCP, FTY-DC
demonstrate a failure to increase maximal respiratory capacity
in unstimulated cells that is even more reduced with LPS
stimulation demonstrating that FTY ablates spare respiratory
capacity (likely because already at maximal OCR in basal
state). When ATP production was quantified, LPS reduced ATP
production as measured by OCR (blue to black). FTY-DC
demonstrated significantly greater ATP production compared
to Veh-DC in both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated DCs
(Figure 1E). These data indicate that propagation of BMDCs
in presence of FTY720 increased mitochondrial content, basal
OCR, and ATP production. This suggests the potential for an
anti-inflammatory phenotype in DCs.
FTY720 Induces Immune Reprogramming
in WT BMDCs
LPS stimulation of BMDCs increased expression of enzymes
(iNOS) and cytokines typical of pro-inflammatory DCs. FTY￾DC dramatically blunted LPS-induced iNOS expression and
nitrate in media compared to Veh-DC (Figures 1F,G). Likewise,
FTY significantly blunted expression of LPS-induced Il1b and
Tnfa and protein concentrations of TNFα compared Veh-DC
treated with LPS (Figures 1H–K). Il12p40 gene expression was
not regulated by FTY (data not shown). In contrast, Il10, a
cytokine often associated with anti-inflammatory immune cells
was significantly increased by LPS but only in FTY treated cells
(Figure 1I). Interestingly, after LPS treatment, FTY-DC have
significantly lower expression levels of co-stimulatory antigen
presentation molecules (CD80, CD86, and CD40) and MHCII
compared to Veh-DC (Supplemental Figure 1). Interestingly,
FTY-DCs had lower expression level for PDL1 compared to Veh￾DCs and maintained the PDL1/CD86 ratio after LPS stimulation
compared to LPS treated Veh-DCs (Supplemental Figure 1).
No significant changes in CD11c expression was observed
between Veh- and FTY-DCs, although FTY-DC had lower
side scatter signal indicating smaller size of cells after LPS
stimulation (data not shown). FTY-DCs had higher relative
mtDNA levels compared to Veh-DCs (106 ± 13.03 vs. 165.9
± 20.6). Additionally, we measured total protein changes in
mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes (I-V) in Veh- and FTY￾DCs treated overnight with 100 ng/ml LPS. FTY-DCs have
higher protein levels of different mitochondrial complexes
compared to Veh-DCs with and without LPS treatment
(Supplemental Figures 1H–J) especially in levels of complex IV
(MTCO1) a protein that is encoded by mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA). Mitochondria complex IV was significantly higher in
vehicle treated FTY-DC compared to vehicle treated Veh-DC
(0.10 ± 0.01 vs. 0.49 ± 0.01, p < 0.01) and after LPS treatment
(0.04 ± 0.003 vs. 0.16 ± 0.01, p < 0.01) along with higher complex
III after LPS treatment (Supplemental Figure 1J).
Transfer of FTY-DC Protects Kidneys From
Ischemic Injury
All DCs were activated with 100 ng/ml LPS prior to transfer in
all syngeneic studies (B6 BMDC to B6 mice). Half a million DCs
were injected 1 day before bilateral kidney IRI. As control, mice
were injected with 1x PBS as no cell (NC) controls. Compared to
NC and Veh-DC treated mice, FTY-DC treated mice significantly
protected the kidneys from injury (Figure 2A). Morphological
changes (Figure 2B) paralleled functional studies. FTY-DC
treatment resulted in less infiltration of immune cells (CD45
labeled) compared to Veh-DC or NC treated mice (Figure 2C).
Quantitative analysis with flow cytometry further demonstrates
that FTY-DC treated mice have few neutrophil infiltrations
compared to NC or Veh-DC treated mice (Figures 2D–F). To
determine if kidney injury genes along with S1pr1 were regulated
we measured by qRT-PCR relative kidney levels in DC treated
mice. Mice treated with FTY-DC have significantly lower kidney
mRNA levels for S1pr1, Ngal, Kim1, and lower levels for Il6
(Figure 2G). These data indicate that FTY-DC treated mice have
significantly less inflammation (cytokine levels) that results in
less infiltration of innate immune cells (PMNs) after kidney IRI.
The expression levels of S1pr1 increase after IRI compared to
sham operated mice in a time dependent manner (54), possibility
indicating initiation of compensatory mechanism due ischemic
injury. Plasma samples from Veh- and FTY-DC treated mice
were check 24 h after bilateral ischemia using 23-plex Luminex.

Only 8 out of 23 cytokines showed low levels of signal. There were
no significant changes in circulating levels of MCP-1, IL-9, LIX,
or Eotaxin, although trends were toward lower levels in FTY-DC
treated mice. Only 3 cytokines were significantly lower (pg/ml;
KC [382.06 ± 99.7 vs. 87.22 ± 19.4, p < 0.05], IL-1a [508.2 ±

Injected DCs Transfer Mitochondria to
Splenic Macrophages
Next to evaluate if DCs transfer mitochondria to recipient
cells we harvested BMDCs from CD11cCrePhamfl/fl mice that
contain a fluorescent tag in their mitochondria (Figure 3A).
Half a million Veh-DC or FTY-DC that were propagated
from CD11cCrePhamfl/fl mice were i.v. injected and signal
in spleen was evaluated 30 min or 24 h after injection. The
spleen was labeled with anti-CD169 to identify marginal zone
(MZ) and anti-F4/80 for red pulp (RP) macrophages and
no antibody labeled area are labeled as white pulp (WP)
(Figures 3B,C). Some green fluorescence signal indicative of
mitochondria exchange from DCs to macrophages in CD169+
cells at the 30 min after injection time point was evident (data
not shown). Strong signal in proximity and inside the various
splenic macrophages at 24 h from injected DCs is demonstrated
(Figures 3B,C). In addition to possibly more mitochondria
transfers from FTY-DC, it appears there is disruption in the
MZ macrophages (CD169) with FTY-DC treatment along with
more mitochondria signal in red pulp compared to Veh-DC
(Figure 3C). This disruption in MZ macrophages in mice treated
with FTY-DC could possibly be due to similar mechanism
that we have previously demonstrated using S1pr3−/− DCs;
that ultimately result in higher CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs in white
pulp (12).
Splenectomy (Splnx) Abrogates FTY-DC
Dependent Protection
Since abundant signal from injected DCs (CD11cCrePhamfl/fl
)
was found in spleen, to determine if spleen was important in
FTY-DC-dependent protection after kidney IRI, mice underwent
either sham or Splnx surgeries and were allowed to recover for
7 days. On day 8, half a million LPS treated either Veh-DC
or FTY-DCs were injected 1 day before bilateral kidney IRI,
as above. In absence of spleen, FTY-DC dependent protection
was completely abrogated (Figure 4A). Histological evaluation
also showed dramatic FTY-DC-dependent protection of kidney
architecture (Figures 4B,C). Quantitative analysis with flow
cytometry further demonstrates that FTY-DC treated Sham mice
have few neutrophil infiltrations compared to Veh-DC treated
mice (Figures 4D,E), no changes in neutrophil percentage or
numbers was observed in Splnx-FTY-DC treated mice. In
addition to involvement of innate immune cells (macrophages)
as possible mitochondria recipients from injected DCs, it is
plausible that DCs could donate mitochondria to other adaptive

FTY-DC Dependent Protection

FIGURE 5 | FTY-DC require S1pr1 on BMDC to protect kidneys from IRI. (A) Protocol for experimental setup. FTY720 is a ligand for four out of five S1P receptors.
Plasma creatinine (PCr, mg/dL) was measured 24 h after IRI. We tested if S1pr1 or S1pr3 were requited for FTY720 dependent regulatory DC phenotype. BMDCs
were propagated from either C57BL/6 WT, CD11cCreS1pr1fl/fl
(S1pr1−/− DC), or S1pr3−/− and treated with FTY720. FTY-S1pr1−/− DC do not protect kidneys from
IRI. As demonstrated in our earlier published studies and again confirmed, transfer of S1pr3−/− DC with or without FTY720 significantly protect kidney from IRI. These
studies suggest only S1pr1 are necessary for FTY720 dependent regulatory DC phenotype. Next, we tested if the route of delivery was important for FTY-DC induced
protection from kidney IRI. (B) Protocol for experimental setup. Plasma creatinine was measured 24 h after IRI. FTY-DC were injected either intravenous (i.v.),
intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.) or as i.v. using Veh-DC that were acutely treated with FTY720 (overnight along with LPS). These studies suggest that FTY-DC

Interestingly, the protection by FTY-DCs is lost if BMDCs are
administered either through intraperitoneal or subcutaneous
injections and if DCs are only treated acutely (overnight)
with FTY720 (Figure 5B). Therapeutic use of FTY-DCs is
maintained even if given 4 h after kidney ischemia (Figure 5C)
or if tested in allogeneic transfer experiments (C57BL/6J
DCs to BALB/c) in mice (Figure 5D). In allogeneic transfer
studies the BMDCs were not activated with LPS prior
to transfer and equally protect mice kidneys from IRI.
This could be due to involvement of adaptive immunity
with FTY-DC.
Mitochondria Function Is Critical in
FTY-DC Dependent Protection
Next, we tested if transferred FTY-DC (1) actively participate in
transferring mitochondria to recipient splenic cells through actin
polymerization, (2) required intact functional mitochondria, or
3) if active production of mitochondria (ATP) was involved in
FTY-DC dependent protection from injury. LPS treated FTY￾DC were treated with Rotenone (inhibitor of mitochondrial
electron transport) and Antimycin A (inhibitor of cellular
respiration) (Rot/AA; 2 µM/1µM). As control LPS treated
Veh-DC and FTY-DC were treated with equivalent volumes of
DMSO. Treating FTY-DC with Rot/AA to reduce mitochondrial
functions abrogated the protection from kidney IRI (Figure 6A).
Similarly, treating FTY-DC with either Cytochalasin D (CytoD;
15µM, an inhibitor of actin polymerization) or carbenoxolone
(CBX; C4790; Sigma-Aldrich; 100µM, non-specific inhibitor of
gap junctions) abrogated the protection compared to FTY-DC
treated group (Figure 6B). CD11cCrePhamfl/fl BMDCs were used
to check if FTY-DC treated with either Rot/AA, CytoD, or CBX
had differences in homing in vivo after injection. There were
no statistically significant changes in number of cells found in
the recipient spleen with either of the three inhibitors (data not
shown). Additionally, no changes in cell viability (Annexin V and
7-AAD) were observed in FTY-DC treated with either Rot/AA,
CytoD or CBX (data not shown). The structural changes in FTY￾DC were also analyzed after CytoD and CBX treatment after 24 h.
Compared to Veh treated FTY-DC (Figure 6C, CytoD treated
cells have changes in actin (Figure 6C,) and no changes were
observed in actin with CBX treatment (Figure 6C, right panel).
To test if the FTY-DC-dependent transfer of mitochondria
induced a change in cellular responses in spleen we harvested
spleen from mice that were treated with either NC (1x PBS), Veh￾DC, FTY-DC, FTY-DC (Rot/AA), or FTY-DC (CytoD) 24 h after
injection. Total splenic single cell suspensions (∼500,000/well)
were treated with LPS (25 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml) for either 6 or
24 h from the 5 groups. Splenocytes from FTY-DC (green) treated
mice had significantly lower levels of TNF-α at 6 h compared
to NC (black) or Veh-DC (red) treated mice (Figures 6D,E).
Splenocytes cultures from mice treated with FTY-DC (Rot/AA)
(blue) or FTY-DC (CytoD) (yellow) had higher levels of TNF￾α compared to FTY-DC treated mice. Possibly due to less
mitochondria transfers from [(Rot/AA) or (CytoD)] treated
FTY-DC to splenocytes. We noted that splenocytes that were
isolated from mice treated with Veh-DCs had significantly less
production of TNFα with 100 ng/ml LPS, suggesting that Veh￾DCs also donate mitochondria to splenocytes (as also shown
in Figure 3) although to lesser extent compared to FTY-DCs.
To test the hypothesis that increasing mitochondria numbers
as expected with FTY-DCs are responsible for inhibitory effect
on TNFα production from LPS treated splenocytes, we treated
mice with different doses of healthy isolated mitochondria. To
test if dose dependent uptake of mitochondria was responsible
for inducing an anti-inflammatory phenotype in splenocytes,
we injected mice with various amounts of isolated labeled
mitochondria and found that injected mitochondria signal was
mainly found in splenic macrophages as early as 30 min after
injection (data not shown). In order to check if injected
mitochondria are found in recipient mouse spleen, we either
used CD11cCrePhamfl/fl BMDCs or human HEK293 cells to
isolate mitochondria in separate experiments. Mice injected with
mitochondria isolated from CD11cCrePhamfl/fl BMDCs were
imaged after 24 h after injection (i.v.). As shown in Figure 3, in
these mice, systemically injected labeled mitochondria in spleen
was predominantly found in F4/80+ and CD169+ macrophages
(data not shown). However, unlike data shown in Figure 3,
signal associated with systemically injected mitochondria was
also found in various other tissues including kidneys (data
not shown). Using 50 µg mitochondria isolated from human
HEK293 cells we were able to check with RTPCR the expression
using human and mouse mtDNA primers in various tissues
over time. In spleen relative levels of h-mtDNA/m-mtDNA
expression increased as early as 30 min after injected and was
higher at 24 h after injection compared to uninfected mice
(data not shown). Mice were intravenously injected with various
amounts (0–100 µg/mouse) of isolated mitochondria isolated
from mouse liver. Splenocytes from mitochondria treated mice
were cultured 24 h after injection and stimulated with LPS
for 6 h. Total splenic single cell suspensions (∼100,000/well)
were treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 6 h. Mice treated with
mitochondria have a significant dose dependent decrease in
TNFα production compared to control (0 µg mitochondria)
treated mice (Figure 6F). Additionally, treatment of control
splenocytes (0 µg mitochondria) with isolated mitochondria
ex vivo (0–15 µg/well) 1 day before treatment with LPS also
significantly reduced TNFα in 6 h cultures in a dose dependent
manner (Figure 6G).

cells with FTY-DC (green mitochondria) have significantly

(Figure 7D).
Uptake of Healthy Mitochondria by
Macrophages Induce a Less Immunogenic
Phenotype
To determine if uptake of healthy mitochondria by RAW264.7
cells changes their responses to LPS, we repeated the above study
with isolated mitochondria rather than DC-dependent donation.
BMDCs were again propagated from CD11cCrePhamfl/fl mice
and mitochondria was isolated from 8 day old Veh-DCs.
RAW264.7 cells were treated with 10 µg/well of isolated
mitochondria for 24 h. Some of the treated RAW264.7 cells
were used for seahorse analysis and rest were treated with
100 ng/ml LPS for additional 24 h for gene analysis. As
control, equal amounts of sonicated (Son) mitochondria (Son￾Mito) were added in separate wells for 24 h. Treatment of
RAW264.7 cells with healthy mitochondria significantly induced
an increase in basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and
ATP production compared to vehicle treated cells and use of
Son-Mito abrogated these effects (Figures 8A–C). Mitochondria
treated RAW264.7 cells were also analyzed for uptake of labeled
mitochondria 24 h after incubation, the added mitochondria
signal appears perinuclear in location (white arrows, Figure 8D).
We next tested if addition of mitochondria regulated gene
expression in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS. Compared to
untreated RAW264.7 cells (Veh/LPS), cells treated with healthy
mitochondria had lower mRNA expression levels for Nos2,
Tnfa, Il1b, and Il16 after LPS stimulation (Mito/LPS). However,
treatment of RAW264.7 cells with Son-Mito abrogated these
inhibitory changes compared to healthy functional mitochondria
(Figures 8E–H) treated cells. Data was calculated as relative
fold changes compared to Veh/LPS treated cells (dash line,
Figures 8E–H).
DISCUSSION
In the current study we demonstrated that immunosuppression
and protection from kidney IRI induced by adoptive transfer
of FTY-DC is dependent on the recipient spleen, DC-S1P1
and functional viability of transferred DC mitochondria.
Furthermore, the protective effects of FTY-DC involve donation
of mitochondria to splenic macrophages making them less
immunogenic. In addition, our study for the first time to our
knowledge demonstrates that BMDCs like mesenchymal stem
cells (63) have the potential to donate mitochondria to induce an
immunosuppressive phenotype in recipient cells.

advances in its prevention or treatment (64). Additionally,

autoimmune disease, and transplantation has been under
investigation for the past 2 decades (65). However, most studies
have focused on the induction of T cell–tolerogenic responses.
Immune regulation of innate immune response via tolerogenic
DCs is critically important in bridging innate and adaptive
immunity and provides the foundation for use in transplant
tolerance of allograft injury (66). Cell-based therapy using
regulatory immune cells [Tregs (67), myeloid cells (68), or
DCs (69, 70)] is a strategy that induces potential antigen￾specific tolerance. Pharmacological or biological strategies induce
regulatory or tolerogenic DCs (Tol-DC) (71), which are
immature, maturation-resistant or alternatively activated cells
that express low levels of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules.
Compared with mature DCs, immature DCs interact actively
with T cells and direct them into a regulatory response. Depletion
of DCs significantly protects mouse kidneys from IRI (6, 13)
and a dose-dependent increase in BMDC numbers exacerbates
kidney injury (13), suggesting that DCs play a major role
in inducing AKI. As our current and previously published
studies demonstrate injected BMDCs accumulate in the spleen
(Figure 3) after systemic infusion (72) and can persist for
two weeks post-injection (73). In kidney IRI, DCs tolerized
with an A2AR agonist (74) or DCs deficient of S1pr3 (13)
attenuated AKI. Our current study further demonstrates using
CD11cCrePhamfl/fl mice to harvest DCs that transferred DCs can
donate their mitochondria to recipient cells thus making them
less immunogenic.
Role of S1P Receptor Agonist (FTY720) in
Kidney Injury and Dendritic Cells
S1P1 activation is important for maintaining cell viability;
global deletion is embryonically lethal (75). We have previously
demonstrated that the protective effect of S1P1 agonists FTY720
or SEW2871 in IRI (54) and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity
(14, 49) was mediated by activation of S1P1 expressed on PT cells,
independent of lymphopenia (14). Others have also shown that
FTY720 can act as innate immune system immunomodulator
that involves a role beyond its prominent effects on lymphocyte
recirculation (76). In another study, using a mixed lymphocyte
reaction (MLR), FTY720-treated human DCs exhibited reduced
antigen presentation and altered cytokine production (77) and
systemic injection with FTY720 was also found to block DC
trafficking (78). Our current data (Supplemental Figure 1) and
others have previously demonstrated that FTY720 alone does
not affect the surface of BMDCs surface markers CD11c,
MHCII, CD40, CD86, and indicates there is no change in
viability. However, BMDCs propagated in presence of FTY720
do have immunosuppressive phenotype upon stimulation (LPS,
CD40L or mixed lymphocyte reactions) and transfer of these
immunosuppressive BMDCs confirms protection in various
models CD80 (56, 77, 79, 80). In many of these studies the
protective effects of FTY720 treated BMDCs was due to infusion
of these immunosuppressive cells to block T cell responses. FTY￾DCs in our study are immature compared to Veh-DCs after LPS
stimulation and transfer of these FTY-DCs could potentially have
regulatory responses on adaptive immunity. In our experiments
we did observed a higher number of Tregs in spleen of FTY￾DC treated mice but the exact mechanism of this is yet to
be determined.
Role of Mitochondria in Dendritic Cells and
Macrophages
DC and macrophage functions are regulated by mitochondrial
metabolism. Type 1 macrophages (81, 82) and immunogenic
DCs have high glycolytic rates (62). The activation of DCs or
macrophages by several TLR agonist (LPS or CpG) leads to
rapid increase in glycolysis followed by decrease in OXPHOS
and mitochondrial membrane potential (62, 83, 84). Some role
for mitochondria has been demonstrated with DCs treated
in vitro with vitamin D, these DCs have increased OXPHOS,
mitochondrial mass and mROS production (85), similar to what
we observe with FTY-DCs. Although the mechanistic details
of how glycolysis and mitochondria metabolism controls DC
function are unknown our data suggests FTY-DC continue to
rely of mitochondria OXPHOS and this could contribute to
their less immunogenic phenotype. Multiple mechanisms may
exist by how FTY-DC protect kidneys from IRI, one possible
mechanism is through mitochondria donation. Our current
data indicates that transferred FTY-DCs are more efficient
at transferring mitochondria to recipient splenocytes, mainly
macrophages (CD169+ or F4/80+). The exact mechanism of
how mitochondria get transferred to macrophages is unknown,
however use of either actin polymerization inhibitor Cyto D
or non-specific gap junction inhibitor CBX abrogated FTY-DC
dependent protection. Treatment with Cyto D or CBX did not
change the viability or trafficking of FTY-DC in vivo (data not
shown). in vivo transferred Veh-DC also donate mitochondria
to splenocytes however to a lesser extent compared to FTY-DC.
This was clear as stimulation of splenocytes isolated from mice
24 h after various DC infusion [Veh-DC, FTY-DC, FTY-DC
(Rot/AA), or FTY-DC (CytoD)] had less TNF-α levels after ex
vivo stimulation with LPS compared to NC splenocytes. TNFα
was significantly lower in Veh-DC treated splenocytes compared
to NC splenocytes at 6 h after LPS stimulation. Splenocytes that
were from FTY-DC treated mice displayed most suppression
in TNFα production, an effect that was partially lost if FTY￾DC were pretreated with Rot/AA or Cyto D demonstrating
a dependence upon mitochondrial function. These data
indicate that uptake of naked/free mitochondria or DC-derived
mitochondria in a dose dependent manner induces an anti￾inflammatory phenotype, although the exact mechanism is
currently unknown.
Our current findings indicate that DCs have the potential
to donate mitochondria to induce immunological changes in
the recipient cells a protective mechanism previously shown
to be employed by mesenchymal stem (86) and bone-marrow￾derived stromal cells (87). As demonstrated in our earlier studies
(12), the injected bone-marrow-derived DCs are predominantly
found in the recipient spleen as early as 30 min and signal
persist up to 72 h. More importantly using transgenic mice
(that contain labeled Pham mitochondria) to propagate DCs
(CD11cCrePhamfl/fl
) our study is the first to demonstrate

Rousselle et al. Transfer of FTY-DC Prevents Kidney IRI
in addition to homing to the spleen, injected DCs donate
mitochondria to splenic macrophages. Compared to naïve DC,
DCs propagated in presence of FTY720 (FTY-DC) are more
efficient at donating mitochondria to recipient splenocytes
mainly to macrophages. The exact mechanism of how FTY￾DC donate mitochondria is currently unknown but does
involve gap junctions and actin polymerization as treatment
with inhibitors (Cyto D or CBX) abrogates the protection
by FTY-DCs. Our current study analyzed the involvement of
macrophage dependent innate adaptive immunity in FTY-DCs
dependent protection. However, we did note that in spleen
of FTY-DC treated mice there was an increase in labeling
of white pulp CD4+FoxP3+ cells that was in addition to
disrupted CD169+ labeling of the MZ, similar to as previously
demonstrated using S1pr3−/− DCs (12). Thus, in addition to
donating mitochondria to splenic macrophages FTY-DCs could
also regulate adaptive immune responses resulting in higher
Treg cells.
Limitation of our current study using mouse kidney IRI
model is that this model is acute (<2 days), thus it is
possible that if mice are followed for longer time periods
after infusion of FTY-DCs especially in allogenic transfers
(C57BL/6J BMDCs→ BALB/c mice or inverse), we might have
a significant change in adaptive immune responses including
higher Treg numbers. Since FTY-DCs are immunogenically
immature (low CD80, CD86, MHCII, and higher IL10) after
LPS stimulation and injection of these FTY-DCs increases
splenic Tregs, we are in process of testing if FTY-DCs can
be used to delay rejection using allogenic mouse model of
heterotopic heart transplant. Lastly, if higher mitochondria
numbers in FTY-DCs indeed induce the protection we observed,
it would be interesting to test if artificially increasing DC
mitochondria numbers (mitochondria transplant) also have
similar therapeutic advantage. This is especially important since
as current study demonstrates, we must propagate DCs in
presence of FTY720 from start of BMDC cultures, as acute
(overnight) treatment of DCs with FTY720 does not protect
kidneys from IRI.
In summary we have demonstrated that BMDCs can regulate
innate immune response by donating mitochondria. The anti￾inflammatory responses induced by FTY-DC are dependent on
the spleen and presence of S1P1 receptors. In the spleen, FTY￾DC donate mitochondria more efficiently compared to Veh-DC
to splenic macrophages (F4/80+ and CD169+). Dose dependent
uptake of mitochondria by splenic and RAW264.7 macrophages
induces metabolic reprogramming that is a key driver of anti￾inflammatory phenotype. We conclude that regulatory FTY-DC
may be useful in kidney IRI as well as in other inflammatory states
such as transplantation and autoimmune disorders.
