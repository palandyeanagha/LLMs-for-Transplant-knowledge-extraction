Abstract
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis,
and hepatocellular carcinoma. The gut-derived endotoxin plays an essential role in the pathophysiological development
and progression of NAFLD. By using rat models of choline-deficient/L-amino acid-defined (CDAA)-diet-induced NAFLD, we
examined whether MIYAIRI 588–a butyrate-producing probiotic – prevents the progression of pathophysiological changes
from steatosis to hepatocarcinogenesis. In vivo experiments showed that treatment with MIYAIRI 588 reduced CDAA-diet￾induced hepatic lipid deposition and significantly improved the triglyceride content, insulin resistance, serum endotoxin
levels, and hepatic inflammatory indexes. We also found that MIYAIRI 588 substantially increased the activation of hepatic
adenosine 59-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AKT and the expression of lipogenesis- or lipolysis￾related proteins. MIYAIRI 588 also improved CDAA-diet-induced delocalization and substantially decreased the expression of
the tight-junction proteins intestinal zonula occluden-1 and occludin in CDAA-diet-fed rats. Further, the MIYAIRI 588-treated
rats also showed remarkable induction of nuclear factor erythoid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its targeted antioxidative
enzymes, which suppressed hepatic oxidative stress. In vitro studies revealed that treatment with sodium butyrate (NaB)
also activated AMPK and AKT and enhanced Nrf2 expression by precluding ubiquitination, thereby increasing the half-life of
the Nrf2 protein. Pharmacological studies and siRNA knockdown experiments showed that NaB-mediated AMPK activation
induced the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Sirtuin 1, leading to the increased assembly of mammalian TOR
complex 2 and phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 and subsequent induction of Nrf2 expression and activation. These
favorable changes caused an obvious decrease in hepatic fibrous deposition, GST-P-positive foci development, and
hepatocarcinogenesis. Our data clearly established that the probiotic MIYAIRI 588 has beneficial effects in the prevention of
NAFLD progression.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common
liver disease in Japan and United States and a significant public
health concern worldwide. NAFLD includes simple steatosis,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1]. Although NAFLD is benign,
recent studies indicate that around 40% of NAFLD patients
progress to fibrosis and .50% develop NASH after 4–13 years
[2,3]. The complexity and chronology of pathophysiological
events leading to NAFLD and NASH; reasons for occasional
progression toward chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis;
and effective therapies for NASH remain unknown. Therefore,
effective interventions should be developed for NAFLD patients
likely to develop NASH and HCC.
Some mechanisms mediating the pathogenesis of NASH have
been discovered. NAFLD progression is known to depend on
genetic and environmental cofactors [4,5]. The latter include
bacterial translocation through the intestinal wall and intestinal
bacterial overgrowth. Gut microbiota generate products such as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell-wall component of gram-negative
bacteria, which are delivered to the liver via the portal vein [4,6].
Endotoxin production by gut microbiota can cause inflammation
in patients with obesity, diabetes, metabolic disorder, NAFLD, and
NASH [4,5]. In murine models of NAFLD, bacterial overgrowth
causes compositional changes and increased intestinal permeabil￾ity by reducing the expression of tight-junction (TJ) proteins [7].
Consistently, circulating endotoxin levels are elevated in most
animal models of diet-induced NAFLD and NASH [8]. Addition￾ally, plasma endotoxin levels are significantly higher in patients

with NAFLD of different histological severities and associated with
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal
permeability [9]. Furthermore, a complex mechanism involving
extensive lipid accumulation, systemic inflammation, oxidative
stress, and insulin resistance causes cytotoxicity and exacerbated
hepatopathy [1,5,10]. Since obesity, NAFLD, and NASH are
associated with a shift of the gut microbiota profile, treatment with
probiotics to modify the intestinal flora may prevent NAFLD
progression.
Clostridium butyricum is a butyric acid-producing gram-positive
anaerobe found in the soil and in the intestines of healthy animals
and humans [11]. The MIYAIRI 588 strain of C. butyricum is used
as a probiotic for treating and preventing non-antimicrobial￾induced diarrhea, antimicrobial-associated diarrhea, and consti￾pation in humans [12,13]. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid
(SCFA) produced by microbiota in the colon and distal small
intestine from resistant starch, dietary fiber, and low-digestible
polysaccharides by fermentation [14]. Clinical trials show that
luminal instillation of butyrate is a promising therapy for ulcerative
colitis and related inflammatory disorders [15,16].
Dietary supplementation of butyrate induces the activation of
adenosine 59-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
thereby preventing and treating high-fat-diet-induced obesity and
insulin resistance in mice [17]. AMPK regulates energy homeo￾stasis via its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism [18], controls
fatty acid oxidation by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, and
suppresses the lipogenic gene expression by reducing the activity of
the transcriptional factors sterol-regulatory element-binding pro￾tein 1c (SREBP-1c) [19]. Hepatic AMPK also decreases hepatic
lipogenesis, and AMPK activity can inhibit reactive oxidative
stress (ROS) and inflammation [20]. In vitro experiments have
shown that NaB treatment increased AMPK activity and
accelerated the assembly of TJ proteins in the colonic epithelial
cell line Caco-2 [21].
We hypothesized that MIYAIRI 588 may prevent NAFLD
progression by improving the environment of gut microbiota and
activating hepatic energy metabolism. Therefore, we investigated
the effects of MIYAIRI588 on NAFLD progression in animals fed
on choline-deficient/L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet.
Materials and Methods
Reagents
Materials were obtained from the following sources: sodium
butyrate (NaB), human recombinant insulin, and D-glucose were
purchased from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan); 5-
aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide, 1-D-ribonucleoside (AICAR),
compound C, LY294002, and MG132, from Calbiochem-Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany); and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), cycloheximide (CHX), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and
a proteinase inhibitor cocktail, from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Animals and Experimental Protocol
All animals used in the present study received humane care, and
the experiment protocols were approved by the Animal Experi￾ment Committee of Tokai University (Permit Number 114007).
Male Fischer 344 rats weighing 70 g were purchased from CLEA
Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). After acclimatization for 1 week on a
standard diet, the rats were divided into 3 groups. Group 1
received a CDAA diet to establish animal models for diet-induced
liver steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocar￾cinogenesis. Group 2 received CDAA diet containing MIYAIRI
588, a pharmaceutical product of C. butyricum, (8.5 6 109 cfu/g,
Miyarisan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) after feeding
on the CDAA diet for 2 weeks. In a preliminary experiment and
the current study, we ensured that the feeding of the CDAA diet
caused liver steatosis for 2 weeks (Figure S1). Therefore, 10% of
the total amount of CDAA diet was replaced with excipients
containing MIYAIRI 588 at 2 weeks after the commencement of
this experiment. Group 3 received a corresponding control
choline-sufficient/L-amino acid-defined (CSAA) diet. The CSAA
and CDAA diets were obtained in powdered form from Dyets Inc.
(Bethlehem, PA, USA). In the both CSAA and CDAA group, 10%
of the total amount of the diet was replaced with the same amount
of excipients (placebo) only. A subgroup of each group was killed
at 8, 16, and 50 weeks after the diet regimens were completed, and
subjected to morphologic, biochemical, and molecular biologic
analyses (Figure S1). For the all analyses, at least 6 rats per group
were used in this experiment.
Histologic Examination
Conventional histologic examination was performed by hema￾toxylin and eosin, Azan-Mallory, Sirius-red, and Oil-red O
staining of excised liver sections, as described previously
[22,23,24,25].
Immunohistochemistry
For immunostainings of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), 4-
hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), and glutathione S-transferase pla￾cental form (GST-P), 5-mm-thick tissue sections were stained by
the indirect immunoperoxidase method with anti-a-SMA (Sigma),
anti-4-HNE (JaiCA, Shizuoka, Japan), and anti-GST-P (MBL,
Nagoya, Japan) antibodies as described previously [26,27].
For the immunofluorescence examination, liver tissues were
embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan) and snap￾frozen in liquid nitrogen, by using a previously described method
with minor modifications [22]. To detect the expression levels in
liver tissue, antibodies against Nrf2, GST-P, a-SMA, and desmin
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA) were used together with the appropriate
secondary antibodies conjugated with Qdot 605, Qdot 655, or
AlexaFluor488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were
stained with TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent signals
were observed and analyzed using the confocal laser-scanning
microscope LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Detection of Intracellular ROS Generation
For the detection of hepatic superoxide production, an oxidative
fluorescent dye dihydroethidium (DHE) was used to evaluate the in
situ production of superoxides [28,29]. Unfixed fresh liver tissue
samples were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, Tokyo,
Japan) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Then, 10-mm-thick
sections were incubated at 37uC for 30 min with 10 mM DHE
(Molecular Probes). Fluorescent signals were obtained using a
confocal laser-scanning microscope.
Figure 1. MIYAIRI 588 prevents progression of CDAA diet-induced liver steatosis to tumorigenesis. Each group was investigated at 8,
16, and 50 weeks after completion of the diet regimen. MIYAIRI 588 was administered after CDAA diet feeding for 2 weeks. To confirm that the
feeding of the CDAA diet caused the liver steatosis, the groups administered CSAA and CDAA were examined at 2 weeks after the commencement of
this experiment. (A) Macroscopic histomorphology and (B) hematoxylin and eosin staining for microscopic histopathology were performed at the
indicated time periods. Data are representative of 6 individual liver sections. Original magnification, 625.

Biochemical Analyses
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was measured with
the ALT colarendopoint assay kit (Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX).
Total triacylglycerol content (TG) in liver tissue was determined by
the colorimetric method using the triglyceride quantification kit
(BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Hepatic tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) level was measured by ELISA using the Quantikine Rat
ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The degree of
lipid peroxidation in the liver was assessed by measurement of the
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels using the TBARS Assay Kit
(Cayman Chemical, MI, USA).
Assessment of Insulin Resistance
Serum insulin level was measured by rat insulin ELISA kit
(Sibayagi, Gunma, Japan). Peripheral blood glucose concentration
was determined using an automated glycemia reader (Glutest
sensor and Glutest Every; Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho, Nagoya,
Japan). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) was calculated using the following formula: [immu￾noreactive insulin (mU/mL) 6fasting blood sugar (mg/dL) 4 405]
[30].
Endotoxin Assay
Blood samples were collected from the portal vein. Endotoxin
plasma levels were determined using the commercially available
Pyrochrome LAL kit (Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell Culture and Treatment
Cells of the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (Japanese Cancer
Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan) were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/mL penicillin,
50 mg/mL streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids (Gibco
BRL, Paisley, UK). To establish an in vitro model of insulin
resistance, HepG2 cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM
containing either normal concentrations of glucose (5.5 mM D￾glucose) or high concentrations of glucose (30 mM D-glucose) for
24 h, as described elsewhere [31,32]. Cells were treated with
100 nM insulin for 20 min prior to harvest.
RNA Interference and Transfection
Gene expression was silenced using the FlexiTube GeneSolu￾tion small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting PRKAA1
(AMPKa1), SIRT1, RICTOR, and AKT1 (Qiagen Valencia, CA).
AllStars negative-control siRNAs was used as the negative control
(Qiagen). Transfection of cells with 50 nM siRNA was performed
using a Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Protein Isolation and Western Blotting
Preparation of total, cytosol, or nucleus protein extracts from
cells and tissues; electrophoresis; and subsequent blotting were
performed as described previously [22,33]. Membranes were
probed with the antibodies against a-SMA, a-tubulin, b-actin
(Sigma), Nrf2, PPAR-a, PPAR-c, SREBP-1c, Lamin B (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), AKT, phospho-AKT
(Ser473), phospho-AKT (Thr308), AMPK-a, phospho-AMPK
(Thr172), mTOR, rictor, raptor, ubiquitin, p65 NF-kB (Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA), collagen I, UCP-2, TRX (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), Keap1, NQO1, SIRT1 (Proteintech group,
Chicago, IL), ZO-1, Occludin (Zymed Laboratories, San Fran￾cisco, CA), BSEP (Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, WA), HO-1 (Enzo
Life Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA), histone H3 (Millipore,
Bedford, MA), and GST-P (MBL). For the detection of human
Nrf2, SIRT1, and phosphorylated SIRT1 (Ser47), specific
antibodies anti-Nrf2 (Abcam), anti-SIRT1 (Millipore), and phos￾pho-SIRT1 (Cell Signaling), respectively, were used. Collagen I
was detected using the non-denaturing protocol.
Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation was performed using the Pierce Crosslink
Immunoprecipitation Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For immunoprecip￾itation of endogenous mTORC1 and mTORC2, complexes from
total cell lysates were prepared in CHAPS-containing lysis buffer
(40 mM HEPES of pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
10 mM 2-glycerophosphate, 0.3% CHAPS, and proteinase
inhibitor cocktail [Sigma]) were carried out as described previously
[34,35,36]. For the detection of Nrf2 and ubiquitin complexes,
cells were lysed and washed by RIPA buffer (Sigma). Immuno￾precipitated proteins were then denatured and separated from the
sepharose beads by adding SDS-sample buffer and boiling for
5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by western blotting.
CHX Chase Experiment
Post-transcriptional regulation of both the steady-state levels
and half-life of Nrf2 protein was investigated by CHX chase
analysis as described previously [33].
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as the mean 6 SD. Analysis of variance
was used to compare the differences between the groups.
Differences were analyzed by Student’s t test. A P value of
,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
MIYAIRI 588 Treatment Prevents NAFLD Progression
Histologically, the livers of rats fed the CDAA diet for 2, 8, 16,
and 50 weeks showed severe steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and
tumorigenesis, respectively, implying that CDAA diet feeding
induced NAFLD, NASH, liver cirrhosis, and eventually, tumor
development (Figure 1). The CSAA-diet-fed control rats showed
no macroscopic or histologic changes, while the coadministration
of MIYAIRI 588 and CDAA diet caused remarkable amelioration
of hepatic gross appearance. These results suggested that
treatment with MIYAIRI 588 delays the CDAA-induced NAFLD
Figure 2. MIYAIRI 588 reduced hepatic lipid deposition and insulin resistance. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 6 per group) were fed a control
(choline-sufficient/L-amino acid-defined CSAA) diet, choline-deficient/L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet, or CDAA diet plus MIYAIRI 588 for 8 weeks.

progression and ultimately liver tumorigenesis. Significant differ￾ences between the body weights of the rats in the CDAA-diet and
MIYAIRI 588-fed groups were observed at 4 and 8 weeks (Figure
S2A); however, the liver-to-body weight showed no significant
intergroup difference (Figure S2B).
Reduction of Liver Steatosis and Insulin Resistance by
MIYAIRI 588
We further investigated the effects of MIYAIRI 588 on hepatic
lipid deposition by oil red O staining. Hepatic lipid accumulation
and total triacylglycerol (TG) content were suppressed in the
MIYAIRI 588-treated rats (Figure 2A and B). To investigate
whether AMPK might be responsible for the protective effects of
MIYAIRI 588, hepatic AMPK activity was assessed by determin￾ing the phosphorylation state of AMPK (Figure 2C). Hepatic
AMPK phosphorylation was decreased in CDAA-diet-fed rats and
was remarkably improved by MIYAIRI 588. Expression of hepatic
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-a–a well-char￾acterized target of AMPK–was also observed in MIYAIRI 588-
treated rats. However, the expression of sterol regulatory element
binding protein (SREBP)-1c, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and
PPAR-c, which are involved in hepatic lipogenesis in high-fat-diet￾induced or genetically controlled obesity, was induced in CDAA￾diet-fed rat livers and suppressed by MIYAIRI 588. No significant
change in the total AMPK level was evident. The fasting glucose
levels were similar in the 3 groups (Figure 2D). The fasting plasma
insulin levels and the calculated HOMA-IR were dramatically
reduced by MIYAIRI 588 (Figure 2E and F). Further, distur￾bances in hepatic AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in CDAA-diet￾fed rats under feeding conditions were considerably reduced in
MIYAIRI 588-treated rats, while AKT phosphorylation at
Thr308 and the total AKT level remained unchanged (Figure 2G).
MIYAIRI 588 Suppresses Endotoxin Levels and Improves
Gut Permeability
The gut-derived endogenous endotoxin plays a critical role in
the development and progression of insulin resistance, NAFLD,
and NASH [5]. Serum endotoxin levels in the portal vein were
higher in the CDAA-diet-fed rats than the CSAA-fed rats, but
lower in the MIYAIRI 588-fed rats than the former at 8 and 16
weeks (Figure 3A). Gut permeability is controlled by TJ proteins,
including zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Immunohisto￾chemical and western blot analyses showed that the strong
expression and intact network of ZO-1 were predominant at
crypts in intestinal sections of CSAA-fed control rats (Figure 3B
and C). Importantly, the delocalization and substantial decrease in
ZO-1 expression in the intestinal sections of CDAA-diet-fed rats
were dramatically improved by MIYAIRI 588. Similar results
were obtained on staining for occludin expression in the intestinal
sections (Figure 3C and Figure S3). Thus, CDAA-diet-induced
increase in hepatic NF-kB expression, plasma ALT levels, and
hepatic tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) production were signif￾icantly suppressed by MIYAIRI 588 treatment by decreasing
endotoxin levels and enhancing TJ protein expression (Figure 3D,
E, and F).
Suppression of Hepatic Oxidative Stress and Induction of
Nrf2 by MIYAIRI 588 Treatment
Oxidative stress and the release of ROS probably contribute to
the development of NASH, which is further complicated by the
elevation of intestinal endotoxin that induces ROS production in
the liver [5]. Therefore, we first measured the hepatic levels of the
lipid peroxidation products 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and
malondialdehyde (MDA), as indicators of oxidative stress, after 8
weeks of the diet. Immunohistochemical staining showed lower
hepatic 4-HNE levels in the MIYAIRI 588-treated rats than in the
CDAA-diet-fed rats (Figure 4A). Measurement of MDA using
thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay also showed that
hepatic lipid peroxidation levels were lower in MIYAIRI 588-fed
rats than CDAA-diet-fed rats (Figure 4B). Furthermore, DHE
staining revealed that hepatic superoxide generation was much
higher in the CDAA-diet-fed rats than the CSAA-fed rats, whereas
hepatic DHE-positive signals were markedly decreased in the
MIYAIRI 588-treated rats (Figure 4C).
Nrf2 is a potent transcriptional activator and is important for
inducing of the expression of many cytoprotective genes triggered
in response to oxidative stresses [37]. Immunostaining analysis
showed that induction of hepatic Nrf2 expression at 8 weeks and
expression of the Nrf2-regulated proteins heme oxygenase-1 (HO￾1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) were greater
in the MIYAIRI 588-treated rats than CDAA-diet-fed rats
(Figure 4D and E). Nrf2 expression was most predominant at 16
weeks (Figure S4). Levels of bile salt export pump (BSEP), a major
determinant of bile-salt-dependent bile secretion that is induced by
oltipraz–an Nrf2 activator [38]–were similar in the CDAA-diet-fed
and MIYAIRI 588-treated rats (Figure 4E).
NaB induces Nrf2 expression by stabilization of Nrf2
protein. MIYAIRI 588 induced Nrf2 expression both in the
liver and intestinal tissues (Figure 4D, E, and Figure S4, S5). We
further examined whether NaB directly induces Nrf2 expression,
by treating HepG2 cells with NaB for different durations and
doses. The increased expression of Nrf2 was just detectable at 1–
2.5 mM NaB, and time-dependent induction of the Nrf2-targeted
enzymes HO-1, NQO1, and thioredoxin (TRX) was also observed
(Figure 5A and B). Nrf2 activation is mainly regulated by its
inhibitory anchor protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1
(Keap1). NaB caused the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in a time￾dependent manner, without any change in Keap1 expression
levels (Figure 5C). To investigate the detailed mechanisms
underlying the induction of Nrf2 expression by NaB, we examined
the ubiquitination of endogenous Nrf2 by immunoprecipitation
experiments after treatment with the MG132–a 26 S proteasome
Figure 3. MIYAIRI 588 improves endotoxin levels in the portal vein and restores tight-junction protein expression. Rats were fed a
control (CSAA) diet, CDAA diet, or CDAA diet plus MIYAIRI 588 for 8 or 16 weeks. MIYAIRI 588 was administered after 2 weeks of CDAA diet feeding.

inhibitor–in the presence or absence of NaB. Treatment with NaB
or the Nrf2-inducer tBHQ reduced the ubiquitination of
endogenous Nrf2 (Figure 5D), thereby increasing the half-life of
Nrf2 from approximately 34 min to 114 min after NaB treatment
(Figure 5E).
NaB-induced Nrf2 Expression is Regulated by AMPK and
AKT Activation, Sirtuin 1 Expression, and mTORC2
Modification
Next, we analyzed the correlation between activation of AMPK
and AKT and expression of Nrf2 in NaB-stimulated HepG2 cells.
The phosphorylation of AMPK and AKT resulted in the
induction of Nrf2 expression in the cells (Figure 6A), thereby
confirming our in vivo findings. Further, NaB-induced phosphor￾ylation of AKT and expression of Nrf2 were blocked by the
AMPK-selective antagonist compound C (Figure 6B). However,
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-specific inhibitor LY294002
did not inhibit NaB-induced AMPK phosphorylation but partially
suppressed AKT phosphorylation and Nrf2 expression. Keap1
expression remained unchanged. Similar results were obtained
when another AMPK-specific agonist, 5-amino 4-imidazolecar￾boxamide riboside (AICAR), was used. AMPK regulates Sirtuin 1
(SIRT1) activity in some tissues [39] and SIRT1 promotes the
expression of the mammalian TOR complex 2 (mTORC2)
component rictor in the liver [40]. mTORC2 specifically
phosphorylates AKT at Ser473 [41]. Our in vivo experiments
showed that hepatic SIRT1 expression was reduced in CDAA￾diet-fed rats and remarkably improved by MIYAIRI 588 under
feeding conditions. MIYAIRI 588-mediated SIRT1 induction was
detected more clearly after fasting (Figure S6). We also found that
NaB or AICAR treatment induced SIRT1 expression only
marginally, but SIRT1 phosphorylation clearly occurred at
Ser47 and was completely inhibited by compound C, but not by
LY294002 (Figure 6C). No significant change was detected in
rictor expression. Further, NaB-induced phosphorylation of
SIRT1 was abolished by AMPKa1 siRNA, while the expression
of rictor was not affected by AMPKa1 or SIRT1 siRNA
(Figure 6D). Next, we determined whether the formation of
mTORC2 components was affected by NaB. The coimmunopre￾cipitation assay results showed an increased assembly of endog￾enous rictor and mTOR, which was reduced by compound C or
LY294002 treatment (Figure 6E). In addition, the rictor and
mTOR association augmented by NaB or AICAR was completely
diminished by AMPKa1 or SIRT1 siRNA (Figure 6F). If the
expression of SIRT1 or rictor caused an alteration in the signal
transduction by NaB, we reasoned that intracellular distributions
of these proteins would be accompanied by dynamic alterations in
the cells. NaB or AICAR treatment were indeed found to cause a
dose-dependent nuclear accumulation of SIRT1 and rictor
(Figure 6G). This nuclear translocation of SIRT1 and rictor was
impeded by compound C. However, LY294002 did not inhibit the
nuclear accumulation of SIRT1, but not rictor (Figure 6H). We
also found that inhibition of AMPKa1 was associated with
diminished NaB-induced nuclear accumulation of SIRT1, rictor,
AKT, and Nrf2 in the cells. SIRT1 siRNA impaired NaB￾mediated translocation of rictor into the nucleus, AKT, and Nrf2.
Similarly, siRNA targeting rictor blocked the NaB-induced
nuclear transport of AKT and Nrf2 from the cytoplasm. A
siRNA-mediated knockdown of AKT1 impaired only the nuclear
accumulation of Nrf2 underlying NaB treatment without affecting
the expression of AMPK, SIRT1, and rictor (Figure 6I).
NaB Overcomes Signal Transduction Deteriorated by
Insulin Resistance
We created a model of insulin resistance by exposing HepG2
cells to high concentrations of glucose and examined the effect of
NaB under insulin-resistance conditions. Indeed, insulin-triggered
AKT phosphorylation was almost completely abolished under
these conditions (Figure 7A), while phosphorylation of AMPK and
SIRT1 and expression of Nrf2 and SIRT1 were reduced; these
reductions were markedly improved by NaB with or without
insulin. However, the expression levels of mTOR, rictor, and a
mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1) component, raptor,
remained unaltered. Since the binding of rictor to mTOR was
increased by NaB under normal conditions (Figure 6E), we
hypothesized that AKT activation would be recovered by NaB
treatment through the augmentation of mTORC2 assembly under
insulin-resistance conditions. Endogenous rictor–mTOR interac￾tion was enhanced, whereas the raptor–mTOR complex was
unaffected by stimulation with insulin and/or NaB, under normal
conditions (Figure 7B). Conversely, decreased rictor–mTOR and
increased raptor–mTOR interaction were noted under insulin￾resistance conditions. Treatment with insulin and/or NaB did not
alter the raptor–mTOR interaction under normal conditions.
While the formation of these complexes was augmented by insulin￾resistance condition, the raptor–mTOR interaction was largely
abolished by NaB treatment. Oil-red O staining showed that
increased lipid accumulation induced by high glucose was
significantly reduced by NaB treatment with insulin in HepG2
cells (Figure 7C).
MIYAIRI 588 Prevents CDAA-diet-induced Liver Fibrosis
and Hepatocarcinogenesis in Rat Liver
We examined the histologic changes in the fibrotic or cirrhotic
liver at 8 and 16 weeks. Azan-Mallory staining showed an obvious
decrease in fibrous deposition areas in MIYAIRI 588-treated rats
(Figure 8A), as confirmed by densitometric analysis. Similarly, the
hepatic protein levels of fibrosis-related factors, including a-SMA
and collagen I, and the hepatic collagen deposition were lower in
the MIYAIRI 588-fed rats than the CDAA-diet-fed rats
(Figures 8B and C and S7). Lastly, we first investigated the
hepatic expression levels of glutathione S-transferase placental
form (GST-P), a marker for cellular alteration in the early stage of
hepatocarcinogenesis, at 8 or 16 weeks. The area, number, and
expression levels of hepatic GST-P foci were lower in the
MIYAIRI 588-treated rats than in the CDAA-diet-fed rats

liver tumors was decreased. Although all the CDAA diet-fed rats
developed liver tumors at 50 weeks, the number of detectable
tumors ($1.0 mm) and maximal diameters of tumors were
significantly lower in the MIYAIRI 588-treated rats (Figure 9C
and D).
Discussion
This study revealed that treatment with the C. butyricum strain
MIYAIRI 588–a butyrate-producing probiotic–prevents the pro￾gression of CDAA-induced NAFLD to liver carcinogenesis in
animals. Furthermore, we found that NaB activates the AMPK/
SIRT1/PI3K/mTORC2/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Thus,
our results indicate an important and novel use of MIYAIRI 588
and explain the role of the gut–liver axis in nutrient-induced
NAFLD.
Gut bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Leptin￾deficient ob/ob and hyperleptinemic db/db mice have higher
endotoxin levels in the portal blood than wild-type animals [7].
Metnionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet and fructose intake
caused NAFLD in mice, resulting in increased gut-derived
endotoxin levels in portal blood [42,43,44]. Further, the leakage
of gut-microbiota-derived LPS into the portal blood is a well￾established mechanism of metabolic endotoxemia that triggers
systemic inflammation and hepatic oxidative stress [4,5,6]. Thus,
proper regulation of the intestinal environment is important to
prevent NAFLD progression. Although administration of the
probiotic preparation VSL#3, containing freeze-dried bacteria of
8 species, attenuates MCD-diet-induced liver fibrosis in mice, it
does not reduce liver steatosis, inflammation, or serum endotoxin
levels [43]. MIYAIRI 588 significantly suppressed the CDAA-diet￾induced increase in endotoxin levels in the portal vein and also
restored the ZO-1 and occludin levels to those in the control
group. This implied that MIYAIRI 588 efficiently reduced gut￾derived endotoxin levels in the portal blood by altering the
intestinal flora and restoring gut-barrier functions, thereby
reducing the hepatic levels of inflammatory cytokine TNF-a and
TNF-a-regulated transcription factor NF-kB. Peng et al. demon￾strated that butyrate enhances the intestinal barrier function by
facilitating the assembly and expression of ZO-1 and occludin,
depending on AMPK activation [21]. Furthermore, dietary
supplementation of NaB activated hepatic AMPK in mice fed
on a high-fat diet [17]. Interestingly, MIYAIRI 588 treatment
prevented the CDAA-diet-induced decrease in hepatic AMPK
phosphorylation. NaB also activated AMPK in HepG2 cells.
While butyrate is largely utilized by the colonic epithelium as an
energy source, a substantial amount of butyrate transfers from the
gut to the liver via the portal vein [45]. Thus, MIYAIRI 588-
produced butyrate may have direct beneficial effects on the gut
and liver by altering the gut environment and AMPK activation.
AMPK increases NAD+ levels, activates SIRT1, and induces
SIRT1-dependent PGC1a deacetylation [46,47]. SIRT1 is
activated through the phosphorylation at Ser27, Ser47, and
Thr530 by c-Jun n-terminal kinase activation in response to
oxidative stress and is expressed by its nuclear translocation [48].
SIRT1 is also phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (cyclin
B/Cdk1), which increase its activity and regulate cell-cycle
progression [49]. This is the first report identifying AMPK as a
kinase that functionally modifies SIRT1, increases SIRT1
phosphorylation, and alters SIRT1 translocation upon NaB
treatment. Growing evidence indicates that SIRT1 overexpression
and several SIRT1 activators have beneficial effects on glucose
homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in obese mice models. Liver￾specific deletion of the Sirt1 gene in mice is reported to cause liver
steatosis, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress in various organs
[40]. Our study clearly showed that AMPK and SIRT1 positively
regulate the rictor–mTOR association underlying NaB treatment,
thereby triggering AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 and improving
insulin signaling. However, the hepatic overexpression of a
dominant negative form of raptor enhances AKT phosphorylation
and restores insulin sensitivity in K/KAy mice with genetic
obesity-associated insulin resistance [50]. Consistently, we found
that the interaction of raptor and mTOR was enhanced, while
that of rictor and mTOR was suppressed under insulin-resistant
conditions; this was restored by NaB treatment, resulting in
improved AKT phosphorylation. The net effect of AMPK on
AKT-mediated insulin signaling is complex and involves multiple
targets. Although AMPK activation enhances insulin sensitivity,
the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Indeed, AMPK
activators, such as AICAR or adiponectin, enhance the effect of
insulin on AKT activation [51,52]. Further, PI3K functions
downstream of AMPK to regulate AKT activity in neuronal
polarization [53]. PI3K activity of muscle is reported to be
diminished in mice with a muscle-specific deletion of Sirt1 [54].
Several growth factors activate mTORC2 via PI3K, and insulin￾stimulated PI3K signaling is reported to promote mTORC2–
ribosome binding activity [55]. We found that PI3K inhibitor
blocked NaB-augmented mTORC2 complexes, but did not inhibit
the phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of SIRT1.
Therefore, we propose that the NaB signaling pathway modulates
cellular energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity by AMPK
activation and subsequent regulation of AKT phosphorylation
through the modification of SIRT1, PI3K, and mTORC1/2.
ROS or lipid peroxidation products activate the hepatic stellate
cells (HSCs) and stimulate the production of extracellular matrix
proteins, including type I collagen, in them [56]. Thus, ROS are
important to the development of liver fibrosis. Nrf2 is essential for
cellular protective mechanisms against ROS, electrophiles, or
oxidative stresses-induced inflammation through the transcription￾al activation of antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-dependent
expressions of genes encoding enzymes such as NQO1, HO-1,
GSTs, and TRX [37]. Studies have indicated that high-fat or
MCD diets resulted in more severe NAFLD/NASH in Nrf2-null
mice than wild-type mice [27,57]. Moreover, MCD diet substan￾tially increased the expression of NF-kB p65 subunit in Nrf2-

deficient mice liver [57]. Furthermore, NF-kB pathway or NF-kB
p65 subunit antagonizes the activation of the Nrf2–ARE pathway
[58]. This indicates that Nrf2 plays a pivotal role in protection
against the development of NAFLD/NASH. Interestingly, Nrf2
expression colocalized with expression of desmin and a-SMA,
which are markers for quiescent and activated HSCs and activated
HSCs, respectively, in MIYAIRI 588-treated rat livers (Figure S8),
thereby suggesting that MIYAIRI 588-induced Nrf2 expression
directly inhibited HSC activation and liver fibrogenesis by
protecting against oxidative stress. Further, MIYAIRI 588 induced
marked expression of Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated proteins HO-1 and
NQO1 in the liver. Thus, the suppression of hepatic inflammation
and oxidative stress is caused by both the reduction of gut-derived
endotoxin levels and induction of MIYAIRI 588-mediated Nrf2
expression in the liver, which are important for preventing
NAFLD progression. Interestingly, while Nrf2 colocalizes a part of
GST-P expression in the liver of MIYAIRI 588-treated rats, GST￾P expression was found even without Nrf2 in CDAA-diet-fed rat
livers (Figure S9). Although GST-P level is markedly induced in
preneoplastic foci and nodules of the liver, it is a phase II
detoxification enzyme [59]. GST-P has been found to be a target
gene of Nrf2 [60]. Thus, our findings suggested that GST-P￾positive foci represent a distinct feature of the preneoplastic region
of liver underlying dependent or independent on Nrf2 expression.
Oxidative stress or chemopreventive agents disrupt the seques￾tration of Nrf2 by Keap1, thereby permitting the nuclear
translocation of Nrf2 [37,61]. Keap1–a substrate adaptor protein
for the Cul 3-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase–negatively controls
the activity of Nrf2 at the protein level by polyubiquitination and
degradation, to maintain low basal levels of Nrf2 [62]. In response
to chemopreventive compounds, cysteine residues in Keap1 are
modified and Nrf2 is released from the Nrf2/Keap1 complex,
resulting in the stabilization and activation of Nrf2. These findings
are largely consistent with our results indicating that NaB stabilizes
the expression of Nrf2 by facilitating the escape from ubiquitina￾tion, thereby prolonging the half-life of Nrf2 protein. Evidence
suggests that more complex regulatory mechanisms may be
involved in the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE machinery. Interestingly, a
recent study demonstrated that AMPK induces HO-1 gene
expression in vascular and arteries cells via Nrf2 induction and
ARE activation [63]. PI3K-AKT pathway can also trigger the
Nrf2 activation [64]. In the present study, our pharmacological
investigation and siRNA knockdown experiments indicated that
NaB-mediated AMPK activation induced the phosphorylation

and nuclear translocation of SIRT1, thereby leading to the
increasing assembly of mTORC2 and phosphorylation of AKT at
Ser473, which in turn induced Nrf2 expression and activation.
Consistently, our findings also indicated that MIYAIRI 588-
produced NaB activates the AMPK/SIRT1/PI3K/mTORC2/
AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway in the liver. Notably, our observa￾tions revealed a new mechanism whereby treatment with
MIYAIRI 588 designates the AMPK activation as a starting point
and regulates different pathophysiological events, such as lipid and
energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and oxidative stress
response, through consistent and systematic signaling pathways,
thereby causing pronounced suppression of NAFLD progression
(Figure 10). Thus, the manipulation of gut microbiota by
probiotics can help counteract the adverse effects on the liver
and augment other therapeutic options for NAFLD. Although
further investigations are required, we believe that our findings will
facilitate the development of preventive and therapeutic interven￾tions for NAFLD.

administered after CDAA diet feeding for 2 weeks. Double
immunofluorescence staining showed the localization of GST-P
(green) and Nrf2 (red) in the liver sections. A similar size of GST-P
positive foci in the tissues sections was investigated both in the
CDAA diet and the CDAA diet plus MIYAIRI 588 groups. A
merged image of GST-P and Nrf2 staining is presented in the right
column. Nuclei (blue) were stained with TOTO-3. Data are
representative of 6 individual liver sections. Scale bars = 20 mm.
