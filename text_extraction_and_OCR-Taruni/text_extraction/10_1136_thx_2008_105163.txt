Abstract
Background: Although exercise training has beneficial effects on
skeletal muscle bioenergetics and exercise performance in patients
with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it may
also be associated with increased quadriceps oxidative and
nitrosative stress. The aim of this study was to explore quadriceps
oxidative and nitrosative stress in patients with severe COPD, both
before and after a 3 week endurance exercise programme, and to
identify the nature of the oxidatively modified proteins.
Methods: Reactive carbonyls, hydroxynonenal–protein adducts,
antioxidant enzymes, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and 3-
nitrotyrosine levels were determined in the quadriceps (pre- and
post-exercise) of 15 patients with severe COPD and seven healthy
controls using immunoblotting (one- and two-dimensional
electrophoresis), activity assays and mass spectrometry.
Results: At baseline, muscle levels of reactive carbonyls, which
were negatively associated with muscle strength and exercise
tolerance, were significantly higher in patients than in controls.
Moreover, baseline hydroxynonenal–protein adducts, superoxide
dismutase activity, inducible NOS and 3-nitrotyrosine
immunoreactivity levels were also significantly increased in the
quadriceps of patients compared with controls. In patients, chronic
exercise induced a significant rise in inducible NOS levels and a
fourfold increase in protein nitration. Chronic endurance exercise


induced tyrosine nitration of muscle enolase 3β, aldolase A,
triosephosphate isomerase, creatine kinase, carbonic anhydrase III,
myoglobin and uracil DNA glycosylase in the quadriceps of patients,
while contractile protein alpha-1 actin was nitrated only in patients
exhibiting muscle loss (post hoc analysis). Superoxide dismutase
activity increased after the exercise programme only in controls.
Conclusions: In severe COPD, chronic endurance exercise induces
increased tyrosine nitration of quadriceps proteins involved in
glycolysis, energy distribution, carbon dioxide hydration, muscle
oxygen transfer, DNA repair and contractile function in patients
exhibiting systemic effects of the disease.
