Introduction
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS) is one of the most common pre-malignant disorders
and affects approximately 3.5% of the population over 50
years of age.1-3 IgG and IgA MGUS are defined by a M-protein
less than 30 g/L, bone marrow (BM) plasma cell percentage
less than 10%, and absence of signs or symptoms related to
multiple myeloma (MM) (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency,
anemia, or bone lesions) or other lymphoproliferative malig￾nancies such as Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM),
immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, chronic lym￾phocytic leukemia (CLL), or B-cell lymphoma.3,4 For IgM
MGUS, there is some controversy concerning the diagnostic
criteria. In the Second International Workshop on WM, a con￾sensus panel defined IgM MGUS by the presence of an IgM
M-protein (irrespective of IgM concentration) without bone
marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma,5
whereas the Mayo Clinic criteria require less than 10% BM
involvement and IgM M-protein less than 30 g/L6 (Online
Supplementary Table S1). 
There is an average risk of progression to MM or, to a less￾er extent, other lymphoproliferative disorders of 1% per
year. Typically, patients with IgG or IgA MGUS progress to
MM, and patients with IgM MGUS progress to WM or other
lymphoproliferative disorders7 (Figure 1). Light-chain MGUS
is the precursor of light-chain MM,1,8,9 and is defined by an
abnormal k/λ free light-chain (FLC) ratio, increase in concen￾tration of the involved light-chain, and absence of expression
of a monoclonal peak of immunoglobulin heavy-chain in the
serum on immunofixation.1 In contrast, in renal disease and
in case of polyclonal B-cell activation there may be increased
levels of k and k chains, but with a normal ratio. Light-chain
MGUS has a prevalence of approximately 0.7-0.8% in per￾The clinical relevance and management of monoclonal gammopathy of

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is one of the most common pre-malignant disorders. IgG and
IgA monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are precursor conditions of multiple myeloma; light￾chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance of light-chain multiple myeloma; and IgM monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia and other lymphoproliferative dis￾orders. Clonal burden, as determined by bone marrow plasma cell percentage or M-protein level, as well as biological
characteristics, including heavy chain isotype and light chain production, are helpful in predicting risk of progression
of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to symptomatic disease. Furthermore, alterations in the
bone marrow microenvironment of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients result in an
increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, infections, osteoporosis, and bone fractures. In addition, the small
clone may occasionally be responsible for severe organ damage through the production of a monoclonal protein that
has autoantibody activity or deposits in tissues. These disorders are rare and often require therapy directed at eradi￾cation of the underlying plasma cell or lymphoplasmacytic clone. In this review, we provide an overview of the clin￾ical relevance of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We also give general recommendations of
how to diagnose and manage patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

Clinical relevance of MGUS
haematologica | 2014; 99(6) 985
Figure 1. Model for the mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of MGUS. Obesity, exposure to pesticides, radiation
exposure, and personal history of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions and infections are associated with an increased risk of
MGUS. In addition, there is a genetic predisposition to MGUS. (A) Primary immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) translocations with 5 recurrent
chromosomal partners (4p16, 6p21, 11q13, 16q23, 20q11) and hyperdiploidy are early events and associated with the initiation of limited
clonal plasma cell proliferation in non-IgM MGUS. Acquisition of secondary chromosomal abnormalities (such as deletions of (parts of) chro￾mosomes or secondary chromosomal translocations) and mutations involving individual genes results in the stepwise progression from MGUS
to newly diagnosed symptomatic MM, and finally aggressive forms of MM such as sPCL or extramedullary MM. During this process there is a
progressive replacement of normal/polyclonal plasma cells (orange) by clonal plasma cells (blue). Progression of the plasma cell disorder is
also accompanied by altered interactions of the tumor cells with various components of their microenvironment such as osteoclasts, endothe￾lial cells, and cells of the immune system. Recent evidence suggests the presence of intraclonal heterogeneity in MGUS, adding a further level
of genetic complexity to the initiation and progression of myeloma. (B) Progression from IgM MGUS to symptomatic Waldenström’s macroglob￾ulinemia also involves a series of genetic changes (activating mutations, inactivating mutations, and chromosomal abnormalities) and altered
interactions with the microenvironment. This results in a progressive decrease in normal B cells and normal plasma cells (orange) and increase
in clonal B cells and clonal plasma cells (purple).

sons aged 50 years and older.1,2 Smoldering (asympto￾matic) MM (SMM) is a pre-malignant disorder with a
higher tumor burden and higher risk of progression com￾pared to MGUS (for a definition see Online Supplementary
Table S1). Smoldering WM and idiopathic Bence Jones
proteinuria are equivalents of SMM in IgM and light￾chain gammopathies, respectively (Online Supplementary
Table S1). 
The importance of MGUS not only lies in the increased
risk of developing a hematologic malignancy, but the
small clone may also be responsible for severe organ dam￾age through the production of a toxic M-protein which
has autoantibody activity or deposits in tissues. In addi￾tion, recent studies show that pre-malignant clone￾induced alterations in the BM microenvironment result in
an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, infec￾tions, and osteoporosis. Here, we will discuss the clinical
relevance of MGUS, and provide recommendations for
diagnosis and follow up. 
Methodology
Clinical experts on plasma cell dyscrasias developed these
recommendations based on evidence of published data
through February 2014. Expert consensus was used to sug￾gest recommendations in case of insufficient data. Grades
of recommendations were assigned using the GRADE crite￾ria for grade of recommendation (Online Supplementary
Table S2). The recommendations were circulated among the
panel members and also discussed in the 2013 EMN Trialist
meeting. The manuscript subsequently underwent revision
in two rounds until the EMN experts reached a consensus. 
Clinical importance of MGUS
1. Regression
Disappearance of the M-protein occurs in approximate￾ly 2-5% of patients with MGUS.4,7,10 The majority of these
patients have low initial concentrations of M-protein.4
Disappearance of M-protein is often observed after stop￾ping immunosuppressive treatment or initiation of treat￾ment for other disorders such as autoimmune diseases and
infections.4,10,11 
2. Progression
Analysis of pre-diagnostic serum samples has shown
that MM is virtually always preceded by MGUS.8,9 It is
unknown whether WM is preceded by IgM MGUS in the
majority of the cases.
Progression of MGUS to MM or other related malignan￾cies occurs at a rate of approximately 1% per year.4,10,12
There is no reduction of the risk of progression, even after
25 or 35 years of follow up. However, many MGUS
patients are elderly and will die from unrelated diseases.
The risk of progression for light-chain MGUS is lower
when compared to conventional MGUS. Only 3 out of
133 light-chain MGUS patients experienced progression to
MM during 1100 patient-years of follow up (progression
rate 0.27% per year). All 3 patients developed light-chain
MM.1 Similarly, in a German study, none of 34 light-chain
MGUS cases had progression during a median observation
time of five years.2 It cannot be excluded that a small pro￾portion of the patients with apparent light-chain MGUS,
do not have a true clonal disorder but rather renal dysfunc￾tion or polyclonal activation.1
Predictors of malignant transformation in MGUS
Presenting features as well as the dynamics of the plas￾ma cell clone during the first years of follow up are helpful
in predicting risk of progression of MGUS to symptomatic
disease (Table 1), and, therefore, in guiding follow up.
Clonal burden as determined by BM plasma cell percent￾age10,12-16 and/or M-protein size4,10,12-15,17-23 is an important
risk factor for malignant transformation of MGUS.
Furthermore, Rosinol et al. showed that a progressive
increase of the M-protein (evolving MGUS) is predictive
of progression.14 
Biological characteristics of the clone also have predic￾tive value in conventional MGUS and these include heavy
chain isotype (IgA/IgM > IgG);4,10,14,17,18,20,21,24 light chain pro￾duction as determined by abnormal serum FLC ratio17,25 or
presence of Bence Jones proteinuria;10,13,23 detection of cir￾culating clonal B cells26 or plasma cells;20 increased bone
resorption in bone biopsy;27 clonal heterogeneity;28 DNA
aneuploidy assessed by flow cytometry;13 and abnormal
metaphase cytogenetics.28 Gene expression profiling of
purified plasma cells has recently been demonstrated to
have prognostic value.29 It is currently unknown whether
specific chromosomal abnormalities, including del(17p)
and t(4;14), are predictive of malignant progression in
MGUS.
In addition, suppression of non-clonal BM plasma cells,
based on multiparameter flow cytometric analysis, is a
risk factor for progression13,30 (Figure 2). This explains the
predictive value of reduction of polyclonal serum
immunoglobulins.10,13,21,23,31 Also several imaging tech￾niques may prove to be useful in predicting progression of
MGUS. Detection of focal lesions by MRI at baseline22,29,32
or development of focal lesions by MRI or PET-CT pre￾dicted for progression to active MM.32 However, there is
ongoing discussion of whether patients with focal lesions
on MRI should be considered as having early myeloma
requiring therapy. 
There are currently no data available on extrinsic factors
that promote progression. For instance, patients with pre￾transplant MGUS do not seem to be at an increased risk of
progression because of chronic immunosuppression.33
When IgM MGUS is evaluated as a separate entity, the
average risk for progression is approximately 1.5% per
year.7 Serum M-protein and albumin levels were inde￾pendent predictors of progression in one study,7 whereas
in another study M-protein concentration, hemoglobin
level, and male sex independently predicted for malignant
evolution.34 IgM MGUS and IgM-related disorders (charac￾terized by the presence of specific properties of the IgM
M-protein without evidence of underlying lymphoma)
have a similar probability of transformation into a lym￾phoid malignancy.35
So far no predictive factors for progression have been
identified for light-chain MGUS. It is unknown whether
higher levels of the involved light-chain result in a higher
risk of transformation in light chain MGUS. However, in
idiopathic Bence Jones proteinuria serum FLC ratio (<0.01
or >100) is associated with a higher risk of progression to
MM or AL amyloidosis.36 Other prognostic factors in idio￾pathic Bence Jones proteinuria include size of urine M￾protein, BM plasma cell percentage, serum creatinine, and
reduction of all 3 uninvolved immunoglobulins.36

Prediction models
Rajkumar et al. constructed a model for predicting risk of
progression based on the size of the M-protein (≥15 g/L),
type of M-protein (non-IgG), and the presence of an
abnormal FLC ratio.17 The absolute risk of progression at
20 years was 5% for patients without risk factors (low￾risk), but the risk increased to 21%, 37%, and 58% for
patients with 1 (low-intermediate risk), 2 (high-intermedi￾ate risk), or 3 (high risk) of these risk factors, respectively
(Table 2). Another prognostic stratification system was
proposed by Perez-Persona et al. which is based on the
percentage of aberrant plasma cells and DNA aneuploidy,
both assessed by flow cytometry.13 Also combination of
percentage of aberrant plasma cells with presence of an
evolving M-protein identifies 3 different risk groups30
(Table 2).
3. Secondary MGUS
During the course of MM, new monoclonal gam￾mopathies of an isotype distinct from the original MM can
emerge. This entity has been called secondary MGUS and
occurs in 10-73% of MM patients after autologous stem
cell transplantion (autoSCT),37-44 and in 1.6-33% of non￾transplant patients.37,45 Clinicians should be aware that sec￾ondary MGUS does not represent disease recurrence or
development of a new malignancy to avoid unnecessary
treatment. Oligoclonal reconstitution of the immune sys￾tem after myeloablative conditioning and impaired T-cell
regulation of B-cell proliferation in the BM after autoSCT
are likely implicated in the pathogenesis of secondary
MGUS. 
Interestingly, the quality of response is better among
patients with secondary MGUS.40,42,44,45 This may explain

the superior overall survival in non-transplant patients
with secondary MGUS when compared to MM patients
who did not develop secondary MGUS.37 After autoSCT
this survival advantage was observed in some studies40-42,44
but not in others.37-39,43 
Also after allogeneic (allo)-SCT development of second￾ary MGUS has been described. Myeloablative condition￾ing, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and graft-versus￾host disease (GVHD) are associated with a higher inci￾dence of monoclonal or oligoclonal bands.46 
4. MGUS-associated conditions without direct 
relationship to the M-protein
MGUS is often diagnosed in the workup of another dis￾ease. Since MGUS has a relatively high prevalence and
serum immune electrophoresis is performed in patients
with certain clinical symptoms, it is often difficult to dif￾ferentiate true pathogenetic associations from coincidental
relationships.47 
In this section, we describe disorders that probably have
a causal relationship to MGUS through clone-related alter￾ations in the BM microenvironment, such as suppression
of normal plasma cells and osteoclast activation. However,
it cannot be fully excluded that part of the increased risk
for these conditions from MGUS is due to other underly￾ing conditions that are prevalent in persons who are tested
for monoclonal gammopathies.
Infections
MGUS patients have an approximately 2-fold increased
risk of developing bacterial and viral infections compared
to controls.48,49 This can be explained by underlying
immunodeficiency including reduced levels of uninvolved
immunoglobulins in approximately 25% of the MGUS
patients.3,4,10,13,18,21,50,51 In addition, MGUS patients have sig￾nificantly lower absolute numbers of both CD4+ and CD8+
T cells compared to healthy controls.26
Osteoporosis 
MGUS patients have an increased risk of osteoporosis
and fractures (axial >distal).47,52-56 Conversely, the preva￾lence of MGUS is 3.6% in patients with osteoporosis,
compared to 2% in patients without osteoporosis.57 The
prevalence of MGUS is even higher in patients presenting
with acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures (15%).58 There
was no difference in risk of malignant transformation in
patients with or without fracture.55 Importantly, patients
with osteoporosis or fractures should be carefully evaluat￾N.W.C.J. van de Donk et al.

ed to exclude the presence of MM (see section on diagnos￾tic considerations).
Interestingly, MGUS patients have already an altered
bone microstructure when compared to healthy controls.53
In addition, some studies show that biochemical markers
of bone formation are reduced in MGUS, whereas mark￾ers of bone resorption are increased compared to healthy
controls.59-61 This may be related to elevated levels of the
Wnt pathway inhibitor DKK1 resulting in reduced bone
formation,53 combined with increased MIP-1α levels and
RANKL/OPG ratio leading to increased bone resorp￾tion.53,59
Malignancies
There is an approximately 2-8-fold increased risk of
developing myeloid malignancies including myelodysplas￾tic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia, and poly￾cythemia vera in MGUS.62,63 Risk factors include IgG/IgA
isotype and M-protein greater than 15 g/L.62,63 Host- and
MGUS-related factors that contribute to development of
myeloid malignancies remain to be defined.62 However,
the altered BM microenvironment may play an important
role. 
Furthermore, MGUS patients have an approximately
1.5-fold increased risk of developing a non-hematologic
malignancy.62,64 Apart from a biological association, the
higher incidence can also be a reflection of increased sur￾veillance of MGUS patients leading to the detection of ear￾lier cases with cancer. In addition, part of the association
can be explained by widespread use of serum elec￾trophoresis as a diagnostic tool in patients suspected of
having malignant disease.62,64 Interestingly, first-degree rel￾atives of MGUS65 and MM66 patients also have a small
(approx. 10%) but significantly increased risk of develop￾ing solid tumors. 
Thrombosis
Several studies report an approximately 2-3-fold
increased risk of developing deep venous thrombosis or
pulmonary embolism in MGUS patients.67-70 Also superfi￾cial venous thrombosis seems to be associated with
MGUS.47 In addition, a population-based study shows that
risk of arterial thrombosis, including coronary artery dis￾ease and cerebrovascular disease, is increased in MGUS.68
On the other hand, 2 studies fail to find an association
between MGUS and venous or arterial thrombosis.71,72 
Prothrombotic changes, such as increases in FVIII and
von Willebrand factor in MGUS to similar levels as
observed in newly diagnosed MM, may be causally relat￾ed to the increased thrombosis risk.73 The increased risk of
venous and arterial thrombosis was only observed in IgG
and IgA MGUS, but not in IgM MGUS.68 Risk of thrombo￾sis did not vary by M-protein level in one study,68 whereas
in 2 studies risk of venous thrombosis was increased in
patients with higher M-protein levels.72,74
Survival
MGUS patients have a poorer survival than the general
population.4,18,48,51 For example, in a large cohort of MGUS
patients, median survival was 8.1 years, whereas it was
11.8 years for age- and sex-matched Minnesota residents.4
Excess mortality is not only caused by development of
MM and other lymphoproliferative diseases, but there is
also an increased risk of dying of myeloid malignancies,
non-hematologic cancers, bacterial infections, heart disor￾ders, liver diseases, and renal disorders.18,48,51 This may be
explained by a combination of pathogenic mechanisms
related to MGUS as well as factors related to co-existing
unrelated diseases which lead to medical workup eventu￾ally leading to detection of MGUS.48 This indicates that
after exclusion of MM and other lymphoproliferative dis￾orders, attention should also be paid to the presence of co￾existing diseases that may contribute to the increased
mortality in MGUS. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that
the increased risk of dying due to infections, renal dis￾eases, and heart disorders is a reflection of early MM,
WM, amyloidosis, or another lymphoproliferative malig￾nancy.48
5. M-protein related disorders: presence or 
development of symptoms related to the M-protein
Sometimes the small clone in MGUS is responsible for
severe organ damage through the production of an M-pro￾tein which has autoantibody activity or deposits in tissues
(AL amyloidosis, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition
disease, and type I cryoglobulinemia).75 Pathogenesis of
some of these associated disorders is not well understood
and may be related to both M-protein and growth factors
produced by the underlying clone, such as in POEMS syn￾drome. 
M-protein related disorders with systemic manifestations 
Some of the M-protein related disorders have multi￾organ involvement. In AL amyloidosis there is production
of misfolded immunoglobulin light-chains that deposit in
tissues as amyloid fibrils leading to organ dysfunction.
Major clinical manifestations include heart failure,
hepatosplenomegaly, nephrotic syndrome, macroglossia,
carpal tunnel syndrome, diarrhea, sensorimotor neuropa￾thy, and autonomic neuropathy. 
Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate
when cooled and re-dissolve when heated, resulting in
temperature-dependency of clinical manifestations such as
Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis, and cold urticaria.
Other cryoglobulinemic symptoms include peripheral
neuropathy, renal failure, and skin vasculitis. MGUS may
be accompanied by type I or type II cryoglobulinemia.76
Type I consists of monoclonal immunoglobulins (typically
IgM or IgG), while in type II cryoglobulinemia, which is
often associated with HCV infection, there is a monoclon￾al autoantibody (mainly IgM) which binds to the Fc por￾tion of polyclonal antibodies.76
The main features of POEMS syndrome include
polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-pro￾tein (mainly IgG-76 and IgA-λ), sclerotic bone changes,
and skin changes. VEGF levels are often markedly elevated
and correlate with disease activity.75 
Neurological diseases
IgM MGUS is associated with (demyelinating) peripher￾al neuropathy. Half of the patients with IgM MGUS and
peripheral neuropathy have anti-myelin-associated glyco￾protein (MAG) antibodies. However, the IgM M-protein
can also be directed to other neural antigens including
GD1b ganglioside, sulphatide, and chondroitin sulphate,
thus leading to immune-mediated nerve damage.77
Rituximab is effective in part of the patients with IgM
MGUS-associated neuropathy.77,78 The association
between IgA and IgG MGUS and neuropathy is less clear,
and MGUS may be an incidental finding without relation￾Clinical relevance of MGUS

ship to the neuropathy,77 when AL amyloidosis and
POEMS syndrome have been excluded. Especially, in case
of neuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy
with a rapidly progressive disease course an underlying
hematologic malignancy has to excluded.79
Blood diseases
Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is frequently associated
with MGUS (mainly IgM-k). The monoclonal
immunoglobulin binds to erythrocyte carbohydrate anti￾gens resulting in hemolytic anemia, Raynaud phenome￾non, and acrocyanosis after cold exposure.80 Warm anti￾body autoimmune hemolytic anemia in MGUS is a very
rare phenomenon.
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is more fre￾quent in MGUS patients than in the general population.81
The M-protein may act as an anti-platelet autoantibody.81
Acquired von Willebrand disease is an infrequent compli￾cation of MGUS caused by the M-protein that interferes
with platelet or collagen binding or accelerates VWF clear￾ance from the circulation.82 Autoantibody-mediated
acquired deficiency of FVIII in association with MGUS is
very rare.83

The M-protein seems to play a role in the development
of several skin disorders including plane xanthoma and
Schnitzler syndrome. However, the contributing role of
cytokines released by the plasma cell clone cannot be
excluded. In plane xanthomas with monoclonal gam￾mopathy (mainly IgG), the M-protein has antilipoprotein
activity in some patients. This results in enhanced lipid
accumulation by macrophages and complement activa￾tion.84,85 In Schnitzler syndrome there is deposition of para￾protein (IgM-k is most common) at the dermoepidermal
junction and in capillary walls which probably contributes
to development of chronic urticaria, intermittent fever,
arthralgia, bone pain, and lymphadenopathy.86 Treatment
with anakinra can be very effective.86 Acquired C1
esterase inhibitor deficiency leading to angio-edema may
also be related to the presence of an M-protein with C1
esterase inhibitor-binding activity.87
The contributing role of the M-protein and/or growth
factors secreted by the clonal cells is even less clear for
other skin diseases that are associated with MGUS includ￾ing scleromyxedema (mainly IgG-λ), scleredema (mainly
IgG-k), necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (mainly IgG-k),
Sweet syndrome, and pyoderma gangrenosum.88
Metabolic disturbances
Hyperlipidemia is a rare condition in MGUS (mainly
IgA), and may be accompanied by xanthomas, hypervis￾cosity syndrome, and/or atherosclerosis. Binding of the
M-protein to lipoproteins, LDL receptor, or lipoprotein
lipases results in reduced lipid degradation.89
Renal diseases
Various kidney disorders are the result of toxic M-pro￾teins produced by the MGUS clone, including monoclonal
immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD, which
includes light-chain deposition disease (LCDD), heavy￾chain deposition disease (HCDD), and light- and heavy￾chain deposition disease (LHCDD)), light-chain proximal
tubulopathy (with or without Fanconi syndrome),
immunotactoid glomerulopathy, proliferative glomeru￾lonephritis with monoclonal Ig deposits (PGNMID), and
type 1 and type 2 cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis.90-
92 In these conditions, the M-protein is the direct cause of
the kidney disease and these disorders are characterized
by the presence of monoclonal deposits in the kidney.
Importantly, M-protein-associated kidney diseases have a
high recurrence rate after kidney transplantation.
Recently, the term monoclonal gammopathy of renal sig￾nificance (MGRS) has been proposed for these pathologi￾cal conditions, to discriminate them from asymptomatic
MGUS.90 Importantly, although light-chain MGUS has a
low rate of malignant progression, 23% of the patients
have or will develop renal disease.1
Treatment of M-protein related disorders
Treatment of M-protein-related disorders is dependent
on severity. Institution of supportive care alone may be
sufficient in cases with only mild symptoms. However, in
general, the most effective treatment of M-protein-related
disorders is directed to the underlying clone. Since this
approach is potentially toxic, clone-directed therapy
should only be considered in cases of aggressive and dis￾abling disease. In addition, therapy directed at eradication
of the MGUS clone is only justified when there is a clear
causal relationship between MGUS and the associated dis￾order. 
Rituximab monotherapy is recommended in cases of
IgM-related disease, such as anti-MAG polyneuropathy.
Addition of chemotherapy to rituximab can be considered
in cases with severe symptoms and the need for rapid
tumor reduction. Since tumor burden is low in IgM-related
disease, the duration of immunochemotherapy is general￾ly shorter compared to patients with symptomatic WM. 
In non-IgM MGUS-related disorders therapy should rely
on antimyeloma agents. In younger patients (≤65-70
years) high-dose melphalan with autoSCT to induce a
long-term remission can be considered if the symptoms
are severe, progressive and/or disabling, like in POEMS
syndrome. Induction therapy preceding autoSCT is prob￾ably not needed in case of a small clone, but it may be
advantageous for patients with a poor performance status
due to the MGUS-associated disorder, and in case with a
significant plasma cell clone (M-protein ≥10 g/L). A
lenalidomide-based regimen is the first choice in patients
with neuropathy, while bortezomib has the highest effica￾cy in M-protein-associated renal disorders, since it rapidly
reduces tumor load and toxic M-proteins. In addition,
bortezomib clearance is independent of renal function.92
Diagnostic considerations
Patients with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities,
which may be attributable to the underlying MGUS
clone
MGUS patients are frequently identified when serum
protein electrophoresis is requested as part of a diagnostic
assessment for various symptoms including fatigue, recur￾rent infections and back pain, but also in cases with labo￾ratory abnormalities such as anemia, hypercalcemia, ele￾vated total protein, or renal failure, as well as osteolytic
bone lesions. In these settings, we recommend excluding
the presence of MM, WM, AL amyloidosis, or CLL by lab￾oratory tests (complete blood count with differential,
blood chemistry (including calcium, albumin, and creati￾nine), serum and urine protein electrophoresis with

immunofixation, and measurement of FLCs), BM biopsy
and aspiration, and imaging studies (grade of recommen￾dation 1C). These investigations are also recommended in
patients with a monoclonal gammopathy and osteoporo￾sis, especially when this combination is present in males
and pre-menopausal women. 
Asymptomatic patients
An Italian study with 1217 patients showed that the risk
of finding a plasma cell infiltration of 10% or over in
patients without bone pain with an M-protein of 15 g/L or
less or of 10 g/L or less is very low (7.3% and 5.0%,
respectively). However, this risk is dependent on IgH iso￾type (4.7% and 3.5% for IgG isotype; 20.5% and 14.0%
for IgA).93 These data are in agreement with a Dutch study
that showed that the presence of M-protein concentration
10-15 g/L or more is an important parameter in discrimi￾nating between MM and non-myeloma patients.94 No sep￾arate analysis was reported for IgG and IgA M-proteins.
The Italian study also showed that the probability of find￾ing bone lesions at skeletal survey is very low for both IgG
(1.7% and 2%) and IgA isotypes (6.4% and 0.0% for M￾protein ≤15 and ≤10 g/L, respectively).93 There are current￾ly no data available to verify whether the FLC assay is of
additional value in discriminating between MM/SMM and
MGUS. 
Based on these data, most experts do not routinely rec￾ommend BM examination in asymptomatic patients with
apparent IgG MGUS if the serum M-protein is 15 g/L or
less and there is no end-organ damage, until there is evi￾dence of progression to symptomatic disease (grade of rec￾ommendation 2C). BM examination should be part of the
diagnostic workup for all IgA and IgM M-proteins.
Imaging is not routinely recommended in patients with a
serum IgG M-protein of 15 g/L or less or IgA M-protein of
10 g/L or less without bone pain (grade of recommenda￾tion 2C). For all other patients with apparent conventional
MGUS imaging should be considered (skeletal survey for
non-IgM M-protein; CT scan of chest, abdomen, and
pelvis for IgM MGUS) (grade of recommendation 2C). In
addition, it can be justified to exclude bone marrow inves￾tigation and imaging from the diagnostic workup when
there is limited life expectancy because of advanced age or
comorbidities. 
Although conventional X-rays are still considered the
gold standard for diagnosing MM bone disease,95 low-dose
whole-body computed tomography (CT), which is faster
and more comfortable for the patient, may be a good alter￾native in MGUS as previously suggested by the IMWG
consensus panel on imaging techniques95 (grade of recom￾mendation 2C). Importantly, CT imaging has superior sen￾sitivity and reveals more lesions compared to convention￾al radiography, which may, therefore, lead to earlier insti￾tution of therapy. The value of earlier treatment is current￾ly unknown. At this moment, we do not recommend
whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
positron emission tomography (PET)/CT except in the
clinical trial setting. 
There are currently no data available to guide diagnostic
workup in light-chain MGUS. We do not recommend as
routine BM examination and imaging in asymptomatic
patients with apparent light-chain MGUS. However, BM
evaluation and imaging should be considered in patients
with high levels of the involved light-chain (e.g. FLC ratio
>10 or <0.10). 
Altogether these recommendations will reduce invasive
procedures during diagnostic workup in asymptomatic
patients with low-risk monoclonal gammopathy.
Other considerations
At diagnosis, not only presence of MM, WM, or other
malignant disorders has to be excluded, but also other
MGUS-related disorders. Fat, BM, or rectum biopsy with
Congo red staining should be performed when AL amyloi￾dosis is suspected. In cases of significant proteinuria or
renal insufficiency kidney biopsy is often indicated.
Immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies are
essential to demonstrate monoclonal deposits and their
pattern of organization.90,92 Other tests may be useful
under certain circumstances (Table 3). 
Furthermore, since there is an increased risk of fractures
and osteoporosis in MGUS, it may be appropriate to eval￾uate patients for excessive bone loss by using dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), especially when other risk
factors for osteoporosis are present. Bisphosphonates
(alendronate or zoledronic acid) have been shown to
improve bone mineral density in MGUS patients with
osteopenia/osteoporosis or osteoporotic fractures (grade
of recommendation 1B).96,97 Patients with reduced bone
mineral density or prevalent fractures should receive treat￾ment with bisphosphonates,54 and also calcium and vita￾min D supplementation if dietary intake is insufficient.
Although the risk of venous thromboembolism in
MGUS is increased, the absolute risk is low. Therefore,
there is no indication for standard thrombosis prophylaxis.
Follow up
Since there is no decline in risk of progression, lifelong
follow up is generally advised for the majority of MGUS
patients to diagnose malignant transformation before the
onset of serious complications in order to avoid hospital￾izations and costs and to preserve quality of life.98
However, follow up can be optimized based on the
patient’s risk of progression and life expectancy. We rec￾ommend using the Mayo Clinic risk stratification model
to predict progression17 since the three prognostic factors
in this model can be easily determined in all MGUS
patients (grade of recommendation 1B) (Table 2). Follow
up consists of a careful history, physical examination, and
laboratory studies (quantification of M-protein, complete
blood count, creatinine, and calcium). Therapy should be
initiated only when symptomatic disease develops. 
There are currently no prospective data available regard￾ing the efficacy of monitoring and optimal frequency of
follow up in MGUS patients. However, a retrospective
SEER database analysis showed that complication rates of
fractures, acute kidney injury, cord compression, or hyper￾calcemia were lower in patients with follow up for MGUS
and subsequently developed MM or WM (n=1037) com￾pared to those patients who developed MM or WM with￾out preceding follow up (n=16392) (any complication:
20.8% vs. 32.6%) (Online Supplementary Table S3).99 In con￾trast, a smaller retrospective analysis from the Mayo
Clinic of symptomatic myeloma patients with preceding
MGUS (n=116) showed that optimal follow up (at least
every 3 years) did not result in reduced hospitalizations or
decreased myeloma-related complications, compared to
suboptimal follow up.98 Overall survival from the time of

myeloma diagnosis was similar in both groups.98
Progression between screening visits may contribute to
the inadequacy of follow up in this study.98 
Patients with intermediate risk (risk of progression at 20
years: 21-37% according to Mayo Clinic risk stratification
model17) or high-risk MGUS (risk of progression at 20
years: 58%) should be monitored more closely (at 6
months, and annually thereafter) than patients with low￾risk MGUS (risk of progression at 20 years: 5%) for whom
less frequent follow up can be justified (at 6 months, and
every 1-2 years thereafter) (grade of recommendation 2C)
(Table 4). Many patients can receive appropriate follow up
of MGUS in primary care. Alternatively, low-risk MGUS
patients may not need annual follow up, but only labora￾tory investigations or BM analysis when symptoms sug￾gestive of MM or related diseases develop. No follow up
can also be considered in elderly patients or in patients
with significant comorbidity with a short life expectancy.
Because of competing causes of death, these patients will
probably die before progression of MGUS. 
Although the progression rate in light-chain MGUS is
low (approx. 0.3% per year) there is a considerable risk of
developing renal disease.1 We, therefore, recommend that
patients with light-chain MGUS should receive follow up
at six months, and every year thereafter (grade of recom￾mendation 2C).1 MGUS patients with elevated free light￾chains should also be monitored for development of amy￾loidosis or LCDD by measuring NT-pro-BNP and urine
albumin during follow up. In patients with abnormal find￾ings, additional investigations may include 24-h urine for
total protein, echocardiography, and ultrasound for
organomegaly. 
These recommendations (Table 4) are partly based on
the 2010 IMWG guidelines100 with incorporation of life
expectancy.
Preventive strategies
There are currently no interventions to prevent or delay
progression of MGUS. Intervention approaches should
only be performed in the setting of a clinical trial.

M-protein ≤10 g/L. We also do not recommend to routinely perform BM examination and imaging in asymptomatic patients with apparent light-chain MGUS. However, BM evaluation
and imaging should be considered in patients with high levels of the involved light-chain (e.g. FLC ratio >10 or <0.10). Furthermore, bone marrow evaluation and imaging can be
excluded from the diagnostic workup in case of patients with limited life expectancy because of advanced age or co-morbidities. Otherwise bone marrow examination and imaging
are recommended. †

However, even in studies with high-risk MGUS, extensive
follow up and large numbers of patients will be required
to demonstrate a meaningful impact on survival and qual￾ity of life, in the absence of long-term adverse effects. 
Population screening
Screening of the general population is not recommended
outside of studies. It is also unknown whether early detec￾tion of a monoclonal gammopathy is beneficial among rel￾atives of MGUS, MM, or WM patients. Since there are
currently no intervention strategies available, together
with the low absolute risk of detecting MGUS or MM in
relatives, we recommend screening only as part of a
research protocol. 
Conclusions and future prospects
MGUS patients have an average risk of progression to
MM or, to a lesser extent, other lymphoproliferative dis￾orders of 1% per year. However, at the time of diagnosis
and during follow up attention should also be paid to the
presence of disorders related to autoantibody activity of
the M-protein or resulting from deposition of M-protein
in tissues. These M-protein-related disorders are rare but
may cause significant morbidity, thereby justifying clone￾directed therapy. In addition, there is emerging evidence
that the underlying plasma cell or lymphoplasmacytic
clone may also contribute to the development of rather
common disorders such as osteoporosis and venous
thrombosis through induction of alterations in the BM
microenvironment (Figure 3). Altogether this clearly

Criteria are partly based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria with some modifications100 #Risk of progression is predicted by using the Mayo Clinic risk strat￾ification model17. Low risk is defined by IgG isotype, M-protein <15 g/L, and normal FLC ratio. Cumulative probability of progression at 20 years for patients with low-risk, low inter￾mediate risk (one risk factor present), high-intermediate risk (two risk factors present), and high-risk MGUS (three risk factors present) is 5%, 21%, 37%, and 58%, respectively.17
Follow up should include careful history, physical examination (emphasis on symptoms and signs that may suggest progression to MM, WM, AL amyloidosis, or M-protein related
disorders), and laboratory studies (quantification of M-protein, complete blood count, creatinine, and calcium). In case of an abnormal free light-chain ratio with elevation of the
involved light-chain, NT-pro-BNP and urinary albumin should also be monitored during follow up to detect organ damage caused by light chains. In case a patient with evolving
MGUS, develops a M-protein ≥ 30 g/L and fulfils the SMM criteria, then follow up should be like in SMM (every 3-4 months). Further investigations are indicated if during follow up
new symptoms or signs develop that are suggestive of underlying MM, WM, or AL amyloidosis, or if a patient has abnormal laboratory results. Patients should be instructed to contact
their physician if there is any change in their clinical condition.
Figure 3. Associations between MGUS and other disorders. MGUS patients have a life-long risk of progression to MM or, to a lesser extent,
other lymphoproliferative disorders. In addition, MGUS is also associated with several conditions that may partly result from an altered BM
microenvironment due to the underlying plasma cell or lymphoplasmacytic clone. It cannot be fully excluded that part of the increased risk
for these conditions from MGUS is due to other underlying conditions that are prevalent in persons who are tested for monoclonal gam￾mopathies. Furhermore, several disorders are present or develop in MGUS patients due to deposition of the M-protein in tissues or because
of autoantibody activity of the M-protein.

demonstrates that the significance of MGUS, for both cli￾nicians and patients, has increased considerably over the
last years. We have incorporated these new data in rec￾ommendations for diagnostic evaluation and follow up.
These recommendations are personalized and based on
both life expectancy and risk of progression. We expect
that in the nearby future increased knowledge of mecha￾nisms underlying the progression of MGUS to MM or
WM results in a further improvement in the identification
of patients at high-risk of progression, which will hope￾fully lead to an even more tailored follow up with start of
therapy before serious complications develop.
