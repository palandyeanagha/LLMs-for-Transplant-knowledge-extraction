ABSTRACT
Among congenital malformations, heart defects 
are the most common type of anomaly, and 
these are associated with a high perinatal, long￾term morbidity and mortality. The objective of 
this update was to review the rate of prenatal 
detection, screening characteristics throughout the 
pregnancy, in both the first and second trimesters, 
indications for advanced echocardiography, 
and to establish a management algorithm in 
case of prenatal diagnosis of a congenital heart 
disease. Potential invasive and non-invasive 
tests and obstetric follow-up will be discussed 
here. Finally, the main characteristics of fetal 
therapy in heart anomalies will be reviewed, both 
cardiac interventions and intrauterine treatment 
of arrhythmias.
Key words: congenital heart disease, prenatal 
diagnosis, fetal therapy, screening.

INTRODUCTION
Heart conditions, which are the 
most common type of congenital 
malformations, occur in 1 % of 
newborn infants and are associated 
with a high perinatal morbidity 
and mortality.1
 Prenatal diagnosis 
allows to provide the family guidance 
on prognosis, plan an adequate 
obstetric follow-up, offer intrauterine 
m a n a g e m e n t f o r u n c o m m o n , 
especially selected cases, and, in case 
of a complex congenital heart disease 
(CHD), refer the pregnant woman 
to a tertiary care facility capable of 
providing neonatal diagnosis and 
management (through therapeutic 
catheterization and/or cardiovascular 
surgery), which has shown to reduce 
associated perinatal morbidity and 
mortality.1-3
Rate of prenatal detection
The rate of detection of CHD, even 
in developed countries, ranges between 
30 % and 60 %.2,4-5 An analysis of data 
provided by Belgium to the European 
Registration of Congenital Anomalies 
and Twins (EUROCAT) reported that 
the rate of prenatal detection in the 
1997-2012 period was 29.3 % for all 
CHD in general and 40.2 % for severe 
CHD.4
 The Netherlands has a national 
quality control program and the rate 
of prenatal detection there for all 
CHD was 59.7 %.2
 In addition, a recent 
systematic review,5
 which included 7 
studies and 4992 patients, reported 
a 45.1 % prenatal detection rate for 
CHD (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 
33.5-57.0).
Besides the low prenatal diagnosis 
rate for CHD, another important 
aspect is its late detection. In Belgium, 
only 14.1 % of CHD in general and 
20.5 % of severe CHD were diagnosed 
before 25 weeks of gestation.4 In 
Argentina, our group reported a series 
of 303 fetuses diagnosed prenatally, 
mostly referred from other facilities, 
where the mean gestational age at the 
time of diagnosis was 29.9 ± 5 weeks.6
Intrauterine detection depends 
on several factors, so it is critical for 
patients to have an easy access to the 
health system. Although in Argentina 
and in all Latin American countries 
this is highly relevant, it is not the only 
aspect to be taken into account because, 
as detailed above, even in countries 
with a high health care coverage, the 
overall detection of CHD does not 
exceed 50-60 %.
A second factor is sonographers’ 
expertise in the assessment of the 
fetal heart. A high proportion of CHD 
without prenatal diagnosis is seen 
in patients who underwent several 
Review

e150 / Arch Argent Pediatr 2020;118(2):e149-e161 / Review
ultrasounds that only report the fetal heart 
rate without assessing the fetal heart anatomy. 
Therefore, it is critical to develop systematic 
training and ongoing quality programs,2-5 which 
are lacking in our setting.
Thirdly, even with trained operators, the 
test may be complex in patients with specific 
characteristics, such as maternal obesity or 
pregnancy with marked polyhydramnios 
(excessive amniotic fluid).1
Lastly, some pathologies are easily diagnosed, 
while others are rarely detected (Table 1). Thus, 
the rate of prenatal detection of hypoplastic left 
heart syndrome is high and may reach up to 
approximately 90 % of cases,2-5 whereas other 
CHD, such as anomalous venous return, are 
hardly detected in the prenatal period.1,2
When and how to assess the fetal heart
The fetal heart is assessed by means of a 
routine, detailed fetal ultrasound around week 
20-24. At present, this test has been standardized 
by the International Society of Ultrasound in 
Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) and consists 
in a screening procedure including the four￾chamber view (Figure 1), ventricular outflow tract 
view (Figure 2), and three-vessel and three-vessel 
and trachea views (Figure 3).7
In addition, a fetal echocardiogram is indicated 
in patients at a higher risk for CHD compared 
to the general population (Table 2). Among 
maternal indications, one of the most prevalent 
conditions is diabetes mellitus, which entails 
a risk 2-3 times higher for malformations than 
the general population. Such increased risk is 
related to glycosylated hemoglobin values: a 
higher glycosylated hemoglobin level leads to 
a higher risk for congenital defects. In relation 
to CHD, there is a higher risk for structural 
malformation due to an altered embryogenesis, 
potentially evident in early tests,8
 and for septal 
hypertrophy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
due to hyperinsulinism, which can be evidenced 
in the third trimester.9
Other maternal conditions that increase 
the risk for heart disease include autoimmune 
diseases with positive anti-Ro and anti-La 
antibodies, such as Sjögren syndrome and 
systemic lupus erythematosus. The risk for a 
complete atrioventricular block is 1-2 % and, if a 
prior child has been affected, such risk increases 
to 15-20 %.10

In terms of infections, varicella11 and rubella12
may lead to structural heart defects, whereas 
parvovirus is associated with heart failure 
secondary to severe anemia and myocarditis.13,14
CHD may also be the result of embryonic 
exposure to a wide range of chemicals. 15 In 
relation to recreational drugs, alcohol is the most 
prevalent agent. Among commonly used drugs 
in medicine, lithium, isotretinoin, misoprostol, 
and some anticonvulsant agents, such as 
phenobarbital and valproic acid, are associated 
with CHD.16
A positive family history is also a known 
risk factor for CHD.15 The risk of recurrence 
after having an affected child is 2-5 %, but varies 
broadly depending on the type of heart disease 
and increases even more in the case of more 
than one affected child. The risks are also higher 
when one of the parents has CHD, and the risk 
of recurrence is higher if the mother is the carrier 
(10-15 %) compared to the father (2 %).15
A fetal echocardiogram may also be indicated 
due to fetal findings during pregnancy control. 
Monozygotic twin pregnancies are at a higher

risk for congenital defects than the general 
population. In particular, in the twin-to-twin 
transfusion syndrome, the recipient twin has a 
10 % chance of having right ventricular outflow 
tract anomalies.17
Some ultrasound markers in the first 
trimester, such as nuchal translucency (NT) 
thickness, and ductus venosus (DV) and 
tricuspid valve Doppler ultrasound, used to 
screen for chromosomal anomalies, have also 
demonstrated their usefulness as CHD markers. 
On its side, at present, the assessment of the 
fetal anatomy during the second trimester has 
been standardized to cover both the fetal heart 
and the fetal anatomy,7,18 and any finding from 
such baseline screening is a formal indication 
for a fetal echocardiogram. This test has also 
been recommended in case of prenatal diagnosis 
of chromosomal anomalies and microdeletion 
syndromes,15 especially in viable anomalies 
such as trisomy 21, which is strongly associated 
with the atrioventricular canal, monosomy of 
the X chromosome, associated with coarctation 
of the aorta, and microdeletion 22q11.2 or 
DiGeorge syndrome, associated with conotruncal 
anomalies. Likewise, the molecular diagnosis of a 
Mendelian pathology is an indication for a heart 
assessment by a specialist.

Is it possible to assess the fetal heart 
in the first trimester?
First trimester screening is done between 
weeks 11 and 14 of pregnancy, which started 
with the assessment of NT for the detection 
of trisomy 21 and other aneuploidies, and has 
extended for the diagnosis of several major 
malformations.19-26 An ultrasound at weeks 11-
14 may play an important role in the detection of 
CHD due to the direct visualization of the heart 
defect or the presence of ultrasound markers that 
might increase the risk.
a. Direct visualization of congenital heart 
disease
According to the ISUOG guidelines, at 
weeks 11-14, the heart assessment includes only 
recording a regular heart rate and the correct 
heart location in the left hemithorax (levocardia).27
Certain pathologies may be identified at this 
gestational age (Figure 4). Therefore, some authors 
recommend the early assessment of the fetal heart 
using the four-chamber and outflow tract views, 
which may be obtained after week 12 in most 
cases.19 Other views are, however, more difficult 
to obtain (Table 3). McAuliffe et al. reported that, 
at 13+5 weeks, the aortic and ductal arches could 
only be seen in 45 % of cases and pulmonary 
veins, in 16 % of studied fetuses.22
Lastly, it is worth considering that an “early 
fetal echocardiogram” has a high false negative 
rate and also a high false positive rate because, 
among other factors, certain heart structures may 
not be fully developed yet.19 Therefore, caution is 
required when providing counseling because a 
significant proportion of tests showing abnormal 
findings will finally result in a healthy heart.
b. Risk markers of congenital heart disease 
in the first trimester
The first-trimester ultrasound markers 
associated with CHD are increased NT, a 
pathological DV, and tricuspid regurgitation 
(Figure 5).
1. Increased nuchal translucency
The main ultrasound marker of risk for 
CHD in the ultrasound at 11-14 weeks is an 
increased NT.19 As observed in Figure 6, the 
risk for CHD increases as the NT increases.28
Sotiriadis et al.23 performed a systematic 
Mitral atresia, 12 weeks Tricuspid atresia, 11+5 weeks

In diastole, blood flow through the

but not through the mitral valve.
In systole, anterograde blood flow in 
the ductal arch (blue) and retrograde 
flow in the aortic arch (red) are observed.

it was normal (Figure 7).
3. Tricuspid regurgitation
Pereira et al.,26 analyzed the contribution of 
tricuspid regurgitation at the time of diagnosis in 
the first trimester for CHD. Out of almost 41 000 
patients, tricuspid insufficiency was observed 
in 32.9 % of fetuses with CHD and in 1.3 % of 
fetuses without CHD, and concluded that its use 
increased the diagnosis of CHD compared to the 
use of the NT alone. In addition, they reported 
that the rate of detection of CHD, considering 
any of the 3 markers, was 57.6 % (95 % CI: 47-
67.6) (Figure 8).

Management algorithm in case of prenatal 
diagnosis of a congenital heart disease
If a CHD is suspected in the prenatal period, 
an attempt should be made to establish its 
characteristics and determine if it is isolated or 
associated with other condition, either other 
malformation and/or a genetic disorder. In 
this case, the steps to follow include a detailed 
fetal echocardiogram, a detailed morphological 
ultrasound, and a genetic assessment.
• Detailed fetal echocardiogram: It is performed 
by an expert in the prenatal diagnosis of 
heart disease for the purpose of establishing 
its characteristics. This test may include the 
assessment of the fetal thymus because a large 
number of fetuses with DiGeorge syndrome 
have thymic hypoplasia or thymus absence. 
Therefore, different methods for the prenatal 
assessment were proposed, including the 
thymic-thoracic ratio,29 which consists in 
assessing such ratio in a cross-sectional view of 
the chest, for the distance between the spine and 
the sternum and the distance between the aorta 
and the sternum (Figure 9). Results showed that 
the mean value was 0.44 ± 0.04 in normal fetuses 
and 0.25 ± 0.09 in fetuses with 22q11 deletion 
(p < 0.001). However, other groups questioned 
the usefulness of this ratio because the thymic￾thoracic ratio was smaller than in controls, not 
only in fetuses with 22q11 deletion, but also in 
those with conotruncal anomalies without 22q11 
deletion, so they concluded that results should 
be interpreted with caution.30
• A detailed morphological ultrasound is done 
because approximately 25-45 % of fetuses with 
CHD have associated extracardiac anomalies, 
especially atrioventricular canal, tetralogy of 
Fallot, and abnormal heart position.
• Genetic assessment: CHD behaves as a 
risk marker of genetic anomalies. Typical 
examples include atrioventricular canal and 
its strong association with trisomy 21 or 
conotruncal heart defects, which increase the 
risk for DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion 
syndrome). Any genetic test that may be 
done requires invasive procedures, such as 
chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. 
Maternal risks, such as abdominal wall 
hematoma or infection, are very low. In 
relation to pregnancy loss, traditionally it was 
estimated that these procedures increased the 
risk by 1 %, but a recent systematic review31
showed that risks were smaller:
1.Amniocentesis: 0.11 % (95 % CI: -0.04-0.26).
2.Chorionic villus sampling: 0.22 % (95 % 
CI: -0.71-1.16).
Once the specimen is obtained, the material 
may be assessed for chromosomal anomalies, 
microdeletion syndromes, and Mendelian 
disorders. The diagnostic performance will 
depend on the type of test available.

k a r y o t y p i n g m a y d e t e c t n u m e r i c a l 
chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 
21, and structural chromosomal abnormalities, 
like unbalanced translocations. The frequency 
of chromosomal abnormalities will depend on 
the type of diagnosed CHD.
• Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH): This 
technique allows to determine the presence of 
aneuploidies and microdeletions/duplications, 
e.g., a 22q11 deletion in a conotruncal heart 
disease.
• Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain 
reaction (QF-PCR): It allows to make a fast 
diagnosis (24-48 h) of the most common 
aneuploidies, such as trisomy 21, 18, 13, and 
sex chromosome anomalies.
• Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA): 
A cytogenetic or chromosomal array (or 
microarray) is a molecular technique that 
allows to assess deletions or duplications 
in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) regions. Its 
resolution is 100 times higher than that of 
karyotyping, so it is useful to diagnose not 
only aneuploidies and large chromosomal 
abnormalities that can be detected with 
the traditional technique, but also other 
submicroscopic anomalies that are too 
small to be detected by karyotyping.24,25
Different studies have demonstrated that 
using microarrays in the presence of a CHD 
improved the detection of genetic anomalies 
between 7 and 12 %.32-34 The limitation of this 
test is its high cost.
• Whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome 
sequencing: Although this test is still being 
investigated in the prenatal period, some 
pharmaceutical companies now offer it in 
certain clinical situations where a genetic 
anomaly is suspected after a negative array 
test.
Obstetric follow-up
Once the diagnostic evaluation is completed, 
which ideally characterized CHD, the next step is 
to establish if it is isolated or associated with other 
condition and the family receives counseling 
on the meaning of the different findings. The 
usual obstetric follow-up of maternal health 
should be provided (lab controls, blood pressure, 
etc.) together with the specialized follow-up of 
fetal health in order to reach a term pregnancy 
and prevent prematurity and its neonatal 
complications.
The type of delivery should be based on 
the obstetrician’s judgment. In general, CHD is 
not a contraindication for a vaginal delivery. A 
newborn with a CHD should be delivered by 
a trained neonatal team at a neonatology unit 
capable of providing cardiovascular assessment 
and management.
Fetal therapy in heart anomalies
a. Fetal cardiac interventions
Prenatal interventions that are under 
investigation and should therefore not 
be considered a standard of care include 
v a l v u l o p l a s t y , s t e n t p l a c e m e n t , a n d 
pericardiocentesis. These procedures do not 
imply a significant risk for the mother,35 but 
for the fetus, with a fetal mortality rate of 11 % 
as reported by the International Fetal Cardiac 
Intervention Registry (http://www.ifcir.org).
Fetal critical aortic stenosis may lead to 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).36-39
The purpose of fetal aortic valvuloplasty is to 
unblock the ventricular outflow tract in order to 
improve ventricular function and allow left heart 
structures to develop (Figure 10). Fetal pulmonary 
valvuloplasty in critical pulmonary stenosis39,40
may potentially prevent progression to a single 
ventricle physiology due to severe hypoplasia of 
the right ventricle.
Severe oval foramen restriction41 in patients 
with HLHS leads to an increased pressure 
on the left atrium, with passive pulmonary 
vascular congestion and the development of 
lymphangiectasia and pulmonary vascular 
remodeling. These patients make up a sub-group 
with a high early neonatal mortality given that, 
at birth, they require an emergency balloon 
atrial septostomy (Rashkind intervention). Stent 
placement in the interatrial septum in the fetal 
period is feasible and may allow to reduce 
neonatal mortality and prevent the progression 
of the pulmonary vascular damage (Figure 11).
Severe pericardial effusion42 may lead to death 
due to cardiac tamponade. In some cases, serial 
pericardiocenteses (Figure 12) or a pericardio￾amniotic shunt placement are required.
b. Therapy for arrhythmias
These are uncommon but potentially severe.

M o s t a r e r e p r e s e n t e d b y r e e n t r a n t 
supraventricular tachycardia and atrial flutter, 
and are diagnosed when the fetal heart rate is 

e158 / Arch Argent Pediatr 2020;118(2):e149-e161 / Review
above 180-190 beats per minute.43-48 In general, 
the strategy with a greater chance for survival 
encompasses an attempt to reverse arrhythmia 
in utero; to this end, since this procedure may 
be very difficult, it is important to follow strict 
management protocols. The most commonly 
used antiarrhythmic agents include digoxin, 
flecainide, and sotalol and, to a lesser extent, 
amiodarone, and they may be used alone or in 
combination (especially in the case of fetuses 
with hydrops). A strict cardiac assessment 
and control of the mother is critical because 
all antiarrhythmic agents are potentially 
arrhythmogenic. The case of an intrauterine 
pacemaker placed in a fetus with refractory 
hydrops has been published recently,49 but 
this procedure is still in the early phases of 
investigation.

II. Fetal bradyarrhythmias
These are defined by a heart rate persistently 
below 100-110 beats per minute. Fetal 
bradyarrhythmias may occur in fetuses with 
structural heart disease or without an evident 
anomaly. In those without a structural heart 
disease, it is necessary to establish maternal 
levels of anti-Ro (anti-SSA) and anti-La (anti￾SSB) antibodies which, due to transplacental 
transfer, may result in conduction system 
damage and myocardial function involvement 
caused by the development of fibroelastosis, 
so the risk for complete atrioventricular block 
is 1-2 % in those without family history and 
15-20 % in those with a prior affected child.10
Potential benefits have been described with 
the administration of corticosteroids to the 
mother, associated or not with sympathomimetic 
drugs, in case of prolonged mechanical PR 
interval (first- or second-degree block) or in the 
presence of fibroelastosis,50 but data are limited.50
FINAL COMMENT
In spite of the importance of prenatal diagnosis 
of CHD, the rate of detection is still low in the 
general population. This reflects the limitations of 
prenatal diagnosis and warrants any effort made 
to improve knowledge in this area for the purpose 
of enhancing perinatal outcomes in children with 
CHD. n
