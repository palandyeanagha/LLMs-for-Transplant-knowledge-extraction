Abstract
When oxygen becomes limiting, cells reduce mitochondrial respiration and increase ATP production through anaerobic
fermentation of glucose. The Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs) play a key role in this metabolic shift by regulating the
transcription of key enzymes of glucose metabolism. Here we show that oxygen regulates the expression of the muscle
glycogen synthase (GYS1). Hypoxic GYS1 induction requires HIF activity and a Hypoxia Response Element within its
promoter. GYS1 gene induction correlated with a significant increase in glycogen synthase activity and glycogen
accumulation in cells exposed to hypoxia. Significantly, knockdown of either HIF1a or GYS1 attenuated hypoxia-induced
glycogen accumulation, while GYS1 overexpression was sufficient to mimic this effect. Altogether, these results indicate that
GYS1 regulation by HIF plays a central role in the hypoxic accumulation of glycogen. Importantly, we found that hypoxia
also upregulates the expression of UTP:glucose-1-phosphate urydylyltransferase (UGP2) and 1,4-a glucan branching enzyme
(GBE1), two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of glycogen. Therefore, hypoxia regulates almost all the enzymes involved
in glycogen metabolism in a coordinated fashion, leading to its accumulation. Finally, we demonstrated that abrogation of
glycogen synthesis, by knock-down of GYS1 expression, impairs hypoxic preconditioning, suggesting a physiological role for
the glycogen accumulated during chronic hypoxia. In summary, our results uncover a novel effect of hypoxia on glucose
metabolism, further supporting the central importance of metabolic reprogramming in the cellular adaptation to hypoxia.

Introduction
Aerobic glycolysis yields sixteen times more ATP than glucose
fermentation. Thus, metazoans are heavily dependent on the
highly energy-efficient aerobic metabolism to meet their large
ATP demands. Since oxygen is the final electron acceptor during
mitochondrial respiration, this element is essential for metazoan
metabolism. In fact, most of the oxygen consumed by animals is
required to sustain oxidative phosphorylation. However, several
animal species are able to adapt to reduced oxygen tensions during
variable periods of time [1]. These include diving animals,
fossorial mammals, animals living at high altitude and species of
fish that live in stagnant waters, among others [1]. In nearly all
these cases, the adaptation to hypoxia involves systemic and
cellular responses aimed to reduce oxygen consumption and
optimize its utilization.
At the cellular level, the reduction in oxygen consumption is
mediated by a shift from oxidative to fermentative glucose
metabolism [2,3,4,5], the fine-tuning of mitochondrial respiration
[6] and an adjustment of mitochondria number. This hypometa￾bolic state is achieved by the induction of a specific gene
expression program under the control of the Hypoxia-Inducible
Factor (HIF) family of transcription factors. This family comprises
three transcription factors (HIF-1, HIF-2 and HIF-3) that are
heterodimers of a constitutively expressed b subunit and an
oxygen-sensitive a subunit (HIF1a, HIF2a or HIF3a) [7,8,9]. In
the presence of oxygen, HIFa is extremely unstable due to an
oxygen-dependent posttranslational hydroxylation that targets it
for proteosomal degradation [10,11,12,13,14]. A family of prolyl
hydroxilases (EGLNs), that require molecular oxygen as a reaction
cosubstrate, catalyzes the hydroxylation of HIFa [15,16,17].
Hence, under hypoxia, hydroxylation is compromised leading to

HIF stabilization and, subsequently, to its binding the hypoxia￾response element (RCGTG motif) on the regulatory region of
target genes [18]. Among these genes are those of glucose
transporter SLC2A1 (Glut1) and almost all glycolytic enzymes [2],
whose induction leads to an increased glycolytic flux. In addition,
hypoxia regulates the end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, which is
actively diverted from mitochondrial oxidation due to the HIF￾mediated induction of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinases (PDK1
and PDK4) [3,4,19]. Finally, HIF also induces the transcription of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [20] and lactate transporter (MCT4)
[21], whose activities account for the transformation of pyruvate
into lactate and its export out of the cell, respectively. Overall, the
coordinated induction of all these genes by HIF decreases glucose
oxidation, contributing to reduced oxygen consumption, and
increases anaerobic ATP production to maintain energy balance.
Thus, the adaptation to hypoxia is critically dependent on the
reprogramming of glucose metabolism and, accordingly, a large
number of HIF-target genes function in coordination to promote
this metabolic shift. Importantly, because of all these metabolic
adaptations, hypoxic cells rely heavily on an appropriate glucose
supply. To ensure glucose availability, cells that depend on
anaerobic glycolysis to sustain ATP production, such as skeletal
myotubes, accumulate large amounts of glucose in the form of
glycogen. In agreement, some reports described an increase in
glycogen upon exposure of cells to hypoxia [22,23] or hypoxia￾mimetics [24]. However, in spite of these pieces of evidence, the
effect of hypoxia on glycogen metabolism and the molecular
mechanism involved are yet to be addressed.
Herein we demonstrate that hypoxia leads to glycogen
accumulation through the coordinated regulation of glycogen
biosynthesis. We show that GYS1 is a novel hypoxia-inducible,
HIF-dependent gene, whose induction mediates glycogen accu￾mulation following oxygen deprivation. Consequently, this work
reveals a novel metabolic response to low oxygen and emphasizes
the relevance of glucose metabolism in the adaptation to hypoxia.
Furthermore, we found that GYS1 interference abrogates hypoxic
preconditioning in an in vitro model of ischemia. We hence propose
that the HIF-dependent increase in glycogen stores is a hypoxia￾triggered adaptation that prepares cells to cope with further
oxygen restrictions by ensuring adequate substrate supply for
anaerobic glycolysis.
Results
Hypoxia induces GYS1 expression in a HIF-dependent
manner
With the aim of understanding the whole array of metabolic
adaptations that cells employ to cope with reduced oxygen tension,
we searched the human genome for the occurrence of potential
hypoxia-response elements (HREs). This search was based on the
evolutionary conservation of HREs and their similitude to known
functional HRE-containing regulatory regions [25]. The details of
the strategy were reported elsewhere (Ortiz et al. Nucl. Acids Res.
in press). One of the potential HREs identified by this approach was
located in the promoter of the muscle isoform of glycogen
synthase, GYS1. To investigate the potential regulation of GYS1
by hypoxia, we exposed c2c12 skeletal muscle myotubes to 1%
oxygen and determined the level of GYS1 mRNA by quantitative
PCR. Figure 1A shows that GYS1 mRNA was strongly induced by
hypoxia in c2c12 cells. In contrast, hypoxia did not alter the
mRNA levels of the closely related GYS2 (liver glycogen synthase)
enzyme (figure 1A). In agreement, we did not find evolutionarily
conserved HREs in the GYS2 locus. The hypoxic induction of
GYS1 was not restricted to differentiated skeletal muscle cells, but
was also observed in myoblast as well as other primary and stable
cell lines (Figure S1 and data not shown). It is noteworthy that
hypoxia also led to GYS1 induction in the hepatoma cell lines
HepG2 (data not shown) and HepaC1 (see below), as well as in
primary hepatocytes (figure 1B). The induction of GYS1 mRNA
was inhibited by actinomycin D treatment (figure 1C), suggesting
that hypoxia affected its transcription rather than its stability.
Altogether, these results indicated that GYS1 was a hypoxia￾inducible gene, and strongly hinted that it was also a HIF-target
gene. In agreement, treatment of c2c12 cells with a siRNA
targeting HIF1a (figure 2A and 2B) reduced GYS1 induction by
hypoxia (figure 2B and C). The partial induction of GYS1 by
hypoxia observed in HIF1a knock down cells could be explained
by the remaining HIF1a expression and/or the contribution of
HIF2a to GYS1 regulation. To corroborate the implication of
HIF in this process, we investigated the effect of hypoxia on GYS1
expression in the HepaC4 HIF-deficient cells (figure 2D). These
cells contain a mutant HIFb subunit with a severely reduced half
life and, as a consequence, they are deficient in HIF activity
Figure 1. GYS1, but not GYS2, is a hypoxia-regulated HIF target gene. c2c12 myotubes (A) or primary mouse hepatocytes (B) were exposed
to normoxia or hypoxia for 12 hours and the level of GYS1 and GYS2 mRNA was determined by quantitative PCR. The amount of each mRNA in
samples was normalized to the content of b-actin mRNA in the same sample. The graph represents the fold values of hypoxic over normoxic mRNA
levels normalized to the value of 1 (horizontal line). Data shown are the results of three independent experiments and their mean. (C) c2c12 cells were

[26,27]. As shown in figure 2D, while hypoxia induced glycogen
synthase accumulation in the parental HIF-competent HepaC1
cells, this effect was completely blunted in the HepaC4 cells
(figure 2D). Taken together, these results identify GYS1 as a novel
HIF-target gene upregulated by hypoxia.
GYS1 promoter region contains a functional HRE
The HRE identified by our bioinformatic search (Ortiz et al.
Nucl. Acids Res. in press) was located at position -314 in the
promoter region of human GYS1 (figure 3A). This site matched
the canonical ACGTG motif and was conserved across mammals
(figure 3A). Moreover, the HRE motif was included in a non￾coding region conserved across vertebrates (figure 3A, PhastCons
vertebrate track) [28]. Importantly, HIF1a associated with the
genomic region containing this HRE motif upon exposure of
c2c12 cells to hypoxia (Figure 3B), suggesting that, in intact cells,
HIF binds this site. To test the functionality of this HRE, we
cloned the region from -211 to -429 upstream a minimal promoter
driving the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. As
shown in figure 3C, hypoxia and the EGLN inhibitor DMOG
strongly induced luciferase activity in cells transfected with the
construct containing the potential HRE regardless of its orienta￾tion. Importantly, mutation of the HRE motif completely impaired
the induction of this construct by hypoxia (figure 3C). Next, we
tested whether this element was able to confer hypoxia-inducibility
to the native GYS1 promoter. To this end, we cloned the whole
promoter region of the human GYS1 gene including the HRE
(+128 to –429) into the pGL3-basic plasmid. This genomic region
showed promoter activity since it drove luciferase expression above
pGL3 basal levels (figure 3D). Significantly, the promoter activity
of this construct was robustly induced by hypoxia and DMOG
(figure 3D). In addition, the induction by Hypoxia and DMOG,
but not the basal promoter activity, was lost when the reporter
construct included a mutation in the HRE motif (figure 3D). In
summary, GYS1 contains an evolutionarily conserved HRE
located at -314 that mediates its induction by hypoxia.
Hypoxia-mediated induction of GYS1 results in increased
glycogen synthase activity
The experiments described above demonstrated that hypoxia
induced GYS1 transcription in a HIF-dependent manner.

Importantly, gene transcription correlates with an increment of
muscle glycogen synthase protein (figure 2B and 4A). Since
glycogen synthase (from now on GS) activity is subjected to a
complex regulation by allosteric modulators and phosphorylation
by several kinases, protein levels do not necessarily correlate with
activity. Therefore, we next asked whether the increment in
GYS1 protein resulted in augmented GS activity. Figure 4B
shows that GS activity increased in parallel with protein
accumulation (figure 4A). Importantly, in the presence of the
allosteric activator glucose-6-phosphate, that drives conversion of
GS to its fully active state, samples from hypoxic cells still
displayed increased GS activity as compared to control samples
(figure 4C). Thus, hypoxia increased the total amount of GS but
did not alter the proportion of active/inactive conformations as
shown by the I/T ratio (figure 4D). In agreement, hypoxia did
not modify the fraction of phosphorylated GYS1 (figure 4A).
These results strongly suggest that GYS1 induction by HIF leads
to augmented GS activity.

Hypoxia induces glycogen accumulation
In order to test the functional relevance of increased GS activity,
we exposed c2c12 myotubes to hypoxia (1% oxygen) or normoxia
(21% oxygen) and determined their glycogen content at different
time points. As shown in figure 5A, hypoxia resulted in a
significant increase in glycogen concentration. Significantly, as
noted for GYS1 gene induction (figure 1), glycogen accumulation
was not restricted to muscle cells as it was also observed in liver￾derived cells (figure 5B). Collectively, these results indicate that the
hypoxic induction of GYS1 correlates with a significant increase in
glycogen reserves.
Hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation is
HIF-dependent
As discussed before, HIF mediates most of the metabolic
adaptations to hypoxia. Therefore, we next investigated the role of
this transcription factor in glycogen accumulation. As shown in
figure 6A, reduction of HIF activity by siRNA treatment
attenuated the hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation. In
addition, the use of HepaC1/C4 cells provided further evidence
of the role of HIF on the hypoxic accumulation of glycogen. While
hypoxia induced glycogen accumulation in the HIF-competent
HepaC1 cells, this effect was abrogated in the HIF-deficient
HepaC4 cells (figure 6B). These results demonstrate that HIF is
necessary for the accumulation of glycogen induced by hypoxia.
GYS1 mediates the hypoxic accumulation of glycogen
The results presented above demonstrate that hypoxia results in
an increase in GYS1 expression and total glycogen synthase
activity that correlates with glycogen accumulation. In order to
establish a functional link between these phenomena, we
investigated the effect of GYS1 interference on hypoxia-induced
glycogen accumulation. Treatment of c2c12 with siRNA against
GYS1 resulted in a reduction of both GYS1 mRNA and protein
(figures 7A and 7B) that negatively affected glycogen accumulation
induced by hypoxia as compared to control cells transfected with
scramble siRNA (figure 7C). Since GS activity is an absolute
requirement for glycogen synthesis, we next investigated the effect
of knocking down GYS1 in the hepatoma HepaC1 cells, which
also express the liver isoform GYS2. To this end, we infected
HepaC1 cells with a retrovirus encoding for a short hairpin RNA
directed to GYS1 (shGYS1) or an irrelevant shRNA (control), and
selected pools of cells that stably integrated the construct.
Expression of shGYS1 reduced GYS1 mRNA expression to
1267.7% of control cells expressing a control shRNA (figure 7D)
without affecting GYS2 expression (GYS2 mRNA level was

67616% of that in control cells). In agreement with the
experiments in c2c12 cells, knockdown of GYS1 prevented the
hypoxia-induced accumulation of glycogen (figure 7E). Finally, we
asked whether GYS1 induction was sufficient to promote glycogen
accumulation. To this end, we determined the glycogen content of
c2c12 cells infected with an adenovirus encoding for GYS1. As
shown in figure 7F, forced expression of GYS1 led to the
accumulation of glycogen to levels similar as those obtained under
hypoxia. Altogether, these experiments indicate that GYS1
induction by HIF could explain the accumulation of glycogen
observed under hypoxia.
Hypoxia regulates glycogen metabolism at multiple
levels to promote glycogen accumulation
The effect of hypoxia on glucose catabolism is mediated through
the induction of almost all the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway
in a coordinated fashion. Thus, we next investigated whether
hypoxia modulated other enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis.
In fact, in addition to GYS1, our bioinformatics strategy (Ortiz et
al. Nucl. Acids Res. in press) also identified UGP2 and GBE1 as
potential HIF targets. Specifically we found two potential HREs in
the UGP2 locus (located at positions -72 and +793, within the
promoter region and first intron respectively) and one in the GBE1
locus (located within the first intron 8746 bp downstream of the
transcription start site). UGP2 encodes for UTP:glucose-1-
phosphate uridylyltransferase, an enzyme that synthesizes UDP￾glucose, the substrate used by GS for glycogen synthesis. GBE1
encodes for 1,4-a glucan branching enzyme, the activity
responsible for the generation of the highly ramified structure of
glycogen. To investigate whether these genes were induced by
hypoxia, we exposed c2c12 myoblasts and primary hepatocytes to
1% oxygen and determined the level of their mRNA by
quantitative PCR. As shown in figure 8A, GBE1 mRNA, but
not UGP2 mRNA, was strongly induced in c2c12 cells. In

agreement with our data, a recent work demonstrated that GBE1
is induced by nickel treatment in a HIF-dependent manner [29].
On the other hand, UGP2 mRNA was upregulated by hypoxia in
hepatocytes while GBE1 remained unaffected (figure 8A). The
dissimilar behaviour of these genes in each cell type is probably a
consequence of metabolic differences between muscle and liver.
These differences notwithstanding, our results demonstrate that
hypoxia induces the expression of all the enzymes required for
glycogen synthesis. Finally, we also investigated whether, in
addition to increased synthesis, a reduction of glycogen degrada￾tion could contribute to the accumulation of glycogen observed
during hypoxia. In agreement with this possibility, we found a
modest reduction of glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activity in cells
exposed to hypoxia (figure 8B). In addition, this effect was
observed even when the activity was assayed in the presence of the
allosteric modulators caffeine and AMP that inhibit and activate
GP, respectively (figure 8B). The effect of hypoxia on GP activity
was reproducible and similar in magnitude to that induced by
caffeine and AMP, but differences did not reach statistical
significance. Importantly, and in sharp contrast with the GS
activity data, the reduction in GP activity did not correlate with
altered gene expression, since none of the PYG isoforms encoding
for glycogen phosphorylase were affected by hypoxia (figure 8C).
Altogether, these results indicate that hypoxia leads to glycogen
accumulation by affecting different reactions involved in its
metabolism.
Hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation promotes cell
survival
Cellular responses to hypoxia promote adaptation to low
oxygen so that cells and tissues are better equipped to confront
future oxygen restrictions. Therefore, we speculated that
glycogen accumulation could contribute to the cellular adapta￾tion to hypoxia by ensuring glucose supply for anaerobic
glycolysis. To test this possibility, we first investigated the effect
of hypoxia pre-treatment on the survival of cells deprived of

glucose and exposed to severe hypoxia. As shown in figure 9A,
HepaC1 cells die within 12 hours after exposure to anoxia in
the absence of glucose (NxRAx). Importantly, exposure of cells
to hypoxia (1% oxygen for 24 h), prior to the anoxic treatment
in the absence of glucose (HxRAx), resulted in increased
survival (figure 9A). Thus, in this experimental setting, hypoxia
triggers a response that improves cell survival upon subsequent
hypoxic challenges (hypoxic preconditioning). Moreover, as
observed in other systems, hypoxic preconditioning was
dependent on HIF activity since it was not observed in HIF
deficient HepaC4 cells (figure 9A). Next, we asked whether
glycogen accumulation could be part of the HIF-dependent
responses that mediate this preconditioning. To answer this
question, we prevented hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation
in HepaC1 cells by expression of a short-hairpin RNA against
GYS1, shGYS1 (figure 7D and E) and determined cell viability
after exposure to anoxia in the absence of glucose. In agreement
with a role for GYS1 and glycogen accumulation in hypoxic
preconditioning, GYS1 repression resulted in decreased viability
(figure 9B). Thus, these results suggest that glycogen accumu￾lation plays a role in the adaptive response to hypoxia.
Discussion
The data presented herein demonstrates that GYS1 is a novel
hypoxia-inducible gene. The induction of GYS1 by hypoxia
requires HIF-activity and an HRE motif located on GYS1
promoter. Consequently, GYS1 should be included among the
growing cohort of HIF-target genes involved in glucose metabo￾lism. In this regard, it is interesting to note that, similar to other
HIF-regulated glycolytic genes [30], GYS1 promoter is induced by
the HIF1a, but not the HIF2a isoform (Figure S2).
Importantly, the induction of GYS1 by HIF results in increased
total GS activity during hypoxia without altering the I/T ratio.
Thus, our results indicate that the increased GS activity is a
consequence of the incremented amount of enzyme, rather than of
a shift in its activation state. This result is significant since it
underlines the importance of GS transcription in the regulation of
glycogen synthesis, as opposed to the well-characterized posttrans￾lational modifications of GS in response to hormones and
metabolites. In addition, the effect of hypoxia is highly specific,
as it affects GYS1, but not GYS2, gene transcription. To our
knowledge, this is the first report of transcriptional regulation of
GYS1 in response to environmental cues and the first report
demonstrating the regulation of glycogen synthesis at the gene
expression level. Moreover, recent findings demonstrate that the
blockage of GYS1 degradation, caused by laforin or malin
mutations, leads to increased glycogen levels in myoclonus epilepsy
[31]. Hence, alteration of GS level by modifications of its
transcription and/or degradation rate constitutes a novel form of
regulation of the glycogen metabolism.
Importantly, we found that, in addition to GYS1, hypoxia also
induced the expression of UGP2 and GBE1, genes that encode for
the rest of the enzymatic activities required for glycogen synthesis.
The regulation of GBE1 was previously described [29], but, to our
knowledge, this is the first report suggesting UGP2 regulation by
hypoxia. In agreement with our results, analysis of public gene
expression datasets (Gene Expression Omnibus at NCBI, http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) reveals upregulation of UGP2 and GBE1
in several cell types exposed to hypoxia (Ortiz et al. Nucl. Acids
Res. in press). Further work is required to address the role of HIF in
their induction by hypoxia and to determine the functionality of
the identified HREs. In spite of the central role of GS as the rate
limiting step in glycogen accumulation, the induction of these
Figure 9. GYS1 contributes to hypoxic preconditioning. Hepa C1 and Hepa C4 cells (A) or Hepa C1 cells stably expressing a shRNA directed to
GYS1 or a control shRNA (B) were exposed to 21% (Nx-.Ax) or 1% (Hx-.Ax) for 24 hours in complete media and then cultured in a glucose-free
serum-free media and anoxia for 12 additional hours. Cell viability was determined as indicated in Materials and Methods. The results from four
independent experiments and their mean are shown.

other genes surely contributes to an increased flow through this
biosynthetic pathway. Additional experiments would be needed to
address the relative contribution of these enzymes to hypoxic
glycogen accumulation. On the other hand, our data suggest that
hypoxia does not only regulate glycogen synthesis but also
represses its degradation. This finding is in agreement with
previous observations suggesting dowregulation of GP activity
during prolonged hypoxia [23]. Interestingly, the reduction in GP
activity was not accompanied by decreased expression of the genes
coding for the enzymes bearing this activity. However, GP activity
from hypoxic cells was reduced even in the presence of the
allosteric activator AMP, suggesting lower protein levels. In
agreement with this possibility, preliminary experiments show a
reduction in protein levels of the muscle isoform of GP in hypoxic
c2c12 cells (data not shown). Thus it is plausible that hypoxia
affects GP translation rate and/or protein stability.
Collectively, these results indicate that hypoxia induces a
coordinated response that affects glycogen metabolism at multiple
levels, in a similar fashion to the paradigmatic hypoxic regulation of
glycolisis. Finally, we cannot rule out that other hypoxia-triggered
pathways play a role in the accumulation of glycogen. In this regard,
it is likely that the upregulation of the glucose transporter SLC2A1
(Glut-1) by HIF contributes to the accumulation of glycogen by
increasing the intracellular concentration of glucose.
Since anaerobic glycolysis is characterized by increased glucose
demand, the induction of glycogen synthesis during hypoxia might
seem paradoxical. However, as the induction of glycogen synthesis
requires HIF-dependent gene expression, it will be effective during
chronic hypoxia and/or subsequent hypoxic episodes. Therefore,
the induction of glycogen synthesis during prolonged hypoxia
might serve to replenish glycogen stores that could have been
mobilized during early acute hypoxia. In agreement, it was
previously proposed [22,23] that muscle glycogen supercompensa￾tion, the accumulation of glycogen above basal levels observed
after depletion of reserves during intense muscle exercise, was a
consequence of the hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation.
Additionally, the induction of glycogen synthesis during chronic
hypoxia results in larger cellular reserves. Our cell viability results
suggest that hypoxic glycogen accumulation moderately improves
cell survival following a hypoxic/isquemic insult. It should be
noted however, that our assay could reflect a higher metabolic rate
rather than enhanced viability. At any rate, this result implies that
hypoxia-exposed cells are better equipped to respond to
subsequent hypoxic challenges due to, at least in part, their higher
glycogen content. In accord, hypoxia tolerant animals present
large glycogen stores that are critical to ensure glucose supply
during oxygen restriction [1]. Thus, we propose that the induction
of GYS1 by HIF constitutes a cellular response involved in long￾term adaptation to hypoxia that prepare cells to better cope with
future oxygen restrictions.
Understanding the molecular mechanism of this novel response
could be beneficial, not only in elucidating the physiology of the
adaptations to hypoxia, but also in rationally designing novel
therapeutic strategies to treat pathologies that course with hypoxia.
In this regard, excessive accumulation of glycogen causes several
pathologies that affect heart and central nervous system physiol￾ogy. Hence, it is possible that GYS1 induction, while being an
adaptive response that protects cells, could lead to an excessive
glycogen accumulation in heart or brain that could contribute to
damage in these organs following ischemic insults. In agreement
with this possibility, it has been recently reported that chronic
intermittent hypoxia leads to liver injury due, at least in part, to
glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes [32]. On the other hand,
our results showing that hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation
protects cells from subsequent ischemia could be relevant to tumor
biology. As a consequence of aberrant vasculature, tumors are
exposed to intermittent hypoxia that could induce glycogen
accumulation. If this response is present, it could contribute to the
resistance to fluctuations in blood supply that is commonly
observed in tumors. Further work is required to test this hypothesis
and to investigate the potential role of GYS1 as a target for
therapeutic intervention in cancer.
In summary, the results presented herein reveal a novel
metabolic adaptation of cells to function under reduced oxygen
tensions. Our results further emphasize the central role of the
metabolic adaptation in the response to hypoxia and the
anticipatory nature of this response, as it seeks to prevent or
reduce the effects of a more severe hypoxia.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Reagents— c2c12 myoblasts were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. To induce myogenic differentiation
(c2c12 myotubes), cells were allowed to reach confluence and were
then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum.
Neonatal hepatocytes were kindly provided by Angela Martı´nez
Valverde (IIB, Madrid). HepaC1 and HepaC4 cells were
maintained in a-modifed Eagle’s medium (Biochrom) supplement￾ed with 10% fetal bovine serum. In all cases, culture medium was
supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37uC and 5% CO2 in a
humidified incubator. For hypoxia treatments, cells were grown at
37uC in sealed chambers (Billups-Rothenberg) flushed with a 1%
O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 gas mixture or in a Whitley hypoxystation
(don Whitley Scientific, UK) set at the indicated oxygen
concentration. Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG, Frontier Scientif￾ic, CA,USA) was added to the indicated cultures at a 250 mM final
concentration.
Plasmid Construction- Human genomic DNA extracted from
human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells was used as template for
PCR amplification of GYS1 promoter regions. PCR products
were first cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (invitrogen) and subse￾quently subcloned for reporter assays into the KpnI/XhoI
restriction sites of pGL3-Basic (Invitrogen) or the BamHI site of
prolactin- plasmid [33], in both possible orientations. The identity
of all constructs was verified by sequencing. Primer sequences are
available from the authors upon request.
Reporter assays- Reporter assays were performed using the human
cervical-carcinoma cell line HeLa. Cells were seeded on six-well
plates (3.5*104 cells/well) 6 h prior to transfection. A 9 mg DNA
mixture containing 3 mg of the indicated reporter construct or
empty plasmid and 0.1 mg of a plasmid encoding for Renilla (sea
pansy) luciferase under the control of a null promoter (Promega,
Madison, WI, U.S.A.) was used for transfection using the calcium
phosphate method. 16 h after transfection, cells where washed,
replated in 24-well plates, and incubated in normoxia, in the
presence of DMOG or in hypoxia for an additional 16 hours.
After treatments cells were lysed and the firefly and Renilla
luciferase activities of the lysate were determined using a dual￾luciferase system (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.). The firefly
luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase.
Treatment with Recombinant Adenoviruses— AdCMV-GFP-MGS
and AdCMV-galactosidase were described previously [34]. For
infections cells were incubated for 2 h with an appropriate amount
of adenovirus in OptiMEM. Infection medium was then replaced
with DMEM, and cells were incubated for 48 h at 37uC in a
humidified incubator.
Induction of GYS1 by Hypoxia

RNA interference- We used the following commercial siRNAs:
HIF1alpha siRNA (Santa Cruz, predesigned siRNA#16708),
GYS1 siRNA (Qiagen, SI01060843), and All Stars siRNA
(Qiagen, catalog # 1027281) as a negative control. A concentra￾tion of 30 nM of each siRNA was transfected into c2c12 cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The efficiency of HIF1alpha or GYS1 knockdown
was determined by real time quantitative PCR analysis. Stable
attenuation of GYS1 expression was achieved by selection of
pooled cells infected with lentivirus expressing a short hairpin
RNA directed to mouse GYS1. The lentiviral constructs were a
kind gift from Carles Martinez-Pons (IRB, Barcelona).
Metabolite determinations- Glycogen determination was performed
as previously described [35]. Briefly, cells were scraped with 30%
(w/v) KOH; the extract was then boiled for 15 min and the
resulting solution was spotted on chromatography paper 31 ET
(Whatman). Glycogen was precipitated by immersing the papers in
ice-cold 66% (v/v) ethanol. After two washes in ethanol, the
papers were air-dried and incubated with amyloglucosidase
(Sigma). The resulting glucose was measured with a Gluco-quant
kit (ABX entra). The amount of glycogen is represented as the
amount of released glucose per mg of total protein. L-Lactate
levels in the incubation medium were measured as described [36].
GS and GP activity determination- To measure GS and GP activities,
frozen plates were scraped with 300 ml of homogenization buffer
consisting of 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mM KF, 15 mM
EDTA, 600 mM sucrose, 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mg/ml
leupeptin, 1 mM benzamidine and 1 mM PMSF, and the
collected cells were subsequently sonicated. The resulting
homogenates were used for the determination of enzymic
activities. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad
protein assay. GP activity was determined by measuring the
incorporation of [U-14C]glucose 1-phosphate into glycogen in the
absence or presence of AMP (5 mM) as describe previously [37].
The GS activity ratio was determined by measuring the
incorporation of [U-14C]UDP-glucose into glycogen in the
absence or presence of 6.6 mM glucose 6-phosphate, as described
previously [38]. The activity measured in the absence of Glc-6-P
represents the active form of the enzyme (I or a form), whereas that
measured in the presence of 6.6 mM Glc-6-P represents total GS
activity.
Western Blot—Immediately after treatments, cells were washed
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 70–
200 ml of 1x Laemmli sample buffer (2%SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-
mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue and 0.125 M Tris
HCl pH 6.8). Lysates were sonicated for 4 s, centrifuged at 4uC for
2 min at 14,0006g, and resolved on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (50 mM
Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated
overnight at 4uC with the indicated antibodies (HIF1a was from
R&D systems, ref. MAB1536 and GYS1 was from Cell Signalling,
ref 3893). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the
Amersham Biosciences ECL system.
ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)- For ChIP assays, c2c12 cells
were grown on 10 cm plates until they reached 85% confluence, at
which point they were exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen) or left
under normoxic conditions for a further 5 h. Subsequently, cells
were fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde (final concentration) for
12 min at 37uC. Crosslinking was stopped by the addition of
0.125 M glycine (final concentration).The cells were washed with
cold PBS and then lysed by scraping in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1%
SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, and a protease
inhibitor cocktail, Roche). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for
10 min and then sonicated to shear the DNA under conditions
established to ensure that the DNA fragments were between 200
and 1500 bp. After the removal of the insoluble material by
centrifugation, 30 ml of each sample was removed and stored
(input), while the rest was diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer
(1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM
Tris/HCl, pH 8.1). The lysates were precleared with preimmune
serum and 200 mg of a Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A agarose
50% slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, U.S.A.) for
1 h at 4uC. The samples were then immunoprecipitated twice,
initially with whole rabbit serum for 6 h (IgG control) and then
overnight at 4uC with a polyclonal anti-HIF1alpha antiserum
(Abcam, ab2185). Immunocomplexes were recovered by the
addition of 400 mg of Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A agarose
50% slurry to the samples that were then sequentially washed for
15 min in TSE I (0.1%SDS, 1%Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA,
20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, and 150 mM NaCl), TSE II (0.1%
SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris/HCl,
pH 8.1, and 500 mM NaCl) and buffer III (0.25 M LiCl, 1%
Nonidet P40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris/
HCl, pH 8.1). Finally, the complexes were washed twice with TE
buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA) and extracted
twice with a buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO3. The
eluates were pooled, and cross-linking was reversed by the addition
of 200 mM NaCl (final concentration) and overnight incubation at
65uC. The proteins were removed by the addition of proteinase K
(30 mg/sample) for 2 h at 42uC, and the DNA was extracted using
Qiagen PCR extraction kit before eluting in 50 ml of water.
Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by PCR using the
primers indicated:
GYS1F:TCGGATCCGGTACCGCTTTACGGAAACGAGTG
GYS1R:TACTCGAGGGTACCGAACTCCTGGGTCCATTC
P4HaF: ATCAAGGAGGCAAACTGAACAG
P4HR: ACTCGGAGCGGCTACTTCCTA
The PCR products were resolved by gel electrophoresis and
visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR— Total RNA was extracted
and purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). 1 mg of total RNA
from each sample was retrotranscribed to cDNA (Improm-II reverse
transcriptase; Promega). 1–3 ml of cDNA samples were used as
template for amplification reactions carried out with the LC Fast
Start DNA master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplifications were
carried out in a Light Cycler System (Roche Applied Science), and
data were analyzed with LightCycler software 3 version 3.5.28
(Idaho Technology Inc.). For each sample, duplicate determinations
were made, and the gene expression determined by the DDCt
method using b-actin as reference gene. The primer used in this
study are (59-39): GYS1, forward (TTCTACAACAACCTGGAG)
and reverse (CTGAGCAGATAGTTGAGC); GYS2, forward
(TTACCAGCATGCCAGACAC) and reverse (AGAAGGTGG￾TACTGAGG); HIF 1alpha , forward (GTTTACTAAAGGA￾CAAGTCACC) and reverse (TTCTGTTTGTTGAAGGGAG); b￾actin forward (CCCAGAGCAAGAGAGG) and reverse (GTCCA￾GACGCAGGATG). UGP2, forward (CAGAGACCTCCAGAA￾GATTCG) and reverse (GTTCAACACAGAAGATATGTTAT￾CAGG); GBE1, forward (GCTCGGTGGAGAAGGCTAT) and
reverse (CTTGGGAAGTCCAACCATTC).
Cell viability assay.- HepaC1, HepaC4, HepaC1-Ad1 (stably
expressing a control shRNA) and HepaC1-Ad5 cells (stably
expressing a shRNA directed to mouse GYS1) were seeded in
96-well plates at a density of 56103
/well in 100 ml of complete
medium. Then the cells were incubated in normoxia or in hypoxia
for 24 h. After treatments culture media was removed, cells were

washed, changed to glucose and serum free medium, and
incubated in normoxia or in anoxia for additional 16 hours. Cell
viability was determined with the CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay
(Promega, WI). Luciferase activity was detected in a microplate
luminometer reader (E6521;Promega,WI).
Statistical analysis of data– Experimental data were analyzed with
the PrismTM GraphPad (version 4.01) software. Data were
analyzed by the analysis of variance test (ANOVA) followed by
the Tukey’s or Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Significant
differences with control values (indicated in each figure legend) are
shown by asterisks.
