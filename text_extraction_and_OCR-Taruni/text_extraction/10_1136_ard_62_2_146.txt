Abstract
Objectives: To estimate the incidence of severe lung disease in
patients with scleroderma and identify the combination(s) of
features present at first assessment which would be useful to predict
future risk of severe lung disease.
Methods: Data were analysed on 561 patients with disease onset
occurring on or after 1 January 1982 and disease duration of less
than five years before the first assessment. Detailed clinical and


laboratory assessments were undertaken at the initial visit. End
stage lung disease was defined as pulmonary hypertension requiring
continuous ambulatory iloprost, or pulmonary fibrosis requiring
continuous oxygen, or death from a scleroderma related lung
disease. Patient status was determined at 31 December 1997. The
best subset of predictors was identified by Cox regression analysis.
Results: In all, 24 patients reached end stage lung disease. The
cumulative incidences were 4%, 6%, and 12% at five, seven, and 14
years respectively. As expected, the lung function tests at baseline,
including being in the lowest third of either diffusing lung capacity
(hazard ratio (HR) = 18.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to
93.8) or of forced vital capacity (HR=4.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 15.2),
were highly significant predictors of end stage lung disease.
Interestingly, apart from the presence of proteinuria, none of the
other baseline variables, including the extent of skin disease and
serological markers, were predictive of severe lung disease.
Conclusion: End stage lung disease was infrequent in this large
cohort, but the cumulative incidence increased importantly with
time. The risk can be predicted from baseline assessment of
pulmonary function. In particular, those with normal pulmonary
function at baseline are at very low risk.
