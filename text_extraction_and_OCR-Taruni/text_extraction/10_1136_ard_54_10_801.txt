Risk of vertebral fracture and relationship to bone
mineral density in steroid treated rheumatoid
arthritis
N F A Peel, D J Moore, N A Barrington, D E Bax, R Eastell
Abstract
Objectives-To determine the prevalence
of vertebral fracture in postmenopausal
women with steroid treated rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), and whether the risk of
vertebral fracture could be predicted from
measurements of bone mineral density
(BMD).
Methods-Vertebral deformities were
defined from spine radiographs in 76
postmenopausal women with steroid
treated RA (aged 50-79 years) and 347 age
matched women from a population based
group, using a morphometric technique.
Lumbar spine (LS) BMD was measured
by dual energy x ray absorptiometry.
Results-The odds ratio for vertebral
fracture in the women with RA was 6-2
(95% confidence interval 3*2 to 12-3). The
decrease in LS-BMD was less than
expected for the observed prevalence of
vertebral fracture and, among the women
with RA, LS-BMD was not lower in those
with vertebral fractures.
Conclusions-We conclude that patients
with steroid treated RA may have
abnormal bone quality, and that LS-BMD
cannot be used to predict the risk of
vertebral fracture in these patients.

Bone loss is a well recognised complication
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is not only
localised around inflamed joints, but also
affects skeletal sites distant from them, such
as the lumbar spine and proximal femur.'`5
The aetiology of bone loss is likely to be
multifactorial. Studies have demonstrated that
disease activity is a determinant of bone loss in
RA6 and may be mediated by the release of
bone resorbing cytokines such as interleukin-1
(IL- 1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) from
the inflamed synovium.7 Other determinants
of bone loss in RA may include physical
inactivity,6 8 9 weight loss, 1 and the use of
drugs such as corticosteroids." 12
In type I osteoporosis, the risk of vertebral
fracture has been shown to increase two- to
threefold for every SD decrease in bone
mineral density of the lumbar spine (LS-BMD)
below the expected value.3 The risk ofvertebral
fracture may therefore be expected to be
increased in RA. Because vertebral fractures
may be asymptomatic, their prevalence can
only be determined from radiological surveys.
Spector et al recently reported that the rate of
vertebral fracture was increased in post￾menopausal women with RA, some of whom
were treated with oral corticosteroids, but that
BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck
was not lower in the women with vertebral
fracture.'4 They did not compare BMD of the
women with RA and the controls. Their results
suggest that the relationship between vertebral
fracture risk and BMD may differ in secondary
osteoporosis compared with type I osteoporosis.
The aims of this study were to determine
the prevalence of vertebral fracture in post￾menopausal women with RA who had been
treated with corticosteroids, in comparison
with population based controls, and to deter￾mine whether BMD measurement could
predict the risk of vertebral fracture in these
women.
Subjects and methods
We studied 76 postmenopausal women with
RA (ages 50-79 (mean 65) years), and 347
women from a population based group (ages
50-79 (mean 64) years) as controls. There was
no difference in menopausal age between the
groups (mean time since menopause 16 years
in the RA group compared with 18 years in the
controls). None of the 76 women in the RA
group was receiving hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) at the time of the study, com￾pared with 19 of the 347 controls (5-5%).
None of these 19 was included in the group
of 20 women comprising the BMD controls
(see below).
Each subject gave informed consent and the
study was approved by the ethics committees
of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and the
Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.
POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH RA
The women with RA were invited to par￾ticipate in a clinical study of bisphosphonate
treatment for the prevention of bone loss. The
inclusion criteria for the study were that they
were white, postmenopausal, had a diagnosis
of rheumatoid arthritis (as defined by the
American Rheumatism Association 1987
criteria'5) in functional grades I_III,16 and had
received corticosteroid treatment for at least six
months. Postmenopausal status was defined as

more than six months having elapsed since
their last menstrual period, together with
appropriate serum concentrations of oestradiol
and follicle stimulating hormone. The disease
duration in the women studied ranged from
three to 45 years (>15 years in 90%), and they
had all received treatment with prednisolone
for between one and 40 years (mean current
dose 4-7 mg/day; 85% of subjects had received
steroid treatment for >10 years). The majority
of patients were treated at a dose of 2 5 or
5 mg daily, and four had received doses greater
than 10 mg/day for short periods in the past.
The cumulative dose of steroid ranged between
2-5 and 79 g (mean 28-8, median 27-0 g).
Subjects were excluded if they had evidence
of secondary causes of osteoporosis other than
RA or steroid treatment (all had normal results
for serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phos￾phatase, creatinine, thyroxine, thyroid stimu￾lating hormone and parathyroid hormone
(PTH), and 24 hour urine calcium excretion),
or a history of any other acute or chronic
medical condition likely to affect BMD.
Subjects were also excluded if they had
received previous treatment with drugs known
to influence bone turnover.
All women fulfilling these criteria who
attended outpatient clinics of one consultant
rheumatologist (DEB) over a 10 month period
were invited to attend for a screening assess￾ment, at which time the clinical assessment was
made, and spinal radiographs were obtained.
The uptake rate from these clinics is unknown.
Among the women with RA included in
this study, 19 were currently receiving disease
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
(sulphasalazine seven; IM sodium auro￾thiomalate eight; hydroxychloroquine two;
methotrexate two), 38 were currently receiving
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
and 60 were receiving simple analgesics.
POPULATION BASED (CONTROL) GROUP
A cohort of 375 women aged 50-85 years had
been selected randomly from a population
based group from three general practice lists in
Sheffield (uptake rate 55%) and were taking
part in a study of the prevalence of osteo￾porosis. From this cohort, we took the 347
women younger than 80 years to comprise our
control group for the prevalence of vertebral
deformities. Because the densitometer used in
the population based study differed from ours,
invalidating any direct comparison of BMD
values between the studies, 20 healthy women
from the population based cohort were
selected as a control group to create our own
reference range of BMD values. The original
BMD Z scores at each skeletal site in these
20 women had been representative of their
population based group (see below). They
were selected from the larger cohort on the
basis that they had no evidence of arthritis on
history or examination, and no evidence of
significant degenerative change on spinal
radiographs. None had received drugs known
to affect bone metabolism, and biochemical
screening excluded diseases likely to affect
bone metabolism (serum thyroxine, calcium,
phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, PTH and
creatinine, and 24 hour urine calcium
excretion all within normal limits).
DEFINITION OF VERTEBRAL FRACTURE
Each subject had anteroposterior (AP) and
lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar
spine, taken at a standard target to film
distance of 100 cm. Thoracic films were
centred on vertebra T7 and lumbar films on
vertebra L2. Vertebral deformities were defined
according to the morphometric criteria of
Eastell et al. 17 In this method the anterior (ha),
posterior (hp) and mid (hm) height of each
vertebra from T4 to L5 are measured on the
lateral radiographs and deformities defined for
each vertebra as:
O/o wedge = (hp - ha)/hp x 100
%biconcavity = (hp - hm)/hp X 100
% compression = (hp' - hp)/hp' X 100
where hp' is the posterior height of the vertebra
below or the vertebra above. The deformities
for each vertebra were compared with pub￾lished normative data from women'7 and a
vertebra was considered to be fractured if it had
a deformity more than 3 SD less than the mean
for that vertebra.
Marking of the radiographs was performed
by a single observer. The AP radiographs
were used to identify the vertebra and to take
account of anomalous segmentation which we
have shown to affect 16.5% of individuals.'8
Radiographs were assessed for the presence
of vertebral deformities resulting from
fracture or other causes, by a consultant
radiologist (NAB, DJM) blind to the results
from the morphometric analysis of the
radiographs.
BONE DENSITOMETRY
BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck
(FN-BMD), and total body (TB-BMD) were
measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry
(Hologic QDR 1000/W, Hologic Inc, Waltham,
MA) in all the women with RA and the 20
healthy women from the population based
group (aged 54-77 (mean 63) years). The
reproducibility of BMD measurements using
the Hologic QDR 1000/W was assessed from
duplicate measurements in 20 women aged
27-77 years, of whom 12 had RA. The
precision error, calculated as a coefficient of
variation, was 1-4% at the lumbar spine, and
2-9% at the femoral neck. Vertebrae which
were identified as being fractured within the
region of analysis (Li to L4) were excluded
from the analysis to avoid artificial over￾estimation of measured LS-BMD.
The BMD of the 20 healthy controls,
measured previously using a different densi￾tometer (Lunar DPX, Lunar Corp, Madison
WI) was representative of the 375 women in
the population based group from which they
were selected (mean Z scores normalised for
age and weight: -0 01, 95% confidence interval

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The proportions of women with vertebral
fractures were compared by calculation of
odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.'9
Differences in BMD were examined by com￾parison ofZ scores (expressed as SD units from
the expected value) using t tests and analysis
of variance. Scheffe test was used to test for
heterogeneity between groups. The relation￾ship between normally distributed variables
was examined using Pearson's correlation
coefficients. Precision was calculated as the
ratio of SD of duplicate measurements to mean
BMD, expressed as a percentage. Analyses
were performed using Statgraphics Statistical
Graphics System (Statistical Graphics Cor￾poration, Rockville, MD).
Results
VERTEBRAL FRACTURE RATES
Table 1 shows the vertebral deformity rates,
defined using the morphometric algorithm, in
the women with steroid treated RA and the
population based controls. In the group as a
whole there was an increased prevalence of
vertebral deformities (odds ratio 6-2, 95% CI
3-2 to 12-3) that was most marked in women
aged 50-59 years. Radiological assessment
suggested that eight of the deformities defined
by the algorithm (20%; four in the RA group,
and four in the control group) were the result
of pathology other than vertebral fracture.
These were parallax errors resulting from
severe scoliosis (five), Scheuermann's disease
(two) and spondylolisthesis (one). The preva￾lence of vertebral deformity believed to result
from pathology other than fracture was 1% in
the controls and 5% in the women with RA
(NS: 95% CI of difference, -9 to 1%).
Vertebral deformities both in women with
RA and in controls were evenly distributed
between the thoracic and lumbar spine. In the
women with RA, 63% of deformities were of
thoracic vertebrae, and in the controls, 61% of
deformities were of thoracic vertebrae. This
reflects the proportion of vertebrae assessed
(T4 to L5, of which 64% were thoracic).

Table 2 shows the number of subjects with
single and multiple vertebral deformities. In
the women with RA the number of these
deformities did not relate to factors such as
BMD, age, height, weight, disease duration, or
steroid treatment (mean daily or cumulative
dose, or duration of treatment).
BONE MINERAL DENSITY
Table 3 shows the decrease in BMD in the
women with RA compared with the healthy
controls, and the figure illustrates the decrease
in BMD expressed as Z scores. The BMD in
RA was decreased by 10-16%, or 0-8-1-5
SD units: the mean (95% CI) Z scores were
-0.79 (-1-05 to -0 51) (lumbar spine), -1-15
(-1-36 to -0 94) (neck of femur), and -1-46
(-1.81 to -111) (total body). There was no
difference in BMD at any site between those
women with and without vertebral deformities
(table 3), and the women with deformities did
not differ from those lacking them with respect
to age, height, weight, disease duration, or
steroid treatment (mean daily or cumulative
dose, or duration of treatment).
In the women with RA, LS-BMD correlated
with body weight (r = 0 39, p < 0 001), which
was lower than that of healthy controls
(58-7 v 64-6 kg; 95% CI of difference -10-7 to

the effect of weight and the presence or

for weight (LS-BMD, p = 005; FN-BMD,
p < 00001; TB-BMD, p < 00001).
Disease activity, assessed by erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, correlated with LS-BMD
(r = -0-28, p = 0 02). There was no correlation
between BMD, at any site, and age. There was
no correlation between BMD and disease
duration, duration of steroid treatment, or
daily or cumulative dose of corticosteroid.
Multiple linear regression did not demonstrate
an effect of current DMARD, NSAID or
analgesic treatment on BMD measurements or
fracture risk.
Discussion
This study suggests that postmenopausal
women with steroid treated RA are at increased
risk of vertebral fracture, but the proportions
of risk attributable to the disease itself or to
the concomitant steroid treatment cannot be
determined from our data. The greatest risk of
vertebral fracture appeared to be in the
younger women with RA, but the number of
patients younger than 60 years was small, as is
reflected by the wide confidence limits for
the odds ratio. The distribution of vertebral
deformities between the thoracic and lumbar
vertebrae did not differ between the groups,
and the numbers of subjects with multiple
vertebral deformities were similar (table 2).
The increased risk of fracture is in agreement
with the one previous study in which
morphometric criteria were used to define
vertebral fractures in RA.4 The lower odds
ratio for vertebral fracture in that study may
reflect the fact that only 34% of the women
in the study were receiving corticosteroids,
though we have found no association between
BMD and duration of steroid use, mean daily
dose, or cumulative dose, and no difference in
steroid use between the women with and
without vertebral fractures.
The high odds ratio for vertebral fracture
could also result from an underestimate of the
prevalence of vertebral deformities in the
control population. However, the marking of
the radiographs of both the patients and
controls was performed by a single individual,
and the prevalence of vertebral deformities
identified by the morphometric algorithm was
in very close agreement with the prevalence
rates defined by experienced radiologists
(NAB and DJM), who were blind to the results
of the morphometric analysis. The prevalence
of vertebral deformities within the population
based group was also very similar to that
established in another UK population using
the same morphometric algorithm.20
In type I osteoporosis, we would expect an
odds ratio for vertebral fracture risk greater
than 6 to be associated with a decrease in
LS-BMD of 2-3 SD, yet in this cohort of
women with steroid treated RA, the LS-BMD
was decreased by only 0 79 SD. As the SD of
LS-BMD measurements was significantly
smaller in our control group compared with the
population from which they were selected,
there may be an overestimate of the Z score.
The smaller decrease in LS-BMD than expected
for the prevalence of vertebral fracture, and the
fact that there was no difference in LS-BMD
between the women with and without vertebral
fractures, could be artefactual or could reflect
defective bone quality in the women with
steroid treated RA. Alternatively, it may reflect
the impact on the skeleton of other factors
associated with RA, such as the increased
tendency of patients with arthritis to fall,2' or
altered biomechanics of the spine resulting
from these patients' multiple deformities.
Our results could have been explained if a
high proportion of the vertebral deformities
defined by the morphometric algorithm in the
women with RA were the result of pathology
other than vertebral fracture. However, review
of the spine radiographs by consultant radio￾logists did not support this idea. Similarly,
there may have been a high proportion of
traumatic vertebral fractures, which would not
necessarily be associated with low BMD.
Although this is not easy to quantify, there was
no supporting evidence from the case records.
Another possibility was that the women
with vertebral fractures had more severe
degenerative disease of the spine which led to
an artefactual increase in LS-BMD. This
concept was not supported by review of the
spine radiographs, and after exclusion of
subjects with significant degenerative change
of the lumbar spine from the analysis,
there remained no difference between the
groups.
It has been demonstrated in several studies
that in type I osteoporosis BMD measurements
are site specific-that is, the fracture risk at a
particular skeletal site is best predicted by
BMD at that site.22 23 We would therefore
expect measurement of LS-BMD to have
superior diagnostic sensitivity for vertebral
fracture than measurement of FN-BMD or
TB-BMD. Nonetheless, the fact that there was
also no difference in TB- or FN-BMD between
the women with and without fractures (table 3)
suggests that the poor diagnostic sensitivity of
BMD measurement in steroid treated RA is the

Vertebralfractures in steroid treated RA
result of heterogeneity in bone quality rather
than artefactual problems ofLS-BMD measure￾ment in these women.
BMD measurements are believed to reflect
approximately 75% of the variability in bone
strength;24 bone quality contributes to the
remaining 25%: for example, there may be
differences in the frequency of trabecular
perforation, or in the elasticity of bone. The
use of novel techniques of bone measurement
such as ultrasound densitometry, which may
reflect trabecular architecture, or lateral
LS-BMD measurement by dual energy x ray
absorptiometry (which may be a more sensitive
measure of trabecular bone loss in cortico￾steroid induced osteoporosis than the antero￾posterior technique we used25), may help to
resolve this question.
The design of our study did not permit
determination of the independent effects of
steroid treatment and RA on the skeleton.
There remains no consensus on the effect of
low dose corticosteroid treatment on bone
mass in RA. Although many studies have
shown decreased BMD in patients treated with
steroids compared with non-steroid-treated
patients,3 5 11 others have failed to demonstrate
this.4 26 There is evidence that the deleterious
effect of steroids may be restricted to the use
of more than 5 mg of prednisolone daily in
postmenopausal women with RA, and that
doses of up to 7-5 mg daily may not be harmful
to bone in premenopausal women and in men
with RA.4 12 However, a greater adverse effect of
corticosteroids in premenopausal women has
been shown,27 while a decreased rate of loss of
total body BMC has been demonstrated in
patients receiving corticosteroids, despite their
having a lower initial normalised bone mass than
the non-steroid-treated patients.28 This sug￾gested that the deleterious effect of steroid treat￾ment may occur in the initial phase of treatment.
The possibility also exists that other medi￾cation may have influenced the development of
osteoporosis and vertebral fractures in the
women we studied. Although a multiple linear
regression model failed to show either
DMARD or NSAID treatment to influence
BMD or vertebral fracture prevalence in this
cohort, this does not exclude the possibility
that these medications may have influenced the
skeletal status of these women. Current medi￾cation may not be representative of previous
medication, particularly in view of the long
disease duration in these subjects. Similarly, it
is not possible from a cross sectional study to
determine the influence of these medications
on underlying disease activity.
In summary, we have demonstrated a con￾siderable increase in the risk of vertebral
fracture in postmenopausal women with
steroid treated RA. The relative effects of corti￾costeroid treatment and the disease itself could
not be determined from this study. Although
LS-BMD was significantly decreased in these
women, the magnitude of this decrease could
not fully explain the increase in risk of vertebral
fracture. BMD measurements did not differ￾entiate between women with and without
vertebral fractures. We speculate that there
may be a bone quality defect in steroid treated
RA, perhaps mediated by increased bone turn￾over and increased trabecular perforation. We
conclude that measurement of LS-BMD may
not be a useful assessment of fracture risk in
this form of secondary osteoporosis.
