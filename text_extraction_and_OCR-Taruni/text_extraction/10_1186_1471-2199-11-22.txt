Abstract
Background: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) is a highly sensitive method for mRNA quantification, but
requires invariant expression of the chosen reference gene(s). In pathological myocardium, there is limited
information on suitable reference genes other than the commonly used Gapdh mRNA and 18S ribosomal RNA. Our
aim was to evaluate and identify suitable reference genes in human failing myocardium, in rat and mouse post￾myocardial infarction (post-MI) heart failure and across developmental stages in fetal and neonatal rat myocardium.
Results: The abundance of Arbp, Rpl32, Rpl4, Tbp, Polr2a, Hprt1, Pgk1, Ppia and Gapdh mRNA and 18S ribosomal
RNA in myocardial samples was quantified by RT-qPCR. The expression variability of these transcripts was evaluated
by the geNorm and Normfinder algorithms and by a variance component analysis method. Biological variability
was a greater contributor to sample variability than either repeated reverse transcription or PCR reactions.
Conclusions: The most stable reference genes were Rpl32, Gapdh and Polr2a in mouse post-infarction heart failure,
Polr2a, Rpl32 and Tbp in rat post-infarction heart failure and Rpl32 and Pgk1 in human heart failure (ischemic
disease and cardiomyopathy). The overall most stable reference genes across all three species was Rpl32 and
Polr2a. In rat myocardium, all reference genes tested showed substantial variation with developmental stage, with
Rpl4 as was most stable among the tested genes.
Background
Quantification of mRNA abundance is a central tool in
studying pathological and compensatory mechanisms in
heart failure. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
has rapidly replaced other methods, allowing quantifica￾tion of many gene transcripts in limited tissue samples
and more sensitive detection of weakly expressed tran￾scripts [1]. However, this level of sensitivity requires a
careful choice of method for comparison of expression
data between samples. The most common strategy is to
normalize the expression of a specific gene to a single
reference gene, assuming that the reference gene expres￾sion is invariant between the compared physiological
states. Variation in the reference gene expression
between samples would therefore reflect variations in
sample preparation and experimental variability. Several
studies have concluded that it is difficult to identify gen￾eral reference genes which can be used in all
experimental settings, and that validation of the chosen
reference gene(s) is important for each experimental set￾ting [2-5].
In the heart failure literature, glyceraldehyde 3-phos￾phate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) and 18S ribosomal RNA
are the most frequently used reference genes in quantifi￾cation of gene expression, see e.g. [6-8]. In rat neonatal
cardiomyocytes, it was shown that Gapdh expression
was invariant with different hypertrophic stimuli [9], but
was decreased in electrically stimulated cells [10]. In a
recent rat post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) heart
failure study, the interpretation of changes in gene
expression was dependent on the choice of Gapdh or
18S as reference gene [11]. Only one recent study has
examined possible reference gene candidates in human
myocardium by mining public microarray data [12].
The aim of our study was to identify alternative refer￾ence genes to Gapdh and 18S rRNA for use in mouse
and rat post-myocardial infarction heart failure models
and in human heart failure studies. Since fetal and neo￾natal rat cardiomyocytes are commonly used in cardiac
hypertrophy and signal transduction experiments, we

also evaluated a subset of candidate reference genes in
neonatal and embryonic myocardium in comparison to
adult myocardium. In addition we have investigated the
sources of variation in gene expression quantification
data in terms of RNA preparation methods, technical
replicates and biological sample variability.
Results
Total RNA sample quality
Each total RNA sample was evaluated extensively by
optical density, RNA profiling (Bioanalyzer) (Table 1)
and the linearity of 18S serial dilution curves (data not
shown). The 260 nm/280 nm optical density (O.D.)
ratios for rodent and human total RNA samples were
similar regardless of isolation method, with no differ￾ence between the groups within each species (Table 1).
The 28S/18S area ratios were consistently low (1.3), but
the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values were consistent
and comparable within each species and group: Sham
versus myocardial infarction (MI) or non-failing versus
failing, with an overall average of 8.0.
Interspecies variation in reference gene expression
The candidate genes Arb, Rpl32, Rpl4, Tbp, Polr2a,
Hprt1, Pgk1, Ppia for each species and 18S ribosomal
RNA were quantified by RT-qPCR. Due to the domi￾nance of 18S transcripts compared to the other refer￾ence genes of interest, the 18S data were used only as a
control of the RT reaction in addition to the RNA qual￾ity control (dilution curve linearity). In mouse hearts,
the post-MI/Sham ratio for 18S was significantly higher
than one (ratio 1.47, 95% CI: [1.19-1.82]). In rat hearts
the 18S post-MI/Sham ratio was also above one, but
with borderline significance (ratio 1.58, [1.00-2.51]). In
the human myocardium there was no significant differ￾ence (failing/non-failing ratio 1.19, [0.76-1.84]).
The overall variability in the relative abundance for
each reference gene and sample group, MI/Sham
(mouse and rat) or non-failing/failing (human) is shown
in Figure 1. The mean assay coefficient of variation
(CV) for each species was 8, 22 and 25% for mouse, rat
and human, respectively. We next estimated the factors
contributing to the gene expression variability by a var￾iance component analysis method (see Methods). For
mice, the relative size of the variance components for
triplicate PCR reactions, RT repeats and biological sam￾ples were 1:1:4. The corresponding relative variance
components for rat and human myocardium were 1:5:20
and 1:1:12, respectively. Overall, the biological samples,
rather than sample preparation or technical replicates,
contributed the most to the gene expression variability.
We found that gene expression variability was low for
most of the analyzed reference genes. However, Ppia
was highly variable in mice as was Gapdh in humans,
whereas Arbp was moderately to highly variable in all
species. In general, there was good correlation between
the stability values generated by the geNorm and Norm￾finder algorithms for all three species (Figure 2), and by
the variance component analysis (data not shown). The
overall rank order of the most stable reference for each
species is shown in Table 2, taking into account the
results from the geNorm, Normfinder and the variance
component analysis models. Stable candidate reference
genes include Rpl32, which obtained low variability
scores in all three species. The variability score for
Polr2a was low in mouse and rat (Figure 2). However,
human Polr2a was among the more variable genes
according to both geNorm and Normfinder, while visual
inspection (Figure 1C) and the variance component ana￾lysis suggested low variablity also in humans. This
inconsistency may have a methodological explanation,
see the discussion.
To test the robustness of our findings, we evaluated
the stability of a subset of reference genes in a second
independent set of rat total RNA from Sham and post￾MI myocardium (dataset 2). The samples prepared for
dataset 2 differed in sample storage (dataset 1, - 80C
freezer; dataset 2, RNALater), RNA isolation (dataset 1,
homogenizer and Trizol; dataset 2, bead mill and Trizol)
and cDNA priming methods (dataset 1, random hex￾amer; dataset 2, oligo-dT). Comparison of the same
genes for datasets 1 and 2 yielded a nearly identical

Reference gene stability across developmental stages in
rat myocardium
Fetal and neonatal cardiomyocyte preparations are used
as model systems for hypertrophy responses and induc￾tion of the fetal gene program. The stability of a subset
of reference genes was tested across a range of late fetal
and neonatal stages and in normal de novo adult rat
hearts. This subset was analyzed by geNorm across
developmental stage (M-values in parentheses), resulting
in the final ranking: Rpl4 (0.275), Arbp (0.289), Tbp
(0.355), Rpl32 (0.364) and Gapdh (0.421). A pronounced
shift in the Normfinder stability values, in particular for
Gapdh, was observed in the transition from neonatal to
adult myocardium (Figure 3A). Although none on the
tested genes were very stable, Normfinder considered
Rpl4 as the most stable reference gene across develop￾mental stage, in agreement with the geNorm results.
The impact of normalization to a single reference gene
with low (Rpl4, Arbp and Rpl32) or high (Gapdh) varia￾bility was evaluated in fetal, neonatal and adult stages
(Figure 3B). Normalization of the serotonin transporter
5-HTT (Slc6a4, SERT) mRNA to Rpl4 suggested that
5-HTT expression increased with developmental stage.
In contrast, normalization of 5-HTT to Gapdh indicated
only a transient increase in 5-HTT expression.
Discussion
We have identified several reference genes as alterna￾tives to Gapdh and 18S for use in gene expression quan￾tification in heart failure studies. The most stable
reference genes were Rpl32, Gapdh and Polr2a in
mouse post-infarction heart failure, Polr2a, Rpl32 and
Tbp in rat post-infarction heart failure and Rpl32 and
Pgk1 in human heart failure (ischemic disease and cardi￾omyopathy). The overall most stable reference genes
across all three species were Rpl32 and Polr2a. In rat
myocardium, Rpl4 was the most stable reference gene
across developmental stages.
It is generally accepted that the best normalization
strategy would be to calculate the geometric mean of
several reference genes [13]. However, this is not always
feasible with limited amounts of tissue. Several of the
reference gene candidates identified in this study should
be sufficiently stable for single-gene normalization of
gene expression data when necessary. We show that
Gapdh is not suitable as a reference gene in human fail￾ing myocardium. A recent study using human heart fail￾ure microarray data also reached a similar conclusion
[12].
Gene expression studies using fetal and neonatal heart
material often use single reference gene normalization
methods. Single reference gene normalization across
developmental stages may be difficult because of the
wide variation in expression at different developmental
stages [14]. We show here a marked shift in the expres￾sion stability of several reference genes in the transition
from neonatal to adult rat myocardium. This effect was
particularly pronounced for Gapdh, which would highly
influence the interpretation of results. We found that
Rpl4 and Rpl32 were better reference gene candidates
across developmental stages in rat myocardium.
To explore the significance of normalization to differ￾ent reference genes we analyzed the expression of the
serotonin 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) during fetal and
neonatal development as well as in adult heart. We have
previously demonstrated that the mRNA encoding the
5-HT4 serotonin receptor is significantly upregulated in
heart failure [11,15,16] and late fetal and neonatal devel￾opment (T. Brattelid, unpublished observations). Seroto￾nin plays an important role in cardiac development [17],
and the 5-HT transporter can indirectly modulate the 5-
HT4 response by regulating the extracellular 5-HT level
in cardiac muscle. Although the expression profile of
5-HTT in late fetal and neonatal heart seems to be inde￾pendent of the reference gene used, the estimated
5-HTT expression in the adult heart differs significantly

with the choice of reference gene (Figure 3B). Rpl32 and
Gapdh represent the extreme in each direction in stabi￾lity, whereas Rpl4 is the most stable reference gene
when comparing fetal, neonatal and adult heart tissue.
In the datasets for mouse, rat dataset 1 and human
reference genes, we originally included a test set of 4
commonly queried transcripts in the heart failure litera￾ture (Apt2a2, Pln, Slc8a1, Nppa) to test the impact of
choice of reference genes on gene expression ratios (MI/
Sham or Failing/Donor). In contrast to the fetal and
neonatal rat data, the ratios and statistical significance
in the adult datasets were not markedly affected by
choosing between the single most stable gene, the three
most stable genes, Rpl32 alone or Gapdh alone in each
species (data not shown). This was due to the very small
differences in the stability between the most stable refer￾ence genes in our datasets.
We found a surprising discrepancy in the variability
score for Polr2a between rodent and human datasets by
both the geNorm and Normfinder algorithms, being low
in mouse and rat (Figure 2), but high in the human
dataset. In contrast, the variance component analysis
indicated that human Polr2a was quite stable, and the
Polr2a expression levels were very similar in the donor
and failing human myocardial samples (Figure 1C). We
therefore examined whether this could be due to differ￾ences in the mathematical algorithms. geNorm uses
pairwise comparisons of genes and assumes that the
ratio between the expression values of two stable refer￾ence genes should be approximately equal in all experi￾mental samples [13]. A gene is regarded as less stable if
the pattern of variation between samples differs from
the pattern observed for the majority of candidate
genes, assuming that the majority are in average stable.
Normfinder uses analysis of variance on log-transformed
expression values, and all genes and samples are used
simultaneously to estimate expected expression values
[18]. A stable gene is expected to deviate only modestly
from these estimates. A stability value is computed
based on intra- and inter-group variations, where calcu￾lation of the latter assumes equal average expression of
the genes in the groups. Thus, although in a different
way from geNorm, Normfinder also assumes good
“average” behavior of the test genes. In the human myo￾cardial samples, the donor hearts tended to have higher
relative quantities than failing hearts for most of the
tested genes (Figure 1C). Polr2a expression was very
similar in the donor and failing groups, thereby deviat￾ing from the majority. Therefore, both geNorm and
Normfinder classify Polr2a as less stable. In contrast,
the variance component model considers the small dif￾ference between groups as an advantage. In light of
these considerations, we chose to include both human
Polr2a and rat Gapdh as satisfactory reference genes. A
recent report investigating gene expression variation
during the estrus cycle in female rats also discussed the
potential shortcomings of geNorm and Normfinder and
used similar methods to the variance component model
used in our study [19].
Excellent quality of total RNA is vital for obtaining
reliable quantification results [20-23]. The RNA sample
quality was comprehensively evaluated. Total RNA qual￾ity is traditionally estimated by the 260 nm/280 nm O.
D. ratio, even though this method has several shortcom￾ings [21]. All samples included in the study were
regarded as high quality using 260 nm/280 nm O.D.
ratio values. In contrast to the high 28S/18S ratios (>2)
usually obtained in cell lines, we found a low ratio (aver￾age 1.3) in myocardial tissue from all three species. Stu￾dies in human tissues have shown poor correlation
between the 28S/18S ratio and RNA sample quality
[20,21,23,24]. The RNA integrity number (RIN) is the
most recent qualitative indicator of total RNA sample
quality [20,21,24,25]. We found that the RIN values for
rat and mouse myocardial total RNA (average 8.0) were
consistent with values from solid tissues [20,21]. How￾ever, the RIN values for the human myocardial samples
were consistently lower and the variation in the RT￾qPCR data much larger than for mouse and rat, in parti￾cular for the failing hearts. This may be due to variable
states of severely failing human myocardial tissue or to
differences in the human sample harvesting time com￾pared to the rapid handling of rodent myocardial sam￾ples. Even though we obtained very similar results for
reference gene stability with rat datasets 1 and 2, which
had considerable differences in preparation and RT
priming methods, we cannot exclude that the difference
in results between the human and rodent datasets may
be due to differences in RNA isolation, cDNA priming
methods or choice of reverse transcriptase enzymes
[22,26].
In our comparison of the two independent datasets
from rat Sham and post-MI myocardium, we found that
the stability of the selected reference genes was indepen￾dent of sample processing and cDNA priming method,
thus strengthening our findings. We also found that the
biological variation contributed the most to the overall
quantification variability rather than technical steps such
as reverse transcription and PCR amplification reactions.
Thus, for myocardial samples, increasing the biological
sample size rather than number of RT reaction technical
replicates is a key factor for increasing the reliability of
gene expression analysis.
Conclusions
In the set of tested reference genes, the most stable
reference genes were Rpl32, Gapdh and Polr2a in
mouse post-infarction heart failure, Polr2a, Rpl32 and

Tbp in rat post-infarction heart failure and Rpl32 and
Pgk1 in human heart failure (ischemic disease and cardi￾omyopathy). The overall most stable reference genes
across all three species were Rpl32 and Polr2a. In rat
myocardium, Rpl4 was the most stable reference gene
across developmental stages. These reference genes
should be regarded as good a priori candidates, but vali￾dation of expression stability in each particular experi￾mental setting is recommended.
Methods
Selection of candidate reference genes
Candidate reference genes were selected based on pre￾vious use in Northern blots and competitive RT-PCR
and RT-qPCR studies in the literature: acidic ribosomal
phosphoprotein P0 (Arbp), ribosomal protein L32
(Rpl32), ribosomal protein L4 (Rpl4), TATA-box bind￾ing protein (Tbp), RNA polymerase II alpha subunit
(Polr2a), hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transfer￾ase (Hprt1), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1) and cyclo￾philin A (peptidyl prolyl isomerase A, Ppia),
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) and
18S ribosomal RNA.
Tissue material and total RNA sample sets
The B6/J mouse total RNA sample set was generated in
this study. Rat and human myocardial total RNA sample
sets were used previously in other studies in Wistar rats
(adult dataset 1[27], adult dataset 2 [11]), fetal and neo￾natal rat material (Brattelid et al, in preparation), and
humans [15]. Random samples that fulfilled basic “good
quality” OD 260/280 ratios (approximately 2.0) were
chosen from each sample set. The RNA quality of these
samples was reanalyzed more extensively in this study,
including RIN profiling (Table 1). Samples sizes for
datasets were as follows: mouse (Sham n = 3, MI n = 3),
rat dataset 1 (Sham n = 3, MI n = 3), rat dataset 2
(Sham n = 6, MI n = 6) and human (Donor n = 4, Fail￾ing n = 6).
Myocardial infarction (MI) in B6/J mice and Wistar
rats was induced by ligating the left anterior descending
coronary artery as described [27,28]. Age-matched Sham
animals underwent the same operative procedure, but
without ligating the artery. Mouse hearts were harvested
after 1 week, whereas rat hearts were harvested after 6
weeks. In the original studies, criteria indicative of con￾gestive heart failure (significantly increased left ventricu￾lar end-diastolic pressure, increased lung weight and
increased lung weight/body weight ratios) were used to
include mice and rats in the MI groups [28,29]. In post￾MI hearts, the infarct area and border zone were
removed and the remaining viable left ventricular wall
and septum were harvested. In Sham and de novo (con￾trol) animals, the left ventricular wall and septum were
harvested. Total RNA from a second set of rat left ven￾tricles from 6-week post-MI rat hearts, age-matched
Sham hearts and de novo animals [11], were used to test
whether the combined differences in tissue storage,
RNA isolation and cDNA priming methods would affect
reference gene stability results (rat data set 2).
Fetal rat hearts were harvested from embryos removed
under 2% isoflurane anesthesia at day 3 (n = 6) and day
1 (n = 5) before the expected term. Neonatal rat hearts
were harvested at 1 (n = 10), 3 (n = 6) and 5 (n = 6)
days after birth. Atria were removed and ventricles from
each litter were pooled. All animals were subjected to
approved protocols in accordance with the Norwegian
National Committee for Animal Welfare, conforming to
the European Convention for the protection of Vertebrate
animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Pur￾poses (Council of Europe no. 123, Strasbourg 1985).
Human samples were taken from left ventricular trabe￾culae from non-failing donor and failing hearts. The fail￾ing hearts were from patients undergoing heart
transplantation for end-stage heart failure, resulting
from ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy.
Samples were obtained under ethical approval #S01025
(Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway)
conforming to the Declaration of Helsinki. Mouse hearts
and rat hearts for dataset 1 and human samples were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Adult rat hearts
for dataset 2, fetal, and neonatal rat hearts were sub￾merged and stored in RNAlater™ (Applied Biosystems/
Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).
Mouse total RNA was isolated from left ventricular
myocardium using a tissue homogenizer (Polytron,
Kinemetica AG, Luzern, Switzerland) and SV total RNA
columns as described by the manufacturer (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Adult rat total RNA for dataset 1
was isolated from left ventricular myocardium [27]
using a tissue homogenizer and the phenol/chloroform
method as included in the Atlas™ Pure Total RNA
Labeling kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc. Mountain View,
CA, USA). Adult rat left ventricular total RNA for data￾set 2, fetal and neonatal RNA samples, were obtained by
washing the RNAlater-conserved tissue in sterile 0.9%
NaCl, followed by homogenization in 1.5 ml Trizol by
mill grinding (MM301, Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany)
with ceramic beads at 30 Hz, and isolatation of total
RNA by the Trizol method [11]. Total RNA from

Pooled standard samples used to generate relative
dilution curves for each species were prepared by mix￾ing equal amounts of total RNA from 3 Sham and 3 MI
hearts (mouse, rat), or 3 non-failing and 3 failing hearts
(human), and used throughout the study.
RNA quality control
RNA concentrations were measured (1.5 μl) in an ND￾1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wil￾mington, DE, USA). Samples were quality checked using
RNA 6000 Nano LabChips in a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agi￾lent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The RNA
integrity numbers (RIN) [25] were calculated by the
instrument software. 18S serial dilution curves were run
for each sample, and the linearity of the curves was
used to verify the absence of inhibitory substances.
RT-qPCR quantification
Mouse, rat (dataset 1), and human total RNA sample
sets were reverse transcribed using random primers and
TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (P/N N808-
0234, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each
RNA sample was reverse transcribed independently on
three separate days. All species-specific gene expression
assays were run on the same cDNA generated in each
independent RT reaction, thus allowing direct compari￾son of the relative abundance of all the reference genes
within each species. The second set of de novo, Sham
and post-MI adult rat myocardium total RNA as well as
fetal and neonatal rat total RNA (5 μg) were oligo-dT￾primed and transcribed with 400 U Superscript III (Invi￾trogen) in a 40 μl volume.
PCR assays were TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays or
Custom Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems)
(Table 3). All probes were labeled with 5’-FAM and 3’-
non-fluorescent quencher. Each PCR reaction contained
12.5 μl TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix®, 1.25 μl
assay stock (20×), primers (900 nM), probe (250 nM)
and cDNA in 25 μl final volume. PCR amplifications
were run in triplicates in 96-well plates with cycling
parameters 2 min 50°C; 10 min 95°C; 40 cycles of 5 s
95°C, 1 min 60°C in a 7700 (mouse) or a 7900 HT (rat,
human) Sequence Detection Instrument (Applied Bio￾systems). Assay performance was evaluated by serial
dilution curves and amplification efficiencies calculated
by the formula E = 10(1/-slope)-1 using the slope of the
relative dilution curve generated by species-specific
pooled standard samples (Table 3). The specificity of
each assay was verified on 2% agarose gels. To avoid
loss of low copy number cDNA species, carrier tRNA
was added to maintain a constant total nucleic acid
input in the PCR reactions. This reduced the standard
curve variability at high dilutions and in quantification
of low abundance transcripts (data not shown). Quanti￾fication of 18S and specific mRNA transcripts were run
at different cDNA input levels to accommodate the
large difference in 18S and mRNA abundance. For each
biological sample, the baseline and threshold settings
were identical for all RT runs for each gene-specific
assay. Non-normalized gene expression values were cal￾culated from species-specific standard sample serial dilu￾tion curves. The second set of control and post-MI
adult rat myocardium total RNA as well as fetal and
neonatal rat total RNA was analyzed using a subset of
TaqMan Gene expression assays for comparison.
Statistical analysis
The mean assay coefficient of variation (CV, given in %)
per species was calculated by first calculating the CV of
all data points for a given assay in a species, and then
calculating the mean CV value for all assays within that
species.
Reference gene expression variability was evaluated by
geNorm [13] and Normfinder [18] analysis methods.

Ratios were analyzed on the log scale to obtain approxi￾mately normally distributed observations (without out￾liers) and roughly equal variance across genes. Tests
were two-sided, and p < 0.05 considered significant.
Mixed linear models were used to accommodate the
nested experimental design and to estimate variance
components and expression ratios with associated confi￾dence intervals. Variance components included in the
model were the RT reactions and the samples (nested
within treatments), and with the triplicate PCR values
with each run as the basic observation. We also used
the sum of the variance components for the samples
and the triplicates as an additional tool when evaluating
gene expression stability. These types of models take
into account the study design, but are limited as a gen￾eral tool for evaluation of reference gene stability,
because they are sensitive to large variations in total
RNA quantity between samples.
