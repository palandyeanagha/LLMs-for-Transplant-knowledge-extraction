Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a renal disease characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hyperlipidemia.
Its presentation within the first 3 months of life or in multiple family members suggests an underlying inherited cause. To
determine the frequency of inherited NS, 62 cases (representing 49 families with NS) from Saudi Arabia were screened for
mutations in NPHS1, NPHS2, LAMB2, PLCE1, CD2AP, MYO1E, WT1, PTPRO and Nei endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL1). We
detected likely causative mutations in 25 out of 49 families studied (51%). We found that the most common genetic cause of
NS in our cohort was a homozygous mutation in the NPHS2 gene, found in 11 of the 49 families (22%). Mutations in the
NPHS1 and PLCE1 genes allowed a molecular genetic diagnosis in 12% and 8% of families, respectively. We detected novel
MYO1E mutations in three families (6%). No mutations were found in WT1, PTPRO or NEIL1. The pathogenicity of novel
variants was analyzed by in silico tests and by genetic screening of ethnically matched control populations. This is the first
report describing the molecular genetics of NS in the Arabian Peninsula.

INTRODUCTION
Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a renal disease characterized by
heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hyperlipidemia.1
Urinary losses of macromolecules such as albumin reflect a
dysfunction of the highly permselective glomerular filtration
barrier.2 The glomerular filtration barrier structure consists of
podocyte foot-process, glomerular basement membrane, endothelial
fenestration and the slit diaphragm. The identification of mutations
leading to defects in proteins highly expressed in the podocyte
and slit diaphragm has helped to unravel the basis of glomerular
filtration barrier physiology and pathophysiology.3 Kidney biopsies in
NS patients may show nonspecific changes such as minimal change,
as well as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and diffuse
mesangial sclerosis.4 A molecular genetic diagnosis is important for
making treatment decisions including suitability for renal
transplantation and to enable screening of other family members at
risk of disease.
NS may be given a series of descriptive labels dependent on their
age of presentation. Congenital NS (CNS) manifests in utero or
during the first 3 months of life;5 infantile NS has an onset between 3
months and 1 year of age5 and childhood steroid-resistant NS (SRNS)
may be defined as no urinary remission within 4 weeks of prednisone
therapy 60 mg m–2 day–1.
6 From a molecular genetics standpoint, NS
may be grouped into several types, which are briefly reviewed here.
NS type 1(NPHS1) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized
typically by CNS and often followed by a rapid progression to end￾stage renal disease (ESRD).7 Affected children are usually born
prematurely, with the mother having a large placenta.
Hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, abdominal distention and edema
appear soon after birth. Mutations in NPHS1 account for B50% of all
cases of CNS.5,8 Electron microscopic studies of the affected kidney in
murine models show effacement of the podocytes and absence of the
slit diaphragm.9 The Finmajor and Finminor mutations in NPHS1 are
seen in the majority of Finnish patients with CNS.7 Although NPHS1
mutations are considered the major genetic cause of CNS, it has also
been shown CNS may be caused by mutations in other genes.10
NS type 2 (NPHS2) is an autosomal recessive disorder typically
characterized by childhood SRNS, and may progress to end-stage
renal disease (ESRD).11 Kidney biopsies may show nonspecific
histologic changes such as minimal change, FSGS or diffuse
mesangial proliferation. Some patients show a later onset of the
disorder.12 Mutations in NPHS2 account for 42% of familial and 10%
of sporadic cases of childhood SRNS and have also been found in
39% of patients with CNS.2

NS type 3 (NPHS3) has been described in patients with infantile
NS and childhood SRNS whom show histological changes of diffuse
mesangial sclerosis on renal biopsy. Mutations in PLCE1 underlie this
condition.13,14
NS type 4 (NPHS4) is secondary to WT1 mutations, encoding the
transcription factor Wilms’ tumor-suppressor gene 1. As well as
causing Wilms’ tumor, Frasier syndrome and Denys Drash syndrome,
WT1 mutations may cause NS and progression to renal failure.
Histologically, the picture is usually diffuse mesangial sclerosis, but
renal biopsies may show FSGS.15 WT1 mutations may cause SRNS in
infants and children without features of Frasier syndrome16,17 and
have been reported in up to 9% of such cases. Genetic screening of
other cohorts, including African-American children with FSGS and
SRNS18 and Japanese children with CNS19 did not detect WT1
mutations.
NS type 5 (NPHS5) is characterized by CNS and very early-onset
progressive renal failure. Some patients have associated ocular
abnormalities including myopia, nystagmus and strabismus.20
Mutations in LAMB2 underlie this type of NS. Severe eye disease,
NS and developmental delay in association with LAMB2 mutations is
known as Pierson syndrome.21 Milder phenotypes with isolated renal
disease have been described with homozygous and compound
heterozygous missense mutations in LAMB2.
20
NS type 6 (NPHS6) was recently described in two consanguineous
families with childhood SRNS.22 The implicated gene is known as
PTPRO.
Heterozygous mutations in CD2AP typically cause adult onset NS,
with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and lead to the
histological diagnosis of FSGS.23 However, given its known
interaction with nephrin24 and podocin25 it may also account for
cases of childhood SRNS. Indeed, a homozygous CD2AP mutation in
a child presenting at the age of 10 months has recently been
described.26 In addition, a heterozygous CD2AP variant, together
with a NPHS2 variant, has been found in a child presenting at 3 and a
half years of age with SRNS and biopsy proven FSGS.27
Additional genes, some only very recently described, associated
with NS include ACTN4,
23 TRPC6,
28,29 INF2,
30 and MYO1E.
31
Recently, Nei endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL1), which encodes a
base-excision DNA repair enzyme and was postulated as a candidate
gene for NS in a single consanguineous family.32 Its role in NS
remains uncertain. Occasionally, NS may be part of more complex
syndromes and examples include Nail-Patella syndrome33 and
Galloway–Mowat syndrome.34
In this study, we screened for mutations in nine genes implicated in
inherited NS in a Saudi Arabian population with either CNS, infantile
NS or childhood SRNS. Such a study has never been conducted for
this part of the world. The Saudi Arabian population has a tribal
structure and the overall rate of consanguineous marriage is reported
to be over 55%, with regional variations.35,36 In such a population,
the identification of mutations in known recessive disease genes is an
important consideration and we were interested in our ability to
detect a molecular genetic cause of NS. Identification of a molecular
genetic cause of NS allows both a definitive diagnosis and improved
clinical management of the patient and at risk relatives. It is
noteworthy that the Saudi population is at high risk of renal
failure, with 133 incident cases per million population per year that
require renal replacement therapy.37,38
We identified 62 cases, representing 49 families with CNS,
infantile NS or childhood SRNS and undertook mutational analysis
in known and candidate NS genes. We found a high rate of mutations
in this cohort, solving 51% of cases. Direct sequencing identified
novel and likely pathogenic genetic variants in NPHS1, NPHS2,
MYO1E and PLCE1, increasing the known spectrum of mutations in
these genes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study cohort
This study has been approved by the research advisory council of King Faisal
Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (RAC#2050 045). Following informed
consent, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells using the Gentra
Systems PUREGENE DNA Isolation kit. A total of 62 samples from 49 different
families were obtained. Altogether, 25 samples were obtained from 12 families
with evidence of familial NS and 37 samples were obtained from families with a
single affected individual with NS. Clinical phenotypes included patients with
CNS, infantile NS and childhood SRNS. Consanguineous marriages were noted.
Clinical data and biopsy reports were reviewed where available.
Mutation analysis
Mutational screening was undertaken of known genes implicated in NS;
NPHS1 (RefSeq NM_004646.3), NPHS2 (RefSeq NM_014625.2), LAMB2
(RefSeq NM_002292.3), PLCE1 (RefSeq NM_016341.3), CD2AP (RefSeq NM_
012120.2), MYO1E (RefSeq NM_004998.3), WT1 (RefSeq NM_000378.4),
PTPRO (RefSeq NM_030667.2) and NEIL1 (RefSeq NM_001256552.1). Direct
sequencing of all coding exons and exon–intron boundaries was performed.
Oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of genomic DNA were
designed using Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/) and synthesized
by Metabion International AG (Munich, Germany). Primer sequences are
available on request. PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 ml containing
approximately 20 ng of genomic DNA and Qiagen (Manchester, UK) master
mix kit (including 1X PCR buffer, 100 mmol l–1 dNTP, pair, and 1 U per
reaction HotStar Taq polymerase) and 0.5 mmol l–1 primer. PCR products were
treated with the Agencourt AMPure PCR purification system (Agencourt
Bioscience Corporation, Beverly, MA, USA). PCR products were sequenced
using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems,
Beverly, MA, USA) as described by the manufacturer. Sequences were analyzed
using Mutation Surveyor software Version 3.24 (SoftGenetics LLC, State
College, PA, USA) and SeqMan II software 6.1 (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA).
Computational analyses of novel missense mutations were performed with
PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), Sorting Tolerant From
Intolerant (SIFT) (http://sift.jcvi.org/) and SNPs3D (single nucleotide poly￾morphism resource found at http://www.snps3d.org/). PolyPhen-2 scores
range from 0 to 1, the higher the score the more damaging the amino-acid
substitution. SIFT scores range from 0 to 1. The amino-acid substitution is
predicted damaging is the score is p0.05, and tolerated if the score is 40.05.
For SNPs3D, a positive score indicates a variant classified as non-deleterious,
and a negative score indicates a deleterious case.
To assess splicing effects we used the GeneSplicer software (http://
www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/GeneSplicer/gene_spl.shtml). In addition to data￾base searches, a control DNA panel from 175 individuals from a Saudi Arabian
population was used to screen for all novel sequence variants.
Human MYOIE (accession number NP_004989) was modelled using the
crystal structure of myosin-IE from Dictyostelium discoideum (protein data
bank accession code, 1LKX).39 The Modeller program40 was used to create a
three-dimensional model of MYOIE using the amino-acid sequence alignment
generated through HHPred.41 Figures were prepared using PyMOL (http://
www.pymol.org/).
RESULTS
Sixty-two individual cases affected with CNS, infantile NS, childhood
SRNS representing 49 families from the Arabian peninsula (Table 1)
were screened for mutations in the following genes: NPHS1, NPHS2,
LAMB2, PLCE1, MYO1E, WT1, PTPRO, NEIL1 and CD2AP. We
identified mutations known NS genes in 9 out of 12 families (75%)
where there was reported to be 41 affected member with NS,
suggesting an inherited cause (Table 1). A molecular genetic diagnosis
was obtained in 43% (16 out of 37) of families with a single affected

member with NS. All families in whom we detected mutations had a
history of consanguinity, most commonly first cousin marriages.
Overall, in this population, by screening nine genes implicated in
inherited NS we established a likely molecular genetic cause in 51% of
families (Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2). No mutations were found in WT1
following screening of exons 8 and 9, NEIL1 or PTPRO by screening
all coding exons. In this Saudi Arabian cohort, mutations in the NS
genes NPHS2, NPHS1 and PLCE1 account for 22%, 12% and 8% of

cases, respectively, of NS (Figure 1). Mutations in NPHS2 represent
over two-fifths of genetically proven NS in this population.
The unsolved families (Table 1) had a reduced incidence of
consanguinity, making the likelihood of sporadic NS higher in this
group. Comparing the clinical phenotypes of the groups of NS
patients who had a molecular genetic diagnosis compared with those
that remain unsolved, there were similar rates of end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) but CNS was a much more common finding in the
solved cohort. There was a wide spread of age of onset and
histological phenotypes in both groups of patients.
Previously published data from a world-wide cohort suggested that
B50% of CNS is caused by mutations in NPHS1.
8 In our cohort,
mutations in NPHS1 accounted for five out of eight cases (62.5%) of
CNS, which had a confirmed molecular genetic diagnosis.
Of the novel homozygous sequence variants in coding regions
(Table 3 and Figure 2), we identified three novel nonsense mutations,
a donor splice site mutation with a high likelihood of aberrant
splicing and two missense mutations. In silico predictions suggested
that these missense changes are pathogenic (Table 3). A detailed
analysis of the results for each gene is given below.
NPHS1
In this gene, we found six families carrying known7,42,43 or predicted
pathogenic mutations. Five of the mutations were found in the
homozygous state, and one (S22) was a compound heterozygous
mutation involving two previously reported variants P368L and
R460Q43 (Table 2). Here, segregation of the mutation from each
parent was confirmed (data not shown). None of our cohort had
Finmajor (nt121delCT, L41fsX91) or Finminor (c.3325C4T, R1109X)
mutations.7 The affected patient from family S3 had a homozygous
frame shift mutation in NPHS1 combined with a novel heterozygous
NPHS2 (c.761G4T; p.C254F) allele (Tables 2 and 4). A p.P264R

missense change was found in NPHS1 in two families (Table 5).
This allele has previously been identified as contributing to a
compound heterozygous mutation in NPHS1 in cases of severe
CNS.44,45 It has also been noted in cases of tri-allelic inheritance of
steroid-resistant FSGS.27 The P264R variant has a minor allele
frequency of 1% (rs34982899, dbSNP 1000 Genomes) and its
pathogenicity is not proven. Indeed it has recently been classified as
a polymorphism.46
One novel homozygous sequence variant was detected in the
NPHS1 gene (S37 Tables 2 and 3). This sequence variant is predicted
to be a splice site mutation affecting the 50
-splice donor site
(c.1627þ 2T4G) predicting exon skipping of exon 12. Another
novel heterozygous NPHS1 variant c.528T4C (p.S176S) is in a
highly conserved region, and may affect splicing at the acceptor site,
given that the 528T nucleotide is the second nucleotide within exon 5
(Table 4). This variant was found in a heterozygous state in two
patients from the same family (F22) in combination with a hetero￾zygous missense change in LAMB2 (c.1982G4A; p.R561Q; Table 4).
Another novel heterozygous NPHS1 variant c.840þ 6G4A was
found in five families, two of whom also had a homozygous mutation
p.Q1020X in PLCE1 gene (Tables 2 and 4). This NPHS1
c.840þ 6G4A variant was also found in 1.15% of our normal con￾trols, suggesting it is unlikely to be pathogenic in isolation (Table 4).
Of the six families with homozygous or compound heterozygous
NPHS1 mutations, five presented with CNS, whilst the other had a
milder phenotypes, consistent with previous reports.47
NPHS2
Among our NS cohort there were 11 families with NPHS2 mutations
(Tables 1 and 2). All mutations in affected individuals were in a
homozygous state consistent with known parental consanguinity.
Mutations detected in NPHS2 accounted for 44% of all the mutations
detected in our cohort.
Four of the NPHS2 mutations had previously been reported48–50
and two novel homozygous NPHS2 mutations were detected. These
included a nonsense mutation c.115C4T (p.Q39X), which is the
most premature truncating mutation reported so far in NPHS2 and a
missense mutation c.413G4C (p.R138P) in patients with SRNS. Of
note, this arginine residue at position 138 (R138) of podocin has been
the residue mutated in other cohorts, specifically p.R138Q and
p.R138X.48 Both mutations, R138Q and R138X, were reported in
SRNS patients. Indeed R138Q has been described as a founder
mutation in European populations.48 Huber and et al.51
demonstrated that this mutation causes a failure to recruit nephrin
into lipid rafts, providing important insights into the pathogenesis of
this NPHS2 mutation.

Genetic analysis of childhood nephrotic syndrome
MH Al-Hamed et al

Journal of Human Genetics

A novel heterozygous NPHS2 variant C254F was detected in a
patient homozygous for a c.515delCCA mutation in NPHS1
gene (Tables 2 and 4). The variant C254F was not predicted to be
definitely pathogenic by in silico models (Table 4) but neither was it
found in our normal controls. This suggests that C254F could be a
modifier allele.
Whilst screening our control population for novel NPHS2 variants,
we observed a NPHS2 variant P20L (data not shown) in 2.32% of
Saudi Arabian controls. This variant is of unknown functio￾nal significance52 and is rare in control European populations53 and
was not associated with a NS disease phenotype, suggesting that this
change should be considered as a rare polymorphism.
PLCE1
A novel homozygous mutation in PLCE1 (Q1020X) was detected in
four families in our cohort, with a broad range of phenotypes
(Tables 1 and 2). All affected individuals had the identical mutation,
and segregation was confirmed in two of the families (F5 and F15,
data not shown). This truncating mutation is predicted to have a
severe affect on the PLCE1 protein with loss of the PLC catalytic
domain, the protein kinase C conserved region and the Ras associa￾tion domain.13 Interestingly, each of the Q1020X mutations in exon 7
of PLCE1 gene was associated with the variant (c.4665þ 52G4C) in
intron 18 (Table 4).
Affected and unaffected daughters in a family of African ancestry
with SRNS (F17) were found to be homozygous for a rare variant
(K2173R) in PLCE1 (Table 4). We did not find this variant in our
Saudi Arabian control cohort. The affected F17 member was also
heterozygous for novel variants c.840 þ 6G4A in NPHS1 gene and
R644H in LAMB2 gene (Table 4).
MYO1E
We detected novel homozygous MYO1E mutations in three families
(Tables 1 and 2). All families presented with SRNS. In the first two
families, renal biopsy revealed FSGS in one case, progressing to end￾stage renal disease by 10 years of age and minimal change disease,
with preserved renal function in the other. The affected patients both
had a Y47X nonsense mutation, segregating from each parent (data
not shown). The Y47X is a severe truncating mutation, with a
predicted loss of all functional domains of the MYO1E protein,
including the motor-head domain, the calmodulin binding IQ
domain and the tail domain.31 The affected female patient in family
S17 presented at 8 years of age with SRNS and FSGS on renal biopsy
and progressed to end-stage renal disease after 4 years (Table 1). She
was found to have a T119I homozygous mutation (Table 2 and
Figure 2). The threonine residue at position 119 is conserved
throughout vertebrates (including zebrafish) and in the myosin-1d
homolog of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum where it is the
terminal residue of the P-loop motif (Figure 3).
CD2AP
A single patient presenting with CNS from family F23 in our NS
cohort was found to have two known heterozygous variants in
CD2AP (Tables 1 and 2). The first F220L is a variant of unknown
significance (rs139926926), in a residue conserved to Danio rerio and
was not detected in 350 healthy Saudi Arabian alleles. This variant was
combined with T374A, a likely pathogenic mutation.54 The
heterozygous T374A mutation in CD2AP was previously reported
in a 2-year-old child presenting with SRNS and histological features of
FSGS, and the missense change disrupts a proline-rich domain
important for protein–protein interactions.54

In addition, the CD2AP variant K301M was found as a hetero￾zygous allele in three of our patients; one was associated with
homozygous Q1020X mutation in PLCE1 gene (F5), other two (S14
and S16) were detected alone (Table 5). Although K301M has been
reported by Gigante et al.54 previously as a pathogenic mutation, we
also found this variant in 2.79% of our normal controls suggesting
that this variant is a polymorphism. The previously reported CD2AP
variant p.K301M was found a 23-year-old Italian female presenting
with SRNS and FSGS.54 The same mutation was found in her
6-year-old child who was reported as phenotypically normal.
Functional studies showed that at K301M variant had a defective
CD2–CD2AP interaction.54 The high frequency of the K301M variant
in the Saudi population would certainly point away from this
heterozygous variant alone being disease causing.
We speculate that CD2AP variants in the heterozygous state may
increase susceptibility toward glomerular damage and proteinuria but
until large-scale studies are conducted to elucidate the role of these
variants, they remain of uncertain pathogenicity.
LAMB2
We found novel heterozygous LAMB2 sequence variants in five
families from our cohort (Table 4). The affected patient in family
S18 had a L465P heterozygous variant in LAMB2 gene together with
an A1765T polymorphism in LAMB2;
55 (Tables 4 and 5). The L465P
missense change is novel, and was absent from control samples, but
predicted to be benign using in silico testing (Table 4).
In another family (F22), two affected patients (brothers) with FSGS
had a single heterozygous R561Q variant in LAMB2. This novel
variation of unknown severity was present in 0.27% of healthy
controls and was in combination with a novel heterozygous NPHS1
S176S variant, predicted to have some deleterious impact on splicing
(Table 4).
Additional novel (and likely polymorphic) variants were detected
in the LAMB2 gene (Table 4; Figure 2). A heterozygous L1258V
missense variant was detected in two families and also detected in
0.55% of our normal controls. The variant R644H was detected in
one allele of our patients and in 0.82% of normal controls.
Family S39 had a known heterozygous variant in LAMB2
(c.3443G4A; p.R1148H) in association with a heterozygous P264R
NPHS1 polymorphism (Table 5). This R1148H LAMB2 variant was
found also in 0.82% of our normal controls (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to describe the molecular basis of NS in a Saudi
Arabian population. Despite finding a high rate of mutations in
known NS genes within our cohort (51%), these findings suggest
there are other novel genetic causes of NS yet to be discovered. The
genetic heterogeneity underlying NS, even in this highly consangui￾neous population, is evident. It is noteworthy that all patients with
identified mutations in NS-associated genes were from consangui￾neous marriages and most of the pathogenic mutations identified
were in the homozygous state. There were two families (S22 and F23)
where we identified compound heterozygous mutations in NPHS1
and CD2AP, respectively. Thus, reliance on screening genes in
homozygous regions alone in known consanguineous families may
miss compound heterozygous changes in relevant genes. Our experi￾ence is not unique. Using a homozygosity mapping approach in 12
families from different backgrounds with CNS, Schoeb et al.8 solved
just five families by detecting homozygous mutations in NPHS1. A
more systematic search, including all known NS genes, is therefore
important for achieving a high mutation detection rate.
Although large deletions of genomic DNA have not previously
reported for NPHS1, NPHS2, LAMB2, PLCE1, CD2AP, MYO1E and
PTPRO, additional genetic analysis specifically looking for these may
improve mutation detection rates. Large deletions in WT1 have been
previously reported,56 but were exclusively associated with a Wilms’
tumor phenotype rather than NS.
A strategy of targeted gene sequencing for patients manifesting NS
in the first year of life in a world-wide study has previously been
reported, and noted that two-thirds of patients could be explained by
mutations in one of four genes (NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1 or LAMB2).5
In the modern era of whole-exome sequencing and targeted gene
capture and sequencing, these approaches will allow mutations in
known NS genes and novel NS genes to be detected with greater
efficiency.
In our study, which included families with CNS, infantile NS and
childhood SRNS, following molecular analysis of nine known NS
genes, mutations were detected in around 51% of cases, which is
comparable to the mutation detection rate in SRNS by other
groups.57 Cohorts of more restricted phenotypes have identified
mutations B80% of cases (non-Finnish CNS) by a systematic
screen of implicated genes.46 Our mutation detection rate was, as
one might predict, higher in patients where there was evidence of
familial disease (41 affected member; 75%) than in single individuals
with NS (43%).
Mutations in NPHS2 gene are the most frequent identified genetic
cause of NS in our Saudi Arabian cohort, accounting for 44% of all
pathogenic mutations detected, in comparison with B40% of a
European cohort,5 and B30% in a large Turkish study.58 Common
NPHS2 mutations in our cohort included missense mutations
V260E and V180M. All cases with mutations in NPHS2 presented
with childhood SRNS, except one family (F3) that had CNS
in association with a NPHS2 R168H mutation. All mutations
detected in NPHS2 were homozygous, consistent with parental
consanguinity in these cases.
NPHS1 mutations were detected, as expected, mainly in patients
presenting with CNS patients. One case presented with childhood
SRNS.
In PLCE1 gene, we found one mutation common to four families
with NS patients. Each of these families were descendants from large
Saudi Arabian tribes. In Saudi Arabia, eight tribes account for around
10% of the country’s population. The association of the Q1020X in
PLCE1 with the intronic variant (c.4665 þ 52G4C) in PLCE1 in each
of these cases may indicate a founder effect (Table 4).
The original description of MYO1E mutations identified just two
consanguineous families with missense mutations A159P and non￾sense mutation Y695X, originating from Italy and Turkey, respec￾tively.31 No mutations in MYO1E were identified in a screen of
sporadic cases of FSGS,31 suggesting that MYO1E is an uncommon
cause of NS, but its true incidence, especially in populations of high
consanguinity has yet to be determined There have been no other
reports of MYO1E mutations to date. Here, by identifying two novel
MYO1E mutations in an Arabic consanguineous population, we
confirm the pathogenicity of MYO1E in NS and expand the
spectrum of mutations in this rare cause of NS.
Most of the mutations previously reported in the CD2AP gene have
been heterozygous changes, except in one case with biopsy proven
FSGS where a homozygous mutation was found.26 In our cohort, we
identified a single patient from a consanguineous family harboring a
compound heterozygous mutation (F220L/T374A) in the CD2AP
gene. In a previously published cohort of 35 families with SRNS in
whom NPHS1, NPHS2 and PLCE1 mutations had been previously

excluded, no CD2AP mutations were identified, confirming their
rarity.59
We found one case (S3), presenting as SRNS, where a previously
reported homozygous mutation (c.515delCCA) in NPHS142 was
associated with a heterozygous missense change (c.761G4T;
C254F) in NPHS2. This emphasizes the need to screen multiple
NS-associated genes, even within a consanguineous pedigree, to
determine modifier gene effects. The presence of triallelism in NS
has been noted before44,45,60 and additional alleles in NS genes may
modify the renal phenotype and the clinical presentation and course.
Weber et al.49 described a child with CNS in whom a combination of
a heterozygous de novo splice mutation in NPHS1 and a homozygous
NPHS2 R138Q mutation was detected.
We were extremely careful not to define all the variants we have
detected as pathogenic mutations, although many of them were found
in o1% of our normal controls. With each new variant, we carefully
checked for the presence of additional mutations (in the same and
other NS-associated genes) and confirmed the variant co-segregated,
where parental samples were available, with clinical status within the
family. As an example, the P264R variant we observed in NPHS1
(Table 5) has previously been implicated as pathogenic in cases of
severe CNS,44 however, in a more recent paper it has been classified as a
polymorphism.46 Often novel (heterozygous) sequence variants were
also detected in our ethnically matched control population (Table 4).
We also note that the high rate of consanguineous marriage may
make it difficult to estimate pathogenicity of novel mutations without
segregation and extended family analysis. However, in silico tools have
been used to identify pathogenicity of each of our novel mutations
(Table 3).
In families with sporadic NS, the cause of the NS may not be
genetic, and screening sporadic cases for known disease genes
typically yields fewer results.58 Causes of sporadic NS are likely to
be a combination of environmental factors together with genetic
susceptibility factors.
The molecular genetic diagnosis of NS remains a vital aid to the
clinical management of families with NS. It allows for the appropriate
long-term management to be undertaken, genetic counseling to be
undertaken and where necessary, screening of siblings and other at
risk family members. Decisions regarding immunosuppression and
transplantation are aided by a molecular genetic diagnosis. It is well
recognized that children with causative mutations in NS genes do not
respond well to treatment with corticosteroids and other
immunosuppressants.5
In conclusion, in a Saudi Arabian cohort, 51% of families with NS
were explained by mutations on five known NS genes (NPHS1,
NPHS2, PLCE1, MYO1E and CD2AP). NPHS2 gene mutations were
the most common molecular genetic cause of NS in this cohort.
Unsolved patients from consanguineous families suggest additional
novel genetic causes of NS are likely. The genetic heterogeneity of NS,
suggests that screening strategies should continue to include multiple
NS genes, including rare and recently discovered genetic causes, to
allow a high yield of molecular genetic diagnoses. This will then lead
to improvements in both precise diagnosis and clinical management.
