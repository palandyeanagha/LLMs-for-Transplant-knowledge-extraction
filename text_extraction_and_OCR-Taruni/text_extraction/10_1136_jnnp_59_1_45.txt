Abstract
A cluster of cases of familial amyloid polyneuropathy has been
described in Donegal, north west Ireland. Two patients from this
region have been shown to have the ala 60 mutation in the
transthyretin gene. Three kindreds with this mutation have also
been described in the United States. Genealogical and haplotype


studies indicate that all known patients with this mutation are
related and are descended from a founder in north west Ireland.
There is evidence for reduced penetrance of this disorder. A
population based study showed that 1.1% of the population in this
area in north west Ireland carry the mutation. This has implications
in terms of diagnosis, genetic counselling, and treatment in the
future.
