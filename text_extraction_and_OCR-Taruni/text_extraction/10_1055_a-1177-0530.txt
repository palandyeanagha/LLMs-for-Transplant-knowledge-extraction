ABSTRACT
The present, updated document describes the fourth itera￾tion of recommendations for the hepatic use of contrast en￾hanced ultrasound (CEUS), first initiated in 2004 by the Euro￾pean Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and
Biology (EFSUMB). The previous updated editions of the
guidelines reflected changes in the available contrast agents
and updated the guidelines not only for hepatic but also for
non-hepatic applications.
The 2012 guideline requires updating as previously the differ￾ences of the contrast agents were not precisely described and
the differences in contrast phases as well as handling were not
clearly indicated. In addition, more evidence has been pub￾lished for all contrast agents. The update also reflects the
most recent developments in contrast agents, including the
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
as well as the extensive Asian experience, to produce a truly
international perspective.
These guidelines and recommendations provide general
advice on the use of ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) and
are intended to create standard protocols for the use and ad￾ministration of UCA in liver applications on an international
basis to improve the management of patients.
Introduction
The present, updated document describes the fourth iteration of re￾commendations for the hepatic use of contrast enhanced ultrasound
(CEUS), which was initiated by the European Federation of Societies
for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) [1]. The previous
updated editions of the guidelines reflected changes in the available
ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) and updated the guidelines not
only for hepatic but also non-hepatic applications [2–5].
The 2012 guideline requires updating as previously the differ￾ences of the contrast agents were not precisely described, evi￾dence based recommendations not given and the differences in
contrast phases as well as handling were not clearly indicated. In
addition, more evidence has been published for all contrast
agents. This update also reflects the most recent developments
in contrast agents, including the US Food and Drug Administra￾tion (FDA) approval as well as the extensive Asian experience, to
produce a truly international perspective.
The requirement for worldwide guidelines on the use of CEUS
in the liver instigated the World Federation for Ultrasound in Med￾icine and Biology (WFUMB) to facilitate discussions, in conjunc￾tion with its component Federations, namely the Asian Federation
of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (AFSUMB),
American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), Australasian
Society for Ultrasound in Medicine (ASUM), Federation of Latin

America Ultrasound (FLAUS) and EFSUMB and in collaboration
with the International Contrast Ultrasound Society (ICUS), to bring
the 2012 liver guidelines up-to-date, recognizing the fact that
UCAs are now licensed in increasing parts of the world. Of the
38 authors, 19 were from 9 European countries representing
EFSUMB, 13 from China, Japan, Korea and India representing
AFSUMB, 5 from the USA representing AIUM, and 1 from MASU
and FLAUS.
As for the previous guidelines, this document is based on com￾prehensive literature surveys, including results from prospective
clinical trials. We followed an EFSUMB Policy Document on devel￾opment strategy for clinical practice guidelines, position state￾ments and technological reviews adopted by WFUMB [6]. For
each key topic, the authors performed a systematic literature
search based on an explicit search strategy using Medline, Co￾chrane library and, if appropriate, further defined databases/sour￾ces. The search strategy was predefined with regard to sources
(e. g. Medline), inclusion criteria (e. g. language of the publication,
time period, study type, full publication), exclusion criteria and
search terms. The evidence used to substantiate recommenda￾tions were summarized in evidence tables including information
on study type (e. g. systematic review and meta-analysis, RCT,
prospective/ retrospective cohort study with defined outcome
parameters, case series), case numbers, important outcomes
and limitations. On topics where no significant study data were
available, evidence was obtained from expert committee reports
or was based on the consensus of experts in the field of ultrasound
(US) and CEUS during the consensus conferences. Recommenda￾tions have been prepared in task force groups and finally discus￾sed and voted on in a meeting of CEUS experts held in Granada
in June 2019. Level of evidence (LoE) was assigned to recommen￾dations based on evidence tables.
This joint effort has again resulted in simultaneous publication
in the official journals of WFUMB and EFSUMB (i. e., Ultrasound in
Medicine and Biology and Ultraschall in der Medizin/European
Journal of Ultrasound).
These guidelines and recommendations provide general advice
on the use of UCAs. They are intended to create standard proto￾cols for the use and administration of UCAs in liver applications on
an international basis, and improve the management of patients.
Individual cases must be managed on the basis of all clinical data
available.
World-wide commercial availability
of Ultrasound Contrast agents
Availability of UCA for clinical use is based on the approval by
regulatory agencies specific to the territory of intended use. Cur￾rently there are four agents that are available internationally for
the use in the liver, listed here with their manufacturers.
▪ Definity/Luminity – Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc., North
Billerica, MA, US
▪ SonoVue/Lumason – Bracco Suisse SA, Geneva, Switzerland
▪ Optison – GE Healthcare AS, Oslo, Norway
▪ Sonazoid – GE Healthcare AS, Oslo, Norway
The approval of these agents varies throughout the world along
with the approved indications. ICUS in collaboration with WFUMB
has developed an interactive map (▶ Fig. 1).
Indications, contraindications,
safety considerations
The indications and contraindications are different among differ￾ent UCAs; detailed information can be found in the official pack￾age insert of the drug.
Safety considerations
UCAs can be administered safely in various applications with mini￾mal risk to patients [4, 7–11]. They are not excreted through the
kidneys and can be safely administered to patients with renal
insufficiency with no risk of contrast-related nephropathy or
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. There is no additional need for bio￾chemical assessment or fasting prior to injection, and there is no
evidence of any effect on thyroid function, as UCAs do not contain
iodine [2, 3]. UCAs have a very low rate of anaphylactoid-type re￾actions (1/7000 patients, corresponding to 14/100 000, or
0.014 %) [7, 11–13] significantly lower than the rate with current
iodinated computed tomography (CT) agents (35–95/100 000
patients, 0.035–0.095 %) [14] and gadolinium-based contrast
agents at 4/64 (6.3 5) [15]. Serious anaphylactoid-type reactions
to UCAs are observed in approximately 1/10 000 exposures,
0.01 % [5, 11].
SonoVue data pooled from 75 completed studies (of 6307 pa￾tients) in Europe, North America and Asia showed that the most
frequent adverse events were headache (2.1 %), nausea (0.9 %),
chest pain (0.8 %), and chest discomfort (0.5 %). All other adverse
events occurred at a frequency of less than 0.5 % [16]. Most
adverse events were mild and resolved spontaneously within a
short time without sequelae. Most cases of allergy-like events
and hypotension occurred within a few minutes following injec￾tion of the agent. The overall reported rate of fatalities attributed
to SonoVue, is low (14/2447 083 exposed patients; 0.0006 %) and
compares favorably with the risk for fatal events reported for iodi￾nated contrast agents (approximately 0.001 %). In all reported
fatalities after use of an UCA, in both cardiac and non-cardiac
cases, an underlying patient medical circumstance played a major
role in the fatal outcome.
The intravesical administration of UCAs has been evaluated in a
total of 7082 children described in 15 studies and in a European
survey of 4131 children with 0.8 % reported adverse events, most￾ly related to bladder catheterization [17, 18]. Intravenous CEUS is
also used in the pediatric population [19] and in numerous other
documented areas [5]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
in the United States of America (USA) recently approved the use
of Lumason for pediatric liver imaging [20], which is an important
development. This application is, however, still off label in pedia￾tric imaging in many countries. A significant reduction of ionizing
radiation exposure is likely to be achieved in many areas by using
CEUS in pediatric patients [19, 21].

Liver CEUS: Scanning technique and basic
image interpretation
The study procedure is well documented in previous CEUS Guide￾lines [2, 3] and has been described in detail in a recent WFUMB
position paper [23]. Prior to performing a liver CEUS study, it is
necessary to review the patient’s clinical history, laboratory data
and any prior imaging findings [2, 3].

developed an interactive map on the approval status of contrast agents. An updated version of this map can be found online (http://icus-society.org).

Study procedure
Before CEUS, cysts and calcifications must be identified by con￾ventional US, since these structures do not exhibit contrast en￾hancement and could therefore be erroneously interpreted as a
malignant infiltration if only scanned in the late phase (LP). When
cysts are missed by the baseline examination, it is necessary to
carefully review both the contrast and the reference image, and
to analyze the B-mode pattern of the liver tissue after the disap￾pearance of the microbubbles.
Image interpretation
CEUS of the liver has three overlapping vascular phases after
the injection of UCA, because of the dual blood supply of the liver,
i. e. hepatic artery and portal vein (respectively 25 %–30 % and 70 %–
75 % of liver blood flow in non-cirrhotic conditions) (▶ Table 1).
▪ The arterial phase (AP) provides information on the degree and
pattern of the arterial vascular supply of a focal liver lesion
(FLL). Early arterial enhancement pattern and vascular archi￾tecture are best seen in slow replay of a stored cine loop.
▪ The portal venous phase (PVP) represents the arrival of UCA
through the portal system, resulting in diffuse and maximal
enhancement of normal liver parenchyma.
▪ The late phase (LP) lasts until the clearance of the UCA from
the circulation and depends on the type and dose of UCA, total
scanning time, acoustic power output and on the sensitivity of
the US system.
▪ The post-vascular phase is only observed with Sonazoid and
represents uptake of the UCA by phagocytotic cells, e. g. Kupf￾fer cells.
Slight/moderate variations of timing may occur, particularly in the
case of cardiac dysfunction and in patients with vascular liver disease.
Vascular architecture and phase-specific contrast enhance￾ment of the lesion compared to the adjacent liver parenchyma
are the most important diagnostic features for the characteriza￾tion of FLLs [2, 3].
Differences between CEUS and other contrast￾enhanced imaging modalities (CECT, CEMRI)
UCAs comprise gas-filled particles (microbubbles) and differ in
fundamental respects from the agents used in contrast enhanced
CT (CECT) and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(CEMRI), and for this reason play a complementary problem-sol￾ving role for indeterminate FLLs. Unlike CT and MR agents, micro￾bubbles are not excreted by the kidneys. With the exception of
Sonazoid, UCAs are purely intravascular agents. Therefore, CEUS
should be considered as the first contrast imaging modality in
patients with renal insufficiency. UCAs can be safely administra￾ted more than once during the same examination. While the
dynamic phases of liver enhancement with UCA resemble those
of CECT with iodinated agents and CEMRI with gadolinium che￾lates, imaging is real-time with US. Other important differences
exist and are well described in the literature [24–27]. For FLL char￾acterization, an overall improvement in sensitivity and specificity
is found for CEUS over CECT [28–33]. CEUS, in addition, is report￾ed to be invaluable in providing characterization of indeterminate
FLL on CT, MR imaging and positron emission tomography (PET)
[34–36]. It is also reported that CEUS should be the subsequent
imaging modality for all CT- and MR-indeterminate nodules be￾fore biopsy is undertaken [37].
RECOMMENDATION 4
CEUS is recommended in patients with inconclusive findings
at CT or MR imaging (LoE 2, strong recommendation)
(Pro 30, Abs 0, Against 1).
RECOMMENDATION 5
CEUS should be considered as first contrast imaging modality
in patients with renal insufficiency (LoE 5, strong recommen￾dation) (Pro 31, Abs 0, Against 0).
Detection of malignant FLL: Transabdominal
approach
Conventional US is the most frequently used modality for the pri￾mary imaging of abdominal organs, including the liver, but is less
sensitive in the detection of FLL than CECT, CEMRI or intraopera￾tive US. A number of studies [38–47] have reported that CEUS has
a considerably higher sensitivity of up to 80 %-90 % in detecting
liver metastases, comparable to that of CECT [48] and CEMRI
[40]. Furthermore, some reports have shown that CEUS is of
particular usefulness with metastases ≤ 10 mm [49, 50]. CEUS
has dramatically increased the capability of US for detection of
FLL and has the potential to be incorporated into the diagnostic
algorithm for malignant FLL.
Study procedures
The study procedure is described above. A second contrast
administration (reinjection technique) can be used to confirm the
metastatic nature of focal areas of contrast washout by demon￾strating AP enhancement within the areas of contrast washout.

Guidelines & Recommendations

Detection of metastatic lesions
The typical and almost invariable appearance of metastases is fo￾cal contrast washout. The enhancement patterns observed during
the AP has limited clinical utility in lesion detection [2, 3, 23].
With vascular phase agents (SonoVue/Lumason, Definity/
Luminity, Optison), several studies have shown that the accuracy in
the detection of liver metastases is comparable to that of CECT and
CEMRI, when scanning conditions allow a complete imaging of all liv￾er segments [44]. However, it should be noted that most of the stud￾ies have used initial and/or follow-up imaging (mostly CT examina￾tions and sometimes MR imaging, and intra-operative US) as a
reference standard, and very few reports include histologic or patho￾logic confirmation. Nonetheless, as CT and MR imaging are currently
the modalities of choice for metastatic FLL detection, comparison of
CEUS with these techniques seems reasonable in evaluating the diag￾nostic efficacy of CEUS. In addition, histologic confirmation of every
malignant FLL in patients with clear imaging diagnosis might not be
ethically appropriate. According to a meta-analysis including 828 me￾tastases from 18 studies, overall sensitivity of CEUS for diagnosis of
metastases was 91 % (95 % CI: 87–95 %) [30].
RECOMMENDATION 6
CEUS can be used for liver metastases detection as part of
multimodality imaging approach (LoE 2, weak recommenda￾tion) (Pro 31, 0 Abs, 0 Against).
Detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC)
With all UCAs, most HCC show AP hyperenhancement (APHE), but
the short duration of APHE makes adequate assessment of the
whole liver impracticable. The LP lasts long enough for a detailed
examination, but the appearances of HCC are variable. Important￾ly, not all HCCs demonstrate contrast washout in the LP, limiting
the sensitivity of CEUS for HCC detection. CEUS for staging of
HCC is not recommended except for patients with portal vein tu￾mor thrombus [51, 52].
With the post-vascular phase UCA (Sonazoid), scanning the en￾tire liver at 10min or later after injection helps to detect malignant
nodules since typical HCC shows as an enhancement defect [53–
58]. However, approximately half of well differentiated HCCs do
not show enhancement defects in the post-vascular phase [124].
ICCs behave in virtually the same manner as metastases, wash￾ing out rapidly and appearing as defects in the LP, regardless of
the appearance in the AP [59]. This pattern may facilitate detec￾tion of satellite nodules adjacent to a larger lesion that were not
visualized on conventional US.
RECOMMENDATION 7
Routine use of CEUS for the surveillance of patients at risk for
HCC is not recommended (LoE 4, strong recommendation)
(Pro 29, Against 2, Abs 0).
RECOMMENDATION 8
Routine use of CEUS for staging of HCC is not recommended
(LoE 2, strong recommendation), (Pro 31, Against 0, Abs 0).
CEUS for characterization of focal liver lesions
Before starting liver CEUS, it is necessary to review the patient’s
clinical history, laboratory data and any prior imaging. The entire
liver and the FLL should be interrogated using conventional
B-Mode and color Doppler US in order to obtain reproducible in￾formation regarding segmental localization, size and relation to
vessels and other anatomical landmarks as well as to guarantee
optimal examination quality and ascertain whether underlying
cirrhosis is present. The range of tumor types differs between cir￾rhotic and non-cirrhotic livers, with description of the characteri￾zation of FLL discussed separately for each.
RECOMMENDATION 9
Before performing CEUS to characterize FLLs, it is recommen￾ded to perform a systematic liver examination using B-Mode
and Doppler US (LoE 5, strong recommendation) (Pro 32,
Abs 0, Against 0).
Characterization of FLL in the non-cirrhotic
liver
The probability of a FLL being benign (including inflammatory) or
malignant depends on the symptoms and past medical history. An
incidentally detected FLL in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic
persons is likely benign [60, 61], whereas with pre-existing malig￾nant disease, the probability of malignancy is significantly higher
[1]. In patients with supportive symptomatology, FLLs may raise
suspicion for phlegmonous inflammation or abscess formation.
The primary aim of CEUS in patients with a non-cirrhotic liver is
to differentiate benign from malignant FLLs [29, 33, 45, 56–58,
62–78]. Thus, CEUS is useful to facilitate the clinical decision as
to whether a sonographically detected liver lesion needs further
investigation or surgery [79].
RECOMMENDATION 10
CEUS is recommended as the first-line imaging technique for
the characterization of incidentally detected, indeterminate
FLL at US in patients with non-cirrhotic liver and without a his￾tory or clinical suspicion of malignancy (LoE 1, strong recom￾mendation) (Pro 30, Abs 2, Against 0).

RECOMMENDATION 11
CEUS is suggested as the first-line imaging technique for the
characterization of FLL detected with US in patients with
non-cirrhotic liver with a history or clinical suspicion of malig￾nant disease (LoE 2, weak recommendation) (Pro 31, Abs 0,
Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 12
CEUS is recommended for the characterization of FLL in the
non-cirrhotic liver in patients with inconclusive findings at CT
or MR imaging (LoE 2, strong recommendation) and is sug￾gested if biopsy of the FLL was inconclusive (LoE 5, weak
recommendation) (Pro 30, Abs 0, Against 1).
RECOMMENDATION 13
CEUS is recommended to characterize FLL in the non-cirrhotic
liver if both CT and MR imaging are contraindicated (LoE 5,
strong recommendation) (Pro 32, Abs 0, Against 0).
For differential diagnosis of FLL, CEUS is superior to CT and equiva￾lent to MR imaging [30, 33, 45, 64, 68]. CEUS has been shown to
be the most cost effective imaging modality in some countries in
Europe [80].
Benign solid FLLs
In addition to contrast enhancement of the FLL compared to the
adjacent tissue, vascular architecture during AP can further
characterize FLL. The enhancement patterns are summarized in
▶ Table 2.
Hemangioma
After focal fatty sparing, hemangioma is the second most com￾mon benign solid lesion of the liver [61, 81]. In asymptomatic pa￾tients with a normal appearing liver on US and without findings or
history of malignant or chronic liver disease, a well-circumscribed,
round-shaped hyperechoic and homogeneous FLL < 30 mm with￾out intralesional vessels at color Doppler and without halo sign is
diagnostic of hemangioma. CEUS or other contrast-enhanced
imaging modalities are not recommended for further characteri￾zation [82, 83]. CEUS is indicated when a definitive diagnosis of a
hemangioma cannot be achieved using conventional US, as the
addition of CEUS markedly improves the diagnostic accuracy in
90–95 % of cases [29, 66, 76].
The typical CEUS feature of a hemangioma is peripheral, dis￾continuous nodular (syn.: globular) enhancement in the AP with
progressive centripetal partial or complete fill-in [84–87]. Com￾plete fill-in occurs only in 40–50 % cases during the LP. This fill￾ing-in is often more rapid in smaller lesions and the entire lesion
may be hyperenhancing in the AP. Persistent iso- or hyperen￾hancement is sustained through the LP [76, 88–92]. On post-vas￾cular imaging using Sonazoid, hemangiomas appear iso- to hy￾poenhancing relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma, and
may resemble metastatic tumors and HCCs [93, 94]. Overall
sensitivity of CEUS for diagnosis of haemangioma is 86 % (95 %
CI: 81–92 %) according to a meta-analysis including 612 cases
from 20 studies [30].
Atypical appearances, in particular LP hypoenhancement (UCA
washout) or lack of centripetal fill-in, have been described and
may be explained by the destruction of microbubbles that are
not adequately replenished due to very long bubble transit times
within the lesion [95]. Hemangiomas with arteriovenous shunts
(also called high flow or shunt hemangiomas) show rapid homo￾geneous hyperenhancement in the AP and therefore can be con￾fused with focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), or even with hepato￾cellular adenomas (HCA) or HCCs [76]. They are almost always
hyperenhancing in the PVP and LP. Thrombosed hemangiomas
show lack of enhancement and can be confused with malignancy
if only identified during the later CEUS phases [76, 96].
Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)
On CEUS, FNH typically appears as a hyperenhancing homoge￾neous lesion in all phases. The hyperenhancement might be only
mild during the PVP and LP [67, 77, 97–100]. Hyperenhancement
is usually marked in the AP [100], with a rapid fill-in from the cen￾ter outwards (a spoke-wheel pattern) (70 %) or sometimes with an
eccentric vascular or multilocular arterial supply (30 %) [77, 84]. A
centrally hypo- or non-enhancing located scar may be seen in the
LP. This, together with the direction of filling of the lesion in the
AP if recognizable (centrifugal vs. centripetal), is an important fea￾ture to distinguish FNH from shunt (high-flow) hemangiomas. In
distinction to an FNH, HCA and a hypervascular malignant FLL
show washout as the most important CEUS feature [90].
In the vast majority of cases (93.5 %) iso- or only slight hyper￾enhancement of FNH is observed in post-vascular phase compar￾ed with the surrounding liver parenchyma, whereas in the remain￾der (6.5 %) hypoenhancement is observed [101, 102].
Overall sensitivity of CEUS for diagnosis of FNH is 88 % (95 % CI:
81–94 %) according to a large meta-analysis of 365 FNH from
18 studies [30]. Several studies have suggested that diagnostic
accuracy of CEUS for diagnosis of FNH is a “matter of size”, with
accuracy decreasing in patients with lesion size > 30 mm [2, 3].
Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA)
HCA is a rare benign and sometimes estrogen-dependent hepatic
neoplasm. Typical imaging characteristics of HCA are displayed in
smaller lesions < 50 mm [77, 90]. At CEUS, HCA shows homoge￾neous arterial hyperenhancement, typically with rapid, complete,
peripherally dominated filling without a spoke-wheel pattern and
without a peripheral globular enhancement pattern, which often
enables the correct differential diagnosis, except in telangiectatic
and inflammatory HCA [87]. However, HCCs and hyperenhancing
metastases may exhibit a similar arterial enhancement pattern,
making the differentiation impossible during the AP. In the early
PVP, HCA usually become isoenhancing or, more rarely, remain
slightly hyperenhancing [77, 97]. Previous bleeding episodes or

necrotic portions exhibit intratumoral nonenhancing areas in lar￾ger HCA. In most cases, washout occurs in the LP requiring biopsy
to exclude malignancy [90]. Due to the different sub-types of
HCA, characterization and differentiation (for example from FNH
and HCC such as inflammatory subtype) may be difficult using
CEUS as well as MRI and biopsy (HCA < 50 mm) or surgery (≥ 50)
are indicated for final diagnosis [91]. Liver-specific contrast-en￾hanced MRI may be helpful when HCA is suspected at CEUS to ex￾clude multilocularity. No studies are available for the diagnosis of
HCA using Sonazoid.
Focal fatty change
Focal fatty changes, either by fat infiltration or fatty sparing are
usually shown on conventional B-Mode US as oval or polygonal
areas located along the portal bifurcation or close to the hepatic
hilum and gallbladder. On visualization of possible focal fat infil￾tration, atypical location or history of malignancy should prompt
further characterization to exclude malignant lesions. Focal fatty
change shows the same degree of enhancement (isoenhancing)
as the surrounding liver parenchyma during all phases [92, 103].
Typically, a centrally located artery can be identified [82, 92, 104].
Infection
The CEUS findings in phlegmonous inflammation are variable.
During the early stage of infection, lesions often appear hyperen￾hancing, while mature lesions develop non-enhancing foci as li￾quefaction progresses. Mature liver abscesses on CEUS show en￾hancement of the margins and frequently of the septae in the
AP, which sometimes can be followed by PVP hypoenhancement.
The most prominent feature on CEUS is the nonenhancement of
the liquefied portions combined with arterial rim enhancement
[105–109]. Diffuse hyperenhancement of the affected liver sub-

segment(s) in the AP and LP washout of liver parenchyma sur￾rounding the nonenhancing necrotic area have been described in
the majority of cases [109].
The appearances of granulomas and focal tuberculosis on CEUS
are variable, which make it hard and sometimes impossible to dif￾ferentiate these from malignancy [107, 110–112].
Other solid benign liver lesions
A range of other, very rare, solid benign liver lesions can be seen
including the following entities:
▪ Active hemorrhage (including spontaneous, traumatic and
iatrogenic liver bleedings) demonstrates contrast extravasa￾tion whereas hematomas appear as non-enhancing areas.
▪ Inflammatory pseudotumor is a rare disease whose definite
diagnosis is usually only made at surgery. It may show arterial
enhancement and LP hypoenhancement, falsely suggesting
malignancy.
▪ Hepatic angiomyolipoma is a rare benign mesenchymal tumor.
It appears homogeneous in most cases and strongly hypere￾chogenic at baseline US. CEUS shows arterial hyperenhance￾ment [76, 113].
▪ Cholangiocellular adenomas (CCA or bile duct adenoma) are
rare lesions that are usually small (90 % < 1 cm). CEUS may
show strong arterial hyperenhancement and early washout in
the PVP and LP (they lack portal veins), falsely suggesting
malignancy [114, 115].
▪ Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) often
manifests as multinodular FLL. On CEUS, HEHE shows rim-like
or heterogeneous hyperenhancement in the AP and hypoen￾hancement in the PVP and LP, a sign of malignancy [96, 116,
117]. Some patients show centrally located unenhanced areas.
In contrast, all hemangioma and FNH show hyper- or isoen￾hancement in the PVP and LP, which is their most distinguish￾ing feature.
For liver trauma we refer to the recently published EFSUMB Guide￾lines and Recommendations for the Clinical Practice of Contrast￾Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in Non-Hepatic Applications: Update
2017 [4, 5].
Malignant solid FLLs
In patients with a non-cirrhotic liver, metastases are more com￾mon than primary liver malignant tumors, though conventional
US is occasionally helpful to show the malignant nature of an FLL,
by demonstrating a hypoechoic halo and infiltration of intrahepa￾tic vessels. Contrast enhanced imaging is necessary to determine
the malignant nature under many circumstances, which is true for
US, CT and MRI [45, 118]. Contrast washout in the PVP and LP is
the most important feature to determine malignancy [2, 3].
Almost all metastases show this feature, regardless of the
enhancement pattern in the AP. Very few exceptions to this rule
have been reported, mainly in liver metastases of neuroendocrine
tumors and atypical HCC (▶ Table 3).
Hepatocellular carcinoma in the non-cirrhotic liver
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liv￾er malignancy and most of the patients are at risk with known or
unknown liver cirrhosis [119]. There is little literature on the value
of CEUS in the diagnosis of HCC in the non-cirrhotic liver. General￾ly, the enhancement patterns of HCC in the non-cirrhotic liver on
CEUS are similar to HCC in the cirrhotic liver, but size at time of
diagnosis tends to be larger [60]. HCA and FNH are the main dif-

ferential diagnoses [90, 120]. HCC in the non-cirrhotic liver are
usually hyperenhancing in the AP, typically with a chaotic vascular
pattern [121] and variably iso- or hypoenhancing in the PVP and
LP [88]. Hyperenhancement in the AP is often homogenous but
starts predominantly along the periphery [122]. The fibrolamellar
variant of HCC has nonspecific appearances at CEUS. According to
expert opinions and case reports, they show rapid wash-in with a
heterogeneous pattern in the AP and early PVP and early and
marked washout thereafter [123, 124].
Cholangiocarcinoma
(intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma, ICC)
ICC is the second most common primary malignant liver tumor
and usually arises in healthy liver parenchyma. The different treat￾ment approaches and prognosis, necessitate that ICC is distin￾guished from HCC [125]. Although rarely observed in Europe and
America, more frequently seen in Asia, where combined HCC-ICC
also exists [126].
In distinction to the late enhancement on CECT or CEMRI, ICC
has a variety of patterns in the AP at CEUS but all show washout in
the LP [59, 113, 127]. The typical pattern of malignancy is better
displayed by CEUS than by CECT or CEMRI [128, 129].
There is controversy on the differential diagnosis of HCC and
ICC with CEUS [35, 52, 93, 130–137]. Compared to HCC, ICC
shows a less intense enhancement in the AP and shows early
(< 60 seconds) and marked washout compared to a typically late
and mild washout in HCC [93]. ICC can be subcategorized into
three types: mass-forming, periductal infiltrating, and intraductal
growing. Mass-forming ICC can exhibit four enhancement pat￾terns in the AP; peripheral irregular rim-like enhancement, het￾erogeneous hyperenhancement, homogeneous hyperenhance￾ment, and heterogeneous hypoenhancement [113, 127]. Mass￾forming ICC usually shows washout in PVP and invariably shows
marked hypoenhancement in the LP followed by complete hy￾poenhancement in the postvascular phase [53, 138].
During the AP, periductal infiltrating ICCs appear heteroge￾neously enhancing, intraductal growing ICCs exhibit homoge￾neous hyper-enhancement in most cases. Both lesions show
marked washout during PVP and LP [138].
Metastases
Liver metastases are the most common malignant lesions of liver,
arising mainly from cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, breast,
pancreas or lung. CEUS markedly improves the detection of liver
metastases compared to conventional US. Liver metastases can
be detected and characterized reliably as hypoenhancing lesions
during the PVP and LP, with few exceptions. Washout is of marked
degree and with early onset, usually before 60 sec after UCA injec￾tion. In the LP, very small metastases may be conspicuous and
lesions that were occult on B-Mode US can be detected [45]. Due
to lack of Kupffer cells, metastatic lesions on post-vascular phase
imaging with Sonazoid are clearly demarcated and completely hy￾poenhancing [53, 136, 137, 139–141].
Metastases usually show at least some contrast enhancement
in the AP, exhibiting sometimes a marked and chaotic enhance￾ment. Rim or halo enhancement is often seen [2, 3].
Lymphoma
Lymphoma shows variable arterial enhancement but characteris￾tic fast and marked washout in the PVP and LP, predictive of
malignancy [87, 142, 143].
Focal cystic liver lesions (benign and malignant)
Focal cystic liver lesions (FCLL) represent a wide spectrum of be￾nign and malignant disease [114]. Benign FCLL include simple
cysts, hematoma and hemorrhagic hepatic cysts [144, 145],
abscess, bilomas, hydatid cysts [146], cystic cavernous hemangio￾mas [147] and cystic HCA and other rare entities [86, 148]. Malig￾nant FCLL include cystic HCC [149], cystic lymphoma, cystic me￾tastases as typically seen in neuroendocrine tumors [150] and
other rare entities.
Simple cysts are completely non-enhancing on CEUS, and
CEUS is not indicated for assessment of simple cysts but useful to
evaluate complicated or atypical cysts [145].
With complex cystic masses, CEUS characterizes the vascular
flow within septa in cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma [1,
151]. Such septa are often visualized by US but not by CT and
MRI. Some atypical cystic lesions may have a solid appearance at
conventional US, thus mimicking a malignant lesion, particularly a
cystic metastasis or biliary cystadenocarcinoma [1, 32].
The CEUS distinguishing feature in the differential diagnosis of
hepatic cystadenoma (HBCA) from hepatic cystadenocarcinoma
(HBCAC) is the honeycomb septal hyperenhancement during the
AP for HBCA, and hypoenhancement during the PVP and LP for
HBCAC [1].
RECOMMENDATION 14
If CEUS has definitively characterized a benign FLL, further
investigations are not recommended to confirm the diagnosis
(LoE 1, strong recommendation) (Pro 26, Abs 5, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 15
CEUS can be used to characterize hepatic abscess in the
appropriate clinical setting (LoE 2, weak recommendation)
(Pro 24, Abs 2, Against 1).
CEUS for characterization of FLLs
in liver cirrhosis
Study procedure
In addition to the general recommendations for the study of FLL,
important aspects should be followed if the liver is cirrhotic. Since
the AP is crucial to observe for characterization of FLL in cirrhosis,
good visualization of the nodule is important. Despite the use of a
low MI, microbubbles can be disrupted and acoustic output power
should then be reduced, while maintaining sufficient signal intensi￾Dietrich CF et al. Guidelines and Good… Ultraschall in Med 2020; 41: 562–585 | © 2020. Thieme. All rights reserved. 571

ty to allow contrast persistence until the very LP (beyond 3–4 min￾utes); crucial for detecting washout and establishing a diagnosis of
HCC. Furthermore, when the arterial/early PVP is complete (after
60 seconds), it is recommended to image the lesion intermittently
(usually brief scan every 30 to 60 seconds), rather than continuous￾ly, to minimize microbubble destruction that may cause problems
in the identification of subtle or late washout.
Image interpretation and evaluation
The key feature for the diagnosis of HCC in liver cirrhosis is AP hy￾perenhancement (APHE), followed by late onset mild washout
(> 60 sec after injection) [152–156]. This pattern of washout in a
HCC is seen in more than 97 % of cases according to a large retro￾spective series [157]. Arterial hyperenhancement is usually homo￾geneous and intense in HCC, but may be inhomogeneous in larger
nodules (> 5 cm) that are necrotic. Rim enhancement is atypical for
HCC. Washout is observed overall in about half the cases of HCC,
but rarely in small nodules (20–30 % in those 1–2 cm, 40–60 % in
those 2–3 cm) [49, 132, 158]. Washout is observed more frequent￾ly in HCC with poorer grades of differentiation than in well-differen￾tiated HCC, which tend to be isoenhancing in the LP [159–162]. ICC
risk is increased in patients with liver cirrhosis, but only 1–2 % of
newly detected FLL in a cirrhotic liver are ICCs [126, 163].
Hypoenhancement in the LP is usually less marked in HCC than
in other primary tumors or in liver metastases [159, 164]. Further￾more, the washout tends to start later in HCC, usually not before
60 seconds after injection [159, 164] and appearing only after
180 seconds in up to 25 % of cases [159, 164]; consequently, it is
important to observe nodules in cirrhosis until late (> 4 minutes).
Early washout (< 60 seconds) has been reported to occur in poorly
differentiated HCC or to suggest a non-hepatocellular malignancy
[159, 160, 162, 164], most often a peripheral ICC. For details
regarding the CEUS Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System
(LI-RADS) classification we refer to the published literature [52,
128, 129, 133–135, 152, 156, 165, 166]. Sensitivity of CEUS for
diagnosis of HCC is 88 % (95 % CI: 84–92 %) according to a meta￾analysis including 1333 HCCs from 19 studies [30].
RECOMMENDATION 16
CEUS can be utilized in first line to characterize FLL found in
patients with liver cirrhosis to establish a diagnosis of malig￾nancy (CEUS LR-M) or specifically of HCC (CEUS LR-5), but CT
or MR imaging remain required for accurate staging unless
contraindicated (LoE2, weak recommendation) (Pro 29,
Abs 0, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 17
CEUS can be utilized when CT or MR imaging is inconclusive,
especially in FLL in cirrhotic liver not suitable for biopsy, to as￾sess the probability of a lesion to be an HCC (LoE3, weak
recommendation) (Pro 29, Abs 0, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 18
CEUS can be utilized for the selection of FLL(s) in a cirrhotic liv￾er to be biopsied when they are multiple or have different
contrast patterns (LoE4, weak recommendation) (Pro 28,
Abs 1, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 19
CEUS can be used to monitor changes in enhancement pat￾terns in FLL in cirrhotic liver requiring follow-up (LoE4, Weak
Recommendation) (Pro 29, Abs 0, Ag 0).
Characterization of portal vein thrombosis
CEUS is superior to color Doppler US for the diagnosis of portal vein
thrombosis [167]. Acute bland thrombus is typically “avascular” and
shows as a void within the enhancing liver in all phases of CEUS but
best visualized during the PVP. A “tumor in vein” has the same
enhancement characteristics as the tumor from which it originated,
including rapid AP hyperenhancement and washout [26, 167–173].
Differential diagnosis between partially occlusive/recanalized
bland thrombus and “tumor-in-vein” is more challenging. For reli￾able differentiation, careful assessment of the arrival time of the
UCA to the vein is needed. Early arrival of UCA into the lesion in
the portal vein at about the same time as opacification of hepatic
arteries suggests tumor but this behavior is not specific to HCC.
Tumor in peripheral portal veins may be mistaken for tumor no￾dules, erroneously downstaging the patient. Avoidance is facilita￾ted by real-time imaging while sweeping through the liver, espe￾cially in the PVP, to depict the tubular configuration of the tumor
and its continuity with more central portal or hepatic veins.
The tumor source of a malignant portal vein thrombus may be
obvious, or it may be identified with the assistance of CEUS. A sus￾picious thrombus within the portal vein may be amenable to US
guided biopsy, targeting, if possible, any enhancing regions within
the thrombus [167, 169, 173, 174].
RECOMMENDATION 20
CEUS is recommended to differentiate between benign and
malignant portal vein thrombosis (LoE 2, strong recommen￾dation) (Pro 26, Abs 1, Against 0).
Contrast enhanced intraoperative ultrasound
(CE-IOUS)
Several studies using different UCAs have shown that contrast en￾hanced intraoperative US (CE-IOUS) enhances tumor detection
and allows to assess the region for resection, where previously a
pre-treatment colorectal liver metastasis was present but has re￾572 Dietrich CF et al. Guidelines and Good… Ultraschall in Med 2020; 41: 562–585 | © 2020. Thieme. All rights reserved.

gressed [175–182]. In particular it has proven valuable for the dif￾ferential diagnosis between HCC and dysplastic nodule, using
both SonoVue [176] and Sonazoid [180]. In addition, CE-IOUS
may have an important impact on surgical strategy depending
on the attitude of the surgeon [183]. The study procedure and im￾age interpretation of CE-IOUS examination are the same as for the
transabdominal approach described in the above sections [175].
The most important difference is that CE-IOUS is performed dur￾ing the surgical procedure and uses an intraoperative transducer,
which, because of its higher frequency, may require a higher UCA
dosage.
RECOMMENDATION 21
CE-IOUS can be used to detect and characterize FLLs not
detected at preoperative imaging (LoE 3, strong recommen￾dation) (Pro 27, Abs 0, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 22
CE-IOUS is recommended to assess the region for resection,
where previously a pre-treatment colorectal liver metastasis
was present but has regressed (LoE 2, strong recommenda￾tion) (Pro 27, Abs 0, Against 0).
CEUS for guiding biopsy
Ultrasound is an established technique to guide biopsy of FLLs,
with excellent safety profile and good overall accuracy [184,
185]. Ultrasound is inferior to MR and CT in detecting liver lesions,
but with CEUS the sensitivity is comparable to CECT and CEMRI,
but importantly, CEUS enables real-time guidance of the biopsy
procedure. The addition of CEUS could potentially increase the di￾agnostic outcome of percutaneous biopsies for four different rea￾sons [186–198]:
▪ Biopsy can be made from perfused areas to avoid necrosis or
avascular tissue [186–192].
▪ Biopsy can be made of poorly visualized or “invisible” lesions
on B-mode US [188–190, 193–198].
▪ Biopsy can be avoided completely if a CEUS study unequivo￾cally shows typical features of benign FLL or HCC in an appro￾priate patient population [2, 3].
▪ The combination of image fusion techniques and CEUS may
have a synergistic effect on both modalities. CEUS fusion has
been proven to visualize lesions invisible at conventional US
fusion in a substantial number of cases [197, 198].
Study procedure
Depending on the contrast agent, a two-step procedure is recom￾mended. Typically, the first UCA dose is injected to characterize
the target lesion and select a zone for biopsy; and the second
dose used for the CEUS-guided biopsy itself. Dual-screen contrast
imaging is recommended with simultaneous contrast imaging on
one side to visualize the lesion and conventional B-mode imaging
on the other to track the needle. Biopsy should be performed dur￾ing the contrast phase in which the lesion is best visualized. CEUS
prior to a suggested US-guided biopsy of a FLL can help by avoid￾ing biopsy in the case of a diagnostically unequivocal CEUS result.
Conventional unenhanced US guidance is adequate for biopsy of
most tumors detected on real-time US and there is no rationale
for substituting with CEUS-guidance for routine use.
RECOMMENDATION 23
CEUS-guidance should be attempted to biopsy FLLs that are
invisible or inconspicuous at B-mode imaging (LoE 1, strong
recommendation) (Pro 27, Abs 2, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 24
CEUS-guidance should be considered in FLLs with potential
necrotic areas or if previous biopsy resulted in necrotic mate￾rial (LoE 4, weak recommendation) (Pro 29, Abs 0, Against 0).
Intracavitary uses
Intracavitary CEUS (ICCEUS, intracavitary administration of UCAs)
is increasingly used as an adjunct to US-guided interventional
techniques [199–202]. Concepts and techniques have been pub￾lished [203–205]. Liver abscess drainage and biliary drainage pro￾cedures using ICCEUS have been described in detail. A systematic
review covering the role of CEUS in relation to percutaneous inter￾vention has been published [190].
Study procedure
The standard dosage for intracavitary CEUS is approximately 1 drop
UCA per 10 mL normal saline but may vary with the anticipated dis￾tribution volume (e. g. ascites). Higher concentrations are possible
for problem solving decisions, but accurate imaging is dependent
on correct dilution dosage; high concentrations will result in acous￾tic shadowing. Higher frequency transducers (linear, endoscopic
US) demand higher concentrations.
CEUS guided biliary interventions
CEUS-guided percutaneous cholangiography can delineate the
biliary tree via drainage catheters, T-tubes placed intraoperatively,
or during endoscopic access [206–216]. Intraoperatively,
3D-intracavitary CEUS can aid the surgeon to plan resection lines
[206–216].
Dietrich CF et al. Guidelines and Good… Ultraschall in Med 2020; 41: 562–585 | © 2020. Thieme. All rights reserved. 573

Intracavitary CEUS of the biliary tree is used
▪ during the intervention procedure
– to demonstrate puncture or cannulation success
– to evaluate for communication with other structures, e. g.
intestine [214], pleural cavity [206, 207], gall bladder,
vessels [210], abscesses or others
– to evaluate the level of obstruction [216]
▪ after the interventional procedure
– to evaluate for dislodgement or occlusion.
Importantly, intracavitary CEUS reduces or obviates radiation
exposure during the intervention. In addition, it has a positive im￾pact on patient logistics during both procedure and follow-up by
making transportation of the patient to an X-ray fluoroscopy￾room unnecessary when catheter dislodgement is suspected,
allowing bedside investigation with a portable US system.
CEUS for the abscess drainage
Image-guided liver abscess management, normally with US or CT
guidance, is a standard procedure, with advantages of both effi￾ciency and effectiveness, allowing percutaneous abscess drainage
with either a needle or catheter, with concurrent lavage [184].
During image guided intervention, correct placement of the nee￾dle or the drainage catheter can be confirmed using intracavitary
CEUS [205]. Communication with other abscess cavities or other
structures can be demonstrated or excluded (e. g. bile duct, pan￾creatic pseudocyst, peritoneal cavity, pleural space), resulting in
additional interventions in a number of instances (biliary drain￾age, pleural drainage, additional abscess interventions in complex
cases, pseudocyst intervention etc.). During follow up, the cavity
size can be evaluated, and dislodgement of a drainage catheter
can be identified or excluded [217, 218].
RECOMMENDATION 25
ICCEUS can be used for delineation of the liver abscess cavity,
identification of correct drain position and of communication
with other structures (LoE 3, weak recommendation) (Pro 28,
Abs 1, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 26
ICCEUS can be used to guide transhepatic biliary interventions
(LoE 3, weak recommendation) (Pro 27, Abs 1, Against 1).
CEUS for interventional tumor ablation
Ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging modality for
guiding ablation therapies in patients with liver tumors [219,
220]. US allows real-time precise placement of the ablation nee￾dle in any visualized target lesion. The procedure is safe, rapid
and cost-effective in comparison to other imaging modalities, al￾lowing positioning within the target in a short time [184]. The
adjunctive use of CEUS is recommended for pre-treatment evalu￾ation of the ablation target, and also for peri-procedural assess￾ment of treatment results [184, 190]. CEUS-guided ablation of liv￾er tumors may be dispensed with when the lesion target is well
recognizable at conventional B-mode US.
Pre-treatment CEUS
Pre-treatment evaluation includes assessment of ablation target
size, vascularization and tumor margins. For ablative treatment
of undetected or inconspicuous target lesions at unenhanced US,
availability of CEUS-guided technology and possibly real-time
CEUS fusion imaging is of pivotal importance [196, 221–224]. Of￾ten, two intravenous injections are required: the first to identify
the target lesion and plan treatment, the second for correct posi￾tioning of the ablation needle. For CEUS, dual screen is recom￾mended to allow the simultaneous real-time visualization of the
probe insertion with both conventional B-mode US and CEUS.
RECOMMENDATION 27
CEUS prior to US guided ablation procedure is recommended
as a complement to US, CT and MRI for treatment planning
(LoE 2, strong recommendation) (Pro 27, Abs 2, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 28
CEUS-guidance is recommended for the US guided ablation of
tumors that are invisible or inconspicuous on US (LoE 2, strong
recommendation) (Pro 27, Abs 2, Against 0).
CEUS performed 10–15 minutes after ablation treatment should
be considered for immediate evaluation of therapeutic efficacy
and for early detection of residual viable tumor, which allows for
instantaneous CEUS-guided re-ablation under the same anesthe￾sia. This technique has been proven to decrease both the number
of second ablation sessions and the tumor recurrence rate during
follow-up [225–227]. Similarly, CEUS fusion imaging with CT/MR
imaging for periprocedural assessment of ablation has been re￾ported to enable immediate repeat ablations under CEUS or
CEUS-CT/MR fusion imaging-guidance, and decrease long term
local tumor progression [228–232].
Study procedure
After cessation of ablation, a 5–10 minutes period is necessary be￾fore performing CEUS to allow the hyperechoic “cloud” of gas pro￾duced during the ablation to diffuse into tissue. In cases of resi￾dual tumor, a second CEUS injection must be used to allow
correct insertion of the ablation needle.

Guidelines & Recommendations
Downloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.

RECOMMENDATION 29
CEUS is recommended for the evaluation of the treatment ef￾fect after ablation and guidance for immediate US guided re￾treatment of residual tumor (LoE 2, strong recommendation)
(Pro 26, Abs 0, Against 2).
Post-treatment CEUS
CEUS is a reliable method for evaluation of the ablation margin
and detection of tumor recurrence, potentially reducing the num￾ber of CT examinations needed during follow-up [225, 229, 232–
239].
Follow-up CEUS
The purpose of first post-ablation CEUS is to evaluate immediate
treatment response of the target lesion (by size, perfusion, safety
margin and residual viable tumor) and to look for complications
(such as hemorrhage, hepatic infarction, bile duct dilatation,
abscess, biliary tumor, etc.) [226, 240]. Regular CEUS follow-up
weeks to months after ablation can detect local recurrence and
new lesions [190, 221, 222, 224, 239]. Frequently, more than
one injection is required to evaluate multi-ablated lesions, any
suspicious areas or new lesions.
RECOMMENDATION 30
CEUS is recommended as the priority imaging method in the
follow-up after ablation treatment to identify residual or
recurrent tumor at appropriate time intervals (LoE 2, strong
recommendation) (Pro 24, Abs 3, Ag 0).
In the early post-ablation evaluation (within the first 30 days), a
thin, uniform enhancing hyperemic rim is visible along the periph￾ery of the necrotic region, similar to the findings on CECT. Due
attention must be taken not to confuse this with recurrence.
Monitoring Medical Tumor treatment
response
Neoangiogenesis is an important target for novel anticancer
treatments and many new antiangiogenesis or antivascular treat￾ments aim at destroying or limiting the growth of tumor vessels
[241, 242]. Dynamic contrast enhanced US (DCEUS) has emerged
for monitoring the response to these drugs [243]. Initially, such
monitoring relied on qualitative analyses only. More recently, ro￾bust and quantitative features have been developed. To achieve
successful results, standardization and strict control of scanner
settings are needed [243].
Methodology and equipment for quantification
Measurements of contrast kinetics are performed using a time-in￾tensity curve (TIC) analysis of dynamic contrast enhancement.
Background subtraction is necessary to compensate for attenua￾tion effects [244] and extract reliable time-based features, such
as time to peak, mean transit time, etc. However, the nonlinear
compression applied to the original signals (required to display
them on video monitors) distorts amplitude-based TIC features
(e. g., peak intensity and area under the curve) [245]. The major￾ity of reports have used uncompressed, post beamformed data
(radio-frequency data are not required since the phase informa￾tion is not essential). TIC based on such raw data sets allow for
accurate assessment of both time-based and amplitude-depen￾dent features. All manufacturers that supply built-in analysis
packages on their scanners use this type of data but off-line soft￾ware packages are also available [246]. For details of administra￾tion of UCA and quantitative analysis we refer to the EFSUMB
position paper [243].
Assessment of antiangiogenic treatment
Since antiangiogenic treatments frequently induce necrosis with￾out causing tumor shrinkage, functional imaging techniques are
particularly suitable for the early assessment of response, a task
for which both the RECIST and World Health Organization (WHO)
size criteria [247, 248] are unsatisfactory. Studies of various types
of tumors such as HCC, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with antiangiogenic therapies
have confirmed that DCEUS may allow early prediction of re￾sponse to treatment [91, 96, 249–262]. The first multicenter
study including more than 500 patients in 19 centers [263] cor￾related DCEUS with progression free survival (PFS) and overall sur￾vival (OS). A decrease of 40 % of AUC at one month was correlated
to PFS and OS in patients treated with thyrosine kinase inhibitors
[264].
RECOMMENDATION 31
DCE-US can be used in the quantitative assessment of
response to targeted therapies in patients with malignant
tumors of the liver (LoE 2, weak recommendation) (Pro 22,
Abs 5, Against 0).
Paediatric liver lesions
Ultrasound imaging is the ideal imaging technique for many areas
in pediatrics, and should always be the first line imaging modality
whenever practicable [19]. The advantages of US are established:
it is child-friendly, easy to use in the difficult child, repeatable, and
has limited safety issues. Moreover, in liver imaging, the relatively
fat free body habitus of the child renders US an ideal technique for
assessment of FLLs. CEUS in the assessment of pediatric liver le￾sions has been investigated by a number of groups, predominant￾ly in Europe and almost exclusively using the agent SonoVue, with
some reports from North America using Definity, using these
agents off-label in children. There has been approval from the
FDA to use Lumason in the assessment of FLLs in children. This is
likely to increase the use of CEUS as a first line imaging method for
Dietrich CF et al. Guidelines and Good… Ultraschall in Med 2020; 41: 562–585 | © 2020. Thieme. All rights reserved. 575

the incidental FLL, as well as for the assessment of malignancy, re￾currence and treatment response in the pediatric population
[265].
Experience with the assessment of pediatric FLL has been
based on the extensive investigations of adult FLL, with initial ex￾perience using SonoVue in pediatric practice mainly centered
around the investigation of indeterminate FLLs seen on an US ex￾amination [265]. A single study applying adult criteria for the
CEUS diagnosis of FNH and HCA found good concordance with
MR and CT imaging [266]. More extensive experience has been
documented with blunt abdominal trauma of the liver, and in the
follow-up of focal areas of injury in the liver [267–269]. Experience
using CEUS in the assessment of the liver transplant recipients is
limited, with studies reporting success mainly with areas of infarc￾tion and abscess formation, with vascular “Doppler rescue” useful
[270–272]. For details we refer to the EFSUMB position paper
“Role of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in Paediatric Prac￾tice: An EFSUMB Position Statement” [19].
Safety and Dose
Most extensive assessment of safety in children has been with
SonoVue, with reports of severe anaphylaxis in 1/137 (0.6 %)
patients studied [273] and two minor delayed adverse reactions
in 2/305 (0.7 %) patients in a review of local clinical practice
[274]. Current evidence suggests that the safety profile of using
SonoVue in children is similar to that in adults.
The recommended dose from the FDA for Lumason in asses￾sing FLL is based on body weight, 0.03 mL per kg, not exceeding
2.4 mL per injection. On a more practical basis, other authors
have indicated a dose regime for the liver that is age based, with
adult doses for children over 12 years of age (SonoVue 2.4 mL),
half the adult dose between 6 and 12 years (1.2 mL), and one
quarter the adult dose under the age of six years (0.6 mL), well
within the safety margins of dose finding studies in adults [274].
These relatively small doses may continue to decrease as imaging
technology improves [19].
Indications for pediatric liver CEUS
▪ The child with any incidentally discovered FLLs on an US exam￾ination should also have the opportunity to be assessed with a
CEUS examination. The CEUS examination requires an intrave￾nous line, as would a CECT or CEMRI examination. Limited evi￾dence suggests the CEUS assessment of a FLL is as accurate in
the child as in the adult, without the morbidity of ionizing ra￾diation, iodinated contrast, gadolinium-based contrast or the
need for sedation or general anesthesia.
▪ Any indeterminate FLL in a child with underlying chronic liver
disease from any cause on a follow up program should have a
CEUS examination prior to any other imaging, with the possi￾bility of avoiding further imaging if the lesion is categorically
benign.
▪ The assessment of vascular complications following liver
transplantation benefits from the ‘Doppler rescue’ of a CEUS
examination before resorting to a CT examination.
▪ Initial investigation of blunt abdominal trauma in children
should involve a CT examination except for the most trivial
trauma. Follow-up of the identified areas of localized, low-en￾ergy liver trauma may be readily assessed with a CEUS exami￾nation, where a complicating traumatic pseudoaneurysm is
readily identified, and progressive healing of lacerations or
hematomas can be recorded on serial investigations.
RECOMMENDATION 32
CEUS assessment of FLLs in children is consistent with findings
in the adult patients and it should be used to characterize
these lesions (LoE 2b, strong recommendation) (Pro 25,
Abs 0, Against 0).
RECOMMENDATION 33
CEUS follow-up of traumatic liver injuries in children should be
utilized for the assessment of complications, reducing ioniz￾ing radiation exposure (LoE 2, strong recommendation)
(Pro 26, Abs 1, Against 0).
Documentation
All US examinations should principally be documented both by
wording and by image storage to ensure high-quality patient
care [275]. However, there exists little scientific evidence to sub￾stantiate how this should be done. This is a matter of expert opi￾nion and practice differs substantially worldwide. Each image
lesion should be described in terms of size, localization (liver seg￾ment), and contrast enhancement in all phases [276]. The opera￾tor should record the temporal behavior and degree of enhance￾ment relative to surrounding tissue (non-enhanced, hypo￾enhanced, iso-enhanced or hyper-enhanced), as well as the UCA
distribution (homogeneous or heterogeneous) [23].
The written report must include type and dose of UCA applied.
Furthermore, the enhancement pattern in all phases should be
described with a conclusion regarding diagnosis and follow-up. It
is important to report washout timing in actual seconds or min￾utes. Real-time video clips should be recorded, preferably digital￾ly, in a format which enables later retrieval and comparison [277].
The clips should ideally show the whole examination, but at least
the AP and other clinically relevant parts of the scan should be
recorded and stored. Cine loops can be supplied with still images
of relevant findings. Finally, the clips and images should be ar￾chived permanently.
RECOMMENDATION 34
The user of a CEUS examination should report the type and
dose(s) of contrast agent, the enhancement pattern and clini￾cally relevant findings in a written format (LoE 5, strong
recommendation) (Pro 27, Abs 1, Against 0).

Guidelines & Recommendations

RECOMMENDATION 35
During the CEUS examination representative images and cine
loops should be captured and stored according to the relevant
medical-legal framework (LoE 5, strong recommendation)
(Pro 26, Abs 0, Against 2).
Clinical training and education
Adequate knowledge and hands-on training are prerequisites for
building competence in the use of CEUS. Therefore, it is of great im￾portance to maintain high quality education and high professional
standards in the practice of CEUS. In 2006, three levels of training
requirements were defined by EFSUMB [261], with Appendix 14
specifically addressing the use of CEUS [262]. It is recommended
that CEUS should be performed by operators who have obtained
adequate expertise with both conventional US and CEUS. They
should be familiar with these techniques and the distribution of
pathologies within their local medical environment; they should
be recognized as competent by local standards and the relevant
medicolegal framework. Some federations offer dedicated CEUS
courses on a regular basis, often in collaboration with the UCA- or
US-equipment industry and it is beneficial for any user of CEUS to
attend such educational activities [278]. It is advised that investiga￾tors intending to start using CEUS attend relevant courses and
spend time under the supervision of an expert. Ideally, their own
department should have sufficient volume of examinations to
maintain adequate numbers of cases with various pathologies. Fur￾thermore, it is advised that the manufacturers are consulted to
maintain up-to-date CEUS scanner software. The practice of CEUS
also requires knowledge of UCA administration, of contra-indica￾tions and necessary skills to handle possible side effects within the
medico-legal framework of the country of practice.
RECOMMENDATION 36
Users must have adequate knowledge and training in CEUS,
UCA administration and contraindications, and perform the
examination within the relevant medico-legal framework
(LoE 5, strong recommendation) (Pro 27, Abs 1; Against 0).
Errors and artifacts in CEUS of the liver
Errors may occur in the CEUS of the liver due to the limitations of
CEUS and other factors, such as contrast dose, MI, image artifacts,
background noise, pseudoenhancement, unintended microbubble
destruction, attenuation, shadowing, prolonged heterogeneous liv￾er enhancement. These errors may result in lesion mischaracteriza￾tion. It is recommended that CEUS imaging interpretation should
be performed in conjunction with analysis of patient’s clinical his￾tory, symptoms and laboratory values. In select cases when CEUS
imaging results are discordant, correlation with other imaging
modalities or tissue sampling might be advised.
RECOMMENDATION 37
Appropriate dose of contrast agent based on lesion location,
patient factors and sensitivity of US scanner as well as imaging
with appropriate low mechanical index should be used to pro￾duce high quality CEUS images (LoE 5, strong recommenda￾tion) (Pro 26, Abs 2, Against 0).
Similar to every other imaging modality, image artifacts are often
encountered in liver CEUS [279–281]. They may be intrinsic to
contrast-mode imaging itself or relate to traditional B-mode arti￾facts. Some artifacts may affect image quality or simulate pathol￾ogy but rarely result in misdiagnosis [282]. Others may be useful,
leading to more confident diagnosis.
RECOMMENDATION 38
When using CEUS a knowledge of artifacts associated with
CEUS is recommended (LoE 5, strong recommendation)
(Pro 27, Abs 1, Ag 0).
