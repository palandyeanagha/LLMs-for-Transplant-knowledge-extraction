Abstract Background Accurate assessments of muscle mass in patients with cirrhosis are necessary in clinical 
practice. Computed tomography (CT) of the upper abdomen has been proposed as a useful method for 
quantifying muscle mass. Recently, Carey et al developed specific cutoffs for muscle wasting based on the 
skeletal muscle index at the L3 vertebra (L3-SMI) for cirrhotic patients. The aim of the present study was 
to assess the concurrent validity of the newly proposed cutoffs of Carey et al, along with others widely 
used in several clinical contexts, using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the reference method.
Methods Data were evaluated from 97 Caucasian patients (59.8% male, 59.1±11.6 years old, 
45.4% decompensated) with cirrhosis of various etiologies. Muscle mass was assessed using the 
appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) by DXA and the L3-SMI by CT. Low L3-SMI was defined 
in relation to 5 different cutoffs.
Results Low muscle mass prevalence was 13.4% according to ALMI and 26.8-45.4% according to the 
different cutoffs applied for L3-SMI. The Carey et al, Prado et al and Montano-Loza et al cutoffs showed 
similar sensitivity (all 69.2%) and specificity (79.8%, 76.2% and 75.0%, respectively) and high accuracy 
(78.4%, 75.3% and 74.2%). The Carey et al cutoffs showed the highest diagnostic validity against DXA: 
the multivariate odds ratio adjusted for age, sex, body mass index category, disease etiology and model 
for end-stage liver disease score (95% confidence interval) was 5.88 (1.36-25.4), P=0.018.
Conclusion Compared to DXA, the cutoffs for identifying muscle wasting proposed by Carey et al
were proven to be the most accurate.

Introduction
Muscle wasting is quite prevalent in cirrhosis, because of the 
metabolic changes that occur because of liver malfunction [1]. 
Lately, muscle mass quantification methods have attracted a lot 
of attention among the scientific community, mainly because 
of the significant negative impact of muscle wasting on the 
manifestation of disease complications and survival in patients 
with advanced liver disease [2]. Therefore, it has been suggested 
that muscle mass assessment should be performed routinely in 
this group of patients, using validated but also widely available 
techniques.
Radiological methods, i.e.,  dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) image 
analysis, have been proposed for muscle mass quantification 
in liver disease patients [3]. DXA, although costly and not 
widely available in clinical practice, is considered a highly 
accurate method, since it overcomes the possible accuracy

burden in cases of overhydration by estimating limb muscle 
mass [4,5]. Thus, it has been used as the reference method for 
the validation of other muscle mass quantification techniques, 
such as CT [6,7].
Muscle mass area by CT image analysis in the L3 vertebra 
has been positively correlated with whole body muscle mass in 
oncology patients [8] and negatively with survival specifically 
in patients with advanced liver disease [9]. Since this method 
was originally developed for muscle mass quantification in 
oncology patients, its application in cirrhotic patients has until 
recently been performed arbitrarily, using cutoffs developed 
for the oncological population [10,11]. During the past few 
years, specific cutoff points have been developed for liver 
disease patients [12,13]. The most recent ones, proposed 
by Carey et al [13], have been supported by the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) for muscle 
mass assessment of cirrhotic patients, though with a note that 
additional validation studies are needed [5]. Similarly, Carey 
et al [13] urged for validation of their proposed cutoff values 
in other groups of patients. Therefore, the aim of the present 
study was to assess the concurrent validity of the newly 
proposed cutoffs of Carey et al, as well as other cutoff points 
widely used in several clinical conditions, against DXA as the 
reference method.
Patients and methods
Study sample
Ninety-seven Caucasian adult (>18 years old) cirrhotic 
patients (58 male; mean age 59.1±11.6 years) from the 
KIRRHOS study (study for the evaluation of dietary intake, 
body composition and performance status in cirrhotic patients) 
for whom CT scans were available participated in this analysis. 
Patients’ enrollment was performed in 2 outpatient liver clinics 
(Academic Department of Gastroenterology, Laiko General 
Hospital of Athens, and 2nd Academic Department of Internal 
Medicine, Hippokratio General Hospital of Athens) from June 
2015 to July 2018. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on liver 
biopsy or a combination of clinical, laboratory and imaging data 
(Fibroscan values >14 kPa or clinical picture of decompensated 
cirrhosis, i.e.,  manifestation of ascites, edema, esophageal or 
gastric varices and/or encephalopathy). Exclusion criteria 
included pregnancy or lactation, presence of hepatocellular 
or other forms of cancer, hepatic coma, diagnosed acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome, renal or pancreatic insufficiency 
and active enteral feeding. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis 
were included in the study only if alcohol intake had already 
ceased for at least one month before enrollment in the study. A 
consent form was signed by all participants, after they had been 
fully informed about the aims of the study. The protocol was 
approved by the Bioethics Committee of Harokopio University 
and the Scientific Committees of all participating Hospitals 
and it has been registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov system (ID 
NCT03242798).
Medical assessment
Medical assessment was implemented by the study physician. 
Disease etiology and any clinical manifestations related to 
cirrhosis, such as ascites, edema, esophageal or gastric varices 
and encephalopathy, as well as their severity, were recorded. 
Patients were classified as compensated or decompensated, 
based on the absence or presence of the abovementioned clinical 
complications, respectively. Recent measurements (within a 
month prior to baseline evaluation) of total bilirubin, serum 
creatinine and prothrombin time were also collected from 
the medical records. Based on the biochemical data collected, 
the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score [14] was 
calculated for the estimation of disease severity.
Anthropometry and body composition
Body weight (BW) was measured using an analog scale 
and height using a stadiometer (Seca 711). Dry weight was 
calculated by subtracting 5% of the measured BW for mild 
ascites, 10% for moderate ascites and 15% for tense ascites, 
with an additional 5% subtracted if bilateral pedal edema was 
present, as suggested by EASL [5]. Dry body mass index (BMI) 
was also calculated [15].
Body composition analysis was performed using the DXA 
method and the appendicular lean mass index (ALMI, kg/m2
) 
was calculated. Low ALMI was defined using the cutoffs of 
<7.59 kg/m2 for men ≤65 years old and <7.64 for men >65 
years old, and <5.47 kg/m2
 for women ≤65 years old and 
<5.78 for women >65 years old, derived from a Mediterranean 
population [16]. Muscle mass estimation was also performed 
by computing the muscle mass area at the level of the L3 
vertebra (L3-SM), using appropriate software (SliceOmatic 
V4.3 software, Tomovision, Montreal, PQ). More specifically, 
an individual section of the CT scan at the L3 vertebra level was 
isolated and the areas of the psoas, paraspinal and abdominal 
wall (including rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and 
internal and external oblique) muscles were outlined. Using 
the Hounsfield unit (HU) range for which muscle mass 
absorbs X-rays (-29, +150), the cross-sectional area of the 
above mentioned muscles was semi-automatically quantified, 
leading to an estimation of the total cross-sectional area of the 
abdominal skeletal muscles at the L3 level (L3-SM in cm2
). The 
estimated muscle mass area was then normalized to height to 
calculate skeletal muscle index: L3-SMI (cm2
/m2
) = L3-SM in 
cm2
/height2 in m2
. Five different cutoff values were applied in 
the present study, most of which had been previously applied 
in cirrhotic patients:

Statistical analysis
We calculated that a total of 94 patients would be required 
to evaluate 2-sided differences at a 5% significance level 
(i.e., 95% confidence interval [95%CI]), based on the following 
assumptions: i) the prevalence of low muscle mass in a sample 
of chronic liver disease patients of various disease stages and 
etiologies is around 13% [21]; and ii) the annual population size 
of cirrhotic patients who visit the outpatient clinics participating 
in the study and are eligible for recruitment is 200. The achieved 
statistical power (i.e., 1 minus Type-II error) was 95%.
Categorical variables were represented as absolute numbers 
and relative frequencies. The normality of the continuous variables 
was examined using the Shapiro-Wilk test and graphically 
through Q-Q plots. Normally distributed continuous variables 
were expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) and 
non-normally distributed as median and 1st-3rd quartiles. The 
χ2
 test was used for comparisons between categorical variables 
and the agreement between them was examined using Cohen’s 
kappa coefficient (kappa). The independent samples t-test 
was used for comparison of normally distributed continuous 
variables between patients with low and adequate muscle mass 
according to DXA, while the Mann-Whitney test was used for 
non-normally distributed variables.
The correlation between the quantification of muscle mass 
as estimated by ALMI, by DXA and L3-SMI by CT analysis 
was assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). Study 
participants’ z-scores for muscle mass estimated by ALMI and 
L3-SMI were calculated according to sex, based on the mean 
of the ALMI and L3-SMI and the corresponding standard 
deviations from the study sample. Bland-Altman plots [22] 
were used to evaluate the relative validity of L3-SMI against 
ALMI, according to sex. The plots showed the difference 
between each individual’s z-scores derived from ALMI and 
L3-SMI against their means [22]. The bias (mean difference 
between ALMI z-scores and L3-SMI z-scores in our study 
sample) and the corresponding limits of agreement (±2 SD) of 
the mean difference were calculated.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values 
(PPV and NPV), positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR 
and NLR) and accuracy were calculated for the various cutoffs 
against the reference DXA method. Logistic regression analysis 
was applied to assess the relationship between muscle wasting 
identification based on DXA and muscle wasting as identified 
using 5 different cutoffs based on CT analysis, after adjusting 
for the following confounders: age (years), sex (male/female), 
disease etiology (viral/alcoholic/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis/
primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]-autoimmune/unknown), 
BMI category (underweight/normal weight/overweight/
obese), MELD score, and presence of ascites (yes/no).
Results
Participants’ descriptive characteristics in relation to muscle 
mass category according to ALMI are presented in Table 1. 
Among the study participants, 74.3% had high BW. Chronic 
viral infection (by hepatitis B or C virus) was the leading cause 
of cirrhosis among study participants, accounting for the 53.6% 
of disease etiology. Almost half of the study participants had 
decompensated cirrhosis (45.4%). Low muscle mass prevalence 
according to ALMI was estimated at 13.4% in the total study 
sample. Moreover, patients with high BW (overweight and 
obese altogether) were more likely to have adequate muscle 
mass compared with normal and underweight patients 
(P=0.041). It should also be noted that a higher percentage of 
patients with alcoholic etiology was found in the low muscle 
mass subgroup compared with the normal muscle mass group 
(46.2% vs. 20.2%, P=0.041), while the relevant difference 
observed for patients with PBC/autoimmune etiology did not 
appear to be statistically significant (0.0% vs. 16.7%, P=0.112). 
Overall, there were 5 patients with PBC etiology among the 
study participants, most of them with compensated cirrhosis 
(80%) and with increased BW (80%), but none with low ALMI 
(0%).
Correlation of muscle mass estimation between ALMI and 
L3-SMI by CT
Quantification of muscle mass by estimation of ALMI by 
DXA and L3-SMI by CT were highly correlated in the total 
sample (r=0.613, P<0.001) and in both sexes (r=0.392, P=0.002 
for men and r=0.641, P<0.001 in women). When the z-scores 
for each patient were calculated based on the mean of the ALMI 
and the L3-SMI according to sex (ALMI mean ± SD for men: 
8.17±1.0 and for women: 6.99±0.92, and L3-SMI mean ± SD 
for men: 53.1±6.6 and for women: 45.2±9.1), 2 Bland-Altman 
plots were constructed to compare the 2 methods of muscle 
mass quantification based on the relative z-scores according to 
sex (Fig. 1). The bias and the corresponding limits of agreement 
(±SD) of the mean difference were 0.00 (±1.10) for men (Fig. 
1A) and 0.07 (±0.73) for women (Fig. 1B). Based on the plots 
depicted in Fig. 1 A,B, no statistically significant correlations 
between average and difference were detected in either sex 
(P=0.996 for men and P=0.269 in women in the regression 
analyses between the average and the difference of the z-scores 
between methods in each sex). Consequently, L3-SMI showed 
acceptable agreement with the reference method of ALMI in 
both sexes.
Concurrent validity of 5 cutoffs for muscle mass assessment 
based on CT analysis against ALMI by DXA
Compared to ALMI categorization (low vs. adequate) of 
muscle mass, considered the reference for muscle wasting 
diagnosis, the Carey et al cutoffs, followed by the Prado et al
and the Montano-Loza et al cutoffs, were the most accurate 

4 A. Georgiou et al
Annals of Gastroenterology 33
(accuracy: 78.4%, 75.3% and 74.2%, respectively) (Table 2), 
estimating muscle wasting prevalence at 26.8%, 29.9% and 
30.9%, accordingly. The cutoffs by Mourtzakis et al showed the 
highest sensitivity (84.6%), but low specificity (60.7%), leading 
to less accurate results.
To support the findings mentioned above, logistic 
regressions were performed to examine the probability of a 
patient having low muscle mass according to the reference 
method of ALMI when categorized as having low muscle 
mass based on CT analysis using the 5 different cutoffs. 
After adjustment for age, sex, BMI category, disease etiology, 
presence of ascites and MELD score, patients found to 
have low muscle mass according to Carey et al cutoffs, 
had a 5.88 times higher probability of having low muscle 
mass according to ALMI (95%CI 1.36-25.4, P=0.018). 
Assessment of low muscle mass with either the Prado et al
or the Montano-Loza et al cutoffs was also correlated with 
low muscle mass according to ALMI (odds ratio [OR] 4.24, 
95%CI 1.01-17.8, P=0.049; and OR 5.27, 95%CI 1.22-22.8, 
P=0.026, respectively).

Discussion
The present study aimed to estimate the validity of the 
cutoffs newly proposed by Carey et al for L3-SMI assessment 
by CT in cirrhotic patients, as well as other prominent cutoffs, 
against the reference method of ALMI. According to our 
results, the prevalence of low muscle mass in our population 
sample was estimated to be 11.3% according to ALMI. When 
assessed against ALMI, the Carey et al cutoffs showed the 
best accuracy and agreement compared to the other cutoffs 
examined, followed by the cutoffs proposed by Prado et al and 
Montano-Loza et al.
Low muscle mass has a significant prognostic value in 
liver disease [23]; thus, quantification and assessment of 
muscle mass in cirrhotic patients can be considered a crucial 
step in the nutritional assessment and management of these 
patients, especially in the light of emerging data suggesting 
possible therapeutic approaches [24]. There are many available 
methods for the assessment of muscle mass, all showing both 
strengths and limitations. Anthropometry, such as skinfold 
thickness measurement, is an easily applicable, rapid and low￾cost method; however, it seems to lack accuracy in cirrhotic 
patients [25]. Bioelectrical impedance has also been applied in 
patients with advanced liver disease, offering the advantages of 
a low cost and portable equipment. However, the accuracy of 
this method is highly affected by the hydration status, unstable
in cirrhotic patients [26]. The application of DXA in cirrhotic 
patients is highly supported [3,5], since the estimation of 
ALMI, by excluding the muscle mass assessed in the trunk 
area, overcomes the possible error due to ascites. However, the 
equipment is quite costly, thus limiting its application to the 
research area rather than clinical practice [5]. Cross-sectional 
imaging at the L3 vertebra by CT is widely accepted as a reliable 
method for direct muscle mass quantification [24], and low 
muscle mass estimation according to this method has been 
associated with an increased risk for mortality in cirrhotic 
patients [23]. The application of CT analysis in cirrhotic patients 
could be widely supported, as cirrhotic patients frequently 
undergo CT scanning as part of their medical follow up [5]. 
The only drawback so far has been the lack of widely accepted 
and validated cutoffs for this method in patients with advanced 
liver disease [27]. Thus, muscle mass quantification through CT 
cross-sectional imaging analysis is emerging as a useful tool in 
the nutritional assessment of cirrhotic patients, but will find 
wide acceptance only if specific cutoffs can be established.
In our study, muscle mass quantification by DXA was largely 
correlated with that by CT analysis. Similar findings were 
reported by Lindqvist et al in patients with chronic liver disease 
during the pre-transplant period [28] and by Ishakawa et al in 
a sample of cirrhotic patients with and without hepatocellular 
carcinoma [29]. Notably, the prevalence of low muscle mass in 
our study did not reveal any statistically significant difference 
in relation to disease etiology in general; however, it should be 
noted that a significantly higher percentage of patients with an 
alcoholic etiology was found in the low muscle mass subgroup 
compared with the normal muscle mass group. This is finding 
is to be expected considering the detrimental effect of chronic 
alcohol abuse on muscle mass and protein balance in general [30].
Considering the strong association of the L3-SMI technique 
with the reference method of ALMI in our study, we sought to 
examine the validity of the newly proposed cutoffs by Carey 
et al [13] in comparison with another 4 widely applied cutoffs 
for L3-SMI assessment. According to our results, the cutoffs 
by Carey et al, specifically developed for cirrhotic patients, 
showed the best accuracy, agreement and correlation with 
the reference method, followed by the cutoffs proposed by 
Prado et al and Montano-Loza et al, which showed slightly 
inferior performance. The Carey et al cutoffs, derived from 
a large multicenter study and endorsed by EASL [5], as well 
as the Montano-Loza et al cutoffs, have been developed 
especially for cirrhotic patients; however, they have not yet 
been widely applied, and only the Carey et al cutoffs have 
been validated against survival in one study so far [31]. The 
cutoffs by Prado et al, although non-disease specific, have been 
previously applied in studies with cirrhotic patients [10,32], 
but their validity in this group of patients has never been 
examined before. In our study, the 3 abovementioned cutoffs 
showed similarly fair agreement, good accuracy and adequate 
sensitivity and specificity. The NPVs of the cutoffs were high, 
in contrast to the PPVs, which were quite low (all <35%), 
indicating that 2/3 of the patients categorized with low muscle 
mass according to the CT analysis would not be categorized as 
such by the reference method.

The present study has both strengths and limitations. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study ever to comparatively assess 
the concurrent validity of 5 different cutoffs for muscle mass 
assessment based on CT analysis in cirrhotic patients. Moreover, 
the study sample consisted of patients with cirrhosis from 
various causes, evenly distributed among sex and disease stage, 
allowing the results to be extrapolated to the whole range of the 
disease. Regarding limitations, the absence of a gold standard 
method for muscle mass assessment is a barrier in every study on 
this topic, creating a risk of bias. Although DXA, applied in the 
present study, exhibits some drawbacks, such as its high cost and 
the expertise needed by the operator, it has been suggested by 
both EASL and ESPEN as a method of muscle mass assessment 
in liver disease [3,5] and is generally considered a standardized, 
widely known and valid reference method, since the ALMI value 
does not appear to be affected by fluid accumulation in cirrhotic 
patients [4]. Thus, it was chosen in the present study as the 
reference method for muscle mass assessment.
In conclusion, muscle mass quantification by the reference 
method DXA showed a large correlation with CT cross￾sectional imaging analysis. Regarding muscle mass assessment 
according to L3-SMI, of the 5 different cutoffs implemented in 
the present study, the Carey et al cutoffs [13] are confirmed to 
be the most accurate in detecting low muscle mass in cirrhotic 
patients, closely followed by the ones proposed by Prado et al
and Montano-Loza et al. The present study is an additional 
validation of the diagnostic value of the Carey et al cutoffs and a 
step towards standardization of these cutoffs as the benchmark 
for muscle mass assessment in cirrhosis based on CT analysis.

Summary Box
What is already known:
•	 Muscle wasting has a significant negative impact
on disease complications and survival in patients 
with advanced liver disease
•	 Radiological methods have been proposed for
muscle mass quantification in liver disease patients
•	 Muscle mass area estimation by computed
tomography (CT) image analysis has been 
recognized as a main method for muscle mass 
quantification globally, but no standard cutoffs 
have been established
•	 Recently, Carey et al proposed new cutoffs, which 
have been endorsed by the European Association for 
the Study of the Liver but have not yet been validated
What the new findings are:
•	 Muscle mass quantification by dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) is strongly correlated with 
the results from CT image analysis
•	 The cutoffs proposed by Carey et al proved to be 
the most accurate in identifying low muscle mass 
as assessed by the reference method (i.e., DXA)
