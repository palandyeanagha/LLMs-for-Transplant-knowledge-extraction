In the inflamed cornea, there is a parallel outgrowth of blood and lymphatic vessels into the normally avas￾cular cornea. We tested whether adaptive and/or innate immune cells were actively involved in the genesis of
new lymphatic vessels. Our results indicate that innate immune cells (CD11b+ macrophages, but not CD11c+
dendritic cells) physically contributed to lymphangiogenesis under pathological conditions and that bone
marrow–derived CD11b+ macrophages expressed lymphatic endothelial markers such as LYVE-1 and Prox-1
under inflamed conditions in the corneal stromata of mice. Furthermore, blood vascular endothelial cells that
expressed the Tie2 promoter did not contribute to newly formed lymphatic vessels under inflamed conditions.
Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that CD11b+ macrophages alone were capable of forming tube-like
structures that expressed markers oflymphatic endothelium such as LYVE-1 and podoplanin. The novelfind￾ing thatCD11b+ macrophages are criticalfor the development ofinflammation-dependentlymphangiogenesis
in the eye suggests a new mechanism of lymphangiogenesis.
Introduction
Lymphangiogenesis is an important milestone in tumor progres￾sion, and the extravasation of tumor cells via lymphatic vessels is
thought to play a role in tumor dissemination. The lymphatic sys￾tem also plays an essential role in the immune response to infec￾tious agents. Afferent lymphatic vessels are the route by which
APCs migrate to the regional lymph nodes and lymphoid organs.
The cornea is normally devoid of blood vessels and lymphatics;
however, during inflammatory conditionssuch as penetrating ker￾atoplasty (PKP), lymphatic vessels appear in the corneal stroma.
We have previously suggested that lymphangiogenesis correlates
with the corneal rejection reaction that occurs after PKP (1–3).
Although the mechanismsthat induce hemangiogenesis and lym￾phangiogenesis in the cornea after inflammation are not yet com￾pletely understood, newly recruited bone marrow–derived cells,
such as macrophages, are known to produce angiogenic factors
and therefore may play an important role (4).
Lymphatic vessels are often identified by electron microscopy.
Ultrastructure characteristics of lymphatic vessels include the
absence of luminal erythrocytes and a lack of abluminal peri￾cytes. The lumens of lymphatic vessels appear collapsed and
therefore are wide and thin and partly overlap the endothelial
lining (5–7). While these features distinguish the structure of
lymphatic vessels from blood vessels, a definitive method by
which to identify lymphatic vessels based on their ultrastruc￾ture has yet to be developed (8). The lack of markers specific
for the lymphatic endothelium has hampered the study of lym￾phangiogenesis. Recently, lymphatic markers such as VEGFR-3,
podoplanin, prospero-related homeobox 1 (Prox-1), and lymphatic
endothelium–specific hyaluronic acid receptor 1 (LYVE-1) were
identified. Although VEGFR-3 is expressed by immature blood
vessels and not by mature ones, it is constitutively expressed
by the lymphatic endothelium (9–17). Bone marrow–derived
CD11b+ macrophages and APCs such as CD11c+ dendritic cells
have been documented to be present in the corneal stroma
(18). It is known that CD11b+ macrophages produce VEGF-C
and -D (4) and that the action of these cytokines on conjunc￾tival lymphatic vessels via VEGFR-3 leads to the induction of
lymphangiogenesis in the injured cornea (19). Moreover, some
CD11b+ macrophages express LYVE-1 in the conjunctiva (20).
Both VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR-3 have been reported to
be produced and expressed by activated macrophages (21, 22).
Ligation of VEGFR-3 monocytes results in an immediate release
of chemokines, an increase in the number of macrophages, and
induction of hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Based on
these previous results, we postulated that activated macrophages
have a critical role in the inflammation and pathogenesis that
occurs after corneal transplantation.
We therefore examined the relationship between inflamma￾tion-induced pathological lymphangiogenesis and the immune
cells’ response in mice subjected to corneal transplantation or
suturing. Since the healthy cornea is normally avascular but
allows the growth of blood and lymphatic vessels during inflam￾Nonstandard abbreviations used: BVEPC, blood vascular endothelial progenitor

mation (23, 24), it is wellsuited for the study of hemangiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis. Lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogen￾esis have a critical role for antigen presentation and recruitment
of the activated T cell to the site of attaching alloantigen. We
found that inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis sprouted
from clusters of CD11b+ cells in the center of the cornea rather
than from the vessels in the limbus (periphery). These findings
may be useful not only for studying rejection reactions after
organ transplantation, but may also lead to a better understand￾ing of tumor dissemination.
Results
Initial and late phases of lymphatic vessels in the corneal stroma. On day 3
afterinflammationwasinduced in the cornea by PKP,we observed
lymphatic vessels arising from the limbal area (Figure 1A).
Unlike hemangiogenesis, in which lymphatic vessels can sprout
from limbal vessels, the new lymphatic vessels appeared de novo
to form from cell aggregates (Figure 1, A–C). LYVE-1+ cells in the
vicinity of lymphatic vessels(Figure 1C) appeared to coalesce with
lymphatic vessels, raising the question as to how the lymphatic
vessels are formed. Some of the lymphatic vessels did not have
connections with limbal lymphatic vessels (Figure 1, D and E).
Seven days after corneal transplantation, we observed these
lymphatic vessels in the central area of the cornea (Figure 1F).
Figure 1G illustrates the increased corneal hemangiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis observed after corneal transplanta￾tion. We determined that the lymphatic vessels that formed in
corneal explant cultures after inflammatory stimulation were
formed by endogenous corneal and/or recruited cells. A corneal
explant that consisted of the central 2-mm portion of cornea
(not including the limbal area) was stimulated with IL-1β. Small
structures (resembling lymphatic vessels) positive for CD31 and
LYVE-1 were detected in central corneal explants cultured for 2–3
days. The development of these lymphatic-like structures was
not continuous with that of limbal lymphatic vessels; rather, the
new structures appeared to form de novo in the corneal tissue
with limbal lymphatic vessels but appeared to form de novo in
the corneal tissue (Figure 1H).
During the late phase of inflammation (approximately 56
days after PKP in syngeneic transplantation), lymphangiogen￾esis appeared to cease, and the lymphatic vessels disassembled.
The remaining LYVE-1+ cells (Figure 1I) appeared dendritic in
nature (Figure 1, J and K). In contrast to lymphatic vessels, some
of the blood vessels induced under inflamed conditions were
covered by dencytes and matured after the inflammation subsid￾ed (data not shown). We therefore determined that the inflam￾mation-induced lymphangiogenesis process (subsided) differs
from inflammation-induced hemangiogenesis (matured). At
this point in the study, there was no evidence of post-transplant
inflammation. These observations suggest that the mechanisms
underlying the formation of lymphatic vessels are very different
from those involved in hemangiogenesis during corneal inflam￾mation, wherein the new blood vessels originate from the limbal
circulation, and that the noninflamed cornea contains cells that
are capable of participating in the formation of lymphatic ves￾sels during inflammation.
Contribution of adaptive immune cells to hemangiogenesis and lymphan￾giogenesis after PKP. The rejection reaction after PKP is associated
with an antigen-specific, delayed-type hypersensitivity response.
Therefore, we examined whether adaptive immune cells(i.e., T and
B lymphocytes) play a role in hemangiogenesis and/or lymphan￾giogenesis after PKP (Figure 2, A–E). We sensitized BALB/c mice
to C57BL/6 alloantigens and compared the corneal graft–induced
lymphangiogenesis in immunized versus immunoincompetent
(SCID) mice. The levels of hemangiogenesis and lymphangio￾Figure 1

genesis did not differ significantly between sensitized and SCID
mice on day 3 (data notshown) or even day 7 aftertransplantation
(Figure 2, F–H). These findings indicate that after PKP, heman￾giogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are not mediated by an adap￾tive immune response involving T or B lymphocytes. Thus, we
concluded that hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were
induced by innate immune cells during acute inflammation, as is
seen following corneal grafting.
Corneal lymphatic endothelium express CD11b but not CD11c. After
ruling out a role for antigen-specific lymphocytes, we examined
the ability of innate immune cells to establish lymphatic vessels.
Both lymphatic endothelial cells and some of the cells within
and around lymphatic vessels expressed LYVE-1. Morphological￾ly, these cells resembled dendritic cells. Immunostaining for the
presence of CD11b, CD11c, and LYVE-1 revealed that CD11b+
and LYVE-1+ cells, but not CD11c+ cells, contributed to the for￾mation of the lymphatic vessels (Figure 3, A–F). Moreover, 3 days
after suture placement, cells positive for both CD11b and Prox-1
were observed in the corneal stroma (Figure 3, G–I). As observed
in the central cornea, the presence of CD11b+ cellsin the new ves￾sel structures was not continuous with those lymphatic vessels
originating from the limbal area (Figure 3, J–M). These obser￾vations support the notion that CD11b+ cells, but not CD11c+
cells, are involved in the formation of the pathologic lymphatic
vessels and are consistent with the macrophagic origin of these
lymphatic endothelial cells.
Presence of bone marrow–derived cells in the walls of lymphatic ves￾sels. Since it has been reported that CD11b+ cells in the cornea
are derived from the bone marrow (25), we postulated that bone
marrow–derived cells were involved in the assembly of the lym￾phatic vessels. To assess the role of bone marrow–derived cells in
lymphangiogenesis, we adoptively transferred enhanced green
fluorescent protein–positive (EGFP+) bone marrow–derived cells
to lethally irradiated mice and determined whether the tran￾scribed cells integrated into newly formed inflammation-induced
lymphatic vessels. Three sutures were placed on the cornea of
EGFP+ chimera mice that had received EGFP+ bone marrow cells 2
months earlier. Seven days aftersuturing, the cornea wasremoved
and stained for LYVE-1. Cell aggregates containing LYVE-1 and
EGFP double-positive cells were identified in the cornea (Figure 3,
N–T). Though the transplanted EGFP+ cells seemed to be inti￾mately involved with the lymphatic vessel wall, we cannot rule out
a role for the resident macrophagessince it is possible that cellsin
tissues may survive after irradiation (26).
Effect of macrophage depletion on lymphangiogenesis. It has been pre￾viously shown that local depletion of macrophages by administra￾tion of clodronate liposomes suppresses corneal lymphangiogen￾esis induced by suture placement (4). Similarly, we observed that
systemic elimination of macrophages using clodronate liposomes
was also effective in suppressing both corneal lymphangiogenesis
and CD11b+ macrophage infiltration in this model (Figure 4).
From these results, we concluded that macrophages have an
important role in the induction of lymphangiogenesis.
Contribution of blood vascular endothelial progenitor cells to lymphan￾giogenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the circulat￾ing blood vascular endothelial progenitor cells (BVEPCs) con￾tribute to corneal hemangiogenesis (27). During the induction
of corneal inflammation, BVEPCs are found in the new blood

vessels that arise from the limbus area (27). Endothelial progeni￾tor cells (EPCs) often appear under hypoxic or inflammatory
conditions and may share a precursor cell with APCs since they
express both CD11b and CD11c (28). We examined whether the
lymphatic EPC we observed in our model was a CD11b+ mac￾rophage. For these studies we used C57BL/6 Tie2-LacZ mice
in which the LacZ reporter gene is regulated by the endothe￾lium-specific Tie2 promoter. Inflammation was induced in the
corneas of Tie2-LacZ mice and bone marrow chimera mice with
3 corneal sutures. Seven days later, the corneas were removed,
stained for β-gal and LYVE-1, and examined by confocal micros￾copy. No β-gal and LYVE-1 double-positive cells were detected
in the lymphatic vessel walls of Tie2-LacZ mice (Figure 5, A–F).
Even in the chimeric mice, β-gal and LYVE-1 double-positive
cells were not detected in the newly formed lymphatic vessel
at the same corneal layer (Figure 5, G–L). Similar results were
obtained using a Tie2-GFP mouse (data not shown). Thus, we
conclude that BVEPCs do not play a role in the formation of the
lymphatic vessel wall in the cornea.
Ability of CD11b+ macrophages to form lymphatic-like tubes. Ourin vivo
experiments indicated that both bone marrow–derived cells and
CD11b+ macrophages play a role in the formation of pathologi￾cal lymphatic vessels. Therefore, we performed in vitro studies to
investigate whether CD11b+ macrophages were able to form lym￾phatic vessel–like structures. CD11b+ macrophages were collected
from the peritoneal cavity of mice using thioglycollate and cultured
in RPMI-1640. After 24 hours, the adherent cells were harvested
and characterized by flow cytometry. Results revealed that more
than 99.67% of peritoneal exudates cells (PECs) were positive for
CD11b (Figure 6A). By RT-PCR, we observed that thioglycollate￾stimulatedCD11b+ macrophages expressed VEGFR-3 and VEGF-C,
but not VEGFR-2 (Figure 6B). Of the CD11b+ cells, 30–50% were
also positive for LYVE-1, podoplanin, or Prox-1 (Figure 6C).
Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the PECs (cultured
for 24 hours) expressed CD11b and Prox-1 (Figure 6, D–F) as well
as podoplanin (Figure 6, G–I) and LYVE-1 protein (Figure 6, J–L).
Resting macrophages collected without thioglycollate stimulation
showedweak staining forlymphatic endothelial markers compared
to thioglycollate-stimulated cells (data not shown). From these
results, we concluded that activated, but not resting, CD11b+ mac￾rophages display markers of lymphatic vessels.
In vitro expression of lymphatic endothelial markers by CD11b+ mac￾rophages. We next investigated whether thioglycollate-stimulat￾ed CD11b+ macrophages could form tube-like structures and
express lymphatic endothelial markers. CD11b+ cells assembled
into vessel-like structures, and the ability of the cells to form ves￾sel-like structures varied with cell density. At 105 cells/ml, CD11b+
macrophages appeared to become aligned with one another and

formed a vascular-like network at around day 1 (Figure 7A). At
106 cells/ml, CD11b+ macrophages associated in clumps between
days 1 and 2 and then formed tube-like structures (Figure 7B).
Some clumps formed into tube-like structures earlier. We count￾ed both clumps (containing a minimum of 100 cells) and tube￾like structures (Figure 7C). At 2 × 106 cells/ml, the CD11b+ mac￾rophages survived for at least 31 days, and nearly all the cells
were associated with vessel-like structures (Figure 7, D and E).
Some of the cells assembled into a structure reminiscent of an
oil drum (Figure 7, F–J). The tube-like structures (Figure 7, K,
M, and O) stained positively for lymphatic endothelial markers
podoplanin (Figure 7, L and N) and LYVE-1 (Figure 7, P and R).
These observations suggest that CD11b+ macrophages have the
ability to assemble into tube-like structures in vitro.
Transmission electron microscope analysis for the tube-like structure 
in the Matrigel assay. To evaluate the ultrastructure of the tubes
formed by CD11b+ macrophages, the tube-like structures were
investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Seven-day
Matrigel cultures were prepared as described in Methods and
examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM; Figure 8,
A and B). The tube-like structures had lumens (Figure 8C), and
their walls were composed of loosely associated macrophages
lacking continuous basal lamina. The margins of the endothelial
cells appeared to be joined to adjacent cells (Figure 8, D and E) by
interdigitating or overlapping contacts (Figure 8, F and G) and
resembled filament-like tentacles.
Discussion
We show here that monocytic cells — especially CD11b+ CD11c–
macrophages, but not CD11b– CD11c+ dendritic cells or BVEPCs
— contributed to the formation of new lymphatic vessels in the
inflamed cornea and had the ability to form lymphatic vessel–like
structures in vitro. The lymphatic nature of the cells was demon￾strated by their expression of not only LYVE-1 but also Prox-1 and
podoplanin. Prox-1 is a key regulator in the molecular pathway
that forms the lymphatic vasculature and has been identified as a
master switch in the mechanism specifying lymphatic endothelial
cell fate (29). Moreover, systematic elimination of macrophages
using clodronate liposomes led to a near-complete inhibition of
lymphatic vessel formation in the inflamed cornea.
We were therefore interested in determining whether the lym￾phatic vessels in the inflamed cornea in vivo were formed from
indigenous or recruited cells. We used EGFP chimeric mice to
test the possibility that bone marrow–derived cells were respon￾sible for the generation of new lymphatic vessels. Our results
demonstrated the presence of EGFP-labeled cells in discrete
patches in the newly formed corneal lymphatic vessel wall,
indicating that bone marrow–derived cells were involved in the
establishment of the lymphatic vasculature following suture￾induced inflammation. Another possible explanation was that
bone marrow–derived BVEPCs were contributing to the forma￾tion of lymphatic vessels. However, we did not detect any Tie2-
positive cells in the nascent lymphatic vessels following trans￾plantation of bone marrow cells from Tie2-LacZ (or Tie2-GFP)
mice. Therefore BVEPCs, which are well documented for their
role in angiogenesis, do not appear to have a role in the devel￾opment of lymphatic vasculature in the inflamed cornea. The
observation that BVEPCs did not contribute to the formation of
corneal lymphatics is consistent with previous reports demon￾strating that endothelial cells sprouting from new blood vessels
do not undergo lymphatic differentiation (16).
Since we had ruled out a role for adaptive immunity in the
development of inflammation-mediated lymphangiogenesis, we
postulated that innate immune cells and their responsestriggered
corneal hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis immediately
following PKP. LYVE-1+ cells clearly exhibited a macrophage/den￾dritic cell morphology. This conclusion was supported by a previ￾ous report showing that lymphangiogenesis is eliminated in vivo
by local treatment with clodronate liposomes (4) and our present
observation that when systemic administration of clodronate lipo￾somes depleted CD11b+ macrophages, infiltration and formation
of lymphatic vessels were suppressed. It is known that the clodro￾nate liposomes are taken up selectively by phagocytic cells, which
indicates that dendritic cells do not contribute to the lymphatic
endothelium (30–32). Thus, we concluded that CD11b+ macro￾phages have an important role in the induction of lymphangio￾genesis in the inflamed cornea.
Our studies also revealed a mechanism for the development
of corneal lymphatic vessels that differs from previously known
mechanisms of corneal hemangiogenesis or postnatal lymphan￾giogenesis in any tissue to our knowledge. It is known that dur￾ing hemangiogenesis, the vessels sprout from preexisting limbal

vessels (4). Here we observed that during corneal inflamma￾tion, some of the lymphatic vessels appeared to arise de novo
within the corneal stroma at a distance from the limbus, with
no apparent connection to the limbal lymphatic structures.
These nascent lymphatic structures then connected to the lim￾bal lymphatic vessels. Interestingly, this phenomenon appeared
to be recapitulated in an in vitro tube-formation assay wherein
highly enriched thioglycollate-activated CD11b+ macrophages
cultured in Matrigel initially formed aggregates before form￾ing tube-like structures. These vessel-like structures expressed
lymphatic endothelial markers, including LYVE-1, Prox-1, and
podoplanin. Additionally, results of ultrastructural analysis of
tubes formed in vitro reveal that, like our lymphatic vessels in
vivo, the structures lack a continuous basal lamina (33). Thus,
CD11b+ macrophages form tube-like structures, which express
both the lymphatic endothelial markers and architecture of lym￾phatic vessels in situ.
It has been shown that VEGF-C participatesin the development
of the lymphatic vasculature through activation of VEGFR-3.
VEGF-C also plays a role in lymphangiogenesisin tumor develop￾ment and inflammatory conditions (34). Consistent with these
data, we previously observed that CD11b+ macrophages within
the inflamed cornealstroma express VEGF-C, and that bone mar￾row–derived macrophages express both Vegfc and Vegfd mRNA (4).
However, lymphangiogenesis may be induced under pathological
conditions by not only VEGF-C stimulation, but by other inflam￾matory mediators such as IL-1β, LPS, and PDGF-BB as well (35).
Our present in vitro data showed that exogenous VEGF-C stimu￾lation did not accelerate the formation of clusters and tube-like
structures, nor did it affect LYVE-1 expression (as measured by
flow cytometric analysis; data not shown). We suspect that the
exogenous addition of VEGF-C had no effect because the acti￾vated macrophages already secrete sufficient VEGF-C to induce
maximal phenotypic effect. In addition, we speculate that tube
formation in the Matrigel assay was density dependent simply
because a threshold number of cells is needed to form the struc￾tures. This hypothesis is supported by our in vivo observation
that CD11b+ macrophages in the control corneal stroma, which
were few in number, formed many fewer lymphatic structures
than after suture placement, when the number of macrophages
increased dramatically (Figure 4).
This report provides strong evidence that a subpopulation of
CD11b+ macrophages has lymphatic endothelial characteristics
and may be involved in the induction of pathological lymphan￾giogenesis. Moreover, the critical role for inflammation in cor￾neal lymphangiogenesis raises significant questions about the
role of inflammatory macrophages in the development of lym￾phatic vessels in other tissues and organs. While we cannot rule
out the possibility that a rare cell type or a cell with an unusual
pattern of marker expression exists in the population of cells that
produce lymphatic vessels, we feel that therapeutic prevention of
macrophage activation might prove to successfully prolong cor￾Figure 5

neal graft survival. It is possible that macrophages surrounding
tumors and other sites of inflammation may be involved in the
orchestration of lymphatic vessels; therefore, understanding this
novel mechanism for lymphangiogenesis within the cornea may
have important ramifications for antilymphangiogenesis thera￾pies in the treatment of a variety of diseases.
Methods
Animals. For corneal transplant experiments, male BALB/c and CB17
SCID mice (aged 8–10 weeks) were used as hosts, and age-matched male
BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were the donors (Taconic). Male BALB/c mice
(Taconic) were used in the suture-placement model. All animal protocols
were approved by the Schepens Eye Research Institute Animal Care and
Use Committee in accordance with NIH guidelines and the Association
for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology’s Statement for the Use of
Animals in Ophthalmologic and Vision Research.
Mouse corneal transplantation and corneal suture placement. Prior to PRK, each
animalwas deeply anesthetizedwith an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine
(3 mg) and xylazine (0.007 mg) before the central 2-mm portion ofthe donor
cornea was excised with vannas scissors and secured in recipient graft beds
with 8 interrupted 11-0 nylon sutures (36). Using stromal incursions that
encompassed more than 120° of the corneal circumference, 3 11-0 nylon
sutures were placed intrastromally. To obtain a standardized angiogenic
response,the outer edge ofthe suturewas placed halfway between the limbus
and the line outlined by the 2-mm trephine; the inner edge was equidistant
from the 2-mm trephine. Sutures were left in place for 7 days.
Whole-mount corneal staining and morphological determination of hemangiogen￾esis and lymphangiogenesis. Mice were euthanized on day 3 or 7 after PKP.
The corneas were excised, rinsed 3 times in PBS, and fixed in acetone for 1
hour. They were then rinsed once in PBS, blocked with 2% BSA-PBS, incu￾bated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 antibody (1:500;
a kind gift of D.G. Jackson, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom)
(8, 37) and rabbit anti-mouse Prox-1 antibody (1:500; Upstate). The tissues
were then washed, blocked, and stained overnight with FITC-conjugated
CD11b (1:100; BD Biosciences — Pharmingen), purified CD11c (1:100; BD
Biosciences — Pharmingen), and FITC-conjugated CD31 (PECAM-1, 1:100;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies and finallywashed, blocked, and
stained with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100; Jackson Immu￾noResearch Laboratories). For isotype control of CD11b, rat (DA) IgG2b,κ
(BD Biosciences — Pharmingen) was used. Double-stained whole-mount
sections were analyzed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and a Leica
TSC-SP2 inverted and upright confocal laser-scanning microscope. Digital
pictures of the flat mounts were taken using a spot image analysis system
(SPOT Advanced version 3.2, Diagnostic Instruments Inc.), and the area
covered by blood and lymphatic vessels positive for CD31/LYVE-1 (8, 37)
was measured using NIH ImageJ version 1.33u (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
The total corneal area was outlined using the innermost vessel of the lim￾bal arcade as the border; the area of blood and lymphatic neovasculariza￾tion within the cornea was calculated and normalized to the total corneal
area (expressed as the percentage of the cornea covered by vessels).
Corneal explant cultures. An area 2 mm in diameter was excised from the
mouse central cornea, rinsed 3 times with PBS, placed epithelium side–up

in the well of 96-well dishes containing 10% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng
IL-1β (BD Biosciences — Pharmingen), and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg
streptomycin (Biowhitaker) in DMEM medium (Biowhitaker), and incu￾bated for 48–72 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cornea was
stained with LYVE-1 and CD31 using the method described for whole￾mount corneal staining.
Irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. Male C57BL/6 mice, aged 7–8
weeks, were transplanted with bone marrow from transgenic mice express￾ing various promoters, including EGFP and Tie2-LacZ (38).
Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing the tibias and femurs
of age-matched donor EGFP transgenic mice (C57BL/6-TgN [ACT￾bEGFP] 10sb; The Jackson Laboratory) and Tie2-LacZ transgenic
mice (C57BL/6-TgN [TIE2LacZ] 182Sato; The Jackson Laboratory).
Low-density mononuclear bone marrow cells were isolated by density
gradient centrifugation over Histopaque-1083 (Sigma-Aldrich). Eight
weeks after bone marrow transplantation, when the bone marrow of the
recipients was considered to be completely reconstituted (27), the mice
underwent corneal suturing.
Detection of bone marrow cells positive for EGFP and double-positive for 
LYVE-1 and β-gal expression in corneal tissue. The mice were euthanized,
and their corneas were excised along the limbus area. A modified flat￾mount double immunohistochemistry technique was used in which
corneal flat mounts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then
blocked and stained with LYVE-1 (1:500) (8, 37) visualized with Cy3-
conjugated secondary antibody (1:100), and blocked and stained with
anti-rabbit polyclonal β-galactosidase antibody (1:300; Jackson Immu￾noResearch Laboratories) (39) visualized with Cy2-conjugated second￾ary antibody (1:100) and protected with Vectorshields (Vector Labora￾tories) for fluorescence detection. Tissues were examined with a Leica
TSC-SP2 inverted and upright confocal laser scanning microscope and
a Zeiss Axiophot microscope.
Systemic depletion of macrophages using clodronate liposomes. Systemic deple￾tion of monocytes/macrophages was accomplished as described previously
(40). Cl2MDP (clodronate) liposomes, a gift of Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
was injected via the tail vein 3 days before suture placement, at the time of
suture placement, and 3 and 7 days after surgery. Control mice received
liposomes containing PBS at the same time points.
Collection and culture of macrophages from the peritoneal cavity. Thiogly￾collate-induced macrophages (PECs) were collected from the peritoneal
cavity of normal 8-week-old male C57BL/6 and EGFP mice (41). PECs
were washed, resuspended, and cultured (106 cells/plate, 24 hours at
37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere) in 35-mm culture plates in RPMI-1640
medium containing 10% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 × 10-5 M 2-ME (mer￾captoethanol; Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM nonessential
amino acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin (Biowhitaker).
Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and RT-PCR analysis of PECs. Nonad￾herent cells were removed, and adherent cells were harvested by scraping
from the culture dish. The cells were rinsed in PBS, incubated for 10 min￾utes on ice with CD16/CD32 Fc block (BD Biosciences — Pharmingen)
in 2% bovine serum–PBS, and stained for 30 minutes on ice with FITC￾conjugated CD11b, nonfluorescence-conjugated LYVE-1, podoplanin
(Research Diagnostics Inc.), Prox-1, and isotype controls (FITC-conju￾gated nonspecific rat IgG2b, PE-conjugated hamster IgG, nonconjugated
rabbit IgG; BD Biosciences — Pharmingen). For the LYVE-1, Prox-1, and
rabbit isotype controls, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary anti￾Figure 7

body was used; for podoplanin, Cy3-conjugated goat anti–Syrian hamster
secondary antibody was used. Labeled cells were analyzed on an EPIC XL
flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). For multicolor analysis, the analysis
gate was only set to detect FITC-CD11b+ cells.
For immunocytochemistry, CD11b+ PECs in the tissue culture dishes
were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 7 minutes, rinsed
with PBS, blocked in 2% BSA containing 0.1% Triton-X–PBS, stained
with LYVE-1 (1:500), podoplanin (1:500), or Prox-1 (1:500), rinsed, and
blocked as described above, stained with FITC-conjugated CD11b (1:250)
and Cy3-conjugated (1:500) secondary antibodies, washed with PBS, and
covered with a Vectorshield with DAPI applied for fluorescence. Analysis
was performed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. For RT-PCR analy￾sis, total RNA from PECs was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen Corp.).
First-strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA by reverse transcriptase
using oligo (dT) primers. For the detection of VEGF-C, primers expressing
VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 were used in the RT-PCR (4).
Assay of tube formation using CD11b+ PECs. Only adherent cells that
expressed CD11b were used in the tube-formation assay. Growth fac￾tor–reduced Matrigel (100 µl; BD) prepared from an Engelbreth-Holm￾Swarm tumor was added to 4-chamber slides (Lab-Tek; Nunc) with 100 µl
endothelial cell medium (EBM-2; Cambrex Corp.) and allowed to gel for 30
minutes at 37°C. PECs were seeded at densities of 105, 2 × 105, 5 × 105, 106,
and 2 × 106 cells/ml in 500 µl of EBM-2 containing 3% FBS. Tube forma￾tion was monitored over 31 days.
Digital pictures were taken using a spot image analysis system, and the
area covered by both aggregate and tube-like structures were measured
using NIH Image software at 48 hours. The total area covered by the
Matrigel was outlined (18 mm2); the area of the aggregate and the tube-like
structures within the Matrigel was calculated and expressed as a percentage
of the Matrigel area. Exogenous VEGF-C (100 ng/ml; Research Diagnostics
Inc.) was added to the gel assay, and 24 hours later the clusters and tube￾like structures were assayed as described above.
Detection of LYVE-1 and podoplanin expression in tube-like structures. CD11b+
PECs were stained for the presence of LYVE-1 and podoplanin at D7 and
D31 afterthe establishment of Matrigel cultures. CD11b+ PECsin Matrigel
were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 7 minutes, rinsed in
PBS, blocked in 2%BSAcontaining 0.1%Triton-X–PBS,stainedwith LYVE-1
(1:500) and podoplanin (1:500), washed, blocked, stained with Cy3-conju￾gated secondary antibody (1:500), washed with PBS, and covered with Vec￾torshields for fluorescence detection. Analysis was performed with a Zeiss
Axiophot microscope and a Leica TSC-SP2 inverted and upright confocal
laser scanning microscope.
Transmission electron microscopy. The Matrigel samples were fixed with 1:1
Karnovsky fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde) and post￾fixed in osmium tetroxide. The samples then were dehydrated with 50%,
70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol and propylene oxide prior to embedding in
epoxy (embed 812). The grids were stained with lead citrate and uranyl
acetate. Samples were cut and observed under a Philips 410 TEM.
Statistical analysis. Statisticalsignificance was determined using the Mann
Whitney U test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Each
experiment was performed at least twice with similar results. Graphs were
drawn using StatView version 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc.).
