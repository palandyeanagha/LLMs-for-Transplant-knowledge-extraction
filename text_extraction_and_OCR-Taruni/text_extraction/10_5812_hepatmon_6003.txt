Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
Biliary complications occur in a nameable percentage of liver transplant recipients. They represent a significant source of morbid￾ity. Therefore, early diagnostic and management of these complications should be the goal for the physicians. Ultrasound is the 
first diagnostic tool in detection of biliary complications in many centers. It has a low side effect profile and it is ubiquity available. 
The data of our study show that by a proper examination ultrasound is a helpful method for excluding patients without biliary 
complications. We believe that these data are therefore of interest for hepatologists and the transplant community.
Background: Biliary complications are significant source of morbidity after liver trans￾plantation (LT). Cholangiography is the gold standard for diagnosis and specification of 
biliary complications.
Objectives: Detailed analyses of ultrasound (US) as a safe imaging method in this regard 
are still lacking. Therefore we analyzed systematically the diagnostic value of US in these 
patients.
Patients and Methods: Retrospectively, 128 liver graft recipients and their clinical data 
were analyzed. All patients had a standardized US examination. The findings of US were 
compared to cholangiographic results in 42 patients. Following statistical analyses were 
performed: descriptive statistics, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
values (PPV, NPV).
Results: 42 patients had 54 different biliary complications (Anastomotic stenosis (AS) n 
= 33, ischemic type biliary lesions (ITBL) n = 18 and leakage n = 3). US detected n = 22/42 
(52%) patients with biliary complications. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of US 
were: 61%, 100%, 100%, 79% (95CI, 36-86%) for ITBL and 24%, 100, 100%, 31% (95CI, 9-46 %) for 
AS, respectively
Conclusions: US examination had no false positive rate. Therefore, it may be helpful as 
a first screening modality. But for the direct diagnosis of the biliary complication US is 
not sensitive enough. Published by Kowsar Corp, 2012. cc 3.0.

1. Background
Biliary complications occur in 9-35 % of liver transplant 
recipients (1-8). It is reported as an uncommon cause of 
mortality, but represent a significant source of morbid￾ity (9). Many authors differentiate clinically between the 
early and late biliary complications. Early complications 
such as leaks and strictures have often technical causes 
and occur predominantly within the first three months 
after LT. Late complications are more likely to be complex 
and have multiple causes (9). Cholangiography methods 
such as endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogra￾phy (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangio￾drainage (PTCD) are the diagnostic and interventional 
standards in this regard. The ERC (P) (Endoscopic retro￾grade cholangio (pancreatography)) is the method of 
choice in patients with duct-to-duct reconstruction. PTCD 
is usually preferred for patients with a biliodigestive 
anastomosis if balloon enteroscopic approach fails (9). 
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) 
is reported as a reliable diagnostic tool in detection and 
exclusion of biliary complications (10). The low spatial 
resolution and interference due to superposition of extra 
hepatic fluid are limitations of this method (10). Further 
limitations are high costs, claustrophobia and contrast 
agent associated complications such as Nephrogenic Sys￾temic Fibrosis. Ultrasound (US) is the first diagnostic tool 
in many centers. There are only few published studies re￾garding to the diagnostic value of US in detection of bili￾ary tract complications after LT. In older studies, remark￾able ultrasound findings were reported to be predictive 
for the cholangiographic diagnosis of biliary obstruction 
or the generalized ductal changes with a specificity of 98 
% and 100 % respectively (11). The sensitivity of US in direct 
detection of biliary complications is reported, in a single 
publication so far, as very low (12). 
2. Objectives
The aim of this study was therefore to investigate sys￾tematically the diagnostic value of ultrasound in direct 
detection of biliary complications in liver recipients.
3. Patients and Methods
The study protocol was designed according to the dec￾laration of Helsinki 2008. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all included patients. For this study we 
analyzed retrospectively, based on the hospital electronic 
data bank, all liver recipients between January first 2005 
through December 31th 2006 recruited primarily. A total 
of 189 adult patients received liver grafts through this 
time period. The inclusion criterions for this studywas 
an ultrasound examination after liver transplantation 
independent from the time point or reason of the ultra￾sound examination. Therefore we excluded 49 patients 
without documented ultrasound examination after LT 
Then we looked for those patients who had a cholangiog￾raphy. The indication for cholangiography was provided 
by the patient history and clinical data independent 
from their ultrasound results. We compared the results 
of cholangiography as the gold standard method with 
ultrasound findings. The exclusion criterion was a time 
interval longer than four weeks between the ultrasound 
examination and the cholangiography. Therefore 12 more 
patients were excluded. The final analysis was therefore 
performed with the remaining 128 patients, from them 
42 had both US and cholangiography. Due to the clinical 
course of our department, all ultrasound examinations 
were performed before the cholangiography examina￾tion. Therefore, the sonographers were blinded to results 
of the cholangiography but not to the clinical results. 
All patients were examined by gastroenterologists with 
DEGUM (German association of ultrasound in medicine) 
level II to III ultrasound training using ultrasound equip￾ment Aplio (Toshiba, Japan), Sonoline Antares (Siemens, 
Germany) and Elegra Sonoline Advanced (Siemens, Ger￾many) with convex arrays C 3-6 MHz (Toshiba, Japan), 
CH4-1 and three, five C40H (Siemens, Germany), respec￾tively. Systematic B-mode examinations of all abdomi￾nal organs including retro peritoneum were performed 
routinely. The examinations mode for all organs were per￾formed following the recommendations of the German 
Association of Ultrasound in Medicine (DEGUM). Color 
Doppler and duplex measurements of the right hepatic 
artery and the portal vein were performed in an oblique 
intercostal array position and during mid-inspiration 
with the patient’s right arm abducted. Maximum veloc￾ity of the portal vein [(P) Vmax (Maximum velocity of the 
portal vein)], peak systolic velocity of the hepatic artery 
[(A) Vmax (Maximum systolic velocity)], end diastolic ve￾locity of the hepatic artery [(A) Vmin (Maximum end dia￾stolic velocity)] and resistive index of the hepatic artery 
RI (Resistance index) were measured in front and behind 
the anastomosis in each case. Settings such as gain filter 
and pulse-repetition frequencies were adjusted as needed 
for optimal signal detection to prevent artifacts. Types of 
biliary complications and pathologies According to the 
biliary complications literature were defined as follow￾ing: Anastomotic stenosis (AS), ischemic type biliary lesion 
(ITBL) and leakage (9). The definition of biliary complica￾tions on cholangiography is reported as following (13):
3.1. AS on Cholangiography 
Stricture with narrowing of the biliary lumen of com￾mon bile duct CBD (Common bile duct) at the level of the 
anastomosis.
3.2. ITBL on Cholangiography
Single or multiple strictures of the biliary tree in liver 
transplant recipients. Type I: extra hepatic lesion, Type 
II: intrahepatic lesion, Type III: extra- and intrahepatic le￾sion.

3.3. Leakage on Cholangiography
Extravasations of contrast agent after injection into the 
biliary tree. The definition for biliary complications on 
ERCP followed the advice of published studies (13-15). The 
definition of biliary complications on US has been stated 
only partially (16). We defined them as follows: 
3.4. AS on US
Bile duct dilatation intra (> 3mm) and / or extra hepatic 
(> 10mm) on either anastomosis sides of CBD (Figure 1a 
and b).
3.5. ITBL on US
Bile ducts with thickened wall and / or presence of ma￾terial in lumen, with or without consecutive dilatation 
(Figure 2a and b).
3.6. Leakage on US
Liquid formation in liver hilum and or sub capsular 
region with ascites. Confirmation of bilirubin in fluid 
collection after US-guided fluid aspiration. In this study 
we differentiated between biliary complications and gen￾eral biliary pathologies. Biliary pathologies on US were 
defined as: Cholangitis, intrahepatic dilatation, extra 
hepatic dilatation, change of the wall of the bile ducts, 
sludge, stone, abscess, stent or aerobilia in the bile ducts. 
3.7. Statistical Analysis
The statistical evaluation was performed using the sta￾tistical package for social sciences for Windows™ (SPSS). 
Descriptive statistics were performed. Mean values and 
standard deviations (mean ± SD) of parametric data 
were analyzed and compared using T-test. Correlations 
were performed using Pearson correlation test (r = cor￾relations factor). Finally, sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value PPV (Positive predictive value) and nega￾tive predictive value NPV (Negative predictive value) were 
calculated using cross tabulations. The analysis was per￾formed on a patient by patient basis. 
4. Results
4.1. Descriptive Statistics
128 patients (54 % males, mean age 50 years) were in￾cluded in the analysis; Main indications for LT (Liver 
transplantation) were viral hepatitis 24 %, alcoholic liver 
disease 19 % and PSC (Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis) (18 
%). clinical data of the patients are shown in Table 1. The 
ultrasound findings are demonstrated in Table 2. Table 3 
demonstrates the mean value of laboratory data in the 
group of patients with and without biliary complica￾tions. The mean value of ALT (Alanin aminotransferase), 
AST (Aspartate aminotransferase), ALP (Alkaline phospha￾tase), GGT (Gamma glytamyl transferase) and bilirubin 
were significantly higher in the group of patients with 
biliary complications. A total of 42 Patients have been 
received a comparable US and cholangiography. The US 
was able to detect a biliary complication in 22 (52.4 %) of 
them. The US was also helpful in detection of gross gen￾eral biliary pathologies (Table 4).
4.2. Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV and NPV

cholangiography in detection of biliary complications in

liver recipients. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV 
of US for detection of ITBL were 61 %, 100 %, 100 % and 79 
% (95CI (Confidence Interval), 36-86 %), respectively. The 
sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of US for detection of 
AS were 24 %, 100, 100 % and 31 % (95CI, 9-46 %), respective￾ly. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of US for detec￾tion of leakage were 67 %, 98 %, 67 % and 98 % (95CI, 9-99 %) 
respectively. 
4.3. Discrepancy Between US and Cholangiography
In two cases (4,7 %), the biliary complication was detect￾ed only on US: In one case the diagnosis of diffuse ITBL 
was missed by ERCP, while US could detect the thickening 
of the small bile ducts without dilatations; the definite 
diagnosis of ITBL was then confirmed with ERCP later and 
histologically after re-transplantation (Figure 3a and b). 
In the second case with status post hepaticojejunostomy,

not be performed due to absence of intra hepatic biliary 
dilatation. The diagnosis of ITBL was also proven by histol￾ogy after surgical resection and porto-jejunostomy. These 
two cases are not considered in the analysis because the 
gold standard was cholangiography. On the other hand, 
from 22 patients with biliary complications on US 7 (16, 
6 %) patients were diagnosed only on cholangiography 
and were missed completely by US: five cases with AS and 
two cases with ITBL. In 3 of 5 patients with AS no intrahe￾patic dilatation of the bile ducts was seen on ultrasound 
(Figure 4a and b). The corresponding ERCP diagnosed dis￾creet and rough stenosis in two cases and mild stenosis 
in one case (no bile duct narrowing on ERCP, difficulty of 
passage from the anastomosis with the blocked balloon 
or delayed outflow of contrast medium above the level 
of the anastomosis). In the other two cases the examiner 
did not notice the caliber difference of CBD at the level of 
the anastomosis. From the two missed ITBL cases, in one 
patient the ITBL was developed only in the left biliary sys￾tem and in the second case a diffuse ITBL without domi￾nant dilatation was present. Usually all patients with bili￾ary complications receive routine follow up every three 
months in our department. All seven patients who were 
primarily missed by US had detectable sonographic signs 
of biliary complications after three months. In 15 from 22 
patients with biliary complications on US, this method 
was able to detect at least one complication which led to 
further investigations and verification of other compli￾cations.

4.4. Correlation Between Vascular and Biliary Compli￾cations
A total of 19 cases showed remarkable vascular changes 
on US: 11 in the portal or venous anastomoses and eight 
in the arterial anastomoses. We could not show any cor￾relations between the frequency of biliary complications 
and RI (r = 0.025, P = 0.8) or vascular complications such 
as portal vein thrombosis/stenosis (r = 0.03, P = 0.7) and 
thrombosis/stenosis of the arterial anastomosis (r = 
0.095, P = 0.3). From eight patients with arterial compli￾cations, six (75 %) developed biliary complications. All six 
patients developed ITBL and two cases had additionally 
an anastomotic stenosis. Patients with selective compli￾cations of the portal anastomosis showed no biliary com￾plications (n = 11).
4.5. Additional Biliary Pathologies Apart From Biliary 
Complications Seen by US
Apart from biliary complications, in 11 cases (8.6 %) ul￾trasound could detect further biliary pathologies with￾out the necessity of cholangiography intervention. In 
10 patients ultrasound suggested a cholangitis. The 
diagnosis was confirmed with the clinical picture, bio￾chemical, other imaging modalities and follow up. In 
one case with PSC as underlying disease, US were the only 
method which could diagnose CCC (Cholangiocellular 
carcinoma) recurrence after LT through US + FNA. MRCP 
(Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) and CT 
(Computed tomography) missed the diagnosis. 
5. Discussion
US are the considered method of first choice for detec￾tion of biliary obstructions with consecutive dilatation of 
the bile duct since 20 years ago (17-19). Older studies have 
reported general sensitivity of 54 % for US in the detection 
of biliary pathologies after LT (20). Despite the fact some 
newer publications could prove sensitivity around 80 % 
(21, 22). Published data regarding the sensitivity of US in 
direct detection of biliary complications are very rare. Zo￾epf et al. reported a sensitivity of 68.4 % and 58.8 % for US 
in detection of biliary dilatation as indirect sign of AS and 
ITBL, respectively (12). After comparison of US, CT and MRI 
(Magnetic resonance imaging) for direct specification of 
the complications, the calculated sensitivities decrease to 
0 %, 10 % and 22 %, respectively and was very low for all mo￾Figure 5. Screening Algorithm for Detection of Biliary Complications After Liver Transplantation
a Segmental intra hepatic dilatations or common bile duct dilatations which is asymptomatic without any patho￾logical biochemical tests should be controlled with US in follow up. 
b While the thickened wall of the bile ducts due to acute cholangitis disappears after antibiotic therapy it does not 
change in case of ischemic type biliary lesions (ITBL). This recommendation makes no claim to be complete and 
they do not account for rarities.

dalities (12). A direct comparison of our data to the study 
mentioned is not possible because Zoepf et al. considered 
only bile duct dilatation- which is an indirect sign of a 
biliary complication- as the only sonographic evidence 
for a biliary complication. For direct diagnosis of biliary 
complications in this study, the US examination was not 
sensitive enough. 14.1 % from all liver recipients and 42.9 
% of all patients with biliary complications on cholangi￾ography developed ITBL after LT. The sensitivity of US in 
detection of ITBL was 61 %. On the other hand in 4.8 % of 
the cases the diagnosis of ITBL was delayed by cholangi￾ography and could be predicted by US only. In this study 
US had an impact of 66 % in detection of ITBL in the af￾fected patients. Again 25.8 % of the transplanted popula￾tion of this study developed an AS, which was the most 
frequent biliary complication (78.9 %) in our analysis as 
reported by other authors (23). For detection of AS, ultra￾sound had a very low sensitivity of 24 %. One explanation 
for the low sensitivity of US in detection of anastomosis 
stenosis might be the lack of systematic examination in 
some patients. In many of the missed cases in this study 
the CBD was examined only on one side. However, to de￾tect stenosis of the anastomosis reliably, it is essential to 
examine the CBD on the donor and the recipient sides. 
The caliber difference of CBD pre and post anastomosis 
should always alert us to the diagnosis of AS. Slight and 
early stenosis on ERCP does not cause a dilatation of the 
bile ducts immediately. Due to the denervation of the im￾planted liver, it takes usually up to three months or more 
for development of a dilatation of the bile duct system 
that could be detected by US or other imaging modali￾ties. This fact may be another explanation for limitations 
of US examination in this regard. The number of leakages 
and other rare complications in this study was too small 
for a reliable statistical analysis. Therefore an objective 
rating of US in this regard could not be performed. 
Limitation of this study is its retrospective character. 
Therefore the US and endoscopy diagnoses were not 
based on standardized protocols. We have tried to mini￾mize this limitation by standardizing the findings of the 
imaging modalities retrospectively by clear definitions 
of the biliary pathologies. Based on the analyzed data we 
recommend the following screening algorithm for veri￾fication of biliary complications in liver recipients on US 
(Figure 5). This algorithm is only for orientation and does 
not consider all biliary pathologies. The data of this study 
show that US examination has a high specificity in detec￾tion of biliary pathologies. Therefore, it may be helpful 
as a first screening modality. But for direct diagnosis of 
the biliary complications it is not sensitive enough. In 
non-conclusive cases, if clinically possible, a repeating 
US examination after three months leads to a better veri￾fication of the pathologies of the biliary system. We pre￾sented an algorithm with low side effects and favorable 
cost profile for screening of liver recipients with biliary 
complications.
