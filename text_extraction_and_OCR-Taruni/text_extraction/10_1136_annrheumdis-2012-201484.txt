ABSTRACT
Objectives To increase understanding of the aetiology 
and pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), genetic 
and environmental risk factors for RA subsets, defi ned 
by the presence or absence of different anticitrullinated 
protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs) targeting citrullinated 
peptides from α-enolase, vimentin, fi brinogen and 
collagen type II, were investigated.
Methods 1985 patients with RA and 2252 matched 
controls from the EIRA case-control cohort were used 
in the study. Serum samples were assayed by ELISA for 
the presence of anticyclic citrullinated peptides (anti￾CCP) antibodies and four different ACPA fi ne specifi cities. 
Cross-reactivity between ACPAs was examined by 
peptide absorption experiments. Genotyping was 
performed for HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) alleles and 
the PTPN22 gene, while information regarding smoking 
was obtained by questionnaire. The association of genetic 
and environmental risk factors with different subsets of 
RA was calculated by logistic regression analysis.
Results Limited cross-reactivity was observed between 
different ACPA fi ne specifi cities. In total, 17 RA subsets 
could be identifi ed based on their different ACPA fi ne 
specifi city profi les. Large differences in association with 
genetic and environmental determinants were observed 
between subsets. The strongest association of HLA-DRB1
SE, PTPN22 and smoking was identifi ed for the RA subset 
which was defi ned by the presence of antibodies to 
citrullinated α-enolase and vimentin.
Conclusion This study provides the most 
comprehensive picture to date of how HLA-DRB1 SE, 
PTPN22 and smoking are associated with the presence of 
specifi c ACPA reactivities rather than anti-CCP levels. The 
new data will form a basis for molecular studies aimed 
at understanding disease development in serologically 
distinct subsets of RA.
INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has for many years been 
considered a prototype for immune-mediated dis￾eases owing to the strong genetic association with 
certain MHC class II alleles (ie, HLA-DRB1 shared 
epitope (SE)).1–3 More recently the MHC class II 
association in RA was shown to be confi ned to a 
subset of patients characterised by the presence of 
antibodies to synthetic cyclic citrullinated peptides

(CCP).4 5 The concomitant recognition that the best 
known environmental risk factor for RA (ie, smok￾ing) constitutes a risk only for the development of 
CCP-positive disease, together with the fi nding 
that smoking induces the exposure of citrullinated 
proteins in the lungs,4 6 7 suggests an aetiology for 
RA where HLA-DRB1 SE-restricted immune reac￾tions to citrullinated epitopes trigger and drive 
disease pathogenesis.8 Subsequently, it has been 
shown that the CCP assays such as the most fre￾quently used CCP2 ELISA is able to capture anti￾citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs) 
with a broad spectrum of fi ne specifi cities including 
naturally occurring citrullinated autoantigens.9 10
In order to increase our understanding of the 
aetiology and pathogenesis of RA it has there￾fore become important to defi ne which ACPA 
fi ne specifi cities are associated with the different 
HLA-DRB1 SE alleles. Such studies have been per￾formed for some ACPA fi ne specifi cities11–15 and 
differences within the CCP-positive population 
have been described. However, no comprehen￾sive picture has emerged to date, partly because 
only single target antigens have been studied and 
partly due to small study populations and lack of 
information on appropriate controls. In the present 
study we have used the large and well-character￾ised Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid 
Arthritis (EIRA) case-control cohort16 to investigate 
HLA-DRB1 SE in combination with PTPN22 poly￾morphism—the second most important genetic 
risk factor for CCP-positive RA17—and cigarette 
smoking in relation to the presence of antibodies 
targeting four well-defi ned citrullinated autoanti￾gens (citrullinated α-enolase, -vimentin, -fi brinogen 
and -collagen type II).
METHODS
Subjects
EIRA is an ongoing Swedish population-based 
case-control study which is described in detail else￾where.16 In the present study we analysed 1985 
incident cases of RA included in the EIRA study 
between May 1996 and May 2006 and 2252 con￾trols randomly selected from the national popu￾lation register to match RA cases in terms of age, 
gender and residential area. Cases were diagnosed 
with RA according to the 1987 American College

of Rheumatology criteria.18 Cases and controls donated blood 
at the time of inclusion and completed a self-administered ques￾tionnaire relating to life style and environmental exposures.
ELISA
Anti-CCP antibody status was determined in serum from 1985 
cases and 1210 controls using the CCP2 assay (Immunoscan 
CCPlus, Euro-Diagnostica, Malmö, Sweden) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. The cut-off for positivity was 
25 AU/ml. Antibody responses to citrullinated peptides from 
α-enolase (CEP-1), vimentin (Cit-vim), fi brinogen (Cit-fi b) and 
collagen type II (Cit-C1) or the arginine-containing equivalents 
were assayed in serum samples from 1985 EIRA cases and 150 
randomly selected EIRA controls using an in-house ELISAs, as 
previously described.11 19 The cut-off for positivity was 10 AU/
ml for all ACPA fi ne specifi cities. A detailed description of the 
ELISA method is given in the online supplement.
Cross-reactivity assay
Ten serum samples with high anti-CCP levels (>800 AU/ml) that 
also displayed reactivity to CEP-1 (n=10), Cit-vim (n=8), Cit-fi b 
(n=9) and Cit-C1 (n=8) were selected from EIRA for cross-re￾activity experiments. Each serum (diluted 1:100) was incubated 
with each of the four peptides (CEP-1, Cit-vim, Cit-fi b or Cit-C1) 
at 10 μg/ml or in the presence of buffer alone. Preabsorption 
was performed in liquid phase during constant agitation for 2 
h at room temperature. Following centrifugation (15 min, 1000 
g), the supernatants were transferred to the four peptide ELISA 
plates and assayed as described above. Inhibition was deter￾mined based on the differences in AU/ml values between the 
absorbing peptide and buffer alone.
Peptides
Freeze-dried synthetic peptides (>95% purity) corresponding to 
sequences from human α-enolase (amino acid 5–21), vimentin 
(amino acid 60–75) and fi brinogen (amino acid 36–52) in its ‘native’ 
form or with arginine to citrulline substitutions (Innovagen, 
Lund, Sweden), were dissolved at 10 mg/ml (Milli-Q water, 10% 
DMSO) and stored at −20°C before used. The homotrimeric triple 
helical collagen type II peptides C1 and Cit-C1 were synthesised 
as previously described.20 21 A detailed description of the peptide 
sequences is given in table 1 in the online supplement.
Genotyping
HLA-DRB1 subtyping was performed on DNA samples from 
1961 RA cases and 1278 controls by sequence-specifi c primer 
PCR, as previously described.11 DRB1*01 (except DRB1*0103), 
DRB1*04 and DRB1*10 were classifi ed as shared epitope (SE) 
alleles of HLA-DRB1. The protein tyrosine phosphatase gene 
(PTPN22 rs2476601) was genotyped on 1943 RA cases and 1284 
controls, as previously described.17
Cigarette smoking
Information regarding cigarette smoking prior to the appearance 
of symptoms of arthritis in 1727 RA cases and the corresponding 
time points among 1913 controls were obtained by question￾naire. Individuals were categorised as ever smokers (current/
past) or never smokers.16
Statistical analyses
To determine the association of HLA-DRB1 SE (alone or in com￾bination with PTPN22 and/or smoking) with different subsets 
of RA, ORs with 95% CI were calculated using unconditional 
logistic regression analyses, with cases and controls that were 
negative for the risk factors as the referent category. All analyses 
were performed with adjustment for design variables (age, resi￾dential area and gender).
Interaction, defi ned by departure from additivity of effects,22
was evaluated between HLA-DRB1 SE and smoking and between 
HLA-DRB1 SE and PTPN22. The attributable proportion due to 
interaction (AP) was calculated together with 95% CI, as pre￾viously described.11 23 The AP between two interacting factors 
refl ects the joint effect beyond the sum of the independent 
effects. All analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.1.
Differences in ACPA levels between different RA subsets or 
between absorbing peptides and buffer in the cross-reactivity 
experiment were examined using the Mann–Whitney U test for 
independent groups.
RESULTS
Identifi cation of different RA subsets based on ACPA fi ne 
specifi city profi les
Sixty-three percent of RA cases in EIRA were anti-CCP antibody 
positive (35% anti-CEP-1 positive, 37% anti-Cit-vim positive, 
28% anti-Cit-fi b positive and 37% anti-Cit-C1 positive. Low￾level antibody responses to the arginine-containing control pep￾tides from α-enolase, vimentin and fi brinogen were detected 
in less than 2.4% of patients, while reactivity to the arginine￾containing C1 peptide20 21 24 of collagen type II was detected 
in 9% (data not shown). The presence of different ACPA fi ne 
specifi cities overlapped to a large extent and, by analysing the 
different patterns, 17 serologically distinct subsets could be

absorbed by preincubation with its homologous peptide, while 
only limited cross-reactivity was observed between specifi cities. 
Anti-CEP-1 IgG showed a low degree of cross-reactivity with 
Cit-fi b in some serum samples (p=0.043) but no cross-reactivity 
with Cit-vim or Cit-C1 (fi gure 2A). Anti-Cit-vim IgG showed 
cross-reactivity with Cit-fi b in two serum samples (fi gure 
2B). Anti-Cit-fi b IgG showed some degree of cross-reactivity 
with CEP-1 in some serum samples (p=0.05, fi gure 2C) and 
anti-Cit-C1 antibodies showed cross-reactivity mainly with 
Cit-fi b in approximately half of the serum samples (p<0.001, 
fi gure 2D).
HLA-DRB1 SE in combination with PTPN22 and smoking is 
associated mainly with CEP-1 and Cit-vim positive RA
To investigate associations of genetic and environmental risk 
factors with different subsets of RA, we fi rst defi ned RA sub￾sets by the presence or absence of antibodies to single citrul￾linated peptides—that is, without taking into account which 
additional ACPA fi ne specifi cities may also be present in the 
subset. As shown in fi gure 3A, being positive for HLA-DRB1 SE, 
PTPN22 and smoking was associated mainly with CEP-1 posi￾tive RA (OR 39.1) compared with CEP-1 negative/CCP positive 
RA (OR 7.9). A similar pattern was observed for antibodies to 
Cit-vim where the association of HLA-DRB1 SE in combination 
with PTPN22 and smoking was stronger with Cit-vim positive 
disease OR 25.6 compared with Cit-vim negative/CCP positive 
identifi ed (fi gure 1A). Most of the patients who were positive 
for the specifi c ACPAs were confi ned to the CCP-positive popu￾lation, although 18% of CCP-negative patients were positive for 
at least one ACPA fi ne specifi city (fi gure 1B). Conversely, 8.7% 
of all patients were CCP-positive but negative for the four ACPA 
fi ne specifi cities.
In the CCP-negative population, ACPA-positive patients 
typically showed reactivity to only one citrullinated antigen 
where anti-Cit-C1 antibodies were dominant (9.45%). In the 
CCP-positive subset, on the other hand, the presence of two 
(16.6%), three (13.4%) or four (11%) ACPA fi ne specifi cities was 
common. ACPA fi ne specifi city levels were generally lower in 
the CCP-negative population than in the CCP-positive popula￾tion (data not shown). Moreover, there was a strong correlation 
between the number of ACPAs present and anti-CCP antibody 
levels, with a signifi cant (p<0.0001) increase in anti-CCP anti￾body levels for every additional ACPA fi ne specifi city (see fi gure 
1 in online supplement).
ACPAs show limited cross-reactivity
In order to analyse the extent of cross-reactivity between anti￾bodies reactive with the different citrullinated peptides, serum 
samples from 10 CCP-positive RA patients with antibodies to 
CEP-1 (n=10), Cit-vim (n=8), Cit-fi b (n=9) and Cit-C1 (n=8) 
were preabsorbed against each of the four peptides before being 
retested for ACPA reactivities. All four ACPAs were effi ciently

peptides from α-enolase (CEP-1), vimentin (Cit-vim), fi brinogen (Cit-fi b) and collagen type II (Cit-C1) were measured in serum samples from 10 
patients with cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA1–RA10) after preabsorption with the different peptides: (A) anti￾CEP-1 IgG levels; (B) anti-Cit-vim IgG levels; (C) anti-Cit-fi b IgG levels; (D) anti-Cit-C1 IgG levels. Serum samples that were negative for one or several

Impact of HLA-DRB1 SE on disease risk in different RA subsets
The results described above may be infl uenced by the coexis￾tence of multiple ACPA fi ne specifi cities. We next investigated 
the four RA subsets which were defi ned by the sole presence of 
one ACPA fi ne specifi city—that is, the subsets that were ‘single 
positive’ for anti-CEP-1, anti-Cit-vim, anti-Cit-fi b or anti-Cit-C1 
antibodies. In this analysis we focused on HLA-DRB1 SE, the 
risk factor with the strongest impact. We found a relatively 
strong association of HLA-DRB1 SE with CEP-1 positive RA (OR 
5.1) as well as with Cit-vim positive disease (OR 6.0) but not 
with Cit-fi b positive disease (OR 1.4), and the association with 
Cit-C1 positive RA was weak (OR 1.6) (table 1). A signifi cant 
association of HLA-DRB1 SE (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.6) could 
also be observed with the subset that was positive for CCP but 
negative for all four ACPA fi ne specifi cities (data not shown).
We then studied the effect of being positive for different 
combinations of two ACPA fi ne specifi cities as the impact of 
HLA-DRB1 SE may differ between subsets defi ned by specifi c 
combinations of non-cross-reactive ACPAs. The strongest infl u￾ence of HLA-DRB1 SE was identifi ed for CEP-1/Cit-vim double￾positive RA (OR 49.6) which could be compared with an OR 
of 2.5 for the association with Cit-fi b/Cit-C1 double-positive 
RA. Interestingly, anti-CCP antibody levels were higher in the 
Cit-fi b/Cit-C1 double-positive subset than in the CEP-1/Cit-vim 
double-positive subset, suggesting that HLA-DRB1 SE mainly 
infl uence the fi ne specifi city of the ACPA response rather than 
anti-CCP levels (see fi gure 2 in online supplement).
disease OR 8.9, fi gure 3B). Subsets defi ned by antibodies to Cit￾fi b or Cit-C1, on the other hand, did not demonstrate such spe￾cifi c associations beyond the effect of CCP (OR 15.6 vs 12.9 for 
Cit-fi b and 10.0 vs 13.8 for Cit-C1; fi gure 3C,D).
Figure 3 Combined effect of HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and smoking 
on disease risk in different subsets of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ORs 
with 95% CI were calculated using unconditional logistic regression 
analysis by comparing individuals positive for the risk factors with 
individuals who were negative. RA subsets were defi ned based on the 
presence or absence of one anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibody 
(ACPA) fi ne specifi city without taking into account which other ACPA 
fi ne specifi cities may be present simultaneously. Antibody responses to 
citrullinated peptides from (A) α-enolase (CEP-1), (B) vimentin (Cit-vim), 
(C) fi brinogen (Cit-fi b) and (D) collagen type II (Cit-C1). White bars show 
subsets negative for the ACPA fi ne specifi city and negative for cyclic 
citrullinated peptide (CCP) (−/−); grey bars show subsets negative 
for the ACPA fi ne specifi city but positive for CCP (−/+); black bars 
show subsets positive for the ACPA fi ne specifi city but where the CCP 
status was not considered (+/ + or −). 95% CIs for −/+ and +/+

Impact of PTPN22 in combination with HLA-DRB1 SE on disease 
risk in RA subsets 
We then investigated the combined effect of HLA-DRB1 SE 
and PTPN22 in subsets defi ned by anti-CEP-1, anti-Cit-vim and 
anti-Cit-C1 antibody status. As seen with smoking, PTPN22
also mainly had an effect in the presence of HLA-DRB1 SE, and 
this association was also most pronounced for double-positive 
and triple-positive subsets encompassing anti-CEP-1 antibod￾ies. Addition of Cit-vim reactivity to the CEP-1 single-positive 
subset increased the OR for the combined HLA-DRB1 SE and 
PTPN22 association from 8.7 to 29.2 while addition of Cit-C1 
to the CEP-1 single positive subset changed the OR from 8.7 
to 17.1. However, similar ORs were observed for the Cit-vim 
single-positive and the Cit-vim/Cit-C1 double-positive subsets 
(8.4 vs 8.7). The strongest association (OR 34.8) of the HLA￾DRB1 SE and PTPN22 combination was seen with the triple￾positive subset (CEP-1+/Cit-vim+/Cit-C1+) (see table 2 in online 
supplement).
Combined effect of HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and smoking on 
disease risk in RA subsets defi ned by anti-CEP-1 and anti-Cit-vim 
antibody status
In the fi nal analysis we investigated the combined effect of all 
three risk factors (HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and smoking) and 
calculated gene–environment and gene–gene interactions. We 
focused on what appears to be the two most important ACPA 
fi ne specifi cities in this context and defi ned RA subgroups based 
on CEP-1 and Cit-vim reactivity alone (table 3). The presence 
of HLA-DRB1 SE alleles, PTPN22 polymorphism and cigarette 
smoking conferred a rather modest risk for the development of 
CEP-1 negative/Cit-vim negative disease (OR 2.4), while the risk 
was high for CEP-1 positive/Cit-vim negative RA (OR 24.4) and 
for CEP-1 negative/Cit-vim positive RA (OR 11.5). However, 
the highest risk was identifi ed for the CEP-1/Cit-vim double￾positive subset (OR 50.1).
Analyses of interaction, calculated as the AP,22 23 demon￾strated signifi cant interactions between HLA-DRB1 SE and 
smoking in the CEP-1 positive/Cit-vim negative as well as in the 
CEP-1/Cit-vim double-positive subsets with AP values of 0.33 
and 0.64, respectively. Interactions were also observed between 
HLA-DRB1 SE and PTPN22 in the CEP-1 positive/Cit-vim nega￾tive (AP=0.44), the CEP-1 negative/Cit-vim positive (AP=0.56) 
and in the CEP-1/Cit-vim double positive subsets (AP=0.53) (see 
table 3 in online supplement).
DISCUSSION
The present study provides novel data concerning the relation￾ships between specifi c autoimmune reactions and genetic and 
environmental determinants for the risk of developing RA, with 
the overall conclusion that HLA-DRB1 SE genes, the PTPN22
risk allele and cigarette smoking are associated with the pres￾ence of specifi c ACPA-reactivities rather than total levels of anti￾CCP antibodies.
We have focused our analyses on antibody responses to well￾defi ned citrullinated epitopes on α-enolase,25 26 vimentin,13 27
fi brinogen28 29 and collagen type II,21 representing physiological 
antigens present in the rheumatoid joint. Most of the patients 
who were positive for these ACPA fi ne specifi cities were also 
positive in the CCP2 ELISA, the current standard assay for 
ACPA detection. Although important to note, 18% of the CCP 
negative patients were positive for at least one ACPA fi ne speci￾fi city. Conversely, nearly 14% of the CCP positive patients were 
negative for the four ACPA fi ne specifi cities, and this subset also 
Impact of smoking in combination with HLA-DRB1 SE on disease 
risk in RA subsets
Since the data presented above do not support an association 
of HLH-DRB1 SE with the presence of anti-Cit-fi b antibodies, 
we restricted the next analysis to RA subgroups defi ned by the 
presence or absence of antibodies to CEP-1, Cit-vim and Cit-C1. 
We had suffi cient power to investigate the combined effect of 
HLA-DRB1 SE and smoking. As shown in table 2, smoking in 
the absence of HLA-DRB1 SE did not signifi cantly associate 
with any RA subset but strengthened the HLA-DRB1 SE asso￾ciation when present. This effect was most pronounced for 
double-positive and triple-positive subsets compared with sin￾gle-positive subsets, but only when anti-CEP-1 antibodies were 
present. Adding Cit-vim reactivity to the CEP-1 single-posi￾tive subset increased the OR for the combined HLA-DRB1 SE 
and smoking association from 12.5 to 18.4. A similar effect 
was seen when adding Cit-C1 reactivity to the CEP-1 single￾positive subset, with an increase in the OR from 12.5 to 17.2. 
However, in the absence of anti-CEP-1 antibodies, addition 
of Cit-C1 reactivity to the Cit-vim single-positive subgroup 
did not increase the OR further (7.3 vs 5.6). The highest 
OR (23.3) for the combined HLA-DRB1 SE and smoking 
association was observed for the triple-positive subset (CEP-1+/
Cit-vim+/Cit-C1+).

showed some association with HLA-DRB1 SE, clearly indicating 
that other ACPA targets exist, which has also been reported pre￾viously25 30 31 and should be considered in future studies.
Our peptide absorption experiments showed that the ACPAs 
were mainly non-cross-reactive. Although some degree of cross￾reactivity was observed in some serum samples, the majority 
did not demonstrate cross-reactivity, in line with previous 
reports.9 14 We therefore consider these ACPAs as four distinct 
fi ne specifi cities, and we subsequently based our RA subsets on 
the presence or absence of anti-CEP-1, anti-Cit-vim, anti-Cit-fi b 
and anti-Cit-C1 antibodies rather than CCP status. The fact that 
the ACPAs occur together in some patients, but on their own in 
others, imply that their production may be governed by partly 
different mechanisms. It is therefore very interesting to note the 
specifi c relationship between HLA-DRB1 SE and certain ACPA 
fi ne specifi cities (particularly CEP-1 and Cit-vim) but not others 
(mainly Cit-fi b).
The estimated risks in some of the analyses should be viewed 
in the context of small sample sizes with large CI. However, our 
data collectively point to clear differences between ACPA fi ne 
specifi cities, thus confi rming and extending previous reports.11–13
Importantly, the present study answers the previously unan￾swered question concerning the infl uence of HLA-DRB1 SE on 
the specifi city versus the magnitude of the ACPA response.32
Also notable is the fact that the effects of smoking and PTPN22, 
in the context of HLA-DRB1 SE, appear to be most pronounced 
in subsets defi ned by multiple ACPAs where reactivity to CEP-1 
is present. These data may suggest that smoking is involved in 
citrullinating and exposing some—but not other—autoantigens 
to the immune system, and that PTPN22 exerts its effects only 
when certain MHC class II-dependent immune reactions are 
involved. These data will form the basis for future experimental 
studies on molecular pathways of relevance for disease develop￾ment in distinct subsets of RA.
In summary, our data highlight the complexity of the gene–
environment infl uence on ACPA-positive RA. A particularly 
interesting fi nding is that HLA-DRB1 SE together with PTPN22
and smoking associate so strongly with the presence of anti￾CEP-1 antibodies, on the one hand, and anti-Cit-vim antibod￾ies on the other, but mainly with the simultaneous presence of 
both ACPAs. Since the SE comprises several different alleles and 
since a dose-effect has been demonstrated for the HLA-DRB1 SE 
association,4 5 11 one may speculate that peptides from citrulli￾nated α-enolase may be preferentially presented by one specifi c 
SE allele and subsequently trigger the production of anti-CEP-1 
antibodies, while peptides from citrullinated vimentin are pref￾erentially presented by another SE allele giving rise to anti-Cit￾vim antibodies. Hence, in such a scenario, the presence of two 
different SE alleles would drive the simultaneous production of 
two different ACPAs which may tentatively synergise in con￾tributing to the development of RA. Detailed studies of the 
SE alleles, other MHC class II alleles, as well as other genetic 
polymorphisms and environmental exposures in the context of 
different ACPA fi ne specifi cities will increase our understanding 
of the aetiology in different subsets of ACPA-positive RA. The 
results from such studies may also help to develop future per￾sonalised therapies for patients with RA and preventive strate￾gies for individuals at risk of developing the disease.
