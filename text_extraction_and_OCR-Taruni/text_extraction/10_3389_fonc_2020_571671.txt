Aim: The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence, clinical characteristics,
prognostic factors and survival of ovarian cancer patients with liver metastases upon
initial diagnosis.
Methods: Patients with ovarian cancer liver metastases upon initial diagnosis between
2010 and 2016 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify
the predictors of the presence of liver metastases in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer
patients. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log￾rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was conducted to determine the
independent prognostic factors for OS.
Results: A total of 1,744 ovarian cancer patients with liver metastases was identified
from the SEER database, accounting for 6.7% of the entire ovarian cancer patients.
As to the unique distant organ provided by SEER, liver was the most common
metastatic site of ovarian cancer (4.65%). Age, race, laterality, histology, pathological
grade, extrahepatic sites, stage of tumor were the predictors of the presence with
liver metastases revealed by multivariable logistic regression model. Median OS for the
patients with liver metastases at initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer was 16.0 months.
Multivariate Cox regression model confirmed race, histology, extrahepatic metastatic
sites, surgery and marital status were independent prognostic factors for OS.
Conclusion: The study provided population-based estimates of the incidence and
prognosis of newly diagnosed ovary cancer patients with liver metastases, which could
be potentially used for the risk assessment and individualized treatment.

INTRODUCTION
According to the latest cancer statistics in 2019, there were about 22,530 patients newly diagnosed
with ovarian cancer and 13,980 patients died of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer accounts for 2.5% of
all cancers in women and ranks the fifth cause of cancer death among women in the United States
(1). Owing to the scarcity of early, specific symptoms and effective screening strategies, patients
with ovarian cancer were often diagnosed with synchronous distant metastases at an advanced
stage, accounting for about 70% of the whole ovarian cancer population (2). The survival of ovarian

Zhao et al. Liver Metastases of Ovarian Cancer
cancer patients was stage-dependent. The 5 year survival was 92,
75, 29%, respectively, for the localized cases, regional cases and
distant cases (1). Studies of the patterns of distant metastases
in stage IV ovarian cancer showed liver was the most common
distant metastatic organ of ovarian cancer with the proportion
of 37–57%, followed by distant lymph nodes, lung, bone and
brain (3–5). Autopsy studies of cases died of primary ovarian
cancer showed that the incidence of liver parenchyma was about
48.2–73% (5, 6). The median overall survival (OS) was 30 months
for patients with a single liver metastasis (4).
At present, data of prevalence and prognostic factors among
ovarian cancer patients with liver metastases is limited. The
therapy for ovarian cancer patients with liver metastases is
controversial. Here, we explored the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) database to analyze the characteristics,
incidence, risk factors and prognostic factors of ovarian cancer
patients with liver metastases upon initial diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
All the primary data were acquired from the SEER database,
which collected the information of patient demographics, tumor
characteristics, treatment and prognosis accounting for ∼30%
of the whole population in the United States. The datasets
of this current study are available from SEER∗
Stat Version
8.3.6 (http: https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/). Patients diagnosed
with primary and microscopically confirmed ovarian cancer as
the only primary malignancy between 1 January 2010 and 31
December 2016 were included in the study. We excluded those
patients younger than 18 years old, diagnosed with carcinoma
in situ, benign or borderline tumors, with unknown information
of liver metastases, diagnosed by autopsy or death certificate.
Finally, there were 26,197 patients eligible for incidence analysis.
Among these patients, 1,744 patients had liver metastases upon
initially diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Next, we removed patients
with unknown follow-up, as well as patients who presented with 0
day of survival record, leaving 25,819 patients and 1,718 patients
with liver metastases for the survival analysis.
Statistical Analysis
The incidence of different distant metastatic organs including
liver, bone, brain, and lung among the total patients with ovarian
cancer was calculated in this study. Incidence was defined
the number of ovarian cancer patients with corresponding
metastases divided by the whole number of patients with
ovarian cancer.
We compared the patient characteristics between patients
with liver metastases and those without liver metastases by the
Pearson chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test appropriately. Study
variables in the descriptive statistics were included as follows:
age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race, laterality, histology,
primary tumor stage, regional lymph node stage, pathological
grade, surgery, numbers of extrahepatic metastatic sites (bone,
brain, and lung), marital status and insurance status. In the SEER
database, tumor grades were classified into I (well-differentiated),
II (moderately differentiated), III (poorly differentiated), and IV
(undifferentiated or anaplastic).
Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was
conducted to determine the risk factors for the liver metastases
at initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Variables including age
at diagnosis, race, laterality, histology, pathological grade, the
extent of extrahepatic metastatic sites, primary tumor stage,
lymph node stage, marital status and insurance status were
analyzed in this model. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were reported from the logistic regression.
Overall survival (OS) was determined as the date of diagnosis
of ovarian cancer to the date of death due to any cause or
the date of last follow-up. We utilized the univariable and
multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to assess the
association of study variables with OS by reporting the hazard
ratios (HR) and 95% Cis. In our study, the marital status was
enrolled in the analysis of prognostic factors for the following
reasons. First, epidemiological studies have reported a reduced
risk of ovarian cancer among women who have had children.
And infertility has been associated with an increasing risk of
ovarian cancer (7, 8). Second, married patients with cancer may
have more support from family members, social services and
insurance than unmarried patients. Unmarried patients are at
significant higher risk of undertreatment and death from cancer
(9). Kaplan-Meier method was performed to obtain the survival
estimates and the log-rank test was conducted to analyze the
difference between subgroups.
All the statistical analyses were performed by the SPSS
statistical software version 22 (IBM Corporation, USA). All
P-values calculated were two-sided, and a p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Incidence
Total of 26,197 patients were diagnosed with ovarian cancer
from 2010, January to 2016, December reported by the SEER
database. Among the total 26,197 patients, there were 13,366
patients with serous ovarian cancer (51.0%), 2,321 patients with
endometrioid carcinoma (8.9%), 1,765 patients with clear cell
ovarian cancer (6.7%), 1,587 patients with mucinous carcinoma
(6.1%) and 7,158 patients with other types such as granular
cell cancer and Brenner tumor (27.3%). In view of the small
size, we categorized the non-serous ovarian cancer into one
group. Figure 1 illustrated the incidence of patients with distant
metastases at initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer according to
the metastatic sites including liver, bone, lung and brain among
the entire cohort. 4.65, 0.39, 4.00, 0.10% ovarian cancer patients
had liver metastases, bone metastases, lung metastases, brain
metastases only, respectively, at initial diagnosis. As to patients
with two distant metastatic sites, patients with liver and lung
metastases had the highest proportion, accounting for 1.20%
among the entire population.
Patient Characteristics
One thousand seven hundred and forty four patients had liver
metastases at initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer, accounting

for 6.7% among the total population. Table 1 showed the
demographic and clinical characteristics for ovarian cancer
patients with and without liver metastases. Compared to patients
without liver metastases at initial diagnosis, patients with liver
metastases were older (P < 0.001), were more likely to be
Black (P < 0.001), had bilateral tumors (P < 0.001), presented
with more advanced T stage (P < 0.001), presented with more
advanced N stage (P < 0.001), had a higher pathological grade
(P < 0.001), had no surgery of primary tumor (P < 0.001),
had more extrahepatic metastatic sites to lung, bone and brain
(P < 0.001), were more likely to be unmarried (P < 0.001).
The results of univariable and multivariable logistic regression
performed among the whole population was displayed in Table 2.
On the univariable logistic regression model, age 41–60 years
(vs. age 18–40 years, P < 0.001), age greater than 60 years (vs. age
18–40 years, P < 0.001), Black race (vs. White race, P < 0.001),
bilateral (vs. left, P < 0.001), pathological grade II (vs. grade I,
P < 0.001), grade III (vs. grade I, P < 0.001), grade IV (vs. grade
I, P < 0.001), 1 extrahepatic site (vs. 0 extrahepatic site, P <
0.001), 2 extrahepatic sites (vs. 0 extrahepatic site, P < 0.001),
3 extrahepatic sites (vs. 0 extrahepatic site, P < 0.001), T2 stage
(vs. T1 stage, P < 0.001), T3 stage (vs. T1 stage, P < 0.001),
N1 stage (vs. N0 stage, P < 0.001) were significantly associated
with greater odds of liver metastases at initial diagnosis of
ovarian cancer. Asian/Pacific islander (vs. White race, P = 0.007),
married status (vs. unmarried, P < 0.001) were associated
with lower odds of liver metastases at diagnosis. Histology and
insurance state were not associated with the risk of having
liver metastases at initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer. On the
multivariable logistic regression, age >60 years (vs. age 18–
40 years, P = 0.032), Black race (vs. White race, P = 0.037);
bilateral (vs. left, P < 0.001), non-serous type (vs. serous type,
P < 0.001), grade III (vs. grade I, P < 0.001), grade IV (vs. grade
I, P < 0.001), 1 extrahepatic site (vs. 0 extrahepatic site, P <
0.001), 2 extrahepatic sites (vs. 0 extrahepatic site, P < 0.001),
3 extrahepatic sites (vs. 0 extrahepatic site, P < 0.001), T2 stage
(vs. T1 stage, P < 0.001), T3 stage (vs. T1 stage, P < 0.001), N1
stage (vs. N0 stage, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with
greater odds of liver metastases at initial diagnosis of ovarian
cancer. Married status (vs. unmarried status, P = 0.016) was
associated with lower risk of liver metastases at initial diagnosis
of ovarian cancer.
Survival Analysis
One thousand seven hundred and eighteen ovarian cancer
patients with liver metastases were enrolled in the survival
analysis. There were 854 patients with serous ovarian cancer
(49.7%), 44 patients with endometrioid carcinoma (2.6%), 48
patients with clear cell ovarian cancer (2.8%), 46 patients
with mucinous carcinoma (2.7%) and 726 patients with other
types such as granular cell cancer and Brenner tumor (42.3%).
The median OS among patients with liver metastases was
16.0 months, and the interquartile range (IQR) was 3.0–50.0
months (Figure 2A). OS curves stratified by ovarian cancer
type of pathology was illustrated (Figure 2B). Patients with
serous ovarian cancer had better survival than those with
non-serous ovarian cancer (median OS: 30.0 months vs. 6.0
months, log-rank test, P < 0.001). The impact of the extent
of extrahepatic metastatic disease on the survival of patients
with liver metastases was estimated (Figure 2C, log-rank test,
P < 0.001). Patients with more numbers of extrahepatic
metastatic sites had worse prognosis.
Among the whole population, there were 1,385 patients with
extrahepatic metastatic disease. The presence of liver metastases
or not on the median survival of these patients stratified by
the extent of extrahepatic metastatic sites was concluded in
Table 3. Broadly speaking, patients with no baseline of liver
metastases had better survival than patients with liver metastases.
Specifically, significant difference was shown in patients with
bone and liver metastases (median OS, 6.0 months; IQR, 1.0–
10.0 months) vs. those with bone metastases only (median
OS, 10.0 months; IQR, 3.0–44.0 months) (log-rank test, P =
0.003), patients with lung and liver metastases (median OS, 13.0
months; IQR, 2.0–33.0 months) vs. those with lung metastases
only (median OS, 21.0 months; IQR, 6.0–41.0 months) (log￾rank test, P = 0.001), patients with brain and liver metastases
(median OS, 1.0 months; IQR, 1.0–1.0 months) vs. those with
brain metastases only (median OS, 7.0 months; IQR, 2.0-NR)
(log-rank test, P = 0.016).
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models
were performed to evaluate the prognostic factors of ovarian
cancer patients with liver metastases (Table 4). In the univariate
Cox models, Black race (vs. White race, HR,1.500; 95% CI, 1.261–
1.784; P < 0.001); American India/Alaskan (vs. White race, HR,
1.776; 95% CI, 1.027–3.071; P = 0.04), non-serous type(vs. serous
type, HR, 2.493; 95% CI, 2.206–2.819; P < 0.001), 1 extrahepatic
site (vs. 0 extrahepatic site, HR, 1.458; 95% CI, 1.262–1.683; P
< 0.001), 2 extrahepatic sites (vs. 0 extrahepatic site, HR, 2.687;
95% CI, 1.988–3.632; P < 0.001) were significantly associated

DISCUSSION
The dissemination types of ovarian cancer were divided into the
transcoelomic metastasis, hematogenous and lymphatic spread
metastasis, which individually had distinct molecular metastases
mechanisms (10). Some research focused on the mechanisms of
distant metastases including liver metastases in ovarian cancer.
Kim et al. found the reduction of chemokine receptor the
lymphotactin receptor (XRC1) suppressed the colon, spleen
and liver metastases of SKOV3-xenograft mouse model (11).
A study from Li et al. revealed that high level of insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF1) was associated with advanced clinical
stage and liver metastases of ovarian cancer patients by analyzing
the expression of IGF1 in epithelial ovarian cancer clinical
specimens. Further basic research manifested the IGF1 promoted
the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells and
inhibition of IGF1 receptor and the downstream molecules
effectively suppressed the malignant phenotype of tumor cells.
Therefore, targeting the IGF1 pathway may be promising for
the treatment for ovarian cancer patients with liver metastases
(12). Joelle et al. found that the cell surface glycoprotein CD44
contributed to the spheroid formation, mesothelial adhesion
and mesenteric metastasis in epithelial ovarian carcinoma.
However, decrease of CD44 expression promoted the peritoneal
metastases like liver and the thoracic cavity (13). Wang et al.
found the overexpression of miR-203 attenuated the TGFβ
pathway and inhibited the epithelial to mesenchymal transition.
And necropsy of the orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model
showed the miR-203 suppressed primary tumor growth and
peritoneal metastases including liver and spleen (14). A study
from Yang et al. focused on the role of SMAD4 in ovarian
cancer development and invasion. Research results showed that
knocking out of SMAD4 impaired the vessel endothelial cell
tubule formation. Although nude mice experiment indicated
the loss of SMAD4 did not influence the tumor growth, it
inhibited the barrier integrity in endothelial cell and promoted
the ovarian cancer liver metastases (15). Ponnusamy et al. found
MUC4 mucin promoted the process of epithelial to mesenchymal
transition, and overexpression of MUC4 induced significantly
larger tumors and was associated with a higher incidence of
metastasis to distant sites including colon, liver and diaphragm
(16). Yu et al. found the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors
including LPA1, LPA2, LPA3 were involved the process of
tumor proliferation and invasion by regulating VEGF and the
cytokines including IL-6 and IL-8. And the overexpression of
LPA receptors was associated with distant metastases including
liver, kidney and pancreas by necropsy of the SKOV3 xenografts
tumors (17).
In our study, the incidence of patients with liver metastases
upon initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer was 4.65%. A study
from Dauplat et al. showed the incidence of parenchymal liver

by the difference of study population. Our study showed that
old age, Black race, bilateral tumors, non-serous type, high
grade, extrahepatic metastases, advanced stage and lymph nodes
involvement were risk factors associated with the presence
of liver metastases upon initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
Previous study found that advanced stage, high grade and
lymph node involvement were significant risk factors associated
with distant metastases (19). The single-institution study of 244
serous ovarian cancer patients manifested that the increasing
age, high grade tumor and advanced stage were risk factors
associated with the presence of liver metastases (20). Loizzi
et al. analyzed the clinical characteristics and survival of 29
ovarian cancer patients with hepatic metastases. Results indicated
that 76% patients presented with papillary serous histology and
62% patients presented with poorly differentiated tumors (21).
However, No significant difference was seen when compared
the distant metastatic patterns for different histologic variants of
ovarian cancer in the study from Rose et al. (22).
In our study, the median OS of patients with ovarian cancer
was 16 months (IQR, 3–50 months). The subgroup analysis
indicated that the patients with non-serous ovarian cancer and
more numbers of extrahepatic sites had worse outcome. The
multivariate Cox model showed the Black race, non-serous
type and extrahepatic metastatic sites were correlated with
increased risks of all- cause mortality, which was basically in
accordance with previous studies (4, 21, 23). A study from
Loizzi et al. revealed the OS among ovarian cancer patients with
liver metastases upon initial diagnosis, with liver metastases as
first recurrence, with liver metastases as second relapse was 19
months (IOR: 6–23 months), 24 months (IQR: 3–44 months),
10.0 months (IQR: 1–33 months), respectively, and no significant
difference was seen among the three subgroups. The patients with
liver metastases only had better survival than those with other
metastatic sites (median OS: 25 months vs. 8 months, IQR: 9–44
months vs. 1–20 months, P = 0.033). And patients with serous
ovarian cancer had better survival than those with other type of
ovarian cancer (median OS: 23 vs. 8 months, IQR: 1–44 vs. 1–15
months, P = 0.005, HR, 2.875, 95% CI, 2.51–3.23) (21).
The treatment for ovarian cancer patients with liver
metastases was still uncertain. Our study showed the surgery of
primary site reduced the risk of all-cause death (HR, 0.255; 95%

CI, 0.225–0.289; P < 0.001). A study enrolled in 105 patients
with stage IV ovarian cancer from Curtin et al. showed surgery
was an important determinant prognosis (24). Gallotta et al.
retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcome of laparoscopic
secondary cytoreduction for 29 patients with localized recurrent
ovarian cancer. The rate of complete debulking was 96.2% and
the median DFS was 14.0 months (25). A study of analyzing
the safety of laparoscopic secondary cytoreductive surgery in
58 patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer
showed that the median PFS was 28.0 months and the 2 year
OS was 90.7% (26). Wang et al. found that the OS of ovarian
cancer patients with liver metastases who received R0 liver
resection and cytoreductive surgery were 50.1 months, however,
the OS of patients who received R0 cytoreductive surgery and
non-R0 liver resection was 20.0 months (27). Some selected
patients with cytoreductive surgery and liver resection had better
outcome. A complete cytoreduction to no residual disease, good
performance status, negative resection margins, less numbers of
liver lesions and long progression-free interval were significant
factors correlated with favorable outcome of ovarian cancer
patients with liver metastases. However, it is worth noting
that liver resection may cause some relevant complications
Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 8 September 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 571671

Zhao et al. Liver Metastases of Ovarian Cancer
like bilioma, abnormality of liver function, diaphragmatic
injury, chest complications, and bile leakage (28). Transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) had some role in the treatment of
ovarian cancer patients with liver metastases. The survival rates
after receiving TACE was 58% after 1 year, 19% after 2 years,
and 13% after 3 years (29). A study of 109 patients with stage IV
ovarian cancer from Giovanni et al. found patients with multiple
unresectable liver metastases had worse survival than those with
resectable liver involvement (median OS, 14 months vs. NR,
P = 0.003) (30). In a retrospective study of 37 patients with stage
IV epithelial ovarian cancer with liver metastases, Naik et al.
found that optimal cytoreduction is an independent prognostic
factors associated with more favorable outcome (31). Zhuo et al.
analyzed the survival difference of 29 ovarian cancer patients with
liver metastases receiving microwave ablation (MWA) or surgical
resection (SR). And no significant difference was seen between
the two groups (5 year OS rate: SR vs. MWA, 64.3% vs. 51.3%,
P = 0.198) (32).
Ailbhe et al. compared the clinical characteristics and survival
between ovarian cancer patients with liver parenchymal invasion
(LPI) from peritoneal metastases and those with hematogenous
liver metastases (HLM). Results showed increasing age and
suboptimal cytoreduction were factors associated with LPI while
increasing age, high grade tumor and advanced stage were risk
factors correlated with HLM. Survival analysis showed that
ovarian cancer patients with LPI had similar survival to those
without LPI (median OS: 80 vs. 123 months, IQR: 50-NR vs.
49–279 months, P = 0.6) while ovarian cancer patients with HLM
had worse survival than those without HLM (median OS: 63
vs. 145 months, IQR: 43–139 months vs. 50-NR, P = 0.006).
Therefore, it may be important to elucidate the clear criteria
and identify the metastases type among ovarian cancer patients
with liver metastases for individual clinical management (20).
A study from Charlie et al. compared the frequency of visceral
metastases between BRCA1/2 deficient ovarian cancer patients
and BRCA1/2 proficient ovarian cancer patients, BRCA1/2
deficient ovarian cancer had increased incidence of visceral
metastases (BRCA1/2 deficient vs. BRCA1/2 proficient, 58%
vs. 5%, P < 0.001) and liver metastases (BRCA1/2 deficient
vs. BRCA1/2 proficient, 42% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). BRCA1/2
sequencing should be considered among the ovarian cancer
patients for better clinical management (33). Gallotta et al.
analyzed the survival of 34 recurrent ovarian cancer patients with
liver metastases who underwent liver resection within secondary
cytoreductive surgery. Results indicated that patients with BRCA
mutation had better survival than those with BRCA wild type
(3 year post-liver resection progression free survival: 81.0% vs.
15.2%, P = 0.001). The assessment of BRCA mutational status
may be important for risk stratification among the ovarian cancer
patients with liver metastases (34). Sood et al. evaluated the
status of p53 mutation in 130 ovarian cancer patients. Results
revealed patients with a null mutation had a higher incidence of
distant metastases than those with missense mutations or wild
type p53 (66% vs. 8% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). Twenty five percentage
patients with null p53 mutation presented with distant metastases
including liver, spleen, brain, and thorax at initial diagnosis of
ovarian cancer. It may be important to evaluate the p53 status for
clinicians when dealing with the ovarian cancer patients (35).
To our knowledge, this current study was the largest
study about ovarian cancer patients with liver metastases.
However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the
information provided by SEER database is insufficient, including
the other metastatic sites such as peritoneal metastases of
ovarian cancer, the detailed data about size and number of liver
metastases and the information of individual treatment. Second,
the study population are mainly in the ovarian cancer patients
with liver metastases upon initial diagnosis excluding those
developed with liver metastases during the recurrence. Third,
the SEER database is based on the register in the United States.
The study results may cause deviations in the other parts of the
whole world.
In conclusion, this present study provided valuable
information including incidence, risk factors and prognostic
factors for newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients with
liver metastases. These findings assist clinicians make clinical
management decisions of prognostic assessment and risk
stratification. In the future, basic research and large sample
prospective clinical trials are warranted to further evaluate
the molecular characteristics and treatment for ovarian cancer
patients with liver metastases.
