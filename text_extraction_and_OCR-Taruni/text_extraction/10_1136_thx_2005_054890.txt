Abstract
Background: Lung densitometry derived from computed
tomographic images offers an opportunity to quantify emphysema
non-invasively, but a pathological standard cannot be applied to
validate its use in longitudinal monitoring studies. Consequently,
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) remains the standard
against which new methods must be judged. We related progression
of densitometry (15th percentile point and voxel index, threshold
−950 Hounsfield units) to disease stage and FEV1 decline in two
studies of subjects with α1-antitrypsin deficiency (PiZ).
Methods: Consistency of progression, measured using densitometry
and FEV1, was assessed in relation to disease stage in a 2 year study
of 74 subjects grouped according to the FEV1 criteria employed in
the GOLD guidelines. In the second study of a subgroup of subjects
with extended data (n = 34), summary statistics were applied to
measurements performed annually over 3 years and the rate of
progression of densitometry was related to FEV1 decline.
Results: The progression of percentile point was consistent across a
wide spectrum of disease severity, but voxel index progression
varied in association with disease stage (p = 0.004). In the second
study, FEV1 decline correlated with progression of lung
densitometry (percentile point: rS = 0.527, p = 0.001; voxel index:
rS = −0.398, p = 0.012).
Conclusions: 15th percentile point is a more consistent measure of
lung density loss across a wide range of physiological impairment


than voxel index. However, both methods are valid for use in
longitudinal and interventional studies in which emphysema is the
major outcome target.
