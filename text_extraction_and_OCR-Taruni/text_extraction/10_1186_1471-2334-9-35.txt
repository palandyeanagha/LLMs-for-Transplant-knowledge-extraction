Abstract
Background: In Uzbekistan, routine serologic testing has not been available to differentiate
etiologies of acute viral hepatitis (AVH). To determine the age groups most affected by hepatitis E
virus (HEV) during documented AVH epidemics, trends in AVH-associated mortality rate (MR) per
100,000 over a 15-year period and reported incidence of AVH over a 35-year period were
examined.
Methods: Reported AVH incidence data from 1971 to 2005 and AVH-associated mortality data
from 1981 to 1995 were examined. Serologic markers for infection with hepatitis viruses A, B, D,
and E were determined from a sample of hospitalized patients with AVH from an epidemic period
(1987) and from a sample of pregnant women with AVH from a non-epidemic period (1992).
Results: Two multi-year AVH outbreaks were identified: one during 1975–1976, and one during
1985–1987. During 1985–1987, AVH-associated MRs were 12.3–17.8 per 100,000 for the general
population. Highest AVH-associated MRs occurred among children in the first 3 years of life (40–
190 per 100,000) and among women aged 20–29 (15–21 per 100,000). During 1988–1995 when
reported AVH morbidity was much lower in the general population, AVH-associated MRs were
markedly lower among these same age groups. In 1988, AVH-associated MRs were higher in rural
(21 per 100,000) than in urban (8 per 100,000) populations (RR 2.6; 95% CI 1.16–5.93; p < 0.05).
Serologic evidence of acute HEV infection was found in 280 of 396 (71%) patients with AVH in 1987
and 12 of 99 (12%) pregnant patients with AVH in 1992.
Conclusion: In the absence of the availability of confirmatory testing, inferences regarding
probable hepatitis epidemic etiologies can sometimes be made using surveillance data, comparing

AVH incidence with AVH-associated mortality with an eye to population-based viral hepatitis
control measures. Data presented here implicate HEV as the probable etiology of high mortality
observed in pregnant women and in children less than 3 years of age in Uzbekistan during 1985–
1987. High mortality among pregnant women but not among children less than 3 years has been
observed in previous descriptions of epidemic hepatitis E. The high mortality among younger
children observed in an AVH outbreak associated with hepatitis E merits corroboration in future
outbreaks.
Background
In Uzbekistan, there is a high incidence of infection with
hepatitis viruses including the viruses of hepatitis A
(HAV) [1], hepatitis B (HBV) [2], hepatitis C (HCV) [3],
hepatitis D (HDV) [4], and hepatitis E (HEV) [5]. In
1990–1995, of all reportable infectious processes, the
number of reported cases of acute viral hepatitis (AVH)
was exceeded only by the cumulative number of cases of
acute respiratory disease [6]. AVH is a reportable disease
in Uzbekistan, where periodic epidemics of fecal-orally￾transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis have been described
[7,8]. Elsewhere, in regions in which epidemics of hepati￾tis E have been observed, increases in mortality among
pregnant women have been reported [9-12].
For reporting purposes in Uzbekistan and other Central
Asian republics of the former Soviet Union, the diagnosis
of hepatitis A has generally been based on signs, symp￾toms and epidemiological data, while the diagnosis of
acute hepatitis B has been based on serologic detection of
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). However, lack of
serological testing to differentiate hepatitis types has
resulted in official statistics that have generally enumer￾ated cases of AVH with typing of hepatitis A and hepatitis
B only, and reporting of HCV, HDV, and HEV infections
has not been routine.
An indicator of the impact of hepatitis infections is their
associated mortality, most often the result of chronic liver
disease [13]. However, few data exist concerning age- and
gender-specific associations of AVH with mortality. We
analyzed trends in AVH-associated mortality, including
during periods in which hepatitis E epidemics have been
documented [14,15], to determine age- and gender-spe￾cific changes in mortality.
Methods
Incidence Reporting
AVH incidence (morbidity) data from 1971 through 2005
were obtained from reports of the Sanitary-Epidemiologic
Service (SES) of the Uzbekistan Ministry of Health
(MOH). These are standardized data from a surveillance
system that was uniformly used by the republics during
the Soviet era [16,17] and that has continued to function
in Uzbekistan since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Uzbekistan is organized into 12 provinces, called viloyats,
and one autonomous republic; each of these is subdivided
into administrative units called raions. At each level
(republic, viloyat, raion), the SES has operated an infec￾tious disease surveillance system in which AVH has been
a reportable condition. The system has evolved under a
mandate that requires all suspected or confirmed cases to
be reported by telephone to the raion SES within 12
hours, followed by a written case report [17,18]. These
reports are forwarded to the viloyat SES. Reporting sources
include physicians and feldshers (primary health care pro￾viders with less formal training than physicians, found
more commonly in rural areas) who evaluate patients in
hospitals, polyclinics, diagnostic centers, ambulatory clin￾ics, or feldsher stations (rural primary health care clinics).
For each case, health care providers report patient's name,
age, date of birth, sex, address, occupation, day care
attendance, last day of work, polyclinic attended, primary
diagnosis, date of symptom onset, date of physician visit,
date of diagnosis, and date of hospitalization.
Telephone case reports received at the raion SES are
recorded and updated as additional clinical, laboratory
and epidemiologic information is received to help raion
SES staff implement disease control measures. The raion
SES obtains additional information on each case within
24 hours using a standardized case investigation form.
Raion SES staff complete a separate case form which sum￾marizes the information collected during the course of the
epidemiologic and clinical work-up, including clinical
presentation, vaccination status, and laboratory results.
SES epidemiologists may request additional laboratory
testing to confirm the healthcare provider's clinical diag￾nosis. However, lack of reagents to perform diagnostic
testing and lack of strict case definitions have had the
result that most reported cases of AVH in the SES database
reflect clinical diagnoses that have not been laboratory
confirmed.
Raions report AVH case totals to the viloyat SES, and raion
cases are tabulated by age group (total, 0 to 14 years; <1
year (infancy); 1 and 2 years (up to but not including the
third birthday); and 3 to 6 years). Annually, aggregated
data are reported to the viloyat SES. Each month, the vilo-

yat SES tabulates confirmed AVH cases by age group, and
reports totals to the republican SES.
Mortality Reporting
AVH-specific mortality data were examined as provided to
the MOH by Goskomstat, the State Committee of Statistics
of the Republic of Uzbekistan, a governmental vital
records agency with its own raion-viloyat-republic report￾ing hierarchy that is separate from the SES. When a patient
dies, the clinician notifies the hospital or polyclinic statis￾tician, who in turn is responsible for reporting the death
and its putative cause(s) to the statistical administrative
units within Goskomstat that are concerned with mortality.
Case Definition
Although there has been no strict case definition of AVH,
MOH guidelines for clinicians have traditionally defined
AVH as an infectious disease characterized by acute onset
of jaundice, hepatomegaly, and (where available) a three￾fold or greater elevation of serum aminotransferase levels.
AVH is noted as a cause of death on a death certificate if a
clinician believes the death was a complication of AVH.
Laboratory Methods
During an identified AVH outbreak in 1987, serum sam￾ples were collected from a convenience sample of hospi￾talized patients with AVH in Eastern and Southern
Uzbekistan (Fergana and Kashkadarya viloyats) on the
first to seventh day after onset of jaundice; criterion for
hospitalization was onset of jaundice. Similarly, during
1992, serum samples were collected from a convenience
sample of hospitalized pregnant women with AVH in
Tashkent viloyat on the first to seventh day after onset of
jaundice; again, criterion for hospitalization was onset of
jaundice. For both groups, case-patients were defined as
those with acute onset of dyspepsia, jaundice, hepatome￾galy, and a three-fold or greater increase in serum concen￾trations of alanine aminotrasferase. Serum specimens
were delinked from personal identifiers at the time of col￾lection and were stored at -20°C until subsequently
tested. As both of these activities predated implementa￾tion of codified institutional accountability of human
research protections, no standardized consenting process
was employed; however, patient participation was limited
to a solitary phlebotomy for minimal serum samples for
diagnostic purposes.
Serologic testing by enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Labo￾ratories, North Chicago, IL) for markers of infection with
hepatitis viruses was performed at the Viral Hepatitis
Diagnostic Department, Ivanovski Institute of Virology,
Moscow. Testing included assays for markers of acute
HAV infection (IgM anti-HAV); markers of acute HBV
infection, HBsAg and IgM antibody to hepatitis B core
antigen (IgM anti-HBc); and markers of acute HDV infec￾tion (IgM anti-HDV and total anti-HDV). Serum speci￾mens which tested negative for all of the above markers
were retained and subsequently tested in the Hepatitis
Reference Laboratory, Division of Viral Hepatitis,
National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Dis￾ease Control and Prevention (CDC), for IgM and IgG anti￾body to HEV (IgM and IgG anti-HEV) using both Western
blot and ELISA [19].
Statistical Methods
Incidence data analyses
To quantify AVH case counts and rates per 100,000 popu￾lation, we analyzed Republican SES reports for the period
1971–2005 and specific viloyat reports for 1985–1995.
To verify reported rates by viloyat, population counts
from viloyat reports were compared with official
Uzbekistan census data.
Mortality data analyses
To ascertain mortality rates per 100,000 (MRs) from AVH,
AVH-associated mortality data for 1981–1995 were
obtained from the Department of Statistics of the Ministry
of Health. AVH-associated MRs for the republic and for
each viloyat for 1985–1995 were calculated by age and sex
on the basis of mortality data analyzed from Goskomstat
reports. Where mortality rates per 100,000 population
were calculated for a specific age and sex group, denomi￾nator data were restricted to population estimates for that
specific age and sex group. These analyses did not include
deaths attributed to chronic viral hepatitis and/or cirrho￾sis.
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using Epi Info 6.04 for relative risk
(RR), Student's t-test, correlation analysis (r), Pearson's
conformity test, or Fisher's exact test. Specifically, categor￾ical data were analyzed using Pearson's χ2-test or Fisher's
exact test, as appropriate; Fisher's exact test was used
where categorical data were compared in which any cell
size was <5. Continuous data were analyzed with Stu￾dent's t-test. Statistical significance was determined by cal￾culating a p value (with Yates' correction factor where
needed) and exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs), or Tay￾lor series 95% CIs, as appropriate. The significance level
for all statistical analyses was p = 0.05.
Trends in AVH-associated mortality over the 15 years
(1981–1995) for which aggregate data were available
were compared with trends in reported AVH incidence
over the same period using the Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficient. For the 11-year period (1985–
1995) for which gender- and age-specific AVH-associated
mortality data were available, data were compared by gen￾der, age, and rural/urban designation of the decedent
using Pearson's χ2-test, Fisher's exact test, or Student's t-

test as appropriate, depending on whether data were cate￾gorical or continuous.
In performing analyses of serology data, IgG anti-HEV
data for various age groups of children were compared
using Pearson's χ2-test.
Results
Reported Incidence
From 1971 through 2005, national reported AVH inci￾dence in Uzbekistan was consistently greater than 200
cases per 100,000 (Fig. 1). Two multi-year epidemics of
AVH were noted: one spanning the years 1975 and 1976
with annual incidences of 1047 and 1072 cases per
100,000, respectively, and another from 1985 through
1987 with annual incidences of 1259, 1187, and 1431
cases per 100,000. Single-year increases in AVH were also
noted in 1973, 1983, 1995 and 1997, with peak inci￾dences ranging from 600 to 1051 per 100,000.
Verification of reported population counts by viloyat
revealed no discrepancies when viloyat reports for hepati￾tis rates were compared with official Uzbekistan census
data. The geographic distribution of average annual AVH
incidence varied: highest viloyat rates were reported in the
East (Fergana, Namangan, and Andijan) and in the South
(Kashkadarya, Surkhandarya), where incidence in some
viloyats was 1.5- to 1.8-times the national average. In less
densely populated areas, e.g., in the West (Karaka￾lpakstan, Bukhara, and Navoi), incidence tended to be

lower than the national average except in 1985–1987.
Despite higher population density, reported AVH inci￾dence in Tashkent was relatively low and exceeded the
national rate only in 1995 and 1997.
Reported Mortality
AVH-associated mortality varied over 1981 to 1995 and
AVH-associated mortality was closely associated with
reported AVH incidence, r = 0.92; p < 0.001 (Fig. 1). The
highest nationwide AVH-associated mortality occurred in
1987 (17.8 per 100,000) with a corresponding AVH inci￾dence rate of 1,431 per 100,000.
In 1985–1995, no significant difference was observed
between males and females: among males, the MR was
11.8 (95%CI: 10.3–13.3) per 100,000, and among
females, the MR was 10.8 (95%CI: 9.3–12.3) (RR = 1.0;
95%CI: 0.8–1.4; p = not significant (n.s.)). When AVH￾associated mortality was examined by age group for all
ages, highest rates were observed in children aged <3 years
(Fig. 2), especially among those aged <2 years; among
both those aged <1 year and those aged ≥1 to <2 years, the
peak coincided with the 1987 peak observed in reported
AVH incidence. In Fig 2, gender-specific AVH-associated
mortality for 1985–1995 by age group (<1 year, ≥1 to <2
years, ≥2 to <3 years, 3 to 14 years) is presented in a set of
four bar diagrams. Because reported AVH incidence data
were not available in the same age classifications as AVH￾associated mortality, AVH incidence rate for all age groups
combined is presented as a line diagram above each of the
four bar diagrams to give the reader an appreciation of the
temporal distribution of the AVH-associated age-specific
mortality relative to the overall reported AVH morbidity.
From 1987 to 1995, the AVH-associated MR decreased
among infants (children aged <1 year) from 143.7 to 29.3
per 100,000 (p < 0.01), and among children aged ≥1 to <2
years from 166.8 to 30.6 per 100,000 (p < 0.01); markedly

tality were observed among children aged ≥2 to <3 years
and among those 3 to 14 years during this same period,
reflecting at least in part the fact that older children had a
much smaller risk of AVH-associated mortality at the
height of the epidemic than did children aged <2 years.
From 1985 to 1995, significant gender differences in
AVH-associated mortality among children were observed.
Of 22,405 AVH-associated deaths, 11,793 deaths were
among males, of whom 10,024 (85%) were aged 0–14
years; 10,612 deaths were among females, of whom 7121
(67.1%) were aged 0–14 years (RR [of death among males
vs. females] = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.25–1.29, p < 0.001).
From 1985 to 1995, AVH-associated MRs ranged from 1.1
to 5.6 per 100,000 among males in different 5-year age
groups aged 15 to 49 years, and from 2.6 to 7.8 per
100,000 among males aged >50 [see Additional file 1].
Marked AVH-associated mortality was noted among
females aged 20–24 years and 25–29 years, with the high￾est rates in these age groups in 1986 (21.4 and 19.6 per
100,000, respectively) and 1987 (19.0 and 18.5 per
100,000, respectively).
During 1985–1987, AVH-associated MRs were 12.3–17.8
per 100,000 for the general population. In 1985–1989,
AVH-associated MRs were consistently higher among
females than among males in several age groups: 15–19
years; 20–24 years; 25–29 years; and 30–34-years [see
Additional file 1]. In this same time period, among per￾sons aged >40 years, females consistently had lower AVH￾associated MRs than did males (1.8–3.5 vs. 2.7–6.9 per
100,000; p < 0.01). In 1986, among persons aged 20–24
years, AVH-associated mortality among females was more
than 7 times that of males (21.4 vs. 2.9 per 100,000; p <
0.001) [see Additional file 1]. Among persons aged 15–19
years in 1993, there was an abrupt increase in AVH-asso￾ciated mortality among females (11.7 per 100,000
females vs. 3.5 per 100,000 males) despite a decrease in
the AVH incidence rate in the general population [see
Additional file 1]. This dramatic rise in mortality was not
observed in any other age group.
The geographic distribution of AVH-associated mortality
varied: highest viloyat MRs were reported in 1987 in the
Eastern viloyats (Fergana, Namangan, and Andijan: range
20.1 to 31.0 per 100,000) and in the South (Kashkadarya,
and Surkhandarya: range 23.0 to 25.0 per 100,000). From
1985 through 1995, AVH-associated MRs were higher in
rural rather than in urban populations, with decreasing
trends in both populations: 21.0/8.0 (RR= 2.6; 95% CI:
1.16–5.93, p < 0.05) per 100,000 rural/urban population
in 1988; 18.0/6.5 (RR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.07–6.16, p < 0.05)
in 1989; 12.4/4.8 (RR = 2.4; 95% CI: 0.85–6.81, p = n.s.)
in 1990; 9.3/7.0 (RR = 1.3; 95% CI: 0.48–3.45, p = n.s.) in
1991; 8.4/3.8 (RR = 2; 95% CI: 0.6–6.64, p = n.s.) in 1992
and 3.4/3.2 (RR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.2–4.95, p = n.s.) in 1993.
HEV Serology
Of 396 adults and children with AVH for whom serum
samples were available from the 1987 epidemic in south￾ern and eastern Uzbekistan (Kashkadarya and Fergana
viloyats), 280 (70.7%) were IgG anti-HEV positive; of
these, 221 (78.9%) were also IgM anti-HEV positive.
Among children with AVH, IgG anti-HEV was detected in
18/58 (31.0%) of those aged <3 years, 22/32 (68.7%) of
those aged 3–6 years, 21/37 (56.7%) of those aged 7–10
years, and 20/35 (57.1%) of those aged 11–14 years (p =
n.s.). The highest anti-HEV IgG prevalence was found
among those aged 20–29 years (104/122; 85.2%); and
30–39 years (52/63; 82.5%). Evidence of acute HAV infec￾tion (i.e., IgM anti-HAV) was found in 78 of the 396
(19.7%) and acute HBV infection (i.e., IgM anti-HBc) in
33 of the 396 (8.3%); acute HDV infection (i.e., anti-HDV
IgM and anti-HDV) in 3 (0.8%), and acute mixed infec￾tion with HAV and HBV in 2 (0.5%); none of these was
IgM anti-HEV positive.
Of 99 pregnant women with AVH for whom serum sam￾ples were available from 1992 from Tashkent viloyat, 12
(12%) tested positive for IgM and IgG anti-HEV, with one
AVH-associated death (8%; 95% CI 4–40); 55 (55%) had
evidence of acute HBV infection, with one AVH-associated
death (2%; 95% CI 0.1–10); 16 had acute HDV superin￾fection, and two of these had AVH-associated deaths
(12.5%; 95% CI 2–40).
Discussion
This study documented sustained high AVH incidence
over a 35-year period in Uzbekistan and two large AVH
epidemics, the latter of which was associated with docu￾mented acute HEV infection in serum specimens gathered
from AVH cases hospitalized during the epidemic. During
both of these epidemics, a dramatic increase in AVH-asso￾ciated mortality was observed among females 15–39 years
of age, and in the first of these epidemics, among children
<3 years of age. Among children, reported AVH-associated
mortality was significantly higher among boys than
among girls. Reported AVH incidence and AVH-associated
mortality during these epidemics were 2–3 times higher in
rural areas than in urban areas. As these epidemics waned,
the mortality rate for women of childbearing age
decreased dramatically. Similar hepatitis E epidemics
have also been documented in adjacent, less-densely pop￾ulated republics, – in 1983–1984 in Turkmenistan imme￾diately to the West [5], and in 1986–1987 in Tajikistan
and Kyrgyzstan immediately to the East [20].
In 1993, the rise in AVH-associated mortality in
Uzbekistan among women was relatively limited to those

aged 15-19 years; from the serologic data that we have pre￾sented and from the fact that the mortality was confined
to women of childbearing age, we posit that these data
reflected a hepatitis E outbreak relatively limited to per￾sons under 20 years of age. In this case, the distribution of
ages affected may have reflected a cohort effect of HEV
immunity among older women of childbearing age who
were exposed in the 1985–1987 epidemics. In the more
recent years of this analysis, there was a marked decrease
in mortality among women aged 20–29 years associated
with the overall decrease in AVH incidence and mortality.
During 1991-1995, when AVH was not epidemic across
the whole population, the AVH-associated MR among
women aged 20-24 and 25-29 years ranged from 2.6 to
7.3 per 100,000 women. Based on these data, it appears
that HEV infection was a large contributor to the AVH￾associated deaths during this period, most likely among
young pregnant women. In the absence of laboratory con￾firmation, AVH-associated mortality among reproductive
age women may be of use as an indicator of HEV infec￾tion.
Although the patterns of mortality observed among
women of childbearing age were consistent with observa￾tions from previous descriptions of hepatitis E epidemics
[5,7,9-11], we have not identified previous population￾based reports of increased mortality among young chil￾dren in association with HEV infection. However, from
these and other endemic areas, it has been reported that
younger children are more likely to have more severe dis￾ease than do persons in other age groups if infected with
HEV [21-27]. Although infant MRs before the epidemic
period that began in 1985 had been similar to those
found elsewhere on average in the former Soviet Union,
AVH-associated mortality in children under the age of 2
years in Uzbekistan was five times that observed on aver￾age across the former Soviet Union during this epidemic
period [13].
In reviewing the morbidity and mortality data presented
here, other causes of AVH were considered. The dramatic
increase in AVH-associated mortality in the youngest age
groups during the HEV epidemic period could not be
ascribed solely to either of the other two most common
causes of acute liver failure in the pediatric population in
this region, namely HAV infection or HBV infection. HAV
infection in young children in a highly endemic area is
almost always asymptomatic and rarely results in death
[8,13,28-30]. As for acute HBV infection, over the period
1985–1995, there was little fluctuation in documented
disease incidence in the youngest age groups in
Uzbekistan [6]. However, it is possible that the increase in
AVH-associated mortality observed in the youngest age
groups at least in part reflected HEV infection accompa￾nied by another wide-spread cause of acute liver failure,
e.g., HAV or HBV co-infection, drug-induced liver failure,
or an environmental toxin. Indeed, it has been observed
that children with HAV and HEV co-infection have a
higher incidence of acute liver failure than do children
who do not have co-infection [31]. Both hepatotoxic
mycotoxin contamination of grain-based foodstuffs [32]
and hepatoxic pyrrolizidine-alkaloid ingestion as the
result of Heliotropium lasocarpium contamination in wheat
production [33-35] are well-described phenomena in the
region; and at least one case of hepatitis associated with
IgM anti-HEV antibodies has been described in a child,
developing after starting dapsone and resolving after dis￾continuing the medication, suggesting drug-induced
potentiation of hepatitis E [36]. However, no known AVH
etiology other than HEV was widely observed or suspected
among children in this region during 1985 through 1987.
Although the high mortality rate observed in this out￾break among children under the age of 3 years, especially
those under the age of 2 years, suggests that this group
may be at greater risk for developing more severe forms of
AVH in a epidemic of hepatitis E, mortality case-specific
serology data were not available to determine whether any
other cause of acute liver failure may have contributed to
the increase in mortality.
In 1985 to 1987, when AVH mortality was greatest, there
was a mortality increase among those aged between 1 and
3 years that was much greater than that among infants
(children less than 1 year of age). Understandably, those
aged between 1 and 3 years generally would have a greater
exposure than infants because of the increased likelihood
of using water sources rather than continuing breast-feed￾ing and because of greater mobility and access of the child
to sources of HEV exposure. Infections from contami￾nated food and water begin after breastfed babies are
weaned [37].
Protective factors in breast milk and maternal antibodies
could also explain why infants fared better than children
aged between 1 and 3 years in an environment with HEV
exposure: IgG antibodies cross the placenta well during
the third trimester [38], and secretory IgA antibodies and
other host defense factors in breast milk, such as lactofer￾rin, lysozyme, and macrophages and granulocytes, can be
protective or mitigate infection [37,39]. Milk-excreted
antibodies play a role in protecting infants from infection
by pathogens having a mucosal portal of entry, such as
rotavirus [40,41]. However, in the 1985–1987 outbreak
described here, only 8–10% of all healthy women had
anti-HEV IgG in serum (data not shown), so one would
expect that only 8–10% of infants would have had mater￾nal antibody protection from HEV infection. In evaluating
future outbreaks, if only a small fraction of infants has
antibodies to HEV and if increases in hepatitis E-associ￾ated mortality observed among children between 1 and 3

years of age are greater than those observed among
infants, alternative hypotheses will need to be considered
to explain this latter phenomenon.
Conclusion
Because morbidity and mortality from AVH are the result
of social, economic and environmental factors, the effec￾tiveness of population-based viral hepatitis control meas￾ures depends on targeted, etiology-focused efforts
including implementation of virus-specific surveillance.
In the case of hepatitis E, the goal of such efforts is to
improve hygiene and to assist in determining potential
target populations for a highly efficacious, recombinant
vaccine that has been developed and tested but is not yet
available [42,43]. In Uzbekistan, surveillance based exclu￾sively on clinical and epidemiologic data has been inade￾quate; the only test routinely available for viral hepatitis
has been identification of HBsAg, with no other test read￾ily available to differentiate viral hepatitis types. Because
studies of AVH mortality in the former Soviet Union have
lacked accurate etiology-specific data [13], morbidity sta￾tistics for specific viral hepatitis diagnoses have been unre￾liable. However, our findings suggest that when AVH
incidence is compared with AVH-associated mortality, it
may be logical to make some inferences regarding proba￾ble hepatitis etiologies. Ecological studies such as this can
serve to generate hypotheses for more definitive studies.
In addition to the known increased mortality among
young women of child-bearing age in association with an
epidemic of hepatitis E, the increased mortality observed
here among children up to 3 years of age merits evalua￾tion and corroboration in future outbreaks.
