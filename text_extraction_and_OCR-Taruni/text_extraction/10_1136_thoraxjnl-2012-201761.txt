Abstract
Background Cigarette smoking contributes to lung remodelling in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As part of
remodelling, peribronchiolar fibrosis is observed in the small
airways of patients with COPD and contributes to airway
obstruction. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) appears to
be involved in the formation of peribronchiolar fibrosis. This study
examines the EMT process in human bronchial epithelial cells
(HBECs) from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD as
well as the in vitro effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on EMT.
Methods HBECs from non-smokers (n=5), smokers (n=12) and
patients with COPD (n=15) were collected to measure the
mesenchymal markers α-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and
collagen type I and the epithelial markers E-cadherin, ZO-1 and
cytokeratin 5 and 18 by real time-PCR and protein array. In vitro
differentiated bronchial epithelial cells were stimulated with CSE.
Results Mesenchymal markers were upregulated in HBECs of
smokers and patients with COPD compared with non-smokers. In
contrast, epithelial cell markers were downregulated. In vitro
differentiated HBECs underwent EMT after 72 h of CSE exposure
through the activation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, the
release and autocrine action of transforming growth factor β1, the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Smad3 and by the downregulation
of cyclic monophosphate.


Conclusions The EMT process is present in bronchial epithelial
cells of the small bronchi of smokers and patients with COPD and is
activated by cigarette smoke in vitro.
