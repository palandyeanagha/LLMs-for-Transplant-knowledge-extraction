Abstract
A 36-year-old female was admitted to hospital for debridement of
chronically inflamed tendon sheaths and adjacent tissues near the
left ankle. Despite antibiotic therapy and initial surgical
interventions, the inflammation had progressed slowly over 16


months. Histopathological examination of excised tissues in
September 1973 revealed a chronic granulomatous inflammation of
tendon sheaths and muscle. Many branched hyphal segments,
intercalary swollen cells, and a few conidia-like bodies were seen in
sections, and also in KOH- and PAS-stained slides prepared from
homogenized tissues. Culture of homogenized tissues yielded pure
colonies of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Sensitivity tests were initially
begun with amphotericin B, potassium iodide, and potassium
tartrate (0·05-15 μg/ml of the phytone-yeast extract agar), and no
inhibitory effect was observed. Subsequently, amphotericin B,
antimony, 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), griseofulvin, hamycin, and
mycostatin were tested (25-300 μg/ml of the phytone-yeast extract
agar). Of these chemicals, griseofulvin and hamycin proved to be
most effective. Antimony and 5-FC were ineffective, and mycostatin
produced a negligible effect on growth. The four strains of
Lysobacter antibioticus, the producer of myxin antibiotic, strongly
inhibited the growth of the fungus.
