Abstract


BACKGROUND Pneumocystis carinii is an important pathogen in
immunodeficiency but may be an unrecognised cause of respiratory
compromise.
OBJECTIVES To ascertain the incidence of P cariniipneumonia
(PCP) at presentation of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID),
whether it had been diagnosed, and the effect of treatment on
outcome.
SETTING The supraregional paediatric bone marrow transplant unit
for primary immunodeficiencies at Newcastle General Hospital.
METHODS Retrospective case note review of infants referred with a
diagnosis of SCID from 1992 to 1998.
RESULTS Ten of 50 infants had PCP at presentation; only one was
diagnosed before transfer. Eight were diagnosed by bronchoalveolar
lavage and two by lung biopsy. In only one was P cariniiidentified in
nasopharyngeal secretions. Five required ventilation for respiratory
failure but all were successfully treated with co-trimoxazole and
methylprednisolone with or without nebulised budesonide. Nine
survived to bone marrow transplantation and four are long term
survivors after bone marrow transplantation; no deaths were related
to PCP.
CONCLUSIONS PCP is a common presenting feature of SCID but is
rarely recognised. Bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy are
needed for diagnosis. Treatment with co-trimoxazole is highly
successful.
