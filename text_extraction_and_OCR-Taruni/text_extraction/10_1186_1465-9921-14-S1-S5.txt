Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease, with a median survival time of 2–5 years. The search for
effective treatment has involved numerous clinical trials of investigational agents without significant success.
However, in 2011, pirfenidone was the first drug to be approved for the treatment of IPF in Europe. Four key
clinical trials supported the efficacy and tolerability of pirfenidone.
In the two recently published Phase III CAPACITY trials evaluating pirfenidone (studies 004 and 006), patients with
mild-to-moderate IPF were treated with pirfenidone or placebo. Study 004 and pooled analysis of primary
endpoint data from both studies showed that pirfenidone significantly reduced decline in percent-predicted forced
vital capacity (FVC) compared with placebo (p<0.005). Evidence of beneficial effects of pirfenidone treatment was
also observed with regard to several secondary endpoints. Pirfenidone was generally well tolerated, with the most
common side effects being gastrointestinal and photosensitivity. Data from the RECAP extension phase of the
CAPACITY studies, where patients were treated with pirfenidone for up to three years, further support the
manageable tolerability profile of pirfenidone. The efficacy data, coupled with long-term safety data, provide further
evidence of a clinically-meaningful treatment effect with pirfenidone in patients with IPF.
Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating dis￾ease, occurring predominantly in adults of around 60–75
years of age,[1] with an estimated prevalence of IPF of
1.6–1.7/10,000.[2-4] The disease course is progressive and
ultimately fatal, with a median survival of 2–5 years [5,6]
– worse than a number of malignancies [7]. Progressive
deterioration of pulmonary function occurs, which
increasingly limits the patient’s ability to perform normal
physical activities.[8] The speed and extent of this dete￾rioration is often unpredictable,[9] with patients who gen￾erally appear to have stable disease often suffering
episodes of acute exacerbation.[10,11]
A decline in both relative and absolute changes in the
forced vital capacity (FVC) has been shown consistently to
predict mortality in patients with IPF.[12-14] A decline in
FVC of 10% or more in a six-month period is associated
with a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of mortality.
[12-15] However, whilst serial FVC measurements are a
validated marker of chronic disease progression, and
frequently used as an endpoint in clinical trials,[16-18] it is
not a proven surrogate for mortality. Nevertheless, agents
that attenuate the decline in FVC are anticipated to play
an important role in IPF management.
Pirfenidone has been shown to reduce the decline in
FVC in patients with IPF. This is an orally available drug
that exhibits anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties
in vitro and in vivo.[19-23] There is evidence to show that
pirfenidone diminishes fibroblast proliferation, secretion of
the fibrosis-associated proteins and cytokines, biosynthesis
and accumulation of extracellular matrix as well as accu￾mulation of inflammatory cells and tumour necrosis
factor-a synthesis.[19-23]
Clinical trials of pirfenidone in patients with IPF
Following evaluation in Phase II and Phase III clinical
trials in patients with IPF.[24-26], pirfenidone was
approved by the European Commission in February 2011

Pirfenidone is indicated for the treatment of patients with
mild-to-moderate IPF. Mild-to-moderate disease was char￾acterised in two pivotal Phase III studies using the follow￾ing functional criteria: FVC ≥50% of predicted value,
carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) ≥35% of pre￾dicted value and a 6 minute walk test (6MWT) distance of
≥150 m.[26]
Based on the positive results of a Phase II study by
Azuma et al.,[24] a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-con￾trolled, randomised Phase III clinical trial was conducted
in Japan to determine the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone
in 275 patients with IPF.[25] Patients were randomised to
pirfenidone 1800 mg per day, pirfenidone 1200 mg per day
or placebo using a 2:1:2 ratio, with 267 patients evaluated
for the efficacy of pirfenidone. The dose of pirfenidone was
increased in a stepwise manner up to the treatment dose
over four weeks. The primary endpoint was vital capacity
(VC) from baseline to 52 weeks. This was changed before
unblinding of the study (it was previously the lowest arter￾ial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2)
during the six-minute steady state exercise test). This deci￾sion was based on the evolved knowledge of assessment
with objective measurements in IPF, along with the lack of
validation of the steady state exercise test and problems in
reproducing SpO2 measurements. Secondary endpoints
included progression-free survival (this was defined as time
until the first progressive event, i.e. either decrease in VC
of >10% or death) and change in the lowest SpO2 during
the six-minute steady state exercise test.[25]
Statistically significant differences were observed
between the pirfenidone 1,800 mg group and the placebo
group for both the primary and secondary endpoints.
Pirfenidone was associated with a 44% reduction in the
VC decline compared with placebo (-0.09 L vs -0.16 L;
p=0.0416), along with a significant increase in progression￾free survival (p=0.0280).[25] Pirfenidone was relatively well
tolerated, the most common adverse event observed with
pirfenidone was photosensitivity, which was rated as mild
in the majority of patients,[25] and has previously been
documented as a side effect associated with pirfenidone
treatment.[25,27] The data from this Phase III trial led to
the approval of pirfenidone in Japan in 2008 for the treat￾ment of IPF.
Two concurrent, similarly designed Phase III trials (stu￾dies 004 and 006, the “CAPACITY” studies), were con￾ducted at 110 sites across North America, Australia and
11 European countries. Both were randomised, double￾blind, placebo-controlled studies with treatment periods of
72 weeks.[26] The studies were designed to confirm the
results of a Phase II study suggesting that pirfenidone
reduced the deterioration in lung function in patients with
IPF.[24]
Patients aged 40–80 years with mild-to-moderate IPF,
diagnosed within the previous 48 months, were randomised
to treatment with either oral pirfenidone or oral placebo.
In study 004, patients were assigned to pirfenidone 2403
mg/day, 1197 mg/day or placebo in a 2:1:2 ratio. In study
006, patients were assigned to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or
placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Pirfenidone was administered with
food three times a day and increased to the full dose (2403
mg/day) over two weeks. The lower dose of 1197 mg/day
was included in study 004 to investigate any dose-response
effect in terms of efficacy.[26]
The primary endpoint of both studies was change in
percentage predicted FVC from baseline to week 72. Sec￾ondary endpoints at week 72 included categorical decline
in FVC ≥10%, progression-free survival (time to confirmed
≥10% decline in percentage predicted FVC, ≥15% decline
in percentage predicted DLCO or death), mean change in
6MWT distance, mean change in percentage predicted
DLCO, mean change in dyspnoea score, mean percentage
change in worst SpO2 during 6MWT and time to worsen￾ing of IPF. Mortality was included as an exploratory end￾point. Categorical change in high-resolution computed
tomographic (HRCT)-diagnosed fibrosis was included as a
secondary endpoint in study 006.[26]
In study 004, pirfenidone 2403 mg/day significantly
reduced mean decline from baseline to week 72 in percen￾tage predicted FVC, compared with placebo (-8.0% [±16.5]
vs -12.4% [±18.5], respectively; p=0.001), as well as the pro￾portion of patients with FVC decline ≥10%. This treatment
effect was evident between weeks 24 and 72. A pirfenidone
effect was confirmed (p=0.0007) after repeat-measured
analysis of the predicted percentage change in FVC across
all assessment timepoints. In the pirfenidone 1197 mg/day
group, the primary endpoint outcomes were intermediate
to those of the 2403 mg/day pirfenidone and placebo
groups.[26]
While the difference between groups in mean FVC
change at Week 72 was not significant in Study 006
(-9.0% [SD 19.6] and -9.6% [19.1] respectively, p=0.501),
this may have been due to a lower than expected rate of
FVC decline in Study 006 after 1 year in the placebo
group.[26] Moreover, a consistent pirfenidone effect was
apparent until Week 48 (p=0.005) and also in an analysis
of all study timepoints (p=0.007). Thus, the data from
this study generally supported those from Study 004,
with a positive treatment effect of pirfenidone being
observed at all timepoints from weeks 12 to 48 but not at
later time points.[26]
The effect of pirfenidone treatment on percentage pre￾dicted FVC at week 72 was supported by pooled analysis
of data from both studies. Mean decline in percentage pre￾dicted FVC was -8.5% and -11.0% for the pirfenidone 2403
mg/day and placebo groups, respectively (p=0.005).
Additionally, the pooled analysis demonstrated a 30%
reduction in the percentage of patients with a categorical
decline in FVC ≥10% at week 72 (p=0.003), a 31% reduction

in the mean decline in 6MWT distance (p>0.001) and a
26% reduction in the risk of death or disease progression
(HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.57, 0.96; p=0.025).[26]
Exploratory analysis of mortality data revealed that the
hazard ratios for all-cause mortality (p=0.315) and mortal￾ity related to IPF at any time during the study (p=0.117),
although not significant, numerically favoured pirfenidone
over placebo. This was also the case with on-treatment
IPF-related mortality, which occurred in 3% of patients
treated with pirfenidone and 7% of those given placebo
(p=0.03).[26]
Cochrane meta-analysis of treatment effect
Meta-analyses performed by the Cochrane Collaboration,
published in 2010, investigated the treatment effect of
pirfenidone using data from the clinical trials performed
to date. Data from the two Japanese studies were eligible
for a meta-analysis as they both included the endpoint of
absolute change in VC.[28] A statistically significant dif￾ference was observed in terms of decline in VC in favour
of pirfenidone, underlining the beneficial effect of pirfeni￾done on the change in VC compared to baseline. As pro￾gression-free survival was also used as an endpoint in the
Phase III study by Taniguchi et al,[25] it was possible to
combine the data from this study and perform a meta￾analysis with data from the CAPACITY studies. The
overall result of this meta-analysis suggested that pirfeni￾done reduced the risk of disease progression by 30% (HR
0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88) in patients with IPF.[28]
Tolerability in patients with IPF
Regarding safety, pirfenidone was shown to be generally
well tolerated at the 2403 mg/day dose in the CAPACITY
studies.[26] There was no significant difference in the num￾ber of patients experiencing serious treatment-emergent
adverse events between the pirfenidone (pooled data) and
placebo groups (33% and 31% respectively). The majority of
patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day experienced
at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, with the
most common adverse events being gastrointestinal, skin
disorders and dizziness. These adverse events were consis￾tent with the known safety profile of pirfenidone and were
usually mild to moderate in severity.[24] Adverse events
leading to discontinuation occurred in 15% of pirfenidone￾treated patients and 9% of placebo-treated patients. The
most common cause of study discontinuation was IPF (3%
of patients in each group). The only other causes of treat￾ment discontinuation in the pooled pirfenidone group was
nausea (1%) and rash (1%).[26]
An extension phase of the CAPACITY studies (called
RECAP) was designed to assess the safety of pirfenidone
beyond the duration of the Phase III studies. At Week
72 of the RECAP extension study, patients had been
treated with pirfenidone for a mean duration of 2.9
years (range, 1-4). A number of patients (n=114) had
been treated at the full dose for at least three years.
Data from the RECAP extension study confirm the tol￾erability of pirfenidone.[29]
Common adverse events and those considered treat￾ment-emergent occurred in a very similar proportion of
patients to those reported during the CAPACITY studies.
Almost all patients (98%) reported at least one treatment￾emergent adverse event, compared with 99% of patients
in the CAPACITY studies across both treatment arms.
Similar proportions of patients in RECAP experienced
serious adverse events to those in the CAPACITY studies
(33% vs 33%). The incidence of common adverse events
was very similar to that observed in the CAPACITY stu￾dies, and were generally mild to moderate in severity. No
new or unexpected safety issues were observed.[29]
Rash or photosensitivity occurred in fewer patients from
the RECAP extension study than in the CAPACITY studies
(20% vs 44%). This was more common among patients
initiating treatment with pirfenidone compared with those
who were continuing with treatment (28% vs 12%). These
data provide further important information on treatment
with pirfenidone and demonstrate its tolerability.[29]
Conclusions
There has been a considerable advance in terms of
research into prognostic factors, with decline in % FVC
being found to be a predictor of mortality risk. Until
recently, therapeutic developments had lagged somewhat,
but the increase in the number of clinical trials has been
encouraging. However, many of these trials either failed
to show significant treatment benefit against this challen￾ging disease. Further studies are required to evaluate the
potential benefit of other agents, such as N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) [30] and nintedanib (BIBF 1120),[31] in IPF. The
first major step forward has been the European approval
of pirfenidone for patients with mild-to-moderate IPF.
Pirfenidone has demonstrated statistically-significant and
clinically-meaningful effects in clinical trials. Overall, pir￾fenidone provides a significant treatment benefit for
patients with IPF and represents an appropriate option as
first-line therapy for these patients.
