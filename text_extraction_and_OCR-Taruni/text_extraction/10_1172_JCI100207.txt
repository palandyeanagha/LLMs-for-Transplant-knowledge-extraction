STUDIES OF U'REA EXCRETION. III.
THE INFLUENCE OF BODY SIZE ON UREA OUPUT
By JOHN F. McINTOSH, EGGERT MOLLER, Aim DONALD D. VAN SLYKE
(From the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, New York)
(Received for publication August 21, 1928)
In the absence of data on subjects differing greatly in size, Austin,
Stillman, and Van Slyke (1) adopted, as the simplest premise, the
assumption that blood urea clearance, urine volume, and augmentation
limit vary directly as the body weight.
However, Addis (8) has found that his "urea excretion ratio," which
is the "maximum clearance," defiied in our preceding paper (6), paral￾lels more exactly the body surface area than it does the weight. Such
a relation might be anticipated, if one considers that the rate of
general metabolism, and hence probably the outputs of urea and water,
parallel the body surface, and that Dreyer (3) has shown that the
blood volume also parallels the surface area. The kidney weights,
furthermore, were shown by Taylor, Drury, and Addis (8), to vary
in rabbits in proportion to the body surface rather than to the total
body weights. The clearance values observed in the animals exam￾ined before autopsy paralleled the kidney Weights and skin areas.
Hence these authors were led to correct their urea excretion ratios
observed in patients by multiplying the observed ratios by the factor
average normal surface area
area of subject
Our experience confirms that of Addis and his colleagues. More
constant normal values are obtained if one substitutes A (= surface
area) in place of Win the clearance formulae. We have found it con￾venient to use as a unit the surface area 1.73 square meters, which is
the mean of the areas of men and women of 25, estimated from the ad￾justed medico-actuarial tables of Baldwin and Wood published by
Fiske and Crawford (5).
When corrected for body size, the formulae for standard blood urea

clearance C,, and maximum blood urea clearance Cm, defined in the
preceding paper (6), are accordingly written as
C
U 1.73 U
B A B cr
U 1.73 UX Vcor
Cm = B XV X A B
The corrected urine volume, VcOr., is the observed volume of urine in
cubic centimeter per minute multiplied by the factor 1.73, A being the
A
body area in square meters that is normal for the subject's height and
age. The clearance formulae, written with Vcor. in place of V, indi￾cate the cubic centimeters of blood per unit surface area cleared of urea
per minute, the unit of surface urea being 1.73 squaremeters. In the
case of the C, formula, with Vcor.X the value calculated indicates the
cubic centimeters blood clearance per unit surface area when the per
minute urine volume is 1 cc. per unit surface area. Blood clearance,
urine volume, and hence augmentation limit are thus all based on
surface area. (See derivation of original formula on page 102 of
Austin, Stillman and Van Slyke (1)).
The correction for body size is applied as follows. The age and
height of the subject havlng been ascertained, the value of the correc￾1.73. tion factor .-73 is read from the line chart in figure 1. The observed
value of V, in cubic centimeters of urine per minute, is multiplied by
this factor. The corrected V thus obtained is used in the standard
clearance formula, C, - BVcor., or the maximum clearance formula,
Cm = UVBor. for the calculations outlined in the preceding paper (6). B
1.73 In the correction factor 3 A represents in square meters the mean
A
surface area of normal persons of the subject's height and age. Sur￾face area is thus used as the nearest available parallel to the mass of
functioning ren'al tissue (8) present in a normal subject. Because of
the likelihood that the subjects examined will be obese, edematous, or

emaciated, it appears more eiact, for correction of the clearance values,
to use the body surface estimated from the weight wlich is ideal for a
subject of that height and age, rather thanithe actual surface estimated
from the height an'd the observed weight at the moment of observation.
For adults over 25 years of age we use as A the surface area of the aver￾age normal person of 25 and the subject's height.
Figure 1 has been constructed as follows. From the tables of Bald￾win and Wood (5) curves were constructed, with weight and height as
the co'ordinates, for mares and female's of different ages from 5'to 25.
From 5 to 15 the height-weight relation'ship could be expressed by a
single curve, but the increasing weight-height ratio duiring adolescence
necessitated 2 additional curves for the age interval' 16-25. Fr6m the
height-weight values of these curves, surface areas were calculated by
Du Bois' (4) height-weight formula, and-a second-set of curves was con￾strutted representing mean normal height-surface area relationships
for the ages covered. From these two sets of curves the scales of
figure 1 were constructed, -down -to those for the height 1.4- meter
(age about 12 years). Below this body size we have employed the data
of Benedict and Talbot (2) as given in their figures 7, 8, 10, and 13,
which give height-weight and height-area relationships down nearly to
birth. In constructing the scales'of figure 1 we have used the me'ans
of the height-weight and height-area relationships of males and fe￾males. The sexes differ too little to justify, for our purpose, separate
scales for each.
The standard clearance is affected by a given deviation from or￾dinary body size only in proportion to the deviation of A from
A
unity, since the V value by which the factor is multiplied is under the
square root sign in the formula C, = - V . Hence a variation of B
a10 per cent in surface area affects the C. by only approximately 45
per cent. Such a variation corresponds to a height range in adults
between 157 and 181 cm., or 62 and 71 inches. In determining the
standard clearance for clinical diagnosis a factor of less than 5 per
cent can be neglected; and the correction factor need be applied only
to patients outside the above limits of body size.

UREA EXCRETION
In estimating the maximum blood urea clearance, however, by the
formula Cm = B a 10 per cent correction to V causes a 10 per cent
correction to the Cm value calculated. Hence, to avoid an error
greater than :5 per cent, we can neglect body size in estimating the
maximum clearance only in adults between 164 and 176 cm., or 65 and
69 inches, in height.
EXPERIMENTAL
In order to measure satisfactorily the influence of body size on urea
excretion rate it is necessary to compare children with adults. With
ordinary adults variation in size, as a factor in influencing the volume
of blood, the urea content of which is excreted per minute, is less impor￾tant than other, unknown factors, which may be summarized as "indi￾vidual constitution." These may cause the standard or maximum
clearance of an individual, of average size and normal to all appear￾ances, to vary by as much as 25 per cent from the mean normal clear￾ance. The effect of body size is so obscured by the greater effects of
individual constitution that the size effect in adults can be measured
only by statistical methods. In order to make it an outstanding factor
it is necessary to study subjects with a greater size range than can be
obtained in the adults usually available for observation.
We have accordinglv, by the technique described in the preceding
paper (6), determined the urea excretion curves on a number of chil￾dren. The numerical data are given in table 1, and the curves in
figures 2 to 9. The correction for body size is made, as previously
described, by multiplying the observed V value by the factor A
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
It is obvious from figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, and 9, that correcting the
blood urea clearances, by multiplying the observed values of V in cc.

within the same range as the data of adults in respect to maximum
blood urea clearance and standard blood urea clearance. This manner
of correcting for body size therefore makes it possible to put on a com￾mon basis for comparison, with regard to urea excreting ability, sub￾jects of the widest range of body size that is likely to be encountered
in this type of examination.
The figures for the augmentation limit, corrected for body size, show
an average of 1.7 cc. per minute. This is somewhat lower than the
corresponding figure for normal adults (2.1 cc'.), but within the limit
of variation for adults. The augmentation limit values, show a grea-ter
inidvidual variation for children than for adults. This may be due to
the fact, that, with the small urine volumes often found in determi￾nations of the standard clearance in children, failure to empty the
bladder completely, and consequent errors in measuring the urine
volume, become of increased importance. For routine determinations
of the urea excreting function in small children it may therefore prove
advantageous when possible to give sufficient fluids to cause free diure￾sis, and determine the maximum instead of the standard clearance.
In a recent paper (7) Rabinowitch and Breitman have given for a number of
children data from which the standard dearance (corrected for surface area cal￾culated from the observed weight) can be calculated. The experimental procedure
of these authors is such that their results can not be very accurately compared with
ours. First, they give a large amount of urea just before the test, which causes the
blood urea to vary irregularly. Second, they use as the blood urea value the mean
of the two figures obtained one hour before, and shortly after the 1-hour period
from which the urine urea is determined. Third, they determine the urea output
during only a single 1-hour period on each child. However, if their data are
recalculated in such a way that the second blood urea value only is used, and the
results are plotted into our figure 11, the axis of their group falls near to that for
our 25 individuals. That the dispersion for their results is greater than for ours
is probably due to the factors mentioned above.
It does not seem necessary to present comparative calculations to
show that the area correction is more exact than the weight correction.
Such calculations may readily be made from the data in table 1. They
show that the weight formulae, u ~UV and BW yield in the children B ~BW
values for the standard and maximum clearance respectively which
are quite above the range for adults: urea excretion rates in small sub-

jects do not decrease so rapidly as body weights. They decrease
rather as the surface area, or the 2/3 power of the weight.
UV The degree of exactness with which the maximum clearance, B ,
varies in proportion to surface area in different subjects' is indicated by
figure 10 in which we have plotted against surface area the mean
maximum-clearance for each of the 7 adults reported from this labora-
'tory in the preceding paper (6), and each of the children reported in the
present paper. In figure 11 the uncorrected standard clearance,
Uv%T .
B , is similarly plotted against the square root of surface area' for
each of the 17 adults reported in the preceding paper, and each of the
children in the present one.
SUMMARY
The calculated maximum and standard blood urea clearances, pre￾viously defined (6), may be corrected for variations in body size by
means of a factor based on the assumption, introduced by'Addis (8),
that excretion varies directly as surface area.- Thus corrected, data
from small children yield the same normal v-alues as adults for the
maximum and standard clearances, and also for the augmentation
lImit of urine volume, at which maximum excretory efficiency is at￾tained.
The nature of the standard clearance formula is such that correction
for body size in'persons between 62 and 71 inches in height does not
exceed 5 per cent, and in tests of renal function may be neglected.
For the maximum clearance the range of height with'less than 5 per
cent correction is 65. to 69 inches.
