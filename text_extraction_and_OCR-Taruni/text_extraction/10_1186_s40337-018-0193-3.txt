Abstract
Background: Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is an eating disorder first described in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) [American Psychiatric Association,
Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 2013]. Patients with ARFID do not fear gaining weight or have
body image distortions. ARFID involves a persistent disturbance in feeding and eating that results in an inability to
meet nutritional and/or energy needs with one of the following: weight loss or failure to achieve appropriate weight
gain, nutritional deficiency, dependence on enteral feeding or nutritional supplements and significant interference with
psychosocial functioning. To date, studies on patients with ARFID have retrospectively applied the DSM-5 diagnostic
criteria for ARFID to reclassify patients diagnosed with DSM-IV eating disorders.
Methods: A descriptive retrospective chart review was completed on patients less than 18-years diagnosed with ARFID
after a comprehensive eating disorder assessment between May 2013 and March 2016. The data collected included
demographics, anthropometrics, historical information, clinical features, co-morbid diagnoses, need for inpatient
hospitalization and psychometric measures.
Results: Three hundred and sixty-nine patients were assessed for an eating disorder between May 2013 and March
2016. Of these, 31 (8.4%) received a DSM-5 diagnosis of ARFID. A full chart review was performed on 28 (90.3%)
patients. Weight loss or failure to achieve appropriate weight gain was the reason for diagnosis in 96.4% (27/28). All of
our patients had 2 or more physical symptoms at the time of diagnosis and 16 (57.1%) had a co-morbid psychiatric
disorder. Twenty (71.4%) reported a specific trigger for their eating disturbance. Admission for inpatient hospitalization
occurred in 57.1% (16/28) of patients. Thirteen (46.4%) patients had been previously assessed by another specialist for
their eating disturbance. None of the patients had elevated scores on commonly used psychometric tests used to
assess eating disorders.
Conclusion: This is the first study to retrospectively determine the incidence of ARFID in children and adolescents
using the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria at assessment. The clinical presentation of patients with ARFID is complex with
multiple physical symptoms and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Commonly used pediatric eating disorder
psychometric measures are not specific for making a diagnosis of ARFID, and may not be sensitive as assessment tools.

Background
Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, also known
as ARFID, is an eating disorder that was first described
in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Man￾ual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). ARFID involves a per￾sistent disturbance in feeding and eating that results in
an inability to meet nutritional and/or energy needs and
leads to at least one of the following: weight loss or fail￾ure to achieve appropriate weight gain; nutritional defi￾ciency; dependence on enteral feeding or nutritional
supplements; or significant interference with psycho￾social functioning [1]. ARFID replaces and expands on
the DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy and
early childhood [2]. Unlike patients with anorexia ner￾vosa (AN), those with ARFID do not fear gaining weight
and are not preoccupied with their body weight, shape
or size. As it is presently described, the broad clinical
features of the ARFID classification encompasses a het￾erogeneous patient population.
Previous studies examining the incidence and clinical
characteristics of children and adolescents with ARFID
in pediatric tertiary care eating disorder programs have
found the incidence to be between 5 and 14% [3, 4].
These studies found that patients with ARFID were
more likely to be younger and male, have a longer dur￾ation of illness, and present more often before the age of
12 compared to patients with AN or bulimia nervosa
(BN). Another study found the prevalence of ARFID in
an eating disorder day hospital to be 22.5% [5]. However,
these studies retrospectively applied the DSM-5 diagnos￾tic criteria for ARFID to reclassify children and adoles￾cents diagnosed with DSM-IV eating disorders. An
Australian population-based survey assessed for diagnos￾tic features of DSM-5 eating disorders in individuals
over age 15 years and found the 3-month prevalence of
ARFID and AN to be 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively [6].
However, there is no literature describing the incidence
and clinical presentation of children and adolescents
with ARFID prospectively following a comprehensive
eating disorder1 assessment in a tertiary care pediatric
eating disorder program.
In addition, very little information is known about
how patients with a clinical diagnosis of ARFID respond
on commonly used eating disorder psychometric mea￾sures. A 4-year retrospective chart review of children
and adolescents admitted to an eating disorder day pro￾gram used the Children’s Eating Attitudes Test (ChEAT)
to assess eating disorder symptoms. Patients meeting
criteria for ARFID had significantly lower total scores on
this measure relative to patients meeting criteria for AN
and BN, indicating fewer classic eating disorder symp￾toms [6]. They had a higher comorbidity of anxiety dis￾orders, pervasive developmental disorders and learning
disorders and a lower comorbidity of depressed mood,
as assessed using the Children’s Depression Inventory
(CDI), Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale and
The Child Behavior Checklist, compared to patients with
other eating disorders. This chart review also involved
patients that were retrospectively reclassified using the
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. There is no literature describ￾ing psychometric measures for children and adolescents
newly diagnosed with ARFID during a comprehensive
assessment.
The objective of this study was to determine the inci￾dence of ARFID using the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria at
assessment in a pediatric tertiary care eating disorder
program and describe the clinical and psychological
characteristics of children and adolescents with ARFID.
Methods
A retrospective chart review was completed. All patients
under the age of 18 years who received a diagnosis of
ARFID after a comprehensive eating disorder assessment
in a tertiary care pediatric hospital between May 2013
and April 2016 were included in this study. The compre￾hensive assessment consisted of a diagnostic evaluation
with the patient and with family members by either a
trained psychiatrist or psychologist using the DSM-5 cri￾teria, medical assessment by an adolescent medicine spe￾cialist or nurse practitioner, a nutritional assessment by
a dietician with experience in eating disorders and a bat￾tery of psychometric measures.
Demographics, historical and clinical features
Data collected comprised of information that existed in
the patient’s medical record at the time of the assess￾ment. Data included age, gender and ethnicity; vital signs
including heart rate, blood pressure and temperature;
EKG findings, including a calculated QTc interval; blood
work including complete blood count, potassium, phos￾phate, magnesium, calcium, sodium, glucose; duration of
illness (defined as the reported outset of nutritional re￾striction up until the date of the assessment); highest
and lowest reported weights in the last year; daily caloric
intake (24-h dietary recall) at time of assessment by the
dietician; menstrual and pubertal status; referral source;
and the presence of coexisting medical conditions. Add￾itional information collected included food allergies; his￾tory of a choking episode; history of food avoidance or
food refusal; purging; excessive exercise, defined as exer￾cise for 7 or more hours per week or any regular exer￾cise accompanied by moderate to severe distress when
the patient cannot exercise [6]; enteral supplement use;
associated symptoms such as dysphagia, abdominal pain,
fear of vomiting, generalized anxiety with eating, early
satiety, nausea, sensory issues related to food texture
and smell; and a history of being a picky eater. Finally,
reported presence of past history or present co-morbid
Cooney et al. Journal of Eating Disorders (2018) 6:7 Page 2 of 8

psychiatric diagnosis, family history of an eating disorder
or other psychiatric diagnosis were also collected.
Anthropometrics
Weight in a gown and height were measured by nursing
staff. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated (kg/m2)
and BMI percentile was determined using WHO growth
charts. Target goal weight (TGW) was determined by di￾eticians and physicians using the patient’s pre-morbid
growth trajectory in height and weight and pubertal
stage [7]. Percentage of TGW and percentage of body
weight lost, defined as current weight divided by weight
before the onset of the eating disturbance were
determined.
Psychometric measures
The eating disorder assessment at SickKids includes a
psychometric battery of tests: Children’s Depression In￾ventory (CDI), the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for
Children (MASC), the Eating Disorder Examination
Questionnaire (EDE- Q), the Children’s Eating Attitude
Test (ChEAT), the Eating Disorder Inventory for Chil￾dren (EDI-C) and the Eating Disorder Inventory - 3
(EDI-3) were collected. Of note, in the spring of 2015
the Department of Psychology at SickKids started using
the CDI 2 instead of the CDI and the MASC 2 instead
of the MASC. Although data from the different versions
of the CDI and MASC cannot be analyzed together, data
from both measures were analyzed separately and com￾pared to look for overall markers of depression and anx￾iety respectively, as well as overall trends on the specific
subscales, most of which are similar between the two
versions of the measures.
The CDI is a 27-item self-report measure that evalu￾ates depression in children and adolescents ages 7–
17 years [8]. It consists of 5 subscales: Negative mood,
Interpersonal problems, Ineffectiveness, Anhedonia, and
Negative Self-esteem. It also provides a total score. The
CDI 2 is a revision of the CDI [9]. It contains 2 scales:
Emotional problems and Functional problems and 4
subscales: Negative mood, Negative self-esteem, Ineffect￾iveness, and Interpersonal problems. It also provides a
total score. To allow for comparisons between versions,
T scores of 65 and higher were considered elevated.
The MASC is a 39-item self-reported measure used to
assess anxiety in ages 8–19 years [10]. It includes 4
scales: Physical symptoms, Harm avoidance, Social anx￾iety, and Separation/Panic. It also measures total anxiety.
The MASC 2 is a revision of the MASC and contains 50
items across 6 scales: Separation anxiety/ Phobias, GAD
index, Social anxiety, Obsessions and compulsions,
Physical symptoms and Harm avoidance. It also provides
a total score [11]. T scores of 65 and higher were consid￾ered elevated.
The EDI-3 is a self-report measure of psychological
traits in individuals with eating disorders ages 13–
53 years [12]. It has 91 items organized in 12 primary
scales, in which 3 are eating disorder specific: Drive for
thinness, Bulimia, and Body dissatisfaction. Nine are
general psychological scales: Low self-esteem, Personal
alienation, Interpersonal insecurity, Interpersonal alien￾ation, Interoceptive deficits, Emotional dysregulation,
Perfectionism, Asceticism, and Maturity fears. T scores
of 60 and higher were considered elevated. The EDI-C is
a version of the measure for use in children 12 years and
under. It has 5 subscales: Drive for thinness, Emotional
instability, Self-esteem, Overeating and Maturity fears
[13]. T scores of 65 and higher were considered elevated.
The EDE-Q is a 33-item self-reported screen used to
evaluate for eating disorders for children over 13 years.
It measures disordered eating over a 28-day period and
is scored across 4 sub-scales: Eating concern, Shape con￾cern, Weight concern, Dietary restraint [14, 15]. It also
includes a global score, which is an average of the sub￾scales. Subscale scores of 4 and higher were considered
elevated.
The ChEAT is a 26-item self-report measure assessing
eating behaviors of 9–13 year olds [16]. The three sub￾scales include: Dieting, Bulimia/Food preoccupation and
Oral control. Items are scored as a total score, which is
a sum of all the item ratings. A total score of 20 and
higher was considered elevated.
Statistical analysis
Analysis comprised of descriptive statistics. Data were
collected and stored electronically in a spreadsheet for￾mat. Central tendency of continuous measures were rep￾resented using means and the variability with standard
deviations and the range of each variable. Categorical
variables were represented with percentages along with
the actual counts so that missing measures are apparent.
Consent to participate was required by all patients
who met criteria to be included and were actively receiv￾ing eating disorder treatment in the tertiary care pro￾gram. This study was approved by the Research Ethics
Board at SickKids.
Results
At the time of the study, a total of 369 patients were
assessed by the eating disorder program between May
2013 and April 2016; after a comprehensive eating dis￾order assessment, 31 (8.4%) received a DSM-5 diagnosis
of ARFID. The diagnoses of other children and adoles￾cents during that time are outlined in Table 1. Three of
the 31 patients with ARFID declined to participate in
the study. Therefore, 28 out of the 31 patients diagnosed
with ARFID had a complete chart review.
Cooney et al. Journal of Eating Disorders (2018) 6:7 Page 3 of 8

The diagnosis of ARFID was made using the DSM-5
criteria. The prevalence and breakdown of the categories
for the first diagnostic criteria - weight loss or failure to
achieve appropriate weight gain; nutritional deficiency;
dependence on enteral feeding or nutritional supple￾ments; or significant interference with psychosocial
functioning [1] were examined in this cohort. The diag￾nostic criteria used by clinicians to make a diagnosis of
ARFID in this population included weight loss or failure
to achieve appropriate weight gain in 96.4% (27/28) and
dependence on nutritional supplements in 3.6% (1/28).
No children or adolescents were diagnosed due to nutri￾tional deficiency or significant interference with psycho￾social functioning.
Table 2 demonstrates the clinical characteristics of pa￾tients who received a diagnosis of ARFID. Of the 31 pa￾tients with a diagnosis of ARFID, 64.5% (20/31), were
female with a mean age of 13.2 (SD = 2. 3; range = 9.3–
17.6 years). The duration of illness prior to diagnosis
was 28.9 months (SD = 39.6; range = 1–153) and 60.7%
(17/28) of patients had a duration of illness of longer
than 12 months. Table 3 displays the presenting symp￾toms of patients with ARFID. All of the patients had 2
or more physical symptoms, such as abdominal pain,
vomiting or early satiety. Of interest, almost all the
patients had decreasing portion sizes and greater than
50% of the group reported food avoidance, history of
nausea, early satiety or abdominal pain. In addition, 71.
4% (20/28) of patients reported a trigger for their eating
disturbance. These included abdominal pain (n = 5),
bullying (n = 3), death of a family member or friend (n =
2), starting a medication (n = 2), having emesis (n = 2) or
witnessing emesis (n = 1), concern for food allergy (n =
2) and concern for animal rights (n = 1).
Almost half of the patients (46.4%, (n = 13)), with a
diagnosis of ARFID were seen by other specialists or
sub-specialists for their eating disturbance prior to being
referred to the tertiary care pediatric eating disorder
program. These sub-specialists included psychiatry (n =
6), endocrinology (n = 3), nutrition (n = 2), allergy (n = 1)
and gastroenterology (n = 1).
Patients with ARFID were found to present with sig￾nificant weight loss or other medical compromise. In
this study 17.9% (n = 5) of patients had lost more than
20% of their body weight before receiving a diagnosis. In
addition, 39.3% (n = 11) presented with a weight of less
than 80% of their TGW. Admission to hospital occurred
in in 57.1% (16/28) of patients; 9 were admitted because
of a body weight that was less than 80% of the TGW, 6
were admitted for failing to gain weight as an outpatient
and 1 was admitted because of bradycardia.
Not all patients who received a diagnosis chose to be
followed by our eating disorder program. Over the study
period, 32.2% (10/31) of patients who received a diagno￾sis of ARFID at the initial assessment were either
followed by a different eating disorder program (n = 6)
or a primary care provider (n = 4).
Table 4 outlines selected psychometric data for patients
with ARFID. The sample size for the psychometric mea￾sures was highly variable. Each individual psychometric
measure was given to a patient if they were within the age
range that the measure was validated for. In addition,
some patients may have failed to complete the entire

Figure 1 demonstrates the psychiatric comorbidities re￾ported by the psychiatrist or psychologist who assessed
the patients with ARFID. A co-morbid psychiatric diagno￾sis was present in 57.1% (16/28) of patients. Of the pa￾tients with a psychiatric co-morbidity, more than half (n =
10) had a co-morbid anxiety disorder. In addition, 25% (4/
16) of the patients with a psychiatric co-morbidity had
more than 1 co-morbid diagnosis.
Discussion
This is the first study to report the incidence of ARFID
in a tertiary care pediatric eating disorder program in a
group of children and adolescents that received the
DSM-5 diagnosis at the time of their initial assessment.
To date, all published studies reporting the incidence of
ARFID use assessments which have been retrospectively
reclassified using the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The in￾cidence was found to be 8.4% and is consistent with pre￾viously published literature that used reclassified data
from tertiary care eating disorder programs [3, 4].
This study demonstrates that the clinical presentation
of children and adolescents with ARFID is complex with
multiple physical symptoms. This has been demon￾strated in other studies that have applied diagnostic cri￾teria retrospectively [3]. The high number of patients
that had a reported trigger for the onset of their eating
disturbance highlights that although there is a prolonged
duration of illness in many children and adolescents
with ARFID, symptoms often have a clearly delineated
onset.
Because research on ARFID is limited, clinical under￾standing of this new diagnosis has depended largely on
retrospective chart review and case studies. This study
reveals that the majority of children and adolescents pre￾sented with decreasing portion sizes and greater than
half presented with symptoms such as food avoidance,
history of nausea, early satiety or abdominal pain; all
non-specific symptoms. The non-specific presentation of
ARFID is highlighted by noting that almost half of the
patients (n = 13) had their eating disturbance assessed in
the past by a different sub-specialist. This suggests that
in many cases primary care providers and sub-specialists
are not recognizing the presentations of these patients
as being consistent with an eating disorder and more
specifically are not identifying children and adolescents
with ARFID. Although these non-specific presenting
symptoms on their own may make a diagnosis of ARFID
challenging, it is important for future research to under￾stand how to support the diagnosis of challenging cases
so that prompt and appropriate referral can occur with￾out lengthening the duration of illness. The long interval
between developing a nonspecific cadre of symptoms,
being diagnosed with an eating disorder and starting
treatment has the potential to result in medical compli￾cations and effect on quality of life. Earlier recognition
of ARFID and implementation of eating disorder treat￾ment may prevent medical compromise and
hospitalization in some patients. Further, it may also in￾form broader public health prevention strategies.
There is an inherent selection bias in this sample. The
patients in this study are from a pediatric tertiary care
eating disorder center (8–18 years old). The majority of

the referrals include patients who have a significant
weight loss, growth failure or were medically unstable
[7]. As such, this study population is less likely to in￾clude patients who present with no weight loss, patients
who are younger than 8 years old and patients who
would receive an ARFID diagnosis because of a signifi￾cant interference with psychosocial functioning. Thus,
this study sample may not be representative of the larger
pediatric ARFID population.
Little prior data exists on the psychological character￾istics and psychometric results of children and adoles￾cents receiving a diagnosis of ARFID. In this study, none
of the patients had elevated scores on the CDI. This sug￾gests that depression, based on the psychometric mea￾sures, was not present in children and adolescents with
ARFID. This finding is consistent with Nicely et al. who
showed that patients who retrospectively met criteria for
ARFID had a lower comorbidity of depression than
those who met criteria for other eating disorders [5].
Two patients however, had a clinical diagnosis of major
depressive disorder (2/28) but did not have elevated
scores on the CDI. The CDI is often used as a screen for
depression and should not be used to diagnose depres￾sion, but rather corroborate the clinical diagnosis [17].
Therefore, one needs to use caution when interpreting
the results from self-report inventories like the CDI. Fi￾nally, this study included a relatively small sample size
and consequently the results need to be carefully inter￾preted in this context.
This study found that only 16.7% (4/24) of patients
had elevated scores on the MASC. This is fewer than ex￾pected based on the number of patients in the study
with clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders (10/28) at the
time of assessment. Nicely et al. found that Revised Chil￾dren’s Manifest Anxiety Scale scores were not different
between patients who met criteria for ARFID and pa￾tients who met criteria for AN. However, they found that
patients who met criteria for ARFID had significantly
more clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders than those
with AN. This highlights a few interesting consider￾ations. First, the discrepancies between the scores on
self-report measures of anxiety and the clinical diagnosis
of anxiety may be accounted for in part by difficulty in
responding to the questions (e.g., inability to understand
questions). Further, these instrument may not be suitable
to discriminate between psychometric and clinical diag￾nosis in tertiary care populations of children with
ARFID. Finally, complexity is introduced by the fact that
anxiety disorders differ in type and symptoms, coupled
with recent evidence that suggests that ARFID includes
a variety of subtypes. Thus, the current psychometric
measure may not be able to assess the complexities of
anxiety in the context of a heterogeneous diagnosis like
ARFID. Further research is needed in developing and
evaluating psychometric measures for anxiety in children
and adolescents with ARFID.
Nicely et al. also found that patients who retrospect￾ively met criteria for ARFID had significantly lower total
scores on the ChEAT than patients with other eating
disorders, indicating fewer classic eating disorder behav￾iors [5]. We found that 3/11 patients had elevated scores
on the ChEAT. All patients who had elevated scores
were highest on the oral control scale. Nicely et al. found
that there was no significant difference between patients
who met criteria for ARFID and patients who met cri￾teria for other eating disorders on the oral control sub￾scale [5]. Dovey et al. assessed screening for ARFID
using the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment
Scale and the Child Food Neophobia Scale and found
that these measures were both able to discriminate clin￾ical and non-clinical cases of ARFID in children ages 24
to 84 months [18]. At present, there are no reliable and
validated psychometric tests used to assess for ARFID in
older children and adolescents.
The EDE-Q is one of the most widely used eating dis￾order assessments [19], however we found that none of
the 13 patients who completed this measure had ele￾vated scores on any EDE-Q subscale. In addition, none
of the patients had elevated scores on Drive for Thin￾ness, Bulimia, Body Dissatisfaction and ED Risk Com￾posite Subscales on EDI-3 or on the Drive for Thinness
and Overeating subscales on the EDI-C. Our study sug￾gests that patients with ARFID may not be identified on
psychometric screens commonly used to evaluate eating
disorders such as AN or BN. Future research should
consider modifying existing tools or developing new

psychometric tools to help in the evaluation of children
and adolescents with ARFID, as currently used psycho￾metric scales are not useful in identifying young people
with this diagnosis.
Limitations to this study include its retrospective de￾sign and limited sample size. Despite these limitations
this study provides insight into the often complex clin￾ical presentations of patients with ARFID. The non￾specific nature of ARFID frequently results in delayed
diagnosis even in those with growth failure and medical
compromise. Future retrospective and prospective stud￾ies that further characterize ARFID and examine treat￾ments are needed.
Conclusion
This is the first study to retrospectively determine the
incidence of ARFID in children and adolescents diag￾nosed with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria at their initial
assessment. This study confirms that there is a very het￾erogeneous group that is receiving the diagnosis within
an eating disorder treatment program. The clinical pres￾entation of children and adolescents with ARFID is com￾plex with multiple physical symptoms and comorbid
psychiatric disorders. Commonly used pediatric eating
disorder psychometric scales are not useful in identifying
children and adolescents with ARFID. As we learn more
about the diagnostic category of ARFID we recognize
that this is a heterogeneous group of patients. Perhaps a
greater emphasis on understanding ARFID subtypes will
help us to better delineate the characteristics and symp￾toms that will aid in developing specific psychometric
scales. Research on the prevalence and psychopathology
of ARFID in the pediatric population is still in its infancy
and is limited by the lack of validated instruments to
measure these eating behaviors and associated comor￾bidities. This study incorporated a standard battery of
psychometric tests that has historically been used in our
tertiary care pediatric eating disorder program even be￾fore the advent of ARFID as a diagnostic category in the
DSM-5. This study identified the limitations of these
psychometric tests in this population. Clearly, future re￾search on ARFID should include the development of
valid and reliable psychometric tests that focus on assist￾ing both in the diagnosis of ARFID and its associated
mental health disorders. Psychometric properties that
tap into the severity of ARFID, the complexity of the
