Abstract
Background: Complications of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with mechanical defects are
associated with poor prognosis. Surgical intervention is indicated for a majority of these patients.
The goal of surgical intervention is to improve the systolic cardiac function and to achieve a
hemodynamic stability. In this present study we reviewed the outcome of patients with post
infarction ventricular septal defect (PVSD) who underwent cardiac surgery.
Methods: We analysed retrospectively the hospital records of 41 patients, whose ages range from
48 to 81, and underwent a surgical treatment between 1990 and 2005 because of PVSD.
Results: In 22 patients concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CAGB) was performed. In 15
patients a residual shunt was found, this required re-op in seven of them. The time interval from
infarct to rupture was 8.7 days and from rupture to surgery was 23.1 days. Hospital mortality in
PVSD group was 32%. The mortality of urgent repair within 3 days of intractable cardiogenic shock
was 100%. The mortality of patients with an anterior VSD and a posterior VSD was 29.6% vs 42.8%,
respectively. All patients who underwent the surgical repair later than day 36 survived.
Conclusion: Surgical intervention is indicated for a majority of patients with mechanical
complications. Cardiogenic shock remains the most important factor that affects the early results.
The surgical repair of PVSD should be performed 4–5 weeks after AMI. To improve surgical
outcome and hemodynamics the choice of surgical technique and surgical timing as well as
preoperative management should be tailored for each patient individually.

namic stability. Complications of acute myocardial infarc￾tion that develop within the first 2 weeks after its onset
have been associated with a poor prognosis. Cardiogenic
shock as a result of involvement of more than 40% of ven￾tricular mass [2], develops in 10% to 27% of these
patients [3]. Relative contraindications for cardiac surgery
are EF < 30% at rest myocardium, right ventricular (RV)
failure, pulmonary hypertension (PHT), mitral insuffi￾ciency 3rd degree (MI) and diffuse coronary artery disease
(CAD) without a possibility of revascularisation. A VSD
will develop in approximately 1% of survivors [4] and
generally occurs one week after the acute event [5].
Anterior septal rupture is caused by anterolateral infarc￾tion when 32% of the left ventricle and 10% of the right
ventricle were infarcted. Posterior septal rupture is caused
by inferoseptal infarction, which results from occlusion of
the dominant right coronary artery and occurs in the prox￾imal half of the posterior septum [6] when 21% of the left
ventricle and 31% of the right ventricle were infarcted.
That is the reason why right ventricular dysfunction as the
main determinant [7].
Septal perforation develops on the average 2–3 days after
myocardial infarction. Eighty-five percent of patients with
acquired VSD or more will die within 2 months without
surgical intervention [8]. Significant factors for hospital
mortality included: preoperative and evolution of the
clinical status, right ventricular function and type of
repair. Mortality with only medical treatment is extremely
high, over 90% [9]; mortality after surgical repair varies
between 19% and 60% in different studies [10,11]. Due to
of necrotic myocardium and friable endocardial tissue,
the suture of the Dacron patch is difficult with a high risk
of recurrence of the VSD and subsequent mortality [12].
The first surgical repair of post infarction VSD was per￾formed by Cooley in 1957 [13]. Daggett and colleagues
[14] reported satisfactory results, including reduced mor￾tality and improved cardiac function. In 1990, Komeda
and coworkers [15] offered a new concept of surgical
repair of post infarction VSD, which they called the "inf￾arct exclusion method".
The purpose of this retrospective investigation concerning
post infarction ventricular septal defect (PVSD) was to
summarize clinical results by this life-threatening compli￾cation in our high-volume cardiac surgery centre North
Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Methods
Study population
Between 1990 and 2005, 41 consecutive patients under￾went a surgical treatment because of post infarction ven￾tricular septal defect (PVSD). Preoperative characteristics
included gender, age, localisation of the (PVSD), VSD
diameter, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAmean), L-R
shunt (L-R), ejection fraction (EF), requirement for
intraaortic ballon pump (IABP) and preoperative throm￾bolysis therapy due to myocardial infarction, (Table 1).
Preoperative echocardiographic investigations (inclusive
VSD diameter) were performed through the cardiologist
at the time of admission, and postoperative echocardio￾graphic investigations were performed three days after the
surgery.
The time intervals from infarct to rupture and from rup￾ture to surgery were analysed. The outcome and the mor￾tality of all patients were collected and are summarized in
Table 2. In all patients VSD patch closure was performed
using Teflon or bovine pericardium. In all cases the ven￾tricular septal reconstruction included resection of the inf￾arcted area together with the ventricular septal
reconstruction. Moreover, in 22 patients concomitant cor￾onary artery bypass grafting (CAGB) was performed. All
patients who left hospital were followed up by personal
examination or by information received from the referring
cardiologist. Data obtained included survival.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by using commercial
statistic software (Statistica 5.1.®, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA). Data are expressed as mean ± SD for continuous
data and as percentages for categorical data. Patient sur￾vival rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier
life table method.
Results
Our patient cohort consisted of 41 patients with PVSD.
We found a predominance of male sex compared to
female (m = 30/female = 11). The mean age of PVSD
patients at follow-op was 68 ± 8.2 years and ages range
from 48 to 81. The VSD was anterior (ant) in 27 patients

and posterior (post) in 14 patients. Twenty-nine were in
cardiogenic shock and the preoperative NYHA classifica￾tion was III-IV when operated. Preoperative IABP support
was used in 19 patients, 8 were ventilated, and 13 patients
had thrombolytic therapy. Preoperative mean PA value
was 32.09 ± 6.2, L-R shunt was 57.82 ± 20.21%, and EF
was 47.24 ± 14.44%. The mean diameter of ventricle sep￾tal defect was 27.17 ± 11.9 mm (min.5 mm to max. 45
mm). Average time between acute myocardial infarction
(AMI) and VSD development was 8.7 days and from VSD
to surgery was 23.1 days. The interval between AMI and
surgery was 32 ± 25 days. Seventeen patients had 1 vessel
CAD, 11 patients 2 vessel CAD and 13 patients had 3 ves￾sel CAD, respectively. VSD patch closure was performed in
all patients (Teflon or bovine pericardium). In 22 cases
patients received a concomitant CABG. Eight of 13
patients who had received a preoperative thrombolysis
therapy due to myocardial infarction, survived.
In hospital mortality was 32%. The mortality of urgent
repair within 3 days in 5 cases of intractable cardiogenic
shock was 100%. All patients who underwent the surgical
repair later than day 36 survived. In 15 patients the rou￾tinely postoperative echocardiographic investigation
revealed a residual shunt. Seven of them were rescheduled
three weeks later after the first operation to repeat the VSD
closure, because the residual shunt was haemodynami￾cally relevant. Four patients required ventricle assist
device postoperative, one patient is still alive. The 30 day
mortality was 34.1% for the whole series. Twenty-seven
patients are still alive. Mortality in post VSD group was
42.8%, and in the group with ant VSD 29.6% (Table 2).
Overall surgical mortality was significantly higher in the
early period after AMI. The cumulative survival analysis is
shown as Kaplan-Meier survival function (Figure 1).
Discussion
PVSD was first described by Latham in 1846 [16] and is
known to develop in only 1% of patients with acute myo￾cardial infarction [11]. The most important parameters for
prognosis are infarct localization, myocardial function
and timing of operation. A prompt diagnosis and imme￾diate cardiac support (IABP or ventricular assist device) is
recommended especially in PVSD. Patient survival is
directly related to the state of cardiac function at the time
of the operation [11].
The development of shock is the most important predic￾tor of survival. Persistence of class IV cardiogenic shock in
PVSD is associated with 100% mortality [17]. These find￾ings are in line with our results concerning emergency
operation. Worst results were observed in patients with
lack of improvement hemodynamic status in spite the use
of an IABP. The use of a preoperative balloon pump
reflects the condition of the patient before surgery. In
patients who are seen more than 2 weeks after onset of
AMI, the operative survival is about 70% [18]. The surgical
results are improved if the patients can survive for at least
4 weeks, which may be necessary for significant scar for￾mation of the margins of the VSD. One important risk fac￾tor is the interval between the myocardial infarction and
rupture of the septum. Intervention early is associated
with a higher risk [19], explained by the very reduced
quality of the tissues near the septal perforation on one
hand, and by the reduced functional status of the patients
who have to be operated upon very early. Otherwise,
Labrousse et al. 2003 [12] recommend an early repair of
post infarction VSD, even when the patient is in cardio￾genic shock. Moreover, the authors described that the
delay of surgery was directly correlated to the preoperative
status because a lots of the patients die before surgery. Fur￾ther, they claimed the ethical problem to delay the opera￾tion. However, in their study all late repairs of PVSD were
excluded and it could be conceivable, that the mortality
rate in "late repairs of PVSD" would achieve a different
mortality rate.

Our results concerning the emergent surgery within 3 days
after AMI are poor. However, these five cases were oper￾ated as ultimo ratio under poor hemodynamic condi￾tions. Comparison of mortality between different
institutions remains unreliable. Indeed, patients are usu￾ally first referral to cardiologist centres, and a part of the
patients (depending of cardiologist habit) might be con￾sidered not suitable and then not referred to surgery. So, a
part of the discrepancy in operative results between insti￾tutions might be attributed to variable recruitment and
the in-hospital mortality reflects in part institutional hab￾its. As in our series, the improvement of hospital mortality
in the last years is usually found in other studies [12,20].
The decision, to operate a patient who is in cardiogenic
shock should be tailored for each patient individually.
Some studies showed no benefit of CABG while others
found evidence for concomitant CABG to be advanta￾geous. It has been shown that concomitant myocardial
revascularization decreases operative mortality and
improves long-term survival [21]. We could not prove any
influence of concomitant CABG on late survival of our
patients, but patients who have multivessel disease
should be routinely revascularised [22].
Cardiogenic shock prior to surgery influenced early sur￾vival and preoperative IABP increases cardiac output and
decrease the left to right shunt with an improvement cor￾onary perfusion. The need for mechanical ventilation was
not a result of delaying operation but to aid in manage￾ment of pulmonary oedema and/or cardiogenic shock. A
longer time between AMI and surgery favoured survival.
Time period from AMI to VSD seems to be a significant
factor of survival. It is clear that the higher mortality in
patients operated on early is also due to the seriousness of
hemodynamic conditions which do not allow any delay
in surgical treatment. Higher mortality reported in poste￾rior VSD can either be related to greater technical difficul￾ties associated with surgical repair or to a higher incidence
of right ventricular failure [19,20]; the size of the left-to￾right shunt is inversely correlated with the extent of infarc￾tion and directly correlated with residual ventricular func￾tion. Patients who survived operative repair had larger
shunts on. Survivors had better left ventricular function
preoperatively. Chronic VSD is easier to repair since the
septum is well scarred and the patch can be securely
sutured [23]. Moreover, our results show an increased
mortality in patients who had been underwent a throm￾bolysis preoperative. This result is line with the finding of
Crenshaw et al. [11].
In literature, VSD recurrence appeared between 10% and
40% [24] due to perioperative failure of the repair, espe￾cially in the posterior localization, because the technical
repair there is more challenging. The pathogenesis of
residual shunts may be due to incomplete closing of the
shunt at operation under certain conditions. Our results
are similar concerning VSD recurrence.
Taken together, surgical intervention is indicated for a
majority of patients with mechanical complications. Car￾diogenic shock remains the most important factor that
affects the early results. The surgical repair of PVSD is
mandatory. After confirming diagnosis and evaluation of
coronary arteries prompt attempts should be done to sta￾bilize the patient since PVSD closure should be performed
4–5 weeks after AMI. LV dysfunction, time interval
between VSD-OP and associated organ functions are pre￾dictors of operative mortality. Patients who benefit most
from the operation were those with a normal postopera￾tive contraction pattern, where ejection fraction
improved. These patients present a satisfactory survival
and quality of life.
Recently, some authors had reported about a new therapy
of a postinfarction VSD with an interventional acute VSD
closure [25-27]. However, to date our knowledge postinf￾arction VSD closure with the less invasive technique still
remains limited. Furthermore, there are no data about
long term efficacy which could compare the results of sur￾gical closure. This could be a promising therapy and may
offer an alternative to surgery.
It is important to note that this study suffered from impor￾tant limitations. The main limitation of this study is the
retrospective nature of our work. Moreover, our study
population was smaller than multi-centre studies. How￾ever, our single centre observation study has compara￾tively a relative large number of patients undergoing a
PVSD reconstruction between 1990 and 2005. Thus, this
study has the strength to show intuitional experiences in
patients undergoing a PVSD reconstruction over a long
period.
Conclusion
We recommend a delay of operation, because the mortal￾ity in patients who underwent a surgical repair of the
PVSD in first 2 weeks after AMI is extremely high. Early
repair and posterior rupture are predictors of early mortal￾ity; safe operation is feasible about 2 weeks after perfora￾tion of the septum. But of course, in patients with
cardiogenic shock urgent operation becomes necessary
and the choice of surgical technique and surgical timing as
well as preoperative management should be tailored for
each patient individually.
