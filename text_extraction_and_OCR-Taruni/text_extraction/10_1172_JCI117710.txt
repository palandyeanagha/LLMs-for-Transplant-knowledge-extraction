Abstract Introduction
Angiotensin II (ANG II) is known to be a potent growth
promoting factor for vascular smooth muscle cells and fi￾broblasts but little is known about its influence on growth
in endothelial cells. We studied the effects of ANG II on
endothelial growth and the role of the angiotensin receptor
subtypes involved. Proliferation of rat coronary endothelial
cells (CEC) and rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)
was determined by [3H] thymidine incorporation, the MTT￾test and by directly counting cells in a coulter counter. An￾giotensin AT1- and AT2-receptors were demonstrated by
binding studies and by the presence of their respective
mRNA through reverse transcription polymerase chain re￾action (RT-PCR).
In contrast to VSMC, which in culture only express the
AT1-receptor, CEC express both, AT1- and AT2-receptors
simultaneously up to the third passage. Whereas ANG II
stimulated growth of quiescent VSMC, an effect abolished
by pretreatment with the ATl-receptor antagonist, losartan,
ANG II did not induce proliferation in quiescent CEC. How￾ever, after pretreatment of quiescent endothelial cells
(< passage 4) with the AT2-receptor antagonist, PD 123177,
ANG II induced proliferation. This effect was reversed by
additional pretreatment with losartan. ANG II significantly
inhibited the proliferation of bFGF-stimulated CEC in a
dose-dependent manner by maximally 50%. This effect was
prevented by PD 123177 while losartan was ineffective. The
AT2-receptor agonist, CGP 42112, mimicked the antiprolif￾erative actions of ANG II, confirming the specificity of the
effect.
Our results show that the growth modulating actions of
ANG II depend on the type of angiotensin receptor present
on a given cell. In coronary endothelial cells, the antiprolif￾erative actions of the AT2-receptor offset the growth pro￾moting effects mediated by the AT1-receptor. (J. Clin. In￾vest. 1995. 95:651-657.) Key words: angiotensin receptors

Angiotensin II (ANG II),' the main effector peptide of the
renin-angiotensin system, has long been known to play an
important role in the regulation of blood pressure and body fluid
homeostasis. More recently, ANG II has been reported to induce
hyperplasia or hypertrophy in cultured vascular smooth muscle
cells derived from the aorta ( 1-4), in small resistance arteries
(5) and in cardiomyocytes (6).
We have previously observed that chronic oral treatment
of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with an angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitor induced myocardial capillary
growth independently of the antihypertensive and antihypertro￾phic actions of the drug (7). Theoretically, this effect could be
due to a potentiation of endogenous kinins or to a reduced
generation of ANG II. In the latter case, one would have to
expect an antiproliferative effect of ANG II on myocardial endo￾thelial cells which gives rise to cardiac capillaries. This hypothe￾sis is at variance with the widely accepted idea of ANG II being
a growth promoting factor in cardiovascular tissues. However,
using coronary endothelial cells (CEC) from SHR and normo￾tensive Wistar Kyoto rats in primary culture, we recently found
that ANG II significantly attenuated proliferation when growth
was stimulated by fetal calf serum (8, 9). Thus, in contrast to its
proliferating effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC),
ANG II may indeed exert antiproliferative actions on vascular
endothelial cells.
VSMC in culture, a common cell line to study the trophic
effects of ANG II, exclusively express ATI- and no AT2-recep￾tors (10). Therefore, ANG 11-induced growth shown in VSMC
in vitro has been attributed to the ATl-receptor. The obvious
discrepancy between the effects of ANG II on VSMC and on
microvascular endothelial cells could be explained twofold.
First, angiotensin receptors on endothelial cells could be identi￾cal to those on VSMC (i.e., ATI) but coupled to intracellular
pathways different from those present in VSMC. Second, the
antiproliferative response to treatment with ANG II, as observed
in endothelial cells, could be due to the stimulation of an angio￾tensin receptor subtype different from AT1, for instance the
AT2-receptor. In addition, the antiproliferative effect of ANG
II could be a phenomenon occurring in serum-stimulated rat
cardiac microvascular endothelial cells but not a general feature
of CEC under stimulation with defined growth factors.
In the present study we investigated, first, whether ANG
II is antimitogenic for CEC stimulated to proliferate by the
administration of a defined growth factor and second, by which
angiotensin receptor subtype, ATl or AT2, the antimitogenic

effect of ANG II is mediated. Using different test systems,
[3H]thymidine incorporation, the MTT proliferation assay and
cell counts, we demonstrate that ANG II significantly inhibits
growth in bFGF-stimulated coronary endothelial cells and that
this effect is mediated by the AT2-receptor. Our results suggest
that the presence of the respective angiotensin receptor sub￾types, AT1 and AT2, on a given cell determines whether the
peptide exerts proliferative or antiproliferative actions.
Methods
Cell culture. VSMC were isolated from rat aortae by enzymatic digestion
as previously described (3). VSMC were cultured in medium containing
a 1:1 formulation of DME and HAM's F12 medium, supplemented with
10% FCS, L-glutamine ( 1 mM), penicillin ( 100 U/ml) and streptomycin
(100 jg/ml). Cells were harvested for passaging at subconfluence with
a trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA) solution. VSMC
identity and the purity of cultures were verified by immunohistochemical
analysis using a monoclonal antibody for smooth muscle a-actin.
Rat CEC were isolated as described by Piper et al. ( 11). In brief,
hearts from anesthetized and heparinized (intraperitoneal injection of
60 mg/ml per kg sodium pentobarbital and 5,000 I.U. sodium heparin)
male SHR weighing 180-250 g were excised and mounted via the
aorta to a Langendorff perfusion system. Nonrecirculating perfusion
was started immediately at a flow rate of 10 ml/min with a modified
Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 110 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 1.2
mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose and gassed with carbo￾gen (95% 02, 5% C02). After 5 min, perfusion was switched to recircu￾lating mode with Krebs-Henseleit solution supplemented with 136 U/
ml Collagenase (Worthington CLS II), 25 U/ml Dispase (grade I) and
5 U/ml trypsin. After 30 min of perfusion, atria were discarded, the
ventricles minced and again incubated in protease solution. The cell
homogenate was filtered through a nylon mesh (200 ,um) and centrifuged
at 25 g for 3 min. The supernatant was further dissociated for 30 min
with protease solution containing 4% bovine serum albumine (BSA)
and trypsin (5 U/ml). Cells were seeded on collagen A (containing
975% collagen type I and 3% type IV)-precoated dishes and cultured
in DME supplemented with 20% FCS, 50 jig/ml endothelial cell growth
supplement and 50 jg/ml heparin.
Cells were harvested for passaging at subconfluence with a trypsin￾EDTA (0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA) solution. Endothelial cells
were characterized by their cobblestone morphology and the presence
of the receptor for acetylated LDL (12). Purity of culture was verified
by the lack of staining with a monoclonal antibody for smooth muscle
a-actin to exclude pericyte contamination.
Cell cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humified atmosphere of
5% C02-95% air. VSMC were used from passages 10-28, CEC were
used exclusively up to the third passage.
[3H] Thymidine incorporation. Relative rates of DNA synthesis were
determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation following the method of
Glaser et al. ( 13 ) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were incubated
for 4 h with 1 uCi/well[methyl,1 ',2'-3H]thymidine in serum-free me￾dium. Cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline ( 124
mM Nacl, 2.8 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, and 0.5
mM MgCl2) and prefixed for 3 min with a formulation of 1:1 PBS/
fixative (70% ethanol/30% acetic acid). Cells were then fixed in fixa￾tive for 20 min at 37°C and for 10 min with 0.3 M perchloric acid,
followed by a thorough rinse with distilled water. The fixed cells were
incubated for 20 min in 100 til of a 0.25 M NaOH before an equal
volume of distilled water was added. The hydrolysate was than trans￾ferred to scintillation vials with 3 ml of scintillation fluid, and samples
were counted for 5 min in a beta-counter.
Proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was measured using the Cell￾Titer 96T' Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Merdeson, WI), which
uses cellular conversion of a tetrazolium salt into a blue formazan prod￾uct (MTT-test) ( 14). Absorbance was measured in an ELISA-reader at
570 and 620 nm (for reference) and was used as a parameter for cell
number. Additionally, cell number was directly determined using a
Coulter particle counter as described previously (15) with slight modi￾fications.
Experimental protocol. For [3H] thymidine incorporation and MTT￾test cells were seeded subconfluently on collagen A-precoated 96-
multiwell plates and for determination of cell number by cell count on
24-multiwell plates. Quiescence was achieved by serum deprivation in
standard culture medium supplemented with 1% FCS for at least 48 h.
The following experiments were then performed. Treatment of quiescent
cells with ANG II (10-' to 10-6 M, n = 10), with ANG II (10-7 M)
after pretreatment with the respective ATl- and AT2-receptor antago￾nists, losartan and PD 123177 (10-7 to 10-5 M, n = 8), and the AT2-
agonist, CGP 42112 (1O-8 to 10-6 M), or with the angiotensin receptor
ligands plus vehicle as controls (n = 8). [3H]Thymidine incorporation
and proliferation, respectively, were measured 40 to 48 h later as de￾scribed above. In a second set of experiments, proliferation of quiescent
cells was induced by the addition of 25 ng/ml bFGF for 24 h followed
by drug treatment of the cells as above. [3H] Thymidine incorporation
and proliferation were determined 24 h later (n = 10 for each group).
Angiotensin receptor binding studies. Cells at their second passage
were serum deprived for 48 h, harvested with trypsin/EDTA and imme￾diately washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Membrane particulate
was prepared according to a previously described method (16). Briefly,
harvested cells were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris, pH
7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 2 mM benzamidin and 0.01% bacitracin)
with a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged twice at
1,000 g for 10 min and the supernatants at 30,000 g for 45 min. The
resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA
at a concentration of 2 mg/ml and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein
content was determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Re￾agent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as
standard.
For competition binding experiments, membrane particulate was in￾cubated in 200 utl binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mM NaCl,
6.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA, 1 mM benzamidin, 0.01%
bacitracin and antipain, phosphoramidon, pepstatin A, bestatin, leupep￾tin and amastatin (all at 1 jig/ml) at a final concentration of 350 jsg/
ml for 90 min at 25°C in the presence of ['"I]Sar'lle8ANG II (0.25
nM) as a tracer and of losartan or CGP 42112 as respectively selective
ATI and AT2 competitors. The reaction was stopped with 3 ml of ice￾cold PBS, and bound ligand was separated from free by filtration through
glass-fiber filters (Whatman GF/F, Clifton, NJ) coated with 1% BSA.
Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 /AM ANG II
and was less than 10% of total binding. Specific binding was calculated
by subtracting non-specific from total binding. Degradation of [ 'I] Sar-
'Ile8 ANG Has measured by thin-layer chromatography was < 5%. Data
are the mean of three experiments analyzed with the EBDA-LIGAND
programme (17).
PCR analysis of ATI and AT72 expression. The mRNA expression
of the ATI and AT2 sequences was measured using RT-PCR assays.
The total RNA was extracted based on the protocol of Chirgwin et al.
(18). After first-strand synthesis of RNA using random hexamers as
described (19) cDNA was amplified using specific primers. For ampli￾fication of ATI, the antisense primer was GCCCTGTCCACAATA￾TCTGC (extending from base 1108 through base 1127) and the sense
primer TGTAAGATTGCTTICAGCCAGC (extending from base 581
through base 601) was used. For amplification of AT2, the antisense
primer was ACCACTGAGCATATTTCTCGGG (base 682 through
base 703) and the sense primer TGAGTCCGCATTTAACTGC (base
227 through base 245). The amplification protocol followed the proce￾dure originally described by Paul et al. (19). After amplification, se￾quences were blotted onto nylon membranes hybridized to full length
cDNA probes of ATI and AT2, respectively, as described (19). The
radioactive signals were then analyzed using a computer based imaging
system (Fuji BAS 2000).

Results
Effects of ANG II on [3H] thymidine uptake and proliferation.
ANG II was tested for its ability to stimulate the proliferation
of quiescent microvascular CEC and aortic VSMC or to influ￾ence the mitogenic activity of proliferating CEC after stimula￾tion with 25 ng/ml bFGF.
Application of ANG II ( 10-10 to 10-6 M) to quiescent CEC
did not exert any significant actions on [3H] thymidine uptake
or cell number (MTf-test: extinction 0.113+0.022 for vehicle￾treated CEC vs. 0.111±0.025 for ANG II (10-7 M)-treated
CEC). Fig. 1 b shows the respective data for [3H] thymidine
incorporation with an ANG II concentration of 0-7 M. In
contrast, a significant increase in [3H] thymidine incorporation
could be observed after treatment of quiescent VSMC with
ANG H at higher concentrations ( 10-7 to -10-6 M) (Fig. 1 a),
while cell number was not influenced (MTT-test: extinction
0.211±0.010 for vehicle-treated VSMC versus 0.200±0.003 for
ANG 11-treated VSMC). The ANG II-induced increase in [3H] -
thymidine uptake in VSMC was prevented by the specific ATI￾receptor antagonist, losartan, but was not influenced by the
specific AT2-receptor antagonist, PD 123177 (Fig. 1 a). In
quiescent CEC, losartan pretreatment slightly reduced [3H] -
thymidine uptake after ANG 11 (Fig. 1 b) while having no effect
when given alone (data not shown). In contrast, when quiescent
CEC were pretreated with PD 123177, [3H]thymidine uptake
was induced by ANG II (Fig. 1 b). This effect was abolished
when cells were pretreated with losartan in addition to PD
123177 (Fig. 1 b). Comparable results were obtained when cell
number was directly determined by a Coulter particle counter
(Table I).
Treatment of CEC with ANG II (10-9 to 10-6 M) 24 h
after stimulation with 25 ng/ml bFGF led to a dose-dependent
decrease in [3H]thymidin uptake compared with vehicle-treated
cells. This antimitogenic effect of ANG H was maximal at a
concentration of 10-6 M, when proliferation of CEC was inhib￾ited by more than 50% (Fig. 2, a and b) compared with vehicle￾treated controls. The decrease in [3H] thymidine incorporation
was accompanied by a similar decrease in conversion of MIT
and cell number (Table I) compared with vehicle-treated prolif￾4500

(10-7 M) vs. 0.152+0.005 in controls; P < 0.01).
To characterize the angiotensin receptor subtype involved
in the antimitogenic action of ANG II, we examined the influ￾ence of ANG II (10-7 M) on endothelial cell [3H] thymidine
incorporation in the presence of losartan and PD 123177 (both
i0-7 to 10-5 M). Treatment of the cells with the angiotensin
receptor antagonists plus vehicle served as control.
The antimitogenic actions of ANG II on bFGF-stimulated
CEC were not influenced by losartan. In contrast, pretreatment
of the cells with PD 123177 totally prevented the ANG II￾induced antiproliferation (Fig. 2, b and c and Table I). Neither
of the two angiotensin receptor antagonists had an intrinsic
effect on proliferating CEC (data not shown).
The AT2 agonist, CGP 42112, was found to mimic the
antiproliferative effect of ANG I, but only at significantly higher
concentrations (10-6 M). At lower concentrations, this com￾pound competed for this effect of ANG II (Fig. 3).
Angiotensin receptor subtypes expressed by CEC and
VSMC. VSMC in culture have been shown previously to express
only ATI receptors (10, 21, 25). The subtypes of ANG II
receptors expressed by CEC in culture at early passages (-s 3)
were identified by radioligand binding experiments using the
nonselective ANG II antagonist, [125] Sar'Ile8 ANG II, as a

fmol/mg protein and a Ki for ANG II of 0.3±0.07 nM (n =
3). The competition binding experiments performed with losar￾tan and CGP 42112 yielded complex curves suggesting the
presence of two classes of binding sites (Fig. 4). Computer￾assisted analysis of the data (after subtraction of nonspecific
binding) using a non linear curve fitting programm (17) con￾firmed the presence of two classes of binding sites with Ki
values of respectively 40 nM and 8.5 ,O.M for losartan and 0.24
nM and 1.7 1tM for CGP 42112. These values are in agreement
with the previously reported affinities of these compounds for
ATI and AT2 receptors in other tissues and cultured cells (10,
16, 26, 28, 34, 35, 36), thus indicating the expression of both
receptor subtypes in culture. The ratio of ATi/AT2 receptors
was calculated to be 80%/20%±5%.
Analysis of ATJ- and Af2-receptor mRNA expression in
CEC. Specific mRNA transcripts for both ANG 11 receptor sub￾types, ATI and AT2, could be detected in CEC up to the third
cell passage by PCR analysis. All PCR products were found to
be of the predicted size on agarose gels. The specificity of
the PCR reaction was tested by restriction enzyme analysis of
amplified products which resulted in fragments of correct size
(data not shown) as well as by hybridization of the PCR prod￾ucts to full length cDNA probes of ATI and AT2 (Fig. 5).
Discussion
In preliminary studies we have reported that ANG 11 can inhibit
the proliferation of coronary endothelial cells in vitro (8, 9).
The present study confirms and extends our previous findings
by demonstrating that distinct growth modulating actions of
ANG 11 are coupled to different angiotensin receptor subtypes.
Several investigators have shown that ANG II is a growth
promoting factor for VSMC ( 1-5, 20, 21 ) and that this effect
is mediated by the ATi-receptor (22). The results of the present
study using VSMC isolated from the rat aorta confirm the find￾ings of Geisterfer et al. (3) and Berk et al. (22). ANG II
treatment engendered hypertrophy but not hyperplasia in aortic
VSMC, since ANG II induced the synthesis of DNA (as re￾flected by the uptake of [3H] thymidine) but did not lead to an
increased cell number. Thus far, an ANG 11-induced hyperplasia
has only been reported for aortic VSMC originating from SHR
or for VSMC isolated from mesenteric arteries (4, 5, 24).
The growth responses of VSMC to ANG II vary depending
on the target VSMC, and the mechanisms leading to differential
growth responses are still controversial. Dzau et al. (25) pro￾posed that ANG II represents a bifunctional growth factor for
VSMC by simultaneously stimulating proliferative and antipro￾liferative pathways that appear to be mediated by the activation
of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and transforming
growth factor (TGF-f31) They reported that the mitogenic effect
of ANG II was offset by the concomitant activation of TGF-,f1
which prevented proliferation. On the other hand, Stouffer and
Owens (24) claimed that the ANG 11-induced mitogenesis in
VSMC derived from SHR was dependent on an autocrine pro￾duction of TGF-613, potentiating the mitogenic properties of
ANG II in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or
PDGF-BB. The discrepancies between these studies concerning
the responses of VSMC to ANG 11 could be due to the experi￾mental conditions, e.g., the presence or absence of distinct
growth factors such as EGF, PDGF, bFGF, or serum.
VSMC in culture express only ATI- but no AT2-receptors
(10, 16, 20, 26). Thus, the trophic effects of ANG 11 causing
hyperplasia or hypertrophy can only be ascribed to the AT1-
receptor. Accordingly, in our study, the ATi-receptor antago￾nist, losartan, blocked the hypertrophic actions of ANG 11 in
VSMC while the AT2-receptor antagonist, PD 123177, was
ineffective. In contrast to VSMC, ANG II given alone exerted
no growth promoting actions in quiescent endothelial cells. In￾terestingly, treatment of quiescent CEC with losartan in combi￾nation with ANG II reduced 3H-thymidine uptake below basal
levels of vehicle-treated, serum-deprived cells while losartan
by itself had no effect. Since vehicle-treated cells revealed a
[3H]thymidine uptake of about 10.000 counts per minute, it is
conceivable that complete quiescence of the cells was not
achieved by partial serum deprivation with DME + 1% FCS.
Therefore, this effect could be explained by the stimulation of
AT2-receptors which were unmasked by blockade of the AT1-
receptors.
When quiescent CEC were pretreated with the AT2-receptor
antagonist, PD 123177, a mitogenic action of ANG II could
also be demonstrated in endothelial cells. Pretreatment with
losartan in addition to PD 123177 abolished this effect. The
endothelial cells used in this study express the AT1- as well as
the AT2-receptor. Thus, the AT2-receptor blockade obviously
unmasked the growth-promoting effect of the ATI-receptor in
quiescent endothelial cells. Together, these findings in quiescent
VSMC and CEC suggest that ANG II can only exert a mitogenic
action through the ATI-receptor when the AT2-receptor is ei￾ther absent (as in cultured VSMC) or inactivated (as observed
after pretreatment with PD 123177 in CEC).

ATl-antagonist, losartan ( 1i0- M), was ineffective, while the AT2-

ANG II significantly inhibited growth of bFGF-stimulated
proliferating endothelial cells in both assay systems used. Pre￾treatment of CEC with the AT2-antagonist, PD 123177, but
not with the ATL-antagonist, losartan, prevented the ANG II￾induced endothelial antiproliferation indicating that this effect
is mediated by the AT2-receptor subtype.
These findings are corrobated by the observations concern￾ing the effect of the AT2 selective analog, CGP 42112. Whereas
the antagonistic properties observed at low concentrations may
appear to be in contradiction with its agonistic properties at
higher concentrations, these data are in agreement with its par￾tial agonistic properties reported recently in other systems (27-

30). Since this compound has the same affinity as ANG II for
the AT2 receptor, but a lower intrinsic activity, it will compete
with ANG II and inhibit its effect to a certain extent. At higher
concentrations, the intrinsic activity appears to be sufficient to
achieve the same final response as ANG II.
The question remains, as to how AT2-receptor stimulation
can exert an antimitogenic action on proliferating endothelial
cells in the presence of the ATI-receptor. It is conceivable that
the growth-promoting ATI effect of ANG II is inoperative in
cells stimulated to proliferation by a potent growth factor such
as bFGF. On the other hand, it is also possible that the AT2-
mediated antimitogenic effect dominates by a yet unknown
mechanism over the growth-promoting actions of the ATI-re￾ceptor.

Our present findings are in apparent contrast to previous
observations that ANG II has angiogenic properties in vivo (31,
32). Fernandez et al. (31) reported that ANG II, when im￾planted in the rabbit cornea, induced formation of new vessels.
However, since the distribution of angiotensin receptors in the
rabbit cornea may differ from that in CEC, the angiogenic effect
of ANG II may be explained by stimulation of ATi-receptors
in the absence of the AT2-receptor. Recently, Le Noble et al.
(32) reported that ANG II induced angiogenesis in the chick
chorioallantoic membrane. They postulated an involvement of
a novel ANG II receptor subtype or the AT2-receptor in this
effect. In their study, the AT2-ligand, CGP 42112, at a concen￾tration of 2 x 10-6 M blocked the ANG II-induced angiogenesis
while losartan as well as the nonpeptidergic AT2-antagonist,
PD 123319, failed to significantly inhibit the angiogenic effect
of ANG II. The observed effect of ANG II and its inhibition
by CGP 42112 could be specific for the chick chorioallantoic
membrane, since avian (33) and amphibian (34) ANG II recep￾tors have been shown to differ from those in mammalian tissues.
On the other hand, since a concentration of 2 X 10-6 M of
CGP 42112A is agonistic for the AT2-receptor (see references
cited above and this study) as well as antagonistic for the AT1-
receptor (28), the inhibition of ANG II-induced angiogenesis
in the chick chorioallantoic membrane by this compound is
difficult to interpret.
Little is known as of this writing on the function of the
AT2-receptor. Although the AT2-receptor has recently been
cloned (35, 36) its structure and signal transduction pathway
are still far from being completely understood. The rat AT2-
receptor cDNA encodes for a 363-amino acid protein that has
a seven transmembrane domain topology and a homology of
32-34% in its amino acid sequence to the ATI-receptor. How￾ever, it is still controversial whether it is coupled to G-proteins,
and how it signals. Kambayashi et al. (35) reported that the rat
AT2-receptor (expression cloned from a rat pheochromocytoma
cell line) mediates an inhibition of a phosphotyrosine phospha￾tase in COS-7-cells (stably expressing the rat AT2-receptor).
This effect is dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive, G-protein
coupled mechanism. On the other hand, Mukoyama et al. (36)
reported that the rat AT2-receptor shares a seven transmem￾brane domain topology which may belong to a unique class of
seven transmembrane receptors for which G-protein coupling
has not been demonstrated. In their studies, stimulation of the
cloned AT2-receptor (transiently expressed in COS-7-cells)
failed to increase 1P3 or intracellular calcium, and no apparent
effects on cAMP and cGMP levels and phosphotyrosine phos￾phatase activity could be observed. The authors speculated that
a highly conserved motif in the third intracellular loop distin￾guishes this class of receptors from the classical G-protein￾coupled receptors.
In NG 108-15 cells, which constitutively express AT2 recep￾tors, Buisson et al. (37) have shown that AT2 receptor stimula￾tion results in the inhibition of T-type calcium channels through
an as yet undefined pathway. In another cell line, which also
only expresses AT2 receptors, Bottari and collegues reported
that ANG H stimulates a membrane associated phosphotyrosine
phosphatase (PTP) activity (29) and inhibits ANP-sensitive
particulate guanylate cyclase (30, 38). Both effects are G-Pro￾tein independent ( 16, 29), and the inhibition of particulate gua￾nylate cyclase is abolished by blockade of PTP activity, thus
suggesting that both responses are linked and that PTP activa￾tion occurs upstream from particulate guanylate cyclase inhibi￾tion (30). The PTP involved appears to have several substrates
which, however, still have to be further characterized (29).
These findings are compatible with our data since it has
been shown that sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phospho￾tyrosine phosphatases, may induce angiogenesis in vivo (39).
It is conceivable that after stimulation of a phosphotyrosine
phosphatase the opposite, i.e., a decreased proliferation, may
occur. This may be particularly pertinent with regard to the
inhibition of the mitogenic effect of bFGF which is known to
involve multiple tyrosine phosphorilations.
Results from binding studies have demonstrated that the
appearance of AT2-receptors is subjected to significant changes
during development and differentiation. For instance, in rats the
proportion of ATI- and AT2-receptors in most tissues changes
dramatically during the postnatal period (40, 41). While in fetal
tissues AT2-receptors are by far dominating, in adult animals
it is the AT1-receptor. In addition, an increased expression of
AT2-receptors has been described in pathophysiological condi￾tions such as vascular neointima proliferation (42) or left ven￾tricular hypertrophy due to aortic banding (43).
The observation of transient expression of the AT2-receptor
during development together with that of an AT2-induced stim￾ulation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity suggest that
this receptor subtype is involved in the control of cell prolifera￾tion and differentiation. In view of the above mentioned and
our present findings, one could speculate that a major function
of the AT2-receptor is to tune down excessive proliferative
actions of growth factors including those of ANG II via the
ATi-receptor. This growth modulatory action of the AT2-recep￾tor may be of particular importance during development or in
pathophysiological situations involving remodelling and tissue
repair.
