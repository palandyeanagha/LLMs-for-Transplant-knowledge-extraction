INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, a large-scale infectious pneumonia 
of unknown origin broke out in Wuhan, China. Chinese 
scientists isolated a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, 
causing the pneumonia on Jan 7, 2020 [1, 2]. And WHO 
named it Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 
February 2020 [3]. Since March, justifying the previous 
data model [4], COVID-19 has raged across world. Up 
to Jun 3, 2020, there have been more than 6.4 million 
diagnosed cases in more than 200 countries, with a 
mortality rate of about 6% [5].
The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from 
mild to critical [6]. A lot of observational studies have 
described the clinical characteristics of patients with 
COVID-19 in Wuhan [7–10], but studies outside 
Wuhan have rarely been reported. Because of the virus 
variation, the clinical characteristics of the patients in 
Wuhan and outside Wuhan maybe different. In this 
study, we aimed to investigate patients with COVID-19 
in Guangzhou to find their clinical characteristics and 
the risk factors for severe cases. Monitoring these 
factors can help clinicians identify severe patients early 
and take subsequent interventions to reduce their illness.

ABSTRACT
Background: SARS-CoV-2 has raged around the world since March, 2020. We aim to describe the clinical
characteristics and risk factors of severe patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou.
Results: The severity and mortality of COVID-19 was 10.4% and 0.3% respectively. And each 1-year increase in
age (OR, 1.057; 95% CI, 1.018-1.098; P=0.004), Wuhan exposure history greater than 2 weeks (OR, 2.765; 95%
CI, 1.040-7.355; P=0.042), diarrhea (OR, 24.349; 95% CI, 3.580-165.609; P=0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR,
6.966; 95% CI, 1.310-37.058; P = 0.023), myoglobin higher than 106 μg/L (OR, 8.910; 95% CI, 1.225-64.816;
P=0.031), white blood cell higher than 10×109
/L (OR, 5.776; 95% CI, 1.052-31.722; P=0.044), and C-reactive
protein higher than 10 mg/L (OR, 5.362; 95% CI, 1.631-17.626; P=0.006) were risk factors for severe cases.
Conclusion: Older age, Wuhan exposure history, diarrhea, chronic kidney disease, elevated myoglobin, elevated
white blood cell and C-reactive protein were independent risk factors for severe patients with COVID-19 in
Guangzhou.
Methods: We included 288 adult patients with COVID-19 and compared the data between severe and
non-severe group. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to explore risk factors of
severe cases.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Among the 288 patients, 30 cases were in severe group 
and only 1 case died by the end of the study. Thus, the 
severity and mortality were 10.4% and 0.3% 
respectively. The median age of all patients was 48.5 
years (IQR 34.3-62), of which women accounted for 
54.5% (Table 1). 134 (46.5%) patients had 
comorbidities, of which cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
(85, 29.5%) was the most common one, followed by 
hypertension (84, 29.2%), diabetes (24, 8.3%) (Table 
1). 132 patients (45.8%) had a history of exposure to 
Wuhan 2 weeks before onset (Table 1). The most 
common symptoms on admission were fever (201, 
69.8%) and cough (163, 56.6%), followed by sputum 
(58, 20.1%), fatigue (43, 14.9%), and myalgia (35, 
12.2%) (Table 1).
Laboratory and radiological findings
216 (75%) patients had white blood cells (WBC) in 
normal range and lymphopenia occurred in 91 (31.6%) 
patients (Table 2). Compared with non-severe patients, 
severe patients had significantly reduced serum 
hemoglobin, platelet and myoglobin, as well as 
significantly increased WBC, alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, 
creatine kinase, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin 
(PCT), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin I 
(Table 2). 31 (10.8%) patients had unilateral pneumonia, 
and all of them were non-severe patients; 241 (83.7%) 
patients had bilateral pneumonia, of which 29 (96.7%) 
were severe patients (Table 2). Their chest CTs showed 
varying degrees of patchy ground-glass opacity, with 
lung lesion area of severe patients usually larger than 
that of non-severe patients (Figure 1).
Treatments and outcomes
244 (84.7%) patients received antibiotics, and 233 
(80.9%) patients received antiviral drugs (oseltamivir / 
ribavirin; Table 3). There was a significant difference in 
the use of glucocorticoids and vasoactive drugs between 
non-severe and severe patients (Table 3). Five patients 
were treated with continuous renal replacement therapy 
(CRRT) and four patients were treated with 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and 
they were all severe patients (Table 3). 98.9% of the 
non-severe patients did not take oxygen or took normal￾flux oxygen, while 43.3% of the severe patients took 
high-flux oxygen (Table 3). Eight patients were tracheal 
intubated and they were all severe patients (Table 3). 
Severe patients had a significant increase in use of non￾invasive mechanical ventilation than non-severe 
patients (Table 3). Compared with non-severe patients, 
severe patients were more likely to be transferred to the 
intensive care unit (ICU), and suffer from ARDS, acute 
kidney injury and acute cardiac injury (Table 3).
Univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors 
of severe cases
In univariate logistic regression analysis, we found that 
older patients with hypertension, chronic kidney disease
(CKD), and a history of exposure in Wuhan were more 
likely to develop severe disease (Table 4). In addition, 
fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, WBC, CRP, 
lymphocytes, COPD, CVD, hemoglobin, ALT, AST, 
myoglobin, creatinine, creatine kinase, PCT, BNP and 
TNI were also related with severe cases (Table 4).
The multivariable logistic regression model was 
constructed using all variables of significant statistical 
differences in univariate logistic regression analysis. 
We found that each 1-year increase in age (OR, 1.057; 
95% CI, 1.018-1.098; P=0.004), Wuhan exposure 
history greater than 2 weeks (OR, 2.765; 95% CI, 
1.040-7.355; P=0.042), CKD (OR, 6.966; 95% CI, 
1.310-37.058; P = 0.023), diarrhea (OR, 24.349; 95% 
CI, 3.580-165.609; P=0.001), Myoglobin higher than
106 μg/L (OR, 8.910; 95% CI, 1.225-64.816; P=0.031), 
WBC higher than 10×109/L (OR, 5.776; 95% CI, 1.052-
31.722; P=0.044), and CRP higher than 10 mg/L (OR, 
5.362; 95% CI, 1.631-17.626; P=0.006) were 
independent risk factors for severe cases (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Of the 288 patients in our database, only one case 
(0.3%) died, while the early mortality rate in Wuhan 
was as high as 28.3% [3]. And the severity of COVID￾19 in Guangzhou is 10.4%, which was far less than that 
in early Wuhan of 31.7% [11].
It was interesting to note Guangzhou patients with 
Wuhan exposure history had a higher risk of becoming 
severe cases (Table 4). Earlier reports reported that 
some patients had SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments 
missing, suggesting that their virulence gradually 
weakened [12]. And an article reported that COVID-19 
patients in Zhejiang Province had relatively mild 
symptoms compared with Wuhan [13]. Later, it was 
reported that SARS-CoV-2 has genomic diversity. It 
mutated through replication and may evolve under the 
pressure of immune surveillance in human body, with 
its virulence, infectivity and transmission being affected 
[14]. Therefore, the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 may 
increase or decrease during transmission, and certain 
populations in different regions may also have a 
screening effect on it, resulting in different disease

degrees and influencing factors of COVID-19 in 
different regions.
According to previous reports, older age was an 
important independent predictor of SARS and MERS 
mortality [15, 16]. Previous studies have confirmed 
increased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in old 
patients [3, 7, 17]. A recent study comparing the clinical 
characteristics and results of COVID-19 patients of 
different ages showed that the symptoms of elderly 
patients were more atypical, with more comorbidities, 
secondary infection, organ injuries, immunodeficiency 
and a higher risk of critical illness [18]. Many 
comorbidities in the elderly such as hypertension, 
diabetes and CKD were treated with ACE inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers, which would 
upregulate the ACE2 receptor, thereby increasing the 
risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk of disease 
[19]. In our study cohort, age was also one of the risk 
factors for severe patients (Table 4). Therefore, it’s very 
important for old patients to have early diagnosis and 
treat systemic comorbidities carefully.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be detected in stool 
samples from patients [20], and a study of a family 
cluster have reported two COVID-19 patients who had 
only diarrhea symptom [9]. Besides diarrhea, some 
patients also had other gastrointestinal symptoms such 
as vomiting and abdominal pain [21]. Our analysis 
showed that diarrhea was a risk factor for severe cases 
(Table 4), which suggested that beside of damaging the 
respiratory system, the virus may also have a certain 
function on the digestive system. This finding may be 
related to the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor 
ACE2 in both the epithelial cells of lungs and digestive 
tract [21, 22]. Given the small number of diarrhea cases 
Figure 1. Chest CTs of two representative cases. Case 1 (non-severe): Chest CT on Feb 24 (A) showed multiple patchy ground-glass 
opacity in both lungs, with unclear borders and uneven density. Chest CT on Feb 28 (B) showed better status, and some lesions were slightly 
absorbed than before. Case 2 (severe): Chest CT on Jan 29 (C) showed the texture of both lungs was slightly increased, and both lungs were 
scattered in patchy shadows, whose edges were blurred. Chest CT on Feb 11 (D) showed the scope of the bilateral lung lesions was enlarged, 
the density was increased, and the local consolidation and bronchial signs were seen. Chest CT on Mar 4 (E) showed improved status, and 
both lung lesions were significantly less than before.

*P values indicate differences between Severe and Non-severe patients. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
(11, 3.8%) (Table 1), SARS-CoV-2-induced digestive 
system damage may also be related to other physical 
factors of these patients, which deserves further study.
Previous studies have reported that COVID-19 non￾survivors had more neutrophil counts than survivors, 
which may be related to cytokine storms caused by 
virus invasion [7, 11]. Our analysis found that elevated 
WBC and CRP were risk factors for severe cases (Table 
4). Like neutrophils, WBC and CRP are also indicators 
of inflammatory status in the body. When they elevated, 
there may be a cytokine storm caused by virus invasion 
in the body, which may cause severe inflammation in 
lungs and other organs, and aggravate the disease. 
Therefore, paying close attention to changes in WBC, 
CRP and making timely correction can effectively 
reduce the number of severe cases and deaths.
In our study, myoglobin, creatine kinase, BNP, and 
TNI were increased in severe patients compared to 
non-severe patients (Table 2), and myoglobin was a 
risk factor for severe patients, which indicated that 
COVID-19 may be related to acute cardiac injury. 
ACE2 is also expressed in heart [23], and SARS-CoV 
has been shown in animal models to directly mediate 
myocardial inflammation and damage by down￾regulating myocardial ACE2 and lead to poor cardiac 
prognosis [24]. A meta-analysis involving 4189 
patients showed that more severe COVID-19 was 
associated with increased troponin, creatine kinase, 
myoglobin, and NT-proBNP [25]. Myoglobin was also 
included in the COVID-19 severity score table as one 
of the biomarkers [26]. The severity of COVID-19 
may be related to acute cardiac injury, which prompts 
us to effectively monitor heart condition to prevent

www.aging-us.com 15737 AGING
COVID-19 patients from myocarditis and avoid poor 
cardiac prognosis.
Many studies have reported that comorbidities were 
major risk factors for increasing COVID mortality and 
poor prognosis [7, 8], and CKD was one of them. Due 
to older age, previous comorbidities, impaired immune 
system, and regular visits to crowded outpatient dialysis 
centers, CKD patients have increase susceptibility to 
SARS-COV-2 [27]. On one hand, the above factors 
have greatly reduced the ability of CKD patients to 
overcome the virus and may lead to severe disease or 
even death. On the other hand, SARS-COV-2 can 
directly damage kidney by combine with ACE2 [28], 
and cause kidney inflammation and acute kidney injury 
[13, 29], which was consistent with the increase 
creatinine level of severe patients in our study. AKI 
could further aggravate CKD as well as worsening the 
patients’ whole conditions, leading patients to develop 
severe illness.
The study has several limitations. First, the sample size 
of our study cohort was relatively small including only 
288 patients from a single center. Due to the exploratory 
nature of the study, which was not driven by formal 
hypotheses, we did not estimate the sample size, but 
included as many cases as possible. Second, this study 
lacked laboratory data such as serum cytokines and 
chemokines, so that we cannot evaluate the 
inflammation levels and cytokine storms of these 
patients. Third, this was a retrospective study. The data 
in this study was only a preliminary assessment of 
clinical characteristics and risk factors of COVID-19 
severe patients. Further researches are still needed.
In conclusion, our research showed that the severity and 
mortality of COVID-19 in Guangzhou were much lower 
than those in early Wuhan. The risk factors for severe 
cases of COVID-19 in Guangzhou included older age, 
Wuhan exposure history greater than 2 weeks, diarrhea, 
elevated Myoglobin, elevated WBC and CRP, and 
CKD. Investigating and monitoring these factors can 
help clinicians identify patients with poor prognosis at 
an early stage, and take proactive interventions to 
benefit patients and reduce severity and mortality. It 
also provided significant experience and reference for 
countries around the world to fight against COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and participants
This single-center, retrospective cohort study was 
conducted at Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital 
(Guangzhou, China), which was the designated hospital 
to treat patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou. From 
Jan 15, 2020 to Mar 10, 2020, we recruited 288 adult
patients with COVID-19 (the total number was 292, 
including 4 underage patients).
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital, and informed 
consent was obtained from all patients enrolled.
Definitions
According to the Chinese diagnosis and treatment 
guideline for COVID-19 (trial version 7.0) [6], 288 
patients were divided into non-severe group (258 cases), 
including light and general patients, and severe group 
(30 cases), including severe and critical patients. A case 
was defined as severe if it met any of the following: (1) 
shortness of breath, respiratory rate ≥ 30 times / minute; 
(2) blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93% at rest; (3) 
oxygenation index (PaO2 / FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg; (4) 
pulmonary infiltrates > 50% of the lung lesions within 
24-48 hours; (5) respiratory failure, requiring 
mechanical ventilation; (6) shock; (7) combine with 
multiple organ dysfunction, needing ICU monitoring 
treatment. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 
(ARDS) was defined according to WHO’s guidance for 
COVID-19 [30]. Acute renal injury (ARI) was 
determined from serum creatinine [31]. Acute cardiac 
injury (ACI) was determined based on the serum 
concentration of troponin I (TNI) [11]. The reference 
ranges of all laboratory inspection indicators were 
measured in the laboratory of Guangzhou Eighth 
People’s Hospital.
Data collection
This study reviewed the clinical electronic medical 
records, nursing records, laboratory tests and 
radiological findings of 288 adult patients with COVID￾19, who were confirmed by nucleic acid testing. And 
we extracted epidemiology, demographics, clinical 
manifestations, laboratory data, chest radiography 
findings, treatment and outcome data for statistical 
analysis and research.
Statistical analysis
The purpose of this study was to analyze the risk factors 
of severe patients by comparing severe group and non￾severe group in terms of their clinical data. Therefore, 
no formal assumptions were used to facilitate the 
calculation of the sample size, and we included the 
largest number of patients who met the inclusion 
criteria.
We represented continuous variables as median and 
interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables as 

www.aging-us.com 15738 AGING
frequency (N) and percentage (%). We assessed 
differences between severe group and non-severe group
using two-sample t test or the Mann-Whitney U test
depending on parametric or nonparametric data for 
continuous variables, and χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test 
for categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression models were used to explore the risk 
factors for severe cases.
A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. All data were statistically analyzed using 
SPSS software (version 25).
