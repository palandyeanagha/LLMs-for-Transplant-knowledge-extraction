Abstract
Background: Food allergy has been reported increasingly around the world during the past several decades.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common herpesvirus with high infection rate, is now suspected to be a risk or protective factor
in food allergy. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible role of EBV infection in IgE-mediated food allergy.
Methods: 34 patients with an egg allergy and 34 healthy controls participated in this study. Egg allergy was confirmed
by open-food challenge. Serum anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA), anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) IgG and
egg specific (yolk and white)-IgE levels were evaluated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At the same
time, EBV DNA as well as viral miRNAs in these samples was quantified by real-time PCR.
Results: The results showed that serum anti EBNA-1 IgG and two viral miRNAs (miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7) were
highly expressed in patients with egg allergy compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05, < 0.001 and < 0.01,
respectively). Moreover, the expressions of anti EBNA-1 specific IgG, miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7 positively correlated
with the level of egg-specific IgE (p < 0.05, < 0.01 and < 0.01, respectively). The differences in anti VCA IgG
concentration and EBV DNA copy number between the allergy patients and control individuals were not statistically
significant.
Conclusions: The high expression of EBV-specific antibody and miRNAs indicated that EBV infection might play a
promoting role in IgE-mediated egg food allergy, and viral miRNAs-related immunomodulatory pathway was likely
involved in this allergy process.

Background
Food allergy (FA) refers to a series of adverse reactions
to foods that are immunologically mediated. Over the
past several decades, the prevalence of FA has markedly
increased in developed countries, and become an im￾portant public health problem [1,2]. Because there is no
effective treatment to prevent or ease allergy reactions
currently, identification of possible risk factors for FA is
of great clinical importance.
The occurrence of FA is based on the disorder of a
complex immunoregulatory network, including host- or
antigen-specific properties, dietary, as well as other en￾vironmental factors. The etiology of FA has not been
completely elucidated yet, except that children with
allergic parents more often get allergy; however, Epstein￾Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been implicated in influ￾encing IgE-mediated sensitization in early childhood.
Some studies have suggested a food allergy-promoting
effect [3], whereas others showed an age dependent
allergy-protective role of EBV: only the children who
acquired EBV infection before two years of age can
benefit from it [4,5]. Further investigations are needed to
verify the precise role of EBV infection in food allergic
disorders. Moreover, most studies published so far have
focused on early EBV infection in infants or children,
while the possible relationship between EBV infection
and adult food allergy is rarely reported.
Therefore, we propose to conduct an investigation on
the relationship between EBV infection and FA. Consid￾ering egg protein is one of the most common food aller￾gens around the world [6,7], current study recruited
patients with egg specific FA. EBV-specific antibodies,

viral DNA and viral microRNAs (miRNAs) are included
in this study. EBV viral miRNAs are a set of miRNAs
derived from EBV genome. The expression of these
miRNAs is often associated with various disease states
triggered by viral infections [8,9]. Assessing the role of
these miRNAs in the pathophysiology and their possible
application as biomarkers for different phases of infec￾tion is a focus of current researches. Here we used sero￾logical as well as molecular methods to evaluate the
association of EBV infection and its possible role in FA.
The aim of this study is to explore the possible correl￾ation between EBV infection and IgE-mediated egg-spe￾cific food allergy in Chinese adults.
Results
EBV infection in the allergic and controls
The concentrations of anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) and
anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) specific IgG
antibodies are summarized as median (interquartile range)
(Figure 1A and Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1).
The mean level of anti EBNA-1 IgG was 83.13 RU/mL
(59.10 to 103.38 RU/mL, interquartile range) in controls
and 110.96 RU/mL (71.13 to 132.34 RU/mL) in allergic
groups. Meanwhile, the concentration of anti VCA IgG
was 86.80 RU/mL (53.97 to 122.05 RU/mL) in controls
and 96.98 RU/mL (63.90 to 128.41 RU/mL) in allergic
groups. Compared with the healthy control group, the al￾lergic group showed a higher level of anti EBNA-1 IgG
(p < 0.05). However, such a difference was not observed
in anti VCA IgG between the two groups (p = 0.681).
Notably, no anti-VCA IgM positive sample was identi￾fied in both allergic and healthy control group, indicat￾ing the past infection of EBV in all participators.
Serum DNA samples from 34 allergic patients and 34
controls were analyzed using commercial real-time
quantitative PCR system. Each of the two groups had
one EBV DNA positive sample, but the viral loads were
relatively low. The positive sample from the allergic
group had a DNA concentration of 5.6×103 copies/mL,
while that from the control group was 5.6×104 copies/
mL. All serum DNA samples (patients and controls)
were amplifiable using β-actin PCR, to confirm the qual￾ity of the serum-extracted DNA.
Samples with anti EBNA-1 IgG and/or anti VCA IgG
seropositivity (≥ 22 RU/mL and ≥ 22 RU/mL, respect￾ively), or with EBV DNA positivity, were considered to
have been infected with EBV [10]. Data for the current
study showed that all the allergic patients and the
healthy controls were infected.
Serum EBV viral miRNA
Three EBV coding viral miRNAs, including miR-BHRF1-1,
miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7, were chosen to evaluate
the EBV infection in this study. After PCR amplification,
melting curve analysis was done to ensure the specifi￾city of test. It showed that miR-BART1-5p had a higher
level in the allergic group compared with the control
group (p < 0.001, 95% CI 1.004-2.517). The expression
of miR-BART7 was similar to that of miR-BART1-5p,
increasing significantly in allergic group (p < 0.01, 95%
CI 0.520-1.979). In this study, the mean concentration of
three viral miRNAs was expressed as a -fold change com￾pared with the control group. Therefore the concentration
of miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7 increased 3.39 and
2.35-fold in allergic patients compared with healthy indivi￾duals, respectively. Whereas the miR-BHRF1-1 level
only had a mild change between these two groups (1.39-
fold increase) and no significant difference was observed
(p = 0.266) (Figure 2A and Table 1).
Correlation analysis between EBV infection and egg￾specific IgE
Among 34 patients participated this study, linear regres￾sion analysis showed that the anti EBNA-1 specific IgG
level was correlated with the egg-specific IgE concentra￾tion (p < 0.05, 95% CI 0.168-2.391, R2 = 0.147; p < 0.01,
95% CI 0.715-2.843, R2 = 0.328 (adjusted for gender))
(Figure 1B and Table 2). Moreover, the positive correla￾tionships between EBV specific miR-BART1-5p or miR￾BART7 expression and the level of egg-specific IgE were
also proved in current study (p < 0.01, 95% CI 0.068-
0.302, R2 = 0.246 and p < 0.01, 95% CI 0.049-0.311, R2 =
0.196, respectively) (Figure 2C, D and Table 2). However,
other EBV infection markers, including anti VCA IgG
and viral miR-BHRF1-1 showed no significant up or
down tendency in allergic patients with different specific
IgE levels.
Discussion
EBV is a large DNA virus of γ herpes subfamily. It infects
around 98% of the world’s population [11]. It is well
known that EBV exerts a wide range of immune modulat￾ing effects, inhibition of apoptosis, and disturbance of the
anti-EBV effects of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) within B cells.
Furthermore, it also plays an important role in the produc￾tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 [12]. How￾ever, the pathogenic influence of EBV in allergic disorders,
such as FA, remains unclear. TH1/TH2 immune response
may play a central role in EBV related food allergy reac￾tion. TH1 cytokines induce major histocompatibility com￾plex molecules and activate T cells. Alternatively, TH2
cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10, activate B cells
and stimulate antibody production. After the EBV infec￾tion, TH2 cells can be induced to express IL-10 and its
analogue, which stimulate B-cell proliferation and poly￾clonal antibody production [13,14]. And indeed, an
increased level of anti EBNA-1 IgG in egg-specific food

allergic patient was proved in current study. Because
EBNA-1 is the only viral protein expressed during the first
latency phase and VCA is a major capsid antigen only
involved in lytic cycle [15], our result shows a higher sero￾logical reactivity against EBNA-1 in FA patients, therefore
indicates that the reactivation of latent EBV infection may
be a promoting factor in allergy reaction. It is noteworthy
that Nilsson C et al. and Saghafian-Hedengren S et al.
indicated that the acquisition of EBV infection in the first
two years of life may reduce the risk of food allergen￾specific IgE sensitization in childhood [5,6]. The discrep￾ancy may due to the different age and race of participators,
early or past latent infection, the diversity in the medical
history, and the accuracy of detection methods. Consider￾ing that the study population and EBV infection status are
two of the most significant differences between ours and
the former studies, it will be interesting to know whether
EBV plays a dual role in patients with FA: protecting the
infants while harming the adults.
Another important finding in this study is the
increased concentration of EBV viral miR-BART1-5p
and miR-BART7 in patients with egg FA, which indi￾cated that there might be an association between EBV
and FA on molecular level. EBV has been shown to en￾code at least 40 miRNAs, located in two regions of EBV
genome [16]: the BHRF1 miRNAs locate immediately
upstream and downstream of the BHRF1 open reading
frame, while the BART miRNAs lie within the intronic
regions of the BARTs. In this study, we observed a sig￾nificant increase of miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7
levels in patients with FA. Previous study has reported
that the expression of the BART miRNA cluster was a
characteristic of latent EBV infection and this expression
was relatively constant during virus replication [17]. In
contrast, miR-BHRF1-1, which showed constant expres￾sion between patients and controls in this study, is
strongly induced in lytic cycle and depended on viral
DNA replication [18]. Thus, we hypothesized that egg
food allergy was most likely to occur in EBV latent infec￾tion, and miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7 may have
particular influence in allergy individuals.
It has been established that viral miRNAs could nega￾tively regulate the expression of both human and viral
genes through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Although
most targets of EBV viral miRNAs are still not clear, some
of them have been identified previously. For example, viral
latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is the target of miR￾BART1-5p, miR-BART16-5p and miR-BART17-5p [19].
Several studies suggest that miR-BART1-5p negatively
regulates LMP1 gene expression through binding to spe￾cific sequences in 3’ UTR [20]. Meanwhile, LMP1 shows
multiple roles in immune regulation. It acts as a constitu￾tively active receptor that mimics activated CD40, regu￾lates different signaling pathways including NF-κB, AP-1,
p38-MAPK/ATF and STAT, interacts with multiple cyto￾kines such as IL-10, and plays a critical role in EBV￾induced B-cell transformation [21-24]. It is reasonable to
speculate that EBV latent miRNAs, such as miR-BART1-
5p, may influent immune regulation by multiple ways and
finally trigger or aggravate the food allergy reaction in
adults. To verify this hypothesis and to further reveal the
roles of the EBV miRNAs in FA, considerable investiga￾tions still need in this area.
In order to obtain more extensive information about
the relationship between EBV infection and FA, we also
analyzed the concentration of EBV DNA in patients and
controls. It was noteworthy that, EBV DNA was only
detected in very few allergic or healthy samples (one
case in each group) and the DNA burdens of these posi￾tive samples were relatively low (between 103
-104 cop￾ies/mL). One potential explanation may be the latent
stage of viral infection in patients with FA. Compared
with lysis stage, the serum virus load of latency may be
104
-105 folds lower, resulting in a negative PCR result
(the sensitivity of real-time PCR kit which was used in
our study is 103 copies/mL) [25]. This low detected ratio
was also observed in previous studies [11].
Serum allergen specific IgE may be the most widely
used marker in the diagnosis of FA nowadays. Although
its diagnosis and prognostic application is controversial
due to the variability of sample source, the lack of
standardization, and the potential inconsistence with
clinical symptoms [26], the detection of specific IgE is
easy to achieve a quantitative evaluation and the positive
results against culprit food enables sensitization to be
established. Therefore we quantified the egg-specific IgE
level by ELISA and correlated this data with both EBV
specific antibody titer and the expression of viral miR￾NAs. Notably, every one of the three EBV markers (anti
EBNA-1 IgG, miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7), which
showed a differential expression between allergic
patients and healthy control in this study, have a fair
correlation with egg-specific IgE. On one hand, these
correlations confirm the association between EBV

miRNAs and FA; On the other hand, it indicates that
many factors, such as EBV viral latent miRNAs, may in￾fluence the production of food-specific IgE, other than
the allergenicity of culprit food. Some signaling path￾ways, such as NF-κB and AP-1, may be involved in this
IgE producing process, as is discussed above.
Several limitations of this study include the limited
number of samples, not a long-term observation, and
the exclusion of other kinds of FA patients beside egg
protein. Because the prevalence of FA in adults is rela￾tively low, it is difficult to conduct a wider and more
extensive study. However, the mechanisms of different
food allergen-specific allergy are similar [27], so our
finding should also be observed in other food allergen￾specific reaction.
In conclusion, we report that patients with egg FA
have a relative higher concentration of anti-EBNA IgG,
EBV miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7. Furthermore, the
expression level of these infection markers correlates
with the concentration of egg-specific IgE. Although the
exact molecular mechanisms are yet to elucidate, this is
the first study suggests the possible role of EBV infection

adults. What is more, deeper investigations will be
required to determine the potential application of using
viral miR-BART1-5p and miR-BART7 in evaluating EBV
infection and their role in the pathogenesis of FA.
Methods
Study samples
Current study was carried out with the approval of the
ethical committee at Beijing Hospital. The study group
consisted of 34 out-patients (14 male, 20 female) who
had egg-specific FA diagnosed between September 2010
and December 2011 in the Beijing area, and oral
informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Inclusion criteria were (a) a clinical diagnosis of egg￾specific FA; (b) a positive result of EBV infection (EBV
seropositivity and/or EBV DNA positivity). The diagno￾sis of egg-specific FA was based on (a) a recent convin￾cing history of an immediate type clinical reaction to egg
with typical symptoms [8]; (b) a positive egg specific
(yolk and white) skin prick tests (SPTs) result judged by
the 95% predictive value for SPT weal diameter ≥ 3 mm
(GREER, USA) [28]; and (c) a positive result of open￾food challenge test participate the trail. Open-food chal￾lenge test was performed to confirm the diagnosis of egg
protein-specific food allergy [29]. Briefly, incremental
doses of cooked egg (raw HE yolk and white, simultan￾eously) were given at 30 mins intervals to get a cumula￾tive dose of 12g. The challenge was stopped when either
cumulative dose was tolerated or an objective reaction
[development of two or more of erythema, urticaria (dis￾tant to the mouth) or angiooedema, rhinoconjunctivitis,
wheeze, abdominal pain or vomiting] occurred. Food
challenge was performed in hospital by a trained phys￾ician and the subjects were observed for at least 2 h after
the last dose before being sent home. Exclusion criteria
were allergic reaction to other food allergens and no sig￾nificant response to eggs eliminating treatment.
34 healthy individuals attending for health examin￾ation between September 2010 and September 2011
were invited to participate as healthy controls. Ques￾tionnaires reported no history of allergy-related illness
and that enrolled control individuals were not actively
avoiding certain foods (including but not limiting to
egg). No positive result of egg-specific IgE (> 0.35 kU/L)
was identified in control group. All the enrolled control
individuals were EBV infected (EBV seropositivity and/
or EBV DNA positivity). The mean age was comparable
in allergic and controls group (p = 0.475, by t-test). The
female to male ratio was equal in both groups. There
was no relationship between age and sex in allergic
patients, healthy controls and all the individuals en￾rolled (p = 0.158, 0.631 and 0.608, by Spearman correl￾ation, respectively).
Serum samples of these participators were prepared
after centrifugation and stored frozen at −80°C within
one hour of collection. Informed consent was obtained
from each subject.
Egg-specific IgE ELISA
The egg-specific IgE levels are measured by food allergens
specific REAST commercial kits (FOOKE, Germany). All
tests were completed following the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions and each sample was analyzed in duplicate. Egg￾specific IgE concentration was determined by a standard
curve which was established by a series of calibrators. Spe￾cific IgE level over 0.35 kU/L were considered positive [26].
EBV-specific antibodies ELISA
Anti VCA, Anti EBNA-1 IgG and Anti VCA IgM were
assessed by commercially available ELISA kits (Euroim￾mun, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. For each assay, a standard curve was established
by calibrators supplied with the kits, and then used to
calculate specific antibody concentration.
EBV DNA real-time PCR
EBV DNA was extracted from serum samples using the
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the
instruction of the vendor. A fragment of β-actin (304 bp)
was amplified to confirm successful extraction of DNA
and no PCR inhibitors were present. The EBV DNA was
quantified by EBV PCR fluorescence quantitative diagnos￾tic kit (Daangene, China) using 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Each sample was ana￾lyzed in duplicate to obtain a final measurement expressed
as DNA copies per millilitre (copies/mL).
RNA Isolation
Before RNA extraction, patients’ serum were centrifuged
at 16,000 g for 10 min. Total RNA (including small RNA
molecules) was extracted from 500 μL serum superna￾tants by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and mirVana
miRNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) follow￾ing the instructions. The concentration and purity of the
RNA product was measured with ultraviolet spectropho￾tometer (Eppendorf, Germany).
Real-time RT-PCR
EBV coding miRNA (EBV-miR-BHRF1-1, EBV-miR-BAR
T1-5p and EBV-miR-BART7) sequences were obtained
from the Sanger miRNA Registry (http://microrna.sanger.
ac.uk) and stem-loop RT primers were designed based on
these sequences as previously described [30]. The miRNA
expression levels were quantified by real-time PCR using
PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Japan) and SYBR Pre￾mix Ex TaqII Kit (Takara, Japan). Briefly, approximate
50ng of small RNA from each sample was reverse￾Pan et al. Virology Journal 2013, 10:9 Page 7 of 9
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/9

transcribed to cDNA with stem-loop RT primer and U6
Reverse primer. Subsequently, real-time PCR was per￾formed on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, USA). All reactions were run in triplicate. Ct
data were determined by default threshold settings. In this
study, U6 RNA was chosen as a miRNA internal control.
The relative expression levels of miRNAs were calculated
in 2–ΔCt method [31], and the differences of miRNA con￾centration between allergy group and control group were
expressed as -fold changes.
Statistical analysis
Values were expressed as the mean ± SD. Differences
between two groups were analyzed by the Student t￾test. Antibody (egg-specific IgE, anti EBNA-1 IgG and
anti-VCA-IgG) levels had skewed distributions, so a
median (interquartile range) and Mann–Whitney U￾test, were applied to analyze the difference between
groups. Correlation was assessed by multiple linear re￾gression (adjusted for gender and age). The data with
skewed distributions (egg-specific IgE, anti EBNA-1
IgG and anti-VCA-IgG) were converted to logarithmic
form for linear regression. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS 17.0 statistics program (SPSS
Inc, USA). A p value <0.05 (two tailed) was considered
statistically significant.
