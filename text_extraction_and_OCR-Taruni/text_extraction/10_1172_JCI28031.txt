Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a process of fibro-obliterative occlusion of the small airways in the
transplanted lung, is the most common cause of lung transplant failure. We tested the role of cell-mediated
immunity to collagen type V [col(V)] in this process. PBMC responses to col(II) and col(V) were monitored
prospectively over a 7-year period. PBMCs from lung transplant recipients, but not from healthy controls or
col(IV)-reactive Goodpasture’s syndrome patients after renaltransplant, were frequently col(V) reactive.Col(V)-
specific responses were dependent on bothCD4+ T cells and monocytes and required both IL-17 and the mono￾kinesTNF-α and IL-1β. Strong col(V)-specific responses were associated with substantially increased incidence
and severity ofBOS.Incidences of acute rejection, HLA-DR mismatched transplants, and induction of HLA-spe￾cific antibodies in the transplant recipient were not as strongly associated with a risk ofBOS.These data suggest
that while alloimmunity initiates lung transplant rejection, de novo autoimmunity mediated by col(V)-specific
Th17 cells and monocyte/macrophage accessory cells ultimately causes progressive airway obliteration.
Introduction
Organ transplantation is the only definitive therapy for many 
forms of end-stage organ failure. Current immunosuppressive 
regimens are effective in reversing acute cellular rejection, yet are 
ineffective against the fibroproliferative process of chronic rejec￾tion that causes failure of most organ transplants (1). In lung 
transplantation, chronic rejection takes the form of obliterative 
bronchiolitis (OB). OB was first described in heart-lung transplant 
recipients as fibrous lesions occluding the terminal bronchioles, 
rapidly progressing between 2 and 3 years after transplant (2). 
Because of the patchy nature of OB, its diagnosis via transbron￾chial biopsy is difficult. Thus, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome 
(BOS), defined as a sustained decline of 20%–50% in forced expi￾ratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) relative to the maximum post￾transplant value, has become the standard clinical marker of OB. 
Once initiated, the obliterative process has no effective remedy and 
causes failure of more than 50% of lung allografts worldwide by 5 
years after transplant (3).
OB histopathology suggests that both inflammation and injury 
responses precede small airway obliteration. Acute rejection and allo￾antibody formation, primarily triggered by ubiquitous donor HLA 
proteins, are classically thought of as the basis for acute allograft 
rejection. Both are known to be associated with BOS onset (4, 5). Yet 
despite newer therapeutic agents that have reduced the incidence 
of lung transplant acute rejection, the incidence and severity of 
BOS remains unchanged. While deposition of complement cleav￾age products and alloantibodies to HLA class I and class II has been 
strongly associated with chronic rejection of kidney transplants (6), 
their association with BOS has been less consistent (5, 7–9).
An alternate hypothesis is that chronic rejection is the end result 
of transplant-induced autoimmunity. Ischemically injured organs 
express exposed or modified normal protein constituents. These 
changes may be inconsequential in an isograft setting because of 
the immune system’s capacity to buffer autoreactivity with regula￾tory T cells and dendritic cells. Yet in an allograft setting, allore￾active T and B cell responses to polymorphic HLA antigens may 
undermine immunoregulatory mechanisms, allowing de novo host 
T and B cell responses against nonpolymorphic graft neoantigens 
to develop. While both Ab-mediated (10–12) and cell-mediated (13, 
14) autoimmune responses may have pathogenic consequences, to 
our knowledge, it has yet to be shown that they can account for the 
fibro-obliterative occlusion of vascular and epithelial spaces seen 
in chronic rejection of human organ transplants.
Collagen type V [col(V)], a minor fibrillar collagen abundant 
in lung, skin, and placenta, is essential for tissue elasticity and 
compliance (15). Normally cryptic components of extracellular 
matrix, overlaid by major collagens I and III within mature 
collagen fibrils (16), col(V) fragments are released into the 
extracellular milieu after lung transplantation and can trigger T 
cell–dependent immunity (17). Col(V)-specific CD4+ T cell clones, 
derived from rejected rat lung allografts, induce acute rejection￾Nonstandard abbreviations used: BOS, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome; col(V),

like pathology in rat lung isografts upon adoptive transfer (13). 
Similarly, LN cells transferred from col(V)-immunized syngeneic 
rats cause acute rejection pathology in isografted lungs (18). In 
the latter model, vasculitis and bronchiolitis correlated with 
the local expression of IL-17 transcripts and acquisition of sys￾temic autoimmunity to col(V) in the adoptive host, measured by 
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to ear challenge 
(18). Here we tested the hypothesis that cell-mediated autoim￾munity specific to col(V) is a critical step in BOS progression in 
human lung transplants.
Results
CD4+ T cell– and monocyte-dependent cellular immunity to col(V) after lung 
transplant. The clinical characteristics of 65 study subjects are detailed 
in Table 1. Patients with primary lung transplants from deceased 
donors (n = 54) were enrolled in a prospective monitoring trial; their 
demographics and lung disease at the time of transplant are shown. 
Five patients with Goodpasture’s syndrome (GPS), all of whom had 
renal transplants from 1 HLA-haplotype matched living donors, and 
6 healthy nonsmoking subjects were included as controls.
Collagen-specific cell-mediated immunity was assessed using 
the trans-vivo DTH (TV-DTH) assay. Figure 1A shows respons￾es to recall antigen and to 3 different collagens for PBMCs of 
healthy normal subjects, renal transplant recipients, and a ran￾dom sample of 15 of the 54 lung transplant recipients. The lat￾ter were donating blood at their regular clinic visits to moni￾tor responses to col(II) and (V); col(IV), a ubiquitous basement 
membrane collagen (19), was added as a further specificity 
control. Renal transplant patients were selected because of the 
known autoimmunity to col(IV) in GPS (19) and because their 
immunosuppression regimen was similar to that of lung trans￾plant patients. As shown in Figure 1A, all 3 groups had positive 
responses (≥25 × 10–4 in. net swelling) to EBV or tetanus and 
diphtheria toxoid (TT/DT) recall antigens, indicating that mem￾ory T cell–dependent immunity remained intact despite immu￾nosuppression. Col(II), a fibrillar collagen specific to articular 
cartilage, did not elicit a TV-DTH response in patients or con￾trols. Renal transplant recipients with GPS had significantly 
(P < 0.001) elevated mean swelling responses to col(IV). Lung 
transplant recipients did not respond to col(IV), but did respond 
to col(V) (P < 0.001 versus controls or renal transplant recipients). 
The level of response to col(V) was quite variable, with 5 of 15 
patients having a response in the positive range (≥25 × 10–4 in.), 
including 2 with responses of 50 × 10–4 in. or more at a single 
sampling time point. Using recombinant α1(V) and α2(V) chains 
prepared from gene-transferrent fibroblast cell lines, the TV-DTH 
reactivity in 2 of these high-responder patients mapped to the 
α1(V) chain (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material 
available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI28031DS1).
To characterize the cells and cytokines mediating the swelling 
response to col(V), we obtained leukaphereses from 4 lung transplant 
recipients with col(V)-specific TV-DTH responses of 30 × 10–4 in. 
or greater. PBMCs and antigens were coinjected into the mouse 
footpad along with cytokine-neutralizing Abs. A strong swelling 
response to both TT/DT and col(V) was observed in the presence 
of isotype control IgG (Figure 1B). However, the responses differed 
markedly in cytokine requirements. The response to TT/DT was 
strongly inhibited by antibodies to human IFN-γ, but not by anti￾bodies to TNF-α or IL-1β, nor by Ab to human IL-17. In contrast, 
col(V)-specific TV-DTH responses were blocked by Abs neutral￾izing IL-17, TNF-α, or IL-1β, but not by anti–IFN-γ.
The differences in cytokine dependence of TV-DTH responses to 
col(V) and TT/DT were mirrored by their different cellular require￾ments. The response to TT/DT was abrogated by removal of CD4+
T cells, but was unaffected by CD14+ cell depletion (Figure 1C). In 
contrast, removal of either CD4+ or CD14+ cells markedly reduced 
col(V)-specific swelling. Depletion of CD8+ T cells had no effect on 
either response (Figure 1C and data not shown).
PBMCs from the col(V)-sensitized lung transplant recipients 
were then compared with PBMCs from 6 healthy controls for the 
in vitro release of cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β in response to 
antigen stimulation. IFN-γ was released into supernatants of teta￾nus toxoid–stimulated (TT-stimulated) PBMCs in both controls 
and patients (Figure 2A), along with a relatively low amount of 
TNF-α and no IL-1β. Control PBMCs did not respond to col(V). In 
contrast, the supernatants of col(V)–stimulated PBMCs from trans￾plant recipients were enriched in TNF-α and IL-1β relative to con￾trol PBMC cultures (P < 0.05) and relatively low in IFN-γ (P = NS). 
IL-17 release from col(V)-stimulated whole PBMCs was below the 
limits of detection by ELISA (data not shown).
Cellular requirements for the TNF-α response to col(V) were 
similar to those for the TV-DTH response, being unaffected by 
CD8 depletion, reduced by CD4 depletion, and eliminated by 
CD14 depletion (Figure 2B). Importantly, TNF-α release was 
inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by addition of anti–IL-17 
Ab, while anti–IFN-γ Ab enhanced the TNF-α response to col(V) 
(Figure 2B). A nonspecific toxic effect of anti–IL-17 Ab could be 
ruled out because IFN-γ responses in the same cultures were either 
unaffected or increased (data not shown).

It has previously been shown that recombinant human IL-17 
triggers rapid TNF-α and IL-1β release from monocytes of healthy 
controls (20). If the col(V)-induced cellular immune response of 
lung transplant patients relies on this same pathway, then the 
monocyte, and not the CD4+ T cell, would be the predicted source 
of TNF-α. To assess this possibility, we performed intracellular 
cytokine staining on short-term (5 h), brefeldin-treated cultures of 
whole PBMCs from patient L84 stimulated with col(II) or col(V). 
As shown in Figure 2C, the intracellular staining for TNF-α was 
largely confined to CD14+ monocytes and was specifically induced 
by col(V) and not by col(II) (3.23% and 0.82% positive cells, respec￾tively). Few CD3+ T cells made TNF-α specifically in response to 
col(V), and this was largely confined to CD8+ rather than the CD4+
(CD8–) T cell subset (Figure 2C).
Cell-mediated immunity to col(V) is strongly associated with onset of BOS. 
To test the hypothesis that development of col(V)-specific cell￾mediated immunity is involved in the process of OB, we conduct￾ed a prospective monitoring trial in 54 lung transplant recipients. 
The incidence of BOS was 26% (14 of 54) with a mean follow-up of 
3.5 ± 1.9 yr. From time-course analysis of pulmonary function, 6 of 
14 patients were classified as BOS-1 only (Supplemental Figure 2A) 
while 8 of 14 progressed to the most severe forms of respiratory 
failure, BOS-2 or BOS-3 (Supplemental Figure 2B).
Post-transplant cell-mediated immunity to col(V) was evaluated by 
the TV-DTH assay at multiple sampling time points, shown as dots 
on individual patient timelines (Figure 3). Col(II) served as a control 
antigen in all monitoring tests, which were performed prospectively 
using fresh blood samples by an individual blinded to the patient’s 
clinical status. Overall, the mean response to col(V) in 54 recipients 
was significantly elevated relative to col(II) (P < 0.0001; Supplemen￾tal Figure 3), confirming the results of the random sampling of 15 
patients shown in Figure 1A, and there were no significant differenc￾es in mean levels of post-transplant col(V)-specific TV-DTH reactiv￾ity among primary lung disease categories (Supplemental Figure 3).
Figure 3 depicts the time dependence of cell-mediated immune 
response to col(V) in peripheral blood, along with outcome data, 
in patients with maximum TV-DTH responses classified as low 
(<25 × 10–4 in., n = 22; Figure 3A), intermediate (25 × 10–4 in., n = 8; 
Figure 3B) or high (>25 × 10–4 in., n = 24; Figure 3C). None of the 22 
patients whose responses to col(V) remained low developed severe 
BOS: 19 (81%) maintained excellent allograft function, 2 (patients L44 
and L51) developed late-onset (>4 yr) BOS-1 that has not progressed 
further, and patient L18 expired with a functioning graft after 1 yr 
(Figure 3A). In the intermediate col(V) response group (Figure 3B), 
there was 1 case of BOS (patient L57) that occurred following a 
change from a negative to a positive anti-col(V) response. This patient 
progressed rapidly to BOS-2 and died 2.3 yr after transplant.
Patients with at least 1 time point of strongly positive TV-DTH 
response to col(V) had the highest incidence of severe BOS (7 of 
24, 29%; Figure 3C). There were 4 cases of BOS-1 only, including 1 
patient (L15) whose FEV1 values were declining precipitously but 
died before reaching BOS-2, and 2 patients (L52 and L65) whose 
pulmonary function declined to a BOS-2 level but partially recov￾ered to stabilize at BOS-1 (Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure 2).
To estimate the relative risk for BOS over time after transplant we 
used a Cox proportional hazards model. We analyzed the data in 2 
different ways: (a) by treating response at any time after transplant 
as a risk factor, and (b) with response treated as a time-varying, bina￾Figure 1

ry covariate. Using the former criteria, the hazard ratios for having 
a strongly positive post-transplant TV-DTH response to col(V) were 
very high: 5.4 for BOS-1 and 9.8 for BOS-2 (both P = 0.03; Table 2). 
At 3.5–5.7, hazards ratios were somewhat lower, but still statistically 
significant, when col(V) response was considered as time-varying, 
reflecting a tendency toward a positive response occurring at the last 
test before the BOS event (Figure 3, B and C). Response to col(II), 
tested concurrently, was not a significant BOS risk factor.
Antibodies to HLA were tested in 170 serum/plasma samples 
from 52 patients; 14 of 52 (27%) were positive for anti-HLA Ab at 1 
or more time points after transplant. The hazards ratio associated 
with a single time point of post-transplant anti-HLA (class I and/or 
class II) Ab positivity, regardless of specificity, was estimated at 1.5 
and 1.1 for BOS-1 and BOS-2, respectively, but neither reached sta￾tistical significance (Table 2). The risks of BOS associated with the 
number of acute rejection episodes also were not significant in the 
54-patient study group. However, in a larger cohort of 281 primary 
lung transplants, the acute rejection-associated risk ratios for BOS-1 
and BOS-2 were estimated at 1.4 and 1.5, respectively, both of which 
were highly significant (P < 0.0001). HLA-DR mismatch in the large 
cohort was a significant risk factor for severe BOS (relative risk, 1.9; 
P < 0.01), but not for BOS-1. Of the other risk factors tested, includ￾ing post-transplant CMV infection, HLA-A or -B mismatch, recipi￾ent age or gender, bilateral versus single lung transplant, donor age, 
CMV-positive donor to CMV-negative recipient, or primary disease, 
none were significant for BOS either in the prospective study group 
or in the larger retrospective analysis (data not shown).
The striking association of IL-17 and monokine-dependent 
TV-DTH responses to col(V) with onset of severe BOS in lung 
transplant patients suggests that allograft-induced, col(V)-spe￾cific Th17 cells and monocytes are causally linked to OB itself. 
To determine whether cell-mediated immunity to col(V) can gen￾erate an OB lesion in the absence of confounding factors such 
as alloreactivity and immunosuppression present in the setting 
of a clinical lung transplant, we used an orthotopic rat left lung 
isograft and adoptive transfer model. This model system has 3 
clinically relevant features: (a) col(V) immunization of Wistar￾Kyoto (WKY) rats upregulates IL-17 and IL-23 gene transcripts 
in LN cells; (b) adoptive transfer of such primed LN cells to a 
naive WKY rat results in systemic immunity to col(V) detected 
by direct DTH (ear challenge) assay; and (c) adoptive hosts that 
receive a WKY lung isograft develop acute lung injury with bron￾chiolitis and vasculitis confined to the isograft 1 day later (21). 
We analyzed lung immunopathology in these rats at 30 days after 
transplant. As shown in Figure 4, control LN cells from hen egg 
lysozyme–immunized (HEL-immunized) rats failed to cause any 
long-term airway pathology either in the isograft or in the native 
lung. In contrast, LN cells from col(V)-immunized rats caused 
classical OB lesions in the lung isograft by day 30 (Figure 4). 
Extensive collagen deposition typical of clinical OB was evident 
by trichrome staining. By immunostaining, col(V) was detected 
within the bronchiolar mucosal lamina propria, within the heav￾ily fibrosed bronchial smooth muscle layer, and at especially high 
levels within the dense connective tissue constituting the outer￾Figure 2

most layer of the bronchial wall and continuous with the alveolar 
septae, which were thickened in the OB lung (Figure 4). The same 
pattern of deposition of immunoreactive col(V) was seen in an 
adjacent obliterated vessel. Immunohistochemical staining for 
col(V) was mostly negative in the native lung of the same animal, 
except for faint immunostaining around the subepithelial base￾ment membrane, a normal finding.
Discussion
Chronic rejection of human lung transplants remains an enigmatic 
and clinically intractable problem more than 2 decades after its first 
description (2). Early studies of human lung allografts showed an 
elevated IgG2/IgG1 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients 
with acute rejection (22, 23). However, instead of Abs to polymor￾phic HLA proteins, such as those commonly found in serum dur￾ing lung transplant acute rejection (5), analysis of the IgG2 Abs in 
bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a dominant specificity for an ECM 
protein, the minor col(V) (D.S. Wilkes, unpublished observations). 
Under normal circumstances, col(V) is largely confined to the 
interior of mature col(I):col(V) heterotypic fibrils; acid treatment 
or limited protease digestion is required to expose col(V) epitopes 
(16). The ability of col(V) to become antigenic for a Th-dependent 
B cell response in lung transplants suggested both disruption of 
normal ECM structure and neoantigen creation. After extensive 
studies in rat indicated a critical role for col(V) autoimmunity in 
lung allograft tolerance and rejection (reviewed in ref. 24), human 
translational studies were initiated. Our present finding of a high 
incidence of CD4-dependent TV-DTH responses to col(V), but 
not to col(IV) or col(II), in PBMCs from lung transplant recipients 
and the previous finding of outgrowth of col(V)-specific CD4+ T 
cell lines from long-term cultures of patient PBMCs (25) confirm 
that col(V) becomes immunogenic after human lung transplanta￾tion. However, to our knowledge, evidence for a direct association 
of col(V)-specific cell-mediated immunity with lung transplant 
chronic rejection has been lacking until now.
The introduction of the TV-DTH assay (26, 27) when our prospec￾tive clinical study of BOS began was fortuitous, because it detected 
cell-mediated immune responses dependent on either Th1 (IFN-γ) 
or Th17 (IL-17) and monocyte (TNF-α, IL-1β) products (Figure 1). 
It was also quite sensitive. The Th17 subset of CD4+ T memory cells 
is in low frequency in human peripheral blood relative to the Th1 
(IFN-γ–producing) subset and typically produces 10- to 100-fold 
lower levels of cytokine after polyclonal stimulation (28). We have 
thus far been unsuccessful in detecting col(V)-induced IL-17 pro￾tein or mRNA in cultures of lung transplant patient PBMCs and 
have relied on the much stronger monokine signal as an in vitro 
correlate of the col(V)-specific TV-DTH response (Figure 2). Taking 
into account the low frequency of Th17 memory cells, and the fact 
that all patients were taking multiple immunosuppressive drugs, 
the detection of col(V)-specific cell-mediated immune responses in 
the majority of lung transplant recipients is quite remarkable. The 
critical role of both CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells suggests 
an explanation: that immunosuppressive regimens currently used 
in lung transplantation may fail to prevent de novo Th17-depen￾dent immune responses (29). An interesting exception may be the 
macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, currently being used to treat 
established BOS; its unique ability to block downstream effects 
of IL-17 on lung tissue may account for its efficacy (30). The phe￾nomenon of monocyte–CD4+ T cell interactions leading to mono￾kine production closely parallels findings in rheumatoid arthritis 
(31), a disease that is resistant to calcineurin inhibitors but often 
responsive to treatment with TNF-α antagonists (32). The corre￾lation of col(V)-specific autoimmunity with BOS in our prospec￾tive study is also consistent with the ability of anti–TNF-α and 
anti–IL-1β Abs to block airway obliteration in the mouse tracheal 
allograft model (33) and with the prominent role of monokines 
and monocyte recruitment in the alloantigen-independent phase 
of classical chronic rejection (34).
Antibodies to HLA class I or class II antigens were detected in 14 
of 52 (27%) patients tested, but did not prove to be a significant risk 
factor for BOS (Table 2). In contrast, other published studies using 
ELISA and flow cytometry techniques have found a significant cor￾relation between anti-HLA Abs in general, or donor-specific HLA Abs

in particular, and subsequent BOS development (5, 9). Sample size 
may be one limiting factor in our study: for example, neither acute 
rejection nor HLA-DR mismatch were significant risk factors for 
BOS in the study subgroup (n = 54), but both became significant in 
analysis of the cohort of 281 lung transplant recipients (Table 2).
The magnitude of estimated risk of BOS associated with col(V)-
specific cell-mediated immunity was 3- to 5-fold for BOS-1; this 
risk increased to 5- to 10-fold for BOS-2, the severe form of lung 
chronic rejection. Besides col(V) TV-DTH response, certain other 
risk factors such as HLA-DR mismatch (Table 2 and ref. 35) and 
the appearance of lymphocytic bronchitis/bronchiolitis on surveil￾lance biopsy (5) have also been associated with a higher risk for 
BOS-2 versus BOS-1. HLA-DR mismatch tends to prevent estab￾lishment of immune regulation to allografts (36); thus it may also 
predispose to an imbalance between self-reactive T regulatory and 
T effector cells that could promote a breakdown of col(V)-specific 
tolerance (25). Lymphocytic bronchitis itself could be an indicator 
of an immune attack on areas of col(V) exposure (18).
This possibility is supported by the ability, demonstrated here, 
(a) to generate an OB-like lesion in a rat lung isograft by adoptive 
transfer of LN cells from col(V)-immunized donors and (b) to detect 
col(V) antigen in the rat OB lung under nondenaturing conditions 
(Figure 4). The latter finding is significant because col(V) epitopes 
cannot be readily detected by immunohistochemistry in normal tis￾sues unless these tissues are first denatured to disrupt col(I) and/or 
col(V) fibrils, thereby exposing col(V) epitopes (16). Col(V) tran￾scripts are among the most highly upregulated of all matrix pro￾teins in recently transplanted allografts (37). Once the initial graft 
injury has healed, there may be lingering deposits of exposed col(V) 
within airway parenchyma and perivascular interstitium (21). These 
deposits can serve as an antigen source for uptake and presentation 
of col(V) peptides, for example by monocytes and macrophages, to 
col(V)-specific Th17 effector cells that reach the graft long after the 
initial repair process has subsided. Furthermore, gastroesophageal 
reflux disorder (38) and community-acquired respiratory viruses 
(39) may promote BOS by causing acid- or collagenase-mediated 
exposure of col(V) from a normally sequestered position in the 
interior of mature heterotypic col(I) and/or col(V) fibrils (16). In 
particular, during ECM repair, normally rare col(V) homotrimers, 
composed of 3 α1(V) chains, can occur. These would be excluded 
from heterotypic col(I)/col(V) fibrils and thus expose α1(V) epit￾opes (40), which include the immunodomi￾nant antigens for CD4+ T cells detected by 
TV-DTH (Supplemental Figure 1B).
Persistent col(V) reactivity in the PBMCs 
without BOS development (for example, 
patients L16, L41, and L24; Figure 3C) may 
indicate a failure of monocytes and col(V)-
specific CD4+ T cells to mobilize from the 
blood to the graft. Chemokine receptors 
specifically expressed by human Th17 
cells have recently been identified (28). 
Their ligands, when expressed by the target 
organ, may be particularly important in 
the mobilization process. In addition, col￾lagen-specific activating receptors such as 
discoidin domain receptor 1 on monocytes 
and fibroblasts (41) may synergize with 
signaling via IL-17 receptors, propagating 
lung fibroproliferative lesions.
We acknowledge limitations to our study. First, we relied upon a 
single measure of cell-mediated immunity, the TV-DTH assay, to 
prospectively monitor lung transplant recipients over a 7-yr peri￾od. This test requires crosstalk between human cytokines and cells 
in the SCID mouse footpad leading to chemokine-driven recruit￾ment of a granulocyte-rich mouse leukocyte infiltrate (ref. 27 
and L.D. Haynes, E. Jankowska-Gan, W. Burlingham, and J. Tor￾realba, unpublished observations). While in vitro analysis of 
cytokine release from antigen-stimulated PBMCs tends to validate 
the TV-DTH assay for type 1 and type 17 responses, we have not 
evaluated other types of human T cell–dependent responses, such 
as type 2 reactions, that may also be important in OB and/or BOS 
(42). Second, there were gaps in the follow-up of some patients, 
while others were sampled more regularly; importantly, the aver￾age frequency of sampling was not different among low, interme￾diate, and high col(V) responders. Third, PBMCs from 1 of 4 col(V) 
TV-DTH+ patients produced IFN-γ in response to col(V) challenge 
in vitro; this finding suggests heterogeneity in the types of CD4+
T cells responding to this autoantigen and merits caution in the 
conclusion that all such cells are Th17 type.
In summary, prospective monitoring of human lung transplant 
patients revealed a critical role of col(V)-specific cellular immu￾nity in the progression of OB, while confirming previous studies 
that indicate a role for HLA-specific immunity and acute rejec￾tion in the initiation of this process. Rat studies confirmed that 
col(V)-immune lymphoid cells caused OB lesions in a lung iso￾graft but not in native lung of a syngeneic recipient. Analysis of 
patient responses suggests that an interplay between Th17 cells 
and monocytes is critically important in this allograft-induced 
autoimmune response. Recent data implicating IL-1β as the criti￾cal monokine driving differentiation of human Th17 cells (43) is 
entirely in line with our findings and suggests an amplification 
loop whereby col(V) immunoreactivity begets more autoimmune 
effector T cells. The immunobiology of col(V)-reactive CD4+ effec￾tor and regulatory T cells, the biochemistry of exposure of the α1 
chain of col(V) in the human lung transplant, and the mechanism 
of human Th17 cell–dependent monocyte activation and pulmo￾nary fibrosis all warrant further investigation. Current clinical 
practice with respect to prophylaxis of BOS is clearly inadequate 
and may benefit substantially from consideration of the autoim￾mune component of this disease.

Methods
Subjects. Immunologic monitoring was performed prospectively on blood 
samples obtained at 3- to 6-month intervals, and annually after year 2, from 
54 recipients of primary lung transplants at the University of Wisconsin–
Madison between May 1998 and June 2005. Subject consent was obtained 
using human subjects committee–approved, written, informed consent pro￾cedures at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. Blood samples 
were collected and processed as described previously (36), and the PBMC 
fraction was tested within 24 hours. PBMC samples from 6 healthy non￾transplanted volunteers and 5 renal transplant recipients with GPS served 
as controls. Detailed analyses of col(V)-specific T cell response in selected 
patients and controls were performed using cryopreserved leukapheresis 
samples. Plasma samples obtained at the time of blood collection were fro￾zen for retrospective analysis of anti-HLA Ab. Immunosuppression therapy 
and acute rejection diagnosis and treatment were described previously (44).
Pulmonary function tests were performed at regular clinic visits; addi￾tional visits were scheduled when home spirometry measurements indi￾cated a decline in FEV1. Maximum FEV1 was established by the average 
of the 2 highest measurements taken at least 3 wk apart in the first year. 
BOS was diagnosed by a sustained drop in FEV1 below 80% of maximum, 
designated BOS-1, or below 65% of maximum, designated BOS-2 (3). 
BOS-2 or higher represented a relatively severe impairment of airflow, 
most likely indicative of OB.
TV-DTH assay. CB-17 SCID mice were purchased (Harlan Sprague-Dawley 
Inc.) or were bred locally. All animals were housed and treated in accordance 
with NIH guidelines, using protocols approved by the Research Animal 
Resources Centers of University of Wisconsin and University of Indiana Med￾ical School. TV-DTH was performed by cotransfer of human PBMCs and 
antigens into the footpads of SCID mice as described previously (26, 27, 45). 
Inactivated EBV (Viral Antigens Inc.) and TT/DT (Aventis-Pasteur Inc.) were 
used as positive control recall antigens. Two sources of col(V) from human 
placenta were used: (a) purified col(V) (obtained from D. Brand, University 
of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA) as described elsewhere (17), and 
(b) tissue-culture grade col(V) purchased from BD Biosciences. The former 
was used for TV-DTH monitoring tests, the latter for in vitro assays. Human 
col(IV) (Fluka Inc.) and col(II) (Southern Biotech) were purchased. Collagens 
were tested at 5 μg per injection for TV-DTH monitoring tests. Background 
swelling due to PBMCs with buffer alone was subtracted to determine anti￾gen-specific response. In some experiments, immunomagnetic beads (MACs 
Beads; Miltenyi Biotec) were used to deplete CD4+, CD8+, or CD14+ cells 
from PBMCs prior to TV-DTH or in vitro cytokine assays. In some assays, 
cytokines were neutralized with 5 μg coinjection of antibodies to human 
IFN-γ, TNF-α (both from BD Biosciences), IL-1β (eBiosciences), or IL-17 
(R&D Systems). The antibodies did not crossreact with mouse cytokines.
In vitro cytokine analysis. Whole or subset-depleted PBMCs (5 × 105 cells/
well) were cultured with human col(V) (20 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) or TT 
(0.5 μg/ml, a gift from J.E. Gumperz, University of Wisconsin–Madison) in 
RPMI1640 with 10% FCS for 20 h. Cells were spun down, and supernatant 
was harvested for ELISA. The Ab pairs and standard for TNF-α, IL-Iβ, and 
IFN-γ were purchased from BD Biosciences, eBiosciences, and Endogen, 
respectively. Horseradish peroxidase (Poly-HRP-20; Research Diagnostics) 
was used as a third reagent. The ELISA was developed with SureBlue TMB 
Microwell Substrate and Stop Solution (KPL).
For intracellular staining of TNF-α, PBMCs were cultured with either 
col(V) or col(II) (20 μg/ml) in the presence of brefeldin A for 5 h. Harvested 
cells were fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm and stained 
with CD8-FITC, CD14-PE, anti-human TNF-α–APC, and CD3–Alexa Fluor 
700 (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was performed on SLR II (BD Biosci￾ences) and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star) software.
Anti-HLA Ab detection. Samples of plasma were thawed, encoded, and 
tested in blinded fashion at a 1:3 dilution for anti-HLA Ab by indirect 
immunofluorescence using the PRA class I and class II mixed antigen 
screening system (LabScreen mixed antigen beads; One Lambda Inc.). Sin￾gle HLA-coated beads were used as a secondary screen to be sure that weak

positive reactions were not overlooked. Positive and negative cutoff values 
were determined based on specific immunofluorescence values for a given 
batch of HLA-coated beads.
Rat lung transplantation model. The orthotopic transplantation of left 
lung isografts (WKY→WKY) and adoptive transfer of LN cells from col(V) 
or HEL-immunized WKY rats (1 d prior to transplant) was performed as 
previously reported (21). No immunosuppressive therapy was given at any 
time during the experimental period. Thirty days after transplantation, 
native and transplanted lungs were harvested, fixed, sectioned, and stained. 
Grading for rejection pathology was performed in a blinded fashion by a 
pulmonary pathologist using ISHLT standard criteria.
Statistics. The criterion used for a positive human TV-DTH response was a 
footpad swelling of ≥25 × 10–4 in. over PBMC-plus-PBS background swelling. 
Analyses of BOS risk were done using TV-DTH response of 25 × 10–4 in. and 
greater. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the associa￾tion between suspected risk factors, some of which were time-varying, and 
BOS-free survival. In the time-varying analysis, the covariate was considered 
on when a response is positive and off when it becomes negative, etc.
For time-varying covariates in the Cox model, we carried the most recent￾ly measured values forward to each event time. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
was used for all other comparisons unless otherwise specified. P values less 
than 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using 
SAS statistical software release 6.12 (SAS Institute Inc.).
