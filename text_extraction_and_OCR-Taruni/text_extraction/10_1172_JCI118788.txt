Abstract
Excessive mesangial cell (MC) proliferation is a hallmark of
many glomerulopathies. In our recent study on cultured rat
MC (Matousovic, K., J.P. Grande, C.C.S. Chini, E.N. Chini,
and T.P. Dousa. 1995. J. Clin. Invest. 96:401–410) we found
that inhibition of isozyme cyclic-39,59-nucleotide phospho￾diesterase (PDE) type III (PDE-III) suppressed MC mitoge￾nesis by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)
and by decreasing activity of mitogen-activated protein ki￾nase (MAPK). We also found that inhibition of another
PDE isozyme, PDE-IV, suppresses superoxide generation in
glomeruli (Chini, C.C.S., E.N. Chini, J.M. Williams, K. Ma￾tousovic, and T.P. Dousa. 1994. Kidney Int. 46:28–36). We
thus explored whether administration in vivo of the selec￾tive PDE-III antagonist, lixazinone (LX), together with the
specific PDE-IV antagonist, rolipram (RP), can attenuate
development of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis
(MSGN) induced in rats by anti–rat thymocyte serum
(ATS). Unlike the vehicle-treated MSGN rats, rats with
MSGN treated with LX and RP did not develop proteinuria
and maintained normal renal function when examined 5 d
after injection of ATS. In PAS-stained kidneys from PDE￾antagonists–treated MSGN-rats the morphology of glomer￾uli showed a reduction in cellularity compared with control
rats with ATS. Compared with MSGN rats receiving vehi￾cle, the MSGN rats receiving PDE-antagonists had less
glomerular cell proliferation (PCNA d 265%), a signifi￾cantly lesser macrophage infiltration (d 236% ED-1) and a
significant reduction of a-smooth muscle actin expression
by activated MC; in contrast, immunostaining for platelet
antigens and laminin were not different. The beneficial ef￾fect of PDE inhibitors was not due to a moderate decrease
(z 220%) in systolic blood pressure (SBP); as a similar de￾crease in SBP due to administration of hydralazine, a drug
devoid of PDE inhibitory effect, did not reduce severity of
MSGN in ATS-injected rats. We conclude that antagonists
of PDE-III and PDE-IV administered in submicromolar
concentrations in vivo to ATS-injected rats can decrease the
activation and proliferation of MC, inhibit the macrophage
accumulation, and prevent proteinuria in the acute phase of
MSGN. We propose that PDE isozyme inhibitors act to
block (negative “crosstalk”) the mitogen-stimulated intra￾cellular signaling pathway which controls MC proliferation
due to activating of the cAMP-PKA pathway. These results
suggest that antagonists of PDE-III and IV may have a sup￾pressive effect in acute phases or relapses of glomerulopa￾thies associated with MC proliferation. (J. Clin. Invest.

Introduction
Excessive proliferation of mesangial cells (MC)1
 is a frequent
characteristic of many glomerular diseases caused by immuno￾logic or other mechanisms of glomerular cell injury (1, 2). In
particular, IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease) and the nephri￾tis associated with Schönlein-Henoch purpura (3, 4), are char￾acterized by active proliferation of MC as compared with
other cell types endogenous to glomerulus (1, 3, 4). IgA ne￾phropathy is presently recognized as the most common form
of acute glomerulonephritis worldwide with as many as 50%
eventually progressing to end-stage renal disease (3, 4). Effec￾tive and specific treatment of IgA nephropathy is lacking, al￾though a recent report suggests that treatment with fish oil
may slow progression (5). In view of the perceived importance
of MC proliferation in IgA-nephropathy as well as other pro￾liferative glomerular diseases, considerable effort has been de￾voted to clarifying the cellular mechanisms of MC proliferation
with the aim of designing new specific and effective pharmaco￾therapies.
An experimental model of mesangial proliferative nephri￾tis (MSGN) can be induced in rats with monoclonal or poly￾clonal (ATS) antibodies to the Thy-1.1 antigen, which is ex￾pressed on the rat mesangial cell membrane (6, 7). In this
model, after single ATS injection, an initial complement-depen￾dent mesangiolysis is followed by a rapid proliferation of the
MC population, the acquisition of a phenotype by the MC
characteristic of “myofibroblasts,” and a matrix expansion

within 4–6 d (1, 8). Indeed, similar proliferative and pheno￾typic changes of the MC population have been documented in
human glomerular diseases, including IgA nephropathy (1, 3).
In our recent study of rat MC in vitro (9) we observed that
the mitogen-stimulated signaling pathway in MC can be inhib￾ited by “negative crosstalk” with the cAMP-signaling pathway
(10–12). MC proliferation in vitro under ambient growth con￾ditions, (i.e., only under influence of mitogens synthesized en￾dogenously in MC) (13), as well as when maximally stimulated
by exogenous EGF or PDGF, is strongly suppressed by the ad￾dition of cyclic-39,59-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE)
isozyme-selective antagonists which inhibit PDE isozyme type￾III (PDE-III). Selective inhibitors of other types of PDE
isozyme types (gene families) (14, 15) had no such inhibitory
effect, except that antagonists of isozyme PDE-IV enhanced
the effect of the PDE-III antagonists and also had marginal in￾hibitory effects upon MC mitogenesis alone (9). The PDE-III
isozyme antagonists suppressed mitogenesis in MC without
addition of stimulant(s) of adenylate cyclase and without mea￾surable increase in MC content of cAMP (9). However, in situ
activity of cAMP-protein kinase (PKA) was increased and the
activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was in￾hibited (9). These results indicate that PDE-III antagonists
suppressed MC proliferation by interfering with a signaling
step of the mitogen-stimulated pathway upstream to MAPK
(10–12), probably by inhibiting the activity of protein kinase
Raf-1, an enzyme which initiates the mitogen kinase phosphor￾ylating cascade (10–12). The inhibition of Raf-1 protein kinase
activity was reported to be due to decreased phosphorylation
of Ser43 by activated PKA (12).
In another preceding study (16) we found that the antago￾nist of PDE-IV, rolipram, inhibits generation of reactive oxy￾gen metabolites (ROM) in glomeruli (16), and more recently
also in MC (19). ROM are known not only to inflict cell dam￾age (18, 19) but also, as recently proposed, can serve as intracel￾lular signals—”second messengers” (20). In MC an increase in
generation of ROM is known to stimulate synthesis of mono￾cyte chemoattractant protein MCP-1 and colony stimulating
factor CSF-1 (21).
We hypothesized that antagonists of PDE-III and PDE-IV
will exert in vivo effects upon MC (and perhaps other glomer￾ular cells) similar to those which we observed in vitro (9, 16,
17) and will suppress MC proliferation and other pathogenic
processes in development of MSGN. In view of these consider￾ations, we investigated whether antagonists of PDE-III and
PDE-IV exhibit similar effects in vivo as in vitro; namely to in￾hibit MC proliferation. In experiments reported herein we ex￾amined the effect of PDE-III and PDE-IV antagonists on rats
developing MSGN induced by ATS and examined renal tissue
on the fifth day after ATS, at the height of the disease and MC
proliferation (1, 8). We found that after injection of ATS con￾tinuous administration of the PDE-III antagonist, lixazinone
(22) and the PDE-IV antagonist, rolipram (23), prevented de￾velopment of proteinuria and greatly suppressed the histo￾pathologic changes, namely cell proliferation and phenotypic
alterations, found in rats with anti Thy-1.1 MSGN.
Methods
Male Wistar rats (180–220 grams; Simonsen Inc., Gilroy, CA) were
housed in individual metabolic cages during the course of the experi￾ment. As in previous studies (24, 25), the observation baseline before
administration of the anti-thymocyte antiserum (ATS) was 2 d (day
22, 21) (see Fig. 1). On day 0 the ATS and PDE isozyme antagonists
were injected and osmotic minipumps (Alzet®) implanted under ket￾amine-xylazine anesthesia; the following days are numbered and des￾ignated 11–15. In some rats during the course of the experiment the
daily urine volume (U·V), fluid intake, and U·VCr were measured;
systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored daily by the tail-cuff
sphygmomanometric method, using a Doppler ultrasound detector.
On days 22, 12 and 15, the urinary excretion of protein per 24 h was
determined. At the end of the experiment on day 15, animals were
anesthetized, an aortic blood sample was collected for determination
of plasma chemistries, and the kidneys were removed and cortical bi￾opsies fixed in methyl Carnoy’s solution, formaldehyde, or quickly
snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.
General experimental design (See Fig. 1). Three groups of rats
were studied. The control group (group A) received only nonimmune
goat serum on day 0 (n 5 5). Rats with experimental MSGN (n 5 9)
without treatment (group B) had two osmotic minipumps containing
solvents in the same amount and concentration but without the tested
drugs (placebo) implanted into the peritoneal cavity under anesthesia
(day 0) and then injected i.v. with the solvent of priming dose of PDE
isozyme antagonists and 10 min later i.v. with 4 ml/kg of goat ATS.
The amount of solvents administered to group B was identical to
group C. Rats with MSGN treated by PDE isozyme antagonists (n 5
7) (group C) were implanted i.p. with two osmotic minipumps with
drugs and injected with 4 ml/kg ATS i.v. at the same time sequence as
animals of group B (10 min after receiving i.v. injection of the priming
dose of lixazinone and rolipram) in the same solvents as group B.
Drugs for maintenance delivery (group C) or vehicle (group B) were
loaded to two osmotic minipumps which were implanted i.p. under
anesthesia. Rats were anesthetized by a mixture of ketamine 100 mg/
ml and xylazine 20 mg/ml mixed (1:1) in dose 0.2 ml/200 g b.wt. The
Alzet® minipumps (Model 2 ml, 10 ml/h delivery 7 d) were filled, one
with 6.5 mg/ml lixazinone (LX) solubilized in a solvent containing
10% ascorbic acid and tert-butanol (1:1), pH z 2.6; another with 8.9
mg/ml rolipram (RP) dissolved in 50% DMSO. The minipumps were
prewarmed in isotonic saline for 4 h before implantation to assure im￾mediate delivery of the drugs. Priming dose of LX was 1 mg/kg body
weight and rolipram 0.55 mg/kg body weight. Priming and mainte￾nance doses were estimated (22, 23, 26) to achieve plasma levels of
LX>0.4 mM and RP>1 mM, assuming total body fluid distribution
(26). At the end of experiments, the pumps were weighed to confirm that
the expected amount of fluid was delivered during the period of im￾plantation, as designed. LX (22) and RP (23) were selected as the most
potent and specific inhibitors of PDE-III and PDE-IV now available,
which were also used in our in vitro study on cultured MC (9).
In a separate group of rats we examined the effect of lowering of
SBP upon development of MSGN, and the design is depicted in Fig.
1. The two groups of rats were injected on day 0 with ATS and im￾planted with Alzet® minipumps containing either (3 mg/kg per day)
hydralazine dissolved in 0.9% NaCl, or control group received sol￾vent only. The rats received hydralazine in a dose aimed to achieve a
plasma concentration of z 0.4 mM which, as we determined in pre￾liminary studies, decreased SBP about d 2 20%, i.e., comparable with
PDE isozyme antagonists. Measurement of SBP and other parame￾ters were similar to studies with PDE isozyme antagonists. Whether
hydralazine has any effect upon PDE was tested using the same PDE
assay as in the preceding study (9, 32); extract (32) from renal cortical
tissue was used as a source of PDE. We observed that 0.4 or 4 mM hy￾dralazine had no effect upon cAMP or cGMP hydrolysis while LX,
RP, and other PDE isozyme antagonists showed typical inhibition.
Analytical procedures and materials. Plasma and urine creatinine
were measured using standard calorimetric methods, plasma proteins
by Lowry’s method (28), calcium by atomic absorption spectrometry,
and phosphate by the method of Chen et al. (32). For determination
of urinary protein the urine collected in 24 h was filtered, precipitated
by 5% (final concentration) trichoracetic acid (TCA), collected by
centrifugation, and measured by the method of Lowry et al. (28). The

264 Tsuboi et al.
content of AMP and cGMP in plasma were determined in pre-acylated
samples by radioimmunoassays, as used in our previous studies (30).
Immunostaining. Renal biopsies were placed in methyl Carnoy’s
solution, embedded in paraffin, and cut in 5-mm sections for indirect
immunoperoxidase staining as previously described (24, 25) using di￾aminobenzidine with nickel as a chromogen. Renal histology was
evaluated by routine PAS staining.
To determine the number of proliferating glomerular cells, we
used antibody to PCNA, which is expressed from late G1
 to M phase
of cell cycle. A murine monoclonal IgM antibody against PCNA (1:
1000 dilution; 19A2, Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL) was incu￾bated overnight at 48C followed by a peroxidase-conjugated rat anti–
mouse IgM (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). Black nuclear
staining was detected using diaminobenzidine (Sigma Chemical Co.,
St. Louis, MO) with nickel as a chromogen. To determine the number
of proliferating cells in individual animals, 50 glomerular profiles
from each renal biopsy was analyzed, and positive staining was de￾fined as black nuclear staining.
To determine phenotypic change of MC (26), we used mono￾clonal antibody (IgG2A; Sigma Chemical Co.) to a-smooth muscle
actin (a-sm actin).
A semiquantitative evaluation was used (24, 25) where each
glomerulus was graded (25) on scale of 11→14 using the following
criteria: 11 denotes , 25% positive stains per glomerulus; 12 de￾notes 25–50% positive stains; 13 denotes 50–75% positives; and 14
is grade where . 75% of glomerulus is positive. The score is based on
50 glomeruli in renal tissue samples from each rat; the mean score
was computed to obtain mean6SEM for each experimental group
(A, B, and C).
Macrophages were immuno-stained with ED-1 mouse mono￾clonal IgG (Scrotel, Washington, DC) directed against cytoplasmic
antigen present in monocyte macrophages and dendritic cells. Values
denote the number of macrophages from 20 glomeruli in kidneys of
each animal, similarly as for PCNA stain.
Staining for platelet antigens was performed with a murine mono￾clonal antibody against rat platelets, (PL-1, a gift of Dr. W.W.
Becker, Groningen, The Netherlands). The method of scoring was
11→14 as described for a-sm-actin (see above), the average is re￾ported.
Laminin was detected using a rabbit anti–rat laminin polyclonal
antibody (Chemicon International, El Segundo, CA). We used a scor￾ing system graded 0→14, where 0 denotes absence of any staining
and scores 11→14. In each rat kidney 50 glomeruli were examined.
Materials. Lixazinone (LX), N-cyclohexyl-N-methyl-4 (7-oxy￾1,2,3,5-tetrahydroimide 20 [2,1-b] quinazolin-2-one) butyramide (RS￾82856) was a gift from Dr. R. Alvarez (Syntex Research, Palo Alto,
CA). Rolipram (RP), 4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-pyri￾dine (ZK 62711) was a gift from Berlex Laboratories (Cedar Knolls,
NJ) and Schering A.G. Pharmaceutical (Berlin, Germany). The
cAMP-RIA kits were purchased from Biomedical Technologies Inc.
(Stoughton, MA); cGMP-RIA kits from Du-Pont NEN (Boston, MA).
Osmotic minipumps (Alzet®) were from Alza Co. (Palo Alto, CA).
All other chemicals, all of the highest purity grade available, were
purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., or other standard suppliers.
All analyses were performed in a blinded fashion using coded
samples, an identity of the samples was not revealed until the analysis
was complete. The results were evaluated by Student’s t test for group
or paired comparison; P , 0.05 was considered statistically signifi￾cant.
Results
Functional parameters. During the course of the study no ani￾mals showed clinically adverse effects. At the end of the exper￾iment (day 15) the three experimental groups of rats (Fig. 1),
(i.e.; [group A] controls; [group B] ATS-injected rats receiving
placebo; and ATS-injected rats receiving PDE isozyme antag￾onists lixazinone [LX] and rolipram [RP] [group C]), did not
differ in body weight or in plasma creatinine (data not shown).
Likewise, plasma cAMP did not differ between control rats
(group A: 6363 nM; mean6SE, n 5 5) and ATS-injected rats
given placebo (group B: 5663 nM; mean6SE, n 5 9) while in
ATS-injected rats treated with LX and RP the plasma cAMP
was significantly (P , 0.01; t test) elevated (group C: 117616
nM; mean6SE, n 5 7). The three groups did not differ in plasma
levels (in nM, mean6SE) of cGMP (group A: 12.762.4, n 5 5;
group B: 13.763.2, n 5 9; group C: 12.162.8, n 5 7).
In several rats from each group functional parameters were
monitored during the course of experiment (from day 22 to
day 15) (Fig. 1). Throughout the experiment (from day 22 to
day 15) the three groups did not differ in urinary volume, fluid
intake, and urinary excretion of creatinine (UCrV) (data for
the last day of experiment are shown in Table I, other days not
shown). The systolic blood pressure (SBP) was identical in all
three groups on day 22 and day 21 and in groups A and B the
SBP remained unchanged for the rest of the study, i.e., up to
day 15 (Fig. 2). In group C rats, after receiving a priming dose
and implantation of the osmotic minipumps with LX and with
RP for continuous delivery of maintaining dose on day 0,
showed modest but significant (d 2 1962%, mean6SEM;

days 21 and 22. Thereafter, the SBP in group C remained
constant at a significantly lower level (z d 2 18% difference
from groups A and B) for the rest of the experiment, i.e., days
11 – 15 (Fig. 2).
Before the injection of ATS, no difference in urinary pro￾tein excretion was present between the three groups (Fig. 2).
Compared with control rats (group A), ATS-injected rats
(group B) developed frank proteinuria (. 63 higher than in
controls) on the day 12, whereas ATS-injected rats treated
with PDE isozyme antagonists (group C), in the same time,
showed no significant difference in protein excretion from con￾trol group A (Fig. 2). In non-treated ATS-injected rats (group
B) the extent of proteinuria declined from 12 d to 15 d (Fig.
2), nevertheless, on the day 15 the urinary protein excretion
remained more than 4 fold higher in group B than in control
group A and in ATS-injected rats treated with PDE isozyme
antagonists; (group C) (Fig. 2). Plasma creatinine, calculated
creatinine clearance, total plasma protein and plasma phos￾phate and calcium or cGMP obtained at day 15 (Table I) were
not different between the three groups A, B, and C. Only the
plasma levels of cAMP were significantly higher ATS-injected

group treated with PDE isozyme antagonists (group C), com￾pared with other two groups, i.e., group A and group B (Table I).
Histologic studies. Renal cortical tissue evaluated by PAS
stain (Fig. 3) from ATS-injected rats (group B) at day 15
showed mesangial hypercellularity, with occasional disintegra￾tion of mesangial architecture, an increased frequency of mi￾totic figures and marked expansion of extracellular matrix—
changes typical (1, 24, 25) for this stage of the MSGN model
(Fig. 3). Extraglomerular tissue was not affected (Fig. 3). In
contrast, in ATS-injected rats treated with PDE isozyme inhib￾itors LX and RP (group C) the pathologic changes were mild
and the glomerular morphology was quite comparable to con￾trols (group A) (Fig. 3).
Quantitative evaluation of glomerular cell proliferation by
measurement of PCNA-staining cells (Fig. 4 A) in glomeruli
showed a 10-fold increase of PCNA-positive cells in untreated
ATS-injected rats at day 15 (group B) compared with controls
(group A). In contrast, in glomeruli of ATS-rats receiving
PDE isozyme inhibitors (group C) the number of PCNA-posi￾tive cells was significantly lower (d 2 58%) than in ATS-injected
rats without treatment (group B) (Fig. 4 A). Immunostaining
of glomeruli with ED-1, a specific antibody to macrophage/
monocytes, also demonstrated a significant macrophage influx
(d 1 129%) in group B (Fig. 4 B). However, the influx of mac￾rophages was significantly reduced d 2 36%) in rats treated
with PDE isozyme antagonists (group C) (Fig. 4 B). The ex￾tent of staining for platelet-containing antigens (PL-1) was not
different between untreated rats with MSGN (group B: 1.486
0.12, n 5 9) and MSGN rats receiving PDE isozyme inhibitors
(group C: 1.2860.1; n 5 7). Rats with MSGN (group B)
showed de novo expression of a-smooth muscle actin and this
phenotypic change was significantly decreased d 2 46%) in
glomeruli of rats undergoing treatment with the PDE isozyme
antagonists (group C), (Fig. 4 C). Finally, we observed no sta￾tistically significant difference in content of laminin (laminin
staining score) between ATS-injected rats with MSGN receiv￾ing placebo (group B: 2.7360.42, n 5 9) and MSGN animals
treated with LX and RP (group C: 1.7860.47, n 5 7).
The effect of decrease in SBP per se upon development of
MSGN was tested by lowering the SBP by hydralazine, a hy￾potensive drug which has no effect upon PDE activities. Hydra￾lazine administration caused sustained decrease (d < 224%),
in SBP (Fig. 5) in a similar manner and extent as administra￾tion of PDE isozyme antagonists (compare Figs. 2 and 5).
There was no difference between hydralazine-treated MSGN
rats and control MSGN animals in development of proteinuria
(Fig. 5), or other urinary parameters, such as urine flow or UCr:V
(not shown). Immunohistologic analysis (Table II) showed no
significant differences between MSGN rats made hypotensive
by hydralazine and the normotensive controls.
Discussion
The present study was designed to determine whether the anti￾mitogenic effect of PDE-III isozyme antagonists upon MC,
discovered recently in MC cultured in vitro (9) can be elicited

also in vivo and thereby ameliorate the course of MSGN in
rats, namely in the acute proliferative phase of anti-Thy1.1
model (1, 7, 24, 25). We used the potent PDE-III antagonist
lixazinone (LX) together with rolipram (RP), an antagonist of
PDE-IV, which by itself has little anti-mitogenic activity in MC
but which enhances effects of PDE-III antagonists (9). More
importantly, PDE-IV antagonist can also suppress ROM for￾mation in glomeruli (16) and in MC (17) and ROM generated
by infiltrating monocytes (18, 31). Generated ROM may not
only inflict injury to glomerular cells and capillary wall in vivo
(18, 19), but at lower subtoxic concentration may stimulate
MCP-1 synthesis (21) in MC and possibly activate MAPK (32).
Since the available information on the pharmacokinetics of
LX and RP in rats is very limited (22, 23, 27), in the present
study the priming and maintaining doses delivered by osmotic
minipumps were based mainly on the effectiveness of these
agents in vitro (9) and on pilot in vivo studies. We also postu￾lated that the in vivo activity of adenylate cyclase in MC will be
under stimulatory action by circulating hormones and auta￾coids (33, 34). Therefore, lesser concentrations of PDE
isozyme inhibitors would be needed in vivo to achieve the
same degree of in situ PKA activation, inhibition of mitogene￾sis of MC (9), and to decrease ROM formation (16, 17).
The modest but significant increase of cAMP but not
cGMP (Table I) in plasma determined at the end of experi￾ment also confirmed that PDE isozyme antagonists indeed ex￾hibited their expected effect in vivo, i.e. selective inhibition of
cAMP hydrolysis (14, 15). It should be stressed that this mea￾surement reflects the level of circulating extracellular cAMP
and does not reflect the effect of LX or RP upon the cAMP
and cGMP content within the glomeruli or MC.
The moderate (z 19%) drop in SBP observed in rats re￾ceiving PDE isozyme antagonists (Fig. 2) is most likely due to
a decrease in peripheral resistance since PDE-III antagonists
are well known to relax vascular smooth muscle (22). The fact
that this decrease of SBP was of the same extent in 11–15
suggests, indirectly, that the effect of PDE antagonists was
steady, neither cumulative nor underdosed (Fig. 2). Injection
of ATS and development of MSGN per se does not influence
SBP (Fig. 2).
In view of sustained decrease in SBP of otherwise normo￾tensive MSGN rats receiving LX and RP, we investigated
whether such hypotension per se may not ameliorate the de￾velopment of MSGN. The notion that the decrease in SBP per
se does not play a role is supported by results of a control study
(Fig. 5, Table II). Infusion of hydralazine, a vasodilator devoid

of inhibitory effect upon PDE, decreased SBP in a similar
manner as did PDE isozyme antagonists (Fig. 1), but did not
prevent proteinuria, histologic changes, proliferation, and phe￾notype change resulting from ATS injection (Table II and Fig.
5). Thus, lowering of normal SBP per se did not suppress im￾muno-inflammatory injure of glomeruli.
Of major interest was the observation that administration
of LX and RP decreased the number of glomerular cells (Fig. 4
A). In previous studies of anti-Thy-1.1 nephritis double-label￾ing with antibodies against PCNA and Thy-1.1-antigen (1),
showed that the majority (. 85%) of PCNA-positive cells in
the present study are also proliferating MC (26). Concerning
the cellular mechanism by which MC proliferation was ar￾rested in vivo (Fig. 4 A), we surmise that it was caused by acti￾vation of PKA and inhibition of Raf-1 protein kinase—and ul￾timately due to the suppression of MAPK activity (9, 10). It is
now known that other, analogous signaling pathways which
can regulate mitogenesis (35, 36) do not include Raf-1 as a tar￾get for inhibitory action of PKA. In view of this, the present re￾sults strongly suggest that the proposed mitogen-activated sig￾naling pathway and its “negative crosstalk” with cAMP
signaling regulated by PDE-III, at the point of Raf-1 is most
likely a dominant mechanism in control of MC proliferation
(9). Our findings are in agreement with the notion that PDGF,
EGF, and related autacrine/paracrine growth factors play a
key role in pathogenesis of anti-Thy-1.1 MSGN (1, 37). Since
the PDE-III inhibitor ultimately blocks the signaling pathway
at the Raf-1 step, where different types of mitogenesis-activat￾ing signaling pathways converge (10, 38), the employed treat￾ment is suited to block simultaneously the action of a number
of mitogenic stimuli which all contribute to MC proliferation
(10, 12, 38). The possibility that more than one regulatory
pathway was blocked by antagonists of PDE-III and PDE-IV
is also consistent with the observation that the treatment sup￾pressed (d 2 58%) not only the proliferation of MC (Fig. 4 A),
which is known to be PDGF-mediated (37), but also sup￾pressed the activation of MC to express a-actin (Fig. 4 C) (1).
Of importance is also the finding of a decreased accumula￾tion of macrophages in glomeruli of MSGN rats (236%)
treated with PDE isozyme inhibitors (group C) (Fig. 4 B), a
feature not observed in prior studies in which MC prolifera￾tion was inhibited by administration of interferon-g (24) or he￾parin (25). The influx of macrophages into diseased glomeruli
is considered to be an unfavorable factor in the course of hu￾man MSGNs such as IgA nephropathy (31) and, other glomer￾ular diseases (1). Possibly the decreased invasion of macrophages
may be due to an inhibition of chemotactic factors such as
MCP-1 (21). Synthesis of MCP-1 by MC is, according to a re￾cent report, mediated by generation of ROM (21) and, as we
have observed, RP antagonist of PDE-IV, inhibits ROM gen￾eration in glomeruli and MC (16, 17). Thus, administration of
antagonists both of PDE-III and PDE-IV may, via decreasing
synthesis of ROM and MCP-1, cause or contribute to the di￾minished influx of macrophages (Fig. 4 B). Further, it should
be recalled that ROM were shown to activate MAPK (32).

Treatment of Glomerulonephritis with cAMP-Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors 269
Thus, reduction of ROM generation in glomeruli and MC, due
to inhibition of PDE-IV (16, 17), may possibly contribute to
the anti-proliferative effect of PDE-III antagonist. Needless to
say, decreased synthesis of ROM is bound to diminish the ex￾tent of any direct oxidant injury (18, 19) of glomerular cells as
well as blunt the synthesis of chemoattractants (21). Therefore,
administration of antagonists of PDE-III and PDE-IV to￾gether probably inhibits two or more cellular pathogenic pro￾cesses and thereby amplifies the efficacy of suppression of
MSGN with PDE isozyme antagonists.
Our results suggest that the stage of mesangiolysis (day
12) and rapid proliferation of MC up to 15 d in this model of
MSGN has profound impact upon the permselectivity barrier
of capillary walls in glomeruli, as manifested as proteinuria—
the only parameter of renal dysfunction detected in this model
(Fig. 2 and 5), and this was completely prevented/suppressed
by administration of PDE isozyme antagonists (Fig. 2). In
many glomerular diseases associated with MC proliferation,
proteinuria heralds activation of glomerulonephritis and even￾tually progression to renal insufficiency. We surmise that the
novel type of pharmacotherapy with PDE isozyme antagonists
that suppresses both development of proteinuria and acceler￾ated MC proliferation as well as phenotypic transformation,
deserves intense and detailed future studies ultimately for po￾tential clinical use.
It would be indeed premature to conclude at the present,
that the cellular mechanisms which apparently inhibit MC pro￾liferation and decrease macrophage influx in the acute phase
of MSGN administered with antagonists of PDE-III and IV in
vivo, are identical to effects which these antagonists exhibit
upon MC proliferation in vitro (9), generation of ROM (16,
17) and induction of MCP-1 (21). For example, the presence of
platelets apparently plays an important role in very early
phases (1, 8) of development of MSGN elicited by ATS injec￾tion (39) and PDE-III inhibitors are well known to antagonize
platelet aggregation and adhesion (40). It should be thus con￾sidered that some of the observed suppressive effect(s) of
PDE-III isozyme antagonist in vivo upon development of
MSGN reported herein, may be due, at least in part, to its
dampening influence upon platelet functions, although the
finding that the degree of platelet deposition in glomeruli was
not altered by this therapy seems to argue against it (Results).
In any case, the cellular pharmacologic and pathophysiologic
mechanism by which antagonists of PDE isozyme III and IV
exhibited marked suppressive effects upon the development of
the acute phase of MSGN is a subject which deserves carefully
planned and intense future experimental studies, with the
eventual aim to design targeted pharmacotherapy of various
glomerular diseases. It should be stressed that it will be of ma￾jor importance to determine whether PDE isozyme antago￾nists will be able to reverse pathologic changes in already es￾tablished MSGM.
