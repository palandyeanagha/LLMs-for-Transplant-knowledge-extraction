ABSTRACT: Supplementation of formulas with prebiotics enhances
the growth of lactate producing bacteria, and fecal lactate, and acetate
levels in infants. High concentrations of organic acids in intestinal
lumen have, however, been shown to impair the intestinal barrier
function. To determine whether stimulating the colonic microbiotal
metabolism with prebiotics would impair the neonatal intestinal
barrier function, artificially reared rats were fed milk formula with or
without a mixture of galactooligosaccharides/inulin (GOS/Inulin,
88/12; 5.6 g/L) from the 7th d of life (d7) until weaning (d20). At
d18, GOS/inulin supplementation had increased the concentrations of
acetate and lactate in colonic lumen. Although neither ileum￾associated microbiota nor colonic permeability (assessed in Ussing
chambers), nor the expression of tight junction claudin-2 and clau￾din-3 mRNA were altered, GOS/inulin supplementation was associ￾ated with increased bacterial translocation (BT) toward spleen. None
of these effects persisted at d40. We conclude that GOS/inulin
supplementation may increase BT in an immature gut. The balance
between the potential infectious risk of BT vs. its putative beneficial
effect on the maturation of neonatal immune system clearly warrants
further study. (Pediatr Res 64: 34–39, 2008)
As breast-feeding is associated with multiple health bene￾fits, attempts have been made to induce alterations in
intestinal microbiota of formula-fed infants designed to mimic
that observed in breast-fed infants. This has been part of the
rationale for supplementing some infant feeding formulas with
prebiotics, mainly a mixture of galactooligosaccharides (GOS)
and inulin. This GOS/inulin mixture indeed has been shown to
have a prebiotic effect by increasing the proportion of bi￾fidobacteria and lactobacilli in feces [reviewed in (1)], and to
enhance the production of acetate and lactate in the colon of
formula-fed infants, to levels similar to those observed in
breast-fed babies (2). Recent studies found GOS/inulin may
confer protection against infections (3), and decrease the
incidence of atopic dermatitis for babies at risk (4) but the true
benefits of GOS/inulin remain to be clearly established.
As immaturity of the intestinal barrier function is thought to
contribute to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (5),
it is of interest to reinforce the intestinal barrier function of
newborns. Yet, the effect of prebiotic supplementation on
barrier function has largely remained unexplored, with the
exception of a nonrandomized study devoid of control group
(CTL) which reported no impact (6).
Whether prebiotics will impact positively or negatively on
the intestinal barrier function of infants is not predictable from
the literature due to conflicting results.
On the one hand, prebiotics are fermented into short chain
fatty acids (SCFA), particularly butyrate, which plays a key
role in the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis in adult colon
(7), and reduces intestinal permeability and bacterial translo￾cation (BT) in adult rats with experimental colitis (8).
On the other hand, butyrate production appears deleterious
in infants since 1) an over-production of butyrate has been
associated with the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis (9); and
2) colonic perfusion of high concentrations of butyrate (300
mM) induced mucosal damage in pups younger than 20 d of
age (10,11). Such an impact could be considered as irrelevant
since neonatal gut microbiota does not produce butyrate (12),
and therefore prebiotic supplementation solely enhances lac￾tate and acetate production in infants (2). Colonic perfusions
of highly concentrated (300 mM) acetate, however, also
causes mucosal damage in rat pups (10,11) and elevation of
organic acid levels have been linked to the increased incidence
of Salmonella translocation observed in adult rats fed a low￾calcium diet supplemented with prebiotics (13,14).
We therefore speculated that the increased production of
lactate and acetate induced by a supplementation with GOS/
inulin could impair the intestinal barrier function of newborns.
Because of the limitations intrinsic to the study of intestinal
barrier function in human infants, we chose to use the “pup in
the cup” model (15). Newborn rats were artificially reared and
fed a formula with or without a mixture of GOS/inulin from
postnatal day 7 (d7) until weaning (d20). We observed an
increased incidence of BT in rats fed GOS/inulin at d18 and
then evaluated the persistence of this effect (at d40) after
weaning rats with a GOS/inulin-free diet.

METHODS
Animals. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommen￾dations of the local Animal Care and Use Committee of Nantes (France). The
animal facilities were approved by the government agency in charge of
experimental facilities at the French Department of Agriculture, the investi￾gators were accredited by the National Veterinary Agency, and the “pup in the
cup” model was approved as well by a veterinary practitioner from the
National School of Veterinary Medicine. Male newborn rats, originated from
30 pregnant time-dated Sprague-Dawley dams (Elevage Janvier, Le Genest St
Isle, France), were used in three consecutive sets of experiments. Ninety-five
male pups (n  30; n  30; and n  35 in sets no. 1, 2, and 3, respectively)
underwent noninvasive gastrostomy 5 d after delivery (d5) as described
earlier (16). Four times a day, urination and defecation were induced by gentle
stimulation of the anal/genital area of each rat pup. The amount of feces
excreted was evaluated semiquantitatively according to a 0 –3 scale from d7
until d16, at which time the rats were able to defecate alone. During the third
set of experiments, seven male pups from the same litters as gastrostomized
pups and raised by their mother were also included for comparison.
Milk formulas preparation and feeding. The milk formulas were prepared
from powdered rat milk replacer (Wombaroo Food Products, Glen Osmond,
Australia). A total of 10.9 g/L of Vivinal GOS (Friesland Foods Domo,
Zwolle, The Netherlands) i.e., 4.9 g/L of pure GOS and 0.75 g/L of Beneo HP
(Orafti, France) i.e., 0.70 g/L of pure inulin were added to the supplemented
milk formula. Because Vivinal GOS contains up to 23 and 22% of lactose and
glucose, respectively, the control milk formula was supplemented with 2.5
g/L of lactose and 2.4 g/L of glucose. The osmolarities of the two formulas
were comparable (362 vs. 375 mOsml/L; CTL vs. GOS/inulin). During the
first postoperative day, the rats were fed the half strength control milk formula.
On d6, all rats were fed control milk formula. At d7, the rats were randomly
assigned either to the CTL receiving the control milk formula, or to the supple￾mented group (GOS/inulin) receiving the GOS/inulin supplemented milk for￾mula. Every morning, the daily amount of milk formula to be infused was
determined according to the age of the rats (from 3.6 mL at d5 to 15.1 mL at d20).
At d20, the rats were weaned to solid food (D03; Safe, Augy, France) and tap
water. Finally, because of pups mortality or exclusion (see the Result section), and
considering the three sets of experiments in aggregate, a total of 20 and 22 pups
included in the CTL and GOS/inulin, respectively, were anesthetized with
isoflurane at d18, and killed by decapitation; 14 and 14 rats from CTL and
GOS/inulin were also killed at d40 by CO2 inhalation. During the third set of
experiments, the seven rats raised by their mothers were also killed at d18.
Bacterial translocation and ileum-associated microbiota. Immediately
after killing (d18: n  20 CTL, n  22 GOS/inulin and n  7 mother-reared
rats; d40: n  14 CTL and GOS/inulin), the spleen was excised using sterile
procedure, weighed, and ground in sterile Ringer with a pellet pistol. Five
centimeter of distal ileum were also excised (d18: n  8 CTL, n  10
GOS/inulin and n  7 mother-reared rats), weighed, rinsed consecutively in
three sterile saline baths and ground in sterile Ringer with a pellet pistol.
Hundred microliters of the homogenate and of 10-fold serial dilutions in
Ringer were plated onto four separate plates (Biokar diagnostic, Beauvais,
France) that included Nutrient Agar and MacConkey media incubated in
aerobic conditions, Wilkins and Chalgren and MRS agar incubated in anaer￾obic conditions (N2/CO2/H2:85/10/5). After 24 to 96 h of incubation, the
number of colony-forming units (CFUs) per plate was counted. The total
number of CFUs per spleen (BT intensity) or per gram of ileum was
calculated. Growth in spleen was considered positive if greater than 30
CFUs/spleen were identified. BT incidence was defined as the percentage of
rats that presented a positive bacterial culture in spleen.
Colonic permeability in Ussing chambers. Immediately after killing, ce￾cum, proximal, and distal colons (d18: n  18, d40: n  14) were weighed,
removed, and opened along the mesenteric border into a flat sheet. Tissues were
rinsed in modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer (Sigma-Aldrich Chimie Sarl, St
Quentin Fallavier, France), and mounted in Ussing chambers (Physiologic
Instruments, San Diego, CA) less than 20 min after killing, exposing 0.25 cm2
to 1 mL of circulating oxygenated Krebs buffer at 38°C. After 20 min,
FITC-labeled 4-KDa dextran (Sigma-Aldrich Chimie Sarl, St Quentin Falla￾vier, France) was added at the mucosal side (4.4 mg/mL final concentration)
and fluorescence was measured at the serosal side after 120 min. Fluxes of
FITC-Dextran were expressed as g/h/cm2
. The surface areas (n  12 per
group) of the entire colon and that of the entire cecum were measured as the
surfaces of a trapezoid of a quadrilateral, respectively.
Luminal organic acids concentration in the colon. At d18 (n  20 CTL,
n  22 GOS/inulin), the luminal contents from the cecum and the colon were
pooled together; at d40 (n  14 per group), the cecal content alone was
analyzed. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) analysis was performed by capillary
gas chromatography [adapted from Ref. (17)] on supernatant of samples
diluted in oxalic acid and centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min. D-lactate, L-lactate
concentrations were determined using an assay kit according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions (Biosentec, Toulouse, France). Results were expressed as
mol of organic acid/g of luminal content.
Reverse-transcription PCR. Samples (10 –20 mg) of distal colon (d18:
n  12 per group) were rinsed in sterile saline, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at 70°C until analysis. Tissue RNA was extracted with the
NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macheray-Nagel EURL, Hoerdt, France) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 g of total RNA
in 25 L final volume using random primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase
(Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real￾time PCR was performed in the presence of 150 ng of cDNA in final volume
of 15 L containing 250 nmol/L of each specific primer using QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Amplification (45
cycles: 30 s at 95°C and 10 s at 60°C) was performed with the iCycler iQ
real-time PCR detection system instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). Sequences and PCR efficiency of primers are stated in Table 1. Results
were expressed relative to GAPDH gene expression compared with the CTL,
according to the 2Ct (where Ct is the cycle threshold) calculation method,
taking into account the efficiency of the primers if not 100%.
Histomorphometry. Shortly after killing, cecal and distal colonic mucosa
(d18: n  12 per group) opened longitudinally were rinsed with sterile 0.9%
saline, and rolled around a wooden stick as described by the ‘Swiss roll’
technique (18). Sections (5 m) of formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded
tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and observed by light
microscopy. For each tissue, the length and height of 10 crypts at two different
spots and the thickness of the nonepithelial layer (sub-mucosa  muscularis 
serosa) at 10 spots were recorded. The mean values of the 10 measurements
for each rat were used for statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis. Values are given as medians (or absolute values for
BT incidence) and the interquartile ranges (Q1–Q3) are parenthesized. Sta￾tistics were done using Statview v.2. The effect of GOS/inulin supplementa￾tion was analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test. During the third set of
experiments, differences between mother reared rats and the two groups of
artificially reared pups were first analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test, then
by pair with Mann-Whitney test. Statistical analysis of BT was performed
with the 2 test. Differences were considered statistically significant when
p-value  0.05.
RESULTS
Rat pup growth. Fifteen of the 95 rats had to be excluded
from the experiments since they pulled out their cannula,
and three rats from the GOS/inulin group (GOS/In) died at
11, 14, and 17 d of life without any obvious reason, and
while their cannulas were in place. 2 Analysis did not

reveal any statistical difference in mortality between the
two groups (p  0.08).
As the same pump was used to deliver both formulas, milk
intake was similar between GOS/inulin and CTL. Weight gain
between d5 and d18 [19.1 (3.1) g vs. 18.5 (3.6) g], body
weight [34.7 (2.7) g vs. 33.5 (3.9) g], and body length [17.3
(1.0) cm vs. 17.0 (0.5) cm] at d18 were similar in CTL and
GOS/inulin.
Weights of the brain, liver, spleen, pancreas, lungs, and
femur did not differ between the two experimental regimens
(data not shown). A small, although not significant, increase
(6%) in length of the entire small intestine (p  0.09) and of
the entire colon (p  0.12) was observed in GOS/inulin,
compared with CTL (data not shown).
Trophic effect of GOS/inulin on large intestine. At d18,
the surface area and weight of ceca were 1.7 and 1.5 times
greater (p  0.02 and p  0.0001, respectively) in GOS/inulin
than in CTL (Fig. 1A and B) but the weight/surface ratio was
not different. The weight and surface area of the colon did not
differ between the two experimental regimens. The increased
weight and surface of the cecum of 18d-old rats did not last
through d40 (weight: 1.3 (0.8) vs. 1.4 (0.5) g; surface: 8.5 (1.6)
vs. 9.0 (2.5) cm2
; for CTL and GOS/inulin, respectively).
The height and width of cecal and colonic crypts, as well as
the thickness of the nonepithelial layer did not differ among
the two groups at d18 (data not shown).
Effect of GOS/inulin on colonic microbiota metabolism.
Stool emission (number and volume of stools per day) was
increased in GOS/inulin, compared with CTL (p  0.05),
from d9 to d15 (Table 2), and feces of GOS/inulin were noted
to be softer than those from CTL (results not shown). The total
amount of luminal contents in the cecum and colon from
GOS/inulin was also 1.6 times heavier, compared with CTL,
at d18 (Table 2; p  0.02).
The concentrations of total lactate and of total SCFA were
1.6 and 1.2 times higher (p  0.009 and p  0.01), respec￾tively, in GOS/inulin compared with CTL. Only L-lactate
concentration was significantly increased in GOS/inulin com￾pared with CTL (Table 2). Median D-lactate concentrations
were below the limit of quantification of the assay. Among
SCFA, only acetate (representing 90% of total SCFA in both
groups) concentration was significantly increased (Table 2).
The enhanced production of acetate observed in the GOS/
inulin, compared with CTL, did not last through d40.
Effect of GOS/inulin on intestinal barrier function. Con￾sidering all three experiments in aggregate at d18, incidence of
BT was higher in GOS/inulin compared with CTL, both for
aerobes and anaerobes (Fig. 2A; p  0.02 and p  0.005,
respectively). However, the number of aerobes and anaerobes
found in the spleen (i.e., BT intensity) did not differ between
CTL and GOS/In (2.0 vs. 2.2 log10 and 2.0 vs. 2.4 log10 CFUs;
respectively). BT incidence and intensity was similar in CTL
and GOS/inulin for lactic acid producing bacteria and enter￾obacteria (Fig. 2A). The increase in BT incidence observed in
GOS/inulin was not observed anymore at d40 (Fig. 2A).
Data from the sole third set of experiments (where mother￾reared pups were included) were consistent with these trends
at d18 (Table 3) but also emphasized that BT was specifically
increased by GOS/inulin supplementation. Indeed, BT was not
increased in CTL artificially reared pups compared with
mother reared pups (p  0.60) but was increased in GOS/
inulin compared with both CTL and mother-reared pups (p 
0.02 and p  0.03 respectively, Table 3).
The paracellular permeability to macromolecules (flux of 4
KDa Dextran measured in Ussing chambers) did not differ
between GOS/inulin and CTL in cecum, proximal or distal
colon at d18 and d40 (Fig. 2B). Besides, at d18, the colonic
expression of the genes encoding for tight junction proteins

claudin-2 and claudin-3, relative to GAPDH expression, were
not altered by dietary GOS/inulin (claudin-2: 0.86 (1.11) vs.
0.73 (0.26); claudin-3: 0.89 (0.54) vs. 0.68 (1.20) for CTL and
GOS/in, respectively). The expression of ZO-1, however, was
40% lower in the GOS/inulin compared with CTL [0.59 (0.11)
vs. 0.93(0.67), respectively; p  0.02].
Ileal mucosa-associated bacteria. Numbers of ileal mucosa￾associated aerobes, anaerobes, lactic acid producing bacteria,
and enterobacteria in the ileum were not different between
GOS/inulin and CTL (Table 3). However, the number of ileal
mucosa-associated enterobacteria in mother-reared rats was
significantly lower, compared with both CTL and GOS/inulin
(Table 3).
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates that in neonatal rat receiv￾ing enteral nutrition, supplementation with a mixture of GOS/
inulin 1) enhances fecal excretion, and luminal concentrations
of L-lactate and acetate in the large intestine, 2) exerts a
trophic effect on cecal mucosa, and 3) increases BT toward
spleen. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the
first to demonstrate such an impact which has potentially
important implications as the potential risks and benefits of
increased BT remain to be explored.
In view of the literature, increased BT following supple￾mentation with prebiotics in the neonatal period was not
unexpected. As a matter of fact, an increased translocation of
Salmonella toward spleen was reported in adult rats fed a
low-calcium diet enriched with fructooligosaccharides or in￾ulin when animals were infected with this pathogen (13,19).
The authors hypothesized that the rapid fermentation of the
prebiotics led to high ceco-colonic concentrations of organic
acids that impaired the intestinal barrier function. Consistent
with the latter hypothesis, the increased BT observed in the
current study was concomitant with a rise in the concentration
of organic acids in the ceco-colonic luminal content in rats fed
GOS/inulin. Furthermore, regardless of regimen, the concen￾tration of total organic acids was significantly higher in rats
displaying BT, compared with rats without BT [87.2 (26.2) vs.
69.8 (26.5) mol/g, respectively; p  0.01].
Whether these concentrations of organic acids can impair
the barrier function is debatable since Lin et al. showed that in
situ perfusions of 300 mM of SCFA, but not 150 mM, induced
colonic mucosal damage in newborn rats (10). In the current
study, the mean concentration of organic acids in pooled
ceco-colonic content at d18 never exceeded 150 mol/g but 1)
the concentration of organic acids was probably higher in the
cecum (i.e., the major fermentation site for oligosaccharides in
rodent) than in the colon, and 2) luminal SCFA concentrations
only partially reflect SCFA production because of absorption.
So it cannot be excluded that higher concentrations— close to
those able to produce mucosal lesion—were reached at some
point in time in the cecum or colon of our supplemented pups.
However, other findings argue against the hypothesis of a
“toxic” mucosal injury mediated by organic acids. First,
whereas the enhanced BT associated with fructooligosaccha￾rides and inulin supplementation in adult rats was dependent
on calcium deficiency (19), our rats were fed a normal￾calcium diet. Moreover, in the current study and conversely to
Ten Bruggencate and coworkers (13,14), GOS/inulin supple￾mentation altered neither the histologic characteristics of ce￾cum and colon (data not shown) nor the permeability of cecum
and colon to 4 KDa dextran. Although colonic permeability
was measured across unstripped intestinal walls, it is unlikely
that the underlying muscle layers have masked differences in
the permeability across the epithelium per se since the flux of

PREBIOTICS AND NEONATAL INTESTINAL BARRIER 37

4 KDa probes is not altered by these layers in distal colon of
adult rabbit (20). We also failed to detect any alteration in the
colonic expression of genes encoding for claudin-2 and clau￾din-3, two proteins that are constitutive of tight junctions, and
presumably form the pores that regulate paracellular pathway
(21). Conversely, we detected a small significant downregu￾lation of ZO-1 mRNA expression, but earlier studies suggest
that deletion of ZO-1 is not associated to altered paracellular
permeability (22). Taken together and subject to confirmation
by in vivo measurement of permeability, these results suggest
that the increased BT we observed was not induced by alter￾ations in the ceco-colonic permeability.
The increased BT detected in the GOS/inulin group may
have originated from the small intestine, rather than colon.
Two lines of evidence, possibly interconnected, support such
a hypothesis. First, animal studies suggest that BT in newborn
is largely related to the colonization of small intestine rather
than colon (23). Whether excessive small intestinal prolifera￾tion of luminal microbiota occurred in our study following
GOS/inulin supplementation could not be verified due to the
insufficient mass of intestinal contents. However, we did not
observe any difference in ileal mucosa associated microbiota
between the two regimens, which argues against this hypoth￾esis. Second, the ileal associated lymphoid tissue, rich in M
cells that are known pathways for BT, is potentially respon￾sive to prebiotics. Interaction between prebiotics and immune
cells relies on several mechanisms including local or systemic
indirect effects mediated by enhanced production of immuno￾regulatory SCFA or a shift in the composition of the intestinal
microbiota, or direct effect mediated via carbohydrate recep￾tors (24). In the current study, an indirect effect through
enhanced production of SCFA or changes in the microbiotal
composition is unlikely in the small intestine since transit in
this segment, which is very fast in newborn rats (25), is hardly
compatible with significant fermentation. Moreover, approxi￾mately 90% of an ingested dose of fructooligosaccharides and
inulin have been shown to reach the colon of humans and/or
animals (26). It is therefore tempting to speculate that modu￾lation of the ileal-associated lymphoid tissue by GOS/inulin
might account for the increased BT in the current study.
Putative mechanisms include either a direct local effect via
carbohydrate receptors, or a systemic one, through fermenta￾tion of prebiotics in the large intestine.
Regardless of the mechanism underlying this increased BT,
it raises the question of the safety of the GOS/inulin for
newborn infants. The consequences of BT on the host health
are not fully understood. BT has long been considered detri￾mental, particularly in preterm infants, as it has been directly
involved in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis,
along with several other factors (27). Yet, until now, supple￾mentation of infant formulas with GOS/inulin has not been
associated with adverse effects in full-term nor in preterm
infants (28). If an increased BT associated to the supplemen￾tation of GOS/inulin were to be confirmed in infants, this
effect might not necessarily be harmful. Indeed, in neonatal
animals (29), as well as in human infants (30), a high inci￾dence of BT has been reported to occur naturally, without any
obvious adverse consequences. Since the occurrence of BT
paralleled the development of the gut-associated lymphoid
tissue, the authors speculated that BT could be involved in the
postnatal maturation of the immune system.
In conclusion, using an animal model of artificial feeding
we demonstrate that feeding with a GOS/inulin-enriched for￾mula in the neonatal period enhances the metabolic activity of
colonic microbiota, as observed in human infants (2), and
increases BT toward spleen at d18 as well. This effect did not
persist at d40, after 20 d of weaning with a normal, prebiotic￾free, solid diet. The mechanisms underlying this increased BT
are unclear, and do not reflect any obvious alteration in
colonic barrier function. Further investigation of the effect of
GOS/inulin on the small intestinal immune system is war￾ranted to establish whether this stimulation of BT is beneficial
to the maturation of the immune system.
