Pneumocystis is an unusual fungus that is a prototypical
opportunistic pathogen, causing an asymptomatic or mild
infection in the normal host but fulminate pneumonia (PcP) in
the immunocompromised host. Untreated, the mortality rate from
PcP approaches 100%. Even with treatment, mortality rates
approach 10–20%. It is a ubiquitous organism infecting a wide
array of mammalian species. Although the reservoir of infection
for Pneumocystis has not been defined, direct airborne transmission
from host to host has been proven under experimental conditions
using the rat model of PcP [1]. This synopsis will review the
evidence suggesting that the reservoir of infection for humans with
PcP is other humans, possibly infants and young children.
The study of Pneumocystis has been problematic due to the
inability to cultivate the organism or manipulate its cellular or
molecular characteristics. As recently as the 1970s, a student
studying Pneumocystis would have come away with the following
understanding of its basic biology and function as a pathogen:
Pneumocystis is an organism of low virulence found in many
mammalian species. In humans, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) is a
zoonosis resulting from reactivation of a latent infection acquired
early in life. This concept of Pneumocystis arose largely through
analogy to existing knowledge about other organisms to explain
clinical observations, rather than through direct experimentation
on the organism. Over the past 25 years, we have learned more
about Pneumocystis through controlled studies that have corrected
some of the misconceptions contained in the ‘‘old’’ concept of
Pneumocystis contagion stated above. What follows is a brief
summary of key research observations that give us a better, yet
still incomplete, understanding of how Pneumocystis maintains its
existence as an opportunistic pathogen.
Pneumocystis Is Not a Zoonosis
In order for Pneumocystis to be classified a zoonosis it would need
to be transmissible from one host species to another. This was
originally suspected for Pneumocystis because human and rodent
Pneumocystis appeared visually similar following histochemical
staining procedures. However with the advent of monoclonal
antibodies, it was possible to show that Pneumocystis from one host
species was phenotypically distinct from Pneumocystis from a
different host [2]. Soon thereafter this phenotypic variation was
confirmed at the genetic level [3–5].
Experiments that directly assessed the ability of Pneumocystis to
move between species were published in 1993. This study
demonstrated that Pneumocystis could not be transmitted between
mice and ferrets [6]. This observation was soon followed by similar
results that showed Pneumocystis from rabbits, rats, monkeys, and
humans were not infectious for mice [reviewed in 7]. Thus,
available data indicates that each mammalian species that
contracts PcP has its own strain or species of Pneumocystis.
Pneumocystis Does Not Establish Latency under
Laboratory Conditions
To experimentally address the issue of latency, severe
combined immunodeficiency disease (scid) mice were allowed to
develop active PcP prior to restoration of their immune system by
adoptive transfer of normal spleen cells. Immune-reconstituted
mice recovered from PcP through an immune response without
the use of antibiotics. Pneumocystis was cleared from the lung and
could not be detected by three weeks post-reconstitution. To
determine if the mice remained latently infected, they were again
immunosuppressed and observed for up to 84 days for
reactivation of PcP, which did not occur [8]. Similar results,
using a somewhat different approach in rats, were obtained by
Vargas et al. [9]. Thus, normal immune mechanisms are
sufficient to clear Pneumocystis after infection such that latency is
unlikely.
Support for the concept that PcP in adults is a result of recent
acquisition of Pneumocystis, rather than reactivation of a latent
infection, comes from analysis of second episodes of PcP. Keely et
al. were able to show that episodes of PcP occurring more than six
months apart were caused by genetically distinct strains of
Pneumocystis [10]. Furthermore, genetic typing of Pneumocystis
isolates from human patients demonstrated that the genotype of
the organism causing disease was associated with the patient’s
place of residence rather than place of birth [11].
Pneumocystis Infects the Normal Host, Producing a
Typical Pattern of Contagion Followed by
Immune Response and Clearance
To characterize the course of infection in the normal host, we
exposed immunocompetent mice to scid mice with active PcP
[12]. The normal mice developed a productive infection with
growth of organisms through week four, at which time
Pneumocystis-specific antibodies appeared in the serum in associ￾ation with complete clearance of organisms. However, normal
mice with this self-limited mild infection were able to transmit
Pneumocystis to another normal mouse, thereby serving to
maintain Pneumocystis in the environment. Alternatively, if the
infected normal mouse encountered an immunosuppressed host,
full-blown PcP resulted [13,14]. Thus the normal host could serve
as a reservoir to maintain Pneumocystis in any given mammalian
population.

Asymptomatic or Subclinical Infection of Human
Infants is Common
It has been long known that low titers of antibody to
Pneumocystis are common in humans. The role of young children
in the contagion cycle was suggested by the observation that
Pneumocystis was frequently found in the lungs of infants dying of
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in Santiago, Chile;
Oxford, England; Rochester, New York; and Connecticut
[15,16]. While it was initially postulated that Pneumocystis was
somehow contributing to SIDS, examination of the lung
histology of infants dying of SIDS and who were also infected
with Pneumocystis revealed very few organisms and no evidence
of an inflammatory reaction. Additional studies do not support
any causative role for Pneumocystis in SIDS [17]. They do,
however, support the concept that infection of infants is
common. These findings are consistent with the findings
reported for normal mice infected with Pneumocystis discussed
above and are also consistent with studies by Garvy et al.,
which demonstrate that neonatal mice are highly susceptible to
infection with Pneumocystis [18].
To better understand the kinetics of infection, we carried out a
prospective study of primary infection in 107 infants in Santiago,
Chile. Infants were tested for the presence of serum antibody to
Pneumocystis at birth and every two months thereafter for two years.
Nasopharyngeal aspirates were also examined for Pneumocystis by
PCR during respiratory illnesses. At two months of age, 16% were
seropositive and seroconversion occurred at a rate of approxi￾mately 5% per month. By 20 months of age, 85% of the cohort of
infants had seroconverted. Seventy-four infants were screened for
Pneumocystis DNA and 32% were positive [19]. Given that the peak
age for SIDS overlaps with the peak time of seroconversion, the
presence of Pneumocystis in the lungs of SIDS cases is likely
coincidental.
Infants and Children Are a Pneumocystis￾Susceptible Population That Could Serve as an
Important Reservoir for Maintaining Pneumocystis
in the Environment
By extending the experimental observations made in animal
models of PcP to the epidemiologic observations in infants, one
can envision that infants serve to harbor Pneumocystis with little
adverse effect on the host. Once infected, an infant could then pass
on the infection to another host, either normal or immunocom￾promised. Resistance to reinfection is of unknown duration but
would be compensated for by new births that would serve to
maintain a pool of susceptible hosts. As depicted in Figure 1,
circulation in the healthy population would result in subclinical or
mild infection. It is quite possible that one of the multitude of
‘‘viral illnesses’’ occurring within the first two years of life is
actually an infection with Pneumocystis. When an immunocompro￾mised host enters the cycle, the result is active PcP. The
compromised host can then spread infection to a compromised
patient, as has been suggested by clinic ‘‘outbreaks’’ [20], or back
to a normal individual where it can maintain a quasi-symbiotic
relationship of limited duration with its human host. Studies have
not been done to determine the frequency with which normal
older children and adults become infected, so we don’t know
whether older children and adults also serve as a significant
reservoir of infection. However, Pneumocystis DNA has been found
in oral washes from adult patients [21].
So where does Pneumocystis live? Given what we have learned in
the past two decades, the most likely answer to this question is: It
lives in us. Our concept of Pneumocystis should now read:
Pneumocystis is a classic opportunistic pathogen that causes little
or no disease after infecting a normal host, while infection of the
immunocompromised host results in a uniformly fatal pneumonia
if untreated. Each susceptible mammalian species is infected by a
Figure 1. Proposed transmission cycle for Pneumocystis based on the normal host, likely infants, serving as the reservoir of
infection.

unique strain or species of Pneumocystis, but the basis for the host￾species specificity remains a mystery. In man, the organism is
spread from person to person, and PcP is most likely the result of
recent acquisition of Pneumocystis rather than reactivation of a
latent infection. The ubiquitous presence of Pneumocystis through￾out the population likely explains why this organism is so adept at
‘‘finding’’ immunocompromised patients and suggests that more
widespread use of immunomodulatory therapies will increase the
risk of developing PcP. Understanding this aspect of the biology of
Pneumocystis will aid in developing means to prevent PcP.
