Background: Maintenance of the adequate intraoperative renal perfusion is very important during Orthotopic Liver Transplantation 
(OLT) to prevent acute renal failure.
Objectives: For the first time, this study was designed to survey the effects of octreotide on urine output during anesthesia for OLT and 
early postoperative renal function.
Patients and Methods: In this randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial, 79 of 89 patients who underwent OLT and 
fulfilled the study requirement were randomly allocated into two groups. In the octreotide group, the patients received octreotide 
infusion from the start of the operation. On the other hand, the control group patients received physiologic saline infusion instead of 
octreotide. The Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), heart rate, urine output, norepinephrine usage, and dosage during the three stages of OLT, 
and baseline and postoperative creatinine were recorded and compared between the two groups.
Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding the demographic characteristics and graft factors 
(P > 0.05). However, urine output and MAP during the three stages of OLT were significantly higher in the octreotide group compared 
to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding baseline as well as 
postoperative creatinine (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: The results demonstrated that octreotide infusion during anesthesia for OLT not only augmented the vasoconstriction 
effect of norepinephrine to increase MAP, but also maintained better renal perfusion and urine output during the operation.

Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the sole and final treatment for end-stage liver disease.Acute renal failure (ARF) is common complication dur￾ing OLT and unfortunately this ARF increase mortality and morbidity following OLT. For preventing ARF,maintaining renal function during OLT is very 
important .The results of this research help anesthesiologists to manage kidney perfusion and renal function during orthotopic liver transplantation.

1. Background
Acute renal insufficiency is one of the most serious com￾plications following Orthotopic Liver Transplantation 
(OLT) (1-3). The incidence of acute renal insufficiency after 
OLT varies from 25% to 70% in different centers due to us￾ing different diagnostic methods (4, 5). Previous studies 
showed that the mortality rate following OLT was two 
times more in patients who developed ARF compared to 
those without ARF (5, 6). ARF has been shown to be more 
common among the OLT patients with a higher preoper￾ative serum creatinine (Cr) level, greater need for blood 
transfusions during the operation, and more episodes 
of hypotension during the operation (5-7). Anesthesiolo￾gists have to be responsible for maintaining stable hemo￾dynamic status intraoperatively to preserve renal perfu￾sion and urine output (8).
One of the important causes of renal hypo-perfusion is 
splanchnic vasodilation with subsequent intrarenal va￾soconstriction which is usually detected in patients with 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension (9, 10). Therefore, to 
maintain renal perfusion, we should increase splanchnic 
vascular tone with vasoconstrictor (11-13). Some studies 
have suggested vasopressin as a splanchnic vasoconstric￾tor, but severe ischemic complications have made vaso￾pressin unfavorable (13, 14). The acute administration of 
vasopressin analogues, such as terlipress or ornipressin, 
is still controversial (15, 16). On the other hand, in patients 
with cirrhosis, lack of response to vasoconstrictors, such 
as norepinephrine, in the splanchnic area is due to the in￾creased level of both endothelial (nitric oxide) and non￾endothelial vasodilators (glucagon) (15).

Octreotide is an inhibitor of the releasing vasodilator 
peptides, such as glucagon and vasoactive intestinal pep￾tide (15). Some animal studies have shown that octreotide 
decreases the level of glucagon, eventually improving 
the vasoconstrictors effect of norepinephrine in patients 
with cirrhosis (17). However, its use during general anes￾thesia for OLT has not been reported in the literature.
2. Objectives
This randomized double blind clinical trial was de￾signed to evaluate the effect of combination of octreotide 
and norepinephrine on urine output and early postoper￾ative renal function in the patients undergoing deceased 
OLT.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Ethical Considerations
This study was approved by our institutional ethics 
committee. The purpose of the study was explained to 
the patients and their families, and written informed 
consents were obtained.
3.2. Subjects
The eligible patients were all adults aging 16 years and 
above. They were candidates for orthotopic deceased do￾nor liver transplantation from September 2011 to April 
2012 in Shiraz Organ Transplantation Center. The exclu￾sion criteria of the study were ischemic heart disease, sys￾temic hypertension, renal failure, heart block, diabetes 
mellitus, and surgical techniques other than piggyback.
3.3. Study Design
This single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel- groups clinical trial with balanced randomiza￾tion (IRCT 2012120411662N1) was conducted in Iran. The 
patients were randomly assigned to two parallel groups 
to receive either norepinephrine alone or a combination 
of norepinephrine and octreotide.
3.4. Outcome Measures
The primary outcome with respect to the efficacy of oc￾treotide in maintaining renal blood flow perfusion was 
the urine output measurement during the three stages 
of the operation. Yet, the secondary outcome was serum 
creatinine measured by jaffe/kinetic method on the 1st 
and 3rd days post operation.
3.5. Sample Size Calculation
We did not find any trials regarding the use of octreotide 
during anesthesia for liver transplantation in the review 
of the literature to calculate the sample size therefore, we 
recruited all the eligible patients from September 2011 to 
April 2012. Among eighty nine patients with end-stage 
liver disease candidates for orthotropic deceased donor 
liver transplantation during this period, just seventy 
nine patients fulfilled the study requirements.
3.6. Randomization
The patients were randomly assigned to the two study 
groups through simple randomization using computer￾ized random numbers. Each of the patients with a 1:1 ra￾tio was allocated to the octreotide or the control group. A 
nurse anesthetist who was not involved in data collection 
and treatment performed the patients' enrollment and 
assignment into the treatment groups.
3.7. Intervention
Anesthesia was induced with thiopental (5mg/Kg), 
fentanyl (2μg/Kg), and midazolam (0.03mg/Kg), and 
pancuronium (0.1 mg/Kg) was used for neuromuscular 
blockade. In addition, ventilation was maintained by 50% 
air-50% oxygen mixture plus isoflurane. Cardiovascular 
function was monitored by electrocardiogram, radial ar￾tery catheter, and the Central Venous Pressure (CVP) via 
the right internal jugular vein through the double lumen 
central venous access line. Besides, hepatectomy was per￾formed for all the patients by using the piggy-back tech￾nique.
The octreotide and placebo (normal saline) were in 50 
ml syringes which were identical in appearance. They 
were prepared by a nurse anesthetist who was not par￾ticipating in the study. The 50 ml syringes with A label 
contained 50 microgram octreotide diluted with normal 
saline in the total volume of 50 ml, while the 50 ml sy￾ringes with B label contained just 50 ml normal saline. 
The patients and the research assessor were not aware of 
the contents of the syringes A and B.
In the octreotide group, after induction of anesthesia, 
octreotide was started with 50 microgram dosage in 50 
ml syringes intravenously (IV) in 15 minutes followed by 
50 microgram per hour in 50 ml syringes with A label. In 
the control group, on the other hand, normal saline in 50 
ml syringes with B label was started. In both groups, 5% 
albumin and fresh frozen plasma were administrated to 
maintain the CVP at ≥ 10 cmH2O. In case the Mean Blood 
Pressure (MAP) dropped to less than 60 mmHg, the pa￾tients were given norepinephrine as a vasoconstrictor 
with an initial dose of 0.05 μg /kg/min. The dosage was 
increased until the MAP was maintained at more than 60 
mmHg.
3.8. Study Measurements
Hepatectomy phase was defined from the beginning 
of the operation up to clamping the inferior vena cava 
and portal vein. In addition, an-hepatic phase started 
from clamping the inferior vena cava and portal vein and 
liver removal up to the declamping of the inferior vena

cava and portal vein. Finally, neo-hepatic phase began by 
declamping of the inferior vena cava and portal vein and 
reperfusion of the new liver up to the end of the opera￾tion.
The cold ischemic time was defined as the period from 
aortic cross-clamping and perfusion with the preserva￾tion solutions in the donor up to the time the liver was 
taken out from cold preservative fluid. From this time, 
warm ischemic time was started and continued up to the 
completion of the anastomosis and portal reperfusion. 
Thus, the total ischemic time was calculated as the peri￾od from the aortic cross-clamping and perfusion with the 
preservative solutions in the donor up to the completion 
of the anastomosis and portal reperfusion.
The hemodynamic parameters; i.e., MAP, heart rate, 
central venous pressure of the patients, and dosage of 
norepinephrine, which were used to maintain MAP ≥ 60 
mmHg were recorded during the three stages of trans￾plantation. Furthermore, the patients' urine output (ml/
kg/hr) was recorded at the end of each stage of the liver 
transplantation and their serum creatinine was recorded 
on the first and 3rd days of the operation. Also, the pa￾tients were followed for using Chronic Renal Replace￾ment Therapy (CRRT) until 5 days post operation.
3.9. Statistical Analysis
The analyses were performed by using the SPSS statisti￾cal software, 18.0 (Statistic package for Mac OS X version). 
Repeated measures analysis of variance was used for 
intergroup comparison of hemodynamic parameters. 
In addition, unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was 
used for continuous variables, and χ2 test was used for 
categorical ones. All values were presented as means ± SD 
or median (interquartile), and P < 0.05 was considered as 
statistically significant.
4. Results
4.1. The Enrolled Patients
Among 89 patients who underwent OLT from Septem￾ber 2011 to April 2012, seventy nine ones fulfilled the study 
requirement. They were randomly allocated into control 
(n = 39) and octreotide groups (n = 40). Exclusion crite￾ria were diabetes mellitus (n = 2) and surgical technique 
other than piggy back (n = 8) (Figure 1). 
4.2. Medication Adverse Effects and Complications
An independent senior attending reviewed the unblind￾ed data for patient safety. Also, he followed the patients in 
the octreotide group during the trial for recording the 
possible octreotide complications. However, no changes 
occurred in the study method after the trial commence￾ment. 
4.3. Study Findings
The demographic variables including sex, age, Meld 
score, baseline creatinine, and volume of ascites fluid 
are summarized in Table 1. No significant differences 
were found between the two groups regarding the demo￾graphic variables (P > 0.05). Besides, no significant differ￾ence was observed between the control and octreotide 
groups regarding the graft factors (P > 0.05) (Table 2). The 
two groups were also similar concerning the duration of 
the operation, cold and warm ischemic times, and total 
ischemic time (P > 0.05) (Table 2).

5. Discussion
The results of this study revealed two interesting points 
in management of anesthesia for OLT. First, the combina￾tion of octreotide and norepinephrine has a major con￾tribution to preserving renal perfusion and urine output 
during the operation. Second, this combination leads to 
maintenance of better MAP during anesthesia. The ratio￾nale for using octreotide in this study depends on the hy￾pothesis that splanchnic vasodilatation in patients with 
cirrhosis is the primary event leading to systemic hypo￾volemia, and renal artery vasoconstriction subsequently 
decreasing the glomerular filtration rate (18). Due to the 
fact that urine output is the main monitoring of renal 
perfusion during anesthesia, it was used as a marker of 
renal perfusion during anesthesia for OLT in this study. 
However, postoperative serum creatinine was used as a 
marker of postoperative renal function.
Anesthesiologists usually use vasopressin or its ana￾logues as a splanchnic vasoconstrictor to maintain renal 
function during the perioperative period of OLT. Howev￾er, a recent animal study showed that vasopressin might 
cause ischemic necrosis with the infusion dose ≥ 0.04 U/
min; therefore, vasopressin is not a safe drug. Moreover, 
vasopressin analogues, which are safer than vasopressin, 
are not available in many countries (17).
Nonetheless, two uncontrolled studies showed that oc￾treotide in combination with α agonist agent midodrine 
or alone was an effective splanchnic vasoconstrictor to re￾store the renal function in patients with cirrhosis (15, 19). 
Of course, just five patients were enrolled into each study 
and both studies were nonrandomized. On the other 
hand, our study was randomized and double-blind, and 
was performed on a larger sample size, which are consid-

Sahmeddini MA et al.

ered as the positive points of this study.
Kiser et al. showed that octreotide monotherapy was 
not effective in renal hemodynamic maintenance and 
restoration of renal function (20). Also, Pomier-Layrar￾gues et al. showed that using octreotide alone did not 
have any effects on splanchnic vasculature and renal 
function (21). It is obvious that octreotide monotherapy 
does not affect splanchnic vasculature and renal func￾tion because octreotide is not a direct vasoconstrictor. As 
a matter of fact, octreotide has vasodilatation-inhibitory 
effects by inhibiting the release of glucagon. Therefore, 
octreotide was used in this study to augment the effect of 
norepinephrine as an α agonist agent.
Pomier-Layrargues et al. in their study demonstrated 
that octreotide needed at least 48 hours to start its ef￾fect on the renal function parameters, and the best re￾sult could be observed after 4-8 days (21). However, the 
hemodynamic effects of this drug on splanchnic and 
renal circulation are usually induced in a shorter period 
of time. Therefore, the higher urine output in the octreo￾tide group during the three stages of OLT in the present 
study showed the hemodynamic effects of octreotide on 
renal and splanchnic circulation. On the other hand, no 
significant difference was found between the two groups 
regarding serum creatinine as a renal function marker 
because octreotide was just used during the operation 
time.
In our study, MAP was higher in the octreotide group 
compared to the control group and the two groups were 
similar regarding the infusion dose of norepinephrine 
consumption. This is due to the fact that octreotide is 
not a direct vasoconstrictor. Therefore, our findings were 
similar to those obtained by Wiest R et al. indicating that 
octreotide enhanced the vasoconstrictor effect of norepi￾nephrine (22).
This study had some limitations. First, we should have 
followed renal function by other markers, such as Neu￾trophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL). Second, 
the dose of octreotide should be increased gradually for 
augmenting the systemic effect of this drug on systemic 
blood pressure.
Because anesthesiologists usually use vasopressin dur￾ing OLT operation, further studies are recommended 
to compare the effects of octreotide and vasopressin on 
hemodynamic parameters, urine output, and postopera￾tive renal function during OLT.
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical trial, seventy nine patients who had undergone 
OLT were randomly allocated into two groups. In the oc￾treotide group, the patients received octreotide infusion 
from the start of the operation. In the control group, on 
the other hand, the patients received physiologic saline 
infusion instead of octreotide. In the octreotide group, 
urine output and MAP during the three stages of OLT 
were significantly higher compared to the control group 
(P < 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was found 
between the two groups regarding baseline and postop￾erative creatinine (P > 0.05). In conclusion, octreotide 
infusion could help maintaining better renal perfusion 
and urine output during anesthesia for OLT. In addition, 
octreotide infusion could augment the vasoconstrictor 
effect of norepinephrine and improve the patients' MAP.
