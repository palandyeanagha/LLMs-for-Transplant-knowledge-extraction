Abstract
Background: TNFa levels are increased in liver cirrhosis even in the absence of infection, most likely owing to a continuous
endotoxin influx into the portal blood. Soluble TNFa receptors (sTNFR type I and II) reflect release of the short-lived TNFa,
because they are cleaved from the cells after binding of TNFa. The aims were to investigate the circulating levels of soluble
TNFR-I and -II in cirrhotic patients receiving TIPS.
Methods: Forty-nine patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension (12 viral, 37 alcoholic) received TIPS for prevention
of re-bleeding (n = 14), therapy-refractory ascites (n = 20), or both (n = 15). Portal and hepatic venous blood was drawn in
these patients during the TIPS procedure and during the control catheterization two weeks later. sTNFR-I and sTNFR-II were
measured by ELISA, correlated to clinical and biochemical characteristics.
Results: Before TIPS insertion, sTNFR-II levels were lower in portal venous blood than in the hepatic venous blood, as well as
in portal venous blood after TIPS insertion. No significant differences were measured in sTNFR-I levels. Hepatic venous levels
of sTNFR-I above 4.5 ng/mL (p = 0.036) and sTNFR-II above 7 ng/mL (p = 0.05) after TIPS insertion were associated with
decreased survival. A multivariate Cox-regression survival analysis identified the hepatic venous levels of sTNFR-I (p = 0.004)
two weeks after TIPS, and Child score (p = 0.002) as independent predictors of mortality, while MELD-score was not.
Conclusion: Hepatic venous levels of sTNFR-I after TIPS insertion may predict mortality in patients with severe portal
hypertension.

Introduction
Portal hypertension is a major cause of mortality and morbidity
in cirrhosis regardless of its aetiology [1,2]. Portal hypertension
may lead to an impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function
resulting in bacterial translocation, increased influx of endotoxin,
activation of cytokines and increased shedding of their receptors in
and outside the liver [3]. Furthermore, portal-venous shunting
may lead to a spill over of bacterial products and cytokines, e.g.
TNFa, into the systemic circulation [3,4]. TNFa increases the
intrahepatic resistance due to activation of macrophages and
hepatic stellate cells, whereas it leads to extra-hepatic vasodilation
and increased portal-venous inflow through induction of nitric
oxide. Taken together, both processes aggravate portal hyperten￾sion [5–10].
TNFa has two receptors, which upon binding of TNFa
dissociate from the membrane of the target cells. The shedded
receptors can be detected in serum as soluble TNFa receptor I
(sTNFR-I, p55, CD120A) and soluble TNFa receptor II
(sTNFR2-II, p75, CD120B), and have a longer half-life than
TNFa itself [5–8,11]. The soluble TNFa receptors have been
implicated in a variety of different liver diseases, while TNFR-I
mediates apoptosis and fibrosis, TNFR-II elicits immune-modu￾latory effects [7,12–17]. The peripheral venous levels of these
receptors reflect severity of hepatic inflammation in chronic
hepatitis C [18–23], alcoholic liver injury [24–28], and in
metabolic disorders [22,29,30]. In patients hepatic venous levels

of soluble TNFa receptors correlated with the portal endotoxin
influx [31]. Furthermore, the levels of sTNFR-II were found to be
good predictors of mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis [32].
However, the prognostic potential of sTNFRs has not yet been
studied in patients with respect to severity of portal hypertension
before and after TIPS-insertion. Complications of portal hyper￾tension, such as variceal bleeding or refractory ascites, can be
controlled by insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic porto￾systemic shunt (TIPS) [1,2,33]. This procedure allows to
simultaneously analyse blood from the portal and hepatic vein,
reflecting processes in the intestinal compartment and the liver,
respectively.
Here we investigated, whether the levels of soluble TNFRs in
patients with severe portal hypertension are changed after TIPS
insertion and whether they predict mortality in these patients.
Patients and Methods
Patients and data collection.
Forty-nine patients with liver cirrhosis and severe portal
hypertension referred for TIPS insertions were enrolled into the
study between May 1994 and March 1999. Twelve of these
patients were also included into another study, where we analyzed
the endotoxin levels [31]. General clinical characteristics are
displayed in Table 1. Inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and
80 years; confirmed liver cirrhosis; absence of infection; suitability
for TIPS placement (secondary prophylaxis for recurrent bleeding
in n = 14, therapy-refractory ascites in n = 20 and both in n = 15).
The exclusion criteria were hepatic encephalopathy greater than
grade I; bilirubin .5 mg/dL; variceal bleeding within the last
three months prior to collection of blood samples; pulmonary
arterial hypertension (.35 mmHg).
Ethics statement.
The patients signed a written inform consent for the procedures
in the study. The local ethical committee of the University of Bonn
approved the study (029/13).
Study design.
TIPS (8–10 mm Wallstent, Boston Scientific, MA, USA)
insertion was performed as previously described [34,35]. After a
mean of fourteen days, an invasive procedure was performed to
check TIPS patency and its effects on portal hemodynamics
[34,35]. This procedure was routinely used in many of our TIPS
patients to detect early dysfunction of bare metal stents, but was
widely abandoned after 2000. Portal and hepatic venous pressures
were measured invasively using a pressure transducer system
(Combitrans, Braun Melsung, Germany) and a multichannel
monitor (Sirecust, Siemens, Germany). The difference between
these pressures was defined as the portal hepatic venous pressure
gradient (PHPG). Arterial pressure and heart rate were monitored
non-invasively. Biochemical parameters, as well as portal and
systemic haemodynamics, were measured and recorded at TIPS
placement and during the TIPS check (Table 2). Biochemical
parameters were analysed using standard methods.
Measurement of soluble TNFa receptor levels.
During the TIPS procedure, blood from the portal and hepatic
veins was collected from all patients as soon as the right branch of
the portal vein was cannulated to determine levels of sTNFR-I and
II. During the invasive procedure to check TIPS patency, the
catheter was sequentially placed into the portal vein, then the
hepatic vein in order to collect blood from portal and hepatic
veins. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes
at 4uC and stored at 280uC. In the plasma samples, levels of
soluble tumor necrosis factor areceptors Type I (55 kD or
CD120a) and Type II (75 kD or CD120b) were measured by
enzyme-amplified immunoassays following the instructions of the
manufacturer (Medgenix Diagnostics, Fleurus, Belgium) [31,32].
Statistical analysis.
Data are presented as mean 6 standard deviations (SD) or
medians and ranges. The Wilcoxon test was used for comparison
of paired data and the Mann-Whitney test for unpaired
comparisons. Correlations were analysed with the Spearman
correlation coefficient. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyse
the survival rates of patients using the Log-rank test, while
transplanted patients were censored at time of transplantation.
Univariate time-to-event analysis was performed to identify
parameters which significantly predict survival. Cox-regression
analysis (forward step-wise likelihood-quotient) using the signifi￾cant predictors in the univariate analysis was performed to identify
independent predictors of survival. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
IL, USA).
Results
Clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients
The major clinical and demographic data are summarized in

The patients received TIPS due to recurrent variceal bleeding
in 14 cases, therapy of refractory ascites in 20 cases and for both
indication in 15 cases. Twenty-nine patients had episodes of
variceal bleeding prior to TIPS insertion. Oesophageal varices
were absent in only 5 patients. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) was
present in 19 patients, and 29 patients had refractory ascites
(Table 1). Of note, the patients receiving antibiotics were either
due to SBP prophylaxis or had already faded infection.
Table 2 summarises the biochemical and haemodynamic
parameters of the patients before TIPS placement and 14 days
after the placement. TIPS insertion slightly deteriorated liver
function (as assessed by bilirubin, INR and ALT) but improved
renal function in these patients (Table 2).
Patients were followed for at least 10 years. After 10 years, four
of them were still alive, 38 patients had died, 5 patients had
received a liver transplantation and 2 patients were lost from
follow-up.
Relationships between soluble TNFa receptors and portal
hepatic pressure gradients before and after TIPS insertion
Levels of soluble TNFa receptor I did not significantly differ
between the portal vein and hepatic vein, neither before TIPS nor
at the invasive check procedure 14 days after TIPS insertion
(Figure 1A, B, C). Furthermore, portal decompression by TIPS did
not induce any changes in soluble TNFR-I levels, neither in the
portal vein nor in the hepatic vein. No association with the PHPG
was observed before TIPS (data not shown). The levels of sTNFR￾I in the hepatic veins correlated inversely with the PHPG after
TIPS-placement (hepatic vein: rs= 20.505, p = 0.012).
However, levels of soluble TNFa II receptor in the hepatic vein
were significantly higher than in the portal vein (Figure 1D).
Moreover, the levels of sTNFR-II in the portal vein were higher
after TIPS insertion than before, but without any significant
difference between the portal and hepatic veins (Figure 1E). This
was accompanied by an inverse correlation of the levels of sTNFR￾Figure 2. sTNFR levels in portal and hepatic venous blood before and after TIPS in patients stratified by presence of ascites,
bleeding and indication for TIPS. Patients stratified according to their Child classes before TIPS in (A) and after TIPS in (B) showed high levels of

II in both compartments with PHPG (portal vein: rs= 20.398,
p = 0.040; hepatic vein: rs= 20.447, p = 0.019).
Correlations of soluble TNFa receptor levels with clinical
and biochemical parameters
Child score correlated with the levels of sTNFR-I in hepatic
vein before TIPS (rs= 0.364; p = 0.015) and in the portal vein after
TIPS (rs= 0.307; p = 0.036). The hepatic venous levels of sTNFR￾II increased with increasing Child-classes before TIPS and the
portal venous levels of sTNFR-I after TIPS insertion (Figure 2A,
B).
The levels of both soluble TNFa receptors were significantly
higher in patients with ascites (Figure 2C, D), and increased with
the degree of ascites, while the levels of sTNFR were lower in the
patients who received TIPS for recurrent variceal bleeding.
Soluble TNFa receptors were significantly higher in patients with
ascites than in patients receiving TIPS for recurrent variceal
bleeding alone and were highest in patients with both bleeding and
ascites (Figure 2E, F). These associations were similar before and
after TIPS placement, which again suggests a pressure-indepen￾dent relationship between sTNFR levels and complications and
degree of liver dysfunction.
The MELD score correlated significantly with the portal and
hepatic venous levels of soluble TNFa receptor I and II before and
after TIPS. This implies that levels of soluble TNFa receptors in
cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension are dependent on liver
function (Figure 3). The levels of serum creatinine were highly
correlated with portal and hepatic venous levels of soluble TNFa
receptors I and II before (sTNFR-I: portal vein: rs= 20.657,
p,0.001; hepatic vein: rs= 20.772, p,0.001; sTNFR-II: portal
vein: rs= 20.687, p,0.001; hepatic vein: rs= 20.674, p,0.001)
and after TIPS (sTNFR-I: portal vein: rs= 20.732, p,0.001;
hepatic vein: rs= 20.732, p,0.001; sTNFR-II: portal vein:
rs= 20.792, p,0.001; hepatic vein: rs= 20.636, p = 0.001).
Markers of liver synthesis capacity, e.g. choline esterase (CHE)
correlated negatively with both types of soluble TNFa receptors in
the portal and hepatic veins both before (sTNFR-I: portal vein:
rs= 20.335, p = 0.026; hepatic vein: rs= 20.582, p,0.001;
sTNFR-II: portal vein: rs= 20.427, p = 0.001; hepatic vein:
rs= 20.582, p,0.001) and after TIPS (sTNFR-I: portal vein:
rs= 20.575, p,0.001; hepatic vein: rs= 20.575, p,0.001;
sTNFR-II: portal vein: rs= 20.601, p,0.001; hepatic vein:
rs= 20.489, p = 0.001). Interestingly, the correlation between
albumin and the levels of soluble TNFR-I (portal vein:
rs= 20.473, p = 0.004; hepatic vein: rs= 20.438, p = 0.009) and
sTNFR-II (portal vein: rs= 20.398, p = 0.013; hepatic vein:
rs= 20.341, p = 0.045) after TIPS was inverse.
Patients receiving antibiotics showed significantly higher levels
of the sTNFR, while the use of beta-blocker, diuretics and
lactulose had no effect on the levels of sTNFR (data not shown).
The association of the soluble TNFa receptor levels with
survival rates in patients receiving TIPS
Survival time correlated negatively with the levels of soluble
TNFR-I in the portal vein before TIPS (rs= 20.326, p = 0.027)
and after TIPS, as well as in the hepatic vein after TIPS (portal
vein: rs= 20.329, p = 0.026; hepatic vein: rs= 20.408, p = 0.007).
The portal venous levels of soluble TNFR-II after TIPS correlated
also negatively with survival time (rs= 20.307, p = 0.036). When
stratifying patients by lower or higher levels of soluble TNFRs in
the hepatic vein (using the median to divide the groups), we
observed significantly better survival rates in patients with low
levels of the soluble TNFRs after TIPS insertion (Figure 4A, B).
In univariate analysis we analysed different parameters of
disease severity and general characteristics (Table 3). Using a Cox
regression analysis, including parameters (MELD, creatinine,
CHE, Child-score) correlating significantly with the levels of
soluble TNFRs the levels of soluble TNFR I in the hepatic vein
after TIPS, together with the Child score, were independent
predictors of survival (Table 4).
Discussion
Our study showed that TIPS does not influence the TNFa
system in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
Furthermore, the hepatic and portal venous sTNFR levels
determined before and early after TIPS placement are correlated
to other parameters reflecting hepatic dysfunction, such as Child
or MELD score. Furthermore, the levels of sTNFa receptors I in
the hepatic vein after TIPS insertion were independent predictors
of mortality.
Chronic liver disease, regardless of its aetiology, leads to
complications, such as ascites and variceal bleeding from portal
hypertension, which frequently require TIPS insertion. In these
patients the portal pressure correlates with several inflammatory
parameters indicative of an activated hepatic inflammatory status,
which may contribute to portal hypertension [5–8]. In the present
study the levels of sTNFR were higher in patients with ascites,

suggesting that these receptors might reflect bacterial translocation
and inflow of pathogen associated molecular patterns. Indeed, in
cirrhotic patients the increased endotoxin influx into the portal
vein leads to hepatic expression of soluble TNFa receptors even
without evident clinical infection [31]. Different proinflammatory
pathways (LPS/TLR/TNFa) activated by stimuli derived from the
gut appear associated with the prognosis in addition to the classical
prognostic parameters related to liver and kidney function [18–
21,23,24,26,27,36]. This can be seen in situations, where the
prognosis deteriorates despite a tremendous drop in portal
pressure by TIPS. Studies on the effects of a shunt procedure on
inflammatory stimuli would be highly relevant both form a
pathophysiological and prognostic point of view. The present
study demonstrated a sustained activation of the TNF during a
period of 14 days after TIPS placement. Obviously, TNFa￾mediated inflammation and its negative influence on prognosis
persist after TIPS.
Even though no major changes were observed in the levels of
the sTNFRs levels after TIPS, the levels of sTNFRs correlated
with parameters of liver dysfunction, confirming our previous data
[31,32]. In a previous study in patients with alcoholic liver
cirrhosis receiving TIPS levels of endotoxin in the portal vein
correlated with the levels of sTNFR in the hepatic vein, suggesting
an association between endotoxin exposure and formation of
sTNFR [31]. Interestingly, endotoxin levels in that study
correlated with portal pressure and systemic hypotension. Of
note, no correlation of sTNFR with portal pressure or portal￾hepatic pressure gradient was observed before TIPS. These data
again suggest that sTNFR levels are independent of the portal
pressure, but rather reflect other factors contributing to deterio￾ration of liver function. This assumption is supported by the fact
that the levels of sTNFR-II in the portal vein increase shortly after
TIPS insertion together with a slight increase of other markers for
deterioration of liver function such as bilirubin, ALT, c-GT and
INR.
Thus sTNFR levels in the hepatic and portal vein may predict
survival independent from portal pressure, even though difficult to
sample portal or hepatic venous blood in a daily routine. However,
sTNFRs in peripheral blood might be also suitable and their
predictive potential should be evaluated in future studies in TIPS
patients, as already shown by our group for sTNFR levels in the
peripheral blood of non-TIPS patients [32]. Interestingly, hepatic
sTNFR-I levels after TIPS are associated with long-term survival
together with Child-score (Table 4). This study emphasises that
survival of patients with severe portal hypertension is only partially
reflected by their MELD score, also after TIPS placement. The
TNFR levels add prognostic and important clinical information in
these patients. Similarly to recently published data on acute-on￾chronic liver failure, renal dysfunction and proinflammatory state
seem to predict prognosis [37]. The levels of sTNFR correlate
excellently with creatinine, and might reflect additional renal
dysfunction in these patients. This study reflects the importance of
inflammatory state in cirrhosis and indirectly it emphasizes the
role of portal hypertension in the survival of patients with liver
cirrhosis. This is supported by different studies showing an
improved survival of patients receiving TIPS for refractory ascites
[38] and as an emergency shunt for severe bleeding [39].
It is important to note that the included patients were without
overt infection [4] since it is a prerequisite for TIPS placement. As
a consequence, the levels of soluble TNFRs were much lower than
in previous studies. This suggests that the sTNFRs are also
infection-independent indicators of survival. In this situation
sTNFRs might derive from the injured liver and cells driving
hepatic inflammation and not from other foci, which might be a
confounding factor in the above-mentioned studies [14,21,32]. In
our study the levels of soluble TNFR-I showed the strongest
prediction of survival in this group of patients, despite small
number of patients.
In conclusion, the results of this study show that hepatic venous
levels of soluble TNFR-I and II early after TIPS insertion correlate
with mortality in patients with severe portal hypertension. The
findings point to the role of chronic inflammation in patients with
liver cirrhosis – independent from the degree of portal hyperten￾sion. The prognostic value of these markers may have potential in
the management of patients with severe portal hypertension
treated with TIPS. Prospective studies should further evaluate the
impact of inflammation and the potential of sTNFRs for
prognostic assessment of these patients.
