Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disease characterized by left 
ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of other etiologies. Clinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic 
to sudden cardiac death. Medical treatment is the first-line therapy for symptomatic patients. Extended left 
ventricular septal myectomy is the procedure of choice if medical treatment is unsuccessful or intolerable.
Mayo Clinic experience: More than 3,000 patients have had septal myectomy for HCM at the Mayo 
Clinic (MN, USA) from 1993 to 2016. Risk of hospital death after isolated septal myectomy for obstructive 
HCM is <1% and is similar to the risk of operation for elective mitral valve repair. Complications, such as 
complete heart block requiring permanent pacemaker, are uncommon (2%), although partial or complete 
left bundle branch block is a frequent finding on the postoperative ECG. Relief of left ventricular outflow 
tract (LVOT) obstruction with septal myectomy dramatically improves symptoms and exercise capacity 
in symptomatic patients with obstructive HCM. More than 90% of severely symptomatic patients have 
improvement by at least two functional classes, and reduction of outflow gradients by myectomy decreases 
or eliminates symptoms of dyspnea, angina and/or syncope. Basal obstruction with systolic anterior 
motion (SAM) is treated by transaortic myectomy. The transapical approach was applied in 115 patients 
with obstructive midventricular and apical variants of HCM between 1993 and 2012. All patients with 
midventricular obstruction had gradient relief and none developed an apical aneurysm or ventricular septal 
defect. Recurrent obstruction after satisfactory myectomy was rare.
Conclusions: Septal myectomy effectively and definitively relieves LVOT obstruction and cardiac 
symptoms in patients with obstructive HCM. In experienced centers, early mortality for isolated septal 
myectomy is less than 1%, and overall results are excellent and continue to improve in the current era.

Introduction
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary 
myocardial disease characterized by left ventricular 
hypertrophy in the absence of other etiologies such as 
aortic valve stenosis or systemic arterial hypertension. 
Morphology is variable, common variants being basal, 
mid-ventricular, apical, and diffuse types (Figure 1). HCM 
has different presentations, from asymptomatic to sudden 
cardiac death. The pathophysiology in obstructive HCM is 
systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the 
mitral valve, which adds to the LVOT obstruction and may 
lead to various degrees of mitral valve regurgitation, further 
exacerbating the symptomatology. Medical treatment is 
the first-line therapy for symptomatic patients with LVOT 
obstruction (1); however, extended left ventricular septal 
myectomy is the procedure of choice if medical treatment is 
unsuccessful or intolerable (2).
In this article, we will discuss the surgical management of 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at the Mayo clinic under the 
following headings:

Current indications for septal myectomy
The standard indications for septal myectomy are 
symptoms refractory to medical treatment combined with 
severe LVOT obstruction with resting gradient of more than 
30 mmHg; however, the current indications have expanded 
recently to include symptomatic patients with low resting 
outflow gradients and latent obstruction. In addition, 
our experience suggests that a subgroup of patients with 
favorable septal anatomy have particularly positive outcomes 
and might be considered for operation without a prolonged 
trial of medical treatment (3).
Adjuncts to septal myectomy
Arrhythmia surgery
Patients with HCM are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation 
(AF) secondary to long-standing elevation of the left 
ventricular end-diastolic and left atrial pressures with 
subsequent left atrial chamber enlargement. Currently,

there is little evidence to support the addition of the Cox￾maze procedure to septal myectomy; however, our current 
strategy is to perform concomitant arrhythmia surgery at 
the time of septal myectomy in the presence of AF. Early 
results have demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach 
with no mortality and a higher rate of maintenance of sinus 
rhythm (4). The type of arrhythmia (Maze) surgery that 
is best suited for patients with HCM is controversial. In 
general, we perform pulmonary vein isolation with excision 
of the left atrial appendage for those with paroxysmal AF; 
and for those with permanent/persistent AF and severely 
enlarged left atrium, we prefer bi-atrial Cox-Maze III 
procedure (cut and sew) or Cox-Maze IV.
Management of papillary muscle abnormalities
Anomalies of the mitral valve apparatus exist in some 
patients with obstructive HCM and can lead to persistent 
LVOT obstruction after septal myectomy (5,6). Anomalous 
papillary muscle insertion into the body of the anterior 
mitral leaflet (Figure 2) is a well-recognized entity and its 
diagnosis may be challenging even for the experienced 
cardiologist (7). An understanding of these mitral valve 
abnormalities with adjunctive maneuvers being applied at 
the time of extended myectomy can achieve excellent relief 
of LVOT obstruction with preservation of the native mitral 
valve function (8). This may require concomitant resection 
or mobilization of the anomalous papillary muscle(s) if 
present to ensure complete relief of the LVOT gradient.
Other anomalies of the mitral apparatus include fusion 
of the anterior papillary muscle with the ventricular septum 
or left-ventricular free wall (Figure 3), abnormal chordae 
tendineae (false chordae) that attach to the ventricular septum 
or free wall (Figure 4) and accessory papillary muscles, all of 
which may tether the mitral leaflets towards the septum (and 
outflow tract) and contribute to a persistent LVOT gradient. 
Severely hypertrophied papillary muscles or exaggerated 
anterior displacement of the anterolateral papillary muscle 
can lead to obstruction at both the outflow tract level as 
well as the midventricular level (9). The surgical principle 
of treatment is to divide attachments (fibrous or muscular) 
between the subvalvar apparatus and septum or free wall, and 
to preserve all attachments to the leading edge of the anterior 
leaflet to avoid iatrogenic mitral valve incompetence.
Management of concomitant mitral valve disease
Management of structural mitral valve disease requires 
Figure 2 Accessory papillary muscle that arises from the ventricular 
septum and is attached to the side of the anterior leaflet. This 
accessory muscle is excised in its entirety; the fibrous attachments to 
the side of the leaflet are cut and the papillary muscle is amputated 
at its base and removed (dotted line). Chordal attachments to the 
leading edge of the anterior leaflet are preserved.
Figure 3 Direct insertion of the head of the anterolateral papillary 
muscle into the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with concomitant 
fusion to the left ventricular septum and free wall. The papillary 
muscle is incised off the left ventricular septum and free wall down 
to its base (inset) in addition to performing an extended myectomy.

special attention in the setting of obstructive HCM. 
Specifically, structural abnormalities of the mitral valve 
require attention at the time of myectomy in contrast to 
SAM-mediated MR that typically resolves with extended 
myectomy alone. We perform leaflet resection for posterior 
leaflet prolapse or flail, and use artificial (GORE-TEX®) 
chordae for unsupported anterior leaflet abnormalities. The 
choice to use a flexible posterior band is individualized, and 
when a band is utilized, we slightly upsize it to minimize or 
avoid potential development of SAM postoperatively (10).
We reviewed an initial experience with 32 patients 
between 1990 and 2006 (11), who underwent combined septal 
myectomy and mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral 
valve disease. Repair techniques included leaflet resection 
in ten patients, edge-to-edge repair in six patients, leaflet 
plication in eight, and annuloplasty band/ring in 19 patients. 
There was one early death (3%) and the gradient across the 
LVOT was reduced from 63.7±37.6 mmHg preoperatively to 
10.2±19.0 mmHg at discharge. Upon discharge, mild or no 
mitral valve regurgitation was present in 21 patients, while six 
patients had mild to residual moderate mitral regurgitation. 
Alcohol septal ablation versus septal myectomy
Extended left ventricular septal myectomy is considered 
the gold standard for managing symptomatic patients 
with obstructive variants of HCM (12). Catheter-based 
alcohol septal ablation (ASA) to create a septal infarction 
has emerged as a percutaneous alternative to surgical 
septal myectomy (13,14). Both procedures can result in 
improvement of LVOT gradient, obstruction relief and 
improvement in heart failure symptoms, and importantly, 
both procedures are operator dependent. However, the 
literature tends to support better long-term symptom relief 
in those patients who undergo septal myectomy (15). It is 
important to recognize that procedural success is higher, 
and rate of complications lower, when myectomy is 
performed in experienced centers compared with alcohol 
septal ablation (13,16). 
We have previously published results of alcohol septal 
ablation in 138 patients with HCM who underwent 
such procedures between 1998 and 2006. The mortality 
and morbidity of the procedure were higher for ASA 
compared with an age- and gender-matched population 
who underwent septal myectomy at the Mayo Clinic (17). 
Septal myectomy in patients of 65 years of age or less also 
had significantly better survival and freedom from severe 
symptoms (P=0.01).
There are certain subsets of patients with HCM that are 
not candidates for alcohol septal ablation. Poor candidates 
for ASA include young patients, those with severe (diffuse) 
or relatively thin septal thickness and a very high LVOT 
gradient (13). A major advantage of septal myectomy 
over ASA is the immediate results, immediate reduction 
in LVOT gradient (18), and the lack of potential long￾term ventricular arrhythmias that are more likely with 
ASA and that may cause septal infarction. Importantly, 
septal myectomy also facilitates the correction of other 
abnormalities of the outflow tract and repair of associated 
abnormalities of the mitral valve and anomalous papillary 
muscles that can also contribute to residual dynamic outflow 
tract obstruction. These issues emphasize the importance 
of a careful preoperative echocardiogram that can identify 
abnormalities such as discrete subaortic stenosis, mitral valve 
defects (ruptured chordae), and anomalous papillary muscles 
in a patient being evaluated for presumed obstructive HCM 
and who would not respond to the ASA approach.
Septal myectomy after alcohol septal ablation
An increasing number of patients may present with 
recurrent symptoms secondary to LVOT obstruction that 
persists following ASA and requires reintervention (19).
Alcohol septal infarction frequently results in a right 
Figure 4 Fibrous attachments between the side of the anterior 
mitral leaflet and the ventricular septum or free wall. We maintain 
all attachments that come to the leading edge of the anterior mitral 
leaflet.

bundle branch block or complete heart block that requires 
permanent pacing. In addition, septal myectomy often 
results in a left bundle branch block. Subsequently, when 
myectomy follows an unsuccessful ASA, permanent 
pacing is often required postoperatively. We have 
experience with approximately 40 patients that underwent 
myectomy following ASA to date. Prior experience with 
16 patients who underwent 22 prior septal artery ablations 
between 1999 and 2006 has been reported previously. 
Results demonstrate slightly higher early mortality and 
perioperative morbidity, including higher chance of 
permanent pacemaker secondary to heart block, despite 
successful relief of the outflow tract gradient (20).
Other indications for septal myectomy
Management of apical & midventricular variants
Apical and midventricular variants of HCM are difficult 
entities to diagnose and treat medically, with the only 
alternative to myectomy being heart transplantation. There 
are two situations when the transapical approach is most 
appropriate (21). This includes midventricular obstruction 
that cannot be reached by a transaortic approach alone; this 
subgroup typically does not have SAM and the gradient is 
identified in the midventricle opposite the papillary muscles. 
Resection of midventricular obstruction is accomplished by 
an isolated transapical incision or a combined transaortic 
and transapical approach. The second subgroup is the non￾obstructive apical morphology that results in a small left 
ventricular cavity, diastolic dysfunction and “below normal” 
stroke volume. This physiology also results in refractory 
heart failure symptoms similar to the obstructive variants. 
The purpose of apical myectomy in this group is to increase 
the left ventricular end diastolic and systolic dimensions, 
which will result in an increase in stroke volume into 
the normal range. Heart failure symptoms in the non￾obstructive category are also abolished with this approach. 
Management of pediatric HCM
Pediatric HCM can cause significant outflow tract 
obstruction and symptoms of heart failure. It is one of the 
most common causes of sudden death in young people (13). 
Medical treatment and indications for surgery are generally 
the same as the adult population; however, symptoms are 
more commonly absent in the child, which makes the 
timing of myectomy more difficult. In addition, myectomy 
is more challenging in children because of smaller structures 
(aortic root) and, consequently, incomplete myectomy or 
aortic or mitral valve injury is more likely than in the adult 
population. The overall prognosis of HCM in the pediatric 
population has been shown to be less favorable than for 
adults (22,23). However, in our experience, septal myectomy 
remains safe and effective in symptomatic children and late 
survival is better than in the previously published untreated 
natural history of HCM in children (24).
Our experience with myectomy in children approaches 
200 consecutive patients. We previously published our 
experience (24) with 127 consecutive children and young 
adults (<21 years of age; 62% male) who underwent 
transaortic septal myectomy for obstructive HCM 
from January 1975 to December 2010. The mean age 
at operation was 12.9±5.5 years. Preoperatively, mean 
maximum instantaneous gradient was 89 mmHg and 
95% had significant SAM with mitral regurgitation. An 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and permanent 
pacemaker prior to surgery was present in 21 (17%) and 15 
(11.7%) patients, respectively.
Transaortic extended left ventricular septal myectomy 
was performed in all patients with no early deaths. 
Iatrogenic morbidity included new aortic valve regurgitation 
requiring repair in seven patients (5.5%), mitral 
regurgitation (MR) needing repair in two patients (1.5%), 
ventricular septal defect in one patient (1%) and heart block 
requiring permanent pacemaker in one patient (1%). An 
ICD was inserted postoperatively in eight patients during 
the same hospital admission. Mean maximum gradient 
decreased from 89 to 6 mmHg (P<0.0001). Postoperatively, 
residual chordal SAM was present in 23% with mild or no 
MR; moderate MR was detected in only one patient. Four 
patients (3%) died late during the mean follow-up period 
of 8.3 years (max: 37 years); one death was sudden. Overall 
survival was 98.6%, 94.9%, 92.4% and 92.4% at 5, 10, 
15 and 20 years, respectively. Freedom from any cardiac 
reoperation was 91.2%, 87.8%, 78.7% and 72.7% at 5, 10, 
15 and 20 years, respectively. Repeat septal myectomy was 
performed in six patients (5%). At late follow-up, 95% were 
in NYHA functional class I or II, and 25 patients underwent 
late ICD placement. Patient selection and surgical expertise 
remain critical components for the success of septal 
myectomy in the pediatric population.
The phenomenon of latent obstruction
There is a group of patients with HCM that are

symptomatic despite a low resting LVOT gradient and it 
can be unclear whether their symptoms are due to diastolic 
dysfunction or a labile outflow tract gradient (25). We 
reviewed our experience with 249 patients with latent 
obstruction (0–30 mmHg resting gradient) but with 
evidence of severe LVOTO when provoked by Valsalva 
maneuver or amyl nitrite inhalation during Doppler 
echocardiography. This group was compared with 
those who had severe resting gradient (>30 mmHg) and 
underwent myectomy during the same time period. Early 
mortality was similarly low (1%) and long-term survival 
was comparable with an age-matched population. We 
concluded that these patients should be offered surgical 
septal myectomy despite their low resting gradient, since it 
appears that their symptoms are more related to their latent 
form of obstruction rather than diastolic dysfunction, and 
early and late results are favorable. 
Recurrent outflow tract obstruction after prior septal 
myectomy
Despite the excellent results of septal myectomy in 
relieving the LVOT gradient, there is a small group 
of patients who undergo septal myectomy and present 
with recurrent symptoms of outflow tract obstruction. 
In general, this is more often related to inadequate relief 
of obstruction (i.e., incomplete myectomy) at the initial 
operation as opposed to recurrent growth of muscle 
during the follow-up period. This is particularly noted 
in children who appear to be at higher risk of having 
such recurrence (26). The small nature of the aortic root 
can predispose to inadequate myectomy; the cause of 
incomplete myectomy is most often due to inadequate 
muscle resection at the midventricular level (i.e., the apical 
extent of resection) and is frequently related to surgeon 
inexperience. This is also often the case in the adult 
population. Our current experience with redo myectomy 
now includes approximately 50 patients. We reported our 
initial experience of 13 patients between 1975 and 2003 
who underwent repeat septal myectomy (27). Age ranged 
from 4 to 70 years and the interval between the initial 
and repeat myectomy ranged from 13 months to 11 years. 
We identified the following mechanisms of recurrent 
LVOTO: limited initial myectomy in 11 patients, septal 
hypertrophy at the midventricular level in eight and 
anomalous papillary muscle in three patients. There was 
only one death during late follow-up and all patients 
had excellent symptom relief. Repeat septal myectomy is 
feasible and should be offered to symptomatic patients 
with dynamic outflow tract obstruction. 
Outcomes of septal myectomy at the Mayo 
clinic
More than 3,000 patients have had septal myectomy for 
HCM at the Mayo Clinic (MN, USA) from 1993 to 2016. 
Risk of hospital death after isolated septal myectomy for 
obstructive HCM was <1% and is similar to the risk of 
operation for elective mitral valve repair. Complications 
such as iatrogenic ventricular septal defect was rare (<0.3%). 
Complete heart block requiring permanent pacemaker was 
uncommon (2%), although partial or complete left bundle 
branch block was a frequent finding on the postoperative 
ECG. Usually, this is not associated with adverse sequelae, 
but if the patient has complete right bundle branch block 
preoperatively, the left bundle branch block after myectomy 
increases the risk of complete heart block and the need for 
permanent pacing. This is particularly important in patients 
who have had alcohol septal ablation preoperatively, 
which leads to right bundle branch block in up to 60% 
of patients (28). Relief of LVOT obstruction with septal 
myectomy dramatically improves symptoms and exercise 
capacity in symptomatic patients with obstructive HCM. 
Approximately 90% of severely symptomatic patients have 
improvement of at least two functional classes and relief 
of outflow gradients by myectomy is equally effective 
in improving limitations caused by dyspnea, angina 
or syncope (29). Importantly, symptomatic benefit of 
myectomy is related directly to reducing the basal outflow 
obstruction, MR and improving left ventricular systolic 
and end-diastolic pressures (in more than 90% of patients), 
which in turn may also favorably influence myocardial 
ischemia.
Relief of the gradient may decrease left atrial size and 
the subsequent risk of developing AF. Importantly, the late 
survival is equivalent to an age-matched population and the 
risk of appropriate ICD discharges decreases significantly 
after abolishment of the gradient.
We have used the transapical approach in a total of 115 
patients with midventricular and apical variants of HCM 
between 1993 and 2012. All patients with midventricular 
obstruction (n=55) had gradient relief and none developed a 
ventricular septal defect. In addition, we have not observed 
complications from the left ventriculotomy such as left 
ventricular apical aneurysm or ventricular arrhythmias. The 
apical incision and its closure produce an area of akinesis,

but this is relatively small and does not lead to significant 
systolic dysfunction. Indeed, in patients with apical HCM, 
the apex is obliterated with muscle and does not contribute 
to LV stroke volume (30).
Summary
Septal myectomy is the most effective treatment of LVOT 
obstruction and cardiac symptoms in adults and children 
with obstructive HCM. In experienced centers, early 
mortality for isolated septal myectomy is less than 1% 
and overall results are excellent and continue to improve 
in the current era. Late recurrence of significant resting 
left ventricular outflow gradients is very uncommon 
after successful myectomy and complete elimination of 
the gradient in both adults and children with obstructive 
HCM. Recurrent LVOT obstruction and symptoms may 
occur due to inadequate myectomy at the first operation, 
midventricular obstruction or anomalies of mitral valve 
and papillary muscles. Lifelong medical surveillance is 
important in all patients despite good surgical results.
