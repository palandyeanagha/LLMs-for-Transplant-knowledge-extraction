Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a
major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. The pathogenesis of HCC
in HCV infection has extensively been analysed. Hepatitis
C virus-induced chronic inflammation and the effects of
cytokines in the development of fibrosis and liver cell
proliferation are considered as one of the major patho￾genic mechanisms. Increasing experimental evidence
suggests that HCV contributes to HCC by directly
modulating pathways that promote the malignant trans￾formation of hepatocytes. Hepatitis C virus is an RNA
virus that does not integrate into the host genome but
HCV proteins interact with many host-cell factors well
beyond their roles in the viral life cycle and are involved in
a wide range of activities, including cell signaling,
transcription, cell proliferation, apoptosis, membrane
rearrangements, vesicular trafficking and translational
regulation. At least four of the HCV gene products,
namely HCV core, NS3, NS4B and NS5A, have been
shown to exhibit transformation potential in tissue culture
and several potentially oncogenic pathways have been
shown to be altered by the expression of HCV proteins.
Both HCV core and NS5A induce the accumulation of
wild-type b-catenin and the Wnt–b-catenin pathway
emerges as a common target for HCV (and HBV) in
human HCCs, also independently from axin/b-catenin
gene mutations. Induction of both endoplasmic reticulum
stress and oxidative stress by HCV proteins might also
contribute to HCV transformation. Most of the putative
transforming functions of the HCV proteins have been
defined in artificial cellular systems, which may not be
applicable to HCV infection in vivo, and still need to be
established in relevant infection and disease models.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the most
common cancers in many countries (Bosch et al., 1999).
A recent estimate indicates that HCC represents the fifth
most common cancer of males, and the eighth most
common cancer in female candidates, with a total of
560 000 new cases each year, 83% of which occurring in
developing countries, and more than one-half in China
alone. Moreover, because of its very poor prognosis,
HCC represents the third leading cause of cancer death
worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B and C and associated
liver cirrhosis represent major risk factors for HCC
development, being implicated in more than 70% of
HCC cases worldwide. The rise in the incidence of and
mortality from HCC recently observed in most indus￾trialized countries likely reflects the increased prevalence
of HCV infection (Taylor-Robinson et al., 1997; Deuffic
et al., 1998; El-Serag and Mason, 1999; El-Serag et al.,
2003). A large analysis of HCC in Europe, based on
both serology and molecular tests, has demonstrated the
major impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C
virus (HCV). Only 29% of HCC cases were found
negative for these viruses. The hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV antibodies were de￾tected in 19 and 40.1% of the patients, respectively, with
HCV 1b being the most prevalent genotype (Brechot
et al., 1998) Additional etiological factors that often
represent co-factors of an underlying HBV- or HCV￾related chronic liver disease include toxins and drugs
(e.g., alcohol, aflatoxins, microcystin, anabolic steroids),
metabolic liver diseases (e.g., hereditary haemochroma￾tosis, a1-antitrypsin deficiency), steatosis (Ohata et al.,
2003) and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (Brunt et al.,
2004), diabetes (Davila et al., 2005). In general, HCCs
are more frequent in men than in women and the
incidence increases with age.
As for most types of cancer, hepatocarcinogenesis is a
multistep process involving different genetic alterations
that ultimately lead to malignant transformation of the
hepatocyte. The detailed analysis of HCC development
in experimental animals and the comparison of the
results with HCC in humans has identified a variety of
genomic and molecular alterations in fully developed
HCC (Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002) and to a
lesser extent in morphologically defined pre-neoplastic
precursor lesions (Llovet et al., 2003; Kojiro, 2005).

However, in most studies, single chromosome loci,
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes have been
analysed in relatively small series of human HCCs and
lesions from experimental animals. Indeed, although
significant progress has been achieved in recognizing the
sequence of events involved in other forms of cancer,
notably colorectal cancer and certain hematopoietic
malignancies, we still lack a coherent understanding of
the mechanisms of HCC development. In particular, the
contribution of the different etiological factors and their
interactions in hepatocarcinogenesis are still poorly
understood and we have not yet identified critical
genomic and/or molecular aberrations that might
improve diagnosis or be targeted for therapeutic
interventions.
Malignant transformation of hepatocytes is believed
to occur, regardless of the etiological agent, through a
pathway of increased liver cell turnover, induced by
chronic liver injury and regeneration, in a context of
inflammation and oxidative DNA damage (Figure 1).
This microenvironment facilitates the occurrence of
genetic and epigenetic alterations. Chronic viral hepa￾titis, alcohol, metabolic liver diseases such as hemo￾chromatosis and a1-antitrypsin deficiency, as well as
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may act predominantly
through this pathway of chronic liver injury, regenera￾tion and cirrhosis. Accordingly, the major clinical risk
factor for HCC development is liver cirrhosis and 70–90%
of all HCCs develop in a cirrhotic liver. The risk of HCC
in patients with liver cirrhosis depends on the activity,
duration and the etiology of the underlying liver disease.
The co-existence of multiple etiologies, for example,
HCV infection with overt or occult HBV, aflatoxin B1
(AFB1) and HBV infection, HCV infection and alcohol
or HCV infection and liver steatosis, increases the
relative risk of HCC development. Dysplastic nodules
and macroregenerative nodules are considered pre￾neoplastic lesions (Furuya et al., 1988; Terada et al.,
1993). Several observations support this hypothesis.
Firstly, direct outgrowth of HCC from cirrhotic nodules
has been described as the nodule-in-nodule appearance.
Secondly, 50–60% of the cirrhotic macronodules have a
monoclonal origin when examined for the X-chromo￾some methylation pattern. Thirdly, chromosome aber￾rations and allelic losses are found in half of cirrhotic
nodules and in small cell dysplasia, thus indicating that
they represent true pre-malignant lesions of HCC. Only
in less than 10% of the cases, HCCs, are observed in
non-cirrhotic livers and even without inflammatory
lesions. These HCCs developing in an otherwise normal
livers are usually found in patients without well￾established risk factors and some of these cases may
correspond to the malignant transformation of liver
adenoma rare benign hepatocellular tumors sometimes
found in young women taking oral contraceptives
(Bluteau et al., 2002).

which often represent co-factors of an underlying HBV- or HCV-related chronic liver disease, include toxins and drugs (e.g., alcohol,

steatosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and diabetes. Hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process that may last for decades and
involves the progressive accumulation of different genetic alterations ultimately leading to malignant transformation. Regardless of the
etiological agent, malignant transformation of hepatocytes is believed to occur through a pathway of increased liver cell turnover,
induced by chronic liver injury and regeneration, in a context of inflammation and oxidative DNA damage. Dysplastic nodules and
macroregenerative nodules are considered as pre-neoplastic lesions. The detailed analysis of HCC development in experimental
animals and the comparison of the results with HCC in humans has identified a variety of genomic and molecular alterations in fully
developed HCC and to a lesser extent in morphologically defined pre-neoplastic precursor lesions. At least four pathways that regulate
either cell proliferation or cell death (i.e., the phospho-retinoblastoma (pRb), p53, transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) a nd
b-catenin pathways) are affected in HCCs.

Molecular pathways in human hepatocarcinogenesis
At least four pathways that regulate either cell
proliferation or cell death (i.e., the phospho-retinoblas￾toma (pRb), p53, transforming growth factor-b (TGF￾b) a nd b-catenin pathways) are affected in HCCs
(Ozturk, 1999; Moradpour and Wands, 2002; Morad￾pour and Blum, 2005). Although activated ras family
oncogenes have been found in spontaneous and
chemically induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis models
and the cyclin D has been found to be amplified in 10–20%
of human cases (Nishida et al., 1994), no consistent
pattern of proto-oncogene activation has emerged so far
in human HCCs. Deregulated expression of b-catenin,
resulting from Adenomatous Polyposis of the Colon
(APC) defects, b-catenin gene mutations and/or Wnt
signaling pathway alterations, appears to play a role in
more than 50% of HCCs (Ozturk, 1999). The Wnt/
Frizzled/b-catenin signaling is mediated by a complex
interaction between a Wnt ligand (Wnt) and a Frizzled
receptor (Fzd), mostly in cooperation with the low￾density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein
(LRP-5 or -6) co-receptors. The Wnt/b-catenin pathway
is involved in developmental control, cell adhesion and
cell proliferation. Cellular levels of b-catenin are tightly
regulated by proteasome-dependent degradation, which
is in turn controlled by the activity of the APC and
Axin1 proteins, and the glycogen synthase kinase-3b
(GSK-3b). Accumulation of nuclear b-catenin-contain￾ing complexes leads to the unrestricted transcription of
several cell-cycle control genes. Differently from colon
carcinoma, somatic APC gene mutations appear to be
rare in HCC, whereas activating mutations of b-catenin
were reported in 18–41% of HCCs (De LaCoste et al.,
1998; Miyoshi et al., 1998) and Axin1 gene mutations
have been found in a substantial proportion of HCCs
with b-catenin accumulation in the absence of mutation
of the b-catenin gene (Satoh et al., 2000a). A recent
report indicates that the Frizzled type 7 receptor (Fzd-7)
is overexpressed in above 90% of HCCs and in around
75% of the corresponding peritumorous/precancerous
liver parenchyma as compared to normal livers and that
Fzd-7 is also involved in wild-type b-catenin stabiliza￾tion/activation (Merle et al., 2004). Interestingly,
b-catenin mutations and/or deregulation in HCC
correlate(s) with a low rate of loss of heterozygosity
(LOH), suggesting that b-catenin pathway activation
over-rides the need for multiple genetic/epigenetic events
and loss of tumor suppressor genes in the multistep
process of hepatocarcinogenesis and may lead more
directly to the liver malignant phenotype (Legoix et al.,
1999).
The upregulation of growth factors expression and
the activation of components of their signaling path￾ways also play an important role in hepatocarcinogen￾esis. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II, insulin receptor
substrate 1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and TGF-a
and b have been involved in the development of HCC
(Moradpour and Wands, 2002). Unexpectedly, HGF, a
mitogen for normal hepatocytes, inhibits the growth of
hepatoma cell lines in vitro and the development of HCC
in transgenic mouse models of hepatocarcinogenesis
(Santoni-Rugiu et al., 1996). Overexpression of the
angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor
(Mise et al., 1996; Yamaguchi et al., 1998) and
angiopoietin-2 (Tanaka et al., 1999; Mitsuhashi et al.,
2003) has been documented in HCC. These findings are
particularly relevant as the evolution from pre-neoplatic
to HCC nodules is accompanied by neovascolarization
and HCC is often a highly vascular tumor.
Several studies of paired HCC and non-tumorous
liver samples have revealed relatively frequent allelic
losses (LOH) on chromosomes 1, 2q, 4, 5q, 6q, 8, 9, 10q,
11p, 13q, 14q, 16, 17 and 22q (Ozturk, 1999; Moradpour
and Wands, 2002; Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002),
suggesting that these sites may harbor tumor suppressor
genes relevant for HCC pathogenesis. Recent large
genomewide scans using microsatellite markers and
comparative genomic hybridization studies have con￾firmed and extended these observations (Boige et al.,
1997; Marchio et al., 1997; Nagai et al., 1997). However,
only few tumor suppressor genes located in these deleted
regions have been clearly involved in a significant subset
of HCCs and the search for a liver-specific tumor
suppressor has essentially failed. On the other hand, the
pRb tumor suppressor pathway is altered in more than
50% of human HCCs owing to genetic and epigenetic
changes (Ozturk, 1999). The Rb protein and its
regulators p16INK4A and cyclin D are involved in the
G1/S progression of the cell cycle. Loss of heterozygos￾ity at the RB1 locus is quite frequent and RB1 gene
mutations are found in about 15% of human HCCs.
Both mutations of the p16INK4A gene and its
inactivation by methylation have been described (Liew
et al., 1999). Recently, overexpression of gankyrin, a six
ankyrin repeat protein, that mediates pRb degradation
by the 26S proteasome, has also been described
(Higashitsuji et al., 2000), thus providing an additional,
liver-specific mechanism of pRb inactivation.
A G-to-T mutation at the third base position of codon
249 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is found in up to
50–70% of HCCs in patients from southern Africa and
the Qidong area in China (Bressac et al., 1991; Hsu
et al., 1991). This ‘hot-spot’ mutation, leading to an
arginine to serine substitution (R249S) and the expres￾sion of aDNA-binding defective p53 mutant protein, is
associated with high food contamination with the AFB1
mycotoxin (Aguilar et al., 1993). In other regions where
aflatoxin levels in food are low or undetectable low p53
mutation rates are observed (o4% of HCCs) and no
specific gene mutation pattern can been detected
(Ozturk, 1999). Importantly, dietary AFB1 exposure
and co-existing HBV infection appear to act synergis￾tically and are associated with even higher rates of HCC
development (Henry et al., 1999; Sun et al., 1999; Ming
et al., 2002). Polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the
biotransformation of environmental toxins such as
AFB1, benz[a]pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons may contribute a genetic susceptibility to
the development of HCC (Chen and Chen, 2002). The
p53-related tumor suppressor p73 is also deregulated in
HCC. Mutations in the p73 gene have not been

described (Levrero et al., 2000), but the amino-terminal￾deleted isoform DNp73, which acts as a dominant trans￾repressor of both p53 and proapoptotic TAp73 proteins
(Vossio et al., 2002), accumulates progressively in
chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC, and confers to
HCC cells achemoresistant phenotype (Muller et al.,
2005; Palescandolo et al., 2006). DNp73 is expressed
from an alternative P2p73 promoter, which is controlled
in hepatocytes by NF-kB a nd b-catenin (Palescandolo
et al., 2006). This latter observation links b-catenin
activation with p53 and TAp73 functional inactivation
that is mediated by DNp73 overexpression and does not
require the selection of p53 gene-inactivating mutations.
Additional, transactivation-deficient NH-terminally
truncated DTA-p73 oncogenic proteins are overex￾pressed from the P1p73 promoter in asubset of HCCs
(Putzer et al., 2003).
Loss of pRb and p53 pathways leads to genomic
instability, which plays an important permissive role in
malignant transformation. Defective DNA mismatch
repair and microsatellite instability occur in a subset of
HCCs (MacDonald et al., 1998), although the frequency
of such defects is debated (Piao et al., 2000). Moreover,
recent evidence suggests that telomere dysfunction,
leading to telomere-based chromosomal instability,
occurs during the early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis,
whereas activation of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein
enzyme that prevents the shortening of telomeres and
extends cell life span, occurs later during HCC progres￾sion (Farazi et al., 2003).
The overall emerging picture is that of HCCs as
genetically very heterogeneous tumors. This is not
completely unexpected, given the heterogeneity of
etiological factors implicated in the development of
HCC, the complexity of hepatocyte functions and the
late stage at which HCCs are usually detected and
analysed. Genomewide analysis of genetic alterations in
HCC showed that genetic alterations are not randomly
distributed in tumors but are closely associated in
clusters, and has enabled the definition of two main
mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis. In the first, genetic
alterations are accumulated through chromosome in￾stability, and in the second, activation of the Wnt
pathway by b-catenin mutation is predominant (Laurent￾Puig et al., 2001). Associations between etiological
factors of HCC and genetic alterations in tumors have
been found, and globally, chromosome instability
together with p53 and Axin1 mutations was closely
related to HBV infection. In contrast, the second
hepatocarcinogenesis pathway, defined by b-catenin
mutation associated with chromosome 8p deletion in a
context of chromosome stability, is significantly asso￾ciated with the absence of HBV infection.
Hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma
The notion of HCV, a completely cytoplasmic-replicat￾ing virus, that induces oncogenic transformation has
challenged the current conventional biological models
for viral oncogenesis. As HCC associated with HCV
infection evolves after many years of chronic infection
and is generally preceded by the development of
cirrhosis (NIH Conference, 2002), the role of chronic
liver injury followed by regeneration, cirrhosis and the
development of HCC has been the leading hypothesis.
Increasing experimental evidence, however, raises the
possibility that HCV might also contribute through
more direct pathways in promoting malignant transfor￾mation of hepatocytes. Different viral proteins, notably
core (Moriya et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2002), NS3
(Sakamuro et al., 1995) and NS5A (Gale et al., 1999),
have been implicated in transformation and HCC
development.
The hepatitis C virus
Hepatitis C virus is a member of the Flaviviridae family
of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses and is the
only member of the genus Hepacivirus (Tellinghuisen
and Rice, 2002). The HCV genome consists of an RNA
molecule, of approximately 9.6 kb, that contains a large
open-reading frame flanked by structured 50 and 30 non￾translated regions (NTRs). Viral proteins are translated
as a polyprotein precursor from an internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) located in the 50 NTR (Figure 2). The
polyprotein undergoes acomplex series of co- and post￾translational cleavage events catalysed by both host and
viral proteinases to yield the individual HCV proteins
(Figure 3). The structural proteins include the core
protein and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. The
non-structural proteins include the P7 polypeptide, the
NS2-3 autoprotease and the NS3 serine protease, an
RNA helicase located in the C-terminal region of NS3,
the NS4A polypeptide, the NS4B and NS5A proteins,
and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Tell￾inghuisen and Rice, 2002). An additional HCV protein,
F (for frameshift protein) or ARFP (for alternate
reading frame protein), generated by an overlapping
reading frame in the core (C) protein coding sequence,
has been proposed (Waleswski et al., 2001; Xu et al.,
2001; Varaklioti et al., 2002)
The study of HCV life cycle and replication has been
limited by the lack of efficient cell culture systems that
support high-level HCV replication and HCV molecular
biology has mainly been addressed by expressing
individual viral proteins. The development of efficient
cell culture HCV RNA replication systems based on the
replicon technology (Lohmann et al., 1999, 2001; Blight
et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2001) has allowed to perform
molecular genetic studies to determine the function of
individual HCV proteins during replication. Replicons
are self-replicating HCV genomic RNA molecules. The
prototype replicon usually consists of a self-replicating
RNA that contains the 50 and 30 ends of the HCV
genome (50 NTR, 30 NTR), a selectable marker gene
(e.g., neo), and the non-structural genes of HCV that
encode the viral replicase (NS3-5b). Translation of the
neo marker gene is mediated by the natural HCV IRES,
whereas translation initiation of HCV NS2-5b is
mediated by an encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV)

Figure 3 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins. Genetic organization and polyprotein processing of HCV. The 9.6 kb positive-strand
RNA genome is composed of a50 non-coding region (NCR), a long open-reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor of about
3000 amino acids and a 30 NCR. The polyprotein precursor is processed into structural and non-structural proteins by cellular and
viral proteases. Solid rods denote cleavage sites of the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase. The open rod indicates the additional C￾terminal processing of the core protein by signal peptide peptidase. Arrow heads indicate cleavages by HCV NS2-3 and NS3 proteases.
Besides their roles in the viral life cycle, HCV proteins interact with many host-cell factors and impact on a wide range of cellular
activities, including cell signaling, transcriptional modulation, transformation, apoptosis, membrane rearrangements, vesicular
trafficking and translational regulation.

IRES. More recently, systems have also been developed
for the expression of the full-length HCV polyprotein in
the context of a replicating viral RNA (Ikeda et al.,
2002; Pietschmann et al., 2002). Although these
constructs may provide a system to evaluate some of
the early aspects of assembly, they replicate with lower
efficiency and do not assemble into infectious virions.
Replicons have been instrumental in defining the
cellular localization and topology of the HCV non￾structural proteins. The structural proteins, namely C,
E1 and E2, are cleaved from the polyprotein by the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptidases and, after
maturation in the ER, are assembled into the progeny
virions in internal membrane compartments. E2 is also
responsible for binding the putative host-cell receptor(s),
including the CD81 tetraspannin. The function of the
small hydrophobic p7 protein, located in the polyprotein
at the junction of the structural and non-structural
proteins, is unknown. The non-structural proteins form
the viral replicase complex. The NS2 protein, together
with the amino-terminal region of the NS3 protein,
constitutes the NS2–NS3 proteinase, which catalyses a
single autocatalytic cleavage between NS2 and NS3.
Once released from NS2, the amino-terminal domains of
the NS3 proteins serve as serine proteinases for the
release of the remaining non-structural proteins from
the polyprotein. The carboxy-terminal region of the NS3
protein has RNA helicase activity. The NS4A protein
acts as a co-factor/enhancer for the activities of NS3.
The function of the hydrophobic integral membrane
protein NS4B is unknown, but it interacts with the viral
replicase. NS5A is a hydrophilic membrane-associated
protein and exists in multiple phosphorylation states.
The NS5B protein is the RNA-dependent RNA poly￾merase. Viral RNA replication is thought to occur in the
perinuclear membrane. The replication complex con￾tains the viral polymerase, helicase as well as a number
of host-cell factors.
Hepatitis C virus proteins and host-cell factors
The proteins and RNA of HCV also interact with many
host-cell factors besides their roles in the viral life -cycle.
Interactions of HCV proteins with the translation
machinery and post-translational modification systems
have been described. In addition, HCV proteins have
been proposed to be involved in awide range of
activities, including cell signaling, transcriptional
modulation, transformation, apoptosis, membrane
rearrangements, vesicular trafficking and translational
regulation (Figure 3). Indeed, at least four of the HCV
gene products (core, NS3, NS4B and NS5A) have been
shown to exhibit transformation potential in tissue
culture (Sakamuro et al., 1995; Ray et al., 1996; Gale
et al., 1999; Park et al., 2000). Owing to the enormous
amount of information that has been generated
regarding the properties of HCV structural and non￾structural proteins and their interactions with cellular
proteins and functions, only the findings that are
potentially relevant for malignant transformation are
summarized below.
Hepatitis C virus core
Hepatitis C virus core is involved in binding viral RNA,
regulating HCV RNA translation, making homotypic
interactions for particle assembly and interacting with
the glycoproteins to generate a complete virion. In
addition to these more predictable functions, the core
gene product has been proposed to be also involved in
cell signaling, transcriptional activation, apoptosis, lipid
metabolism and transformation. An extensive list of
cellular proteins has been shown to interact with HCV
core, but, in most cases, it is still unclear whether these
interactions occur in the course of a normal infection or
reflect protein overexpression.
Hepatitis C virus core binds to the p53 (Ray et al.,
1997; Lu et al., 1999), p73 (Alisi et al., 2003) and pRb
(Cho et al., 2001) tumor suppressor proteins, but the
functional consequences of these interactions have not
fully been elucidated. p73/core interaction results in the
nuclear translocation of HCV core protein in the
presence of the either p73a or p73b tumour suppressor
proteins. The interaction with HCV core protein
prevents p73a-, but not p73b-dependent cell growth
arrest in a p53-dependent manner (Alisi et al., 2003).
Hepatitis C virus core protein also modulates the
expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
inhibitor p21/Waf (Wang et al., 2000). p21/Waf is a
transcriptional target of p53 and regulates the activities
of cyclin/CDK complexes involved in cell-cycle control
and tumor formation. Downregulation of p21WAF1
expression is due to adecrease in the p21WAF1 gene
transcription and of the p21WAF1 protein half-life.
Hepatitis C virus core protein is produced as an innate
form (amino acids 1–191) that is then processed to
produce a mature form (amino acids 1–173). The innate
core protein in the cytoplasm increases the amount of
p21WAF1 by activating p53, and the mature core protein
in the nucleus decreases the amount of p21WAF1 by
a p53-independent pathway (Varaklioti et al., 2002;
Yamanaka et al., 2002).
Additional proteins that interact with C include the
LZIP protein (Jin et al., 2000), the hnRNP K (Hsieh
et al., 1998), the RNA helicase DEAD box DDX3
protein (Mamiya and Worman, 1999; Owsianka and
Patel, 1999; You et al., 1999) and the 14-3-3 protein
(Aoki et al., 2000). The tumor necrosis factor receptor
(Zhu et al., 1998) and the lymphotoxin b receptor
(Matsumoto et al., 1997) have been shown to interact
with C and a role in inhibiting apoptosis has been
proposed for HCV core through these interactions
(Ruggieri et al., 1997; Balachandran et al., 1998; Ray
et al., 1998; Zhu et al., 1998, 2001; Marusawa et al.,
1999; Machida et al., 2001). Hepatitis C virus core also
has been proposed to have immunosuppressive activities
through its interaction with the complement receptor
C1qR on T cells, thus contributing to chronic infection
(Kittlesen et al., 2000).
The mechanism by which HCV core regulates
transcription has been proposed to be indirect, with
the core protein interacting with cytoplasmic signal￾transduction molecules and leading to modulation of
transcription for genes dependent on these cascades. The

Raf1/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) path￾way has consistently been reported to be activated by
HCV core (Aoki et al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 2000;
Tsuchihara et al., 2000; Fukuda et al., 2001; Giambar￾tolomei et al., 2001; Erhardt et al., 2002), resulting in
relieve from serum starvation growth arrest and cell
proliferation. Conflicting reports have shown both
activation (Tai et al., 2000a, b; Ray et al., 2002, Soo
et al., 2002) and repression (Joo et al., 2005) of the NF￾kB pathways by HCV core. Although full-length HCV
core protein does not translocate to the nucleus (Chang
et al., 1994; Ravaggi et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 1995), a
number of reports suggest amore direct, nuclear role of
HCV core on transcriptional elements. Recent reports
have also implicated HCV core in the activation of the
Wnt/b-catenin pathway. Indeed, expression of HCV
core protein has been shown to induce cell proliferation
DNA synthesis, and cell-cycle progression either alone
or in the context of HCV replication, which is mediated
by transcriptional upregulation of growth-related genes,
in particular wnt-1 and its downstream target gene wisp￾2 (Fukutomi et al., 2005). Abrogation of wnt-1
expression by specific small interfering RNA blunts
core-mediated cell growth and, consistent with secretion
of the wnt-1 protein, conditioned medium from wnt-1-
transfected cells accelerated cell growth. Microarray
analysis revealed significant transcriptional changes in
372 of 12 500 human genes in core protein-expressing
cells, with upregulation, besides wnt-1 and wisp-2 of
many genes involved in cell growth, oncogenic signaling
and cell lipid metabolism and downregulation of genes
associated with immunity, cellular defense systems and
inflammatory responses (Fukutomi et al., 2005).
Hepatitis C virus core variants isolated from liver
tumor but not from adjacent non-tumor tissue interact
with Smad3 and inhibit the TGF-b pathway (Pavio
et al., 2005), suggesting that during chronic infection,
viral variants that promote cell transformation by
providing clonally expanding cells with resistance to
TGF-b antiproliferative effects are actively selected.
Indeed, HCV exists as quasi-species in patient sera or
tissues and the switch from acute to chronic infection
has been associated with a wider variety of viral quasi￾species (Thimme et al., 2002). Hepatitis C virus genetic
variability is well characterized for the hypervariable
region 1 of E2 and NS5A (Polyak et al., 1998), and it has
been involved in viral escape from the immune system
and resistance to interferon therapy. Hepatitis C virus
quasi-species seem to be compartmentalized into differ￾ent cell types such as the liver or peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (Lerat et al., 1998), and, in the liver,
different viral variants have been isolated in tumor (T)
and non-tumor (NT) regions, suggesting that these may
contribute to HCV-induced carcinogenesis (Ruster
et al., 2001; Alam et al., 2002). TGF-b signaling not
only controls cell proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis but also plays an important role in liver
repair processes and fibrogenesis through its action on
the extracellular matrix. Hepatitis C virus-infected
patients have high levels of TGF-b, which correlate
with the degree of fibrosis (Nelson et al., 1997; Marcellin
et al., 2002; Neuman et al., 2002). On the other hand,
wild-type core has been shown to upregulate TGF-b
expression at the transcriptional level (Taniguchi et al.,
2004) and to induce TGF-b synthesis in hepatic stellate
cells, thus promoting fibrogenesis (Bataller et al., 2004).
Induction of TGF-b would at the same time favor viral
persistence by limiting the antiviral immune response.
To reconcile these apparently conflicting findings, it has
been proposed that HCV core might have a dual action
on the TGF-b system depending on the phase of the
disease. Early in HCV infection, HCV core would
contribute to fibrogenesis by increasing TGF-b synth￾esis, and then, after long-term of fibrosis and inflamma￾tion and in the context of cirrhotic livers, HCV core
variants that contribute to clonal cell expansion and
cellular transformation by inhibiting TGF-b-dependent
antiproliferative pathways may arise and be selected
(Pavio et al., 2005).
Exogenously expressed HCV core protein associates
with cellular membranes (Barba et al., 1997; Hope et al.,
2002) and lipid vesicles (Moriya et al., 1997), binds to
apolipoprotein II (Sabile et al., 1999; Perlemuter et al.,
2002; Shi et al., 2002) and reduces microsomal
triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity, leading to
defects in the assembly and secretion of very-low-density
lipoproteins (Perlemuter et al., 2002) and steatosis. The
relevance in vivo of this interaction is supported by the
development of steatosis (Moriya et al., 1997; Perlemu￾ter et al., 2002) and liver cancer (Moriya et al., 2001;
Lerat et al., 2002) in transgenic mice expressing HCV
core.
E2 protein
The impact of other structural proteins on malignant
transformation is more indirect. The E2 glycoprotein
has been shown to interfere with interferon actions in
vitro by inhibition of protein kinase R (PKR), an
important intermediate of interferon effects (Taylor
et al., 1999; Crotta et al., 2002; Tseng and Klimpel,
2002). In addition, a soluble form of E2 (with the
transmembrane domain truncated) interacts specifically
with the cell surface marker CD81 and exerts inhibitory
effect on the activation of T and natural killer cells in
vitro (Crotta et al., 2002; Tseng and Klimpel, 2002). E2
interaction with CD81 as well as with the LDLR on the
cell surface activates the MAPK/extracellular signal￾regualted protein kinase (ERK) pathway, including the
downstream transcription factor ATF-2 and promotes
cell proliferation and cell survival (Zhao et al., 2005).
NS3
The NS3 serine protease domain alone can transform
mammalian cells, although the link between this
interaction and HCC is not clear (Sakamuro et al.,
1995). The oncogenic properties of NS3 may involve an
interaction with the tumor suppressor p53 (Ishido et al.,
1997; Ishido and Hotta, 1998). A portion near the
C-terminus of wt–p53 (amino acids 301–360), which has
been reported to contain the oligomerization domain, is
important for the complex formation with NS3 (Ishido
Viral hepatitis and liver cancer
M Levrero

Oncogene

and Hotta, 1998). The functional outcome of this
interaction is a dose-dependent NS3 repression of the
p21WAF1 gene transcription. NS3 also contains a histone￾binding site and binds histones H2B and H4 (Borowski
et al., 1999b). The NS3 protein modulates various
signal-transduction pathways that have transformation
potential. NS3 interacts with protein kinase A (PKA)
and inhibits its ability to translocate to the nucleus and
catalyse phosphorylation in response to stimulation
(Borowski et al., 1999b, c). Sequences in NS3 have been
show to serve as substrates for protein kinase C (PKC)
phosphorylation and can inhibit PKC signaling via
competition with normal substrates (Borowski et al.,
1999b, c). NS3 has also been shown to inhibit interferon
response factor (IRF)-3-mediated induction of type I
interferon in response to viral infection, which may be
important in the ability of HCV to escape immune
surveillance (Foy et al., 2003). Clearly, more work is
needed to characterize and critically evaluate these
interactions, particularly those requiring nuclear-loca￾lized NS3.
NS5A
NS5A has been implicated in diverse cellular functions,
including apoptosis, signal transduction, transcriptional
activation and cellular transformation. NS5A has widely
been studied for its potential role in blocking IRFs. In
vitro NS5A is apotent inhibitor of protein kinase R
activity (Gale et al., 1997). Although the initial studies
on PKR–NS5A interaction involved the expression of
NS5A in yeast or mammalian cells, a recent publication
has also observed some of these phenomena in the
context of an HCV replicon (Pflugheber et al., 2002).
Whether the interaction between NS5A and PKR
mediates interferon resistance in vivo remains unknown.
NS5A also induces interleukin-8, leading to the inhibi￾tion of the antiviral effects of IFN (Polyak et al., 2001).
The binding to the SNAP receptor (SNARE)-like
protein hVAPA (Tu et al., 1999) mediates NS5A
association to cellular membranes and its interaction
with lipid droplets (Shi et al., 2002), whereas the
interaction with the karyopherin b3 protein suggests a
role of NS5A nuclear import/transport phenomena
(Chung et al., 2000).
NS5A has been implicated both in the modulation of
cytoplasmic signaling pathways and in the regulation of
the cellular transcriptional machinery. Amino-terminal
NS5A–Gal4 fusion proteins have trans-activating prop￾erties (Tanimoto et al., 1997). Although intact NS5A is
cytoplasmic and membrane-bound (Brass et al., 2002),
caspase-mediated cleavage exposes a cryptic nuclear
localization signal (Ide et al., 1996) and leads to NS5A
nuclear localization, where it functions as a PKA￾regulated transcription factor (Satoh et al., 2000b; Goh
et al., 2001). Truncated versions of NS5A modulate
transcriptional. NS5A forms a heteromeric complex
with TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and tumor
suppressor protein p53 (Qadri et al., 2002). NS5A
inhibits the binding of both p53 and TBP to their DNA
consensus binding sequences in vitro and also inhibits
the p53–TBP and p53–excision repair cross comple￾menting factor 3 protein–protein complex formation
(Qadri et al., 2002). In addition, NS5A protein interacts
with and sequestrates hTAF(II)32 and hTAF(II)28,
components of TFIID and essential co-activators of
p53, in vivo (Otsuka et al., 2000; Lan et al., 2002). NS5A
and p53 co-localizes in the perinuclear region and the
functional consequence of these complex interactions is
the inhibition of both transcriptional transactivation by
p53 and p53-induced apoptosis (Ghosh et al., 2000;
Arima et al., 2001; Majumder et al., 2001; Lan et al.,
2002). Modulation of cell growth and differentiation by
the NS5A protein also occurs through its interaction
with the growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 adap￾tor protein (G2b2) (Tan et al., 1999) and with the CDK2
(Arima et al., 2001). In addition, NS5A protein binds
and activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),
resulting in the activation of both the downstream
effector serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B
and Akt-dependent survival pathways (Street et al.,
2004). More recently, it has been reported that NS5A
expression in the context of HCV polyprotein results in
the inhibition of the transcription factor Forkhead as
well as in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the
GSK-3, leading to accumulation of b-catenin and
stimulation of b-catenin-dependent transcription. It is
noteworthy that the HBV-encoded protein HBx also
activates the b-catenin pathway through an ERK￾mediated inactivation of GSK-3b (Ding et al., 2005).
This ERK-GSK-3b pathway is activated by IGF1,
TGF-b and deregulated tyrosine kinase receptor
HER2 activity, and it is responsible for b-catenin
upregulation in vivo not only in HCCs but also in
kidney, stomach and breast cancers (Ding et al., 2005).
Altogether, these observations strongly suggest that the
Wnt/b-catenin pathway is a common target for HCV
and HBV proteins (independently from axin/b-catenin
gene mutations) in human HCCs.
Hepatitis C virus, endoplasmic reticulum stress and
oxidative stress
Hepatitis C virus and other flaviviruses have been shown
to induce ER stress (Jordan et al., 2002; Tardif et al.,
2002; Waris et al., 2002). Endoplasmic reticulum stress is
a homeostatic mechanism that regulates cellular meta￾bolism and protein synthesis in response to perturba￾tions in protein folding and biosynthesis (Ma and
Hendershot, 2001). Mild ER stress modulates protein
synthesis initiation and causes a reduction in cell
growth, whereas extreme or prolonged ER stress leads
to apoptosis mediated by the activation of the ER￾associated caspase 12 (Kaufman, 1999). Although the
long-term consequences of low-level ER stress signaling
in the pathogenesis of HCV infection are not well
understood, it has been hypothesized that persistent ER
stress induction results in intra- and extracellular
accumulation of DNA-damaging factors that could
predispose acell to mutagenesis. Indeed, ER stress
signaling is intimately linked to changes in the
intracellular redox state. Markers of acute intracellular

oxidative stress are elevated in patients with chronic
HCV (Sumida et al., 2000) and they accumulate the
DNA adduct 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (Shimoda et al.,
1994). Transgenic mice expressing HCV core protein
show an increased accumulation of ROS that correlates
with HCC development (Moriya et al., 1998, 2001).
Transient expression of HCV NS5A alters intracellular
calcium levels, induces oxidative stress and activates
STAT-3 and NF-kB (Gong et al., 2001; Waris et al.,
2002). Oxidative stress activates intracellular signaling
pathways, including the MAPKs that can have pro￾found effects on cell growth regulation and may also
promote transformation.
Hepatitis C virus transgenic mice
The transgenic mouse system has widely been used to
study HCV proteins and carcinogenesis (Table 1).
Hepatitis C virus gene products have been expressed
either alone or in combination in the liver of transgenic
mice by using different liver-specific promoters. As
already mentioned, three different HCV core transgenic
lines develop liver steatosis and HCCs (Moriya et al.,
1997, 1998; Lerat et al., 2002); but other animals show
only steatosis (Perlemuter et al., 2002) or different
phenotypes (Okuda et al., 2002), depending on the
promoter used, the context of expression and the mouse
strain background. NS5A transgenic mice, in spite of the
pleiotropic functions of the protein in vitro, do not have
any significant phenotype (Majumder et al., 2002, 2003).
The transgenic mice reported so far in HCV transgenes
have always been expressed from constitutive promo￾ters. Besides from not being amenable to any postnatal
regulation, constitutive expression of HCV proteins
in utero may easily induce adaptive or compensatory
epigenetic that can profoundly affect the animal
phenotype.
Occult HBV infection
Cryptic or occult HBV infection is defined as the
persistence of HBV DNA into the liver (7serum) of
individuals negative for the HBsAg. This peculiar form
of infection occurs frequently in HCV-infected patients,
with the highest prevalence reported in Asian popula￾tions (reviewed by Torbenson and Thomas, 2002). In the
Mediterranean basin, about one-third of the patients
with chronic HCV carry such cryptic infection (Cacciola
et al., 1999; Pollicino et al., 2004). Most studies indicate
an increased frequency of cirrhosis in occult HBV￾infected patients, particularly if HCV co-infected
(Torbenson and Thomas, 2002). Cryptic HBV infection
is an important risk factor for the development of the
HCC in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis (Pollicino
et al., 2004; Squadrito et al., 2006). As occult HBV may
persist in the infected livers both in integrated and
episomal forms (Pollicino et al., 2004), it may contribute
to hepatocellular transformation through the same
mechanisms traditionally considered the basis of the
tumorigenic properties of the HBV, including the
capacity of the integrated virus to rearrange the host
genome and the potential pro-oncogenic activity of the
X protein that shares many molecular targets with
HCV core and NS5A, including the ERK kinases, the
b-catenin pathway, NF-kB and p53.
Gene expression profile in hepatitis C virus-related
hepatocellular carcinomas
Expression profile analysis of HCC samples by com￾parative gene expression clustering has identified a
number of transcripts ‘upregulated’ (mainly cell growth
genes) or ‘downregulated’ (mainly growth inhibition
genes) in HCC tissues (Okabe et al., 2001; Shirota et al.,
2001; Chen et al., 2002; Lee and Thorgeirsson, 2002;
Smith et al., 2003; Ye et al., 2003; Breuhahn et al., 2004;
Lee et al., 2004; Neo et al., 2004; Nam et al., 2005; Patil
et al., 2005; Thorgeirsson et al., 2006). Examples,
derived from several studies, of genes whose transcripts
are prominently altered, in HCCs relative to non￾cancerous liver tissue, include cyclin gene family
members, CDC20, CDK4, myb homologs, members of
the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, as well as many matrix
metalloproteinases. Downregulation was observed for
many genes involved with biotransformation, such as

glutathione transferases (Zhou et al., 1997), monoamine
oxidases and cytochrome genes (Xu et al., 2001;
Kinoshita and Miyajima, 2002). A number of over￾expressed genes encoding for secreted (e.g., GPC3,
LCN2 and DKK1) or membrane-bound proteins (e.g.,
GPC3, IGSF1 and PSK-1), which may be attractive
candidates for the diagnosis of HCC, have also been
identified (Patil et al., 2005). In the analysis of 102
tumors from 82 HBV and HCV patients, Chen et al. did
not find any consistent distinction between the two
groups, whereas other studies could identify at least
some distinctive trends between HBV- and HCV-related
HCCs (Iizuka et al., 2002; Delpuech et al., 2002).
However, as for the study of viral genes, no specific gene
signature has been found that might clearly explain as to
how HBV or HCV mediates oncogenesis.
Concluding remarks
Hepatocyte transformation most often occurs in
the setting of chronic liver injury, regeneration and
cirrhosis. Increased cell turnover in this context of
inflammation and oxidative DNA damage facilitates the
accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations
that include the activation of cellular oncogenes
and proliferative pathways, telomerase activation, the
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, the over￾expression of growth and angiogenic factors.
A central question in HCC research over the last two
decades has been whether HCV (and HBV), which
account together for the majority of HCC cases world￾wide, play an additional direct role in the molecular
pathogenesis of HCC, besides their ability to trigger
chronic inflammation in the liver. An overwhelming
amount of information is now available regarding
functions and properties of different HCV-encoded
proteins, namely HCV core, E2, NS3 and NS5A, that
are potentially relevant for HCC development and
tumor progression. However, it is important to under￾line that most, if not all, of the putative transforming
functions of HCV proteins have been defined and
characterized in systems that are artificial, with high￾level expression of the viral proteins. Thus, these in vitro
findings may not be applicable to infection in vivo,
where HCV proteins are expressed in much lower
concentrations, and the true biologic relevance of these

Figure 4 The Wnt pathway is targeted by genetic and epigenetic events in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinomas
(HCCs). b-Catenin accumulation in human HCC may be triggered by multiple mechanisms. Activating mutations of b-catenin and
Axin1 gene mutations occur in a substantial proportion of HCC patients but do not account for all HCC cases with b-catenin nuclear
accumulation. Frizzled type 7 receptor (Fzd-7) is overexpressed in many human HCCs and induces wild-type b-catenin stabilization/
activation. Hepatitis C virus core protein upregulates transcription of several growth-related genes, including wnt-1 that is secreted and
activates signaling through the frizzled receptors. NS5A activates the PI3K that in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), leading to the accumulation of b-catenin and stimulation of b-catenin-dependent transcription.
Interestingly, the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded protein HBx also activates the b-catenin pathway through an extracellular signal￾regulated protein kinase (ERK)-mediated inactivation of GSK-3b. Activated b-catenin increases transcription of several target genes
that control cell proliferation, including cyclin D1 and c-myc. b-Catenin also potentiate the expression of DN-p73, a dominant￾negative p73 isoform that act as a dominant trans-repressor of both p53 and proapoptotic TAp73 proteins and confers to HCC cells a
chemoresistant phenotype. Thus, in human HCCs, the Wnt/b-catenin pathway is a common target for HCV (and HBV) proteins,
independently from axin/b-catenin gene mutations. Conversely, b-catenin-dependent overexpression of DNp73 leads to p53 and
TAp73 functional inactivation without requiring the selection of p53 gene-inactivating mutations.

observations remains still to be established in relevant
infection and disease models. Indeed, despite all the
evidence accumulated, we still do not know whether,
and which, viral gene products are necessary in vivo for
the establishment of HCCs. Another open question is
whether and at what point in the development of HCC
cancer become independent of the virus, as the relatively
low and slow impact on HCC development of successful
antiviral treatments in HCV patients with already
established cirrhosis would suggest. Although many
studies have now outlined a number of genetic and
functional differences between HBV- and HCV-related
HCCs, much more work is still needed to define whether
the heterogeneity of etiological factors implicated in the
development of HCC translates into specific genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms that may be also be detected as
specific molecular signatures. Systematic search for all
genetic and epigenetic alterations in large series of
tumors, including all grade, stages, etiologies and also
pre-neoplastic lesions certainly need to be performed.
However, to gain a deeper understanding of the basic
mechanisms that control and determine HCC transcrip￾tome and HCC phenotype, descriptive (phenotypic)
oncogenomics has proven only partially useful and must
be integrated with multiple and innovative functional
approaches. From the dissection of the molecular and
signaling pathways that may be, according to in vitro
experiments and animal models, or are altered in human
HCCs and/or in subsets of HCC patients, we must now
progress to understand how these pathways build-up
more complex networks that are relevant for transfor￾mation. An example of successful integration of old and
new data generated with different approaches into a
larger network is the emerging connection between
viral proteins, components of the Wnt/b-catenin and
members of the p53 family (Street et al., 2005; Muller
et al., 2005; Fukutomi et al., 2005; Palescandolo et al.,
2006) (Figure 4). Combining genomewide and func￾tional approaches will lead not only to a better
understanding of the cellular events involved in hepa￾tocyte transformation but also in all likelihood to
improve preventive measures and innovative therapies
for one of the most devastating human malignancies in
the world today.
