meningitis and one of septicaemia in man caused by haemolytic
streptococci. Further strains have been isolated from man by several
workers, and Kloppenburg et a14 drew attention to the fact that all 15
reported cases had occurred in the Netherlands or Denmark and
nearly all were of purulent meningitis. One patient kept pigs on his
own premises for future processing in the factory, and the actual
source of his infection was not identified. The incubation period,
however, indicated that infection had resulted from his injury. Swabs
from the machine and other apparatus at the factory were unobtain￾able and swabs from the patient's hand wound taken the day after
admission failed to grow streptococci. Most previous cases have
resulted from an infected wound. Purulent arthritis is a well known
complication of group R streptococcal infection in pigs but as yet has
not been recorded in man. Unfortunately our patient's hip was
aspirated too late in the course of his illness to isolate the infecting
organism, which was presumably a streptococcus.
We thank the staff of the Public Health Laboratory, Gloucester, for the
initial investigations, the staff of the Cross-infection Reference Laboratory,
Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, London, for specialist advice,
and Dr R F Jarrett for permission to report this case. The case reported
here is referred to by Windsor and Elliott5 in a footnote to their paper on
streptococcal infection in young pigs.

Low molecular weight dextran:
a continuing cause of acute
renal failure
Low molecular weight dextran (LMWD), though not usually con￾sidered to be highly nephrotoxic, may precipitate acute renal failure
(ARF) in certain conditions.' It may be the commonest cause of drug￾induced ARF. Seven out of eight cases of drug-induced ARF referred
to this unit from several hospitals during a recent eight-month
period were caused by LMWD (10,, dextran 40 in six cases and 6',
dextran 70 in one case). All seven patients had ischaemic disorders.

Case histories
The case histories of patients are summarised in the table. In none could
any cause other than LMWD be found for the ARF. All had widespread
arterial disease and possibly such patients are particularly sensitive to the
nephrotoxic effects of LMWD. In every case the onset of renal failure was
relatively slow with a progressive decline in urire volume over three to six
days. This was well illustrated by case 2, whose sequential daily urine
volumes from the start of LMWD treatment were (in ml) 1900, 1000, 800,
650, 155, 0. Circulatory overload developed during this period.
Despite the decline in urine output LMWD was not withdrawn from any
of the patients, and five developed complete anuria. During recovery there
was not, as in many cases of ARF, a rapid diuresis but a slow rise in urine
volume of 100-300 ml/day. Only two patients (3 and 6) achieved a diuresis
of greater than 2 1/day. Dextran did not help the primary condition of any of
the patients.
Comment
Dextrans of molecular weights below 60 000 easily filter through
the glomerulus. They may accumulate in proximal tubular cells giving
the swollen, vacuolated appearance of "osmotic nephropathy,"
although this appearance does not correlate with changes in renal
function. The high viscosity of concentrated dextran probably causes
renal dysfunction by tubular plugging. I Damage is more likely to
occur when renal perfusion is reduced' 4-a probable factor in cases
2, 4, and 7-or if renal damage is already present,' as in patients 2 and
6. Maintenance of diuresis with fluids and diuretics may protect the
kidneys-' and may have prevented the need for dialysis in cases 4 and 6,
who were referred and treated before anuria occurred.
Except in cases 1 and 5 the total dosage of LMWD was within the
accepted therapeutic range, but treatment was continued despite
falling urine volumes. The occurrence of anuria with 6",, dextran 70
in patient 7 is unusual, as only a small proportion of the dextrans in
this solution are filtered through the glomerulus.
The uses of LMWD are limited. When it is indicated its propensity
to cause ARF should be remembered and the following therapeutic
rules observed5: (1) do not infuse faster than 1 1/day; (2) do not give
if the urine output is below 1500 ml/day; (3) withdraw if the specific
gravity of the urine rises above 1045; (4) do not give if the blood urea
is above 10 mmol/l (60 mg/100 ml). A reduced urine output indicates
that LMWD should be withdrawn and diuresis induced with diuretics
and a high fluid intake.
Strict adherence to these rules would probably have prevented all
the cases of LMWD-induced renal failure reported here.
