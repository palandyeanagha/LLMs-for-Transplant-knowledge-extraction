Abstract
Background: Whereas ICU-acquired weakness may delay extubation in mechanically ventilated patients, its
influence on extubation failure is poorly known. This study aimed at assessing the role of ICU-acquired weakness on
extubation failure and the relation between limb weakness and cough strength.
Methods: A secondary analysis of two previous prospective studies including patients at high risk of reintubation
after a planned extubation, i.e., age greater than 65 years, with underlying cardiac or respiratory disease, or
intubated for more than 7 days prior to extubation. Patients intubated less than 24 h and those with a do-not￾reintubate order were not included. Limb and cough strength were assessed by a physiotherapist just before
extubation. ICU-acquired weakness was clinically diagnosed as limb weakness defined as Medical Research Council
(MRC) score < 48 points and severe weakness as MRC sum-score < 36. Cough strength was assessed using a semi￾quantitative 5-Likert scale. Extubation failure was defined as reintubation or death within the first 7 days following
extubation.
Results: Among 344 patients at high risk of reintubation, 16% experienced extubation failure (56/344). They had
greater severity and lower MRC sum-score (41 ± 16 vs. 49 ± 13, p < 0.001) and were more likely to have ineffective
cough than the others. The prevalence of ICU-acquired weakness at the time of extubation was 38% (130/244). The
extubation failure rate was 12% (25/214) in patients with no limb weakness vs. 18% (12/65) and 29% (19/65) in
those with moderate and severe limb weakness, respectively (p < 0.01). MRC sum-score and cough strength were
weakly but significantly correlated (rho = 0.28, p < .001). After multivariate logistic regression analyses, the lower the
MRC sum-score the greater the risk of reintubation; severe limb weakness was independently associated with
extubation failure, even after adjustment on cough strength and severity at admission.
Conclusion: ICU-acquired weakness was diagnosed in 38% in this population of patients at high risk at the time of
extubation and was independently associated with extubation failure in the ICU.

Background
The decision of extubation is a critical moment in the ICU
because mortality is particularly high in case of extubation
failure leading to reintubation [1, 2]. The overall rate of
reintubation after planned extubation is around 10% but
may exceed 20% in some subsets of patients [1, 2]. Identifi￾cation of patients at high risk of reintubation deserves con￾sideration in order to apply specific measures that may
prevent reintubation. The most recent international clinical
practice guidelines recommend the use of non-invasive
ventilation immediately after extubation to prevent respira￾tory failure in patients at high risk of reintubation [3]. In
patients older than 65 years or having any underlying car￾diac or respiratory disease, a recent large randomized clin￾ical trial showed that a combination of high-flow nasal
oxygen alternating with non-invasive ventilation was the
most efficient strategy to prevent reintubation [4, 5].
In addition to patient characteristics, other factors ac￾quired during the ICU stay, such as ICU-acquired weakness
or inability to clear secretions, may also be associated with
increased risk of extubation failure. Several studies have
shown that ineffective cough at the time of extubation is a
strong predictor of reintubation [6–17]. Ineffective cough is
mainly due to altered expiratory muscle function including
at varying degrees of the diaphragm, accessory respiratory
muscles, and abdominal muscles [18, 19]. ICU-acquired
weakness combining polyneuropathy, myopathy, and
muscle atrophy [20–22] is clinically diagnosed as limb par￾esis but may affect all respiratory muscles with an altered
inspiratory and expiratory strength, as well pharyngeal
muscles, and which can lead to overall respiratory muscle
weakness [23, 24] and to swallowing disorders [25].
Whereas ICU-acquired weakness may lead to difficult
weaning and delayed extubation in mechanically venti￾lated patients [23, 24, 26–28], few studies have assessed its
role in extubation failure [29, 30]. To our knowledge, only
one study has reported that patients with limb weakness
have higher reintubation rates than others [30], but cough
strength, a potential confounding factor, was not assessed,
making the results uncertain.
Whether ICU-acquired weakness is a real risk factor for
reintubation is unknown. Therefore, the primary objective
of this study was to assess the influence of ICU-acquired
weakness on extubation failure, in patients at high risk of
reintubation in the ICU. Secondary objectives included as￾sessment of the other factors associated with extubation
failure, especially cough strength, and the relationship be￾tween limb weakness and cough strength.
Methods
Study design and participants
This is a secondary analysis of two previous prospective
studies assessing extubation outcome in the ICU [15, 16].
The first study was a prospective monocenter cohort
conducted in a teaching hospital between November 2010
and April 2012 [15]. The second was a prospective multi￾center study conducted in three ICUs between March
2015 and October 2016 [16].
In the present study, only patients at high risk of reintu￾bation were retained in the analysis, i.e., patients older
than 65 years, with underlying chronic cardiac or respira￾tory disease, or intubated for more than 7 days prior to
extubation [15, 31, 32]. Underlying chronic cardiac disease
included left ventricular dysfunction whatever the cause
defined by left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%, history
of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, documented ischemic
heart disease, or permanent atrial fibrillation. Underlying
chronic lung disease included chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or re￾strictive pulmonary disease. Patients with limb weakness
prior to ICU admission, patients intubated less than 24 h
in the ICU, and those with a do-not-reintubate order upon
extubation were not included. Post hoc analysis of data of
the two original studies was approved by the two Ethics
Committees (CPP Ile-de-France IX and CPP Sud-Est II).
Weaning procedure
The decision to extubate was made by the attending phys￾ician in patients fulfilling all the weaning criteria after pass￾ing a spontaneous breathing trial [33]. Weaning criteria
were considered as follows: respiratory rate ≤ 35 breaths
per minute, adequate oxygenation defined as SpO2 > 90%
with FiO2 ≤ 0.4 or PaO2/FiO2 > 150 mmHg with positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≤ 8 cmH2O, patient awake
with a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale [34] between +
1 and − 2, no continuous sedation, and no need for vaso￾pressors. The spontaneous breathing trial was performed
either with T-piece or with low levels of pressure-support
(PS 7 cmH2O) without positive end-expiratory pressure for
1h[33].
Failure of the spontaneous breathing trial was defined
according to the usual criteria of the international con￾ference consensus on weaning from mechanical ventila￾tion as the development during the trial of any of the
following events [33]: respiratory rate > 35 breaths/min,
increased accessory muscle activity, SpO2 persistently
below 90% (on FiO2 0.4 or at least 6 L/min of oxygen),
heart rate persistently above 140 beats/min, systolic
blood pressure below 90 or above 180 mmHg, or appear￾ance of cyanosis or mottling, depressed mental status, or
agitation.
Clinical assessment of ICU-acquired weakness
Limb muscle and cough strength, as well as the amount
of secretions, were assessed by a physiotherapist blind to
the patient’s medical condition just before extubation.
The inability to manage secretions, potentially leading to
postponed extubation, was considered in patients with
Thille et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:86 Page 2 of 9

both ineffective cough and abundant secretions. Limb
muscle strength was assessed using the Medical Re￾search Council (MRC) score for the three muscle groups
of each limb, with an overall score ranging from 0 (total
paralysis) to 60 (normal muscle strength); ICU-acquired
weakness was defined as an MRC sum-score less than
48, and severe weakness as a sum-score less than 36
[35–37]. Cough strength was assessed both at order and
at suctioning and scored using a semi-quantitative 5-
Likert scale as previously reported in other studies [13,
17]. It was graded 0 (absent), 1 (weak and ineffective), 2
(moderate), 3 (good and effective), or 4 (strong and very
effective) and then defined as “ineffective” for a score of
0 to 1. Likewise, sputum amount was graded from 0 to 4
according to the following definition: 0 (absence), 1 (low
quantity), 2 (moderate quantity), 3 (abundant), or 4 (very
abundant) and then defined as “abundant” for a score of
3 to 4.
Outcome
The primary outcome was extubation failure defined as
reintubation or death within the first 7 days following
extubation.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation (SD) or median [25th–75th percentiles], and
qualitative variables were expressed as number and percent￾age. Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t
test or the Mann-Whitney U test according to their distri￾bution and categorical variables were compared using the
chi-squared test or the Fischer’s exact test as appropriate.
Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to assess time from
extubation to reintubation or death within the 7 days fol￾lowing extubation and were compared by means of the log￾rank test between patients with ineffective cough and the
others and between patients with no ICU-acquired weak￾ness and those with moderate or severe limb weakness.
Variables associated with extubation failure were assessed
by means of multivariate logistic regression analyses. A
backward manual selection procedure was performed for
the maximal model using all factors associated with extuba￾tion failure with a p value < 0.15. Interactions were tested
before performing the multivariate logistic regression and
we verified that there was no multi-collinearity. The final
model included variables significantly associated with extu￾bation failure. We planned to analyze at least 50 extubation
failure events, i.e., at least 300 extubations based on an
extubation failure rate around 15–20%, in order to poten￾tially enter at least the 5 following variables into the max￾imal model: severity at admission, duration of mechanical
ventilation prior to extubation, ICU-acquired weakness, in￾effective cough, and abundant secretions.
The correlation between MRC sum-score and cough
strength was computed using the Spearman’s rank cor￾relation test. A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance. We used
SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and R software
(available online at http://www.R-project.org) for all the
analyses.
Results
Study population
Of the 416 patients included in the two prospective
studies, 72 were excluded because they were at low-risk
of extubation failure (n = 52) or had no assessment of
cough strength or limb muscle strength (n = 20). As a re￾sult, 344 patients at high risk of reintubation were
retained in the final analysis (see the figure showing a
flow chart of the patients in the Additional file 1). Me￾dian duration of mechanical ventilation prior to extuba￾tion was 7 days (IQR 3–12]. All in all, 226 patients (66%)
had underlying chronic cardiac or lung disease, 220 pa￾tients (64%) were older than 65 years, and 155 (45%) had
been intubated for more than 7 days prior to extubation,
including 47 patients (14%) of less than 65 years without
any underlying cardiac or lung disease.
Factors associated with extubation failure
The proportion of patients with extubation failure (reintu￾bation or death at day 7) was 16% (56 out of 344 patients)
(Table 1). Among them, 53 were reintubated and 3 pa￾tients died without reintubation within the 7 days follow￾ing extubation. The main reason for reintubation was
severe respiratory failure in 77% of patients (41/53). Pa￾tients who failed extubation were more severe, as indi￾cated by higher SAPS II at admission, and had been
intubated for a longer duration prior to extubation than
those who succeeded extubation. They also had lower
MRC sum-score and were more likely to have severe limb
weakness, ineffective cough, and abundant secretions.
ICU-acquired weakness was diagnosed in 130 out of the
344 patients (38%) and was classified as severe in half of
them (65 out of 130 patients). Extubation failure rate was
12% (25 out of 214 patients) in patients with no limb
muscle weakness compared with 18% (12 out of 65 pa￾tients) in those with moderate limb weakness and 29% (19
out of 65 patients) in those with severe limb weakness
(p = 0.003 using chi-squared test and p = 0.004 using log￾rank test) (Fig. 1). Cough was classified as ineffective in 27
patients (8%). The extubation failure rate was 41% (11 out
of 27 patients) in patients with ineffective cough vs. 5% (16
out of 317 patients) in patients with effective or moderate
cough strength (p < 0.001 using chi-squared test and log￾rank test) (Fig. 2). MRC sum-score and cough strength
were weakly but significantly correlated (rho = 0.28,
p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). ICU-acquired weakness was diagnosed
Thille et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:86 Page 3 of 9

in 78% (21/27) among patients with ineffective cough as
compared to 34% (109/317) in those with effective cough
or moderate (p < 0.001). Cough was ineffective in 23% (15/
65) among patients with severe limb weakness as compared
to 9% (6/65) in those with moderate limb weakness and 3%
(6/214) in those with no limb weakness (p = 0.001).
Multivariate analysis
According to the multivariate logistic regression model,
low MRC sum-score, ineffective cough, and high severity
score at ICU admission were the three variables inde￾pendently associated with extubation failure. The lower
the MRC sum-score the greater the risk of reintubation.

By replacing MRC sum-score (continuous variable) with
limb weakness as a categorical variable in the model, se￾vere but not moderate limb weakness and ineffective
cough were the two factors independently associated
with extubation failure after adjustment on severity score
at ICU admission (Table 2).
Discussion
In this post hoc analysis, pooling two prospective studies
ICU-acquired weakness (prevalence 38%) was a strong
predictor of extubation failure. The lower the MRC sum￾score the greater the risk of extubation failure while severe
limb weakness was independently associated with extuba￾tion failure, even after adjustment on cough strength and
disease severity.
Influence of ICU-acquired weakness on extubation failure
In addition to limbs, ICU-acquired weakness may affect
respiratory muscles and lead to subsequent weaning diffi￾culties and prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation

[23, 24, 26–28]. However, the actual influence of ICU￾acquired weakness on extubation outcome has been
poorly studied. In a previous study, critical illness poly￾neuropathy was diagnosed using an electromyogram in 64
patients with sepsis [29]. The rate of reintubation was 41%
among patients with polyneuropathy and 13% in the
others (p < 0.05), but there was no clinical assessment of
limb muscle strength. In another study including 377
critically ill patients, the authors found that the lower the
MRC sum-score the higher the risk of reintubation within
the 7 days after extubation [30]. However, MRC sum￾score was measured only for the elbows and knees with an
overall score ranging from 0 to 20 points, and limb weak￾ness was considered for a score below 10 points. Unlike
this study, we measured MRC sum-score according to the
usual method with an overall sum-score ranging from 0 to

60 points. Limb weakness was considered according to the
usual threshold in patients with a MRC sum-score below
48 points [21, 35–37], while severe limb weakness was
considered in patients with a MRC sum-score below 36
points [36], these scores having shown a good interob￾server agreement. Moreover, cough strength was not
assessed in these previous studies and could have been a
confounding factor making the results uncertain. Indeed,
assessment of cough strength is essential to determine the
respective role of ineffective cough and ICU-acquired
weakness in extubation failure.
Coughing mechanics are mainly determined by the
contraction of expiratory muscles, especially abdominal
muscles, and effective closure of the glottis [18, 19, 38,
39]. Cough strength was significantly correlated with
limb strength and consequently, ineffective cough was
uncommon in patients with no limb weakness. Respira￾tory muscle weakness is frequently associated with limb
weakness [23, 24, 27], and altered expiratory strength
may explain ineffective cough in patients with limb
weakness. However, the majority of patients with severe
limb weakness had effective cough. ICU-acquired weak￾ness may affect all inspiratory/expiratory muscles and
even pharyngeal muscles, which could lead to respiratory
failure due to altered overall respiratory muscle strength
[23, 24, 27] or to swallowing disorders [25], even in pa￾tients with adequate cough. This study demonstrates
that ICU-acquired weakness clinically assessed by limb
strength using an easy and usual score at bedside was in￾dependently associated with extubation failure. However,
only severe but not moderate limb weakness was actually
associated with extubation failure, even after adjustment
on cough strength.
Our study pooled two prospective studies in which both
ICU-acquired weakness and ineffective cough were signifi￾cantly associated with extubation failure using univariate
analysis [15, 16]. However, after multivariate logistic re￾gression, ineffective cough remained independently associ￾ated with extubation failure whereas this was not the case
for limb weakness. This result was probably due to a lack
of power in the abovementioned studies. Indeed, by pool￾ing the two studies, cough strength and limb weakness
both remained independently associated with extubation
failure, even after adjustment on severity score.
Strength and weakness of the study
Limitations of this study include its post hoc design and
inherent bias and the absence of an objective measure￾ment of cough strength. Cough strength was assessed by
a physiotherapist using a semi-quantitative scale, and
such subjective assessment of cough could limit external
validity, especially for reproducibility of measurement
and applicability in other centers. Moreover, as physio￾therapists assessed both limb and cough strength, the
prior diagnosis of limb weakness might have influenced
subjective assessment of cough strength. However, sev￾eral studies have reported an increased risk of extuba￾tion failure in patients with ineffective cough [6–17],
whether cough is subjectively assessed using a semi￾quantitative scale as our study [13–17] or objectively
assessed by measuring cough peak flow using a spirom￾eter [6–11, 16, 17], or measured using change in intra￾abdominal pressure during tracheal aspirations [12]. In
one of the previous studies, cough strength assessed
using a semi-quantitative scale was significantly associ￾ated with extubation failure whereas cough peak flow
was not, suggesting that the subjective assessment of
cough strength might be more relevant than a single
point measurement with a spirometer [16]. Cough peak
flow is only one of the determinants of cough efficacy,
and its measurement enables assessment only of volun￾tary cough strength which requires patients’ cooperation
and may be a major limitation in ICU patients [6–11,
16, 17]. By contrast, semi-quantitative scales combine
voluntary cough strength and involuntary cough
strength during aspirations and could be assessed in all
patients at the time of extubation [13–17]. Nevertheless,
lastly, regardless of cough assessment method, physio￾logical effective cough requires hermetic closure of the
glottis which is not possible in an intubated patient.
Another limitation is that we did not assess respiratory
muscle strength. Although the severity of limb weakness
seems weakly correlated with diaphragm dysfunction,
the majority of patients with ICU-acquired limb weak￾ness (60 to 80%) have respiratory muscle weakness [23,
27]. The increased risk of extubation failure in patients
with ICU-acquired weakness may be directly linked to
respiratory muscle weakness. We previously found that
diaphragm dysfunction assessed by ultrasound was not
associated with an increased risk of extubation failure
[16]. However, the overall respiratory muscle strength
obviously depends not only on the diaphragm, but also
on accessory respiratory muscles that could have a major
role in patients at high risk of respiratory failure. That
said, the assessment of limb weakness may be easy at
bedside and seems to be a strong predictor of extubation
failure, with no other measurement of respiratory
muscle function. Last, measurement reliability of MRC
sum-score has mainly been assessed in cooperative pa￾tients and could less accurate in patients still asleep or
with delirium [40].
Strengths of the study include a prospective collection
of data with a weaning protocol to assess readiness for
extubation and systematic assessment of limb weakness
by a physiotherapist before extubation. Moreover, the
focus of the study on a homogeneous population of pa￾tients at high risk of reintubation may help to better
generalize these results to other ICUs.

The study suggests that systematic assessment of ICU￾acquired weakness using MRC sum-score should be
daily integrated in the decision to extubate, in order to
identify patients at high risk and to apply an appropriate
strategy of ventilatory support after extubation. Prophy￾lactic non-invasive ventilation immediately after extuba￾tion may be an optimal strategy of oxygenation to avoid
reintubation in patients at high risk of extubation failure
[4, 5]. Likewise, prophylactic non-invasive ventilation
may be beneficial by avoiding reintubation in patients
with ineffective cough, whereas it seems to have no
beneficial effects in those with effective cough [10].
However, whether the application of non-invasive venti￾lation is efficient in patients with ICU-acquired weakness
calls for further research.
Conclusions
In our study, severe limb weakness and ineffective cough
were both independently associated with extubation fail￾ure in patients at high risk of reintubation, even after ad￾justment on severity.
