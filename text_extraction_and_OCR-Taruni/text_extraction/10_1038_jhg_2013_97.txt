Organic acidemias (OAs) are rare inborn errors of metabolism. The clinical presentations of methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)
and propionic acidemia (PA) in Japan have not yet been examined in detail. We aimed to investigate the clinical presentations
of OAs in Japan and evaluate current therapies for improving long-term outcomes, especially in MMA and PA cases.
Questionnaires were sent to 928 institutions in 2009 inquiring about OAs, and secondary questionnaires were sent to those
who confirmed that they had diagnosed and/or treated such cases; 119 cases were eventually included for analysis. In Japan,
the majority of OAs was MMA, which was associated with a high mortality rate. The survival rates at 20 years of age in vitamin
B12-unresponsive MMA, vitamin B12-responsive MMA and PA patients were 69.8%, 94.4% and 95.8%, respectively. Factors
associated with mortality in MMA were failure to thrive, hypoglycemia and pancreatitis. Factors associated with mental
retardation in vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA, vitamin B12-responsive MMA, and PA were seizure and liver dysfunction,
seizure and failure to thrive, and failure to thrive, respectively. We advocated that avoiding failure to thrive due to too restricted
protein diet, hypoglycemia and pancreatitis associated with mortality lead to improve outcome, especially in vitamin B12-
unresponsive MMA patients.

INTRODUCTION
Organic acidemias (OAs) are rare inborn errors of metabolism that can
be life-threatening and have severe complications.1 In Japan, studies
have focused on the long-term outcomes of inherited metabolic diseases,
such as urea cycle disorders and glycogen storage disease.2,3 As OAs
usually present with common symptoms due to metabolic acidosis,
early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for obtaining
optimal outcomes. In the diagnosis of OAs, gas chromatography mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) is typically used to analyze urinary organic acids.
Furthermore, in recent years, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has
also become available for newborn screening (NBS) and advanced
metabolic tests, which are performed as indicated based on family
history and/or routine laboratory test results.4–8
Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) are
the most frequent types of organic acid metabolism disorders and
are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. These conditions are
caused by severe inborn errors of catabolism of the amino acids
isoleucine, valine, methionine and threonine, as well as metabolism of
odd-chain fatty acids and cholesterol side chains. MMA is characterized
by an abnormal accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA and methylmalonic
acid. It is caused by a defect of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
(MCM) or a defect in the synthesis of 50
-deoxyadenosylcobalamin,
which is the cofactor of MCM (cblA, cblB, cblD).1 Moreover, some
disorders involving methylcobalamin metabolism result in MMA
and homocysteinuria (cblC, cblD, cblF). The deficiencies of MCM
are subdivided into mut0, with complete loss of MCM activity, and
mut , with partial residual activity. Clinically, vitamin B12-
responsive MMA is considered when a patient with MMA
responds effectively to vitamin B12 supplementation and exhibits
a defective synthesis of cobalamin and the presence of a part of
mut . In contrast, vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA is considered
when a patient with MMA responds poorly to vitamin B12
supplementation and exhibits the presence of mut0 or a residual
part of mut . PA is characterized by an abnormal accumulation
of propionic acid and metabolites such as methylcitrate,
3-hydroxypropionic acid and propionyl glycine. It is caused by
a defect of the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), which
converts propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA.
The clinical presentations of MMA and PA can be similar in many
ways. Most patients with the early-onset type present in the neonatal

period, within 1 month after birth, with nonspecific signs such as
appetite loss, recurrent vomiting, lethargy, hypotonia and tachypnea.
Some patients have more severe complications such as hyperammo￾nemia, seizure, deep coma and death. Patients with the late-onset type
have similar clinical pictures as the early-onset type and can be
diagnosed with failure to thrive and/or developmental delay. Regard￾less of the time of onset, decompensation, manifesting as impaired
consciousness, can be life-threatening and indicates a severe clinical
condition.5
Treatment options include a restricted protein diet to reduce the
levels of harmful amino acids in affected patients. Moreover, admin￾istration of antibiotics can result in a reduction in the propionate
produced from gut bacteria. Arginine and sodium benzoate are also
prescribed to treat hyperammonemia. Hemodialysis must be imple￾mented without delay. Carnitine supplementation is effective to
release trapped CoA and prevent secondary carnitine deficiency.9
However, as there is no specific therapy for MMA and PA, patients
who recover from decompensation often experience neurologic
sequelae. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the clinical
presentations of organic acidemias in Japan and evaluate current
therapies for improving long-term outcome, especially in cases with
MMA and PA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Life
Science, Kumamoto University. In 2009, a questionnaire was sent to 928
institutions, including the Departments of Pediatrics, Neonatology, Genetics,
and Transplant surgery, asking doctors if they diagnosed or provided medical
care to OAs patients. In response, 201 institutions confirmed that they had
diagnosed and/or treated inborn errors of metabolism. A secondary detailed
questionnaire concerning OAs was then sent to these 201 institutions, of which
41 responded. In 2012, we conducted follow-up research to reveal outcome. In
total, 119 cases of OAs were collected. The definition of clinical manifestations
of OAs used in this study was the same as that previously described.3 In
addition, mental retardation was diagnosed if the patient’s intelligence quotient
was o70, in standardized tests, such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics 21.0. Descriptive and inferential
statistics were used in this study. Significance of differences was assessed using
the Mann–Whitney U-test or Kruskal–Wallis test. For data with small values,
the Fisher exact test was used for a more precise P-value. Independence was
tested using the chi-square test. Mortality rates were compared using Kaplan–
Meier analysis with the logrank test.
RESULTS
General characteristics
Characteristics of affected individuals were shown in Table 1. There
were 17 deaths, including 10 patients with vitamin B12-unresponsive
MMA (58.8%), 2 with vitamin B12-responsive MMA (11.8%) and 1
with MMA whose response to vitamin B12 was unknown (Table 1).
The deceased patients comprised 13 of 65 MMA patients and 2 of 30
PA patients. There was statistical difference in survival rates. In 2012,
at a subsequent follow-up, the median age of all patients with OAs
was 128 months (interquartile range (IQR), 68.3–191.8). There was
no significant difference in age distribution between MMA and PA
patients. The median age of the 17 deceased patients was
11 months (IQR, 11–84 months; range, 5 days to 23 years). There
was also no significant difference in sex between MMA and PA
patients. The number of all male OA patients was 55 (46%). In
Table 2, characteristics of onset and diagnosis of OAs were shown.
NBS by MS/MS and advanced metabolic tests were used to diagnose
11 and 4 cases, respectively (vitamin B12-responsive MMA, 1 and 3
cases; vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA, 1 and 0 case; PA, 7 and 1
cases; HCS deficiency, 1 and 0 case; and 3MCC deficiency, 1 and 0
case, respectively). In those cases, 12 cases were already treated with
some kinds of drugs before onset (vitamin B12-responsive MMA, 4;
vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA, 1; PA, 6; HCS deficiency, 1; and
3MCC deficiency, 0). There was no significant difference in the age of
onset between MMA and PA patients; however, patients with vitamin
B12-responsive MMA had a lower rate (33%) of onset within a
month of life (data not shown).
We received 116 valid responses concerning the method(s) of
diagnosis. There were similar diagnostic tools available in each
institution. Nearly all patients (n ¼ 113, 97.4%) underwent analysis
of urinary organic acids using gas chromatography mass spectrometry
(GC/MS). Other available methods used were tandem mass spectro￾metry (MS/MS) (n ¼ 38, 32.8%), enzyme activity measurement
(n ¼ 47, 40.5%) and genetic analysis (n ¼ 16, 13.8%). Three cases of
PA were diagnosed using enzyme activity measurement, genetic
analysis and MS/MS without GC/MS. In this study, the detailed
results of enzyme activity measurement and genetic analysis could not
be collected; however, in previous reports, some kinds of OAs had

relationship between genotype and phenotype. Table 2 shows the
interval time required for diagnosis. Of 97 valid responses, 72 cases
(74.2%) were diagnosed within a month from onset, 19 cases (19.6%)
from 1 month to 1 year and 6 cases (6.2%) took over a year. These last
six cases included two of vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA (one
patient died at 12 years of age) and one each of vitamin B12-
responsive MMA, PA, glutaric aciduria type I and ethylmalonic
aciduria.
Clinical characteristics and manifestations
In MMA and PA, clinical and laboratory findings noted through the
patients’ clinical course are shown in Table 3a. Most patients had a
history of vomiting and appetite loss. In contrast, hypoglycemia and
seizure were observed in fewer than 30% of all cases. Liver dysfunc￾tion were found in many cases of vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA
(23/42, 54.8%, Po0.05), but fatty liver and hepatomegaly were not
statistically significant in this group (17/42, 40.5% for each).
Furthermore, renal dysfunction was more likely to occur in MMA,
regardless of the response to vitamin B12, than in PA (Po0.05).
Mental retardation is a characteristic clinical feature in OAs.
Patients with vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA were significantly
more likely to experience mental retardation compared with those
with vitamin B12-responsive MMA and PA (Po0.05). Factors
associated with mental retardation are shown in Table 3a. In patients
with vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA, factors associated with mental
retardation were seizure (Po0.05), liver dysfunction (Po0.01), fatty
liver (Po0.01) and hepatomegaly (Po0.01). In patients with vitamin
B12-responsive MMA, associated factors were failure to thrive
(Po0.05) and seizure (Po0.05). In patients with PA, associated
factors were failure to thrive (Po0.05). In addition, liver dysfunction,
fatty liver, hepatomegaly and failure to thrive as associated factors
were significant indicators regardless of suffering from seizure. Factors
associated with mortality are shown in Table 3a. Failure to thrive
(Po0.05), pancreatitis (Po0.05) and hypoglycemia (Po0.01) were
significantly associated with deceased patients of MMA. The median
age of the 10 deceased patients of MMA with failure to thrive was 55
months (IQR, 17–83; range, 2 months to 276 months). Failure to
thrive, pancreatitis and hypoglycemia as associated factor with
mortality were not significantly related to the maximum value of
blood ammonium and blood pH value at onset and seizure,
respectively (P40.05). The maximum values of blood ammonium
at onset are shown in Figure 1a. The median blood ammonium values
of vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA (n ¼ 18), vitamin B12-responsive
MMA (n ¼ 8) and PA (n ¼ 10) patients were 115 mmol l 1 (IQR, 76–
343), 103 mmol l1 (IQR, 74–169) and 120 mmol l1 (IQR, 72354),
respectively. There was no significant difference in the blood
ammonium values between the groups. In cases of mortality and
mental retardation, there was no significant difference in the max￾imum values of blood ammonium at onset among those with MMA.
The blood pH values at onset are shown in Figure 1b. Within the
limit of valid data, the median blood pH values of vitamin B12-
unresponsive MMA (n ¼ 18), vitamin B12-responsive MMA (n ¼ 7)
and PA (n ¼ 9) patients were 7.15 (IQR, 7.03–7.20), 7.31 (IQR, 7.22–
7.36) and 7.23 (IQR, 7.11–7.37), respectively. Patients with vitamin
B12-unresponsive MMA were more likely to have a lower blood pH,
without a statistically significant difference, compared with vitamin
B12-responsive MMA or PA, but with a statistically significant
difference, compared with both vitamin B12-responsive MMA and
PA (Po0.05). In cases of mortality and mental retardation, there was
no significant change in blood pH values at the onset of MMA. In
addition, there was no significance in outcomes between mental
retardation and blood pH values at onset.
Treatment and outcome
We investigated the required intensive care treatments, such as
hemodialysis, exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis, respirator
use and catecholamine administration, during the acute phase. In
total, 40.0% (12/30), 13.3% (2/15) and 23.8% (5/21) of patients with
vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA, vitamin B12-responsive MMA and
PA, respectively, required intensive care treatments. Vitamin B12-

unresponsive MMA patients were significantly more likely to undergo
intensive care treatment (Po0.05). In these patients, hemodialysis
was performed in 16.7% (5/30), exchange transfusion in 16.7% (5/
30), peritoneal dialysis in 20.0% (6/30), respirator use in 20.0% (6/30)
and catecholamine administration in 17.2% (5/30) of cases. Among
all the OAs, deceased patients required hemodialysis, exchange
transfusion or peritoneal dialysis significantly (Po0.05).
Table 3b shows the management for the chronic phase, including
the administration of medications and a low-protein diet. L-Carnitine
was prescribed for almost all patients (94.9%) of MMA and PA.
Arginine and sodium benzoate was seldom prescribed for MMA and
PA patients (0%, 2.5% for MMA and 5.3%, 5.3% for PA, respec￾tively). Vitamin B12-responsive MMA patients were treated with
vitamin B12, except for one patient who underwent liver transplanta￾tion. Metronidazole and a combination of sodium bi￾carbonate and citrate were more often prescribed to vitamin B12-
unresponsive MMA patients at rates of 40% and 56%, respectively,
compared with vitamin B12-responsive MMA and PA. With regard to
nutrition management, we assessed the administration of a restricted
protein diet at 2 weeks after onset and during the chronic phase
(Table 3b). Vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA patients were given a
strictly restricted protein diet, in comparison with vitamin B12-
responsive MMA and PA patients. During the chronic phase, feeding
support, such as a naso-gastric tube and gastrostomy tube, was
required in 40.0% of vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA, 20.0% of
vitamin B12-responsive MMA and 23.5% of PA patients. The survival
rate was compared between MMA and PA using the Kaplan-Meier
curves (Figure 2). There was valid data for the outcomes of 31
vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA, 16 vitamin B12-responsive MMA
and 24 PA patients. Ten vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA patients
died due to severe acidosis (n ¼ 3), cardiomyopathy (n ¼ 1) and
unknown causes (n ¼ 6). Of the 65 MMA patients with valid data
regarding liver transplantation, 13 received liver transplantation (11
vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA patients and 2 vitamin B12-respon￾sive MMA patients). In addition, six PA patients underwent liver
transplantation. As the number of liver transplantation cases was
limited in this study, the survival rate was estimated in non￾transplanted cases. The survival rate of vitamin B12-unresponsive
MMA was significantly lower than those of vitamin B12-responsive
MMA and PA. In vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA patients, the
survival rate gradually decreased to 69.8% by the age of 144 months,
following which the survival rate was steady until 276 months.
Moreover, the survival rate at 10 years of age in the early-onset type
and the late-onset type of vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA were
61.0% and 81.0%, respectively, which was no significant difference
between the types. In contrast, the survival rates at 20 years of age in
vitamin B12-responsive MMA and PA patients were 94.4% and
95.8%, respectively.
DISCUSSION
OAs are often life-threatening immediately after disease onset and can
result in severe sequelae.1 These rare diseases require further
investigation to improve the current management and outcomes of
OAs. This study revealed the clinical features of OAs in Japan,
especially in cases with MMA and PA. We found that the majority of
patients with OAs had MMA, followed by PA, together accounting for
B80% of all OAs in Japan.

There are several limitations to this study. First, most patient
information available was restricted to neonates, infants and children.
Second, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was not used as a
general screening tool in all OAs. Since the early 1990s, MS/MS has
been considered an effective tool for diagnosing inborn errors of
metabolism.4,10,11 In Japan, a pilot study examining the use of MS/MS
was started in 1997; however, MS/MS is just becoming a part of
government screening in recent years. In the present study, 15 cases of
OAs were diagnosed by NBS using MS/MS or advanced metabolic
tests before onset. Seven possible mild PA patients could be involved
in this study. Third, there may have been some bias as most patients
with OAs were managed by specialists in inherited metabolic diseases,
and therefore might have good outcomes. It is possible that there were
some patients who received limited treatment and/or management
and others who were not diagnosed; however, in Japan, patients with
OAs are typically referred to specialists in inherited metabolic diseases.
Blood glucose as an important indicator of a poor prognosis
in MMA and PA
Previous studies report that the majority of MMA and PA patients
were diagnosed in the neonatal period.12–15 In the present study, the
majority of MMA and PA patients had an early onset, and almost all
of the remaining patients manifested clinical signs within the first year
of life. OAs are characterized by common symptoms, possibly leading
to decompensation.1,15 The present study indicated a significant
relationship between hypoglycemia and mortality in vitamin B12-
unresponsive MMA patients. Hypoglycemia was not a common
feature of MMA and PA, but it was a significant prognostic
factor of mortality in vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA patients.
Hypoglycemia might be induced by graduated severity of
decompensation because it was the results of decompensation
regarding glucose metabolism. Furthermore, hyperglycemia in
MMA patients was also indicative of a poor prognosis.16,17 Thus,
for careful monitoring of MMA and PA, blood glucose is an
important marker.17
Difference in the management of patients with MMA and PA
Aggressive, broad therapy is often necessary to treat OAs at onset
because of the possibility of severe sequelae and death. Affected
individuals should be referred to a metabolic center where intensive
care is available.18–20 In the present study, the frequency of intensive
care treatment was greater in MMA patients than in PA patients.
Hemodialysis, exchange transfusion or peritoneal dialysis were used
significantly in all mortality cases. Furthermore, in the present study,
L-carnitine was prescribed for almost all affected individuals, which is
similar to the recommended treatment.14,19,21 The importance of
preventing secondary carnitine deficiency is relatively well understood
in the management of OAs. Moreover, it is important to intake
adequate amount of protein while managing nutrition.22 When
affected patients are in a state of decompensation, a strict restrictive
protein diet is necessary for recovery. However, after recovery from
the decompensation, infants and children require sufficient protein
for growth. In the present study, many vitamin B12-unresponsive
MMA patients were given a restricted protein diet, and 70% of them
were found to have failure to thrive, which is likely a result of the
limited diet.
Clinical features associated with mental retardation and mortality
in MMA and PA
Failure to thrive was associated with mortality in patients with MMA.
Because the 10 deceased patients of MMA with failure to thrive
involved three infants under the 12 months of age, failure to thrive
was important factor to management for not only after infant period
but also during infant period. Furthermore, failure to thrive as
associated factor with mortality was not related to blood ammonium
value and pH value at onset, and seizure. Vitamin B12-responsive
MMA and PA patients received a restricted protein diet less frequently
than vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA. However, failure to thrive was
significantly related to mental retardation in vitamin B12-responsive
MMA and PA patients. In MMA patients, seizures were associated
with mental retardation regardless of the response to vitamin B12,
similarly to a previous report.23 Moreover, liver dysfunction,
hepatomegaly and fatty liver were related to mental retardation in
vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA patients, but not to mortality. In
addition, these associated factors to mental retardation were
indicators regardless of suffering from seizure. In this study, because
of limited valid data, influence of the blood ammonium value and pH
value at onset on the clinical feature as associated factors to mental
retardation was unclear. In PA patients, vomiting and appetite loss
were related to mental retardation significantly. However, those were
common and nonspecific symptoms in metabolic disease.
The majority of deaths occurred in vitamin B12-unresponsive
MMA patients. Therefore, there was significant difference in mortality
rates between vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA, vitamin B12-respon￾sive MMA and PA patients. Concerning treatment of OAs, more
MMA patients required intensive care treatment compared with PA
patients, especially hemodialysis, exchange transfusion or peritoneal
dialysis were used significantly in all mortality cases. There was no
significance found in blood ammonium values at the onset in MMA
and PA patients. In comparison, progressive acidosis was observed in
vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA patients, who had significantly lower
blood pH compared with patients with vitamin B12-responsive MMA
and PA (Po0.05). This was likely due to the effects of toxic
metabolites such as methylmalonate on secondary mitochondrial
dysfunction, as previously reported.15,24
Outcome
We analyzed the outcomes of MMA and PA patients using Kaplan￾Maier curves (Figure 2). Because of improving therapies including
nutrition management, drugs and hemodialysis, the survival rates
of MMA and PA patients have increased in comparison with
previous reports. In the present study, there was a significant
difference in mortality among vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA,
vitamin B12-responsive MMA and PA patients. The survival rate in
vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA patients gradually decreased to
69.8% by the age of 144 months. In contrast, that in PA patients at
20 years of the age was 95.8%. MMA was much severe than PA,
but clinically classical PA was more severe than or at least as severe
as vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA. In this study, though the
survival rate in PA patients was better than that of vitamin
B12-unresponsive MMA, PA patients could involve seven possible
mild PA patients. Those possible mild form PA patients might
have the mild form specific mutation (Y435C) in the PCC gene
and might not develop acute decompensation.25 Because of
including mild PA patients in analysis, the survival rate of PA
might be higher than that excluding mild PA patients. In the future,
as the use of NBS with MS/MS increases, it is our hope that the
mortality rates of MMA and PA patients will continue to decrease
as previously described.5 Furthermore, factors associated with
mental retardation and death may affect the indications for liver
transplantation.

CONCLUSION
Patients with vitamin B12-unresponsive MMA were more likely to
develop severe manifestations and complications than those with
vitamin B12-responsive MMA and PA. Failure to thrive, hypogly￾cemia and pancreatitis associated with mortality are amenable factors
to appropriate management, especially in cases with vitamin B12-
unresponsive MMA. The survival rates at 20 years of age in vitamin
B12-unresponsive MMA, vitamin B12-responsive MMA and PA
patients were 69.8%, 94.4% and 95.8%, respectively.
