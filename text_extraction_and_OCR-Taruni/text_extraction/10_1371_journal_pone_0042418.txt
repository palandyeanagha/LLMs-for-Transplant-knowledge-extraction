Abstract
Objective: Identification of drug-induced liver disease (DILI) is difficult, even among hospitalized patients. The aim of this
pilot study was to assess the impact of a specific strategy for DILI screening.
Design: We prospectively compared the number of acute DILI cases identified in one week of a proactive strategy based on
centralized elevated ALT values to those identified with a standard of care strategy for 24-week period based on referral
cases to the hepatology unit. In the centralized strategy, a designated study biochemist identified patients with ALT greater
than 3 times the upper limit of normal values (ULN) and notified the designated hepatologists, who then went to the
patients’ wards, analyzed the charts, and if necessary, interviewed the identified patients. During these two periods, patients
with possible DILI were included after signing an informed consent in an ongoing European diagnostic study (SAFE-T
consortium).
Results: During the 24-week period of the standard strategy, 12 (0.04%) patients out of a total of 28,145 were identified as
having possible DILI, and 11 of these accepted to be included in the protocol. During the one-week proactive period, 7
patients out of a total of 1407 inpatients (0.498%) [odds ratio vs. standard = 12.1 (95% CI, 3.9–32.3); P,0.0001] were
identified with possible DILI, and 5 were included in the protocol.
Conclusion: A simple strategy based on the daily analysis of cases with ALT .3 ULN by designated biochemists and
hepatologists identified 12 times more acute cases of drug-induced liver disease than the standard strategy. This pilot
cohort is registered on the number AP-HP P110201/1/08-03-2011 and AFSSAPS B110346-70.

Introduction
Adverse drug events occur as a consequence of medication
errors or adverse drug reactions (ADR). ADRs rate among the
leading causes of death in the Western world [1–2]. Systematic
reviews have shown that 5–10% of all inpatients are expected to
experience severe ADRs, which have contributed to the deaths of
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e42418

0.3–0.5% of all admitted patients [1–2]. However, 30–40% of
those ADR are considered to have been preventable.
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to paracetamol overdose
and idiosyncratic drug reactions is the leading cause of acute liver
failure and may contribute to as many as 0.3% of all inpatient
deaths [3–5].
Approximately 1 in 100 patients develops DILI during
hospitalization, but more than 50% of cases have been missed
when they occurred in non-hepatology departments [4]. Therefore
better methods of DILI detection in hospitals are needed.
The Safer and Faster Evidence-based Translation (SAFE-T)
consortium is a public–private partnership comprising 20 partners
from the pharmaceutical industry, small–medium enterprises,
academic institutions and clinical units of excellence, with
representatives from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as
external observers and advisors. It operates under the framework
of the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI￾JU) (http://www.imi.europa.eu) [5–8].
As a part of the protocols initiated by SAFE-T, we aimed to
improve the detection of DILI in hospitals by organizing a
centralized alert algorithm. This strategy was based on the
standard ‘‘Temple’s criteria’’, which is the occurrence of an
elevated alanine aminotransferase serum level (ALT) greater than
3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the presence of a drug
and in the absence of other causes [9–11].
We report here on the results of a pilot study describing the
proof of concept of a proactive strategy based on a daily
centralized analysis of elevated ALT (centralized strategy) com￾Figure 1. Flowchart of the identification of DILI during the
centralized period in 1995 patients with ALT measurement.

pared to the usual ‘‘passive’’ strategy based on cases referred to the
hepatology unit (standard strategy). The centralized strategy
identified 12 times more patients with DILI than the standard
strategy.
Patients and Methods
This study was part of the ongoing protocol (Protocol 3 of the
Work Package 3) of the SAFE-T consortium, which was in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the
Pitie´ Salpeˆtrie`re Hospital Ethics Committee. All included patients
signed an informed consent. The protocol for this cohort and
supporting STROBE checklist are available as supporting
information; see Protocol S1 and Checklist S1.
The SAFE-T consortium proposes a generic qualification
strategy for translational safety biomarkers (TSBM), outlining
proposals on how to generate sufficient preclinical and clinical
evidence to qualify new TSBM for regulatory decision-making in
defined contexts. The experience gained during the course of the
SAFE-T project for three organ toxicities will be integrated into
improvements for this initial generic approach [5–8].
Centralized strategy
The ‘‘SAFE-T group’’ of the study included 8 participants. All
ALT assay results performed in the two laboratories of the hospital
were centralized each day by a senior biochemist (HMK) and a
technician (NR). The results of all elevated ALT samples greater
than 36ULN (ALT.3ULN) were sent by intranet to 6
experienced hepatologists (HP, YN, MM, MR, JM, and TP). In
the 48 hours following the ALT results, one of the hepatologists
went to the inpatient wards and analyzed the chart. According to
the patient’s chart, each case with ALT.3ULN was classified as:
hepato-biliary disease (such as viral hepatitis C or cholelithiasis),
cardiovascular origin (such as septic shock or cardiac arrest),
muscle disease (such as contusion, myopathy), other causes, or
possible DILI according to the SAFE-T protocol definition [6–8].
The criteria for inclusion as acute DILI in the SAFE-T protocol
were the following: consecutive patients with suspected acute
DILI, defined as ALT.3ULN, and with baseline results before
drug treatment, if available, below the ULN; history of drug intake
including acetaminophen, multiple drugs, recreational drugs
(cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines), and herbs; a minimum 2-fold
increase from the baseline level if the baseline ALT level, if
available, was greater than ULN; absence of other known causes
of liver injury; and patients aged .18 years who were capable of
and willing to provide written informed consent. The exclusion
criteria were the following: hepatitis E, hepatitis C, autoimmune
liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis, extrahepatic cholestasis, ischemic liver damage and the
presence of liver metastasis or other malignant diseases. If the
patient met the inclusion criteria, and the medical team agreed,
the hepatologist interviewed the patient, explained the protocol
and included the patient in the SAFE-T protocol after the consent
was signed.
Patients with DILI had liver injury classification based on the
first laboratory determination according to the CIOMS (Council
for International Organizations of Medical Science) criteria [12].
Standard strategy
The standard strategy was the routine followed in the hospital.
The suspected DILI cases were presented by the non-hepatologist
physician to a senior full-time hepatologist; these were then
considered for inclusion in the SAFE-T protocol if they met the
inclusion criteria, as with the centralized strategy.
Biochemical analysis
Biochemical assays were performed with fresh plasma that had
been decanted and stored for a maximum of 72 hours at +2 to 8uC
under no-light conditions. ALT-activity measurement used the
reference method defined by the International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) with
pyridoxal phosphate and was calibrated [11]. Total bilirubin was
assayed by the diazo reaction method.
The ALT ULN was based on a study of 2,200 apparently
healthy blood donors whowere negative for human immunodefi￾ciency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus markers. The
study included 1,171 men and 880 women. The thresholds were
26 IU/L in women and 35 IU/L in men. They were determined
by the mean +1 SD after exclusion of the 5% extreme values
[7,11].
Statistical analysis
The main endpoint was the prevalence of possible acute cases of
DILI identified during the period. The a priori hypothesis was that
a centralized strategy would result in a minimum 6-fold increase in
the prevalence of identified DILI cases, i.e. from one DILI every
two weeks, which was the standard incidence we observed, to three
DILI every week. The prevalences were compared using odds

Results
Centralized period
During the one-week pro-active period, from November 26 to
December 2 2011, 1,995 patients had ALT measurements
(Figure 1), including 1,407 inpatients and 588 outpatients. The
characteristics of patients with and without elevated ALT during
the centralized period are described in Table 1. A total of 128
patients had ALT .3ULN. Most cases of elevated ALT were
identified in patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care,
hepatology and neurology units.
The characteristics of patients with and without DILI are given
in Table 2. Seven DILI cases were identified; these occurred only
among inpatients, with a prevalence of 6.7% (7/104). These
patients were hospitalized in the intensive care, neurology,
hepatology, infectious disease and psychiatric units. Five of the
seven patients accepted inclusion in the SAFE-T protocol.
Standard period
During the 24-week period of the standard strategy (June 1-
November 25, 2011), 12 patients out of a total of 36,077 inpatients
were identified with possible DILI, i.e. a prevalence of 0.033%; 11
of these accepted inclusion in the SAFE-T protocol.
Main endpoint
During the one-week centralized period, the prevalence of DILI
was 0.498% among inpatients, (7 patients out of a total of 1,407
inpatients) which was significantly higher than the prevalence
observed during the standard period, 0.043% (12/28,145 inpa￾tients), with an odds ratio vs. standard of 12.1 (95% CI, 3.9–32.3;
P,0.0001).
Comparison between the two periods
The two periods had the following similar characteristics
(Table 3, Table 4 and Table S1): number of inpatients and
outpatients per week, the percentage of patients who underwent
ALT assays, and the percentage of patients with ALT .3ULN. All
patients period had ALT elevation after history of drug intake. In
the group of patients who had multiple suspected drugs, 87% (13/
15) started all the medications at the same time. The individual
characteristics of DILI patients identified during the centralized
period were less severe than those identified during the standard
period, with significantly lower ALT (median 221 vs. 1,498 IU/L,
P,0.001); though statistically non-significant, there were also
fewer patients with jaundice (Hy’s rule criteria: 1 vs. 5; P = 0.20)
and no deaths or transplantations (0 vs. 4; P = 0.30) (Table 4).
Three (16%) patients had DILI within less than 5 days from
drug intake: chemotherapy before a bone marrow transplantation
in centralized period; an overdose of acetaminophen due to
abdominal pain and a suicidal case, in the standard period. In

addition, 11 (58%) patients had history of drug intake more than 5
and less than 90 days.
The proportion of patients with full liver analyses, including
hepatitis viral markers, auto- antibodies, and abdominal imaging
was 12 out of 12 during the standard period, and 6 out of 7 during
the centralized period.
After the suspicion of DILI, all patients had abdominal imaging
(ultrasound or computerized tomography) to eliminate other
causes of ALT increase DILI. Despite many of them have had
malign diseases none of them had suspected liver images, such as
nodules or liver mass.
Discussion
There have been no studies to date that have prospectively
compared a real-time strategy to a standard strategy for DILI
screening in hospitals. Most studies have been retrospective and
used hospital codes [4,12–14]. The aim of this pilot study was to
estimate the increase in DILI screening in a tertiary hospital using
a proactive strategy compared with the passive standard strategy.
The results of the proactive strategy were surprising: the assumed
hypothesis was that the prevalence of identification would increase
6-fold, and we actually observed a 12-fold increase of DILI cases
compared with the standard strategy.
The results observed during the standard period had not been
underestimated. The prevalence of DILI in 6 months was 12 cases
out of 30,023 total hospital admissions (0.04%) and 3.75% (12/
3200) of the gastroenterology ward admissions, which were similar
to those assessed retrospectively by Carey et al. (0.048% of all
83,265 hospital admissions) [13], and by Devarbhavi et al. (1.43%
of 14,909 of gastroenterology ward admissions) [14]. Bargheri et
al. used a computerized process based on laboratory data (ALT
over 2 ULN) and noted a similar DILI rate of 6.6% in hospitalized
patients [15] The authors did not perform a real-time strategy, as
most of the patients were no longer hospitalized when the charts
were analyzed, contrary to our strategy, in which the cases were
identified in less than 48 hours.
The results from the centralized period suggest underreporting
of DILI during the standard period, at least in non-hepatology
wards. This was already demonstrated by Meier et al., who
retrospectively observed 57 DILI cases out of 4,209 inpatients with
normal baseline ALT, i.e. DILI incidence of 1.4%. Liver injuries
were not mentioned in the diagnoses or in the physicians’
discharge letters in about 52–68% of all cases [4].
Cases identified during the standard period were more severe
than during the pro-active period, with significantly higher ALT
levels, more patients who met the Hy’s criteria (the conventional
signal of severe DILI), and more patients who died or were
transplanted. This was not a bias and was expected, since the
physicians in the non-hepatology ward probably did not call the
hepatologist for each case of ALT .3ULN in the absence of
jaundice. These results therefore strongly suggest that the
centralized method could prevent very severe complications. For
instance an increase in ALT just over 3ULN in a chemotherapy
patient could lead to an investigation for hepatitis B infection and
to an immediate and effective treatment. This was not the case for
such a patient during the standard period, who was identified only
after the onset of jaundice and was treated too late and finally died
from hepatic failure.
The present study had limitations due to the short period of
evaluation and the commitment of eight persons. The costs and
the efficiency of the centralized strategy should be confirmed over
a longer period and in different hospitals to prove that the study
results are generalizable (external validity). We have not evaluated
a more specific strategy such as the identification of patients who
have increased ALT results on two consecutive occasions. Another
limitation is the possibility that treating physicians might have
recognized the DILI event and thus stopped the medication or lab
tests improved with time (adaption) thereby not requiring a
Hepatology consult - thus over emphasizing our findings. However
this bias would reduce the overall detection of DILI but not the
detection of severe DILI.
There is obviously an economic interest for developing such
algorithms due to the costs of ADRs in Western countries. The
ADR costs in one hospital per bed and per year have been
estimated to be approximately J6000 in the USA [16], France
[17], and England [18]. To reduce the resources needed and
particularly the physician costs, the present algorithm could be
improved by using centralized hospital databases or drug event
indicators [19–20]. Susceptibility to DILI is influenced by the
interactions of many factors, including age, gender, concurrent
drugs, co-morbidity and genetics. To date, no combination of
factors has been able to identify very high or very low risk DILI
profiles [3].
This pilot study focused on necrosis and did not detect
cholestatic injury or micro/macrovesicular steatosis; the design
was also not able to identify late-onset drug reactions (e.g.
warfarin).
The standard of ALT .3ULN is an arbitrary guideline with low
accuracy for identification of DILI [3]. Therefore it was not
surprising that when the ALT guideline is used to collect possible
cases, followed by clinician evaluation of the case in real-time, the
accuracy of the .3ULN selection methodology then mimics the
RUCAM approach or Hy’s Law. We acknowledge that this
strategy will only be improved with the development of more
accurate DILI biomarkers (i.e. proteomics or drug-protein adduct
assays), which is the aim of the SAFE-T consortium.
The implicit assumption in this study was that this real-time
strategy would be more helpful than harmful to inpatients, since
the offending drug would be discontinued. We recognize that it is
difficult to be certain whether stopping the short-term use of life￾saving medicines used in hospitals due to a possible DILI will do
more good than harm [21].
On the other hand the present study shows that more DILI can
be identified in real-time than in the standard ‘‘wait and see’’
manner. The subsequent challenge then is assessing the benefit￾risk of stopping the drug. Among our identified DILI, we
acknowledge that the benefit-risk of stopping amiodarone is
controversial [22], but the early discovery of acute hepatitis B
reactivation or olanzapine acute toxicity were probably useful for
these patients.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a simple strategy based on the daily analysis of
cases identified by ALT greater than 3ULN by designated study
biochemists and hepatologists identified 12 times more acute drug￾induced liver disease than the standard strategy.
