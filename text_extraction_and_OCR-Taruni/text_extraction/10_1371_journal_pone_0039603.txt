Abstract
Background: Liver biopsy is the reference standard for assessing liver fibrosis and no reliable non-invasive diagnostic
approach is available to discriminate between the intermediate stages of fibrosis. Therefore suitable serological biomarkers
of liver fibrosis are urgently needed. We used proteomics to identify novel fibrosis biomarkers in hepatitis C patients with
different degrees of liver fibrosis.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Proteins in plasma samples from healthy control individuals and patients with hepatitis C
virus (HCV) induced cirrhosis were analysed using a proteomics technique: two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). This
technique separated the proteins in plasma samples of control and cirrhotic patients and by visualizing the separated
proteins we were able to identify proteins which were increasing or decreasing in hepatic cirrhosis. Identified markers were
validated across all Ishak fibrosis stages and compared to the markers used in FibroTest, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test,
Hepascore and FIBROSpect by Western blotting. Forty four candidate biomarkers for hepatic fibrosis were identified of
which 20 were novel biomarkers of liver fibrosis. Western blot validation of all candidate markers using plasma samples from
patients across all Ishak fibrosis scores showed that the markers which changed with increasing fibrosis most consistently
included lipid transfer inhibitor protein, complement C3d, corticosteroid-binding globulin, apolipoprotein J and
apolipoprotein L1. These five novel fibrosis markers which are secreted in blood showed a promising consistent change
with increasing fibrosis stage when compared to the markers used for the FibroTest, ELF test, Hepascore and FIBROSpect.
These markers will be further validated using a large clinical cohort.
Conclusions/Significance: This study identifies 20 novel fibrosis biomarker candidates. The proteins identified may help to
assess hepatic fibrosis and eliminate the need for invasive liver biopsies.

Introduction
More than 170 million individuals, approximately 3% of the
world’s population, are currently infected with the hepatitis C
virus (HCV) [1]. Infection with HCV is one of the leading causes
of liver fibrosis which, if left untreated, can develop into cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current reference standard for
assessing hepatic fibrosis is liver biopsy followed by histological
analysis [2]. This procedure is invasive, expensive and up to 40%
of patients experience severe pain. Coupled with this, if hepatic
fibrosis is not homogenous the rate of false negatives from liver
biopsy can be as high as 20%, with sampling error observed when
biopsies under 10 mm are analysed [2,3].
Various non-invasive approaches have been proposed for
assessing hepatic fibrosis including protein, glycoprotein and
glycan biomarkers [2]. The FibroTest, a test based on five serum
markers – apolipoprotein A1, haptoglobin, gamma glutamyltran￾speptidase, alpha 2 macroglobulin and bilirubin, has been
described to reduce the number of biopsies for managing HCV
infection [4], but it eliminates the need for biopsy in only 26% of
patients [5]. A more recent development, the Enhanced Liver
Fibrosis (ELF) test, uses tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1
(TIMP-1), hyaluronic acid and procollagen III amino terminal
peptide (PIIIP) [6,7]. PIIIP has low diagnostic value in assessing
fibrosis [8] and both PIIIP and hyaluronic acid increase in patients
with viral hepatitis after interferon alpha treatment [9]. Hepascore
[10] (which uses bilirubin, gamma glutamyltranspeptidase,
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39603

hyaluronic acid, alpha 2 macroglobulin) and FIBROSpect [11]
(which uses hyaluronic acid, TIMP-1, and alpha 2 macroglobulin)
are other fibrosis tests which use the same markers among
FibroTest and ELF test. Although all these established tests are
often able to discriminate between absence of fibrosis and
advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, serum markers have difficulties in
classifying the intermediate stages between these two extremes
often referred to as a ‘gray area’ [12]. In view of this, there remains
a need for more reliable non-invasive markers to decrease the need
for liver biopsy.
Previously we and others have used 2-DE over a wide pH 3–10
range to successfully identify several novel candidate biomarkers
for liver fibrosis [13,14]. In our previous proteomics study we show
that all proteins which increased or decreased in expression in
early or moderate fibrosis (Ishak stages 1–3) also change in
cirrhosis, but not all proteins which increased or decreased in
cirrhosis also change in the earlier fibrosis stages [13]. In this study
we compare plasma samples from healthy control individuals with
samples from patients with cirrhosis using a narrower pH range,
and then test whether any of the proteins with significantly
changed expression levels also show a consistent and quantifiable
change in the intermediate ‘gray area’, which we analysed by
Western blotting using plasma samples across all Ishak fibrosis
scores. We have recently shown that 2-DE with a narrow pH 3–
5.6 range is a novel approach which is beneficial for biomarker
discovery [15,16]. In the current study, we have increased our
panel of candidate biomarkers for hepatic fibrosis by using this
novel approach to compare plasma samples from healthy control
individuals with samples from patients with cirrhosis. The pH 3–
5.6 range was chosen since this lies outside the range of highly
abundant albumin, transferrin and immunoglobulins. This enables
more protein to be loaded than in our previous fibrosis marker
study and enhances representation of low abundance proteins.
A selection of markers identified reliably changed in expression
across all Ishak fibrosis scores when analysed using Western
blotting and are novel candidates for non-invasive fibrosis markers.
These markers appear to be very promising when compared to the
markers in FibroTest, ELF test, Hepascore and FIBROSpect.
Materials and Methods
Patient Samples
Plasma samples were collected in P100 tubes (BD, Oxford, UK)
from 50 subjects: 45 HCV-infected patients with varying degrees
of hepatic fibrosis and 5 healthy control individuals. The patients
were all recruited from outpatients attending for routine follow up
visits at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. The Ishak
scores of all 45 patients were determined as previously described
[17] and these scores along with other clinical details are displayed
in Table S1. Collection of all plasma samples for this study was
carried out by obtaining both verbal and written informed consent
from each individual and this was approved by the Central Oxford
Research Ethics Committee (No. 98.137). Unlike our previous
study in which we used serum [13], for the current study we used
plasma to discover novel fibrosis biomarkers, using recently
developed P100 tubes. Unlike any other blood collection tube,
this tube contains proprietary protein stabilizers that solubilize
immediately as blood is collected and thus enhances preservation
and recovery of proteins making them ideal for proteome analysis
and biomarker discovery [18]. These samples were used for two
studies: Firstly, plasma from healthy control individuals and
patients with cirrhosis were compared by proteomics using 2-DE
to identify candidate fibrosis biomarkers. Secondly, these candi￾date markers were validated by Western blotting using plasma
samples from patients across all seven Ishak scores. All the blood
samples used for both 2-DE and Western blotting were acquired
within 12 months of liver biopsy except for three cirrhotic patients
who had biopsies more than 12 months before sampling but were
clinically cirrhotic and therefore biopsies within 12 months were
not required (see Table S1).
Proteomics using 2-DE with pH 3–5.6 Strips
Plasma samples from five different healthy control individuals
and five different HCV-infected patients with hepatic cirrhosis
(with an Ishak score [17] of 6) were initially selected for 2-DE
analysis (Table 1). Samples were run by 2-DE using the approach
we recently described [15,16]. Two mg of the plasma samples
were made up to 375 ml in isoelectric focusing (IEF) rehydration
buffer (5 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2 mM tributyl phosphine, 65 mM
DTT, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 150 mM non-detergent sulfobetaine 256
(NDSB-256) and 0.0012% (w/v) bromophenol blue) with 1.8% (v/
v) pH 3–6 ampholytes (SERVALYTH, SERVA, Heidelberg,
Germany). Samples were left overnight to rehydrate 18 cm
pH 3–5.6 DryStrips (GE Healthcare, Bucks, UK). Isoelectric
focusing was carried out for 75 kVh at 17uC. Strips were
incubated in equilibration solution (4 M urea, 2 M thiourea,
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS,
130 mM DTT, 0.002% (w/v) bromophenol blue) for 15 min.
Proteins were separated by 9–16% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gradient gels
using 20 mA per gel for 1 h, followed by 40 mA per gel for 4 h at
10uC. Following electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 40% (v/v)
ethanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid and stained with the fluorescent
dye OGT 1238 [19]. Gels were scanned using an Apollo II linear
fluorescence scanner (Oxford Glycosciences, Abingdon, UK) to
obtain 16-bit images at 200 mm resolution.
Differential Image Analysis
Scanned gel images were processed with a custom version of
the Melanie II software (Oxford Glycosciences, Abingdon, UK)
[19]. For image analysis, five gels of plasma from different
healthy control individuals were compared with five gels of
plasma from different HCV-infected patients with hepatic
cirrhosis. A synthetic image was created using accurate spot
matching which showed all protein spots (features) in the gels
for control and cirrhotic plasma. The optical density of each
feature was determined by summing pixels within the feature
boundary and the volume was determined by integrating this
optical density over the area of the feature. All statistical
calculations were based on the percentage volume of the
features and changes in protein expression were determined as
a ratio of the mean percentages of feature volumes. Since some
low abundant features may be undetected by the algorithm of
the software, features present in at least three of five individual
gels belonging to either the control or cirrhotic group of gels
were considered for statistical analysis and all gels were later
visualised in a montage format to confirm if the features were
present in all five gels. Features which changed in expression by
at least 2-fold in percentage spot volume were considered as
differentially expressed and were statistically validated using
a rank-sum test on percentage spot volumes with P # 0.05
(95% confidence) as previously described [19,20]. All changes in
expression were further validated by visualizing the differentially
expressed features across all gels in a montage format and these
features were excised from the gels for mass spectrometric
analysis. All gels were calibrated using landmarks of known pH
and molecular weight so that the pH and molecular weights of
the differentially expressed features could be determined.

In-gel Digestion and Peptide Extraction
Differentially expressed features assigned for mass spectrometric
analysis were excised from gels using a software-driven robotic
cutter (Oxford Glycosciences, Abingdon, UK). Recovered gel
pieces were dried in a SpeedVac followed by in-gel trypsin
digestion and peptide extraction using the automated DigestPro
workstation (Intavis, Cologne, Germany) as we recently described
[16]. Digested samples were lyophilised and dissolved in 0.1% (v/
v) formic acid prior to mass spectrometric analysis.
Mass Spectrometric Analysis
Tryptic peptides were analysed using a Q-TOF 1 mass
spectrometer coupled to a CapLC (Waters, Hertfordshire, UK).
Peptides were concentrated and desalted on a 300 mm I.D./5 mm
C18 precolumn and resolved on a 75 mm I.D./25 cm C18
PepMap analytical column (LC packings, CA, USA) with a 45 min
5–95% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) formic
acid at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Spectra were acquired in
positive mode. MS to MS/MS switching was controlled in an
automatic data-dependent fashion with a 1 s survey scan followed
by three 1 s MS/MS scans. Ions selected for MS/MS were
excluded from further fragmentation for 2 min. Raw MS/MS
spectra were smoothed and centred using ProteinLynx Global
server 2.1.5, spectra were not deisotoped. Processed peak list (.pkl)
files were searched against the SWISS-PROT database (release
56.9) using MASCOT Daemon 2.1.0 (Matrix Science, London,
UK). Searches were restricted to human taxonomy (20402
sequences). Carbamidomethyl cysteine was defined as a fixed
modification and oxidized methionine as a variable modification.
Data were searched allowing 0.5 Da error to accommodate
calibration drift and up to 2 missed tryptic cleavage sites. A
minimum ion score cut-off of 28 was applied with confident
protein assignment requiring a minimum of 2 unique peptides.
The MSMS of all single peptide IDs were manually validated and
required a minimum of 6 y-ions (or b-ions for C-terminal
peptides.) MSMS spectra quality was judged by s/n, fragment
ion isotopes and fragmentation markers such as proline residues.
Biomarker Validation
Western blotting was used to validate the novel fibrosis markers
identified and were compared to protein markers in FibroTest,
ELF test, Hepascore and FIBROSpect also using Western
blotting. Four different plasma samples from controls (Ishak score
0) and two different plasma samples from patients in each of the
six Ishak stages of hepatic fibrosis (stages 1–6) were used for
Western blotting (Table 1). These 16 samples were blotted for the
markers in FibroTest, ELF test, Hepascore and FIBROSpect and
our novel fibrosis markers. Immunoblotting was performed
essentially as previously described. [20] Four plasma samples
from controls (Ishak score 0) and two plasma samples from patients
in each of the six Ishak stages of hepatic fibrosis (stages 1–6) were
resolved on 17-well SDS-PAGE gels. Separated plasma proteins
were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL;
GE Healthcare, Bucks, UK), blocked in 0.2% (w/v) casein for 2 h
at room temperature, and probed successively with primary
antibodies at 4uC and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled
secondary antibodies at room temperature. Bands were detected
with Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus reagent (ECL Plus) (GE

secondary HRP conjugated antibodies used for Western blotting
are listed in Method S1. The non-protein marker hyaluronic acid
was measured using a competitive ELISA and total bilirubin and
gamma glutamyltranspeptidase were measured by the Biochem￾istry department in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford (see
Method S1).
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
The Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems,
CA, USA) was used to investigate possible interactions between all
proteins identified. Interactive pathways were generated to observe
potential direct and indirect relations among the differentially
expressed proteins.
Results
Identification of Candidate Biomarkers
A synthetic gel image representative of all features in the
differential analysis comparing samples from all control and
cirrhosis patients is shown in Figure 1. Original gel images for all
ten gels are shown in Figure S1. Zoomed images of the gel regions
depicting differential expression for selected novel candidate
fibrosis biomarkers are shown in Figure 2. The image analysis
software and statistical analysis found 243 statistically significant
differentially expressed features of which 57 were considered
suitable after validating by visualizing the differentially expressed
features across all gels in a montage format. These 57 features
were excised, digested with trypsin and analysed by LC-MSMS.
Since some features contained more than one protein, among the
57 features a total of 85 proteins were identified and are listed in
Table S2. For proteins identified with one peptide, the MSMS
spectra are shown in Figure S2. Many of the proteins were
identified as the same protein at different locations on the gels and
so among these 85 proteins we identified 43 candidate biomarkers
for hepatic fibrosis which are shown in Table S2. This table shows
that in many cases the same protein spot contained more than one
protein. The protein with the highest protein score has the greatest
abundance and is therefore more likely to be the differentially
expressed biomarker although the other proteins with lower
protein score should not be ruled out. Among the 43 candidate
biomarkers, 29 were top scoring proteins of which 20 were novel
blood markers for fibrosis and not seen in our earlier study [13].
Table 2 shows a summary of all these 20 proteins with their
function.
This analysis showed that expression of lipid transfer inhibitor
protein, an isoform of beta haptoglobin at pH 5.46–5.49,
haptoglobin-related protein, apolipoprotein C-III, apolipoprotein
E, C4b-binding protein beta chain, retinol-binding protein 4,
afamin, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, corticosteroid-binding globulin,
leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein and fibrinogen gamma chain
was decreased in cirrhotic plasma, whereas expression of intact
complement C3dg, immunoglobulin J chain, sex hormone-binding
globulin, 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta and adiponectin increased.
Features containing the glycoproteins alpha-1-antitrypsin, hemo￾pexin and apolipoprotein J were increased and decreased at
different locations on the gels suggesting potential post-trans￾lational modification of these proteins. In addition to these novel
candidate markers for fibrosis, we also identified proteins already
seen in our previous study [13] (decrease in albumin, a1
antichymotrypsin, complement C4, inter-a-trypsin inhibitor heavy
chain H4, paraoxonase/arylesterase 1, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein
and the elevation in immunoglobulin chains and CD5L).
Haptoglobin and its Isoform at pH 5.46–5.49 as a Novel
Fibrosis Marker
Haptoglobin was chosen for further peptide sequence analysis
since an isoform of its beta chain decreased more consistently than
the alpha chain of haptoglobin and the other beta haptoglobin
isoforms. The decrease in haptoglobin in cirrhosis was observed at
approximately 17 kDa and 40 kDa (Figure 1 and Table S2) and
the identified peptides in Figure S3A show that the features at
these molecular weights correspond to the alpha chain and
glycosylated beta chain, respectively. The beta chain of haptoglo￾bin was seen as an array of evenly spaced features between pH 4.7
and 5.5 (Figure 2C upper panel). The alpha and beta chains did
not consistently decrease in cirrhosis (Figure 2C upper panel and
Figure S3B/S3C/S3D). However, one isoform for beta haptoglo￾bin at approximately pH 5.46–5.49 decreased more consistently
than the alpha chain of haptoglobin and the other beta
haptoglobin isoforms (Figure 2C and Figure S3E). The pH of
this isoform was determined by calibrating all gels using landmarks
with known pH and molecular weights.
Complement C3dg Increases and Thioester Cleaved
Complement C3 Decreases in Cirrhosis
Complement C3 has several cleavage products within its
sequence and was chosen for further peptide sequence analysis
to identify which cleavage product was higher in cirrhotic patient
plasma. A fragment of complement C3 increased in cirrhosis and
was observed on the 2-DE gel at 38 kDa with an approximate
isoelectric point of pI 4.9 (Figure 2B). The peptide sequences
identified by mass spectrometry are shown in Figure 3 and span
from amino acids 955 to 1201. The amino acids for complement
C3dg span from 955 to 1303 and its theoretical molecular weight
and isoelectric point (39 kDa and pI 5) are in line with the
observed gel feature indicating that the fragment of complement
C3 in the feature is complement C3dg. Western blots using anti￾complement C3d antibodies showed one band decreasing with
increasing fibrosis stage (Figures 4 and 5), which is possibly
thioester cleaved Complement C3 containing C3d.
Biomarker Validation by Western Blotting
The novel candidate markers of fibrosis identified in this study
and in our previous study [13] were validated by Western blotting
using plasma from patients across all Ishak fibrosis scores. The
same patient plasma samples were blotted for the protein markers
in the FibroTest, ELF test, Hepascore and FIBROSpect and were
compared to our novel fibrosis markers. Figures 4 and 5 show our
top five markers which appear to be most reliably changing in
expression across the Ishak fibrosis scores: lipid transfer inhibitor
protein (LTIP), complement C3d, apolipoprotein J, corticosteroid￾binding globulin and finally apolipoprotein L1 which we identified
in our previous study [13]. These five markers are different from
the markers used in FibroTest, ELF test, Hepascore, FIBROSpect
and other hepatic fibrosis markers. LTIP and complement C3d
appeared to be the most superior markers showing clear
expression differences between neighbouring stages. Both apoli￾poprotein L1 and apolipoprotein J showed a clear change in
expression between the early stages of fibrosis (up to Ishak stage 3)
and more advanced hepatic fibrosis (Ishak stages 4–6). Cortico￾steroid-binding globulin was high in healthy controls and
consistently lower in Ishak stages 1–6. Figure S4 shows Western
blots for the other novel markers of fibrosis we identified (afamin,
adiponectin, IgJ, hemopexin, 14-3-3zeta, apolipoprotein E,
apolipoprotein C-III) as well as other markers we identified in
a previous study [13] (beta 2 glycoprotein-I, inter-alpha-trypsin

inhibitor heavy chain H4, CD5L and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein).
Although these markers were identified to be significantly
changing when comparing plasma and serum of healthy and
cirrhotic individuals by 2-DE, they did not appear to show
a reliable trend when analysing all Ishak stages by Western
blotting. Figure 4 shows Western blot, ELISA and liver function

haptoglobin, alpha 2 macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, total
bilirubin and gamma glutamyltranspeptidase) using all Ishak
fibrosis stages. The data in this figure and Figure 5 show that our
top five markers show a consistent decrease with increasing fibrosis
stage.
Discussion
Currently the primary tool for diagnosing and assessing hepatic
fibrosis is by liver biopsy and a less invasive and reliable biological
marker is needed. In this study we identified 44 candidate
biomarkers for hepatic fibrosis of which 20 are novel blood
markers of fibrosis and not seen in our earlier study [13]. The
novel markers of fibrosis were validated by Western blotting with
a range of fibrosis scores. This validation helped us to find five
promising biomarkers, LTIP, complement C3d, apolipoprotein J,
corticosteroid-binding globulin and apolipoprotein L1. All of these
markers looked very promising when compared to the markers in
FibroTest, ELF test, Hepascore and FIBROSpect.
We have previously applied a proteomics approach using 2-DE
over the wide pH 3–10 range to identify candidate fibrosis
biomarkers [13]. Although there is the limitation of a narrow
dynamic range when using gel-based proteomics there is the
advantage of detecting post-translational modifications and
according to a recent review [21], we have discovered more
secreted human biomarkers in liver fibrosis than any other
proteomics study which uses either mass spectrometry or gel-based
approaches. In the study presented here, we have increased our
panel of biomarkers for hepatic fibrosis and successfully identified
more potential fibrosis biomarkers than our earlier proteomics
study. The reason for our success in finding several more
candidate markers is because we have used a new proteomics
method that is more sensitive and helps to see low abundance
biomarkers. We focused on the narrow pH 3–5.6 range of the
plasma proteome using 2-DE. This range was chosen since it is
outside the range of highly abundant albumin, transferrin and
immunoglobulins and therefore this pH range allows a greater
amount of plasma protein to be loaded onto the gels compared to
our previous pH 3–10 study. The narrow pH range with the
higher load also enhances representation of low abundance
features. An alternative approach would be to deplete these highly
abundant proteins prior to 2-DE. Albumin has been depleted in an
earlier 2-DE fibrosis marker study by White and coworkers which
has revealed the same biomarkers as identified in our previous
study, but also apolipoprotein AIV [14] which was not observed in
our previous or current studies. This highlights an advantage of
using depletion compared to our approach and we are currently
looking into immunodepletion of our samples. However our

of fibrosis which were not observed by White and coworkers when
using depletion, and all of these were different to the proteins used
in FibroTest, ELF test, Hepascore and FIBROSpect and other
established fibrosis tests. Also the P100 tubes used to collect the

which may have helped to identify the novel biomarkers of fibrosis.

be decreasing in cirrhosis, these proteins were identified in a feature
containing another protein, haptoglobin, which was identified with
higher protein score and thus we were uncertain if these proteins
could be candidate biomarkers. The increased separation used in
this study clearly resolves differentially expressed features where
only zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein and paraoxonase/arylesterase 1
were identified as novel markers of fibrosis.
It is unclear why the proteins we identified are markers for liver
fibrosis. Below we discuss the potential involvement of our
promising five novel biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis and the
potential involvement of the following novel fibrosis biomarkers is
shown in Table S3: apolipoprotein C-III, apolipoprotein E,
hemopexin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (gene SERPINA3), alpha￾1-antitrypsin (gene SERPINA1), C4b-binding protein beta chain.
Information about the proteins, including amino acid sequence
and sites of glycosylation, was derived from the ExPASy database
(http://www.expasy.ch/).
We found LTIP to be decreased in cirrhosis and to be the most
promising novel biomarker of fibrosis changing across the Ishak
stages when validated by Western blotting, showing clear
differences in expression between neighbouring stages. LTIP is
a 29 kDa glyco- and apolipoprotein found in both LDL and HDL
which can inhibit lipid transfer between lipoproteins. LTIP is
known to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-
mediated cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer [22]. To our
knowledge LTIP has never been identified as a biomarker for liver
fibrosis or described in any virus system. An increase in CETP has
already been described in primary biliary cirrhosis [23] which is
consistent with the LTIP decrease observed in our study, making
this glycoprotein an attractive novel biomarker candidate for
hepatic scarring. The CETPs, which can be inhibited by LTIP,
are functionally similar to microsomal triglyceride transfer proteins
(MTP) which are also involved in triglyceride and cholesteryl ester
transport, but between phospholipid surfaces. Since both MTP
and CETP are involved in triglyceride and cholesteryl ester
transport, inhibitors against either act as lipid-lowering agents and
inhibitors against MTP can reduce CETP activity [24] although it
is not known if CETP inhibitors like LTIP can affect MTP activity.
MTP is essential for HCV production and is enriched in
membrane vesicles in which the virus replication complex is
located [25]. While it is tempting to speculate on an association
between LTIP and HCV due to these relationships between
HCV-MTP-CETP and LTIP-CETP, the decreased LTIP expres￾sion is more likely to be associated with hepatic scarring due to the
previously reported increase in CETP in cirrhosis [23].
In addition to LTIP, other proteins in the apolipoprotein family
were found to be differentially expressed: post-translational
modification of apolipoprotein J and decreased expression of
apolipoproteins C-III and E. Apolipoprotein J is a glycoprotein
chaperone associated with elastic fibres in liver fibrosis and
cirrhosis [26]. Another apolipoprotein, L1, was found to decrease
in our previous study [13] indicating that several proteins in the
apolipoprotein family appear to be related to hepatic fibrosis. We
are currently investigating whether other apolipoproteins, which
we have not identified due to low abundance or their gel location
outside the pH 3–5.6 range investigated, could also serve as
biomarkers. Western blots of both apolipoprotein L1 and
apolipoprotein J showed a similar trend in expression with
consistently high levels in the early stages of fibrosis (up to Ishak
stage 3) and consistently lower levels in more advanced hepatic
scarring (Ishak stages 4–6). These markers would therefore be
beneficial in differentiating patients with mild fibrosis from those
with more advanced fibrosis.
We found an isoform of beta haptoglobin at pH 5.46–5.49 to be
a novel marker of fibrosis which decreases in liver fibrosis. This
acute phase protein is a tetramer consisting of two 16 kDa alpha
chains with no potential sites of glycosylation and two 27 kDa beta
chains each of which has four potential sites of N-glycosylation
[27]. The array of evenly spaced features for the beta chain
(Figure 2) is due to differences in glycosylation for each feature
[28]. Total haptoglobin is known to decrease in fibrosis and is
presently used along with other proteins to diagnose liver fibrosis
[5]. Our data shows that total haptoglobin is unreliable as a fibrosis
marker since both alpha and beta chains do not consistently
decrease in cirrhosis (Figure S3). Furthermore, the 2-DE profile for
cirrhosis patient 5 looks different to the other gels since, unlike the
other cirrhotic samples, this patient had very low levels of
haptoglobin. Some cirrhotic patients have very low haptoglobin
and the observation was also noted in our previous study [13].
Therefore this gel is a fair representation of the expression of this
protein in some cirrhotic samples. It also illustrates that
haptoglobin is not consistent and its levels can be considerably
different among cirrhotic patients. The isoform of beta haptoglo￾bin identified as a novel marker of fibrosis appears to be more
reliable than currently used total haptoglobin [5]. This isoform of
haptoglobin has glycans which are mainly biantennary, both
mono- or disialylated with hardly any tri- or tetra-antennary/
sialylated structures and less sialic acid and more monosialylated
structures than the other haptoglobin isoforms of lower pH [29].
The different glycosylation pattern on this isoform compared to
the other isoforms is currently being investigated. Hemolytic stress
in haptoglobin-hemopexin double-null mice, but not single knock￾out mice, causes pronounced fibrosis [30] suggesting that both
haptoglobin and hemopexin, which was also identified in this
study, are important for protection from liver fibrosis.
Three of the proteins identified to be differentially expressed
were members of the serpin protease inhibitor family: gene names
SERPINA6, SERPINA3 and SERPINA1. Corticosteroid-binding
globulin (gene SERPINA6) is decreased in cirrhosis compared to
healthy controls and our Western blot data showed that this
marker was high in healthy controls and generally lower in Ishak
stages 1–6. HCV patients with Ishak stage 0 disease would also
need to be analysed to see if corticosteroid-binding globulin is
beneficial in determining early hepatic scarring.
A fragment of complement C3 was found to be increased in
cirrhosis. Two other proteins involved in the complement cascade,
complement C4 and C4b-binding protein beta chain, were found
to decrease in cirrhosis. Opposing the increase in complement C3
seen here, we have previously shown a fragment of C3 decreasing
in cirrhosis [13]. In our earlier study we show that this fragment
decreasing in cirrhosis contains peptides corresponding to the a￾chain of C3 preceding its thioester site (the location of this site is
highlighted in Figure 3). The cleavage at the thioester site was
thought to be caused by plasmin, an enzyme involved in

fibrinolysis, and the theoretical pI and molecular weight of the
cleaved fragment were in agreement with the observed feature on
the gel. This led us to suspect that the decreased levels of the
thioester cleaved fragment may indicate less plasmin-mediated
cleavage of the complement C3 a-chain, a finding consistent with
hepatic scarring. We now further support this hypothesis by
showing that C3dg, which is not cleaved since peptides were
identified on either side of the thioester site (Figure 3), is elevated
in cirrhosis. Complement C3dg can be cleaved at this thioester site
by plasmin into C3d and C3g. Western blots were performed
using anti-complement C3d antibodies to detect fragments of
Complement C3 where C3dg is intact (expected increase in
cirrhosis) and fragments of Complement C3 containing C3d where
plasmin has cleaved the thioester site (expected decrease in
cirrhosis). Results showed that there was only one band decreasing
with increasing fibrosis stage (Figure 4 and 5). The increase in
Complement C3 where C3dg is intact may have not been
observed since it may be below the level of detection and the 2-DE
data confirms that C3dg is in very low abundance (Figure 2B). The
fact that the increase in C3dg is not visible by Western blotting is
an advantage since if it was observed it may mask the decrease in
thioester cleaved Complement C3 containing C3d making it a less
reliable biomarker. To our knowledge, this is the first time it has
been indicated that there is decreased thioester cleavage of
complement C3 in cirrhosis.
Potential interactions between all the differentially expressed
proteins were analysed using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
software. A network diagram showing potential interactions
between the proteins is shown in Figure S5. Interestingly the
software recognized that some of the proteins identified were
related to transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta1) which is
the main fibrogenic cytokine in hepatic scarring [2] suggesting that
these proteins are related to pathways involved in fibrogenesis.
The Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software showed that the
proteins identified were most closely related to canonical pathways
involved in the acute phase response which is consistent with the
hepatic scarring process since inflammation has an association
with fibrogenesis.
Information about the patients used in this study is shown in
Table S1. The 50 patients analysed in this study varied in age and
sex. It is preferable if markers are not dependent on categories
such as these and so we aimed to eliminate any group specific hits
from the outset. The FibroTest and Hepascore are dependent on
age and gender [5,10] whereas the ELF test which initially used
age was later found to be independent of this category [7,31]. For
the Western blots in Figure 4, plasma samples from both males
and females were analysed in most of the 7 Ishak stages of fibrosis
(stages 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5) except for stages 4 and 6 where samples
were only available from males (Table 1). Since our samples were
from patients mixed in gender for most of the stages, the Western
blot data suggest that our markers do not rely on age or sex and
this will need to be confirmed using a greater number of samples.
Conclusions
This study shows how we used 2-DE gels with a narrow pH 3–
5.6 range to identify candidate plasma biomarkers for liver fibrosis
in hepatitis C patients. We identified 44 candidate biomarkers for
hepatic fibrosis in HCV patients of which 20 were novel
biomarkers of fibrosis and not seen earlier [13]. Western blot
validation helped to find five promising biomarkers, which we are
currently further validating, alongside the other markers we
identified here and in our previous study, using dot blotting and
ELISAs with a statistically relevant larger patient population. This
will help us to determine the concentrations of each of our markers
in plasma and their precision and performance. We are also
looking into comparing markers found by gel-free mass spectrom￾etry-based approaches with the markers found by our gel-based
approaches. In addition our markers will be investigated in other
cases of hepatic fibrosis (e.g HBV and alcohol-mediated), other
chronic liver diseases and other scarring diseases (e.g. cardiac and
skin fibrosis). The use of dot blotting and ELISAs should confirm
that one or a combination of the top five proteins already
identified can be incorporated into a clinical assay which can then
be used to establish a scoring system to aid in the assessment of
hepatic scarring. Such an assay would also aid in assessing fibrosis
reduction during therapy which would help clinicians to monitor
patient improvement during current therapy and also help in
clinical trials where new anti-fibrotic drugs are to be investigated.
Ultimately this assay would help clinicians to determine the
severity of hepatic fibrosis and eliminate the need for invasive liver
biopsies.
