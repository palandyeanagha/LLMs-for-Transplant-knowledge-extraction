Abstract
Background: Palliative treatment with the Fontan procedure has greatly improved survival for children with
functionally univentricular heart. Since Fontan performed the first successful operation, the procedure has evolved
and is now performed as Total Cavo-Pulmonary Connection (TCPC).
An increasing prevalence and longer life expectancy of TCPC patients have raised new challenges. The survivors are
often suffering complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, thromboembolic events,
neuropsychological deficit, protein-losing enteropathy and reduced exercise capacity. Several causes for the
reduced exercise capacity may be present e.g. impaired function of the single ventricle, valve dysfunction and
chronotropic impairment, and perhaps also increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Thus, plasma endothelin-1 has
been shown to correlate with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and the risk of failing Fontan circulation. This
has raised the question of the role for pulmonary vasodilation therapy, especially endothelin receptor antagonist in
the management of TCPC patients.
Methods/Design: The TEMPO trial aims to investigate whether Bosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, can be
administered safely and improve exercise capacity in TCPC patients. The trial design is randomized, double-blind and
placebo-controlled. Bosentan/placebo is administered for 14 weeks with control visits every four weeks. The primary
endpoint is change in maximal oxygen consumption as assessed on bicycle ergometer test. Secondary endpoints
include changes in pulmonary blood flow during exercise test, pro brain natriuretic peptide and quality of life.
Discussion: We hypothesize that treatment with Bosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, can be administered
safely and improve exercise capacity in TCPC patients.

Background
Functionally univentricular hearts (UVH) include congeni￾tal defects with hypoplasia of either the right or the left
ventricle, which, as a consequence, cannot drive a pulmon￾ary or systemic circulation alone. The natural history of
UVH is poor with reported one-year survival rates less
than 50% [1]. Introduction of palliative surgical treatment
by Fontan in 1971 [2] has dramatically improved survival.
The technique has evolved [3,4] and is currently performed
as Total Cavo-Pulmonary Connection (TCPC). Although
the procedure remains palliative rather than curative, the
10-year survival rate post-surgery increased from 50% in
the first Fontan patients to 90% currently [5-7].
The complete TCPC is typically carried out in three
stages. Generally, the first stage is undertaken in the
neonatal period and aims at regulating the pulmonary
blood flow to an adequate level, either by reducing or in￾creasing pulmonary flow using a pulmonary banding or a
shunt, respectively, but also securing that systemic perfu￾sion and mixing remains unobstructed. The second stage

is the bidirectional Glenn procedure, where the superior
vena cava is anastomosed to the pulmonary artery. In the
third stage, the TCPC circulation is established by divert￾ing the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery, thus
allowing almost complete systemic venous bypass of the
heart. The second and third stages are usually performed
between six months and three years of age.
The prevalence of TCPC patients has steadily increased
over the past decades. A recent Danish population￾based study found 43 surviving UVH patients per mil￾lion inhabitants, 37 of whom were palliated with
Fontan/TCPC [8]. Despite improved survival, TCPC is
still associated with high morbidity. Myocardial dys￾function, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, neuro￾psychological deficits, protein-losing enteropathy, and
reduced exercise capacity are among the most com￾monly reported long-term complications [9-12].
In the TCPC, pulmonary flow is driven without sup￾port from a sub-pulmonary ventricle. Thus, even a slight
increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) may
compromise the pulmonary circulation which in turn
may result in decreased preload of the ventricle, limiting
cardiac output (CO) and exercise tolerance [13,14]. An
increased pulmonary blood flow prior the Glenn anasto￾mosis may contribute the elevated PVR in some patients.
Furthermore, the non-pulsatile pulmonary blood-flow
following the TCPC procedure may also increase PVR
through remodeling, as shown in an animal model [15].
This is supported by the fact that raised levels of the po￾tent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 correlate with in￾creased PVR and failure of the Fontan circulation
[11,16]. Furthermore, endothelin-1 is elevated in many
UVH patients before surgical palliation [17]. This raises
the question whether pulmonary vasodilators may have
a role in the treatment of this patient group.
Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) not only have
an immediate vasodilating effect on the pulmonary vas￾culature, but also a long term effect in its inhibition of
the structural remodeling of the pulmonary microcircu￾lation, thus theoretically improving exercise capacity in
patients with TCPC circulation. Accordingly, small stud￾ies have shown that oral treatment with pulmonary va￾sodilators, including ERAs improves hemodynamics and
exercise capacity after TCPC operation [18-21].
The TEMPO trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled
and double-blinded study. The aim is to investigate
whether Bosentan, an ERA, can improve exercise cap￾acity and is safe to administer to TCPC patients.
Methods/Design
Participants
The participants are recruited among all registered TCPC
patients over 12 years of age from the four participating ter￾tiary centers; two Danish centers; Copenhagen University
Hospital, Rigshospitalet and Aarhus University Hospital,
Skejby and two Swedish centers; Karolinska Institutet in
Stockholm and Lund University Hospital. Subjects who
fulfill the inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion
criteria (Table 1) are contacted, aiming for 78 participants.
All participants receive written and oral information in
their own language, and sign an informed consent form
before enrollment.
Demographic and diagnostic data as well as blood
samples are recorded at baseline (Table 2).
Endpoints
Endpoints are given in Table 3. Maximal oxygen con￾sumption (peakVO2), pulmonary blood flow, oxygen
consumption at anaerobic threshold (VO2 [AT]) and
maximal work load are all calculated from results of a
bicycle ergometer test, performed at Institute of Sports
Medicine Copenhagen, as described below. Blood sam￾ples and SF36 quality of life questionnaire are obtained
at the baseline and endpoint visits. NYHA class is deter￾mined before the bicycle test. Fecal samples for α-1
antitrypsin are collected by the participant at home and
subsequently sent in a provided envelope for analysis. It
is optional for participants to partake in this endpoint.
Bicycle ergometer test
The primary endpoint is improvement in peakVO2 (ml/
min and ml/min/kg body weight) obtained during a bicycle
ergometer test. All tests are performed on the same equip￾ment (Monark Ergomedic 839E, Monark Exercise AB,

Sweden), at the same site and with the same staff present.
An individualized incremental protocol is chosen for each
patient, with the purpose of reaching maximal effort within
6–12 minutes. All participants start with one to two mi￾nutes warm-up. After this, the test protocol starts at either
20 Watt increasing stepwise 20 Watt/min or starting at 25
Watt increasing 25 Watt/min. Before each test the flow￾meter and gas analyzer are calibrated. During the test elec￾trocardiography and percutaneous oxygen saturation are
measured continuously. The participants wear a mask with
a TripleV flow-meter (Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany) to
measure respiration volume, and a tube for breath-by￾breath sampling to measure O2 and CO2 concentrations
via Masterscreen CPX (CareFusion, San Diego, CA, USA).
All measures are given as the average over 15 seconds in￾tervals subtracting the highest and lowest value. Pulmonary
blood flow is calculated continuously by the test software
using the Stringer-Wassermann method [22]. Only partici￾pants without patent fenestration of the TCPC tunnel are
considered for this endpoint.
The principal investigator is present at all tests to mo￾tivate patients to reach maximal effort in both pre- and
post-treatment tests. Furthermore, Respiratory Exchange
Ratio (RER) is measured, and a value of ≥1.1 is consid￾ered acceptable as an indicator of maximal effort. Pa￾tients who are unable to reach RER ≥1.1 in either the
pre- or post-treatment test will not be considered in the
statistical analysis for the primary endpoint. PeakVO2 is
defined as the 15 second interval with the highest value
of VO2.
Anaerobic threshold is defined as the first 15 second
interval where the average RER passes the value 1.0
without falling below 1.0 later [23].
It is considered unnecessary to make the participants
undergo a “dummy test” before enrollment since pa￾tients in the Scandinavian countries are familiar with bi￾cycles, and exercise testing is frequently used in the
clinical follow-up of TCPC patients. Furthermore, this
was confirmed in a recent feasibility study where six
Danish patients with congenital heart disease and one
healthy adolescent were tested twice within six weeks,
demonstrating excellent reproducibility, with an intra￾class correlation coefficient of 0.99 [24].
Trial design
The trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo￾controlled clinical trial. Patients with TCPC palliated
UVH, are eligible for enrollment. Participants are ran￾domized 1:1 to parallel groups of treatment or placebo
(Figure 1). The Bosentan dose regimen is the same as
used in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension
[25]. Participants receive oral placebo or Bosentan 62.5
mg b.i.d. for two weeks followed by 125 mg b.i.d. for 12
weeks. For patients with a body weight below 35 kg, the
dose is halved i.e. 31.25 mg b.i.d. for two weeks and 62.5
mg b.i.d. for 12 weeks.
Medication/Randomization
At enrollment participants receive a package with four
glasses each containing 70 tablets; one with placebo or
Bosentan 62.5 mg tablets for the first two weeks, and
three with placebo or Bosentan 125 mg for the
remaining 12 weeks. The study medication is delivered
by Actelion Pharmaceuticals packed, labeled and num￾bered. The packages are randomized when received by
the investigators. Randomization is done via a comput￾erized model, and only the manufacturer knows the
randomization status.
At each visit the remaining tablets are counted to con￾trol compliance. Patients who take at least 80% of the
intended tablets are defined as “per protocol” whereas
the rest are counted as “intention to treat”.

Safety/visits
During the study, participants will have a total of five
visits (Table 4), three of which are intermediary controls
to ensure safety. All tests at the baseline and final visit
are performed in Copenhagen, whereas the first inter￾mediary visit after two weeks must take place in one of
the four participating tertiary centers. Control visits may
take place at a local hospital or at the general practitioner’s
office, in case this is more convenient to the participant.
When starting medication at baseline and when in￾creasing the dose after two weeks a special safety meas￾ure is taken. Each participant has blood pressure, heart

rate and percutaneous oxygen saturation measured before
the medication is given. Blood pressure is then measured
one and two hours after the medication is administered. If
symptoms of hypotension and a decrease in systolic blood
pressure over 20% are seen, the participant will be evalu￾ated by clinical experts and possibly excluded.
Female participants are advised about contraception
methods, and encouraged to contact the study group
with any suspicion of pregnancy. At every visit s-hCG is
measured.
In case of serious adverse events the medication is
stopped and the patient is excluded. Moreover, adverse
events (Table 5) lead to exclusion of the study or con￾tinuation at a lower dose of medication.
Sample size calculation
Average peakVO2 in adult TCPC patients is approxi￾mately 20 ml/kg/min [10]. Assuming that 14 weeks
treatment with Bosentan compared to placebo will
increase in the primary endpoint peakVO2 by 20%, an
increase of 4 ml/kg/min is expected.
The standard deviation (SD) of a single measurement of
maximal VO2 in TCPC adults is reported to range from
2.5 to 5.8 ml/kg/min [10,18]. Thus, a weighted mean SD
of 4.3 ml/kg/min is used in the calculations in this study.
The intra-patient correlation is assumed to be 0.5, and
the required power is 90% at a significance level of 95%.
With a paired t-test, the number needed in each group
is 24. Exclusion due to elevated liver enzymes is
expected in 5%, low medication compliance in 15%,
whereas drop-outs are expected in 33% of the partici￾pants. Thus, 39 patients will be included in each group.
Discussion
Surgical and medical advances in recent decades have
improved the survival of children born with UVH;
hence, we can expect a higher prevalence and an in￾creasing age of patients palliated with TCPC in the
future. When older, impaired exercise capacity may be
an important long-term complication in TCPC patients.
The TEMPO study hypothesizes that the ERA Bosentan
partly may counteract this effect, particularly considering
the finding of high plasma levels of endothelin-1 in
UVH and TCPC palliated patients.
Current evidence is pointing toward the lack of pre￾load reserve as the most important factor in limiting CO
in TCPC patients [13,14]. In the healthy biventricular in￾dividual, the CO is readily increased with a reduction in
afterload, augmentation of ventricular contractility or in￾crease in heart rate. The effect of these factors is
dependent on an abundant preload reserve, in the ab￾sence of which CO increase would suffer. In the Fontan
circulation there is limited preload reserve due to the
passive pulmonary flow. In a ramp exercise test, an in￾crease in heart rate will reflect positively on CO as long
as the preload is kept intact. Since this may not be the
fact in a TCPC circulation, any further increase in heart
rate will more likely decrease the stroke volume. The
lowering of PVR may increase pulmonary blood flow
and thereby preload reserve in Fontan patients, and due
to this pulmonary vasodilating therapy is interesting as a
means to improve the Fontan circulation. The limited pre￾load reserve is most likely to stem from PVR in the “healthy
Fontans”, but in cases where the Fontan conduit itself is re￾strictive, lowering the PVR would not be effective. As a
consequence, patients with documented restrictive Fontan
circuit on prior imaging are excluded from this study.
Pulmonary vasodilation therapy in the form of Sildena￾fil was previously evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial
with TCPC patients both by Giardini et al. [18] and
Goldberg et al. [26] showing an increase in peakVO2 and
ventilatory efficiency, respectively. An open-label study
on the effect of ERA in TCPC patients showed no effect
on peakVO2 [27]; however, the study population was
relatively small with only 32 patients finishing with end￾point. Furthermore, the safety of ERA treatment to
TCPC patients has recently been evaluated in an open￾label pilot study [28]. Thus, the TEMPO-study is the
first randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate
the safety and effect of ERA on peakVO2 in a TCPC
population.
The primary endpoint of this trial is peakVO2; a test
that is notoriously difficult to reproduce reliably, partly
due to the fact that tests are often performed on differ￾ent equipment, with different staff present, and with dif￾ferent levels of motivation. The quality of the primary
endpoint data is of utmost importance, and testing all
patients at the same location, with the same equipment
and staff should secure the highest level of inter-test
reliability.
In order to get a better understanding of the effect or
lack of effect of ERA on the Fontan circulation, this

study uses the non-invasive estimate of CO during exer￾cise proposed by Wassermann et al. [22]. Though
proven very reliable in healthy individuals as well as in
patients with chronic heart failure [29,30], this method
has to the investigators’ knowledge not yet been vali￾dated in Fontan patients. However, considering the na￾ture of the method it is quite sane to assume that it will
be as accurate and precise in Fontan patients as it is in
chronic heart failure and healthy individuals.
The method is based on the fact that the differ￾ence in blood O2 content from arterial to mixed
venous (C[a-vDO2]) develops linearly in relation to
change in oxygen consumption (VO2) from rest (0%) to
maximum uptake (100%) by the following regression line:
C a−vDO2 ð Þ¼ 5:72 þ 0:105  %V_ O2 max ; ⋅r ¼ 0:94
VO2 is measured continuously, so CO can be calcu￾lated using the direct Fick method:
CO ¼ VO_ 2
C a  vDO2 ð Þ
In Fontan patients without significant shunts, virtually
all the blood passes through the pulmonary circulation,
as is the case in a biventricular circulation without
shunts. None of the assumptions of the method are vio￾lated in the Fontan circulation without shunts.
Ethical considerations
The Danish Ethics Committee, the Danish Medicines
Agency, and the Danish Board for Data Protection ap￾prove the study. The Swedish Ethics Committee are in￾formed about the study, and agree with the Danish
Committee without making a separate approval, as all
the endpoint tests are done in Denmark and the medi￾cine is delivered to the patients in Denmark. This means
that the study takes place in Denmark only, but with
Swedish patients participating under the Danish laws of
patient rights and under Danish insurance.
Monitoring
The study complies with the standards of Good Clinical
Practice ICH-GCP. The GCP unit of Copenhagen moni￾tors all aspects of the study according to the guidelines
of ICH-GCP including initiation visit, planned inter￾mediary control visits and end-of-study visit. Further￾more they can make visits unannounced if need be.
