Abstract
Background: As organ shortage is increasing, the acceptance of marginal donors increases, which might result in
poor organ function and patient survival. Mostly, organ damage is caused during brain death (BD), cold ischemic
time (CIT) or after reperfusion due to oxidative stress or the induction of apoptosis. The aim of this study was to
study a panel of genes involved in oxidative stress and apoptosis and compare these findings with
immunohistochemistry from a BD and living donation (LD) pig model and after cold ischemia time (CIT).
Methods: BD was induced in pigs; after 12 h organ retrieval was performed; heart, liver and kidney tissue specimens
were collected in the BD (n = 6) and in a LD model (n = 6). PCR analysis for NFKB1, GSS, SOD2, PPAR-alpha, OXSR1,
BAX, BCL2L1, and HSP 70.2 was performed and immunohistochemistry used to show apoptosis and nitrosative stress
induced cell damage.
Results: In heart tissue of BD BAX, BCL2L1 and HSP 70.2 increased significantly after CIT. Only SOD2 was over-expressed
after CIT in BD liver tissue. In kidney tissue, BCL2L1, NFKB, OXSR1, SOD2 and HSP 70.2 expression was significantly
elevated in LD. Immunohistochemistry showed a significant increase in activated Caspase 3 and nitrotyrosine positive
cells after CIT in BD in liver and in kidney tissue but not in heart tissue.
Conclusion: The up-regulation of protective and apoptotic genes seems to be divergent in the different organs in the
BD and LD setting; however, immunohistochemistry revealed more apoptotic and nitrotyrosine positive cells in the BD
setting in liver and kidney tissue whereas in heart tissue both BD and LD showed an increase.

Background
Whole organ transplantation still remains the therapy of
choice for several end-stage organ failures. As the de￾mand for organs is increasing steadily, donor selection
criteria are expanded and therefore strategies to improve
the quality of such marginal donors are needed. It is
known that the clinical outcome in kidney transplant￾ation from living donors (LD) is superior to that for
transplantation from brain dead (BD) donors [1]. How￾ever, most organs are transplanted from BD and, there￾fore, a focus on characterization of pathophysiological
pathways that cause organ damage is essential in order
to be able to ameliorate transplantation outcome. BD, due
to massive catecholamine release, is followed by significant
hemodynamic disturbances and ischemia that occurs be￾fore organ retrieval has begun and leads to the induction
of oxidative stress [1,2]. Oxidative stress has been impli￾cated in development of complications after organ trans￾plantation emphasizing on ischemia-reperfusion injury
(IRI), delayed graft function (DGF) [3] and primary allo￾graft dysfunction which remains a serious problem in
organ transplantation [4]. The occurrence of oxidative
stress as well as apoptosis and nitrosative stress induced
cell damage in LD and BD is therefore of interest. As there
exist a lot of small animal experiments in this setting [5,6],
but large animal studies are rare, we decided to analyzed
apoptosis related genes (NFKB [7], BAX – BCL2 associated
X protein [8]; BCL2L1 [9]) as well as oxidative stress

related genes (SOD2, GSS, PPARalpha, OXSR1, GPX3,
HSP 70.2) in a pig model of LD and BD organ donation.
NFKB is known to play a key role in initiation of inflam￾mation and rejection as well as occurrence of apoptosis
in organ transplantation [7,10]. Taking in consideration
BCL2L1 a product of an anti-apoptotic gene as well as
BAX, a pro-apoptotic gene, the susceptibility of cells to￾ward apoptotic stimuli can be defined [8,9,11]. Superoxide
dismutase (SOD) encodes for an enzyme that converts
superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide [12], gluthatione
synthetase (GSS) encodes for a key enzyme in preven￾tion of local oxidative stress [13,14], the peroxisome
proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) gene
plays a role in energy metabolism and might suppress in￾duction of apoptosis [15], the gene for oxidative stress re￾sponsive 1 (OXSR1) controls cell proliferation and cell
death by apoptosis [16], gluthatione peroxidase 3 (GPX3)
encodes for a cellular anti-oxidant system that protects
cells against oxidative stress [17,18] and heat shock pro￾tein 70.2 gene expression (HSP 70.2) takes part in pro￾cesses of protection and repair of stress-induced protein
damage [19,20] in the different tissues. The aim of this
study was to study a panel of genes involved in oxida￾tive stress and apoptosis and correlate gene expression
with immunohistochemical findings of apoptosis and
nitrosative stress and serum markers of oxidative stress
before and after harvesting of organs from a BD and
LD pig model and after cold ischemia time (CIT) in
order to have the potential possibility to find novel
strategies for donor pre-conditioning and amelioration in
further experiments.
Methods
BD induction and organ/tissue harvest
12 animals (suus scrofa domestica; 35 ± 3.2kg) from
the same origin were used for these experiments. All
animal procedures were carried out in accordance with
the Austrian Animal Law (66.010/46-II/10b/2009 and
66.010/75-C/GT/2007/C/GT according to BGBl. Nr.501/
1989, i.d.F. BGBl. 1 Nr. 169/1999) and experiments were
performed in accordance with the NIH guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals [21]. Organ procure￾ment from BD (n = 6) and LD animals (n = 6) was
performed according to the local standards [22] and the
EUROTRANSPLANT guidelines [23]. For BD a slow BD
induction model was used as described elsewhere; briefly,
after drilling a burr hole in the right frontoparietal region
of the skull, a Foley catheter was inserted into the sub￾dural space. The balloon of the catheter was inflated with
saline solution at a rate of 3 ml every 30 seconds to a
total volume of 24 ml. Animals were kept at a mean ar￾terial pressure of 50 mmHg and animals were stabilized
for 10 hours according to local donor management
guidelines [22,24]. 60 min after total inflation of the
balloon, anaesthesia was discontinued and after a period
of another 60 min, BD diagnostic was performed includ￾ing testing of brain stem reflexes and painful stimuli by a
neurologist, followed by apnoea testing and a 30 min 8 -
channel EEG exactly as described elsewhere [25]. Only in
pigs with an isoelectrical EEG as well as CO2 levels above
60 mmHg during the apnoea testing, BD was confirmed.
Then, BD pigs were managed according to the current
recommendations to manage a multi organ donor. Im￾mediately prior to organ perfusion, immediately after
organ perfusion and after defined CIT tissue samples
were taken and put either on paraffin for immunohisto￾chemistry or on liquid nitrogen for PCR analysis. CIT
was 4 hours for heart tissue, 6 hours for liver and 15
hours for kidney tissue. These time-points were chosen
because they represent average acceptable CIT duration
for the respective organs.
Immunohistochemistry and histology
Prior to perfusion, after perfusion and after CIT, tissue
samples of the different organs were fixed in formalin
and embedded in paraffin and sections of 3 μm were cut
with a microtome and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin according to standard procedures.
For immunohistochemistry, antibodies against activated
human/mouse/pig Caspase 3 (Affinity-Purified Rabbit
Anti- Active Antibody, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA; dilution 1:50) were applied to deparaffinised and
rehydrated sections after antigen retrieval by microwav￾ing for 40 minutes at 160 W in 0.01 M citrate buffer, pH
6.0. Binding of primary antibodies was detected with the
iVIEW DAB Detection Kit on Ventana ES automatic
stainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tuscon, Arizona, USA).
For negative control, primary antibodies were omitted or
replaced by isotype matched immunoglobulins.
For the detection of nitrosative stress an anti￾nitrotyrosine antibody (rabbit IgG fraction, Invitrogen,
Eugene, Oregon, USA; dilution 1:200) was applied to
deparaffinised and rehydrated sections after antigen re￾trieval using CC1 reagent (Ventana Medical Systems,
Tucson, Arizona, USA) for 60 min. After 32 min of incu￾bation with the primary antibody, blocking and detection
was performed using the ultraView Universal DAB De￾tection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Arizona,
USA) on a BenchMark XT automated tissue staining sys￾tem (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Arizona, USA)
according to validated protocols. Hematoxyline served as
counterstain for nitrotyrosines.
For the quantification of activated Caspase 3 positive
cells as well as nitrosative stress damaged cells, positive
cells were evaluated by three independent investigators
semi-quantitatively and statistical analysis was performed.
Photodocumentation was performed using a Leica® DC
300 or Leica® DC 350 camera (Leica Camera AG, Solms,

Germany) and a 40 mm objective (Scan Magnification
40 mm objective, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Vienna, Austria).
Biochemistry
Full blood count, electrolytes, renal and liver function
tests were immediately analysed in the central laboratory
continuously prior to BD induction during BD and im￾mediately prior to organ donation. Blood samples were
stored at −70°C for analysis of malondialdehyde (MDA)
as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels as previously
described [26-28].
RNA Isolation and reverse transcription
Tissue samples were snap-frozen and stored in liquid ni￾trogen until nucleic acid extraction. Between 50 mg to
100 mg tissue (liver, heart, and kidney) were homoge￾nized by either cutting the tissue into sections with a
cryomicrotome and disrupting it in 1 ml TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US) by passing the suspen￾sion through a 23 gauge needle or by homogenizing the
tissue in 1 ml TRIzol reagent using a MagNA Lyser
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Isola￾tion of RNA was done according to the protocol pro￾vided by the manufacturer with minor modifications. In
brief, disrupted tissue was incubated for 15 minutes at
room temperature and treated with 100 μl 1-Bromo-3-
chloropropane (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, US) per ml TRIzol
reagent. RNA was precipitated in 500 μl isopropyl alco￾hol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, US) and the pellet was
dissolved in RNase-free water (usb, Cleveland, OH,
US). RNA was quantified spectro-photomectrically on a
Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and
stored until use at −80°C. One μg RNA was used for re￾verse transcription (QuantiTect Reverse Transcription
Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the protocol
provided by the manufacturer including a step for the
elimination of genomic DNA. The final volume of the re￾action was 20 μl.
Primer
Primers were designed based on porcine sequences
available online (ENTREZ GENE) with Primer3 software
and purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg,
Germany). For the endogenous reference gene HPRT
primers were adopted from Nygard et al. [29].
This reference gene was chosen, because it proved
high stability across different tissues [29] and is suitable for
the quantification of low abundant transcripts. Whenever
possible the primers were designed to span exon/intron
boundaries to avoid amplification of residual genomic
DNA. The specificity of the primers was first evaluated
with in-silico analysis. PCR products showed a single melt￾ing peak in the melting analysis and a single band on an
agarose gel (2.5% agarose in 1-fold TBE running buffer).
Sequence specificity was verified by sequence analysis
(3730 DNA Analyzer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
US). Sequences of primers are summarized in Table 1.
The efficiency of the primers was determined in a range
from 0.4 to 50 ng initial RNA using PCR cycling conditions
as described below. Primers showed similar efficiencies
(ranging from 1.8 to 2.0) on templates from the three dif￾ferent tissue types and the two storage solutions.
Real time PCR
Real time PCR amplification and melting analysis were
performed using a LightCycler 480 System (Roche Diag￾nostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). cDNA correspond￾ing to an equivalent of 25 ng RNA was added to a reaction
mix containing LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and
0.2 μM of each primer giving a final reaction volume
of 20 μl. The PCR reaction mixture was subjected to
an initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds, followed
by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds,
annealing at 58°C at 20 seconds and elongation at 72°C
for 30 seconds. Melting analysis started with an initial de￾naturation at 95°C for 5 seconds followed by an increase
in temperature from 65°C to 97°C with 10 acquisitions
per degree.
Data analysis real time PCR
Gene expression was determined using the efficiency
method for relative quantification embedded in the
LightCycler Software (LCS480 1.5.0.39). Inter-assay vari￾ance was calculated using the coefficient of variation
(CV) of the mean Cq value of an internal control and
was less than 1.8%. cDNA used as template for the in￾ternal control was generated from RNA isolated from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) derived from
pigs. Internal control reactions were included with each
run and amplified using the HPRT primers. All PCR re￾actions were done in duplicates.
Data analysis and statistics
All PCR experiments were carried out as duplicates. Re￾sults were normalized to the housekeeping gene (HPRT1)
and fold change was calculated as ratio of the target gene
expression in the experimental groups (after perfusion or
after CIT) to the control group (pre perfusion). Further￾more, to be able to show differences in gene expression be￾tween LD and BD, the fold change was also calculated as
ration of the target gene expression in the BD group to the
LD group. For quantification of immunohistochemistry
three blinded, independent persons analysed the slides in a
semi-quantitative manner (negative, slightly positive, posi￾tive, strongly positive) and the results were transferred to a
score form 0–3. The mean of their observations was used
for statistical analysis. For comparison of two groups t-test

or Mann–Whitney test were used as appropriate, whilst
the ANOVA test with Bonferroni´s multicomparison post
hoc analysis was used for comparison of more than two
data sets. F was >1 for all ANOVA tests. SPSS version 13
and GraphPrism 4 software was used for statistical analysis.
A p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
Results
PCR and immunohistochemistry
Heart tissue
In LD heart tissue no change in expression of apoptosis
genes (BAX, BCL2L1, NFKB) and oxidative stress genes
(GSS, GPX3, OXSR1, SOD2, HSP70.2, PPARA) after
perfusion or after CIT as compared to pre perfusion was
detected. In BD animals BAX, BCL2L1 and HSP 70.2 ex￾pression increased after CIT compared to pre perfusion
(2.7 fold, p < 0.05, 3 fold, p < 0.05 and 5.9 fold, p < 0.001
respectively). HSP70.2 expression was also significantly
higher after CIT compared to after perfusion (p < 0.001)
(Figure 1). The number of activated Caspase 3 positive
cells and nitrotyrosine positive cells increased signifi￾cantly after perfusion and after 4 h of CIT in heart tissue
of both BD and LD donor organs compared to the sam￾ples taken prior to perfusion. Nitrotyrosine positive cells
were more common in BD hearts after CIT, but not at
other time-points. Representative stainings are shown in
Figure 2 and statistical analysis compiled in Table 2.
Liver tissue
In LD and BD liver tissue no changes in expression levels
of apoptosis genes (BAX, BCL2L1, NFKB) could be
detected. From the panel of oxidative stress genes, HSP
70.2 was 2.4 fold (p < 0.05) overexpressed after CIT in LD
livers, whereas SOD2 was overexpressed after perfusion
and after CIT (3.2, p < 0.01 and 4.2 fold, p < 0.001 respect￾ively) in BD livers. (Figure 3) GPX3 was 4.3 fold (p < 0.01)
overexpressed after perfusion in LD livers compared to BD
livers indicating cell protection (data not shown).
A significant increase in nitrotyrosin positive cells
could be observed in both BD and LD livers after per￾fusion and after 6h of CIT. Caspase 3 positive and
nitrotyrosine positive cells were significantly elevated
after 6h of CIT in BD organs; activated Caspase 3 and
nitrotyrosine positive cells were significantly more com￾mon in BD as compared to LD livers prior to perfusion
and after perfusion (only nitrotyrosine). Representative
stainings are shown in Figure 2 and statistical analysis is
compiled in Table 2.
Kidney tissue
In BD kidney tissue no changes in apoptosis and oxidative
stress gene expression were observed after perfusion or
after CIT compared to pre perfusion. In LD donor kidneys
BCL2L1 was 2.4 fold (p < 0.01) over-expressed after perfu￾sion but expression was unchanged when comparing the

expression after CIT to pre perfusion. NFKB expression
was 2.9 fold (p < 0.01) over-expressed after CIT. OXSR1
(2.8 fold, p < 0.01), SOD2 (2.7 fold, p < 0.01) expression
was significantly higher after CIT in LD kidneys and HSP
70.2 expression was significantly higher after perfusion (5.6
fold, p < 0.001) and after CIT (6.5 fold, p < 0.001) (Figure 4).
BCL2L1 was 2.4 fold (p < 0.01) over-expressed in LD
kidneys after perfusion compared to BD kidneys (data
not shown.).
In kidney tissue, the number of activated Caspase 3
positive cells was significantly higher in both groups
after 15 h CIT compared to prior to perfusion and was
higher in BD donor organs compared to LD organs after
CIT. Nitrotyrosine positivity was already significantly
higher in BD as compared to LD prior and after perfu￾sion but no difference was observed after CIT. There
was also a significant increase in nitrosative stress af￾fected cells in kidney tissue over time in both groups.
Representative stainings are shown in Figure 2 and stat￾istical analysis is compiled in Table 2.
Laboratory parameters
Baseline laboratory findings in LD and BD animals were
not different, BD animals showed a significant increase
in white blood cells, creatinine, urea, sodium, ALT and
GGT 10 hours after induction of brain death. There were
no statistically significant differences in MPO and MDA
levels immediately prior to organ retrieval between LD and
BD (Table 3).
Discussion
Since donor organs are a limited resource, organs of differ￾ent quality have to be used. It is important to understand
factors that might impact negatively on organ and patient
survival. Oxidative stress as well as occurrence of apoptosis
and nitrosative stress induced cell damage in LD and BD
might be of interest in order to find new strategies to im￾prove transplantation outcome and patient long-term sur￾vival [30-32]. Most of recent studies [5] focus mainly on
pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expression during BD not
taking in consideration that oxidative as well as nitrosative
stress may play a major role in organ damage during BD.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate a panel of
genes encoding for protective mechanisms against oxida￾tive stress induced cell damage as well as pro- and anti￾apoptotic genes in BD and LD at different time points and
to document their influence on organ quality in terms of
occurrence of apoptosis mainly after CIT.

The significant pathophysiological alterations caused
by BD in a potential organ to be transplanted result in
inflammation and injury, which might affect graft func￾tion [9,30]. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding
of this process is mandatory to improve intervention
strategies [33]. After transplantation, IRI is clinically im￾portant because it can cause acute organ failure and high
patient mortality [34,35]. ROS and proinflammatory cy￾tokines which occur during BD as well as CIT play a key
role in the pathophysiology of IRI [35]. In order to suc￾cessfully target ROS, it is necessary to consider the spe￾cific ROS involved, the sources generating ROS in what
particular location, at what time in the pathogenesis,
and how much oxidative stress is generated. Additionally
it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by that ROS
are actually causing cell death and organ injury [36].
Under stress conditions such as BD, CIT as well as IRI,
mitochondrial dysfunction may occur what impacts on
detoxifying ROS in mitochondria or help repair minor
changes [36,37]. Different endogenous genes or gene
products have been identified as highly protective when
induced before and, in some cases after the start of is￾chemic injury. In general, these components are involved
in scavenging of ROS or detoxifying enzymes capable of
removing ROS [36]. Among others, GSS is well known
to detoxify hydrogen peroxide as well as peroxynitrate
by increasing intracellular glutathione levels [38,39]. Re￾cent studies examined the therapeutic potential of GSS,
a compound of particular clinical interest in humans
which is able to react spontaneously with nearly every
oxidants formed during inflammation and reperfusion
[40]. One of the first antioxidants investigated was the
use of exogenous catalases as well as SOD [41]. However,
administration of SOD resulted in only partial protection
due to its poor bioavailability. Up-regulation of SODs is
known to scavenge ROS and prevent the formation of
peroxynitrites [42,43].
In the course of this study, we found significantly ele￾vated SOD2 levels in liver tissue in BD after perfusion
and after CIT indicating that BD might induce protect￾ive effects in the liver prior to transplantation. Interest￾ingly we could not detect these changes in kidney tissue
of BD, but in kidneys of LD SOD2 as well as OXSR1
were significantly elevated. Taking in consideration the
better results of LD kidney transplantation compared to
BD kidney transplantation, the over-expression of these
genes might be one of the reasons for less IRI and DGF.
Another gene that protects cells against oxidative stress

induced cell damage is GPX3 [17,18]; however, in con￾trast in our study GPX3 was only over-expressed after
perfusion in LD livers, but not after CIT, suggesting that
this gene can be neglected in the pathophysiological
pathway of occurrence of apoptosis and graft survival in
a transplantation setting. OXSR1 is known to be in￾volved in cytoskeleton rearrangements and reacts on os￾motic stress and controls whether cells proliferate or die
by apoptosis [44]. Interestingly, OXSR1 levels were sig￾nificantly higher in LD compared to BD after CIT in
kidney tissue. However, in a LD setting, usually there is
less CIT and therefore, the protective effects of these
genes might not be as important as in a BD setting.
Other genes involved in organ protection belong to the
HSP 70 family which is capable of protecting cells from
lethal heat and other insults [45] and of preventing protein
aggregation and facilitates the refolding of denaturated
proteins. Up-regulating HSP 70 as a pre-conditioning strat￾egy has been shown to be cytoprotective in a number of
organs including the kidney and heart [5,46]. HSP 70 has
immune regulation properties with both pro- and anti￾inflammatory effects [47] and large clinical studies focusing
on cardiac ischemia have provided inconsistent reports of
protective [48,49] or detrimental effects [50] on the tissue.

Induction of HSP 70.2 increased survival and protected
against IRI in the liver [51] as well as in the kidney [5]. In
summary, the functions of HSP 70 are supposed to depend
on its location with intracellular HSP 70 attenuating in￾flammatory cascades, while HSP 70 released into the
extracellular matrix produces immune-regulatory effects
[52,53]. The results of our study showed significantly
higher levels of HSP 70.2 expression in heart tissue after
perfusion and CIT in BD whereas in kidney tissue there
was only a significant difference between prior to perfu￾sion and after CIT in LD organs and remained stable in
BD organs, indicating the protective effects of HSP 70.2
in the LD setting after CIT; these results are not in ac￾cordance with a recent study of van Dullemen et al. [5]
who showed enhanced expression of genes of the HSP
family in the kidney what might to be due to the fact
that they used a shorter period of BD as compared to
our study. However, they stated in their study that an
increase of HSP 70 expression appears to be insufficient
to counteract the detrimental effects of BD to the donor
kidney [5]; therefore, taking in consideration the results
of our study, the duration of BD especially in our large
animal model, might negatively impact on the expression
of genes of the HSP 70 family indicating that BD time
should be kept as short as possible prior to organ re￾trieval but pharmacological intervention enhancing HSP
expression prior to organ donation might be a valuable
procedure to increase organ quality of BD kidneys [5].
PPAR-alpha is crucial in lipid metabolism and regula￾tion of inflammation [15]. PPAR-alpha has been most
extensively studied in the regulation of genes involved in
glucose and lipid metabolism [54]. However, it is also
expressed by macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells, endo￾thelial cells and other cell types, that impact on inflam￾mation and immunity [55-57]. PPAR-alpha ligands are
known to inhibit interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis
factor alpha and interferon-gamma production by acti￾vated T-cells [58] and therefore might be involved in
acute rejection [15]. In our study PPAR-alpha levels did
not change significantly in any organ investigated over
time.
If the protective mechanisms described above are al￾tered, apoptosis may occur, leading to graft dysfunction
and patient mortality. Therefore we additionally investi￾gated pro-apoptotic BAX [8] and anti-apoptotic genes
like BCL2L1 [9] or NFKB [7] which is known to play a
key role in initiation of inflammation and rejection as
well as occurrence of apoptosis in organ transplantation
[10]. The ratio between BAX and BCL2L1 gene expres￾sion, both mitochondria-associated proteins defines the
susceptibility of cells towards apoptotic stimuli [11].
BCL2L1 was significantly higher after 4 hours of CIT in
heart tissue of BD donors. BCL2L1 levels of LD was sig￾nificantly higher at all time points observed in kidney
tissue whereas no significant changes could be found in
BCL2L1 levels in liver tissue in between LD and BD over
the whole observation period. This indicates through the
up-regulation of this anti-apoptotic gene that BD seems
to have protective effects in terms of inactivation of the
apoptotic pathway in heart tissue, whereas no influence
could be detected in BD liver tissue. The same results
were found for the pro-apoptotic gene BAX that was
up-regulated after CIT in heart tissue of BD but not in
liver as well as kidney tissue. Similar results were ob￾served for NFKB which, however, was not up-regulated
after CIT in heart tissue as well as at all time points ob￾served in liver tissue regarding BD. The balance between
the anti-apoptotic gene expression and the pro-apoptotic
gene expression in these cases might be caused by the up￾regulation of genes protecting from oxidative stress in￾duced cell damage as mentioned above. These findings are
not in accordance with a study of Van der Hoeven et al. [6]
who showed that mRNA levels of several anti-apoptotic
proteins were up-regulated in BD rat livers including the
BCL2 family; However, the main difference in between
these two studies is, that in our study, we used a large ani￾mal model and a longer period of BD. Moreover, our study
focused more detailed on the expression of oxidative stress
induced gene expression and therefore these two studies
seem not to be adequately comparable but when being
taken together might help to get better insights in the
pathophysiological pathways occurring during BD what
poses the possibility to design new studies in order to find
strategies to improve organ quality after BD and conse￾quently improve transplantation outcome. Interestingly,
NFKB was up-regulated in LD kidney tissue after CIT. In
order to confirm the results from the panel of genes we in￾vestigated, immunohistochemical staining for apoptotic
and nitrosative stress induced cell damage were performed
to show that the cascades mentioned above helped to pre￾vent cell damage or not.
For histological evaluation of apoptotic cell death, an
antibody against activated Caspase 3 was chosen in this
study due to its reliability and because it is involved in
the final execution phase of apoptosis [59]. Due to the
fact that in our laboratory immunohistochemistry for ac￾tivated Caspase 3 is well established and this staining
method is recommended for detection of the onset of
the irreversible pathway of apoptosis we decided to use
this staining method in this study [60]. In all organs in￾vestigated in this study we found elevated levels of acti￾vated Caspase 3 positive cells in BD as compared to LD,
especially in the liver being significantly elevated even
prior to organ retrieval indicating that BD induces apop￾totic cell death due to the hemodynamic instability in￾cluding short hypertensive phases at the onset of BD
followed by a decline of blood pressure to normal tension
or hypotension, what could cause poor organ perfusion
Stiegler et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2013, 11:244 Page 9 of 12
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/11/1/244

and thereby inadequate oxygen supply despite of intensive
donor care during 10 hours of BD. In all other organs, we
could observe a significant increase in apoptotic cells after
the different CIT. In liver and kidney tissue apoptotic cell
death was less pronounced in LD compared to BD organs
after CIT, whereas in heart tissue no such difference was
found. We are aware of the fact that LD of heart is only a
hypothetical scenario, but from our point of view these
control organs taken from LD helped to get better insights
in the pathophysiological cascades during BD and CIT
impacting on organ quality and graft survival. These find￾ings indicate that although organs from BD donors do not
show more apoptosis before and after perfusion, organs
from BD animals seem to be more vulnerable to CIT. This
is interesting due to the fact that from this point of view,
the donor source does not seem to influence the organ
quality in terms of apoptotic cells, but CIT. These findings
are in accordance with findings of another study of our
group where we could show that the levels of high energy
phosphates as an indicator of organ quality are independ￾ent of the donor type but dependent on CIT [22].
The second marker, which was chosen for immunohisto￾chemical evaluation of LD and BD tissue was nitrotyrosine,
a specific marker for nitrosative stress [61] which is known
to negatively influence organ function. Except for heart
tissue we found significantly different amounts of nitro￾tyrosine positive cells after BD at the time prior to organ
retrieval indicating that BD induces nitrosative stress
mainly supposed through less oxygen supply due to
hemodynamic disturbances caused by the “autonomic
storm” induced by BD. Nitrosative stress seems to be the
highest in liver tissue of BD as compared to LD. How￾ever, CIT did not significantly influence nitrotyrosine ex￾pression in kidney tissue whereas in heart and liver tissue
there was also a significant elevation of nitrotyrosine
positive cells when comparing LD and BD. Esposito et al.
recently reported to reduce nitrosative stress in IRI
after organ transplantation by administration of glutam￾ine [61] what seems to be a promising method to re￾duce nitrosative stress induced cell damage as well as
lipidperoxidation when regarding the results of our
study, especially in BD organs when a certain CIT has
to be considered. In kidney and liver tissue of BD or￾gans, activated Caspase 3 as well as nitrotyrosine posi￾tive cells were mainly found next to blood vessels,
indicating the vulnerability of the vascular endothelium
to oxidative and nitrosative stress. In kidney tissue, es￾pecially tubular tissue seemed to be more susceptible to
occurrence of apoptosis after CIT.
Among other processes occurring during BD, activated
neutrophils secrete enzymes such as MPO and liberate
more ROS [62]. MPO is known as an inflammation
marker. However, we did not observe significant differ￾ences in MPO concentrations in the serum of LD and
BD pigs indicating that in our study, the MPO concen￾trations were not elevated through the induction of BD
and therefore we can exclude its negative impact on
organ quality in the LD and BD setting of our study.
Moreover, ROS may lead to severe injury to the cell
membrane by lipid peroxidation which may generate
reactive carbonyl compounds such as MDA the most
abundant aldehyde resulting from lipid peroxidation
[63,64]. However, we could not detect any differences in
MDA concentrations in the serum of LD and BD pigs.
Conclusion
The results of this study are consistent and show that
pro-apoptotic genes as well as genes supposed to be pro￾tective in terms of reduction of oxidative stress induced
cell damage are differentially regulated during BD com￾pared to LD depending on the type of organ. Low levels
of oxidative stress are postulated to be responsible for
pre-conditioning effects such as elevation of GSS, SOD
as well as HSP 70.2 levels [65]. Despite the up-regulation
of these protective genes, at the end of CIT, all BD organs
showed significantly more apoptotic cells as compared
to LD. However, it can be speculated that, if the pre￾conditioning of the organs during BD would be missing,
the final outcome after CIT would even be more detri￾mental, due to the lack of the protective effects of the
panel of genes analyzed. The pathophysiological path￾ways finally resulting in more apoptotic and nitrotyrosine
positive cells after CIT in BD seem to be different de￾pendent on the type of organ. One limitation of this
study is that it was not performed in a human setting,
but since a study like this would not be possible using
human donor organs, a large reproducible animal model
is the best alternative. To our knowledge this is the first
large animal study focusing on this panel of genes in a
BD as well as LD setting comparing these results with
immunohistochemistry. We are convinced that we could
gain more detailed insights in the pathophysiological
pathways occurring during BD and, moreover, during
CIT focusing on the different types of organs. Fur￾ther studies will be necessary to show the detailed ef￾fects of different substances, which might be used for
donor pre-conditioning in BD helping to improve trans￾plantation outcome.
