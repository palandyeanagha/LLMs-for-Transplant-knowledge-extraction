Aspergillus ustus is a mold that rarely infects humans;
only 15 systemic cases have been reported. We report the
first outbreak of invasive infection caused by A. ustus
among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipi￾ents. Six patients with infections were identified; 3 infec￾tions each occurred in both 2001 and 2003. Molecular
typing by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA
(RAPD) and antifungal drug susceptibility testing were per￾formed on clinical and environmental isolates recovered
from our hospital from 1999 to 2003. The highest overall
attack rate in HSCT patients was 1.6%. The overall death
rate was 50%, and death occurred within 8 days after diag￾nostic culture collection. Clinical isolates exhibited
decreased susceptibility to antifungal drugs, especially
azoles. RAPD and phylogenetic analysis showed genetic
similarity between isolates from different patients. Based on
the clustering of cases in space and time and molecular
data, common-source acquisition of this unusual drug￾resistant species is possible. 
I
nvasive aspergillosis (IA) has become a devastating
opportunistic fungal infection among immunocompro￾mised hosts, with a 357% increase in death rates reported
in the United States from 1980 to 1997 (1). The most com￾mon cause of IA is Aspergillus fumigatus (2). However, in
recent years, IA has been increasingly caused by non-fumi￾gatus Aspergillus species. For example, at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, the propor￾tion of infections caused by non-fumigatus Aspergillus
species increased during the latter 1990s. Most of these
infections were caused by A. flavus, A. nidulans, A. ter￾reus, and A. niger (3).
Aspergillus ustus is a group of filamentous hyalohy￾phomycetes consisting of 5 species: A. ustus, A. puniceus,
A. panamensis, A. conjunctus, and A. deflectus. Members
of this group are rare human pathogens; only 15 cases of
systemic infection have been reported in the literature
since 1970, and more than half of these occurred in the past
10 years (online Appendix Table, available at http://www.
cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-0670.htm#table_app)
(4−17). Infections caused by A. ustus may be of particular
concern, as the organisms exhibit low susceptibility to
multiple antifungal drugs, and outcomes have been uni￾formly poor (Appendix Table). Recognition of invasive
infections that occurred in 2 clusters of hematopoietic stem
cell transplant (HSCT) recipients in our institution prompt￾ed us to perform a more thorough clinical investigation and
environmental sampling to identify potential sources of
acquisition.
Methods
Case Identification and Environmental Surveillance
Recognition of time-clustered cases in 2003 prompted
us to do this retrospective study and epidemiologic inves￾tigation. Cases of infection caused by A. ustus were identi￾fied by review of microbiology and infection control
records available from 1993 to 2003. Charts were
reviewed for clinical data (demographics, underlying dis￾ease, transplantation characteristics, antifungal therapies,
radiographic and laboratory studies, and outcome). Cases
were classified as proven, probable, or possible according
to consensus criteria published by the European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/
Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Mycoses Study Group (18). The Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center institutional review board approved this
study.
The hospital is a large tertiary care facility that houses
patients with HSCT on the top 2 floors (the northeast
wings of the seventh and eighth floors). A spot map depict￾ing case-patient location and timeline relating location to

time of diagnosis was created. Information on timing of
construction activities and airflow information was
obtained from hospital engineering and infection control
personnel. An attack rate was estimated among the poten￾tially exposed HSCT patients using as the denominator the
number of patients who were admitted for HSCT from July
through October 2001 and March through September
2003, the at-risk periods when cases occurred.
Environmental Sampling 
Based on the spot map, environmental air sampling of
patient hospital rooms was performed, and environmental
isolates were obtained. An air particle sampler (SAS Super
100, PBI International, Milan, Italy) was used to collect
ambient “dust” to the 0.3-µm size. Samples (0.5 m3) were
cultured on inhibitory mold agar plates (Remel IMA
plates, Lenexa, KS, USA). Organisms were identified to
the species level by using standard morphologic criteria for
A. ustus. Isolates were stored at −70°C. 
Molecular Typing 
Molecular typing of A. ustus clinical and environmen￾tal isolates was performed by randomly amplified poly￾morphic DNA (RAPD) analysis by using A. ustus ATCC
1041, NRRL 275, and Candida parapsilosis for outgroup
comparison (19). DNA templates were purified from ≈50
mg cells, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
treated with Lyticase 10 µg/mL (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h at 37°C, and then digested with
Proteinase K 10 µg/mL (Sigma Chemical Co.). Mixtures
were subjected to 3 cycles of freeze-thaw in liquid nitro￾gen, alternating with vortexing with 0.2 g glass beads.
Genomic DNA was isolated with the DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufactur￾er’s instructions. The RAPD reactions were run under con￾ditions optimized for each primer (Table 1) by using a
PerkinElmer 9700 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer, Cetus, CT,
USA). PCR products underwent electrophoresis in 1.8%
agarose gels, were stained with ethidium bromide, and
images were obtained by using an Alpha Imager (Alpha
Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA, USA). Only
bands that possessed one-tenth the integrated intensity of
the 1,650-bp band of the molecular marker (4 ng) (area
under the curve [AUC] = 1,132) were defined as positive
bands for subsequent band relational analysis. The band
patterns from each gel with each primer were analyzed by
using tools for population genetics analysis (TFPGA)
(unpub. data). Cluster analysis was performed by the
unweighted pair group mean with arithmetic average
(UPGMA) method (20). Bootstrapping was performed
with 1,000 tree comparisons with averages by using
TFPGA. Band patterns of >95% similarity were classified
as identical.
Antifungal Drug Susceptibility Testing 
Antifungal drug susceptibility testing of A. ustus iso￾lates was performed by using a microbroth dilution assay,
as described by the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards or the filamentous fungi (M38-A)
for itraconazole (Janssen, Titusville, NJ, USA), voricona￾zole (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA), and amphotericin B
(Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Princeton, NJ, USA) (21).
Susceptibility (minimal effective concentration) to caspo￾fungin (Merck Research Laboratories, Rahway, NJ, USA)
was determined by using a microbroth dilution assay in
antibiotic 3 (AM3) media, as described previously (22). 
Results
Outbreak Cases
We identified 2 clusters of A. ustus infection among
HSCT recipients in our hospital during the study. The first
occurred from July to October 2001 (3 probable lung
infections: patients 1, 2, and 3). The second occurred from
March to September 2003 (1 proven skin infection [likely
disseminated from lung] and 2 probable lung infections:
patients 4, 5, and 6) (Appendix Table); 1 lung transplant
recipient was colonized with A. ustus while in the hospital
(data not shown).
The median age of patients was 59 (range 29−63) years;
5 (83.3%) were male; median neutropenia duration 15
(range 4−22) days; 5 (83.3%) patients had graft-versus￾host disease that required therapy; 5 (83.3%) patients had
received mold-active antifungal drugs prophylactically
(itraconazole, n = 4) or for a prior diagnosis (voriconazole,
n = 1). The median time of diagnosis after transplantation
RESEARCH
404 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 12, No. 3, March 2006

was 222 (range 60−1,295) days (n = 5). Three (50%) of the
6 patients died, all within 8 days of diagnostic culture col￾lection.
Epidemiologic Investigation
Estimating that 382 patients were admitted for HSCT
during the at-risk period, the highest overall attack rate
was 1.6%, which is above the baseline rate of infection
with A. ustus at our institution (0%). No changes in labo￾ratory processing or mold identification methods occurred
during the study. Of note, construction of a new surgery
pavilion occurred outside our hospital building beginning
in July 2001 and ending in December 2003. Airflow to
hospital rooms in which the patients resided passed
through multiple filters (blanket filter, pre-filter, 95% fil￾ter, HEPA filter).
The spot map and time line showed that cases clustered
mainly along 2 corridors on 2 floors, 1 directly above the
other, around the time of diagnosis. In the 2001 and 2003
outbreaks, all case-patients resided in the same or adjacent
rooms before diagnosis (Figure 1).
Environmental air sampling performed 2 months after
the last case occurred in 2003 found no A. ustus isolates in
the rooms of HSCT patients. One environmental A. ustus
isolate was obtained from the carpeted floor of the hall
near the room in which the colonized lung transplant recip￾ient resided. The same bronchoscope was used to evaluate
each patient; however, it was cleaned after each examina￾tion. Also, several patients who were not found to have A.
ustus on bronchoalveolar lavage underwent bronchoscopic
examination before case-patients, suggesting that cross￾contamination was unlikely. 
Analyses of Isolates
Eleven A. ustus isolates were available for analysis.
One patient (patient 3) did not have a viable isolate stored,
and 1 patient (patient 5) had 3 isolates recovered during
the course of infection. A total of 73 bands were resolved
from the 11 A. ustus isolates (Figure 2). The isolates
recovered from the 5 HSCT were genetically similar.
Three isolates from patient 5 were genetically most simi￾lar to the isolate from patient 2. At the time of his diagno￾sis and death, patient 2 resided in a room directly adjacent
to and above the room of patient 5, albeit 2 years earlier
(Figure 1). Similarly, the isolate from patient 1 was genet￾ically most similar to that of patient 4; patients 1 and 4
resided in adjacent rooms, also separated by a period of 2
years. Of note, the lung transplant patient appeared to be
colonized with a strain of A. ustus that was genetically as
distant from the patient isolates as the wild-type ATCC
strain. Antifungal drug susceptibility testing of clinical
isolates demonstrated relatively high MICs to all antifun￾gal drugs tested (Table 2). 
Discussion
We report the first outbreak of disease caused by an
unusual fungal pathogen, A. ustus, a mold that has rarely
caused invasive disease in humans. This observation is

important, given the possibility of common-source acqui￾sition of a potentially antifungal drug–resistant organism. 
All members of the A. ustus complex have similar
shape with subtle differences. Macroscopically, the
colonies appear drab olive to dull brown or gray and wool￾ly with occasional dark purple or yellow exudates.
Microscopically, the conidia are large (3.0–4.5 µm) and
are rough-walled. Elongate and irregular-shaped Hülle
cells that are resistant to desiccation may also be produced
(23). A. ustus is toxigenic and produced several mycotox￾ins such as austdiol, austin, austocystin A, and sterigmato￾cystin (24–27). Although these toxins may be medically
important, the quantities of toxin produced in the environ￾ment may not be significant (28,29). The spectrum of dis￾ease reported due to A. ustus includes onychomycosis,
otitis media, primary cutaneous infection, endocarditis,
pneumonia, and disseminated infection, the latter cases
occurring largely among immunocompromised hosts such
as HSCT recipients. All previously reported cases occurred
sporadically in diverse medical centers (Appendix Table).
Many reported cases have been either primary cutaneous
disease or disseminated infection, however, we cannot
draw firm conclusions regarding the types of infections
this organism causes because of the high likelihood of
reporting bias. The relative pathogenicity of this
Aspergillus species has not been well studied. 
In the 6 HSCT patients described in this article, infec￾tion developed late after HSCT, with a high proportion of
deaths (30,31). These patients also possessed classic risk
factors for IA in that most had graft-versus-host disease
that required corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive
therapy (30). Overall death rates of patients with A. ustus
infection was high in this cohort, as in previous cases (4−
15). Whether death was attributable to the fungal infection,
coinfections, or underlying diseases is unclear. 
A common source for the A. ustus infections appears
possible, since case-patients clustered in space and time,
and a high degree of genetic similarity was noted between
isolates from case-patients. Since these patients resided in
rooms within close proximity, common source acquisition
(e.g., air, water, or surface) is credible. Common source
acquisition may not be precluded by case isolate separation
in time as Aspergillus conidia are resistant to harsh condi￾tions, surviving in the environment for many years in dor￾mant phase (32). However, the environmental niche of this
fungus is not known. Patients were in and out of the hos￾pital after transplantation, so infection could have been
acquired in the environment. We also cannot rule out the
possibility that other clinical factors (e.g., changes in hosts
or antifungal drug administration) selected for specific A.
ustus isolates in the patients. 
The results of molecular analyses suggest genetic simi￾larity of isolates recovered from patients. Although dis￾criminatory power of RAPD analyses has some limitations
(33), the composite analysis demonstrated large separa￾tions between patient isolates and the control ATCC strain.
Our study is limited by the lack of local environmental A.
ustus isolates available for genetic comparison. Although
the clinical isolates appear different from the ATCC strain,
the genetic similarity of case strains may represent a strain
common to our local environment. Also, these analyses are
limited by our lack of knowledge concerning A. ustus’s
modes of reproduction. Specifically, genomic rearrange￾ment with recombination, which has been postulated to
occur in several species of Aspergillus, may increase the
variation observed between related strains (34).

Figure 2. Molecular typing of Aspergillus ustus isolates by using random amplification of polymorphic DNA. The isolate from patient 3
was not viable on subculturing and, as such, was not available for molecular analysis. Gel images (A) and composite dendrogram (B)
are shown.

Our investigation was limited by constraints in con￾ducting retrospective analyses. More timely environmental
sampling may have captured more environmental A. ustus
isolates (32,35). For example, swabbing of dust-ridden
surfaces may have indicated the underlying air quality in
terms of fungal spores in the preceding months when
infection may have occurred. In the absence of substantial
air disturbances, A. ustus spores would be more likely to
quickly settle in such areas, given their large size and rela￾tively decreased buoyancy. Construction, a well-known
environmental risk factor for IA (36), was ongoing outside
the hospital during the time of these outbreaks. We cannot
comment on the role of water as a source of infection,
which has been reported in multiple hospitals (32,35).
Determining the source of infection is further complicated
in that a combination of inoculum effect and underlying
host immunosuppression make calculating the incubation
period problematic. Thus, the source of A. ustus infection
among our patients, and whether the infections were noso￾comial or community acquired, remains unknown. 
These outbreaks of A. ustus infections may be of infec￾tion control importance, as the clinical isolates exhibited
low susceptibilities to multiple antifungal drugs, as was
reported previously (12,17). Although we do not know
breakpoints of A. fumigatus resistance, results of prior
studies suggest that infection with organisms requiring
high MICs of amphotericin or itraconazole is associated
with poor clinical outcomes (37,38). Most of our patients
received mold-active azole drugs before diagnosis as
either prophylaxis or therapy for a previous infection with
A. fumigatus. Similarly, A. ustus was recently reported to
cause “breakthrough” infection during administration of
voriconazole and caspofungin (17). Drug exposure may
select for colonization or infection with resistant isolates or
facilitate acquired resistance within a colonizing strain.
The latter may occur in A. fumigatus isolates exposed to
azole antifungal agents (39,40). In this cohort, several
patients who received the combination regimen of
voriconazole and caspofungin had A. ustus infection
resolve; whether this resolution was due to drug synergy in
treating relatively resistant organisms is worthy of further
consideration. 
A. ustus is rare; however, it may be emerging as a cause
of systemic disease among immunocompromised hosts in
the appropriate setting. A combination of factors, including
severity of underlying host immunosuppression and com￾mon source acquisition, likely played a role in the report￾ed outbreaks. Active laboratory, environmental, and
clinical-based surveillance for A. ustus has been imple￾mented at our hospital based on the results of this investi￾gation; no additional isolates have been identified
subsequently. Such intensive monitoring may show similar
outbreaks in other facilities. This study also emphasizes
the importance of establishing microbial diagnoses to the
species level; information obtained is important for infec￾tion control and, possibly, to guide antifungal therapies.
More studies will be necessary to determine the clinical
consequence of antifungal resistance in A. ustus isolates.
