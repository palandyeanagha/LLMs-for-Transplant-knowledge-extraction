Abstract
It has been reported that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can transfer mitochondria to the cells with severely
compromised mitochondrial function. We tested whether the reported intercellular mitochondrial transfer could be
replicated in different types of cells or under different experimental conditions, and tried to elucidate possible mechanism.
Using biochemical selection methods, we found exponentially growing cells in restrictive media (uridine2 and
bromodeoxyuridine [BrdU]+
) during the coculture of MSCs (uridine-independent and BrdU-sensitive) and 143B-derived
cells with severe mitochondrial dysfunction induced by either long-term ethidium bromide treatment or short-term
rhodamine 6G (R6G) treatment (uridine-dependent but BrdU-resistant). The exponentially growing cells had nuclear DNA
fingerprint patterns identical to 143B, and a sequence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) identical to the MSCs. Since R6G
causes rapid and irreversible damage to mitochondria without the removal of mtDNA, the mitochondrial function appears
to be restored through a direct transfer of mitochondria rather than mtDNA alone. Conditioned media, which were
prepared by treating mtDNA-less 143B r0 cells under uridine-free condition, induced increased chemotaxis in MSC, which
was also supported by transcriptome analysis. Cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of chemotaxis and cytoskeletal assembly, blocked
mitochondrial transfer phenomenon in the above condition. However, we could not find any evidence of mitochondrial
transfer to the cells harboring human pathogenic mtDNA mutations (A3243G mutation or 4,977 bp deletion). Thus, the
mitochondrial transfer is limited to the condition of a near total absence of mitochondrial function. Elucidation of the
mechanism of mitochondrial transfer will help us create a potential cell therapy-based mitochondrial restoration or
mitochondrial gene therapy for human diseases caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.

Introduction
In the 1940s, Lederberg and Tatum discovered the conjugation
phenomenon, which is a process of a unidirectional transfer of
genetic information essential for survival on a minimal medium
through the formation of a physical bridge between a donor
bacterium and a recipient bacterium [1]. Similar to the earlier
findings in prokaryotes, it was recently reported that human
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can transfer mitochondria
(microorganelles containing their own genetic information) to the
cells with nonfunctional mitochondria incapable of aerobic
respiration due to defective or deleted mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) [2]. However, the mechanism of intercellular mitochon￾drial transfer is still elusive. It was postulated that the MSC actively
transfers mitochondria to the cells with severely compromised
mitochondrial function through a tunneling, tube-like structure
[2]. In addition, it is conceivable that the cells with defective
mitochondrial function could uptake the vesicles containing
mitochondria that budded off from the donor cells. However,
isolated mitochondria or platelets, which contain mitochondria,
could not restore mitochondrial function of the cells with
nonfunctional mitochondria [2]. Furthermore, it is uncertain
whether the restoration of mitochondrial function is mediated by
the transfer of mtDNA alone, which is similar to the conjugation
phenomenon, or by the transfer of intact mitochondrial particles.
In this study, firstly, we investigated whether the reported
intercellular mitochondrial transfer [2] could be replicated in
different types of cells or under different experimental conditions.
In this regard, we used mtDNA-less r0 cells derived from human
osteosarcoma 143B cells lacking thymidine kinase activity by long￾term treatment with ethidium bromide (EtBr) [3]. Secondly, to
address whether the restoration of mitochondrial function is
mediated through a transfer of mtDNA alone or intact
mitochondrial particles, we used rhodamine-6G (R6G), which
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e32778

causes abrupt and irreversible damage to the mitochondrial
function without the removal of mtDNA [4,5,6,7]. Finally, to
explore the possibility of therapeutic implications, we examined
whether the mitochondrial transfer could occur in the cells
harboring mtDNA mutations relevant to human diseases, such as
A to G substitution at np 3243 in tRNAleu(UUR) (OMIM #540000
or #520000) and 4,977 bp large deletion (OMIM #530000).
Materials and Methods
Coculture experiments
The 143B r+ cell and the 143B r0 cell, which was established
from the 143B r+ cell through long-term treatment with EtBr,
were generous gifts from Professor Yau-Huei Wei from National
Yang-Ming University in Taiwan. Since the 143B r0 cell is
characterized by the absence of a functional respiratory chain, no
thymidine kinase activity, and dependence on uridine and
pyruvate [3], we grew the cells in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Media (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with
100 mg/ml BrdU (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 50 mg/ml uridine
(Sigma), and 10% FBS. Southern blot analysis and PCR
amplification of mtDNA target sequences confirmed the absence
of any residual mtDNA (data not shown). Trans-mitochondrial
cytoplasmic hybrids (or cybrids) harboring either the A3243G or
4,977 bp deletion mutation with varying degrees of mutational
load (heteroplasmy rate) that shared an identical nuclear
background with 143B, were also cultured in the same media.
The cybrids with A3243G mutation were derived by fusion of
143B r0 cells with platelets from a patient harboring A3243G
mutation, according to the standard protocol [8]. The cybrids with
4,977 bp deletion mutation were also gifts from Professor Wei.
The schemes of the coculture procedures are shown in Fig. 1.
We cocultured human bone marrow derived MSCs at 1.56105
cells with those cells listed above (i.e., 143B r0
, cybrids with
A3243G, and cybrids with 4,977 bp deletion) at 36105 cells in a
100 mm culture dish with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
and 50 mg/ml uridine for 24 h. At this stage, we removed BrdU
from the culture medium; we did not add pyruvate, since DMEM
contains a sufficient amount of pyruvate (110 mg/ml). Then, we
changed the culture medium with DMEM supplemented by 10%
FBS, but without uridine (Stage I). After five days of coculture in
the DMEM without uridine, we added 100 mg/ml BrdU to the
same culture condition and continued cultivation for several weeks
(Stage II). These experiments were repeated by adding cytocha￾lasin B (5 mg/ml) (Sigma), an inhibitor of chemotaxis and
cytoskeletal assembly.
For the quick removal of mitochondrial function, we treated
143B r+ cells with rhodamine 6G (R6G, Invitrogen) at 1 mg/ml
for 48 h. After 48 h of treatment with 1 mg/ml of R6G, the 143B
r+ cells could not survive in the restrictive media lacking uridine.
To examine whether mtDNAs were removed after R6G
treatment, we performed PCR analysis with genomic DNA
extracted from the 143B r+ cells before and 5 days after R6G
treatment. PCR amplification was performed using primers, 59-
CCACAACTCAACGGCTACAT-39 (10131–10350) and 59-
CTGTGGGTGGTTGTGTTGAT-39 (10851–10832). The PCR
product (721 bp) was examined on 1.5% agarose gel. Using these
R6G-treated cells, we repeated the above coculture procedures
(Stage I and II) after careful washing with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS).
Nuclear DNA fingerprinting and mtDNA genotyping
Nuclear DNA fingerprinting was performed by using short
tandem repeat (STR) loci in the AmpF/STR IdentifilerTM PCR
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA), as described previously [9].
We performed direct sequencing of mtDNA hypervariable regions
(HVRs) using primers (L15751-H16439 for HVR I and L048-
H922 for HVR II and HVR III) as described previously [10].
We also performed a PCR restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) analysis for mtDNA polymorphisms. In
this experiment, we used cybrid cells harboring mtDNA
characterized by absence of both 10394 Dde I and 10397 Alu I
sites, since the MSC used in this study had +10394 Dde I
(A10398G variant) and +10397 Alu I (C10400T variant) sites. PCR
amplification was performed using primers, 59-CCACAACT￾CAACGGCTACAT-39 (10131–10350) and 59-CTGTGGGTG￾GTTGTGTTGAT-39 (10851–10832). The PCR product (721 bp)
was digested with Dde I and Alu I and the RFLP pattern was
examined on 1.5% agarose gel.
Measurement of intracellular ATP content
The cellular contents of ATP were measured using the luciferin￾luciferase reaction with an ATP bioluminescence somatic cell
assay kit (Sigma). The harvested cells, which were grown in culture
media (DMEM with 10% FBS) containing uridine but not BrdU,
were suspended with KRH buffer containing 0.1 mM glucose and
0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). These cell suspensions were
incubated in a 37uC shaking water bath. Following the addition of
an assay mixture containing luciferin and luciferase, luminescence
was measured immediately in a bioluminometer equipped with an
injector (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The
amounts of ATP were determined by running an internal
standard, and they were adjusted for the amount of protein that
was determined via the Bradford method.
Measurement of oxygen consumption
Oxygen consumption was measured with a respirometer
(Oxygraph-2k; Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). Stan￾dardized instrumental and chemical calibrations were performed
to correct back-diffusion of Oxygen into the chamber from the
various components. The suspension of cells in culture media
(DMEM with 10% FBS) containing uridine but not BrdU was
added to the respirometer with a concentration of 1.06106 cells/
ml. The respirometer was operated at 37uC with a 2 ml volume.
Oxygen flux was analyzed by the software provided by the
manufacturer, which is capable of converting nonlinear changes in
the negative time derivative of the oxygen concentration signal.
Cell migration assay
The QCMTM 24-Well Colorimetric Cell Migration Assay kit
(Chemicon, Temecula, CA), which has an 8-mm pore size
polycarbonate membrane and is based on the Boyden chamber
principle, was used for this experiment. The assay provides
quantitative or colorimetric information on the amount of the
cells, which migrated from the upper chamber to the lower
chamber across the microporous membrane. Briefly, MSCs were
prepared at 1.06106 cells/ml after 24 h treatment of serum-free
DMEM. We added 500 ml of serum-free DMEM containing
MSCs to the upper chamber in the presence of conditioned
medium, which was prepared by treating 143B r0 cells, when the
cells reached 60% confluence in 100 mm culture dish, with 10 ml
of standard or uridine-free media for 48 h, in the lower chamber.
Serum-free fresh DMEM was used as control. MSCs that had
migrated through the polycarbonate membrane were incubated
with cell-staining solution and were subsequently extracted and
detected on a standard microplate reader at 560 nm according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Electron microscope (EM)
Cultured cells were sequentially fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
and 1% OsO4. Thereafter we followed the standard procedures
for EM examination. For the scanning EM, the samples were
mounted on aluminum stubs with conductive paste, coated with a
20–30 nm thickness of platinum in an ion coater (Eiko IB-3, Eiko
Engineering, Ibataki, Japan), and viewed in a scanning EM (S-520;
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). For transmission EM examination, heavy
metal staining was done with 4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate,
and the samples were examined through H-7100 EM (Hitachi) at
50 kV.
Microarray
Gene expression profiles of MSCs at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after
treatment with conditioned media, which were obtained by
treating 143B r0 cells with uridine-free media for 48 h.
Microarray experiments were performed using GeneChipH
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For normalization,
the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) was applied, which was
implemented in BioConductor in the R statistical language [11].
All data is MIAME compliant and the raw data has been
deposited in GEO (accession number: GSE33831).
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as means 6 SD. Statistical significance was
evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and p,0.05 was
considered significant. For differential expression analysis, we used
Bayes-ANOVA by Baldi et al. [12], which identifies genes whose
expression levels differ between time points. In comparison to
standard ANOVA, Bayes-ANOVA is more stable—especially with
a small number of replicates—because it uses the posterior
variance, which integrates data variance from a specific gene and
prior variance from the neighboring genes in the Bayesian
framework [12]. For multiple hypothesis testing correction, we
used the Benjamini and Hochberg method to obtain the false
discovery rate. For a cluster analysis of gene expression profiles, we
used the self-organizing map (SOM) method implemented in
BioConductor in the R statistical language. To visualize the global
relationship of individual clusters, we performed a BioLattice
analysis [13] with the clusters created by SOM. BioLattice enables
a better biological interpretation of microarray gene expression
data by organizing clusters into a unified lattice of concepts.
Results
Coculture of MSC with cells lacking mitochondrial
function
The mtDNA-less 143B r0 cells have neither an electron transfer
chain function nor thymidine kinase activity. Therefore, they are
characterized by uridine dependence and BrdU resistance [3]. In
contrast, MSCs from human bone marrow have normal
mitochondrial function and thymidine kinase activity, and they
are both uridine-independent and BrdU-sensitive. Firstly, we
confirmed the difference in uridine dependence and BrdU
sensitivity between 143B r0 and bone marrow-derived MSCs.
As we expected, MSCs survived in uridine-free media but were
sensitive to BrdU (Fig. 2 A–C), whereas 143B r0 cells could not
survive in uridine-free media and were resistant to BrdU (Fig. 2 D–
F). The scheme of the coculture procedures is shown in Fig. 1. The
143B r0 cells were cocultured with MSCs in permissive media
with uridine supplementation for one day and then in restrictive
media lacking uridine for five days (Stage I). After three days of
coculture in restrictive media, most of the epithelial-like 143B r0
cells died, while fibroblast-like MSCs remained unaffected. After
five days of coculture in restrictive media, we added BrdU to the
media (Stage II). Thereafter, fibroblast-like MSCs could not
proliferate and gradually died with a senescent appearance (Fig. 2
G). After 7,10 days in the uridine2 BrdU+ media, we observed
multiple foci of colonizing cells, each of which had a distinct
epithelial-like morphology of 143B cells on microscopic examina￾tion (Fig. 2 H); they also grew exponentially to the confluence
(Fig. 2 I).
The 143B r+ cells (parental cells of r0
) treated with 1 mg/ml
R6G for 48 h could not survive in the restrictive media without
uridine supplementation (data not shown). However, mtDNA was
Figure 1. Scheme of coculture experiments. Mitochondrial dysfunction was induced by long-term treatment of ethidium bromide (EtBr), which
is known to remove mtDNA while sparing nuclear DNA, or by short-term treatment of rhodamine 6G (R6G), which tightly binds to the mitochondrial
inner membrane and destroys the mitochondrial respiratory function. Gel image shows that the mtDNA was still present until five days after R6G
treatment (inset). We cocultured MSCs with 143B-derived cells with severely compromised mitochondrial function (Dmt) in uridine2 BrdU2 media for
five days (Stage I) and in uridine2 BrdU+ media thereafter (Stage II). Cybrid cells harboring either the A3243G or 4,977 bp deletion mutation were also
cultured in a similar way, with slight modification. For details, refer to the Materials and Methods section. The gray-colored box refers to the condition,
which was expected to be fatal for the cells.

still detected by PCR (shown as inset in Fig. 1). We added MSCs to
the R6G-treated 143B r+ cells and repeated the experimental
procedures in the same manner as was done for the 143B r0 cells.
After 7,10 days in the uridine2 BrdU+ media, we also found
multiple foci of exponentially colonizing cells with epithelial-like
morphology (data not shown). The addition of cytochalasin B, an
inhibitor of chemotaxis and cytoskeletal assembly, yielded no
exponentially growing colonies in coculture experiments using
either 143B r0 or R6G-treated 143B r+ cells (data not shown).
Genetic analysis of recuperated cells
Normally, none of 143B r0
, R6G-treated 143B r+
, or MSC
could survive in uridine2 BrdU+ media; therefore, the exponen￾tially growing cells in uridine2 BrdU+ media must be the cells with
normal mitochondrial function but with no thymidine kinase
activity—characters that could be obtained through the exchange
of genetic materials between cocultured cells. Nuclear DNA
fingerprints showed that the cells that survived in uridine2 BrdU+
media in both coculture conditions had the same genetic identities
as the 143B cells (Fig. 3 A). More detailed data on DNA
fingerprinting are shown in Table S1. On the other hand, the
mtDNA hypervariable region sequences of those cells were
completely identical to those of the MSCs from both coculture
experiments of 143B r0 with MSCs (Fig. 3 B and Table S2) and
R6G-treated 143B r+ cells with MSCs (data not shown). To
further address whether mtDNAs from the MSCs replaced the
mtDNAs of R6G-treated cells, we repeated the coculture
experiment with R6G treatment, with a cybrid harboring 143B
nuclear genome and mtDNA with +10394 Dde I and +10397 Alu I
sites. The cells that survived in uridine2 BrdU+ media were found
to have mtDNAs with both 210394 Dde I and 210397 Alu I sites,
which were identical to those of the MSCs (Fig. 3 C). Taken
together, the cells that survived in uridine2 BrdU+ media were
trans-mitochondrial hybrid 143B cells (TM143B).
Functional characteristics of recuperated 143B
143B r0 and R6G-treated 143B r+ cells showed very low
intracellular ATP content (Fig. 4 A). The recuperated 143B cells
from r0 and R6G-treated 143B r+ cells exhibited a 3.3- and 3.7-
fold increase in intracellular ATP levels, respectively (Fig. 4 A).
The oxygen consumption rate was markedly decreased in both the
143B r0 and R6G-treated 143B r+ cells. However, the
recuperated 143B cells showed an approximate 7–10-fold increase
in oxygen consumption rates (Fig. 4 B).
Morphology and migratory ability of MSCs
A scanning EM examination was done on MSCs cultured for
24 h in their own culture medium (DMEM) or in conditioned
media, which were prepared by treating 143B r0 cells with
uridine-free media for 24 or 48 h. There was a marked difference
in the morphology of the MSCs in each medium: The MSCs in
their own medium looked like usual fibroblasts (Fig. 5 A), but those
in the conditioned media of 143B r0 cells looked activated and
outstretched numerous cellular projections, especially when
cultured in the 48 h conditioned medium (Fig. 5 B and C). Some
MSCs deposited small droplets onto the tissue culture plates,
which was more remarkable in the 48 h conditioned medium
(Fig. 5 C). In a cell migration assay, MSCs showed a significantly
increased migration in the conditioned media of 143B r0 cells
under no uridine supplementation, compared to under uridine
supplementation (1.6360.11 vs. 1.1760.15 in arbitrary units,
n = 6, p= 0.031 by Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Fig. 5 D).
A transmission EM examination was done after three days of
Stage I coculture. There were intercellular contacts between 143B
r0 and MSCs by cytoplasmic processes (Fig. 5 E) or broad surface
contact (Fig. 5 F); however, it is uncertain whether the
mitochondria around the cellular contact point were transferred
to the 143B r0 cells.
Coculture of MSCs with cybrids with pathogenic mtDNA
mutations
The cybrids harboring either A3243G mutation or 4,977 bp
deletion (both characterized by 210394 Dde I and 210397 Alu I)
did not show any massive cell death following the removal of
uridine, even in the condition of high mutation load (e.g.,
homoplasmy or ,100% of 3243G or $60,80% of mtDNA with
4,977 bp deletion). Survival in the restrictive medium may be
explained by some residual mitochondrial function of cybrids
harboring those mutations: the relative ATP content was
20.867.8%, 70.763.7%, and 56.763.8% in 143B r0 cells,
cybrids with ,100% of 3243G, and cybrids with ,80% of
4,977 bp deleted mtDNA, respectively, compared to their own
wild-type controls (n = 4); the relative oxygen consumption rate
was 7.561.4%, 28.463.3%, and 24.269.9% in 143B r0 cells,
cybrids with ,100% of 3243G, and cybrids with ,80% of
4,977 bp deleted mtDNA, respectively, compared to their own
controls (n = 4). Following the same scheme shown in Fig. 1, by
using a PCR-RFLP analysis, we could not find any evidence of the
transfer of mtDNA from the MSCs characterized by +10394 Dde I
and +10397 Alu I restriction sites (data not shown).
Time-course gene expression profile of the MSCs in
conditioned media from 143B r0 cells
Gene expression profiles of MSCs at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after
treatment with conditioned media, which were obtained by

2,653 genes showing statistically differential expression in any of
the five time points by Bayes-ANOVA (false discovery

rate,0.001). Using the self-organizing map (SOM) clustering
method, we grouped the 2,653 genes into 16 clusters by their
expression similarity across time series (Fig. S1). To assign the
biological meaning of each cluster, we performed a gene ontology
(GO)-based enrichment analysis. The genes in clusters 1, 4, 6, 12,
13, 15, and 16 were found to be mainly involved in differentiation,
intracellular transport, actin-filament regulation, chemotaxis, microtubule
regulation, synapse and cysteine metabolism, and response to stimuli,
respectively (Fig. S1 and Tables S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9).
To visualize the global relationship of individual clusters, we
performed a BioLattice [13] analysis with 49 clusters created by
SOM (Fig. S2), which was reanalyzed by using a more detailed
767 grid format with the same dataset used in Fig. S1. BioLattice
enables a better biological interpretation of microarray gene
expression data by organizing clusters into a unified lattice of
concepts [13]. Twelve clusters having at least one significant GO
term annotated in the biological process category (p,0.001) were
organized with 15 concepts created into a concept lattice (Fig. S3,
Tables S10 and S11). A core-periphery analysis determined ‘‘core’’
concepts of the MSCs to the response to the stimuli of r0
-
conditioned media such as C2, C3, and C13 (marked in red in Fig.
S3), which would to be more biologically relevant than the
‘‘periphery’’ concepts. More comprehensive analysis results for
other GO categories at various threshold levels are available at our
web site (http://www.snubi.org/publication/msc).
Discussion
By using biochemical selection methods, we hereby showed that
MSCs can transfer mitochondria to the cells lacking mtDNA,
which is consistent with the previous report [2]. All recuperated
cells were TM143B cybrid cells that contained the nuclear genome
of 143B cells and mtDNAs from the MSCs. Also, we demonstrated
the same phenomenon can take place in a condition with severe
mitochondrial dysfunction caused by non-genetic mitochondrial
toxin (R6G). However, such phenomena were not observed in the
cells harboring pathogenic mtDNA mutations such as A3243G
mutation or 4,977 bp deletion. These observations suggest that the
mitochondrial transfer may occur only in a situation with virtually
absent mitochondrial function. However, we could not exclude the

identities with 143B r0 cell nuclei. The boxed numbers and corresponding peaks represent locations of polymorphisms for each short tandem-repeat

which were identical to the MSCs.

which might be far below the detection limit, might be transferred
to those cybrid cells harboring A3243G mutation or 4,977 bp
deletion. Since it was proposed that mitochondrial diseases caused

Intercellular Mitochondrial Transfer

mitochondria [14,15], it is imperative to find a way to facilitate the
mitochondrial transfer to the cells with mitochondrial dysfunction
in humans. In this regard, it is very intriguing that partial cell
fusion and mitochondrial transfer may occur between human
multipotent stem cells and fully differentiated murine cardiomy￾ocytes, rendering the cardiomyocytes reprogrammed toward a
progenitor-like state [16].
Although a restoration of mitochondrial function in the cells
with severely compromised mitochondrial function was reported
[2], it remains uncertain whether the cells were rescued by the
transfer of intact mitochondrial particles or by the transfer of
mtDNA alone. We addressed this question with an experiment
using R6G as a mitochondrial toxin. R6G is a fluorescent dye that
binds tightly to the inner mitochondrial membrane and therefore
is a potent inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation [4]. It has been
used to remove the mitochondrial influence from one parental cell
line prior to the construction of cybrids using hamster [7], mouse
[5], and human cells [6]. Interestingly, in R6G-treated cells,
mtDNA was still detected after short-term exposure [6]. Consistent
with this report, we observed the presence of mtDNA in the R6G￾treated cells by PCR in this study. Since the rescued cells after
R6G treatment were revealed to contain mtDNAs from the
MSCs, the mtDNAs of the 143B r+ cells might have been
eventually removed following irreversible mitochondrial damage.
Therefore, our results suggest that the mitochondrial function was
restored by the transfer of intact mitochondrial particles rather
than the transfer of mtDNA alone.
There is growing body of evidence on the cell fusion. Adult and
embryonic stem cells have been reported to fuse with cardiomy￾ocytes, hepatocytes, and neurons [17,18,19,20], which might
contribute to the differentiation, plasticity, or maintenance of these
cell types. Permanent cell fusion may result in cells with unique
karyotypes (e.g., binucleated heterokaryons or mononucleated
hyperploid synkaryons) [21], while partial cell fusion allows
transient direct intercellular communication [22,23] and exchange
or transfer of multiple protein complexes [24] and even subcellular
organelles [25]. Since the recuperated cells have exactly the same
fingerprint pattern of the nuclear DNA of 143B cells, the nuclear
fusion between 143B-derived cells and MSCs was unlikely to take
place. Instead, we found that the sequences of mtDNAs of the
recuperated cells were identical to those of the MSCs. Therefore,
we can conclude that partial cell fusion mediated the rescue of
143B-derived cells with severely compromised mitochondrial
function.
The mechanism of mitochondrial transfer is considered as an
active cellular process, since no restoration of mitochondrial
function in cells lacking mtDNA was observed when cultured with
isolated mitochondria or platelets (platelets have mitochondria but
lack nuclei) [2]. This suggests that the response of the MSCs to the
stimuli from r0 cells in stress would be crucial in the mitochondrial
transfer. In this regard, our microarray data might shed light on
perspectives explaining possible mechanisms. The differentially
expressed genes—along with the time-series following the
treatment of conditioned media obtained by treating 143B r0
cells with uridine-free media for 48 h—were largely examined
within the context of chemotaxis, actin-filament regulation,
microtubule regulation, and cellular responses to various stimuli.
Indeed, it was recently revealed that f-actin and microtubule
filaments are essential in the process of partial cell fusion and
subsequent mitochondria transfer [16]. Also, we could not find any
rapidly growing colonies in the cell fusion experiment with
cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of chemotaxis and cytoskeletal
assembly. Taken together, some unknown factors secreted from
the cells with virtually absent mitochondrial function might
activate the MSC, prompting mitochondrial transfer by active
cellular processes.
Spees et al. [2] suggested that MSCs might transfer mitochon￾dria by directing cytoplasm toward r0 cells, either as cytoplasmic
extensions or broad areas of cellular contact. Consistent with these
findings, we also found in a transmission EM examination that
many MSCs were adjacent to r0 cells with cytoplasmic extensions
that contained elongated mitochondria or broad areas of plasma
membrane contact. However, the snap shot image cannot tell
whether mitochondria were transferred to r0 cells by these
processes. Recently, in a study adopting human multipotent
adipose-derived stem cells expressing Cre recombinase and
murine cardiomyocytes expressing LacZ gene under the control
of an internal stop codon flanked by loxP sites, partial cell fusion
and mitochondrial transfer through a very thin tube-like structure
were demonstrated by Xgal staining and time-lapse video
microscopy tracking MitoTracker-stained mitochondria [16]. All
together, either cytoplasmic extensions or broad cell-to-cell contact
may serve as the route of the intercellular mitochondrial transfer.
Although there are several theoretical strategies to treat
mitochondriopathies due to mtDNA mutations by gene therapy
[26], the practical implementation of such strategies is largely
hampered by the unique characteristics of mtDNA (polyplasmy
and heteroplasmy) [27]. Indeed, as of yet, nobody succeeded to
deliver DNA into mitochondria in a heritable manner [27].
However, it has been suggested that mitochondrial diseases elicited
by mtDNA mutations could be treated by exploiting the inter￾mitochondrial complementation through exchange of genetic
materials between mitochondria with normal and mutant
mtDNAs [14,15] In this regard, the elucidation of the mechanism
of the mitochondrial transfer by human MSCs will provide a
potential cell therapy-based mitochondrial gene therapy for
human mtDNA diseases.
Although it is yet to be elucidated what signal is involved in the
mitochondrial transfer, we found (i) MSCs restores mitochondrial
function of mtDNA-less cells and mitochondrial toxin-treated cells,
(ii) the mitochondrial transfer process may be a part of partial cell
fusion which is not accompanied by nuclear fusion, (iii) the
restoration of mitochondrial function may be mediated by the
transfer of intact mitochondrial particles not by the transfer of
mtDNA alone, (iv) the mitochondrial transfer to the cells
harboring pathogenic mtDNA mutations may not take place in
our experimental condition, (v) The process of mitochondrial
transfer may be mediated by active cellular mechanism(s)
including chemotaxis and other cellular responses to various
stimuli. Further studies are needed to reveal the molecular
mechanisms of mitochondrial transfer.
