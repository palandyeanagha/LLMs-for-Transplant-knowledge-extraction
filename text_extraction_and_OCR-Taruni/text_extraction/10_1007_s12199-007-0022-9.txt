Abstract
Objectives With greater concern for efficient resource
allocation and profiling of medical care, a case-mix clas￾sification was applied for the per-diem payment system in
Japan. Many questions remain, one of which is the role of
comorbidity and complication (CC) in grouping logic. We
examined the association of the number of CC with the
length of hospital stay (LOS) and hospital mortality as well
as the proportion of LOS high outliers in 19 major diag￾nostic categories (MDCs).
Methods This study was a secondary data analysis
embedded in a government research project, including
anonymous claims and clinical data during a 4-month
period from July 2002. Every 19 MDC, LOS, hospital
mortality or proportion of LOS high outliers was compared
by the number of CC and presence of any procedures.
Results From 82 special function hospitals, 241,268
patients were enrolled in this study. Among all patients,
50.5% were identified without any CCs, 32.4% with one or
two, 13.4% with three or four, and 3.7% with over five
CCs. The overall mean LOS was 22.15 days and hospital
mortality 26.05 cases per 1,000 admissions. In any MDC,
LOS and the proportion of outliers increased as the number
of CC rose. The mortality rate increased prominently in the
respiratory system and the hematology system.
Conclusions This study demonstrated that the occurrence
of more CC caused longer LOS and higher mortality in
some major disease categories. Further study will clarify
the association of the weighted CC with resource use
through controlling procedures specific for MDC.

Introduction
The role of comorbidities and complications (CC) in
inpatient medicine has been an intense area of investi￾gation, due to their impact on resource use, mortality,
functional status, quality of life, and delivery of health
care in Western societies [1–6]. Research on the impact
of CC on healthcare utilization and quality of medical
care is needed, as this is important to hospital payment
systems and medical outcome studies [7, 8]. Many

health-related problems increase with age, especially with
respect to the number of chronic conditions [1]. As the
proportion of chronic conditions increases across popu￾lations, practice behaviors will change that will impact
hospital costs. Meanwhile, innovative procedures have
been advocated for the elderly [9, 10]. Under these cir￾cumstances, the impact of CC or age on hospital resource
utilization has been examined for diseases such as dia￾betes mellitus or for hospitalizations of trauma patients
[11, 12].
In response to increasing costs associated with the
rapid evolution of healthcare technology, cost contain￾ment policies and case-mix classification systems have
advanced worldwide over the past 20 years [7, 8].
However, problems have emerged in situations where
some patients are under-reimbursed if they have more
CCs and have consumed more hospital resources than
those with fewer CCs. Munoz et al. [13] reported major
inequities in Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) prospective
payment systems for pediatric patients. Jencks et al. [14]
showed that the number of recorded diagnoses was
no higher for patients who died than for those who
survived. These studies focused on selected conditions,
such as pediatric illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and
pneumonia.
In this study, our goal was to demonstrate the associa￾tion of CCs with resource use and outcome by major
diagnostic category (MDC) and treatment group (medical
or surgical) using a large administrative database devel￾oped for the Japanese case-mix classification system
(Diagnosis Procedure Combination; DPC). This type of
systematic research has never been performed on this scale,
and the results may have some important policy implica￾tions, in which MDC CCs may be considered in prior risk
adjustment for payment or outcomes, such as resource use
or mortality. The aims of this study were to generate
descriptive statistics of CCs and to profile the association
of length of stay (LOS) and hospital mortality with the
number of CCs through the stratification of MDCs and
treatments. Furthermore, we identified the relationship
between the proportion of LOS high outliers and the
number of CCs for each MDC.
Materials and methods
We conducted a secondary data analysis of a government
research project on DPC development. Anonymous claims
information and clinical data were provided by the Min￾istry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) through a
research contract. Clinical data and claims information,
merged into a standardized electronic format, were gath￾ered by the MHLW for 266,677 patients who were
discharged from 82 academic hospitals (80 university
hospitals, National Cancer Center, and National Cardio￾vascular Center) between 1 July 2002 and 31 October
2002. The Japanese MHLW permits up to seven CCs (four
comorbidities and three complications) to be listed in the
DPC dataset. From this original dataset, we selected cases
with a LOS of up to 365 days and excluded patients who
died within 24 h of admission. A total of 241,268 patients
were enrolled in the study. We categorized patients into
three groups according to the number of CCs documented
(absent, 1 or 2, 3 or 4, and 5 or more), based on a study by
Munoz et al. [15].
The DPC system is made up of 16 MDCs. However, the
16th MDC consists of four different clinical entities: injury,
poisoning, burns and the toxic effect of drugs; mental
diseases and disorders; diseases and disorders of systemic
infection; and miscellaneous. We therefore divided the
16th MDC into these four groups and analyzed a total of 19
MDCs (Table 1). The DPC database also allows a maxi￾mum of five operative procedures to be listed, for which
the definition and pricing are determined from a nationally
uniform fee table under the standardized fee-for-service
payment system. Patients undergoing at least one surgical
procedure, as defined by the Japanese fee table, comprised
the ‘‘surgical group,’’ while patients not undergoing any
surgical procedure comprised the ‘‘medical group.’’ We
then divided patients into these two treatment groups for all
19 MDCs.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics were analyzed in terms of gender,
age (under 15, 15–64, and 65 years or older), and number
of procedures. The association between CC category and
each of these patient characteristics was assessed using
Fisher’s exact test. The association between these patient
characteristics and MDC was also assessed.
The mean age, LOS, and mortality rate per 1,000
admissions were calculated for each CC category and
compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean
LOS (days) and mortality rate (per 1,000 cases) were
illustrated using spider-radar charts, stratified by treatment
group (surgical or medical) and MDC. ANOVA was used
to compare the mean LOS and mortality rate by treatment
group for each MDC.
To define the proportion of high LOS outliers, we
identified the 95th percentile of LOS for each MDC and
categorized patients beyond that LOS into eight groups
(e.g., four CC groups by two treatment groups). We
then calculated the proportion of high LOS outliers
(the numerator is the number of LOS outliers and the
denominator is the number of all patients in the eight

groups) and demonstrated it with a broken line for
each MDC. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS version 14. All reported P values were two-tailed,
and the level of significance was accepted as less than
0.05.
Results
The most frequently documented MDC was the digestive
track, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic diseases (45,080 cases,
18.7% of all study cases) and the least frequently

documented MDC was systemic infections (1,147 cases,
0.5%). Eye diseases were more common in the surgical
group (17,974 cases, 80.7% of all eye diseases), while
patients with mental disorders received no surgical treat￾ment. When stratified by CC category, pediatric diseases
had the highest proportion of no CCs (64% in the medical
group and 70% in the surgical group) and cardiovascular
diseases (32% in the medical group and 31.5% in the
surgical group) had the lowest proportion of no CCs. On
the other hand, hematological diseases (8.1% of medical
patients and 12.7% of surgical patients) and systemic
infections (7.6 and 22.7%, respectively) had the highest
proportion of patients with five or more CCs (Table 1).
Among the 241,268 patients in the study population,
50.5% (47.8% of the medical group and 53.4% of the
surgical group) had no CCs; 32.4% (33.8 and 30.9,
respectively) had one or two CCs; 13.4% (14.9 and 11.8%,
respectively) had three or four CCs; and 3.7% (3.5 and
3.9%, respectively) had five or more CCs. The proportion
with no CCs ranged from 41.2% (38.6% of medical group
and 43.8% of surgical group) in patients 65 years and older
to 65.5% (60.4 and 72.8%, respectively) in patients less
than 15 years. The proportion of patients with one or two
CCs ranged from 25.9% for those less than 15 years to
35.4% for those 65 years or older; the proportion with three
or four CCs ranged from 6.5 to 18.2%; the proportion with
five or more CCs ranged from 2.1 to 5.2%. There was no
gender difference in the proportion of the four CC cate￾gories. In both the medical and surgical groups, the
proportion of patients with no CCs and with five or more
CCs was statistically different by age and gender. There
was a significant difference in the number of procedures for
the four CC categories (Table 2).
Overall, the mean age was 51.23 years and the mean
LOS was 22.15 days. For patients with no CCs, one or two
CCs, three or four CCs, and five or more CCs, the mean
ages were 47.09, 53.83, 59.05, and 59.26 years, respec￾tively, and the mean LOS were 17.38, 23.44, 30.60, and
45.47 days, respectively. The overall mortality rate per
1,000 admissions was 26.05 cases (13.51, 26.94, 46.94, and
104.09, respectively). There were significant differences in
age, LOS, and hospital mortality rate among the four CC
groups (Table 3). As the number of CCs increased, the
mean age, mean LOS, and mortality rate also increased.

The mean age and LOS were higher in the surgical group
than in the medical group, although mortality was higher in
the medical group.
The LOS for all MDCs, except for pediatric diseases,
increased as the number of CCs increased. In particular, the
mean LOS across the four CC categories was longer for
hematological diseases, whereas for eye diseases, it was
shortest and increased relatively slowly across the CC
categories. There was a significant difference in mean LOS
among the four CC categories within every MDC, except
for the pediatric surgical group (P = 0.084) (Fig. 1).
Across the four CC categories, the mortality rate was
higher for respiratory disease, digestive tract, hepatobiliary
and pancreatic diseases, and hematological diseases than in
other MDCs. The mortality rate was approximately zero for
eye diseases, skin and soft tissue diseases, mental disor￾ders, and in the pediatric surgical group. Apart from these
MDCs, the surgical group had a lower mortality rate than
the medical group for respiratory diseases, as well as for
digestive tract, hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. There
were significant differences in hospital mortality among the
CC categories within every MDC, except for eye diseases
(medical: P = 0.793, surgical P = 0.928), skin and soft
tissue diseases (P = 0.171), endocrine, nutritional, and
metabolic diseases (medical: P = 0.920, surgical P =
0.416), and mental disorders (P = 0.223) (Fig. 2).

The percentage of LOS high outliers increased as the
number of CCs increased for all MDCs. The percentage of
patients with five or more CCs was identified as 40–50% in
MDC14 and 15 (Fig. 3).
Discussion
This study describes the characteristics of patients with CC
and the association of LOS and mortality rate with the
number of CCs by analyzing a large administrative dataset
from Japan. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
provide a profile of LOS, hospital mortality, and proportion
of LOS high outliers across several diseases from a large
database. In all MDCs, both the LOS and the proportion of
outliers increased as the number of CCs increased, and the
increase was particularly prominent for neonatal and
pediatric diseases. Mortality was particularly high among
the higher CC categories for respiratory diseases, digestive
tract, hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases, and hemato￾logical diseases. Therefore, the number of CCs should be
taken into consideration in risk adjustment for mortality.
However, the mortality rate did not increase with higher
CC categories for eye diseases, skin and soft tissue dis￾eases, mental disorders, or in the pediatric surgical group.
There were several limitations to this study. First, we
gathered information from patients who were discharged
during only a 4-month period in 2002. Claims data,
including some clinical variables, are now being collected
throughout the year, so that it will soon be possible to
produce this type of study with a larger database. Second,
coding accuracy and quality were not taken into consid￾eration. At the start of this study, comorbidity was defined
by the MHLW as an associated disease or disorder at
admission, regardless of whether that condition was acute
or chronic and stable; complication was defined as events
occurring unexpectedly or owing to a planned procedure
after admission. Both of these were listed separately in the
dataset. Although there may be no case-mix classification
system in the world where the quality of coding can be
assured without chart review, coding guidelines and coder
training have been promoted by the Japanese Society of
Medical Record Administration. The peer review organi￾zation system for coding behavior and DPC creep will be in
demand, just like in other countries that are already

utilizing those kinds of case-mix classification systems
[16–19]. Third, there was a limitation of coding slots in the
DPC dataset, whereby only seven secondary diagnoses
(four comorbidities and three complications) could be lis￾ted. However, the dates and the amount of life-support care
or pharmaceutical agents, which may serve as proxy data
for some comorbidities or complications, were electroni￾cally collected in this DPC database [20]. A more detailed
and promising analysis of this data is expected in the near
future.
Given the paucity of this kind of analysis in the litera￾ture, it is useful to document the mean LOS, mortality
rates, and proportions of LOS high outliers by MDC and
treatment. In general, economic incentives may induce
problems like creeping or changing of coding response,
whereby institutions may list more CCs or truncate chronic
diagnoses unrelated to resource use, outcome, or payment
[21]. As a result, the number of recorded diagnoses on the
medical chart may not be significantly higher for patients
who die than for those who survive, and the number of CCs
would not be a reliable index for predicting complications
or hospital mortality. Therefore, setting aside the problem
of coding accuracy, this study provides basic but instruc￾tive suggestions, as the results were free of reporting bias,
due to the lack of opportunities for the up-coding of CCs
before the start of the DPC-based payment system.
Overall, the mean LOS in Japan may be longer than that
in Western countries. Japanese hospitals accommodate
patients with both acute and sub-acute or chronic illnesses,
functions that are typically performed by different facilities
in Western countries [22]. Table 3 shows that the overall
mean LOS was 22.15 days (20.39–42.52 days in medical
DPC and 24.02–48.30 in surgical DPC), which is two to six
times longer than any other country in the OECD Health
Data [23]. These hospitals may not be representative of
Japanese acute care hospitals, but these results may more
accurately reflect mortality and resource consumption,
which would not be captured in Western data that do not
include data from external care facilities and other auxil￾iary health facilities. It might be the strength of this study.
In our study, as the number of CCs increased, resource
use indices tended to increase for all MDCs, which corre￾sponded to the results of Munoz et al. [15]. They reported
that hospital cost, LOS, percentage of LOS outliers, and
mortality increased as the number of CCs per patient
increased, even for patients categorized into medical non￾complications and comorbidity-stratified DRG groups,
resulting in financial risk for hospitals without any DRG
adjustments based upon CCs. In another study by Munoz
et al. [13], major inequities in the DRG prospective hos￾pital payment system were confirmed for pediatric patients,
generating a financial burden for hospital management. For
example, if hospital cost correlates positively with LOS,
hematological diseases or systemic infections may cause
more financial loss, while eye diseases may not. Such
comparisons have policy implications, and further studies
are needed to examine the presence of cost-profit differ￾ences in Japan’s DPC system.
The number of CCs may also be selected as a risk factor
for LOS or hospital mortality for respiratory diseases, as
well as for digestive track, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic
diseases. The number of procedures specific for these
diseases, clinical severity, or difficulty of executing a
procedure in terms of experience or time consumed may
affect LOS, mortality, or LOS outlier among the MDCs.
Further evaluation will be needed to describe the associa￾tion of these clinical variables with the number of CCs or
some targeted CCs specific for every MDC.
The first key of DPC classification is principal diagnosis
and types of procedures or CCs determined by the DPC
group [24]. All of these determinant elements are listed in
the DPC definition table where many kinds of CCs are also
contained, ranging from chronic stable illnesses, such as
diabetes mellitus without organ damage, to acute or critical
conditions, such as cardiogenic shock [14, 15]. Each MDC
includes several CCs determined by the opinion of experts
from the relevant specialties. Our research team was
requested to identify the CCs responsible for more resource
use or higher mortality, while controlling for variables
affecting those indices, such as demographics and treat￾ment. According to the report of resource use variation
in cardiovascular diseases and malignant respiratory or
intestinal neoplasms, CCs had less incremental effect on
the proportion of variance in LOS or total charge than other
variables, such as treatment type and intensive or neo￾adjuvant therapy [25]. Among these diseases, CCs of
gastric or colonic neoplasms explained more variation than
those of any others. Some CCs are strongly associated with
other CCs, such as hypertension with atherosclerosis.
Therefore, further analyses of this kind will be needed to
identify CCs that consume more resources, particularly for
musculoskeletal diseases and neonatal disease. Through
this type of systematic investigation, we can readily answer
questions such as ‘‘Is the number of CCs correlated with
resource use or outcome?’’ or ‘‘Which factors have the
greatest impact on LOS or per diem payment: the number
of CCs, a specific CC, or certain treatments?’’ In making
decisions about payments, answering these types of ques￾tions will facilitate and improve financial allocation. In
addition, health policy makers could examine the extent
to which the number of CCs can explain variations in
resource use or outcomes, enabling a systematic compari￾son of healthcare performance across MDCs.
In conclusion, we assessed the association of the number
of CCs with LOS, hospital mortality, and the proportion of
LOS high outliers. In all MDCs, LOS and the proportion of

outliers increased as the number of CCs increased. This
study demonstrated that the number of CCs should be taken
into consideration in risk adjustment for mortality, espe￾cially for respiratory diseases, digestive tract, hepatobiliary
and pancreatic diseases, and hematological diseases. Mor￾tality rates were not associated with CCs for eye diseases,
skin and soft tissue diseases, mental disorders, and in the
pediatric surgical group. Further studies are needed to
investigate the type of CCs that impact outcomes and
resource use, as well as to assess the impact of CCs on
treatment selection. Calculating resource use or mortality
with weighted CCs, comparative profiling of CCs, and
determining associations of CCs with financial burden
across MDCs may all play important roles in policy mak￾ing for an equitable payment system.
