Introduction
Hepatorenal syndrome is a serious complication 
of cirrhosis that is associated with high morbidity 
and mortality. It is characterized by functional 
circulatory changes in the kidneys that over￾power physiologic compensatory mechanisms and 
lead to reduced glomerular filtration rate. Re￾establishment of adequate renal blood flow leads 
to improvement in renal function and is achieved 
with liver transplantation or vasoconstrictor drugs. 
The terminology, definition, and classification of 
hepatorenal syndrome have evolved considerably 
in the past 10 years owing to changes proposed for 
the diagnosis and staging of acute kidney injury 
(AKI). In this state of the art review, we focus on 
recent advances that have shaped the contemporary 
definition, diagnosis, and management of hepato￾renal syndrome.
Sources and selection criteria
We searched PubMed from January 2000 to October 
2019 using the keyword “hepatorenal syndrome”. 
We prioritized randomized clinical trials (RCTs), 
systematic reviews, and meta-analysis, when availa￾ble, excluding case reports and case series. We 
also reviewed published management guidelines 
from websites of professional societies (American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases; European 
Association for the Study of the Liver; Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes; and others). 
We included only full length, peer reviewed studies 
published in English, with the exception of recent 
high profile RCTs available only in abstract form.
Epidemiology and definitions
Acute impairment of renal function, as determined 
by an increase in serum creatinine, is reported 
in 19-26% of patients admitted to hospital with 
cirrhosis and 32% of patients with severe alcohol 
associated hepatitis.1-4
 Serum creatinine, however, 
underestimates decline in renal function in patients 
with cirrhosis owing to impaired hepatic production 
of creatine (the precursor of creatinine), reduced 
muscle mass, tubular secretion of creatinine, 
and inaccurate measurement of creatinine by 
calorimetric methods in the presence of elevated 
serum bilirubin.5 6 Therefore, alternative biomarkers 
with greater accuracy in patients with cirrhosis are 
urgently needed. Incorporating cystatin C, a cysteine 
proteinase inhibitor, into conventional creatinine 
based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) equations 
results in better diagnostic performance compared 
with conventional equations alone.7
Despite the limitations, serum creatinine remains 
the most widely available and inexpensive assay for 
estimation of GFR. In a non-steady state such as acute 
renal failure, serial changes in creatinine and urine 
output better reflect renal function. Consequently, 
the definition of acute renal failure has evolved over 
the past two decades. The RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, 
loss, and end stage kidney disease) classification, 
generated at the Consensus Conference of the Acute 
Dialysis Quality Initiative Group in 2002, consisted 
of percentage changes in serum creatinine or GFR, a 
decrease in urine output, or both.8
 This classification 
was later refined by a second multidisciplinary 
collaborative forum held in 2005, the Acute Kidney 
ABSTRACT
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), the extreme manifestation of renal impairment 
in patients with cirrhosis, is characterized by reduction in renal blood flow and 
glomerular filtration rate. Hepatorenal syndrome is diagnosed when kidney function 
is reduced but evidence of intrinsic kidney disease, such as hematuria, proteinuria, 
or abnormal kidney ultrasonography, is absent. Unlike other causes of acute kidney 
injury (AKI), hepatorenal syndrome results from functional changes in the renal 
circulation and is potentially reversible with liver transplantation or vasoconstrictor 
drugs. Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome are recognized depending on the 
acuity and progression of kidney injury. The first represents an acute impairment 
of kidney function, HRS-AKI, whereas the second represents a more chronic 
kidney dysfunction, HRS-CKD (chronic kidney disease). In this review, we provide 
critical insight into the definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of 
hepatorenal syndrome.

Injury Network (AKIN).9
 The AKIN first proposed the 
term acute kidney injury (AKI) to include the entire 
spectrum of acute renal failure and also added an 
absolute increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL 
within 48 hours of baseline as part of the definition 
of AKI. This change was based on accumulating 
evidence that even small acute increments in serum 
creatinine were associated with significant short 
term morbidity and mortality.10 11 In 2012 the 
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) 
organization published clinical practice guidelines 
further refining the diagnosis of AKI on the basis 
of the RIFLE and AKIN criteria. The KDIGO defined 
AKI as an increase in serum creatinine by at least 
0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) within 48 hours, an 
increase in serum creatinine to at least 1.5 times 
baseline within the previous seven days, or urine 
volume below 0.5 mL/kg/h for six hours.12
The definition of hepatorenal syndrome has 
likewise evolved in the past two decades to align 
with the changes proposed by the RIFLE, AKIN, and 
KDIGO guidelines. In 1990 the International Club of 
Ascites (ICA) defined acute renal failure in cirrhosis 
as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 50% 
from baseline to a final concentration of at least 
1.5 mg/dL. Hepatorenal syndrome was further sub￾classified into two clinical types: type 1, defined 
as rapid reduction of renal function by doubling 
of initial serum creatinine to a concentration of at 
least 2.5 mg/dL or a 50% reduction in less than two 
weeks in the initial 24 hour creatinine clearance to 
below 20 mL/min; and type 2, in which renal failure 
progression did not meet the criteria for type I.13
Several recent studies showed that the diagnosis of 
AKI in patients with cirrhosis, based on an absolute 
increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL 
or 50% from baseline, leads to earlier identification 
of patients at increased risk of longer hospital stay, 
multi-organ failure, admission to intensive care, and 
in-hospital mortality as well as 90 day mortality.1 14-18
This led the ICA to issue a revised set of consensus 
recommendations in 2015, incorporating a new 
definition and classification of AKI with modifications 
(box 1).19 A serum creatinine concentration obtained 
in the previous three months can be used as baseline 
when a concentration in the previous seven days is 
not available. The ICA also eliminated urine output 
in the revised definition of AKI, owing to expected 
lower urine output at baseline in patients with 
cirrhosis due to avid sodium and water retention. 
However, a recent study showed that patients in the 
intensive care unit with reduction in urine output to 
below 0.5 mL/kg for at least six hours had a higher 
mortality than did those who met only the creatinine 
criteria for AKI.20 Therefore, accurate urine output 
(for example, when obtained through a urinary 
catheter) may be used for diagnosis and staging of 
AKI.21
The ICA also updated the definition of hepatorenal 
syndrome (HRS) type 1, now termed HRS-AKI. The 
two week interval required for doubling in serum 
creatinine in the previous definition could lead 
to a delay in starting treatment for hepatorenal 
syndrome; several studies have shown that the higher 
the creatinine at the start of treatment, the lower the 
probability of reversal of hepatorenal syndrome.22 23
Therefore, no minimum creatinine value is needed 
for the diagnosis of HRS-AKI according to the updated 
definition. That is, HRS-AKI can be diagnosed even 
when the serum creatinine is below 2.5 mg/dL.
Functional kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis 
that does not meet the criteria for HRS-AKI is termed 
HRS-NAKI (that is, non-AKI) and is defined by 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather 
than serum creatinine.24 NAKI is divided into HRS￾acute kidney disease (HRS-AKD) if the eGFR is less 
than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
 for less than three months 
and HRS-chronic kidney disease (HRS-CKD) if it is 
less than this for more than three months (fig 1).
Pathophysiology
Our understanding of the pathophysiology of 
hepatorenal syndrome is mostly based on observa￾tional studies in humans because of the lack of a 
reproducible experimental model of hepatorenal 
syndrome. The challenge faced with animal 
models is the inability to induce severe liver injury 
without direct kidney toxicity as with carbon 
tetrachloride and thioacetamide. Nevertheless, 
clinical and histopathologic observations point to 
an uncompensated hyperdynamic circulation as 
the hallmark of AKI-HRS. Additional contributors to 
development of AKI-HRS include systemic inflam￾mation, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, and adrenal 
insufficiency.
Circulatory dysfunction
The hemodynamic changes in patients with cirrhosis 
are linked to sodium retention, development of 
ascites, and subsequent renal dysfunction.25
Cirrhosis results in elevated intrahepatic vascular 
resistance but splanchnic vasodilatation due to

increased production of vasodilators, including 
nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, prostacyclins, and 
endocannabinoids, in the splanchnic circulation. 
Systemic vasodilation results in reduction of effective 
arterial blood volume (EABV) and systemic arterial 
pressure. With progression of liver disease, reduction 
in cardiac output often precedes the development of 
hepatorenal syndrome, while the peripheral vascular 
resistance remains unchanged.26 These findings 
suggest a role for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in the 
pathogenesis of hepatorenal syndrome.
Systemic vasoconstrictor pathways, such as the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic 
nervous system, and arginine vasopressin, are 
activated as a means of increasing the EABV. 
These mechanisms result in sodium retention, 
impaired solute-free water excretion and renal 
vasoconstriction, and, consequently, reduced renal 
blood flow (fig 2).
In earlier stages, the kidneys are able to maintain 
a normal glomerular filtration rate owing to 
the vasodilatory effect of renal prostaglandins 
(prostaglandin I2 and prostaglandin E2) on afferent 
renal arterioles. Thus, glomerular pressure can 
initially be maintained despite reduced renal blood 
flow. This balance is disrupted with progression 
of liver disease and by drugs such as non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory agents that inhibit prostaglandin 
synthesis and reduce filtration fraction, leading to 
AKI.
Elevated ammonia in cirrhosis disrupts metabolism 
of arginine, an essential amino acid for the synthesis 
of nitric oxide.27 Decreased availability of nitric oxide 
in the renal microcirculation contributes to impaired 
renal blood flow and consequent functional and 
ischemic kidney injury.
Systemic inflammation
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome has been 
observed in almost half of patients with AKI-HRS, 
independent of the presence of infection.28 More￾over, plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory

cytokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion protein-1, and 
interleukin-8) and urinary concentrations of mono￾cyte chemoattractant protein-1 are increased in 
patients with AKI-HRS compared with those with 
decompensated cirrhosis without AKI and patients 
with AKI secondary to pre-renal azotemia.29
Inflammation in cirrhosis is driven by two groups of 
molecules: pathogen associated molecular patterns 
(PAMPs) and damage associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs). PAMPs represent bacterial products, such 
as lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, and nigericin, which 
result from translocation of gut bacteria or bacterial 
infections, whereas DAMPs represent intracellular 
components released from injured hepatocytes, 
including high mobility group protein B1, heat shock 
protein, adenosine triphosphate, double stranded 
genomic DNA, and others. In the absence of overt 
bacterial infection, both PAMPs and DAMPs may 
drive inflammation and release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines through activation of pattern recognition 
receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). The 
systemic pro-inflammatory response, in turn, may 
lead to increased arterial production of vasodilators 
(such as nitric oxide) and, consequently, further 
reduction in systemic vascular resistance and EABV.
In addition to a systemic effect, DAMPs and PAMPs 
may have a direct role in the kidneys. Patients with 
cirrhosis and renal dysfunction show increased 
expression of TLR4 receptors and caspase-3 in 
tubular renal cells, both important components of 
the innate immune system.30 Gut decontamination 
has been shown to reduce renal expression of TLR4 
and prevent renal dysfunction and tubular damage 
in animal models of cirrhosis, suggesting that 
increased TLR4 expression in the kidneys may result 
from exposure to PAMPs.31 Expression of TLR4 and 
other pattern recognition receptors may also increase 
as a result of renal ischemia secondary to reduced 
renal blood flow in hepatorenal syndrome.32  33
In experimental models of ischemic AKI, innate 
immunity has been shown to be responsible for 
the renal damage.34 Nevertheless, further studies 
are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms by 
which systemic inflammation leads to hepatorenal 
syndrome.
Hepato-adrenal syndrome
Relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) is present in 
24-47% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis 
and ascites and may play a role in the develop￾ment of hepatorenal syndrome.35-37 Compared with 
patients with normal adrenal function, those with 
RAI have lower arterial pressure and higher serum 
concentrations of renin and noradrenaline and are 
at increased risk of AKI-HRS, sepsis, and short term 
mortality.37-40
The mechanisms leading to the development of 
hepato-adrenal syndrome remain elusive but may 
relate to exhaustion of substrates for synthesis 
of cortisol and impairment of the hypothalamus￾pituitary axis by circulating PAMPs and pro￾B,QWUDKHSDWLFUHVLVWDQFH

inflammatory cytokines.41 42 Treatment with hydro￾cortisone may improve outcomes in patients with 
RAI and septic shock, including shock resolution 
and short term survival.43 However, the effect of 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy for hepato￾adrenal syndrome in the absence of shock and its 
role in prevention and treatment of hepatorenal 
syndrome remain to be determined.
Cholemic (or bile cast) nephropathy
Cholemic nephropathy has long been reported in 
patients with cirrhosis and high serum bilirubin 
concentrations and is thought to be caused by 
formation of obstructing intratubular bile acid 
casts and direct bile acid toxicity to tubular cells. 
Histopathologic studies have shown the presence 
of intratubular bile acid casts in 18-75% of patients 
with AKI-HRS.44 45 Urinary bilirubin and urobilinogen 
are elevated in most patients and may be clues to the 
diagnosis.44 Cholemic nephropathy may be present 
in most patients with jaundice and AKI-HRS and 
possibly affects outcomes and treatment response, 
but the prevalence is likely underestimated. Serum 
bilirubin concentrations above 10 mg/dL have 
been associated with a lower rate of response to 
vasoconstrictors in patients with AKI-HRS compared 
with patients with serum bilirubin below 10 mg/dL 
(13% v 67%; P=0.001).46 47 Treatments targeting 
bile acids in patients with jaundice and AKI-HRS 
may therefore be beneficial. A recent study in an 
experimental model of biliary cirrhosis showed 
that administration of norursodeoxycholic acid 
ameliorates renal function and histologic findings 
and may represent a therapeutic option for cholemic 
nephropathy.48 Nevertheless, the pathophysiologic 
contribution of cholemic nephropathy to AKI-HRS 
has not been convincingly demonstrated and needs 
further investigation.
Intra-abdominal hypertension
Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (>12 mm Hg) is 
an underappreciated cause of AKI and may play a 
role in the development of hepatorenal syndrome 
in patients with refractory ascites. A small study 
assessing the short term effects of paracentesis 
in patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed a 
significant improvement in creatinine clearance after 
reduction of intra-abdominal pressure.49 However, 
careful monitoring of systemic hemodynamic 
parameters with guided plasma expansion to 
prevent development of post-paracentesis circu￾latory dysfunction is paramount. The use of bedside 
echocardiography for estimation of inferior vena cava 
diameter and collapsibility may help to determine 
whether intra-abdominal hypertension might be 
contributing to renal dysfunction and, thus, help 
to identify which patients may benefit from large 
volume paracenteses.50
Hepatorenal reflex hypothesis
A link between the kidneys and the liver has 
long been proposed, suggesting the presence of 
osmoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and baroreceptors 
in the liver that directly affect kidney function 
through complex neural circuits.51 This hypothesis 
has been supported by several experimental studies 
through manipulation of portal blood osmolality 
and/or chemical composition, as well as changes 
in portal pressure. One animal study showed that 
activation of intrahepatic adenosine receptors in 
response to reduced portal venous blood flow results 
in renal sodium and water retention, similar to that 
observed in hepatorenal syndrome.52 Although these 
findings may have important clinical implications, 
further studies translating these results to humans 
are needed.
Differential diagnosis and biomarkers
One important diagnostic criterion for AKI-HRS is 
exclusion of structural kidney injury, which relies 
on urine microscopy and urine sodium excretion. 
Pre-renal azotemia represents the leading cause of 
AKI in patients with cirrhosis (46-66% of all cases), 
owing to frequent use of diuretics, large volume 
paracenteses without albumin, gastrointestinal 
bleeding, and gastrointestinal fluid losses secondary 
to lactulose induced diarrhea.53 54 The reported 
prevalence of AKI-HRS and acute tubular necrosis 
(ATN) varies widely, likely reflecting the challenge in 
differentiating the two conditions. The diagnosis of 
AKI-HRS requires the absence of shock, proteinuria 
(>500 mg/day), and microhematuria (>50 red blood 
cells per high power field), along with normal renal 
ultrasonography. However, patients who fulfill these 
criteria may still have tubular damage, so ATN cannot 
be confidently excluded.
Some experts have used urinary sodium 
(>40 mEq/L), fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa 
>2%), and low urine osmolality (<400 mOsm/L) as 
suggestive of ATN; however, urinary sodium can be 
elevated secondary to diuretics, frequently used in 
this group of patients with large volume ascites.55
Conversely, low FeNa has also been observed in 
patients with biopsy proven ATN,56 so urinary 
sodium and FeNa are no longer part of the diagnostic 
criteria of AKI-HRS. Studies in patients without liver 
disease have found that fractional excretion of urea 
is superior to FeNa in differentiating AKI-HRS from 
ATN in patients taking diuretics.57 Reabsorption of 
urea, as opposed to sodium, occurs primarily in the 
proximal renal tubules and, therefore, is not affected 
by diuretics such as furosemide and spironolactone, 
which act in the loop of Henle and distal tubules, 
respectively.57 In a recent study assessing the role 
of fractional excretion of urea in derivation and 
validation cohorts of patients with cirrhosis and 
AKI taking diuretics, the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve to differentiate ATN 
from other causes (cut-off 33.4, sensitivity 85, and 
specificity 100) was 0.96.58
Novel urine biomarkers of tubular injury have 
long been sought to differentiate AKI-HRS and ATN 
in patients with cirrhosis. Candidate biomarkers 
include tubular proteins released during cell damage Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

diminished tubular reabsorption (α-1-microglobulin, 
β-2-microglobulin, retinol binding protein), and 
markers of inflammation (interleukin-18).59 60
Among these, NGAL has been the most widely 
studied biomarker in patients with cirrhosis and 
has shown the greatest diagnostic accuracy in 
differentiating ATN from AKI-HRS.61-66 Urinary NGAL 
seems to be superior to plasma concentrations and 
performs better when measured after the two day 
volume challenge recommended in the management 
of AKI. The urinary NGAL cut-off value of 220 µg/g 
of creatinine obtained after the fluid challenge has 
the highest diagnostic accuracy for ATN (odds ratio 
42.9, 95% confidence interval 13.9 to 132.3).64
Moreover, urinary NGAL is an independent predictor 
of short term mortality.62 64 66 One of the limitations 
of biomarker studies in this population is the lack of 
a gold standard short of kidney biopsy. Because of 
the inherent risks, kidney biopsies are not routinely 
obtained in clinical practice, and human studies rely 
on expert adjudication for differentiating ATN from 
AKI-HRS. Nevertheless, the results are encouraging 
and justify further study.
Risk factors and prevention
Hyponatremia, high plasma renin activity, and liver 
size,67 as well as severity of ascites,68 are predictors 
of AKI- HRS. Acute hemodynamic changes associated 
with infections and large volume paracentesis 
without albumin administration represent the 
most common precipitants of AKI-HRS. The 
prevalence of unprecipitated AKI is low (1.8%).68
AKI-HRS develops in as many as 30% of patients 
with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP),69 as 
well as other infections,70 71 and is associated with 
worse outcomes.47 72 Infection associated AKI-HRS 
may be prevented by administration of intravenous 
albumin in addition to antibiotic treatment in the 
setting of SBP (8.3% v 30.6% with antibiotics alone; 
P=0.01) and may reduce overall mortality (16% v
35.4%; odds ratio 0.34, 0.19 to 0.60).73 74 Albumin 
administration in patients with infections other 
than SBP may also improve circulatory function and 
delay the development of renal dysfunction,75 but it 
has not been shown to prevent AKI-HRS or improve 
survival.76-78
Long term use of weekly albumin in patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites has been 
assessed in a large RCT (n=431). Compared with 
standard of care, the addition of weekly albumin 
for 18 months improved overall survival (77% v
66%; P=0.028) and also reduced the incidence of 
hepatorenal syndrome (odds ratio 0.39, 0.19 to 
0.76).79 In contrast, a similar trial evaluating the long 
term use of albumin and midodrine in 196 patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis on the waitlist for liver 
transplantation failed to show a survival benefit at 
one year, and complications of cirrhosis were not 
prevented. However, in this latter study only a small 
number of patients completed a full year on the 
study and the median length of treatment was only 
80 days.80 The forthcoming PRECIOSA12 (Effects 
of Long term Administration of Human Albumin in 
Subjects With Decompensated Cirrhosis and Ascites) 
trial will hopefully elucidate the role of long term 
albumin use in this population.
Antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of 
SBP, as determined by low ascitic fluid protein 
(<1.5 mg/dL) associated with liver and/or kidney 
dysfunction (bilirubin >3 mg/dL, serum sodium 
<130 mEq/L, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score >10, and/
or serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dL), not only prevents 
development of SBP but also significantly reduces 
the risk of AKI-HRS and overall mortality.81 82
Post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction occurs 
after large volume paracenteses (≥4-5 L) and is 
associated with hypotension, hyponatremia, and 
increased risk of AKI-HRS.83 Albumin administration 
following a large volume paracentesis significantly 
reduces this risk and improves overall survival in 
these patients.84 85 This protective effect seems to 
be unique to albumin, compared with other volume 
expanders,85 which suggests an additional benefit 
of albumin beyond simply volume expansion.86
Albumin has important antioxidant and anti￾inflammatory properties and helps to stabilize 
endothelial function.87 88 Moreover, human albu￾min is able to bind and potentially inactivate 
endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) and so may reduce 
their negative effect on circulatory and kidney 
functions.89 Given its potential immunomodulatory 
effects,90 albumin is being investigated in an RCT for 
prevention of infection in cirrhosis.91
Management
The updated diagnostic criteria, with removal of a 
minimum serum creatinine concentration, allow for 
earlier diagnosis and treatment of AKI-HRS. Rather 
than waiting for a doubling of creatinine to reach 2.5 
g/dL, drug treatment may now be started immediately 
after an unsuccessful fluid challenge. This is likely to 
result in higher reversal rates and better outcomes, as 
response to vasoconstrictors is dependent on the serum 
creatinine concentration at the start of treatment.22
Nevertheless, AKI stage 1A (serum creatinine 
<1.5 g/dL) is most often secondary to hypovolemia 
and is expected to resolve in more than 90% of 
patients at this stage, compared with a half of patients 
with stage 1B disease (serum creatinine ≥1.5 g/dL).3 54
Therefore, European Association for the Study of the 
Liver (EASL) guidelines recommend reserving the use 
of vasoconstrictors for patients with AKI-HRS stage 
1B or greater (fig 3).92 However, in most countries, the 
use of vasoconstrictors is indicated for hepatorenal 
syndrome type 1, based on the old definition, and 
the use of vasoconstrictors in patients with creatinine 
below 2.5 mg/dL is considered off-label.

hepatorenal syndrome starts with a fluid challenge Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

of 20-25% intravenous albumin at 1 g/kg/day for 
two days and withdrawal of diuretics. This is not 
only needed to rule out pre-renal azotemia but 
also promotes early plasma volume expansion in 
the setting of reduced EABV. This initial phase also 
includes temporary discontinuation of non-selective 
β blockers given their negative inotropic effect, 
which reduces cardiac output.93 94 These should be 
carefully reinstituted once renal function and mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) improve.93
The specific treatment of AKI-HRS comprises 
vasoconstrictors in combination with albumin infu￾sion and reversal of precipitant factors. Bacterial 
infections, particularly SBP, should be ruled out 
by blood, urine, and ascitic fluid cultures and a 
chest radiograph. Although antibiotics may help to 
prevent development of AKI-HRS,81 95 96 their benefit 
in patients with established AKI-HRS in the absence 
of infection has not been demonstrated.
Vasoconstrictors
Splanchnic vasoconstriction in patients with cirrho￾sis results in a reduction in portal pressure and an 
increase in EABV and renal blood flow, especially 
when combined with intravenous administration 
of albumin. Renal perfusion directly correlates 
with changes in MAP and is negatively affected 
by intra-abdominal pressure driven by ascites. A 
significant increase in MAP promoted by the use 
of vasoconstrictors is associated with a higher 
likelihood of reversal of hepatorenal syndrome.97
Several RCTs have confirmed the efficacy of 
vasoconstrictors, which represent the mainstay 
treatment of AKI-HRS.98 The available options include 
terlipressin, noradrenaline, and the combination of 
midodrine plus octreotide.
Terlipressin is not yet available in North America but 
can be prescribed to treat AKI-HRS in many European 
and Asian countries. Terlipressin, a synthetic 
vasopressin analog with predominant vasopressin 
1A receptor effect, acts primarily as a splanchnic 
vasoconstrictor.99 In addition, terlipressin activates 
vasopressin 1B receptors, which stimulate release 
of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol and 
might counteract the relative adrenal insufficiency 
commonly observed in patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis.100 Furthermore, terlipressin shows greater 
efficacy in reversal of AKI-HRS in patients with a 
systemic inflammatory response,101 which may relate 
to indirect vasopressin mediated anti-inflammatory 
effects.102 An agent with selective vasopressin 1 
activity is preferable in patients with cirrhosis to

prevent unwanted solute-free water absorption and 
consequent worsening hyponatremia and volume 
overload induced by renal vasopressin 2 receptor 
activation.103 Because terlipressin is also a modest 
vasopressin 2 receptor agonist,99 an acute reduction 
in serum sodium concentration may occur, although 
this effect is mainly observed in patients with 
cirrhosis without ascites treated with terlipressin for 
variceal bleeding.104 A novel selective vasopressin 
1A receptor agonist, selepressin, has recently 
been investigated as an alternative to vasopressin 
in management of septic shock and has shown a 
lower risk of hyponatremia, volume overload, and 
pulmonary edema in animal models of sepsis.105 106
The role of selepressin in hepatorenal syndrome 
warrants further study.
Norepinephrine (intravenous) and midodrine 
(oral) are systemic vasoconstrictors through 
activation of α-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular 
smooth muscle cells. Octreotide, a somatostatin 
analog, acts by inhibiting secretion of glucagon, a 
splanchnic vasodilator, and is a direct mesenteric 
vasoconstrictor.107 However, the effect of octreotide in 
patients with cirrhosis is dampened by antagonistic 
effects of local nitric oxide release,108 and 
octreotide alone has limited benefit in hepatorenal 
syndrome.109 Midodrine monotherapy also does not 
improve renal function in patients with hepatorenal 
syndrome despite its hemodynamic effects.110 In 
contrast, a combination of octreotide and midodrine 
has potential benefit in hepatorenal syndrome and 
has become the standard of care in countries where 
terlipressin is not yet approved.111 112
Efficacy
Comparative studies (some of them open label) 
evaluating terlipressin, norepinephrine, and/or 
octreotide/midodrine have found terlipressin, in 
combination with intravenous albumin, to be the 
most effective drug treatment for AKI-HRS (table 
1).23 113-122 The efficacy of terlipressin plus albumin 
in achieving complete reversal of hepatorenal 
syndrome, defined as at least 50% reduction in 
serum creatinine to a final value below 1.5 mg/dL, 
ranges from 19% to 56% compared with 3-14% 
with albumin alone.23 101 115 118 121 Conversely, 
administration of terlipressin alone is markedly 
inferior to a combination of terlipressin and albumin 
(complete hepatorenal syndrome reversal rates of 
25% and 77%, respectively).123 Two large European 
trials and one North American trial have shown 
efficacy for terlipressin.23 115 124 However, in the 
REVERSE study, a large multicenter phase III trial, 
terlipressin led to complete reversal of hepatorenal 
syndrome in only 19.6% of patients compared 
with 13.1% in the placebo group (P=0.22).116 One 
of the potential reasons for the discrepant results 
was the requirement for a confirmatory creatinine 
concentration below 1.5 mg/dL 48 hours after initial 
hepatorenal syndrome reversal, which was not 
available in many patients owing to discharge from 
hospital or transplantation. Another reason could 
be the short duration of treatment with terlipressin 
in a large number of patients. This has led to the 
execution of yet another RCT in North America 
designed to overcome the methodological obstacles 
encountered in the REVERSE trial. The CONFIRM 
study has been published only in abstract form. The 
verified hepatorenal syndrome reversal rate with 
terlipressin plus albumin was 29.1% compared with 
15.8% with albumin plus placebo (P<0.012).117
Norepinephrine is also effective and safe in AKI￾HRS,
125 with similar rates of hepatorenal syndrome 
reversal to terlipressin in small randomized studies, 
ranging between 39% and 70%.118-120 Norepinephrine 
is less expensive than terlipressin; however, central 
line placement and admission to an intensive care 
unit are needed for administration, which may offset 
the cost benefit. Terlipressin may be given through a 
peripheral line on the medical floor.119
Only one study has directly compared combination 
midodrine/octreotide with terlipressin.121 The 
complete response rate for midodrine/octreotide was 
only 4.8% compared with 55.5% with terlipressin, 
and the overall response (complete or partial) rates 
were 28.6% and 70.4%, respectively. Although no 
placebo controlled studies have been done with 
either norepinephrine or midodrine/octreotide, 
a recent network meta-analysis has allowed for 
indirect comparisons across trials. Compared with 
placebo, combination midodrine/octreotide was 
not significantly superior in achieving reversal of 
hepatorenal syndrome (odds ratio 0.44, 0.06 to 
3.23), whereas norepinephrine and terlipressin were 
both superior to midodrine/octreotide and placebo 
and were equally effective.98
Side effects
The most common side effects of terlipressin are 
diarrhea and abdominal pain, reported in 10-20% 
of patients overall. Discontinuation of terlipressin 
due to serious adverse events is needed in 4-22% 
(median 8%) of patients, with a rate of peripheral 
ischemic events between 4% and 13%. The rate of 
myocardial infarction or intestinal ischemia ranges 
from 2% to 13%.98 Pulmonary edema may occur in 
patients with hepatorenal syndrome treated with 
terlipressin and albumin, and volume status should be 
carefully monitored in these patients.116 Continuous 
terlipressin infusion is associated with a lower rate of 
adverse events compared with bolus administration, 
likely owing to lower dosing needed.124 Nevertheless, 
patients should be monitored at least twice daily for 
signs of ischemia in skin, tongue, and fingers while on 
therapy, and terlipressin should be avoided in patients 
with a history of coronary artery disease or peripheral 
vascular disease.92 Discontinuation of treatment due 
to adverse events is less common with norepinephrine 
and midodrine/octreotide; however, tachyarrhythmias 
or bradycardia can be seen (table 2).121

treatment, including model for end stage liver 
disease (MELD) score,126 pretreatment serum 
creatinine concentration,22 23 sepsis,126 extrahepatic 
organ failure,127 and systemic inflammation.29
Lower serum creatinine concentrations at the start 
of treatment are associated with higher rates of 
HRS reversal, whereas only a negligible response is 
expected when creatinine exceeds 7 g/dL.22 23 Thus, 
earlier diagnosis of AKI-HRS with the elimination of 
creatinine concentration cut-off, will likely result in 
higher rates of response to treatment. Total serum 
bilirubin concentration has also been found to 
predict response, with an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (P<0.0001) 
for a bilirubin cut-off of 10 mg/dL.46 These findings 
suggest the presence of structural damage.
Finally, response to treatment with vasoactive 
agents directly correlates with sustained increase 
in MAP.97 Independent of the agents used, 
improvement in renal function is preceded by a 
sustained rise in MAP by 5-10 mm Hg on average 
from baseline.22 46 111
Albumin
Albumin infusion is essential for effective 
management of AKI-HRS. Several studies provide 
supportive evidence for a multifaceted mode of 
action by albumin, which may also include volume 
expansion and positive cardiac inotropic effect,128
as well as antioxidant and immunomodulatory 
properties.88 129 130 In a single non-randomized 
study comparing terlipressin plus albumin versus 
terlipressin alone, the combination with albumin 
resulted in a significantly higher response (77% 
v 25%; P=0.03).123 In addition to plasma volume 
expansion and consequent increase in EABV, albumin 
has shown several other benefits in hepatorenal 
syndrome. In a study comparing hydroxyethyl 
starch, a synthetic colloid, with albumin in patients 
with SBP, albumin use was associated with lower 
plasma concentrations of von Willebrand related 
antigen and factor VIII, suggesting that albumin, 
but not hydroxyethyl starch, may reduce endothelial 
activation.86
One important property of albumin is its ability to 
bind a wide range of substances including bile acids, 
hormones, cytokines, long chain fatty acids, nitric 
oxide, endotoxin, and other bacterial products.131
This is the basis for the advent of molecular 
absorbent recirculatory systems, a modified dia￾lysis method that clears substances bound to 
albumin. This results in a significant reduction in 
serum creatinine concentrations in patients with 
hepatorenal syndrome.132 However, improvement 
in renal function and systemic hemodynamics is 
not observed in patients with hepatorenal syndrome 
refractory to vasoconstrictors, despite reduction in 
nitric oxide concentrations.133

The creation of an intrahepatic shunt aimed at 
reducing portal pressure has shown significant 
benefit in patients with cirrhosis who cannot tolerate 
diuretics or have refractory ascites and who have 
uncontrolled variceal bleeding.134 135 However, only 
a few studies have explored the role of transjugular 
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion 
in AKI-HRS, so its use remains investigational in 
this group. One small non-randomized study showed 
significant improvement in renal function after TIPS 
insertion for AKI-HRS, with reduction in plasma 
renin activity and aldosterone and norepinephrine 
concentrations.136 A meta-analysis including nine 
studies in which 128 patients with hepatorenal 
syndrome underwent TIPS insertion (77 patients 
with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 and 51 patients 
with type 2), showed significant improvement 
in serum creatinine, serum sodium, and urine 
output.137 Patients with markedly elevated bilirubin, 
active infection, or overt hepatic encephalopathy 
were excluded, so the role of TIPS in hepatorenal 
syndrome may be limited to a highly selected group of 
patients. On the other hand, TIPS may have a greater

Strong
Terlipressin plus albumin should be considered as the first line therapeutic option for the treatment of HRS-AKI. Terlipressin can be used by 
iv boluses at the initial dose of 1 mg every 4-6 h. However, giving terlipressin by continuous iv infusion at initial dose of 2 mg/day makes 
reduction of the global daily dose of the drug, and thus the rate of its adverse effects, possible. In case of non-response (decrease in SCr 
<25% from the peak value), after two days, the dose of terlipressin should be increased in a stepwise manner to a maximum of 12 mg/day
Strong
Albumin solution (20%) should be used at a dose of 20-40 g/day. Ideally, apart from routinely monitoring patients with HRS-AKI, the serial 
measurement of CVP or other measures of assessing central blood volume can help to prevent circulatory overload by optimizing the fluid 
balance and helping to titrate the dose of albumin
Strong
Noradrenaline can be an alternative to terlipressin. However, limited information is available Weak
In contrast to terlipressin, the use of noradrenaline always requires a central venous line and, in several countries, the transfer 
of the patient to an ICU. Midodrine plus octreotide can be an option only when terlipressin and noradrenaline are unavailable, 
but its efficacy is much lower than that of terlipressin
Strong
According to the new definition of HRS-AKI, complete response to treatment should be defined by a final SCr within 
0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) from the baseline value, while partial response should be defined by the regression of AKI stage to a 
final SCr ≥0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) from the baseline value
Strong
Adverse events related to terlipressin or noradrenaline include ischemic and cardiovascular events. Thus, a careful clinical screening including 
electrocardiography is recommended before starting the treatment. Patients can be treated on a regular ward, but the decision to transfer to 
higher dependency care should be case based. For the duration of treatment, close monitoring of patients is important. According to the type 
and severity of side effects, treatment should be modified or discontinued
Strong
In cases of recurrence of HRS-AKI on cessation of treatment, a repeat course of therapy should be given Strong
Terlipressin plus albumin is also effective in the treatment of HRS outside the criteria of AKI (HRS-NAKI), formerly known as HRS type II. 
Unfortunately, recurrence after the withdrawal of treatment is the norm, and data on the effect of the treatment on long term clinical outcome 
are controversial, particularly from the perspective of LT. As such, vasoconstrictors and albumin are not recommended in this clinical scenario
Strong
Insufficient data exist to allow TIPS to be advocated in HRS-AKI, but it could be suggested in selected patients with HRS-NAKI Weak
LT is the best therapeutic option for patients with HRS regardless of the response to drug therapy Strong
The decision to initiate RRT should be based on the individual severity of illness Weak
The indication for liver-kidney transplantation remains controversial. This procedure should be considered in patients with 
significant CKD or with sustained AKI including HRS-AKI with no response to drug therapy
Strong
Albumin (1.5 g/kg at diagnosis and 1 g/kg on day 3) should be given in patients with SBP to prevent AKI Strong
Norfloxacin (400 mg/day) should be given as prophylaxis of SBP to prevent HRS-AKI Strong

protective effect as shown by reduced incidence of 
hepatorenal syndrome in patients with cirrhosis and 
diuretic refractory ascites post-TIPS.
134
Renal replacement therapy
Renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be indicated for 
patients with AKI-HRS unresponsive to drug treatment 
and with volume overload, uremia, or electrolyte 
derangements; however, RRT does not improve 
survival in hepatorenal syndrome,138 and it should 
be reserved for use as a bridge to transplantation, 
when transplantation is an option.139 Short term 
mortality in patients with cirrhosis and AKI who are 
ineligible for transplantation approaches 90%,140 141
independently of the cause of AKI.142 Therefore, RRT 
is often futile in this setting.
Liver transplantation
The functional nature of hepatorenal syndrome 
means that improvement in renal function is 
expected with liver transplantation, which remains 
the optimal treatment of AKI-HRS whenever 
feasible.143-145 However, kidney recovery is not 
universal and is dependent on multiple factors, 
particularly duration of kidney injury.146 In such 
cases, simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation 
is recommended rather than liver transplantation 
alone. However, accurately predicting native kidney 
recovery after liver transplantation remains a 
challenge. In the US, the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network policy for simultaneous 
liver-kidney organ allocation requires sustained 
AKI defined as need for dialysis or measured or 
calculated creatinine clearance or GFR of 25 mL/min 
or below for a minimum of six consecutive weeks.147
Despite best efforts, almost 10% of patients with 
either AKI or CKD who receive a liver alone may 
have persistent or progressive renal failure after 
transplant.148 Patients with ATN are at particularly 
increased risk of chronic kidney disease (stage 
4 or 5) post-transplant, and the lack of ideal 
biomarkers often results in misdiagnosis.149 This 
has led to a consensus “safety net” for prioritization 
of liver recipients on the kidney waiting list if 
they are registered within a year after their liver 
transplant.150
Guidelines
Prevention, diagnosis, and management of hepato￾renal syndrome are included in both the American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 
and the EASL guidelines on the management of 
patients with ascites or decompensated cirrhosis 
(table 3).92 151 The AASLD guidelines were last 
updated in 2012 and do not contain the most 
up-to-date diagnostic criteria and classification 
of hepatorenal syndrome adopted in 2015. In 
contrast, the European guidelines published in 
2018 incorporate the recent changes, including 
the exclusion of a creatinine cut-off for diagnosis 
of HRS-AKI. This important change now allows for 
earlier treatment of HRS-AKI with vasoactive agents 
as discussed earlier. Another important difference 
between the two guidelines is the options for medical 
management of hepatorenal syndrome. Terlipressin 
plus albumin is considered first line treatment 
of HRS-AKI according to the EASL guidelines; 
however, terlipressin is not yet available in the US, 
and management of HRS-AKI is limited to albumin, 
octreotide plus midodrine, or norepinephrine as per 
the American guidelines.
Emerging treatments
New treatment options are urgently needed, as 
efficacy of vasoconstrictors and albumin is limited 
to less than half of patients with AKI-HRS. Serelaxin 
(recombinant human relaxin-2) is novel agent that 
acts on renal vasculature and results in increased 
renal blood flow, reduced renal vascular resistance, 
and reversal of endothelial dysfunction.152 Further￾more, serelaxin has been shown to reduce intrahepatic 
vascular resistance in animal models of cirrhosis, 
thereby ameliorating portal hypertension.153 An 
exploratory randomized phase II study showed an 
increase in total renal arterial blood flow by 65% 
in patients with compensated cirrhosis treated 
with serelaxin.154 No studies have been reported in 
patients with hepatorenal syndrome.
In addition to vasoactive drugs, treatments 
targeting systemic inflammation, including DAMPs, 
PAMPs, and downstream signaling, could be 
explored in hepatorenal syndrome. One small 
randomized study showed that pentoxifylline, a 
phosphodiesterase inhibitor with anti-TNF-α activity 
and anti-inflammatory effect, is safe in patients 
with AKI-HRS. However, the study failed to show an 
added benefit compared with standard of care alone 
(midodrine, octreotide, and albumin).155 The role of 
serelaxin and novel therapies targeting inflammation 
in the clinical management of AKI-HRS needs to be 
explored in future studies.
Conclusions
Despite advances in biomarker discovery and 
evolving definitions of hepatorenal syndrome, 
much of its pathophysiology beyond circulatory 
dysfunction still remains to be uncovered. Syste￾mic inflammation, in the presence or absence of 
infection, remains an untapped territory in the 
understanding of hepatorenal syndrome. Novel 
translational experimental models of hepatorenal 
syndrome are needed to fill this gap and, hopefully, 
will help to identify novel targets for potential drug 
development. In the meantime, emphasis should 
be on preventive measures for patients at risk of 
hepatorenal syndrome, including appropriate anti￾biotic prophylaxis and albumin use when indicated. 
For patients with established hepatorenal syndrome, 
terlipressin with albumin is considered first line 
medical treatment; however, liver transplantation 
remains the optimal treatment, and timely referral for 
transplant evaluation is crucial to avoid permanent 
kidney damage and the need for simultaneous liver 
and kidney transplant.
