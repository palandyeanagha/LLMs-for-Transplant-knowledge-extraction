Abstract
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe has established the Childhood Obesity
Surveillance Initiative (COSI) to monitor changes in overweight in primary-school children. The aims of this paper are to
present the anthropometric results of COSI Round 2 (2009/2010) and to explore changes in body mass index (BMI) and
overweight among children within and across nine countries from school years 2007/2008 to 2009/2010.
Methods: Using cross-sectional nationally representative samples of 6−9-year-olds, BMI, anthropometric Z-scores and
overweight prevalence were derived from measured weight and height. Significant changes between rounds were
assessed using variance and t-tests analyses.
Results: At Round 2, the prevalence of overweight (including obesity; WHO definitions) ranged from 18% to 57%
among boys and from 18% to 50% among girls; 6 − 31% of boys and 5 − 21% of girls were obese. Southern
European countries had the highest overweight prevalence. Between rounds, the absolute change in mean BMI
(range: from −0.4 to +0.3) and BMI-for-age Z-scores (range: from −0.21 to +0.14) varied statistically significantly
across countries. The highest significant decrease in BMI-for-age Z-scores was found in countries with higher absolute
BMI values and the highest significant increase in countries with lower BMI values. The highest significant decrease in
overweight prevalence was observed in Italy, Portugal and Slovenia and the highest significant increase in Latvia and
Norway.
Conclusions: Changes in BMI and prevalence of overweight over a two-year period varied significantly among
European countries. It may be that countries with higher prevalence of overweight in COSI Round 1 have
implemented interventions to try to remedy this situation.
Background
Through the European Charter on Counteracting Obesity,
Member States in the European Region of the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared in 2006 their
commitment to strengthen action on counteracting obes￾ity and to place this issue high on the political agenda of
their governments. Article 2.2 of the Charter states that
“Curbing the epidemic and reversing the trend are the
ultimate goal of action in the Region. Visible progress,
especially relating to children and adolescents, should be
achievable in most countries in the next 4–5 years and it
should be possible to reverse the trend by 2015 at the
latest”. Moreover, article 3.2 specifies that “A process
needs to be put together to develop internationally
comparable core indicators for inclusion in national
health surveillance systems. These data could then be
used for advocacy, policy-making and monitoring purposes.
This would also allow for regular evaluation and review of

policies and actions and for the dissemination of findings
to a wide audience” [1]. The establishment of the WHO
European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI)
in 2006 was a response to this Charter, which was signed
at the WHO European Ministerial Conference on Coun￾teracting Obesity in Istanbul, Turkey [2]. The importance
of such surveillance mechanisms was reinforced as one of
the strongest dimensions in the Vienna Declaration on
Nutrition and Noncommunicable Diseases in the Context
of Health 2020 [3], which was endorsed at the sixty-third
session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe in
September 2013 [4].
COSI routinely measures overweight and obesity preva￾lence of primary-school children aged 6–9 years, in order
to monitor progress with curbing excess body weight
in this population group and to permit inter-country
comparisons within the WHO European Region. The
first COSI data collection round took place during the
school year 2007/2008 (Round 1) in which thirteen
countries participated [5]. A second COSI data collection
round took place during the school year 2009/2010
(Round 2) and some of the participating countries have
already published the national data analyses of Round
2 [6-10].
The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to present the
findings of COSI Round 2 and investigate whether differ￾ences exist in mean values of anthropometric measure￾ments (weight, height), indices (body mass index (BMI)
and Z-scores) and prevalence estimates across countries
and between boys and girls; and 2) to assess which coun￾tries are on track to achieving the Charter’s ultimate goal
by studying the direction and magnitude of the change in
mean anthropometric values and overweight prevalence
estimates from Round 1 to Round 2.
Methods
COSI Round 2 (2009/2010) was conducted in fifteen
countries: Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway,
Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia. All Round 2 countries except for Cyprus
and Malta delivered their 2009/2010 data to the WHO￾COSI database in line with the COSI protocol and thus
data from 13 countries were used for the present analysis.
The implementation characteristics of COSI Round 1
(2007/2008) were described in detail elsewhere [5].
Protocol development
A common protocol was developed throughout 2007 by
the WHO Regional Office for Europe and Member States
participating in COSI, and it was used for both rounds
[11]. Two protocol changes in recording procedures were
made for Round 2: precise recording of the time of meas￾urement was made optional, and a mandatory variable to
indicate whether measurements took place before or
after lunch was added. In addition, children were no
longer routinely asked to go to the toilet before the
measurements [12].
Study population and sampling design
Countries that participated in Round 1 could decide for
Round 2 to select a new nationally representative sample
of schools or to go back to the same schools that were
selected in Round 1 and select randomly the classes at
these sentinel sites. Four countries (Ireland, Lithuania,
Norway and Portugal) chose the sentinel site approach.
The entire population of interest was included by Belgium
(Flanders only) and new nationally representative samples
were taken by the other eight countries (see Additional
file 1).
Age groups chosen
Given the differences among countries in school systems,
the age of children entering the first class of primary
school (reception year), and the number of children re￾peating a grade, it was difficult to implement a uniform
sampling approach that was applicable in every country.
Age was therefore taken as the first condition for the
sampling procedures. Countries were free to select one
or more of the following four defined COSI age groups:
6.0–6.9, 7.0–7.9, 8.0–8.9 or 9.0–9.9 years. Since children
of this age in all countries are enrolled in primary
schools, the school population was therefore taken to be
representative of the total population in these age groups.
Stratification
Stratification of the primary sampling unit (PSU) was
applied if it was expected that differences in anthropo￾metric measurements and indices across strata would be
observed. This was done by eight countries: the Czech
Republic by region and level of urbanization; Greece by
prefecture; Hungary by county; Italy by region; Latvia by
level of urbanization and language of instruction;
Lithuania by district and level of urbanization; Spain by
geopolitical region and size of city/village; and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by level of urbanization.
Sampling units
Cluster sampling was employed by the eight countries
that drew a new sample whereby the PSU was the primary
school or the class (except in the Czech Republic, where
the PSU was composed of paediatric clinics, since COSI
was attached to the mandatory health checks that are per￾formed by paediatricians). Primary schools and classes
were selected randomly from the list of all primary schools
(public, private and special schools) centrally available in
each country through the Ministry of Education or at the
national school registry (or national list of primary care
Wijnhoven et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:806 Page 2 of 16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/806

paediatricians). If less than about 1% of the target children
were enrolled in private or special schools (e.g. schools for
children with learning disability or visual impairment),
countries had the choice of excluding these schools from
the sampling frame. If the majority of the children of the
targeted age group were in the same grade, then the class
was drawn from within that grade level. If the targeted age
group was spread across grades, however, all grades where
most children from this age group were present were sam￾pled. In every sampled class, all children were invited to
participate.
Sample size
Rudolf et al. suggest using the standard deviation (SD)
scores or Z-scores of a BMI distribution to demonstrate
whether a halt in the rise in overweight or obesity is
achieved [13]. The calculated sample size of ≈ 2300
children per age group was based on an 80% power to
detect a minimum difference of 0.10 Z-score in mean
BMI per year at a two-sided 5% significance level. To
achieve the same precision with a cluster sample design as
with a simple random sample, the minimum final effective
sample size should be ≈ 2800 children per age group,
whereby a design effect of 1.2 was applied [14]. Additional
file 2 shows by country the number of children that were
invited to participate in Round 2; that were measured; that
had complete information on age, sex, weight and height;
and that fell within the targeted age group. A total of 224
920 children aged 6–9 years were included in the data
analyses (114 457 boys and 110 463 girls).
Data collection procedures
Countries decided on the measurement period. Data
collection, however, was avoided during the first two
weeks of a school term or immediately after a major
holiday. Taking the local arrangements, circumstances and
budget into account, countries chose the most appropriate
professionals to collect data from the children, hereafter
called examiners. Additional file 3 gives a summary of the
application of the COSI protocol characteristics in each
country in Round 2.
Ethics approval procedures
The COSI protocol is in accordance with the international
Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving
Human Subjects [15]. Depending on local circumstances,
the procedures were also approved by local ethical com￾mittees. This was not needed in four countries because
data collection procedures were part of legislation
(Belgium), a compulsory school programme (Slovenia),
a National Annual Program of Public Health (the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) or were regulated by the
National Health Authority and Regional Health Authorities
(Spain). The local committees in the other nine countries
were: Czech Republic: the Institutional Ethical Committee
of the Institute of Endocrinology; Greece: the Ethics
Committee of the Alexander Technological Educational
Institute of Thessaloniki; Hungary: the Scientific and
Research Ethics Committee of the Medical Research
Council; Ireland: the Research Ethics Committee of the
University College Dublin; Italy: the Institutional Ethical
Committee of the Italian National Institute of Health;
Latvia: Central Medical Ethics Committee; Lithuania:
Lithuanian Bioethics Committee; Norway: Regional Com￾mittee for Medical and Health Research Ethics; and
Portugal: Portuguese Data Protection Authority. Detailed
information on the ethical clearance procedures in each
country is included in Additional file 4. Parents were
always fully informed about all study procedures and their
informed consent approach (passive or active by one or
two parents) was obtained. Children’s consent was always
obtained prior to the measurements.
Anthropometric measurements
Prior to data collection, all examiners were trained in
measuring weight and height using WHO standardized
techniques [16]. Children were asked to take off their
shoes and socks as well as all heavy clothing (coats,
sweaters, jackets, etc.) and to remove items such as
wallets, mobile phones or key chains. Body weight was
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg with portable digital
(mainly manufacturer-calibrated) scales and body
height was measured standing upright to the nearest
0.1 cm with portable stadiometers. Body weight was
then adjusted for the weight of the clothes worn. The
average weights of types of clothing were provided by each
country. Where possible, the same anthropometric equip￾ment was used throughout a country. Anthropometric
measurements were preferably done in the mornings before
lunch time, although this had not always been feasible.
Data elaboration
All country datasets were reviewed in a standard manner
at the Regional Office for inconsistencies and completeness
before they were merged for the intercountry analyses. The
final dataset included children with informed consent and
complete information on age, sex, weight and height.
Children were excluded from the final dataset if their
age did not fall within the targeted age group.
The child’s age (in years) was calculated using the for￾mula: (date of measurement minus date of birth (expressed
in days))/365.25. When a complete date of birth was not
provided but only the month and year of birth, then the
child’s age (in years) was calculated by dividing the number
of months between the date of birth and the date of
measurement by 12 (this was done for the entire Belgian
dataset). BMI was calculated using the formula: weight
(kg) divided by height squared (m2
).

The 2007 WHO recommended cut-offs for school-age
children and adolescents were used to compute height￾for-age (H/A), weight-for-age (W/A) and BMI-for-age
(BMI/A) Z-scores, and to interpret anthropometric
indicators [17,18], whereby stunting and severe stunting
were defined as the proportion of children with a H/A
value below −2 Z-scores and below −3 Z-scores, respect￾ively, relative to the 2007 WHO growth reference median
[17]. Underweight and severe underweight were defined
as the proportion of children with a W/A value below −2
Z-scores and below −3 Z-scores, respectively. Thinness
and severe thinness were defined as the proportion of chil￾dren with a BMI/A value below −2 Z-scores and below −3
Z-scores, respectively. Overweight and obesity were de￾fined as the proportion of children with a BMI/A value
above +1 Z-score and above +2 Z-scores, respectively.
Overweight and obesity were also estimated using the
IOTF cut-off points [19], as they are widely used in the
WHO European Region (see Additional file 5).
According to WHO definitions, the prevalence estimates
for stunted children include those who are severely stunted,
the prevalence estimates for underweight children include
those who are severely underweight, the prevalence esti￾mates for thin children include those who are severely
thin, and the prevalence estimates for overweight children
include those who are obese [16].
Children with biologically implausible (or extreme)
values were excluded from the analysis [18]: W/A values
below −6 or above +5 Z-scores; H/A values below −6
or above +6 Z-scores; and BMI/A values below −5 or
above +5 Z-scores relative to the 2007 WHO growth
reference median.
Statistical analysis
A P-value of 0.05 was used to define statistical signifi￾cance. All statistical analyses, except the Games-Howell
post hoc tests, were performed in Stata version 10.1
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The latter was
performed in SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Round 2
Sampling weights to adjust for the applied sampling
design, oversampling and non-response rate of Round 2
were available for only four countries. For the other
countries, these could not be calculated for various reasons.
For instance, the registration of the children in schools and
classes was not entirely complete. Hence, the analyses were
performed unweighted. Means ± SDs were calculated for
all measurements (weight and height) and anthropometric
indices (BMI, W/A, H/A and BMI/A Z-scores) by age
group, sex and country. For each country-specific dataset,
these six continuous variables were tested by age group
for normality using normal quantile–quantile plots. Weight
and BMI were found to be highly positively skewed in all
datasets. They were therefore transformed to attain
normality and their transformed values were used for the
intercountry comparisons. Using the command ‘ladder’ in
Stata, the best option suggested was inverse transform￾ation for weight and 1/square transformation for BMI for
the majority of the datasets. Although the distribution of
W/A and BMI/A Z-scores was also skewed to the right,
the command ‘ladder’ showed no need to apply transfor￾mations to normalize them.
The homogeneity of variances was tested using Levene’s
test [20]. Since the data showed heterogeneity of variances
between countries and because of an unbalanced design
(unequal group sizes), the main effects of country and sex
and their interaction on all mean anthropometric values
was assessed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
with the Games-Howell post hoc test for the multiple com￾parisons between countries [21]. This was done separately
for all age groups because not every country had included
all age groups. In the case of an interaction effect, a
one-way ANOVA was performed to assess significant
differences across countries by sex and between sexes
by country for all four age groups.
Prevalence estimates are presented as percentages.
Within each age group, the chi-squared test was used to
determine differences in the prevalence estimates across
countries for the total group and for boys and girls
separately. If the chi-squared test was found significant,
the Marascuilo procedure was used for the multi-group
comparisons of proportions between countries [22]. In
addition a chi-squared test was used to determine the
statistical significance of differences in the prevalence esti￾mates between boys and girls within each age group as well
as to assess a linear trend in the prevalence estimates with
increasing age for the seven countries with multiple age
groups selected (Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania,
Slovenia and Spain).
Changes from Round 1 to Round 2
The absolute change in mean values for all measurements
(weight and height) and anthropometric indices (BMI,
W/A, H/A and BMI/A Z-scores) was calculated for the
nine countries that participated in both rounds (Belgium,
Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway,
Portugal and Slovenia), by age group and sex. A two-way
ANOVA was applied to assess the interaction effect of
country and round on all mean anthropometric values, for
boys and girls separately. In the case of no significant
interaction effect, two-way ANOVA without the inter￾action term (additive model) was performed to assess the
main effects of country and round on the values. By age
group and for boys and girls separately, Levene’s test [20]
was applied to assess the homogeneity of variances be￾tween the two rounds. If a significant interaction effect
was found by the two-way ANOVA, the unpaired t-test
Wijnhoven et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:806 Page 4 of 16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/806

(equal variance) or the unpaired Welch’s t-test (unequal
variance) was performed to assess whether the difference
in mean values between the two rounds in each country
was statistically significant.
A z test for two independent proportions was used to
determine the statistical significance of differences in the
prevalence estimates between the two rounds by country
and age group.
Results
COSI Round 2 (2009/2010)
Weight, height, BMI, W/A, H/A and BMI/A Z-scores
Mean values for weight and W/A Z-score are presented
in Table 1, mean values for height and H/A Z-score in
Table 2 and mean values for BMI and BMI/A Z-score in
Table 3. All mean Z-scores were positive. Weight and
height increased with age and boys were taller and heavier
than girls in all age groups (where statistically significant
differences between boys and girls were found). Based on
the values found in countries that targeted multiple age
groups, BMI also increased with age (except in Italian
girls). Mean BMI/A Z-scores close to the +1 Z-score
curve values of the 2007 WHO growth reference were
found in three countries (Greece, Italy and Spain). Median
values of weight and BMI are available in Additional file 6.
Two-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant
interaction effect of country and sex on most anthropo￾metric values (BMI/A Z-score for each of the four age
groups (P < 0.05); inverse-transformed weight (P < 0.001),
W/A Z-score (P < 0.0001) and 1/square-transformed BMI
(P < 0.0001) for the 7-, 8- and 9-year-old groups; H/A
Z-score for the 8-year-old group (P < 0.05) and height
for the 8- and 9-year-old groups (P < 0.05)). Because
significant results were found in all age groups, one-way
ANOVA analyses were performed to assess within each
age group the country effect for boys and girls separately
and the sex effect for each country separately. Results
from the one-way ANOVA analyses are also presented in
Tables 1, 2 and 3. The main effect of country (P < 0.0001)
on all mean values and the main effect of sex (P < 0.05) on
most mean values were statistically significant. Subse￾quently, Games-Howell post hoc tests were performed for
boys and girls separately within each age group to study the
differences between countries in more detail (countries
within each sex-age group that share the same superscript
letter do not statistically significantly differ from each
other).
Based on mean BMI/A Z-score values, three categories
of countries could be determined. One group of countries
(Belgium, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and
Norway) consistently had values (in both boys and girls as
well as in multiple age groups when applicable) between
the expected 2007 WHO growth reference value and 0.5
SD away from this reference median value. A second
group of countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain)
consistently had values more than 0.5 SD away from the
2007 WHO growth reference median. The third group
consisted of countries that could not easily be catego￾rized in one of these two groups, because the mean
BMI/A Z-score value of boys was more than 0.5 SD
while the value of girls was less than 0.5 SD away from
the median of the growth reference population (the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) or the values
differed across age groups (Ireland and Slovenia).
Prevalence of stunting, underweight and thinness
Stunting, underweight and thinness were rare in all
countries. Most values for severe stunting, severe under￾weight and severe thinness were below 0.2%. All values for
stunting and underweight and most values for thinness
were below 2.3%. Values for thinness greater than 2.3%,
but still close to what is expected in a normally distributed
population, were found in Lithuanian 9-year-old girls
(3.2%), Slovenian 6-year-old boys (3.1%), Slovenian 7-
year-old boys (2.9%) and girls (2.4%) and 7-year-old
boys and girls (both 2.5%) of the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia.
Prevalence of overweight and obesity
Table 4 presents the proportions of overweight and
obese boys and girls in each age group and country,
based on both the WHO and IOTF definitions. In the
six countries with a mean BMI/A Z-score value between
the expected reference median value and 0.5 SD away
from this value, the prevalence of overweight (including
obesity and based on WHO definitions) varied from 18%
to 29% (IOTF: 11 − 19%) in boys and from 18% to 28%
(IOTF: 15 − 24%) in girls, and the prevalence of obesity
varied from 6% to 14% (IOTF: 3 − 7%) in boys and from
5% to 10% (IOTF: 4 − 8%) in girls. In the four countries
with BMI/A Z-score values more than 0.5 SD away from
the 2007 WHO growth reference median, the prevalence
of overweight varied from 32% to 57% (IOTF: 23 − 45%)
in boys and from 35% to 50% (IOTF: 30 − 42%) in girls,
whereas the prevalence of obesity varied from 14% to
31% (IOTF: 8 − 15%) in boys and from 12% to 21%
(IOTF: 8 − 15%) in girls.
The chi-squared test comparing the prevalence esti￾mates across countries was significant for all age groups
(P < 0.001 for boys and girls separately). The Marascuilo
procedure was then used to study country differences
for each age group (see Table 4; countries within each
sex-age group that share the same superscript letter do
not statistically significantly differ from each other).
Based on WHO definitions, the observed linear in￾creasing trend in the prevalence of overweight with
increasing age was significant for Belgian boys and girls
(both P < 0.001), Greek boys (P < 0.001) and girls (P < 0.01),
Wijnhoven et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:806 Page 5 of 16

Irish boys (P < 0.05), Slovenian boys and girls (both
P < 0.001) and Spanish boys (P < 0.001) and girls (P < 0.01).
The increasing obesity trend with increasing age was
significant in Belgian boys and girls (both P < 0.001),
Greek boys (P < 0.001), Slovenian boys and girls (both
P < 0.001) and Spanish boys (P = 0.001). The observed

Changes from COSI Round 1 (2007/2008) to COSI Round 2
(2009/2010)
The absolute change in mean values of weight, height
and BMI from Round 1 to Round 2 is presented in
Table 5 and the absolute change in mean values of W/A,
H/A and BMI/A Z-score in Table 6. The direction
(increase, decrease or no change) and magnitude of this
change differed by country, which is shown by the results
of the two-way ANOVA with interaction (country*round).
This analysis showed statistically significant results for
almost all mean values of BMI (Table 5) and BMI/A
Z-score (Table 6). Two-way ANOVA using the additive
model was then applied for the mean values with no
statistical significant interaction effect. The main effect
of country (P < 0.0001) on all these values except for
weight in 9-year-old girls were statistically significant.
The main effect of data collection round (P < 0.05) on
all weight, BMI and BMI/A Z-score values as well as on
one W/A Z-score (6-year-old boys) and some H/A Z-score
(7-year-old boys and 9-year-old girls) values were statisti￾cally significant. The unpaired t-test showed statistically
significant difference in the change in mean values between
the two rounds in some age-sex groups in some countries.
When this difference was statistically significant for both
boys and girls, the direction of the change was the same
for both sexes.
The absolute change in overweight and obesity preva￾lence estimates (based on WHO definitions [17]) from
Round 1 to Round 2 is presented in Table 7. The preva￾lence of overweight (including obesity) statistically sig￾nificantly decreased in Belgian 6-year-old boys, Italian
8-year-old boys and girls, Italian 9-year-old boys,
Portuguese 7-year-old boys, Slovenian 6- and 7-year-old
boys and Slovenian 7-year-old girls. A statistically sig￾nificant absolute increase in overweight prevalence
was observed in Latvian 7-year-old girls and Norwegian
8-year-old boys. The prevalence of obesity statistically
significantly decreased in Italian 8-year-old boys, Italian
9-year-old boys and girls and Slovenian 7-year-old boys.
A statistically significant absolute increase in obesity
prevalence was observed in Latvian 7-year-old boys and
girls and Norwegian 8-year-old boys.
Discussion
COSI Round 2 (2009/2010)
When adjusting weight (Table 1) and height (Table 2)
for age, positive W/A and H/A Z-score values were found
in all countries. This means that the country values were
higher than the population median values of the 2007
WHO growth reference [17] and thus the COSI children
were heavier and taller than the reference population.
All country mean BMI/A Z-score values (Table 3)
were positive − thus higher than the 2007 WHO growth
reference population [17] − but varied largely among the
countries. Grouping of countries on the basis of having or
not having a mean value of 0.5 SD away from the refer￾ence median suggests the presence of a north–south
gradient with the highest BMI/A Z-score values found
in southern European countries. Categorization of coun￾tries based on prevalence estimates (regardless of WHO
or IOTF definitions) showed similar groups of countries.
These findings also suggest the presence of a north–south
gradient with the highest overweight and obesity preva￾lence estimates noted in southern European countries. A
north–south gradient was also observed in COSI Round 1
[5] as well as in other European-wide studies carried out
among adolescents in 2010 [23,24].
Possible explanations for the apparent north–south
gradient remain unclear. Studies carried out in European
children [25] and adolescents [26] suggest that shortness
(low H/A) might be one of the explanations. The mean
H/A Z-score values found in Italy, Portugal and Spain
(but not those in Greece) were indeed significantly lower
(but still higher than the growth reference values) than
the values of almost all other countries. Other suggested
explanations concern, among others, birth weight [27,28],
sleep duration [29], dietary [23] or physical activity pat￾terns [23], which seem to vary among children by country
or subregion in Europe as well. To what extent these vari￾ables can explain the overweight north–south gradient
found in COSI surveys would need to be explored further.
Information was collected by some COSI countries and
will be published elsewhere.
Stunting, thinness and underweight were rare among
the 6 − 9-year-olds in any of the COSI countries. It is,
however, uncertain whether these results found in the
COSI countries can be generalized to the entire WHO
European Region because no comparable studies in
other countries could be found that collected data on
these indicators for the same age range in 2009 or later.
But studies done among younger children (0 − 5-year-olds)
showed that stunting is considerable in some countries in
the WHO European Region (Armenia, 19.3% overall and
36.5% in Syunik [30]; Bosnia and Herzegovina, 8.9% overall
and 9.9% in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
[31]; Kazakhstan, 13.1% overall and 36.2% in Aktobe
Oblast [32]; Serbia, 6.6% overall and 8.3% in Belgrade
[33]; and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
4.9% overall and 13.3% in southwest region [34] (based
on measured weight and height and the 2006 WHO
child growth standards [35]).
Changes from COSI Round 1 (2007/2008) to Round 2
(2009/2010)
In two years, the change within country in mean weight
varied from a decrease of −0.9 kg to an increase of +0.6 kg
and the change in mean height varied from a decrease
of −1.0 cm to an increase of +0.6 cm (Table 5). The

observed range of the country weight and height differences
is nevertheless plausible. No statistically significant variation
in the change in mean W/A Z-score and H/A Z-score
values was found across the countries in most age groups
(Table 6), which suggest the presence of the same weight
and height (adjusted for age) developments in the COSI
countries. This was not the case for BMI.
The absolute change in mean BMI ranged from a
statistically significant decrease of −0.4 kg/m2 (Italy and
Portugal) to a statistically significant increase of +0.3 kg/m2
(Norway). There was variation in the change in mean BMI
across the countries in the 6-, 7- and 8-year-old age groups
and the variation remained statistically significant when
BMI was adjusted for age (Table 6). A significant decrease
of 0.10 BMI/A Z-score per year was observed in
Portuguese boys. Interestingly, a statistically significant
decrease was observed in southern European countries
with higher absolute BMI/A Z-scores (Italy, Portugal and
Slovenia) and an increase in the group of countries with
lower absolute BMI/A Z-score values (Czech Republic
and Norway). Countries with higher prevalence of
overweight in Round 1 (e.g. Italy and Portugal) [5]
showed a decrease in prevalence (but still had among
the highest estimates in Round 2), and the country with
lower prevalence in Round 1 (e.g. Latvia and Norway) [5]
showed an increase in prevalence (but still had a lower
estimate than the countries that showed the highest
decrease from Round 1 to Round 2). Changes could only

be assessed for nine COSI countries and the statistically
significant results suggest different developments in these
countries, hence, a conclusion about the overall pattern
(increase or decrease) for the entire WHO European
Region (53 Member States) cannot be drawn.
Strengths
COSI requires the inclusion of national samples (unless a
country’s political system is decentralized like, for instance,
in Belgium), and the children are selected from the school
population, which is presumed to be representative of the
total population for the 6-, 7-, 8- and 9-year-olds.
COSI provides a unique large dataset with a total
number of more than 168 000 children with valid
measurements in Round 1 [5] and about 220 000 children
in Round 2. It is expected that the number of children will
increase in each future COSI round because four new
countries (Albania, Republic of Moldova, Romania and
Turkey) participated in the third COSI data collection
round (2012/2013) and other countries may follow
by joining the fourth round during the school year
2015/2016.
The standardized weight and height measurements in
a large number of countries and the application of a
consistent data collection protocol enabled the use of mul￾tiple comparisons (Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4), and the repeated
COSI rounds made it possible to assess the changes over
time (Tables 5, 6 and 7).

Limitations
Some differences in sample size achieved might have
influenced the results. Seven countries in Round 2 did
not obtain a final sample of children that contained
more than 60% of the approached children and fell
within the targeted age group, while eight countries
did not achieve the minimum final effective sample
size of ≈ 2800 children per age group (see Additional
file 2). However, Table 6 showed that all difference
values of BMI/A Z-score higher than 0.05 per year were
already statistically significant, which suggest that the COSI
data have sufficient power to detect a significant difference
of 0.10 per year if it really existed (on which sample size
calculation for COSI was based – see Methods section).
This also means that it is almost certain that a real change
of 0.10 BMI/A Z-score per year did not happen in the
COSI countries where no statistically significant changes
were found.
The analyses were performed unweighted, because
sampling weights to adjust for the applied sampling
design, oversampling and non-response rate were avail￾able for only three countries in Round 1 [5] and four
countries in Round 2. This was mainly due to the in￾complete registration of all children in the schools and
classes. We do not know the effect of the unweighted
analyses on the results, but we would expect this to be
limited due to the nationally representative sampling of
children.
In an optimal study design, the same scales and stadi￾ometers should be used with similar and adequate calibra￾tion procedures. For the majority of the countries, the
same equipment was used throughout the country, but
data comparability would have been improved if identical
equipment would have been used by each country. This
was not set as mandatory in the COSI protocol, largely
because of cost implications. The monitoring of data qual￾ity procedures, however, was stressed throughout the
measurement period.
Conclusions
The WHO COSI includes repeated data collection
rounds in 2 − 3-year intervals in order to assess changes
in weight, height and BMI as well as in overweight and
obesity prevalence estimates. The results show that with
the present COSI data it is possible to detect relevant
changes between rounds. A period of two years, with
just two rounds of data collection, is, however, inad￾equate to identify clear trends within countries. Hence,
continuation of the surveys will be important to evaluate
the currently observed changes over a longer period.
These changes varied significantly across the countries
and showed little decline. All countries will thus need to
strengthen their efforts in order to become on track with
achieving the European Charter’s goal to reverse the
obesity epidemic by 2015 [1]. Furthermore, it seems that
active implementation of policies or interventions to
counteract overweight and obesity have been triggered
more by the countries with higher values in Round 1
than by the countries with lower values. It could be that
the latter group of countries did not see the urgency to
keep their values stable and thus to introduce overweight
preventive interventions targeting school-aged children
for this purpose.
