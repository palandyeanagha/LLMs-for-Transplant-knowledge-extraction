Abstract
Objective: Impaired liver regeneration is associated with a poor outcome in patients with decompensated alcoholic liver
disease (ALD). We assessed whether autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation (BMMCT) improved liver
function in decompensated ALD.
Design: 58 patients (mean age 54 yrs; mean MELD score 19, all with cirrhosis, 81% with alcoholic steatohepatitis at baseline
liver biopsy) were randomized early after hospital admission to standard medical therapy (SMT) alone (n = 30), including
steroids in patients with a Maddrey’s score $32, or combined with G-CSF injections and autologous BMMCT into the
hepatic artery (n = 28). Bone marrow cells were harvested, isolated and reinfused the same day. The primary endpoint was a
$3 points decrease in the MELD score at 3 months, corresponding to a clinically relevant improvement in liver function.
Liver biopsy was repeated at week 4 to assess changes in Ki67+/CK7+ hepatic progenitor cells (HPC) compartment.
Results: Both study groups were comparable at baseline. After 3 months, 2 and 4 patients died in the BMMCT and SMT
groups, respectively. Adverse events were equally distributed between groups. Moderate alcohol relapse occurred in 31% of
patients. The MELD score improved in parallel in both groups during follow-up with 18 patients (64%) from the BMMCT
group and 18 patients (53%) from the SMT group reaching the primary endpoint (p = 0.43 (OR 1.6, CI 0.49–5.4) in an
intention to treat analysis. Comparing liver biopsy at 4 weeks to baseline, steatosis improved (p,0.001), and proliferating
HPC tended to decrease in both groups (235 and 233%, respectively).
Conclusion: Autologous BMMCT, compared to SMT is a safe procedure but did not result in an expanded HPC compartment
or improved liver function. These data suggest either insufficient regenerative stimulation after BMMCT or resistance to liver
regenerative drive in patients with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis.

Introduction
Decompensated alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in non-abstinent
patients, often called alcoholic hepatitis, is a common cause of
acute-on-chronic liver failure [1] with a poor outcome [2,3]. This
clinical syndrome of a recent onset of jaundice and/or ascites in a
patient with ongoing alcohol misuse has been recently acknowl￾edged in the EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on alcoholic liver
disease [4]. When available, liver biopsy will show steatohepatitis
(ASH) in 70–90% of these patients [5]. The remaining 10–30% of
decompensation episodes may be related to other causes,
dominated by infection [6]. This clinical syndrome is also included
in the definition of acute-on-chronic liver failure [1,7] [8], in
which patients’ outcome can be reliably assessed using severity
scores including the MELD, a prognostic indicator initially created
to predict survival after portal decompression by transjugular
porto-systemic shunt [9]. The MELD score ranges from 6 (normal
liver function) to 40 (severe liver failure). Although survival in
severe, biopsy-proven ASH is improved by corticosteroids,
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53719

significant mortality is observed in patients who are not eligible to
steroids because of lack of access to transvenous liver biopsy and
proven ASH, have ‘‘non-severe’’ ASH, or do not respond to
steroids [2]. As no treatment has demonstrated superiority over
steroids until now, and liver transplantation is not an option for
most of these patients, alternative therapies are needed.
Impaired liver regeneration seems to be common to situations of
ongoing liver failure. Clinically, prolonged periods of severe
jaundice, low coagulation factors and clinically significant portal
hypertension put these patients at risk of complications. On liver
biopsies of patients with ASH, hepatic progenitor cells (HPC)
expansion correlates with disease severity and mortality [10].
It has been proposed that pluripotent non-haematopoietic stem
cells originating from the bone marrow may participate in the
repopulation of a damaged liver and may improve its function
[11]. Experimental studies in acute severe liver injury coupled with
hepatocyte replication impairment suggest that regeneration
derives partly from bone marrow cells and improves survival
[12,13]. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilizes
bone marrow cells and improves liver regeneration by stimulating
oval cell proliferation and bone marrow cell engraftment in a rat
model of liver injury [14]. We have demonstrated that G-CSF is
well tolerated in patients with decompensated ALD and increases
proliferative activity of both hepatic progenitor cells and mature
hepatocytes in the short term [15]. A survival benefit has been
recently demonstrated following repeated G-CSF administration
in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, some of which were
related to alcohol overuse [16]. The combination of mobilization,
isolation, and direct infusion of bone marrow stem cells into the
liver via the hepatic artery or the portal vein, or, alternatively,
autologous human bone marrow stem cell transplantation, showed
inconstant improvement in liver function. However, the majority
of these trials have either included a limited number of patients,
lacked appropriate control groups or were heterogeneous in their
design and methods of stem cell therapy (reviewed in references
[13,17]). Therefore, tolerance, possible influence on liver fibrosis
[18], potential benefits and mechanisms associated with bone
marrow cell therapy in advanced liver disease and in particular in
decompensated ALD characterized by an impaired liver regener￾ation [19], remain to be determined.
In order to test whether bone marrow cells mobilized and
infused into the liver enhance hepatocyte proliferation and result
in improved liver function over a 3-months period, we designed a
pragmatic, prospective randomized trial in clinically decompen￾sated ALD, comparing standard medical therapy (SMT) alone
versus SMT combined with bone marrow mononuclear cell
mobilization and infusion into the hepatic artery, reported as bone
marrow mononuclear cell transplantation (BMMCT).
Patients and Methods
Patients
From February 2008 to March 2011, all patients admitted to
our hospital for decompensated ALD were considered eligible if
they met the following criteria: (i) clinical decompensation
manifested by ascites and/or jaundice in active drinkers ($80 g/
day of alcohol); (ii) a liver biopsy performed within 7 days of
admission; (iii) age 18 to 75 yrs; (iiii) MELD score ,26; and (v)
written informed consent to participate. Exclusion criteria
included pregnancy, hepatitis B, C or HIV, documented
hepatocellular carcinoma, biliary tract obstruction, liver biopsy
showing causes other than ALD for decompensation, complete
portal vein thrombosis, hypersensitivity to G-CSF, severe coagu￾lopathy (platelets ,50 G/l+INR .1.5), serum creatinine
.150 umol/l, any ongoing infection, recent (,10 days) gastroin￾testinal bleed, estimated survival ,6 months and clinically overt
hepatic encephalopathy. High creatinine serum level and severe
coagulopathy were considered exclusion criteria due to the risk of,
a) further deterioration of renal function with the use of contrast
media during angiography, and b) major bleeding during bone
marrow aspiration and femoral artery catheterization.
Methods
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist
are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and
Protocol S1.
Design of the Trial
This randomized controlled trial (trial number: http://www.
controlled-trial.com/ISRCTN83972743) was conducted in a
single tertiary care centre (Geneva University Hospitals), and
designed to compare SMT alone or combined with autologous
BMMCT to improve liver function in decompensated ALD
(figure 1 illustrates the flowchart according to CONSORT
guidelines). Allocation to each treatment group was performed
using a computer generated randomization code inserted in
sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The primary endpoint
was an improved liver function at 90 days of follow-up, as defined
by a decrease in the MELD score of at least 3 points as compared
to baseline value. Based on our clinical experience, a decrease of at
least 3 points from baseline MELD corresponds to a clinically
relevant improvement in liver function and prognosis. To the
contrary, an increase in MELD score within weeks of admission is
associated with a poorer in-hospital mortality in patients with ASH
[8]. The follow-up of 3 months was chosen based on the definition
of acute-on-chronic liver failure [1] and on previous studies on
bone marrow cell therapy [20–21] reporting improvement in liver
function parameters during this observation period. Secondary
endpoints included safety and evolution of parameters associated
with liver regeneration and inflammation, including serum
cytokines and liver tissues studies.
Shortly after hospital admission, all patients with decompensat￾ed liver disease suspected to be related to alcohol had a liver biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis of ALD and to guide steroid therapy in
cases of severe, histologically-proven ASH. Imaging studies were
performed to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary tract
obstruction. Particular attention was paid to detecting infection by
cultivating ascites, urine, and blood, and by performing a chest
radiograph, as recommended [4]. At time of randomization,
peripheral blood samples were drawn for cytokines and blood
markers of liver regeneration. Patients then received either SMT
alone (including vitamin B supplements, stimulation of calorie
intake, specialized support regarding alcohol abstinence but no
pharmacological intervention, and a 4-week course of prednisone
40 mg/day in case of severe ASH, as defined by a Maddrey’s score
$32 [2]) or SMT in combination with autologous BMMCT.
Liver Tissue Studies
Both baseline and repeat liver biopsies were performed via the
transjugular route under light sedation and hepatic hemodynamic
measurements were performed as described [22]. In all cases, the
size of liver biopsy specimen was sufficient for an accurate
histological diagnosis.
Light microscopy. The liver biopsy specimen was immedi￾ately placed into formalin, then fixed and embedded, and
processed for light microscopy. Serial sections 4 mm thick were
stained with haematoxylin-eosin, reticulin and Masson Trichrome,
Bone Marrow Cell Therapy in Alcoholic Cirrhosis

and histological study was performed by an expert in liver disease
(LRB) unaware of patients’ characteristics and treatment alloca￾tion. The entire biopsy specimen was examined by using 20–50
high-power fields (x 400) as previously described [15,22].
Histological lesions common in ALD were analyzed in a blinded
manner. Thus, we performed a semi-quantitative scoring of
steatosis, portal and lobular inflammation, ballooning degenera￾tion of hepatocyte, using the NAS score [23], but not fibrosis as all
patients had cirrhosis. We also assessed the intensity of ductular
reaction, thought to represent the compartment where hepatocyte
and cholangiocyte progenitors expand in response to proliferation
stimuli [24], using a semi-quantitative score (absent: 0; focal: 1;
clusters ,50% of microscopic fields: 2; clusters .50% of
microscopic fields: 3).
Immunohistochemistry. We used a double immunohisto￾chemistry staining method on liver tissue specimens to determine
the number of proliferating cells in the ductular reaction [24]. To
achieve this, we determined the number both of hepatic
progenitors and intermediate hepatocytes according to morpho￾logical features and immunoreactivity against both cytokeratin 7
and the proliferation marker Ki67, as described [15,25].
Immunohistochemical staining was performed in serial 3- to 5-
mm-thick unstained sections from the tissue block, using the mouse
monoclonal human antibody MiB1 against the proliferation
marker Ki67 (1:20 dilution) and the CK7 (1:50 dilution) (Dako
Cytomation, Zug, Switzerland). The preparation of slides was
carried out as previously described [15]. Then, the whole biopsy
specimen was analyzed under high magnification (x 400) and the
HPC and intermediate hepatocytes that demonstrated double
immunostaining were manually counted. Results are given as the
mean number of cells per high-power fields.
Cytokines and Blood Markers of Regeneration
We used a multiplex suspension array technique based on the
sandwich immunoassay method (Bioplex, Biorad, Zu¨rich, Swit￾zerland) for multiple measurements on a single plasma sample
[26]. This microsphere-based technology was applied for the
dosage of TNFa (TNF), the soluble form of receptor-1 for TNFa
(sTNFR1), and interleukin-6 (IL6), representative of inflammatory
changes, and alfa-foetoprotein (AFP), hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) as markers
associated with liver [27,28]. All measurements were performed on
plasma samples obtained after immediate centrifugation of blood
drawn in a fasting state, and immediately stored at -80uC until use.
Cytokines concentrations were determined using commercially
available immunoassays (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK; Millipore,
Saint Charles, MO, USA), with a detection limit of 5.5, 1.2, and
1.5 pg/ml, for TNF, sTNFR1 and IL6, respectively, and 40 pg/
ml, 1.3 ng/ml, and 15.5 pg/ml for HGF, AFP, and TGFb,
respectively. Inflammation was therefore monitored using changes
in TNF, sTNFR1 and IL6 plasma values, while liver regeneration
was evaluated by the evolution of circulating levels of HGF, AFP
as well as TGFb as cytokines involved in hepatocyte proliferation
[29].
Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation
Patients allocated to the BMMCT arm received a 5-day course
of lenograstim (G-CSF, Granocyte, SANOFI Aventis, Meyrin,
Geneva) to mobilize bone marrow cells at a dose of 10 mg/kg per
day subcutaneously. On day 5 the bone marrow aspiration
procedure was performed under propofol sedation. A mean
volume of 103618 ml of bone marrow was collected from the
posterior iliac crest in bags containing 2500 IU heparin. Cell
suspensions were immediately centrifuged (3000 rpm at 20uC for 7
minutes) over a Ficoll-Hypaque plus (GE-Healthcare, Uppsala,

Sweden) gradient and mononuclear cells (MNC) recovered at the
interface. Cells were washed twice with 140 mM NaCl containing
25% of hu-Albumin CSL 5% (Behring AG, Bern, Switzerland)
and then suspended in 40 ml of human Albumin CSL 5% 1:1
containing 10 U/ml of heparin, and transferred in a 400 ml
infusion pouch. Analytical samples were taken to assess total
nucleated cell count, haematopoietic colony forming unit (CFU)
frequency, CD34+ cell frequency and mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC) frequency. The CFU assay for MSC was read after 14 days
of culture in methocult medium (Stem Cell Technologies,
Grenoble, France), as previously described [30]. CD34 expression
was performed on a FACScalibur (Beckton-Dickinson, Mountain
View, CA) using the ISAGE dual platform protocol, and MSC
frequency was determined after 10 days of culture by limiting
dilution analysis using the Poisson statistical distribution. Due to
the high viability rate of bone marrow MNC and the time
schedule for autologous transplantation, no viability test was
performed. The mean time between bone marrow aspiration and
cell infusion was 5.961.2 hours. Under light sedation (propofol
20–50 mg IV), digestive angiography was performed by trained
radiologists (ST, RB), and cells were slowly infused over 5 minutes
into the proper hepatic artery through a 5F catheter (Terumo
Glidecath, Leuven, Belgium). No contrast media was administered
during or following cell infusion to avoid osmotic cell injury.
Observation Period
The follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 2 and 3 months after
randomization. In addition to clinical and biological evaluations,
alcohol consumption was monitored using blood ethanol levels at
every follow-up visits. All adverse events were graded as mild,
average or severe and classified according to Common Terminol￾ogy Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
Ethical Considerations
A written informed consent was obtained from each patient.
The study protocol was in accordance with International
Committee for Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice (ICH/
GCP) and approved both by our institution Ethics Committee
(Comite´ De´partemental d’Ethique de Me´decine Interne et
Me´decine Communautaire des Hoˆpitaux Universitaires de
Gene`ve, Protocole # 07–145) and by the Swiss regulatory
authorities (SwissMedic, Institut Suisse des Produits The´rapeu￾tiques, Bern, Switzerland, Protocole # 2008DR2031).
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
To achieve a statistical power of 85% at 5% type I error, with
the initial assumption that the primary endpoint will be reached in
60% of BMMCT-treated patients and 20% in patients on SMT
alone, a sample size of 26 patients in each arm was calculated.
Assuming a 10% of included patients lost to follow-up, a sample of
60 patients was required. The assumptions we made for
calculation of the sample size were based on data from several
uncontrolled studies reporting significant improvement in liver
function tests following bone marrow cell therapy [20] [31], and
on the histological evidence of a sharp increase in hepatic
progenitors proliferative activity early after G-CSF administration
[15]. Patients who missed the 3-month follow-up visit, died or
were transplanted were considered as not having reached the
primary endpoint. Due to the non-parametric distribution of
variables, data were expressed as mean and its standard deviation
or median and its range. The Fisher’s exact test was used to
compare the proportion of patients in each group reaching the
primary endpoint. Binomial methods were used to construct the
confidence intervals around percentages. Quantitative variables
between groups were compared using the non-parametric Mann￾Whitney U-test. The ANOVA repeated measure test with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to assess
MELD changes in each treatment group for the effect of time.
Cytokines values and liver tissue parameters at baseline and at 3
months were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Correlations between MELD score changes and bone marrow cell
subpopulations were made using the Spearman rank test. All
analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principles. All tests
were two-sided, and the level of significance was set at a p,0.05.
The analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS 10.0 Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patients
The algorithm of patient selection complying with CONSORT
Guidelines is provided in figure 1. The median time between
admission and inclusion was similar between BMMCT and SMT
groups (6 days [3–6] versus 6 days [3–22], p = 0.21, respectively).
Table 1 provides the characteristics of the patients. At baseline
biopsy, all patients had cirrhosis and steatosis, with hepatocyte
ballooning present in all but 5 patients, and inflammatory changes
in all but 3 patients. The definite histological criteria for ASH were
reached in 47 (81%) of the patients, 22 in the BMMCT group
(60% with a Maddrey’s score $32), and 25 in the SMT group
(73% with a Maddrey’s score $32). In 11 patients, full criteria for
ASH were not met as neutrophilic infiltration could not be
evidenced on liver biopsy. Overall, all patients at baseline
presented severe histological findings typically reported in acute,
recent alcohol abuse [32]. The MELD score was similar between
groups, showing liver insufficiency, and all patients presented with
clinically significant portal hypertension. Due to severe ASH with
Maddrey’s score $32, 17 patients and 22 patients received a 4-
week course of prednisone in the BMMCT and SMT groups,
respectively. The mean duration of hospitalization was 27 days
[11–310] in the BMMCT group, and 27 days [8–212] in the SMT
group (p = NS). Durable alcohol abstinence was achieved in 39
patients. However, 7 and 11 patients in the BMMCT and SMT
groups, respectively, returned to moderate drinking (20–40 gr per
week) in spite of motivational and psychological support delivered
during the hospital stay. Except for one patient from the SMT
group who was lost to follow-up, the outcome of all patients could
be determined at 3 months.
Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation
Laboratory procedures were successful in all patients, and the
yield of mononuclear bone marrow cells was above 60% after
Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. The BMMCT procedure
could be fully administered in all but 2 patients (one patient
presented an acute variceal bleeding and another patient suffered
from an aspiration pneumonia during the mobilization period by
G-CSF). The mean number of MNC infused was
0.4760.156108
/kg, including 0.2460.116106 CD34+ cells/kg
and 3.3965.96105 MSC/kg. No blood products were adminis￾tered prior to arteriography. The infusion of MNC didn’t result in
any thrombosis during or after the procedure.
Liver Function Parameters
The evolution of the MELD score showed similar improvement
in both groups (figure 2). The percentage of patients who reached
the primary endpoint was 64% in the BMMCT group and 53% in
the SMT group (p value: 0.43 (OR 1.6, CI 0.49–5.4)(figure 3). In
the subgroup of patients who maintained complete alcohol

abstinence, the primary endpoint was reached in 81% and 74% in
BMMCT and SMT groups, respectively (p = 0.17).
At 4 weeks, a reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient
could be observed both in the BMMCT group (19.160.6 to
16.560.6 mmHg, p,0.01) and in the SMT group (19.960.4 to
18.260.6, p,0.03).
Adverse Events
Adverse events were equally distributed between groups
(Table 2). There were 17 serious adverse events including 2
deaths in the BMMCT group, and 24 serious adverse events in the
SMT group associated with the death of 4 patients. Causes of
death were related to acute variceal bleeding (day 35) and liver
failure (day 75) in the BMMCT group, and to intracranial
haemorrhage (day 15), sepsis (day 32, day 60), and multiple organ
failure (day 51) in the SMT group. In one patient, a transient
hematoma at the site of femoral artery puncture was considered a
serious adverse event attributable to BMMCT procedure. With
regard to the possible role of bone marrow cell in generating
hepatocellular carcinoma, no liver cancer was detected during this
short observation period.
Liver Tissue Studies
The evolution of steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and lobular
inflammation in paired liver biopsies from 26 patients in each
group is given in table 3. Steatosis decreased in both groups, but
changes in ballooning degeneration and inflammation were not
significant. As compared to baseline values, the number of
proliferating HPC tended to decrease at 4 weeks both in the
BMMCT (235%, p = 0.06) and in the SMT group (233%,
p = 0.11) (see table 4).
Cytokines and Blood Markers of Regeneration
Figure 4, 5, and 6, and table 5 provide data on markers of
regeneration and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Changes at
3 months in these biological parameters were similar in both
groups. Patients who reached the primary endpoint had higher
baseline HGF serum value as compared to those who didn’t (2870
[374–18318] versus 732 [248–12387] pg/ml, p,0.02).

Correlations
In the BMMCT group, the changes in the MELD score at 3
months correlated neither with the total number of infused MNC
(r = 0.2, p = 0.33), nor with the sub population of CD34+ cells
(r = 0.05, p = 0.7), nor with MSC (r = 0.2, p = 0.33).
Discussion
This trial was designed to test the potential of BMMCT to
stimulate regeneration in patients with clinically decompensated
ALD. In order to obtain mechanistic data on BMMCT on the
liver, we repeated a liver biopsy at 4 weeks. We demonstrate that
autologous BMMCT combined with SMT is not superior to SMT
alone using an improvement in the MELD score as an endpoint.
This study was designed in accordance with the recommended
approaches for trials of bone marrow stem cells in patients with
chronic liver diseases [33]. In order to gain maximal benefit of
BMMCT, we chose to combine G-CSF mobilization and direct
administration to the diseased liver. Mobilization by G-CSF
releases a moderate amount of CD34+ cells in blood [15], while an
apparent small proportion of these cells participate in liver
regeneration [11,33]. The delivery of a higher concentration of
bone marrow stem cells to the site of injury is thought to require
either direct administration into the hepatic artery or the portal
vein, or an ex vivo expansion of these cells prior to transplantation
[17]. There is some concerns of using the portal vein with regards
to the risk of infused cells bypassing the liver due to portal systemic
collaterals present in advanced cirrhosis. To better ensure cell
viability and feasibility in acutely ill patients, we excluded ex vivo
expansion of cellular subpopulations, and selected the hepatic
arterial route for stem cell reinfusion, as previously described in
several studies [34] [20] [35]. Determining the fate of infused bone
marrow cells is challenging. No clinical studies have explored their
level of engraftment into the diseased liver parenchyma, partly due
to the relative poor performance of cell tracing techniques
available [17]. In addition, immunohistochemical expression of
CD34, a marker of human hematopoietic stem cell, but also an
endothelial cell marker [36], may be gradually lost several weeks
following cell therapy.
We chose a 3-month follow-up with regards to the elevated
morbidity and mortality reported in this patient population with
decompensated ALD [2,3]. There was a parallel evolution of the
MELD score, biological values and liver tissue studies in both
groups, showing a reduction in the number of proliferating HPC
measured on the liver biopsy repeated at 4 weeks.
Following acute liver damage and liver cell loss, an increased

number of proliferating hepatocytes on liver biopsy is associated
with survival [37]. It is unknown whether bone marrow derived
cells or therapeutic stimulation of mature hepatocytes and their
progenitors may potentiate regeneration in ALD. We previously
showed that G-CSF alone safely elicited mobilization of circulating
CD34+ cells in patients with ASH, but without clinical improve￾ment on the short term [15]. Others used bone marrow cell
therapy in patients with liver failure related to hepatitis B without
G-CSF, with a transient improvement in liver function [38].
Similar to bone marrow donation where large numbers of cells are
needed, we chose to combine G-CSF-based mobilization with
bone marrow aspiration. We isolated well characterized popula￾tions of MNC and hypothesized that direct autologous transplan￾tation in the hepatic artery would constitute a sufficiently rich
cellular stimulus for liver regeneration as a result of the combined
proliferative effect of bone marrow cells and possible immune
modulatory properties of MSC [17]. As all our patients had
underlying cirrhosis, the reported risk of fibrosis promotion [39]
was not considered to be significant in this situation.
Two lines of reasoning may account for the absence of benefit in
our patients. Firstly, was the stimulus sufficient to induce
proliferation at the site of injury? Secondly, are there any target
organ specific features that would make it unresponsive to
BMMCT? Although we didn’t expand the bone marrow derived
cells in culture, the mean number of infused cells was in the range
of previous studies [33]. Nevertheless, both CD34+ and MSC
populations were lower than reported in healthy bone marrow
transplant donors [40] leading one to speculate that the number of
cells might have been insufficient to ensure adequate engraftment
and stimulation of regeneration. Accordingly, improvement in
liver function tests was observed following infusion of a greater
number of mononuclear bone marrow cells (86109 cells as
compared to 0.476108
/kg in our study) in patients abstinent from
alcohol with a moderately decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis [41].
In this study, increased activity in the liver area of 3 patients using
indium-111 scintigraphy suggested significant cell engraftment.
Thus, as the number of cells infused may be a critical parameter to
translate into a measurable biological benefit, it is generally
accepted that overall the proportion of bone marrow-derived
hepatocytes repopulating a diseased liver is small [11] [17]. Other
cellular subpopulations of the non haematopoietic bone marrow
compartment include MSC possessing immune modulatory
properties, endothelial progenitor cells [13] and macrophages.
Their potential benefits [42] and caveats [33] in modulating liver
repair mechanisms are still under investigation. In particular,
concerns have been raised regarding both the profibrogenic
potential of bone marrow cells and the risk of precipitating a
malignant transformation of liver cells [17]. Therefore, optimal
route of administration, fate, mechanisms of action and therapeu￾Table 4. Liver tissue studies on paired liver biopsies (n = 52).

tic potential of these bone marrow stem cells in regenerating a
chronically diseased liver remain at present ill defined.
Our BMMCT protocol included a 5-day G-CSF course to
mobilize bone marrow stem cell prior to bone marrow aspiration,
a procedure reported to increase circulating HGF [43] and
facilitate the homing of the cells in an animal model [44]. In
patients with decompensated ALD with ASH, increased levels of
circulating CD34+ cells were associated with proliferating HPC
within days of G-CSF [15], and survival at 2 months was
significantly improved in patients with acute-on-chronic liver
failure [16]. The present trial, which combined G-CSF, isolation
and concentration of bone marrow mononuclear cells, and direct
reinfusion at the site of injury, was not able to demonstrate any
effect on liver cell proliferation or improved liver function.
The second hypothesis relates to the target organ. Cirrhosis is a
state characterized by replicative senescence of hepatocytes [45]
that impairs liver cell. In alcoholic cirrhosis, acute and chronic
exposition to alcohol interferes with liver regeneration [19,46] and
may impair expansion of HPC in response to liver injury. The
florid alcoholic lesions present on early liver biopsy may create an
unfavourable microenvironment for cellular replication in acutely
decompensated ALD. In a randomized clinical trial on patients
with cirrhosis of mixed etiologies, Lyra et al. reported an
improvement in the Child-Pugh score but no significant changes
in MELD score during 90 days following cell therapy [34]. In
contrast, in patients hepatitis B, Peng et al. [38] reported a
significant improvement in liver function for several weeks
following autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation.
Thus, it may be hypothesized that the response to stem cell

therapy might be influenced by the aetiology of liver disease,
raising the possibility that the target organ might be unresponsive
to the proliferative stimulus.
A third hypothesis for a lack of beneficial effects of therapy on
liver function is alcohol relapse in 31% of our patients. Recurrence
of alcohol misuse in this population is not rare, reported in
approximately 40% of patients after a 3-month follow-up in a
recent review [47]. However, the quantity of alcohol our patients
declared during follow-up (20–40 gr/week) was clearly inferior as
compared to the initial heavy consumption (80–100 gr/day) at
time of hospital admission. Although a deleterious effect of this
moderate amount of alcohol in liver function cannot be ruled out,
MELD changes in the subgroups of abstainers and non abstainers
were similar.
Our study has several strengths including well characterized
study groups of acutely decompensated alcoholic cirrhotics with
similar characteristics at baseline, including a balanced number of
patients receiving steroids. However, we didn’t consider a
treatment group receiving only G-CSF mobilization therapy in
our study design. In fact, we chose to compare SMT alone to a
strategy that we believed could be most efficient to promote liver
repopulation and regeneration, that is G-CSF combined to
autologous BMMCT. In addition, we were not able to study the
fate nor the level of engraftment of the infused bone marrow cells
into the liver parenchyma. Thus, whether a larger number of
MNC are necessary to elicit a proliferative response in this clinical
situation remains speculative. Finally, the immunostaining results
obtained on the repeat liver biopsy provided only indirect
information regarding the effect of treatment.
This trial in non-abstinent patients admitted with decompen￾sated ALD is a truly negative study with comparable groups at
baseline, without any tendency toward improvement in BMMCT￾treated patients during follow-up. The parallel evolution of the
MELD score, biological and liver tissue parameters including
similar HPC profiles, suggest an apparent refractoriness to the
proliferative stimulus. BMMCT, which included G-CSF mobili￾zation therapy, failed to elicit HPC expansion and liver
regeneration. Autologous bone marrow derived cell transplanta￾tion in patients with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis is feasible
and well tolerated, but cannot be considered as a suitable
regenerative therapy. The mechanisms associated with this lack
of benefit warrants further studies.
