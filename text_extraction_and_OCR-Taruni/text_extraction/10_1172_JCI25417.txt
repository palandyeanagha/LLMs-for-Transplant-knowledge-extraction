Atrial natriuretic peptide: an essential 
physiological regulator of transvascular fluid, 
protein transport, and plasma volume
Fitz-Roy E. Curry
Department of Physiology and Membrane Biology, School of Medicine, University of California Davis, Davis, California, USA.
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) acts acutely to reduce plasma volume by at 
least 3 mechanisms: increased renal excretion of salt and water, vasodilation, 
and increased vascular permeability. Authors of a study in this issue of the 
JCI performed a knockout of the receptor for ANP in vascular endothelia 
in order to distinguish the effects of ANP-dependent increases in vascular 
permeability from those of other endocrine actions of ANP in the regula￾tion of plasma volume (see the related article beginning on page 1666). The 
knockout mice exhibited reduced vascular permeability to plasma protein, 
resulting in chronically increased plasma volume, arterial hypertension, and 
cardiac hypertrophy. Renal excretion and vasodilation did not account for 
these changes. Thus ANP-induced increases in endothelial permeability may 
be critical to the ability of ANP to lower arterial blood pressure.
Renal versus endothelial 
mechanisms in regulating 
plasma volume
Plasma volume is maintained by the interplay 
of mechanisms regulating total extracellular 
fluid volume and Starling forces, the lat￾ter of which govern the distribution of the 
extracellular fluid volume between the vas￾cular space and the interstitial space (1). For 
example, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is 
a small peptide secreted by the heart upon 
atrial stretch and high systemic blood pres￾sure. The acute effects of this potent, short￾lived peptide include increased glomerular 
filtration and increased renal excretion of 
sodium and water. These changes may serve 
to decrease blood volume and subsequently 
lower blood pressure (2, 3). However, if these 
renal responses were the primary effects of 
ANP action, the loss of tubular fluid derived 
from glomerular filtration of plasma would 
concentrate the plasma proteins in the vas￾cular space. The resultant increase in the 
osmotic pressure of the plasma protein con￾centration would favor reabsorption of fluid 
across the endothelial barrier from the inter￾stitial space. Thus, the tendency of ANP￾dependent renal mechanisms to decrease 
plasma volume would be opposed by the 
change in Starling forces, which would tend 
to increase plasma volume.
In addition to these renal effects, ANP 
causes both vasodilation, by relaxing vascu￾lar smooth muscle, and an acute increase in 
vascular permeability via receptors on the 
microvascular endothelium (4, 5). These 
mechanisms also decrease blood volume by 
favoring redistribution of plasma protein 
and fluid from the vascular space to the 
interstitial space. Thus, a key question con￾cerning the role of ANP in the regulation of 
plasma volume is the relative importance 
of the renal versus the nonrenal actions of 
ANP. Renkin and Tucker (5) argued that 
the extrarenal actions of ANP enable it to 
preferentially regulate plasma volume. The 
study reported by Sabrane, Kuhn, and col￾leagues in this issue of the JCI (6) provides 
new data to support this hypothesis by 
investigating the regulation of plasma vol￾ume in transgenic mice in which one of the 
common receptors for ANP has been selec￾tively deleted in vascular endothelium.
Selective deletion of the endothelial 
receptor for ANP
Over the past decade, investigators have 
examined a number of mouse models in 
which global deletion of the genes for 
ANP, the closely related B-type natriuretic 
peptide (BNP), or the ANP/BNP receptor, 
guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A; also known as 
natriuretic peptide receptor 1), resulted in 
varying degrees of hypertension, expanded 
plasma volumes, and cardiac hypertrophy. 
These results support the hypothesis that 
the common ANP/BNP receptor, GC-A, 
signaling via a guanylyl cyclase pathway, is 
essential for plasma volume regulation but 
do not enable evaluation of the relative con￾tributions of renal, vascular smooth mus￾cle, and endothelial cell–mediated mecha￾nisms to this regulation. An important 
step toward the goal to evaluate the contri￾bution of each mechanism was made when 
Holtwick, Kuhn, and colleagues used Cre￾lox technology to selectively delete GC-A 
in the vascular smooth muscle cells of mice 
(7). The mutant mice were not hyperten￾sive, suggesting that the direct vasodilating 
actions of ANP on vascular smooth muscle 
cells do not contribute significantly to the 
hypertensive phenotype.0
Utilizing a similar strategy, Sabrane, 
Kuhn, and coworkers have now used a 
loxP/Tie2-Cre recombination system to 
selectively delete the gene for GC-A in 
mouse vascular endothelium (6). The 
authors show that the direct vasodilating 
effects of ANP on isolated arteries and 
apparently normal renal function were 
preserved in endothelial cell–specific GC-A 
knockout mice; however, the animals still 
exhibited a hypertensive phenotype with 
expanded vascular volume and cardiac 
hypertrophy. Importantly, ANP infusion 
did not cause an acute reduction in plasma 
volume or an increase in albumin loss from 
the plasma volume even though it exerted 
these expected effects on control mice. The 
simplest interpretation of these results 
is that deletion of the GC-A receptor in 
endothelial cells attenuates the action of 
ANP to increase the permeability of the 
endothelial barrier to plasma proteins. The 
result is sustained reduction of permeabil￾ity of the microvessels to plasma proteins 
(mainly albumin), which are redistributed 
from the interstitial space to the vascular 
space. This leads to a change in plasma 
protein osmotic pressure, which causes an

expanded plasma volume. A chronically 
increased vascular volume and increased 
ventricular filling could account for 
increased cardiac output, the development 
of hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy 
as has been observed.
Vascular permeability and modified 
plasma protein osmotic forces
If this interpretation is correct, this study 
provides the most reliable data to date 
demonstrating that changes in the distri￾bution of plasma proteins due to physio￾logical regulation of vascular permeability 
are essential not only in acute but also in 
chronic regulation of plasma volume (6). 
Figure 1A illustrates some of the known 
endothelial cell pathways by which plasma 
protein transport from blood to tissue may 
be reduced in mice lacking ANP-dependent 
signaling pathways; they include diffusion 
and convective transport through intercel￾lular junctions (i.e., highly selective path￾ways with the ultrafiltrate of plasma hav￾ing a low protein concentration) as well as 
through vesicular pathways and rare gaps 
and large pores (less selective pathways) 
(reviewed in ref. 1). The concentration of 
plasma proteins entering the interstitial 
space from each pathway differs, and the 
concentration of plasma proteins in the 
interstitial space is determined by the mix￾ing of protein fluxes and water flows. These 
differences in flux of water and solute are 
often ignored, and only an average concen￾tration in the interstitial space considered. 
Taking this approach as a first approxi￾mation, the mechanisms regulating fluid 
balance in endothelial cell–specific GC-A 
knockout mice described by Sabrane, Kuhn 
et al. (6) can be understood if either a reduc￾tion in the number of pathways for protein 
transport or an increase in the selectivity to 
plasma protein within individual pathways 
reduces the average plasma protein concen￾tration in the interstitial space.
It is usually assumed that the osmotic 
pressure due to the average interstitial 
protein concentration (πt) can be used in 
the Starling principle to describe net water 
flow (Jv).

Pathways for water and plasma proteins across 
the endothelial barrier that may be regulated by 
ANP. (A) Pathways for plasma protein transport 
across the endothelial permeability barrier that 
ANP may modulate, including water and plas￾ma transport through the interendothelial cleft 
at sites where there are infrequent breaks in the 
junctional strand (see refs. 1, 8) and specialized 
vesicular pathways and large pore pathways (1). 
The plasma protein concentration in the intersti￾tial space is normally about 40% of that in the 
plasma. An ANP-induced increase in vascular 
permeability decreases the difference in plasma 
protein osmotic pressure between blood and the 
interstitial space and favors a reduced plasma 
volume. Conversely, decreased vascular perme￾ability favors increased plasma volume. The lat￾ter mechanism would describe results of experi￾ments where the ANP/BNP receptor, GC-A, on 
vascular endothelial cells is selectively deleted 
(6). Similar mechanisms are likely to act even 
more effectively when the endothelial glycocalyx 
has a low permeability to plasma proteins and 
contributes to the formation of a plasma ultra￾filtrate with low–plasma protein concentration 
(and low-protein osmotic pressure). (B) Magni￾fied view of the cleft pathway where the plasma 
protein concentration in the narrow space is 
lower than the mixed–plasma protein concen￾tration in the interstitial space. Thus, as shown 
in C, the difference in plasma protein osmotic 
pressure across the glycocalyx (πc – πg) may 
be significantly larger than the plasma-to-tis￾sue colloid osmotic pressure (πc – πt), and an 
ANP-induced increase in the permeability of

tion coefficient of the microvascular walls 
to plasma protein, so that σ(πc – πt) mea￾sures the effective osmotic pressure differ￾ence of the plasma proteins between the 
plasma and the interstitial space. However, 
it is now understood that the balance of 
Starling forces involved in the regulation 
of transvascular fluid balance is far more 
subtle than previously recognized (1, 8). 
This insight suggests additional ways 
to interpret the results described in the 
Sabrane et al. (6) study.
Figure 1B illustrates the idea that the 
difference in plasma osmotic pressure of 
the plasma proteins involved in transvas￾cular fluid transport is exerted across the 
endothelial surface glycocalyx, not the 
whole endothelial barrier as suggested 
above (see ref. 8 for details). The main path￾way for water exchange between the plasma 
and interstitial space is through the inter￾cellular cleft between adjacent endothelial 
cells, at sites where there are infrequent 
narrow breaks in the junctional strands. 
The glycocalyx on the endothelial cell sur￾face forms an additional series resistance 
at the entrance to the intercellular cleft 
on the vascular side. Figure 1B illustrates 
details of the flow of the plasma ultrafil￾trate (low-protein concentration) through 
the interendothelial cleft in Figure1A at the 
site of a break in the junctional strand. The 
glycocalyx has a low but finite permeability 
to the plasma proteins and is the main per￾meability barrier to plasma proteins that 
cross via the endothelial cleft. With this 
arrangement, the plasma protein concen￾tration, with osmotic pressure πg in the very 
narrow space beneath the glycocalyx can be 
maintained at a lower level than the protein 
concentration in the interstitial space (with 
osmotic pressure πt). Relevant to the results 
reported by Sabrane et al. (6), the magni￾tude of πg can be modified by increases or 
decreases in the permeability of the gly￾cocalyx to plasma proteins. It can also be 
modified by changes in the tissue plasma 
protein concentration far away from the 
cleft (because of the back diffusion of the 
proteins from the interstitial space; see ref. 
8 for more details). Thus, as illustrated in 
Figure 1C, the plasma protein osmotic pres￾sure opposing fluid filtration (πc – πg) may 
be significantly greater than the plasma￾to-tissue colloid osmotic pressure (πc – πt), 
and it is the magnitude of (πc – πg) rather 
than (πc – πt) that should be considered as 
the principal osmotic pressure determinant 
of transvascular water flow in the Starling 
principle. Thus, regulation of the plasma 
protein permeability of the glycocalyx by 
ANP-dependent mechanisms may be just 
as important as other ANP-dependent 
mechanisms, such as changes in the perme￾ability of vesicular and large-pore pathways 
illustrated in Figure 1A. This is an area for 
further investigation.
Future investigations
The idea that a reduction in vascular per￾meability to plasma proteins is the pri￾mary mechanism explaining the results of 
Sabrane, Kuhn, and colleagues (6) assumes 
that there are no significant changes in 
other variables that might be linked to 
endothelial functions, including albumin 
uptake into the endothelial cells controlled 
by scavenger receptors and microvascular 
function in the kidney affecting the glo￾merular filtration of plasma proteins as 
well as water reabsorption in the vasa recta 
and peritubular capillaries. As described by 
Sabrane, Kuhn, and colleagues (6), the loxP/
Tie2-Cre recombination system has been 
used previously to delete specific genes in 
endothelium, with this deletion resulting 
in the loss of such endothelial cell–specific 
functions as angiogenesis and endothelial 
cell nitric oxide production. However, the 
use of this approach to specifically modify 
vascular permeability is novel and assumes 
effective deletion of the common ANP/
BNP receptor in endothelial cells in the 
microvessels where most water and plasma 
protein transport occurs (mainly true cap￾illaries and venular capillaries). Although 
the authors present evidence for deletion 
of the gene encoding GC-A from vascular 
endothelium in tissue samples from mouse 
tail, heart, lung, and aortas and show sig￾nificantly reduced expression of this recep￾tor in heart and kidney, further studies 
are needed to measure the effectiveness 
of the Tie2 promoter in reducing GC-A 
expression in microvascular and venular 
endothelium and in specific fenestrated 
endothelium such as that associated with 
the glomerulus and vasa recta.
It is also important to point out that 
direct measurements of vascular perme￾ability were not made in the experiments 
described in the present study (6). Changes 
in accumulation of radiolabeled albumin 
after 30 minutes of ANP infusion were 
measured in 9 different tissue types in 
receptor knockout mice and compared 
with those in floxed controls. The mea￾sured accumulation included albumin in 
the vascular space, so it is possible that 
the real levels of interstitial space albumin 
accumulation were smaller than the total 
accumulations reported, especially if there 
was an expanded vascular volume in the 
microvascular beds of the tissues investi￾gated. Further investigations of real change 
in permeability and the mechanisms regu￾lating the blood-to-tissue transport of the 
plasma proteins by ANP in these knockout 
models will require the use of more refined 
methods that use 2 tracers for albumin: 
the first for total accumulation and the 
second to directly measure the amount of 
albumin in the vascular spaces in each tis￾sue (see refs. 4, 5).
Further investigators would do well to 
be guided by the careful evaluations by 
Sabrane, Kuhn et al. (6) of the renal and 
cardiac functions in these animals. No 
significant changes in food, water, and 
sodium intake or urine, water, or sodium 
excretion was found in the endothelial cell–
specific GC-A knockout animals. If renal 
mechanisms of salt and water excretion 
contributed to the observed hypervolumia, 
then a reduced-salt diet would be expected 
to attenuate the response. Yet dietary salt 
restriction had no effect on the hyperten￾sive state. Nevertheless, the study would 
be strengthened by further investigations 
of the way in which ANP-independent 
homeostatic mechanisms (such as renal 
responses to hypertension and volume 
expansion) chronically adapt to sustained 
volume expansion. In addition, reliable 
measurements of circulating ANP, renin, 
and aldosterone levels are needed.
In summary, although ANP-dependent 
modulation of vascular permeability was 
recognized soon after the discovery of ANP, 
the importance of changes in vascular per￾meability in regulating the distribution of 
water between the plasma space and the 
interstitial space has not been widely recog￾nized. The elegant study by Sabrane, Kuhn, 
and colleagues (6) establishes the primary 
role of ANP-dependent increases in the per￾meability of the vascular endothelial barrier 
to plasma proteins in the chronic control 
of plasma volume. The study also points 
the way to important new experiments and 
approaches for investigating in what way 
defects in ANP-dependent mechanisms 
regulating endothelial permeability may 
contribute to the development of cardio￾vascular disease, including hypertension.

Hyperplasia of pulmonary artery SMCs (PASMCs) is a pathological hallmark 
of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In this issue of the JCI, McMurtry 
et al. report that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of survivin — a mul￾tipotent inhibitor of apoptosis — induces PAH in rats, whereas inhalation 
of an adenovirus vector encoding a mutant survivin gene with dominant￾negative properties reverses established monocrotaline-induced PAH (see 
the related article beginning on page 1479). These findings raise important 
issues regarding the role of survivin in the pathogenesis of PAH, its value as a 
prognostic indicator, and its use as a target for new therapeutic strategies.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
and smooth muscle hyperplasia: 
unresolved questions
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), 
whether idiopathic (iPAH) or associated 
with underlying diseases (aPAH), is an 
unexplained condition for which severe 
forms in adults or neonates are fatal and 
no satisfactory treatment is available. 
Valuable new insights into the disease 
have stemmed in recent years from genetic 
studies identifying mutations in the gene 
encoding bone morphogenic protein recep￾tor type 2 (BMPRII) in patients with famil￾ial iPAH (1, 2) and from functional stud￾ies showing dysregulation of molecular 
events governing pulmonary artery SMC 
(PASMC) proliferation (3). The nature of 
the primary defect responsible for trigger￾ing, maintaining, and arresting PASMC 
proliferation in PAH is poorly understood 
but may be either an inherent characteris￾tic of PASMCs (as seen with cancer cells) or 
a secondary response to an external abnor￾mality, such as upregulation of a growth 
factor. Under the first hypothesis, cells 
removed from their in vivo environment 
would continue to proliferate excessively, 
whereas under the second hypothesis, 
their proliferation rate would be normal. 
An intermediate situation has been found: 
when removed from their in vivo envi￾ronment, PASMCs from PAH patients 
demonstrate excessive proliferation when 
stimulated by serotonin (5-hydroxytryp￾tamine [5-HT]) or endothelin-1 (ET-1) 
but not when stimulated by PDGF, EGF, 
FGF, IGF, or TGF-β (4, 5). Moreover, they 
are far less sensitive to growth inhibition 
by bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) 
than are normal cells (6). Therefore, the 
intrinsic abnormalities of these PASMCs 
involve not intracellular mitogenic signals 
but rather signal transmission from spe￾cific autocrine or paracrine factors such 
as BMPs, 5-HT, or ET-1. Increased expres￾sion of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), 
which mediates the proliferative effect of 
5-HT, and marked reduction of BMPRII 
expression appear specific to iPAH and 
aPAH (4, 7). These molecular alterations 
occur without apparent genetic abnor￾malities: in cells without the mutation in 
BMPRII, the extent of BMPRII underex￾pression is similar to that in mutated cells 
(6), and the 5-HTT overexpression can be 
explained only partly by the polymorphism 
of its gene promoter (5). Why PASMCs 
from PAH patients maintain an abnormal 
phenotype in vitro and how environmental 
and genetic factors regulate the expression 
of these key molecular transmitters remain 
open questions.
Until now, alterations in apoptotic pro￾cesses have not been considered to play a 
role in PASMC proliferation, in contrast 
to mechanisms of disorganized EC prolif￾eration contributing to plexiform lesions 
at branch points of pulmonary arteries in 
iPAH (8). In this issue of the JCI, McMur￾try et al. open up the intriguing possibility 
that increased survivin expression may con￾tribute to the abnormal PASMC phenotype 
observed in PAH (9).
Is there a role for survivin 
in the pathogenesis of PAH?
Survivin belongs to the inhibitor of 
apoptosis protein (IAP) family, members 
of which confer protection from death￾inducing stimuli (10). One of the most 
striking features of survivin is its differen￾tial expression in cancerous versus normal 
tissues. Survivin is virtually undetectable 
in normal adult differentiated tissues but 
is expressed in most human cancers (11). 
Thus, dysregulated survivin expression is 
considered to be a major pathologic mech￾anism of apoptosis inhibition. However, 
survivin pathway reactivation may occur
