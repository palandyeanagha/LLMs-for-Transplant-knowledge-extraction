Abstract
Fibroblast growth factor 21 is a novel hormonal regulator with the potential to treat a broad variety of metabolic
abnormalities, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and cardiovascular disease. Human recombinant wild type
FGF21 (FGF21) has been shown to ameliorate metabolic disorders in rodents and non-human primates. However,
development of FGF21 as a drug is challenging and requires re-engineering of its amino acid sequence to improve protein
expression and formulation stability. Here we report the design and characterization of a novel FGF21 variant, LY2405319.
To enable the development of a potential drug product with a once-daily dosing profile, in a preserved, multi-use
formulation, an additional disulfide bond was introduced in FGF21 through Leu118Cys and Ala134Cys mutations. FGF21
was further optimized by deleting the four N-terminal amino acids, His-Pro-Ile-Pro (HPIP), which was subject to proteolytic
cleavage. In addition, to eliminate an O-linked glycosylation site in yeast a Ser167Ala mutation was introduced, thus
allowing large-scale, homogenous protein production in Pichia pastoris. Altogether re-engineering of FGF21 led to
significant improvements in its biopharmaceutical properties. The impact of these changes was assessed in a panel of
in vitro and in vivo assays, which confirmed that biological properties of LY2405319 were essentially identical to FGF21.
Specifically, subcutaneous administration of LY2405319 in ob/ob and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice over 7–14 days resulted
in a 25–50% lowering of plasma glucose coupled with a 10–30% reduction in body weight. Thus, LY2405319 exhibited all
the biopharmaceutical and biological properties required for initiation of a clinical program designed to test the hypothesis
that administration of exogenous FGF21 would result in effects on disease-related metabolic parameters in humans.

Introduction
Since the initial identification of FGF21 as a novel metabolic
regulator [1], this protein has become the focus of intense research
in the area of glucose and lipid homeostasis and an important
target for drug discovery initiatives [2]. Indeed, the potential
metabolic benefits of FGF21 pharmacology in preclinical models
are striking and provide a compelling rationale for ongoing life
sciences research. When administered to rodents and non-human
primates, exogenous FGF21 induces potent lowering of blood
glucose, triggers improvements in insulin sensitivity, and enhances
pancreatic b-cell function and mass. Additional pharmacologic
effects of FGF21 include a reversal of hepatosteatosis and
a reduction in adipose tissue mass. Importantly, triglyceride
lowering and a beneficial shift in plasma lipoprotein profiles
suggest the potential of an FGF21-based therapy for amelioration
of cardiovascular disease risk [2].
The initial evaluation of formulation properties indicated a low
probability for development of an FGF21 molecule suitable for
clinical use. Furthermore, as the Type 2 diabetic patient
population is exponentially growing [3], there was a need to
select a cost-effective scalable expression platform and purification
manufacturing process for an FGF21-based protein. Thus, the
strategic intent of our FGF21 biopharmaceutical re-engineering
efforts were driven by the desire to create a stable, concentrated,
and preserved solution preparation, while maintaining a favorable
bioactivity profile that was amenable to a wide range of dosing
demands in future clinical trials and potentially broader popula￾tions of patients.
Here we describe the design, structural characteristics, bio￾pharmaceutical and pharmacologic properties of a novel FGF21
variant, LY2405319. The biopharmaceutical optimization of
FGF21 was aimed at enhancing physical stability of the protein,
enabling its expression in yeast (Pichia pastoris) all while maintaining
its in vivo biological potency relative to the native molecule yielding
our engineered FGF21 analog, LY2405319. LY2405319 was
selected for further testing in early stage clinical trials. The results
of these clinical development efforts will be reported in future
publications with the intent of shedding light on the therapeutic
utility of FGF21-based therapies.

Materials and Methods
Homology Modeling
LY2405319 structure was generated from a homology model
(residues 18–140) based on known FGF structures using a pro￾prietary algorithm.
Biophysical Screen
Biophysical screening focused on evaluation of physical stability
in the presence of preservative (m-cresol) under physiological
subcutaneous conditions (37uC; 150 mM NaCl). Dynamic light
scattering, at 90uC, was used to monitor aggregation at 10 mg/ml
for up to 24 hours at 37uC in PBS with m-cresol.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
The DSC thermograms of FGF21 and LY2405319 were
collected on a VP-DSC Instrument (Microcal, Piscataway, NJ).
The concentration of protein was between 1–2 mg/mL in PBS
buffer. Both PBS and sample solutions were degassed before
loading in the cells. The scanning parameters for the DSC
experiment were as follows: the temperature scan range was 10–
95uC, scan rate was 60uC/hr, pre-scan thermostat was 15 minutes,
post-scan thermostat was 10 minutes, and the filtering period was
set at 16 sec. The experimental parameter included number scan
of 12–20 and a post-cycle thermostat of 10uC. The cells were filled
with temperatures between 10–20uC.
Protein Expression in E. coli & Purification
FGF21 was purified from a BL21 E. coli expression system from
granules isolated from cells, which were collected by centrifuga￾tion. Granules were solubilized and sulfitolyzed in TRIS/7 M
Urea at pH 9. All chromatography steps were done at room
temperature. The solubilized protein was initially purified by Fast
Flow Q Sepharose prior to refolding. FGF21 was diluted to
approximately 0.5 mg/mL with 20 mM glycine at pH 9 and then
folded by addition of cysteine to a final concentration of 2 mM.
The refolding solution was incubated at 4uC for 48 hours with 1
buffer exchange. The folded protein was purified using preparative
reversed-phase chromatography on a Vydac C18 column. pH of
the reversed-phase pool was adjusted to greater than pH 7. The
pooled FGF21 fraction was subsequently purified using Superdex
75 size exclusion chromatography. Mono Q anion exchange
chromatography was used for the final polishing step. The final
pool was dialyzed overnight at 4uC into PBS, pH 7.4. For FGF21
variants expressed in the HEK293/EBNA expression system, the
same chromatography steps were followed as described above
excluding the protein fold. The average purity (by HPLC) of
FGF21 proteins was .95%.
Engineering for Expression in Pichia Pastoris
All molecular biology work was carried out utilizing standard
methods, including DNA cloning, PCR, protein expression
evaluations, and analyses. Modifications to the native FGF21
gene (i.e., construction of variants) were made using standard
PCR-based methodologies (overlap extension mutagenesis) and
genes were designed to be cloned directly into Pichia expression
plasmid backbones. Alternatively genes were constructed synthet￾ically (GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany).
Recombinant strains were screened for FGF21 variant expres￾sion utilizing a variety of methods that included silver and
Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels, Western blot analyses,
and ELISA [4], or HPLC analyses. A glucose uptake assay was
used to determine the activity of native FGF21 and all variants
produced.
A Pichia expression system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used
for protein production. The parental expression plasmids utilized
the a-mating factor prepro-peptide as the secretion signal and
utilized the GAPDH promoter for the constitutive expression of
the gene of interest [5]. In addition, these expression plasmids
contained a second expression cassette for the production of green
fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the AOX1
promoter. GFP co-expression was used as a screening tool in
identifying high-producing recombinant strains. Regulation of the
AOX1 promoter by methanol addition allows GFP to be
expressed during the strain screening process, but not expressed
during the manufacturing process. The expression host utilized
was SMD1163, a derivative of the GS115 strain containing
additional mutations that inactivate the Pep4 and Prb1 vacuolar
proteases, which literature have suggested can impact protein
quality [6].
Fermentations were inoculated from shake-flasks, following
a two-stage vegetative culture growth. After inoculation, the cells
go through an exponential growth consuming a pre-defined feed
of glucose. When the glucose was consumed, a dissolved oxygen
(DO) spike was observed followed by a pH spike, indicating the
consumption of organic acids produced during growth on glucose.
The pH spike signals the controller to decrease the temperature
from 30uC to 22uC, to ramp up airflow and agitation and to
supply a limiting glucose feed. The pH was maintained at 7.0
during most of the process using ammonium hydroxide addition.
Cell mass and FGF21 variant titers increased throughout the
fermentation. In general, the run proceeds for 48 hours after the
pH spike (approximately, 75 hours in total). .
In vitro Biology
Cell lines and proteins. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and HepG2
hepatoma cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). 3T3-L1

manufacturer’s instructions and an EnVision Multilabel Micro￾plate Reader Model 2103 (Perkin Elmer) with the AlphaScreen
HTS Turbo option was used for signal detection.
RNA isolation, RT and real-time quantitative PCR. RNA
was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a High￾Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (PE Applied Biosys￾tems, Foster City, CA). Reactions were performed in triplicate on
an ABI Prism 7900HT (PE Applied Biosystems) and were
normalized to either 36B4 mRNA or 18S rRNA. Assays-on￾Demand Gene Expression Products (PE Applied Biosystems) were

old diet-induced obese (DIO) male C57/BL6 mice (Taconic, NY)
were maintained on a high fat diet (TD95217; Harlan Teklad,
Madison, WI) from weaning and had free access to food and water
for at least 12 weeks before randomization by weight. Male ob/ob
mice (Harlan) were maintained on Teklad 2014 chow with free
access to food and water for a minimum of 5 weeks before
randomization by blood glucose. Animals were individually
housed in a temperature-controlled (24uC) facility with a 12:12
light:dark cycle. DIO and ob/ob mice were treated, for 14 or 7
days, respectively, with vehicle or various doses of FGF21 and
FGF21 variants, as indicated, via continuous subcutaneous
infusion with mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet, Cupertino, CA). Food
intake and body weight were recorded daily. Body composition of
DIO mice was determined using Quantitative Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance analysis (ECHO MRI, 3-1 Composition Analyzer;
Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX) on the initiation of
treatment (Day 1) and on the last day of treatment (Day 14).

Results
Biophysical Stability of FGF21 Under Physiological
Conditions
Adequate and effective treatment of the Type 2 diabetes (T2D)
patient population with a protein therapy amenable to once-daily
(QD) administration requires the development of a multi-use
preserved formulation. However, it is well established that
phenolic preservatives in pharmaceutical preparations can induce
the formation of protein-based insoluble aggregates [9–13] that
can lead to undesired immunological reactions [14]; consequently,
a successful recombinant protein engineered for broader clinical
use should exhibit a robust stability in the formulation and under
subcutaneous conditions.
To assess the physical stability characteristics of FGF21 in
a solution containing preservative, the protein was formulated at
10 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 30 mM
m-cresol at pH 7.4. Physical stability was assessed by dynamic
light-scattering at 37uC. Our data suggest that FGF21 rapidly
aggregates under these conditions (Figure 1). These results suggest
that the preservative may be unfavorably altering the conforma￾tional state of FGF21 under conditions analogous to exogenous
administration thus promoting undesired protein-protein interac￾tions.
Thermal Stability of FGF21
To assess the conformational stability of FGF21, the protein was
subjected to differential scanning calorimetry (Figure 2A). The
results show that the protein undergoes at least three thermal￾unfolding states suggesting a conformationally dynamic protein.
More notably, FGF21 unfolding is apparent at 37uC, potentially
due to access of the hydrophobic phenolic preservative to the
hydrophobic core of the protein and, subsequently, destabilization
of its native structure leading to aggregation [12]. The access of
a small phenolic molecule to the hydrophobic core of proteins has
been well documented with T4 lysozyme [15].
Engineering Conformational Stability
The initial evaluation of FGF21 established that the successful
generation of its preserved commercial formulation would be
unlikely due to protein aggregation in the presence of preservative
under physiological conditions (Figure 1). This was further
exacerbated by the poor conformational/thermal stability of
FGF21 (Figure 2A). To improve the probability of technical
success of creating a preserved formulation of an FGF21 variant,
we optimized FGF21 aiming to increase its conformational
stability in the presence of preservatives and under concentrated,
physiologic conditions, while maintaining a favorable bioactivity
profile.
To improve conformational stability, and subsequent biophar￾maceutical properties, a disulfide stabilization engineering strategy
was used. This approach utilized the FGF21 homology model
(Figure 3) derived from existing X-ray structures of various FGF
molecules and sequence alignments between human, mouse and
rat FGF21 orthologs [16]. Based on distance and orientation
constraints assessed via the structure modeling, we modified the
FGF21 sequence via point-specific mutagenesis to introduce an
additional disulfide bond. This yielded a variant where the
engineered disulfide bond at Leu118Cys-Ala134Cys stabilized
a loop at the C-terminal domain of FGF21.
Engineering for Expression in Pichia Pastoris
Initial attempts to express FGF21 in Pichia pastoris resulted in low
productivity (,1 mg/L at shake-flask scale) in addition to
numerous issues related to the integrity/heterogeneity of the
secreted product. Specifically, in yeast, FGF21 underwent
significant proteolysis, with the major clipping observed at the
N-terminus of the protein resulting in almost complete removal of
the first four amino acids, HPIP. A second major quality issue was
the high level of O-linked glycosylation observed (.70%).
The introduction of a second disulfide bond in FGF21 resulted
in major improvements in productivity and protein quality in
Pichia pastoris. Productivity was increased by more than three
orders of magnitude (.100 mg/L at shake-flask scale; Figure 4).

This rise correlated with improved thermal stability of the protein
[17]. However, despite higher yields compared to native FGF21,
the quality of the FGF21 variant produced in Pichia pastoris
remained inadequate due to high levels of N-terminal proteolysis
and O-linked glycosylation.
To address protein quality challenges, the FGF21 variant was
further re-engineered to decrease the level of O-linked glycosyl￾ation through specific amino acid substitutions at key positions.
Serine at position 167 (Ser167) was identified via peptide mapping
as the major O-linked glycosylation site and was subjected to site￾specific mutagenesis. Out of 11 constructs with single amino acid
substitution that were designed and screened, the preferred
variant, Ser167Ala, was chosen based on neutrality of amino
change and impact on protein activity. Protein characterization of
the FGF21 variant produced in Pichia pastoris displayed low levels

of O-linked glycosylation (,3%), confirming Ser167 as the
primary glycosylation site in yeast.
To address the heterogeneity of secreted product associated
with N-terminal proteolysis due to aminopeptidase activity,
FGF21 was further modified to remove the first four N-terminal
amino acids, DHPIP. The decision to include this truncation was
based on the knowledge that DHPIP FGF21 is fully biologically
active [18,19].
Subsequently, the optimized FGF21 variant for Pichia pastoris
expression, FGF21 Leu118Cys-Ala134Cys, Ser167Ala, DHPIP, or
LY2405319, was produced at manufacturing-scale in fermentation
tanks (at greater than 1 g/L) and was essentially devoid of the O￾glycosylation/N-terminal processing heterogeneity issues associat￾ed with native FGF21.
Biophysical Characteristics of LY2405319
To assess the impact of the modifications on biophysical
properties, yeast-produced LY2405319 was evaluated by dynamic
light-scattering at 37uC (Figure 1). The results demonstrate
enhanced physical stability of LY2405319 compared to FGF21,
which rapidly aggregated under these conditions. Our data also
suggest that the engineered disulfide bond in the C-terminal
domain of FGF21 stabilizes the protein from aggregation induced
by phenolic preservative. Moreover, the engineered disulfide bond
clearly improves the conformational instability of FGF21 as
exemplified by the collapse of the thermal unfolding from a three￾state, conformationally dynamic profile into a single conformation
state for LY2405319 with a Tm of 68.5uC, and little to no thermal
unfolding at 37uC (Figure 2B). These results suggest that the
engineered disulfide significantly improves the conformational
stability of LY2405319 and likely minimizes phenolic preservative￾induced aggregation by limiting its access to the hydrophobic core
of the FGF21 variant. Thus, intelligently re-engineering FGF21 to
LY2405319 yields a homogenous protein product that is amenable
to yeast production and possesses the necessary stability required
for the multi-use formulation of a therapeutic protein.
Comparing Bioactivities of FGF21 and LY2405319
As the goal of FGF21 engineering was to improve biopharma￾ceutical properties of the protein while maintaining its in vivo
potency, LY2405319 was profiled for bioactivity in cell culture
studies and in mouse models of diabetes in a panel of in vitro and
in vivo assays that have been previously established to characterize
the effects of FGF21 [1,18–21].
In vitro
LY2405319 was evaluated head-to-head with FGF21 in an
ERK1/2 phosphorylation assay in 3T3-L1 cells with stable over￾expression of bKlotho (Klb), a critical co-factor for FGF21 action
[8,22–24]. Both, LY2405319 and FGF21 stimulated ERK1/2
phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 cells expressing Klb (Figure 5A). In
this assay, LY2405319 and FGF21 demonstrated equivalent
potency (Table 1).
LY2405319 and FGF21 were both inactive on either cells
expressing aKlotho (Kl), a related family member necessary for
FGF23 but not FGF21 action (Figure 5B) [25], or on parental L1
fibroblasts that are devoid of Klb expression (Figure 5C) [8].
Importantly, these cells responded to stimulation with FGF1 by
ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 5A–C), a canonical non-Kl/
Klb-dependent member of the FGF superfamily [26], confirming
the presence of functional FGFRs in all three cell lines utilized in
these experiments. Finally, only 3T3-L1/Kl (Figure 5B) but not
parental 3T3-L1 or 3T3-L1/Klb fibroblasts (Figure 5A & C) were
activated by FGF23 corroborating the presence of a functional and
FGF23-specific Klotho co-factor in 3T3-L1/Kl cells. Taken
together, these observations are consistent with the specific
requirement of Klb, and not of Kl, for both FGF21 and
LY2405319 activity.
Next, LY2405319 was evaluated for its ability to stimulate
glucose uptake in cells expressing Klb, as has been previously
demonstrated with FGF21 [18]. LY2405319 stimulated glucose
uptake in 3T3-L1/Klb fibroblasts with equivalent potency to
FGF21 (Figure 6A; Table 1). The differentiation of 3T3-L1
fibroblasts to adipocytes results in increased expression of
endogenous Klb thus conferring FGF21 responsiveness [8].
Therefore, LY2405319-induced glucose uptake was next exam￾ined in differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a cell line in
which the bioactivity of FGF21 was initially found via a potency
screen [1]. LY2405319 in this system also demonstrated a compa￾rable potency to FGF21 (Figure 6B; Table 1).
Having shown bioactivity equivalent to native FGF21 in mouse
3T3-L1 cells, LY2405319 action was next evaluated in HepG2
hepatoma cells that are of human origin and endogenously express
Klb and FGFRs [27,28]. Again, LY2405319 demonstrated
equivalent potency to FGF21 as measured in a GLUT1
transcription assay, a known readout of FGF21 activity [1]
(Figure 6C; Table 1).
Finally, LY2405319 was examined for possible mitogenic
activity in HepG2 cells. Under conditions where 0.4 nM FGF2
and 50 nM insulin induced a rise in [methyl-3
H] thymidine
incorporation (2.4 and 3 fold, respectively), no significant increase
was observed when HepG2 cells were treated with LY2405319 or
FGF21 up to a maximal dose of 50 nM (Figure 7).
Collectively, these data indicate that LY2405319 and FGF21
have comparable in vitro potency in both mouse and human cells,
and that Klb-dependence together with the non-mitogenic
character of FGF21 action remained intact in LY2405319
following protein engineering.
In vivo
Since FGF21 is known to induce metabolic actions in ob/ob and
diet induce obese C57BL6 (DIO) mice [1,20,21,24,29],
LY2405319 was next tested for pharmacological effects in both
animal strains.
When dosed chronically to ob/ob mice for 7 days via continuous
subcutaneous infusion, FGF21 and LY2405319 treatment resulted
in an effective lowering of glycemia that amounted to a normal￾ization of non-fasted glucose levels at the two highest doses
(Figure 8A & B). Comparative analysis of day 0 to 7 AUC (area

crude media using an FGF21 ELISA.

under the curve) of daily non-fasted glucose values revealed that
the efficacy profiles of FGF21 and LY2405319 at each comparable
dose were not significantly different (Figure 8C). Lowering of
plasma insulin was indistinguishable in animal cohorts that were
administered equivalent doses of FGF21 and LY2405319
(Figure 8D). In addition to glucose and insulin lowering, ob/ob
mice infused with 0.3 or 1 mg/kg doses of FGF21 or LY2405319
exhibited similar body weight loss of approximately 3–5%
(Figure 8E). Finally, levels of human FGF21 and LY2405319 in
mouse plasma were comparable at each dose and proportional to
the dose administered (Figure 8F) indicative that FGF21 and its
engineered variant have identical pharmacokinetic properties.
In DIO mice, FGF21 and LY2405319 led to a profound time￾and dose-dependent body weight reduction over two weeks of
administration. The degree of weight loss achieved was not
statistically different when comparing the same dose levels of each
molecule. At the highest dose, 1 mg/kg, net weight loss amounted
to approximately 30% of initial body mass (Figure 9A). This effect
was primarily a consequence of reduced adiposity (Figure 9B).
Neither FGF21 nor LY2405319 affected total food intake
(Figure 9C), as we have reported previously for FGF21 [20,24].
In fact, caloric consumption was elevated when normalized to
body weight changes, a finding also consistent with earlier results
[20]. Finally, LY2405319 treatment led to significant plasma
glucose lowering in the non-fasted state at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day
doses (Figure 9D). The net effects of LY2405319 and FGF21 on
plasma glucose in DIO mice were comparable but relatively minor
(about 30 mg/dL), even at the highest 1 mg/kg/day dose,
compared to more pronounced glucose lowering effects in ob/ob
mice (Figure 8A & B). This difference is likely a reflection of the
inability of FGF21 to induce hypoglycemia in animals [1]. Thus,
the relative window for an anti-glycemic effect in DIO animals is
smaller compared to ob/ob mice which present with a truly diabetic
phenotype. Regarding body weight effects, ob/ob mice were more
obese at baseline when compared to DIO mice; however, FGF21
and LY2405319 produced greater weight loss effects in DIO mice
(Figure 9A) likely due to the fact that FGF21 is known to be
ineffective in promoting energy expenditure in leptin-deficient
animals [30].
As measured by FGF21 ELISA at the end of the study in DIO
mice, the steady-state levels of plasma FGF21 and LY2405319
were proportional to the administered dose and comparable (data
not shown) similar to the findings in the ob/ob mouse experiment
(Figure 8F). Thus, the results of LY2405319 administration in two
strains of mice are consistent with known FGF21 pharmacology
[20,21], and the efficacy of LY2405319 was comparable to that of
FGF21.
Discussion
The goals of our engineering efforts were to identify a novel
FGF21 variant with improved pharmaceutical properties that
simultaneously maintains the selectivity, potency, and pharmacol￾ogy of FGF21 in the optimized molecule. Initially, we focused our

FGF1 (blue diamonds) to assess klotho cofactor-independent activity and 10 nM FGF23 (green inverted triangles) to assess Kl-specific activity. After
treatment, cells were lysed, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was measured using AlphaScreen technology. Values are presented as mean 6 SEM in

research on native FGF21 in order to carefully characterize its
physico-chemical properties and expression characteristics which
are important for development of a commercial product.
Characterization of FGF21 in biophysical screens showed that
the protein was prone to formation of insoluble protein aggregates
under physiologic conditions, particularly in a preserved formu￾lation format, i.e., in the presence of phenolic preservative required
for repeat dose administration of a daily parenteral product
(Figure 1). In addition, we demonstrated that the thermal stability
profile of FGF21 is suboptimal with evidence of unfolding
observed under physiological conditions (Figure 2A). In parallel
to improving the biophysical properties of FGF21, the molecule
was optimized for protein expression in yeast. The use of microbial
expression systems to support the manufacture of recombinant
protein therapeutics is well established and these systems,
primarily Escherichia coli and yeast, are leveraged to manufacture
products such as human insulin and growth hormone [31].
However, E. coli manufacturing processes are typically based on
the production of insoluble protein that requires denaturation and
refolding to achieve an active form. In contrast, Pichia pastoris can
be used to secrete properly folded and fully active recombinant
proteins into the culture medium thus making them amenable to
the types of manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce
mammalian-derived recombinant proteins such as monoclonal
antibodies. Such an expression system provides greater flexibility
and offers the potential for shorter expression periods, lower
manufacturing costs, and a more scalable expression process
compared to mammalian cell-based processes [32]. Therefore, we
elected to leverage the Pichia system for use in developing an
expression platform for an FGF21-based therapeutic protein.
Nevertheless, despite all the potential advantages of Pichia pastoris,
our attempts to express native FGF21 in this system were
compromised by poor yield and heterogeneity of the protein
product brought about by cleavage of the molecule in addition to
O-linked glycosylation.
In order to overcome the pharmaceutical limitations that were
evident with FGF21, a number of critical changes in the molecule
were designed and subsequently engineered. These efforts
culminated in the identification of LY2405319. The changes
featured in this analog include the addition of a new disulfide bond
(Leu118Cys-Ala134Cys) (Figure 3), deletion of the four N-terminal
amino acids, His-Pro-Ile-Pro, and an additional Ser167Ala point
mutation. Collectively, the engineering changes featured in
LY2405319 were associated with marked improvements in its
physical and conformational stability (Figure 2B), increased
compatibility with the preservative in m-cresol-containing for￾mulations (Figure 1), eliminated N-terminal proteolysis and
considerably reduced yeast-based O-link glycosylation. These
changes also ensured greater yields of homogeneous protein
material upon LY2405319 production in the Pichia pastoris
expression system (Figure 4).
Having identified LY2405319 as a novel biopharmaceutically
improved variant of FGF21, we next systematically profiled its
biologic activity in a series of in vitro and in vivo assays that had
been previously developed to characterize the biologic activity of
the native protein. Overall, LY2405319 appeared to produce an
identical degree of potency and selectivity compared to FGF21 in
cell-based assays which measured Klb-dependent activation of
FGF receptors. The activity of LY2405319 was also confirmed in
an adipocyte model of glucose uptake (Figure 6A & B) along with
its potency in liver derived cultured cells (Figure 6C), which
express endogenous FGF receptors and Klb. Importantly, we also
examined the mitogenic potential of LY2405319 and FGF21 in
HepG2 cells; however, both proteins at pharmacologic doses
showed no stimulation of proliferation (Figure 7). Both
LY2405319 and FGF21 were subsequently shown to exert nearly

fibroblasts (A) and differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes (B) by monitoring 2-Deoxy-D-[U-14C]-glucose accumulation and in human HepG2
hepatoma cells by examining relative expression of GLUT1 mRNA (C) after incubation for 3 h or 1 h, respectively, with various concentrations of
FGF21 (black squares) or LY2405319 (red triangles). Mean values 6 SEM are presented as fold relative to treatment with vehicle alone.

identical pharmacologic effects when administered to two distinct
mouse models of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Thus, we were able
to demonstrate that administration of LY2405319 produced
substantial effects in vivo to ameliorate hyperglycemia and to
reduce excess adiposity, similar to FGF21. The time course,
potency, and extent of efficacy observed with LY2405319 were
again nearly identical to observed effects obtained with FGF21
(Figures 8 & 9).
Other attempts to produce engineered human FGF21 variants
have recently been reported [28,33,34]. Notably, Mu et al.
described the introduction of a non-natural amino acid, p￾acetylphenylalanine, in the FGF21 sequence for the site-specific
attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG). They characterized
activities of their PEGylated FGF21 analogs using both cell-based
and animal studies which demonstrated a longer in vivo time-action
with a pharmacologic profile similar to that of native FGF21.
However, these novel PEGylated analogs did not retain the
potency of native FGF21, and their potential for undesired
mitogenic effects was not examined [33]. A different approach to
design an improved FGF21 analog has been communicated by
Veniant et al. This report describes the generation of a long-acting
FGF21 therapeutic by fusing an immunoglobulin Fc to an FGF21
variant containing two engineered mutations to reduce aggrega￾tion and in vivo degradation. Expectedly, the resulting FGF21-Fc
molecule had an improved half-life when dosed to mice or
monkeys, and it appeared to have in vivo effects that were generally
similar to FGF21 actions in animals [34]. Ye et al. describe
a mouse/human FGF21 chimera fused to SUMO protein. The
resulting SUMO-hmFGF21 was shown to exert some FGF21-like
efficacy in vitro and in vivo [28]. Taken together with our data,
these reports demonstrate that FGF21 can be manipulated in
a variety of ways to alter its physico-chemical properties in
addition to altering its in vivo time action. However, the signaling
properties, mitogenic potential, and other aspects of FGF21
pharmacology, as we have describe here for LY2405319, have not
been fully characterized with other engineered variants of FGF21

[28,33,34]. We have also further addressed the extent to which our
FGF21 analog exhibits enhanced stability and may be suitable for
larger scale expression-purification and subsequent clinical de￾velopment. Furthermore, our efforts succeeded in identifying
a molecule which closely mimics FGF21 in all respects including
in vivo potency, exposure and time action. The latter features may
be important since there might be undesired consequences of
continuous FGF21 action.
In conclusion, the studies reported herein resulted in the
identification and characterization of a novel variant of FGF21
which was shown to exhibit markedly improved biophysical
features and properties applicable to a multi-use formulation and
amenable to large-scale expression. The biologic features of
LY2405319 closely matched the profiles observed with FGF21,
resulting in a molecule that appears to be sufficiently optimized to
study the effects of LY2405319 pharmacologic administration in
human patients. Based on extensive studies which employed
exogenous native FGF21 in both rodent and non-human primate
disease models [1,19,21,24,29,33–37] and these additional results
obtained with LY2405319, there is a compelling rationale to
evaluate the potential therapeutic utility of FGF21-based mole￾cules in patients with cardio-metabolic disorders which include
metabolic syndrome, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis,
and atherosclerosis [38].
