Abstract
Background Chronic respiratory disease and inhaled corticosteroid
(ICS) therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
increase the risk of pneumonia. Few data are available on the
association of these risk factors with non-tuberculous mycobacterial
(NTM) pulmonary disease.
Methods This study examined chronic respiratory diseases and ICS
use as risk factors in a population-based case-control study
encompassing all adults in Denmark with microbiologically
confirmed NTM pulmonary disease between 1997 and 2008. The
study included 10 matched population controls per case.
Conditional logistic regression was used to compute adjusted ORs
for NTM pulmonary disease with regard to chronic respiratory
disease history.
Results Overall, chronic respiratory disease was associated with a
16.5-fold (95% CI 12.2 to 22.2) increased risk of NTM pulmonary
disease. The adjusted OR for NTM disease was 15.7 (95% CI 11.4 to
21.5) for COPD, 7.8 (95% CI 5.2 to 11.6) for asthma, 9.8 (95% CI


2.03 to 52.8) for pneumoconiosis, 187.5 (95% CI 24.8 to 1417.4)
for bronchiectasis, and 178.3 (95% CI 55.4 to 574.3) for
tuberculosis history. ORs were 29.1 (95% CI 13.3 to 63.8) for
patients with COPD on current ICS therapy and 7.6 (95% CI 3.4 to
16.8) for patients with COPD who had never received ICS therapy.
Among patients with COPD, ORs increased according to ICS dose,
from 28.1 for low-dose intake to 47.5 for high-dose intake (more
than 800 μg/day). The OR was higher for fluticasone than for
budesonide.
Conclusion Chronic respiratory disease, particularly COPD treated
with ICS therapy, is a strong risk factor for NTM pulmonary disease.
