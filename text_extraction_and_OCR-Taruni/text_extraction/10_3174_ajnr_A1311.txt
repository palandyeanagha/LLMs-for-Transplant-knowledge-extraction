SUMMARY: Reversible encephalopathy after transplantation is well recognized. The condition is com￾monly thought to be related to immune suppression, and a characteristic brain imaging pattern is
typically recognized with vasogenic edema in the parietal and occipital regions, typically termed
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). We report the case of a patient with reversible
encephalopathy after cardiac transplantation with brain biopsy evidence of endothelial activation,
selective intravascular/perivascular T-cell trafficking, and VEGF expression in astrocytes, neurons, and
the endothelium.
Reversible encephalopathy after transplantation is well rec￾ognized. A characteristic brain-imaging pattern is typi￾cally seen with vasogenic edema in the parietal and occipital
regions, typically termed posterior reversible encephalopathy
syndrome (PRES). We report the case of a patient with revers￾ible encephalopathy after cardiac transplantation with brain
biopsy evidence of endothelial activation, selective intravascu￾lar/perivascular T-cell trafficking, and endothelial/cellular
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.
Case Report
The patient is a 57-year-old man status postorthotopic heart trans￾plantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Routine cardiac biopsy re￾sults were normal until 5 months after the transplantation when mild
rejection was noted (grade I). One month later, he experienced altered
mentation concerning for tacrolimus toxicity, rejection, or infection.
Empiric antibiotics and antiviral agents were initiated, but results of
work-up for bacterial and virus infections, including lumbar punc￾ture and blood cultures, were negative, and serum tacrolimus levels
were within normal limits (13.2 ng/mL; laboratory upper limit of
normal, 16 ng/mL). The patient clinically improved and was dis￾charged to home.
One week later, he again presented with confusion. Results of
repeated blood cultures and lumbar puncture were negative. On day
5, he experienced a grand mal seizure. At that time, white blood cell
count was 3.4  103 L1 (77% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 8%
bands, 10% lymphocytes), platelet count was 190  103 L1
, and
serum glucose level was 80 mg/dL. Emergent outside CT suggested a
“subacute stroke,” and he was transferred to the University Hospital
for further management.
On transfer, the patient was lethargic and febrile (102.1°F) but
with normal blood pressure readings (range, 114 –138/41– 66 mm
Hg). Brain MR imaging examination demonstrated bifrontal signal
intensity abnormality (Fig 1A) consistent with vasogenic edema with￾out restricted diffusion or infarction. Concern remained high for un￾derlying infection; antibiotics were reinstated.
After 6 days, some clinical improvement was noted, but seizure
activity persisted and a second MR imaging examination continued to
demonstrate bifrontal edema. A positive stool toxin for Clostridium
difficile was identified, but results of comprehensive infection
work-up (blood/urine/CSF) remained otherwise negative. Concern
at this point included undefined brain infection or possible posttrans￾plant lymphoproliferative disease, and it was elected to perform a
biopsy of the frontal lobe lesion on the right.
Histologic examination demonstrated evidence of endothelial ac￾tivation, diffuse vasogenic edema, reactive astrocytes, and reactive
microglia (Fig 2A and B). Results of leukocyte common antigen stain
demonstrated T-cell (CD3 antigen positive) specific trafficking with
intravascular, transmural, and perivascular T-lymphocytes (Fig 3).
T-cell trafficking was nonselective with both helper (CD4) and cyto￾toxic (CD8) subtypes represented. Results of specific antibody stain￾ing VEGF and in situ hybridization for VEGF messenger RNA were
also positive (Fig 4).
Trafficking leukocytes were not B-cells (CD20), and no polymor￾phonuclear cells, monocytes, or macrophages were identified on he￾matoxylin-eosin sections. Focal lymphocyte accumulation was not
present.
Tacrolimus was empirically switched to cyclosporine, the patient’s
mental status continued to improve, and he was discharged to home.
Follow-up MR imaging examination 1 month after discharge (Fig 1B)
demonstrated near-complete reversal of the bifrontal vasogenic
edema.
Discussion
Because most cases of reversible encephalopathy are diag￾nosed solely by clinical and radiologic findings, reports de￾scribing histologic findings in the acute phase of toxicity are
not common. Of those, some are in the postmortem setting
where the pathologic process was severe; in such cases, diffuse
white matter edema with thrombotic microangiopathy, isch￾emia, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration were de￾scribed.1,2 Reports of biopsy being performed on material in
the premortem setting have generally shown vasogenic white

Axial MR fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image obtained
at toxicity demonstrates vasogenic edema in the frontal lobes
bilaterally (arrows). Minor small-vessel disease changes
were also present (arrowhead). Diffusion sequence demon￾strated T2 shinethrough, but true restricted diffusion was not
present. B, Axial MR fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
image obtained 1 month after right frontal lobe biopsy
demonstrates near-complete resolution of the edema in the
left frontal lobe (large arrow). Postbiopsy changes are
present in the right frontal lobe (small arrows) with resolution
of the previously present vasogenic edema deep to the
biopsy changes. Residual small-vessel disease changes are
again noted (arrowhead).
Fig 2. Early microscopic pathologic features of reversible
encephalopathy, hematoxylin-eosin stain. A, Hematoxylin￾eosin–stained sections showed many small blood vessels
with reactive endothelial cells (black arrow) in the white
matter demonstrating cellular and nuclear enlargement as
well as mild interstitial edema (white arrow). Some vessels
appeared nonreactive and are visible as a comparison (ar￾rowhead). No vasculitis, demyelination, or axonal swelling
was seen. Some scattered erythrocytes are present from the
biopsy procedure, but no hemosiderin-laden macrophages
were seen. B, These reactive blood vessels were also present
in the gray matter, seen adjacent to a neuron (arrow), along
with reactive astrocytes (arrowheads).

encephalopathy on immunohistochemical examination. A,
CD45 (leukocyte common antigen) shows scattered lympho￾cytes in the intravascular (arrowhead) and perivascular (ar￾row) areas. The vessels identified by the arrows are shown
in higher magnification in Figs B and C. B, Higher magnifi￾cation of arrowhead in Fig 3A. Lymphocytes (T-cells) are
regularly noted within the intravascular space (arrows) sur￾rounded by endothelium (arrowhead). Other leukocytes (poly￾morphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, macrophages) were
not identified, suggesting selective T-lymphocyte adherence.
C, Higher magnification of arrowhead in Fig 3A. Lymphocytes
(T-cells) have traversed the endothelium (end point of the
lymphocyte trafficking process) and are in the perivascular
space (arrow). D, These lymphocytes were CD3-positive T￾cells (arrow). No CD20-positive B-cells were present, and
CD68 immunostaining identified only a modest number of
activated microglia with no macrophages (not shown).
Results of immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies were negative for toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Epstein-Barr virus, and JC virus (not shown). Results of
tissue cultures were also negative.

matter edema, perivascular lymphocytes, reactive astrocyto￾sis,3-6 and perivascular macrophages.7,8 Endothelial immuno￾reactivity to tumor necrosis factor-alpha has been demon￾strated.4 Some white matter pallor has been attributed to
demyelination,9 but this feature more likely represents focally
pronounced edema.4 The case of our patient suggests that en￾dothelial activation (with subsequent edema) and perivascular
trafficking of T-cells play important roles in the pathogenesis
of reversible encephalopathy.
The classic form of reversible encephalopathy is PRES, typ￾ically demonstrating vasogenic edema in the parieto-occipital
region, frontal lobes, temporo-occipital junction, and cerebel￾lum,10 but other reversible states or presentations are recog￾nized, including isolated brain stem or basal ganglion edema
and reversible lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum.11,12
PRES is recognized after transplantation but is also seen in other
complex systemic processes including preeclampsia/eclampsia,
infection/sepsis/shock, autoimmune disease, and postcancer
chemotherapy. Although the mechanism is as yet unproven, the
associated conditions have immune-related antigenic challenge
as a common characteristic.13
The current case has elements of classic posttransplant
neurotoxicity (altered mentation, reversible brain edema, re￾cent mild rejection) lacking only the typical PRES edema dis￾tribution. Indeed, this unusual pattern was the main reason
biopsy was performed. Histologic demonstration of T-cell,
but not B-cell, trafficking (intravascular, transmural, perivas￾cular T-cells) suggests selective T-cell activation, whereas
VEGF (previously vascular permeability factor) expression,
likewise, suggests tissue hypoxemia and is likely responsible
for the vasogenic edema.
No evidence of local brain infection to account for the T￾cell response was identified (histologic examination, immu￾nohistochemical examination, tissue culture). Results of sys￾temic testing for bacterial and virus infection were negative.
A mechanism for the developing vasogenic edema has
been proposed on the basis of T-cell activation: endothelial cell
activation or injury, T-cell trafficking, plus-or-minus super￾imposed vasoconstriction with resultant hypoperfusion or
hypoxemia, VEGF expression, and increased endothelial per￾meability.13 Endothelial activation (histologically endothelial
cell and nucleus enlargement) and selective T-cell trafficking
could certainly lead to restricted brain blood flow with re￾duced perfusion and hypoxemia. In this case, recent low-grade
rejection (reaction to transplant endothelium) or the presence
of colon flora imbalance with C difficile might have been the
foreign protein antigen source that led to this pathologic se￾quence of events. The findings in this case suggest that revers￾ible encephalopathy after transplantation may be because of
an aberrant T-cell mediated immune response.
