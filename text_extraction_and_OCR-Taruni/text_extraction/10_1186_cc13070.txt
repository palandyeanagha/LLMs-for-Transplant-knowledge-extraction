Abstract
Introduction: Presepsin levels are known to be increased in sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early
diagnostic and prognostic value of Presepsin compared with procalcitonin (PCT), Mortality in Emergency
Department Sepsis (MEDS) score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score in septic
patients in an emergency department (ED) and to investigate Presepsin as a new biomarker of sepsis.
Methods: This study enrolled 859 consecutive patients with at least two diagnostic criteria for systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) who were admitted to Beijing Chao-yang Hospital ED from December 2011
to October 2012, and 100 age-matched healthy controls. Patients were stratified into four groups: SIRS, sepsis, severe
sepsis, and septic shock. Plasma Presepsin and serum PCT were measured, and MEDS score and APACHE II score
were calculated at enrollment. Comparisons were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests.
Results: On admission, the median levels of plasma Presepsin increased with sepsis severity. The areas under the
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curves of Presepsin were greater than those of PCT in diagnosing sepsis, and
predicting severe sepsis and septic shock. The AUC of Presepsin for predicting 28-day mortality in septic patients
was slightly lower than that of PCT, MEDS score and APACHE II score. The AUC of a combination of Presepsin and
MEDS score or APACHE II score was significantly higher than that of MEDS score or APACHE II score alone in predicting
severe sepsis, and was markedly higher than that of Presepsin alone in predicting septic shock and 28-day mortality in
septic patients, respectively. Plasma Presepsin levels in septic patients were significantly higher in non-survivors than in
survivors at 28 days’ follow-up. Presepsin, MEDS score and APACHE II score were found to be independent predictors
of severe sepsis, septic shock and 28-day mortality in septic patients. The levels of plasma Presepsin were positively
correlated with PCT, MEDS score and APACHE II score in every septic group.
Conclusion: Presepsin is a valuable biomarker for early diagnosis of sepsis, risk stratification, and evaluation of
prognosis in septic patients in the ED.
Introduction
Sepsis still represents a major cause of morbidity and mor￾tality in critically ill patients despite the use of modern an￾tibiotics and resuscitation therapies [1]. There is a lack of
early diagnosis and timely intervention for sepsis in the
emergency department (ED), and recent interest has fo￾cused on biomarkers for early diagnosis, risk stratification,
and evaluation of prognosis of sepsis.
CD14, the high-affinity receptor for lipopolysaccharide/
lipopolysaccharide binding protein complexes, is a glycopro￾tein expressed in macrophage, monocyte, and granulocyte
cells and their cell membranes [2]. The lipopolysacchar￾ide–lipopolysaccharide binding protein–CD14 complex is
released into circulation by shedding of CD14 from the cell
membrane, yielding soluble CD14. Presepsin (soluble
CD14-ST), a novel biomarker for diagnosing sepsis, is a
subtype of soluble CD14, and is a 13 kDa protein that is a
truncated N-terminal fragment of CD14 [3].
Although some clinical studies confirmed that plasma
presepsin levels were significantly increased in septic pa￾tients, and were positively correlated with the severity of
sepsis, the sample sizes were relatively small [4-9], and
these findings have not yet been corroborated in a large
number of septic patients in the ED. The aim of this study
was to investigate the clinical value of presepsin in early
diagnosis, risk stratification and prognostic evaluation of

sepsis in a large sample of septic patients in a hospital ED,
and to compare it with the prognostic value of procalcito￾nin (PCT), the Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis
(MEDS) score and the Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score.
Methods
Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria
This prospective study was conducted in the ED of
Beijing Chao-yang Hospital, a university teaching hos￾pital with approximately 240,000 to 260,000 ED admis￾sions per year. From December 2011 to October 2012,
consecutive patients who fulfilled the criteria for sepsis
as defined by the American College of Chest Physicians/
Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) were
enrolled [10]. Patients were classified at the time of en￾rollment as having sterile systemic inflammatory re￾sponse syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis and septic
shock, according to ACCP/SCCM criteria [10].
Exclusion criteria were as follows: <18 years old, ter￾minal stage of disease (malignant cancer of any type, ac￾quired immunodeficiency syndrome, end-stage liver or
renal disease), and the patient or relatives did not con￾sent to inclusion. Finally, after excluding 92 patients
who did not meet the inclusion criteria and 49 patients
who were lost to follow-up, 859 patients were enrolled
and were followed for 28 days or until death. At the
same time, 100 age-matched healthy individuals were
enrolled as controls. This study was approved by the
Beijing Chao-yang Hospital Ethics Committee. Written
informed consent was obtained from every subject.
Establishment of infection
The infections of different diseases in our study were
clinically established on the basis of clinical features, la￾boratory findings, and imaging tests according to criteria
of the International Sepsis Forum Consensus Conference
on Definitions of Infection [11]. For example, the diag￾nosis of community-acquired pneumonia was mainly
based on a new infiltrate plus at least one recently ac￾quired respiratory symptom (cough, sputum production,
dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic pain) or sign (auscultatory
findings of abnormal breath sounds and rales). Intra￾abdominal infections comprised the following diseases
in our study: the diagnosis of peritonitis was based on
clinical findings including abdominal pain, tenderness to
palpation, and peritoneal signs such as rigidity or re￾bound tenderness, which were supported by radio￾graphic findings, such as free air under the diaphragm
or localized fluid collection visualized by computed tom￾ography with a compatible clinical illness; the diagnosis
of biliary tract infection was on the basis of clinical evi￾dence of biliary tract infection with surgical or radio￾graphic evidence of supportive complications; typhlitis
was diagnosed according to a compatible clinical presen￾tation with radiographic evidence of bowel wall edema
and/or gas and/or hemorrhagic necrosis within the bowel
wall of the cecum; and the diagnosis of pyelonephritis was
based on clinical features (fever (>38°C), urgency, localized
pain or tenderness at involved site), and pyuria, hematuria,
and radiographic evidence of infection. Skin and soft-tissue
infections (cellulitis) were suggested by the presence of a
rapidly expanding erythema, local tenderness, pain, swell￾ing, lymphangitis, and lymphadenopathy, which is fre￾quently accompanied by systemic signs and symptoms
including malaise, fever (temperature >38.0°C), and chills.
Determination of bacterial meningitis was based on com￾patible clinical features, and cerebrospinal fluid findings
(cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count >1,000/mm3
) [12].
Data collection
Subject data including name, age, sex, past medical his￾tory and vital signs were recorded at enrollment. Labo￾ratory examinations, including whole blood leukocyte
counts, blood gas analysis, blood biochemistry, X-ray
scans and others, were carried out within 24 hours.
Venous blood samples were obtained at ED admission
and collected in tubes containing heparin or ethylenedi￾amine tetraacetate and stored at –80°C after collection for
analysis within 24 hours. Plasma presepsin concentrations
were determined with a compact automated immunoana￾lyzer (PATHFAST; Mitsubishi Chemical Medience Cor￾poration, Tokyo, Japan) based on a chemiluminescent
enzyme immunoassay [5,6,13], and the assay results were
obtained within 17 minutes. This assay has a normal refer￾ence range of 60 to 365 pg/ml.
PCT was measured by a BioMerieux Mini VIDAS im￾munoassay analyzer (Block Scientific, Bohemia, NY, USA)
in serum samples. Serum was separated by centrifugation
at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes and analyzed within 24 hours.
The upper and lower detection limits were 200.0 ng/ml
and 0.05 ng/ml, respectively.
The MEDS score and APACHE II score were calcu￾lated according to age, past medical history, vital signs
and laboratory results [14,15] when the patients were
admitted to the ED.
Septic patients were classified into surviving and non￾surviving groups according to 28-day survival. The en￾rolled septic patients who died from all causes within
the follow-up time were considered nonsurvivors.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed by SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Plasma presepsin levels, serum PCT
levels, MEDS score and APACHE II score had skewed
distributions and were expressed as the median (25th to
75th percentile). For multi-group comparisons, Kruskal–
Wallis one-way analysis of variance was applied, and

two-group comparisons were performed nonparametri￾cally using the Mann–Whitney U test. To compare the
predictive value of presepsin, PCT, MEDS score and APA￾CHE II score for severe sepsis, septic shock and 28-day
mortality, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
were constructed and the areas under the ROC curves
(AUCs) were determined. The outcome variable was
28-day mortality. On the basis of optimal thresholds deter￾mined according to ROC curve analysis, prognostic pa￾rameters (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood
ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR–)) were also
calculated. For comparisons of AUCs, the Z-test formula
was applied:
Z ¼ ð Þ A1‐A2 = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
SE1
2 þ SE2
2 p
The test standard was Z0.05 = 1.96, Z0.01 = 2.58. Binary
logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the
independent predictors of severe sepsis, septic shock,
and 28-day mortality. All statistical tests were two-tailed,
and P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Spearman correlation analysis was applied to determine
the correlation between presepsin, PCT, MEDS score
and APACHE II score.
Results
Characteristics of enrolled subjects
Between December 2011 and October 2012, 859 patients
in the ED of Beijing Chao-yang Hospital and 100 healthy
controls were enrolled in this study. No significant dif￾ferences were found in age, sex and correlative diseases
among the five groups (SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic
shock, and control groups). The characteristics, diseases
and associated infections in enrolled subjects are pre￾sented in Table 1.
Comparison of median levels of presepsin, procalcitonin,
MEDS score and APACHE II score
The median presepsin levels, PCT levels, MEDS score and
APACHE II score in each group are shown in Table 1.
Plasma presepsin, serum PCT, MEDS score and APACHE
II score at ED admission were significantly different
among these groups. Compared with the healthy control
group, presepsin and PCT levels were significantly higher
in patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and septic
shock (P <0.0001), and presepsin levels, PCT levels and

Correlation of plasma presepsin levels with serum
procalcitonin levels, MEDS score and APACHE II score in
septic patients
Spearman correlation analysis of presepsin with PCT,
MEDS score and APACHE II score showed that, com￾pared with PCT, MEDS score and APACHE II score, the
correlation coefficients of presepsin were 0.502, 0.414
and 0.294 (all P <0.0001), respectively, which suggested
significantly positive correlations.
Discussion
Despite the use of antimicrobial agents and advanced life
support, the case fatality rate for patients with sepsis has
remained between 20 and 30% during the past two de￾cades [16,17].
Biomarkers play a pivotal pole in early diagnosis, dif￾ferential diagnosis, risk stratification, therapy monitoring
and evaluation of prognosis of sepsis. Presepsin, gener￾ated by circulating plasma proteases activating cleavage
of soluble CD14 [18], is a novel biomarker that has been
used for diagnosis of sepsis in recent years, and its pro￾duction is associated with phagocytosis and cleavage of
microorganisms by lysosomal enzymes [19].
In this study, we found that presepsin levels increased in
early sepsis, and that the levels were significantly higher
than in healthy controls and in SIRS patients, which was
in accordance with previous results [4,5,9]. In addition,
with progression of sepsis, the plasma presepsin levels

increased accordingly, and reached the highest levels in
septic shock. The present study demonstrated that plasma
presepsin levels were a good parameter for reflecting the
severity of sepsis.
More recently, PCT has also been used widely as a bio￾marker for sepsis diagnosis, risk stratification, evaluation
of prognosis, and therapy monitoring. Most studies that
have examined the discriminative ability of serum PCT in
the diagnosis of sepsis have been small, with heterogeneity
in the patients enrolled, and have used different cutoff
values, and hence have provided variable results [20]. In
this study, the cutoff value of PCT for diagnosing sepsis
according to the ROC curve was 0.25 ng/ml, lower than
that (0.5 ng/ml) commonly used in clinical settings
[21,22]. Possible reasons for the difference were as follows:
first, the SIRS and septic patients were enrolled according
to ACCP/SCCM criteria, not PCT, which was only consid￾ered as a comparative index; second, the site of infection
in the majority of enrolled patients was located in the
lower respiratory tract, thus the PCT cutoff level of
0.25 ng/ml was usually used for diagnosing low respiratory
tract infection [23,24]; third, the septic patients were
enrolled and blood samples were obtained at the time of
ED admission, when the concentration of PCT had not
increased fully or reached a maximum; and fourth, the
septic patients may have been treated with antimicrobial
agents outside hospital, which may affect the results for
PCT, as well as those for presepsin. Furthermore, the me￾dian levels of PCT in the present study were lower than
the commonly used cutoff values in different clinical
settings (Table 1), and the cutoff level of presepsin
(317 pg/ml) was lower than the previously reported cutoff
values of 400 to 600 pg/ml for diagnosing sepsis [5,9].
Although serum PCT can be used as a biomarker in
the diagnosis of sepsis, PCT is also increased in other
conditions, such as multiple trauma, extensive burns,
pancreatitis, organ transplantation, major surgery, and
SIRS, but not in infection [25], and its PPV and NPV
values are not sufficient to rule in or rule out sepsis in a
standalone test. A recent meta-analysis found that the
diagnostic performance of PCT was low, with 71% (95%
confidence interval 67 to 76%) sensitivity and specificity
for serum PCT as a biomarker of sepsis. PCT therefore
cannot reliably differentiate sepsis from other conditions
in critically ill adult patients [26].
Compared with PCT, presepsin is a highly specific bio￾marker for diagnosing bacterial infections because it is
produced in association with bacterial phagocytosis.

Presepsin was shown to be secreted from granulocytes
by infectious stimuli in an animal sepsis model [19]. In
this study, ROC analysis of a large sample of septic pa￾tients at ED admission demonstrated that presepsin was
superior to PCT and showed higher sensitivity, spe￾cificity, PPV, NPV and predictive accuracy in the early
diagnosis of sepsis, which was in line with previous re￾ports [4,5,9].
There was higher mortality as the severity of sepsis in￾creased, and more than 50% mortality in severe sepsis
[17]. Dellinger and colleagues, in the Early-Goal Directed
Therapy in 2013 Guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Cam￾paign [27], recommended that a potential infection source
should be confirmed as promptly as possible within the
first 6 hours of presentation and that broad-spectrum anti￾biotic treatment must be administered within 1 hour after
the recognition of severe sepsis and septic shock. Early
identification of these high-risk patients is therefore cru￾cial. In this study, ROC analysis showed that the AUC of
presepsin (0.840) was markedly higher than that of PCT
(0.741) (P <0.01) and displayed higher sensitivity (82.4%)
and NPV (83.2%) in predicting severe sepsis. Meanwhile,
in logistic regression analysis, presepsin was found to be
an independent predictor of severe sepsis, but PCT was
not, which further indicated that presepsin was superior
to PCT in predicting severe sepsis.
Meanwhile, presepsin demonstrated high sensitivity
(85.7%) and high NPV (96.3%) in predicting septic
shock, and plasma presepsin levels lower than the
above-mentioned cutoff value (550 pg/ml) may help rule
out the possibility of septic shock. Additionally, in the
logistic regression analysis, presepsin and PCT were
found to be independent predictors of septic shock in
septic patients, which indicated presepsin and PCT had
certain value in predicting septic shock.
Scoring systems are also widely applied to risk stratifi￾cation and prediction of prognosis in septic patients. In
the present study, we found that MEDS score and APA￾CHE II score increased along with progression of sepsis,
reaching a maximum in septic shock. Similarly, MEDS
score and APACHE II score were also a good parameter
to reflect the severity of sepsis.
In this study, we further found that presepsin, PCT,
MEDS score and APACHE II score were statistically sig￾nificant for predicting severe sepsis, septic shock and
28-day mortality (all P <0.0001). The AUC of presepsin
in combination with MEDS score or APACHE II score
was significantly higher than MEDS score or APACHE II
score alone in predicting severe sepsis (P <0.01), and al￾though there was no difference compared with presepsin
alone (all P >0.05), presepsin in combination with MEDS
score or APACHE II score markedly increased AUC
(0.875 or 0.858, respectively), which indicated that the
combination of presepsin with MEDS score or APACHE
II score obviously improved the accuracy of predicting
severe sepsis.
Meanwhile, we also found the AUC of presepsin in
combination with MEDS score or APACHE II score was
significantly higher than presepsin alone in predicting
septic shock (P <0.01). Although there was no difference
compared with MEDS score or APACHE II score alone
(all P >0.05), presepsin in combination with MEDS score
or APACHE II score significantly increased the AUC
(0.924 or 0.868, respectively). In addition, the AUC of
presepsin in combination with MEDS score was signifi￾cantly higher than that of presepsin in combination with
APACHE II score (P <0.05). Taken together, combin￾ation presepsin with MEDS score or APACHE II score
markedly enhanced the accuracy of predicting septic
shock, and the combination of presepsin with MEDS
score was superior to the combination of presepsin with
APACHE II score in predicting septic shock.
Although the AUC of presepsin was slightly lower than
that of PCT and MEDS score in predicting 28-day mortal￾ity in septic patients, no significant differences were found.
However, the AUC of presepsin in combination with
MEDS score or APACHE II score was significantly higher
than presepsin alone (all P <0.01). Although the sensitivity
(62.2%), the specificity (66.8%), the PPV (48.3%), and the
NPV (78%) were a little low for presepsin for predicting
28-day mortality in septic patients, in the logistic regres￾sion analysis presepsin, MEDS score and APACHE II
score were found to be independent predictors of 28-day
mortality in septic patients, while PCT was not – this is in
accordance with previous results from Ruiz-Alvarez and
colleagues [28], suggesting presepsin was superior to PCT
for predicting 28-day mortality in septic patients, and the
combination of presepsin with MEDS score or APACHE
II score significantly enhanced the accuracy of predicting
28-day mortality in septic patients.
Additionally, Spearman correlation analysis of presep￾sin found a significantly positive correlation with MEDS
score and APACHE II score, indicating that presepsin,
MEDS score and APACHE II score may facilitate evalu￾ation of the severity of sepsis and allow effective risk
stratification, as presepsin in combination with MEDS
score or APACHE II score further enhanced the accur￾acy of evaluation of septic patients.
The median levels of presepsin were significantly
higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors, which further
confirmed that the higher the plasma presepsin level, the
more adverse the outcome in septic patients. The plasma
presepsin level was also a good index for evaluation of
prognosis in septic patients.
Limitations
Although the present study contained a relatively large
sample size, some limitations merit consideration. First,
Liu et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R244 Page 10 of 12

it was a single-center study and did not compare with
other biomarkers and severity score systems. Second, be￾cause it was difficult to obtain pathogen samples in an
emergency room setting, blood culture and sputum sam￾ple were not taken and tested, and sepsis was established
on the basis of clinical features, laboratory findings and
imaging tests according to criteria for sepsis as defined
by ACCP/SCCM.
Conclusions
This study indicated that presepsin was a more valuable
biomarker than PCT in the early diagnosis of sepsis, and
presepsin in combination with MEDS score or APACHE
II score significantly increased the prognostic accuracy
in septic patients. Presepsin thus appears to be a promis￾ing biomarker and is superior to PCT for early diagnosis
of sepsis, and risk stratification and evaluation of prog￾nosis in septic patients in the ED.
Key messages
 Plasma presepsin levels were a good parameter for
reflecting the severity of sepsis and evaluating
prognosis of septic patients.
 Presepsin was superior to PCT for diagnosing sepsis,
and predicting severe sepsis, septic shock and
28-day mortality in septic patients in the ED.
 Presepsin, MEDS score and APACHE II score were
all independent predictors of severe sepsis, septic
shock and 28-day mortality in septic patients.
 Presepsin in combination MEDS score or APACHE
II score markedly enhanced the predictive accuracy
of predicting severe sepsis, septic shock and 28-day
mortality in septic patients.
