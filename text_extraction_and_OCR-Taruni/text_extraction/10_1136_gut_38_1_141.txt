Abstract
From January 1990 to June 1994, 53
patients who sustained bile duct injuries
during laparoscopic cholecystectomy
were treated at the Amsterdam Academic
Medical Centre. There were 16 men and
37 women with a mean age of 47 years.
Follow up was established in all patients
for a median of 17 months. Four types of
ductal injury were identified. Type A (18
patients) had leakage from cystic ducts or
peripheral hepatic radicles, type B (11
patients) had major bile duct leakage,
type C (nine patients) had an isolated
ductal stricture, and type D (15 patients)
had complete transection of the bile duct.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan￾creatography (ERCP) established the
diagnosis in all type A, B, and C lesions.
In type D lesions percutaneous cholangio￾graphy was required to delineate the
proximal extent of the injury. Initial
treatment (until resolution of symptoms
and discharge from hospital) comprised
endoscopy in 36 patients and surgery in
26 patients. Endoscopic treatment was
possible and successful in 16 of 18 of type
A lesions, five of seven of type B lesions,
and three of nine of type C lesions. Most
failures resulted from inability to pass
strictures or leaks at the initial
endoscopy. During initial treatment
additional surgery was required in seven
patients. Fourteen patients underwent
percutaneous or surgical drainage of bile
collections, or both. After endoscopic
treatment early complications occurred
in three patients, with a fatal outcome
in two (not related to the endoscopic
therapy). During follow up six patients
developed late complications. All 15
patients with complete transection and
four patients with major bile duct leakage
were initially treated surgically. During
initial treatment additional endoscopy
was required in two patients. Early com￾plications occurred in eight patients.
During follow up seven patients devel￾oped stenosis of the anastomosis or bile
duct. Reconstructive surgery in the early
postoperative phase was associated with
more complications than elective recon￾structive surgery. Most type A and B bile
duct injuries after laparoscopic cholecys￾tectomy (80%) can be treated endoscopi￾cally. In patients with more severe ductal
injury (type C and D) reconstructive
surgery is eventually required in 700/0.
Multidisciplinary approach to these
lesions is advocated and algorithms for
treatment are proposed.

In the past four years laparoscopic cholecystec￾tomy has gained widespread acceptance
among surgeons and the public and has
replaced conventional 'open' cholecystectomy
as treatment of choice for symptomatic chole￾cystolithiasis. Several large multicentre
studieslA have shown the efficacy and overall
safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Com￾pared with 'open' cholecystectomy, laparo￾scopic cholecystectomy is associated with less
postoperative pain, shorter stay in hospital and
recovery, earlier return to work, and a better
abdominal cosmetic outcome.5 Laparoscopic
cholecystectomy does, however, carry an
increased risk for biliary tract injury.6 Several
series have been published describing the
serious morbidity and mortality of these
injuries.7 11 Comparatively few papers,9 12
however, have focused on treatment of bile
duct injuries once they have occurred.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the
diagnosis and treatment of bile duct lesions
after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to pro￾pose algorithms for treatment of these compli￾cations.
Methods
Patients
From January 1990 to June 1994, 53 patients
were at least partially treated at the Academic
Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands,
for bile duct lesions sustained during laparo￾scopic cholecystectomy. In 48 patients (91%)
the laparoscopic cholecystectomy was per￾formed in one of 32 referring hospitals, five
patients (one transection and four bile leaks)
had their laparoscopic intervention at the
Amsterdam Academic Medical Centre. There
were 16 men and 37 women with a mean age
of 47 years (range 22-89).
Study analysis
The study included a retrospective evaluation
of the initial laparoscopic procedure, present￾ing symptoms of the bile duct lesion, classifi￾cation and site of the ductal injury, diagnostic
procedures and therapeutic interventions
before and after referral, and follow up to date.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was defined as
any attempt at cholecystectomy begun as a
laparoscopic procedure regardless of whether
the procedure was converted to an open chole￾cystectomy or if the injury occurred after con￾version. Laparoscopic bile duct injury was
defined as any clinically evident damage to the
biliary system (including the cystic duct),
occurring at any time after laparoscopic chole￾cystectomy without any other probable cause.
Exclusion criteria included patients with
common bile duct stones or biliary neoplasia
but without disruption of the biliary system.
Sources of information
Information concerning the initial laparoscopic
procedure was obtained from both the opera￾tive report and personal interview with the
surgeon. Presenting symptoms of the bile duct
injury and results of diagnostic or therapeutic
interventions performed at referring centres, or
both, were obtained from referral notes, local
medical charts, and interviews with referring
physicians. Patients were followed up at the
outpatient clinic of our institution at regular
intervals. If the patient had been discharged
from further follow up or when follow up was
performed by local physicians (in general for
less serious bile duct injuries or after one to two
year event free follow up) information was
obtained from general practitioners and the
patients themselves. Follow up was established
up to August 1994 in all patients.
Classification of the bile duct injuries
We identified four types of bile duct injury:
type A: cystic duct leaks or leakage from
aberrant or peripheral hepatic radicles, type B:
major bile duct leaks with or without concomi￾tant biliary strictures, type C: bile duct stric￾tures without bile leakage, and type D:
complete transection of the duct with or with￾out excision of some portion of the biliary tree.
The site of the ductal lesion was determined by
its most proximal border.
Definitions
Initial treatment was defined as all therapeutic
interventions performed from diagnosis of the
lesion until complete resolution of symptoms
and discharge from the hospital. Early compli￾cations comprised all complications occurring
during initial treatment. Late complications
were defined as all complications occurring
during follow up after initial treatment was
established. Secondary treatment comprised
all therapeutic interventions performed
because of late complications.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
The indication for laparoscopic cholecystec￾tomy was uncomplicated symptomatic gall
stone disease in most patients (Table I). Only a
limited number of patients had an indication
generally considered a risk factor for complica￾tions after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.13
'Uncomplicated' laparoscopic cholecystec￾tomy was reported in 25 patients (47%),
whereas in 28 patients technical problems were
encountered during surgery (Table II). Of
these 28 laparoscopic procedures with tech￾nical problems, only four (14%) were con￾verted to an open technique because of these
problems. We did not attempt to discover if in
these cases the actual ductal lesion occurred
before or after the conversion. In six additional
cases the procedure was converted to an open
cholecystectomy because iatrogenic lesions of
the biliary tract were suspected. Therefore, the
total number of conversions was 10 of 53
(19%). Intraoperative cholangiography was
performed in two patients (4%).
Clinical presentation
Six bile duct injuries were identified at the time
of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the
remaining 47 patients the ductal lesions pre￾sented postoperatively, one day to 93 weeks
(median three days) after the initial laparoscopic
procedure. Clinical presentation varied widely
and was primary influenced by the type of injury
(Table III). Bile leaks, either resulting from
minor bile duct laceration (type A lesion), major
bile duct laceration (type B lesion), or complete
transection (type D lesion), tended to differ in
clinical presentation from ductal strictures with￾out bile leakage (type C lesion). This last group
had a longer symptom free interval after the
laparoscopic cholecystectomy (median of 57
days versus three days) and presented more
often with signs of biliary obstruction (for
example, jaundice, cholestatic liver function
tests, dilatation of the proximal biliary tree on
ultrasound, Table III). In contrast with isolated
strictures, bile leaks presented in a less uniform
way. Symptoms in the early postoperative phase
were comparatively aspecific with general
malaise, low grade fever, marginally increased
liver function tests, and absence of dilatation on
radiological imaging. More specific and severe
symptoms such as jaundice, sepsis, and ileus
were more frequently found in patients with bile
leakage but these usually only became manifest
several days after the initial operation.

Diagnostic procedures
Abdominal ultrasound was performed in 37 of
47 patients in whom the lesion was noted post￾operatively and showed fluid collections in
63% and dilatation of the biliary tract in 29%
of patients. In 10 patients fluid collections
were punctured percutaneously under ultra￾sound guidance.
ERCP was performed in 45 patients and
established the diagnosis in all type A, B, and
C lesions. Although in type D lesions retro￾grade cholangiography showed a total stop
and was thus of diagnostic importance, the
exact proximal extent of the lesion could not
be determined and required percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography or fistulo￾graphy. Furthermore, in one patient with
complete transection of the right segmental
hepatic duct the retrograde cholangiogram
was falsely interpreted as normal. Subsequent
fistulography established the correct diag￾nosis.
Type and level of the bile duct injury
There were 18 minor bile duct leaks (type A
lesions), 11 major bile duct leaks (type B
lesions), nine bile duct strictures without con￾comitant bile leakage (type C lesions), and 15
patients with a complete transection of the
duct (type D lesions). Table IV shows the
localisation of the different types of bile duct
injuries. After diagnosis of the bile duct lesion,
initial treatment was performed at referring
centres in 13 patients and after referral to our
centre in 40 patients. Table V gives initial
treatment and complications before and after
referral.
Minor bile duct leaks (type A lesions)
Initial treatment (Table - all 18 patients
with a type A ductal injury were diagnosed and
treated endoscopically. Endoscopic treatment
consisted of endoscopic sphincterotomy (nine
patients) or insertion of a biliary endopros￾thesis (nine patients) with elective stent
removal after six weeks (Fig 1). Insertion of
biliary endoprostheses was essentially
attempted without sphincterotomy unless a
precut sphincterotomy proved necessary to
obtain access to the common bile duct or a
sphincterotomy was required for removal of
gall stones. Percutaneous or surgical drainage
of bile collections, or both, was performed in
nine patients (before ERCP in six, after
endoscopy in three).
Early complications -- complications of the
endoscopic treatment occurred in two
patients. One patient with a cystic duct leak
and distal obstruction caused by a stone in the
cystic duct remnant (Mirrizi's syndrome)
suffered from bleeding after precut sphinc￾terotomy and recovered after blood trans￾fusions. She underwent surgical resection of
the cystic duct remnant. An 89 year old
patient with a cystic duct leak died seven days
after ERCP. He presented 15 days after
surgery with multi organ failure and respira￾tory insufficiency that proved irreversible after
stent insertion.
Late complications and secondary treatment -
during a median follow up period of 14 months
(range 1-37) three late complications
occurred. One patient developed colicky
abdominal pain and underwent laparotomy for
removal of a second gall bladder. A second
patient developed a stricture of the common
hepatic duct, six months after laparoscopic
cholecystectomy and was successfully treated
endoscopically. Re-evaluation of previous
cholangiograms showed that this stenosis was
overlooked at the initial ERCP at which time a
short endoprosthesis was placed bypassing
only the biliary sphincter but not bridging the
stenosed part of the bile duct. Finally a third
patient with an injury to an aberrant bile duct
developed atrophy of hepatic segment 6-7 and
a distal bile duct stricture. She was treated
endoscopically. None of the remaining 14
patients developed any late complications or
showed abnormal liver function tests at follow
up to date.
Major bile duct leaks (type B lesions)
Initial treatment (Table I) - there were 11
patients with bile leakage from the common
bile duct or the main hepatic duct. Four

patients underwent suture repair over a T
tube at the site of the leakage (two patients
during cholecystectomy). ERCP and inser￾tion of biliary endoprostheses was attempted
in seven patients. Endoscopic treatment gen￾erally consisted of insertion of a endopros￾thesis at the first endoscopic procedure. After
six weeks the lesion was evaluated endoscopi￾cally. In the case of absence of leakage and no
signs of secondary ductal stenosis the endo￾prosthesis was removed. If a stricture of the
bile duct was present, however, the patient
entered the endoscopic treatment regimen for
benign ductal stenosis: two 10 Fr endopros￾theses were placed and left in situ for one year
with elective stent exchange every three
months to prevent cholangitis from clogging.
Stent insertion failed in two patients with a
large defect in the wall of the common hepatic
duct. The guidewire selectively passed
through the defect and could not be advanced

into the proximal biliary system. Further
treatment in these patients consisted of
hepaticojejunostomy (n= 1) and surgical T
tube insertion followed by endoscopic place￾ment of an endoprosthesis (n=l). Drainage
of bile collections was performed in five
patients, all before (n=l) or during initial
treatment (n=4).
Early complications - early complications
occurred in two patients: a 74 year old patient
died four days after stent insertion of a myo￾cardial infarction and a second patient with
bile leakage after removal of the T tube was
treated endoscopically with biliary endopros￾theses.
Late complications and secondary treatment -
during a median follow up of 17 months
(range 0-33) three patients (all initially
treated with suture repair and T tube inser￾tion), developed late ductal stenosis. In two a
hepaticojejunostomy was performed after
endoscopic treatment had failed, the third
patient was successfully treated with biliary
stenting for one year. All patients initially
treated with biliary endoprostheses are free of
symptoms with normal liver function parame￾ters, 4 to 32 months (median 20) after laparo￾scopic cholecystectomy (6 to 11 months after
stent removal). Two patients still have stents
in situ.
Bile duct strictures (type C lesions)
Initial treatment (Table I' - all nine patients
with ductal strictures had their diagnosis con￾firmed and insertion of endoprostheses
attempted at ERCP. In four patients insertion
of the endoprostheses failed because the stric￾ture could not be passed by a guidewire. Three
subsequently underwent surgery; hepatico￾jejunostomy (n=2), removal of hemoclip
(n= 1). The fourth patient had complete disap￾pearance of all symptoms before any further
treatment. She remains free of symptoms with
normal liver function tests, 18 months after the
stenosis was diagnosed. The most probable
explanation is that she has developed a biliary￾digestive fistula that bypasses the biliary stric￾ture. Insertion of a stent was successful in
the remaining five patients but one patient

developed an episode of fever after endoscopic
stent exchange that resolved with conservative
treatment. In one patient the stricture persisted
after one year stenting. He subsequently
underwent uncomplicated hepaticojejunos￾tomy. The patients who underwent successful
endoscopic treatment are free of symptoms
with normal liver function tests 10 and 19
months after removal of the stents. One patient
still has stents in situ.
Complete transection of the bile ducts (type D
lesions, Fig 2)
Initial treatment (Table V) - all 15 patients
with a type D bile duct injury eventually under￾went reconstructive surgery. The following
reconstructive surgical procedures were per￾formed: Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy at
the confluens or common hepatic duct
(n= 11), separate hepaticojejunostomies to
both the right and left main hepatic duct (n= 2)
or to the right hepatic duct only (n= 1), and
end to end anastomosis of the common hepatic
duct (n= 1). A Rodney Smith's mucosal graft
procedure was performed on one patient. Of
14 hepaticojejunostomies, two were performed
at the initial cholecystectomy, five were per￾formed in the early postoperative phase mainly
during diagnostic laparotomy, and seven were
performed electively after 8-12 weeks. In the
last group drainage of bile collections was
initially established percutaneously or surgi￾cally, or both, to stabilise the patient's con￾dition. At a second stage, in most cases 24
hours before the reconstruction, percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography and drainage
(PTCD) (Fig 2) was performed to investigate
the proximal extent of the lesion and drains
were inserted to guide the surgeon during the
reconstructive procedure.
Early complications - reconstructive surgery
was complicated by bile leakage in seven
patients (before referral in four patients (80%),
after referral in three (30%), Table V). Three
of these patients required surgery and cardio￾respiratory supportive measures, one patient
was treated with biliary endoprostheses, and
three patients were treated by external
drainage and antibiotics.
Late complications and secondary treatment -
median follow up in the 15 patients with a type
D injury was 25 months (range 6-38) and late
complications occurred in seven patients
(47%). Four patients had recurrent cholangitis
caused by stenosis of the biliodigestive anasto￾mosis and were treated with percutaneous
transhepatic balloon dilatation (n=3) or recon￾struction of the hepaticojejunostomy (n= 2), or
both. Two patients had signs of biliary obstruc￾tion that resolved spontaneously. Diagnostic
imaging in these patients showed no evidence
of stenosis and an expectant policy was fol￾lowed. Finally, one patient with episodes of
recurrent pancreatitis caused by sphincter
stenosis after previous precut sphincterotomy
was treated endoscopically. At follow up to
date all patients are free of symptoms but seven
patients (47%) have cholestatic liver function
parameters (>3 times the upper limit).

Early complications and late stenosis of the
anastomosis occurred more often in patients
who underwent reconstructive surgery in the
early postoperative phase: in the five patients
who underwent reconstructive surgery in the
early postoperative phase, four complications
were seen (80%) whereas in the seven patients
who underwent elective hepaticojejunostomy
only one complication occurred (14%),
(p=0.07 Fisher's exact test).
Secondary reconstructive surgery
Five patients (two type B lesions, one type C
lesion, and two type D lesions) underwent a
secondary hepaticojejunostomy because of
ductal (re)stenosis. All these secondary pro￾cedures were performed without early compli￾cations and no patient has developed any
further late complications during a median
follow up of nine months (range 1-22).
Discussion
This study shows that the diagnosis ofbile duct
injuries after laparoscopic cholecystectomy
is usually straightforward in patients with an
isolated ductal stricture (Table III), but may
be difficult in patients with bile leakage as
symptoms are frequently absent or aspecific in
the early postoperative phase. 14 Early diagnosis
in these patients is, however, important
because the clinical condition may rapidly
deteriorate after three to five days when ileus,
peritonitis, and sepsis develop. Several authors
have, therefore, emphasised the importance of
early aggressive investigation in patients with
diffuse abdominal pain, fever, malaise or
liver function abnormalities after laparoscopic
cholecystectomy.13 15 16 First step is to perform
an abdominal ultrasound to investigate the
presence of ductal dilatation or fluid collec￾tions.7 The last are often located in the lower
abdominal cavity.17 Biliary dilatation is often
absent (in our series in 71%) because the bil￾iary system is decompressed by the leak. In the
event of fluid collections, percutaneous needle
aspiration may differentiate an abscess from a
biloma.'8 When ductal dilatation is present or
needle aspiration yields bile, an ERCP is the
next diagnostic procedure. In our study, ERCP
established the diagnosis in all type A, B, and
C lesions and attributed to the diagnosis and
further treatment in patients with type D
lesions. However, the last group required per￾cutaneous cholangiography to delineate the
proximal extent of the injury. Early diagnostic
laparotomy without classification of the injury
and therapeutic plan should be avoided.
In our series endoscopic treatment proved
effective in 89% of the patients with leakage
from cystic ducts or peripheral hepatic radicles
(type A ductal injury) though 16% required
additional external drainage of biloma. These
results are comparable with those recently
published by Kozarek et al.1920 Others have
advocated the use of endoscopic sphinctero￾tomy for minor bile duct leaks.7 However,
endoscopic sphincterotomy is not without
risks21 and possible longterm sequelae of loss
of sphincter function are of concern in younger
patients.22 We, therefore, treat these patients
with biliary endoprostheses to bypass the leak
and, more importantly, to lower the pressure of
the biliary system by bypassing the biliary
sphincter (Fig 3). The stent is preferably
inserted without prior endoscopic sphinctero￾tomy unless this is necessary to extract bile
duct stones or gain biliary access. Although
insertion of an endoprosthesis gives the patient
the burden of a second endoscopic interven￾tion for removal of the stent, we feel that this is
outweighed by preventing a sphincterotomy.
Insertion of an endoprosthesis proved suc￾cessful in 71% of patients with leakage fromn
major bile ducts (type B lesions). This success
rate is comparable with the 76-79% success
rate reported by others.8 23 Three patients
treated with suture repair and T tube insertion
developed late stenosis (75%). Although this
probably reflects the referral bias this study
suffers from, it points towards an important
late complication of this type of lesion;
secondary stenosis at the site of the leak.
Woods et a18 described 27 patients with major
bile leaks or strictures, or both. Primary suture
repair was performed in 11 of 27 patients with
four of these 11 needing additional endoscopic
stenting for secondary strictures and another
four requiring biliodigestive bypass. Surgical
treatment with placement of a T tube is gener￾ally advocated for these patients if the injury is
detected during cholecystectomy.
Although this will successfully treat the bile
leakage, the duration of T tube placement may
be too short to effectively prevent secondary
stenosis. We, therefore, prefer to remove the
T drain after six weeks and treat patients in
whom the leak is detected postoperatively with
primary endoscopic stenting (Fig 3). Insertion
of an endoprosthesis not only adequately seals
the bile leakage but also allows for early
diagnosis and treatment of secondary ductal
stenosis. In case the endoscopic stent insertion
fails we first attempt to drain the bile duct with
PTCD, before resorting to surgical placement
of a T tube (Fig 3).
In contrast with the results of endoscopic
treatment in patients with a type A or type B
lesion, the results of endoscopic treatment of
isolated biliary strictures were disappointing.
Overall, successful treatment of strictures was
accomplished in three of eight patients (38%)
in whom endoscopic treatment was attempted
as definitive treatment (one patient with stents
in situ). However, most failures (80%) resulted
from inability to pass the stricture at the first
endoscopic session, which was performed
primarily as a diagnostic procedure and no
adverse effects were noted from attempts at
stent insertion. There are no randomised
studies available comparing endoscopic stent￾ing with surgical treatment for patients with
bile duct strictures after cholecystectomy. We
recently published a retrospective study in
which these two treatment regimens were
compared and concluded that surgery and
endoscopy were equally successful.24 Because
surgery is still available when endoscopy
fails whereas vice versa is impossible once a

Treatment of bile duct lesions after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 147
Roux-en-Y loop has been constructed, we
prefer to attempt endoscopic treatment first
(Fig 3).
All 15 patients with complete transection of
the bile duct eventually underwent reconstruc￾tive surgery. Early morbidity, late stenosis of
the anastomoses, and abnormal liver function
tests at follow up to date all attest to the sever￾ity of the injury and the difficulty of adequate
treatment. Most early and late complications
occurred in patients initially treated at refer￾ring centres (Table IV). The outcome of surgi￾cal treatment of these lesions is influenced by a
variety of factors including: proximal extent of
the injury, type of reconstructive procedure
performed, experience of the performing
surgeon, timing of intervention, presence of
proximal dilatation and local inflammation at
the time of the procedure, condition of the
patient, and the length of follow up. The num￾bers in this series are too small to perform a
multivariate analysis for evaluation of these
factors. An important factor determining the
outcome of reconstructive surgery is the timing
of the procedure. We observed that early com￾plications and late anastomotic stenoses
occurred in 80% of patients treated with early
reconstructive surgery whereas these complica￾tions were observed in 17% of patients who
underwent elective surgery after 8-12 weeks.
Reconstructive surgery in the acute postopera￾tive phase, often started as a diagnostic pro￾cedure in a patient with peritonitis, ileus or
sepsis, is at risk for leakage and stenosis
because of the absence of proximal dilatation
and the presence of severe inflammatory
changes of the tissue. Adequate drainage for
8-12 weeks allows for the acute local inflam￾matory reaction to subside and enables the
surgeon to establish the exact proximal extent
of the injury before surgery. In most patients
24 hours before the reconstruction, a PTCD is
performed to delineate the proximal anatomy
and to insert a biliary catheter. These percuta￾neous catheters may be very helpful at surgery
for identification of the injured duct and for
subsequent stenting of the anastomosis if
necessary.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has shown its
overall safety and efficacy. Although most
centres performing laparoscopic cholecystec￾tomy may now be well beyond the 'learning
curve' phase, the incidence of bile duct injuries
will probably stay increased compared with
conventional cholecystectomy. The incidence
and severity of the lesions warrant a systematic
approach conceming diagnosis and treatment.
Although differences in local expertise con￾cerning interventional radiology,25 therapeutic
endoscopy'2 and reconstructive surgery9
may lead to modifications of the proposed
algorithms, the principles outlined in this
article may be helpful for the clinician in the
treatment of bile duct lesions after laparo￾scopic cholecystectomy.
