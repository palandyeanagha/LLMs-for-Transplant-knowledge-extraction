Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary
embolism (PE), is becoming increasingly recognized as a cause of morbidity and
mortality in pediatrics, particularly among hospitalized children. Furthermore, evidence
is accumulating that suggests the inflammatory response may be a cause, as well
as consequence, of VTE, but current anticoagulation treatment regimens are not
designed to inhibit inflammation. In fact, many established clinical VTE risk factors
such as surgery, obesity, cystic fibrosis, sepsis, systemic infection, cancer, inflammatory
bowel disease, and lupus likely modulate thrombosis through inflammatory mediators.
Unlike other traumatic mechanisms of thrombosis involving vascular transection and
subsequent exposure of subendothelial collagen and other procoagulant extracellular
matrix materials, inflammation of the vessel wall may initiate thrombosis on an intact
vein. Activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes with subsequent formation
of microparticles can trigger the coagulation system through the induction of tissue factor
(TF). Identification of biomarkers to evaluate VTE risk could be of great use to the clinician
caring for a patient with inflammatory disease to guide decisions regarding the risk:benefit
ratio of various types of potential thromboprophylaxis strategies, or suggest a role for
anti-inflammatory therapy. Unfortunately, no such validated inflammatory scoring system
yet exists, though research in this area is ongoing. Elevation of C-reactive protein, IL-6,
IL-8, and TNF-alpha during a response to systemic inflammation have been associated
with increased VTE risk. Consequent platelet activation enhances the prothrombotic
state, leading to VTE development, particularly in patients with other risk factors, most
notably central venous catheters.

Evidence is accumulating that the factors influencing VTE formation are not restricted to the
coagulation system alone, but rather that the immune system is also closely involved with formation
and resolution of thrombosis. It is important to consider the contributions of inflammation to VTE
development in general, but also as it pertains to certain specific disease categories more commonly
associated with development of hospital-acquired VTE (HA-VTE) in some patients. Surgery, (1–
3) obesity, (4) cystic fibrosis, (5–7) sepsis, (8–10) systemic infection, (11, 12) cancer, (13–15)
inflammatory bowel disease, (16–18), and lupus (19–22) are clinical VTE risk factors that may
modulate thrombosis through inflammatory mediators. Understanding the role of inflammation
in these particular clinical situations may not only help determine the optimal management but
may also aid in the development of future preventative strategies, since current anticoagulation
treatment regimens are not designed to inhibit inflammation (23).

Branchford and Carpenter Inflammation and VTE
Recently, inflammation has been accepted as a common
pathway through which various risk factors trigger VTE
formation. A feasible mechanism is that inflammation of the
vessel wall initiates thrombus formation in an intact vein and that
inflammation and coagulation systems are coupled by a common
activation pathway. The first event in thrombus formation is
probably activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes,
with initiation of inflammation and formation of microparticles
that trigger the coagulation system through the induction of
TF. Therefore, the key event in the initiation of VTE formation
is most likely vein wall inflammation, but the contribution
of specific immune modulators has not yet been elucidated.
Recently, it was demonstrated that probable association between
VTE and several other markers of inflammation such as C￾reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor￾alpha exists (24–28). These pro-inflammatory cytokines play
an important role in VTE by promoting a pro-coagulant
state primarily by inducing the expression of tissue factor.
Several immune system components (cytokines, chemokines,
and various leukocyte subtypes) are involved in the underlying
inflammatory process of VTE, as is very well-described in a
recent review from Saghazadeh et al. (23). Additionally, it has
been recently described that inflammatory mediators such as
polyphosphates, bradykinin, and others may directly activate
the contact system (the polyphosphate—Factor XII association
is particularly notable) and initiate the extrinsic coagulation
pathway (29–31).
The identification and elucidation of inflammatory markers
relevant to VTE could provide targets for future therapy. That
inflammation is the basic etiopathogenic process of VTE is also
supported by the relation of some risk factors to both arterial
and venous thrombosis: age, increased BMI, atherosclerotic
disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, antiphospholipid
antibodies, and hyperhomocysteinemia (28).
INTERACTION BETWEEN COAGULATION
AND INFLAMMATION
For over a century, thrombosis formation has been attributed
to three main groups of factors including alterations in blood
flow, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulable state, collectively
known as Virchow’s Triad (32). A prime example is the
frequent association of central venous catheter (CVC) with
VTE. Blood flow is altered by the obstacle in the vein, creating
turbulent flow in some areas, while promoting stasis in others,
depending on local vascular architecture. Additionally, the
endothelium is damaged at the catheter insertion site, and
the body actively attempts to repair that site with primary
and secondary hemostatic efforts. Finally, there is a high
likelihood that the underlying disease process that necessitated
the need for the CVC in the first place (volume resuscitation
in trauma or distributive shock, chemotherapy administration
for active cancer, long-term antibiotics for severe infection, etc.)
increases the risk for thrombosis. There is also likely a reciprocal
relationship between CVC infections leading to increasing risk
for line thrombosis and infected clots within a line likely to
adversely affect its function. Over the last decade, a growing body
of evidence suggests a role for consideration of inflammation
as a major contributor to the pathophysiology of VTE, (33)
likely by enhancing the hypercoagulable state and increasing
endothelial damage. Activation of endothelial cells, platelets,
and leukocytes, with subsequent initiation of inflammation
and microparticle formation, triggers the coagulation system
through induction of TF, primarily that borne by microparticles,
which may contribute to the hypercoagulable state in the Triad
(28, 34, 35). Both formation and resolution of thrombosis have
been associated with a series of inflammatory cascades (36, 37).
Moderate to severe degrees of inflammation (inflammatory
infiltrates throughout the thrombi, mostly composed of
lymphocytes, with some mixing of other components including
plasma cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils) (38) were found in
approximately 15% of thrombus specimens from pulmonary
thromboendarterectomy (23) and immunity/inflammatory
genes constitute nearly 10% of those genes whose expressions
are substantially altered under the influence of VTE (38, 39). A
reciprocal relationship exists in which patients with VTE have
an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, and vice
versa, while proven cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity,
tobacco use, diabetes, stress, and diet increase the risk of both
atherothrombotic events and VTE, likely due to the common
pathophysiological mechanism of promoting cardiovascular
inflammation (40).
Evidence of specific pathophysiologic links between the
coagulation system and innate immunity continues to mount.
Polyphosphate (polyP) is present in human platelet dense
granules and is released upon platelet activation, assisting with
coagulation by increasing activation of factor V, decreasing tissue
factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) activity, and delaying clot lysis
by activating thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI)
(41–44). PolyP is also a potent pro-inflammatory signal when
released from mast cells during a hypersensitivity reaction, for
example (42).
Additionally, histones have been shown to be increased
in sepsis and other inflammatory conditions along with
nucleosomes (DNA + histones), and are toxic to the
endothelium. Activated protein C inactivates histones, protecting
the endothelium in the process (45). Extracellular DNA fibers
extruded from neutrophils (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps,
NETs) are produced in response to infection to allow neutrophils
to trap and destroy invading microorganisms. Fibrin formation
and deposition has been shown to be stimulated by NETs, and
fibrin formation is also important in trapping organisms and
controlling infection (46). NETs also cause platelet adhesion
and have been shown to be linked to deep vein thrombosis in
experimental models (47). Moreover, platelets have been shown
to stimulate NET production (46). There is also evidence that
some bacteria interact with platelets, either directly or through
antibody-mediated mechanisms, leading to platelet activation or
contributing to thrombus development. Other interactions have
been identified which are beyond the scope of this brief review
and have been described excellently elsewhere (45, 48–50).
Inflammation can be both a cause and a consequence of
VTE, but current anti-coagulation treatment regimens are not

specifically designed to inhibit inflammation (though it is known
that heparins have some anti-inflammatory effects). Selective
pharmacologic targeting of immune/inflammatory mediators in
VTE may result in more effective therapeutic or prophylactic
strategies (23). It is important to note, however, that the role
of anti-inflammatory therapies in VTE prevention efforts is
still not well-established. One study demonstrated a 2-fold or
more increased risk of VTE with the use of non-selective non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase￾2-selective (COX-2) inhibitors (51). These results were reflected
in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis in which
the pooled risk ratio among NSAID users was 1.8-fold for
VTE (52). Adequate VTE mechanism data in this setting are
not yet available, however, to determine whether the anti￾inflammatory medication itself drives the VTE formation or
whether inflammation drives the usage in patients who are being
treated with anti-inflammatory drugs to manage their underlying
medical condition. The same question may be considered in
users of steroids, though it has been shown more specifically
that glucocorticoids increase levels of clotting factors and
fibrinogen, which may explain the elevated VTE risk (especially
pulmonary embolism) demonstrated in a recent Danish study
of glucocorticoid users that followed an associated temporal
pattern, persisted after adjustment for underlying disease
severity, and existed even in non-inflammatory conditions (53).
A similar effect with 1.5-fold increased VTE risk was seen in
subjects treated with glucocorticoids for at least 30 days prior to
surgery (54).
Particular disease subgroup-specific relationships have been
studied, as seen below and in Table 1.
SURGERY AND TRAUMA
Surgery and trauma are linked in terms of HA-VTE risk
due to the tissue injury they have in common. The role of
inflammation in driving HA-VTE risk in these clinical situations
is primarily related to the process through which transected
vessels and tissue undergo physiologic repair. The innate
immune system is activated following tissue injury, platelets
degranulate locally after recruitment from the circulation, and
tissue macrophages and mast cells are activated with a combined
effect of leukocyte chemoattraction (55). Neutrophils infiltrate
the wound, followed by additional circulating monocytes that
differentiate into mature tissue macrophages, (56) and later by
additional infiltration of mast cells from adjacent tissue (57),
and finally by T-lymphocytes (58). The collective result of these
cellular activation processes is increased release of IL-1, IL￾6, IL-12, and TNFα (59, 60). IL-6 has been demonstrated to
play a critical role in inflammation-related thrombosis (61)
increased concentrations of IL-6, along with TNFα and IL-8
are potent risk predictors for VTE, even after adjustment for
covariates, including CRP (62). Additional neutrophil presence
(following chemoattractant release from platelets and mast cells)
and subsequent NET formation have been linked to venous
thrombosis (47, 63). The interaction between endothelial E￾selectin, leukocyte L-selectin, and platelet P-selectin also plays an
important role in platelet-leukocyte aggregation and adherence
to vessel walls at sites of surgical or traumatic injury. P-selectin
inhibition has been shown to decrease venous thrombosis
in murine (64) thrombosis models and enhance thrombus
resolution in rat models (65). Similarly, E-selectin inhibition
with a small molecule inhibitor has been shown to decrease
inflammation (vein wall monocyte extravasation) and acute
venous thrombosis in a surgical model of murine thrombosis
induction (66) and is now being studied in early clinical trials in
humans.
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Among VTE-related hospitalizations, the presence of IBD
was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of mortality in
one population-based study (18). No studies have specifically
evaluated the potential benefit of VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized
or ambulatory IBD patients, but studies to date do not
support an increased bleeding risk with moderate doses of
anticoagulant medications in IBD patients with active disease
(18). Recent large studies have quantified this risk showing that
IBD patients run a 1.5 to 3.6 higher risk of developing VTE
than healthy controls (16, 17). IBD has been demonstrated
to represent an independent risk factor for the recurrence of
VTE (17).
IBD has been previously associated with increased levels
of TNFα (67) with upregulation of TNFα mRNA in colonic
tissue in patients with Crohn’s Disease (68) and Ulcerative
Colitis (69) and many current therapeutic regimens involve a
focus on blocking signaling through this molecule. Giannotta
et al. (16) have recently reviewed the specific effects of
TNFα on activation of intrinsic coagulation pathway by
inducing tissue factor expression on leukocyte surfaces, down￾regulation of natural anticoagulants (protein C and heparin￾antithrombin pathways) in addition to thrombomodulin and the
endothelial protein C receptor, increasing platelet production
and enhancing thrombin formation in conjunction with IL-6,
and triggering (in conjunction with IBD-associated elevation
in homocysteine) expression of vascular cell adhesion protein￾1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 on endothelial
surfaces leading to enhanced capacity to recruit T cells and
monocytes.
OBESITY
Obesity is a known risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis.
Studies have shown that obesity conveys an odds ratio of 1.7–2.2
for VTE, similar to that of other known VTE risk factors (70).
A recent cohort of 268 adults with incident VTE events over 4.6
years from the Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences
(REGARDS) cohort demonstrated that higher CRP levels and
lower serum albumin levels were associated with increased VTE
risk and statistically mediated part of the association of body
mass index (BMI) with VTE, suggesting that inflammation may
be a potential mechanism underlying the relationship between
obesity and VTE risk. White blood cell (WBC) count and platelet

TABLE 1 | Inflammatory considerations in specific clinical situations.
Clinical subgroup Inflammatory considerations
Surgery The healing process is, at baseline, inflammatory since this is the mechanism by which tissues are re-approximated and
cellular debris is cleared. Surgery may also be in response to an inflammatory stimulus (e.g., cancer, abscess, trauma). SCD
usage may be helpful in surgeries extending over a certain time duration because of their mechanism of replacing the
venous return assistance usually provided by the body’s lower extremity muscle contractions while walking.
Inflammatory bowel disease Various reports of odds ratio between 1.5 and 3.5 for increased VTE risk in patients with IBD. Primary risk factors in this
subgroup include disease severity, colonic localization, and recent surgery. Risk decreases with treatment of underlying
condition.
Obesity Obesity confers an odds ratio between 1.7 and 2.2 for VTE, likely acting through higher CRP levels found in subjects with
higher BMI, in addition to potential for decreased physical activity.
Cystic fibrosis Multifactorial increased VTE risk: frequent hospitalizations, systemic or severe local infections (especially with specifically
thrombogenic strains such as B. cepacia), elevated acute phase reactants, CVC presence, activated platelets. Risk
decreases with appropriate management of underlying condition.
Sepsis/systemic infection Specific risk from acute phase reactant release (tissue factor, VWF, procoagulant microparticles), inhibition of fibrinolysis,
NET formation, etc. Risk is increased in both systemic and severe local infections.
Systemic lupus erythematosus Particularly challenging due to existence of both chronic and acute inflammatory-driven risk states and auto-immune
component (APLA, innate immune dysregulation, etc.). Risk decreases with treatment of underlying condition.
count were not determined to have any relationship. Adipocytes
secrete inflammatory cytokines leading to chronic, low-grade
inflammation resulting from recruitment of macrophages to
adipose tissues that progressively accumulate as fat mass
increases, and drive a progression of anti-inflammatory M2
macrophages to proinflammatory M1 macrophages, leading
to increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including
TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, as well as impaired fibrinolysis due to
marked increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression
(70). These proinflammatory cytokines, as well as adipokines
such as leptin, stimulate vascular endothelium, platelets,
and other circulating vascular cells, leading to upregulation
of procoagulant factors including tissue factor and cellular
adhesion molecules, downregulation of anticoagulant regulatory
proteins, increased thrombin generation, and enhanced platelet
activation (71). Finally, aberrant microRNA expression patterns
likely contribute to thrombosis in obesity through decreased
endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability, unregulated expression
of endothelial adhesion molecules, and enhanced platelet
activation and degranulation as reviewed by Blokhin and
Lentz (72).
CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF)
CF is a multi-system inflammatory disease, complicated
by excessive production of thick mucus secretions that
lead to pulmonary infectious exacerbations resulting in
hospitalization for IV antibiotics, frequently through a CVC.
These patients have increased risk of thrombosis due to CVCs,
as well as acquired thrombophilia secondary to inflammation
[including both the elevation of pro-coagulant acute phase
reactant proteins such as fibrinogen, factor VIII, and/or
von Willebrand factor (VWF), as well as the suppression of
protein S by inflammation-related C4B binding protein], or
natural anticoagulant protein deficiencies due to vitamin K
deficiency and/or liver dysfunction (6). Also, the incidence
of antiphospholipid antibodies that may be associated with
increased thrombotic risk ranges from about 5–10% in patients
with CF, which is elevated compared to that reported in
healthy children (1–3%) (73, 74). While platelets are generally
thought to play a more significant role in the pathogenesis
of arterial thrombosis (coronary heart disease and stroke), it
has been postulated that activated platelets may contribute
to pulmonary inflammation and tissue destruction in CF,
specifically (75). Certain specific pulmonary infections, such
as Burkholderia cepacia, may also increase VTE risk in CF
patients (76).
VTE in children with cystic fibrosis was recently studied at
a single center and the incidence rate was found to be 53 VTE
cases per 10,000 children with CF. Several inflammatory￾specific risk factors for VTE were reported, including
sinus disease, positive respiratory cultures, and elevated
inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation
rate and CRP (7). A recent retrospective study of 116
adults with CF hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbations
using a CVC demonstrated a 2.5% incidence of catheter￾related VTE (77). Elevated CRP was associated with the
thrombosis group but did not reach statistical significance
(p = 0.51) and the time to VTE development was shorter
for peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) lines
compared to Port-a-Cath, though the only two recurrent
events occurred in subjects with Port-a-Caths (77). A
prospective study of 90 adult and pediatric CF patients,
on the other hand, demonstrated a CVC-related VTE
frequency of 6.6% (combination of symptomatic clots and
those detected by screening ultrasound) (5). This study
did not identify biomarkers (CRP, D-dimer, fibrinogen) for
inflammatory/hypercoagulable screening at the time of catheter
insertion, but did emphasize the contribution of VTE history
and raises the issue of prospective Doppler ultrasound for
consideration in identifying asymptomatic CVC-VTEs, though
the role of anticoagulant therapy in the management of these
patients remains controversial. The utility of pharmacologic

prophylaxis for the prevention of CVC-associated thrombosis,
particularly in high risk CF individuals, deserves further
study (6).
SEPSIS AND SYSTEMIC INFECTION
Bacterial sepsis is a classic example of inflammation-triggered
coagulation induced by endothelial injury and tissue factor
expression following an acute systemic inflammatory
response, (78) leading to activation and consumption of
coagulation factors and platelets, along with impaired
fibrinolysis, disruption of endothelial barrier, and loss of
physiologic antithrombotic factors such as thrombomodulin
(79). Sepsis denotes progressively more severe host defense
reactions to invading organisms with endothelial dysfunction
and elevation of inflammatory markers triggering the
activation of coagulation with concurrent down-regulation
of anticoagulant systems and fibrinolysis (disseminated
intravascular coagulation, DIC) which, in turn, contributes
to increased inflammation. There is significant interplay
between inflammation and coagulation in sepsis, highlighted
by the procoagulant properties of the endothelium such as
expression of tissue factor (TF) and VWF, activating interactions
with platelets, release of procoagulant microparticles, and
downregulation of TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and the
protein C/S anticoagulant system, inhibiting fibrinolysis.
The coagulation response serves to isolate the invasive
organism, but some bacteria have adapted to this and can
use the coagulation response to hide from immune attack
(12, 46, 80).
As mentioned above regarding B. cepacia specifically
imparting elevated VTE risk in CF patients, certain clinical
variables and bacterial virulence factors are associated with
VTE in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (Methicillin￾resistance, CRP >20 mg/dL, and hemoglobin nadir </=
9 g/dL, though it may not always be clear whether anemia
was an additional factor in the development of thrombus
or is a marker of more severe disease) (11). These findings
were comparable to those from another study of 70
children with osteomyelitis where in an elevated CRP was
associated with increased VTE risk (81). Furthermore, a
study of over 10,000 subjects in the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) study, CRP above the 90th percentile
was associated with a 76% increase in risk of VTE versus
lower percentiles (24). A recent study of 39,831 patients who
underwent colorectal surgery demonstrated a 2.4% incidence
of VTE, associated with urinary tract infections, pneumonia,
organ space surgical site infection, or deep surgical site
infection (3).
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS
In general, inflammatory rheumatologic diseases (lupus,
Sjogren’s syndrome, inflammatory myositis, and systemic
sclerosis) are associated with high VTE rates—more than
three times higher than in the general population (22). In
particular, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are
at significantly increased risk for premature atherosclerosis and
thrombosis not only due to direct effects of chronic systemic
inflammation but also to the additional risk imparted by
antiphospholipid antibodies (21). This acquired, multi-organ,
autoimmune disease itself is an independent risk factor for
both arterial and venous thrombotic events, particularly in
those with the antiphospholipid syndrome. Myriad factors
influence atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in SLE
patients, including those related to the disease itself (INF-alpha,
TNF-alpha, MCP-1, cystatin C, kidney disease, overexpression
of ICAM/VCAM/VEGF/VWF, NETs, elevations of interleukins
6/12/17/18, and other acute phase reactants) and to the
medications used to treat it (corticosteroids, antimalarials,
mycophenolate mofetil, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) (20). Individuals with
SLE have been shown to have decreased DNase1 activity in
their serum, which decreases NET degradation, and may
contribute to thrombus formation (47). Activation of the innate
immune system as evidenced by the elevation of TNF-alpha
and the interleukins described above increases the risk of
VTE even after adjustment for CRP (62). Polymorphisms in
genes encoding factor VIII, Interleukin-1β, and interleukin￾10 have been shown to modulate the risk of idiopathic
VTE (82).
The lupus nephritis and autoimmune thrombocytopenia
found in some of these patients also complicate the
anticoagulant strategies and their standardization, but consistent
APLA screening, renal evaluation/management, and use of
hydroxycholorquine may decrease thrombotic risk or at least
disease-related morbidity/mortality (19).
CONCLUSION
Clinical observations and mounting laboratory evidence support
a complex interplay between inflammation, innate immunity,
and the coagulation system. As more is understood about
these interactions, novel preventive and treatment modalities for
thrombosis will likely become available.
