Abstract
Background: Major surgical procedures facilitate systemic endotoxinemia and formation of free
radicals with subsequent inflammatory changes that can influence the postoperative course.
Experimental data suggest that preoperative supraphysiological doses of melatonin, a potent
immuno-modulator and antioxidant, would decrease postoperative infectious and non-infectious
complications induced by major abdominal surgery.
Methods/Design: A randomized controlled double blind single center clinical trial with two study
arms comprising a total of 40 patients has been designed to assess the effects of a single
preoperative dose of melatonin before major liver resection. Primary endpoints include the
determination of safety and tolerance of the regimen as well as clinical parameters reflecting
pathophysiological functions of the liver. Furthermore, data on clinical outcome (infectious and
non-infectious complications) will be collected as secondary endpoints to allow a power calculation
for a randomized clinical trial aiming at clinical efficacy.
Discussion: Based on experimental data, this ongoing clinical trial represents an advanced element
of the research chain from bench to bedside in order to reach the highest level of evidence-based
clinical facts to determine if melatonin can improve the general outcome after liver resection.

cure [1]." However, the consequences of this sophisticated
sequence of events are not always advantageous for the
surgical patient due to the varying magnitude of the
response and the severity of the injury. Tissue ischemia
and the subsequent reperfusion, particularly in visceral
organs, as well as loss of intra- and extravascular volume
due to hemorrhage, burn injury or extracorporeal circula￾tion can result in oxidative stress, in both surgical and dis￾tant sites, microvascular leakage, platelet aggregation,
leukocyte-endothelium adhesion, and depression of
humoral and cell-mediated immunity that subsequently
lead to proinflammatory changes [2]. Systemic endotox￾inemia is accentuated due to the leakage of aerobic and
anaerobic microflora from the gastrointestinal tract
through microvascular damage resulting from ischemia/
reperfusion injury, altered immunity secondary to the
inflammatory cascade, visceral ischemia and necrosis,
hemorrhage and hypotension [3]. Under these circum￾stances the occurrence of transient endotoxinemia and
formation of free radicals is almost certain with both
infectious and non-infectious postoperative complica￾tions as possible consequences. Surgical infections, iden￾tified as a major limiting factor to the postoperative
clinical recovery, do occur in spite of preventive treatment
with antibiotics immediately before or during surgical
treatment and represent a major challenge especially
when more complex and high-risk operations are per￾formed in more debilitated patients, and in the face of
increasing antibiotic resistance.
Melatonin
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormo￾nal product primarily produced and secreted by the pineal
gland, although it has been detected in other tissues as
well [4]. Melatonin is involved in the circadian rhythm
and the sleep-wake cycle of vertebrates. In addition to its
main function of sleep induction, melatonin is also
known for its immunomodulating activities as well as for
its antioxidative effects [5-7]. Melatonin is the most pow￾erful endogenous free radical scavenger known at present.
It not only directly neutralizes a number of free radicals
and reactive oxygen species, but also stimulates several
antioxidative enzymes which increase its efficiency as
antioxidant.
In terms of direct free radical scavenging, melatonin inter￾acts with the highly toxic hydroxyl radical with a rate con￾stant to that of other highly efficient hydroxyl radical
scavengers. Additionally, melatonin reportedly neutral￾izes hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite
anion, nitric oxide and hypochlorous acid and stimulates
antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, glu￾tathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Melatonin
can be widely used as a protective agent against a wide
variety of processes and agents that damage tissues via free
radical and reactive oxygen mechanisms. The highest con￾centration of melatonin has been found in the hepatobil￾iary system [8] with high-affinity binding sites in
hepatocyte nuclei [9].
Pharmacokinetics
The antioxidative effects of melatonin require concentra￾tions that are much higher than endogenously produced
plasma concentrations (peak plasma levels of approxi￾mately 100 pg/ml) [10]. Exogenous oral doses of mela￾tonin >0.3 mg produce already supraphysiological levels
in humans [11]. Orally administered melatonin is subject
to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, and abso￾lute bioavailability is reported to be approximately 15%,
although highly variable [12,13]. Melatonin has an elim￾ination half-life (t1/2) of 30–45 min [14-17] which is
extended to approximately 100 min in cirrhotic patients
[15]. In humans, the principal metabolite of endogenous
as well as exogenous melatonin is 6-sulphatoxy mela￾tonin [18].
Toxicity of melatonin is remarkably low. It was not possi￾ble to determine DL50 for melatonin since the highest
possible does (800 mg/kg BW; limitation imposed by the
solubility of the compound) failed to induce mortality in
mice [19]. When melatonin was given to rats on gestation
days 6–19 in very large doses (50–200 mg/kg BW, the
doses equal to ~17.5 – 70 g/day) the maternal toxicity
NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Load) and LOAEL
(Lowest observed adverse effect level) were 100 and 200
mg/kg/day, respectively, and the developmental toxicity
NOAEL was >200 mg/kg BW [20]. No significant adverse
effects were observed following administration of high
doses (3 – 6.6 g/day) to eleven individuals for 15 to 35
days [21].
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has designated melatonin as an orphan product
sold as a dietetic complement with the only therapeutic
indication in circadian rhythm disturbances in blind
patients [22]. In most European countries this hormone is
considered as a scientifically non-evaluated drug, there￾fore its sale is not allowed [4].
Trial rationale
Experimental data suggest that melatonin applied preop￾eratively would be suitable for prevention or prophylactic
treatment of postoperative infectious and non-infectious
complications induced by major surgical interventions.
Exogenous, intragastrically applied melatonin as well as
endogenously generated melatonin has been shown to
promote healing of gastric ulcers in rats [23]. This antiul￾cer activity has been attributed to the ability of melatonin
to stimulate enzymes that protect against oxidative stress
[24,25]. Besides, orally-administered melatonin has been

found efficient in reducing negative parameters of
cholestasis and provided a hepatoprotective effect against
the liver injury secondary to acute ligation of the biliary
duct in rats [26,27]. Most recently we observed that rats
gavaged with melatonin 2 h before warm ischemia/partial
liver resection survive significantly longer than appropri￾ate controls (unpublished data). Enzymes (transami￾nases) indicative for liver damage were also significantly
reduced after preoperative melatonin following warm
ischemia in both rats and pigs in a dose dependent man￾ner (unpublished data). In clinical setting, melatonin has
been shown to enhance neutrophil apoptosis after partial
hepatectomy causing liver ischemia and reperfusion [28],
thus eliminating the consequent active inflammatory
response due to surgical injury [29]. Most recently, data
from a randomized clinical trial has shown intravenous
melatonin to decrease oxidative stress status and proin￾flammatory cytokines in human neonates undergoing
surgery for congenital malformations [30]. However, the
best administration route, the duration of treatment, the
effective dose of melatonin, its exact role in the patho￾physiology of surgical diseases, its pharmacological inter￾actions and untoward side effects, as well as its long-term
safety has not been fully established yet. Thus, this study
has been designed to meet the need for a larger rand￾omized controlled trial to confirm the suggested benefits
of melatonin with the consideration of the current knowl￾edge of its immunomodulatory effects.
Methods/Design
After the positive vote of the ethics committee of the Fac￾ulty of Medicine, Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg,
Germany, enrollment of the study subjects has been
started in June 2007 in this randomized controlled dou￾ble blind single center clinical trial as a pilot study on the
safety and tolerance of preoperative melatonin applica￾tion in patients undergoing major liver resection. Patients
are considered for recruitment to the study according to
inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1). The duration of
the trial for each subject is expected to be 9 days, i.e. 1 day
before operation (day -1), the day of operation (day 0)
and the first 7 days following the operative procedure
(postoperative days 1–7). Considering a recruitment rate
up to 5 cases per month, the overall duration of the trial is
expected to last approximately 8–10 months. A drop-out
rate of 10% (due to non-compliance, intolerance, prema￾ture discontinuation, lost to follow-up, etc) will increase
the total duration of trial to about 12 months. The actual
overall duration of recruitment may vary due to the avail￾ability and consent rate of patients undergoing major liver
resection.
Before operation demographic data, medical history,
physical examination, diagnosis, therapy, as well as
comorbidities and concomitant medications are docu￾mented on day -1. Furthermore, routine laboratory meas￾urements and substrate monitoring are carried out and
documented (Table 2). On the day of surgery and follow￾ing intubation for general anaesthesia, 500 ml milk con￾taining test (melatonin; Helsinn Chemicals, Biasca,
Switzerland) or placebo product (microcrystalline cellu￾lose) (50 mg/kg BW) is administered via a standard gastric
tube placed right after intubation of the patient. Clinical
laboratory values (including chemistry, hematology, liver
laboratory tests, and cytokines) and the substrates are
measured on the day of operation and daily throughout
the entire postoperative study period of 6 days. Clinical
outcome parameters include infectious (pneumonia,
wound infection, peritonitis, urinary tract infection, sep￾sis) as well as non-infectious (bilioma, bile fistula, pleural
effusion, bleeding, circulatory insufficiency, renal insuffi￾ciency, wound dehiscence, intestinal obstruction/ileus,
pulmonary embolism) complications. Sepsis is defined as
the presence of at least 2 out of the following 4 criteria: (1)
Table 1: Criteria of inclusion and exclusion of patients.

temperature >38°C or <36°C, (2) tachycardia >90/min,
(3) respiratory insufficiency (1 out of 3 criteria: respira￾tory rate >20/min, hyperventilation with PaCO2 <32
mmHg or PaO2 <70 mmHg (spontaneous breathing) or
PaO2/FiO2 <175 mmHg (mechanical ventilation), and
(4) leukocytosis >12/nl or leukopenia <4/nl. Renal failure
is defined according to RIFLE-criteria [31]. The schedule
for all study related activities and data collection is listed
in Table 2.
Objectives and endpoints
The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate safety
and tolerance of preoperative application of melatonin in
patients undergoing operative procedures for partial liver
resection. In addition, clinical parameters reflecting
pathophysiological functions of the liver will be deter￾mined.
Data on clinical outcome (infectious and non-infectious
complications) are collected as secondary endpoints to
allow a power calculation for a randomized clinical trial
aiming at clinical efficacy (Table 2).
Randomization and blinding
Randomization (1:1) will be performed by the algorithm
programmed in specific computer software and a rand￾omization list will be prepared. Briefly, "blocked ran￾domisation" will be performed using blocks of four that
will include equal packages of test product and control
product with the order of treatments within a block being
randomly permuted, thus ensuring treatment group num￾bers are evenly balanced at the end of each block. The ran￾dom number sequence is chosen to start from 1001 and
sets an ascending allocation order for the first four sub￾jects. Similarly, treatment type is allocated to the next four
patients in the order specified by the next randomly
selected permutation. The process is then repeated. The
randomization list will be prepared by the institution that
is responsible for the packaging of the study products (test
product, placebo), i.e. the Pharmacy of the University
clinic of Heidelberg, and kept in safe and confidential cus￾tody at this institution.
Patients satisfying the enrolment criteria will receive an
ascending serial number in the order of their enrolment.

Patient numbers for patients who replace drop-outs will
be assigned similarly.
Both study products, test (melatonin) and placebo prod￾uct (microcrystalline cellulose), will be of same form and
appearance (white powder in sachets) including the pack￾aging material.
In addition to the trial medication, the clinical trial direc￾tor (PS) will receive a set of sealed envelopes, one for each
randomization number. An identical set of sealed enve￾lopes will be held at the Pharmacy of the University clinic
of Heidelberg. These envelopes contain information on
the subject's trial medication and are to be opened only
under circumstances in which it is medically imperative to
know what the subject is receiving.
Adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical
occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical
product whether or not related to the investigational
product including: new symptoms/medical conditions,
new diagnosis, changes of laboratory parameters, inter￾current diseases and accidents, recurrence or worsening of
pre-existing co-morbidities, increase of frequency or
intensity of episodic diseases. A serious adverse event
(SAE) is a life-threatening event resulting in death or sig￾nificant persistent disability requiring subject hospitaliza￾tion or prolongation of existing hospitalization. All AEs
that occur after the subject has signed the informed con￾sent document to participate in this evaluation of safety
and tolerance of preoperative melatonin will be docu￾mented on the appropriate pages provided in the elec￾tronic Case Report Forms (eCRF). AEs must also be
documented in the subject's medical records and must be
monitored to determine outcome. The clinical course of
the AE will be followed up until its resolution or normal￾ization of changed laboratory parameters or until it has
changed to a stable condition. SAEs must be reported
using the "Serious Adverse Event" form provided in the
eCRF. The initial report must be as complete as possible
including details of the event and an assessment of the
causal relationship between the event and the trial medi￾cation. The clinical trial director must also inform site
monitor and data management in all cases.
Quality assurance
The procedures set out in this trial protocol, pertaining to
the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of this trial,
are designed to ensure that all persons involved in the trial
abide by Good Clinical Practice [32] and the ethical prin￾ciples described in the current revision of the Declaration
of Helsinki [33]. The trial will be carried out in keeping
with local legal and regulatory requirements.
Statistics and data management
All analyses will be carried out on an "intent-to-treat"
basis. However, attempts will be made to analyze "per
protocol" and "intent-to-treat" populations separately,
when statistically appropriate. For the purpose of "per
protocol" analysis, two groups of 20 eligible patients com￾pleting the protocol will be considered. Drop-out patients
are not to be replaced.
The target variables of this trial include laboratory values,
outcome parameters and adverse events. The target varia￾bles are measured from study day -1 to study day 7. The
differences of the laboratory values between study day -1
and 7 are tested with the paired t-test or, in case of uneven
distribution, the Wilcoxon-test (2-sided) for within group
comparison. The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to
detect differences between treatment groups. The follow￾ing statistical values will be calculated when appropriate:
mean, standard deviation, 95%-confidence interval of the
mean, minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile,
maximum, valid number, frequency count, and percent￾age. The laboratory values will be counted according to
their normal ranges (below normal, normal, and above
normal). SAS software (Version 8.2) will be used for anal￾ysis.
All patient data (clinical and resource use) generated dur￾ing the study will be recorded on the eCRFs provided by
HealthEcon AG, Basel, Switzerland. These forms are spe￾cifically designed in Microsoft Office Access (Version:
1.01) to meet the data recording requirements of the clin￾ical study protocol. Corrections of wrong entries will be
recorded automatically. In addition, for any correction of
data concerning "Adverse Events" or the primary target
variable the reason for the correction must be entered. All
data will be entered into a central database as recorded.
All data management activities will be done according to
the current Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of
HealthEcon AG.
Discussion
This clinical trial particularly demonstrates how a scien￾tific hypothesis has been developed from bench to bed￾side, with classical chain of investigations from early
experimental research to the highest level of evidence, a
randomized controlled double blind clinical trial. If pre￾vious experimental findings are confirmed by the data of
this clinical trial, melatonin would improve the overall
outcome after major liver resection.
