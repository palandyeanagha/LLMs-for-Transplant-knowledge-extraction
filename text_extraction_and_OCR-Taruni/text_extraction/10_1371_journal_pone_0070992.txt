Abstract
Innate immune responses are reasoned to play an important role during both acute and chronic SIV infection and play a
deterministic role during the acute stages on the rate of infection and disease progression. NK cells are an integral part of
the innate immune system but their role in influencing the course of SIV infection has been a subject of debate. As a means
to delineate the effect of NK cells on SIV infection, use was made of a Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibitor that has previously
been shown to be effective in the depletion of NK cells in vivo in nonhuman primates (NHP). Extensive safety and in vitro/in
vivo PK studies were conducted and an optimal dose that depletes NK cells and NK cell function in vivo identified. Six
chronically SIV infected rhesus macaques, 3 with undetectable/low plasma viral loads and 3 with high plasma viral loads
were administered a daily oral dose of 10 mg/kg for 35 days. Data obtained showed that, at the dose tested, the major cell
lineage affected both in the blood and the GI tissues were the NK cells. Such depletion appeared to be associated with a
transient increase in plasma and GI tissue viral loads. Whereas the number of NK cells returned to baseline values in the
blood, the GI tissues remained depleted of NK cells for a prolonged period of time. Recent findings show that the JAK3
inhibitor utilized in the studies reported herein has a broader activity than previously reported with dose dependent effects
on both JAK2 and JAK1 suggests that it is likely that multiple pathways are affected with the administration of this drug that
needs to be taken into account. The findings reported herein are the first studies on the use of a JAK3 inhibitor in lentivirus
infected NHP.

Introduction
The fact that the net outcome of host-virus interactions during
‘‘acute’’ infection of both human HIV-1 infection and SIV
infection of nonhuman primates dictates the rate of disease
progression suggests that properties unique to the incoming virus
and the quality and/or quantity of host ‘‘innate’’ immune effector
mechanisms must play a deterministic role [1]. This view has led
to the concept that it is during this time period post HIV/SIV
infection that the die is already cast with regards to the rate of
disease progression [2,3]. While results of a recent study indicate
properties such as replicative potential unique to the incoming
virus [4] and/or differences in the anatomical tissue sites targeted
by the virus [5] that appear to contribute to the rate of disease
progression, results from a number of studies including our
laboratory present an added and different perspective. Thus,
studies utilizing single pools of stock SIV to infect groups of rhesus
macaques showed a wide range of plasma and cellular viral loads
at set point and diverse clinical outcome ranging from Elite
Controllers to Fast Progressors [6–9]. These latter results suggest
that while properties unique to the virus are important, the host
innate and early adaptive immune effector mechanisms must play
a dominant role during this acute infection period. However, the
precise cell lineages that play this important role and the
mechanisms by which innate and/or early adaptive immune
effector cells mediate this important effect remains elusive.
One of the major cell lineage that comprise the innate immune
effector mechanisms is the natural killer (NK) cells whose function
in immune surveillance and mediating anti-viral effects have been
recently reviewed [10,11]. A large number of studies have
characterized the development and differentiation of NK cells
and its regulation [12–20] and documented both the phenotypic
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70992

and functional heterogeneity that exists within the NK cell lineage
[21–24]. Indeed, besides the classical non-MHC restricted
cytolytic activity ascribed to NK cells, it is now being appreciated
that there are subsets within this lineage that are non-cytolytic but
can function to synthesize a variety of cytokines/chemokines
[25,26], serve to regulate immune function termed NKregs [27–
32], serve as rheostats in controlling immune function [33] and
most surprisingly acquire and maintain immunological memory
[19,34–36], although the mechanisms by which such ‘‘immuno￾logical memory’’ is manifested has been a subject of debate [37].
This finding of ‘‘immunological memory’’ along with the finding
that NK cells have to undergo licensing and self MHC education
[38–40], possess a degree of target antigen specificity [41] and
display characteristics similar to T cells at the immunological
synapse [42] continues to blur the previous demarcation between
innate and adaptive immune function. These findings, thus, serve
to make us re-assess our general view of NK cells as lacking
specificity and as being evolutionary primitive and T cells having a
high degree of antigen/MHC specificity and being more
sophisticated [43,44]. It is also important to recognize the fact
that there are phenotypically and functionally distinct NK cells
that are resident in specific organs and tissues such as the oral
mucosa, gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and the liver [22,24,41,45,46]
that may be induced in these localized tissues to perform regular
NK cell function in addition to unique functions such as tissue
regeneration [47,48] distinct from those conventionally ascribe to
NK cells.
One of the most effective means to define the in vivo biological
function of a given cell lineage is to devise methods for the selective
and effective depletion of the cell lineage which for obvious ethical
reasons can only be performed in experimental animals. Among
the methods that have been employed so far for the depletion of
NK cells include the administration of in vivo cell depleting
lineage specific monoclonal/polyclonal antibodies, antibodies that
neutralize growth factors/cytokines critically required for the
growth or survival of the cell lineage and/or small molecule
inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways utilized primarily by
this cell lineage [49–51]. In addition, the study of humans with a
genetically inherited disease that results in NK cell depletion
[52,53], use of a transgenic murine strain deficient in NK cells
[54], and the study of murine strains that show decline in NK cell
function with age [55] exemplify the various lines of studies aimed
at defining the in vivo role of NK cells. In the case of the use of
antibodies to deplete the NK cell lineage, use has been made of an
anti-asialo-GM1, anti-NK1.1 and anti-Ly49 antibodies in a variety
of murine models [32,49,51,56–58] with polarizing results in terms
of beneficial versus detrimental clinical outcome depending on the
model utilized [32]. The use of such antibodies to deplete NK
cells, in addition, has important limitations as outlined elsewhere
[59–61] that include the specificity of the cell lineage that is
depleted. Germane to the studies reported herein, in the case of
depleting NK cells in vivo in non-human primates, use has been
made of an unique IL-2-diptheria toxin (denileukin) fusion protein
[62], a murine anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody [63,64], an
antibody with specificity for IL-15 (required for NK cells) and a
small molecule inhibitor with relative specificity for the JAK3
kinase an intra-cellular signaling molecule [65] to study the in vivo
role of NK cells. Each of these reagents have varying levels of
limitations and our laboratory thus chose to focus on optimizing
the in vivo use of a small molecule relatively selective JAK3/1
inhibitor [66] termed CP-690,550 whose activity has recently been
compared with other JAK inhibitors [67] and while initially
thought to be specific for the inhibition of JAK3, has more recently
shown to also inhibit JAK1/2. We chose to utilize CP-690,550
because the drug targets the JAK-STAT pathway utilized for NK
cell activation and JAK3, which along with JAK1 relays cytokine
signaling through the cytokine receptor common gamma chain
also known as CD132. The JAK/STAT pathway is activated not
only in NK cells but other cell lineages that in concert are involved
in the innate and early immune responses [68,69]. In addition, its
plasma in vivo levels could be easily monitored allowing for a more
objective pharmacokinetic analysis and its use in nonhuman
primates has previously shown significant in vivo activity against
NK cells [65] with limited effects on CD8+ T cell numbers, and no
effect on effector CD8+ T cell function [70]
To initiate studies for the inhibition of innate and early immune
responses using CP-690,550 (heretofore referred to as the JAK3
inhibitor) in the rhesus macaque species, a detailed in vitro
specificity and a series of in vivo safety and pharmacokinetic study
was first conducted and based on the results of the PK studies an
optimal dose was selected and utilized to define the effect of this
novel JAK3 inhibitor on influencing the course of disease in a
group of chronically SIV infected rhesus macaques. Results of
these studies constitute the basis of this report.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Source of Blood & Colo-rectal biopsy
Samples
Juvenile to adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of
Indian origin were used for the studies reported herein. The
animals were all housed at the Yerkes National Primate Research
Center (YNPRC) of Emory University (Atlanta, GA) and were
maintained according to the guidelines of the Committee on the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory
Animal Resources, National Research Council and the Depart￾ment of Health and Human Service guideline titled Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The initial in vitro and in
vivo safety and pharmacokinetic studies were performed utilizing a
group of 9 healthy rhesus macaques that initially served as normal
blood donors and then were utilized for a number of pharmaco￾kinetic studies outlined below. The subsequent in vivo studies of
CP-690,550 were conducted on a group of 6 chronically SIV
infected adult male rhesus macaques and for purposes of control
12 similarly SIV infected rhesus macaques. Each monkey was
infected intravenously with 1000 TCID50 of SIVmac239 (grown in
day 3 Con-A activated normal rhesus PBMC cultures). Viral loads
were monitored in plasma samples every week for 4 weeks, every
other week for 8 weeks and monthly thereafter, using bDNA
quantitation on aliquots of EDTA plasma by Siemens Inc.
(Berkeley, CA). Cellular viral loads in aliquots of PBMC and
colo-rectal biopsy tissue samples were monitored using a technique
previously outlined [71]. Blood and colo-rectal biopsy samples
were obtained prior to and at 1, 3, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after
initiation of the JAK inhibitor.
Ethics Statement
All animals were born and maintained at the Yerkes National
Primate Research Center of Emory University in accordance with
the regulations of the Committee on the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animal Resources. The animals are fed monkey diet
(Purina) supplemented daily with fresh fruit or vegetables and
water ad libitum. Additional enrichment including the delivery of
appropriate safe toys is provided and overseen by the Yerkes
enrichment staff and animal health is monitored daily by the
animal care staff and veterinary personnel, available 24/7.
Monkeys are caged in socially compatible same sex pairs to
facilitate social enhancement and well-being. Monkeys showing

signs of sustained weight loss, disease or distress are subject to
clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and then provided either
standard dietary supplementation analgesics and/or chemothera￾py. Monkeys whose symptoms cannot be alleviated using standard
dietary supplementation, analgesics and/or chemotherapy were
humanely euthanized using an overdose of barbiturates according
to the guidelines of the American Veterinary Medical Association.
The studies reported herein were performed under IACUC
protocol #2001186 ‘‘Innate immunity in SIV infection’’ which
was reviewed and approved by the Emory University IACUC. It
has been assigned the IACUC protocol number ‘‘YER-2001186-
082414GA’’. The Yerkes National Primate Research Center has
been fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International since
1985. All experiments were reviewed and approved by the Emory
institutional animal use and care as well as biosafety review
Committees.
CP-690,550
This JAK-3 inhibitor was either synthesized by the Chemistry
Lab at Emory University or purchased from LC Laboratories
(Woburn, MA) and an aliquot (10 mg) was a kind gift from Pfizer
Labs, Inc. (Groton, CT). The aliquot from Pfizer was utilized for
quality comparison of the other lots of the same compound. For in
vitro studies, a stock solution of the compound CP-690,550
(313 m.w.) was prepared by first dissolving it in DMSO and then
in methanol to obtain a 2 mM solution and then further diluted to
the required concentration in sterile culture medium. For the
dosing of monkeys, the compound in 0.5% methylcellulose was
incorporated in peanut butter and administered to monkeys orally
based at a loading dose of 20 mg/kg and then subsequently at
10 mg/kg daily for a period of 35 days except for the initial PK
studies that were conducted utilizing doses as described in the text.
Quantitation of plasma levels of the CP-690,550 was performed
using a reverse phase-HPLC with MS/MS with a detection level
sensitivity of 2.5 ng/ml [72]. Safety of the drug was determined by
the analysis of blood samples from the monkeys administered
30 mg/kg (highest dose) by performing complete hematologic,
metabolic, renal, liver and cardiac function tests and found to have
no detectable toxicity. All data have been recorded and on file for
purposes of reference.
*p-STAT-5 Assay
The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs)
are a family of intracellular molecules consisting of seven
transcription factors that respond to a variety of stimuli including
cytokines, hormones, and growth factors [73]. Phosphorylation of
the tyrosine residues of the STAT molecules leads to their
activation which following dimerization translocates to the nucleus
and contributes to the activation of appropriate target genes. Janus
kinases (JAKs) are the major source that leads to STAT
phosphorylation and this JAK/STAT pathway plays a critical
role in communicating cell surface dialogue into immune function
(Harrison DA). In the studies reported herein we studied the
phosphorylation of STAT5, which is mediated by several JAKs,
including JAK3 to monitor the activity of the JAK3 inhibitor.
Standard Western Blots of cell lysates were performed according
to the manufacturers instruction and with appropriate positive and
negative controls. The kit was purchased from Zeptometrix Corp,
Buffalo, NY.
In vitro NK cell assay
The JAM assay [74] was utilized to assay for the evaluation of
NK cell function in PBMC samples from rhesus macaques as our
laboratory has described elsewhere [23]. The MHC class I
negative human erythro-leukemic K562 cell line was used as a
target in these studies. The K562 cell line was obtained from
ATCC, Rockville, MD. Effector cell: target cell ratios of 50, 25,
12.5 and 6.25:1 in triplicate were used in each assay. Data are
expressed as lytic units (L.U.) per 107 effector cells as describe
elsewhere [23]. The S.D. of L.U. by the effector cells was ,10%
for all the assays performed. The in vitro assay for the effect on
NK cell function was also carried out in the presence of 50 mg/ml
of human albumin to test the potential role of serum components
and found to have minimal (,5%) effect on the NK cell functional
assay.
Flow cytometric analyses
Aliquots of ficoll-hypaque gradient purified peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mononuclear cells isolated from a
pool of colo-rectal biopsies according to techniques previously
described [71] were utilized to determine the frequencies of
varying subsets of lymphoid cells. CBC values were used to
determine the absolute numbers of each subset. A battery of
monoclonal antibody reagents that react with antigens expressed
by cells from rhesus macaques conjugated with a variety of
fluorochromes was used for polychromatic flow cytometric analysis
utilizing a LSR-II flow cytometer (B–D Immunocytometry
Division, Mountain View, CA). The uorochrome-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used in appropriate combi￾nations to stain the mononuclear cells to determine the frequencies
of cell lineages isolated from the blood and rectal biopsies with a
focus on T cell, NK cell and dendritic cell lineages. The mAbs
purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA) included
Alexa700-anti-CD3 (clone SP34-2), FITC-anti-CD8 (clone SK1
and clone RPA-T8), PerCP or Pac Blue anti-CD4 (clone L200),
FITC-anti-CD14 (clone M5E2), PerCP-Cy5.5-anti-CD16 (clone
3G8), APC-Cy7-anti-CD20 (clone 2H7), and PE-Cy7-anti-CD56
(clone NCAM16.2). The mAb purchased from Beckman Coulter
(Brea, CA) included PE-anti-NKG2a (clone Z199), the mAb
Alexa647-anti-IL-17A (clone eBio64DEC17) was purchased from
eBioscience (San Diego, CA) and the mAb APC-anti-IFN-a (clone
LT27:295) and PE/APC-anti-CD25 (clone 4E3) was purchased
from Miltenyi (Auburn, CA). Select studies utilized anti-Ki-67 and
PE-conjugated p11c-Mamu-A01*-MHC class I tetramer (courtesy
The NIH tetramer core facility, Emory University School of
Medicine, Atlanta, GA). A minimum of 40,000 events was
analyzed and the FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR) software utilized
for data analysis. Phenotypically NK cells were defined as cells that
were CD32, CD8+
, NKG2a+ which includes the 4 major subsets
of NK cells as described elsewhere [23].
Statistical analysis
All statistical including the graphical analysis was performed
using the SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The non￾parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the data
sets between groups of monkeys. The differences with a p-value
less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
Results
Studies were first carried out to establish the pharmacokinetics
and safety of the oral administration of the JAK3 inhibitor in 2
adult rhesus macaques. The monkeys received a single oral dose of
10, 20 and 30 mg/kg of the JAK inhibitor after a week long wash
out period in between. Results of these studies showed no evidence
of hematologic, liver, renal and/or metabolic toxicity at the doses
administered. Mean plasma levels of the JAK inhibitor peaked at
JAK3 Inhibition to SIV Infected Rhesus Macaques
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70992

2 hours and the trough levels appeared at about 6 hours post
administration. It was determined that dose levels of 10, 20 and
30 mg/kg resulted in trough mean plasma concentrations of
3.14+/20.08, 5.67+/21.4 and 9.44+/23.27 ng/ml, respectively.
Based on the results of phenotypic analyses and the NK cell
functional studies (see below) it was decided that a loading dose of
20 mg/kg followed by a daily dose of 10 mg/kg in adult monkeys
would provide appropriate trough levels to deplete NK cells and
was the dose to utilize and hence this dose level was utilized for all
subsequent studies.
In vitro and in vivo effect of the JAK3 inhibitor on NK cell
activity
PBMC from a total of 9 rhesus macaques were assayed for NK
cell activity in vitro using our standard NK cell functional assay. As
seen in Fig. 1A, as little as 0.1 nM of the JAK3 inhibitor
significantly (p,0.0001) reduced NK cell function showing
maximal inhibition at 5–10 nM. The calculated IC50 was shown
to be at 1nM for NK cell inhibition. In vivo functional PK studies
were performed next. Two adult rhesus macaques were orally
administered 10 mg/kg of the JAK3 inhibitor and blood samples
obtained at various time intervals and assayed for NK cell activity.
As seen in Fig. 1B significant inhibition (p,0.0001) of NK cell
function was seen as early as 1 hour and as late as 72 h following a
single dose of 10 mg/kg of the JAK3 inhibitor. These studies were
followed by dosing of 3 rhesus macaques with a daily oral dose of
10 mg/Kg for 14 days and both the frequencies of CD4+
T,
CD8+
T, B and NK cells and the functional NK cell activity of
blood samples obtained at day 0 (baseline) and days 7 and 14 were
conducted. Results of these studies clearly showed marked selective
depletion of NK cells associated with a sharp reduction
(p,0.0001) of NK cell function (Fig. 1C & D). There was also a
modest decrease in the numbers of the gated population of CD3+
CD8+ T cells that could reflect a subset of NK cells that express
these markers. Aliquots of the PBMC samples incubated in vitro
with the JAK3 inhibitor were also monitored for the phosphor￾ylation of STAT-5 (*p-STAT-5) as described in the methods
section and found to show compete inhibition (data not shown).
What was also interesting from the data obtained was the finding
that there did not appear to be any selective ordered re￾appearance of NK cell subsets post depletion during the period
of reconstitution. Thus, as we have established before, there are at
least 4 subsets of NK cells in rhesus macaques [23]. These include
the CD32, CD8+
, NKG2a+ that are CD16+
, CD562 (the major
cytolytic subset), those that are CD162, CD56+ (cytokine
synthesizing) and the CD162, CD562 and the CD16+
, CD56+
subsets. In addition, there are also the NK-17 cells and the NKregs
[6]. Careful detailed polychromatic flow cytometric analysis of
PBMC’s for these subsets of NK cells from all 6 monkeys
administered the JAK3 inhibitor failed to show any specific
pattern of subset evolvement at least in the PBMC samples. Thus,
at least phenotypically, we were unable to show the emergence of
one particular NK cell subset over another in order to make the
case for a correlation between cell surface markers and progenitor
to mature cell development using PBMC samples. The reasons for
this are unclear at present.
Effect of the in vivo administration of the JAK3 inhibitor
on cell subsets and viral loads in SIV infected rhesus
macaques
The primary objective of this study was to determine the in vivo
role of the JAK3 inhibitor, if any, on influencing viral loads in
monkeys chronically infected with SIV. Three monkeys were
selected that were classified as spontaneous controllers with one
showing low levels and 2/3 showing undetectable plasma viremia
and 3 additional monkeys that displayed relatively higher viral
loads (.100,000 viral copies/ml of plasma) in efforts to determine
if differences in viral loads influenced the outcome of the
administration of the JAK3 inhibitor. Plasma specimens were
monitored for viral loads prior to and weekly intervals for 4 weeks,
bi-weekly until 14 weeks post administration of the JAK3
inhibitor. PBMC’s and colo-rectal biopsies were monitored for
the frequency of mononuclear cell subsets by standard flow
cytometry, cellular viral loads prior to, at 1, 3, 6, 8 and 12 weeks
Figure 1. The effect of the JAK3 inhibitor on rhesus macaque

normal rhesus macaques were orally administered 10 mg/kg of the

post JAK3 administration and for NK function. An aliquot of the
PBMC was also monitored for *p-STAT-5.
Due to marked differences in plasma viral loads accompanied
by marked variations in the absolute number of various lymphoid
cell subsets at baseline in the individual animals being studied, the
data on phenotypic analysis of subsets of PBMC are illustrated to a
large extent as a percent of baseline values. For purposes of
reference, the absolute numbers of each major subset at baseline is
illustrated in Supplemental Fig. S1. As seen in Fig. 2A, the
administration of the JAK3 inhibitor at the doses specified led to a
decrease (p,0.01) in the frequencies of CD4+ T cells in the PBMC
with a nadir at week 3, but with no detectable net change in the
frequencies of CD4+ T cells in the colo-rectal tissues (data not
shown). Analysis of subsets of CD4+ T cells in these samples
showed a decrease (p,0.05) in the relative frequencies of CD4+
naı¨ve (CD28+
, CD952, CCR7+
) at week 6 and 8 and an increase
(p,0.05) in the central memory (CM) CD4+ T cells (CD28+
,
CD95+
, CCR7+
) at week one and an increase (p,0.03) in the
effector memory (EM) CD4+ T cells (CD282, CD95+
, CCR72) at
week 6 (Fig. 2B). There was also a significant decrease in the
frequencies of CD8+ T cells at weeks 1, 3 and 5 (p,0.05) but was
followed soon thereafter with a return to baseline values (Fig. 2C).
Major findings of the subset analysis of CD8+ T cells showed a
marked decrease in the frequencies of CM CD8+ T cells at one
week (p,0.001) but followed by marked sustained increase
(p,0.01) thereafter (Fig. 2D). Of interest there were no statistical
difference in the numbers of CD3+
, CD8+ T cells in the
corresponding gut tissues. A study of these same subsets in a
cohort of 12 similarly chronically SIV infected rhesus macaques
studied in parallel basically showed a gradual decrease in CD4+ T
cells with an increase in the frequencies of CD8+ T cells but the
differences were not as striking as those outlined above following
JAK3 inhibitor administration (data not shown for purposes of
brevity). However, of all the changes noted with the administration
of the JAK3 inhibitor, the most marked change (p,0.0001) noted
was in the number of CD32, CD8+
, NKG2a+ (NK cells) both in
the PBMC and the colo-rectal biopsy tissues (see Fig. 3 A and B).
Thus there appeared to be between 80–90% depletion of the NK
cells from both the blood and gut tissues starting at one week of
initiation of JAK3 inhibitor administration and sustained until
6 weeks following cessation of drug therapy in the PBMC. It is of
interest to note, however, that, whereas the numbers of NK cells
gradually started returning to baseline values in the blood, the
values of NK cells in the colo-rectal tissues remained low until
week 12 and up to the time period these animals were followed
(.36 weeks). The frequencies of the IL-17 synthesizing NK cells
(NK-17) were also monitored as previously described [6]. The
frequencies of the NK-17 cells were reduced to undetectable levels
in both the PBMC and colo-rectal biopsy tissues. Data on analysis
of the 4 major subsets of NK cells basically mirrored the profile
seen with the total NKG2a+ population (Fig. 4 A, B, C and D) with
marked decreases at week 1, 3, and 5 (p,0.0001) to a gradual
return to baseline values at weeks 6 and in most cases an increase
at week 8. Functional studies on NK cell activity was also
monitored and found to be below the level of detection in our
standard NK cell assay for samples from 1 to 6 weeks that
returned to normal pre-baseline levels thereafter (data not shown).
Plasma viral loads and colo-rectal biopsy tissue pro-viral loads
were monitored in these same monkeys in efforts to determine the
effect of JAK3 inhibitor administration. It should be noted, we had
purposely selected 3 monkeys that had high viral loads (HVL) and
3 with low to undetectable levels of viremia to determine if the
level of viral loads at the initiation of JAK3 inhibitor administra￾tion would play a role. As seen in Fig. 5 A & B (both log and
arithmetic scale viral loads are shown due to the differences in the
levels in the 2 subset of monkeys), 2/3 monkeys in each of the 2
subset show a modest but significant increase in plasma viral loads
at about 1–2 weeks of JAK3 inhibitor administration which
gradually returned to pre-JAK3 inhibitor administration levels
shortly following cessation of drug administration. The levels of
pro-viral DNA in the gut tissues also increased to different levels in
all 6 animals (Fig. 5 C), with the 3 monkeys with lower plasma VL,
RVa, RIz and RMa having lower cellular VL than the other 3
with higher plasma VL. Five of the 6 monkeys clearly also showed
a marked increase in gut tissue VL (Fig. 5C) denoting that
treatment with the JAK3 inhibitor had effects on gut tissue VL.
The fold increase although transient appeared of interest to be
more significant in the 3 animals with low to undetectable viremia
(5–6 fold) as compared with the 3 animals that had high viral loads

(approx. 2 fold). Analysis of the colo-rectal biopsy tissues for the
frequencies of CD4+ T cells, as mentioned above, failed to show
any marked differences from previous baseline levels suggesting
that the increases noted was not due to increased frequencies of
CD4+ T cells but likely due to increased viral output per infected
cell.
Discussion
The results of the studies reported herein show that this JAK
inhibitor clearly has potent inhibitory effect on NK cells in vitro
and that the in vivo administration of this inhibitor which was
previously thought to be specific for JAK3 [75–77] but has
recently been shown to have a broader JAK species activity
[67,78], based on the doses tested, did indeed result in marked
depletion of the NK cell lineage with relatively smaller depletion of
the other cell lineages. Such depletion appears to result in modest
but detectable increases in plasma and gut tissue viral loads in all
rhesus macaques chronically infected with SIV. It is of interest to
note that these increases were seen in monkeys with both low to
undetectable viral loads and also in monkeys with significantly
high viral loads suggesting that the drug and/or depletion of the
NK cells induces the neo-activation of cryptically infected target
cells but could also lead to higher viral load output from the cells
previously replicating virus. A number of issues from these studies
need address. First of all, are the increases in plasma and gut tissue
viral loads really significant and/or meaningful? What is the
specificity of this JAK inhibitor and specially its effect on other cell
lineages? What are the reasons for the lack of gut tissue NK cell
replacement and its implications? What cell lineage(s) is the source
of the emergence of viremia following drug administration in the
animals with low to undetectable viremia? Does this depletion of
NK cells lead to any changes in the adaptive immune response of
the animals? Attempts were made to address each of these issues.
The first issue concerns the significance of the changes in
plasma and gut tissue viral loads. While statistical analysis of the
data failed to show significance, it is clear that the trend for
increased viral load was evident for all 6 animals. It appears that a
much larger cohort of animals needs to be studied to derive
statistically valid data. Of note are the levels of differences in the 2
sets of animals with differences in baseline plasma viral loads.
Thus, 2/3 animals with undetectable plasma viral loads showed a
peak increase to 2261 and 25635 viral copies/ml and the 3rd
animal showed an increase from 1962 to a peak level of 16139
viral copies/ml. Of the monkeys with higher baseline plasma viral
loads, the peak increases noted were from 618,967 to 2,984,174
copies/ml, from 101,380 to 740,217 copies/ml and 188,972 to
6,591,000 copies/ml. The fold increases in GI tissue viral loads
paralleled that noted in the plasma. Thus, 2/3 with undetectable
viral loads increased to peak levels of 18 and 12 copies/ng DNA
and the 3rd increased from 4 copies to peak levels of 22 copies/ng
DNA. The monkeys with higher baseline GI tissues viral loads

increased from 12, 15 and 22 copies/ng DNA to peak levels of 26,
18 and 41 copies/ng DNA, respectively. Two issues seem obvious.
Firstly, the fact that both the plasma and GI tissue viral loads
appear to return to baseline levels indicates that some regulatory
mechanisms maybe operable in these animals. Phenotypic analyses
appear to indicate that the rapid return of NK cells directly
correlates with the reduction of plasma and gut tissue viral loads.
While one can argue whether this is truly due to the return of the
NK cell lineage, results from a study performed by Dr. M. C.
Gauduin seems to support that this is likely due to NK cells
(personal communication). Thus, the study involved the depletion
of CD8+ cells in a group of chronically SIV infected rhesus
macaques following treatment with ART. The question being
addressed was whether CD8+ cells were regulating viral reservoirs.
The plasma viral loads rapidly increased in these animals but
returned to set point levels but this decrease to set point levels was
associated with the return of classic CD16+
, CD562, NKG2a+ NK
cells [79] but not either CD3+ CD8+ T cells and/or the
frequencies of Mamu-A01-p11C tetramer+ cells. These data
suggest that the NK cells are likely the cells initially involved in
decreases of viral loads. The second issues with regards to the
studies reported herein concerns whether the increases in viral
load is due to more viral output from cells already producing virus
or is it due to the neo-activation of latently infected cells? We are

currently attempting to address both these issue in a separate study
of SIV infected Elite Controller rhesus macaques.
With regards to the specificity of the JAK3 inhibitor, while these
studies were initiated at a time when the published data supported
the view that the drug had high specificity for JAK3, it is becoming
increasingly apparent that the drug inhibits JAK1 and to some
degree also JAK2. Some discussion on the JAK/STAT pathway
thus appears appropriate. There are some excellent reviews on this
subject [68,80] and thus will only be summarized here. The Janus
kinases are a family of 4 enzymes JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine
kinase 2 (TYK2) that are integrally involved in intracellular
signaling. Each JAK family enzyme is involved and inter￾connected with individual cytokine receptor mediated signaling
cascades through the corresponding enzymes of signal transducers
and activators of transcription (STAT) family. JAK3 acts in
concert with JAK1 to transmit signaling via the cytokine receptor
common gamma chain. JAK2 is important in signaling mediated
by hormones and growth factors such as erythropoietin and GM￾CSF via the IL-3R beta chain. JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 are
involved in IL-6 signaling. The JAK-STAT induced signaling
events are in turn negatively regulated by the suppressors of
cytokine signaling (SOCS). What is interesting is that each of these
enzymes appear to be activated by specific cytokines which makes
the identification of inhibitors specific for each enzyme translate
into the targeting of specific diseases. This is precisely the reason
for an enormous interest by the pharmaceutical industry on
identifying inhibitors of specific JAK/STAT enzymes [78]. The
commercial name for CP-690,550 is Tofacitinib and the trade
name is Xeljanz and this drug has shown promising results in
clinical trials for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis [81,82]. Given
the inter-connectivity between the various JAK’s, it is thus not
surprising that the administration of the JAK3 inhibitor affected
several cell lineages. Based on the data reported herein, however,
it seems that there does appear to be an effect of dose on the scope
of cell lineages that become affected. Clearly, the most affected cell
population at the doses utilized herein appeared to be the NK cell
lineage. This could be due to the density of the high affinity IL-2R
expressed by the NK cells. Nonetheless, it is clear that the data
obtained with the use of this JAK3 inhibitor has to be interpreted
with caution.
Attempts were made to draw parallels between NK cell subsets
depletion/re-emergence in the SIV infected monkeys with
observations of NK cell subsets in humans. Thus, it is clear that
there are at least 2 major phenotypically defined subsets in human.
Those that express CD56low/CD16+
, a major cytolytic subset and
those that express CD56bright/CD16low, the major cytokine
synthesizing subset [83]. The major CD56low/CD16+ subset is
also heterogeneous and composed of cells that are CD122+
/
CCR72 and CD1222/CCR7+
. The former subset (CD122+/
CCR72) has been shown to be expanded following HIV-1
infection that also express the senescence marker CD57 [84]and is
likely the same subset that shows increased KIR expression [85].
As noted above, the finding of .90% depletion of the NK cell
lineage in the PBMC and GI tissues prompted us to determine if
the re-emergence rate of the various NK cell subset will provide
clues as to the pattern of differentiation of this cell lineage as
outlined by our lab previously [86]. Unfortunately, no clear
pattern emerged, as it appeared that each of the 4 major subsets
including the human equivalent of the cytolytic and cytokine
producing subset appeared with a tempo that reflected their
individual frequencies prior to depletion. The reason for this
finding is not clear at present and may be because we only sampled
the blood/GI tissues and not the bone marrow and the sampling
of the GI tissue was conducted between large intervals of time. In
this regard, it is also of interest to us that once depleted in the GI
tissue, this cell lineage did not reconstitute in this tissue location
but appeared to be replaced by fibrosis (data not shown). This
finding was surprising and is being currently studied. Preliminary
data seem to indicate that the JAK3 inhibitor markedly inhibits
the expression of the gut homing molecules a4b7 and CCR9 by
NK cells in vitro. However, this does not explain the failure of NK
cells to express such gut homing molecules at a time period when
the presence of the drug in vivo is highly unlikely. Studies of KIR
expression by these NK cells prior to and following SIV infection
has also been studied by our laboratory and reported elsewhere
[87].
With regards to the source of the modest increase in viremia, it
is clear that the source of the virus in monkeys that had
undetectable plasma viremia at baseline was from CD4+ T cells
as determined by in situ hybridization analysis. However, it is not
clear as the source of virus in animals, which had high plasma
viremia. This question while simple at face value is in fact a very
difficult issue to address since there is currently no acceptable assay
to measure burst size for SIV. This question has important
implication in the field of HIV/SIV research. Thus we do not
know if changes in viremia are due to increased output from a cell
or due to increase in the number of cells that are secreting virus.
Even if this is addressed, the issue as to whether the virus being
measured is dead or alive (since we utilize PCR) and/or is
replication competent or not remains an open question.
We did attempt to determine whether depletion of NK cells had
any effect on adaptive immune responses in these monkeys. Thus,
we measured levels of anti-SIV antibodies by ELISA and
performed ELISPOT assays to determine whether differences
could be detected. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect any
reproducible difference in either the levels of anti-SIV antibody
and/or the number of ELISPOT values when compared to either
baseline values and/or values obtained on the control SIV infected
monkeys assayed in parallel. This is not surprising since a role for
NK cells on modulating adaptive immune responses during
chronic infection is likely to be limited. It should be noted that
monitoring of the appearance of Ki67 expressing cells clearly
indicated that following cessation of JAK3 inhibitor therapy, there
appeared to be a marked increase in the NK cell lineage to
preferentially express Ki67.
Taken together, the data presented herein indicate that the
administration of the JAK3 inhibitor to chronically SIV infected
rhesus macaques leads to a modest but consistent increase in
plasma viremia and an increase in the levels of viremia in the GI
tissue of these animals. This increase appeared to be associated
with a loss of multiple cell lineages chief among them though being
cells of the NK cell lineage. Studies are currently underway to
assess the effect of JAK3 inhibitor administration during acute SIV
infection in a large number of rhesus macaques, the finding of
which will be published shortly. The data presented herein
therefore lays the foundation for these additional studies.
