Summary
QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: The field of heart trans￾plantation has seen substantial progress in the last 40 years.
The breakthroughs in long-term survival were followed by
a period of stagnation in the last decade. This review sum￾marises current recommendations for the identification of
candidates for heart transplantation and their immunologic￾al and non-immunological postoperative follow-up.
RESULTS: The progress made in the treatment of patients
with advanced heart failure has considerably changed the
profile of candidates for heart transplantation. Patients are
older, and the load of co-morbidities is more important re￾quiring careful evaluation for candidacy. Long-standing re￾search in the field of immunosuppression made available
various drugs, which decrease the risk of acute allograft
rejection and prolong survival after heart transplantation.
Powerful new molecules are entering early phase clinical
studies, suggesting further improvement in the near future.
As a consequence, treatment of non-immunological co￾morbidity after heart transplantation will gain in import￾ance, however, the base of evidence guiding current recom￾mendations is poor.
CONCLUSIONS: The substantial progress in heart failure
treatment and immunosuppression after heart transplanta￾tion has changed the profile of heart transplant recipients.
The arrival of new molecules will provide additional al￾Abbreviations

Survival with heart transplantation
It has been over 40 years since Christian Barnard per￾formed the first human-to-human heart transplantation.
After early enthusiasm subsided, dedicated and steady re￾search has ultimately led to an era with encouraging long￾term results in heart transplantation: median survival after
HTx increased significantly from 8.3 years in the 80’s to
10.4 years in the 90’s. Analysis of outcome data of the
ISHLT registry (n = 80038) suggests another non-signi￾ficant increase in survival for the period 2000 to June
2008 [1]. For Switzerland, respective data are not available.
Figure 1 represents HTx activity as documented by Swis￾stransplant.
When to consider heart
transplantation
The ACCF/AHA guidelines for the diagnosis and manage￾ment of HF in adults have more recently presented another
approach to the classification of HF, emphasising both clin￾ical and structural characteristics of the disease [2]. In do￾ing so, four stages were identified with stage D designating
patients with truly refractory HF despite maximal medic￾Figure 1

al therapy. Hallmarks of these patients are recurrent hospit￾alisation, and the requirement of specialised interventions
such as continuous or periodic treatment with positive ino￾tropic drugs, re-synchronisation, cardiac surgery, TAVI for
symptomatic aortic stenosis, MitralClip® placement for
symptomatic mitral valve insufficiency, MCS, heart trans￾plantation, or palliative care. Ideally, a local “Heart team”
representing respective expertise should discuss the differ￾ent treatment options in every patient with advanced heart
failure. Because of the painful shortage of donor hearts, this
discussion is likewise recommended even when patients
are potential candidates for heart transplantation.
Indication for heart transplantation
The main indication of HTx is persistent advanced chronic
heart failure despite optimal medical treatment of left
ventricular dysfunction. For candidacy, the patients will
have to fulfill various criteria (table 1) with cardiopulmon￾ary exercise testing playing the central role. Nevertheless,
the decision on a candidacy for HTx should take into ac￾count all clinical data rather than focusing on peak oxygen
uptake alone [3], and, usually, is obtained after multidiscip￾linary discussion.
The timing of referral is of central importance and, ideally,
potential HTx candidates should be presented to a respect￾ive centre ahead of the manifestation of other organ dys￾functions related to heart failure (e.g., cardiorenal syn￾drome, pulmonary hypertension, liver dysfunction, meta￾bolic syndrome). Indicators that should prompt considera￾tion for referral are indicated in table 2.
Table 1: Criteria for heart transplantation.
Common criteria
1. Impaired left ventricular systolic dysfunction
2. NYHA III (e.g., patient cannot climb one flight of stairs without
dyspnoea) or IV symptoms
3. Receiving optimal medical treatment on maximal dosage tolerated
4. CRT, ICD or CRTD implanted when indicated
5. Evidence of poor prognosis on the basis of cardiopulmonary
exercise testing (VO2max <12 ml/kg/min if on β-blockade, and <14
ml/min/kg if not on β-blockade, ensuring respiratory equivalent ratio
≤1.05) markedly elevated NT-proBNP (or BNP) serum levels despite
of optimal medical treatment established composite prognostic
scoring system (HFSS, SHFM)
Uncommon criteria
1. Persisting haemodynamically compromising ventricular arrhythmia
refractory to all usual treatment
2. Refractory angina where there is clear evidence of recurrent
debilitating myocardial ischaemia not amenable to conventional
treatment
3. Restrictive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with persistent
NYHA III and IV symptoms and/or recurrent hospitalisation for with
acute heart failure.
BNP = brain natriuretic peptide; CRT = cardiac resynchronisation;
CRTD = CRT and ICD treatment; HFSS = heart failure survival score;
ICD = internal cardiac defibrillator; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro-BNP;
NYHA = New York Heart Association; SHFM = Seattle heart failure
model.
Risk factors and contraindications to
heart transplantation
HTx aims both at the improvement of symptoms and the
prolongation of patient survival. Therefore, other organ
dysfunction not likely to improve, posttransplant, may pre￾clude HTx in the individual patient. In contrast, other organ
dysfunction often does not preclude HTx if related with the
severity of HF and thus likely to improve after HTx.
Advanced heart failure is most often associated with renal,
hepatic, pulmonary, and metabolic dysfunction. Discrimin￾ation of reversible from irreversible other organ dysfunc￾tion requires careful medical work-up and subspecialty ex￾pertise. Some more general recommendations are de￾scribed below.
Comorbidities
Cardiorenal syndrome: Impaired renal function is an inde￾pendent risk factor of mortality both in HF [4] and after
HTx [5]. The international guidelines for the care of HTx
candidates recommend precluding potential HTx candid￾ates from single organ transplantation when the estimated
glomerular filtration rate is <40 ml/min/1.73 m2
[3, 6].
Liver dysfunction is a predictor of adverse outcome after
HTx. Abnormal standard liver function tests are common
in HF and elevated bilirubin has been related to increased
mortality after HTx [1, 7]. In patients with chronic right
HF and venous hypertension or refractory ascites extensive
diagnostic work-up is obligatory in order to assess the indi￾vidual potential of liver dysfunction reversibility [3].
Secondary pulmonary hypertension without adequate re￾sponse to pharmacological pulmonary vasodilation
presents a contraindication to orthotopic HTx due to in￾creased mortality posttransplant [3, 6, and ref. there].
Several studies indicate successful treatment of this
therapy-resistant secondary pulmonary hypertension with
permanent left ventricular MCS treatment [8] suggesting
that this treatment option can be discussed on a case by
case basis.
Metabolic dysfunction is common with advanced heart fail￾ure and not an absolute contraindication when glycaemia
is under control (glycosylated haemoglobin <7.5%) [5, 6].
In general, microvascular complication other than non-pro￾liferative retinopathy is usually considered as absolute
Table 2: Clinical indicators that should prompt consideration for
referral.
1. Two or more admissions for treatment of decompensated heart
failure within the last 12 months
2. Persistent clinical evidence of overt heart failure despite of
optimised heart failure treatment
3. Calculated score suggesting a 1-year mortality ≥20%
4. Echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular dysfunction and
increasing pulmonary artery pressure on optimal medical treatment
5. Anaemia, involuntary weight loss, liver dysfunction, hyponatremia
attributable to heart failure
6. Deteriorating renal function attributable to heart failure or inability
to tolerate diuretic dosages sufficient to clear congestion without
change in renal function
7. Significant episodes of ventricular arrhythmia despite of full drug
and electrophysiological/device treatment
8. Increasing BNP / NT-proBNP levels despite optimal medical
treatment.

contra-indication to HTx. A pre-transplant BMI >30/m2
is
a relevant risk factor, and obese patients are required to lose
weight before listing [6]. In the UK, patients with >32/m2
are unlikely to be accepted [3].
Not HF related comorbidities
Common co-morbidities presenting absolute contra-indica￾tion to HTx are listed in table 3. Progress in medicine is fast
and may, in the individual patient, permit treatment of non
HF related comorbidities generally considered as contra-in￾dication to HTx [6]. Therefore, discussion with experts in
the respective subspecialty is recommended.
Demographics of heart transplant
recipients
In the past decade, recipient demographics have shown
a shift in the leading diagnosis for which HTx was per￾formed from ischaemic cardiomyopathy to dilated cardi￾omyopathy. Furthermore, the proportion of patients in their
60’s is increasing despite an unchanged median age of HTx
recipients [1]. In addition, the load of comorbidity is rising,
and the number of patients bridged to transplant with MCS
support has grown from about 20% in the past 10 years to
30% in 2009 [1]. Respective data of Swiss HTx recipients
are missing but may be available from the STCS prospect￾ively collecting data of all HTx recipients as of May 2008.
Donor heart allocation
Table 3: Contraindication to heart transplantation.
Absolute contraindication
1. Sepsis and active infection
2. Recent pulmonary embolism
3. Active malignancy other than localised non-melanoma skin cancer
4. Infiltrative cardiac disease with extensive extracardiac
manifestation
Relative contraindication
1. symptomatic peripheral or cerebrovascular disease
2. chronic viral infection
3. autoimmune disorder
4. skeletal myopathy with good mid-term outlook
5. substance abuse ( tobacco, excessive alcohol consumption)
6. history of prior non-adherence
Figure 2
HTx waiting list characteristics (adapted from annual
Swisstransplant reports).
In recent years, the gap has widened between the number
of allocated donor hearts and the number of patients await￾ing HTx in Switzerland. Subsequently, the number of pa￾tients on the waiting list as well as the time of HTx candid￾acy has increased in Switzerland (fig. 2) and elsewhere [1,
5]. In addition, mortality on the waiting list has increased
in some countries [1, 5] while remaining stable in Switzer￾land (fig. 2).
In an attempt to decrease mortality on the waiting list, the
donor heart allocation algorithm was adapted in the United
Network of Organ Sharing in the United States. This adapt￾ation favours allocation of donor hearts for patients wait￾ing in urgent status and increased the respective percentage
from 74% to 92% [9]. While decreasing mortality on the
waiting list by 17% [10], this strategy prioritises allocation
of donor hearts to patients waiting on the urgent list; setting
patients on the normal waiting list at a disadvantage.
The Swiss transplantation law mandates equality of organ
attribution for all patients on the waiting list. Therefore, the
delay between time of listing and HTx is in Switzerland,
at large, a function of the time on the waiting list provided
that other criteria of the allocation algorithm such as blood
group and donor/recipient body weight match. Since urgent
listing bypasses the normal waiting list, several criteria are
defined in the enactment of the transplantation law (article
4) demanding that candidates:
– receive positive inotropic or vasoactive support and
remain under continued medical surveillance
(paragraph 1a);
– are on mechanical circulatory support complicated by
inherent disorder (e.g., mechanical disorder, secondary
haematologic disorder, and others) (paragraph 1b);
– present recalcitrant transplant rejection (paragraph 1c)
– show co-morbidity associated with dismal prognosis
comparable to the preceding conditions (paragraph
1d).
Between 2000 and 2009, the percentage of HTx in urgent
status increased in Switzerland to a peak of 63% in 2009.
In parallel, the overall time on the waiting list increased
from a minimum of 79 days in 2002 [11] to a maximum
of 257 days in 2008 (fig. 2) [12] suggesting non-equality
of donor heart attribution. In anticipation of growing disad￾vantage of HTx candidates on the normal waiting list, the
Swisstransplant Audit Group Heart (STAH) implemented
in 2010 an unsolicited consensus aiming to limit HTx in ur￾gent status to a 30% level of the annual total of all HTx.
This consensus being active as of 2011 has been widely re￾spected (2011: 8 urgent HTx /total of 36 HTx; 2012: 8/35;
2013: 7/33) without concomitant increase in waiting list
mortality (fig. 2).
Standard immunosuppressive drugs
Standard immunosuppression
The advances in adult heart transplantation are largely
based on the contemporary immunosuppression consisting
of CNI (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) (Recommendation
Class IIa, level of evidence A), inhibitors of purine syn￾thesis such as MMF or azathioprine, and corticosteroids
Review article: Current opinion Swiss Med Wkly. 2014;144:w13977

in the immediate postoperative phase (Recommendation
Class IIa, level of evidence B) [13].
mTOR inhibition (recommendation Class IIa, level of
evidence B)
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a regulator
protein playing an important role in growth-factor driven
proliferation of a number of cell types, such as smooth
vascular smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. De novo
immunosuppression with mTOR inhibitors sirolimus and
everolimus is shown to effectively prevent acute cellular
rejection when combined with standard dose cyclosporine
[14, 15]. Recently, reduced cyclosporine dose with ever￾olimus at 1.5 mg/d was shown to be non-inferior to
standard-dose cyclosporine with 3 g/d MMF [16] in a mul￾ticentre, open-label, randomised–controlled trial in de novo
HTx recipients using a larger composite endpoint (biopsy￾proven rejection, acute rejection with haemodynamic com￾promise, graft loss/retransplant, and death or loss of
follow-up). A pre-specified subgroup analysis of this study
focusing on renal function revealed no significant differ￾ence between standard treatment and everolimus treatment
at 1.5 mg/d with cyclosporine dose achieving reduced cyc￾losporine levels [16]. Overall, patients on everolimus at
1.5 mg/d with reduced cyclosporine dose presented more
non-fatal severe adverse events (70.3% vs 55.6%; 95%
CI 1.11–1.44) [16]. Similar to previous reports [14, 15],
progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) was
slowed in patients receiving everolimus at 1.5 mg/d and
reduced cyclosporine [16]. Case reports and small series
had suggested an increased incidence of incisional wound
healing complications in de novo HTx recipients receiving
mTOR inhibition. However, a meta-analysis of de novo
HTx recipients on everolimus treatment reviewing 1,009
patients from three randomised controlled trials did not
confirm this observation [17].
In maintenance HTx patients, switching immunosuppress￾ants to mTOR inhibition was proven to improve outcome
in HTx recipients with renal dysfunction [18], CAV [19],
or malignancy [20, 21].
In acknowledgement of the promising profile of mTOR in￾hibitors, the NHLB working group on future directions of
clinical research in HTx recommends clinical investigation
of CNI-free regimen or early weaning of CNI in de novo
and maintenance HTx recipients [22].
The 2010 guidelines for the care of HTx recipients recom￾mend inclusion of sirolimus and everolimus in contempor￾ary immunosuppressive regimens [13].
Perspective in immunosuppressive
treatment
Specific tolerance
The tremendous progress in transplantation medicine bases
on our understanding of cell-mediated acute rejection and
the development of immunosuppressive drugs targeting
crucial signaling pathways of T-cell activation [23]. More
recently, regulatory T-cells (Treg) [24] were shown to sup￾press immune response to foreign antigens in the context of
transplantation [25], and, therefore, may mediate preven￾tion from rejection.
So far, B cells were largely considered as simple antibody
secreting cells with a role in antibody-mediated acute rejec￾tion. While there is evidence that regulatory B-cells play a
role in autoimmune disease [26], their role in transplanta￾tion is unknown.
First experience with specific tolerance was obtained in
kidney transplant recipients using donor haematopoietic
cell transplantation for nonmyeloablative induction of
mixed chimerism. Results from a respective protocol of
human leucocyte antigen-mismatched kidney allografts are
promising [27], however, results from a clinical trial in
HTx recipients conducted at the University of Louisville,
USA, are pending [28].
Inhibition of CD28/B7 T-cell costimulatory receptors
CD28 is an important co-stimulatory molecule involved in
T-cell proliferation at the time of antigen recognition. This
suggests that inhibition of CD28/B7 T cell co-stimulatory
receptors may present a highly specific way of immun￾osuppression [29]. In animal models, inhibition of CD28
results in reduced T cell proliferation and prolonged graft
survival. Betalacept is a humanised immunoglobulin de￾tecting a human homologue of CD28 and has been ap￾proved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in
renal transplantation based on its non-inferiority to stand￾ard cyclosporine combination therapy [30]. However, pa￾tients with betalacept treatment are at increased risk for
lymphoproliferative disorder predominantly involving the
central nervous system, furthermore, tuberculosis is ob￾served more often [31].
Allosensitisation and the risk of antibody-mediated
humoral rejection
Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 (anti-B-cell) monoclonal
antibody, in combination with intravenous immune
globulin has been proven to be effective as a desensitisation
regimen in kidney transplantation candidates with allo￾sensitisation [32]. A clinical trial applying rituximab in
HTx candidates is currently ongoing [33].
Plasmapheresis in conjunction with bortezomib treatment
decreases antibody production in sensitised heart trans￾plantation candidates without adequate response to treat￾ment with intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab
[34]. However, use of bortezomib is associated with an in￾creased risk for infection and peripheral neuropathy [31,
34].
Eculizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody directed
against the terminal complement protein C5. Binding of
eculizumab blocks the cleavage of C5 and halts formation
of the membrane attack complex. In renal transplantation,
eculizumab has been shown to decrease the incidence of
early antibody-mediated rejection in recipients with high
levels of donor-specific alloantibody [35].
Multiorgan transplantation
The incidence of multiorgan transplantation including
heart-kidney or heart-liver, and heart-lung has increased
steadily over the years but remains low overall [1]. Surviv￾al after multiorgan transplantation is comparable to heart

transplantation on the basis of the Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network in the United States. Surprisingly,
a lower incidence of acute cellular rejection and CAV is ob￾served in multiorgan transplant recipients suggesting pro￾tective immune modulation [36]. Results from a recent
meta-analysis suggest that simultaneous heart- and kidney
transplantation should be considered in HTx candidates
with more severe kidney disease because of prolonged sur￾vival of the renal allograft when compared to sequential
transplantation [37].
Treatment of transplant vasculopathy
CAV is a significant contributor to posttransplant mortality.
The ISHLT registry documents a small but significant de￾crease in the cumulative incidence of CAV in the years
2002–2008 when compared to preceding decades. Never￾theless, the incidence of CAV remains significant with 8%
at 1 year, 20% at 3 years, 30% at 5 years, and more than
50% over 10 years [1]. In general, CAV is most relevant
for long-term mortality, nevertheless, diagnosis of CAV
is associated with 10% mortality within the following 12
months. Factors known to increase the risk of CAV are
donor and recipient age, donor history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, as well as mismatch of body size or donor/
recipient human leucocyte antigen. Finally, a significant
interaction between CAV and donor/recipient gender mis￾match has been observed [1]. The guidelines for
perioperative-postoperative care of HTx recipients [13] re￾commend:
1. Use of statins to reduce CAV and improve long-term
outcome.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence A
2. Prevention of CAV on the basis of strict control of
cardiovascular risk factors as well as strategies to
prevent CMV infection.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C
3. Annual or biannual coronary angiography to assess
development of CAV especially in patients with renal
insufficiency.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C
4. Follow-up coronary angiography after percutaneous
coronary intervention at 6 months interval.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C
5. In HTx recipients with established CAV the substitution
of MMF or AZA by mTOR inhibition.
Recommendation Class IIa, level of evidence B
6. Percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stents for
treatment of appropriate discrete lesions.
Recommendation Class IIa, level of evidence C
Non-immunologic treatment after
heart transplantation
Since long-term survival after HTx is improving, there is
a growing need for evidence-based strategies that reduce
long-term mortality resulting from non-immunological risk
[1]. Based on the actual understanding of cardiovascular
risk factors in the population, preservation of renal func￾tion, prevention and treatment of lipid disorder and
glycaemia, as well as blood pressure control should have
the potential for significant impact on long-term outcome
after HTx. However, respective evidence in the form of
randomised controlled trials is largely missing as emphas￾ised recently by the Working Group of the NHLB Institute
[28].
Hypertension after heart transplantation
Arterial hypertension is common after HTx.
1. Antihypertensive treatment has benefits in HTx
recipients similar to those in the general population.
Treatment of hypertension after HTx should achieve
the same goals recommended for the general
population.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C
2. Choice of antihypertensive drug treatment remains
empiric with wide use of calcium channel blockers
while ACE inhibition and ARB may be preferred in
HTx patients with diabetes.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C
3. Lifestyle modification as well as modification of
concomitant cardiovascular risk factors are appropriate
adjuncts to facilitate blood pressure control after HTx.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C
4. Adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy, especially
corticosteroid weaning, may be helpful in the
management of hypertension in HTx recipients.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
Chronic kidney disease after HTx
1. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with the modified diet
in renal disease (MDRD) equation, urine analysis, and
spot urine/albumin ratio should be obtained at least
yearly after HTx. Measurement of serum creatinine for
estimation of GFR should be obtained more often in
patients with GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2
, and in HTx
recipients with fast GFR decline in the past (>4 ml/
min/1.73 m2
per year).
Recommendation class I, level of evidence C.
2. HTx recipients with an estimated GFR <30 ml/min/1.73
m
2
, proteinuria >500 mg/d (or albumin/creatinine ratio
>500 mg/g), or rapidly declining GFR (see above)
should be referred to a nephrologist for management
of metabolic abnormalities and other complications of
renal insufficiency and consideration of renal
transplantation.
Recommendation class I, level of evidence C.
3. CNI exposure should be lowered in HTx recipients to
the minimum level required for effective
immunosuppression.
Recommendation class I, level of evidence B.
4. Interventions proven to slow progression of chronic
kidney disease in the general population should be
considered in all HTx recipients. These include strict
glucose and blood pressure control and respective
medical treatment based on the respective guidelines.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
5. Haemoglobin levels should be measured at least once
per year in all HTx recipients with chronic kidney
disease. If anaemia is detected (Hb <13.5 g/dl in adult
men; <12 g/dl in adult females), iron status should be
controlled and erythropoiesis-stimulating treatment
Review article: Current opinion Swiss Med Wkly. 2014;144:w13977
Swiss Medical Weekly · PDF of the online version · www.smw.ch Page 5 of 9

considered in order to maintain a haemoglobin level
between 11 to 13 g/dl.
Recommendation class I, level of evidence C.
Recommendations for the treatment of diabetes after
HTx
1. Prevention, early detection, and appropriate therapy for
diabetes should be considered as an important
component of patient care after HTx.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
2. Regular screening for diabetes after HTx is
recommended by measuring fasting blood glucose
levels and/or HbA1c, as appropriate.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
3. Therapies for short-term peri-operative and long-term
glycaemic control should be based on respective
international recommendations.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
4. CNI-sparing or CNI-free regimens should be used as
appropriate.
Recommendation class I, level of evidence C.
5. Annual screening for diabetic complications should be
performed (ophthalmology, podiatry, peripheral
vascular disease, and others).
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
Malignancy after HTx
The risk of malignancy in solid organ transplant recipients
is increased when compared to the general population. This
is believed to be a result of long-term immunosuppression
comprising the patient’s immune system. Skin cancer is the
most prevalent malignancy in HTx recipients with an incid￾ence of 1% at 1 year, 10% at 5 years, 20% at 10 years, and
29% at 14 years [1]. Lymphoproliferative malignancies are
much less common and available treatments are much less
likely to result in a cure. The incidence of lymphoprolifer￾ative malignancy is 1%, 2%, 4%, 5% at 1, 5, 10, and 14
years post-transplant [1]. A recent study suggests a protect￾ive effect of statin treatment [38].
1. Recommendations for screening for colon, breast, and
prostate cancer in the general population should be
followed in HTx recipients.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C
2. Close skin cancer surveillance with at least annual
dermatologic exam.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
3. Initial evaluation and a therapeutic plan for treatment of
malignancy should be done by physicians familiar
with transplant-associated malignancies.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
Prophylaxis of corticosteroid-induced bone disease
Bisphosphonates suppress bone re-absorption, however, it
is not known whether pre-operative administration of these
drugs can prevent bone loss developing with the introduc￾tion of corticosteroids after HTx. Furthermore, the predict￾ive value of bone mass density (BMD) measurement for
fracture risk remains unproven in HTx recipients. Several
studies describe a beneficial effect of bisphosphonates and
vitamin D analogues on bone density in HTx recipients.
Nevertheless, none of these studies was powered to detect
a decrease in fracture rate.
1. Adult HTx candidates should be screened for pre￾existing bone disease, preferably at the time of
placement on the waiting list.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
2. All HTx candidates should have the recommended daily
allowance for 1000 to 1500 mg calcium depending on
age and menopausal status, and vitamin D (500–1000
IU or as necessary to maintain serum 25–OH vitamin
D level >30 ng/ml).
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
3. All adult HTx patients should begin therapy with
bisphosphonates early after HTx and continue it at
least during the first postoperative year.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence B.
4. Bisphosphonates can be used to treat bone-loss in the
long-term after HTx and should be used in addition to
calcium and vitamin D.
Recommendation Class I, level of evidence C.
5. Proximal femur and lumbar spine BMD should be
assessed by DEXA scanning in all adult patients at 1
year after HTx. Thereafter, annual controls are wise in
patients receiving long-term treatment with
bisphosphonates or corticosteroids. It is reasonable to
repeat BMD measurement every 2 years in patients
with osteopenia and every 3 years in patients with
normal bone density.
Recommendation Class IIa, level of evidence C.
In summary, posttransplant complications such as chronic
kidney disease, hypertension, and hyperglycaemia need
non-immunological strategies. Individualisation of immun￾osuppressive therapy may help to minimise non-immun￾ologic adverse events, however, they should not risk the
beneficial effect of immunological treatment on long-term
outcomes. Clinical studies are necessary to provide
evidence-based non-immunological treatment strategies
after HTx.
Monitoring of immunosuppression
The goal of HTx management includes prevention of acute
cellular and antibody-mediated rejection, cardiac allograft
vasculopathy, and optimal preservation of the integrity and
function of the donor organ. The standard current
posttransplantation protocol for detection of allograft rejec￾tion consists of echocardiographic control in conjunction
with endomyocardial biopsy procurement (EMB). EMB
is invasive, uncomfortable, and associated with potential
damage to the tricuspid valve. In addition, sampling error
limits the sensitivity of the EMB to 70% [39] while speci￾ficity suffers from interobserver variation in the histologic￾al interpretation even when performed by most experienced
pathologists.
The FDA has recently approved two biomarker-based dia￾gnostic blood tests monitoring acute rejection after HTx.

the measurement of intracellular ATP that depends on T￾cell activation, hypothesising that the activation status of T￾cells identify patients at high risk for rejection or at high
risk due to over- or under-immunosuppression [39]. The

AlloMap blood test (AlloMap, XDx®) applies a mathem￾atical algorithm for detection of acute cellular rejection on
the basis of the expression of a panel of eleven different
genes [40]. Both tests permit detection of acute cellular re￾jection with a high negative predictive value, however, de￾tection of acute rejection should be achieved using a meth￾od with a high positive predictive value.
Recently it has been shown that cardiac magnetic reson￾ance (CMR) imaging may provide a non-invasive method
for detection of acute rejection with a high positive pre￾dictive value. Hallmark of CMR imaging is its ability to
reproduce quantitative measurement of cardiac size and
function, as well as myocardial ischaemia, fibrosis, and ed￾ema. Acute rejection is a host cell mediated reaction to
donor antigens resulting in local inflammation and oedema
[42]. Measurement of the T2
relaxation time permits quan￾tification of interstitial free water because of an increase
of the length of the decay time constant of the respect￾ive MR signal which is in proportion to the magnitude of
myocardial oedema [for detailed explanations see 43 and
ref. there]. More recently, translation of promising results
from animal research into the human was obtained using
latest 3T MRI technology in combination with a new soft￾ware algorithm [44]. This novel technology achieves real
time acquisition of T2
relaxation time and allows for three￾dimensional mapping of the left ventricle with detection of
interstitial edema at small scale volume (signal volume of
1.7 μl). This suggests that T2 mapping should be able to
detect mild acute rejection with high sensitivity and speci￾ficity. The applicability of this method in the clinical set￾ting is actually under investigation (Swiss National Fund
