Abstract. Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is a rare 
malignant tumor entity compared to common clear cell renal 
carcinoma. In the present study, we report a patient who was 
diagnosed with PRCC twice and successfully treated each time 
following renal transplantation. The first PRCC was located 
in the left native kidney two years following transplantation, 
and the second PRCC was diagnosed in the allograft 13 years 
following transplantation. The two tumors were completely 
removed by surgery in stage I of the disease with sufficient 
conservation of the allograft function. Notably, the tumors had 
a different origin as indicated by the microsatellite analysis, 
which reflects the exceptional course of the case. Risk factors 
for PRCC were identified in our patient. We concluded that 
high-risk candidates for malignancies in renal transplant recipi￾ents should receive shorter ultrasonic screening intervals, which 
may facilitate early tumor detection and improve outcome rates.
Case report
A 55-year old Caucasian male was admitted to the University 
Hospital Münster, Germany, due to a solid mass in the renal 
allograft observed by routine ultrasonography. The patient had 
a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m² and a tobacco consump￾tion of 30 pack-years. Informed consent for this case report 
was obtained from the patient. The study was approved by the 
local ethics committee.
Examination of the patient's medical history revealed 
Goodpasture syndrome that had led to end-stage kidney 
disease 27 years before. Following 14 years of hemodialysis, 
the patient received a cadaveric renal transplantation, and 
immunosuppression was started with a triple combination 
of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. Two 
years after transplantation, a solid tumor was incidentally 
detected in the left native kidney using routine ultrasound. A 
native computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a well‑defined, 
heterogeneous large mass (5.8x5.0 cm) originating from the 
upper pole (Fig. 1A). Due to a suspected renal malignancy, 
a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy of the left native kidney 
was performed. Macroscopic inspection of the explanted 
organ revealed acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) and a 
5.5x4.5x4.0 cm large tumor surrounded by a pseudocapsule, 
which revealed typical characteristics of a low-grade chro￾mophilic PRCC upon histopathological evaluation (Fig. 1B). 
The tumor was limited to the kidney parenchyma, and immu￾nohistochemistry indicated positivity for α-methylacyl-CoA 
racemase (AMACR), a highly sensitive diagnostic marker of 
PRCC (1). There was no evidence of metastatic disease detect￾able by whole-body CT. Furthermore, the function of the renal 
graft remained satisfactory with a serum creatinine level of 
1.5 mg/dl.
A total of 13 years following transplantation, another suspi￾cious inhomogeneous lesion (5.4x5.7x6.1 cm) was detected at 
the upper pole of the allograft by routine ultrasonography and 
was confirmed by magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) 
imaging (Fig. 2A). Due to the excellent physical condition 
of the patient and a well-functioning allograft, an organ￾preserving enucleation technique was selected. The tumor was 
excised from the kidney by nephron-sparing surgery (NSS). 
Notably, histolopathological examination again revealed the 
rare diagnosis of a low-grade PRCC with no invasion of the 
pseudocapsule. The cutting edges were free of the tumor and 
histological analysis demonstrated papillary proliferating 
atypical epithelial cells positive for AMACR (Fig. 2B).

revealed a well-defined, heterogeneous large mass (5.8x5.0 cm) at the upper pole of the left native kidney (arrow); the right kidney demonstrated considerable 
shrinkage with cysts, typical for ACKD. (B) Histological findings of the first PRCC are shown. The left panel shows the initial low-grade chromophilic PRCC 
of the left native kidney (H&E; original magnification, x40); the right panel shows the respective immunohistochemistry with positivity for α-methylacyl-CoA

A postoperative whole body CT scan and scintigraphy of 
the skeletal system revealed no signs of metastasis. The graft 
remained persistent and well-functioning, and tacrolimus 
was replaced by everolimus to decrease the potential risk 
of further tumor development. To confirm the origin of the 
PRCCs, a DNA microsatellite analysis was performed with 
samples derived from the two kidney tumors. Notably, PCR 
amplification revealed different patterns in 5 of 7 regions in 
the microsatellite analysis, which reflects the different origin 
of the two tumors.
Discussion
The overall prevalence of post-transplantation malignancy is 
significantly increased following renal transplantation (2,3). 
A total of 5% of all malignancies are kidney tumors; twice 
the amount of that in the general population (4). Kidney trans￾plant recipients carry a 15-fold risk of renal cell carcinoma 
following transplantation (5,6). Notably, among these approxi￾mately 40% of all renal cell carcinoma are PRCC compared to 
a prevalence of only 10-15% in the general population (7-9).
The present case report demonstrates two relevant features. 
Firstly, the incidence of two PRCCs of different origins in 
one patient (one PRCC in the native kidney and one in the 
allograft), which to the best of our knowledge, has not been 
previously reported. Secondly, short ultrasonography control 
intervals in a high-risk patient enable early tumor detection 
and successful therapy. This demonstrates an enormous 
clinical relevance.
As PRCC is a rare malignant tumor entity, the occurrence 
of two PRCCs in the same patient following renal transplan￾tation appears to be an uncommon coincidence. There are 
several well-known risk factors for the development of renal 
cell carcinoma, including smoking, obesity, abuse of anal￾gesics and ACKD (10). Furthermore, prolonged high-dose 
immunosuppression following renal transplantation leads to a 
higher incidence of malignancies (3).
A number of risk factors may have contributed to PRCC 
development in the patient. Thirteen years of triple immu￾nosuppressive therapy, obesity with a BMI of 35 kg/m2
, 
ACKD and 30 pack‑years tobacco consumption identified 
our patient as a high-risk candidate for renal malignancies. 
Therefore, routine ultrasonography screening examinations 
for malignancies within the native kidney and the allograft are 
necessary. Although de novo carcinomas in the renal allograft 
are extremely rare, certain cases of carcinomas detected in 
the graft have been reported (11,12). Long follow‑up periods 
should be recommended as malignancies can occur even 
decades following transplantation.
Early tumor diagnosis is essential for a good outcome. In 
our patient, a diagnosis at stage I of the disease enabled an 
organ-preserving surgery with a persistent well-functioning 
graft. In comparison to radical nephrectomy, NSS has become 
a safe treatment method for low-stage renal cell carcinomas 
and enables the preservation of organ function (13,14).
In conclusion, this case demonstrates the relevance of 
risk factors in the development of PRCC. This strengthens 
the requirement for a risk adaptive screening strategy for 
malignancies in the allograft and native kidneys. For high‑risk 
candidates, shorter ultrasonic screening intervals may facilitate 
early tumor detection and enhance the chance for successful 
NSS and better outcome rates.
