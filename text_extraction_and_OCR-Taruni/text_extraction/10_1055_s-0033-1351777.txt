Preoperative Assessment
Evaluation of the Required Extent of Liver Resection
Most hepatic resections are performed as treatment for
either primary liver tumors or metastasis secondary to
extrahepatic tumors. These resections need to have a
sufficient margin in order to be curative; therefore, the
precise location of the tumor is necessary prior to surgery.
It is further mandatory to estimate the remaining liver size
to avoid insufficient functional reserve of the liver remnant
after resection. Estimation of the remaining liver function
after resection can be complicated by baseline liver disease
such as cirrhosis. Hepatic cirrhosis not only decreases the
functional reserve of the remaining liver, but also renders is
succinctly sensitive to ischemic injury. Preoperative esti￾mation of remaining liver size is the first step in creating a
surgical plan for extensive hepatic resections of five or
more segments in all patients with and without hepatic
cirrhosis.

Abstract Liver resection in patients with underlying liver disease remains a formidable challenge.
It requires adequate patient selection, a precise surgical plan, and avoidance of
additional ischemic insults during surgery. Precise estimation of the residual liver
volume using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and computer￾assisted volumetry allows the calculation of residual to total liver volume (RLV/TLV)
ratios. Although RLV/TLV ratios over 20 to 25% are considered sufficient in healthy livers,
patients with cirrhosis may only tolerate resections that result in RLV/TLV ratios over 40%
and higher. Conventional laboratory tests may not be able to sufficiently predict liver
reserve after resection. Dynamic tests such as indocyanine green clearance have been
used to assess residual liver function and assist in deciding about operability of patients
with underlying liver disease undergoing extensive resections. Intraoperative manage￾ment should focus on avoiding blood loss and ischemic injury to the liver. Low central
venous pressure may reduce blood loss and is recommended if tolerated without
impeding renal perfusion. Portal vein and hepatic artery occlusion during resection can
reduce blood loss, but will cause ischemic insult to the liver that may jeopardize residual
liver function and induce postoperative hepatic failure. When feasible, vascular occlu￾sion should be avoided in patients with underlying liver disease. The postoperative
recovery is usually fast if sufficient liver remains. However, vigilance is required to detect
liver dysfunction and treat its complications.

Preoperative Assessment of Residual Hepatic Function
Estimation of Residual Liver Volume
Dual-phase computed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso￾nance imaging (MRI) are the radiologic techniques of choice
to assess tumor location and size. The aim is to evaluate if a
curative resection is possible with an acceptable low risk of
postoperative liver failure. Computer-assisted volumetry of
the entire liver and the liver remnant after “virtual resection”
allow the calculation of either the ratio of remnant liver
volume to total liver volume (RLV/TLV ratio) or the ratio of
remnant liver to body volume (RLV/BW ratio). Radiologic
assessment of liver size is preferable over formulas that
estimate liver size. There is good general correlation between
estimated and measured liver size,1 but in individual cases
estimation of liver size may be erroneous depending on liver
size.2
There is no consensus if RLV/BW or RLV/TLV ratios have a
better ability to predict postoperative liver failure. Tradition￾ally a RLV/TLV ratio above 20 to 25% is considered acceptable
for tumor resections. The margin of safety needs to be much
higher for living liver donation than for therapeutic liver
resections. For living liver donation, conventionally RLV/BW
ratios are used and a ratio > 0.6 is considered safe to avoid
postoperative small for size syndrome.3 RLV/BW ratios are
now also used for liver resections. Truant et al reported in
2004 that resections of more than 80% of the total liver
volume did not increase the 3-month morbidity; however,
patients who had less than 0.5% RLV/BW ratio had a signifi￾cantly higher incidence of complications and mortality.4
This was a small retrospective study of only 31 patients;
more recent studies have found a close correlation between
RLV/BW and RLV/TLV ratios. Chun et al reported that a RLV/
BW ratio of  0.4 or a RLV/TLV ratio of  20% is a safe threshold
to prevent postoperative liver failure in noncirrhotic
patients.5
Patients whose disease is more extensive may benefit from
preoperative chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation
to shrink the tumor(s), staged surgery for multilobar lesions,
or preoperative portal vein embolization to increase the
volume of the future liver remnant to achieve safe resection
of otherwise unresectable tumors.6
Assessment of Operative Candidacy of Patients with
Hepatic Cirrhosis
Hepatic cirrhosis renders the liver disproportionally sensitive
to ischemic injury and even short episodes of ischemia￾reperfusion may cause profound dysfunction of the remnant
liver.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is common with hepatic
cirrhosis and is a frequent cause of mortality. Resection can
improve survival and should be performed if it can be done
safely, especially if the patient is not considered a transplant
candidate. Staging of HCC should include the American Joint
Committee on Cancer / International Union for Cancer Control
definitions.
Large tumor size is not a contraindication for resection and
the ability to perform a safe resection depends on the size of
the liver remnant and the ability to perform the resection
without vascular occlusion techniques. There is no consensus
of what are considered safe RLV/BW and RLV/TLV ratios;
however, a RLV/TLV ratio < 40% is generally considered a
very high risk for postoperative liver failure in cirrhotic
patients.7 Patients with severe liver disease (Child C) are
usually not considered candidates for liver resection at all.
Patients with Child B cirrhosis will not tolerate major resec￾tions with a RLV/TLV ratio < 30%. The mortality of patients
with Child A cirrhosis after liver resection has been reported
to be 14% compared with 1% in patients without cirrhosis.8
Multiple studies have demonstrated that the Model of End￾stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a good predictor of
postoperative complications such as acute liver failure and
mortality after hepatic resections.9–11 These studies indicate
that patients with a MELD score > 9 are at a substantial risk
for postoperative complications and mortality and (exten￾sive) resection should probably be avoided. Interestingly, the
MELD score has not been useful in predicting morbidity or
mortality risk after liver resection in patients without
cirrhosis.12
Static laboratory tests may not be able to fully appreciate
the ability of the liver to prevail despite reduction in size and
ischemic injury associated with liver resections. As I will
discuss later in this article, conventional laboratory tests are
too insensitive to detect anything but severe restrictions in
liver function. “Liver reserve” may be better assessed using
dynamic liver function tests that are described in more detail
below. Indocyanine green (ICG) clearance has been recog￾nized as a useful test to assess the risk of liver resections for
many years now. For example, Hummings et al. measured ICG
clearance in 22 patients undergoing liver resection in 1992.
Preoperative ICG clearance was the best predictor of mortali￾ty, better than any other liver laboratory test.13 Multiple
newer studies also confirmed the utility of ICG clearance as
a risk assessment tool.14–16 This has led to the development of
an algorithm that includes total serum bilirubin levels as well
as results from preoperative ICG clearance to aid in the
decision about the extent of resection in patients with hepatic
cirrhosis.14
Other dynamic function tests, for example, the monoe￾thylglycinexylidide (MEGX-) test17 or hippurate ratio,18 have
also been tested as risk-stratification tools for hepatic resec￾tions with similar good results. We will describe these in
more detail below.
Algorithms that include conventional and dynamic liver
function tests can only guide decision making and are not
intended to replace clinical decisions by experienced practi￾tioners. Major resections even with total vascular occlusion
are possible in patients with mild cirrhosis in the hands of
experienced surgeons, hepatologists, and anesthesiologists.19
Evaluation of Liver Function
Conventional Liver Function Tests
Conventional liver function tests can be divided into tests that
reflect liver function and those reflecting liver injury. Liver
function can be further divided into metabolic and synthetic

function. Metabolic function comprises pathways that in￾clude enzymes of the cytochrome family (phase I) and
glucuronidation pathways (phase II). Conventional liver func￾tion tests, such as the measurement of total bilirubin, reflect
phase II metabolism. However, phase II metabolism is rather
robust and insensitive to ischemic injury. Therefore, total
bilirubin levels may overestimate the functional reserve of
the liver and remain normal even when phase I metabolism is
already substantially impaired. As a consequence, the early
stages of liver dysfunction are often underdiagnosed when
only phase II metabolism (e.g., total bilirubin) is taken into
account.
The main synthetic functions that are commonly assessed
with laboratory tests are protein synthesis and synthesis of
coagulation factors. Impaired protein synthesis affects albu￾min concentrations and is therefore included in the Child￾Turcotte score. However, albumin levels are rarely specific
and sensitive enough to detect minor and intermediate
compromised function. Fluid retention and protein loss
with ascites may further decrease albumin levels; therefore,
these may be not proportional to the decrease in synthetic
function only.
Impaired synthesis of coagulation factors may result in an
abnormal coagulation test, such as an increase of the inter￾national normalized ratio (INR). But liver disease affects not
only the synthesis of procoagulant factors, but also anticoag￾ulant factors such as protein C or protein S. The balance of pro￾and anticoagulant factors may therefore be preserved (but
much less stable) or tipped toward hypercoagulability even
when the INR is substantially increased.
Transaminases reflect hepatic injury; they are intracellular
and intramitochondrial enzymes that are released when cell
death occurs. Transaminases may reflect the degree of injury,
but not necessarily impairment of function. Transaminases
only increase with acute injury, but not with chronic disease;
therefore, they are similar to troponin I in the presence of
myocardial dysfunction. They are useful to detect acute organ
injury, but not impairments of function.
These limitations of conventional liver function tests com￾promise their utility to assess hepatic reserve prior to liver
resection. Conventional liver function becomes pathologic
only late during disease progression. Therefore, patients
usually do not tolerate any resections and prolonged hepatic
ischemia when conventional tests are increased and other,
more sensitive liver function tests may be better suited to
evaluate preoperative hepatic reserve.
Dynamic Liver Function Tests
Dynamic liver function tests directly measure hepatic metab￾olism, usually of phase I oxidative pathways. These pathways
are more sensitive to ischemia than phase II glucuronidation
and will be abnormal even with mild forms of liver disease.
Hence, these tests are more sensitive to detect even minor
impairments of liver function. Dynamic liver function tests
have the further advantage of assessing the metabolic reserve
at the time of measurement, instead of relying on metabolites
that may have accumulated and therefore allow a real-time
assessment of function. ►Fig. 1 depicts different static and
dynamic liver function tests. This review will be limited to the
most commonly studied tests, indocyanine green clearance,
the monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) test, and sorbitol
clearance.
Indocyanine Green Clearance
Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye that if given
intravenously is eliminated through the bile within a few

minutes in healthy subjects and does not undergo enter￾ohepatic recirculation. Elimination (700 mL/min/m2
) is de￾pendent on hepatocyte function, liver blood flow, and intact
bile secretion and can be expressed by the percentage of ICG
eliminated per minute (ICG plasma disappearance rate [ICG￾PDR]). Normal ICG-PDR is over 18% / min and is usually
measured over 15 minutes after injection of ICG. Indocyanine
green absorbs infrared light at a frequency close to the
absorption spectrum of deoxygenated blood; oxygen satura￾tion measured by pulse oximetry decreases falsely for mi￾nutes after an intravenous bolus of ICG. A transcutaneous
sensor similar to a conventional pulse oximeter, but with an
infrared light source at the absorption spectrum of ICG (805
and 940 nm) may be used for noninvasive transcutaneous ICG
clearance and has correlated very well with sequential plas￾ma measurements of ICG.20 Multiple studies confirmed the
ability of ICG clearance to predict liver failure after hepatic
resection. Hemming et al found that ICG-PDR was the best
predictor of 30-day mortality after liver resection and an ICG￾PDR.13
Furthermore, indocyanine green is a good predictor of
graft loss or death within 30 days after liver transplantation.21
An ICG-PDR < 9.8% on day 7 predicted graft loss or death with
a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 72.6%. As ICG-PDR
depends on hepatic blood flow it has also been used to detect
vascular complications during liver transplantation. Renn et
al reported a case of portal vein and hepatic artery occlusion
after liver transplantation that was only detected by a sudden
decrease in ICG-PDR. Mandell et al22 describe a similar case in
which a decrease of ICG-PDR led to the diagnosis of portal
vein occlusion and allowed a rapid surgical correction and full
recovery of graft function.
Indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate is also an
excellent predictor of outcome and survival in intensive care
unit (ICU) patients or patients with sepsis23 an ICG-PDR < 8%
is associated with a very high mortality. Surprisingly, ICG-PDR
in this general ICU population was a better predictor of
mortality than complex scoring systems such as the APACHE
II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) or SAPS
II (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) scores.
Indocyanine green clearance is affected by biliary obstruc￾tion and can overestimate hepatic dysfunction when chole￾stasis is present. Indocyanine green has very few adverse
effects, but should be avoided in patients with iodine aller￾gies. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administra￾tion to measure liver function, but the noninvasive,
transcutaneous measurement of ICG clearance (LIMON, Pul￾sion Medical Systems AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) has not been
approved.
Monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) Test
Lidocaine is an amide local anesthetic that has a high hepatic
extraction ratio (0.53) and is then rapidly metabolized by the
cytochrome P450 system through oxidative N-dealkylation.
Its main metabolite is monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) can
be easily measured in the plasma. Plasma MEGX levels can be
determined before and then 15 and 30 minutes after a bolus
injection of intravenous lidocaine. The rate of lidocaine
metabolism depends on hepatic blood flow and the activity
of the cytochrome P-450 system, specifically the CYP 3A4 and
CYP 1A2 isoenzymes.24,25 Erythromycin and ketoconazole
inhibit the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme and can therefore affect the
MEGX test adversely. Oxidative phase I metabolism by cyto￾chrome P450 is more sensitive to ischemic insults than phase
II glucuronidation and is therefore better suited to assess
hepatic reserve. The MEGX is a good predictor of survival in
patients with liver disease.26–28 Other studies have success￾fully used the MEGX test to assess cadaveric liver donor
quality29,30 or posttransplant graft function.31
Similar to ICG clearance, MEGX measurements are also
highly predictive of survival in general ICU populations. On
day 4 after ICU admission, median MEGX levels were signifi￾cantly lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors (23 μg/L vs. 53
μg/L, p < 0.01).32 These results emphasize that hepatic dys￾function is much more common in critically ill patients and
not readily detected with conventional liver function tests
such as total bilirubin measurements. Despite this, MEGX
testing is not routinely used in clinical practice.
Sorbitol Clearance
D-sorbitol is a nontoxic sugar with a very high hepatic
extraction ratio (0.93) and is rapidly metabolized by the
fructose pathway in the liver.33 Because of the high hepatic
extraction of D-sorbitol, its elimination correlates well with
hepatic blood flow. In hepatic cirrhosis, total hepatic blood
flow is not necessarily decreased, but the amount of effective
blood flow, i.e., the fraction of total blood flow that gets in
contact with hepatic sinusoids declines. A larger proportion
of blood bypasses constricted sinusoids through trans- and
extrahepatic shunts; therefore, it does not participate in the
hepatic metabolism.34
D-sorbitol elimination (and to some degree ICG clearance)
is therefore likely a reflection of “functional” blood flow and
not total hepatic blood flow. D-sorbitol has a higher extraction
ratio than ICG (0.93 and 0.58, respectively) and is therefore
less dependent on metabolic reserve of the liver and may
more accurately estimate functional liver flow. There are few
human studies of D-sorbitol elimination; more research is
required to assess its clinical utility for liver resection and
transplantation.
Preoperative Risk Assessment for Nonhepatic Disease
Cardiac and Coronary Disease
The most commonly used algorithm to aid in the decision
about preoperative cardiac testing are the guidelines of the
American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association
on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and care for non￾cardiac surgery (revised in 2007).35 This algorithm considers
any intraperitoneal surgery (which includes major hepatic
resections) as intermediate risk surgery (only vascular sur￾gery is considered high risk). Patients with poor (< 4 meta￾bolic equivalents of task [METs]) or unknown functional
capacity who have three or more clinical risk factors for
cardiac events should undergo noninvasive testing for cardiac
disease. Patients with 1 to 2 clinical risk factors can

undergo noninvasive testing for cardiac disease especially if
this may change the perioperative management. Clinical risk
factors include a history of ischemic heart disease, compen￾sated or prior heart failure or cerebrovascular disease, diabe￾tes mellitus, or renal insufficiency.
Patients with active cardiac conditions such as unstable
coronary syndromes, decompensated heart failure (New York
Heart Association [NYHA] functional class IV, worsening or
new-onset heart failure), significant arrhythmias, or severe
valvular disease should undergo testing prior to surgery in all
cases except emergencies independent of ability to exercise.
The use of this algorithm may not be feasible when
patients have rapidly growing or large tumors. Stress test,
coronary angiography, and possible intervention either by
percutaneous intervention or coronary bypass grafting may
take too long and cause the tumor to be unresectable, hence
taking away the patient’s chance for cure. In these cases,
surgery should proceed as long as the patient fully under￾stands the increased risk for cardiac events and agrees with
this plan.
Multiple other risk-assessment tools have been developed.
The Revised Cardiac Risk Index36 is probably the most widely
used tool that is simple and easily applied with few questions.
One point each is given for high-risk surgery (including
intraperitoneal), a history of ischemic heart disease, conges￾tive heart failure or cerebrovascular disease, preoperative
treatment with insulin, or preoperative serum creatinine
> 2.0 mg/dL.
The risk of major cardiac events increases with an increas￾ing number of risk factors and is 0.4% for 0, 0.9% for 1, 6.6% for
2, and 11% for 3 or more points. This simple score has good
predictive power, but has not been validated for patients
undergoing hepatectomies.
Intraoperative Management
Anesthetic Management and Monitoring and Low
Central Venous Pressure Technique
General endotracheal anesthesia is commonly required for
hepatectomies.
(Radial) arterial catheters should be placed routinely to
allow beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring and facilitate
frequent blood draws. Major (but not necessarily minor)
resections will also require placement of a central venous
catheter that allows monitoring of central venous pressure
(CVP), large volume fluid administration, and central admin￾istration of vasoactive drugs.
Central venous pressure is not an adequate representation
of volume status and responsiveness. Multiple studies start￾ing with Shoemaker’s study of intravascular volume and CVP
30 years ago37 have demonstrated that there is no relation￾ship between CVP and intravascular volume. Central venous
pressure also does not predict which patients respond to a
volume challenge favorably (i.e., with an increased blood
pressure).38
However, during liver resections CVP monitoring may be
helpful. Central venous pressure correlates with hepatic vein
pressure; therefore, intraparenchymal pressure will increase
with increased CVP. Many studies have demonstrated that
low CVP (< 5 mm Hg) is associated with decreased blood
loss39–41 and perhaps even improved morbidity and mortali￾ty.42 These results have been criticized by some practitioners;
two studies found no association between CVP and blood loss
during living liver donation. Low CVP is not without risk; for
example, low renal perfusion may exacerbate pre-existing
renal insufficiency and cause acute kidney injury. This is
particularly of concern if the patient has underlying hepatic
cirrhosis and is dependent on a hyperdynamic state and high
cardiac output to maintain (renal) perfusion pressure. Low
CVP technique may furthermore affect beneficial hepatic
artery flow and oxygen delivery to the liver.
In patients with no renal dysfunction and normal liver
function, the low CVP technique is recommended. Reduction
in blood loss and avoidance of blood transfusion facilitates
resection and is likely going to improve outcome.43 Adequate
fluid resuscitation after the specimen was removed should
avoid any adverse sequelae in most cases. Frequently, vaso￾pressors are temporarily required to maintain perfusion
pressure when using the low CVP technique.
Low CVP technique is not indicated if total hepatic occlu￾sion is required. Occlusion of the suprahepatic inferior vena
cava (IVC) substantially decreases cardiac preload, which is
not tolerated if the patient is hypovolemic. Inferior vena cava
clamping will require an adequate volume status in addition
to vasopressor administration.
Surgical and Anesthetic Techniques to Preserve Liver
Function
Frequently, major liver resections will require vascular occlu￾sion to reduce blood loss and optimize the surgical field.
Vascular inflow occlusion is often achieved by slinging an
umbilical tape around the porta hepatis and then tightening
it. This technique is called the Pringle maneuver and disrupts
portal venous and hepatic arterial blood flow to the liver. The
Pringle maneuver causes ischemic injury to the liver and can
therefore only be applied for a limited time. This is particu￾larly important if the liver has underlying disease such as
hepatic cirrhosis. Cirrhotic livers are extraordinarily sensitive
to ischemic injury. Application of the Pringle maneuver in
cirrhotic patients causes significantly higher postoperative
elevations of conventional liver function tests compared with
noncirrhotic patients.44 If possible, the Pringle maneuver
should be avoided or its duration minimized in patients
with hepatic cirrhosis.
Cholestatic livers are similarly sensitive to ischemic insults
as cirrhotic livers. Reversible causes of cholestatic disease
should be treated prior to major liver resections.45 Stenting
and drainage of extrahepatic biliary obstructions and then
delay of surgery until resolution of cholestasis can greatly
reduce the risk of postoperative liver failure.46
Earlier studies in animals47 and humans48,49 using ische￾mic preconditioning to ameliorate hepatic injury had been
quite promising. For example, Clavien et al randomized 100
patients to 10 minutes of hepatic ischemia followed by 10
minutes reperfusion or no ischemic preconditioning. All
patients then underwent major hepatic resection with at
Seminars in Liver Disease Vol. 33 No. 3/2013

least 30-minute ischemic time. The authors found that pa￾tients who had undergone ischemic preconditioning had
lower postoperative transaminase levels. This beneficial ef￾fect was particularly noticeable in young patients. However, a
more recent meta-analysis found a similar decrease in trans￾aminase levels, but no improvement of mortality, liver func￾tion, or other morbidity between the groups.50 These results
were lately confirmed for patients undergoing liver resection
with total vascular exclusion (TVE). Jeon et al found no
difference in outcome or laboratory markers in patients
who received ischemic preconditioning when undergoing
major liver resection with TVE compared with patients
without ischemic preconditioning.51 Due to this absence of
convincing evidence, we cannot recommend the routine use
of ischemic preconditioning.
Selective vascular inflow occlusion may be used by occlud￾ing only the right or left branches of the portal vein and
hepatic artery. This technique will require a more complex
dissection of the porta hepatis, but results in decreased injury
to the remaining lobe of the liver and may be a very suitable
technique to avoid ischemic injury in patients with preexist￾ing liver dysfunction and cirrhosis.
Total vascular exclusion comprises temporary occlusion
of the porta hepatis (e.g., using the Pringle maneuver) and
clamping of the IVC both above and below the liver. This
results in substantial reduction of right ventricular preload
and is usually not tolerated when a low CVP technique is
used. Fluid loading prior to IVC clamping is mandatory;
additional vasopressors are often required to maintain
blood pressure. This is particularly true in patients with
underlying liver disease who need a hyperdynamic circu￾lation to compensate for low systemic vascular resistance.
Close communication about the surgical plan between the
anesthesiologist and surgeon is essential to avoid poten￾tially catastrophic events.
Postoperative Management
Routine Postoperative Management
The perioperative mortality for patients undergoing hepatic
resections has vastly improved over the last few decades, and
now is 5% or less in high volume centers. The most important
factors affecting perioperative mortality are blood loss, the
amount of liver resected, and the functional reserve of the
remaining liver. 52 Consideration to these factors during the
surgery is essential to guide postoperative management and
to achieve favorable outcomes.
In the absence of underlying hepatic dysfunction or signif￾icant comorbidities, patients undergoing simple partial hep￾atectomy may be safely managed in a stepdown unit during
the first postoperative day. Because patients with baseline
hepatic dysfunction are at increased risk of complications in
the immediate postoperative period, we recommend ICU￾level care, invasive blood pressure monitoring, and a urinary
catheter to measure urine output. Continuous blood pressure
monitoring with a radial arterial line is standard, and routine
use of a femoral arterial line is usually not required unless an
extensive hepatic resection with total vascular exclusion is
expected. Total vascular occlusion, including clamping of the
vena cava, causes profound hypotension requiring high-dose
vasopressors. This may dampen the tracing of the radial
artery catheter; in this situation, a femoral arterial line will
continue to provide reliable arterial blood pressure data.
Central line access is usually recommended for major
resections to allow rapid administration of fluid, blood, and
vasoactive drugs if necessary.
Most patients will not require postoperative ventilatory
support; if the patient arrives intubated in the ICU, extubation
can proceed rapidly as long as there are no major complica￾tions. Large fluid and transfusion requirements, bleeding, and
hemodynamic instability may preclude extubation. The pa￾tients may require longer ventilatory support if the develop￾ment of liver failure due to a small liver remnant is suspected.
Liver failure will result in decreased lactate metabolism and
metabolic acidosis that will require the patient to hyperven￾tilate to maintain a normal pH. It will be safer to support the
patient with a ventilator during this time to avoid exhaustion
until the metabolic acidosis is resolving.
Fluids and Electrolytes
Patients with cirrhosis have high circulating blood volume
requirements and after large abdominal surgery are suscep￾tible to fluid shifts, reaccumulation of ascites, and episodes of
hypotension. Colloid fluid administration is effective for bolus
resuscitation to rapidly restore intravascular volume. Hypo￾tension refractory to fluid administration should be treated
with vasopressors (norepinephrine  vasopressin) and the
cause for hypotension needs to be swiftly investigated.
Hypovolemia due to underresuscitation or bleeding are com￾mon and may be exaggerated with underlying cirrhotic
vasodilation.
An understanding of the intraoperative events, estimated
blood loss, and total fluid volume given including blood
products will help guide the initial management. Close
observation should be paid to achieve adequate end organ
perfusion with a goal urine output of > 0.5 mL/kg/h.
Acute kidney injury is common after major hepatic resec￾tion with a reported incidence of up to 15%.53 In patients with
hepatic cirrhosis, acute kidney injury is often confounded by
prerenal azotemia and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Hepa￾torenal syndrome occurs with advanced cirrhosis and results
from peripheral and splanchnic vasodilation, leading to de￾creased renal perfusion, increased sodium reabsorption, and
total body volume overload. Inadequate resuscitation and
infection predispose to HRS; albumin and vasopressors ad￾ministration and antibiotics may facilitate clinical
improvement.54
Drains placed in the abdomen should be observed for signs
of hemorrhage or bile leak. The character of the fluid draining
should be corroborated with the patient’s clinical picture,
keeping in mind that drains may have shifted or clogged. The
absence of significant drainage does not rule out the presence
of bleeding or bile leak. Bile leaks are common and may occur
in up to 20% of hepatectomies.
As fluid shifts between vascular compartments, occasion￾ally the judicious use of diuretics can help prevent volume

overload beyond postoperative day 2; though care should be
taken to assess the patient’s complete clinical picture. Over￾diuresis and low circulating intravascular volume can have
profound consequences as mentioned above.
Diligent replacement of electrolytes is prudent because
nearly all posthepatectomy patients will have some degree of
electrolyte abnormalities in the postoperative period. Hypo￾phosphatemia occurs frequently and aggressive repletion is
appropriate to prevent deficient energy metabolism mani￾festing as cardiac or respiratory dysfunction.55
Postoperative Hepatic Function
The risk of postoperative hepatic dysfunction in patients with
normal underlying liver parenchyma is low as long as suffi￾cient hepatic volume remains. After major resections vigi￾lance and close postoperative monitoring of liver function is
essential to identify patients at risk for liver failure. Initial
laboratory studies should include a complete blood count,
basic metabolic panel, INR, partial thromboplastin time
(PTT), hepatic function tests, and lactate level. The INR and
lactate levels should be measured frequently; these are the
fastest and most sensitive and specific of conventional labo￾ratory markers. Transaminases will initially increase from
intraoperative hepatic manipulation, and total serum biliru￾bin levels may require days to increase. Decreasing arterial
lactate levels will help assess adequate hepatic function.
Additional signs that the liver is sufficiently functioning
include increased blood glucose levels from hepatic
gluconeogenesis.
For patients undergoing hepatic artery or portal vein
reconstruction, an abdominal Doppler should be obtained
to ensure adequate flow and normal velocities. Portal vein
thrombosis may present as large volume ascites, encepha￾lopathy, and liver failure and needs to be addressed rapidly.
Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis should be weighed
against the risk of bleeding. Liver dysfunction is associated
with a decrease in pro- and anticoagulant factors and
thrombin formation may be normal or even increased
even in the presence of increased coagulation param￾eters.56 Low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated
heparin should be administered if there is no risk of
significant bleeding.57
Posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) has been defined
by a 2011 international consensus as the presence of
elevated INR and hyperbilirubinemia on postoperative
day 5. It is further subdivided into three clinical grades:
(1) biological liver failure requiring no change in manage￾ment, (2) deviation from regular course requiring no inva￾sive therapy, and (3) invasive treatment required. To date,
no studies have shown improved survival when treating
PHLF, and the only definitive treatment remains orthotopic
liver transplantation. Supportive care focuses on identify￾ing and treating the underlying etiology. Institution of
antibiotic therapy, identification of vascular compromise
or biliary leak, and appropriate nutritional supplementa￾tion (30% more in stressed states) are essential elements of
management. Encephalopathy should be treated, for exam￾ple, with lactulose, and mannitol can be utilized to reduce
intracranial hypertension. Clinically significant coagulop￾athy from thrombocytopenia or elevated INR resulting in
bleeding will require administration of clotting factors and
blood products. However, we caution against administer￾ing clotting factors only to treat elevated laboratory tests in
the absence of clinical significant bleeding or prior to
invasive procedures.58
The Patient with Liver Disease Undergoing
Nonhepatic Surgery
Determination of which patients are at risk of liver dys￾function after surgery is not clearly defined. Of note, the
available literature of surgical risk in patients with cirrhosis
is limited to retrospective investigations. Furthermore,
these studies typically involve patients with only mild
hepatic dysfunction, limiting their applicability to those
most at risk. Clearly, elective surgery is less common for
patients who simply will not survive without urgent liver
transplantation. However, in those less-acute patients with
liver disease, efforts to clearly define operative candidacy
have be challenging.
The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class can be quickly calcu￾lated at the bedside and is the metric often used in the clinical
studies, correlating well with mortality. The CTP scoring
system is based on the patient’s serum bilirubin, albumin,
prothrombin time, as well as the severity of ascites and
encephalopathy.59 The CTP class is often criticized based on
the subjective nature for two of its parameters (ascites and
encephalopathy) and its broad variation of hepatic function
within each class, especially within class B. Nonetheless,
mortality rates are predictable following general surgery
(CTP-A 10%, CTP-B 30%, CTP-C 76–82%).59 The CTP-B or
CTP-C patients are not candidates for elective major surgery.
The CTP-A patients with significant portal hypertension
characterized by thrombocytopenia (i.e., platelets
< 100,000), esophageal varices, or elevated portal pressures
by invasive monitoring are rarely candidates for elective
major surgery, and definitely not candidates for major liver
resections.
The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) was first
developed to determine survival after transjugular intrahe￾patic portocaval shunt (TIPS) procedures. However, in 2002
MELD was identified as a reliable index that could predict
short-term mortality rates of liver transplantation candi￾dates.60 The MELD score is calculated based on serum biliru￾bin, serum creatinine, and international normalized ratio. The
MELD is more objective than the CTP score and is a good
predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with cirrhosis
undergoing nontransplant surgery.61 The postoperative mor￾tality rate in nontransplant patients rises in a linear fashion
1% for each increase in MELD point below 20 and 2% for
MELDs above 20.61 Furthermore, several authors have dem￾onstrated that MELD scores above 14 predict a poor outcome
after intraabdominal surgery.62–64 Some have also demon￾strated that a MELD > 14 is comparable to CTP class C and
that MELD scores can correctly predict poor outcomes better
the CTP score (77 vs. 23%).64

Summary
Patients with underlying liver disease undergoing hepatic
resection face substantial risk of postoperative liver failure.
Precise assessment of preoperative liver function and reserve,
the extent of resection, and other comorbidities is essential to
be able to decide if the patient is a candidate for surgery. The
extent of resection can be evaluated using computed tomog￾raphy or magnetic resonance imaging scans and computer
simulations that allow virtual resection prior to surgery.
Comorbidities such as cardiac disease should be assessed
according to standard guidelines for no-cardiac surgery such
as the American Society of Anesthesiologists / American
Heart Association guidelines. Conventional liver function
tests are frequently too insensitive to assess liver reserve.
Dynamic liver function tests such as ICG clearance may be
better suited to detect patients with limited hepatic reserve
who may not tolerate major resections. Intraoperative man￾agement should aim to reduce further injury to the diseased
liver by avoiding hepatic ischemia, volume overload or
bleeding. Algorithms may help assess the risk of major
resections in patients with underlying liver disease. Howev￾er, in complex cases, the decision about operability should be
made by a team of experienced surgeons, hepatologists, and
anesthesiologists.
