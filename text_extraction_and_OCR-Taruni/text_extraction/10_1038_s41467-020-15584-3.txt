Acetaminophen (APAP) is the main cause of acute liver failure in the West. Specific
efficacious therapies for acute liver failure (ALF) are limited and time-dependent. The
mechanisms that drive irreversible acute liver failure remain poorly characterized. Here we
report that the recently discovered platelet receptor CLEC-2 (C-type lectin-like receptor)
perpetuates and worsens liver damage after toxic liver injury. Our data demonstrate that
blocking platelet CLEC-2 signalling enhances liver recovery from acute toxic liver injuries
(APAP and carbon tetrachloride) by increasing tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production
which then enhances reparative hepatic neutrophil recruitment. We provide data from
humans and mice demonstrating that platelet CLEC-2 influences the hepatic sterile inflam￾matory response and that this can be manipulated for therapeutic benefit in acute liver injury.
Since CLEC-2 mediated platelet activation is independent of major haemostatic pathways,
blocking this pathway represents a coagulopathy-sparing, specific and novel therapy in acute
liver failure.

Toxic liver injury exemplified by acetaminophen (APAP)
overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in
Europe and North America1; it is responsible for more
cases of ALF than all other aetiologies combined2. Acute liver
failure has a high mortality rate3 and accounts for 10% of all liver
transplants in the UK. Although N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can
prevent liver injury if given in time, once liver failure is estab￾lished the only treatment other than transplantation is
supportive4,5. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for effective
and specific treatments to reduce or reverse acute toxic liver
injury.
Hepatic injury in APAP overdose-induced acute liver failure in
humans follows a characteristic pattern with biochemical signs of
liver damage becoming apparent at 24–48 h6, and hepatocyte
death peaking at around 72 h7. In severe injury, this results in
fulminant liver failure necessitating superurgent liver transplan￾tation. Murine APAP toxicity closely mimics the human response
and is a valuable model for preclinical studies investigating toxic
liver damage8. APAP in both humans and mice is metabolized by
cytochrome P450 isoforms into the alkylating metabolite N￾acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)6. Excess NAPQI forma￾tion in APAP overdose, overwhelms the livers antioxidant glu￾tathione (GSH) reserves. This allows excess NAPQI to bind
mitochondrial proteins, forming cytotoxic adducts9 that drive
severe mitochondrial dysfunction and extensive hepatocellular
necrosis10. Another agent extensively studied in the context of
acute toxic murine liver injury is carbon tetrachloride (CCl4),
which is also metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes into
reactive intermediates11,12. These radicals cause hepatocyte
membrane lipid peroxidation and extensive hepatocellular
necrosis leading to liver failure.
Regardless of the aetiology13, hepatocyte necrosis in response
to toxic injury results in the release of damage associated mole￾cular patterns (DAMPs) from dying hepatocytes14. These activate
the innate immune system in what is termed ‘sterile inflamma￾tion’ (SI)14. SI is critical to liver healing and recovery but if
excessive can exacerbate liver injury and drive fulminant liver
failure13. Hepatic neutrophil infiltration represents a key part of
the innate immune response to acute liver injury14,15 and is
essential for liver recovery after a toxic liver insult16. The signals
that dictate whether the outcome of injury is regeneration and
healing on one hand, or progressive inflammatory damage on the
other are poorly understood. Elucidation of these mechanisms
could lead to novel treatments that reduce injury and enhance
hepatic recovery after a toxic injury.
An increasing body of recent literature recognizes that platelets
play a central but paradoxical role in liver injury, being able to
both drive damage and aid resolution17. Platelets interact with the
key protagonists of the sterile inflammatory response including
neutrophils and macrophages14 and enhance hepatic leucocyte
recruitment into the liver across the sinusoidal endothelium18.
Kupffer cells (liver resident macrophages) recognize. DAMP
expression and upregulate cytokines central to the initiation of
SI14. Neutrophils infiltrate the liver early after SI and are impli￾cated in mediating resolution from acute toxic liver injury after
CCl4 induced19 and thermal liver injury16. Whilst platelets have
been shown to accumulate within the liver during APAP medi￾ated liver toxicity and platelet depletion attenuates liver injury20;
little is actually known about the molecular basis of platelet
function during acute liver failure and specifically whether
manipulating platelet function influences the sterile inflammatory
response to toxic liver injury.
Platelet activation occurs through multiple pathways includ￾ing ligation of platelet-expressed C-type lectin-like receptor
(CLEC)-2 by its ligand podoplanin21. As inflammatory macro￾phages upregulate podoplanin22,23 and have an important role
in driving the sterile inflammatory response to toxic liver
injury14, we investigate whether CLEC-2 signalling driven by
inflammatory macrophages, including Kupffer cells and infil￾trating macrophages, plays a role in acute toxic liver injury.
Importantly as this platelet signalling pathway is independent of
major haemostatic pathways24 it potentially represents an
attractive avenue for the development of new therapies in liver
injuries that are often associated with coagulation impairments.
We present data in mice and humans demonstrating that
abrogation of CLEC-2 mediated platelet signalling enhances
recovery from acute liver injury through TNF-α dependent
hepatic recruitment of neutrophils.
Results
Podoplanin is upregulated during liver injury and platelets
sequester to podoplanin expressing macrophages. Podoplanin,
the cognate ligand for the platelet activating receptor CLEC-2 is
minimally expressed in the uninjured liver in both mice and
humans with expression primarily confined to periportal lym￾phatic vessels (Fig. 1a, b). In contrast, human and murine livers
respond to acute liver injury by increasing hepatic podoplanin
expression (Fig. 1a-APAP, 1b-CCl4 [mice] and APAP, c–f
[human]). Immunofluorescent podoplanin detection demon￾strated that during human acute APAP driven liver injury,
enhanced podoplanin expression was seen upon hepatic macro￾phages within pericentral areas (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1)
(where maximum APAP induced injury is seen) and also in
periportal areas (Fig. 1c ii). To establish the nature of the podo￾planin expressing macrophages we next phenotyped macrophages
from acutely injured murine livers25 and found that these were a
combination of infiltrating and resident (Kupffer) cells (Fig. 1d).
The increase in podoplanin mRNA expression within APAP
injured livers compared to non-injured control human liver tissue
was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 1e). To investigate whether platelets
are exposed to the increase in podoplanin in acute liver injury, we
stained for the platelet specific integrin subunit CD41. Figure 1f
shows that CD41 positive platelets colocalize with podoplanin￾positive hepatic macrophages during acute liver injury in mice
(Fig. 1f, upper row) and humans (Fig. 1f, lower row).
Blocking platelet CLEC-2 signalling accelerates liver healing
after toxic liver injury in mice. After establishing that hepatic
expression of podoplanin, the only known endogenous activating
ligand for CLEC-2, is increased after acute liver injury and that
platelets sequester to podoplanin expressing macrophages, we
investigated the functional consequences of blocking CLEC-2-
podoplanin interaction during acute liver damage. For this we
used Pf4CreCLEC1bfl/fl mice, that have deletion of CLEC-2 gene
(CLEC1b) in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage26. Hepatic
necroinflammation due to APAP or CCl4 is dependent on con￾version to hepatotoxic metabolites by cytochrome P450 CYP2E1
which is unaffected in the Pf4CreCLEC1bfl/fl mouse (Supple￾mentary Fig. 2). We observed liver injury indicated by increased
transaminase levels in serum as early as 6 h after treatment in
APAP treated mice and by 24 h in CCl4 treated mice (Fig. 2a, b).
There was no difference in the amount of hepatic damage
observed when comparing WT (wild type) and CLEC-2-deficient
mice at these early time points (Fig. 2a, b). However, at subsequent
time points (APAP—24 and 48 h; CCl4—48 and 72 h), CLEC-2-
deficient mice exhibited significantly lower serum ALT activity
compared to WT control mice which developed worsening liver
damage over time. This was supported by histological staining at
the time of maximal damage in WT mice (48 h—CCl4, or 24 h—
APAP) as shown in Fig. 2c, Control mice that had been given PBS
or mineral oil alone exhibited no liver injury (Fig. 2a, b, d). We

also noted that a reduced number of platelets were sequestered to
macrophages in peri-central areas in CLEC-2 deficient mice
compared to WT mice (Fig. 2d). Consistent with this, platelet P￾selectin staining was reduced in CLEC-2-deficient mice (Fig. 2e,
Supplementary Fig. 3).
Acute liver injury is exacerbated by podoplanin-mediated
CLEC-2 signalling. To investigate whether podoplanin-mediated
CLEC-2-dependent platelet activation perpetuated liver injury, we
used a transgenic podoplanin-deficient mouse model or a
podoplanin-blocking antibody. Mice with conditional deletion for
the gene encoding podoplanin expression on haematopoietic cells
(Vav1-iCre+PDPNfl/fl) and WT animals had similar levels of liver
injury at early time points, but in agreement with data from CLEC￾2-deficient mice, at the time of maximal liver damage (Fig. 2a, b)
podoplanin-deficient mice exhibited less hepatic damage as shown
by measurement of serum ALT activity (Fig. 3a) Similarly, treat￾ment of WT mice with a function-blocking antibody directed

against podoplanin, reduced liver injury at time points of maximal
liver injury (Fig. 3a) compared to isotype-matched antibody-trea￾ted controls. In support of this, histological analysis of sections
from these mice confirmed that WT or mice treated with the
isotype matched control antibody had greater amounts of peri￾central necrosis after CCl4 or APAP administration compared to
mice that had a genetic or antibody mediated deficiency in
podoplanin (Fig. 3b).
Blocking the CLEC-2 podoplanin axis enhances neutrophil
recruitment to the injured liver. To explain how inhibiting
platelet CLEC-2 signalling enhanced recovery from CCl4 or
APAP driven injury, we investigated the nature of the sterile
inflammatory response. Neutrophils are known to mediate liver
healing after sterile liver injury by clearing cellular debris through
phagocytosis16. Using flow cytometric assessment of liver infil￾trating immune cell populations we observed a significantly
greater number of neutrophils (Fig. 4a, b) infiltrating the injured
livers of CLEC-2- or podoplanin-deficient, or podoplanin
antibody-treated mice after administration of APAP or CCl4
compared to the livers of the corresponding control mice. This
was confirmed by immunostaining, Fig. 4c thus shows enhanced
numbers of elastase-positive neutrophils after liver injury within
the livers of CLEC-2/podoplanin deficient mice. Of note, the total
numbers of infiltrating leucocytes (see gating strategy for CD45+
cells, myeloid cells and lymphocytes shown in Supplementary
Figs. 4 and 5) were similar between WT and CLEC-2-deficient
mice at each time point, regardless of type of injury (Supple￾mentary Fig. 6). We next measured neutrophil function following
acute liver injury and found that neutrophils from CLEC-2-
deficient mice exhibited increased phagocytic ability compared to
those from WT mice (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 1). This
suggested that interfering with the CLEC-2/podoplanin axis not
only enhanced neutrophil recruitment to the injured liver but also
the ability of those neutrophils to phagocytose cellular debris. To
confirm that the reparative response was indeed neutrophil dri￾ven, we administered a selective neutrophil depleting anti-Ly6G
antibody to CLEC-2-deficient mice prior to CCl4 or APAP
administration. As expected, the antibody reduced hepatic neu￾trophil infiltration during acute liver injury (Fig. 4e) by depleting
circulating neutrophils (Fig. 4f); this then abrogated the protective
effect of CLEC-2 deficiency (Fig. 4g) to toxic liver injury.
Increased hepatic regeneration did not contribute to this observed
phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Neutrophil recruitment in CLEC-2-deficient animals is depen￾dent on macrophage TNF-α production. We have described
increased hepatic expression of podoplanin and platelet seques￾tration to podoplanin expressing macrophages during acute liver
injury. To investigate the functional consequences of this, we co￾cultured WT macrophages isolated from murine liver in LPS
(Supplementary Fig. 8) with platelets. Incubation of podoplanin￾expressing macrophages with CLEC-2 deficient platelets was
associated with increased TNF-α production relative to WT pla￾telets (Fig. 5a). To extend these findings in vivo, we stained for
TNF-α in hepatic macrophages and our cytometric assessment
showed that APAP injury induced TNF-α expression within
hepatic macrophages (Fig. 5b). Although the amount of TNF-α
expression per macrophage (Fig. 4b) was similar between mac￾rophages from WT and CLEC-2 deficient mice after APAP injury
(Fig. 5b), we observed that there was a significantly increase in the
total number of TNF-α expressing, podoplanin-positive infiltrat￾ing macrophages in CLEC-2 deficient mice (Fig. 5c). These data
suggest that the increase in the number of podoplanin-expressing
macrophages in CLEC-2 deficient mice drives the increase in total
TNF-α production after an acute liver injury. Consistent with this,
CLEC-2 deficient mice had significantly higher serum TNF-α
levels compared to WT mice after toxic liver injury (Fig. 5d). To
investigate whether the neutrophil recruitment we observed in the
CLEC-2 deficient mice was TNF-α dependent we used etanercept
to inhibit TNF-α prior to induction of liver injury. This restored
liver injury to WT levels (Fig. 5e) by inhibiting neutrophil
recruitment to the injured liver in CLEC-2-deficient mice (Fig. 5f).
These data support a model in which CLEC-2-or podoplanin
deficiency mediates its hepatoprotective effect through enhanced
macrophage driven TNF-α production and recruitment of
neutrophils.
Discussion
Platelets have been demonstrated to play important roles in
pathophysiological processes relevant to liver disease27,28; how￾ever, as these can be either detrimental or protective dependent
on the context17 their overall contribution to liver pathology is
unclear and is likely to be disease and stage-dependent28. We
report a mechanism through which platelet signalling through
CLEC-2 amplifies acute liver injury in response to APAP and
CCl4 toxicity. We demonstrate that selectively abrogating platelet
CLEC-2 signalling accelerates early recovery from toxic liver
injury by increasing hepatic neutrophil function and infiltration

through a TNF-α driven mechanism. Importantly as CLEC-2
mediated platelet activation is independent of major haemostatic
pathways21, the bleeding risk of CLEC-2 blockade is minimal23;
this remains an important consideration given the bleeding dia￾thesis often present in acute liver failure29–32.
We found that acute toxic injury to the liver results in
increased podoplanin expression on both resident and infiltrating
liver macrophages. Under resting or non-inflammatory condi￾tions there is minimal podoplanin expression in the liver. The
increased availability of podoplanin in the acutely injured liver
could provide the ligand to activate the CLEC-2 pathway within
platelets, which were noted to sequester to podoplanin-expressing
macrophages in acute liver injury in both mice and humans.

described in the context of peritonitis33, and in the liver during
sepsis driven by IFNγ and TLR421. This fits with the increased gut
permeability, bacterial translocation34 and the consumptive coa￾gulopathies that characterize acute liver injury1. Multiple studies
have established the role of CLEC-2 in driving platelet
activation26,35; investigators have previously demonstrated both
how inflammatory macrophages upregulate and activate platelets
via CLEC-2 in vitro22 and also the importance of this pathway in
modulating the outcome from hepatic inflammation21,23. We use
P-selectin to confirm intrahepatic platelet activation after an acute
liver injury and whilst we note lower amounts of P-selectin
expression in mice that are CLEC-2 deficient it is noteworthy that
P-selectin is stored within platelet granules and a degree of
constitutive expression is therefore unavoidable. This limitation
exists with other platelet granule stored markers of platelet acti￾vation including TREM-like transcript 1(TLT-1)36.
Enhanced liver recovery was associated with significantly
increased circulating levels of TNF-α in the CLEC-2-deficient
mice. Hepatic macrophage production of TNF-α has been shown
to mediate hepatic regeneration in hepatectomized mice37–39,

abrogating TNF-α function in these models inhibits liver recov￾ery40 and thus reduces survival. In human acute liver failure,
monocyte derived TNF-α has a clearly described protective role,
with low TNF-α levels due to monocyte exhaustion resulting in
poor outcomes41. Our in vitro experiments showed heightened
TNF-α production in CLEC-2 deficient platelet-macrophage
assays compared to WT platelet-macrophage assays. Lectin
receptors are important42 in allowing hepatic macrophages to
clear platelets from the circulation42,43; a CLEC-2 deficiency may
alter this process thereby minimizing exhaustion and maintaining
ability to secrete cytokine; this is consistent with our findings. The
underlying mechanism through which platelet CLEC-2 deficiency
alters cytokine production warrants further investigation. In vivo
we noted an increase in the number of podoplanin-positive
macrophages expressing TNF-α in CLEC-2 deficient mice com￾pared to WT mice after acute liver injury. This could be due to a
failure of infiltrating macrophages to egress from the inflamed
liver in a timely fashion. Indeed there is a previously described
role for the CLEC-2/podoplanin axis in facilitating the egress of
other antigen presenting cells from lymphoid organs44 and
stromal cells from areas of inflammation45. Taken together these
data suggest that activation of CLEC-2 signalling within platelets
by macrophage expressed podoplanin within the acutely injured
liver suppresses TNF-α release by those macrophages. Blocking
this activation accounts for the increase in circulating TNF-α
levels seen in CLEC-2 deficient mice after acute liver injury.
Although TNF-α is produced by multiple cell types during acute
liver injury, our in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that at
least part of this is derived from hepatic macrophages.
Platelet interactions with macrophages are known to modulate
macrophage function, differentiation and cytokine secretion46–48;
the molecular pathways that mediate these effects are poorly
understood. This is the first report of a molecular pathway (CLEC-2/
podoplanin) that links platelet function with an alteration of mac￾rophage cytokine responses, enhancement of neutrophil recruitment
and function and ultimately how this mediates restorative effects in
acute liver injury. It is prudent to however note that while TNF-α is
a pleiotropic cytokine having varied roles in liver injury, exhibiting
hepatoxicity in certain situations and aiding recovery in others49, it
appears that in acute toxic liver injuries the latter role is more sig￾nificant; this may explain in part the adverse outcomes seen in
patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis treated with anti-TNF-α
therapy50,51.
Blocking platelet CLEC-2 signalling by inducing a selective
platelet CLEC-2 deficiency or a podoplanin blockade resulted
in a reduction in hepatocellular damage and transaminase re￾lease through increased hepatic neutrophil recruitment. Whilst
authors52,53 have previously argued that neutrophils actively
drive APAP induced liver injury, these studies rely upon neu￾trophil depleting antibodies which have marked off target
effects54. Direct neutrophil driven hepatotoxicity was demon￾strated using hepatoma cells in vitro which have unclear rele￾vance to the in vivo sterile injury that APAP elicits52,54.
Importantly whilst numerous studies have shown that APAP
induced liver damage is not driven by neutrophils55,56, it is clear
that neutrophil activation and hepatic infiltration occurs after
APAP induced liver damage16,57,58. This neutrophil infiltration is
increasingly thought to represent the innate immune reparative
response designed to aid a return to hepatic homoeostasis after
acute injury15,59,60. Our data demonstrate that platelet CLEC-2
deficiency enhances both hepatic neutrophil infiltration and
neutrophil phagocytic function. Based on our ability to abrogate
hepatic neutrophil recruitment with etanercept, it is likely that
heightened TNF-α production plays a critical role in hepatic
recruitment of neutrophils in CLEC-2-deficient mice. This sup￾ports previous reports of the neutrophil ‘function’ enhancing role
of TNF-α61, including phagocytosis, which then plays a funda￾ment role in halting liver damage and driving hepatic recovery in
acute liver injury16,62. Neutrophils thus mediate liver healing
after APAP induced liver injury51 with defective neutrophil
function resulting in poor outcomes63–65. This has direct rele￾vance to the clinic where enhancing neutrophil numbers and
function using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)
improves survival in patients with acute liver failure66 and severe
alcoholic hepatitis67. Although our data suggest that neutrophil
recruitment is driven by hepatic macrophage produced TNF-α,
additional platelet–neutrophil–endothelium interactions may
also have a role. Specifically, platelet attachment to the sinusoidal
endothelium18, formation of circulating neutrophil: platelet
aggregates or enhanced NET formation68 could also contribute
to our observations of neutrophil mediated liver recovery in
CLEC-2 deficiency. Finally, it is also possible that enhanced
TNF-α production we observed with CLEC-2 deficiency resulted
in increased recruitment or activation of Cd11b+ myeloid￾derived suppressor cells69 that could then accentuate the negative
feedback regulation of hepatic inflammation after exposure to
hepatotoxicant70,71.
In conclusion, during acute liver injury hepatic macrophages
upregulate podoplanin; the resultant CLEC-2 driven platelet
activation dampens TNF-α production which then impedes
restorative neutrophil mediated liver repair. By interfering with
the CLEC-2/podoplanin axis, we provide the first demonstration
of a mechanism to enhance neutrophil mediated reparative sterile
inflammation to drive efficient and rapid liver recovery. Given the
Fig. 4 Blocking CLEC-2-mediated platelet activation enhances hepatic neutrophil accumulation. Livers from mice sacrificed at the above time point of
peak injury [48 h after CCl4 (1 mg/kg) and 24 h after APAP (350 mg/kg)] were digested and neutrophils were isolated, quantified by flow cytometry and
expressed as number of cells per gram of liver tissue from mice with either a genetic CLEC-2 (CLEC1bfl/flPf4Cre) or podoplanin (Vav1-iCre+ pdpnfl/fl)
deficiency or an antibody mediated podoplanin blockade and the corresponding controls. a Our strategy to define live gated CD45+Cd3−CD11b+Gr1+ cells
(neutrophils) is shown. b number of neutrophils per gram of liver tissue at the time points mentioned above comparing either control WT and CLEC-2-
deficient mice or control WT and podoplanin-deficient or mice that had been treated with a function blocking podoplanin antibody and corresponding
isotype matched controls are shown (n = 4–9). c Liver sections were stained with neutrophil elastase DAB stain (arrows), representative fields from anti￾podoplanin antibody (bottom picture) and isotype antibody (top figure) treated mice are shown at ×20 magnification acquired using a Leica CTR6000

challenge of managing patients who present with significant acute
liver injuries, there are therapeutic implications for this work and
inhibition of interactions between CLEC-2 and podoplanin are an
exciting target to explore in human ALF.
Methods
Mice. C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Harlan OLAC Ltd or from in-house
colonies. Vav1-iCre+pdpnfl/fl mice23 and Pf4CreCLEC1bfl/fl mice are described
elsewhere26. All strains of genetically-altered mice were on a C57BL/6J background.
Littermates that were negative for Cre recombinase and thus matched by genetic
background, age and sex were used as controls. All mice were housed at the
Biomedical Services Unit, University of Birmingham. All experiments were per￾formed in accordance with UK laws (Animal [Scientific Procedures] Act 1986) with
approval of local ethics committee and UK Home Office approval under PPL
P2DF9DB6E and 70/7933 granted to the University of Birmingham.
Human tissue. All tissue used in this investigation was collected at the Liver and
Hepatobiliary Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, with prior written
informed patient consent and local research ethics committee approval (06/Q702/61)
Normal liver tissue was from hepatic resection margins from colorectal cancer
metastases and donor tissue that was surplus to requirement for transplantation.
Diseased liver tissue was obtained from explanted livers with APAP induced fulmi￾nant liver failure, obtained from patients in the Birmingham liver transplant
programme.
Induction of liver injury and therapeutic intervention. Acute hepatic inflam￾mation was induced using intraperitoneal (IP) injections of CCl4 or APAP (both
Sigma-Aldrich). CCl4 was diluted 1:4 with mineral oil and injected intraper￾itoneally into mice at a dose of 1 ml/kg (control animals were treated with IP
mineral oil alone). APAP was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a
temperature of 60 °C. The solution was cooled to 37 °C prior to injection at a final
concentration of 350 mg/kg and control mice received IP PBS alone. Where
indicated, mice were pre-treated intravenously with 5 μg/kg of functional grade

purified anti-podoplanin (Clone 8.1.1), or the corresponding isotype matched
control antibody (golden Syrian hamster IgG) 24 h prior to being given either IP
APAP or CCl4. Experiments requiring TNF-α blockade were conducted using
Etanercept (10 mg/kg, Amgen), control animals were given PBS alone. Mice were
culled and tissue (liver and blood) collected either 6, 24 or 48 h after APAP
injection and 24, 48 or 72 h after CCl4 injection.
Quantification of liver-infiltrating immune cells. Mouse livers were harvested
after the animal was euthanized under deep sedation (using isoflurane) and blood was
collected by cardiac puncture. After weighing, a single liver lobe was dissociated in a
gentleMACS homogenizer (Miltenyi Biotec). The homogenate was filtered through
70 μm filters (Falcon) and centrifuged at 1000 g to allow the cells to form a pellet.
Following resuspension of the cells in RPMI 1640 medium (Roswell Park Memorial
Institute) (Thermo-Fisher Scientific), a density gradient medium (OptiPrepTM-Sigma
Aldrich) was used to selectively isolate leucocytes. These immune cells were next
stained with fluorphores as per manufacturers instructions and then analzyed flow
cytometrically64. CD45+ cells were gated (anti–CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5, clone 30-F11; BD
Biosciences), and nonviable cells were excluded using a Zombie NIR™ Fixable Via￾bility kit (Biolegend). Lymphocytes were characterized based on staining using a
cocktail of anti–CD3-Pacific blue (clone 500A2); anti–CD4-PE (clone RM4-5);
anti–CD8a-APC (clone 53-6.7); anti–CD19-APC-Cy7 or anti–CD19-BV510 (both
clone 1D3); and anti–NK1.1-FITC (clone PK136) or DX5-FITC (clone DX5) anti￾bodies (all from BD Biosciences) while the monocyte subsets were identified by
staining with anti–CD11b-PE (clone M1/70; BD Biosciences); anti–GR1-APC (clone
RB6-8C5; BD Biosciences); and anti–F4/80-FITC (clone BM8; eBioscience) anti￾bodies. Podoplanin staining was identified using anti-podoplanin PE (clone 8.1.1;
Biolegend). For intracellular TNF-α staining (, stained cells prepared as described
above were suspended in intracellular buffer for 1 h and then permeabilized as per
manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience) prior to staining with the anti-TNF-α
antibody (anti- TNF-α PE-Cy7; Clone MP6-XT22; Biolegend). Absolute cell counts
were determined with AccuCheck Counting Beads (Invitrogen), and the number of
cells was normalized to the liver weight. Data were analysed using a CyAn ADP flow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and FlowJo version 8.7 (Treestar software).
Immunohistology and confocal microscopy. Murine and human liver was snap￾frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 4% formaldehyde (NHS supplies) immediately
upon removal. Paraffin-embedded 3 μm mouse and human tissue sections were
then stained with either haematoxylin and eosin according to standard protocols or
anti-podoplanin (mouse- eBio8.1.1, eBioscience; human- LpMab-21, Biolegend),
anti-neutrophil elastase antibody (ab68672, Abcam) or anti-CYP2E1 (Biolegend)
antibodies; these were then detected using horse-radish peroxidase conjugated
secondary antibodies and developed using alkaline-phosphatase (ABComplex,
Vector Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB). Frozen
tissue sections (mice and human) were prepared at a 7 μm thickness and then
stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in Tris buffer (pH 7.6, Sigma) with 1%
FCS (fetal calf serum)21 to either detect murine podoplanin (eBio8.1.1,
eBioscience); the secondary used was a goat anti-Syrian hamster Cy3 IgG
(ab102318, Abcam) or human podoplanin (LpMab-21, Biolegend) the secondary in
this case was a goat anti-mouse Cy3 IgG (ab97035, Abcam). Murine macrophages
(FITC anti-mouse F4/80, BM8, Biolegend), human macrophages (FITC antihuman
CD68, Y1/82 A, Biolegend), murine platelets (Brilliant Violet 605™ anti-mouse
CD41, MWReg30, Biolegend) and human platelets (Alexa Fluor® 647 anti-human
CD41/CD61 Antibody, PAC-1, Biolegend) were detected in frozen sections using
the above described conjugated antibodies. Finally, mouse P-selectin was detected
in frozen sections using a rat anti-mouse P-selectin antibody (mouse P-Selectin/
CD62P, 127933, R&D systems); secondary used here was a goat anti-rat Cy3 IgG
(ab98416, Abcam). Neutrophils were detected in paraffin sections using a neu￾trophil elastase AB (ab68672, Abcam). Manufacturer recommended control anti￾bodies were used for each antibody. Primary and secondary antibodies were
incubated for 60 min each at room temperature for paraffin sections. Primary and
secondary antibodies on paraffin sections were used at concentrations of 1 μg/ml
and 0.5 μg/ml respectively. All imaging was done at room temperature. DAB slides
were mounted in (dityrene plasticizer xylene) DPX and images acquired at ×10,
×20 or ×40 magnification using a Leica CTR6000 microscope (Leica, Milton
Keynes, UK) with QCapture software. Frozen sections were incubated with primary
or conjugated antibodies for 90 min and secondary antibodies for 45 min, the
sections were then counterstained with DAPI to highlight nuclei (10 μg/ml). Slides
were mounted using Prolong Gold Anti-fade Reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and
images were captured at ×10, ×40 or ×63 magnification on a LSM510 laser scan￾ning confocal microscope with a Zeiss AxioVert 100 M or a Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan
detector set to SR mode using Zeiss LSM image software. Images were analysed
using Zen blue (2012) software. Isotype matched control staining is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 9.
Low magnification images brightfield and fluorescent images were acquired
using a Carl Zeiss AxioScan Z1 Slide Scanner using a 3CCD colour 2MP Hitachi
1200×1600 HV-F202SCL camera. Images were analysed using Zen blue (2012)
slide scan software. Where quantification was sought image J version 1.x (National
Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational
Instrumentation, University of Wisconsin) was used.
Biochemical assessment of liver injury. Serum from mice was used for quanti￾fication of liver-specific enzymes using standard protocols on a Beckman Coulter
AU400 analyser.
Macrophage isolation. Liver macrophages were isolated from murine livers using
Blomhoff’s method of selective plastic adherence72. Liver tissue was non￾enzymatically digested in a gentleMACS homogenizer and cell pellets were re￾suspended with 10 ml RPMI 1640 and centrifuged at 300×g for 5 min at 4 °C. After
repeated slow spins at 300×g, the cell pellet which now mainly contained non￾parenchymal liver cells including Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells was
then seeded into 6-well plate at a density of 1–3 × 107/well in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Hyclone, USA) and 100U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Sigma, USA)
and incubated for 2 h in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were
then removed from the dish by gently washing with PBS, leaving behind the
adherent macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Platelet isolation. Platelets were isolated from murine whole blood from either
wild type or Pf4creCLEC1bfl/fl mice24. Briefly, a 25 gauge 1 ml syringe pre-filled
with 100 μl of acid citrate dextrose was used to obtain murine blood via cardiac
puncture. The whole blood was then centrifuged at 200×g for 7 min. The top layer
of platelet rich plasma (PRP) was removed. In all, 200 μl of Tyrode’s buffer
composition was added to the remaining blood, and the suspension centrifuged for
a further 5 min at 200×g, the top phase was again removed and added to the PRP
from the previous step. To prevent platelet activation 1 μl of prostacyclin (1 mg/ml)
was added per ml of PRP.
Neutrophil activation. The phagocytic ability of neutrophils was assessed using a
phago-testTM kit as per manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). Briefly,
whole blood was extracted from deeply anesthetized mice (either CLEC-2 deficient
or control mice), 24 h after APAP administration and placed into heparin con￾taining tubes. The heparinized blood was then incubated with FITC labelled bac￾teria, the reaction was stopped after a pre-determined time by placing the solution
on ice. Bacteria that were merely attached to the surface of the phagocyte rather
than actually phagocytosed were washed off using a quenching solution. After
erythrocyte lysis, neutrophils were flow-cytometrically isolated with the FITC+
bacteria containing percentage identified as per the gating strategy described by the
manufacturer and shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Macrophage and platelet co-culture. Macrophages isolated from wild type
murine livers as described above, were stimulated with LPS (lipopolysaccharide￾100 ng/ml, Sigma) and then co-cultured with either wild type or CLEC-2 deficient
platelets. The supernatant was collected after 24 h and stored at −80 °C until use.
The remaining cells were fixed in formalin and stained using conjugated fluor￾escent antibodies as describe above.
TNF-α ELISA. TNF-alpha levels were determined in either mouse serum or cell
culture supernatant from the macrophage assays described above was determined
using a sandwich ELISA technique according to manufacturer’s instructions
(eBioscience).
Quantitation of podoplanin mRNA from human liver. RNA was extracted from
human livers using a RNEasy kit (Qiagen, UK) and cDNA was generated using a
High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (ThermoFisher, UK) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Real time PCR (pdpn assay ID Hs00366766_m1) was
carried out on each sample in triplicate using a Roche Lightcycler 480 machine
Taqman Assay Mix (Life Technologies, UK). Cycling conditions were: 95 °C 10 s,
60 °C 50 s, 72 °C 1 s. For relative quantification analysis data were normalised to
housekeeping gene(s) (GADPH; assay ID Hs02786624_g1) using ‘E-analysis’
(Roche Diagnostics Ltd) and the device software.
Statistical analysis. Data is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM). Numbers of animals in each model are stated in the figure legends. Dif￾ferences were analysed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad software Inc.,
La Jolla, CA, USA). Normality was checked using either the Shapiro-Wilk or
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (depending upon the n number in that particular
experiment). Normally distributed data were compared using the Students
unpaired t-test and non-normally distributed data were compared using
the Mann–Whitney test. When more than two groups were being compared
an ordinary one-way ANOVA was used. P values of ≤0.05 were considered
significant.
