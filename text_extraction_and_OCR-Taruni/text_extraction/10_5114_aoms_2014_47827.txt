Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors – state of knowledge
Krzysztof Lis, Olga Kuzawińska, Ewa Bałkowiec-Iskra
Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is considered a major proinflammatory cytokine, 
affecting various aspects of the immune reaction. All five TNF inhibitors 
currently available on the market (i.e., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, 
certolizumab and golimumab) are top sellers, although indicated only in 
autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and 
psoriasis. This article briefly discusses the background and place for TNF 
inhibitors in modern therapy. The main safety aspects of TNF inhibitor 
administration are described in particular, with special consideration of the 
available meta-analyses. Finally, perspectives on the next-generation TNF 
inhibitors and their use in the clinic are given. 
Key words: tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, biologic agents, adverse 
effect, rheumatic disease.
Introduction
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was cloned and characterized almost 30 
years ago, in 1984 [1]. It is a proinflammatory cytokine, being produced 
primarily by activated monocytes/macrophages [2]. TNF is synthesized as 
a transmembrane protein (tmTNF) and cleaved by the matrix metallopro￾teinase TNF converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM 17) to soluble TNF (solTNF) 
[3]. Both forms are biologically active. TNF is considered a major player 
in inflammatory reactions. Its wide range of biological effects, mediated 
through apoptosis [4], include antitumor and antiviral activities, as well 
as mediation of cachexia. However, the extreme toxicity of TNF dramat￾ically limits its clinical use, and the human recombinant TNF tasonermin 
(trade name Beromun), although approved for oncological treatment, is 
used only in isolated limb perfusion chemotherapy [5, 6].
Much more successful, from both a  clinical and a  commercial per￾spective, was development and use of TNF antagonists. Five approved 
anti-TNF biologics achieved in 2008 annual sales of over 16 billion US dol￾lars. Three TNF inhibitors, etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, are top 
selling drugs of any class, with cumulated projected sales of $26.5 billion 
in 2012 [7] (Table I). The three anti-TNF biologics were initially developed 
to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but current indications also include such 
conditions as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and plaque psoriasis.

TNF and TNF receptors
While both forms of TNF, i.e. solTNF and tmTNF, 
are biologically active, they have distinctly differ￾ent roles. The transmembrane form, tmTNF, has 
been shown to play a  crucial role in maintain￾ing the physiological innate immune response to 
infections, such as tuberculosis, listeriosis and 
leishmaniasis, and also to provide tolerance to 
autoantigens [8, 9]. The broadly accepted main 
role of solTNF is to drive the inflammatory re￾sponse. This function has been proven in animal 
studies showing that inhibition of solTNF caus￾es the anti-inflammatory effect. Inhibition of 
tmTNF, on the other hand, results in increased 
sensitivity to infection and exacerbation of de￾myelination. 
TNF acts through its receptors (TNFR). These 
receptors can be either constitutively expressed 
(TNFR1, p55) or inducible (TNFR2, p75) [10]. Both 
receptors are membrane glycoproteins, but they 
differ in expression, ligand affinity and signaling 
pathway activation. TNFR1 serves as the ma￾jor mediator of TNF action. It can be activated 
by binding of either solTNF or tmTNF, but with 
a  significant preference for solTNF. TNFR2, on 
the other hand, is preferentially activated by 
tmTNF [11]. The specific receptor expression 
depends on the cell type. While TNFR1 is ex￾pressed in most cell types, TNFR2 expression is 
limited to specific cells (i.e., oligodendrocytes, 
microglia and astrocytes in the CNS, endotheli￾al cells, lymphocytes and cardiac myocytes) [12].
The two receptor types differ in their biological 
roles. TNFR1 is responsible for initiating inflam￾matory responses and mediating apoptosis, but 
also for protection against tuberculosis infec￾tion [13]. TNFR2 facilitates antiviral immune re￾sponses through generation of cytotoxic T-lym￾phocytes [14]. Current clinically approved TNF 
inhibitors block both solTNF and tmTNF (Table II), 
and this lack of ligand selectivity may be the 
cause of serious side effects of the therapy. 
TNF antagonist structures and properties
Presently, there are five TNF inhibitors ap￾proved for the treatment of various autoimmune 
diseases: etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, cer￾tolizumab and golimumab (Table III).
Infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab are bi￾valent IgG monoclonal antibodies, but only ada￾limumab and golimumab are fully human. Adali￾mumab is a  humanized bivalent mouse IgG1 
monoclonal antibody. It binds specifically to TNF 
and neutralizes the biological function of TNF 
by blocking its interaction with both TNFR1 and 
TNFR2 receptors. Golimumab forms high-affinity

complexes with both solTNF and tmTNF, prevent￾ing their binding to receptors.
Infliximab is a chimeric bivalent IgG1 human￾murine protein containing about 25% mouse-de￾rived amino acids. It binds with high affinity to 
both soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF, 
but not to lymphotoxin α (TNFβ
). Certolizumab is 
the Fab’ fragment of a  recombinant, humanized 
antibody against both solTNF and tmTNF. It does 
not contain the Fc region.
Etanercept is a genetically engineered fusion pro￾tein, and consists of the Fc domain of human IgG1 
fused to a dimer of the extracellular ligand-binding 
domain of human TNFR2/p75. It binds with high 
affinity to both soluble and transmembrane forms 
of TNF. It is worth noting that etanercept is the only 
clinically approved TNF inhibitor which binds also to 
lymphotoxin α (TNFβ
) [15]. The unique structure of 
etanercept is probably responsible for its properties. 
Compared to infliximab and adalimumab, etanercept 
exerts significantly lower complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity and outside-to-inside signals (apoptosis/
cell cycle arrest) through the transmembrane TNF. 
This feature may also be the cause of its inefficacy 
in the treatment of granulomatous diseases such as 
Crohn’s disease and Wegener’s granulomatosis [16].
All the inhibitors competitively inhibit the bind￾ing of TNF to its receptors. However, they differ in 
both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynam￾ic properties, leading to significant differences in 
their clinical efficacy and indications. For example, 
it has been shown that approximately one-third of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were pri￾mary non-responders to the anti-TNF therapy [17]. 
The observed heterogeneity in the treatment re￾sponsiveness may also be associated with genetic 
factors. Namely, different polymorphic variants of 
the TNF gene have recently been linked to autoim￾mune diseases [18].
Approved indications of TNF inhibitors 
The European Medicines Agency has approved 
several indications for each of the five TNF inhib￾itors described above, as summarized in Table III. 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
Adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, certoli￾zumab and golimumab are currently indicated in 
the treatment of:
– Moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthri￾tis in adult patients, who did not respond ad￾equately to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs including methotrexate;
– Severe, active and progressive rheumatoid ar￾thritis in adults not previously treated with 
methotrexate;
– Rheumatoid arthritis in case of intolerance to 
methotrexate or if continued treatment with 
methotrexate was ineffective.
The effects of TNF blockade have been summa￾rized by Feldmann and Maini (2010), and they in￾clude: 1) normalization of IL-6 level in serum with￾in a few hours of anti-TNF treatment, 2) reduction 
of chemokine and adhesion molecule expression 
in joints, 3) restoration of osteoprotegerin levels 
and reduction of matrix metalloproteinase levels 
in cartilage and bone, and 4) slowing bone de￾struction.
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
Adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, certoli￾zumab and golimumab are all indicated in the 
treatment of:
– Severe active ankylosing spondylitis that had an 
inadequate response to the conventional ther￾apy;
– Severe axial spondyloarthritis without radio￾graphic evidence of AS but with objective signs 
of inflammation (elevated CRP and/or MRI), in 
patients who have had an inadequate response 
to, or are intolerant of, nonsteroidal anti-inflam￾matory drugs.
Adalimumab is also approved for the treatment 
of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
in combination with methotrexate, in children and 
adolescents aged 2 to 17 years who have had an 
inadequate response to one or more disease-mod￾ifying anti-rheumatic drugs.

1178 Arch Med Sci 6, December / 2014
Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA)
Adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept are ap￾proved for the treatment of moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who 
failed to respond to, or who have contraindica￾tions to, or are intolerant to, other systemic thera￾pies such as cyclosporine, methotrexate or PUVA. 
Adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept and goli￾mumab are approved for the treatment of active 
and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults with 
an inadequate response to previous disease-mod￾ifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy. 
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Adalimumab and infliximab are approved for 
treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease, in adult patients who have not respond￾ed to a full and adequate course of therapy with 
a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant, or 
who are intolerant to or have medical contraindi￾cations for such therapies. 
Adalimumab and infliximab are registered for 
the treatment of severe active Crohn’s disease 
in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) who 
have had an inadequate response to conventional 
therapy including primary nutrition therapy, a cor￾ticosteroid, and an immunomodulator, or who are 
intolerant to or have contraindications for such 
therapies. 
Infliximab and adalimumab are approved for 
treatment of moderately to severely active ulcer￾ative colitis in adult patients who have had an in￾adequate response to conventional therapy includ￾ing corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 
or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or 
have medical contraindications for such therapies.
Off-label indications of TNF inhibitors
Beside the approved therapies, TNF inhibitors 
are also used in off-label indications. Even though 
in most of these cases large, controlled studies are 
still lacking, case reports indicate their efficacy in 
selected conditions (Table IV). 
Granulomatous diseases – sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a  granulomatous inflammatory 
disease of unclear etiology. TNF, produced by mac￾rophages, plays a key role in the pathology of the 
disease, and is responsible for the formation of 
granulomas and progression of the disease. A sys￾tematic review of the literature together with the 
analysis of the Spanish registry of biological ther￾apies BIOBADASER, which evaluates safety, effica￾cy and effectiveness of infliximab and etanercept,

has not found sufficient evidence ensuring their 
effectiveness in sarcoidosis. However, the authors 
conclude that infliximab can cause moderate im￾provement of selected signs of the disease [19]. 
Adalimumab has been shown to be less effective 
than infliximab, and a phase II trial of etanercept 
in the treatment of stage II or III progressive pul￾monary sarcoidosis was terminated due to lack 
of efficacy [20]. Paradoxically, there are reports 
describing cases of new onset sarcoidosis-like 
diseases in patients treated with etanercept, in￾fliximab and adalimumab [21]. This phenomenon 
clearly shows that the data to support a  role of 
TNF in sarcoidosis are insufficient. 
Ophthalmic indications
Uveitis can have a wide range of clinical pre￾sentations, as it refers to ocular inflammation of 
the iris, choroid and ciliary body. Treatment of 
uveitis is dependent on the location and severi￾ty of inflammation. Whereas there are no TNF 
inhibitors approved for the treatment of uveitis, 
they are being used off-label [22]. One of the best 
studied is ocular inflammation in Behcet disease. 
Behcet disease is a chronic, relapsing inflamma￾tory disease, and ocular inflammation is one of 
the most common and severe signs of the dis￾ease. Infliximab has been shown to induce a rapid 
clinical remission with an improvement in visual 
acuity. Other studies showed fewer recurrences 
and a lower number of attacks in patients treated 
with infliximab versus standard treatment [23]. In 
a recent, double-blind, randomized, placebo-con￾trolled trial, infliximab was shown to cause signif￾icant improvement of visual acuity in the treat￾ment of diabetic macular edema [24].
Skin disorders
Acne inversa (hidradenitis suppurativa) is a chro￾nic inflammatory condition that affects mainly 
young females. As acne inversa may coexist with 
Crohn’s disease and spondyloarthropathy, it is 
suggested that dysfunction of the immune sys￾tem may play a  role in the pathogenesis of the 
disease. The efficacy of infliximab, adalimumab 
and etanercept in the treatment of acne inversa 
has been shown in many case-report studies [25].
Promising results have also been obtained in the 
treatment of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, 
pityriasis rubra pilaris, eosinophilic fasciitis, pan￾niculitis, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and 
cicatricial pemphigoid [23, 26].
Safety profile of TNF inhibitors
Safety concerns are the most important reason 
for the withdrawal of a drug from the market. Due 
to their relatively short presence on the market, 
all reports concerning TNF inhibitors, as belonging 
to the class of biologics, are very thoroughly ana￾lyzed by government authorities, such as the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European 
Medicines Agency. If medical research studies in￾dicate that the drug carries a significant risk of se￾rious, or even life-threatening, adverse effects, the 
“black box” warning is issued. It is the strongest 
warning that the FDA requires. It is so named for 
the black border that usually surrounds the text 
of the warning, appearing on the labeling of the 
prescription drug, or in the literature describing it. 
For TNF inhibitors, three warnings have been is￾sued: 1) increased risk for developing serious infec￾tions (including tuberculosis (TB), histoplasmosis, 
listeriosis, Pneumocystis pneumonia) that may lead 
to hospitalization or death (2008); 2) increased risk 
of developing lymphoma and other malignancies, 
some fatal, in children and adolescent patients 
(2009), and 3) post-marketing cases of fatal hepato￾splenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell 
lymphoma (2011; for more details, see Table V). 
Moreover, safety alerts are released in case of any 
new important safety data. All the safety alerts issu￾ed for TNF antagonists are summarized in Table VI. 
Also, drug information, such as Core Company Data 
Sheets and Summary of Product Characteristics, is 
updated regularly (Table VII). 
An important part of the safety profile of a drug 
is interactions with other products. It is worth 
stressing that TNF inhibitors very rarely cause drug 
interactions. In clinical trials, no interactions have 
been reported when etanercept or certolizumab 
was administered with glucocorticoids, salicylates 
(excluding sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-in￾flammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, or metho￾trexate. For infliximab, even though no systematic 
studies have been performed, single reports sug￾gest a possibility of interactions with methotrex￾ate and immunomodulatory drugs. According to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics, it is not 
recommended to use TNF inhibitors with anakinra 
and abatacept.
An important safety concern for the use of TNF 
inhibitors is the risk of inducing antidrug antibod￾ies. Immunogenicity may result in serious clinical 
consequences, such as reduction in efficacy of 
the drug and infusion or injection site reactions. 
Chimeric antibodies have been shown to be more 
immunogenic than humanized or human antibod￾ies. One of the studies of patients with RA found 
anti-infliximab antibodies in more than 40% of 
patients [27]. 
All of the available clinical trials bring new in￾formation about potentially harmful effects of TNF 
inhibitors. Most of the effects result from the direct 
inhibition of TNF. However, valuable conclusions 
can be made only based on meta-analyses. This

relatively new tool is used often, for example, by 
Health Technology Agencies. Conclusions drawn 
from meta-analyses that suggest an increased risk 
for serious infections, malignancy, autoimmune 
disorders, and congestive heart failure in patients 
treated with TNF inhibitors are presented below.
Serious infections
As all five TNF inhibitors that are currently 
available on the market non-selectively block TNF, 
thus affecting the immune system and impairing 
host defense mechanisms, they may also result 
in an increased risk of serious infections, such as 
pneumonia, tuberculosis, sepsis, osteomyelitis 
and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
The analysis of serious infections in head-to-head 
studies and randomized controlled trials with 
placebo or disease-modifying agents showed in￾creased incidence with certolizumab, compared 
to adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab 
and placebo. Compared to control groups, the risk 
of serious infections was increased in patients 
treated with adalimumab, certolizumab, golimum￾ab and infliximab, but not with etanercept [28]. 
The most common infections include lower respi￾ratory tract and skin infections. Tuberculosis was 
shown to be the most common opportunistic in￾fection. Observational studies showed increased 
risk of tuberculosis during treatment with TNF 
antagonists, with the estimated incidence of 52.5 
cases per 100  000 patient-years [29]. The risk 
of tuberculosis appeared to be increased with 
adalimumab and infliximab when compared with 
etanercept [30]. In a very elegant paper by Tubach 
et al., summarizing data of the RATIO registry, the 
risk of developing tuberculosis was shown to be 
higher in patients treated with adalimumab and 
infliximab, compared to etanercept. The proposed 
mechanisms include a critical role of tmTNF in the 
host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis
infection. Antagonizing the tmTNF action by anti￾TNF monoclonal antibodies may lead to inhibition 
of granuloma formation, which is a  protective 
reaction for host defense [31]. Among other re￾ported opportunistic infections were: candidiasis, 
listeriosis, Pneumocystis carinii, and herpes zos￾ter. Some studies also suggest an increased risk 
of herpes zoster infection in patients treated with 
TNF antagonists, except for etanercept [32].

Patients treated with Trade name are at increased risk for developing serious infections that 
may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking 
concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. 
Trade name should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. 
Reported infections include: 
• Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis 
have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be 
tested for latent tuberculosis before Trade name use and during therapy. Treatment for latent 
infection should be initiated prior to Trade name use. 
• Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, 
aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other 
invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. 
Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active 
infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive 
fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. 
• Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and 
Listeria. 
The risks and benefits of treatment with Trade name l should be carefully considered prior to 
initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. 
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection 
during and after treatment with Trade name, including the possible development of tuberculosis 
in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. 
Malignancies 
Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent 
patients treated with TNF blockers, including Trade name. 
Adalimumab
Infliximab
Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, 
have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including Trade name. These cases 
have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF 
blocker cases has occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority 
were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment 
with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. 
It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF 
blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants.

Malignancy
Originating in the basic mechanism of TNF ac￾tion, TNF inhibitors were expected to cause an im￾balance in antitumor mechanisms. Although TNF 
was originally discovered as an anti-tumor cyto￾kine, recombinant TNF is used in clinical practice 
only in the treatment of irresectable soft tissue 
sarcoma of the limbs, due to serious untoward 
effects resulting from systemic administration. 
Moreover, experiments revealed pro-tumor actions 
of TNF. Namely, malignant cell-derived TNF has 
been proven to enhance the growth and spread of 
tumors of the skin, ovary, pancreas, pleural cavity 
and bowel, although the underlying mechanisms 
of these phenomena are not fully understood. It 
has been postulated that most pro-tumor actions 
are mediated through the TNFR1 receptor, which 
is present on tumor and stromal cells [33, 34].
Some studies showed increased risk of non￾melanoma skin cancer associated with the use of 
adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab. In 2009, 
the FDA issued a  warning about the potential 
risk of malignancy in children. A  systematic re￾view of 25 clinical trials showed the varying risks 
of malignancy in patients with psoriatic arthritis 
treated with etanercept, infliximab or adalimum￾ab [35]. However, two other meta-analyses, of 
etanercept alone [36], and adalimumab, infliximab 
and etanercept, performed on more than 26 000 
patients, did not prove a  statistically significant 
increase in the risk of malignancy [37]. Similarly, 
no increase was indicated with certolizumab and 
golimumab [38, 39]. In addition, no increase in risk 
of solid tumors was detected in patients treated 
with adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab.

of an ongoing phase 2 trial in patients with moderate to severe CHF demonstrated 
higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients 
treated with Remicade, especially those treated with the higher dose of 10 mg/kg.
2001 Infliximab Cases of tuberculosis and other serious opportunistic infections, including 
histoplasmosis, listeriosis, and pneumocystosis reported in both the clinical research 
and post-marking surveillance settings. Some of these infections have been fatal. 
2004 Infliximab Cases of severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis and 
cholestasis reported in postmarketing data in patients receiving Remicade. Autoimmune 
hepatitis has been diagnosed in some of these cases. Severe hepatic reactions occurred 
between 2 weeks to more than a year after initiation of Remicade. Some of these cases 
were fatal or necessitated liver transplantation.
2004 Infliximab More cases of lymphoma observed among patients receiving the agents than 
among control group patients. Malignancies have also been observed in open-label, 
uncontrolled clinical studies at a rate several-fold higher than expected in the general 
population. Patients with Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis, particularly patients 
with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, 
may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the 
development of lymphoma.

tients, performed by Moulis et al., revealed no ex￾cessive risk of malignancy in therapy with any of 
five TNF inhibitors during up to two years of treat￾ment. However, a tendency to an increased rate of 
non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) was found 
[40, 41]. A meta-analysis of observational studies 
by Mariette et al. showed a significantly increased 
risk of developing NMSC as well as melanoma in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with 
TNF inhibitors. However, there was no evidence 
of increased risk of lymphoma between patients 
with RA treated with TNF inhibitors and classic dis￾ease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) [42].
TNF inhibitors were shown to increase the risk 
of non-melanoma skin cancers. The meta-analysis 
published in 2011 and based on 74 trials (includ￾ing only those that lasted at least 4 weeks, but 
with various doses and ways of administration) 
showed a  statistically significant increase in the 
risk of non-melanoma skin cancers [26]. Due to 
the limitations of the analysis that are a result of 
potentially dissimilar conditions of the individu￾al studies, transferability of the results to clinical 
practice may be limited. 
Autoimmune disorders
TNF is considered one of the major players in 
the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS). The evi￾dence includes reports of elevated TNF concentra￾tions in the CSF and serum of MS patients, and in￾creased expression of TNF in MS plaques [43, 44].
Moreover, it has been shown that there is in￾creased secretion of TNF from monocytes shortly 
before the exacerbation of the disease symptoms, 
suggesting the role of TNF in the pathomecha￾nisms of demyelinating disorders [45, 46].
Based on this evidence, the effects of TNF in￾hibitors were investigated in MS patients. Unfor￾tunately, lenercept’s phase II clinical trial had to be 
halted because of the unexpected increase in the 
frequency of MS attacks, accompanied by a ten￾dency for an increase in the duration and severity 
of attacks [47]. Lupus-like symptoms have been 
reported with each of the TNF inhibitors adalim￾umab and infliximab [48–50]. Recently, alopecia 
areata was reported to be associated with treat￾ment with infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept and 
certolizumab [51]. Finally, an increased risk of pso￾riasis was reported in a retrospective cohort study 
of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with TNF 
inhibitors [52]. 
Congestive heart failure
Reports also suggest a  potential risk for con￾gestive heart failure as a  result of treatment 
with TNF inhibitors. However, there are several 
inconsistencies among the individual analyses 
of these particular adverse effects. Namely, one 
retrospective cohort study showed a  statistically 
significant increase in the risk of hospitalization 
due to congestive heart failure in patients treated 
with TNF inhibitors, compared with those treated 
with methotrexate [53]. Conversely, another study 
[54] could not detect any significant differences 
between TNF biologics and other treatments of 
rheumatoid arthritis.
Safety of TNF inhibitors in pregnancy
Thus far, only one study has been published 
concerning the safety of TNF inhibitors during 
pregnancy. No evidence for an increased risk of 
adverse pregnancy outcomes was detected in 
a study describing 131 cases of exposure to inflix￾imab for the treatment of Crohn’s disease during 
pregnancy (104 patients completed the study) 
[55]. There are single reports showing pregnancy 
outcomes of women treated with infliximab and 
etanercept. The anomalies described for inflix￾imab-exposed fetuses included tetralogy of Fallot 
(1 case), intestinal malrotation (1 case), teratoma 
(1 case), and cases of unspecified anomalies of the 
following systems and organs: cardiac (3 cases), 
musculoskeletal (4 cases), reproductive (3 cases), 
eye (2 cases), nervous (1 case) and digestive 
system (1 case). Two cases of fetal anomalies in 
women treated with etanercept included one case 
of trisomy 18 and one case of VACTERL (i.e., ver￾tebral, anal, cardiac, tracheal, esophageal, renal or 
limb anomalies) [56].
Analysis of data on adverse events in pregnant 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with 
anti-TNF therapy collected by the British Society 
for Rheumatology Biologics Register showed an 
association between spontaneous abortion and 
the duration of pregnancy. Moreover, exposure to 
anti-TNF therapy at the time of conception was 
associated with the highest rate of spontaneous 
abortion [57]. However, the data are sparse and, 
although TNF inhibitors are classified as B-cate￾gory drugs (i.e., animal reproduction studies have 
failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and there 
are no adequate and well-controlled studies in 
pregnant women), the potential risk of a harmful 
effect must be kept in mind. 
Future strategies for TNF inhibitors
The spectrum of TNF actions and the extent of 
its roles in pathology of various systems and or￾gans suggest that the indications for its use will 
be expanded in the near future. As TNF exerts 
pleiotropic effects on the CNS, various studies 
have been carried out to examine possible clinical 
applications in models of stoke [58], Parkinson’s 
disease [59] and Alzheimer’s disease [60]. Howev￾er, the problem of undesirable effects that may ac-

company a therapy with TNF inhibitors is still open. 
The quest for means to avoid them has resulted in 
studies leading to the development of second-gen￾eration TNF inhibitors. For example, specific TACE 
inhibitors, which are believed to block formation 
of solTNF and thereby decrease the risk of tubercu￾losis infection and autoimmune reactions, are cur￾rently in pre-clinical and clinical phase II trials [61]. 
Conclusions
Due to the unique role of TNF in the initiation 
and maintenance of inflammatory reactions, TNF 
inhibitors constitute an important and promising 
group of modern drugs with prospects of imple￾mentation in various diseases whose pathogene￾sis is linked to the immune system. The usage in 
approved indications, such as rheumatoid arthri￾tis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spon￾dylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcer￾ative colitis and plaque psoriasis, has confirmed 
their efficacy. Although the therapy is associated 
with undesirable effects, the overall safety profile 
of this class should be considered positive. There 
are many preclinical and clinical data showing 
that TNF inhibitors may also be beneficial in many 
other inflammatory diseases, including CNS disor￾ders. Cases of successful or non-successful usage 
of TNF inhibitors in a  variety of off-label indica￾tions, described in Table IV, indicate the potential 
directions of future studies. Presently, based only 
on current data, it is extremely difficult to specify 
potential new indications. Each disease with an 
established role of TNF in the pathology may be 
a target. Based on pre-clinical research, showing 
the critical role of TNF in the trigeminal system 
[62], temporomandibular disorder or trigeminal 
neuralgia might be of interest for future clinical 
trials on efficacy of TNF inhibitors.
