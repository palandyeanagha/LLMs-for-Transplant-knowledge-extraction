BACKGROUND: Screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can reduce prostate cancer mortality, but may advance diagnosis and
treatment in time and lead to overdetection and overtreatment. We estimated benefits and adverse effects of PSA screening for
individuals who are deciding whether or not to be screened.
METHODS: Using a microsimulation model, we estimated lifetime probabilities of prostate cancer diagnosis and death, overall life
expectancy and expected time to diagnosis, both with and without screening. We calculated anticipated loss in quality of life due to
prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment that would be acceptable to decide in favour of screening.
RESULTS: Men who were screened had a gain in life expectancy of 0.08 years but their expected time to diagnosis decreased by 1.53
life-years. Of the screened men, 0.99% gained on average 8.08 life-years and for 17.43% expected time to diagnosis decreased by
8.78 life-years. These figures imply that the anticipated loss in quality of life owing to diagnosis and treatment should not exceed 4.8%,
for screening to have a positive effect on quality-adjusted life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The decision to be screened should depend on personal preferences. The negative impact of screening might be
reduced by screening men who are more willing to accept the side effects from treatment.

The purpose of screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is to
reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer by finding and
treating prostate cancers at an early stage. The European
Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC)
and the Go¨teborg trial (part of the ERSPC) showed that a reduction
in prostate mortality can be obtained by screening with PSA
(Schroder et al, 2009; Hugosson et al, 2010). However, an adverse
effect of screening is overdiagnosis, i.e., the detection of cancers
that would not have been diagnosed during the patients’ lifetime if
they had not been screened (Welch and Albertsen, 2009). Also, all
men with screen-detected prostate cancer have to live more years
with the knowledge that they have prostate cancer (lead-time).
Men with screen-detected prostate cancer who opt for curative
treatment risk living many years with the side effects of treatment,
which would otherwise be symptom-free years (Korfage et al, 2005;
Heijnsdijk et al, 2009).
Most major US medical organisations (Lim and Sherin, 2008;
Smith et al, 2010; Wolf et al, 2010) and the European Association of
Urology (Heidenreich et al, 2011) recommend that clinicians discuss
the potential benefits and adverse effects of PSA screening with their
clients, consider their clients’ preferences, and individualise screen￾ing decisions. Information on the consequences of PSA screening on
a persons’ life can help in making an informed decision.
This paper presents results of a simulation model showing the
major differences between the potential course of lives of men who
decide to be screened and those of men who decide not to be
screened. We present the lifetime probability of prostate cancer
diagnosis and death, overall life expectancy and expected pre￾diagnosis life-years (the average life-years till the time of prostate
cancer diagnosis) for the two groups. Though several studies have
presented benefits and adverse effects of PSA screening for a
population (Schroder et al, 2009; Welch and Albertsen, 2009;
Hugosson et al, 2010), we present the consequences of screening
from the time of the decision to be screened or not. Also, while in
empirical studies harms and benefits are calculated after a follow￾up time of some years, this study presents results for the whole
lifetime.
Health economists use the concept of utility to express
quantitatively adverse effects of diagnosis and treatment on quality
of life. In this view, life without prostate cancer has utility 1; after
diagnosis and treatment utility decreases to a lower level,
depending on individual preferences and the specific conse￾quences of diagnosis and treatment. Several authors have obtained
estimates of utility or quality of life of living with these
consequences (Steineck et al, 2002; Stewart et al, 2005; Dale
et al, 2008; Carlsson et al, 2011). Although we do not estimate the
utility and quality of life of living with prostate cancer, our results
do allow calculation of the utility level below which the expected
harms of early diagnosis exceed the expected gains from prevented
prostate cancer mortality (the break-even point), which can be
compared with individual expectations.

METHODS
We used the MISCAN (MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis)
prostate cancer model. MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis is a
microsimulation programme that simulates the progression and
screening of prostate cancer. The model was validated on prostate
cancer detection data from the ERSPC Rotterdam (Draisma et al,
2003, 2006; Wever et al, 2010) and the ERSPC Go¨teborg (Hugosson
et al, 2004), and on the mortality reduction data from the overall
ERSPC trial (Schroder et al, 2009; Wever et al, 2011). The
assumptions of the model and the estimation of the parameters are
explained next in this section. For this analysis a cohort model was
used, with the age of first screening distributed uniformly from age
50 to 70 and with subsequent screening until age 75. The lifetime
risks of prostate cancer diagnosis and death were calculated for the
situation in which there was no screening and that with annual
screening.
MISCAN model
A detailed description of the model and the data sources that
informed the quantification of the model can be found in previous
studies (Draisma et al, 2003, 2006; Wever et al, 2010, 2011) and
also in a standardised model profile: http://cisnet.cancer.gov/
prostate/profiles.html. MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis is a
microsimulation programme that simulates the progression of
prostate cancer in individuals as a sequence of preclinical, clinical
and screen-detected tumour states. First, the age at death from
other causes is simulated per individual using Dutch life
tables (Statistics Netherlands, 2000–2007). Next, the progression
of prostate cancer in the absence of screening is simulated.
Prostate cancer may develop from no prostate cancer to a clinically
diagnosed cancer through one or more screen-detectable pre￾clinical stages. From each preclinical stage, a tumour may grow to
the next clinical T-stage (T1, impalpable; T2, palpable, confined to
the prostate; T3 þ , palpable, with extensions beyond the prostatic
capsule); it may dedifferentiate to a higher Gleason score (well
differentiated, Gleason score 2–6; moderately differentiated,
Gleason score 7; poorly differentiated and Gleason score 8–10);
or it may be clinically diagnosed. For these transitions, the time
spent in the current stage is generated from a Weibull distribution,
where the parameters depend on the current stage and the choice
of next stage is determined by transition probabilities. In addition,
there is a risk that a tumour in the local regional stage (M0) will
develop into disseminated disease (M1), which is modelled by
using a stage and Gleason score-specific hazard function.
Depending on the frequency and sensitivity of the screening test,
preclinical cancers may be detected by screening. Prostate-specific
antigen test and subsequent biopsy were modelled as a single test,
where the sensitivity parameter was assumed to be clinical T-stage
dependent. In the model, sensitivity is defined as the probability
that a preclinical tumour is detected by a screening test at the time
the test is taken.
Model parameters, including transition probabilities, mean
dwelling times (the time from one preclinical state to another
preclinical or clinical state) and stage-specific test sensitivities
were estimated by constructing models for the ERSPC-Rotterdam
and Go¨teborg, and by calibrating the model to the following data
observed at these centres: baseline incidence (National Cancer
Registry data for 1991 (Visser et al, 1994)) and stage distribution
in the Netherlands (Rotterdam cancer registry data 1992–1993
(Spapen et al, 2000)); baseline incidence in Sweden (1988–1992
(Parkin et al, 1997)); incidence, Gleason and stage distributions in
the control arms of ERSPC-Rotterdam and Go¨teborg; and
detection rates, interval cancer rates, Gleason and stage distribu￾tions in the screen arms of ERSPC-Rotterdam (Draisma et al, 2003,
2006; Wever et al, 2010) and Go¨teborg (Hugosson et al, 2004).
Number of cases diagnosed, and Gleason and stage distributions in
the control arms vs those in the screen arms provide insight into
disease progression through the various preclinical phases.
Parameters were estimated by numerically minimising the
deviance between the number of cases observed and the number
of cases predicted by the models. Deviances were calculated by
assuming the Poisson likelihood for incidence data and by
assuming multinomial likelihood for stage distribution data. The
parameters for incidence, clinical diagnosis and sensitivity were
assumed to be country-specific. For the main results in this
analysis we used the country-specific parameters corresponding to
the Netherlands. The cohort models used for the analysis were
constructed by changing the screening protocol of the ERSPC￾Rotterdam model to the screening protocols considered in this
study.
We assumed that if men are clinically diagnosed with prostate
cancer, the time to death from prostate cancer is determined by
prostate cancer-specific survival curves. Survival curves for men
with no initial treatment were estimated on the basis of SEER
(Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) data, specifically on
cases diagnosed in the pre-PSA era (1983–1986). We assumed that
all men diagnosed with prostate cancer receive radical prostatect￾omy. According to the results of (Bill-Axelson et al, 2011), we
assumed that men receiving radical prostatectomy have a relative
risk of 0.62 of dying from prostate cancer compared with men
receiving no initial treatment. This analysis did not consider other
treatments, such as radiation therapy and active surveillance,
because of the limited published results about the effectiveness of
these treatments. If the effectiveness of radiation therapy and
active surveillance are different than that of radical prostatectomy,
the results for these treatments will be different than those
presented. For distant prostate cancer, we assumed that treatment
has no effect. Some treatments might increase survival of distant
disease slightly. However, in our view this is a minor limitation of
the model.
The effect of early detection through screening on survival was
included by assuming that a fraction of local-regional tumours
detected by screening are cured because the tumours are treated
earlier. The Gleason score-dependent cure rates were estimated by
calibrating the ERSPC-Rotterdam model to the observed 27%
prostate cancer mortality reduction in the overall ERSPC at follow￾up after 9 years (Wever et al, 2011).
Calculating utility break-even point
We assigned being alive without diagnosed prostate cancer a
utility of one, being dead a utility of zero, and being alive with
diagnosed and treated prostate cancer a utility of u. The utility
break-even point is the value of the utility of living with diagnosed
and treated prostate cancer, u, for which the expected quality
of life lost due to earlier detection and treatment of cancer is
equal to the expected quality-adjusted life expectancy gained
(Figure 1). Therefore, men who can judge that their reduction
in quality of life in the event that they are diagnosed and treated
for prostate cancer exceeds the reduction that is represented
by this threshold utility should possibly refrain from screening
participation.
Sensitivity analyses
To evaluate the statistical variation and uncertainty of the
observed data, we conducted a number of sensitivity analyses.
The sensitivity analyses compared models with various lead-times,
incidence, survival curves and cure rates. Penalised optimisation
was used to obtain a range of models with various lead-times.
Parameters for these models were estimated by minimising the
sum of total deviance and lead-time penalty (mean lead-time 
penalty). The penalties used were 100 (favoring long lead￾times), 0 and 100 (favoring short lead-times). We varied incidence

in the models by using estimated incidence parameters that
reproduced incidence in the Netherlands or Sweden. Different
survivals were considered by assuming a relative risk of 0.5, 1 or 2
on the hazard of prostate cancer death. The various cure rates
were obtained by calibrating the ERSPC-Rotterdam model to a
mortality reduction of 27% (observed for attendees in ERSPC),
44% (observed for the screen group in ERSPC-Go¨teborg) or 56%
(observed for attendees in ERSPC-Go¨teborg).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows predicted risks of prostate cancer diagnosis and
death and life expectancies for men aged 50–54, 55–59, 60–64 and
65–69, both when deciding to participate in screening or not. As an
illustration, consider men in the 55–59 age group. Men who had
not been screened had a 14.44% lifetime risk of being diagnosed
with prostate cancer and a 2.94% lifetime risk of dying from it. Life
expectancy was 22.31 years, 21.08 of which pre-diagnosis. By
comparison, those who participated in a yearly screening
programme had a 21.54% lifetime risk of being diagnosed with
prostate cancer, a 1.89% risk of dying from prostate cancer and a
life expectancy of 22.40 years, 19.47 of which pre-diagnosis.
Therefore, men screened annually increased their life expectancy
by 0.09 years, i.e., 33 days. However, because of the lead-time
inherent in screen detection their expected pre-diagnosis life-years
decreased by 1.61 years, i.e., 588 days.
Though the 0.09 expected gain in life-years appears small, this is
a weighted average of all men who were screened. Among men who
were screened, a fraction of 1.05% ( ¼ 2.94–1.89%) did not die of
prostate cancer because the cancer was detected and treated earlier
(Table 2). Life expectancy among these men increased by 8.57
years ( ¼ 0.09  100/1.05). The expected loss of 1.61 pre-diagnosis
life-years is also a weighted average. Among men who were
screened, 17.73% were screen-detected with prostate cancer. Their
expected pre-diagnosis life-years decreased by 9.08 years
( ¼ 1.61  100/17.73).
Figure 2 presents the probability of being alive without
diagnosed prostate cancer, alive with diagnosed prostate cancer,
dead from prostate cancer, and dead from other causes at various
points in time, from the time of the decision to be screened or not,
and how these probabilities were affected by the decision. Patients
in the health state alive with diagnosed prostate could be cured of
their disease or not. This health state is a transient state that
eventually will be absorbed by the state dead from prostate cancer
or dead from other causes. The figures show that although
screening reduced the probability of dying from prostate cancer in
the long term, it substantially increased the probability of being
alive with diagnosed prostate cancer in the short term. This pattern

the decision to participate in screening or not does not affect expected
quality-adjusted life-years. The utility break-even point is the utility level
corresponding to that situation.

The utility break-even point is the value of the utility of living with diagnosed prostate cancer for which the utility￾adjusted life expectancy does not change upon deciding to participate in screening or not. Its value decreases with larger gains in overall life expectancy relative to the expected
loss in pre-diagnosis life-years. A high value of the utility break-even point means that men should only decide in favour of screening when they anticipate a small loss in quality of
life owing to detection and possibly treatment of prostate cancer.

is especially clear in older ages, who have a higher probability of
having a preclinical prostate cancer, which is screen-detectable.
For younger ages, too, screening substantially increased the
probability of being alive with diagnosed prostate cancer, though
in their case this increase was more widely distributed over the
follow-up years.
Table 1 and Figure 2 can be used by clinicians and individuals to
discuss the short- and long-term benefits and harms that apply to
the average individual. To summarise the harms and benefits in
one measure we calculated the utility break-even point. The utility
break-even points were high (0.947–0.960) for all ages. These
utility break-even points imply that men who might judge, based
on information given, that their quality of life will decrease by
44.0–5.3% in the event that they are diagnosed and treated for
prostate cancer should probably avoid being screened. It is
important to note that the utility break-even points are estimated
clinical outcomes from a population that applies to average
individuals.
Varying lead-time, incidence, survival and cure rates caused the
decrease in expected pre-diagnosis life-years to vary from 1.40 to
2.31 years, the increase in life expectancy to vary from 0.02 to 0.40
years and the utility break-even point to vary from 0.833 to 0.991
(Table 3). Shorter lead-times, more negative survival and higher
cure rates yielded results more in favour of screening. Although
the loss in quality of life acceptable for a man to consider screening
was only 0.9% in the most unfavourable model for screening, the
most favourable model showed a 16.7% loss as still being
acceptable.
DISCUSSION
The analysis showed that if an individual decides to be screened,
his lifetime risk of prostate cancer death decreased from 2.86 to
1.87%, while his overall life expectancy increased by 0.08 years. At
the same time, his lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate
cancer increased from 14.10 to 21.31% and his expected pre￾diagnosis life-years decreased by 1.53 years. A fractional percen￾tage of 0.99% of screened men enjoyed a benefit of living an
average of 8.08 years longer, whereas 17.43% of the screened men
were screen-detected and lived an average of 8.78 pre-diagnosis
life-years less. In many cases this means an increase in life-years
suffering from morbidity associated with treatment (Potosky et al,
2000; Korfage et al, 2005).
Albertsen et al (2005, 2011) estimated risks of death from
prostate cancer as a function of grade and age for prostate cancer
left untreated (not treated curatively). His curves show that the risk
of dying from prostate cancer is high for high-grade cancer only.
His estimates are relevant for men diagnosed with prostate cancer
who have to decide on treatment. Similarly, Figure 2 provides
information that could be relevant for men deciding to be screened
or not. It shows that screening reduces a small risk of dying from
prostate cancer in the future, at the cost of substantial increased
risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer in the short term.

The high utility break-even points (0.947–0.960) in this analysis
imply that only a small anticipated loss in quality of life after
diagnosing and treating prostate cancer would be acceptable for
deciding in favour of screening. As individuals assess the side
effects of treatment very differently (Steineck et al, 2002; Korfage
et al, 2006) the anticipated loss in quality of life might vary
considerably between individuals. Some patients might find it very
important to be potent or continent, for example, because they
have an active life that they really want to maintain. Assume a scale
from 0 to 100, where 100 implies that the individual would not
mind at all to have sexual problems and 0 implies that the
individual would mind very much. An individual whose value is 70
has an expected utility of 0.75 ( ¼ 1  12/(100–31) þ 0.70  57/
(100–31)) in the event that he is diagnosed and treated for prostate
cancer and therefore an anticipated loss in quality of life of 25%.
This calculation is based on the results of (Korfage et al, 2005) who
presented that 31% of men had erectile dysfunction before radical
prostatectomy and 88% after radical prostatectomy. In this case,
the anticipated loss in quality of life after a prostate cancer
diagnosis and treatment will be higher than the utility break-even
point and therefore the individual should refrain from screening
participation. Other patients might find it less important to be
potent or continent, which could mean that the anticipated loss in
quality of life is lower than the utility break-even point and that
therefore the individual should decide to be screened.
Considering the utility break-even point one should, however,
acknowledge that expected utility theory is not always a good
predictor of patient’s actual decisions. Just as with insurance
against fire, where the costs are much higher than the expected
benefits, people may deem the adverse effects to be acceptable in
exchange for the benefits received, while this might not be the case
according to expected utility theory. Also, while it is already
difficult to assess the loss in quality of life for individuals who are
diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer (Essink-Bot et al, 2003),
it is probably even more difficult to assess the anticipated loss in
quality of life for individuals who are not even screened yet.
Therefore, it might be difficult to use the utility break-even points.
To be able to use the utility break-even point a formal decision aid
should be constructed, which explains the possible side effects of
diagnosis and treatment, and which can provide a value for the
anticipated loss in quality of life for each individual. For this
decision aid published data (Korfage et al, 2005; Stewart et al,
2005; Carlsson et al, 2011) for the risks of the potential side effects
of treatment of prostate cancer can be used.

Results are presented for men who were first screened at age 55–59. b
We used penalised optimisation to obtain a range of models with different lead-times (Draisma et al,
2003). c
We varied the incidence in the model by using the estimated incidence parameters that reproduced the incidence in the Netherlands or Sweden. d
A relative risk of 0.5
on the hazard of prostate cancer death increases prostate cancer-specific survival and a relative risk of 2 on the hazard of prostate cancer death decreases prostate cancer-specific
survival. e
The cure rates show the proportion of screen-detected men who do not die of pc because their cancer is diagnosed and treated earlier. The cure rates were obtained
by calibrating the ERSPC-Rotterdam model to a 10, 27 or 56% mortality reduction. The first cure rates are for men screen-detected for pc with the Gleason score p7 and the
second cure rates are for men screen-detected for pc with the Gleason score 47. f
The utility break-even point is the value of the utility of living with diagnosed prostate cancer
for which the utility-adjusted life expectancy does not change upon deciding to participate in screening or not. Its value decreases with larger gains in overall life expectancy
relative to the expected loss in prostate-cancer-free life expectancy. A high value of the utility break-even point means that men should only decide in favour of screening when
they anticipate a small loss in quality of life owing to detection and possibly treatment of prostate cancer.

Clinical Studies

Another limitation of our study is that the results were calculated
using data from a specific population, namely the ERSPC Rotterdam
and Go¨teborg. The results may be different for other populations, as
different incidences of and mortalities for prostate cancer have been
observed in different countries (Ferlay et al, 2010). The sensitivity
analyses give an indication of the expected impact on the results for
populations with different incidence, survival and cure rates. In
Sweden, prostate cancer accounts for 5.5% of all causes of deaths
among men (The National Board of Health and Welfare, 2009) and the
mortality reduction observed in the Go¨teborg trial was 56%, among
attendees; the expected impact for the Swedish population is therefore
comparable to the results of the most favourable model for screening.
In the United States, the estimated lifetime risk of prostate cancer
diagnosis is 16.22% and of prostate cancer death is 2.79% (SEER,
2010), which are close to the main results presented. Therefore, the
main results might also be applied in the US population.
The results of this analysis apply to the average population. In
this study, we did not do subgroup analyses. However, there might
be factors, for example, family history with prostate cancer, obesity
and African-American race that imply an increased risk of prostate
cancer. Men with these risk factors might have different results for
the benefits and harms.
The third limitation is that we used survival curves based on
data observed in the United States for the ERSPC-Rotterdam
population modelled. We used these survival data as it is one of the
few data sets presenting survival of untreated prostate cancer as a
function of age at diagnosis and Gleason score progression.
However, for our main results we estimated a 2.86% lifetime risk of
prostate cancer death, which corresponds well with US (SEER,
2010) and Dutch data (CBS, 2010).
The fourth limitation is that we did not consider the different
treatments available, as there are limited published results about
the effectiveness of all treatments. For the purposes of this analysis,
we assumed that all individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer
received radical prostatectomy. If the effectiveness of active
surveillance, radiation therapy or other treatments (e.g., proton
beam and brachytherapy) are different than that of radical
prostatectomy, the benefits for these treatments will be different
than those presented. Also, these might have different potential
side effects, which should be taken into account when determining
the anticipated loss in quality of life.
If active surveillance is considered an option, treatment might
be delayed. This implies that the benefit of screening might be
reduced as immediate curative treatment should be at least as
effective as delayed curative treatment. In the sensitivity analysis,
we considered a scenario where the benefit of screening is reduced
(assuming a prostate cancer mortality reduction of 10% instead of
27% for screened men). The results for this scenario show the
impact on the benefit of screening (0.03 vs 0.09 life-years gained,
Table 2) if screening followed by active surveillance would achieve
a mortality reduction of 10%. However, as the effectiveness of
active surveillance is not known it is not possible to calculate the
exact benefits. As with active surveillance the side effects of
treatment are postponed the anticipated loss in quality of life will
also be lower for the individual.
To evaluate the statistical variation and the uncertainty of the
observed data, we performed sensitivity analyses. The models with
different lead-times show the statistical variation in the model as
we used penalised optimisation to obtain the parameters for these
models. The models with different survival curves show the results
for populations with worse or better prostate cancer survival. As in
the different centres of the ERSPC different prostate cancer mortality
reductions has been observed we considered different cure rate esti￾mates. The analysis shows that in populations with worse prostate
cancer prognosis and higher cure rates 16.7% loss in quality of
life is still acceptable for an individual to decide in favour of
screening, which is quite higher than the 5.1% in the basecase.
After a median follow-up of 9 years, the ERSPC-trial stated that
the prevention of one prostate cancer death entailed the screening
of 1410 men (NNS (number needed to screen)), and the additional
diagnosis of 48 men (NNT (number needed to treat); Schroder
et al, 2009). At 14 years of follow-up, the Go¨teborg-trial showed
that the NNS was 293, and the NNT 12 (Hugosson et al, 2010).
Welch and Albertsen (2009) showed that, in the US population in
the 1986–2005 period, the NNT was maximally 23. Using the lifetime
risk of prostate cancer diagnosis and death in this study, the average
NNS was 101.01 ( ¼ 100/(2.86  1.87)) and the average NNT was
7.28 (¼ (21.31 14.10)/(2.86 1.87)). This illustrates the importance
of complete follow-up for correctly estimating these quantities.
In conclusion, the results of the present analysis show that
individuals who decide to be screened may lower their risk of
dying from prostate cancer and live longer, but also that the
associated adverse effects can be significant. However, the
magnitude of the adverse effects depends on how undesirable it
is for the individual to live with diagnosed and treated prostate
cancer and the potential side effects. The negative impact of
screening might be reduced by screening men who are more
willing to accept the side effects from treatment.
