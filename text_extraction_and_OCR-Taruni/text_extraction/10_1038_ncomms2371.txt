In eukaryotes, hydrogen sulphide acts as a signalling molecule and cytoprotectant. Hydrogen
sulphide is known to be produced from L-cysteine by cystathionine b-synthase, cystathionine
g-lyase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase coupled with cysteine aminotransferase.
Here we report an additional biosynthetic pathway for the production of hydrogen sulphide
from D-cysteine involving 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and D-amino acid oxidase.
Unlike the L-cysteine pathway, this D-cysteine-dependent pathway operates predominantly in
the cerebellum and the kidney. Our study reveals that administration of D-cysteine protects
primary cultures of cerebellar neurons from oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide
and attenuates ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the kidney more than L-cysteine. This study
presents a novel pathway of hydrogen sulphide production and provides a new therapeutic
approach to deliver hydrogen sulphide to specific tissues.

Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) modulates synaptic activity by
enhancing the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
in neurons and by activating astrocytes that surround the
synapse1,2. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by activating K þ
channels and regulates the release of insulin3–7. In addition to its
function as a signalling molecule, H2S has a cytoprotective effect.
It protects neurons from oxidative stress by recovering
glutathione levels, scavenging ROS and suppressing intracellular
Ca2 þ concentrations8,9. This finding led to the identification of
H2S-mediated cardio- and renal-protection from ischaemia￾reperfusion injury10,11.
Most studies about the production of H2S have been
concentrated on two pyridoxal 50
-phospate-dependent enzymes,
cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine g-lyase
(CSE)1,3,12,13. Recently, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase
(3MST)/cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) pathway has
emerged as the third pathway. 3MST produces H2S from
3-mercaptopyruvate (3MP), which is generated by CAT from
L-cysteine and a-ketoglutarate (a-KG) in the presence of the
cofactors thioredoxin and dihydrolipoic acid14–16. D-Amino acid
oxidase (DAO) can also produce achiral a-keto acids, including
3MP, from D-amino acids, some of which are found in
mammalian tissues17–19.
DAO is localized to peroxisomes, whereas 3MST is mainly
found in mitochondria14,20. Mitochondria and peroxisomes,
which are essential cellular organelles in mammals, exchange
various metabolites as well as enzymes via a specific form of
vesicular trafficking, and are usually in close proximity to each
other or have physical contact21. 3MST along with DAO can
produce H2S by the interaction of both organelles.
The present study identifies a novel pathway for H2S
production from D-cysteine and its cytoprotective role in the
cerebellum and the kidney.
Results
H2S production from D-cysteine. When we examined the pro￾duction of H2S from brain homogenates, we found that H2S was
produced from D-cysteine, a negative control for L-cysteine
(Fig. 1a). Although H2S is produced from D-cysteine in micro￾organisms and plants22, its production in mammals is not well
understood. Therefore, we compared the catabolism of D-cysteine
with that of L-cysteine. The production of H2S from D-cysteine
was optimal at pH 7.4, whereas production from L-cysteine was
greatest at pH 8.4 (Fig. 1b). Next, we examined the PLP￾dependent nature of the reaction because H2S production from
L-cysteine by 3MST/CAT and CBS depends on PLP1,14,15. Our
results revealed that hydroxylamine, which is an inhibitor of PLP￾dependent enzymes, did not have an effect on H2S production
from D-cysteine except for at 0.5 mM (Fig. 1c). At 0.5 mM the
production of H2S from D-cysteine was increased probably due
to the decrease in the competition for D-cysteine with
PLP-dependent enzymes, which were greatly suppressed at
0.5 mM. However, at 5 mM, pH of the medium was shifted
to acidic, which suppressed H2S production from D-cysteine.
A single freeze-thaw cycle differently affected enzymatic activity
of the two pathways. Specifically, the H2S production from
D-cysteine was greatly increased, whereas L-cysteine catabolism
was decreased (Fig. 1d). These observations suggest that the
H2S-producing pathway from D-cysteine is independent of PLP
and distinct from the pathways involving L-cysteine.
The DAO-3MST pathway produces H2S from D-cysteine. We
subsequently determined the subcellular localization of the
activity to identify the specific pathway involved in the produc￾tion of H2S from D-cysteine. We concluded that B70% of the
H2S-producing activity was localized to the mitochondrial frac￾tion, which includes peroxisomes as well as mitochondria
(Fig. 1e). As mitochondrial 3MST produces H2S from 3MP, the
existence of an enzyme that produces 3MP from D-cysteine was
predicted. It has been previously proposed in hepatocytes that
DAO produces 3MP (Fig. 1f)19. Indeed, 3MP was produced from
D-cysteine in the presence of the mitochondrial fraction, and the
production was suppressed by the DAO inhibitor indole-2-
carboxylate (I2CA) (Fig. 1g,h)23. Although 3MP was also
produced from L-cysteine with a-KG or L-cysteine alone to a
lesser extent, the production was not suppressed by I2CA. In
addition, H2S production from D-cysteine was suppressed by
I2CA, whereas that from 3MP was not (Fig. 1i). These
observations suggest that DAO uses D-cysteine to produce 3MP,
which is in turn metabolized to H2S by 3MST.
We next utilized recombinant 3MST and DAO to confirm the
production of H2S via the 3MST/DAO pathway. The results
with the recombinant proteins mimicked the endo￾genous results obtained with the mitochondrial fraction
(Supplementary Fig. S1), confirming that the 3MST/DAO
pathway produces H2S from D-cysteine.
Tissue localization of DAO and 3MST. Subsequently, the tissue
localization of DAO and 3MST was examined by western blot
analysis. DAO mostly localized to the cerebellum and the kidney,
and 3MST was also found in both tissues (Fig. 2a–d). We next
examined whether the production of H2S from D-cysteine
correlated with the localization of DAO and 3MST. Indeed, H2S
was mainly produced from D-cysteine in the cerebellum and
kidney homogenates (Fig. 2e,f). These observations suggest that
H2S is mainly produced by the 3MST/DAO pathway from
D-cysteine in the cerebellum and the kidney.
The production of H2S by isolated mitochondria and
peroxisomes from D-cysteine was examined. The isolated cere￾bellar mitocondria and peroxisomes produced H2S from
D-cysteine. As mitochondria contain CAT, the isolated mito￾chondria produced H2S from L-cysteine along with a-KG
(Supplementary Fig. S2a,c). H2S production from D-cysteine was
greater than from L-cysteine along with a-KG in the presence
of the isolated kidney mitochondria and peroxisomes
(Supplementary Fig. S2b,c). H2S production from L-cysteine alone
was undetectable in the presence of isolated mitochondrial and
peroxisomes of both tissues.
Developmental changes in H2S production. We then examined
the production of H2S from D-cysteine and L-cysteine and the
expression of 3MST and DAO in the cerebellum and the kidney
during development. In the cerebellum, the levels of DAO
increased from birth until the mice were 8 weeks old, while the
3MST levels were relatively high at birth and only slightly
decreased after 8 weeks (Fig. 2g). H2S production from D-cysteine
increased over time, reaching the maximum production after
6 weeks, and then, it decreased, whereas H2S production from
L-cysteine was much less and did not significantly vary over time
(Fig. 2i). Similar results were obtained in the kidney (Fig. 2h,j).
These observations suggest that the altered production of H2S
from D-cysteine observed during development correlates well with
the levels of DAO and 3MST, both in the cerebellum and the
kidney.
Increase in bound sulfane sulphur by D-cysteine administra￾tion. Bound sulfane sulphur is the major physiologically relevant
pool of H2S capable of regulating enzyme activity and cell
growth24. As H2S produced from L-cysteine is stored as bound
sulfane sulphur14, H2S produced from D-cysteine may also be

stored. To examine this possibility, we orally administered
D-cysteine to mice and measured the amount of bound sulfane
sulphur in the cerebellum, cerebrum and kidney. The levels of
bound sulfane sulphur in the cerebellum increased by 212%
compared with the control 0.5 h after the administration of
D-cysteine, and returned to the control level after 3 h;
comparatively, L-cysteine did not significantly increase the levels
of bound sulfane sulphur (Fig. 3a). Neither D-cysteine nor
L-cysteine affected the cerebrum (Fig. 3b). D-Cysteine increased
the levels of bound sulfane sulphur in the kidney by 236%, 218%
and 196% at 0.5, 3 and 6 h after administration, respectively.
L-Cysteine increased the levels by 172% after 0.5 h, but they
immediately declined thereafter (Fig. 3c). These observations
suggest that D-cysteine more efficiently increased the levels of
bound sulfane sulphur than L-cysteine in the cerebellum and the
kidney.
D-cysteine protects neurons from oxidative stress. As H2S
protects neurons from oxidative stress8,9, we examined whether
D-cysteine protects cultures of cerebellar neurons from
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress caused
using 4-3-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-
tetrazolio-1,3-benzene disulfonate sodium salt (WST-8)
assay, a tetrazolium salt, which is reduced by cellular activity to
form intensely coloured formazans, and have often used to
quantitate the number of living cells. Fifty micromolar H2O2
caused B60% neuronal cell death 21 h after the application. The
simultaneous application of D-cysteine with H2O2-protected
neurons from H2O2-induced toxicity in a concentration￾dependent manner (Fig. 3d). Both D- and L-cysteine at 1 mM
increased the viability above 200% of a control. The oxidized
form of D-cysteine, D-cystine, protected neurons greater than
L-cystine, which is a major form in the extracellular fluid such as
blood (Fig. 3e).
D-cysteine protects the kidney from ischaemia-reperfusion
injury. We also examined the effect of D-cysteine on ischaemia￾reperfusion injury in the kidney. The staining with 2, 3, 5-tri￾phenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), which is another tetrazolium
salt, showed that the cortex was stained in mice orally adminis￾tered D-cysteine, while it was not stained 24 h after ischaemia￾reperfusion in control mice, suggesting that D-cysteine protects

the renal cortex (Fig. 3f). TTC staining in the renal cortex in mice
administered D-cysteine was greater than that in mice adminis￾tered L-cysteine, suggesting that D-cysteine protects the renal
cortex more efficiently than L-cysteine does.
These observations were confirmed by Periodic-Acid-Schiff
staining. The structure of the renal cortex was disintegrated after
ischaemia-reperfusion (Fig. 3g). In contrast, it was well preserved
in mice administered D-cysteine. The structure of glomeruli
showed a significant difference from that of a control. In mice
administered L-cysteine, glomeruli were shrunk and a wide space
was observed between glomerulus and the surrounding capsule
(Fig. 3g). These observations suggest that D-cysteine increases
the levels of bound sulfane sulphur to protect the kidney from the
ischaemia-reperfusion injury more efficiently than L-cysteine
(Fig. 3c,g). Serum creatinine levels, which are increased by renal
injury, were measured after the ischaemia-reperfusion of uni￾lateral kidney. The ischaemia-reperfusion significantly increased
serum creatinine, and D-cysteine decreased the level of serum
creatinine more efficiently than L-cysteine but the difference was
not statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Sources of D-cysteine. There are at least two possible sources of
D-cysteine, namely, racemase-induced chiral change of L-cysteine
and absorption from food. As cysteine is structurally similar to
serine with an OH replaced by an SH, and because aspartate
racemase is homologous to CAT, which has an affinity for both
aspartate and cysteine25–27, it is possible that serine racemase or
aspartate racemase changes L-cysteine to D-cysteine. However, we
determined that neither recombinant racemase was capable of
this conversion (Supplementary Fig. S4).
We also examined the racemase activity in the brain. The
cerebellar homogenates produced a substance from L-cysteine
detected at a retention time of 6.98 min after 30 min, and the peak

was shifted to 6.93 min after 60-min incubation (Supplementary
Fig. S5b,c). However, considering the difference in the retention
time, we determined that neither peak was identical to D-cysteine
(6.34 min), (Supplementary Fig. S5e).
Discussion
L-Amino acids are nonenzymatically racemized by heat and
alkaline conditions applied during food processing, and 21–44%
of L-cysteine is changed to D-cysteine by alkaline treatment28,29.
D-cysteine may thus be mostly provided from food. Although
D-cysteine was not detected in tissues after the oral administra￾tion, the levels of bound sulfane sulphur were increased to protect
the kidney from ischaemia-reperfusion injury (Fig. 3). These
observations with the previous finding that D-cysteine is easily
absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and enters the blood
stream30 suggest that D-cysteine may be immediately metabolized
to produce bound sulfane sulphur in tissues.
Both D-cysteine and L-cysteine protect cerebellar neurons from
oxidative stress, and further increase cell viability at the higher
concentrations (Fig. 3d). Our previous study similarly showed
that H2S specifically increased cell viability of neuronal cells31.
D-Cystine protected cerebellar neurons more efficiently than
L-cystine (Fig. 3e). It is probably because the transport activity for
D-cystine is greater than that for L-cystine when compared at the
same concentrations32.
D-cysteine protects the renal cortex more efficiently than
L-cysteine (Fig. 3f,g). As H2S-producing enzymes, CBS, CSE and
3MST along with DAO are localized to the renal cortex33–36, the
administration of D-cysteine or L-cysteine protects the renal
cortex but not the medulla (Fig. 3f,g). D-cysteine, which increases
the levels of bound sulfane sulphur more greatly than L-cysteine,
more efficiently protects the renal cortex than L-cysteine does
(Fig. 3f,g). The observation also confirms the interaction between
mitochondrial 3MST and peroxisomal DAO in vivo.
L-Cysteine is an excitotoxin comparable in potency to other
excitatory amino acids37. In contrast, the subcutaneous
administration of D-cysteine does not cause excitotoxic damage
to the brain38. Therefore, systemic application of D-cysteine may
be less toxic than that of L-cysteine. The administration of
D-cysteine may provide a new therapeutic approach to protect
specific cells from oxidative stress or ischaemia-reperfusion injury
through its conversion to H2S via a novel pathway with 3MST
and DAO.

Methods
Determination of H2S-producing activity. All animal procedures were approved
by the National Institute of Neuroscience Animal Care Use Committee. Whole￾brain extracts were prepared from male C57BL/6N mice (Clea Japan, Tokyo,
Japan) with nine volumes of ice-cold buffer A (100 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and a complete protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)) by using a Potter-type glass
homogenizer with a Teflon pestle or a Polytron-type homogenizer. To examine the
stability of the enzymes following a single freeze-thaw cycle, the whole brain was
immediately frozen at  80 1C after excision and thawed on ice. The extracts of the
frozen-and-thawed tissue were prepared as described above. Enzymatic production
of H2S was measured by following our previously described method10.
Subcellular fractionation. Whole-mouse brains were homogenized with three
volumes of the fractionation buffer (5 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.1% ethanol and protease inhibitor cocktail) by using a Potter-type glass
homogenizer with a Teflon pestle (1,200 r.p.m., three strokes) and centrifuged at
1,000 g for 10 min. The pellet was rehomogenized as described above and cen￾trifuged twice at 600 g for 10 min. The final pellet was recovered as a nuclear
fraction that was resuspended in fractionation buffer at 10% of the original volume.
The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 16,500 g for 30 min to obtain the
cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. The mitochondrial pellets were resuspended
in a volume of fractionation buffer equivalent to the supernatant.
Determination of 3MP. The mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 10% of the
original volume with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and a complete
protease inhibitor cocktail. For the enzyme reactions, 11 ml of D-cysteine was added
to 0.1 ml of the mitochondrial fraction to the final concentrations indicated in the
figure legend and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 1C for 50 min. The thiol
group of 3MP is highly reactive and can form dimers in multiple combinations
through interactions with itself and other thiols39. To block the reactivity, an equal
volume of 0.1 M N-ethylmaleimide, which is a thiol-alkylating agent, was added to
the mixture and incubated at 37 1C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 g for
10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged through Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters
(Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a cutoff of 3 kDa. The alkylated 3MP in the filtrate
was determined by the pre-labelling high-performance liquid chromatography
assay using 1,2-diamino-4,5-dimethoxybenzene40.
Western blot analysis. The protein samples (10 mg) were fractionated by SDS–
PAGE on a 12 or 15% polyacrylamide gel (DRC, Tokyo, Japan) and transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked by
using PBS-T (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 and
0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% skim milk (Wako, Osaka, Japan) overnight at 4 1C
and incubated with either anti-MPST (1:3,000; Atlas Antibodies AB, Stockholm,
Sweden) or anti-DAO41 (BioResource room, The Institute for Enzyme Research,
The University of Tokushima) at 4 1C for 4 h. After additional 2-h incubation with
the secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
diluted at 1:20,000 (GE Healthcare), the binding of the antibodies was visualized
using the Millipore Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate
(Millipore) or Western Lightning ECL Pro (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).
Cell culture. Primary cerebellar neurons were prepared from embryonic day 16
imprinting control region (ICR) mice (Clea Japan). The cerebellum was digested
with 0.25% trypsine and 0.1% DNase I in Ca2 þ /Mg2 þ -free PBS for 10 min at
37 1C. After pipetting cells were seeded on poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well microtiter
dishes at 100,000 cells per 100 ml in each well. The cells were cultured in Neurobasal
medium (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with B27, 0.5 mM
L-glutamine, 100 U ml  1 penicillin and 100 mg ml  1 streptomycin at 37 1C in 10%
CO2. For the toxicity study, 5-day-old cells were exposed to 50 mM H2O2, and then
cysteine or cystine was added to the concentrations indicated in the figure legend.
WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-
2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) viability assay was performed with the cell￾counting kit-8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) 21 h after the application of H2O2.
Ten microliters of WST-8 was added to each well, cells were incubated at 37 1C for
2 h and absorption values at 450 nm were determined using a microplate reader.
Values of samples were normalized by subtracting values of direct reduction of
WST-8 by the chemicals.
Administration of cysteine. Male ICR mice (Clea Japan) with a body weight of
30–40 g were housed with ad libitum access to food and water. The animals were
divided into three groups: D-cysteine, L-cysteine and control. The D- and L-cysteine
(8 mmol kg  1 body weight) were orally administered by gastric intubation. The
cysteine solution was adjusted to pH 2.0–2.5 with 5 M NaOH. The control mice
received the same amount of NaCl. At the times indicated in the figure legend after
oral administration, the mice were transcardially perfused with saline. The tissues
were immediately removed, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then stored at  80 1C
until the bound sulfane sulphur was measured.
Determination of bound sulfane sulphur. To determine the amount of bound
sulfane sulphur, the frozen tissues were thawed on ice and homogenized with ice￾cold lysis buffer B (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1% TritonX-100
and the protease inhibitor cocktail) with 10 mM of hydroxylamine and sodium
benzoate (each), which suppress the activities of PLP-dependent enzymes and
DAO that are involved in enzymatic H2S production. The lysates were centrifuged
at 12,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered. For measurement of the
H2S released from the bound sulfane sulphur, 0.1 ml of sample (2.5 mg protein per
ml) and 0.1 ml of 15 mM DTT in 0.2 M Tris/HCl (pH 9.0) were placed in a 15-ml
centrifugation tube, sealed with Parafilm and then incubated at 37 1C for 50 min.
After adding 0.4 ml of 1 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0), the mixtures were
incubated at 37 1C for 10 min with shaking at 125 rpm on a rotary shaker NR-3
(Taitec) to facilitate the release of H2S gas from the aqueous phase. H2S con￾centration was determined according to the method described for the determina￾tion of the H2S produced by the enzymes. A reaction mixture without the samples
was used as a control to account for the release of H2S from DTT.
Renal ischaemia-reperfusion. Male ICR mice were anesthetized with an intra￾peritoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg kg  1 body weight). Body
temperature was maintained with a heating blanket. Male ICR mice with a body
weight of 30–40 g were divided into three groups: D-cysteine, L-cysteine and a
control. The D- and L-cysteine (8 mmol kg  1 body weight) were orally adminis￾tered 30 min before ischaemia. Unilateral renal blood flow was interrupted for
30 min by clamping a nontraumatic vascular clamp over renal pedicles. The control
mice were subjected to the same surgical procedures without the oral
administration.
Evaluation of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Twenty-four h after reperfusion, the
kidney was sliced coronally into 2-mm-thick sections by a tissue slicer. To visualize
the area of the ischaemia-reperfusion injury, the slices were incubated with 2%
TTC in saline at room temperature for 30 min. For histological analysis with a
light-microscopy, mice were perfused with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde transcar￾dially. The kidney was removed, post-fixed in paraformaldehyde at 4 1C overnight
and immersed in 5, 15 and 30% (w/v) sucrose in order at 4 1C. The kidney was then
submerged into an O.C.T. compound and frozen. The kidney sections with 4 mm
thickness were cut by a cryostat at  20 1C. The sections were stained with Peri￾odic-Acid-Schiff to highlight glomerular capillary loops and tubular epithelium.
Stained sections were observed with an Axiophoto microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena,
Germany) equipped with a cooled CCD digital camera (Penguin 600CL; Pixera,
Los Gatos, CA).
Statistics. All statistical analyses of the data were performed using Excel 2007 with
the add-in software Statcel2 (OMS, Saitama, Japan). Differences between three or
more groups were analysed with one-way analysis of variance. Post hoc multiple
comparisons were made using the Bonferroni test.
