Abstract
Background: Serum liver enzymes are frequently tested in clinics to aid disease diagnosis. Large observational studies
indicated that these enzymes might predict cancer risk and mortality. However, no prospective study has reported on their
relationships with the risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methodology/Principal Findings: We evaluated the predictive values of four routinely tested liver enzymes (alanine
aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and gamma-glutamyltransferase
[GGT]) in HCC risk in a prospectively enrolled clinical cohort of 588 Korean American HBV patients. For all four enzymes, the
baseline level as well as the average and maximum levels during the first 1 or 2 years of follow-up were analyzed using
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Patients were categorized into a normal or an elevated group based on the
clinical cut-off of each enzyme. During a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 52 patients (incidence rate, 8.8%) developed HCC.
The incidence rates were higher in the elevated groups for all four enzymes. The most significant finding was for GGT, with
the highest incidence rate of 16.4% in the elevated group compared to 4.6% in the normal group (P,0.001). Compared to
patients with normal baseline GGT, those with elevated GGT exhibited a significantly increased HCC risk with a hazards ratio
(HR) of 2.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41–4.77, P = 0.002). Further analyses revealed a cumulative effect between
baseline GGT and ALP (HR = 3.41, 95% CI 1.54–7.56, P = 0.003).
Conclusions Significance: Serum GGT might predict HCC risk in HBV patients individually or jointly with other enzymes.

Introduction
Worldwide, liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer￾related death in men and the sixth in women [1]. Hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) accounts for .80% of liver cancer cases.
Approximately 78% of HCC was attributable to hepatitis B virus
(HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Also, presence of
cirrhosis from any cause markedly increases HCC risk [2]. The
overall age-adjusted HCC incidence rate in the United States
tripled between 1975 and 2005, partially accounted for by the
increase of HCV infection and the influx of immigrants from HBV
endemic regions. According to the World Health Organization,
HCC has the second highest increase in overall death rate of all
malignancies and its burden is expected to continue to increase in
the next a few decades [3]. The five-year survival rate for HCC is
,5% in all patients whereas .30% in patients diagnosed in early
stages and receive surgery or liver transplantation [4]. These facts
highlight the importance of clinical surveillance, risk prediction,
targeted prevention, and early diagnosis in HCC management.
Serum liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and
c-glutamyltransferase (GGT), are tested routinely and automati￾cally in current clinical settings. These enzymes are commonly
elevated in patients with liver diseases and thus may reflect the
status of liver injury [5]. Physicians generally use significant
elevations of liver enzyme levels as complementary markers to aid
the diagnosis of various diseases. For example, elevations of ALT
and AST may indicate the presence of hepatocellular predominant
disorders while elevations of ALP and GGT may implicate
cholestatic predominant diseases [6]. Recent epidemiological
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e47687

studies have shown the associations between abnormally high liver
enzyme levels and risks and mortalities of many diseases [7–10].
However, as yet, no population-based study has been reported on
the associations of these enzymes and the risk of HCC in HBV
patients, especially for baseline enzyme levels measured at the
initial clinic visit of patients. In the current study, we sought to use
a prospective approach to evaluate the effects of these four
commonly tested serum liver enzymes on the long-term risk of
developing HCC in a clinic-based Korean American HBV patient
cohort. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first
prospective studies that comprehensively evaluated these enzymes
in HCC risk.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
The subjects in this study were identified from a clinic-based
patient cohort. The patients in this cohort were consecutively
enrolled from those who visited the Liver Disease Prevention
Center at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital for the treatment
of chronic HBV or HCV infection, and liver diseases such as
cirrhosis, fibrosis, and/or HCC. There were no restrictions on age,
gender, ethnicity, disease stage and etiology in enrollment. The
enrollment started in 1988 and is ongoing. As of October 2010,
the cohort included .2,600 patients. Because .90% of the
patients in this cohort were of Korean ancestry, we restricted the
study to Korean American patients to eliminate the confounding
effect from patient ethnicity. For each patient, hepatitis viral
infection status was clinically determined before or at enrollment.
After the first visit, patients are followed at the center by 3–6
monthly intervals. During each visit, major variables such as liver
function, complete blood count panel, kidney function, HBV DNA
levels and AFP are measured. Abdominal imaging studies are
carried out to detect early HCC. For this study, we included those
patients who met all the following criteria: (1) patients had only
HBV infection but no concomitant infection with HCV, HIV, or
other viruses, in order to eliminate the confounding effects from
disease etiology; (2) patients had all four serum liver enzymes
(ALT, AST, ALP and GGT) measured simultaneously at study
entry, in order to make the baseline analyses comparable; and (3)
patients had a minimum follow-up time of 2 years from the study
entry point and were not diagnosed with HCC within these 2 years
of follow-up. This 2-year exclusion window will help minimize the
confounding effects of those patients who actually developed HCC
but not diagnosed at their initial clinical visits. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the Thomas
Jefferson University. Because this study was based on data
obtained from the review of archived medical charts, patient
consent was waived by the IRB of the Office of Human Research
in Thomas Jefferson University under an approved protocol
including the approval for the request for waiver of authorization
to collect protected health information.
Data Collection
Demographic and clinical data were obtained from medical
records to create a patient-level longitudinal database. Demo￾graphic variables collected for this study included age, gender,
ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and family history
of cancer. Clinical variables were collected at study entry and
follow-up visits with records of ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT values,
as well as other routine clinical variables such as serum AFP, total
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, count of white
blood cells and platelets, prothrombin time, albumin, and ferritin,
etc. Liver cirrhosis and HCC were determined through liver
biopsy supplemented by imaging examinations, mainly magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) [11]. The endpoint of this study is HCC
development. Time to HCC development was defined as the date
from the study entry to the date of HCC diagnosis during follow￾up, or the date of last follow-up if the patients were alive without
HCC diagnosis at the time of this analysis. Patients free of HCC at
death or at the end of last follow-up were censored for analysis.
Determination of Cut-off Values of the Four Serum Liver
Enzymes
The same clinically established protocol of liver function tests
was used to measure the liver enzymes. Abnormal baseline enzyme
levels were defined as the following: for ALT, the upper limit of
normal (ULN) range is #40 U/L for males and #31 U/L for
females; for AST, the ULN range is #37 U/L for males and #31
for females; for ALP, the ULN range is #117 U/L for males and
females adults and 117–390 U/L for children (3–15 years old); for
GGT, the ULN range is #51 U/L for males and #33 U/L for
females [12,13]. Since serum liver enzyme levels may fluctuate
with the pathological states of patients, the use of a single time
point of the enzyme level may result in unstable estimate. To
address this caveat, we also analyzed the average and maximum
enzyme levels during the first 1 year or 2 years of follow-up after
study entry. The average or maximum liver enzyme levels were
defined as the average or highest enzyme levels documented
during the specified follow-up period of an individual.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS software
version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Continuous variables were
expressed as mean with standard deviation (SD) and compared
using the student’s t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) test,
where appropriate. Categorical variables were compared using the
chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, where appropriate. Count
data (number of visit) was compared by using the Poisson
regression analysis. The association between each liver enzyme
and HCC risk was represented by hazards ratio (HR) and 95%
confidence interval (CI) that were estimated using the Cox
proportional hazards regression model, using univariate as well
as multivariate analyses adjusting for age, gender, smoking status,
alcohol consumption, cirrhosis and family history of cancer, where
appropriate. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the
cumulative risks of developing HCC in patients with different
levels of serum liver enzymes, and log rank test was used to
determine the statistical significance. We constructed receiving
operating characteristics (ROC) curves and calculate the area
under the curve (AUC), as well as positive predictive value (PPV)
and negative predictive value (NPV) to evaluate the specificity and
sensitivity of predicating HCC by using the combination of liver
enzymes and epidemiological variables. A joint modeling ap￾proach implemented in the R package JM was used to conduct
longitudinal analysis of GGT and HCC risk. Cumulative
incidence of HCC by follow-up years was derived using Nelson￾Aalen method [14]. The cumulative effects of GGT with other
enzymes on HCC risk were analyzed by comparing patient with
an elevated level of both enzymes to those with a normal level of
both enzymes. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P,0.05 was
considered the threshold of statistical significance.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Population
From the patients enrolled from 1988 through 2010, we
identified 588 subjects that met the criteria described in Materials
Commons Liver Enzymes and HCC Risk
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e47687

and Method. The general characteristics of these patients were
summarized in Table S1. Among the 588 patients, 52 (8.8%)
patients developed HCC within a median follow-up time of 7.5
years. The majority of patients are males (68.0%), younger than 50
years of old (76.9%), never smokers (69.0%), never drinkers
(63.3%), non-cirrhotic (65.0%), and without a family history of
cancer (66.7%). As expected, age and cirrhosis were both
associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC (P,0.001).
Males and ever smokers had a borderline significant increase in
HCC risk (P value, 0.091 and 0.066, respectively). The association
between HCC risk and alcohol consumption or family history of
cancer was not significant (Table S1). The distributions of patient
characteristics in relation to the four liver enzyme levels were listed
in Table 1. A significantly higher percentage of cirrhotic patients
had an elevated level for all the four tested enzymes (P,0.001 for
all four enzymes). In addition, a significantly elevated enzyme level
was observed in males and ever smokers for ALT, in males and
ever drinkers for ALP, and in older patients, ever smokers and ever
drinkers for GGT. Higher HCC incidences were observed in
patients with elevated levels for all four enzymes, especially for
GGT which was associated with the highest HCC incidence of
16.4% in the elevated group compared to 4.6% in the normal
group (P,0.001). There were no significant differences between
the normal and elevated groups for all four enzymes with respect
to age at HCC diagnosis and total follow-up years. For all four
enzymes, patients in the elevated group had a significantly higher
number of enzyme measurements compared to those in the
normal group (P,0.001 for all four enzymes), which is consistent
with clinical practices that the patients with higher enzyme levels
might have more severe diseases and thus had a higher number of
clinical visits.
The Association of Liver Enzymes with HCC Risk in HBV
Patients
We analyzed the associations between each of the four liver
enzymes and HCC risk using univariate and multivariate Cox
proportional hazards regression analyses (Table 2). Because
cirrhosis is one of the strongest risk factors of HCC and might also
be related to liver enzyme levels, we conducted the multivariate
analyses with (the middle column of multivariate analysis of
Table 2) and without (the last column of Table 2) the adjustment
for cirrhosis. In order to minimize the variations resulting from the
use of a single time point, we also analyzed, in addition to the
baseline level at study entry, the average and maximum levels
within the first one year (Table 2) and two years (Table S3) of
follow-up. As shown in Table 2, ALT was not associated with an
altered HCC risk in both univariate and multivariate analyses.
Since there was no universally agreed definition of abnormal ALT
cut-off in the clinical setting, we conducted the analyses by
different ALT cut-off values used in clinics, and did not find any
significant result in the univariate and multivariate analyses for
any of these cut-off values (Table S2). Baseline AST was
associated with an increased HCC risk in the univariate analysis
(HR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.09–3.41, P = 0.023) and the multivariate
analysis without adjusting cirrhosis (HR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.14–
3.67, P = 0.017). However, the significant association disappeared
when the analysis was adjusted for cirrhosis (HR = 1.35, 95% CI
0.74–2.49, P = 0.331). Similar results were noticed for ALP, for
which all five tested enzyme levels were associated with an
increased HCC risk in the univariate analysis and multivariate
analysis without adjusting cirrhosis, which disappeared when
cirrhosis was adjusted in the multivariate analysis. These results
indicated that the increased HCC risk conferred by elevated AST
and ALP levels were likely mediated by cirrhosis. In comparison,
GGT exhibited the most significant association HCC risk. For
example, abnormal baseline GGT level conferred a significant
HCC risk with an HR of 3.91 (95% CI 2.18–7.00, P,0.001) for
univariate analysis and 2.86 (95% CI 1.55–5.26, P = 0.001) for the
multivariate analysis without adjusting cirrhosis. When cirrhosis
was included in the multivariate analysis, the association, although
attenuated, remained statistically significant with an HR of 2.60
(95% CI 1.41–4.77, P = 0.002) (Table 2). Similar results were
noticed for average and maximum GGT levels in one and two
years of follow-up (Table S2 and Table S3). These data strongly
suggested that serum GGT was an independent prospective
predictor of HCC risk in HBV patients. We further categorized
GGT levels to normal (# ULN), elevated (1–2x ULN) and highly
elevated (.2x ULN) groups to evaluate if the effects observed for
GGT were dose-dependent. In the univariate analysis, a highly
significant dose response was observed (P trend,0.001 for all
analyses, Table S4). The effect, although attenuated, remained
significant after adjusting for the major variables including
cirrhosis (P trend ranged from 0.002 to 0.043 for the five different
GGT measurements, Table S4). This analysis further confirmed
serum GGT as a robust independent HCC predictor. We further
conducted stratified analysis of GGT by demographic variables
and cirrhosis. In the multivariate analysis adjusting all variables,
the GGT-HCC association remained significant in males
(P = 0.006), older patients (P = 0.003), never (P = 0.021) and ever
smokers (P = 0.011), never (P = 0.036) and ever drinkers
(P = 0.006), cirrhotic patients (P = 0.003), and patients without a
family history of cancer (P = 0.014) (Table S5). The AUC was
0.84 for ROC constructed incorporating age, gender, smoking
status, alcohol consumption, cirrhosis, family history of cancer,
and GGT. The NPV was 99.15 and the PPV was 20.67. The
results of our ROC analysis had a low false-negative rate whereas
a high rate of false-positive. Therefore, additional approaches are
necessary to further identify patients who are most likely to
develop HCC. We further conducted a longitudinal analysis of
GGT and the risk of developing HCC in HBV patients. Similarly,
we found a significant association between log (GGT) and HCC
risk with HR of 2.03 (95% CI 1.68–2.45, P = 0.0002) (Data not
shown).
Cumulative Risk of HCC by Baseline Serum Liver Enzymes
The cumulative incidence of HCC in our study population by
baseline serum liver enzymes during the complete follow-up period
(1988–2010) was shown in Figure 1. An increasing trend of
cumulative HCC incidences over the follow-up period was
observed for all four enzymes. The log rank P value was 0.341,
0.021, 0.0001 and ,0.001 for ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT,
respectively (Figure 1). In line with the results of Table 2, GGT
exhibited the best discriminative capacity. The detailed cumulative
incidence of HCC in the follow-up of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and .18
years were shown in Table S6. Consistently, GGT exhibited the
strongest discriminative capacity. For instance, for patients with
.18 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence in those with
normal vs. elevated enzyme levels was 44.0 vs. 77.3 for ALT,
69.9 vs. 74.5 for AST, 73.2 vs. 80.2 for ALP, whereas 32.7 vs.
80.6 for GGT. Patients with the normal vs. elevated levels of GGT
had the largest difference in HCC incidence for all the follow-up
periods examined (Table S6).
Combined Effects of GGT with Other Liver Enzymes on
HCC Risk
GGT was commonly tested in the hepatic panel together with
other liver enzymes in clinical settings [6]. The joint analysis of
GGT with other enzymes may yield additional information

regarding disease risk and diagnosis. For example, elevated GGT
combined with elevated ALP usually points to hepatobiliary injury,
which distinguishes from ALP elevation alone resulting from bone
diseases [15]. We further combined GGT with ALT, AST or ALP
to determine if the combined evaluation could improve the
predictive power compared to GGT alone. As shown in Table 3,
the combined analysis of GGT with ALP markedly increased
HCC risk in patients with an elevated level of both enzymes
compared to those with a normal value for both enzymes. For
example, in baseline analysis, the unadjusted HR increased from
3.91 (2.18–7.00, P,0.001) in GGT alone (Table 2) to 8.06 (3.87–
16.8, P,0.001) in the combined use of GGT with ALP (Table 3).
The multivariate adjusted HR increased from 2.60 (1.41–4.77,
P = 0.002, adjusting all variables) and 2.86 (1.55–5.26, P = 0.001,

without adjusting cirrhosis) in GGT alone to 3.41 (1.54–7.56,
P = 0.003) and 4.47 (2.05–9.76, P,0.001) in the combination of
GGT with ALP, respectively. Similar levels of increased effects
were observed for the use of average or maximum GGT level
(Table 3). In comparison, the combinations of GGT with ALT or
AST did not exhibit a significant association with HCC risk in the
multivariate analysis adjusting for cirrhosis (Table 3).
Discussion
We extensively evaluated the associations between four com￾mon liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP and GGT) that are routinely
tested in the clinical setting, and the risk of developing HCC in a
prospectively enrolled cohort of HBV patients. We found that the
clinically significant elevation of serum GGT level, either at
baseline or determined using the average or maximum level of one
or two years of follow-up, independently predicted the risk of
developing HCC in HBV patients. Moreover, we demonstrated
that this effect was dose-dependent and markedly increased when
combined with the use of elevated level of ALP but not ALT or
AST.
There are two major types of serum liver enzyme level changes
commonly encountered in clinical practice: hepatocellular pre￾dominance with elevated ALT and AST, and cholestatic
predominance with elevated ALP and GGT [6]. Serum ALT
and AST are released from damaged hepatocytes into blood and
their activities have been widely recognized as effective tools to
detect liver diseases [16–20]. Actually, ALT is the most extensively
investigated serum enzyme and elevated ALT has been associated
with the mortality of various liver diseases [18,21]. In our study,
we did not observe a significant association between ALT and
HCC risk in either univariate or multivariate analysis, suggesting
the inability of ALT as a prospective predictor of HCC risk in
HBV patients. This was in line with the findings from several
recent studies reporting that biomarkers such as high HBV DNA
load or HBeAg seroconversion predict the increased risk or
mortality of various liver diseases only in patients with normal
serum ALT levels [10,22–24], which further indicated the
complexity of ALT as an HCC risk factor. In our study, AST
exhibited a significant association with HCC risk in the univariate
analysis, which disappeared after multivariate analysis adjusting all
the major variables including cirrhosis. Similar observations were
also noticed for ALP (Table 2). These data indicated that the
associations observed for AST and ALP could be potentially
mediated by the presence of liver cirrhosis. Previous observations
have shown a correlation between AST/ALT ratio and presence
of liver cirrhosis whereas the association between AST or ALP
alone with cirrhosis were not extensively studied [25]. Additional
independent studies are needed to further confirm the roles of
these enzymes in predicting HCC risk in the context of cirrhosis.
In our study, GGT was the only enzyme that predicts the risk of
HCC independent of other major demographic variables and liver
cirrhosis. This result was consistent with several previous studies
showing that GGT was a better predictor than ALT for some

liver-specific diseases in both HBV patients and the general
population [13,26]. In addition to an indicator for hepatobiliary
disorders, elevation of serum GGT has been reported in a variety
of clinical conditions, including pancreatic disease, myocardial
infarction, renal failure, diabetes, and alcoholism [5,27,28]. In
addition, significant associations of elevated GGT with the risk of
several cancers have been reported [7,26,29]_ENREF_10. How￾ever, very few studies have examined the prospective predictive
role of GGT in the risk of HBV-related HCC. As yet, there is only
one study reporting such an association but the population only
included men and GGT was not the major finding of that study
[26]. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first
one to report a strong correlation between elevated serum GGT
and the risk of HBV-related HCC. Based on our large and
prospective clinical cohort population, the significant GGT-HCC
association was independent of other major demographic and
clinical variables including age, gender, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, cirrhosis, and family history of cancer. In this study,
we did not observe a prominent association in females, younger
patients, and patients with a family history of cancer, which were
possibly accounted for by the small number of patients who
developed HCC in these strata (Table S5). Moreover, only a
small number (8 out of 52) of HBV patients who developed HCC
without cirrhosis and the multivariate analysis could not estimate a
reliable association between GGT and HCC risk in those non￾cirrhotic patients (TableS 5). However, the GGT-HCC associ￾ation remained significant in cirrhotic patients after adjusting for
all other variables. This stratified analysis by cirrhosis echoed the
finding of the main effects analyses, that is, unlike ALT, AST, and
ALP, GGT was the only enzyme that exhibited a significant
association with HCC risk independent of other major variables.
These results suggested that the effects conferred by elevated
serum GGT on HCC risk could not be overshadowed by cirrhosis,
the strongest risk factor in developing HCC under any causes.
Serum GGT level has been investigated and developed as a liver
function test for several decades [30,31]; however, the molecular
mechanisms of GGT in HCC development still remains unclear.
Experimental studies have indicated that serum GGT was not
simply derive from the enzyme release from damaged liver cells.
Instead, it was possible that GGT expressed on the cell surface is
released into circulation, which is facilitated by bile acids acting on
the cell membrane [28]. This mechanism is different from ALT
and AST that are released directly from injured liver cells [6].
Since chronic HBV infection is commonly accompanied by severe
injuries of hepatocytes, this mechanism could possibly explain the
fact that GGT was a better predicator than ALT or AST in our
population of HBV patients. Moreover, it has been suggested that
the role of GGT in tumorigenesis might be mediated by the
functions of the oxidative stress pathways in cellular response [32].
GGT is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the degrada￾tion of extracellular glutathione (GSH) and allows the component
amino acids to be available for intracellular GSH re-synthesis [28].
GSH is essential in the protection of cells from damages induced
by oxidants generated during normal metabolism. There is
extensive evidence that GGT and GSH can cooperatively
generate free radicals and thus lead to lipid peroxidation. Since
lipid peroxidation and other metabolisms were significantly
implicated in the tumorigenesis of many malignancies including
HCC, this might also partially explain the GGT-HCC association
observed in our study [33,34]_ENREF_37. Nonetheless, the in￾depth molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the findings
of this study warrant further physiological characterizations.
In addition to viral infections and cirrhosis, environmental
factors such as smoking and alcohol intake are well known risk
factors of HCC development. In our study, we noticed that ever
smoking conferred a borderline increase in HCC risk which was
consistent with previous studies [35]. However, we did not observe
a significant association between ever drinking and HCC risk in
our study (Table S1). Many studies have suggested that there was
a threshold of alcohol intake in relation to HCC risk. Moreover,
some studies reported that light drinking might have a protective
effect for HCC development [36,37]. Unfortunately, we do not
have the data on the intensities of smoking and drinking in this
study population, which limited our further analyses of their
interactions with GGT on HCC development.
We noticed that the average age (about 50 years old) at
diagnosis of HCC patients is relatively young compared to patients
in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
database. The majority of HCC patients in the SEER database
had HCV-related HCC. It is known that the age of HCC
diagnosis is younger in HBV-HCC compared to HCV- HCC
patients by one decade in average, because of the different mode/
time of viral transmission. In the endemic region, HBV infection
takes place during neonatal period and/or infancy in the majority
of cases while HCV infection occurs later, e.g., from blood
transfusion. This could partly explain the relatively younger age
for HBV-HCC in our study. In addition, in our study, most HCC
patients (44/52) were males who are usually younger than female
HCC patients.
Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is one of
the largest clinic-based cohorts that have been completely enrolled
in a single institute. The unique and highly homogeneous Korean
American HBV patient populations eliminated the confounding
effects from ethnicity. The highly homogenous of HCC etiology
with uniformly HBV genotype C infection is another important
strength. The majority of the patients in this study were infected
with HBV at birth or childhood and immigrated to the United
State at young age, especially those who developed HCC, making

our population an ideal resource to study the long-term outcome
of HBV infection at the population level. More importantly, our
study used a prospective design with the baseline data collected
many years ahead of HCC diagnosis, which circumvented the
reverse-causation issue inherent in most retrospective case-control
epidemiological studies. All of the included patients had complete
data of the four liver enzymes measured simultaneously at study
entry, making the analyses completely comparable. The strict
restriction of patients to those with a $2 years of follow-up and
exclusion of those who developed HCC within this 2-year window
further significantly reduced the chance of false positive findings.
Finally, we extensively analyzed the data by different liver enzymes
levels during different periods of follow-up, instead of only using
the baseline level. Results of the analyses of the average and
maximum enzymes levels during one or two years of follow-up
were highly consistent with the baseline findings. Despite these
strong strengths, our study also had limitations. First, the
generalizability of our findings to other ethnic groups as well as
to patients with other HCC etiologies such as HCV infection
remained to be assessed. Second, the total number of 2,600 was
the entire number of patients seen at the center over a span of 23
years. While the majority of them (.90%) were HBV patients,
there were others including patients with other conditions such as
HCV, Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver
disease, hemochromatosis, drug-induced hepatitis, primary biliary
cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, and etc. During the 23 years’
period, some patients returned to their physicians and some did
not return or moved away. Moreover, some had irregular visits in
years and also many died. The 588 patients were those who were
on regular follow-up with available lab test data on the four liver
enzymes during each visit. This high attrition rate of our
population is another limitation of generalization to common
population. Third, the lack of accurate alcohol consumption data
is a major limitation, as exemplified by the fact that ever drinkers
did not exhibit elevated AST levels. Due to the incomplete data on
smoking and drinking intensity, we are not able to analyze the
cumulative and interaction effects between GGT and smoking or
drinking intensity. Fourth, we do not have the complete data of
some other clinical variables determined at the same time when all
the four enzymes were measured. Another limitation of our study
is the lack of data on the lag time between diagnosis of HBV
infection and enzyme measurement. Future prospective studies are
warranted to analyze the influence of this factor on HCC
incidence in HBV patients.
In summary, based on a large prospectively enrolled clinic￾based HBV patient cohort, we found that the elevation of serum
GGT level could potentially be used as a prospective biomarker of
the long-term risk of developing HCC in HBV patients. If
validated, GGT may be combined with other major HCC risk
factors to build a HCC risk assessment model that can be applied
in the clinical settings.
