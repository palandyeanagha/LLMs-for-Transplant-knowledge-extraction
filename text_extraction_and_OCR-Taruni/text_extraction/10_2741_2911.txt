1. ABSTRACT 
Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) is a 
transmembrane glycoprotein that is associated with various 
cancers. Most normal, non-pathological epithelial tissue is 
EpCAM positive with the exception of epidermal 
keratinocytes, gastric parietal cells, myoepithelial cells, 
thymic cortical epithelial, and hepatocytes. However, 
during early liver development EpCAM expression is also 
observed. In our studies, we have demonstrated that 
EpCAM is expressed in non-pathological human livers on 
hepatic progenitors in livers of all donor ages, from 16 
weeks gestation fetal livers to adult. Hepatic progenitors of 
the liver consist of the stem cells and their descendants, the 
hepatoblasts, that give rise to the hepatocytic and biliary 
lineages. Both hepatic stem cells and most hepatoblasts 
express EpCAM, but only hepatoblasts are alpha￾fetoprotein positive. The percentage of EpCAM positive 
progenitors in human livers varies with donor age and is 
about 2.5% in the adult and 12.1% in fetuses. In vivo, 
hepatic stem cells have been found associated with the 
canals of Hering. Xeno-transplantation experiments with 
EpCAM positive human liver cells have revealed their 
potential for proliferation and differentiation to mature liver 
parenchymal cells. 
2. INTRODUCTION 
Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule or EpCAM 
(also called GA733-2, KSA, CD326, ESA, or 17-1A 
antigen) is a transmembrane glycoprotein identified 
initially as associated with various epithelial cancers (e.g. 
carcinomas of colon and rectum, stomach, pancreas, liver, 
lung, mammary gland, ovary, thyroid, kidney, urinary 
bladder, and prostate). EpCAM positive (+) cells are found 
also in normal, non-pathological epithelial tissue with the 
exception of epidermal keratinocytes, gastric parietal cells, 
mature liver cells (hepatocytes), thymic cortical epithelial, 
and myoepithelial cells (1). In general, cell-cell adhesion 
through EpCAM is calcium independent (2, 3). 
3. EPCAM EXPRESSION IN NORMAL, NON￾PATHOLOGICAL TISSUES 
In liver, EpCAM expression is observed during 
early organ development (4-6). In our studies, we have 
demonstrated that EpCAM is expressed in non-pathological 
human livers on hepatic progenitors but not hepatocytes in 
livers of all donor ages; our studies comprised assays on 
livers from 16 weeks gestation fetal livers to geriatric 
adults (7-9). Hepatic progenitors of the liver consist of the

stem cells, multipotent progenitors, and their descendants, 
the hepatoblasts, bipotent progenitors that give rise to the 
hepatocytic and biliary lineages and have been shown to 
co-express hepatocytic and billiary proteins (7,10). We 
were able to show that both hepatic stem cells and most of 
the hepatoblasts express EpCAM (see Figure 1 for an 
immunohistochemical staining of EpCAM in fetal human 
liver) and CD44 (hyaluronan receptor) (11), but only 
hepatoblasts are alpha-fetoprotein positive. The percentage 
of EpCAM+ progenitors in human livers varies with donor 
age and is about 0.5-1.5% in the adult (up to 3% in livers 
subjected to ischemia) and 12.1% in fetuses (9). The higher 
percentage in fetal livers correlates with the fact that the 
majority (>80%) of parenchymal cells in fetal livers are 
hepatoblasts, whereas in adult livers hepatoblasts have 
declined in number to constitute less than 0.01% of the 
parenchymal cells. In vivo, hepatic stem cells have been 
found in pediatric and adult human livers associated with 
ductal plates in fetal and neonatal livers and in the canals of 
Hering in pediatric and adult livers (9, 12, 13) (Zhang et al., 
submitted). The ductal plate, a band of tissue encircling the 
portal triads like a sleeve (see Figure 2), has proven to be 
liver’s stem cell compartment or niche and transitions in 
postnatal life to become the canals of Hering (Zhang et al., 
submitted). The canals of Hering are 1 – 2 µm wide 
anatomical structures clustered around the portal triads and 
consisting of small ductules connecting the biliary epithelia 
system with the hepatocytes. Bile, produced by 
hepatocytes, is released from bile canaliculi, found at the 
apical borders of the hepatocytes, and from there is 
transported to the bile duct epithelium; the bile ducts 
transport the bile and releases it into the gut. Xeno￾transplantation experiments with EpCAM+ human liver 
cells and with long-term cultures of human hepatic stem 
cells, also EpCAM+, have revealed their potential for 
proliferation and for differentiation to mature liver 
parenchymal cells (9). 
Studies by Dan et al. (14) on progenitors culture 
selected from human fetal livers of gestational days 74-108 
similarly demonstrated EpCAM expression. These 
progenitors were judged by the authors as mesendoderm￾derived, mesenchymal-epithelial transitional cells and 
could give rise to both liver and to tissues of mesodermal 
fates such as cartilage. However, the culture conditions 
potentially had co-selected a mesenchymal progenitor 
along with the hepatic progenitor. Their findings are 
distinct from our own in which hepatic progenitors do not 
express mesenchymal, endothelial, or hematopoietic 
markers (9). 
Interestingly, EpCAM expression has been 
correlated to many populations of progenitors in the 
development of other organs, too. Adhesion molecules in 
general have been shown to play the major role in 
morphogenesis and cell movement. This has been 
demonstrated for EpCAM in the assembly of germ line 
cells in development, where EpCAM is expressed during 
formation and early gonad assembly (15). Neonatal male 
and female germ cells remain EpCAM+, whereas in adult 
testis EpCAM is absent with the exception of 
spermatogonia. 
Research by Cirulli et al. (16, 17) indicates a 
regulatory role of morphogenesis of EpCAM during 
pancreas development. The inhibition of cell-cell 
interactions mediated by EpCAM in human fetal pancreas 
progenitor cell suspensions was achieved using an EpCAM 
antibody, and cells were cultured with constant inhibition 
of cell-cell interactions. This blocking resulted in increased 
insulin and glucagon gene transcription, i.e. the blocking 
induced differentiation towards pancreatic island cells by 
imitating either a functional down-regulation or 
inactivation of the EpCAM receptor from the cell surface. 
In addition, transplantation experiments of fetal pancreatic 
EpCAM+ cells demonstrated that down regulation of 
EpCAM expression is associated with endocrine 
differentiation. Analyses of human EpCAM expression in
vivo revealed highest levels of islet-like cells outgrowing 
from the ductal epithelium in fetal pancreas. However, islet 
cells of the adult pancreas showed low EpCAM expression 
and the adult ductal epithelium high levels. 
In human mammary tissue, three types of normal 
progenitor populations of the breast epithelium could be 
identified (18, 19): 1) a luminal-restricted, 2) a 
myoepithelial-restricted, and 3) a bipotent progenitor that 
gives rise to both restricted progenitors. Only bipotent and 
luminal restricted progenitors expressed EpCAM. Recent 
advances in breast cancer research (for review, see (20)) 
demonstrated the existence of an individual cancer stem 
cell population within the heterogeneous cell populations of 
solid breast tumors (21). This distinct, minor cell 
population was exclusively able to form new tumors, i.e. to 
be tumorigenic, throughout serial passaging. It showed self￾renewal as well as generation of the non-tumorigenic 
phenotypes of the initial tumor. The phenotype of this 
proposed cancer stem cell or “tumor initiating cell” was 
CD44+

(EpCAM), bearing strikingly 
similarities in surface molecule expression to normal 
hepatic progenitors. 
Throughout human lung development, EpCAM 
can be detected in the epithelia of the primary pulmonary

primordium, secondary bronchi and bronchial epithelium 
(22). In the adult lung, EpCAM is expressed in type I and II 
alveolar epithelial cells. 
The murine homologue of EpCAM, gp40, has 
been detected on outgrowths of dendritic cells from 
epidermis, skin-associated lymph nodes, keratinocytes, and 
spleen (23). The gp40 protein is also expressed by thymic 
epithelium (24). Fetal thymocytes express high levels of 
gp40, but its expression declines during development and 
has been suggested to play a role in thymocyte 
development, interactions between epithelium and 
thymocytes or dendritic cells, and the formation of a 
stromal network within the thymus (25). Immature 
erythroids of the bone marrow (erythroblasts) have been 
shown to be EpCAM+ (26), but the expression remains 
restricted to progenitors as it is strongly diminished with 
erythroid maturation (27). 
The apparent connection of EpCAM to highly 
proliferating cell types, i.e. its expression in progenitors of 
diverse tissues and its reduced expression during 
differentiation as well as the upregulation (1) or induction 
(28) during carcinogenesis, raises the question whether 
EpCAM might be involved in cell proliferation. 
Interestingly, a direct role for EpCAM in cell proliferation 
and cell cycle could be demonstrated by its capability for 
upregulation of c-myc and cyclin A/E, with its intracellular 
part sufficient and necessary for the upregulation (29). In 
addition, the epidermal fatty acid binding protein, a target 
of c-myc, has been demonstrated to be a target of EpCAM 
(30). In primary and metastatic breast cancer EpCAM gene 
expression is increased up to 1000fold; silencing of 
EpCAM gene expression in breast cancer cell lines caused 
a decrease in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, 
associated with an increase in the detergent-insoluble 
protein fractions of E-cadherin, alpha-, and beta-catenin 
(31). Similarly, primary squamous carcinoma of the tongue 
show elevated EpCAM gene expression and its expression 
was associated with tumor size, metastasis and invasion; 
RNAi mediated knockdown of EpCAM expressions 
likewise decreased the invasive potential and proliferation 
(32). Two possible intrinsic cellular signaling mechanisms 
relating EpCAM to cell migration and proliferation have 
been suggested (31): induced down-regulation of EpCAM 
increases the fractions of E-cadherin, alpha-, and beta￾catenin anchored to the cytoskeleton; cadherins are known 
to be fundamental for maintenance of cell polarity and 
proliferation. Additionally, beta-catenin is the major 
transducer in the Wnt-pathway which has been 
demonstrated to be an important regulator in cell 
proliferation and tumor development (see also (33) for an 
overview of the role of EpCAM in cancer therapy and the 
possible association of EpCAM with the Wnt pathway). 
In summary, EpCAM has been demonstrated to 
identify many types of normal and malignantly transformed 
epithelial progenitor populations and potentially plays 
regulatory roles in proliferation of these cells. Its 
expression fades and its regulatory effects become muted as 
the progenitor cells differentiate through their respective 
maturational lineages to adult, differentiated fates. The 
potential roles of EpCAM in regulating proliferation of 
normal and transformed progenitor cells and the 
mechanisms of action have yet to be elucidated and are 
likely to be the focus of many future studies.
