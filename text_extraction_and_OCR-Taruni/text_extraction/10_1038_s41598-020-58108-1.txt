This study aims at evaluating the symptom response, response duration, and toxicity of single dose 
palliative liver radiotherapy (RT) for symptomatic HCC patients. We reviewed unresectable HCC patients 
treated with palliative RT in our institution. Eligible patients were unsuitable or refractory to trans￾arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), with an index symptom 
of pain or abdominal discomfort. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients with clinical 
improvement of index symptom at 1 month. Secondary outcomes were response duration, toxicities, 
alpha-feto protein (AFP) response, and radiological response. Fifty-two patients were included in the 
study. The index symptom was pain in 34 patients (65.4%), and abdominal discomfort (34.6%) in 18 
patients. At 1 month, 51.9% of patients had improvement of symptoms. Median time to symptom 
progression was 89 days (range: 12–392 days). Treatment was well tolerated with only 2 patients (3.8%) 
developing grade 3 GI toxicities. AFP response, radiological response rate, and disease control rate at 
3 months were 48.6%, 15.1%, and 54.5% respectively. Half of the patients had improvement of index 
symptoms after receiving palliative liver RT with median response duration of 3 months. The treatment 
was well tolerated with minimal toxicities.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of global cancer death1
. Surgical interventions provide the 
only chance of cure, yet majority of patients present with advanced disease and are treated with trans-arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE), targeted therapy, or best supportive care (BSC).
Conformal high dose radiotherapy (RT) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a promising 
local therapy in treating unresectable HCC. Multiple studies demonstrated the tumor control at 1 year and 2 year 
in majority of patients2–4
. Yet, because of the extensive liver involvement with cancer, borderline liver function, 
and/or presence of extra-hepatic metastases, many patients are not suitable for high dose radiation. The tolerance 
of whole liver to radiation is low5
.
Patients who present in advanced stage often experience symptoms of pain or abdominal discomfort at some 
point of their illnesses6
. Effective palliation of hepatic pain is challenging. To date, there is limited research regarding 
palliative radiotherapy (RT) specifically in the HCC population. In the early studies of whole-liver RT in patients 
mainly with liver metastases at doses ranging from 20–30Gy, benefit of symptom palliation was observed in 49–95% 
of patients with limited toxicities7–14. Until recently, in a prospective phase II trial of 41 patients with HCC and liver 
metastases, the use of 8Gy in single fraction to the whole liver resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in 
average index symptom intensity in 48% of patients one month following RT. Benefits were only observed in patients 
with pain and abdominal discomfort. Treatment was well tolerated with only one patient developed grade 3 toxicity15. 
The randomized controlled trial to compare palliative RT against BSC in terminal HCC patients is underway.
The use of 8Gy single fraction RT is attractive for HCC patients with short life expectancy. Yet, there has been 
limited published experience on the efficacy and safety of such treatment. In our institution, palliative liver RT is 
indicated in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) advanced or terminal stage (BCLC stage C and D) patients 
with tumor causing hepatic pain or abdominal discomfort. This study aims at evaluating the symptom response, 
response duration, and toxicity of palliative liver RT in symptomatic HCC patients.

Materials and Methods
Eligibility. In this study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong 
Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (HKU/HA HKW IRB) (IRB number: NTWC/CREC/18044), 
were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. We reviewed outcomes of 52 patients 
who received palliative RT (8 Gy single fraction) for HCC between July 2012 and December 2017 in our hos￾pital. According to our institutional protocol, eligible patients of treatment had HCC diagnosed pathologically 
or by American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) criteria who were unsuitable or refractory 
to TACE, resection, transplantation, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or ablative dose of SBRT. All of them had 
index symptoms of either pain or abdominal discomfort. Other eligibility criteria includes, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 3, expected survival≥1 month, platelet count>25×109
/L, 
hemoglobin>70 g/L, international normalized ratio (INR)<3, bilirubin<100 umol/L, and AST and ALT<10 x 
upper limit of normal (ULN). Patients with child-pugh (CP) score≥C10, prior RT or selective internal radiation 
therapy (SIRT) to abdomen, targeted therapy or systemic therapy received within 2 weeks prior radiotherapy, or 
TACE received within 4 weeks prior RT would be considered to be ineligible.
Treatment. All patients were pre-medicated with 5HT3 antagonist and oral dexamethasone 4 mg daily on 
the date of RT. Patients who were hepatitis B carriers were pre-emptively started on entecavir 0.5mg daily at least 
one week before RT.
At RT planning, patients were simulated in a supine position using VacLok (MEDTEC, Iowa, USA) with a 
non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan. Free-breathing during simulation CT was allowed. The gross 
tumor volume (GTV) includes all HCC foci causing pain or abdominal discomfort; delineation of GTV was 
aided by co-registration with diagnostic tri-phasic contrast CT. The minimum margin of 0mm was added around 
GTV to form the clinical target volume (CTV). The CTV consisted of (almost) whole liver in patients with diffuse 
tumor involvement. The planning target volume (PTV) was generated from the CTV with a 5mm axial margin 
and 10mm cranial caudal margin to account for setup error and organ motion.
The prescription dose of 8Gy in a single fraction was chosen based on the prospective phase II study from the 
Princess Margaret Cancer Center Group14. Treatment was planned with either a 6MV or 10MV photons using 
the conformal technique. PTV was aimed to receive 95% to 107% of the prescribed dose with adherence to the 
International Commission on Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) 62 report. Maximum dose to the stom￾ach, small bowel, and spinal cord had to be less than 10Gy.
Patient assessment. Clinicians prospectively followed patients according to the institutional protocol. 
Symptoms, toxicities, liver function and alpha-feto protein (AFP) were monitored at baseline, week 2, week 4, 
monthly in the first 6 months after RT, and every 3 months thereafter till death. The use of analgesic and other 
medications were also recorded at each assessment. Physician reported symptoms were classified into 4 cate￾gories: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) which 
were defined as follows (13–14): CR: complete disappearance of index symptom and not requiring any regular 
analgesics; PR: partial improvement of index symptom without an increase in consumption of analgesics; SD: 
stable index symptom without increase in consumption of analgesics; PD: either worsening of index symptom 
or an increase in consumption of regular analgesics. Potential toxicities were graded using the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Liver function deterioration 
was defined by worsening of CP score≥2 at three months of RT completion. Liver toxicity was censored at the 
time of intrahepatic progression. Radiological assessment using computed tomography (CT) was not mandatory 
and at the discretion of physicians. The tumor response was measured using Response Evaluation Criteria In 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1.
Statistics. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with clinical improvement of index symptom 
(CR+PR) at 1 month. Secondary endpoints were symptom response duration, toxicities, overall survival (OS), 
AFP response, and radiological response. Symptom response duration was defined as the period from date of RT 
to the date of index symptom deterioration. OS was calculated from the date of RT to the date of death due to 
whatever causes. AFP response was defined as>20% drop from baseline16.
R version 3.25 (Vienna, Austria) was used for statistical analysis. Symptom response, response duration, radi￾ological and AFP response, and toxicities were summarized with descriptive statistics. Comparison of categorical 
data between groups was performed by Chi-Square test or fisher exact test if appropriate. A Kaplan-Meier curve 
was used to calculate the OS. The log-rank test was used to compare outcomes among survival curves for poten￾tial prognostic factors. Any factor that was significant in univariate analyses was subjected to multivariate analy￾ses using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. A statistical level of p=0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Patients and treatment. From July 2012 to December 2017, a total of 52 patients fell under the afore￾mentioned eligible criteria were treated and prospectively followed in accordance to our institutional protocol. 
Baseline patient and treatment characteristics are presented in Table 1. 38 patients (73%) were hepatitis B carriers. 
Median size of the largest tumor was 13 cm (range, 3–24 cm); 33 patients (63.5%) had tumor involvement>50% 
of total liver volume; majority (98.1%) had BCLC stage C disease. 34 patients (65.4%) received no prior treatment. 
23 patients (45.1%) were treated with Sorafenib after RT, while half of them received no further treatment.
Symptom response and duration. The index symptom was pain in 34 patients (65.4%), and abdominal 
discomfort in 18 patients (34.6%). Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients who had improvement of index symp￾toms at 1 month. Overall, 51.9% (95% confidence interval Cl, 37.6–66.0%) of patients had clinical improvement 
of symptoms at 1 month; 50% (95% Cl, 30.8 – 78.5%) for patients with pain, and 55.6% (95% Cl, 32.4 – 67.6%)

for those with abdominal discomfort. Five patients had missing information (n=3, died before 1 month, n=2, 
no information).
Median time to symptom worsening was 89 days (range: 12–392 days). Patients with clinical improvement 
(CR+PR) at 1 month (median time 114 days, range: 34–392 days) had more durable control of symptoms than 
those without improvement (SD+PD) (median time 55 days, range: 14–194 days) (p=0.24). Figure 2 shows the 
symptom response and response duration of individual patients. 21 patients (40%) did not experience worsening 
of symptoms before death. By means of the logistic regression model, no clinical or dosimetric factors could be 
identified in predicting symptom responders (Table 2).
Toxicity. Treatment is well tolerated with no grade 4 or 5 toxicities. The most commonly seen grade 3 toxicity was 
elevation of AST (n=3, 5.8%). Grade 3 fatigue, nausea and vomiting was observed in 1 patient (1.9%). No patient 
developed classical RILD. 8.8% of patients had deterioration of CP score≥2 at 3 months. Table 3 summarized

Survival, biochemical response, and radiological response. With reference to Fig. 3, the median 
follow-up time was 4.7 months (range: 0.4 – 30.2 months); no patient was lost to follow-up. Overall, the median 
OS was 4.5 months (95% Cl: 3.3 – 5.7 months). Patients who received post-RT treatment had better OS (median: 
6.5 months, 95% Cl, 4.7–8.2 months) than those receiving no further treatment (median: 2.3 months, 95% Cl, 
1.2–3.3 months) (p=0.021). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis in prediction of 90-day survival was 
shown in Table 4. Portal vein thrombosis (hazard ratio HR: 7.16, 95% Cl 1.41–36.32, p=0.018) and baseline ALBI 
score (HR: 32.35, 95% Cl 4.23–36.32, p=0.001) were identified as independent prognostic factors.
Among 35 patients had baseline elevation of AFP level, 17 patients (48.6%) had AFP response; notably, 7 of 
them did not receive further treatment after the RT. For 33 patients who had CT performed at 3 months, radio￾logical response was observed in 5 patients (15.1%); 1 of them did not receive further treatment with CT images 
was presented in supplementary figure 1. Disease control was reported in 18 patients (54.5%).
Discussion
This study supports the findings of previous phase II trial that palliative RT 8 Gy single fraction is an effective 
regime in relieving hepatic pain or abdominal discomfort in advanced HCC patients15. In the current study, 
substantial patients reported improvement of hepatic pain (50%) or abdominal discomfort (55.6%) at one month 
after RT. The median response duration was around 3 months.
Most advanced HCC patients experience symptoms of pain or abdominal discomfort at some point of their 
illnesses. Often, patients become refractory to available medical therapy for a period of time before they died 
and most of them suffered from severe symptom burden. Management of hepatic pain is challenging. Opioid is 
commonly prescribed in controlling cancer pain; however, in patients with liver function impairment, which is 
commonly seen in HCC patients, the parent drug and its metabolites may accumulate and precipitate encepha￾lopathy and cause excessive sedation17. There is an unmet need for a better strategy to palliate pain and discomfort 
in the advanced HCC population.
There was a paucity of studies to evaluate palliative liver RT in the HCC population. Early studies of low-dose 
liver RT were mainly conducted in patients with liver metastases7–14. But it is known that patients with primary 
liver cancer have poorer prognoses, heavier symptom burden, worse systemic therapy response, but better tumor 
radio-sensitivity than those with metastatic liver diseases18. Also, most of these studies were conducted using 
Figure 1. Bar Chart showing proportion of patients with clinical improvement of pain and abdominal 
discomfort at 1 month (CR+PR, SD, and PD).

obsolete RT techniques, long fractionation schedules, or with concurrent radio-sensitizers that are no longer used 
in routine clinical practice. The largest of these studies in liver metastases delivered 21Gy in 7 fractions to the 
whole liver and randomized patients to misonidazole or placebo; there was an 80% response rate of abdominal 
pain, with a median duration of response of 13 weeks13. Another study observed a physician-reported symptom 
response of 54% at 2 weeks following 10Gy in 2 fractions to the whole liver to palliate symptoms from liver metas￾tases with two grade 3 toxicities14. In a recent prospective phase II trial by Soliman et al., patients with either pri￾mary or secondary liver cancers refractory to all therapies were treated with 8Gy single fraction to whole liver15; 
there was clinically significant improvement at one month in 55% (95% Cl: 32–76%) of patients when assessing 
‘average’ pain or discomfort, and in 59% (95% Cl: 32–76%) when evaluating ‘worst’ pain or discomfort in the 
past 24 hours. There was no difference in terms of symptom response between patients with HCC (n=21) and 
liver metastases (n=20). The benefits in terms of quality of life (QOL) improvement were comparatively modest. 
Overall, RT is well tolerated with only 7% of patients developed grade 3 toxicities.
The present study is unique in recruiting exclusively HCC patients among an endemic hepatitis B viral (HBV) 
infected population. HCC differ from other liver cancers with distinct disease course and treatment response; 
these patients are more often to have pre-existing chronic liver diseases and active viral infections, and are there￾fore more vulnerable to radiation-induced hepatic toxicities5
. Of note, 73% patients in the present study are HBV 
carriers. 51.9% of patients had index symptom improvement at one month and a low rate of grade 3 toxicities, 
Figure 2. Symptom response, response duration, and overall survival of individual patient (N=52).

which concurs with previous studies. Among 34 patients alive at 3 months post-RT, only three (8.8%) patients 
developed progression of CP≥2; it indicates that low dose radiation is generally safe even in a population of 
advanced disease and borderline hepatic function. We have commenced entecavir to all HBV carriers one week 
before RT and there were no viral re-activation observed.
Another strength of this study is that patients were prospectively followed regularly for their symptoms until 
their death. The median time to symptom worsening was around 3 months, which is similar to what was shown 
in earlier study with response duration of 13 weeks treated with more protracted fractionation. Also, similar 
response duration of 3 months was observed in patients with bone metastasis treated with RT of 8 Gy single 
fraction19. Using this shortest effective fraction is advantageous for advanced HCC patients with limited survival. 
The median OS of our cohort was only 4.5 months (95% Cl: 3.3–5.7 months); patients who had portal vein throm￾bosis (HR: 7.2, p=0.01) or advanced ALBI grade (HR: 32.4, p=0.001) had even poorer prognoses. Around 40% 
of the patients (n=21) did not experience worsening of symptoms before death after the single fraction treat￾ment. There was a trend suggesting that better symptom responders to RT also enjoy a better response duration 
(CR+PR 3.7 months vs. SD+PD 1.8 months, p=0.24). Yet, we were unable to identify predictors of symptom 
responder.
Most patients (98%) in the present study had BCLC advanced disease in which Sorafenib is the current stand￾ard of care; however, Sorafenib had no benefit in prolonging patient’s time to symptomatic progression and there 
is limited data concerning its efficacy on symptom improvement20,21. Advanced HCC patients in our population 
often presented with pain or abdominal discomfort due to sizable tumors22. In our practice, low dose RT was 
used upfront for symptomatic patients to provide rapid palliation; Sorafenib was then started within 2 weeks after 
completion of RT. Among twenty-three patients treated with such approach, 52.6% had symptom improvement

at 1 month and the median time of symptom worsening was 4 months, which compares favorably to the historical 
data of Sorafenib. There were no abnormal safety signals detected. Of note, the symptom response and toxicity 
measurement of RT in this group of patients might have been confounded by the effect of Sorafenib. Whether 
combining low-dose RT to Sorafenib in advanced symptomatic HCC patients would confer quality of life (QoL) 
benefit warrants further exploration.
Few patients had marker or radiological response after RT alone, and the responses were usually short-lived. 
Indeed, the radiation dose (EQD2 2Gy equivalent dose=12Gy) is too low to expect tumor response. Thus, the 
palliative effect is unlikely due to tumor shrinkage, but its exact mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies in 
bone metastases postulated that radiation might reduce the tumor-secreting cytokines that sensitize patients to 
pain signals23,24. Further translational research to correlate the change of cytokines levels to pain response after 
low-dose liver RT would be of interest.
Nonetheless, our study has several limitations. This is a single institution retrospective study. We have 
included consecutive patients treated with low-dose liver RT in our department during the study period into 
analysis to minimize any selection bias; the symptom response information was prospectively collected resulting 
in a low rate of missing information. However, there was no comparative group treated with medical palliative 
therapy alone to determine whether RT had any added benefit over medical symptoms management. Also, as 
the primary endpoint of symptom improvement was measured by physicians’ reported outcomes, potential bias 
might have been introduced. Furthermore, sequential evaluation on the time and pattern of progression was not 
otherwise feasible as patients’ limited survival has precluded serial imaging. On the other hand, our study offers 
the advantage of consistent treatment facilities and personnel with multidisciplinary discussions and team-based, 
protocol-oriented treatment decisions within a single institution. In addition, treatment response was docu￾mented prospectively adhering to unified criteria as defined in our institutional protocol. Although we could 
not completely eliminate physician bias or individual variability, our results are hypothesis generating and have 
stemmed from preliminary results suggesting promising RT effects among the advanced HCC population with 
unmet clinical needs, in which we hope to shed light on future clinical research. More robust tools such as the 
brief pain inventory (BPI), Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), or MD Anderson Symptom Inventory 
could be utilized in our future prospective study25–27. Collection of patient reported outcomes (PRO) and quality 
of life (QOL) data would also be employed for a more comprehensive symptom assessment28.

To date, there is very limited data to recommend any effective palliative treatment among the terminal HCC 
population. Our preliminary results suggest that palliative low-dose liver RT may potentially be a safe, effective, 
and convenient treatment in advanced HCC patients with pain or abdominal discomfort. Our findings within 
the Asian population are consistent with that among the Western population. Taken together, this provides solid 
ground for potential global prospective randomized phase III trials.
