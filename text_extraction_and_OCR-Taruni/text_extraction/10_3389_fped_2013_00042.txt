Objective: Studies evaluating renal transplant (RT) outcome in children who underwent an
augmentation cystoplasty (AC) are contradictory and the current knowledge is based on
studies with a limited number of patients.The aim of this study is to compare RT outcome
between children who underwent AC and those without augmentation.
Patients and methods: A total of 20p who underwent an AC prior to the RT (12 with
ureter and 8 with intestine) were enrolled in the study and were compared to a control
group of 24p without AC, transplanted in the same time period (1991–2011). Data including;
age at transplant, allograft source, urological complications, urinary tract infections (UTI)
incidence, the presence of VUR, and patient and graft survival were compared between
the groups.
Results: Mean age at RT and mean follow-up were 9.7 vs. 7.9 years and 6.9 vs. 7.9 years
in the AC group and control group, respectively (NS). The graft originated in living donors
for 60% of AC patients and 41.6% of the control RT patients. The rate of UTI were 0.01
UTI/patient/year and 0.004 UTI/patient/year in the augmented group and controls, respec￾tively (p = 0.0001). In the AC group of 14p with UTIs, 10 (71%) had VUR and 5p out of 8
(62.5%) in the control group hadVUR. In the AC group, of the 7p with ≥3 UTIs, 3 (43%) were
non-compliant with CIC and the incidence of UTIs was not related with the type of AC or if
the patient did CIC through a Mitrofanoff conduit or through the urethra. Graft function at
the end of study was 92.9 ± 36.85 ml/min/m2
in the AC group and 88.17 ± 28.2 ml/min/m2
in the control group (NS). Graft survival at 10 years was also similar 88% in the AC group
and 84.8% in controls. In the AC group 3p lost their grafts and 5 in the control group with
respective mean follow-up of 10.6 ± 4.3 and 7.1 + 4.7 years.
Conclusion:There are no significant differences in the RT outcome between children trans￾planted with AC or without. However, recurrent UTIs are more frequent in the former group
and these UTIs are related with non-compliance with CIC or the presence of VUR but, even
so, UTIs will not lead to impaired graft function in most of the patients.

INTRODUCTION
Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) can be responsible for
renal failure in approximately 20% of ESRD children and just as
this may lead to the destruction of their native kidneys, it can also
adversely affect graft survival and function (1).
For a long time patients with LUTD were denied renal trans￾plant (RT) because they were considered very high risk recipients
but in the last few decades, the improvements in the medical
management of LUTD as well as the development of novel sur￾gical techniques (bladder augmentation, Mitrofanoff and Monti
techniques, etc.) have improved these patients’ RT outcome.
Some patients with LUTD will need an augmentation cysto￾plasty (AC) to create a low-pressure and compliant reservoir that
will protect the eventual renal allograft. However, some concerns
have been raised that bladder augmentation in these patients
may increase the risk of complications, predominantly urinary
tract infections (UTI), urological complications, and allograft dys￾function and loss. Several studies have evaluated RT outcome in
relation to AC in children (1–4) with contradictory results and our
current knowledge is based on studies with a limited number of
patients. This study compares RT outcome between children who
underwent AC and those without augmentation to evaluate the
impact of this technique.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Of a total of 369 RT performed in 309 children (aged ≤18 years)
in our department between 1985 and 2012, 20 patients had under￾gone AC before transplant. The causes of ESRD were posterior
urethral valves (PUV) in 12p, neuropathic bladder in 7 and blad￾der agenesis in 1. The control group was made up of 24p with

ESRD secondary to PUV. Both groups underwent transplantation
during the same time period (1992–2011). In the AC group avoid￾ing cystourethrography and urodynamic studies were performed
in all patients when they were entering ESRD, except one (the
patient with bladder agenesis). This study included a cystomet￾rogram or flow-pressure study, electromyography, uroflowmetry,
and measurement of post-voiding residual urine.
In the bladder augmentation group, this procedure was always
performed prior to transplantation; AC was done with ureter in
12 patients, with sigmoid colon in 4, with ileon in 3 and with the
ileocecal segment in 1. Twelve (60%) of the augmented patients
had a Mitrofanoff conduit which was made with appendix in 7 and
ureter in 5. Among the 8p without Mitrofanoff; 6 do CIC through
the urethra and 2 do not need CIC to empty their bladders. In the
augmented bladders, ureter reimplantation was performed into
the native bladder in all cases following the Lich-Gregoir technique
except for one, the patient with bladder agenesis.
In the control group (patients transplanted without an AC), 2p
were on CIC through a continent catheterizable stoma made with
appendix in one patient and with ureter in the other.
Urinary tract infections was defined by clinical symptoms
including pyrexia, loin pain, or deterioration of graft function
associated with a positive urine culture. Estimated glomerular fil￾tration rate (GFR) was calculated using the Schwartz formula (5).
Data including age at transplant, allograft source, urological
complications, UTI incidence, graft function and survival, and
patient survival were compared between the augmented group
and control group.
The immunosuppressive regime was similar in both groups
because all of these patients were transplanted in the same period
of time. It consisted of: antilymphocytic globulin or basiliximab
induction + cyclosporine or tacrolimus + steroids + azathioprine
or mycophenolate mofetyl.
This study was approval by the ethical committee of our hos￾pital. Qualitative and quantitative variables were analyzed by chi￾square and Student’s tests respectively. For analysis of the survival
rate, the Kaplan–Meier method and Mantel–Haenszel log-rank
test were used to compare the two groups. Statistical significance
was considered at p < 0.05.
RESULTS
There were no significant differences between the augmented
group and the control group in mean patient age at transplan￾tation, mean follow-up and mean age at the end of the study.
Grafts were obtained from cadaveric donors in 7 and from living
related donors in 13 children in AC and from cadaveric donors in
14 and living related donors in 10 children, in the control group
(Table 1). Two patients in each group had a previous failed kidney
transplantation due to immunological causes.
Surgical complications occurred only in two patients from
the control group who presented a ureteral stenosis in the early
postoperative period and were handled by doing a new ureteral
reimplantation and placement a ureteral pig-tail. None of these
complications affected graft function.
In the AC group, 7p (42%) hadVUR grades III–IV: on one of the
native kidneys in one of the patients, on the graft in two patients
and on both kidneys in the remaining four patients. Three patients

had a low grade VUR. Fourteen of the 20 patients in the AC group
have had 37 UTIs (7p with≥3 UTIs). Three (43%) of these patients
with ≥3 UTIs during the follow-up were non-compliant with CIC.
We did not find any significant difference in the incidence
of UTI between the type of bladder augmentation (uretero￾cystoplasty or enterocystoplasty) or whether the patient did CIC
through the Mitrofanoff conduit or through the urethra. However,
it is interesting that all the patients with VUR have had UTIs while
only 4p (28%) with UTI did not have VUR.
In the control group five patients (21%) had VUR grades III–
IV: on one of the native kidneys in 4p, and on both the graft and
the native kidney in the last patient. In this group eight children
have had 18 UTIs (3p with ≥3 UTIs). All patients with VUR have
had UTIs and three without VUR have also had UTIs. None of
the 16p who had never had UTIs had VUR on either their native
kidney or on the graft.
The incidences of UTI were 0.01 UTI/patient/year and 0.004
UTI/patient/year in the augmented group and controls, respec￾tively (p = 0.0001). Therefore, there is a significantly higher inci￾dence of UTI in the augmented group than in the control group.
However, UTI did not cause permanent graft function impair￾ment in any patient and none of patients lost the kidney graft due
to the UTIs.
Mean serum creatinine levels at the end of study were 1.1 ± 0.5
and 1.3 ± 0.5 mg/dl, in the AC group and the control groups,
respectively (p = 0.4). The estimated GFR at the end of study
was also similar for both groups; 92.9 ± 36.8 in the AC group
and 88.1 ± 28.2 ml/min/1.73 m2
in control group (p = 0.6). Three
renal grafts have been lost in the augmented group at a mean
follow-up of 10.6 ± 4.3 years and five in the control group at a
mean follow-up of 7.1 ± 4.7 years (p = 0.09). In all cases graft loss
were due to chronic graft dysfunction.
Patient survival in both groups was 100%. At 1, 5, and 10 years
after transplant graft survival was 100, 100, and 88.9% in the AC
group and 100, 90.5, and 84.8% respectively in the control group
(NS) Figure 1.
DISCUSSION
Patients with LUTD are usually managed according to their degree
of bladder dysfunction, as assessed by urodynamic studies and
imaging and most of these patients are identified and treated very
early, during infancy, to avoid their bladder dysfunction causing a
deterioration of RF.
In those patients in whom bladder dysfunction is not diag￾nosed until renal failure, pre-transplant evaluation, and surgical

transplantation compared to those transplanted without AC.
management are necessary to plan the preparation of an adequate
urinary reservoir with good capacity, compliance, and emptying
before the kidney transplant. When a AC is required in these
patients, ureterocystoplasty is preferable because it avoids the com￾plications observed with gastrointestinal segments (metabolic aci￾dosis, alkalosis, stones, intestinal obstruction, hematuria-dysuria
syndrome, malignization, etc.). However, an adequately dilated
ureter in a kidney without function is only feasible for a minor￾ity of patients. In this study 60% of patients had their bladder
augmented with ureter.
Unfortunately, although the experience with bio-engineered
implantable bladder substitutes that seek to provide low-pressure
storage is promising it is not yet a reality (6).
When planning an AC in ESRD patients with LUTD, the
patient’s ability to perform urethral catheterization must be evalu￾ated before the surgery. If the patient is not able to do CIC through
the urethra or this is painful, a Mitrofanoff or a Monti procedure
would be necessary to allow adequate bladder emptying. In this
study, 12p (60%) a continent catheterizable channel was necessary
to do the CIC.
It has been suggested that patients with LUTD and an AC may
present more urological complications and UTIs than other chil￾dren receiving a transplant, affecting RT outcome. Several studies
have evaluated RT outcome in relation to AC in children (1–4).
Most studies (2, 7–9) did not find any differences in the uro￾logical complication rates after transplant between patients with
LUTD, even when these patients had had their bladder augmented,
and patients without LUTD. According to some authors, ureteral
stenosis or fistulae could be more frequent when the graft’s ureter
is not implanted in the native bladder (4, 10).
In our study only two patients in the control group presented
a ureteral stenosis in the early postoperative period but neither of
these complications had a repercussion on graft function and in
all patients but one the ureter was implanted in the native bladder.
Recurrent UTIs are known to hasten deterioration of graft
function and some authors have suggested that graft recipients
with recurrent UTIs tend to have worse graft function although
their graft survival does not differ from that of the general
transplant population. Traxel et al. (2), in a recent study, com￾pared 17 patients undergoing AC and subsequent RT with a
control group of 17 on CIC who were transplanted without
AC. They did not find significant differences in the incidence
of UTI (0.07/year in the augmented group and 0.04 in the con￾trol group). Pereira et al. (3), compared a group of transplanted
patients with augmentation (23p) to a group without augmen￾tation (42p) and found an increased incidence of UTI in the
augmented group. However, if only symptomatic UTI was consid￾ered, the same number of patients in each groups (4p) developed
symptomatic UTI.
In our study there was a significantly higher incidence of UTI
in the augmented group than in the control group (0.01 vs. 0.004
UTI/patient/year). However, UTI did not cause permanent graft
function impairment in any patient and none of patients lost their
kidney graft due to UTI. According to the results of this study, the
risk of UTI in these patients is relates, in addition to immunosup￾pressive therapy, to the presence of native or graft kidney VUR and
to non-compliance with CIC but it is not related to the type of AC
or to if the patient did CIC through a Mitrofanoff conduit or the
urethra.
Many studies have demonstrated that there are no significant
differences in graft survival and function between patients with
reconstructed bladders and those with normal bladders. Graft
survival at 5 years ranges from 58 to 89% (2, 4, 10, 11), which is
similar to the overall graft survival at 5 years from cadaveric donors
(69.7%) and from living donors (82.6%), reported by NAPRTCS
2010 (12). Only the Basiri et al. study (4) found significant dif￾ferences in graft survival between the augmented and the control
groups (p = 0.03), but these differences were due to a higher inci￾dence of acute and chronic rejection in the augmented group
than in the control group (41 vs. 33%; 50 vs. 29%, respectively).
In our study we did not find any significant differences in graft
function and survival between the groups and the 10 years graft
survival was similar in both groups, 88.9 and 84.8%, respectively
(Figure 1).
Despite some limitations of the present study (it is retrospec￾tive, the number of patients is limited, only 2p were on CIC in
the control group) we can conclude that RT can be successfully
performed in children with LUTD and AC because there are no
significant differences in urological complications, graft function,
or survival between patients transplanted with AC or those without
AC. However, recurrent UTIs are more frequent in the AC patients
and these UTIs are related with non-compliance with CIC or the
presence of VUR but, in most, the UTIs will not lead to impaired
graft function.
