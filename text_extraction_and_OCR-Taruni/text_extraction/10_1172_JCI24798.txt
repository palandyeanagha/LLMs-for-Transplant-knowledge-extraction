Analysis of mononuclear cells in the adult mouse liver revealed that B cells represent as much as half of the
intrahepatic lymphocyte population. Intrahepatic B cells (IHB cells) are phenotypically similar to splenic B2
cells but express lower levels of CD23 and CD21 and higher levels of CD5.IHB cells proliferate as well as splen￾ic B cells in response to anti-IgM and LPS stimulation in vitro. VDJ gene rearrangements in IHB cells contain
insertions of N,P region nucleotides characteristic of B cells maturing in the adult bone marrow rather than
in the fetal liver. To evaluate whether B cells can have an impact on liver pathology, we compared CCl4-induced
fibrosis development in B cell–deficient and wild-type mice. CCl4 caused similar acute liver injury in mutant
and wild-type mice. However, following 6 weeks of CCl4 treatment, histochemical analyses showed markedly
reduced collagen deposition in B cell–deficient as compared with wild-type mice. By analyzing mice that have
normal numbers of B cells but lack either T cells or immunoglobulin in the serum, we established that B cells
have an impact on fibrosis in an antibody- and T cell–independent manner.
Introduction
The functions of the liver, such as removal of pathogens and anti￾gens from the blood, protein synthesis, and metabolism, require 
an immune response that is adapted to these tasks and is locally 
regulated. The liver is rich in immune cells. In addition to the pres￾ence of large numbers of resident macrophages (Kupffer cells), 
the liver contains T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells (1, 2). Interest￾ingly, no mention of B cells in the adult mouse liver is found in 
most reviews, even though embryonic liver is a well-studied site of 
origin for B cells and B lymphopoiesis persists in liver for 2 weeks 
after birth (3). B cells originating from the embryonic liver have 
the phenotype of B1 cells (CD5+, CD43+, Mac-1+), encode a par￾ticular set of B cell receptor specificities, reside mostly in the peri￾toneal cavity (PC) and the pleural cavity, and carry little, if any, N 
nucleotide insertions in their VDJ joints (4). All these features are 
distinctly different in B2 cells, the predominant population of B 
cells in the adult mouse (4).
Since little is known about B cells in the adult liver, we decided 
to look for adult mouse hepatic B cells and, if they were found, to 
characterize them phenotypically and with respect to their pos￾sible involvement in the response to liver injury. We chose the 
carbon tetrachloride–induced (CCl4-induced) liver degeneration 
model of liver disease to avoid targeted activation of a specific 
subset of lymphocytes a priori, as LPS or concanavalin A–induced 
liver damage stimulates B cells/macrophages or T cells, respec￾tively (5, 6). The hallmarks of chronic liver diseases, such as alco￾hol-induced liver degeneration, hepatitis C infection, and nonal￾cohol-induced steatohepatitis, are chronic inflammation, cellular 
damage, regeneration, and fibrosis. All of these features can be 
evoked by repeated CCl4-induced liver injury.
The hepatotoxicity of CCl4 is thought to involve 2 phases. First, 
CCl4 is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (expressed at high levels 
in centrilobular hepatocytes; ref. 7) to produce trichloromethyl 
radicals, which cause lipid peroxidation and membrane damage. 
The second phase is an inflammatory response launched by resi￾dent hepatic macrophages, the Kupffer cells, which upon activa￾tion, secrete cytokines, chemokines, and other proinflammatory 
factors (IL-18, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, eicosanoids, and NO). In 
addition to having direct cytotoxic effects, these factors attract and 
activate other monocytes as well as neutrophils and lymphocytes, 
which all contribute to tissue damage. Initial damage is followed 
by a phase of repair that includes a TGF-β–induced increase in 
collagen I (colI) production (8). Repeated cycles of injury, inflam￾mation, and repair result in fibrosis. Accumulation of colI occurs 
in the space between hepatocytes and endothelial cells, where it 
replaces a low-density basement membrane-like matrix containing 
colIV. This conversion of the subendothelial matrix to a matrix 
rich in fibrillar colI is a pivotal event mediating the loss of differen￾tiated functions characteristic of progressive liver disease.
In an alternative model, liver injury is induced by biliary toxin 
α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), mimicking biliary cirrhosis and 
sclerosing cholangitis (9). ANIT, similarly to CCl4, induces nonim￾mune cell–targeted hepatotoxicity followed by inflammatory and 
fibrotic responses, although at a different hepatic anatomic loca￾tion compared with CCl4.
Here we characterize intrahepatic B (IHB) cells with respect to 
cell phenotype, N nucleotide insertions at the VDJ junction, and 
their functional properties as well as describe a critical role for B 
cells in fibrotic liver disease models.

hematopoiesis in the developing embryo. However, little is known 
about hepatic B cells in the adult liver. We set out to phenotypi￾cally and functionally characterize IHB cells.
We quantified the proportion of IHB cells in a lymphocyte￾enriched population from PBS-perfused liver by staining for CD19, 
a B lineage–specific marker. In both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, B 
cells represent about 50% of intrahepatic (IH) lymphocytes (range 
30–60%; Figure 1A and data not shown). The absolute number of 
B cells isolated from a liver was approximately 2 × 106. CD19+ IHB 
cells were shown to express IgM, IgD, B220, MHCII, and CD62L at 
levels similar to their splenic counterparts (Figure 1, A and B, and 
data not shown). IHB cells do not express the CD43 and Mac-1 
markers typical for B-1 or immature B cells (data not shown). IHB 
cells express CD5 at a level higher than that detected on blood B 
cells but lower than observed on PC B cells (Figure 1B). Higher 
CD5 levels are indicative of conventional B cell activation (10). IHB 
cells express CD23 but at a lower level than splenic or blood B cells. 
CD21 surface expression is also slightly lower for IHB than for 
splenic B cells but higher than for blood B cells (Figure 1B). Taken 
together, with regard to expression of these markers, liver B cells 
are most similar to follicular splenic B cells.
Hepatic B cells are functionally competent. As liver is often regarded 
as a destination for dying lymphocytes (11), we tested whether IHB 
cells are proapoptotic using annexin V, which binds to phospholipid 
phosphatidylserine (PS) that translocates from the inner to the outer 
layer of the cellular membrane as cells undergo apoptosis. Annexin 
V bound up to 30% of hepatic B cells compared with approximately 
15% of splenic B cells (Figure 1C and data not shown). Thus, most 
liver B cells do not show a predisposition to apoptosis, and the high￾er number of apoptotic cells in liver compared with spleen might be 
related to differences in lymphocyte isolation.
The proliferative capacity of B lymphocytes in response to 
mitogenic and B cell receptor cross-linking stimuli is an impor￾tant functional characteristic that differs substantially for B cell 
subsets (12–14). We compared hepatic and splenic B cells for 
their extent of proliferation and upregulation of costimulatory 
molecules, such as CD86 (B7.2) and MHCII, in response to vari￾ous stimuli. The proliferative response of IHB cells was very simi￾lar to that of splenic B lymphocytes (Figure 1D); the response to 
Toll-like receptor 4, RP105, and CD40 stimulation is the same 
whereas response to IgM cross-linking is greater in the absence 
but not in the presence of IL-4. The difference noted may reflect 
better survival of IHB cells in culture without an exogenous sur￾vival factor like IL-4 and is consistent with an activated status 
of IHB cells suggested by CD5 upregulation (Figure 1B). A simi￾lar extent of upregulation of MHCII, CD86, and CD5, induced 
by tested stimuli, was demonstrated for liver and splenic B cells 
(Figure 1, B and D, and data not shown).

IHB cells resemble splenic B2 cells and are not of embryonic liver origin. B 
cells in adult liver may represent residual hepatic B cell generation 
from embryonic liver. Alternatively, IHB cells may be BM derived 
as are splenic B cells in an adult organism. To address the origin 
of IHB cells, we performed genetic analyses of their VDJ rearrange￾ments. Few insertions of nontemplated (N,P) nucleotides are seen 
in the VDJ junctions of neonatal B cells generated in the embry￾onic liver, which is similar to what has been reported for B1 cells 
(15–17). In contrast, adult splenic and blood B cells have extensive 
nontemplated nucleotide additions (18, 19). We compared CDR3 
sequences derived from pooled adult liver lymphocytes with those 
derived from splenic cells of 2-day-old mice or adult mouse blood 
B cells. Adult IHB cells markedly differed from neonatal B cells 
and resembled splenic B2 cells or recirculating blood B cells in 
their VDJ joint sequence (Tables 1 and 2). The average number of 
N,P nucleotides in neonatal B cells was 0.5 for the VD junction and 
0.1 for the DJ junction (Table 1). This is notably different from 
3.5 (or 4.5) for the VD and 4.4 (or 3.4) for the DJ junctions of B 
cells in the adult liver (or blood) (Table 2). Interestingly, adult liver 
and blood B cells also appeared different in the length of their VD
and DJ junctions; this difference is on the border of being statisti￾cally significant (P = 0.1, Student’s t test). IHB cells have fewer N,P 
nucleotides in their VD joints than in their DJ joints, the converse 
of what is reported for conventional adult B2 cells (18). The differ￾ence in the length of N,P insertions in the IHB and adult blood B 
cells might be a result of IHB cell selection. In addition, the differ￾ence strengthens the notion that liver B cells represent a true IH 
population with no significant contamination by peripheral blood 
B cells (see also Methods).
B cell role in hepatic fibrosis. Every CCl4 administration causes a 
pronounced necroinflammatory liver injury that is followed by a 
chronic repair response. This model has an advantage over many

The VHDHJH joints are shown from the codon encoding the second cysteine (position 104) of the VH gene and extending to the conserved glycine of the JH
region. The sequences were analyzed using DnaPlot. Nucleotides not encoded in the germline, called either N nucleotides (55, 56) or P nucleotides (57), 
are listed in the P,N column. Sequences of the IgH locus are categorized into productive (p) or nonproductive (np) in the Comments column and assigned 
VH family, DH element, and JH elements. DH sequences were assigned to published DH segments (58) if there was homology of at least 4 nucleotides. D? 
indicates that the respective D element could not be unambiguously assigned to a particular gene. Bolded text indicates P,N nucleotides.

widely utilized liver injury models (e.g., schistosome, LPS, ConA) 
because the toxic insult induces general hepatotoxicity rather 
than a priori targeting a defined part of the immune system. Yet 
we found B cells in the liver to be particularly sensitive to CCl4
application. IHB cell numbers dropped approximately 10-fold 1 
day after a CCl4 treatment as opposed to other IH lymphocytes 
(NKT cells, T cells), which remained unaffected at this time point 
(data not shown). By day 5 after a CCl4 injection, B cell numbers 
recovered (data not shown).
To test whether B cells have a role in liver injury and repair, we 
used B cell–deficient mice in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity stud￾ies. The B cell–deficient mouse strain chosen for analysis carries 
a targeted deletion in the JH region of the immunoglobulin heavy 
chain gene, which precludes assembly of a coding heavy chain gene 
and thus prevents B cell and antibody generation (20). These B 
cell–deficient mice will be referred to herein as JH–/– mice.
The extent of liver injury, assessed by the release of the hepato￾cyte-specific enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) into serum 
24 hours after a CCl4 treatment and by histological analysis, was 
similar in JH–/– and WT BALB/c mice (Figures 2A and 3; Supple￾mental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this 
article; doi:10.1172/JCI24798DS1). Interestingly, however, there 
was a large difference in the amount of collagen fibers accumulat￾ing; JH–/– mice had about 6- to 8-fold less interstitial collagen depo￾sition compared with WT mice 1 week after the sixth weekly dose 
of either 1.75 or 3.5 ml/kg CCl4 (Figure 2, B and C). No significant 
changes in the number or location of F4/80+ macrophages and 
α-SMA producing myofibroblasts were 
observed after 6 CCl4 treatments (data 
not shown). Thus, B cells appear indis￾pensable for the liver to develop fibrotic 
changes in response to CCl4.
To test whether B cell function is lim￾ited to the specific case of CCl4-induced 
injury or rather, plays a more general 
role in hepatic tissue repair, we induced 
hepatotoxicity with ANIT, as ANIT 
causes liver destruction by a mechanism 
distinct from that induced by CCl4. The 
hepatotoxicity induced by ANIT is mani￾fested as neutrophil-dependent necrosis 
of bile duct epithelial cells and hepatic 
parenchymal cells (21). After 8 weeks of 
ANIT treatment, we found that JH–/– had 
about 7 times fewer collagen deposits 
than WT mice (data not shown). Thus, 
fibrosis is reduced in the absence of B 
cells in at least 2 model systems.
To examine whether increasing B cell 
numbers above normal leads to more pro￾nounced fibrosis, we made use of B cell–
activating factor–Tg (BAFF-Tg) mice that 
show a 20–30% increase in B cell numbers 
(22) compared with the corresponding 
C57BL/6 WT control mice. Following 6 
CCl4 treatments, fibrosis developed in 
the BAFF-Tg and C57BL/6 controls. This 
fibrosis was characterized by less collagen 
fiber deposition than noted in BALB/c 
mice (data not shown and ref. 23). How￾ever, the BAFF-Tg mice had about twice the amount of collagen 
deposits as their WT C57BL/6 counterparts (Figure 2D).
B cell–deficient and WT mice respond differently to a single CCl4-
induced injury. To understand what acute effects trigger changes 
in collagen deposition after 6 weeks of treatment, the kinetics of 
tissue changes were analyzed in liver sections of B cell–deficient 
and control mice 1, 3, and 5 days after a single CCl4 challenge. 
Interestingly, TUNEL staining detecting apoptotic cells showed 
that despite similar initial injury at day 1, JH–/– mice cleared 
apoptotic cells completely by day 3, whereas in WT mice, some 
dying cells were still detected even 5 days after injury (Figure 3 
and Supplemental Figure 1). When staining sections for the tis￾sue macrophage–specific marker F4/80, we found that as early 
as day 1, there was a small increase in macrophage numbers in 
JH–/– compared with WT mice, which became very substantial by 
days 3 and 5 (Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 1). Thus, it seems 
that in the absence of B cells, macrophages are better able to clear 
dying hepatocytes. As the major cellular source for collagen fibers 
is a population of myofibroblasts (24), we also monitored α-SMA 
that marks activated hepatic stellate cells/myofibroblasts in the 
injured liver. Myofibroblasts were first detectable at day 3 at lev￾els similar to those in B cell–deficient and control mice. By day 5, 
however, WT mice showed many more myofibroblasts (Figure 3 
and Supplemental Figure 1). Higher efficiency of macrophages to 
remove dying hepatocytes may have reduced myofibroblast acti￾vation and eventually resulted in the lower collagen deposition. 
In a recent study (25), macrophages were shown to play distinct,

The degree of liver fibrogenesis is proportionate to B cell numbers. Mice were gavaged with 3.5 ml/kg 
(A and B and C, left panel) or 1.75 ml/kg (C, right panel, and D) of CCl4 or mineral oil. Each plot 
represents 1 experiment. (A) JH–/– and BALB/c WT control mice were bled 24 hours after a single 
CCl4 or oil administration, and ALT levels were measured. A representative experiment out of 3 is 
shown. (B–D) One week after the sixth weekly treatment of oil or CCl4, mice were sacrificed, and 
collagen-specific Sirius red staining of liver sections was performed to quantify interstitial collagen 
deposition in JH–/– and WT BALB/c mice (C) or in WT C57BL/6 and BAFF-Tg mice (D). Magnifica￾tion, ×50. In each case, a representative experiment out of at least 2 is shown. A column of dots 
represents a series of sections from 1 animal; mean values are depicted as red bars.

opposing roles during liver injury and repair. It appears that in the 
absence of B cells, those macrophages that contribute to recovery 
from inflammatory scarring are preferentially activated.
B cell–derived soluble factors have the potential to stimulate collagen 
production by activated hepatic stellate cells. To investigate whether 
soluble factors produced by activated B cells can directly affect 
proliferation and collagen production by myofibroblasts, we cul￾tured T6-HSC (26), a rat cell line derived from activated hepatic 
stellate cells, in the presence of supernatants from purified splen￾ic rat B cells activated with LPS. We chose LPS as the most likely 
agent reaching the liver of CCl4-gavaged mice through the portal 
system. LPS mimics polyclonal T cell–independent activation of 
B cells. We used human recombinant TGF-β, a known regulator 
of fibrogenesis, as a positive control. Proliferation was measured 
by [3H]-thymidine and de novo collagen synthesis by [3H]-proline 
incorporation (Figure 4). B cell supernatants induced increases 
in collagen synthesis similar to human TGF-β at 10 ng/ml with 
LPS having an intermediate effect (Figure 4). Thus, soluble fac￾tors produced by stimulated B cells can induce collagen synthe￾sis by hepatic stellate cells. However, the magnitude of in vitro 
response of already activated hepatic stellate cells (T6-HSC) to a 
known profibrogenic cytokine, TGF-β, is substantially less than 
that observed in vivo (data not shown). For this reason, we do not 
believe that use of a cell line is the optimal approach to unravel 
in vivo mechanisms of B cell–dependent effects of fibrogenesis. 
It is noteworthy that in vitro data do not rule out alternative B 
cell–mediated effects on HSCs, such as cell-cell interaction or 
indirect influence.
CD4+, CD8+, and γδ T cells do not influence hepatic fibrosis to a signifi￾cant degree. To assess whether mice deficient in T cells also have 
a defect in fibrogenesis, we performed a series of CCl4-induced 
liver injury experiments with mice that lack both B and T cells 
(RAG2–/–), CD4+ T cells (Aβ–/–), CD8+ T cells (β2m–/–), and γδT 
cells (TCRδ–/–). For every mouse mutant strain, a control strain of 
the same genetic background was used (Table 3). Of these, only 
RAG2–/– mice showed dissimilar amounts of collagen deposition 
following long-term treatment with CCl4 compared with appro￾priate WT counterparts (Figure 5 and data not shown). RAG2–/–
mice, lacking all lymphocytes that require DNA rearrangement 
to assemble their receptors, showed a 3- to 4-fold reduction in

interstitial collagen accumulation compared with WT mice (Fig￾ure 5B). This resembles the result obtained in mice lacking only 
B cells and does not imply a prominent role for T cells in the CCl4
model of liver fibrosis.
B cell role in liver fibrosis is antibody independent. B cells can mediate 
local effects, such as antigen presentation, cytokine release, and/or 
cell-cell contact regulated by costimulatory molecules, and long￾range effects via antibodies. As T cell–deficient animals (see above) 
did not show any differences in collagen deposition, B cell antigen 
presentation to T cells is unlikely to influence liver fibrosis.
To determine whether B cell regulation of liver fibrosis requires 
immunoglobulin production, we took advantage of 2 mouse 
strains that have normal numbers of B cells but either lack Ig in 
their serum or have Ig levels severely reduced. Mice expressing 
Epstein-Barr virus–derived protein LMP2a from a gene incorpo￾rated at the place of J elements of the IgH locus (DHLMP2a allele; 
ref. 27) lack both surface and circulating immunoglobulin whereas 
mice expressing mIgM-Tg on the JH–/– background encode surface 
but not secreted Ig (28).
As shown in Figure 6A, following 6 weekly treatments of 1.75 
ml/kg CCl4, similar levels of collagen deposition were noted in 
mice expressing Epstein-Barr virus–derived LMP2a protein and 
their WT BALB/cAnNCrlBr controls. Moreover, mIgM-Tg ( JH–/–) 
mice expressing surface but not secreted Ig (28) showed the same 
degree of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis as WT control BALB/c mice 
(Figure 6B). Thus, B cell effects on the pathology of CCl4-induced 
liver fibrosis are antibody independent. It is noteworthy that the 
degree of fibrosis in WT BALB/c mice in these experiments was 
lower than in previous ones (Figures 2, 5, and 6), possibly because 
of different housing conditions and/or concurrent infection of 
these animals. Both LMP2a and mIgM mouse colonies were posi￾tive for Helicobacter hepaticus; therefore, these mice as well as corre￾sponding WT strains were kept in quarantine facilities.
Discussion
In this work we demonstrate that IHB cells represent 
a sizable population with phenotypic and function￾al characteristics resembling those of conventional 
B2 cells. IHB cells express CD5 at somewhat higher 
levels than conventional B2 cells, and they prolifer￾ate better in response to IgM cross-linking without 
supplementing IL-4 in vitro (Figure 1), implying acti￾vated status of IHB cells. Despite the fact that adult 
liver has been known to contain c-kit+ pluripotent 
hematopoietic stem cells that could give rise to mul￾tilineage leukocytes (29, 30), most B cells in the adult 
liver appear to be BM-derived, in contrast to self￾propagating embryonic liver–derived B1 lineage cells 
(4). IHB cells are likely of BM origin; VDJ junctions 
of IHB cells contained extensive N nucleotide inser￾tions, with total average length similar to conven￾tional B2 cells (Tables 1 and 2). Notably, expression 
of terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT), 
the enzyme responsible for N nucleotide insertion, 
has not been studied in adult liver (31). Thus, the 
formal but unlikely possibility exists that adult liver 
B cells are generated in the liver with N nucleotide 
insertions (perhaps in a TdT-dependent fashion).
Here we show that B cells play an important anti￾body-independent role in the development of liver 
fibrosis, adding another disease model likely depen￾dent on local B cell function. In the presence of B cells, liver fibrosis 
develops to a much greater extent, indicating that B cells are non￾redundant participants in liver disease progression. An imperative 
role of B cells has also been demonstrated for autoimmune diabe￾tes in NOD mice. B cell–deficient NOD.Igµnull and B cell–depleted 
NOD mice did not develop insulitis or insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus, supporting the idea that B cells are critical for the initia￾tion and/or activation of autoreactive T cells (32, 33). B cells were 
also shown to be required for lupus nephritis in the polygenic, fas￾intact, and fas-deficient MRL models of systemic autoimmunity 
(28, 34, 35). In both cases, an antibody-independent mechanism 
turned out to be crucial for B cell involvement (28, 36).
In our experiments, we used mice constitutively devoid of B 
cells to study B cell involvement in fibrotic pathology. Although 
normal in gross physiology, B cell–deficient mice lack follicular 
dendritic networks (37–39), follicle-associated epithelium in the 
intestinal Peyer’s patches (40), and a noncanonical subset of NKT

Collagen production by T6-HSC can be stimulated by B cell–derived soluble fac￾tors. T6-HSC cells were seeded at 25% confluence in a 96-well plate in RPMI, 5% 
FBS, penicillin, streptomycin. After 24 hours, an equal volume of B cell–conditioned 
medium was added with [3H]-thymidine (to measure proliferation) or with [3H]-proline 
(to measure de novo collagen synthesis). After 18 hours, the amount of incorporated 
3H was quantified. Collagen synthesis per cell is expressed in arbitrary units; we took 
the ratio of radioactive counts of [3H]-proline/radioactive counts of [3H]-thymidine, con￾sidering this ratio equal to 1 in the absence of TGF-β. Each treatment was performed 
in triplicate. A representative experiment out of 3 is shown. (A) Human TGF-β that is 
recognized by rat TGF-β receptor was added at different concentration to the culture 
of T6-HSC cells. [3H]-thymidine incorporation is shown in red. Collagen synthesis as 
assessed by the rate of [3H]-proline incorporation is shown in blue. T6-HSC prolifera￾tion (B) and collagen synthesis relative to cell number as assessed by the ratio of [3H]-

days prior to harvesting supernatant. Red and blue bars show a mean from triplicate 
values; error bars show standard deviation.

cells (41). Mice lacking B cells also have defects in CD4+ T cell 
function (42) and perhaps some other as yet undescribed devel￾opmental/functional deficiencies. Thus, the results obtained with 
the B cell–deficient mice cannot alone be interpreted to indicate 
that B cells directly affect the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Since T 
cell–deficient mice do not show any difference in the development 
of liver fibrosis (data not shown), a CD4+ T cell defect is unlikely 
to account for the strongly attenuated liver fibrosis observed in 
the JH–/– mice. However, a B cell–dependent NKT cell subset that 
expresses Vα19 containing invariant TCR (41), resident in murine 
liver (43), might contribute to the reduced fibrosis noted in the 
B cell–deficient mice. NKT cells are known for their ability to 
respond in a rapid manner and to produce both TH1- and TH2-
type cytokines (44). Such qualities allow NKT cells to participate 
in immune response regulation (44). We did not find any pro￾nounced differences in liver fibrosis development in CD1–/– mice 
(data not shown) that lack conventional Vα14 TCR NKT cells. 
Unfortunately, there is no mouse mutant available that allows one 
to address the role of noncanonical Vα19 invariant NKT cells in 
liver fibrosis. Nonetheless, as RAG–/– animals show inhibition of 
fibrosis to an extent similar to that of B cell–deficient mice, a role 
for cell types that require gene rearrangement for their develop￾ment (B and T cells of various lineages) is implied. Thus, together 
the data suggest that either non-CD1 restricted NKT cells that 
require B cells for their development (41) or B cell autonomous 
function has a role in the fibrosis manifested in the CCl4-induced 
hepatotoxicity model.
By using 2 previously generated mouse strains (LMP2a inser￾tion and mIgM-Tg mice) deficient in immunoglobulin production, 
we have shown that antibodies are not required to develop CCl4-
induced liver fibrosis. LMP2a mice have normal B cell numbers and 
completely lack both secreted antibodies and surface expression of 
immunoglobulin (27). LMP2A does not only mimic BCR signaling, 
but triggers additional signaling pathways (45, 46). To eliminate 
the possibility that the effects observed in LMP2a mice are com￾pensated for by LMP2a signaling, we assessed fibrogenesis in the 
mIgM-Tg (JH–/–) mice. mIgM-Tg (JH–/–) mice express a surface Ig recep￾tor and have 300- to 500-fold reduced antibody titers compared 
with normal mice (28). Both mouse lines developed liver fibrosis 
to an extent similar to that of controls. Thus, the B cell role in liver 
fibrosis pathology appears to be antibody independent, suggesting 
that it is mediated by functions (e.g., cytokine secretion and/or cell￾cell contact) of local B cells as opposed to potentially long-range 
effects mediated by B cells localized elsewhere in the organism. An 
antigen presentation role for B cells is unlikely to play a significant 
role in liver fibrosis as mice deficient in conventional T cells show 
fibrogenesis similar to that of their WT counterparts. Moreover, 
LMP2a B cells do not have the ability to bind, internalize, and pres￾ent antigens because they lack B cell receptors on the surface. Yet 
LMP2a mice develop collagen deposits similar to those of WT mice. 
Together, these data suggest that liver tissue repair is affected by 
local B cell function, which may be mediated in part by the IHB

cells defined herein. Formally, it is possible that B cells overwhelm 
clearance mechanism(s) in the liver. However, B cell numbers are 
very small compared with hepatocyte numbers.
Our results are in agreement with reports that the degree of hepat￾ic damage in response to CCl4 was significantly milder in splenec￾tomized compared with sham-operated rats (47) and in SCID mice 
on BALB/c background compared with appropriate controls (23). 
However, liver fibrosis induced by the Schistosoma mansoni parasite is 
increased in B cell–deficient compared with control mice (48). The 
differences in the fibrosis induction mechanism by repeated hepa￾tocyte damage (as is the case for CCl4 and ANIT) or by low-level 
worm infection could explain the discrepancy.
B cell function has also been associated with fibrosis in human 
skin and lung. B lymphocyte gene signature characterizes skin 
biopsies from systemic sclerosis patients (49). Moreover, a B cell 
line established from the lung tissue of a patient with scleroderma 
exhibits augmented proliferation and inflammatory responses 
that are likely to lead to fibrotic changes (50).
In sum, this study describes the isolation and characterization of 
B cell populations in adult liver and directly demonstrates an indis￾pensable role of B cells in tissue repair following hepatic injury.
Methods
Mice. Unless otherwise stated, mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free 
mouse facility at Biogen Idec. All animal procedures were approved by Biogen 
Idec’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male mice of different 
strains (Table 3) had to weigh 20 g or more and be at least 6 weeks of age to 
be included in the study.
CCl4 and ANIT injury models. A mix of CCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich) with mineral 
oil (Sigma-Aldrich) was delivered by gavage in approximately 0.2 ml with a 
20-gauge animal-feeding needle. Experiments were performed using a 3.5 
ml/kg or 1.75 ml/kg dose of CCl4. The latter dose was preferred because 
it reduced morbidity/mortality and still induced changes in serum ALT 
levels and collagen deposition comparable to the higher dose. For a long￾term experiment, mice were gavaged once a week for 6 weeks. Short-term 
experiments included one CCl4 administration. ANIT (Sigma-Aldrich) was 
dissolved in mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) at 30 mg/ml. Mice were gavaged 
with 50 mg/kg twice a week for 8 weeks.
Serum ALT levels were measured 24 hours after CCl4 administration. 
One week after the 6th weekly gavage or on the indicated day after a single 
gavage, mice were sacrificed and 3 different liver lobes were taken from 
each mouse and incubated in 4% PFA in PBS for 2 days prior to embedding 
for immunohistochemical analysis.
Liver lymphocyte isolation. Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. The 
hepatic portal vein was cannulated with a 25-gauge needle and perfused 
with 10 ml of cold PBS. After removal of the gall bladder, the liver was cut 
into segments and passed through a 70-µm mesh cell strainer (BD Falcon; 
BD) in 50 ml of ice-cold RPMI, 5% FBS. The liver slurry was centrifuged at 
300 g for 10 minutes at 4°C in a 50-ml tube per liver. The pellet was resus￾pended in 10 ml of 0.02% collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI 1640 and 
left for 45 minutes at 37°C. Ice-cold RPMI, 5% FBS (30 ml) was added to 
each tube, then centrifuged for 3 minutes at 30 g. The pellet was discarded. 
The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 300 g at 4°C. The cell 
pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold RPMI 1640 (or in 45% Percoll 
[Amersham Biosciences]) and underlaid with 24% metrizamide (Sigma￾Aldrich) in PBS (or with 70% Percoll, respectively). A centrifugation at 1000 g
for 20 minutes at 4°C followed. Lymphocytes at the interface were har￾vested, washed with RPMI, 5% FBS, and used for further analyses.
The degree of IH lymphocyte contamination by blood lymphocytes is 
likely minimal, as the results (Tables 1 and 2 and data not shown) indicate 
a liver-specific increase in NKT cells and a different ratio of N nucleotide 
insertions at the VD and DJ junctions in IHB lymphocytes (3.5 and 4.4) 
compared with blood B cells (4.5 and 3.4; see also Results).
Isolation of lymphocytes from spleen, blood, and PC. Spleens were minced 
through a nylon mesh (Cell Strainer, BD Falcon; BD) to obtain single cell 
suspensions in DMEM, 5% FCS, and 2 mM l-glutamine. Erythrocytes were 
lysed by incubating in lysis buffer (140 mM NH4Cl, 17 mM Tris-HCl, pH 
7.65) for 3 minutes on ice. Blood was collected in EDTA-containing tubes 
(BD Biosciences — Pharmingen). To isolate blood lymphocytes, 200 µl of 
blood was underlaid with Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) and cen￾trifuged at 1000 g at room temperature for 20 minutes. Lymphocytes were 
collected from the interface. The PC was washed with 5 ml of DMEM, 5% 
FCS, and 2 mM l-glutamine to collect PC leukocytes. Following these pro￾cedures, lymphocytes were washed twice in DMEM, 5% FCS by 300 g cen￾trifugation at 4°C and resuspended in PBS/BSA/azide for flow cytometric 
analysis or in cell culture medium for proliferation studies.
Purification of rat B cells and T6-HSC culture. Splenocytes from 4-month-old 
Sprague-Dawley rats were purified using negative selection with anti-rat 
CD43 MACS beads according to manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Bio￾tec). B cells (>95% purity, data not shown) were seeded at 3 × 106 cells/ml in 
RPMI 1640, 5% FCS, β-mercaptoethanol, l-glutamine and cultured for 3.5 
days with or without 4 µg/ml of Ultrapure LPS (InvivoGen.).
T6-HSC cells were seeded at 25% confluence in a 96-well plate in RPMI, 
5% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin 24 hours later and an equal volume of B 
cell–conditioned medium was added with [3H]-thymidine to measure pro￾liferation or with [3H]-proline to measure collagen synthesis. After 18 hours, 
the amount of incorporated 3H was quantified. Each treatment was per￾formed in triplicate.
Flow cytometry. Fluorescence staining was performed as previously 
described (51). Annexin V, 7AAD, and antibodies specific for IgM, IgD, 
CD19, CD23, CD5, CD69, CD86, B220, MHCII, CD43, Mac-1, CD4, CD8, 
(BD Biosciences — Pharmingen), or CD21 (eBioscience) were used. Anti￾bodies were conjugated to FITC, PE, allophycocyanin (APC), peridinin 
chlorophyll protein (PerCP), Cy-Chrome, or biotin. Biotinylated antibod￾ies were detected with streptavidin conjugated to PerCP. Stained cells were 
fixed and analyzed using FACScalibur (BD Biosciences).
In vitro stimulation of CFSE-labeled B cells. To generate a stock solution, 
CFSE (Invitrogen Corp.) was dissolved to 5 mM in DMSO and stored at –
80°C. Splenic B cells were MACS purified by enrichment with MACS beads 
coupled to the anti-B220 antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec) on the LS magnetic 
columns (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Cells were then washed twice with RPMI 1640, resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/
ml in a 5-mM concentration of CSFE in warm RPMI 1640 for 10 minutes at 
37°C, washed 3 times in RPMI 1640, 5% FCS, resuspended in RPMI 1640, 
5% FCS, β-mercaptoethanol, l-glutamine at 2 × 105/100 µl, and transferred 
into a flat-bottom 96-well plate in 100 µl/well. Another 100 µl RPMI was 
added that contained stimulating reagents at 2 times final concentration. 
The stimuli used were pure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgM (2.5 µg/
ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.), IL-4 (25 U/ml; R&D Sys￾tems), anti-mouse CD40 antibodies (0.25 µg/ml; eBioscience), anti-RP105 
antibodies (10.5 µg/ml; eBioscience), or LPS (20 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunohistochemistry. Antibodies specific for α-SMA (clone 1A4, Dako￾Cytomation) were used at 1:50 dilution with 30 minutes incubation. Heat￾induced epitope retrieval pretreatment of tissue sections was performed 
in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 30 seconds at 125°C, kept at 90°C for 
10 seconds, and cooled to room temperature for an additional 20 min￾utes prior to immunostaining. Binding of primary antibodies to tissue 
elements was detected using an MM Biotinylation Kit (Biocare Medical), 
with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. Slides were counterstained 
with Mayer’s hematoxylin for 1 minute.

F4/80-specific antibodies (clone CI:A3-1, Serotec Inc.) were used at 20 
µg/ml. Tissue sections were pretreated with proteinase K (DakoCytoma￾tion) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Binding of primary antibodies was 
detected using a Vector Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories,) using DAB sub￾strate. Slides were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin for 1 minute.
TUNEL staining was performed using an ApopTag In Situ Apoptosis 
Detection kit (Chemicon International) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Labeled apoptotic cells were detected using DAB/nickel chlo￾ride as the substrate. Slides were counterstained for 5 minutes with methyl 
green (Vector Laboratories). Collagen fibers were detected using Sirius red 
stain (52); H&E staining was performed as previously described (53).
PCR and Ig gene rearrangement analysis. DNA was extracted from cells posi￾tively selected on CD19+ magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the 
genomic DNA isolation kit (QIAGEN) manufacturer’s protocol. DNA (2 µl, 
equivalent of about 103 B cells) was used for amplification of the VDJ joints. 
Two rounds of amplification were performed using VHA, VHB, and VHE 
5′ primers specific for J558L, Q52, and 7183 VH families; JH4E 3′ primer 
(54) was used for the first and nested JH1 or JH4A 3′ primers for the sec￾ond rounds. All primers were synthesized at Biogen Idec. Twenty cycles were 
performed for the first round (1 minute at 95°C, 1 minute at 60°C, and 1.5 
minutes at 72°C); 30 cycles (1 minute at 95°C, 1 minute at 63°C, and 1.5 
minutes at 72°C) were performed for the second round, using 2 µl of the 
first-round reaction as a template. The expected 0.4-kb fragment was puri￾fied from the gel and subcloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen 
Corp.). DNA from individual colonies was prepared and sequenced using 
standard vector specific primers. Sequences were analyzed using the pro￾gram DnaPlot (www.dnaplot.de).
Interstitial collagen quantification. A total of 3 sections from the liver (each 
from a different lobe) were stained for each animal. Black and white pictures 
of Sirius red staining were made in polarized light at ×50 magnification. 
Pictures were made so that liver tissue occupied the whole area captured 
by the camera to ensure that total image area was identical in each picture 
(4–10 pictures per animal). Vessels constitutively containing collagen were 
electronically removed from each image. Next, the amount of white stain￾ing (interstitial collagen) was quantified by MetaMorph image analysis 
software (Universal Imaging Corporation). Quantification is displayed in 
arbitrary units (1 correlates to 1000 pixels). The absolute amount of white 
area cannot be directly compared among different experiments because it 
varied with the intensity of Sirius red staining.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using internal Microsoft 
Excel (Microsoft Corp.) statistical functions.
