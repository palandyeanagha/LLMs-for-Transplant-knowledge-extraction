ABSTRACT
This review critically appraises the data emerging from
small retrospective and prospective cohort studies
suggesting that patients with the autosomal dominant
acute porphyrias may be at increased risk of
hepatocellular cancer (HCC), hypertension (HT) and renal
impairment. The most striking finding is a marked excess
risk of HCC in Swedish patients with acute intermittent
porphyria (AIP). As Sweden has a relatively high
prevalence of AIP due to a founder effect, it is uncertain
to what extent the finding is generalisable to other
populations or other acute porphyrias and whether early
intervention through screening can improve outcomes.
As yet there is no evidence for the cost-effectiveness of
systematic surveillance for HCC in acute porphyria
outside Sweden. Data from several populations also
suggest a high prevalence of chronic sustained HT and
renal impairment in AIP, but it is uncertain if this
represents a true excess risk, in particular for
asymptomatic patients. As these long-term complications
are important and potentially treatable, a pragmatic
recommendation is that symptomatic patients with acute
porphyria should be offered specialist long-term follow-up
and, for those aged >50 years, annual liver ultrasound
may be considered following discussion of the likely risks
and benefits. Opportunistic cardiovascular risk
assessment can readily be incorporated into a structured
annual review so that appropriate drugs safe for use in
acute porphyria are prescribed promptly. As these
diseases are rare, collaborative international
epidemiological studies such as those being coordinated
through the European Porphyria Network are essential to
inform best clinical practice.
INTRODUCTION
The porphyrias are a family of disorders that each
result from a specific enzyme deficiency (inherited
or acquired) in the haem biosynthetic pathway.
There are three types of autosomal dominant
inherited porphyrias that may present with acute
neurovisceral attacks: acute intermittent porphyria
(AIP), variegate porphyria (VP) and hereditary
coproporphyria (HCP). To date, there is a lack of
robust epidemiological studies of the incidence and
prevalence of these disorders in most countries.
The prevalence of the genetic defects in European
populations is estimated as 1–2:10 000 for AIP,
1:30 000 for VP and <1:50 000 for HCP (personal
communication, Dr M Badminton, Cardiff
Porphyria Centre). In Sweden the prevalence of
AIP is much higher due to a founder effect, with a
single common mutation of the hydroxymethylbi￾lane synthase (HMBS) gene, W198X, accounting
for more than half the cases.1 Similarly, in South
Africa, VP has an estimated gene prevalence of
1–2:1000 of the European immigrant population
and approximately 95% carry a single mutation,
R59W, in the protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene.2 In
contrast, the European population is genetically
very heterogeneous with many private mutations
identified in AIP, VP and HCP. In all three disorders
penetrance is low, so only a minority of patients
inheriting a mutation will experience acute attacks
which, if not recognised and promptly treated,
may be life-threatening and sometimes result in
permanent neurological complications.
Accurate methods for diagnostic testing of
family members, good education of patients and
doctors about known precipitants and more effect￾ive modern management are all important factors
that nowadays contribute to reduced mortality
and morbidity from acute porphyria attacks. Thus,
more attention needs to be focused on the poten￾tial for long-term complications as the life expect￾ancy of affected patients improves. Since the acute
porphyrias are rare diseases there are only a limited
number of small, mostly retrospective, studies that
address this issue. The most convincing data
concern hepatocellular cancer (HCC), hypertension
(HT) and renal impairment, and these studies are
reviewed in this paper.
PRIMARY HEPATOCELLULAR CANCER (HCC) IN
ACUTE PORPHYRIA
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP)
The first reports of a link between AIP and HCC
appeared in 1984 from the Swedish population.3 4
Several subsequent analyses of Finnish, Swedish
and Danish patient populations have provided
further evidence of a substantially increased inci￾dence of HCC relative to expected rates in the
general population.5–9 The extent of overlap of
subjects included in this series of studies is not
clear. One retrospective study of mortality in a US
population of 136 patients with AIP over a 50-year
period did not identify any cases of HCC, but
follow-up data were not available in 22% of this
cohort.10 An increased incidence of HCC has also
been reported for patients with AIP in a larger pro￾spective study in France.11 In Switzerland, two
cases of HCC occurred among 205 subjects with
AIP diagnosed during a 15-year period.12 A recent
prospective study of the incidence of HCC in

acute porphyria in five European countries identified 14 new
cases (11 AIP, 3VP) over a 3-year period. Eleven of these
patients were from Sweden, including four patients with latent
AIP, giving a 63-fold greater incidence per million inhabitants of
this complication of AIP in Sweden than in the other countries
(France, Netherlands, Switzerland, UK) (unpublished data from
the European Porphyria Network project supported by the
European Commission DGSANCO, 2012).
While the absolute numbers of HCC cases in each of these
studies are small, where calculated, the differences between the
expected and observed incidence rates are striking (table 1).
In addition to the cohort studies, individual case reports
linking AIP and HCC have been published13–16 but at least
some of these subjects may also have been included in other
publications.
Importantly, HCC appears to occur in patients with and
without evidence of liver cirrhosis17 and, in the French series, the
tumours were associated with factors such as encapsulation,
favouring successful resection.11 In the most recent Swedish
report,9 cirrhosis was rarely present among the 22 patients with
HCC identified during the prospective study period and there was
no evidence that other risk factors such as alcohol or viral hepa￾titis were implicated. There was a female preponderance and 73%
of the AIP gene carriers developing HCC had experienced previous
acute porphyria attacks. This study was conducted in a region
with an exceptionally high background prevalence of AIP with a
predominant single founder mutation (W198X).
The mechanism of carcinogenesis in AIP is unknown.
Hypotheses proposed include direct carcinogenicity of
aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), reduced scavenging of free radicals
due to reduced haem-containing antioxidant enzymes in liver
cells and direct or indirect effects of HMBS mutations on tran￾scription of tumour suppressor genes.11 16–19 As the total
numbers of cases are so small, no relationship between increased
HCC risk and particular HMBS mutations has been demon￾strated to date.
Variegate porphyria (VP)
Evidence linking HCC to VP is more limited. Most cohort
studies published to date have identified only single cases. There
is a small number of published case reports,20–22 but some are
the individuals identified in the cohort studies. In at least one
published case VP was only diagnosed because of the develop￾ment of skin lesions in a patient presenting with advanced
HCC. The Finnish series included 61 patients with VP, of whom
one died of HCC.5 6 In contrast, seven cases of HCC were identi￾fied in 145 patients with AIP in this study. In the French pro￾spective series, one case of HCC occurred in a population of 136
patients with VP during the follow-up period compared with
five cases from 430 patients with AIP.11 A report from
Switzerland has identified two cases among 37 patients diag￾nosed with VP.12 It is notable that no link between VP and HCC
has been reported from the South African population where
there is a relatively high prevalence of the disease.
Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP)
There is a single case report of HCC occurring in association
with HCP.23 The same authors identified one patient with

HCP and HCC in the prospective French study,11 although it is
not absolutely clear if this is the same individual.
In summary, a significantly increased risk of HCC has been
demonstrated for patients with AIP in prospective cohort
studies from Scandinavian and French populations which is
particularly marked in the Swedish population. A similar
increased risk cannot be ruled out for other populations or
other acute porphyrias, although the evidence is much weaker
with more limited numbers of cases being identified in associ￾ation with VP and only one with HCP.
Screening for HCC in patients with acute porphyria
The emergence of reports linking HCC with acute porphyria
(mainly AIP) have led some porphyria experts to propose sur￾veillance of all acute porphyria gene carriers aged >50 years
and, conversely, that evidence of an underlying acute porphyria
should be sought in any patient presenting with HCC in the
absence of cirrhosis.24
The answers to the following questions are unknown for
most European populations:
▸ Is the natural history of HCC in acute porphyria influenced
by early diagnosis?
▸ What are the risks and benefits of any proposed screening method
in patients with asymptomatic and overt acute porphyria?
Given the rarity of acute porphyria, these questions are likely
to remain unanswered and it is necessary to extrapolate from
other data to make pragmatic recommendations.
In other settings, resection of early HCC lesions detected
through surveillance is reported to have a good prognosis,25 and
UK clinical guidelines recommend routine surveillance for HCC
among individuals with cirrhosis.26 In drawing comparisons, it
should be remembered that the pathology of HCC in acute por￾phyria may be very different, given the apparent lack of associ￾ation with prior cirrhosis.
The optimal screening strategy for HCC in other high-risk
conditions remains under debate. A UK evaluation of a variety
of surveillance algorithms using serum α-fetoprotein (AFP)
and/or ultrasound at 6- and 12-monthly intervals in a mixed
aetiology cohort suggests that such surveillance is both clinic￾ally effective and cost-effective, although the economic effi￾ciency in patients with prior cirrhosis is predicted to vary
markedly with the aetiology.27
Following the recognition of the unexpectedly high incidence
of HCC in patients with AIP in Sweden, surveillance of AIP
gene carriers aged >55 years was introduced in one county in
Northern Sweden in 1994. Improved 3-year and 5-year survival
was reported in patients who participated in screening at inter￾vals of 1–1.5 years compared with those who did not.9 These
authors comment that lead time bias may have influenced their
results. They also state that AFP was not helpful and recom￾mend liver ultrasound as a first-line screening test.
Although this is an important study, it must be acknowledged
that the benefits of early diagnosis through systematic surveil￾lance remain speculative in other more genetically heteroge￾neous populations with a lower background prevalence of acute
porphyria and incidence rates of HCC. It must also be recog￾nised that any form of screening has the potential to do harm,
for example, by causing anxiety to otherwise asymptomatic
individuals and the generation of false positive screening tests.
HYPERTENSION (HT) AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT IN ACUTE
PORPHYRIA
Several case series and cohort studies (mostly retrospective)
propose that there is an increased risk of chronic sustained HT
and renal failure in patients with acute porphyria.28–33 Almost
all the available data relate to AIP (table 2). Within these
studies, small numbers of other renal diseases such as diabetes,
polycystic kidneys and systemic lupus erythematosus have also
occurred coincidentally.
The definitions of HT and methods for identifying renal
impairment differ between studies. Andersson et al defined HT
based on the prescription of any antihypertensive drug and, in
the later population-based study, assessed both creatinine clear￾ance and chromium EDTA clearance as measures of glomerular
filtration rate.31 32 Others have used differing cut-off values for
blood pressure and a variety of measures of renal function or
merely reported clinical diagnoses or recorded deaths due to
renal failure. This imposes a serious limitation on the validity
of combining data from these studies
Chronic HT is undoubtedly a common accompaniment to
AIP, particularly those with overt disease. However, it is also
common in the general population. In the case–control study
by Andersson et al, HT was significantly increased in overt AIP
relative to controls and latent AIP (defined as those who had
never had symptoms).31 Patients with latent AIP did not differ
significantly from their controls (28% of whom had HT). In a
retrospective Finnish cohort, HT was higher than the expected
rate in the non-porphyric population, but only in certain age
groups (table 2).6
Some studies have reported higher than expected rates of
renal failure (including deaths from this cause), but this is not
a consistent finding. This may be due to differences in ascer￾tainment or small numbers of cases (table 2).
There are a number of individual case reports describing renal
transplantation in patients with AIP.33–36 A variety of morpho￾logical lesions have been reported in renal biopsies from AIP
subjects with renal failure. These include both glomerular scler￾osis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. In some studies, evidence
of analgesic nephropathy was specifically sought but not con￾firmed. One recent study examined renal biopsies in nine AIP
patients with renal impairment without HT and found no
glomerular lesions but tubulointerstitial nephritis.37
Proposed mechanisms for the renal damage include ischaemic
insults due to vasospasm during acute attacks, nephrotoxicity
of ALA or other porphyrin intermediates and the effects of sus￾tained chronic HT.32 37
In summary, chronic sustained HT is prevalent in AIP and
some studies have reported an increased risk of chronic renal
impairment leading to end-stage renal failure. There is a
paucity of data for other forms of acute porphyria. The risk of
renal failure may be correlated with the occurrence of HT
during acute attacks. Despite the high prevalence of chronic
HT, the available studies have not demonstrated an increased
risk of cardiovascular mortality. As the background risk of both
HT and cardiovascular disease in the population is high, accur￾ate detection of the true excess risk in patients with acute por￾phyria is difficult.
Opportunistic screening for modifiable cardiovascular risk
factors such as blood pressure and reduced estimated glomeru￾lar filtration rate is essentially non-controversial and has been
widely adopted in many other clinical groups. Treatment of
these risk factors is no less likely to confer benefit for patients
with acute porphyria provided that only drugs identified as safe
for use in acute porphyria are prescribed.
CRITICAL APPRAISAL SUMMARY
The studies available to date are principally cohort studies,
case–control studies and case series, corresponding to evidence

Levels 2b, 3b and 4, respectively, according to the hierarchy
defined by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.38
In assessing this literature, the following points have been
considered:
1. The populations are mostly well-defined and characterised
with respect to porphyria diagnosis.
2. In three prospective studies the follow-up periods were
between 7 and 18 years and data were complete for >86%
of eligible subjects.
3. Absolute numbers of patients identified with HCC are
small. Confounding risk factors such as alcohol and viral
hepatitis were considered in some but not all of the studies.
4. Definitions of HT and renal impairment are not consistent
between studies. Confounding risk factors such as alcohol,
weight and smoking have not been systematically addressed
in all studies.
5. Combination of data from all the studies may not be valid
as the extent of overlap of individual subjects included in
sequential publications from the same authors is unclear.
6. Selection bias (systematic error) in identifying cohort groups
cannot be excluded; for example, patients attending porphy￾ria centres may have different characteristics from those
managed in non-specialist settings.
7. The results from populations that are relatively genetically
homogeneous (eg, Sweden) may not be generalisable to
other more heterogeneous populations (eg, the UK).
RECOMMENDATIONS
▸ Currently there is no evidence that screening for HCC in
patients with acute porphyria (whether overt or asymptom￾atic) is likely to be cost-effective in any country other than
Sweden.
▸ Clinicians should be aware of the reports of HCC as a late
complication of acute porphyria and should consider this
diagnosis in the following circumstances:
– in any patient with acute porphyria with unexplained
abnormal liver function tests or symptoms and signs sug￾gestive of underlying liver disease or malignancy;
– in patients who develop manifestations of acute porphyria
(skin lesions or acute attacks) after the age of 50 years,
particularly for the first time or after a period of latency.
▸ Periodic (annual) ultrasound should be considered for indivi￾duals aged >50 years with previous overt or asymptomatic
disease who ask to be tested after careful discussion of the
likely risks and benefits.
▸ Available evidence does not support screening for renal com￾plications in asymptomatic acute porphyria gene carriers.
▸ Measurement of blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtra￾tion rate and proteinuria (early morning spot urine albumin:
creatinine or protein:creatinine ratio) should be incorporated
as part of the annual structured review of adult patients fol￾lowed up because of previous or current overt acute
porphyria.
▸ Management of HT should follow a treatment algorithm
modified to use agents known to be safe in acute porphyria.
Similar considerations apply to the management of other car￾diovascular risk factors that may be identified, such as
hyperlipidaemia.
▸ If progressive renal impairment (with or without protein￾uria) is identified, local guidelines for risk factor management
and referral to renal services should be followed, adopting a
shared care approach, so that special factors relevant to the
management of acute porphyria are considered (particularly
in relation to prescribing).

CONCLUSIONS
The data presented have acknowledged limitations but draw
attention to important late complications of acute porphyria,
supporting the provision of specialist long-term follow-up to
detect and treat these effectively. As with other rare diseases,
there are genuine difficulties in applying tools such as
large-scale evaluations of formal screening programmes.
Resources available to provide systematic ascertainment and
specialist long-term follow-up of patients with acute porphyria
differ markedly, even in highly developed European healthcare
systems. There is an urgent and ongoing need to improve our
understanding of the evolving natural history of acute porphy￾ria and to clarify the influence of genotype on long-term out￾comes. This is most likely to be achieved by international
collaboration in epidemiological studies and the development of
disease registers such as those planned by the European
Porphyria Network.39
KEY MESSAGES
▸ An excess risk of hepatocellular cancer in acute porphyria
has been reported in several European populations,
particularly marked in Swedish patients with acute
intermittent porphyria (AIP)
▸ Hypertension and chronic renal impairment are also reported
as late complications of AIP
▸ The true excess risk of these complications in all patient
populations and other types of acute porphyria is uncertain,
emphasising the need for collaborative epidemiological
studies in these rare conditions
