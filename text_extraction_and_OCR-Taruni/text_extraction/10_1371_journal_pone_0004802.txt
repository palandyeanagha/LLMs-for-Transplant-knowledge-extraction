Abstract
The incidence of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is approximately 50% higher in men than women. In order to understand
the molecular basis of this gender disparity, we examined sex specific gene expression patterns in control and diseased,
human and murine kidney samples. Using the Affymetrix platform we performed comprehensive gene expression analysis
on 42 microdissected human kidney samples (glomeruli and tubules). We identified 67 genes with gender biased expression
in healthy human kidneys and 24 transcripts in diseased male and female human kidneys. Similar analysis performed in mice
using male and female control and doxorubicin induced nephrotic syndrome kidneys identified significantly larger number
of differentially expressed transcripts. The majority of genes showing gender biased expression either in diseased human
and murine kidneys were different from those differentially expressed in healthy kidneys. Only 9 sexually dimorphic
transcripts were common to healthy human and murine kidneys and five showed differential regulation in both human and
murine diseased kidneys. In humans, sex biased genes showed statistical enrichment only to sex chromosomes while in
mice they were enriched to sex chromosomes and various autosomes. Thus we present a comprehensive analysis of gender
biased genes in the kidney. We show that sexually dimorphic genes in the kidney show species specific regulation. Our
results also indicate that male and female kidneys respond differently to injury. These studies could provide the basis for the
development of new treatment strategies for men and women with kidney disease.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects about 20 million adults
and it is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in the
United States [1,2,3]. Male gender affects the prevalence and
progression of renal disease and it is associated with a 50% higher
incidence of ESRD. A large meta-analysis (including 11,345
patients from 68 studies) performed recently indicates that patients
with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD), IgA
nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, or chronic renal disease
of unspecified etiology progress more quickly to ESRD [4]. The
difficult and clinically important question would be to determine
whether these gender differences are due to ‘‘environmental’’ co￾variants, sex hormone differences, inherent functional and
anatomical differences in male and female kidneys or due to their
differential injury response.
Similarly, in most animal models of chronic renal disease
(hypertension, renal ablation models and PKD), males show
accelerated progression of renal injury compared to females [5,6].
Animal studies suggest that sex hormones per se, rather than
genetically determined structural differences, cause the greater
susceptibility of male kidneys to progressive renal injury.
Hormonal manipulation studies suggest that female sex hormones
such as estradiol may slow the progression of renal disease,
whereas male hormones such as testosterone may promote disease
progression [7,8]. The biological effects of sex steroid hormones
are classically mediated by nuclear receptors. They either act as
ligand-activated transcription factors that bind to specific response
elements located on the promoters of target genes, or by tethering
to transcription factor complexes that contact DNA at alternative
sites [9,10]. Sex steroid hormones can also exert rapid non￾genomic effects including the activation of the MAP kinase
pathways [11,12].
In addition, to the effects mediated by sex-steroid hormones,
there is a possibility that the expression of sex chromosomal genes
might also contribute to sexual dimorphisms [13]. During
development, the presence of Y chromosome is critical for male
specification. To restore the balanced expression of X-linked genes

between sexes, gene dosage compensation mechanisms have
evolved. In females, large parts of one X-allele are silenced by
X-inactivation reducing gene dosage to male level, but some genes
escape X-inactivation [14,15,16,17]. It is also possible that, higher
expression level of X-chromosome genes in females might be
compensated by the expression of functionally equivalent Y￾chromosome genes in males. The human Y chromosome encodes
.100 genes, while only 23 protein coding genes have been
annotated on the murine Y-chromosome so far, indicating that
sexual dimorphisms of sex-chromosome-linked genes might be
species-specific. Y-chromosome genes have mainly been studied in
the context of male fertility and for the most part their role and
regulation is unknown [18].
Rinn et al. [19] performed one of the first gene expression
studies using Affymetrix arrays to determine whole genome scale
expression differences between male and female Swiss-Webster
mice. They found that the degree of sexual dimorphism in
different organs show large variations. Very few genes showed
differential expression in the hypothalamus, while the kidney had
the most sex-biased transcripts. The study by Rinn et al. identified
27 sexually dimorphic genes in murine kidneys with at least .3
fold (p,0.001) change [20]. The dominant classes of differentially
expressed genes detected in the study were monooxygenases,
involved in electron transport (including the biosynthesis and
metabolism of eiconasoids), transporters in the solute carrier family
and glucuronosyltransferases. The authors concluded that genes
involved in drug metabolism and renal function represent the
major molecular differences between mammalian sexes. A recently
performed comprehensive microarray analysis (using the Agilent
platform) of 334 mice (an F2 intercross between C57Bl/6J and
C3H/heJ strains) proposed that the extent of sexual dimorphism
in gene expression is greater than previously recognized [21]. Sex￾biased expression was detected for 72% (liver), 68% (adipose), 55%
(muscle) and 13.6% (brain) of all active genes (kidneys were not
examined). The expression of sex biased genes was highly tissue￾specific and was enriched not only on the sex chromosomes, but
also on chromosome 7, 13 and 19.
Given the high degree of baseline sexual dimorphism in the
kidney and the significant gender differences in renal disease
development, a systematic analysis of gender differences is of great
importance. Such analysis could provide insight into the
mechanism responsible for sex differences in renal disease
progression, drug metabolism and response. In addition, most, if
not all, large-scale gene expression studies to identify gender
specific gene expression pattern have been performed in rodents
under baseline condition. Sexually dimorphic gene expression in
renal diseases has not been analyzed. We also increasingly
recognize that gene expression studies performed in rodents
cannot be fully translated into humans, and that many genes show
discordant regulation in humans compared to rodents. To address
these issues we performed whole genome scale expression studies
in healthy and diseased human kidney samples and mouse models
of renal disease.
Results
Gene Expression Differences in Healthy and Diseased
Mouse Kidneys
We used AffymetrixM430A2.0 expression arrays to determine
global gene expression differences in kidneys of 10-week old
healthy Balb/c male and female mice (n = 5/group, Figure 1A).
Phenotypic description of the animals is shown on Figure 1. As
expected the body weight of male and female mice was different
and there was a minor but statistically significant difference in
baseline albuminuria (Figure 1A). We used the Significance
Analysis of Microarray data (SAM) [22] with a stringent false
discovery rate (FDR) of 0.3% and we identified 1,162 differentially
expressed transcripts between male and female kidneys. The
differentially expressed genes are listed in Supplemental Table S1.
The difference in gene expression level was relatively small and
half of the transcripts (468) showed less than 50% change in their
expression level (Figure 1C). (There was an equal distribution in
the differentially expressed genes that showed higher expression
level in males or females (Figure 1C).)
In order to identify gene expression differences in response to
injury, animals were injected with doxorubicin, a substance that is
known to induce albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in Balb/c
mice as it is directly toxic to podocytes [23]. Male mice developed
albuminuria as early as 7 days following the administration of
doxorubicin and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) was as high as
28,833614,498 mg/mg on day 14. The degree of albuminuria was
lower in female mice (ACR of 1,0536646 mg/mg)(Figure 1A). In
conjunction, the degree of glomerulosclerosis was also greater in
male mice compared to female mice (Figure 1B). To understand
the molecular mechanism of this differential injury response we
analyzed gene expression changes in diseased male and female
kidneys. The SAM analysis (FDR 0.3%) identified 884 differen￾tially expressed transcripts when we compared gene expression
profiles in diseased male and female kidneys (Figure 1C and Table
S2). We determined that 326 transcripts showed sexual dimor￾phism in both healthy and diseased kidneys (Figure 1E). We also
compared gene expression differences in control vs. doxorubicin
injected male mice and identified 23 differentially expressed
transcripts (Figure 1D, Table S3). Similar analysis comparing
control vs. doxorubicin injected female animals identified 28
differentially expressed genes (Figure 1D, Table S3). Strikingly, no
transcripts were found to be commonly differentially regulated
during the disease progression in males and females. The absence
of overlap indicates a differential injury pattern in male and female
mice (this analysis was first filtered for differentially expressed
genes within the same gender). The expression of the top
differentially regulated genes was confirmed by QRT-PCR and
relative gene expression levels showed excellent correlation
(r2
,0.9) to the microarray results (data not shown).
Gene Expression Differences in Healthy and Diseased
Human Kidneys Show Sexual Dimorphism
Next we analyzed sex biased gene expression differences in
control and diseased human kidneys. We collected 42 kidney
samples from healthy living transplant donors, nephrectomies and
from diagnostic kidney biopsies. Preliminary studies did not show
significant gene expression differences in control kidneys based on
the collection method (i.e. living kidney biopsy vs. unaffected
portion of tumor nephrectomy). We grouped the tissue samples
based on the histological readings of the kidney biopsies. Samples
with evidence of glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis were
assigned into the diseased group (Table 1). The research
population was notable for its diversity in both ethnicity and
etiology of renal disease, but their age, body weight, BMI and
renal function showed no statistical differences. Majority of the
participants had mild, Stage 3 CKD. The kidney tissue was
microdissected into glomerular and tubulointerstitial fractions and
AffymetrixU133 expression arrays were performed separately
[24]. Quality of the microdissection was determined by evaluating
the expression of glomerular specific genes (NPHS1, NPHS2, and
SYNPO). We included 52 good quality hybridizations into our
analysis.

First, we determined gene expression differences between
healthy male and female microdissected glomeruli. Statistical
analysis (Student t-test, p,0.01) identified 26 differentially
regulated transcripts in healthy glomeruli (Figure 2A, Table
S4A). Among them, 16 genes had sex-specific expression levels at a
fold-change threshold .1.5 and 11 genes showed .2-fold
differential expression level between sexes. Statistical analysis
identified 50 differentially expressed transcripts between sexes in
the tubulointerstitial compartment (Figure 2A and Table S4B).
Out of the 50 sex-specific genes, 39 genes showed .1.5-fold
differential expression and 18 genes showed .2-fold differential
expression between sexes (Figure 2A). The small number of sex
biased genes with higher fold changes might be due to the greater
sample heterogeneity. We found 9 (24–37% of total) sex-biased
transcripts differentially regulated in both glomeruli and tubuli
(Figure 2B) i.e. regardless of the kidney compartment. These
transcripts were: EHD2, DDX3Y, EIF1AY, CYorf14, ESPL1,
JARID1D, PNPLA4, RPS4Y1, and XIST.

In addition, we also used the SAM analysis (with a very stringent
FDR of 0%) to define gene expression differences between healthy
male and female kidneys. Firstly, 5 transcripts were identified to be
differentially expressed in glomeruli between male and females
and they all showed more than 2 fold change (Table S9 A).
Secondly, 8 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in
tubuli between male and females (Table S9 B). We found 4
transcripts that were commonly differentially expressed in both
glomeruli and tubuli, these transcripts were XIST, JARID1D,
RPS4Y1 and DDX3Y.
In order to investigate whether there is a sex-specific renal
injury response in the human kidney regardless of the type of the
renal disease, we compared gene expression differences between
diseased male and female tubuli, reasoning, that while the
glomerular morphology shows significant differences in various
glomerular diseases, to our current knowledge one cannot
distinguish tubulointerstitial fibrosis based on the primary disease.
We found 24 transcripts differentially expressed in the tubuloin￾terstitial compartments (Student t-test, p,0.01) when male
samples were compared to female samples under disease condition
(Figure 2A, Table S5). Nine genes; XIST, DDX3Y, JARID1D,
CYorf14, EIF1AY, HDHD1A, RPS4Y1, STS, and ZRSR2
showed differential expression both in healthy and diseased
human kidneys (Figure 2C). The lack of significant overlap
between the baseline and disease related gene expression might
indicate that there are not only baseline differences but a sexually
dimorphic response during disease.
When the SAM analysis (with a very stringent FDR of 0%) was
used, we found 8 differentially expressed transcripts in tubuloin￾terstitial fraction between male and female under disease condition
(Table S10). We identified 6 common sex-biased transcripts when
comparing sex-biased transcripts in tubulointerstitial compartment
under baseline and disease condition, these are XIST, ZRSR2,
CYorf14, JARID1D, DDX3Y and RPS4Y1.
An important limitation of our studies is the use of human
biopsies from a heterogenous population with heterogenous kidney
disease. A significant confounder might also be related to different
sex hormone levels in pre and post-menopausal women. To
address this issue we compared gene expression changes in women
less than 49 years of age (4263, n = 4) to those 50 and above
(6769, n = 4). We found 36 differentially expressed transcripts in
the glomeruli and 361 transcripts that were differentially expressed

in the tubulointerstitium (Table S6). This analysis showed
significant difference in estrogen receptor 1 and 2 expressions
when samples from participants under 49 were compared to those
over 50, indicating the role of sex hormones. However, (given the
cross sectional design) we can not assess whether the regulation of
these genes correlates with hormonal status (pre vs. post￾menopausal status) or by aging.
To further dissect the role of sex hormones we also made
comparisons between healthy male and female glomerular and
tubular samples obtained from participants ,49 years of age. We
found 35 differentially expressed genes when healthy male
glomeruli were compared to female glomeruli. Interestingly 4 of
the 35 genes (GNAS, ID2, TJAP1, COL4A6) had androgen
receptor binding sites on their promoter. Similar analysis
performed on tubular samples of participants ,49 years of age
identified 93 differentially expressed genes (however there were
only 2 samples in each subgroup).
The species-specificity of sexually dimorphic genes
Next we examined the concordance of human and murine
gender biased genes in the kidney. The tubulointerstitium
constitutes the majority (.95%) of the kidney, therefore we
compared gene expression levels in whole kidney lysates of mice to
transcript levels of the tubulointerstitial fraction of human kidneys.
When we compared 67 sex-biased genes in ‘‘healthy’’ human
kidneys with 1162 sexually dimorphic genes in the murine kidney
(Figure 3A), we identified 9 transcripts that were differentially
regulated in both species (corresponding to 13% of all human
gender biased genes and 0.8% of all murine gender biased genes).
These genes were: ALDH9A1, ARL3, DDX3Y, DPP4, JAR￾ID1D, PDZRN3, SEMA5A, WWOX and XIST.
We also compared the sexually dimorphic genes in murine and
human diseased kidneys. This analysis again identified a handful of
commonly regulated genes; DDX3Y, GATA2, SLC16A7, UTX
and XIST transcripts were differentially regulated in both human
and murine diseased kidneys (Figure 3B). Therefore our results
indicate significant species-specific differences in gender biased
gene expression levels in the kidney.
Functional categories of sexually dimorphic genes
In order to understand the function of the sexually dimorphic
genes in the kidney we used the David 2.0 web-based software
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) to find significantly enriched func￾tional groups. To avoid the functional redundancy we used the
level5 gene ontology (GO) annotation. For the biological process
group we identified 5 functional groups (2 in glomeruli and 3 in
tubuli) with statistically significant enrichment in healthy human
kidney (Table 2 and Table S7). These groups included translation,
translation initiation, protein-RNA complex assembly and angio￾genesis. Sexually dimorphic genes in the human kidney were more
likely to encode cytosolic proteins (Table 2 and Table S7).
Functional annotation analysis of murine sexually dimorphic
genes identified 58 and 39 GO terms in the biological process
group with statistically significant enrichment in control and
diseased kidneys, respectively. The top GO terms in the healthy
kidney included steroid and fatty acid synthesis, lipid (glycolipid,
and sphingolipid) metabolism, actin polymerization and vascular
developmental pathways (Table 3 and Table S7). Dimorphic genes
in diseased animals belonged not only to the lipid (phospholipid)
biosynthesis, but to intracellular (vesicle mediated) transport
process as well (Table S7).
Species-specific chromosomal enrichment
Mammalian sex chromosomes are enriched for sexually
dimorphic genes, which are involved in sex development and
differentiation [25,26]. Thus, in the present study we analyzed the
chromosomal localization of renal sexually dimorphic genes by
using GeneTrail Software (http://genetrail.bioinf.uni-sb.de [27]).
This Software compares the proportion of genes in a geneset
located on a specific chromosome to the general chromosomal
distribution of all the genes. The list of genes differentially
regulated in control and diseased human kidneys only showed
significant enrichment for X and Y chromosomes (Table 4), while
the differentially expressed genes in the mouse kidney showed
enrichment not only for sex chromosomes but for various
autosomes (including chromosome 4, 7, 14, 19) (Table 4).
Interestingly previous studies already indicated male biased gene
enrichment in the liver on chromosome 19 [21]. Thus, our results
indicate a conserved enrichment for sex chromosomes and species￾specific chromosomal enrichment to autosomes.
Enrichment of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in
response to disease
In order to understand the regulation of sexually dimorphic
genes in human and mouse kidneys, we examined transcription
factor binding sites (TFBS) on the sex biased transcripts. With the
use of the oPOSSUM program [28], which contains around 100
verified transcription binding sites in its database, we searched for
regulatory elements within 5 kb upstream regions of the sexually
dimorphic genes, which could be indicative of transcription factor
binding.
In healthy human kidney tubules, sex-biased genes showed
significant enrichment for several TF, including: ELK4, Broad￾complex_1 & 3, CF2-II, RORA1, NR2F1 and CF2-II transcrip￾tion factor-binding sites (Table 5). The promoter region of the
murine sexually dimorphic genes showed enrichment for 7
different TF under baseline condition (Table 6 and Table S8).
Based on the known effects of sex steroids, we were specifically
interested in finding binding sites for estrogen or androgen
receptors and transcription factors regulated by sex hormones.
Analysis with the oPOSSUM program indicated no statistically
significant enrichment for sex steroid hormone receptor binding
sites on the promoter of the sexually dimorphic genes.
We also compared TFBS of sex-biased genes: in healthy kidneys
there was a common enrichment for Broad-complex_3 binding
sites, while in diseased kidneys, there was enrichment for
transcription factors Broad-complex_1. Thus our results suggest

Discussion
Understanding sex related differences in renal disease develop￾ment is a critical but understudied issue. The incidence of ESRD is
50% higher in males, which makes gender one of the most
significant risk determinants for the development of kidney disease.
The cause and mechanism of sex bias in renal disease development
is largely unknown. This study was aimed to determine global gene
expression differences in male and female kidneys of humans and
mice in order to better understand gender differences.
According to our knowledge this is the first study to describe
gender related global gene expression differences in human kidney
samples. In the present study we used 42 human kidney samples
and identified 67 (26 in glomeruli and 50 in tubules) transcripts
differentially expressed in ‘‘healthy’’ human kidneys. We not only
analyzed control kidneys but also found 24 differentially expressed
transcripts when diseased male and female tubulointerstitial
samples were compared. We think that the relatively small
number of differentially expressed genes with higher fold changes
may be related to the high degree of sample heterogeneity
(including race and type of renal disease).
Our study shows that the most consistently identified gender
biased genes (found both in human and mice, control and diseased
kidneys) are those that localized on sex chromosomes (X, Y).
These genes largely, but not fully overlap with genes that have
been described in other organs. Tissue specific expression of sex
chromosome genes has been observed in somatic tissues, but their
role is largely unknown [25,26,29,30]. During development, Y￾chromosome related genes are involved in male specification. The
differential expression of X, Y-chromosome genes might also be
required to restore balanced expression of X-linked genes between
the sexes. However, this general mechanism cannot explain the
tissue specific expression of some of the sex chromosome genes.
Therefore we might speculate that this tissue specific expression
could be important for gender differences that can be observed in
certain disease conditions but not in others.
The role of many of the genes located on the sex chromosomes
is unknown. However, we would like to highlight a recent paper by
Tan et al. [31]. In this study, the authors determined that
antibodies against RPS4Y1 and DDX3Y were associated with
increased rate of acute rejection when a male kidney was
transplanted into a female recipient. RPS4Y1 and DDX3Y were
some of the top genes that we identified as differentially expressed
when we compared male and female kidneys, indicating that sex
chromosomal genes might have important clinical significance.
Further mechanistic studies are needed to examine this concept.
A surprising and important finding of our studies is the narrow
concordance between gender biased genes in mice and humans
(both at baseline and under disease conditions). This degree of
overlap might not be statistically different from random variations.
Given that many of the gender biased genes were sex chromosome
related and there is an almost 10-fold difference in the number of
known transcripts in the human and murine sex chromosomes,
this might not be unexpected. Our results strongly reinforce the
concept that caution needs to be exercised when we use rodent
models to study gender related differences.
Interestingly, there was no clear enrichment for sex steroid
hormone receptor binding sites on the promoter of the gender-biased
genes either in human or in murine kidneys. While one can argue that
some of the human samples were from post-menopausal women, it is
important to note that the same observation was true for the murine
samples as well. The absence of clear enrichment for sex-hormone
regulated genes is consistent with the results 2 previous gene
expression studies performed on mice [19,21]. This could indicate
that genes are regulated in a more complex regulatory network,
rather than direct sex steroid hormone binding. Genomic and
nongenomic actions of sex steroid hormones might converge on the
regulation of target genes via signal transduction pathways that

modulate the activity of several transcription factors. In addition,
ovarian steroids are released in a cyclic fashion, thus their target genes
might also be expressed in a cyclic fashion, making it increasingly
difficult to identify them. Gene expression studies aiming to reveal
cycle-dependent changes are in their infancy. Sex hormones are the
main focus of research to decipher the mechanism of sex differences,
but increasing amount of evidence suggest that gender differences can
also be mediated by growth hormone, which has a different secretion
pattern in men and women [32,33,34].
Our study is one of the first that analyzed gender related global
gene expression changes in renal injury models. We determined that
while there were baseline gender specific gene expression differences
in the kidney, different genes were differentially expressed in
diseased kidneys. This observation might have very important
consequences for clinical medicine and could imply that different
treatment strategies need to be applied for men and women with
renal disease. These results are consistent with findings obtained in
the cardiovascular field, where gender specific differences have been
reported for disease development and treatment response. Unfor￾tunately, there were a few inherent limitations of our study. First, we
could not distinguish whether the severity of renal disease resulted
from systemic differences (including drug metabolism) or from gene
expression response differences inherent to the kidney. In addition,
the cross-sectional design of our study did not allow us establish
causality. Our analysis also included multiple comparisons, which
increases the probability of false discoveries. We were cognizant of
this issue; however, as this was one of the first studies that explored
sexually dimorphic gene expression changes in human and murine
kidneys we opted to maximize the sensitivity at the expense of
specificity. Further large scale expression and mechanistic studies
will be necessary to confirm our finding and to establish causality.
In summary, here we provide a first description of sex specific
gene expression differences in human and murine kidneys under
baseline and disease conditions. Our studies highlight significant
differences in human and murine kidneys both at baseline and in
their response to injury. We identified several new candidate
transcripts that could enable us to better understand sex specific
differences in the occurrence and pharmacologic responses of
kidney injury in humans. Our studies suggest a need to further
investigate sex specific treatments for kidney disease.
Materials and Methods
The clinical study used the cross-sectional design. Kidney
samples were obtained at the Montefiore Medical Center (MMC)
of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM) from living
allograft donor and surgical nephrectomies and from left-over
portions of diagnostic kidney biopsies. The study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the AECOM and MMC (2002-
202 to K.S.). Written consent was obtained from all living kidney
donors and recipients. Clinical information was collected using
standardized datasheets.
Tissue handling
Kidney tissue was obtained in the operating room immediately
after removal from the patient. Tissue was placed into RNALater
right after removal from the body and was kept at 4uC. Part of the
sample was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. 4 mm
sections were cut and stained with PAS and were evaluated and
graded by an expert nephropathologist.
Microdissection
1 mm61 mm biopsy tissues were placed under Olympus model
SZX12 stereomicroscope using 906magnification. The biopsy
tissue was manually microdissected at 4uC in RNALater for
glomerular and tubular compartment using fine tip forceps. In
general, 5 glomeruli that readily released from the capsule were
collected and placed into cold RLT solution (Qiagen RNeasy kit).
The corresponding tubulointerstitial and vascular compartment was
placed into RLT solution also. For easier designation we called this
component tubules throughout the manuscript. Dissected tissue was
homogenized using Powergen125 (Fisher) homogenizer and stored
at 280uC. RNA was prepared using RNAeasy mini columns
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
RNA quality and quantity was determined using Lab-on-Chip
Total RNA PicoKit, Agilent BioAnalyzer. Only samples without
evidence of degradation were further used.
Animal Experiments were conducted in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine. We made all efforts to minimize
the number of animals used and their suffering.Renal disease was
induced in about 10-week old male and female Balb/c mice via
intravenous injection of 12 mg/kg doxorubicin. Urine was collected
in metabolic cages for 24 hrs and albuminuria was measured using
mouse albumin specific ELISA (Bethyl Laboratories), and corrected
to urinary creatinine excretion, by using picric acid method.
Microarray Procedure was compliant with MIAME. For
the human kidney tissue (glomeruli or tubuli), purified total RNAs
were amplified using the Two-Cycle Target Labeling Kit
(Affymetrix) as per manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, total RNA
(10 ng) from each sample was first reverse transcribed into cDNA
using a T7 promoter-dT primer [59GGCCAGTGAATTGTAA￾TACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(T)24], then converted
to double-stranded cDNA and amplified with an in vitro
transcription reaction using T7 RNA polymerase. The products
were then reverse transcribed into cDNA again, using random
hexamer primers. A final in vitro transcription reaction was
performed using the GeneChip IVT labeling kit (Affymetrix, USA)
to produce biotinylated cRNA for microarray.
Mouse tissue total RNA was prepared from whole kidneys using
TrizolH (Invitrogen). Gene expression studies were performed
using the Affymetrix One Cycle labeling kit as per manufacturer’s
instruction.
For the analysis of gene expression data after hybridization and
scanning, raw data files were imported into Array Assist Software
(Invitrogen, USA). Database and expression levels were normal￾ized using the GCRMA algorithm. This normalization method is a
mathematical technique used to reduce discrepancies in hybrid￾ization patterns that might result from variables in target
amplification, hybridization conditions, staining or probe array
lot. Normalizations standardize the data to facilitate identification
of genuine gene expression difference. For statistical analysis, the
data was exported into Excel (Microsoft) and Statistical Analysis of
Microarray Software and Student’s t-test were used. Gene
expression data is uploaded to NICBI gene expression omnibus
(GEO numbers; GSE12682, GSE12683).
Histology was evaluated in formalin fixed paraffin embedded
kidney tissues, which were stained using the PAS protocol.
Gene Ontology Classification and Overrepresentation of
Biological Themes
All significant gene entries were subjected to GO classification.
Significant overrepresentation of GO-classified biological process￾es was determined by comparing the number of genes in the
biological process that were significantly differentially expressed in
a particular mouse strain to the total number of genes relevant to
that biological process printed on the array using the publicly

The significance was determined by modified Fisher’s exact test
(EASE Score, p,0.05).
Analysis of overrepresented chromosomes was per￾formed using GeneTrail Software [27] (http://genetrail.bioinf.

(p,0.05).
Analysis of enrichment for TFBS was performed by using
the oPOSSUM Sotware [28] (http://burgundy.cmmt.ubc.ca/
oPOSSUM/). For each transcript, the top 10% of conserved
regions in the 5000 bp up or down-stream sequences with
minimum conservation of 70% and matrix match threshold of
80% were scanned for TFBS and the significance level was
determined by Fisher’s exact test score at p,0.05.
