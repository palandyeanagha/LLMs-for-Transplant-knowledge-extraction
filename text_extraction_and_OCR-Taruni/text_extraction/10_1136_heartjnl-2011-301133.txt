CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
Management of the failing Fontan
circulation
Barbara J Deal,1 Marshall L Jacobs2
The ‘Fontan circulation’ has evolved to include
a variety of surgical procedures designed to over￾come the absence of two distinct ventricular
chambers.1 w1ew3 Inherent to this circulation is
chronic elevation of right atrial and vena caval
pressure, and absence of a dedicated power source
to serve the pulmonary circulation, making low
pulmonary vascular resistance and optimal
systemic ventricular function the essential ingredi￾ents of a successful Fontan circulation.2 Originally
designed for the single left ventricle, modifications
to the original atriopulmonary connections
extended repairs to complex ventricular anatomy,
and are now most commonly performed for single
right ventricular anatomy associated with hypo￾plastic left heart syndrome. Together with
improved perioperative management, creation of
the Fontan circulation in two stages (superior
cavopulmonary anastomosis followed by later
Fontan completionw4), and performance of Fontan
procedures at a younger age, have led to reduced
operative mortality associated with the Fontan
procedure of #5% (compared with 15e30% in
earlier decades); survival at 20 years is presently
85%.3 w5
Over the last two decades, the initial survivors of
the atriopulmonary Fontan repairs have reached
adulthood, bringing a multiplicity of haemodynamic
complications and sequelae of their abnormal circu￾latory status. The atriopulmonary connection is
now obsolete as a surgical option, and the current
surviving adults with this circulation do not reflect
contemporary Fontan outcomes. Nonetheless, their
attendant compendium of complications and
sequelae provides a daunting array of management
challenges, and stigmatises the current perception of
long term Fontan outcomes.
The ‘Fontan circulation’ now encompasses
a spectrum of anatomic substrates, staging options,
and operative techniques. Problems classified as
‘Fontan failure’ may represent problems inherent to
the morphologic substrate, operative variables, and
inevitable sequelae of the Fontan circulation:
chronic venous congestion and progressively
declining functional status. This review will sepa￾rate complications into those where intervention
may optimise clinical status while maintaining the
Fontan circulationdthe ‘failing Fontan’dand those
conditions which have progressed to a ‘failed
Fontan’, where options are limited to cardiac
transplantation or attempts to minimise the
impact of irreversible functional deterioration.
Finally, we will discuss strategies which may alter
the incidence and time course of Fontan failure.
THE FAILING FONTAN CIRCULATION
Evaluation of the failing or failed Fontan circulation
requires knowledge of the anatomic substrate,
surgical intervention details, cardiac imaging and
assessment of haemodynamic status, assessment of
rhythm status, and evaluation of other organ
systems and metabolic function. Late Fontan
failure may present insidiously over years. It is
a failure of medical management to interpret the
absence of overt symptoms or ascites as evidence of
optimal haemodynamic status in the functionally
univentricular circulation. In contrast to other
forms of operated congenital heart disease, Fontan
patients have lived with less than ideal cardiac
output their entire lives, and may neither recognise
nor show overt manifestations of progressive
decline in functional status until deterioration is
quite advanced (table 1).
Growth
In general, the Fontan patient population is shorter
in height than the normal population; there is
increased recognition that failure to gain weight
appropriately is an early indicator of suboptimal
cardiac output in childhood.4 Growth failure should
prompt a thorough investigation of haemodynamic
status, with early efforts to optimise haemodynamic
status with catheter or surgical intervention for
residual obstruction or valve abnormalities.
Exercise capacity is lower in Fontan patients
than in other patients with repaired congenital
heart disease, and recent studies have reported
a 1e3% annual decline in maximal oxygen
consumption beginning in adolescence.5 w6ew8 In
Fontan patients, the average peak oxygen
consumption ranges from 19e28 ml/kg/min, or
50e60% of predicted consumption for age. Decline
in exercise function correlates with the need for
hospitalisation and symptom development.6 w8
Decreased exercise tolerance is more common in
single right or indeterminant ventricular
morphology, and in patients with lateral tunnel
repairs, and may be related to chronotropic
incompetence or abnormal pulmonary compliance
with exertion.6 w8 w9 Serial exercise testing may
objectively identify changes in haemodynamic or
rhythm status, which may be addressed with
intervention such as pulmonary stenting, atrial

pacing, pulmonary vasodilator therapy, or Fontan
conversion surgery.5
Cyanosis
A mild degree of desaturation is present in most
Fontan patients, due to coronary sinus drainage to
the left atrium or pulmonary shunting. Resting
saturations <90% suggest the presence of right to
left shunting (either intracardiac or due to veno￾veno collateral flow to the left atrium) or pulmo￾nary arteriovenous fistulae. Coil embolisation of
collaterals or catheter based occlusion of atrial
septal defects may improve saturations, although
investigation for a more compelling cause for the
development of collaterals may allow more defini￾tive intervention. Patients with discontinuous
pulmonary arteries with a classic Glenn to the right
pulmonary artery have insufficient hepatic flow to
that lung, and would benefit from surgical inter￾vention to provide confluent pulmonary arteries
and increased hepatic flow to the right lung.
Patients with atriopulmonary connections
frequently have ‘decompressing’ collateral flow or
atrial level shunts, and benefit from Fontan
conversion.
Pathway obstructions and valve dysfunction
The development of haemodynamic abnormalities
may be gradual and insidious in Fontan patients,
and detection is complicated by the lack of
complaints from most patients until pronounced
limitation occurs. Decline in exercise tolerance,
resting or exercise desaturation, the presence of
a murmur, hepatomegaly, or cardiomegaly on
radiography are indicators of haemodynamic
abnormalities. Patients with atriopulmonary
connections develop marked right atrial distension
over time, secondary to anatomic obstructions at
the anastomosis, or due to the notable energy loss
associated with sluggish flow (figure 1). Decom￾pression of the atrium occurs via coronary sinus
dilatation, and atrial communications or veno-veno
collaterals from the systemic veins to the left
atrium or pulmonary veins may ensue. Distension
of the right atrium may result in torsion and
narrowing of the connection to the pulmonary
arteries, as well as compression of the pulmonary
venous return from the right lung; the dilated
atrium may impinge on inflow in the setting of
a right-sided atrioventricular valve. Anatomic
obstructions may exist at the atriopulmonary
anastomosis or the branch pulmonary arteries;
a gradient of >1 mm Hg in this circuit dependent
on passive flow is haemodynamically significant.
Patients with valved conduits in place, either
atrioventricular or atriopulmonary, invariably
develop obstruction over time. Patients with lateral
tunnel repairs in general do not develop pronounced
atrial distension, but narrowing at the pulmonary
arteries may exist. Abnormalities of atrioventricular
(AV) valve function result in elevated left atrial
pressure, which will harm the pulmonary circula￾tion. Chronic aortic outflow obstruction will result
in hypertrophy and diminished ventricular
compliance; the volume overload of aortic insuffi￾ciency will contribute to ventricular failure.

Hepatic and infra-diaphragmatic venous conges￾tion is present in all Fontan patients, to greater or
lesser degrees. Sequestration of platelets by the liver
and spleen result in thrombocytopenia, present in
15e25% of adult Fontan patients. Mild elevation of
bilirubin is common, followed by abnormalities of
liver enzymes. The effects of years of venous
congestion will result in hepatic cirrhosis, which
becomes apparent by approximately 11 years
following surgery.7 Surveillance with abdominal
ultrasound may detect hepatic nodules, with more
detailed imaging provided by CT. Monitoring of a￾fetoprotein may provide early detection of hepato￾cellular carcinoma, now reported in a small number
of older Fontan patients.
Arrhythmias
This broad term includes sinus node dysfunction,
predominant junctional rhythm, atrioventricular
block, supraventricular and ventricular arrhyth￾mias, and the risk of arrhythmic sudden death.
Modifications to the Fontan procedure have
resulted in a decreased incidence of sinus node
dysfunction and atrial arrhythmias. Sinus node
dysfunction is reported in 40% of patients with
atriopulmonary connections, and is reported in
up to 25% of lateral tunnel and extracardiac cavo￾pulmonary connection surgeries.8 9 w10 w11
Reassurance based on an ‘adequate overall heart
rate’, which is usually junctional, is a disservice to
the patient, as the haemodynamic consequences of
junctional rhythm in the Fontan circulation are
profound, including acute elevation of atrial pres￾sure with each ventricular contraction. Non-sinus
rhythm has been associated with increased risk of
atrial arrhythmias, as well as an increased risk of
hepatic fibrosisw12; these data warrant vigorous
attempts to maintain regular atrial rhythm in
Fontan patients.
The incidence of atrial arrhythmias during long
term follow-up has decreased with surgical modi￾fications of the Fontan procedure, from as many as
60% of atriopulmonary patients to approximately
12% of extracardiac total cavopulmonary connec￾tion patients.9e13 w5 w13 Atrial reentrant tachy￾cardia accounts for approximately 75% of
supraventricular tachycardia, with focal atrial
tachycardia in up to 15% of patients.w13 w14 In
lateral tunnel patients, the reentrant circuit may
reside in the pulmonary venous atrium. Atrial
fibrillation is becoming increasingly common in
adult Fontan patients, and is present in almost half
of patients referred for Fontan conversion. Risk
factors for the development of atrial tachycardia
include an atriopulmonary connection, preopera￾tive bradycardia, lack of sinus rhythm, older age at
Fontan and longer postoperative interval, greater
than mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and
heterotaxy syndrome.3 9 11 w11 As the incidence of
atrial tachycardia increases with the postoperative
interval and is a major source of morbidity,8 10
regular surveillance of rhythm with ambulatory
24 h monitors, event monitors and exercise testing
becomes more important during long term follow￾up.
Termination of an acute episode of atrial tachy￾cardia within 24e48 h from onset is recommended
whenever possible, due to the rapid deterioration in
haemodynamic status associated with tachycardia
in the single ventricle circulation. Figure 2
summarises an algorithm for management of atrial
arrhythmias.w15 Development of atrial tachycardia
is commonly associated with haemodynamic
abnormalities which will require more extensive
haemodynamic, functional, and metabolic evalua￾tion. Catheter ablation for atrial tachycardia in
Fontan patients has considerably lower success
rates than in other forms of repaired congenital
heart disease. Acute success rates from catheter
ablation in the Fontan patient range from 40e75%,
with recurrence of tachycardia in 60% of patients
during the first year.14 w14 Catheter ablation in this

population is best suited for patients with lateral
tunnel repairs and focal atrial tachycardia, or
atriopulmonary repairs who are not suitable
candidates for Fontan arrhythmia surgery. The
development of significant arrhythmias in the
atriopulmonary or atrioventricular Fontan modifi￾cation, when coupled with signs of heart failure, is
associated with a 3 year mortality rate of 25%.6
Fontan conversion with arrhythmia surgery
Recognition that atriopulmonary Fontan patients
have associated haemodynamic limitations in
addition to atrial tachycardia led our group to
incorporate arrhythmia surgery into Fontan
conversion to an extracardiac total cavopulmonary
connection, beginning in 1994.15 w16 In addition to
right atrial reduction, performance of a modified
right atrial maze procedure eliminates right atrial
macro-reentrant tachycardia, but is not intended to
treat focal atrial tachycardia or other mechanisms
without targeted resection (figure 3). Left atrial
macro-reentrant tachycardia or atrial fibrillation is
treated with an additional left atrial Cox Maze III,
which effectively eliminates atrial fibrillation, but
we have noted recurrence of a slower organised
atrial reentry tachycardia in about 15% of such
patients.w16 Implantation of epicardial dual
chamber anti-tachycardia pacing systems is
performed for virtually all patients, predominantly
relying on atrial pacing at rates of 70e80 beats/min
chronically, without ventricular pacing. Our centre
has performed over 135 Fontan conversions with
arrhythmia surgery at a mean interval of
15.565.2 years following initial Fontan procedure,
with acute mortality of 1.5%; other centres have
achieved relatively comparable results.16 Analysis of
intermediate outcomes in the initial 110 patients
undergoing such surgery at our centre showed
freedom from death or transplantation at 15 years
of follow-up was 80%, with freedom from recur￾rent tachycardia of 85%. Risk factors for poor
outcomes in this population include right or
ambiguous ventricle, presence of right atrial
thrombus at time of surgery, older age at Fontan
conversion, longer post-Fontan interval, or ascites.
Patients with protein-losing enteropathy are not
considered candidates for Fontan conversion
surgery, and patients without correctable causes of
poor ventricular function, or multiorgan system
disease, may be better treated by transplantation.
We have recently demonstrated improved func￾tional status at 5 years of follow-up in a subset of
patients undergoing paired pre- and post-Fontan
conversion exercise testing, with an average 17%
increase in maximal oxygen consumption. These
results suggest that aggressive efforts to improve
flow dynamics and associated haemodynamic
abnormalities, eliminate arrhythmias, and maintain
chronic atrial rhythm may favourably alter what
has been considered as an ‘inexorable decline’ in
functional status in many Fontan patients.
In addition to atrial arrhythmias, atrioventricular
block occurs, either due to intrinsic conduction
abnormalities as seen in patients with L-trans￾position, or as a consequence of surgery. The inci￾dence of pacemaker implantation in most series
ranges from 3e18%, without stratification as to
implantation for AV block versus sinus node
dysfunction.3 w5 w17 Limitations of venous access
to the atrium, the risk of endocardial lead throm￾bosis, and the morbidity of repeat sternotomy to
place epicardial leads, support a preemptive
strategy of atrial lead placement at the time of
primary Fontan repair, although not a class I or II
indication for pacing by current recommendations.
With improved survival, it is becoming apparent
that ventricular arrhythmias are noted in 3e12% of
adult patients.17 w5 w17 The contribution of
ventricular arrhythmias to late sudden death,
reported in 9% of patients, is not yet known.18
Ascites
Ascites may develop as a consequence of elevated
right atrial pressure, protein-losing enteropathy or
hepatic dysfunction, and requires clarification of
the aetiology with aggressive evaluation and treat￾ment. Ascites may occur without hypo￾albuminaemia, but is an advanced indicator of
a failing Fontan circulation; in this setting, Fontan
conversion with arrhythmia surgery may be
feasible, although with increased risk of later

Fontan failure. A small number of patients have
persistent or recurrent ascites late after Fontan
conversion, without evidence of Fontan circulation
obstruction. In this setting, ascites is thought to be
related to hepatic dysfunction. Diuretic therapy
and optimisation of medical therapy may minimise
ascites; regular evaluation of cirrhotic changes with
abdominal ultrasound, CT or MRI, and monitoring
of liver function, is recommended. When advanced
cardiac liver cirrhosis changes are noted, the risk for
hepatocellular carcinoma increases.7 Combined
cardiac and liver transplantation for a Fontan
patient has been performed successfully.w18
THE FAILED FONTAN
In the unusual setting of early postoperative failure,
a failed circulation requires early takedown of the
Fontan surgical circuit. Late failure, discussed here,
includes haemodynamic or multiorgan system
complications of the Fontan circulation which are
not reversible by surgical or catheter interventions
at acceptable risk. Strategies to minimise/palliate
complications or consideration for cardiac trans￾plantation are the limited therapeutic options. Table
2 summarises the conditions associated with a failed
Fontan, which are discussed in several excellent
reviews.19 w19 Most studies report early operative
mortality for Fontan patients undergoing cardiac
transplantation at approximately 30%, higher than
that reported for other forms of congenital heart
disease,20 although one recent study showed no
difference in early mortality among Fontan
patients.w20 Problems specific to the Fontan patient
undergoing transplantation include multiple prior
surgeries with increased sensitisation rates between
20e60%, with preformed antibodies to donor
human leucocyte antigens (HLA), complexities of
venous anatomy, malnourishment associated with
protein-losing enteropathy, and acute graft right
heart failure. After the early transplant period, there
is no difference in long term survival compared with
other forms of congenital heart disease, with
survival rates at 10 years of around 54%.w21 w22 Due
to the significant mortality on the waiting list and
elevated early mortality, there is interest in devel￾oping implantable mechanical assist devices in
Fontan patients as either a bridge to trans￾plantation, or ‘destination therapy’.
w23 w24
FAILURE OF MEDICAL CARE
At this stage in our knowledge of the natural history
of the Fontan circulation, several concepts have
become clear, including: (1) the unique challenges of
the functionally univentricular circulation with
progressive multiorgan system impact; (2) the
inability to definitively treat a truly ‘failed’ Fontan
with measures other than cardiac transplantation;
(3) the inadequacy of traditional cardiac follow-up
visits to reliably detect subtle changes in circulation
before advanced stages; and (4) the challenges in
‘cardiac’ management that present unlike any other
repaired congenital cardiac anomalies. In addition,

the collective memory of the earlier high mortality or
prolonged hospital courses associated with primary
Fontan surgery in past decades has made many
clinicians reluctant to recommend additional inter￾ventions, particularly without overt symptoms.
In addition to standard haemodynamic evalua￾tions, more global assessment of the impact of the
Fontan physiology on other organ systems needs to
become part of routine surveillance (table 2). It
cannot be assumed that the patient has other
healthcare providers with adequate knowledge of
the impact of the Fontan circulation to monitor
these systems. Growth failure in childhood and
weight loss in adulthood are advanced manifesta￾tions of inadequate haemodynamic status. In
adulthood, exercise intolerance may result in
extremes of a sedentary lifestyle and result in obe￾sity. By contributing to alterations in pulmonary
functionw22 and increased systemic vascular resis￾tance, overweight contributes rapidly to Fontan
failure. Patients should be counselled on the
importance of regular aerobic activity for condi￾tioning, and avoidance of overweight as essential to
limiting Fontan failure.
In the USA, the cardiologist caring for Fontan
patients is now asked to routinely monitor and
assess other organ systems, including haematologic,
endocrine, pulmonary, hepatic and gastrointestinal,
within the confines of decreased reimbursement for
testing and shorter office visits. The barriers to
sophisticated medical care for the older Fontan
patient encompass difficulties in education of the
patient relative to the need for regular cardiac care,
availability of comprehensive integrated care
centres with sufficient expertise, and in many
countries the lack of healthcare coverage. None￾theless, it is apparent that a change in practice for
the routine long term follow-up of Fontan patients
is necessary in order to detect progressive subtle
decline in status and to have a favourable impact on
the functional status of these unique survivors
(table 3). Failure to change our standard methods of
routine cardiac care in this setting constitutes
a failure of optimal medical management. Chronic
pulmonary vasodilator therapy, in addition to
chronic diuresis, may become part of routine long
term medical therapy as this population ages.w25
