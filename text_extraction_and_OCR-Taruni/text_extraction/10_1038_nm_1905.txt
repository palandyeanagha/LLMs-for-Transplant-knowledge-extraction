Sepsis causes over 200,000 deaths yearly in the US; better treatments are urgently needed. Administering bone marrow
stromal cells (BMSCs—also known as mesenchymal stem cells) to mice before or shortly after inducing sepsis by cecal
ligation and puncture reduced mortality and improved organ function. The beneficial effect of BMSCs was eliminated by
macrophage depletion or pretreatment with antibodies specific for interleukin-10 (IL-10) or IL-10 receptor. Monocytes
and/or macrophages from septic lungs made more IL-10 when prepared from mice treated with BMSCs versus untreated mice.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages produced more IL-10 when cultured with BMSCs, but this effect was
eliminated if the BMSCs lacked the genes encoding Toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation primary response gene-88, tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1a or cyclooxygenase-2. Our results suggest that BMSCs (activated by LPS or TNF-a) reprogram
macrophages by releasing prostaglandin E2 that acts on the macrophages through the prostaglandin EP2 and EP4 receptors.
Because BMSCs have been successfully given to humans and can easily be cultured and might be used without human
leukocyte antigen matching, we suggest that cultured, banked human BMSCs may be effective in treating sepsis in high-risk
patient groups.
Sepsis, a serious medical condition that affects 18 million people per
year worldwide, is characterized by a generalized inflammatory state
caused by infection. Widespread activation of inflammation and
coagulation pathways progresses to multiple organ dysfunction,
collapse of the circulatory system (septic shock) and death. Because
as many people die of sepsis annually as from acute myocardial
infarction1, a new treatment regimen is desperately needed. In the
last few years, it has been discovered that BMSCs are potent mod￾ulators of immune responses2–5. We wondered whether such cells
could bring the immune response back into balance, thus attenuating
the underlying pathophysiology that eventually leads to severe sepsis,
septic shock and death6,7.
As a model of sepsis, we chose cecal ligation and puncture (CLP),
a procedure that has been used for more than two decades8.
This mouse model closely resembles the human disease: it has a
focal origin (cecum), is caused by multiple intestinal organisms,
and results in septicemia with release of bacterial toxins into the
circulation. With no treatment, the majority of the mice die
24–48 h postoperatively.
RESULTS
BMSC treatment improves survival and organ function after CLP
First, we looked at survival rates after CLP in untreated and BMSC￾treated mice. There was a statistically significant (P o 0.01) improve￾ment in the survival of mice given 1 million BMSCs intravenously at
the time of surgery; 50% of the mice survived until the end of day 4,
when all were killed (Fig. 1a). The beneficial effect on survival was
seen when the cells were injected 24 h before or 1 h after CLP
(Fig. 1a). In contrast, intravenous injection of isolated skin fibroblasts,
whole bone marrow or heat-killed BMSCs did not alter survival
(Fig. 1a). BMSCs isolated from different strains of mice (C57/BL6,
BALB/c or FVB/NJ) all rescued the C57/BL6 mice that we used in our
studies (Fig. 1a).
Because the lethality in sepsis is associated with organ failure, we
examined the pathology and function of major organs often injured in
human subjects. Kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine
and renal tubular injury scores, was markedly improved in the treated
mice (Fig. 1b). BMSCs reduced organ damage when they were
administered up to 24 h before CLP surgery (Supplementary Fig. 1

online). In the livers, improved glycogen storage was observed in
treated mice versus control mice (Fig. 1c). Concentrations of liver
enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase)
that are released into the circulation upon injury and death of liver
cells were significantly decreased in the serum after treatment
(Fig. 1d), as were serum amylase values, which mirror pancreatic
damage (Fig. 1e). Similarly, there was a significant decrease in the
number of apoptotic (activated caspase-3–positive) and necrotic cells
in the spleen (Fig. 1f). These results suggest that BMSCs protect
infected mice from death and organ damage.
Effect of BMSCs on plasma cytokine concentrations
We hypothesized that BMSCs might alter the immune response to
infection; therefore, we studied TNF-a and IL-6, proinflammatory
cytokines that have a central role in sepsis1. Twenty-four hours
after injection of BMSCs, there was a signifi￾cant reduction in serum TNF-a and IL-6
concentrations in treated versus untreated
mice (Fig. 1g). Serum concentrations of
interferon-g were unaltered by BMSCs (Sup￾plementary Fig. 2 online), but IL-10 abun￾dance started to rise 3 h after the cells were
given, almost doubled by the sixth hour and
was still elevated 12 h afterward. (Fig. 1h).
To learn where injected BMSCs go and
how long they remain detectable, we pre￾labeled the cells with carboxyfluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE)
fluorescent tracking dye and visualized
them 1–24 h later. We found BMSCs in the
blood up to 1 h after intravenous injections
and saw many cells in the lung parenchyma,
with some in the spleen and kidney. The
labeled cells in the lung seemed to be sur￾rounded by macrophages (Fig. 2a–c). What
attracts these cells to each other remains to
be determined. The number of cells in the
lung gradually decreased over time; few were
visible 24 h after they were administered
(data not shown).
Alterations in vascular permeability are
central to the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced
organ injury, and the benefits of BMSC
treatment in reducing vascular permeability
have already been reported9–12. We studied
this in the peritoneum, lung, liver and kidney
by measuring Evans blue dye leakage 24 h
after CLP. CLP surgery significantly increased
peritoneal, liver and renal vascular perme￾ability (P o 0.01, P o 0.01 and P o 0.001,
respectively); all three were significantly
(P o 0.05, P o 0.05 and P o 0.05, respec￾tively) decreased in mice treated with BMSCs
(Supplementary Fig. 3 online).
Involvement of immune cell subtypes in
the effect of BMSCs
The observations summarized above sug￾gested that BMSCs might quickly act to
reprogram a specific population of cells
involved in mediating the immune response.
To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of BMSCs in mice that
genetically lack mature T and B cells (Rag2–/–)13 or are depleted of
natural killer (NK) cells with a rabbit ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide
(asialo GM1)-specific antibody, resulting in nearly complete elimina￾tion of NK cell activity14,15. The effect of BMSC injections on the
survival of the mice was still present in both of these models,
suggesting that lymphocyte populations of T, B and NK cells do not
mediate the effect of BMSCs in the CLP model (Supplementary Fig. 4
online). Because BMSCs were found in close proximity to lung
macrophages, we asked whether monocytes and/or macrophages are
needed for the beneficial effects of the BMSCs. To deplete monocytes
and macrophages, we administered clodronate-filled liposomes to the
mice16 before we performed the CLP procedure and then treated them
with BMSCs. BMSCs were no longer effective in mice lacking mono￾cytes and macrophages (Fig. 2d).

Macrophage-derived IL-10 is key for the effect of BMSCs
Because IL-10 serum levels were increased in CLP mice that were
treated with BMSCs as compared to sham controls, we asked whether
IL-10 might be important for the actions of BMSCs. To test this
hypothesis, we treated mice with an antibody to IL-10 or an antibody
to the IL-10 receptor before CLP. In both of these groups, the BMSC
injections were ineffective (Fig. 2e), suggesting that IL-10 is a major
mediator of the effect. To see whether the injected BMSCs might be
producing an essential pool of IL-10, we used BMSCs isolated from
Il10–/– mice. These BMSCs were still effective in improving the
survival of mice after CLP (Fig. 2f), suggesting that the source of
the IL-10 is an endogenous population of cells. Large amounts of
IL-10 are known to be produced by subsets of T cells and monocytes
and macrophages17. As mentioned earlier (Fig. 2d), monocyte and
consequent macrophage depletion eliminated the beneficial effect of
BMSCs; thus, we focused on monocytes and macrophages as the
probable source of IL-10 required for survival after CLP. BMSC
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the number of circulat￾ing monocytes and an increase in the number of circulating neutro￾phils (Fig. 3a,b). Because tissue macrophages are derived from
circulating monocytes, we speculated that the decrease in monocyte
numbers might be due to their tissue invasion. We found a significant
increase in the number of lung monocytes and macrophages in CLP
versus unoperated mice by immunocytochemistry (data not shown).
This increase was completely eliminated when circulating monocytes
were depleted with clodronate-filled liposomes (Fig. 3c). To confirm
the histological findings, we used FACS to determine the relative
percentages of immune cells isolated from the lungs of four treated
versus four untreated septic mice. There was an increase in monocytes
but not lymphoid cells in the lung (Fig. 4a,b). Monocytes and
macrophages (CD11b+) were isolated from the lungs of BMSC-treated
and untreated mice18, placed in culture and restimulated with LPS.
Three and five hours after LPS stimulation ex vivo, monocytes and
macrophages from BMSC-treated septic mice produced and released
significantly more IL-10 than did untreated mice (Fig. 4c). To
determine whether the change in IL-10 production was due to direct
interaction between BMSCs and monocytes and macrophages, we
cultured the two cell populations together or placed them in a
transwell system in which two cell populations were separated from
one another by a permeable membrane. In addition, we put mono-

macrophages were in direct contact with BMSCs (Fig. 4d), they
produced significantly (P o 0.001) more IL-10 in response to LPS
stimulation than when they were cultured in transwell plates without
direct contact with the BMSCs or exposed to BMSC-conditioned
medium. We also used intracellular cytokine staining by FACS to
compare the number of IL-10–producing monocytes and macro￾phages isolated from treated versus untreated septic mice and found
a significantly higher number of IL-10–producing monocytes and
macrophages in the treated mice (Fig. 4e).
Because IL-10 has been reported to inhibit the rolling, adhesion19
and transepithelial migration20–22 of neutrophils, we examined the
white cell counts in the circulation of treated and untreated CLP mice
and found a significant increase in the number of circulating neu￾trophils in the treated mice (Fig. 3a). It is possible that the high
circulating neutrophil counts in the BMSC-treated mice could help
lower blood bacterial counts (Fig. 4f), but further studies are
necessary to explore this hypothesis. Neutrophils are also known to
migrate into the tissues in septic states, where they can cause oxidative
organ damage23–25, an unwanted side effect of myeloperoxidase, an
enzyme that neutrophils use to eliminate bacteria26. To see whether a
change in myeloperoxidase abundance could contribute to BMSC￾related organ protection, we measured the amount of myeloperoxidase
in the kidney and liver of septic mice with and without BMSC
treatment. We found that the amount of myeloperoxidase was
significantly decreased (Fig. 4g) in the mice that received BMSC
injections, which would be consistent with the lack of neutrophil
invasion and the lesser extent of organ damage. The above data
suggest that the intravenously injected BMSCs are able to optimally
balance circulating and tissue-bound immune cells to maximize
bacterial killing in the circulation while minimizing organ damage
due to leukocyte invasion.
Molecular basis of the BMSC-macrophage interaction
To understand the molecular basis of the interaction between BMSCs
and macrophages, we performed a series of experiments in vitro and
in vivo. Wild-type BMSCs showed NF-kB activation 30 min after LPS
stimulation (Fig. 5a). In a number of cell types, NF-kB has been shown
to induce prostaglandin production and release through a pathway
involving cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2; refs. 26–29). BMSCs have been
shown to produce prostaglandin E2 and possibly affect other immune
cells via EP1–EP4 receptors30,31. We found a significant increase in the
expression and activity of COX2 (which produces the substrate for
prostaglandin synthase enzymes) in BMSCs 3 h and 5 h after LPS
stimulation (Fig. 5b,c), but when the BMSCs were treated with an
antibody to TNF-a or collected from Tlr4–/– mice, the COX2 expres￾sion did not change (Fig. 5d). This suggested that prostaglandin E2

might indeed be responsible for reprogramming the macrophages. For
this reason, we measured the amount of prostaglandin E2 in the
coculture medium and found a significant increase in its concentration
after LPS stimulation (Fig. 5e). This increase was eliminated if the
BMSCs lacked TLR4 or if they were incubated with antibody to TNF-a
(Fig. 5e). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibition resulted in
a significant reduction of COX2 enzyme activity 1 h, 3 h and 5 h after
LPS stimulation (Fig. 5f). Although IL-10 concentrations in the
medium were increased by LPS when BMSCs from Ptgs1–/– mice
(lacking COX1) were used in the assay or when the cells were treated
with a COX1 inhibitor (SC-560), the increased IL-10 release was not
seen when Ptgs2–/– cells (lacking COX2) were used or a COX2 inhibitor
(NS-398) was added (Fig. 6a).
To further examine the effect of BMSCs on macrophages, we
cultured macrophages with BMSCs, added LPS and measured the
IL-10 concentration in the culture medium. Because Toll-like
receptor-4 (TLR4) is the receptor to which LPS binds and through
which it acts32, we were not surprised to see that BMSCs from Tlr4–/–
mice could not increase IL-10 production and secretion in our assay
(Fig. 6a). Myeloid differentiation primary response gene-88 (MyD88)

BMSC and macrophages. (a) IL-10 concentration
changes in supernatants of cocultures in a variety
of treatment conditions after LPS stimulation.
Colored graphs (except for the blue color that
labels the bone marrow macrophages as the
source of all consecutive experiments) show
treatments that eliminate the effect of BMSCs
on macrophages. Black graphs show IL-10 levels
after LPS stimulation, whereas open graphs
show the control (nonstimulated) values. The
experiments where the conditions eliminated the
effect are colored. Purple color shows the effect
of septic environment, green color shows agents
and cellular compartments related to the PGE2
pathway and pink color shows agents related to
the nitric oxide pathway. Three separate kinds
of macrophages (bone marrow macrophages;
peritoneal macrophages and the RAW264.7
cell line) were examined initially. Because they
behaved identically in the assay, we used bone
marrow derived macrophages (BM MF) for the
rest of the experiments. In the box labeled 1, the effect of septic environment on the BMSCs is studied in BMSCs from TLR4-, MyD88-, TNFR1- and
TNFR2- deficient mice, or antibody to TNF-a was used to neutralize the effect of TNF. The box labeled with 2 shows the cytokines and agents that have been
implicated in the literature in immunomodulation of T cells by BMSCs, including COX1/2 and iNOS inhibitors. The box labeled 3 shows studies of the COX2
pathway, including the prostaglandin receptors EP1–EP4. Finally, in the box labeled with 4, we show studies related to nitric oxide. (b) A summary of our
current hypothesis about the mechanisms that underlie the interactions between BMSCs and macrophages in the CLP sepsis model. Bacterial toxins (for
example, LPS) and circulating TNF-a act on the TLR4 and TNFR-1 of the BMSCs, respectively. This results in the translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus.
This activation process seems to be nitric oxide dependent. Activated NF-kB induces the production of COX2, resulting in increased production and release
of PGE2. PGE2 binds to EP2 and EP4 receptors on the macrophage, increasing its IL-10 secretion and reducing inflammation.

is required for activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) by TLR4, and
cells from Myd88–/– mice did not stimulate IL-10 secretion either
(Fig. 6a). Because TNF-a has also been implicated in upregulating
NF-kB in BMSCs, and both TNF receptor-1 (TNFR-1) and TNFR-2
have been reported to be present in BMSCs33, we next tested whether
these receptors are involved in the function. We used antibody to
TNF-a and BMSCs from Tnfrsf1a–/– or Tnfrsf1b–/– mice and found
that TNF-a and TNFR-1 are also necessary for the activation
of BMSCs (Fig. 6a). In the absence of TNFR-2, BMSCs still increased
IL-10 concentrations in the cocultures (Fig. 6a).
Because it seemed that prostaglandin E2 might mediate the effect of
BMSCs on macrophage cytokine production, we asked whether
specific EP receptors could be involved in transducing the prostaglan￾din signal. To answer this question, we used prostaglandin receptor
antagonists and macrophages from EP receptor–knockout mice. EP1
and EP3 receptor antagonists had no effect on LPS-induced IL-10
secretion, and neither did substituting Ptger1–/– macrophages (lacking
the gene encoding prostaglandin E receptor-1) or Ptger3–/– macro￾phages (lacking the gene encoding prostaglandin E receptor-3) for
wild-type cells in the assay (Fig. 6a). However, both EP2 and EP4
receptor antagonists prevented the increase in IL-10 secretion, as did
using Ptger2–/– or Ptger4–/– macrophages instead of wild-type ones
(Fig. 6a). TNFR-1 and TLR4 do not seem to be the only elements in
the BMSCs required for COX2 induction. Nitric oxide produced in the
BMSCs, the macrophages or both may be involved. Using BMSCs
from Nos2–/– mice with WT macrophages or Nos2–/– mice macro￾phages with WT BMSCs did not eliminate the effect on IL-10
production (Fig. 6a). However, when BMSCs and macrophages
were both derived from Nos2–/– mice (lacking iNOS-2), IL-10 was
not induced (Fig. 6a). To show that this effect is specifically related to
loss of iNOS activity and reduced production of nitric oxide, we added
S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), an external nitric oxide
donor, to the system34. SNAP fully restored the ability of Nos2–/–
cells to increase IL-10 production in response to LPS (Fig. 6a). To
determine whether nitric oxide might act through guanylyl cyclase in
the BMSCs, we pretreated these cells with 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-
a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), an irreversible inhibitor of soluble gua￾nylyl cyclase35 (Fig. 6a). The IL-10 increase was eliminated when the
BMSCs, but not the macrophages, were treated with ODQ. This
suggests that the BMSCs need nitric oxide to achieve the effect on
IL-10. Apparently, the nitric oxide can either be produced by the
BMSCs themselves or by the macrophages. Thus, on the basis of our
in vitro studies, we concluded that BMSCs respond to the presence of
infectious agents by increasing prostaglandin E2 synthesis and secre￾tion, and that subsequent activation of prostaglandin E2 and E4
receptors on the macrophages results in IL-10 induction. We tested
this hypothesis in vivo, and, as predicted, BMSCs lacking TNFR1,
MyD88 or COX2 all failed to rescue mice subjected to CLP
(Supplementary Fig. 5 online). Cells from Tlr4–/– mice had partial
efficacy, reflecting the fact that their detection of pathogens is
impaired but not absent (Supplementary Fig. 5), raising the possibi￾lity of the involvement of other TLRs in vivo.
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that an intravenous injection of bone marrow
stromal cells can beneficially modulate the response of the host
immune system to sepsis and improve survival. BMSCs were first
reported to have a potent immunosuppressive effect in vivo in humans
in 2004, when a young individual with resistant graft-versus-host
disease was successfully treated with transplanted haploidentical
mesenchymal stem cells2. Subsequently, cases of hemorrhagic cystitis
and peritonitis were treated with allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells5.
Thus, in humans and in animals3,36–39, bone marrow stromal cells
seem to be potent immunomodulators, but their mechanism of action
has been unclear. BMSCs are known to inhibit T cell proliferation4
and to modulate B cell function40. In the present study, we show that
BMSCs can be used to fight sepsis in mice. We suggest that the
injected BMSCs interact with circulating and tissue (mostly lung)
monocytes and macrophages and reprogram them. Treated monocytes
and macrophages produce large amounts of IL-10, and the treatment
decreases the amounts of circulating TNF-a and IL-6. This reduces
harm caused by unbridled immune responses to the host tissues. The
observation that the macrophages isolated from treated septic mice
produce significantly higher amounts of IL-10 than those from
nontreated mice suggest a temporary reprogramming of monocyte
and macrophage function that persists for at least 12 h. The monocyte
and macrophage–derived IL-10 seems to prevent neutrophils from
migrating into tissues and causing oxidative damage, thus mitigating
multiorgan damage. This inhibition of neutrophil migration into
tissues also results in a buildup of neutrophils in the blood, allowing
for more efficient bacterial clearance. The combination of our in vitro
and in vivo experiments shows that the beneficial effect is likely to be
due to an increased release of prostaglandin E2 from the BMSCs acting
on the EP2 and EP4 receptors of the macrophages and stimulating the
production and release of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine
(Fig. 6b). Simultaneous stimulation of EP2 and EP4 receptor subtypes
by prostaglandin E2 has been shown to promote monocyte-derived
dendritic cell maturation41. In peritoneal macrophages, prostaglandin
E2 was shown to modulate inflammatory reactions via the EP2 and
EP4 receptors42, and EP2 and EP4 agonists were shown to cause
upregulation of zymosan-induced IL-10 production42. Because both
of these receptors work through cyclic AMP, one wonders why both
are necessary for the effect to take place. Why eliminating either the
EP2 or the EP4 receptor affects IL-10 induction remains to be
determined. The two receptors could increase cyclic AMP levels
more when they act in concert than they do alone, or they could
have partially nonoverlapping actions that are essential for induction
to occur43. It is also possible that the receptors form functional
heterodimers in macrophages.
Our model is somewhat similar to peritonitis in humans. The
mechanism of how BMSCs are beneficial might be universal in
infectious diseases, or it might be unique to this model. It is possible
that the mechanism described could be harmful in other models or
that there are other beneficial mechanisms related to BMSCs in other
infectious or noninfectious diseases. Owing to the effectiveness of
BMSCs in the CLP model, and because BMSCs have been successfully
given to humans2,44 and can easily be cultured and used without
human leukocyte antigen matching, we suggest that cultured, banked
human BMSCs should be tested for their ability to prevent sepsis in
very high-risk groups.
METHODS
Mice. Mouse care was in full compliance with the US NIH criteria for the care
and use of laboratory animals in research and all studies were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of the NIDDK and NIDCR, NIH. Aged (42–
44 weeks old) male C57BL/6 mice (NIH) had free access to water and chow
before and after surgery. In addition, 8–12-week-old males with a variety of
genetic manipulations were used as listed in the Supplementary Methods
online. All reagents used are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 online.
Polymicrobial cecal ligation and puncture sepsis. We performed CLP as
previously described, with some modifications, in C57BL/6 mice45,46. We
ligated the cecum by silk 4-0 and punctured it twice with a 21-gauge needle,

gently squeezed it to express a small amount of fecal material and then returned
it to the central abdominal cavity. In sham-operated mice, we located the
cecum but neither ligated nor punctured it. We closed the abdominal incision
in two layers with 6-0 nylon sutures. After surgery, we gave 1 ml per 30 g body
weight of pre-warmed normal saline. All mice received antibiotic and
fluid therapy subcutaneously (a combination of imipenem and cilastatin;
14 mg per kg in 1.5 ml of normal saline at 6 h and 7 mg per kg in 1.5 ml
of normal saline at 18 h after surgery). The details of the tissue harvest are
described in the Supplementary Methods.
Treatment of cecal ligation and puncture mice with bone marrow stromal
cells. We injected one million BMSCs in 0.3 ml sterile PBS via the tail vein. We
gave untreated control mice 0.3 ml sterile PBS with no cells. There was no
difference in organ injury, cytokine abundance, Evans blue dye level or
pathology in the sham-operated mice with or without BMSC injection. Details
of cell isolation and culture are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Survival studies. We assessed survival after surgery every 6 h within the first
48 h and then every 8 h for 4 d. We began antibiotic injection and fluid
resuscitation 6 h after CLP by subcutaneous injection and repeated it every 12 h
for 4 d. We killed all mice at the end of the fourth day.
Ex vivo studies on isolated lung monocytes and macrophages. We killed
septic mice 6 h after CLP induction with or without intravenous injection of
1 million BMSCs. We removed the lungs, minced them into small pieces and
incubated the pieces in RPMI 1640 medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin
and 1% glutamine for 30 min at 37 1C 5% CO2 in the presence of collagenase
type 1 (300 U ml–1) and DNase I (50 U ml–1) (Worthington Biochemicals).
After the incubation, we filtered the cell suspension through a 70-mm cell
strainer and then washed it with complete RPMI medium. We incubated the
resulting cells for 15 min at 4 1C with CD11b magnetic beads and subsequently
applied them to MS columns (Miltenyi) for the positive selection of CD11b
cells. The cell purity of the CD11b+ cells, as assessed by FACS analysis, was
greater than 97%. After washing, we plated the isolated cells in 96-well plates at
a concentration of 50,000 cells per well per 200 ml RPMI medium (with 10%
FBS, 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) containing 10 mg ml–1 LPS
(from Escherichia coli O111:B4, Sigma). We incubated cells for 1, 3, 5 and 7 h
after stimulation and collected supernatants sequentially from wells dedicated
to each time point. For each time point, we used triplicate wells. We collected
supernatants in microtubes, spun the tubes down at maximum speed for
10 min to get rid of cell debris, aliquoted the supernatants and froze them at
–20 1C until use. We performed ELISA for IL-10 (R&D Systems) on the
samples. We made measurements in duplicates from three independent
experiments. To determine intracellular amounts of IL-10 produced in lung
cells, we prepared single-cell suspensions as described above and plated cells in
six-well plates containing 10 mg ml–1 LPS and 3 mg ml–1 brefeldin A, a Golgi￾blocking agent frequently used to prepare samples for intracellular FACS
analysis. After 5 h of LPS restimulation, we collected the cells, washed them
and performed intracellular IL-10 staining combined with cell surface staining.
Macrophage–bone marrow stromal cells coculture experiments. First, we
plated macrophages in 96-well plates at a concentration of 40,000 cells per
200 ml. After 1 h, we removed the supernatants and added either 40,000 BMSCs
in fresh medium or fresh medium alone to the wells. As a control, we plated
BMSCs without macrophages. After an overnight incubation, we added LPS to
the cocultures to reach a final concentration of 1 mg ml–1. We collected
supernatants 1, 3, 5 and 7 h after the stimulation and performed ELISA
(R&D Systems) on the samples to detect the released IL-10. For the transwell or
conditioned medium experiments, we either added BMSCs on the insert
membrane of the transwell system (HTS Transwell 0.4-mm pore size poly￾carbonate membrane, from Corning Incorporated) or added conditioned
medium diluted 1:1 with fresh medium to the macrophages. For generation
of BMSC-conditioned medium, we cultured BMSCs in complete medium.
After 3 d, we collected supernatants, spun them down to remove possible
cell contamination (500g for 10 min) and stored the resulting supernatants
at –20 1C until further use. Further details on ELISA and western blotting are in
the Supplementary Methods.
Blood chemistry, natural killer cell and macrophage depletion and IL-10
neutralization, microvascular permeability, bacterial counts, cell tracking,
histology and flow cytometry. Detailed methodology is described in the
Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analyses. We examined the differences between the groups for
statistical significance by Student’s t-test or analysis of variance with an
appropriate correction. We compared survival curves with a log-rank test
(Prism 4.0; Graphpad Software). A P value of o0.05 was accepted as
statistically significant.

been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the article.
Corrigendum: Bone marrow stromal cells attenuate sepsis via prostaglandin 
E2–dependent reprogramming of host macrophages to increase their 
interleukin-10 production
Krisztián Németh, Asada Leelahavanichkul, Peter S T Yuen, Balázs Mayer, Alissa Parmelee, Kent Doi, Pamela G Robey, 
Kantima Leelahavanichkul, Beverly H Koller, Jared M Brown, Xuzhen Hu, Ivett Jelinek, Robert A Star & Éva Mezey

In the version of this article initially published, the labeling in (Figure 4) was incorrect. In panel (b), the cells in the left two FACS plots are shown 
based on their size (FSC, y axis) and CD11b expression (x axis), and the cells in the right two FACS plots are shown based on their F4/80 expression 
(y axis) and GR1 expression (x axis). In panel (c), the curves should start at 1 h. In panel (d), the text labeling the y axis should read “in vitro,” not 
“in vivo.” The errors have been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of this article.
Corrigendum: The cerebral cavernous malformation signaling pathway 
promotes vascular integrity via Rho GTPases

In the version of this article initially published, a “left” and “right” designation was switched in the legend for Figure 4d. The legend should read 
“FCICA of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells from the four protected vaccinees, examining the response of these cells to SIV proteins that were (Rev￾Tat-Nef) or were not (Pol and Vif) expressed by the administered RhCMV vectors before (left) and 133 d after (right) initiation of the SIVmac239 
intrarectal challenge protocol.” The error has been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the article.
