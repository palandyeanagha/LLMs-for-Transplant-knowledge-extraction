Abstract
Background: Unlike other autoimmune liver diseases, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has never been reported in
early childhood, while type 2 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is eminently a paediatric disease.
Case presentation: We describe a case of type 2 AIH with serological positivity for PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial
antibodies (AMA) in a 3-year old girl. We found this observation intriguing as AMA and indeed an overlap with PBC
are virtually absent in Type 2 AIH, a pediatric form of AIH which is distinct precisely because it is characterized by
pathognomonic anti-liver kidney microsomal type 1 (LKM-1) showing a remarkable antigen-specificity directed
against cytochrome P4502D6. We also review the literature in relation to AMA positivity in paediatric age and
adolescence. In our case, the presence of AIH-2-specific anti-LKM-1 and PBC-specific AMA was confirmed by indirect
immunofluorescence (IIF), and immunoblotting and ELISA based on recombinant mitochondrial antigens. The
clinical, laboratory and histological features of the child are given in detail. Interestingly the mother was AMA
positive without other features of PBC. The child was successfully treated with immunosuppression and five years
after the original diagnosis is on a low dose of prednisolone and azathioprine, with no signs of relapse. Anti-LKM-1
antibodies are still present in low titres. AMA were detectable for the first 4 years after the diagnosis and
disappeared later.
Conclusion: This is the first case report in the literature of AIH type 2 with an unexpected PBC-specific AMA
positivity in a young child. Response to immunosuppressive treatment was satisfactory and similar to that described
in AIH. A review of published reports on AMA positivity in paediatric age shows that the antibody may arise in the
context of immunodeficiency and is variably associated with liver damage.

Background
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) typically affects middle
aged women and has never been reported in previously
healthy young children, although affected adolescents
have been described [1-22]. The disease is characterized
by an immune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile
ducts and the presence of high-titer anti-mitochondrial
antibodies (AMA) against the E2 subunit of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2) [3,9,11-13,23-39].
AMA are highly specific for PBC, and can be detected in
approximately 95% of patients when sensitive diagnostic
immunoassays are used [3,6,9,11-13,18,21,23-38,40-50].
The etiology of the disease remains elusive, but is
believed to derive from a combination of factors includ￾ing a multi-lineage loss of immunological tolerance to
PDC-E2 [10,13,15,16,29-31,33,36,43-45,51-84], genetic
susceptibility [6,9,11,22,51,77,85-111] and exposure to
environmental triggers [51,52,58,112-135]. Descriptive
epidemiological studies strongly suggest that the inci￾dence and prevalence of PBC are increasing [136-140].
We herein describe the unusual case of a 3-year-old girl
with overlapping autoimmune hepatitis type 2 (AIH-2)
and PBC-specific AMA positivity. She presented with
acute liver failure with no evidence of infections, meta￾bolic and genetic liver disease or other causes of acute
liver disease. The autoantibody testing revealed the pres￾ence of anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM-1)
and PBC-specific AMA, the autoantibody markers of
AIH-2 and PBC, respectively. Though histological findings
did not demonstrate typical overlap of PBC and AIH, they
were compatible with both AIH and overlapping biliary
features. AMA were also detected in the mother’s serum
samples.
Over a seven-year period, 3808 paediatric patients with
liver disease were screened in a single tertiary center in
Northern Italy, Bergamo, for the presence of serum
autoantibodies. The screening program included chil￾dren with acute or chronic liver diseases in the course of
evaluation for inclusion onto a waiting list for orthotopic
liver transplant (OLT), or during follow-up after OLT.
Throughout that period, 340 paediatric OLT were per￾formed. Out of 3808 tested patients, only 2 tested posi￾tive for AMA by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF),
which was confirmed by western blot with recombinant
antigens. The first one presented with acute liver failure
(ALF) with massive hepatic necrosis, was transplanted
and spontaneously lost AMA after OLT. The second one
is herein described. To our knowledge, this is the first
child with AIH type 2 and AMA positivity documented
at the level of individual PBC-specific mitochondrial
antigens ever reported.
Case report
SM, a 3-year-old previously healthy girl, came to medical
attention because of progressive jaundice, fatigue and
anorexia. She was admitted to a local hospital and on
examination was found to be icteric with hepato￾splenomegaly but no ascites. No prior history of early
deaths, liver disease or autoimmunity existed in the fam￾ily. Laboratory tests indicated cholestatic hepatitis with￾out impaired liver function (Table 1). However, her
condition deteriorated within 24 hours with features of
acute liver failure (International normalized prothrom￾bin ratio [INR] 2, increasing hyper-ammoniemia from 55
to 105 and up to 196 mMol/L) and neurological deteri￾oration. Five days later, she was admitted to the Pediatric
Liver Transplant Centre (Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo)
with stage I hepatic encephalopathy. Ultrasound examin￾ation demonstrated a hyper-echogenic left hepatic seg￾ment with structural alteration, suggestive of chronic
parenchymal damage.

AMA and LKM were strongly positive (> 1:640), and
total serum IgG and IgM levels were elevated. The la￾boratory tests excluded viral infections (hepatitis virus
A, B, C, D, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr,
cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus), metabolic
and genetic alterations (Wilson disease, haemochroma￾tosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). Liver biopsy
was contraindicated because of the coagulation
abnormalities.
Based on the clinical and laboratory findings, i.v. ther￾apy with methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) and cyclo￾sporine (continuous infusion at doses of 2–3 mg/kg/day
in order to maintain a blood level up to 300 ng/ml) was
started. During the following 36 hours, hepatic encephal￾opathy progressed to stage III and hepatic function dete￾riorated (Table 1), and the child was listed for urgent
OLT. However the child improved in the following days
with complete neurological recovery and she was
removed from the transplant list. One week after the be￾ginning of therapy, the hepatic function was normal, and
steroid tapering was initiated one month later. In the fol￾lowing 3 months, steroids were decreased and cyclospor￾ine was switched to azathioprine (50 mg/day).
Repeated laboratory tests confirmed the presence of
both anti-LKM-1 antibodies by IIF (Figure 1)
[48,141,142] and AMA by western blot with recombin￾ant antigen [13] (Figure 2) over a two year period. Sero￾positivity for PBC-specific autoantibody responses were
also confirmed using an a PBC profile ELISA based on a
mixture of the triple MIT3 hybroid and PBC-specific
ANA gp210 and sp100 peptides (Quanta Lite PBC pro￾file, INOVA Diagnostics, San Diego, California, USA).
Serum samples were negative for PBC-specific ANA by
IIF. At the time of the diagnosis, both parents were alive
and in good health, and no autoimmune diseases were
reported in first grade relatives. Sera from the parents,
maternal and paternal grandparents and one maternal
uncle were also collected and tested for the presence of
autoantibodies. The child’s mother was found to be posi￾tive for AMA directed against the major PBC-specific
mitochondrial autoantigen, but had no symptoms or
signs of liver disease (Figure 2).
A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed 4 weeks
after presentation, when the INR normalized. Ductular
structures were stained using cytokeratin 7 (CK-7) (Neo￾Markers, Freemont, USA, working dilution 1:200), a
marker selectively expressed by the biliary epithelial cells
in the human liver. Histological examination showed a
normal liver architecture with mild mixed inflammatory
infiltrate and minimal portal fibrosis. Immunohisto￾chemical staining for CK-7 demonstrated marked prolif￾eration of medium and small sized bile ducts in portal
and periportal areas. Focal hepatocytes demonstrated
biliary metaplasia which was evident by the same immu￾nohistochemical staining. Mixed steatosis was observed
in about 20% of liver cells (Figure ss3). Portal tracts were

expanded, fibrotic and oedematous, with a moderate in￾flammatory infiltrate, mainly represented by lymphocytes
with spill-over features and isolated granulocytes. Inter￾lobular bile ducts were affected by destructive lesions
with focal destruction of basal membrane by inflamma￾tory cells, occasionally migrating within the biliary epi￾thelium. Typical histological lesions of PBC are difficult
to be seen in the context of concomitant features of
acute severe hepatitis related to AIH. It is possible that
the first cycle of corticosteroid therapy had a stronger ef￾fect in ameliorating the hepatitis component, thereby
allowing the cholangiopatic component (which is less
likely to be responsive to corticosteroid therapy) to be￾come more evident once the subacute lesions
disappeared.
Five years after the acute episode, the child is on a low
dose of steroid (prednisone 5 mg/day) and azathioprine
(50 mg/day), with normal liver function. AMA and anti￾LKM-1 remained positive for four years; in the course of
the 5th follow up year, AMA became undetectable while
anti-LKM-1 remained positive (January 2011).
Discussion
We herein present the rare finding of type 2 AIH with
the unexpected presence of AMA. Unlike other auto￾immune liver diseases, typical features of PBC have
never been reported in early childhood. Reported
paediatric autoimmune liver disorders include AIH types
1 and 2, and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC)
[17]. The diagnosis of ASC relies on cholangiographic
imaging changes. AIH type 2 is less frequent than AIH-1,
affects mainly children and young adults and has a more
aggressive course, leading to fulminant hepatic failure
more often than type 1 AIH. In general, AIH responds
satisfactorily to immunosuppressive treatment, with
AIH-2 usually requiring treatment for life. The positive
response to immunosuppression of the present case, in
addition to the high titer of anti-LKM-1 antibodies,
strongly supports the AIH component of the disease.
Anti-LKM-1 antibodies in AIH-2 are specifically directed
against cytochrome P4502D6. In addition to AIH-2, anti￾LKM-1 is present in a minor proportion of chronic
HCV-infected patients. HCV infection was ruled out in
the present case of AIH-2. A diagnosis compatible with
PBC has been considered on the basis of the presence of
PBC-specific AMA, evidence of cholestasis and histo￾logical lesions - not typical of PBC such as the granu￾lomatous destruction of septal or interlobular bile ducts,
but indicative of portal tract inflammation and ductular
damage [13].
The presence of PBC-specific AMA in this case is in￾triguing. AMA are highly specific for PBC, and often
precede the development of liver damage by several
years, even in individuals who are asymptomatic and do

peri-portal hepatocytes (40 X).

not have any other evidence of chronic liver disease [13].
Although the mechanisms leading to the generation of
AMA are unknown, it has been postulated that
xenobiotic-induced and/or oxidative modification of
mitochondrial autoantigens is a critical step leading to
loss of immunological tolerance.
Paediatric PBC
Another intriguing finding of the present case is that
PBC-specific AMA was present in conjunction with evi￾dence of biliary epithelial cell destruction, diagnosed at
the age of 3. The presence of AMA in the present case
raises the question as to whether PBC has been reported
among paediatric patients. The youngest child previously
described with PBC was a six year old female [35]
(Table 2). The remaining cases of ‘paediatric’ PBC have
been described in adolescents [1,2]. Dahlan and collea￾gues reported two females aged 11 and 16 years, with
confirmed PBC [2]. The first patient presented at 11 years
of age with abdominal pain and raised aspartate amino￾transferase (AST) (48 U/L; normal values <35 U/L), but
all other liver biochemistry tests (including ALP) were
normal (γGT was not tested) [2]. Her abdominal pain
continued and liver function tests demonstrated a raised
γGT (107 U/L) at the age of 15, when she was found to
be positive for AMA by IIF (1:800), although the specifi￾city of the AMA was not stated [2]. No other autoanti￾bodies were detected [2]. Her serum IgG and IgA were
normal but IgM was raised [2]. A liver biopsy at age 16
showed stage II PBC (damaged segmental bile ducts
with portal and periportal lymphoid infiltrates), and
liver function tests at age 18 demonstrated a cholestatic
profile with raised ALP (660 U/L) and slight increase of
total bilirubin (24 μmol/L) [2]. It was at this phase that
she developed symptoms of pruritus, fatigue and weight
loss [2]. She was transplanted at age 21 following wor￾sening of symptoms and increasingly abnormal liver
biochemistry despite ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
treatment [2]. Histology of the explanted liver demon￾strated stage IV PBC. An intriguing aspect of that case
is her strong family history of liver disease, as the
mother presented at the age of 30 with overlapping fea￾tures of PBC and AIH, and received a liver transplant￾ation at the age of 34 [2]. Additionally, the grandmother
and great-grandmother on the maternal side died of
liver cirrhosis of unknown origin [2]. This is of interest
given that the mother of the child in the current report
is also AMA positive, suggesting a possible genetic pre￾disposition. In the second case, a 16 year old female pre￾sented with Raynaud’s and Sicca syndromes as well as
raised AST (163 U/L), and was found to be positive for
AMA (1:160). She was also positive for ANA (1:320) but
it is not clear whether these ANA were those specific
for PBC. (i.e. with a multiple nuclear dot or a rim like
membranous pattern) [2]. Serum IgG and IgA were nor￾mal, but IgM was raised [2]. Histology confirmed stage
II PBC at the age of 17 years, and she was started on
UDCA (2 g/day), with improvement of her symptoms
and liver biochemical tests [2].

cases occur due to underlying genetic deficiencies such
as IPEX syndrome or IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Rα) defi￾ciency [37,143]. IPEX syndrome is a congenital disorder
of immune regulation caused by mutations in the
FOXP3 gene, which is required for the suppressive func￾tion of naturally arising CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells
[143-145]. Tsuda et al. [37] note that patients with IPEX
syndrome produce a variety of autoantibodies including
AMA. Mutations in the FOXP3 gene (located on the
centromeric region of the X chromosome) lead to
decreased CD4 + CD25+ Tregs [63,64,146], and therefore
failure to suppress the production of autoreactive T cells
and multi-organ autoimmunity [37]. Tsuda and collea￾gues note that one individual in their study, an 11 year
old male with IPEX, was positive for AMA, with no clin￾ical or biochemical evidence of liver disease [37]. The
AMA in that case was of the IgA isotype, with no AMA
of the IgG isotype identified, and the plasma IgM and
IgA levels were also raised [37]. It was not stated
whether the AMA in that case was directed against
PDC-E2, and it is unknown whether the child in that
case eventually went on to develop PBC [37]. Aoki et al.
[143] report the case of a male child born to consan￾guineous parents, who initially presented with recurrent
infections at six months of age. At five years of age, liver
biochemistry showed an elevated GGT, and a liver bi￾opsy demonstrated mononuclear lymphocyte infiltration
of the portal tracts [143]. These findings differ from
the typical histological appearance of PBC, which
includes non-suppurative cholangitis, ductopaenia, and
sporadically non-caseating granuloma formation. The
infant also had CD3+ CD25+ lymphocytopaenia lead￾ing to an abnormal CD4:CD8 ratio [143]. Infectious
causes were ruled out, but antibody testing was posi￾tive for AMA, with reactivity to PDC-E2. Immuno￾blotting of peripheral lymphocytes showed the
absence of the IL-2Rα. A thymic biopsy showed ab￾sent CD1a and increased Bcl-2 (an anti-apoptotic pro￾tein) expression, due to a four point mutation in
FOXP3 leading to translational frameshift, which is
similar to IPEX syndrome [143]. The authors sug￾gested that the lack of CD4 + CD25+ Tregs led to a
proliferation of autoreactive T cells which were not
induced to apoptose due to an increased Bcl-2 [143].
In turn, these autoreactive T cells contributed to the
development of PBC (or PBC-like pathology), likely
via close interaction with B cells [143,144]. The child
in this case underwent myeloablative chemotherapy
and allogenic stem cell transplantation, with complete
resolution of his symptoms and no residual serological
reactivity to recombinant PDC-E2 [143]. As men￾tioned, these cases do not represent true paediatric
PBC, as the underlying pathological process was
linked to a genetic deficiency.
Antimitochondrial antibodies in liver disease-free
paediatric cases
The presence of AMA is highly suggestive of PBC, or
predicts progression of an asymptomatic patient to overt
PBC [13,36]. However, Zamfir et al. [83] noted the pres￾ence of AMA in 10 of 900 patients presenting with
extrahepatic disorders. Of those patients, nine were pre￾senting with haematological disease and one with a der￾matological condition [83]. Eight of the ten had high
AMA titres, with the remaining two having low titres,
but the presence of AMA was confirmed by immuno￾blot. The immunodominant antigen in all positive AMA
cases confirmed by immunoblot was PDC-E2 [83]. It is
not known if there was also reactivity to other PBC spe￾cific AMA antigens such as the E2 subunits of branched
chain oxoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC-E2)
and oxoglutarate complex (OGDC-E2) [13,26]. Interest￾ingly three of the 10 patients were under the age of 20,
at 19, 15 and 6 years of age [83]. All three of these indi￾viduals were male, and had significant AMA titres, as
well as positive ANA of unknown specificity [83]. The
presenting disorders among the three were haemato￾logical, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, thrombocyto￾paenia and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura,
respectively [83]. It should be noted that in the case of
the 15 year old, the AMA appearance by IIF were atyp￾ical (non-anti-M2), and the positivity was not confirmed
by immunoblot. It is therefore reasonable to speculate
that this case may represent a non-PBC related AMA or
a false positive AMA test. The 19 and 6 year old cases
had AMA titers of greater than 1/640, and the presence
of AMA was confirmed by immunoblotting [83]. These
patients were unusual not only due to their young age,
but also because they were male. Of the remaining 7
AMA positive patients with extrahepatic disorders, six
were female [83]. It has been suggested that these
patients may eventually go on to develop PBC, but
whether this occurred or not is unknown, as no liver bi￾opsy or follow-up studies were performed.
Antimitochondrial antibodies in cases with non-PBC
related liver disease
Unlike the above study where no liver disease was
reported in the presence of high AMA titres, Gregorio
et al. [26] report a 12 year old girl with autoimmune
hepatitis type 1 who was AMA anti-M2 positive. This
patient initially presented with a four month history of
jaundice, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, and on
examination was found to have hepatosplenomegaly and
liver disease stigmata [26]. Her serum bilirubin and ALT
were elevated, but all other liver biochemistry was nor￾mal. She had increased IgG and was positive for PBC￾specific anti-M2 AMA (titre 1/640) [26]. The presence
of anti-M2 AMA was confirmed by western blot analysis
Invernizzi et al. BMC Gastroenterology 2012, 12:92 Page 6 of 11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/12/92

[26]. Immunological testing for ANA, anti-smooth
muscle antibody, and anti-LKM-1 were negative [26].
Histological assessment of six liver biopsies taken over
several years showed chronic hepatitis with varying
degrees of inflammation, but no evidence of PBC [26].
Treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine improved
her condition, and her transaminases normalised, but
she had three episodes of spontaneous bacterial periton￾itis and four episodes of relapse due to poor treatment
compliance [26]. Twelve years after her initial diagnosis,
she developed liver failure and died following an intra￾peritoneal haemorrhage. Liver tissue obtained at autopsy
confirmed cirrhosis with persistent inflammation, but no
features confirmatory of or compatible with PBC [26].
Over the twelve years since diagnosis, she remained
AMA positive, with titers ranging from 1/40 to 1/1280.
She did not develop Sicca syndrome, systemic sclerosis
or any other rheumatological condition associated with
AMA positivity or PBC [26]. Her low IgM and ALP, as
well as the lack of histological PBC features, are atypical
for “overlap” between autoimmune hepatitis and PBC
seen in adults [13,26,142].
Transplacental passage of AMA and neonatal liver disease
Hannam et al. [28] report two cases of neonatal liver dis￾ease, in which the transplacental passage of AMA oc￾curred. The first case was that of a female infant born to
a 32 year old mother with a three year history of pruritus
and joint pain, who was AMA positive with normal liver
function tests. The foetus was found to be hydropic, and
required three intrauterine transfusions before delivery
at 31 weeks by caesarean section [28]. The infant dis￾played deranged liver function tests, and was positive for
AMA (titre 1/160) and ANA (1/20) [28]. These autoanti￾bodies were present in the mother at the same titre, and
both had the same antibody epitope recognition pattern
to PDC-E2 and PDC-E3 binding protein (also known as
PDC-X), recognising the major epitopic regions on these
antigens [28]. Over several weeks the infant’s condition
and liver function tests improved, and the autoantibodies
became undetectable. The second case involved a male
infant born to a 28 year old mother following an un￾eventful pregnancy. The infant presented at five weeks
with poor weight gain, jaundice, pale stools and an ery￾thematous rash [28]. Liver function tests were deranged,
and an antibody screen was positive for AMA (titre 1/20)
and ANA (1/10) [28]. The mother was also positive for
the same antibodies at the same titre, but she was asymp￾tomatic and had normal liver biochemistry [28]. Titres of
1/10 and 1/20 based on IIF using liver, kidney, stomach
tissues are considered significant in children, though in
adults titers are considered positive if they exceed 1/40.
Antibodies in both mother and child had an identical
epitope recognition pattern to PDC-E2 and PDC-E3
binding protein [28]. A liver biopsy of the infant demon￾strated cholestasis with hepatitis and mild portal fibrosis
[28]. Over the course of three months the infant's condi￾tion improved, liver biochemistry normalised, and the
antibodies became undetectable [28]. In both cases the
AMA were demonstrated to be maternal in origin, as in
both infants they were of the placenta-crossing IgG1 and
IgG 3 class, their concentrations declining over several
weeks [28]. The epitope recognition pattern was also the
same in both infant-mother pairs [28]. These cases are of
interest given the transplacental passage of AMA, and its
association with liver disease in the infants. Additionally,
the AMA positivity was transient, akin to the current
case report.
Transient AMA positivity in acute liver failure
In the patient herein illustrated, AMA became undetect￾able five years after the initial presentation. The decline
of AMA over time may be due to the effect of immuno￾suppressive treatment or may indeed reveal the transient
nature of the AMA positivity. A transient appearance of
AMA has been previously noted in North American
patients with acute liver failure (ALF). AMA have been
reported to be present in up to 40% of adult patients
with ALF and no other signs of PBC [32]. One study
examined 217 serum samples from 69 patients with
ALF, with samples collected over a 24-month period
[32]. Details as to how many patients were children were
not given. Initial testing showed that 40.6% of these
patients had AMA, with reactivity against the major
mitochondrial antigens (PDC-E2, BCOADC-E2, and
OGDC-E2) [32]. By 24 months, only one subject
remained positive for AMA directed against OGDC-E2
[32]. Similar data have been reported in the series of
ALF patients from King’s College Hospital in London
[24]. In that report, 13/47 (28%) sera from ALF patients
tested positive for AMA, using the highly sensitive and
specific MIT-3 (mitochondrial antigen 3) enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [24]. Of interest, these 13
cases tested negative for AMA using IIF, indicating that
the sensitivity for the detection of AMA largely depends
on the methodology used [24].
Unlike the reported cases of transient AMA, liver hist￾ology in this case showed biliary damage. In our experi￾ence, ALF in paediatric patients is not associated
with the presence of AMA. During a large-scale
autoimmune-screening program over a 7-year period,
only 2 out of 3808 Italian children with liver diseases
of a variety of causes tested positive for AMA.
In conclusion, we report a case of AIH-2 with PBC￾specific AMA positivity, documented both by IIF and
mitochondrial antigen-specific immunoassays. Investiga￾tion of this peculiar case may give insight into the
