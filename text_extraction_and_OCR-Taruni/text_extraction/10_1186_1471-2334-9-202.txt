Abstract
Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) can play an important role in polymicrobial infections.
They can have a direct pathogenic impact in causing the infection as well as an indirect effect
through their ability to produce the enzyme beta-lactamase. BLPB may not only survive penicillin
therapy but can also, as was demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo studies, protect other penicillin￾susceptible bacteria from penicillin by releasing the free enzyme into their environment. This
phenomenon occurs in upper respiratory tract, skin, soft tissue, surgical and other infections. The
clinical, in vitro, and in vivo evidence supporting the role of these organisms in the increased failure
rate of penicillin in eradication of these infections and the implication of that increased rate on the
management of infections is discussed.
Review
Penicillins have been the agents of choice for the therapy
of a variety of bacterial infections. However, within the
past sixty years, an increased resistance to these drugs has
been noted. In addition to bacteria long known to resist￾ant penicillin, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobac￾teriaceae, other previously susceptible organisms became
increasingly resistant due to several mechanisms includ￾ing the production of the enzyme beta-lactamase (BL).
These include aerobic and facultative bacteria such as Hae￾mophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as anaer￾obic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB, i.e. Bacteroides fragilis
group, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Prevotella
bivia, and Prevotella disiens) and Fusobacterium spp.) [1-3].
Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) may have an
important clinical role in infections. These organisms can
be pathogenic in causing the infection as well as have an
indirect effect through their ability to produce the enzyme
BL into their environment. BLPB may not only survive
penicillin therapy but also may protect other penicillin￾susceptible bacteria from penicillins by releasing the free
enzyme into their environment (Figure 1)[4].
In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated this phe￾nomenon. Animal studies demonstrated the ability of the
enzyme BL to influence polymicrobial infections. BL pro￾ducing of AGNB protected a penicillin-sensitive Fusobacte￾rium necrophorum [5] and Group A beta hemolytic
streptococci (GABHS) [6] from penicillin therapy in mice.
Clindamycin or the combination of penicillin and clavu￾lanate (a BL inhibitor), which are active against both
GABHS and AGNB, were effective in eradicating the infec￾tion [7]. An increase in resistance of GABHS to penicillin
was found when it was co-inoculated with S. aureus [8],
Haemophilus parainfluenzae [9], or B. fragilis [10].
Several studies demonstrate the activity of the enzyme BL
in polymicrobial infections. Penicillins were degraded by
purulent exudates obtained from abscesses [11,12] and in
experimental B. fragilis infection [13].
The presence of BL in clinical specimens was reported in
abscesses and mixed infections. These include abdominal
infections [12], empyema [14], cerebrospinal specimens
[15], abscesses [16], ear aspirates of acute and chronic ear
infections [17,18], and aspirates of acutely and chroni￾Published: 14 December 2009

cally inflamed maxillary sinuses. Many of these infections
had failed beta lactam therapies and required surgical
drainage to enhance cure [19].
The isolation of penicillin-susceptible bacteria mixed with
BLPB in patients who have failed to respond to penicillin
or cephalosporin therapy suggests the ability of BLPB to
protect a penicillin-susceptible or cephalosporin-suscepti￾ble organism from the activity of those drugs.
The emergence of oral BLPB was shown to be associated
with the administration of penicillin therapy [20]. The
selection of BLPB following antimicrobial therapy may
account for many of the clinical failures that occur after
penicillin therapy [21]. BLPB were recovered in 75 (40%)
of 185 children with orofacial and respiratory infections
who failed to respond to penicillin [22].
Aerobic and anaerobic BLPB may play a role in penicillin
failure to eradicate GABHS tonsillitis [8,9,21-31]. It is
plausible that these BLPB can protect GABHS from peni￾cillin by inactivation of the antibiotic. (Figure 1) BLPB
were recovered in 37 of 50 tonsils (74%) removed from
children who failed penicillin therapy. These observations
were confirmed by Reilly et al. [29], Chagollan et al. [30],
and Tuner and Nord [31]. Assays of the free enzyme in the
tissues demonstrated its presence in 33 of 39 (85%) ton￾sils that harbored BLPB [28].
BLPB emerged in the oropharynx promptly following
penicillin therapy [32-34]. BLPB were isolated in 3 of 21
(14%) of children prior to penicillin therapy, and in 10 of
21 (48%) following one course of penicillin [33]. In a
study of 26 children who were treated with penicillin for
seven days 11% harbored BLPB prior to the thearpy which
increased to 45% at the conclusion of the treatment, and
the incidence was 27% three months later [34]. These
organisms were also isolated from household contacts of
children repeatedly treated with penicillin, suggesting
their possible transfer within a family [33].
Chemoprophylaxis of 20 children with recurrent otitis
media with amoxicillin increased the recovery rate of
BLPB from 20% to 100% after six month [35]. No change
occurred in the recovery of BLPB in a group of 20 children
who received sulfisoxazole.
An association has been noted between the presence of
BLPB even prior to therapy of acute GABHS tonsillitis and
the outcome of 10-day oral penicillin therapy [36]. Of 98
children with acute GABHS tonsillitis, 36 failed to
respond to therapy. Prior to therapy, 18 isolates of BLPB
were detected in 16 (26%) of those cured and following
therapy 30 such organisms were recovered in 19 (31%) of
these children. In contrast, prior to therapy, 40 BLPB were
recovered from 25 (69%) of the children who failed, and
following therapy, 62 such organisms were found in 31
(86%) of the children in that group.
A high levels of BL in saliva reflects colonization with
many BLPB [37]. Previous antimicrobial therapy can
select for resistant bacterial strains that could persist in the
nasopharynx to re-emerge in new ear and sinus infection
[38].
The presence of BLPB in mixed infection warrants admin￾istration of drugs that will be effective in eradication of
BLPB as well as the other pathogens. The high failure rate
of penicillin therapy associated with the recovery of BLPB
in a growing number of cases of mixed aerobic-anaerobic
infections highlights the importance of this therapeutic
approach [21,22].
An infection in which this therapeutic approach has been
successful is recurrent tonsillitis [39-51]. Antimicrobials
active against aerobic and anaerobic BLPB as well as
GABHS were more effective in the eradication of this
infection and even prevented elective tonsillectomy [47]
compared to penicillin. These include lincomycin [39-
42], clindamycin [43-48], and amoxicillin/clavulanate
[52].
BLPB colonized over 83% of the adenoids in children
with chronic adeno-tonsillitis [53] which may explain the
persistence of many pathogens including Streptococcus
pneumoniae. The total number of potential pathogens and
BLPB were lower in those treated with amoxicillin/clavu￾lante or clindamycin [54,55] Similarly amoxicillin/clavu￾lante was superior to amoxicillin in achieving clinical cure
(92% vs 64%) and reducing the number of potential

nasopharyngeal pathogens including S. pneumoniae and
BLPB in children with acute otitis media [56].
Two studies illustrated the superiority of clindamycin to
penicillin in the treatment of lung abscesses [57,58]. This
was postulated to be due to its ability to eradicate the
anaerobic BLPB present in lung abscess.
Antimicrobials effective against anaerobic BLPB (ticarcil￾lin/clavulanate or clindamycin with ceftazidime) were
superior to an agent without such coverage (ceftriaxone)
in the therapy of aspiration or tracheostomy-associated
pneumonia in 57 children [59].
Conclusions
The above studies illustrate that the successful manage￾ment of polymicrobial infections is enhanced by directing
antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of both aerobic
and anaerobic BLPB. This approach is also useful in man￾agement infections such as tonsillitis where BLPB are part
of the normal flora at the infection site and is often
employed it the treatment of other infections at all body
sites. Some of these are polymicrobial where one of the
pathogens is a BLPB while in others the role of the BLPB
as a primary pathogen is unclear (i. e. tonsillitis).
Although beta lactam antibiotics are still the mainstay in
treatment of numerous infections, agents effective against
BLPB should be considered in the treatment of those who
failed these agents. Since BLPB can spread within the com￾munity as well as the hospital efforts should be made to
reduce the spread.33 However, further studies are war￾ranted to critically investigate these modalities.
