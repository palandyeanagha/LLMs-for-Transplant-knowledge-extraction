Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease that affects the intestinal tract via an inflam￾matory process. Patients who suffer from IBD often have diseases that affect multiple
other organ systems as well. These are called extraintestinal manifestations and can be
just as, if not more debilitating than the intestinal inflammation itself. The skin is one of
the most commonly affected organ systems in patients who suffer from IBD.The scientific
literature suggests that a disturbance of the equilibrium between host defense and toler￾ance, and the subsequent over-activity of certain immune pathways are responsible for the
cutaneous disorders seen so frequently in IBD patients. The purpose of this review article
is to give an overview of the types of skin diseases that are typically seen with IBD and their
respective pathogenesis, proposed mechanisms, and treatments. These cutaneous disor￾ders can manifest as metastatic lesions, reactive processes to the intestinal inflammation,
complications of IBD itself, or side effects from IBD treatments; these can be associated
with IBD via genetic linkage, common autoimmune processes, or other mechanisms that
will be discussed in this article. Ultimately, it is important for healthcare providers to under￾stand that skin manifestations should always be checked and evaluated for in patients with
IBD. Furthermore, skin disorders can predate gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may
serve as important clinical indicators leading physicians to earlier diagnosis of IBD.

INTRODUCTION
OVERVIEW
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic and inflamma￾tory disease of the intestinal tract. The two major types of IBD
are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). As the name
implies, UC is limited to the colon and/or rectum (normally con￾tinuous lesions in the rectum and colon), and affects only the
inner lining (mucosal and submucosal layers) of the gut. In con￾trast, CD can affect any part of the gut from mouth to anus as
non-continuous or skip lesions (a majority of cases start in the
terminal ileum), and affect the whole thickness (transmural) of
the bowel wall.
Up to 40% of IBD patients may be complicated by extraintesti￾nal manifestations (EIMs) and in some large series of studies, the
prevalence of EIMs is higher in CD compared to UC (Vind et al.,
2006;Vavricka et al., 2011). In a large cohort study of 950 patients,
EIMs were identified in 43% of 580 patients with CD and 31%
of 370 patients with UC (Vavricka et al., 2011). Multiple organ
systems and almost every organ system may be affected in IBD,
including the musculoskeletal system, skin, eyes, hepatobiliary
system, lungs, kidneys, immunologic or hematologic system, and
cardiovascular system (Williams et al., 2008;Vavricka et al., 2011).
The most common EIMs of IBD are peripheral arthritis, aphthous
stomatitis, uveitis, and erythema nodosum (EN; Vavricka et al.,
2011). Among the organ systems involved, the skin is one of the
most commonly affected organ systems. The most common skin
or mucocutaneous lesions associated with IBD are EN, pyoderma
gangrenosum (PG), and aphthous stomatitis (oral ulceration;
Rothfuss et al., 2006; Larsen et al., 2010). Aphthous stomatitis or
aphthae are the most common complication of the oral mucosa,
while fissure and fistulae are most common complication of the
perianal mucosa. EN and PG are immunoreactive in nature as a
result of the underlying IBD disease. In addition, skin lesions in
IBD patients can also be caused by nutritional deficiencies, such as
pellagra and cheilitis. Medication side effects, such as cushingoid
features from steroid usage or drug eruptions from immunosup￾pressant medications have also been noted. Other skin disorders
such psoriasis and vitiligo have also been associated with IBD
(Timani and Mutasim, 2008).
MECHANISMS BETWEEN IBD AND SKIN DISORDERS
Mucosal T-cells are important in maintaining intestinal home￾ostasis, defined as the balance between the mucosal epithelium,
intestinal microbes, and host immune response (van Wijk and
Cheroutre, 2010). Abnormal T-cell response to these microbial
antigens can disrupt this equilibrium and is believed to be the
mechanism that triggers the chronic inflammation and exces￾sive secretion of cytokines that lead to the development of IBD
(Izcue et al., 2009; van Wijk and Cheroutre, 2010; Monteleone
et al., 2011). It has been proposed that some EIM’s seen with
IBD manifest also as a result of immune dysregulation result￾ing in a lymphocyte mediated destructive process. Adams and
Eksteen (2006) proposed IBD patients with hepatic EIMs could be
explained by mucosal T-cells in the gut aberrantly traveling to the
liver, becoming exposed to hepatic antigens, and ultimately caus￾ing liver damage. This article suggested that a similar mechanism
could possibly explain the pathogenesis of other EIM’s (including
the skin) in patients with IBD (Adams and Eksteen, 2006).

Huang et al. IBD skin manifestations
Studies have implicated several immune pathways in cutaneous
disorders of IBD. In addition to the two established effector CD4
T-cells, the Th1 (cell-mediated) and Th2 (humoral), a third novel
T-helper cell has been described. Termed Th17 cells for its ability
to produce interleukin-17 (IL-17), these cells have been described
in various systemic, inflammatory, and autoimmune skin disor￾ders including psoriasis, contact or atopic dermatitis, scleroderma,
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Bechet’s disease, and IBD
(Asarch et al., 2008). This discovery brings to light new treatment
targets for dermatologic disorders in the IBD population.
Classically, CD has been considered to be mediated by Th1
pathways with elevated levels of IFN-γ and IL-12. On the other
hand, UC has been associated with Th2 mediated pathways with
elevated levels of IL-5 and IL-13 (van Wijk and Cheroutre, 2010).
However, recent evidence from mouse models challenges these
viewpoints and suggests that IL-23, induced by Th17 produced
cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22, which are present in both CD and
UC), is one of the major players in the pathogenesis of IBD (Hue
et al., 2006). This IL-23 and Th17 pathway has been proposed as a
common pathway of the development of IBD (both CD and UC)
and other autoimmune diseases as well (Ahern et al., 2008; van
Wijk and Cheroutre, 2010; Abraham and Medzhitov, 2011; Lees
et al., 2011). Most recently, high levels of expression of IL-23 was
reported in a difficult to treat PG lesion. Treatment with a mon￾oclonal antibody ustekinumab for 14 weeks resulted in marked
suppression of IL-23 expression and clinical resolution of the PG
lesion (Guenova et al., 2011).
CLASSIFICATION
The cutaneous manifestations of IBD have been classified into the
following categories according to pathogenesis (Table 1; Danese
et al., 2005; Trost and McDonnell, 2005; Passarini et al., 2007; Mnif
et al., 2010; Levine and Burakoff, 2011):
A. Specific cutaneous manifestations or granulomatous cuta￾neous lesions with the same histological features as the
underlying bowel disease.
B. Reactive cutaneous manifestation of IBD with immunologi￾cal mechanisms triggered by common antigens shared by gut
bacteria and skin.
C. Cutaneous disorders or dermatosis associated with IBD.
D. Secondary cutaneous manifestations either due to complica￾tions of IBD or adverse effects of IBD treatments.
CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS WITH SAME HISTOLOGICAL
FEATURES AS THE UNDERLYING IBD
CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS
Cutaneous or metastatic CD is a rare complication defined as the
occurrence of specific granulomatous cutaneous lesions with the
same histopathology (non-caseating granulomas with multinucle￾ated giant cells in the dermis surrounded by lymphocytes, plasma
cells, and eosinophils) as the intestinal lesions (Georgiou et al.,
2006). It occurs more frequently in adult females with established
intestinal CD (Georgiou et al., 2006). This disorder presents com￾monly as subcutaneous nodules or non-healing ulcers in the lower
extremities with rare localization to the genital (vulvar or testic￾ular) area; pseudocondyloma mimicking genital warts can also
occur (Georgiou et al., 2006; Larsen et al., 2010). Cutaneous CD
can be divided into two clinical forms: the genital form (56%)
which occurs more in children (characterized by edema, ery￾thema, fissures or ulcers of the labia, scrotum, or penis), and the
non-genital form (44%) which most commonly affects the lower
extremities (38%), abdomen and trunk (24%), upper extremi￾ties (15%), face and lips (11%), and intertriginous areas (8%;
Ploysangam et al., 1997). It seems unrelated to the activity of the
bowel disease or its response to the IBD treatment (Chalvardjian
and Nethercott, 1982; Lebwohl et al., 1984; Lestre et al., 2010).
Various treatment modalities have been tried, such as steroids
(topical, intralesional, or systemic), sulfasalazine, metronidazole,
azathioprine, methotrexate, hyperbaric oxygen, and anti-TNF-α
antibodies (Sarna et al., 2008; Lestre et al., 2010). In cases with
severe cutaneous ulcers unresponsive to medical treatment, sur￾gical resection under oral administration of zinc sulfate may be
indicated (Georgiou et al., 2006).
PERIANAL MANIFESTATIONS
Perianal CD including erythema, abscesses, ulcers, fissures, and fis￾tulas, occur in about 50% of CD patients at some point during their
clinical course (Danese et al., 2005). Perianal fissures and fistulas,
usually one of the most common skin lesions of IBD, occur mainly
in CD (20–60%) and rarely in UC (Roberts and Bunker, 1993; Leb￾wohl and Lebwohl, 1998). Perianal fissures and fistula are due to
direct involvement of skin and mucosa via a similar mechanism
as the bowel disease and may antedate the signs and symptoms of
bowel disease by several years (Figure 1; Ploysangam et al., 1997;
Lebwohl and Lebwohl, 1998). Fissures are usually painless and
located posteriorly, whereas fistulas manifest either as a cryptog￾landular infection or as a secondary complication of anal fissures.
Fistulas can be internal or entero-cutaneous and can undermine
ulcers and destroy the anal sphincter (Danese et al., 2005).
The recommended treatment of perianal fissures is topical
application of glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerine) ointment and in
some cases this is followed by Botox injections into the affected
anal sphincter area (Jonas and Scholefield,2001). In cases with only
limited response to these compounds, calcium channel antagonists
(diltiazem) or lateral internal sphincterotomy may be indicated
(Fleshner et al., 1995; Singh et al., 2009). For perianal fistulas,
combined medical and surgical therapies offer the best chance
for success (Lewis and Maron, 2010). Medical treatments include
antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin), immunosuppressants
(azathioprine, 6-MP, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus), and inflix￾imab (Safar and Sands, 2007; Lewis and Maron, 2010). Surgery
include fistulotomy for low fistulae (below the dentate line),
advance flap or fistula plug for high fistulae (above dentate line),
proctectomy with colostomy for severe perianal disease with rectal
involvement (Georgiou et al., 2006; Safar and Sands, 2007; Lewis
and Maron, 2010).
OROFACIAL MANIFESTATIONS
Orofacial CD may antedate the typical bowel symptoms by sev￾eral months to years. Its presentation and severity do not always
correlate with the activity of the underlying bowel disease. Orofa￾cial involvement occurs in 5–20% of CD patients and can present
as: aphthous stomatitis, pyostomatitis vegetans, angular cheilitis

and ulceration, mucosal nodularity (cobblestoning of the buccal
mucosa), nodules of gingival and alveolar mucosa, and indurated
fissuring of lower lips (Trost and McDonnell, 2005; Georgiou et
al., 2006). Biopsy of the lesions in CD patients, although rarely
required, can reveal non-caseating granulomas similar to bowel
lesions.
Aphthous stomatitis or ulcers, typically seen in the buccal
mucosa and lips, consist of oral ulcers and are more common in CD
(10%) than UC (4%;Vavricka et al., 2011). Minor aphthous ulcers
are small, shallow, round to oval shaped, have a grayish base, and
can be painful, but heal within 2 weeks without scarring (Figure 2).
On the other hand, major recurrent ulcers are larger, can last for
6 weeks, and frequently scar (Ship, 1996; Timani and Mutasim,
2008). A study showed that a majority of patients with multi￾ple aphthous ulcers had underlying IBD (Letsinger et al., 2005).
The pathogenesis of aphthous stomatitis and UC is still unclear.
Studies have not been successful in proving that these ulcers are
secondary to vitamin deficiencies as the lesions do not typically
improve with vitamin therapy (Basu and Asquith, 1980). Apht￾hous stomatitis occurs more often in active as opposed to inactive
IBD disease: 17.1 vs. 8.6% in CD, 4.1 vs. 3% in UC, but the latter
did not reach clinical significance (Vavricka et al., 2011). Other
studies suggest that recurrent aphthous stomatitis and symptom
onset often parallel UC disease activity (Timani and Mutasim,
2008). Treatment of aphthous stomatitis is symptomatic and con￾sists of topical anesthetics such as viscous xylocaine, steroid elixirs,
or topical steroids. Systemic steroids are used for severe or refrac￾tory cases (Basu and Asquith, 1980; Trost and McDonnell, 2005;
Timani and Mutasim, 2008; Levine and Burakoff, 2011). For sec￾ondary bacterial superinfections, topical antibiotics can be used
although they are rarely required (Levine and Burakoff, 2011).
For orofacial CD, the treatment should be directed at the local
lesion and underlying systemic disease. For more severe or refrac￾tory orofacial CD, treatment should include systemic steroids,
immunomodulators, and anti-TNF-α therapy (Quezada et al.,
2009).

REACTIVE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF IBD
ERYTHEMA NODOSUM
Erythema nodosum, the most common cutaneous manifestation
of IBD, affects about 3–10% of UC and 4–15% of CD patients
(Lebwohl and Lebwohl, 1998; Georgiou et al., 2006; Timani and
Mutasim, 2008; Vavricka et al., 2011). Among patients with IBD,
EN has been found to affect 1.9% of females compared to 0.7% of
males (Turkcapar et al., 2006). A prospective study of 50 patients
FIGURE 1 | Perianal fissure in a patient with IBD. Note the longitudinal
tear pattern in the anoderm.
with EN found that only 4% were eventually diagnosed with IBD
showing that EN rarely precedes the initial diagnosis of IBD (Mert
et al., 2004; Trost and McDonnell, 2005; Weinstein et al., 2005).
EN is often associated with systemic symptoms of fevers, chills,
arthralgias, or arthritis. Arthralgias and arthritis are rare in chil￾dren, but in adults they can antedate the occurrence of EN lesions
by weeks to months (Lebwohl and Lebwohl, 1998; Berkowitz and
Lebwohl, 2000). Typical EN lesions present as painful, tender,
warm nodules (1–5 cm in diameter), and raised bluish-red sub￾cutaneous lesions or plaques located on the extensor surfaces of
extremities, predominantly on the anterior surface of the lower
extremities (Figure 3; Mir-Madjlessi et al., 1985; Evans and Pardi,
2007; Timani and Mutasim, 2008;Vavricka et al., 2011). These skin
nodules are non-ulcerating, palpable, and can resemble a bruise
on the skin, but are not always easily visible (Timani and Mutasim,
2008; Levine and Burakoff, 2011). EN can occur in multiple loca￾tions simultaneously and recurrence rate is approximately 20%
(Freeman, 2005).
Biopsy is generally not necessary as the diagnosis of EN may
be confirmed based on the clinical presentation (Agrawal et al.,
2007). The histology of EN shows lympho-histocytic infiltrate of
lower dermis and focal panniculitis (Danese et al., 2005; Larsen
et al., 2010). Panniculitis is inflammation of the subcutaneous fat
and thus EN can occur wherever subcutaneous fat is present. The
most common site is the pretibial or shin area, but the knees,
ankles, arms, or trunk can also be affected (Levine and Burakoff,
2011). Direct immunofluorescence of EN lesions reveal perivas￾cular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement, suggesting
that the pathogenesis of reactive cutaneous manifestation of IBD is
due to the abnormal immunological response of common antigens
between bowel bacteria and skin (Veloso, 1990; Fava and Danese,
FIGURE 2 | Aphthous stomatitis of the oral mucosa. Note the erythematous ring around the yellow to gray colored ulceration in this minor aphthous
stomatitis.

appearance.
2011; Khor et al., 2011). EN lesions have been noted to be corre￾lated with the underlying disease activity and worsened with colitis
flares (Timani andMutasim,2008). Typically, the time between UC
diagnosis and appearance of EN is about 5 years (Mir-Madjlessi
et al., 1985). EN in CD patients is mostly associated with colonic
involvement (Georgiou et al., 2006).
Since EN lesions mirror bowel disease activity and flare up,
treatments targeting underlying IBD disease and flare up always
leads to the remission of the cutaneous lesion (Orchard, 2003).
However, in situations where lesions occur during the quies￾cent phase, low doses of oral steroids can lead to rapid remis￾sion of the cutaneous lesions in most cases (Georgiou et al.,
2006). Other effective alternatives include NSAIDs, potassium
iodide, colchicine, dapsone, and immunosuppressants, such as
cyclosporine, thalidomide, etc. In recalcitrant cases, infliximab has
been used with successful results (Kaufman et al., 2005). In gen￾eral, EN patients have a shorter time to remission (approximately
5 weeks) than do PG patients (Tromm et al., 2001; Timani and
Mutasim, 2008).
PYODERMA GANGRENOSUM
After EN (3–8%), PG represents the second most common cuta￾neous manifestation of IBD (1–3%), but PG is also the most severe
and debilitating (Danese et al., 2005; Georgiou et al., 2006). PG is
more common in UC (5–12%) than CD (1–2%) and like EN, some
studies have shown a female predilection (Bernstein et al., 2001;
Trost and McDonnell, 2005). PG was first described in 1930 by
Brunsting as necrotic ulcers containing purulent material (usually
sterile on culture) with expanding borders of erythema (Newell
and Malkinson, 1982). The non-infectious pustules and nodules
eventually expand outward and develop into painful deep ulcers
with undermined wound edges (Callen, 1998; Farhi and Wallach,
2008). The ulcer has sharply circumscribed and demarcated bor￾ders with a necrotic yellowish base. The ulcers can be single or
multiple, unilateral or bilateral, and can range in size from sev￾eral centimeters to the surface of an entire limb. Other than
the classical ulcerative form, PG may also occur in three other
forms: the pustular form (multiple painful pustules with halo),
bullous form (bullae which rapidly transform into painful ero￾sions and necrotic ulcers), and vegetans form (well-demarcated
shallow ulcer, which then gradually transform into an exophytic
lesion; Georgiou et al., 2006). PG usually occurs on the extensor
surface of the legs, but can appear anywhere on the skin, most
noticeably on the abdominal wall adjacent to a postsurgical stoma
(Lebwohl and Lebwohl, 1998). Peristomal PG lesions occur from
2 weeks to 3 years after ostomy creation and they typically rapidly
evolve from small, erythematous pustules to deep ulcers within
hours to days (Cairns et al., 1994). Pathergy, the proposed mech￾anism behind this occurrence, is characterized by an exaggerated
physiological response of skin lesions that develops secondary to
local trauma and has been reported in approximately 30% of cases
of PG (Callen, 1998; Blitz and Rudikoff, 2001; Ardizzone et al.,
2008). The type of trauma can range from postsurgical wounds to
minor injuries as non-traumatic as needle sticks from venipunc￾ture (Levine and Burakoff, 2011). This is the reason that PG is
worsened with debridement and occurs more often on the leg,
around stomas, or around skin biopsy sites (Figure 4). In CD
patients, PG is often associated with colonic involvement and is
usually diagnosed approximately 10 years after the initial diag￾nosis of UC (Mir-Madjlessi et al., 1985). Compared to EN, PG
often takes a more prolonged course and approximately 35% of
patients will experience relapse of PG (Rothfuss et al., 2006). Diag￾nosis of PG is usually clinical, but skin biopsy may be necessary
for confirmation. PG is classified as a type of neutrophilic der￾matosis in which the inflammatory infiltrate seen on microscopic
examination shows dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrates without
any evidence of infection, which was described by some as sterile
abscesses (Nischal and Khopkar, 2007; Timani and Mutasim, 2008;
Cohen, 2009; Larsen et al., 2010).
The pathogenesis of PG in IBD is proposed to be an abnormal
immune response with cross-reacting autoantibodies directed at
common antigens in the bowel and skin (Crowson et al., 2003;
Feliciani et al., 2009). It is classified as one of the neutrophilic
dermatosis. Other factors such as neutrophil dysfunction, abnor￾mal T-cell response, and over-expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as IL-8, IL-16, IL-17, and TNF-α have also been
proposed as mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PG (Feliciani et al.,
2009; Marzano et al., 2010). A case report has implicated the IL-23
and TH17 axis as being responsible for a PG lesion that subse￾quently resolved with a monoclonal antibody targeted at inhibiting
IL-23 expression (Guenova et al., 2011).
While EN usually correlates with IBD activity, PG correlation
with IBD activity is controversial as there are much fewer PG
cases. In a study of 14 patients with UC, there was no temporal

PG lesions (Thornton et al., 1980). In a study of 34 IBD patients,
PG was diagnosed in 50% of UC and 75% of CD when underlying
bowel disease was active (Levitt et al., 1991). In a study of 986
patients hospitalized for IBD, six patients (0.6%) had PG (Men￾achem and Gotsman, 2004). Of these six patients, PG appeared
6.5 years on average after the diagnosis of IBD. The majority of
patients had active colitis at the onset of PG and half of these
patients experienced other associated EIMs, including sacroili￾itis, peripheral arthritis, and EN. However, PG does not always
respond to treatment of underlying bowel disease and response
to bowel resection is unpredictable (Levitt et al., 1991; Menachem
and Gotsman, 2004). Further studies need to be done to investi￾gate the relationship between the onset of PG and the underlying
IBD activity.
When compared to EN, PG lesions tend to be more severe
and resistant to therapy thus necessitating more aggressive ther￾apy. Furthermore, PG patients appear to benefit less than EN
patients from colectomy (Goudet et al., 2001). In fact, about 30%
of patients with PG do not experience improvement of their lesions
with treatment of the underlying IBD (Mir-Madjlessi et al., 1985).
In general, treatment of PG includes a combination of wound
care, topical medications, antibiotics for secondary infections, and
treatment targeted at the underlying colitis (Danese et al., 2005).
Although no individual therapy is universally effective, treatment
of PG usually involves a regimen of systemic, cutaneous, and/or
intralesional medications (Timani and Mutasim, 2008; Cohen,
2009).
Local wound care includes sterile saline lavages, topical antibac￾terial creams, and hydrocolloid dressings. Topical treatments,
such as highly potent steroids with occlusive dressings, nicotine,
benzoyl peroxide, sodium cromoglycate, hydrogen peroxide, 5-
aminosalicylic acid, and tacrolimus have shown varying success
rates (Trost and McDonnell, 2005; Georgiou et al., 2006; Callen
and Jackson, 2007). Although intralesional steroid injections can
be effective in small or localized disease, the mainstay of treatment
remains systemic steroids especially for multiple lesions or gener￾alized form of PG (Georgiou et al., 2006; Timani and Mutasim,
2008). Systemic steroid therapy typically compromises of high
dose of oral prednisone around 40–120 mg/day for the average
adult initially until lesional clearance, followed by a low mainte￾nance dose that is used to maintain remission (Crowson et al.,
2003). However, many alternatives exist. Assuming no concurrent
infection, mainstay therapy includes systemic corticosteroids at
dosages from 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day and cyclosporine at initial dosages
of 2–5 mg/kg/day (Wollina, 2002; Timani and Mutasim, 2008).
Keeping the goal trough serum levels of cyclosporine between
150 and 350 ng/ml has been shown to have good outcomes on
PG healing (Curley et al., 1985; Matis et al., 1992; Cohen, 2009;
Turner et al., 2010). Other agents including minocycline, sul￾fasalazine, azathioprine, dapsone, potassium iodide, intravenous
immunoglobulin, intravenous steroids, mycophenolate mofetil,
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, plasmapheresis, and hyperbaric
oxygen treatment have been employed with various success rates
(Wasserteil et al., 1992; Georgiou et al., 2006; Tutrone et al., 2007;
Timani and Mutasim, 2008; Cohen, 2009). Anti-TNF-α agents
including etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab have also been
reported to treat PG lesions effectively and are used in refractory
cases of PG (McGowan et al., 2004; Brooklyn et al., 2006; Alkhouri
et al., 2009).
When treating peristomal PG lesions, about two-thirds (12/17)
of patients respond to systemic high dose steroids and local wound
care, while the rest require additional therapy or long-term med￾ical management. A study showed that no patients were success￾fully treated with stomal revision (Cairns et al., 1994). To avoid
pathergy, unnecessary surgical interventions should be avoided.
However, surgery can be considered if medical therapies are not
successful. Proper timing of the surgery to avoid active phase of
the disease and appropriate administration of immunosuppres￾sants are essential for optimal long-term wound stabilization or
remission (Wollina, 2002; Trost and McDonnell, 2005; Wittekindt
et al., 2007). For patients with extensive colitis and severe refrac￾tory PG lesions unresponsive to medical therapy, proctocolectomy
may be considered, but PG has been reported to relapse years after
proctocolectomy (Read, 1985; Levitt et al., 1991).
PYODERMATITIS VEGETANS, PYOSTOMATITIS VEGETANS,
PYODERMATITIS–PYOSTOMATITIS VEGETANS
Pyodermatitis vegetans (PDV), a rare skin manifestation of IBD
and often regarded as one of clinical forms of PG, has histopathol￾ogy similar to pyostomatitis vegetans (discussed below) but with
treatment similar to PG (Georgiou et al., 2006). PDV occurs
mainly in skin folds such as axillary or inguinal area, but can
also be present on the trunk or extremities. These lesions are
www.frontiersin.org February 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 13 | 7

Huang et al. IBD skin manifestations
characterized by pustules that quickly rupture, forming erosions
with hemorrhagic ground, developing large raised (vegetating)
well-demarcated plaques with surrounding pustules (Georgiou et
al., 2006; Canpolat et al., 2011).
Pyostomatitis vegetans (PSV), a rare disorder of the oral
mucosa that is considered as the oral equivalent of PDV on cutis,
is relatively specific for IBD, particularly UC (Storwick et al., 1994;
Timani and Mutasim, 2008; Femiano et al., 2009). In contrast to
EN and PG which have been shown to have a female predilection,
there is a male predominance in PSV with a ratio ranging from
2:1 to 3:1 and the majority of cases occur in Caucasians (Femiano
et al., 2009; Ficarra et al., 2010). The pathogenesis of PSV is not
known yet, although abnormal immunological responses and/or
microbial factors are suggested (Kethu, 2006; Femiano et al., 2009;
Ficarra et al., 2010). Lesions are erythematous, thickened, and
hyperplastic folds of the buccal and labial mucosa with multi￾ple gray to yellow pustules, which progress to erosions forming
shallow, folded, and fissured “snail tract” ulcers, due to degenera￾tion, ulceration, and suppuration of vegetating pustules (Femiano
et al., 2009). They often manifest before the diagnosis of IBD
(Hansen et al., 1983; Femiano et al., 2009). Lesions also occur
at labial attached gingiva, soft and hard palate, oral vestibule, and
tonsillar regions. They usually spare the tongue and floor of the
mouth (Femiano et al., 2009). Symptoms of burning and pain may
be present (Ficarra et al., 2010). Other than oral cavity, mucosal
membranes at the vaginal, nasal, and rarely periocular areas can
also be affected (Femiano et al., 2009). Peripheral eosinophilia has
been found in most cases reported and maybe a valuable aid for
the diagnosis of PV (Femiano et al., 2009). Histopathologically,
PSV is characterized by epithelial acanthosis and superficial ulcer￾ation with intraepithelial and/or subepithelial micro abscesses
containing numerous eosinophils and neutrophils with underly￾ing connective tissues containing dense lymphocytic and plasma
cell infiltrate (Femiano et al., 2009; Ficarra et al., 2010).
Pyodermatitis vegetans was first reported by Hallopeau (1898)
when he described two patients with unusual pustular dermatosis
and oral lesions for which he named pyodermite vegetans (Hallo￾peau, 1898). McCarthy (1949) proposed the term “pyostomatitis
vegetans” after he observed similar lesions isolated in the oral cav￾ity (McCarthy, 1949; Femiano et al., 2009). Recently these two
entities are considered to be variants of the same disease termed
pyodermatitis–pyostomatitis vegetans (PPV; Ficarra et al., 2010).
PDV and PSV (or together as a group PPV) are rare cutaneous
manifestation of IBD (Storwick et al., 1994; Femiano et al., 2009).
In general, bowel disease antedate oral involvement by several years
(Leibovitch et al., 2005). The rash of PPV has been reported to cor￾relate with underlying bowel disease activity (Ayangco et al., 2002;
Kitayama et al., 2010). The pathogenesis of PSV, PDV, or PPV is
not clear, but has been hypothesized to be due to aberrant immune
responses in IBD to cross-reacting antigens in the skin and bowel
resulting in mucocutaneous manifestations (Femiano et al., 2009).
Employing immunosuppressants and systemic steroids to treat
PSV has variable efficacy for treating symptoms and maintaining
remission (Timani and Mutasim, 2008). Local therapies includ￾ing hydrogen peroxide, topical steroids, and antibacterial mouth￾washes are usually not effective in controlling disease activity. A
case report demonstrated successful PSV remission with topical
fluocinonide gel, but the patient relapsed and ultimately required
total colectomy to achieve and maintain remission (Calobrisi et al.,
1995; Femiano et al., 2009). In fact, subtotal colectomy in a patient
with UC resulted in the development of PPV and relapse of bowel
disease 5 years after surgery (Kitayama et al., 2010).
NEUTROPHILIC DERMATOSES
Neutrophilic dermatoses include Sweet’s syndrome (SS) and
bowel-associated dermatosis–arthritis syndrome (BADAS). SS,
first described by R. D. Sweet and named after him, is character￾ized by the abrupt onset of tender and red to purple inflammatory
nodules or papules that coalesce to form plaques, affecting the
upper limbs, face, or neck. In addition to painful and edema￾tous nodules and plaques, vesicles, bullae, or pustules may also
be present (Georgiou et al., 2006; Nischal and Khopkar, 2007).
Patients with colonic disease and females between the ages of 30
and 50 have increased risk for developing SS (Ardizzone et al.,
2008; Timani and Mutasim, 2008). SS is also known as acute neu￾trophilic dermatosis as it is typically accompanied by fever and
peripheral neutrophilia with >70% neutrophils while cutaneous
lesions usually show dense aseptic neutrophilic infiltration (Geor￾giou et al., 2006). These lesions are tender and non-pruritic in
nature, but can be difficult to distinguish from EN when they affect
the lower extremities (Guhl and Garcia-Diez, 2008). Skin biopsy,
which shows neutrophilic infiltrates in the reticular dermis, can be
helpful in reaching a diagnosis when there is doubt (Kemmett and
Hunter, 1990; Georgiou et al., 2006; Timani and Mutasim, 2008;
Cohen, 2009). Patients may also experience fatigue, headache, and
other non-specific constitutional symptoms. SS can affect extra￾cutaneous organ systems including, but are not limited to the
musculoskeletal, ocular, hepatic, pulmonary, and renal systems
(Cohen et al., 1988).
Although the pathogenesis is unclear, SS usually develops as a
reactive response to some type of underlying systemic disease, such
as infection, malignancy, medications, or IBD (Vij et al., 2010). In
fact, studies have shown that patients with SS have some type of
underlying systemic disease in 50% of cases and an underlying
malignancy in 20% of cases (Kemmett and Hunter, 1990; Souissi
et al., 2007). UC and CD are the most common systemic diseases
associated with SS (Timani and Mutasim, 2008). SS is associated
with active bowel disease (67–80%; Georgiou et al., 2006; Ardiz￾zone et al., 2008). The onset of symptoms from SS usually occur
after the initial diagnosis of IBD, but may antedate the onset of
IBD (21%) and has also been reported to occur 3 months after
proctocolectomy in patients with UC (Darvay, 1996; Ardizzone
et al., 2008). Similar to other reactive manifestations of IBD, the
pathogenesis of SS has been hypothesized to be related to an altered
immune response to common antigens in the skin and gut bac￾teria (Ali and Duerksen, 2008). Furthermore, ANCA and G-CSF
or other cytokines have been proposed to play a pathogenetic role
in activation, maturation, and chemotaxis of neutrophils in SS
(Diaz-Peromingo et al., 2001; Cohen and Kurzrock, 2003).
First line treatment of SS involves systemic steroids and studies
have shown marked symptom improvement with a 6 week steroid
course (Cohen et al., 1988; Souissi et al., 2007). When dealing with
localized disease, topical, or intralesional steroids are sometimes
used with good effects (Timani and Mutasim, 2008). However,
Frontiers in Physiology | Gastrointestinal Sciences February 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 13 | 8

Huang et al. IBD skin manifestations
recurrence of SS is relatively common with as many as 1/3 of
patients re-experiencing symptoms despite treatment (Kemmett
and Hunter, 1990). Skin lesions that have not been treated have
been documented to heal on their own, but can leave behind
scars (Kemmett and Hunter, 1990; Timani and Mutasim, 2008).
Other first line options for treatment include colchicine and potas￾sium iodide. Other agents such as indomethacin and clofazimine
can be used if first line agents are ineffective or cannot be toler￾ated. (Cohen and Kurzrock, 2002; Cohen, 2009). Treatments with
immunosuppressants and anti-TNF-α have been reported to be
successful in SS (Ali and Duerksen, 2008; Cohen, 2009; Larsen
et al., 2010).
The BADAS, previously named as bowel bypass syndrome as
it was originally reported to occur in up to 20% of patients after
laparoscopic jejuno-ileal bypass surgery for obesity, can occur as a
complication after various intestinal surgeries, in patients with
diverticulitis or appendicitis, and in patients with IBD (Geor￾giou et al., 2006; Ashok and Kiely, 2007; Patton et al., 2009; Tu
et al., 2011). The clinical characteristics of BADAS syndrome are
recurrent episodes of fever, malaise, abdominal pain, arthritis,
and polyarthralgias of the upper extremities involving the asym￾metric large joints and interphalangeal joints of the fingers with
accompanying tenosynovitis, and by the appearance of character￾istic cutaneous lesions (Ashok and Kiely, 2007). These cutaneous
lesions consist of erythematous macules (3–10 mm in diameter),
developing into edematous and painful papules with central asep￾tic vesicles or pustules (2–4 mm in diameter) over the subsequent
1–2 days, which are located on the upper chest and arms (usually
on the deltoid muscle region) and EN-like lesions in the legs. These
maculopapular rashes occur in crops, resolve within 1–2 weeks
without leaving scars and can recur every 1–6 weeks. These cuta￾neous lesions are temporally dependent on IBD activity (Ashok
and Kiely, 2007; Patton et al., 2009).
The histology of BADAS is characterized by perivascular neu￾trophilic, mononuclear, and eosinophilic (depending on the stage
of the lesions) infiltrate with dermal edema, intraepidermal pus￾tules, minimal alterations of the walls of capillaries and venules
without the features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis or fibrinoid
necrosis (Georgiou et al., 2006; Nischal and Khopkar, 2007). Sim￾ilar to PG and SS, BADAS has been classified in the spectrum
of aseptic neutrophilic dermatoses with histopathology showing
dense neutrophil infiltration and no destruction of vessel walls
(Nischal and Khopkar, 2007; Patton et al., 2009). By immuno￾fluorescence staining, the deposition of immunoglobulins and
complement has frequently been observed at the dermo-epidermal
junction. The pathogenesis of BADAS is hypothesized to be due to
immune complex-mediated vessel damage, followed by increased
migration and accumulation of neutrophils in the perivascular
area (Jorizzo et al., 1984). The circulating immune complexes
are believed to form due to an immunological response against
antigenic bacterial peptidoglycans in the gut, with subsequent
deposition in the skin and joints (Jorizzo et al., 1984; Nischal and
Khopkar, 2007; Patton et al., 2009). It is theorized that overgrowth
of bacteria, such as seen in active IBD, diverticulitis, appendici￾tis, blind loop after bypass surgery, or in the inflamed bowel
segment after surgery, result in inflammation, and the forma￾tion of abnormal immunological responses to bacterial antigens
especially peptidoglycans (Georgiou et al., 2006; Patton et al.,
2009). Similar pathophysiology is also thought to involve the cuta￾neous manifestations of EN, PG, and SS (Georgiou et al., 2006;
Nischal and Khopkar, 2007).
The management of the BADAS includes the treatment of
the underlying bowel disorder and the administration of sys￾temic steroids and antibiotics for inhibition of bacterial over￾growth (tetracycline, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin), although the
response to these antibiotics are inconsistent (Georgiou et al.,2006;
Patton et al., 2009). NSAIDs may be used to alleviate arthralgias or
arthritis, but the potential toxicity of NSAIDs on IBD should make
the decision to use NSAIDs based on weighing the risk-benefit
ratio for each individual patient (Singh et al., 2009). Other drugs
such as colchicine, dapsone, and sulfasalazine have been tried with
variable successful rates (Georgiou et al., 2006).
LEUKOCYTOCLASTIC VASCULITIS
Leukocytoclastic vasculitis, one of the rare cutaneous manifes￾tation of IBD, is characterized histopathologically by neutrophil
infiltration and nuclear debris of inflamed postcapillary venules
with endothelial enlargement and fibrinoid necrosis (Akbulut
et al., 2008). The skin presentation ranges from palpable purpura
(mediated by deposition of immune complexes in postcapillary
venules) on the lower extremities and ankles to necrotic ulcers
(Tsiamoulos et al., 2008). Similar to other reactive cutaneous man￾ifestations of IBD, the pathogenesis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis
with histology showing hypersensitivity vasculitis of small vessels
is proposed to be circulating immune complexes (Mackel and Jor￾don, 1982; Iannone et al., 2003; Akbulut et al., 2008; Tsiamoulos
et al., 2008). In CD, leukocytoclastic vasculitis occurs not only
during the onset of bowel disease, but also during periods of exac￾erbation. On the other hand, in UC, leukocytoclastic vasculitis
most commonly precede the onset of bowel disease with a lag￾ging period ranging from 1 month to 2 years (Iannone et al., 2003;
Akbulut et al., 2008; Tsiamoulos et al., 2008). In most cases of
leukocytoclastic vasculitis, treating the underlying IBD results in
resolution of the lesions (Akbulut et al., 2008; Tsiamoulos et al.,
2008).
CUTANEOUS DISORDERS OR DERMATOSIS ASSOCIATED
WITH IBD
These disorders include hidradenitis suppurativa, phlebitis, ery￾thema multiforme, urticaria, lichen planus, secondary amyloido￾sis, and various autoimmune skin disorders, such as acquired
epidermolysis bullosa (blistering lesions of the knees, elbows,
hands, and feet), bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous der￾matosis, vitiligo, and psoriasis (Georgiou et al., 2006; Levine and
Burakoff, 2011). Rarely has IBD been reported to be associated
with skin neoplasm such as Bowen’s disease and squamous cell
carcinoma, which require surgical excision (Georgiou et al., 2006).
Acquired epidermolysis bullosa or epidermolysis bullosa
acquisita (EBA) is characterized by autoantibodies to type VII
collagen (detected in both the skin and colon of normal individ￾uals), which was also detected in 13/19 CD and 4/31 UC patients
(Chen et al., 2002; Hoffmann and Kruis, 2004). In fact, EBA has
been reported to be most frequently (25%) associated with CD
(Hoffmann and Kruis, 2004). This finding suggests that chronic
www.frontiersin.org February 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 13 | 9

Huang et al. IBD skin manifestations
inflammation in the intestine predisposed IBD patients to develop
autoantibodies against type VII collagen in the gut, which in turn
attacks the skin at the dermal–epidermal junction resulting in
the blistering skin lesions seen in EBA (Hundorfean et al., 2010).
Future research is needed to provide more insight in this hypoth￾esis. Compared to an incidence of 0.3% of vitiligo in the normal
population, the incidence of vitiligo is higher in CD (0.5%) and
UC (1.1%; Pashankar et al., 1999). The pathogenesis of vitiligo in
IBD has been proposed to be autoimmune or genetic HLA linkage
in nature (Pashankar et al., 1999; Quan et al., 2010). Secondary
amyloidosis is rare in IBD and occurs as a systemic response to
chronic inflammation. The systemic amyloidosis in IBD is type
AA amyloidosis and is more common in CD (0.9%) than UC
(0.07%) most likely as a result of a higher degree of inflammation
in CD (Sattianayagam et al., 2009).
The most frequently associated cutaneous disease is psoriasis
which occurs in 7–11% of the IBD population compared to 1–2%
of general population (Danese et al., 2005). In one study, psoriasis
was found to be more prevalent in CD (11.2%) than UC (5.7%;
Yates et al., 1982;Vavricka et al., 2011). The association of IBD with
psoriasis is believed to be both genetically and immunologically
related (Georgiou et al., 2006). In a recent study of 146 patients
with both IBD and psoriasis compared to a control of 146 patients
with only psoriasis, it was found that patients with both IBD and
psoriasis had significantly higher rates of autoimmune thyroidi￾tis (6.8 vs.2.1%), hepatitis (6.2 vs. 0.7%), and diabetes (26.7 vs.
11.0%; Binus et al., 2011). Individuals with both IBD and psoriasis
also had significantly higher CRPs, ESRs, and sero-negative arthri￾tis (41.1%) compared to individuals with only psoriasis. Certain
gene loci on chromosomes 3, 4, 6, and 16 are associated with both
CD and psoriasis (Georgiou et al., 2006). A recent study showed
that a striking overlap of loci between diseases of CD, UC, pso￾riasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis
(Cho and Brant, 2011). These studies suggest that genetic predis￾positions or HLA linkages for certain specific immune response
patterns and common inflammatory pathways may play an impor￾tant role in the association of these diseases (Georgiou et al., 2006;
Binus et al., 2011).
SECONDARY CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS DUE TO
COMPLICATIONS OF IBD OR ITS TREATMENTS
MANIFESTATIONS SECONDARY TO MALNUTRITION AND
MALABSORPTION
Skin manifestations of IBD secondary to malnutrition and/or mal￾absorption include the acquired form of acrodermatitis entero￾pathica (zinc deficiency), pellagra (niacin deficiency), scurvy (vit￾amin C deficiency), purpura (vitamin C and K deficiency), stom￾atitis/glossitis/angular cheilitis (vitamin B deficiency), xeroderma,
or dry skin and unspecified eczema (essential fatty acid defi￾ciency), hair and nail abnormalities (malabsorption of amino acid
and protein; Trost and McDonnell, 2005; Georgiou et al., 2006;
O’Sullivan and O’Morain, 2006). The acquired form of acroder￾matitis enteropathica, due to zinc deficiency, is the most common
nutritional-deficient cutaneous manifestation of IBD and more
common in CD than UC (Dronfield et al., 1977; McClain et al.,
1980; Danese et al., 2005). The skin lesions present as psoriasis
involving an erythematous patch and plaque, which may evolve
into crusted vesicles, bullae, or pustules. The lesions occur fre￾quently around the mouth, anus, limbs, fingers, and scalp (Danese
et al., 2005; von Felbert and Hunziker, 2010). Adequate supple￾mentation of the deficient nutrients or vitamins is the treatment
of choice. For example, acrodermatitis enteropathica is treated
with zinc sulfate 220 mg/day (Danese et al., 2005; Georgiou et al.,
2006).
SECONDARY CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS DUE TO ADVERSE
EFFECTS OF IBD TREATMENT
Skin manifestations from adverse effects can result in a broad range
of secondary cutaneous manifestations, such as drug eruptions,
urticaria, angioedema, hair loss, lichen planus, erythema multi￾forme, bullous dermatosis/reaction, Stevens–Johnson syndrome,
acne, psoriasis and so on (Georgiou et al., 2006; Fiorino et al.,
2009). The following are examples of drugs used in IBD treat￾ments that can cause secondary cutaneous complications: 5-ASA,
metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, azathioprine, 6-MP, methotrexate,
cyclosporine, steroids, anti-TNF-α agents, etc. (Georgiou et al.,
2006; Passarini et al., 2007).
Anti-TNF-α agents have been used successfully in the treatment
of IBD and psoriasis, but when treating IBD, anti-TNF-α agents
such as infliximab and adalimumab can paradoxically induce pso￾riasis lesions after the third or fourth infusion (Passarini et al.,
2007; Fiorino et al., 2009). The psoriasis lesions regressed after
withdrawing the anti-TNF-α agents in 16 out of 17 patients (Fior￾ino et al., 2009). Although there have only been 18 reported cases
of anti-TNF α induced psoriasis in the IBD population, but clin￾icians should still be aware of this potential side effect (Fiorino
et al., 2009). It has been suggested that inhibition of TNF-α induces
over-expression of cutaneous IFN-α which then causes predispo￾sition to psoriasis (Iborra et al., 2011). The treatment of psoriasis
induced by anti-TNF-α agents is cessation of the offending agents
and topical steroid therapy (Iborra et al., 2011).
CONCLUSION
The most common cutaneous manifestations of IBD are EN and
PG (Levine and Burakoff, 2011). All IBD patients should be closely
examined for skin manifestations as some skin lesions may be
related to IBD activity. Manifestation of one EIM increases the
risk of developing additional EIMs, and all EIMs affect both mor￾bidity and mortality in IBD (Monsen et al., 1990; Das, 1999;
Vavricka et al., 2011). Similar to other EIMs of IBD, skin lesions
may postdate, occur with, or antedate the onset of the underlying
disease process (Apgar, 1991). Since dermatological manifesta￾tions can precede bowel disease or bowel exacerbation, idiopathic
skin lesions such as EN, PG, recurrent multiple aphthous stom￾atitis, or PPV should alert clinicians to evaluate the possibility
of underlying IBD so that early diagnosis and intervention with
the appropriate therapy can be initiated (Levine and Burakoff,
2011).
