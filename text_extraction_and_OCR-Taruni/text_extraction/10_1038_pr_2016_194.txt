The management of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) 
has changed substantially over the past four decades. In the 
1970s, children with HLHS could only be provided with sup￾portive care. As a result, most of these unfortunate children 
died within the neonatal period. The advent of the Norwood 
procedure in the early 1980s has changed the prognosis for 
these children, and the majority now undergoing a series of 
three surgical stages that can support survival beyond the neo￾natal period and into early adulthood. This review will focus on 
the Norwood procedure and the other important innovations 
of the last half century that have improved our outlook toward 
children born with HLHS.
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is defined as under￾development of the structures of the left side of the heart, 
which includes the mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and 
aortic arch. HLHS occurs 0.16–0.36 per 1,000 live births and 
comprises 1.4–3.8% of congenital heart disease. Despite the rel￾atively low incidence, it is responsible for 23% of cardiac deaths 
occurring in the first week of life (1,2). Prior to the 1980s, there 
were no viable surgical options for these infants. Rather, these 
infants were provided supportive care and comfort measures, 
and most died shortly after birth. Fortunately, as a result of sur￾gical and medical advances of the last four decades, many of 
these children now undergo a series of three operations that 
allow them not only to survive infancy but also to live on into 
early adulthood. In this review, we will (i) present a historical 
perspective of HLHS; (ii) describe the Norwood operation, the 
most important breakthrough in the management of HLHS; 
(iii) discuss important modifications of this innovative surgi￾cal approach; (iv) review additional developments that have 
contributed substantially to the improved outcomes in patients 
with HLHS; and (v) explain the second and third surgical pro￾cedures necessary to sustain their lives beyond infancy.
Historical Perspective
In 1952, Lev first described a left hypoplastic heart mal￾formation as underdevelopment of the left-sided cardiac 
chambers along with a small ascending aorta and aortic 
arch. This defect was not introduced as a syndrome until 
1958 when Noonan and Nadas described it as a combined 
aortic and mitral atresia malformation (3,4). At birth, an 
infant with this anatomy can survive as long as the duc￾tus arteriosus (DA) remains patent and a communication 
between the left and right atria is present, allowing the right 
ventricle to maintain cardiac output to the systemic circu￾lation (Figure 1). If the DA closes, systemic blood flow is 
compromised and clinical deterioration rapidly ensues. In 
1979, Yabek and Mann described the first reported use of 
prostaglandin E1
 (PGE1
) to maintain ductal patency in a 
patient with HLHS (5). Continuous infusion of PGE1
, how￾ever, is not a long-term solution. Indeed, regarding the use 
of the PGE1
 in children with HLHS, the authors of the afore￾mentioned case report concluded “Although this entity is 
universally fatal, the transient palliation and improvement 
which resulted allowed us to exclude potentially correctable 
defects.” (5).
As the field of pediatric cardiovascular surgery evolved, 
efforts were directed toward discovering a surgical strat￾egy that could allow children to live without the necessity 
of PGE1
 and therefore support long-term viability. In 1970, 
Cayler et al. reported their approach in a neonate with hypo￾plastic left heart and an adequately sized aorta (6). In this 
patient, the ascending aorta was anastomosed to the right 
pulmonary artery to augment blood flow to the systemic cir￾culation and the pulmonary arteries were banded distal to 
this anastomosis to limit pulmonary blood flow to the lung. 
This patient survived until 7 mo of age, but had limited appli￾cability because the aortas in the majority of patients with 
HLHS are diminutive. In 1977, Doty and Knott described 
their approach in five neonates in which pulmonary venous 
return to the left atrium was baffled to the tricuspid valve, the 
main pulmonary artery was transected and connected to the 
aortic arch via a conduit, and the distal pulmonary artery was 
anastomosed to the right atrium to allow for passive pulmo￾nary blood flow (7). All five of these infants died as a result of 
inadequate right ventricular function or compromised coro￾nary blood flow.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Review
The Norwood Procedure
In 1979, Norwood et al. were the first to establish a staged 
surgical management program for patients with HLHS (8). In 
1983, they reported the course of the first child in this program 
who was clinically well at 6 mo of life (8). This patient was full 
term newborn who was taken to operating room at 3 d of age 
for what would become known as the Norwood procedure. For 
this patient, an anastomosis between the proximal main pul￾monary artery and the ascending aortic arch was established, 
and a 4-mm polytetrafluorethylene shunt was placed connect￾ing the new aortic arch to the pulmonary artery branches. This 
patient was discharged to home on the 18th postoperative day.
The importance of the Norwood procedure to children born 
with HLHS and the fields of pediatric cardiology, cardiovascu￾lar surgery, and cardiac intensive care cannot be understated. 
Since Norwood’s momentous publication, the operation has 
steadily evolved into the standard of care for HLHS and not 
only has given hope to children born with this devastating 
lesion but also has catalyzed the development of modern pedi￾atric cardiac intensive care units. The aim of the revolutionary 
procedure is to use the right ventricle as the main pumping 
chamber for support of the system circulation. To be able to 
achieve this goal, the following steps are required (Figure 2): (i) 
the atrial septum must be removed to secure good atrial com￾munication, which is required to permit pulmonary venous 
return to reach the right ventricle; (ii) a connection between 
the right ventricle and aorta is created by reconstructing the 
aorta using the tissue of the proximal main pulmonary artery; 
(iii) a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt is placed between 
a branch of the aorta and branch of the pulmonary artery, to 
be the new source of pulmonary blood flow (and long-term 
replacement for the PGE1
-dependent DA) (8). At the conclu￾sion of this operation, the right ventricle is pumping blood into 
a “neoaorta” and a portion of this blood is shunted to the pul￾monary vasculature bed. In other words, the right ventricle is 
tasked with providing blood to both circulations in parallel, as 
opposed to traditional two ventricle physiology where blood 
travels to the pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation 
in series. Ideally, blood flow generated by the single right ven￾tricle will be “balanced,” so that similar amounts of blood will 
flow to the pulmonary and systemic circulations, i.e., at a 1:1 
ratio. A discussion regarding the many ways in which pulmo￾nary and systemic blood flow can be manipulated, either medi￾cally or surgically, to ensure this optimal ratio is beyond the 
scope of this review.
In the unique Norwood anatomy and physiology, oxygen￾ated pulmonary venous blood returning to the left atrium 
mixes with deoxygenated systemic venous blood returning to 
the right atrium, and this mixed blood then flows into the right 
ventricle, where it is pumped to the systemic and pulmonary 
circulations. As a result, typical arterial oxygen saturations for 
these children are in the range of 75–85%. These lower arte￾rial oxygen saturations (as compared with normal individu￾als) are surprisingly well-tolerated. In fact, the ability for these 
neonates to adapt to and tolerate this “unnatural” physiology 
is one of the more fascinating aspects of contemporary pediat￾ric cardiology and one of the more confusing notions for care 
providers unfamiliar with HLHS and the Norwood procedure.
The systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt used by Norwood 
was a modification of the Blalock-Taussig (B-T) shunt, first 
famously described by Alfred Blalock and Helen Taussig in 
1945 (9,10). This type of shunt, which is still commonly used 
today, is a polytetrafluorethylene tube that connects the right 
innominate or subclavian artery to the right pulmonary artery 
and is required because the main pulmonary artery is utilized 
to create the neoaorta (8). As pulmonary vascular resistance 
and pulmonary arterial pressure are typically lower than sys￾temic vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure, blood 
flows through the shunt from the innominate or subclavian 
Figure 1. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. At birth, children with hypo￾plastic left heart depend upon blood pumped by the right ventricle into 
the pulmonary artery (PA) to supply blood to the systemic circulation and 
end organs via a patent ductus arteriosus (DA). In many cases, coarctation 
of the aorta (CoAo) is also present.

artery to the right pulmonary artery. The shunt is typically 
3.5 or 4mm in diameter, depending on the size of the child, 
and under optimal circumstances, should act as a fixed resis￾tor that prevents the undesirable clinical scenario of excessive 
pulmonary blood flow with inadequate systemic blood flow. 
If blood flow through the shunt does become excessive, even 
transiently, systemic blood flow, and coronary perfusion can 
be compromised. This phenomenon is referred to as “coro￾nary steal,” which can result in decreased myocardial function, 
malignant arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (11). On the 
other hand, acute shunt thrombosis, either partial or complete, 
is also a well-described complication that results in obstruc￾tion to pulmonary blood flow and profound life-threatening 
hypoxemia (12).
As an alternative to this tenuous shunt physiology, there have 
been many attempts to create a direct connection between right 
ventricle and pulmonary artery via a right ventricle-to-pulmo￾nary artery (RV-to-PA) conduit (13). In 1981, prior to their 
landmark report of their successful Norwood procedure with 
modified B-T shunt placement, Norwood et al. tried utilizing 
nonvalved RV-to-PA conduits of varying sizes, but all patients 
died within 11h after surgery due to either excessive pulmo￾nary blood flow or cardiac failure (13). As a result of these early 
failures, the RV-to-PA conduit was overshadowed by the suc￾cess of the B-T shunt until the late 1990s, when Shunji Sano 
revisited this notion. In 2003, Sano published his report of 19 
infants with HLHS who undergo a “modified” Norwood proce￾dure using a nonvalved polytetrafluorethylene RV-to-PA con￾duit instead of the traditional B-T shunt (14). Hospital survival 
was 89% and overall survival was 62%, comparable to other 
reports of children who undergo the traditional Norwood 
procedure using a B-T shunt. From these encouraging results, 
interest in the “Sano shunt” had been piqued.
The main theoretical advantage of using an RV-to-PA con￾duit is the lesser degree of diastolic “run-off ” blood flow 
as compared with the B-T shunt, leading to higher diastolic 
blood pressures and consequent improved coronary perfu￾sion. There was hope that this advantage would translate into 
fewer early (and often sudden) deaths after the Norwood 
procedure, thought to be related in part to tenuous coronary 
blood flow (15). In contrast to the Norwood procedure with 
B-T shunt placement, however, the RV-to-PA conduit requires 
a right ventriculotomy (i.e., cutting into the ventricle to create 
an opening for the conduit), and the nonvalved nature of the 
conduit can lead to regurgitant flow. These theoretical disad￾vantages of the RV-to-PA conduit may increase the risk of ven￾tricular arrhythmias, impair systemic right ventricle function, 
or cause volume overload (16–18). The excitement over the 
potential advantages and concern for the potential risks of the 
Sano shunt led to the seminal Single Ventricle Reconstruction 
(SVR) Trial (19).
The SVR Trial
Following Sano’s pivotal work, many single-institution series 
were published comparing outcomes of the Norwood proce￾dure with a traditional B-T shunt vs. the RV-to-PA conduit 
(15,20–23). Because of the conflicting nature of some of the 
data and the limitations inherent to single-center observations, 
a prospective randomized trial was needed to study this cru￾cial question. Despite the logistical difficulties with conducting 
a large multicenter randomized controlled study in pediatric 
cardiac surgery, including the need for a large enough cohorts 
from which meaningful statistical analyses can be conducted, 
Ohye and numerous collaborators within the Pediatric Heat 
Network Investigators of North America were able to organize 
and complete the SVR trial (19).
The SVR trial, considered to be one of the most remarkable 
multicenter collaborations in any field of medicine in our cur￾rent era, comprised more than 500 patients with HLHS enrolled 
from 15 centers randomized to a Norwood procedure with 
either a B-T shunt or RV-to-PA conduit. The trial was conducted 
between May 2005 and July 2008, with a primary outcome mea￾sure of death or cardiac transplant-free survival at 12 mo of age. 
Secondary outcomes were unintended cardiovascular inter￾ventions, right ventricular function, hospital course, and other 
serious adverse events. Transplant-free survival at 1 y of age in 
the 274 infants who underwent the Norwood procedure with 
RV-to-PA conduit was 73.3%, as compared with 63.6% in the 
275 infants who undergo the Norwood procedure with B-T 
shunt, a statistically significant difference (P-value = 0.01). On 
the other hand, unintended cardiovascular interventions and 
postoperative complications were more common in patients 
with RV-to-PA conduits, and pulmonary artery growth, right 
ventricular-end diastolic size, and right ventricle ejection frac￾tion over time were more favorable in patients with B-T shunts 
(19). Furthermore, the survival benefit of the RV-to-PA conduit 
over time became less apparent, with no significant difference 
in survival between the two groups when the all follow-up data 
(mean 32±11 mo) were analyzed.
In addition to these valuable data, the SVR trial has become 
a fruitful source of secondary analyses and follow-up stud￾ies, providing the pediatric cardiovascular community with a 
unique opportunity to continue to glean insight into the short￾and long-term outcome of children with HLHS. Most recently, 
Oster et al. reviewed the SVR data and identified an associa￾tion between digoxin, a medication that has been in existence 
for more than a century, and reduced mortality following hos￾pital discharge after the Norwood procedure (24). This study is 
but one example of additional vital data being published from 
this landmark study, and part of the reason why an author 
recently wrote an editorial aptly entitled “The Single Ventricle 
Reconstruction Trial: The Gift that Keeps on Giving.” (25)
The Hybrid Procedure
Although the Norwood operation has become the standard of 
care for neonates born with HLHS, the complexity of the pro￾cedure and the need for cardiopulmonary bypass require that 
the neonate be somewhat clinically stable prior to the proce￾dure. Some neonates such as those born very prematurely or 
those who develop life-threatening illnesses shortly after birth 
(e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis and neonatal sepsis) are deemed 
too sick to undergo the Norwood procedure. An alternative

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Review
technique known as the hybrid procedure was first reported by 
Gibbs et al. in 1993. The less intensive approach combines inter￾ventional cardiac catheterization with off-cardiopulmonary 
bypass surgery (26). It achieves the same physiological objectives 
as the classic Norwood procedure in a less intensive manner, as 
follows: (i) pulmonary artery bands are placed on the right and 
left pulmonary arteries to increase the pressure in the main pul￾monary artery, in attempt to prevent excessive pulmonary flow 
and ensure adequate systemic blood flow; (ii) patency of the 
ductal arteriosus is maintained with a stent placed by an inter￾ventional cardiologist; and (iii) unrestricted mixing or pulmo￾nary and systemic venous return at atrial level is accommodated 
by performing either surgical atrial septectomy or balloon atrial 
septostomy (Figure 3). The timing of these procedures varies, 
dependent on center preference and patient condition (26–29).
Although children with HLHS who undergo the hybrid pro￾cedure have many physiologic similarities to those children who 
undergo the Norwood operation, the manner in which their 
coronary and cerebral circulations are perfused is notably differ￾ent. After the Norwood operation, blood is ejected into the aorta 
and flows anterograde, directly providing perfusion to the coro￾nary and cerebral vascular beds. In children with hybrid anat￾omy, blood ejected into the pulmonary artery traverses the DA 
and provides coronary and cerebral blood flow in a retrograde 
manner, through the native aortic arch (Figure 3). Accordingly, 
stenosis or obstruction can occur at the sight where the DA 
connects to the native aorta, a complication that is termed ret￾rograde aortic arch obstruction (30,31). The occurrence rate of 
retrograde aortic arch obstruction has been reported to be 10–
24% and can have a significant impact on perfusion to these vital 
organs (30,31). In fact, in patients in whom it occurs, especially 
early after the hybrid procedure, it has been associated increased 
mortality (30,31). For these children, surgical conversion to 
Norwood anatomy may be warranted.
Since its initial conception, the hybrid procedure has not 
only given tenuous neonates with HLHS a chance at survival, 
but has also been applied in other clinical scenarios. For exam￾ple, the hybrid procedure has been applied to some children 
with HLHS who have a borderline left ventricle, which is a 
ventricle that is smaller than normal but has potential to grow 
large enough to allow for a two ventricle repair. In some of 
these children, the hybrid procedure has been used as a bridge 
to allow for time to determine if adequate left ventricle growth 
can occur (32,33).
The avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass is another appeal￾ing aspect of the hybrid procedure, as the use of cardiopulmo￾nary bypass in the newborn period has been associated with 
abnormal neurocognitive development (34,35). This poten￾tial (but unproven) advantage has, at least in part, prompted 
some institutions to apply the hybrid approach to the major￾ity of their patients with HLHS (30). Galantowicz et al. were 
one of the first groups to truly embrace the hybrid procedure, 
reporting short-term survival of 90% in 40 patients with HLHS 
managed with this approach (30). More recently, Yerebakan 
et  al. presented their experience of 182 patient with HLHS 
who undergo hybrid procedure, reporting an operative sur￾vival of 97.5% (36). Despite these encouraging results, most 
centers restrict use of the hybrid procedure to their most frag￾ile neonates and rely on the more traditional and established 
Norwood procedure for the majority of their children with 
HLHS. The hybrid procedure will likely need to be subjected 
to more rigorous study, akin to what was accomplished with 
the SVR Trial, before more widespread application occurs.
Interstage Monitoring
Thus far, this review has focused on the innovations that have 
allowed many children with HLHS to survive the neonatal 
period and be successfully discharged to home after this sur￾gical intervention. The Norwood procedure, however, repre￾sents only the first step toward a chance at long-term survival. 
These children ultimately require two additional surgical pro￾cedures, commonly referred to as the stage II and stage III 
surgeries. The period of time between hospital discharge after 
the Norwood procedure and the stage II surgery, commonly 
referred to as the interstage period, has been well-recognized 
as a period of considerably fragility. The risk of mortality dur￾ing this time is high (8–12%) (37–39), and death is often sud￾den and unexpected (40,41). An analysis of the patients in the 
SVR trial identified prematurity, certain anatomic variations, 
and socioeconomic factors as independent risk factors for 
interstage mortality (38). The presence of a B-T shunt was also 
identified as a risk factor for interstage mortality in the subset 
of infants without moderate-to-severe atrioventricular valve 
regurgitation.
Close outpatient surveillance has thus far been shown to be 
the most effective means of minimizing interstage attrition in 
children with HLHS and has therefore become a crucial com￾ponent of their care. Seminal work by Ghanayem et al. dem￾onstrated improved survival after establishment of an intensive 
interstage home monitoring program for children with HLHS.

Review Yabrodi and Mastropietro
The interstage mortality was 0% after introduction of this home 
monitoring program at their institution and the improvement 
was sustained over a 10-y period (37,42). Their results have 
since led to the development of similar programs around the 
world (39,43). These programs typically provide families with 
an infant scale and pulse oximeter for their homes, and require 
regular phone interviews and clinic appointments aimed at 
detecting early warning signs before clinical deterioration can 
occur. Moreover, many centers have established interstage 
multidisciplinary clinics to provide regular comprehensive 
assessments including meticulous evaluation of nutritional 
status and oral-motor feeding skills by specialized dieticians 
and speech therapists (44). On the other hand, a recently com￾pleted multicenter study by Oster et al. through the National 
Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative 
database showed no association between daily weight and oxy￾gen monitoring with mortality, heart transplantation, readmis￾sion, or weight gain (24). Hence, although there should be little 
debate regarding the positive impact of intensive interstage 
home monitoring on contemporary outcomes for children 
with HLHS, the value of each of the individual components of 
these programs remains unclear.
The Stage II and III Operations
Patients with HLHS require their stage II and III surgical pro￾cedures to convert their physiology from one volume over￾loaded ventricle pumping two circulations in parallel into 
physiology in which blood flows through the pulmonary and 
systemic circulations in series, thereby “unloading” the single 
ventricle such that it only has to pump one circulation. Effective 
pulmonary blood flow therefore must occur in the absence of 
a pulmonary ventricle. This seemingly insurmountable chal￾lenge was accomplished with the use of cavopulmonary anas￾tomoses or shunts. The concept of a cavopulmonary shunt was 
first proposed by the Italian surgeon Carlon and his coworkers 
based on experiments using dogs and human cadavers (45). In 
1958, William Glenn reported his first successful cavopulmo￾nary shunt on a living human (46). The patient was a 7-y-old 
boy with a single cardiac ventricle, transposition of the great 
arteries and pulmonic stenosis. In what would become known 
as the classic Glenn operation, the right superior vena cava 
was anastomosed to the right pulmonary artery. In the cur￾rent era, the procedure has been modified slightly and is com￾monly referred to as a bidirectional Glenn, and has become 
the standard of care as the second stage operation for patients 
with HLHS.
The bidirectional Glenn operation consists of connecting 
superior the vena cava to the cranial portion of right pulmo￾nary artery to provide blood flow to both pulmonary branches 
(47) (Figure 4). This physiology can also be created with the 
hemi-Fontan operation, a modification of the bidirectional 
Glenn in which (i) the central pulmonary arteries undergo 
patch augmentation, (ii) a connection between the right atrial￾to-superior vena cava junction and pulmonary arteries is con￾structed, and (iii) patch closure of the right atrial-to-superior 
vena cava junction is completed, obviating the need to ligate 
the superior vena cava (48). Regardless of which technique is 
preferred, the overall results of stage II procedures have been 
excellent, exceeding 95% in several large series (49).
In order for the superior cavopulmonary anastomosis to 
function appropriately, an infant’s pulmonary vascular resis￾tance and pulmonary arterial pressure must be low enough to 
permit the so-called “passive” pulmonary blood flow from the 
systemic venous system. Experience has suggested that beyond 
3 mo of age, pulmonary vascular resistance is low enough 
in most infants to move forward with the stage II operation 
(50), although it has been performed in infants as young as 1 
mo of age by programs focused on reducing the duration of 
the tenuous interstage period (51,52). Regardless of the age 
at which the surgery is performed, several important physi￾ologic changes occur following its completion. The unloaded 
single ventricle has reduced end diastolic volume (because it 
only needs to pump blood to one circulation), which decreases 
ventricular wall stress and improves function of the atrioven￾tricular valve, both of which lead to more efficient ventricular 
function (53). In addition, the systemic-to-pulmonary artery 
shunt is no longer needed and thus ligated, decreasing diastolic 
run-off and thereby increasing diastolic blood pressure and 
coronary perfusion (54,55). These physiologic improvements 
can allow patients, in many cases, to thrive for several years 
prior to their next (and hopefully final) surgical stage, known 
as the Fontan operation.
During the stage II operation, only systemic venous return 
from the upper body is directed into the pulmonary circula￾tion via the superior cavopulmonary anastomosis. Systemic 
venous return from the lower body continues to flow into the 
right atrium via the inferior vena cava, mixing with pulmonary 
venous return and resulting in arterial oxygen saturations of 
Figure 4. Stage II surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome—bidi￾rectional Glenn: The superior vena cava (SVC) is transected and anasto￾mosed to the pulmonary artery (PA). Cerebral and upper extremity blood 
passively flows to the lungs through the PA via the SVC. Oxygenated 
pulmonary venous blood then enters a common atrium, mixes with 
deoxygenated blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC), and enters the 
right ventricle where it is pumped through the neoaorta (NeoAo) to the 
systemic circulation.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Review
70–90%. As patients grow from infants to toddlers, and oxy￾gen consumption in the lower portion of the body increases, 
a greater amount of desaturated blood flows into the right 
atrium via the inferior vena cava. As a result, progressive cya￾nosis can occur and can dictate the need for their Fontan oper￾ation. The concept of the Fontan operation was first applied 
to a patient with tricuspid atresia by Francis Fontan in 1968 
(56), but has since become the final surgical stage for patients 
with HLHS. The goal of this ingenious operation is to direct 
the desaturated systemic venous return the inferior vena cava 
into the pulmonary circulation, which can be done either via 
a lateral tunnel (Figure 5) or extracardiac conduit that con￾nects the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery (57,58). In 
some patients, small fenestration may be created in the Fontan 
conduit, a modification aimed at providing children with this 
unique anatomy and physiology with another means to fill 
their single ventricle, albeit with desaturated blood (59). This 
practice may be especially helpful in patients with relatively 
high pulmonary vascular pressures, although studies attempt￾ing to discern the merits of these theoretical benefits have been 
conflicting (60,61).
Long-Term Complications
Despite the aforementioned advancements, patients with 
HLHS have considerable long-term morbidity following their 
Fontan operation, and early mortality is not uncommon (62). 
In a recent single center report, only 40% of children with 
HLHS who survived through all three surgical stages were alive 
at 10 y after their Fontan operation (63). High systemic venous 
pressures, abnormal ventricular morphology, thromboembolic 
events, and recurrent arrhythmias can create a tremendous 
burden of disease for these children (64,65). Exercise intoler￾ance, congestive heart failure, hepatic dysfunction, and disease 
processes more specific to patients with Fontan physiology 
such as protein-losing enteropathy and plastic bronchitis are 
additional complications that can occur and further negatively 
impact their quality of life (64,65). As short-term outcomes 
continue to improve, efforts to better understand and manage 
these long-term challenges will likely become the dominant 
focus of research for these unique children.
Fetal Intervention
Another exciting development in the management of HLHS 
is fetal cardiac intervention, which has emerged as a possible 
means of altering the natural history of significant cardiac 
anomalies in utero, with the ultimate goal of improving survival 
and long-term outcomes. In 1991, Maxwell et al. published 
their experience with in utero dilation of the aortic valves of 
two patients with severe aortic stenosis. Since this report, there 
have been an increasing number of centers across the world 
who are attempting fetal cardiac interventions, most often 
for severe aortic stenosis (66). Since many fetuses with severe 
aortic stenosis will eventually be born with HLHS, clinicians 
hope to prevent this progression with early fetal intervention. 
In 2010, International Fetal Cardiac Intervention Registry was 
established to collect data on all fetal cardiac intervention to 
learn from the combined experience of all centers (67). As 
more data from this registry become available, optimal candi￾dates for fetal cardiac intervention may be identified, with the 
goal of maximizing impact while minimizing risk.
CONCLUSION
Prior to the original breakthroughs of Norwood and his col￾leagues, children born with HLHS had less chance of survival. In 
the current era, because of Dr Norwood’s work and that of many 
others who have devoted their careers to improving outcomes in 
these children, survival beyond the neonatal period and into adult￾hood is not only possible but also commonplace. Morbidity and 
mortality in patients with HLHS, however, when compared with 
other congenital heart lesions, remain relatively high, indicating 
that much more work is needed. Moreover, as these children con￾tinue to survive longer, a better understanding of the long-term 
complications related to their unique physiology is imperative. 
Fortunately, the remarkable progress that has occurred over the 
last four decades, from comfort care to long-term survival, should 
make patients with HLHS, their families, and the physicians who 
care for them hopeful that outcomes will continue to improve.
