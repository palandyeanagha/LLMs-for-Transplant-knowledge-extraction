Abstract
Gene or protein expression data are usually represented by metric or at least ordinal variables. In order to translate a
continuous variable into a clinical decision, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point and to stratify patients into two
groups each requiring a different kind of treatment. Currently, there is no standard method or standard software for
biomarker cutoff determination. Therefore, we developed Cutoff Finder, a bundle of optimization and visualization methods
for cutoff determination that is accessible online. While one of the methods for cutoff optimization is based solely on the
distribution of the marker under investigation, other methods optimize the correlation of the dichotomization with respect
to an outcome or survival variable. We illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder by the analysis of the gene expression of
estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) in breast cancer tissues. This distribution of these important
markers is analyzed and correlated with immunohistologically determined ER status and distant metastasis free survival.
Cutoff Finder is expected to fill a relevant gap in the available biometric software repertoire and will enable faster
optimization of new diagnostic biomarkers. The tool can be accessed at http://molpath.charite.de/cutoff.

Introduction
The use of diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers is of
increasing importance in many areas of medicine. Many markers
are measured in laboratory assay as continuous variables or as
ordinal variables. Gene expression is usually measured on a metric
scale, using qRT-PCR or hybridization based methods, for
example using single gene assays such as TaqMan or on a global
scale using DNA microarrays. In tissue-based diagnostics, protein
expression is usually evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and quantified on an ordinal scale using the percentage of stained
cells, staining intensity or combinations of these. Examples of such
combinations include the Allred score that takes values between 0
and 8 [1,2] and the immunoreactive score (IRS) that takes values
between 0 and 12 [3,4].
In order to translate a continuous or ordinal diagnostic variable
into a clinical decision, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point
and to stratify patients into distinct groups each requiring a
different kind of treatment [5]. Although the mean or median
value of the diagnostic factor was used before, it is often desirable
to determine cutoff points based on the distribution of the variable
or by optimizing the correlation with clinical outcome or response
to a treatment. Methods for cutoff optimization include minimi￾zation of p-values or maximization of combinations of test
sensitivity and test specificity [6]. X-Tile is a freely available tool
that is specialized to the analysis of survival data and uses a
minimal p-value approach for cutoff optimization [7]. Previously,
like many others, we manually investigated and optimized cutoff
points of molecular markers [8–10]. However, methods for cut-off
determination vary among published studies and the underlying
algorithms remain obscure in many instances.
The literature is filled with newly identified biomarkers, but only
a small minority has found acceptance in patient care so far. This
is in part due to overestimation of the true effects in the first study
and a low reproducibility in subsequent validation studies. Cutoff
optimization was demonstrated to contribute to overestimation of
results when multiple cutoff points are investigated and the
problem of multiple hypothesis testing is ignored [11,12].
Conflicting the need of a higher degree of objectivity [13], cut￾off point determination is often done in a non-systematic manner
and therefore among the causes for a poor reproducibility of
biomarker studies.
The reason for this is the lack of comprehensive and easy-to-use
tools for cutoff determination. Therefore, we developed Cutoff
Finder, a bundle of optimization and visualization methods that are
accessible via the internet (http://molpath.charite.de/cutoff). The
purpose of the web application is twofold: (i) As not a single
methods can be considered to be optimal for all kind of data and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51862

all clinical situations, we implemented a multitude of five methods
for cutoff determination. (ii) To avoid overestimation of the true
effect, the robustness when varying the cutoff point can be
investigated in overview plots showing effect sizes with confidence
intervals. The workflow through the web application is shown in
Fig. 1.
Methods
Implementation and Availability
Cutoff Finder is a freely available web application that can be
accessed using an arbitrary web browser (http://molpath.charite.
de/cutoff). The web application is implemented as Java Server
Pages (JSPs) that connect to R using the R package and TCP/IP
server Rserve [14]. The R statistical language [15] serves as an
engine for all statistical computing and visualization. The R code
for cutoff optimization and the plot functions can be found in Text
S1. The R file is loaded as static source to the R server. For each
cutoff analysis, the web application calls the wrapper R function
get.cutoff() that serves as controller. The controller calls specialized
R functions for each kind of cutoff optimization and for each kind
of plot. Results of the cutoff optimization and plots are returned to
the web server. Using the R code, results and plots of the web page
can be reproduced 100%.
Analysis Workflow
The steps of data procession are shown in Figure 1:
1. The data are uploaded from a tab-separated table, rows
representing patients and columns representing variables. The
maximum number of rows is 5000, the maximum number of
columns is 50.
2. The user selects the biomarker and optionally outcome and
survival variables from the table columns.
3. The user selects the method for cutoff determination.
4. The user chooses the set of plots to be generated.
5. The inquiry is send to the statistical engine R. The optimal
cutoff point is determined and analysis plots are generated.
6. The user is directed to the results webpage, where the optimal
cutoff point and plots are shown.
Cutoff Determination
A multitude of five methods is offered for cutoff optimization.
The first method is based solely on the distribution of the
biomarker in the sample cohort. Methods 2–4 deal with
optimization of the correlation with a binary variable, for example
response to treatment. The last method is devoted to optimization
of the correlation with survival.

1. Fit of mixture model: A mixture model of two Gaussian
distributions is fitted to the histogram of the biomarker. This
procedure is implemented using the function flexmix from the R
package flexmix [16]. The optimal cutoff is determined as the
value where the probability density functions of the mixing
distribution coincide.
2. Significance of correlation with binary variable: This method
correlates the dichotomized biomarker with a binary outcome
variable using logistic regression. Logistic regression is executed
using the function glm from R package stats [15]. The optimal
cutoff is defined as the point with the most significant (Fisher’s
exact test) split. Odds ratios (ORs) as well as sensitivity and
specificity including 95% confidence intervals are calculated.
Confidence intervals for proportions are estimated using
Wilson’s method as it is implemented in the R package binom
[17].
3. Based on ROC curve: Two methods determine the cutoff point
by minimizing the distance on the ROC curve to the left top
edge of the diagram. The first method minimizes the Euclidean
distance between these points. The second method minimizes
the Manhattan distance between the points. Here, the sum of
sensitivity and specificity is maximized, equivalent to maximi￾zation of Youden’s statistics J = sensitivity+specificity –1 [18].
4. Minimum sensitivity or specificity: For each or these two
methods, the user enters a percentage value. The cutoff point is
chosen as the first threshold for the biomarker, where the
sensitivity (or specificity) exceeds this predefined value.
5. Significance of correlation with survival variable: This method
fits Cox proportional hazard models to the dichotomized
variable and the survival variable. Survival analysis is executed
using the functions coxph and survfit from the R package survival
[19]. The optimal cutoff is defined as the point with the most
significant (log-rank test) split. Hazard ratios (HRs) including
95% confidence intervals are calculated.
Additionally, the user can manually enter a cutoff point that is
used for calculations and visualization.
Visualization
Two different kinds of plots can be generated: overview plots
and plots at the cutoff point. Overview plots give a summary of all
possible cutoff points with the optimal cutoff marked by a vertical
line. The second kinds of plots are Waterfall and Kaplan-Meier
plots that are generated for a fixed cutoff point. The overview plots
include plots of ORs, HRs and differences in survival. ORs are
calculated using the function glm form the R package stats [15].
HRs are calculated using the function coxph from the R package
survival [19]. Differences in survival are calculated from the mean
survival times in the good prognosis and the poor prognosis group.
Mean survival times are estimated from the area under the
Kaplan-Meier curve using the maximum time that occurs in the
data as uniform time endpoint.
Example Data Sets
To illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder we analyzed gene
expression data from breast cancer tissues. To this end, the gene
expression series GSE2034, GSE7390 and GSE11121 were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) reposi￾tory [20,21]. We analyzed measurements of probe 205225_at for
estrogen receptor (ESR1) and of 208305_at for progesterone
receptor (PgR). The gene expression data are analyzed on log
scale, such that a difference of can be interpreted as fold change of
2.
Results
We illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder by the analysis of
the gene expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone
receptor (PgR) in breast cancer tissues. In routine diagnostic
protocols, ER and PgR status are determined based on the
percentage of positive cells in immunohistochemically stained
tissue sections. As an alternative approach, assessment of hormone
receptor status using gene expression is currently under investi￾gation in several studies [22]. Therefore, we extracted expression
data of ER and PgR from the publicly available microarray data
sets GSE2034 (286 patients), GSE7390 (198 patients) and
GSE11121 (200 patients). Cutoff points were defined for ER
Figure 3. Cutoff optimization by correlation with a binary variable or survival in the GSE2034 breast cancer data. (A) For each
possible cutoff, ESR1 gene expression is correlated with the immunohistologically determined ER status. The odds ratio (OR) including 95% CI is
plotted in dependence of the cutoff. A vertical line designates the dichotomization showing the most significant correlation with
immunohistologically determined ER status. (B) For each possible cutoff, PgR gene expression was correlated with distance metastasis free
survival. The hazard ratio (HR) including 95% CI is plotted in dependence of the cutoff. A vertical line designates the dichotomization showing the
most significant correlation with survival. The distribution of the gene expression values in the 286 tumors is shown as a rug plot at the bottom of the
figures.

and PgR and the correlation of the resulting split with
immunohistochemically determined ER status and distance
metastasis free survival was analyzed. All the figures presented in
the following were automatically generated by the web applica￾tion.
Fit of a Mixture Model
This method for cutoff determination is convenient for a
molecular variable with bimodal shaped distribution. The cutoff
point is optimized based on the hypothesis that the variable is
distributed according to a mixture of two Gaussian distributions.
Using this method, the histograms ER and PgR expression were
generated and optimal cutoff points were determined (Fig. 2). Both
distributions had a pronounced bimodal shape with cutoffs points
located at 10.6 (ER) and at 5.0 (PgR).
Optimizing the Correlation with Outcome
One of the most straightforward methods for cutoff optimiza￾tion concerning a binary outcome variable is to maximize the
significance of the 262 table. Other methods are discussed in a
paragraph below. As example, we searched for a cutoff point for
ER expression that optimally classifies with respect to ER status. In
this analysis, ER status is determined by immunohistochemistry
(IHC), the gold standard for investigation of ER and PgR. Fig. 3A
Figure 4. Plot of the differences in survival time. The mean survival time is estimated in the samples where the PgR is highly expressed and in
the samples where the PgR is lowly expressed. The difference of the mean survival times including is plotted. The distribution of PgR expression is
shown as rug plot at the bottom of the figure.

shows the correlation of gene expression and ER status according
to the designated cutoff point (Fig. 3A). The correlation was
significant for almost all (99.6%) of the investigated cutoff points.
The optimal cutoff was determined as 10.1 with odds ratio
OR = 67.8 (30.2–152.1).
Optimizing the Correlation with Survival
The straightforward method for determination of a prognostic
cutoff point is to optimize the significance of the split in the
Kaplan-Meier plot. As an example, we analyzed the correlation of
gene expression determined PgR status and distance metastasis￾free survival according to the designated cutoff point (Fig. 3B). The
correlation was significant over a large range (70%) of the
investigated cutoff points. The optimal cutoff was determined as
2.5 with hazard ratio HR = 0.46 (0.30–0.71). Additionally, a plot
showing the difference in survival times between the tumors of
high PgR expression and low PgR expression can be generated
(Fig. 4). These results are in accordance with the strong prognostic
relevance of PgR status for distance metastasis-free und overall
survival in breast cancer [23,24].
Plots at Cutoff Point
Next, we investigated the dichotomization induced by the IHC￾data-based and the survival-data-based cutoff determination in
more detail. Using ERS1 expression measured by the microarray,
determination of ER status was feasible with a sensitivity of 85.7%
and a specificity of 91.9% (Fig. 5A). Kaplan Meier analysis showed
a significantly better outcome for patients with high PgR
expression (Fig. 5B, p = 0.00028).
Comparison of Different Methods for Cutoff Optimization
For cutoff determination in the ER expression data, we
compared the mixture model approach and three approaches
based on comparison with immunohistologically determined ER
status (Tab. 1). The latter approaches included optimization of the
significance and of the distance of a point on the ROC curve from
the upper left edge of the ROC diagram. One of the ROC based
methods minimizes the Euclidean distance to this point, while the
other minimizes the Manhattan distance to this point. The cutoff
points determined by the significance method and by the
Euclidean distance method were exactly the same for all data
sets, while the Manhattan distance method agreed with these for
one of the data sets and derived by only 0.3 for the other data set.
The mixture model method showed a larger deviation from these
results and between the three data sets. However, all cutoffs were
between 9.6 and 11.2 resulting sensitivities greater than 88% and
specificities greater than 81%.
For cutoff determination in the PgR expression data, we
compared the mixture model approach and the approach based
on the significance of the split in the Kaplan-Meier plot. The
distribution based cutoffs for PgR expression were between 4.2
and 5.6 (Tab. 2). Interestingly, survival-data based cutoff
determinate led to a reduction of the cutoff value in some data
sets (GSE2034 and GSE11121) and to an increase of the cutoff
value in another data set (GSE7390).

exceeded 90%. Samples with expression between were considered to be
equivocal with respect to the test result and excluded. The samples that are not
in the equivocal zone between the cutoffs are considered as delivering a
reliable test result. Sensitivity and specificity of the test are estimated based on
these samples. A validation of the cutoffs 10.22 and 11.49 (determined in
GSE2034) was executed in GSE7390. Percentages for the training set are
reported including 95% confidence intervals.

Use Case: Development of a Molecular Test with
Sensitivity and Specificity Greater than 90%
Finally, we discuss the development of a test for ER status from
ER gene expression measured by the microarray probe 205552_at
(Tab. 3). Using immunohistochemistry as gold standard and
GSE2034 as training set, we executed two runs of Cutoff Finder to
determine cutoff points with sensitivity .90% and with specificity
.90%. Based on that, we defined a test result as positive, if it was
above the upper threshold (11.49) and as negative, if it was below
the lower threshold (10.22). The interval between the lower
threshold and the upper threshold was defined as equivocal zone
that contained only 6.6% of the samples in the training set. Using
GSE7390 as validation set, test sensitivity was again above 90%,
while test specificity was slightly below 90%, but inside the
confidence interval estimated from the training set.
Discussion
Cutoff Finder is a freely available in the internet (http://molpath.
charite.de/cutoff). The web application is straightforward to use:
The user can upload a molecular data set that optionally includes
outcome and/or survival data. Then, the user selects the variables
for analysis, the method for cutoff determination and the set of
plots. On a result web page, the optimal cutoff point, overview
plots and plots at the optimal cutoff point are displayed. The plots
can be downloaded and included in scientific publications.
The problem of the choosing the optimal cutoff is difficult to
answer generally. The best method for cutoff determination may
depend on the biomarker, the assay and the clinical application
under investigation. We exemplified this situation by analyzing the
agreement between RNA based with immunohistology based
determination of estrogen receptor status using different methods.
It turned out that the cutoff points determined by three
optimization methods in two data sets were very similar (all
between 10.1 and 10.7). We believe that this is a consequence of
the high concordance between gene expression and immunohis￾tology in this use case, while in other situations cutoffs determined
by different methods can differ substantially [6]. To cope with
different biomarkers and assays, Cutoff Finder offers a multitude of
five methods for cutoff optimization.
Stratification into two groups, but not into three or more
groups, seems to be most natural for translation into clinics where
most of the decisions are binary (treatment or no treatment).
However, some of the gene tests for breast cancer stratify patients
into a low risk and a high group (Mammaprint [25] and
Endopredict [26]), while other additionally introduce a medium
risk group (Oncotype DX [27]). An interesting feature of the
software X-Tile is simultaneous optimization of two cutoffs leading
to the identification of high, medium and low risk populations
using a minimal p-value approach. X-Tile is a bioinformatic tool
for prognostic cutoff optimization that is freely available to
academic users [7]. Cutoff Finder is primarily specialized to the
dichotomization situation. However, we provided an example of
stratification into three groups by two subsequent runs: Patients
were divided into a group where the test is highly sensitive, a group
where the test is highly specific and a group of the remaining
patients with equivocal test results.
Many of the methods for cutoff determination are based on
optimization of a target quantity in dependence of the cutoff. For
example, the target quantity can be the test accuracy or the
significance of correlation of the biomarker with outcome or
survival. It is clear that in such situation a multiple testing problem
occurs that can lead to overestimation of the significance of the
optimal cutoff and the effect size at the optimal cutoff [11,12,28].
Correction of p-values and confidence intervals for maximally
selected chi square statistics and maximal selected log rank test was
investigates in the 1980s and the 1990s [29–32]. Cutoff Finder
addresses the multiple testing problem by visualizing odds ratios or
hazard rations including confidence intervals for each of the
cutoffs under investigation. This kind of plots together with the
proportion of significant tests can help to assess the stability and
significance of the dichotomization. Further, we recommend
integrating cutoff optimization in a sequential biomarker study
design: In the first step of such an approach, the cutoff is optimized
in one or more retrospective studies. In the second step, the
predefined cutoff is validated in one or more retrospective or
prospective studies. Both steps can be executed using Cutoff Finder.
Pathologists often use packages like SPSS (SPSS, Inc., an IBM
Company), GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) or
Winstat (R.Fitch Software) in order to correlate biomarkers with
outcome or survival data. However, neither of them includes
functions for cutoff optimization. Therefore, cutoffs are often
chosen as median or mean value of the biomarker or adjusted
manually. For example, percentile based cutoffs were also
implemented in our previous project where biomarkers can be
assessed for their association to survival [33]. The commercial
software JMP (SAS, Inc.) allows for optimizing a dichotomization
for correlation with a binary outcome variable in a multivariate
context. However, distribution-based cutoff optimization or cutoff
optimization in context of a survival variable is not supported. The
STEPP method allows graphical assessment of treatment-covariate
interactions using Cox models on subsets of the data [34–36].
However, STEPP addresses the analysis of a clinical study in a
series of overlapping patient subgroups rather than optimization of
a cutoff point.
A specialty of Cutoff Finder is the plot of ORs and HRs
including confidence intervals. The plots include information on
both, the strength and significance of the prognostic stratification.
This is in particular important in complex situations where ORs or
HRs change strongly in dependence of the cutoff. For example, in
a study on Ki67 protein expression in lung cancer, we observed
positive HRs for low cutoffs and negative HRs for high cutoffs
(data not shown).
Cutoff Finder was developed to facilitate cutoff optimization for
tissue biomarkers that are investigated in pathology research.
Additionally, we expect our software to be interesting for a wider
group of scientists, including clinical chemists and other biomed￾ical investigators, who want to convert a metric or ordinal variable
into a dichotomization. As an example, we analyzed the
expression of hormone receptors in breast cancer tissues. Cutoff
point determination using different analysis modes turned out to
be feasible and useful. In summary, we presented a comprehensive
and straightforward tool for cutoff point optimization that can help
to improve the quality of biomarker studies.
