Abstract
To improve the welfare of experimental animals, investigators seek to respect the 3R principle (Replacement,
Reduction, and Refinement). Even when large animal studies are essential before moving to clinical trials, it is
important to look for ways to reduce the number of experimental animals used. At the Center for the Development
of Advanced Medical Technology, we consider ‘medical’ pigs to be ideal preclinical model systems.
We have been using both wild-type and genetically modified pigs. We began using this approach about 10 years
ago with a ‘total pig system’ to model human health and disease for the purposes of both medical skill education
and the development of new devices and therapeutic strategies.
At our Center, medical students and residents use pigs to gain experience with surgical skills and train for
emergency procedures after appropriate simulation training. Senior clinicians have also used these models to
advance the development of innovative tools for endo- and laparoscopic procedures. The Center focuses on
translational research for organ transplantation and stem cell therapy. Several pig models have been established for
liver, intestine, kidney, pancreas, and lung transplantation. Mesenchymal stromal cells have been established in
green fluorescent protein- and red fluorescent protein-transgenic pigs and tested to trans-differentiate
organogenesis. A program to establish induced pluripotent stem cells in the pig is ongoing at our Center.
Here, we review our 10 years of activity in this field. Based on our experience in surgical education and research,
experimental pigs are valuable models in translational research.

Introduction
Pigs and humans have anatomical and physiological
similarities. First, the immune system of pigs is similar
to that of humans, and second, inbred pigs such as
Clawn minipigs have genetically defined and fixed major
histocompatibility complex, making reproducible studies
of immunologic mechanisms possible [1-4]. Therefore,
the pig has attracted attention as a valuable preclinical
model for medical research. Although there have been
few reports of the scientific advantages of using pigs as
such models, there are multiple reports of the use of
dogs and non-human primates. Because of the ethical
limitations on using mongrel dogs for medical education
and research in Japan, we decided to use a different
medium-sized experimental animal as a model.
From 2001 to 2002, with the help of a grant established
by Tochigi Prefecture to promote regional economic
activity, we surveyed several institutions in Japan that
used pigs as experimental models. Our investigation of
the numbers of pigs used in experiments by all of the
medical universities in Japan revealed that there was
scant information available on the use of pigs. Further￾more, the support system for using these animals as
biomedical models was poor. More than 60% of 115 uni￾versities surveyed had no experience in the postoperative
care of experimental pigs, and fewer than 10 domestic or
miniature pigs were used annually at another university.
As a result, we started the Tochigi Pig Project to study
the use of pigs as biomedical models [5].

Establishment of a total care system for medical pigs
Over the last 10 years, we have studied several kinds of pig.
They are classified into three categories on the basis of
body size. Our new pig research center, the Center for De￾velopment of Advanced Medical Technology (CDAMTec),
began full-scale operations in 2008 (Figure 1A). CDAMTec
has three important goals - education, surgical training, and
pre-clinical research - and a number of academic investiga￾tors and physicians have been recruited to the center
(Figure 1B). CDAMTec provides advanced-level clinical
care and testing, including computed tomography (CT),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and an ICU
(Figure 1C, Additional file 1: Movie S1). Furthermore, an
advanced imaging system is used to combine CT and MRI
data for surgical support (Figure 1D, Additional file 2:
Movies S2 and Additional file 3: Movies S3). The Center is
used for surgical training and education in high-risk tech￾niques or techniques where high skill levels are needed, or
before the initiation of clinical trials [6].
Jichi Medical University introduced the use of pigs as
part of the Bedside Learning phase of clinical surgical
education at CDAMTec. The curriculum is composed of
four sections: Bioethics, Orientation, Practical training,
and Verification of surgical skills.
The Advanced Trauma Operative Management course
was established in the United States in 2000 to standardize
the operative management of trauma patients. The course
is given to senior surgeons and senior surgical residents,
by using a one-to-one instruction system. The course was
brought to Japan in 2008 and began at CDAMTec. We
also offer separate training for surgical residents to im￾prove their skills with a dry-lab and microsurgical training
[See Additional file 4: Movie S4].
In addition to training in specific procedures, all users of
the facility are educated regarding the welfare of ex￾perimental animals. The design of the programs con￾ducted has reduced the overall number of experimental
pigs used in training [7].
Research using domestic pigs
The animals used in these training programs are domestic
pigs with a mature body weight of approximately 100 kg. In
the early stage of the project, we focused on the medical
use of domestic pigs with help from farmers close to the
university. Domestic pigs are easily obtained and inexpen￾sive, because they are well established as a food source.
They are produced in a three-breed terminal system by
crossbreeding among Landrace, Large White, and Duroc
colonies (Figure 2A). Young pigs weighing approximately
30 to 40 kg are often used for medical training and
research.
At Jichi Medical University before this project was
started, medical students practiced their surgical skills on
mongrel dogs. Because of recent changes to both animal
welfare and public opinion in Japan, mongrel dogs are no
longer used for medical education and research. In 2000,
the use of all experimental animals in educational courses
at Jichi Medical University was changed from dogs to pigs
(Figure 2B).
At the same time, studies were initiated to investigate
differences in liver metabolism between humans and pigs.
A simple surgical model was established that utilizes an in￾ternal shunt. First, changes in microsomal P450 isoforms
after therapeutic liver resection were studied by using this
model [8]. Partial occlusion (portal vein and hepatic artery
occlusion) decreased the activities of CYP2C, CYP2E, and
CYP3A, but not those of CYP1A and CYP2D. CYP3A,
which accounts for an average of 30% of the total P450
content in the human liver, was most susceptible to warm
ischemia. The metabolism of the anesthetic drug, propofol,
was then examined [9]. Propofol is known to have intra￾and extrahepatic metabolic pathways, but the effect of its
continuous infusion during long-term anhepatic states had
not been determined. Hemodynamic parameters related to
the pharmacokinetics of continuously infused propofol
(6 mg/kg/hr) were also investigated. Although there were
changes in the heart rate, no significant changes in the
concentration of hemoglobin or in hemodynamic para￾meters were observed during the anhepatic phase when
propofol was continuously infused. Mixed venous, arterial,
and portal vein propofol concentrations were stable during
the anhepatic phase.
Using this model, three kinds of infusion solutions were
tested, namely lactated Ringer’s solution (LR, Lactec), ace￾tated Ringer’s solution (AR, VeenF), and acetated Ringer’s
solution with 1% glucose (AR-G, Phisio140) [10]. Although
no major difference was observed in the hemodynamic
parameters, arterial blood gas data, or electrolyte concen￾trations among the three groups, a significant and progres￾sive elevation of lactic acid levels was observed in the LR
group. Severe hypoglycemia was found in the LR and AR
groups, whereas the AR-G group maintained its blood glu￾cose levels throughout the anhepatic phase.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is highly prevalent among do￾mestic pigs, and substantial attention has been given to
keeping our center free from this virus [11]. We investi￾gated the prevalence of IgG class antibodies to pig HEV
(anti-HEV) and of HEV RNA among 152 domestic pigs at
2 months of age and 38 miniature pigs from 4 to 10 months
of age; the pigs had been obtained for research purposes
from five farms in Japan. HEV RNA was detected in 38%
of the domestic pigs; the 22 HEV isolates recovered from
the viremic pigs were 89.8% to 100% identical in the 412-
nucleotide sequence of open reading frame 2 and segre￾gated into three clusters within genotype 3. In contrast, all
of the miniature pigs, which came from farms different
from those where the domestic pigs were sourced, were
negative for both anti-HEV and HEV RNA. We concluded

that it is important to check that pigs provided for research
are HEV free.
We also began a program to share animal tissues,
whereby researchers can reuse various organs obtained
from euthanized animals [12]. In 2003, the number of
pigs used as experimental animals at our center rapidly
increased to more than 170. Moreover, the number of
chronic experiments has increased; such experiments
accounted for 48% of experiments using pigs in 2004.
Improvement of the effective utilization of these animals
is required from both an economic and an ethical point
of view. Experimental pigs undergo secondary use after
being euthanized, thus reducing the total number of ex￾perimental animals needed for medical research. Overall

numbers are similarly reduced through sharing and re￾use of miniature-pig tissues and cells for research. We
recommend this system, because it improves the quality
of medical education and research and facilitates the ef￾fective use of tissues and cells through sharing and reuse
among different investigators.
Development of an efficient system of pre-culture of
pig islets was ideal [13]. This program has continued,
resulting in a reduction in the total number of experi￾mental animals used.
Research using miniature pigs
Although miniature pigs are generally easier to handle and
more suitable for medical research than are domestic pigs,
miniature pigs are more expensive because of limited an￾nual production for experimental use in Japan. It is import￾ant to note that a mature miniature pig weighs 40 to 50 kg;
this weight is equivalent to that of an immature domestic
pig (Figure 2A).
Platelets promote tissue repair and liver regeneration.
After observing a positive response to human thrombo￾poietin (TPO) in mature miniature pigs, we found that
platelets prevent acute liver damage after extended hepa￾tectomy in pigs [14]. Thrombocytosis was induced by the
following two methods, and an 80% hepatectomy was per￾formed. In the first method, pigs received thrombopoietin
(TPO (+) group), and were compared with a control group
(TPO (−) group). In the second method, an experimental
group underwent splenectomy (Sp (+) group) to induce re￾active thrombocytosis and was compared with a control
group (Sp (−) group). Serum concentrations of the enzyme
induced by liver damage were significantly lower in the
thrombocytotic groups than in the control groups in the
early period after hepatectomy. Histopathological examin￾ation revealed hemorrhagic necrosis with a bile plug in the
control groups, but this phenomenon was not observed in
the thrombocytotic groups. We concluded that mature
miniature pigs respond to human TPO and that an
increased platelet count prevents acute liver damage after
extended hepatectomy in this species.
Investigators must optimize the perioperative care of ex￾perimental animals, but little is known about the effects of
anesthesia and surgery on serum chemistry in KCG mini￾ature pigs [15] (Figure 3, top panel). Our objective in an￾other study was to examine the influence of fasting and
surgery under general anesthesia on 27 serum chemistry
parameters in KCG miniature pigs so as to improve pre￾operative management. Crossbred KCG miniature pigs
were used at a mean of 12.3 months of age (range, 8.6 to
14.9 months) and 33.4 kg body weight (range, 24.0 to
40.2 kg). Serum chemistry was evaluated at the beginning
and end of a 24-hour fasting period (n = 6). No significant
differences were observed between the values tested at the
two time points. Partial hemilaminectomy of the lumbar
spine was performed in two groups of animals. Those given
sevoflurane anesthesia (n = 7) had significant decreases in
serum albumin, potassium, inorganic phosphorus, gamma￾glutamyltransferase peptidase, cholinesterase, and glucose
after surgery compared with levels before surgery. Animals
given isoflurane (n = 7) anesthesia had significantly decreased
total protein, albumin, triglyceride, phospholipids, sodium,
potassium, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline

phosphatase, and glucose after surgery compared with
levels before surgery. In a separate experiment (n = 7),
serum glucose and insulin also decreased during the post￾operative period after isoflurane anesthesia. These results
demonstrated that specific serum electrolytes, glucose,
and insulin were altered in KCG miniature pigs undergo￾ing general anesthesia. Investigators must be aware of the
effects of anesthetic agents on experimental animals so as
to provide optimum care and correct the interpretation of
experimental data.
Mexican hairless pigs (Figure 3, middle panel), which
were developed by Japan’s National Agriculture and Food
Research Organization, are highly suited for the evaluation
of topical agents, because the structure of their skin is simi￾lar to that of humans [16]. To evaluate the pharmacokinet￾ics of topical drugs, in vitro permeation studies are
performed by using the skin of euthanized animals or
human tissues resected at surgery; however, these methods
have limitations for evaluating in vivo pharmacokinetics.
Therefore, we studied the use of Mexican hairless pigs for
in vivo pharmacokinetics, especially for the evaluation of
drug concentrations in tissues. A ketoprofen patch was ap￾plied to the backs of Mexican hairless pigs for 24 hours;
this was followed by sequential collections of blood from 0
to 36 hours. Skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia, and muscle
from the center of the application site were excised 12
hours after patch application. Ketoprofen was first detected
in the plasma at 8 hours. The concentration increased until
24 hours and began to decrease after removal of the keto￾profen patch. Ketoprofen concentrations in the tissues
decreased with increasing tissue depth, but the amount in
the deep muscles, being the lowest among the tissues
examined, was still higher than that in the plasma. Drug
concentrations are difficult to test in human tissues, and
the Mexican hairless pig model appears to be attractive for
in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of topically applied keto￾profen. This breed has also been used to develop a new
medical device to connect the intestinal lumen percutan￾eously by using a double-balloon method [17].
Clawn miniature pigs (Figure 3, bottom panel) commer￾cially provided by the Japan Farm Clawn Institute are recom￾mended for use in transplantation research, because their
SLAs (swine leukocyte antigens) have been fixed, and defin￾ite immunological reactions are observed in models of intes￾tinal [18] and lung transplantation [19]. The outcome of
highly immunogenic transplantation remains unsatisfactory,
despite the development of potent immunosuppressants.
There is emerging clinical evidence that, paradoxically, ex￾pression of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3, a specific marker for
regulatory T cells) is upregulated in graft rejection. Levels of
mRNA expression of FOXP3, perforin, Fas-ligand (Fas-L),
and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IL-10) were
quantified in the peripheral blood and reached their highest
value as early as postoperative day four, followed by a
decline. Increased FOXP3 expression was not observed in
recipients given high-dose tacrolimus. In a miniature, such
as Clawn pig, transplantation model, FOXP3 mRNA levels
in the peripheral blood were upregulated in the early phase
of rejection. Thanks to the merits of this inbred colony,
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been established
for development by Hanazono [20]. The established iPS cells,
which have been confirmed to form teratomas in severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, are now being
tested in a syngeneic combination of mature Clawn pigs.
Research using genetically modified miniature pigs
As genetic modification techniques have developed, som￾atic cloning technology has become well established in
pigs. Recently, we produced cloned miniature pigs by using
oocytes derived from domestic pig ovaries [21]. For the
production of viable somatic-cell nuclear transferred
(SCNT) miniature pig embryos, the in vitro conditions for
controlling the quality of recipient oocytes derived from
domestic pig ovaries need to be evaluated. To obtain infor￾mation on the optimum in vitro maturation (IVM) condi￾tions for oocytes, we investigated the effect of IVM
duration of recipient oocytes on the subsequent develop￾ment of SCNT miniature pig embryos. We also investi￾gated maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity in
recipient oocytes before and after SCNT, along with the
occurrence of premature chromosome condensation
(PCC) and the spindle morphologies of donor nuclei fol￾lowing SCNT. The optimal window for the IVM period in
terms of the in vitro developmental ability of SCNT
embryos was 36 to 40 hours after the start of IVM. Use of
recipient oocytes matured for 36 or 40 hours, but not 44
or 52 hours, resulted in a high level of MPF activity before
and after SCNT and increased the occurrence of PCC in
transferred nuclei. The proportion of abnormal spindle￾like structures increased with prolongation of the IVM
period. In addition, SCNT embryos constructed from re￾cipient cytoplasts obtained after 40 hours of maturation by
using fetal fibroblasts of miniature pigs were transferred to
surrogate miniature pigs and developed to full term. These
results suggest that recipient oocytes matured for 36 hours
or 40 hours show effective induction of PCC with a normal
cytoskeletal structure because of a high level of MPF activ￾ity. Furthermore, the 40 hour IVM period improves the
in vitro development of SCNT embryos to the blastocyst
stage, resulting in the production of viable cloned mini￾ature pigs.
Animal imaging sources have become indispensable in
the biological sciences. Specifically, gene-encoded bio￾logical probes serve as stable and high-performance tools
for visualizing the fate of cells in living animals. Green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic Jinhua pigs have been
established and show normal growth and reasonable repro￾ductive activity [22]. In this transgenic pig model, a green
Kobayashi et al. Transplantation Research 2012, 1:8 Page 6 of 9
http://www.transplantationresearch.com/content/1/1/8

emission is observed in the body under an excitation light.
We use a somatic cell cloning technique to create new
miniature-sized GFP-expressing Jinhua pigs; this enables
us to characterize expression profiles in various tissues or
organs and under various ex vivo culture conditions.
Strong GFP expression is observed in the skeletal muscle,
pancreas, heart, and kidney. Bone-marrow-derived mesen￾chymal stromal cells (MSCs), hepatocytes, and islet cells of
the pancreas also show detectable expression, with a
unique pattern. Moreover, the cloned pigs demonstrate
normal growth and fertility, and the introduced GFP gene
is stably transmitted to subsequent generations. These
GFP-expressing Jinhua pigs can be used as new cellular or
tissue light resources for biological imaging in preclinical
research fields such as tissue engineering, experimental re￾generative medicine, and transplantation. These pigs are
also a useful source for imaging in the field of stem cell re￾search. A clinical protocol for intra-articular injections into
massive meniscal defects has been tested by using synovial
stem cells obtained from GFP-transgenic animals [23].
Research using micromini pigs
A very small pig, termed a ‘micromini pig’ is likley to prove
suitable for preclinical safety evaluations of new agents
(Figure 4A). Although several years might be needed to
perform comparative studies of drug toxicology among
dogs, monkeys, and pigs, we believe that these micromini
pigs will be suitable for use in studies of advanced medical
treatments. We have great interest in regenerative medi￾cine and are focusing on the micromini pig model to test
its benefits and drawbacks in this field. Because of their
moderate body size, micromini pigs are suitable for testing
systemic injections of MSCs. This is not the case in
rodents, which are too small, and miniature pigs, for which
more time is required for stem cell expansion in vitro.
MSCs are expected to have tissue-regenerative, immuno￾modulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects [24].
However, a major risk of MSC therapy is pulmonary em￾bolism in the very early phases of treatment. It is important
to note that MSCs suspended in saline or culture media eas￾ily become sedimentary and aggregate in less than one hour
(Figure 4B); this might be related to the risk of embolism￾related complications after intravenous injection. A preclin￾ical study using the micromini pig clearly showed that sys￾temic injection of MSCs (1 × 107
cells/kg, about 3.0 × 108
cells/
pig) immersed in normal saline without heparin (200 mL, in￾fusion time 40 minutes) caused the pulmonary arterial pres￾sure to increase by more than 30 mm Hg, as determined by
monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter (Figure 4C).
However, by using a solution that we developed in a liver is￾chemia–reperfusion model in pigs, we found that allogenic
MSC transplantation had a therapeutic effect (manuscript in
Figure 4 Cell transplantation models in the pig. A) Micromini pig. B) Cell mixture solution in an infusion pack after one hour. Arrow shows

preparation). Additionally, for the purpose of these proce￾dures, the pig’s anatomy is suffiicently similar to that of
humans for X-ray to be useful in monitoring blood flow to
the liver [See Additional file 5: Movie S5]. Thus, the micro￾mini pig was suitable for the development of an MSC￾aggregation inhibition solution and is useful for evaluating
treatment effects and creating a surgical model that mimics
the human one.
Conclusions
We have described our 10 years of experience with the de￾velopment and use of several porcine models as biomed￾ical research tools. Development of disease models in pigs
is essential for further expanding the use of pigs in effect￾ive preclinical experiments, because few spontaneous dis￾ease models are available in pigs, unlike in dogs. Recent
advances in genetic technology in pigs have shown that
these experimental animals are now suitable, mature bio￾medical models.
