Abstract
Background: Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder highlighted
byiron-overload. Two popular mutations in HFE, p.C282Y and p.H63D, have been discovered and
found to associate with HH in different ethnic backgrounds. p.C282Y and p.H63D diagnosis is
usually made byrestriction enzyme analysis. However, the use of this technique is largelylimited to
research laboratories because they are relativelyexpensive, time-consuming, and difficult to
transform into a high throughput format.
Methods: Single nucleotide variations in target DNA sequences can be readily identified using
molecular beacon fluorescent probes. These are quenched probes with loop and hairpin structure,
and they become fluorescent upon specific target recognition. We developed high throughput
homogeneous real-time PCR assays using molecular beacon technology, to genotype p.C282Y and
p.H63D variants. Representative samples of different genotypes for these variants were assayed by
restriction enzyme analysis and direct sequencing as bench mark methods for comparison with the
newly developed molecular beacon-based real-time PCR assay.
Results: Complete concordance was achieved by all three assay formats. Homozygotes (mutant
and wildtype) and heterozygotes were readily differentiated by the allele specific molecular beacons
as reported by the associated fluorophore in the real-time assay developed in this study.
Additionally, these assays were used in a high throughput format to establish the allele frequency
of C282Y and H63D in Saudis for the first time.
Conclusion: These assays may be reliably applied as a diagnostic test or large scale method for
population screening.
Background
Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal
recessive disorder highlighted byiron-overload [1]. HH
was recognized more than a century ago as a condition
with three symptoms: diabetes, skin bronzing, and cirrho￾sis [2]. In Caucasians, HH affects 3–8 in every 1000 indi￾viduals, with an approximately 10% prevalence of
heterozygous carriers [3]. The molecular basis for HH was
completely unknown untilthe identification in 1996 of a
gene onchromosome 6p, designated HLA-H, subse￾quently renamed HFE [4]. A cysteine-to-tyrosine substitu￾tion at position282 in the HFE protein (p.C282Y), has

been observed in the majorityof HH patients, with fre￾quencies ranging from 64% to 100% in subjects (fromdif￾ferent geographic areas) who have hemochromatosis [5-
7]. A substitution of histidine by aspartic acid at position
63 (p.H63D) in the HFE protein, was also linked to an
additional 1–10% of HH cases [5]. Large population￾based studies are required to definitively establish the
prevalence of these mutations on an ethnic and or geo￾graphic basis. A recently described third mutation, which
substitutes cysteine for serine at position65 (p.S65C) of
the HFE protein, is enriched in HH individuals who have
a mild form of the disease and lack the p.C282Y or
p.H63D mutations [8]. The overall impact of this third
mutation is currently unclear. Whilst many other muta￾tions of HFE associated with the hemochromatosis phe￾notype have been described, they appear to be rare or
"private" mutations [9].
The diagnosis of hemochromatosis was previously based
on a combined clinical and laboratory assessment includ￾ing physical examination, elevated transferrin saturation,
and serum ferritin. Pedigree studies have boosted the
acceptance of HH genetic screening in several countries
[10]. The most established screening test for HH is trans￾ferrin saturation. The sensitivity of transferrin saturation
for the diagnosis of HH has been reported to be 94%
based on a population screening study from Busselton,
Australia [11]. Today, the diagnosis of HH has shifted
from clinical symptoms and biochemical assessment
towards genetic testing. Genetic testing for HFE mutations
now plays a central role in confirming the clinical diagno￾sis of HH. Several molecular methods have been used to
screen for the common HH mutations, p.C282Y and
p.H63D. The methods include allele-specific oligonucle￾otide hybridization (ASO) [12], restriction enzyme (RE)
analysis [4], and the invader assay [13]. High throughput
ASO methods require up to two days to complete, include
multiple post PCR steps and often use radioactive rea￾gents, all factors likely to discourage application of this
format. RE also requires several post PCR steps including
an overnight digestion and analysis of ethidium bromide
stained gels, and can potentially lead to PCR contamina￾tion as a result of excess handling. The invader assay on
the other hand, is an isothermal high throughput assay,
but requires complicated design of both signal and
invader probes which must work in tandem and involve
multi-step intermolecular events. Genotypes are assigned
after determination of the net wild-type/variant signal
ratios, which can potentially lead to genotyping miscalls.
The use of these techniques have enabled several HFE
population studies, however, these techniques remain￾limited to research laboratories as they are relativelyex￾pensive, time-consuming, and in some cases difficult to
transform into a robust high throughput format.
Molecular beacons are single-stranded oligonucleotide
probes with a stem-and-loop hairpin structure [14]. The
loop domain of the molecular beacon is complementary
to the target sequence and contains the mutation site usu￾ally embedded centrally. The molecular beacon is labeled
with a flourophore at one end and a quencher, 4'-(4-
dimethylaminophenylazo) benzoic acid (DABCYL), at
the other end. When the specific target is encountered, the
molecular beacon forms a hybrid with the target leading
to conformational changes that position the flourophore
away from the quencher. As a result, fluorescence of the
molecular beacon is restored signaling presence of the
associated allele. Under optimal conditions, instability of
mismatched hybrids increases the specificity of molecular
beacons, making them the perfect probes for single nucle￾otide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping or for detection of
point/small mutations. Molecular beacons can each be
conjugated to different fluorophores enabling simultane￾ous detection of any genotype in a closed tube homogene￾ous assay [14-16]. In addition, they eliminate the need for
agarose gel analysis of PCR products because the entire
assay fromamplification to detection is performed in the
same microwell, allow SNPs to be analyzedin less than 2
hours and genotyping calls can be reliably automated.
In this report we describe the design and validation of 2
molecular beacon-based real-time PCR assays for the
detection of the common HH mutations, p.C282Y and
p.H63D.
Methods
DNA samples
A total of 23 samples of known genotypes for the p.C282Y
and p.H63D mutations were selected and anonymized
prior to being used in assay development and validation.
The samples originated from patients referred to our lab￾oratory for HFE genotyping. Routinely, these samples are
assayed using a restriction digestion based methodology.
For population studies, we utilized a total of 540 random,
anonymized newborn dried blood spots (DBS) as a
source of template DNA. The neonatal DBS are routinely
sent from multiple birth centers across Saudi Arabia to the
National Laboratory for Newborn Screening in our insti￾tution. The likelihood of these samples originating from
closely related subjects is virtually negligible but cannot
be completely excluded. Sample collection and enroll￾ment in this study was approved by our institutional
review board (IRB) according to guidelines of the Declara￾tion of Helsinki.
Whole genome amplification (WGA)
DNA was amplified from dried blood spots using a mod￾ified WGA method [17]. A Repli_g 100 kit (Qiagen, Valen￾cia, CA) was used for amplification. In brief, 1.2 mm
punch biopsies were derived from the dried blood spots

using a Harris Micro Punch (Whatman Inc, USA), and dis￾pensed into 96-well plates. The punch biopsies were then
soaked with 20 µl of PBS, followed by addition of 20 µl of
lysis solution A according to the manufacturers recom￾mendations. The plates were allowed to sit on ice for 10
minutes to allow release of nuclei from the discs. Each
sample was then neutralized by adding 20 µl of solution
B. From each lysis mix, 2 µl was transferred to 8 µl of the
WGA reaction mix present in each well of a 96-well micro
plate, bringing the final reaction volume to 10 µl per sam￾ple. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 16 hr at 30°C
on an MJ Research thermocycler (MJ Research, Water￾town, MA, USA)and terminated by heating to 65°C for 5
min. Dilutions from the crude amplification mixture were
directly used for genotyping.
HFE genotyping by restriction enzyme digestion
Restriction digestion was carried out as described [4].
Briefly, two amplicons encompassing the p.C282Y and
p.H63D mutation sites were generated by PCR prior to
restriction digestion analysis. Amplification was per￾formed in total volume of 25 µl. PCR reactions were car￾ried out using an MJ Research thermocycler (MJ Research,
Watertown, MA, USA). Each PCR reaction contained 100
ng gDNA, 1X PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM
dNTPs, 0.5 µM forward/reverse primers, and 1U Taq
polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The primers
TGGCAAGGGTAAACAGATCC and CTCAGCTCCT￾GGCTCTCAT were used to generate a 357 bp genomic
fragment that contained the c.845G>A mutation site in
the HFE gene. Primers ACATGGTTAAGGCCTGTTGC and
CTTGCTGTGGTTGTGATTTTCC were used to generate a
294 bp genomic fragment that contains the c.187C>G
mutation site in the HFE gene. In each instance, amplifi￾cation was performed after an initial activation step for
Taq polymerase of 15 minutes at 95°C followed by 35
cycles each of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 56°C, and 1 min at
72°C. A final extension step of 10 min at 72°C was also
used. Following PCR, restriction enzyme digestion reac￾tions were set up as follows: 10 µl PCR product, 2 µl
restriction enzyme (RE), and 1X RE buffer. RsaI (10 u/µl),
and MboI (10 u/µl) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), were
used to digest the c.845G>A and c.187C>G mutation-con￾taining fragments respectively. Digestion products were
run on a 2% agarose gel for 30 min at 120V.
PCR and direct sequencing
Amplicons encompassing the p.C282Y and p.H63D
mutation sites of HFE were generated by PCR amplifica￾tion using gDNA samples. Primer pairs used generated
388 bp and 486 bp fragments for p.C282Y and p.H63D
respectively. Sequencing reactions were performed using
an Amersham ET Dye Terminator sequencing kit (Amer￾sham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) following the
manufacturers instructions. Sequencing reactions were
desalted and unincorporated nucleotides removed using
ethanol precipitation, and then re-suspended in a forma￾mide EDTA solution for injection on a MegaBACE 1000
capillary electrophoresis system (Molecular Dynamics,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Sequence analysis was performed
using the SeqMan module of the Lasergene software pack￾age (DNA Star Inc, Madison, WI, USA) by comparing
alignments of multiple samples with each other and a
Genbank reference sequence (U60319).
Genotyping by molecular beacon assays
Real-time small scale PCR assays were performed in 0.2
ml clear flat top tubes (Phenix, Hayward, CA, USA) for use
with the Rotor Gene 3000 (Corbett Research, Sydney,
Australia). For large scale assays, 384-well clear optical
reaction plates were used with the ABI Prism 7900 HT
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). PCR mixtures consisted of 1X qPCR mastermix
plus (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), 0.5 µM forward/
reverse primers, 0.25 µM of each molecular beacon probe,
and 20 ng of gDNA template. Reaction tubes were sub￾jected to an initial 2 min incubation at 50°C (Uracil-N￾glycosylase will eliminate carry over amplicon contami￾nants in this step), then a 10 min incubation at 95°C for
Taq polymerase activation, followed by 40 PCR cycles.
Cycling conditions were 95°C denaturation for 10 sec,
58°C annealing for 30 sec, and 72°C extension for 30 sec.
A negative control (deionised water) was included in each
assay. The following allele-specific molecular beacons and
primers were designed and used in the assays (all were
sourced from Proligo, Paris, France):

In the beacon sequences, underlined lower case bases
refer to the complementary arms. Bolded and capitalized
bases represent the allelic variants at each locus. For the
beacons design, we have used mfold [18] for appropriate
probe folding. Genotype calling of DNA samples was
determined by measuring the threshold cycle (Ct) value
for each sample. Fluorescence data was collected during
each annealing step throughout cycling at which point the
molecular beacon is bound to its complementary target
amplicon. Results were displayed as an amplification plot
for fluorescence versus cycle number. The threshold cycle
is the cycle at which the fluorescent signal is first reported
above the set baseline fluorescence. The baseline fluores￾cence was set at 10% above the average fluorescence value
of PCR cycles 1 through 18. Genotyping of DNA samples
was based on positive threshold cycles for FAM, TET, or
both. Positive Ct values were usually detected between
cycles 25–30, and indicated the presence of specific
allele(s).
Results
C282Y and H63D genotyping of HFE by PCR/restriction 
enzyme analysis
Both of p.C282Y and p.H63D mutations alter restriction￾enzyme sites, providing a method for genotyping.
c.845G>A creates a recognition site for RsaI; c.187C>G
abolishes the DNA sequence recognition site for MboI.
RsaI was used for restriction analysis of an amplicon (357
bp undigested; Figure 1A, lane 2) containing the p.C282Y
mutation site of HFE. Representative restriction analysis
using the control samples is shown in Figure 1. Following
RsaI digestion a homozygous wild type sample (GG) pro￾duces two fragments (Figure 1A, lane 3: 250 and 107 bp),
whereas a homozygous mutant sample (AA) results in
three fragments (Figure 1A, lane 4: 250, 78, and 29 bp).
For heterozygotes, four fragments (Figure 1A, lane 5: 250,
107, 78, and 29 bp) were present following RsaI diges￾tions. Similarly MboI was used for restriction analysis of
an amplicon (294 bp undigested; Figure 1B, lane 2) con￾taining the p.H63D mutation site of HFE. Following MboI
digestion a homozygous wildtype sample (CC) produces
three fragments (Figure 1B, lane 3: 138, 99 and 57 bp),
whereas a homozygous mutant sample (GG) generates
two fragments (Figure 1B, lane 4: 237 and 57 bp). For het￾erozygote sample (CG) four fragments (Figure 1B, lane 5:
237, 138, 99, and 57 bp) were present following diges￾tion.
Direct sequencing of HFE amplicons containing the 
p.C282Y and p.H63D sites
Direct sequencing of amplicons containing the p.C282Y
and p.H63D sites of HFE were performed on both strands
for all 23 patients and three control samples. Sequencing
results of all 23 samples and the controls were 100% con￾cordant with that achieved using PCR and restriction anal￾ysis.

p.C282Y and p.H63D genotyping by molecular-beacon 
based real-time PCR assays
p.C282Y and p.H63D genotyping was carried out by using
two independent molecular beacon-based homogeneous
assays. Representative results of assays for C282Y and
p.H63D using sequence validated controls are shown in
Figures 2 and 3 respectively. These results were generated
using the Corbett 3000 system; identical profiles are also
observed when the assay is run on the ABI Prism 7900 HT
sequence detection system. Ct values were detected in
these assays usually between cycles 25 and 30, and indi￾cate the presence of specific allele(s) depending on the
positive signal(s) that are detected. For both of these
assays, wild type and variant allele-detecting molecular
beacons were labeled with FAM and TET respectively. FAM
channel only positive signal indicated a homozygous wild
type genotype. Conversely TET channel only positive sig￾nal indicated a homozygous mutant genotype. FAM posi￾tive/TET positive channels indicate a heterozygote
genotype. p.C282Y and p.H63D real-time assay cycling
parameters were optimized to be identical thus permitting
simultaneous analysis of both genotypes, albeit in inde￾pendent reactions. Genotyping of p.C282Y and p.H63D
variants was accomplished by real-time PCR amplifica￾tion of C282Y- and H63D-containg amplicons in the pres￾ence of the allele-specific molecular beacons for these
variants. Relative fluorescence was monitored using the
Rotor Gene 3000 real-time thermal cycler, and represent￾ative genotyping results are shown in Figures 2 (p.C282Y)
and 3 (p.H63D). Using this real-time PCR method, geno￾typing of all 23 test samples was in complete concordance
with the results achieved using restriction enzyme analysis
and direct sequencing.
High throughput population genotyping for p.C282Y and 
p.H63D
Here we analyzed a total of 540 DNA samples obtained
from anonymized newborn dry bloodspots. DNA was
amplified from these spots using whole genome amplifi￾cation (WGA) technology. WGA provides a comprehen￾sive whole genome coverage and minimal loci bias [19].
The WGA method provides unlimited quantities of DNA
directly from a variety of samples types including dried
blood spots. p.C282Y and p.H63D genotyping was facil￾itated by the use of the two molecular beacon assays
which we developed and that were readily applicable for
genotyping of a large number of samples. Using this
approach on a cost per sample basis in respect of both
reagents and time the molecular beacon based assay was
more economical than restriction enzyme analysis or
direct sequencing. This is based upon a requirement for
1,000 or more assays which introduces an economy of
scale with respect to the synthesis of molecular beacons
and assumes availability of real-time PCR instrumenta￾tion. Based upon these numbers, the reagent cost of each
of the beacon assays described here. has been calculated
at <US$ 1.0, This is compared to a 3–4 fold more reagent
cost when alternative methodology such as RE or
sequencing is considered and reflects the single step bea￾con procedure as opposed to the multi-step nature of
alternatives. Clearly the single step beacon procedure is
similarly advantageous when viewed in terms of techni￾cian time. The overall p.C282Y genotyping resulted in no
mutant alleles being detected as all subjects were
homozygous (GG) for the wildtype allele. This result
indicates the mutant or variant A allele to be very rare
(frequency < 0.001) in the Saudi population. On the
other hand, p.H63D genotyping analysis showed geno￾types as follows: 380 (70.4%) subjects were wildtype
homozygotes (CC), 129 (23.9%) subjects were heterozy￾gotes (CG) and 31 (5.7%) were homozygote mutants
(GG). Based on these genotypes, the Saudi allele frequen￾cies are 0.823 and 0.177 for the normal (C) and risk (G)

alleles respectively at this locus. Based on the risk allele
frequencies observed in this study, C282Y mutation (<
0.001) was comparable to that reported in Bulgaria and
lower than all other population studies published thus
far. The H63D (0.177) was higher than most of the Euro￾pean populations, Hispanics, Asians, but less than that
observed in Bulgarians, Spanish, and Portuguese [20].
Discussion
Three genotyping methods were compared in this study
independently using DNA samples representing all possi￾ble genotypes of the p.C282Y and p.H63D mutations of
HFE. We have developed and validated two new molecu￾lar beacon-based real-time PCR genotyping assays, and
performed a head to head comparison against the restric￾tion enzyme digestion and direct sequencing reference
methods. Even though HFE genotyping in other laborato￾ries is already automated and does not provide a major
technical obstacle, molecular beacon-based real-time PCR
genotyping may provide a cheaper and more efficient
alternative, particularly for large studies.
Both the new real-time PCR assays provided unambigu￾ous genotyping in total concordance with reference meth￾ods. These real-time assays were simple, inexpensive, fast,
and less labor intensive in relation to restriction digestion￾based mutation analysesand direct sequencing. Therefore,
the closed-tube allelic discrimination assays developed by
this study have several advantages over other mutation
detection techniques: a) the hairpin-shaped molecular
beacons are extremely specific in distinguishing single
base-pair variants; b) there is significant reduction of post￾PCR cross-contamination risk, and c) the technology can
readily be adapted to a high-throughput format (e.g., 96
or 384-well assays). For this purpose, we used the molec￾ular beacon based assay for analysis of 540 random ano￾nymized DNA samples derived from Saudi newborn
subjects, using the 384-well genotyping format and the
ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detection system. Genotyp￾ing could be performed in less than two hours per run
allowing the analysis of thousands of DNA samples per
day. Such a true high throughput setting is essential to the
performance of large population-based studies for the
establishment of allele frequencies. The establishment of
population based allele frequencies for common disease
related mutations or variants are a necessary prelude to
the clinical use of genotyping of these loci.
Population HFE studies for most of the world regions are
missing, and previous genotyping studies indicated that
siblings of non-expressing (asymptomatic) homozygotes
have been found to have iron overload [10,21]. In the
Saudi population incidence of the HFE A (or risk allele of
P.C282Y), which is the primary mutation underlying HH
in other populations, was extremely low (<0.001). Alter￾nately, incidence (0.177) of the C or risk allele underlying
the HFE p.H63D mutation was relatively common based
upon reports in other populations [4,22,23]. Collectively
the data suggests that the Saudi population is either at low
risk for HH or that novel mutations of HFE may play a
role in this population. The high incidence of p.H63D
would elevate risk but does not have as strong an associa￾tion with HH as p.C282Y [11,24-26]. Sequencing of HFE
in clinically well characterized patients of Saudi origin
with HH is indicated to clearly establish the role of
p.H63D or novel HFE mutations in this population.
Conclusion
The two assays which we have developed and presented
here possess adequate target specificity and are readily
performed in a high throughput format. These assays may
be reliably applied as a diagnostic test or large scale
method to facilitate world-wide population based studies.
