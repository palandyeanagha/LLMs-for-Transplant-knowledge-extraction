Background and aims: Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) may improve intestinal absorption in short bowel
syndrome (SBS) patients with an end jejunostomy. Teduglutide (ALX-0600), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV
resistant GLP-2 analogue, prolongs the intestinotrophic properties of GLP-2 in animal models. The safety
and effect of teduglutide were investigated in SBS patients with and without a colon in continuity.
Methods: Teduglutide was given subcutaneously for 21 days once or twice daily to 16 SBS patients in the
per protocol investigational group, 10 with end jejunostomy (doses of 0.03 (n = 2), 0.10 (n = 5), or 0.15
(n = 3) mg/kg/day), one with ,50% colon in continuity (dose 0.03 mg/kg/day), and five with >50%
colon in continuity (dose 0.10 mg/kg/day). Nutrient balance studies, D-xylose tests, and intestinal mucosa
biopsies were performed at baseline, on the last three days of treatment, and after three weeks of follow
up. Pre-study fasting native GLP-2 levels were determined for the five patients with >50% colon in
continuity.
Results: Pooled across groups and compared with baseline, teduglutide increased absolute (+743
(477) g/day; p,0.001) and relative (+22 (16)%; p,0.001) wet weight absorption, urine weight (+555
(485) g/day; p,0.001), and urine sodium excretion (+53 (40) mmol/day; p,0.001). Teduglutide
decreased faecal wet weight (2711 (734) g/day; p = 0.001) and faecal energy excretion (2808
(1453) kJ/day (2193 (347) kcal/day); p = 0.040). In SBS patients with end jejunostomy, teduglutide
significantly increased villus height (+38 (45)%; p = 0.030), crypt depth (+22 (18)%; p = 0.010), and
mitotic index (+115 (108)%; p = 0.010). Crypt depth and mitotic index did not change in colonic biopsies
from SBS patients with colon in continuity. The most common side effects were enlargement of the stoma
nipple and mild lower leg oedema. The improvements in intestinal absorption and decreases in faecal
excretion noted after treatment had reversed after the drug free follow up period. A controlled study with a
more robust design is ongoing in order to determine the optimal dosage of teduglutide for SBS patients to
achieve the maximal effect and utility of this drug in clinical practice.
Conclusion: Teduglutide, at three dose levels for 21 days, was safe and well tolerated, intestinotrophic,
and significantly increased intestinal wet weight absorption in SBS patients with an end jejunostomy or a
colon in continuity.
T
he estimated annual prevalence of short bowel syndrome
(SBS) patients with non-malignant disease requiring
home parenteral nutrition is at least 40 per million of the
US population.1 2 In Europe, the point prevalence has been
reported to be between 0.6 and 12.7 in various countries.3
SBS usually results from surgical resection of the small
bowel for conditions such as Crohn’s disease, mesenteric
infarction, congenital anomalies, and multiple strictures due
to adhesions or radiation. SBS patients suffer from mal￾absorption that may lead to malnutrition, dehydration, and
weight loss. Some patients can maintain their protein and
energy balance through hyperphagia; more rarely they can
sustain fluid and electrolyte compensation to become
independent of parenteral fluid.
Although long term parenteral nutrition (PN) is life saving
in patients with intestinal failure, it is expensive, impairs
quality of life,4 and is associated with serious complications
such as catheter sepsis, venous occlusions, and liver failure.5
Treatments that amplify absolute intestinal absorption, and
eliminate or minimise the need for PN, have great potential
significance to SBS patients.
The endogenous meal stimulated hormone, glucagon-like
peptide 2 (GLP-2), raises considerable interest for SBS
patients. GLP-2 acts to slow gastric emptying,6 reduce gastric
secretions,7 increase intestinal blood flow,8 and stimulate
growth of the small and large intestine.9 In animal studies,
GLP-2 administration induces mucosal epithelial prolifera￾tion in the stomach, and small and large bowel by
stimulation of crypt cell proliferation9 and inhibition of
enterocyte apoptosis.10
SBS patients with end jejunostomy and no colon have
limited meal stimulated GLP-2 secretion11 due to removal of
GLP-2 secreting L cells which are located primarily in the
terminal ileum and colon. GLP-2 deficiency could aggravate
gastric hypersecretion, rapid intestinal transit, and lack of
intestinal adaptation observed in these SBS patients.
Jeppesen et al have described benefit in an open label study
using pharmacological doses of native GLP-2 in SBS
jejunostomy patients.12 There was significant improvement
in intestinal wet weight absorption and a more modest
improvement in energy absorption that led to an increase in

body weight, lean body mass, and a rise in urinary creatinine
excretion.
In contrast, SBS patients with a colon in continuity have
elevated basal and meal stimulated endogenous GLP-2. The
potential benefit of pharmacological doses of GLP-2 in these
patients has not been studied.
The half-life of native GLP-2 is approximately seven
minutes due to enzymatic degradation by dipeptidyl pepti￾dase IV (DPP-IV). A DPP-IV resistant recombinant human
GLP-2 analogue, teduglutide, was developed by replacing
alanine with glycine in position 2 of the peptide. This is the
first study of the safety and effect of three dose levels of
teduglutide given for 21 days to SBS patients with either end
jejunostomy or colon in continuity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients
Study subjects were recruited from centres in the US and
Denmark that care for patients receiving PN. All patients had
undergone extensive resection of the small bowel without
any surgical resection of the stomach, duodenum, or
pancreas.
Study inclusion criteria were: over 18 years of age;
diagnosis of SBS that could be secondary to Crohn’s disease,
volvulus, injury, or vascular ischaemia; remnant small bowel
of ,150 cm; no clinical suspicion of active inflammatory
bowel disease or fistulas; no history of radiation enteritis or
sprue; no alcohol or drug abuse; no significant renal, hepatic,
or cardiac diseases; no glutamine for at least four weeks prior
to screening; no growth factors; and no participation in any
clinical trial within three months of screening (except for the
use of teduglutide in patients in the rechallenge group). SBS
patients with >50% colon in continuity had a demonstrated
faecal weight exceeding 1 kg/day and faecal energy loss
exceeding 2 MJ/day (478 kcal/day).
Women of childbearing age had to have a negative blood
b-human chorionic gonadotropin test before inclusion in the
study and use effective contraceptives during the study.
Usual medications such as proton pump inhibitors, codeine,
loperamide, and oral and parenteral supplements were kept
constant. Local ethics committees or institutional review
boards approved the protocol. Procedures were in accordance
with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of
1964, as modified by the 48th World Medical Association in
1996. Each eligible patient gave written informed consent
prior to the study.
Study protocol
This was an open label pilot study to determine the safety and
effect of teduglutide in patients with SBS. The patient’s
history was reviewed and a physical examination performed
to determine eligibility before inclusion in the study.
Estimated residual small bowel and colon lengths were
determined by reviewing operative reports and available
radiographic studies. Eligible patients were admitted as
inpatients to hospital wards or General Clinic Research
Centres (GCRC) on three separate occasions, 18 days apart,
for the last four days and three nights of the baseline period
and at the end of the treatment and follow up periods.
Treatment consisted of recombinant teduglutide (supplied by
NPS Allelix, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) formulated as a
lyophilised powder with L-histidine, mannitol, and mono￾basic and dibasic sodium phosphate (lot 8502901). Water
was added to reconstitute the drug for administration by
subcutaneous injections in the abdomen or thigh. Twelve SBS
patients with jejunostomy received 0.03 mg/kg/day (n = 3),
0.10 mg/kg/day (n = 5), or 0.15 mg/kg/day (n = 4) once daily.
Doses were chosen to examine dose response in SBS patients
over a range of doses expected to provide clinical benefit.
Single doses up to 10 mg (equivalent to approximately
0.10 mg/kg) were shown to be safe and well tolerated when
administered to normal volunteers (previous study, data not
presented). Based on the pharmacological, toxicological, and
pharmacokinetic profile available when the protocol was
prepared, doses of teduglutide 25% log above (0.15 mg/kg)
and 50% log below (0.03 mg/kg) the 0.10 mg/kg dose were
included in this pilot study. Five patients from the two
highest dosing groups were rechallenged with a divided dose
(0.05 mg/kg or 0.075 mg/kg every 12 hours) at least three
months after their initial participation to investigate antibody
formation and to evaluate twice daily dosing. Five SBS
patients with >50% colon in continuity received teduglutide
0.10 mg/kg/day once daily. This dose was given because it
was expected to provide clinical benefit based on animal data
and was tested in patients with end jejunostomy.
During each inpatient period, patients underwent 72 hour
nutrient balance and D-xylose absorption studies, and a
proximal or distal bowel endoscopy to ascertain the condition
of the intestinal mucosa and obtain biopsy samples (not
repeated in rechallenge patients). In jejunostomy patients,
biopsies were obtained through the jejunostomy stoma or by
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In patients with colon in
continuity, colorectal biopsies were obtained. Teduglutide
treatment began on day 1 (immediately after the baseline
period) and continued once daily (or twice daily in
rechallenge patients) for 21 days. On the first and last day
of dosing, all patients had blood collections for plasma levels
and pharmacokinetic parameters (submitted for publication,
results to be presented separately13), and to test for any
antibodies to teduglutide or Escherichia coli protein. Whereas
pretreatment antibodies to teduglutide were not expected
and served as a control, teduglutide was recombinantly
produced in E coli and pre-existing antibodies to E coli were
possible. Patients were monitored for safety (adverse events,
physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, laboratory results,
and injection site examinations) during the inpatient periods
and during outpatient visits on days 7 and 14.
The 72 hour nutrient balance studies were completed with
each patient eating their usual diet, calculated from a seven
day food diary completed by the patient during the screening
period. It was intended that dietary intake should be fixed
during balance studies and the study did not seek to evaluate
the effects of teduglutide on spontaneous dietary intake.
During the 72 hour balance periods, all oral intake (duplicate
meals and beverages and declined food), faecal/stomal
output, and urine were collected and weighed. All stool
samples were refrigerated during the collection period. Stools
and diets were separately homogenised and analysed by MDS
Clinical Trial Laboratories for energy content (bomb calori￾metry),14 nitrogen (macro-Kjeldahl’s method),15 fat (gravi￾metric technique),16 and sodium and potassium (atomic
absorption).17
D-xylose was used to test intestinal carbohydrate absorp￾tion.18 After an overnight fast, patients drank a test solution
of 25 g D-xylose in 200 ml of distilled water over a
2–3 minute period. A blood sample was taken at two hours
and urine collected for five hours following ingestion.
Morphological analysis
Endoscopic examinations were performed in each subject at
completion of baseline, treatment, and follow up phases.
Tissue samples for measurement of villus height and crypt
depth were prepared and analysed in a blinded fashion by the
same pathologist. Villus height and crypt depth were
measured using light microscopy (eyepiece micrometer) as
the mean of 10 well oriented villi and crypts. The number of
mitotic figures per 100 crypt epithelial cells was calculated.

Body weight
Body weight was measured on a levelled platform scale every
morning before breakfast after patients emptied their bladder
and stoma bag. Mean body weight was calculated for four
consecutive days.
Statistics
A test for normality was performed justifying parametric
statistical testing in this study. Using the SAS (version 8.2;
SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) statistical program,
a Student’s paired t test was employed that compared
treatment with baseline values, and follow up with baseline
values. Absolute intestinal absorption was calculated as
equivalent to the difference between ingestion and excretion,
and relative absorption as (diet2faecal)/diet6100%. No
comparisons were made between patients on different doses
or with different anatomy due to the limited number of
patients in the study. Data are expressed as mean (SD). A
value of p,0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Patients
Eighteen SBS patients (11 females, seven males) were
enrolled in this open label, multicentre, dose ranging pilot
study. Four US sites recruited six (two, two, one, one)
patients and one Danish site recruited 12 patients. Of the 18
patients, 17 patients received teduglutide; one female patient
was discontinued prior to treatment due to intercurrent
disease. Baseline characteristics of these 17 patients are given
in table 1. Patient 09 experienced a long septic episode and
was excluded from the effect analysis due to this destabilisa￾tion. A total of 16 SBS patients comprised the overall per
protocol investigational group (group 1). These 16 patients
were subdivided into an end jejunostomy group of 10 (group
2) and a >50% colon in continuity group of five (group 3).
There were originally 11 jejunostomy patients but patient 03
was found on biopsy to have a remnant segment of colon,
later estimated to be 30%. This individual was kept in group 1
but was not included in any subgroup analysis. As judged
from analysis of duplicate meals adjusted for declined food,
some patients had better dietary consistency than others. It
was intended that dietary intake was fixed during the
balance studies and the study did not seek to evaluate the
effects of teduglutide on spontaneous dietary intake. Patients
who had an oral food intake where the dietary wet weight
and energy content at treatment did not differ by more than
10% from baseline values were termed ‘‘high dietary
compliance’’. Ten patients had a high dietary compliance
(,10% variability from baseline value), five with end
jejunostomy and five with >50% colon in continuity (group
4). Five end jejunostomy patients who received teduglutide
0.10 or 0.15 mg/kg/day as a single dose were later rechal￾lenged with a divided dose (0.05 or 0.075 mg/kg twice daily).
Their first single dose treatment (group 5) was compared
with the second divided dose treatment (group 6).
Of the 17 patients treated, three with colon in continuity
did not require either PN or parenteral fluids, two end
jejunostomy patients required fluids only, and 12 patients
required both PN and fluids (table 1).
In the 16 SBS patients where the treatment effect was
analysed (group 1), mean age was 49.5 (13.0) years (range
27–74), mean weight was 58.4 (12.4) kg (range 38.9–79.2),
mean height was 168 (7) cm (range 158–180), and mean
body mass index was 20.7 (3.9) kg/m2 (range 15.0–26.9).
Twelve of the 16 SBS patients used antidiarrhoeal medica￾tions, and 14 patients used antisecretory medications,
including one (patient No 12) that took octreotide.
Compliance
Jejunostomy patient No 03, who was found to have a
segment of colon in continuity, and patient 15C, known to
have colon in continuity, did not complete the follow up
period. Drug compliance (counting the number of returned
vials) was complete in all patients participating during the

nutrient balance periods. During the 21 day treatment period,
drug compliance was complete, except in one patient with
colon in continuity who administered the full dose for
15 days, half doses for two days, and no dose for four days.
Of the five rechallenged patients, two administered for
21 days twice daily, two administered for 20.5 days twice
daily, and one administered for 19.5 days twice daily.
Safety results
All patients were monitored for safety. There were no deaths
and no withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs). Four of the
treated patients reported five serious AEs which included
dehydration, sepsis, and catheter related infection. None of
the serious AEs were judged to be related to the study drug.
Dehydration is common in conditions with fever and changes
in oral intake. Two patients (patient 09 (table 1) 0.15 mg/kg
once daily and patient 6R (table 1) 0.05 mg/kg twice daily)
became dehydrated. The first patient had sepsis and
dehydration that began two days after completing the dosing
portion of the study. The second patient had dehydration that
began during the screening period (two days prior to the
dosing portion of the study) and resolved six days later. The
incidence of AEs was similar between groups. The most
common AEs were oedema of the lower limbs (7/16 patients,
44%), and localised swelling of the jejunostomy nipple (7/10
patients, 70%). All five rechallenged patients (group 6)
showed this AE at least once in both 21 day treatment

cycles. Other AEs included headache (4/16 patients, 25%) and
abdominal pain (3/16 patients, 19%), two had Crohn’s
disease and colon in continuity. Examination of the jejunal
or colon biopsy samples did not reveal any cases of
reactivation of Crohn’s disease. Three patients had minor
injection site reactions (single events of bruising, induration,
rash; four events of erythema). No clinically significant
abnormal laboratory values were identified in relation to
teduglutide treatment. No safety concerns were raised from
vital signs or ECGs. No antibodies to teduglutide were
detected. One patient had a relative E coli protein antibody
titre of 1:1624, and six patients had relative titres between
1:107 and 1:228 after treatment.
Endogenous GLP-2 levels
For patients with >50% colon in continuity, fasting
concentrations of endogenous GLP-2 were measured prior
to administration of teduglutide. For four of the five subjects,
their concentrations were closer to the fed state for healthy
fasting volunteers (fasted 15 (2) pmol/l; fed 61 (9) pmol/l).19
Levels for the five subjects were 16, 27, 37, 41, and 73 pmol/l.
Neither baseline nor endogenous meal stimulated GLP-2
secretions were evaluated in SBS patients with end jejun￾ostomy in this study.
Effects of teduglutide
Wet weight
Figure 1 illustrates faecal wet weight, intestinal wet weight
absorption, and urine weight in individual patients in group 1
at baseline, during treatment, and at follow up. A 21 day
treatment with teduglutide significantly decreased faecal wet
weight compared with baseline values in the entire group of
SBS patients (group 1, 711 (734) g/day; p = 0.001) and in
each subgroup (groups 2–6; table 2). The decrease was
similar in those with end jejunostomy (group 2, 682 (911) g/
day; p = 0.040) and those with colon in continuity (group 3,
822 (341) g/day; p = 0.006). Absolute wet weight absorption
was obtained by subtracting faecal wet weight from diet wet
weight. Teduglutide increased absolute wet weight absorp￾tion in 15 of 16 SBS patients compared with baseline. These
increases were significant for all groups and closely reflected
the decreases in faecal output. Absolute wet weight absorp￾tion increased as a per cent of intake in 14 of 16 SBS patients.
The increase in relative absorption was 22 (16)% (p,0.001)
in group 1 (SBS patients; once daily dosing). The magnitude
was similar for SBS patients with end jejunostomy (group 2,
20 (18)%, p = 0.007) and those with >50% colon in
continuity (group 3, 26 (16)%; p = 0.023). As expected from
the increases in intestinal wet weight absorption, teduglutide
increased urine weight in 14 of 16 SBS patients (group 1, 555
(485) g/day; p,0.001) (table 3). Similar increases were seen
in those with end jejunostomy (group 2, 680 (535) g/day;
p = 0.003) and those with >50% colon in continuity (group 3,
461 (200) g/day; p = 0.007).
Sodium and potassium
Faecal sodium decreased and sodium absorption increased,
but only relative absorption (table 2), and increased urine
excretion (table 3) reached statistical significance. Faecal
potassium decreased significantly (table 2) but this was not
reflected in significant changes in intestinal absorption or
urinary excretion.
Energy
Figure 2 illustrates faecal energy excretion and intestinal
energy absorption in individual patients in group 1 at
baseline, during treatment, and at follow up. Compared with
baseline, the 16 SBS patients had significant decreases in
energy excretion on teduglutide (group 1, 808 (1453) kJ/day

was not significant (53 (48)%; p = 0.060). Five hour urinary
D-xylose excretion did not change.
Body weight
Eleven of 16 SBS patients increased their weight while on
teduglutide but the mean increase (0.9 (2.1) kg) was not
statistically significant (p = 0.120) (table 5). The weight
increase was significant (2.2 (1.1) kg; p = 0.010) in rechal￾lenged patients who also had the best absolute and relative
energy absorption.
Biopsies
Significant histological changes in relation to teduglutide
treatment were seen in the jejunum in seven of eight group 2
patients who were biopsied. There was an increase in villus
height (38 (45)%; p = 0.030), crypt depth (22 (18)%;
p = 0.010), and mitotic index (115 (108)%; p = 0.010).
Small bowel biopsies were not obtained from patients with
colon in continuity (group 3). Biopsies for measurements of
colonic crypt depth were obtained in all five patients in group
3. Crypt depth increased in four of five sets of colonic biopsies
following teduglutide treatment but the mean increase of 13
(22)% did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.330) and
the increase in mitotic index was not significant (76 (112)%;
p = 0.170). Most changes in intestinal absorption and
histology related to teduglutide treatment had reversed at
follow up.
DISCUSSION
The main findings in this study were significant effects of
teduglutide on reducing intestinal wet weight excretion and
improving wet weight absorption in SBS patients. These
effects were even seen in SBS patients with colon in
continuity, most of whom had increased endogenous GLP-2
concentrations. The 16 SBS patients in group 1 had
significantly increased absolute (743 (477) g/day; p,0.001)
and relative (22 (16)%, p,0.001) wet weight absorption,
increased urine production (555 (485) g/day; p,0.001), and
decreased faecal wet weight excretion (711 (734 g/day;
p = 0.002). Effects of equal magnitude were seen in both
SBS patients with end jejunostomy and those with >50%
colon in continuity. These effects were seen in steady state
SBS patients who were optimally treated with conventional
antisecretory and antidiarrhoeal medication.
The effects of teduglutide on wet weight absorption were
almost twofold those in the pilot study of native GLP-2 for
35 days (420 (480) g/day; p = 0.040), conducted in patients
with similar baseline wet weight absorption.12 This greater
effect could be related to differences in dose and half life of
GLP-2 and teduglutide, respectively. In the pilot study with
native GLP-2, 400 mg was given twice daily (corresponding to
0.013 (0.002) mg/kg/day; range 0.011–0.017). The teduglu￾tide doses in the current study were 3–10 times higher,
ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 mg/kg/day. Replacement of alanine
by glycine in position 2 of GLP-2 blocks degradation by
DPP-IV, extending the half life from approximately
seven minutes (GLP-2) to 0.9–2.3 hours (teduglutide).13
With only two, five, and three end jejunostomy patients
receiving 0.03, 0.10, and 0.15 mg/kg/day of teduglutide,
respectively, this study was not able to detect differences
between dosing groups. The study was closed before all
planned patients had been enrolled due to slow enrolment.
Food control for wet weight intake was poor in one patient
who received 0.03 mg/kg/day teduglutide, leaving only one
patient for evaluation (table 1). Effects on wet weight
absorption were of similar magnitude in the 0.10 and
0.15 mg/kg/day teduglutide dosing groups (958 (450) g/day
and 987 (479) g/day, respectively), suggesting a plateau was
reached at 0.10 mg/kg/day teduglutide or lower. Whether a
longer duration of teduglutide treatment would lead to a
greater effect remains to be established. Divided doses did not
seem to have a substantially greater effect but the limited
number of patients in this study does not permit firm
conclusions.
Although effects on intestinal sodium excretion and
absorption did not reach statistical significance, similar to
the study with native GLP-2, there was a significant increase
in urinary sodium excretion of 53 (40) mmol/day (p,0.001)
following teduglutide treatment and this is best explained by
decreases in faecal sodium excretion and increases in
intestinal sodium absorption, since the supply of parenteral
sodium was kept constant.
In this study, the effects of teduglutide on energy and
macronutrient absorption were minor compared with effects
on wet weight absorption. Although a decrease in faecal
energy excretion (808 (1453) kJ/day (193 (347) kcal/day);
p = 0.04) was demonstrated in group 1 SBS patients, this did
not translate into significant increases in absolute or relative
energy absorption. The inability to show a significant effect
may be due to variability in dietary energy intake during the
study periods. Group 4 patients with high dietary compliance
and low variability of dietary intake during study periods
did have a small but significant decrease in faecal energy
excretion (1060 (1083) kJ/day (253 (259 kcal/day); p = 0.01)
(table 4). This translated into a significant increase in
absolute (963 (1290) kJ/day (230 (308 kcal/day); p = 0.04)
and relative (10 (7)%; p = 0.03) intestinal energy absorption.
It was not possible to demonstrate an effect on intestinal fat
or nitrogen absorption.
The effect of teduglutide on absolute energy absorption
was twofold higher than with native GLP-2 (441 (634) kJ/
day (105 (151 kcal/day)); p = 0.09) at the given doses and
treatment periods.12 Thus in contrast with H2 receptor
antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, and octreotide, native
GLP-2 and teduglutide seem to affect both intestinal wet
weight and energy absorption, with an additional positive
effect on wet weight absorption in patients already treated
with these agents.20
Several physiological mechanisms may account for the
positive effects seen on intestinal absorption with teduglutide
treatment. SBS patients with end jejunostomy, who have
limited or no endogenous meal stimulated GLP-2 secretion,11
often suffer from gastric hypersecretion and rapid gastric
emptying, at least initially after enterectomy. GLP-2 has been
shown to diminish gastric acid secretion in sham fed healthy
humans7 and prolong gastric emptying in SBS patients.12
Therefore, it is likely that a pharmacological replacement may
restore the physiological feedback, previously described as
the ileal brake mechanism. This is the first human study
demonstrating the intestinotrophic properties of a GLP-2
analogue, which need to be verified in a controlled study. No
other pharmacological agents have been able to promote a
significant adaptation of this magnitude, possibly as a result
of increasing the absorptive surface area of the intestine. In
SBS patients with end jejunostomy, teduglutide significantly
increased small bowel villus heights (38 (45)%; p = 0.030),
crypt depth (22 (18)%; p = 0.010), and mitotic index (115
(108); p = 0.010).
The mechanisms regarding the effect of teduglutide in SBS
patients with colon in continuity are more speculative. These
patients have continuously high endogenous GLP-2 secre￾tion,21 with normal gastric secretion and emptying. However,
supraphysiological doses of teduglutide may produce local
high concentrations that suppress gastric secretion and
induce small bowel growth. Small bowel biopsies were not
obtained in these patients. In SBS patients with and without
colon in continuity, upregulation of transport proteins is
possible, as described in animal studies.22–24

Regardless of the exact physiological mechanism, increases
in intestinal absorption in relation to treatments that improve
intestinal adaptation would preferably be converted into
positive effects regarding body weight or composition,
hydration, physical activity, and ultimately quality of life.
The latter two points were not examined in either study
quoted here. Body weight did not significantly increase
following teduglutide treatment (0.9 (2.1) kg; p = 0.120).
The type and severity of adverse events will be an
important issue when considering long term treatment in
SBS patients. In this population, serious AEs were related to
the underlying condition and AEs (enlargement of stoma
nipple and mild lower leg oedema) were related to the
pharmacodynamic effects of teduglutide. The increase in
intestinal wet weight absorption may contribute to peripheral
oedema, which can be treated by reducing parenteral volume.
The pharmacodynamics of teduglutide appear to be gut
specific and AEs are limited. Therefore, teduglutide may have
a role in the long term treatment of SBS patients. The 0.75 l
of improved wet weight absorption has significant clinical
implications for this SBS patient population (for example,
less PN or fewer infusion days/weeks). Spending less time on
parenteral infusions may be valuable for the quality of life in
these patients. Non-PN dependent SBS patients may also be
candidates for this treatment. Many of these patients suffer
from repeated episodes of dehydration, renal insufficiency,
and kidney stones. Increasing wet weight absorption in these
patients may diminish those complications of SBS.
Future controlled studies with a more robust design are
needed to determine the optimal dosage and administration
of teduglutide to SBS patients to achieve the maximal effect.
Subsequent studies will determine whether optimal dosage
and administration of teduglutide will result in long term
improvements in fluid balance, nutritional status, and
independence from parenteral support in some SBS patients,
thereby improving their overall quality of life. As a result of
the positive findings of this study, a multicentre, multi￾national, controlled evaluation is now in progress.
