Mucositis is a pathological process
characterized by mucosal damage,
ranging from mild inflammation to
deep ulcerations and affecting one or more
parts of the alimentary tract, from the mouth
to the anus, as a consequence of radiation
therapy and/or chemotherapy.
1 Indeed, for
unknown reasons, other mucosae, apart
from those lining the mouth and the intes￾tine, generally escape toxicity, with the
exception of bladder mucosa after alkylating
agents and the conjunctiva after high doses
of cytarabine.
Although the mechanisms by which any
mucosal injury occurs are likely to be similar,
the unique properties of each part of the
digestive tract may modify its response to a
toxic challenge. The mucosal compartments
of the alimentary tract share the same
embryogenetic origin, but show different
functional and anatomic features, so that two
main syndromes may be distinguished: oral
mucositis (OM) and gastrointestinal mucosi￾tis (GIM).
2 Treatment-induced mucositis is
one of the most debilitating and troublesome
side effects from the patient’s perspective
and profoundly influences quality of life
(QoL), being associated with a symptom bur￾den including pain,
3 bleeding, dysphagia,
infections5 and food intake impairment,
which can result in the need for total par￾enteral nutrition (TPN).
4 In addition, mucosi￾tis is associated with longer periods of hospi￾talization, significant health and financial
costs and may interfere with the regular
administration and dosing of programmed
treatment plans and with a patient’s manage￾ment.
6,7
The most important complications associ￾ated with mucositis in oncohematologic
patients receiving myelosuppressive chemo￾therapy are infections; indeed, in neutropenic
patients mucositis is strongly associated with
bacteremia and sepsis due to Gram-negative
bacilli such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, yeasts of the Candida species, and
Gram-positive cocci, such as Streptococcus viri￾dans, as probably happens in patients with
ABSTRACT
Decision Making and Problem Solving
Mucosal barrier injury (mucositis) is a common complication of many treat- ments used in hematologic malignancies, affecting most patients whose
neoplasms are treated with intensive chemotherapy, and virtually all those
receiving myeloablative conditioning regimens prior to hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation. Mucositis has been identified as a critical risk factor for
infections and is a major driver of analgesic and total parenteral nutrition
use. Patients with this complication require careful analgesic therapy, addi- tional nursing care and longer hospitalization. To date, the measures to pre- vent and treat this potentially devastating complication are inadequate and
limited to the control of pain, infections, bleeding and nutrition. Nevertheless, in the last decade, a better insight into the pathogenesis of the mucosal dam- age has led to the development of novel therapeutic options which potential- ly could allow a targeted approach to mucositis.
Key words: mucositis, pain, hematologic malignancies, graft-versus-host
disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Mucositis in hematologic malignancies
cytarabine-induced mucositis.
8
In the setting of allogeneic stem cell transplantation
(SCT), mucositis plays a contributing role in the develop￾ment and maintenance of acute graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) through the overproduction of inflammatory
cytokines.
9 Moreover, the digestive tract, mainly the small
intestine, represents a major target of GVHD, whose
manifestations are induced by immune-mediated mecha￾nisms and appear quite similar to those related to cyto￾toxic treatments, so that GVHD-related mucosal lesions
could be considered as a mucositis with a different patho￾genesis.
10
Several forms of oral mucosal damage, such as those
related to herpes simplex virus (HSV) and candida infec￾tions, can also appear as mucositis.
11
Finally, other forms of mucosal injury are commonly
observed among patients with advanced hematologic
malignancies, such as xerostomia and alterations of taste
sensation. These injuries reflect the patient’s poor per￾formance status and the failure of local regulatory and
defense mechanisms.
12
Anatomy and physiology of the mucosal compartments
of the digestive tract
The surface of the mouth can be divided into a masticat￾ing part (lined by squamous, stratified and keratinized
epithelium), comprising the gums and hard palate, a taste￾specialized part, and a non-keratinized part comprising the
soft palate, lips, lower tongue and cheek.
13 Non-keratinized
epithelium appears stratified, with stem cells in the inner
portion, and lies on a thin lamina propria; salivary glands
located in the submucosa provide growth and antimicro￾bial factors and clearing substances. The lamina propria
contains cells belonging to the reticulo-endothelial system,
which, together with other lymphoid structures localized
in the gastrointestinal tract, form the gastrointestinal-asso￾ciated lymphoid tissue system. The esophageal mucosa
consists of stratified squamous epithelium, while a simple
cylindrical layer of cells lines the stomach.
The intestinal mucosa is more complex and consists of a
single layer of columnar epithelium. The small intestine is
characterized by simple cylindrical epithelial cells (entero￾cytes) and by mucus-producing cells organized in the struc￾ture of the villus; at the bottom of each villus there is a glan￾dular crypt; the intestinal stem cell is probably located at
the base of the crypt and could give rise to every kind of
epithelial cell. The colon and rectum have the same type of
epithelium, while the anus appears to be lined by stratified
epithelium.
Several cytokines, calcium ions, retinoic acid and vitamin
D3 are important stimulatory signals; moreover some pep￾tides, such as TGFα, EGF and trefoil peptide, act as growth
and protective factors.
14 Normally, mouth and bowel cells
undergo renewal over 7-14 and 4 days, respectively; the
differences in cellular turnover may explain why mucositis
develops in the intestine earlier than in the mouth follow￾ing radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
The mouth contains nociceptors with a high threshold
and frequency connected to fast A-δ fibers to transmit
highly discriminated stimuli; moreover C-type unmyelinat￾ed nociceptors transmit a continuous sensation of unspeci￾fied pain.
15 Mucosal homeostasis relies on a balance
between the differentiation and apoptosis of cells in the
upper layers and the mitotic activity of lower layers togeth￾er with integrin expression, and modulation of adherence.
Epidemiology and causative factors
Mucositis is the result of a pathological process to which
treatment-induced and patient-related factors con￾tribute.
2,7,16The toxicity of each drug depends on its dosage
and the time to which a patient is exposed to it, besides its
intrinsic properties. Most anticancer drugs reach the
mucous membrane through the blood, but some, such as
methotrexate and etoposide, can be found in the salivary
fluid, thus having a direct effect on epithelium.
Comorbidities, infections, poor oral hygiene and pro￾longed treatment with steroids are some patient-related
factors. Furthermore, differences in drug metabolism,
absorption, distribution, and excretion, due to the genetic
variants of several families of enzymes, seem to have pro￾nounced effects.
17
Therefore, significant differences in the severity of
mucositis among patients treated with the same
chemotherapy regimens may be due to several factors,
such as the genetic variations in a patient’s pharmacody￾namic responses to chemotherapeutic agents. For example,
the administration of methotrexate, a highly mucotoxic
agent, was associated with different rates of mucositis in
patients undergoing allogeneic SCT according to patient’s
genotype of a polymorphism in the 5,10-methylenete￾trahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (C677T); patients
with the MTHFR TT genotype have lower MTHFR activi￾ty and were noted to have more severe mucositis than
patients with wild-type enzymes.
18 Moreover, genetic
polymorphisms for thiopurine S-methyltransferase are a
major factor responsible for large individual variations in
both the toxicity and therapeutic effect of thiopurine.
19
Thus far, there is no predictive model of the risk of
mucositis, at the beginning of therapy. However, by
exploiting molecular diagnostic methods, pharmacoge￾nomics will eventually allow routine determination of a
patient’s genotype, enabling the physician to tailor the drug
and dosage to the individual patient.
Mucositis following chemotherapy
Some groups of anticancer drugs, alone or in combina￾tion, are particularly often responsible for mucositis. The
most recorded mucotoxic agents are: thymidine syn￾thetase inhibitors, such as methotrexate, topoisomerase
II inhibitors (etoposide, irinotecan); pyrmidine analogs
(cytarabine); purine analogs (6-mercaptopurine and 6-
thioguanine); alkylating agents at high doses (busulfan,

| 224 | haematologica/the hematology journal | 2007; 92(02)
P. Niscola et al.
melphalan and cyclophosphamide); and intercalating
drugs (idarubicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin). When
these agents are administered in multiple cycles, the risk
of mucositis increases at each course.
7 Following a stan￾dard dose-dense chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin’s lym￾phomas (NHL), such as the CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) regimen, the
reported incidence of OM is between 2% and 10%; the
addition of rituximab and a shorter interval of administra￾tion (CHOP-14 regimen) has not been associated with a
higher incidence of OM.
20
In a group of elderly NHL patients, the incidence of
OM was reported to be reduced by replacing doxoru￾bicin with epirubicin or mitoxantrone.
21 Among third
generation protocols for NHL, OM occurred in 11% of
patients who had received MACOP-B therapy (interme￾diate dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophos￾phamide, vincristine, prednisone and bleomycin) and in
less than 3% of those treated with F-MACHOP (fluo￾rouracil, intermediate dose methotrexate, doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and cytara￾bine).
22 In the setting of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the
reported incidence of mucositis was 3% in patients who
received the ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomicine, vinblas￾tine and dacarbazine) regimen versus 8% in those treat￾ed with hybrid multidrug regimens.
23
Finally, the mucosal toxicity associated with almost
intensified combination regimens given as salvage treat￾ment for lymphoma patients is generally mild and man￾ageable. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
treated with standard anthracycline-based regimens
develop profound myelosuppression and OM (10-15%
of cases).
24 In this setting, liposomal daunorubicin seems
to reduce the incidence of mucositis,
25 while more
aggressive protocols cause a higher incidence: the FLAG
(fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF) protocol induces
mucosal damage in 50% of patients,
26 a rate that rises to
70% in those treated with idarubicin-containing
FLAG.
27 In patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia
treated with trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which can
cause mucosal dryness, and idarubicin, the incidence of
OM is about 10%, as observed in patients treated with
an ATRA and idarubicin-containing (AIDA) protocol.
28,29
Hydroxyurea is used as a pre-induction, palliative or
mild myelosuppressive drug in AML and has not been
associated with mucosal injury. In contrast, among the
oral agents available for the treatment of the disease, 6-
mercaptopurine is strongly mucotoxic. Finally, some
agents currently used in oncohematology, such as inter￾feron and imatinib, do not produce mucosal damage.
The frequent watery diarrhea following bortezomib
administration is probably due to intestinal neuropathy
rather than to mucositis.
Mucositis due to monoclonal antibodies
Gentuzumab-ozogamicin, a monoclonal antibody
targeting the CD33 antigen on blast membranes, has no
effect on the mucosa, but its use can result in prolonged
myelosuppression, so that OM occurs in about 4% of
people treated with this agent.
30 Rituximab and alem￾tuzumab, which are increasingly used in the setting of
lymphoproliferative syndromes, do not have a muco￾toxic effect. Recent advances have led to the use of
radioimmunotherapy in patients with advanced NHL;
Yttrium 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan has lower mucosal
toxicity than standard chemotherapy.
31
Mucositis during transplantation
The factors associated with the development of
mucositis during autologous SCT are the amount of
chemotherapy administered, the previous exposure to
some drugs (e.g. anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids,
cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, platinum analogs and
methotrexate), female gender and the type of disease.
7
Furthermore, radiotherapy, a diagnosis of NHL and
etoposide administration as part of the stem cell mobiliz￾ing regimen have been associated with worse mucosi￾tis.
32,33 Patients affected by hematologic malignancies have
a higher risk of developing mucositis than those affected
by solid tumors who are submitted to the same proce￾dure.
34 Conditioning regimens, above all those containing
busulfan and melphalan or based on radiotherapy, play a
crucial role in the development of mucositis.
The BEAM schedule (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and
melphalan) is currently used as a conditioning regimen for
patients affected by lymphoma and is responsible for
severe mucositis in 75% of cases.
35 The association of
idarubicin with busulfan for autologous SCT in AML
patients caused profound mucosal derangement in 82%
of patients.
36 High doses of melphalan (200 mg/m2
), given
prior to autologous SCT for multiple myeloma, caused
mucosal injury in about 35% of them;
37 intermediate
doses (100 mg/m2
) significantly reduced the incidence of
mucositis to 23%, as reported in a study including
patients over 70 years old.
38 In the allogeneic SCT setting,
the incidence of mucositis reaches 75 to 100%, depending
on the type of disease and procedure and on the condi￾tioning regimen;
7 moreover, true ulcerations in the mouth
have been reported in 76% of cases.
39 Risk factors for
mucosal damage in allogeneic SCT are a pre-transplant
body mass index higher than 25 as well as the use of total
body irradiation (TBI) as part of the conditioning regi￾men.
40 Moreover MTX as prophylaxis for GVHD has
been associated with a significantly higher incidence of
mucositis than other immunosuppressive drugs.
41
Reduced myeloablative regimens for allogeneic SCT
result in a low incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity.
42
GVHD can affect the whole gastrointestinal tract, the
mouth being involved in 80% of the cases.

Biological phase Description and comments
Phase 1: Initiation RT or CT causes damage to the DNA in basal epithelial
cells and generates ROS, which further damage cells
and blood vessels in the submucosa.
Phase 2: Signaling RT or CT and ROS induce apoptosis and upregulate
inflammatory cytokines in cells.
Phase 3:Amplification Inflammatory cytokines produce further tissue damage,
amplifying signaling cascades and the injury process.
Phase 4: Ulceration Loss of mucosal integrity produces extremely painful
lesions, providing portals of entry for bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
Phase 5: Healing Proliferation, differentiation,and migration of epithelial
cells to restore the integrity of the mucosa.The
presence of mucositis is associated with a decreased
absolute neutrophil count (ANC),given that neutrophils
and mucosal basal cells are actively reproducing
cells that tend to be damaged by chemotherapeutic
agents.They recover in parallel. Although healing of mucosal tissue is not dependent
on the return of theANC, the lesions tend to resolve when theANC returns to normal, indicating
normal mitotic activity of basal cells.

Mucositis in hematologic malignancies
addressed and almost exclusively in nursing literature.
The incidence of oral mucositis-related pain syndromes is
40-70% among patients treated with chemotherapy,
100% in those in whom radiotherapy is delivered to treat
head and neck tumors, and 60-85% in the setting of allo￾geneic SCT45,46 with significant pain lasting from the 4th to
the 11th day after transplantation.
39
Pathogenesis
Typically, oral symptoms develop 5 to 8 days after the
administration of chemotherapy and last approximately 7
to 14 days. OM was previously thought to be a four￾phase biological process involving an inflammatory/vas￾cular phase, an epithelial phase, an ulcerative/bacterial
phase and a healing phase. The pathobiology of mucosi￾tis, including the gastrointestinal forms, is currently
defined as a five-phase process: initiation, signaling with
generation of messengers, amplification, ulceration, and,
finally, healing (Table 1). Although this model is described
in a linear way, injury occurs quickly and simultaneously
in all mucosal tissues.
2 At the beginning DNA damage,
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the
coincident activation of other pathways occur. During the
upregulation and message generation phase, transcription
factors, such as nuclear factor κ-B (NFκ-B)
47 are activated
to upregulate genes in the endothelium, fibroblasts,
macrophages, and epithelium; this process is followed by
the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and enzymes, which mediate a series
of biological events leading to apoptosis and amplification
of the injury, loss of epithelial integrity and the develop￾ment of ulceration.
2 At this stage, bacteria colonize the
ulcer’s surface and increase the injury by shedding of cell￾wall products and, in the presence of granulocytopenia,
may cause bacteremia and sepsis. Ultimately, sponta￾neous healing occurs.
The lesions in the mouth mainly involve the non-kera￾tinised part that becomes susceptible to overinfection,
while the cytopathic effect is more severe in the ileum. In
a longitudinal study including patients who underwent
myelosuppression and allogeneic SCT, oral ulcers were
present in 76%, mostly affecting the non-keratinised
mucosa, an average of 5 days after the infusion of the
stem cells. The ulcers persisted for an average of 6 days
and 90% of them had improved by day 15,
39 when the
granulocyte count exceeded 500/mm3
.
GIM develops through multiple mechanisms including
induction of crypt cell death (apoptosis) and cytostasis.
Although the molecular control of these events through￾out the gastrointestinal tract has yet to be fully elucidat￾ed, p53, of the Bcl-2 family, and caspases have been
reported to be involved.
48 An increase of apoptosis can be
observed by 24 hours after the administration of antipro￾liferative therapy, which is followed by a reduction in the
length of the intestinal villi causing mucosal flattening
around the 3rd day. From the 5th day, hyperplasia of the
intestinal mucosa leads to the ad integrum recovery of the

gastrointestinal barrier.49 Although it is possible to assess
gut mucosal damage by both sugar permeability tests and
serum citrulline, these functional tests remain abnormal
despite clinical resolution and full anatomic and function￾al recovery of the affected portions of the intestine.50 The
reason for this is not known.
Clinical features
The main symptom of OM is dysphagia, which may
be mild or severe, together with nausea, sialorrhea,
sometimes profuse, and infections. The pain syndromes
can range from a sense of burning in the initial phases
up to severe forms and are caused by a mixture of dif￾ferent types of pain. The main components are nocicep￾tive pain, mediated by C fibers and relievable by opi￾oids, and incidental pain, caused by movement and con￾tact with the mucosal surface, mediated by the fast-con￾ducting A-δ fibers. The latter component is insensitive
to analgesics and the only effective pain treatment is the
functional exclusion of the anatomic parts involved until
the resolution of the ulcers and full recovery of the
mouth’s functionality. The symptoms of GIM are vis￾ceral pain (ranging from mild pain to projected abdomi￾nal wall pain), hypermotility with diarrhea, starting
from the 3rd day after the beginning of the treatment and
resolving by the 7th day, coinciding with the full clinical
flare of the OM. In patients undergoing treatment
including high doses of cytarabine, the diarrhea general￾ly develops between the 5th and 8th day after starting
chemotherapy and persists over the second week. This
clinical picture is usually transitory after chemotherapy,
while in some patients treated with radiotherapy the
mucosal damage may evolve towards a chronic phase
characterized by impaired absorption and altered intes￾tinal motility. In addition, GIM can be complicated by
gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation, and infection.51
Mucositis due to GVHD
The clinical manifestations of acute GVHD may be
superimposed on those of cytotoxic GIM (Table 2). In a
prospective study based on endoscopic evaluation and
biopsy of the bowel of patients undergoing allogeneic
SCT, the most frequent finding among symptomatic
patients complaining of diarrhea was GIM52,53 while only
a minority of the patients were affected by GVHD.
The pathogenesis of acute GVHD is somewhat com￾plex. Endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and intestinal
flora all play important roles. LPS stimulate the produc￾tion of TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-12, which are the mediators of
GVHD. Moreover, inflammation and/or LPS may activate
alloreactive donor T lymphocytes.54,55 On the other hand,
high dose chemotherapy and TBI, by causing the release
of large quantities of inflammatory cytokines from the
damaged agstrointestinal tract, contribute to the worsen-

ing of GVHD.
54,56 Chronic GVHD rarely appears before
day 80 after allogeneic SCT and oral involvement can be
revealed by the following clinical findings: angular cheili￾tis, xerostomia, atrophy of the papillae, lichen planus and
painful ulcers on the sides of the tongue. In addition,
involvement of the salivary glands, with consequences
ranging from transient xerostomia to complete destruc￾tion of the glandular structures, has also been reported.
55
Lastly, the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by
chronic GVHD is characterized by abnormal motility and
bowel strictures and stenosis, sometimes requiring surgi￾cal treatment.
Diagnostic criteria and clinical evaluation
The assessment and clinical evaluation of mucositis still
pose challenges in clinical practice due to the lack of stan￾dard diagnostic criteria established by controlled studies.
7
Briefly, the World Health Organization (WHO) Oral
Toxicity Scale measures anatomical, symptomatic, and
functional components of OM. The severity of the condi￾tion is graded by a scale from 0 (no oral mucositis) to 4
(patient requiring TPN). By contrast, the Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), Acute Radiation
Morbidity Scoring Criteria for mucous membranes, and
the revised OM staging system of the Western Consor￾tium for Cancer Nursing Research (WCCNR), assess only
the anatomical changes associated with OM. The
WCCNR scale is a 4-grade assessment tool (Table 3).
7,58
The Oral Mucositis Index (OMI) considers the severity
of OM in terms of erythema, ulceration, atrophy and
edema (Table 4), each graded on a scale from 0 to 3
(0=none, 3=severe). The OMI has been shown to be inter￾nally consistent with high test-retest and inter-rater relia￾bility and exhibits strong evidence of construct validity.
59
The Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS) has been
proven to be highly reproducible between observers and
accurate in recording elements associated with OM. The
OMAS (Table 5) provides an objective assessment of OM
and is also a significant predictor of important outcomes
in transplanted patients. The score estimates the presence
and size of ulcerations or pseudomembranes (score 0 to 3;
0=no lesion; 1=lesion <1cm2
; 2= lesion of 1cm2 to 3cm2
;
3= lesion > 3cm2
) and erythema (score 0 to 2; 0=none;
1=not severe; 2=severe) on the upper and lower lips, right
and left cheeks, right and left ventral and lateral tongue,
floor of the mouth, soft palate/fauces and hard palate.
6,7
The evaluation of GIM relies on the presence and the
frequency of signs and/or symptoms, diarrhea (volume
and frequency of the evacuations) and the onset of com￾plications. The principal instruments used to assess GIM
have been described by Sonis et al.
7 Table 6 presents the
NCI/CTC criteria for grading mucositis-associated diar￾rhea. A critical aspect in the management of these
patients, particularly those with OM, is the regular assess￾ment of the pain.
60 Various assessment tools are described
elsewhere.
3,61
Prevention of mucositis
Despite its clinical significance, there is still no standard
approach to the prevention or treatment of mucositis.
Interventions have been limited to the use of palliative
measures, barrier protectants, topical antimicrobials, ice,
and analgesics, although none of these measures has
proven to be consistently effective.
62 Basic oral hygiene,
periodic control of dental health and comprehensive
patient education are important components of the care of
any patient with hematologic malignancies at risk of
OM.
63
Effective approaches for the prevention and manage￾ment of OM include oral cryotherapy and low-level laser
therapy for patients undergoing SCT.
64 Cryotherapy seems
to be effective in limited areas of the oral mucosa, as well
as a treatment for melphalan-induced mucositis.
65 Anti￾biotic prophylaxis, although considered a reasonable
measure in subjects undergoing myelosuppression, is inef￾fective in reducing the colonizing microbes present on the
mucosal surface during autologous SCT.
66 The topical
application of chlorhexidine,
67 GM-CSF,
67 the salivary pro￾duction stimulator pilocarpine,
68 and histamine gel
69 is not
recommended for the prophylaxis of OM given the report￾ed lack of efficacyof these agents. Moreover, no benefits
have been found from the use of the amino acid glutamine
in the setting of SCT.

The value of OMAS at any given assessment is obtained by summing the
erythema and ulceration/pseudomembrane subscores at each site (possible score
range, 0 to 5), and then averaging these scores across all sites (i.e. the maxillary
labial mucosa, the mandibular labial mucosa, the right buccal mucosa, the left buc￾cal mucosa, the right lateral and ventral tongue, the left lateral and ventral tongue, the floor of the mouth and lingual frenum, and the soft palate and fauces).

prostaglandin synthesis, and by inhibiting leukocyte￾endothelial interactions, has been shown to exert analgesic
effects in patients at risk of OM;
71 the antibiotic clar￾ithromycin,
72 which stimulates macrophage functions, has
also shown a partial effectiveness. Amifostine, a cytopro￾tectant free radical scavenger, has been successfully
employed in the prevention of mucositis following SCT,
73
while the potential role of non-steroidal anti-inflammato￾ry drugs, although promising, has not yet been estab￾lished.
74 Therefore, to date, none of the above described
agents has been recognized or recommended as the gold
standard for the prophylaxis and/or the treatment of
mucositis. A consensus has recently been reached on the
use of sulfalazine to prevent gastrointestinal mucositis in
patients undergoing radiotherapy, while octreotide is con￾sidered useful for reducing the frequency and volume of
diarrhea.
62
Treatment of mucositis
In recent years, considerable research has been con￾ducted on the pathobiology of mucositis in search for
novel therapeutic agents.
75 Among the latest discoveries,
the most promising is palifermin, a human recombinant
keratinocyte growth factor (KGF).
76 Upon activation of
the transcription factor Nrf2, which encodes for other
genes playing a role in detoxifying ROS, palifermin exerts
its effects on keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial
cells. Moreover, KGF has the ability to attenuate the
effects of TNF-α and the expression of adhesion mole￾cules. In a clinical trial this drug, compared to a placebo,
significantly reduced the incidence and duration of severe
OM (WHO grade 3-4) after myeloablative therapy in can￾cer patients.
76
Therefore, palifermin and two human fibroblast
growth factors (repifermin, velafermin)
77 could pave the
road to a targeted approach to the prevention of mucosi￾tis.
78,79 Some compounds under evaluation for the treat￾ment or prevention of mucositis are listed in Table 7.
Approach to GVHD-related mucositis
The current therapeutic approach to GVHD-induced
mucositis exploits agents thought to be capable of inter￾fering with the pathogenesis of the disease. KGF may be
useful for lowering levels of LPS and TNF-α,
80 while
cyclosporine, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD40 lig￾and antibodies and sirolimus (rapamycin) block donor T￾cell activation and differentiation.
81 Furthermore,
daclizumab (IL-2 receptor antagonist) or infliximab (anti￾TNF-α antibody), coupled with antifungal therapy, are

Variables Setting and regulation
Loading dose The effective starting dose allowing complete relief or,
at least, significant alleviation of pain (i.e. IV morphine
1 mg/5 minutes until pain relief).
Incremental dose The dose deliverable by the device system in response to
the patient’s demand (IV morphine 0.5 – 1.0 mg).
Duration Time to deliver the incremental dose (usually,at least 5
minutes for IV morphine).
Lock-out time The controlled time between two consecutive incremental
doses (IV morphine 5–15 minutes).
Background Basal opioid infusion. Usually not required.

Concentration Constant and carefully monitoring of the concentration of
analgesic solutions is needed.
Hourly or fourthly Pre-established amount of opioid that the patient may
limits periodically require. Caution and safety limits adopted to
avoid opioid over dosage.
IV: intravenous.

effective against cytotoxicity towards the host target.
82
The topical treatment of oral ulcers due to acute GVHD
includes steroids83 and tacrolimus.
84 In contrast, steroids
are not first-line treatment for chronic GVHD, since new
immunomodulators such as mycophenolate, monoclonal
antibodies (daclizumab, alemtuzumab, and rituximab),
sirolimus and pentostatin are more effective and lack the
long-term side-effects of steroids.
85
Supportive therapy and pain control
Supportive therapy and control of symptoms are critical
aspects of the management of patients with mucositis,
who generally receive TPN and analgesics. Recently, the
role of TPN required for less than 10 days for OM in pedi￾atric patients has been discussed. In a prospective random￾ized study, 30 children with WHO grade 4 OM were
assigned to receive either TPN or intravenous fluid thera￾py. No differences in recovery of peripheral white blood
cells, incidence of infections, hospitalization time, days on
intravenous antibiotics, days on opioid analgesics or delay
of the next scheduled chemotherapy course were
observed between the two groups.
86
Analgesic therapy is an essential measure that, besides
relieving pain, can allow the resumption of oral alimenta￾tion and reduce the time spent in hospital.
87 However, the
only measure to control the incidental pain related to mas￾tication and swallowing is to exclude oral feeding and
institute TPN or intravenous fluid therapy. Topical anal￾gesics and anesthetics have been proposed to be of poten￾tial use in controlling the nociceptive pain component.
88
Nevertheless, the mainstay of analgesic therapy in
patients with OM is parenteral administration of opioids:
tramadol can be employed for the control of mild to mod￾erate pain,
61 while intravenous morphine is the recom￾mended fisrt-line therapy to relieve more severe pain. This
can be administered using a system of patient-controlled
analgesia (PCA), which is associated with lower doses and
a shorter duration of opioid therapy, when compared with
a continuous infusion system,
89 although requiring careful
monitoring by skilled nurses. Table 8 shows the main
parameters to be considered for the use of PCA. Little
experience exists on the use of transdermal buprenorphine
in the setting of SCT, while conflicting results have been
reported on the efficacy of transdermal fentanyl as a pain
reliever in patients undergoing autologous SCT.
90-92
Conclusions
Our understanding of the biological basis of mucosal
barrier injury induced by antitumor therapies continues to
evolve, opening the promising perspective of a possible
pathogenetic-based approach to the prophylaxis and
treatment of mucositis. The mucosal response to cytotox￾ic insults appears to be controlled by both global factors
(gender, underlying systemic disease and race) and tissue￾specific factors (epithelial type, local microbial environ￾ment and function). Interactions between these elements,
coupled with underlying genetic influences, most likely
govern the risk, course and severity of regimen-related
mucosal injury.
93 Further progress in the field of pharma￾cogenomics may allow treatment to be tailored according
to the enzymatic profile of the individual patient to attain
a more favorable balance between the clinical benefit and
side effects of cytostatic chemotherapy whilst obviating
the need for dose reductions.
