Introduction
Exposure to chronic hypoxia leads to the develop￾ment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) owing to per￾sistent vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of
pulmonary vessels. Proliferation of vascular smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) is an important component of
pulmonary vessel remodeling that results in increased
thickness of the medial muscular coat in normally
muscular arteries and in extension of muscle into
smaller and more peripheral arteries (1). The mecha￾nism by which hypoxia induces pulmonary SMCs’
proliferation, however, is not well understood. One
current hypothesis is that hypoxia may directly affect
the expression of specific genes involved in pul￾monary vascular SMC growth (2).
The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) trans￾porter (5-HTT) in pulmonary vascular SMCs has many
attributes suggesting that it may be a key determinant
of pulmonary vessel remodeling. In addition to con￾tributing to the uptake and subsequent inactivation of
5-HT passing through the lung, 5-HTT mediates the
proliferation of pulmonary vascular SMCs through its
ability to internalize indoleamine (3, 4). The require￾ment of 5-HTT as a mediator of 5-HT mitogenic activ￾ity appears specific for pulmonary vascular SMCs, since
it has not been reported in other cell types (5). More￾over, exposure of pulmonary vascular SMCs to hypox￾ia increases 5-HTT expression and activity (3, 6), an
effect associated with potentiation of the mitogenic
action of 5-HT (6). Increased 5-HTT gene expression
also occurs in remodeled pulmonary vessels of rats dur￾ing PH development associated with chronic exposure
to hypoxia (6). Because 5-HTT is a target for drugs that
recently have been shown to increase the risk of PH
development in humans (7), it may be of clinical rele￾vance; therefore elucidation of its role in pulmonary
vascular SMC proliferation is of interest. However,
direct evidence for a role of 5-HTT in vessel remodeling
during PH is lacking.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
5-HTT deficiency affects the development of pul￾monary vascular remodeling and PH during chronic
hypoxia. We used mice with targeted disruption of the
5-HTT gene (5-HTT–/–) (8) and investigated their hemo￾The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2000 | Volume 105 | Number 11 1555

Hypoxia is a well-recognized stimulus for pulmonary blood vessel remodeling and pulmonary hyper￾tension development. One mechanism that may account for these effects is the direct action of hypox￾ia on the expression of specific genes involved in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation.
Previous studies demonstrated that the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) transporter (5-HTT)
mediates the mitogenic activity of 5-HT in pulmonary vascular SMCs and is overexpressed during
hypoxia. Thus, 5-HT-related mitogenic activity is increased during hypoxia. Here, we report that mice
deficient for 5-HTT (5-HTT–/–) developed less hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and vascular remod￾eling than paired 5-HTT+/+ controls. When maintained under normoxia, 5-HTT–/–-mutant mice had
normal hemodynamic parameters, low blood 5-HT levels, deficient platelet 5-HT uptake, and
unchanged blood levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a metabolite of 5-HT. After exposure to 10%
O2 for 2 or 5 weeks, the number and medial wall thickness of muscular pulmonary vessels were
reduced in hypoxic 5-HTT–/– mice as compared with wild-type paired controls. Concomitantly, right
ventricular systolic pressure was lower and right ventricle hypertrophy less marked in the mutant
mice. This occurred despite potentiation of acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in the 5-HTT–/–
mice. These data further support a key role of 5-HTT in hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular SMC
proliferation and pulmonary hypertension.

dynamics and circulating 5-HT. We then examined 5-
HTT expression, PH development, and pulmonary ves￾sel muscularization in 5-HTT–/– mice and wild-type con￾trols exposed to chronic hypoxia. To determine whether
5-HTT deficiency could be associated with changes in
the extent of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, we
also examined the pressure response to acute hypoxia in
both 5-HTT–/– and 5-HTT+/+ mice.
Methods
Mice. Mice lacking 5-HTT (5-HTT–/–) were generated by
homologous recombination on the C57B6/SV129 genet￾ic background. The wild-type 5-HTT+/+ and mutant
homozygous 5-HTT–/– mice used in these studies were sib￾lings (8–10 weeks of age) obtained by breeding heterozy￾gous mutants. Pups were typed by Southern blot analysis
of tail biopsies as described previously (8). Responses to
either acute or chronic hypoxia were then examined in
male 5-HTT+/+ and 5-HTT–/– littermates. For the study of
chronic hypoxia effects, mice were randomly divided into
two groups, one of which was maintained in room air and
the other exposed to hypoxia. All animal care and proce￾dures were in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Hemodynamic response of normoxic mice to acute hypoxia.
Mice 8–10 weeks of age, weighing approximately 20–30
g were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine 
(6 mg/100 g) and xylazine (1 mg/100 g). The trachea was
cannulated, and the lungs were ventilated with room air
at a tidal volume of 0.2 mL and a rate of 90 breaths per
minute. A 26-gauge needle was then introduced percu￾taneously into the right ventricle via the subxiphoid
approach. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was
measured using a Gould P10 EZ pressure transducer
connected to pressure modules and a Gould TA 550
recorder. Right ventricular systolic pressure and heart
rate were recorded first while the animal was ventilated
with room air and then after 5 minutes of ventilation
with the hypoxic gas mixture (8% O2, 92% N2). The heart
rate under these conditions was between 300 and 500
beats per minute (bpm). If the heart rate fell below 300
bpm, measurements were excluded from analysis.
Exposure to chronic hypoxia. Mice were exposed to
chronic hypoxia (10% O2) in a ventilated chamber 
(500-L volume; Flufrance, Cachan, France) as described
previously (9). To establish the hypoxic environment,
the chamber was flushed with a mixture of room air and
nitrogen, and the gas was recirculated. The chamber
environment was monitored using an oxygen analyzer
(Servomex OA150; Servomex, Crowborough, United
Kingdom). Carbon dioxide was removed by soda lime
granules, and excess humidity was prevented by cooling
of the recirculation circuit. The chamber temperature
was maintained at 22–24°C. The chamber was opened
every other day for 1 hour to clean the cages and replen￾ish food and water supplies. Normoxic mice were kept
in the same room, with the same light-dark cycle.
Assessment of pulmonary hypertension. Mice exposed pre￾viously to hypoxia or room air for 2 or 5 weeks were anes￾thetized and ventilated with room air as described above.
After incision of the abdomen and diaphragm, a 26-
gauge needle connected to a pressure transducer was
inserted into the right ventricle, and RVSP was recorded
immediately. Next, blood was sampled for hematocrit
determination and 5-HT measurements. Finally, after an
intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (40
mg/kg) and exsanguination, the thorax was opened and
the lungs and heart were removed. The right ventricle
(RV) was dissected from the left ventricle plus septum
(LV+S), and these dissected samples were weighed.
The lungs were fixed by intratracheal infusion of 4%
aqueous buffered formalin at a pressure of 23 cmH2O.
The entire specimen was placed in a bath of the same
fixative for 1 week. A midsagittal slice of the right
lung, including the apical, azygous, and diaphrag￾matic lobes, was processed for paraffin embedding.
Sections (5 µm thick) were cut for use in light
microscopy and stained with hematoxylin-phloxine￾saffron and orcein-picroindigo-carmine.
In each mouse, a total of 50–60 intraacinar vessels
accompanying either alveolar ducts or alveoli were
analyzed by an observer blinded to the genotype and
treatment. Each vessel was categorized as nonmuscu￾lar (no evidence of any vessel wall muscularization),
partially muscular (SMCs identifiable in less than
three-fourths of the vessel circumference), or fully
muscular (SMCs in more than three-fourths of the ves￾sel circumference). Muscularization was defined as the
presence of typical SMCs stained red with phloxine,
exhibiting an elongated shape and square-ended
nucleus, and bound by two orcein-stained elastic lam￾inae. The percentage of pulmonary vessels in each
muscularization category was determined by dividing
the number of vessels in that category by the total
number counted in the same experimental group.
For fully muscular vessels, video images were obtained
and arterial diameters were measured using computer￾ized image analysis device. Percent of wall thickness was
then calculated as the diameter of the external elastic
lamina minus the diameter of the internal lamina divid￾ed by the diameter of the external elastic lamina.
Measurement of systemic arterial pressure in normoxic mice.
To assess systemic arterial pressure in 5-HTT+/+ and 
5-HTT–/– mice, animals were anesthetized with intraperi￾toneal ketamine (6 mg/100 g) and xylazine (1 mg/100 g).
The right carotid was exposed, and a polyethylene
catheter (PE10) was inserted into the carotid artery.
Platelet [3H]5-HT uptake. The protocol used to measure
platelet [3H]5-HT uptake in normoxic mice of each geno￾type was adapted from Prina et al. (10). Briefly, blood was
collected by cardiac puncture in anesthetized mice and
centrifuged at 600 g for 10 minutes in 13 mM of citrate
to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The platelets were
counted, and assays were performed by incubating 100
µL of PRP (107 platelets) with 0.2 µM of 5-hydroxy[G- 3H]tryptamine creatinine sulfate ([3H]5-HT, 15–16
Ci/mmol) (Amersham International, Amersham, United
Kingdom). Under these conditions, [3H]5-HT uptake by
platelets was linear for at least 5 minutes. Assays were per￾1556 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2000 | Volume 105 | Number 11

formed for 1 minute at 37°C with or without the specif￾ic 5-HTT inhibitor fluoxetine (10–5 M). The reaction was
stopped by adding 2 mL of cold 0.9% NaCl containing
0.4% EDTA, and the samples were centrifuged at 3,600 g
for 10 minutes. The platelets were washed three times
using 2 mL of the same buffer, then centrifuged. The
platelet-free supernatant was discarded, and the platelet
pellet was lysed by addition of 1 mL of 0.1 N NaOH.
Lysate radioactivity was counted using liquid scintillation
spectrometry. Specific [3H]5-HT uptake calculated as the
difference between total uptake and uptake in the pres￾ence of fluoxetine was expressed in femtomoles of [3H]5-
HT taken up per milligram of protein measured using
the method of Lowry et al. (11), with BSA as the standard.
Blood 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations. The amine
and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-
HIAA) were determined in whole blood using HPLC
coupled to electrochemical detection, as described in
detail elsewhere (12).
Lung 5-HTT immunoblotting. Immediately after removal,
the lungs were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. After
thawing at 0°C, the tissues were sonicated in 0.1 mM
PBS containing antiproteases (1 µM leupeptin and 1 µM
pepstatin A). The homogenates were subjected to SDS￾PAGE. Proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocel￾lulose membrane by electroblotting in a transblot Bio￾Rad transfer apparatus for 12 hours at 4°C. Before the
transfer, the gels, Whatman filter paper, and nitrocellu￾lose membrane were soaked in electroblotting buffer (25
mM Tris-HCl; 193 mM glycine; 20% methanol, pH 8.0)
for 15 minutes. After transfer, the membrane was
blocked using 1× TBST (0.15 M NaCl; 10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0; 0.05% Tween-20; and 5% BSA) for 1 hour at room
temperature. The 5-HTT protein was detected by incu￾bating the membrane overnight at 4°C with goat poly￾clonal anti–5-HTT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, California, USA) diluted 1:1000. The membrane
was washed three times in 1× TBST. Specific protein was
detected using a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated sec￾ondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) reagents (Amersham). The 5-HTT immunoreac￾tivity was quantified using a semiautomated image
analysis device (National Institutes of Health image 1.52)
that quantifies both the area and the intensity of
immunoreactive bands using a ScanJet II scanner with
DeskScan II software (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, Cali￾fornia, USA). Results are reported in arbitrary units.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Paraffin sections (5
µm thick) were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides
(Fisher Scientific. Illkirch, France). For 5-HTT

immunostaining, the slides were dewaxed in 100%
toluene, and the sections were then rehydrated by
successive immersion first in decreasing ethanol
concentrations (100%, 95%, and 70%) then in water.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using
H2O2 in methanol (0.3% vol/vol) for 10 minutes.
After three PBS washes, sections were preincubated
in PBS supplemented with 3% (wt/vol) BSA for 30
minutes, then incubated overnight at 4°C with goat
polyclonal anti–5-HTT antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) diluted to 1:2000 in 1× PBS, 0.02%
BSA. Next, the sections were exposed for 1 hour to
biotin-labeled anti-goat secondary antibodies
(DAKO Corp., Trappes, France) diluted 1:200 in the
same buffer. Peroxidase staining of the slides incu￾bated in streptavidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase
solution was carried out using 3,3′-diaminobenzi￾dine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate (DAB; Sigma￾Aldrich Chemie S.a.r.l., St. Quentin Fallavier, France)
and hydrogen peroxide. Finally, the sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Statistical analysis. All results are reported as mean
plus or minus SEM. The nonparametric Mann-Whit￾ney test was used to compare 5-HTT+/+ and 5-HTT–/–
normoxic mice. Two-way ANOVA was used to assess,
in 5-HTT+/+ and 5-HTT–/– mice, the effects of normoxia
or hypoxia of various duration on hemodynamics,
hematocrit, the right ventricular hypertrophy index,
and muscularization. When ANOVA indicated an
interaction between exposure conditions and 5-HTT
expression, 5-HTT+/+ and 5-HTT–/– mice were further
compared under each condition using an unpaired
nonparametric test. To compare the degree of pul￾monary vessel muscularization between the two geno￾types under each condition, the nonparametric Mann￾Whitney test was performed after ordinal
classification of pulmonary vessels as nonmuscular,
partially muscular, or muscular.
Results
Platelet [3H]5-HT uptake, blood 5-HT, and 5-HIAA concen￾trations in 5-HTT–/– versus 5-HTT+/+ normoxic mice. As
expected, 5-HTT gene knockout resulted in a dramatic
reduction in [3H]5-HT uptake by platelets in the 5-HTT–/–
mutants (n = 6) as compared with wild-type animals 
(n = 6) (Figure 1). Furthermore, [3H]5-HT accumulation
in platelets from wild-type mice was almost completely
inhibited (–90%) by 10 µM fluoxetine, whereas uptake
measured in platelets from 5-HTT–/– mutants was insen￾sitive to selective 5-HTT inhibitor (Figure 1).
Whole blood 5-HT levels were also dramatically
reduced in 5-HTT–/– mice (n = 6) as compared with
wild-type mice (n = 6) (Figure 1), whereas blood 5-
HIAA levels did not differ between the two groups 
(n = 5 in each group) (Figure 1).
Hemodynamic response to acute hypoxia. The effect of an
acute hypoxic challenge on RVSP was examined in nor￾moxic mice. Whereas under ventilation with room air,
RVSP and heart rate did not differ between 5-HTT+/+ and
5-HTT–/– mice, exposure to 8% O2 elicited a larger
increase in RVSP (Figure 2) in 5-HTT–/– than in 5-HTT+/+
mice (∆RVSP, 8.5 ± 1.2 mmHg, n = 6, vs. 4.2 ± 0.5 mmHg,
n = 6, respectively; P < 0.01) despite similar heart rates.
Development of pulmonary hypertension and vascular remod￾eling. Under normoxic conditions, body weight (BW), RV
weight/BW, hematocrit, and heart rate were similar in 5-
HTT+/+ and 5-HTT–/– mice (n = 9 in each group) (Table 1).
Neither did mean systemic arterial pressure differ signif￾icantly between 5-HTT+/+ and 5-HTT–/– mice (160 ± 3.5
mmHg, n = 5, and 148 ± 4 mmHg, n = 5, respectively).
However, LV weight/BW was lower in the 5-HTT–/–
mutants than in the wild-type mice (Table 1).
As compared with mice maintained under normox￾ic conditions, mice exposed to 10% dioxygen exhibited
gradual increases in RVSP (Figure 3) and hematocrit
(Table 1) such that at 5 weeks (n = 8 in each group) val￾ues were higher than at 2 weeks (n = 9 in each group)

HTT+/+ and 5-HTT–/– mice. The RVSP increase during acute hypoxia was significantly larger in 5-HTT–/– than in 5-HTT+/+ mice (P < 0.01).

in mice of either genotype. However, only in 5-HTT+/+
mice was RV/LV+S significantly higher after 5 weeks
than after 2 weeks of hypoxia (P < 0.01). Whereas after
exposure to hypoxia for similar durations, BW, hema￾tocrit, and heart rate did not differ between either
genotype, RVSP was significantly lower and right ven￾tricular hypertrophy less severe in 5-HTT–/– mutants
than in 5-HTT+/+ mice (Figure 3, Table 1). Furthermore,
distal pulmonary vessel muscularization, which also
increased with the duration of hypoxia exposure, was
less marked at both the alveolar duct and the alveolar
wall levels in 5-HTT–/– than in 5-HTT+/+ mice (P < 0.01
and P < 0.001 after 2 weeks and 5 weeks of hypoxia,
respectively; Figure 4). After exposure to hypoxia for
similar durations, the normalized wall thickness of
muscular arteries (diameter < 100 µm) was smaller in
5-HTT–/– than in 5-HTT+/+ mice (Figure 5).
Lung 5-HTT expression and immunolocalization in
response to hypoxia. To evaluate the consequences of
exposure to hypoxia on lung 5-HTT expression, the lev￾els of 5-HTT protein in lung tissues were estimated
using Western blot analysis. A single immunoreactive
band (64 kDa) was observed in lungs from wild-type
mice (Figure 6). The density of this band increased after
two weeks of exposure to hypoxia (40.2 ± 4 OD vs. 23.6
± 0.7 OD arbitrary units in lungs from hypoxic and
normoxic mice, respectively; n = 5 in each group). In
contrast, the 5-HTT immunoreactive band was not
detected in lungs from 5-HTT–/– mice exposed to either
normoxia or hypoxia.
Immunohistochemical studies showed 5-HTT–like
immunostaining in endothelial and SMCs of pul￾monary vessels from wild-type mice exposed to hypox￾ia for 2 weeks (Figure 7). In contrast, only a very low
level of background staining was observed in arteries
from 5-HTT–/– mice exposed to hypoxia of the same
duration (Figure 7).
Discussion
The present results demonstrate that the 5-HTT is a
major determinant of pulmonary vascular remodeling
during exposure to chronic hypoxia. Thus, in mice lack￾ing the 5-HTT gene and exposed to hypoxia for two or
five weeks, the number and wall thickness of muscular
pulmonary vessels were decreased as compared with
wild-type controls. Concomitantly, RVSP was lower and
the RV was less hypertrophied in hypoxic 5-HTT–/–
mutants than in hypoxic wild-type mice. In contrast, the
increase in RVSP elicited by an acute hypoxic challenge
was larger in 5-HTT–/– than in 5-HTT+/+ normoxic mice.
Therefore, the attenuation of PH development and vas￾cular remodeling in the 5-HTT–deficient mice cannot be
explained by decreased pulmonary vasoreactivity to
hypoxia. These data strongly support a key role for 5-
HTT in vascular SMC proliferation and in the conse￾quent development of PH in response to hypoxia.
Hypoxia is a well-recognized stimulus for pulmonary
blood vessel remodeling. One mechanism that may
account for this effect is a direct action of hypoxia on
the expression of specific genes involved in SMC pro￾liferation. A recent study has shown that mice partial￾ly deficient in hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), an
essential mediator of transcriptional responses to
decreased dioxygen availability, have decreased devel￾opment of hypoxic PH with reduced muscularization
of distal pulmonary vessels (2). This is evidence that
specific genes expressed under the control of HIF-1
during exposure to hypoxia are involved in pulmonary
vascular SMC proliferation. Among vasoactive mole￾cules or growth factors that have been implicated in
PH, inducible nitric oxide synthase (13), heme oxyge￾nase 1 (14), VEGF (15), VEGF receptor 1 (16), and
endothelin 1 (ET-1) (17) are known to be expressed by
hypoxia-inducible genes that contain functionally
important HIF-1 binding sites. However, these mole￾cules exhibit little or no growth-promoting effects on
pulmonary SMCs, and none of them demonstrate
selective effects on the pulmonary circulation.

We reported recently that the mitogenic action of 5-
HT on rat-cultured pulmonary vascular SMCs was
enhanced by hypoxia (6). Other studies found that the
mitogenic action of 5-HT was dependent upon 5-HTT
activity in pulmonary artery SMCs from several species
but not in systemic vessel SMCs (5). Hypoxia induces
5-HTT expression in cultured SMCs through a tran￾scriptional mechanism and simultaneously increases
the mitogenic activity of 5-HT (6). Exposure to hypox￾ia also increases 5-HTT expression in the rat lung,
notably in the media of remodeled pulmonary vessels.
The presence of two hypoxia-sensitive elements in the
promoter region of the 5-HTT gene strongly suggests
that 5-HTT may be an effector molecule for pulmonary
vascular remodeling in response to hypoxia (6, 18).
However, 5-HTT activity also depends upon the levels
of 5-HT. In previous studies, we found that continuous
intravenous infusion of 5-HT worsened PH in rats
exposed to chronic hypoxia (19). This effect was pre￾vented by administration of a 5-HT transport inhibitor
despite further increases in plasma 5-HT levels (20). In
aggregate, these observations suggest that 5-HTT activ￾ity may be involved in the response to exogenous 5-HT.
However, they do not provide information on the role
of 5-HTT activity in hypoxia-induced PH in the absence
of pharmacological modulation of 5-HT.
We used 5-HTT knockout mice, which have been well
characterized in terms of locomotor activity and behav￾ior (8). Because 5-HTT is encoded by a single gene
expressed in several cell types such as neurons, platelets,
and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and SMCs, 5-
HTT deficiency can be expected to produce marked
alterations not only in central serotoninergic neuro￾transmission but also in the metabolism and actions of
indoleamine at the periphery. Under normal conditions,
5-HT is produced mainly by enterochromaffin cells in
the gut, where it plays a role in mechano- and chemo￾transduction. A large part of the 5-HT released from
enterochromaffin cells reaches the portal circulation,
where it is avidly taken up by platelets and partly metab￾olized by the liver. The remaining free 5-HT in blood is
cleared by the lung, a process that involves indoleamine
uptake by pulmonary vascular endothelial and SMCs.
In 5-HTT–/– mice, high-affinity [3H]5-HT uptake was
absent in platelets in our study and in the brain in an
earlier study (8), confirming the complete absence of 5-
HTT gene activity in these mutants. 5-HT blood con￾centrations were also dramatically reduced in the
mutants as compared with wild-type mice, an expected
finding since platelet 5-HT is known to contribute at
least 90% of whole blood 5-HT. In contrast, blood 5-
HIAA levels did not differ significantly between 5-HTT–/–
mutants and wild-type mice, suggesting an absence of
marked adaptive changes in 5-HT production and/or
degradation in the knockout animals.
The main finding from our study is that mice defi￾cient in 5-HTT developed less PH than their littermate
controls when exposed to hypoxia of various durations.
Not only was pulmonary artery pressure lower, but pul￾monary vessel muscularization and thickening were
also less marked in 5-HTT–/– mice than in wild-type con￾trols, suggesting that impaired pulmonary vascular
SMC proliferation owing directly to the deficiency in 5-
HTT–mediated 5-HT mitogenic activity was responsi￾ble for the attenuation of PH. In theory, protection
from pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH could
have resulted from other mechanisms. One is decreased
pulmonary vasoreactivity to hypoxia. However, we
found that the pulmonary pressor response to acute

Distribution of vessels according to the accompanying airway. Fifty to
60 intraacinar vessels were analysed in each lung from mice of each
genotype after exposure to hypoxia for 2 weeks (n = 9 of each geno￾type) or 5 weeks (n = 8 of each genotype). Percentages of nonmuscu￾lar (NM), partially muscular (PM), or fully muscular (M) vessels deter￾mined separately at the alveolar duct and alveolar wall levels differed
significantly between 5-HTT+/+ and 5-HTT–/– mice after exposure to
hypoxia for either 2 weeks (P < 0.01) or 5 weeks (P < 0.001).

hypoxia as evaluated based on the RVSP increase was
enhanced rather than blunted in 5-HTT–/– mice. The
explanation of this finding remains speculative. One
likely hypothesis is that the platelet uptake deficiency
left more indoleamine available for binding to 5-HT
receptors on pulmonary SMCs in 5-HTT–/– mice. In an
earlier study, we found that 5-HT infusion in rats
potentiated the in vivo acute pulmonary pressure
response to hypoxia (19). Moreover, treatment with
dexfenfluramine, which inhibits platelet 5-HT uptake
and, additionally promotes 5-HT release from platelets,
also potentiates in vivo acute hypoxic pulmonary vaso￾constriction (20). It is therefore reasonable to assume
that the deficiency in platelet 5-HT uptake in the 5-
HTT–/– mice increases hypoxic pulmonary vasoreactiv￾ity through the same mechanism. Another possibility
is that impaired 5-HT release by platelets or secondary
platelet dysfunction may account for the attenuated
pulmonary vascular remodeling in 5-HTT–/– mice. In
this regard, a comparison of our results in 5-HTT–/–
mice with those previously reported in the fawn-hood￾ed rat is of interest. Fawn-hooded rats have a genetic
deficiency in 5-HT platelet storage and a bleeding ten￾dency owing to a defect in platelet aggregation (21), but
have a normal 5-HTT amino acid sequence (22).
Although fawn-hooded rats share with 5-HTT–/– mice
an increase in pulmonary vasoreactivity to acute hypox￾ia, responses to chronic hypoxia are diametrically
opposed: hypoxia-induced PH is facilitated in fawn￾hooded rats, whereas it is attenuated in 5-HTT–/– mice.
This militates against the possibility that attenuated
remodeling in 5-HTT–/– mice was related to platelet dys￾function or to impaired 5-HT release. The increased
vascular remodeling in fawn-hooded rats is believed to
involve increased lung vessel exposure to 5-HT as a
result of the inability of platelets to store 5-HT. Togeth￾er with the fact that 5-HT infusion worsens hypoxic PH
in rats, these findings support a key role for 5-HT in
hypoxic PH, provided that 5-HTT expression and/or
activity is present in pulmonary vascular SMCs. The
observation of attenuated remodeling in our 5-
HTT–deficient mice emphasizes the importance of 5-
HTT expression by pulmonary SMCs for the develop￾ment of hypoxic PH.
At present, the mechanisms by which 5-HT may exert
its mitogenic effect after being transported inside SMCs
remain speculative. Lee et al. observed that 5-
HT–induced DNA synthesis was associated with tyro￾sine phosphorylation of GTPase-activating proteins
and that both events were blocked by inhibitors of 5-HT

the smooth muscle cells. In contrast, only a very

transport or tyrosine kinase (23). Therefore, although
5-HT–induced mitogenesis of SMCs requires cellular
internalization through 5-HTT rather than binding to
a membrane receptor, tyrosine phosphorylation of
GTPase-activating proteins appears to be a downstream
intermediate in the signaling pathway. Recently,
involvement of superoxide anion formation in associa￾tion with 5-HT transport has also been suggested as a
possible contributor to the mitogenic effects of 5-HT
(24). Since reactive oxygen species are also considered to
be potential mediators of vascular remodeling, we can￾not exclude that protection against PH in 
5-HTT–deficient mice was indirectly related to de￾creased formation of superoxide anions.
Interestingly, heart weight was lower in 5-HTT–/–
mutants than in wild-type normoxic mice, although
systemic arterial pressure did not differ between the
two groups. Clinical studies have established that 5-
HT promotes cardiac disease by causing fibroplasia,
particularly in the valvular endocardium in the right
side of the heart (25). In addition, patients treated
with the 5-HT releaser fenfluramine in combination
with phentermine have been reported to develop right
and left valvular heart disease (26). In line with these
observations, cardiac alterations may develop in 5-
HTT–/– mice as a consequence of either an excessive
amount of 5-HT reaching the heart or a deficiency in
5-HTT. Further studies are needed to explore the
nature and the mechanisms of cardiac alterations in
5-HTT–deficient mice.
The importance of 5-HT in pulmonary vascular
remodeling is generating renewed interest, in particu￾lar because several appetite suppressants that act by
inhibiting 5-HT transport have been reported to
increase the risk of PH in humans (7). However, further
investigations are needed to determine whether a link
exists between the mechanism of appetite suppres￾sant–induced human PH and the present results
demonstrating the importance of 5-HTT expression by
pulmonary SMCs for the development of hypoxic PH
in rodents. Recently, we found marked increases in 5-
HTT binding and 5-HTT activity in platelets from
patients with primary and secondary forms of PH (27).
Therefore, one reasonable hypothesis is that human
PH may be associated with 5-HTT overexpression in
platelets and/or pulmonary artery SMCs and that
appetite suppressants may act on this process. Further
studies exploring 5-HTT expression in the pulmonary
circulation of patients with primary or secondary PH
are needed to extend the present findings to nonhy￾poxic forms of human PH.
