Abstract


The 'growth fraction' of tumours can now be assessed on paraffin
sections of tissues using the monoclonal antibody MIB1 by a
microwave antigen retrieval technique. The MIB1 labelling index
was studied using a CAS 200 image analyser in 177 tumours from
women with primary operable breast carcinoma in whom long-term
follow-up data were known. Statistical analysis showed a strong
association between the MIB1 labelling index and histological grade
(P < 0.001), tumour size (P = 0.002), tumour type (P < 0.001)
and also patient survival (P < 0.001). No association with lymph
node stage (P = 0.974) or regional recurrence (P = 0.185), the
presence or absence of distant metastases (P = 0.418), patient age
(P = 0.309), menopausal status (P = 0.181) or oestrogen receptor
status (P = 0.401) was found in this group of patients. In
multivariate analysis for survival, when histological grade, lymph
node stage and tumour size were included as well as the MIB1
labelling index, each was found to be of independent significance. If
histological grade was not included, MIB1 replaced it as the most
important variable predicting for survival in this group of patients.
The results suggest that the tumour growth fraction, as assessed by
the MIB1 labelling index, is an important predictor of survival.
