(e. g., intense pruritus), or delayed surgery, or for before
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in jaundiced patients.
Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.
ESGE recommends the endoscopic placement of a 10-mm
diameter self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) for preopera￾tive biliary drainage of malignant extrahepatic biliary ob￾struction.
Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.
ESGE recommends SEMS insertion for palliative drainage of
of extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction.
Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.
ESGE recommends against the insertion of uncovered SEMS
for the drainage of extrahepatic biliary obstruction of un￾confirmed etiology.
Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

This Guideline is an official statement of the European Society
of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the indica￾tions for and results of biliary stenting as well as the choice of
stent.
1.Introduction
The Clinical Guideline on biliary stenting published in 2012 by
the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE)
made recommendations on the indications and choice of stents
for benign and malignant biliary conditions [1]. New evidence
has become available since then and is discussed in the present
update, and new recommendations are issued. The associated
Technology Review that described the models of biliary stents
available and the stenting techniques, including advanced
techniques such as insertion of multiple plastic stents (MPS),
drainage of hilar strictures, retrieval of migrated stents, and
combined stenting in patients with both malignant biliary and
duodenal obstruction, is considered up-to-date and will be re￾vised when appropriate [2].
2.Methods
ESGE commissioned this Guideline and appointed a guideline
leader (J.M.D.) who invited the listed authors to participate in
the project development. The key questions were prepared by
the coordinating team (J.M.D., A.T., C.H.) and then approved by
the other members. The coordinating team formed task force
subgroups, each with its own leader, who was assigned key
questions (see Appendix e1, available online in Supplementary
material).
Each task force performed a systematic literature search to
prepare evidence-based and well-balanced statements on their
assigned key questions. The literature search was performed
using MEDLINE and Embase to identify new publications since
January 2011 published in English, focusing on meta-analyses
and fully published prospective studies, particularly random￾ized controlled trials (RCTs), performed in humans. Retrospec￾tive analyses and pilot studies were also included if they addres￾sed topics not covered in the prospective studies. The Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluati￾on (GRADE) system was adopted to define the strength of re￾commendation and the quality of evidence [3, 4]. Each task
force proposed statements on their assigned key questions
which were discussed during a meeting in Dusseldorf, Germany
in February 2016. Literature searches were re-run in July 2017.
This time-point should be the starting point in the search for
new evidence for future updates to this guideline. In December
2017 a draft prepared by J.M.D., A.T., and J.V.H. was sent to all
group members for review. The draft was also reviewed by two

3.Malignant extrahepatic biliary
obstruction
3.1. Indications for biliary stenting
3.1.1. Preoperative biliary drainage
Preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) is common practice: a US
administrative database study (2573 patients with pancreatico￾duodenectomy) found that the PBD rate increased from 30 % to
59 % of patients between 1995 and 2007, with the majority of
PBD occurring prior to surgical consultation [5]. Neoadjuvant
therapy is increasingly used before surgery for pancreatic
adenocarcinoma and it often requires PBD (58% of 199 patients
in a prospective database) [6].
Among 10 unique meta-analyses that assessed the potential
benefit of PBD in patients with a distal biliary obstruction
(▶Table e1, available online in Supplementary material), none
found differences in terms of mortality and, with respect to
morbidity, 9 found it to be similar [7 – 12] or higher [13 – 15]
with vs. without PBD; a single study reported a lower morbidity
(serious adverse events) with vs. without PBD [16]. Although
the meta-analyses were limited by the characteristics of the
original studies, including selection bias, the use of the percu￾taneous or the endoscopic route for PBD, and the inclusion in
some studies of patients with proximal biliary obstruction,
they represent the best available evidence. Of note, two retro￾spective studies that compared PBD vs. no PBD in a total of 170
patients reported an independent association between endo￾scopic PBD and shorter patient survival [17, 18].
Apart from well-accepted indications for PBD such as chol￾angitis, severe jaundice was suggested to be an adequate indi￾cation: a recent, mostly retrospective, study (1200 patients)
found that a total serum bilirubin ≥ 300 µmol/L was associated
with a high risk of severe postoperative complications [19]. Of
note, patients with a total serum bilirubin ≥ 250 µmol/L were
excluded from the largest RCT of PBD vs. no PBD [20]. On the
other hand, a retrospective matched case – control study (152
patients) suggested that even in patients with relatively severe
jaundice (bilirubin ≥ 15 mg/dL [256 µmol/L]) classified as grade
2 on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scale, PBD
presented no advantage [21]. Thus, the validity of severe jaun￾dice as an indication for PBD remains unclear.
If a decision is made to proceed with PBD in patients with
malignant distal biliary obstruction who are undergoing cura￾tive resection, the endoscopic route is preferred over the per￾cutaneous route because data from three retrospective series
with long-term follow-up that compared the two approaches
(total, 1213 patients) showed longer patient survival and less
frequent peritoneal/liver recurrence in the endoscopic groups
[22 – 24].
With respect to the use of plastic stents vs. self-expandable
metal stents (SEMSs) for PBD, a meta-analysis (four retrospec￾tive and one prospective cohorts; total, 704 patients) found
that SEMSs were associated with a lower rate of endoscopic re￾intervention (3.4 % vs. 14.8 %) and no difference in overall surgi￾cal morbidity or mortality [25]. The interval between biliary
drainage and surgery was not reported but we calculated that
neoadjuvant therapy, an indicator of long PBD duration, was
performed in 337 (48 %) patients. In a more recent multicenter
RCT (86 patients) comparing plastic stents and fully covered
SEMSs (FCSEMSs) there were similar outcomes including need
for reintervention, surgery-related adverse events, and mortal￾ity, but the interval between biliary drainage and surgery was
only 13 days [26].
In the setting of neoadjuvant therapy, an RCT (54 patients)
found that use of FCSEMSs resulted in a longer stent patency
duration and fewer days of delay in neoadjuvant therapy com￾pared with plastic stents and uncovered SEMSs; total costs
associated with PBD were similar for all stent models [27]. Simi￾larly, two retrospective studies (total, 72 patients) found that,
compared with SEMSs, plastic stents were associated with
more complications; one of the studies also analyzed the delay
in neoadjuvant therapy and costs: with SEMSs, the delay was
shorter and the total costs were similar [28, 29]. The type of
SEMS was stated in one study only (FCSEMS) [29]. FCSEMSs
also present the advantage of being removable if surgical re￾section is finally not performed.
Finally, SEMSs do not compromise R0 resection or increase
the risk of local unresectability according to a retrospective
analysis of 593 patients [30], but the presence of a biliary plas￾tic stent or SEMS prolongs operative duration [21, 30].
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE recommends against routine preoperative biliary
drainage in patients with malignant extrahepatic biliary
obstruction; preoperative biliary drainage should be re￾served for patients with cholangitis, severe symptomatic
jaundice (e. g., intense pruritus), or delayed surgery, or
for before neoadjuvant chemotherapy in jaundiced pa￾tients.
Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE recommends the endoscopic placement of a 10-
mm diameter self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) for pre￾operative biliary drainage of extrahepatic malignant bili￾ary obstruction.
Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.

3.1.2. Palliative biliary drainage
3.1.2.1 Route for primary biliary drainage
Biliary stenting through ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic
biliary drainage (PTBD) are established techniques described
more than 40 years ago as alternatives to surgical biliodigestive
anastomosis [31, 32].
Comparison of primary biliary stenting vs. surgical bilio￾digestive anastomosis for malignant biliary obstruction has
been performed in three meta-analyses [33 – 35]; the two most
recent ones included five identical RCTs (379 patients), of which
four used ERCP and one the percutaneous approach to insert
mostly plastic stents (SEMS were used in 15 patients only); two
RCTs were added compared with the older meta-analysis [34,
35]. In the two recent meta-analyses, procedure-related com￾plications were more frequent with surgery vs. biliary stenting
as well as 30-day mortality (16.3 % vs. 9.6 % as stated by de Lima
et al. [34]; incorrectly calculated by Glazer et al. [35]); short￾term success rates were similar with both techniques but recur￾rent biliary obstruction was less frequent after surgical bypass
vs. stenting. Of note, the single RCT (30 patients) that used
SEMSs found no difference between endoscopy and surgery in
terms of late-onset complications and patient readmission
[36]. Quality of life was assessed in two RCTs, one of these re￾ported better results for endoscopic stenting [36] while the
other one reported similar results for both drainage approaches
[37]. The total duration of hospital stay, including patient read￾missions, was shorter for biliary stenting vs. surgery in all of the
five RCTs. Costs were analyzed in a single RCT: total costs (in￾cluding readmissions) with endoscopic SEMS placement were
approximately half those of surgery (4271 ± 2411 vs. 8321 ±
1821 USD) [38]. A similar difference has been reported in a
large multicenter retrospective study that included 622 pa￾tients [39].
The comparison of biliary stenting through ERCP vs. PTBD
was reported in the analysis of a national database and in two
RCTs; all of these studies included both hilar and extrahepatic
malignant biliary obstruction. The analysis of a U.S. database
(9135 patients) found a lower adverse event rate (8.6 % vs.
12.3 %), a shorter hospitalization, and lower total costs for
ERCP vs. PTBD; mortality was not reported [40]. In that study,
the lower rate of adverse events associated with endoscopic
procedures was observed regardless of the volume of PTBD
procedures performed in a center for pancreatic cancer. As
mentioned above, endoscopic biliary stenting has been asso￾ciated with longer patient survival and less frequent perito￾neal/liver recurrence in the three retrospective series with
long-term follow-up that compared this outcome for both ap￾proaches (total, 1213 patients) [22 – 24]. Finally, the two histor￾ical RCTs that compared ERCP vs. PTBD (75 and 54 patients)
yielded contradictory results in terms of success rate and mor￾tality [41, 42].
Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biliary drainage (EUS￾BD) has been more recently employed and is rapidly gaining ac￾ceptance: four meta-analyses (16 – 42 studies including 5 – 12
prospective ones; total, 528 – 1192 patients) reported that
EUS-BD was clinically successful in 87 %– 94 % of cases with ad￾verse events reported in 16 %– 29 % [43 – 46]. EUS-BD has most￾ly been used in malignant conditions (87 % of biliary obstruc￾tions in a meta-analysis that included 1186 patients) [43].
EUS-BD had a higher functional success rate in malignant vs.
benign conditions in the single meta-analysis that analyzed
that outcome, although technical success rates were similar
[45].
This technique has mostly been used following failed ERCP
(see section 5.4 for more details regarding its position in the
treatment algorithm) although it has been used in pilot trials
as a first-line option [47, 48].
3.1.2.2 Type of stent
Five meta-analyses have compared SEMSs with plastic stents
for the endoscopic drainage of distal malignant biliary obstruc￾tion (▶Table e2, available online) [49 – 53]. Compared with
plastic stents, SEMSs are associated with a longer patient survi￾val, a lower risk of stent dysfunction/cholangitis, and fewer re￾interventions. Costs associated with palliation of malignant bili￾ary obstruction with SEMSs vs. plastic stents have been com￾pared in a meta-analysis (8 RCTs, 311 patients with hilar or ex￾trahepatic malignant biliary obstruction) and in a more recent
RCT (18 centers, 219 patients with extrahepatic malignant bili￾ary obstruction) [50, 54]. No significant differences in costs
were reported in these studies and the more recent RCT
showed total costs were also similar for plastic stents vs. SEMSs
in patients with a short survival duration (≤ 3 months) or those
with metastatic disease [54]. A follow-up study (140 patients)
of that RCT showed that health-related quality of life, both gen￾eral and disease-specific, was better over time with SEMSs vs.
plastic stents [55].
Seven meta-analyses have compared covered vs. uncovered
SEMSs (▶Table e3, available online) [56 – 62]; the covered
SEMSs used in the original studies included partially covered
SEMSs (PCSEMSs) and FCSEMSs. No differences in the propor￾RECOMMENDATION
ESGE recommends that decompression of malignant
extrahepatic biliary obstruction be performed via endo￾scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
rather than by surgery or percutaneously.
Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.
ESGE recommends restricting the use of EUS-guided bili￾ary drainage to cases where biliary drainage using stand￾ard ERCP techniques has failed.
Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE recommends SEMS insertion for palliative drainage
of malignant extrahepatic biliary obstruction.
Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

tions of patients with stent dysfunction, overall complications
or patient survival were reported, except for stent dysfunction
in two meta-analyses [57, 60]. Covered SEMSs were associated
with a lower risk of tumor ingrowth but a higher risk of stent mi￾gration, tumor overgrowth, and sludge formation. With respect
to concerns about cholecystitis following covered SEMS place￾ment [63], the four meta-analyses that reported this outcome
found no increased risk of cholecystitis after insertion of cov￾ered vs. uncovered SEMS [58 – 61]. Of note, measures taken in
some studies to prevent this complication have included place￾ment of the stent covering below the level of the cystic duct
implantation in patients with an intact gallbladder [64] and
the use of covered SEMS with transmural drainage holes [65].
Finally, nitinol stents have replaced stainless steel stents as
they perform better [66, 67].
Specific SEMS designs have been investigated:
▪ Antireflux covered SEMSs were compared with SEMSs devoid
of an antireflux valve (an uncovered SEMS and a covered
SEMS) in two RCTs [68, 69]. Both RCTs reported a similar
efficacy in decreasing bilirubin serum levels and a longer
patency of antireflux vs. conventional SEMS. This is consis￾tent with the finding that duodenal-biliary reflux is inde￾pendently associated with biliary stone recurrence [70].
▪ Antimigration systems, including flared ends and anchoring
flaps, have been tested with covered SEMSs [71, 72]. An￾choring flaps have yielded promising results in patients with
benign strictures [71] but no study has compared identical
stent designs with or without an antimigration system,
precluding definitive conclusions. Stent models combining
antireflux and antimigration systems have been tested in
pilot trials [73].
▪ A radioactive stent, inserted percutaneously, provided long￾er patient survival than a similar, nonradioactive, stent in
an RCT that included 23 patients with malignant biliary
obstruction [74]. Another RCT (55 patients) that used a
radioactive strand inserted between the stent and the biliary
wall also reported prolonged patient survival [75].
▪ Paclitaxel-eluting stents provided no advantage compared
with standard SEMSs in an RCT (72 patients) [76].
Only a few studies comparing different models of plastic stent
have been published since 2011. A meta-analysis (five studies
including three RCTs, 460 patients) found that double-layer
plastic stents present a longer patency period, lower stent oc￾clusion rates, and slightly more adverse events compared to
conventional plastic stents [77]. No other specific designs
have shown a clear benefit on clinical outcomes [78 – 81].
3.1.3. Drainage of suspected malignant biliary obstruction
In large series, 5 %– 10 % of patients operated for pancreatic
cancer prove to have benign disease at surgery [82]. Uncovered
SEMSs are known to have poor long-term patency in benign dis￾ease [83]. These stents are difficult or impossible to remove
and, although a new “stent-in-stent” technique has been suc￾cessfully used to remove uncovered SEMSs mistakenly inserted
in patients with a benign disease [84, 85], this technique is la￾borious and adverse events are frequent [86].
3.1.4. Treatment of malignant bilioduodenal obstruction
No study comparing endoscopic vs. surgical approach for
combined biliary and duodenal drainage was found. Systematic
reviews or meta-analyses have compared the endoscopic and
surgical approaches for each condition separately:
▪ With respect to the bypass of a malignant obstruction of the
duodenum/gastric outlet, seven meta-analyses were found
(▶Table e4, available online) [87 – 93]: they reported a high
technical success rate for both approaches, with clinical
success more frequently observed with SEMS vs. surgery in
two meta-analyses. Five meta-analyses also reported a
shorter delay before oral intake and a shorter duration of
hospital stay with SEMS vs. surgery. Overall morbidity was
similar for both approaches except in one meta-analysis that
reported a lower morbidity with SEMS vs. surgery [89].
Among adverse events, those considered as major were
more frequent with SEMS in two meta-analyses [87, 90].
EUS-guided gastroenterostomy using lumen-apposing SEMS
(LAMS) has recently been introduced: in two retrospective
studies, it was found to provide results similar to surgery and
enteral stenting except for a lower incidence of symptom
recurrence and need for reintervention compared with
enteral stenting [94, 95];
▪ With respect to the approach for biliary drainage, the re￾commendation made above to prefer biliary stenting over
surgical bypass is even stronger in the setting of malignant
duodenal obstruction, as life expectancy of patients who
present both duodenal and biliary stricture is short: in a ret￾rospective study (81 patients with bilioduodenal stenting),
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE recommends against the insertion of uncovered
SEMS for the drainage of extrahepatic biliary obstruction
of unconfirmed etiology.
Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE suggests endoscopic insertion of a biliary SEMS and
an uncovered duodenal SEMS in patients with both biliary
and duodenal malignant obstruction.
Weak recommendation, low quality evidence.

median survival was 73 days [96]; even in patients with a
“good” prognosis identified by a higher World Health Orga￾nization (WHO) score, another study reported a median sur￾vival of 139 days [97]. Although the procedure may be tech￾nically difficult, success rates of 86 %– 100 % have been re￾ported by experts in a prospective study, with lower success
rates reported in cases where the duodenal stricture involves
the papilla [98]. The technique and sequence of biliary and
duodenal stenting according to different clinical scenarios is
detailed in the ESGE Technical Review [2]. In the case of
failed duodenal or biliary stenting, other interventions (e. g.,
PTBD, EUS-BD restricted to research settings) should be
considered [99, 100].
4. Stent dysfunction
The diagnosis of stent dysfunction has not been standardized; it
is usually based on the combination of clinical criteria and liver
function tests, complemented with transabdominal ultrasound
in some cases. Ultrasound is useful to search for biliary ductal
dilatation, liver metastases, and liver abscesses. Examples of
definitions of stent dysfunction used in RCTs are a decline in bi￾lirubin < 20% following stent insertion (failed biliary drainage),
development of cholangitis, jaundice, or a flu-like syndrome,
and cholestasis [101]. More recent RCTs have mostly used para￾clinical tests, as in the study by Schmidt et al. who defined stent
dysfunction as the presence of two of the three following crite￾ria: (a) ultrasound showing new dilatation of intrahepatic or ex￾trahepatic bile ducts; (b) bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL (34.2 µmol/L) with
an increase ≥ 1 mg/dL (17.1 µmol/L) compared to the value
after initial successful drainage, or elevation of alkaline phos￾phatases/gamma-glutamyl transferase to more than twice the
upper limit of normal values with an increase of at least 30 U/L;
(c) signs of cholangitis (fever and leukocyte count > 10 000/µL
or C-reactive protein (CRP) > 20 mg/dL) [102].
A meta-analysis (7 retrospective studies, 314 patients)
found no difference in stent reocclusion when plastic stents vs.
SEMSs were used to treat occluded SEMSs in patients with a ma￾lignant biliary obstruction (relative risk 1.24, 95%CI 0.92 – 1.67)
[103]. In a more recent RCT, 48 patients with a malignant bili￾ary obstruction who developed stent dysfunction were ran￾domized to insertion of a plastic stent, uncovered SEMS, or
PCSEMS [54]. Of these, 11 patients (23 %) again developed
stent dysfunction, 8 in the plastic stent group, 1 in the uncov￾ered SEMS group, and 2 in the PCSEMS group, with mean func￾tional durations of 170 days, 367 days, and 326 days, respec￾tively (plastic stent vs. SEMS; P = 0.026). No differences in over￾all costs were found between secondarily placed SEMSs or plas￾tic stents. Another RCT (43 patients with a nonfunctioning un￾covered SEMS in a malignant distal biliary obstruction) found no
difference in time to stent occlusion between covered vs. un￾covered SEMS (112 vs. 181 days, respectively; P > 0.05) [104].
Radiofrequency ablation was compared with the insertion of
a plastic stent in a retrospective study of 50 patients with a non￾functioning SEMS in malignant distal or proximal biliary ob￾struction: although radiofrequency ablation failed in 44 % of pa￾tients (a plastic stent was inserted), stent patency duration was
longer in the radiofrequency ablation group vs. the control
group [105].
Finally, apart from specific stent designs mentioned above,
no significant advances for the prevention of biliary stent dys￾function have been made since 2002, when a Cochrane meta￾analysis showed the absence of benefit from any systemic
treatment [106].
5. Periprocedural and technical aspects
of biliary stenting
5.1. Prophylaxis of post-ERCP pancreatitis
ESGE recommendations about the prophylaxis of post-ERCP
pancreatitis have been updated in a specific Guideline to which
the reader is referred [107]. One of its main recommendations
is to routinely administer 100mg of diclofenac or indomethacin
intrarectally immediately before or immediately after ERCP. We
cannot overemphasize this point: despite the continuing accu￾mulation of high quality evidence supporting the efficacy of
this simple measure [108] except in low risk patients [109 –
112], and the safety and the low price of diclofenac and indo￾methacin, their routine use has not been adopted by the major￾ity of endoscopists [113, 114].
5.2. Antibiotic prophylaxis
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE suggests that in a patient with a distal malignant
biliary stricture and a nonfunctioning stent, a plastic
stent should be replaced by a SEMS and, in the case of a
SEMS, a plastic stent or a new SEMS should be inserted
within the original SEMS.
Weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence.
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE recommends, for prophylaxis of post-ERCP pancrea￾titis, routine administration of 100mg of diclofenac or in￾domethacin intrarectally immediately before or immedi￾ately after ERCP in every patient with no contraindication.
Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE suggests administration of antibiotic prophylaxis
before biliary stenting in selected patients (e. g.,
immunocompromised patients, expected incomplete

Post-ERCP biliary infection is a serious complication that is
fatal in 8%– 20 % of cases and it is best prevented by complete
biliary drainage [115, 116]. A relatively old meta-analysis (5
RCTs, 1029 patients) found the risk of sepsis/cholangitis follow￾ing ERCP was not significantly decreased by routine antibiotic
prophylaxis (odds ratio [OR] 0.91, 95 % confidence interval [CI]
0.39 – 2.15) [117]. More recently, guidelines have recommen￾ded antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with expected incomplete
drainage of biliary obstruction, followed by a full antibiotic
course if adequate drainage is not achieved during the proce￾dure, as well as in patients with liver transplantation [118]. The
authors suggested that prophylactic antibiotics may also be of
benefit to patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutro￾phil count < 500 cells/µL) and/or advanced hematologic malig￾nancy.
Recent studies are summarized below:
▪ A nationwide prospective study (31 188 patients) found,
after adjustment for confounders, a 26 % risk reduction in
postoperative adverse events when prophylactic antibiotics
were used (OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.69 – 0.79) [119]; nevertheless,
the absolute risk reduction in adverse events (2.6 % in unse￾lected patients and 3.8 % in patients with obstructive jaun￾dice) was estimated to be insufficient by the authors to jus￾tify routine antibiotic prophylaxis in unselected patients;
▪ A prospective study (183 unselected patients) found similar
incidences of cholangitis with vs. without antibiotic prophy￾laxis, and all patients who developed cholangitis had incom￾plete drainage [120];
▪ A retrospective series (605 unselected patients) found that
the increase in the incidence of post-ERCP cholangitis after
routine antibiotic prophylaxis had been abandoned (1.7 % vs.
2.0 %) was not statistically significant [121]. In that study,
sclerosing cholangitis and incomplete biliary drainage were
significant risk factors for postoperative cholangitis;
▪ Another retrospective study (84 procedures, mostly in pa￾tients with sclerosing cholangitis) suggested that addition of
antibiotics and antifungal agents to the contrast medium
was associated with a lower risk of post-ERCP infectious
complications (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.11 – 0.98), in particular in
patients with incomplete biliary drainage [122].
5.3. Endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy
Two meta-analyses have compared biliary stenting with vs.
without endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy (EBS) [123, 124].
The first meta-analysis (3 RCTs, 338 patients) found that EBS
was associated with a reduced risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis
(OR 0.34, 95%CI 0.12 – 0.93) and an increased risk of bleeding
(OR 9.70, 95%CI 1.21 – 77.75); no significant difference was re￾ported in the success of stent insertion and the rate of stent mi￾gration (OR 2.31, 95%CI 0.70 – 7.63). The second meta-analysis
(5 RCTs, 12 comparative observational studies; 2710 patients)
confirmed a higher risk of bleeding with EBS (OR 8.89, 95%CI
2.76 – 28.73) but no difference in terms of post-ERCP pancrea￾titis, stent migration, or occlusion [124]. Subgroup analysis ac￾cording to the indication for biliary stenting suggested a pro￾tective effect of EBS against post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients
who had biliary stenting for bile leak (P = 0.03) and no differ￾ence if biliary stenting was indicated for biliary obstruction. A
subgroup analysis of the 6 studies (607 patients) in which
SEMS were used found no difference in the incidence of post￾ERCP pancreatitis in patients who had EBS or not. With respect
to FCSEMS, a hypothetical concern has been raised that their
coverage could obstruct the pancreatic outflow, leading to a
high incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis [125].
5.4. Failed biliary stenting
5.4.1 Repeat attempts at ERCP
ERCP initially fails in 10 %– 20 % of patients because of difficult
anatomy/inability to cannulate the papilla and to pass a guide￾wire across the stricture [126]. In such instances, the indication
for repeating biliary intervention should be carefully reconsid￾ered: in 7 studies of failed ERCP, ERCP was not repeated in 152
of 517 patients (29%) [127 – 133]; reasons stated for this choice
mostly included poor patient condition, futility, or replacement
by another procedure such as endoscopic ultrasonography￾guided sampling. In 9 studies that analyzed the role of repeat
attempt at ERCP (▶Table e5, available online), repeat ERCP
was successful in 442 of 537 patients (82 %). Of note, the three
studies that analyzed the timing of repeat ERCP found that
ERCP was more frequently successful if it was repeated at least
2 days [129, 131] or 4 days [127] after the first attempt. A sug￾gested explanation includes better visualization of the opening
of the bile duct because of decreased edema or disappearance
of submucosal injection. Factors that may favor success at re￾peat ERCP also include better patient sedation and team prepa￾ration, availability of ancillary material (e. g., specialized guide￾wires), and referral to another endoscopist in the same institu￾tion or in a high volume center. The morbidity associated with
the first and subsequent ERCPs was similar in the studies that
reported this outcome.
The reader is referred to the recent ESGE Guideline about the
techniques of papillary cannulation and EBS at ERCP that in￾cludes an evidence-based algorithm for difficult biliary cannula￾tion [134]. Of note, in patients with complex post-surgical
anatomy including Billroth II gastrectomy, ESGE suggests refer￾ral to a specialized center.
5.4.2 Role of EUS-BD
More recently, the role of EUS-BD after failed biliary stenting at
ERCP has been assessed in the literature:
▪ A meta-analysis that compared PTBD vs. EUS-BD (3 RCTs and
3 retrospective studies; total, 312 patients) found that clini￾cal success was similar with both techniques (OR 1.48, 95%CI
0.46 – 4.79) but with fewer adverse events in the EUS-BD

ESGE suggests against routine endoscopic biliary sphinc￾terotomy before the insertion of a single plastic or an un￾covered/partially covered SEMS.

group (OR 0.34, 95%CI 0.20 – 0.59); severe adverse events
accounted for this difference [135]. The reintervention rates
and costs were also lower with EUS-BD. Broadly similar find￾ings were reported in a more recent retrospective study
[136];
▪ An RCT (32 patients with a malignant distal biliary obstruc￾tion) found that, compared with surgical hepaticojejunost￾omy, EUS-BD presented a lower clinical success rate and a
higher complication rate but differences were nonsignificant
(71 % vs. 93 % and 21 % vs. 13 %, respectively) [137].
The concern has been expressed that EUS-BD might be used as
a substitute for poor ERCP technique as the analysis of > 1600
ERCPs in two tertiary referral centers has shown that EUS-BD
was required in only 0.6 % and 3.3 % of ERCPs [138, 139]. This
aspect should not be disregarded by endoscopists with more
experience in EUS-guided intervention than in ERCP.
With respect to the learning curve, a prospective study of
174 attempts at EUS-BD by a single endoscopist experienced
in both EUS and ERCP suggested that 33 cases were required
for learning EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy as procedure
duration decreased and adverse events tended to be less fre￾quent (36.4 % and 20.8 %, P = 0.12) with practice [140].
Two meta-analyses compared the extrahepatic and intrahe￾patic routes for EUS-BD in subgroup analyses that included 8
and 10 studies [43, 45]: technical and functional success rates
were similar with both routes in both studies and, in a single
study, adverse events were less frequent with the extrahepatic
vs. intrahepatic route (OR 0.40; 95%CI 0.18 – 0.87; P = 0.022)
[43]. In the particular situation of patients requiring EUS-BD
and duodenal stenting, a retrospective study (39 patients) sug￾gested that EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy could provide
longer biliary stent patency than EUS-guided choledochoduo￾denostomy [141].
With respect to stent choice, SEMSs are more frequently
used than plastic stents (525 patients and 58 patients, respec￾tively, in the meta-analysis by Wang et al. [45]); both types of
stents provided similar technical and functional success rates
but adverse events were more frequent with plastic stents vs.
SEMSs (31 % vs. 18 %) [45]. Similar results were reported in an
RCT that included 60 patients with EUS-guided choledocho￾duodenal stenting: SEMSs and plastic stents provided similar
success rates but adverse events were more frequent with plas￾tic stents (23 % vs. 13 %) and costs were lower with SEMSs [142].
Of note, fully or partially covered models of standard biliary
SEMSs are usually selected for transmural biliary drainage to
prevent bile leakage but dedicated SEMSs with a covering and
antimigration flaps on one half of the SEMS have recently been
tested [143, 144], with some models providing promising re￾sults [145 – 147]. Another promising device is a LAMS: in a
multicenter retrospective study (57 patients with failed ERCP),
LAMSs provided clinical success in 95 % of patients with adverse
events reported in 7 %. After a mean follow-up of 5 months,
stent migration occurred in one patient (2 %) [147].
6. Particular cases
6.1.Malignant hilar strictures
6.1.1. Tumor assessment and patient referral
A meta-analysis (16 studies, 651 patients) found that CT,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission to￾mography (PET)/CT present similar accuracies for assessing
resectability of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CT, 71%– 95%; MRI,
84%– 93%; PET/CT, 75%– 91%) [148, 149]. The authors ac￾knowledged that imaging techniques are often combined as
each technique may provide higher accuracy for a specific
item (e. g., vascular invasion for CT, lymph node metastasis for
PET/CT). The two studies (not included in the meta-analysis)
that compared MRI and CT in identical patients with hilar cho￾langiocarcinoma (total, 36 patients) found that both tech￾niques had similar accuracies for the evaluation of bile duct in￾volvement [150, 151]. Patients with biliary stents were exclud￾ed from these studies as from others because the staging accu￾racy of both modalities diminishes after biliary stent placement
as a result of ductal decompression and imaging artifacts [152].
Measurement of liver volumes by CT and MRI is similarly effec￾tive [153, 154]. Experience with EUS staging of hilar malignancy
remains very limited.
A meta-analysis (13 studies, 59 437 ERCPs) showed that
ERCP success is more frequent when it is performed by high vol￾ume vs. low volume endoscopists (OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.2 – 2.1) and
in high volume vs. low volume hospitals (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.6 –
2.5), while adverse events are less frequent when ERCP is per￾formed by high volume endoscopists [155]. As endoscopic
stenting in malignant hilar strictures (MHSs) is an advanced
procedure with a relatively high risk of failure, and survival is se￾verely hampered after failed drainage [156, 157], the endos￾copistʼs experience is even more important for MHSs than for
distal malignant biliary strictures, as is the prompt availability
of PTBD. Nevertheless, many patients with MHS are admitted
to referral centers with a biliary stent already in place [158].

6.1.2. Preoperative drainage of malignant hilar strictures
Two systematic reviews (11 studies, 711 patients and 9 stud￾ies, 892 patients) reported that preoperative biliary drainage of
hilar cholangiocarcinoma was associated with a higher post￾operative morbidity rate, in particular because of infections,
and no significant difference in postoperative mortality [159,
160]. However, many authors have suggested that in specific
situations (e. g., cholangitis, predicted future liver remnant vol￾ume of ≤ 30 % following surgery), preoperative drainage could
be indicated [161]. These situations have been associated with
a high risk of postoperative liver failure and may thus benefit
from portal vein embolization and drainage limited to the fu￾ture liver remnant segments [162].
With respect to the choice between the endoscopic and per￾cutaneous approaches for preoperative biliary drainage, two
meta-analyses (4 retrospective studies, 433 patients, and 3 ret￾rospective studies, 265 patients) reported a similar [163] or
higher [164] procedure-related morbidity for ERCP vs. PTBD.
On the other hand, a large, more recent, retrospective study
(280 patients) found that major postoperative morbidity was
more frequent after PTBD vs. ERCP for drainage of MHS [165].
A single meta-analysis analyzed long-term survival; it was
shorter following PTBD vs. ERCP (30 % vs. 46 % at 5 years)
[163]. A similarly shorter patient survival following PTBD vs.
ERCP was reported in three large retrospective studies (793 pa￾tients) not included in the meta-analyses [166 – 168]. Perito￾neal metastasis was more frequent following PTBD vs. ERCP; it
may be associated with the duration of PTBD (60 days or more)
and the presence of multiple PTBD catheters [169]. A similar as￾sociation between preoperative PTBD and shorter survival has
not been found in a Western bicentric study (245 patients)
with a different use of PTBD catheters [170].
If endoscopic preoperative drainage of MHS is performed,
plastic stents or nasobiliary drains are preferred [171]; al￾though less comfortable for the patient, nasobiliary drains are
preferred in particular by Japanese authors because of the low￾er incidence of cholangitis due to tube occlusion [172]. The use
of SEMSs for preoperative drainage of MHS is discouraged be￾cause of the paucity of the literature [173] and the risk of pre￾cluding curative surgery.
6.1.3. Palliative drainage of malignant hilar strictures
A meta-analysis (7 retrospective studies and 2 RCTs, 546 pa￾tients) found that PTBD was more frequently successful than
ERCP for palliation of Bismuth types III and IV MHS (OR 2.53,
95%CI 1.57 – 4.08) [174]. Overall adverse events and 30-day
mortality were similar for both approaches. Bismuth types I
and II MHS were not included in the meta-analysis because
ERCP was believed to represent the optimal approach for pallia￾tive drainage of such strictures. Of note, drainage of Bismuth
type I MHS is technically similar to that of extrahepatic biliary
strictures. The value of this meta-analysis is limited by the fact
that most data were retrospective, including three noncom￾parative studies. With respect to quality of life, it improves
with both approaches [175, 176] but an RCT (54 patients) sug￾gested that some health parameters improve more with PTBD
vs. ERCP [177].
An RCT (54 patients with a potentially resectable hilar cho￾langiocarcinoma) reported a higher perioperative mortality
with PTBD vs. ERCP [178]. In a retrospective study (110 patients
with a Bismuth type III and IV MHS), failed endoscopic biliary
drainage was associated with an acute angle between the com￾mon bile duct (CBD) and the left hepatic duct at pre-drainage
imaging; this could help to decide on the best individual ap￾proach in centers where ERCP is used for draining Bismuth
types III and IV MHS [179].
The minimal proportion of liver volume, excluding tumor
volume, that should be drained was analyzed in a retrospective
study (78 patients): serum bilirubin dropped by ≥ 50% if 33% or
50 % of liver volume was drained in patients with either normal
liver function/compensated cirrhosis or decompensated cirrho￾sis, respectively [180]. These results are in line with prior stud￾ies [181, 182]; one of these also showed a lower incidence of

cholangitis and longer patient survival with endoscopic drain￾age of > 50 % of the liver volume [182].
Unilateral and bilateral drainage of MHS have been compar￾ed in three meta-analyses [53, 183, 184]. Two of these (7 stud￾ies, 634 patients; 4 studies, 562 patients) found a significant
difference only in the success of stent insertion (higher with
unilateral stenting) while other outcomes were similar, includ￾ing therapeutic success, cumulative stent patency, complica￾tions, and survival. The third meta-analysis (28 mostly noncom￾parative studies, 2132 patients) reported the following: (i) for
plastic stents, no difference for any outcome, including success
of stent insertion, overall complications, and 30-day mortality;
(ii) for SEMSs, a higher technical success rate, more overall ad￾verse events, less decrease in serum bilirubin, and similar 30-
day mortality with unilateral vs. bilateral stenting [183]. In
these meta-analyses, the only study that randomized patients
to unilateral vs. bilateral stenting used plastic stents, which are
no longer standard of care. More recently, a multicenter RCT
(133 patients with MHS of Bismuth type ≥ II treated with SEMSs)
addressed most biases of the studies included in the above￾mentioned meta-analyses, namely the inclusion of patients
with Bismuth type I MHS that can be fully drained with a single
stent, the use of both SEMS and plastic stent, and the inclusion
of patients undergoing palliative drainage as well as PBD: bilat￾eral drainage resulted in fewer reinterventions and a more dur￾able stent patency (median 252 vs. 139 days) [185].
Contrast-free deep cannulation into the ductal systems to be
drained has been proposed to prevent post-ERCP cholangitis, a
frequent complication after injection of obstructed ducts that
are not subsequently drained [186 – 188]. In this technique,
pre-ERCP imaging is used as a road map to insert a guidewire
into the desired obstructed duct(s) while avoiding injection of
contrast medium upstream from the stricture; once the stric￾ture has been crossed bile is aspirated and contrast medium is
injected before stent insertion. Various contrast media have
been used: air, carbon dioxide (CO2) (to decrease the risk of
gas embolism), or iodine contrast. Some authors have pro￾posed no use of contrast at all, delineating the stricture with
the waist of the SEMS [189]. Two RCTs (85 patients) [190, 191]
and two retrospective studies (235 patients) [192, 193] found
that post-ERCP cholangitis was less frequent if air/CO2 rather
than iodine contrast was used for cholangiography in patients
with Bismuth type ≥ II hilar stricture. Three uncontrolled studies
have reported a low (0 – 6 %) rate of post-ERCP cholangitis using
iodine contrast for injection upstream from the MHS [194, 195]
or using no contrast medium injection [189].
Plastic stents and SEMSs have been compared in three meta￾analyses; one of these included three RCTs (188 patients) [50]
and the two others included, in addition to these, one prospec￾tive and two retrospective studies (total, 800 patients) [51, 53].
One meta-analysis of RCTs showed better results with SEMSs in
terms of stent dysfunction (risk difference −0.17, 95%CI −0.28
to −0.06), reintervention (risk difference −0.30, 95%CI −0.54 to
−0.06), and mean survival (159 vs. 99 days) [50], while the
other meta-analyses reported that SEMSs were also associated
with less therapeutic failure (OR 0.28, 95%CI 0.13 – 0.63) [51,
53]. SEMSs are cost-effective according to one RCT [196] and a
decision analytic model [197], but not according to a retrospec￾tive study [198]. Uncovered SEMS were used in all studies ex￾cept a recent retrospective series (30 patients) that reported
encouraging results with a 6-mm diameter FCSEMS, although
liver abscesses were reported in 7 % of patients because of a
stent crossing a duct bifurcation; in this pilot study removable
FCSEMS were used to prevent stent ingrowth and to facilitate
reintervention [199]. Of note, if a decision for palliation has
not been taken, plastic stents are recommended because re￾moval of uncovered SEMSs is usually not possible [200].
The “side-by-side” and “stent-in-stent” positioning of multi￾ple SEMSs have been found equivalent in a meta-analysis (4
studies, 158 patients) with respect to the rates of successful
stent placement, successful drainage, early and late complica￾tions, and stent occlusions [201]. The choice of the technique
thus seems to be at the discretion of the endoscopist, with the
“side-by-side” and “stent-in-stent” techniques more frequently
used in Western and Asian countries, respectively. The insertion
of side-by-side SEMSs has become easier with the availability of
small-diameter delivery catheters that can be passed simulta￾neously in a standard therapeutic channel duodenoscope and
permit simultaneous SEMS deployment [202]. Different pre￾cautions should be taken with each technique (e. g., with the
“side-by-side” technique, the SEMSs should cross the papilla or
their lower extremities should be positioned at the same level in
the CBD to facilitate further stent access).
Dysfunction of plastic stents is treated by stent removal,
cleaning of ductal debris, and SEMS insertion, unless the diag￾nosis is not yet clear or patient life expectancy is very limited.
In the case of SEMS occlusion, cleaning of ductal debris with a
balloon is suggested, followed by cholangiographic assessment
of the degree of tissue ingrowth/overgrowth and subsequent
insertion of an inner plastic stent or SEMS [203]; a retrospective
study (52 patients) reported a longer patency (131 days vs. 47
days) with SEMSs vs. plastic stents [204]. Radiofrequency abla￾tion might be an alternative option although data are sparse
and comparison with insertion of a plastic stent has been re￾ported in only one retrospective study [205].
6.2. Benign strictures
Endoscopy has become the preferred option for treating be￾nign biliary stricture (BBS) [206 – 209]. Endoscopic treatment is
performed mostly for BBSs related to liver transplantation or
chronic pancreatitis (one third of cases each) and, less fre￾quently, to other causes (e. g., post-cholecystectomy and
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE recommends temporary insertion of multiple plas￾tic stents or of a fully covered SEMS for treatment of be￾nign biliary strictures.
Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.
The choice between the two strategies depends on the
etiology of the stricture, its location, the CBD diameter,
and endoscopist experience.

post-sphincterotomy strictures); about 85 % of BBSs are located
at the level of the CBD [210].
Treatment of BBSs with a single plastic stent or uncovered
SEMS has long been abandoned because of poor long-term re￾sults [211, 212]. A meta-analysis (four RCTs, 213 patients)
found that temporary insertion of either MPS or of a covered
SEMS for the treatment of BBSs of various origins provided sim￾ilar results (ORs [95%CIs] for stricture resolution, recurrence,
and adverse events, respectively: 1.07 [0.97 – 1.18], 0.88
0.48 – 1.63], and 1.16 [0.71 – 1.88]) [213]. Fewer ERCPs were
required with covered SEMSs (mean difference −1.71, 95%CI
−2.34 to −1.09). The largest RCT included in the meta-analysis
(112 patients) did not include patients with a BBS located
within 2 cm from the hepatic confluence, a CBD diameter
< 6 mm, or an intact gallbladder in whom the cystic duct would
have been overlapped by a FCSEMS. The two RCTs (20 patients)
that analyzed the costs of each treatment found it was approxi￾mately half with the use of covered SEMSs [214, 215].
Stricture recurrence after endoscopic treatment is usually
managed with repeat endoscopic stent placement [216, 217].
With plastic stents, the current strategy consists in inserting
an increasing number of plastic stents every 3 – 4 months even
though some authors have proposed different intervals for
stent exchange [218 – 220]. The criteria used for treatment ter￾mination have included complete morphologic disappearance
of the stricture, passage of a balloon biliary catheter, or a fixed
12-month stenting duration [218, 221, 222]. In most series the
stenting duration has been approximately 12 months; a retro￾spective study (156 patients) reported that stricture recurrence
was independently associated with a stricture diameter of less
than 75 % compared to that of the surrounding CBD at the end
of treatment while the association with stenting duration was
significant in univariate analysis only [223].
With respect to SEMSs, partially covered SEMS have been re￾placed by FCSEMS in this indication because tissue hyperplasia
can develop through the bare ends, complicating SEMS removal
or causing biliary stricture [224 – 227]. Stent migration is the
most frequent adverse event related to FCSEMS (9 % in a meta￾analysis of 37 studies, 1677 patients) [228] and it is associated
with a 80 % decrease in the odds of stricture resolution [229,
230]. Stent designs aimed at preventing stent migration in￾clude flared ends (Wallflex), anchoring fins (Viabil, Hanaro)
and a short stent length allowing complete intrabiliary stent
deployment (Taewoong) [231]. Anchoring fins were more ef￾fective than flared ends to reduce stent migration in a retro￾spective study (134 patients) but some models have been asso￾ciated with traumatic biliary mucosal lesions and possibly the
development of de novo biliary strictures, including after stent
removal (8.1 % of 37 patients in a retrospective study) [232,
233].
The ideal duration of FCSEMS dwell is unknown; in a meta￾analysis (37 studies, 1677 patients), the median stenting dura￾tion was 4.4 months [228]; another meta-analysis (22 studies,
1298 patients) found a lower stricture recurrence with 6 vs. 3
months or less of stent therapy [213].
With respect to the need for EBS before FCSEMS insertion for
this indication, it has been performed in most series [227]; a
retrospective series reported a very high incidence of post￾ERCP pancreatitis (50.0 %, including one fatal case) that de￾creased to 12.5 % once EBS was routinely performed [125].
6.2.1. Benign biliary strictures related to chronic
pancreatitis
An RCT (60 patients with chronic pancreatitis) found that
MPS and covered SEMSs provided similar success rates 2 years
after stent removal (88.0 % vs. 90.9 %, respectively) with similar
treatment-related morbidity (23.3 % vs. 28.6 %, respectively)
[234]. The stenting duration was 6 months in both groups and
the removal of covered SEMS was problematic in 4 of 28 pa￾tients (14.3 %) because of stent fracture (n = 3) and embedment
(n = 1), mostly at the beginning of the authors’ experience
when partially covered SEMS were used (FCSEMS were used
once they became available).
A systematic review concluded that covered SEMSs provided
better results than MPS in chronic pancreatitis-related biliary
strictures, but it included noncomparative studies only and sin￾gle plastic stents were used in a significant proportion of pa￾tients in all of the three studies labeled as MPS (e. g., 33 % in
the study by Eickhoff et al.) [235, 236].
Patient compliance may be particularly problematic in pa￾tients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, and biliary bypass
surgery (e. g., hepaticojejunostomy) remains a valid option for
noncompliant patients or if the stricture does not respond to
biliary stenting [237].
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE suggests, for multiple plastic stenting, insertion of
the maximum number of stents possible every 3 – 4
months for a total duration of 12 months and, for treat￾ment with FCSEMS, insertion of an 8 – 10-mm diameter
FCSEMS for a dwell stenting period of 6 months.
Weak recommendation, low quality evidence.
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE suggests the temporary insertion of multiple plastic
stents or of an FCSEMS for treating benign biliary stric￾tures related to chronic pancreatitis.

6.2.2. Benign anastomotic biliary strictures following liver
transplantation
Anastomotic biliary strictures (ABSs) are more frequent fol￾lowing living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) vs. deceased
donor liver transplantation (DDLT); LDLT-related ABSs are also
more difficult to treat, with risks of technical treatment failure
and of stricture recurrence being 23 % and 25 % higher, respec￾tively [238]. Predictors of failed endoscopic treatment of LDLT￾related ABSs include higher liver transplantation recipient age,
longer operation duration, pouched morphology of the ABS,
multiple ductal anastomosis, and persistent bile leak [239 –
241]. The treatment of LDLT-related ABSs is performed in
highly specialized centers and its modalities are not considered
in the current Guideline.
Three RCTs (20, 58, and 64 DDLT recipients) compared cov￾ered SEMS vs. MPS for the treatment of ABSs: two RCTs reported
no difference between groups except for a lower number of
ERCPs with FCSEMSs vs. MPS [214, 242], while the largest RCT
reported higher stricture recurrence and adverse event rates
with covered SEMSs vs. MPS (32.0 % vs. 0 % and 23.3 % vs. 6.4 %,
respectively) (the authors did not mention whether SEMSs were
fully or partially covered) [215]. These RCTs were not included
in a review of 13 noncomparative studies (601 patients) which
reported that, in patients with an ABS following DDLT, the stric￾ture resolution rates were higher with MPS vs. FCSEMSs (87.2 %
vs. 61.8 %) while recurrence and adverse event rates were similar
[243].
6.2.3. Post-cholecystectomy benign biliary strictures
A single RCT (31 patients) compared MPS (average 4.8
stents) vs. PCSEMSs (8 – 10-mm diameter) in patients with
BBSs mostly related to cholecystectomy [244]. Adverse event
rates were similar with both types of stent and, based on MRI,
long-term success was stated to be better with PCSEMSs (81.7%
vs. 71.9 %). However, the significance is doubtful because of the
low number of patients and the uncommon, undetailed, meas￾ure of success. In the largest RCT that compared MPS vs.
FCSEMSs, only 4 of 112 patients (3.6 %) had postoperative inju￾ries that were not related to liver transplantation as many post￾cholecystectomy strictures occur too close to the hepatic con￾fluence to accommodate SEMS [245].
On the other hand, the study with the longest follow-up
available (> 13 years) used MPS and reported no stricture recur￾rence in 88.6 % of 35 patients followed retrospectively [216].
Similar results were reported by the same group of authors in
a cohort extended to 164 patients with a follow-up of 7 years;
notably half of the patients had a post-cholecystectomy BBS
that involved the main hepatic confluence, a feature that has
become more frequent with the advent of laparoscopic chole￾cystectomy [246]. For BBSs located > 2 cm from the main hepa￾tic confluence FCSEMS can present the advantage of fewer
ERCPs and shorter treatment.
6.3. Biliary leaks
Various forms of endoscopic treatment, i. e., biliary stenting,
EBS, and nasobiliary drainage, are highly effective to treat bili￾ary leaks except in the case of transection of a large duct; of
note the time lapse between biliary injury and endoscopic
treatment does not seem to affect important outcomes [247].
Some of the available treatment options were compared in
three RCTs. One of these (27 patients) found that fistulas tend￾ed to close more rapidly with biliary stenting vs. EBS [248]. An￾other RCT (52 patients) found no difference in terms of efficacy
between the placement of a plastic stent alone or combined
with EBS [249]. With respect to the stent diameter, an RCT (63
patients) reported similar proportions of patients with leak clo￾sure using 7-Fr vs. 10-Fr plastic stents [250]. The duration of
stenting has not been specifically investigated; it is 4 – 8 weeks
in many studies.
In patients with a post-cholecystectomy bile leak that persis￾ted following the insertion of a single plastic stent, FCSEMSs
were superior to MPS in a comparative nonrandomized study
(40 patients) [251].
EBS alone is attractive because it does not imply repeat
endoscopy but this advantage should be balanced against po￾tential short-term and long-term complications. The latter con￾sist of cholangitis and pancreatitis (OR 1.7 [95%CI 1.3 – 2.4] and
1.5 [95%CI 1.0 – 2.4], respectively, compared with adequate
controls at a median follow-up of 15 years) [252].
RECOMMENDATION
ESGE suggests temporary insertion of multiple plastic
stents for the treatment of benign anastomotic biliary
strictures following orthotopic liver transplantation
pending further evidence about FCSEMS.
Weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence

Case series suggest that temporary transpapillary biliary
drainage may also be effective to treat bile leaks due to liver re￾sections [253, 254].
Bilomas are a frequent complication of biliary leaks that may
require drainage; this is traditionally performed percutaneously
but several case series have reported its feasibility under EUS
guidance [255]. A retrospective series (27 patients with liver
abscess) has reported a trend for better results as well as a sig￾nificantly shorter hospital stay for EUS-guided vs. percutaneous
drainage [256]. Nevertheless, more data are needed before this
approach may be recommended in specific situations [257,
258].
6.4 Failed extraction of biliary stones
If CBD stones cannot be removed during ERCP because of
patient condition or technical factors, a biliary stent may be in￾serted to both drain the bile ducts and facilitate delayed stone
extraction, as stone size will decrease by a mean of 50 % in 2 – 6
months [259]. An RCT in 86 frail patients has shown that short￾term complications tend to be less frequent with this strategy
compared with attempted CBD stone removal [260].
Plastic stents have been used in most studies and no com￾parison between the different types and diameters is available.
A meta-analysis (6 studies, 885 patients) showed that the risk
of cholangitis is highly increased with permanent stenting vs.
elective stent exchange (OR 5.32, 95%CI 2.23 – 12.68) [259].
Therefore, stenting for biliary stones should be considered a
temporary measure until bile duct clearance is achieved. The
ideal timeframe for stent exchange has not been defined. An
RCT (78 patients) has reported a lower incidence of cholangitis
following the insertion of a 10-Fr stent if the stent was exchan￾ged every 3 months vs. on demand [261]. These findings are in
line with a retrospective study (64 patients) that reported a
higher stent patency rate at 3 months with two plastic stents
vs. one [262].
FCSEMSs have been used in six retrospective series (total 160
patients) [263] and stones were successfully removed in 127 of
144 attempted cases (88 %), most often with a simple balloon
sweep. Adverse events were noted in 29 cases (18 %) and the
cost–effectiveness has not been compared with that of plastic
stents.
7. Stent registry
Measures should be taken to avoid leaving biliary stents in
place for too long, as “forgotten” stents may be extremely dif￾ficult to remove (requiring surgery in 76 % of 21 patients in a
retrospective series) and caused death in 6.7 % of patients in a
prospective series [264]. Maintaining a registry of stents inser￾ted with the purpose of recalling patients due for stent ex￾change or removal allowed a decrease in the incidence of
stent-related sepsis in an Australian endoscopy unit [265]. An
RCT (48 patients) showed that mobile phone reminder messa￾ges may increase patient adherence to stent removal/exchange
[266]. Of course, patient compliance with repeat interventions
should be ensured prior to treatment.
