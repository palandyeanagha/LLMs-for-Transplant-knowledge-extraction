We investigated whether concurrent infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in China, a hyperepidemic area
for these infections, was associated with a higher risk of causing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than each infection alone in a meta￾analysis in China, 32 case – control studies involving 3201 cases and 4005 controls, identified from a computer-based literature search
from 1966 to 2004. The pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for HBsAg positivity was 14.1 (95% CI: 10.6 – 18.8); for
anti-HCV/HCV RNA positivity was 4.6 (95% CI: 3.6 – 5.9); for HBsAg positivity and anti-HCV/HCV RNA negativity were 15.6 (95%
CI: 11.5 – 21.3); for HBsAg negativity and anti-HCV/HCV RNA positivity were 8.1 (95% CI: 5.0 – 13.0); and positivity for both HBsAg
and anti-HCV/HCV RNA was 35.7 (95% CI: 26.2 – 48.5). We conclude that HBV and HCV infections are important independent risk
factors for HCC in China, and that dual infection by HBV and HCV is associated with a higher risk of causing HCC than each infection
alone, suggesting a synergism between HBV and HCV.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common
malignant neoplasm in the world, and the third most common
cause of cancer-related death (Parkin et al, 2001). More than
500 000 new cases are currently diagnosed yearly, with an age￾adjusted worldwide incidence of 5.5 –14.9 per 100 000 population
(Llovet et al, 2003). About 110 000 persons die each year from HCC
in China, which accounts for 45% of the deaths from HCC
worldwide. China is also a hyperepidemic area for hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection (with an estimated carrier rate exceeding 10% in
the general population) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
(with a prevalence of anti-HCV 3.1% of in the general population)
(Xuezhong et al, 1999). HBV and HCV infections have each been
shown to markedly increase the risk of developing HCC. In China,
HBV has, for several decades, been the major cause of liver disease
(Tang, 2001). Soon after the identification of HCV and the
development of testing HCV infection, it has become increasingly
evident that chronic HCV infection also plays an important role in
chronic hepatic disease including HCC (Yano et al, 1993; Tsai et al,
1994). There have been several meta-analyses of the relation of
HBV and HCV infections to HCC in China, but the relation of dual
infection to HCC has not received similar attention. In fact, this is
not rare in HCC patients and a higher morbidity in HCC patients
with dual infection has been reported than in those with one
infection (Benvegnu et al, 1994). The main difficulty in evaluating
the relationship of dual infection to HCC is the rarity of concurrent
infection in subjects without clinically evident liver disease. Only
large case – control studies that include people unaffected by
chronic liver diseases as controls can allow the interaction to be
properly assessed. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the
interaction between HBV and HCV infections among 32 case –
control studies of HCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources
We searched the published Chinese literature from 1979 to
February 2004 and Medline database from 1966 to February 2004
to identify case – control studies of the combined effect of HBV and
HCV in causing HCC using the search textwords ‘hepatocellular
carcinima’ and ‘HCV’ or ‘hepatitis non-A, non-B virus’. We also
did a full manual search from bibliographies of selected papers.
Studies were identified by two researchers independently and the
two lists compared and discrepancies resolved. We also contacted
the authors of studies containing relevant information who did not
report their results suited to this analysis. Unpublished data were
also accepted if an abstract was available and further information
was obtained from the author. We contacted most of the journals
on gastroenterology, hepatology and epidemiology in China for
studies in press.
Study criteria
(i) Each case – control study was required to have published details
of the number of participants and age-adjusted or age-matched

Epidemiology

odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). (ii) We included
only the studies that used the following serological markers of
chronic viral infections: HBsAg for HBV infection, and anti-HCV
(tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) or HCV
RNA (detected by reverse transfusion polymerase chain reaction
(RT –PCR) for HCV infection. When data were available on both
anti-HCV and HCV RNA tests, we used only the former for
classifying subjects as positive or negative for HCV infection. (iii)
Only studies were included that selected HCC patients as cases and
subjects without chronic liver diseases as controls; blood donors
and patients on usual blood transfusion, regular haemodialysis or
peritoneal dialysis were not considered eligible as controls. (iv)
The studies were ineligible if HBsAg positive subjects were
excluded from controls. (v) Studies with less than 20 cases were
excluded, since they could not detect any case positive for both
HBsAg and anti-HCV/HCV RNA. (vi) When more than one
publication from the same study was available, only the final one
was used.
Data extraction
Data were independently extracted from each study using
predefined forms, and disagreement was resolved by consensus.
The following information was extracted: the area where studies
were performed; number of cases and controls; mean age of case￾and control-groups; type of controls; number of cases and controls
for each category of HBV and HCV infections; the OR and 95% CI
for each category of HBV and HCV infections. The most fully
adjusted OR and 95% CI were extracted from each paper.
Statistical methods
The pooled OR and 95% CI were calculated from raw study data
using the Mantel –Haenszel method (fixed effect model) as
modified by Robbins et al (1986) or the DerSimonian – Laird
method (random-effect model) (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986).
When there was significant heterogeneity, the random-effect
model was used; otherwise the fixed-effect model was used.
Evidence of heterogeneity in the estimate of effect was checked
using the Breslow-Day test. A linear regression of the reported
ORs, or the ORs calculated by us, was also performed by a fixed
effect weighted-mean/linear-regression analysis, using the OR
variances as weights. Synergism between HBV and HCV infections
was assessed by the method of Rothman (1986). To determine the
source of heterogeneity, we analysed subgroups of case – control
studies according to the following characteristics: type of controls
(hospital vs community controls); geographical area (higher
incidence area for HCC vs lower, the cutoff incidence being 30
per 100 000 population). (Studies in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong,
Guangxi, Fujian, Hainan were classified as higher incidence, and
studies in other provinces as lower).
RESULTS
A total of 32 case – control studies satisfied the inclusion criteria
(Xu et al, 1990; Gong et al, 1993; Zhang et al, 1993, 1998; Ye et al,
1994; Zhou et al, 1994; Fan et al, 1995a, b; Pan et al, 1995; Wang

2002; Wang, 2003; Wu et al, 2003; Zeng et al, 2003; Ding et al,
2004). Their basic characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of
31 articles were published in Chinese and one in English. They
included a total of 3201 cases and 4005 controls. Most studies took
subjects, as controls, who were of the same sex, lived in the same
area or saw a doctor at the same hospital as the cases. Mean age
was not reported in 14 studies, but in most of these, the disparity
in age between cases and controls was less than 3 or 5 years. Most
studies showed no difference in mean age or in sex between cases
and controls.
The summary OR and 95% CI for positivity for both HBsAg and
anti-HCV/HCV RNA in the studies overall are presented in Table 2
by geographical area and type of controls. The test for hetero￾geneity showed significant differences (Po0.001) between studies
whether considered overall or in subgroups. In the higher
incidence areas, the summary ORs for HBsAg positivity and for
anti-HCV/HCV RNA positivity were slightly higher than those
found in lower incidence areas. The OR for HBsAg positivity using
community controls was significantly higher than that with
hospital controls. The OR for anti-HCV/HCV RNA positivity
using community controls was rather similar to that using hospital
controls.
The OR and 95% CI for each HBsAg and anti-HCV/HCV RNA
combination in case and control groups are set out in Table 3 and
4. Large differences were observed, most studies showing a strong
and statistically significant association between each marker and
HCC. A very low proportion of cases unexposed to either marker
was found in one study, which gave exceptionally high OR
estimates for both HBsAg and anti-HCV/HCV RNA (Zhao et al,
2000). The proportion of HCC patients with anti-HCV/HCV RNA
positivity was 19.13% among HBsAg positive patients and 28.01%
among HBsAg negative patients in the studies overall (Po0.001).
The corresponding proportions for reports using community
controls were 15.46 and 21.70% (Po0.01), respectively, and using
hospital controls, 22.84 and 32.01% (Po0.01).
The summary OR for each HBsAg and anti-HCV/HCV RNA
combination are reported in Table 5. In the studies overall, the OR
for HBsAg positivity in anti-HCV/HCV RNA negative subjects was
15.6 (95% CI: 11.5 –21.3), the OR for anti-HCV/HCV RNA
positivity in HBsAg negative subjects was 8.1 (95% CI: 5.0 –13.0)
and the OR for positivity for both markers was 35.7 (95% CI: 26.2 –
48.5). The corresponding ORs for studies using community
controls were 19.9 (95% CI: 12.4 –32.0), 11.1 (95% CI: 5.7 –21.7)
and 39.5 (95% CI: 22.9 –68.1), respectively. The corresponding ORs
for reports using hospital controls were 11.9 (95% CI: 7.9 –17.8),
5.9 (95% CI: 3.1 –11.4) and 44.9 (95% CI: 27.2 –74.1). The
corresponding ORs for studies in the higher incidence area were
14.6 (95% CI: 9.9 –21.4), 8.1 (95% CI: 4.5 –14.7) and 34.0 (95% CI:
23.4 –49.5), and in the lower incidence area 17.3 (95% CI: 10.2 –
29.4), 7.8 (95% CI: 3.4 –17.8) and 39.3 (95% CI: 22.9 –67.6).
Significant heterogeneity was found in the studies overall and in
the subgroups (Po0.001).
DISCUSSION
This study represents a quantitative assessment of published data
on the role of chronic HBV and HCV infections in causing HCC in
China. The studies included differed widely in their OR estimates
for each infective marker. Even after grouping the studies by
geographical area and type of controls, we found significant
differences within subgroups. However, in almost all studies, we
found a strong association between HCC and positivity for both
HBsAg and anti-HCV/HCV RNA, with summary OR 14.1 for
HBsAg positivity and 4.6 for anti-HCV/HCV RNA positivity. In
1994, Zhao et al (1994) reported a summary OR for HBsAg
positivity in HCC in China of 13.43, rather similar to our finding,
indicating that the strength of the association in China has not
altered much in the last decade. In 1998, Donato et al reported a
summary OR for HBsAg positivity in HCC worldwide of 13.7, little
different from that in western countries.
In 1997, Ge et al (1997) reported a summary OR for anti-HCV
positivity in HCC in China of 6.7 and other workers reported a
summary OR worldwide of 11.5 (Donato et al, 1998), while the

Epidemiology

summary OR in the present analysis of 4.6 was significantly lower
than these. This is mainly due to the fact that the ORs for anti￾HCV/HCV RNA positivity in HCC of most studies after 1997 were
not high, especially in the larger of the studies (Yu et al, 1997; Gao
et al, 1998; Li et al, 1999; Ding et al, 2004). The studies performed
before 1997 mainly used the first or second generation anti-HCV
test with low sensitivity and specificity, while since then third
generation anti-HCV test and RT – PCR have been widely used with
improved sensitivity and specificity. The OR for HBsAg positivity
and for anti-HCV/HCV RNA positivity using hospital controls in
this analysis were 10.5 and 4.4, both lower than the corresponding
estimates using community controls (18.0 and 4.7), probably
because chronic infections by HBV and HCV were more prevalent
in hospital patients than those in the general population (Donato
et al, 1998).
The above studies did not evaluate the dual infection by HBV
and HCV as in our analysis. The OR for HBsAg positivity anti￾HCV/HCV RNA negativity and for HBsAg negativity anti-HCV/
HCV RNA positivity in this analysis were 15.6 and 8.0, respectively.
Although these indicate a strong association between each
infection alone and HCC in China, the corresponding ORs
worldwide of 22.5 and 17.3 were significantly higher, especially
for HCV, showing that the risk is higher in western countries. In
fact, the proportion of HCC patients for anti-HCV/HCV RNA
positivity was 19.13% among HBsAg positive patients and 28.01%
among HBsAg negative patients, and the corresponding propor￾tions worldwide were 19.3 and 35.8% (Donato et al, 1998), which
also supported the results. All the above results indicate that
chronic infection by HBV and HCV alone were independent high
risk factors for HCC.
The proportion showing positivity for both HBsAg and anti￾HCV/HCV RNA in HCC patients was 13.78% in the studies overall,
12.13% in studies using hospital controls and 15.88% in studies
using community controls, while the proportion in controls overall
was only 1.37% (Donato et al, 1998). The proportion of positivity

HBV and HCV. Our OR for positivity for both HBsAg and anti￾HCV/HCV RNA was 35.7 in the studies overall, 44.9 in studies
using hospital controls and 39.5 using community controls.
Donato et al (1998) reported a corresponding overall OR of 135,
34.6 for hospital controls and 420 using community controls,
which differ appreciably from our results. The low sensitivity and
specificity of anti-HCV testing in early years and low dual infection
rate by HBV and HCV in western countries might account for the
differences. Donato et al (1998) reported only 14 persons positive
for both HBsAg and anti-HCV/HCV RNA in 6988 controls,
whereas there were 55 ones in 4005 controls in this analysis,
showing that the dual infection rate by HBV and HCV in general
population in China was significantly higher than that in western
countries (1.37 vs 0.20%, Po0.001).
In this analysis, the OR for positivity for both HBsAg and anti￾HCV/HCV RNA was higher than the sum of the OR for HBsAg
positivity anti-HCV/HCV RNA negativity and for HBsAg negativ￾ity anti-HCV/HCV RNA positivity, 35.7 vs 23.7 in total studies, 44.9
vs 17.8 in studies using hospital controls and 39.5 vs 31.0 in studies
using community controls. All the results mentioned above
indicate that the concurrent infection by HBV and HCV was
associated with a much higher risk of HCC than each infection
alone in China, pointing to a synergism between HBV and HCV in
HCC. We did not find significant differences between the results in
higher and lower incidence areas, probably owing to the diversity
of risk factors for HCC in China, such as aflatoxin intake, drinking
pond water, eating pickle, etc.
The different mechanisms that have been hypothesised as being
associated with development of HBV- or HCV-related cancer
suggest that both viruses could play an active role at different steps
of the carcinogenic process when they are present together in
hepatocytes. Most evidence suggests that HBV is capable of
initiating the neoplastic process, while HCV could act as a
promoter, and that they may be synergistic in causing HCC
(Donato et al, 1998).
As meta-analyses are based on published studies, bias and
confounding factors may be present (Egger and Smith, 1998). The
interaction of other risk factors with HBV and HCV infections was
not studied in this analysis. Bias and potential confounding factors
may not be well controlled due to the limited details in the
literature, and may therefore slightly affect the results. For more
accurate results, further studies are required.
