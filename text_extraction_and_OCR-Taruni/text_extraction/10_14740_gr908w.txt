Abstract
Background: Continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF￾LVAD) patients have a high prevalence of gastrointestinal bleeding 
from the small bowel. Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is often used 
for diagnosis in these patients, but efficacy has yet to be determined. 
In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of VCE in the management of 
CF-LVAD patients with suspected small bowel bleeding by compar￾ing to a non-VCE CF-LVAD control group.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients with 
CF-LVADs implanted at Stanford Hospital from January 2010 to Oc￾tober 2015. Patients were included in the study if there was a clinical 
suspicion of small bowel bleeding and either a negative upper endos￾copy or colonoscopy.
Results: A total of 26 patients met inclusion criteria for a total of 15 
encounters where VCE was done, and 25 where VCE was not done. 
There were no statistical differences when comparing these groups 
in terms of medical therapy use (thalidomide or octreotide), enter￾oscopy use (double-balloon or push), intervention on lesions, or any 
30-day outcomes. There was no advantage to VCE with regard to the 
composite endpoint time to re-bleed or death related to re-bleeding 
(median 114 vs. 161 days, P = 0.15) after removing patients who did 
not get a VCE due to death or critical illness.
Conclusions: We did not find VCE changed management or out￾comes in CF-LVAD patients with suspected small bowel bleeding 
at our institution when compared to a non-VCE control group. Our 
experience is small and single center, and larger, multi-center studies 
could further elucidate the utility of VCE in this patient population.

Introduction
Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding occurs in 18-40% of patients 
with continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF￾LVAD) or around 0.17 bleeds/patient-year [1]. Potential causes 
of GI bleeding in this population include anti-coagulant use [2, 
3], acquired von Willebrand syndrome from shear stress [4-6], 
and arteriovenous malformations possibly caused by reduced 
pulse pressure and hypoperfusion [3].
Prior case series have found that the source of GI bleed￾ing in CF-LVAD patients is most commonly the upper GI 
tract (48%), followed by the lower GI tract (22%), then small 
bowel (15%), with 22% of unknown location. Most GI bleed￾ing is from arteriovenous malformations (29%), followed by 
gastritis (22%), ulcer (13%), diverticular (6%), with 22% of 
unknown etiology [7].
The current treatment for suspected small bowel bleeding 
is similar to non-LVAD patients [8]. It is recommended that 
patients first undergo an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, 
with consideration for a second look endoscopy. If negative, 
one possible next step is video capsule endoscopy (VCE) [9]. 
However, the efficacy of VCE in CF-LVAD patients is not well 
established.
The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the abil￾ity of capsule endoscopy to improve outcomes including re￾duction of recurrent bleeding in patients with CF-LVADs and 
suspected small bowel bleeding. We retrospectively compared 
a cohort of CF-LVAD patients who had VCE to a similar co￾hort that did not undergo VCE.

tween January 2010 and October 2015 and had a procedure 
performed for GI bleeding. GI bleeding was defined as me￾lena, hematochezia, hematemesis, and/or heme occult positive 
stool with a drop in hemoglobin. All patients were admitted 
to the hospital for the workup of their GI bleeding. Patients 
were included in our study if they had a clinical suspicion for 
small bowel GI bleeding, and either an esophagogastroduo￾denoscopy (EGD) and/or colonoscopy with no clear source of 
bleeding. The study protocol was reviewed and approved for 
human subject research by the Stanford University Institution￾al Review Board.
Data collection
Patient electronic charts were reviewed retrospectively, and 
baseline data prior to endoscopy, details regarding endoscopy, 
outcomes, and follow-up were collected. Data were grouped 
by individual episodes of GI bleeding, with some patients hav￾ing multiple encounters for GI bleeding. These encounters 
were then divided into two groups: those in which VCE was 
performed, and those in which it was not performed.
Procedures
All VCE was performed with a PillCam® device (Given® Im￾aging) and read by a trained gastroenterologist. Prior to VCE 
all patients received at least 2 L of Golytely® for bowel prepa￾ration. Interference, image quality, prep quality, complications 
from capsule endoscopy, and last location in the GI tract were 
recorded if available. For all endoscopy, findings were docu￾mented, including type of lesion, location, source of bleeding, 
and intervention. The way in which VCE affected future man￾agement including enteroscopy, radiologic imaging, interven￾tional radiology, and use of thalidomide and octreotide was 
also recorded.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was time to re-bleeding or 
death related to GI bleeding. Data were censored at the time 
of transplant, unrelated death, or last contact in the chart. Ad￾ditionally, several short-term (30 day) outcomes were assessed 
including re-bleeding, death, re-admission, length of stay, and 
units of red cells transfused after the first procedure. Other 
30-day adverse events including deep vein thrombosis, pul￾monary embolism, suspected or confirmed pump thrombus, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, and death were also recorded. 
Due to rarity, these events were analyzed together under the 
category “total adverse events.”
Data analysis
All binary data were compared using Fisher’s exact test and 
displayed as percentages. For binary data 95% confidence 
intervals were calculated using the binomial distribution. All 
non-parametric data were compared using the Wilcoxon rank 
sum test and displayed as medians with interquartile ranges 
(IQR) where appropriate. All parametric data were compared 
using a two-sample t-test and displayed as means. Categorical 
data were compared using the Chi-square test of significance. 
Analysis of our primary outcome, time to death or re-bleed, 
was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log￾rank test of significance. All statistical analysis was conducted 
using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP).
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 184 CF-LVAD patients were screened and of these 
38 patients (20.7%) had a GI bleed for which endoscopy was 
performed. Of these 38 patients, 26 met the inclusion criteria 
for our study with a total of 40 encounters for GI bleeding (Fig. 
1). There were 15 encounters in which VCE was performed 
and 25 in which VCE was not performed.
In comparing baseline characteristics (Table 1), the big￾gest difference noted was that the VCE group was more likely 
to have undergone both an EGD and colonoscopy (86.6 vs. 
36.0%, P = 0.003, Fisher’s exact test). The reasons patients 
did not undergo colonoscopy in the VCE group include a low 
clinical suspicion for lower GI bleed (n = 1, 6.7%) and a prior 
negative colonoscopy (n = 1, 6.7%). The reasons patients did 
not undergo colonoscopy in the non-VCE group include low 
clinical suspicion for lower GI bleed (n = 8, 32%), a prior neg￾ative colonoscopy (n = 4, 16%), and death/critical illness (n = 
4, 16%). The VCE group also had higher serum platelet levels, 
though both groups had values that were within normal lim￾its. The non-VCE group demonstrated a trend towards greater 
need for mechanical ventilation pre-endoscopy, and a trend to 
greater aspirin use prior to endoscopy. The remainder of the 
baseline characteristics showed no statistical differences.
Management
In the 25 encounters in which VCE was not used, the most 
common reason cited was the belief that VCE would not 
change management (n = 8, 32%) (Fig. 1). Other common 
reasons included critical illness or death (n = 6, 24%), cessa￾tion of bleeding (n = 4, 16%), or performance of either push 
enteroscopy or double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) instead (n = 
4, 16%). In the 15 encounters in which VCE was used, it was 
because there was either no source of bleeding seen on endos￾copy, or lesions were discovered by endoscopy but felt not to 
be the source of bleeding.
VCE was helpful in localizing the source of bleeding in 
five additional cases (33%) where bleeding was not identi￾fied on endoscopy, and was also helpful in diagnosing other 
lesions not seen on endoscopy (Fig. 1). A new diagnosis of 
arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) was never made by VCE 
in our cohort, as such lesions were always seen on preceding

endoscopy.
A positive VCE was more likely to lead to additional endos￾copy. In the five cases where a bleeding source was discovered 
by VCE, three DBEs, one push enteroscopy, and one angiogra￾phy were performed afterwards, and additional argon plasma 
coagulation (APC) was performed in two cases, and endoclip￾ping in one case (Fig. 1). There was only one instance when an 
actively bleeding lesion was intervened upon. In the 10 cases 
when a bleeding source was not discovered by VCE, only one 
DBE was performed without endoscopic intervention (Fig. 1). 
A VCE positive for bleeding however did not influence medi￾cal management (treatment with thalidomide or octreotide). In 
patients with a positive VCE medical treatments were initiated 
in 60% of cases, compared to 50% with a negative VCE.
The VCE and non-VCE cohort overall were managed in 
similar ways (Table 2). There were no differences in endoscop￾ic intervention, performance of push enteroscopy and DBE, or 
initiation of medical treatment with thalidomide or octreotide 
(Table 2).
Outcomes
Time to re-bleed or death related to GI bleed, our primary out￾come, was longer in the group that received VCE (median 114 
days (IQR 57 - 587)) compared to the group that did not (me￾dian 106 days (IQR 10 - 232)) (P = 0.03 log-rank test) (Fig. 2). 
Our sample size was not large enough to adjust our analysis for 
baseline characteristics. After excluding the patients who did 
not receive a capsule endoscopy because of death or critical ill￾ness, there was no difference between the VCE and non-VCE 
groups (median 114 (IQR 57 - 587) vs. 161 (IQR 16 - 328), P 
= 0.15, log-rank test).
There were no statistical differences in 30-day outcomes 
between the VCE and non-VCE groups (Table 3). There was 
a trend towards higher readmissions in the VCE group, and 
a trend towards higher total adverse events in the non-VCE 
group. There were no deaths in the VCE group at 30 days, 
while the death rate was 20% in the non-VCE group (only 
12% related to GI bleeding), but these differences were not 
statically significant. In a subgroup analysis removing deaths 
within 30 days, there were still no significant differences seen 
in 30-day outcomes.
There were no complications associated with VCE itself, 
including no episodes of capsule retention. There were no is￾sues reported with signal capture or interference. Prep quality 
was rated as excellent in 13.3% of capsules, good in 6.7%, 
fair in 13.3%, poor in 33.3%, and was not rated in 33.3% of 
capsules. The capsule was last noted in the stomach in 6.67% 
of cases, the small intestine in 26.7%, the colon in 53.3%, and 
location was not recorded in 13.3% of cases.
Discussion
Our study is the first to compare the use of VCE in CF-LVAD 
patients to a control group that did not undergo VCE. This is a 
valuable comparison because the utility of VCE has not been

definitively established in this patient population. However, 
it is generally accepted as a part of the workup in suspected 
small bowel bleeding based on extrapolation from other pa￾tients groups [9, 10].
Our study demonstrated that VCE was helpful in making 
new diagnoses of GI bleeding not visible on prior endoscop￾ic workup. The diagnostic yield for identifying the source of 
bleeding was 33.3%, which was similar to other studies that re￾port yields of 31-40% [11, 12]. VCE was also helpful in guid￾ing recommendations for further procedures such as DBE en￾teroscopy (Fig. 1), which is a finding similar to another study 
involving CF-LVAD patients [12]. A large study in non-VAD 
patients demonstrated the importance of capsule endoscopy 
guidance for subsequent DBE, with lesions found during the 
first 60% of the capsule study better suited for upper DBE, and 
lesions during the last 40% better suited for lower DBE [13]. 
Additionally, we found capsule endoscopy to be safe in LVAD 
patients, with no complications related to VCE, no capsule re￾tention, and no device interference, which is consistent with 
prior studies [12, 14, 15].
However, in examining our data more closely, only one 
additional intervention on an actively bleeding lesion was 
performed as a result of 15 total VCEs (6.7%). Additionally, 
VCE never resulted in a new diagnosis of AVMs, so thus may

not be particularly helpful when deciding if medical treatment 
with octreotide or thalidomide is needed. When comparing the 
group that got VCE to the control group that did not, we found 
there were no statistical differences in management (Table 2).
When evaluating our primary endpoint, time to re-bleed 
or death related to GI bleeding, the group that received VCE 
fared better. However, the baseline characteristics trended to￾wards the VCE group being healthier, and in 6/25 cases the 
non-VCE group did not get a capsule because of either death or 
critical illness. After excluding these six cases from our analy￾sis, there was no longer a significant difference between the 
VCE and non-VCE groups (Table 3).
Our outcomes are similar to a recent retrospective study 
evaluating 30 patients undergoing VCE. They found no dif￾ferences in patients with positive vs. negative VCEs in terms 
of re-bleeding or mortality, and no difference in bleeding rates 
among those who had endoscopy after VCE vs. those who did 
not [12]. Another study evaluated a total of nine encounters 
for GI bleeding using capsule endoscopy. They found bleeding 
cessation after 100% of studies, but it seems unlikely that cap￾sule endoscopy led to this outcome in many cases [14]. Neither 
of these studies had a control group that did not receive VCE 
for comparison.
If the findings of our study are supported by future studies, 
there may be reason to proceed directly to either upper or lower 
DBE, or trial empiric pharmacotherapy in patients with known 
AVMs [16] depending on the clinical situation. In LVAD pa￾tients, both thalidomide and octreotide have efficacy in treat￾ment of arteriovenous malformations, which are thought to be 
the etiology of the majority of small bowel bleeds [16, 17].
Doing DBE first potentially allows faster intervention on 
bleeding lesions. In one retrospective study of suspected small 
bowel bleeding in VAD patients, enteroscopy done within 24 
h of presentation resulted in faster resolution of GI bleeding, 
fewer units of blood, and less procedures [18]. In another study 
involving obscure bleeding in non-LVAD patients, urgent DBE 
had suprior yield, and resulted in more intervention on target 
lesions compared to urgent capsule endoscopy [19]. A 2007 
meta-analysis suggested that complete upper and lower DBE 
had better diagnostic utility than capsule endoscopy alone 
[20]. DBE, when performed first, may also be more cost effec￾tive [21]. However, a 2013 meta-analysis suggested that cap￾sule endoscopy was better overall for detection of occult GI 
bleeding, and argued for a complementary role, with the two 
studies detecting different lesions [22]. If DBE is going to be 
done before capsule endoscopy in LVAD patients, upper DBE 
is likely to be of higher yeild based on prior studies which have 
shown that all bleeding small bowel lesions in VAD patients 
were found in either the duodenum or jejunum [7]. Although 
it is hard to localize lesions precisely on capsule endoscopy, 
most of the lesions in our study were proximal and better ac￾cessed by upper DBE.
In conclusion, our institutional experience does not sup￾port the routine use of VCE in CF-LVAD patients with sus￾pected small bowel bleeding. Consideration may instead be 
given to empiric treatment with thalidomide or octreotide in 
patients with known AVMs, or early use of DBE.
The limitations of this study include its retrospective de￾sign, small sample size, and non-randomized data. The sample 
size was too small to make meaningful corrections for differ￾ences in baseline characteristics. Future studies are needed 
with larger sample sizes and multicenter data.
