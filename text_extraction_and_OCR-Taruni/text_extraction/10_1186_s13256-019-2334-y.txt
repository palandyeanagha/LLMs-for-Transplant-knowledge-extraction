Abstract
Background: Thrombotic microangiopathy is a pathological condition comprised of microvascular thrombosis
involving any organ of the body leading to thrombocytopenia, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, and end-organ
damage. The most common forms of thrombotic microangiopathies are Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli￾mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and atypical hemolytic uremic
syndrome. The atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome occurs due to genetic and acquired mutations in complement
regulatory factors and to complement activation factors in the immune system, mainly the alternative pathway.
Clinical manifestations and outcomes differ with the prevalent mutations of the patient. Currently, available
treatment modalities are therapeutic plasma exchange and a monoclonal antibody against C5, eculizumab. We
report a case of a Sri Lankan girl diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome complicated with septicemia,
hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, pulmonary hemorrhage with respiratory failure, and hypertension who had a
complete remission following long-term (30 months) therapeutic plasma exchange.
Case presentation: A 15-year-old Sri Lankan girl was transferred from a local hospital with the features of
septicemia and acute kidney injury for specialized management. She had high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg) on
admission. She underwent appendicectomy based on suspicion of acute appendicitis as the cause of sepsis.
Following surgery, her condition deteriorated, and intensive care unit management was warranted because she
developed pulmonary hemorrhages and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and renal replacement
therapy in the form of hemodialysis. Her blood investigations showed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and reduced human complement C3 levels, together with a
normal coagulation profile. She was diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and was initiated on
therapeutic plasma exchange and other supportive therapy, including corticosteroids. Following a lengthy course of
plasma exchange, complete recovery was achieved.
Conclusion: The atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease entity requiring a high index of suspicion to
diagnose. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. Early diagnosis with prompt treatment will render a better outcome. The
atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome needs to be considered in all patients with thrombotic microangiopathy.

Background
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is characterized by
thrombocytopenia and Coombs test-negative hemolytic
anemia with end-organ damage. Any organ of the body
can be involved, commonly the kidney, central nervous
system, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and heart [1]. TMA
is a pathological condition resulting in thrombosis of ca￾pillaries and arterioles. It is due to endothelial injury that
leads to the activation of platelets causing platelet aggre￾gation and thrombus formation. Due to the consump￾tion of platelets, thrombocytopenia ensues. Small vessel
occlusion leads to organ hypoxia and ischemic organ
damage [1, 2]. According to recent updates, TMA is
classified into three major categories. These include
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP), and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
(aHUS), which is further classified according to the eti￾ology. Etiology-based nomenclature, such as pregnancy￾induced aHUS, post-transplant aHUS, drug-induced,
infection-induced aHUS, and autoimmune disease￾associated aHUS, is also widely used currently [3].
Even though the clinical manifestations of TMA are simi￾lar, pathophysiologies differ from each other. TTP occurs
due to severe deficiency of ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin and
metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, mem￾ber 13). ADAMTS-13 is a specific cleaving protease of von
Willebrand factor (vWF). Absent cleavage of ultralarge vWF
multimers due to lack of ADAMTS-13 activity will promote
thrombus formation in small vessels [4, 5]. In STEC-HUS,
Shiga toxin exerts direct toxicity to cells by binding to the
globotriaosylceramide receptors on the target cell surface
and escorting to cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity includes protein
synthesis and apoptosis. Shiga toxin also increases the secre￾tion of abnormally sized vWF multimers from endothelial
cells [4, 6]. aHUS is due to the uncontrolled complement ac￾tivation [7]. We report a case of a Sri Lankan patient diag￾nosed with aHUS who was treated successfully with plasma
exchange therapy. To our knowledge, there is only a handful
of case reports on aHUS in Sri Lanka, and this is the only re￾ported case with complete recovery following a lengthy
course of plasma exchange in Sri Lanka.
Case presentation
A 15-year-old, previously healthy Sri Lankan girl with no
significant medical history or family history of hyperten￾sion or diabetes mellitus was admitted to a peripheral hos￾pital with fever and skin rash of 2 weeks’ duration that
was treated as chickenpox. The diagnosis of chickenpox
was confirmed by a dermatologist. She developed severe
lower abdominal pain. She was oliguric and tachycardic
(pulse rate of 102 beats per minute), and her blood pres￾sure was elevated to 180/100 mm Hg. Her temperature
was 38.1 °C. The result of her neurological examination
was normal. Her serum creatinine was 210 μmol/L (normal
range 80–130 μmol/L), and she had active urinary sedi￾ments (urine full report, red cells 100–150 with 50%
dysmorphic red cells). She was clinically diagnosed with
acute appendicitis, confirmed with ultrasound findings and
complicated with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. She
was initiated on intravenous cefuroxime 750 mg 8-hourly
and intravenous metronidazole 500 mg 8-hourly and was
transferred to the nephrology unit of Teaching Hospital
Kandy for specialized care.
She was referred to the surgical unit, where an append￾ectomy was performed while she was under general
anesthesia. Her appendix was inflamed, but it was not per￾forated. Both intravenous cefuroxime 750 mg 8-hourly
and intravenous metronidazole 500 mg 8-hourly were
continued. In preoperative assessment, her blood pressure
was 150/94 mmHg, and her serum creatinine level was
high (226 μmol/L) with hyperkalemia (5.8 mmol/L), which
was corrected with a potassium-lowering regimen prior to
induction of anesthesia. During the surgery, her blood
pressure was under control, and her recovery was also un￾eventful. Later, the diagnosis of appendicitis was con￾firmed with the histological findings.
On postsurgery day 1, she was anuric and severely
acidotic, and her creatinine level further inclined. Urgent
hemodialysis was offered, and input-output was strictly
monitored. A renal biopsy was performed.
On postsurgery day 3, she developed high-grade fever
again, and therefore surgical site infection or femoral
vascular catheter infection was suspected. Intravenous
antibiotics were changed; intravenous flucloxacillin 500
mg 6-hourly was added according to the microbiology
team’s opinion. The vascular catheter was removed, and
catheter tip and blood samples, which were taken with
aseptic nontouch technique, were sent for cultures. The
culture results were negative for aerobic and anaerobic
bacteria and fungi, and surgical site infection was also
excluded. Findings of an echocardiogram ruled out in￾fective endocarditis.
The patient’s full blood count showed hemoglobin of
7.6 g/dl, platelet count of 68 × 109
/L, and white cell
count of 19.5 × 109
/L. Blood film revealed features of mi￾croangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The patient’s serum
creatinine was 312 μmol/L. Her liver enzymes were
within the normal range. Her coagulation profile was
normal, including the thromboelastogram. Her lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 3124 U/L. Her reticulo￾cyte count was 7.27%. Her D-dimer was negative at 0.78
mg/L (< 1). Her Coombs test result was negative. With
the blood film evidence and other test result findings, to￾gether with unexplained fever, TTP was suspected. She
was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was
initiated on therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) together
with cryo-poor plasma as the replacement fluid.
Basnayake et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports (2020) 14:11 Page 2 of 5

Her ICU stay was complicated with pulmonary
hemorrhage with lower respiratory tract infection followed
by respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation,
and intravenous antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem
1 g 12-hourly and levofloxacin 500 mg once per day. Ini￾tially, plasma exchange was carried out daily (for 14 days)
and then every other day (for 28 days). She was offered
hemodialysis every other day for 14 days, every third day
for 21 days, and every fourth day for 24 days. Hemodialysis
was stopped following the improvement of urine output.
Histological examination of renal biopsy revealed fibrin￾oid necrosis of small arteries. The patient’s complement
C3 was 57.6 mg/dl (normal range 90–180), and her com￾plement C4 was 17.4 mg/dl (10–40). Results of tests for
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear anti￾body, and double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
were negative. Test results for hepatitis B surface antigen,
hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus, and
VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) were nega￾tive. Blood culture results were negative for E. coli. Investi￾gation findings together with hypertension, blood picture
features of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, kidney in￾jury, and pulmonary hemorrhage associated with respira￾tory failure prompted the diagnosis of atypical hemolytic
uremic syndrome. ADAMTS-13 level and genetic studies
were not done, owing to the unavailability of resources.
As the long-term management plan, the patient was
offered long-term plasma exchange in a tapering regi￾men. Initially, two cycles per week were arranged. She
gradually responded to treatment, and investigation re￾sults were improving. She stayed in the ICU for 14 days
and was discharged from the hospital after a total of 69
days with two antihypertensive agents and a tapering
regimen of oral prednisolone.
She was regularly followed up in the nephrology clinic,
and TPE was offered once per week for 6 months and
then tapered to once in 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8
weeks. Following a total TPE course of 30 months,
plasma exchange therapy was omitted. Her hemoglobin,
platelet count, serum creatinine, LDH, reticulocyte
count, and blood film were all within normal ranges.
Discussion
Our patient represents a typical case of aHUS with a se￾vere form of this disease. She developed a number of
complications, such as septicemia, refractory hyperten￾sion, and pulmonary hemorrhage with respiratory fail￾ure. She was also in an oligoanuric state for almost 2
months. This case proves that early diagnosis and
prompt treatment with TPE and renal replacement ther￾apy will lead to a complete recovery from aHUS.
aHUS occurs due to complement-related abnormal￾ities. The complement system is a part of the immune
system that destroys microorganisms and damaged cells
by enhancing the ability of antibodies and phagocytic
cells via complement activation. It also promotes inflam￾mation and attacks the pathogen’s cell membrane. It is
activated via three pathways: the classical pathway, the
alternative pathway (AP), and the lectin pathway. Un￾controlled activation of complements in AP is strongly
associated with aHUS [4, 8, 9].
AP is continuously activated at a low level due to spon￾taneous C3 hydrolysis because it does not need specific
initiators. C3 internal thioester bond is hydrolyzed by
H2O easily and forms C3(H2O). Then it interacts with
complement factor B (CFB) followed by cleavage by com￾plement factor D (CFD) and generates C3(H2O)Bb. For
the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b by C3 convertase en￾zyme complex, the C3(H2O)Bb molecule works as an ini￾tiator. However, complement factor I (CFI), complement
factor H (CFH), and membrane cofactor protein (MCP)
rapidly inactivate C3b. C3b may bind with CFB to form
C3bB. This complex then is cleaved by CFD into Ba and
Bb. Bb remains bound to C3b to produce C3bBb, which is
the C3 convertase in AP. C3 convertase may recruit an￾other C3b and produce C3bBbC3b, which is the C5 con￾vertase. C5 convertase cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b
molecules. The C5b molecule then binds to C6, C7, C8,
and C9 to generate the membrane attack complex (MAC).
MAC destroys the target directly by the formation of
membrane pores [4, 10, 11].
Abnormalities of complement activation factors, such
as CFB and CFD, and complement regulatory factors,
such as CFI, CFH, and MCP, are associated with the de￾velopment of aHUS. These abnormalities are due to un￾controlled complement activation by the loss-of￾function variants in complement-regulatory proteins or
gain-of-function variants in complement activation fac￾tors [4, 12]. Multiple genetic and acquired complement
abnormalities have been identified.
CFH abnormalities have the highest frequency, account￾ing for 20–30% of cases. The main effects are impaired
CFH binding to C3b and/or glycosaminoglycans on host
cell surface and decreased cofactor activity [13–15]. Ef￾fects of CFI abnormalities are impaired CFI secretion and
reduced proteolytic activity. MCP abnormalities have a
frequency of 8–10% with reduction in MCP expression
and decreased C3b binding and cofactor activity [16, 17].
Anti-CFH antibody inhibits the complement-regulatory
function of CFH [10, 18].
C3 defects result in resistance to CFI-mediated inactiva￾tion of C3b and also generation of hyperactive C3 conver￾tase [19]. Abnormalities in CFB lead to the resistance of
convertase to decay by CFH and formation of hyperactive
C3 convertase [20]. Several coagulation-related factor ab￾normalities are also recognized; thrombomodulin, diacyl￾glycerol kinase epsilon, and plasminogen abnormalities
are related to the development of aHUS [10, 21–23].

Clinical manifestations and outcome differ with under￾lying genetic or acquired defects in the complement sys￾tem. Patients with aHUS, who have genetic mutations,
are commonly affected during childhood (67%) [24].
Acute episodes of aHUS present with severe Coombs￾negative hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute
kidney injury. Extrarenal manifestations occur in 20% of
cases [10, 25]. Among patients with CFH, CFI, and C3
mutations, 60–70% will progress to permanent renal
damage or die during the initial episode or progress to
end-stage renal failure (ESRF) following relapses. But in
children with CFH antibodies, only 30% of patients end
up with ESRF [24]. CFB abnormalities are related to
worse renal prognosis, whereas CFH mutations are asso￾ciated with more cardiovascular complications and a
higher mortality [20, 25]. Ten-year survival in patients
with CFH abnormalities is 50%, but patients with CFI or
C3 mutations or anti-CFH antibodies have higher sur￾vival rates of 80–90% at 10 years [24]. The best progno￾sis is seen in patients with MCP mutations because they
have complete remission at a rate of 80–90%. Even
though recurrence is frequent, 80% of patients will not
require hemodialysis [24, 25].
Current therapeutic options for aHUS are plasma ex￾change and eculizumab. Empirically, TPE is considered as
the first-line treatment. It assists in clearing abnormal
complement-related factors such as anti-CFH autoanti￾bodies and provides complement-regulatory factors to the
circulation [26]. Although TPE is associated with a reduc￾tion of mortality from 50% to 25%, in a 3-year follow-up,
48% of pediatric patients and 67% of adult patients died or
progressed to ESRF [15, 26, 27]. TPE combined with im￾munosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids and aza￾thioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and an anti-CD20
antibody (rituximab) has shown long-term dialysis-free
survival in 60–70% of patients [10, 28].
Eculizumab has become the gold standard treatment
for aHUS with a good efficacy and safety profile. It is a
monoclonal antibody against C5. It blocks the cleavage
of C5 to C5a and C5b. C3b binding to C6, C7, C8, and
C9 is prevented, and formation of MAC is blocked [29].
Eculizumab is recommended as the first-line therapy for
children because of their increased risk of developing
catheter-related complications such as infections with
regard to TPE [30]. The duration of treatment with ecu￾lizumab in aHUS is unknown. Original approval was for
lifelong treatment, whereas emerging evidence suggests
that aHUS may not require indefinite eculizumab treat￾ment and cessation may help mitigate sequelae of ther￾apy [31]. However, when eculizumab is unavailable in
resource-poor settings such as Sri Lanka, TPE may be
the first treatment of choice. In our patient, TPE was a
successful treatment, because she completely recovered
following long-term therapy.
Conclusion
Diagnosing aHUS is a challenge for a variety of reasons.
It is a rare disease entity; complement diagnostics are
not reliable; 30–50% of patients do not have genetic or
acquired mutations in the complement system; TMA
occur in the context of complement-activating condi￾tions; no specific test is available to confirm the diagno￾sis of aHUS; and aHUS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Early
diagnosis and therapy improves outcome. aHUS should
be considered in all patients with TMA.
