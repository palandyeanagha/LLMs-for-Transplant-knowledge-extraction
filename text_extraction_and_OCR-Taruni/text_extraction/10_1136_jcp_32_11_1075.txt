Cytological diagnosis of virus-infected cells in
Papanicolaou smears and its application in clinical
practice
D. V. COLEMAN
From the Department ofPathology, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London W2 INY, UK
SUMMARY The cytopathic changes of herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, the human
polyomaviruses, and the trachoma agent can be recognised in smears prepared from a wide variety of
specimens. The morphology of virus-infected cells is described, and the clinical value of these
observations is discussed. Cytological diagnosis offers a rapid and convenient method of detecting
infection with these viruses which can be confirmed by conventional virological method while the
patient is still in the acute stages of the disease. Confirmation can also be made retrospectively by
reprocessing cells, identified in the Papanicolaou smear, for electron microscopy. Screening for
virus-infected cells in cytological smears is a technique that can be developed in any pathology
laboratory prepared to provide a comprehensive cytology service, and it is proving to be a useful
tool in clinical diagnosis and applied research.
In recent years, cytopathologists have observed that
the alterations in cell morphology that accompany
certain virus infections can be recognised in
Papanicolaou smears submitted to routine exam￾ination by light microscopy. The cytopathic changes
due to herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus,
cytomegalovirus, and the human polyomaviruses
have been described in epithelial cells in cytological
specimens such as cervical smears, urine, sputum,
and conjunctival scrapes, and the presence of virus￾infected cells in the smears has been shown to be a
convenient and reliable guide to active infection of
the patient with these viruses. These observations
have widened the scope of the cytodiagnostic
technique for they imply that the large numbers of
cytological specimens that are submitted routinely
for examination for malignant cells can at the same
time be screened for evidence of viral activity.
The aim of this paper is to describe the morphology
of virus-infected cells in Papanicolaou-stained smears
and to discuss the value of these observations in
clinical practice. The identification of cytological
markers of virus disease can alert the clinician to
viral illness in his patient when none is suspected and
can provide him with a differential diagnosis when

the services of a virology laboratory are not im￾mediately to hand. Moreover, cytology can provide a
rapid method of screening for viruses that are not
readily isolated.
Throughout this paper emphasis is placed on the
fact that cytological manifestations of viral activity
provide presumptive evidence only of active infection
with a specific virus or group of viruses. Whenever
possible the cytodiagnosis should be confirmed by
conventional virological methods while the patient is
still in the acute stages of the disease. As this is not
always possible, an alternative method of confirming
the cytodiagnosis is discussed in this paper. This
involves the reprocessing of selected cells in the
Papanicolaou smear for electron microscopy and is
described more fully in the section on the human
polyomaviruses.
Cytodiagnosis of genital herpes in the female patient
The cytological diagnosis of genital herpes depends
upon the recognition of multinucleate giant
squamous cells in Papanicolaou-stained smears
(Figs 1 to 3). These cells were first described in
cervical smears by Stern and Longo (1963), who
realised their potential value as markers of viral
infection. Infection with herpes simplex virus is
characterised by cell fusion with the formation of

These are easy to locate during routine screening
with low-power microscope objectives and may
contain up to 30 nuclei in tight aggregates. Each
nucleus has a clearly defined outline as a result of the
heavy deposition of chromatin beneath the nuclear
membrane, and the nuclear shape appears moulded
by adjacent nuclei. Nuclei may contain a large,
centrally placed acidophilic inclusion surrounded by
a clear halo (Fig. 3); but not infrequently the nuclei
are devoid of inclusion bodies and present an empty,
ballooned, 'ground-glass' appearance, the substance
of which takes up an amphophilic stain (Figs 1 and 2).
It is important to remember that the absence of
inclusion bodies does not invalidate the diagnosis.
The presence of inclusion bodies merely represents
an advanced stage of the disease and is not, as some
authors suggest, evidence of recurrent infection. The
smears may contain many polymorphs if ulceration
is present, and Trichomonas vaginalis and monilia
may also be identified. Many single squamous and
columnar cells may show evidence of virus infection
with ballooning of the nucleus, but these are not a

reliable index of viral infection and provide support￾ive evidence only.
The accuracy of the cytological method has been
subject to careful review after reports of serious
diagnostic errors whereby herpes-infected cells in
cervical smears have been interpreted as malignant,
resulting in unnecessary surgical intervention (Naib
et al., 1966; An, 1969). In an attempt to ascertain the
accuracy of a cytodiagnosis of herpes genitalis,
Morse and her colleagues (1974) investigated 186
women attending a venereal diseases clinic for
evidence of herpes simplex infection of the genital
tract. Cervical smears and swabs for virus isolation
were obtained at each clinic attendance, and the
results were correlated with the clinical findings.
Multinucleate giant cells were noted in cervical
smears from eight patients, and herpes genitalis was
confirmed by virus isolation and/or clinical evidence
of infection in seven of the eight cases. Herpes
simplex virus type 2 was isolated from the cervices of
a further eight patients, none of whom had clinical
evidence of genital viral infection or cytological
atypia. These observations indicate that cervical
screening is an effective way of detecting herpes
simplex infection in half the women who are
shedding virus. Cytology is a particularly useful
method of detecting clinically inapparent infection.
We have observed in these cases that multinucleate
giant cells form in the cervical epithelium without
vesicle formation (Fig. 4).
Although genital herpes is a self-limiting disease
and clinical evidence of infection may be inapparent
to patient and physician alike, a cytodiagnosis of
herpes simplex virus infection of the uterine cervix
carries with it a clinical significance which is defined
in the following paragraphs.
1 The prevalence of genital herpes among women
has been estimated from combined cytological and
virological studies of women attending a venereal
diseases clinic and gynaecological clinics (Morse
et al., 1974). Evidence of genital herpes infection
was found in 8-6 % of women attending the venereal
diseases clinic and in less than 1 % of women
attending the gynaecological outpatient clinic.
2 A high incidence of gonorrhoea has been observed
among women with genital herpes, and in every case
of herpes simplex infection an attempt should be
made to demonstrate the gonococcus (Beilby et al.,
1968; Morse et al., 1974). While bacteriological
investigation for gonorrhoea is routine for patients
attending venereal diseases clinics, it is not a test
that is usually included in the examination of
women attending gynaecological clinics, well women
clinics, or family planning clinics. The cytologist
should indicate to the clinician the need for this
additional investigation whenever a cytological

diagnosis of genital herpes is made in patients in
whom venereal disease is not suspected.
3 Herpetic lesions of the uterine cervix can be
confused clinically with cancer, and a cytological
smear can assist in the differential diagnosis. The
necrotising cervicitis of herpes may mimic a necrotic
carcinoma (Willcox, 1968), and in pregnancy
cervical herpes may even masquerade as a large,
fungating tumour of the cervix. Stein and Siciliano
(1966) described how surgical biopsy was inadequate
in such a case as only necrotic tissue was seen in
histological section. The multinucleate giant cells of
herpes simplex were evident in the cervical smear,
and the diagnosis was confirmed by virus isolation.
The lesion resolved after a period of six weeks. Of
course, carcinoma and genital herpes may occur
together, with clear cytological evidence of both
lesions in the Papanicolaou smear (see legend to
Fig. 4).

the fact that, of 245 women whose cervical smears
contained the multinucleate giant cell typical of
genital herpes infection, 58 were found to have
coexisting neoplastic changes in the cervical
epithelium. This observation can be interpreted in a
number of different ways. It is possible that herpes
simplex type 2 and cervical neoplasia are indepen￾dently related to promiscuity. Alternatively, the
herpes simplex virus may grow preferentially in
neoplastic epithelium. Finally, herpes simplex virus
type 2 may itself be a cervical carcinogen.
Naib's observation provided a stimulus to
research into the relationship between genital

infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 and
cervical cancer. Most investigations have taken the
form of comparisons of the prevalence of neutralising
antibody against herpes simplex virus type 2 in
women with cervical cancer and in women without
malignant disease matched for age, marital status,
religion, and social class (Rawls etal., 1969; Nahmias
et al., 1970; Royston and Aurelian, 1970). It was
shown with some consistency that the prevalence of
herpes simplex virus type 2 antibody was higher
among women with cervical cancer than among
controls. However, because herpes simplex virus
type 1 and herpes simplex virus type 2 share common

antigens, the interpretation of the amount of
neutralising antibody in any particular serum may be
misleading when applied to any individual patient,
as was done in many of the studies. It is significant,
however, that a study by Skinner and his colleagues
(1971), which has taken into account this problem of
antigenic overlap, confirmed the results of earlier
investigations.
Further studies are needed to determine the
relationship between herpes simplex virus type 2 and
squamous carcinoma of the cervix.With this in mind,
we have embarked on a prospective study of 160
women with cervical dysplasia, which involves
regular cytological, colposcopic, and virological
investigation of the patients at three-monthly
intervals over a period of three years in order to
determine whether recurrent infection with herpes
simplex or other viruses affects the rate of progression
of the dysplasia to carcinoma in situ. It is anticipated
that information from this study will help to clarify
the role of genital herpes in cervical neoplasia.
Cytodiagnosis of cytomegalic inclusion disease
The large, basophilic, intranuclear, 'birds eye' in￾clusions (Figs 5(a), 5(b), and 6), which are a feature of
cytomegalic inclusion disease, were first noted in
histological sections of the liver, lung, and kidneys of
a stillborn infant by Jesionek and Kiolemenoglou in
1904.
Fetterman (1952) was the first to demonstrate that
inclusions can be detected in the urine of neonates
with clinical evidence of the disease. The inclusion￾bearing cells are readily recognised in Papanicolaou￾stained smears of the urine sediment, and the
important diagnostic feature is the presence of a
large, basophilic, intranuclear inclusion body
separated by a clearly defined halo from the thickened
nuclear membrane. The cells are large (25-35 [t in
diameter) and can be readily detected at low mag￾nification. However, they may be few in number, and
careful screening of several urine samples may be
necessary for diagnosis. Medearis (1964) showed that
cytology was a less sensitive method of detecting
cytomegalic inclusion disease than virus isolation
for he was able to demonstrate inclusion-bearing
cells in the urine of only four out of seven infants who
were excreting cytomegalovirus. Nevertheless, it
should be borne in mind that isolation of cyto￾megalovirus in monolayer culture is a protracted
procedure taking several weeks to accomplish as the
virus grows slowly. Cytological examination of the
urine sediment can play a useful role in the pre￾liminary investigation of the infant and in establish￾ing a differential diagnosis between neonatal
cytomegalic disease and other congenital diseases
that closely resemble it such as rubella and toxo￾plasmosis. It is our experience, and that of other
cytopathologists, that the result of cytological
investigation can be improved if a membrane

filtration technique is used to trap the cells in the
urine (Naib, 1963; Cederqvist and Johansson, 1967;
Johnston et al., 1969).
The description of inclusion-bearing cells in
infants with cytomegaloviruria prompted several
cytological studies of adult patients who are suscep￾tible to cytomegalovirus infection. Inclusion-bearing
cells were reported in smears of urine sediment from
patients receiving cytotoxic drug therapy for
malignant disease or for the purposes of trans￾plantation (Chang, 1970; Johnston et al., 1969). In
these studies, the presence of inclusions was assumed
to reflect infection with cytomegalovirus. Our own
observations have shown this to be a misconception.
In a combined cytological and virological study of
82 renal allograft recipients, inclusion-bearing cells
were noted in Papanicolaou-stained smears of urinary
sediment in 31 patients (38 %). Ten of the 31 patients
were found to be excreting cytomegalovirus, and
human polyomavirus infection was confirmed in 11
others. A further 10 patients were found to be
excreting both viruses in the urine. Cytomegalovirus
was also isolated from the urine of 16 of the 51
patients in whom inclusion-bearing cells had not
been detected. Our studies indicate that the inclusion￾bearing cells in the urine of immunosuppressed
patients can be regarded as markers of virus infection
of the urinary tract, but in the majority of cases the
cytopathology is due to polyomavirus (Coleman,
unpublished data).
Cytodiosis of human polyomavirus infection of
the urinary tract
In 1971, two new viruses were isolated from human
tissue and designated BK virus and JC virus respect￾ively. BK virus was recovered from the urinary tract
of a renal allograft recipient (Gardner et al., 1971)
and JC virus was isolated from the brain of a patient
with progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy
(Padgett et al., 1971). The viruses were identified as
members of the polyoma subgroup of the papova￾viruses, and serological studies have shown that
infection with these newly identified human polyoma￾viruses is widespread. Initial exposure to these
viruses occurs early in childhood, and primary
infection in most individuals appears to be followed
by a long period of latency. Reactivation of latent
infection has been observed in patients whose
immunity is impaired, and the sites for reactivation
appear to be the urinary tract and brain (Padgett and
Walker, 1976).
We have shown that reactivation of latent
polyomavirus in the urinary tract is frequently
accompanied by the formation of numerous large
inclusion-bearing cells in the surface layers of the
urothelium of the ureter and renal pelvis (Fig. 7)
(Coleman et al., 1973; Coleman, 1975). These cells,
which contain cyanophilic intranuclear inclusions,
are readily exfoliated and may be found in large
numbers in smears of the urine sediment of patients

who are actively excreting the virus (Figs 8 and 9).
The nuclear structure of the polyomavirus-infected
cells in the urine sediment presents a variable
appearance, but two consistent morphological
patterns can be recognised. The cell may present a
classical 'birds eye' appearance and the nucleus
contain a single cyanophilic inclusion separated from
the thickened nuclear membrane by a clear halo
(Fig. 9). Alternatively, the nucleus appears enlarged
and densely cyanophilic but structureless and is
surrounded by the thick nuclear membrane (Fig. 8).
As might be expected, these appearances present
problems of diagnosis. The virus-infected cells may
be confused with abnormal cells shed from a
transitional-cell carcinoma. These tumour cells
often have large hyperchromatic cyanophilic nuclei
and prominent nuclear membranes. The difficulty is
compounded by the fact that both types of cell may
be present in the same specimen. However, careful
scrutiny of the nuclear structure at high magnification
will permit discrimination between virus-infected
cells and cancer cells. The nuclei of the virus￾infected cells appear amorphous and of uniform
shape and size, whereas the nuclei of the cancer cells
present a coarsely granular appearance due to the
presence of chromatin clumps of varying size and
shape unevenly distributed in the nucleus.
The inclusion-bearing cells, which result from
infection with the polyomaviruses, closely resemble
those seen in cytomegalic inclusion disease. It has
been suggested that the two types of cell can be
distinguished in the light microscope by observing
whether inclusion bodies are present in the cytoplasm
as well as in the nucleus. Clusters of small cyanophilic
inclusions may be found in the cytoplasm of cyto￾megalovirus-infected cells. These are not present in
polyomavirus-infected cells. It should be re￾membered, however, that viruses are not the only
cause for cytoplasmic inclusions. Lipid degeneration
in the cytoplasm or phagocytosis of polymorphs
may prove a source of diagnostic error (Melamed
and Wolinska, 1961).
In order to resolve the problems associated with
the confirmation of virus infections suspected on
cytological grounds, we have developed a technique
that involves the reprocessing of inclusion-bearing
cells in the Papanicolaou smear for examination in
the electron microscope (Coleman et al., 1977).
Single cells are picked off the smear and embedded

of the cells permits the visualisation of virus particles
in the cell, and these can be further identified on the
basis of particle size and structure. Using this
technique, we have been able to carry out retro￾spective studies on cytological material when
conventional virological methods have been un￾successful (Figs 5(a), 5(b), 6, 10, 11(a), and 11(b)).
The detection of new cases of active infection with
the human polyomavirus presents a problem for the
virologist and clinician alike. Growth of the viruses
in monolayer culture is slow and difficult, and until
virological techniques are improved, cytology offers
an excellent opportunity to screen selected patients
for evidence of virus excretion (Coleman et al., 1973).
It has been used successfully to identify virus
excretors among renal allograft recipients and
patients receiving cytotoxic therapy for treatment of
malignant disease. A recent cytological and viro￾logical study of 1000 pregnant women has shown
that reactivation of human polyomavirus occurs in

approximately 30. Studies are in progress to
correlate maternal infection with fetal development
and neonatal damage. Observations made by Koss
on routine cytological material led to the detection
of polyomavirus infection in 12 of 3648 specimens of
urine received for malignant cell cytology from
patients with a wide variety of primary disorders,
which included hypertension, rheumatic heart
disease, benign prostatic disease, and tuberculosis
(unpublished data). The immunological competence
of these 12 patients has not been investigated but
the cytological diagnosis has been confirmed using
the electron microscope technique described above.
There are many aspects of infection with the
human polyomavirus that have yet to be explored.
Primary infection has not been identified although it
is known to occur in early childhood. JC virus has
been identified in the oligodendroglial cells in the
brain of patients with progressive multifocal
leucoencephalopathy but infection with this virus
does not appear to be confined to the brain as it has
also been isolated from the urine of pregnant
women. Active infection with BK virus has been
reported in association with ureteric stenosis in renal
allograft recipients but the role of urinary stasis and
urothelial damage in virus reactivation has yet to be
ascertained. These observations indicate that the
potential for research into infection with these new
viruses is wide. By using cytological markers as
evidence of active virus infection, the physiological
changes that predispose to polyomavirus infection
can be further evaluated and the clinical significance
of these new viruses may be ascertained.

masses within the nuclei of the epithelial cells of

intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm. The abnormal cells
may be encountered in Papanicolaou-stained cervical
smears taken from patients with condylomatous
lesions of the cervix or vagina. As the cells derived
from the warts are not readily distinguished from the
dyskaryotic cells shed from premalignant lesions of
the cervix, that is, dysplasia and carcinoma in situ,
problems of differential diagnosis may arise (Naib
and Masukawa, 1961; Purola and Savia, 1977)
(Fig. 12).
It is possible that a number of lesions previously
classified as cervical dysplasia actually represent
condylomatous lesions of the cervix. If this proves to
be the case, it will affect current concepts of the
evolution of intraepithelial and invasive cancer of the
cervix.
Very recently, abnormal epithelial cells, designated
'balloon cells' as they exhibit marked cytoplasmic
vacuolation, have been described in Papanicolaou
smears from the uterine cervix. They are thought
to be derived from areas of koilocytosis or 'warty
atypia' of the cervical epithelium. It has been
suggested by Meisels and Fortin (1976) that koilo￾cytosis represents an early stage of infection with
wart virus before the formation of clinically detect￾able papillomatous lesions. Papillomavirus particles
have been observed in ultrathin sections of cervical
epithelium which in the light microscope showed the
changes characteristic of koilocytosis (Laverty et al.,
1978). These observations have yet to be confirmed.
Diagnosis of oculoviral infection
Acute conjunctivitis may be physical, chemical,
allergic, or infectious in origin, and the clinical
symptoms and signs of these different forms of
conjunctivitis frequently overlap. In clinical practice,
a differential diagnosis may be made on the clinical
evidence and treatment started without waiting for
the results of pathological tests as a week or more
may elapse before these are available. The conse￾quences of misdiagnosis can be serious, especially if
the use of steroids is contemplated as a therapeutic
measure.
In cases where a viral conjunctivitis is suspected,
cytological investigation can provide a rapid method
of confirming the clinical diagnosis before treatment.
The cytological changes associated with infection
due to Chlamydia trachomatis, herpes zoster, and
herpes simplex can be recognised in Giemsa-stained
smears of conjunctival scrapings.
Human ocular infection with C. trachomatis gives
rise to the clinical diseases, panendemic trachoma
and para trachoma (inclusion conjunctivitis). Both
forms of infection are characterised by replication of
the chlamydial agent in the cells of the tarsal
conjunctiva with the formation of characteristic
intracytoplasmic inclusions. In the early stages of
infection, the inclusions are made up of clusters of
microorganisms, I ,u in diameter, enveloped in a
polysaccharide matrix which stains deeply with a
haematoxylin or Giemsa stain. At a later stage the
discrete microorganisms lie in a vacuole in the
cytoplasm of the cell. The vacuole enlarges until it
ruptures or 'bursts', releasing the microorganisms
into the intercellular space from which they infect
the adjacent cells (Figs 13 to 15).
Paratrachoma (or inclusion conjunctivitis) is a
sexually transmitted disease, and the primary sites
for multiplication of the chlamydial agent in this type
of infection are the urethra and uterine cervix. In￾clusion bodies have been described in Papanicolaou￾stained cervical smears, but their recognition is
extremely difficult in view of the frequent con￾tamination of smears with bacteria and cell debris.
Cytology is of limited value in detecting chlamydial
infection of the female genital tract and of the male
urethra. On the other hand, cytology is an effec￾1084

stages of the disease (Dawson and Schachter, 1967;
Darougar et al., 1971).
Alternative methods of diagnosing chlamydial
infection include immunofluorescence and immuno￾peroxidase staining of conjunctival smears. Giemsa
staining has been found to be slightly less sensitive
than the immunocytochemical methods but is
more convenient for clinic use. Moreover, problems
of artifact are minimal with the Giemsa method
(Woodland et al., 1978). Inoculation of monolayer
cultures of irradiated McCoy cells with conjunctival
swabbings provides another method of detecting
C. trachomatis, but facilities for this investigation are
available in only a few specialist laboratories,
thereby emphasing the value of cytology in routine
clinical practice.
The cytological change associated with con￾junctival infection with herpes simplex virus and
herpes zoster is the formation of syncytia of con￾junctival cells. These appear to be larger and more
numerous in varicella/zoster virus infection than
in herpes simplex infection (Fig. 16).
Diagnosis of dermatological diseases
The diagnosis of viral infection of the skin by
cytological methods was first described by Tyzzer
(1905), who perfected the technique by experimenting
on convicts during an epidemic of varicella in a penal

colony in 1906. Although he advocated the cyto￾logical method for 'use at the bedside', there is no
indication that this suggestion was adopted until
Tzanck (1948) compared the cytological appearances
of smears from the lesions of varicella zoster and
herpes simplex, pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis,
and bullous pemphigoid, and recommended that
cytology could usefully be applied to the differential
diagnosis of these conditions.
These dermatological conditions have a clinically
similar presentation, characterised by crops of
vesicles. Their aetiologies, however, are quite
distinct, only herpes simplex and varicella zoster
being due to viruses. In the herpes infections and in
pemphigus, the vesicles form in the epidermal layer
of the skin and hence contain numerous exfoliated
epithelial cells. In dermatitis herpetiformis and
bullous pemnphigoid, the blisters are subepidermal,
and the blister cavity contains an inflammatory
exudate in which eosinophils predominate. Smears

Cytological diagnosis of virus-infected cells in Papanicolaou smears
prepared from vesicle fluid or from scrapings taken
from the base of the vesicles present characteristic
cytological patterns.
The diagnostic cell in vesicles due to herpes
simplex and varicella-zoster infection is the multi￾nucleate giant cell, which in no way differs from
that found in cervical smears (Figs 1 and 2). The
characteristic cells found in the bullae of pemphigus
vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are the acantho￾lytic cells (Fig. 17), which appear in smears as
discrete, rounded cells with large nuclei occupying
two-thirds of the cell. Multiple large nucleoli or
mitotic figures are often seen and are an indication
of cell division occurring in the prickle cell layer.
While virus isolation, direct electron microscopy,
and biopsy are alternative methods for the diagnosis
of these vesicular lesions, cytology offers a quick and
simple method of distinguishing them, especially if
the lesion affects the mucous membrane of the mouth
or vagina. Scrapings obtained from the base of the
vesicles with a scalpel or fine metal dental spatula
often provide a more cellular smear.
Cytological diagnosis of respiratory viral infection
The ciliated tufts of cytoplasm that can occasionally
be seen in abundance in smears of sputum were
first described by Papanicolaou in 1956, who gave
this cytological pattern the name ciliocytophthoria
(CCP) (Fig. 18). He thought that these ciliated
fragments of bronchial epithelium were a precursor
of malignant disease of the bronchus, and it was
only later that their association with acute viral
infection of the upper respiratory tract was noted
(Pierce and Hirsch, 1958). It has been found that
CCP can be detected in the sputum of about half the

patients with acute respiratory virus infection in the
absence of secondary bacterial infection. CCP is a
reflection of the destructive effect of the respiratory
viruses on the bronchial epithelium (Fig. 19).
Occasionally, it occurs after bronchoscopy or
radiotherapy, which can cause rapid destruction of
the bronchial epithelium.
The multinucleate giant cell of herpes simplex may
be seen in sputum samples obtained from patients
with herpetic lesions of the mouth, pharynx, or
tracheal mucosa. Respiratory herpes is particularly
frequent in patients receiving cytoxic drug therapy,
and we have observed that the distinction between
herpes-infected cells and malignant cells in these
patients is not always straightforward. The giant
cells in sputum often have intensely eosinophilic
cytoplasm, which may be drawn out into long
processes, and the distinction between them and
'tadpole' cells from a squamous carcinoma of
bronchus needs to be made with care (Fig. 20). The
diagnostic problem is complicated by the fact that
herpetic lung infection is often associated with an
intense local necrosis, and the sputum contains
abundant necrotic cell debris and blood (Naib
et al., 1968).

scientific officer, Department of Pathology, St
Mary's Hospital Medical School, processed the
cells shown in Figs 5, 6, 10, and 11 for electron
microscopy.
