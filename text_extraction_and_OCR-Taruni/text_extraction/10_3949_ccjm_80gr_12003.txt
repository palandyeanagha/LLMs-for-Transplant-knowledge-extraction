Advanced heart failure:
Transplantation, LVADs, and beyond
■■ ABSTRACT
For patients with advanced heart failure, outcomes are 
good after heart transplantation, but not enough donor 
hearts are available. Fortunately, mechanical circula￾tory assist devices have become an excellent option and 
should be considered either as a bridge to transplanta￾tion or as “destination therapy.” Current mechanical cir￾culatory assist devices improve quality of life in patients 
who are candidates. 
■■ KEY POINTS
After heart transplantation, survival rates are high and 
quality of life is excellent, although coronary artery 
disease, renal dysfunction, and the need for immunosup￾pressive drugs are ongoing challenges.
Changes in donor heart allocation made in 2006 more 
strongly favor the sickest patients and have reduced the 
rate of mortality on the waiting list. 
Continuous-flow left-ventricular assist devices offer many 
advantages over the older pulsatile-flow devices, includ￾ing improved outcomes, smaller size, less noise, and 
greater durability.
Inotropic therapy is purely palliative and should not be 
viewed as an alternative to heart transplantation or 
device implantation.

Patients with advanced heart fail￾ure far outnumber the hearts available 
for transplantation. Partly as a consequence 
of this shortage, left-ventricular assist devices 
(LVADs) are being used more widely. 
This article is an update on options for
managing severe, advanced heart failure, with 
special attention to new developments and 
continuing challenges in heart transplantation 
and LVADs. 
■ THE PREVALENCE OF HEART FAILURE
About 2.6% of the US population age 20 and 
older have heart failure—some 5.8 million 
people. Of these, about half have systolic heart 
failure.1
 Patients with systolic heart failure can 
be classified by degree of severity under two 
systems: 
The New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
classifies patients by their functional sta￾tus, from I (no limitation in activities) to IV 
(symptoms at rest). NYHA class III (symptoms 
with minimal exertion) is sometimes further 
broken down into IIIa and IIIb, with the latter 
defined as having a recent history of dyspnea 
at rest. 
The joint American College of Cardiol￾ogy and American Heart Association (ACC/
AHA) classification uses four stages, from A 
(high risk of developing heart failure, ie, hav￾ing risk factors such as family history of heart 
disease, hypertension, or diabetes) to D (ad￾vanced heart disease despite treatment). Pa￾tients in stage D tend to be recurrently hos￾pitalized despite cardiac resynchronization 
therapy and drug therapy, and they cannot 
be safely discharged without specialized inter￾ventions. The options for these patients are 
limited: either end-of-life care or extraordi￾MEDICAL GRAND ROUNDS

nary measures such as heart transplantation, 
long-term treatment with inotropic drugs, 
permanent mechanical circulatory support, or 
experimental therapies.2
The estimated number of people in ACC/
AHA stage D or NYHA class IV is 15,600 to
156,000. The approximate number of heart 
transplants performed in the United States 
each year is 2,100.3
■ WHICH AMBULATORY PATIENTS 
ARE MOST AT RISK?
The range for the estimated number of pa￾tients with advanced heart failure (NYHA 
class IIIb or IV) is wide (see above) because 
these patients may be hard to recognize. The 
most debilitated patients are obvious: they 
tend to be in the intensive care unit with end￾organ failure. However, it is a challenge to rec￾ognize patients at extremely high risk who are 
still ambulatory. 
The European Society of Cardiology4
 de￾veloped a definition of advanced chronic heart 
failure that can help identify patients who 
are candidates for the transplant list and for 
an LVAD. All the following features must be 
present despite optimal therapy that includes 
diuretics, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin￾aldosterone system, and beta-blockers, unless 
these are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, 
and cardiac resynchronization therapy if indi￾cated:
•	 Severe symptoms, with dyspnea or fatigue 
at rest or with minimal exertion (NYHA 
class III or IV)
•	 Episodes of fluid retention (pulmonary or 
systemic congestion, peripheral edema) or 
of reduced cardiac output at rest (periph￾eral hypoperfusion)
•	 Objective evidence of severe cardiac dys￾function (at least one of the following): 
left ventricular ejection fraction less than 
30%, pseudonormal or restrictive mitral 
inflow pattern on Doppler echocardiog￾raphy, high left or right ventricular fill￾ing pressure (or both left and right filling 
pressures), and elevated B-type natriuretic 
peptides
•	 Severely impaired functional capacity 
demonstrated by one of the following: in￾ability to exercise, 6-minute walk test dis￾tance less than 300 m (or less in women 
or patients who are age 75 and older), or 
peak oxygen intake less than 12 to 14 mL/
kg/min
•	 One or more hospitalizations for heart fail￾ure in the past 6 months.
Treadmill exercise time is an easily per￾formed test. Hsich et al5
 found that the lon￾ger patients can walk, the lower their risk of 
death, and that this variable is about as pre￾dictive of survival in patients with systolic left 
ventricular dysfunction as peak oxygen con￾sumption, which is much more cumbersome 
to measure. 
The Seattle Heart Failure Model gives 
an estimate of prognosis for ambulatory pa￾tients with advanced heart failure. Available 
at http://depts.washington.edu/shfm/, it is 
based on age, sex, NYHA class, weight, ejec￾tion fraction, blood pressure, medications, a 
few laboratory values, and other clinical infor￾mation. The model has been validated in nu￾merous cohorts,6
 but it may underestimate risk 
and is currently being tested in clinical trials 
(REVIVE-IT and ROADMAP; see at www.
clinicaltrials.gov). 
Recurrent hospitalization is a simple pre￾dictor of risk. A study of about 7,000 patients 
worldwide found that after hospitalization 
with acute decompensated heart failure, the 
strongest predictor of death within 6 months 
was readmission for any reason within 30 days 
of the index hospitalization (Starling RC, un￾published observation, 2011). Any patient 
with heart failure who is repeatedly hospital￾ized should have a consultation with a heart 
failure specialist.
■ INOTROPIC THERAPY FOR BRIDGING
Inotropic drugs, which include intravenous 
dobutamine (Dobutrex) and milrinone (Pri￾macor), are used to help maintain end-organ 
function until a patient can obtain a heart 
transplant or LVAD. 
Inotropic therapy should not be viewed
as an alternative to heart transplantation or 
device implantation. We inform patients that 
inotropic therapy is purely palliative and may 
actually increase the risk of death, which is 
about 50% at 6 months and nearly 100% at 
1 year. A patient on inotropic therapy who

is not a candidate for a transplant or for an 
assist device should be referred to a hospice 
program.7
■ CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION: 
SUCCESSES, CHALLENGES 
Survival rates after heart transplantation are 
now excellent. The 1-year survival rate is 
about 90%, the 5-year rate is about 70%, but 
only about 20% survive 20 years or longer.8,9
The prognosis is not as good as for combined 
heart-lung transplantation patients. 
Age is an important factor and is a conten￾tious issue: some medical centers will not offer 
transplantation to patients over age 65. Oth￾ers regard age as just another risk factor, like 
renal dysfunction or diabetes. 
Quality of life after heart transplantation is 
excellent: patients are usually able to return to 
work, regardless of their profession. 
The leading cause of death after heart
transplantation is malignancy, followed by 
coronary artery vasculopathy, then by graft 
failure. Some patients develop left ventricu￾lar dysfunction and heart failure of unknown 
cause. Others develop antibody-mediated 
rejection; in recent years this has been more 
promptly recognized, but treatment remains a 
challenge. 
Acute rejection, which used to be one of
the main causes of death, now has an extreme￾ly low incidence because of modern drug ther￾apies. In a US observational study currently 
being conducted in about 200 patients receiv￾ing a heart transplant (details on CTOT-05 at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov), the incidence of mod￾erate rejection during the first year is less than 
10% (Starling RC, unpublished observation). 
But several concerns remain. 
Adverse effects of immunosuppressive drugs
continue to be problematic. These include in￾fection, malignancy, osteoporosis, chronic kid￾ney toxicity, hypertension, and neuropathy. 
Renal dysfunction is one of the largest is￾sues. About 10% of heart transplant recipi￾ents develop stage 4 kidney disease (with a 
glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min) and 
need kidney transplantation or renal replace￾ment therapy because of the use of calcineurin 
inhibitors for immunosuppression.10
Coronary artery vasculopathy was the larg￾est problem when heart transplantation began 
and continues to be a major concern and focus 
of research.11,12 Case 1 (below) is an example 
of the problem.
Case 1: 
Poor outcome despite an ideal scenario
A 57-year-old businessman had dilated car￾diomyopathy and progressive heart failure for 
10 years. He was listed for transplantation in 
2008 and was given an LVAD (HeartMate II, 
Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) as a bridge 
until a donor heart became available. 
In 2009, he received a heart transplant
under ideal conditions: the donor was a large 
30-year-old man who died of a gunshot wound 
to the head in the same city in which the pa￾tient and transplant hospital were located. 
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was not per￾formed, and the cold ischemic time was just 
a little more than 3 hours. Immune indicators 
were ideal with a negative prospective cross￾match. 
Laboratory results after transplantation in￾cluded creatinine 1.7 mg/dL (normal 0.6–1.2 
mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
75 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein choles￾terol 64 mg/dL, and triglycerides 90 mg/dL. 
The patient was given immunosuppres￾sive therapy with cyclosporine (Neoral), 
mycophenolate (CellCept), and prednisone. 
Because his creatinine level was high, he was 
also perioperatively given basiliximab (Simu￾lect), a monoclonal antibody to the alpha 
chain (CD25) of the interleukin-2 receptor. 
(In a patient who has poor renal function, 
basilixumab may help by enabling us to delay 
the use of calcineurin inhibitors.) He also re￾ceived simvastatin (Zocor) 10 mg. 
Per Cleveland Clinic protocol, he un￾derwent 13 biopsy procedures during his first 
year, and each was normal (grade 0 or 1R). 
Evaluation by cardiac catheterization at 1 year 
showed some irregularities in the left anterior 
descending artery, but a stent was not deemed 
necessary. Also, per protocol, he underwent 
intravascular ultrasonography, which revealed 
abnormal thickness in the intima and media, 
indicating that coronary artery disease was de￾veloping, although it was nonobstructive.
Two months after this checkup, the pa￾tient collapsed and suddenly died while shop￾A simple

ping. At autopsy, his left anterior descending 
artery was found to be severely obstructed.
Coronary artery vasculopathy 
is still a major problem
This case shows that coronary artery vasculop￾athy may develop despite an ideal transplanta￾tion scenario. It remains a large concern and a 
focus of research.
Coronary vasculopathy develops in 30%
to 40% of heart transplant recipients within 5 
years, and the incidence has not been reduced 
by much over the years. However, probably 
fewer than 5% of these patients die or even 
need bypass surgery or stenting, and the prob￾lem is managed the same as native athero￾sclerosis. We perform routine annual cardiac 
catheterizations or stress tests, or both, and 
place stents in severely blocked arteries. 
■ THE DONOR SHORTAGE: 
CHANGING HOW HEARTS ARE ALLOCATED
The number of patients receiving a heart 
transplant in the United States—about 2,000 
per year—has not increased in the past de￾cade. The European Union also has great dif￾ficulty obtaining hearts for people in need, and 
almost every transplant candidate there gets 
mechanical support for some time. The gap 
between those listed for transplant and the 
number transplanted each year continues to 
widen in both the United States and Europe. 
All transplant candidates are assigned a
status by the United Network of Organ Shar￾ing (UNOS) based on their medical condi￾tion. The highest status, 1A, goes to patients 
who are seriously ill, in the hospital, on high 
doses of inotropic drugs (specific dosages are 
defined) and mechanical circulatory support 
such as an LVAD, and expected to live less 
than 1 month without a transplant. Status 
1B patients are stable on lower-dose inotropic 
therapy or on mechanical support, and can be 
in the hospital or at home. Status 2 patients 
are stable and ambulatory and are not on ino￾tropic drugs. 
In July 2006, UNOS changed the rules on 
how patients are prioritized for obtaining an 
organ. The new rules are based both on sever￾ity of illness (see above) and geographic prox￾imity to the donor heart—local, within 500 
miles (“zone A”) or within 500 to 1,000 miles 
(“zone B”). The order of priority for donor 
hearts is:
•	 Local, status 1A
•	 Local, status 1B
•	 Zone A, status 1A
•	 Zone A, status 1B
•	 Local, status 2
•	 Zone B, status 1A
•	 Zone B, status 1B
•	 Zone A, status 2.
As a result of the change, donor hearts
that become available in a particular hospital 
do not necessarily go to a patient in that state. 
Another result is that status 2 patients, who 
were previously the most common transplant 
recipients, now have much less access because 
all status 1 patients within 500 miles are given 
higher priority. Since the change, only 8% 
of hearts nationwide go to status 2 patients, 
which is 67% fewer than before. At the same 
time, organs allocated to status 1A patients 
have increased by 26%, and their death rates 
have fallen.3
The new allocation system is a positive
change for the sickest patients, providing 
quicker access and a reduction in waiting-list 
mortality.13 The drawback is that status 2 pa￾tients who are less ill are less likely to ever re￾ceive an organ until their condition worsens. 
Heart transplant outcomes 
are publicly reported 
The Scientific Registry of Transplant Re￾cipients publicly reports heart transplant 
outcomes (www.srtr.org). For any transplant 
center, the public can learn the number of 
patients waiting for a transplant, the death 
rate on the waiting list, the number of trans￾plants performed in the previous 12 months, 
the waiting time in months, and observed and 
risk-adjusted expected survival rates. A center 
that deviates from the expected survival rates 
by 10% or more may be audited and could lose 
its certification. 
Also listed on the Web site is the percent￾age of patients who receive a support device 
before receiving a transplant. This can vary 
widely between institutions and may reflect 
the organ availability at the transplant center 
(waiting times) or the preferences and exper￾tise of the transplantation team. We believe

that the mortality rate on the waiting list will 
be reduced with appropriate use of LVADs as 
a bridge to transplantation when indicated. 
We have now transitioned to the use of the 
improved continuous-flow LVADs and rarely 
maintain patients on continuous inotropic 
therapy at home to await a donor organ.
■ MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT: 
BRIDGE OR DESTINATION?
Mechanical circulatory support devices are in￾creasingly being used to sustain patients with 
advanced heart failure. Currently at Cleve￾land Clinic, more LVADs are implanted than 
hearts are transplanted. 
Mechanical circulatory support is indi￾cated for patients who are listed for transplant 
to keep them functioning as well as possible 
while they are waiting (bridge to transplant). 
For others it is “destination therapy”: they are 
not candidates for a transplant, but a device 
may improve and prolong the rest of their life. 
Case 2: 
A good outcome despite a poor prognosis
A 71-year-old man was rejected for transplan￾tation by his local hospital because of his age 
and also because he had pulmonary artery 
hypertension (78/42 mm Hg; reference range 
15–30/5–15 mm Hg) and creatinine elevation 
(3.0 mg/dL; reference range 0.6–1.5 mg/dL). 
Nevertheless, he did well on a mechanical de￾vice and was accepted for transplantation by 
Cleveland Clinic. He received a transplant 
and is still alive and active 14 years later. 
Comment. Determining that a patient is 
not a good transplantation candidate is often 
impossible. Putting the patient on mechani￾cal support for a period of time can often help 
clarify whether transplantation is advisable. 
Probably most patients who receive mechani￾cal support do so as a bridge to decision: most 
are acutely ill and many have organ dysfunc￾tion, pulmonary hypertension, and renal in￾sufficiency. After a period of support, they can 
be assessed for suitability for transplantation. 
LVADs continue to improve
Many devices are available for mechanical cir￾culatory support.14 In addition to LVADs, there 
are right-ventricular assist devices (RVADs), 
and devices that simultaneously support both 
ventricles (BiVADs). Total artificial hearts are 
also available, as are acute temporary percu￾taneous devices. These temporary devices—
TandemHeart (CardiacAssist, Pittsburgh, PA) 
and Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MD)—can 
be used before a long-term mechanical device 
can be surgically implanted.
LVADs are of three types:
•	 Pulsatile volume-displacement pumps, which 
mimic the pumping action of the natural 
heart. These early devices were large and 
placed in the abdomen.
•	 Continuous axial-flow pumps, which do 
not have a “heartbeat.” These are quieter 
and lighter than the early pumps, and use a 
turbine that spins at 8,000 to 10,000 rpm.
•	 Continuous centrifugal-flow pumps. These 
have a rotor spinning at 2,000 to 3,000 
rpm, and most of them are magnetically 
powered and suspended. 
The superiority of LVADs over medical 
therapy was clearly shown even in early stud￾ies that used pulsatile LVADs.15 The results of 
such studies and the increased durability of the 
devices have led to their rapidly expanded use.
The newer continuous-flow pumps offer
significant improvements over the old pulsa￾tile-flow pumps, being smaller, lighter, quieter, 
and more durable (TABLE 1). A 2007 study of 
133 patients on a continuous axial-flow LVAD 
(HeartMate II) found that 76% were still alive 
after 6 months, and patients had significant 
improvement in functional status and quality 
of life.16 In a postapproval study based on reg￾istry data, HeartMate II was found superior to 
pulsatile pumps in terms of survival up to 12 
months, percentage of patients reaching trans￾plant, and cardiac recovery. Adverse event 
rates were similar or lower for HeartMate II.17 
Another study compared a continuous￾flow with a pulsatile-flow LVAD for patients 
who were ineligible for transplantation. Sur￾vival at 2 years was 58% with the continuous￾flow device vs 24% with the pulsatile-flow de￾vice (P = .008).18 Since then, postmarket data 
of patients who received an LVAD showed 
that 85% are still alive at 1 year.19 This study 
can be viewed as supporting the use of LVADs 
as destination therapy.
Quality of life for patients receiving an
LVAD has been excellent. When biventricu￾Currently at 
Cleveland Clinic, 
more LVADs 
are implanted 
than hearts are 
transplanted

Many patients 
receive LVADs 
as a ‘bridge’ 
before trans￾plantation
lar pacemakers for resynchronization therapy 
first became available, distances on the 6-minute 
walk test improved by 39 m, which was deemed a 
big improvement. LVAD devices have increased 
the 6-minute walk distance by 156 m.20
Adverse events with LVADs have improved, 
but continue to be of concern
Infections can arise in the blood stream, 
in the device pocket, or especially where the 
driveline exits the skin. As devices have be￾come smaller, driveline diameters have be￾come smaller as well, allowing for a better seal 
at the skin and making this less of a problem. 
Some centers report the incidence of driveline 
infections as less than 20%, but they continue 
to be a focus of concern.18
Stroke rates continue to improve, although 
patients still require intensive lifelong antico￾agulation. The target international normalized 
ratio varies by device manufacturer, ranging 
from 1.7 to 2.5. 
Bleeding. Acquired von Willebrand syn￾drome can develop in patients who have an 
LVAD, with the gastrointestinal system being 
the most frequent site of bleeding.21
Device thrombosis occurs very rarely 
(2%–3%) but is very serious and may require 
pump exchange. 
Mechanical malfunction. As duration of 
therapy lengthens, problems are arising with 
aging devices, such as broken wires or short 
circuits. New-generation pumps have mark￾edly improved durability and reliability. 
Good data are kept on device outcomes
The Interagency for Mechanically Assisted Cir￾culatory Support (INTERMACS) maintains 
a national registry of patients with a mechani￾cal circulatory support device to treat advanced 
heart failure. It was jointly established in 2006 by 
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS), the US Food and Drug Administration, 
and others. Reporting to INTERMACS is re￾quired for CMS reimbursement.
The INTERMACS database now has
about 4,500 patients at 126 medical centers 
and is yielding useful information that is pub￾lished in annual reports.22 The 2011 report 
focused on the experience with mechanical 
circulatory support as destination therapy and 
showed that patients who receive continuous￾flow pumps have significantly better survival 
rates than those with pulsatile-flow pumps.23
An earlier report showed that the level of 
illness at the time of implantation predicts 
survival24; this information now drives cardi￾ologists to try to improve patient status with 
a temporary support device or intra-aortic 
balloon pump before implanting a durable 
device. The sickest patients (INTERMACS

level 1) have the poorest outcomes, and cen￾ters now do fewer implantations in patients in 
this category. We have learned this important 
lesson from the INTERMACS registry. 
The new devices have received a lot of me￾dia attention, and patient accrual has increased 
steadily as the devices have been approved.
On November 20, 2012, the US Food and 
Drug Administration approved the Heart￾Ware Ventricular Assist System (HeartWare, 
Framingham, MA) for heart failure patients 
awaiting a transplant. 
■ FUTURE DIRECTIONS
PROCEED II is an ongoing global clinical tri￾al comparing the outcomes with donor hearts 
transported in standard cold storage to those 
transported in an experimental transport de￾vice that pumps the heart under physiologic 
conditions. If proven effective, this device 
could allow long-distance transport of donor 
hearts and expand the donor population. 
A prospective, randomized study is now en￾rolling patients to evaluate induction therapy 
with rituximab (Rituxan) plus conventional 
immunosuppression (tacrolimus [Prograf], my￾cophenolate, steroid taper) vs placebo induc￾tion plus conventional immunosuppression. 
The study will enroll 400 patients (200 to 
each treatment arm) at 25 sites and will have 
a 36-month accrual period with 12-month 
follow-up (see http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/
NCT01278745). The study is based on data 
in primates that found that eliminating B cells 
with an anti-CD20 drug before transplantation 
markedly reduced the incidence of coronary 
artery vasculopathy. ■
