Abstract
BACKGROUND AND AIMS Altered intestinal permeability is a key


pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. We
investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel
flora can alter colonic permeability.
METHODS A colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal
transit and brought out as a loop to the abdominal wall through
two colostomies. The loop was used for colonisation with specific
bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with
antibiotics. Lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight
70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats
recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin,
and in control rats whose colonic loop was kept free of bacteria by
antibiotics. Actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of
segment effluents.
RESULTS Colonisation with Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,
andStreptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood
clearance of mannitol. Colonisation withLactobacillus brevis had the
opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. Bacteroides
fragilis did not induce significant changes. Permeability to dextran
was not altered by any of the strains tested.
CONCLUSIONS Certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic
wall permeability to luminal substances.
