Red Cell Disorders
Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder
of the β-globin gene, in which hemoglobin-S polymerizes in
erythrocytes under deoxygenated conditions, causing occlu￾sion of the small blood vessels. Pain is the clinical hallmark of
SCD with painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) being com￾mon, debilitating, and a medical emergency.1 VOE are the
leading cause of admission to hospital, emergency room visits,
missed school, and are associated with an increased mortality
rate.2 Nationally, 78% of the nearly 200,000 annual emergency
department visits for SCD are for a complaint of pain,3 yet
there is no effective therapy that targets the underlying mech￾anisms of VOE. Symptomatic relief with analgesics and hydra￾tion is the only currently available treatment, and this has not
changed in decades. Episodic periods of severe pain lead to
high use of health care resources,4 and high readmission rates
within 72 hours despite initial hospitalization for pain man￾agement.2 Hospital admission rates are particularly high for
children with SCD5 presenting to an emergency department
with VOE, with pediatric hospitalization rates commonly
over 60%.6 Although the reasons for high pediatric admission
rates are unknown, many children and adults with SCD live
with some degree of daily pain that they or their families try
to control at home through various methods. It is when the
pain becomes acutely worse, and unbearable, that they pres￾ent to the emergency department, often in acute distress.
Novel approaches to the treatment of acute pain in SCD,
which could be utilized in the emergency department as well
as on the hospital ward, are urgently needed. 
Vaso-occlusion is believed to be the root cause of sickle cell
pain. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator7 that plays a
role in the vaso-occlusive complications of SCD.8-11 NO is pro￾duced in the endothelium from its obligate substrate L-argi￾nine, which is converted to citrulline by a family of enzymes,
the NO synthases (NOS).7 Although NOS expression and
activity are increased, SCD is characterized by a state of NO
resistance, NO inactivation, and impaired NO bioavailabili￾ty.10,12,13 Under conditions of increased inflammation or oxida￾tive stress, the compensatory up-regulation of NO likely
becomes overwhelmed and ineffective resulting in vascular
dysfunction.11 Normal arginine metabolism is also impaired in
SCD,14-19 and differs in children compared to adults.16 We
found that adults with SCD are arginine-deficient at steady￾state,11,16 whereas children have plasma levels that are similar
to those of normal controls in steady-state.16 However, plas￾ma arginine concentration decreases significantly in both
adults and children with VOE and is associated with low NO

Painful episodes of vaso-occlusion are the leading cause of hospitalizations and emergency department visits in
sickle cell disease, and are associated with increased mortality. Low nitric oxide bioavailability contributes to vas￾culopathy in sickle cell disease. Since arginine is the obligate substrate for nitric oxide production, and an acute
deficiency is associated with pain, we hypothesized that arginine may be a beneficial treatment for pain related
to sickle cell disease. Thirty-eight children with sickle cell disease hospitalized for 56 episodes of pain were ran￾domized into this double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. Patients received L-arginine (100 mg/kg tid) or placebo
for 5 days or until discharge. A significant reduction in total parenteral opioid use by 54% (1.9±2.0 mg/kg versus
4.1±4.1 mg/kg, P=0.02) and lower pain scores at discharge (1.9±2.4 versus 3.9±2.9, P=0.01) were observed in the
treatment arm compared to the placebo one. There was no significant difference in hospital length of stay
(4.1±01.8 versus 4.8±2.5 days, P=0.34), although a trend favored the arginine arm, and total opioid use was strongly
correlated with the duration of the admission (r=0.86, P<0.0001). No drug-related adverse events were observed.
Arginine therapy represents a novel intervention for painful vaso-occlusive episodes. A reduction of narcotic use
by >50% is remarkable. Arginine is a safe and inexpensive intervention with narcotic-sparing effects that may be
a beneficial adjunct to standard therapy for sickle cell-related pain in children. A large multi-center trial is warrant￾ed in order to confirm these observations. (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01796678)

metabolite (NOx) levels.16 The lowest arginine levels were
found in children requiring admission for VOE,16 with argi￾nine levels returning to baseline during convalescence in
the hospital. Of interest, low plasma arginine alone was a
sensitive predictor for admission,16 while NOx levels were
not, suggesting a function for arginine bioavailability in
VOE severity that goes beyond NO. Although supplemen￾tal arginine increases plasma NOx in normal controls,
when given to SCD patients at steady-state, a paradoxical
decrease in NOx occurs that is not overcome by higher
doses,20 indicating that arginine is metabolized differently
in patients with SCD than in healthy volunteers.
However, when a single dose of arginine is given to
patients with SCD during VOE, there is a robust dose￾dependent increase in plasma NOx.
20 Based on these prom￾ising data, we designed a randomized, placebo-controlled
trial to determine the safety and efficacy of arginine ther￾apy in children with SCD requiring hospitalization for
severe pain necessitating parenteral narcotics.
Methods
Study design
This study was a single-center, prospective, randomized, dou￾ble-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial designed to explore the
effectiveness of the arginine intervention in participants with SCD
requiring hospitalization for VOE. Data outcome measures includ￾ed length of stay (LOS) in hospital (days), total narcotic use over
the course of the emergency department visit and hospitalization
(mg/kg), and pain scores (10-cm linear visual analog scale and
Faces Pain Scale). Further details are provided in the Online
Supplementary Methods.
Standard intravenous (IV) opioid analgesic equivalents were
used: 10 mg morphine sulfate = 100 mg meperidine = 2 mg hydro￾morphone hydrochloride. A hospital admission for a pain episode
was considered a distinct event if it occurred more than 2 weeks
after a previous pain episode requiring parenteral opioid therapy.
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the Children’s Hospital & Research Center at Oakland
(CHRCO): informed consent was obtained for all patients
enrolled, and assent was obtained from all children age 7 years and
older. Children with an established diagnosis of SCD age 3-19
years with VOE requiring parenteral opioids and admission to
hospital were recruited from emergency departments, hematology
clinics, day hospitals and wards. Patients were recruited as a con￾venience sample during times when the principal investigator or
study nurse was on-site and available to consent, a legal guardian
was present, and the research pharmacist was available to perform
the randomization. 
Patients were consented within 24 hours of admission to the
hospital and randomized to receive IV or oral (PO) study drug, L￾arginine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg/dose three times/day with a
maximum dose of 10 g for 15 doses or until discharge, whichever
occurred first) or placebo. Placebo capsules appeared identical to
the study drug (700 mg capsules) and were matched to the study
drug by Tyson Pharmaceuticals for color and size, while normal
saline was used for the IV placebo. Block randomization was per￾formed by the hospital pharmacist at CHRCO. Exclusion criteria
included known hepatic or renal insufficiency, presenting hemo￾globin (Hb) <5 g/dL or immediate need for red blood cell transfu￾sion, pregnancy, mental status changes or concern for stroke, >10
hospital admissions per year or a history of dependence on opi￾oids, or a known allergy to arginine. A standardized treatment and
monitoring program for VOE, utilized by CHRCO, was followed.
Safety and efficacy
Safety assessments included reports of adverse events (AE) and
serious adverse events (SAE), clinical laboratory assessments,
physical examination, vital signs, development of acute chest syn￾drome (ACS), and need for red blood cell transfusion. Safety and
efficacy assessments were conducted at baseline, at discharge, and
during routine clinical blood sampling. It was standard clinical
practice to analyze the complete blood count with hemoglobin
concentration and reticulocyte count during an emergency depart￾ment visit for pain, while a complete metabolic panel and repeat
complete blood count were performed when clinically indicated.
Efficacy was judged by a statistically significant decrease in LOS in
hospital, total narcotic use or pain score in the arginine treatment
arm compared to in the placebo one. 
Statistical analysis 
The statistical analysis of the data is described in the Online
Supplementary Material.
Results
Patients’ characteristics 
Figure 1 summarizes the CONSORT flow diagram for
enrollment and analysis. A total of 38 patients with 56 dis￾tinct VOE completed randomization and received the
study drug or placebo in this prospective, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial, 28 in each arm (arginine versus
placebo). Two patients randomized to the arginine arm
received IV ketorolac only for pain and no parenteral nar￾cotics throughout their hospital stay, a requirement for eli￾gibility. These patients were excluded from analyses after
the study was unblinded and total opioid use was calculat￾ed. Therefore, 54 VOE events were analyzed in total.
Table 1 summarizes the patients’ demographics and clini￾cal parameters while Table 2 includes laboratory parame￾ters collected as part of clinical care. Forty-seven episodes
(85.5%) were evaluated in the emergency department,
while seven patients were admitted to the ward directly
from a hematology clinic or day hospital. The average age
of the patients was 13.9 ± 4 years (range, 3.6-19 years),
and 53% were female. Seventy-three percent of the pain
episodes involved children with Hb-SS, 18% had Hb-SC,
and 9% carried S-β thalassemia. Age and gender were
equally distributed between groups, and there were no
significant differences in sickle-hemoglobin genotype,
oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, fever, severity of ane￾mia, reticulocyte count, white blood cell count, pain
scores, time to first parenteral opioid from presentation to
triage, or therapeutic interventions (ketoralac, benadryl,
antibiotics, intravenous fluid use) between the study arms.
At presentation (day 1), systolic blood pressure was higher
in the arginine arm than in the placebo arm. 
The overall time between triage in the emergency
department or presentation to the clinic and delivery of
first randomized study drug dose was 20.4±11 hours, with
no difference between the placebo and treatment arms. 
Five patients (9%) withdrew from the study after initia￾tion of the study drug (3 in the arginine arm and 2 in the
placebo arm). Of these patients, three adolescents were no
longer interested in participating (2 in the arginine arm,
and 1 in the placebo arm), and asked to withdraw from
the study without providing a particular reason. Two
patients were withdrawn by the principal investigator for
adverse events although the study drug code was not

unblinded until after completion of the study. One patient
in the arginine arm developed hives, considered possibly
related to the study drug, and a second patient experi￾enced clinical deterioration during the evolution of ACS
(placebo arm, see adverse events). In a protocol deviation,
one patient randomized to the placebo arm was erro￾neously crossed over for three doses of arginine due to a
pharmacy medication error. 
Effects of arginine on length of stay in hospital
The mean LOS was 4.5±2.2 days. There was not a sig￾nificant difference between the two groups (mean±SD:
4.1±1.8 versus 4.8±2.5 days, P=0.34; arginine versus place￾bo arm), although the LOS tended to be shorter in the
patients treated with arginine. 
When patients receiving oral therapy only were exclud￾ed (n=6), the mean LOS for the IV arginine arm decreased
by 2.4 hours while that for the IV placebo arm was
unchanged (4.0±1.8 versus 4.8±2.5 days, P=0.20).
Interestingly, LOS decreased over time for unclear reasons
from 6±3 days for all admissions in 1998 at CHRCO (data
used for sample size calculation) to 4.5±2.2 days in our
study cohort from 2000-2008, a trend that has continued
at this institution with a 2012 mean LOS of 3.3±2.2 days
(n=124 VOE admissions).21
Effects of arginine on total opioid use
The majority of episodes (50/54; 93%) were treated
with IV morphine sulfate as the parenteral opioid to treat
pain, while three events were treated with IV hydromor￾phone and one event was treated with IV meperidine. A
54% significant reduction in total opioid use (mg/kg) over
the course of the hospital stay was observed in patients in
the treatment arm receiving arginine compared to those in
the placebo arm (mean±SD: 1.9±2.0 mg/kg; n=26 versus
4.1±4.1 mg/kg; n=26, P=0.02; Figure 2A). Total opioid use
correlated strongly with LOS in hospital (r=0.86,
P<0.0001; Figure 2B).
When patients receiving oral therapy only were exclud￾ed (n=6), the total opioid use (mg/kg) was similarly
reduced (mean±SD: 2.0±2.0 mg/kg; n=23 versus 4.2 ± 4.1
mg/kg; n=23, P=0.03) in the IV arginine versus placebo
groups.

received no parenteral opi￾oids throughout their
admission, an eligibility cri￾terion. Narcotic records
were incomplete for two
patients randomized to the
placebo arm; these two
patients were excluded
from the total opioid use

randomized to the placebo
arm received three doses
of arginine due to a phar￾macy error. A total of five
patients were withdrawn
from the study and inter￾vention discontinued, how￾ever their data were includ￾ed in the intent-to-treat

highest total opioid treatment were excluded from analy￾sis, the difference between the arginine and placebo arms
remained statistically significant (1.9±2.0 mg/kg; n=26 ver￾sus 3.1±2.4 mg/kg; n=24, P=0.04).
Effects of arginine on pain scores
Pain scores, based on a 10-cm visual analog scale from 0
to 10 and recorded in the emergency department or in the
clinic during the initial presentation, were similar in both
the arginine and placebo groups (Figure 3). As expected,
pain scores had decreased significantly in both the argi￾nine and placebo arms at the time of discharge compared
to the initial evaluation. However pain scores were signif￾icantly lower at discharge in the arginine arm than in the
placebo arm (mean±SD: 1.9±2.4 versus 3.9±2.9, P=0.01).
Comparing the differences in the change from presenta￾tion (day 1) to day of discharge adjusting for day 1 values
between the placebo and arginine arms, the decrease in
pain scores was larger in the arginine arm than in the
placebo arm (P=0.01). 
The impact of arginine therapy on pain scores at dis￾charge was similar when patients receiving oral therapy
only (n=6) were excluded (1.7±2.0 versus 3.9±3.0, P=0.03,
arginine versus placebo).
Effects of arginine on clinical and laboratory parameters
Arginine had no impact on blood pressure, heart rate or
laboratory parameters compared to placebo, although sys￾tolic blood pressure and white blood cell count decreased
similarly in both groups at discharge compared to the val￾ues at admission for VOE. In patients for whom data were
available, no significant differences were observed
between subjects in the arginine treatment group or place￾bo group with regards to pre- and post-therapy liver
enzymes (alanine and aspartate transaminases), total/indi￾rect bilirubin, renal function (blood-urea nitrogen or crea￾tinine), or hemoglobin concentration. At discharge there
was a trend towards lower reticulocyte count in the argi￾nine arm (mean±SD: 10.3±6 to 8.4±5%, P=0.08, n=25)
compared to the placebo arm (9.7±7 to 9.4±7%, P=0.99,
n=23) and a trend towards higher oxygen saturation in the
arginine arm (P=0.06). As expected during VOE admis￾sions, mean hemoglobin dropped significantly from pres￾entation within 24 hours (9.4±1.7 versus 8.6±1.7 g/dL,
P<0.0001, n=38 with day 2 measurements) in the group as
a whole, when day 2 measurements were available; how￾ever, there was no difference in the hemoglobin concen￾tration at discharge in the arginine arm compared to the
placebo arm (Table 2). Although only a limited number of
patients had blood chemistry analyses performed on
admission, 85% (46/54) of patients had a comprehensive

metabolic panel performed prior to discharge. There were
no statistically or clinically significant differences between
liver function tests or creatinine levels at discharge,
although blood urea nitrogen tended to increase in the
arginine arm, with a statistically significant, but not clini￾cally relevant difference between the two groups (10±4
versus 7±3, P=0.02). When using an analysis of covariance
model comparing the differences in the change from ini￾tial presentation (day 1) to day of discharge adjusting for
day 1 values between the placebo and arginine arms, it
was noted that the increase in oxygen saturation was larg￾er in the arginine group than in the placebo group
(P=0.05), while there was a greater decrease in platelet
count in the placebo group after treatment than in the argi￾nine group. No other significant changes in clinical or lab￾oratory variables between presentation and discharge,
including blood-urea nitrogen, were noted in the two
groups in this analysis.
Four episodes of ACS, defined as a fever and new infil￾trates on a chest radiograph, developed in the study par￾ticipants, three in the treatment arm and one in the place￾bo arm. None had fever during their initial presentation in
the emergency department. One patient (in the placebo
arm) experienced clinical deterioration associated with
ACS during hospitalization requiring emergency transfu￾sion and transfer from the ward to the pediatric intensive
care unit. No clinical deterioration or transfers to the pedi￾atric intensive care unit occurred in the arginine arm. Nine
patients received red blood cell transfusions during the
hospitalization, five in the treatment arm and four in the
placebo arm. All patients who developed ACS (n=4)
received a blood transfusion.
Repeat enrollment
After excluding two patients from the arginine group
who did not receive any IV opioids for their pain, 36
unique patients were evaluated for 54 distinct, independ￾ent pain episodes requiring hospitalization. Over an 8-
year period, nine patients were enrolled twice, two
patients enrolled three times, and two patients enrolled
four times. The mean time between re-enrollment for all
participants was 13.7±11 months. Mean±SD total opioid
use was 1.98±1.5 versus 3.05±1.9 mg/kg (P=0.11) for argi￾nine versus placebo recipients, respectively, in a paired
analysis of patients randomized to both arms (n=5 paired
events for 10 VOE admissions). When only unique
patients were analyzed (n=36; 18 in the placebo arm and
18 receiving arginine), using their first presentation for
pain in the emergency department for analysis, total opi￾oid use (1.9±2.0 versus 3.7±4.0 mg/kg, P=0.11, arginine ver￾sus placebo), LOS in hospital (4.2±1.6 versus 5.0±3 days,
P=0.22, arginine versus placebo) and pain scores at dis￾charge (2.0±3 versus 4.0±3, P=0.14, arginine versus placebo)
were similar to analyses that included all events, although
statistical significance was lost due to the inadequate sam￾ple size.
Adverse events
Three adverse or severe adverse events were reported.
No serious drug-related adverse events were observed,
although one AE and one SAE occurred that led to discon￾tinuation of the study drug, and a decision by the principal
investigator to withdraw the participant from the study
without breaking the blinded study drug code until the
completion of the trial. One patient (randomized to the
arginine arm) developed hives during infusion of the study
drug. Although the patient had a history of allergy to paper
tape, and paper tape had been inadvertently used, the
study drug was discontinued and the patient was with￾Arginine therapy in SCD

to the study drug. A second patient (randomized to the
placebo group) was withdrawn from the study after expe￾riencing an acute clinical deterioration during the evolution
of ACS, requiring an emergency red blood cell transfusion,

transaminase increased from 64 to 200 U/L). The clinical
team felt that this was likely related to SCD, but could pos￾sibly be related to the study drug, so a SAE was reported to
the Institutional Review Board and Data Safety Monitoring
Board, but the patient continued participation in the study
and was closely monitored. No other patients experienced
clinical deterioration, and no other adverse events
occurred. Arginine and placebo were well tolerated.
Discussion
This is the first randomized placebo-controlled study to
demonstrate benefits of arginine therapy in children with
SCD hospitalized for severe pain. Total opioid use
decreased by 54% and pain scores were significantly
lower at discharge in the group treated with arginine com￾pared to the group given placebo. Although the primary
outcome was LOS, and overall mean LOS decreased over
time,21 ultimately the study was not sufficiently powered
to detect a change in LOS. However, the trend to a
decrease by 17 hours in the arginine group was a clinically
relevant improvement for patients and their families.
Given that LOS correlated strongly with total opioid use
(r=0.86, P<0.0001), a larger-scale, multi-center trial is need￾ed to confirm our observations. Delivering the study drug
as early as possible after presentation to the emergency
department or clinic may have a greater impact on LOS,
especially since many patients received their first dose of
medication more than 24 hours into their hospitalized
pain event. Anecdotally it is interesting to note that two
patients with pain severe enough to require admission
randomized to the arginine arm received no parenteral
opioids throughout their hospital stay, although these
patients were excluded from the analysis,.
We have previously demonstrated that a dysregulation
of the arginine metabolome contributes to complications
in SCD, including VOE and early mortality.14,16,22,23 The
mechanistic impact of arginine supplementation cannot
be elucidated by this trial, and is a limitation of this study.
However an impressive back-bone of basic science and
already published pre-clinical efficacy data are now fur￾ther supported by our efficacy findings with regards to
important clinical outcomes such as pain severity and opi￾oid use. In transgenic mouse models of SCD, L-arginine
supplementation inhibits the red cell Gardos channels,24
reduces red cell density,24 improves perfusion, and reduces
lung injury, microvascular vaso-occlusion and mortality.25-
27 Arginine also increases erythrocyte glutathione levels in
both mice25 and humans,28 and may down-regulate
inflammatory pathways.29 In addition, arginine is a key
substrate in creatine synthesis, an important metabolic
pathway not yet sufficiently studied in SCD that may be
affected by an arginine-deficient state. Although the role
of NO in SCD has become controversial,30,31 these studies
demonstrate that the mechanistic impact of arginine goes
beyond NO. Clinically, rapid healing of leg ulcers was
anecdotally reported with oral L-arginine hydrochloride22
and IV arginine-butyrate in both SCD and thalassemia.32
Short-term arginine therapy improved pulmonary hyper￾tension in SCD,22 and acutely increased both plasma NOx
and exhaled NO when administered to ethnically
matched normal controls and SCD patients with VOE.20,33
However when given to SCD patients at steady-state, a
paradoxical decrease in plasma NOx; this decrease is not
overcome by higher doses,20 indicating that arginine is
metabolized differently in SCD than in healthy volun￾teers, and differently in SCD at steady-state than during
periods of acute illness including painful VOE and
ACS.16,20,33 These early observations may explain the neg￾ative outcome of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers’
(CSCC) arginine trial,34 particularly since the primary out￾come measure of that study was an increase in plasma
NOx concentration, a biomarker which actually decreases
with arginine supplementation in SCD patients at steady￾state.20 Furthermore, low-dose arginine therapy is likely to
be sub-therapeutic in SCD, and may represent an addi￾tional flaw in the design of the CSCC prophylactic argi￾nine trial, as doses used were close to placebo based on
the cardiovascular literature.35 Previous studies have
shown that low-dose arginine is unlikely to affect NO
synthesis,35 an observation confirmed in SCD by the
CSCC study.34 Since the capacity of arginine to increase
NOx production in SCD and VOE is dose-dependent,20
higher concentrations of plasma arginine are likely need￾ed29 to overcome multi-factorial effects including the
impact of arginase and asymmetric dimethylarginine
(ADMA) on global arginine bioavailability.11
Independently of SCD, low global arginine bioavailabil￾ity is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events
including mortality in patients screened for cardiovascular
disease,36 coronary artery disease,37 and malaria,38 and is
associated with the risk of pulmonary hypertension.14,23,39
Increased arginase activity from both inflammatory trig￾gers and more significantly from erythrocyte release of
arginase during hemolysis,14 intracellular arginine trans￾port inhibition, renal dysfunction (which impairs the
major route of endogenous arginine biosynthesis),11,23 the
presence of elevated endogenous NOS inhibitors such as
ADMA40-42 (a competitive inhibitor of arginine transport
and NOS43), uncoupled NOS27 and other consequences of
oxidative stress25,26,44,45 lead to low global arginine bioavail￾ability in SCD. Although mechanisms of arginine dysreg￾ulation are complex and multifactorial,11,23 they can be
overcome through arginine supplementation, a phenome￾non known as the “arginine paradox”.46 Arginine may have
greater therapeutic potential than NO gas in SCD47
because of its multi-faceted nature that extends beyond its
function as the obligate NO substrate. Hemolysis will
drive arginine consumption, which will ultimately exacer￾bate NO sequestration and decreased NO synthesis.11
Under conditions of hypoxia, high ADMA, low arginine,
or low levels of essential NOS cofactors,48 NOS will
uncouple, producing reactive oxygen species instead of
NO, further reducing NO bioavailability and adding to the
milieu of oxidative stress. An imbalance between
endothelial NOS-derived NO and superoxide generation
exists in SCD.49 Up-regulation of NOS would, therefore,
enhance oxidative stress when the local milieu favors
NOS uncoupling. Indeed, studies in transgenic sickle cell

mice demonstrate that NOS activity is paradoxically
increased and uncoupled while NO bioavailability is low.27
Inhaled NO gas may be rapidly sequestered by superox￾ide, forming peroxynitrite, which is known to cause lung
damage and cell death. It is plausible that NO and possibly
even sildenafil therapy in SCD may lack therapeutic ben￾efit47,50 in an environment of oxidative stress or in the
absence of sufficient L-arginine bioavailability.
Although all pain episodes were independent events
often separated by years, repeat patient participation was
an unavoidable limitation of this study for feasibility rea￾sons linked to enrollment of children with an orphan dis￾ease in a single center. Nevertheless, the promising results
justify planning a multi-center trial involving a larger
cohort of patients and provided pilot data to enable more
accurate power calculations to determine the required
sample size for desired outcome measures.
Experience with arginine therapy in SCD is grow￾ing,20,22,25,28,33,34 and no safety issues have emerged. We
learned through this study that intravenous administration
is preferred by patients and improves feasibility of study
drug delivery compared to oral administration in the acute
setting. Arginine therapy is a novel intervention for VOE.
A reduction of total opioid use by more than 50% with
arginine therapy is remarkable and was combined with
improved pain scores at discharge. Arginine is a safe and
efficacious intervention with narcotic-sparing effects that
may be a beneficial adjunct to standard therapy for VOE.
A large multi-center trial is warranted in order to confirm
these observations.
