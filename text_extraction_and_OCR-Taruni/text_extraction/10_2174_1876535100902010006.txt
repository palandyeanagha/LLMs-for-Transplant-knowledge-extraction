Abstract: Measurable B-type natriuretic peptides, which are largely produced by the left ventricle, include B-type natri￾uretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). These proteins are released by cardio￾myocytes in response to wall-tension and neurohumoral signals. In this review the literature is summarized to date with 
respect to the approved indications for testing which include the diagnostic evaluation and prognosis of heart failure. 
PubMed in 2009 was searched and 5496 references were reduced to 242 studies that reported on either diagnosis, progno￾sis, screening, or monitoring of heart failure. In head-to-head diagnostic comparisons, 58 studies measured both assays, 
and 11 studies in adults that included at least 100 patients compared commercially available tests. We performed the 
analogous search in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and found 82 articles of which 11 papers focused on the study of 
BNP and NT-proBNP in either stable angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or ST-segment elevation 
myocardial infarction. For heart failure diagnosis, BNP and NT-proBNP had similar decision statistics; however, while 
optimal diagnostic cutpoints for both markers varied depended on age and degree of renal dysfunction, and the clinical 
application; NT-proBNP had a much more widely variable optimal cutpoint than did BNP. Sufficient evidence for clinical 
utility of both tests exists for other applications of prognosis, screening, and monitoring of heart failure. In addition, both 
tests have a role in the risk stratification of all forms of ACS. Future trials of clinical strategies are warranted using these 
tools in advancing both inpatient and outpatient management of heart failure and ACS. 
Keywords: B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, heart failure, diagnosis, prognosis, systematic

INTRODUCTION 
 Recently it has been recognized and shown that tests for 
B-type natriuretic peptide and for the amino terminal frag￾ment NT-proBNP are accurate and useful markers of heart 
failure (HF). These tests have been shown to improve physi￾cians’ ability to diagnose HF in symptomatic patients. Accu￾rate diagnosis of HF without these markers has been difficult 
in the past, particularly in acutely ill patients, in part because 
symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and edema are relatively 
non-specific [1-3]. These symptoms are also common in 
obese and elderly patients with a variety of medical prob￾lems and in those with respiratory disease, making diagnosis 
of HF more challenging [3]. Indeed, the accuracy of clinical 
assessment of HF by history, physical exam, and conven￾tional testing alone has been fallible, particularly in female, 
elderly, and obese patients [4, 5]. 
 BNP and NT-proBNP are invaluable tools for physicians 
to introduce early intervention and to manage patient care [6-
8]. Annual costs of treating HF patients in the United States 
are estimated at $65 billion, 70% of which is due to hospi￾talization. Half of HF patients are readmitted to the hospital 
within 6 months of discharge and 10% are readmitted twice

[9]. Fewer readmissions by BNP or NT-proBNP guided 
therapy can significantly impact the costs associated with 
this prevalent disease. 
 BNP and NT-proBNP have been shown to be sensitive 
and accurate markers of HF and have been shown to be supe￾rior for predicting HF relative to other markers of cardiac 
dysfunction [10-17]. The gene for BNP is located on chro￾mosome 1 (Fig. 1) and can be rapidly activated in response 
to signal transduction from the myocyte cell wall. After pro￾tein synthesis, BNP is cleaved from the precursor molecule, 
proBNP by corin into the active BNP hormone and the inac￾tive NT-proBNP fragment. Biologically active BNP is re￾leased from cardiomyocytes in response to wall tension, 
which according to the law of Laplace, is determined by the 
pressure within and the radius of the chamber. Since the left 
ventricle has the greatest mass by far of all the cardiac 
chambers, these natriuretic peptides largely reflect the dy￾namic wall tension experienced by the left ventricle that oc￾curs with pressure and volume overload and neurohumoral 
activation in heart failure [11,18] with levels of these mark￾ers relating to the severity of HF symptoms and cardiac dys￾function [10,19-21]. In the setting of acute and chronic right 
ventricular pressure overload, both BNP and NT-proBNP 
can be elevated but not typically to the levels seen in left 
ventricular failure. All assays for BNP and NT-proBNP rec￾ognize epitopes on the parent peptide proBNP, thus, in the 
setting of acute decompensated heart failure, it is believed 

Utility of BNP and NT-proBNP Open Heart Failure Journal, 2009, Volume 2 7
that levels of these proteins reflect both “immature” and ma￾ture peptide products [22]. In addition, fragment peptides are 
known to be in the circulation of patients with heart failure 
(BNP3-32 and BP6-32) and glycosylation of both BNP and 
NT-proBNP can occur as with many proteins to a variable 
degree depending on levels of glycemia and circulatory dura￾tions of the peptides [23, 24]. Both BNP and NT-proBNP 
rise quickly in the setting decompensation and have sus￾tained elevation provided increased wall tension and neuro￾humoral activation remain present [12-17]. 
 There are some differences that may affect the relative 
usefulness of these two markers in different patient popula￾tions which will be discussed in this paper. For example, 
BNP has a shorter half-life than NT-proBNP because they 
are cleared by different mechanisms. Thus levels of NT￾proBNP are higher than those of BNP despite being pro￾duced at a theoretical 1:1 ratio. While the predominant path￾way for clearance of NT-proBNP is by renal excretion, BNP 
appears to have a multiple clearance pathways including NP 
clearance receptors in the kidney and peripheral tissues as 
well as degradation by plasma neutral endopeptidase (vascu￾lature), meprin A (kidneys), and neprilysin (brain) [25-27]. 
Thus, BNP levels are less affected by renal dysfunction 
alone than are levels of NT-proBNP [9, 28]. However levels 
of both peptides can be elevated in the setting of chronic 
kidney disease and loss of renal mass and this may give a 
misleading elevation of one or both suggests suggesting car￾diac decompensation. 
METHODS 
 The Pubmed database was searched in 2009 using the 
following terms: “Brain natriuretic peptide [text word] OR 
“Natriuretic Peptide, Brain”[MeSH Term] OR “pro-brain 
natriuretic peptide (1-76)”[MeSH Term] OR “B-type natri￾uretic peptide”[Text Word]. This search gave 5496 refer￾ences and when searched within these terms for primary 
studies that investigated the analysis of these markers for the 
diagnosis, prognosis determination and treatment monitoring 
of HF patients, 242 references were found. This list was fur￾ther reduced to include only studies that specifically tested 
the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of these tests as pri￾mary means for determining diagnosis or prognosis in adult 
HF patients or those that directly compared the two assays 
(108 references, 58 of which were studies that compared the

two assays). The yield was narrowed by excluding direct 
comparison studies that did not include measures of sensitiv￾ity, specificity and area under receiver operator characteristic 
curve and studies on pediatric patients, those with less than 
100 patients and those using obsolete radioimmunoassays for 
BNP or NT-proBNP. 
 We performed the analogous search by using the terms 
BNP and acute coronary syndrome in the PubMed database 
and found 82 articles. Among those articles, we excluded all 
which were not focused or either BNP or NT-proBNP and 
ischemic heart disease, but also on other cardio biomarkers 
and heart failure. This search resulted in 11 articles that were 
focused only on the study of BNP and NT-proBNP in either 
stable angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc￾tion or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WITH 
ACUTE DYSPNEA 
 BNP and NT-proBNP levels are sensitive, specific and 
quantitative markers of HF [12, 17]. In general, more clinical 
data exists for BNP but both markers have been shown to be 
clinically useful in the diagnosis of HF in patients presenting 
with acute dyspnea in emergency departments (ED) and in 
determining the prognosis of HF patients [10, 29]. Testing 
for these markers is recommended by multiple heart failure 
guidelines including those from the European Society of 
Fig. (2). Comparison of the diagnostic categories of BNP and NT-proBNP values as summarized in the clinical studies for the diagnosis of
HF in symptomatic patients.

Cardiology, the American College of Cardiology/American 
Heart Association and the National Academy of Biochemis￾try [30-33]. 
 Using tests for BNP or NT-proBNP improves diagnosis 
of HF in patients presenting with acute dyspnea in the ED as 
demonstrated in several seminal studies (Tables 1 & 2) [12, 
34-41]. The use of optimal cutoff values allows physicians to 
quickly rule out or rule in HF as a cause of patient symp￾toms. 
 Multiple single center studies demonstrated the useful￾ness of BNP as a diagnostic tool in the ED [12, 34-41] and 
this was validated by the Breathing Not Properly (BNP) 
Multinational Study [42]. In this study, BNP was tested in a 
large (N=1586) multicenter, prospective, blinded, and adju￾dicated format, and it demonstrated that utilization of BNP 
testing lead to more accurate diagnoses than ED physician 
judgment based on patient history, physical findings, chest x￾ray, and other laboratory values [42]. In the BNP Multina￾tional Study, the authors determined that the optimal cutoff 
values of 100 pg/mL yielded a sensitivity of 90% and a 
specificity of 76%. A recent meta-analysis of the studies of 
the usefulness of BNP testing determined that testing for 
BNP was useful for improving accurate diagnosis of HF in 
ED patients presenting with acute dyspnea, particularly when 
the symptoms of HF were mild [29]. Multiple studies have 
shown that NT-proBNP is also highly useful in diagnosing 
dyspneic patients in the ED (Table 2) [39, 40]. The ProBNP 
Investigation of Dyspnea in the ED (PRIDE) study (N=600) 
evaluated whether using NT-proBNP assay could enhance 
the accuracy of HF diagnoses in ED patients [43, 44]. NT￾proBNP at cutpoints of >450 pg/mL for patients <50 years of 
age and >900 pg/mL for patients  50 years of age were 
highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acute HF (p 
<0.001). Similar to the findings for BNP, this study con￾cluded that awareness of patient NT-proBNP levels together 
with clinical judgment gave superior results than either 
method alone [43, 44]. Thus both markers appear to exhibit 
equivalent performance in diagnosing symptomatic patients. 
In addition, both BNP and NT-proBNP have been shown to 
be useful in diagnosing HF in symptomatic patients in other 
departments of the hospital and in symptomatic patients pre￾senting to their general practitioners [45-47]. It is important 
to point out that elevation of one or both markers calls for a 
differential diagnosis to be constructed with includes de￾compensated heart failure, acute coronary ischemia, pulmo￾nary embolism, cor pulmonale, sepsis, renal insufficiency, 
and in rare cases recurring arrhythmias. 
 Both tests have been shown to have a positive economic 
impact on the cost of patient care. In the BNP for Acute 
Shortness of Breath EvaLuation (BASEL) Trial, it was 
shown that utilization of BNP testing in the ED decreased 
the total time from initial presentation to initiation of treat￾ment from 90 to 63 minutes. In addition, BNP results de￾creased the rate of admission from 85% to 75% and reduced 
the total costs of treatment in this patient population from 
$7264 to $5310 [48]. The IMPROVE-CHF study showed 
that NT-proBNP also could significantly decrease costs as￾sociated with patient care. Use of NT-proBNP testing re￾duced the duration of time spent in the ED by 21% and the 
rate of readmission by 35%. Medical costs were reduced in 
the patient population analyzed from $6129 to $5180 over 60 
days as a result of including the test in managing patient care 
[49]. 
 NT-proBNP has a longer half-life in vivo than does BNP 
and it has been argued that because of this, it may be a more 
sensitive than BNP. However, several head-to-head compari￾sons have been done to compare BNP and NT-proBNP as￾says, and together these data suggest that they are generally 
equivalent in terms of sensitivity and specificity in the gen￾eral population (Table 3). BNP and NT-proBNP assays vary 
in sensitivity and specificity depending upon the platform 
used, the patient population, and the diagnostic cutpoint 
used, which may all account for some of the heterogeneity in 
the data [50-53]. Three separate meta-analyses of data from 
clinical studies have been done on the body of work directly 
comparing the sensitivity and specificity these two assays for 
diagnosing HF patients [50, 54, 55]. Two of these analyses 
concluded that they are generally equivalent in their sensitiv￾ity in accurately diagnosing HF in symptomatic patients [50, 
54]. Interestingly, one meta-analysis specifically addressed 
the functionality of these tests in different age groups and 
concluded that BNP is superior, particularly in older patients 
[54]. Thus, the longer half-life and higher measurable levels 
of NT-proBNP do not translate to superior sensitivity, and in 
fact BNP may have better accuracy in elderly patients and 
those with chronic kidney disease. Both peptides are ele￾vated modestly in the setting of diastolic HF but not typically 
to the levels achieved in patients with decompensated sys￾tolic HF. 
RELATIVE VALUE OF BNP AND NT-PROBNP IN 
HEART FAILURE PROGNOSIS 
 In addition to their usefulness in diagnosing HF in symp￾tomatic patients, BNP and NT-proBNP are able to provide 
prognostic information and improve admission decisions in

patients with diagnosed HF. In the context of patient care, it 
has been proposed that because of its shorter half-life in vivo, 
BNP may be more useful than NT-proBNP to track im￾provement following therapeutic intervention and in acute 
HF because it is more sensitive to rapid hemodynamic 
changes in response to treatment [56]. Several studies have 
tested the value of each marker in guiding patient care [49, 
57-60]. 
 Measurement of BNP levels has been shown to accu￾rately identify high-risk chronic HF patients. In one study the 
authors found that patients with BNP levels above 350 
pg/mL were five times more likely to die or be readmitted 
for HF if discharged [61]. Patients with levels over 700 
pg/mL had 15 times the risk of death or readmission, which 
occurred in 90% of the patients in the study [61]. The BNP 
assay was able to predict adverse patient outcomes with an 
area under the ROC curve of 0.83. In another study of 325 
ED patients, BNP levels above 480 pg/mL could predict ad￾verse outcomes with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 
88% and area under the ROC curve of 0.87 [62]. BNP assays 
have strong prognostic value in both elderly and diabetic 
patients [63, 64] and may be a stronger predictor in women 
compared to men [65]. 
 NT-proBNP levels also correlate well with patient prog￾nosis. Studies using multiple measurements of NT-proBNP 
in HF patients during treatment suggest that the absence of a 
decrease in levels during hospitalization correlates with mor￾tality or readmission within 6 months of discharge [66-69]. 
In one study, the authors concluded that a reduction of less 
than 30% was predictive of death with area under the ROC 
curve 0.78 [70], while another concluded that using admis￾sion levels of NT-proBNP of >986 pg/mL could predict one￾year mortality with area under the ROC curve 0.76 [71]. 
Schou et al. determined that every time NT-proBNP dou￾bled, the hazard ratio for death increased by 56% and that for 
readmission increased by 19% [72]. A PRIDE substudy 
showed that NT-proBNP was able to give valuable prognos￾tic information in patients with diabetes [73]. 
 Several studies have been done to directly compare the 
prognostic performance of BNP and NT-proBNP. One study 
compared these markers in chronic HF patients and did not 
find significant differences in their accuracy [74] while an￾other found that NT-proBNP had increased prognostic power 
over BNP for all cause mortality in acute decompensated HF 
patients [75]. In accordance with the ability of these markers 
to provide prognostic information in HF patients, multiple 
studies have shown that they both may improve admission 
decisions in HF patients. Direct comparisons of the relative 
value of BNP and NT-proBNP to guide HF patient care have 
not been made. Several studies in CAD patients with no 
overt symptoms of HF suggest similarly that both markers 
provide valuable prognostic information in earlier disease 
states and that NT-proBNP may provide a slight advantage 
[68, 76, 77]. 
RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF BNP AND NT￾PROBNP IN DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS 
 Several factors other than cardiac function affect levels 
of BNP and NT-proBNP including gender, age, BMI, renal 
disease, and certain pulmonary conditions [78-80]. Some of 
these factors can influence the accuracy of these assays for 
determining diagnosis and prognosis in HF patients. Levels

Utility of BNP and NT-proBNP Open Heart Failure Journal, 2009, Volume 2 11
of both BNP and NT-proBNP are elevated in certain types of 
pulmonary disease such as cor pulmonale, lung cancer, and 
pulmonary embolism [81-83]. Baseline levels of both BNP 
and NT-proBNP are lower in obese patients in normal pa￾tients and in those with heart failure [84-87]. This relation￾ship appears to be independent of left ventricular function 
and hemodynamics. The mechanism by which levels of BNP 
and NT-proBNP are decreased in obese patients is poorly 
understood. NPR-C receptors are that bind BNP are ex￾pressed on adipose tissue. However the observation that both 
BNP and NT-proBNP are decreased in obese patients sug￾gests that rather than enhanced clearance via NPR-C recep￾tors, reduced production of BNP/NT-proBNP is responsible 
for the decreased levels observed in overweight patients [88]. 
In one study NT-proBNP levels fell below optimal cutoff 
values in 15% of obese patients with HF while BNP levels 
were falsely negative in 20% of obese patients, suggesting 
that NT-proBNP levels may be slightly less affected by BMI 
than BNP [89]. However it is clear that for both markers, 
BMI must be taken into account when interpreting results, 
particularly if levels are close to indicated cutoff values [9]. 
Race and gender may influence levels but do not negatively 
impact the usefulness of either marker in diagnosing HF in 
dyspneic subjects [79,80]. 
 BNP is more effective than NT-proBNP as an independ￾ent marker for HF in elderly patients, particularly in those 
with renal disease (9, 10, 74). The Breathing Not Properly 
study showed a correlation between eGFR and BNP in pa￾tients with and without HF. Thus, patients with chronic kid￾ney disease (CKD) do have elevated levels of BNP. How￾ever, if the cutpoint for BNP is increased by 200 pg/mL, an 
acceptable area under the curve of 0.80 exists for BNP as a 
marker for HF in CKD patients [28]. Elevation of NT￾proBNP in contrast is much more accentuated in elderly pa￾tients and in those with renal disease in part because it is 
solely cleared by the kidneys. This elevation of NT-proBNP 
is so dramatic that the values may give false positives, and 
thus different cutoff values must be used [9, 31, 32, 90]. In a 
PRIDE substudy, the authors found that using a cutpoint of 
1200 pg/mL for patients with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 
gave an acceptable AUC of 0.88, with sensitivity of 89% and 
a specificity of 72% [90]. This is one of the main differences 
that have been found between the two assays and may be a 
significant advantage of the BNP assay for diagnostic pur￾poses because HF is most prevalent in elderly patients [91-
94]. In contrast, several studies have also shown that there is 
no difference in the correlation of BNP and NT-proBNP and 
the prognostic utility of these markers in patients with renal 
disease [95, 96]. 
 In conclusion, both tests can accurately diagnose HF in 
elderly patients or in those with renal disease. However, a 
simpler diagnostic algorithm is associated with BNP results 
than NT-proBNP results for diagnostic purposes, which must 
take age and renal dysfunction into consideration when de￾termining cutoff values. 
SCREENING ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS AT RISK 
FOR LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION 
 Several studies have tested the usefulness of BNP or NT￾proBNP in screening asymptomatic populations for heart 
failure. BNP and NT-proBNP are suboptimal for identifying 
asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction in the general population 
[97-100]. In a population with low prevalence of heart fail￾ure, low levels of BNP or NT-proBNP may be able to rule 
out heart failure, but high values are not specific enough to 
rule in heart failure [97]. Although not useful for screening 
the general population, BNP and NT-proBNP tests may be 
beneficial for screening at risk populations for significant 
cardiac impairment for heart failure [101-103]. 
 In patients at high risk for heart failure, BNP testing was 
able to identify patients with underlying cardiac dysfunction 
[101]. Heidenreich et al. showed that it is economically fea￾sible to use a BNP cutoff value of 24 pg/mL to determine 
which patients to screen further using other, more expensive 
methods such as echocardiography [104]. Using this cutoff 
significantly decreased the costs of diagnosing patients with 
suspected cardiac dysfunction. In another study, BNP was 
used to test patients over the age of 65 and a group with a 
high number of cardiac risk factors [100]. The authors found 
that BNP was effective at screening for HF patients with area 
under the ROC curve of 0.83-0.88 for the 65 years of older 
group and 0.83-0.85 in the cohort with a high number of risk 
factors. 
 NT-proBNP is also useful in ruling out HF in primary 
care patients with suspected HF [105]. Omland et al. showed 
that elevated BNP levels were associated with increased risk 
of HF in patients with stable coronary artery disease, while 
NT-proBNP was associated with increased risk of heart fail￾ure as well as cardiovascular death and stroke [76]. More 
comparison studies with current automated BNP and NT￾proBNP assays are needed to determine their relative useful￾ness in this context. 
MONITORING AND GUIDING HEART FAILURE 
MANAGEMENT 
 BNP and NT-proBNP may also be valuable in guiding 
therapeutic treatment for HF [9, 34, 106]. As discussed, BNP 
may be more sensitive to hemodynamic changes in vivo [19, 
56]. More research needs to be done to understand whether 
this impacts the relative effectiveness of BNP to monitor 
changes in patient prognosis following therapeutic interven￾tion. For example, measurement of BNP may more accu￾rately reflect recent changes in the production of BNP. Al￾ternatively it could be overly sensitive in patients with wide 
swings in filling pressures. It has been shown that the disease 
modifying therapies in heart failure that reduce hospitaliza￾tion and mortality also reduce natriuretic peptide levels 
chronically over time; these include: angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta￾blockers, aldosterone-receptor antagonists, and biventricular 
pacing [107-110]. Thus, the concept that natriuretic peptide 
levels, analogous to glycohemoglobin in diabetes manage￾ment, could be a treatment target for office physicians is 
worthy of randomized trials.

Regimens (STARS-BNP) clinical trial showed that monitor￾ing patient BNP levels can augment proper titration of cer￾tain drug therapies to improve patient outcomes [111]. This 
study included 220 patients in the NYHA function class II￾III. Only 24% patients who received BNP guided therapy 
died or were readmitted to the hospital during a 15-month 
period compared to 52% of patients that underwent unguided 
therapy. In the same study, it was found that event-free sur-

12 Open Heart Failure Journal, 2009, Volume 2 McCullough and Neyou 
vival was 84.3% in the BNP-guided group vs. 73.3% in the 
unguided group. In addition, HF related hospitalization 
dropped from 44% to 20% as a result of BNP-guided thera￾peutic modifications. 
 In a single-center trial of 73 patients with HF and ejec￾tion fraction < 40%, Inomata et al. randomized patients to a 
BNP-guided strategy to a target BNP < 200 pg/mL versus 
usual care. The combined endpoint death or hospitalization 
occurred in 22% vs. 55%, p = 0.037 over 25 months [112]. 
The Strategies for Tailoring Advance Heart Failure Regi￾mens in the outpatient setting: BNP vs the clinical conges￾tion score (STARBRITE) clinical trial pilot study assessed 
130 patients with more advanced HF (NYHA class III-IV) 
[113]. In contrast to the STARS study, the pilot study found 
no significant change in the endpoint of readmission or death 
between patients that received BNP guided or unguided ther￾apy. Thus, further research is needed to understand whether 
BNP guided therapy is advisable in patients with more pro￾gressive disease. 
 A randomized trial by Troughton et al. evaluated the role 
of NT-proBNP in guiding outpatient therapeutic intervention 
in class 2-4 HF patients with an ejection fraction < 40% 
[106]. The percent of patients that experienced a cardiovas￾cular event within 6 months was 27% in the NT-proBNP 
guided group vs. 53% in the cohort that lacked NT-proBNP 
monitoring. Thus, NT-proBNP guided therapy also posi￾tively impacts patient outcome. Several large clinical trials, 
the BATTLESCARRED study, the PROTECT study and the 
TIME-CHF study are being undertaken to understand how 
NT-proBNP guided therapy impacts mortality and hospital 
admission rates in HF patients [114-116]. Head-to-head 
comparisons of current BNP and NT-proBNP for guiding 
patient therapy would be highly useful in the future. 
USEFULNESS OF CURRENT BNP AND NT-PROBNP 
ASSAYS IN PATIENTS RECEIVING NESIRITIDE 
THERAPY 
 Recombinant BNP itself (nesiritide or Natricor) is used 
therapeutically in HF patient to ameliorate acute symptoms 
such as dyspnea and reduced cardiac output [117,118]. 
Treatment with these recombinant forms of BNP results in 
an inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and aldosterone 
release, which promotes diuretic and vasodilatory effects. 
Endogenous BNP and NT-proBNP levels have been success￾fully measured in patients following treatment with nesiritide 
(recombinant hBNP) [119]. It has been shown that NT￾proBNP does not respond dynamically over the course of a 
nesiritide infusion, probably because of its longer half-life 
[119]. Nesiritide has an extremely short half-life of 18 min￾utes [118]. Thus, although it has been argued that NT￾proBNP may be advantageous because nesiritide may ob￾scure BNP levels, it is unlikely due to the half-life of the 
treatment. Measurement of BNP levels as soon as 2 hours 
after treatment should largely measure endogenously pro￾duced BNP; however, this needs to be tested. This represents 
an area where further study is needed to understand the rela￾tive usefulness of these assays in this cohort of HF patients. 
BNP AND NT-PROBNP ASSAYS IN ACUTE CORO￾NARY SYNDROMES 
 Measurement of circulating natriuretic peptides, BNP and 
NT-proBNP has found a secure place in the diagnosis, prog￾nosis, and management of patients with heart failure. The 
natriuretic peptides have also been evaluated in the setting of 
acute coronary syndromes (ACS), primarily on the initial or 
baseline blood sample and have been found to be prognostic 
for in-hospital and short-term (6 month, 1 year) outcomes. 
The most recent ACC/AHA guidelines for the management 
of non-ST segment elevation ACS cite the use of natriuretic 
peptide management as a Class IIb indication: “Measure￾ment of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or NT-pro-BNP 
may be considered to supplement assessment of global risk 
in patients with suspected ACS. (Level of Evidence: B)” 
[129]. 
 In the setting of stable angina, Omland et al. [130] 
showed that in patients with angiographically documented 
stable coronary artery disease, plasma BNP level was inde￾pendently related to long-term survival. In their study, BNP 
level> 87pg/ml (> 80th percentile) was associated with a 
survival rate of a little bit lower that 80% at 8 years compare 
to 90% at 8 years for patients with BNP < 87pg/ml. Richards 
et al. in a review [131], compared BNP and NT-proBNP in 
stable ischemic heart disease and concluded that, in this 
population, both natriuretic peptides correlated closely 
(r=0.9, p<0.001), were powerful indicators of left ventricular 
function and independent predictors of clinical outcomes. 
Both peptides were similarly and independently influenced 
by gender, age, renal function and had the same performance 
in detecting left ventricular dysfunction. 
 In unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myo￾cardial infarction, BNP and NT-proBNP levels have been 
shown to have similar prognostic value. Cameron et al. 
compared both peptides in emergency department in patients 
presenting with suspected ACS [132]. Despite the level of 
NT-proBNP being quantitatively higher than BNP, they were 
closely correlated (r=0.89, p<0.0001) across subgroups of 
patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyper￾cholesterolemia, diabetes, all of which can influence vascular 
function and potentially left ventricular wall tension. The 
higher level of NT-pro BNP (median of 185 ng/ml compared 
to 15 ng/ml for BNP) might be explained by its prolonged 
half-life and greater reliance on glomerular filtration function 
for elimination. 
 De Lemos et al. studied the value of BNP in patients with 
unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial 
infarction and showed that a single measurement of BNP 
obtained within 40 hours of the onset of ischemic symptoms 
can be used for risk stratification in ACS. In the same study, 
it was shown that BNP can be elevated, even in the absence 
of myocardial infarction [133]. Patient’s exceeding the 
threshold of 80 pg/ml, approximating the level of neurohor￾monal activation in heart failure (100 pg/ml), had an in￾creased risk of 10-month mortality (OR = 5.8) compared to 
patients with BNP < 80 pg/ml [133]. Other authors found the 
same threshold as useful to identify patients at risk for heart 
failure and death at 6 months after ACS [134]. 
 BNP itself also adds incremental prognostic information 
to other biomarkers including troponin I and CRP in patients 
with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Sa￾batine in a review showed that patients with one, two or 
three elevated biomarkers had respectively 2.1, 3.1 and 3.7 
fold increases in the risk of death, myocardial infarction, and 
congestive heart failure at 6 months [135]. 

Utility of BNP and NT-proBNP Open Heart Failure Journal, 2009, Volume 2 13
 NT-proBNP has also been assessed in non-ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina and has 
been found to improve early risk stratification. NT –pro BNP 
can be elevated in patients with normal troponin considered 
at low risk, allowing discrimination of patients at higher risk 
in this population. The NT-proBNP level range obtained on 
admission associated with risk of death in ACS is between 
400 and 1000 pg/ml [136-139]. Weber et al. showed that a 
level > 474 pg/ml on admission adds incremental prognostic 
value in patients admitted for ACS without an elevation in 
troponin [136]. 
 In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, Mega et 
al. demonstrated that a BNP level of more than 80 pg/ml at 
initial presentation identified patients at higher risk of death 
(seven fold higher) [139]. In the same study, increased con￾centration of BNP at initial presentation of patients with ST￾segment elevation myocardial infarction was associated with 
impaired reperfusion and fibrinolysis [140]. In ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction patients, BNP level has been 
associated with underlying severity of coronary artery dis￾ease and degree of ischemic myocardium. Palazzuoli et al. 
studied 88 patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocar￾dial infarction and preserved ejection fraction, and found that 
BNP levels were significantly higher in patients with three￾vessel disease compared to patients with two or one vessel 
disease. Patients with left anterior descending artery stenosis 
had a higher BNP levels compared to patients with stenoses 
in other vessels [140]. This concept of the association be￾tween BNP and ischemia related increased in wall tension is 
supported by studies showing that there is an increase in 
BNP level after exercise thallium stress testing with signifi￾cant ischemia and after transient ischemia induced by PCI 
[141]. 
 The prognostic significance of large increase in BNP 
level has not been thoughroughly studied in the literature. In 
most of the studies, the cut point of BNP level associated 
with worse prognosis is 80ng/ml. 
 In a retrospective study done on 91 patients admitted 
with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, with BNP 
levels obtained within 24 hours of the patients admission, 
markedly elevated BNP levels (median, 25th percentile and 
75th percentile of the BNP value were 366, 142 and 1011 
pg/ml, respectively) predicted LAD and multivessel disease, 
reduced ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, and hemo￾dynamic compromise including cardiogenic shock and the 
need for intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation early during 
hospitalization. In the same study, despite prompt angiogra￾phy and primary PCI, substantial elevations of BNP was a 
prognostic marker of in-hospital mortality due to cardiovas￾cular causes after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc￾tion. These data suggest that, BNP level might predict not 
only the infarct size but also may portend cardiogenic shock 
in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 
[142]. 
 Overall, BNP and NT-proBNP have a comparable prog￾nostic value in stable angina, unstable angina, non-ST￾segment elevation myocardial infarction and ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction. The threshold value of BNP 
is lower than NT-proBNP most likely secondary to the size 
of the molecule, half-life and mode of elimination, which is 
different. Early neurohormonal activation in myocardial 
ischemia secondary to wall tension, or temporary or perma￾nent left ventricular dysfunction secondary to ischemia, 
might explain why both peptides are elevated in ACS. 
Whether measurements one or both peptides on admission in 
patients with ACS, including patients considered otherwise 
at low risk without elevations of troponin, to assist in man￾agement decisions remains to be determined. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 Testing for BNP or NT-proBNP has a significant impact 
on patient care and outcome in high-risk groups and in pa￾tients with suspected HF. The development of assays on 
automated instruments to test for these markers is a valuable 
tool for physicians and it is estimated that 70% of hospitals 
now have the capability to test for these markers [9]. Accu￾rate diagnosis of HF and/or the ability to rule out suspected 
HF requires the use of BNP/NT-proBNP markers and clini￾cal expertise, which together have been shown to greatly 
improve the accuracy of diagnosis in suspected HF patients. 
Prompt and appropriate use of therapeutic interventions can 
have a positive impact on patient quality of life and accurate 
markers of HF such as BNP and NT-proBNP are valuable 
for diagnosis and monitoring of HF patients in the ED and in 
high-risk populations. 
 In general, both markers are sensitive and specific mark￾ers of HF, which provide valuable prognostic information, 
improve patient care, and may be used to screen high-risk 
populations. BNP assays have the advantage of utilizing a 
single cutoff value for any age group. Thus, simpler, teach￾able algorithms are possible with BNP and not NT-proBNP. 
NT-proBNP levels are more significantly affected in elderly 
patients or in those with renal dysfunction, and thus, have 
lesser utility. In addition, a recent meta-analysis suggests that 
even with modified cutoff values BNP may be a superior 
diagnostic tool in elderly patients (44). In addition, although 
both markers have been shown to improve patient outcomes 
when used to guide admission decisions and/or therapy, 
head-to-head comparisons should be done to directly com￾pare the usefulness of these assays in the longitudinal man￾agement of heart failure. 
 Measurement of natriuretic peptides in the setting of 
ACS identifies patients at high risk for short-term outcomes 
in including the development of HF, rehospitalization, and 
death. This application is germane to patients with unstable 
angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, 
and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The eleva￾tion of BNP and NT-proBNP appears to reflect the area of 
ischemic myocardium at risk, severity of coronary disease, 
and impending LV dysfunction. 
 It should be noted that levels of both peptides are found 
to be lower in normals and in those with HF among the 
obese. This may be related to enhanced clearance of the pep￾tides. Malavazos and colleagues have described a relation￾ship between epicardial fat and increased levels of NT￾proBNP that suggest either myocardial triglyceride content 
or the paracrine effect of adipokines may be related to in￾creased wall tension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and pro￾duction of natriuretic peptides [143]. Clearly more research 
is needed in this area. 
 Finally, the use of natriuretic peptides can be seen as a 
major advance in the diagnosis, prognosis, screening, and

management of CVD. Future studies that use these markers 
in treatment pathways to improve outcomes are anticipated.
