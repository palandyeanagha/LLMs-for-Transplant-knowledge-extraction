Abstract
Malignancy is a common complication after renal transplantation. However, limited data are 
available on post-transplant malignancy in living kidney transplantation. Therefore, we made a 
plan to evaluate the incidence and types of malignancies, association with the main risk factors 
and patient survival in a large population of living kidney transplantation. We conducted a large 
retrospective multicenter study on 12525 renal recipients, accounting for up to 59% of all 
kidney transplantation in Iran during 22 years follow up period. All information was collected 
from observation of individual notes or computerized records for transplant patients. Two 
hundred and sixty-six biopsy-proven malignancies were collected from 16 Transplant Centers 
in Iran; 26 different type of malignancy categorized in 5 groups were detected. The mean age 
of patients was 46.2±12.9 years, mean age at tumor diagnosis was 50.8±13.2 years and average 
time between transplantation and detection of malignancy was 50.0±48.4 months. Overall 
tumor incidence in recipients was 2%. Kaposis’ sarcoma was the most common type of tumor. 
The overall mean survival time was 117.1 months (95% CI: 104.9-129.3). In multivariate 
analysis, the only independent risk factor associated with mortality was type of malignancy. 
This study revealed the lowest malignancy incidence in living unrelated kidney transplantation.
Key words: malignancy, kidney transplantation, incidence.

INTRODUCTION
Kidney transplantation is generally accepted as 
the best treatment for patients with end stage renal 
disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy 
which improves both the quality of life and life span 
of patients (1-5). Although the new and potent im￾munosuppressive agents have successfully reduced 
the risk of rejection after kidney transplantation; 
however, cardiovascular disease, infectious and neo￾plastic complications are increasing (3, 6). Cancer is 
the second cause of death in renal transplant recipi￾ents (2) and it is expected that the mortality due to 
cancer will be moved to become the first cause of 
death within the next two decades (7). The overall 
reported post-transplant malignancy incidence varies 
from 2% to 31%; however, it happen in a percentage 
as high as 34-50% among renal transplant recipients 
(RTRs) followed for more than 20 years (7). Many 
studies have demonstrated an increased risk of cancer 
among RTRs when compared with an age- and gen￾der-matched general population or in patients un￾dergoing dialysis (1-4). In general, the risk of devel￾oping malignancy in organ transplants is 3-4 times 
greater than general population and the risk of certain 
types of cancer is as high as 20-500 folds (3, 8, 9).
The majority of the literature on malignancy in 
kidney transplantation is drawn from deceased 
transplants and limited data are available on 
post-transplant malignancy in living kidney trans￾plantation, especially living unrelated renal trans￾plantation (LURT). Although Kasiske et al (2004) (10)
reported the largest study (n = 35765) about the inci￾dence rates of malignancies among first-time kidney 
recipients, however, living donor transplantation only 
accounted 24% all of them (i.e., n=8584). Furthermore, 
the other huge studies (11-16) only focused on de￾ceased kidney transplantation. 
Therefore, we made a plan to evaluate the prev￾alence, incidence, characteristics, potential predictors 
of death, relationship to immunosuppressive drugs, 
common cancers, current opinions on management, 
patient survival and the association with the main risk 
factors of prognosis of malignancy following renal 
transplantation, particularly in a large population of 
LURT (10960 cases out of all 12525 RTRs) (17, 18).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Recipient population
We conducted a large retrospective multicenter 
study on 12525 RTRs, accounting for up to 59% of all 
kidney transplantation in Iran (19), to determine the 
incidence and types of malignancies occurring after 
renal transplantation and their impact on patient and 
graft survival between Oct 1984 and Dec 2008. The 
majority of our patients received a kidney from a liv￾ing unrelated donor (87.5%), following 9.8% living 
related and 2.7% deceased donor transplantation. The 
mean age of RTRs was 37.7±15.2 years (range: 3 to 86 
years), 7885 (63%) male and 4640 (37%) female. The 
duration of study was 24 years and patients were 
followed-up until graft loss, patient death or the date 
of last visit subsequently 266 biopsy-proven malig￾nancies were collected from 16 Transplant Centers in 
Iran. The patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. 
This study was approved by the local Ethics Com￾mittee of Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.
Patients with other organ transplants, history of 
previous malignancy and transplantation from de￾ceased donors with past history of malignancy were 
excluded. 
Definition
1- The definition of acute rejection was based on 
the conventional pathologic criteria, Banff classifica￾tion, and clinical criteria of the reporting centers. 
2- Treatment modalities were considered ac￾cording to the type of cancer, staging of disease, and 
involved organs. Management included a combina￾tion of reduction, withdrawal or changing of the im￾munosuppressive agents, chemotherapy, radiothera￾py, hormone therapy and surgical resection.
3- Non Kaposi’s sarcoma tumors (non-KS) in￾cluded SCC (squamouse cell carcinoma), BCC (basal 
cell carcinoma) and melanoma.
4- Tumors of breast, ovary and uterine in female, 
prostate and seminoma in male and renal cell carci￾noma (RCC) and transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of 
bladder in both gender were considered as genitou￾rinary and reproductive system (GU & RS) neo￾plasms.
5- The term of solid tumors was used for all the 
malignancies except for skin tumors, PTLD (post 
transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder) and 
GU & RS cancers.
6- Patients with tumor were categorized into 5 
groups according to their type of neoplasm: Non-KS, 
KS, PTLD, GU & RS tumors and solid tumors.
7- Monoclonal antibody (ATG/ALG) can be re￾quired for induction therapy and for acute ster￾oid-resistant rejection episodes during the first three 
months following kidney transplantation. Induction 
therapy with ATG/ALG was used for highly sensi￾tized patients, those receiving kidneys from deceased 
donors with delayed graft function, patients with 
poorly matching living donors, and patients with the 
second or more transplants. None of the patients took 
OKT3.

Immunosuppression protocols
The immunosuppressive therapy was based on 
cyclosporine/sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF)/azathioprine (AZA) and steroids. Before 2000, 
patients received dual maintenance immunosuppres￾sion with prednisone and cyclosporine/AZA or triple 
therapy with cyclosporine, prednisone, and AZA. 
Afterwards, the majority of patients received cyclo￾sporine, prednisone, and MMF as well (20).
STATISTICS
Data were analyzed with SPSS version 17.0. 
Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± 
standard deviation, whereas qualitative variables 
were shown as number and percentage. Continuous 
data were compared by Student’s t-test, and catego￾rized data were analyzed using the Chi-square or 
Fisher’s exact test.
Cancer-free patient survival rate was defined as 
the time from diagnosis of the tumor to death. The 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate actuarial 
survival curves, and univariate comparison between 
groups was carried out by using the log-rank test. Cox 
proportional hazards survival regression model was 
used to evaluate the effect of risk factors on patient 
survivals. The significance level was set at P <0.05.

ter diagnosis of cancer for a median follow up time of 
22 months (min 1 month and max 168 months). The 
male/female ratio was 2.1:1. The mean age of patients 
was 46.2±12.9 years (range 12-72 years); on average, 
men were older than women (47.1±13 years vs. 
44.75±12.4 years; p=0.1). In addition, t-test analysis 
revealed that the risk of malignancy increased with 
age compared to those with no cancer (46.2±12.9 years 
vs 37.7±15.2 years, p<0.001). Mean age at tumor di￾agnosis was 50.8±13.2 years (range 15.5-82 years), and 
the average time between transplantation and detec￾tion of malignancy was 50.0±48.4 months (median 36, 
range 1-284 months). The lowest and highest median 
times to development of cancer were observed in KS 
and GU & RS malignancy (13 months, range 2-143 
months vs 72 months, 8-240 months), respectively 
(table 2).

Tumor incidence
Overall, tumor incidence of cancer in renal 
transplants was 2% and cumulative incidences of any 
detected malignancy after kidney transplantation 
during first 3 years are summarized in table 3. PTLD 
was the most common type of malignancy in age be￾low 30 years as well as age between 30-50 years (18 
cases; 54.5% and 36 cases; 30%, respectively). How￾ever, KS was the most common type of tumor (26 pa￾tients; 24.8%) in above 50 years old patients. The ma￾jority of patients with KS had limited skin and/or 
mucosal disease (87% of recipients), while 13% of 
them had visceral involvement. The skin cancer (141 
recipients; 52.9%) was the most frequently observed 
malignancy after renal transplantation including KS, 
SCC, BCC and melanoma, followed by PTLD (72 cas￾es; 27%); whereas GU & RS tumors (25 cases; 9.4%) 
was the most common malignancy among the other 
visceral tumors. The most frequent tumor in men and 
women was KS (53 patients; 61.9% and 31 cases; 
38.1%, respectively), which had low mortality (n=7; 
11.1% and n=5; 15.6%, respectively) (table 4).
RCC was seen in 6 patients of which 2 (33.3%) 
suffered from native RCC. We also observed a case of 
breast cancer in a male patient.
AZA-based regimens was used in approximately 
one third of recipients (4771 cases; 38.1%), while the 
rest was on MMF-based therapy (7736 patients; 
61.9%). In addition, about one third of female gender 
(1703 cases; 35.7%) was treated with AZA. In this 
study, the incidence of cancer in men was signifi￾cantly greater than in women (67.8% vs 32.2%, 
p=0.009) and recipients who were on AZA-based 
regimens were significantly associated with higher 
rate of cancer in comparison with those who were on 
MMF-based immunosuppression (61.3% vs 38.7%, 
p<0.001). The most common malignancy with 
AZA-based protocol was PTLD, while KS was the 
most frequently observed tumor in MMF-based reg￾imens (table 1). On the other hand, AZA-based im￾munosuppression was associated with a higher risk 
for development of PTLD when compared to MMF 
therapy (45.3% vs 54.7%, p=0.001). 
Tumors developed in 36 (13.5%) of patients 
treated with ALG/ATG (table 1). In this study, the 
risk of malignancy was greatest in patients with age 
older than 30 (222 cases, 87.1%) (p= 0.007). However, 
no significant association was observed between 
cancer and patients’ gender [177 male (2.2%) vs 84 
female (1.8%), p=0.1]. 
Treatment modalities
Patients were treated with 2 strategies, first of all, 
standard therapy for malignancy and the second, 
immunosuppressive modality. Combined surgery, 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 22.95 percent; 
combined surgery and chemotherapy in 10.7 percent; 
combined surgery and radiotherapy in 3.8 percent; 
combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy among 4.6 
percent of patients were performed. In addition, sin￾gle standard treatment with surgery, chemotherapy 
or radiotherapy was done among 26.7 percent, 29 
percent, and 2.3 percent respectively.
Though withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitor and 
conversion to sirolimus should be considered early 
after the development of cancer; however, it had no 
significant benefits when compared to reduction of 
immunosuppressive therapy (p=1). However, reduc￾tion of immunosuppressive agents in patients with 
tumor was associated with lower rate of graft loss 
when compared to the withdrawal of immunosup￾pression (96.7% vs 73.9%, p<0.001). In addition, renal 
function was preserved when immunosuppression 
was reduced instead of withdrawn in recipients with 
cancer (96.7% vs 73.9%, p<0.001).

Graft function
Overall death-censored graft loss (graft failure 
without death) was seen in 11.4% individuals; on the 
other hand, 50 cases died with a functioning graft. 
Thus, the main cause of graft loss in our recipients 
was patient death. 
Mortality rate
At the end of the study, 25% (67) of RTRs died 
following development of cancer. A higher rate of 
mortality was seen within the first year after tumor 
diagnosis (54 cases, 20.5%), while only 4.5% of mor￾tality was observed during the next 5 years. PTLD 
was the most common cause of death in both genders 
(20 male and 8 female) and in all age groups (3 in 
group ≤30 years, 17 in group 31-50 years and 7 in 
group >50 years).
Patient Survival Data
In the current study, overall cumulative patient 
survival was 74.6% at 14 years after tumor diagnosis 
and table 5 summarizes the first 5 year cancer free 
survival rates in 5 groups. In addition, cumulative 
survival curves are plotted separately for all groups in 
figure 1. The overall mean survival time was 117.1 
months (95% CI: 104.9-129.2) and for all categorized 
cancer groups, data are shown in table 6. The best 
overall mean survival rates after treatment of malig￾nancy were observed in patients with SCC or BCC 
(non-KS group) which was 164.8 months (95% CI: 
158.7-170.9), and the worst prognosis was associated 
with sub-group of solid tumor (mean 25.5 months; 
95% CI: 12.7-38.2).
In univariate analysis, the significant risk factors 
for death included poor graft function (p<0.001), 
treatment with AZA (P=0.004), acute rejection episode 
after transplantation (P=0.008), withdrawal of im￾munosuppressive drugs (p<0.001), non skin tumors 
(p<0.001), distant metastasis (P<0.001), no response to 
treatment (p<0.001), and induction therapy with 
ATG/ALG (p=0.02). 
In multivariate analysis, the only independent 
risk factor associated with mortality was type of ma￾lignancy (table 7).

DISSCUSION
With the advent of management for infectious 
and cardiovascular complications after renal trans￾plantation, it is probable that malignancy among 
RTRs may become an increasingly essential cause of 
mortality in the future (18). To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the largest series reporting the re￾sults of post-transplant malignancy in LURT patients.
According to some reports, incidence of 
post-transplant cancer ranges from 2% to 31% (de￾pending on the follow-up period, tumor kind and 
registry records) and adds up to 34–50% (6). However, 
in this study the overall tumor incidence in RTRs was 
2% which is less than other studies, even from Asian 
reports (1, 4, 6, 7, 14, 21-24). On the other hand, the 
relative risk for cancer in post-transplant recipients is 
different among the various cancers. The reasons for 
these differences are given below:
1- The available studies are limited, because the 
main information on cancer in the renal transplanted 
patients is adopted from the Cincinnati Transplant 
Tumor Registry, Collaborative Transplant Study, and 
the Australian and New Zealand Transplant Registry 
(3), which are in a limited location with a relative 
homogeneity in medical care, type of donor, geo￾graphical location, disease epidemiology, lifestyle, 
diet, cultural and socioeconomic status. For example 

Journal of Cancer 2012, 3
http://www.jcancer.org
253
regional differences can explain reason of higher skin 
cancers rate in Australia and New Zealand versus 
Central Europe (3). 
Also, reporting of cancer to registries is often 
incomplete and probably underestimates the true 
cancer incidence which potentially leads to difference 
in overall cancer incidence. On the other hand, single 
center studies have small sample size therefore are not 
reliable then using data from different registries, with 
different population can help to estimate almost true 
incidence of cancers (25). 
2- Several specific malignancies in transplant re￾cipients have been linked with specific viruses, such 
as Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) which promotes lym￾phomas as well as hepatitis viruses B and C which are 
linked with hepatocellular carcinoma and human 
herpes virus 8 which predisposes to lymphomas and 
Kaposi’s sarcoma. In addition, cervical, penile and 
vulvar cancers are associated with human papilloma￾viruses (25). As we know, distribution of viruses is 
epidemiologically different and so the difference in 
distribution of viruses induced cancers are expected.
3- Published studies show that geographical 
factors have also an impact on different forms of 
post-transplant cancer, since high incidence of gas￾trointestinal tumors in Japan, urinary tract transitional 
cell carcinoma in Taiwan and liver cancer in 
South-East Asia have been reported in kidney trans￾plant recipients (25, 26).
4- Exposure to carcinogens such as total sun ex￾posure and living in a hot climate which are im￾portant risk factors for skin cancers, and difference in 
race as well as genetics can cause difference in skin 
cancer distribution. For example, studies have shown 
that Caucasian RTRs living in Queensland, Australia, 
have the highest global risk of non-melanoma skin 
cancer (NMSC) (25, 27).
5- Samhan et al revealed that cancer after kidney 
transplantation was more frequent in deceased do￾nors (15).
6- Wimmer et al showed time and the intensity 
of immunosuppression augmented the incidence of 
malignancy (3), therefore the races such as African 
who need more immunosuppressive drugs after kid￾ney transplantation are more predisposed to cancer 
(28).
Although in this study following up period was 
not very long, lower incidence of malignancy may be 
due to living donors, strict screening, exact immuno￾suppressive monitoring, lower doses of immunosup￾pression used in RTRs from living donors, race and 
lifestyle differences which need further investigation. 
Skin cancer
In contrast to Moosa and Gralla study which be￾lieves Middle East RTRs rarely have skin malignan￾cies (29): in this study, the skin cancer was the most 
common form of malignancy among RTRs, a finding 
that is concordant with other reports (18), but the 
most common type of skin cancer in our recipients 
was different from Western countries and similar to 
Mediterranean, Jewish, Arabic, Caribbean, or African 
reports which KS is the most frequently observed 
tumor among our RTRs (3, 7, 10, 20).
SCC and BCC have better prognosis than KS. On 
the other hand, race and geographic location are the 
important factors for incidence of KS; therefore, it 
seems that race and geographic location may be 
prognostic factors in post-transplant malignancy. 
In post-transplant skin cancer, immunosuppres￾sive agents such as azathioprine or cyclosporine not 
only can directly potentiate damaging effects of UV 
radiation on skin, but also can augment reduction of 
local and systemic immune responses during sun 
exposure. Furthermore, azathioprine sensitizes DNA 
to UVA radiation, reducing the minimal erythema 
dose in skin cells of treated patients (30, 31). In one 
study, a significant association between current use of 
azathioprine and cutaneous SCC was described (27, 
32)
PTLD
In adults, PTLD is the second most common 
cancer and encompasses up to 12% of post-transplant 
cancers (18). In children with renal transplant, PTLD 
is the most common cancer which involves up to 50% 
of post-transplant cancers (18). It was 4-fold higher in 
children than adults (33). The frequency of PTLD 
varies according to the type of organ transplanted, 
age of recipients (i.e., children versus adults), and the 
immunosuppressive regimen (33). Furthermore, re￾cipients developing PTLD after organ transplantation 
have a poor prognosis (25). In the current study, in￾cidence of PTLD was 0.5% and majority of them are 
presented in the first year (6.4%), and survival rate is 
lower especially in the first years (Fig 1).
GU & RS tumors
According to Dantal study (2007) (25) about GU 
& RS cancer in RTRs the most common GU & RS tu￾mors is transitional cell carcinoma and majority of 
them were diagnosed at early stage and capable of 
treatment (25, 34). Moreover, Besarani et al. (2006) (34)
reported the incidence of urological tumors in the 
Oxford Transplant Centre among 2100 RTRs within 3 
decades and RCC accounted for the most common 
urological malignancies in these individuals with an 

Journal of Cancer 2012, 3
http://www.jcancer.org
254
incidence of 4.6%. In our study, the majority of GU & 
RS cancers were late onset with low survival rate and 
they presented more in middle age and in male gen￾der. Therefore, screening schedules are very helpful 
for early detection and it is reasonable that all patients 
after transplantation must be monitored for TCC 
bladder and for both native and transplanted kidney 
with a regular ultrasonography. 
In this study, we found a lower prevalence of 
breast cancers (male/female: 1/2) in our recipients. 
However, there is no consensus whether female renal 
transplant patients rarely got breast cancer. Marcen et 
al (35) believe prostate cancer in male and breast 
cancer in female gender which are one of the most 
common neoplasias in general population, are not (or 
only slightly) increased among transplant recipients. 
Nevertheless, Kasiske et al (10) reported a 2-fold in￾crease in breast cancer risk among RTRs compared to the 
general population (10). Interestingly, breast cancer is 
known to be a hormonally dependent carcinoma. 
Many studies have revealed androgen receptor to be 
often co-expressed with estrogen receptor and pro￾gesterone receptor in breast tumors (36). 
The main contributing factors of malignancy in 
kidney transplant patients:
Solid tumors
We found that the worst prognosis was observed 
in solid tumors patients with high rate of refractori￾ness to treatment and elevated recurrence rate. 
Immunosuppression
One of the most important risk factors for de￾veloping malignancies is receiving immunosuppres￾sive agents (25), they can affect host defense and sus￾ceptible to malignancy (18). Conversely, some im￾munosuppressive drugs for instance sirolimus has 
dual effect on immunosuppression and antitumor 
effect experimentally and clinically. Published studies 
have revealed a lesser incidence of new (de novo) 
malignancies in RTRs whose immunosuppression is 
mTOR inhibitors than CNIs. One of the important 
advantage in mTOR inhibitors usage may be the pro￾tection of allograft from immunological rejection, 
while simultaneously preventing from cancer in 
high-risk group (21).
Although, while considering patient survival 
until now, any meticulous immunosuppressive pro￾tocol has not been confirmed to be better over others, 
but it seems AZA and calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) 
have been more linked with post-transplant malig￾nancies (2). In this study, MMF had less negative im￾pact on the incidence of malignancies than AZA. In 
the current study, all types of malignancies were as￾sociated with AZA based protocol except for KS 
which was associated with MMF slightly more than 
AZA based regimen. Data about carcinogenicity of 
MMF are controversial (25). While MMF was diag￾nosed as an anti-neoplastic agent, some clinical trials 
suggested that it was associated with a non-significant 
tendency towards an increased risk of PTLD in RTRs 
(37), but PTLD was significantly associated with AZA 
in our patients. On the other hand, two large studies 
demonstrated that MMF was not linked with ampli￾fication of malignancy (38, 39). Indeed, it seems that 
there is a trend towards a lower risk of malignancy 
with MMF (25, 38).
According to other studies in malignant condi￾tion, we preferred to change calcineurin inhibitor by 
sirolimus. However, it was not available until recent 
years and reduction or withdrawal of immunosup￾pressive drugs was mostly achieved. Nonetheless, 
decrease of immunosuppression had significantly 
better results in terms of response to treatment, pre￾vention of rejection, graft preservation and patient 
survival compared to immunosuppressive discon￾tinuation. Finally, induction of donor-specific toler￾ance might be resolved so many complications from 
long-term immunosuppressive therapies in future 
(40).
Survival
Despite the high incidence of skin cancers in 
transplant recipients, these tumors are usually not 
fatal. Solid organ cancers, although less common, are 
associated with a far worse prognosis in renal trans￾plant recipients (25). The best survival has been ob￾served in SCC and BCC and the worst in 
non-hematologic and non-skin tumors. Patient sur￾vival is lesser in patients who received monoclonal 
antibody induction. Thus if monoclonal antibody in￾duction is indicated, consideration to benefit and 
hazard, in future, is very important.
Although the present results showed no signifi￾cant difference between gender, age, type of immu￾nosuppression and all type of cancers, we found that 
the majority of cancers occurred in the first 5 years 
after transplantation, male gender, patients greater 
than 40 years, individuals received AZA. Thus, these 
groups should be considered for screening protocols. 
LIMITATION
As this study was retrospective and data has 
been collected from previous medical records that 
were completed by several nephrologists without any 
coordination between them, thus all contributing 
factors were not accessible and we have some missing 
data. In addition follow up period was short and we 

Journal of Cancer 2012, 3
http://www.jcancer.org
255
did not follow patients who developed cancer after 
transplant failure.
Unfortunately, we have no document reports 
about all kind of malignancy in non-transplant pop￾ulation; subsequently, comparison of cancer rate in 
transplant patients with the general population was 
not possible.
CONCLUSION
This study revealed the lowest malignancy inci￾dence in living unrelated kidney transplantation and 
KS as the most common malignancy in our RTRs. 
Additionally, immunosuppressive reduction has bet￾ter outcome than withdrawal. Otherwise, use of im￾munosuppressive agents must be balanced between 
the beneficial or hazardous effect of preventing organ 
rejection or increasing the risk of tumor development.
