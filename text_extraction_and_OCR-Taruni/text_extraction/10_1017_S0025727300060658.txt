Towards a History of Infective Endocarditis
ALAIN CONTREPOIS*
Infective endocarditis is a serious heart disease which is sometimes very difficult to
diagnose and treat despite the progress made over the last few decades. The complex
nature of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in this disease is reflected in the
countless number of scientific studies still being done on it.1
At the end of the eighteenth century and during the first half of the nineteenth century,
the anatomo-clinical method facilitated the gradual establishment of correlations between
a lesion discerned during autopsy and symptoms observed in the live patient. It then
became a question of bringing together what were, until then, separate individual
observations. The very term "endocarditis", referring to an individual tissue and an
inflammatory process, goes back to early-nineteenth-century clinicians such as Broussais
and Bouillaud, before the germ theory and the birth of bacteriology.
However, it was very difficult for doctors of that period to define endocarditis in a
simple, unequivocal manner. There was not always a clear relationship between the ideas
which late historians have supposed fed each other; the arguments were confusing,
tortuous, circular, and dead-end. In his discussion of syphilis, Ludwik Fleck correctly
pointed out that disease is a constructed, ever-changing phenomenon which constantly
integrates new information and concepts.2 Thus, the term "endocarditis" continued to be
used for a disease which underwent endless development throughout the nineteenth
century. There was also modification of the aetiological links between anatomical
abnormalities, clinical symptoms and observations during autopsy. The pathology of the
disease was regularly reformulated and its definition varied from period to period and
from country to country. The germ theory and the use of the microscope changed the view
and concept of the disease at the end of the century. But, even if an instrument suddenly
enhances the power of the senses, the knowledge thus acquired needs to be interpreted by
human beings. The fact of being able to "see" minute granulations hitherto invisible is not
enough immediately to transform these granulations into an analytical tool. The
perception of the disease as a relatively coherent whole with aetiological symptoms, led,

nevertheless, to laboratory experiments on diseases.3 At the beginning of the twentieth
century, before the dawning of the first rays of therapeutic hope, a few clinicians tried to
shed light on the somewhat confused knowledge of endocarditis and to surmount the
formidable problem of describing and classifying this complex disease.4
Any attempt to "reconstruct" a history of this disease, therefore, will not be an easy
task, for as Georges Canguilhem remarked, "Before joining up two tracks, you have to
first be sure that they belong to the same path".5 There is, for every researcher, at any
given time, a particular area which he tries to explore and in which he attempts to build a
set of relationships, not only through observation and techniques, but also in keeping with
current practices, values and interpretations.

Autopsies and Symptoms
Abnormalities
At the end of the seventeenth century and during the eighteenth, a new medical outlook
emerged as a result of anatomical observations made during autopsies. Some observers
were struck by the unusual nature of anatomical anomalies of the inner membrane of the
heart, and of the valves in particular. The term "anomaly" is being used deliberately here.
Canguilhem, referring to Lalande's "vocabulaire philosophique", points out that the word
is derived from the Greek word "anomalia" which means inequality or unevenness of a
surface;6 "omalos" in Greek signifies that which is uniform, even or smooth. "Anomaly"
then is derived from "an-omalos", that is, uneven, rough, irregular, much as one would
speak about terrain. The "terrain" in this case, usually smooth, is the inner lining of the
heart as well as the valves. On the other hand, according to I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,
abnormal is a descriptive concept and anomaly a normative one. As far as he is concerned,
"in anatomy, the term abnormality should be used strictly to mean strange or unusual; to
be abnormal is to be different from the vast majority of persons with whom one is
compared."7 The two meanings of the term seem to apply here. A number of symptoms
were described along with these anatomical anomalies, and it is interesting to note the
marked similarity between work carried out in France, Italy and England.
According to Laennec, one of the first descriptions of cardiac pathological alteration
came from Lazare Riviere, professor of Medicine at the University of Montpellier. When
in 1646 he was consulted by a patient who complained of palpitations, Riviere detected
the following symptoms and signs: first, a faint and irregular pulse. A month later, the

patient was suffering from respiratory problems and swollen legs; the patient's condition
progressively worsened; his difficulty in breathing increased and there was no pulse at the
wrist; "when I placed my hand over his heart", Riviere detected a faint, rapid and irregular
palpitation. After the patient died, Riviere performed an autopsy and in the left ventricle
he found some "small round outgrowths resembling the lungs in texture, the largest of
which was about the size of a hazelnut, which blocked the aortic valve". This description
seems to indicate that Riviere had some knowledge of the internal structure of the heart
and that what he observed in this case struck him as peculiar.8
In 1708, the Italian Giovanni Maria Lancisi also wrote of the unusual phenomenon of
lesions inside the heart at the entrance to the aorta observed during autopsy: "I saw some
rough structures on the valves as well as small nodules of flesh". For Lancisi, there was
no doubt that these hard bodies were projections of the fibres and valvular tissues and
were not simply stuck to them.9 In 1715, Raymond Vieussens, professor at Montpellier,
identified certain abnormalities in the aortic mitral valves,10 and in 1749, Jean-Baptiste
Senac also described valvular lesions.11
But, at what stage does an observed abnormality become a disease? Giovanni Battista
Morgagni (1682-1771) identified diseases according to the local distribution of their
symptoms as well as their point of origin. A disease occurs at the organic level. Morgagni
believed that a patho-anatomical examination must constantly refer to the anatomy of the
normal person, obviously, but, at the same time, to clinical experiments as well. In the De
sedibus, he mentioned a post-mortem observation of a large number of outgrowths on the
aortic valves and, in addition to this cardiac abnormality, "adipose ramifications" on the
spleen. It was pointed out that the patient had virulent gonorrhoea but no clear relation was
established with symptoms and anatomical lesions.12 Sandifort illustrated his observation
of these intracardiac abnormalities with the help of extremely eloquent diagrams.'3
Meanwhile, in London, Matthew Baillie (1761-1823) described deformations of the
heart and the aorta. He recognized "rheumatic carditis" and the relationship between
rheumatism and certain heart diseases, confirming this in the second edition of his Morbid
anatomy which appeared in 1797. However, although he discussed "ossification" and
thickening of the heart valves in detail, he believed that inflammation was a rare
occurrence: "I have also seen the valvular apparatus between the auricle and the ventricle,
in a state of inflammation, and covered with a layer of coagulable lymph. This I believe
to be very uncommon."14

The Botany of the Heart
In 1799, Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) devoted his Treatise on the membranes to a
detailed study of general pathological forms which added a new dimension to Morgagni's
anatomical distribution of symptoms, thus passing from localization to tissue
organization.15 It then became evident that there were large families of diseases with the
same major symptoms, which developed in the same way. Bichat was also responsible for
elucidating the notion of tissue inflammation. All serious membrane inflammation was
recognized by the characteristic thickening, loss of transparency, whitish colour, granular
alteration and adhesion of these membranes to adjacent tissue.16 But inflammation which
appears under the same form in all the seriously affected membranes does not attack them
all with the same ease nor does it develop at the same speed: "the following are affected
by descending order of susceptibility: the pleura, the peritoneum, the pericardium, the
vaginal membrane and the arachnoid". The heart, like other organs, is made up of different
types of tissue. Bichat pointed out that a disease could be localized in only one membrane
and one tissue of a hollow organ independently of the rest of the organ. However, although
Bichat referred to the pericardium, he made no mention of the internal lining of the heart
and possible abnormalities. Nevertheless, he described the inner lining of vessels as
forming a continuous surface on the inside of vessels divided into two parts: the first part consists
of the veins, the right auricle, the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery; the second consists of the
pulmonary veins, the left auricle and left ventricle, the aorta and other arteries.17
These two internal surfaces join at the point where the arteries end and the veins begin.
The degree of sensitivity of each type of membrane depends on the type of blood with
which it comes into contact.
While Bichat was carrying out his studies, in 1806, Jean Nicolas Corvisart (1755-1821)
was writing his Essay on organic diseases and lesions of the heart and great vessels.
Corvisart was probably the first person to use a botanic term-"vegetations"-to refer to
the outgrowths observed in the heart and this botanic reference was also extended to the
similarity between these "vegetations" and venereal "cauliflower":
Under the denomination of vegetations, I do not mean to speak of the eminences, or osseous
asperities, but of actual excrescences or soft vegetations, whose nature would be entirely unknown,
did not a perfect resemblance to venereal excrescences, and certain approximations made from a
number of observations, lead us to think that they might be syphilitic. Why then do we hesitate to
believe that the venereal virus from its protean nature cannot attack organs, which seem, by their
situation, to be secure from such attacks?
Thus, according to Corvisart, and as Lancisi seemed to have already imagined in 1707,
budding is the best explanation for the growth of these vegetations.
There had been no real attempt to give a clinical explanation for these cardiac
abnormalities until Corvisart came up with the idea that the syphilitic virus could be the

cause of these unusual anatomical manifestations. Furthermore, he wondered if it would
not be possible to use anti-venereal treatment in cases where a diagnosis could be
established. In one of his many clinical observations, after noting the connection between
the patient's exposure to different weather conditions and swelling of the extremities, he
made no explicit link between rheumatic pain, fever and cardiac lesions. He mentioned the
outer membrane of the heart-the pericardium-and pointed out that the presence of
vegetations could cause narrowing of the orifices and consequently block circulation:
Clinical observation No. 37 of N Corvisart (1806):
A quarry-man, aged thirty-nine years, of a robust constitution, but very intemperate, exposed, by
occupation, to the vicissitudes of heat and cold, suffered, at the age of twenty years, rheumatic pains,
which impaired his health but for a short time.
About the 22d of November, 1800, he was attacked with peripneumony, which was, to appearance,
well cured; after his convalescence, he was, however, harrassed by an obstinate cough and pain in the
right hypochondrium; to these symptoms were soon after joined, hoarseness, vomitings produced by
the violence of the cough, and paroxysms of fever in the evening; in short, swelling of the extremities.
Having left the Hospital Cochin, where he was treated for the peripneumony, he entered the Hotel￾Dieu, but he departed immediately for the purpose of entering the Hospital of la Charite, which he soon
quitted, and into which he was again received, June 9th, 1800. All the animal functions were
benumbed; he scarcely answered the questions which were asked him; the features were altered, the
countenance grown old, pale, yellowish and bloated; ... The hand laid over the region of the heart felt
no irregularity in its strokes, which might rationally be attributed to the considerable oedema of the
parietes of the thorax.... The pulse was frequent, small and irregular.
The very dull sound of the region of the heart, the character of the pulse, dyspnoea, color of the
lips, expression of the countenance, . . . induced me to suspect a lesion of this organ. The prognosis
was that the patient must die soon. Medicine gave no relief.... [on] 12th of June, ... he died when
asking for drink, without a symptom of distress.
On dissection ... [t]he pericardium contained a little water. The heart was somewhat larger than
natural; ... The large portion of the mitral valve, which lies before the orifice of the aorta, held no
longer by the tendinous threads to the columnae carneae in which these filaments terminated. At its
edge, become loose, many species of very irregular and long vegetations were appended, imitating
certain venereal excrescences ... 18
Corvisart's ability to make a precise diagnosis on a correlation between the clinical aspect
and pathological anatomy was something which, according to P Rayer,19 often surprised his
listeners. He was "a pioneer of pathological anatomy; every case dying on his wards was
autopsied". 20 Corvisart regularly placed his hand over his patient's chest during clinical
examinations (we have seen that Lazare Riviere was already doing this in 1646). This
practice provided him with an important semiological datum-the heart "'murmur".21 After
palpation, he also performed percussion conceived forty years earlier by Auenbrugger.

The Englishman Allan Burns (1781-1813) had a different view of how vegetations
were formed. He was interested in the effect of the changed structure of the heart valves
and large arteries and in his description of an autopsy, noted that:
The left auricle contained a concretion larger than a pigeon's egg; this substance was of an irregular
form, it appeared as if it had been composed of several portions forcibly pressed together; it was of
firm consistence, but somewhat friable, and of granular structure; it ... adhered firmly to the side
of the cavity . . . 22
The term "concretion" conjures up the image of an agglomeration of granular, friable
particles which adhere to the wall and not an outgrowth or budding of the tissue. Burns
mentioned a "frothy lymph" on the inside of the auricle. He reported three cases of mitral
stenosis and also described "a very unusual fluttering in the breast." Is this the "murmur"
which Corvisart spoke of? Quite likely.
Friedrich Kreysig of Germany wrote in 1815 about "polypous carditis" and the effect
of rheumatism on the heart. According to him, the polypous concretions of the heart cavity
were products and therefore proofs of inflammation.23 In Kreysig's opinion, rheumatic
metastasis was not so much an alteration of the inner lining of the heart as the presence of
"blood clots" in the heart cavity. According to this theory of concretions, coagulation
occurs before adherence to the cardiac membrane.
Ear to Heart
In 1816, Theophile Laennec (1781-1826), a pupil of Corvisart's, invented his
"cylindrical" stethoscope, which greatly improved auscultation, especially cardiac
auscultation.24 It took several years for doctors to become accustomed to putting their ear
to their patient's chest to listen to what was happening and draw conclusions. Others
before had looked, then others such as Riviere and Corvisart had touched, and now
Laennec was listening. This was even harder. In fact, it seems that it was doctors' sense
of decency and the moral standards of the day which were partly responsible for the
invention of the stethoscope. It avoided the doctor placing his ear directly against the
patient's chest.
Laennec published the first edition of his De l'auscultation midiate in 1819.25 He
disagreed with his teacher on the origin of valvular vegetations, writing that:

Towards a History ofInfective Endocarditis
The venereal origin of these excrescences, entertained by M. Corvisart, appears to me very
improbable, when we consider their rarity and the frequency of venereal complaints, and when we
meet with them, as we do, in individuals who, in all probability, never had this disease.26
In spite of his careful choice of words, Laennec's last argument, which contradicted the
venereal aetiology of the vegetations, was convincing. James Hope would later confirm
Laennec's observations in 1832.27
There was therefore no real construction of a clinical entity up to 1830. Besides, the
argument that the valvular vegetations had syphilitic origins was refuted. However, some
of the lesions' effects on the "heart's mechanics" were noted, especially certain signs or
"noises". A number of symptoms were described fairly accurately, although they were not
necessarily related to the valvular vegetations: palpitations, respiratory difficulty, swollen
legs, rheumatic pain, coughing, fever, fatigue and dyspnoea. The observation of
"vegetations", "concretions" or "outgrowths" on the heart valves or in the heart cavity
during autopsy did not lead to the identification of a specific disease. These various
abnormalities, alterations or lesions can be deceiving in that what was observed was a
final picture, a post-mortem. It was therefore difficult at times to know what was there at
the outset, what followed and even what could have appeared after death in a disease that
became more and more complicated over time.
Improved clinical observation techniques, information gained through percussion and
auscultation gradually established symptoms which corresponded to lesions observed
during autopsy. There then was a search for a means of detecting these lesions in the live
patient. In Paris especially, a veritable "research spirit" turned the hospital into a sort of
laboratory, in addition to being a teaching institution.28 The hospital then became the
autopsy centre and between 1800 and 1850 Paris became something of a medical
lighthouse. It is within this context that J B Bouillaud, one of the great contributors to
hospital medicine at the time, established a specific nosography.
II
Bouillaud's Endocarditis
Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud (1796-1881) entitled his thesis written in 1823 Essai sur le
diagnostic des aneurismes de l'aorte with special emphasis on the use of auscultation. The
following year, he wrote a Memoire sur le retretcissement de l'un des orifices du coeur et
sur les effets de cette lesion. This work was, in fact, the prelude to his future research on
heart disease. In 1824, Bertin and Bouillaud jointly published a Traite6 des maladies du
coeur et des gros vaisseaux. In their introduction, they spoke of "the outer membrane of
the heart, the pericardium, and the inner membrane of the heart which joins the inner

Alain Contrepois
lining of the vessels ... It forms the heart valves by folding over on itself and around a
fibrous tissue."29 The formulation of the sentence seemed to be leading to a precise term
for the inner membrane but this was not the case.
Naming the Parts
"So little is known about the disease whose history is being traced here that it does not
even have a specific name. My proposal in this respect seems to conform to the current
general principles of nomenclature." So said Bouillaud in the first edition of his Traite
clinique des maladies du coeur, published in 1835.30 He took up from where Bichat left
off, but went further; after identifying the outer membrane, the pericardium, he gave a
name to the inner membrane: "endocardium". The diseases which affect this tissue, he
said, occur more frequently than is believed, often going undetected at the acute stage
before going on to attain chronic proportions:
I am not exaggerating when I say that the affections of the endocardium, or the inner membrane of
the heart, are the most usual starting point, the most frequent generator of these multiple organic
lesions, whether in the valves, the walls or the cavity of the heart.31
We are, therefore, at the very centre, at the heart of the heart, so to speak, at the point of
origin or genesis of the affection of this central, vital organ. After describing the
membrane, Bouillaud went on to add:
Normally the surface of the endocardium is extremely smooth. However, as a result of certain
morbid diseases, this membrane can become uneven, rough and bumpy, so to speak. This lack of
smoothness necessarily increases friction against the blood column which spans the heart cavity . . . It is not known if, like the pericardium, the endocardium secretes a serous liquid which lubricates
the inner surface.32
These two excerpts are important for understanding how Bouillaud saw the chronology
of events. Certain morbid diseases can bring about a slight alteration of the endocardium,
itself in turn automatically causing friction of the blood column in this region of the heart.
Is this friction the cause of inflammation or is it a contributing factor? This local
inflammation of the endocardium could be the direct cause of organic lesions in the valves
and other structures of the heart.
Bouillaud extended Broussais' ideas on the "seat" of infection, irritation and "local
inflammation". As far as Broussais was concerned, there was, in fact, only one cause of
disease: irritation leading to local inflammation resulting in other lesions, but fever was
only a symptom of irritation. There was no "fever" as an illness in itself. Broussais
claimed that initial inflammation was generally gastric and intestinal.33 Bouillaud

disagreed with his mentor on this point because he believed that a specific process of
irritation occurred in the endocardium, on the heart valves in particular. He pointed out (p.
271) that even the most serious of several diseases attacking the centre of the circulatory
system were subject to "the same influences" as those affecting other organs. The heart
had found a new source of morbid diseases and this particularly in "febrile diseases".
Which febrile diseases? Bouillaud was not very explicit. He claimed that valvular
vegetations could be due to various "viruses", especially the syphilitic virus, but according
to him, the existence of this virus "has been questioned by a number of modem
observers".34 Furthermore, inflammation of the inner and outer membranes of the heart
either accompanied or followed inflammation of the pleura and the lungs or the
serofibrinous tissue of the joints (acute rheumatoid arthritis).35 Bouillaud argued that this
affection was one of the causes of inflammation of the endocardium. He also highlighted
the following signs: high skin temperature with diaphoresis at certain times of the day,
shivering accompanying the fever and a bellows murmur.
Constructing the Natural History of the Disease
The systematic performance of autopsies allowed Bouillaud to measure the frequency
of endocarditis and to identify its different stages: normal heart, redness and thickening,
valvular vegetations, valvular damage. One of these stages consisted of his inflammation
theory, although he did not admit it: "We would like our readers to know that we were not
guided by any preconceived theory in what we have to say about inflammation of the
endocardium, but rather, the theory followed the facts".36
However, according to Bouillaud, if inflammation made its presence felt in this way
only, medicine would be a blind science:
The doctor arrives at a diagnosis of the illness by studying the causes which have had an impact on
the patient, by analysing the physical signs and functional lesions and by observing the development
of the disease and its effect on the body. The pathological anatomy only complements, so to speak,
what we already know.37
When he spoke of "the effect [of the affection] on the body", he seemed to be referring to
reactions and symptoms apart from local cardiac lesions.
According to Bouillaud, the first phase of endocarditis consisted of blood congestion,
softening of the membrane and suppuration but, he pointed out, the last was hard to prove:
"Blood flows so rapidly and with such force through the heart's cavities that the substance
which is gradually secreted by the inflamed endocardium must be constantly swept away
by this flow of blood".38 During the second phase, the secreted substances are formed into
vegetations or granulations which have a particular preference for the valves, although
they are also found on the inner surface of the heart's cavities. These greyish-white

"fibrinous vegetations" are easily detached. They can be small or large, they can come
singly or in groups. Grouping of vegetations results in blockage of the openings at which
the valves are located. In the third phase, the valves undergo cartilaginous induration and
the heart's orifices are blocked to a much greater extent and may even be gradually
destroyed. Of the four "general" symptoms pathologists have identified with
inflammation, three are not immediately evident upon examination of the endocardium;
namely, heat, redness and swelling. The fourth symptom, pain, is absent in most cases:
This symptom is often replaced by faintness and a feeling of suffocation in the precordium ... Much
attention must be paid to the physical signs detected upon examination, palpation, percussion and
auscultation. The bellows murmur, which sometimes masks the normal sounds of the heart, can be
detected through auscultation ... This puffing, grating or sawing sound is sometimes short and
spasmodic or long, prolonged and "drawn out", so to speak. A fairly high fever usually accompanies
acute endocarditis.39
Bouillaud did not give any details on patients' temperatures. But we know that he noted
the increase or decrease of "calorification" or heat production. Admittedly, the
thermometer was not in frequent use at the time, but Bouillaud was among the first to
recognize its practical value. He insisted that rest of the diseased organ, which is part of
the treatment of acute and chronic diseases, was not applicable in the case of the heart.
This idea would influence the treatment of these affections: extraction of large quantities
of blood, to allow the heart to rest by reducing its circulatory function.
Clinical observation No. 13 of J B Bouillaud (1835):
A young girl, 18 years old, of delicate and scrofulous constitution, was admitted to the Clinic on
December 22, 1832. She had been coughing excessively for 2 weeks, was expectorating a lot of
mucous substance and complained of feelings of suffocation and general discomfort Large
bubbles of mucous rale were detected on both sides of the chest. When the lungs were auscultated
from her back we were surprised to hear a distinct, extremely short puffing systolic murmur during
ventricular contraction ...
Diagnosis: general bronchitis with blockage of the lungs; thickening starting with the valves of
the heart with slight blockage of one orifice. Our observations during the earlier part of the disease
and the absence of any indication of organic heart disease before the current affection left us in doubt
as to the lesion which really caused the bellows murmur ...
Prescription: Blood-letting in two bleeding bowls, herbal tea, starvation diet. The following day
we recommended that two scarified cupping glasses be placed at the back of the chest. There was
some improvement but suddenly, on December 31, the suffocation became so great that the patient
died during the day. An autopsy was performed 18 hours after death and the following observations
were made: .. . The aortic valves were red but not thickened. The mitral valve was thicker and its
free end completely covered with multiple, convergent vegetations resembling leeks or venereal
cauliflower; they were fibrinous, friable and easily crushed by the blade of the scalpel The
condition of the valve obviously impeded its movement and thus prevented total blockage of the
orifice at which it is located.40
In 1835, Bouillaud was convinced that whether occurring in isolation or along with
other "plegmasias" (inflammations), the following signs would henceforth define a
clinical entity: progressive local lesion (valvular vegetations following inflammation),

Towards a History ofInfective Endocarditis
certain clinical signs, in particular the "bellows murmur" detected during auscultation, and
frequent fever. But, according to him, endocarditis developed in two ways: either under
the influence of immediate, direct causes ("primitive" or "idiopathic" endocarditis) or it
occurred after, or concomitant with, another "phlegmasia" ("consecutive" or
"sympathetic" endocarditis) such as pleuropneumonia, phlebitis or acute rheumatoid
arthritis. He defined acute rheumatoid arthritis as an illness characterized by fever, pain in
the joints, excessive sweating and other manifestations, especially in relation to the heart.
He claimed that there was no specific determining cause but that it occurred "during
atmospheric changes especially after prolonged exposure to relatively dry cold, or above
all humid cold where a significant increase in body heat had led to perspiration".41
However, by 1841, in the second edition of his Traite clinique des maladies du coeur,
Bouillaud had refined his ideas and divided endocarditis into two broad clinical
categories.42 The first was a purely inflammatory affection which either developed
independently, and was quite infrequent, or became evident during acute rheumatoid
arthritis, pleurisy or pleuropneumonia. This was what Bouillaud referred to as "simple"
endocarditis. The second category included the so-called "typhoid" diseases (putrid and
septic). At the time, the generic term "typhus" or "typhoid fever" covered several febrile
syndromes usually accompanied by stupor and delirium (these last two terms persisted
long after the differentiation was made between typhoid and typhus; the term "tuphos"
was kept). In this category, inflammation was the essential factor but it was greatly
modified by the typhoid element. Bouillaud called it "typhic endocarditis" but was careful
to point out that by this he meant endocarditis modified by a coexistent typhoid state and
not endocarditis that gave rise to typhoid-related factors. He, therefore, established no
direct link between the local cardiac lesion and certain general factors which were
unrelated to purely circulatory problems. He spoke about two concomitant affections. The
first was "septic", provoking the development of the second, which was localized in the
endocardium and was "inflammatory".
This very complex issue concerning a local disease which could become generalized
and a generalized disease which could become localized was to be long debated in the
discussion on endocarditis. The nature and cause of valvular vegetations as well as other
factors outside the heart were to fuel another lively debate.

From Local to General Disease
Embolisms
The Englishman William Senhouse Kirkes described certain phenomena attributed to
the consequences of the release of fragments of cardiac vegetations into the blood￾stream.43 According to him, the "fibrinous concretions" or "outgrowths" were broken

down in the diseased valve. This could cause pieces of concretion of varying size to enter
the blood-stream and block a vessel, depending on the size of the foreign body. Symptoms
would then appear similar to those observed in typhus, phlebitis and other diseases where
"the blood undergoes profound changes". He also described cases of patients with a
systolic "murmur", fever, sometimes sweating and spots on the skin ("spots of a pinkish
colour"), and who had succumbed to softening of the brain and hemiplegia, and other
forms of paralysis or phlebitis. In some cases, the attack was preceded by acute
rheumatoid arthritis a few weeks before. During autopsy, several valvular vegetations
were observed and endocarditis was diagnosed. A fibrinous coagulum was sometimes
found in a cerebral artery, in the kidneys or in the spleen.44
The local lesion, in this case the vegetations on the endocardium, was therefore,
according to Kirkes, the point of departure for general or local lesions outside the heart
which were unrelated to circulatory insufficiency. This idea is totally different from those
expressed by Bouillaud, who had never imagined such a possibility. The cause of the
initial lesion on the endocardium, which was a point of major concern for Bouillaud, was,
however, not addressed by Kirkes.
Other researchers later subscribed to Kirkes' view of the disease but the frame of
reference for explaining the appearance of the vegetations was not always clear. Rudolf
Virchow supported the inflammatory theory but his approach was less "clinical" and more
"physiological" than Bouillaud's.45 He was, in fact, greatly influenced by the ideas which
he developed in a study, entitled Die Cellularpathologie, on the microscopic examination
of the fibrinous substance of the vegetations and infarctions. In chapter 10, headed
'Metastatical dyscrasiae' in the English translation, he pointed out that "thromboses"
which travelled through the veins were also present in the heart where they appeared as
"cysts" or as albuminous tumours.46 Parts of these thrombi would become detached, be
transported in the blood-stream and embedded in vessels located far away from the heart.
This would give rise to the morbid phenomenon usually referred to by Virchow as
"embolism".
This was confirmed in Germany and France, notably in 1861 by Jean-Martin Charcot
(1825-1893) and Alfred Vulpian (1826-1887).47 In their joint study they referred to
Bouillaud and cited the studies carried out by Virchow, Rokitansky and Kirkes. These
references are significant because they show that after Bouillaud, in-depth research on this
subject was conducted less frequently in France than in Germany or England. Charcot and

Towards a History ofInfective Endocarditis
Vulpian indicated the symptoms which accompanied the typhic forms of endocarditis:
high temperature, shivering, palpable spleen, sweating and sometimes small red spots on
various parts of the body. They said that these symptoms were due to the "intoxication"
induced by a "morbid poison" present in the blood and constantly produced in the
abnormal endocardium. The typhic aspect was therefore secondary, appearing several
days after the affection of the endocardium and this seemed to be the only explanation for
the secondary development. Their autopsy report of a case of acute endocarditis indicates
that microscopic examination of the valvular vegetations was done, that these were made
up of fibrillar fibrin and that there were very few leucocytes but numerous "small
granulations" (on which the authors made no comment). In this study, Charcot and
Vulpian combined the ideas of Bouillaud with those of Kirkes and Virchow. Bouillaud
believed that the typhic aspect succeeded the inflammatory alteration of the endocardium
and Kirkes and Virchow wrote about the embolisms outside the heart created by fibrinous
particles of valvular vegetations. However, some clinicians disagreed as to the local cause
of the general symptoms observed in people with endocarditis.48 They believed that the
lesion on the endocardium could not, by itself, produce all the various symptoms and that
the specific aspects of the disease were due to the fact that. it affected weak and cachectic
people. The role of the "terrain", therefore, needed to be examined even before trying to
explain the presence of these mysterious microscopic granulations. Was the local lesion
then the point of departure for the general symptoms or was the disease first general and
then localized on the endocardium?
From England, Samuel Wilks entered the debate in 1870 and proposed scarlet fever (a
general disease) as a possible cause of the local valvular lesions on the endocardium.49 He
went over Kirkes' ideas on embolisms outside the heart and postulated that, in addition to
the consequences resulting from the release of fragments of intracardiac fibrinous
vegetations into the blood-stream, fibrinous deposits in the small vessels of organs (in
particular the spleen, liver and kidney) could be due to changes in the blood itself.
The numerous microscopic observations Virchow made of the thrombi gradually
revealed a vast number of "small granules", smaller than the nucleus of a leucocyte. He
found that they were insoluble in potassium hydroxide, acetic acid and nitric acid. But it
appears that Virchow paid very little attention to these granules, or at any rate, he did not
include them in the theory of cellular pathology or in his ideas on endocarditis. He was to
continue in that vein until 1871, when in the fourth edition of Die Cellularpathologie, at
the end of the tenth chapter he discussed the role of "these small organisms classified as
bacteria, vibrios and micrococci which we have agreed to consider as being vegetal".50
However, until then Virchow had still not really discussed the role of these bacteria in the
endocardium. It should be noted that in 1855 Rokitansky had already detected the
presence of "small granulations" resistant to acetic acid in the vegetations on the mitral
valve.51

At that time, it was difficult for doctors to make pronouncements on the nature of the
"small granulations" observed in the vegetations. They were unable to determine the
function of these microscopic forms and saw no way of relating them to a pathological
process. For something to be analysed, it is not enough merely to be aware of its presence;
there has to be an accompanying theory. It was only in July 1861 that Pasteur published a
M6moire sur les corpuscules organises qui existent dans l'atmosphere.52 In a study on
suppurative endocarditis published in 1862, Lancereaux pointed out that "until now very
little is known" about the causes of this disease.53 However, he also mentioned the
presence of an abundance of "small granulations" in the fibrinous concretions of the heart
valves and in the blood observed under the microscope. These granulations, which moved
in all directions, were resistant to alkalis and were, according to Lancereaux, foreign
elements.
"Parasitic" Disease
In 1869, the Norwegian Emmanuel Winge (1817-1894) described a very important
case to the Medical Society of Christiania (Oslo) which was reported by Gaston Lion.54
A completely healthy man removed a corn from the sole of his feet. Five days after it had
suppurated, he started to shiver and to sweat heavily; his skin was covered in purpuric
spots, his knee joints became very painful, the first heart beat appeared as a "drawling"
sound. Within twenty-five days the patient succumbed to the disease. During autopsy,
Winge noticed vegetative endocarditis on both sides of the heart, as well as embolisms in
the lungs, the left kidney and the spleen. He saw "on the aortic valves grey, felt-like
masses, resembling pebbles and which were easily detached".55 Under the microscope,
these thrombus-type masses seemed to be made up of a fine network of fibrinous filament.
With greater magnifying power, "these filaments appeared to be entangled with micro￾organisms which looked like strings of either short, round beads or tiny sticks, somewhat
like leptothrix rosaries". These bodies were resistant to both alkalis and acids. Winge
willingly admitted that they were "parasitic" organisms which, having entered the blood￾stream through a plantar excoriation, were transported to the heart through the veins. He
suggested that the affection be called "Mycosis endocardii".
This theory marks an extremely important stage in the understanding of the
pathophysiological process of endocarditis. Not only did Winge draw attention to the
"parasitic" nature of the disease, but he also suggested that these "parasites", introduced
into the organism via the skin, were transported in the blood to the heart where they
attached themselves to the endocardium. He therefore accorded a primary pathogenic role
to these organisms contained in the tissues taken from the body during autopsy and
observed under the microscope. His initiative, which seemed quite novel at the time, also
had an experimental side as, after the clinical and patho-anatomical observation was
completed, he injected some of the vegetation taken from the dead patient into the skin of

a rabbit's back. However, the animal survived after the injection. It is difficult to say
precisely how Winge arrived at assigning this pathogenic role to the micro-organisms. The
term "leptothrix" leads one to think that the studies of botanists such as Ernst Hallier
(1831 - 1904) of Germany might have influenced him.56 The "plant-like parasites" are
also reminiscent of the work of the Italian Agostino Bassi who spoke of "plant-like micro￾organisms" and "parasitic mushrooms".57
Three years later, another Norwegian, Hjalmar Heiberg, reopened the discussion on
Winge's observations and himself reported a case of puerperal endocarditis which closely
resembled the case cited by Winge.58 According to him, the vegetations on the mitral
valve and the embolisms of the kidneys and spleen contained uniformly-shaped micro￾organisms, strung out on a sort of chain. He claimed that the uterine wound acted as an
"entrance". Heiberg believed that the parasite in both cases was the leptothrix. However,
Virchow, who had studied Heiberg's preparations, added certain comments to Heiberg's
article. He claimed that it was wrong to use the term leptothrix because these micro￾organisms were "vibrions" (he was referring to a classification devised by C G Ehrenberg
who included in this term the micro-organisms which would later be known as cocci and
bacilli). It should not be forgotten that the observations of Winge, Heiberg and Virchow
were made prior to the introduction of staining methods for micro-organisms. Many
similar observations were made throughout Europe, particularly in Germany, over the next
two years (1874 and 1875). But very often the histological and microscopic tests were
carried out only on the corpse and sometimes long after death. Bacteria cultures were not
yet being done, injection of animals was rare and, when done, produced very few usable
results. However, the techniques of microscopic examination gradually improved.
Shortly afterwards, Edwin Klebs (1834-1913) of Germany expressed his conviction
that all cases of endocarditis were of infectious origin, illustrating this with twenty-seven
autopsies showing the presence of micro-organisms in the valvular vegetations in each
case.59 That same year-1878-another German researcher, Karl Koester, postulated that
the micrococci entered the vessels the valves were fitted to, thus causing irritation which
began in the more internal parts before moving on to the more superficial.60 The following
year, Joseph Hamburg, a student of Virchow's, discussed the question of how the micro￾organisms- penetrated the valvular vegetations.61 His article reflects the extent of the
rivalry that still existed between the inflammatory and infectious theories. Moreover, his
study represented the first attempt at experimental reproduction of the cardiovascular
lesion. Hamburg had two hypotheses: (1) the parasites were transported in the blood￾stream and penetrated the vegetations and heart valves mechanically, from the outside to
the inside; (2) the vessels on the inside of the valvular tissue were obstructed by
embolisms caused by germs. He also mentioned the two theories about how micro￾organisms entered the blood-stream in the first place: (1) from healthy lungs or intestines;

(2) from a point of infection such as a wound.
In order to examine the inflammatory and infectious aspects of the initial valvular
lesion, at the request of Virchow, Hamburg undertook an in-depth microscopic study of
the vegetations and heart valves based on fourteen endocarditis autopsy cases.62 He
detected micrococci in four only. According to him (and no doubt his teacher Virchow
shared the same conviction), the other cases were characterized by inflammation to a
greater or lesser degree, usually accompanied by underlying tissue destruction. This
contradicted Koester's theory, in particular, as he believed that if the valves were exposed
over a long period to abnormal mechanical attacks, this would create a favourable terrain
for bacteria. However, the bacteria would not pose any problems in these physiological
conditions as long as the valves remained intact. Hamburg disagreed. To prove his point,
Hamburg induced extensive inflammation in the femoral artery of an animal. This, he
said, closely resembled "recent acute endocarditis". As he found no micro-organisms in
this experimental "endocarditis" (he probably meant to write "endarteritis"), he was led to
believe that acute endocarditis was not necessarily caused by a micrococcus but appeared
in a similar manner to parenchymatous inflammations. It was probably the strong
influence of Virchow's theory which prevented Hamburg, the student, from going further
in trying to find a possible connection between the inflammatory and infectious theories.
Germain See (1818-1896), somewhat separated from the others within the French
school and an ardent admirer of German methods, was responsible for promoting in
France the work that was being done on this disease in Germany. There was no doubt in
his mind that "'ulcerative' endocarditis was an acute illness with intense fever, serious
general symptoms and all the characteristics of so-called 'infectious' diseases . . . If the
cardiac lesion was responsible for most of the morbid manifestations, it was because it
was also subject to an infection probably of parasitic origin". See, however, posed
questions on the pathological process and the terminology used to describe this disease:
"Does it really involve an inflammation as the name endocarditis suggests?". The initial
lesions would support this interpretation. But from the moment that the presence of micro￾organisms in the detritus was detected by Winge, Heiberg and others, "we thought we had
found the explanation for the alarming rate of inflammation ifn this disease". See believed
that, in certain cases, the fibrinous deposits produced an inflammatory reaction before
forming outgrowths or vegetations-the reason this type of endocarditis had been
qualified as "vegetative". In other cases, there was "necrobiosis" of underlying tissue,
which gave rise to the term "ulcerative" endocarditis.63
For the very first time, Pasteur's name appeared in an article on endocarditis: See
recognized "M. Pasteur's outstanding work" on anthrax and its parasitic nature. See
believed that it was the parasitic nature of endocarditis which was responsible for the
general symptoms observed: high fever (temperature of 39°C, 400 and up to 410 even) and
shivering, in particular. The typhic aspect of the disease resulted from "the adulteration of
the blood through bacterial infection". Furthermore, See believed that when the
ecchymotic spots appeared, especially on the limbs, they were of "great pathognomonic

value". The prognosis was all the more serious in the absence of a known case of a cure.
He thought that no treatment that had yet been tried (including salicylic acid) had been
effective: "If future therapeutics provides us with more effective means of fighting
endocarditis, it will certainly come from attacking the root cause, that is, parasitic
infection".64
However, things are never so simple and, shortly afterwards, Michel Peter, in his Traite'
clinique et pratique des maladies du coeur, although not questioning the existence of
"parasites", expressed reservations and was inclined to believe that these micro-organisms
were the result and not the cause of endocarditis.65 "The fact that a micro-organism has
been detected does not mean that it is efficient; and even if it contributes to the
development of the disease, how do we prove that it is sufficient?".66 This was the big
debate at the time.
All that was known about endocarditis was that the valvular vegetations and the
infarctions generally contained micro-organisms. But from the literature of that period, the
problem seems to have been posed in the following way: in order to base Winge's
hypothesis on a solid foundation, it was necessary to proVe that the bacteria had grown in
the vegetations on the valves during the patient's lifetime; that they existed in the blood￾stream and were not just putrefaction agents. It was also important to find out if the
infectious agent was the same in all cases, and if it was a case of a specific affection or
secondary disease or of a localization that was common to different morbid species.
Although, so far, all attempts had been inconclusive, it was important to try to reproduce
endocarditis in experiments on animals so as to provide additional proof in support of the
infectious nature of the disease.
IV
Experimental Reproduction of the Disease
Necessary and Sufficient Cause
Pathogenic germs gradually began to be better known thanks to the work of various
scientists and doctors across Europe, including Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and his team
in France, and Robert Koch (1843-1910) and others in Germany.67 The affirmation of the
presence of pathogenic germs in the blood-stream and their culture in an appropriate
medium clearly marked the birth of bacteriology. An unprecedented experimental strategy
was needed to define properly the micro-organism; not only in terms of its form
(description and classification) and physiology, but also in terms of its pathogenic or non￾pathogenic function. This complex strategy needed to become a codified laboratory
routine so that microbiology could be an "ordinary science".68

It was agreed that an infection could be transmitted through the blood and in 1869
Winge postulated his theory on the transportation of "parasites" from a local cutaneous
lesion to the heart. It was important to establish the presence of micro-organisms in the
blood because the blood being "the main canal of the body", the centre of distribution, the
presence of micro-organisms could lead to diseases being spread to other points away
from the original point of affection. Besides, the idea of "cultivating" blood is, of course,
closely related to the concept of autonomous, live, pathogenic germs which can therefore
multiply and be cultivated. Pasteur stressed the importance of blood tests and blood
cultures of animals or living human beings. For him, "a septicaemia is an affection
produced by germs which break down the organism's barriers and which are transported
by the blood in particular".69
A long period of much trial and error facilitated the gradual improvement of blood tests
and culture techniques in order to prevent contamination and to encourage the
multiplication of germs. The first blood tests were carried out on women with puerperal
fever, by using a pin to prick the tip of their index finger which was previously washed
and wiped with a sterilized cloth. These blood samples allowed Pasteur to obtain pure
bacteria cultures. Different culture media were tested: chicken broth, yeast, urine, Liebig's
meat broth medium; tests on aerobiosis and anaerobiosis, etc. All this required a
considerable practical know-how. "Placing a sterile pipette against the wound and taking
a sample of blood, putting a few drops in the urine; these were all new achievements".70
However, a prick in the index finger with a needle draws only a few drops of blood,
which Pasteur thought was not enough: "It would be quite useful to find a patient who
would be willing to receive several pricks in various parts of the body so that we could set
up a number of cultures simultaneously or if not, blood from the general circulatory
system". This idea of taking blood from different points on the body in order to "track
down the germ" indicates not only that Pasteur believed that the germs circulated in the
blood7l but also illustrates the technical difficulty of getting a sample large enough to
facilitate germ culture. In 1880, blood cultures were systematically done within the
hospital context by Jacques Doleris, an obstetrician, on the advice of Pasteur. However,
blood sampling was often done posthumously or on dying patients. Doleris noted that the
cultures were frequently positive when there was a sudden marked increase in the patient's
69 What was the meaning of the word
"septicaemia" in France at that time? Littre and
Robin's 1878 Dictionnaire de medecine defines it as
an "alteration of the blood which is either a
phenomenon of the blood itself or occurs as a result
of a wound". However, the 1881 edition of the
Dictionnaire encyclope'dique des sciences medicales
(Raige-Delorme and A Dechambre, 100 vols,
1864-89), points out the influence of the new ideas
on infectious pathology: "Although the word
'septicaemia' is derived from the Greek 'septikos',
that which produces putrefaction, the meaning has
gradually changed. One is less inclined to include
putrid infections which only include toxaemia linked
to the existence of a decomposition centre where
organic matter is slowly putrified. True septicaemia
is a purulent infection resulting from the entry and
multiplication in the body of microscopic organisms
which have been described and studied by M
Pasteur". The author of this article does not,
however, see the practical use of blood cultures in
diagnosing infections: "Vibrio cultures taken from
the live patient and the reproduction of septicaemia
in animals are not practical procedures and clinical
medicine requires shorter and easier methods. The
search for the septic vibrio or the pustulant organism
does not support clinical diagnosis".

temperature or when there was shivering.72 Between 1880 and 1885, as soon as a new
bacterial infection was detected, the germ was tracked down in the blood to be matched
against one found in another part of the body. So, blood cultures were no longer used for
simply verifying a diagnosis. The development of this medical practice evolved as much
from new technical and material possibilities as from increased knowledge of human
pathology.73 However, the technical problems related to bacteriological blood culture
were not resolved, in particular the amount of sample taken (a simple prick on the finger
could not produce enough blood) and the constant risk of contamination. A marked
improvement was brought by the French invention of the piston syringe made from elder's
pith and, unlike Pravaz's syringe, easy to sterilize.74 In Germany, Sittmann used the
syringe designed by Luer with a glass body and asbestos piston. Malassez of France was
to design a syringe made completely of glass.75 Blood sampling became gradually more
standardized over the next few years and what was later to be called "hemoculture", in
French, was born-a perfect example of the marriage of a theoretical "revolution" (i.e.,
the germ theory) and technical innovations.76
It was, therefore, no longer a question of observing, under the microscope, samples of
lesions detected during autopsy but of trying to discover the micro-organisms responsible
for the disease in the "live" patient. This new attitude to the disease gave rise to a new
clinical practice, a different kind of interaction with the patient and his body: the patient's
body was "inhabited" by microscopic germs which circulated and grew inside it. These
had to be tracked down by taking samples of blood, urine, pus, etc., and adding them to
the culture media. This meant that there had to be close collaboration between laboratory
work and the process of medical diagnosis.
Human endocarditis, blood culture and inoculation of animals were all mentioned in
Arnold Netter's work. In 1881, Netter, an intern supervised by Joseph Grancher, submitted
to the latter a paper for the 1881 competition entitled 'Recherches sur la nature de
l'endocardite ulcereuse'. Reporting on his student's work, Grancher wrote that Netter
studied organisms in the blood of live patients; he used chicken broth cultures to show that these
germs were alive; he injected rabbits and, despite the relative success of his injections, believed that
he could prove that the germs were, in fact, the cause of the disease.
Of the sampling of the blood of patients who were clinically proven to have endocarditis,
Netter went on to say that he pricked the tip of the index finger which had been washed
in alcohol with a sterilised lancet and drew a few drops of blood into a pipette which he
immediately sealed with the torch. He observed the germs under the microscope. A blood
sample was then incubated in the culture medium in M. Bouchard's laboratory. After

forty-eight hours, there were "some magnificent rosary-like chains". Netter's conclusion
seemed to be based on the diversity of types of microbes observed: "endocarditis is an
anatomical and clinical symptom which can appear during various infections."
The germ theory, therefore, played a vital role in rendering micro-organisms of living
particles useful for the study of the disease. After making this "choice", which was more
of a "gamble" than anything else, doctors could turn to such questions as causality,
research and treatment of causes. The disease was seen as a relatively coherent whole
where the symptoms were related to etiology and that opened the era of the experimental
reproduction of diseases in laboratories. The germ theory only temporarily supported the
idea of a specific medical cause. This could not really be applied to endocarditis in which,
over time, several types of micro-organisms were found to exist in the lesions or in the
blood. This fact was of extreme importance because it contradicted the idea that one single
micro-organism had to correspond to one disease. But this did not apply only to
endocarditis; similar observations were made for pneumonia, pleurisy, angina, etc. Hence
the reason for the term "infectious" endocarditis employed by Grancher in 1884.
Subsequently, Grancher himself made a clinical observation (1884):
Len. Marc, 32-years-old, was admitted at the Necker Hospital on July 21, 1883 ... In April 1882,
the patient had been afflicted with generalized acute rheumatoid arthritis with cardiac complications.
At the beginning of May 1883, he had a violent attack of oppression with cardiac palpitations ...
During the months of June and July, the inappetence, fatigue, palpitations and pallor increased,
which led the patient to enter hospital. He was in a marked state of prostration, his face was pale and
thin. The inappetence and weakness continued along with the palpitations coupled with precordial
malaise and insomnia. Temperature: 39°8C in the evening; 3805 in the morning ... We heard a
diastolic murmur at the base of the heart. Diagnosis: over-stress, aortic insufficiency. On July 25,
hemiplegic paralysis ... The dyspnoea became so intense and the precordial oppression so great that
we were led to think that it might be ulcerative endocarditis ... Prostration steadily continued up to
August 10 accompanied by delirium at night, high fever (temperature fluctuating around 390),
shivering and finally oedema in the lower limbs. On August 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, I daily cultured a
drop of the patient's blood, "sterilely taken", in 20g of Pasteur medium. After 24 hours, each of these
cultures produced small, whitish, round grains . . . The blood examined under the microscope
contained micrococci which appeared either singly or in pairs. The patient died on August 10.
During the autopsy, I took a "pure" sample of blood from the left auricle and ventricle to be cultured
(I obtained the same micro-organism as when the patient was alive). The autopsy verified the
diagnosis: ulcerative endocarditis due to the aortic valves' appearance as dropsical swellings
covered by rough, granular, soft vegetation ... An examination under the microscope revealed an
infinite number of minute but very uniform micrococci, scattered over the surface of the vegetations
... When the grains from the culture medium were compared with those on the vegetations, they
were discovered to be of the same organism, which were coloured with gentian blue.... There is
no doubt, therefore, that while Len. was alive, his blood contained micrococci which could grow and
live in contact with oxygen.... We had yet to determine the pathogenic role of these bacteria in
Len.'s illness. Was this disease, which should be called infective endocarditis rather than ulcerative
endocarditis as there was no visible ulceration on the endocardium, due to aerobic bacteria found in
the blood, was the bacteria an accessory or concomitant element? In order to solve this problem, the
disease would have to be reproduced in inoculated animals.7

Towards a History of Infective Endocarditis
In order to prove that the germ was the cause of "infectious" endocarditis, it was
therefore deemed necessary to reproduce the infection in an animal. The quoted references
indicate that Grancher was not only familiar with the work of Pasteur, as would be
expected, but also with that of German researchers, in particular Klebs. The idea of there
being a cause which was necessary to the development of certain infectious diseases78
became popular between 1860 and 1870 thanks to Carl Mayrhofer, Jacob Henle and
Edwin Klebs in particular, and later Pasteur and Koch.79 In an article published in 1876
on ammoniacal urine, Pasteur outlined a strategy to show the need to identify a cause:
isolation of the micro-organism, obtention of a pure culture and re-inoculation into a
different organism. However, the use of liquid media made it difficult for Pasteur to isolate
pure cultures, whereas Koch used solid gelose media. Koch stated his famous "postulates"
in his 1882 publications on tuberculosis and anthrax.80
Animal experimentation assumed that there were phenomena which were common to
both humans and animals.8' It also presupposed that the live being was available for
experimentation and the increase of knowledge. However, endocarditis is not a disease
which can be transmitted from one person to the next and the question of the point of entry
remained unsolved. As for animals used in laboratory experiments, the injection of
pathogenic bacteria did not seem to be sufficient to reproduce the valvular lesions of the
disease.
Experimental Endocarditis
In 1878, Ottomar Rosenbach (1851-1907) of Breslau, and a student of Julius
Cohnheim, examined the possibility of reproducing endocarditis in animals as well as the
likely after-effects.82 In the introduction to his article, Rosenbach cited Magendie for
experimental physiology and Bouillaud for his work on endocarditis. Rosenbach's work
was inspired by techniques developed by Otto Becker, Cohnheim and, in particular, Edwin
Klebs' study of the surgical wounds of the heart valves and their after-effects.83 Klebs,
who would admit to the infectious nature of endocarditis two years later, had developed
experimental surgical techniques with the main objective of studying the circulatory
consequences of valvular insufficiency. However, it was Rosenbach, not Klebs, who
would combine experimental physiology with experimental infection thereby establishing
the first endocarditis animal model.84
He mechanically induced an injury in a rabbit's aortic valves by pushing a stylet into
the carotid artery straight through to the left ventricle. When the instrument was aseptic,
at autopsy the perforation was either still visible or healed but there was no trace of

infective endocarditis. However, when the instrument was covered with septic matter,
vegetations and fibrinous deposits, which in turn produced septic embolisms, were formed
around the wound.
Experimental endocarditis, therefore, resulted from the combination of the model
elaborated by Klebs, himself inspired by the "Bemardian" animal model of experimental
physiology,85 and the "infectious" animal model which was injected with a micro￾organism in order to observe how an infectious disease was transmitted. Separately, the
methods were ineffective but together they produced efficient results. Indeed, the injection
of pathogenic germs into the blood was not sufficient to produce the disease. Only certain
bacteria seemed able to be grafted onto the valves. The valves, for their part, had to be
damaged, just slightly, for the bacterial graft to be possible. Damage to the valves alone
was not enough to induce infective endocarditis.
Rosenbach's experiments were repeated by Johannes Orth,86 then by Vladimir
Wyssokowitsch (1854-1912). The latter, of the University of Kharkov, went to Gottingen
to study pathology under Orth's supervision.87 In their experimental model, once the
valvular lesion was produced following Rosenbach's technique, they injected cultures of
specific bacteria into the vein of a rabbit's ear (following Winge's theory). They concluded
that after inducing the preliminary lesion in the heart valves, it was possible to produce
infective endocarditis by introducing different species of bacteria into the blood-stream.
They pointed out, however, that without the preliminary lesion on the valves, the results
were negative.88 Orth went so far as to admit that, in humans, infective endocarditis was
always "grafted" onto a previous lesion on the valves.
That same year, 1886, in France, Netter studied "pneumonic" endocarditis.89 The
incriminated germ was tracked from the pulmonary lesion, the point of entry, to the blood,
while the patient was alive, and to the valvular lesions after death. The diplococcus of
Talamon and Fraenkel, of which the pathogenic effect on animals is well known, was
found in the endocarditic vegetations of the patient. Bacterial cultures from "pneumonic
juice" samples, blood samples and vegetations revealed the presence of the same germ.
After inoculation of the rabbit, pure cultures facilitated the production of a "general
infection", pleuro-pneumonia, or endocarditis occurring after the preliminary lesion of the
valves. In this last case, Netter induced traumatism in the rabbit's heart following
Rosenbach's method.
In discussing the mechanism of the infection, Netter pointed out that during the course
of some types of pneumonia,
the germs may enter the blood and then be deposited in different organs and, if the conditions are
favourable, will develop in a new way possibly leading to endocarditis. There are two types of

Towards a History ofInfective Endocarditis
causes in the aetiology of this disease: those which facilitate the spread of germs and those which
cause the germs to become embedded into the endocardium. The second case is easy to imagine. All
we need to do is to think back to our recent experiments in which we were able to produce
endocarditis whenever we damaged the inner membrane of the heart.90
Work was also conducted in Austria. Anton Weichselbaum (1845-1930) was professor of
Histopathology and Bacteriology at the University of Vienna. Bacteriology was, therefore,
an emerging science officially recognized even then at that university. Two years before
isolating the meningococcus, he published a study on the aetiology of acute endocarditis.91
After citing Orth's work, he recalled the distinction made between acute and chronic
endocarditis which were further divided into an ulcerative (diphtherial) form and a
vegetative (rheumatic) form. He pointed out that, for many researchers, the aetiology of
these different forms was due to micro-organisms and he referred to the research carried out
by Klebs and Koester, in particular.92 Noting that the results of tests were not always clear
in the case of acute endocarditis, he suggested that both clinical and experimental cases be
used. In the cases reported, often preceded by acute rheumatoid arthritis, Weichselbaum
prepared no blood culture while the patients were alive, unlike his French counterparts, but
took samples of vegetation and of organs at autopsy, then put these in cultures. The sampling
technique improved; he used Pravaz's syriuige and the agar-agar dishes. He found bacteria in
all cases, in particular Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Experimental
endocarditis was carried out on rabbits using Rosenbach's technique. The following day,
they were injected intravenously (as Wyssokowitsch had done) with bacteria from the
cultures of the samples taken at autopsy. Weichselbaum also concluded that, in order to
produce experimental endocarditis, it was necessary to have a previous valvular lesion, as
the injection of bacteria without prior traumatism was not enough to induce the disease.
When he examined the vegetations under the microscope, he saw the cocci close to the
surface and therefore concluded that the micro-organisms reached the valves through the
blood circulating in the heart cavity and not via the small blood vessels inside the valves as
Koester had proposed. Furthermore, after conducting several tests, he concluded that only
certain types of bacteria were likely to adhere to the valves, notably the streptococcus and
the staphylococcus. He questioned the negative results of the search for bacteria in the
vegetations of certain types of endocarditis and believed that it was difficult to give a precise
explanation as the germ could have died before or during the cultures.

The tests carried out on the experimental endocarditis animal model helped
significantly to deepen the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the
disease subsequent to Winge's theory formulated in 1869.
Complex Disease
The idea that the same germ did not always provoke the same disease was reiterated by
Emile Duclaux during the lectures he gave at the Sorbonne between 1885 and 1886.93
Similarly, different types of bacteria could produce the same disease. This departed
somewhat from the first idea of the existence of a specific germ. Unlike tuberculosis,
typhoid, syphilis, the plague, cholera, etc., certain infectious diseases could be caused by
a number of. different bacteria. This was first recognized in the case of pneumonia,
pleurisy, meningitis, angina, septicaemia and endocarditis. This, then, was the reason for
bacteriological diagnoses based on samples taken from the bodies of patients. Research on
blood cultures continued alongside clinical and experimental work. The development of
these techniques, often forgotten in the face of clinical advances, was very important. In
the case of endocarditis and the process leading up to the illness, blood culture was
essential from a diagnostic point of view. A von Eiselsberg, a Viennese researcher who
studied the presence of germs in the blood between 1886 and 1890, was convinced that
blood culture was an effective diagnostic tool.94
However, the fact that there could be several causative bacteria posed problems for a
number of doctors. The cause of preliminary valvular lesion was again the subject of
discussion. Was this caused by a germ? Was the germ specific? Doctors hesitated and
shifted from one position to another; the causes seemed complex and intertwining;
speculations were constantly being revised and no idea fully led to another. For Lion,
infective endocarditis, "first of all, a local disease subsequently generalized by the mixture
of vegetative matter with the blood, must be seen as an affection preceded by the
introduction of a germ into the blood-stream and thus must be considered a general
affection". The "terrain" and resistance to the illness were of foremost importance. The
question of the point of entry of the germs was not entirely clear, but Lion believed that
simple angina or a slight case of bronchitis could create this entry point.95 Meanwhile, for
most doctors, blood culture became an essential biological examination for diagnosis.
In practice, medicine was to see the mirage of a single cause disappear as it was
approached. Thus, in infective endocarditis, proof of the presence of a bacterial agent in
the blood was not a strong enough basis for a diagnosis. Nevertheless, when coupled with
other signs and symptoms such as fever, heart murmur, enlarged spleen and certain
peripheral lesions, blood culture aided diagnosis considerably. It would be some time
before this had consequences for therapy. It was necessary also to take into account the
virulence of the germ, its ability to lodge itself onto the endocardium, the "terrain" of the
patient, and especially the latter's medical history as the disease resulted from the
interplay of all these different factors. Previous heart attacks which were congenital or due
to acute rheumatoid arthritis certainly seemed to be important.

Towards a History ofInfective Endocarditis
At the same time, the contribution of bacteriology and experimental medicine made it
even harder to understand this disease. Consequently,, classification of endocarditis based
on different clinical forms seemed difficult at the outset. It was in the United States that
well documented studies would be conducted on a large number of patients. Extensive
clinical monographs were subsequently published.
V
Attempts at Classification
It would be fifteen to twenty years before a classification of endocarditis was
established which would temporarily gather together all the knowledge that had so far
been accumulated on the disease. The attempts at classification resulted from a clinical
rethinking of the affection in different forms as well as from improved knowledge of
bacterial aetiology. Different clinical forms were then related to different germs. It was
through combining the clinical and the bacteriological approaches that some sort of
typology was established. The clinical classification was, more or less, modified by the
bacteriological diagnosis through mutual construction.
"Acute" and "chronic" Endocarditis
One of the great endocarditis clinicians at the turn of the twentieth century, William
Osler (1849-1919) of the United States would lend his name to this disease; today we
speak of "Osler's endocarditis" and "Osler's nodules". Yet Osler did not formulate any
particularly original theory or make any important discovery. It was his ability for clinical
synthesis which was outstanding. As early as 1881, at a medical conference in Europe, he
expressed his views on endocarditis and supported the ideas of Klebs.96 He made
reference to the "spherical bodies" resembling micrococci, but these elements did not
explain the seriousness of the affection. He thought that the reason for the gravity of the
disease lay in the possible "debility" of the subjects.
A few years later, he gave a lecture on "malignant" endocarditis. The term is significant
and indicates the seriousness of the disease and the highly negative prognosis attached to
it. Osler briefly went over the work which had already been done, recalling Kirkes,
Charcot, Vulpian, Lancereaux and Virchow but without mentioning Bouillaud, Winge,
Netter or Grancher. He situated his work in a period where the relationship between
endocarditis and often associated diseases needed to be determined. That is, he tried to
dissociate endocarditis from a set of affections. He immediately pointed out the difficulty
of nomenclature and classification and suggested that the term "acute" be used for forms
characterized by vegetations and exudation on the surface of the endocardium with the
possibility of continuity or loss of substance, and the term "chronic" for cases where there
was slow sclerosed transformation ending in thickening, folding and deformation but no
vegetations. According to Osler, acute endocarditis was produced accidentally during

various infectious processes. However, complications arose very quickly. He made a
distinction between "simple" endocarditis and the "ulcerative, infectious malignant" type.
The latter could be "primitive", or "secondary" to acute rheumatoid arthritis, pneumonia
or various infectious fevers. He complicated things even further by mentioning two other
types of malignant endocarditis, namely the "septic" or "pyemic" type, similar to extreme
septicaemia, and the more frequent "typhoid" type with less irregular temperature and
early prostration.
The description of the endocarditic vegetation was, however, very precise:
It is made up of cells derived from the subendothelial layer ... which by their proliferation have
produced a small nodular proJection on the surface of the endocardium. . . . What part the
endothelium plays in this growth has not been determined.... there is deposited upon it a cap of
fibrine in the form of a granular, sometimes stratified, material, of variable thickness. Though this
resembles an ordinary coagulable exudation, it is probably deposited directly from the blood, and is
of the nature of a thrombus. Upon and in this layer may be found, sometimes in large numbers, those
remarkable little bodies ... which have of late become so prominent as the blood-plates [sic] of
Bizzozero, ... the connexion of which with fibrine formation has been so strongly insisted upon by
[this author].97
This was the first time that mention was made of the blood platelets associated with fibrin
in the vegetations and Osler confirmed the generally held opinion of the time that these
elements had their origin in the blood-stream and were not a secretion from the
endocarditic lesion. Osler added that there were numerous little granular bodies in the
fibrinous network which looked like micrococci. According to him, these micro￾organisms were best observed under the microscope after coloration with "Gramm"
(which he spelt with two "m's") and the germs detected were not always of the same type.
Osler outlined the major features of the "slow" type of endocarditis: previous valvular
lesion linked to acute rheumatoid arthritis or congenital valvular abnormality; irregular
and intermittent fever which, according to him, was a major symptom; sweating; heart
"murmur"; embolisms arising later; embolic process giving rise to certain manifestations
on the skin which often helped to replace uncertainty with a definite diagnosis or to correct
a clinical impression that was "off track". He admitted that these signs and symptoms,
except perhaps for the irregular and intermittent fever, had been described previously. He
claimed that the illness could be prolonged for three or four months. Osler then addressed
the question of diagnostic and aetiological difficulties more precisely but without
mentioning the blood culture: "Few diseases present greater difficulties in the way of
diagnosis than malignant endocarditis, difficulties which in many cases are practically
insurmountable". He then returned to rheumatism in the aetiology of endocarditis and
cited Bouillaud. He went on to discuss the progression of the disease where the local and
general effects were linked to the growth of bacteria on the heart valves and the
transportation of these bacteria away from the original point of affection. In conclusion,
Osler made a superb presentation of the "outlines of our ignorance"98 and enumerated
three points:

Towards a History ofInfective Endocarditis
In the first place, we do not yet know, with sufficient accuracy, the frequency of the occurrence of
microbes in simple endocarditis ... Secondly, we want full information of the various forms of
micro-organisms occurring in secondary endocarditis, and of their relation to the microbes assumed
to be the cause of the primary disease. And, thirdly, we are only at the threshold of inquiries relating
to the culture of these organisms, to the macroscopic characters of their growth, and to the possible
experimental production of endocarditis.
Osler showed his remarkable talent for clinical synthesis at these 1885 conferences but
did not seem to be very familiar with the practical bacteriological expertise which had
already been developed in France. He made no reference to the diagnostic importance of
blood culture or the work of Doleris, Netter and Grancher on this topic. He was also very
general and vague when, at the end of his conclusion, he mentioned the possibility of
reproducing experimental endocarditis.
Meanwhile, Sigismond Jaccoud was supplying additional information in France on
"slow" endocarditis, the insidiousness of the preliminary manifestations as well as their
successive stages of development.99 The term "infective endocarditis" proposed by
Grancher in 1884 seemed to have been adopted by some French doctors.100 The
importance of the "slow" forms was gradually confirmed.
In 1899, in Vienna, Hermann Lenhartz described types of endocarditis caused by
staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and gonococci.101 He believed that the acute
streptococcus type occurred in patients with general alteration, high and irregular
temperature and shivering, and was usually due to the "ordinary" streptococcus. On the
other hand, in the chronic type, the attack was gradual and the disease advanced more
slowly; there were usually petechias, infarctions of the spleen and of the kidneys and at
times cerebral complications such as aphasia and paralysis. The micro-organism detected
in the blood cultures of these patients was not the "ordinary" streptococcus, but a
"delicate" or "little" streptococcus characterized by slower growth and the absence of
virulence in the case of animals. This comparative description of the acute and chronic
forms of streptococcic endocarditis was clear and it would be interesting to compare it to
Osler's description.
In Munich, Hugo Schottmuller insisted on one bacteriological fact: when the "ordinary"
streptococcus was allowed to grow on blood agar, it provoked haemolysis whereas the
"little" streptococcus described by Lenhartz produced a greenish pigment as it grew. It is
for this reason that he named the latter Streptococcus mitior seu viridans. He underlined
the importance of this germ in the aetiology of chronic endocarditis and highlighted a
particular clinical entity which he called "endocarditis lenta" (slow endocarditis).102
Nearly thirty years after the first studies conducted by Doleris and Netter in Paris, Osler
finally noted the importance that blood culture103 could have for diagnosis: "With
carefully made blood-culture, one should now be able to determine the presence of the

septicaemia".104 His practical application of it seemed to be very recent as he mentioned
having used it for diagnosis on only the three newest patients in his series. Besides, it was
positive in only one case. Osler also pointed out that he had done vegetation cultures in
six out of ten cases; they were negative in three, the streptococcus was present in two, and
the staphylococcus in another. There therefore seemed to be a time-lag between his work
and that of the "Pasteurian" clinicians who had long been combining clinical examination
and bacteriological savoir-faire in the laboratory.
"Acute" and "subacute" Endocarditis
Shortly after Osler's work on chronic endocarditis, another study was published in the
United States-that of Emanuel Libman (1872-1946), a great specialist on the disease in
New York. Forty-three cases of "subacute" endocarditis were reported and several micro￾organisms isolated. The authors contrasted acute endocarditis, which was fatal within a
matter of days, with subacute endocarditis which could last from five to six weeks to a
year-and-a-half. From that point onwards, those two terms facilitated classification of
infective endocarditis in English-speaking countries. According to Libman and Celler, in
the case of subacute endocarditis there was always fever, sometimes low, other times high
and intermittent, with or without shivering. Once the disease had set in, there was regular
sweating. The patient got weaker and weaker and the spleen was generally palpable.105
"Osler's cutaneous nodules" (Kirkes had already described them in 1852) were
pathognomonic. It was Osler's name which would be given to the "subacute" form of
endocarditis, although it was Libman who proposed the term. Libman spoke of "Osler's
cutaneous nodules" whilst Osler referred to the "'nodosites cutanees ephemeres' of the
French" in his article written in 1909.1°6 The mystery of names ...
Blood cultures were done in thirty-six cases while the subjects were still alive. With
respect to these, Libman wrote: "It is noteworthy that in a few cases it was necessary to
make several cultures before a positive result was obtained". The question of
bacteriological diagnosis then became a veritable leitmotif. The germ found in thirty-five
cases was a small "atypical" non-haemolytic streptococcus which grew very slowly and
was not very pathogenic in mice. The authors referred to it as the "attenuated streptococci
of endocarditis".107 However, Libman and Celler disagreed with Schottmuiller that only
this micro-organism was specific to subacute endocarditis. In fact, they found an influenza
bacillus in one case and cited other cases where another germ had been found. In

conclusion, they stated that they had made 2,750 blood cultures since 1902 and had found
several types of germs in acute endocarditis (streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci,
etc.). According to them: "The absolute diagnosis must, for the present, rest on the cultural
study of the blood".108
By way of conclusion, the history of the illness of Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) gives a
clear picture of all the medical knowledge that existed on endocarditis at the beginning of
the twentieth century as well as the diagnostic methods and treatment advised. In 1907, a
"compensated mitral contraction" was diagnosed in Vienna.109 In February 1911, then in
New York, Gustav Mahler developed a sore throat. The following day, fever with sore
throat and angina were diagnosed. He seemed better for a few days but then the fever
returned, first very slightly, before becoming more intense and oscillating. This time the
patient was immobilized. At the beginning of March, his doctor, fearing endocarditis,
consulted Emanuel Libman. According to Dr Baehr, Libman's young associate at the time:
Libman clinically confirmed the diagnosis of a chronic mitral disease; having detected the
characteristic systolic-presystolic murmur in the precordium, prolonged mild fever, palpable spleen
and petechias. In order to confirm the diagnosis bacteriologically, Libman asked me to join him at
the patient's bedside, at his hospital with the necessary instruments and material for a bacterial
culture. Upon arrival, I took 200cc of blood from a vein in the arm using a syringe and a needle. I
poured some of this amount into several test tubes and mixed the rest with a medium of melted agar￾agar which I then poured into sterile petri dishes. After four to five days of incubation at the hospital
laboratory, the dishes were seen to contain numerous bacteria colonies and all the test tubes had a
culture of the same microbes which were identified as streptococcus viridans.110
A second blood test was done by a doctor at the Rockefeller Institute where serum had begun
to be prepared from the patient's blood. On 8 April Mahler set out for France and arrived a
week later. The French specialists contacted from New York were not in Paris (it was
Easter). Andre Chantemesse (1851-1919), of the Pasteur Institute, agreed to cut short his
vacation and immediately placed the patient in the clinic. On 20 April he decided to continue
the serum treatment. Chantemesse was optimistic that the treatment would work as long as
the heart resisted. He especially prescribed Metchnikoff's Bulgarian milk . . . On 25 April
the fever subsided and the patient generally improved. On 30th, Chantemesse made a new
blood culture and at the beginning of May he noticed that the streptococci were still growing.
However, Chantemesse continued to hope that his serum would manage to kill the germs.
Nevertheless, the disease progressed. On 9 May Mahler had pains around the heart and
several attacks of suffocation. Chantemesse noticed that the streptococci were present in

various parts of the body and that there was a swelling just above the knee. To counteract
that, he decided to apply sulphate and radium powder. The patient had to be injected with
morphine. Another doctor, Professor Chvostek of Trieste, told Mahler that he could help him
on condition that he took him to Vienna. However, at the same time, he told Alma Mahler
that there was little hope left for her husband. The musician died in Vienna on 18 May 1911
at the age of fifty-one. The Tenth Symphony was never completed.
Conclusion
Through this historical study of infective endocarditis, I have attempted to demonstrate
the evolution of medical knowledge: a blend of theory and practice.11' What Bouillaud
described as "endocarditis" in 1835 was redefined and "reframed" by each new
generation."2 This illustrates the restricting force of successive theories and how faith
was placed in each one, in its turn. Although a bacterial cause seemed to have been
identified, the problem of the cause of primitive lesions on the endocardium and the
question of "terrain" remained unsolved.
Identification of the multiple causative factors113 which are necessary for understanding
the disease, was sometimes jeopardized by the succession of mutually exclusive theories.
Doctors relied on different combinations of criteria, first clinical, then biological, so
complex was the disease and its causes. The clinician's logic looks at combinations and
chooses the criteria to be associated in order to construct a plausible scheme of causes. For
example, the collected data pointed towards acute and chronic endocarditis as two separate
entities caused by two different strains of bacteria. But this view would later be challenged
when other bacteria manifested themselves. Each time, these changing positions, hesitations
and "mistakes" added further to the accumulated knowledge. Canguilhem maintained that
medicine, like any other discipline, is built as much from errors as from truths; errors which
play a positive role often inseparable from that played by truth.114
Lastly, we have seen the concept of infective endocarditis reshaped over a century.
Different aspects of the disease were replaced and redefined according to the
preoccupations and tools which were specific to each period. However, some of
Bouillaud's questions and original theories are still relevant today, which should make us
re-evaluate the impact of the bacteriological revolution which has often been linked to the
emergence of modern medicine. Bacteriological science proposed new etiological
categories but, above all, it introduced new practical techniques.
The description of infective endocarditis has brought the old spectre of infections of the
pre-Pasteurian era into the present era of therapeutic optimism (antibiotics). The disease
unites archaism and modernity through the problems it expects bacteriology to resolve and
the sophistication it brings to microbiological techniques which have been tried and
proven in other diseases.
