ABSTRACT
Objectives: We assessed available data on impact of partial external biliary
diversion (PEBD) surgery on clinical outcomes in patients with progressive
familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).
Methods: We performed a systematic literature review (PubMed) and meta￾analysis to evaluate relationships between liver biochemistry parameters
(serum bile acids, bilirubin, and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and early
response (pruritus improvement) or long-term outcomes (need for liver
transplant) in patients with PFIC who underwent PEBD.
Results: Searches identified 175 publications before September 2018; 16 met
inclusion criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis examined
ability of liver biochemistry parameters to discriminate patients who
demonstrated early and long-term response to PEBD from those who did
not. Regarding pruritus improvement in 155 included patients in aggregate,
104 (67%) were responders, 14 (9%) had partial response, and 37 (24%) were
nonresponders. In ROC analyses of individual patient data, post-PEBD serum
concentration of bile acids, in particular, could discriminate responders from
nonresponders for pruritus improvement (area under the curve, 0.99;P< 0.0001;
n¼ 42); to a lesser extent, this was also true for bilirubin (0.87; P¼ 0.003;
n¼ 31), whereas ALT could not discriminate responders from nonresponders for
pruritus improvement (0.74; P¼ 0.06; n¼ 28). Reductions from pre-PEBD
values in serum bile acid concentration (0.89; P¼ 0.0003; n¼ 32) and bilirubin
(0.98; P¼ 0.002; n¼ 18) but not ALT (0.62; P¼ 0.46; n¼ 18) significantly
discriminated decreased aggregate need for liver transplant.
Conclusion: Changes in bile acids seem particularly useful in discriminating
early and long-term post-PEBD outcomes and may be potential biomarkers
of response to interruption of enterohepatic circulation in patients with PFIC.

What Is Known
 In progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, dis￾ruptions in bile acid transportation lead to progres￾sive and often life-threatening liver disease.  Surgical interventions include interruption of entero￾hepatic circulation via partial external biliary diversion.
What Is New
 In this meta-analysis, we evaluated relationships
between liver biochemistry parameters on the one
hand and early response (pruritus improvement) and
long-term outcomes (need for liver transplant) on the
other hand in patients with progressive familial intra￾hepatic cholestasis who underwent partial external
biliary diversion.  Our findings suggest that bile acids and bilirubin
levels may be useful as potential biomarkers in pre￾dicting both early response and long-term outcomes
after partial external biliary diversion.
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a family of
ultra-rare inherited disorders characterized by disrupted bile
homeostasis, debilitating pruritus, elevated serum bile acid levels,
and potentially fatal liver disease (1–6). Pathologies underlying PFIC

include deficiencies in familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 protein
(FIC1), bile salt export pump (BSEP), and multidrug resistance 3
protein (MDR3) (7).
Currently, there are no approved medical treatments for
patients with PFIC (1). Treatments used off-label for symptom
relief or to counter the detrimental effects of cholestasis include
fat-soluble vitamins, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholestyr￾amine, rifampicin, and antihistamines (8). Medical treatment,
however, often fails, necessitating surgical intervention (1).
Surgical approaches include strategies to interrupt the enterohe￾patic circulation, such as partial external biliary diversion
(PEBD), partial internal biliary diversion, ileal exclusion/bypass,
or gallbladder-colonic bypass, and, in the most severe/advanced
cases and/or upon failure of other treatments to sufficiently
relieve symptoms, liver transplantation (4,9,10). In PEBD, which
is commonly used in FIC1-deficient and BSEP-deficient PFIC
but is not a standard treatment for MDR3-deficient PFIC, a
jejunal conduit from the gallbladder to the abdominal wall
partially diverts bile to a permanent stoma (10). PEBD surgery,
if performed before advanced liver disease has developed,
reduces serum bile acids and pruritus and can improve long-term
outcomes in patients with PFIC (9,11). Some patients, however,
experience complications related to the external stoma (9,12),
and approximately 25% of patients with PFIC fail to respond to
PEBD (10). Understanding the relationships between laboratory
parameters and clinical responses/outcomes to therapeutic inter￾ventions would be valuable to assess whether potential biomark￾ers for short- or long-term outcomes would be useful for
evaluating new treatment approaches in patients with PFIC.
Unfortunately, available data are limited to small studies, case
reports, and case series.
Using data from published reports, this systematic literature
review and meta-analysis assessed whether liver biochemistry
parameters of serum bile acids, bilirubin, and alanine aminotrans￾ferase (ALT) could discriminate responders from nonresponders for
early responses (effect on pruritus) and long-term outcomes (death
or decreased aggregate need for liver transplant) in PFIC patients
who underwent PEBD.
METHODS
Literature Search
The systematic literature search included studies reporting
liver biochemistries and short- and long-term findings for patients
with PFIC who underwent PEBD surgery. We searched PubMed for
studies published before September 30, 2018 using the terms
‘‘biliary diversion’’ or ‘‘cholestasis.’’ Resulting publications were
searched for the following: ‘‘external bile/biliary diversion’’ and
‘‘PFIC,’’ ‘‘progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis,’’ or
‘‘Byler’s disease.’’ Other diagnoses (eg, Alagille syndrome, biliary
atresia) and procedures (eg, internal bile diversion, ileal bypass, or
ileal exclusion) were excluded. All studies reporting pre- and post￾PEBD liver biochemistry values (serum bile acids, bilirubin, and
ALT) and 1 short- or long-term clinical outcome were eligible for
inclusion in the meta-analysis. Publications that reported results
descriptively (eg, ‘‘lowering’’ or ‘‘normalization’’), without numer￾ical values, were excluded.
Meta-Analysis
The meta-analysis included all publications with extractable
individual patient data. Consistently available liver biochemistry
parameters are included in this report. It was assumed that the
term bilirubin meant total serum bilirubin. In addition, authors of
publications identified in the literature search were contacted to
determine if they were willing and able to contribute individual data
if only grouped data had been published.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (SAS1
version 9.4 [SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC] using PROC LOGISTIC)
was conducted to assess whether liver biochemistry parameters
could discriminate PFIC patients who demonstrated early and long￾term responses to PEBD from those who did not. ROC curves based
on liver biochemistry parameters were explored using post-PEBD
levels, absolute reductions, and relative reductions (expressed as
percentages, compared with pre-PEBD levels). The ability of each
parameter to distinguish PEBD responders and nonresponders was
assessed based on statistical significance of the area under the ROC
curve (AUC; null hypothesis: AUC ¼ 0.5).
Responses to PEBD surgery were defined as ‘‘pruritus
improvement’’ for early response and ‘‘decreased aggregate need
for liver transplant’’ for long-term response. Despite no consistent
definition for early response across all publications, pruritus
improvement was considered an early response as all publications
included pruritus improvement as at least part of the definition.
When early response was based on multiple measures, ‘‘partial
response’’ was defined as (at least) improvement in pruritus but not
in all measures. To dichotomize results for the ROC analysis, partial
responders were grouped with nonresponders. Long-term respond￾ers were defined as patients who did not receive liver transplant and/
or did not die in the period of the respective report. Nonresponders
were those who died or required liver transplant.
RESULTS
Literature Search
PubMed searches identified 175 publications (Fig. 1), of
which, 16 met eligibility criteria and included pre- and post-PEBD
liver biochemistry values and 1 clinical outcome in PFIC patients
(9,12–26). Of these, 1 publication was excluded as patient’s liver
biochemistry data could not be paired with clinical outcomes (26).
An additional article (11) was identified through review of an article
by the same authors (22) and was included as it provided additional
long-term liver biochemistry data. This yielded a total of 16
publications eligible for meta-analysis across 155 PFIC patients
(Fig. 1 and Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.-
com/MPG/B841). Median age at PEBD was 3 years (range:
5 months to 13 years). Reports included PFIC patients with defi￾ciencies in FIC1, BSEP, or MDR3; in many cases, underlying
genotypes conferring PFIC disease were not disclosed or evaluated.
Although not included in the original publication, individual liver
biochemistry data were provided by authors for 1 study (22) and
were used in the current analysis (along with individual patient data
from additional publications) in agreement with the authors and
with ethical approval.
Liver Biochemistry Parameters Before Partial
External Biliary Diversion
On the basis of aggregate and individual patient data, bile
acids, bilirubin, and/or ALT were variable and substantially ele￾vated before PEBD in patients with PFIC.
Bile Acid Levels Before Partial External Biliary
Diversion
For pre-PEBD bile acid levels, results were available in 13/
16 studies (142/155 patients). Across 6 studies (encompassing 100
patients with aggregate bile acid data), 3 reported pre-PEBD levels
as means (range, 249–307mmol/L) (13,14,17) and 3 reported

medians (range, 299–346mmol/L) (9,15,16) that were approxi￾mately 25 to 35 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) of
10mmol/L. Individual bile acid patient data were available for
42 patients across 7 studies (18,19,21–25) and were also elevated
before PEBD (median [quartile 1; quartile 3 (Q1; Q3)], 259 [195;
344] mmol/L; Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2A, http://
links.lww.com/MPG/B841).
Bilirubin Levels Before Partial External Biliary
Diversion
For pre-PEBD bilirubin levels, results were available in
13/16 studies (118/155 patients). In 6 studies with aggregate
bilirubin data (encompassing 87 patients), 4 reported pre-PEBD
levels as means (range, 8–75 mmol/L) (12–14,17) and 2 reported
medians (33 and 41 mmol/L) (9,16). Individual bilirubin patient
data were available for 31 patients across 7 studies (18–24).
Before PEBD, bilirubin was elevated well above the ULN
(median [Q1; Q3], 76 [41; 115] mmol/L; Figure, Supplemental
Digital Content 2B, http://links.lww.com/MPG/B841). In gen￾eral, pre-PEBD bilirubin levels were well above the ULN of
17 mmol/L.
Alanine Aminotransferase Levels Before Partial
External Biliary Diversion
For pre-PEBD ALT levels, results were available in 9/16
studies (82/155 patients). Across 4 studies with aggregate ALT data
(encompassing 54 patients), 2 reported ALT levels as means (38 and
96 U/L) (13,14) and 2 reported medians (60 and 75 U/L) (9,16).
Individual patient data were available for 28 patients across 5
studies (1 patient was excluded because of lack of baseline data)
(18–20,22,24). Before PEBD, ALT was elevated well above the
ULN of 35 U/L in patients >2 years of age (n ¼ 28; median

One publication that contained long-term outcomes but lacked liver
biochemistry data (11) was added because it was found to be a follow-up to an article already included in the literature search that included liver
biochemistry data for the same patients (22).

Partial External Biliary Diversion Surgery Early
Response
Post-PEBD follow-up times evaluating effects of PEBD on
pruritus ranged from 6 months to 3 years, although some publica￾tions reported pruritus improvement within days or weeks
(14,18,19,21). Overall, 104 patients (67%) had an early response
of pruritus improvement following PEBD, 14 (9%) showed a partial
response, and 37 (24%) patients were nonresponders.
Partial External Biliary Diversion Surgery Long￾term Response
For long-term response (decreased aggregate need for
liver transplant), 3 studies including 34 PFIC patients who
underwent PEBD reported individual patient data on liver bio￾chemistry parameters and long-term outcomes (11,24,25).
Median (range) follow-up duration was 2.5 (0.2–10) years in
the liver transplant group and 8 (0.5–13) years for those who did
not receive liver transplant. In patients who underwent PEBD, 13
(38%) of 34 needed a liver transplant and/or died during follow￾up (nonresponders), and 21 (62%) did not receive liver transplant
(responders).
Relationship Between Liver Biochemistry
Parameters and Early Response
Relationships between liver biochemistry parameters (serum
bile acids, total serum bilirubin, and ALT) and early response of
pruritus improvement were examined using available individual
patient data.
Bile Acids/Early Response
Seven studies with individual patient bile acid data for 42
patients evaluated pruritus improvement post-PEBD (18,19,21–
25). Bile acid levels decreased in patients classified as responders
(median [Q1; Q3] percent change, 98 [99; 97]%; n ¼ 25),
partial responders (42 [72; 32]%; n ¼ 5), and nonresponders
(21 [32; 34]%; n ¼ 12); absolute post-PEBD bile acid levels
were generally lower in responders than partial or nonresponders
(Fig. 2A). In the ROC analysis, absolute post-PEBD bile acid levels
could discriminate PFIC patients with an early response (ie,
improved pruritus) from those with partial or no response (AUC
0.99; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2B and Table 1). Absolute reduction (AUC
0.79; P ¼ 0.0017) and percentage reduction (AUC 0.98;
P < 0.0001) in bile acids following PEBD also could discriminate
responders from partial and nonresponders (Table 1).
Bilirubin/Early Response
Seven studies with individual patient bilirubin data for 31
patients evaluated pruritus improvement post-PEBD (18–24). Bil￾irubin levels decreased in patients classified as responders (median
[Q1; Q3] percent change, 84 [93; 60]%; n ¼ 24), in 1 partial
responder (30%; n ¼ 1), and in nonresponders (19 [35; 41]%;
n ¼ 6); absolute post-PEBD bilirubin levels were generally lower in
responders than in partial or nonresponders (Fig. 2C). In the ROC
analysis, absolute post-PEBD bilirubin levels could discriminate
PFIC patients who demonstrated an early response of pruritus
improvement from those with partial or no response (AUC 0.87;
P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 2D and Table 1). Absolute reduction (AUC 0.77;
P ¼ 0.0335) and percentage reduction (AUC 0.83; P ¼ 0.007) in
bilirubin levels following PEBD also could discriminate responders
from partial and nonresponders (Table 1).
Alanine Aminotransferase/Early Response
Five studies with individual patient ALT data for 28 patients
evaluated pruritus improvement post-PEBD (18–20,22,24). ALT
levels decreased in patients classified as responders (median
[Q1; Q3] percent change, 51 [75; 29]%; n ¼ 21) and in non￾responders (28 [46; 10]%; n ¼ 6), with a small increase in
1 patient classified as a partial responder (þ4%; n ¼ 1). Absolute
post-PEBD ALT levels were generally lower in responders than in
nonresponders (Fig. 2E), but they did not significantly discriminate
responders from partial and nonresponders in the ROC analysis
(AUC 0.74; P ¼ 0.06; Fig. 2F). Likewise, absolute ALT reduction
(AUC 0.59; P ¼ 0.47) and percentage reduction (AUC 0.61;
P ¼ 0.38) did not significantly discriminate responders from partial
and nonresponders (Table 1).
Relationship Between Liver Biochemistry
Parameters and Long-term Response
Relationships between serum bile acids, total serum biliru￾bin, and ALT and long-term response of need for liver transplant
were examined using available individual patient data.
Bile Acids/Long-term Response
Among 32 patients with available bile acid and long-term
response data from 3 studies (11,24,25), 20 did not require liver
transplant (responders) and 12 required liver transplant or died
despite PEBD (nonresponders) (Fig. 3A). Median (Q1; Q3) post￾PEBD bile acid levels were 6 (4; 155) mmol/L (normalized in 12
patients) in responders and 258 (163; 298) mmol/L in nonrespon￾ders, representing median (Q1; Q3) percent changes of 98 (99;
51)% and 28 (50; 17)%, respectively. This suggested that
lower post-PEBD bile acid levels are found in responders than in
nonresponders (Fig. 3A). In the ROC analysis, absolute post-PEBD
bile acid levels could discriminate patients who demonstrated a
long-term response to PEBD (ie, those who did not require liver
transplant) from those who required liver transplant or died despite
PEBD (AUC 0.89; P ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 3B) as did percentage reduction
(AUC 0.83; P ¼ 0.002) but not absolute reduction (Table 1).
Bilirubin/Long-term Response
Among the 18 patients with available bilirubin and long-term
response data from 2 studies (11,24), 13 did not require liver
transplant (responders) and 5 required liver transplant despite
PEBD (nonresponders) (Fig. 3C). Median (Q1; Q3) post-PEBD
bilirubin levels were 9 (8; 13) mmol/L in responders and 77 (77;
118) mmol/L in nonresponders, representing median (Q1; Q3)
percent changes of 92 (93; 80)% and 33 (35; 4)%,
respectively. This suggested that in responders, post-PEBD biliru￾bin levels are lower than in nonresponders (Fig. 3C). In the ROC
analysis, absolute post-PEBD bilirubin levels could discriminate
patients who did not require liver transplant from those who did
despite PEBD (AUC 0.98; P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 3D) as did absolute
reduction (AUC 0.83; P ¼ 0.03) and percentage reduction (AUC
0.88; P ¼ 0.02; Table 1).

Alanine Aminotransferase/Long-term Response
Among 18 patients with available ALT and long-term
response data (11,24), 13 did not undergo liver transplant (respond￾ers) and 5 underwent liver transplant despite PEBD (nonresponders)
(Fig. 3E). Median (Q1; Q3) post-PEBD ALT levels were 80 (30;
122) U/L in responders (a reduction from pre-PEBD levels of 146
[58; 209] U/L) and 83 (68; 171) U/L in nonresponders (a reduction
from pre-PEBD levels of 112 [52; 190] U/L), representing median
(Q1; Q3) percent changes of 51 (75; 4)% and 10 (26; 15)%,
respectively (Fig. 3E). In the ROC analysis of ALT levels, absolute
post-PEBD (AUC 0.62; P ¼ 0.46; Fig. 3F), absolute change (AUC
0.68; P ¼ 0.26), and percentage change (AUC 0.68; P ¼ 0.26) did
not discriminate patients with a long-term response to PEBD from
nonresponders (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
This systematic literature review and meta-analysis assessed
available data on the impact of PEBD surgery on early and long￾term outcomes in patients with PFIC. Our analyses indicate that
PEBD reduces serum concentrations of bile acids and bilirubin, and
that post-PEBD bile acid and bilirubin levels can discriminate
responders from nonresponders for both early responses (effect
on pruritus) and long-term outcomes (aggregate need for liver

transplant); post-PEBD ALT levels did not have this discriminatory
ability. Our findings suggest that bile acid and bilirubin levels may
be useful as potential biomarkers in predicting both early response
and long-term outcomes after PEBD.
Our findings that PEBD impacts liver biochemistry parameters
and pruritus are generally consistent with data from other recent
studies, although there may be some overlap between patients in our
study and those discussed below. A recent retrospective multicenter
study found that 81% (n¼ 17/21) of FIC1-deficient patients and 76%
(n¼ 26/34) of BSEP-deficient patients reported pruritus improve￾ment (partial or complete) after undergoing PEBD (27). Serum bile
acid and bilirubin levels also decreased significantly after PEBD. In a
retrospective analysis from the Childhood Liver Disease Research
Network (ChiLDReN) that included 34 patients with PFIC (FIC1
deficiency, n¼ 16; BSEP deficiency, n ¼ 18) (28), the proportion of
patients reporting pruritus was significantly reduced following PEBD
relative to presurgery values (65% vs 10% for FIC1-deficient
patients; 50% vs 20% for BSEP-deficient patients; both
P< 0.0001). There was also a trend toward reduced bile acid levels
in these patients. Total serum bilirubin decreased significantly in
FIC1-deficient patients but not in BSEP-deficient patients. No sig￾nificant changes in ALT were observed. Two of 12 FIC1-deficient
patients and 3 of 13 BSEP-deficient patients underwent liver trans￾plant following PEBD. Unfortunately, neither study (27,28) analyzed
relationships between bile acid or other serum parameter levels and
clinical outcomes.
A recent retrospective follow-up study from the NAPPED
(Natural Course and Prognosis of PFIC and Effect of Biliary
Diversion) consortium found that native liver survival was signifi￾cantly higher in BSEP-deficient patients who had undergone biliary
diversion surgery than in those who had not (29), and a significant
association was identified between lower postsurgical serum bile
acids and long-term native liver survival (30).
Although the long-term benefits of PEBD are established in
patients with PFIC, limitations such as need for a permanent stoma
have spurred exploration of alternative surgical methods, including
ileal exclusion and partial internal biliary diversion (8,16). At
present, only a few reports are available that describe long-term
results of these procedures, and the number of patients is low
(8,31,32). The ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) is a potential
therapeutic target in patients with PFIC as it mediates resorption
of 95% of intestinal bile acids (33,34), and IBAT inhibition
represents a novel medical approach to interrupt the enterohepatic
circulation. Our meta-analysis suggests that reductions in serum
bile acids following interruption of enterohepatic circulation via
PEBD can discriminate PFIC patients with pruritus improvement
versus those without improvement, which could be useful for
evaluating IBAT inhibitors like odevixibat (A4250) and maralix￾ibat. In a phase 2 study of children with cholestatic liver disease that
included 13 children with PFIC, reductions in serum bile acids
significantly correlated with reductions in pruritus following ode￾vixibat treatment (35). An interim analysis of a phase 2 study in
children with PFIC showed an overall trend toward reduced bile
acids and pruritus following maralixibat treatment (36).
Findings of our meta-analysis, together with studies describ￾ing interventions that interrupt enterohepatic circulation, such as
PEBD or IBAT inhibition, provide insight into relationships
between liver biochemistry parameters (eg, bile acids) and out￾comes (eg, pruritus improvement, need for liver transplant, death) in
children with intrahepatic cholestasis; future studies that better
define these relationships are warranted.
This study has some limitations, including a retrospective
design with limited access to raw and/or individual patient data. In
addition, there were no uniform definitions for patient selection
criteria or for early or long-term response based on validated rating
scales. Pruritus is difficult to quantify objectively as it involves
physical sensations and emotional responses; therefore, this analysis
utilized the responder categorization approach. Also, patients could
not be analyzed by PFIC subgroup because of lack of information,
including genotype data. Variability in surgical skill and experience
as well as varying surgical approaches to PEBD and criteria/indica￾tions for choosing liver transplant may have contributed to differ￾ences in outcomes. There is a potential bias for publishing successful
versus unsuccessful surgical reports. Finally, a relatively small
number of patients was included in some analysis subgroups, and
we cannot completely exclude the possibility that some patients
included in this analysis were present in duplicate across utilized
publications, as patient identities were not disclosed; this could
reduce the number of unique patients in the current analysis. We
also cannot exclude the possibility that additional studies fitting the
search criteria may have been identified in other databases, such as
EMBASE or the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.
Additional research is needed to confirm results of this meta-analysis,
including future studies investigating additional tools for evaluating
the effects of therapeutic interventions for PFIC.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis of PEBD outcomes in
patients with PFIC found that changes in bile acids and bilirubin
were potential biomarkers for predicting early and long-term out￾comes after PEBD. We speculate these parameters could also be
utilized prospectively to evaluate other surgical or pharmaceutical
approaches in these patients.
