Abstract. Background/Aim: Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
infection is still one of the serious health problems worldwide,
despite the existence of effective vaccines for HAV. Zinc
compounds have antiviral activities against various DNA and
RNA viruses. Therefore, we investigated the effects of zinc
compounds on the antiviral activity of interferon against HAV.
Materials and Methods: The effects of zinc compounds with
or without interferon on HAV genotype IIIA HA11-1299
replication were examined in human hepatoma Huh7 cells.
Cell viability was examined by the MTS assay. Inflammasome
associated gene expression was examined by real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Both zinc
sulfate and zinc chloride had an inhibitory effect on HAV
replication. Zinc sulfate tended to enhance while zinc chloride
significantly enhanced the anti-HAV effect induced by
interferon-alpha-2a. Zinc chloride significantly up-regulated
mitogen-activated protein kinase 12 (MAPK12) and down￾regulated 6 related genes [baculoviral IAP repeat containing
3 (BIRC3), interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), proline-serine-threonine
phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1), prostaglandin￾endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), PYD and CARD domain
containing (PYCARD), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)].
Conclusion: Zinc chloride inhibits HAV replication and has
additive effects on the anti-HAV activities of interferon.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a single-stranded, positive sense
RNA virus of ~7,600 nt in length. HAV is transmitted through
the fecal-oral route and usually causes self-limited acute
hepatitis, however, it occasionally leads to acute liver failure,
causing death or the requirement of liver transplantation (1).
Higher seroprevalence of anti-HAV antibodies reflects poorer
water sanitation and increased exposure during childhood in
developing countries (2). Sexual contact among men who
have sex with men (MSM), and blood transfusion are other
known transmission routes (3, 4).
HAV infection is the leading cause of pediatric acute liver
failure in Asian countries (5), although the use of the HAV
vaccine can prevent symptomatic hepatitis A, acute liver
failure is still caused by HAV infection, and liver
transplantation is required in many cases (6). Therefore, anti￾HAV drugs should be developed.
Zinc is the second most abundant trace metal, after iron,
in the human body (7). The global prevalence of zinc
deficiency is ~20%, with the majority occurring in
developing countries (8). Zinc deficiency is common in
developing countries as well as in Japan, which is a
developed country (7). We have previously demonstrated that
zinc sulfate inhibits HAV replication and upregulates
expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) (9).
In the human myelomonocytic lymphoma cell line U937,
zinc chloride increased interferon-α/β receptor 2 mRNA
levels by approximately 30%, compared to the control levels
(10). Zinc seems to directly inhibit picornaviral protease and
have an inhibitory effect on its polyprotein processing (6).
In the present study, we examined the effects of zinc
compounds on HAV replication and whether zinc compounds
could enhance the inhibitory effects of interferon on HAV
replication. The effects of zinc chloride on the
inflammasome associated signaling pathway in hepatocytes
were also investigated.

Materials and Methods
Cells and virus. The human hepatoma cell lines Huh7 and HepG2
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin G and 200 μg/ml streptomycin at
37˚C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 (9). The HAV genotype IIIA
HA11-1299 was established by Okamoto et al. and grown in cell
culture as described previously (11).
HAV infection. Approximately 1.0×105 Huh7 cells were placed on
6-well tissue culture plates (Iwaki Glass, Tokyo, Japan) 24 h prior
to infection. Huh7 cells were infected with 0.1 multiplicity of
infection (MOI) or 0.01 MOI HAV genotype IIIA HA11-1299 after
cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice.
After 24 h of infection, cells were washed with PBS and maintained
in 5% FCS DMEM with or without zinc chloride (Wako Pure
Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), zinc sulfate (Wako) and/or interferon￾alpha-2a (Sigma-Aldrich). After 96 h of infection, cellular RNA was
extracted for the determination of HAV RNA (Figure 1).
Isolation of RNA and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Total
cellular RNA was extracted after HAV infection, using a RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). To detect
HAV genome sequences, RNA, oligo dT primers and random
hexamers were used for cDNA synthesis using a PrimeScript RT
reagent kit (Perfect Real Time; Takara BIO, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan).
HAV-specific RNA was quantitated by real-time PCR using a sense
primer (5’-AGGCTACGGGTGAAACCTCTTAG-3’) and an antisense
primer (5’-GCCGCTGTTACCCTATCCAA-3’) with Power SYBR
Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA),
following the manufacturer’s protocol on a 7500 Fast real-time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems). The housekeeping gene β-actin-specific
RNA was also quantitated by real-time PCR using a sense primer (5’-
CAGCCATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGG-3’) and an antisense primer
(5’-AGGTCCAGACGCAGGATGGCATG-3’). Each real-time PCR
assay was performed in triplicate. PCR reaction was performed as
follows: 95˚C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95˚C for 15 sec
and 60˚C for 1 min. These data were analyzed by the ddCt method.
MTS assay. Approximately 1.0×103 cells were plated on 96 well
tissue culture plates (Iwaki Glass) with or without zinc chloride,
zinc sulfate or interferon-alpha-2a. After 72 h, MTS assays were
performed with the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). In brief, 20 μl
MTS solution were added per well to 100 μl of media containing
cells and left for 4 h at 37˚C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The
absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using an iMark Microplate
Absorbance Reader (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). Each assay was
performed at least in triplicate.
Examination of the effects of zinc chloride on inflammasome
associated signaling pathways in Huh7 cells infected with HAV.
Human hepatoma Huh7 cells were infected with 0.1 MOI HAV
genotype IIIA HA11-1299, and treated with or without 5 μM zinc
chloride at the same time. Medium with or without 5 μM zinc
chloride was exchanged on days 1, 3, 5. After 120 h of HAV
infection and treatment with or without 5 μM zinc chloride, cellular
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA
synthesis was performed using RT2 First Strand kit (Qiagen), on a
GeneAmp PCR system 5700 (Applied Biosystems).
Inflammasome associated signaling pathways were analyzed by an
RT2 Profiler PCR array (Qiagen) on a 7500 Fast real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Data were analyzed by the RT2 Profiler PCR array Data Analysis
software (Qiagen). Relative gene expression levels were normalized
to housekeeping genes by ddCt method (12). We considered significant
gene expression changes when the difference of gene expression was
more than 2-fold and p-Value was less than 0.05.
Statistical analysis. All data are shown as the mean±standard
deviation. Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t-test.
p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
Zinc chloride inhibits HAV replication. To examine the
cytotoxicity of zinc chloride and zinc sulfate, we performed
MTS assays after 72 h of treatment of Huh7 or HepG2 cells
with 0-20 μM zinc chloride or 0-20 μM zinc sulfate. Treatment
with 5 or 10 μM zinc chloride or zinc sulfate did not reduce
the viability of human hepatoma cell lines (Figure 2).
Next, we compared the antiviral activities of zinc chloride,
zinc sulfate and interferon-alpha-2a against HAV in Huh7
cells infected with 0.01 MOI HAV (Figures 1 and 3).

Phosphate-buffered saline; FCS: fetal calf serum; DMEM: Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium; IFN: interferon.

Seventy-two hours of treatment with 5 μM zinc chloride
suppressed HAV replication to 62.2% compared with the
untreated control. Of note, we did not observe an inhibitory
effect of 5 μM zinc sulfate on HAV replication (at 136%),
although we have previously reported that 10 μM zinc sulfate
had an inhibitory effect on HAV replication (reduced to
32.2%) (13). However, 72 h of treatment with 0.05 or 0.1
μg/ml interferon-alpha-2a suppressed HAV replication to 25.1
or 14.8%, respectively, compared with the untreated control.
We determined that zinc chloride inhibits HAV replication.
Suppression of HAV replication was stronger with the
combination of interferon plus zinc compounds than with
interferon alone. As interferon has also an antiviral effect
through the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISG)
and the degradation of RNA viruses (14), we evaluated the
anti-HAV activity of the combination of interferon plus zinc
compounds (Figure 4). We infected Huh7 cells with 0.01
MOI HAV, and the drugs were added 24 h later. After 72 h
of treatment with the drugs, cellular RNA was isolated, and
HAV RNA levels were measured by real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Suppression of HAV replication was stronger with the
combination of 0.05 μg/ml interferon-alpha-2a plus 5 μM
zinc chloride than with 0.05 μg/ml interferon-alpha-2a alone
[25.2±1.2 (%) vs. 20.2±1.9 (%); n=3, p<0.05] (Figure 4A).
Suppression of HAV replication tended to be stronger with
the combination of 0.05 μg/ml interferon-alpha-2a plus 5 μM
zinc sulfate than with 0.05 μg/ml interferon-alpha-2a alone
[25.2±1.2 (%) vs. 16.5±5.9 (%); n=3, p=0.067] (Figure 4B).
Thus, we demonstrated that zinc chloride could enhance the
inhibitory effect of interferon on HAV replication.

Zinc chloride affects inflammasome associated signaling
pathways in Huh7 cells infected with HAV. It has been
reported that nucleotide organization domain (NOD)-like
receptors (NLRs) can play a role in the host response to
HAV infection (15, 16). Therefore, we examined the
effects of 5 μM zinc chloride on the replication of HAV
genotype IIIA HA11-1299. We infected Huh7 cells with
0.1 MOI HAV and added 5 μM zinc chloride at the same
time. After 120 h of HAV infection and treatment with or
without 5 μM zinc chloride, cellular RNA was extracted,
and HAV RNA was measured by real-time RT-PCR. HAV
RNA levels were reduced to 75% in zinc chloride-treated
Huh7 cells, compared with those in zinc chloride-untreated
Huh7 cells.
It has recently been reported that chaperon-mediated
autophagy (CMA) is involved in hepatic immunity and liver
diseases, including acute-on-chronic liver failure (17-19).
Therefore, we examined the effects of zinc chloride on
human hepatic inflammasome associated signaling pathways.
We collected total RNAs from HAV-infected Huh7 cells that
were treated with or without zinc chloride to examine the
influence of zinc chloride on human inflammasome
associated pathways by using a real-time RT-PCR-based
array. Among 84 genes that were examined, one and six
genes, respectively, were significantly up-regulated and
down-regulated (2-fold more) by zinc chloride in HAV￾infected Huh7 cells (Figure 5 and Table I). Among them,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B)
were up-regulated in inflammatory cells of the liver after 3
weeks of HAV infection (20). HAV has been shown to up￾regulate TNF, leading to the induction of Th1 cytokines and
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response (21). TNF￾producing regulatory T cells (Treg) have been associated
with severe hepatitis A (22).
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that both zinc sulfate
and zinc chloride have an inhibitory effect on HAV
replication. We also showed that zinc sulfate tended to
enhance the anti-HAV effect induced by interferon-alpha-2a
and that zinc chloride enhanced the anti-HAV effect induced
by interferon-alpha-2a. Our results suggest that zinc chloride
may affect the inflammasome associated signaling pathway
in hepatocytes.
Activation of the interferon pathway promotes the
transcriptional induction of many interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs), resulting in antiviral, anticancer and
immunostimulatory status (23). Zinc chloride has been
shown to up-regulate interferon alpha/beta receptor 2 mRNA
levels (10), and to induce 2-5A synthetase (24). It has also
been shown to regulate double-stranded RNA-activated
protein kinase (PKR) (25) and to inhibit TNF-mediated
apoptosis through heat shock protein 70 (26). We also
demonstrated that zinc chloride inhibits the expression of
TNF mRNA in Huh7 cells (Table I). Zinc chloride has also
been shown to induce interferon-gamma-inducing factors
(27). In the present study, zinc chloride induced interferon
regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) (1.35-fold, p=0.005459),
compared with untreated Huh7 control. Thus, there may be
an association between zinc chloride and activation of
interferon signaling pathways.
Zinc compounds may have potential therapeutic effects on
patients infected with picornaviruses, including HAV (9, 28),

other positive sense RNA viruses, such as Sindbis virus,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis E virus
(HEV) (13, 29, 30), and DNA viruses, such as vaccinia virus
(31). Among picornaviruses, zinc chloride has been shown
to inhibit the replication of rhinovirus 2 (28) and destabilize
poliovirus capsid (32). Zinc chloride has also been shown to
inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and HEV RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) (13, 30). These antiviral effects of
zinc chloride may be through direct antiviral mechanisms or
indirect mechanisms through the interferon system.
Wei et al. have reported that zinc compounds do not
interfere with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) cell
binding but that zinc compounds mediate antiviral effects
through inhibition of viral entry or egress or the intracellular
phase of the viral life-cycle (33). In vitro experiments have
demonstrated that Zn2+ possesses antiviral activity through
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase (34). As HAV
also infects humans through the fecal-oral route, zinc may
prevent HAV infection (9).
In general, human blood concentration of zinc is 80-130
μg/dl and zinc and zinc acetate are prescribed at
concentrations of 34 mg daily and 150-250 mg daily,
respectively, for zinc deficiency (7, 35). We have previously
reported that 50-100 μM zinc sulfate only inhibited HAV
replication in a dose-dependent manner, and 500-1000 μM
zinc sulfate treatment for 48 h reduced viability of Huh7-
derived cell lines (9). In the present study, to examine the
effects of zinc compounds on antiviral activities against HAV

by interferon-alpha-2a, we used lower concentrations of zinc
chloride or zinc sulfate at ~20 μM or ~20 μM, respectively.
However, human blood concentration of interferon-alpha
is 10 pg/ml and pegylated interferon-alpha-2a are prescribed
at concentrations of 90-180 μg/body weekly, for chronic
hepatitis B (36). In the present study, to examine the effects
of zinc chloride on antiviral activities of interferon-alpha-2a
against HAV, we used 0.05 μg/ml interferon-alpha-2a in cell
culture medium for 96 h (Figure 2).
We also examined the effects of 0.05 μg/ml interferon￾alpha-2a with or without 5 μM zinc chloride on the replication
of HAV genotype IIIA HA11-1299 after serial passages in
Huh7 cells. In this experiment, we infected Huh7 cells with
0.1 MOI HAV and added the drugs at the same time. Serial
passages were performed as previously described (37). After
3 serial passages, HAV RNA disappeared from Huh7 cells
treated with interferon-alpha-2a alone or in combination.
It has been reported that the supernatant of Huh7-derived
cell line Huh-7.5 cells infected with noncytopathic HAV
HM175/p16 contain two populations of virus particles:
membrane-cloaked quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) and non￾enveloped virus (38). HAV cellular receptor 1 (HAVcr-1),
integrinβ and gangliosides have been candidates as HAV cell
surface or endosomal receptors (39, 40). One of the
limitations of our study is that we did not examine the effect
of zinc chloride on HAV RNA levels in conditioned medium.
Further studies are needed in this regard. The other limitation
of our study is that FCS contained zinc in the present study
although we used zinc-free medium.
Interferon and broad-spectrum non-specific antiviral
agents have been shown to be effective for the inhibition of
HAV replication (14). In this study, we showed that zinc
chloride inhibited HAV replication and enhanced the
antiviral activity induced by interferon. Zinc chloride may
affect the inflammasome-associated signaling pathway in
hepatocytes. Further studies are needed in order to explore
the effect of zinc chloride on inflammasome-associated
signaling.
