Introduction
Patients with acute and chronic liver disease frequently
acquire unique changes in haemodynamic and haemostatic
pathways that may result in life-threatening bleeding and
thrombosis. Additionally, activation of haemostatic path￾ways may play a role in disease progression through par￾enchymal extinction, organ atrophy, recruitment of
inflammatory cells and activation of stellate cells. In the
setting of a previously entrenched set of clinical perceptions,
the slowly evolving evidence-based paradigms of haemos￾tasis in cirrhosis are now more carefully scrutinized.
The 7th International Conference on Coagulation in Liver
Disease (held biennially since 2005) met in October of 2017
in Rome, Italy, to discuss and debate important topics in this
field. This document provides a statement-based thematic
summary of the meeting presented here amid a framework
of the most current evidence. The review of the literature,
preparation of the document and presentation of each
summary statement below are based on systematic
approaches used in published guidance documents.1
In particular, recognition of the potential disconnect
between existing evidence and actual practice, we utilized a
questionnaire and real-time poll of the conference attendees
to compare actual clinical practice to the evidence-based
support for each statement. The final section summarizes
the results of the most salient results of the poll.
Laboratory Testing of the Coagulation System in
Patients with Cirrhosis
1. Traditional coagulation measures, including pro-thrombin
time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), inter￾national normalized ratio (INR) and bleeding time (BT) do not
measure bleeding risk in cirrhosis.
Conventional in vitro tests of the coagulation system
are of limited value in estimating haemostatic compe￾tency in cirrhosis and current literature emphasizes these
limitations when compared with global assays of coagula￾tion.2–5 PT/INR, aPTT and BT are generally prolonged in
patients with cirrhosis in direct relationship to the degree
of hepatic decompensation. While useful for predicting
prognosis in chronic liver disease, these tests do not
predict bleeding or thrombosis in patients with chronic
liver disease.
For the PT/INR and aPTT, a trigger reagent (tissue factor
for extrinsic pathway or kaolin for the intrinsic pathway),

phospholipids and calcium are added to patient plasma in a
test tube and the time to the formation of fibrin is recorded.
The PT/INR test performs poorly in assessing coagulation
capacity in patients with liver disease6 and suffers from high
inter-laboratory variability.7,8 The PT/INR measures only
pro-thrombotic pathways without measuring counter-bal￾ancing anticoagulation (AC) pathways including protein C.
Numerous studies and clinical experience now clearly
demonstrate that these tests do not measure in vivo activity
of the coagulation system in cirrhosis.9–13
2. Platelet count alone provides an incomplete guide to
bleeding risk in cirrhosis. However, values below 50,000/μL
may be associated with higher risk of bleeding.
Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with advanced
cirrhosis and indirectly correlates with the degree of portal
hypertension and hepatic decompensation.14 In vitro evidence
indicates that platelet-dependent thrombin generation is pre￾served in patients with cirrhosis with platelet levels 56,000/μL
or greater.15 Notably, however, other important aspects of
platelet function are not assessed by thrombin generation assay
(TGA). Severe thrombocytopenia is associated with procedural￾related bleeding events in some, but not all studies.16,17 While
there is no evidence that prophylactic platelet transfusion
improves haemostatic potential,18 current guidelines and
expert opinion recommend consideration of platelet transfu￾sion prior to high-risk procedures or when active bleeding is
encountered in patients with platelet counts below 50,000/
μL.4,19 A notable exception is liver transplant surgery, in which
platelet counts below 50,000/μl are accepted by many centres.
3. Global viscoelastic tests (VETs) provide a more physiolo￾gic assessment of coagulation, VETs are not standardized in
patients with liver disease and do not appear to predict
bleeding or thrombosis. Application of VETs in patients with
liver disease remains controversial.
VETs measure clot strength and integrity in whole blood
under low shear conditions, attempting to more closely recre￾ate the environment in vivo during clot formation.20 VETs are
considered point-of-care tests and provide the clinician with
information regarding the kinetics of clot formation and
strength of the clot with the ability to distinguish contribu￾tions from fibrinogen, platelets and the fibrinolytic system.
VETs are most extensively studied in patients with cirrhosis
undergoing liver transplantation.20–39
More recently VETs have been employed to examine the
haemostatic system in a wide variety of patients with liver
disease, including well-compensated patients,40–42 patients
with acute liver failure43 and in acutely ill patients with
liver disease.44–46 A recent randomized control trial com￾pared transfusion-directed prophylactic therapy in patients
with cirrhosis undergoing procedures using VETs as a guide
versus standard coagulation tests.47 While significantly less
blood product was used in the group undergoing VETs
screening, the low rate of bleeding events, lack of control
arm and inclusion of relatively low risk procedures signifi￾cantly limits conclusions from these data.48 Specific nuan￾ces of VETs such as test performance without stimulators
(‘native’ VETs) and optimal duration of test remain uncer￾tain in cirrhosis.
4. TGA provides a more comprehensive assessment of the
haemostatic system in cirrhosis. However, the clinical utility of
TGA in patients with cirrhosis is unexplored with current use
confined mainly to research.
TGA is a valuable research tool that has led to important
insights in liver disease and coagulation.9–13,15,18,49–54 It
measures the rate of production and decay of thrombin after
introduction of a triggering agent (tissue factor and phospho￾lipid).55–58With the addition of thrombomodulin (required for
thrombin-mediated activation of protein C), the integrity of
the protein C anticoagulant system is measured. Tripodi et al
demonstrated that thrombin generation is preserved in cir￾rhosis despite prolonged conventional coagulation assays due
to decreased protein C.10,13Automation and standardization of
TGA is incomplete and clinical use is not currently available.
Efforts at standardization and development of a point-of-care
whole blood thrombin generation test are in progress with the
hope for future clinical utility.52,59,60
5. Available laboratory tests of hyperfibrinolysis are of
limited value in cirrhosis and clinical diagnosis is often neces￾sary (see also anti-fibrinolytic therapy below).
Identifying the presence of hyperfibrinolysis in cirrhosis
is challenging with limited clinically available and laboratory
testing.61–65 Reliance on clinical assessment and empiric
therapy are currently recommend (see the “Pre-Procedure
Prophylaxis and Treatment of Non-Portal Hypertension￾Related Bleeding in Patients with Cirrhosis” section).
The fibrinolytic system regulates clot remodelling and
breakdown and is likely rebalanced in cirrhosis. With
exogenous disruption (e.g. infection), hyperfibrinolysis, a
state of abnormal fibrin degradation mediated by plasmin,
can lead to delayed bleeding and has been a recognized
clinical feature of cirrhosis for over a century.66–74 Joist,
who coined the term ‘AICF’ or ‘accelerated intravascular
coagulation and fibrinolysis’, recognized the entity of bleed￾ing in cirrhosis similar to, but distinct, from disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).75 This condition was seen
in a clinical series where laboratory evidence of hyperfi￾brinolysis was detectable in a third of hospitalized cirrhosis
patients, but clinically evident in only 6% of patients.76
However, the divergent results of two key studies which
examined the mechanistic role of liver synthesized throm￾bin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor has resulted in on￾going controversy regarding the clinical significance of
AICF.61,62 These studies have failed to resolve the long
known and clinically evident occurrence of diffuse mucosal
bleeding or delayed post-procedure bleeding and efficacy
of anti-fibrinolytic therapy.71,77 On the other hand,
further laboratory-based studies have shown increased
fibrinolytic capacity in cirrhosis patients64 suggesting a
precariously balanced system more prone to clot lysis.
Both endotoxemia78 and ascites fluid egress into the sys￾temic circulation79 have been postulated as mechanisms of
increased clot lysis.

Pre-Procedure Prophylaxis and Treatment of
Non-Portal Hypertension-Related Bleeding in
Patients with Cirrhosis
Procedure-related bleeding is common in cirrhosis patients,
but estimates of incidence vary widely.16 For many years, the
PT/INR served as a surrogate marker for estimating bleeding
risk in cirrhosis. However, use of the INR and arbitrary ‘cut-offs’
as a clinical target is not recommended or supported by
scientific evidence. Nonetheless, medical-legal concerns have
dominated this field over scientific considerations for many
years. This situation is exacerbated by the limited connection
between the detached clinician performing the procedure and
the ordering provider. This issue likely contributed to early
termination of the well-conceived S.H.I.P. trial (Study of
Hemostasis and Invasive Procedures NCT00233246) which
did not enroll any patients. However, thefield has substantially
evolved since 2005.80 This now allows for more refined
recommendations based on recent data.
Assessment of individual patient characteristics is also
essential as clinical factors, such as acute kidney injury81 or
infection82 may alter bleeding risk in certain clinical scenar￾ios. Global tests, such as VETs, have offered particular insight
into potential pathophysiologic mechanism in patients with
cirrhosis and active bacterial infection where release of
endogenous heparinoids may contribute to an anticoagulant
effect placing patients at higher risk to bleed.83,84 Large
clinical studies examining bleeding outcomes are needed
to provide clinicians with better data to assess risk.
6. Pre-procedure testing of plasma fibrinogen and platelet
level is recommended for high-risk procedures (see ►Table 1)
and pre-procedure correction is recommended for high risk
procedures. Clinicians performing the procedure should define
the level of risk.
Single test assessments and even multi-parameter mea￾sures are unlikely to capture the nuances of a complicated
physiology. Nonetheless, there are data suggesting that
platelet level and the level of fibrinogen correlates to effec￾tive haemostasis, although it has not been established
whether correction of low levels actually reduces bleeding
risk.85 Evidence is very limited regarding any measure as a
guide to prophylactic measures and is mainly inferred from
bleeding risk associative studies. Again, many centres do not
correct low fibrinogen or platelets prior to liver transplanta￾tion, and a clinical trial has failed to demonstrate a beneficial
effect of pre-emptive fibrinogen supplementation.60 Despite
the limitations and lack of firm data, with our current
knowledge in the field, these parameters are currently
considered to be useful in predicting bleeding in cirrhosis
patients.
7. Routine prophylaxis for low or moderate risk procedures
(see ►Table 1) is generally not recommended. However, indi￾vidualized approaches are often necessary.
The most consistent finding with whole blood VETs (such
as thromboelastography or rotational thromboelastometry)
has been the demonstration of intact haemostatic mechan￾isms in cirrhosis with evidence that haemostatic support
with blood products is not required despite abnormal PT or
platelet count.86,87 Unfortunately, the majority of studies in
this field have lacked a placebo control arm which limits our
understanding of the overall baseline risk in patients without
prophylaxis. To this end, we conducted a poll to assess actual
current practice in potential contradistinction to rational￾based therapy—see below. The most important point to
remember is that prophylactic measures PT/INR can para￾doxically increase bleeding risk by engorging the collateral
bed without any haemostatic benefit. Greater recognition of
the baseline bleeding risk and the limitations of prediction,
by both clinicians that perform procedures and other clin￾icians, will improve patient outcomes.
Specific Therapeutic Agents
8. Platelet transfusion prior to high-risk procedures or with
active bleeding has a rational in vitro basis, but lacks high level
supportive data. Within the same limitations, thrombopoetin
agonists may have a role in pre-planned procedural
prophylaxis.

Conflicting data exists regarding bleeding risk and cirrho￾sis-related thrombocytopenia. The divergence in the literature
likely reflects the complexity of haemostasis in cirrhosis and
marked study design variation. Among patients undergoing
liver transplant evaluation, procedure-related bleeding in one
study was closely correlated to platelet levels < 75,000/µL.16
Similarly, bleeding risk was higher in a retrospective study of
cirrhosis patients undergoing dental extractions when plate￾lets were < 40,000/µL.88 Platelet levels < 30,000/µL were also
an independent predictor of major bleeding among critically
ill cirrhosis patients in the intensive care unit setting.89 On the
other hand, post-procedure bleeding in cirrhosis was not
predicted by baseline platelet levels in another prospective
study90 and the platelet-related risk of post-banding ulcer
bleeding has been variably reported.91,92 Compensatory
mechanisms which may alter overall platelet performance,
such as elevated von Willebrand factor (VWF),93 increased
circulating activated platelets94 and platelet-derived micro￾vesicles,95 may also be significant factors which balance the
bleeding risk related to thrombocytopenia. Additional factors
may also contribute to platelet physiology.96–98 Limited yield
of platelet infusion in cirrhosis is well known and raises the
question of whether platelet transfusion prior to high-risk
procedures is more ‘cosmetic’ to cover procedure-related
liability or an actual effective strategy—this is an understand￾able conundrum that remains unresolved. More definitive
studies require placebo-controlled trials which present clin￾ical investigators with almost insurmountable ethical hurdles
at the current state of the art.
In elective and planned settings, such as planned dental
extractions or other invasive procedures with moderate or
high risk, oral thrombopoetin agonists are an alternative
means to increase platelets prior to invasive procedures.
Concern for a transient hypercoagulable state due to throm￾bocytosis with eltrombopag, with early reports of increased
risk of portal vein thrombosis (PVT), have tempered enthu￾siasm for these agents.99–101 However, new agents are in
development, such as avatrombopag and lusutrombopag,
which appear to predictably raise platelets to a range asso￾ciated with improved thrombin production without appar￾ent increased thrombosis risk.102,103
9. The use of desmopressin in patients with cirrhosis lacks a
sound physiological basis and does not appear to significantly
alter risk of bleeding.
Desmopressin (1-deamino-8-arginine vasopressin or
DDAVP) has been shown to be as effective as human blood
products in cirrhosis patients undergoing dental extrac￾tions.104 Notably, bleeding was very infrequent in both
groups raising the question of actual efficacy and no control
arm without prophylaxis was studied. Other studies
show no benefit in variceal bleeding, liver biopsy in
dialysis patients with chronic hepatitis C and with partial
hepatectomy.105–107 A recent report further demonstrated
lack of significant pro-haemostatic effects in cirrhosis
patients receiving a conventional dose of intravenous DDAVP
compared with a control group of patients with haemophilia
A.108 These concerns raise the question again of the need for
placebo controls to more definitively define the utility of
various prophylactic strategies.
10. Fibrinogen replacement, pro-thrombin complex concen￾trates (PCC), and recombinant factor VIIa (rVIIa) may have a
role in treatment of significant bleeding in patients with
cirrhosis in specific clinical scenarios, but the utility of these
agents is undefined.
Fibrinogen replacement: The clearest data regarding fibri￾nogen replacement in clinical bleeding is associated with non￾cirrhosis conditions of severe trauma where fibrinogen levels
> 200 mg/dL are associated with more effective haemosta￾sis.109 Although based on very limited data, levels below
120 mg/dL in active bleeding patients with cirrhosis have
historically required correction. However, much remains to
belearned about fibrinogen replacement in cirrhosis.110 Repla￾cement has conventionally involved cryoprecipitate, a plasma￾derived product rich in VWF, fibrinogen and fibronectin, made
by freezing and slow thawing human plasma and reconstitut￾ing the precipitate in 10 to 20 mL plasma. In contrast, fibrino￾gen concentrates are derived from a similar cryoprecipitation
process of pooled plasma which then undergo isolation, viral
exclusion and lyophilization.111 The very low volume, standar￾dization of fibrinogen content and lack of need for cross
matching favour its use in cirrhosis. Recent in vitro data also
suggests a clear improvement in haemostasis in cirrhosis.112
However, further clinical studies are needed to justify the
expense which currently limits wider application.
PCC: PCC have been studied in cirrhosis sporadically for
over 40 years.113,114 However, recommended dosing is
linked to AC therapy as the dose is based on factor IX content
of the agent, INR (while on vitamin K antagonist [VKA]) and
body weight. Data are emerging that lower doses may be
effective in cirrhosis, but needs further study.112 A typical
dose is 25 to 30 units of factor IX per kilogram of body
weight. The low volume needed for VKA-treated patients is
attractive to avoid volume overload and collateral bed
engorgement in cirrhosis, however concerns over increasing
the risk of thrombosis remain.
rFVIIa: rFVIIa has mainly been studied in cirrhosis and
variceal bleeding. No definitive survival benefit was evident
in patients treated with rFVIIa as an adjunct in variceal
bleeding.115,116 However, the use of this agent as a rescue
agent in uncontrolled haemorrhage in cirrhosis remains
unsettled by randomized trials.117
11. In delayed and diffuse mucosal bleeding in decompen￾sated cirrhosis (hyperfibrinolysis physiology), consider use of
anti-fibrinolytic therapy.
Optimal treatment of patients with suspected hyperfibri￾nolysis lacks well-controlled prospective trials to delineate
risks and points of effective intervention. There are two avail￾able anti-fibrinolytics that block the lysine binding site on
plasminogen preventing its attachment to fibrin and subse￾quent activation: trans-p-aminomethyl-cyclohexane car￾boxylic acid or tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic
acid (EACA).118,119 Both agents can be given orally or intrave￾nously. Neither are felt to be significantly pro-thrombotic

based on studies in cardiac surgery of EACA versus placebo.120
Several points of caution include the possibility of thrombotic
issues if there is superimposed DIC, possible increased risk of
central line related thrombosis121 and the high concentration
of the agent excreted in urine. A third agent, aprotinin, is a
serine protease inhibitor that binds to plasmin to block its
activity and also blocks thrombin-induced platelet aggrega￾tion. The agent decreased the need for blood transfusion in
liver transplantation,122 but remained controversial in that
application123 and was associated with increased mortality in
cardiac surgery ultimately leading to marked restrictions in its
clinical availability.124
Diagnosis and Screening for Non-Tumoural Portal Vein
Thrombosis in Patients with Cirrhosis
12. Patients with advanced cirrhosis and low portal blood flow
(< 15 cm/s) are at the highest risk to develop portal or
splanchnic vein thrombosis.
The risk for PVT in cirrhosis parallels the severity of liver
disease and hepatic decompensation. The prevalence of PVT is
approximately 1% in compensated cirrhosis patients as opposed
to 8 to 25% in decompensated, liver transplant candidates,125,126
and up to 40% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC).124 Of the three pathophysiologic factors predisposing
to thromboembolism—slow blood flow, endothelial damage
and hypercoagulability, portal flow is the most influen￾tial.128,129 Portal vein (PV) blood flow is inversely related to
severity of liver disease as measured by the Child-Turcotte-Pugh
(CTP) score,130 and rates < 10 cm/s are associated with
increased mortality.131 Patients with underlying thrombophilia
are likely at increased risk for PVT, but inherited deficiencies in
natural anticoagulants can be difficult to detect in decompen￾sated cirrhosis.132 Emerging data suggest that cirrhosis aetiol￾ogy may also have predictive power in determining which
patients will develop future PVT. In particular, non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis may be an independent risk factor for clinically
significant thrombotic events, including PVT, in patients with
decompensated cirrhosis.133–135 The presence of a spontaneous
portosystemic shunt is an under-appreciated risk for PVT as a
result of a ‘steal’ syndrome and resulting PV stasis.136
13. Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension should
be screened for development of PVT every 6 months with
Doppler ultrasound (US).
In 2015, a systematic review concluded that PVT was
associated with poorer survival in patients with cirrhosis.137
Although hampered by heterogeneity, a recent meta-analysis
similarly showed that PVT was associated with more frequent
portal hypertension decompensation and higher mortality
rates.138 Furthermore, several studies indicate that PVT is
associated with poorer outcomes related to variceal bleed￾ing.139–141 However, a large, multi-centre trial of over 1,200
subjects utilizing screening US in CTP class A and B cirrhosis
demonstrated that PVT was not an independent predictor of
mortality or hepatic decompensation.142 Larger prospective
studies are needed to better delineate the effect of PVT on
patients with cirrhosis. As patients with cirrhosis should
undergo screening US for HCC every 6 months, assessment
of the PV can be performed simultaneously with Doppler US
without significant additional cost and is recommended.
14. Patients with cirrhosis listed for liver transplantation
should be screened at least every 6 months with Doppler US for
PVT.
In general, the pre-operative presence of higher grade PVT
leads to worse outcomes after liver transplanta￾tion.126,135,143–147 However, some studies suggest that the
presence of PVT may not necessarily alter the outcome for
patient survival.148,149 These studies are challenging to com￾pare due to the frequency of PVT in this population, selection
bias and multiple confounding factors. The ability of a surgeon
to establish a physiologic anastomosis for portal flow to the
graft is the most important factor in predicting outcome and
often related to the degree of thrombus burden.126,150,151
Detection of PVT prior to liver transplantation aids in
surgical planning and allows for potential pre-operative
therapy to re-canalize the PV. Detection of higher grade
PVT may identify patients that are not appropriate candi￾dates for transplantation. Re-canalization of the main PV is a
high priority in transplant eligible patients.143,151 As treat￾ment for PVT has a proportionally higher rate success early
after diagnosis, timely recognition and prompt treatment is
highly desirable (discussed below).
15. Patients with cirrhosis diagnosed with PVT by abdom￾inal Doppler US should be assessed with cross-sectional ima￾ging to confirm and stage the extent of thrombus.
While Doppler USis generally theinitial screeningmodality
to assess cirrhosis patients for PVT, it is limited by variation in
sensitivity and specificity due in part to operator technique
and experience.152,153 Despite this imprecision, Doppler US
has a high negative predictive value (98%).154 Contrast￾enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance
imaging have comparable sensitivity in verifying the presence
of PVT seen on Doppler US, and both are equally effective in
characterizing the extent of splanchnic involvement, evaluat￾ing for underlying malignancy and other sequelae.154–156
There are several systems of grading PVT severity, yet none
are widely adopted in clinical practice.150,157,158 To date, the
Yerdel system remains the most frequently utilized PVT
classification system in clinical research.150
16. Testing for acquired and inherited thrombophilia in cir￾rhosis can be considered in patients with PVT on an individual
basis, but universal screening is not currently recommended.
Inherited thrombophilia is reported in as many as 5.6% of
patients with cirrhosis and PVT.132 Several study cohorts
have demonstrated more frequent occurrence of the pro￾thrombin G20210A gene mutation in cirrhosis patients with
PVT.159,160 Additional hypercoagulable risk factors may
occur in patients with cirrhosis. The JAK2 V617F mutation
is found in increased prevalence in patients with cirrhosis
and PVT.161 When a myeloproliferative neoplasm is sus￾pected, consultation with a haematologist is recommended
for further testing. Inherited protein C, protein S or anti￾thrombin deficiencies may also predispose to PVT; however,
Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 118 No. 8/2018

these are difficult to detect due to co-existent liver synthetic
dysfunction.5,11,162
Treatment of Portal Vein Thrombosis in Patients with
Cirrhosis
17. Prior to AC, patients should be assessed for portal or
systemic bleeding risk.
Assessment of bleeding risk and benefit of therapy is
imperative when considering AC, but not yet well-defined
in this population. Contraindications to AC include recent
unexplained gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active alcohol
abuse and poor functional status due to fall risk. Severe
thrombocytopenia (< 50  109
/L) may be predictive of bleed￾ing events in cirrhosis patients treated with AC for PVT and
thus special consideration should be given to this particular
group.163 Prior to AC, patients should ideally undergo upper
endoscopy to assess for the presence of gastroesophageal
varices.164 If high-risk stigmata are found, endoscopic or
pharmacologic therapy with non-selective β blockade should
be utilized as per guideline recommendations.165,166
18. AC appears to be a safe and effective treatment strategy
in selected patients with compensated cirrhosis and splanchnic
vein thrombosis.
Safety: AC in patients with cirrhosis and splanchnic vein
thrombosis is an area of increasing interest in research.165–167
Several series examining AC in PVT are currently published,
the majority of which have been retrospective evaluating low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH), VKA and direct-acting
oral anti-coagulants (DOACs).126,163,168–179 Bleeding rates
among treated and non-treated patients are similar in these
highly selected patient populations.180,181 Rates of major
bleeding range from 5 to 20% and minor bleeding rates
range from 1 to 13%, but definitions of bleeding are not
uniform. A recent meta-analysis examined AC for patients
with cirrhosis and PVT and demonstrated a pooled bleeding
rate of all bleeding events (both major and minor) of 3.3%
for LMWH or VKA.182 Remarkably, the administration of AC
did not affect outcomes of upper GI bleeding events in
patients with cirrhosis.183 While overall bleeding rates
appear acceptable, it is important to note the high rate of
variability, the disparate outcome definitions and lack of
prospective randomized studies. Caution must be main￾tained when considering patients with cirrhosis for treat￾ment with AC, particularly in patients with more advanced
cirrhosis (CTP B and C). Multi-disciplinary approaches on a
case-by-case basis are needed.
Efficacy: Comparing studies examining the efficacy or
safety of AC is challenging secondary to the heterogeneity of
study design, patient population and variety of types of AC
used. In general, response rates are variable and range from 42
to 82% in terms of either a partial or a complete re-canalization
of the splanchnic veins.126,163,168–170,172–174,176 Factors asso￾ciated with successful therapy (re-canalization of the PV)
include recent time of onset, early initiation of AC (<
6 months) and the degree of thrombus burden (partial vs.
complete).163,184,185 Recurrence after discontinuing therapy
for PVT following clot resolution ranges from 27 to 38%.163,174
19. VKAs, LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants can be
considered for therapy in patients with compensated cirrhosis
(CTP class A and B).
Patients with cirrhosis are no longer considered auto￾anticoagulated and evidence clearly indicates risk of splanch￾nic and non-splanchnic thrombosis in this population. As
patients with known liver disease have been excluded from
clinical trials of these agents, current treatment paradigms
are based on data and experience in smaller studies in
cirrhosis populations.
Vitamin K antagonists: VKAs have been a cornerstone to
AC therapy over many years. VKAs act through inhibition of
vitamin K epoxide reductase which inhibits post-transla￾tional modification required for the function of factors II, VII,
IX, X, protein C and protein S. Patients with liver dysfunction
represent a particular challenge when using VKA as the INR is
often elevated secondary to hepatic dysfunction. Therefore,
determining the appropriate therapeutic target is proble￾matic. Moreover, use of VKA in patients listed for transplant
artificially inflates the MELD score and adversely affects
organ allocation. Reversal agents for VKA include adminis￾tration of vitamin K, FFP and PCC. Major advantages to VKA
include familiarity through extensive clinical use over
many years, low cost and oral formulation. Disadvantages
include unclear therapeutic goal in liver disease patients, the
requirement of routine monitoring with uncertain target
levels and an apparent increase in bleeding risk.186
Low molecular weight heparin: LMWH is a short chain
polysaccharide heparin which acts through anti-thrombin to
inhibit factor Xa and thus the production of thrombin. LMWH
is the most widely studied AC in patients with cirrhosis and
appears safe and effective for treatment of PVT. However,
studies in cirrhosis are generally small and retrospective
with variation in dose and inclusion/exclusion characteristics.
Expense and subcutaneous injections remain a significant
disadvantage to long-term use. Monitoring therapy of
LMWH to determine dosing efficacy is also controversial.
Anti-Xa assays are routinely used for hospitalized patients
on heparin-based AC; however, these assays can be misleading
in liver disease.181,187,188 TGA may offer a more reliable tool in
cirrhosis to determine efficacy; however, these are not widely
available.50 In vitro studies using TGA suggest that the anti￾coagulant effect of LMWH may be altered in patients with
cirrhosis.50,189 While no proven method for complete neutra￾lization of the anticoagulant effect of LMWH is known, partial
reversal of LMWH can be accomplishedwith protamine sulfate
administration in severe hemorrhage.190
Direct oral anticoagulants: DOACs act to directly inhibit
coagulation factors, factor IIa (dabigatran) and factor Xa (apix￾aban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban). DOACs are now routinely used
in patients without liver function impairment with favourable
safety and efficacy profiles. However, DOACs remain largely
investigational in patients with cirrhosis with experience
limited to in vitro studies and small case series.177,189,191–194
The largest series comparing DOAC to traditional AC shows
similar bleeding risks.195 In vitro data suggest that DOAC may
have variable effects in patients with cirrhosis depending on
the degree of hepatic decompensation present.188,189,192
Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 118 No. 8/2018
1496 Proceedings of the 7th International Coagulation in Liver Disease Conference Intagliata et al.

Notably, cirrhosis patients have been consistently excluded
from DOAC clinical trials and data on pharmacodynamics is
limited to in vitro studies with caution in CTP B and C cirrhosis
advised. Currently, in the United States only dabigatran has an
available direct reversal agent (idarucizumab).196,197 A recent
report demonstrated successful reversal of dabigatran prior to
liver transplantation without major bleeding or new throm￾bosis highlighting the practical use of this newly available
reversal agent.198 Clinical trials investigating andexanet α and
ciraparantag as reversal agents of factor Xa inhibitors are
awaiting potential approval.196,199 PCC may be considered
for emergent reversal in the setting of DOAC therapy; however,
the approach retains the possibility of inducing hypercoagul￾ability compared with direct reversal agents.200,201 Use of
DOAC in patients with cirrhosis should be restricted to well￾compensated patients (CTP A or B) with platelet count
> 50,000, and consultation with haematology is advised.
20. Liver transplant candidates with PVT should be con￾sidered for AC therapy. Non-transplant candidates may also
benefit.
The indication for treatment of acute and chronic PVT in
patients with cirrhosis remains controversial. The vast major￾ity of literature focuses on the natural history, outcome and
therapy of PVT in the context of liver transplantation.143,202
Studies outside of liver transplantation are limited and the
risks and benefits of AC therapy are more difficult to estimate.
Transplant population: Significant PVT (Yerdel Grade 2
and higher) is associated with higher morbidity and
mortality in patients undergoing liver transplanta￾tion.126,135,144–146,150,203 Maintaining physiologic blood
flow through the PV preferably via end-to-end anastomosis
is imperative.151 The ability to achieve physiologic inflow to
the graft is generally dependent on the extent of the PVT
prior to surgery. Patients with low grade PVT (Yerdel Grade
1) and non-occlusive branch PVT have similar outcomes
to patients without PVT. With more advanced thrombus
(Yerdel Grade 2 or higher) promoting re-canalization of the
main PVT or superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis prior
to transplantation is desirable. Liver transplant candidates
with occlusive main PVT with or without proximal extension
into the SMV should be prioritized for treatment with AC.
Non-transplant population: While prevention of PVT with
AC may delay hepatic decompensation,204 a recent study
suggests PVT is not related to liver disease progression.142
Patients with acute PVT can develop significant portal hyper￾tension complications and progression of thrombosis may be a
risk for intestinal ischemia or eventual cavernous transforma￾tion. Prospective trials are currently lacking; however, certain
patients may benefit from AC therapy for acute PVT, particu￾larly thosewith Yerdel Grade 2 PVTor higher where AC therapy
should be considered on an individual basis after careful
deliberation and multi-disciplinary review.
21. Trans-jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is
a potentially effective treatment of acute and chronic PVT in
patients with cirrhosis requiring treatment for significant
portal hypertension.
Historically, the presence of PVT in patients with cir￾rhosis was a contraindication for TIPS. However, more
recent experience suggests that TIPS is safe and effective
for the treatment of PVT when performed in the presence of
significant portal hypertension or symptomatic complete
occlusion of the main PV.205–207 Rates of re-canalization
are similar to reports from AC trials and range from 60 to
92% depending on the vascular access technique.208–210
Recent reports suggest that TIPS alone may be adequate
for re-canalization and no immediate chronic AC is
required to maintain stent patency.209–211 Patients with
chronic PVT considered potential transplant candidates
may also benefit from TIPS as reports are now emerging
of the successful use of TIPS in this population to re￾vascularize the portal venous system as a bridge to liver
transplantation.209,210,212
Venous Thromboembolic Disease in Patients with
Cirrhosis
22. Hospitalized medical patients with cirrhosis are at
increased risk for VTE.
Acutely ill medical patients are at risk of developing venous
thromboembolism (VTE) with an estimated rate of 4 to 15%.213
However, large cohort studies examining the incidence of VTE
and prophylactic/treatment trials with AC have generally
excluded patients with cirrhosis. Recent studies indicate that
patients with cirrhosis are at risk to develop VTE.214–222
Hospitalized patients with cirrhosis are likely at an increased
risk to develop VTE and studies indicate that thromboprophy￾laxis is under-utilized in this group.223–225
The Padua Prediction Score (PPS) was developed as a risk
assessment model to predict the likelihood of developing
VTE in hospitalized medical patients.226 Current guidelines
for prevention of VTE in non-surgical patients rely on the use
of the PPS to distinguish between low risk of VTE (score < 4)
and high risk of VTE (score > 4).227 The PPS has been studied
in a small retrospective cohort in patients with cirrhosis and
was shown to be predictive of development of VTE.223 The
IMPROVE risk assessment model was developed in a large
cohort of patients, which included patients with liver disease
and can accurately risk stratify patients in terms of throm￾bosis and bleeding risk.228
23. In high-risk hospitalized cirrhosis patients without
contraindication, medical thromboprophylaxis with LMWH
or unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be considered,
although efficacy remains uncertain.
Accurate risk assessment and use of VTE medical prophylaxis
is sub-optimal in hospitalized medical patients.229 Patients with
cirrhosis are often perceived to be at higher risk of bleeding and
likely do not receive appropriate medical VTE thromboprophy￾laxis.230 One study examined 75 patients hospitalized with
cirrhosis receiving LMWH for VTE prophylaxis and found rela￾tively low rates of bleeding (five patients with reported bleeding
events).231 Two large retrospective studies show that use of UFH
and LMWH appears safe with low in-hospital rates of bleed￾ing.224,225 Bleeding rates were not different between patients
with cirrhosis treated with prophylaxis (UFH or LMWH) (8.1%)
Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 118 No. 8/2018
Proceedings of the 7th International Coagulation in Liver Disease Conference Intagliata et al. 1497

compared with patients with cirrhosis not treated with prophy￾laxis (5.5%).225 Furthermore, LMWH was safer than UFH, with
decreased incidence of procedural-related bleeding.
While no current studies adequately assess efficacy for VTE
prophylaxis in the hospitalized cirrhosis population, prophy￾lactic LMWH was safe and prevented development of PVT in a
small prospective cohort of cirrhosis patients.204 Due to the
relative infrequency of VTE, properly powered studies in
hospitalized patients with cirrhosis will require large cohorts.
Consequently, current recommendations are limited to extra￾polation from studies in other populations without cirrhosis,
small retrospective cohorts and expert opinion.
24. Cirrhosis patients with peripheral VTE should be treated
with medical therapy with AC. LMWH, VKAs or direct oral
anticoagulants can be considered.
The majority of studies examining safety and efficacy in
therapeutic AC in patients with cirrhosis have been conducted
in patients with PVT (see the “Treatment of Portal Vein Throm￾bosisinPatientswithCirrhosis” section).Very few retrospective
studies have evaluated safety of therapeutic AC in patients with
cirrhosis with peripheral VTE. One early, small study examined
17 patients with cirrhosis and VTE treated with LMWH and
noted high bleeding rates on AC.232 Six of the 17 patients had a
major haemorrhage (defined as bleeding requiring blood trans￾fusion) onAC.However, from thisstudy the type ofbleeding, the
particular agent employed or the outcome of each patient was
unclear. Numerous studies since have shown the relative safety
of AC (LMWH, VKA and DOAC) at therapeutic dosing in patients
with cirrhosis treated for PVT, VTE and atrial fibrilla￾tion.126,141,193,195,231,233–236 In a recent study examining
patients with cirrhosis treated with DOAC versus traditional
AC (LMWH or VKA), 16 of the 39 patients were treated for
VTE.170 There was no difference between cohorts in bleeding
events (4/20, 20% in the DOAC group vs. 3/19, 16% in the
traditional AC group). A subsequent similar study compared
DOAC and traditionalAC forVTEin a total of 20 patients (8in the
traditional group and 12 in the DOAC group).236 Bleeding rates
were similar between groups (56% traditional vs. 30% DOAC).
Efficacy was not assessed in either study.
The safety of AC and dosing strategy in peripheral VTE can
likely be extrapolated from studies in PVT. However, the
efficacy of AC therapy in VTE in cirrhosis is not well studied
and the indications, timing of therapy and choice of agent are
inferred from general guidelines for treatment of VTE.237
25. Prior to starting AC, the bleeding risk should be re￾assessed with medical history and ideally an upper endoscopy.
If high-risk varices are present, consideration of medical or
endoscopic therapy is recommended prior to long-term AC.
See comments in the “Treatment of Portal Vein Throm￾bosis in Patients with Cirrhosis” section.
Survey of Concepts and Clinical Practice: Results of
Polling of the 2017 7th International Coagulation in
Liver Disease Conference Faculty and Participants
In recognition of the limitations of existing data and the
variation between evidence-based and actual practice, we
conducted both an interactive poll during the conference and
a more deliberative on-line poll of specific scenarios related
to the above statements. The polls were designed to address
actual clinical practices as they related to evidenced-based
concepts in this field. Among 150 attendees the overall poll
response rate was 80 (53%): among responders, 65% were
Table 2 Research goals: priorities and practicalities
Prophylaxis prior to procedures Pre-procedural fibrinogen level and platelets have emerged as important markers of
bleeding risk. However, prospective trials are now needed to confirm these markers and to
establish other potential predictors of bleeding
Global coagulation tests Future research is needed to better understand how to interpret and use global assays of
haemostasis, such as thrombin generation tests (TGA) and VETs (ROTEM and TEG) in
compensated and decompensated cirrhosis with a goal to establish standard references
within this population
PVT in cirrhosis In cirrhosis, PVT most clearly affects outcomes after liver transplantation. Studies are now
needed to examine the efficacy and risk of anticoagulation for the various grades of PVT in
all patients with cirrhosis (not just transplant eligible) with a focus on clinical outcomes. Key
aspects to study include incidence, risk factors, natural history, relationships to symptoms
and risks of therapy
PVT and disease progression Intra-hepatic activation of clotting and small vessel thrombosis in parenchymal extinction
may contribute to fibrosis and hepatic decompensation, but more robust studies
(translational and clinical studies in humans) are necessary
VTE prophylaxis in cirrhosis Prospective studies are needed to examine the utility of current risk models in cirrhosis
patients with a goal of improving knowledge of the incidence and natural history of VTE in
cirrhosis
Anticoagulants in cirrhosis The pharmacokinetics and dosing of all anti-coagulants (low molecular weight heparin,
vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants) in patients with compensated and
decompensated cirrhosis is poorly understood. Prospective studies are now needed to
better guide therapy with these medications

haepatologists, 10% were anesthesiologists and 7.5% were
haematologists.
Regarding all laboratory testing of coagulation indices,
agreement was modest for most statements. However,
agreement was strongest when surveying perception sur￾rounding the usefulness of traditional parameters of coagu￾lation (PT/aPTT/INR) in poorly predicting haemostasis (77%),
the hazard involved in rVIIa use (73%) and the lack of utility of
DDAVP in preventing or treating bleeding (69%). One of the
most interesting observations involved the necessity of pre￾procedure plasma fibrinogen and platelet count assessment
and correction: 68% of respondents agreed that these tests
are useful in high-risk procedures, but 69% felt that these
were not needed in low- or moderate-risk procedures.
VTE is a dynamic topic with numerous new develop￾ments. Most respondents agreed that hospitalized cirrho￾sis patients are at increased risk of VTE (84%), but less
agreed regarding the use of medical prophylaxis with
heparin agents (63%). There was strong agreement (91%)
that a peripheral VTE diagnosis warrants therapeutic AC.
There was strong agreement that endoscopic control of
varices was recommended prior to initiating therapeutic
AC (84%).
Regarding the diagnosis and treatment of splanchnic
vein thrombosis, agreement was generally very high
(greater than 75% for most statements). Most attendees
felt that cirrhosis patients should be screened with US every
6 months for PVT (75%), and that patients listed for liver
transplant should be assessed every 3 months (79%). Agree￾ment with pursuing confirmation of US results with a cross￾sectional imaging method prior to consideration of treat￾ment was nearly unanimous (91%). Results were mixed,
however, with regards to the utility of undertaking a
hypercoagulability workup (56% agreement), as many felt
it would not appreciably alter treatment decision-making in
terms of both choice of AC and also duration of therapy.
Attendees only had slightly more hesitation about treat￾ment of PVT (76%) with AC compared with peripheral DVT
(83%). Use of TIPS as a first-line modality to attempt to
achieve re-canalization of PVT was less popular with only
63% agreement.
Compared with the prior 2005 survey of actual practice and
opinion,5 this 2017 survey demonstrated greater agreement
on the limitations of conventional measures of bleeding risk
assessment using PT/aPTT/INR, but fell well short of a con￾sensus despite existing data. Health care providers are embra￾cing the concept of hypercoagulability in cirrhosis and more
willing to utilize therapeutic AC in the setting of peripheral
VTE and PVT. Furthermore, there is emerging consensus as to
the utility of fibrinogen and platelet measures as indicators of
bleeding risk prior to high-risk procedures. However, the
utility of more elaborate testing of hypercoagulable states,
such as genetic testing remain uncertain in the setting of
thrombotic complications in cirrhosis. Notably, in the general
population, a hypercoagulable work-up is currently discour￾aged in the majority of patients with VTE and avoiding these
tests in patients with VTE is on the ‘Choosing Wisely’ list
endorsed by multiple specialty societies.238
While significant gains in our understanding of the com￾plexities of the coagulation system in liver disease have been
made over the last several years, future focused research will
be essential to advance the field (►Table 2).
