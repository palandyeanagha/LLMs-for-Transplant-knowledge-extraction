Abstract
AIMS: To study the incidence and possible cause of abnormalities of
the subfoveal choriocapillaris after surgical excision of subfoveal
choroidal neovascularisation in age-related macular degeneration


(ARMD). METHODS: The postoperative fluorescein angiograms and
colour photographs of 29 eyes of 29 patients were reviewed after
surgical excision of subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation in
exudative ARMD. Preoperative and postoperative fluorescein
angiograms were examined for perfusion of the subfoveal
choriocapillaris. The excised subfoveal choroidal neovascular
membranes from eight eyes that demonstrated postoperative
abnormalities of the choriocapillaris were embedded in paraffin,
serially sectioned and examined for the presence of the
choriocapillaris. RESULTS: Postoperative fluorescein angiograms
revealed abnormal perfusion of the subfoveal choriocapillaris in 26
of the 29 eyes (90%) and in all eight eyes that had histopathological
examination of the surgical specimens. Examination of serial
sections demonstrated that none of the excised neovascular
membranes contained choriocapillaris. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal
perfusion of the subfoveal choriocapillaris was frequently present
following removal of the subfoveal neovascular membrane in
ARMD. The histopathological study demonstrated that
abnormalities of the choriocapillaris were not due to removal of the
choriocapillaris at the time of surgery.
