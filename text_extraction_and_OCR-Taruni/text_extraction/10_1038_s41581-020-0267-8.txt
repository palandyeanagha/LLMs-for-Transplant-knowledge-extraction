In aqueous solution, ammonia exists as ammonium 
hydroxide ions, which aid in maintaining acid–base 
homeostasis1,2

Hyperammonaemia is the excessive accumulation of 
ammonia in the blood, which can result in moderate to 
severe neurological impairment and cerebral oedema. 
Ammonia is produced by amino acid catabolism, the 
activity of glutamine dehydrogenase in the liver, kidney, 
pancreas and brain, and by the deamination of AMP 
during exercise in skeletal muscle1
. Most ammonia pro￾duced enters the urea cycle in hepatocytes, is excreted 
in the urine as urea or is converted into glutamine, a 
fraction of which is also excreted by the kidneys1,3
.
Typically, blood ammonia concentrations ≤35µmol/l 
(<60 µg/dl) are considered normal, whereas high 
concentrations can produce toxic effects and levels 
>200µmol/l (341µg/dl) are associated with poor neuro￾logical outcomes2
. The primary differential diagnosis 
of hyperammonaemia in infants and children relates to 
inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle dis￾orders (UCDs) and organic acidaemias2
. Toxic levels of 
ammonia can be due to either a primary or a secondary 
deficiency of the urea cycle. Congenital deficiency of any 
of the six enzymes within this cycle — N-​acetylglutamate 
synthase (NAGS), carbamoyl phosphate synthase I 
(CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), arginino￾succinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase 
(ASL) and arginase 1 — will result in a build-​up of both 
ammonia and the substrate of the specific enzyme4
. 
UCDs occur in ~1 in 35,000 births, among which OTC 
deficiency is the most common, with an incidence of 1 
in 56,500 births4
. Hyperammonaemia due to secondary 
inhibition of the urea cycle occurs in the context of other 
congenital metabolic abnormalities (such as organic 
acidaemias), following exposure to certain drugs (such as 
valproic acid) and in various liver diseases. Organic acid￾aemias, including methylmalonic acidaemia, propionic 
acidaemia, isovaleric acidaemia and multiple carboxylase 
deficiency occur in ~1 in 21,000 births and typically lead

Abstract | Hyperammonaemia in children can lead to grave consequences in the form of cerebral 
oedema, severe neurological impairment and even death. In infants and children, common 
causes of hyperammonaemia include urea cycle disorders or organic acidaemias. Few studies 
have assessed the role of extracorporeal therapies in the management of hyperammonaemia 
in neonates and children. Moreover, consensus guidelines are lacking for the use of non-kidney 
replacement therapy (NKRT) and kidney replacement therapies (KRTs, including peritoneal 
dialysis, continuous KRT, haemodialysis and hybrid therapy) to manage hyperammonaemia in 
neonates and children. Prompt treatment with KRT and/or NKRT, the choice of which depends 
on the ammonia concentrations and presenting symptoms of the patient, is crucial. This expert 
Consensus Statement presents recommendations for the management of hyperammonaemia 
requiring KRT in paediatric populations. Additional studies are required to strengthen these 
recommendations.

to mild to moderate hyperammonaemia due to com￾petitive inhibition of NAGS5–9
. Paediatric patients with 
acute liver or kidney injury are also susceptible to an 
accumulation of ammonia due to impaired metabolism 
and excretion processes, respectively2 (Fig. 1).
Hyperammonaemia is defined as >100 µmol/l 
(170µg/dl) in neonates or ≥50µmol/l (85µg/dl) in term 
infants, children and adolescents10. Individual labora￾tory reference intervals vary and some age dependency 
of ammonia levels is evident (that is, levels are higher 
in premature neonates). Early onset hyperammonaemia 
presents in neonates within the first few days of life after 
they start to feed and can no longer rely on maternal 
(placental) transport to appropriately eliminate the accu￾mulating ammonia2,4,7
. Symptoms in preterm neonates 
typically result from transient hyperammonaemia of 
the newborn, which is characterized by the absence 
of organic acidurias and normal activity of urea cycle 
enzymes. This subtype is usually associated with complete 
recovery, usually without needing treatment.
In hyperammonaemia, the acute rise in ammonia 
levels in the brain leads to increased levels of extracellu￾lar potassium and metabolism of ammonia to glutamine 
by astrocytes1,3,11. These changes result in increased 
intracellular osmolality, cerebral oedema and the release 
of inflammatory cytokines. High levels of extracellular 
potassium and glutamate released by astrocytes lead 
to neuronal damage1,3
. Elevated levels of glutamine, 
which is the end product of ammonia detoxification, 
is a key factor in both hepatic encephalopathy and 
ammonia-​related neurotoxicity12. Apart from hyperam￾monaemia, adverse effects on the nitric oxide pathway 
are also thought to lead to brain damage in patients with 
UCDs13. The clinical abnormalities observed vary for 
each specific UCD, but most patients tend to have simi￾lar symptoms14. The clinical features of an acute hyper￾ammonaemic episode depend on the age of the patient 
and the cause of the elevation in plasma ammonia levels. 
Early symptoms include lethargy, loss of appetite and 
vomiting. As ammonia levels rise, symptoms can pro￾gress to hyperventilation resulting in respiratory alka￾losis, hypotonia, ataxia, disorientation, seizures and, 
if untreated, coma and death15. Late-​onset hyperam￾monaemia in children, adolescents or adults can result 
from a partial or mild deficiency in a urea cycle enzyme 
that is exacerbated by certain stressors. Such children 
or adolescents present with failure to thrive, irritability, 
seizures, vomiting, ataxia and intellectual disabilities. 
Management of hyperammonaemia is challenging in 
paediatric populations given the non-​specific clinical 
symptoms, the age-​specific aetiologies and the lack of 
consensus in the treatment plan. Historically, the prog￾nosis in neonates with hyperammonaemia was poor, but 
current treatments, along with prompt identification 
of hyperammonaemia, have considerably improved 
the survival of affected neonates16 (Fig. 2), although 
updated survival data are not available.
This Consensus Statement presents guidelines for 
non-​kidney replacement therapy (NKRT) and kidney 
replacement therapy (KRT) of hyperammonaemia in 
paediatric patients. KRT includes peritoneal dialy￾sis (PD), haemodialysis (HD) and continuous kidney 
replacement therapy (CKRT). Varieties of CKRT include 
continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), con￾tinuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) 
and hybrid therapy. These guidelines and the included 
recommendations will be reviewed every 2 years.
Methods
The PCRRT workgroup. The PCRRT workgroup com￾prises an international expert panel of paediatric nephro￾logists from various professional societies representing 
a diverse paediatric population. The workgroup chair 
was T.B. (paediatric nephrologist, chair and founder of 
PCRRT). Co-​chairs were J.K.B. (clinical and biochemi￾cal geneticist, Department of Genetics and Genome 
Sciences, Associate Director of the Center for Human 
Genetics (Metabolism Section) and Section Medical 
Director, CIDEM Laboratory, University Hospitals 
Cleveland Medical Center) and R.R. (adult and paediatric 
nephrologist). The workgroup guidelines were discussed 
with international panellists at the Pediatric Critical Care 
Nephrology & Renal Replacement Therapy workshop 
(sponsored by PCRRT) on 11 April 2019. These experts 
met to discuss and develop recommendations for the 
management of paediatric hyperammonaemia with KRT. 
Further meetings were held at a consensus conference

biennial World Congress of Nephrology in Melbourne, 
Australia, 12–15 April 2019. The workgroup members all 
disclosed any conflicts of interest, and all participated in 
a careful review of the objectives, background, rationale 
and statistical methods used in this study.
The literature search, article review, data extraction 
and results were completed by the PCRRT co-​chairs, 
who submitted their results to the workgroup for dis￾cussion. All individuals were responsible for reviewing 
and proposing recommendations for KRT in children 
with hyperammonaemia. Disagreements between 
panel members were resolved by quantifying votes 
using the RAND Corporation/University of California 
Los Angeles (UCLA) appropriateness method and 
subsequently calculating a disagreement index17,18. 
The modified Delphi method was used to establish the 
strength of each recommendation. Grading of recom￾mendations, assessments, development, and evaluation 
(GRADE) criteria19 were used to establish the evidence 
level for each clinical recommendation.
Data selection and review. The PubMed/MEDLINE, 
EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched to 
identify publications relevant to hyperammonaemia and 
KRT in the paediatric population. Medical subject head￾ings (MeSH terms) used in the creation of the search 
strategy included “renal replacement therapy”, “renal 
dialysis*”, “kidney replacement”, “hemofiltration*”, 
“hemodialysis”, “dialysis”, “peritoneal dialysis”, “CAPD”, 
“hemodiafiltration*”, “hemoperfusion*” and “hyperam￾monemia*”. Asterisks denote terms that were expanded

Fig. 1 | Urea cycle dysfunction results in toxic accumulation of ammonia in the blood. Hyperammonaemia in neonates 
and infants is typically caused by inborn errors of metabolism. Primary urea cycle disorders are caused by congenital 
deficiency of any of the six urea cycle enzymes: N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), carbamoyl phosphate synthase I 
(CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and arginase 1 
(ARG1). These deficiencies result in severe hyperammonaemia and the accumulation of both urea and the substrate of the 
missing or defective enzyme. For example, the accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate (CP; dashed line) results in greatly 
increased production and excretion of orotate. Secondary inhibition of the urea cycle is caused by abnormalities that 
reduce the activity of other enzymes involved in amino acid processing. These deficiencies cause organic acidaemias, such 
as methylmalonic acidaemia, propionic acidaemia, isovaleric acidaemia and multiple carboxylase deficiency, as well as 
(typically mild to moderate) hyperammonaemia. Hyperammonaemia can also occur following exposure to drugs, such as 
valproic acid. Finally, paediatric patients with liver diseases or acute kidney injury are also susceptible to hyperammonaemia 
owing to impaired metabolism or excretion of urea, respectively68. αKG, α-ketoglutarate; AGC, aspartate–glutamate carrier;

to search all related terms on the familial hierarchy. The 
MeSH term “hyperammonemia” included narrower 
terms such as “urea cycle disorder”, “hyperlysinemia”, 
“hyperornithinemia”, “hyperammonemia and homocit￾rullinuria (HHH) syndrome”, “methylmalonic aciduria”, 
“CPS deficiency disease”, “OTC deficiency disease” and 
“propionic aciduria”. The search strategy was limited to 
patients aged 0–18 years. Supplementary Box 1 lists the 
full and specific search strategies used.
The initial database searches returned a total of 477 
citations. All citations obtained were reviewed by two 
independent reviewers. A PICO (patient, problem or 
population; intervention; comparison, control or com￾parator; outcomes) model table was constructed to 
illustrate the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1). 
Each title, abstract and full-​text article was assessed by 
two independent reviewers. To settle disputes and assess 
inter-​rater agreements, a third independent reviewer 
also assessed the articles. After removal of duplicates, 
329 citations remained, of which 118 were considered 
for full-​text review. Supplementary Table 1 shows the 
PRISMA statement checklist that was used in report￾ing the selected articles20. The Cochrane risk of bias 
assessment tool for randomized control trials and the 
Newcastle–Ottawa scales for cohort studies were used 
to assess the quality of the included studies21,22.
The workgroup considered data from 28 of these 
studies to be most relevant for formulating the guide￾lines. A total of 172 patients were included in these 
28 studies, with ages ranging from 1 day to 7 years. 
Hyperammonaemia was associated with a multi￾tude of aetiologies, the most common of which were 
inborn errors of metabolism. The most frequent inborn 
errors of metabolism were CPS deficiency (n = 16), 
propionic acidaemia (n =15) and methylmalonic aci￾daemia (n = 13). Indications for HD included hyper￾ammonaemia refractory to medical management and 
hyperammonaemic coma. Illness severity ranged from 
haemodynamically stable to hyperammonaemic coma. 
Dialysis duration ranged from 2h to 19 days. The success 
rates for each modality were 65% for PD (n=23), 100% 
for intermittent HD (n = 5), 60% for CKRT (n = 92),

Fig. 2 | Clinical manifestations of hyperammonaemia. The clinical features of an acute hyperammonaemic episode are 
influenced by the age of the patient and the underlying cause of hyperammonaemia — that is, the specific urea cycle 
enzyme deficiency or organic acidaemia. a | In neonates, early symptoms include lethargy, loss of appetite and vomiting. 
If ammonia levels continue to rise, symptoms progress to hypotonia and hyperventilation resulting in respiratory alkalosis. 
Severe hyperammonaemia is characterized by an acute encephalopathy, seizures, and, if untreated, coma and death. 
b | Late-onset hyperammonaemia (that is, in infants, children and adults) typically results from a partial or mild urea cycle 
enzyme deficiency exacerbated by exposure to stressors such as drug treatment. These individuals typically present 
with failure to thrive and abdominal symptoms, accompanied by psychiatric manifestations such as irritability, learning 
disabilities, delusion and psychosis. Patients might additionally have neurological symptoms, including neurodevelopmental 
delay, seizures and hemiplegia. The psychiatric and neurological manifestations of hyperammonaemia are attributable to 
increased brain levels of ammonia, which is metabolized to glutamine by astrocytes. The resulting high extracellular levels 
of potassium and glutamine cause increased intracellular osmolality and cerebral oedema, leading to neuronal damage and 
the release of inflammatory cytokines.

hyperammonaemia. The most pertinent data on patient 
characteristics, HD parameters and outcomes are sum￾marized in Table 2 (an expanded table is provided as 
Supplementary Table 2).
In the literature review, very few randomized con￾trolled trials and meta-​analyses were identified, and 
those identified were excluded from the scope of the 
present expert Consensus Statement on the basis of 
insufficient quality and a lack of pertinent information. 
All the recommendations were made on the basis of 
case reports and retrospective studies (Table 3). Clearly, 
high grades of evidence19 could not be provided based 
on case reports and retrospective studies describing a 
few, rare and scattered paediatric patients with hyper￾ammonaemia requiring dialysis. Yet, guidelines with 
low evidence grading can still be of immense value to 
clinicians while waiting for additional evidence. Another 
limitation of the study concerns the lack of consensus 
on the preferred modality for KRT, the type of dialyser, 
membrane and filtration rate; these parameters were 
all institution-​dependent and thus not generalizable. 
Indications for KRT were also variable; some stud￾ies initiated KRT at a certain ammonia level (typically 
>400μmol/l (681μg/dl)), whereas others initiated KRT 
when the patient was haemodynamically unstable, irre￾spective of the patient’s ammonia level. Future large-​scale 
studies are necessary to establish more specific guidelines 
for KRT in paediatric patients with hyperammonaemia.
Consensus panel recommendations
Prompt identification and treatment of hyperam￾monaemia are imperative to optimize the outcome of a 
hyperammonaemic crisis and to avoid irreversible brain 
damage.
Initial medical management guidelines. In the ini￾tial medical management of acute hyperammonae￾mia, the patient should be immediately stabilized 
(circulation, airway and breathing), vital signs should 
be addressed, blood glucose levels monitored, intra￾venous access should be established, airways should 
be maintained by intubation and ventilation if nec￾essary, and adequate rehydration should be started, 
typically using a dextrose-​containing fluid at a high 
infusion rate23. In patients in hyperammonaemic 
crisis, laboratory testing is required to establish the 
cause of hyperammonaemia24. Accurate measurement 
of plasma levels of ammonia is also important and 
should be performed on a free-​flowing venous 
or arterial blood sample collected into a lithium heparin or 
EDTA tube and transported on ice to the laboratory. The 
sample must be processed within 15 min of draw and 
analysed immediately.
Once hyperammonaemia is identified, protein intake 
must be temporarily stopped and plasma ammonia 
levels monitored every 3 h (ref.
10). In a patient with an 
ammonia level at the upper limit of normal for their 
age — that is, 110 μmol/l (154 μg/dl) at age 1–7 days, 
<90μmol/l (126μg/dl) at age 8–14 days and 16–53µmol/l 
(22–74 μg/dl) at age 15 days to adult — stopping pro￾tein intake and initiating intravenous glucose and 
lipids to prevent catabolism is generally adequate. 
Crucially, protein intake must be reintroduced within 
a maximum of 48 h following the return of ammonia 
levels to 80–100μmol/l (136–170μg/dl) in order to avoid 
catabolism23. Two factors determine the prognosis of 
neurological damage: the duration of hyperammonae￾mic coma and plasma ammonia levels25,26. Adverse 
prognostic factors include hyperammonaemic coma 
lasting >3 days, increased intracranial pressure and/or a 
plasma ammonia level >1,000μmol/l (1,703μg/dl)15. In 
a study of 22 children with UCDs who survived a hyper￾ammonaemic coma, the duration of coma was inversely 
correlated with the children’s IQ at 12 months after 
recovery from the hyperammonaemic coma27,28. The 
severity of abnormalities on brain CT also correlated 
with the duration of coma29. Early management and 
reduced duration of hyperammonaemic coma may pre￾vent adverse neurological outcomes29. The initial medi￾cal and nutritional management of hyperammonaemia 
is summarized in Box 1.
NKRT guidelines. NKRT is generally indicated at serum 
ammonia levels >150 μmol/l (255 μg/dl). The goal 
of NKRT is to provide an alternative route for nitro￾gen excretion (that is, its sequestration by nitrogen-​
scavenging agents)2
. Nitrogen scavengers include 
sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, sodium phenyl￾butyrate (a precursor of phenylacetate) and glycerol 
phenylbutyrate. Benzoate conjugates with glycine to 
generate hippurate, whereas phenylacetate conjugates 
with glutamine to generate phenylacetylglutamine23,30. 
Intravenous sodium benzoate and sodium phenyl￾acetate can often be administered much more rapidly 
than KRT. These agents can also be administered in con￾junction with KRT but will be dialysed along with other 
small molecules. Nonetheless, in one infant with hyper￾ammonaemia due to a suspected inborn error of meta￾bolism, the use of a cocktail of intravenous nitrogen 
scavengers followed by sequential HD and haemofil￾tration successfully corrected the hyperammonaemia 
despite rapid clearance of the nitrogen scavengers by 
dialysis31.
Additionally, urea cycle intermediates such as 
l-​arginine or l-​citrulline are primers of the urea cycle 
that can be supplemented to aid in ammonia removal. 
The choice of intermediate depends on which deficiency 
is present. l-​Arginine is also a precursor to nitric oxide, 
a potent vasodilator; intravenous administration of

arginine could therefore lead to hypotension. The argi￾nine dose might need to be titrated or reduced, espe￾cially if the patient is simultaneously receiving HD. In 
patients with ammonia levels >150 μmol/l (255 μg/dl), 
the protocol depends on the blood ammonia level and 
whether or not the patient has a known UCD. Treatment 
of hyperammonaemia based on the ammonia level in 
both undiagnosed patients and patients with known 
UCDs should be initiated according to the guidelines 
for NKRT management23,30. Box 2 presents the consensus 
panel’s recommendations for NKRT.
KRT guidelines. Ammonia is amenable to diffusive 
dialysis as it does not notably bind to albumin or other 
proteins and is a small molecule with a molecular weight 
of 17Da2
. Published indications for dialysis in neonates 
and children include serum ammonia level >500μmol/l 
(852 μg/dl) or a lower level if there is an inadequate 
clinical response after 4 h of medical management10,32. 
If serum levels of ammonia are 100–300 μmol/l 
(170–511μg/dl) and the patient shows clinical signs of 
severe encephalopathy and/or seizure, with consistent 
EEG findings, treatment with ammonia-​scavenging 
agents (as recommended in Boxes 1 and 2) should be 
initiated. After 2h, signs of seizures and ammonia levels 
should be reassessed; if the patient had an indetermi￾nate response to ammonia-​scavenging treatment dialysis 
should be considered. In patients with serum levels of 
ammonia 301–499 μmol/l (513–850 μg/dl) who show 
clinical signs of moderate to severe encephalopathy or 
seizure, scavenger treatment should be initiated while 
the patient is being prepared for dialysis. However, these 
numerical values should only serve as a general guide 
and should not be applied rigidly. Instead, the evolv￾ing clinical status of the patient should be the primary 
determinant of whether or not to begin KRT.
Institutional preference and local facilities determine 
the choice of dialysis modality. This decision is also influ￾enced by the safety, efficacy and complications of each 
type of dialysis. Intermittent HD and CKRT have proved 
more efficacious than PD15,23. The decision as to whether 
to use HD, CKRT or PD should be made jointly by pae￾diatric, internal medicine, nephrology, metabolism and 
critical care teams, as appropriate. The decision-​making 
process should take into account the availability of dialy￾sis equipment and/or staff, the diagnosis and overall 
condition of the patient, the trend in serum ammonia 
levels, the response to nitrogen-​scavenger therapy and 
the age and body weight of the patient.
Peritoneal dialysis guidelines. PD was the primary 
treatment for hyperammonaemia before the mid￾1990s, when HD and CKRT were considered too risky 
and challenging to perform in neonates and children. 
However, data on the use of PD in this setting show 
that this technique has limited efficacy in the treat￾ment of hyperammonaemia33, and the use of PD in the 
management of hyperammonaemia is now somewhat 
controversial.
A study comparing various modalities of KRT in eight 
patients with hyperammonaemia showed that PD was 
less efficient than intermittent HD or CKRT in reduc￾ing ammonia levels34. Improved outcomes were seen in 
patients with greater ultrafiltration flow rates; that is, 
in those treated with HD and CKRT rather than PD. In 
a 1976 case report of a neonate with argininosuccinic 
aciduria, PD was initiated on day 4 and resulted in an 
improvement in blood ammonia level from 432μmol/l 
(736 μg/dl) to 176 μmol/l (300 μg/dl). However, after 
this initial fall in ammonia concentration, PD failed 
to lower the blood ammonia concentration any fur￾ther35. In a retrospective analysis of data from six Italian

centres describing children and neonates with hyper￾ammonaemia treated with either PD or HD, intermittent 
HD removed ammonia more rapidly than PD, but no 
differences were observed in neurological sequelae or 
survival between patients who received PD and those 
who received HD36. In this study, clinical expertise and 
available resources dictated the ammonia level at which 
dialysis was initiated and what modality was chosen. 
The researchers recommended that PD should be per￾formed in situations where extracorporeal therapies are 
not available or unsafe and that HD should be performed 
in patients who show a rapid rise in blood ammonia 
levels36. A PD protocol is provided in Supplementary 
Information 3. Box 3 lists recommendations from the 
consensus panel for PD.
Some centres, however, might lack the equipment to 
enable the use of other extracorporeal therapies and PD 
might remain the only treatment option. Although PD 
offers a quick alternative for the immediate management 
of hyperammonaemia if HD or CKRT are not available37, 
complications of PD include obstruction and leakage of 
the catheters, which can result in delayed toxin clear￾ance and increased duration of dialysis38. Additionally, 
few devices for PD are suitable for the treatment of 
hyperammonaemia in small children. These devices are 
not always promptly commercially available, and their 
availability mainly depends on the local economic con￾text and established practices. In turn, device availability 
is a factor that contributes to determining the expertise 
of local operators.
CKRT guidelines. The introduction of CKRT (which 
includes CVVH and CVVHDF) led to improvements 
in the outcomes of patients with hyperammonaemia. 
Compared with HD, CKRT results in fewer cardio￾vascular complications, less need for plasma and 
blood transfusions, and a lower risk of rebound hyper￾ammonaemia34,36,39. Owing to its continuous nature, 
CKRT is not associated with major fluid or osmotic 
shifts and therefore has a reduced likelihood of aggra￾vating the raised intracranial pressure associated with 
hyperammonaemia40. The need to obtain vascular access 
is the main limitation to the use of CKRT.
Continuous venovenous HD (CVVHD) is superior to 
conventional HD and PD in infants owing to its ability 
to maintain haemodynamic stability by removing iso￾tonic fluid40. All forms of CKRT are safe and efficacious 
methods for the management of hyperammonaemia; 
however, CVVHD enables a higher ammonia clear￾ance rate than CVVH. A case report described two 
severely symptomatic neonates, aged 5 days and 6 days, 
with blood ammonia levels of 881 μmol/l (1,500 μg/dl) 
Box 2 | Recommendations from the consensus panel for NKRT management

ammonia levels are detected (evidence level 4D)
•	Consensus recommendation 2: discontinue all oral feeds and provide adequate calories (≥100kcal/kg daily) as 
intravenous glucose and lipids (evidence level 4B)

•	Consensus recommendation 4: gradually reintroduce protein (by 0.25g/kg daily, up to 1.5g/kg daily) within 48h 
(evidence level 4C); if stabilization of serum ammonia levels takes longer than 48h and protein is not supplied, protein 
catabolism will drive further ammonia production

(Qb) 30–50ml/min; dialysate flow rate (Qd)/Qb >1.5) 
can be initiated, which enables rapid clearance of ammo￾nia and reduces the need to switch between HD and 
CKRT modalities. Experimental and clinical evidence 
indicates that a Qd >1,000ml/h is required to exploit the 
maximum potential of CKRT in neonates38. Although 
rebound hyperammonaemia has also been reported with 
high-​dose CKRT, this complication occurs to a lesser 
extent than in HD and does not require further KRT 
management. Furthermore, CKRT can be completed 
in a single dialysis run without the need for a change in 
equipment. In two patients with OTC deficiency, rapid 
removal of ammonia was seen after initiation of high￾dose CKRT — Qb 10–20 ml/min in neonates and 
infants or, in older children, the maximum blood flow 
allowed by the catheter. This high-​dose CKRT resulted 
in clearance rates (that is, total replacement and/or 
Qd) of up to 8,000 ml/1.73 m2
/h or more and was safe 
for the patients34. In other studies, Qb 10–20ml/min in 
neonates and infants has achieved clearance rates (total 
replacement and/or Qd) of ≥2,500 ml/1.73 m2
/h41,43. 
However, not all CKRT machines can achieve an opti￾mal Qd value. One CKRT device (Asahi Sigma Plasauto) 
allows a Qd of up to 6 l/h, whereas the Prismaflex and 
Fresenius devices (paediatric circuits) limit Qd to 1l/h. 
Overall, these Qd restrictions limit the efficiency of 
CKRT and create the need for additional HD in patients 
with very high ammonia levels. Additionally, the liter￾ature shows that problems with vascular access, hep￾arinization, electrolyte alterations and clotting of the 
membrane and/or circuit may lead to inadequate CKRT 
(that is, delivered other than as prescribed in the recom￾mendations below). Protocols for CKRT and high-​dose 
CKRT are included in Supplementary Information 3. 
Recommendations from the consensus panel for CKRT 
are presented in Box 4.
Haemodialysis guidelines. Intermittent HD can decrease 
blood ammonia concentrations by 75% within 3–4 h 
(ref.
37). The main limitations of this method in neonates 
are the risk of rebound hyperammonaemia and the 
need to obtain vascular access, although such access has 
been achieved with the use of a peripheral artery and 
umbilical vein44. A 2007 study comparing different 
forms of KRT in eight infants with hyperammonaemia 
found that patients receiving intermittent HD showed a 
50% reduction in ammonia levels after 1–2 h, whereas 
patients treated with CVVHD took 2–14h to show this 
level of reduction34. However, the presence of rebound 
hyperammonaemia often necessitates treatment with 
multiple HD sessions, which can cause hypotension 
and rapid osmotic shifts that further compromise the 
haemodynamic stability of the patient44. The hypoten￾sion associated with the use of intermittent HD can 
also worsen cerebral oedema and increase the chance of 
cerebral herniation in patients with raised intracranial 
pressure45. However, in low-​body-​weight infants, short-​
duration, intermittent HD is a safe and effective way to 
ensure rapid reversal of hyperammonaemia and enable 
the patient to recover between dialysis sessions, which 
prevents HD-​related prolonged hypotension, membrane 
clotting and prolonged heparinization46. The rapid shifts 
and 776 μmol/l (1,322 μg/dl), respectively, who were 
later diagnosed with OTC deficiency41. Both patients 
were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The 
5-​day-​old patient presented with cyanosis and gasp￾ing and was intubated and started on CKRT, given his 
haemodynamic instability. The ammonia level of the 
patient decreased to 367  μmol/l (625 μg/dl) within 2 h 
and he exhibited spontaneous movement and neuro￾logical improvement within 1h of starting CKRT41. The 
6-​day-​old patient presented with poor feeding, vomit￾ing and somnolence, and was treated with high-​dose 
CKRT in view of a pretreatment blood ammonia level of 
1,387μmol/l (2,362μg/dl). The patient’s ammonia levels 
decreased dramatically to 90 μmol/l (153 μg/dl) within 
7 h of treatment, rebounded to 402 μmol/l (685 μg/dl) 
within 10h, but remained <100μmol/l (170μg/dl) over 
the next 24h without further KRT. After 6 months, this 
patient underwent liver transplantation41. These case 
reports show that CVVHD results in greater ammonia 
clearance than CVVH. In neonates undergoing CKRT, 
the use of a warmed dialysate provides added haemo￾dynamic stability42. Although fewer complications are 
associated with CKRT than with other forms of dialysis, 
the pre-​CKRT status of each individual is a major deter￾minant of survival. A retrospective study showed that 
the most important prognostic factor was the duration of 
hyperammonaemic coma prior to the start of dialysis27; 
by contrast, patient outcomes were not influenced by the 
rate of ammonia clearance36.
In patients with blood ammonia levels >1,500μmol/l 
(2,555μg/dl), high-​dose CKRT (maximal blood flow rate

•	Consensus recommendation 10: CKRT should be initiated in a patient with 
hyperammonaemia in the following situations: 
- Rapidly deteriorating neurological status, coma, or cerebral oedema with blood 
ammonia level >150μmol/l (256μg/dl) (evidence level 3B)

in osmolarity associated with HD also increase the risk 
of further elevations in intracranial pressure, especially 
in neonates. Thus, in these patients, osmolarity should 
be monitored regularly during HD, and the dialysate for￾mula should be modified to minimize or avoid any rapid 
shifts in osmolarity47.
In patients with inborn errors of metabolism, high 
HD infusion rates enable the administration of calo￾ries (along with ammonia clearance) to prevent catab￾olism41,48. An HD protocol is listed in Supplementary 
Information 3. Box 5 presents recommendations from 
the consensus panel for HD.
Hybrid therapy guidelines. The use of HD or CKRT 
alone is effective in treating and reducing toxic ammo￾nia levels. However, combinations of HD and CKRT, 
known as hybrid or sequential therapy, can gradually 
reduce ammonia levels while controlling the rebound 
effect. The results of a retrospective study showed that 
HD should be the first-​line KRT modality for rapidly 
reducing ammonia levels, followed by CKRT to pre￾vent any rebound49. Another advantage of CKRT is the 
ability to safely replace electrolytes lost during dialysis, 
which is not possible in intermittent HD. Accordingly, 
hybrid therapy is initiated with HD when ammonia 
levels are >1,500μmol/l (2,555μg/dl), then transitioned 
to CKRT1,41. Step-​down CKRT can follow either HD or 
high-​dose CKRT once ammonia levels are <200μmol/l 
(280μg/dl) on at least two consecutive hourly measure￾ments. Nitrogen-​scavenging agents should be instituted 
once the patient is off HD or high-​dose CKRT to prevent 
rebound.
Another hybrid method of KRT is CKRT with ECMO 
support. In a neonate requiring urgent dialysis, the need 
for a small catheter size and the small volume of the 
dialysate circuit can limit ammonia clearance. ECMO is 
primarily used in patients with cardiorespiratory failure, 
although a few studies have shown the need for ECMO 
in low-​birth-​weight neonates with hyperammonaemia 
and severe hypotension requiring HD50–52. The use of 
CKRT with ECMO can increase the blood volume of the 
patient, enables the use of a larger cannula, avoids haemo￾dynamic instability and leads to the rapid clearance of 
ammonia. ECMO-​assisted CVVHD results in improved 
haemodynamic stability and safer dialysis in neonates, 
but carries an increased risk of causing a substantial cer￾ebrovascular event. This risk is particularly elevated in 
low-​birth-​weight neonates, possibly owing to poor heart 
function, increased cerebral blood flow and increased 
intracranial pressure53,54.
An alternative form of hybrid therapy consists of 
therapeutic hypothermia combined with various KRT 
modalities. This approach is based on the recognition 
that whole-​body therapeutic hypothermia can slow 
down ammonia production by decreasing metabolism 
throughout the body. Each 1 °C decrease in body tem￾perature reduces the basal metabolic rate by 8%54. A pilot 
study testing various approaches to KRT combined 
with therapeutic hypothermia showed a faster decline 
and earlier stabilization of ammonia levels when the 
same KRT modality was compared in therapeutically 
cooled versus normothermic patients55. Further studies 
are required to determine the true effects of therapeutic 
cooling on the reduction of ammonia levels and the 
improvement in neurological outcomes in patients with 
hyperammonaemia. Box 6 presents recommendations 
from the consensus panel for hybrid therapy.
Conclusions
A high index of suspicion for hyperammonaemia is 
mandatory in paediatric patients of any age with sugges￾tive clinical symptoms, given that almost all survivors 
have developmental disabilities that correlate with the 
number, severity and duration of hyperammonaemic 
episodes. Prompt treatment with KRT and/or NKRT, 
the choice of which depends on the ammonia con￾centrations and presenting symptoms of the patient, 
is crucial. The paediatric literature with regard to 
hyperammonaemia requiring KRT is limited. To our 
knowledge, a consensus recommendation including 
a literature review with expert guideline recommen￾dations has not yet been published. More studies are 
needed to strengthen the recommendations presented 
in this article; these recommendations will be followed 
by an audit.

Box 5 | Recommendations from the consensus panel for HD
•	Consensus recommendation 14: intermittent HD is recommended in patients who 
require rapid ammonia clearance (evidence level 3B).
•	Consensus recommendation 15: for hyperammonaemia, initiation of intermittent HD 
is recommended in the following situations:
- Rapidly deteriorating neurological status, coma, or cerebral oedema (evidence 
level 3B)
- HD or high-dose CKRT may be used as initial therapy in patients with blood 
ammonia levels >1,000μmol/l (1,703μg/dl) (evidence level 4D).
CKRT, continuous kidney replacement therapy; HD, haemodialysis.
Box 6 | Recommendations from the consensus panel for hybrid therapy
•	Consensus recommendation 16: HD or CKRT combined with ECMO is recommended 
in neonates, especially those who are haemodynamically unstable. The combination 
of HD or CKRT with ECMO increases the patient’s blood volume, enables the use of 
a larger cannula and facilitates improved haemodynamic control (evidence level 4D).
•	Consensus recommendation 17: HD or CKRT combined with ECMO is suggested for 
the treatment of hyperammonaemia in the following situations: 
- Haemodynamic instability in a small neonate with poor vascular access for standard 
CKRT (evidence level 4D)
- Rapidly deteriorating neurological status, coma, or cerebral oedema (evidence 
level 4D)
- Presence of moderate or severe encephalopathy. Moderate encephalopathy is 
defined as lethargy, distal flexion, decreased activity, complete extension, hypotonia, 
weak suck or incomplete Moro reflex, constricted pupils, or bradycardia69. Severe 
encephalopathy is defined as stupor or coma, no activity, decerebrate posture, 
flaccid tone, absent suck, absent Moro reflex, pupils non-reactive to light, variable 
heart rate or sleep apnoea69 (evidence level 4D).
- Persistently high blood ammonia levels >400μmol/l (681μg/dl) refractory to NKRT
medical measures (evidence level 4D)
- A rapid rise in ammonia levels to >300μmol/l (511μg/dl) within a few hours that 
cannot be controlled via NKRT medical therapies (evidence level 4D)
CKRT, continuous kidney replacement therapy; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; 
HD, haemodialysis; NKRT, non-kidney replacement therapy.
