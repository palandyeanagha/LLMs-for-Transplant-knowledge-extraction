SUMMARY The rate at which the acute phase protein response occurred after both major and minor
surgery was explored. Increases in the plasma concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-i￾acid glycoprotein (a,AG) and fibrinogen were not detected until 6-8 h after the initial incision. The
peak concentration of CRP occurred at 48 h and that of fibrinogen at 96 h; a,AG concentrations
rose rapidly until 48 h followed by little change until about 120 h. Although there was widespread
variation in the concentrations of individual proteins in patients, severity of injury did not seem to
have a significant effect on the time course of the change. Plasma cortisol concentration and the
total white blood cell count (WBC) reached their peaks before the acute phase proteins, cortisol at
6handWBCat 12h.
In recent years there has been considerable interest in
the acute phase protein response to injury and the
mediators involved in its control. 1-3 The stimulus for
the increase in concentration of these proteins in the
blood appears to be non-specific, since the rises have
been observed after many forms of tissue injury or
bacterial infection.4 It has been suggested that
measurement of these proteins, particularly
C-reactive protein (CRP), can be used to confirm the
presence of infection or disease.5 However, the
measurements can be of little value until the temporal
relations between the stimulus and the resulting
changes in the plasma proteins have been defined.
A group of substances, collectively termed
leucocyte endogenous mediator (LEM), synthesised
by activated leucocytes, has been implicated in the
initiation of the acute phase protein response. LEM
stimulates hepatic RNA synthesis within a few hours
in experimental animals6 and causes increased
synthesis of acute phase proteins such as CRP,7
fibrinogen and haptoglobin,8 and caeruloplasmin.9
Corticosteroids have been shown to have a permissive
effect in this process. '0 Kushner and Feldman " have
shown that in rabbits there is a delay between the
occurrence of trauma and hepatic synthesis of CRP as
would be anticipated from the above hypothesis.
We have studied the early time course of the acute

phase protein response in humans. The relatively
minor trauma of a surgical operation such as
herniorrhaphy is a stimulus of suitably short duration.
In addition neither blood nor intravenous fluids
are usually administered during this operation and
the interpretation of changes in plasma protein
concentrations is therefore less complicated. The
response in a small number of other operations was
also studied for comparison.
Material and methods
Patients entering hospital for elective surgery were
studied. There were 13 patients with unilateral
hernias, three patients for cholecystectomy, four for
varicose vein ligation and one case each of lymph￾node biopsy, partial colectomy, total hip replacement
and spinal fusion. No selection of patients was made
within the groups. Samples of venous blood (15 ml)
were taken imnmediately prior to operation (0 time)
and at various times after the initial skin incision.
Samples were assayed for CRP, alpha-i-acid
glycoprotein (a,AG), fibrinogen, cortisol, albumin,
haemoglobin, haematocrit and white blood cell count
(WBC). In all cases protein concentrations were
corrected by normalising the haematocrit to that
before operation; where there is little blood loss
during the operation this provides a method of
correcting for any changes in fluid distribution
between body compartments.

Ho
The calculation used was Pn = Ps x H
Pn = normalised protein concentration.
Ps = sample protein concentration.
Ho = haematocrit at time 0.
Hs = haematocrit of the sample.
Clotted blood was collected for assay of the acute
phase serum proteins and cortisol, and samples with
EDTA as anticoagulant for fibrinogen, WBC and
haematocrit. Serum was stored at 4°C until assayed,
which was generally within seven days, and plasma
was stored at -20°C for up to two weeks, the proteins
having been found to be stable under these
conditions.
Antisera were purchased from Seward Laboratory,
London, for CRP and fibrinogen, and from Dako￾immunoglobulins a/s, Denmark, for a,AG. Standard
human serum and plasma were obtained from
Hoechst UK Ltd.
CRP, a,AG and fibrinogen were assayed by an
end-point immunonephelometric method using a
Hyland Laser Nephelometer PDQ (Travenol
Laboratories, Thetford, Norfolk, UK). Samples and
standards were diluted into antiserum in the presence
of polyethylene glycol, MW 4000, at a concentration
of 40 g/l, using an automatic diluter (Micromedic
Systems, NY). Antiserum concentrations were
chosen such that the highest expected results would
fall well within the antibody excess portion of the
calibration curve. All samples from one patient were
generally assayed within the same batch and the
intrabatch coefficients of variation for all assays were
less than 5%, except for CRP at concentrations below
10 mg/l, where the CV was 11-5%.
Albumin was assayed on a Technicon Auto￾Analyzer using a bromocresol green method based on
the procedure of Doumas et al'2 and using Bovine
Albumin Standard Solution from Miles Laboratories
Ltd (UK) as primary standard.
Plasma cortisol was determined by the fluorimetric
procedure of Spencer-Peet et al. 13 WBC and
haematocrit were measured on a Coulter Counter
Model S.
The "normal" ranges for the acute phase proteins
were:
CRP < 10 mg/l
a,AG 285-1000 mg/l
Fibrinogen 1- 55 0 g/l.
Results
The plasma concentrations of all the acute phase
proteins studied were found to increase after
herniorrhaphy. There was a delay of 6-8 h before
increases in concentrations of any of the proteins
were measurable. Thereafter the most rapid rise was
shown by CRP which, as shown by others,'4 reached a
peak at about 48 h postoperation (Fig. 1). The peak
concentration varied from 38 mg/l to 196 mg/l for
seemingly equivalent hernia operations. There was
no relation between peak concentration and age of
the patient, or with postoperative progress. After the
peak the concentration slowly fell and was still
markedly raised at 144 h. Similar results were
obtained with other operations; cholecystectomy
produced changes of comparable magnitude to her￾niorrhaphy, while Trendelenburg ligation of varicose
veins produced a rise to only 36 mg/l and the con￾centration returned to normal by 144 h (Fig. 1). A
single example of an inguinal lymph node biopsy
produced a rise to 15 mg/l.
After herniorrhaphy the delay mentioned above
was followed by a rapid rise in a,AG concentration.
This reached a plateau at about 48 h and remained
raised until 120 h, after which there was a decrease
(Fig. 2). In the case of fibrinogen the lag period was
again seen. The subsequent rise was much slower,
reaching a peak at 96 h postoperation (Fig. 3). There
was a decrease in fibrinogen and a,AG
concentrations before the rise but this was not
statistically significant.
A number of operations of greater severity than
those described above were also studied including
partial gastrectomy, partial colectomy, hip
arthroplasty and spinal fusion. In many of these there
was appreciable blood loss and transfusion and it is
not possible to correct accurately for fluid volume
changes in the blood. However, essentially the same
pattern of changes in CRP was seen and the

maximum concentrations were no greater than those
obtained after herniorrhaphy (Fig. 4). A similar
pattern was observed even in cases where the
concentrations of the acute phase proteins were
raised prior to operation. For example, in a case of
total hip replacement performed for an infected hip
prosthesis the preoperative CRP concentration was
45 mg/l. There was still a delay before any changes
were seen in the concentrations of CRP, a~AG and
fibrinogen. The peak concentrations were again
observed at similar times and the maximum
concentrations were within the ranges obtained for
herniorrhaphy. The same pattern was observed in a
patient undergoing a partial colectomy for Crohn's
disease where the preoperative CRP was 40 mg/l
(Fig. 4).

acute phase proteins after herniorrhaphy are
summarised in Fig. 5. The first change seen was an
increase in cortisol, reaching a maximum at about
6 h postoperation. This was closely followed by an
increase in the WBC, peaking at about 12 h. No
increases were seen in the concentrations of the acute
phase proteins CRP, a,AG and fibrinogen until 6-
8 h after the beginning of the operation. C-reactive
protein reached its maximum at approximately 48 h
followed by aiAG and fibrinogen. There was no
change in albumin concentration (after correction for
haematocrit) in the herniorrhaphy patients, but there
was a decrease in the cholecystectomy group,
beginning during the operation and maximal at about

Discussion
An acute phase protein is a plasma protein the
concentration of which increases in response to tissue
damage.5 Previous studies of such changes have
concentrated mainly on the effects after at least 24 h,
with little regard to the early period.4 Our studies
show that there is a definite lag period between onset
of trauma and the start of the increase in the
concentrations of the acute phase proteins after
surgery in man. In most cases it was not possible to
exclude small changes in CRP concentration during
the first 6-8 h postoperation since the measured
values were at the lower limit of detection of our tech￾nique. However no changes were seen during this
period in the three patients studied in whom the con￾centrations were raised prior to surgery. The sensi￾tivities of the methods used for fibrinogen and a,AG
were, however, adequate to detect small deviations
from the basal concentrations and neither of these
proteins showed any increase from preoperative con￾centrations until 6-8 h after the initial skin incision.
The increases in the concentrations of the proteins
are unlikely to be due to fluid shifts. There was little
blood loss during herniorrhaphy (less than 50 ml) and
any loss should lead to a fall in plasma protein
concentration.'8 Changes due to posture can be
eliminated because patients were lying in bed for
several hours both before and after operation. The
effects of early mobilisation can also be ruled out
because moderate exercise increases plasma protein
concentration by not more than 15% and the
concentration returns to the previous value after 25
minutes of rest.'9
The magnitude of the response appeared to be
proportional to the degree of trauma only for small
injuries such as node biopsy and varicose vein ligation
(Fig. 2). A maximal response was obtained with
herniorrhaphy, which we had originally assumed
would represent minimal trauma; the concentrations
reached with partial gastrectomy, orthopaedic
operations or cholecystectomy were of the same
order as those seen after herniorrhaphy (Fig. 5). Even
where the CRP concentration was raised before
operation there was no additional increase in
magnitude of response; in fact the increase was
considerably less than in those patients with low
initial concentrations. It is tempting to suggest that
after surgery there is a maximal capacity for
production of the acute phase proteins, and that this
capacity is reached with only a limited degree of
trauma. Our conclusions in this study vary from those
of Dominioni et al who suggested that there was a
close correlation between increases in CRP
concentration and the magnitude of operation.20
Since the acute phase proteins in this study are
synthesised in the liver it is necessary to postulate
a mechanism for transmitting a signal from the site
of injury. The temporal relation of peak values
of cortisol, WBC and acute phase proteins demon￾strated here are consistent with the current concept
that infection and, we suggest, trauma, lead to the
release of substances from damaged cells which
stimulate leucocytes to produce a series of poly￾peptides including leucocyte endogenous mediator
(LEM) and endogenous pyrogen (EP), which in turn
have a variety of effects on different tissues and
organs. An important effect on the liver is to promote
increased synthesis of the acute phase proteins.6
Changes seen in the concentration of these proteins
must be assessed in the light of the length of time since
the injury. Because of the lag period the acute phase
proteins are not good indicators of the current state of
the patient; they could not be used to assess hour to
hour progress of inflammation or infection because
increases in the concentration of acute phase proteins
in plasma relate to an event of at least 6-8 h
previously.
Using a radioimmunoassay method for CRP,
which is of greater sensitivity than the nephelometric
method, we have confirmed the existence of a lag￾phase before increase in serum CRP concentration
after operation.
We should like to thank the Department of
Haematology, Charing Cross Hospital for the WBC
and haematocrit results.
