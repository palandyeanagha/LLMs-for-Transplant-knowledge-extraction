Abstract
Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) can evolve quickly and clinical measures of function often fail to detect AKI
at a time when interventions are likely to provide benefit. Identifying early markers of kidney damage has been
difficult due to the complex nature of human AKI, in which multiple etiologies exist. The objective of this study
was to identify and validate novel biomarkers of AKI.
Methods: We performed two multicenter observational studies in critically ill patients at risk for AKI - discovery and
validation. The top two markers from discovery were validated in a second study (Sapphire) and compared to a
number of previously described biomarkers. In the discovery phase, we enrolled 522 adults in three distinct cohorts
including patients with sepsis, shock, major surgery, and trauma and examined over 300 markers. In the Sapphire
validation study, we enrolled 744 adult subjects with critical illness and without evidence of AKI at enrollment; the
final analysis cohort was a heterogeneous sample of 728 critically ill patients. The primary endpoint was moderate
to severe AKI (KDIGO stage 2 to 3) within 12 hours of sample collection.
Results: Moderate to severe AKI occurred in 14% of Sapphire subjects. The two top biomarkers from discovery
were validated. Urine insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), both inducers of G1 cell cycle arrest, a key mechanism implicated in AKI, together
demonstrated an AUC of 0.80 (0.76 and 0.79 alone). Urine [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] was significantly superior to all
previously described markers of AKI (P <0.002), none of which achieved an AUC >0.72. Furthermore, [TIMP￾2]·[IGFBP7] significantly improved risk stratification when added to a nine-variable clinical model when analyzed
using Cox proportional hazards model, generalized estimating equation, integrated discrimination improvement or
net reclassification improvement. Finally, in sensitivity analyses [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] remained significant and superior
to all other markers regardless of changes in reference creatinine method.
Conclusions: Two novel markers for AKI have been identified and validated in independent multicenter cohorts.
Both markers are superior to existing markers, provide additional information over clinical variables and add
mechanistic insight into AKI.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a vexing clinical problem, in
part, because it is difficult to identify before there is loss
of organ function, which may then become irreversible
[1]. Patients developing AKI have a markedly increased
risk of death prior to hospital discharge [2,3] and survi￾vors also appear to be at significant short- and long-term
risk for complications [4,5]. Available therapies are
mainly predicated on supportive measures and the
removal of nephrotoxic agents [6]. Thus, risk assessment
for AKI is recommended by clinical practice guidelines
[6]. However, risk stratification remains very difficult,
mainly due to limited sensitivity and specificity of the
available diagnostic tests for AKI [7]. Prior efforts at
identifying biomarkers for AKI have been hampered by
the heterogeneous nature of the condition. Many differ￾ent etiologies for AKI have been reported (for example
sepsis, nephrotoxins, ischemia), and in any given patient
the cause is typically thought to be multifactorial [8].
Here we report the results of a prospective, multicenter
investigation in which two novel biomarkers for AKI
were identified in a discovery cohort of critically ill adult
patients and subsequently validated using a clinical assay
and compared to existing markers of AKI in an indepen￾dent validation cohort of heterogeneous critically ill
patients.
Materials and methods
Subjects
We conducted a two-stage program in which we first col￾lected blood and urine samples from three distinct cohorts
(Discovery study) to identify novel protein biomarkers for
AKI. These single-center studies were used to identify the
best biomarkers among 340 proteins, including novel
candidates and previously described biomarkers such as
kidney injury marker-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase￾associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin-C, interleukin-18 (IL￾18), pi-glutathione S-transferase (pi-GST), and liver fatty
acid-binding protein (L-FABP). Data from all three cohorts
were pooled for analysis. A fourth cohort (Sapphire study)
was assembled from 35 clinical sites in North America and
Europe and used to validate the performance of the best
biomarkers (urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2
(TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7
(IGFBP7)) from the Discovery study (Figure 1). The Sap￾phire study was approved by the Western Institutional
Review Board (Olympia, Washington, USA). In addition,
the study protocols were approved by investigational
review boards/ethics committees as required, by each parti￾cipating institution. All subjects (or authorized representa￾tives) provided written informed consent.
The Sapphire study was designed and reported
according to the STROBE guidelines [9]. As shown in
Figure 1, the Discovery study enrolled patients who
were admitted to an intensive care unit (any type), were
at least 18 years of age and typically had at least one
recognized risk factor for AKI. The Sapphire (validation)
study enrolled critically ill patients who were at least 21
years of age, admitted to the intensive care unit within
24 hours of enrollment, expected to remain in the ICU
with a urinary catheter for at least 48 hours and were
critically ill (respiratory or cardiovascular dysfunction).
Patients with known existing moderate or severe AKI
(KDIGO [6] stage 2 or 3) were excluded. Sample size
for the Sapphire study was based on the results of the
Discovery study and is explained in detail in Additional
file 1.
Sample and data collection
Paired urine and blood samples were collected at enroll￾ment and up to 18 hours later by standard methods and
centrifuged. Plasma (EDTA), serum and urine superna￾tants were frozen, shipped on dry ice, stored at ≤-70°C
and thawed immediately prior to analysis. Clinical data
including patient demographics, prior health history,
serum creatinine, and hourly urine output as available in
the hospital record were collected. Samples were analyzed
at Astute Medical by technicians blinded to clinical data.
Password-protected, anonymized clinical data collected
with electronic case-report forms resided on servers
at independent sites (Acumen Healthcare Solutions,
Plymouth, MN, USA and Medidata Solutions, New York,
NY, USA for Discovery and Sapphire studies, respectively).
Clinical endpoints
AKI status was classified using the RIFLE [10] or AKIN
criteria [11] together as described in the recent KDIGO
international guideline [6] based on the serum creatinine
(sCR) and urine output (UO) available in the hospital
record. The primary endpoint for the Sapphire study was
the development of moderate or severe AKI (KDIGO stage
2 or 3) within 12 hours of sample collection. The reference
values for serum creatinine were obtained as follows: if at
least five values were available the median of all values
available from six months to six days prior to enrollment
was used. Otherwise, the lowest value in the five days prior
to enrollment was used. If no pre-enrollment creatinine
was available, the creatinine value at the time of enroll￾ment was used (see Additional file 1 for full details). We
performed sensitivity analyses by repeating the primary
analysis using several different methods of reference creati￾nine assignment. Details including the sensitivity analyses
are given in Additional file 1. Secondary endpoints for the
purpose of characterizing the patient population included
renal replacement therapy at any time during hospitaliza￾tion, survival and major adverse kidney events. We defined
major adverse kidney events (MAKE30) as the composite
of death, use of renal replacement therapy, or persistence

of renal dysfunction (defined by serum creatinine ≥200% of
reference) at hospital discharge truncated at 30 days [12].
Biomarker selection
Candidate biomarkers were identified through hypotheses
based on AKI pathophysiology. Medline was searched
from March 1995 to January 2011 for full reports of origi￾nal research and review articles with the terms ‘Acute kid￾ney injury’ OR ‘Acute renal failure’ AND/OR including
one or more of the following terms: inflammation, apopto￾sis, necrosis, endothelial injury, cell-cell and cell-matrix
adhesion, cytoprotection, oxidative processes and cell
cycle. Abstracts were downloaded for all titles of potential
relevance. Full papers were downloaded when the abstract
was deemed relevant. A total of 340 candidate biomarkers
were identified for analysis in the Discovery study. Proteins
expressed in the kidney and peripherally (for example, in
leukocytes) were included in the analyses. Biomarkers
were ranked by ability to predict development of AKI
RIFLE I or F within 12 to 36 hours. All possible combina￾tions of two to four biomarkers (novel or previously
described) were ranked to ensure that any biomarker that
might contribute in top-performing combinations of bio￾markers was retained.
Laboratory methods
Biomarkers were measured with single or multiplexed
immunoassays using standard ELISA, Luminex 200
(Luminex, Austin, TX, USA), MSD SECTOR Imager
6000 (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), or
Astute140™ Meter (Astute Medical, San Diego, CA,
USA) platforms. Immunoassays were either developed by
Astute Medical or obtained from vendors and used as
recommended by the vendor or modified to optimize
performance. Novel biomarkers were measured with
research assays (TIMP-2: R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA; IGFBP7: Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in the
Discovery study and with the NephroCheck™ Test
(Astute Medical, San Diego, CA, USA) in the Sapphire
study. The NephroCheck Test was developed to simulta￾neously measure the two top-performing biomarkers
(urine [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]) from the Discovery study

using a platform that can be used clinically. Previously
described biomarkers of AKI (including urine KIM-1,
urine and plasma NGAL, plasma cystatin-C, urine IL-18,
urine pi-GST, and urine L-FABP) were measured with
commercially available assays (see Additional file 1).
Statistical analysis
The primary analysis was based on area under the recei￾ver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) comparing
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] to previously described biomarkers for
the development of the primary endpoint (KDIGO stage 2
to 3 within 12 hours of sample collection, for samples col￾lected within 18 hours of enrollment). We also character￾ized the distributions of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] values and
several existing marker levels for AKI by severity and for
various non-AKI conditions. We characterized risk for
KDIGO stage 2 to 3 within 12 hours of sample collection
and for MAKE30 by [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]. We calculated
relative risk for KDIGO stage 2 to 3 by tertile. We com￾puted the AUCs for novel and existing biomarkers in sev￾eral subgroups of patients (see Additional file 1). We
constructed a model based on the clinical variables found
to be associated with the primary endpoint (P <0.1) and
examined whether the addition of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]
improved risk prediction using time to event, integrated
discrimination improvement (IDI), category-free net
reclassification improvement (cfNRI) and risk assessment
plot analyses (see Additional file 1). Statistical analyses and
biomarker selection in the Discovery study were per￾formed by Astute Medical. The primary statistical analyses
for the Sapphire study were performed by a team of inde￾pendent statisticians (MW, JS, and JH). Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA) and R 2.12 [13]. For all analyses, two-sided P values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Categorical variables were analyzed using the Fisher exact
test or logistic regression. AUC was calculated as empirical
AUC with bootstrap confidence intervals to handle sub￾jects with more than one sample collected within 18 hours
of enrollment. Differences between AUCs were tested
using bootstrap sampling. Time to event analyses used
Cox proportional hazards regression with the log trans￾form of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] because the distribution was
right-skewed. Tests of trend in relative risk across tertiles
used the Jonckheere-Terpstra test [14].
Results
Subject characteristics and event rates
We enrolled 744 subjects in the validation cohort, 460
(62%) from North American sites and 284 (38%) from
Europe (Figure 1). Sixteen patients (2%) were excluded
from the analysis cohort because of withdrawal of consent,
loss to follow-up, or invalid or missing test results leaving
728 subjects for the analysis. Demographic information for
the analysis cohort is depicted in Table 1. Overall, 101
subjects (14%) in the analysis cohort met the primary end￾point of moderate or severe AKI (11% stage 2, 2.5% stage
3) within 12 hours. In addition, 218 (30%) developed AKI
within seven days (22% stage 2, 8% stage 3) and 49 (6.7%)
underwent renal replacement therapy during the hospital
stay truncated at 30 days. A total of 121 (17%) died prior
to hospital discharge truncated at 30 days. Finally, 161
subjects (22%) met the MAKE30 endpoint.
Novel biomarker performance
Urinary insulin-like growth factor binding protein
(IGFBP) 7 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
(TIMP)-2 were the best-performing markers in the dis￾covery study (AUC = 0.77 and 0.75, respectively, for
RIFLE-I/F within 12 to 36 hours; Table S8 in Additional
file 1), and were therefore the markers we sought to
validate in the Sapphire study. Because these markers
appeared to have additive predictive value when used
together in the discovery cohort, we made the decision
to use the combination (a simple two-marker panel) as
the primary readout for the validation. In order to
ensure that this readout could be interpreted using a
commercial assay platform, we used the NephroCheck
Test for the Sapphire study. The test result is a simple
multiplication of the two markers ([TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7])
(see Additional file 1). In the Sapphire study, [TIMP￾2]·[IGFBP7] exhibited an AUC of 0.80 for development
of AKI (stage 2 or 3) within 12 hours and alone IGFBP7
and TIMP-2 each exhibited an AUC of 0.76 and 0.79
respectively (Figure 2 and Table S1 in Additional file 1).
Comparison of biomarker performance to previously
described AKI biomarkers
Figure 2 also shows the AUCs for several previously
described AKI biomarkers (urine and plasma NGAL,
plasma cystatin-C, and KIM-1, IL-18, pi-GST, and L-FABP
in the urine). The AUC for urine [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] was
significantly greater (P <0.002) than any of these existing
biomarkers. We also examined the performance of urine
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] compared to various other markers
including urine KIM-1 and urine NGAL in terms of discri￾mination between AKI of different severities and various
non-AKI conditions including chronic kidney disease
(Figure 3). Unlike existing markers, [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]
showed clear separation between AKI and non-AKI
conditions.
Risk of AKI and MAKE30 by [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] result
Risk of AKI (KDIGO stage 2 to 3 within 12 hours) and
MAKE30 elevated sharply for [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] above
0.3 and almost quintupled and doubled, respectively, for
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] above 2.0 (Figure 4). Relative risk for
AKI (KDIGO 2 to 3 within 12 hours) was also examined

by tertile (data not shown). Compared to the lowest tertile,
subjects with a result in the middle tertile had a 3-fold
relative risk (P <0.001) and those in the highest tertile had
a nearly 10-fold relative risk (P <0.001).
Additional information from biomarkers over clinical
variables
We also examined whether [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] enhances
predictive ability over clinical variables. [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]
significantly improved risk prediction when added to a
nine-parameter clinical model (including serum creatinine
at matched time points with biomarkers) for the primary
endpoint, using time to event, IDI, cfNRI and risk assess￾ment plot analyses (Tables S4-S6 in Additional file 1 and
Figure S3 in Additional file 1). All analyses showed signifi￾cant enhancement by the addition of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]
with [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] remaining strongly associated
with AKI in all models.
Sensitivity analyses
Finally, we performed a variety of sensitivity analyses
(Table S7 in Additional file 1). We examined several meth￾ods of assigning the serum creatinine reference value. We
also examined the effect of including or excluding patients

who had (unbeknownst to the investigators at the time)
reached the endpoint prior to sample collection and
including only the enrollment sample (see Additional file
1). For all sensitivity analyses, our conclusions were
unchanged and the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] AUC was not dif￾ferent from the primary analysis (point estimate for AUC
within the 95% confidence interval) and was higher than
the AUC of all previously described biomarkers tested.
Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first report of an AKI bio￾marker study that used a development-validation approach
with separate patient cohorts in the context of a large pro￾spective multicenter trial framework. Our results are strik￾ing not only in terms of identifying new robust markers
that have improved performance characteristics when
directly compared with existing methods for detecting risk
for AKI, but also provide significant additional information
over clinical data as evidenced by IDI, cfNRI and Cox
models. Furthermore, these molecules are known to be
associated with mechanisms recently implicated in the
pathogenesis of AKI [15-17]. Thus, our results are impor￾tant on two levels, development of new diagnostics and
bolstering understanding of the mechanism of disease.
AKI poses both unique opportunities and challenges for
development of biomarkers to aid in risk assessment. The
ability to sample fluid ‘proximal’ to the site of injury, (that
is urine), is an important advantage. However, AKI is also
challenging because traditional methods of biomarker dis￾covery often rely on model systems where pathogenesis is
well understood or on tissues taken from patients with dis￾ease [18] and, since biopsies are rarely obtained from

patients with AKI, these tissues are not easy to obtain.
Further challenges exist because AKI is not a single disease
but a complex syndrome with multiple underlying etiolo￾gies [6,19]. Animal models are usually the source of tissue
for many biomarker discovery programs, but these rarely,
if ever, exemplify the full complexity of human AKI [20].
For these reasons, we chose to discover potential biomar￾kers in critically ill humans with and without AKI as
opposed to relying on animal models. This approach has
the distinct advantage of being immediately relevant
because the discovered biomarkers are active within the
same context of disease encountered in clinical practice.
Rather than force our current understanding of the disease
mechanisms on the discovery process, we required candi￾date markers to discriminate risk class (that is, high or low
risk of moderate to severe AKI in 12 to 36 hours). Once
the best-performing markers had been identified, we
tested their performance in a second group of adult critical
care patients, thus requiring them to show robust utility
across multiple institutions and patient subtypes. Finally,
we subjected the new markers to analyses that tested their
ability to enhance discrimination over robust clinical
models. For these reasons we believe that these markers
are the most promising early markers of AKI reported to
date.
We chose to assess risk of moderate to severe AKI
rather than all AKI because this severity (corresponding
to KDIGO stage 2 and 3) has been shown to be asso￾ciated with a significantly increased incidence of clini￾cally important outcomes such as need for renal
replacement therapy, in hospital death, and persistent
renal dysfunction [2,3].
Our results also help shed additional light on the patho￾genesis of AKI. Our analysis included more than 300
molecules representing multiple biologic pathways
believed to be important in the pathogenesis of AKI. It is
notable therefore that IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 are both
involved with the phenomenon of G1 cell cycle arrest dur￾ing the very early phases of cell injury (Figure 5) [21-24].
AKI engages a series of extremely complex cellular and
molecular pathways involving endothelial, epithelial,
inflammatory, and interstitial cells. These mechanisms
include cell cycle, immunity, inflammation, and apoptosis
pathways. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to
other epithelia, renal tubular cells enter a short period of
G1 cell-cycle arrest following injury from experimental
sepsis [25] or ischemia [26]. It is believed that this prevents
cells from dividing when the DNA may be damaged and
arrests the process of cell division until the damage can be
repaired lest resulting in the cell’s demise or senescence
[22]. Interestingly, these markers perform very well in
patients with sepsis (AUC 0.82) and post-surgery (AUC
0.85) (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). Also of interest is

that IGFBP7 is superior to TIMP-2 in surgical patients
while TIMP-2 is best in sepsis-induced AKI (Figure S2 in
Additional file 1). These differences may underlie subtle
but important mechanistic differences between various
etiologies of AKI, and the two biomarkers are involved in
slightly different, pathways (Figure 5). These results also
support the use of the two biomarkers, which together
provide the most consistent result across cohorts.
Markers of cell-cycle arrest such as TIMP-2 and
IGFBP7 may signal that the renal epithelium has been
stressed and has shut down function but may still be able
to recover without permanent injury to the organ.

Figure 4 Risk for KDIGO stage 2 to 3 AKI (A) and MAKE30 (B) as a function of urine [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]. Risk at each [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] value along
the abscissa was calculated as follows: the number of samples positive for the endpoint that had [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] above the abscissa value divided by
the total number of samples that had [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] above the abscissa value. Slightly more than 50% of the samples had a [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] value
above 0.3 where risk began to elevate sharply and about 10% of the samples had a [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] value above 2.0 where risk almost doubled and
quintupled for MAKE30 and AKI, respectively. AKI, acute kidney injury; IGFBP7, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7; TIMP-2, tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinases-2.

Importantly, both TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 appear to be able
to signal in autocrine and paracrine fashions [24,27-30]
thus spreading the ‘alarm’ from the site of injury. In
terms of timing, this signal could be ideal as it may be
early enough that treatment can still alter the outcome -
further study will be required to test this hypothesis.
Finally, TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 are known to be involved in
the response to a wide variety of insults (inflammation,
oxidative stress, ultraviolet radiation, drugs, and toxins)
[16,23,24]. This may help explain why they correspond to
risk for AKI, a syndrome known for its multiple etiologies
even in the same patient.
Our study has important limitations. Although we mea￾sured more than 300 candidates in our discovery study,
many taken from unbiased ‘omics’ approaches, our list is
by no means exhaustive. Furthermore, because we felt that
the most important unanswered question was early risk
stratification, we chose to study patients without evidence
of AKI and sought to predict its clinical manifestation
over the next 12 hours. Thus, we emphasized molecules
with a rapid response to injury. We recognize that pro￾gression of disease and recovery are also important clinical
questions and our results do not directly address these
areas.
Figure 5 Proposed mechanistic involvement of the novel biomarkers in AKI: initial tubular cells sustain injury by various insults. In
response to DNA and possibly other forms of damage, IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 are expressed in the tubular cells. IGFBP7 directly increases the
expression of p53 and p21 and TIMP-2 stimulates p27 expression. These effects are conducted in an autocrine and paracrine manner via IGFBP7
and TIMP-2 receptors. The p proteins in turn, block the effect of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase complexes (CyclD-CDK4 and CyclE-CDK2)
on the cell cycle promotion, thereby resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest for short periods of time presumably to avoid cells with possible damage
from dividing. AKI, acute kidney injury; IGFBP7, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7; TIMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2.

Conclusions
Urine TIMP-2, and IGFBP7, two novel biomarkers for risk
stratification of AKI, were discovered and validated in
more than 1,000 critically ill patients. These markers per￾formed better than any other biomarker reported to date,
showed significant enhancement over clinical variables,
are mechanistically relevant, and can be easily measured
with existing technology. Indeed, we chose to validate the
two-marker panel ([TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]) using a clinical
rather than a research assay so as to facilitate rapid trans￾lation into clinical practice. The introduction of this new
test should significantly improve the ability of physicians
caring for critically ill patients to identify risk of impending
AKI; and also facilitate future AKI research by permitting
more accurate identification of high-risk patients for
enrollment into intervention trials.
Key messages
• Urine insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7
(IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2
(TIMP-2) are new biomarkers for AKI and perform better
than existing markers for predicting the development of
moderate or severe AKI (KDIGO stage 2 or 3) within 12
hours of sample collection.
• [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] significantly improved risk stratifi￾cation when added to a nine-variable clinical model when
analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model, general￾ized estimating equation, integrated discrimination
improvement or net reclassification improvement.
• Risk for major adverse kidney events (death, dialysis
or persistent renal dysfunction) within 30 days (MAKE30)
elevated sharply for [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] above 0.3 and
doubled when values were >2.0.
• Both IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 are inducers of G1 cell-cycle
arrest, a key mechanism implicated in AKI.
