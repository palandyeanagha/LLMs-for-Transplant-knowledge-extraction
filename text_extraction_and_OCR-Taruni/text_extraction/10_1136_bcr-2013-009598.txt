Summary
A 47-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
diagnosed at age of 35years was admitted for dyspnoea, substernal
chest pain, dry mucosas and difficulty in swallowing. Physical
examination revealed vesicular breath sounds bilaterally.
Laboratory work showed antinuclear antibody (ANA) (speckled
pattern, 1:40), positive anti-Sjogren’s syndrome antigen (SSA) and
antisingle side band (SSB) and negative double-strand DNA


(dsDNA), with normal C3,C4,C50. A high-resolution chest CT scan
demonstrated multiple bronchial cysts and diffuse interstitial
infiltrates. Surgical lung biopsy revealed emphysematous changes
and mild lymphocytic infiltrate around the bronchioles compatible
with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia diagnosis. This case
illustrates a patient with primary SLE overlapped by initial
manifestations of secondary Sjogren’s syndrome (SS) presenting
with associated autoimmune interstitial lung disease. Antibody
markers, high-resolution chest CT scan and surgical lung biopsy
were essential in evaluating this patient, confirming the interstitial
lymphocytic infiltration of the lung. Primary SS (pSS) is the most
commonly associated disease to lung interstitial pneumonia (LIP)
(25%). High-resolution chest CT scan demonstrates areas of ground-
glass attenuation, suggestive of interstitial disease. Surgical lung
biopsy shows pathologic increase of mature lymphocyte cells and
histiocytes. Most of the cases have a benign presentation and
shortly relapse. Superimposed infection, pulmonary fibrosis and
lymphoma develop in less than 20% of cases. Corticosteroids are
the primary therapy. While pSS is commonly associated with
interstitial lung involvement, secondary Sjogren's syndrome (sSS) is
only rare. It has been described the initial sSS presentation by Sica
symptoms development only, and our case is the first report of LIP
presentation as initial manifestation of sSS. Our patient remained
stable after corticosteroids and hydoxychloroquine therapy and no
progression of disease after 6 months follow-up.
