Batches of the world’s first vaccine against 
the hepatitis E virus began rolling out of 
a Chinese factory last week, promising 
to stem a disease that every year infects about 
20 million people and claims 70,000 lives. 
The vaccine is being hailed as a victory for 
an unusual public–private partnership that 
could set a precedent in China’s burgeoning 
biotechnology sector, and help to deliver other 
vaccines for diseases overlooked in the West. 
The waterborne hepatitis E virus mostly 
occurs in developing countries that have poor 
sanitation, and it is particularly prevalent in 
east and south Asia. Although most cases cause 
only mild illness, it can lead to acute liver fail￾ure — the mortality rate reaches 4% in some 
regions and soars to 20% in women who are in 
the later stages of pregnancy. A severe outbreak 
of hepatitis E in the Xinjiang Uygur Autono￾mous Region in northwest China1
, for exam￾ple, caused almost 120,000 infections and more 
than 700 deaths between 1986 and 1988 (see 
‘Hidden epidemics’). There is no treatment, 
and improved sanitation has so far been the 
most effective way to stem the disease.
The new vaccine, which was approved by 
China’s State Food and Drug Administration 
(SFDA) in December 2011, could transform 
that picture. More than a decade ago, research￾ers at Xiamen University in Fujian province 
genetically modified a strain of the bacterium 
Escherichia coli to produce a protein that, when 
injected into humans, stimulates the body’s 
immune system against hepatitis E. But pre￾clinical and clinical development began in 
earnest only in 2000, when the Yangsheng￾tang Group, a company with interests in food 
and health care, invested 15 million renminbi 
(US$1.8 million in 2000) to set up a joint 
biotech laboratory in partnership with the 
university. The lab was given national status 
in 2006 by the Chinese Ministry of Science and 
Technology and relaunched as the National 
Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Develop￾ment in Infectious Diseases (NIDVD).
The institute aims to unite academia and 
industry in commercializing new vaccines, 
particularly for emerging infectious diseases. 
Yangshengtang set up a subsidiary company 
called Innovax to take potential vaccines 
through clinical trials to manufacturing. The 
hepatitis E vaccine, Hecolin, is the company’s 
first product to reach the market, but it also has 
a vaccine against human papilloma virus that 
is currently in preclinical research. Approval 
for Hecolin came after a phase III clinical trial 
published in 2010 showed that it was highly 
effective in preventing infection among almost 
100,000 healthy participants2
. 
Hecolin cost about 500 million renminbi 
(US$80 million) to develop, much of which 
came from the Chinese government through 
the university. The vaccine will be sold to dis￾tributors in China at a cost of 110 renminbi 
per dose, and the company expects it to reach 
sales of 62 million renminbi in 2013. That is 
hardly a blockbuster income, but, according 
to Jun Zhang, deputy director of the NIDVD, 
the public–private development model helps to 
ensure that vital vaccines are developed regard￾less of whether they prove to be profitable for 
manufacturers. 
Zhang hopes that the success of Hecolin will 
attract further investment in such schemes, 
and says that the Chinese government has 
been encouraging. “Many people — including 
representatives of multinational pharmaceu￾tical companies, venture capitalists, Chinese 
local government officials and Chinese entre￾preneurs — think this is a worthy example of 
biotechnology investment,” he says.

The rich, roasted aroma of coffee or the 
golden-brown colour of crispy French 
fries are enough to set most mouths 
watering. But the high-temperature cooking 
that gives these foods their alluring taste, scent 
and texture also adds a sting: acrylamide, a 
probable human carcinogen.
Swedish scientists discovered in 2002 that a 
wide range of baked and fried goods contain 
worryingly high levels of acrylamide1
 — a 
simple organic molecule that is a neurotoxin 
and carcinogen in rats. The finding sparked an 
international effort to reduce concentrations 
of the chemical by changing ingredients and 
cooking methods. 
Ten years on, a report2
 from the European 
Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in Parma, 
Italy, suggests that this effort has stalled, amid 
patchy monitoring, uncertainty about acryla￾mide’s true health effects and the challenge of 
weeding out a molecule present in hundreds 
of products.
Soon after the Swedish discovery, two teams 
— one led by chemist Donald Mottram at the 
University of Reading, UK, the other by Rich￾ard Stadler at Nestlé in Lausanne, Switzer￾land — unpicked the chemistry behind the 
problem3,4. They found that sugars and amino 
acids such as asparagine found in potatoes and 
cereals were making acrylamide (C3H5NO) 
as a by-product of the Maillard reaction, the 
very process that generates the heady blend of 
colour, flavour and taste in cooked foods. 
Subsequent epidemiological studies involv￾ing tens of thousands of people have looked for 
links between acrylamide and various forms of 
cancer in humans, including breast5
 and colo￾rectal cancer6
. For the most part, the results 
have been negative. In 2007, however, a Dutch 
study7
 of almost 2,600 women found that, 
among those who had never smoked, women 
consuming about 40 micrograms of acryla￾mide per day doubled their risk of develop￾ing cancers of the womb or ovaries, compared 
with those taking in roughly 10μg per day. And 
last month, a study8
 showed that women who 
ate acrylamide-rich food during pregnancy 
tended to give birth to smaller babies. 
Despite the uncertainties over the dangers 
of acrylamide, Europe’s legislators and food 
producers vowed to take action. Since 2005, 
the industry group FoodDrinkEurope has 
maintained a ‘toolbox’ of tactics to help reduce 
acrylamide levels, such as changing potato vari￾eties or storage conditions, and reducing cook￾ing temperatures. According to Beate Kettlitz, 
the group’s director of food policy, 90% of large 
and medium-sized companies in Europe now 
select potato varieties with low levels of the sug￾ars that can form acrylamide, and all control 
French-fry cooking times to limit browning. 
In 2007, the European Commission 
instructed the EFSA to collate yearly data on 
acrylamide levels. Last week, the authority 
released the most recent figures2
 showing that 
acrylamide levels in finished food products 
hardly changed between 2007 and 2010. There 
have been isolated successes: in soft bread, for 
example, mean acrylamide levels dropped from 
75 to 30μg per kilogram. But for crispbreads,

Bid to curb fried-food 
chemical goes cold
Acrylamide levels still too high in Europe’s food, says report.
GlaxoSmithKline had already developed a 
separate hepatitis E vaccine in collaboration 
with the US Army, which showed promise in 
phase II trials3
. But with hepatitis E mostly 
occurring in developing countries, there was 
little commercial potential for the vaccine. 
“This is true not just of hepatitis E, but also 
many other plagues in the world,” says Zhang.
Medical products for conditions such as 
hepatitis E that predominantly affect the 
developing world “are not seen as big money 
opportunities”, agrees Jeremy Farrar, director 
of the Oxford University Clinical Research 
Unit in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. “New 
companies operating with different funding 
models offer a great opportunity, and one 
which could have a profound impact.” 
Hecolin may have arrived just in time to 
tackle a rise in hepatitis E in Africa, where a 2007 
outbreak4
 in Uganda infected more than 10,000 
people and killed 160. By the end of Septem￾ber this year, more than 200 cases of jaundice 
caused by hepatitis E had been reported in 
refugee camps in Kenya since August, and 
three refugee camps in South Sudan have seen 
16 deaths and 400 cases of hepatitis E infec￾tion since July. “Cases are rising day by day, 
thus placing immense pressure on the available 
health services and resources. This is of grave 
humanitarian concern,” said South Sudan’s 
health ministry in a statement in September.
Xiamen University and Innovax are in talks 
with the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
register Hecolin with the organization’s Prequal￾ification Programme, which makes medicines 
available to agencies such as the United Nations 
Children’s Fund and the Joint UN Programme 
on HIV/AIDS. “We have to be sure that these 
vaccines can be used anywhere,” says Farrar. “It 
would be a great shame if these products were 
not available outside China.”
“We have to accept that companies such as 
this one in China are going to be very impor￾tant in the future,” he adds. “The rest of us have 
to catch up. We need to find a way, through the 
WHO, of ensuring the absolute transparency, 
safety and effectiveness of their vaccines.” ■
