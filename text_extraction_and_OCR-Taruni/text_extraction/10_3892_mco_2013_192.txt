Abstract. Eosinophilia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been associated with the 
development of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease 
(cGVHD). However, a limited number of studies have investi￾gated the course of eosinophil counts in relation to the onset of 
cGVHD. In this study, the course of relative eosinophil counts 
(RECs) was retrospectively analyzed in 64 patients who devel￾oped cGVHD following allogeneic HSCT in relation to overall 
survival (OS), relapse rate and clinical course of cGVHD. At 
onset of cGVHD, eosinophilia was observed in 45% of the 
patients and developed one week prior to cGVHD diagnosis. 
Furthermore, a trend towards improved OS in patients with 
eosinophilia was observed. Beneficial effects were most evident 
in patients who exhibited decreasing eosinophil counts one week 
after diagnosis of cGVHD. By contrast, an increase in or stable 
eosinophil counts one week after diagnosis were associated with 
significantly impaired OS and a significantly higher rate of later 
aggravation of cGVHD. Findings of this study suggested that 
the course of eosinophil counts may provide a useful parameter 
in the assessment of cGVHD development and activity allowing 
the potential identification of patient subpopulations with a good 
outcome and reduced cGVHD‑related mortality.
Introduction
Although eosinophils constitute only 1-4% of the periph￾eral blood leukocytes, they may be important in various
inflammatory infectious and allergic diseases (1). Chronic 
graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a serious complica￾tion of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(allo‑HSCT). cGVHD can occur in almost every organ and 
clinical diagnosis and staging are challenging (reviewed
in NIH cGVHD consensus conference guidelines) (2,3). 
Although the pathophysiology of cGVHD remains ambiguous, 
previous data have shown the involvement of a T helper (Th) 2 
cell‑mediated process with overexpression of Th2 cytokines, 
such as IL-4 and IL-5 (4-6), and the correlation of eosino￾philia with the development of acute and cGVHD (7-17). 
Th2-mediated immune responses linked to eosinophilia 
are regularly identified in allograft rejection following solid 
organ transplantation (18,19). Investigations of the course of 
eosinophilia suggest a role of eosinophil counts as a predictive 
marker for graft rejection in these patients (19).
The majority of studies investigating the role of eosinophils 
in allo‑HSCT have focused on the incidence of eosinophilia in 
relation to overall survival (OS) and relapse‑related mortality 
in patients developing acute GVHD (8,10,11,14,15,17). A 
limited number of studies are available regarding the devel￾opment of chronic GHVD, and their focus is on eosinophilia 
as a risk factor rather than on the course of peripheral blood 
eosinophils in the context of time of diagnosis and initial treat￾ment of cGVHD (9,12-14,16).
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of eosino￾phil counts in cGVHD. Our findings suggest that eosinophil 
count changes constitute a possible indicator for overall 
cGVHD activity, severity and treatment response, aiding 
clinicians in the diagnosis and management of cGVHD 
patients.
Patients and methods
Patients. The clinical records of 64 patients developing 
cGVHD after allo‑HSCT at the University of Regensburg 
Medical Center (Regensburg, Germany) between June, 1998 
and December, 2003 were included in this study and 
retrospectively analyzed. The retrospective analysis for 
this study was approved by the ethics committee of the 
Regression of eosinophil counts after diagnosis of chronic 
graft-versus-host disease as a potential marker for 
improved clinical outcome

University of Regensburg (Germany). Regular follow‑up 
was performed at least two years after allo‑HSCT (median,
66.7 months).
The patients received standard infectious prophylaxis 
with aciclovir, fluconazole, co-trimoxazole and ciprofloxacin 
alone or in combination with metronidazole. Intravenous 
immunoglobulins were administered in case of severe 
hypogammaglobulinemia (<4 g/l). Patient characteristics are 
provided in Table I.
Acute GVHD was treated with prednisolone and other 
immunosuppressive agents as needed. Cyclosporin A (CSA) 
was usually discontinued 6 months after HSCT if there was 
no evidence of GVHD. Acute and cGVHD were initially 
diagnosed and retrospectively reassessed according to the 
respective official diagnosis criteria (3,16). Among the 
64 patients developing cGVHD, localized mucosal/skin 
involvement or hepatic dysfunction due to cGVHD was classi￾fied as limited cGVHD in 16 patients (25%) and as extensive 
cGVHD in 48 patients (75%). Initial first‑line therapy for 
cGVHD was prednisolone (1-2 mg/kg body weight) or 
topic steroids. Fifty patients (78%) additionally received 
systemic/topic CSA or CSA dose escalation at diagnosis of 
cGVHD. Twenty‑one patients (33%) exhibited later clinical 
cGVHD aggravation during follow‑up defined by further 
intensification of steroid treatment.
Methods. Eosinophil counts were retrospectively evaluated on 
days -14, -7, 0 and +7 in relation to the first day of cGVHD 
diagnosis with an allowed deviation of 2 days to the date of the 
blood samples on days -14 and -7. Eosinophilia was defined as 
a peripheral relative eosinophil count (REC) of >4% according 
to the value used in recent publications and the internal 
reference standards of our Institution (2,8,19). In addition, 
clinically relevant changes in eosinophil counts were assumed 
in an increase/decrease of at least 1%. For further analysis, 
patients were stratified into three groups based on the course 
of eosinophil counts 7 days after cGVHD diagnosis compared 
to eosinophil counts at cGVHD diagnosis. The first group 
(decreasing eosinophils, n=25) showed decreasing eosinophil 
counts after cGVHD diagnosis of ≥1%. The second group 
(intermediate eosinophils, n=30) comprised patients with
intermediate eosinophil counts, which were not increasing 
and not decreasing >1% at day +7. Compared to group 1, the 
patients of the third group (increasing eosinophils, n=9) exhib￾ited increasing RECs of ≥1% 7 days after cGVHD diagnosis.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using 
SPSS version 17. Univariate analysis was performed using
the χ2
 test, Fisher's exact test and paired Student's t-test as 
indicated. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox's 
proportional hazard analysis. For OS, actuarial curves were 
obtained using the Kaplan‑Meier method and were statistically 
compared using the log-rank test. In all analyses, a two-sided 
significance level of P=0.05 was considered to indicate a 
statistically significant difference.
Results
OS, RR and cGVHD aggravation. Previous studies 
suggested eosinophilia as an indicative parameter for clinical 
outcome (8,11,14). Therefore, we analyzed the OS, relapse rate 
(RR) and cGVHD aggravation of the patients included in this 
study. A trend towards improved OS was observed in patients
with eosinophilia compared to those without eosinophilia 
(P=0.11, Fig. 1). No difference was observed between the 
two patient groups with regard to relapse rate (P=0.29), limited 
cGVHD (P=0.10) and later cGVHD aggravation (P=0.60).
Course of peripheral blood eosinophils in cGVHD patients. 
Since RECs potentially reflect the activity of cGVHD, we
investigated patients based on the development of the eosino￾phil course one week after cGVHD diagnosis. The analysis 
of the course of RECs demonstrated that patients with a 
decrease of >1% the week after diagnosis, exhibited a signifi￾cant increase of RECs the week prior to cGVHD diagnosis
(Fig. 2A). In patients with an additional increase of eosinophil 
counts the week following cGVHD diagnosis, a significant 
increase of eosinophils to the same levels as in the decreasing 
course of RECs group was observed (Fig. 2B). Notably, the 
analysis of patients without a significant change of RECs after 
diagnosis did not demonstrate any significant changes before 
and after cGVHD diagnosis (Fig. 2C). In agreement with these 
findings, significantly more patients with eosinophilia were 
observed in the decreasing (88%, P≤0.001) and increasing 
(66%, P≤0.001) groups compared to the intermediate course 
of RECs group (7%).
Changes of eosinophil counts after cGVHD diagnosis in the 
three groups. OS was then analyzed in relation to the eosino￾phil course after diagnosis. The analysis of the Kaplan‑Meier 
survival curve demonstrated a significantly improved OS
(P=0.04) in the decreasing compared to the increasing course 
of RECs group (Fig. 3). The survival curve of patients without 
significant changes of RECs also showed a significantly
impaired OS compared to patients with increasing (P=0.52) 
and decreasing eosinophil groups (P=0.03). Focusing on 
potential factors in explaining the different OS rates, no
significant correlation was observed between organ manifes￾tation of cGVHD and eosinophil counts in the three groups 
(P>0.05). Regarding the rates of limited cGVHD disease and 
the overlap of acute and cGVHD, no significant differences 
were observed among the three groups (P>0.05, Table I). 
Proceeding acute GVHD was found to occur more frequently 
in the increasing (100%, P=0.04) and intermediate groups
(93%, P=0.007) compared to the decreasing course of RECs 
group (58%). Notably, the analysis of relapse rate did not differ 
among the three groups (P>0.05), while cGVHD aggrava￾tion after diagnosis occurred significantly less frequently in 
patients with decreasing (12%) compared to patients with an 
increasing course of RECs (66%, P=0.004). A strong tendency 
towards a higher incidence of later cGVHD aggravation was 
observed in patients with decreasing compared to patients with 
no significant changes in the course of RECs (37%, P=0.06).
Steroid treatment. The role of steroid treatment in the 
three groups was also analyzed, possibly affecting
the eosinophil course after cGVHD diagnosis. The 
percentage of patients administered steroid dose escalation 
(1-2 mg/kg body weight) did not differ between patients 
with decreasing (60%) and increasing RECs (44%, P=0.46).

Patients without significant changes in the course of RECs 
exhibited a significantly lower frequency of steroid escala￾tion (23%) compared to the decreasing (P=0.01) group, while 
this was not the case compared to the increasing course of 
RECs group (P=0.24).
Results of multivariate analysis. A multivariate analysis was 
performed with parameters including age, relapse, previous 
history of acute GVHD, limited or extended cGVHD and 
eosinophil behaviour. Age (P=0.01) and relapse (P=0.001) 
were identified as independent factors for OS, in contrast to
eosinophil counts (P=0.45), previous history of acute GVHD 
(P=0.89) and limited or extended cGVHD (P=0.49).
Discussion
cGVHD significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality 
after allo‑HSCT. Therefore, the identification of risk factors 
and clinical markers predicting cGVHD and its clinical course 
are important to enable possible pre‑emptive therapy and 
treatment changes (16).
The role of eosinophilia in cGVHD patients remains 
ambiguous. Two previous studies have shown a correlation 
of eosinophilia with improved OS and reduced non‑relapse 
mortality, and have demonstrated no difference in the rate of 
relapse (8,14). In agreement with findings of those studies, the 
present study has shown that cGVHD patients with eosinophilia 
demonstrated a tendency towards an improved outcome in OS, 
while no difference was identified for the relapse rate or limited 
cGVHD as reported elsewhere (8,14). By contrast, a previous
study by Ahmad et al (7) did not show improved OS in patients 
with cGVHD and eosinophilia in patients administered only 
reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with peripheral blood 
stem cell transplant as stem cell source for allogeneic recipi￾ents, of which the vast majority had myeloma or non‑Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) as the underlying disease. Similarly, a direct 
comparison between the results of Ahmad et al (7), the results 
of the present study and other studies (8,14) is difficult due to 
the heterogeneity of the patients and transplant characteristics, 
such as conditioning intensity, stem cell source and underlying 
disease.
Conflicting results have not only been reported for 
eosinophilia and the overall outcome after allo‑HSCT, but 
also for the correlation of eosinophilia with the development 
of cGVHD. A number of studies have shown no correla￾tion of eosinophilia to cGVHD, whereas according to other 
studies eosinophilia precedes or parallels the development 
of cGVHD (9,12‑14,16,17). Kim et al (14) reported a biphasic 
pattern in the course of eosinophilia following allo‑HSCT 
with two peaks, one prior to day +100 and one ~200 days after 
HSCT, possibly explaining the conflicting results concerning 
eosinophilia and GVHD in previous studies.
As a result, the exact time course of eosinophil counts 
in cGVHD patients before and after diagnosis, taking into 
consideration steroid treatment, was investigated in this study. 
Two different patterns of the relative eosinophil course were 
identified. Patients exhibiting later increasing or decreasing 
RECs following diagnosis showed relatively stable counts from 
day -14 to day -7, but showed a similar increase at the day of 
diagnosis. The other pattern was observed in patients without 
significant RECs changes. Eosinophil counts remained stable 
over time and did not show any increase at the day of the 
diagnosis most likely due to the higher administered steroid 
dose observed in this group. Previous studies in solid organ

transplantation have demonstrated that eosinophilia frequently 
occurs 2-4 days prior to the onset of graft rejection (19,20). 
In agreement with the patient groups in the present study, 
Ahmad et al (7) reported an increase of the eosinophilia 
counts 4.5 days prior to diagnosis and a prompt decrease of 
the eosinophil counts after the initiation of cGVHD treatment.
However, not all patients with cGVHD developed eosino￾philia with RECs >4% or relevant changes of the eosinophil 
counts, explaining the potentially insufficient value of eosino￾philia as a sensitive predictive marker for cGVHD diagnosis 
due to low sensitivity. However, a high specificity of eosino￾philia for acute rejection in solid organ transplantation has 
been reported (19,20).
Focusing on eosinophil counts as a marker for cGVHD 
activity including changes of subclinical RECs not being clas￾sified as eosinophilia, we investigated patients depending on 
the course of the eosinophil counts the week after diagnosis. 
A significant survival advantage of patients with decreasing 
RECs compared to patients with additional increasing RECs 
the week after diagnosis was identified. The two groups did 
not differ in terms of relapse rate and limited cGVHD, while
patients with further increasing RECs exhibited a significantly
increased rate of later cGVHD aggravation, possibly contri￾buting to the impaired OS. In agreement with this observation, 
patients without significant RECs changes also exhibited a 
strong tendency to later cGVHD aggravation. Concerning 
additional factors affecting OS (16), the role of significant 
higher percentage of previous history of acute GVHD in the 
group with increasing RECs compared to other groups remains 
ambiguous since none of the patients exhibited cGVHD 
overlapping from acute GVHD. In addition, the multivariate 
analysis suggested only age and relapse as independent factors 
for survival.
Notably, during the analysis of steroid treatment as a 
possible bias on eosinophil counts, the percentage of patients 
administered steroid dosage escalation as part of the cGVHD 
therapy did not differ in the decreasing and increasing course 
of RECs groups. However, higher steroid doses already applied 
prior to cGVHD diagnosis could cover changes of eosinophil 
counts as observed in patients without significant RECs

changes. In addition, the possibility that other factors apart 
from the supposed Th2 cytokine pattern inducing eosinophilia 
may contribute to cGVHD pathophysiology could not be 
excluded (4,5).
In conclusion, the results of this study support the role of 
eosinophil counts changes as a marker for cGVHD activity 
and future severity. A further increase of RECs the week after 
cGVHD diagnosis indicates uncontrolled disease activity as 
observed in a higher percentage of later cGVHD aggravation 
and this may contribute to impaired OS. By contrast, spon￾taneous or possibly steroid‑induced decreasing eosinophil 
counts account for better control of cGVHD disease activity,
indicated by a reduced frequency of later cGVHD aggrava￾tion and, consequently, an improved OS. Due to the need for 
further improvement of therapy and treatment decision making 
in cGVHD patients, eosinophil decrease the week following 
diagnosis may help identify those patients that may benefit
from graft versus leukemia effects in the presence of control￾lable cGVHD. For more detailed investigation, prospective 
clinical trials on larger patient cohorts with well‑defined 
testing interventions directed to the pathophysiology of the 
disease, may help to identify additional groups of patients that 
could benefit from cGVHD and gain a better understanding of 
the correlation between eosinophils, Th2 cytokines, cGVHD 
and its treatment.
