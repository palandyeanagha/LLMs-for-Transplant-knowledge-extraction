© 2013 The Japan Society of Histochemistry and The dynamics of the renal lymphatic circulation in diabetic nephropathy is not fully elucidated.
The present study evaluated the effect of diabetic nephropathy on the renal lymphatic
circulation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice (ICR-STZ) and in type 2
diabetic KK/Ta mice which were fed a high fat diet (KK/Ta-HF). The diabetic mouse kidneys
developed edema because of the nephropathy. In control mice renal lymphatic vessels
distributed in the cortex but rarely in the medulla while in ICR-STZ and KK/Ta-HF mice,
there were many lymphatic vessels with small lumen in both cortex and medulla. Total
numbers and areas of renal blood vessels in the diabetic mice were similar to those in the
controls while the total numbers and areas of renal lymphatic vessels were larger in diabetic
mice than in the controls. There were statistically significant differences in the numbers of
lymphatic vessels with diameters of 50–100 μm between the ICR-STZ and the control ICR
mice, and in the numbers of lymphatic capillaries with diameters smaller than 50 μm between
the KK/Ta-HF and the control KK/Ta mice. The diabetic nephropathy may induce the
lymphangiogenesis or result in at least the renal lymphatic vessel expansion.

I. Introduction
Diabetes mellitus is a common disease in Japan
affecting approximately 2.7 million people. The 95% of
diabetes mellitus is type 2 diabetes associated with
metabolic disorders while type 1 diabetes is a failure of
glucose metabolism based on insulin deficiencies arising
from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting β
cells. Elevated glucose levels lead cardiovascular systems
to induce both proinflammatory cytokine production and
oxidative stress, therefore, diabetes mellitus results in
microvascular complications to peripheral arteries [2, 19,
23]. Approximately 20–30% of patients with diabetic
nephropathy develop renal insufficiency. Type 1 diabetic
patients often have enlarged kidneys with an elevation in
the glomerular filtration rate. Without specific treatment,
80% of type 1 diabetic patients with persistent micro￾albuminuria progress to overt nephropathy within 15 years
and more than 75% of overt nephropathy sufferers shift to
end-stage renal disease within 20 years. Type 2 diabetic
patients often have microalbuminuria at the time of the first
diabetic diagnosis and 20% of type 2 diabetes patients with
overt nephropathy will progress to end-stage renal disease
within 20 years based on the high mortality rate of cardio￾vascular disease prior to progression to end-stage renal
disease. It is known that a family history of end-stage renal
disease and hypertension, and defects in the angiotensin￾converting enzyme and the sodium proton pump are signif￾icant risk factors for the renal failure development [2, 19,
23].
Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive glomerulo￾sclerosis caused by excess accumulation of extracellular
matrix overproduced by mesangial cells with increased
formation of advanced glycation end products like Nε￾carboxymethyl lysine, and with secretion of various cyto-

98 Uchiyama et al.
kines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) from
podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells,
and leukocytes in the glomeruli. Characteristics of diabetic
nephropathy include mesangial expansion, loss of podo￾cytes, glomerular hyperplasia, thickening of the glomerular
basement membrane, and tubular epithelial cell dysfunction.
The mesangium finally causes the occlusion of the glomer￾ular capillaries under a diabetic milieu [6, 16, 17, 22].
There are many reports of the biology of diabetic nephrop￾athy, but little is known about the dynamics of the renal
lymphatic circulation in diabetic nephropathy. Renal lym￾phangiogenesis occurs in chronic interstitial nephritis and
kidney transplants [14]. Therefore, it is thought that
nephropathy is a cause of the renal circulation developing
to the pro-lymphangiogenic state as a compensatory
response to renal edema and hypertension. This study aimed
to investigate the effect of the diabetic nephropathy on the
renal lymphatic circulation in type 1 and type 2 diabetic
model mice.
II. Materials and Methods
Experimental animals
This study used KK/TaJcl (KK/Ta) mice as a mouse
model with type 2 diabetes and the streptozotocin (STZ)-
induced diabetic mice (ICR-STZ) as a mouse model with
type 1 diabetes [15, 21]. The protocol for the animal use
was reviewed and approved by the animal experiment
committee of Fukuoka Dental College in accordance with
the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Five-week-old
male ICR mice (n=5) (Japan Clea Inc., Osaka, Japan) were
given a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (200 mg/kg
body weight) (Sigma, St. Louis) in a 0.05 M citric acid
buffer at pH 4.5 (20 mg/ml). One week after the STZ
injection, diabetes was confirmed by measurement of the
blood glucose using a Glutest Sensor (Sanwa Kagaku
Kenkyusyo CO., LTD., Nagoya, Japan), and we designated
ICR-STZ mice with blood glucose above 600 mg/dl for
four months as insulin-dependent type 1 diabetic mice.
Nine-week-old male KK/Ta mice (n=5) (Japan Clea
Inc., Osaka, Japan) with a genetic background of insulin￾independent diabetes were fed a high fat diet feed for
diabetes mellitus studies (HFD32, Japan Clea) for five
months, and we designated KK/Ta mice with blood glucose
above 600 mg/dl as type 2 diabetic mice (KK/Ta-HF). The
controls were ICR mice given a 0.05 M citric acid buffer
and nine-week-old male KK/Ta mice before feeding with
HFD32.
Immunohistochemistry
The collection of the mouse tissue was conducted
after euthanasia by induction anesthesia of the mice with
2% Isoflurane (1 l/min) and intraperitoneal injections
with sodium pentobarbital (10 ml/kg, Nembutal, Abbott
Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Frozen 10 μm sections
cut in a cryostat and placed on slide glasses were fixed in
100% methanol for 5 min at –20°C. The sections were
treated with 0.1% goat serum for 30 min at 20°C and then
the sections were treated with PBS containing 0.1% goat
serum and primary antibodies (1 μg/ml): hamster mono￾clonal anti-mouse podoplanin (AngioBio Co., Del Mar,
CA) as a marker of podocyte and lymphatic endothelium,
and rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse platelet endothelial cell
adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, Abcam) as a marker
for blood endothelium for 8 hr at 4°C. After the treatment
with the primary antibodies the sections were washed three
times in PBS for 10 min and immunostained for 0.5 hr at
20°C with 0.1 μg/ml of second antibodies: Alexa Fluor
(AF) 488 or 568-conjugated goat anti-hamster or anti-rabbit
IgGs (Probes Invitrogen Com., Eugene, OR). The immuno￾stained sections were mounted in 50% polyvinylpyrrolidone
solution.
Measurement of the number of vasculature
The immunostained mouse kidney sections were
examined by fluorescence microscopy (BZ-8100, Keyence
Corp., Osaka, Japan). The numbers of PECAM-1-stained
blood vessels and podoplanin-stained lymphatic vessels
were counted at five different areas (0.9 mm×0.7 mm).
All experiments were carried out five times, repeatedly,
and data are expressed as means±standard deviations
(SD). Statistically significant differences (p<0.01) were
determined by the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test with
STATVIEW 4.51 software (Abacus concepts, Calabasas,
CA).
Measurements of the areas of vasculature
The area of PECAM-1-stained blood vessels and
podoplanin-stained lymphatic vessels were measured at
ten different spots (0.36 mm×0.36 mm) in the renal sec￾tion images at 100× magnification using ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All experiments were
carried out five times, repeatedly, and data are expressed as
means±SD. Statistically significant differences (p<0.01)
were determined by the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test
with STATVIEW 4.51 software (Abacus).
III. Results
Immunohistochemical examination of lymphatic vessels in 
the diabetic mouse kidneys
The ICR-STZ mouse kidneys were light gray and
statistically significantly larger than the ICR control mice
(ICR-STZ vs ICR=length 14.55±1.34 mm vs 11.75±0.27
mm; width 8.53±0.41 mm vs 7.27±0.65 mm) (Fig. 1). In
the immunostaining for podoplanin and PECAM-1 in the
mouse heart sections, narrow lymphatic vessels were
immunostained by anti-podoplanin and blood vessels with
opened lumen were immunostained by anti-PECAM-1 but
not by anti-podoplanin (Fig. 1B). None of the negative
controls had no cross reactions with primary and secondary
antibodies, and there were no differences in the fluores￾cence intensity of the target protein of the simple immuno￾staining with anti-PECAM-1 or anti-podoplanin and the

ICR-STZ mouse kidneys with diabetic nephropathy show light gray. The size of the kidneys is significantly larger in the ICR-STZ mice than
in the ICR mice. (B) Immunostaining for podoplanin and PECAM-1 in the mouse tongue sections. Narrow lymphatic vessels (arrowheads)

with narrow lumens (asterisks), but not to blood vessels with rounded lumens (arrows). Anti-PECAM-1 reacted to blood vessels and weakly to
glomerular capillaries. Bar=100 µm.

double immunostaining. In the ICR, ICR-STZ, KK/Ta, and
KK/Ta-HF mouse kidney cortex, anti-podoplanin reacted
with glomeruli and lymphatic vessels, while anti-PECAM￾1 reacted with blood vessels (Fig. 2). In the low power
fields of the ICR control mouse sections, podoplanin￾stained glomeruli were present in the cortex near the renal
surface and podoplanin-stained lymphatic vessels were
present in the cortex near the cortico-medullary border,
but absent in the renal medulla (Fig. 3). In the ICR-STZ
mice, there were many anti-podoplanin-stained lymphatic
vessels in the cortex and medulla at the peritubular space
(Fig. 3). There was no hyperplasia or denaturation with
cloudy swelling in the tubular epithelial cells, however, it
was observed that renal tubules and the peritubular space
was expanded in the renal medulla in the ICR-STZ mice.
In the low power fields of the KK/Ta control mouse
sections, podoplanin-stained glomeruli were present in
the cortex near the renal surface and podoplanin-stained
lymphatic vessels were present in the cortex near the
cortico-medullary border, but absent in the medulla as well
as it was absent in the ICR mice (Fig. 4). In the KK/Ta-HF
mice, there were many anti-podoplanin-stained lymphatic
vessels in the cortex and medulla at the peritubular space
and this was also observed in the ICR-STZ mice (Fig. 4).
It was further observed that renal tubules and the peritubular
space expanded in the renal medulla in KK/Ta-HF mice.
Quantitative analysis for the number of lymphatic vessels in 
the diabetic mouse kidneys
There were no statistically significant differences in
the total numbers of renal blood vessels of the ICR-STZ
and ICR control mice, or between the KK/Ta-HF and KK/
Ta control mice (Fig. 5). For the number of lymphatic
vessels in the kidney tissue, the total numbers and the
number of vessels with diameters of 50–100 μm were
statistically significant larger in the ICR-STZ mice than in
the ICR control mice. There were no statistically significant
differences in the numbers of renal lymphatic vessels with
diameters below 50 μm or over 100 μm between the ICR￾STZ and ICR control mice. The total numbers of lymphatic
vessels and the number of vessels with diameters below 50
μm in the kidney tissue were statistically significant larger
in the KK/Ta-HF mice than in the KK/Ta control mice.
There were no statistically significant differences in the

The HE staining shows that the kidney tissue is collapsed by edema (asterisks): renal tubules and the peritubular space expanded in the renal
medulla (RM) in the ICR-STZ mice compared with the ICR control mice. In the ICR control mice, podoplanin-stained glomeruli (arrows) are
present in the renal cortex (RC) near the renal surface and podoplanin-stained lymphatic vessels (arrowheads) are present in the cortex near the
cortico-medullary border (CM), but absent in the renal medulla (RM). In the ICR-STZ mice, many podoplanin-stained lymphatic vessels
(arrowheads) are present in the cortex and medulla at the expanded peritubular space (asterisks). Bar=100 µm.

100 μm or over 100 μm between KK/Ta-HF and KK/Ta
control mice.
Quantitative analysis for the area of lymphatic vessels in the 
diabetic mouse kidneys
There were no significant differences in the anti￾PECAM-1-stained renal blood vessel areas of the ICR and
ICR-STZ, and between the KK/Ta and KK/Ta-HF mice
(Fig. 6). The anti-podoplanin-stained renal lymphatic vessel
areas were statistically significant larger in the ICR-STZ
than in the ICR, and larger in the KK/Ta-HF than in the
KK/Ta mice.
IV. Discussion
The diabetic mouse kidneys showed macroscopic
findings of swelling and pale discoloration, and showed
histological findings where renal tubules and the peritubular
space expanded in the renal medulla of the ICR-STZ mice
although there were no hyperplasia and denaturation with
cloudy swelling in the tubular epithelial cells. These results
suggest that the renal tissue suffered from nephropathy
with edema (Fig. 1). The PECAM-1 is commonly expressed
on vascular endothelial cells and podoplanin is the marker
of lymphatic endothelial cells and podocytes [11, 20].
Further, the expression of podoplanin has been reported on
tooth germ epithelial cells and salivary gland myoepithelial
cells in somatic tissue [1, 7, 10]. In the mouse heart and
kidney tissue, it was confirmed that anti-PECAM-1 reacted
with blood vessels, and anti-podoplanin with lymphatic
vessels and podocytes (Figs. 1, 2). These results suggest
that the immunostaining with the antibodies took place
successfully. In both the ICR and KK/Ta control mice, the
distribution of lymphatic vessels was observed in the cortex
near the cortico-medullary border but not in the cortex
near the renal surface, or in the renal medulla (Figs. 3, 4).
In both the ICR-STZ and KK/Ta-HF mice, there were many
lymphatic vessels with small lumens both in the cortex
near the cortico-medullary border and in the medulla at
the expanded peritubular space (Figs. 3, 4). It has been
established that renal lymphatic vessels are present around
large- and middle-sized arteries in the cortex but rarely
at the peritubular space in non-diabetic medullas [5, 13,
Fig. 4. Distribution of lymphatic vessels in the KKTa and KK/Ta-HF mouse kidneys. The immunostained sections were re-stained by HE
staining. The HE staining shows that the kidney tissue is collapsed by edema (asterisks): renal tubules and the peritubular space expanded in
the renal medulla (RM) in the KK/Ta-HF mice when compared with the KKTa control mice. In the KKTa control mice, podoplanin-stained
glomeruli (arrow) are present in the renal cortex (RC) near the renal surface and podoplanin-stained lymphatic vessels (arrowheads) are present
in the cortex near the cortico-medullary border, but absent in the renal medulla (RM). In the KK/Ta-HF mice, many podoplanin-stained
lymphatic vessels (arrowheads) are present in the cortex and medulla at the expanded peritubular space (asterisks). Bar=100 µm.

Renal Lymphatic Circulation of Diabetic Mice 103
18]. Therefore, the results here would suggest that the
renal lymphatic circulation increases in diabetic mice with
nephropathy.
The total numbers and areas of blood vessels in the
renal tissue of the ICR-STZ or KK/Ta-HF mice were
similar to those in the ICR or KK/Ta control mice (Figs. 5,
6). Although a progressive glomerulosclerosis finally
causes the occlusion of the glomerular capillaries in a
diabetic milieu, there may be no significant alteration in
the renal microcirculation outside the glomeruli with
diabetic nephropathy. Here it is noteworthy that the total
numbers and areas of the lymphatic vessels in the renal
tissue were statistically significant larger in the ICR-STZ
and KK/Ta-HF mice than in the ICR and KK/Ta control
mice (Figs. 5, 6). There were also statistically significant
differences in the numbers of small lymphatic vessels
with diameters of 50–100 μm between the ICR-STZ and
the control ICR mice, and in the numbers of lymphatic
capillaries with diameters below 50 μm between the KK/
Ta-HF and the control KK/Ta mice. Since there were no
statistically significant differences in the numbers of renal
lymphatic vessels with diameters above 100 μm between
the ICR-STZ or KK/Ta-HF diabetic mice and the controls,
it is thought that renal lymphangiectasia or the development
of initial lymphatics had occurred in the diabetic mouse
kidneys with edema. It has been reported that high glucose
levels increase the production of TGF-β in proximal tubular
cells, glomerular epithelial cells, and mesangial cells, and
high glucose and TGF-β coordinately augment the pro￾duction of excess amounts of vascular endothelial growth
factors in renal cells with diabetic conditions [3, 4, 9, 12].
Further, it has been reported that lymphangiogenesis
occursin chronic interstitial nephritis, IgA nephropathy, and
myelomatic kidneys [8, 14]. The condition of diabetic
nephropathy may allow renal cells to trigger the cytokine
network to induce lymphangiogenesis or result in at least
the renal lymphatic vessel expansion. Further studies for the
cytokine production are required for the renal tissue with
diabetic nephropathy.
