Abstract
FIZZ (found in inflammatory zone) 1, a member of a cysteine-rich secreted protein family, is highly induced in lung allergic
inflammation and bleomycin induced lung fibrosis, and primarily expressed by airway and type II alveolar epithelial cells.
This novel mediator is known to stimulate a-smooth muscle actin and collagen expression in lung fibroblasts. The objective
of this study was to investigate the in vivo effects of FIZZ1 on the development of lung fibrosis by evaluating bleomycin￾induced pulmonary fibrosis in FIZZ1 deficient mice. FIZZ1 knockout mice exhibited no detectable abnormality. When these
mice were treated with bleomycin they exhibited significantly impaired pulmonary fibrosis relative to wild type mice, along
with impaired proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression. Deficient lung fibroblast activation was also noted in the
FIZZ1 knockout mice. Moreover, recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to injured lung was deficient in FIZZ1 knockout
mice. Interestingly in vitro FIZZ1 was shown to have chemoattractant activity for bone marrow cells, including bone
marrow-derived dendritic cells. Finally, overexpression of FIZZ1 exacerbated fibrosis. These findings suggested that FIZZ1
exhibited profibrogenic properties essential for bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis, as reflected by its ability to induce
myofibroblast differentiation and recruit bone marrow-derived cells.

Introduction
Found in inflammatory zone (FIZZ1), initially identified in lung
allergic inflammation, belongs to a class of cysteine-rich secreted
proteins known as the FIZZ/RELM (resistin-like molecules) family
[1,2,3]. The FIZZ/RELM family consists four known members,
FIZZ1/RELMa, FIZZ2/RELMb, FIZZ3/resistin, and RELMc,
characterized by their conserved 10-cysteine residue motif, with 2
members, FIZZ2/RELMb and FIZZ3/resistin, having an addi￾tional cysteine residue in the highly variable N-terminus [1,2,3,4].
This family has a unique tissue expression pattern. FIZZ1 is
prominently expressed in white adipose tissue with low levels of
expression noted in lung, heart and mammary glands. FIZZ1 is
first reported to inhibit the nerve growth factor-mediated gene
expression in dorsal root ganglion neurons [1]. It has an inhibitory
effect on 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes, but
does not affect cell proliferation [5]. Together with Ym1, FIZZ1 is
specifically produced by macrophages in response to IL-4 both
in vivo and in vitro [6,7], and have been used as indicators of
alternative activation. Recently, more evidence showed that
FIZZ1 is involved in various lung diseases. FIZZ1 is highly
induced in a mouse chronic hypoxia model of pulmonary
hypertension, where it is referred to as hypoxia-induced mitogenic
factor (HIMF) [8]. FIZZ1 has multiple functions including
mitogenic, angiogenic and vascular remodeling roles [8,9,10].
FIZZ1 is highly induced in bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis
[11,12]. In the lung it is primarily expressed by airway and
alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), which is upregulated by the Th2
cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 via STAT6 dependent mechanisms. In
vitro FIZZ1 stimulates type I collagen and a-smooth muscle actin
(a-SMA) expression in lung fibroblasts indicative of myofibroblast
differentiation, a key feature in lung fibrosis. Similar effects are
noted during airway remodeling in a model of allergic airway
disease [13]. Additionally FIZZ1 has an anti-apoptotic effect on
lung fibroblasts in vitro [11,12,14,15]. Induction of FIZZ1 has also
been noted in a murine model of colitis, where it is found to recruit
inaflammatory cells and is chemotactic for eosinophils [16],
consistent with its ability to recruit bone marrow derived cells to
the lung [17,18]. In the gut it is reported to also activate IL-17
pathogenic responses and inflammation [19].
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating condition
that leads to progressive lung destruction and scarring. It is
currently believed that IPF is an epithelial-fibroblastic disease, in
which unknown factors disrupt the homeostasis of alveolar
epithelial cells, resulting in diffuse epithelial cell injury with
aberrant epithelial repair and activation [20]. Profibrotic media￾tors, such as TGF-b1, produced by these injured AEC can then
recruit and activate adjacent mesenchymal cells to constitute
fibrotic foci composed of fibroblast-like cells, including differen￾tiated myofibroblasts [20,21,22], which are the key effector cells in
fibrogenesis [23,24]. Given that FIZZ1 is primarily induced in
AECs and functions as an inducer of myofibroblast differentiation
it is likely to play a significant role in mediating such cross-talk
between epithelial cells and fibroblastic cells.
The objective of this study was to investigate the in vivo role of
FIZZ1 in pathogenesis of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

should contribute to understanding of key processes involved in
progressive fibrosis. FIZZ1 knockout mice were created to evaluate
the effects of FIZZ1 deficiency on BLM-induced pulmonary
fibrosis. The FIZZ1 deficient mice showed significant impairment
of pulmonary fibrosis in response to BLM treatment. Moreover
induced FIZZ1 overexpression using an adenoviral construct
exacerbated fibrosis thus confirming that FIZZ1 is a profibrogenic
factor in pulmonary fibrosis.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Induction of Pulmonary Fibrosis
C57BL/6 mice (8,10 weeks old) and GFP transgenic mice on
C57BL/6 background (stock# 003291) were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). To induce pulmonary
fibrosis, BLM (Blenoxane, Mead Johnson, NJ) was dissolved in
sterile PBS and instilled endotracheally on day 0 at a dose of 2 U/
kg body weight into mice as before [25]. Control groups received
the same volume of sterile PBS only. Animals (n = 3,5) were
randomly assigned to each of the indicated treatment groups. At
indicated time points after BLM treatment, the mice were
sacrificed and the lungs were harvested rapidly. All animal studies
were reviewed and approved by the Committee on Use and Care
of Animals at the University of Michigan. Where indicated,
bronchial-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected by lavaging
the lung, and total cell number from the pooled lavages was
counted using a hematocytometer. BAL cells were then cytospun
and stained with Quick Diff (IMEB Inc., San Marcos, CA) for
differential cell count. At least 500 cells were counted in 10 high￾power (4006) fields.
Generation of FIZZ1 Traditional Knockout (KO) Mice
FIZZ1 targeting vector pVBTK-FIZZ1 was custom ordered
from Vega Biolab (Eagleville, PA) (Figure 1A). The FIZZ1 59
homology arm (3.5 kb) that is upstream from exon 1 and the 39
homology arm (4.6 kb) that is downstream of exon 4 (129 s6/SvEv
mouse DNA) were inserted into targeting vector pVBTK
containing a neomycin resistance gene. This targeting vector was
confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion prior to linearization
(by I-Ceu) and electroporation into W4 ES cells. A region of
3.1 kb including all four FIZZ1 exons was replaced by a neomycin
gene cassette. ES cell clones with successful homologous recom￾bination were screened by Southern blotting with Afl II digestion.
Wild type (WT) and KO alleles generated 26 kb and 10 kb
fragment, respectively (Figure 1B). The 449 bp Southern blotting
probe that located downstream of the 39 homology arm was
generated by PCR (forward primer 59-TCTGGTCACACTTG￾CATTCC-39; reverse primer 59-AAAAAGGTGTGCGTTC￾CATT-39). Three independent homologous-recombinant ES
clones were injected into C57 BL/6 blastocysts and chimera mice
were generated. Heterozygous were produced by breeding these
chimera mice with C57 BL/6 WT mice. Genotyping was
identified by PCR (Figure 1C). Primers for a 525 bp FIZZ1
fragment in WT allele were: forward primer 59-
GAATGGGTGGGTAGGGAAGT-39, and reverse primer 59-
CAGGAAGAGCTGGCATAAGG-39. Primers for a 351 bp
neomycin fragment in KO allele were: forward primer 59-
GTGCTCGACGTTGTCACTGAAGCGG-39, and reverse
primer 59-GATATTCGGCAAGCAGGCATCG-39. Heterozy￾gous offspring was backcrossed to C57BL/6 WT mice for at least
7 generations. Homozygous KO mice were generated by breeding
the heterozygous KO mice. ES homologous recombination,
blastocyst microinjection, and generation of chimera mice were
performed by the Transgenic Core at the University of Michigan.
Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by endotracheal BLM injection as
described above. Where indicated, blood was collected from the
heart, and serum samples were then prepared using serum
separator tubes (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Generation of GFP-bone Marrow (GFP-BM) Chimera Mice
GFP-bone marrow (BM) chimeras were generated by trans￾plantation of BM cells from GFP transgenic mice to lethally

irradiated WT recipient mice as previously described [26]. Six
weeks after transplantation, pulmonary fibrosis was induced by
endotracheal BLM injection as described above, and 21 days later
the lungs were removed for analysis of GFP+ BM cell recruitment.
Construction of Adenoviral FIZZ1
The rat FIZZ1 cDNA fragment (,500 bp) was inserted into
Hind III and EcoRI sites of the Ad5 shuttle vector pACCMV2. A
full-length E1, E3 deleted recombinant adenovirus was then
generated (Figure 2) in conjunction with the Vector Core of the
University of Michigan using in situ loxP recombination between
the shuttle vector (linearized by PmeI) and cAd5-deltaE3.LoxP
cosmid containing the Ad5 backbone (linearized by ClaI) in the
presence of Cre recombinase [27]. The resulting recombinant
adenoviral DNA was then transfected into HER911 cells.
Recombinant clones were identified as plaques in soft agar
culture, and then verified by real time RT-PCR. Large scale high
titer adenoviral purification, particle determination (particles/ml),
and titer determination (plaque formatting units (pfu)/ml) were
performed in the Vector Core. 108 pfu/rat was endotracheally
injected into rats alone or combined with BLM. Empty adenovirus
without FIZZ1 (AdCont) were used as control.
Isolation of Lung AECs and Fibroblasts
Rat type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) were isolated by
elastase digestion and IgG panning as previously described [28].
The cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and then
plated onto 6-well tissue culture dishes pre-coated with fibronectin
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Fibroblasts were isolated from
lung tissues and maintained in culture as described previously [25].
Fibroblasts between passages 3 to 5 after primary culture were
used.
qPCR and Western Blotting Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from lung fibroblasts, AECs and lung
tissues after indicated treatments. The following primers and
probes were used: rat a-SMA: forward primer (59-
GTGGAGGTTGTTGCCAATATGAT-39), reverse primer (59-
TGATGATGCCGTGTTCTATCG-39), and probe (6FMA) (59-
CCTGACCCTGAAGTAT-39); mouse a-SMA forward primer
(59-CTGGAGAAGAGCTACGAACTGC-39), reverse primer (59
CTGATCCACATCTGCTGGA AGG-39), and probe (FAM) (59
CTGACGGGCAGGTGA-39). Primers and probes for FIZZ1,
type I procollagen, MCP-1, TERT, IL-4 and GAPDH were
purchased from Applied Biosystems. One-step RT-PCR was
performed by using 100 ng of total RNA as template. The mRNA
levels were normalized to GAPDH signal.
Total protein was isolated from cultured mouse lung fibroblasts
(MLF) and snap-frozen mouse lung tissues using RIPA lysis buffer
(Pierce, Rockford, IL). The following primary antibodies were
used: anti-rat FIZZ1 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), anti-a￾SMA (Sigma), anti-rat or mouse type I collagen (Biodesign
International, Saco, ME), and HRP-conjugated anti GAPDH
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
Hydroxyproline Assay
Lung collagen deposition was estimated by measuring the
hydroxyproline (HYP) content of whole lung homogenates as
previously described [29,30]. The results were expressed as mg
HYP per lung.
BM Cell Isolation and Migration Assay
Mouse BM cells were isolated from femurs and tibias by
aspiration and flushing. Where indicated, BM-derived dendritic
cell (BMDC) were induced with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF (R&D
Systems), and purified with MACS system using CD11c microbe￾ads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Both CD11c+ and CD11c2
cells were collected where indicated. For cell migration assay,
16106 BM or BMDC cells were pre-stained with a fluorescent dye
Calcein AM (BD Biosciences), and then placed into inserts with
5 mm of pore size in 24-wel transwell Boyden chamber (Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). FIZZ1 was added into the lower
chamber at the indicated concentration. After 2 hours of
incubation, fluorescence was read at Ex494/Em517 using
Spectramax Gemini XS Microplate Spectrofluorometer (Molecu￾lar Devices, Menlo Park, CA).
Flow Cytometry Analysis
The lung cells were stained with CD11c-PE conjugates (BD
Biosciences), and then CD11c and GFP positive cells were
analyzed by FACS Caliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean6SE unless otherwise
indicated. Differences between means of various treatment and
control groups were assessed for statistical significance by ANOVA
followed by post hoc analysis using Scheffe´’s test for comparison
between any two groups. A P value ,0.05 was considered to
indicate statistical significance.

Results
FIZZ1 Deficiency Impaired BLM-induced Pulmonary
Fibrosis
FIZZ1 KO mouse was generated on C57BL/6 background as
described in the Methods. These FIZZ1 KO mice were fertile and
did not show gross anatomic abnormalities compared with their
WT littermates. There was no significant difference between KO
and WT littermates in their body weights, major organ weights,
blood cell counts, as well as some serum chemistries tested
including glucose, triglycerides, insulin, lipase, albumin, etc (data
not shown).
To investigate further the implicated profibrogenic role of
FIZZ1 in vivo, the effects of FIZZ1 deficiency on BLM-induced
pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated. As expected, WT mice
exhibited significant BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis with more
than 80% elevation in whole lung collagen content as determined
by hydroxyproline (HYP) assay at day 21 after BLM injection
(Figure 3A). This increase was significantly reduced to ,30% in
FIZZ1 KO mice, which was not statistically significant relative to
the PBS-treated KO mice. Furthermore lung type I collagen and
a-SMA mRNA (Figure 3B) and protein (Figure 3C) levels showed
similar differences between WT and KO mice. Thus significant
BLM-induced increases in type I collagen and a-SMA expression
in WT mice were significantly reduced in KO mice after BLM
injection, consistent with the reduced fibrosis noted on the basis of
lung HYP content. Moreover the reduced a-SMA suggested
significantly reduced myofibroblast differentiation in the FIZZ1
KO mice. The effects on lung inflammatory and fibrogenic
cytokine expression revealed significant reduction as well in the
FIZZ1 KO mice when compared to the WT responses to BLM
treatment. Thus the expected BLM induction of all cytokines
analyzed (IL-4, IFN-c, MCP-1, TNF-a, FIZZ2) observed in WT
mice was markedly diminished in FIZZ1 KO mice (Figure 3D). Of
special note were dramatic reductions in MCP-1 and FIZZ2
mRNA levels (.70% inhibition). These significant reductions in
fibrosis and cytokine expression were accompanied by significant
reduction in BLM-induced increase in accumulation of BAL cells.
The total BAL cell (Figure 3E) and macrophage (Figure 3F)
numbers counted at day 7 after BLM treatment were significantly
elevated relative to those in PBS treated controls in WT as
expected, but were significantly reduced in FIZZ1 KO mice.
These results indicated that FIZZ1 deficiency significantly reduced
pulmonary fibrosis, possibly by reducing lung myofibroblast
differentiation, inflammatory cell recruitment and inflammatory/
fibrogenic cytokine expression.
FIZZ1 Recruitment of BM-derived Cells and Macrophages
BM derived cell recruitment to the lung is essential for fibrotic
responses in that tissue [26,31,32,33,34,35]. Some of these cells
express type I collagen, c-kit and TERT. FIZZ1 was recently
reported to have a chemotactic effect on eosinophils and
macrophages [16] and its overexpression in alveolar epithelial
cells recruits CD11c+ cells to the lung [18]. To evaluate a possible
role of FIZZ1 in recruitment of BM-derived cells in BLM-induced
pulmonary fibrosis, whole mouse BM cells isolated at 7 days after
BLM treatment were analyzed for their migratory response to
FIZZ1 in a Boyden chamber assay. The results showed significant
migratory activity to FIZZ1 by BM cells isolated from both PBS
and BLM-treated animals (Figure 4A). Interestingly, migratory
activity was greater in the cells from PBS treated control mice,
suggesting either desensitization from prior in vivo stimulation by
the induced FIZZ1 in BLM-treated mice, or the depletion of
responsive cells due to prior recruitment to the lung in vivo as a
result of BLM treatment, as previously suggested [35]. This
migratory response to FIZZ1 remained even after the BM cells
were treated with GM-CSF to induce differentiation to CD11c+
dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Figure 4B). To evaluate the in vivo
relevance of these findings, the effect of FIZZ1 deficiency on BM
recruitment to the lung was assessed in the BLM model using GFP
BM chimera mice to allow tracking of BM cell movement using
their GFP marker (20). Analysis of lung cells at day 7 after PBS or
BLM injection revealed the presence of two distinct subpopula￾tions of GFP-positive cells, one with low level GFP expression (R2
in Figure 4C) and another with high GFP expression (R3 in
Figure 4C). BLM treatment caused an increase only in the high
GFP subpopulation while the low GFP subpopulation remained
unchanged. However this BLM-induced increase in the high GFP
subpopulation was not observed in FIZZ1 KO mice, which had
also been similarly transplanted with BM from GFP transgenic
mice with intact FIZZ1 gene. Thus FIZZ1 expression by the
recipient mice was essential for recruitment of BM cells. At day 14
after BLM injection similar reduction in the number of high GFP
cells in FIZZ1 KO lungs was seen in comparison with BLM
injected WT lungs (data not shown). Based on the forward light
scatter, these high GFP expressing cells appeared to be larger than
the low GFP expressing cells. Thus BLM-induced lung FIZZ1
expression played a role in the recruitment of BM cells. This was
consistent with the results from analysis of circulating FIZZ1 level
in the FIZZ1 KO mouse serum, which showed significant
elevation (42.5% above that in PBS controls in circulating FIZZ1
levels in BLM treated WT mice at day 21 (Figure 4D). This
elevation in circulating FIZZ1 could mediate the recruitment of
the BM cells into the lung. In contrast FIZZ1 was undetectable in
serum samples from both PBS and BLM-treated FIZZ1 KO mice,
thus confirming FIZZ1 deficiency in the KO mice with
consequent impairment of BM cell recruitment to the lung
(Figure 4C). Given that FIZZ1 was chemotactic to BMDCs
(Figure 4B), the high GFP positive cells were examined for their
expression of CD11c by flow cytometry. The results revealed that
.95.53% of this population were positive for CD11c (data not
shown). Finally, the possible migratory effect of FIZZ1 on lung
fibroblasts was evaluated as described for BM cells. The data
showed that FIZZ1 also stimulated fibroblast migration
(Figure 4E), suggesting a potential role in formation of fibroblastic
foci.
To evaluate if BMDCs could be a source of the induced lung
cytokine expression associated with this BLM model, the
expression of MCP-1, FIZZ1 and IFNc were evaluated in
CD11c+ BMDCs. The results showed that the profibrogenic
cytokines MCP-1 and FIZZ1 were expressed mainly in CD11c+
BMDCs with much lower levels of expression in the CD11c
negative BM cells (Figure 5). In contrast expression of the
antifibrogenic cytokine IFNc was predominantly in CD11c
negative BM cells, being .8-fold higher than in CD11c+ BMDCs
(Figure 5).
Since these studies of BM cell recruitment to the lung were
conducted using donor GFP transgenic mice with intact FIZZ1
gene (i.e. wild type with respect to FIZZ1), they afforded the
opportunity to evaluate the effect of WT BM reconstitution on
BLM-induced fibrosis in FIZZ1 KO mice. The results showed that
transplantation of WT BM from GFP mice failed to significantly
alter the deficient pulmonary fibrosis in the FIZZ1 KO recipient
mice (Figure 6). These results together demonstrated that FIZZ1
deficiency impaired BM cell recruitment and pulmonary fibrosis,
which could not be corrected by transplantation of wild type BM
since lung-derived FIZZ1 remained deficient.

FIZZ1 Overexpression Induced Myofibroblast
Differentiation and Pulmonary Fibrosis
To further confirm the importance of FIZZ1 in myofibroblast
differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis, a FIZZ1 adenovirus
(AdFIZZ1) was produced to evaluate its effects in vivo. Endotra￾cheal injection of AdFIZZ1 (109 pfu) caused significant up
regulation in lung tissue FIZZ1 mRNA, which persisted up to as
long as 14 days after injection (Figure 7A). Consistent with mRNA
induction, FIZZ1 protein was also induced by AdFIZZ1 injection
at day 21 (Figure 7B). This enhanced FIZZ1 expression was not
seen with injection of control adenovirus (AdCont). When animals
treated with BLM plus AdFIZZ1 (108 pfu), significant enhance￾ment in FIZZ1 expression was noted at days 1 and 7, which
became insignificant on day 14 after BLM treatment (Figure 7C).
This enhancement of lung FIZZ1 expression was accompanied by
significant enhancement in type I collagen expression (Figure 7D)
as well as a-SMA mRNA and protein levels (Figures 7E and 7F,
respectively). These findings complemented the results using
FIZZ1deficient mice by demonstrating that FIZZ1 overexpression
could enhance fibrosis. FIZZ1 had no significant effects on type II
alveolar epithelial cells (AEC II) expression of a-SMA, collagen I
and the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin, or apoptosis (data not
shown). Thus FIZZ1 did not induce epithelial-mesenchymal￾transition (EMT) or alter epithelial cell survival in mediating its
effects on fibrosis.
Discussion
Multiple lung disorders, including the various interstitial lung
diseases, can result in significant chronic progressive fibrotic lung
disease, and in certain cases such as IPF, it is a progressive and
fatal disorder. Fibrotic lesions are characterized by the presence of
fully differentiated myofibroblasts, which are a key cellular source
of extracellular matrix [20,21,24]. In the case of IPF, factors
produced by repeatedly injured alveolar epithelial cells are thought
to be responsible for recruiting adjacent fibroblasts to form distinct
fibrotic foci containing myofibroblasts. Therefore understanding
the potential role of such factors that may mediate interaction
between epithelial cells and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts in the
formation and expansion or progression of fibrotic foci may be
insightful in understanding the overall pathogenesis of these
fibrotic disorders. Given that FIZZ1 is a cytokine secreted mainly
by alveolar epithelial cells, it may function as an effector cytokine
mediating the communication between injured epithelial cells and
fibroblasts. In addition to TGFb1, FIZZ1 is recently identified as
another inducer of myofibroblast differentiation in pulmonary
fibrosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that FIZZ1 was
able to induce pulmonary fibrosis in vivo through induction of
myofibroblast differentiation, which is consistent with its in vitro
function on myofibroblast differentiation [11]. BLM-induced lung
fibrosis was impaired in FIZZ1 deficient animals, while its
overexpression exacerbated fibrosis. FIZZ1 was also found to
promote migration of BM cells in vitro, and its deficiency in vivo
resulted in diminished recruitment of BM derived cells into BLM￾injured lungs. Since BM cells are essential for pulmonary fibrosis
[26,33], FIZZ1-mediated BM cell recruitment to the lung might
represent an additional mechanism by which it could promote
fibrosis.
FIZZ1 is reported to play significant roles in pulmonary
inflammation, airway and vascular remodeling in animal models
of allergic inflammation and pulmonary hypertension via
upregulating proinflammatory mediators, such as MCP-1, and
recruiting inflammatory cells such as macrophages/monocytes in
the lung [9,10,13]. FIZZ2 (or RELMb), another FIZZ/RELM
family member, is also shown to promote airway and lung
remodeling in the mouse lung by increasing perivascular and lung
collagen deposition [29,36]. These findings suggest that FIZZ1 is a
proinflammatory and profibrogenic cytokine in many different
inflammatory and remodeling processes. Moreover FIZZ1 has an
anti-apoptotic effect on mouse lung fibroblasts mediated in part
through ERK signaling [15,37], thus promoting genesis of the
myofibroblast by preservation or enhanced survival of its
progenitors. Additionally, FIZZ1 has the capacity to promote
lung cell proliferation, including pulmonary microvascular endo￾thelial cells and smooth muscle cells via an AKT-dependent
pathway [8,9]. Both these functions of FIZZ1 should result in
enlarging the pool of cells with the capacity for activation by
FIZZ1 itself plus other factors, such as TGFb, and subsequent
differentiation to myofibroblasts.
An additional role for FIZZ1 is suggested by its reported ability
to promote migration of BM-derived cells in conjunction with
evidence for the importance of such recruited cells in pulmonary
fibroproliferative and vascular disorders [17]. Thus intraperitoneal
injection of FIZZ1 induces a local inflammatory response and
significantly increases the accumulation of eosinophils and
lymphocytes, but not neutrophils [16]. Conditional (CCSP-driven)
overexpression of FIZZ1 in lung epithelial cells also resulted in
recruitment of CD11c+ dendritic cells [18]. Consistent with the
latter finding, in the present study FIZZ1 was shown to promote
migration of CD11c+ BMDCs in vitro, while the BLM-induced
recruitment of CD11c+ cells to the lung was abrogated in FIZZ1
deficient mice, similar to that seen in FIZZ2 deficient mice [29].
Indeed, FIZZ1 can bind to lung CD45+CD11c+ dendritic cells in
a fungal allergen (Alternaria) induced asthma model, in addition to
collagen-1 producing CD45- fibroblasts [38]. FIZZ1 can stimulate
the production of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in lung
resident cells [9], suggesting that it could also indirectly attract
BM-derived cells by increasing production of chemoattractants
(such as SDF-1) in the fibrotic lung. In the present study, BLM￾induced increase in numbers of macrophages/monocytes in
bronchial-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was significantly reduced
in FIZZ1 deficient mice, which paralleled the marked reduction of
BLM-induced lung MCP-1 expression, one of the most potent
chemokines that attract and activate monocytes in many
inflammatory disease processes [39]. These findings together
suggested that in addition to a direct mechanism, FIZZ1
contribution to the BM-derived cell recruitment, may also be
mediated by indirect effects on chemoattractants production, such
as MCP-1 and/or SDF-1 in lung resident cells.
In this study, most of the recruited BM-derived cells appeared to
be CD11c+ cells, which were the primary source of MCP-1 in
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover FIZZ1 deficiency
significantly reduced this recruitment, which was associated with
reduction in lung cytokine (including MCP-1) expression and
pulmonary fibrosis. These findings suggested that the reduction in
BM cell recruitment might be a factor in the reduced fibrogenic
group was shown. The lung RNA from day 7 after PBS (CON) or BLM treatment was also analyzed for cytokines mRNA expression by qPCR (D). Results
were expressed as 22DDCT. The values were expressed as percentages of their respective PBS control. The numbers of total BAL cell (E) and BAL
macrophage/monocyte (F) were counted at day 7 of BLM or PBS treated WT or FIZZ1 KO mice. Data were shown as mean 6 SE (n = 7 mice for total
BAL cell, 4 mice for macrophage/monocyte).

cytokine expression with consequent reduction in fibrosis. Such a
possibility is supported by previous studies showing the importance
of CD11c+ DC in fibrosis in diverse tissues. Thus in a mouse
model of liver fibrosis, hepatic CD11c+ DCs expand 5-fold,
inducing TNF-a, MCP-1 and IL-6 expression in co-cultured NK
cells, with effects on inflammation, cell proliferation as well as
fibrotic response. DC depletion completely abrogates the elevated
levels of many inflammatory mediators that are produced in the
fibrotic liver [40]. Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 feedback on the
function of the airway DCs and epithelial cells to directly or
indirectly (via DC-activating cytokines like TSLP) stimulate DCs
in a STAT6-dependent way [41,42]. Interestingly IL-4 induces
alternative activation of BMDC and peritoneal DCs in vitro and
in vivo with significantly elevated level of FIZZ1 expression. These
IL-4 induced FIZZ1-expressing DCs in turn prime the Th2
response. Moreover this study demonstrates that DC-derived
FIZZ1 is required for optimal Th2 cytokine secretion [43].
Additionally, impaired DC function is associated with significant
reduction in bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis [44], while
elevated numbers of DCs in IPF lung have been reported [45].
The totality of these findings provides ample evidence to suggest
that expanded numbers of CD11c+ DCs in fibrotic tissue could
play a role in fibrogenesis.
The present study together with our previous studies [11]
suggest that FIZZ1 is a potential profibrogenic cytokine, and was
positively associated with the Th2 response. However two recent
studies suggest that FIZZ1 is a repressor for the Th2 response
[46,47]. In a mouse lung granuloma model induced by Schistosoma
mansoni (Sm) eggs, FIZZ1 KO mice exhibit elevated expression of
pathogen-specific CD4+ T cell-derived Th2 cytokines, including
IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, which is accompanied by increased size of
egg-induced granuloma and fibrosis compared with their WT
counterparts [46]. Similarly, pulmonary granuloma formation
after infection of Sm eggs is exacerbated in the absence of Retlna
gene with enhanced number of granuloma-associated eosinophils
[47]. However, another study shows that FIZZ1 expression level is
enhanced in exacerbated Sm egg-induced granuloma formation in
TLR-9 KO mouse [48]. Moreover intranasal administration of
recombinant FIZZ1 during granuloma formation significantly
enhances collagen deposition in both WT and TLR-9 KO mice,
even though there is no clear differences in granuloma size and
Th1/Th2 cytokine profile in the granulomatous lungs [48],
indicationg the lack of a suppressor effect on either Th1 or Th2
responses. Furthermore, in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-
induced colitis model, FIZZ1/RELM-a administration exacer￾bates colitis and recruits eosinophils to the peritoneum [16]. More
recent evidence suggests FIZZ1 leads to airway eosinophilia,
increases thickness of the airway epithelium, and peribronchial
fibrosis [38]. The basis for these opposite findings on the potential
role of FIZZ1 in regulation of Th2 immune responses is unclear,
but may be related to differences in experimental approaches and
models studied. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the FIZZ1 KO
mouse produced in the present study was different from the one
used in the two cited studies of pulmonary granuloma models
Figure 4. FIZZ1 effects on BM cell recruitment. (A) Fresh isolated whole BM cells from day 7 BLM (‘‘BLM-BM’’) or PBS (‘‘CON-BM’’) treated mice
were preloaded with fluorescent dye, and then plated into 5 mm-inserts in 24-well transwell plates. After 2 hours of incubation with the indicated
doses of FIZZ1 in the lower chambers, the cells that have migrated to the lower chambers were quantitated by measuring the fluorescence with an
excitation and emission wavelengths of 494 and 517 nm, respectively. The results were normalized to the controls and expressed as percentages of
controls, and shown as mean 6 SE (n = 3). In (B) purified BM-derived DC from day 7 BLM (‘‘BLM-BMDC’’) or PBS (‘‘CON-BMDC’’) treated mice were
similarly analyzed as in (A) for migration to media only (‘‘None’’) or to 50 ng/ml FIZZ1 in the lower chambers. The results were expressed as in (A). (C)
BM from GFP transgenic mice were transplanted into WT or FIZZ1 KO mice to create GFP BM chimera mice of the respective recipient strain. After
stable engraftment the mice were treated with BLM and 7 days later were analyzed for GFP expression in the lung cell population by flow cytometry.
Three populations were discerned corresponding to the cells with undetectable (R1), low (R2) or high (R3) GFP fluorescence. One representative data
was shown from two individual experiments, and the combined lung cells from two mice were used for flow cytometry in each group. Circulating
FIZZ1 protein was measured in the sera (1:50 dilution) by ELISA assay 21 days after BLM or PBS treatment (D). Results were shown as mean 6 SE with
5–6 mice in each group. (E) Effect of FIZZ1 on migration of primary cultured mouse lung fibroblasts was also analyzed as described in legend for (A).

showing a Th2 inhibitor role for FIZZ1 [46,47],wherein the gene￾targeted allele contains a reporter gene, LacZ, which was lacking in
the FIZZ1 target construct in this study. Thus the expression of b￾galactosidase due to the expressed LacZ gene in the KO mice in
that study might influence the findings in the studies suggesting a
Th2 inhibitor role for FIZZ1 [46]. Further study may be needed to
clarify these controversial observations.
The cognate receptor for FIZZ1 on target cells, such as the
fibroblast, remains to be identified. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK)
is suggested to play a role in mediating FIZZ1 chemotactic activity
for myeloid cells [49] as the functional binding partner of FIZZ1.
FIZZ1-induced myofibroblast differentiation requires intact Notch
signaling, which appears to be mediated by the induction of the
Notch ligand, Jagged1 [14]. Thus diverse pathways appear to be
activated upon exposure of a variety of cell types to FIZZ1, which
suggest that indirect mechanisms via different ligands may be
involved in some of these responses. The human ortholog of
rodent FIZZ1 has yet to be identified. Recent reports suggest the
possibility that human FIZZ2 may present the human counterpart
of rodent FIZZ1, especially at the functional level [50]. Human
FIZZ2 is highly induced in the lungs of patients with IPF, and
could be up-regulated in human small airway epithelial cell line by
Th2 cytokines [29], suggesting a potential role for FIZZ2 in
pathogenesis of IPF.
In summary, the present study suggested that FIZZ1 is a
multipotential profibrogenic cytokine through induction of myo￾fibroblast differentiation, recruitment of BM-derived cells and
induction of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in
the cytokine networks.
