Abstract
There is a significant organ shortage in the field of liver transplantation, partly due to a high
discard rate of steatotic livers from donors. These organs are known to function poorly if
transplanted but make up a significant portion of the available pool of donated livers. This
study demonstrates the ability to improve the function of steatotic rat livers using a combina￾tion of ex situ machine perfusion and a “defatting” drug cocktail. After 6 hours of perfusion,
defatted livers demonstrated lower perfusate lactate levels and improved bile quality as
demonstrated by higher bile bicarbonate and lower bile lactate. Furthermore, defatting was
associated with decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased
expression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Rehabilitation of mar￾ginal or discarded steatotic livers using machine perfusion and tailored drug therapy can sig￾nificantly increase the supply of donor livers for transplantation.
Introduction
Liver transplantation remains the only cure for end-stage liver disease. However, there contin￾ues to be a significant organ shortage with approximately 14, 000 patients on the waitlist and
8,000 liver transplants performed annually [1]. Central to the donor organ shortage is the high
discard rate of procured or potentially procurable organs, with nearly 3,000 livers discarded
per year [2]. As a result of the obesity epidemic in the United States and Europe, nearly half of
procured livers are discarded due to excessive macrosteatosis related to non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) [3].

Steatotic livers are particularly prone to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)[4]. As a result,
transplantation of livers with moderate (30–60%) or severe (>60%) macrosteatosis is associ￾ated with increased early allograft dysfunction (EAD) or primary non-function, and decreased
long-term graft survival [5, 6]. Further contributing to IRI is acute-on-chronic oxidative stress,
compromised hepatic microcirculation, and an inability to recover from an energy-depleted
state [7–10].
The application of ex situ machine perfusion technology to liver resuscitation and rehabili￾tation has not only decreased the organ discard rate, but expanded the ability to use marginal,
extended criteria, or even discarded livers for transplantation without compromising patient
and graft survival [11, 12]. Using machine perfusion as a platform for targeted intervention
paves the way for salvage of otherwise discarded organs for potential transplantation. One
application of this technology involves salvaging steatotic livers. Over 10 year ago, our group
reported for the first time in the literature a combination of agents capable of “defatting” and
reversing key biochemical deficiencies in steatotic hepatocytes in culture [13–15]. Boteon and
colleagues recently showed that the same cocktail decreases fat content and improves perfu￾sion parameters in discarded steatotic human livers [16]. However, the safety and utility of sev￾eral components of the cocktail have not been confirmed or have been abandoned for human
clinical use [17]. We therefore performed a mechanistic study in a rat liver perfusion model to
identify pathways targeted by these agents, with the ultimate goal of replacing them with agents
developed in the interim 10 years that are safe for human clinical use.
Methods
Preparation of perfusate
Baseline (plain) perfusate consisted of high-glucose Dulbecco’s Minimum Eagles’ Medium
supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 2% v/v penicillin-streptomycin, and 3% w/v
bovine serum albumin. The original development of the defatting cocktail in vitro [13, 14] and
its subsequent cytotoxicity testing in cell culture models [15] have been previously described.
Defatting cocktail agents include 10 uM forskolin, 1uM GW7647, 1uM GW501516, 10 uM
scoparone, 10 uM hypericin, 0.4 ng/ml visfatin, 0.8 mM L-carnitine, and additional amino
acids [13, 14]. Defatting perfusate consisted of plain perfusate supplemented with defatting
cocktail. Perfusate and cocktail component details are provided in the Supplemental Methods
in S1 File.
Isolated liver perfusion
Lean (Fa/fa) and obese (fa/fa) male Zucker rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA)
aged 12–16 weeks and group housed in pairs in a conventional room under standard condi￾tions (21ºC room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycles, mixed paper/cellulose bedding).
Rats had free access to standard chow and autoclaved water. Animal studies were approved by
the institutional animal use and care committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital and
Shriners Hospital for Children and comply with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Ani￾mals as outlined by the National Academy of Sciences. After induction of anesthesia with
3–5% isoflurane, a transverse laparotomy was made. The common bile duct was partially tran￾sected, cannulated with 28-gauge PTFE tubing, and secured with 4–0 silk sutures. 0.3 mL of
1000U/mL heparin was injected into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and after 3 minutes of circu￾lation, the hepatic artery was ligated with 7–0 silk. Next, the portal vein was cannulated with a
16-gauge catheter, followed immediately by transection of the IVC. The liver was then flushed
slowly with 50 mL of ice-cold 0.9% saline via the portal cannula while the rat was simulta￾neously euthanized by exsanguination under isoflurane gas anesthesia. Following cold flush,

the liver was freed from its ligamentous attachments and transferred to the perfusion basin to
be perfused ex situ. Total cold ischemic time was less than 10 minutes.
Three groups of six rats were used. 6 livers from lean rats (LL) underwent plain perfusion,
acting as positive control. 6 livers from obese rats (SL) underwent plain perfusion as negative
controls, and 6 livers from obese rats underwent defatting perfusion (DSL).
The perfusion reservoir contained 500 mL of perfusate. A roller pump system (Masterflex
L/S, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) was used to propel perfusate through a combination heat
exchanger-oxygenator, exposed to a gas mixture of 1-2L/min of 5% CO2/95% O2 at 37º Cel￾sius, and a bubble trap, before perfusing the liver via the portal vein cannula. A filter was not
used in the circuit. Pump flow rate was titrated to a portal perfusion pressure of 10–12 mm Hg
measured via water column. Outflow from the liver IVC was collected in the liver basin and
returned to the perfusion reservoir for recirculation. Livers were perfused for 6 hours. Perfus￾ate samples were taken from the liver basin immediately after initiation of perfusion, at 30
minutes, and at each hour. Bile was collected and sampled at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours. Livers were
weighed immediately before and after perfusion. The study flowchart is represented in S1 Fig.
Histologic evaluation
After 6 hours of perfusion, duplicate biopsies were taken from the left lateral lobe and the right
medial lobe. One set was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis and one set was
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. The liver tissue was sectioned in 5-micron slices,
mounted on glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Oil red staining was also per￾formed on sectioned frozen liver tissue. Histopathologic assessment was carried by two blinded
pathologists. An image guide previously reported by Hall et al. was used to increase accuracy
and interobserver concordance [18]. Estimated fat proportionate area (FPA) was used to evalu￾ate macrosteatotic changes in the liver by examination at 4x and subsequently confirmed at 20x
magnification. Microsteatosis was quantified under 20x magnification. Discordant cases were
reviewed collectively, and consensus obtained for the final interpretation reported.
Perfusate and bile analysis
Perfusate and bile samples were collected as above and stored at -80˚C for future analysis.
Assays for ketone bodies (MAK134, Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA), triglyceride
(MAK266, Millipore-Sigma), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL; MAK045, Millipore￾Sigma), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; TR70121, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT; TR71121, Thermo Fisher), were performed on perfusate samples per
the manufacturer’s instructions. Biochemistry and blood gas measurements were performed
on bile and perfusate samples using a point-of-care handheld device (iSTAT CG4+ and
Chem8+ cartridges, Abbott Laboratories, NJ). Oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was calculated as:
OUR ¼ V½CO2;inflow  CO2;outflow�
liver weight
where V is the perfusion flow rate (mL/min) and CO2 is the oxygen concentration. CO2 was cal￾culated as 0.0031�
PO2, where PO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen (mmHg) and 0.0031 (mL
O2/(mmHg�
dL)) is the solubility of oxygen in aqueous solutions at 37˚C [13].
Determination of mRNA levels with quantitative RT-PCR
Frozen liver tissue from the left lateral lobe of liver was crushed under liquid nitrogen. Total
RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions

(Qiagen, Waltham, MA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse transcribed and quanti￾tative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using rat Fatty Liver RT2 Profile PCR Array
(Qiagen) on an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 reader. Target gene expression was normalized to
that of the SL group. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the ΔΔCt
method [19] and transformed to represent fold change.
Targeted metabolite analysis
Frozen tissue biopsies at end-perfusion were pulverized (~25mg) and analyzed for energy
cofactors using a targeted multiple reaction monitoring analysis on a 3200 triple quadrupole
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (QTRAP LC/MS-MS) system (AB Sciex, Foster
City, CA), as previously described [20]. Adenosine tri-, di-, and mono- phosphate (ATP, ADP,
AMP), nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NADH/NAD+
), and nicotinamide adenine nucleo￾tide phosphate (NADPH/NADP+
) tissue levels were quantified and pertinent redox ratios
were calculated. Energy charge was defined as [ATP + ADP�0.5]/[ATP+ADP+AMP].
Statistical analysis
Independent continuous data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
When the ANOVA reached significance, individual t tests were performed between groups
[21]. Repeated measures data were analyzed using a random intercept mixed model with a cat￾egorical effect of time, a categorical effect of group, and the group by time interactions. Data
are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise indicated. A P
value of 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical tests were performed using Stata v15
(StataCorp, College Station, TX), and graphics were created using Prism 8 (GraphPad, San
Diego, CA).
Network analysis
Network analysis was performed and visualized in Cytoscape [22] with the ReactomeFIViz
application which interfaces with the Reactome Functional Interaction database [23]. The net￾work was created using expression data from all genes examined with quantitative RT-PCR
(gene set). Linker genes that shared two or more functional interactions with individual targets
from the gene set were included to ensure that none of the genes investigated were excluded
from the functional network due to a lack of direct interaction.
Results
Steatotic livers demonstrate improved function during defatting perfusion
DSL and SL groups had a similar rise in perfusate lactate content during the first two hours of
perfusion, while the LL group had a significantly slower rise as compared to the SL group.
After 2 hours of perfusion, DSL livers began clearing lactate, which became significantly lower
at hours 4 through 6, compared to the SL group (Fig 1A). Similarly, the anion gap of the per￾fusate increased initially in all three groups but decreased significantly in the LL and DSL
groups starting at the 2nd hour of perfusion compared to the SL group (Fig 1B).
Defatting perfusion improves the quality of synthesized bile
Bicarbonate levels in bile produced by DSL livers were significantly higher compared to the SL
group at each measurement point (Fig 2A). Interestingly, DSL livers demonstrated the ability
to clear lactate content in collected bile after 6 hours of perfusion compared to persistently ris￾ing levels seen in SL livers (Fig 2B). Bile lactate levels in the LL group were notably lower

throughout perfusion. DSL and SL groups made similar volumes of bile per gram of liver tissue
(37.4 ± 10.5 vs. 42.0 ± 14.8 uL/g, P = 0.58), while LL produced significantly higher volumes
(128.7 ± 28.2 uL/g, P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Fig 2C).
Defatting perfusion associated with decreased pro-inflammatory signaling
DSL livers demonstrated decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory mediators nuclear fac￾tor kappa B (NF-κB; fold change 0.61 ± 0.09, P = 0.005) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-α; .47 ± .04, P = 0.025) compared to the SL group (Fig 3). Interleukin-1 beta expression
(IL-1β; 0.46 ±.09, P = 0.052) was decreased in DSL livers but did not reach significance com￾pared to the SL group. Interleukin-6 expression was significantly lower compared to LL livers
(IL-6; 0.49 ± 0.18, P = 0.004), but not to the SL group (0.75 ± 0.13, P = 0.14). DSL livers had

decreased expression of apoptotic markers caspase 3 (CASP3) and Fas cell surface death recep￾tor (FAS/CD95), compared to the LL group only. Interleukin-10 expression, an anti-inflam￾matory cytokine, was increased in the DSL group but did not reach significance compared to
the SL group (IL-10; 1.87 ± 0.48, P = 0.18).
Defatting perfusion modulates lipid metabolism
The change in perfusate ketone body content, a marker of fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), was
significantly higher at 4 and 6 hours of perfusion in DSL and LL groups compared to SL.
Defatting perfusion resulted in a modest decrease in tissue triglyceride content (54.3 ± 8.2 ng/
uL) compared to SL livers (65.8 ± 7.7, P = 0.3). Perfusate triglyceride content after 6 hours of
perfusion in the DSL group (88.4 ± 10.2 ng/uL) was significantly higher than the LL group

(53.7 ± 9.4, P<0.05), but less than the SL group (163.8 ± 30.9, p<0.05). Perfusate content of
combined VLDL/LDL after 6 hours of perfusion in the DSL group (74.3 ± 7.4 ug/uL) was sig￾nificantly lower than LL (127.1 ± 2.2, P<0.001) and SL groups (115.3 ± 10.7, P = 0.01) (Fig

Defatting perfusion upregulates fatty acid β-oxidation
Compared to the SL group, there was significantly increased hepatic gene expression of mito￾chondrial fatty acid β-oxidation markers acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1; fold change 1.98 ± 0.13,
P<0.001) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2; fold change 1.80 ± 0.17, P = 0.004),
though CPT1a and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL) expression did not reach
significance (Fig 5). SL and DSL groups demonstrated similar hepatic expression of genes asso￾ciated with fatty acid synthesis (ACACA, ACLY, ACSL5, FASN, SCD1), while the LL group
demonstrated lower expression. Apolipoprotein B (APOB) expression was significantly higher
in DSL (fold change 1.43 ± 0.14, P = 0.026) and LL groups (1.64 ± 0.14, P = 0.002) compared

were no significant differences gene expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis between DSL and SL groups. Lean livers demonstrated overall decreased

to SL livers, though expression of apolipoprotein -A1, -C3, and -E (APOA1, APOC3, APOE)
was unchanged (S1 Table). Interestingly, lean livers had an unexpectedly higher VLDL/LDL
perfusate content, indicating the high synthetic capacity of these livers to produce lipoproteins
for transport, further supported by the significantly increased gene expression of HMGCR
(fold change 2.85 ± 0.65, P = 0.013 compared to DSL group), the rate-limiting enzyme in the
cholesterol synthesis pathway. Fig 6 demonstrates network analysis of genes differentially
expressed in DSL compared to SL livers.
Macrosteatosis decreases with plain and defatting perfusion in rat model
Prior to perfusion, steatotic rat livers were expected to have at least 30% macrosteatotic con￾tent, though steatosis varied widely between rats of the same age based on visual inspection.
After 6 hours of perfusion, all 6 SL livers had <30% macrosteatosis (range 0–27.5%) versus 5
DSL livers (range 2.5–35%, P = 0.3). Macrosteatosis in the LL group ranged 0–1% after perfu￾sion. Quantified macrosteatotic droplets by oil red staining did not differ between SL
(551 ± 181 droplets/mm2
) and DSL livers (611 ± 125, P = 0.8). Representative histology from
each group is shown in Fig 7.
Defatting perfusion does not improve synthetic function but is associated
with hepatoxicity
Hepatic synthetic function as indicated by the change in weight-adjusted perfusate albumin
was significantly higher in the lean livers, but similar between SL and DSL groups (Fig 8A).
Similarly, there was no significant difference in the OUR between SL and DSL livers, but both
has significantly lower OURs compared to LL livers (Fig 8B). At end-perfusion, AST and ALT
levels were significantly higher in the DSL group compared to both SL and LL groups (Fig 8C
and 8D).
Defatting perfusion depletes available pool of energy cofactors
Despite improved functional biomarkers in the DSL group, defatting perfusion resulted in sig￾nificantly depleted ATP:ADP, ATP:AMP, and energy charge ratios compared to lean livers
(Fig 9A–9C). NADH:NAD+ ratios were comparable between groups, though NADPH:NADP+
ratios were higher in the SL (0.088 ± 0.015) and DSL groups (0.059 ± 0.014) and compared to
the LL group (0.028 ± 0.002, P<0.05 for both) (Fig 9D and 9E).
Steatotic rat livers demonstrate insulin resistance, worsened by defatting
perfusion
Perfusate glucose levels increased in both SL and DSL groups during perfusion, but at a signifi￾cantly higher rate in the DSL group (S2A Fig). The LL group glucose content remained signifi￾cantly lower throughout perfusion. DSL livers also had significantly increased expression of
the gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase 4 (PDK4), compared to both SL and LL groups, which may be an adverse effect of preg￾nane X receptor (PXR) activation by hypericin. Interestingly, DSL livers had higher insulin
receptor (INSR) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) expression than both SL and LL
groups despite higher perfusate glucose content. Of note, peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor (PPAR) -α and–β/δ gene expression was not significantly increased in the DSL group
(S1 Table). Finally, during 6 hours of perfusion, LL and SL perfusions had similar perfusion
flow rates, while DSL perfusions experienced slightly lower flow rates to maintain similar

SL livers, which lost weight (6.5 ± 3.4 g versus -1.9 ± 1.2, p<0.001).

ideal application of this platform. A recent proof of concept study by Boteon et al. using the
defatting cocktail reported here, demonstrated its effectiveness in improving functional
parameters and decreasing macrosteatosis in discarded human steatotic livers [16]. Because of
concerns with safety in humans of several components, we performed a mechanistic study in a
rat liver perfusion model in order to identify agents safe for human clinical trials with the
potential to perform the same functions. We corroborated the prior report of improved func￾tional parameters and bile quality with defatting cocktail but demonstrate notable off-target
and adverse effects related to the cocktail components that can be optimized in future studies.
For example, visfatin was thought to be an insulin-mimetic signaling protein, yet the origi￾nal manuscript describing its action has been retracted [26]. Other studies characterize its
function as a pro-inflammatory cytokine found in higher levels with worsening steatosis [27,
28]. Hypericin, a component of St. John’s wort, activates PXR and upregulates enzymes
involved in drug metabolism, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) [29]. PXR activation
is associated worsening steatosis and insulin resistance, though it does have anti-inflammatory

activity through downregulation of NF-κB target genes [30]. CYP3A4 is also involved in
metabolism of numerous drugs, including tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which has implica￾tions for post-transplant immunosuppression regimens. Other cocktail components are effica￾cious at increasing FAO but lack safety data in humans. PPAR-α agonist, GW7647, and
PPAR-β/δ agonist, GW501516, demonstrate notably upregulated downstream effects in this

study and prior ones, but have never been used in humans. Similarly, forskolin and scoparone
are herbal extracts with reported anti-inflammatory and steatosis-reducing effects in animal
studies but have not been rigorously tested in humans [30–32]. Carnitine, an over-the-counter
supplement, appears to be the only safe and effective component of the cocktail that can be
used in future studies [14]. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of NAFLD and NASH
has greatly improved in the last decade, and clinicians are now on the verge of a new era were
pharmaceutical therapy is becoming available for the treatment of these diseases [33].
The defatting cocktail in this study does demonstrate effectiveness in targeting several path￾ways. Most remarkable is the downregulation of pro-inflammatory targets TNF-α and NF-κB
in defatted compared to untreated livers. The overall anti-inflammatory effect of the defatting
cocktail is consistent with reported mechanisms of several components, including activation
of PPAR-α and -β/δ (GW7646, GW501516), PXR (hypericin), and constitutive androstane
receptor (CAR; scoparone) [30]. Another upregulated pathway involves mitochondrial FAO.
We found that ketone body production, a marker of FAO, was significantly higher in the DSL
group compared to the SL group. This is further supported by increased expression of CPT2
and ACOX1 genes, key enzymes involved in mitochondrial FAO. Given the safety concerns of
the cocktail components, it is worth examining recently-developed drugs under clinical trial
that target similar pathways. Elafibranor, a dual PPAR-α/δ agonist, has demonstrated efficacy
in decreasing inflammation (via NF-κB targets) and increasing FAO by upregulating expres￾sion of CPT1α and ACOX1 [34, 35]. In an international, randomized, double-blind placebo￾controlled trial of patients with NASH, elafibranor significantly reduced liver injury enzymes,
lipids, glucose profiles, and markers of systemic inflammation. Treatment also resulted in
greater resolution of NASH than placebo and was well-tolerated [36]. Other drugs with similar
target profiles include pioglitazone, a PPAR-γ agonist that demonstrated improvement in stea￾tosis and lobular inflammation in a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of adults
with NASH [37]. Another commonly used lipid-lowering agent, bezafibrate, has pan-PPAR
agonist activity and reduced hepatic steatosis and gluconeogenesis [38, 39].
One novel finding in this study was that despite increased expression of APOB, DSL livers
had lower perfusate VLDL/LDL levels compared to SL livers at end-perfusion. The lower
VLDL/LDL levels in the DSL group appears to indicate a process that favors decreased exocy￾tosis of low-density lipoproteins, allowing these molecules to be potentially used for energy
metabolism. In the same clinical trial above, elafibranor decreased serum triglyceride and LDL
cholesterol levels, increased HDL cholesterol levels, while decreasing liver steatosis, demon￾strating potential efficacy for improving the lipid profile and metabolism of steatotic livers dur￾ing machine perfusion [36].
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor in the same class of the PPARs, has
become well-defined in recent years as another metabolic target in the treatment of NASH.
The defatting cocktail used in this study did not demonstrate a significant change in gene
expression of FXR (S1 Table). In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, obeticholic
acid (OCA; a synthetic FXR agonist) improved steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis [40], indi￾cating potential efficacy if used in the ex situ perfusion setting.
With respect to steatotic liver content, the question as to whether complete defatting is nec￾essary during perfusion to produce a liver viable for transplantation remains unanswered. The
lack of a significant difference in macrosteatosis content between SL and DSL groups, despite
notable functional improvement, indicates that complete “defatting” or achieving macrostea￾tosis content below 30% is not the primary outcome of lipid-modulating perfusion. Rather,
rehabilitating steatotic livers to function with the characteristics of lean, viable livers should be
the goal. This is further corroborated by data from discarded human steatotic livers, which

demonstrated improved function and viability in livers that were not defatted to below 30%
macrosteatosis after 12 hours of perfusion [16].
There were several limitations to this study. A pre-perfusion liver biopsy was not obtained,
making paired comparisons of macrosteatosis and triglyceride content pre- and post-perfusion
not possible. Furthermore, defatted livers experienced an unexpected increase in weight dur￾ing perfusion while plain-perfused steatotic livers had a weight decrease. This was likely due to
a portal perfusion pressure that was too high. It is not known why this affected the defatted liv￾ers and not the control steatotic livers, though endothelial injury related to the cocktail is a pos￾sibility. Another limitation of the rat liver perfusion model is that macrosteatosis decreases in
steatotic livers undergoing plain perfusion as well, a finding that is present in the porcine
model, but not humans [41, 42]. This may have made any further defatting stimulated by the
cocktail difficult to detect by global methods such as histology. It may be that the rat liver per￾fusion model is exceedingly efficient at inducing metabolism of intracellular lipid droplets or
they are being degraded via other mechanisms. Finally, we did not assess in vivo function of
the control and defatted livers after perfusion using a rat liver transplantation model. This was
done in an effort to reduce the number of animals needed while still obtaining novel data to
allow further refinement of the drug cocktail prior to scaling up to animal transplantation
studies. Future investigations should evaluate the optimized, clinically applicable drug cock￾tail’s impact on IRI, including mechanisms of complement, ROS release, and liver immune
activation in a rat liver transplantation model with improved generalizability, such as diet￾induced steatosis, longer cold ischemia, and added warm ischemia.
Conclusion
Lipid modulation of steatotic rat livers using a drug cocktail that targets mitochondrial fatty
acid oxidation is able to improve liver function and bile quality, in addition to decreasing
macrosteatosis content. Further research using safe, clinically applicable drugs interventions is
required prior to initiating human clinical trials.
