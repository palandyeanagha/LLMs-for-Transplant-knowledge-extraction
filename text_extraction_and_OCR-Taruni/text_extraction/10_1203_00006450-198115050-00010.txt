ventricle. The infusion sequence of the isotopes was randomly 
assigned. The method for the infusion and analysis of micro￾spheres has been described in detail (25). Starting just before the 
microsphere infusion, samples were simultaneously withdrawn 
into counting vials under oil from both femoral artery catheters 
and the jugular venous catheter by a four-channel Harvard pump 
at a rate of 2.06 ml/min for 3 min. The disintegrations per minute 
in the arterial reference samples were determined and used for the 
calculation of cardiac output and regional blood flows, whereas 
the jugular venous samples were used to evaluate the magnitude 
of cephalic arteriovenous shunting of microspheres. Cardiac out￾put, organ blood flows, and cephalic arteriovenous shunting were 
calculated as previously described (8). 
Changes in intraesophageal pressure were monitored continu￾ously in two lambs in the CPAP study and in five lambs in the 
CNP study. A latex esophageal balloon. 4 cm long and with linear 
responses over the range of pressures measured, was positioned in 
mid-esophagus and filled with 0.5 ml of air. The average intrae￾sophageal pressure was determined at each level of pressure and 
is reported as the percentage of change from the initial control 
and the percentage of airway pressure transmitted. The latter was 
calculated as the ratio of the change in intra-esophageal pressure 
to the level of CPAP or CNP applied times 100. 
The lambs were killed at the end of each experiment with the 
injection of a saturated KC1 solution into the left ventricle and 
immediately dissected for tissue preparation. The following organs 
were removed and weighed: brain, eyes, heart, liver, spleen, kid￾neys, and gastrointestinal tract. In the CNP group, adrenal glands 
and thyroid were also removed. Tissues and organs were placed 
directly into preweighed counting vials or, in the case of larger 
-Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measured 
analysis of variance followed by Student Newman-Keuls multiple 
comparison procedure. Nonpaired t test was used to compare 
baseline data from the two groups of lambs. Reported differences 
were considered significant at the 5% level. All mean values are 
reported as * S.E. 
RESULTS 
The baseline data from the two groups of newborn lambs have 
been compared to determine if the animals were similar, thereby 
permitting us to compare the results obtained. Although the 
weights of the lambs at the time of study were similar. 4.2 + 0.5 
kg in the CPAP group and 4.0 + 0.5 kg in the CNP group, the 
former group were slightly older. 5.6 + 0.6 days (3 to 8 days) 
versus 3.8 * 0.5 days (2 to 7 days), respectively (P < 0.05). Other 
baseline values obtained during the initial control period for both 
groups of lambs are presented in Tables I to 4. Arterial blood 
gases and pH were normal in each group, indicating apparently 
normal ventilatory and acid-base balance. There was no statistical 
difference in cardiac output, heart rate, left ventricular pressure, 
central venous pressure, and the majority of organ blood flows. 
However, there were significant differences. P < 0.05, in blood 
flows to the gastrointestinal tract, heart, and spleen. and in jugular 
venous pressure. These values were higher in the CNP group of 
animals in each instance. No significant differences were observed 
between the sequences of application of either endotracheal-CPAP 
or CNP. We, therefore, have grouped the data from each study

ENDOTRACHEAL-CPAP GROUP 
The hemodynamic changes observed in the lambs during CPAP 
breathing are presented in Table 1. Arterial Po2, Pco~, and pH 
were unchanged, as were heart rate and mean left ventricular 
pressure. Cardiac output decreased 42 f 19 ml/min - kg during the 
application of 6 mm Hg, a fall of 16% (P < 0.05). At l l mm Hg, 
cardiac output fell 47 f 28 ml/min-kg, or 15%, when compared 
to initial control values (P < 0.05). When airway pressure was 
returned to zero at the end of each study, cardiac output returned 
to values that were not different from the original control mea￾surements. CVP progressively rose with the application of increas￾ing airway pressure. rising 3.9 + 1.4 mm Hg (44%) during the 
application of 6 mm Hg and 5.0 +- 1.6 mm Hg (77%) with ll mm 
Hg (P < 0.05). CVP returned to initial control values when airway 
pressure was removed. JVP responded in a similar fashion; how￾ever. the magnitude of change was not as great, increasing 2.4 f 
1.4 mm Hg at 6 mm Hg (0.10 > p > 0.05), and 3.7 f 1.1 mm Hg 
at I I mm Hg (P < 0.05). JVP also returned to a level similar to 
the initial control measurement in the final control period. 
Blood flows to the organs evaluated during endotracheal-CPAP 
are presented in Table 2. No significant alteration was observed 
in blood flows to the spleen, heart, brain, head, or left eye at either 
level of airway pressure when compared to control values. Al￾though blood flow to the total gastrointestinal tract was unaltered 
at 6 and 11 mm Hg when compared to the initial control, there 
was a tendency to fall at the higher airway pressure, values being 
significantly lower than those obtained at 6 mm Hg. To further 
evaluate this, blood flows to specific areas of the gastrointestinal 
tract were analyzed. We found no significant alterations in blood 
flow to the small bowel, large bowel, or stomach. Renal blood 
flow also was unaltered at 6 mm Hg, but fell 0.22 ? 0. l 1 ml/min 
g or 14% during the application of I I mm Hg. This decrease in 
renal blood flow was of borderline statistical significance when 
compared to the initial control flow (0.10 > P > 0.05). but was 
significantly lower than blood flow at 6 mm Hg (P < 0.05). 
Hepatic blood flow fell during the application of both 6 and 11 
mm Hg pressure (P < 0.05). 
CNP BREATHING 
The cardiovascular changes observed during CNP breathing 
are presented in Table 3. Arterial Pon, Pco2, and pH remained 
unchanged, as did heart rate, mean left ventricular pressure, and 
jugualr venous pressure. Cardiac output fell 29 + 15 and 24 f 19 
rnl/min. kg from initial control values during the application of 
-6 and -1 1 mm Hg, respectively. This represents a fall of ap￾proximately 9% at both pressure settings, neither of which are 
statistically significant. When CNP was returned to zero at the 
end of eadh study, cardiac output reached values greater than the 
original control (P < 0.05). Central venous pressure progressively 
fell with higher levels of CNP, decreasing 2.2 f 0.7 mm Hg (20%) 
at a pressure of -6 mm Hg, P > 0.05, and 3.1 ? 0.9 mm Hg (43%) 
at -1 I mm Hg, P < 0.05. During the final control period, CVP 
returned to a level similar to that observed in the initial control 
period. JVP was 9.1 f 0.5 mm Hg before the application of the

oxygenation may have reflected an improvement in lung compli￾ance, which in turn would have allowed greater transmission of 
airway pressure. 
Although CVP rises with CPAP, it has been observed to fall 
during CNP (26). In the present study, its fall paralleled the 
changes in intrapleural pressure. JVP, on the other hand, was not 
altered. However, the level of JVP during the control period was 
greater than that observed with endotracheal CPAP and most 
likely is due to the tight application of the neck diaphragm 
necessary for the proper function of the ventilator. This is sub￾stantiated by the 43% increase in JVP that was seen after applying 
the diaphragm. The high JVP maintained during CNP also may

reported a deterioration in renal function, as measured by urea 
clearance and urine output, in both normal and sick adults during 
continuous airway pressure breathing (6, 20). The removal of 
airway pressure in these studies resulted in rapid improvement of 
renal function. Our finding of a prompt return of renal blood flow 
to control values after the removal of CPAP may explain these 
observations. 
Although there was not a statistically significant change in 
blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract during the application of 
endotracheal CPAP, there was a tendency to decrease at the higher 
airway pressure. Similarly, blood flow was found to fall during 
the application of -6 mm Hg CNP, when cardiac output also had 
fallen slightly. In this case, the alteration in organ blood flow is 
greater than the measured fall in cardiac output. In either case, 
this may be accentuated in the presence of hypovolemia, shock, or
