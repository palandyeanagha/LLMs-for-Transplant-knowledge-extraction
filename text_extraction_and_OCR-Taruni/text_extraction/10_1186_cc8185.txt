Abstract
Introduction Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a potential vasopressor
treatment for hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis. However, unlike
other vasopressors, its systemic, regional blood flow and renal
functional effects in hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis have not
been investigated.
Methods We performed an experimental randomised placebo￾controlled animal study. We induced hyperdynamic sepsis by
the intravenous administration of live E. coli in conscious ewes
after chronic instrumentation with flow probes around the aorta
and the renal, mesenteric, coronary and iliac arteries. We
allocated animals to either placebo or angiotensin II infusion
titrated to maintain baseline blood pressure.
Results Hyperdynamic sepsis was associated with increased
renal blood flow (from 292 +/- 61 to 397 +/- 74 ml/min), oliguria
and a decrease in creatinine clearance (from 88.7 +/- 19.6 to
47.7 +/- 21.0 ml/min, P < 0.0001). Compared to placebo, Ang
II infusion restored arterial pressure but reduced renal blood
flow (from 359 +/- 81 ml/min to 279 +/- 86 ml/min; P < 0.0001).
However, despite the reduction in renal blood flow, Ang II
increased urine output approximately 7-fold (364 +/- 272 ml/h
vs. 48 +/- 18 ml/h; P < 0.0001), and creatinine clearance by
70% (to 80.6 +/- 20.7 ml/min vs.46.0 +/- 26 ml/min; P <
0.0001). There were no major effects of Ang II on other regional
blood flows.
Conclusions In early experimental hypotensive hyperdynamic
sepsis, intravenous angiotensin II infusion decreased renal
blood while inducing a marked increase in urine output and
normalizing creatinine clearance.
Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects 5 to 7% of all hospitalized
patients [1] and independently increases mortality and the
cost and complexity of care. Sepsis is the leading cause of
ARF in the intensive care unit and septic ARF occurs most
commonly in critically ill patients [2]. The mortality of septic
ARF remains high despite the application of renal replacement
therapies and other supportive treatments [1,3].
The cardiovascular hallmark of severe sepsis is hypotension,
which is widely held to cause reduced renal blood flow (RBF)
leading to AKI [4-6]. However, in recent animal studies repro￾ducing the hyperdynamic sepsis typically seen in critically ill
humans, RBF was found to be increased [7,8]. In this setting,
despite renal vasodilatation and a marked increase in RBF, ani￾mals still developed oliguria and decreased creatinine clear￾ance [9]. These findings concur with the limited studies of
RBF in human sepsis [10,11]. They suggest that afferent and
even greater efferent arteriolar vasodilatation may occur in
early hyperdynamic sepsis. If this were true, selective vasocon￾striction of the efferent arteriole with angiotensin II (Ang II) in
this setting may be physiologically logical and safe and may
attenuate renal dysfunction.
Ang II is a powerful vasoconstrictor hormone that causes a
preferential increase in efferent arteriolar resistance [12]. It
has been rarely used in hyperdynamic sepsis [13,14] due to
concerns about its possible deleterious effects on regional
AKI: acute kidney injury; Ang II: angiotensin II; CO: cardiac output; CVP: central venous pressure; FENa: fractional excretion of sodium; GFR: glomer￾ular filtration rate; MAP: mean arterial pressure; RBF: renal blood flow.

blood flow and renal function. However, there are no studies
of its effects on regional blood flows when administered by
continuous infusion to restore blood pressure in hyperdynamic
hypotensive sepsis. More relevant, there are no studies to con￾firm whether its potential adverse effects on renal blood flow
are functionally important. To address these limitations in our
knowledge and given the rationale that selective efferent arte￾riolar vasoconstriction may be desirable in this setting, we con￾ducted a randomized controlled animal study and measured
the systemic and regional hemodynamic effects and the renal
functional effects of Ang II infusion compared with placebo in
an animal model of hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis.
Materials and methods
Animal preparation
Experiments were completed on eight adult Merino ewes
(weighing 35 to 50 kg), housed in individual metabolic cages.
Experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Exper￾imentation Ethics Committee of the Howard Florey Institute,
Melbourne, Australia, under guidelines laid down by the
National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.
Prior to the studies, sheep underwent three aseptic surgical
procedures, each separated by two weeks. Anesthesia was
induced with intravenous sodium thiopental (15 mg/kg) and,
following intubation, it was maintained with 1.5 to 2.0% isoflu￾rane/oxygen. In the first stage, sheep were prepared with bilat￾eral carotid arterial loops. In two further operations, sheep
were implanted with flow probes as previously described
[7,8]. Briefly, transit-time flow probes (Transonic Systems Inc.,
Ithaca, NY, USA) were implanted on the ascending aorta (20
mm) and the left circumflex coronary artery (3 mm). Two weeks
later, they were inserted around the mesenteric artery (6 mm),
the left renal artery (4 mm), and the left external iliac artery (6
mm). Antibiotics (0.4 g procaine benzyl penicillin, 0.5 g dihy￾drostreptomycin sulphate (Norbrook Laboratories, UK) were
administered prophylactically for three days post-surgery.
Post-surgical analgesia was maintained with intramuscular
injection of flunixin meglumine (1 mg/kg; Mavlab, Brisbane,
Australia) at the start of surgery, and then 4 and 16 hours post￾surgery.
Experiments commenced at least two weeks after surgery and
were conducted on conscious sheep. On the day prior to the
experiments, arterial and venous cannulae were inserted as
described previously [7,8]. Cannulae were connected to pres￾sure transducers (CDX III. Cobe, Denver, CO, USA) tied to the
wool on the sheeps' backs. Pressures were adjusted to
account for the height of the transducers above the heart. A
bladder catheter was inserted for urine collection.
Data from the flow probes were collected via flow-meters
(Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA). The use of chroni￾cally implanted transit-time flow probes for the accurate meas￾urement of regional blood flow has been described previously
[15,16]. Analog signals for mean arterial pressure (MAP), cen￾tral venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO) and RBFs
were collected at 100 Hz for 10 seconds at 1 minute intervals
throughout the experiment on a computer using custom writ￾ten software. For the figures, data were grouped into means
values for every 15 minutes.
Experimental protocol
Baseline measurements were collected for a 120 minute con￾trol period before the induction of sepsis by intravenous injec￾tion of live Escherichia coli (3 × 109 colony forming units) over
five minutes at 01.00 AM. Approximately 8 to 12 hours after
the initial bolus, animals typically reached the pre-defined car￾diovascular criteria for randomization (hyperdynamic sepsis):
10% decrease in MAP, 50% increase in heart rate and 30%
increase in CO.
After reaching the criteria for septic shock, animals were
observed for a 120 minute pre-treatment period before being
randomly assigned to receive a six-hour intravenous infusion of
either Ang II (55 ± 78 ng/kg/min, range 4.25 to 450 ng/kg/
min) or vehicle (saline). The dose of Ang II was titrated to main￾tain MAP at the pre-sepsis control level, with two of the sheep
requiring increases in infusion rate during the treatment period
to maintain MAP. Blood samples were taken the day before
the induction of sepsis, at the end of the sepsis control period,
and every two hours during the six-hour treatment period.
Urine was collected and sampled every two hours throughout
the experiment from the bladder catheter using an automated
fraction collector. The creatinine clearance (CreatinineUrine/
CreatininePlasma × UrineVolume/time) and fractional excretion of
sodium (SodiumUrine/SodiumPlasma × CreatininePlasma/Creat￾inineUrine × 100) were calculated. At the end of the experiment,
all catheters were removed and animals were allowed to
recover for 10 to 14 days before being crossed over to the
other arm of the study.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means with standard deviations and all
comparisons were performed by repeated measures analysis
of variance [17]. All analyses were performed using SAS ver￾sion 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). To correct for the
effect of multiple comparisons, only a two-sided P < 0.01 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Effects of sepsis
After administration of E. coli, all animals developed features
of sepsis: (temperature of >41°C, a respiratory rate >40
breaths per minute, use of accessory muscles of respiration,
hypotension, tachycardia, lassitude, anorexia). Two sheep
died following induction of sepsis.
The onset of severe sepsis was associated with peripheral
vasodilatation, hypotension and an increase in CO (hyperdy-

namic septic state). MAP decreased (from 86.3 ± 7.2 to 71.8
± 7.2 mmHg, P < 0.0001) and total peripheral conductance
increased (P < 0.0001; Figure 1). These changes were
accompanied by increases in CO and heart rate (Figure 1) and
a reduction in stroke volume (67.5 ± 11.6 to 46.4 ± 7.5 ml/
beats, P < 0.0001).
Sepsis caused pronounced vasodilatation in all regional vas￾cular beds with increases in renal conductance (3.4 ± 0.8 to
5.2 ± 0.9 ml/min/mmHg, P < 0.0001) and RBF (292.3 ± 60.5
to 396.6 ± 74.1 ml/min, P < 0.0001; Figure 2). There were
similarly large increases in coronary conductance and blood
flow and in iliac conductance and blood flow (Figure 3).
Mesenteric conductance and mesenteric blood flow also
increased (Figure 3).
Despite the increase in RBF during sepsis, there was a 46%
decrease in urine output (102.6 ± 38.1 to 50.5 ± 25.4 ml/h, P
< 0.01) and a 43% decrease in creatinine clearance (88.7 ±
19.6 to 47.7 ± 21.0 ml/min, P < 0.01; Figure 4). Fractional
excretion of sodium (FENa), however, did not change (0.47 ±
0.35 to 0.45 ± 0.35%, P > 0.05).
Sepsis also caused a significant decrease in partial pressure
of arterial oxygen and an increase in blood lactate but no other
biochemical changes (Table 1).
Effects of infusion of angiotensin II during sepsis
Systemic hemodynamics
Intravenous infusion of Ang II increased and maintained MAP
at baseline levels, while animals assigned to receive vehicle
remained hypotensive (Figure 1). The Ang II-induced increase
in arterial pressure resulted from peripheral vasoconstriction
with a small reduction in CO, but no significant effect on heart
rate (Figure 1).
Regional hemodynamics
Ang II infusion significantly reduced renal conductance and
RBF to 3.3 ± 1.4 ml/min/mmHg and 278.8 ± 86.0 ml/min
(both P < 0.0001), respectively, which then returned to levels

similar to those in the pre-sepsis period (3.4 ± 0.8 ml/min/
mmHg and 292.3 ± 60.5 ml/min, respectively, both P > 0.05;
Figure 2). These effects were maintained for the six hour infu￾sion, while in the vehicle group, renal conductance (5.2 ± 1.3
ml/min/mmHg) and RBF (358.7 ± 80.8 mL/min) remained ele￾vated (Figure 2). Ang II had a significant but less potent vaso￾constrictor effect on other vascular beds (Figure 3).
Renal function
Compared with vehicle infusion, Ang II infusion increased
urine output more than seven-fold (364.3 ± 272.1 ml/h vs.
48.1 ± 18.1 mL/h; P < 0.0001; Figure 4). This effect was
maintained throughout the experiment. Ang II infusion also
increased creatinine clearance to 80.6 ± 20.7 ml/min, a value
similar to pre-sepsis levels (88.7 ± 19.6 ml/min, P > 0.05),
while, in the vehicle-treated group, creatinine clearance
remained low (46.0 ± 26.0 mL/min; P < 0.0001; Figure 4).
Respiratory and acid base changes
Infusion of Ang II had no significant effects on arterial blood
gases, plasma electrolytes or acid base variables, compared
with vehicle (Table 1). However, Ang II significantly increased
FENa (0.66 ± 0.23 to 2.71 ± 2.29%, P < 0.0001).
Discussion
In a model of hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis, we examined
the systemic and regional hemodynamic effects and renal
functional effects of intravenous Ang II infusion. We found that
Ang II at a dose titrated to restore MAP to baseline levels
induced systemic vasoconstriction with limited vasoconstric￾Table 1

tive effects on the mesenteric but not coronary or iliac vascular
beds. We found, however, that Ang II decreased RBF and
renal conductance to pre-sepsis levels, while increasing urine
output, creatinine clearance and fractional natriuresis.
One of the characteristics of severe hypotensive hyperdy￾namic sepsis is peripheral vasodilatation [18,19]. However, it
has been suggested that, in sepsis, such generalized vasodil￾atation might spare the kidney such that RBF decreases due
to vasoconstriction, ischemia develops and renal function
declines [4-6]. In contrast, in our model of hyperdynamic sep￾sis, we found intense renal vasodilatation and increased RBF,
as previously reported [8,9]. Despite renal hyperemia, there
was a significant decline in renal function, as shown by the
decreased urine output and creatinine clearance. These
changes suggest a marked reduction in glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) and its major determinant, intra-glomerular capillary
pressure. The effect of Ang II on urine output, creatinine clear￾ance and natriuresis occurring in the setting of renal vasocon￾striction and decreased RBF, as seen in our study, is
consistent with the hypothesis that Ang II causes an increase
in glomerular filtration pressure, possibly through selective
efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction or changes in mesangial
cell tone or both. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
such effects in hyperdynamic sepsis. Previous animal studies
in rats demonstrated a likely role for Ang II to oppose the hypo￾tensive response to lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis [20]
and a reduced systemic pressor response to Ang II boluses at
doses similar to ours, an effect which was associated with a
variable renal vasoconstrictor response [21]. None of these
studies, however, measured the renal functional effect or sys￾temic and renal hemodynamic effect of extended Ang II infu￾sion.
The increase in urinary output, fractional natriuresis and creat￾inine clearance induced by infusion of Ang II in sepsis seems
unlikely to be simply secondary to increases in arterial pres￾sure. First, the MAP value during Ang II infusion was similar to
baseline values and yet urine output and fractional natriuresis
were much greater. Second, in previous identical studies,
norepinephrine and epinephrine infusion caused similar
increases in arterial pressure but produced much smaller and
more transient improvements in renal function than Ang II
[7,22].
The renal effect of Ang II may relate to its selective effects on
intrarenal hemodynamics, where it controls tone in the afferent
and efferent arterioles [14] and mesangial cells [23]. Infusion
of Ang II increases filtration fraction [24-26], which has been
proposed to result from a greater sensitivity of the efferent than
the afferent arterioles to its vasoconstrictor action, a notion
supported by several studies [27-32]. In contrast, the afferent
and efferent arterioles have been shown to respond similarly to
norepinephrine [27].
If Ang II is to be used in human sepsis, it is important to assess
whether this treatment has harmful effects. We found that Ang
II caused only limited reductions in blood flow to the heart, gut
or skeletal muscle. Additionally, we found no evidence of
adverse effects on electrolyte or lactate levels. Desensitization
to the effects of vasoconstrictor agents, including Ang II, in
sepsis is well established. In this study, the levels of Ang II
required to increase MAP by 20 mmHg were up to five-fold
more than the dose required in healthy animals [33]. A similar
desensitization to Ang II may occur in septic patients com￾pared with healthy humans [12,34]. This phenomenon is not
fully understood, but may result from high levels of nitric oxide
counteracting the vasoconstrictor effect of Ang II or from down
regulation of angiotensin AT-1 receptors [35].
Our study has both strengths and limitations. It is randomized
and placebo-controlled, conducted in conscious animals to
remove the confounding effects of sedation or anaesthesia.
Blood flows were measured by highly accurate probes
inserted several weeks before the experiment. Furthermore,
the renal effects of Ang II are clear, internally consistent and
kidney specific. On the other hand, the indirect measurement
of GFR by means of creatinine clearance is of limited accuracy
in the absence of a steady state. The changes we observed,
however, were marked and strongly suggestive of a true effect.
Our model does not completely reproduce severe human sep￾sis. However, the systemic inflammatory syndrome developed
and three major criteria for a hyperdynamic circulation were
present throughout the study period. The decrease in arterial
pressure and urine output and the increase in lactate meant
that our animals fulfilled the ACCP/SCCM consensus criteria
for severe sepsis [36]. The mortality rate of 25% seen in our
animals is similar to the 30% mortality rate seen in severe sep￾sis in humans. Nonetheless, the septic state in our animals
was not sustained beyond 8 to 12 hours and our observations
may not apply to prolonged or recurrent sepsis as seen in
other large animal models of sepsis [37]. In addition, our ani￾mals, unlike many septic humans, did not have old age, vascu￾lar disease, hypertension or diabetes. These differences
between our model and human sepsis must be taken into
account in the interpretation of our findings. We did not meas￾ure Ang II levels thus making it impossible to compare Ang II
levels during the natural response to sepsis with those
achieved duringAng II infusion. We did not administer fluid
resuscitation, although such resuscitation is typically per￾formed in human sepsis and might have modified our findings.
The CO and total peripheral conductance during the
untreated septic state in placebo animals showed small differ￾ences from animals allocated to Ang II. These differences may
have affected our findings. Finally, we acknowledge that
increases in blood pressure can, independent of the drug
used, induce a diuresis [38]. However, the effects fo Ang II or
renal function during sepsis were more potent than those of
doses of epinephrine and norepinephrine that caused similar
increases in arterial pressure [7,22]. It is also possible that the

combination of lower dose vasopressor drugs (multimodal
therapy) would achieve better renal protection with lower sys￾temic side effects.
Conclusions
We found that, in a large animal model of experimental hypo￾tensive hyperdynamic sepsis, infusion of Ang II at a dose that
restores MAP to pre-sepsis levels, significantly reduced RBF
and simultaneously increased urine output, fractional natriure￾sis and creatinine clearance. Ang II caused these renal
changes without major adverse effects on blood flows to other
vital organs, blood lactate or biochemical variables. These find￾ings justify further investigations of Ang II in experimental and
human sepsis.

• Experimental hyperdynamic hypotensive sepsis can be 
associated with renal vasodilatation and hyperemia 
while renal function becomes impaired
• The combination of renal vasodilatation with decreased 
GFR suggests combined afferent and efferent arteriolar 
vasodilatation with greater arteriolar dilatation
• Ang II infusion restores renal hemodynamic to normal
• Ang II-induced restoration of intra-renal hemodynamics 
to normal is associated with improved creatinine clear￾ance and a marked increase in urine output.
