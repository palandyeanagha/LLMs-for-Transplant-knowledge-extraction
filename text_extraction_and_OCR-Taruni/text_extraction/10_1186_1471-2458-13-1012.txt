Abstract
Background: The increase in life expectancy and the persistence of expectancy gaps between different social
groups in the 20th century are well-described in Western developed countries, but less well documented in the
newly industrialised countries of Asia. Singapore, a multiethnic island-state, has undergone a demographic and
epidemiologic transition concomitant with economic development. We evaluate secular trends and differences in
life expectancy by ethnicity and gender in Singapore, from independence to the present.
Methods: Period abridged life tables were constructed to derive the life expectancy of the Singapore population
from 1965 to 2009 using data from the Department of Statistics and the Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore.
Results: All 3 of Singapore’s main ethnic groups, and both genders, experienced an increase in life expectancy at
birth and at 65 years from 1965 to 2009, though at substantially different rates. Although there has been a
convergence in life expectancy between Indians and Chinese, the (substantial) gap between Malays and the other
two ethnic groups has remained. Females continued to have a higher life expectancy at birth and at 65 years than
males throughout this period, with no evidence of convergence.
Conclusions: Ethnic and gender differences in life expectancy persist in Singapore despite its rapid economic
development. Targeted chronic disease prevention measures and health promotion activities focusing on people
of Malay ethnicity and the male community may be needed to remedy this inequality.

Background
Life expectancy—the average number of years a person
would live if he or she experienced the age-specific
mortality rates of a given country in a particular year—is
one of the most widely used measures of the health status
of populations [1]. Life expectancy at birth has generally
increased worldwide since the early 20th century, with
the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa [2], where the high
prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus has, instead,
lowered life expectancy [2]. The main determinants of
this general increment include public health interventions
to prevent communicable diseases, such as vaccination
and antibiotics treatment [3,4], rising living standards,
improvements in nutrition and sanitation, progress in
healthcare and health services, access to quality health
services, lifestyle changes and education [5,6]. Women—
now—generally outlive men in developed countries
although the magnitude of this gender gap varies
considerably [7]. The gender gap in life expectancy has
been converging in most developed countries since
the late 20th century [8-10], which has been attributed
to decreasing cardiovascular and cancer mortality
(particularly lung cancer) in males, as well as narrowing
disparity in chronic disease risk factors like smoking
[9,10].
In addition, differences in life expectancy between ethnic
groups living in the same country are well-established
in the West [11,12]. In the United States, for example,
blacks in general have lower life expectancy at birth
than whites, while Hispanics appear to have higher rate
than either [11,12]. However, such data are sparse in * Correspondence: raymondlim1302@gmail.com

Asia, and life expectancy differences in subgroups in Asian
countries are not well-documented.
Disparities in life expectancy among ethnic groups
and between genders within a country often imply the
presence of health inequalities. Studies have found
important determinants to explain this variation, such
as differences in the prevalence of chronic disease risk
factors, preventive health behaviour, access to and util￾isation of healthcare service, as well as socio-economic
status [13,14].
Long-term monitoring of life expectancy by subgroups
within a country—such as ethnic groups and gender—
will provide useful information that will allow policy
makers and other stakeholders to allocate healthcare
resources, and plan health promotion programmes more
effectively.
From a British colony to an independent country after
separation from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore has under￾gone rapid economic development. Social and health
changes in life expectancy and fertility have resulted in
a concomitant demographic transition. This South-east
Asian multiethnic city-state with people of Chinese, Malay
and Indian ethnicities now faces an increasingly ageing
population [15]. Though Singapore’s 3 main races differ
substantially in their rates of diseases such as cancer [16]
and heart disease [16], their differential mortality and
life expectancy have not been studied. In this study,
we examine the secular trends in life expectancy
among gender and ethnicity groups in Singapore from
1965 (when it separated from a union with Malaysia)
to the present, a time period over which gross domestic
product per capita (2010 US$) rose from ~ US$500
to ~ US$41,000 [17].
Methods
Data on mortality from 1940 to 2010 were obtained from
the National Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore [18].
Under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act (enacted
in 1937), it is compulsory to register all births and deaths
in Singapore [19]. The National Registry is based on the
death certificate issued by a doctor following the death of
any person who dies in Singapore, regardless of residential
status. The certificate states the underlying causes of death
according to the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD) [18]. Deaths—limited to the 3 main ethnicities,
which constituted more than 96% of all deaths—were
then classified according to the 3 major mortality categor￾ies in accordance with the Global Burden of Disease Study,
World Health Organisation (WHO) [20]. Group I causes
include mortality from communicable diseases, maternal
conditions, perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies
(ICD-9 codes 001–139, 260–269, 320–322, 460–487,
630–676, 760–779); Group II, mortality from all non￾communicable diseases (all other ICD-9 codes not used for
Group I and Group III causes); and Group III, mortality
from road traffic accidents, intentional and unintentional
injuries (ICD-9 codes E800 to E999) [20].
In addition, period abridged life tables that depicted
the mortality experience of a given population were con￾structed to derive the life expectancy of the Singapore
population from 1965 to 2009. Complete life tables
cannot be compiled as population and mortality data
for every single year of age were not available. 3 essential
components were used to construct the abridged life
tables: mid-year population in each age group, the
number of deaths in each age group for each 5-year
period and the number of live births over each 5-year
period. The mid-year population was obtained from the
Department of Statistics [21], while the number of live
births and deaths were obtained from the Registry of
Births and Deaths [18]. The methodology for constructing
the abridged life tables for the Singapore population
was adopted from previous work in the demographic
literature [22-24] and all formulae used in the compu￾tation process are detailed in Appendix I. The statistical
programming language R (version 2.14.0) was used to
plot the figures [25].
Demographic information on gender and ethnicities
were taken from the National Registry which also is￾sues a birth certificate to each registered newborn in
Singapore. “Chinese” is defined as a person of Chinese
origin, who in Singapore is most commonly Hokkien,
Teochew, Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka or Foochow,
including their descendants, all of whom are classified
as Chinese [26]. “Malay” is defined as an individual
whose ancestors are from the Malay Archipelago typically
Muslim, speaking the Malay language (Bahasa Melayu)
and adhering to Malay customs [26]. “Indian” in the
Singapore context is defined as a person whose origins
are in now Bangladesh, India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka,
most commonly Tamils, Telugus, Malayalis, Punjabis and
Bengalis [26]. Singaporeans of mixed parentage have
traditionally been classified according to their father’s
ethnicity group [18] with the exception of those of mixed
European and Asian descent who were labeled during
colonial times as “Eurasian” to distinguish them from
“pure” Europeans [27].
We limit our calculation of the mid-year population to
only the 3 major ethnic groups as they made up more
than 96% of the total resident population; the other
minority groups such as Eurasians are excluded due to
small numbers (less than 4% of the total population).
The life expectancy data are then stratified according
to gender and ethnicity.
Data for these analyses were obtained from publicly
available aggregate information published by the Depart￾ment of Statistics and Registry of Births and Deaths.
No individual-level information was used, and there was

no contact with any human subjects. Ethical review was
thus deemed unnecessary for this study.
Results
Epidemiological transition of Singapore
The mid-year resident population of Singapore has
increased from 2.0 million in 1968 to 3.8 million in 2010,
of which 74-78% were Chinese, 13-15% were Malays
and 7-9% were Indians during this time period. The
predominant group of causes of mortality in 1940 and 1950
was communicable diseases (Group I), which accounted
for 57% of all deaths in 1940. This had declined to 37%
in 1960 and 15% in 1980 (Table 1), and is indicative of the
epidemiological transition that took place in Singapore
starting from the post-World War Two period. By 1980,
mortality from non-communicable diseases (Group II,
78%) far exceeded the mortality from communicable
diseases (Group I, 15%). Non-communicable diseases
(Group II) were the predominant causes of death between
1970 and 2010, representing 71% to 80% of all deaths.
In addition, the total mortality rate per 100,000 resident
population has undergone a gradual decline through
the years, consistent with increasing life expectancy in
Singapore.
Gender-differences in life expectancy
In the period from 1965 to 1969, females had a life
expectancy at birth of 71.6 years, 6.5 years longer than
males (65.1 years). The life expectancy at birth of both
genders grew between 1965 and 2009: by 2005 to 2009,
the life expectancy at birth of males was 78.9 years,
while that for females was 85.4 years. Although the rate
of increase in life expectancy was higher in males than
females in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the rate of
increase in females was greater from the late 1980s
onwards (Figure 1a and Table 2). As a result, the gap in
life expectancy between males and females (5–7 years
throughout this period) has not narrowed (Figure 1a).
Similar results were seen for life expectancy at 65 years,
with overall secular improvements in life expectancy.
In 1965, females at age 65 had a life expectancy of
14.8 years, while males had 11.0 years, a 3.8 years gap.
Again, the rate of increase in life expectancy was higher
in males than females in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
but the rate of increase in females was greater from the
late 1980s onwards (Figure 1b and Table 2). The gap in life
expectancy at age 65 in 2005 was 4.7 years (Figure 1b),
and a gap of about 3–5 years at age 65 has persisted from
1965 to 2009.
Both genders experienced a decline in mortality rate
during the period under observation. Mortality rate
gaps between both genders were seen in 1965–1969,
and have persisted. This gender gap is seen from childhood
onwards, and persists throughout the life course for all
3 periods with females having a consistently larger decline
in mortality rate (Figure 2).
Comparison of life expectancy stratified by ethnicity in
both genders
A Chinese girl born in 2005 can expect to live to
86.6 years. In contrast, a Malay boy can expect to live only
to 74.8 years, a gap of nearly 12 years. Life expectancy
for children of other ethnicity /gender combinations can
expect a life expectancy between these extremes.
The gap in life expectancy at birth between males and
females persisted after stratifying by ethnicity, with a gap of
about 5–7 years throughout this period. Further, although
life expectancy for all 3 major ethnic groups has increased
over the 50 years period, significant differences both in
the magnitude of life expectancy and rate of increases
in life expectancy are seen among ethnic groups. The
greatest overall gains in life expectancy have been by the
Indians, whose life expectancy at birth has increased by
18.8 years in females and 15.7 years in males, followed
by the Chinese, where it has increased by 13.8 years in
females and 14.2 years in males. The Malays, however,

have seen an increase of only 13.6 years in females and
11.2 years in males. Despite the 5–7 years gap between
Chinese males and females, Malay females have a life
expectancy that is slightly lower than Chinese males
from 1990 to 2009. A 2–4 years gap in the life expectancy
at birth between Malay males and Malay females, as
well as a persistent 8–11 years gap between Malay
males and Chinese females existed throughout the
period of observation from 1965 to 2009. The increase
in life expectancy experienced by both Malay males and
females exceeded that of Chinese in the 1970s, but this
increase has since dropped off and the life expectancy at
birth gap between the Chinese and Malays has widened in
recent years (Figure 3 and Table 3). It is also striking that
the gap in life expectancy at birth between Chinese and
Malay males (of about 1–3 years, widening to 5 years
in 2005) is much smaller than that between Chinese
and Malay females (of about 5–8 years). Because the
overall increases in life expectancy in these 4 groups are
relatively similar, the gap between Chinese and Malays
seen in 1965 has persisted, both in males and females.
In contrast, although Indian males and females had
the lowest life expectancy of the 3 major ethnicities in
1970s, Indian males and females have both experienced
the highest rates of increases in life expectancy at birth,
especially from 1990s onwards, such that the life expect￾ancy gap has closed from 6.9 years between Chinese and
Indian females and 1.7 years between Chinese and Indian
males in 1965, to 1.9 years in females and 0.2 years in
males (Figure 3 and Table 3).

These trends are mirrored for life expectancy at age
65, where a persistent gap is also seen between males
and females, and between Malays and the other 2 races.
Again, from the lowest life expectancy at age 65 of the 3
ethnic groups in the 1970s, Indian males and females
have experienced rapid increases in life expectancy, and
the gap between Chinese and Indians has substantially
closed. In fact, since 1985, Indian males surviving to 65
outlive their Chinese peers on average (Figure 3 and
Table 3).
Age specific mortality rates at 3 time points are plot￾ted in Figure 4. The graphs reflect the findings from the
life expectancy calculations, and the sharpest declines in
mortality rates over the 3 time points are seen in Indians
(both males and females), and the smallest declines in
Malays.
Discussion
Singapore completed its epidemiological transition—from
one that is heavily burdened by infectious diseases to
one that is dominated by chronic, non-communicable
diseases—within about 20 years (between 1950 and 1970),
similar to the experience of other newly industrialising
countries during the mid 20th century, which also under￾went the same transition over a roughly contemporaneous
period [28,29]. Singaporeans have enjoyed a steady
increase in life expectancy between 1965 and 2010.
Males and females have similar overall life expectancy
gains, accounting for the persistent gap between the
genders. Although significant increases in life expectancy
have occurred in all 3 ethnicities, the differential overall
gains have been greatest for Indians (both genders),
followed by Chinese and Malay, resulting in the conver￾gence of life expectancy gap between the Indians and
Chinese, while leaving a substantial gap between the
Malays and the other two ethnic groups.
The life expectancy gap reflects differences in ethnic
and gender-specific mortality rates, which might be
attributable to amenable mortality (consisting of both
‘treatable’ conditions such as appendicitis for which timely
therapeutic care is available, and ‘preventable’ conditions
such as lung cancer where primary preventive measures
are available) [30] leading to disparities in non-communic￾able disease deaths after Singapore has completed its
epidemiological transition, as cancer, coronary heart
disease and stroke are the 3 leading causes of mortality
across the 3 ethnic groups and gender from 1970 to the
present [16,18].
Cancer rates in 2006 to 2010 were highest in Chinese,
followed by Malays and then Indians [31]. Indians expe￾rienced a larger decrease in terms of age standardised inci￾dence rates for all cancers compared to the Chinese from
1968–1972 to 2003–2007 [32]. The Malays, on the
other hand, experienced an increase in the age standar￾dised incidence rates for all cancers during the same
time period [32].
There are also strong ethnic differences in myocardial
infarction event and case fatality rates, as well as coronary

(semi-logarithmic scale).

mortality rates among the 3 ethnic groups in Singapore,
with higher rates in Malays and Indians than the Chinese
[33,34]. The rate of decrement in crude mortality rate per
100,000 population from acute myocardial infarction was
higher for Indians than for Chinese from 2007 to 2010
[34]; the Malay did not experience such a reduction [34].
Similarly, stroke rates are highest among Malays,
followed by Indians and then Chinese [35]. However,
the rate of decrement in crude mortality rate per
100,000 population from stroke was highest for Indians
compared to the other 2 ethnic groups from 2005 to
2010 [35]. Finally, infant mortality, neonatal mortality and
perinatal mortality rates were also the highest in Malays
compared to the other 2 ethnic groups from 2008 to 2012
[36].
Disparities in the prevalence of risk factors for the 3
leading causes of mortality, such as tobacco use, hyper￾tension, hyperlipidaemia and alcohol use substantially
account for the differences in life expectancy within a
high-income country [37]. Lifestyle factors and chronic
conditions predisposing to cardiovascular disease and
cancers are more prevalent in Malays: the National Health

Survey (NHS) 1992 to 2010, a population representative
serial cross-sectional survey [38] showed that Malays
consistently have the highest prevalence of hypertension,
hyperlipidaemia, smoking and obesity among the 3 ethnic
groups. The National Nutrition Survey also showed that
Singapore’s Malays have the highest mean saturated fat
and total fat intake, as well as the lowest intake of fruits
and vegetables [39]. In addition, amenable mortality was
lowest for Chinese and highest for Malays, especially
for treatable causes [30], suggesting there are important
underlying cultural differences in health beliefs and
health seeking behaviour for the 3 ethnic groups. For
example, according to the NHS 2010, Malays consistently
have the lowest rate of screening for colorectal, breast and
cervical cancer among the 3 ethnic groups [38].
In contrast to most developed countries, we did not
observe any significant convergence in life expectancy
at birth, or at 65 years, between males and females in
Singapore [8-10]. Again, we see substantial higher mortal￾ity rates from cancers, stroke and coronary heart disease
in men compared to women. While there may be innate
biological differences between the genders that explain
this universal gender gap [9,10], factors that are amenable
to intervention account substantially for the difference in
life expectancy [37]. First, the crude prevalence of lifestyle
factors and chronic conditions that predispose to cancer
and cardiovascular disease is higher in men than women.
The NHS showed that males consistently have a higher
prevalence of smoking, hypertension, daily alcohol con￾sumption and hyperlipidaemia than do females from
1992 to 2010. For obesity and diabetes mellitus, there
was a reverse in trend for both genders. During the
1990s, women had a higher prevalence in obesity and
diabetes mellitus than did men, but by 2010, the preva￾lence of both conditions in males had overtaken that in
females.

Second, men and women in Singapore not only differ
in their preferences for certain health-related habits but
also in their attitudes towards health [40,41]. Survey
findings from the National Health Surveillance Survey
2007 showed striking gender differences in health prac￾tices with females reporting overall better health behaviour
[40,41]: they took greater conscious effort to achieve
healthy nutrition such as limiting fat-intake and eating
sufficient fruits and vegetables, were more likely to access
health care services with the onset of mild ailments, and
to have a regular family doctor whom they would consult
when they had a health problem [40,41]. Of particular
concern, the use of preventive medical services also
differed among the elderly of both genders. Screening

coverage for chronic diseases such as hypertension and
hyperlipidaemia were higher in elderly women aged 60
to 69 than in men of the same age [40,41].
Third, amenable mortality for the period 1990–1994
was markedly higher in males (age standardised rate 109.7
per 100,000 population) than in females (age standardised
rate 60.7 per 100,000 population) in Singapore [30]. This
is consistent with the phenomenon that females in
Singapore have a better health profile and are more likely
to seek healthcare services in the early stage of diseases.
We do not have data about the prevalence of modifi￾able lifestyle risk factors prior to 1992 (except smoking).
In the case of smoking, prevalence among males halved
from 1970s to the present [38,42]. Lung cancer rates in
males have also declined as a consequence, from 63.0 per
100,000 in the period 1978 to 1982 (age-standardised)
to 40.8 per 100,000 in 2003 to 2007 [42], suggesting an
impact from smoking prevalence declines. We would
expect similar impacts on cardiovascular disease rates.
Nevertheless, we did not notice a significantly greater
gain in the rate of increase of life expectancy among
males, in comparison with females. This could be due to a
few reasons. Smoking is just one of many factors that
could affect life expectancy, and females in Singapore have
seen great improvements in some of these other factors.
For example, literacy rates in women have increased from
60% in 1970 to about 96% in 2010, while the labour
participation rate has also doubled from 25% in 1970 to
more than 50% in 2010 [43]. Both these factors can
influence health literacy and increase the level of access
to healthcare services by women. There have also been
significant improvements in maternal health [44].
Our data suggest that ethnic and gender health outcome
inequalities persist in Singapore, and modifiable factors
account for a substantial part for these differences. Cul￾turally appropriate and sensitive evidence-based inter￾ventions organised both by government agencies (for
example the Health Promotion Board) and voluntary
welfare organisations targeted at males and the Malay
community will be useful to reduce the life expectancy
gaps that we have identified in this paper. Further
research may be needed to understand the perception
of risk and reasons for health-related behaviour (such
as smoking), in order to develop effective interventions.
Such interventions will also need to be delivered through
appropriate channels that are accessed by and acceptable
to the target population.
Limitations
We highlight several limitations that may affect the
interpretation of our results. First, our life expectancy
measurement does not take into account the number of
healthy life years lived. Health is a state of complete
physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity, as defined by the WHO
[45], and an increasing life expectancy does not necessarily
mean extra years of good health. It is therefore important
to take into account both quantity and quality of life by
considering the use of a more suitable indicator such as
health adjusted life expectancy (HALE), which is the
number of healthy years (free from disability or disease)
that a person born in a particular year can expect to live
based on current trends in deaths and disease patterns
[46]. The currently available data in Singapore do not
allow the quantification of HALE, unfortunately.
Second, our numerator data included all mortality in
Singapore, regardless of nationality status. This would
have comprised deaths of non-Singapore citizens and
non-Permanent Residents (PRs). The mid-year population,
which formed the denominator, consisted however of
only Singapore citizens and PRs. Though we are unable
to remove the mortality contributed by foreign non-PRs,
or to obtain the corresponding denominators including
them, we believe this proportion is small as most foreign
non-PRs working in Singapore are of working age when
mortality is low. We do not believe that this inclusion of
non-Singaporean, non-PR should affect the conclusions
of our study, since the likely effect of this inclusion is to
“inflate” the mortality rate in Chinese and Indians (which
are large sources of non-Singaporean, non-PR persons in
Singapore) relative to that of Malays. In addition, we could
not differentiate between ‘native-born Singaporeans’ and
‘naturalised Singaporeans’ who are born outside Singapore
but then become a Singapore PR or citizen in our ana￾lysis. However our objective in this paper is to evaluate
changes in life expectancy of the Singapore population
over time regardless of their place of birth, and as such we
do not view this distinction as critical.
Third, period life expectancy is used in this study rather
than cohort life expectancy. Period life expectancy can be
interpreted as the mean age at death that is experienced
by a real cohort under the assumption that age-specific
mortality rates observed during that period apply to that
cohort [47]. Cohort life expectancy, on the other hand,
summarises the mortality experience of an actual birth
cohort of individuals as they age over time, from birth
until the cohort becomes extinct through the death of
the last survivor [45]. Though it is technically easier and
faster to report period life expectancy, the limitation is
that period life expectancy will not reflect cohort changes
in life expectancy accurately in the case that age-specific
mortality rates are changing over time [48]. This was
observed when there was a sudden peak in the life
expectancy among Indian males around year 2000. We
believe that one of the reasons for this sudden peak
might be the surge of PRs in the Indian male resident
population. The proportion of Indian male PRs doubled
from 9.5% in 1990 to 18.0% in 2000, which corresponds to
Lim et al. BMC Public Health 2013, 13:1012 Page 9 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/13/1012

the largest increment among the ethnic-gender combina￾tions in Singapore for that period. This ‘healthy migrant’
effect where immigrants are on average healthier than
the native-born [49] can cause a sudden change in mortal￾ity rates and life expectancy, and the use of period life
expectancy will not be able to reflect this well.
Conclusions
In summary, we find ethnic and gender specific differences
in life expectancy at birth and at 65 years in Singapore that
have persisted between 1965 and 2009 due to differential
rates in life expectancy gain. Modifiable factors account
for a substantial part for these differences. Health pro￾motion activities targeted at at-risk communities (males,
Malays) to address these modifiable factors could reduce
these differences.
Appendix I: formulae used in the computation
process of life expectancy from 1965 to 2009
Age-specific mortality rate
The age-specific mortality rate nMx can be computed
using nDx, the number of deaths occurring to persons
aged x to x+n throughout the 5-year period, and nPx,
the number of persons years lived by persons aged x to
x+n throughout the 5-year period [22-24]. Since each
length of period under consideration is 5 years, we
multiply the number of persons aged x to x+n alive at
the mid-point of the period by five to get nPx. For most
age groups, n=5 as the population is categorized into
5-year age groups, except for the youngest two age
groups (< 1 and 1 – 4) and the oldest age group (75+),
nMx¼nDx=nPx:
Probability of dying between age x and x + n
Assuming that deaths are spread evenly across the 5-year
period, the probability of dying, nqx,, for the general age
groups is
nqx ¼ 2nnMx=ð2 þ nnMxÞ:
However, for infants, deaths tend to be concentrated
at the first few months of life. Hence, the assumption
that deaths are spread evenly across the observed period
does not hold. Considering this factor, the infant mortality
rate is used instead of the above equation. For persons
aged 0 to 1, we have
1q0 = 1D0 /B, where B = number of live births over
the 5-year period.
For the open-ended oldest age group, ∞qx = 1 as everyone
in this age group will eventually die without entering
another age group [22-24].
Number of survivors at age x
The radix of the life table, l0, is set at 100,000. The number
of persons expected to be alive at age x, lx, is derived based
on the formula
lx ¼ lx−n – lx−nnqx−n ð Þ:
Number of deaths between age x and x + n
The number of persons expected to die between age x
to x+n, ndx, is obtained by multiplying the number of
survivors at age x, lx, by the probability of dying between
age x to x+n, nqx. That is,
ndx ¼ lxnqx:
Number of person-years lived between age x and x + n
For non-infants, assuming that deaths are uniformly dis￾tributed within the age interval and across the 5-year
period, nLx, the number of person-years lived within age x
and x+n by survivors at age x is computed as
nLx ¼ ð Þ n=2 ð Þ lx þ lxþn :
For infants, the above formula is modified using separ￾ation factors to allocate different weights to l0 and l1. As
the majority of deaths occur within the first few months
of life, a smaller weight of 0.3 is given to l0, while a larger
weight of 0.7 is given to l1. These values are adapted from
Coale-Demeny equations [Coale A. J. and P. Demeny,
1983, Regional Model Life Tables and Stable Populations,
2nd edition, Academic Press, New York]. The number of
person-years lived within age 0 and 1 by survivors at age 0
is computed as
1L0 ¼ 0:3 lð Þþ 0 0:7 lð Þ1 :
For the open-ended oldest age group, the number of
persons dying in the period above age x must be equal
to the number of persons surviving to age x (∞dx = lx), so
∞Lx ¼ lx=ð Þ ∞Mx :
Total person-years lived above age x
The total number of person-years expected to be lived
by survivors at age x, Tx, is calculated by summing the
number of person-years lived, nLx, from the oldest to the
youngest age [22-24].
Tx ¼ ∑∝
α¼xnLa
Life expectancy at age x
The average number of years which a person alive at age
x is expected to live, ex, is obtained by dividing the total

the number of survivors at age x [22-24].
