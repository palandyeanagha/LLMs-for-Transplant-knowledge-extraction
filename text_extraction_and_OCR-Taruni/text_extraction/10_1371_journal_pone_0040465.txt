Abstract
Hepcidin, a liver-derived iron regulatory protein, plays a crucial role in iron metabolism. It is known that gender differences
exist with respect to iron storage in the body; however, the effects of sex steroid hormones on iron metabolism are not
completely understood. We focused on the effects of the female sex hormone estrogen on hepcidin expression. First,
ovariectomized (OVX) and sham-operated mice were employed to investigate the effects of estrogen on hepcidin
expression in an in vivo study. Hepcidin expression was decreased in the livers of OVX mice compared to the sham-operated
mice. In OVX mice, bone morphologic protein-6 (BMP6), a regulator of hepcidin, was also found to be downregulated in the
liver, whereas ferroportin (FPN), an iron export protein, was upregulated in the duodenum. Both serum and liver iron
concentrations were elevated in OVX mice relative to their concentrations in sham-operated mice. In in vitro studies, 17b￾estradiol (E2) increased the mRNA expression of hepcidin in HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. E2-induced
hepatic hepcidin upregulation was not inhibited by ICI 182720, an inhibitor of the estrogen receptor; instead, hepcidin
expression was increased by ICI 182720. E2 and ICI 182720 exhibit agonist actions with G-protein coupled receptor 30
(GPR30), the 7-transmembrane estrogen receptor. G1, a GPR30 agonist, upregulated hepcidin expression, and GPR30 siRNA
treatment abolished E2-induced hepcidin expression. BMP6 expression induced by E2 was abolished by GPR30 silencing.
Finally, both E2 and G1 supplementation restored reduced hepatic hepcidin and BMP6 expression and reversed the
augmentation of duodenal FPN expression in the OVX mice. In contrast, serum hepcidin was elevated in OVX mice, which
was reversed in these mice with E2 and G1. Thus, estrogen is involved in hepcidin expression via a GPR30-BMP6-dependent
mechanism, providing new insight into the role of estrogen in iron metabolism.

Introduction
Iron is an essential trace element that is necessary for all
living cells and organisms. Approximately 3–5 g of iron is stored
by healthy adults, and the amount of stored iron varies during
the lifetime. It is well known that gender differences exist with
respect to iron storage. Women exhibit low levels of iron
storage from adolescence to menopause. In perimenopausal
women, iron levels in the body increase to levels similar to those
in men of the same age [1]. Lower iron storage levels in women
is simply believed to be associated with blood loss during
menstruation, which explains the increase in iron storage by
women during perimenopause [2].
Menopause is detrimental for middle-aged and older women
because of various so-called menopausal disorders. Menopause
is generally considered to occur because of a deficiency in the
female sex steroid hormone estrogen. In women, estrogen levels
increase around adolescence and remain constant until peri￾menopause, when its levels decrease because of the cessation of
ovarian function in the postmenopausal period. In terms of the
relationship between iron and estrogen, it has been observed
that there is a coincidental and inverse correlation between
estrogen levels and iron storage during perimenopause [2].
Recently, several studies have demonstrated that estrogen exerts
various effects on multiple organs, including both classical target
organs and non-classical target organs [3]. We hypothesized
that the reduction of estrogen levels due to menopause is
responsible for increased iron accumulation due to changes in
iron regulation. However, the effects of estrogen on iron
regulation remain unknown.
Hepcidin is a secreted protein derived from hepatocytes, and it
has been identified as an important regulator of iron metabolism
[4]. Indeed, hepcidin has been demonstrated to regulate iron
absorption in the duodenum through internalization and degra￾dation of ferroportin (FPN), an exporter of iron [5]. In the present
study, we demonstrate a new effect of estrogen on iron
metabolism. Estrogen regulates hepcidin expression via G-coupled
protein 30 (GPR30)–bone morphologic protein 6 (BMP6)-depen￾dent signaling, indicating that estrogen actually decreases iron
absorption in the intestine.

Results
Effect of Estrogen on Hepcidin Expression and Iron
Absorption in vivo
To elucidate the effect of estrogen on iron metabolism in vivo, we
compared hepcidin and iron levels between OVX and sham￾operated mice. Both mRNA and protein expression of hepcidin
was significantly reduced in the livers of OVX mice as compared
to the expression in the livers of sham-operated mice. Further￾more, the mRNA and protein levels of BMP6, an upstream
regulator of hepcidin [6,7], were also decreased in the OVX mice
as compared to those in the sham-operated mice (Figure 1A).
Hepcidin is regulated by various factors, including inflammation
and cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) [8]. We examined IL-6
expression in the liver. There were no differences in hepatic IL-6
expression between the sham-operated and OVX mice (data not
shown).
Next, we evaluated the expression of FPN in the duodenum. As
shown in Figure 1B, the protein level of duodenal FPN was
significantly increased at 3 months after ovariectomy in the OVX
mice. Similarly, immunohistochemical analysis showed increased
FPN expression in the duodenum of OVX mice as compared to
that in the duodenum of sham-operated mice (Figures 1C);
moreover, changes in FPN localization were observed. In sham￾operated mice, duodenal FPN expression was mostly localized
around the nuclei in basement villous enterocytes, meanwhile,
FPN expression in OVX mice was diffuse in cytoplasmic villous
enterocytes (Figure 1D). Serum and liver iron levels were
significantly elevated in the OVX mice as compared to those in
the sham-operated mice (Figure 1E).
Effect of Estrogen on Hepcidin Expression in HepG2 and
HuH-7 Cells
For further clarification, we examined the effects of estrogen on
hepcidin expression in vitro using HepG2 cells. As shown in
Figure 2A, E2 upregulated hepcidin mRNA expression in a
concentration-dependent manner. The ER inhibitor ICI 182780
was used to determine whether the effects of estrogen on hepcidin
were mediated by an ER-dependent pathway. Interestingly, ICI
182780 co-treatment increased hepcidin expression in both
HepG2 (Figure 2B) and HuH-7 cells (Figure 2C).
E2 Induced Hepcidin Expression via GRP30-BMP6-
mediated Signaling
GPR30 has been identified as a membrane receptor for estrogen
[9], and several studies have shown that ICI 182780 exerts its
effects as an agonist of GPR30 [10]. To determine whether E2
augments hepcidin expression through a GPR30-dependent
pathway, we performed silencing experiments using siRNA against
GPR30. The mRNA levels of GPR30 were decreased by 68%
after treatment with GPR30 siRNA as compared to the levels in
the control siRNA-treated cells (Figure 3A). GPR30 silencing
suppressed E2-induced hepcidin expression almost entirely
(Figure 3B). Similarly, silencing of GPR30 suppressed ICI
182780-induced hepcidin expression (Figure 3C). Moreover, the
GPR30 agonist G1 stimulated hepcidin expression in a concen￾tration-dependent manner (Figure 3D). Similar to hepcidin, BMP6
expression was stimulated by E2, ICI 182780, and G1 (Figure 4A).
Moreover, E2-induced BMP6 upregulation was inhibited by
GPR30 silencing in HepG2 cells (Figure 4B). To assess whether
E2 induced hepcidin expression through BMP6 signaling, we used
siRNA against BMP6. BMP6 expression was decreased by 78%
after siRNA transfection (Figure 4C left). Silencing of BMP6 itself
markedly decreased hepcidin expression, and E2-induced hepcidin
upregulation was abolished by BMP6 silencing in HepG2 cells
(Figure 4C right).
Effect of E2 or G1 Supplementation on the Repression of
Hepcidin and BMP Expression in the Liver and
Augmentation of FPN Expression in the Duodenum of
OVX Mice
We investigated whether reduced hepcidin expression in the
OVX mice was restored by E2 or G1 supplementation.
Administration of either E2 or G1 recovered hepcidin and
BMP6 expression in the livers of OVX mice (Figure 5). Moreover,
the increased FPN protein expression in the duodena of the OVX
mice was diminished by E2 or G1 treatment (Figure 6A), which
was confirmed immunohistochemically (Figure 6B). The expres￾sion pattern of FPN in the villous enterocytes of the OVX mice
was changed from diffuse to localized by E2 or G1 administration
(left side of Figure 6B). Serum and liver iron concentrations were
increased in the OVX mice, which was restored in the OVX mice
with E2 and G1 administration (Figure 6C and D). In contrast to
liver hepcidin expression, serum hepcidin levels were elevated in
the OVX mice compared to the sham-operated mice, while the
OVX-induced serum hepcidin increase was reduced by E2 or G1
treatment (Figure 6E).
Discussion
In the present study, we found that hepatic hepcidin expression
was downregulated in OVX mice. Consequently, duodenal FPN
expression was upregulated. Estrogen played a role in hepcidin
expression in a GPR30-BMP6-dependent manner in vitro. These
findings indicate that estrogen is involved in iron metabolism
through the regulation of hepcidin.
Hepcidin, an antimicrobial peptide, is mainly produced and
secreted by hepatocytes [11,12]. FPN, an iron exporter, also plays
a pivotal role in intestinal iron absorption [13]. Recently, hepcidin
was demonstrated to play a crucial role in iron metabolism by
regulating iron absorption in the duodenum via FPN [5]. Indeed,
hepcidin-deficient mice showed massive iron overload [14] and
increased FPN expression in the duodenum [15]. Thus, the
coordinated regulation of hepcidin and FPN is directly linked to
duodenal iron absorption. In the present study, OVX mice
showed decreased expression of hepatic hepcidin as compared to
its expression in sham-operated mice, and E2 stimulated hepcidin
expression in cultured hepatocytes. These data suggest that
estrogen directly participates in the regulation of hepatic hepcidin
expression. Indeed, the expression levels of FPN in the duodenum
were also augmented in the OVX mice with reduced hepcidin
expression, suggesting that accelerated iron absorption and
consequent increased iron storage occur in the estrogen-deficient
state. In fact, OVX mice showed augmented iron storage in the
present study. Estrogen participates in iron metabolism via
hepcidin and FPN, which is a new explanation for the increase
in iron storage in women during menopause.
Hepcidin expression is regulated by various factors, and BMP6
regulates iron metabolism via hepatic hepcidin [6,7]. In the present
study, BMP6 expression was significantly decreased in the livers of
OVXmiceas comparedtothatinthelivers of sham-operatedmice. In
HepG2 cells, E2 treatment induced BMP6 expression in addition to
hepcidin expression. BMP6 silencing abolished hepcidin expression,
and E2 failed to upregulate hepcidin expression in HepG2 cells after
BMP6 silencing. Moreover, E2-induced hepcidin expression as well
as BMP6 expression was not suppressed by the ER antagonist ICI
182780. Unexpectedly, ICI 182780 augmented both hepcidin and

BMP6 expression. ICI 182780 has been demonstrated to have an
agonistic effect on GPR30, a membrane receptor for estrogen [9,10].
The GPR30 agonist G1 also upregulated the expression of hepcidin
andBMP6;conversely,GPR30 silencing suppressedbothE2-and ICI
182780-induced hepcidin and BMP6 expression. Finally, hepcidin
expression in the livers of OVX female mice was recovered by E2 and
G1 supplementation. These findings suggest that a GPR30-BMP6
pathway, not the classical ER-mediated signaling pathway, is
involved in the E2-induced expression of hepcidin in the liver.
We also measured serum hepcidin concentrations, which were
elevated in the OVX mice compared to sham-operated mice; the
increased serum hepcidin levels in the OVX mice were suppressed
compared to the levels in sham-operated mice by E2 or G1
administration. These results were unexpected and in contrast
with the findings of hepatic hepcidin expression. There are several
plausible explanations for these data. First, elevated serum
hepcidin levels may be a compensatory consequence of upregu￾lated FPN expression in the OVX mice. Berki and colleagues have
shown that obese patients or those with diabetes or nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis showed reduced hepatic hepcidin expression and
increased adipose hepcidin expression compared to lean controls
[16], which suggests that serum hepcidin is derived from not only
the liver but also from other tissues including adipose. Second,

serum and liver iron levels were elevated in this study. Some
studies have shown that hepatic hepcidin expression is reduced in
hepatitis C mice with elevated serum and liver iron content [17],
while serum hepcidin levels were increased in patients with
hepatitis C [18], which are similar to the results obtained in our
study. In addition, serum hepcidin levels correlated with serum
iron levels, but not with mRNA levels of hepcidin in the livers of
patients with hepatocellular cancer [19]. Thus, the relationship
between hepatic hepcidin expression and the serum hepcidin
concentration under some clinical conditions remains controver￾sial. Further studies are necessary to clarify this discrepancy
between hepatic hepcidin expression and serum hepcidin levels.
In the present study, we demonstrated that estrogen is
potentially involved in the regulation of iron absorption via the
coordination of hepatic hepcidin and duodenal FPN. However,
there is a gender discrepancy between humans and mice with
respect to iron metabolism and hepcidin regulation. Body iron
content is typically lower in women than in men, whereas several
studies on mice have shown that female mice have higher iron
content in the liver and spleen than male mice [20,21]. Females
menstruate monthly from adolescence until menopause in humans
but not in mice. Regarding the relationship between hepcidin and
gender-specific differences in iron storage, hepatic hepcidin
expression is higher in female mice than in male mice [20,21].
In contrast, recent clinical studies have shown that serum hepcidin

levels are lower in women than in men [22], and premenopausal
women have lower serum hepcidin concentrations than postmen￾opausal women [23,24]. Thus, it is difficult to apply our results
regarding the effects of estrogen on hepcidin expression to
humans.
Although the effects of the relationship between estrogen and
hepcidin on iron metabolism remains unclear, testosterone has
been demonstrated to participate in iron metabolism via hepcidin.
Testosterone administration decreases serum hepcidin concentra￾tions [25]. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, who have
decreased estrogen and increased testosterone levels, also show
reduced serum hepcidin levels [26]. In this study, we showed the
effects of estrogen on hepcidin expression. Therefore, further study
is necessary to determine the mechanisms of action of sex steroid
hormones in regulating hepcidin expression as well as iron
metabolism.

In conclusion, estrogen regulates iron absorption via hepcidin in
the liver. The effects of estrogen on hepcidin expression are
exerted through a GPR30-BMP6-dependent mechanism. Estro￾gen-deficient conditions after ovariectomy resulted in augmented
iron absorption in the duodenum because of the downregulation
of hepcidin in the liver and contributed to increased body iron
storage. Excess iron content is known to cause oxidative stress via
the Haber-Weiss reaction [27]. These findings regarding the
effects of estrogen on iron metabolism might explain the increase
in iron accumulation in estrogen-deficient conditions such as
menopausal disorders.

Animal Preparation and Ovariectomy
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance
with the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee of the
University of Tokushima Graduate School, and protocols were
approved by the Institutional Review Board for Animal protec￾tion. Six-week-old female C57/BL6J mice were purchased from
Nippon CLEA (Tokyo, Japan). The mice were maintained with
free access to water and food (Type NMF; Oriental Yeast, Tokyo,
Japan). The iron concentration of the food was 0.01%. Before the
experiments, mice were randomly divided into 2 groups:
ovariectomized (OVX) and sham-operated groups. The bilateral
ovariectomy procedure was performed as follows, In brief, the
mice were anesthetized by peritoneal injection of 20 mg?kg21
pentobarbital. Next, 2 lateral incisions were made in the skin and
the muscle layer. The ovaries were extracted through the incision
and excised after ligation. Tissue samples were collected 3 months
after the operation. In an additional experiment, OVX mice were
administered E2 or G1 via an osmotic mini-pump during the final
month. The concentration and the method of administering E2
(20 mg?kg21
?day21
) or G1 (0.1 mg?kg21
?day21
) were based on
previous studies [28,29].
Cell Culture
Human hepatoma HepG2 cells and HuH-7 cells were
commercially purchased from TAKARA BIO. INC. (Otsu, Japan)
and the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Osaka,
Japan), respectively. Cells were cultured in phenol red free￾DMEM (Life Technologies Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), according
to the culture protocol. For each experiment, cells at passages 5–8
were used. According to several studies, HepG2 cells exhibit
estrogen receptor (ER) expression [30]; however, the expression
levels of ERs in HepG2 cells are insufficient to activate classical
receptor-mediated effects [31]. Therefore, we examined ER
expression in HepG2 cells using quantitative reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); however, ER mRNA
expression was not detected in these cells (data not shown).
Therefore, we also used HuH-7 cells, another human hepatoma
cell line that has been shown to express ER in several experiments
[32]. Before use, E2 was dissolved in pure ethanol, and ICI 182720
and G1 were dissolved in DMSO. The final concentration of
ethanol and/or DMSO in the cell culture medium was less than
0.5%; moreover, the control groups were added at the same
concentration of ethanol and/or DMSO was added to the controls
as the vehicle in all experiments. In some experiments, cells were
pretreated with ICI 182780 for 1 h before stimulation with E2.
Cells were grown to confluence and then transferred to serum-free
medium before the start of the experiments.
RNA Extraction and Evaluation of mRNA Expression
Levels
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative RT-PCR
methods have been described previously [33,34]. In brief, tissues
or cells were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies
Japan Ltd.). RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (PrimeScriptH RT
reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time), TAKARA
BIO INC.). Next, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the
iCycler MyiQ2 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD
Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) with THUNDERBIRD SYBR
qPCR Mix (TOYOBO CO., LTD., Osaka, Japan). The following
primer sets were used: 59-GACCAGTGGCTCTGTTTTCC-39
and 59-AAAATGCAGATGGGGAAGTG-39 for human hepcidin
(Hamp); 59-AGCATAACATGGGGCTTCAG-39 and 59-
CACGTGCACCTCACTCACTT-39 for human BMP6; 59-
AGGGACAAGCTGAGGCTGTA-39 and 59- GCTGAACCT￾CACATCCGACT-39 for human GPR30; 59-
CTGCCTGTCTCCTGCTTCTC-39 and 59-AGATGCA￾GATGGGGAAGTTG-39 for mouse hepcidin (Hamp1); 59-
GAAGGTTGGCTGGAATTTGA-39 and 59- AC￾CTCGCTCACCTTGAAGAA-39 for mouse BMP6; and 59-
GCTCCAAGCAGATGCAGCA-39 and 59-CCGGATGT￾GAGGCAGCAG-39 for 36B4 as an internal control [33].
Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Experiments
siRNAs targeting human GPR30 and BMP6 and a non￾targeting siRNA control sequence were purchased from Sigma￾Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan), and transfection was performed as
previously reported [33]. Briefly, subconfluent HepG2 cells were
transfected for 24 h with 40 nM of each siRNA by using
LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX in Opti-MEM medium (Life
Technologies Japan Ltd.) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Next, the conditioned medium was replaced with
fresh serum-free DMEM, after which the cells were incubated for
24 h. For all the experiments, transfected HepG2 cells were used
48 h after transfection. The siRNA sequences were as follows:
sense strand 59-CUGACACCGUCGACCAGGATT-39 and anti￾sense strand 59-UCCUGGUCGACGGUGUCGTT-39 for
GPR30 siRNA; sense strand 59-CAGAAUUCCGCAUCUA￾CAATT-39 and antisense strand 59-UUGUAGAUGCGGAAUU￾CUGTT-39 for BMP6 siRNA.
Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis
Three months after ovariectomy, the liver and duodenum were
removed and stored at 280uC until use. Hepatoma cells were
washed with PBS, scraped, and stored at 280uC until further use.
Protein preparation and western blotting were performed as
previously described [34]. In brief, tissues or cells were homog￾enized, and proteins were extracted. Extracted proteins were
boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and then separated
using SDS-PAGE. Once the proteins were transferred to a
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, the membrane was
blocked for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the membrane was
incubated individually with each primary antibody overnight at
4uC, followed by incubation for 1 h with the respective secondary
antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using a chemilu￾minescence reagent. Densitometry of the visualized bands was
quantified using Image J 1.386software.
Immunohistochemistry
Duodenum samples extracted from mice were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4uC overnight and then embedded in
paraffin. Samples were cut into 2-mm sections and deparaffinized.
After antigen retrieval with 10 mM citrate buffer at 95uC for
10 min, sections were incubated in primary antibody at 4uC
overnight. Staining was visualized by a linked streptavidin-biotin
complex assay and a DAB substrate kit (LSAB+ Kit Universal;
Dako Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The negative control was incubated
without the primary antibody.
Measurement of Tissue and Serum Iron Concentration
Tissue iron concentration and serum iron levels were measured
using an iron assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Metallo assay, AKJ Global Technology Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan).
In brief, the extracted liver tissues were weighted and homoge￾nized in cell lysis buffer. The crude lysates were further dissolved
using an ultrasonic sonicator. Hydrochloric acid (6 N) was added

to the samples at a final concentration of 0.05 M; samples were
then mixed well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
Following centrifugation, the supernatants were used for mea￾surements. Tissue iron concentration was corrected using the
tissue weight and is expressed as ng?g21 tissue.
Measurement of Serum Hepcidin Levels
Serum mouse hepcidin-1 concentrations were quantitatively
analyzed by SELDI-TOF mass-spectrometry as described previ￾ously [35]. The assay was performed by Medical Care Proteomics
Biotechnology Co.,Ltd. (Kanazawa, Japan).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean 6 standard error of mean (SEM).
An unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t-test was used for comparison
between 2 groups. For comparisons between more than 2 groups,
the statistical significance of each difference was evaluated by post￾hoc test using Dunnett’s method or Tukey-Kramer’s method.
Statistical significance was indicated by P,0.05.
