Abstract Introduction
Previous studies have suggested that EGF or other members
of the EGF family of mitogenic proteins are involved in
proliferation of renal tubular epithelial cells occurring dur￾ing recovery from injury to the kidney. The present studies
examined whether expression of mRNA for the recently
identified heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB￾EGF) is regulated in response to renal injury induced by
either ischemia/reperfusion or mercuric chloride. Increased
expression of HB-EGF mRNA was demonstrated in the
post-ischemic kidney within 45 min of unilateral ischemia/
reperfusion in the rat. Induction of HB-EGF mRNA oc￾curred only when ischemia was followed by reperfusion,
and was not eliminated by removal of blood cells from the
post-ischemic kidney by saline perfusion. In situ hybridiza￾tion with 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes of HB-EGF indi￾cated that compared with control, there was increased HB￾EGF mRNA expression in the 6 h post-ischemic kidney in
the inner cortex and outer medulla in a patchy distribution,
with the greatest expression in the inner stripe of the outer
medulla. Expression occurred primarily in tubular epithe￾lial cells. Recombinant human HB-EGF stimulated [3H] -
thymidine incorporation in both primary cultures of rabbit
proximal tubule cells and NRK 52E normal rat kidney epi￾thelial cells, with potency similar to that of EGF. Induction
of HB-EGF mRNA was observed in tubules freshly isolated
from rat renal cortex or outer medulla when the tubules
were subjected to reoxygenation after incubation in anoxic
conditions. The nephrotoxin, mercuric chloride, also caused
induction of HB-EGF mRNA both in vivo and in isolated
rat cortical tubules. The anoxia/reoxygenation-induced ex￾pression of HB-EGF mRNA in isolated tubules was inhibited
by the free radical scavengers, di- and tetra-methylthiourea,
indicating involvement of reactive oxygen species. These
findings indicate that HB-EGF mRNA is inducible in the
kidney in vivo by acute tubular injury and suggest that
HB-EGF may act as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor
involved in proliferation of tubular epithelial cells and re￾pair of the kidney. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 96:1018-1025.)

The mammalian kidney is susceptible to injury by ischemia/
reperfusion and nephrotoxins, and subsequent restoration of re￾nal architecture and function is characterized by proliferation
of tubular epithelial cells and recovery of the damaged epithelial
lining of the tubules (1). Accumulating evidence suggests that
either EGF, or other members of the EGF family of mitogenic
proteins, may play an important role in repair of the injured
kidney (2).
In the rat, subcutaneous injection of EGF significantly accel￾erates both [3H]thymidine incorporation in tubular epithelial
cells and recovery of tubular functions occurring in response to
ischemia/reperfusion injury or nephrotoxic injury to the kidney
(3-5). Continuous infusion of EGF by intra-aortic osmotic
minipump has also been shown to augment recovery of tubular
functions in the post-ischemic rat kidney (6). Ischemia/reperfu￾sion injury to the kidney is followed by increases in 251I-EGF
binding, with the greatest relative increases seen in the cortex
and the proximal tubule (7). This increased EGF binding is
detectable in the post-ischemic kidney by 24 h of reperfusion,
whereas no changes are noted in the contralateral, non-ischemic
kidney (6, 7). Similar increases in '25I-EGF binding have been
observed in rat kidney subjected to folic acid-induced injury
(8). EGF production in the mammalian kidney has been local￾ized to the thick ascending limb of Henle and distal convoluted
tubule (9). However, both ischemia/reperfusion injury and cis￾platin renal toxicity lead to decreases in renal preproEGF
mRNA levels and in urinary EGF excretion, with persistent
inhibition for up to 7 d (10).
Several peptide growth factors have been shown to share
structural homology with EGF and signal through EGF recep￾tors. Mammalian members of this EGF family of mitogenic
proteins include TGF-a (11), amphiregulin (12), and betacel￾lulin (13). Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB￾EGF)', a 22-kD protein that was originally purified from condi￾tioned media of a macrophage-like cell line, U-937 cells (14,
15), is a recently discovered member of the EGF family. HB￾EGF has been shown to be a potent mitogen for vascular smooth
muscle cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts, but not for endothe￾lial cells (14).
In the present studies, we examined whether expression of
HB-EGF mRNA is associated with acute renal injury. The re￾sults show that both in vivo and in vitro, HB-EGF mRNA
expression is induced in tubular epithelial cells in response to
acute injury and suggest a role for HB-EGF as an autocrine
and/or paracrine growth factor involved in renal regeneration.

Methods
Animal studies. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 150-200 grams,
were used. Unilateral renal ischemia was induced by surgical clamping
of the left renal artery for 50 min as previously described (16). In
successful experiments, the kidney turned uniformly dark within 2-3
min, and normal color returned within 2-4 min after removal of the
clamp, indicating reperfusion (16). At time intervals, rats were sacri￾ficed and kidneys removed for total RNA extraction. Unless otherwise
indicated, the nonclamped, contralateral kidney was used for the appro￾priate time control. Retrograde aortic perfusion with phosphate buffered
saline was performed to remove blood from the kidney. In separate
experiments, renal tubular injury was induced by a subcutaneous admin￾istration of mercuric chloride (5 mg/kg body wt) 5 h before time of
killing (4).
Preparation ofrat renal cortical and outer medullary tubule suspen￾sions. Cortical tubule suspension was prepared from rat renal cortices
by the methods of Vinay et al. (17), with slight modifications, as we
have previously described (18). Tubules were suspended in Buffer A
consisting of 115 mM NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KC1, 1.5 mM
CaC12, 10 mM MgSO4, 2.0 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM glucose, 1 mM
alanine, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. Medullary tubules were prepared in
Buffer A from outer medulla of rat kidneys as described by Chamberlin
et al. ( 19), except that separation of the thick ascending limb by density
gradient centrifugation was not performed.
Isolated rat tubules were subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation as
described by Yu et al. (20). Isolated rat tubules were incubated for 30
min at 37°C in Buffer A pre-equilibrated in 95% N2/5% CO2. Reoxygena￾tion was induced by transferring the centrifuged tubules to Buffer A pre￾equilibrated in 95% 02/5% CO2 and incubating at 37°C for an additional
30 or 60 min, with continued superfusion with 95% 02/5% CO2.
Cell culture. Primary cultures of rabbit proximal tubule cells were
prepared and grown in serum-free defined medium consisting of DME/
F12 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 jig/ml
streptomycin, 5 j.g/ml insulin, 5 /.g/ml transferrin, 10 nM selenium,
and 50 nM hydrocortisone as we have previously described (21).
NRK 52E cells, an epithelial cell line derived from normal rat kidney
(22), were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml streptomycin as pre￾viously described (22, 23).
Determination of[3Hjthymidine incorporation. Cells were cultured
in 24-well plates until confluency and incubated in DME/F12 medium
free of defined additions (rabbit proximal tubule cells) or in serum-free
DMEM medium (NRK 52E cells) for 48 h before addition of agonists.
After 18 h of incubation with agonists, 1 jiCi/ml [3H]thymidine was
added and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. Cells were
washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated
with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. Acid-precipitable mate￾rials were dissolved in 0.25 M NaOH/0.1% SDS and counted by scintil￾lation spectrometry.
RNA isolation and Northern analysis. Total RNA was isolated by
the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (24) and
subjected to Northern blot analysis as we have previously described
(25). Aliquots of total RNA, each consisting of 15 jsg, were subjected
to electrophoresis, transferred to S&S Nytran nylon membranes
(Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH), and fixed to the membrane by
exposing to UV. Following prehybridization, blots were hybridized with
2 x 106 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled cDNA overnight at 42°C. A cDNA probe
representing a 1.5-kb fragment of rat HB-EGF (26) was labeled to
> 10' cpm/i/g by random priming procedure using a commercially
available kit (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). The membranes were
washed and exposed at -700C to Kodak X-Omat AR film with an
intensifying screen. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a human
GAPDH cDNA using the conditions of labeling, hybridization, and
wash as described above. The levels of mRNA were quantitated by
densitometry (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA) and normalized to
GAPDH expression.
In situ hybridization. Procedures were essentially as described by
Gaunt et al. (27). Kidneys were perfusion-fixed in situ with 1% para￾formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and immersed in 4% para￾formaldehyde. After graded alcohol dehydration, tissues were embedded
in paraffin. Serial 7-,um sections were prepared on poly-L-lysine-coated
slide glasses and were permeabilized in 0.2 M HCl, followed by treat￾ment with 1 Ig/ml proteinase K at 370C for 15 min, refixed in 4%
formaldehyde and treated with 0.1 M triethanolamine in 0.25% (vol/
vol) acetic anhydride. A 1.5-kb fragment of rat HB-EGF ligated in
pBSK(-) was linearized and 35S-labeled, sense and anti-sense ribo￾probes were synthesized with T3 and T7 polymerase in the presence of
[35S]UTP and hydrolyzed to 300 base fragments. After pre-hybridiza￾tion, samples were hybridized at 450C overnight in 50% formamide, 0.3
M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, lx
Denhardt's solution, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 10% dextran sulfate.
Samples were successively washed in 2x SSC, washing buffer con￾sisting of 50% formamide, 0.3 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
10 mM DTT, and 0.2X Denhardt's solution, and finally in 0.1 X SSC.
The final wash also included post-hybridization treatment with RNase
A and RNase T1. The slide glasses were then dipped into emulsion of
two-fold dilution of Kodak NTB2, exposed for 2 wk at 4°C, developed
with Kodak DEKTOL, and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Materials. [a-32P]dCTP, [a-35S]UTP and [3H]thymidine were
purchased from Du Pont-New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). EGF
(receptor grade) was from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). Re￾combinant human HB-EGF was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN). The cDNAs for rat HB-EGF and human GAPDH, and NRK 52E
cells were provided by Dr. Judith Abraham of Scios Nova, Inc., Dr.
Naomasa Makita and Dr. Michael A. Haralson (Vanderbilt University),
respectively. All other chemicalsswere from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO).
Results
Induction ofHB-EGF mRNA in rat kidney by ischemia/reperfu￾sion and mercuric chloride. We first examined expression of
HB-EGF mRNA in kidneys subjected to ischemia/reperfusion
injury. In the rat, unilateral renal ischemia was induced by
clamping the renal artery for 50 min. The clamp was then re￾leased and, at various times of reperfusion, kidneys were re￾moved for extraction of total RNA, and levels of HB-EGF
mRNA were examined by northern blot analysis (Fig. 1, left
panels). In the post-ischemic kidney, a significant increase in
HB-EGF mRNA levels was observed within 1 h of reperfusion.
Expression of HB-EGF mRNA remained elevated at 6 h of
reperfusion (8.0+2.0-fold of that in the contralateral kidney; n
= 5; P < 0.05) and in some experiments was still elevated at
24 and 48 h.
Acute injury and subsequent regeneration of tubular epithe￾lial cells are also induced by a variety of nephrotoxins, including
mercuric chloride (1, 4). Mercuric chloride administration in￾duced expression of HB-EGF mRNA in the kidney within 5 h
(Fig. 1, right panels).
Expression of HB-EGF mRNA occurring in the post-isch￾emic kidney was localized by in situ hybridization using 35S￾labeled antisense riboprobes prepared from rat HB-EGF cDNA
(Fig. 2). A low power dark-field photomicrograph of the 6
h post-ischemic kidney (Fig. 2 A) indicated the presence of
hybridization with an anti-sense cRNA probe to rat HB-EGF
in the medulla and cortex in a patchy distribution, with the most
intense hybridization signals in the inner stripe of the outer
medulla and patchier signals in the outer medulla and cortex.
Therewas no detectable hybridization in the inner medulla (Fig.
2, A-2). In the contralateral non-ischemic kidney, anti-sense
probes did not detect significant hybridization in the inner stripe
of the outer medulla (Fig. 2 B). The specificity of the hybridiza￾tion signals was confirmed by the lack of any hybridization in

Figure 1. Induction of HB-EGF mRNA in rat kidney in vivo after acute
injury by ischemia/reperfusion or mercuric chloride. (Left panels) Rats
were subjected to unilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and, at
the indicated times of reperfusion, both ischemic (Ischemic) and non￾ischemic, contralateral (Contra) kidneys were removed and total RNA
was extracted as described in Methods. Aliquots of total RNA ( 15 j4g)
were subjected to Northern analysis for HB-EGF mRNA expression as
described in Methods. (Right panels) In separate experiments, mercuric
chloride was administered to rats. At 5 h, kidneys were removed, and

the post-ischemic kidney using sense probes (Fig. 2 C). Higher
power photomicrographs of the inner stripe of the outer medulla
(Fig. 2, D and E) showed that expression of HB-EGF mRNA
in the post-ischemic kidney was detected primarily in tubular
epithelial cells, predominantly collecting tubules, with occa￾sional expression in thick ascending limbs. In the outer stripe
of the outer medulla (Fig. 2, F and G), intense hybridization
was also detected in collecting tubules (Fig. 2 F, arrow). In
addition, there was patchy hybridization noted in medullary
thick ascending limbs (Fig. 2 G, arrow), with minimal hybrid￾ization in proximal straight tubules (Fig. 2 G, arrowhead).
Since necrosis and subsequent regeneration of tubular epi￾thelial cells in the post-ischemic kidney is most prominent in
proximal tubules, the localization of HB-EGF mRNA expres￾sion to distal tubular structure suggested that endogenous HB￾EGF might serve as a paracrine growth factor involved in prolif￾eration of proximal tubule cells. To determine whether proximal
tubules respond to HB-EGF, we examined mitogenic activity
of recombinant human HB-EGF in primary cultures of rabbit
proximal tubule cells (Fig. 3 A). Incubation of cells with either
EGF or recombinant HB-EGF stimulated incorporation of [3H] -
thymidine in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). In
rabbit proximal tubule cells, maximal 3.8- and 4.0-fold stimula￾tion was observed at 3.3 and 1.7 nM of EGF and recombinant
HB-EGF, respectively. EC50 was seen at 0.3 nM and 0.6 nM
for EGF and recombinant HB-EGF, respectively (Fig. 3 A).
We performed similar studies in a rat renal epithelial cell line,
NRK 52E (Fig. 3 B). In these cells, EGF and recombinant HB￾EGF caused maximal 5.0- and 5.5-fold stimulation of [3H]-
thymidine incorporation at 3.3 and 1.7 nM, respectively. EC50
was observed at 0.3 nM and 0.8 nM for EGF and recombinant
HB-EGF, respectively.
Previous studies have suggested an important role for reper￾fusion in initiation of the full range of responses following
ischemic injury (1). Therefore, we examined whether induction
of HB-EGF mRNA in the post-ischemic kidney was dependent
on subsequent reperfusion. In the experiments shown in Fig. 4
A, kidneys were subjected to either 45 or 90 min of ischemia
without reperfusion, or to 45 min of ischemia with subsequent
reperfusion for 45 min. Ischemia alone did not affect HB-EGF
mRNA levels. In contrast, when the kidneys were reperfused,
the level of HB-EGF mRNA was significantly increased (Fig.
4 A). These findings indicated that ischemia and subsequent
reperfusion, rather than ischemia alone, was required for full
induction of HB-EGF mRNA in vivo.
We also examined whether stasis of hematopoietic cells in
the post-ischemic kidney was contributing to the increased HB￾EGF mRNA levels (Fig. 4 B). Three hours after the release
of the renal artery clamp, both contralateral and post-ischemic
kidneys were flushed in situ with phosphate buffered saline
prior to extraction of total RNA (Fig. 4 B). Saline perfusion
did not alter the increased HB-EGF mRNA expression seen in
the post-ischemic kidney. These observations confirmed the in
situ findings that the observed induction of HB-EGF mRNA
occurred in either intrinsic renal cells or infiltrating inflamma￾tory cells.
Induction ofHB-EGF mRNA in rat renal cortical and outer
medullary tubule suspension in vitro. The in vivo studies dem￾onstrated that renal injury by ischemia/reperfusion resulted in
increased HB-EGF mRNA expression in the damaged kidney
in both cortex and outer medulla. To examine further the induc￾ibility of HB-EGF mRNA in tubules under the conditions simi￾lar to that of the in vivo studies, but in the absence of either
infiltrating inflammatory cells or intrinsic nontubular renal cells,
we used tubules freshly isolated from either renal cortex or
outer medulla of the rat. Cortical tubules were isolated from
control rat kidneys and incubated for 30 min under anoxic con￾ditions, with or without subsequent reoxygenation for an addi￾tional 60 min (Fig. 5 A). Whereas the level of HB-EGF mRNA
was significantly increased in the tubules subjected to anoxic
conditions, full induction was observed following reoxygena￾tion. Incubation of the tubules for 90 min with mercuric chloride
also resulted in induction of HB-EGF mRNA (Fig. 5 A). Low
levels of HB-EGF mRNA were also observed in freshly isolated
medullary tubules (Fig. 5 B). Similar to the findings in cortical
tubules, HB-EGF mRNA expression in the outer medullary tu￾bule suspensions was increased following incubation under an￾oxic conditions and markedly augmented upon reoxygenation
(Fig. 5 B).
Since reactive oxygen species have been suggested to medi￾ate functional and structural alterations that occur in response
to ischemic injury (1, 28), we examined effects of free radical
scavengers, di- and tetra-methylthiourea (29) on expression of
HB-EGF mRNA induced by anoxia/reoxygenation in isolated
rat renal tubules (Fig. 6). The level of HB-EGF mRNA in
freshly isolated cortical tubules remained very low upon 90 min
of incubation under control conditions. Incubation under anoxic
condition for 30 min increased expression of HB-EGF mRNA
and subsequent reoxygenation resulted in a further increase in
HB-EGF mRNA expression. When reoxygenation was per￾formed in the presence of either dimethylthiourea or tetrameth￾ylthiourea, induction of HB-EGF mRNA was significantly in￾hibited (Fig. 6 A). In similar experiments performed on freshly
isolated rat outer medullary tubules, the anoxia/reoxygenation￾induced increases in HB-EGF mRNA expression were reduced
in the presence of these free radical scavengers (Fig. 6 B). In

against this hypothesis is the observation that expression of
preproEGF mRNA is significantly decreased following acute
boo #
renal injury by ischemia/reperfusion (7) or cis-platin-induced
nephrotoxicity (10). This decrease in renal EGF production led
us to examine whether other mitogenic proteins of the EGF
family might be involved in regeneration of the kidney. In the

it was demonstrated that HB-EGF mRNA was inducible in rat

ischemic injury, the observed intense HB-EGF mRNA expres￾sion in tubular epithelial cells in this region suggests that media￾tors of ischemic injury and subsequent regeneration of tubular
epithelial cells are closely linked with induction of HB-EGF
mRNA. The distribution of HB-EGF mRNA expression in the
post-ischemic kidney is in contrast to that of hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF). Expression of HGF mRNA occurring in the
post-ischemic kidney is localized to interstitial cells, including
endothelial cells and macrophages, but not in tubular epithelial
cells (36). These findings suggest that induction of HB-EGF
may be more closely associated with damage to tubular epithe￾lium than that of HGF.
We demonstrated that recombinant HB-EGF was mitogenic
for both primary cultures of rabbit proximal tubule cells and
NRK 52E normal rat kidney epithelial cells (Fig. 3). Combined
with the observations that the most intense expression of HB￾EGF mRNA was localized to tubular epithelial cells in the
outer medulla, the observed mitogenic activity of HB-EGF for
cultured proximal tubule cells indicates that endogenous HB￾EGF may serve as a paracrine growth factor for the proximal
tubule. While the nephron segment origin of NRK 52E normal
rat kidney epithelial cells has not been fully characterized, these
cells have recently been shown to express functionally active
mineralcorticoid receptors characteristic of distal tubules (40,
41). Thus, the present results suggest that HB-EGF may also
be involved in repair or regeneration of distal tubules in an
autocrine fashion. In this regard, recent reports have indicated
that apoptosis of distal tubular epithelial cells occurred after
ischemia (42) or aminoglycoside injury (43), two renal insults
known to induce proximal tubule necrotic injury. Since EGF
administration has been shown to decrease apoptosis in both
mesenchimally derived and ureteric-bud derived cells during
development (44), it can be speculated that local production
of HB-EGF in distal nephron may serve an autocrine and/or
paracrine function to limit apoptosis in these segments.
We found that reperfusion of the ischemic kidney was nec￾essary for full induction of HB-EGF mRNA in vivo (Fig. 4 A).
Similarly, reoxygenation of isolated rat renal cortical or outer
medullary tubules was required for full induction of HB-EGF
mRNA after incubation under anoxic conditions (Fig. 5). In
these experiments, it is possible that the increased expression
of HB-EGF mRNA seen after anoxia/reoxygenation may have
been a reflection of the time required for the cellular machinery
to achieve induction of the HB-EGF gene. Alternatively, induc￾tion of HB-EGF mRNA may have occurred as a result of reacti￾vation of metabolic pathways that are only operative when cells
are oxygenated. However, other studies have suggested that
whereas ischemia per se causes certain functional and morpho￾logic alterations in the kidney, the full spectrum of ischemic
renal injury occurs upon reperfusion, as a result of free radical
production (1). In vivo studies have shown that loss of renal
function seen after ischemic or glycerol-induced injury is amel￾iorated by either hydroxyl radical scavengers or inhibition of
hydroxy radical production by iron chelators (28, 45).
In the present studies, the free radical scavengers, dimethyl￾thiourea and tetramethylurea reduced induction of HB-EGF
mRNA occurring in response to anoxia/reoxygenation in
freshly isolated rat cortical and outer medullary tubules (Fig.
6). The anoxia/reoxygenation-induced expression of HB-EGF
mRNA was more sensitive to oxygen radical scavengers in
isolated cortical tubules than in outer medullary tubules (Fig.
6), suggesting that involvement of reactive oxygen species may
vary between these tubule preparations. Recently, it has been
proposed that oxygen radicals may function as second messen￾gers for gene activation, in particular for genes under the regula￾tion of the transcription factor NF-KB (46-48). It is possible
that the observed induction of HB-EGF mRNA occurs through
similar pathways.
In vascular smooth muscle cells (32) and mesangial cells
(49), HB-EGF has been shown to behave as an "immediate
early gene," with agonist-induced increases in mRNA oc￾curring in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Thus,
the induction of HB-EGF mRNA observed in the post-ischemic
kidney is in close agreement with the previous observations that
induction of protooncogenes, Egf-J and c-fos, occurs upon
reperfusion after ischemia (50). It is plausible that induction
of HB-EGF is one of the immediate responses to renal injury,
initiating repair or regeneration of damaged epithelial cells by
autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms. Furthermore, since
EGF receptor expression is known to be increased by activation
of the EGF receptor (51, 52), increased HB-EGF expression
in the post-ischemic kidney may mediate the increase in EGF
receptor density seen within 24 h of ischemic insult (7).
In summary, we have demonstrated that renal injury by
either ischemia/reperfusion or mercuric chloride resulted in in￾duction of HB-EGF mRNA both in vivo and in vitro. Induction
of HB-EGF mRNA in the post-ischemic kidney was localized
primarily to tubular epithelial cells in the inner cortex and outer
medulla. We also demonstrated that recombinant HB-EGF was
mitogenic for primary cultures of rabbit proximal tubule cells
and NRK 52E normal rat kidney epithelial cells. By using tu￾bules freshly isolated from either rat renal cortex or outer me￾dulla, we showed that HB-EGF mRNA was inducible in renal
tubular epithelial cells. Finally, we provided evidence that reac￾tive oxygen species were involved in induction of HB-EGF
mRNA that occurred in isolated renal tubules in response to
anoxia/reoxygenation. In addition to the recent demonstration
of HB-EGF proteins in wound fluid of skin (31), the present
findings represent a pathophysiological setting in which HB￾EGF may play a significant role in the regenerative growth of
the organ.
