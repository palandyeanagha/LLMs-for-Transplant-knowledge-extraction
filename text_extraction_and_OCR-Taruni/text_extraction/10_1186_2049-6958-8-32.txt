Abstract
Background: Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a pathologic condition in which softening of tracheal and bronchial
cartilage causes the dynamic narrowing of transverse or sagittal diameters of tracheobronchial lumen; an excessive
dynamic airway collapse (EDAC) may also be associated, with a substantial invagination of the posterior membrane
of trachebronchial tree.
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of both TBM and EDAC in a population of asthmatics with
different degrees of disease severity compared to a reference group of subjects without any bronchial obstruction.
Methods: A cohort of 202 asthmatics was investigated by means of a dynamic flexible videobronchoscopy: 74 mild
persistent (MPA - age 18–68 ys; 35 males; mean FEV1 = 88.6% pred. ± 8.3 sd); 63 moderate (MA - age 21–71 ys; 30
males; mean FEV1 = 71.3% pred. ± 9.1 sd), 65 severe asthmatics (SA - age 33–70 ys; 25 males; mean FEV1 = 48.5%
pred. ± 7.6 sd), and 62 non obstructed subjects (NO - age 18–71 ys; 38 males; mean FEV1 98.6% pred. ± 2.7 sd).
TBM and EDAC were classified according to FEMOS classification.
Results: TBM and EDAC were observed in only 1/62 subjects (both 1.61%) of NO group, while their prevalence was
2.70% and 6.75% in MPA group; 7.93% and 19.04% in MA group; 18.46% and 69.23% in SA group, respectively. The
crude prevalence of thyroid disorders in the population was 12.9%. In particular, the prevalence of thyroid disorders
was significantly higher in females than in men, but 54-fold higher in females than in men in the presence of
EDAC.
Conclusions: 1) The prevalence of both TBM and EDAC is directly related to age, gender (females), and asthma
severity; 2) EDAC is much more frequent than TBM in all asthma patients; 3) both tracheal abnormalities proved to
be more represented in asthmatics with thyroid disorders, and particularly in female asthmatics with EDAC.

Background
Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a pathologic condition
in which softening of tracheal and bronchial cartilage
causes the dynamic narrowing of transverse or sagittal
diameters of tracheobronchial lumen. This condition
may or may not be associated with a substantial invagin￾ation of the posterior membrane of trachebronchial tree,
an entity referred to an excessive dynamic airway col￾lapse (EDAC), which is peculiar in some patients with
obstructive pulmonary disease, such as chronic bron￾chitis, emphysema, asthma, or can represent an isolated
finding in patients during cough or forced expiration.
Tracheomalacia refers to a weakness of the trachea
frequently due to a reduction and/or atrophy of the lon￾gitudinal elastic fibers of the pars membranacea or im￾paired cartilage integrity, such that the airway is softer
and more susceptible to collapse [1,2]. This disease may
arise congenitally (from disorders associated with im￾paired cartilage maturation or in combination with other
abnormalities like tracheoesopageal fistula) or it may be
acquired from prior intubation, trauma, infections, long
standing extrinsic compression, or chronic inflammation

[3,4]. Localized TBM is usually seen in patients with
prolonged endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, or
vascular rings. The cause of diffuse TBM is often un￾known, but it is frequently seen in patients with com￾mon respiratory conditions, such as chronic bronchitis.
Acquired TBM has been reported to be present in
4.5% of bronchoscopies in large general series [2]; in
12.7% of all patients undergoing bronchoscopy evalu￾ation for respiratory disease [3], and in as many as 44%
of patients undergoing bronchoscopy who have a history
of chronic bronchitis [4].
It has been shown that chronic airway inflammation
with diffuse panbronchiolitis might play a role in exacer￾bations of this disorder and the acquired form of TBM
has been increasingly recognized as an important cause
of chronic respiratory symptoms [5]. In TBM, central
airway collapse is not closely related to airflow obstruc￾tion, and expiratory flow limitation at rest often occurs
in peripheral airways without central airway collapse [6].
This pathologic airway weakening can lead to a dy￾namic outflow obstruction associated with symptoms
(such as: dyspnea; orthopnea; intractable cough, and in￾ability to clear secretions) which can sometimes mimic
asthma worsening. Furthermore, TBM may also be asso￾ciated with a substantial invagination of the posterior
membrane of the tracheo-bronchial tree, an entity de￾fined as excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC). [7].
To our knowledge, the incidence of TBM in patients
with a reported history of asthma or Chronic Obstruct￾ive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has not been extensively
studied. However, several large studies in the general
population suggest that the overall incidence of TBM is
5-10% [8,9].
However, at present, it is not generally known in
which proportion patients with asthma have TBM or
EDAC, and if these conditions are related to asthma
severity.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the preva￾lence of both TBM and EDAC in a population of
asthmatics of different degrees of severity compared
to a reference group of subjects without any airway
obstruction.
Methods
A cohort of 202 non-smoking asthmatics was investi￾gated: 74 mild persistent, MPA (age 18–68 years; 35
males; mean FEV1 = 88.6% pred. ± 8.3sd); 63 moder￾ate asthmatics, MA (age 21–71 years; 30 males; mean
FEV1=71.3% pred. ± 9.1sd); 65 severe asthmatics, SA
(age 33–70 years; 25 males; mean FEV1 = 48.5%
pred. ±7.6sd.
Criteria used for defining asthma in the present study
were those accepted worldwide [10]. In particular,
asthma diagnosis stemmed from subjects’ family and
clinical data; from lung function tests (in particular, the
variability of their airway obstruction; the reversibility
(30′ after salbutamol 400 mcg) of their flow limitation
from basal values, and/or the measurement of their
bronchial response to methacholine).
All patients were already treated according to GINA
guidelines [10]. All patients were in stable conditions at
the time of their bronchoscopy.
Another cohort of 62 non smoking subjects without
any obstructive disease, NO (age 18–71 years; 38 males;
mean FEV1 98.6% pred. ± 2.7sd) was also investigated
from this point of view (during a bronchoscopy
performed as part of an unrelated investigation) as a ref￾erence group.
None of the subjects had a systemic disease or local￾ized conditions known as possible cause of TBM. The
study was approved by the local E.C. in date January
19th, 2010 (prot. n.: 1489).
Diagnosis
Bronchoscopic visualization of dynamic tracheal or
bronchial collapse remains the gold standard for TBM
diagnosis [11]. After the patients had signed the specific
informed consent, all bronchoscopies were performed
with topical anesthesia (lidocaine) and light sedation
(midazolam 1.25 - 2.5 mg ev). The patients were studied
in the supine position and had undergone standard spir￾ometry to determine FEV1 the day before broncoscopy.
During the examination, patients were able to breathe
spontaneously and follow commands to perform deep
breathing, forced exhalation, and cough maneuvers to
elicit the collapsibility of the airways. The bronchoscope
was introduced into the trachea, and at that point the
patient was instructed to perform forced inspiratory and
expiratory maneuvers with graded degrees of effort,
according to a standard TBM protocol [6]. The broncho￾scope was then advanced to 5 cm above the carina, and
the patient was requested to perform again graded
forced expiratory maneuvers. This procedure was then
repeated at the entrance of the right and left main bron￾chi. All bronchoscopies were video recorded and
reviewed after the procedure to assess the degree of air￾way collapse.
Obviously, the airways collapsed during forced expir￾ation, but in some cases the airway lumen was com￾pletely obliterated as the membranous trachea had
collapsed to the cartilaginous rings. Dynamic CT scan
images can define the normal range of intrathoracic tra￾cheal diameters and cross-sectional areas during forced
maneuvers, and it was shown that tracheal narrowing
was about 80% in patients with TBM vs 35% in healthy
men [12]; Stem et al. then recommended using a cutoff
of ≥ 70% narrowing on forced expiration as a diagnostic
threshold for TBM [12].

Classification
TBM and EDAC were classified according to FEMOS
classification, that addresses Functional status; Extent of
abnormalities notes; Morfology of the abnomarlity;
Origin of the abnormality, and Severity of the disease
process [7].
In the present study, only moderate (expiratory air￾ways collapse ≥ 75%) and severe (expiratory airway col￾lapse of 100%, such as, the airway walls make contact)
TBM or EDAC were considered.
Statistics
Quantitative variables were expressed as mean and
standard deviation; categorical variables as absolute and
relative frequencies. The Skewness test was used to
check the normality in distribution for quantitative vari￾ables. Data were compared by t-test and Mann–Whitney
test, CHI-square test, and Fisher test as appropriate.
The logistic regression model was used to estimate the
odds ratio and to control the role of confounding vari￾ables; p < 0,05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis was carried out by using STATA
Release 12 (Stata Corp LP, Texas, USA).
Results
Bronchoscopic visualization of trachea and main bronchi
was possible in all subjects, without significant adverse
events. A moderate desaturation and wheezing occurred
in 42 subjects immediately after the procedure, and they
were quickly recovered with inhaled salbutamol (400 μg
via spacer) and prednisone 40 mg e.v. All patients were
monitored in the 2 hours following the bronchoscopic
examination and were discharged from the Lung Unit
only with normal values for systemic blood pressure,
heart frequency and peripheral saturation.
General characteristics of non-obstructive and of asth￾matic subjects are reported in Table 1. Males were
significantly prevailing in subjects of the reference group
(p < 0.021); asthmatics were significantly older (p <
0.0001), and characterized by a lower mean FEV1 value
(p < 0.0001). The overall prevalence of TBM and EDAC
proved quite lower (only 1 case) in non asthmatic sub￾jects: therefore, no statistical inference is possible for
groups consisting of 1 statistical unit. When considering
the whole sample of asthmatics, TBM was present in 19
cases (9.4%) and EDAC in 62 cases (30.7%), being one of
these abnormalities of central airways detectable in
41.1% of a general population of asthmatics (Table 1).
Moreover, TBM was found in 2 (2.70%) and EDAC in
5 cases (6.75%) of mild persistent asthma (MPA), while
TBM was found in 5 (7.93%) and EDAC in 12 cases
(19.04%) of moderate persistent asthma (MA). Finally,
TBM was found in 12 (18.46%) and EDAC in 45 cases
(69.23%) of severe persistent asthma (SA). Both the
TBM and the EDAC prevalence, as well as their ratio,
are directly and significantly related (both p < 0.0001) to
asthma severity according to an exponential function,
particularly in the case of EDAC (Table 2).
When compared to that of asthmatics without any tra￾cheal abnormalities, the mean age in those with TBM or
EDAC was higher (56.4 ± 10.2sd yr vs 44.6 ±13.0sd yr,
p < 0.0001, and 51.8 ± 12.5sd yr vs 43.5 ± 12.8 sd yr,
p < 0.001, respectively).
The crude prevalence of thyroid disorders in the popu￾lation was 12.9% (34/264): in particular: thyroidectomy
52.9% (18/34); thyroiditis 26.5% (9/34); goiter 14.8%
(5/34); malignancy 2.9% (1/34); other 2.9% (1/34)
(Table 3). When the prevalence of thyroid disorders was
investigated by gender, the OR calculated was = 8.77
(95% CI = 2.94-35.13 (by the Fischer Exact Confidence
method), such as the probability for the presence of thy￾roid disturbances was 5-fold higher in females than in
males. Moreover, when the prevalence of both EDAC
and thyroid disorders was compared by gender, the OR
calculated was = 54.76 (95% CI = 17.48-213.06), such as,
the probability for the presence of thyroid disturbances
was 54-fold higher in females than in males with EDAC.
Discussion
During normal expiration, there is a physiologic reduc￾tion in all dimensions of intrathoracic airways; when
changes occurring during forced inspiration and expir￾ation are compared by a dynamic CT, a mean 35% de￾crease in the cross-sectional area of the trachea has been
described [12]. Thus, a certain degree of dynamic airway
collapse, characterized by invagination of the posterior
membrane and narrowing of the cross-sectional area of
the tracheobronchial tree, represents a physiologic event.
However, this phenomenon is exaggerated in some pa￾tients suffering from obstructive airway disease, or it
represents an isolated finding in some patients during
cough and forced expiration.

TBM is an increasingly recognized abnormality of the
central airways and generally results from weakness of
the tracheal or mainstem bronchial walls caused by ei￾ther softening of the supporting cartilaginous rings, or
redundancy of the connective tissue of the posterior
membrane due to a reduction in size and number of
elastic fibers, or both. TBM has been called tracheobron￾chial collapse, expiratory tracheobronchial collapse, ex￾piratory tracheobronchial stenosis, and tracheobronchial
dyskinesia. These various terms have not only provided
an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of
malacia and EDAC, but have also contributed to the
existing confusion concerning these obstructive airway
disorders and to maintain some of the uncertainty on the
optimal patients’ management. Most published studies
are case series and retrospective descriptions; in addition,
few investigators regard malacia and EDAC as separate
entities, often using the two words interchangeably.
The clinical impact of these abnormalities is quite
high. The pathologic weakening of the airway can
produce dynamic outflow obstruction and severe symp￾toms, such as: cough, dyspnea, and wheezing resistant to
corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators, stridor,
recurrent bronchitis or pneumonia, atelectasis, difficult
secretions clearing, and respiratory insufficiency. More￾over, air trapping was also observed with a higher fre￾quency and greater severity in patients with tracheo￾bronchomalacia when compared to patients of similar
ages without TBM [13], and up to 7% of patients with
severe diffuse TBM may require mechanical ventilation
due to respiratory failure. [14]. Current treatments in￾clude techniques that splint the central airways, such as
continuous positive pressure ventilation [15], silicone
airway stents [16] and surgical tracheobronchoplasty
[17]. Surgical central airway stabilization with posterior
tracheobronchial splinting using a polypropylene mesh
improves respiratory symptoms, health-related quality of
life, and functional status in highly selected patients with
severe symptomatic TBM [18].
The etiology of acquired TBM in many patients is not
obvious. TBM is often seen in association with COPD in
patients with a smoking history, thus leading to the in￾ference that chronic inflammation and smoking are im￾portant contributing factors [19].
Nevertheless, little is known concerning the mechan￾ism underlying the association between inflammation
and TBM or EDAC. Loring et al. [6] speculated that re￾peated mechanical stress from coughing or the high ex￾piratory pleural pressures during exercise in patients
with airflow obstruction might cause stretching and de￾generation of the posterior membranous portion of the
trachea and main bronchi over a period of years.
At present very few data concerning TBM or EDAC
epidemiology in asthma patients are available to our
knowledge. Data from the present study, carried out in a
consistent cohort of asthma patients of different severity
and in whom the diagnosis of TBM o EDAC was con￾firmed via dynamic broncoscopy, ascertained that the
prevalence of EDAC is directly related to asthma severity
and is particularly high in severe asthma, while EDAC is
much more frequent than TBM in asthmatic patients in￾dependently of asthma severity. This evidence supports
the hypothesis that the chronic persistency of substantial
airway inflammation within the airways can contribute
to impair expiratory airflow just affecting intrinsically
and persistently the structures of larger airways in a
great proportion of cases.
Thyroid disease and its association with TBM was doc￾umented, but only when tracheal cartilaginous ring can
be compromised by a tumour, or most commonly after
thyroidectomy, especially in patients with cancer [19].
Furthermore, in our study, thyroid disorders proved
highly concomitant in TBM and in EDAC, the latter
condition being much more represented in females, in￾dependently of asthma severity.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the presence of TBM or EDAC should
be considered whenever bronchial asthma persists

uncontrolled and unresponsive to an appropriate phar￾macological treatment. Moreover, in severe asthma the
presence of TBM or EDAC should be actively investi￾gated, not only when uncontrolled, bearing in mind the
range of non pharmacological treatment options that
could be offered to these patients. Furthermore, if the
occurrence of EDAC is highly probable in females with
thyroid disturbances, it is as much appropriate that thy￾roid function be investigated in females with EDAC.
