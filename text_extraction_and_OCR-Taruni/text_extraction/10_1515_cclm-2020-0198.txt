To the Editor,
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a form of respira￾tory and systemic zoonosis caused by a virus belonging 
to the Coronaviridae family, originated from the town of 
Wuhan in China, is still spreading around the world, thus 
assuming the dramatic features of a pandemic emergency 
[1]. According to the recent statistics of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the disease has already involved 
all continents, with over 80,000 diagnosed cases in 34 
different countries, and nearly 2700 deaths until Febru￾ary 26, 2020 [2]. Despite the severity of COVID-19  seems 
lower than that of the two previous coronavirus diseases, 
i.e. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS 
(Middle East respiratory syndrome), the long incubation 
period and the relatively low pathogenicity compared 
to that of the two previous homologous viruses are con￾tributing to sustain and amplify the outbreak inside and 
outside China.
Although the clinical characteristic of COVID-19 have 
been broadly defined [3], an outline of the most repre￾sentative laboratory abnormalities found in patients with 
COVID-2019 infection is still lacking to the best of our 
knowledge. It was previously highlighted that laboratory 
medicine plays an essential role in the early detection, 
diagnosis and management of many diseases [4]. COVID￾2019 makes no exception to this rule, whereby real-time 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) 
enables direct virus identification, whilst detection of 
anti-COVID-19 antibodies by means of fully-automated 
immunoassays is the mainstay of serological surveil￾lance [5]. Nevertheless, the role of laboratory diagnostics 
extends far beyond etiological diagnosis and epidemio￾logic surveillance, whereby in vitro diagnostic tests are 
commonly used for assessing disease severity, for defin￾ing the prognosis, for following-up patients, for guiding 
treatment and for their therapeutic monitoring [6]. There￾fore, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview on 
the most frequent laboratory abnormalities encountered 
in patients with COVID-2019 infection.
An electronic search was performed in Medline 
(PubMed interface), Scopus and Web of Science, using 
the keywords “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-
nCoV”or “COVID-19” without date (i.e. up to February 
24, 2020) or language restrictions. The title, abstract 
and full text (when available) of all articles identified 
according to these search criteria were scrutinized by 
the authors, and those describing significant laboratory 
abnormalities in patients with severe COVID-19 infec￾tion were finally selected. The references of identified 
documents were also crosschecked for detecting addi￾tional studies.
Overall, 217 articles could be originally identified 
using our search criteria, 206 of which were excluded 
after title, abstract or full text reading, because they did 
not report specific data on laboratory test results (data 
now shown, due to space constrains). Therefore, a total 
number of 11 studies were finally selected, eight of which 
reported the rate of abnormal laboratory test results, as 
summarized in Table 1 [7–14]. One additional study, pub￾lished by Pan et al. and involving 21 patients (71% women; 
age range, 25–63 years) with non-severe COVID-19 infec￾tion, did not clearly describe the rate of patients with 
laboratories abnormalities, but only reported the most 
frequent abnormalities, including increased values of 
C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
(ESR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer [15].
As regards prognostic laboratory data, which may be 
even more vital for the timely identification of patients at

higher risk of adverse outcome, an interesting report has 
been published by Wang et al. who examined the behavior 
of six laboratory parameters throughout 19 days of hospital 
admission in 138 patients with COVID-19 infection (33 with 
severe disease), five of whom died during their hospi￾tal stay [16]. Several significant differences were noted 
between patients who needed admission to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) and those who did not, especially encom￾passing higher white blood cell (WBC) count (1.5-fold), 
higher neutrophil count (1.7-fold), lower lymphocyte count 
(0.9-fold), as well as higher values of LDH (2.1-fold), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) (1.5-fold), aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST) (1.8-fold), total bilirubin (1.2-fold), creatinine 
(1.1-fold), cardiac troponin I (2.2-fold), D-dimer (2.5-fold) 
and procalcitonin (1.2-fold). As regards this last parameter, 
the rate of patients with abnormal values admitted to the 
ICU was over 3-fold higher than that of those who were 
not (75% vs. 22%; p < 0.001). It has also been reported that 
non-survivors more frequently developed lymphopenia 
and leukocytosis, along with abnormal values of D-dimer, 
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. In the study of Zhang 
et  al. based on 140 COVID-19 patients (58  with severe 
disease) [7], significantly higher values of D-dimer (2-fold), 
CRP (1.7-fold) and procalcitonin (2-fold) could be observed 
in patients with severe disease compared to those with a 
milder form. In the study published by Huang et al. involv￾ing 140 COVID-19 patients (13  with severe disease) [8], 
significant predictors of ICU admission were leukocytosis 
(2.0-fold increased in ICU patients), neutrophilia (4.4-fold 
increased), lymphopenia (0.4-fold, i.e. decreased), pro￾thrombin time (PT; 1.14-fold increased), D-dimer (4.8-fold 
increased), albumin (0.8-fold, i.e. decreased), ALT (1.8-
fold increased), total bilirubin (1.3-fold increased), LDH 
(1.4-fold increased) and procalcitonin, whose values were 
increased in 25% of patients who were admitted to the ICU 
compared with 0% who were not (p = 0.029). Similar find￾ings emerged from the article published by Liu et al. who 
found that disease severity could be predicted by lympho￾penia, neutrophilia, low values of albumin, as well as by 
increased values of LDH and CRP [11]. Finally, Tang et al. 
followed-up 183 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infec￾tion (54% women; mean age, 54 years) during their hospi￾tal stay [17], and found that coagulation parameters were 
more frequently deranged in those who died (n = 21) than in 
those who survived. Specifically, the values of PT, D-dimer 
and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) were 
found to be 1.14-, 3.5- and 1.9-fold higher in non-survivors 
than in survivors, respectively. Overall, 71.4% of patients 
who died fulfilled the criteria for diagnosing disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC) compared to only 0.6% of 
those who survived.
Although some limitations must be acknowledged in 
our analysis of the current scientific literature (i.e. limited 
samples size, all COVID-19 cases originating from the 
same country, operative definitions are still underway, 
some clinical studies are still ongoing or undergoing pub￾lication), the currently available data suggests that many 
laboratory parameters are deranged in patients with 
COVID-19 (Table 1), and some of these may also be con￾sidered significant predictors of adverse clinical outcomes 
(Table 2). With the exception of the study of Liu et al. which 
only included children with mild COVID-19 infection, the 
most frequent abnormalities were lymphopenia (35–75% 
of cases), increased values of CRP (75–93% of cases), LDH 
(27–92% of cases), ESR (up to 85% of cases) and D-dimer 
(36–43% of cases), as well as low concentrations of serum 
albumin (50–98% of cases) and hemoglobin (41–50%). 
Many laboratory abnormalities were instead predictive of 
adverse outcome, as summarized in Table 2.
A particular mention shall be made for procalci￾tonin and coagulation tests. The former test does not 
appear substantially altered in patients with COVID-19 at 
admission, but the progressive increase of its value seem￾ingly mirrors a worse prognosis. This is not unexpected, 
whereby serum procalcitonin levels are typically normal 
in patients with viral infections (or viral sepsis), whilst its 
gradual increase probably mirrors bacterial superinfec￾tion [18], which may then contribute to drive the clinical 
course towards unfavorable progression. The measure￾ment of other innovative sepsis biomarkers, such as pre￾sepsin, for example, would probably help in increasing 
the accuracy in identification of severe COVID-19 cases, 
as well as for improving the current approach used for 
mortality risk prediction [19]. As concerns hemostasis

tests, the evidence that laboratory criteria for diagnosing 
DIC are present in nearly three-fourths of patients who 
died underscores the critical role of these tests in this 
and other clinical settings [20], thus suggesting that their 
assessment shall be considered a routine part of COVID￾19 patient monitoring.
