Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was first described by
Moschowitz in 1924.1 Although it is now well recognised, being
characterised by the classic pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia,
microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA), renal impairment,
and fluctuating neurological signs, its precise pathophysiology
remains elusive. Several other syndromes including haemolytic
uraemic syndrome (HUS), eclampsia and HELLP (haemolysis,
elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) are also characterised by
MAHA and this has given rise to the concept that they might
represent a spectrum of disease. However, recent independent work
by Tsai and Furlan indicates that TTP and HUS appear to be distinct
pathophysiological entities, which might explain in part the wide
variation in response to treatment that is seen in clinical practice.
Clinical variants
Several variants of TTP are recognised. Most cases are defined as
single episode TTP: in these patients there is no identifiable
precipitant and no subsequent recurrence. Because survival has
improved with advances in treatment, it is now apparent that a few
patients continue to relapse at infrequent intervals: in one study it
was estimated that 11–36% fall into this category, known as
intermittent TTP (fig 1), with relapses occurring up to eight years
after the index episode.2 In some instances, the index or subsequent
episode might be precipitated by an identifiable cause, resulting in
secondary TTP. Several drugs have been implicated including
mitomycin C, ticlopidine, cyclosporin, oral contraceptives, and
quinine. Perhaps those most closely linked are ticlopidine and
cyclosporin. Ticlopidine characteristically results in TTP after two
to four weeks of use,3 whereas cyclosporin is a recognised risk
factor in post-allogeneic bone marrow transplant associated TTP,
along with total body irradiation conditioning. Pregnancy and


systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are other associations and
might account, in part, for the female preponderance (male to
female ratio, 1 : 2). Anecdotally, TTP also appears …
