Establishing long-term allograft acceptance without the requirement for continuous immunosuppression, a
condition known as allograft tolerance, is a highly desirable therapeutic goal in solid organ transplantation.
Determining which recipients would benefitfrom withdrawal or minimization ofimmunosuppression would
be greatly facilitated by biomarkers predictive of tolerance. In this study, we identified the largest reported
cohortto our knowledge oftolerant renal transplant recipients, as defined by stable graftfunction and receiv￾ing no immunosuppression for more than 1 year, and compared their gene expression profiles and peripheral
blood lymphocyte subsets with those of subjects with stable graftfunction who are receiving immunosuppres￾sive drugs as well as healthy controls.In addition to being associated with clinical and phenotypic parameters,
renal allograft tolerance was strongly associated with a B cell signature using several assays. Tolerant subjects
showed increased expression of multiple B cell differentiation genes, and a set of just 3 of these genes distin￾guished tolerant from nontolerant recipients in a unique test set of samples. This B cell signature was associ￾ated with upregulation of CD20 mRNA in urine sediment cells and elevated numbers of peripheral blood naive
and transitional B cells in tolerant participants compared with those receiving immunosuppression. These
results point to a critical role for B cells in regulating alloimmunity and provide a candidate set of genes for
wider-scale screening of renal transplant recipients.
Introduction
Advances in immunosuppression over 2 decades have led to vast 
improvements in both control of acute rejection and short-term 
graft survival in renal transplantation. However, similar improve￾ments in long-term outcomes have not yet been achieved, and 
concerns over the morbidity of lifelong regimens of immuno￾suppressive drugs remain (1, 2). Establishing long-term allograft 
acceptance without the requirement for continuous immunosup￾pression, a condition known as allograft tolerance, is therefore a 
highly desirable therapeutic goal in kidney transplantation (3–5).
Unlike liver transplantation, where it is estimated that up to 
20% of recipients may be withdrawn from all immunosuppression 
(6–12), tolerance to renal allografts appears to be far less frequent 
(13–15). Although tolerance has been achieved in numerous ani￾mal models of renal transplantation (16), attempts to induce long￾term allograft tolerance in humans have been far less successful, 
and may be complicated by the potential loss of the engrafted kid￾ney during immunosuppression minimization or withdrawal.
Several recent studies have attempted to identify biomarkers of 
tolerance in liver and kidney transplantation (15, 17–20). In liver 
transplantation, the proportion of γδ T cells (specifically TCR δ1 
cells; ref. 19) and the ratio of plasmacytoid to myeloid dendritic 
cells (20) and B cells (18) were shown to be increased in tolerant 
liver transplant recipients relative to those stable on immunosup￾pression (9, 19, 21). Additionally, specific patterns of expressed 
genes were shown to be associated with tolerant participants com￾pared with those stable on immunosuppression and with healthy 
controls (19, 21). Similarly, 2 studies have shown that tolerant kid￾ney transplant recipients have distinct patterns of expressed genes 
and T cell receptor gene use (13, 15).
In this study, we recruited the largest reported cohort to our 
knowledge of tolerant kidney transplant recipients (n = 25), 20 of 
whom ceased taking immunosuppression as a result of medica￾tion nonadherence. We sought to identify immune parameters 
that would discriminate tolerant individuals from subjects with 
stable allograft function while on immunosuppression, as well 
as healthy (nontransplanted) controls. We found that tolerant 
patients exhibited increased numbers of total and naive B cells 
and had enhanced expression of B cell differentiation and activa￾tion genes compared with subjects receiving immunosuppression. 
Most notably, the tolerant cohort differentially expressed 3 B cell 
genes that were highly predictive of tolerance in a new test set of 
patients. These markers are strong candidates for clinical testing 
as a means to predict kidney transplant recipients who may benefit 
from minimization or withdrawal of immunosuppression, and for 
monitoring their status during immunosuppression withdrawal.

at least 1 year (TOL, n = 25); those with stable graft function while 
on immunosuppression (SI, n = 33); and healthy (nontransplanted) 
control subjects (HC, n = 42). Participants in the TOL and SI groups 
had excellent renal function, even though TOL participants had 
ceased taking immunosuppressive medications for at least 1 year. 
Ages, genders, and primary diseases leading to renal failure were 
similar between the TOL and SI groups (Table 1). There was no 
statistical difference in the frequency of humoral sensitization in 
these 2 groups, as 8 of 25 TOL and 15 of 33 SI patients had detect￾able antibodies directed against HLA molecules. With respect to 
alloantibodies specific for donor HLA molecules, 1 of the 20 indi￾viduals in the TOL cohort for whom sufficient samples were pres￾ent to allow analysis was found to have antibodies directed against 
donor HLA molecules, whereas 4 of the 31 evaluable patients in the 
SI group had donor-directed anti-HLA antibodies. The differences 
between the groups were not statistically significant.
Participants in the TOL group were more closely matched for 
HLA than the SI group (P < 0.05; Table 1). Whereas the major￾ity of our TOL group was HLA matched, 5 participants were not 
matched for any HLA antigens. Time from transplant to enroll￾ment was found to be significantly higher 
in the TOL group (P < 0.05), while the 
number of patients with cadaveric donors 
was significantly greater in the SI group 
(P < 0.05). There were no other signifi￾cant differences in clinical assessments 
between these groups in this study. Sev￾eral assays were performed on periph￾eral blood, including immunopheno￾typing and gene expression profiling by 
microarray and multiplex real-time PCR 
(Supplemental Table 1; supplemental 
material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI39933DS1).
B cell gene signatures distinguish TOL from SI 
participants. For the purposes of predictive 
modeling using gene expression studies, 
patients in the TOL and SI groups were 
subdivided, based on study enrollment, 
into training sets (TOL-TRN, n = 19; SI￾TRN, n = 27) and test sets (TOL-TST, n = 6; 
SI-TST, n = 6). All test set patients were 
identified, and samples collected, subse￾quent to the identification and study of 
the training set patients and therefore are 
an independent cohort.
Microarrays were used to detect 
expressed gene profiles of whole-blood 
total RNA from subjects in the TOL-TRN 
and SI-TRN groups. RNA samples were 
selected, and cRNA was made and hybrid￾ized in 5 batches. The strategy used for 
normalizing batch effects involved build￾ing batch as a covariant into the statistical 
models used in our analyses. Statistical 
analysis for differentially expressed genes 
between these 2 groups was performed, 
and the top differentially expressed genes 
were ranked in order, based on their mean 
fold change differences.
We found that 5 unique genes — TUBB2A, TCL1A, BRDG1, HTPAP, 
and PPPAPDC1B — reached statistical significance after a false dis￾covery rate (FDR) correction was applied to the data. Of the 30 genes 
found to have a 2-fold increase in expression in the TOL-TRN ver￾sus SI-TRN group (Figure 1), 22 were B cell specific (as defined in 
the OMIM database; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim). Many 
of these genes are involved in B cell activation and differentiation, 
including genes encoding Ig heavy, light, and joining chains and 
HLA (22, 23). In contrast, few genes were observed to be more highly 
expressed in the SI-TRN group. One of these, TUBB2A, was highly 
differentially expressed (7-fold difference). Overexpression of this 
gene may be due to prolonged use of calcineurin inhibitors, which 
have previously been shown to induce tubulin expression (24). Com￾parison of whole-blood total RNA from TOL-TRN and HC groups 
revealed no significant differences in expression levels. The similarity 
in profiles between TOL-TRN and HC groups was illustrated using 
hierarchical clustering of the 30 genes that were more than 2-fold 
differentially expressed between TOL-TRN and SI-TRN (Figure 1).
Further evidence for B cell involvement in tolerance was pro￾vided by gene expression profiles of urinary cell sediments. Of

the 18 genes tested by quantitative real-time PCR, only the CD20
transcript was significantly higher in TOL-TRN than SI-TRN 
participants (Figure 2). We performed the same analyses on urine 
sedimentary cells from HC and found significantly lower expres￾sion of CD20 and FOXP3 in HC relative to TOL-TRN (Figure 2, 
A and B). We also found significantly lower expression of CD3
and Perforin in HC compared with TOL-TRN (Figure 2, C and D). 
Collectively, these findings are consistent with healthy subjects 
having few or no lymphocytes in their urine; indeed, urine from 
7 of the 25 HC tested did not have sufficient RNA because of their 
low or no numbers of urine sedimentary cells. These samples were 
excluded from our analysis.
Multiplex real-time PCR confirms a B cell gene signature and identifies 
3 genes that predict tolerance in a test set of patients. Multiplex real-time 
PCR was performed on all participants to develop a more quanti￾tative approach for defining tolerance-specific expressed gene pro￾files and to support our microarray findings. Probe-primer sets for 
228 genes were made for the multiplex real-time PCR, which was 
run on all participants in a single batch (Supplemental Table 2). 
These genes were selected from the following lists: (a) the top 50 
differentially expressed genes from our microarray analyses; (b) 
genes defined as tolerant specific in liver transplant recipients, as 
reported by Martinez-Llordella et al. (21); (c) genes found to be 
family members of our differentially expressed genes identified by 
microarray; and (d) genes believed to play a role in immunological 
tolerance as reported in the literature, such as CD40.
Statistical analysis of the multiplex real-time PCR data revealed 
31 unique genes that were different between the TOL-TRN and 
SI-TRN groups (P < 0.05; Figure 3), whereas no genes were sig￾nificantly different between TOL and HC (Supplemental Table 3). 
Of those found to be differentially expressed in TOL-TRN versus 
SI-TRN, 17 were originally detected by microarray. None of the 
genes found to be involved in liver transplant tolerance by Marti￾nez-Llordella et al. (21) were differentially expressed between our 
TOL and SI cohorts. Again, most of the genes overexpressed in the 
TOL cohort were B cell specific (26 of 30), with many encoding 
κ/λ light chains of Ig.
Using the 228 genes identified by multiplex real-time PCR, we 
performed feature selection and applied linear discriminate analy￾sis (LDA) to define a smaller set of genes, or classifier genes that 
would be highly predictive for tolerance based on TOL-TRN and 
SI-TRN participants. Using our training set with leave-one-out

cross-validation (LOOCV), the LDA model found 3 genes to be 
most predictive, giving a positive predictive value (PPV) of 83% and 
a negative predictive value (NPV) of 84% (Table 2). To directly test 
the predictive value of these 3 genes, we used a separate test set 
cohort of 6 TOL and 6 SI patients (receiving standard triple-drug 
immunosuppression), termed TOL-TST and SI-TST, respectively. 
All 6 TOL-TST participants were correctly identified as TOL, and 
5 of 6 SI-TST participants were correctly identified as SI, yielding 
PPV and NPV of 86% and 100%, respectively (Table 3).
The genes used in this predictive model are IGKV4-1, IGLL1, and 
IGKV1D-13; their expression levels for each patient are shown in 
Figure 4. These genes clearly separated TOL from SI patients for 
the majority of participants in the training set and for all but 1 
SI participant in the test set (Figure 4). Box plots of mRNA copy 
numbers for each of these genes are shown in Figure 5. All 3 of 
these genes encode κ or l light chains, which are upregulated 
during the transition from pre- to mature B cells and during 
class switch and receptor editing that occurs after stimulation of 
mature B cells with antigen.
Flow cytometry of whole blood revealed increased numbers of naive 
B cells in TOL participants. We next performed immunophenotyping 
on whole blood samples shipped overnight from the collection site 
to a centralized flow cytometry facility. Subsets for analysis were 
selected from the 32 possible combinations of each 5-color panel 
(i.e., 25). Each unique combination based on the selected region 
combinations used (approximately 15 per panel) were treated as 
independent variables for the purposes of statistical analysis of the 
flow data in total. A multiple test correction was applied to the 
data, and those populations determined to be significantly differ￾ent between TOL and HC and between TOL 
and SI were defined. A significant difference 
was found between the TOL and SI groups in 
the number of total B cells (CD19+) and naive 
B cells (CD19+CD27–IgM+IgD+; Figure 6, A and 
B). The mean B cell number of the TOL cohort 
was significantly greater than in the SI group 
(P < 0.01), but did not reach significance com￾pared with the HC cohort (P = 0.10). However, 
there were significant differences between the 
TOL cohort and both the SI and HC group 
with respect to naive B cell numbers (P ≤ 0.05, 
Figure 6B). In addition, CD86+CD19+ B cells 
and memory B cells (CD19+CD27+IgM+IgD+) 
were significantly different between the TOL 
and HC cohorts (P < 0.01 and P = 0.03, respec￾tively, Figure 6, C and D).
Many subpopulations of lymphocytes were 
measured in our analyses (Supplemental Table 4), and we did find 
other lymphocyte subpopulations that were significantly different 
between the TOL and SI or TOL and HC groups. These included 
HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells and NK cells, among others (data not 
shown). Of those that were significantly different, we highlight 
here the B cells and B cell subsets, as these differences correlated 
with our findings using microarrays and PCR.
Statistical analyses of total wbc count means for each group 
showed no differences, indicating that the observed group-spe￾cific differences were not caused by overall changes in the number 
of total wbcs. Mean wbc counts for the TOL, SI, and HC groups 
were 6.7 × 103, 8.1 × 103, and 5.8 × 103 cells/μl, respectively. Rather, 
there appeared to be a redistribution of B cell subsets in the TOL 
group relative to the others, in which the IgM+IgD+ cells made up 
a greater proportion of the B cells in TOL participants than in the 
other groups. Furthermore, the observation that selected popu￾lations of B cells distinguished TOL kidney transplant recipients 
from HC subjects suggests that the B cell signature associated with 
tolerance is not simply a consequence of immunosuppression.
As the flow cytometric studies above analyzed all of our patients, 
we sought to validate the phenotypic B cell signature in an inde￾pendent set of kidney transplant recipient patients. For this pur￾pose, we reexamined our subjects’ frozen peripheral blood mono￾nuclear cells (PBMCs) and compared them with frozen PBMCs 
collected from participants enrolled in the Indices of Tolerance 
(IOT) study of tolerant renal transplant recipients (25). These stud￾ies were performed with additional surface markers to be able to 
differentiate between naive and transitional cells and discriminate 
transitional subsets (26). Frozen PBMCs from our patients and

3 of the IOT cohorts (TOL; SI, specifically calcineurin inhibitors; 
and HC) were studied by flow cytometry. The percentage of total 
B cells and naive B cells in the lymphocyte gate was higher in each 
TOL group compared with the respective SI group in both our 
Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) samples and the IOT samples 
(Figure 7, A and B). We noted lower numbers of naive B cells in 
all groups of samples provided by the IOT collaborative relative 
to our samples. Differences in freezing methods may have caused 
these shifts. Importantly, the patients in the IOT cohort were not 
as well HLA-matched with their donors as were those in our TOL 
cohort, which suggests that the increased B cell numbers were not 
a direct result of HLA matching.
Next we examined transitional B cells (CD19+CD38+CD24+IgD+) 
in these samples. These cells were of interest because of our gene 
signature and the regulatory role that has been proposed in murine 
models for cells with a similar immature phenotype (27). In both 
IOT and ITN samples, there were increased numbers of transition￾al B cells in the TOL versus SI group comparisons (Figure 7C).
Additionally, predictive modeling of the frozen flow assays was 
performed, in which we treated the ITN frozen flow results as a 
training set and the IOT flow results as an independent test set. In 
these analyses we also showed transitional B cells to be the most 
predictive, with a PPV of 85% and NPV of 96% in training using

specificity, 75%) in the European samples that served as the test 
set (Tables 4 and 5).
Elevated expression of intracellular IL-10 in TOL patients. Finally, 
because we observed increases in B cell numbers and B cell sub￾populations in TOL and HC patients, we sought to determine 
whether these cells produce immunomodulatory cytokines, such 
as IL-10 or TGFβ, that might be implicated in tolerance (27, 28). 
Thus, intracellular cytokine staining was performed on frozen 
PBMCs from 21 TOL, 32 SI, and 13 HC patients. The cells were 
studied both unstimulated and cultured in the presence of PMA 
plus ionomycin for 5 hours. Total B cells and 6 subsets, including 
T1 and T2 transitional B cells (CD38+CD24+), switched memory 
(CD27+IgD–), CD27– memory (CD27–IgD–), naive and T3 transi￾tional (CD27–IgD+), unswitched memory (CD27+IgD+), and plas￾mablasts (CD27+CD38+IgD–), were analyzed for IL-10 and TGFβ
intracellular staining.
We observed a statistically significant increase in T1 plus T2 
transitional B cells expressing IL-10 in the TOL group relative 
to the SI or HC groups (Figure 8A). Such a result must be inter￾preted with caution, however, as the overall percentages were 
extremely low, with many samples containing no IL-10–produc￾ing cells, and with a large overlap in the range of the groups. This 
may be the result of using stimulation conditions that were lim￾ited in length and intensity in order to maintain the cell surface 
phenotype and thus determine IL-10 production within different 
B cell subpopulations. No differences in the number of TGFβ￾expressing B cells or subsets between cells from TOL or any other 
group were found (Figure 8B).
Discussion
This report, along with the companion study (25), is thus far the 
largest study to our knowledge of tolerant renal transplant recipi￾ents, both in terms of the number of participants studied and the 
variety of biological parameters analyzed. Most significantly, not 
only did our study identify what we believe to be new biomark￾ers of tolerance, it confirmed these markers across 3 independent 
cohorts of kidney transplant recipients, with varying degrees of 
HLA matching and differing patient demographics and geogra￾phy. That said, many clinical factors associated with tolerance in 
this study are also known to identify low-risk kidney transplant 
recipient populations. Clinically, our TOL cohort received well￾matched kidneys from living donors, and only 1 of the evaluable 
patients had humoral sensitization to the donor; conversely, 4 par￾ticipants of our SI group had donor-specific antibodies.
This observation contrasts with that of Roussey-Kesler et al. 
(14), for whom the majority of tolerant kidney transplant recipi￾ents received allografts from deceased donors that were not well 
matched. Of their 10 participants, 5 experienced at least 1 episode 
of acute rejection, and 3 developed anti-donor HLA antibodies. 
Whereas the main reason for discontinuing immunosuppression 
in that study was life-threatening infections or malignancies, in 
the present study, discontinuation of immunosuppression in 20 
of 25 participants was due to medication nonadherence, with the 
other 5 ceasing medication under medical supervision for com￾plications associated with immunosuppression. Therefore, the 
results reported here may be more relevant to the goal of iden￾tification of clinically stable participants that may benefit from 
immunosuppressive drug withdrawal.
The expressed gene signature identified in this study distin￾guished TOL from SI participants and primarily consisted of 
B cell–specific genes, in particular genes involved in B cell differ￾entiation. The association of B cell biomarkers and the tolerant 
phenotype was confirmed by flow cytometric analyses, which dis￾tinguished TOL not only from SI, but also from HC. These results 
suggest that this fingerprint may not be simply a consequence of 
differences induced by immunosuppression.

We were able to narrow this signature down to 3 genes that pre￾dicted tolerance with 100% accuracy in our test set of patients. 
Because we found that this signature of 3 genes was highly pre￾dictive for tolerance, a simple PCR assay may prove to be an easy 
test for screening kidney transplant patients that may benefit 
from weaning immunosuppression. Moreover, these gene expres￾sion analyses, combined with flow cytometry, may help to iden￾tify drug treatment regimens that promote tolerance 
based on an appearance of this protolerance signa￾ture. Importantly, these 3 genes are all expressed dur￾ing the differentiation of B cells from pre- to mature 
B cells or during B cell activation–induced transition. 
This suggests that transitioning or maturing B cells 
are involved in tolerance induction and/or mainte￾nance; alternatively, these cells may be suppressed by 
immunosuppression. Studies have shown that mature 
B cells in transition after antigen stimulation undergo 
receptor editing as means of promoting tolerance to 
self antigens (29, 30). Although receptor editing is 
believed to take place centrally in the bone marrow, it is possible 
that this mechanism is used peripherally in transplant recipients, 
as also shown in autoimmune models (31).
Our B cell gene signature correlates in part with findings of 
Brouard et al. (15), who, in cDNA microarray studies, found that 
transcripts of CD20, a trans-membrane protein expressed on 
pre- and mature B cells, were differentially expressed in tolerant

kidney transplant recipients compared with other cohorts. When 
we mapped genes associated with tolerance from their study to 
the microarray and assessed their expression in our subjects, only 
CD20 was found to be increased in our TOL group. This was con￾firmed in our multiplex real-time PCR assay. None of the other 
tolerance-associated genes from that study were differentially 
expressed in our TOL participants compared with other groups in 
our study. However, it should be noted that the study by Brouard 
et al. compared the tolerant patient group to a group described 
as nontolerant. This group was composed of both patients doing 
well on immunosuppression and those with established chronic 
allograft nephropathy and/or interstitial fibrosis and tubular 
atrophy without evidence of any specific etiology (IFTA) and thus 
is not directly comparable to our comparison group composed 
only of SI patients.
Our choice to limit the comparison group to stable patients 
doing well without chronic allograft nephropathy/IFTA was 
based on the concept that this population is the most clini￾cally relevant, as these individuals would be considered candi￾dates for immunosuppressive minimization, whereas those with 
IFTA would not. The genes found in our signature also differed 
from those reported by Martinez-Llordella et al. (21); however, it 
should be noted that they examined liver transplant recipients, 
a group in which tolerance is recognized as being more common 
and for which the mechanisms of tolerance induction and main￾tenance are likely to be different.
Comparisons of microarray data from our study and the IOT 
study profile (25) revealed increased CD20 and TCL1A expression 
in the TOL groups of both studies. TCL1A differences are notewor￾thy because expression of this oncoprotein is highest in immature 
cells but is low or absent in mature B cells; therefore, its overexpres￾sion in the TOL group appears to reflect the abundance of tran￾sitional cells (32). Similarly, the TOL group displayed increased 
expression of VH4-34, which is also preferentially expressed in tran￾sitional and naive cells compared with memory cells (33). Our 3 
most predictive genes, IGKV4-1, IGLLA, and IGKV1D-13, were not 
part of the IOT or Brouard gene list (15), most likely because their 
analyses were performed on Agilent and cDNA microarrays, which 
have a much more restricted set of genes, and because of differ￾ences in RNA purification methods, which have been shown to 
affect expressed gene profiles (34).
Our observation of increased total B cell numbers and naive 
B cells in the peripheral blood of TOL suggests that these cells may 
be important regulators of the antidonor immune response. Naive 
B cells are the major population of cells in the peripheral B cell pool 
and are known to be poor antigen-presenting cells for naive T cells 
(35, 36). Antigens presented by naive B cells have been shown to ren￾der animals tolerant (37) and were recently shown to stimulate naive 
T cells toward development into regulatory as opposed to effector 
T cells (38). Another B cell subset — unswitched memory cells — that 
we found to be elevated in TOL patients has also been reported to 
promote the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 (39).
However, functional studies performed on these B cell subsets 
did not unequivocally demonstrate a cytokine-mediated regulatory 
mechanism. We found no evidence of increased TGFβ-expressing 
B cells or B cell subpopulations in the TOL group relative to the SI 
or HC groups. In the case of IL-10, as noted previously, the results, 
while statistically significant, must be interpreted cautiously. Fur￾ther studies will be necessary to determine whether these cells are 
truly associated with tolerance after renal transplantation, and, if 
so, whether they play a causative role and by what mechanism they 
do so. A potential role for B cells in transplantation tolerance is

consistent with recent reports demonstrating a role for regulatory 
B cells in murine models of chronic inflammation (40–42), autoim￾mune inflammation induced by apoptotic cells (43), and transplant 
tolerance induced by treatment with antibody to CD45RB (44). As 
suggested by these and other studies, it remains to be determined 
whether B cells possess direct regulatory properties or act through 
the production of regulatory cytokines or antibodies (41, 42).
Finally, it is important to state that it is also possible that our 
findings of elevated B cells and B cell subsets represent a signa￾ture that is a consequence of tolerance, and not a cause of it. This 
of course would not diminish the usefulness of such a signature 
in a clinical setting. We also cannot exclude the possibility that 
immunosuppression influences the genes and cell populations 
measured for this study; however, our differences between TOL 
and HC patients point to a signature specific for the tolerant state. 
Moreover, we observed 4 SI patients who exhibited the putative 
tolerance signature and thus may reflect predisposition to the tol￾erant phenotype while receiving immunosuppression.
Overall, our findings have important implications for the long￾term management of immunosuppression in kidney allograft 
recipients and provide experimental evidence for a signature 
of tolerance. Evidence of increased B cells in a subset of SI par￾ticipants, as well as increases in the 3 genes described, could be 
used for the design of a clinical research agenda to prospectively 
evaluate potential markers of tolerance and provide a rationale for 
immunosuppression minimization and withdrawal in investiga￾tional settings. Alternatively, as a patient’s immunosuppression 
is minimized, these same markers could be used to monitor for 
safety and potentially identify individuals that could be develop￾ing a tolerant state.
Importantly, the overwhelmingly B cell–centric signature that 
was uncovered raises important questions regarding the mecha￾nisms of allograft tolerance. Whether this indicates a causal role 
for B cells or specific B cell subpopulations in the tolerant state is 
as yet unknown. Nonetheless, these data provide the impetus for 
future exploration of tolerance-inducing approaches aimed at pro￾moting the development of naive and/or transitional B cells with 
regulatory functions, as has recently been reported in a nonhuman 
model of islet transplantation (45).
Methods
Participant recruitment and study protocol. 100 adult renal transplant recipi￾ents and healthy volunteers were recruited nationwide at 4 participating 
centers between 2004 and 2007: Emory University, NIH, Swedish Medical 
Center, and University of Wisconsin. The protocol was approved by the 
IRB of each participating center, and by a DSMB convened by the Nation￾al Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Informed consents were 
obtained from all patients. Blood samples were collected by either standard 
phlebotomy (200 ml total volume) or leukapheresis.
Renal allograft recipients were enrolled into 2 groups: TOL (n = 25), 
defined as individuals who, for at least 1 year prior to enrollment, had 
not taken immunosuppressive medications and had stable renal function 
and serum creatinine within 25% of baseline (as evaluated by 3 experi￾enced transplant physicians); and SI (n = 33), with clinically stable renal 
function (using the same criteria as TOL) while on a maintenance triple￾drug immunosuppressive regimen (including a calcineurin or mamma￾lian target of rapamycin inhibitor, an antiproliferative agent, and cor￾ticosteroids). An additional group of normal HC participants (n = 42) 
with no known history of renal disease/dysfunction or evidence of acute 
medical illness was enrolled. Breakdown of samples used in each assay are 
shown in Supplemental Table 1.
For the purposes of predictive modeling and verification of our initial 
findings, we divided the TOL participants into a training set (TOL-TRN; 
n = 19) and a test set (TOL-TST; n = 6) based on enrollment prior to or after 
November 2007, respectively. The SI group was also divided into a training 
set (SI-TRN; n = 27) and a test set (SI-TST; n = 6) for modeling and verifica￾tion, also based on enrollment timing.
Finally, an independent set of kidney transplant recipient patients was 
collected in Europe (25), and frozen PBMCs from this collection were used 
for flow cytometry analysis. Frozen PBMCs from our patients and 3 of the 
European cohorts (1 TOL, 1 HC, and 1 SI, specifically calcineurin inhibi￾tors), were studied by flow cytometry at the same time in an independent 
laboratory (see below).
HLA typing. Whole blood from recipients and donors (when samples were 
available) was collected and frozen in cryotubes, then shipped to a central 
laboratory (UCSF Immunogenetics and Transplantation Laboratory) for 
automated nucleotide sequencing, which was performed from genomic 
DNA by selective amplification (PCR) of target exons from each locus for a 
particular allele. Loci sequenced included Class I HLA (HLA-A, -B, and -C) 
and Class II HLA (HLA-DRB1/3/4/5, -DQA1, and -DQB1). Nucleotide 
sequencing was performed as previously described (46).
HLA anti-donor cross-matching. Initial screening for HLA antibodies on 
blinded samples was performed at a central laboratory (Emory University 
Histocompatibility Laboratory) by flow cytometry using FlowPRA Screen￾ing beads (One Lambda Inc.). Antibody specificities of positive samples 
were determined as described previously (47) using the LabScreen Single 
Antigen assay (One Lambda Inc.).
Urine quantitative RT-PCR. RNAlater (Ambion) was added to urinary cell 
pellets from urine samples (50–100 ml) centrifuged at room temperature 
(2,000 g) for 30 minutes in order to extract total RNA. Samples were blind￾ed and stored at –80°C prior to quantitative RT-PCR on 18 select genes 
(Granzyme B, Perforin, PI9, IL4, IL2, IL10, IFNG, CD3, CD20, CD25, CD103, 
FoxP3, CTLA4, TGFB, CTGF, IP10, MIG, and CXCR3) with 18S RNA, used as 
a control, and BK virus, as previously described (48).
Flow cytometry. Whole blood was collected in 10-ml glass sodium hepa￾rin tubes (Becton Dickinson Vacutainer) and shipped ambient overnight 
to the ITN Flow Cytometry Core (Roswell Park Cancer Institute). Using a

stain-lyse method, cells from blinded samples were stained with 5-color 
monoclonal antibody panels conjugated to FITC, PE, PERCP, PECY7, or 
APC (Becton Dickinson; ref. 49). Marker/fluorochrome combinations used 
are described in Supplemental Table 4.
For flow cytometry on frozen cells, PBMCs were stained in PBS plus 
2 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, 5% normal mouse serum, and 5% normal rat serum 
on ice for 30 minutes with fluorochrome-conjugated mouse anti-human 
monoclonal antibodies (see Supplemental Table 4). After washing with 
PBS plus 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA, cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD 
aqua–fluorescent reactive dye (Invitrogen) in PBS on ice for 30 minutes, 
then fixed with 0.5% formaldehyde. Samples were blinded and run on a 
LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) at the University of Rochester.
For intracellular cytokine (IL-10 and TGFβ) evaluations, cells were 
divided into 2 samples and cultured in complete media (RPMI supple￾mented with 20% BSA) with brefeldin (1 μl/ml) and monensin (2 μM) in 
the presence or absence of stimulation (500 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml 
ionomycin) for 5 hours. After culture, cells were washed with FACS Buf￾fer (PBS plus 0.5% BSA) 2× and then surface stained with extracellular 
antibody cocktail for 30 minutes at 4°C. Cells were then washed 2×
with PBS and stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain 
Kit (catalog no. L34957; Invitrogen) at 1:1,000 in PBS for 30 minutes at 
4°C. Cells were then washed 2× with FACS buffer and then fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C. Cells 
were subsequently permeabilized with Perm/Wash Buffer (catalog no. 
554723; BD) for 30 minutes at 4°C. Cells with then intracellularly stained 
in Perm/Wash buffer with the ICS antibody cocktail for 1 hour at 4°C. 
Finally, cells were washed 2× with Perm/Wash buffer and resuspended in 
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS until analysis on the LSR II Flow Cytometer 
(BD) and with Flow Jo Software (Tree Star Inc.)
Microarray. Total RNA was obtained using the ABI Tempus whole blood 
collection system (Applied Biosystem) and frozen for future processing. 
Total RNA was purified using previously described methods (34). Targets 
from blinded RNA samples were prepared and hybridized to Affymetrix 
HG-U133 2.0 Plus GeneChip using the GeneChip Expression Analysis 
Technical Manual, with modifications described by Expression Analysis 
Inc. (50). Primary gene-expression profiling data are available from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus of the National Center for Biotechnology Infor￾mation (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
MassARRAY quantitative gene expression. Multiplexed primer and com￾petitive template designs were created using the MassARRAY quantitative 
gene expression (MassARRAY QGE) Assay Design software (version 1.0; 
Sequenom) for random hexamer priming, such that at least 1 PCR primer 
spanned an exonic boundary per transcript assayed. The 228 genes tested 
were assayed in a series of 20-plex reactions on RNA from blinded samples 
and are shown in Supplemental Table 2. Copy gene number determination 
was conducted as described previously (34).
Statistics. Microarray data background adjustment, normalization, and 
summarization were performed using the robust multichip average meth￾od. Microarray quality assurance was carried out by detecting outlier arrays 
based on standard posthybridization quality metrics (51). A linear mixed 
effect model was used for correcting potential processing batch effect as 
well as for estimating clinical group effect. Pairwise comparisons were per￾formed with Tukey adjustment for group-level multiple comparisons, to 
identify differentially expressed genes between different clinical groups. 
The Benjamini and Hochberg approach for control of FDR was adopted 
for genewise multiple testing adjustments (52). Statistical criteria for iden￾tification of differentially expressed genes were FDR-adjusted P < 0.05 and 
fold change greater than 1.5.
Urine RT-PCR data was normalized against 18S-rRNA; peripheral blood 
MassARRAY QGE was normalized against a set of 5 stable housekeeping 
genes. For urine RT-PCR, peripheral blood MassARRAY QGE, and flow 
cytometry data, a Shapiro-Wilk test was adopted to check whether data

came from a normally distributed population. Although a log2 data trans￾formation substantially reduced extent of deviation from the normal dis￾tribution, logarithm-transformed data of a substantial number of genes 
or cell populations still deviated from the normal distribution. Hence, 
a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was conducted on a per-gene 
basis for pairwise comparisons between the clinical groups. Gene- or cell 
population–wise multiple testing adjustments were performed using the 
FDR method of Benjamini and Hochberg (52). A statistical criterion for 
identification of differentially expressed genes or cell populations was 
FDR-adjusted P < 0.05. Hierarchical clustering images for microarray and 
MassARRAY QGE data were generated based on Pearson correlation using 
GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 (Agilent). Box plot images were generated using 
S-Plus (TIBCO). Classification approaches were applied to MassARRAY 
QGE and flow cytometry on frozen cells using log2 transformed data. In 
all instances, variable selection was performed using 1-way ANOVA test￾ing TOL versus SI with multiple groups of variables ranging in size from 
1 to 10 with a step of 1. LDA with equal prior probabilities using LOOCV 
was the most effective classification approach for MassARRAY QGE using 
3 candidate genes (53). The model was constructed using a training set of 
19 TOL and 24 SI samples and then applied to an ITN test set of 6 TOL and 
6 SI samples collected and processed after November 2007.
The normalized, log2-transformed expression levels for the 3 genes 
IGKV1D-13, IGKV4-1, and IGLL1 were used to generate a probability score 
between 0 and 1 for each participant’s membership in the TOL group using 
Equation 1, in which βi is the coefficient in the table, and Gi is the expres￾sion level for each gene. 
 (Equation 1)
Classification was based on the posterior probabilities with a 0.5 cutoff; 
thus, participants with a score of 0.5 or higher would be assigned to the 
TOL group. LOOCV was applied to determine how accurately the learning 
algorithm predicted data that it was not trained on. In using this approach, 
the LDA model was trained multiple times, using all but 1 of the train￾ing set data points. The sample that was removed was retested iteratively 
to generate the best PPV and NPV during training. Feature selection was 
embedded within the LOOCV process.
Support vector machine (SVM) was the most effective for flow cytom￾etry data in determining 1 population to have the best PPV. The SVM 
model was configured with cost-based shrinking from 1 to 1,001 with step 
100 and tolerance from 0.001. The kernel used a radial basis function (γ) 
set at 1/no. variables and LOOCV (54). The model was constructed using 
23 ITN TOL and 31 ITN SI samples and applied to the test set of Euro￾pean IOT group samples consisting of 6 TOL and 12 SI samples. Partek 
Genomics Suite (version 6.4; Partek) was used for prediction approaches 
that allowed us to test over 1,000 models using various feature combina￾tions and SVM permutations.
