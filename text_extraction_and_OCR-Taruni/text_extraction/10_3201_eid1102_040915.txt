Mycotic Brain
Abscess Caused by
Opportunistic
Reptile Pathogen 
To the Editor: A 38-year-old,
HIV-seropositive Nigerian man
sought treatment with an 8-month his￾tory of severe parietal headache,
impaired memory, fatigue, paresthesia
of the left arm, and left-sided focal
seizures. He had no history of neuro￾logic disorders, including epilepsy.
On physical examination, the patient
appeared well, alert, and oriented,
with slurred speech. Evaluation of the
visual fields showed left homony￾mous hemianopsia. All other neuro￾logic assessments were unremarkable.
The patient had a blood pressure of
120/80, a pulse of 88 beats per
minute, and a body temperature of
37.3°C. Leukocyte count was
8,600/µL, total lymphocyte count was
1,981/µL, CD4+ cell count was
102/µL, and CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.07.
HIV RNA-load was <50 copies/mL;
all other laboratory parameters were
normal. The patient had received anti￾retroviral therapy (stavudine, lamivu￾dine, nevirapine) for 5 months before
admission, but no prophylaxis for
opportunistic infections. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain
disclosed 2 masses, 3.3 and 4.8 cm in
diameter, respectively (Figure A), and
signs of chronic sinusitis. A computed
tomographic chest scan showed infil￾tration of both lower segments with
multiple, small nodules (Figure B).
Blood cultures were repeatedly nega￾tive. A computer-guided needle￾aspiration of the brain lesions yielded
yellow-brown, creamy fluid in which
abundant septated fungal hyphae were
detected microscopically (Figure C).
Cytologic investigation was consis￾tent with a necrotic abscess. The
cycloheximide-resistant isolate was
strongly keratinolytic and identified
as a Chrysosporium anamorph of
Nannizziopsis vriesii (1,2). High-dose
antimicrobial treatment with
voriconazole (200 mg twice daily,
subsequently reduced to 200 mg
daily) was added to the antiretroviral
(ritonavir, amprenavir, trizivir), anti￾convulsive, and adjuvant corticos￾teroid treatment. The isolate was
highly susceptible to voriconazole in
vitro (MIC, <16µg/mL [Etest, AB￾Biodisk Solna, Sweden]). Recovery
was complicated by a generalized
seizure and severe, acute psychosis
associated with rapid refilling of the 2
lesions with mycotic abscess fluid.
After re-aspiration, the patient’s psy￾chosis improved gradually, and no
further seizures occurred. When last
seen 4 months later, the patient was
healthy and without neurologic
deficits. His CD4+ cell count was
233/µL, HIV-load was <50
copies/mL, and a MRI scan of the
brain showed partial regression of the
2 brain lesions (Figure D). 
Chrysosporium spp. are common
soil saprobes, occasionally isolated
from human skin. Invasive infection
is very rare in humans, and most were
observed in immunocompromised
patients, manifesting as osteomyelitis
(3,4) or diffuse vascular brain inva￾sion (5). Here, we report the first case
of brain abscesses by the
Chrysosporium anamorph of N.
vriesii. This fungus has been associat￾ed with fatal mycosis in reptiles (6,7)
and cutaneous mycosis in chameleons
originating from Africa (2). 
In our patient, we were unable to
determine the portal of entry and the
sequence of fungal dissemination; no

skin lesions were present at the time
of admission. However, the multifocal
nature, lung infiltration, and involve￾ment of the middle cerebral artery dis￾tribution suggest hematogenous dis￾semination (8,9) after replication of
airborne conidia within the respirato￾ry tract. 
Fungi cause >90% of brain
abscesses in immunocompromised
transplant patients with an associated
mortality rate of 97% (10), despite
aggressive surgery and antifungal
therapy (9). Our patient was treated
successfully with abscess drainage,
antiretroviral therapy, and oral
voriconazole, a novel antifungal tria￾zole drug. Despite limited data avail￾able on voriconazole penetration into
brain abscess cavities (9), this drug
was clinically and radiologically
effective in our patient.

We thank the patient for cooperating
with our investigation, Pfizer Germany for
providing voriconazole, and Heidemarie
Losert and Elisabeth Antweiler for their
excellent technical assistance.
