Abstract
Background: Extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDR-Ab) has emerged as a major nosocomial pathogen,
but optimal treatment regimens are unknown. Although solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are particularly susceptible
to XDR-Ab infections, studies in this population are limited. Our objectives were to determine the epidemiology, clinical
characteristics and outcomes of XDR-Ab infections among SOT patients.
Methods: A retrospective study of SOT recipients at our center who were colonized or infected with XDR-Ab between
November 2006 and December 2011 was conducted. Among infected patients, the primary outcome was survival at 28
days. Secondary outcomes included survival at 90 days and clinical success at 28 days, and XDR-Ab infection recurrence.
Results: XDR-Ab was isolated from 69 SOT patients, of whom 41% (28) and 59% (41) were colonized and infected,
respectively. Infections were significantly more common among cardiothoracic than abdominal transplant recipients
(p = 0.0004). Ninety-eight percent (40/41) of patients had respiratory tract infections, most commonly ventilator-associated
pneumonia (VAP; 88% [36/41]). Survival rates at 28 and 90 days were 54% (22/41) and 46% (19/41), respectively. Treatment
with a colistin-carbapenem regimen was an independent predictor of 28-day survival (p = 0.01; odds ratio = 7.88 [95% CI:
1.60–38.76]). Clinical success at 28 days was achieved in 49% (18/37) of patients who received antimicrobial therapy, but
44% (8/18) of successes were associated with infection recurrence within 3 months. Colistin resistance emerged in 18% (2/
11) and 100% (3/3) of patients treated with colistin-carbapenem and colistin-tigecycline, respectively (p = 0.03).
Conclusions: XDR-Ab causes VAP and other respiratory infections following SOT that are associated with significant
recurrence and mortality rates. Cardiothoracic transplant recipients are at greatest risk. Results from this retrospective study
suggest that colistin-carbapenem combinations may result in improved clinical responses and survival compared to other
regimens and may also limit the emergence of colistin resistance.

Introduction
Bacteria cause most infections following solid organ trans￾plantation (SOT) and bacterial infections are a leading cause of
death across transplant types [1,2]. Infections due to bacteria that
are resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents pose an increasing
threat to SOT recipients and other hospitalized patients [3,4].
Indeed, SOT recipients are highly susceptible to the acquisition or
development of drug-resistant bacterial infections due to their
frequent and prolonged hospitalizations, receipt of broad-spec￾trum antibiotics, multiple surgeries and concomitant immunosu￾pression [5]. Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged in recent years as
a particularly problematic drug-resistant pathogen [6,7], but it has
been rarely studied among SOT patients [4,5,8,9].
A. baumannii is a resilient opportunistic pathogen that is
notorious for persisting in the hospital environment. It is
intrinsically resistant to some beta-lactam antibiotics, but is better
known for its ability to acquire resistance to all commercially
available antimicrobial agents [10]. In fact, carbapenem-resistant
A. baumannii has been identified as one of the six ‘‘ESKAPE’’
pathogens responsible for an increasing number of nosocomial
infections in the United States [3]. Carbapenem-resistant A.
baumannii isolates are almost always extensively drug-resistant
(XDR), which is defined by resistance to all antimicrobial agents
except polymixins (colistin) and tigecyline [11]. The treatment of

XDR-A. baumannii (XDR-Ab) infections is a major challenge given
the lack of effective treatment options and limited management
experience. Unfortunately, increased use of colistin and tigecycline
as salvage therapy has been associated with the emergence of pan￾drug resistant (PDR)-Ab, against which no known antimicrobial
agents retain activity [11].
In the SOT program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center (UPMC), we cared for several patients with serious XDR￾Ab infections who failed to respond to various combinations of
antibiotics that included colistin and/or tigecycline. In a pilot
study initiated in 2009, our Antimicrobial Management and
Transplant Infectious Diseases (AMP and TID) programs collab￾orated to devise an institution-specific treatment regimen for
XDR-Ab infections [4]. We used a variety of methods to test
XDR-Ab isolates recovered from our patients for in vitro suscep￾tibility to antimicrobial combinations. On the basis of our results,
we recommended that the combination of colistin and a carbape￾nem be adopted as standard therapy for XDR-Ab infections
among SOT patients at our center. We reported encouraging
short-term clinical success and survival rates among five SOT
recipients treated with this regimen [4]. To our knowledge, this
was the first study to assess the efficacy of a colistin-carbapenem
combination regimen in the treatment of XDR-Ab infections.
The present study is a follow-up to our preliminary report, in
which we describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics s and
long-term outcomes of SOT recipients with XDR-Ab infections. In
so doing, we report survival, treatment responses and the
emergence of colistin resistance among patients treated with
colistin-carbapenem and other regimens.
Methods
Ethics Statement
The protocol was reviewed by the University of Pittsburgh
Institutional Review Board (IRB) and determined to meet the
necessary criteria for exemption under section 45 of the Code of
Federal Regulations. Per local policies and through consultation
with the IRB, written patient consent was not required and formal
ethical approval was reviewed and waived.
Patient Population and Definitions
We conducted a retrospective study of all 69 SOT recipients at
UPMC who were colonized or infected with XDR- or PDR-Ab
between November 2006 and December 2011. Sixteen of these 69
patients were included in our earlier study that identified the
combination of a carbapenem and colistin as the most active
regimen against XDR-Ab isolates from our center [4]. XDR and
PDR-Ab was defined according to consensus recommendations
[11]. All patients were evaluated and managed by our TID service
as part of routine patient care. Classifications of colonization or
infection (disease caused by Ab) were made by the treating TID
physician and independently confirmed by two investigators
according to consensus criteria [12]. Patients with clinical evidence
of infection were classified as having pneumonia [ventilator￾associated (VAP) or healthcare-associated (HAP)], tracheobron￾chitis [ventilator-associated (VAT)] or bacteremia [13].
Patient Outcomes
The primary outcome of our analysis was survival at 28 days
following the onset of XDR-Ab infection. Twenty-eight rather than
14 day survival was used because many patients remained on
antimicrobial therapy at the 14 day endpoint. Moreover, the 28
day endpoint allowed for a more reasonable definition of recurrent
infection (see below). Secondary outcomes included survival at 90
days and in-hospital. Persistent XDR-Ab infection at the time of
death was defined as a positive culture on autopsy or within 7 days
of death. Clinical success was evaluated at 28 days from the onset
of infection and defined as the improvement or resolution in signs
and symptoms of infection [4]. Patients with clinical success at 28
days who manifested new signs and symptoms of infection due to
XDR-Ab within the following 3 months were classified as having
recurrent infections.
Colistin Susceptibility Testing
Colistin susceptibility testing was performed by our clinical
microbiology laboratory by broth dilution methods at the request
of the treating physician [14]. Susceptible isolates were defined by
a colistin MIC#2 mg/mL.
Statistical Analysis
Comparisons between two groups were performed by Wilcoxon
rank sum test for continuous variables and Chi-squared or Fisher’s
exact tests for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression
analysis was performed by backward selection procedures. We
included variables identified (p-value,0.20) by univariate analy￾ses. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare survival
between treatment groups. Significance was defined as p￾value#0.05 (two-tailed).
Results
XDR-A. baumannii (XDR-Ab) Colonization and Infections
XDR-Ab was isolated from 69 patients following lung (36%; 25/
69), liver (25%; 17/69), kidney (17%; 12/69), heart (9%; 6/69),
multivisceral (6%; 4/69), intestine (4%; 3/69) or pancreas (3%; 2/
69) transplantation. Forty-one percent (28/69) and 59% (41/69) of
patients were colonized and infected, respectively. Rates of
colonization and infection by transplant type are presented in
Table 1. XDR-Ab infections were more common among
cardiothoracic transplant (heart and lung) than abdominal trans￾plant (intestine, kidney, liver, multivisceral, and pancreas)
recipients (2.6% [24/901] vs. 0.9% [17/1971]; p = 0.0004).
Median times to colonization and infection post-transplant were
121 and 172 days, respectively (ranges: 0–2795 and 0–6829 days,
respectively; p = 0.82). The sites of colonization were the re￾spiratory tract (53%; 15/28), urine (36%; 10/28), and wounds
(11%; 3/28). In contrast, the respiratory tract was the site of XDR￾Ab infection in 98% (40/41) of patients.
Demographics and Clinical Characteristics of Patients
with XDR-Ab Infections
Thirty-two percent (13/41) of patients with an XDR-Ab
infection were previously colonized. Infected patients were
critically-ill at the time of diagnosis, as evident by APACHE II
scores and high rates of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation
(Table 2). Ninety percent (37/41) and 7% (3/41) of infected
patients had pneumonia (VAP = 36 and HAP = 1) and VAT,
respectively. The only patient who did not have a respiratory tract
infection had primary bacteremia. Twenty-five percent (9/36) of
VAP was complicated by associated infections, including second￾ary bacteremia (n = 5), mediastinitis (n = 2), and empyema (n = 2).
Bacterial co-pathogens were identified in 44% (18/41) of patients,
including carbapenem-resistant co-pathogens in 10% (4/41).
The 28 day survival rate among infected patients was 54% (22/
41). The 90 day and in-hospital survival rates were 46% (19/41)
and 39% (16/41), respectively. Among patients who died in￾hospital, 68% (17/25) had persistent XDR-Ab infection at the time
of death.

Patient Outcomes by Treatment Regimen
Ten percent (4/41) of infected patients died prior to the
institution of antimicrobial therapy. Among the remaining 90%
(37/41) of patients who were treated with antimicrobials against
XDR-Ab, the clinical success rate at 28 days was 49% (18/37).
Clinical success rates for specific antimicrobial regimens are
summarized in Figures 1 and 2. Eleven percent (4/37) and 89%
(33/37) of patients received mono- and combination therapy,
respectively. The median durations of mono- and combination
therapy were 6.5 (range: 5–8) and 15 (range: 3–52) days,
respectively (p = 0.13). Clinical success was not achieved for any
patients receiving monotherapy (0/4). Ninety-seven percent (32/
33) of combination regimens were colistin-based and 60% (21/32)
of colistin-based combinations included a carbapenem (doripe￾nem, n = 19, and meropenem, n =2; Figures 1 and 2). Clinical
characteristics of patients receiving colistin and carbapenem
combination therapy were similar to patients treated with other
regimens (Table 3). Rates of clinical success at 28 days were
significantly higher when colistin was combined with a carbapenem
(76%; 16/21) versus other agents (9% [1/11]; p = 0.0005, Figure 2).
None of the 7 patients receiving colistin and tigecycline
experienced clinical success. Clinical success at 28 days was
similar for patients who received inhaled colistin as an adjunct to
combination therapy (57%; 8/14) versus those who did not (50%;
9/18) (p = 0.73).
Forty-four percent (8/18) of patients with clinical success at 28
days had recurrent infections. The initial infections in these
patients were VAP (n = 7) and VAT (n = 1). All patients with
recurrent infections initially received colistin-carbapenem combi￾nation therapy for a median duration of 14 days (range: 5–28).
The recurrent disease manifestations were VAP (n = 7) and
bacteremia (n = 1). Twenty-eight percent (5/18) of patients with
clinical success at 28 days had multiple recurrences. Patients with
recurrent infections were more likely to be colonized with XDR-Ab
prior to the onset of infection and had significantly longer hospital
stays compared to patients with no recurrences (p = 0.04 and 0.02,
respectively; Table 4). In all instances, recurrent infections were re￾treated with colistin-carbapenem combinations. Ultimately, clin￾ical success was achieved in 75% (6/8) of patients (Table 5).
Ampicillin/sulbactam was added to the colistin-carbapenem
regimen in 50% (3/6) of successfully-treated recurrent infections.
The 28 day survival rate for patients treated with antimicrobials
was 59% (22/37). None of the patients (0/4) who were treated
with antimicrobial monotherapy survived for 28 days, compared
to 66% (22/33) of patients receiving combination therapy
(p = 0.03). The 90 day and in-hospital survival rates for the latter
patients were 62% (23/37) and 49% (18/37), respectively.
Colistin-carbapenem regimens were associated with significantly
higher 28 and 90 day survival compared to other regimens
(p = 0.009 and 0.0008, respectively; Table 6, Figures 3a, 3b).
Moreover, colistin-carbapenem regimens were independently
associated with 28 day survival by multivariate logistic regression
(Table 7; p =0.01, Odds ratio = 7.88 [95% CI: 1.60–38.76]).
Long-term survival at 90 days was significantly higher for patients
who had clinical success at 28 days (95% [18/19]) compared to
those without clinical success (6% [1/18], p,0.0001).
Emergence of Colistin Resistance
Colistin MICs were determined against 88% (28/32) of XDR￾Ab isolates recovered from patients at the time of initial treatment
with a colistin-containing regimen. The median colistin MIC was
0.5 mg/mL (range: 0.125–8 mg/mL); 4% (1/28) of patients were
infected with a colistin-resistant isolate (MIC = 8 mg/mL; PDR￾Ab). There were no differences in median colistin MICs among
patients who survived or died at 28 days (0.25 mg/mL (range:

0.125–2 mg/mL) vs. 0.125 mg/mL (range: 0.125–8 mg/mL);
p = 0.15). Isolates were available for repeat susceptibility testing
in 50% (14/28) of patients at a median of 46 days (range: 7–124
days) after the initial MIC was measured. Colistin resistance
emerged in 36% (5/14; Tables 8 and 9). There were no differences
in the duration of inhaled (p = 0.19) or intravenous (p = 0.24)
colistin therapy among patients who did and did not develop
resistance. One hundred percent (3/3) of isolates collected from
patients who received colistin-tigecycline combinations developed
resistance compared to 18% (2/11) of isolates from patients who
received colistin and a carbapenem (p= 0.03).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the largest study describing the
epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of XDR-Ab
infections among SOT recipients. Over a five year period, we
identified 41 SOT patients who developed invasive XDR-Ab
infections. Among 37 patients treated with antimicrobial regimens
against XDR-Ab, the rates of clinical success and survival at 28
days were 49% (18/37) and 57% (21/37), respectively. The major
finding of this study was the improved outcomes among patients
treated with colistin-carbapenem combination therapy compared

to other therapeutic regimens. In fact, clinical success and survival
at 28 days was achieved in 76% (16/21) and 81% (17/21) of
patients receiving colistin and a carbapenem compared to 13% (2/
16) and 31% (5/16), respectively, for patients who received other
regimens. Treatment with a colistin-carbapenem regimen was an
independent predictor of 28-day survival. Colistin-carbapenem
therapy also limited the emergence of colistin resistance when
compared to treatment with colistin-tigecycline. Taken together,
our results corroborate and extend those of an earlier pilot study,
in which we reported 28 day clinical success rates of 80% (4/5)
and 9% (1/11) among SOT patients who received colistin￾carbapenem or other regimens, respectively, for the treatment of
XDR-Ab [4].
These data are particularly important given the lack of
therapeutic options against XDR-Ab infections. By definition,
XDR-Ab isolates are resistant to all conventional antimicrobial
agents. Moreover, treatment of patients with potential salvage
agents such as tigecycline and colistin has been associated with
poor clinical outcomes including death, breakthrough infections,
and the emergence of PDR-Ab infections [15,16,17]. As a result of
the dismal experience to date, investigators and clinicians have
explored a variety of drug combinations in the laboratory and
clinic. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated positive
in vitro interactions between various combinations of carbapenems,
colistin, rifampin, sulbactam, and tigecycline against XDR-Ab
isolates [18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. Never￾theless, clinical studies validating in vitro findings are limited. Most
experience in patients has been reported for combination therapy
with colistin plus rifampin [33,34], a carbapenem [4,35,36] or
tigecycline [37], but clinical success rates are highly variable and
long-term outcomes of patients are unknown. In this regard, our
study is unique not only for its size and the high rates of clinical
success achieved with colistin-carbapenem combination therapy,
but also for the insights it provides into long term outcomes such as
the development of colistin resistance and XDR-Ab disease
recurrence. In fact, all surviving patients in our study were
followed for a minimum of 6 months from the onset of XDR-Ab
infection, an observation period that was largely made possible by
prolonged survival achieved with colistin-carbapenem combina￾tions.
To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that the
use of colistin-carbapenem combination therapy in a clinical
setting may limit the emergence of colistin resistance. Our data for
serial XDR-Ab isolates recovered from patients treated with
colistin-containing combinations are consistent with prior in vitro
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of colistin and
doripenem against K. pneumoniae isolates [38]. It is increasingly
clear that colistin monotherapy is untenable due to the frequent
emergence of colistin resistance among Acinetobacter isolates, which
correlates with therapeutic failures and stems from point mutations

dual benefit of improving clinical outcomes among patients with
XDR-Ab infections and suppressing the emergence of further drug
resistance. The use of multiple antimicrobials to limit drug
resistance has long been cited as a rationale for employing
combination regimens to treat infectious diseases. Clinical data
validating this strategy are well-established for infections caused by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis [40] and human immunodeficiency virus
[41,42,43], but evidence during the treatment of infections by
Gram negative bacteria are limited [44].
Despite the improved outcomes we observed among patients
treated with colistin-carbapenem, it is important to acknowledge
that clinical responses were still suboptimal. Indeed, 50% (8/16) of
patients who were successfully treated with the regimen at 28 days
subsequently had recurrent XDR-Ab infections, including 31% (5/
16) who suffered multiple recurrences. Therefore, initial colistin￾carbapenem regimens were associated with long-term cures,
recurrent infections and clinical failure in 38% (8/21), 38% (8/
21) and 24% (5/21) of patients, respectively. Fortunately, 75% (6/
8) of patients with recurrent infections were ultimately cured with
repeated colistin-carbapenem regimens, often including the
addition of sulbactam. While the long-term outcomes were
encouraging, the treatment of recurrent infections resulted in
significantly longer hospital stays. Due to the lack of sufficient
follow-up, our pilot study and other reports of patient outcomes
did not assess recurrent XDR-Ab infections [4,33,34,35,36,37].
Our long-term experience is not surprising, as persistence of
Acinetobacter is well-recognized, especially among immune compro￾mised individuals [8]. In one report, for example, Ab was
repeatedly recovered from respiratory cultures in 67% of trans￾plant recipients compared to only 7% of non-transplant patients
(p = 0.005) [8]. The ability of Ab to persist within human hosts is
likely multi-factorial. Of course, the ease with which Ab acquires
a wide variety of drug resistance mechanisms facilitates survival
despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the organism
is particularly well-adapted to adhere to human epithelial cells and
withstand adverse environmental conditions due to its innate
resistance to desiccation and disinfectants [45–46]. Indeed, Ab
forms biofilms on human cells and abiotic surfaces, such as glass or
plastic, allowing it to survive for months in the face of dry
conditions or nutrient starvation [46]. As such, it is unlikely that
any treatment regimen will completely eliminate recurrent XDR￾Ab infections, and preventive strategies, in particular scrupulous
infection control measures and judicious use of antibiotics, are
crucial to improving patient outcomes [47].
The importance of prevention is highlighted by our findings that
29% of infected patients were known to be colonized previously
with XDR-Ab and recurrent infections were more common among
colonized patients. The overall colonization and infection rates
among almost 3,000 SOT recipients were 0.9% and 1.4%,
respectively. Interestingly, colonization rates were similar for all
types of transplant, but invasive infections were more likely among
cardiothoracic transplant recipients. XDR-Ab almost exclusively
caused respiratory infections in our study, consistent with previous
reports among SOT patients [5,8]. The vast majority of infections
were VAP, in keeping with the fact that 98% of patients were in
the ICU and intubated at the onset of infection. Ab utilizes short,
fimbrial-like protrusions on the bacterial cell surface to attach with
great avidity to bronchial epithelial cells [48,49]. Lung transplant
recipients, in particular, are predisposed to respiratory tract
infections by Ab and other pathogens because of their need for
prolonged ventilation [50], impaired mucociliary clearance [51],

and profound immune suppression [52]. Given the severity of
pneumonia among immune comprised hosts, it is not surprising
that 61% of our patients died in the hospital, the majority with
ongoing XDR-Ab infections. Mortality rates of Ab infections
among SOT recipients in other reports have ranged from 50–80%
[5,8,9], which exceed those in non-transplant patients with similar
diseases and for VAP due to other pathogens [16,53,54].
There are several limitations to our study, including the fact that
it is a single center experience that may not be representative of
other institutions. As for all retrospective studies, data were limited
to existing medical records and information such as prior
antimicrobial therapy was not necessarily available for all patients.
Our retrospective study design is subject to selection bias and
management decisions for patients were uncontrolled. As such, we
cannot draw definitive conclusions when comparing treatment
regimens. Nevertheless, the underlying diseases, clinical parame￾ters and adjunctive therapies for patients receiving colistin/
carbapenem combinations were similar to patients treated with
other agents. The odds ratio for 28 day survival among patients
receiving colistin/carbapenem regimens was highly significant
(OR = 7.88, p = 0.01), but the associated confidence interval was
wide due to our relatively small sample sizes. All patients were
managed by the TID and AMP teams, but antimicrobial dosing
was not standardized during the study period, and doripenem and
colistin MICs were not requested for all isolates. Of note,
doripenem was used as the preferred carbapenem at our center,
but in vitro data from our lab and others suggest that other anti￾pseudomonal carbapenems may be equally efficacious [4,31,55].
The colistin-carbapenem regimen was initially recommended as
frontline therapy against XDR-Ab at our center based on in vitro
data from our AMP lab. Due to the poor outcomes we had
observed among XDR-Ab-infected patients, we systematically
tested isolates from our patients in our pilot study for susceptibility
to various antimicrobial combinations using time-kill assays and
other methods. Colistin-carbapenem was identified as the most
promising combination because it commonly showed positive
interactions in vitro and colistin MICs against baseline patient
isolates were generally in the susceptible range. In this regard, the
present study suggests a model by which centers may employ local
susceptibility and combination testing data to identify or

corroborate optimal treatment regimens against resistant patho￾gens. Given the well-recognized heterogeneity of Ab isolates from
different centers and geographic locations [25,47,56], it is
important to recognize that the most effective treatment regimens
may vary. In assessing our experience, it is also important to
consider that our studies were conducted among SOT recipients,
a patient population that is generally excluded from clinical trials
of antimicrobial therapy. In fact, we propose that SOT and other
immune-compromised patients may represent promising popula￾tions for studying the treatment of resistant bacterial infections, as
they are particularly dependent upon antimicrobial efficacy for
positive clinical outcomes. In these patients, antimicrobial effects
are likely to be most relevant for serious infections such as VAP,
which are associated with very high microbial burdens.
