Abstract
Background and Aims: MicroRNAs are small endogenous RNA molecules with specific expression patterns that can serve as
biomarkers for numerous diseases. However, little is known about the expression profile of serum miRNAs in PBC.
Methods: First, we employed Illumina deep sequencing for the initial screening to indicate the read numbers of miRNA
expression in 10 PBC, 5 CH-C, 5 CH-B patients and 5 healthy controls. Comparing the differentially expressed miRNAs in the
4 groups, analysis of variance was performed on the number of sequence reads to evaluate the statistical significance.
Hierarchical clustering was performed using an R platform and we have found candidates for specific miRNAs in the PBC
patients. Second, a quantitative reverse transcription PCR validation study was conducted in 10 samples in each group. The
expression levels of the selected miRNAs were presented as fold-changes (22DDCt). Finally, computer analysis was
conducted to predict target genes and biological functions with MiRror 2.0 and DAVID v6.7.
Results: We obtained about 12 million 32-mer short RNA reads on average per sample and the mapping rates to miRBase
were 16.60% and 81.66% to hg19. In the statistical significance testing, the expression levels of 81 miRNAs were found to be
differentially expressed in the 4 groups. The heat map and hierarchical clustering demonstrated that the miRNA profiles
from PBC clustered with those of CH-B, CH-C and healthy controls. Additionally, the circulating levels of hsa-miR-505-3p,
197-3p, and 500a-3p were significantly decreased in PBC compared with healthy controls and the expression levels of hsa￾miR-505-3p, 139-5p and 197-3p were significantly reduced compared with the viral hepatitis group.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that sera from patients with PBC have a unique miRNA expression profile and that the
down-regulated expression of hsa-miR-505-3p and miR-197-3p can serve as clinical biomarkers of PBC.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNA molecules of
19 to 24 nucleotides that control the translation and transcription
of targeting mRNAs by base-pairing to the complementary sites
[1] [2] [3] [4]. The expression of miRNAs in serum is reported to
be stable, reproducible and consistent among individuals of the
same species [5]. So far, specific expression patterns of serum
miRNAs were identified as a fingerprint for numerous diseases and
cancers [6] [5]. The serum miR-122 levels are elevated in patients
with liver damage due to chronic hepatitis B (CH-B) and C
infection (CH-C) [7] [8]. In addition, the miR-122 and miR-34a
levels are positively correlated with the disease severity in CH-C
and non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease [9]. However, there are some
reports that miR-122 expression in healthy controls was signifi￾cantly higher than that in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection [10]. Li et. al. described that 13 miRNAs were
differentially expressed in hepatitis B virus (HBV) serum and that
miR-25, miR-375 and let-7f could be used as biomarkers to
separate a HBV-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) group
from HBV-negative HCC [11]. However, little is known about the
expression profile of miRNAs in autoimmune disease such as
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
PBC is female predominant, progressive autoimmune disease
characterized by immune-mediated destruction of the intrahepatic
bile ducts. The serological marker of PBC is the presence of anti￾mitochondrial antibody (AMA) directed against the E2 subunit of
the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complexes located in the
inner mitochondrial membrane [12] [13] [14]. The etiology of
PBC is considered to be a combination of genetic predisposition
and environmental triggers [15]. Particularly, concerning genetic
predisposition, previous studies reported that common genetic
variants at the HLA class II, IL12A, IL12RB2, STAT4, IRF5-

TNPO3 and IKZF3 had significant associations [16] [17] [18]
[19] [20] [21]. Recently, genome-wide association study in
Japanese population showed TNFSF15 and POU2AF1 as
susceptibility loci [22]. Several GWAS data suggested the
important contributions of several immune pathways to the
development of PBC. However, the results have differed among
the study groups [21]. The diagnosis of PBC is established based
on the following criteria: (1) biochemical evidence of cholestasis; (2)
the presence of AMA; and (3) histopathologic evidence of
nonsuppurative cholangitis and destruction of the interlobular
bile ducts [23]. Though diagnostic criteria have been determined,
the eventual progression to biochemically and clinically apparent
disease is unpredictable. Many patients are recognized at an
earlier stage of disease and respond well to medical therapy, while
some patients will require liver transplantation [24] [25]. To
revolutionize the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of PBC, new
biomarkers seem to be feasible, and miRNAs are emerging as
highly tissue-specific biomarkers with potential clinical applicabil￾ity [26] [6].
In this study, we employed a strategy of using Illumina small￾RNA sequencing for the initial screening followed by quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) validation to analyze serum
samples, which were arranged in multiple trial and testing sets.
Additionally, computer analysis was conducted to predict target
genes and biological functions from the differentially expressed
miRNAs in PBC. The results demonstrate that the unique
expression pattern of serum miRNAs can serve as a noninvasive
biomarker for the diagnosis of PBC.
Results
Global analysis of miRNAs by deep sequencing
Circulating miRNAs were detected from human serum in 10
patients diagnosed with PBC and 15 non-PBC subjects with CH￾B, CH-C and healthy controls, using Illumina GA IIx sequencing.
Detailed clinical information is shown in table 1. We analyzed
three samples by single-end deep sequencing on one lane and
obtained about 12 million 32-mer short RNA reads on average per
sample. After trimming the reads to exclude adaptor and tag
sequences by using cutadapt, 9,245,752 high-quality reads per
sample were subjected to analysis [27]. The mapping rates to
miRBase were 16.60% on average and those to hg19 were 81.66%
(Table 2).
miRNA expression profile in serum affected of PBC
We normalized the differential expression of miRNA count data
using the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalization
process and the number of individual miRNA reads was
standardized by the total numbers of 1,000,000 reads in each
sample [28]. Comparing the 4 groups (PBC, CH-C, CH-B and
healthy control), the differential expression levels of miRNA were
extracted using analysis of variance (ANOVA). 1594 miRNAs
were detected by deep sequencing (Table S1). Due to the small
number of miRNA detections, the statistical significance of 821
miRNAs could not be determined. The ANOVA was used to
determine differentially expressed miRNAs and multiple compar￾isons procedure was applied to compare more than one pair of
means at the same time. Therefore, in statistical significance
testing in the remaining 773 miRNAs, the p-value by multiple
comparisons was performed by calculating False discovery rate
(FDR),0.1. The expression levels of 81 miRNAs were found to be
differentially expressed in the 4 groups. Although, several types of
clinical data were shown to be different from PBC, M2 negative
for PBC-8, ANA positive for PBC-10 or past HBV infection for
PBC-6, the histologies of all samples were characterized by PBC of
chronic, nonsuppurative cholangitis affecting the interlobular and
septal ducts. The heat map and hierarchical clustering demon￾strated that the miRNA profiles from PBC clustered with those of
CH-B, CH-C and healthy controls (Figure 1). Of note, CH-B and
healthy controls were not clearly distinguished.
In the result of Illumina sequencing, 3 miRNAs were up￾regulated (.2-fold) in PBC patients, with hsa-miR-1273g-5p being
most enriched. The relative levels of 6 dysregulated miRNAs were
down-regulated (,0.5-fold), with hsa-miR-766-5p being the
smallest (Table 3).
miRNA validation study
We used qRT-PCR to verify the data obtained from the
Illumina sequencing. The relative expression levels from 9
differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed with the TaqMan
MicroRNA assay (Applied Biosystems) or miRCURY LNA
microRNA PCR system (Exiqon). In addition to the 25 samples
used for Illumina deep sequencing, 10 cases of miRNA expression
in PBC, CH-C, CH-B and healthy controls were quantified
(Table 4). The expression levels of selected miRNAs detected by
qRT-PCR were normalized to spiked-in cel-miR-39 and present￾ed as fold-changes (22DDCt) above those of the CH-C-5. Among 9
miRNAs, the quantity of four miRNA expressions could be
determined. The circulating levels of hsa-miR-505-3p, miR-197-
3p and miR-500a-3p (p,0.01) were significantly decreased in
PBC compared with healthy controls and the expression levels of
hsa-miR-505-3p, miR-139-5p and miR-197-3p were significantly
reduced compared with the viral hepatitis group (Figure 2). The
quantities of miRNA expression by qRT-PCR were supported by
the data of Illumina sequencing. Of note, for samples with only
trace amounts, quantification of the reaction products after 30
cycles is uncertain. The quantity of 5 remaining miRNA
expressions indicated the Ct values under 30 cycles even in the
higher amount group or were undetected.
miRNA target genes and Gene ontology (GO) analysis
To determine possible target genes for the differentially
expressed miRNAs, we searched the miRror 2.0 database for
predicted miRNA targets in human. The ranking of miRror was
according to the miRror Internal Score (miRIS). This score is a
balance between (i) the proportions of predicting miRNA-target
prediction databases (MDBs) out of all tested MDBs and (ii) the
fraction of the potentially regulated genes from the entire input
genes [29]. A total of 75 genes were predicted as targets for 9
differentially expressed miRNAs by Illumina sequencing of hsa￾miR-1273g-5p, miR-33a-5p, miR-3960, miR-766-5p, miR-505,
miR-30b, miR-139-5p, miR-197 and miR-500a in PBC serum
(Table 5). Then, these 75 genes were submitted to Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)
v6.7, which was used for the GO biological process categorization,
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
and BIOCARTA pathway. The predicted target genes involved
biological processes such as blood circulation (5.4%), circulatory
system process (5.4%), positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF￾kappaB cascade (4.1%), regulation of phosphoprotein phosphatase
activity (2.7%), cell volume homeostasis (2.7%), regulation of
phosphatase activity (2.7%) and cellular amino acid derivative
catabolic process (2.7%), some cellular components such as cytosol
(13.5%), cell fraction (12.2%), membrane fraction (9.5%) and
protein serine/threonine phosphatase complex (4.1%), and some
molecular functions such as ion binding (33.8%), Cation binding
(33.8%), metal ion binding (33.8%) and transition metal ion
binding (25.7%) (Table S2). The functional annotation analysis of

MicroRNAs Expression in Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66086

BIOCARTA showed that the genes of catenin (cadherin￾associated protein), alpha 1 and similar to breast cancer anti￾estrogen resistance 1 predicted target genes of the listed miRNAs,
and played a role in cell-to-cell adhesion signaling pathway (Figure
S1). The KEGG pathway indicated that the genes of baculoviral
IAP repeat-containing 2, protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit
beta isoform and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member
10 were related to apoptosis (Figure S2).
Discussion
MiRNA changes in the liver have been reported in diseases such
as HCC or chronic viral hepatitis. However, there is only limited
information about their detection in blood and their correlations
in PBC patients. The current study provides the first evidence that
PBC is associated with altered miRNA expression. We have
demonstrated that a number of miRNAs, especially hsa-miR-505-
3p and miR-197-3p, were significantly differentially expressed in
patients with PBC, leading to a unique miRNA expression profile
in the diseased liver. Recently, many studies have examined
several PBC associations with genes and there have been
significant differences in the genetic risk loci reported [21] [30].
Therefore more carefully constructed studies will be needed to
clarify, the pathogenesis of PBC, and the study of these
differentially expressed miRNAs could serve in identifying
biomarkers or lead to a better understanding of the underlying
molecular mechanism that perpetuates PBC.
In our study, miRNA Illumina deep sequencing was first used to
screen 10 PBC patients’ sera. We were able to match the sample’s
sex because of particular importance for X-linked miRNA [31].
Then, qRT-PCR was used to confirm the result of deep
sequencing.
Quantitative differential expression analysis identified a 81-
miRNA signature distinguishing PBC, CH-C, CH-B and healthy
controls. A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed utilizing
the 81-miRNAs and their patterns separated the PBC from viral
hepatitis and healthy controls. In addition, there were three
subgroups (PBC-1,2,4,5, PBC-3,6,10 and PBC-7,8,9) in the PBC
cluster. When comparing the subgroups, the PBC-3, 6,10 group
showed an expression pattern that differed from those of the other
two subgroups. As for the clinical background, PBC-6 patient that
had been infected with hepatitis B virus were HBsAg negative and
anti-HBc and anti-HBs positive, and PBC-10 patient had positive
antinuclear antibodies (ANA) titers of 1:2560 or greater, while
other patients had no serological evidence of HBV infection and
no positive ANA titers of 1:160 or greater. However, there was no
clear difference between the three subgroups in terms of the
clinical stage. At present, there is no conclusive proof whether

clinical or pathological differences can be found in clustering

Nine miRNAs were confirmed to be significantly differentially
expressed between the PBC group and viral hepatitis group or
healthy control by Illumina deep sequencing. Among these 9
miRNAs, the serum levels of hsa-miR-505-3p and miR-197-3p
were significantly lower in patients with PBC than in those with
viral hepatitis and healthy controls, hsa-miR-139-5p was lower in
patients with PBC than in those with viral hepatitis and miR-500a￾3p were lower in patients with PBC than in healthy controls. Of
note, we conducted qRT-PCR on the sera of some PBC who had
already been treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. The serum levels
of miRNA showed improvements in some samples (data not
shown). Accordingly, quantifying these miRNAs may yield reliable
diagnostic information. However, one problem is that the
quantification of miRNA in this study used standardization by
the total numbers of 1,000,000 reads in the deep sequencing or a
comparative method in qRT-PCR. In other words, it was assumed
that the same amount of miRNA was contained in each serum
sample. Therefore, if one miRNA is quantified in a single
specimen, we will not be able to accurately assess the result.
Specific circulating miRNA profiles have been reported for
various diseases [32] [5] [33] [34] [35]. These circulating miRNA
profiles have been described as correlating with differentially
expressed miRNA in diseased tissue, such as liver injured by drugs
or stomach afflicted with gastric cancer [36] [37]. Moreover, some
disease-specific profiles can inform both the diagnosis and
prognosis [38] [39]. Therefore, to determine if any of these
diferentially expressed miRNAs could lead to better understanding
of the molecular mechanism that perpetuates PBC, we examined
for gene targets that may be reflected by this particular miRNA
expression signature. Of the several target prediction algorithms
prepared, we selected mirror 2.0. There has been evidence that a
seed region of miRNA positioned within a limited range in the 39
UTR of a target gene degrades the mRNA function [40]. We
predicted 75 genes as targets for 9 differentially expressed miRNAs
and conducted a functional analysis of DAVID. This analysis
revealed that the genes of catenin (cadherin-associated protein),
alpha 1 and similar to breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 1
predicted target genes of the listed miRNA and played a role in
cell-to-cell adhesion signaling, and the genes of baculoviral IAP
repeat-containing 2, protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit beta
isoform and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 10
were related to apoptosis. The onset of autoimmune disorders with
PBC can be linked to apoptosis. A previous report described that
the expression of TRAIL receptors is up-regulated by an increased
bile acid level and that the serum level of soluble TRAIL is
elevated, which may be involved in the development and
progression of PBC [41,42]. However, further work will be
required so that these miRNAs can serve not only as biomarkers
but also for the elucidation of the pathogenesis of PBC.
GO analysis provides representations of biological annotations
using precisely defined terms [43]. A previous report has described
a number of genes involved in the signaling, regulation of I￾kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade and homeostasis that are
associated with PBC [44] [45,46]. Additionally, our study
indicated the biological processes, cellular component and
molecular functions affected by the target genes included those
associated with cell or membrane fraction, various kinds of ion
binding and protein serine/threonine phosphatase complex, all of
which are potentially related to PBC. Further studies will need to
examine the relationship between differentially expressed miR￾NAs, both in serum and liver tissue, and target genes, which may
provide more insights into the role of miRNAs in the pathology of
PBC.
In conclusion, our results indicate that sera from patients with
PBC have a unique miRNA expression profile compared to viral
hepatitis and healthy controls and down-regulated expression of
hsa-miR-505-3p and 197-3p may represent new clinical biomark￾ers in PBC. This study suggests that the amounts of miRNAs in
serum have potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for
PBC.
Materials and Methods
Patients and sample processing
We included sera of 10 patients with PBC who were treatment￾naı¨ve, sera of 5 patients with CH-B, sera of 5 patients with CH-C
and sera of 5 healthy controls in this study. Initially these serum
samples were enrolled to be analyzed by the Illumina miRNA
deep sequencing (Illumina). The diagnosis of all cases was based
on internationally established criteria [23].
Library preparation and Illumina sequencing
A ten ml venous sample was collected from each participant.
The whole blood was separated into serum and cellular fractions
by centrifugation at 2,500 r.p.m. for 10 min, followed by 10 min
centrifugation at 10,000 r.p.m. to completely remove cell debris.
The supernatant serum was stored at 220uC until analysis. Total
RNA was extracted from 800 ml of serum using Trizol LS
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The libraries were constructed from
total RNA using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, RNA 39 and 59 adapters were ligated to target microRNAs
in two separate steps. Reverse transcription reaction was
conducted to the ligation products to create single stranded
cDNA. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using a common primer
and a primer containing the index sequence. One ml of each
library was loaded on an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA) to check the size, purity, and concentration. Libraries
were sequenced on an Illumina GA IIx (SCS 2.8 software;
Illumina, SanDiego, CA), with a 32-mer single end sequence.
Image analysis and base calling were performed using RTA 1.8
software.
Sequence and statistical analysis
Raw miRNA sequence reads were conducted as a quality check
and the 39 and 59 adapter sequences were removed by cutadapt
while discarding reads shorter than 20 nucleotides [27]. The
sequence reads were mapped with miRBase (Release 18) and
UCSC (hg19) by use of bwa (0.5.9-r16), allowing one nucleotide
base mismatch [47] [48].
Digital expression levels were normalized by taking into account
the length of miRNAs and the total number of miRNA reads
generated in each library using TMM normalization [28]. Read
counts of each identified miRNA was normalized to the total
number of miRNA reads, and then the ratio was multiplied by a
constant set to 16106 in this study. ANOVA was applied to extract
differentially expressed miRNAs among the four groups. Adjust￾ment of the p-value by multiple comparisons was performed by
multiple comparisons was performed by calculating FDR. Those miRNAs with FDR,0.1 were presented. The red indicates high level of miRNA
expression and the blue shows low.

calculating FDR [49]. Those miRNAs with FDR,0.1 were
extracted as differentially expressed and used in the following
analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed using an R
platform and a heat map described as using a function of
heatmap.2 in gplots [50].
qRT-PCR validation study
In addition to 25 samples analyzed by Illumina sequencing, five
more serum samples of CH-B, CH-C and healthy controls (a total
of 10 samples in each group) were used in qRT-PCR validation
study. We followed the protocol previously reported by Mitchell et
al. to determine the endogenous miRNA levels with spiked-in
miRNA. Spiked-in miRNA was designed against Caenorhabditis
elegans microRNA-39 (cel-miR-39) (59- UCA CCG GGU GUA
AAU CAG CUU -39) and was synthesized by Sigma Aldrich
Japan [32]. After total RNA isolation from 300 ml serum, reverse
transcription was conducted using a TaqMan miRNA RT kit for
identification of the cel-miR-39 expression (Applied Biosystems)
with 5 fmol/ml for the internal control. qRT-PCR were conducted
for detection of hsa-miR-1273g-5p, miR-505-3p and miR-139-5p
in 20 ml PCR reactions using TaqMan MicroRNA assay with
StepOne Plus detection system at 50uC for 2 min and 95uC for
10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 15 s and 60uC for 1 min
(Applied Biosystems). For detection of hsa-miR-33a-5p, miR-3960,
miR-766-5p, miR-30b-3p, miR-197-3p and miR-500a-3p expres￾sion, we used the Exiqon system. Total RNA was reverse
transcribed using the miRCURY LNATM Universal RT miRNA
PCR, Polyadenylation and cDNA synthesis kit (Exiqon). cDNA
diluted 506was assayed in 10 ml PCR reactions according to the
protocol for miRCURY LNATM Universal RT miRNA PCR with
StepOne Plus detection system at 95uC for 10 min, followed by 40
cycles of 95uC for 10 s and 60uC for 1 min (Exiqon). The data
were analyzed by the 22DDCt method.
Statistical methods
Expression levels of the selected miRNAs detected by qRT￾PCR were normalized to cel-miR-39 and presented as the fold￾change (22DDCt) above the control (CH-C-5): DDCt = (CtmiRNA￾Ctcel-miR-39)patients-(CtmiRNA-Ctcel-miR-39)CH-C-5. Results for normal￾ly distributed continuous variables are given as means (6standard
errors of the mean) and compared between groups by Student’s t￾test. Results for non-normally distributed continuous variables are
summarized as medians (interquartile ranges) and were compared
by Mann-Whitney U test.
In silico analysis of miRNA target gene
For computational prediction of miRNA target genes, we used
an algorithm: miRror 2.0 (June 2010 release, http://www.proto.
cs.huji.ac.il/mirror/) [51]. MiRror 2.0 encompasses most of the
available miRNA-target prediction tools covering human miR￾NAs. The algorithms used are collectively called miRNA-target
prediction databases (MDBs): (i) PITA (Kartez); (ii) PicTar 4
(Krek); (iii) TargetRank (Nielsen); (iv) TargetScan (Lewis); (v)
microCosm (John); (vi) miRanda (Betel); (vii) DIANA-microT
(Maragkakis); (viii) MirZ (Hausser); (ix) miRDB (Wang); (x) RNA
22 (Miranda); (xi) MAMI (Sethupathy); (xii) miRNAMap2 (Hsu).
The number of candidate genes and the number of miRNAs are
indicated for each of the major MDBs. We selected as the search
mode: miR2Gene; and as the search parameters of organism:
human; and of selected tissue: all. Advanced parameters were
inputted, cutoff: 0.01; database hits: 2; and target counts: 3. We
created a list of common target genes for miRNAs. Then, these
common targets were annotated by an annotation tool at the
DAVID v6.7 (January 2010 release, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.
