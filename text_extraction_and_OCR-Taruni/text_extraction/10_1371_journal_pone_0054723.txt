Abstract
Background: Romiplostim (AMG531) is a Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist with no homology with the endogenous
TPO that has been used to treat patients affected by immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Despite the use of TPO mimetics in
the clinical practice, the mechanisms underlying their impact on megakaryocyte function is still unknown.
Methodology/Principal Findings: In this project we took advantage of an in vitro human model, that we have established
in our laboratory for long time to study megakaryocyte development from human cord blood-derived progenitor cells, and
we demonstrated that increasing doses of AMG531 (100 to 2000 ng/mL) determine a progressive increase of
megakaryocyte proliferation with a parallel decrease in megakaryocyte ploidy and capacity of extending proplatelets.
Most importantly, these differences in megakaryocyte function seemed to be correlated to modulation of AKT
phosphorylation.
Conclusions/Significance: Overall our results shed new light on the mechanisms and on the relevance of dosage related to
AMG531 impact on megakaryocyte function.

Introduction
Megakaryopoiesis is a multiple stage differentiation process
under the control of thrombopoietin (TPO) [1]. Megakaryocyte
(MK) differentiation is marked by the development of progressive
polyploidy and increase of protein production [2], followed by
terminal differentiation leading to cytoskeletal reorganization,
proplatelet formation and platelet release [3,4]. Endogenous TPO
supports the maturation of MKs and stimulates platelet production
through activation of three major downstream signal transduction
pathways: JAK-STAT (Janus kinase–signal transducers and
activators of transcription), PI3K-AKT (phosphoinositol-3-ki￾nase/AKT) and two MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase),
ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2) and p38 [5–7].
Romiplostim (AMG531) is a peptide TPO receptor agonist that
has no sequence homology with endogenous thrombopoietin and
has been recently approved for treatment of certain patients with
immune thrombocytopenia [8–9]. However, the mechanistic basis
of AMG531–induced platelet production are not completely
understood. Therefore, the purpose for the present work was to
compare recombinant human TPO (rHuTPO) to AMG531 in
terms of functional and mechanistic outcome in an in vitro human
model of megakaryopoiesis.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Human cord blood was collected following normal pregnancies
and deliveries upon informed consent of the parents, in
accordance with the ethical committee of the IRCCS Policlinico
San Matteo Foundation and the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki. CD34+ cells from human cord blood samples were
separated and cultured as previously described [10]. Briefly,
CD34+ progenitor cells were separated using immunomagnetic
beads selection (Miltenyi Biotec; Bergish Gladbach, Germany) and
cultured, for 13 days, in Stem Span medium (Stem cell
Technologies; Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with 1% L￾glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ng/mL streptomicyn, 10 ng/
mL IL-6, IL-11, 10 or 100 ng/mL rHuTPO (PeproTech EC Ltd,
London, UK), and 100, 1000 or 2000 ng/mL AMG531 at 37uC
in a 5% CO2 fully humified atmosphere. MO7e cell line (Genetics
Institute, Boston, MA) was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine,
100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ng/mL streptomicyn, 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS) and 50 ng/mL GM-CSF (PeproTech EC Ltd).

Megakaryocyte Differentiation and Morphological
Analysis
MK yield was evaluated at the end of culture as previously
described [10]. Briefly cells were harvested, cytospun on glass
coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained
with a primary antibody against CD61 (clone SZ21) (Immunotech,
Marseille, France) to evaluate MK output. Nuclear counterstain￾ing was performed with Hoechst 33258 (100 ng/ml in Phosphate
Buffer Saline, PBS). Specimens were mounted in Pro Long
Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Images were acquired
by an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Deutschland GmbH,
Hamburg, Germany) using a 636/1.25 UPlanF1 oil-immersion
objective. Negative controls were routinely performed by omitting
the primary antibody. MKs were identified on the basis of CD61
expression.

To analyze proplatelet formation by MKs, 12 mm glass
coverslips were coated with 100 mg/mL fibrinogen (Sigma, Milan,
Italy), for 2 hours at room temperature (RT) and subsequently
blocked with 1% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, Milan,
Italy) for 1 hour at RT. At day 13 of culture cells were harvested,
plated onto substrate-coated coverslips in 24-wells plates, and
allowed to adhere for 16 hours at 376C and 5% CO2. After 16
hours cells were fixed in 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100, and double-stained with anti-a-tubulin antibody (clone
DM1A) (Sigma, Milan, Italy) and goat polyclonal CD61 antibody
(St. Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). Images acquired
by Olympus BX51 microscope using a 206/0.5 UPlanF1
objective or 636/1.25 oil immersion objective. MKs extending
proplatelets were identified as CD61+ cells extending a-tubulin
positive long filamentous structures. Proplatelet formation was
evaluated after 16 hours by fluorescence microscopy.
Western Immunoblotting
In order to analyze biochemical pathways activated in MO7e
megakaryoblastic cell line and human MKs by rHuTPO and
AMG531, cells were starved for 16 hours in Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and
then stimulated for 10 minutes with different concentrations of
rHuTPO or AMG531 before lysis. Thereafter, in order to analyze
the effect of prolonged incubation with these growth factors,
CD34+ cells were cultured for 13 days with rHuTPO or AMG531
before lysis. For western blot analysis MO7e or MKs were lysed as
previously described [11]. Samples containing equal amounts of
proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on 5–15% gradient
polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF)
membranes and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescent
system. Primary antibodies and dilution are listed in Table 1.
Ploidy Analysis
For ploidy analysis cells were fixed in 70% cold ethanol at
220uC overnight, centrifuged at 15006g for 10 minutes and then
resuspended in PBS containing 1 mg/mL Propidium Iodide
(Sigma) and 50 mg/mL RNAse (Sigma) and incubated with
10 mg/mL anti-human CD41 conjugated with FITC (eBioscience
Inc, San Diego, USA) for 30 minutes at room temperature in the
dark. Samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur
flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using Cell Quest analysis
software.
Statistics
Data are presented as mean 6 SD. One-way ANOVA followed
by the post-hoc Bonferroni’s t-test was used to analyze data, with a
significant difference set at p,0.05. All experiments were
independently performed at least 3 times.

patients [12–15]. Importantly, AMG531 was shown to bound to c￾mpl and promote the growth of colony-forming units-megakaryo￾cyte (CFU-Meg) in a concentration-dependent manner [16].
Endogenous TPO activates PI3K-AKT and MAPK downstream
signaling pathways: AKT and ERK1/2 have been shown to play a
crucial role in Mk maturation and platelet formation, while, at
present, there is no functional evidence for a role of p38 MAPKs
[11,17–19]. Therefore, to learn more about how rHuTPO and
AMG531 affect MK function, we first evaluated their effects on
activation of ERK1/2, AKT and p38 in human MKs and MO7e
cell line cultured in a serum/cytokine-free medium overnight and
subsequently stimulated for 10 minutes with increasing concen￾trations of either rHuTPO or AMG531. rHuTPO and AMG531
concentrations were determined on the basis of our prior studies
[20] and literature [8,16]. As shown in Figure 1A, activation of
ERK1/2 and AKT resulted concentration-dependent in both
rHuTPO and AMG531 treated cells, while constant activation
was observed for p38. Specifically, increased levels of pERK1/2
and pAKT were observed upon stimulation with 100 ng/mL
rHuTPO and 1000 ng/mL AMG531 [8]. Importantly, 1000 ng/
mL of AMG531 represented the concentration peak as higher
concentrations did not determined additional increase of ERK1/2
and AKT phosphorylation levels (Figure 1B–C). On these basis,
we further analyzed the impact of prolonged incubation with
different concentrations of AMG531 in an in vitro system for
human MK development. Human umbilical cord blood derived
CD34+ cells were cultured in the presence of increasing doses of
AMG531 and functional outcomes were compared in terms of
MK differentiation and output, ploidy, proplatelet formation and
morphology. Since no differences in MK differentiation or
function were observed with increasing concentrations of
rHuTPO (data not shown) we took 10 ng/mL of rHuTPO as
the reference concentration for our experiments. After two weeks
of culture all AMG531 doses, as well as rHuTPO, promoted the
differentiation of most of the progenitors cells (7565% for
rHuTPO, 7463%, 7364%, 7365% for AMG 100, 1000 and
2000 respectively) into MKs expressing the main megakaryocytic
markers (Figure 2A–B). However, MKs differentiated with higher
doses of AMG531 (1000 ng/mL and above) showed a decrease in
size (Figure 2A) and ploidy (Figure 2C) that corresponded to a
marked increase in MK output and proliferation (Figure 2D) as
compared to lower AMG531 dose (100 ng/mL) and rHuTPO.
Importantly, regardless of concentration, MKs differentiated in
the presence of AMG531 demonstrated a defective capacity of
extending proplatelets as compared to MKs cultured with
rHuTPO (Figure 2E–F), while proplatelet morphology and
tubulin distribution did not show any alteration (Figure 2G).
Finally, in order to correlate functional outcome with biochemical
signaling, we performed western blot analysis on mature MKs that
demonstrated a significant increase in AKT phoshorylation in
MKs cultured with higher dose of AMG531 (1000 and 2000 ng/
mL) as compared to lower dose of AMG531 (100 ng/mL) and
rHuTPO, while no variations were observed for pERK1/2 and
pp38 (Figure 2H). Overall these results pointed out a different
impact of increasing dose of AMG531 on MK function and
biochemistry. In order to further explore this mechanism, we also
asked whether increasing concentrations of rHuTPO could exert
different effect on MK signalling despite the preservation of their
functionality. Therefore, MKs were derived from human umbilical
cord blood progenitors, as reported above, in the presence of
increasing doses of rHuTPO (10 and 100 ng/mL) and western
blot analysis was performed at the end of the cultures. As reported
in Figure 3 we observed a significant increase in both AKT and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MKs cultured with higher dose
(100 ng/mL) as compared to lower dose (10 ng/mL) of rHuTPO.
Interstingly, the observed increase in AKT and ERK1/2
phosphorylation was not paralleled by an increase of MK
functionality and platelet production suggesting that a balance
between AKT and ERK1/2 activation, rather than the level of
phosphorylation, is necessary to sustain MK development.
Importantly, in previous work [11] we showed that AKT
phosphorylation occurred during proplatelet formation by human
MKs; here we extend this observation by demonstrating that a
modulation of AKT and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation is necessary to
induce proplatelet formation, while increased levels of AKT
phosphorylation lead to MK proliferation [21] with reduced
ploidy and proplatelet formation.
In conclusion, our results provide novel insight into the
mechanisms of MK development and proplatelet formation upon
treatment with AMG531 leading to new concepts in understand￾ing how this TPO mimetic determines and regulates MK function.
Our results point out an effect of AMG531 in promoting MK
proliferation rather than MK maturation and proplatelet forma￾tion (Table 2). Despite the limitation of an in vitro model, our data
are important to demonstrate that increasing dose of AMG531
