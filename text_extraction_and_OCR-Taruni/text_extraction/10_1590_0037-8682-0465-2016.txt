Abstract
Introduction: A total of 771 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were reported in Brazil in 2014. Treatment of 
MDR-TB with aminoglycosides can produce serious side effects such as permanent and irreversible hearing loss, which occurs in 
5-64% of cases, and severely compromise patient quality of life. The goal of this research was to evaluate auditory and vestibular 
side effects in patients treated for MDR-TB and to identify associations between these complaints and the type of aminoglycoside 
used. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 599 medical records from patients with MDR-TB who were treated at 
the Hélio Fraga/Fiocruz Reference Center between 2006 and 2010. Cases without auditory or vestibular complaints and patients 
who were not treated with aminoglycoside drugs were excluded from the study. Results: Of 164 eligible cases, 55 (33.5%) 
reported an auditory or vestibular complaint and medication was subsequently suspended, although hearing damage was not 
confirmed in all cases. Audiometric testing confirmed hearing loss in 11 (21.7%) of 12 cases submitted for evaluation. Hearing 
loss related to ototoxicity was confirmed in 15 (62.5%) cases. Tinnitus was significantly associated with the use of amikacin and 
streptomycin. Conclusions: Evaluations of ototoxicity symptoms were not usually reported in the routine care of patients with 
MDR-TB. Complaints of tinnitus were associated with amikacin and streptomycin use. These results require confirmation in 
future studies.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the increasing incidence of multidrug￾resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a significant 
concern for policy makers. The World Health Organization1 
estimated that in 2014, there were 480,000 new cases of MDR￾TB worldwide and approximately 190,000 deaths related to 
MDR-TB1
. Brazil is ranked 17 among the 22 countries with 
the highest number of cases of MDR-TB, reporting 70,000 new 
cases and 4,600 related deaths annually1,2. Moreover, an increase 
in the number of MDR-TB cases was recently reported in Rio 
de Janeiro State in the year 20152
.
Patients with MDR-TB characterized by bacilli resistant to 
first-line treatments including rifampicin and isoniazid require 
the use of second-line medications such as aminoglycosides. 
Aminoglycosides have been used to treat TB for more than 40 
years3
.These agents are cost-effective and widely used in low￾and middle-income countries2,3. Yet, aminoglycoside use for the 
treatment of MDR-TB is associated with ototoxicity in 5-64% 
in cases3-11. Ototoxicity can produce hearing loss and associated 
psychosocial changes that negatively affect quality of life12.
Recent research has highlighted the importance of auditory 
monitoring in patients receiving aminoglycosides3,5,11,. Auditory 
monitoring facilitates the early identification of injury before 
the onset of hearing loss of tonal thresholds in the range 
of conventional frequencies used in speech. Consequently, 
screening and appropriate treatment can reduce the effect of 
aminoglycoside-related ototoxicity on quality of life. There is 
little data on ototoxicity in patients receiving aminoglycosides 
for the treatment of MDR-TB in Brazil7,11. Therefore, the goal of 
this study was to retrospectively evaluate auditory and vestibular 
complaints in patients treated for MDR-TB at a reference center 
in Rio de Janeiro State, and to analyze relationships between 
these complaints and the type of aminoglycoside used.
METHODS
We retrospectively enrolled patients with MDR-TB who 
attended the outpatient clinic at Helio Fraga Reference Center/
FIOCRUZ between January 2006 and December 2010. Clinical 

 647
de Vasconcelos KA et. al - Hearing loss after MDR-TB treatment
and socio-demographic data were obtained from the medical 
records of the National Surveillance System for MDR-TB. 
Secondary data were obtained from clinic medical records. 
Clinical variables included hearing complaints such as hearing 
loss (difficulty hearing or understanding speech), tinnitus, and 
dizziness were verified in this study. Information about the 
discontinuation of aminoglycosides due to auditory or vestibular 
complaints and requests for audiometric evaluation were also 
recorded. Hearing test results were recorded from medical charts 
and analyzed separately for each ear. Cases of MDR-TB were 
excluded from the analysis if there were no auditory or vestibular 
data or if an aminoglycoside was not administered. 
Associations between the most frequent symptoms and the 
variables studied (aminoglycoside, sex, age, schooling, previous 
use of an aminoglycoside, and previous treatment) were tested 
using Chi-square tests. The threshold for statistical significance 
was p < 0.05. The epiinfo version 7 program was used. 
Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of 
the Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho/Universidade 
Federal do Rio de Janeiro (approval no. 75676/12).
The procedures used were in accordance with the ethical 
standards of the responsible human experimentation committee 
(institutional, regional or national) and in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki of 1964, revised in 1975, 1983, 1989, 
1996 and 2000.
RESULTS
Of 599 medical records analyzed, 417 (69.6%) were excluded 
from the analysis due to the absence of auditory/vestibular 
complaints and 10 (1.7%) were excluded due to use of a non￾aminoglycoside treatment regimen. In the remaining 172 (28.7%) 
cases, amikacin was administered in 145 (84.3%) patients and 
streptomycin was administered in 19 (11%) patients (Figure 1).
One or more auditory/vestibular complaints were reported 
in 164 (95.3%) cases; hypoacusis was reported in 116 (70.7%) 
cases, tinnitus was reported in 88 (53.6%) cases, and dizziness 
was reported in 28 (17%) cases (Figure 2). Fifty-five (33.5%) 
patients discontinued the medication after reporting a hearing or 
vestibular complaint; however, only 12 (21.8%) of these cases 
underwent evaluation. Audiometric testing confirmed hearing 
loss in 11 (91.7%) of 12 cases, with 8 exhibiting sensorineural￾type hearing loss with a downward curve compatible with 
ototoxicity. The grade of hearing loss ranged from mild to 
severe. It is worth noting in the Figure 3 that classifications 
of hearing loss were conducted at all frequencies (i.e., from 
0.25kHz to 8kHz).
An analysis of the time period between treatment initiation 
with aminoglycosides and the report of a hearing complaint 
revealed that both tinnitus and hearing loss were associated 
with duration of use (Table 1). Tinnitus was also associated 
with amikacin use and young age, and while hearing loss was 
associated with male gender. In contrast, vestibular complaints 
(dizziness) had the highest frequency at the beginning of 
treatment (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
Although the ototoxic effects of aminoglycosides were first 
described in the 1940s, the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. Hearing damage associated with aminoglycoside use 
can include permanent hearing loss and tinnitus secondary to 
the degradation of sensorineural hair cells of the cochlea and/
or vestibule. Damage to cochlear hair cells is thought to be 
mediated by oxidative stress, starting at the base where high￾frequency sounds are decoded and advancing to the apex6,8,13,14,15. 
In the present study, we identified hearing complaints after 
aminoglycoside use in 27% of medical records analyzed, similar 
to what has been described in the literature (27.8%)11. Higher 
frequencies of TB and hearing complaints among male subjects 
in our study were also consistent with previous reports. This 
finding may be related to the increased tendency for ototoxicity 
risk factor exposure in men compared to women4,11,13.
In this study, we examined the relationship between hearing 
complaints and the type of aminoglycoside used, as different 
types of aminoglycosides affect different areas of the auditory and 
vestibular systems. Amikacin is described in the literature as a 
synthetic aminoglycoside that can cause damage to cochlear cells 
to produce clinical presentations including tinnitus and hearing 
loss. In contrast, streptomycin preferentially affects cells of the 
vestibule, but can also cause damage to the cells of the cochlea. 
In such cases, the first symptom is dizziness, followed by tinnitus 
and hearing loss. These mechanisms are partly consistent with our 
observation that amikacin and streptomycin use were associated 
with tinnitus. The lack of a significant association between use 
of these medications and hearing loss may have been due to the 
small number of cases included in this study. It is also noteworthy 
that by the time individuals perceive hearing loss, the lesion has 
already progressed to affect the area of the cochlea responsible 
for the transduction of sound in the frequencies of human speech. 
Therefore, some subjects may have had yet undetectable hearing loss.
Some phonemes such as [s], [f], and [t] have low intensities, 
such that any loss in high frequencies can hinder their 
perception5,9. Difficulty hearing but not understanding what is 
being said can cause embarrassment and lead to social isolation, 
often with occupational consequences5
. Because of this, it is 
essential to carefully consider patient complaints of hearing loss 
or difficulty understanding speech. A hearing aid is one possible 
solution in patients with damage related to aminoglycoside use; 
however, hearing aids are expensive, especially considering the 
socioeconomic level of the majority of individuals with TB in 
low- and middle-income countries16. The referral of patients 
with hearing loss to centers of medium- and high-complexity 
Hearing Health Programs of the Ministry of Health operated in 
conjunction with state governments is the most suitable option 
given the socioeconomic profile of the population studied.
Tinnitus was the second most frequent hearing complaint in 
this study. Tinnitus is defined as an auditory perception in the 
absence of an actual stimulus. The subjective characteristics 
of tinnitus complicate investigations of its pathophysiology. 
Tinnitus is fairly common in clinical practice; although there are 
no studies about its prevalence in Brazil, tinnitus affects nearly 
40 million people in the United States and England5,9. Previous

studies have described an association between tinnitus and the 
use of amikacin and streptomycin as well as the appearance of 
tinnitus prior to hearing loss9
. At present, there is no treatment 
for tinnitus induced by ototoxicity, as the hearing damage is 
irreversible. Rather, strategies to mask the perception of tinnitus 
can be used to prevent symptoms from interfering with day-to￾day life. The most frequent strategies indicated are the use of 
background music to fall asleep, relaxation techniques, and a 
noise-generating hearing aid.
Dizziness is a vestibular complaint defined as an illusory 
sense of rotation associated with impaired perception of mobile 
environments5
. Damage to the hair cells of the vestibular system 
(the bulb and otolith organs) can activate the reflex responses 
generated by head, eye, and body movements triggering 
dizziness5,9,15. Although the relationship between streptomycin 
use and dizziness is well characterized in the literature5
,we did 
not identify this association in our population. Nevertheless, 
dizziness was the most frequently reported complaint at the 
beginning of treatment. This can be explained by the normal 
physiological response to damage caused by vestibulotoxic 
agents; injury to the vestibular system is followed by 
neurological reorganization to restore corporal equilibrium

over time. Therefore, patients exposed to vestibulotoxic agents 
may initially experience some imbalance or dizziness and 
recover thereafter. Vestibular rehabilitation or labyrinthine 
rehabilitation can accelerate the process of compensation in 
cases of dizziness resulting from the use of ototoxic drugs.
In the present study, approximately 70% of records analyzed 
were excluded because there were no reported adverse events 
of interest. Auditory and vestibular complaints should have a 
prominent place in the medical records of patients with MDR￾TB who are treated with aminoglycosides. When a complaint 
was reported, physicians discontinued aminoglycoside treatment 
without laboratorial confirmation of hearing loss. Awareness of 
the consequences of a hearing loss and delays for diagnosis in 
the public health system likely caused physicians and patients to 
decide against the continuation of treatment. In our study, only 
27% patients were referred for hearing assessment and of these, 
91% of cases were confirmed to have hearing loss. The addition 
of an on-site or referral team of otolaryngologists and audiologists 
to TB clinics can enable the proper testing and monitoring of 
auditory and vestibular function in patients treated for MDR-TB. 
The present study had some limitations. First, the effects or 
contributions of confounding variables for hearing loss such as 
smoking and noise exposure were not studied and are not currently 
known in the context of aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Our results 
suggest that cases of hearing loss identified in this study were due 
to aminoglycoside use, given the types of impairment, the period 
of onset, and the audiometric configuration. A high prevalence 
of sensorineural bilateral loss with downward curves among 
individuals tested suggests a possible association that should 
be examined in future studies. Second, the study was limited 
by a retrospective design and the availability of data in patient 
medical records/missing data. The attending medical specialists 
at MDR-TB reference centers do not habitually document data on 
auditory or vestibular complaints. Proper auditory monitoring and 
the careful assessment of hearing complaints should be routine 
procedures in treating patients with MDR-TB.
The development of standard operating protocols for 
monitoring hearing has not been a priority in medical practice; 
however, a systematic investigation into the hearing conditions 
of patients exposed to ototoxic drugs would: 1) support clinical 
decisions; 2) provide an assessment of the overall effectiveness 
of current clinical methods for monitoring ototoxicity; and 3) 
aid the development of programs for clinical application.
