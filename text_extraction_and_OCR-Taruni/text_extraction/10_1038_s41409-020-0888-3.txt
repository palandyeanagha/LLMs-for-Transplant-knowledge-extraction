Abstract
We report results of a phase II study of maraviroc to prevent acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) in children undergoing
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Oral maraviroc was added to standard GVHD prophylaxis of a
calcineurin inhibitor with either mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate or steroids from day −3 until day +30 after HSCT.
Maraviroc trough levels were analyzed on day 0, +7, 14, and 21. We assessed functional CCR5 blockade by our previously
described pharmacodynamic assay. In total, 17 patients were enrolled prospectively. No patient had liver GVHD by day
+100. Four patients developed gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD (Grade II upper GI GVHD n = 2, grade III lower GI GVHD n =
2). No adverse effects of maraviroc were observed. Seven patients discontinued maraviroc at a median of day +14 (range
day +1–day +29) due to study rules regarding hepatotoxicity (n = 5), renal function decline (n = 1) and withdrawal from
study (n = 1). Maraviroc administration led to CCR5 inhibition but was limited by study rules defining hepatotoxicity,
leading to frequent drug discontinuation. We cannot comment on the efficacy of maraviroc with our data but speculate that it
could have a role in prevention of acute GI GVHD, with adequate compliance.
Introduction
Visceral acute graft versus host disease is one of the most
challenging complications following allogeneic hemato￾poietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [1]. Standard acute
GVHD prophylaxis regimens result in acute GVHD rates of
30–70% and are associated with adverse effects including
immune suppression and risks of opportunistic infections
[2]. Novel treatments for the prevention of acute GVHD are
needed to improve outcomes for patients [3].
CCR5 is a chemokine expressed on the surface of lym￾phocytes actively trafficking to the intestinal tract and the
liver [4, 5]. CCR5 inhibition was explored as a novel
strategy to prevent acute GVHD in adults in a pilot study
with promising results [6]. Maraviroc, an oral CCR5 inhi￾bitor originally developed for the treatment of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [7] was added to standard
acute GVHD prophylaxis in 35 adult allogeneic HSCT
patients. No visceral GVHD was observed by day +100 in
these patients [6]. Based on these encouraging results,
maraviroc was added to standard acute GVHD prophylaxis

regimens in a multicenter trial as part of a three-arm study to
prevent acute GVHD [8]. There is however lack of evidence
of efficacy of maraviroc as determined by phase II rando￾mized controlled trials [8], despite variable early efficacy in
single arm studies [6, 9].
We hypothesized that addition of maraviroc to standard
acute GVHD prophylactic regimens in children would
reduce day +100 incidence of intestinal and liver GVHD.
We conducted a phase I/II study of feasibility, safety, and
efficacy of maraviroc in children 2 years of age and older
using the dose of maraviroc was we previously established
in our phase I study [10]. In this report, we describe find￾ings of the phase II study.
Methods
Eligible patients were enrolled on study after obtaining
informed consent. The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical
Center Institutional Review Board approved this study.
Patients were eligible to receive maraviroc if they were at least
2 years of age, undergoing an allogeneic HSCT and were
receiving acute GVHD prophylaxis consisting of a calcineurin
inhibitor combined with either mycophenolate mofetil,
methylprednisolone or methotrexate. All underlying diag￾noses, preparative regimens and stem cell sources were eli￾gible. Exclusion criteria included any prior allergic reactions
to maraviroc, history of HIV, ex-vivo T-cell depleted stem
cell graft, an alanine aminotransferase level >5× upper limit
of normal (ULN) and intolerance to oral medications. This
study was registered under clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02167451.
Maraviroc was administered under an investigational new
drug number 122997.
We used the dosing of 300 mg/m2/day maraviroc as
established by our phase I study (Supplement Table 1). We
started maraviroc on day −3 and continued until day +30
after stem cell infusion. Maraviroc was administered orally,
twice daily and patients needed to take at least 80% of all
planned doses to be evaluable. Maraviroc was dosed as either
150 mg tablets or as a 20 mg/mL solution, provided to us by
Pfizer. We obtained maraviroc trough levels on day 0, +7,
+14, and +21 after stem cell infusion. No strong CYP3A4
inhibitors or inducers were allowed during the period
of maraviroc administration to prevent drug interactions. We
followed patients until day +100 for incidence of acute
GVHD which was graded by the modified Glucksberg cri￾teria [11] by the treating physician.
We had stringent rules for discontinuing maraviroc for
grade 3 or higher liver toxicity (alanine aminotransferase
>5× ULN or total bilirubin >3 × ULN) regardless of etiol￾ogy and did not restart the drug because of a black box
warning regarding liver toxicity. In addition, we held mar￾aviroc for a drop in renal function to creatinine clearance
<40 mL/min as measured by GFR or cystatin C. We mon￾itored adverse effects using the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. We
measured maraviroc trough levels by liquid chromato￾graphy/mass spectroscopy with the dynamic range of the
assay between 1 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL. Goal maraviroc
concentrations were ≥100 ng/mL.
We performed pharmacodynamic analyses of CCR5
inhibition using our previously described assay [10].
Briefly, we incubated 100 µL of healthy control blood with
100 µL of patient plasma before transplantation, day 0, and
day +14, in the presence of 100 nM of CCL5 at 37 °C and
5% CO2 for 60 min. We stained these cells with fluorescent
antibodies against CD3, CD8, CCR7, CD45RA, and CCR5
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), after which red cells were
lysed using FACSlyse (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for
10 min. Samples were washed and surface expression of
CCR5 was assessed on CD8+ effector memory T-cells by a
BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer (San Jose, CA). We
gated on effector memory T cells, defined as CD3+CD8+
CCR7−CD45RA− T-cells. In the presence of CCL5, CCR5
internalizes and is not detected via surface flow cytometry,
but this expression is preserved when CCR5 in inhibited
successfully with maraviroc. A concentration of ~50 ng/mL
of maraviroc inhibits CCR5 internalization on CD8+
effector memory T cells.
Our historical incidence rate of acute visceral GVHD in
pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell trans￾plantation with GVHD prophylaxis consisting of a calci￾neurin inhibitor with methylprednisolone, mycophenolate
mofetil or methotrexate was 22% (2012–2013 data at
CCHMC). Comparisons between rates of acute and chronic
GVHD in patients who received maraviroc to historic
controls and associations between gastrointestinal (GI)
GVHD incidence and maraviroc trough levels were made
using Fisher two sided exact tests. Differences between
patients enrolled on the maraviroc study and historic con￾trols were assessed using the Log-Rank test.
Results
We enrolled 17 patients on the phase II arm. The median
age of patients on the phase II arm was 13 years (range
2–25 years). Additional demographics are shown in
Table 1. All patients received a calcineurin inhibitor with
methotrexate (n = 6), mycophenolate mofetil (n = 5), and
methylprednisolone (n = 6) as the second agent.
All patients were started on oral maraviroc from day −3
until day+30 after BMT, where day 0 was the day of stem
cell infusion. Four patients received the liquid formulation
while the rest received tablets. We used maraviroc dosing as
established by our phase I study at 300 mg/m2/day.

Eight patients did not receive the complete course of
maraviroc. One patient had intermittent compliance to
maraviroc and missed six doses of maraviroc as docu￾mented by nursing administration records, due to nausea.
One patient withdrew from study early. Five patients stop￾ped maraviroc due to hepatotoxicity. One patient had Sta￾phylococcus aureus sepsis and experienced decline in renal
function to below 40 mL/min due to intravenous vanco￾mycin treatment, leading to discontinuation of maraviroc
(Table 2). Of the five patients who experienced hepato￾toxicity, one patient with CD40 ligand deficiency had pre￾existing sclerosing cholangitis due to Cryptosporidium
parvum infection which was exacerbated after HSCT. Three
patients developed sinusoidal obstructive syndrome which
was an expected complication post HSCT due to their
myeloablative conditioning regimen (n = 3) and concurrent
pre-existing iron overload in one patient.
The CTCAE version 4.03 defines grade 3 liver toxicity as
an elevation in serum bilirubin levels to ≥3 × ULN without
specifying the fraction of bilirubin. Prior to our protocol

amendment clarifying that a grade 3 hepatotoxicity was an
elevation in total bilirubin to >3 × ULN, an elevation in
direct bilirubin to >3 x ULN was also considered a grade 3
hepatoxicity. We had to discontinue maraviroc in patient
#19 when his direct bilirubin levels reached 0.9 mg/dL
(ULN for direct bilirubin in our laboratory was 0.3 mg/dL).
This patient’s total bilirubin levels at the time of dis￾continuation of maraviroc was 2.1 mg/dL (ULN in our
laboratory is 1.1 mg/dL) and his serum alanine amino￾transferase was within normal limits. This patient did not
experience sinusoidal obstructive syndrome or additional
liver complications. An ultrasound showed mild dilation of
the common bile duct which could have caused biliary
sludging leading to mild elevations in total and direct bilir￾ubin levels which resolved without specific interventions.
Engraftment
Neutrophil engraftment occurred at a median of 12 days
(range 10–21 days) after stem cell infusion in all patients,
while platelet engraftment occurred at a median of 21 days
(range 12–40 days) after stem cell infusion in 12 patients.
One patient developed mixed chimerism. No patient on
study experienced primary graft failure. One patient with
mixed chimerism experienced secondary graft failure and
was successfully transplanted again.
Maraviroc trough levels
We measured maraviroc trough levels in all patients at day
0, +7, +14, and +21 if maraviroc was still being admi￾nistered at these time points. Nine patients had maraviroc
trough levels <100 ng/mL at day zero but improved
to >100 ng/mL with subsequent measurements. Most
patients achieved a median maraviroc concentration of
>100 ng/mL by day +7 and day +14 (Fig. 1). Two
patients (Pt #18 and Pt #22) had trough levels <100 ng/mL
at all measured time points while one patient (Pt #26) had
trough levels <100 ng/mL on day zero, 14 and 21 and
developed upper GI GVHD.
We performed a Fisher’s exact test to test the asso￾ciation of maraviroc levels <100 ng/mL at day zero and
maraviroc levels <100 ng/mL at multiple time points with
the incidence of acute GI GVHD and found no association
(p = 0.6 for low day zero maraviroc levels and p = 0.5 for
low maraviroc levels at multiple time points).The lack of
association however could be a reflection of our small
sample size.
Pharmacodynamic assay results
We measured percent CCR5 internalization in all patients
prior to starting maraviroc, at day zero and day +14.
Consistent with above described maraviroc trough levels,
the percent CCR5 internalization was decreased in the
presence of maraviroc at most time points except in patients
who had maraviroc trough levels <50 ng/mL on day zero
(n = 3) and day +14 (n = 2) (Fig. 2). Pt #22 had increased
CCR5 internalization on PD assay on day zero and day
+14 suggesting that CCR5 was not completely blocked
with maraviroc; this patient also had lower maraviroc
trough concentrations at all measured time points. Pt #26
also demonstrated increased CCR5 internalization on PD
assay at day zero and day +14 and had low maraviroc
trough levels as mentioned above. This patient subsequently
developed acute GI GVHD (Table 3).
Incidence of acute GVHD at day +100
Two patients developed grade II acute skin GVHD and
were successfully treated with corticosteroids. Four
patients developed GI GVHD (Grade II upper GI GVHD
n = 2, grade III lower GI GVHD n = 2). No patient
developed liver GVHD (Table 3). Two of the 4 patients
with GI GVHD did not receive the planned 34 days of
maraviroc. One patient (Pt# 26) with upper GI GVHD had
subtherapeutic maraviroc levels on day 0, +7 and +14
and lacked CCR5 blockade on PD assay. Finally, one
patient with excellent compliance to oral maraviroc and
adequate trough levels developed GI GVHD on day +71.

This patient experienced idiopathic intracranial hyper￾tension for which an aggressive calcineurin inhibitor wean
was initiated. This wean of calcineurin inhibitors prior to
day +100 could have also contributed to symptoms of
GI GVHD.
Day +180 acute GVHD and Chronic GVHD
No patient developed acute GVHD between day +100 and
day +180. Three patients developed chronic GVHD (mild
n = 1, severe n = 2).
Adverse effects of maraviroc
Several grade ≥3 adverse effects were documented on
study, but none were attributed to maraviroc (Table 4). All
evaluable patients received at least 80% of their planned
doses.
Infectious complications
Six patients had 11 episodes of bacteremia before day +100
after HSCT (Staphylococcus aureus n = 2, Enterobacter
aerogenes n = 1, Klebsiella oxytoca n = 2, Escherichia coli
n = 1, Enterococcus faecalis n = 2, Bacillus sp. n = 1,
Bacteroides fragilis n = 1, Citrobacter sp. n = 1). Two
patients had documented fungal (Candida lusitania blood￾stream infection) or presumed fungal infection as evidenced
by imaging. Five patients (29%) had asymptomatic cyto￾megalovirus viremia while one patient had CMV pneumo￾nitis. Four patients (23%) had asymptomatic Epstein–Barr
virus viremia. Two patients had clinically significant ade￾novirus viremia (adenovirus encephalitis and adenovirus
colitis) needing antiviral treatment. Four patients (23%) had
asymptomatic BK viremia while one patient had BK virus
associated hemorrhagic cystitis. One patient with sclerosing
cholangitis had Cryptosporidium parvum infection early
after stem cell infusion. No patients had evidence of
Pneumocystis jirovecii infection.
Survival
Thirteen patients were alive by day +100 after HSCT.
Causes of death included liver failure due to autoimmune
hepatitis n = 1, Candida sp. sepsis n = 1, adenoviral ence￾phalitis and multiorgan failure n = 1, idiopathic pneumonia
syndrome and multiorgan failure n = 1. At a median last
follow up of 638 days (range 48–1169 days) 11 patients are
alive. One patient died at day +249 after HSCT due to
multiorgan failure following late onset sinusoidal obstruc￾tive syndrome while another patient died due to progressive
GVHD at day +203 after HSCT.

Discussion
We describe the results of the first prospective phase II
study of the use of maraviroc as an acute GVHD prophy￾lactic agent in children. We achieved successful CCR5
blockade in most patients but also believe that the lack of
consistent administration of maraviroc during the critical
period after HSCT contributed to breakthrough of acute
GVHD rates on our study. The feasibility of maraviroc
administration was limited by hepatotoxicity leading to
cessation of the drug in several patients. This was further
compounded by the cautious approach mandated by reg￾ulatory authorities to maraviroc administration due to its
black box warning regarding hepatotoxicity. We cannot
comment on the efficacy of maraviroc administration with
our data, but speculate that if adequate compliance could be
maintained, it may be a promising agent in children with
pre-existing colitis.
Unlike indications for adult transplants which are mostly
malignancies, pediatric allogeneic transplants comprise
heterogeneous diagnoses. It was our goal to offer maraviroc
to all eligible children with underlying malignant and
nonmalignant diagnoses. We recognize that the hetero￾geneity of the patient population in terms of underlying
diagnoses and preparative regimens makes it difficult to
extrapolate our dosing data to additional patient popula￾tions. Several GVHD prophylaxis agent combinations were
used because these combinations reflected the most fre￾quently used GVHD prophylaxis in children at our center.
Two formulations of maraviroc were also used on study to
encompass the unique needs of children in terms of medi￾cation dosing and administration. We believe this to be a
realistic view of pediatric transplantation approaches.
We previously established the dose of maraviroc in our
phase I study but observed lack of adequate maraviroc
trough levels at day zero in nine patients on the phase II
study. This is notable especially in the light of data in adult
HSCT recipients where higher day zero maraviroc drug
levels were associated with lower acute GVHD rates [9]. In
our study, subsequent maraviroc trough levels improved in
all but three patients. There could be several reasons for the
lack of adequate trough levels in our trial. One patient in our
trial (patient #18) could have lower drug levels related to
cytochrome p450 polymorphisms [12], which may decrease
maraviroc exposure despite appropriate dosing, as is known
to occur in patients of African ancestry. We extrapolated
maraviroc dosing for adults based on published adult dosing
of maraviroc, but all adults were on azoles without dose
modifications and routinely had higher maraviroc troughs
than their target levels [6]. Our trial did not allow con￾comitant azoles with maraviroc, which could have also
resulted in lower trough levels in adult patients such as
Table 4

in patient #26 remain unclear. We batched our trough level
analyses but our data underscore the importance of drug
level monitoring and dose adjustments in real time
We observed a similar rate of acute skin GVHD on our
study compared with historic rates which was not surprising
because maraviroc does not prevent acute skin GVHD.
All patients with skin GVHD were treated successfully with
topical or systemic immune suppression. The incidence of
acute GI GVHD was comparable to historic controls. Two of
the four patients who developed acute GI GVHD did not
complete 34 days of maraviroc, once again highlighting the
limitations of maraviroc administration. Collectively, these
limited data do not suggest efficacy of maraviroc in children
undergoing HSCT. Additional variables such as rates of
infectious complications, secondary graft failure, chronic
GVHD rates and survival were comparable between patients
who received maraviroc and historic controls. Patients
receiving maraviroc did not experience adverse effects that
were clearly attributable to the drug.
In murine studies, CCR5 deficient T-cells transferred into
irradiated mice resulted in worsening GVHD likely due to
the inhibition of regulatory T-cell trafficking to the GI tract
[13]. Another murine study demonstrated that disrupting the
CCR5 gene resulted in interruption of recruitment of T-cells
into the intestine and therefore resulted in lower incidence
of GVHD in non-irradiated haplo identical recipients [5].
Based on these murine data, we attempted to enroll patients
who did not receive any radiation in their preparative
regimen to avoid the possible inadvertent higher incidence
of acute visceral GVHD. While the adult transplant patients
received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen and were
able to successfully prevent acute visceral GVHD at day
+1009
, we chose to include patients who received
both myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning
regimens to be eligible to receive maraviroc assuming
that children may behave differently biologically than
adults. Four patients developed acute GI GVHD and two
did not complete 34 days of planned maraviroc treatment.
One patient who received non-TBI myeloablative con￾ditioning regimen had low maraviroc drug levels despite
excellent compliance, while another patient who received a
reduced intensity conditioning regimen developed GI
GVHD despite excellent compliance and adequate drug
levels. We cannot comment on the role of conditioning
regimens on the incidence of acute GVHD in our clinical
cohort due to small sample size.
Available clinical data in adult HSCT recipients suggest
a beneficial role for maraviroc in unrelated donor HSCTs.
We enrolled six related donor HSCTs to receive maraviroc
and did not observe evidence of acute GVHD in these
patients, likely due to a combination of good compliance to
the medication, adequate maraviroc levels at most time
points and a lower risk due to a fully HLA matched sibling
donor. All maraviroc recipients in our study who developed
GI GVHD received unrelated donor grafts. We cannot
comment on the beneficial role of maraviroc in unrelated
donor HSCTs based on our data.
Maraviroc administration in adults HSCT recipients
showed no differences in rates of grade II–IV and grades
III–IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD and overall survival
compared with controls [8]. While our data are similar,
given the differences between the adult and pediatric
transplant patient populations including preparative regi￾mens, GVHD prophylactic agents and underlying diag￾noses, these comparisons are limited in scope.
We chose to administer maraviroc until day +30 in our
patient population because of the published data in adults
at the time of our study design. As maraviroc was being
used in children for the first time, the regulatory agencies
did not support an extended course of maraviroc during
our initial trial. We were encouraged by the lower GRFS
in patients who received maraviroc until day +90 [9] and
speculate that a longer duration of maraviroc might have a
greater impact in terms of acute and chronic GVHD
prevention in children. However, we also recognize that
future studies will need to explore these hypotheses in
pediatrics.
Our original study plan was to enroll 50 patients on the
phase II study, but we stopped after enrolling the 17th
patient on the phase II study due to slow accrual on the
study and expiration of the liquid formulation of maraviroc
which was manufactured by Pfizer for this study. We
believe there is a role for a larger pediatric study with less
stringent rules regarding drug discontinuation due to hepa￾totoxicity in the future.
Limitations of our study include a small sample size,
heterogeneous populations with various preparative regi￾mens and acute GVHD prophylactic agents, lack of real
time dose monitoring of maraviroc levels and strict rules
regarding hepatotoxicity leading to frequent discontinuation
of the drug.
In conclusion, maraviroc administration at our proposed
dosing is safe but limited by our study rules regarding
hepatotoxicity in HSCT patients. We advocate close drug
level monitoring in patients receiving maraviroc and
recommend dose adjustments if possible. We also show
that maraviroc when administered until day +30 after
HSCT has a limited role as a novel acute GVHD pro￾phylactic agent for children undergoing HSCT. However,
special considerations could warrant its use in children
with pre-existing colitis, as described in our phase I study
[10]. Future studies investigating the benefits of longer
duration of CCR5 inhibition, with less stringent rules of
drug administration in the face of hepatotoxicity, could
shed further light into its role as a novel acute GVHD
prophylactic agent in children.
