Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, progressive 
cholestatic disease that is associated with inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) in approximately 70% of cases. Although 
the pathogenesis is still unknown for both diseases, there is 
increasing evidence to indicate that they share a common 
underlying predisposition. Herein, we review the epidemiol￾ogy, diagnosis, disease pathogenesis, and specific clinical 
features of the PSC-IBD phenotype. Patients with PSC-IBD 
have a distinct IBD phenotype with an increased incidence 
of pancolitis, backwash ileitis, and rectal sparing. Despite 
often having extensive colonic involvement, these patients 
present with mild intestinal symptoms or are even asymp￾tomatic, which can delay the diagnosis of IBD. Although the 
IBD phenotype has been well characterized in PSC patients, 
the natural history and disease behavior of PSC in PSC-IBD 
patients is less well defined. There is conflicting evidence 
regarding the course of IBD in PSC-IBD patients who receive 
liver transplantation and their risk of recurrent PSC. IBD may 
also be associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarci￾noma in PSC patients. Overall, the PSC-IBD population has 
an increased risk of developing colorectal neoplasia com￾pared to the conventional IBD population. Lifelong annual 
surveillance colonoscopy is currently recommended. (Gut

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic idiopathic 
inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Up to 50% 
of patients may develop extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) 
during their disease course.1
 One such EIM is primary sclerosing 
cholangitis (PSC), described for the first time in 1965.2
 PSC is a 
chronic and progressive cholestatic disease, characterized by in￾flammation and fibrosis of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic 
ducts,3
 that may result in liver cirrhosis and eventually end￾stage liver disease.3
 Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the 
only potentially curative therapy for PSC, with survival rates 
of 85% and 70% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.3
 Without OLT, 
half of symptomatic patients die within 12 to 15 years. 
In Western countries, the reported incidence of PSC is 0.07 to 
1.3 per 105
/yr, and the prevalence is 8.5 to 13.6 per 105
.
4,5 About 
70% of patients with PSC have underlying IBD, most frequently 
ulcerative colitis (UC) in over 75% of cases.6
 The prevalence of 
IBD in PSC patients ranges from 50% to 99% across different 
studies.6
 Several factors could explain this large variation. In a 
recent systematic review, the studies that used both endoscopic 
and histological criteria for IBD diagnosis, showed a higher 
median percentage of IBD among PSC patients.6
 Geographic 
differences could also contribute to this variation. Asian studies 
report a lower prevalence of IBD in PSC patients in comparison 
to European and American populations.7,8 However, in some 
of these studies, IBD diagnosis was established or excluded 
based on registry data or notes in medical files without review￾ing original endoscopy or histology. In fact, a recent Japanese 
report by Sano et al.
9
 using strict case ascertainment criteria 
reported an IBD incidence of 68.9% among PSC patients. Since 
disease activity of IBD in PSC patients is often mild and occa￾sionally asymptomatic, it is important to assure the use of en￾doscopic and histological criteria when assessing IBD incidence 
in this population. Conversely, in patients with known IBD, PSC 
is found much less commonly, occurring in about 2% to 8% of 
UC patients and 3% of Crohn’s disease (CD) cases.6

between PSC and IBD, the two disorders can occur at different 
times. PSC may be diagnosed many years after proctocolectomy 
for colitis, and conversely IBD can appear many years after the 
initial diagnosis of PSC or even after OLT altogether.10 In most 
reports, IBD diagnosis precedes that of PSC.11,12 In a recent re￾port, Sinakos et al.
13 demonstrated an increased frequency of 
PSC being diagnosed first when comparing two time cohorts 
(35% in 1993–1997 vs 50% in 2003–2007, p=0.0009). An in￾herent bias in determining the timing of diagnosis pertains to 
the fact that PSC may have a silent asymptomatic period, and 
equally the IBD associated with PSC may be mildly symptomat￾ic or even asymptomatic, and therefore can go underdiagnosed. 
Since 70% of PSC cases are associated with IBD, the presence of 
CD or UC makes the diagnosis of PSC easier.3
 In patients with 
known IBD, the presence of persistent unexplained cholesta￾sis obliges one to exclude concurrent PSC through magnetic 
resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography, especially if the patient is symptom￾atic for biliary obstruction. When PSC is diagnosed first, half of 
the cases have only abnormal laboratory tests; the typical diag￾nostic hallmarks of fever, itching, and jaundice are rarely seen 
nowadays.3
 Symptomatic patients usually present with fatigue 
and pruritus and can also exhibit jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly 
or scratching injuries. Recurrent episodes of bacterial cholangitis 
with fevers, chills, right upper quadrant pain and jaundice can 
also be a part of the clinical presentation, and usually develops 
in about 10% to 15% of patients during the course of the dis￾ease.14 The diagnosis of PSC is based on the findings of diffuse 
multifocal strictures and dilations in the intrahepatic and/or 
extrahepatic biliary tree.3
 Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of 
PSC should undergo colonoscopy with biopsies to exclude con￾comitant IBD or any malignancy,3
 even if they report no gastro￾intestinal symptoms. As the majority of PSC-IBD patients have 
mild disease activity and even possible normal endoscopic ap￾pearances, histological sampling is crucial to avoid underdiag￾nosis.6
 Although no evidence-based guidelines are available, if 
the index colonoscopy is negative for IBD, a repeat colonoscopy 
every 3 to 5 years should be performed to monitor for possible 
onset of IBD.15
DISEASE PATHOGENESIS
PSC is likely to have an underlying multifactorial etiology, 
with a predominant immune-mediated process.3
 PSC and IBD 
are interrelated conditions that may well share an underlying 
predisposition (Fig. 1). Both diseases share common antibodies, 
such as those directed against cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens 
of neutrophils with a characteristic perinuclear staining pattern 
(p-ANCA). p-ANCA antibodies have been found in 26% to 85% 
of PSC patients and in up to 68% of patients with UC.3
From a genetic standpoint there is increasing evidence that 
PSC is distinct from UC and CD. Large-scale genome-wide as￾sociation studies (GWAS) have identified close to 200 indepen￾dent loci associated with IBD.16,17 Most of these loci are shared 
between UC and CD.16 GWAS studies in PSC have identified a 
total of 16 PSC susceptibility loci.18 In the most recent genetic 
analysis there was surprisingly limited overlap between PSC 
and IBD loci.19 Half of the PSC loci failed to show a robust as￾sociation with IBD, suggesting overlapping yet distinct genetic 
mechanisms.19 Genetic predisposition to autoimmune bile duct 
injury triggered by toxic or infectious agents that may gain 
access through the diseased colon is potentially a major mecha￾nism leading to PSC in IBD patients. 
Two hypotheses that link PSC and IBD include the “gut lym￾Fig. 1. Possible hypothesis linking

phocyte homing” hypothesis and the “leaky gut” hypothesis.20
Activated lymphocytes from the inflamed and permeable gut 
may enter the enterohepatic circulation and persist as memory 
cells that cause hepatic inflammation.21,22 Some molecular fea￾tures, such as chemokines and adhesion molecules, are shared 
by the liver and intestine and could contribute to lymphocyte 
binding at both sites.21 T cells activated in the gut during active 
IBD could differentiate into effector cells with the ability to bind 
to both hepatic and mucosal endothelium. The activation and 
expansion of these memory cells in the liver could eventually 
lead to the induction of MAdCAM-1 and CCL25 in the liver, 
promoting the recruitment of CCR9+ α4β7+
 mucosal T cells and 
the development of inflammation.23 Findings such as PSC de￾velopment after colectomy for IBD, or the development of IBD 
after OLT for PSC, have led some investigators to suggest that 
aberrant homing of lymphocytes between the intestine and liver 
could be involved in the pathogenesis of the PSC-IBD pheno￾type.21
The “leaky gut” hypothesis refers to the association between 
progressive hepatic and biliary injury and increased intestinal 
permeability and translocation of bacterial metabolites from the 
gut.24 The liver receives approximately 75% of its blood sup￾ply from the splanchnic circulation and is constantly exposed 
to both beneficial and noxious molecules from the intestinal 
microbiome.25 This so-called “gut-liver axis” is essential for the 
maintenance of health but may also play an important role in 
pathogenesis of liver and intestinal diseases.25,26 In IBD there is a 
known intestinal microbiome dysbiosis, characterized by lower 
biodiversity and decreased bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum.27
In PSC-IBD patients there is also an altered microbiome compo￾sition, and it appears to be different from IBD-only patients.28,29
Recent evidence suggests a marked increase in Veillonella, 
Escherichia, Lachnospiraceae and Megasphera genera in PSC￾IBD patients.28,29 Other genus such as Prevotella, Roseburia, and 
Bacteroides are significantly reduced.28 This dysbiosis may be 
associated with mucosal immunity dysregulation by modulat￾ing intestinal permeability and altering homing of gut-specific 
lymphocytes.28 Recently, evidence for an etiologic role of the in￾testinal microbiome in PSC has been provided by animal model 
studies. Tabibian et al.
30 used MDR2 knockout mice (a widely 
utilized animal model of PSC) to assess the role of the com￾mensal microbiota in the pathogenesis of biliary injury. Germ￾free MDR2 knockout mice exhibited a dramatically worsened 
PSC phenotype, with exacerbated biochemical and histological 
features and an increase in cholangiocyte senescence.30 Ad￾ditionally the authors found that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), 
which is a commensal microbial metabolite, had an antisenes￾cent effect in an in vitro model.30 These findings demonstrate 
the protective role of commensal microbiota and its metabolites 
against biliary injury and hint at possible new targets for future 
studies of therapeutic interventions in PSC.
The interaction between microbiota and bile acid (BA) metab￾olism may also play an important role in the PSC-IBD pheno￾type. Recent evidence supports the existence of BA dysmetabo￾lism in IBD patients due to impaired microbiota enzymatic 
activity.27 One of the contributing factors for the difference in 
phenotype between PSC-IBD patients and IBD controls may be 
altered concentration and/or composition of colonic BA impact￾ing on gut microbiota and stool BA metabolism.
In summary, PSC-IBD pathogenesis is still unclear but this 
phenotype is likely to have an underlying multifactorial etiol￾ogy, influenced by genetic predisposition, immune-mediated 
processes and altered gut microbiota (Fig. 1).
CLINICAL FEATURES OF PSC-IBD
1. Demographic features of patients with PSC-IBD
Patients with the PSC-IBD phenotype have demographic fea￾tures resembling PSC cases, although the PSC diagnosis tends to 
occur at a younger age, when compared with PSC-only controls 
(mean age, 33.6±17.2 years vs 58.9±18.2 years; p<0.001).9
 The 
incidence is higher in males and is more prevalent in young 
and middle-aged patients.13-15 The age at clinical onset of IBD is 
controversial. Some reports indicate that the mean age for IBD 
diagnosis is higher among PSC-IBD patients compared with IBD 
controls,15 but a recent study reported that PSC-UC patients had 
a UC diagnosis at a significantly earlier age compared with UC 
controls (mean age, 24.5 years vs 33.8 years).31
2. The IBD phenotype of PSC-IBD patients
As stated above, the co-occurrence of PSC with IBD is associ￾ated with a distinct IBD phenotype (Fig. 2). PSC-IBD patients 
typically have mild intestinal disease activity and an increased 
incidence of extensive colitis and pancolitis, rectal sparing and

backwash ileitis (Table 1).9,10,12,13,15,31-38 Extensive colonic involve￾ment, irrespective of the IBD subtype (i.e., CD vs UC), is the pri￾mary IBD phenotype associated with PSC. From a population￾based cohort of 579 PSC patients in the Netherlands, pancolitis 
was observed in 94% of PSC-UC patients and in 96% of PSC￾CD patients.37 Though rare, some patients with ulcerative proc￾titis and Crohn’s ileitis have concomitant PSC.37,39 Although 
pancolitis is a characteristic finding of PSC-IBD patients, it 
occurs at variable rates (35% to 95% of patients).6
 Some cases 
are endoscopically diagnosed as right-sided IBD.11 In a recent 
systematic review, the majority of studies addressing disease ac￾tivity found that the prevalence of inflammation was highest in 
the right colon and lowest toward the distal colon.6,9,12 This pat￾tern of inflammation was significantly different from matched 
non-PSC IBD-controls.6,9,12
The frequency of rectal sparing and backwash ileitis in PSC￾UC patients differs among reports. A recent systematic review 
reported an incidence of rectal sparing from 6% to 66% (versus 
2% to 25% in IBD without PSC) and of backwash ileitis between 
5% and 46% (compared to 3% to 24% in UC without PSC).6
 It 
is worth noting that since PSC-IBD patients typically have qui￾escent disease, microscopic inflammation may still be present 
in spite of an endoscopically normal-appearing rectum.12 The 
frequency of rectal sparing and backwash ileitis should be in￾vestigated in future studies using a consensus definition. 
In PSC-CD patients, the anatomic location of the disease 
differs from patients with isolated CD. Colonic involvement is 
the most often reported (37% to 82%), followed by ileocolic in￾volvement (22% to 58%), and rarely isolated ileal involvement 
(2% to 5%).6
 In PSC-CD patients there is a lower frequency of 
stricturing and penetrating disease compared to patients with 
isolated CD.6,39 
3. IBD disease activity in PSC-IBD patients
Despite the higher prevalence of pancolitis, the intestinal 
inflammation in PSC-IBD patients is usually quiescent lead￾ing to mild symptoms, reduced use of steroids and decreased 
rates of hospitalization.9,10 On histological grounds, the colonic 
inflammation is also very mild, with only focal basal plasmacy￾tosis and occasional mild cryptitis.10 Schaeffer et al.
10 reported 
histological findings of 97 PSC-IBD patients and found no 
evidence of severe disease activity (active cryptitis with crypt 
abscesses, surface erosion or ulceration) in any of the patients. 
In a matched case-control study by Joo et al.,
31 PSC-UC patients 
demonstrated an overall significantly lower grade of inflam￾mation in the colon compared with UC controls (mean grade, 
2.09±0.085 vs 2.59±0.92; p<0.05). Furthermore, there are some 
data to suggest that there is an inverse relationship between PSC 
disease severity and IBD activity. Marelli et al.
35 evaluated 96 
patients with PSC-UC, 52% of whom needed OLT for worsening 
PSC, and compared them with the PSC-IBD group that did not 
need OLT. The PSC-IBD group that needed OLT more frequently 
had clinically quiescent UC, fewer UC flares, and required less 
steroids and immunosuppressives. By contrast, the group where 
OLT was not performed showed an increased need for intestinal 
surgery and more frequent colorectal neoplasia (CRN).35 These 
data suggest that PSC severity may have a “protective” effect on 
UC’s activity.
4. Course of IBD after OLT
There is conflicting evidence regarding the course of IBD 
after OLT for PSC. Several reports demonstrated worsening

colitis activity following OLT in approximately 30% of PSC-IBD 
patients.3
 Furthermore, de-novo IBD after OLT has also been 
reported and it may develop in 14% to 30% of PSC patients 
up to 10 years after transplantation.40 Retrospective studies 
comparing IBD activity before and after liver transplantation 
found that endoscopic colonic inflammation was more fre￾quent after OLT, as was the rate of relapse and overall clinical 
IBD activity.41,42 A retrospective study of 31 patients with PSC￾UC who received OLT, showed that the Mayo score was higher 
after transplantation compared with the pre-transplant score 
(mean score, 2.91±0.9 vs 6.64±3.7; p=0.009).38 The above find￾ings have led to the speculation that the diseased PSC liver 
somehow keeps colonic inflammation in check. Several factors 
may be associated with a worse course of IBD after OLT such 
as a new balance in the immune system favoring an immune￾mediated attack against the colonic mucosa, the presence of 
active IBD at the time of transplantation, discontinuation of 
5-aminosalicylates, infrequent use of azathioprine and the use 
of tacrolimus.35,42 Haagsma et al.
43 proposed that patients treated 
with tacrolimus had a stronger suppression of interleukin-2 pro￾duction by T-cells and that resulted in an inability to activate 
regulatory responses. However, subsequent studies did not con￾firm this suggestion.41,44 Although further studies are required, 
cyclosporine and azathioprine are preferred over tacrolimus 
because they seem to have a more favorable outcome on IBD 
after OLT for PSC.6
 Anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment may 
also be effective and safe for treating IBD in this context.3
 Early 
colectomy should be considered for patients with severe colonic 
inflammation after OLT.38 A recent systematic review, reported a 
colectomy rate after OLT ranging from 4% to 20%.6
Of note, the worsening of IBD after OLT has not been univer￾sally confirmed. Jorgensen et al.
12 performed a cross-sectional 
study in 155 PSC-IBD patients. Forty-two patients (38%) had 
undergone OLT and had a lower clinical and histologic disease 
activity when compared to the nontransplanted cohort. The au￾thors suggested this could be due to the implementation of im￾munosuppressive medication in the transplanted group, namely 
long-term prednisolone therapy that may be a predictor of less 
severe IBD posttransplant.12
5. Course of IBD after proctocolectomy
PSC-IBD patients who undergo proctocolectomy with ileal 
pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) have a higher risk of developing 
pouchitis, which affects 13.8% to 90% of cases (versus 33% in 
patients with conventional IBD).6,13,15 Nonetheless, the long-term 
outcomes are often satisfactory,45 with the incidence of pouch 
failure in PSC-IBD patients subjected to IPAA being similar to 
IBD-only patients.6
 Mathis et al.
45 reported retrospectively on 
100 patients with PSC-UC who underwent IPAA with 6 years of 
follow-up. Pouch failure was observed in only 3% of patients 
due to refractory pouchitis, pouch cancer or fistula formation.45
The mechanism underlying the association between PSC and 
pouchitis remains unclear.
6. The PSC phenotype of PSC-IBD patients
While PSC is often associated with a distinctive IBD phe￾notype,35 the effect of IBD on the natural history and disease 
behavior of PSC is less well defined. In PSC patients with con￾comitant IBD, the PSC phenotype may differ when compared to 
PSC patients without IBD. Combined intrahepatic and extrahe￾patic biliary involvement has been described to be more com￾mon in PSC-IBD patients compared to PSC patients alone (81.5% 
vs 46.2%, p<0.05),46 but has not always been described in the 
literature. At least two other retrospective reviews have refuted 
the finding of a higher prevalence of intra- and extra-hepatic 
biliary involvement in patients with coexisting IBD.47,48
Long-term PSC outcomes also do not seem to be associated 
with the presence or disease severity of IBD. In a natural his￾tory study of 305 Swedish PSC patients, associated IBD had 
no prognostic significance on the need for OLT or liver-related 
deaths.49 Similarly, transplant-free survival rates, cirrhosis rates, 
and mortality of PSC patients were found to be independent 
of concomitant IBD in a retrospective Israeli study of 141 PSC 
patients.48 Navaneethan et al.
47 also concluded that UC did not 
affect the long-term liver outcomes in PSC patients including 
death or need for OLT, after controlling for liver disease severity. 
As corroborative evidence to this study, Ludwig et al.
50 found 
that there were no significant histological differences including 
periductal fibrosis, periductal inflammation, portal edema and 
fibrosis or cholestasis between PSC patients and PSC-UC pa￾tients on liver biopsy specimens. Nevertheless, in a population￾based epidemiologic study of PSC patients from New Zealand, 
PSC-IBD patients when compared to PSC patients were more 
likely to require OLT or die (p=0.03).51
In contrast to the majority of findings reported in the afore￾mentioned studies, some of the PSC-IBD literature suggests that 
the rapidity of PSC disease progression may be contingent upon 
the specific IBD phenotype. A retrospective case-controlled 
study utilizing the Oxford PSC and IBD databases revealed 
that major event-free survival (cancer, OLT or death) was pro￾longed in the PSC-CD group compared to the PSC-UC group 
(Cox regression, p=0.04).39 The authors postulate that this may 
be explained by the increased prevalence of small-duct PSC in 
PSC-CD patients compared to PSC-UC patients, which was also 
suggested by Rasmussen et al.
52 Furthermore, in a retrospective 
review of 240 PSC patients, even large duct PSC-CD patients 
had less liver-related morbidity and mortality compared to PSC￾UC patients and PSC patients without IBD.53
7. The effect of IBD on recurrent PSC post-OLT
PSC recurrence (rPSC) after OLT occurs in 30% to 50% of 
patients, usually 10 years posttransplantation.54 Akin to the 
data available regarding the relationship between IBD and PSC 
disease progression, the presence of concomitant IBD in PSC 

22 Gut and Liver, Vol. 12, No. 1, January 2018
patients has not been unanimously identified as a risk factor for 
rPSC. In a systematic review of autoimmune liver diseases after 
transplantation, there was no statistically significant difference 
in the rate of rPSC in patients with and without IBD.55 In an￾other retrospective analysis of 31 PSC patients who underwent 
OLT, 5-year survival rates, infectious complications, frequency 
of rejection and need for re-transplantation did not differ 
based on whether patients had coexisting IBD.56 Moreover, a 
retrospective analysis of 105 PSC patients who underwent OLT 
revealed no correlation between rPSC and IBD activity.57 On 
the contrary however, in another study PSC patients with UC 
had significantly more rPSC compared to PSC patients without 
UC.58 Several publications have described that an intact colon is 
a strong predictor of rPSC and that colectomy potentially has a 
protective effect against rPSC. In a cohort of 230 PSC patients 
who underwent OLT, colectomy pre- and peri-OLT conferred a 
protective effect against rPSC in the transplanted graft.59 More￾over, an intact colon prior to OLT was the strongest predictor of 
rPSC. Joshi et al.
60 reviewed 110 PSC patients who underwent 
OLT to help understand the impact of IBD on graft survival. Al￾though the mean time to rPSC following OLT and graft survival 
rates were similar between the PSC group and PSC-IBD group, 
multivariable analysis revealed that active IBD at the time of 
OLT was a significant predictor of graft failure. Furthermore, on 
univariate analysis, colectomy pre-OLT was associated with im￾proved graft survival. The authors speculate that decreased graft 
survival in the posttransplant period may be related to cases of 
hepatic artery thrombosis in the context of active IBD. Another 
retrospective study of 59 PSC patients post-OLT found that the 
presence or severity of IBD did not affect patient survival nor 
the incidence of rPSC.41 Furthermore, on multivariable analysis, 
colectomy pretransplant was not associated with rPSC (hazard 
ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 2.51; p=0.207). 
Though colectomy may be beneficial in a subset of PSC-IBD 
patients, concerns regarding operating on decompensated PSC 
patients and the potential for parastomal varices postoperatively 
must be considered.61
8. The effect of IBD on acute cellular rejection post-OLT
Despite opposing evidence on the association of IBD with 
rPSC, data supports that PSC-IBD patients are at risk for a 
greater number of acute cellular rejection (ACR) episodes post￾OLT.62,63 In a retrospective chart review of 55 PSC patients who 
underwent OLT, the incidence of acute rejection was higher in 
PSC-IBD patients compared to PSC patients (27/31 vs 10/24, 
p=0.0006).64 Moreover, PSC-IBD patients who were diagnosed 
with IBD at a younger age were more likely to develop severe 
acute rejection. In spite of the increased incidence of ACR in 
this study, 5-year survival rates and rPSC post-OLT did not vary 
based on the presence of concomitant IBD.
9. Colorectal dysplasia and cancer in PSC-IBD patients
Since its initial description by Broome et al.,
65 plenty of stud￾ies have now confirmed the increased risk of CRN (colorectal 
dysplasia and colorectal cancer [CRC]) in patients with PSC-IBD 
(Table 2).
33,66-78 Even though there are small case series that have 
shown contradictory findings,15,79-83 a large meta-analysis evalu￾ating 13,379 patients with IBD, 1,022 (7.63%) of whom had 
concomitant PSC, showed that there was a 3-fold increased risk 
of CRN and cancer among patients with PSC-IBD compared to 
the IBD-only population (odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95% CI, 2.14 to 
4.90).84 This trend persisted even after evaluating CRC risk alone 
(OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 2.13 to 5.48). In a subgroup analysis, PSC-UC 
patients were found to have a higher risk of both dysplasia (OR, 
2.98; 95% CI, 1.54 to 5.76) and cancer (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.44 
to 6.29) compared to UC-only patients, although there was high 
heterogeneity among the studies. Particularly, the PSC-CD pop￾ulation had a nonstatistically significant higher risk of CRN and 
cancer (OR, 2.32, p=0.133 and OR, 2.91, p=0.388, respectively). 
Interestingly, in one large cohort describing the risk of cancer in 
PSC patients, CRN risk was only increased when IBD was also 
present.85 Some have suggested that the increased risk of CRN 
in PSC-IBD patients could be related to the presence of long￾standing underdiagnosed disease and colonic inflammation.82
This argument has been disputed by some reports describing the 
same duration of IBD in the PSC and non-PSC population in 
patients with CRC.86,87 However, there may be a bias since PSC 
patients may have a subclinical IBD phase, leading to an under￾estimation of the actual burden of disease.88 Most importantly, 
Navaneethan et al.
89 suggested a higher risk in the first 2 years 
after diagnosis of PSC-UC, but did not find any increased risk in 
the subsequent years, which decreases the likelihood that a lon￾ger disease course would increase the CRN risk. There are some 
common features of CRN in PSC-IBD patients: extensive colon 
involvement,90 more frequent CRN in the right colon (proximal 
to the splenic flexure);15,33,72,73,87,91,92 and more frequent bile duct 
dominant stenosis (i.e., extrahepatic bile duct high-grade steno￾sis with obstruction).93
The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of CRN in 
PSC-IBD patients remain unknown. Different authors proposed 
a variety of mechanisms that may be partially responsible for 
this outcome (summarized in Table 3), though these are still 
not conclusive. In rat models, BA have been found to have 
a carcinogenic potential94,95 (specifically secondary BA, like 
deoxycholic acid).96 A different stool BA abundance and/or 
composition could potentially be involved in the right-sided 
CRN risk observed in PSC-IBD,97,98 although this has never been 
demonstrated. Whether the specific dysbiosis that has been 
described in PSC-IBD could be involved in this risk remains 
unknown.99-102 Other mechanisms described include inactiva￾tion of the Farnesoid X receptor pathway,87,103,104 shown to be 
involved in hepatic and colonic inflammation and CRC, and

Table 3. Proposed Mechanisms for the Increased Risk of Colorectal Neoplasia in PSC-IBD Patients
Mechanism Explanation
Genetic Polymorphisms present in TNFα promoter and specific genome associations in proximity to HLA complex on chromosome 
6p21 have been associated with a higher likelihood of developing CRN.
Bile acid Cholestasis favors decreased intestinal BA reabsorption. Microbiota convert primary BA to secondary BA, which have a 
carcinogenic potential.
FXR pathway FX secretion by the intestine is induced by the presence of BA. Normally, FX leads to a decrease in the production of BA 
by the liver. 
Microbiome Gut bacteria are presumed to act on altered BA composition resulting in proinflammatory and procarcinogenic compounds.

polymorphisms in two genes in the chromosome 6p21. A more 
comprehensive understanding of the PSC pathogenesis and the 
involved BA dysmetabolism and microbiota dysbiosis will prob￾ably help to clarify the mechanisms involved in the increased 
CRN risk in these patients.
One would hypothesize that once indefinite or low-grade 
dysplasia (LGD) is diagnosed in PSC-IBD, the rate of progres￾sion to high-grade dysplasia or CRC would be faster than in IBD 
patients. However, while some studies have described the rate of 
progression of indefinite and LGD in IBD-only patients, the rate 
of progression of CRN in patients with PSC-IBD has not been 
thoroughly studied. In a small study with 10 patients, one-third 
of the patients progressed from LGD to advanced neoplasia over 
a mean follow-up of 13±11 months, suggesting a faster rate 
of progression as compared to what has been described in IBD 
alone.105
Since many patients with PSC require OLT,106 some uncer￾tainty exists regarding the effect of the strong immunosuppres￾sive agents in the post-OLT setting, leading to an increased risk 
for CRN versus the “protective” effect of curing the PSC on the 
risk of CRN. Some of the initial studies107,108 showed that there 
was no difference in the rate of CRN in the post-OLT PSC-IBD 
group compared to post-OLT non-IBD/PSC and nontransplanted 
PSC-IBD patients. More recent studies have suggested that there 
may be even a 4-fold greater risk of CRN, though there was no 
evidence of any relevant impact on mortality.109,110 Particularly, 
one study suggested that patients who developed LGD after OLT 
had a slower rate of progression and were less likely to have 
progressive neoplasia or persistent LGD.111
Another subset of the PSC-IBD population who are at risk for 
neoplasia are the patients who have undergone an IPAA, given 
that their increased incidence of pouchitis theoretically leads to 
severe mucosal atrophy and subsequent pouch malignancy.112
Although a small study showed an increased risk of ileal pouch 
dysplasia in PSC-IBD compared to non-IBD and non-PSC popu￾lations separately,113 a larger study that included 65 patients 
suggested a low risk of 5.6% in 5-year for pouch or cuff dyspla￾sia (95% CI, 1.8% to 16.1%).114 Particularly, CRC has been docu￾mented but is extremely uncommon after IPAA.115 There are no 
specific surveillance guidelines for post-IPAA PSC-IBD patients, 
so most experts prefer annual pouchoscopies as standard care 
for PSC patients, even though the risk seems to be low.
Given that the risks of CRN have been widely described in 
the PSC-IBD population, the different gastroenterology societ￾ies have commented on recommendations for surveillance in 
this group. Current recommendations support the use of annual 
colonoscopy and biopsies in PSC-IBD patients from the time of 
PSC diagnosis, without taking into account the duration of IBD 
since it is often not known.116,117 No specific recommendations 
on the management and follow-up of indefinite or LGD exist for 
this high-risk population that may be more prone to be referred 
for colectomy, given the elevated risk of CRC. Hence, further 
studies are needed to better determine the outcomes regarding 
low-grade and indefinite dysplasia in PSC-IBD patients.
UDCA118 has been in the past considered an option in the 
prevention of CRN in PSC-IBD patients. However, studies have 
shown mixed results: some of them with decreased risk of 
CRN,119,120 others not showing any effect in the incidence of 
neoplasia,89,121,122 and others even showing an increased risk 
with high-dose UDCA, usually in the first 6 years after the 
medication was started.123 A meta-analysis in 2013, evaluating 
eight studies with 763 PSC-IBD patients, concluded that there is 
a preventive effect for the development of advanced CRN when 
taking UDCA (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.73), with a more pro￾nounced effect with the 8 to 15 mg/kg/day dose (OR, 0.19; 95% 
CI, 0.08 to 0.49).124 Therefore, while there might be a protective 
effect, more studies are needed to draw more definitive conclu￾sions.
10. Biliary cancer risk in PSC-IBD patients
In a recent large retrospective review of 399 PSC-IBD patients 
from the Mayo Clinic, a prolonged duration of IBD was associ￾ated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in PSC 
patients.125 This increased risk equated to a 33% increased risk 
per 10 years of IBD and the risk was not modified by colectomy. 
Furthermore, in the subset of PSC-IBD patients requiring colec￾tomy, patients who underwent surgery due to colonic neoplasia 
or dysplasia as opposed to refractory disease were also at a sig￾nificantly higher risk of CCA. From an earlier published study 
conducted at Mayo Clinic, although IBD was not associated 
with CCA risk, proctocolectomy was a significant risk factor on 
univariate analysis for the development of CCA in PSC patients 
(relative risk, 4.43).126 It is unclear if the observed elevated can￾cer risk may be secondary to the effect of immunosuppression 
or the severity of intestinal inflammation. 
The increased predisposition to malignant transformation 
may not only apply to the biliary system in PSC-IBD patients. 
From a population-based study in New Zealand, 14 of 60 PSC￾IBD patients developed a malignant complication including 
CRC, hepatocellular carcinoma or CCA whereas none of the 19 
PSC patients without IBD did.51 Nevertheless, in another study 
of 66 PSC patients, the prevalence of malignant complications 
was not dependent on the presence or absence of IBD,46 nor 
did it play a role in a natural history study of 305 Swedish PSC 
patients49 or a long-term single-center study of 200 PSC pa￾tients.127
CONCLUSIONS
IBD affects about 70% of patients with PSC. Although there is 
likely an underlying shared predisposition for PSC and IBD, the 
pathogenesis of these interrelated conditions is still unknown. 
These diseases are likely to be influenced by genetic predisposi￾tion, immune-mediated processes and altered gut microbiota. 

Palmela C, et al: Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Review of the Phenotype 25
Clinically, PSC-IBD patients demonstrate a right-to-left gradi￾ent of colonic inflammation as well as an increased incidence 
of extensive colitis, rectal sparing and backwash ileitis. Despite 
the higher prevalence of pancolitis, the intestinal inflammation 
is usually quiescent leading to mild symptoms, reduced use of 
steroids and decreased rates of hospitalization. Nevertheless, 
post-IPAA, the rates of pouchitis in PSC-UC patients are higher 
compared to non-PSC UC patients. While PSC is associated with 
a distinct IBD phenotype, the effect of IBD on the natural his￾tory and disease behavior of PSC, including recurrent PSC post￾OLT, is less well defined. Overall, the PSC-IBD population has 
an increased risk of developing CRN and CRC compared to the 
IBD-only population. Moreover, IBD may also be also associated 
with an increased risk of CCA in PSC patients. 
In summary, PSC-IBD is a puzzling disease with a very spe￾cial phenotype (Fig. 2); a better understanding of the mecha￾nisms underlying the cross talk between the liver and the gut is 
needed and could lead to the development of new strategies.
