Background: Identifying risk factors for the development of complications of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is
important for setting up treatment criteria.
Aim: To determine risk factors for the development of complications in Asian CHB patients.
Patients and methods: A total of 3233 Chinese CHB patients (mean follow up 46.8 months) were
monitored for liver biochemistry, viral serology, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, acute exacerbation,
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, and development of cirrhotic complications and
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Results: Median age for HBeAg seroconversion and development of complications was 35 years and
57.2 years, respectively. Patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 0.5–1 times the upper limit
of normal (ULN) and 1–26 ULN had an increased risk for the development of complications compared
with patients with ALT levels ,0.56ULN (p,0.0001 for both). HBeAg/antibody to hepatitis B e antigen
status, and number of episodes, duration, and peak ALT levels of acute exacerbations were not associated
with an increased risk of complications. In patients with complications, 43.6% had HBV DNA levels less
than 1.426105 copies/ml. Male sex, stigmata of chronic liver disease, old age, low albumin, and high a
fetoprotein levels on presentation were independently associated with increased cumulative risk of
complications. Male sex, presence of hepatitis symptoms, old age, low albumin level, and presence of
complications on presentation were independently associated with shorter survival.
Conclusion: Prolonged low level viraemia causing insidious and continual liver damage, as reflected by
ALT levels of 0.5–26ULN, is the most likely pathway for the development of complications in Asian CHB
patients.
Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus infection affects more
than 400 million people globally, of whom 75% are
Asians1 2: 25–40% of chronic CHB patients will develop
complications of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC).3 4 Although there have been marked advances in the
therapeutic options for CHB recently, indications for treat￾ment remain controversial. Guidelines from the American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, European
Association of the Study of Liver, and Asian-Pacific
Association of the Study of Liver suggest that treatment
should only be given when there is persistent elevated
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels .2 times normal and
hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels of .105 copies/ml for
both hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive and negative
patients.5–7 However, no study has proved that patients with
values below these arbitrarily defined cut off levels are at a
lower risk for the development of cirrhosis related complica￾tions or HCC. In fact, a recent study by Kim et al in the
general population of Korea found that there was already an
increased risk of mortality from liver disease in patients with
ALT levels in the upper range of normal.8 It is essential that
more evidence for establishing treatment criteria should be
sought, especially as more potent and safe therapeutic agents
will be available in the near future.9 10
The aim of the present large scale study was to examine the
factors determining the development of cirrhosis related
complications and survival in Asian CHB patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
All Chinese CHB patients who were followed up in the
Hepatitis Clinic, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary
Hospital, Hong Kong, during the period from January 1976
to December 2000 were recruited. A total of 346 patients who
already had cirrhosis related complications including ascites,
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), oesophageal varices,
encephalopathy, or HCC (collectively termed as ‘‘complica￾tions’’) on presentation were excluded from the study.
Patients with hepatitis C (n = 25) and hepatitis D (n = 10)
coinfection, a history of significant alcohol consumption
(n = 19), evidence of coexisting autoimmune hepatitis
(n = 4), Wilson’s disease (n = 5), or primary biliary cirrhosis
(n = 5) were also excluded. In addition, 494 patients who
received interferon, lamivudine, or other investigational
modalities for the treatment of CHB were excluded because
these would not represent the natural history of the disease.
The long term outcome of interferon treated patients has
been analysed and published separately.11 All of the studies of
interferon included patients with normal as well as elevated
ALT levels. Their exclusion should not bias the outcome of
our current analysis.
All patients were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen by
micro-particle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA; Abbott
Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois, USA) for at least six months.
HBeAg and antibodies to HBeAg (anti-HBe) (ELISA; Abbott
Laboratories), liver biochemistry, and a fetoprotein (AFP)
were checked every 3–6 months. Continual clinical assess￾ments, including the development of ascites, were carried out

during each follow up. Patients with significant symptoms or
abnormalities in blood tests were recalled and, if necessary,
admitted to hospital. HBV DNA levels were measured by the
Digene Hybrid Capture assay (Digene Corporation,
Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA; lower limit of detection
140 000 copies/ml). In order to determine HBV DNA levels
at relatively low titre, HBV DNA levels of all anti-HBe positive
patients were determined again using a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) based assay (Cobas Amplitor HBV Monitor
Test; Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, New Jersey; lower limit
of detection 200 copies/ml).
Patients with ALT levels that were increased to 1.5 times
the upper limit of normal (ULN) (upper limit: 53 and 31 U/l
for males and females, respectively) were defined as having
exacerbation of chronic HBV infection if other common
causes of ALT elevation were excluded, including other viral
hepatitis, drug induced hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and
steatohepatitis. Peak ALT, peak bilirubin, peak AFP levels,
and duration for each exacerbation were noted.
HBeAg seroconversion was defined as loss of HBeAg with
development of anti-HBe on at least two consecutive follow
up visits.
Ultrasonogram was arranged for patients with elevated
AFP (.20 ng/ml) if ALT was normal and for patients with
persistently elevated AFP even if ALT was raised. Computer
tomography and/or hepatic angiogram was performed if
ultrasound showed suspicion of HCC. For patients with
clinical detection of ascites, splenomegaly, or persistently low
albumin of ,35 g/l, a screening oesophageogastroduodeno￾scopy was performed for detection of oesophageal varices.
The occurrence of complications and survival time were
recorded.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Program for Social Sciences (SPSS 10.0 for Windows; SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Normality of the distribution of
continuous variables was tested by the Komolgorov-Smirnov
test. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous
variables with skewed distribution and the x2 test with Yates’
correction factor or Fisher’s exact test was applied for
categorical variables. Differences in paired parameters were
tested by the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The Kaplan-Meier
method using the log rank test was applied for calculation of
the cumulative risk of development of complications and
survival. The Cox hazard proportional model was used to test
the associations between different variables and the devel￾opment of complications and survival.
RESULTS
Demographics
A total of 3233 HBV patients were recruited. Demographic
data on presentation are shown in table 1. Median and mean
duration of follow up were 29 (range 6–291) months and
46.9 (SD 46.6) months, respectively.
HBeAg seroconversion
Among 1274 patients positive for HBeAg on presentation, 512
patients (40.2%) had HBeAg seroconversion at subsequent
follow up. Median age at HBeAg seroconversion was 35 years
(range 3.6–77.4).
Development of complications
A total of 170 patients (5.3%) developed at least one
complication. The number of patients developing each
complication was as follows: ascites 96 (3.0%) with 30
patients (0.9%) also having SBP, oesophageal varices 59
(1.8%), encephalopathy 40 (1.2%), and HCC 95 (2.9%). Of the
59 patients with oesophageal varices, 15 had clinical
bleeding; the rest were detected by endoscopy. The cumula￾tive risk for the development of complications is shown
in fig 1. By the end of 10 years and 15 years of follow up,
8% and 12% of patients, respectively, had developed
complications.

Median age and HBeAg/anti-HBe status at the time of
development of each complication are shown in table 2;
73.5% of patients were positive for anti-HBe when complica￾tions developed. As this might be related to the higher
prevalence of anti-HBe positivity in the age groups when
complications occurred, patients were stratified according to
age. For patients under 50 years of age, the prevalence of
anti-HBe positivity for patients who developed complications
was significantly higher compared with that of patients with
no complications (73.1% (38/52) v 56.4% (1463/2596),
respectively; p = 0.016). For patients over 50 years of age,
there was no significant difference in anti-HBe positivity
between patients who developed complications and patients
with no complications (73.7% (87/118) v 80.1% (374/467),
respectively; NS).
Factors associated with the development of
complications
Demographics on presentation
Males had a higher cumulative risk for the development of
complications than females (p,0.0001). Patients who devel￾oped complications, compared with patients without com￾plications, were older (median age 55 years (range 19–82) v
38 years (range 1–85); p,0.0001), had a higher chance of the
presence of stigmata of chronic liver disease (p,0.0001), and
were more likely to present with hepatitis symptoms
(p,0.0001).
Liver biochemistry and AFP
Patients who developed complications had significantly lower
median albumin levels, higher median ALT levels, higher
median bilirubin levels, and higher median AFP levels on
presentation compared with patients without complications
(table 3). However, median bilirubin and AFP levels for those
who developed complications were still within normal limits.
To determine the risk for the development of complications
with respect to ALT levels, patients were stratified into five
groups according to ALT levels on presentation: ,0.56 ULN
(n = 714); 0.5–16 ULN (n = 1006); .1–26 ULN (n = 737);
.2–66 ULN (n = 479); and .66 ULN (n = 297). The
cumulative risk for the development of complications was
highest for patients with ALT levels of 1–26 ULN (fig 2). In
addition, patients with ALT levels of 0.5–16ULN already had
a significantly increased risk of complications compared with
patients with ALT levels ,0.56 ULN. The risk of complica￾tions started to decrease for patients with ALT levels of 2–66
ULN and became very low for patients with ALT levels above
66ULN.
The effect of ALT levels during follow up on the cumulative
risk for the development of complications was also calculated
for patients with at least three ALT readings. Patients were
categorised by median ALT levels according to the same
criteria adopted above. As there were only nine patients with
median ALT levels more than 66 ULN, they were grouped
with patients with ALT levels .2–66 ULN. Again, patients
with ALT levels .1–26 ULN had the highest risk for the
development of complications (p,0.0001 and p = 0.0027
compared with patients with ALT ,0.56 ULN and patients
with ALT levels 0.5–16ULN, respectively). Patients with ALT
levels of 0.5–16 ULN also had a higher risk for the
development of complications compared with patients with

ALT levels ,0.56 ULN (p = 0.0071). There were no sig￾nificant differences in the risk for development of complica￾tions when patients with ALT levels .2–66 ULN were
compared with patients with ALT levels ,0.56 ULN and
those with ALT levels 0.5–16ULN.
HBeAg status on presentation
There was no significant difference in the cumulative risk for
the development of complications between HBeAg positive
patients and anti-HBe positive patients (p = 0.12). This was
also true when each type of complication was analysed
separately.
Effect of exacerbation
The effect of exacerbation on the development of complica￾tions was analysed with respect to the number of episodes of
exacerbation, duration of exacerbation, peak ALT levels, and
peak AFP levels. The only significant risk factor was peak
AFP levels of 100 ng/ml or more during or after an
exacerbation (p = 0.0001 compared with patients with AFP
level less than 100 ng/ml) (fig 3).
HBV DNA levels
HBV DNA levels were measured in 2332 patients. Of these,
112 had paired serum samples before and after HBeAg
seroconversion. In addition, 525 HBeAg positive patients and
1695 anti-HBe positive patients had samples at the last follow
up for HBV DNA assays. Details of HBV DNA levels measured
by Digene Hybrid Capture assay are shown in table 4.
Median HBV DNA levels of the 1695 anti-HBe positive
patients, as determined by the Cobas Amplicor HBV Monitor
test, was 7250 copies/ml (range ,200–1.76109
). Only 386
patients (22.8%) had undetectable HBV DNA levels. HBV
DNA levels were ,103
, .103
–104
, .104
–105
, and
.105 copies/ml in 183 (10.8%), 320 (18.9%), 259 (15.3%),
and 547 (32.3%) patients, respectively.
HBV DNA levels were measured in 110 patients with
complications: 21 patients before the complications devel￾oped (range 0.2–8.25 months); nine at the time of the
complications; and 80 after the complications developed
(range 0.41–193.5 months). Median HBV DNA level was
0.3236106 copies/ml (range ,0.142–17006106 copies/ml).
Forty eight patients (43.6%) had HBV DNA levels undetect￾able by the Digene Hybrid Capture assay. The Cobas Amplitor
HBV Monitor test was performed in 45 of these patients.
Thirteen (28.9%) patients had undetectable HBV DNA (that
is, ,200 copies/ml). HBV DNA levels (copies/ml) of the
remaining 32 patients were as follows: ,103 in two patients
(4.4%); .103
–104 in 12 patients (26.7%); .104
–105 in 10
patients (22.2%); and .105 in eight patients (17.8%).
Independent factors associated with development of
complications and poor survival
Using the Cox proportional hazards model, male sex
(p,0.0001), presence of stigmata of chronic liver disease
(p = 0.045), increasing age (p,0.0001), low albumin level on
presentation (p,0.0001), and high AFP level on presentation
(p = 0.001) were found to be independent factors associated
with a higher cumulative risk for the development of
complications.
For survival analysis, male sex (p = 0.004), presence of
hepatitis symptoms (p = 0.02), increasing age (p,0.0001),
and low albumin level on presentation (p,0.0001) were
found to be independent factors associated with a shorter
actuarial survival.
DISCUSSION
The present study was limited by the relatively short period of
follow up even though 307 patients (10.0%) were followed up
for more than 10 years. Another limitation of the study was
the absence of histological assessment. However, the end
points of our study, the development of cirrhosis related
complications and HCC, are of great clinical and prognostic
relevance.
Several findings from the present study have direct
implications for criteria for the treatment of CHB in the
future. Firstly, the risk of complications increased as ALT
levels on presentation increased from .0.56ULN to 26ULN.
In contrast, patients with ALT levels above 66 ULN had a
significantly lower risk for the development of complications
(fig 2). These findings were confirmed using median ALT
levels of patients during subsequent follow up. Acute
exacerbations and high ALT levels (for example, .26 ULN)
probably signify acute injuries to the liver which may not lead
to permanent damage. This is probably analogous to the
situation in acute viral hepatitis. However, in patients with
only mild elevation of ALT, including those with ALT levels in
the upper range of normal, the immune attack on the liver
might be more insidious and chronic, leading eventually to
more severe and permanent damage.
In the study of Kim et al showing an increased risk of
mortality from liver disease in patients with ALT levels in the
upper range of normal, it was suggested that the normal
range of serum aminotransferase concentrations should be
lowered in populations in which liver disease are common.8
Even though the authors did not test their subjects for
hepatitis B or C markers, their findings confirm ours. The
present guidelines for treatment suggest that only patients
with ALT levels .26 ULN should be treated.5–7 This would
exclude patients with the highest risks for the development
of complications from treatment.
Secondly, in the Asian population, disease activity con￾tinues to progress in a proportion of patients after HBeAg
seroconversion. Median age for the development of compli￾cations in our patients was 57.2 years (table 2). Median age
of HBeAg seroconversion was 35 years. More than two thirds
of the patients were already anti-HBe positive when they
developed complications. The cumulative risk for the devel￾opment of complications was comparable between patients
positive for HBeAg and for anti-HBe on presentation. A
Taiwan study by Yang et al. claimed that HBeAg positivity was
associated with an increased risk of HCC.12 HBeAg status of

the patients in this study however was checked only at the
time of enrolment whereas the development of HCC was
observed during the subsequent 10 years of follow up.
HBeAg/anti-HBe status at the time of development of HCC
was not assessed. This study therefore can provide no clue as
to the HBeAg status of patients at the time of HCC
development. Another smaller Taiwan study found that
although HBeAg seroconversion confers a favourable out￾come in some patients, active hepatitis can occur after HBeAg
seroconversion, leading to cirrhosis and HCC.13 McMahon et
al, in their study, found that ‘‘seroconversion from HBeAg to
anti-HBe, and even loss of hepatitis B surface antigen, did not
protect patients from development of hepatocellular carci￾noma’’.14 These latter two studies confirm the findings of the
present study, that the majority of cirrhosis related complica￾tions and HCC develop after HBeAg seroconversion. The
onset of cirrhosis occurs during the prolonged process of
HBeAg seroconversion in Asian patients.15 Cirrhosis will con￾tinue to worsen or develop after HBeAg seroconversion.16–18
Thus HBeAg seroconversion should only be regarded as a step
towards viral suppression, and therapy may need to be
continued after HBeAg seroconversion.
Thirdly, progression of cirrhosis is more likely to be related
to the low level of viraemia in a large proportion of patients
who are anti-HBe positive. In the current study, only 22.8% of
anti-HBe patients had undetectable HBV DNA levels by the
PCR based assay; 32.3% had more than 105 copies/ml. (That
the wild-type virus is as likely to cause complications as the
precore mutants have been analysed in a separate study19.)
Among the 56% of patients with complications in whom
HBV DNA levels were undetectable by the Digene Hybrid
Capture assay, over 70% had HBV DNA levels detectable by
the Amplicor HBV Monitor test. Twenty nine per cent of
patients had undetectable HBV DNA (that is, ,200 copies/
ml). This is evidence against the proposal that disease
progression is unlikely once HBV DNA levels become less
than 105 copies/ml.20 Our findings support the conclusion of
Chu and colleagues21 that there is no cut off HBV DNA value
for differentiating active from inactive disease in HBeAg
negative patients. This implies that prolonged and maximal
suppression of HBV DNA to levels below the detection limit
of PCR based assays may be necessary to reduce the risk of
complications.
In conclusion, prolonged low level viraemia causing
insidious and continual liver damage, as reflected by
relatively mild elevations in ALT levels, is the most likely
pathway leading to the development of complications for
Asian patients with CHB. Long term antiviral therapy aiming
at maximal suppression of HBV even after HBeAg serocon￾version may be required for Asian patients.
