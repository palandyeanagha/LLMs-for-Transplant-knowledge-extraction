Abstract
Background: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare neurovisceral disease characterized by progressive
neurodegeneration and premature death. We report data recorded at enrolment in an ongoing international NP-C
registry initiated in September 2009 to describe disease natural history, clinical course and treatment experience of
NP-C patients in clinical practice settings.
Methods: The NPC Registry is a prospective observational cohort study. Participating sites are encouraged to
evaluate all consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NP-C, regardless of their treatment status. All
patients undergo clinical assessments and medical care as determined by their physicians. Data are collected
through a secure internet-based data collection system.
Results: As of 19th March, 2012, 163 patients have been enrolled in centres across 14 European countries, Australia,
Brazil and Canada. The mean (SD) age at enrolment was 19.6 (13.0) years. In general there was a long lag time
between the mean (SD) age at neurological onset (10.9 (9.8) years) and age at diagnosis (15.0 (12.2) years). Among
all enrolled patients, 107 were diagnosed based on combined genetic testing and filipin staining. Sixteen (11%) out
of 145 patients with available age-at-neurological-onset data had early-infantile neurological onset, 45 (31%) had
late-infantile onset; 45 (31%) had juvenile onset and 39 (27%) had adolescent/adult onset. The frequencies of
neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly during infancy were greatest among early-infantile patients,
and decreased with increasing age at neurological onset. The most frequent neurological manifestations were:
ataxia (70%), vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (VSGP; 70%), dysarthria (66%), cognitive impairment (62%), dysphagia
(52%). There were no notable differences in composite NP-C disability scores between age-at-neurological-onset
groups. Miglustat therapy at enrolment was recorded in 117/163 (72%) patients.
Conclusions: Approximately two-thirds of this NP-C cohort had infantile or juvenile onset of neurological
manifestations, while the remaining third presented in adolescence or adulthood. While systemic symptoms were
most common among patients with early-childhood onset disease, they were also common among patients with
adolescent/adult onset. The profiles of neurological manifestations in this Registry were in line with previous
publications.

Background
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare neurovisc￾eral disease characterized by progressive neurodegenera￾tion and premature death, with an estimated incidence at
diagnosis of 1:100,000–120,000 live births [1,2]. NP-C is
caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the NPC1 gene
(in 95% of cases) or the NPC2 gene, leading to severely
impaired intracellular lipid transport and accumulation of
unesterified cholesterol, sphingosine and a range of glyco￾sphingolipids in various tissues, including the brain [3,4].
Advances in knowledge regarding the underlying bio￾chemical disease pathways in NP-C over the last 20 years,
such as the discovery of cholesterol storage abnormalities
and characterisation of causal gene mutations, have led to
increasing awareness of the disease among physicians and
a large number of new diagnoses. In turn, the broad clin￾ical heterogeneity of NP-C has become increasingly recog￾nised based on several observational studies [2,5-9].
Clinical presentations of NP-C feature a range of sys￾temic and neurological signs that are not specific to the
disease, arise at different ages, and progress at different
rates [1,2,5,6,9,10]. Very early-onset patients are often diag￾nosed based on isolated systemic manifestations [11,12],
but patients most often present during childhood with one
or more neurological manifestations such as saccadic eye
movement abnormalities, cerebellar ataxia, learning pro￾blems and clumsiness [1,9,10]. Increasing numbers of
patients with adolescent/adult onset of neurological disease
are also being detected and diagnosed [13-15].
Recent large cohort studies have shown that catego￾rization of patients according to age at onset of neurological
manifestations is useful for the evaluation of disease course
and responses to therapy, and helps in clinical disease man￾agement and genetic counselling [1,2,6,10,16]. In addition,
the establishment of disease-specific disability scales and
their application in a number of observational studies has
allowed more objective, semi-quantitative assessments of
neurological disease progression and response to therapy
[6,16-18].
A variety of symptomatic treatments can alleviate the
neurological manifestations of NP-C [19], and the appro￾priate application of such therapies can have an import￾ant influence on patient quality of life [10]. Miglustat
(ZavescaW; Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd) is currently the
only disease-specific therapy for the treatment of progres￾sive neurological manifestations in children and adults
with NP-C [20]. Miglustat was approved in Europe in
2009, and has since been approved in a number of other
countries. As a result, clinical experience with this drug is
increasing [7,8,16,21].
Here, we report data from an ongoing international NP￾C registry, which was initiated to describe the natural his￾tory, disease course, clinical outcomes and treatment
experience of NP-C patients in clinical practice settings.
The NPC Registry enrols patients regardless of their treat￾ment status, although a large proportion is receiving
miglustat. As such, the Registry forms part of the post￾marketing surveillance for miglustat. Patient and disease
characteristics at enrolment in all patients included in the
Registry as of 19th March, 2012 are summarised.
Methods
Study design and population
The NPC Registry is an international, prospective observa￾tional cohort study. All patients with a confirmed diag￾nosis of NP-C are eligible for entry regardless of their
treatment status. Participating sites are encouraged to
evaluate all consecutive NP-C patients (both incident and
prevalent) attending outpatient and/or inpatient visits.
Patients included in the Registry undergo clinical assess￾ments and medical care as determined by their physicians.
Data collection and assessments
Data on the demographics, diagnosis, disease character￾istics and treatment of patients from clinical practice set￾tings are entered through a secure, internet-based data
collection system. Data are only recorded from visits
that take place after all necessary study-specific and site￾specific approvals as well as written informed consent
were received. Before entering any visit data, written
informed consent was obtained from all patients (includ￾ing children) and/or their legal guardians.
Data collected include information from assessments that
are routinely performed for NP-C patients in clinical prac￾tice: demographics, diagnostic tests and findings, medica￾tions (including miglustat exposure), non-drug therapies,
growth characteristics, neurological manifestations, func￾tional disability. Physicians are also encouraged to enter
data on the medical history, general physical status of
patients and findings from other assessments performed:
organ volumes, ears and eyes examinations, laboratory
findings, and neuroimaging.
Patient functional disability status is evaluated using a
disease-specific disability scale that assesses four key
domains of neurological disease in NP-C [6,18]. Briefly,
ambulation is assigned a rating on a five-point scale ran￾ging from normal to wheelchair-bound. Manipulation is
rated on a four-point scale from normal to severe dysme￾tria/dystonia. Language function is rated on a five-point
scale from normal to absence of communication, and
swallowing is rated a four-point scale from normal to gas￾tric button feeding. Based on these ratings, each functional
domain was assigned a score ranging from 0 (best) to 1
(worst) to provide equal weighting across all domains.
An independent Scientific Committee advises on med￾ical and scientific aspects of the Registry. For data quality
assurance, the data collection system keeps an audit trail
of all entries and changes, and performs data checks of

both data range and plausibility. In addition, the study
database is also periodically reviewed for missing data and
incomplete information.
Data analysis
This analysis summarises patient data recorded at enrol￾ment, which includes information from clinical assess￾ments as outlined above, as well as relevant data from
patient histories based on their medical records. Age at
diagnosis, age at neurological disease onset, time since
diagnosis, treatment exposure time and disease severity
are also provided. Patient ages at diagnosis are calculated
based on the date at which the first positive genetic and/
or positive filipin staining test results were reported.
NP-C disability scale analyses were based on scores for
all four functional domains as well as a composite score,
which is calculated as the mean of all four domain scores
[18]. Disability scale data and other relevant patient/disease
characteristics were stratified by age at onset of neuro￾logical manifestations according to previously published
age categories: early-infantile onset (<2 years), late-infantile
onset (2 to <6 years), juvenile onset (6 to <15 years), and
adolescent/adult onset (≥15 years) [1,2,6,10]. Due to the
limited number of cases (n = 3), pre/peri-natal patients
(aged between 0 and 3 months) were merged with the
early-infantile onset category.
Analyses of data at enrolment are purely descriptive in
nature. Continuous variables are summarised using de￾scriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation
(SD), median, range and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
of the mean. Categorical variables are summarised using
counts and percentages. By nature, this is an observed
cases analysis, with all summary statistics and percen￾tages calculated relative to number of patients with
available data. In the following sections, the denomina￾tors for analysis were the numbers of patients with the
corresponding data available; different parameters have
different denominators.

neurological onset data (N = 145), 16 (11%) had the
early-infantile onset form, 45 (31%) had late-infantile
onset; 45 (31%) had juvenile onset and 39 (27%) had
adolescent/adult onset. Three patients in the early
infantile-onset group presented with perinatal hypotonia.
Information regarding neurological manifestations was
missing for 12 patients.
Forty-two patients had ‘psychiatric’ manifestations at
enrolment. The proportion of adolescent/adult-onset
patients among this subgroup was higher (16/40 [40%])
than those in the earlier-onset categories (3–30%).
Five patients had no neurological manifestations recorded
prior to or at enrolment (Table 1). All five had a confirmed
biochemical diagnosis based on filipin staining, among
which three were also shown to carry NPC1 mutations.
All five patients had visceral involvement at enrolment;
histories of neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly and/or spleno￾megaly during infancy were recorded in two patients each.
One adult male patient (current age 43 years; enrolled
at age 41 years), who displayed only hepatosplenomegaly
at enrolment was diagnosed aged 37 years based on
positive filipin staining. No genetic testing results were
available and cholesterol esterification was not assessed.
This patient did not have a history of visceral manifesta￾tions during infancy.
Diagnosis
Among all 163 enrolled patients, 107 had an NP-C diag￾nosis established by combined genetic testing and filipin
staining, 39 by genetic testing alone and 14 by filipin
staining alone. Documentation related to diagnostic test
results was missing for three patients.

Filipin staining was recorded as having been performed
in 121 out of 140 patients with available data (86%). The
filipin test gave positive results for 113 patients. Results
were reported as negative in two patients, one with
juvenile-onset (aged 6.9 years) and one with adolescent/
adult-onset of neurological manifestations (aged 17.9 years),
although both of these patients had disease-causing NPC1
gene mutations. Filipin staining results were not known for
six patients.
Gene mutation analysis was recorded as having been
performed in 146 out of 154 patients with available data
(95%). Of the 137 patients with available genetic results,
134 had NPC1 mutations and three had NPC2 mutations.
Results from genetic testing were not known for nine
patients.
Findings from LDL-induced cholesteryl ester formation
assays were recorded in 63 out of 120 patients with avail￾able data (53%). Among these, 56 patients had a reduced
rate of cholesteryl ester formation. Five patients had a nor￾mal rate: one patient (aged 5 years) had missing age￾at-onset data but did have neurological manifestations at
enrolment; one (aged 9 years) had no neurological mani￾festations; two had juvenile neurological onset; one had
adult neurological onset.
Patient age milestones
In general there was a long lag time between the mean
(SD) age at neurological onset (10.9 (9.8) years; range 0–
48 years) and age at diagnosis (15.0 (12.2) years; range
0.1–53.9 years) (Table 1). This period appeared longer
among adolescent/adult-onset patients compared with
the early-, late- and juvenile-onset groups.
Eight out of 16 (50%) early-infantile onset patients were
diagnosed with NP-C before the appearance of neuro￾logical manifestations. Most (72–95%) late-infantile, ju￾venile and adolescent/adult-onset patients were diagnosed
after neurological onset.
Systemic manifestations
Data on patient histories of neonatal jaundice, hepato￾megaly and/or splenomegaly during infancy are sum￾marised in Figure 2. The overall proportions of these
systemic manifestations were: neonatal jaundice during in￾fancy (49/126; 39%); hepatomegaly during infancy (50/127;
39%); splenomegaly (69/127; 54%). The prevalence of neo￾natal jaundice, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly during
infancy was particularly high among early-infantile onset
patients, and decreased with increasing age at neurological
onset. Nevertheless, 21% of adolescent/adult-onset patients
had a history of neonatal jaundice and 30% had hepatosple￾nomegaly during infancy.
Overall, a history of hepatic failure during the neonatal
period was recorded in 7/120 (6%) patients. Hepatic fail￾ure was recorded as having resolved in six of these cases.
Systemic outcome data were missing for the remaining
patient.
Neurological manifestations
Based on medical data recorded prior to patients’ enrol￾ment in the Registry, the most frequent neurological
manifestations among all those with available data (N =
138) were: ataxia (70%), vertical supranuclear gaze palsy
(VSGP; 70%), dysarthria (66%), cognitive impairment
(62%), dysphagia (52%), dystonia (46%), seizures (33%),
and cataplexy (26%).
The profiles of neurological manifestations according
to age-at-neurological-onset category are summarised in
Figure 3. Ataxia and VSGP were both recorded in over
70% of late-infantile, juvenile and adolescent/adult-onset,
and dysarthria in >60% of patients in these age categor￾ies. The prevalence of cognitive impairment (recoded as
‘delayed development’ in very young patients) was con￾sistently high across all age groups (60–70%). Dysphagia
was also a consistent finding in approximately 50% of all
age categories. Seizures and cataplexy were more often
recorded among late-infantile/juvenile onset patients

(37–57%) compared with early-infantile onset (17%) and
adolescent/adult-onset patients (6–9%).
Disability score
A categorical analysis of scores for individual disability
scale parameters by age at neurological onset group is
summarised in Figure 4. Across all age-at-onset categor￾ies, more patients were categorised as having severe
impairments in ambulation and manipulation than in
language and swallowing. Severe impairments in lan￾guage and swallowing were more common in early￾infantile and late-infantile onset patients compared with
juvenile and adolescent/adult-onset patients.
Among all patients, means (SD [95% CIs of the mean])
for individual disability domain scores were 0.42 (0.35
[0.36, 0.48]) for ambulation, 0.48 (0.35 [0.42, 0.54]) for
manipulation, 0.35 (0.26 [0.31, 0.39]) for language and
0.37 (0.33 [0.32, 0.43]) for swallowing.
Mean (SD) composite disability scores were 0.40 (0.35)
in early-infantile onset patients, 0.41 (0.30) in late￾infantile onset patients, 0.47 in juvenile-onset patients
and 0.35 (0.20) in adolescent/adult-onset patients. The
95% CIs of the mean scores in these patient groups over￾lapped across all age categories, indicating no notable
differences between patients based on age at neuro￾logical onset (Table 2).
Miglustat exposure
A total of 117/163 (72%) patients were recorded as being
treated with miglustat therapy at enrolment. The mean
(SD) duration of exposure to miglustat was 1.78 (1.88)
years (median 1.13; range 0–7.73 years). Individual patient
disease and treatment timelines indicated that the period
from diagnosis to initiation of miglustat therapy was
highly variable across all age-at-onset groups (Figure 1).
A total of 10 patients with neurological manifestations
of NP-C were treated before having a confirmed diag￾nostic test result (excluding patients with missing test
dates). Some cases were treated based on sibling disease
history, and others were treated from the time physi￾cians requested confirmatory diagnostic tests (already
having a high suspicion for NP-C based on the overall
clinical picture).
Four patients were treated before the onset of neuro￾logical manifestations, and at the time of enrolment in the
Registry, three had developed neurological manifestations.
One patient had early-infantile onset of neurological man￾ifestations and was aged 0.8 years at miglustat start, two
had late infantile-onset and were aged 2.1 and 5.3 years at
miglustat start, and one had adolescent/adult-onset and
was aged 16.3 years at miglustat start. The time period
from the start of miglustat therapy to onset of neurological
manifestations in these patients ranged from approxi￾mately 5 months to approximately 17 months. All four
patients had confirmed diagnoses based on genetic testing;
one patient also had a positive filipin staining result.
Discussion
These observations come from an international registry
population of 163 patients, which represents the largest
cohort of living NP-C patients reported to date. As such,
the findings reported in this paper provide an important
contribution to existing knowledge regarding both disease
and patient characteristics. This Registry population also
comprises appreciable numbers of patients across all
age-at-neurological-onset categories (early-infantile, late￾infantile, juvenile and adolescent/adult). Notably, adoles￾cent/adult onset patients make up almost one-third of
the Registry population.
As has been reported in previous NP-C patient cohorts,
a high proportion of early-infantile and late-infantile onset

patients had a history of neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly
and/or splenomegaly [2,9]. This confirms the importance
of these symptoms as tangible clues toward a possible
diagnosis of NP-C in new-borns, although it should be
borne in mind that they are often transient manifestations
[11,12].
Interestingly, a notable proportion of adolescent/adult￾onset patients in the NPC Registry also had a record of
neonatal jaundice and/or hepatosplenomegaly during in￾fancy. Despite memory bias, hepatosplenomegaly in older￾onset patients often goes unrecognised [15]. Abdominal
ultrasound examination and/or a detailed investigation of
patients’ medical histories with regard to previous liver
disease may help to detect systemic NP-C symptoms dur￾ing diagnostic work up in adolescent/adult cases [10,22].
The profile of neurological symptoms in this Registry
was consistent with data from previous large cohort
studies [2,5,6,9]. In particular, VSGP was confirmed as a
frequent finding across all age-at-onset categories. Sac￾cadic eye movement abnormalities are known to be one
of the earliest specific signs of neurological deterioration
in NP-C, progressing over time to full VSGP in most

cases [10,23,24]. These data therefore support existing
knowledge and underline the importance of systematic
examination of saccades and vergence movements as
well as pursuit movements in the detection of possible
NP-C [10,25-27].
The common occurrence of cataplexy and seizures in
late-infantile and juvenile-onset NP-C patients, with lower
levels seen in early-infantile and adolescent/adult-onset
patients, is also in close agreement with existing reports
[2,10]. These manifestations impair patient quality of life
and in some severe cases, prognosis. Treatment directed
toward achieving adequate control of cataplexy and sei￾zures is essential [10].
Cognitive impairment was one of the most consistent
neurological findings, reported in 60–70% of patients across
all age-at-onset categories. While progressive cognitive de￾cline eventually affects most, if not all, patients with NP-C,
it is generally less commonly recognised during early child￾hood. Impaired cognition frequently manifests as poor
school performance in juveniles and adolescents, and as
NP-C progresses patients experience a general decline,
leading to frank dementia in many cases [10,15,28,29]. In
younger-onset patients it is more likely to be recognised ini￾tially as developmental delay [5].
Similar to cognitive decline, previous studies have
reported psychiatric manifestations more frequently
among adolescent/adult-onset NP-C patients compared
with younger-onset patients [2,14,15]. In the Registry
population 40% of adolescent/adult-onset patients had
psychiatric manifestations, although this value might
have been artificially high due to ‘cognitive decline’ hav￾ing been recorded as a psychiatric manifestation; this was
certainly the case in the early- and late-infantile groups.
Nevertheless, schizophrenia-like psychosis has previously
been reported in up to 25% of NP-C patients, and other
major psychiatric illnesses reported in association with
NP-C include depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive￾compulsive disorder [10]. The frequency of NP-C in
patients diagnosed with psychiatric disorders is an import￾ant aspect because in some patients, psychiatric manifesta￾tions can overshadow systemic symptoms and subtle
neurological signs of NP-C, which leads to significant
delays in the detection and diagnosis of NP-C [30,31].
Studies are currently ongoing to further establish the fre￾quency of NP-C among psychiatric patients [32].
Analysis of patient age milestones illustrated that early￾infantile patients have a greater tendency to be diagnosed
before the onset of neurological manifestations compared
with late-infantile, juvenile and adolescent/adult-onset
patients, who are diagnosed after neurological onset. This
is likely due to the greater prominence of systemic symp￾toms in very young patients. Overall, there were long
delays between the onset of neurological manifestations
and confirmation of the diagnosis of NP-C. This finding is
consistent with data from previous studies [10,18,33], and
highlights this major problem in NP-C.
Delayed diagnosis can have a considerable impact on
quality of life for patients and/or their family and pri￾mary caregivers. In addition, it has been recommended
that disease-specific therapy with miglustat should be
started as early as possible in the course of neurological
disease in order to stabilise neurological function [1,10].
Possible measures that might enhance the detection of
NP-C and expedite future diagnoses include the use of
novel screening tools such as the NP-C suspicion index
[27], increased vigilance for early systemic symptoms,
and the development of potential new disease biomar￾kers such as plasma oxysterols [34].
The composite disability scores among patients in the
Registry at enrolment were comparable with baseline
scores reported in previous cohort studies that utilised
this disability scale [7,18,35]. It is notable that there were
no significant differences in composite scores between
age-at-onset categories among the Registry patients. The
95% CIs of the mean composite scores all overlapped. It
also remains to be seen whether changes in composite
scores over time in this Registry reflect previously
observed differences in the rates of disease progression
between the age-at-onset categories.
It is not possible to state whether any single disability
scale measure (ambulation, manipulation, language or
swallowing) was statistically more affected than others at
enrolment based on the current categorical analysis.
However, the distribution of scores for each disability
parameter in the Registry appeared comparable with
those seen at baseline during a previous cohort study
based on the same disability scale [18].
The data summarised in this report should be inter￾preted with the awareness that disease registries come with
a number of inherent limitations. As with all disease regis￾tries, the integrity and comparability of the NPC Registry
data relies on the accurate entry of patient information by
the treating physicians and other nominated staff at each
participating centre. The potential for ascertainment bias
(also present to some extent in all published NP-C cohorts)
should be recognised. Registries can also suffer from selec￾tion bias. In the former case, the inclusion of all consecu￾tive patients (both incident and prevalent) who present for
outpatient and/or inpatient visits irrespective of treatment
status is one measure stipulated in the NPC Registry proto￾col to minimise selection bias. Finally, most patients with a
confirmed diagnosis of NP-C are currently being treated
with miglustat, and there are only a few treatment-naïve
patients available for study within the Registry population.
At this point in time, this precludes meaningful compari￾sons between treated and untreated patients.
In summary, these data derived from the largest NP-C
Registry cohort reported to date, provide a useful overall

snapshot of patient and disease characteristics that can
be considered alongside epidemiological data from pre￾vious large cohort studies. Our findings confirm that
systemic symptoms are common among patients with
early-childhood onset of neurological manifestations but
are also a common finding among patients with adoles￾cent/adult onset disease. The profiles of neurological mani￾festations seen among all age-at-onset categories in the
Registry are in line with previous publications. Longitu￾dinal data from follow up assessments are required to dis￾cern any differences in disease progression and degrees of
neurological stability between early-infantile, late-infantile,
juvenile and adolescent/adult-onset groups, and will be
reported in future publications.
