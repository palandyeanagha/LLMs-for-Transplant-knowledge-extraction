Abstract
The World Society of Emergency Surgery promotes training and continuing medical education in the field of
emergency surgery and trauma. One of the most important activities of the society is the development of
guidelines. The debate about the process of developing and updating guidelines is very active with no clear
consensus and different policies among scientific societies. The present commentary provides the position of the
World Society of Emergency Surgery on guideline development process and their update.
Keywords: Guidelines, Evidence-based medicine, Guideline development, Guideline update, WSES
Background
The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) was
established in 2007 with the aim to promote training
and continuing medical education in emergency general
surgery and trauma.
Since then, great effort was made in that direction:
six world congresses with vast international attend￾ance took place and several international educational
meetings were initiated as well as numerous educa￾tional courses in different fields of trauma and emer￾gency surgery were conducted and above all, WSES
launched and curated several clinical guidelines for
emergency and trauma surgery [1, 2].
Some guidelines have already been updated, and
others will be updated in the near future.
Main text
The debate about the clinical guideline updating process
is very animated with many scientific societies facing this
problem. No consensus on update timing is acceptable
by all [3, 4].
No clear agreement exists about the timing and meth￾odology for guideline updates. Some authors advocate
updates every 2–5 years, and some advocate an update
only when relevant evidences are available or recom￾mendations become outdated [5–7].
Generally strong recommendations last longer
Are our recommendations really strong?
The relationship between emergency surgery and
evidence-based medicine unfortunately at the moment is
a troubled story. Good-quality evidence is frequently
lacking in emergency surgery, and the difficulty to con￾duct randomized trials in emergency settings is well doc￾umented [8–10].
In this context, the quality of existing evidences is
poor and based mainly on retrospective and observa￾tional studies; therefore, the strength of recommenda￾tions is often weak, based more on the plausibility that
even a well-designed study will not change the clinical
practice rather than on the results of randomized trials.
Moreover, the development of clinical guidelines is an
extremely complex process that involves laborious work
and involvement of an international panel of experts and
needs months of work of reviewing the literature, medi￾ating several points of view, and experts’ opinions. In the
absence of solid and strong evidences, like in emergency
surgery, this process becomes harder.
At the light of these considerations, and in order to
avoid a waste of time in producing duplicate guidelines

with similar recommendations, the WSES board has de￾cided to adopt a new policy and recommendations.
 WSES requires a good-quality standard for guide￾lines; the development of guidelines should be per￾formed according to the AGREE II requirements
adopting the GRADE methodology for evidence
evaluation and grading [11, 12].
 For each guideline topic, WSES will appoint a
committee with a coordinator that will be
nominated by WSES board who will be in charge of
the continuous monitoring of new evidences
available about the topic
 The nominated committee will be responsible to
add, on a dedicated area in the WSES website,
all the relevant updates and new studies. The
committee will have to notify and propose to the
WSES board the need for guideline updating.
WSES will continue to promote a scientific approach
to emergency and trauma surgery and to support the ad￾vance of clinical studies such the International Register
of Open Abdomen (IROA), the International Register of
Emergency Surgery (WIRES), and the ongoing COOL
study [13, 14] in order to obtain good-quality evidence
and the development of a better quality evidence-based
approach in the daily practice.
Conclusion
WSES guidelines will be developed according to high￾quality standards; a dedicated committee, nominated by
the WSES board, will be responsible for the continuous
evaluation of new evidences. The development of an up￾dated version of guidelines will be promoted and evalu￾ated by the WSES board in case of important changes
and new evidences available.
