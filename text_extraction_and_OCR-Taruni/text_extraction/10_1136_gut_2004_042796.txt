Background and aims: Splanchnic vein thrombosis is a significant source of complications in candidates
for liver transplantation. The aims of this study were: (a) to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for
splanchnic vein thrombosis in cirrhotic patients awaiting transplantation and (b) to assess the usefulness of
anticoagulation.
Methods: A total of 251 cirrhotic patients listed for transplantation were analysed. All underwent
systematic screening for thrombosis with Doppler ultrasonography. During the second period of the study,
all patients with thrombosis received anticoagulation up to transplantation while during the first period
none had received anticoagulation.
Results: The incidence of splanchnic vein thrombosis at evaluation was 8.4%. Seventeen additional
patients (7.4%) developed de novo thrombosis after evaluation. Independent risk factors for thrombosis
were low platelet count (77.4 (36.3) v 111.6 (69.2) 109
/l; p = 0.001), a past history of variceal bleeding
(47.4% v 29.1%; p = 0.003), and a prolonged interval from listing to transplantation (8.5 (6.8) v 4.8
(4.4) months; p = 0.002). The proportion of partial or complete recanalisation was significantly higher in
those who received (8/19) than in those who did not receive (0/10, p = 0.002) anticoagulation. Survival
was significantly lower in those who had complete portal vein thrombosis at the time of surgery (p = 0.04).
Conclusion: These results support a systematic screening for splanchnic vein thrombosis in patients
awaiting transplantation. They suggest that in these patients, anticoagulation is safe and has a significant
impact on recanalisation as well as prevention of extension of thrombosis.
S
planchnic vein thrombosis is not an uncommon
complication in patients with end stage cirrhosis.
Estimation of its incidence has been variable from series
to series, ranging from 2% to 26 %,1 2 possibly due to different
diagnostic criteria and different study populations. Several
risk factors have been identified, including severity of liver
insufficiency3 as well as inherited or acquired coagulation
disorders (that is, factor V Leiden, factor II, and MTHFR gene
mutations, antiphospholipid syndrome).4 Interestingly, two
or more prothrombotic disorders appear to be frequently
associated in patients with portal vein thrombosis.5
In candidates for liver transplantation, the patency of the
portal vein is crucial.1 6–9 When partial, portal vein thrombosis
is likely to make anastomoses technically difficult and to be a
significant source of morbidity and mortality. In particular, it
may favour early post transplantation portal vein thrombo￾sis.10 When complete and extensive, portal vein thrombosis
represents a definitive contraindication for transplantation
unless complex alternative techniques such as caval transpo￾sition are used.11 12 However, even when applicable, these
alternative techniques were shown to carry high rates of
morbidity and mortality.12 13 As waiting times exceed six
months in most liver transplant centres, early detection of
and treatment for de novo thrombosis in those who did not
have evidence of thrombosis at the time of listing is an
important issue. Similarly, the ways in which extension of
thrombosis could be prevented in those who have partial
thrombosis at the time of listing have not been precisely
investigated.
The efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy has been
documented in cases of recent splanchnic vein thrombosis
in those without underlying liver disease. It has been shown
that anticoagulant therapy prevents the extension of
thrombosis and, in some cases, allows complete recanalisa￾tion.14 Whether this approach is applicable, efficient, and safe
in cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation, especially
those with a marked decrease in coagulation factors due to
advanced liver insufficiency, has not been documented.
The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of
splanchnic vein thrombosis in candidates for transplantation
at the time of evaluation, the incidence of de novo
thrombosis while awaiting transplantation, and the useful￾ness and safety of anticoagulant therapy in patients with
either pre-existing or de novo thrombosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
A total of 251 consecutive cirrhotic patients listed for a first
liver transplantation from January 1996 to December 2001
were analysed. There were 196 males and 55 females. Mean
age was 49 (8.5) years (range 15–63). Indications for
transplantation were alcoholic cirrhosis in 59, hepatitis B
virus (HBV) related cirrhosis in 22, hepatitis C virus (HCV)
related cirrhosis in 42, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 84,
primary biliary cirrhosis in nine, primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis in 13, genetic haemochromatosis in three, a1-antitrypsin
deficiency in one, and cirrhosis of unknown origin in 18. All
patients with HCC had an underling cirrhosis and all had one
nodule less than 5 cm or two or three nodules each less than
3 cm according to the current recommendations for trans￾plantation.15 In this subgroup, the origin of the underlying
cirrhosis was alcohol in 16, HBV infection in 18, HCV

infection in 41, haemochromatosis in four, and miscellaneous
causes in five. Whatever the number and size of the nodules,
patients with evidence of portal invasion or extrahepatic
metastases were excluded. Patients with Budd-Chiari syn￾drome evaluated during the study period were excluded.
The characteristics of the study population at the time of
evaluation are shown in table 1.
At the time of evaluation for transplantation, all candidates
underwent detailed abdominal imaging investigations
including Doppler ultrasonography (Doppler-US) and helical
computed tomography (CT), techniques which have been
proved to be highly accurate for diagnosing splanchnic vein
thrombosis.16 17 Special attention focused on the patency of
the portal vein and its branches, the mesenteric vein, the
splenic vein, and the hepatic veins. When needed, these
investigations were completed by angiography (n = 22) and/
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 10). In addition,
three patients with HCC and portal vein thrombosis for
whom it was impossible to rule out malignant vascular
invasion on the basis of imaging techniques, had US guided
biopsy of the thrombus. In all three patients malignant
vascular invasion was ruled out by histological examination.
From the time of listing up to transplantation, all patients
underwent systematic screening at three month intervals
while awaiting a donor. This screening included clinical
assessment, biochemical tests, and Doppler-US. Patients with
HCC and/or those who had evidence of splanchnic vein
thrombosis at evaluation also had a CT scan every three
months. Similarly, patients who were found to have de novo
thrombosis with Doppler-US had a CT scan and/or MRI to
document precisely the extent of thrombosis.
From 1996 to 1998, patients with either partial or complete
thrombosis of the splanchnic veins did not receive anti￾coagulation until transplantation. However, these patients
had a careful screening, as described above. Either at the time
of evaluation or during follow up, evidence of extensive
thrombosis involving the portal and mesenteric veins was
considered a contraindication for transplantation, unless
there was subsequent recanalisation. In contrast, patients in
whom the proximal portion of the portal vein and mesenteric
vein were patent were still considered as eligible for
transplantation. Patients with partial thrombosis were also
considered eligible.
From 1999 to 2001, we adopted a policy of administration
of anticoagulant therapy to patients who had either
splanchnic vein thrombosis at the time of listing or de novo
thrombosis while awaiting a graft. This policy was adopted
on the basis of the positive results which had been reported
with anticoagulation in non-cirrhotic patients with portal or
mesenteric vein thrombosis.14 18 Anticoagulation consisted of
low molecular weight heparin (nadroparin, 5700 UI/day
subcutaneously) followed by vitamin K antagonists
(acenocoumarol). When vitamin K antagonists were started,
low molecular weight heparin was discontinued after a
minimum of five days and when the international normal￾ised ratio (INR) was at least 2.0. Doses of vitamin K
antagonists were adjusted in order to achieve an INR of
2.0–3.0. INR values were determined every 2–3 weeks for
dose adjustments. Each dose adjustment consisted of an
increase or decrease in the daily acenocoumarol dose of
1–2 mg. This modified protocol was approved by our local
ethics committee. Contraindications for transplantation with
respect to extent of thrombosis were similar during the two
study periods. Indications for transplantation were not
significantly different during the two time periods.
At the time of the transplantation procedure, splanchnic
vessels were assessed by direct examination and intraopera￾tive Doppler-US. If needed, coagulation disorders were
reversed by administration of fresh frozen plasma during
the initial phase of transplantation procedure.
Results for continuous variables are expressed as means
(SD). Student’s t test, x2 test, Fisher’s exact test, Mann￾Whitney test, analysis of variance, and logistic regression
analysis were used where appropriate. Survival analysis was
performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons
were made by log rank test. For all tests, p,0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Analysis was performed
using SPSS (Chicago, Illinois, USA) and SAS (Cary, North
Carolina, USA) software.
RESULTS
Splanchnic vein thrombosis at the time of listing and
incidence on the waiting list
Twenty one of 251 patients (8.4%) had splanchnic vein
thrombosis at the time of listing for transplantation.
Fourteen had partial portal vein thrombosis with an
extension to the superior mesenteric vein in four and to the
splenic vein in one. Thrombosis was limited to the right
portal branch in five cases and involved both right and left
branches in four.
Eight additional patients (3.2 %) developed de novo
thrombosis while awaiting a donor, 12.1 (7.7) (range 4–27)
months, on average, after listing. Six of these eight patients
had partial portal vein thrombosis with an extension to the
superior mesenteric vein in one. The two remaining patients
developed complete portal vein thrombosis with an extension
to the right and left intrahepatic branches. These two patients
were not delisted because the proximal part of the portal vein
as well as the mesenteric vein remained patent.
Overall, 28 died on the waiting list (11%), 4.8
(5.7) months, on average, after listing. Twelve (5%) were
delisted because of a contraindication other than thrombosis
and five (2%) were delisted because of a significant
improvement. The remaining 206 patients were transplanted
a mean of 5 (4.7) months after listing.
At the time of transplantation surgery, nine patients who
did not have evidence of splanchnic vein thrombosis either at
evaluation or during screening after listing were found to
have extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis. Thrombosis was
partial in eight patients and complete in one. All transplanted
patients had detailed examination of the resected liver and
none of those with HCC or thrombosis had evidence of
tumoral vascular invasion.
In this population, a total of 38 patients (15.1%) were
found to have splanchnic vein thrombosis at any time during
the study period. Seventeen of 230 patients (7.4%) who did
not have thrombosis at evaluation developed de novo
thrombosis documented either during follow up on the
waiting list or peroperatively. Neither at the time of initial
evaluation nor during follow up did we observe discordance
between Doppler-US and helical CT.

Risk factors for splanchnic vein thrombosis
Univariate analysis showed that the risk for splanchnic vein
thrombosis was significantly associated with platelet count, a
history of ascites, Child-Pugh score, a past history of variceal
bleeding, and the technique used for endoscopic treatment
(table 2). Platelet count was significantly lower in the 17
patients with de novo thrombosis or thrombosis at the time
of surgery than in the remaining 229 patients (73 (43) v 108
(67) 109
/l; p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that
platelet count and a past history of variceal bleeding were
the only independent predictive factors for thrombosis
(p = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). It is worth noting that
platelet count was inversely related to the probability of
thrombosis.
In patients who did not have splanchnic vein thrombosis
at the time of listing, the risk of de novo thrombosis
was significantly and independently associated with the
time interval between listing and transplantation (8.5
(6.8) months v 4.8 (4.4) months; p = 0.002), along with the
two factors cited above (that is, platelet count and a past
history of variceal bleeding).
The direction of portal blood flow was precisely assessed by
Doppler-US in 60 of 251 patients. Fifty five of these 60
patients (92%) (15 of whom had splanchnic vein thrombosis)

had hepatopetal portal flow. None of the 15 patients with
splanchnic vein thrombosis were found to have inverted
portal flow. In parallel, none of the five patients with inverted
portal flow on Doppler-US had portal vein thrombosis during
follow up.
Impact of anticoagulant therapy in patients with
splanchnic vein thrombosis
Among 29 patients who had either splanchnic vein throm￾bosis at evaluation or de novo thrombosis while on the
waiting list, 19 (65.5%) received anticoagulation according to
the protocol detailed above and 10 (34.5%) did not receive
anticoagulation. Baseline criteria were comparable in the two
groups except for past history of variceal bleeding which was
significantly more frequent in those receiving anticoagulation
(table 3). The location and extent of thrombosis was not
significantly different whether or not patients received
anticoagulation (table 3). In this group of patients with
thrombosis, the waiting time was 4.4 (4.8) months in those
who did not receive anticoagulation compared with 8.1
(6.5) months in those who received anticoagulation. This
difference was not statistically significant.
Among 19 patients who received anticoagulation, eight
(42.1%) were found to have complete recanalisation, defined
by the absence of intravascular material on imaging
techniques in addition to restored blood flow on Doppler￾US, between initiation of treatment and transplantation.
Seven of these eight patients had partial thrombosis and one
had complete thrombosis at the time of initiation of
anticoagulation. Thrombosis was unchanged in 10 patients
and extended despite anticoagulation in the remaining one.
In this group of patients who received anticoagulation, the
proportion of de novo thrombosis was not significantly
different in those who had recanalisation (3/8) compared
with those who had stabilisation or extension (3/11). Figure 1
(A, B) shows sequential MRI in a patient who had a partially
obstructive thrombus at the junction of the splenic and
mesenteric veins and had complete recanalisation with
anticoagulation.
Among the 10 patients who did not receive anticoagula￾tion, none had complete recanalisation. Thrombosis was
unchanged in four and extended in six. Overall, the
proportion of patients who had recanalisation was signifi￾cantly higher in those who received (8/19) than in those who
did not receive (0/10, p = 0.002) anticoagulation.
Among the 19 patients who received anticoagulation, only
one had an upper digestive tract bleeding episode after
prophylactic variceal band ligation. This bleeding episode was
due to a post ligation ulceration in the oesophagus and the
course was favourable with antisecretory agents and transfu￾sion of two units of packed red cells. No other side effect
occurred during waiting time and anticoagulation did not
have to be discontinued in any patient.
Impact of thrombosis and anticoagulation therapy on
surgery and post transplantation survival
Among 29 patients who had splanchnic vein thrombosis at
evaluation or de novo thrombosis while on the waiting list
and were transplanted, mean duration of the procedure was
not significantly different whether or not they received (11.2
(2) hours) or did not receive (10.6 (1.3) hours) anticoagula￾tion. Similarly, red blood cell transfusions were not sig￾nificantly different in the two groups (5.4 (3.7) v 5.2 (3) units
in patients with and without anticoagulation, respectively).
Therefore, there was no evidence that anticoagulation by
itself increased peroperative blood loss or duration of surgery.
However, considering the whole population, blood transfu￾sions were significantly more important in those who had
splanchnic vein thrombosis at the time of surgery (7.6
(4.8) units) compared with those who did not have
splanchnic vein thrombosis (2.8 (3.6) units, p = 0.0004).
Two year post transplantation survival was 83% in the
group with a patent portal vein at the time of transplantation,
82% in the group with partial portal vein thrombosis, and
50% in the group with complete portal vein thrombosis
(fig 2). Post transplantation survival was not significantly
different in those without portal vein thrombosis compared
with those with partial thrombosis. In contrast, survival was
significantly higher in patients with either patent portal vein
or partial thrombosis compared with those with complete
thrombosis (83% v 50% two year survival, respectively;
p = 0.04) (fig 3). In parallel, in the subgroup of patients
who had portal vein thrombosis at the time of transplanta￾tion, complete thrombosis was significantly more frequent in

partially obstructive thrombus at the junction of the splenic and
mesenteric veins (A, white arrow) and complete resolution of the

those who did not receive anticoagulation (4/5) compared
with those who did (0/12, p,0.0001). In patients without
portal vein thrombosis or partial thrombosis, survival was not
significantly different whether or not they received anti￾coagulation (79% v 83% two year survival rate, respectively).
In patients who did not have splanchnic vein thrombosis
either at evaluation or during follow up, two year survival
rate was similar during the two time periods of the study
(1996–1998 v 1999–2001, 84% v 84%).
The disposition of patients according to the presence of
thrombosis and response to anticoagulation is shown in figs 4
and 5.
DISCUSSION
In the present series, 8.4% of patients were found to have
splanchnic vein thrombosis at evaluation. This proportion
probably underestimates the true incidence of splanchnic
vein thrombosis during end stage cirrhosis. Indeed, a
significant proportion of patients with extensive thrombosis
may not have been referred to our centre because they were
not considered as suitable candidates for transplantation and
therefore were not taken into account for analysis. None the
less, eight of 230 (3.2%) patients who did not have
thrombosis at evaluation developed thrombosis while on
the waiting list. Importantly, the majority of these patients
(6/8) only had partial portal vein thrombosis. Although
pretransplantation Doppler-US screening was performed at
three month intervals, nine additional patients were found to
have thrombosis at the time of surgery. Again, eight of these
nine patients had only partial thrombosis and transplanta￾tion was technically feasible in all cases.
Multivariate analysis showed that the only independent
predictive factors for thrombosis were platelet count and a
past history of variceal bleeding. Surprisingly, the risk of
thrombosis was inversely correlated to platelet count. It was
significantly higher in those patients who had the lowest
platelet count. This paradoxical finding illustrates the fact
that, with respect to splanchnic vein thrombosis, the impact
of portal hypertension, as reflected by hypersplenism, out￾weighs the proper effects of low platelet count in preventing
thrombosis. It also illustrates the fact that cirrhotic patients
with a marked decrease in platelet count as well as decreased
coagulation factors are not protected against portal vein
thrombosis. In this series, we failed to show a significant
relation between reversed portal blood flow on Doppler-US
and de novo thrombosis. Although the direction of portal
flow was only assessed in a subgroup of 60 patients, in this
subgroup, hepatofugal portal flow was present in less than
10%. This proportion is in line with that observed in other
series.19–21 A more precise evaluation of the direction of portal
flow and blood velocity with Doppler-US could help predict
more accurately the risk of thrombosis. We found an
independent correlation between a past history of variceal
bleeding and thrombosis. It could be argued that the
increased incidence in variceal bleeding might be a con￾sequence of thrombosis, leading to an increase in portal
hypertension. However, we also found that among those who
did not have thrombosis at evaluation, a history of variceal
bleeding prior to evaluation was also an independent risk
factor for de novo thrombosis. These findings suggest that
episodes of variceal bleeding, reflecting the severity of portal
hypertension, are more likely to be predisposing factors for,
rather than a consequence of, thrombosis itself. Therefore,
variceal bleeding seems unlikely to be secondary to throm￾bosis. The proportion of patients who had endoscopic

treatment of varices, either sclerosis or elastic band ligation,
was not significantly different between those who had
thrombosis and those who did not. However, it remains
impossible to exclude definitively that in some cases
endoscopic treatment favoured the occurrence of thrombosis.
In this series, the global incidence of de novo thrombosis
(7.4%, including thrombosis diagnosed at the time of
surgery) could be considered relatively low. However, this
low incidence must be interpreted in the light of the relatively
short duration on the waiting list (mean 3.8 (3) months for
those who were transplanted) in the present series. As the
interval between listing and transplantation was an inde￾pendent predictive factor for thrombosis, the incidence of de
novo thrombosis could be much higher in populations for
which waiting times exceed six months, which gives further
support for a systematic screening policy.
The most important finding in this study was that the
proportion of partial or complete recanalisations was
significantly higher in those who had received anticoagula￾tion than in those who did not. The two groups were not
randomised but they corresponded to two different time
periods with two different policies concerning anticoagula￾tion. The characteristics of the patients were comparable in
the two groups except for past variceal bleeding. However,
past variceal bleeding was more frequent in those who
received anticoagulation. Finally, none of the patients who
did not receive anticoagulation had partial or complete
recanalisation. Therefore, together with the positive results
which have been reported in non-cirrhotic patients with
portal vein thrombosis,14 18 these results strongly suggest that
anticoagulation had a significant advantage over absence of
specific therapy. A randomised study would avoid the
potential limitations related to the use of an historical
control group. It can be estimated that, given the data from
the present series, a study population of 120 patients (two
groups of 60 patients each) would be necessary to demon￾strate a significant difference in the rate of recanalisation
with or without anticoagulation.
Systematic screening based on repeated Doppler-US in
those without thrombosis at evaluation made it possible to
detect de novo thrombosis, to start anticoagulation, and to
prevent an extension of thrombosis or, in some cases, allow
complete recanalisation. Therefore, early detection of de novo
thrombosis followed by anticoagulation reduced the risk of
complete portal vein thrombosis, a recognised technical
difficulty at the time of transplantation.
Until now, most groups have been reluctant to use
anticoagulation in candidates for transplantation with portal
hypertension because, among other inconveniences, it could
potentially precipitate variceal bleeding episodes. In addition,
it has been suspected that anticoagulation could favour
bleeding at the time of surgery. Finally, the usefulness of
anticoagulation itself in patients with decreased coagulation
factors and low platelet count was regarded as questionable.
However, our results as well as those from other studies
suggest that anticoagulation may gain wider acceptance.
Firstly, there is no clear evidence that, within the therapeutic
range, anticoagulation has a significant impact on the risk of
variceal bleeding.18 Indeed, variceal bleeding is essentially
influenced by portal hypertension and in our study popula￾tion only one of 19 patients receiving anticoagulation had an
episode of bleeding. Secondly, we did not find evidence that
anticoagulation itself increased the duration of transplanta￾tion procedure or blood loss. In contrast, those who had
portal vein thrombosis, whether or not they received
anticoagulation, had significantly more transfusions of red
blood cell units. Again, these findings indicate that, as well
as variceal bleeding, the effects of anticoagulation on
splanchnic vein patency may overcome its potential impact
on haemostasis and surgical bleeding. The optimal anti￾coagulation regimen in the pre-transplantation setting has to
be determined. However, one of the advantages of vitamin K
antagonists over heparin derivates was that their effects
could be rapidly corrected by transfusion of fresh frozen
plasma at the beginning of the transplant procedure.
This study confirms the results of others showing that
complete portal vein thrombosis is associated with a
significant decrease in post transplantation survival.6 22 In
contrast, we found that partial portal vein thrombosis did not
have a significant impact on survival. The reasons for this
difference in terms of mortality are probably multifactorial,
including among other factors, technical difficulties during
hepatectomy (due to the presence of a cavernoma and
marked portal hypertension) and vascular reconstruction,
abundant transfusions, early recurrence of portal vein
thrombosis, and graft dysfunction. None the less, it is worth
noting that this survival difference was essentially marked by
an excess of early post transplantation mortality, as shown by
an early drop in the survival curve (fig 3). Provided the
proximal portion of the portal vein and/or superior mesen￾teric vein remain patent, complete portal vein thrombosis
might not be considered as a definitive contraindication for
liver transplantation. In patients who are known to have
complete portal vein thrombosis, harvesting of the maximum
length of splanchnic veins in the donor and, if necessary, the
use of veno-venous bypass during the procedure may
improve technical feasibility.
In conclusion, the results of this study support systematic
screening for de novo thrombosis in patients awaiting
transplantation. Complete portal vein thrombosis, although
it may not represent a definitive contraindication for
transplantation in all cases, is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Even if the incidence of de novo
thrombosis is relatively low, Doppler-US allows the detection
of thrombosis at an early stage and anticoagulation to start, a
treatment which, on the basis of our findings, might help
prevent extension or achieve recanalisation. As portal vein
patency had a significant impact on survival, our results also
suggest that the benefits of anticoagulation outweigh its
potential inconveniences in terms of bleeding and peropera￾tive transfusions. A three month interval between Doppler￾US examinations does not exclude the fact that de novo
thrombosis may be discovered at the time of surgery.
Monthly screening, although incurring additional costs,
might reduce this risk. Overall, a more precise assessment
of portal blood flow as well as prothrombotic states may help
better define high risk populations for splanchnic vein
thrombosis among candidates for transplantation.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................

Answer
From question on page 629
Endoscopic ultrasound showed a hypoechoic and homogen￾eous tumour arising from the mucosa (the second layer) and
growing into the submucosa (third layer). Histology showed
a carcinoid tumour with free margins (fig 3). Because the
gastric lesion was solitary and gastric biopsies did not show
atrophic gastritis, the diagnosis of sporadic gastric carcinoid
was adopted.
Gastric carcinoid tumours are a rare disease. They account
for 2% of all gastrointestinal carcinoids.1 A classification
system distinguishing three types of gastric carcinoid
tumours has been proposed. Patients are often asymptomatic,
with carcinoids found incidentally at endoscopy. When
symptoms do occur, they are usually dyspeptic in nature.
Only five previous cases of severe bleeding from gastric
carcinoid, requiring surgical treatment, have been reported.2
In all cases, a single gastric carcinoid of the sporadic type was
found. Sporadic carcinoids have higher rates of regional
lymph node involvement. Surgical resection with lymph node
sampling is generally recommended, as was done in our
case.3 Endoscopic ultrasound is the method of choice in
identifying submucosal tumours. Although we would suggest
that if a gastric submucosal tumour .1 cm is found at
endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound will distinguish different
lesions arising from the gastrointestinal layers and will guide
management because certain types are associated with a high
malignant potential.4 Hence a gastric carcinoid tumour
should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
submucosal tumours.
