Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System 
Inhibitors in Patients with Covid-19
Muthiah Vaduganathan, M.D., M.P.H., Orly Vardeny, Pharm.D., Thomas Michel, M.D., Ph.D., 
John J.V. McMurray, M.D., Marc A. Pfeffer, M.D., Ph.D., and Scott D. Solomon, M.D.
The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) 
is an elegant cascade of vasoactive peptides that 
orchestrate key processes in human physiology. 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 
(SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2, which have been 
responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002 to 2004 
and for the more recent coronavirus disease 2019 
(Covid-19) pandemic, respectively, interface with 
the RAAS through angiotensin-converting enzyme 
2 (ACE2), an enzyme that physiologically counters 
RAAS activation but also functions as a receptor 
for both SARS viruses.1,2 The interaction between 
the SARS viruses and ACE2 has been proposed as 
a potential factor in their infectivity,3,4 and there 
are concerns about the use of RAAS inhibitors 
that may alter ACE2 and whether variation in ACE2 
expression may be in part responsible for disease 
virulence in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.5-8
Indeed, some media sources and health systems 
have recently called for the discontinuation of 
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers 
(ARBs), both prophylactically and in the context 
of suspected Covid-19.
Given the common use of ACE inhibitors and 
ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these 
drugs in patients with Covid-19 is urgently need￾ed. Here, we highlight that the data in humans 
are too limited to support or refute these hypoth￾eses and concerns. Specifically, we discuss the 
uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels 
and activity in humans, and we propose an alter￾native hypothesis that ACE2 may be beneficial 
rather than harmful in patients with lung injury. 
We also explicitly raise the concern that with￾drawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful in 
certain high-risk patients with known or sus￾pected Covid-19.
Covid -19 and Older Adults 
with Coexisting Conditions
Initial reports5-8 have called attention to the po￾tential overrepresentation of hypertension among 
patients with Covid-19. In the largest of several 
case series from China that have been released 
during the Covid-19 pandemic (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org), hypertension was 
the most frequent coexisting condition in 1099 
patients, with an estimated prevalence of 15%9
; 
however, this estimate appears to be lower than 
the estimated prevalence of hypertension seen with 
other viral infections10 and in the general popu￾lation in China.11,12
Coexisting conditions, including hypertension, 
have consistently been reported to be more com￾mon among patients with Covid-19 who have had 
severe illness, been admitted to the intensive care 
unit, received mechanical ventilation, or died than 
among patients who have had mild illness. There 
are concerns that medical management of these 
coexisting conditions, including the use of RAAS 
inhibitors, may have contributed to the adverse 
health outcomes observed. However, these con￾ditions appear to track closely with advancing 
age,13 which is emerging as the strongest predic￾tor of Covid-19–related death.14 Unfortunately, 
reports to date have not rigorously accounted for 
age or other key factors that contribute to health 
as potential confounders in risk prediction. With 
other infective illnesses, coexisting conditions 
such as hypertension have been key prognostic 
determinants,10 and this also appears to be the 
case with Covid-19.15
It is important to note that, despite inferences

about the use of background RAAS inhibitors, 
specific details have been lacking in studies (Ta￾ble S1). Population-based studies have estimated 
that only 30 to 40% of patients in China who have 
hypertension are treated with any antihypertensive 
therapy; RAAS inhibitors are used alone or in 
combination in 25 to 30% of these treated pa￾tients.11,12 Given such estimates, only a fraction 
of patients with Covid-19, at least in China, are 
anticipated to have been previously treated with 
RAAS inhibitors. Data showing patterns of use 
of RAAS inhibitors and associated health out￾comes that rigorously account for treatment indi￾cation and illness severity among patients with 
Covid-19 are needed.
Uncertain Effec ts of R A AS 
Inhibitors on ACE2 in Humans
Tissue-specific and circulating components of 
the RAAS make up a complex intersecting net￾work of regulatory and counterregulatory pep￾tides (Fig. 1). ACE2 is a key counterregulatory 
enzyme that degrades angiotensin II to angio￾tensin-(1–7), thereby attenuating its effects on 
vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis. 
Although angiotensin II is the primary substrate 
of ACE2, that enzyme also cleaves angiotensin I 
to angiotensin-(1–9) and participates in the hy￾drolysis of other peptides.16 In studies in humans, 
tissue samples from 15 organs have shown that 
ACE2 is expressed broadly, including in the heart 
and kidneys, as well as on the principal target 
cells for SARS-CoV-2 (and the site of dominant 
injury), the lung alveolar epithelial cells.17 Of in￾terest, the circulating levels of soluble ACE2 are 
low and the functional role of ACE2 in the lungs 
appears to be relatively minimal under normal 
conditions18 but may be up-regulated in certain 
clinical states.
Because ACE inhibitors and ARBs have different 
effects on angiotensin II, the primary substrate 
of ACE2, the effects of these agents on ACE2 levels 
and activity may be anticipated to differ. Despite 
substantial structural homology between ACE and 
ACE2, their enzyme active sites are distinct. As a 
result, ACE inhibitors in clinical use do not di￾rectly affect ACE2 activity.19 Experimental animal 
models have shown mixed findings with respect 
to the effects of ACE inhibitors on ACE2 levels 
or activity in tissue.20-25 Similarly, animal models 
have had inconsistent findings with respect to 
the effects of ARBs on ACE2, with some showing 
that ARBs may increase messenger RNA expres￾sion or protein levels of ACE2 in tissue21,26-34 and 
others showing no effect.23
In contrast to available animal models, there 
are few studies in humans regarding the effects 
of RAAS inhibition on ACE2 expression. In one 
study, the intravenous administration of ACE in￾hibitors in patients with coronary artery disease 
did not influence angiotensin-(1–7) production, 
a finding that calls into question whether ACE in￾hibitors have any direct effects on ACE2-directed 
angiotensin II metabolism.35 Similarly, in another 
study, among patients with hypertension, angio￾tensin-(1–7) levels appeared to be unaffected after 
initial treatment with the ACE inhibitor capto￾pril; however, with exposure to captopril mono￾therapy over a period of 6 months, angioten￾sin-(1–7) levels increased.36 Furthermore, few 
studies have examined plasma ACE2 activity or 
urinary ACE2 levels in patients who have received 
long-term treatment with RAAS inhibitors. In 
cross-sectional studies involving patients with 
heart failure,37 atrial fibrillation,38 aortic steno￾sis,39 and coronary artery disease,40 plasma ACE2 
activity was not higher among patients who were 
taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs than among un￾treated patients. In a longitudinal cohort study 
involving Japanese patients with hypertension, 
urinary ACE2 levels were higher among patients 
who received long-term treatment with the ARB 
olmesartan than among untreated control pa￾tients, but that association was not observed with 
the ACE inhibitor enalapril or with other ARBs 
(losartan, candesartan, valsartan, and telmisar￾tan).41 Previous treatment with ACE inhibitors 
was associated with increased intestinal messen￾ger RNA levels of ACE2 in one study, but that 
association was not observed with ARBs25; data 
are lacking regarding the effects of RAAS inhibi￾tors on lung-specific expression of ACE2.
These seemingly conflicting data indicate the 
complexity underlying RAAS responses to path￾way modulators and reinforce the concept that 
findings from preclinical models may not readily 
translate to human physiology. Such data do sug￾gest that effects on ACE2 should not be assumed 
to be uniform across RAAS inhibitors or even in

response to therapies within a given drug class.41
It is important to note that the plasma ACE2 level 
may not be a reliable indicator of the activity of 
the full-length membrane-bound form, in part 
because ACE2 is shed from the membrane, a 
process that appears to be separately regulated 
by an endogenous inhibitor.42 In addition to the 
degree of expression, the biologic relevance of 
ACE2 may vary according to tissue and clinical 
state. Unfortunately, data showing the effects of 
ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and other RAAS inhibi￾tors on lung-specific expression of ACE2 in ex￾perimental animal models and in humans are 
lacking. Furthermore, even if RAAS inhibitors 
modify ACE2 levels or activity (or both) in target 
tissue beds, clinical data are lacking to indicate 
whether this would in turn facilitate greater en￾gagement and entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike pro￾tein. Further mechanistic studies in humans are 
needed to better define the unique interplay be￾tween SARS-CoV-2 and the RAAS network.
 Potential for Benefit R ather Than 
Harm of RAAS Blockers in Covid-19
SARS-CoV-2 appears not only to gain initial entry 
through ACE2 but also to subsequently down￾regulate ACE2 expression such that the enzyme 
is unable to exert protective effects in organs. It 
has been postulated but unproven that unabated 
angiotensin II activity may be in part responsible 
for organ injury in Covid-19.43,44 After the initial 
engagement of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, there 
is subsequent down-regulation of ACE2 abundance 
Figure 1. Interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System.
Shown is the initial entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells, primarily type 
II pneumocytes, after binding to its functional receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). After endocytosis 
of the viral complex, surface ACE2 is further down-regulated, resulting in unopposed angiotensin II accumulation. 
Local activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system may mediate lung injury responses to viral insults.

on cell surfaces.45 Continued viral infection and 
replication contribute to reduced membrane ACE2 
expression, at least in vitro in cultured cells.46
Down-regulation of ACE2 activity in the lungs 
facilitates the initial neutrophil infiltration in 
response to bacterial endotoxin47 and may result 
in unopposed angiotensin II accumulation and 
local RAAS activation. Indeed, in experimental 
mouse models, exposure to SARS-CoV-1 spike pro￾tein induced acute lung injury, which is limited by 
RAAS blockade.45 Other mouse models have sug￾gested that dysregulation of ACE2 may mediate 
acute lung injury that is secondary to virulent 
strains of influenza48,49 and respiratory syncytial 
virus.50 In a small study, patients with Covid-19 
appeared to have elevated levels of plasma angio￾tensin II, which were in turn correlated with 
total viral load and degree of lung injury.44 Res￾toration of ACE2 through the administration of 
recombinant ACE2 appeared to reverse this dev￾astating lung-injury process in preclinical models 
of other viral infections49,50 and safely reduced 
angiotensin II levels in a phase 2 trial evaluating 
acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans.51
Dysregulated ACE2 may theoretically also at￾tenuate cardioprotection in the context of myo￾cardial involvement and abnormal pulmonary 
hemodynamics52,53 in Covid-19. Markers of myo￾cardial injury have been shown to be elevated 
during the disease course of Covid-1954 and to 
increase rapidly with clinical deterioration and 
preceding death.14 Many viruses are cardiotropic, 
and subclinical viral myocarditis is commonly 
seen in viremia associated with a wide range of 
infectious agents. ACE2 has a well-recognized 
role in myocardial recovery and injury response; 
in one study, ACE2 knockout in animal models 
contributed to adverse left ventricular remodeling 
in response to acute injury driven by angioten￾sin II.55 In autopsies of patients who died from 
SARS, 35% of heart samples showed the pres￾ence of viral RNA, which in turn was associated 
with reduced ACE2 protein expression.56 Admin￾istration of recombinant ACE2 normalizes angio￾tensin II levels in human explanted hearts with 
dilated cardiomyopathy.57 These hypotheses have 
prompted trials to test whether the provision of 
recombinant ACE2 protein may be beneficial in 
restoring balance to the RAAS network and po￾tentially preventing organ injury (ClinicalTrials
.gov number, NCT04287686). In addition, paired 
trials of losartan as a treatment for Covid-19 are 
being conducted among patients who have not 
previously received treatment with a RAAS inhibi￾tor and are either hospitalized (NCT04312009) or 
not hospitalized (NCT04311177).
Maintenance of R A AS Inhibitors 
with Known or Suspected Covid-19
Despite these theoretical uncertainties regarding 
whether pharmacologic regulation of ACE2 may 
influence the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, there is 
clear potential for harm related to the withdrawal 
of RAAS inhibitors in patients in otherwise stable 
condition. Covid-19 is particularly severe in pa￾tients with underlying cardiovascular diseases,9
and in many of these patients, active myocar￾dial injury,14,54,58-60 myocardial stress,59 and cardio￾myopathy59 develop during the course of illness. 
RAAS inhibitors have established benefits in pro￾tecting the kidney and myocardium, and their 
withdrawal may risk clinical decompensation in 
high-risk patients.
Although rates of heart failure have been in￾frequently reported in epidemiologic reports from 
China to date, the prevalence of heart failure 
among critically ill patients with Covid-19 in the 
United States may be high (>40%).59 In the 
Quinapril Heart Failure Trial, among patients with 
chronic symptomatic heart failure, withdrawal 
of quinapril resulted in a progressive decline in 
clinical status.61 In the TRED-HF trial, among 
asymptomatic patients with heart failure with 
recovered left ventricular ejection fraction, the 
phased withdrawal of medical therapy (including 
RAAS inhibitors) resulted in rapid relapse of di￾lated cardiomyopathy.62 In addition, RAAS inhibi￾tors are a cornerstone of therapy after myocar￾dial infarction: maintenance of therapy in the days 
to weeks after the index event has been shown to 
reduce early mortality.63 Among patients with 
unstable clinical status, myocardial injury asso￾ciated with Covid-19 may pose even higher early 
risks after withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors.
Withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors that are being 
administered for the management of hyperten￾sion may be less risky than withdrawal of RAAS 
inhibitors that are being administered for condi￾tions in which they are considered guideline￾The New England Journal of Medicine

directed therapy but may be associated with other 
challenges. Switching from a RAAS inhibitor to 
another antihypertensive therapy in a stable am￾bulatory patient may require careful follow-up to 
avoid rebound increases in blood pressure. In 
addition, selection of dose-equivalent antihyper￾tensive therapies may be challenging in practice 
and may be patient-dependent. Even small and 
short-lived periods of blood pressure instability 
after a therapeutic change have been associated 
with excess cardiovascular risk.64-66 This may be 
an especially important consideration in patients 
with Covid-19, which appears to result in a state 
of RAAS activation,44 and in settings (e.g., China) 
where baseline blood-pressure control is infre￾quently reached at the population level.11,12
The effects of withdrawing RAAS inhibitors 
or switching treatments are uncertain among pa￾tients with chronic kidney disease. Although re￾ported rates of chronic kidney disease appear to 
be low among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 
in China (1 to 3%) (Table S1), the prevalence may 
be higher among patients who are critically ill 
and among those in other geographic regions.59
Many patients have varying degrees of acute kid￾ney injury during illness.14,67,68 For these high-risk 
patients, individualized treatment decisions re￾garding the maintenance of RAAS inhibitors that 
are guided by hemodynamic status, renal function, 
and clinical stability are recommended.
On the basis of the available evidence, we 
think that, despite the theoretical concerns and 
uncertainty regarding the effect of RAAS inhibi￾tors on ACE2 and the way in which these drugs 
might affect the propensity for or severity of 
Covid-19, RAAS inhibitors should be continued 
in patients in otherwise stable condition who are 
at risk for, are being evaluated for, or have Covid-19 
(see text box), a position now supported by mul￾tiple specialty societies (Table S2). Although ad￾ditional data may further inform the treatment 
of high-risk patients with Covid-19, clinicians need 
to be cognizant of the unintended consequences of 
prematurely discontinuing proven therapies in 
response to hypothetical concerns that may be 
based on incomplete experimental evidence.69

Key Points Related to the Interplay between Covid-19 
and the Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System
• ACE2, an enzyme that physiologically counters 
RAAS activation, is the functional receptor to SARS￾CoV-2, the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pan￾demic
• Select preclinical studies have suggested that RAAS 
inhibitors may increase ACE2 expression, raising 
concerns regarding their safety in patients with 
Covid-19
• Insufficient data are available to determine whether 
these observations readily translate to humans, and 
no studies have evaluated the effects of RAAS inhibi￾tors in Covid-19
• Clinical trials are under way to test the safety and 
efficacy of RAAS modulators, including recombinant 
human ACE2 and the ARB losartan in Covid-19
• Abrupt withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors in high-risk 
patients, including those who have heart failure or 
have had myocardial infarction, may result in clinical 
instability and adverse health outcomes
• Until further data are available, we think that RAAS 
inhibitors should be continued in patients in other￾wise stable condition who are at risk for, 
being evaluated for, or with Covid-19
