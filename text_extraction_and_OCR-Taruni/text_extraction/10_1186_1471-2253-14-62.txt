Abstract
Background: Fluid management in the perioperative period has been extensively studied but, despite that, “the
right amount” still remains uncertain. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state of the art of
intraoperative fluid approach today.
Discussion: In the current medical literature there are only heterogeneous viewpoints that gives the idea of how
confusing the situation is. The approach to the intraoperative fluid management is complex and it should be based
on human physiology and the current evidence.
Summary: An intraoperative restrictive fluid approach in major surgery may be beneficial while Goal-directed Therapy
should be superior to the liberal fluid strategy. Finally, we propose a rational approach currently used at our institution.

Background
Fluid management in the perioperative period has been
extensively studied but, despite that, “the right amount”
still remains uncertain. The only scientific evidence that
has recently arisen is that a fluid overload (without proper
guidance) seems to be a wrong strategy. Once again “devil
stay in the details” and a careful differentiation between
“fluid maintenance” and “fluid bolus” seems to be neces￾sary to understand. Fluid maintenance should represent
direct measurements of baseline evaporation rate from
skin, airways and eventually the surgical field. In the last
50 years many studies indicated that fluid loss because of
the perspiration in major abdominal surgery was high:
(bodyweight + 40) (kg) × 1(ml/kg/h) [1]. Over the years
this excessive fluids overutilization has been disguised and
rationalized by the effect of anesthetic drugs induced
hypotension, given also the reluctance of some clinicians
to the use of vasopressor agents. Lamke et al. experimen￾tally evaluated insensible perspiration and showed that it
was highly overestimated [2]. The authors calculated that
baseline evaporation was approximately 0.5 ml/Kg/h in
the awake adult and that it could increase to 1 mL/Kg/h
at the most, during large abdominal surgery (including all
bowel surgery). They also assessed that the impact of pre￾operative fasting on the state of the preoperative volemia
was negligible [2]. Over the last few years, this circum￾stances gave rise to two “styles” of anesthesia manage￾ment: the “liberal” and “restricted” fluid administration
strategy depending on the knowledge and beliefs of that
single anesthetist. But, what does “liberal approach” means
compared to a “restricted one”? A standardized quantita￾tive definition of these still remain uncertain; in the current
medical literature there are only heterogeneous examples
(Table 1), which give the idea of how confusing the situ￾ation is [3-6]. The purpose of this paper is to summarize
the state of the art of intraoperative fluid therapy and fluid
approach today.
Discussion
Pathophysiological aspect
The consequences of inappropriately high fluid adminis￾tration may be significant, relating to liberation of atrial
natriuretic peptide and an iatrogenic glycocalyx/vascular
endothelial junction dysfunction, which leads to fluid
shifts into the extravascular space [7]. This pathologic shift
is caused by a dysfunction of the vascular barrier basically

because of 3 reasons: surgical manipulation, reperfusion
injury and iatrogenic hypervolemia (regardless of kind of
fluids administered, crystalloids or colloids). Chappell
et al. described this type of fluid shifting toward the inter￾stitial space as follow [8]:
– Type 1 disorder: represents an almost colloid-free
shift of fluids and electrolytes out of the vasculature,
even if the vascular barrier is intact (i.e. if large
amounts of isotonic crystalloids are infused);
– Type 2 disorder: the fluids shift contains proteins
close to the plasma concentration, crossing a
functionally altered vascular barrier; this occurs
inconstantly and is related to the type, extent, and
duration of surgery and also the type of fluid used
(crystalloids versus colloids).
Type of fluids and patients population
Normal saline solution (the most used crystalloid) has
been used for over 50 years as an intraoperative, resusci￾tation and maintenance fluid; however its excessive use
can lead to hyperchloremic acidosis and type I disorder.
There is currently a debate regarding the morbidity asso￾ciated with this condition, although its incidence is
considered to be very low [9-11]. The British Consensus
Guidelines on Intravenous Fluid Therapy for Adult
Surgical Patients recommend the use of balanced crystal￾loids rather then just saline solution to avoid hyperclore￾mic acidosis [12].
The dispute in literature about fluids, as reported in
the 6S, CRYSTMAS and CHEST studies, clearly high￾lights the problem of the use of the right fluid in the
right setting (intensive care) and for the right patient
(septic patient and hemodynamic unstable intensive care
unit (ICU) patients) [13-15]. These three large random￾ized clinical trials evaluated outcome and adverse effects
of fluid resuscitation in septic patients comparing hydro￾xyethyl starches (HES) versus normal saline or Ringer
acetate’s solution: the result is that no difference in mor￾tality has been observed between the different types of
fluids (except in 6S study) [13]. In terms of kidney in￾jury, CHEST and 6S trials revealed that in HES group
there is a greater risk of developing renal dysfunction; 6S
trial is the only one study that evaluate HES 130/0.42
(tetraspan); but the CRYSTMAS trial did not reveal any
difference in terms of adverse events in both fluid groups
[15]. The CRISTAL study has found instead that the use
of colloids, compared to crystalloids, has resulted in a re￾duction of mortality at 90 days (not at 28 days) [16].
Finally, the protocols of these studies need to be dis￾cussed [17].
But the question is: are there any differences between
a “relatively” healthy patient, like who is undergoing
elective surgery, and a critically ill patient? In the first
case the intact tight glycocalyx/vascular endothelial junc￾tion provide a proper retention of colloids, while in the
second scenario the endotoxic shock or the generalized
inflammatory response can lead to the disruption of the
vascular barrier integrity, causing altered distribution of
large molecules [18-20]. Many anesthetists use colloids
solutions, mostly (HES), for blood volume expansion
[21]; among these the so-called tetrastarch (a third gen￾eration hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4) seems to have a
better safety profile [22,23] and there is no added risk to
develop acute kidney injury in patients who receive HES
during operation time [24]. In a recent review, Van Der
Linden et al. [25] analyzed the safety of modern starches
used during surgery: the authors concluded by arguing
that the use of starches during surgery do not induce
adverse renal effects, do not increase blood loss, do not
require more allogenic erythrocyte transfusions and do
not increase mortality [25]. But once again colloids need
to be administered at the right time for the right pa￾tient; its prophylactic use to anticipate acute bleeding
or to extend intravascular blood volume in a primary
normovolemic patient should no longer be considered
state-of-the-art. Colloids should be used to replace
blood loss.
Type and duration of surgery
The type 2 disorder, as described by Chappell, opens the
discussion about the type and duration of surgery (Figure 1)
[8]. Now a differentiation between major and minor opera￾tions as well as abdominal versus non-abdominal surgery
seems to be necessary. In a high risk surgical patient [19]
undergoing an intermediate to major risk surgery some
evidence based medicine support the application of a goal
directed therapy (GDT), in which fluid administration is
targeted on hemodynamic parameters (i.e. stroke volume)
with the aim to maximize the oxygen delivery and then
avoiding oxygen debt (Figures 1 and 2) [26,27]. This
approach should be the best thing to do, but there are
limitations that remain a major obstacle: the invasiveness
of pulmonary artery catheter and transplumonary dilution
technique and the poor accuracy and precision of the non￾invasive devices (Vigileo - Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine,
CA, USA; LiDCO - LiDCO Ltd, Cambridge, UK; ecc.)
[28,29]. On the other hand, in moderate to high risk

patient who is scheduled to undergo major surgery ex￾pected to last > 180 minute, a GTD approach with the
optimization of hemodynamic parameters could reduce
complications [8,30].
Historically, thoracic surgery has been the first married
with the restricted fluid approach, but recently the emer￾gence of new data shows that the risk of renal insuffi￾ciency after lung resection surgery is about 6-24%. So, in
this setting, is necessary to specify two major branch: in
patients undergoing pneumonectomy the restrictive ap￾proach seems to be up-to-date but for lesser resection a
GTD approach should be considered [31].
In clinical practice many studies investigated if a restrict￾ive approach can improve surgical outcome, especially in
major abdominal surgery. Lobo et al. demonstrated an im￾proved gastrointestinal function after elective colonic
resection; they also demonstrated a reduced length of
hospital stay (LOS) from 9 to 6 days in the restrictive
group [32]. Brandstrup demonstrated that in colo-rectal
surgery a restricted management reduced post-operative
complications and death [33]. Some studies in vascular pa￾tients undergoing major abdominal aortic surgery failed to
identify specific superior fluid regimens. However, in this
type of surgery, there is a convincing and independent
association between fluid accumulation and duration of
ventilation, duration of ICU stay, ICU and in-Hospital
mortality and development of complications as well, such
as acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney

injury [34]. In that context, individualized fluid adminis￾tration guided by flow parameters (GDT) seems to be the
best (GDT works best if it is obtained by flow algorithms)
[35,36]. However we must keep in mind that the
hemodynamic management with the GDT tends to lead
to “maximization” and not “optimization”, which are two
different concepts; and that routine cardiovascular moni￾toring such as blood pressure, heart rate and urine output
are not reliable predictors of intravascular fluid status and
thus not a rational guide to perioperative fluid therapy.
Finally, several studies seem to suggest that in low-risk
patients undergoing minor to intermediate risk surgery,
liberal strategy (non restrictive) may be preferable. It
reduces some postoperative complications such as nau￾sea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness and length of stay
[2,37-39]. In patients undergoing minor surgery, mostly in
the ambulatory setting, liberal fluid administration may
improve early recovery and symptoms of dehydratation
(dizziness, nausea and thirst) [40,41].
The third fluid administration strategy in the
perioperative setting: goal-directed therapy
The GDT is an approach focused on the use of cardiac
output (CO) and related parameters as end-points for
fluids and drugs to optimize tissue perfusion and oxy￾genation by maximizing oxygen delivery (DO2). This
technique was originally applied in surgical patients to
achieve normal or supranormal values of CO and DO2
to prevent the oxygen debt caused by the perioperative
increase in oxygen consumption [42]. Several clinical tri￾als, metanalysis and reviews demonstrated its effective￾ness, thus leading numerous societies to publish official
guidelines that recommend its use in high-risk surgical
patients [43-46].
Many tools can be used for GDT approach but the
esophageal doppler (ED) monitoring (CardioQ-ODM, Del￾tex Medical, Chichester, West Sussex, UK) is the most sup￾ported by the literature. There are eight randomized
controlled trials investigating ED-guided fluid administra￾tion: two in cardiac [47,48], two in orthopedic [49,50] and
four in abdominal surgery [51-54]. These studies involve
the use of a protocol designed to optimize the manage￾ment of fluids through parameters such as stroke volume
(SV) and flow time corrected (FTc), both during surgery
and for the first 6–8 postoperative hours. The results show
a reduced postoperative length of stay and a decrease in
postoperative morbidity. As a result of these trials, ED￾guided fluid administration has been recommended as
routine for colorectal surgeries in the UK and endorsed by
Medicare and Medicaid Service [55,56].
Few studies investigated the use of other advanced
hemodynamic monitoring tools (such as pulmonary and
trans-pulmonary thermodilution) for intraoperative GDT,
probably because of their invasiveness resulting in limited
use in the operating room. Sandham et al. studied the use
of the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) on patients classi￾fied ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) 3 and 4
but failed to demonstrate benefits regarding length of hos￾pital stay and mortality [57].
In recent years the concept that the oxygen debt leads
to an increased incidence of postoperative complications
(infections, organ failure, etc.) prompted many manufac￾turers to develop alternative less-invasive hemodynamic
devices. The most widespread of these use the uncali￾brated pulse-contour analysis, a technique developed
from the original algorithm described by Wesseling [58],
which calculates CO by assessing the area under the ar￾terial curve (i.e. Vigileo, Edwards Lifescience, Irvine, CA,
USA; Pulsioflex, Pulsion Medical Germany). These in￾struments continually estimate CO and derived parame￾ters, are easy to use and are less invasive. However, they
are also less accurate and precise than those calibrated.
LiDCO rapid (LiDCO, London, UK), is different from
the others as it uses an algorithm based on the pulse
power analysis [59].
Clinical trials that compared the reliability of these un￾calibrated pulse contour analysis systems show conflicting
results [60-63]. In a multicenter study, Salzwedel et al.
have shown that performing hemodynamic optimization
using ProAQT/PulsioFlex (PULSION Medical Systems
SE, Munich, Germany) led to a decrease in postopera￾tive complications in patients undergoing major ab￾dominal surgery [64]. On the other hand Pearse and the
OPTIMISE Study Group were recently unable to demon￾strate any advantage in using GTD in high-risk patients
undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, compared to
standard care [65]. However the inclusion of those data
in an up-to-date meta-analysis (including studies from
1988 to 2013) indicates that the intervention was associ￾ated with a reduction in overall complication rates.
This may be attributed to the fact that the same author,
in a previous study on GDT guided by the calibrated
LiDCO (LiDCO plus system; LiDCO Ltd., Cambridge,
UK), showed improved outcomes after major surgery
[66]. In the last study Pearse and coll. [66] used LiDCO
rapid, which is an uncalibrated thermodilution tech￾nique to measure CO, quite different from LiDCO plus
(that uses calibrated evaluation). However that paper is
the only one that enrolled and studied the highest
number of patients to evaluate outcome with or with￾out GTD (65).
Hemodynamic devices are not interchangeable and
ED-guided fluid therapy has been shown to be super￾ior to a liberal fluid strategy but not to a restrictive ap￾proach [67]. Anyway doubts have been raised on the
quality of the studies supporting the ED in a recent letter
[68], with the conclusion that further studies are ne￾cessary to confirm or refute this evidence.
Della Rocca et al. BMC Anesthesiology 2014, 14:62 Page 4 of 8

We have to mention also the non-invasive technologies:
the Nexfin (BMEye, Edwards Life Sciences, Amsterdam,
The Netherlands) and the Masimo (Masimo Corporation,
Irvine, CA, USA). The Nexfin device uses a finger pneu￾matic cuff to evaluate a continuous non-invasive arterial
pressure curve, through which it estimates the CO by pulse
contour analysis. The Masimo provides a non-invasive es￾timation of the plethysmography variability index (PVI) as
a consequence of variation in peripheral pulse oximetry,
which has been shown to be related to pulse pressure vari￾ation (PPV). PVI is a good predictor of fluid responsive￾ness and has proven to be a reliable indicator in cardiac
and colorectal surgery, but only in the context of a
hemodynamically stable patient [69,70].
What is still missing in the literature is to determine
whether different instruments play different roles and if
different populations of patients (ASA II-III versus IV)
can benefit from these techniques. Finally, what is really
important for GTD is its fundamental (patho) physio￾logical concept: pay the “fluid debt” but also pay it “on
time”, within the intraoperative and first 6–8 postopera￾tive hours.
A recent survey [71] shows that the use of GDT differs
according to the medical and anesthesiological culture
promoted in different settings: it is more widespread in
the UK compared to the Australian/New Zealand. The
majority of the respondents were involved in major ab￾dominal and orthopedic surgery and used GDT in patients
with significant comorbidities. The most significant bar￾riers that hamper the adoption of the GDT were either a
lack of availability of monitoring tools or a lack of experi￾ence with these instruments [72].
There is a long-standing debate on this manipulation
of oxygen delivery in high-risk surgical patients: a thera￾peutic option may be not to stop at the achievement of
the normalization of hemodynamic values, but to go
further and aim for a “supranormal oxygen delivery”,
described as the therapeutic goal of a DO2I > 600 ml/
min/m2. This trend began in the ‘70s and ’80s with the
“milestone” of Shoemaker [73], showing that the in￾duction of a hyperdynamic cardiovascular status was
protective reducing the postoperative morbidity and
mortality. However there is no lack of criticism of this
approach, as it has been revised only by single-center
studies with unintentional bias due to lack of blinding
and different inclusion criteria and definitions. Concern￾ing the complications, the most feared are those related
to invasive monitoring and cardiac complications asso￾ciated with fluid challenges and inotropes administra￾tion. Other studies failed to show any survival benefit
attributable to supranormal GDT [74].
A recent metanalysis has shown that the benefit of
GDT is most pronounced in patients receiving fluid
and inotrope therapy to achieve a supranormal oxygen
delivery target, with the use of minimally invasive cardiac
monitors [75].
Perioperative optimization can be guided by lactates
levels too: the development of an imbalance between oxy￾gen delivery and oxygen consumption, define as oxygen
debt, lead to lactates production above normal levels.

Della Rocca et al. BMC Anesthesiology 2014, 14:62 Page 5 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2253/14/62

Some studies showed that perioperative optimization tar￾geted at lowering lactates levels can reduce post-operative
complications [76].
Summary
Many studies demonstrate that an intraoperative restrict￾ive fluid approach in major surgery improves outcome, re￾duces length of hospital stay, reduces anastomotic leakage
and surgical site infection [5,33-41,77]. In a systematic re￾view of 80 randomized clinical trials, Holte and Kehlet
[78] recommended to avoid fluid overload in major surgi￾cal procedures. The approach to the intraoperative fluid
management is complex and it should be based on human
physiology and the current literature. The steps reported
in Figure 3 represent a rational approach to fluid manage￾ment in ASA I-III patients. The literature evidence avail￾able up to date suggests that GDT should be superior to
the liberal fluid strategy; until there will be evidence that
the GTD is superior or not to the restrictive fluid therapy
the following approach became rational:
 During intraoperative period the anesthetist should
give as many fluids as required by that single
patient. Either hypovolemia, that causes organ
hypoperfusion, and hypervolemia, which increases
postoperative complications, should both be
avoided;
 In all patients ASA I-III undergoing surgery,
excluding cardiac surgery or transplantation surgery,
1 mL/kg/h of crystalloid solution should be given
(if the patient did not observe the overnight fasting
or did not make bowel preparation);
 In fasted patient or those who underwent bowel
preparation, 1–3 mL/kg/h should be given;
 In all ASA IV patients and/or in those who are
undergoing high risk surgery a GDT is strongly
suggested;
 Blood loss has to be replaced only by colloids until
the hemoglobin does not reach a value of 7 g/dL
(if the patient does not have cardiovascular or
respiratory coexisting diseases);
 In case of diuresis monitoring, its total amount will
be replaced by balanced crystalloid solutions (unless
contraindicated);
 In case of hypotension soon after general anesthesia
induction or during intraoperative period, it is
necessary to check anesthesia level and then use
vasopressors before administering fluids;
 In the postoperative period it is mandatory to
restore oral hydratation and feeding as soon as
possible (unless contraindicated).
