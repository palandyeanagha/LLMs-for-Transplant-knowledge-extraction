Abstract
Background: Land Use Regression models (LUR) are useful to estimate the spatial variability of air pollution in
urban areas. Few studies have evaluated the stability of spatial contrasts in outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
concentration over several years. We aimed to compare measured and estimated NO2 levels 12 years apart, the
stability of the exposure estimates for members of a large cohort study, and the association of the exposure
estimates with natural mortality within the cohort.
Methods: We measured NO2 at 67 locations in Rome in 1995/96 and 78 sites in 2007, over three one-week-long
periods. To develop LUR models, several land-use and traffic variables were used. NO2 concentration at each
residential address was estimated for a cohort of 684,000 adults. We used Cox regression to analyze the association
between the two estimated exposures and mortality.
Results: The mean NO2 measured concentrations were 45.4 μg/m3 (SD 6.9) in 1995/96 and 44.6 μg/m3 (SD 11.0) in
2007, respectively. The correlation of the two measurements was 0.79. The LUR models resulted in adjusted R2 of
0.737 and 0.704, respectively. The correlation of the predicted exposure values for cohort members was 0.96. The
association of each 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2 with mortality was 6 % for 1995/96 and 4 % for 2007 LUR models.
The increased risk per an inter-quartile range change was identical (4 %, 95 % CI:3–6 %) for both estimates of NO2.
Conclusions: Measured and predicted NO2 values from LUR models, from samples collected 12 years apart, had
good agreement, and the exposure estimates were similarly associated with mortality in a large cohort study.

Background
Several cohort studies from Europe and North America
have suggested an association between long-term expos￾ure to air pollution and adult mortality for natural
causes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and
lung cancer [1-14]. Despite the number of studies pro￾duced so far, however, the evidence that traffic-related
air pollution is related to mortality has been considered
suggestive but not yet sufficient [15].
A specific challenge in studying the effect of long term
exposure to ambient air pollution is the exposure
assessment. The possible approaches to consider intra￾urban air pollution contrasts include the use of disper￾sion models, interpolation methods, Geographic Infor￾mation System (GIS) proxy measures of traffic exposure,
and land use regression models. The latter methodology
was developed in the SAVIAH (Small Area Variation In
Air quality and Health) study and has become a com￾monly used approach [16-20]. The method consists in
predicting pollution concentrations at a given site using
surrounding characteristics: geographical and land-use
variables such as altitude, population density, meteor￾ology, GIS and traffic flows variables.
The application of the results of the land use regres￾sion model faces a relevant methodological problem
related to the timing of the measurements of exposure.

Since the methodology is relatively recent and because
monitoring is costly, the same estimates from land use
regression models are often used to estimate exposure
contrasts in different time periods. The basic assumption
is that spatial patterns of air pollution change slowly in a
city and that exposure assessment performed today can
be a good surrogate of exposure occurring in the past or
in the future. However, few studies has challenged this
assumption, by comparing the performance of land use
regression models over long time periods with measured
and predicted levels of pollutants within the same area
[18,19]. In addition, there are no available studies that
have evaluated the performance of the exposure esti￾mates from land use regression models taken several
years apart for a resident population, or have investi￾gated the association with mortality.
The present study was designed to fill these gaps. In
particular, we developed two land use regression models
for NO2 in the city of Rome with a time span of 12 years,
and compared them in terms of observed and predicted
values, exposure predictions, and association with mor￾tality for natural causes in a large cohort of adult resi￾dents followed from 2001 to 2006.
Methods
The setting
Rome is the largest Italian city with a population of 2.8
million inhabitants on a surface of 1,290 km2
. It is a ra￾dial city, and the urban development in Rome took place
gradually from the centre to the suburbs, with significant
urbanization in the 1930s, after the second world war,
and in the 1990s [21]. The city is divided into 5,500 cen￾sus blocks with an average population of 470
inhabitants.
Air pollution measurements in 1995–96
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was measured at 70 schools in a
cross sectional study on children conducted in 1995
(Italian Study on Respiratory Diseases and Environ￾ment), the Italian part of the International ISAAC study
[22]. The objective of the measurement campaign was to
estimate average NO2 exposure at schools in Rome and
the 70 schools were a random sample of all primary and
junior high schools of the city (stratified by the 20 city
districts). Three Palmes diffusion tubes, manufactured
by the Emilia–Romagna Environmental Protection
Agency, measured outdoor air pollution in each location
simultaneously over three one-week periods in June
1995, November 1995, and March 1996 [23]. The tubes
were placed outside the school, two meters above
ground, and the mean of the measurements for the three
tubes was considered. The school mean NO2 concentra￾tion over the three periods was considered as an esti￾mate of the annual mean level. Only sites that had
complete data coverage over the three periods were
included, thus 67 sites remained for the analysis [23].
The locations were 44 urban background sites, and 23
traffic sites.
Air pollution measurements in 2007
In 2007, we measured NO2 concentrations using Ogawa
passive samplers at 78 sites during three one-week peri￾ods in February, May, and October. As in the previous
survey, the samplers were positioned within two days
and collected exactly after one week. We selected the
same locations used in 1995/96, and we added 11 sites
to increase the variability of the measurements (3 urban
background, 7 traffic sites, and 1 regional background
site). In fact, we realized that schools selected in 1995/96
were not enough to represent the high variability of NO2
in Rome, and a previous LUR developed with 1995/96
measurements tended to underestimate high values of
NO2 [23]. In 27 locations, we used the same Palmes
tubes and Ogawa samplers to compare the different
measures and calculate a correction factor between the
two methodologies. An Ogawa badge is a passive sam￾pler that collects nitrogen oxides through diffusion on a
pre-coated filter [19,24]. The filter is removed in the la￾boratory and analyzed with a spectrophotometer for
nitrites using a Saltzman reaction. Five lab blanks from
each measurement campaign were kept at our depart￾ment. All the analyses of the Ogawa samplers were per￾formed at the Institute for Risk Assessment Science of
Utrecht University [19]. Field blanks and field duplicates
were taken to document detection limits and precision
of each measurement campaign. The Palmes tubes were
analyzed by the Emilia-Romagna Environmental Protec￾tion Agency.
We assigned to each sampling location a single NO2
level, the mean of the three measurements. The map of
Rome with the sites of measurement is presented in
Figure 1.
Land use and traffic variables
Several land-use and traffic variables were available to
characterize the locations used for air pollution mea￾surements. Traffic flows of 2005 (only for roads with
>4,000 vehicles per day) were provided by the Munici￾pality of Rome and were used for both models. For each
location, we used the variables already chosen to develop
a previous LUR model for Rome [23]: the proximity to
green urban areas (a binary variable, which indicated if
the census block was adjacent to a green urban area,
selected using CORINE land cover data), the altitude,
the size of the census block, the number of residents in
the census block, and the inverse of the population
density for the census block (m2 per person). To in￾crease our predictive ability, we added as linear terms

the distance from the city centre and the geographical
coordinates (X and Y). The city center has the highest
traffic and population density levels and it is expected
that air pollution tends to be higher in the center and
lower in the suburbs so that the distance variable should
capture this aspect. On the other hand, the orography of
the area is peculiar (the Mediterranean Sea at South￾West and the hills towards East and North-East ) and
the prevalent wind direction tend to have a West- East
direction. Therefore, the X and Y coordinates may cap￾ture the influence of orography and wind. In addition,
we considered three GIS variables to characterize the
traffic that surrounds each location: meters of high traf￾fic road (more than 10,000 vehicles/day) within a buffer
of 150 meters, traffic density (number of cars multiplied
by the length of roads within 150 metres divided by the
buffer area), distance from the closest high traffic road.
For sake of simplicity, only one buffer was chosen (150
metres) considering the decay gradients of NO2 with the
distance to high traffic roads [15].
We collected and stored all geographical variables
using ArcGis 9.1 (ESRI, Redlands, California, USA). We
used the Word Geodetic System of 1984 with the Uni￾versal Transverse Mercator 33 N (WGS84 UTM33N) as
the coordinate system and map projection.
The Rome Longitudinal Study (RoLS)
The Rome Longitudinal Study is a cohort based on the
Rome Municipal Register’s data, described in detail else￾where [25]. Briefly, it is a closed prospective cohort of
residents of Rome on the 21st October 2001 with a mor￾tality follow up to the end of 2006. All 2001 residential
addresses were geocoded using the Italian road network
(Tele Atlas, Italy). Several individual socio-demographic
variables at baseline were available for each subject of
the cohort (including the residential history, education,
occupation, place of birth, marital status). In addition,
we used a small-area (census block, average population:
470 inhabitants) composite index of socioeconomic pos￾ition (SEP), built with 2001 Census data [26], to better
characterize social deprivation.
We selected all adults aged 45–80 years in 2001 who
had not changed their residence in the five years preced￾ing enrolment and during the follow-up. We linked sub￾jects to the Regional Mortality Registry, and collected
the date of death and the underlying cause of death
(coded to the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD) revision 9). We evaluated their vital status until
December 2006 and analysed the association between
NO2 exposure (estimated with the two LUR models) and
natural mortality (ICD-9 < 800), taking into account

individual characteristics (age, gender, marital status,
place of birth, education, occupation) and area-based
socioeconomic position, as a surrogate measure of life￾styles and access to health services.
Statistical analysis
We used data from the 27 sites with both Palmes tubes
and Ogawa samplers in 2007, to compare the measures
of ambient NO2 performed with different methods.
Therefore, we applied a correction factor derived from a
linear regression to all 1995/96 Palmes tube measure￾ments in order to align them with the measurements
collected with the Ogawa passive samplers.
We evaluated the correlation between NO2 measure￾ments in 1995/96 and 2007 with the Pearson correlation
coefficient, and their agreement using the Bland-Altman
plot. To build the period-specific LUR models, the asso￾ciation between the logarithmic transformation of NO2
concentrations and each land-use or traffic variable was
assessed by univariate and multiple linear regressions.
We used the logarithmic transformation because the
log-normal NO2 distribution. The final model was con￾structed using a manual backward stepwise elimination
procedure (p > 0.20): we eliminated from the model the
predictors one-by-one on the basis of the highest p￾value. When one of the coordinates was selected, we
kept into the model the other coordinate independently
on its p-value. Variables with a regression slope of op￾posite sign to what was expected were not included; in
other words, we excluded all the variables known to be
positively associated to air pollution, which seemed to
have a negative effect instead.
The validity of the regression models was evaluated by
leave-one-out cross-validation, i.e. by systematically sub￾tracting each of the data points from the model one by
one, and then comparing the predicted value for each
specific point with the measured level at the location
without that value in the model [27]. We plotted mea￾sured and predicted levels from the cross-validation in
1995/96 and 2007, and we calculated the root mean
square errors (RMSE) and R2 of regression analysis be￾tween measured and estimated concentrations. We
checked each model for influential observations, per￾forming the Cook’s distance, for multicollinearity by esti￾mating the variance inflation factor (VIF), and we
calculated the Moran’s Index of residuals, to check their
spatial autocorrelation.
We assessed the ability of LUR models to predict con￾centrations both prospectively (using the 1995/96 model
to predict measured concentrations in 2007), and retro￾spectively (using the 2007 model to predict 1995/96
measured concentrations).
We estimated the NO2 concentrations for all residence
addresses of the participants of the Rome Longitudinal
Study using the two LUR models. We used the Pearson
correlation coefficient to measure the correlation be￾tween the results of the LUR models from 1995/96 with
those from 2007 at all the residential addresses of sub￾jects enrolled in the cohort. We used a test for trend
across ordered groups for comparing levels of NO2
among age and socioeconomic categories, and a t-test
for comparing the exposure levels between genders.
Finally, we applied Cox proportional hazard regression
models to analyse the association between NO2 exposure
(from both LUR models) and natural mortality, while
adjusting for age, gender, marital status, place of birth,
education, occupation and area-based socioeconomic
position. We categorized the predicted NO2 levels into
quintiles and into four pre-specified categories
(<=35 μg/m3
, 35–45 μg/m3
, 45–50 μg/m3
, >50 μg/m3
).
We calculated hazard ratios of natural mortality for
10 μg/m3 NO2 and for interquartile range.
Results
The Pearson correlation coefficient between the mea￾surements taken in 2007 (at the same sites) with Palmes
tubes and those taken with Ogawa samplers in 2007 was
0.92. The following equation, from a linear regression
(R2 = 0.84), was used to calibrate the measures taken in
1995/96 with those taken in 2007: NO2-Ogawa badge =
0.68*NO2-Palmes tube + 13.53
Mean NO2 concentration was 45.4 μg/m3 (SD 6.9) in
1995/96. The mean values were rather similar in 2007,
44.6 μg/m3
, but the standard deviation increased (SD
11.0) partly due to the additional 11 sites added to
the analysis. Restricting the calculation to the original
1995/96 sites, the mean value for 2007 was 42.7 μg/m3
(SD 9.1). The NO2 concentrations slightly decreased
both in traffic and urban background sites (Table 1). The
description of land-use and traffic variables and mean
and standard deviation (SD) of NO2 measures in 1995/
96 and 2007 is presented in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Land use regression models
The univariate and multivariate association between
land-use and traffic variables and the log of NO2 con￾centration at the 67 sites in 1995/96 and at the 78 sites
in 2007 is shown in Table 2. Multiple regression models
indicated that the following variables predicted mea￾sured NO2 in 1995/96: altitude, geographical coordi￾nates, distance from the city centre, inverse population
density of the census block, traffic density in the 150 m
buffer around the site, and distance from the closest
road with more than 10,000 vehicles daily. The best￾fitting multiple regression model resulted in a determin￾ation coefficient (R2
) of 0.737, and a root mean square
error (RMSE) of 0.076 (i.e. 1.09 μg/m3
).

The following variables were associated with NO2 con￾centrations in 2007: altitude, the X-coordinate, distance
from the city centre, size of the census block, and meters
of high traffic road within 150 m of the site. The best￾fitting multiple regression model resulted in a determin￾ation coefficient (R2
) of 0.704, and a RMSE of 0.132
(i.e. 1.14 μg/m3
).
For both models there was no evidence of multicolli￾nearity among the chosen variables or of influential
observations: the mean variance inflation factor was 1.55
(the maximum was 2.08 for Y-coordinate) in 1995/96
and 1.39 (the maximum was 1.92 for Y-coordinate) in
2007, the Cook’s distance was less than 0.3 in both cases.
There was no evidence of spatial autocorrelation of resi￾duals: the p value of Moran’s Index was 0.300 in 1995/
96 and 0.218 in 2007.
Cross-validation of the two models
For the first period, the determination coefficient (R2
),
the adjusted-R2 and the root mean square error of re￾gression analysis between measured and estimated con￾centrations were 0.67, 0.66, and 3.24 respectively.
In 2007, the determination coefficient (R2
), the
adjusted-R2 and the root mean square error of regres￾sion analysis between measured and estimated concen￾trations were 0.61, 0.61, and 5.38 respectively.

Comparison of the 1995/96 and 2007 observed and
predicted levels
Figure 2 shows the scatter plots of the comparison of
the measurements of NO2 concentrations taken at the
same locations in the two study periods (A), the ability
of 1995/96 model to predict 2007 measurements (B), the
ability of 2007 LUR model to predict 1995/96 measure￾ments (C), and the comparison of predicted values of
the two LUR models at the addresses of the study popu￾lation (D). The Pearson correlation coefficient between
the two measurements of ambient NO2 was 0.79, it was
higher for urban background sites (0.83) than for traffic
sites (0.68).
The predictions of 1995/96 LUR model and measure￾ments in 2007 had a correlation of 0.73, while the 2007
LUR predicted levels had a correlation with 1995/96
measurements of 0.83. When we applied the estimates
of NO2 concentration derived from the two LUR models
to the residential addresses of the 684,204 subjects
enrolled into the study, the correlation between the esti￾mated measures in the two periods was 0.96.
NO2 exposure for cohort members
Figure 3 shows the maps of levels of NO2 from the two
land use regression models in Rome. The socio￾demographic characteristics of the study population and
the levels of exposure according to the 1995/96 and
2007 models are presented in Table 3. According to the
1995/96 model, the 684,204 cohort members were
exposed to a mean level of 45.7 μg/m3 (SD 5.9), the level
was slightly higher in women than in men (p < 0.001),
and was higher in the elderly than in the 45–64 year old
population (p-trend < 0.001), and in subjects living in
high compared to low socioeconomic position census
blocks (47.2 vs. 42.9 μg/m3
, p-trend < 0.001). According
to the model developed with 2007 data, similarly to the
1995/96 model, the mean exposure was 43.9 μg/m3
,

position (p-trend < 0.001).
Association with natural mortality
During the study period, a total of 45,006 deaths from
natural causes occurred in the cohort. Table 4 shows the
results of the Cox regression analyses adjusted for sev￾eral confounders. When we considered the quintiles of
the two distributions as the relevant exposures, we
obtained very similar results of increased mortality from
natural causes with increasing quintiles of NO2 at resi￾dence (HR = 1.10, 95%CI:1.06-1.13 in the 5th quintile
compared to the 1st for 1995/96 estimates, and HR =
1.11, 95%CI:1.07-1.14 in the 5th quintile compared to
the 1st for 2007 estimates). There was a similar associ￾ation with natural mortality even when we used a 4-
category variables with a 12 % increased risk of dying
(95%CI: 8–18 %) for those with a concentration of NO2
at residence of more than 50 μg/m3
, compared to those
exposed to less than 35 μg/m3
. The increased mortality
risk for an increase of 10 μg/m3 of NO2 concentration in
1995/96 was 6 % (95%CI:4–8 %), while using NO2 esti￾mates for 2001 it was 4 % (95%CI:3–5 %). This result
was related to the wider variability of NO2
concentrations in 2007; in fact the hazard ratios of mor￾tality for an increase of NO2 corresponding to the inter￾quartile range was 1.04 (95%CI: 1.03-1.06) for both
periods.
Discussion
We documented the stability of NO2 measurements and
predicted levels of exposure by two LUR models twelve
years apart. The NO2 concentrations measured in the
same locations had a good agreement, showing the sta￾bility of spatial contrast. This study shows that 74 % and
70 % of the NO2 variability in Rome in 1995/96 and in
2007, respectively, is explained by land use and traffic
variables. The 2007 LUR model was able to predict NO2
levels measured 12 years before in a better way than
what the 1995/96 model was able to do prospectively
(r = 0.83 vs. 0.73). When we applied the estimated NO2
from the two LUR models to residential addresses of the
large cohort members, the correlation was extremely
high (0.96). The association between NO2 exposure at
residence and mortality from 2001 to 2006 was very
similar using the 1995/96 and the 2007 models.
The choice of sites for measurements was driven by
the 1995/96 campaign which aimed to investigate the

level of exposure of children at school. The schools, ran￾domly selected, were placed mostly in urban background
sites (44/67). We did notice that the prediction from the
LUR model underestimated to some extent the highest
levels of NO2 [23]. On the other hand, 17 % of the resi￾dents in the city live at less than 50 metres from a high
traffic road, which means that a significant proportion of
residents is not represented by urban background loca￾tions [25]. Therefore, to better characterize the variabil￾ity of NO2 in the city we added 11 sites (7 high traffic
locations) in the second measurement campaign. Poten￾tial consequences of this choice were a lower R2 of the
2007 LUR model and a poorer ability of the 1995/96
model to predict the 2007 measurements compared to
the performance of the 2007 model to predict the obser￾vations retrospectively. On the other hand, the R2 of the
models were comparable to those developed in other
settings that went from 0.51 to 0.90 [17], and were better
than the one we developed a few years ago (R2 was 0.69)
when data on vehicular traffic were not available [23].
A slight decrease in air pollution was noticed when
comparing the results of the two surveys, and it oc￾curred both in traffic and in urban background sites.
Data from fixed monitors of the Regional Environmental
Protection Agency show in the period 1999–2008 a
small decrease in NO2 concentrations in traffic sites,
and a stability in urban background sites [28].
Few studies have been conducted on the stability of
small-area spatial contrasts over time using LUR models
and they corroborate our findings. In Oslo, Madsen and
colleagues found a good agreement in spatial contrasts
over a three year period. [18] In the Netherlands, Eeftens
and colleagues showed good agreement in measured and
modelled levels of NO2 eight years apart [19].
The prediction of NO2 levels to the studied population
indicates that traffic-related air pollution in Rome is not
evenly distributed throughout the population: we found

higher levels of exposure in the oldest age group, and in
the higher socioeconomic compared to the lower socioe￾conomic census blocks. This is not surprising as other
local studies have shown the same pattern, which is
related to the urbanization history of Rome, with the
elderly and well-off population more likely to live in the
prestigious and well-travelled city centre than in the per￾iphery [25,29]. Although the common belief is that low
socioeconomic groups of the population are disadvan￾taged from all points of view, air quality included, this
idea has been contradicted also by studies conducted in
Canada and the Netherlands [6,30].
The mortality - NO2 association was identical using
the two LUR models in all circumstances: when using
quintiles of the distribution, categories of NO2 concen￾tration, and the inter-quartile range. However, the effect
was slightly lower with the 2007 model compared to
1995/96 when we calculated the association with natural
mortality for a 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2 and this is at￾tributable to the lower estimated variability in 1995/96.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that our estimates of the
strength of the association between NO2 and mortality
were similar to findings in other settings [1,3,5].
This study has some limitations. We used two differ￾ent methods to measure NO2 concentrations: Palmes
tubes and Ogawa badges. Although we took it into ac￾count, calibrating the 1995/96 levels, we introduced
some level of error: 16 % of variance in measurements
taken using Ogawa samplers was unexplained by Palmes
tube measurements. Moreover, we assigned a correction
factor based only on one week of measurements, while it
could change in different weather conditions. In each
campaign we used as a single measure of NO2 concen￾tration the mean of the three measurements in the same
site, without taking account of variation during the year.
The mean concentration of NO2 during the first meas￾urement period in urban background fixed monitors was
47.0 μg/m3
, comparable to our mean of 45.5 μg/m3 [23].
Data were not available to adjust 1995/96 measurements
for temporal trends and for this reason we have not
done it neither for 2007. However, during the three
weeks of measurements in 2007 at the city background
monitoring station the average concentration of NO2
was 44.9 μg/m3 (SD 14.6) and was comparable to the an￾nual average concentration we estimated (43.9 μg/m3
,
SD 14.6). An important limit of our models is that traffic
data were available only for major roads (i.e. >4000
vehicles/day), and they were estimated using an inte￾grated data monitoring and evaluation system developed
under the Heaven European project (heaven.rec.org).
Moreover, period-specific data on traffic were not avail￾able as we used for both models the same 2005 traffic
data. The only time-specific variables were those related
to population. For the cohort analysis, we did study
subjects who did not move since five years before the
enrolment to the end of the follow-up. This is a strength
of the study and in Rome the majority of adult popula￾tion is rather stable and the percentage of those aged
45–80 years who change the address during ten years is
15 % and decrease with increasing age. For these reasons
we believe that our mortality analysis is valid. The co￾hort we used is based on administrative data, and infor￾mation on important risk factors and potential
confounders such as obesity, smoking, diet are not avail￾able. However, we were interested on comparing the ef￾fect of the two estimates from LUR models on the same
population, than measuring the effect estimates of air
pollution exposure on mortality. In fact we wanted to in￾vestigate to what extent we can use exposure models
based on measurements taken after the settlement of the
epidemiologic study.
Conclusions
Rome is a city with slow changes in terms of
urbanization and traffic volumes, hence it is possible to
use current LUR models to estimate contrasts in air pol￾lution exposure even if they refer to a long time before.
We have shown that land use regression models for
NO2, developed with independent measurement data
collected 12 years apart, produced very similar results
and were similarly associated with increased mortality in
a large population study.
