Abstract
The antifungal agents most frequently used in prophylaxis and
treatment are amphotericin B (and its new lipid forms) and azoles
such as fluconazole, itraconazole, and more recently voriconazole.
This review assesses the role of itraconazole in paediatric
haematology/oncology practice. Its broader spectrum of activity
and availability in oral and intravenous forms allow a flexible
approach in the management of fungal infections.
•  itraconazole
•  invasive fungal infections
•  prophylaxis
•  GVHD, graft versus host disease
•  IFI, invasive fungal infections
