This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of EGb761, a Ginkgo Biloba extract, against 
brain death-induced kidney injury. Sixty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into six 
groups: sham, brain-death (BD), BD+EGb b48h (48hours before BD), BD+EGb 2h (2hours after BD), 
BD+EGb 1h, and BD+EGb 0.5h. Six hours after BD, serum sample and kidney tissues were collected 
for analyses. The levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine significantly elevated in the 
BD group than in sham group. In all the EGb761-treated BD animals except for the BD+Gb 2h group, 
the levels of BUN and serum creatinine significantly reduced (all P<0.01). EGb761 attenuated tubular 
injury and lowered the histological score. In addition, the longer duration of drug treatment was, the 
better protective efficacy could be observed. EGb761 significantly reduced IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, 
MCP-1, IP-10 mRNA expression and macrophage infiltration in the kidney. EGb761 treatment at 48hour 
before brain death significantly attenuate the levels of p-JNK-MAPK, p-p38-MAPK, and p-STAT3 
proteins (all P<0.05, compared to BD group). In summary, our data showed that EGb761 treatment 
protected donor kidney from BD-induced damages by blocking SAPK and JAK-STAT signalings. Early 
administration of EGb761 can provide better protective efficacy.
Kidney transplantation is current most optimal therapy for patients with irreversible chronic kidney failure, 
which can significantly prolong survival and improve quality of life of patients1
. However, organ transplantation 
is severely limited by the donor availability. Since the Harvard criteria for brain death has been introduced in 
1968 2
, donation after brain death (DBD) has been being routinely performed in many countries. Although dona￾tion after cardiac death has been gradually increasing recently, DBD remains the main source of donor grafts in 
many countries at present3
. It is generally accepted that the quality of grafts plays a crucial role in the transplan￾tation outcome4
. Particularly, compared to living-donor kidney transplantations, patients received kidneys from 
deceased donors have been shown to be of a significantly lower long-term patients and graft survival rate5,6. Brain 
death usually results from massive acute cerebral injury, induces systemic vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion of 
multiple organs, and eventually causes ischemia-hyperoxia injury in the donor kidneys7,8. The pathophysiological

alterations also triggers a cascade of hemodynamic, inflammatory, and immunologic events9–11. Therefore, devel￾oping strategies for protection of BD-induced kidney injury are urgently required, which would help to improve 
the graft quality and the outcome of graft transplantation.
Immunohistochemical study of kidney biopsies have found that the elevated level of neutrophil infiltration 
and P-selectin expression were detected after reperfusion in deceased donor kidney grafts, which was associated 
with long cold ischemia times and delayed graft function, indicating that early inflammatory events account for 
the poor outcome of kidneys derived from deceased donors12. Hence, ischemic and inflammatory injuries are 
considered to be the two main contributors for brain death-induced kidney injury. Accordingly, a variety of strat￾egies aiming to overcome these two targets have been developed to prevent brain death-induced kidney injury. 
For instance, cardiovascular support strategies including pretreatment of dopamine13 and catecholamine14, as well 
as anti-inflammatory strategies including pretreatment of recombinant soluble P-selectin glycoprotein ligand15, 
steroid16, carbamylated erythropoietin17, sodium nitrite18 and induction of heme oxygenase 119 have been adopted 
to improve the quality of graft.
Ginkgo biloba is a kind of medicinal herb used in traditional Chinese medicine for several thousand years. 
EGb761 is a compound extracted from Ginko biloba leafs that consists of two active components; a flavonoid gly￾coside and terpene lactone20. The toxicological and pharmacological properties of EGb761 are well-characterized. 
A number of preclinical studies have suggested neuroprotective effects for EGb76121,22, and it have been widely 
used in prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia in elder individuals23. The molecular mech￾anisms of neuroprotective effects of EGb761 are of multiple-aspects, including anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammatory, 
protecting mitochondria24, etc. Accumulating evidences also demonstrate that EGb761 possesses good protective 
effect on cardiovascular diseases25–27. Recent study showed that EGb761 exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by 
inhibiting several pro-inflammatory mediators and signaling pathways28. In addition, EGb761 has been shown 
to be capable of reducing ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal injury in rats model29. Song et al. have also 
demonstrated that EGb761 possesses the protective effect against cisplatin-induced renal injury in rats model30.
All the above findings suggest that EGb761 may have potential beneficial effects against brain death-induced 
kidney injury. However, the feasibility of application of EGb761 on pharmacologic donor management is still 
unknown. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of EGb761 are still not 
fully understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of EGb761 against 
brain-death induced kidney injury and the underlying molecular mechanism of the protective effect. Adopting 
a rat model of brain death, the protective effect of EGb761 was demonstrated. We also demonstrated evidences 
supporting that JAK-STAT and SAPK signalings were involved in the protective effect of EGb761.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Sixty male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aging 16–20 weeks and weighing 350–400 g were randomly 
assigned into six groups; the sham operated group (sham), the brain death group (BD), BD+EGb b48h (injected 
with EGb761 at 48 hours before BD), BD+​ EGb 2 h (injected with EGb761 at 2 hours after BD), BD+​ EGb 1 h, 
and BD+EGb 0.5h. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of 
the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and all experiments were carried out in accordance with 
relevant guidelines, including any relevant details.
Brain death model of rat and EGb761 treatment. Animals were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 
chloral hydrate and then the left femoral artery was cannulated. The cannula was connected to a pressure trans￾ducer and used to continuously monitor blood pressure. A tracheotomy was performed, followed by intratracheal 
intubation. A hole was made in the skull at the left frontal bone 0.3 cm from the sagittal line. A Fogarty tube 
was inserted outside of the dura mater, and the tip was pointed in the caudal direction. The tube was stabilized 
for 30 min, and normal saline was injected into the balloon with a micro-infusion pump (RWD252, RWD Life 
Science Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China) at a speed of 40 μL/min until breathing stopped. Mechanical ventilation was 
immediately initiated at a respiratory rate of 100/min and tidal volume of 2.0mL with a small animal ventilator 
(HX-100E, Taimeng Software Co. LTD, Chengdu, China). Respiratory arrest and the disappearance of the cor￾neal reflex and pupillary light reflex were used to determine brain death. Mechanical ventilation was provided 
for another 6h after brain death. When the mean arterial pressure was reduced to 80mmHg, normal saline was 
retracted to reduce the balloon until blood pressure recovered. The body temperature was maintained at 38.0°C. 
In the sham group, a hole was made at the skull without insertion of a balloon tube and mechanical ventilation 
was provided for 6h after the hole was made.
The animals treated with EGb761 received 50mg/kg injected into the penile vein at 48hours before surgery to 
induce brain death and 0.5, 1 and 2hours after brain death, respectively. In the BD and sham groups, an equiva￾lent volume of normal saline was injected at the same time points.
Specimen Collection. After 6 h of mechanical ventilation, the abdominal aorta was punctured, and the 
blood was collected into a procoagulant inert gel tube. The inferior vena cava was opened, and normal saline 
(30mL) was injected from the cephalic end of the aorta to flush both kidneys. The left kidney was removed, and 
its cortex was harvested. A fraction of the cortex was stored at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde–2% paraformaldehyde 
in 0.1mol/L PBS, and the remaining cortex was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The right kidney was divided along 
the sagittal plane and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
Serum creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) assay. Blood sample was centrifuged at 1000g 
for 10min, and the supernatant was harvested. Serum Cr and BUN was measured by dry chemistry with an auto￾matic biochemical analyzer (7180, Hitachi, Ibaraki-ken, Japan).

Histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment. Paraformaldehyde-fixed kidney 
was used to prepare paraffin-embedded tissue sample. The paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5-μm thick) were 
stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) or immunochemistry staining (IHC) (anti-CD68 mAb, Cat. ab31630, 
Abcam, USA), and observed under a light microscope (Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). For histopathological 
assessment, representative images were captured with a camera (DS-U1, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with 
the ACT-2U image analysis software (version: 1.40.85.221, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Tubular injury was evaluated 
independently by two pathologists blinded to the treatments. Ten fields were randomly selected at a magnifi￾cation of 400× and 10 tubules were selected from within each field. The scoring was performed as previously 
described31. Briefly, slides were evaluated based on the presence and extent of tubular epithelial cell flattening 
(1 point), brush border loss or shedding (1 or 2 points), the presence of a cast (2 points), and caducous necrotic 
cells without formation of cast or cell debris (1 point). For IHC assessment, ten fields were randomly selected 
from the slide of each animal at a magnification of 400×, and the number of positively stained cells was counted. 
Six rats were evaluated for IHC staining in each group.
Transmission electron microscopy. Glutaraldehyde-fixed tissues were fixed in osmic acid, dehydrated in 
ethanol, and embedded. The tissue was cut into 0.05-μm sections and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. 
These sections were observed under a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2
 Spirit Twin, FEI, Brno, Czech 
Republic), and representative images were captured.
Real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from kidney using E.Z.N.A.TM Total RNA Kit II 
(R6931-01, Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcrip￾tion was performed using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TakaRa, Dalian, China). Real-time PCR was 
performed using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTMII reagent (TakaRa) in a real-time quantitative thermal cycler 
(7900HT, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the following cycle conditons: an initial dena￾turation step (95 °C for 30 s), followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C for 5 s) and annealing-extension 
(60 °C for 30 s), with a final melt-curve stage (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C for 15 s). GAPDH 
served as an internal reference, and data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primers for the tar￾get genes were: IL-1β, CCCTGAACTCAACTGTGAAATAGCA and CCCAAGTCAAGGGCTTGGAA; 
IL-6, ATTGTATGAACAGCGATGATGCAC and CCAGGTAGAAACGGAACTCCAGA; TNF-α, 
TCAGTTCCATGGCCCAGAC and GTTGTCTTTGAGATCCATGCCATT; monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1), CTATGCAGGTCTCTGTCACGCTTC and CAGCCGACTCATTGGGATCA; and CXCL10 
(IP-10), TTATTGAAAGCGGTGAGCCAAAG and GCTGTCCATCGGTCTCAGCA. The primers for GAPDH 
were GGCACAGTCAAGGCTGAGAATG and ATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGTA.
Western blot analysis. Total protein was extracted from the kidney tissues snap frozen in liquid nitrogen 
using RIPA lysis buffer [50 mM Tris (Ph 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% 
SDS, sodium orthovanadate, sodium fluoride, EDTA, and leupeptin] containing PMSF and phosphatase inhib￾itor (Forevergen, Guangzhou, China). The lysates were separated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked with blocking 
buffer (Beyotime, Haimen, China) at room temperature and then incubated with one of the following primary 
antibodies:
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (D3Z2G) (Cat. 12640, CST, USA), Phospho-STAT3 
(Tyr705) (Cat. 9145), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (D13E1) (Cat. 8690), phospho-p38 MAPK 
(Thr180/Tyr182) (Cat. 9215), SAPK/JNK (Cat. 9252), phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (Cat. 4671). The 
membranes where then washed with TBST and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-affinity-purified 
Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+​ L) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, 
PA, USA) for 1–2 h. Visualization was performed using chemiluminescence (Pluslight ECL Kit, Forevergen, 
Guangzhou, China). The representative images were captured and analyzed with the Quantity one software 
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The optical density of the bands was determined. The expression of the target 
proteins was normalized to an internal control, GAPDH (D16H11) (Cat. 8884). All the antibodies were from Cell 
Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (Chicago, 
Illinois, USA). Data were expressed as mean±​ standard deviation. A one-way analysis of variance was used to 
compare among groups. When a significant difference was observed, post-hoc comparisons between two groups 
were performed. When variance was homogenous, the LSD test was used to compare between two groups. When 
variance was heterogeneous, the Dunnett’s T3 test was employed to compare between two groups. A value of 
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
EGb761 attenuated brain death-induced renal injury. To address if the animal model of brain death 
induced kidney damage was successfully established and the effect of EGb761 on brain death-induced renal 
injury, we evaluated renal injury and function among groups. The results showed that BUN (Fig. 1A) and serum 
Cr (Fig. 1B) levels were significantly elevated in BD group than in sham group (both P<​ 0.01), suggesting renal 
injury in response to brain death. Compared to BD group, the BUN and serum Cr levels were significantly 
reduced in all EGb761-treated animals (all P<​ 0.01) except for the BD+​ EGb 2 h group. In addition, the tim￾ing of EGb761 injection seemed to be associated with the protective efficacy of EGb761. Among four EGb761-
treated groups, the orders of BUN and serum Cr levels (from low to high) were BD+EGb b48h, BD+EGb 0.5h, 
BD+EGb 1h and BD+EGb 2h, although the differences between groups did not always reach significance.

Next, we compared the histological findings in kidney tissue among six groups. As shown in Fig. 2A, the image 
of the sham group exhibited an intact epithelial cell layer, and there was no tubule dilation, interstitial edema 
and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In addition, the brush border at the free side of the proximal convoluted 
tubule and longitudinal striation at the basement side was apparent. In contrast, the brain death group had dilated 
tubules containing granular casts, and apparent loss of tubular epithelial cells from the brush border, and some 
cells even had disintegrated (Fig. 2B). In the four EGb761-treated groups, the BD-induced injures were relieved in 
varying degrees as compared with BD group (Fig. 2C–F). The casts and brush border injury were also observed, 
but to a lesser extent than detected in the brain death group. The tubular injury score for six groups was shown 
in Fig. 2G. BD group had a highest injury score while sham group had a lowest one among six groups. Treatment 
with EGb761 significantly reduced the sore in brain death rats (except for BD+EGb 2h group, all P<0.01), and 
the order of scores and significances were consistent with those in the level of serum Cr.
The renal tissues were further evaluated with transmission electron microscopy. In sham group, the mito￾chondria exhibited intact structure, dark matrix and normal mitochondrial cristae. There was abundant endo￾plasmic reticulum with well-arranged structure (Fig. 3A). In BD group, the mitochondria showed swelled and 
had no intact structure, the matrix was blurred, and the structure of mitochondrial cristae was unclear. The 
endoplasmic reticulum was damaged and the structure became disorder (Fig. 3B). While in four EGb761-treated 
groups (Fig. 3C–F), the damages of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum were relieved in varying degrees as 
compared with BD group. In addition, the degree of recovery elevated with the increase of the duration of drug 
treatment.
Taken together, all these results suggested that the animal model of brain death-induced renal injury was 
successfully established, and EGb761 possessed protective effect against brain death-induced renal injury. Early 
administration of EGb761 can provide better protective efficacy.
EGb761 downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced mac￾rophage infiltration. To investigate the possible mechanism underlying protective effect of EGb761 against 
brain death-induced renal injury, we determine the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines in renal tissue since 
EGb761 has been shown to possess good anti-inflammation properties32. As shown in Fig. 4, BD group had sig￾nificantly higher expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and chemokines MCP-1 
and IP-10 (P<​ 0.01) as compared with sham group. However, in four groups of EGb761-treated animals, the 
expression levels of IL-1β (except for BD+​ EGb 2 h, all P<​ 0.01), IL-6 (all P<​ 0.05), and TNF-α (except for 
BD+​ EGb 2h, all P<​ 0.05), MCP-1 (except for BD+​ EGb 2h, all P<​ 0.05) and IP-10 (all P<​ 0.01) significantly 
reduced as compared to BD group. In addition, the trends of reduced levels were consistently associated with the 
drug treatment time among all the five pro-inflammatory cytokines.
To further confirm if macrophage infiltration in the kidney tissue was involved in the brain death-induced 
kidney injury, IHC assessment was performed to evaluate the extent of the CD68+ macrophages infiltration in 
the kidneys of animals (Fig. 5A–F). The CD68+ cell count significantly elevated in BD group as compared with 
sham group (P<0.01, Fig. 5G). The extent of the macrophage infiltration significantly reduced in all four groups 
of EGb761-treated brain death animals as compared with BD groups (all P <​ 0.05), and the trends of reduced 
macrophage infiltration were consistent with those of the decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taken 
together, these data suggested that anti-inflammation properties of EGb761 may contribute to its protective effect.
EGb761 inhibited SAPK and the JAK-STAT signalings. Next we further elucidated the molecular 
mechanism underlying protective effect of EGb761. Given the role of the JAK/STAT and SAPK pathways in 
inflammation and their connection to brain death induced peripheral organ damage, we assessed the phospho￾rylation state of key proteins in these intracellular signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 6A,B, protein levels 
of p-JNK-MAPK (P<​ 0.001), p-p38-MAPK (P=​ 0.05), and p-STAT3 (P<​ 0.001) were significantly elevated in 
the BD group than in sham group. In addition, EGb761 treatment at 48 hours before brain death significantly 
reduced the levels of p-JNK-MAPK (P<0.01), p-p38-MAPK (P<0.05), and p-STAT3 (P<0.01) as compared to 
BD group. However, in the three groups of BD rats receiving EGb761 after brain death, no significant differences 
was observed in p-JNK-MAPK (all P>​ 0.05), p-p38-MAPK (all P>​ 0.05), and p-STAT3 (all P>​ 0.05 except for 
BD+EGb 0.5h group) as compared with BD group. There were no significant differences in the expression levels

of total JNK-MAPK (P=​ 0.9996), p38-MAPK (P=​ 0.140), and STAT3 (P=​ 0.0749) among six groups (Fig. 6A,B). 
These data suggested that EGb761 treatment at 48hours before brain death significantly inhibited SAPK and the 
JAK-STAT signalings, which may account for its protective effect.
Discussion
In the current study, we evaluated the protective effect of EGb761 against brain death-induced kidney injury 
using a rat model of brain death. EGb761 treatment markedly reduced BUN and serum Cr level in the brain 
death rats. Both histological and transmission electron microscopy examinations demonstrated that EGb761 
treatment significantly reduced brain death-induced injury in kidney tissues. Meanwhile, tubular injury score was 
also significantly reduced in EGb761-treated brain death rats. Comparing the data among four EGb761-treated 
demonstrated that the longer duration of drug treatment was, the better protective efficacy could be observed. 
In addition, RT-PCR data showed that EGb761 downregulated the expression of several pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, MCP-1 and IP-10, as well as reduced macrophage infiltration in kid￾ney tissue. Furthermore, western blot results showed that EGb761 treatment at 48hours before brain death sig￾nificantly inhibited SAPK and the JAK-STAT signaling in kidney tissues. Taken together, our findings suggested 
that EGb761 has the protective effect against brain death-induced kidney injury by inhibiting pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and the SAPK and JAK-STAT signalings. Early administration of EGb761 can provide better protective 
efficacy.
Brain death is a catastrophic event in the central nervous system, and is usually accompanied by extensive 
clinically significant changes in hemodynamics, systemic inflammation, endocrine disturbance, and severe renal 
injury. The combination of these processes markedly affects the structure and function of peripheral organs10. 
To better understand the mechanisms underlying this process, we established a progressive brain death model 
where the mean arterial pressure was maintained at or above 80mmHg during the 4h brain death. In the brain 
death animals, increased serum Cr and pathological tubular injury were observed, accompanied by increased 
pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and chemokine (MCP-1 and IP-10) mRNA expression, 
suggesting the animal model was successful established and a clear role for inflammation in brain-death induced 
kidney damage.
The protective effect of EGb761 on renal I/R injury has been shown in previous studies. Sener et al. have 
reported that Ginkgo biloba extract EGb treatment ameliorates I/R-induced abnormalities, including alterations 
of several reactive oxygen metabolites biochemical indices, as well as histopathological morphology29. Likewise, 
Akdere et al. also demonstrated that EGb761 pretreatment significantly reduces tissue malondyaldehyde (MDA), 
catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and tissue damage in kidney tissue of I/R injured rats25. 
Although these findings suggest the protective potential of EGb761 on brain death-induced renal injury, how￾ever, its protective effect has not been investigated yet. To our best knowledge, this is the first study demonstrated 
the feasibility of application of EGb761 on pharmacologic donor management and the underlying molecular 
mechanism.
Figure 4. EGb761 reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in renal tissue of 
brain death rats. Real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1 
and IP-10 from renal tissue. The expression levels were normalized to GAPDH.

In previous studies, the effective dose of EGb761 for oral or intraperitoneal administration in different animal 
models generally range from 50mg/kg to 200mg/kg33–36. It has been shown that the in vivo bioavailability of oral 
administration of EGb761 is approximately 80%37, indicating that oral administration will result in a slightly 
lower serum level of EGb761 as compared with intravenous injection. In a rat model of I/R-induced renal injury 
by Sener et al., EGb761 exhibited its protective effect by intraperitoneal injection with a dose of 50mg/kg twice 
before ischemia and reperfusion, respectively29. We chose intravenous administration with a dose of 50 mg/kg 
of EGb761 with the purposes to appropriately increase the in vivo bioavailability and to avoid the adverse effects 
caused by excessive drug dosage in animals.
Our data suggested that timing of administration is crucial for the protective efficacy of EGb761. In clinical 
practice, the time interval between confirmed diagnosis of brain death and donor organ procurement is typi￾cally longer than 6 hours, providing a good opportunity for using EGb761 to protect the donor kidney. Based 
on our results, earlier administration of EGb761 can achieve a better protection. The best protective efficacy was 
observed in the animals injected with EGb761 at 48hours before brain death. EGb761 is a clinical used drug and 
possesses neuroprotective effect for patients with cerebrovascular disease38. For critical ill patients in the intensive 
care unit, EGb761 could be used to improve the patient’s condition, which could provide potential protection on 
the donor kidney before confirmed diagnosis of brain death. This is the rationale for our experimental design 
of BD+​ EGb b48h group. In addition, the rat model of brain death usually can be maintained up to 4–6 hours, 
which limits us to observe the long-term protective effect of EGb761. The BD+​ EGb b48h group can provide 
the data for evaluating the long-term protective effects of EGb761. Several intracellular signaling pathways have 
been identified to be involved in brain death-induced injury to peripheral organs. Bulcao et al. have demon￾strated that the expression level of phosphorylated STAT3 increases up to five-fold in DBD grafts with donor 
heart dysfunction as compared to normal grafts39. Takahiro et al. showed that pretreatment of p38 MAPK inhib￾itor specifically inhibits p38-MAPK level in lung tissue and reduces serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain 
death animals40. Regarding brain death induced-renal injury, it has been shown that MAP-kinases-mediated 
Figure 5. EGb761 reduced macrophage infiltration in brain death animals. IHC assessment was utilized 
to evaluate the extent of the CD68+macrophages infiltration in the kidneys of animals. Representative IHC 
staining images of CD68+ cells of sham (A), BD (B), BD+EGb b48h (C), BD+EGb 2h (D), BD+EGb 1h 
(E), and BD+EGb 0.5h (F) groups were shown at a magnification of 400×. (G) The extent of macrophages 
infiltration was quantified by CD68+ cell count. Six rats for each group, and ten fields from slide of each animal 
were count.

inflammatory responses and NF-kappaB play a crucial role in the injury mechanism41. Previous study using pig 
model of brain death found that two major stress-activated protein kinases, JNKs and p-38 are involved in the 
brain death-induced kidney injury42. In addition, JNK and p38 has been shown to be involved in pathogenesis of 
several renal diseases, including acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis, and diabetic nephropathy through induc￾ing inflammation and apoptosis43. In this study, we observed an elevated phosphorylation level of JNK-MAPK 
and p38-MAPK in the kidney tissue of brain death rats, suggesting that these signaling pathways were involved in 
the brain death-induced kidney damage. In addition, EGb761 pretreatment significantly reduced the phospho￾rylation levels, indicating that the protective effects of EGb761 against brain death-induced renal injury were, at 
least partially, mediated by inhibiting the SAPK signaling pathways.
The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is widely involved in sensing cellular stress, the inflammatory response, 
and immune regulation44. In patients with severe brain trauma and brain death, a large amount of IL-6 is released 
into the circulation45. Circulating IL-6 will binds to the gp130 receptor on cells, leading to the activation of the 
JAK-STAT signaling pathway46. In the current study, an increased level of phosphorylated STAT3, but not total 
STAT3 was observed in the kidney tissue of brain death rats, confirming that JAK-STAT signaling was activated. 
In addition, EGb761 treatment significantly inhibited JAK-STAT signaling, suggesting this signaling contributed 
to the protective effect of EGb761 agianst renal injury after brain death. Taken together, our findings suggested 
that SAPKs and the JAK-STAT pathways were involved in brain death-induced renal injury by evoking inflamma￾tory responses, and these two signaling were involved in the molecular mechanism underlying protective effect of 
EGb761. Our results also suggested that strategy targeting to specific intracellular signaling pathways might have 
the potential to protect organs from brain death-induced damages.
There are still some limitations in this study. Firstly, although EGb761 attenuated brain death-induced kid￾ney injury, the damages were not fully rescued as compared to sham group, indicating the donor management 
method of EGb761 pretreatment still has room for further improvement. Secondly, we did not further investi￾gate the outcome of kidney transplantation from EGb761-treated DBD donors to comprehensively evaluate the 
Figure 6. EGb761 inhibits SAPK and JAK-STAT signalings in the kidneys of brain death rats. (A) The 
expression and phosphorylation status of JNK-MAPK, p-38-MAPK, and STAT3 in renal tissue were assessed

protective effect of EGb761. Thirdly, although we found that EGb761 treatment inhibited SAPK and JAK-STAT 
signalings, we did not investigate the comprehensive molecular mechanism. In particular, previous studies have 
suggested that there are association between SAPK and JAK-STAT signaling47,48, which is worthy to be further 
investigated. All these limitations should be considered in the following study.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that EGb761 can protect renal from brain death-induced damage by 
inhibiting the inflammatory response and SAPK and JAK-STAT signaling in rats. Early administration of EGb761 
can provide better protective efficacy, which may improve the outcome of kidney transplantation. Further studies 
are required to validate these findings.
