Prostaglandins and their precursors
Since the discovery in 1991 of a second isoform of
prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS, or
cyclooxygenase), there has been considerable interest in
the question of why two isoforms of this enzyme are
necessary and what roles they might play. PGHS-1–
deficient (1) and PGHS-2–deficient (2, 3) mice and iso￾form-specific inhibitors have been developed and used
to investigate the physiological functions of PGHS-1
and PGHS-2. These studies suggest that there are
processes in which each isozyme is uniquely involved
(e.g., platelet aggregation for PGHS-1, ovulation for
PGHS-2) and others in which both isozymes function
coordinately (e.g., carcinogenesis, inflammation).
There are also physiological events in which one PGHS
isozyme normally functions but for which the other
can compensate when the first is lacking (e.g., parturi￾tion and remodeling of the ductus arteriosus). Bio￾chemical studies indicate that each isoform can func￾tion independently; namely, that there are distinct
PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 prostanoid biosynthetic path￾ways. Thus, the unique physiological roles for each
isozyme can be rationalized by what is known about
the biochemistry of the enzymes.
To facilitate discussion of the physiological functions
of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 and to point out those func￾tions for which PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 can substitute for
one another, we describe the following in sequence: (a)
physiological processes that depend solely or primarily
on PGHS-1, (b) physiological processes that depend sole￾ly or primarily on PGHS-2, and (c) processes in which
both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are involved and act coordi￾nately. We then summarize the biochemical evidence for
distinct PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 biosynthetic pathways.
Physiological processes for which 
PGHS-1 is responsible
Platelet aggregation. Mature platelets are essentially non￾nucleated cellular vesicles that mediate hemostasis by
aggregating in response to arterial injury. Platelets can
form thromboxane A2 (TXA2) from arachidonic acid
(AA) supplied either exogenously or generated from
endogenous phospholipid stores (see Brash, this Per￾spective series, ref. 4). TXA2 exits the cells and acts via
the platelet TXA2 receptor (TP) to initiate platelet shape
changes and subsequent platelet aggregation (5). TXA2
can also act via TP receptors to cause constriction of vas￾cular smooth muscle (5). Platelets express PGHS-1 but
not PGHS-2. Thus, TXA2 is formed by platelets only via
PGHS-1 (see Table 1) (6). Not surprisingly, platelets
from PGHS-1–null mice fail to undergo AA-induced
aggregation (1), indicating that PGHS-2 cannot com￾pensate for an absence of PGHS-1 in platelets. Low-dose
aspirin, used therapeutically as an anti-thrombogenic
agent, targets platelet PGHS-1 (7).
Parturition. The PGHS isozymes play distinct physio￾logical roles in female reproduction. Early studies
demonstrated that PGHS-1–null female mice produced
litters of normal size but had difficulty with parturi￾tion (1), whereas other aspects of the reproductive
process in PGHS-1–null mice were normal (8). Gross et
al. (9) also found that the onset of parturition was
delayed in PGHS-1–null mice and observed that
administration of PGF2α resulted in the onset of labor,
suggesting that PGHS-1 is the source of the PGF2α
(Table 1). However, treatment with LPS, a bacterial
component that induces cellular responses associated
with septicemia, induces PGHS-2 and allows parturi￾tion to proceed, even in PGHS-1–null mice. Use of SC￾236, a PGHS-2–selective nonsteroidal anti-inflamma￾tory drug (NSAID), blocks the onset of parturition in
these LPS-treated mice (10). Thus, under certain patho￾logical conditions, PGHS-2 can also produce the PGF2α
needed to initiate parturition.
Physiological processes for which 
PGHS-2 is responsible
Ovulation and implantation. PGHS-2–null female mice
are infertile (3). Although follicular development is
observed in PGHS-2–deficient mice, ovulation is great￾ly reduced and, of the eggs released, very few are fertil￾ized (8). Ovarian PGE2 production is increased by pitu￾itary gonadotropins in wild-type and PGHS-1–null
mice, but not in PGHS-2–null mice, indicating that
PGHS-2 is responsible for this increased ovarian PGE2
production. Because ovulation in PGHS-2–null mice
can be restored by PGE2 administration (11), PGE2
formed via PGHS-2 is believed to be the product that is
responsible for ovulation. In addition to affecting ovu￾Why there are two cyclooxygenase isozymes

lation, PGHS-2 deficiency also impedes blastocyst
implantation and decidualization. PGI2 has been
demonstrated to be the prostanoid involved in this
process, and it is also formed through PGHS-2 (Table
1) (12). Interestingly, although prostanoids appear to
act primarily via G protein–linked receptors (5), the
nuclear peroxisomal proliferator–activated receptor
PPARδ appears to mediate the action of PGI2 in
implantation (12), suggesting that alternative routes
may exist by which PGI2 can influence gene expression.
Neonatal development. Although it is widely believed
that PGHS-1 acts in development, there are few reports
available to support this claim, and recent studies sug￾gest that PGHS-2 plays a more important role, at least
in neonatal development (13, 14). PGHS-2–deficient
mice develop a severe renal pathology that is not mim￾icked by administration of NSAIDs to adult mice (2, 3).
Initially, some investigators believed that this pheno￾type represented a compensatory artifact of the 
PGHS-2 knockout, but Komhoff et al. (13) showed
recently that postnatal treatment with a PGHS-2–selec￾tive NSAID caused a severe reduction in glomerular
diameter in the neonatal mouse kidney. This was the
same renal pathology as seen in PGHS-2–null mice (13)
and could not be caused by treating adult mice with the
PGHS-2–selective inhibitor.
Another neonatal event in the mouse in which 
PGHS-2 has a key role is in the closure of the ductus
arteriosus (14). Although the ductus closes normally in
PGHS-1–null mice, about 35% of PGHS-2–null mice
die with a patent ductus within 48 hours of birth. In
wild-type mice, PGHS-2, but not PGHS-1, is seen by
immunohistochemistry to be significantly induced in
the smooth muscle cells of the ductus during closure;
however, the fact that 65% of COX-2–null mice sur￾vived to weaning suggests that PGHS-1 can play a com￾pensatory role. Indeed, a reduction in PGHS-1 gene
dosage from wild-type to hetrozygosity further increas￾es the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus and de￾creases the 48-hour survival of PGHS-2–null mice to
about 20%. Because a role for PGHS-1 is only evident
when PGHS-2 is absent, it is unlikely that PGHS-1 is
involved in ductus closure in wild-type mice.
These examples indicate that PGHS-2 has key roles
during postpartum development. Because the
birthing process involves a number of physiological
changes and stresses that could induce PGHS-2, and
because PGHS-2–null mice have decreased survival at
all ages, it may be useful to search for other neonatal
tissues in which PGHS-2 induction promotes normal
neonatal development.
Processes involving both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2
Inflammation and wound healing. The relative contribu￾tions of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 to inflammatory
responses are incompletely resolved. Since the identifi￾cation of the PGHS-2 isoform, the hypothesis has been
that PGHS-2 is the primary source of prostanoids that
contribute to inflammation. However, several recent
studies show that prostanoids formed via PGHS-1 are
also involved (1, 15).
Interestingly, some recent studies have indicated that
PGHS-2 acts in both the initiation of the inflammatory
response and in the resolution phase. Gilroy et al. (16)
recently reported that PGHS-2 expression and PGE2 lev￾els increased transiently early in the course of car￾rageenan-induced pleurisy in rats. Later in the response,
PGHS-2 was induced again to even greater levels and
generated anti-inflammatory prostaglandins, such as
PGD2 and 15-deoxy-∆12-14-PGJ2, but only low levels of the
proinflammatory PGE2 (Table 1). Further support for an
anti-inflammatory role of PGHS-2 in this model was the
finding that late administration of the PGHS-2–selective
inhibitor NS-398 exacerbates the inflammatory
response. Furthermore, Wallace et al. (15) observed that
in the paw carrageenan inflammation model, the

inflammation resolves within 7 days in wild-type mice
but is unmitigated over this period in PGHS-2–deficient
mice. Thus, PGHS-2 appears to have two roles in the
inflammatory process, initially contributing to the onset
of inflammation and later helping to resolve the process.
Gastric ulceration. The inhibition of PGHS-1 by
NSAIDs has for many years been considered the bio￾chemical event responsible for gastric ulcer develop￾ment. It was therefore surprising that PGHS-1–defi￾cient mice had a 99% reduction in gastric PGE2 levels
but did not spontaneously develop ulcers (1). Initially,
many researchers attributed this absence of gastric
ulceration in PGHS-1–null mice to compensatory
mechanisms. However, more recently, a novel PGHS￾dependent mechanism of NSAID-induced gastric
ulceration has been reported (17). In these studies, nei￾ther the PGHS-1–selective inhibitor SC-560 nor the
PGHS-2–selective inhibitor celecoxib sufficed to induce
ulcers, but gastric damage occurred when the two
NSAIDs were administered in combination. These
studies may explain why PGHS-1–deficient mice do not
spontaneously develop ulcers. Presumably, if inhibition
of PGHS activity is the sole mechanism of NSAID￾induced ulceration, administering PGHS-1 inhibitors
to PGHS-2–null mice or PGHS-2 inhibitors to 
PGHS-1–null mice would be ulcerogenic.
In addition to its role in resolving inflammation
(15, 16), PGHS-2 has been shown to promote ulcer
healing. Indomethacin-induced ulcers heal poorly in
PGHS-2–null mice compared with wild-type mice and
ultimately prove fatal (15). Like the PGHS-2–deficient
mice, PGHS-2 selective NSAIDs prolong the healing
of ulcers in rats and mice (18, 19). Thus, as in inflam￾mation, there are roles for PGHS-2 in both the onset
and resolution of a disease state, a matter that may be
relevant when considering chronic use of 
PGHS-2–selective drugs.
Carcinogenesis. To date, most studies have implicat￾ed PGHS-2, rather than PGHS-1, as the isoform
involved in colon carcinogenesis. In a recent study,
however, we determined that deficiency for either
PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 reduces polyp formation in Min–/+
mice about equally (∼80%; ref. 20). These studies raise
the question of whether PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 con￾tribute to tumorigenesis through common or differ￾ent mechanisms. Only a speculative answer to this
question can be given at present. Based on recent
work by Houchen et al. (21), it is possible that 
PGHS-1 functions in early stages of tumorigenesis by
protecting initiated stem cells from DNA
damage–induced death, whereas PGHS-2 contributes
to tumor promotion after loss of heterozygosity of
the APC gene has occurred (22). Studies by Chulada et
al. (20) indicate that at the adenoma stage of tumor
development, PGHS-2 is present in the interstitial
cells rather than the epithelial cells of the tumor, and
thus, that prostanoids formed via PGHS-2 exert a
paracrine rather than an autocrine effect to promote
tumor growth. Work with PGHS null mice indicates
that both isozymes contribute to the increased PGE2
production seen in polyps. Overall, these results sug￾gest that both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 play key roles in
intestinal tumorigenesis and that PGHS-1 may also
be an effective chemotherapeutic target for NSAIDs.
Biochemical evidence for unique PGHS-1 
and PGHS-2 biosynthetic pathways
For there to be isozyme-specific effects, PGHS-1 and
PGHS-2 must be able to function independently at the
biochemical level. This can be achieved simply by seg￾regating the isozymes into different cells. However, in
many instances PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are coexpressed
in the same cells. Under the latter conditions, the inde￾pendent functioning of PGHS isozymes appears to
involve metabolic rather than physical segregation of
these enzymes. The two PGHS isozymes are found pre￾dominately in the same organelles, at the lumenal sur￾faces of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear enve￾lope of cells (23), although it is conceivable that each
isoform is localized to a specific subdomain of these
membranes. Neither enzyme appears to interact
directly with cPLA2 or sPLA2s, the phospholipases that
mobilize AA. It is possible that PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 can
bind to the downstream synthases, such as TXA2 syn￾thase, PGI2 synthase, and/or microsomal (m) PGE syn￾thase (all of which enzymes are associated with the
endoplasmic reticulum; refs. 24, 25); however, to date,
there is no evidence for such interactions.
PGHS-2–independent functions of PGHS-1
When PGHS-1 and PGHS–2 are both expressed in the
same cells, supplying AA either exogenously or via acti￾vation of cellular lipases always leads to the function￾ing of PGHS-2. Only when PGHS-2 is absent does
PGHS-1 appear to function independently; but because
PGHS-1 is a constitutive enzyme, whereas PGHS-2 is
inducible, this is actually the usual situation. PGHS-2
is generally present in cells only during early stages of
cell differentiation or replication (25). There is consid￾erable literature on the regulation of PGHS-2 gene
expression, but there is little information about how
the expression of PGHS-1 is controlled (25).
PGHS-1–independent functions of PGHS-2
In vitro at high substrate/enzyme ratios, PGHS-1 and
PGHS-2 have quite similar kinetic properties including
their Km values for AA (∼5 µM; ref. 25). However, the Km
value of PGHS-1 for AA appears to be higher than that
of PGHS-2 when the enzymes are studied in cultured
cells (∼2 µM and 10 µM, respectively; refs. 26, 27). Thus,
in intact cells expressing both isoforms, PGHS-2 can
function in the presence of a nonfunctioning PGHS-1

Prostaglandins and their precursors

if the AA concentrations are kept relatively low. This
mechanism may account for the fact that prostanoids
formed in the so-called “late phase,” a period defined
as occurring 2–6 hours after treating cells with tumor
promoters, cytokines, or growth factors, are formed
primarily via PGHS-2.
The intracellular concentration of free AA depends on
competing actions of various lipases, which mobilize
arachidonate from phosphoglycerides, and CoA ligases,
which scavenge free fatty acids. There is a consensus
that cPLA2 is involved in mobilizing AA for PGHS-1 but
that prostaglandin formation during the late phase and
involving PGHS-2 depends on both cPLA2 and one or
more sPLA2s (see Fitzpatrick and Soberman, this Per￾spective series, ref. 28; see also refs. 27 and 29–31).
The basis of the apparent Km differences between
PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 in intact cells is not clear. How￾ever, this situation can be mimicked in vitro with puri￾fied PGHSs when measuring rates of product forma￾tion at low concentrations of both AA and lipid
hydroperoxide. The biochemical explanation for this
rather complex type of regulation is as follows: PGHSs
catalyze both a cyclooxygenase reaction, in which AA
plus two O2 molecules are converted to PGG2, and a
peroxidase reaction, in which PGG2 is reduced to PGH2
(ref. 25; see also Serhan and Oliw, this Perspective series,
ref. 32). For the cyclooxygenase activities of PGHS-1
and PGHS-2 to function, the heme group at the perox￾idase site must undergo a lipid peroxide-dependent oxi￾dation. The oxidized heme then oxidizes a tyrosine in
the cyclooxygenase site that, in turn, abstracts a hydro￾gen atom from AA, yielding an AA radical that reacts
with O2 to form PGG2 (25) (itself a lipid peroxide). The
concentration of lipid peroxide required to activate the
cyclooxygenase activity of PGHS-1 is about ten times
higher than that necessary for PGHS-2 in the presence
of low AA concentrations (33). Thus, a combination of
(a) low endogenous peroxide concentrations within the
lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where PGHS-1
and PGHS-2 are predominately localized in intact cells
(23) and (b) AA concentrations below 2 µM (i.e., at rel￾atively high enzyme/substrate ratios; refs. 33, 34) would
favor the operation of the cyclooxygenase activity of
PGHS-2 over that of PGHS-1. Regardless of the mech￾anism, it appears that the cyclooxygenase activities of
PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are controlled differentially by
regulating the amount of lipid peroxide and AA avail￾able to the enzymes.
Alternative substrates for PGHS-2. There are subtle dif￾ferences in the fatty acid substrate specificities between
PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 (25), but these are probably of lit￾tle biologic significance beyond ensuring that both
enzymes act on AA in preference to other fatty acids
substrates. However, PGHS-2 but not PGHS-1 can use
esterified fatty acid substrates (35). One example is 2-
arachidonyl glycerol, which can be generated from
phosphatidylinositol by the sequential actions of phos￾pholipase C and diglyceride lipase (35). 2-Arachidonyl
glycerol is formed by a mouse macrophage line and
converted to 2-PGD2 glycerol via PGHS-2 and PGD
synthase (35). This provocative observation raises a
host of questions regarding the relative importance of
the classical and alternative pathways. For example, it
is possible that AA is normally not even the physiolog￾ically relevant substrate for PGHS-2. Considerable fur￾ther work needs to be done on this topic, including
determining whether 2-PGH2 glycerol can be convert￾ed to 2-prostanoid glycerols other than 2-PGD2 glyc￾erol (e.g., 2-PGI2 glycerol).
Coupling of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 to downstream synthases.
A final way in which PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 biosynthetic
pathways may be dissociated metabolically is by a pref￾erential coupling of the isoforms to various downstream
synthases (see Fitzpatrick and Soberman, this Perspec￾tive series, ref. 28). PGHS-2 appears to be coupled meta￾bolically to PGI2 formation in the uterus in association
with decidualization and implantation (12). There also
appears to be an mPGE synthase that is coordinately
induced with PGHS-2 and seems to function preferen￾tially with PGHS-2, rather than PGHS-1 (24, 36).
Concluding remarks
The data obtained with PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 deficient
mice clearly show differences in some physiological
actions of the two isoforms, and some observed physio￾logical roles are quite different from those originally
expected. For example, it was quite surprising that mice
deficient in PGHS-1, the constitutive isoform believed to
be responsible for homeostasis, are healthy and live a nor￾mal life span, whereas mice lacking PGHS-2 expression,
the inducible isoform thought to be expressed primarily
in disease states, display various developmental problems,
female reproductive disorders, and a shortened life span.
Most recent studies have demonstrated a concordance
between the physiological effects of the genetic deficien￾cy of the PGHS isoforms and isoform-specific or -non￾specific effects of NSAIDs. However, both the drug stud￾ies and the studies of PGHS deficient mice have their
limitations. Whereas NSAIDs may cause some of their
effects by mechanisms other than PGHS inhibition, com￾pensation mechanisms or developmental changes may
influence the responses of PGHS-deficient mice. Inflam￾mation, for example, cannot be fully elucidated with
PGHS-2–deficient mice, as PGHS-2 acts at two different
steps in this process, initiation and resolution. Other
prostaglandin-regulated responses may also require
PGHSs to function at multiple steps. On the other hand,
PGHS-null mice probably do model the development of
certain diseases caused by PGHS inhibitors. Furthermore,
in the PGHS-null mice there are examples of the remain￾ing isoform being upregulated and compensating for the
missing isoform; further studies will be needed to deter￾1494 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2001 | Volume 107 | Number 12

mine whether such upregulation contributes to the nor￾mal physiological process as it occurs in wild-type ani￾mals. Future biochemical studies will likely focus on the
mechanisms by which different lipases and downstream
synthases are coupled physically or metabolically to
PGHS-1 and/or PGHS-2, why the Km values for PGHS-1
and PGHS–2 are different in intact cells, and whether AA,
2-arachidonyl glycerol or another lipid is the preferred
substrate for PGHS-2.
