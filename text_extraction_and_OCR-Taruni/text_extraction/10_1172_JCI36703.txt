The renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the etiology of hypertension and the pathophysiology of cardiac
and renal diseases in humans. Ang IIis the central product ofthis system and is involved in regulating immune
responses, inflammation, cell growth, and proliferation by acting through Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1 and
AT2). Here, we show that targeted disruption of the Agtr1a gene that encodes AT1A results in marked prolonga￾tion of life span in mice. Agtr1a–/– mice developed less cardiac and vascular injury, and multiple organs from
these mice displayed less oxidative damage than wild-type mice. The longevity phenotype was associated with
an increased number of mitochondria and upregulation ofthe prosurvival genes nicotinamide phosphoribosyl￾transferase (Nampt) and sirtuin 3 (Sirt3)in the kidney.In cultured tubular epithelial cells, Ang II downregulated
Sirt3 mRNA, and this effect was inhibited by an AT1 antagonist. These results demonstrate that disruption of
AT1 promotes longevity in mice, possibly through the attenuation of oxidative stress and overexpression of pro￾survival genes, and suggests that the Ang II/AT1 pathway may be targeted to influence life span in mammals.
Introduction
High blood pressure is highly prevalent in humans and is associated 
with complications, including heart disease, kidney disease, and 
stroke, which together represent the major (and neglected) health 
problems for high- and middle-income countries that are now 
impending on low-income countries (1). The renin-angiotensin sys￾tem (RAS) has critical functions in regulation of blood pressure and 
cardiovascular physiology (2). Its role in the pathogenesis of a num￾ber of disease states has been well documented, and components of 
the RAS are important pharmacological targets in hypertension and 
cardiovascular disease. Responsiveness to Ang II is conferred by the 
expression of 2 classes of pharmacologically distinct rhodopsin-like 
G protein–associated receptors, the Ang II type 1 and 2 receptors (AT1
and AT2) (3). The effect of Ang II to increase blood pressure and to 
promote various pathologies is mediated by AT1, which is expressed 
in various organ systems, including the heart, blood vessels, kidney, 
adrenal glands, and cardiovascular control centers in the brain (4). 
Targeted disruption of the Agtr1a gene encoding AT1A — the major 
mouse AT1 isoform and mouse homolog to the single human AGTR1
gene (5) — causes a reduction in blood pressure levels. Here, we investi￾gated whether inactivation of Agtr1a gene in mice also confers protec￾tion from cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The present study 
documented that inhibition of AT1 signaling promotes longevity.
Results
Inactivation of AT1A prolongs the life span of mice. A prospective obser￾vational study was performed in 20 homozygous mice deficient 
for AT1A — the major mouse AT1 isoform and the closest murine 
homolog to the single human AT1 (5) — and 10 wild-type controls. 
The animals lacking AT1A substantially outlived their wild-type 
littermates (Figure 1). At 29 months, when all wild-type animals 
died, 17 AT1A-deficient mice (85%) were still alive. These remain￾ing mice lived for an additional 7 months. Comparison of survival 
curves showed a highly significant difference between groups 
(P < 0.0001). The life span of the AT1A-deficient mice was approxi￾mately 26% longer than controls.
Caloric restriction is associated with increased longevity (6–8). 
To assess whether caloric intake was effected by the AT1A muta￾tion, daily food intake was carefully monitored at 19 to 21 months 
of age. Food intake was virtually identical between Agtr1a–/– and 
wild-type mice (Table 1). Small body size is also associated with 
extended life span in diet-restricted mice (9). Body weights were 
slightly but not significantly reduced in Agtr1a–/– compared with 
wild-type littermates until month 18 when they became indistin￾guishable (Figure 2A). Agtr1a–/– mice had normal physical activ￾ity as reflected by their ability to perform on a rotarod (Table 1). 
Adenocarcinoma of the lung was observed in 10%–15% of animals 
in both aging cohorts, an incidence of lung tumor not correlated 
with genotype and lower than previously reported (~30%) in 
C57BL/6 × 129 mice (10).
AT1A knockout mice develop less cardiac and vascular injury. Animals 
were sacrificed when death appeared imminent, and the heart, 
aorta, pancreas, kidney, liver, spleen, and brain were collected to 
assess pathophysiological consequences of AT1A deficiency on 
organ structure. Morphological examination of the various tissues 
revealed major differences between Agtr1a–/– (26 to 30 months old) 
and wild-type animals (26 to 29 months old) in the heart, aorta, 
and pancreas. The heart weight/body weight ratio and left ven￾tricular mass were comparable between Agtr1a–/– and wild-type 
mice (Figure 3, A and B). No difference was found in the number

of cardiomyocytes in transverse sections of left ventricle. By con￾trast, myocyte cross-sectional area, an index of myocyte size, was 
significantly lower in Agtr1a–/– than in wild-type mice (Figure 3C). 
Furthermore, cardiac fibrosis was significantly reduced in AT1A￾deficient animals compared with wild-type controls. For example, 
morphological analysis of serial heart slices showed that deposi￾tion of collagen in interstitial spaces was reduced in the Agtr1a–/–
animals (Figure 3D). Agtr1a–/– mice did not develop lesions 
throughout the aorta (Figure 4A). By contrast, 50% of wild-type 
mice showed a 2-fold increase in atherosclerotic lesions compared 
with Agtr1a–/– animals. Atherosclerotic lesions were characterized 
by fragmentation of lamina elastica of the vessel wall (Figure 4B) 
and intraparietal accumulation of foaming cells destroying layers 
of elastic tunica media (Figure 4C).
While pancreata from Agtr1a–/– mice appeared normal morpho￾logically, wild-type littermates manifested lymphoid aggregates that 
encompassed a substantial proportion of the islets. However, the 
aggregates rarely penetrated the islets and were not associated with 
necrosis. To determine whether insulitis in wild-type mice resulted 
in a loss of β cells, staining for insulin was performed in pancreatic 
tissue. The extent of staining for insulin was virtually identical in 
Agtr1a–/–and wild-type mice, thereby indicating a comparable num￾ber of insulin-secreting cells. There was no difference in fasting glu￾cose levels between Agtr1a–/– and wild-type mice (Figure 2B).
Kidney histology showed mild tubular pathology, effecting 
less than 25% of tubuli in few animals of both strains. Changes 
in glomeruli, including mesangial/intracapillary hypercellularity 
and mesangiolysis, were not different in Agtr1a–/– and wild-type 
mice. Analysis of the liver revealed mild hydropic degeneration 
of hepatocytes in Agtr1a–/– mice. At variance, in wild-type animals 
marked hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes, macro- and microve￾sicular steatosis and mild exudation were observed. Mild vascular 
congestion of the red pulp of the spleen was observed in both 
strains. Mild edema of the white substance of the brain was present 
in both Agtr1a–/– and wild-type mice at a comparable extent.
Renal function is normal in AT1A knockout mice. Urinary protein 
excretion levels were within the normal range in Agtr1a–/– and wild￾type mice (24 months old, 4.81 ± 4.19 versus 5.56 ± 2.42 mg/day, 
respectively). Twenty-four-hour urinary volumes were relatively 
constant in both groups but were higher in Agtr1a–/– mice (1–1.6 
ml/day) compared with the wild-type group (0.6–1 ml/day), consis￾tent with an impaired urinary concentrating mechanism described 
previously in these animals (11). Renal function did not change 
during the study and was comparable between groups (blood urea 
nitrogen [BUN] at 24 months old, Agtr1a–/–, 21.5 ± 7.17 versus wild￾type, 19.1 ± 6.31 mg/dl).
Lack of AT1A reduces oxidative damage and prevents age-induced mito￾chondrial loss. Accumulation of oxidative damage inflicted by reac￾tive oxygen species is the major cause of aging in invertebrates and 
mammalians (12). An excess formation of peroxynitrite, the reaction 
product of nitric oxide and superoxide anion (O2
–), has been taken 
to reflect increased lipid peroxidation and oxidation of structural 
proteins (13). The expression of nitrotyrosine, a marker of peroxyni￾trite production, was increased in cardiomyocytes, aortas, and kid￾neys obtained from aged animals (26 to 29 months old) compared 
with 2-month-old mice (Figure 5, A and B). By contrast, nitrotyro￾sine staining was reduced in cardiomyocytes, aortas, and kidneys 
from Agtr1a–/– mice (26 to 30 months old) with respect to aged wild￾type mice; however, these values were not significantly different 
from those of 2-month-old mice (Figure 5, A and B), suggesting that 
absence of AT1A protects tissues from oxidative damage.
Mitochondria, the main cellular source of reactive oxygen spe￾cies, are particularly sensitive to oxidant damage. Kidney proximal 
tubular cells possess large numbers of mitochondria and are highly 
dependent on mitochondrial energy production for proper func￾tion (14). In wild-type mice, the numerical density of mitochondria 
in proximal tubule cells was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) in aged 
(26 to 29 months old) compared with 2-month-old animals (Figure 
6, A and B). A lack of AT1A protected mice from this loss of mito￾chondria as animals aged (P < 0.01; Figure 6, A and B). Abnormali￾ties in mitochondria density were not accompanied with changes 
in mean mitochondria volume (Figure 6B).
Longevity of AT1A knockout mice is associated with increased renal 
expression of survival genes. Studies have shown that in the context of 
nutrient restriction, mitochondria dictate cell survival through the 
upregulation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), 
which by boosting mitochondrial NAD+ provides the cosubstrate 
for SIRT3, a member of the sirtuin family linked to life span exten￾sion (15, 16). We therefore evaluated whether Nampt and Sirt3, 
which are highly expressed in mitochondria, were differentially 
regulated in long-term surviving mice lacking AT1A. Quantitative 
real-time PCR showed that transcript levels of both Nampt and 
Sirt3 were significantly increased in kidneys from Agtr1a–/– mice 
(26 to 30 months old) with respect to wild-type animals (26 to 29 
months old) (Figure 7). Since overexpression of SIRT1 modulates 
mitochondrial biogenesis (17), transcript levels of Sirt1 were also 
evaluated. No change in Sirt1 mRNA expression was detected in 
kidneys from Agtr1a–/– mice (26 to 30 months old) with respect to 
wild-type animals (26 to 29 months old) (Figure 7).
Ang II downregulates Nampt and Sirt3 expression via AT1A in cultured 
mouse proximal tubular epithelial cells. To determine whether Ang II

directly effects the expression of Nampt and Sirt3 via AT1, in vitro 
experiments were performed in mouse proximal tubular epithe￾lial cells (PTECs) exposed to Ang II in the presence or absence of 
candesartan. Nampt and Sirt3 mRNA expression, evaluated by real￾time PCR, was downregulated by Ang II challenge. Preincubation 
of mouse PTECs with candesartan prevented the reduction of 
Nampt and Sirt3 transcript expression in response to Ang II (Figure 
8A). To further evaluate whether Ang II–induced downregulation 
of Nampt could impact Sirt3 expression, we assessed Sirt3 expres￾sion in PTECs transfected with specific Nampt siRNA. Twenty-five 
nanomoles of Nampt siRNA effectively reduced the expression of 
Nampt mRNA by 67% (Figure 8B). Silencing the Nampt gene pre￾vented the decrease of Sirt3 mRNA induced by Ang II, thereby indi￾cating a causative role of Nampt in Sirt3 expression.
Discussion
In the present study, we have found that targeted disruption of 
AT1A translated into marked prolongation of the life span of mice. 
We used the F1 progeny of the (C57BL/6 × 129/SvEv)Agtr1a–/–
strain, generated by intercrossing 2 inbred lines, which is ideal for 
the aging studies because animals lack structural or developmen￾tal abnormalities. Furthermore, since each F1 mouse has the same 
genotype across the entire genome, they are genetically pure; each 
F1 animal is genetically identical to the next. This would obvi￾ously change in subsequent crosses, and, therefore, we used only 
F1(C57BL/6 × 129/SvEv) mice differing at the Agtr1a gene locus 
(+ or –). A theoretical limitation of the use of animals with a mixed￾strain background is the effect of strain-specific genes linked to the 
targeted allele. In fact, the null allele of Agtr1a–/– strain could con￾tain a small amount of tightly linked genomic DNA from 129 not 
present in the wild-type B6 allele. However, because the life spans 
of wild-type 129 and C57BL/6 are very similar, it seems highly 
unlikely that a strain-specific gene linked to the 129 Agtr1a locus 
could explain the robust survival differences seen in our studies. 
Moreover, some have argued against using inbred mouse lines for 
aging studies, since many of these lines harbor recessive mutations 
predisposing to tumors or other disorders that independently 
effect survival. In this regard, F1 mice may offer advantages over 
the parental inbred lines for this sort of experiment.
Animals lacking AT1A developed fewer aortic atherosclerotic lesions 
and less cardiac damage, as reflected by the reduction in myocyte size 
and fibrosis, with lower deposition of interstitial collagen with respect 
to wild-type mice. This is in line with recent studies investigating the 
role of Ang II in end-organ damage, showing that a knockin mouse 
model with gain-of-function mutation of AT1 developed progres￾sive cardiac fibrosis with increased expression of collagen (18). These 
results point to a direct action of Ang II through AT1A in regulating 
extracellular matrix production by cardiac fibroblasts (19).
Oxidative stress is a principal contributor to aging. In the fly and 
the mouse, gene mutations that enhance resistance to environ￾mental stresses extend life span (12). Ang II increases vascular O2
–
production and induces endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme 
uncoupling, which may further enhance oxidative stress in vascu￾lar tissue, thereby decreasing nitric oxide availability. Nitric oxide, 
by interacting with O2
–, forms peroxynitrite, a cytotoxic anion that 
inhibits mitochondrial electron transport (20). The observation in 
the present study of reduced production of peroxynitrite in hearts, 
aortas, and kidneys from Agtr1a–/– compared with wild-type mice 
would imply that Ang II effected organ senescence through induc￾tion of oxidative stress via AT1.
Oxidative damage to mitochondria could account for some of 
the age-related changes in their function. Tissues from aging ani￾mals have a reduced number of mitochondria (14) that show func￾tional changes, including increased superoxide and H2O2 genera￾tion and decreased energy production (21). An important finding 
of the present study was that prolonged survival of Agtr1a–/– mice

was associated with preservation of the number of mitochon￾dria in the renal PTECs. These results are consistent with previ￾ous descriptions of a beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibition to preserve mitochondria in aging mice (22).
Mitochondrial SIRT3 and SIRT4, members of histone deacety￾lase family that use NAD+ as cosubstrate, appear to play a role in 
the longevity network that maintains mitochondrial vitality (23). 
In the context of nutrient restriction, the expression of the Nampt
gene, the mammalian equivalent of the yeast longevity gene PNC1,
increases. Enhanced Nampt expression leads to the accumulation 
of its biosynthetic product NAD+ in mitochondria, which in turn 
promotes cell survival via activation of mitochondrial SIRT3 and 
SIRT4 (16). Here, we wondered whether high levels of Ang II mea￾sured in Agtr1a–/– mice (24) could induce Nampt gene, which in turn 
may have prevented age-induced mitochondria death, as it occurs 
as a consequence of caloric restriction (16). We found that both 
Nampt and Sirt3 were upregulated in the kidneys of long-term 
surviving mice lacking AT1A with respect to wild-type littermates. 
Our data would suggest that Nampt and Sirt3 may play a role in 
promoting mitochondria vitality in Agtr1a–/– mice, contributing to 
prolong survival. Whether increased sirtuin expression is the effect 
rather than the cause of increased mitochondrial maintenance is 
worth investigating. The finding that candesartan prevented Ang II–
induced Nampt and Sirt3 mRNA reduction in cultured tubular epi￾thelial cells can be taken to suggest a possible biochemical link 
between Ang II and survival genes, which conceivably operates via 
AT1. Furthermore, experiments showing that Nampt gene silencing 
by siRNA limited the reduction of Sirt3 mRNA induced by Ang II 
would indicate a causative role of Nampt in modulating Sirt3 gene 
transcription in response to Ang II.
Data are available that indicate that life span extension in mice is 
associated with reduced insulin receptor signaling cascade, which 
upregulates the expression of sirtuin proteins (15, 25). There is the 
possibility that AT1A deficiency reduces oxidation of the compo￾nents of insulin receptor signaling pathway, which may enhance 
SIRT3 expression (26). The extension of life span described here 
is comparable to that of mice lacking the insulin growth factor-1 
(IGF-1) receptor (27) or the p66 isoform of the proto-oncogene 
Shc, the major transduction molecule of IGF-1 receptor (28). Of 
note, prolonged survival induced by resveratrol (29) — a small mol￾ecule found in red wine that activates Sirt1 and mimics the anti￾aging effect of caloric restriction — is associated with increased 
mitochondrial number (29) and is dependent on the upregulation 
of Sir2 (30). Moreover, resveratrol downregulates AT1 through 
Sirt1 activation in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and 
mouse aorta, implying that inhibition of AT1 contributes to res￾veratrol-induced longevity (31). The finding here that Sirt1 mRNA 
transcript levels were comparable in the kidneys from Agtr1a–/– and 
wild-type mice would suggest that the longevity pattern described 
here is independent from Sirt1 pathway.
Sirtuins can be therefore regarded as a potential therapeutic 
target for diseases of aging and to extend life. This is consistent 
with findings that Sir2 homologs do actually prolong life span in 
worms and flies, mimicking the life-prolonging effects of caloric 
restriction (30). Activators of Sirt1 ameliorate insulin resistance 
and enhance mitochondrial capacity in experimental diabetes 
(32). However, manipulating the sirtuin pathway in humans is 
not imminently feasible. In contrast, AT1 antagonists have been 
proven to be safe and well tolerated for chronic use and are used 
as a key component of the modern therapy for hypertension and 
cardiac failure (33). Data are also available that suggest that these 
molecules share renal and cardiac protective properties (33, 34). 
Specifically, long-term inhibition of the RAS by either angioten￾sin-converting enzyme inhibitors or Ang II receptor antagonist 
protected rats from the deleterious process of aging on the car￾Figure 4

diovascular system and induced a substantial extension of ani￾mal life span (34).
In summary, we have provided evidence that AT1A deficiency 
increases life span in mice. Longevity was likely the consequence 
of reduced mitochondrial damage due to the attenuation of oxida￾tive stress and the upregulation of Nampt and Sirt3 survival genes. 
Our study offers a rationale for exploring the possibility that AT1
antagonists prolong life in humans.
Methods
Mice. Male F1(C57BL/6 × 129/SvEv) mice lacking AT1A for Ang II were 
obtained and bred in the animal facility of the Durham Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center under the NIH guidelines (5) and then maintained in 
the animal facility of the “Mario Negri” Institute for Pharmacological 
Research in conformity with the institutional guidelines that are in com￾pliance with national (Decreto Legislativo n.116, Gazzetta Ufficiale suppl 
40, 18 febbraio 1992, Circolare n.8, Gazzetta Ufficiale 14 luglio 1994) and 
international laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609, OJL358-1, 
December 1987; Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. NIH publi￾cation no. 85-23. Revised 1996). All animal studies were approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of “Mario Negri” Institute 
for Pharmacological Research. After generating the targeted disruption 
of the Agtr1a gene locus (35), this mutation was back-crossed for mul￾tiple generations (>12) onto several inbred genetic backgrounds, includ￾ing C57BL/6 and 129/SvEv. However, renal structural abnormalities were 
found in AT1A-deficient mice on these 2 backgrounds (36), making them 
unsuitable for physiological studies. By contrast, kidney abnormalities 
were not seen in F1(C57BL/6 × 129/SvEv)Agtr1a–/– mice. The lack of struc￾tural or developmental abnormalities along with their genetic homogene￾ity render the F1(C57BL/6 × 129/SvEv)Agtr1a–/– mice ideal for the aging 
studies carried out here. Animals were housed in a constant temperature 
room, with a 12-hour dark/12-hour light cycle, and allowed free access to 
standard diet (4RF21 GLP certificate, Mucedola srl; 12.0% water, 18.5% 
protein, 3.0% fat, 6.0% fiber, 7.0% ash; metabolizable energy, 2,668 kCal/kg) 
and water. Heart, aorta, pancreas, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, and brain 
specimens were collected for histological analysis from 7 Agtr1a–/– mice 
(26 to 30 months old) and 4 wild-type mice (26 to 29 months old) that 
were killed when death appeared imminent. Organs were collected in 10% 
formalin, except for the pancreas (collected in Bouin’s solution) and the 
kidney (collected in Duboscq-Brazil), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned 
at 3 μm for hematoxylin-eosin staining. For morphometrical analysis of 
mitochondria and oxidative stress evaluation, additional 2-month-old 
wild-type mice (n = 4) were considered.
Biochemical measurements. Blood glucose levels were measured with a 
reflectance meter (A. Menarini Diagnostics) at month 24, after overnight 
fasting. Renal function was assessed as BUN in heparinized blood by the 
Reflotron test (Roche Diagnostics). BUN levels of more than 30 mg/dl 
were considered abnormal. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were col￾lected using clean metabolic cages, and proteinuria was determined by 
the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), using bovine serum 
albumin as standard.
Immunofluorescence for insulin. Sections (3 μm) from OCT frozen pan￾creatic tissue were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-insulin antibody 
(1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) followed by goat anti-rabbit FITC￾conjugated antibody (1:50; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.).
Heart morphometry. Tissue was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and 
sectioned at 5 μm for hematoxylin-eosin and at 10 μm for collagen stain￾ing (0.1% Sirius red in picric acid). Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area 
was measured by manually tracing the cell contour on images acquired 
on the Image Analyzer IBAS 2.0 (Kontron/Zeiss image analysis system) 
at ×400 magnification from at least 50 cardiomyocytes in each section 
(37). The total number and volume of cardiomyocytes were determined 
by quantitative morphometric analysis (38). Collagen content was quan￾tified in digitally acquired images and expressed as fractional area of 
the entire section. The nature of Sirius red–stained collagen deposit was 
confirmed by examination under a microscope equipped with polarized 
light that renders collagen fibers birefringent. Interstitial collagen was 
quantified as described (37).

1 μm. (B) The number of mitochondria per volume in proximal tubular 
cells in aged wild-type animals was decreased with respect to wild-type 
2-month-old and Agtr1a–/– mice. Agtr1a–/– animals showed the same 
numerical density as wild-type 2-month-old animals. *P < 0.01 ver￾sus wild-type 2-month-old and Agtr1a–/– animals by ANOVA corrected 
with Bonferroni coefficient. Mean mitochondria volume evaluated on 
the same transmission electron micrographs through morphometrical 
analysis did not differ among groups. Data are mean ± SD.

Lack of AT1A is associated with increased levels of Nampt and Sirt3 
in the kidney. By real-time PCR, whole kidney expression of both 
Nampt and Sirt3 was increased in Agtr1a–/– (26 to 30 months old) with 
respect to wild-type (26 to 29 months old) mice. Renal expression of 
Sirt1 mRNA was comparable in the 2 strains. Data are mean ± SD of 4 
animals. *P < 0.05 versus wild-type by ANOVA corrected with Bonfer￾roni coefficient.

Immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine staining. Paraffin-embedded aorta and 
heart sections (3 μm) were treated with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS and incubated 
overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine IgG (1:500; Upstate Bio￾technology) and further with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (1:200) and Vec￾tastain ABC kit and DAB reagents (Vector Laboratories). Frozen kidney sec￾tions (3 μm) were heated for 20 minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 
antigen retrieval. After incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine 
IgG (1:500), the sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Cy3-coniugated 
antibody (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) and counter￾stained with lectin FITC-conjugated antibody (1:400; Vector Laboratories). 
Ten to twenty fields (magnification, ×200) of aorta or renal tubuli for each 
section were analyzed, and the scoring (0, absent; 1, faint; 2, moderate; 3, 
intense) of nitrotyrosine staining was calculated as a weighed mean.
Estimation of mitochondrial numerical density and mean volume. Glutaralde￾hyde-fixed fragments of cortical kidney tissue were washed in cacodylate 
buffer, postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon resin. 
Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate for examination, using 
a Philips Morgagni transmission electron microscope (Philips). Numeri￾cal density of mitochondria (NV, n/μm3) was estimated by morphometrical 
analysis (39), using an orthogonal grid digitally superimposed over digi￾tized electron microscope pictures of proximal tubules at ×7,100. Mito￾chondrial profile area density (NA) was estimated by the ratio between the 
number of mitochondria and the proximal tubular area in the image cal￾culated on the basis of grid points. Mitochondrial volume density (VV) was 
determined by the ratio of grid points falling over mitochondria divided 
by the total number of points of the grid contained in proximal tubule sec￾tion. NV was then estimated for each animal using the formula NV = (1/β) 
(NA3/2/VV
1/2), in which β is the shape coefficient for ellipsoidal mitochon￾dria, calculated from the ratio of the harmonic mean of major and minor 
axis of mitochondria sections measured on digital images. The mean mito￾chondrial volume was calculated for each animal as the ratio of mitochon￾drial volume density VV and numerical density NV.
Cell culture and incubation. SV40-transformed murine PTEC lines (pro￾vided by Eric G. Neilson, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, 
USA) were grown in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 10% FCS (Invitrogen) 
supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mM; Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/ml; 
Invitrogen), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Cells were main￾tained in serum-free DMEM for 24 hours before and during the experi￾ments (16). To investigate the effect of Ang II on Nampt, Sirt1, and Sirt3
gene expression, PTECs were exposed for 3 hours to medium (control) or 
1 μM Ang II (Calbiochem) in the presence or absence of the AT1 antagonist 
candesartan (0.1 μM; AstraZeneca). Cells were incubated with candesartan 
1 hour before and during the incubation with Ang II.
RNA interference. The Nampt-specific siRNA sequence (5′-UAAUUGGAU￾ACCAGGACUGaa-3′) was designed according to the complete sequence of 
mouse Nampt gene (GenBank accession number 10946947). In addition, a 
19-bp scrambled siRNA, a sequence with no significant homology to any 
known gene sequences from mouse, rat, or human, was used as negative 
control for RNA interference. siNampt (Silencer Select Pre-designed siRNAs, 
catalog no. s81814) and negative control siRNA (catalog no. 4611) were 
synthesized by Ambion.
For silencing of Nampt, PTECs grown on 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) 
were transfected with Nampt siRNA (25 nM) or negative control siRNA using 
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tion. After 6 hours of treatment with the siRNA reaction mixture, RNA/lipid 
complexes were removed and cells were incubated in DMEM for a further 45 
hours. To investigate the effect of Ang II on Nampt and Sirt3 gene expression 
after treatment with siRNA, PTECs were exposed for 3 hours to medium 
(control) or 1 μM Ang II, then collected and used for RNA extraction.
Real-time PCR of Nampt, Sirt1, and Sirt3. Total RNA was extracted from 
kidneys and PTECs using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s 
instruction (Invitrogen). Purified RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed. To 
amplify cDNA, TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) 
was used according to the manufacturer’s instruction and inventoried 
TaqMan assay Mn01293560_m1 was used for Nampt, Mn01168521_m1 
was used for Sirt1, and Mn01275638_m1 was used for Sirt3, and a mouse 
β-actin endogenous control (VIC/MGB probe) was also used. The PCR was 
performed on the 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). We

Ang II downregulates Nampt and Sirt3 mRNA via AT1. After 24-hour 
incubation with serum-free DMEM, PTECs were incubated with can￾desartan (0.1 μM) or medium for 1 hour and then exposed to Ang II 
(1 μM) or medium (control) for 3 hours. The black column represents 
unstimulated cells maintained in medium (control) for 4 hours. Nampt
and Sirt3 mRNA levels were evaluated by real-time PCR. Data are

modulates Sirt3 gene transcription in response to Ang II. After 6 hour 
transfection with Nampt siRNA, cells were maintained in medium for 
45 hours and then incubated 3 hours with Ang II. Data are mean ± SD 
of 3 experiments. *P < 0.01 versus control, ‡P < 0.01 versus siRNA 
control plus Ang II by Student’s t test for unpaired data (left panel) or 
ANOVA corrected with Bonferroni coefficient (right panel).

used the ΔΔCt technique to calculate cDNA content in each sample using 
the cDNA expression in mouse wild-type or control PTECs as calibrator.
Statistics. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. The time occurrence of death 
(months) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival functions. 
Time-to-event (death) was calculated in months. Survival distribution 
between the 2 groups of mice was compared by log-rank test. ANOVA with 
Bonferroni correction or the 1-tailed Student’s t test for unpaired data were 
used as appropriate. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to be sta￾tistically significant.
