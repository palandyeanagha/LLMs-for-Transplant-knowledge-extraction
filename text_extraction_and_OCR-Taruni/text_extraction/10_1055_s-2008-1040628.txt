Fulminant hepatic failure is the clinical syn￾drome associated with acute massive necrosis of 
liver cells. It is characterized by the sudden onset of 
progressive jaundice, decrease in size of the liver, 
fetor hepaticus, and hepatic encephalopathy within 
eight weeks of acute illness. This syndrome carries a 
mortality rate of more than 80% when the patient 
develops grand IV hepatic en~ephalopathy.l*~ The 
depth of encephalopathy is important as an index of 
the severity of hepatic failure and in the assessment 
of the prognosis. Other systemic manifestations of 
fulminant hepatic failure include hypoglycemia, 
metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, renal impair￾ment, coagulopathy, and bacteremia. 
Fulminant hepatic failure is treated with non￾specific supportive medical measures. Plasma or 
whole blood exchange and charcoal hemoperfusion 
therapy have been tried with some suc~ess.~~~ These 
treatments may prevent or correct some of the 
systemic complications of this syndrome and allow 
enough time for the liver to regenerate. However, 
when the liver cells are destroyed beyond the level 
of potential regeneration, all supportive measures 
are fruitless without liver replacement. For many 
years, there has been an interest in treating fulmi￾nant hepatic failure by liver transplantation. Until 
recently, this could not be achieved because of a 
generally low success rate (one-year survival rate of 
33% with azathioprine-prednisone therapy) and a 
lack of organ donors at the appropriate time. Both

of these obstacles had been partly eliminated in the 
last few years. The one-year survival after liver 
transplantation has improved to over 70% with 
cyclosporine-steroid therapy, and more donors have 
become available due to an increasing public aware￾ness of the need. 
When a complete summary of a 19-year experi￾ence was brought up-to-date to May 1982,~ there 
had been only one attempt at the treatment of 
fulminant hepatic failure by transplantation, the 
recipient being a youth with fulminant B-virus 
hepatitis (OT 87). Numerous other candidates had 
been referred either to the University of Colorado 
(through 1980) or to the University of Pittsburgh. 
However, almost all of these patients died while a 
search was being conducted for an appropriate 
donor. A very few recovered. During the last three 
years, durther attempts have been made to treat pa￾tients with fulminant hepatic failure, and now with 
some success. 
We report here eight attempts at hepatic re￾placement under these dire circumstances during the 
last 36 months. The causes of massive hepatic 
necrosis were variable, ranging from drug intoxica￾tion to viral hepatitis. Although the perioperative 
mortality has been high, primarily because of irre￾versible brain injury and severe systemic complica￾tions, four of these eight patients have recovered 
fully. 
In this article, we will consider three issues. 
First will be the appropriate bare bones evaluation 
and preoperative management that are designed to 
allow a decision to be made about the potential re￾versibility of the acute hepatic disease. The second 
will consider the special technical and other peri￾operative problems that may be important. Third, 
we will report our results.

PRETRANSPLANT EVALUATION 
AND MANAGEMENT 
Acute massive hepatic necrosis usually results 
from viral hepatitis (Type A, Type B, or a 
presumed non-A, non-B virus infection), drug 
(hypersensitivity or overdose), or toxic chemicals. 
The cause of fulminant hepatic failure must be 
determined not only to assess the prognosis of the 
acute illness, but also to prevent further injury to 
an already damaged liver. A carefully obtained 
medical history usually will disclose the exposure to 
a hepatitis virus or to toxic chemicals, recently ad￾ministered potentially hepatotoxic medications, and 
the accidental or suicidal overdose of drugs. Sero￾logic tests for hepatitis viruses and chemical analysis 
of blood for toxic agents can often confirm a sus￾pected etiology. 
Determination of the prognosis of the acute ill￾ness is a prime objective of the workup of patients 
with massive hepatic necrosis who are being con￾sidered for liver transplantation. Development of 
hepatic encephalopathy and its rapid progression is 
the most ominous prognostic sign, and papillary 
edema indicates significant cerebral edema which 
leads to brain death. After grade 111 or IV encepha￾lopathy develops, systemic complications such as 
renal failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bactere￾mia, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis become 
increasingly frequent. These are also grave prog￾nostic signs. Since liver transplantation in the 
presence of grade IV encephalopathy or in the 
presence of severe systemic complications is usually 
unsuccessful, the timing of the liver replacement 
before these complications are themselves irreversi￾ble is essential. Rapidly reducing size of the liver, 
increasing serum bilirubin, markedly prolonged pro￾thrombin time, hypoglycemia, and progressive renal 
failure (hepatorenal syndrome) are all indications of 
serious hepatic failure which may require liver re￾placement. A decision for liver transplantation for 
fulminant liver failure is one of the most difficult 
clinical judgments even for an experienced hepato￾logist who has followed the patient on an hourly 
basis since the onset of illness. As the results of 
liver transplantation have improved significantly 
over the last five years, the decision seems to have 
become less agonizing than before. 
As soon as potential need of liver transplanta￾tion is raised for a patient with fulminant hepatic 
failure, the transplant team should begin a search 
for a suitable organ donor. Age, sex, ABO-blood 
group, weight, and height of the potential recipient 
are reported to the regional organ bank, and these 
also are listed on a nationwide computer system. At 
the same time, anatomic and physiologic conditions 
of the potential recipient are assessed. Past medical 
histories are carefully reviewed, with particular at￾tention to previous abdominal surgery and past car￾diovascular and pulmonary diseases. The size of the 
liver, state of the biliary system, and patency of the 
portal vein are determined with ultrasonography. 
Infectious complications such as pneumonia, 
urinary tract infection, bacteremia or spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis are looked for and if present, 
must be treated adequately before operation. The 
hemodynamic status of the patient should be moni￾tored closely by using a Swan-Ganz catheter. In￾travenous fluid therapy is managed carefully, par￾ticularly when renal impairment is developing. 
Endotracheal intubation and respiratory assist is 
necessary to prevent the development of aspiration 
pneumonia or to correct acid-based imbalances. 
Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common complication 
of fulminant hepatic failure. Gastric acidity should 
be reduced by intensive antiacid therapy, and 
coagulation abnormalities must be corrected by 
fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitated plasma, plate￾let transfusion, and/or epsilon-aminocaproic acid. 
In order to prevent the patient with grade IV 
encephalopathy from progressing to brain death 
from cerebral edema, intracranial pressure may be 
reduced by mannitol infusion, or the encephalop￾athy may be reduced by plasma exchange or char￾coal hemoperfusion, if indicated. Aggressive 
medical management to prevent or treat systemic 
complications of fulminant hepatic failure plays an 
important role in the successful therapy of this 
grave illness, whether or not liver replacement is 
decided upon. 
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT 
The hemodynamic changes in fulminant 
hepatic failure are similar to those in septic shock, 
an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in 
systemic vascular resistance. Further hemodynamic 
derangements during transplant operation can lead 
to cardiac failure or arrest, which can aggravate the 
damage to an already injured central nervous 
system. Irreversible cerebral cortical damage or even 
brain death has been all too common when liver 
replacement was carried out on a patient in grade 
IV encephalopathy. The most significant hemo￾dynamic changes during liver transplantation occur 
when the recipient's diseased liver is being removed 
and replaced by the donor liver (anhepatic phase). 
In the past, both the inferior vena caval flow and 
the portal venous flow were interrupted during this

anhepatic phase, which added significant mortality 
and morbidity to the operation. The new veno￾venous bypass system without systemic hepariniza￾tion6 has virtually eliminated this period of hemo￾dynamic instability. The inferior caval and portal 
venous blood are returned to the superior vena cava 
system by the veno-venous bypass system during the 
anhepatic phase. The cardiac output is thereby 
maintained. This bypass system should be used in 
every liver transplantation for fulminant hepatic 
failure because even a slight further decrease in 
cerebral blood flow can result in irreversible brain 
injury. Perioperative electroencephalographic 
(EEG) monitoring is useful to diagnose additional 
cerebral insults and to correct them, if possible, 
with mannitol infusion to reduce intracranial pres￾sure. Additional oxygenation or other means to 
protect the brain from serious injury may be con￾sidered. Seizure activity under general anesthesia 
may only be recognized by EEG monitoring. The 
seizure should be adequately controlled with various 
kinds of anticonvulsant therapy. 
Severe coagulopathy should be corrected ag￾gressively perioperatively using fresh frozen or cryo￾precipitated plasma, platelet transfusion, and, if 
fibrinolysis is present, with epsilon-aminocaproic 
acid. Thromboelastography is very useful in moni￾toring rapidly changing coagulopathy during trans￾plant surgery. Adequate coagulation is necessary 
not only to minimize the blood loss, but also to pre￾vent intracranial hemorrhage during the periopera￾tive period. 
From the technical point of view, liver trans￾plantation for fulminant hepatic failure is relatively 
easy. However, in the presence of rapidly deteri￾orating metabolism and physiology, the operation 
has to be done smoothly and quickly in order to 
restore normal liver function as quickly as possible. 
Immediate good graft function is essential. 
RESULTS OF LIVER TRANSPLANTATION 
FOR FULMINANT HEPATIC FAILURE 
Eight patients with fulminant hepatic failure 
have received orthotopic liver transplantation under 
cyclosporine-steroid therapy at the University 
Health Center of Pittsburgh before July 1985. The 
clinical data of these eight recipients are summar￾ized in Table 1. All eight patients had had normally 
functioning livers prior to an acute episode of liver 
disease and had developed progressive jaundice, 
coagulopathy, and some degree of hepatic encepha￾lopathy within several weeks. 
The cause of massive hepatic necrosis was an 
adverse reaction to medication in three patients (OT 
283, gold sodium thiomalate; OT 452, sodium val￾proate; OT 541, phenytoin sodium), presumed non￾A, non-B virus hepatitis in three patients (OT 341, 
OT 373, OT 410), B-virus hepatitis in one patient 
(OT 469), and accidental inhalation of paint fumes 
in closed space in one patient (OT 283). 
Two patients (OT 283, OT 298) had developed 
severe renal failure and massive gastrointestinal 
bleeding before transplantation. Two patients (OT 
341, OT 541) had been already in grade IVa 
encephalopathy, and two others (OT 283, OT 469) 
had been in deep grade I11 or occasionally in grade 
IVa encephalopathy immediately preoperatively. 
Four patients (OT 283, OT 298, OT 341, OT 
541) died between 2 days and 31 days after trans￾plantation from various causes as listed in Table 1. 
Both of the patients (OT 341, OT 541) who were 
definitely in grade IVa encephalopathy at the time 
of transplant died without any improvement of 
neurologic function. Both of the patients (OT 283, 
OT 298) who had had severe renal failure and 
massive gastrointestinal bleeding at the time of 
transplant also died. 
The other 4 patients (OT 373, OT 410, OT 452, 
OT 469) are alive between the ninth and seventeenth 
month postoperatively with good liver function. 
Neurologic recoveries of surviving patients have 
been complete without any residual defects in all 
but one patient. This exceptional patient (OT 452) 
had regained full consciousness a few days after 
successful liver replacement, but a myoclonic sei￾zure disorder, which had started two months before 
transplantation, has progressed to the point of 
minimum cerebral cortical function since the second 
post-transplant month; the patient is now cared for 
at a nursing home. 
One patient (OT 469) with fulminant B-virus 
hepatitis is alive and well with normal liver func￾tions in the ninth month after transplant. This pa￾tient was treated with 100 ml of anti-B virus immu￾noglobulin during the anhepatic phase of transplant 
and one month later. He has now antibodies against 
hepatitis B surface antigen, e-antigen and core 
antigen. 
CONCLUSION 
Although our experience is limited, liver trans￾plantation seems to be an acceptable therapeutic 
option for fulminant hepatic failure when suppor￾tive medical measures appear to be failing. In the 
presence of grade IV encephalopathy, severe renal 
failure, and massive gastrointestinal bleeding, liver 
replacement will probably fail. Because the survival

absolute contraindication of liver transplantation,
